Make a hedge fund owner go on national TV to brag about his gains without knowing anything about the business lol

No but seriously it's a lending company
UPST is a scam company, nobody wants their loans because they are private and come without protections or limitations on debt collection - they can show up at your wedding and stalk you in your living room if they want to collect on the loan.

Always good to have an exit strategy. Buy multiple contracts so when you are up sell as much as you need to break even or even lock in some profits, and then the rest are essentially free, so you don't have to worry about losing it all. The best trading comes with confidence, and that means understanding risk management.

Lol
Logic nowhere to be found. One of the top comments on a r/news post was a person saying that they don't want to be helped by an unvaccinated EMT in an emergency. Yeah when they're bleeding out in a car wreck, I'm sure they'll want dispatch to take their sweet time to verify the vaccination status of the nearest available responding units.
Huh, you got a reference for ‚Äúa‚Äùvs. ‚Äúan‚Äù when preceding acronyms?

That's good I like that
Good reminder to never sell anything ever
Maybe my mind is a bit twisted. Maybe I should wish baba further green, and put that free cash elsewhere. But in What?i I believe the market is in bubble, and I also believe BABA can survive it. BA call, maybe?
you shouldn't be aiming to hit the exact bottom or top. If you manage to do it, you are extremely lucky but 90% of the time the main goal is to get out with profits. Smash and grab vs full on diamond hands autist I guess

Trade around a core position so you can buy a higher-low. Leave runners so you at least can try and time a few as close to the top as possible. Key word is profits, so lock in profits and you get a lot more flexibility.

100%, you can easily choose to be give your children those same privileges if you apply yourself. Being a civil engineer or a lawyer isn‚Äôt something that requires some great generational wealth.  Seems to me like a bunch of excuses to explain their astronomical success. Sundar pichai is the CEO of one of largest companies in the world and is one of this highest compensated as well. He comes from a middle class family in India or a roughly a lower class in the US. Focus on your merit and complain about nepotism later. Immigrants from impoverished countries in Asia dominate almost all high paying jobs in the country. Work your ass off and give your kids those same opportunities, the reality is you won‚Äôt and you‚Äôll just sulk your whole life blaming others for your lack of skill and merit.

POV: You got lucky this semester and don‚Äôt have any Thursday classes. The newfound chill in the autumn air has you feeling some type of way tonight. You ask your stoner friend to smoke you up but they already have plans so they invite you along. You think, okay, it‚Äôs college, why the hell not. You end up at a neckbeard‚Äôs lair inundated with the smell of dog balls, litter box, and microwaveable meals. There‚Äôs an iguana staring at you from a terrarium in the far corner. You‚Äôre far too stoned on scary sativa and you can‚Äôt decide if the iguana is real or not. Out of nowhere, the neckbeard asks if you‚Äôve ever seen Office Space. A part of you dies and you sit there couch-locked throughout the entire movie desperately needing to fart. You walk back to campus and die of laughter the entire way home. God laughs with you.

Wasn‚Äôt there a huge wave of dad bod hype for a while a couple years back, did that pan out well
Bezos only worked McDonalds at 16 as a summer job before he went to Princeton, his dad had civil engineer money and bankrolled him $300k for Amazon

Gates' dad was a prominent Seattle lawyer, paid for Bill Gates $40k/yr private high school where he learned computers

Buffett's dad had a real estate side hustle and Buffett got in on it as a teenager, making $100k by his late teens

Obama's grandmother was VP of the Bank of Hawaii, and most likely coached him through prep school all the way to Harvard

Don't be fooled by hopium dreams. Exponential success is generational, if your family ain't got it, you better stop entertaining low-probability odds and get down to brass tacks

Seriously, if your only source is BI, you need to actually put the last few cents of your YOLO money into subscribing FT/Bloomberg/WSJ/Nikkei/Caixin before you run your mouth off.

Also, you really pretending this Evergrande thing is still news? Check spot USD/CNY. If you think you‚Äôre smarter than those actually working in FICC, you should try to make a guess appearance on Bloomberg TV before playing prognosticator on Reddit.

But since you can‚Äôt even muster the guts/have the resources to put your money where your mouth is, my hope placed on you isn‚Äôt very high.

Yes, unfortunately Webull is really that slow. It's honestly the only advantage RH has over them. I use Webull to check and go over market conditions and technicals. Where I find that they are a bit quicker over RH for pruce updates. This does help in picking strikes and inputting option pricing on RH which I use as a swing trader/scalper while at work. If I wanted to do daytrade I would go with etrade/td or so.ething else though.

Fun fact: The coronal ridge, is the ridge around your penis head, it‚Äôs what makes it look like a mushroom‚Ä¶.. Well, the reason male humans have that is to scoop out other males sperm. With each thrust the males gathers semen in that ridge and is then pulled back as the male pulls back‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ This is also why the penis becomes so sensitive immediately after orgasam, so the male won‚Äôt thrust any further into the female and possibly scoop out his own sperm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

Webull users can you throw some personal experience my way 

I opened a Webull acc and deposited 3k on this past Tuesday, planned on using for an earnings play next week(Wednesday). They gave me 2k ‚Äúbuying power‚Äù right after I did it but the transfers say ‚Äúestimated 10/26‚Äù aka NEXT Tuesday before settled. Do bank ‚ÄúACH‚Äù  transfers usually take the full 5 business days to settle? I want to use the 3k on options but you can‚Äôt use the 2k credit they give you to trade options apparently. Thanks. 

Btw I also submitted a ‚Äúchange account to cash‚Äù from margin on Tuesday when I deposited. Which they also claim takes a week. Is Webull really this slow or has anyone had experience with them finishing before the date the tell you?

Who‚Äôs buying Donald Trump spac tomorrow lmao
XP you right, she don‚Äôt know shit
Here are my thoughts on ydays news:

1. I think pypl buying pins is retarded and risky, I don't see how it would provide any synergies/cost advantages to their core business. Therefore, I can see why the stock sold off.

2. I do think at this point it's news, so may have been an overreaction. 

3. I don't think this sale will actually happen, but I suppose it is possible. 

4. If they deny it the stock will likely shoot right back up, but in the near term I'm playing technicals on this trade. I will gladly enter today if it retests the low $250s on next week's $275.50/$260 calls.
That's dumb. But ok.

Bloomberg breaks so many news stories you could easily insider trade if you were in charge of pushing the go-live button. Just buy exactly 1 second after publishing and before the CDNs catch up
I just put $100 in Shiba, because why not
So if PYPL denies the rumor, would you believe in your TA more or less then?
I just want to take 2k and make it into 2 million. Honestly, not asking for a lot. Like bare minimum
Yes, definitely ask her if she wants a massage
China is fukd.
Not sure if you‚Äôre really unfamiliar with spreads but you ought to learn about them if you haven‚Äôt already.
It is def propped up tho, ghost towns are everywhere
Based on it not closing above the 200ma price level and a likely continuation off ydays big bearish candle. I think it can retest low $250s one more time. Was gonna enter y'day, but wanted to see how it reacts today...

If you run numbers typically it makes more sense to do 45-60 dte short puts, close as theta accelerates and wastes away half or whatever, then re open in ~30 days for the next batch and so on, so every 30 days you buy to close and have profit.  


You‚Äôll also gain the power of compounding, allowing for each subsequent months play to be larger. 


You do have to go closer to market price to gain decent premium though. The 110 June isn‚Äôt actually too bad at all given how far OTM. You‚Äôd just do the math for the shorter ones and see if you can come out ahead that way. It needs to be by quite a bit since you‚Äôll be taking on more risk being closer to the market price. 


.2-.3 delta.
You make decent points, though I would say that it‚Äôs probably better to sell call credit spreads if you‚Äôre bearish since you‚Äôll benefit from IV crush rather than suffer from it. Worth considering surely.

I think I want to buy **SBUX** puts, maybe before earnings (10/29).  
  
I don't know when it will reflect in the valuation (and would appreciate input), but there are a few things lately tickling me about the company. They're pushing heavily into the Chinese market (12% of total stores now) - i.e. spending money on expansion, which in the long term can be nice, *but*:  
  
I live in a suburban hub in the NE, and when I pull up the Starbucks app, the six closest stores to me aren't allowing for orders ahead for pickup at any point during normal store hours.  
  
"Oh, maybe they're just so busy they can't handle the volume" you might think, and typically, I'd think that's true - the stores in question make thousands a day in my area, absolute shitshow levels of busy, a constant stream of customers in and out.  
  
But no. I drive there and the store is closed outright. I drive to the next one over...closed. I'm doing errands a bit away from the neighborhood, and finally one's open, err, well, *was* open, according to the paper sign taped to the door, til 2pm.  
  
Asking around, they simply don't have the staff to open.   
Now, I thought Starbucks offered a pretty solid benefits package, I'm pretty sure even part-time workers get insurance and such. But talking to baristas I know, the hourly wages tend to be dogshit, and I suppose maybe people just aren't tipping very well lately.  
  
Either way, if this is a trend in other areas, the stores in question are either missing out on thousands in profit daily per store, or they might have to start spending more for higher wages for staff to keep them on. And training new staff to make your shocking venti iced matcha with whipped cream and a doubleshot of espresso is costly, and service sucks when shorthanded.
  
 Either way, SBUX is gonna be taking a hit to the pocketbook, especially as customers end up disappointed frequently enough to not even check if the stores are open pre-commute.  
  
Now multiply this with supply chain shortages and the increasing cost across the board of paper products, other disposables, and coffee. Plus, while milk price is regulated, soy/oat/almond milks are all more popular than ever and the fed only cares if it comes from Ol' Bessie's nipples.  
  
I do need to clarify if you read all this, that I'm an absolute fucking retard.

Interesting. Why do they hate it? Very curious. I really love it.

I used to work at a big firm - their project tools sucked. All internally developed crap. Now I work at smaller manufacturer (150 employees, 200m) - their project tools suck. Horrible internal developed stuff or just non-existent.

It's been a great for running a team of 8 people full remote and managing projects - My monthly close for recurring tasks, etc. (run accounting dept).

I don't think most of yall understand how inflation works. If inflation is say 5% this year and then 2% next year, that doesn't mean things are going to be less expensive. No, it just means that next year it it will cost more but at less of an increase. So 1 becomes 1.05 becomes 1.071.

I did this. Bought a house 64k pre Covid. Two years later (3 months ago) sold it for $135k bought a duplex that costs $1205 a month. Renting one side for $1200 living in the other. Buying another across the street next year same rent same cost

If I have calls on PINS at 80 and it gets sold to PayPal at 70, what happens?
Explain to me: how is selling June 17's 110p of BABA puts for 3.8-3.95 worth of credit is not free money?
Well the drop in iv alone will not be pleasant, let alone the drop in price. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see Tesla just rally off of this all day tomorrow though. And with 11/19 exp, you got tons of time.
I ordered a bunch of stuff that's being sent by FedEx and those mofos won't deliver my shit until after their earnings. I dunno how to interpret this, should I buy calls or puts on FDX?
Compare to a Tesla Model S for the same price

Inflation is real. There‚Äôs no doubt about that. We need to see what the world looks like once supply chains are fixed though and we are a ways off from that. Literally everyone guessing whether it‚Äôs transitory or not is a monkey including the banks. The current inflation is probably here to stay the real question is whether it continues longer than a year or two.
If you are driving a Nissan GTR you are a fuckin idiot. Three months to fix a part.

Check all the Fed charts related to retail sales, personal income, consumer credit etc. It's pretty obvious that consumer spending will decline quite bigly within the next few months.

Many people paid off their debts with stimulus, but the debt levels are rising again. Most retail sales right now appear to be driven by increasing debt.

If wages keep rising rapidly, inflation could cover the drop in spending though. Depends how prolonged this all is.

But pretty confident within a quarter or two we will see declining earnings for most companies. Big tech likely outgrows the decline though
I know. I'm just coping with my coming ban
They can make it 8D for all I care.

Still ain‚Äôt got no rights
VMod is easily the best thing that has ever happened to me
If tomorrow is even slightly red all the headlines will be about the 10 year and how inflation is real again after neither mattered for the past six days.
This sub is so completely underestimated. Of course there‚Äôs a fuck ton of retards, but there‚Äôs plenty of average Joe‚Äôs who somehow seem more sophisticated in their understanding of financials, leverage and investment thesis than the absolute morons who are supposedly hedge fund managers that they bring on CNBC. No wonder the wealthy seem scared shitless. They‚Äôre all fucking lazy and see us having the upper hand. School apparently did fuck all for these financial institution managers.

I would love to see SPY have a correction. Although even with all the bad news lately I don‚Äôt think we will see it the way everybody is anticipating. It‚Äôs going to be a long drawn out decline with decreased earnings every quarter &amp; investors realizing growth is immensely slowed + less &amp; less QE that will get us there.  The slowest rug pull you can imagine

Just saw an ad for Judge Judy‚Äôs new show and it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúJudy Justice‚Äù. They gave her a new look and a purple robe and she‚Äôs not a bitch anymore. Look at how far we‚Äôve fallen.
Idk why it is always the people that have no idea what they are talking about that want to be the loudest about their opinions lol

There‚Äôs this concept called a ‚Äúbid ask spread‚Äù where the cost to get into a position can be dramatically different than the cost to get out. When that spread is wide, it can make it difficult to profitably trade a position. Why don‚Äôt you take another look at that chain and see if you can find a put credit spread that has a bid ask spread of less than 20-30% of the position itself. I‚Äôll save you some time and tell you most are actually more than that. What this means is you are essentially handicapped by 20-30% before the position is even established.

Now go take a look at some of the other large cap tech options chains that you referenced. Take a peek and Microsoft or Apple for instance, the two largest cap tech companies out there. You see how the bid ask spreads are much tighter when you try to get into credit/debit spreads there? That is why higher-priced more volatile stocks like Tesla are a different animal to trade.

Profit scales with position? No shit? So like all options? Thanks for telling me "things I will learn"...

The entire point of credit spreads is to hit max profit by having both legs expire otm...You sound like the morons on facebook "go do your own research" without actually explaining yourself. 

I have looked at the option chain. The width of the spread is the width of the spread...it would have the same collateral requirements no matter what ticker you trade...5 wide is 5 wide etc.

 TSLA is not really any different than other large cap tech option chains. Plenty of liquidity. Plenty of premium due to historic volatility. Prime target for weekly credit spreads.

Nord Stream 2 flows put the EU reliant on Russia for natty gas for the majority of their energy needs. They can shut it off at any time. What if the USA goes to war with Russia? Who‚Äôs gonna back the USA? Think about the issues this presents. Wars are over natural resources no matter what the text book tells you. See Iraq. They have the 5th largest oil reserve in the world. That‚Äôs why we invaded. This is a chess game that‚Äôs very complicated. Trump put sanctions on anyone involved with Nord Stream 2. Biden lifted them and the pipeline was completed last month. Russia straight up told the EU that they will not get any more supply of natty gas without approval. If approved, they bend the knee. It‚Äôs fucking over.

I‚Äôm telling you things you will learn once you actually trade it. First of all your profit scales with the position so you are making much less while still tying up a relatively large amount of capital short credit spreads. And all you have to do to figure out why I said good luck on Tesla spreads is to literally just look at the option chain. Trading Tesla is absolutely different than other stocks

Made profit of by a thousand but I spent at least 50 to 80k also, it‚Äôs takes a big amount of money to make a good money and I‚Äôm risking all the time and lately about over a month now I keep losing by a thousand also, and I haven‚Äôt get back yet because market is stink lately, I spent 65k in Tesla today and yet it‚Äôs stink
that was more funny to me than it should have been
Bro you literally took my comment WTF!
I mean maybe it‚Äôs time to atleast take profits and see rather than back up the truck and load up on calls after this parabolic rise
What you got to sell?
Yep. But 2 boxes...24 in each

It's fun to trade SPY zero or two day's. Anyone arguing with you probably had the opposite position last week, or will in a few days.

Lately SPY has been gapping up overnight and not really moving intraday. You'll lose more to theta decay than you will make from gamma unless there's a big move. Maybe aim for doubling or tripling your initial on a 0dte

Functionally it is? You‚Äôre selling and buying them. You limit your upside but it‚Äôs still a bullish position. You‚Äôre not really putting up that much in collateral but depends on the width of the spread
Yupppp. Heavy smoker for five years and quit for a month to be able to enjoy a vacation. Came back, ripped a phatttt bowl, and got all tweaky and didnt enjoy it. Havent smoked since, which is good for my wallet but i miss being constantly stoned. Weird connundrum to have but i feel ya man

Holy fuck that Knicks game was unreal

They‚Äôll bag hold forever. They will never get what they want. 

The truth is there is a huge industry taking advantage of them in the options market
Whats next friday?
Why?  It‚Äôs a great car IMO
Oh and to your other question, a ‚Äú10 bagger‚Äù is an investment which grows 10x - it‚Äôs a rare and awesome thing
They is.

It‚Äôs mooning tomorrow. Paper hands sold. Record revenue/profits.
Yes you are late, I too was referring to the price. The goal is to buy low and sell high my man
But I‚Äôm smooth brain! Please elaborattt!
Good
That's beautiful
Cant wait to see what CSX opens at tomorrow, hoping for 100% gains
 But is it thot out
As a stud, I can confirm
I would buy Tesla stock but never a Tesla
Oh well. Cheers to good times with this one though :)
ASAN is just getting started. It‚Äôs gonna cross 200 with in 3 months
Prolly same amount that have 800p

At what point will the GME tards stop polluting every investment sub ? How many years will they bag hold before they give up, almost been a year and they‚Äôre still here.
Yeah love casually selling Tesla puts to make $500 while tying up almost 100k in capital
America doen‚Äôt care about it‚Äôs people, it only cares about $$$$
I have 10/29 23s. Up almost 40% so far from early this week. Steel dynamics action from Monday made me a bit worried though
SPY has to go up like 15% for a 0dte 10 bagger üòÇ
Anyone else get irritated my GME posts?
Downvoted for overvalued ASAN, upvoted for TLRY
900p are about to b delicious
that's what I'm trying to wrap my head around, I guess it could go higher and they could try to negotiate a higher buyout price

Shit, that cuts deep.

Ha! I myself was a GME winner, for awhile.

I would
The lack of comments on CLF give me hope for my earnings play. Easy 5 bagger I'd say
Something tells me you played GME to do that
Lol the name sounds like some "independent journalism" blog full of nonsense
I wish we could just choose to sleep for 3 days straight and not have to sleep for the rest of the week.

I will hold. Only bear case is now if the deal doesn't work out. Otherwise I don't see PINS dropping. If the deal was done then PINS would have already be at 70$.

Copy these and sell at $460 for SPY and wait for a small pullback near EOD and buy longer calls. Will probably get downvoted af but I am correct.
but the fucking *coral reefs* dude. They are so pretty and they turn into bleached bones covered in green slime infested with nothing but jellyfish.
not a lot just shit choices. A SPY put and a lot of Tesla calls. Gonna get ass raped by both tomorrow

Just a heads up everyone, overall market crash coming soon, Monday, 10/25 should see at least a 3-4% drop, be careful holding stuff over the weekend.

I wrote up a DD called "we're all fucked" about it, but mods won't let it post, it's pinned to my profile if you want to read it.  Otherwise just be careful, markets generally go vertical just before a crash, and SPY is up 4.6% in the last couple of days.

A pull back to 445 would be completely justifiable by end of week
Now thats more like it!
VCLT has higher yield than VCIT (since it's long term bonds), I think you probably mean VCSH which is shorter term and lower yield? 

FWIW, I've used both VCSH and VCLT in the past (mostly as a hedge, to book paper losses in my home currency when it strengthens against USD).
Damn futes ain't looking swell.  Lowering my SPY price target from 500 to 200.  200p gang wya

please go on and tell us why SPY will hit 200 before December

EDIT: At the same time Im a poor who's apt smells like cigs so what do i even know
That means it's a nothingburger because the market doesn't do what people expect. I hope.

LOL that‚Äôs even more incorrect buddy. Jeez. That‚Äôs sad. Who‚Äôs your bank? You do realize the seller credit and lender credit can only go towards the closing costs, right. It never goes towards the purchase price. If the closing costs are $8k and the seller credit is $9k well that‚Äôs your agents fault because you just lost $1k. You‚Äôre not able to get a seller credit that exceeds the actual closing costs.

The seller credits I am receiving are greater than my closing costs, so some of the credit must go towards the purchase price. The seller has agreed to allow me to choose the purchase price and amount of credit. I know what I am talking about.
This isn‚Äôt a political statement. 

TWTR lost an insane market share, which is why they **dropped 25%** upon announcing they Banned him, and then **another 25%** when their earnings came out and it was revealed that around 75% of their page views from prior earnings were Trump links people would send each other.

If this reclaims that market, then it‚Äôs valuation would be *fucking massive.*

Boeing (BA) calls traded with unusually high volume for Oct 22 over open interest for 217.5$, 220$, and 222.5$ calls. Noteworthy is that 91% of the puts traded today were dumped at bid or below bid price, meaning the sellers of those put are hopping they will be worthless by Friday. 

My retarded brain guess is someone knows something and it's due for a big pop. Couldn't resist and got a few lotto tickets for BA expiring in 2 days.

Sometimes it feels bad but having profit targets to average out of positions is hugely important. Secure gains on the way up because you never know what the top is. Obviously this is more important for contracts that expire relatively soon unlike LEAPS and shares.

Normally I like to ride these periods out in corporate bonds.   They were too expensive to buy back in September, but the price looks better and better each day.
I made good money on BBVA back when it was still allowed on HOOD. Credit Suisse wasn't bad either if I recall. It definitely sucked having to pay double taxes though.
During the last five trading days, volume in put options has lagged volume in call options by 58.40% as investors make bullish bets in their portfolios. However, this among the lowest levels of put buying seen during the last two years, indicating greed on the part of investors.

Has anyone been holding TQQQ? Curious if you hold long term through ups and downs or do you try and sell high and rebuy the dips.
looks like a butthole to me
is COIN a good long term hold?
I think it‚Äôs whatever you want it to be (and yes I see it)
That is flair. Could be a grey ass hole if you want to pretend
Seems a bit scary you can't interpret the fundamental moves both equities have made over past 8 weeks, and that NFLX for example was up almost 30$ bn on previous ER based, in widespread commentary, on a sub-$1 bn value single cult tv property. TSLA ran up with the energy-commodity drive, that seems pretty clear, and fundamentally that's not tied to their present earnings. 10YR also relatively high .. TSLA in 850s is over-reaching.
Partnered w/ Shopify recently (today), podcasts, expanding ad revenue resources;  possibly looking profitable. 

They usually dump after ER regardless, so I'll wait and feel it out.

But LEAPS are probably the move, expected growth in next few years is big.

compared to these glorified payday loan companies everyone loves, yes.
It‚Äôs not really falling, it‚Äôs slightly down from all time high. This earnings call was actually great news doe long term holders  You gotta remember options are basically gambles. Long term share holders like myself don‚Äôt consider this a drop at all.

It's insane.  Costco had NY Strip $13.99 a pound and it was choice..
What?
price too high. Speculation: long term holders/whales will let ppl run the price up, then when there's a good time to take profits it's rug pull time.
You should not have done that.

As a dude that works for the largest manufacturer in the world it‚Äôs larger and bigger than just EVs. We tend to think very US centric. Some parts of the world don‚Äôt even have electricity. It has to be a hybrid model with fuel cell and hydrogen or X.

they make money from wild volatility
you sound like me 4 months ago LOL
It depends where the money goes and where it comes from.  Right now income is rising most in the lower brackets because of demand for labor and most of the money printer programs more heavily benefitted the lower class.  Median household savings increased a lot and if you live paycheck to paycheck and you got more than a 5% raise you are doing better.   

I guess I didn't factor in that stocks rocketed way more than inflation though

They are a well run company no question. My only concern is the way medical billing works is that the problems that were seen in august and September may not be reflected in this quarters revenue.  But I would think that at the very least they are going to have to adjust guidance for rest of 2021.  But it‚Äôs a risky play. I‚Äôm putting about $10k in puts for 10/29

Because they have been having a solid run through the quarter and their earnings have been holding up. But I'm guessing those issues could hinder this ER
I remember thinking we were due for a heavy correction in 2011 and 2012 because I thought the fundamentals were fucked and nothing that happened in 2008-09 had corrected anything.

My trading career

Phase 1. Buy calls middle of the day on SPY after a jump, get theta raped and sell at open for a 60% loss.

Phase 2: Prescribed adderall, learned TA and trading terms. But hyper focused on averaging down too much when the contract wouldn‚Äôt hit.

Now: Keep up to date on the news/current events. Only buy deep OTM contracts where I know they will gain value closer to exp. Mastered TA to not get theta raped &amp; only bet with America.

Phase 4: Out of the Rabbit hole by EOW and don‚Äôt be autistic anymore (I‚Äôll upload my YTD).

Bers are just clowns living in echo chambers. They think that by religiously repeating every single day psalms like "mArKeT cRaSh Is CoMiNg", "mArKeTs ArE rIgGeD", "iNfLaTiOn", "bUbBlE", that eventually a crash will happen. They're delusional clowns and got *"fake it till you make it"* completely wrong.

Sell before earnings and buy shares going into earnings
Not a bad play. What happens if they accept
I'd post it to /r/investing/ but they'd all be like "wtf that's not buy and hold, mods plz ban"
I‚Äôm in.
Haha, wait for it.
I hope so, so far disappointed by the AH price action, expected at least a 15$ pop
It's marketed and priced as a top-tier vodka in most of the world. I have no problem with it.
No, earnings results that happen after hours don't get priced into options during market hours. The future catalyst provides value to the contract. Now that the catalyst is over, the value of it is going to disappear from the options tomorrow morning.
It's really weird that earnings on all these major us companies are üî•.  I swear the in depth market analysis I kept hearing for the past two months was that the economy was in shambles and the SPY was going to drop below 420 soon for sure. 

The technical analysis nerds were talking about this being a serious downtrend too.  I don't understand.  It's almost like people spent hours researching and educating themselves on the market and predicted the exact opposite of reality with confidence. ü§î

5% was an overreaction if it was based on the weekend "sick out". Airlines weasel their way out of losing money for canceled flights all the time. Sure, it's a bad mark against them for future bookings, but the other airlines are going to be overbooked real soon if they aren't already, as we're entering the busy season. I can't speak much to the variant or what Israel is doing, but Americans are tired of this shit which is why there was a sick out in the first place, and it's not the only sector that is impacted. These are specialized jobs with inelastic labor supply due to training requirements. Companies are going to lose money if they don't use their lobbying influence to curtail this shit soon, and they will. We might go back to square one, but this is how I see it playing out short term.

The reopening trade is on very uneven footing imo, between oil going up and 2k flights for the weekend in question, how is their q4 guidance not hurt my guy? Plus, we have a new covid variant rising out of the UK and vaccine efficacy is deteriorating by the day. Look at the Israeli data from there most recent surge. You now are considered unvaxxed if you have less than 3 shots of Pfizer in Isreal.

You actually thought I was drinking and driving??? I only do that on Friday nights, it gets fun avoiding the DUI checkpoints.

Super basic answer is Because it is costing PayPal a lot of money.
Vehicles are listed as a fixed asset on the balance sheet so checkmate
Thanks buddy. Watching the movie midsommar
Not that I‚Äôve ever seen
Agree in general but my 2007 Toyota is worth $2000 more than what I paid for it last September... and that's with a year of driving. Stupid sexy used car market

Think about it from a value perspective.  Paypal has now lost x amount of money either in cash or assets, and pinterest has now gained that same x amount of money in cash or assets.  Of course the value of a company going down or up will cause that company's stock price to rise or fall in accordance.
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/winkydinkvw** bet **MTN** goes from **345.82** to **270.0** before **2021-12-15 18:44:27.000130-04:00** **or i‚Äôll post a picture of my dog named after a cheese**
Sounds solid. I didn't think the Jan 30 had a chance, but seeing as it is pushing up with little news, anything big just might get it there. Earnings and bank charter news will probably make or break it.
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/Big-Stein** bet **JOE** goes from **45.8** to **51.5** before **2021-11-10 18:44:20.382956-04:00**

Pay sure that would be a wash sale
How low you think it will dump?
So I'm a newbie. But what's the reason paypal dropped so much while pinterest rised after acquisition? Is it always the buyer is gonna drop after a buy?
Awesome thanks for the info! So stay tuned Monday? $1000C end Nov LFG

Yup

Does PayPal's late state talks mean like they are on their 3rd trimester and about to pop?
Very good scientific breakdown.
Short term gains - short term losses = x

Long term gains - long term losses = y

Taxes = x+y

For one calendar year. Also watch out for the wash sale rule and re entering a risky trade.

Let‚Äôs say you day trade and make 100k that year. It‚Äôs possible to then lose 100k gains on a shit trade Dec 30. Re enter the same company in the new year on the 2nd of Jan. You‚Äôre now disallowed to claim the loss and are subject to those taxes
Ik, it‚Äôs comical. Sub will be wiped tomorrow.

It's just chop. There's a wide af channel from 170 to about 180 since September 21st. Looks like consolidation along the bottom is happening right now, but a breakout could be in either direction since the volume is pretty stable.

Make sure you buy 2dte or less way OTM call options on a stock prior to earnings, you wouldn't want to miss out on 100% gains because IV will only go higher

All gains and losses are added and deducted for your total gain/loss. So no you won't have to pay taxes on it if you sold for a loss before the end of the year.
Say something inspirational again. u/cashflow_

You will just be taxed if you have net capital gains. If you have a net loss you won‚Äôt pay taxes because you realized the loss. The exception is wash sales.

Cool thanks
the idea that buying a put spread on a gamma squeezing piece of garbage around ATHs as it runs up to earnings that it always crashes after is somehow brave is not something I'd agree with but I'll accept the compliment
Lmfao I meant puts
It played out already. It dropped like 5%. I don't think it'll go much farther and despite them having issues over a *single* weekend, I doubt their bottom line is hurt enough to impact earnings.

If your wife/gf asks if she looks "fat in this" tell her "yes", she will respect your honesty and love you that much more
True
For TSLA?
because im not rich enough to do that. you realize you need 300M at least to set up a proper Hedge fund to pay for all these legal fees as operating expense.
No lol but she is going to be pissed when I get a sailboat regardless of what car I buy lmao

Puts on LUV. Irrespective of what you think is the right or wrong position of firms to mandate covid19 vaccines. There is bullshit afoot, other carriers didnt need to cancel flights due to poor weather that weekend. Yet, someone how the weather gods only targeted southwest airlines?  

Either pilots were indeed not showing up or the airline is poorly mismanaged or both. The capitulation of management in announcing they would not be putting unvaccinated employees on unpaid leave and are just getting all the unvaccinated employees to file for exemptions says it all.

My story begins in nineteen-dickety-two. We had to say dickety because the Kaiser had stolen our word twenty. I chased that rascal to get it back, but gave up after dickety-six miles. Then after World War Two, it got kinda quiet, 'til Superman challenged FDR to a race around the world. FDR beat him by a furlong, or so the comic books would have you believe. The truth lies somewhere in between. Three wars back we called Sauerkraut "liberty cabbage" and we called liberty cabbage "super slaw" and back then a suitcase was known as a "Swedish lunchbox." We can't bust heads like we used to, but we have our ways. One trick is to tell 'em stories that don't go anywhere - like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. Give me five bees for a quarter, you'd say. Ah, there's an interesting story behind that nickel. In 1957, I remember it was, I got up in the morning and made myself a piece of toast. I set the toaster to three: medium brown.Now where were we? Oh yeah: the important thing was I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones... - Joe Biden
Bullish on ChargePoint for the next 3 months. Looking at the chart it looks like its bottomed out around 18$ and is sitting at 21$ right now with a high of 49.48$ to start this year off. I can see this hitting 30$ easily in next few months for 50% profits. Options anyone? Ticker is CHPT

Options or just swing trading?
Exactly. Dump after earnings, which is why I am worried if there‚Äôs no run up. 

I‚Äôm probably exiting my position before earnings. If there‚Äôs not a huge run up, I‚Äôll hold after earnings I guess. It really depends on the price action

Most of us involved in hiring are pretty desperate tbh.  But yeah I would be pretty tempted to tell 1000 people to go away if I had a company as successful as Netflix with top of market pay rates to offer to others.
Yeah, that 4,000 volume on the 5 minute after market close is totally killing the puts or calls that we can't sell anyway
Nah, I wish sometimes. In home sales consultant.
It‚Äôll happen, use em on star link
Of course I have puts. But that has nothing to do with it. The run after covid was already unbelievable, where it got pumped to a higher valuation than before all of the stress that covid caused. The dip of 5%, not even a correction, seemed to put some sanity back into this market, but we're back to rampant speculation totally disconnected from all economic reality.
This is not very fun when you shifting your ratio from 90% retarded gambling to 10% retarded gambling

Just a weird fill probably
it's very simple. just make sure you have 25k to day trade, follow trends on ur day chart, use the basic indicators, sell when up a few percentages, and never get greedy. I pull in about 3k-5k a week.

True but this time is different than the other runs ups. The volume was crazy high for BB yesterday. Chen has stated the high probability of patent sale to being finalized by end of this quarter. We broke up out of that wedge and closed pretty strong yesterday. BB ran without the other meme stocks running. So all the signs pointing to someone knows some inside news. Guess we‚Äôll find out

This TSLA earnings call sounds bearish as fuck
That‚Äôs a wide spread?
You got a fav ski spot?
Not really, if it stays flat, call owners (except those having bought FDs) win as with this massive beat price target raises will follow as usual and pump the stock even more. And even if the stock dips a bit, the dip should quickly disappear.
Yeah bitches

Sorry I read that wrong lol.
I can't wait for the collective Pikachu face when TSLA opens at $900 tomorrow.

Well it‚Äôs going to gain 15% over the next two months so who cares if it drops 10%
You‚Äôre in the right stock, earnings is coming up. MRNA and BNTX are both sleeping giants that are waking up very very soon (not financial help)

if SPY drops 10% next week how shocked will you really be? and be honest...  
in hindsight even the bulls will say yeah we were pretty bloated for no good reason...
I approve of this analysis.
Which reminds me they work with Amazon competitors like shopify

How do I not have those skills if I have to use them, albeit very very basic, but I kind of understand some code even though i dont get into high level. But yeah ill try harder. Anything I can do to up my skills?
whats your move for weeklys tomorrow?
I'm just looking at my losses in calls.. should be worse tomorrow..
those margins won't last as tougher competition enters and their product becomes more commoditized.  they don't even make their own batteries

Bag holding pltr for the second time.
if it's flat now, it's red tomorrow.  a lot of people bought looking for some action, and when they don't get it, they sell
$TSLA forward PE ratio is 126. Gross margins of 28.8% EXCLUDING credits is unheard of for a ‚Äúcar‚Äù company. I have never been heavier in it, bought a share AH just because. Have another AH limit order for 10 more at $850 and if this is red somehow tomorrow, I will back the bus up again and somehow find room for even more.
Yes run to 460, pull back and end at 465. Makes sense üôÑ

Yeah, say whatever you want about the stock being overvalued, but they killed those earnings numbers.
I did that all throughout 2020 but with stripclubs
If its less than 100% I couldn't care less
God, I feel sick to my stomach. I chickened out of a position because it was collapsing, and closed for like a 4% gain. That same position then skyrocketed upwards, which would have given me a 35% return.
Good, I kinda figured he would have died.

Even if Theta gang wins tomorrow on TSLA; look at the chart.  Just looks set to at the very least touch all time highs with all the momentum behind it.

Tomorrow might actually be a decent day to buy TSLA calls after vol wears off a bit.

I'd be surprised if we don't see TSLA over $900 sometime in the next couple of weeks.  Just such strong price action there past month or two.  This earnings was already expected to be gangbusters, just let the action settle a bit.
Lol

Tesla beat EPS by 17% and revenue by 0.95%. That's not enough to move the needle especially after such a steep climb before the report.

By 2024 I'm gonna be up to 24,242.42 shares of pltr with a cost average of $24.24 and I'm gonna sell them all for the going market price at that time, which i expect to be somewhere in the vicinity of $24.24. This is all so that I can further increase my holdings by buying it all back on a dip at 23.25 after a favorable PR and waiting for the day I see at least $24 again, which I think will be soon thereafter
Is IBM still around? wtf do they make?
Just no way right now with the supply chains getting fucked, this will be their highest EPS for another 6mo to a year.
Man that sounds rough. You can do better then that

lol a month long search with a fine toothed comb by the FBI: nothing

15 minutes after they open the park and his parents start looking for him: hey guys over here

Volume low but everyone is buying YETI cups and coolers. I just got a roadie and it's sweet. 

Their profit margin is insanely high so if they needed to reduce costs they easily can. This is another restoration hardware where the rich don't give a crap about price they just want the apple of outdoors.

You‚Äôll care about the dead pretty white girl and you‚Äôll like it.

Nah it was an experiment. Tesla always changes direction when I buy an option so I decided to see what would happen if I bet both ways. Clearly hasn't gone well
Yes, why not since the cuck is changing it to malware or something
Tesla has always been known for cutting corners, nothing new there.
Post losses too!
I doubt they're announcing a Nuclear powered vehicle.

Elon repurposing chips into auto chips is insane. Recipe for disaster long term. Wont be buying a Tesla any time soon lol

you're fine as long as you dont live in NYC or SF
JFC I made $800 off of $400 worth of spy calls yesterday. This was literally painful to read.
I used to say this a lot at work because IBM makes and sells shit

Nothing has changed since.
Im sorry, that's 7% in 24 hours, not a year. ü§£
It‚Äôs downgraded
Like everyday I will buy BA and some calls, will make or break. Something big coming for it like China re-certifying the planes again. Otherwise there would be no reason to see almost 25000 contracts traded for 220$ calls for Oct 22.
Jeez. That's deep ITM, you probably won't make or lose anything lol
What if TEsla announces a small car
It‚Äôs Tesla isn‚Äôt it

The Stress Market
It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt matter what the value of TSLA is what matters is that after earnings a bunch of speculators who came to gamble will leave and the stock will drop.

It gets worrying when you‚Äôre 28-30 years old and still making 45-50k a year in the tech scene and shitty savings no girl. I swear yesterday I was like 21. Shit creeps up fast.

I‚Äôm mostly surprised that equities are performing well in a big inflationary environment, my finance professor would be kicking and screaming
Well, I got a phone call out of the blue telling me that the company I work for voted to liquidate last night. Awesome news

you know you can sell to open options, right?

I didn't but that would have made sense. Probably just my brain's way of calling me out on the quality of my options plays
Fuck you lmao the m2 is the ultimate driving machine

Yeah. I barely play anything but spy now. 

Easier than individual stonks imo
Any other financially trained and licensed peeps in here that have watched this last 18 months with shock and awe?
Or be a girl
You were first. I‚Äôll give you that. Me deleting my comment, never happened and won‚Äôt happen. Say it with your chest!
I just need SOFI to keep creeping till Friday, let me make the right call for once.
I'm getting at something deeper here. Not just tolerance for risk but a complete neglect for it. And a complete neglect for anything rational. Like if an infant could understand and speak.
It's called iv
Yes iV
I did that, then realized it was more profitable to play everything else.

lol

I'll probably only play SPY if there are no good earnings to mess with.
If fundamentals don‚Äôt matter, then earnings don‚Äôt either‚Ä¶
It's not like they'll help with cost-push inflation anyway.
Tesla AH is a perfect example of why I don‚Äôt fuck with options during earnings. Calls and outs will both get fucked IMO

Wtf are you guys talking about. TSLA looks fine and is climbing.

Edit:  your all idiots. When has anyone profited betting against TSLA.
Stock prices go up, stock prices go down, can't explain that!
AI lending platform. Has generated big returns over the last year but is down almost 10% since last week.
ya just priced way too high. he would have had to pull of something miraculous to pump the stock at this point.
because I need some confirmation bias
I still remember that day. I had some FD puts and sold literally 5 mins before he tweeted that.

That bro is some grade a troll
SPY is the most liquid thing out there with expiration 3 times per week you dont need anything else.
Every option going to get pounded.
They need to show a list of people banned and how long they are banned for so we can see the extent of the culling.
theta gang thanks tsla option buyers

Definitely calls on the dip. Puts on Tesla are never a good idea.
Damn tesla killed it. too bad the stock is so overpriced so now it's gonna fall.
Let‚Äôs hear the bear case for tomorrow why do you believe it‚Äôs going down?

puts but with Jan 2023 expiry
Had a dream last night that I looked at my portfolio and there was a stock whose ticker was PISS. Apparently I'd placed an options order a long time ago but it had no expiration date, and finally the ask price got so low that it filled. So I was holding several calls on PISS
Elon needs to tweet "the stock is too damn high" again soon or my Nov 990C are done for

how to not get fucked by earnings: look at the graph of the quarter. is it up a lot? dont fucking buy calls then

THAT'S FUCKING INSANE THOUGH.  plus it'd go past ath... not that that's weird anymore
Maybe tomorrow. Earnings aren‚Äôt good enough for a surge especially with it as high as it is right now so my guess(guess being key word as I know nothing about nothing) is that it slides on a sell off.
Guh

Lol you got to learn somehow I guess haha. Usually with earnings releases, they drop the numbers first ahead of the scheduled press conference. The shareholder deck is the important info that they then go over in the 5:30 call later
3 days for a 2% move up

TSLA is on one today
sorry man, I'm not a middle aged woman with nothing better to do with my life.
Is it this?
It mooned after my contracts expired. So yes what you are saying true but younger me didn‚Äôt have the experience trading contracts at the time. You are on Wall Street bets people are buying contracts that exp this week at the 875-900 range since they are the cheaper options to buy.
No. That‚Äôs the company that drills holes. This was TSLA
Who?
RIP to my Tsla calls.
I work for Microsoft so my base is on the lower end, lol. But it's a great company to work for, so that makes it all gravy.
Yes, I understand scale and it‚Äôs effect on percentages. That‚Äôs still a crazy feat to accomplish for physical manufacturing.

There are ways to avoid IV crush. Go stocks or go more ITM &amp; choose longer maturities. So yeah, the fact that last quarter $TSLA mooned after earnings still stands. Whether FDs were destroyed is another thing.
The game isnt that easy.
If you invested $10,000 in IBM 10 years ago, you'd have *checks notes* less money.

If they did 100b then maybe that would be an argument

Anyone work for a top tech company? What‚Äôs your salary?

Or a medium-tech company
You‚Äôre not good at this, learn before throwing money away
Well $13.7b for a quarter‚Ä¶ when you compare it to the $850b market cap actually doesn‚Äôt sounds that crazy overvalued as some say.
Accidentally channeled my inner /u/axemanfromma and bought a shitload of spy 460c‚Äôs for Monday instead of next Friday because dates are hard. Oh well, if we hit a new ATH tomorrow I‚Äôll be rolling in Benjamins.
last quarter $TSLA mooned after earnings

Hold SPY Puts

Hold TSLA Puts

Hold GME even harder
Revenue miss that's why
Because the man sits in the big boy chair
Lol same here, bought a 950C for 0.37. Cant care less if it completely goes bust.

Since I‚Äôll be banned for a week here in a bit, don‚Äôt forget to do your pushups and drink some water!
Probably a bad choice of words for a spaceship company.
It‚Äôs gonna inverse your comment
Did Tesla sell their Bite Koin?
I live right by their HQ. You want me to commit arson for your puts?
The future
Nah. my puts are dated 11/12.  I got time.  Time for the Elongated Muskrat to fall on his face.
Betting on TSLA to go upward in a retarded fashion for no reason whatsoever is a winning play.
Losing money doesn't make you smart, just above the threshold of profitable stupidity.
Spy taking a shit tomorrow
TSLA automotive gross margins over 30%. üöÄüöÄüöÄs tomorrow, don‚Äôt care about after hours bs.
I used to play Hd a lot until it just kept climbing, so then I buy calls and still get fuked
SPY had a whopping 35 mil in volume today. 
  
(*That's not whopping at all. That's actually like 1/3 to 1/2 of normal volume, and it's been decreasing steadily all week*)
Still more believable than a $130 gain
Volume sux
Damn, that's a blast from the past
I mean what some of you seem to be missing is that the supply chain is mega fucked which is a risk off switch despite an earnings beat. Guidance is just as, if not more important!
Explain why Harvard, Columbia, or any of these overpriced shitters aren‚Äôt any where in the top feeder schools for high paying tech jobs in Silicon Valley (the sector with the highest job growth in the future).
I'll bet you $10 TSLA is gonna have bullish af earnings call and pre market movement and then tomorrow at 9:30 AM Mr. Market will unzip and say "bend over" while theta gang crowd around in a circlejerk to watch
No Balls here.  Probably made the right call with the TSLA iron condor, but only did 1 buy/sell of each.
Amazon had bad earnings last time. I forget why but I remember it went down
"IBM. Let's build a smarter planet." Yeah, without you, useless boomer company
https://ir.tesla.com/#tab-quarterly-disclosure

Usually can just Google ‚Äú[insert company name] investor relations‚Äù and it will be the first page
TSLA beats earnings and dumps 5 dollars fuck you logic
TSLA just playing with FD holders‚Äô feelings at this point.
Are you new to TSLA earning? Good earning = drill it literally played the same pattern for months
Gonna be worthless sorry ): learned from netflix‚Ä¶ and IV crush dominates
Musk will announce he is getting back together with Grimey and Disney is making a movie about their romance. Stock goes to $1200 before market open
Always green.
Then I must be a genius
Like Jeez I mean it‚Äôs $0.36 At close but theta is -0.63
Tsla ah lit as fuck. Very pretty.
Gonna be a week's worth of theta gang wins eh
[deleted]
Slaughtering grounds*
That would be legendary
yea the stock is flat so IV will get crushed bigly tomorrow
Where did you find them then?
Never do earrings I learned that the hard way last quarter for tesla
Fake dip any whale can buy that dip. Tesla going brrrrrrrrr tomorrow!
I'm more interested in TSLA earnings when we go into a bear market.
BY GOD IS THAT ELON WITH A METAL CHAIR???
Unless it splits üòÄ
You born yesterday?
Need SPCE to explode
the good ol you could do a lil better ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Guh there go my tesla calls
Ripü™¶ to all TSLA call/put holder you‚Äôll be in theta gang prayers üôè
Anyone else starting to think the dumber you are the more money you make in this market. Just have to be dumb enough though
Got some Home Depot puts like an idiot
Think again.
I‚Äôm buying if it goes to 250, put it In my potential buy list
Yeah it made me lol
[deleted]
My favorite part about earnings season is people yoloing FDs not knowing this is theta gang's hunting grounds
Why not both? *Diversify*
Elon hurry up and tweet something.
It‚Äôs not even down a percent.

The call isn‚Äôt for an hour.

Go outside.
Something tells me tomorrow should be wild day üëÄ
Alexa - play "Highway to Hell"
Damn big dawg congrats!!
Can i ask how much u started with?

Also obligatory fuka u!!!
Tomorrows a big red day and the start of the apocalypse
I was up 200% on the ones I sold on Monday 

Looking like it might have been the top
$DOLE made a little jump in after hours
Are you new?
It‚Äôs not 5:30 and WSB thinks TSLA and SPY is fucked lmao
Your about to get double teamed by a guy named IV and a guy named -
and the crowd goes mild for TSLA earnings
First time?
Indeed it does
Tsla go +25% after hours and then open flat/slightly down ü§£
Even $900 was a stretch this week imo
Volume in TLRY is very huge looks like LUCID before to up 50%
Because they know ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Tesla taking everyone down with it
I bought puts on my dreams years ago
Yeah I‚Äôd double check your sources bro lol
Not sure what's going on with BA, but almost 25000 contracts traded for 220$ strike for this Friday and they've been buying all the dips in the last few days. Bought some today.
Daahmp eet
Yeah its almost stupid, most of the info realtors present can be accomplished via a google search.

Plus google presents more info too, about crime COL, job prospects and etc
And TSLA finally made up its mind
the priced in was priced in
damn i almost taught myself a $1700 dollar lesson today, i was thinking about holding that 2 dte atm tsla call. like i actually had the captial to exercise lmao. who the fuck gave me options access lol seriously
$265c on deck
Meh -1% isn‚Äôt enough to overcome iv crush. Ur puts r fuk
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
-$100 since I only bought 1 call expiring in 2 days ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Tesla dropping to levels that we haven‚Äôt 
seen since Monday.
Looks like some of us will be more accepting if given the chance to participate in some children's games for money soon xD
Broke 21 and stayed after the close
get your license then genius and save the difference plus get the write offs.
tsla u slut
The numbers don‚Äôt get released until 5:30
Tsla ready to pull a reverse nflx
Now imagine, It's been Netflix and tesla so far. I think we know Amazon is going to be the next victim soon
Red tomorrow‚Ä¶. Green thursday‚Ä¶ yah u belong here
Not since they cancelled the Aptiva
Wtf why is TSLA dropping after beating earnings. First NFLX and now TSLA. My calls are going to expire worthless even though I correctly predicted these earnings beats.
GD Tsla alright give me my band and $ROPE
Just a couple lottos. Nothing big. Does that get you a little moist at least?
THEY CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS üò≠
Am I reading this correctly?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
RIP to my Tesla calls
Spy gonna take a mega shit tomorrow
Theta doesn't affect you as badly.
Wow, TSLA beat and the stock is going nowhere fast. A bit down. Of course, too early to say.
P R O G
Tomorrow is Thursday you idiot
TSLA isn‚Äôt a revenue company it‚Äôs a dreams company so who cares if it beats on Rev ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
LOL @ IBM
Cashing my tesla lotto tmw haha. I picked right
i made the comment before it came out, at least my first attempt at posting this comment. I'm a huge TSLA bull, i think this ER was overhyped leading up, itll kiss 800 and then go to mars

Looks like Lam and IBM are dragging down AMAT.
big tech got a tall tall bar, investors wanna see damn near 200% beats
meet. kevin is so funny with his noob followers over tesla earnings. gonna dump big at open!
God I just looked at the volume on the 10/22 $1000c TSLA
It was up so much why would u do that. Literally everyone knew it was going to dunp
This is probably correct. Sold half my shares.  Will get back in if it drops over next several months
IBM is for the boomers who think Pfizer is too risky
once they were allowed in SPY theta gang got the green light
TLRY
TSLA red tomorrow, green Friday.
Connections &gt; your skills , you go to the top schools for the best connections in the world
Fucking Tesla‚Ä¶should have known it would dip no matter the numbers
What‚Äôs your source VisualMod?
Lube up
TesGUH
Yo what‚Äôs up?
Good enough for me!
We are just in explosive euphoria times
Break up Wall Street/Pharma/Washington/banks and corporatization of public resources.
Just wait
 This is a trap
I‚Äôm here for TSLA option holders gainzzz
TSLA needs some milk
TSLA is priced to grow like 20x by 2030 so your 15% beat on revenue or whatever means nothing
TSLA pulling a NFLX ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
6% realtor fee is insane, i don‚Äôt know how they were getting away with that for so long
This Tesla after hour drunkenness is making me piss and shit myself

That‚Äôs the spirit!
1000% not
Yeah. 800 by EOW
Tesla is gonna dip as always and buy that fucking dip‚Ä¶ those numbers are fucking strong‚Ä¶
Post the porn when you get the chance
I made bank with them like a year ago and have been looking for the right time to buy back in ever since. Will definitely be joining you soon
Why buy TSLA options when you can buy SPY calls!!
I am betting on Zero

The company‚Äôs net profit margin is projected at 24%, down from 26% in the year-ago quarter, as Google continues investing heavily into new products and services.

Every one of those colleges are overrated. The job climate is way more interested in your skills than where you went now. Those college just charge students a premium for their name and their ability to get you in front of a hedge fund who donates to the school.
My chances of being banned are mooning.
Plz go to 250 PYPL so I can get some LEAPS üôè
It missed REV expectations. One number will mess it up.
so you're telling me those 10/22 1000cs might not print?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Yeah right... your "girlfriend" never went down on you.
Dump
The visual design of Tesla's earnings call countdown page seems very bullish. Scared for my SPY puts
In hindsight TSLA $950c wasn‚Äôt the best idea I‚Äôve ever had
They release the report before the call
CSX EPS beats by $0.06, beats on revenue
My the people who tried to play tesla earnings be forever known as true warriors gone but never forgotten
if you could time it down to seconds, you could make a killing (if they allowed us to play calls/puts AH) I could only imagine watching those if this happened during real hours üòÇ
Not sure theta gang has ever lost on TSLA earnings. But I know the one time I try iron condors, it‚Äôs going to be the ER that finally stops the music
Either way they can bank on their shares
Seriously, I just need it to hold $600 to stay green.
Good news is bad news, bad news is good news.

What‚Äôs the bad news?
13.76 bn vs 13.63 bn

Around 1% beat in revenue 

Expected more tbh

How many addys today? I know you don‚Äôt want to hear otherwise but those calls are theta fucked.
Break up IBM

Diamond handing these calls to 1000% or expiring worthless ;)

Are they really going to pin this at the closing price?
That's actually exactly the plan for now.

Another flawless victory by theta gang on TSLA
Its been 11m, so... no Theta rn
Lmaoo Tesla doesn‚Äôt know whether to dump or moon.
bro tsla either dump or rip stop playing with my feelings
been watching SNDL over 6 months now and the chart looks like it's time! Hence, started a position today and will support the dips going forward.
IBM puts win the day.
I heard 5

Tesla is fucking drunk haha
Er is at 5:30 but people are selling either to take profit or take run up money
Tough decision to sell my pins calls or not.  Offer at around 70 from Paypal but they told MSFT to go fuck themselves in the 80's last year when online was at peak.  User numbers must be shit this Q once again if they are willing to sell.
I‚Äôm glad I own tsla üòÇüòÇüòÇ

What time is he gonna open his mouth?
That‚Äôs how earnings go lol, they make no sense
Do not lie to me son. In truth is your salvation
shit going to be side way until earning then drop 15% after that

&gt; Tesla is a company that makes electric cars and batteries. Tesla has been profitable every year since it was founded in 2003, and has never had any debt. The market cap of Tesla is $49 billion, or about 1/6th the size of General Motors (GM).

Y‚Äôall would make me look at the Tesla chart. Now I have this epileptic seizure.
Yes, I think lack of preguidance this quarter and the recent scrap acquisition are both incredibly bullish indicators. Lack of preguidance because the CEO LG wants to have a blowout earnings this Q, and the acquisition bc it indicates a substantially improved FCF position.

bears have been saying Tesla overprice since it was 200$ presplit, and now it's almost 5000$.   when will they learn.   tesla to 900$.
TSLA ready to bounce around. Pay those Iron Condors

Congrats fucker! 
You unlocked life
130th or so.
So I bought 69 10/22 456c's before close and at this moment I am down $0.69 total. What more bullish dd do you need?
Puts on Harvard
Lmaoooo the dump
Edit
lmaooo the rip.
yes and commons
TESLA is wilin out
Good luck TSLA fd‚Äôs. I nuked another account via NFLX. Taking a break I am house broke
Still top 3
Fetus position in the corner darkest part of a room
The IV isn‚Äôt even bad.

I‚Äôm confused as to how people allow themselves to get fucked by IV. It‚Äôs baffling.
WISH!!!! Should of bought more in the 4s. Doh!
TSLA fell off a cliff from $865.50 to $865.49 


RIP

Cmon TSLA. Let‚Äôs bring that hulk smash
Does the low volume mean the green is fake and gay a precursor to really green when volume picks up?
Subscribe to his onlyfans then
Nice try
But Ford‚Ä¶
Increase in IV
Also IV

TESLA OPTIONS COME WITH A SIDE OF ROPE
üî• ZNGA, TLRY, BB, COIN. üîç TSLA. This is the way.
10 more minutes to buy your SPY puts before it's not October 20 anymore
increase of implied volatility.
u/dynojoe27 and u/carbonlatte thought they could get first comment and of course failed because I am the greatest wsb user alive. 
  
They thought they could just delete their comments and hide their failures. I think not

That‚Äôs what the option market suggests
?
Biden‚Äôs spending bill + TSLA earnings = me buying a brand new Audi RS3 when $SPY is $460
Harvard is overrated now
Options?
530 Tesla earnings drop
Csx I hope you do well
I‚Äôm just here to watch the Tesla yolos
[deleted]
Sounds like you have a habit to try and flip 100% or
More in profit as fast as possible. Just chill. Find stocks that are bullish and wait for them to have a rough day or two then but in long dated contracts
Is TSLA going to go flat?
Should have bought IBM a week out before close, feel it's gonna pop.
I‚Ä¶.V
Nah it's mine bro
It‚Äôs everyday bro! üòé
I surpassed a million today. Feels nuts. I've been blasting sets since it happened to spread the energy. Super drunk too. I can't believe this.
Going to buy some more BB stock and options
Ever heard of a forward projection?
Fake pump
Imagine your title is Whip Dick Durban
Fuck I was on the phone while the market closed. We‚Äôll holding these spy calls ü§ûüèΩ
Bitch boi
Gonna dump AH
I went to Harvard and my PT for Tesla is $200. 75% downside
5 pm
I once read that you should never average up god I wish I had listened to that advice
I hoped it fucked over the monsters:anti-Americans that bought puts right before it
GREEN LIGHT. RED LIGHT WITH MY PORTFOLIO ON THIS TESLA EARNINGS
How do you crush when there‚Äôs no IV
Tesla be good. Drag Apple with you towards the skies ü§ë
Call me a retard, but why do my calls increase in price sometimes when the stock drops in price? Puzzles me every time but Idk what to even look up. Is it something with the gamma?
#üö´üêÄ
Dear diary, it‚Äôs day 6 and my puts still bleeding.
I bet Tesler is flat af again
MSFT needs to run up before the 26th. Really hope it can open big and maintain some Shrek dicks
BB stayed flat today instead of dumping ass like I thought it might. That's a good sign.
Yo transferring from RB to another brokerage takes 75$ as a fee. I am a poor fresh out of college kid who lives in the scam that is NYC. Kinda tight
You two should meet up and do it together as a bonding exercise
Holy fuck, what is so hard to understand?

It‚Äôs *my money.*

MINE.

Just fucking *give it to me*. No one else deserves to have it.
In today's news: Everyone is getting IV crushed tomorrow by TSLA
Tesla gonna kill the market
sands has got to boom

Bye Tesla call buyers
It doesn't have that capability. Everyone knows Tesla is it's own beast.
Alright TSLA let‚Äôs see it
Fidelity doesn't even bother emailing me about my margin calls anymore.  

Like you can STFU with your 300% maintenance requirement, I'm gonna hold this $20k short AFRM until it hits $100, or you force me to close, bitch.
Hoping that TSLA dumps hard. Overvalued as shit
TESLA CALL IS AT 5 PM. MOVEMENT BEFORE THEN MEANS FUK ALL.

THIS WAS MY PSA. THANK YOU.
&gt;I think semi conductor shortages are gonna fuck em

What nonsense is this? Q3 deliveries are already out. It isn't about deliveries in this ER.
Netflix starting a new series called Tesla Game
Same I have a massive portion of my net worth riding in this
Seriously wtf with that green spy dildo out of nowhere at close
Papi
I'm here for TSLA options holders loss porn
I'm trying this new thing called 'discipline'.

Back in it after a month and a half off the casino and easy flipped 1k into 3.2k on CVS 85c bought yesterday.

Looked at 6x TSLA 900c weekly and was about to buy but didn't. Let's see if it was a good choice. Holding cash overnight is rare for me when I was full degen.
Bought 2 TSLA shares at close, just for the fun of it.
#BB üåô tomorrow üçáüöÄ
Yuge
TLRY, WISH
I never liked this money anyway.
Papa Elon plz
and I was in it. Sold weeklies yesterday for some nice gains and reloaded earlier today before the PINS news. Fml.
SPY got sport mode on this week.
[deleted]
#BB ran into close. Probably nothing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
FB 342.5c for Friday. Praying for some big green off of SNAP earnings tomorrow night.
that last minute SPY green dildo was glorious
You're Heisenberg?
I am most certainly getting ass blasted again tomorrow
Now we see if Tesla pumps or dumps the market.
Looks like you business boys are finally learning the power of holding/not selling memes at a loss! üòé
KMI let's rip baby
I'm holding the line with my 2 SPY puts
CSX calls ü§ëü§ëü§ë
PayPal ended the day at -13.37
so we seriously gotta wait 90 mins for earnings now?
Praying $PLTR rebounds tomorrow
SOFI CALLS
IM GONNA BE RICH
Tesla will screw both sides today best case scenario gap up open to fade tomorrow for easy money
#I told you market was making you bears load up on more puts‚Ä¶.gg see y‚Äôall tomorrow
Time to get drunk and race sailboats.
Spy volume hilariously low
Savage close.
I need CLF to kick doors down
That's what I was planning to do anyway
Small bet against Tesla I think semi conductor shortages are gonna fuck em
Buy more GAMB gambling stock
I'm here for the TSLA ü§°show
The great thing about options is that when they hit zero you don't have to worry about losing any more money.
ALRIGHT LET THE $TSLA SHREK DICK AH BATTLE BEGIN
All in Tesla puts
That SPY fakeout and surge in the last 2mins.
Wow. What a boring ass day that was.
Fail
My Tsla 900c filled at 12:59. Lfg boyz
Seriously no one gives a shit about any of the other earnings
WISH closed above $6. Who‚Äôs licking my peenee?
I‚Äôm scared now.
lets do it TSLA

i want to hear extra screeching
I wipe the cheeto dust off my fingers. Feeling energized by my mom's tendies, I can finally accomplish what my day's purpose is. I set aside my waifu pillow, even though I can hear her begging for me to make love to her for the third time today. "Sorry baby, I have to do this", I tell her, as I throw her on my bed, knowing she enjoys it when a big, strong man such as myself does that. "I'll be back for you soon". I sit down at my desk and begin concentrating. Visualizing success, meditation, all of that good stuff - this next moment is important, not just for myself, but for my brothers and sisters.

I open up wallstreetbets, go to the daily, and comment "bulls lmaaaooooo".
Going to furiously masturbate during Tesla earnings.
Show time
The 5 mins are always the worst
Good girl SPY
All eyes on TSLA
Tesla's gonna crush earnings while I'm gonna crush this fucking burrito with extra guac üåØ
First

Yes, WHO has a history of doing this.
Well the Fed did say they'll increase interest rates eventually, didn't they? I thought if the interest rates increased the price of housing will decrease to match the market. I saw meet kevin talk about that on YT..

Thanks for letting me know about monetary policy. It's a new term (not an economics major) and I love learning new things!
Let's not talk about uranium. I've been slowly adding to my positions the last year and I'd like to add a bit more before they turn into meme stocks.
This morning was the ‚õΩ. VIX and TNX gotta do their thing so they can ease off again. I ain't saying it's gonna be a fat dump
Find a decent 6 or 7 who has a rocking body.  Won't bitch and guarantee 10x better in bed than the hottie.  Might even cook you a meal once in a while

Ok but why is no one talking about Uranium. It has gone way up. That is probably what the rich will use to hedge against inflation.

I have no doubt this dude has autism or mental issues. 

But yeah i hear ya, some of the best programmers are full blown autists. I remember in undergrad we had to wire a raspberry pi with a sequence of lights to represent a traffic signal. We all showed up with our rag tag wiring and about 10 lines of code. This fucking autist that toted a rolling suitcase to school for his backback had some crazy pvc encased model with like 300 lines of code. 

This dude reminds me of the rolling suitcase backpack guy

Yeah it should dip unless they announce something crazy. I‚Äôm ready for 900 my one call is already up 50 percent today
That was me yesterday, 15k profit and today 17k loss ‚ò∫Ô∏è
but they don't let crayons on the big boy table
Hopefully bidenflation doesn't eat that up
Am a bull but bought SPY puts for Monday. Will sell any profits and go right back into calls
Imagine thinking the market will collapse and go to hell because rates will go from 0.25% to 0.75%

Hi Cosmo
Or just sell directional spreads. But yeah, today was easy money. Gotta take what the market gives!
Basically the last run-up was a delayed covid play. Their parks were reopening and Disney+ turned out real profitable. I missed that one üò¢
your last 10 posts are you talking about your job lol. this is WSB not Dear Diary.
Yes, wonder how they pumped it for a bit though, must have been some crazy news.
Haha it happens, the Float is almost 2 bil takes  long time for a freight train like that to build up momentum. Makes it remarkably stable. I sell Iron Condors on stocks like that.
Congrats, you can now increase your expenses to $22,500 per month so it‚Äôs like you got no raise at all!
Haha, funny thing is if I had waited 5 mins more, would have 3x my money, instead I closed at close to 80% loss‚Ä¶

Ahh.. life of a gambler and the things we say to rationalize random events.
[deleted]
It's ok man I chased the AMZN pump with 0DTE this morning and went from up 10% to down 80% in about 30 minutes
nice plays.
I honestly have no idea why, but literally _every single person_ I have ever seen bring up forth in internet forums has had profound mental health issues. Im actually not trying to be disparaging here, it really puzzles me.   
  
Maybe that's actually the strongest possible endorsement a language can receive? Like if its what the people with _actual_ Autism are into its gotta be good?
Thanks! New person just trying to understand, appreciate it.
Oh don't worry I'm not buying any options or planning on it lol I'm just trying to wrap my head around it all, but I appreciate the warning. I did say it was a dumb question lol
Just take a computer class and honestly you can do so much with just that

damn another few centuries of bag holding for me
The 500 year chart still shows the head-and-shoulder pattern, sorry buddy
just bought too far otm fds. should've rolled over earlier in the week but i was just too stubborn. It was tell and irnt. They'll pop eventually but for now, no monies
i thought the 350 year bear market would turn eventually
The last week doesn't make up for all the losses over the past month, but it's nice to see some green and the ability to sell to close an option contract or two without just taking a loss.
Just sprayed the Poo Pourri and now it‚Äôs time to sit in my office
What was the 1pm Pamp on DIS; lost like 6k on 0DTE FOMO ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
did you get out üòÅ
It such a dumb rule. I understand why they do it but you should have the ability to turn it off and take the risk
am permabull. this looks super trappy.
I think they've got themselves a whole heap of newly minted 'long-term investors' now.....
When you apply just say you make more money than you do and have been trading options for a long time. I was honest and that was my mistake lol
TSLA holders are so sensitive
TDA has auto exercised me into margin on a uvxy before. They‚Äôve also auto sold a spy call at 3:15 before. And today they let me diamond hand them.

I‚Äôm switching to fidelity soon anyway. Hope I don‚Äôt get denied gambling
My mom told me to get myself something and slap her name on it this year lol my family doesn't give any fucks anymore
Does TDA auto sell? I have a Fidelity account but they denied me for options trading lol
Cool. Hope it works out for you üëç
Calls on your DNA.
I'm not a bear. I have a shitload of calls open. I just buy defensive puts in this environment
This but actually
Great job could have been worse
I have options for next week and extra money to average down. This hasn‚Äôt happened in a while. We hood rich my n words.
There‚Äôs one quote that has stuck with me

I thought those gaps would close today. But low and behold TSLA, AAPL and AMZN saving SPY
Ya he said specifically that‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna pay for the starship. He‚Äôd never do it without starship. But if he actually makes that work it‚Äôll be more valuable than starlink.

I would also go all in on the starlink ipo
Seems like the only way to reliably profit from SPY when it's not pendulum swinging 10-point widths.
I'm not cashing out, Im selling a portion. You don't have to be a dick about it.
this all feels like a bull trap. Prepare accordingly
&gt; I am not a truck driver. I do not have a job.
I was thinking to do but noticed tesla moves is quiet stable in the past days and I could be toasted. Fortunately closed AMZN spread at the open for small loss. I should have inversed my self ü§°
Im 27 too. Im a truck driver &amp; make 80k. How do i apply for your job?
$400, $100 and $150 here
the 5 year spy chart is frightening and shit usually goes down on Mondays in October. Plus it's frothy, it's too optimistic, and the retail investor always "loses"
Cheers, will keep an eye next week.
Had a great week only lost 50% of my portfolio usually I‚Äôm at the 90% loss area
Down for the day but up for the week. I guess I‚Äôll take it
Huh. The bid/ask is .05/.10? Are you super deep in them or is your account like 20 bucks?
On what basis?
Haven't heard a word about sdc this week. Pumped and dumping.
Love how fidelity continues to drill my options into after hours.
after, in 2025
I had 830 too. TDA actually let me diamond hand mine today but sold at 840. Too bad it wasn‚Äôt a yolo.

Parked itself near the 50, hopefully will do what SPY did today and gap on right thru Monday
Lol I had $830- but the theta was like 2. I also have Robinhood so it would have automatically sold my call at 12:05 when it was still under 835

fucking 0DTE Amazon calls going from $3 to $2500 in a fucking day fuck fuck fuck FOMO
Shorted amzn at 3380, rip me
Is VisualMod becoming self-aware?
just put my whole account into 10/22 TSLA $875c
Hey VSauce. Michael here.   

Autists trade weekly FDs on SPY. But what *is* trade? (Vsauce music intensifies)
No worries, just make sure that you are choosing a short call option that - worst case scenario if assigned - will still net you profit. "In the Money" has a great youtube vid about PMCC.
sell once you reach your price target and don't get greedy

As I kid I loved Fridays, know it‚Äôs just a day where all I see are selloffs
What we talking here? Weeklies? Leaps?
Tsla and other tech stocks did what SE was supposed to do continue running up!!
we need to keep these stats and make wsb playing cards
FB about to pop!
What are you holding with high confidence on this weekend
Tremendous DD
Same bro, degenerates roll out
TsLa is making what we call a breakout candle today, $870 Monday is my call
Imma gonna eat it

Nom nom nom
Launches coming up though so I'm not too worried
Who killed the Russell?
Tsla 950c for earnings ? ü•∞ü•∞
And it‚Äôs positive. Gonna print next week.
Imagine losing over half your portfolio on call credit spreads expiring today bc you bet against AMZN, SPY, and America herself 

Dumb ass lmaoooooooooo
Thought ABNB had hit a bottom, but nope.  All those headlines "Travel stocks rising due to travel bans relaxing earlier" lol lol lol
wp
If I DM feet pics to JPOW will he fix inflation
ROFL that TSLA pump. Imagine buying a 835C at 11:30 at the high of the day then be 80% down the rest of the day until randomly TSLA just decides to take some steroids and pump it to +200% (it me)
 how r u today

Thanks for taking a shit in my mouth RocketLab
The difference being CRSR actually has legit fundamentals.

Damn Tesla is doing good. I sold all my shares few months ago oh well
On PTO today. How's my TSLA $750 ban bet looking?
Fuk it, going in CRSR.

Lmao its almost like the theta is baked right in

Damn and with 10 minutes left till close.  Fucking savage VisualMod
who will MM pay out today? amzn 3400c or 3400p!?!?!

10 mins to go
It was almost 100% removed because it wasn‚Äôt market moving news or in depth enough to qualify as DD. This sub doesn‚Äôt have a hard-on for AMC or anything dude. I would say the majority of people that still comment here know it‚Äôs a struggling chain and not a solid long term investment. 

The rules for post submissions are easy enough to find, people always complain about mod bias but almost every time the removed posts break the rules in some way.
shit Shit SHIT
My port might be crumbling from meme stonks but I get unimaginable joy from anyone who took a üåàüêª position on TSLA in the last month.
The last SPY hurrah

yeah, great point, and i can't imagine how all those were priced in so quickly - but a correction here and there, yes good healthy, and recessions, while they do need to happen eventually, are much less fun

Finally a nice day after a few weeks of blah.  AMZN, NVDA, TSLA makes for a nice weekend.
Best stock to sell CCs on every week?
Nothing like watching an option expire worthless. -99.38% almost there buddy...
Anyone playing AMEX earnings next week?
Stranger danger
Maybe you should try selling options then?

See you all in 5 days!
We call that a PMCC (Poor Man's Covered Call). It's one of the more popular Theta Gang strats.
Ever buy the wrong expiration on an option? Yeah I just did and lost 100 bucks...and I‚Äôm not even drunk. Fun way to end the week.
[deleted]
lol had some bad trades today eh?
Market green. My portfolio red.
The beautiful thing about PLTR is that I get older but it stays the same price
It woke up just before close
Agreed, I kinda hope it dips after earnings honestly so I can buy my 50th share cheaper lol bought my 49th share this morning at 827 lol
Me and you both, thought it seemed crowded
CRSR is the new wish. A stonk wsb has touted but will make many lose money lol
Get TsLa a helmet, it's going into full retard mode for next week...
Just fucking fly SPY.
u/buythetulipdips bought tulips futures, duh..

/u/drdarkpiccolo (0/1) made a bet that BB would go to 11.675 when it was 9.34 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
I'm thinking of buying deep in the money SPY calls and selling shorter term calls on SPY. Do you guys think this is a good idea?
Someone quick talk me out of shorting the shit out of $COIN.

!RemindMe 1 year
Sorry father, you can go down on me anytime you want
Thank you guys for your discussions. I ended my second option ever played today on a put, hoping OCGN would crash and it did. Therefore I made some money. Not much, but enough to learn a bit more on options. All you people of this group rock!
Burrytards, you will never become rich by sucking Burry's dick clean.
Why are you even still in it lol should‚Äôve got out weeks ago
So I recently tried to post some info about AMC on WSBs showing how the local AMC theater where I live had about 5 people total for the Bond opening premier. Apparently you all can‚Äôt handle any criticism or truth so it was just taken down for no reason. I find it so interesting that people who complain about the financial system being rigged and being the underdogs will then take down posts that show anything that goes against the narrative of which stocks they like. I have avoided all possible words that would get the post removed by auto mods. So if it‚Äôs removed again then it‚Äôs just more roof of how WSBs is basically full of the exact same people who you all seem to be against. Either accept truth or silence it, the theater was nearly empty. That‚Äôs a fact. And it doesn‚Äôt care about your options calls or investments.

So every stock should‚Äôve been mooning then.  But that wasn‚Äôt the case.  TSLA was moving opposite of the market.
Holding chpt plug fubo uwmc calls thru weekend
TSLA just smashed thru 840 wall
He‚Äôs buying a Nissan Leaf
Sold mine for 2 pennies.
All this week, SPY negative, VXX negative. Today it flips. Nice
Just broke a record on how fast ive bought and sold calls with these tsla 839-839.80 bounces
COME ON TSLA 840!!!!!
Give us $840+ close TsLa
Detroit style is good for a change of pace...enjoyed it
SDC gents, it‚Äôs a good thing this dick is small cause we getting fucked, no lube. 17m borrowed shares made available for shorting. Rip
Whether I am or not, he really never did have proof. His whole dumb theory was based off of bad assumptions and he convinced several people it was rock solid fact and that ‚Äúwhoever bought these calls must have insider info‚Äù.  PERHAPS I do hate on fools now and then but at least I don‚Äôt try to drag other people here in to bad trades
Yeah it seemed more likely it could happen 10 minutes ago when it was going vertical but doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs in the cards

Same amount that was sold in the morning. Short.
If every poor stop working and go on strike , the min wage for fast food/retail will go up to $30+ overnight. Amazon is already offering $22 an hour with a sign up bonus. Amazon would probably be offering $40-$50 per hour if every warehouse slave went on strike.

Who has that to gamble with?

Same with AMZN. Too poor for calls or shares.
Why such moon on TSLA though, over the last few months?  Supply issues, Chinese market fucked up... What are the positive catalysts?
Should've, but even back then it was overpriced lmao

Tsla got rejected off 840 4 times within the past 15 mins. This is a prime example of how my love life is going.

You can make money on a bad trade, and lose money on a good one.
It's ok spy, die. 

I took off the bull suit
HUT about to explode into close
I don't think it's actually worth a trillion dollars, not anywhere CLOSE to a trillion.

Competition will prove to the TSLA bulls that they are not the only electric car people want to buy.
it's so predictable it's amazing. swing traders dream.
I mean it would be pretty tarded if TSLA ran another $20

Markets are doing that thing again where everything is overbought, everyone is bullish, all the unsolved problems don't exist.  Two days ago it was bearish AF.

Because a couple huge banks made lots of money from asset management inflows because markets have been going up at record pace.  This is some kinda cycle.
Dumb fuck still using robbinghood. Karma is a bitch. You deserve this
what options are yall buying at close today and selling monday morning?
Sold my SPCE @ 60 awhile ago, and have had a buy order ever since for SPCE @ 14. We are getting pretty close and i'm getting trigger happy. Should I wait?
Did someone just actually buy 1.2M SOFI shares or is that an error...
amzn options so expensive. woulda bought leaps if it didn't feel like such a ....well....leap
Those returns are too big my brain hurts
Wtf was anyone else logged out of Robinhood?
Best and brightest traders on the street are bond traders and it‚Äôs a well known fact.

More liquid markets than equity and WSBs think is just for boomers
Go home TSLA. You‚Äôre high.
Tesla doing another options juiced run with no one actually buying shares. 

Elon‚Äôs family office jamming that shit higher for when he sells after earnings. Gotta cover that 56% tax burden and make sure he has the $16 bil he owes Morgan Stanley.
Enjoy the IV crush
&gt; step 3: profit
Now calculate what that 150 would‚Äôve turned to with otm amzn calls
You‚Äôll be fine, I bought tsla at its peak 6 months ago, and now I held and up 6k, after being down 11k at one point
I almost bought a $375 call at the pre-lunch dip and would've been up 50%. Instead I bought and OTM put and lost it all.

Everyone fomoing into TsLa 10/22 calls? 

In on $880c/$900c
Watching options expire worthless fills a void in me.
TSLA is also the OG TSLA
I bought some 12/22 VIX 18 calls this morning. Goes above 20 at least once a month this past year. Wish I'd have realized this sooner. 

Seems like a 100% winner so somehow I'll manage to lose money on this one.
Coulda turned 150 into 1k today off otm tesla calls right at open. It‚Äôs a cold world

#ESCORT NIGHT BOYS
Lol tsla 839.99 high today
Nice
TSLA 10/15/2021 850.00 C  


damnit, so close
BAN BET LOST

u/MichaelBurry made a bet that TSLA would go to $200 when it was $840 and it did not, so he was BIGLY fukt

Is Burry in here downvoting TSLA bulls again?
how‚Äôs your 401K doing
If people knew the future why the fuck would they tell retards in a place like this?

I think the coming week also we will see uptrend
[deleted]
Maybe a dip at open Monday but I doubt it will last long
Oof
TSLA 850 Monday seems likely at this point
TSLA üöÄ
Can confirm -  
my ass = blasted
Every time I buy an option I tell myself, "I'm not going to hold this until expiration." I'm good at selling too early and at least taking some profits, but if it loses 20% of it's value I insist on holding it until it expires worthless. Why.
AMZN we like the stock

[deleted]
Yes
TSLA's gain today is the equivalent of Nissan lmao
Change platforms
Was thinking about it honestly did nov 1 just to be safe ima buy more calls for later oct prob lol
I won't
The nice part about being poor is that your portfolio can be down 50% in a single day, and your net worth really doesn't change. You are still worth whatever your organs go for on the dark web, and that's kind of reassuring!

Something strange just happened to me with Robinhood. They decided to close a debit spread I had that is expiring today and was in the money. But they closed it with a market order and fucked me by 400 bucks. What can I do? If they had just let it be, it would close at close and I wouldn‚Äôt loose the 400 bucks

Edit: ok I won‚Äôt use robinhood anymore. But do other brokers do the same dumb shit? Fidelity never did this
Burry in the big bankruptcy
Elon is the true diamond hand. That dude almost never sell his stocks
Man they aren't going to let AMZN 3400 go ITM.  spy dump incoming.

Son of bitch, shit.
My *friend* will not be happy about that news

I never ever play weeklies but goddamn can't get over how much money I would have made on AMZN today.  Retirement level from $10k.  Oh well, I wouldn't have done it anyways.
CRSR gave me a massive down-payment on a house last year. It was a rocket in its first 9 months

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/EdinsonC (0/1) made a bet that QQQ would go to 362.0 when it was 366.46 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
On red days I do the opposite and pat my self for not ending on a low point and clawing some losses back. It‚Äôs a losing battle predicated on perfection which ends up clouding my judgement
Get your ass above 21.50 CLF
UVXY calls seem like free money
Very excited to lose money I see
You're gonna get gaped.

Elon dunking on Burry right now
I mean that'll happen by Thursday next week. Why not just buy and ITM call exp next friday at that point
Me too. So unhealthy.
Market bubbles
Lmao no you can‚Äôt not on RH. You have to have collateral to equal the cost of 100 shares per option if exercised. Otherwise they auto sell at 2pm

Agreed. Aside from a random 80 degree day today it's been cool and we've been doing basic bitch fall stuff the past few weekends. I secretly love it.

I like Fidelity. It‚Äôs not pretty but it‚Äôs very functional
RKLB is on sale for only one reason, my options are expiring today, yesterday was a solid profit but I waited for the kill.  So pretty much it will go up Monday like every other option I wait until expiration on, Monday it‚Äôs up.  So probably a good buy now since I‚Äôm out.

It‚Äôs one thing to be completely wrong on the direction.  You win some you lose some.  But to be right about it mooning but miss it by a day and go to -%99 instead of 10x‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a big OOF.
Tesla is going to 200, they said. It has shitty fundamentals, they said. What will the bears say when it‚Äôs the biggest company in the world?
who really needs corsair products, what do they do that is so different in the PC market
Does it really matter though?
FUCK YOU RH FOR AUTO SELLING MY CALLS. Now TSLA wants to hit my strike. Fucking bullshit worst app to trade on. I should stick with TD only
Wow Russell is weak af
my confidence is pretty solid. We'll see what happens. I'm long $UVXY for the rest of the afternoon. Stop loss in securing a profitable trade. I'd lean more on a power hour pullback vs a power hour rally. But we shall see
When does CRSR go back up?  Asking for a friend

**[Retarded potential](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retarded_potential)** 
 
 &gt;In electrodynamics, the retarded potentials are the electromagnetic potentials for the electromagnetic field generated by time-varying electric current or charge distributions in the past. The fields propagate at the speed of light c, so the delay of the fields connecting cause and effect at earlier and later times is an important factor: the signal takes a finite time to propagate from a point in the charge or current distribution (the point of cause) to another point in space (where the effect is measured), see figure below.

Damn $TSLA killing it‚Ä¶. Of course I got out two weeks back expecting a crash‚Ä¶. Figures‚Ä¶.
It ain‚Äôt easy
Whatever you do will probably be stupid but it's still as good a move as most people in this sub are making

Palantir is an edge against inflation. Inflation won‚Äôt hurt you if your money is gone while insiders have dilluted the stock and dumped the bags
No judgments here!
oh shit, never seen that before - way nicer. I appreciate kia updating their american logo...but I just think "KN" every time. I know they always got a bit of a bad rap, but the stinger does look pretty slick
Approval is just a matter of when. Definitely next week.

You won‚Äôt ban bet on red by close
Full retard
After an $11 move on SPY in 48 hours time, would it be stupid to buy some puts for next week? Asking for myself.

If BABA could go back to today‚Äôs high that would be awesome thanks
trillion dollar coin
After losing 50% of my gains on puts in the last month, I have decided to become a permabull. Literally nothing can cause the market to crash at this point. They could announce MegaCovid and SPY would rally to 500. Natural disasters? Priced in. Major global shortages? Transitory. Inflation? Not in my country. I cant wait until Tesla valuation passes the national debt and Elon buys the USA for the meme.
New KIAs look sick

i *was* feeling bad about my 10/18 435 puts, but people here have actually lost money on calls since wednsday. cashflow crying rn
Even the wildest perma bull should be ok with a little healthy recession, it literally cannot always go up. Better to have little short downs here and there then wait for the big ass bear bomb that WILL come eventually

Perion Network PERI having a dip, great time to hop on before next leg up. Triple bottom recovery right before what will be another huge quarter (as bullish as it gets). Just over being worth 1x revenues, very profitable, no debt, $100M+ cash in back pocket, grew over 80% YoY in Q2, very diverse and innovative (I work in the industry), and their peers are trading at 4-8x the valuation for similar performance. Ad tech‚Äôs best multibagger ROI potential and a hidden gem, and my highest conviction position. Was right with Tesla, Etsy, Revolve, Danaos, and now hopefully PERI is next.

I wonder why Corsair released preliminary results when they weren't very good. I thought companies do this when earnings are looking good. It kinda feels like they will take a double hit when earnings come out in November.
fuck it. How much higher can we push this rally? ü§°
&gt;150k $450c's for 10/15

Where do you get this information?
Super low atmo - volatility always returns. There‚Äôs no real stability in the market. I normally short VIX when over 24 and it always pays but it‚Äôs now under 17 so gone for calls.
Fuck that cuck
Anyone playing CLF earnings?

THE BATTLE FOR 446
just bought a JNJ LEAP. MACD just crossed over and RSI is pretty low still. I think earnings will be good in a couple weeks plus the booster shot will also probably get approved, which might keep momentum in a positive direction
Is it time for QQQ 1/15 $400 C yet?
GME and AMC are both garbage
Be safe playa!
difficult to predict what the asset that can‚Äôt be named does on the weekend. My guess is yes it seems to have momentum.

I‚Äôm scared to ask this question but I gotta ask: why in the world is AMC at $41. Like I completely understand GME (long live GME I‚Äôm buying all of if it goes to like $150), but the AMC thing doesn‚Äôt make sense.

Not that there is any good reason it should go up but they are very good at just making it go up and also they just buy any tiny little dip.

I‚Äôm contemplating deleting my Reddit account and saying fuck this sub. A piece of Shit like TMC literally made the mega thread. But I know when my bonus check hits I‚Äôll probably be back‚Ä¶
damn bruh, I usually sell at 35% loss.
If it holds over the weekend it should catch up to it.

When they go close to 43$ it's a buy for sure. The time you have the shares you sale covert call for extra money. Have a look at LIF-C if they drill down just by the dividend is pretty interesting since 9 months.

I guess my choices for an EV are between something that's overpriced and has shitty range guaranteeing it will depreciate to nothing instantly and be a huge waste of money, or something with fundamental deal breaker flaws that take essential function away from the vehicle thus allowing reasonable prices per mile of range. 

I guess I'll just buy the overpriced one where the range sucks but at least everything works right, and then in a few years when there's something better available for me to upgrade to, I'll sell it super cheap to someone who couldn't afford a newish electric car or anything luxurious otherwise. This way instead of feeling pissed off that I got ripped off on tends of thousands of dollars of depreciation I'll just feel like I spent all that money giving a nice gift to someone who can enjoy it.

Is this an inside joke or are they serious? I‚Äôve seen maybe half a dozen zoomer/scammers in my reels doing this like

‚ÄúInvest X in Y. Check out what happened‚Äù

Can I report them to the SEC for fun or?
No more hope and pray investing strategies. There‚Äôs got to be a better way
Wow

As much as I love buying Calls, I'm a reasonable risk averse investor so I mostly trade spreads. I don't open both legs at the same time usually, I buy a call and my ultimate goal is to sell a higher strike for what I paid for the first one. If I can't do that, I look for a 10bagger potential. If there's $2.50 spread between the strikes max profit is $250 so I look to sell the next leg for a $25 difference of what I paid, If the strikes are $1 apart I look to sell it for a $10 difference.

Bring back the yacht thread please
Dumb question, but when looking at candle charts, why is it for stocks/etfs that closely follow the indexes (or vice versa), price spikes/dips seem to often occur at the exact same time? 

Obviously, if a big ass candle forms on an AAPL chart, it will form on the SPY or QQQ chart, but why is one also forming on NVDA, MSFT, FB, etc charts? I understand the interrelation, but don't quite get what is technically happening - why does a increase in buy/sell orders for AAPL cause an increase in orders for NVDA at the same time? Was this the case before algos?
Market makers come and fuck your wifes boyfriend
How tf none of yall bullish on AT&amp;T? Warner bros acquisition, already owning a streaming service hbo, put those two together and its basically a netflix competitor while already having a huge telecom presence? Slashing that useless dividend so the stock can actually grow while making their balance sheet not so debt ridden. At these ten year low prices now that everyones grandma sold out because she cant live without that dividend, its time for the real liftoff. 640 shares at 25.98 and 1 july 15th 2022 25 call.

If you exercise a call you don‚Äôt have any realized gains, you just now have stock that has a lower cost basis than market price. If you then sell those shares that‚Äôs when you would have a tax event.
Well, almost blew up my account today with WFC calls expiring today.  Luckily theyre up like 2700% today.  Too bad im still down fucking 30%.  FML.
Retail sales jumped. The U.S. consumer is unshakeable.
I would appreciate an end of day dump. Probably won‚Äôt though. Probably open bigly green on Monday too and THEN start falling back.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. Unfortunately I said that like $150 ago so hopefully I‚Äôm not wrong again, just seems way too high for such a new stock
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
good false positive
WSB in a nutshell.
I feel like now is a poor/uncertain entry point IMO, with the supply chain issues a lot of people are betting on gas prices to raise significantly, and especially with natural gas in the winter as people begin to heat their homes we could see prices of natural gas and the stock price raise significantly. I personally wouldn‚Äôt be jumping into anything until at-least late winter when we have better idea of what‚Äôs going on. The majority of my portfolio is in oil and gas plays rn mainly long dated xom calls and they have been treating me real good. Why are you thinking stock drops going forward?
$WGO slightly spoiled their earnings I think. They announced a $150 million increase on their share buyback program yesterday, caused a +8% day to $78. However after 1pm, $WGO swung back down to $70. I think this was to inflict max pain today on 10/15 contracts which is at $70.

earnings are pre-market on Wednesday. if they increased their share buyback which was initially at 50million to 200 million, my reasoning is their earnings are good.

currently researching their supply chain and materials used to estimate the risk / reward for a large yolo play
I legit have no idea what I‚Äôm doing today

I'm not giving up this 10% chance of upside just to lock in meager gains. I'm a true retard.
Haven't seen Internet money this high since I started trading and bought the top. Was a rough introduction to investing, but fortunately I came here to learn about SPY calls.

Took VZ profits on shorter calls this morning and sold covered calls on my longs for next week, life is good time for a beer
When you exercise calls do you need to pay capital gains on that transaction or is it only if you sell the calls?

Who has info on DOCN. My pops keep telling me it‚Äôs a great stock, but I see *no* memes, so I have no clue what to believe‚Ä¶
Don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ just buy SPY puts or calls.  If you see a HUGE run on the Vix you can short it. But never buy calls
She bought the top in everything. Tesla has saved her ass
Amc and BB today? üëÅÔ∏è
stop trying to catch up, and start trying to be early. If you think the drop is coming, don't try to time that after chasing the top - just wait it out, and maybe try to go long again on the reversal. 

if you're playing options, get them much farther out - if you can't afford reasonable strike prices, open a spread - I know, capped profit, no moonshot, but its comfy - and you won't get fired for watching the charts all day like a meth addict, because you can check in a few times a day and not stress over every tick on the 1m chart. 

Take FB, its blown off its top pretty heavily, good bit of bad press recently - but that shit aint going anywhere - its 15% down in a month, and right now a january 365/370 bull call spread is under $1.00 - plenty of time to see that mature into a nice gain 

make surviving to trade another day your prime directive - its like marathon training, with enough running slow you eventually run fast

Relative Strength Index, it basically tells when a stock is overbought, oversold, or in a healthy area. 40-60 is the healthy area, and anything below or over that is in the oversold/overbought area, respectively. Continuing on, anything below 30 or over 70 is heavily oversold/overbought. *Usually* the stock pulls a reversal when in these areas.

People are expecting that to happen. Priced in. We close green, and go green majority of next week.
I'm buying 10/22 $450c at eod
Alright .. all the mega caps are green .. time to rip SPY!
thanks for the confirmation visualmod, all in on 0dte

what should i roll my $AA earnings into? $WGO, $STLD, $CLF?

$WGO is really interesting, short attack to reach max pain for opex today but the $150 million share buyback increase indicates good earnings.

If we can GUARANTEE that SPY is going to not budge from 446.5 for the rest of the day, what's the Theta-Gang way to profit from that fact?

=== ===== 

 An iron condor is an options strategy consisting of two puts (one long and one short) and two calls (one long and one short), and four strike prices, all with the same expiration date. The iron condor earns the maximum profit when the underlying asset closes between the middle strike prices at expiration. In other words, the goal is to profit from low volatility in the underlying asset.

The iron condor has a similar payoff as a regular condor spread, but uses both calls and puts instead of only calls or only puts. Both the condor and the iron condor are extensions of the butterfly spread and iron butterfly, respectively.
Alot of their earnings are next week. STLD,CSX,NUC
MSFT closing at 305 just cause
Oil and nat gas
At least once my SPY 450c expire I don't have to look at that red number anymore, it's been giving me anxiety.

RIOT had 5 million in volume in the first 30 minutes to run to 28.60 or so.  Another 8 million following that for two hours brought it down to 25.75. In the last 30 minutes its seen another 2 million in volume as corn went well of $60k.

&amp;#x200B;

Who in their right mind is selling while corn is on its tear?  Retailers?  Institutions?  Doubtful either.  I'm guessing its intraday shorts.

Might have been wrong on a $30 closing value today but I still think there's a chance to see over $29 as soon as the intra-day shorts close their positions.

Made 85% on msft calls bought at the bottom today
Because first u/zjz said he didn‚Äôt believe id go through with getting a butterfly tattoo on my foot. And then my bets weren‚Äôt good enough. Which is weird because disada‚Äôs bet is on there and he literally bet on my bet so if I lost we both lost and if I won we both won and I won. So then I placed another one on NTLA the next day from 122-130 and won that one it was on there but isn‚Äôt now because u/zjz didn‚Äôt believe I would actually get my foot tattooed if I lost which is false but also irrelevant because I won. He also removed my rblx bet that I wouldn‚Äôt have won because reading u/zjz a bedtime story wasn‚Äôt high stakes enough. But when I bet a tattoo twice he doesn‚Äôt believe I‚Äôll do it even though I have tattoos already.
I like farmer Jim the permabull
Oh that's cool, I use a boomer trading platform.
Does he have that tho? He just sound like he's spitting random thoughts on Twitter
Yeah, sound logic. 

How many people travel in cars daily vs planes? And how many people survive fender benders vs. free falls from miles up? What proportion of people survive car accidents vs the proportion of people who survive plane crashes? 

Planes crashing is *almost* unheard of... you know what is actually unheard of? Passengers surviving plane crashes from 30,000 feet. 

It's the risk. 

Traveling in planes is safer than traveling in cars. One of the reasons --- human fkn pilots. But if someone can hack into an oil company and cause a whole regional gas crisis how long until someone hacks an autonomous plane and point it's nose to the ground knowing a human can't intervene and take over manually? You think anyone is stepping foot on an autonomous plane after that happens one time? 

Planes are also practically autonomous as it is. Ever hear of auto pilot? Check it out sometime. 

Also, sure, traveling in planes is safer. Let me just hop on my jet in my driveway to go get groceries real quick because air travel is technically safer than traveling by car.

No the Fed is going to taper in November or December, I am just surprised people are still buying stocks and not selling them. I believe the economy is a lot weaker than we made to believe.

You seem like a white wine kinda guy
The ticker isn't reflecting the rise in the asset. I don't know how the difficulty level has been lately but it was cheap as fuk for them to Mine a few months ago, if they were smart enough to lock in gains on revenue while expenses were low they should have some solid earnings.
SPCE is taken.

SPCX could seem like a derivative of SPCE or something and might not even be allowed.

SPX is taken.

SPAC would be retarded.

SPAX is taken. 

I'm not joking about SpaceX listing as SEX at IPO, it seems easy for Elon to argue they have to let him do it because every other possible choice of ticker symbol is trash.
ahh bummer, what happened there?

CRSR investors be strong, a very hard day....
You have a good point.

My mother worked in advertising in the 60s, and the company reminds me of a very successful campaign she wrote for Levi's. She said it was all about making women's butts look really good.

Hospital work has a strange libidinal effect on the staff, perhaps something driving people to reproduce when they see so much death. So selling uniforms that make women look sexy sounds like such a perfect solution to an underserved problem.

Huh. My VIX calls from this morning have almost zeroed out my losses from soy puts yesterday. Buckle up, bumpy ride
Yes and No
This is what I just did lol. If you go on a big run and then lose some of your gains, might be perfect time to do it before you slide down on a losing streak
I actually called out the ocgn top yesterday at 10.70, I‚Äôm unreal. Now if I was smart I would‚Äôve made money off of it too.

They only take back the money in Quantitative Tightening, which we saw in 2018. This was being done at the same time as rate hikes. The Fed quickly reversed QT in Jan 2019 and stocks went back up. To answer your question as the Fed moves to start a taper you will have less money providing a bid for stocks. This means stocks will sell as there is less liquidity and you will also see an absence of buy the dip as there isn‚Äôt money there to buy the dip.
its up almost .55 cents just today!!!

VIX creepin
Sorry guys, i broke SPY. I bought +446C 0DTEs
How long to hold these puts? Got them An hour ago, expiring Wednesday, they‚Äôre up like 10%. SPY $440p

This RKT pump has bailed me out of my 10/22 16.5P that I sold about a month ago. 

Out for a small gain on the bottom end of my strangle and my calls on the top end of my strangle are still very far away.
Maybe chill with the options for now. I‚Äôve been there tho it sucks
The economy is in shambles
Huge green dildo on penn
This is 90% of us my guy. see ya soon. be safe out there
It‚Äôll move regardless on snap earnings. I went all in at 327 so hoping for something good

I'm tempted to buy VIAC calls, so cheap

if sofi could just rip above 20 that would make this a great friday
Maybe sell puts instead?
RKT baby just do $40 again
Ive lost 1000s on options... should i quit or try to regain

Don‚Äôt worry we‚Äôre trending up. Bounce after lunch and sell off before close
Keep feeding the Casino buddy, you‚Äôll hit big eventually
This fucking sucks. Every week, I make like 50% of my account on Monday, but I give like 10% back each day afterwards. So I end up breaking even for the week. And the only thing that saved me from going broke is that I had to withdraw money to pay bills.

In 2 weeks I‚Äôll get my bonus check and a paycheck. My credit card is payed off. I‚Äôll have like 4K to dump in the market. Until then, I‚Äôm wiped out. So depressed. 18k to nothing real quick.
Thanks for the info but lmfao your account is so big compare to mine. If the Fed supply the money why would the stock come back down if they're not taking back the said money that were used to pump the market?
I like when the guilt sweeper comes through too.
Need TSLA 860 EOD
CRSR had a ridiculous 2020 though.  It obviously couldn‚Äôt keep up and was overpriced.  Still up 46% in the 13 months after IPO.
When's FB the play? I'm thinking next Tuesday/Wednesday? Possibly this afternoon?
Remind me again, what was the bull case for CRSR? Always inverse WSB. It works 60% of the time all the time.

QE is temporarily. It‚Äôs purpose is to raise asset prices (homes, stocks, investments). But QE is coming to an end. This should bring down equity prices as it removes a buyer of stocks. The Fed doesn‚Äôt buy stocks but supplies money for other to buy stocks. I think many stocks will come back to reality but I am also not shorting anything right now. I have over 800K in cash just sitting in my account

We both made money on Tesla. I may just wait for the next QE bubble as that is where the money is made

üòÇ I had a number in mind and sold when I got to it. I‚Äôm diamond handing my spy puts tho
Why
&gt; A put is a financial contract between two parties, the buyer and the seller of this contract. The buyer of the put option has the right, but not an obligation to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a specified price (the strike price) by some time in the future.
The feeling when you go to an over hyped party and you get there and it‚Äôs dead with creepy people staring at you by the chip bowl, yea like that, today‚Äôs market high.

Unless you have at least $10M, you‚Äôre getting fucked by the current system.

There's no way it's hitting 500 by December
I'm curious how QQQ and AMZN can go vertical while the SPY (which is quite tech heavy) can stay roughly flat. Anyone know what's dropping? (Other than FB, which was a minor drop, not reaching its recent low and already recovering.)
Fine, I'll play tesla options

Organic just means it was grown without artificial pesticides/fertilizer
I'm adding yet more December DNA puts, for the third day running. It's now almost 20% of my account. I think what has happened here is that the massive OI in 10/15 puts decayed to nothing, hence the bump.  


The fact remains, though, that this company falsified its revenue. The short report checks out, and the CEO's only response to it was to post memes. Which means that he's hoping for retail fools to come save him, and knows that if he said anything of substance he would just reveal how accurate the report was. I doubt this will end well for that company.
If blackberry breaks 10.55 I will literally drink water

but I agree about the short term options fuckery
So not a good recovery stock atm I‚Äôm guessing
$DCT full earnings recovery
AMZN WTF!!! It‚Äôs going to have a +$150 day, huh??
Looks like it done for the day, could not bust through $16 and stick.
It is. 

It's 10% per month for 12 months in a row that's hard.
IV on VXX options has gone up
I remember a few years ago, right about this time, thinking "this is probably a good time to buy Amazon, with the holidays and all". It's up 400% since then, lol.

OK, I just checked. It was 2016, $750ish, so it's up 440%.

Moral of the story: buy more amzn
no. this thing is going to be a monster
Increased wages for workers and dogshit guidance plus supply chain issues. going to 24 hours operations tho and as long as nobody goes on strike it should recover a lil
We have trains that are autonomous, cars that are.......all thats left is boats and planes. I think with the supply chain crunch that eventually Trucks and shipping trucks will be self driving as well
And if I could time the exact top then I would have a lot more than 800k in my account. I am amazed stocks keep going up knowing they will come down on a taper and rate hike. This doesn‚Äôt even address the recession we have coming
There is some newbie investor who bought AMZN 0DTEs thinking "STONKS ONLY GO UP" and is up 10,000%
God dammit

I wish I had that gain :(
Always, calls biweekly, puts on green. Just 19.5 is a sus play.
They are not gonna be able to hire the 2,000,000 workers they need for holidays lol
Who‚Äôs buying so much AMZN
Playing stocks is way easier than winning shoes Jesus fucking Christ

I think BJ‚Äôs are appropriately valued usually but on some corners they just want to charge an arm and a leg I don‚Äôt get it

This wasn‚Äôt the case in 2018. Market fell 7 percent after a rate hike in September. Interest rates will have to be raised and QE is going to stop. Stock valuations won‚Äôt hold.
&gt; I think it is a good company. I like the way they treat their employees and customers. They have great products at reasonable prices, and they are expanding into new markets.
My best decision today closing AMZN short calls for 10% loss.

im still waiting on the cyber van. 

I would like a van I can take a poop in, sleep in, and also bullet proof.

I dont trust the woods people around Portland OR
Only $100 for the Xbox mini fridge? Wtf
I got over 800k in cash. Pretty sure I‚Äôll be fine. And yes, theory is important as QE is the only think keeping this market up
I agree, there is nothing more pathetic than those simps in the RKT sub.
Nah 305c 10/29 for earnings. Sold yesterday made 30% and bought back again when it dipped. Then dipped more so averaged down.

Hoping it reverses today but idk. And I hope theta doesn't fuck me over the weekend.

IV has been going down all week, was wondering when it would start going up due to earnings.
Amazon please split
Papa bezoz saving my broke ass
You fucked up your format - you want **!banbet SPY +2% 1d** or **!banbet SPY 500 1w** or **!banbet GME 0 1d I'll eat a bar of soap**
no chips and no ships
23andME on fire üî• ‚Ä¶
Probably to make a banbet or gtfo
The P/E is rich for TSLA but that's because of retail investors seeing its potential and we're definitely in a housing bubble. Everything costs "20 percent more" due to FED printing money.

CRSR and CLOV are the worst meme stonks
Yeah my company got hit two weeks ago. Fucking assholes
Look into that telluride. Pretty popular SUV at least around me and not that cheap.
UMich Sentiment Slumps To Second-Lowest Since 2011, Inflation Expectations Spike, prob nothing.
What do you think they‚Äôll decide? I think they‚Äôll fuck us over tbh
[deleted]
oh man you think the market follows books and theories. you're doomed my man.
maybe the fact there's been no gains for a year and a half, a rocket upwards like last year is bound to happen at some point
It crashed landed
Allot of resistance at $16.00.  :(
Prog with all the good news but with 61% SI. The manipulation definition
Selling to early buying in to late. Gotta love it!
This is the beginning of the Santa rally. Better late than never. Buying todays winners is the move imo.
Could have bought 100 AMZN $3400c for $0.04 this morning and made a quick $50k.
That definitely counts as illegal shit lol
how much gas do you want yesterday's close isnt even on todays chart!?
Why‚Äôs CRSR down?
Im in fam, shut up and take my money
Bezos fixed the lazy eye and can now see the way
so the idea is Inflation is now permanent .. 

but that means also corporate profits are going to be inflated too.

I should of bought more that last dip, we are never going to see SPY 430 again.
yeah i was like do i fomo back into those 3330c?
Read about one of their accountants that got caught insider trading. Had her husband making retarded prior to earnings. Wish my wife worked for AMZN. Instead she's just got boring Boomer company that always gets downgraded.

Just admit to yourself that you like money more than this gay earth
Optimism about upcoming earnings.
There's always some big bad boogeyman hiding in the closet.

I successfully bought the Wed lows, but paper handed it and bailed within an hour.   Only to watch it never downtick again.  This market is jacked up with free money.
Tesla being $833 a share is wild.
PLTR, sometimes maybe good sometimes maybe shit! But mostly shit
Buy further dated options, give yourself some more time to be right. Average down if needed.

plus they dont pay anything to hold them, fuk u mang pay me to hold.
Historically look for volatility to increase in the week after OPEX, and due to the large amount of gamma expiring today (&gt;30%)  look for ample reason for caution into Monday. FYI
Not time-relevant, but how sweet of you to help &lt;3
Doubt it. Stocks won‚Äôt keep going up as the Fed quits printing trillions of dollars.
BB getting hot
And right after I decided to start buying options on Spy. The first one was not free üòë
So who's paying for the WSB retreat after all this fckn $$ we're making today? It's the fckn Catalina Wine Mixer!!!
I think a lot of ppl don't realize the stonk market always looks like it's about to tank. There's never a safe time to invest.
VIX dying way too fast. That IMO is a sign of bulls making the same mistake over and over again; abandoning all hedges and ripping into calls/being short Vix. TNX also ripping. Bad news for bulls. I think we ultimately get another bear trap before we hit the gas
NVAX made my butthole bleed. How's everyone else's day going?
Those are the calls I was watching, only can blame myself ü§°
I‚Äôve literally done that in my Tesla. Lol
wtf my AMZN calls are up randomly 100% is there any news?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Wtf, guess we gonna keep ripping
Did u/cashflow_ go broke? He was doing so well
Wow Tsla behaving like a beast today!
Oh no it‚Äôs so morally corrupt to invest in green energy options because their company is from (insert enemy of US empire)
NYSE needs a maximum price that shares can be before forced being split. Change my mind. 

I‚Äôm looking at you CMG, AMZN
fucking piece of shit , red while market is flying and drill to earth core harder than anyone else during pull back.
uh are your calls not printing?
You never go broke taking a profit.
It‚Äôs setting up for a rug pull right‚Ä¶? Right?
Ransomware attacks.
I‚Äôm trying!!
That is exactly what it is!  Rebalancing.
Me too.  Still holding shares I bought for $18 as well as $42.  What a wild average.
[deleted]
Exited calls and going cash gang for next week. Just seems like the market is setting up a trap.
My average price is $31, which is pretty low. 

The only thing that sucks about that is that I never know which dips to buy.
You prefer licking dicks
Yo wtf happened to Virgin's Galactica?
arent they a chinese coin stock?
I keep thinking it's too late to jump in and it just keeps rocketing goddamn it

Hold
Terrible idea.
AMZN calls were cheaper than SPY (3350C was $0.25 now $25 damn 100x bagger)
Selling KOS calls, buying gf
It‚Äôs not against the law to be mean to your own mother either. But it sure is the wrong thing to do.

Oh yes, communists are famous for their avid love of the stock market lol
Yeah idk what's going on but it'll come back next week 


Hopefully they aren't 0dte...
lol you're gonna be in for a rude awakening when QE stops and stonks go on a moon mission.
The sourness I feel knowing I caved and sold my calls at the literal bottom on Wed for puts after being hammered by mms for 3 days straight...only for it to go on a massive bull run with zero pullback my lord how am I so bad at this
&gt; I don't know. I'm not a tootsie pop expert.
seriously what the absolute fuck amzn
Nothing like a 100% day to reverse several days of absolutely dumb plays

Everything green for me except PLTR. What a dumb stock.

Wait for QE to end. Then it will really be on sale

Sex trafficked his cheerleaders? If that‚Äôs true I‚Äôm sure he will get epstiens old jail cell, the one without the cameras‚Ä¶.
No. Tesla grew some but not enough to justify a 15x move in a year, that‚Äôs QE. You see the effects in QE on home prices, or do you believe a home is worth 20 percent more than last year just because
What the hell did they do
Somebody said Pelosi about to go all in on AMZN calls.üòÇ

How come Russia accepts it but not China? Russia must be doing a bunch more illegal shit to have to pay with crapto lmaooooooooo
I was watching this dude on YouTube the other day who was talking about a bullish pattern and how Wednesday was the day to get in and how the longer you wait to jump in the more risk you take, I usually watch videos like that and basically forget about em the next trading day but man was he right.

He bought some low strike puts that‚Äôs probably worthless by now, only couple hundred thousand in cost, but number of underlying shares worth a million by todays share price not the actual strike, just bunch of fud articles that he liked since it supported his case and drove fear but now his trying to be open about it thats its only hundreds in cost never millions

Tsla saw massive growth in comparison to other companies. Even if QE had a helping hand, it's not a solo reason for it's trading price.
$ITCI is a hidden gem.  I've been long for a long time, and continue to add more.  Big FDA announcement in December should put shares up to the moon!!  Just my opinion, of course -- you should check it out and get shares while they are cheap.  Good luck, longs!!
Why the fuck are our taxes so confusing? Trying to figure out how much I owe the IRS using their own goddamn calculator and it basically told me ‚Äúü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, sorry bro, idk‚Äù
I guess Amazon is a penny stock now.
Amazon does not make money on retail.  AWS is the tent pole.  Actual retail margins hit below 3% or something stupid when you take out AWS profit.
All you ü§° that like the low float deSPACs should take a look at GWH. I'm not saying this is the YOLO your life away play, but it Can totally ramp up to close the day, and if you've got an iq over 85 you can switch to Puts next week. 

Anyhow, these people are making batteries in storage containers using iron and salt instead of Lithium. Gonna change the future, clean up the water, protect the polar bears,  all that shit. Grab some calls, grab some shares and see what happens.
What‚Äôs happening to amazon? My options went from -80% to up 120%

I'm a TSLA bear (very very long-term) and even I can see that Burry is likely fucked if he expects a major correction anywhere before the next couple years.

TSLA's weaknesses will only become apparent when it tries to convert it's growth into hard cash and reaches a much more mature stage of the company.

Until then it's going to behave like a miracle growth company.

Alright, just got notification that it was up, but it is now back down. Gonna have to get out of these calls for 3 baggers I'm thinking instead of the 10 baggers I was hoping for.
Can you really do better than, say, a basket of 5 dividend aristocrats?  Say, JNJ, EMR, PG, PPG, MMM.  You'll get a 3% dividend yield plus price appreciation that beats the market and no chance of a rug pull.  

Throw me some tickers where you can make a constant 8% selling covered calls, I'm curious now.

The stock just wasn‚Äôt moving and even though I expected it to move eventually it had been dipping below 7.50 for weeks and never rising above 8 so if I was just expecting it to expire out of the money, and it was out of the money until yesterday after hours.

No it isn't, it's ridiculous to deploy huge amounts of capital for capped return.  The minute this stock you spent all that money to buy starts to moon, you lose out on the upside.  A covered call is what you do when your good company turns to shit and you can't sell it for what you'd like; so you earn a small premium for *not* being able to sell it for what you'd like, while "risking" the chance that you get to sell it for what you'd like.

If you enter a trade intending to sell covered calls, you might as well go get your CLU license.

Yes. but you wouldn't have been making 'hundreds' anyway. If it closes in the 9.30s, you would have been up $130ish.

Why did you sell the 7.50c? Just looking at the chart now, it hasn't been below that since... ever.
I‚Äôm up $10 today and I thought today may be the day my account blows up for good, so I guess there‚Äôs that‚Ä¶

I think we touch $446.5-447 on SPY today then dump to $444.5 by end of day

/u/Amroj1234 made a bet that SPY would go to 380.0 when it was 444.54 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Between this and the buy now pay later companies we seem to wanna do 2008 again.

Steel could do very well over the next few weeks
Unfortunately i tried to warn you guys on Corsair. I am in the global electronics and chip manufacturing business. the one time I thought I could help everyone !  :

Shares of Corsair Gaming, Inc. (CRSR) declined 7% in Thursday‚Äôs extended trading session after the company revealed that it expects to report Q3 net revenues of $391 million, much lower than the Street‚Äôs expectations of $485.2 million.  
  
Corsair develops and manufactures high-performance gear and technology for gamers, content creators, and PC enthusiasts. (See Corsair stock charts on TipRanks)  
  
The company said that the key reasons behind the poor revenue guidance are global logistics and supply chain issues, especially the lack of affordable GPUs in the retail channel. Corsair expects this to have impacted revenues by about 10%.
Nothing will make me more happy then when this bubble pops.
I always hold until they expire worthless
See you next week üêÇüî´

No, because I‚Äôll still be in even if it goes sub $17, and by then you would want it to go back up wouldn‚Äôt you?

Upstart is up 20x from its December 2020 ipo. Yes, Burry is right. This is a giant bubble
Up
yes, i mean a 6.96% return in two weeks, if replicated over a long term, would put you in the realm of mythical fund managers

I know that its not very cash money of me to point out but double digit returns over a year are considered 'winning'

Should I offload these 10/29 SPY 459c while I can? Or does SPY have more juice
Free money is free money. You should realistically only be making 5% or less on your trades if you're just starting out because experience plays such a large factor.

Oh i totally agree but this particular pump is absolutely a pnd.  Ill buy back when when we go back down sub 17.
Hey üåàüêª... the bulls send their regards.
short upst for a quick scalp if it hits 400?
2 green days in a row?  That's illegal.
Bears be patient.  It‚Äôs coming.
Have you guys ever considered that there's a secret theta gang within theta gang who have insider help guaranteeing they don't get assigned on their shit before expiration day and they do all kinds of price manipulation just dicking around while they wait for opex but then they have to move prices back to where the contracts they sold are OTM by expiry
I made $466 profit on my $10000 last week and $230 profit this week on my $10466.  I mean profit is profit, right guys?
Question for those more experienced than I. If I sold a $ME 7.5c that expires today for .60 and I paid $8 for the stock once it gets assigned today I will make $10 instead of the hundreds of dollars I would have made if I had not have sold the call. Because this means I have to sell 100 shares of the stock for 7.5 instead of the 8 I paid for it. I just want to make sure I understand this correctly.
got out of upst fucking insane stonk
All the motley fool stocks are going higher because the people that have $100 to waste on that subscription also have the money to put into stocks nonstop. (Net,upst,band,fsly,ddog,fvrr)

Might be an issue? Do you mean supply? My hypothesis is that demand will never stop accelerating and even though supply will be an issue the cost will match it. Do you think that the supply will hinder growth for the companies themselves?

I don't think trump actually wants to be president again, I think he just wants to remain relevant and powerful.  I don't think he even really \~wanted\~ to be president the first time around, as evidenced by his lack of actual "presidenting" and behavior with the media and socials.  He just wants approval.

people just don't want to give their lives to companies anymore.  simple as that. Yes we all need to work because money is necessary to survive, but people are starting to come around to the idea that the human purpose is not to sacrifice themselves for corporate profit.  My goal when I wake up in the morning is not to help my employer be as profitable as possible, it is to obtain the maximum amount of happiness and joy from the little amount of time i have here on this earth.  I trade some of my time for money in pursuit of that goal, but there is a limit.

One of the most interesting things about all these labor strikes going on is that it has been near universal that a primary complaint by the unions has revolved around mandatory/excess overtime.  Wages have been involved but the wage demands and increases really aren't that significant in the overall picture considering most seem to be taking relatively smaller raises compared to inflation and what you would expect labor could demand.

Kellogg's workers don't like the excess Overtime, Frito workers wanted overtime pulled back, and John Deere  just went on strike with overtime limitations being one of their clear goals.

Also why the hell do you let workers go on strike when you are so desperate for production that you are forcing people to work 60+ hours a week endlessly ü§£

Hope you bought Platinum after this mornings dip.  Auto manufacturers are screwed!  China is doubling down on hybrid vehicles to replace diesel.  Hybrid require double the platinum.  EV batteries require more platinum than palladium.  Palladium only crushed platinum and reversed because of the Volkswagon scandal which created an abnormal oversupply from 2015-2018.  Platinum is back into a deficit and manufacturers will chose Platinum over palladium due to price pressure creating a massive deficit in supply.

# LTH (Life Time Holdings Inc.) 

recently IPO'd at a valuation of around $2.78 Billion, with a share value of $18. It's currently trading at $17.62 per share, currently not optionable.

The company is on track for a $345 Million in EBITDA next year based on post covid membership rates, giving an enterprise multiple of 14. Planet Fitness has an enterprise multiple of 27, making it the cheaper of the two fitness stocks. If it were to match up to meet Planet Fitness' multiple, it would have a share price of $34, or 92% upside.

The company focuses on higher end fitness facilities and "resort" style amenities for customers. Middle class and wealthier people have generally identified that fitness is of particular importance based on the recent trends with Peloton and other at-home equipment. However, those aren't particularly "sticky" in terms of consistent customer usage and growth. People *want* to get out of the house, and they need more than one single exercise to keep interested. Planet Fitness has already priced in future years' assumed growth, but LTH has not.

Going to be watching level 2 data today to get into 1000 shares by EOD as it is trading below IPO price.

"For starters, anyone who is thinking of how to start an ETF needs to realize that this is a big-ticket wish: starting an ETF requires upwards of $100,000, up to a few million dollars of seed money in order to kick off the fund."

We can make a WSB ETF that holds the tickers most discussed in the last 3 days. Since this group of apes only pumps stocks which are soon to die, we can also make an inverse WSB ETF.

Money for everyone.

VIX calls
That‚Äôs right more than half of the time.

No. Look at their float. It would take enormous buys or a buy back to move it.

You fucked yourself when you bought in. I might grab some under 20
I don‚Äôt know if I would hold over the weekend tho, definitely money to be made in calls today

$400 is a stretch for today but the way that stock has been hitting new ATH's daily, it's definitely possible. Buyers stepping up..

Thinking spy calls is the play. But I also think that like literally every 4 out of 5 days.
PENN looking like it might have another big day. Confirmation of breakout out of that wedge plus good news/acquisition of a profitable company with big market share has made me feel confident it's going to head back towards it's highs from last year. Still way too discounted
No, not this time. This is a completely different situation than any other time.

1. Information you receive before/during trading hours is probably the wrong thing to do.
2. Information you receive after after hours is probably correct, because it's too late to do anything about it.

China has been working in Afghanistan for the past 20 years to scout for minerals. Laughing they are going to make 3Trillion in a few years vs the US spending 3T
I'm guessing it's a little bit of over valued , they rocketed hard last year, and a little bit of uncertainty with the current Taiwan , China conflict, with a dash of ongoing shortages even though they're building more facilities. it's definitely a long term play. I don't really see it popping for any reason, but playing between $108-$110 and $120's is pretty easy.

The chip shortage grabs the headline, but there is a big shortage of nonhuman primates for animal testing used in biopharma.  China supplies the US with &gt;60% of all monkeys used in testing.  The shortage of primates now delays the development of many types of US biotech for upwards of over 1+ years, and the shortage is getting worse.  China could clamp down on shipping monkeys to the US and US pharma would be fucked.  They'll keep all of the monkeys themselves for their own biotech. US won't be able to develop a ton of life saving therapies if China fucks w/ the supply chain for monkeys.

It'd be so funny to go all out and fake a "short squeeze" on Amazon. Get it trending to the point of being all over the news, while buying puts for when boomers panic sell. Would be the best prank of all time, and the sheer ridiculousness of people actually believing WSB is going up against a company that large would make it even better.

Came back down to earth (but never left)
SPCE is probably a good buy if you wanna hold the hoe for long, shit is cheap now obviously
"As quickly as possible" = in the next millennium
Yesterday's move felt like the kind of move that happens at the end of pullbacks, and it was accompanied by strong earnings reports as earning season started the past 2 days.

This is probably the point where you abandon puts and start buying dips (or keep buying dips if you already were), at least until we get closer to the November 2-3 Fed meeting.

Main reason yesterday's move was so bullish is that the market leaders approached or broke through new ATHs or closed their pullback gaps: GOOG, MSFT, CRM among big caps and of course UPST, AMBA, PANW and others among smaller caps.

TSLA showing tons of momentum the past couple days and basically just looks like it's set to challenge all time highs.

I'd expect some form of market rotation later in the year as we start getting to tapering (small co's look like they need to breakout at some point) and the tech stocks experience some kind of a mini-blowoff top, but for now market just looks set to get to all time highs especially with lots of stocks reacting well to earning beats so far.  Tons of money chasing momentum stocks makes it hard to believe we're still in pullback mode.

Insanely high share float (4.64B) means that even good news leads to paltry price action.

Thank you I hadn't checked their chart lately, I'll be buying today!
They have no idea that you are 100% correct and that the mechanism that causes a drop in prices around opex is large call volume. MMs don‚Äôt control the market but they can move it and they rally have to in an effort to remain delta neutral. When call volume surges they make the market by completing the order but have to buy the underlying shares in some quantity related likelihood of reaching the strike price by expiration. 

When out volume goes high they have to complete the transactions (make the market) and sell short to remain delta neutral. As those puts expire move towards expiring worthless they buy back their short position which is buy volume. 

When call volume is higher than put volume, opex will generally create a sell pressure on equities, when put volume is higher than call volume it will generally result in buying pressure.

The bears buying short OTM puts are literally sending the market up this week and they have no idea why!
Fuck it

Daily reminder that Jim Cramer called the top in oil 3 days ago and it has done nothing but go up since
buying an opening dip during the first few minutes is bad I think? Usually the call option loses a fraction of its value within a few more minutes. Maybe it's IV loss

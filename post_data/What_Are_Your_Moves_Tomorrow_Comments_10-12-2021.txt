Not many retail traders are trading naked afaik. Don't think many brokerages make that mistake.

But I don't need naked options to lose money. I have short-term calls.
Test 4340 before pre-market, back up to 435 at open on an uptrend, rip like mad, bear trap at noon, rip some more at 2pm, little sell-off EOD, and I'll see you all back here for our regularly scheduled ribbing and bickering

It does when they need a US trial to get it and they haven’t even started one yet.

You could sit on cash and wait for the correction.
It’s the only alcohol that’s also a stimulant
Well.

It’s pumping on hype that WHO should approve Covaxin and news that India approved the vaccine for children.

Problem is that OCGN only has rights to distribute in North America.  US FDA has already stated they will not give Covaxin EUA but they need to go through BLA which will take years, so this news means fuck all for the company.

Add in the fact that the last two times this pumped the company did a direct offering that fucked it all up and then led to a crash.

I would stay far far away, but you do you.
They got some sort of approval. Read about it on stocktwits. Was gonna buy calls at close but they never filled. Fml
WHO approval this week and India just approved covaxin in children as young as 2 years old
At least everyone is getting some 🤷‍♀️
If you believe in volatility you can put some money in strangles. I did lately and earned a 130% gain in two weeks :)

I’m going to see if it dips some today but I’m going in on some long calls. Let’s do this brother ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
I’ll be buying calls on Reddit at ipo for sure
BABA makes more money than some of the trillion dollar companies… reasonably we could see the price in the thousands in the long term. Plus China is going up in general, while we’re crumbling in America.
It's hilarious that once Gen z wakes up that stock market goes up. Those guys literally do not give a fuck. They don't have enough money to change things yet but just wait
Why are you sooo sure that CPI will be bad?
Because I didn’t have the money. Unfortunately
Lots of cargo containers are stuck empty in places that don't export much so no one wants to pay to ship them anywhere.
LOL I just need someone to reassure me I’m not a dumb ass. But I will look Into it! I’m smoking a pretty strong indica strand, but my anxiousness is outweighing it all. I’m basically dead tired but do not have the ability to sleep.
Bulls before CPI: cocky

Bulls after CPI: cockless and poor

Yes, yes we can.

Too many bag holder from the previous P&amp;Ds for this to get any traction considering WHO approval still does jack shit for them making money.
Always 🚀
Lol
Lol 160 is still an epic buying point
It’s a good buy as long as it’s under fair value. Fair value is 350 right now, will be over 400 after the coming earnings beats. There’s your answer
It has been 0️⃣ days since ber r fuk
Japan is perfect that time of year , good weather, not too crowded

Try listening to a podcast. “Stuff you should know” is good. Shows about any interest
Me too! 1:52am pacific time and I can’t asleep 😴
Keep on prayin. Us real China bulls would love a chance to load in the 130s again on baba. Maybe Weiss and soros can blow up their accounts shorting China to give us that gift
No, why weren’t you buying last week?
This is the way. Inverse majority of wsb has always been the profitable play.
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/R3dditkeepsbanningme made a bet that SPY would go to 432.15479999999997 when it was 436.52 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Guys! Is Baba a good buy today?

i took a nap earlier and now i’m awake 🥲
that's how I would describe it
I guess I’m learning now not to panic sell. Breaking even is a good feeling
Wait wait, I thoughts bulls wer fukt???

What's going on???
Covid is one reason (we are comping over some deflation) and relations between us and China also.
&gt; In pre-1980s reform China, the socialist state fulfilled the needs of society from cradle to grave. Child care, education, job placement, housing, subsistence, health care, and elder care

&gt; Welfare reforms since the late 1990s have included unemployment insurance, medical insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, maternity benefits, communal pension funds, individual pension accounts, universal health care.

Sound familiar? Literally all the shit we have here in the US, at least the Chinese call themselves communists. We try to act like we’re a country based on the free market but that really hasn’t been the case for a hundred years.
Comes down to a lack of giving a fuck from a tired deteriorating middle class that doesn’t want to work for scraps anymore for the elite while things keep getting worse and worse for the common man while the rich get richer.
SQ trying to make a move…
I literally accidentally became a weed dealer for awhile because I was buying in bulk for myself to save money and all my co-workers constantly wanted grams, maybe eighths. I started selling just as a favor then suddenly was having all my smoke paid for just by selling small quantities on work breaks. Good times.
Do the supply chain issues really just boil down to lack of truck drivers and port workers?

Oh don’t the CPI numbers come out today? That’s definitely the reason for the futures sell off.
you are the human equivalent of a participation award
OCGN is flying
Oh ouch approval in 2+ literally just happened. I told you so.
Yep. Anything under 250 is a sizable discount for long term. 140 was just asinine. Wasn’t possible to go that low without illegal collusion from Wall Street, but hey what else is new. Those guys get away with everything since we don’t have a real president like Xi to throw the bad guys in jail. They too busy throwing petty criminals into jail so they have a nice supply of African American slaves in the for profit prison system america has. So woke

Step 1: Buy as many pounds of weed as money you have 

Step 2: Apply for tons of jobs

Step 3: go to the jobs and sell your coworkers weed. Once everyone is buying from you, quit. Ideally you’d have multiple part time jobs

Step 4: repeat this until you have a large customer base

Step 5: profit. You’re the weed man now… congratulations.

A winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, Paul Krugman wrote in 1998, “The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in ‘Metcalfe’s law’—which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants—becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”

The "responsible" people don't really have any idea.  They just have strong verbal skills, which many mistake for credibility.

For now yes yes. Im rlly betting on some random Xi Jinoing talk to send it back down honestly else i wouldnt sell. have 12/22 180 for 23.25 originally bought at the first gap down of 158. It was 27.50 today bc i was literally the only seller. Bought it back 140$ cheaper. 

And you know its intrinsic value so yoyre only buying it back cheaper right?

Funny you should mention that because that's exactly what happened with the Vancouver stock exchange in 1982. The software that calculated the index (like SPY) was truncating its calculations to 3 decimal places and dropping the rest instead of rounding so the index kept dropping for 2 years even when all the stocks were going up and nobody knew why. Ultimately they figured it out, and reset the index value before putting the new system in place.

Yes, I did. Proof below. You should totally bet that PLTR be going to $16! You seem to be really convinced! 

This is in my fast trade $10k acct that I have had for 8 months. I am not rich, so I am rarely risking more than a few k per trade. I’m up $183 on PLTR all time, made money off the 10/4 buys.

I had a dream the other night where Satan unleashed 3 invincible dragons from the void, and they were kind of like Monster Zero from Godzilla. The only way they could be defeated were if I ate them.

Wrong the United States has the power to compel certain s standards in health care facilities. I am required to get tested for TB yearly, I had to get Hep B vaccines and chicken pox vaccines to get into nursing school. If you are infected with an infectious case of TB the government has the legal authority to compel you to comply with the medication regimen. Challenge it in court if you don’t like it but there is standing to require it in healthcare facilities.
This reminds me of a time where teachers and doctors were payed per child prescribed adhd medicine. Like y’all gave your kids meth and everybody turned a blind eye, so no don’t trust them for shit.
Sucks, yeah I haven't really heard anything good about it.  I'll probably just wait till it's out on EA Play/Game Pass Ultimate.
Nope. I'm asking why would a stock stop trading before traditional close
It has nothing to do with politics, you’re no fucking hero for a fucking vaccine, a virus so deadly you need to be tested to see if you even have it and a vaccine so great the government has to threaten you to take it. It’s a joke really, never got the flu vaccine and I also contribute me not taking medicine or these unnecessary vaccines to fight whatever virus is in my system. You should just take care of yourself and fight as long as you can because when you’re older it’ll catch up to you with all this shit you got pumped in your body.

How tf does this comment make or lose anyone money. You know what this subs for right? Also its called herd immunity. Every cunt who doesnt get vaccinated equates to more chances of mutations for the virus. And people who have organ transplants the vaccine doesnt work for, so the longer we have covid spreading from unvaccinated people creating stronger variants, the more avoidable deaths we will have. Hence why we dont have measles and polio anymore. Know who enstated the first vaccine mandate for the military? Washington. Know it was highly unpopular since it was a new and scary technology? Know that its the only reason we won the revolution? Because we innoculated against smallpox and the british didnt?  But keep bein a selfish asshole when its a proven safe vaccine.

Everyone thinks the market is going down tomorrow so it's going to go up instead. That's how this works.

You made a really short custom ban bet (None) which was not accepted.
Don't put any text after the time token (1m, 1w, 15d) if you don't intend to carry out an interesting punishment to get unbanned early.
With the new banbet system and wsb success track record of winning, this place will be empty in a few weeks.
🥲
!banbet what did I bet?
I love how media makes up market sentiment

OMG AUGUST GOOD TIMES FOR STOCKS ALL TIME HIGH EVERYONE HAPPY

OMG SEPTEMBER BAD MONTH EVERYTHING GONNA CRASH EVERYONE SCARED

OMG FIRST HALF OF OCTOBER STILL BAD EVERYONE STILL SO SCARED

OMG SECOND HALF OF OCTOBER GOOD TIME EVERYONE MORE POSITIVE THINKING

OMG END OF YEAR RALLY EVERYONE BUY

$AA calls for earnings on the 14th 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Since no one wants to work there's nobody to process them. So what they do with the excess turkeys is they lock them in the barn close all the windows and turn off the fans until they suffocate to death then throw them in the trash.

Nurse here... lol nursing shortage has forever been a problem the mandate only made is slightly worse. Most of the healthcare people who were fired for no vax were non clinical like housekeeping. 

However it is dumb as fuck to make healthcare get a vaccine when it doesn’t stop transmission. I’m vaccinated but government are the ones who will have to continue to shell out insane money to travel nurses due to furthering the shortage. My salary went from 100k to 275k in 2020 and 2021...

I’ll bang her right now, no losing weight

You think they didnt know better? They work in the health field, get emails on the daily about covid and regulations, and btw they worked the entire 2 prior years without the vax.  If this is the apocalypse plague they make it out to be , how could they afford to lose a single nurse?
Serious shrinkage

Isn't the point of a pixel for it to be cheaper than iPhones with similar specs?  Gonna stick with my 3A.
Thats what i wanted to hear for the calls i bought EOD 😎
China is waiting until our resources, manufacturing, and  means of production, like labor force, is all time low before they strike
You’re right. But god damn I don’t like it. Make him apologize and take some bs sensitivity training and put him on a last and final warning.
Bruh
Just snuffed that pb &amp; j 

...shouldn't of done it
Cold Canadian night sounds miserable
If you're afraid of jabs you can get the shitty J&amp;J single stick.
If you dont happen to be there when it’s posted u miss the results. Would be nice be able to always see/reference who made bets and what happened. Like a list of past bets like the list of current ones. At least for the past week
You’ll be short the 100 shares and will need to exercise the long call (or cover at market which will be for a loss most likely) &amp;you basically forfeited the time value of your LEAP
My parents already died and fucked the family lol. Im the most literate by far. It’s an ugly situation over here
The nurses shortage has been being talked about for a while even pre-covid. That being said glad we are taking out the trash....
It’s a pretty shitty stock bro. I’m retarded enough to buy it not shill it
She pegged me. Despite my protests, she knew I wouldn’t put up a fight. That’s what love was, on a cold Canadian night discovering each other’s bodies by the fire.
Green by open then a dump again in the last half hour. It’s predictable now
I want to know what possessed you to buy baba calls
Lol my dude still going here... Proving my point
great another day bntx and mrna bout to go down some more
Market is down because you bought calls
Why?

So if this LUV walkout turmoil hits other sectors and continues thru the holidays, it’ll be a bear market to say the least.  The media is trying to crush the story, but word is spreading fast.
I wanted an asset I had some confidence in that I could sell CCs to build up a smaller IRA, but you’re right, if they get called I’ll just sell a CSP and get them back in a week or two
Yes sir. Ber is fuk
it had its ups and downs.
elon is literally the only exception to this rule
Baba calls anyone??
That’s great I wouldn’t suggest that you do. There are many of us that are balls deep in WISH losses such as my dad. This is just hopium
Yeah at least for a few years
That's optimistic
I won’t bet against burry. He may be 🌈🐻 asf.  But I’m not smarter than him.
SPY puts Friday because the S&amp;P always goes down every 16th to the 19th of every month going back to March 2021? Or VXX calls??

You fucking loser.
The ones who get defensive and start rattling off shit like old numbers 🤦🏻‍♂️... 

You made the joke initially, my dude, why get defensive about it now then?. Looks like you need to eat the own words of your initial point and take a joke instead of trying to intimidate someone over the internet. Learn to take a joke you crybaby boomer exjock. And then maybe everyone else will be able to to.

The shit being said about other cultures are worse than the guy saying he couldn't not picture you getting beat up. So if you can't handle that... Why should anyone else have to put up with worse. ✌️

Ignorant fucktard
But if the leap is also itm and weekly call was  5-10% otm but now expires itm. Does  it let you buy the shares to sell to the weekly call and then you keep the share difference.
I mean my parents apparently couldn’t figure out life insurance either so it makes since I’m worthless lol
I did
Lol yes, typo. 437.
It doesn’t force you to exercise the leap, you’ll have to likely exercise it yourself. Hopefully your broker isn’t shitty and liquidate something else, but don’t take that chance and if you know you’re getting assigned then speak with your broker immediately or exercise that shit
proof that we need a gob ive made a huge mistake emoji.

The worms isn't the problem. You probably have food poisoning and are drained of electrolytes from your diarrhea. You need to hydrate, and I don't mean just water. Get some gatorade power and mix it and drink that shit. If you don't have that then chug some gatorade, not too much tho cuz there's quite a bit of sugar. Stay on bland foods for a few days and you'll be fine

Therefore, if you want to appreciate how good or amazing the good things are, you gotta know what the bad things are and how ugly it is. Relativity is important when you wanna talk about how "good" or "bad" something is, so those people are just showing you what the bad is, then you'll know how good the good is lol

Addendum "Market adjusted price. 10k Additional. Total 60k" 

Customer comes in and goes "Im not paying that. Thats bull shit" Then you say "Well you dont have to, Since we arnt going to agree on price a test drive doesnt seem necessary" and all the sudden they are like "oh fuck hes serious". 

Or you tell them to go try and find another one not at sticker less then 3 states away. They might leave and come back 2 days later like "Okay... instead of 10k over sticker lets do 7k over sticker and Ill take the car today"

Or you have people who will just open a loan on anything and if they get approved they dont give a fuck what that payment is.

Hey, some of us poor's don't have loss porn worthy of posting. I lost 6 grand, big woop. But, that was my last 6 grand... Down to 186 dollars now lol. If my deep OTM PTRA December calls down print, I have to pray to the SPY fd god's to get me back on my feet

Less than 700 in their last fiscal year for fake braces

You should mention if you're shifting gears from pumping fake braces to another stock

I'm bullish on TDOC though

TSLA retards are trying to engineer a gamma squeeze by buying calls. However they are selling puts to fund the calls. Lol

Bears are celebrating now, but remember February-March earlier this year and September-October last year?  Lots of noise on how it was the beginning of the end, but they just ended up being fantastic buying opportunities (not for FDs obviously).  Yeah, it's painful now, but a month later you're going to have cash gang bitching again about how there are no dips to buy (conveniently forgetting that they failed to buy the previous dips).

I disagree. A sack of shit at least has monetary value and a purpose, unlike CLOV.
In a specific girl- means she likes you and her friends want the inside scoop for her—-
Girls in general- idk just means they are just curious
Looking into TDOC, any insights? 🤔

There’s a ton of long term expiration puts with 100%+ volatility that, even after 2 years and the stock going to zero, they still wouldn’t break even.

If they were going to this season they would've by now. They get two shots a year because of how turbulent the channel is there. October and April. We've probably got another six months before we have to check in again, and the biggest risk is next October, before Xi has to get re-elected by the CCP.

If all goes well it’ll have a 96% profit margin on 16 billion in revenue by 2030. 1000 per share would literally, not be a meme
When you have intense fear about something, like at work, a trade that might go south etc.

Kinda counterintuitive but allowing it to "take over" and let it do its thing, sometimes is the thing that makes you feel better fastest.  Just feel it fully, it passes and you can be rational again about what needs to be done.
A TSLA 1000c Sep 2022 is $8,000

That could buy 540 F shares. You could sell calls against your position and be invested in a seriously undervalued stock that’s cornering the Truck EV market.

Your TSLA call will expire worthless
Gambling is so difficult to extinguish because most gambling games are based on variable ratio scheduling. While the probability of winning stays the same, weaker minded people get caught in the idea that the next pull of the lever will be the “right one”. Bears take notes here

Tomorrow is a big day for SPY. Having broke the 2H 50 MA (bearish), 3H 50 MA (bearish), 4H 200 MA (bearish), and now is resting on the 1H 50 MA, we will either see a 1% move minimum in either direction, more than likely bearish. With many hourly and daily RSI’s sitting around 47, there is still a lot of room to fall.

Watch these vaccine mandates cripple the workforce &amp; further hit supply lines &amp; lead to even more inflation. I'm already tired of paying so much more for gas and beef. And what are these mad incentives to become unemployed? So many benefits. Of course people will choose not to work. 

Only plus is I can buy puts while I watch the dems destroy the economy.

I just come here. If people see the data as positive, I just inverse it and buy puts.
Gordon Ramsay taught me that business owners are more often more retarded than their minimum wage  employees.
Travelled on a plane this weekend and now have sore throat and a cough. Is this COVID? I was fully vaxed…
Work has me too busy now a days to day trade. My strategy has been mainly buying monthlies a few dollars out then cashing in small gains.

But that stopped working after evergrand

I have Leaps. Great leadership, super profitable and I love Zuck's vision for the future.  These are exactly the type of companies you buy when they sell off due to controversy.

U right u right.
Buy? Biiiiiitch
Red October.
Same here 😏
Let’s honestly see how SPY opens tomorrow. It should be red if we go off of the past two weeks of how the market closes the day before, strong chance puts could print. But then again, it takes a rock for it to up and a Boulder for it to go down.

You da real MVP 🤝
Yellen saw her shadow.
That’s what the other 10% do
I feel like we’re opening down 1.5% and even still weekly puts will be profitable imo
50k? Why are you not just day trading the volatility
Will tomorrow be in red again? What is the reason?!
I mean exactly that has happened most days the past few weeks
*the coin lands on its edge and continues to spin, it stands there after slowing, refusing to pick a side*

What happened to the market in the last hours of market?! The stocks fell down!!
Works if you have patience, set up target prices, manage IV and don’t pussy out. The most difficult part in all honesty is making sure you don’t get IV crushed so timing is crucial.
Ew
I mean I’ll take that too… but don’t need a huge correction just yet.
Spoken like a true degenerate
Puts on memory
Right before evergrande crash I bought spy calls and kept buying the dip until the ceiling shit and gave up.

50K on SPY calls expiring from 10/15 to 10/30 starting at 449 down to 440.

The closer to expiry they are, the closer to 449.

Buying the dip has failed me for the first time since April 2020 lol.
Yep. TY for your response but where is the yolo
WTF, Matt Amodio lost! Fuck, no wonder the market tanked today. 

Pretty sure he threw it too. No way he normally would have missed some of the questions he got wrong.
He never really was on their side.

What? No.
Well.. my line of thinking is who knows what spy will do.. but supply chain problems arent going anywhere for a long time. Calls on oil. Which means calls on USO
Unban me cocksuckers

Edit: Oh
Wait until 11
What were the calls at ?
For CPI yes.  But usually it's not so interesting.
Sell spreads on VXX instead. Better ROI lol

Anyone else so burned out by options and the market that they are just letting their $50K in SPY calls burn to a crisp rather than salvage and try to make it back?
I just like, I learned that I can't emotionally handle short term options. Its pretty much all I learned in 2020/21. I don't like that style of trading. I'm committing to not buying any options with an expiration of earlier than 2023.

Also, spy 350 10/15

Cathie’s buy list seems weirder and weirder as time goes by

That sounds legit about the dilution. They've done it before claiming to buy more mining rigs. I think Fidelity invested in MARA so seems safer imo
You’re selling both? Do you enjoy staying flat and having calls burn? 


Why don’t you just buy shares of good companies? Sell calls, spreads, buy puts on shitty over hyped ones. 


Not rocket science. 


Is Microsoft going out of business? Is their growth slowing? Is their valuation lofty? No no no. Okay don’t buy it then.

Doesnt mean im gonna go live like a dipshit and blow it all l, but it does not bring happiness, only short term happiness, but at the end of the day youre still just as depressed if not more.

The bumper to bumper warranty thing is great but it still takes a bunch of time constantly bringing in your car for them to work on it. Giant pain in the ass. Not a problem at all if it’s your second car though 

E60 M5 is hard to beat honestly. Really bad ass car. If I was trading that in I’d try to score a 911 from that same time period to swap to. Way more reliable and will hold its value even better

"Always remember, time in prison &gt; timing the prison"

-Martin Shkreli
When the vaunted N.F.L. coach Jon Gruden was confronted with a racist email he had sent in 2011 to insult the head of the players’ union, he said he went too far but didn’t have “a blade of racism” in him.

But league officials as part of a separate workplace misconduct investigation that did not directly involve him have found that Gruden, now the coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, casually and frequently unleashed misogynistic and homophobic language over several years to denigrate people around the game and to mock some of the league’s momentous changes.

He denounced the emergence of women as referees, the drafting of a gay player and the tolerance of players protesting during the playing of the national anthem, according to emails reviewed by The New York Times.

Gruden’s messages were sent to Bruce Allen, the former president of the Washington Football Team, and others, while he was working for ESPN as a color analyst during “Monday Night Football,” the sports network’s weekly prime-time telecast of N.F.L. games. In the emails, Gruden called the league’s commissioner, Roger Goodell, a “faggot” and a “clueless anti football pussy” and said that Goodell should not have pressured Jeff Fisher, then the coach of the Rams, to draft “queers,” a reference to Michael Sam, a gay player chosen by the team in 2014.

In numerous emails during a seven-year period ending in early 2018, Gruden criticized Goodell and the league for trying to reduce concussions and said that Eric Reid, a player who had demonstrated during the playing of the national anthem, should be fired. In several instances, Gruden used a homophobic slur to refer to Goodell and offensive language to describe some N.F.L. owners, coaches and journalists who cover the league.

Gruden, Allen, the N.F.L., and the Raiders did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Although not with a team at the time, Gruden was still influential in the league and highly coveted as a coach. He had won a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers following the 2002 season. And in 2018, he was hired for his second stint as the head coach of the Raiders franchise, which includes defensive lineman Carl Nassib, the first active N.F.L. player to publicly declare that he is gay.

The league said last week that it shared emails with the Raiders in which Gruden made derogatory comments.

Gruden told ESPN on Sunday that the league was reviewing emails in which he criticized Goodell, and explained that he had been upset about team owners’ lockout of the players in 2011, when some of the emails were written. Gruden said in that interview that had used an expletive to refer to Goodell and that he did so because he disapproved of Goodell’s emphasis on safety, which he believed was scaring parents into steering their sons away from football.

But Gruden’s behavior was not limited to 2011. Gruden exchanged emails with Allen and other men that included photos of women wearing only bikini bottoms, including one photo of two Washington team cheerleaders.

Gruden greeted defensive lineman Carl Nassib, who publicly announced he is gay in June.Ethan Miller/Getty Images Gruden also criticized President Obama during his re-election campaign in 2012, as well as then-vice president Joe Biden, whom Gruden called a “nervous clueless pussy.” He used similar words to describe Goodell and DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the N.F.L. Players Association.

The league is already investigating Gruden as a result of another email he wrote to Allen in 2011 in which he used racist terms to describe Smith, who is Black.

In that email, Gruden, who is white and was working for ESPN at the time, criticized Smith’s intelligence and used a racist trope to describe his face. The correspondence was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by The New York Times.

The league, Smith, and Mark Davis, the owner of the Raiders, all denounced Gruden’s comments, but the coach thus far has not been penalized and he coached his team in its game on Sunday against the Chicago Bears. Gruden said Friday that he did not remember sending the email and that his language “went too far,” adding, “I never had a blade of racism in me.”

Gruden's emails to Allen, who was fired by the Washington Football Team at the end of 2019, were reviewed as part of an N.F.L. investigation of workplace misconduct within the franchise that ended this summer. Goodell instructed league executives to look at more than 650,000 emails during the past few months, including those in which Gruden made offensive remarks. Last week, Goodell received a summary of their findings and the league sent the Raiders some of the emails written by Gruden.

In the exchanges, Gruden used his personal email account while Allen wrote from his team account. In some cases, Allen initiated the conversations and Gruden chimed in, while in other cases, they trade vulgar comments several times.

Some of the emails between Gruden and Allen also included businessmen friends, Ed Droste, the co-founder of Hooters; Jim McVay, an executive who has run the Outback Bowl, annually held in Tampa, Fla.; and Nick Reader, the founder of PDQ Restaurants, a Tampa-based fried chicken franchise. The exchanges begin as early as 2010 while Gruden was an analyst for “Monday Night Football.” In 2018, he signed a 10-year, $100 million contract to coach the Raiders.

Bruce Allen was fired by the Washington Football Team at the end of 2019.Andrew Harnik/Associated Press Droste, McVay, and Reader did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Gruden and Allen are longtime friends and colleagues. Allen was an senior executive with the Raiders from 1995 to 2003, when he worked with Gruden, who was head coach of the team from 1998 to 2001. Gruden became head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2002 and beat the Raiders in the Super Bowl that season. Allen became the general manager there in 2004. Allen and Gruden both left the Buccaneers after the 2008 season. While Gruden moved on to a broadcast role with ESPN, Allen became the general manager in Washington in 2010 and later the team’s president.

Taken together, the emails provide an unvarnished look into the clubby culture of one N.F.L. circle of peers, where white male decision makers felt comfortable sharing pornographic images, deriding the league policies, and jocularly sharing homophobic language.

Allen is the son of legendary N.F.L. coach George Allen, and Gruden — whose father coached at Notre Dame and whose brother, Jay, was head coach in Washington from 2014 to 2019 — are part of an exclusive network that cycles between N.F.L. teams, networks and companies affiliated with the league.

Their banter flies in the face of the league’s public denouncements of racism and sexism and its promises to be more inclusive amid criticism for not listening to the concerns of Black players, who make up about 70 percent of rosters. The N.F.L. has in the past struggled to discipline personnel who have committed acts of domestic violence and been condemned for failing to adequately address harassment of women, including N.F.L. cheerleaders.

In June, the N.F.L. congratulated Nassib after he became the first active N.F.L. player to publicly declare that he is gay. Goodell said he was “proud of Carl for courageously sharing his truth today. Representation matters.”

Privately, Allen and Gruden appeared to have few boundaries in expressing homophobic and transphobic language. In one email from 2015 that includes Droste, McVay and others, Gruden crudely asked Allen to tell Bryan Glazer, whose family owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers where Gruden coached until 2008, to perform oral sex on him. Allen said Glazer would “take you up on that offer.”

Allen and Gruden also mocked Caitlyn Jenner, who received an award from ESPN in 2015 after she transitioned.

In an email from 2015, Allen and Gruden criticized a congressional bill that aimed to force the Washington franchise to change its name, which some Native Americans and others have denounced as a slur. Again using a vulgar term, Gruden took aim at Goodell and his staff even though the commissioner had initially defended the team’s right to keep the name.

In 2017, Droste shared with the group a sexist meme of a female referee to which Gruden replied, “Nice job roger.”

That same year, Gruden was sent a link to an article about N.F.L. players calling on Goodell to support their efforts promoting racial equality and criminal justice reform. Gruden had advice for Goodell:

“He needs to hide in his concussion protocol tent,” he wrote.

How? This guy claimed he bought 436p on Friday. The cheapest they were on Friday was .76c, unless he was able to sell them at the end of the day today he didn't make any money, who TF would've bought those pouts towards close
fun fact: it does affect rest of the world
What if they are female?
Boomers still dont understand emails are forever. These are the people heavily invested in cyclical value and energy. Buy Tech before they realize what it does.

Noones buying it bro, only people who will fall for this kind of shit are middle schoolers with a 100 dollar account. You can hate China all you want but eventually you’ll have to come to terms with the fact america lost
I’m starting to realize Brandon may have us sucking dicks behind a dumpster to buy Xmas presents, a nice change of pace after working at the office.
Oh boy people at work ever discover the comments i made on this account im ded

Dunno if you watch F1 but the cuts to the radio during the race can be hilarious. 

Announcers: “Let’s check on Bottas and the team and see what they’re thinking of how the race went” 

Bottas: “What the *FUCK* I *SAID* I needed new tires why the fuck doesn’t anybody listen to me”

Announcers: “Great stuff folks what a race”
It doesn’t matter because that feeling is priceless

As I've suggested, they just need to sell an accessory "anti-baby flap" that reads "If you can read this you're safe."
Anyone who thinks Gruden is the worst, needs to spend an hour on a COD lobby
No but they’ll struggle when everybody who got bikes during Covid decides they prefer being fat and happy and they flood the market reselling used bikes

Gruden likes being the center of attention more than money.

He’ll be insane in a couple years
Yes, indoor cycling is boring as fuck, the average american is lazy as fuck, the used market for pelotons will crush new sales as well.
Just proposed to my cousin. Wish me luck
I’m an idiot. I can’t explain it. I just know red futes don’t stay red.
is there a simple link to the current banbets?
He literally owns a Super Bowl ring, what do you own lol
I had 4k worth, sold early figured it would bounce at 436.50 and uptrend for a minute into close

man do i regret selling them
At least my name isn’t Job

I'm not a millionaire but at least I'm not Jon Gruden
It will
I hope most of you realize that the market does the exact opposite of what this thread says almost 100% of the time.
It would have been a worse punishment to make Gruden finish the season with that crappy team.
Let’s just get to the point where all the boomers are dead.
It definitely will not be around in 30
She just wanted to make sure that you knew what are those things for

High income, low col. Texas or Tennessee. Take your pick.
Interestingly, a lot of vegans are ok with you eating meat if you hunt and kill the animal yourself. In their view it's much more humane than what goes on in factory farms. I haven't gone hunting myself because too many friends/family would be weirded out by it. But I just had them over for BBQ soooooo
it’s okay man i had OCT 15 170c that I sold for a loss last week
I’m deleting all my emails don’t want to get canned

Until we get a 300 Sparta meme I'm still bullish
joke on visual mod, already blocked that POS
Honestly what Gruden said about Goodell was not incorrect…
Move to expensive state get higher paying job, apply for remote work move back to cheaper state
There was a pretty epic one back in July. He bought 8k worth of Spy Puts on a Friday and expiring monday. Made $50,000

Where is sloppy
Yeah I deleted my Facebook years ago but thing is, this is real and happening right now. News headlines love to lie. It’s text. You can write anything online. 


Look at the videos. The pictures. Correlate with all the ‘information’ the news has put out,  boost is denying the cancellations. But the way they are handling it and lies being told are significant.
I’m pretty sure no one refers to their GameStop job as their “career.”

Hey AT&amp;T, notice that your stock has been on a downhill slide ever sense the face of your franchise Lily decided to cover up?  She was perky and cute, now she wears full shirt polos and hides behind a standing desk. Hey T advertising team, as a part owner I demand a say.  It's time for a new Lily.  She has ran her course, if she's not comfortable with the thing that made her famous, it's time to part ways.
It’s creeping back up already
Does that make visual mod their child? Are the machines breeding already?
Move to vietnam and be a millionaire with a child bride

No one should be surprised about this if they watched Jon Gruden on Hard Knocks

At this point GME is basically buy at 160s, sell when it bounces and tries for 200 so might work
Time to buy the dip again.
* Ron Jeremy has entered chat*
Lol for real, look at SPY’s 1 month chart. Or the 1 year
So Gruden called Goodell a flaming dick sucker and made an observation on lips.
Just have to deal with the boomer interface
“Futures open lower , due to Jon gruden news “
Sounds like you went somewhere to be an asshole on purpose. Congrats
*His ass
Look at the yearly chart. It's OpEx week, there's some general jitters, but we're currently trading above last month's low. It's rebounding between the 20day and 50day sma right now. Before the end of the week a decline of a few percent or so, possibly down into the 420s, would be in line with expectations for a normal sept/oct period in recent times... so yeah, could totally happen.

The pattern you're seeing on the one month chart from sept 28th through Oct 7th is a reverse head and shoulders pattern... very bullish.... basically a triple bottom. LOL

If we dip again and then rise up like last year, that period will be the head in a larger head and shoulders pattern.

When I’m president I’m putting into law that every kid has to hunt, kill, and eat an animal by the age of 13, (butchering a farm animal like cow or chicken will work too).

Wait until gas is +$4.00 / gal.
That’s a problem almost everyone in here probably has lol. People in here think 2 paragraphs is torture. I read 1-2000 pages of material a week whether it’s work related or just for pleasure. Reading is good for your memory, allows you to retain more information the more you practice it.
At this rate there will only be 10k left buying fds by the EOW.
Is this a viable strategy?: buy long dated, way otm puts and buy weekly calls itm/atm or slightly otm? Or is this a losing strategy?
I thought Gruden was indigenous? He can’t be racist
IB is always the answer. Fuck it I'm making the jump
You got a FAANG internship thats tough except amazon they scoop up everyone
I like AMD Ryzen chips. So I buy their stocks to give them liquidity to operate and produce better Ryzen chips. I receive dividends every quarter and use that money to buy more AMD laptops or chips for PC. It's only questionable when you decide to give your money to a shit company like NKLA and let their executives cash out while you are left with a big fucking bag.

It has been about 15 years since Wall Street fueled a boom in high-leverage mortgages to risky borrowers and a suite of exotic, housing-related derivatives that imploded when home prices tumbled, taking down investment bank Lehman Brothers and prompting a wave of U.S. and European bank bailouts.

Since that time, big banks have been required by regulators to hold more capital against potential loan losses, but also briefly during the pandemic were temporarily prevented from buying back their own shares

Lemme poke around with it for a half our or so and it should be back and better than ever. Not sure how it's gonna work for stuff with weird values though.
I believe in a long-term recovery but I'm taking profit along the way wherever I can. Was up 10% at open and it was an easy sell.
What were you all doing in the ikea floor display at the same time?
Maybe but it’s only evening futures.   Could so easy flip by morning.
Holding it for the dividend is dumb and the reason why the boomers are making the mistake they are making.  It has a hypergrowth component that will be spinning off soon.  HBOmax shares are the prize.  Once the company cuts it's debt with the deal the whole company will rerate and the EV/ebita calculation changes and it will be very undervalued at that price so even holding T after the deal won't be bad.
I'm stiff
Wtf???
I was made for the stock market. Ever since I was a kid green has been my favorite color.

T has been an idea for a while.  They have a nice hyper growth component that will be handed out as a dividend as shares in a few months.  The people who used to own it care about yield and not how well the company is doing so you are getting an unusual discount for a large cap company as they bail.  When HBOmax rerates after the spin off it is expected that both the new hypergrowth company and T will get a better multiple and the opportunity to play that game is now while the boomers lock in their losses by selling.

There was an article last week that said “Warren buffet doubled down on his investment in BABA” meaning that dude lowered his average to $160-$170, used his name to pump the stock up just right and it’s going to start selling his massive bags to retail as soon as he hits his price average which he did already I think.

/u/VercingetorixIII made a bet that SPY would go to 433.4814 when it was 437.86 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Let’s go bears let’s go hoo hoo
What I said is the truth and if it hurts you should try thinking about it instead of wanting to get someone banned because you don’t agree with them. That’s pretty sad
It’s the new SPY call. Literally free money
And now, only on our specially constructed water stage - a daredevil plunge!  Breaking the surface of the water, *she can actually go below zero.*

$100 oil is likely coming in the next few months. That can't help with inflation right?
Wtf
Ber in the sox closet
So this week along with me several other trash will be removed. Hopefully my portfolio stays green by not being here
That's 133.333...3 per minute. If you had sex for 30 minutes, you'd have dropped futures 3,999.9 points.
It does. Not sure if you have kids yet, but once you do it's insane. Years feel like they fly by in no time at all.

Gourd guy was early. Inflation pushing gourds higher and higher
Been fuk for like 2 weeks now.  Just keeps plowing money in.  At least he’s got cajones
Literal China cuck. Look at this guy’s post history.
Right? And no matter what news one follows they don’t really know either. Maybe it’s covid crashing after a slow burn? Idk it’s odd.
Yes. You can find plenty of documented sources and videos on alternate news websites. 


Media is once again doing its thing and company lying. It’s regarding the vaccine mandate for all their employees including pilots


ATC will also likely be a factor so it’ll affect more than just specific airlines currently they’re using bundled up sick time to go on strike. It’s why thousands just got stranded at airport across the country. They lie and say weather while other airlines fly same paths and peoooe in most areas have perfect weather.
It’s almost like none of this affects baba or most other Chinese stocks. Bears keep clinging to their racist hopes that aren’t real. It’s kind of adorable it’s like watching kids coming to terms with the fact that Santa isn’t real
We’re back to the kangaroo market thing again aren’t we 😑
I'll take it. Thanks for the answer brother
bro it's not state owned lmao.
Shouldn’t you be doing drakes laundry?
Nothing stays red and vix is barely up. You’re good bulls.

Lately only fake when green. The red is real.

No matter the day or what happens this statement always applies.

Is it possible for the evergrande crisis to be an actual attack against the us hedge funds? Since evergrande is actually state owned this might mean that the ccp has made up this fiasco with the idea to bail them out when everybody has already put money against evergrande. I mean its not gme, evergrande has the ccp funds behind em. Idk

There’s more to it than “supply shortages” but you’re right and in the right path. It will get worse.

I took a huge hit last Monday and Tuesday. I slowly went from 8k to 32k in September. Last Monday my account was at 32k by Wednesday it dropped to 7k. Then I went all in on spy calls exp Friday and got back up to 25k thursday morning lol. 

But today I bought calls in the morning, made some money, then I  bought and sold puts for small profits throughout the afternoon when I should have held those puts. I bought a couple of puts right on the last minute but I wish I bought more. Spy will go below that 427 wall I think. There is so much bad news with China issues, chip shortage, supply chain issues. I'm willing to bet that Apple will absolutely smash earnings but then they will bring up supply chain issues and the stock will drop. So far my winning strategy is swing trading spy options. I like when it picks a direction and holds it. Last monday and tuesday killed me because in the afternoons with traded within a narrow range and barely moved

It’s impossible to buy everything at the bottom without a little luck. That’s why I start DCA when it’s in my buy range. Baba at 200 is inanely cheap, under that wasn’t possible without collusion from the China racist gang on Wall Street. They did their worst and it wasn’t enough and never will be. Wish they would stay short so they can get bankrupted then we won’t have this problem again. People like soros Weiss and muddy waters need to go to the lake of fire and stop bothering us real investors
Now we know why it’s called SPY, it’s going to drill a hole straight to China and do some reconnaissance.

I’m a big history nerd, and what’s happening now reminds me of the early days of Christianity’s rise to dominance in Rome. All the old temples being destroyed or converted to Christian worship.

Except China doesn’t have an inflation problem because they weren’t irresponsible like the FED. Actually China is getting easy monetary policy soon. The more I talk to you the more I realize you don’t really know what’s going on like the rest of normal Wall Street bets level retail. If you’re not shorting it or going long on it then don’t worry about it so much.

The correct way is actually to steam it, boiling is a cheap way of doing that, the oven will dry it out and make it taste like shit. Melt some butter to dip it in too

Do you think MVIS is gonna make a comeback or should I sell?
WSB hasn’t done shit lmfao. Smart money has been accumulating, and retail with actual money like me have been as well. We don’t care if it goes back to 140 (it won’t) because we will have more money freed up by then and buy more. Everyone who was waiting for the bottom was buying when munger did. Banks started heavily accumulating in the 160s and 150s. No one is going to want to sell this low when the intrinsic value of baba is like 350 and soon to be over 400 with these incoming earnings beats. Only a true short term degen is going to sell for pennies down here

Patience dude. UVXY is gonna be 30+ by Friday.
Especially if there isnt a substantiated catalyst. I mean, pessimism/fear is a buying opportunity. But a negative catalyst and its time to cut the losses

I don't, but only because my grip is fine for what I am lifting. I have pushed my deadlift up about as high as I want it to go and I can finish my sets without losing grip.

As far as other exercises, I don't seem to need straps or a belt for them. But I've been doing this for a while now and have slowly built supplemental strength over a period of years. You become a lot more stable during most movements.

I was recently thinking of picking up a belt after a minor injury though.. its best not to fuck around with your back, that shit can absolutely cripple you.

Unbreakable support is at 132 due to multiple factors such as historical buy backs etc etc. that can’t break. 140 was the bottom dude it should have never even gone under 180. You do realize 180 was the bottom for the Covid crash lmfao. Bears were legit lucky it went under that, it was a violation of fundamentals and it’s honestly sickening but I appreciate the buying opportunity. No one who accumulated is thinking about selling for years.
I’m not so confident right now that we’re getting to 445 🥺

Right, but when that debt in collection reaches a point in which you are being taken to court, garnished wages, needing to hire a lawyer etc. It’s not long before you realize or that bankruptcy is pretty much the only legal option. 

Especially when you have routinely reoccurring medical costs and are unable to work a 9-5 with any regularity.

Will there be a reward for getting a ban bet right?
Word of advice, valuations matter. Don’t short at the bottom, buy it instead. China will never not be a part of the global market. Dumbest thing america could do is delist and lose out on all that revenue which is why it will never happen. They will just continue the same FUD cycles every few years. If you keep falling for it that’s on you

Over time they always will unless China and US kill each other. Barring that highly almost impossible scenario everything should be fine.

It doesn’t matter.  It’s all just numbers.  People file for bankruptcy and come back 7 years later and live normally.  Life goes on, it’s hard for everyone.  Some of the most conservative investors I know had a child with stage 4 cancer.  287,000 out of pocket medical bills in 2 years WITH good insurance.  They downsized their home and his wife got a second job.  They’re making it.

I'm tempted to do so. I am waiting on a bonus next month before I have enough. Most of my down payment for a house is currently in shares and I'm down 3k. I can't put it in a cd because of timing but savings is shit and homes keep skyrocketing. I'm fucked
I've fucked a couple chiros. Nothing special. A hole's a hole.

Yeah I remember losing my first 10k. It's just numbers yo
It's not a bad idea, heads I win tails you lose. You only get to keep your house (regardless of value) in a few states though, Florida for one.

My idea is to get a margin loan and buy a house for cash with it. Basically a 1% interest-only mortgage, and short-term rates aren't going up anytime soon.
I'm happy you guys like it. I'll try to expand it to more stuff, futures, whatnot. got interested in the flair stats instead

My best friend is a chiro, I’d say u really!!! need to find a good one.   If u do then yes, can even help blood pressure.
They're mad because they've had ample warning. Weeks in fact, to take the loss. Instead they doubled down, and now they have even heavier bags.
Honestly why not trade max margin and file bankruptcy if it goes bad? 


My friend filed bankruptcy for him and his wife 90k in credit card debt. Got to keep the house, cars, and have it wiped clean. Only thing is he has bad credit score for 7 years but again with the house and cars already who fucking cares?


Here I am paying my bills and living responsibly like a dumbass

You’re a genius. I’m going to buy a ring tonight before she finds out. Then divorce her. Tell her if she assumes my margin call she can have majority custody over the bean and I won’t fight it.

Just see an actual doctor
It really depends on your issue. Chiropractor and deep tissue massage cured me from some serious shoulder girdle issues I was having from some soft tissue damage.
So, in actuality,  I'm sitting outside with my dog in front of a fire.having an old fashioned.  On 10 acres with a nice house. Wife is inside cooking. No debt other than the mortgage. And yet I'm ready to drink bleach over losing $10k that doesn't really change my life. Wtf is wrong with me
Hoping my buy orders on GME fill, sort of like fishing. Get paid on Friday so if the orders don't fill this week I'll just sprinkle a few more dollars onto each order on Friday.
This is too accurate
How do I figure out how much this would be : SPY 3/22 520c x 200.
I did not find it funny. I can take the shit talk about pretty much any topic. But it has to be funny.

Only way you can get the types of returns I do are by incorporating leap options with your positions lol.

Yes I'm literally staying safe unlike 90% of WSB with their retarded yolos by setting a stop loss, thank you for being concerned.
So many tickerz way down from mid-year highs. Berz are drooling but I think there's more upside than they realize. All this shit is priced in, included in guidance last earnings cycle. 

We Goin Uppiez from here 🤡🤡🤡

It’s not that easy. Supply chains are fucked rn and it’s adding more cost to the corporations, which eats away at their margins.. plus us dollar inevitably going to gain strength from the coming rate hike just adds more fuel to the fire
goteeem
You have the boomer mentality down.
Like yesterday..
Zapps voodoo been my go to lately, never knew they existed

Who is Jim Cramer and why is he telling me to sell my calls

You call this a pump. Posts being downvoted left and right lol.
This is different, my friend.

Dunno. Seems like it would difficult to make money selling shit you don't have.
Yes slowing economic growth will be their big concern and unfortunately they have not been willing to add risk (loan/deposits ratio)

Rates will be good for their portfolio rolling forward primarily commercial but that will bring added business headwinds
If there’s a chip shortage why don’t they just make more chips?? 🍟
Please let us get back to ATH so I can sell everything
Nice. My avg for NIO is 38 and I have a good size position.

Must have been a short time frame, oil has been a great play all year, but it’s been a slow melt up
Holding SOFI. Duh.
My family is all from Maine so I’d love to see a Braves Red Sox World Series even though it didn’t go so well for my Falcons with the last Boston matchup.
Time to fomo was below 7. It's risky right now. It's a pretty sweet vaccine. Not sure if they will ever see profits though.
Probably have to resubmit since OCGN is up quite a bit in the AH
They know how to make me feel special
Knowing the market Oil, BABA and SPY will all be blood red tomorrow. There’s no way my gains are gonna hold
Hey we gotta be woke don't ya know
its going to be the same, but this time ill do it right.
Should I wait until Wed to buy soxl
I’m not easily offended. But I watched the first half hour and got pretty bored
Don’t think it’ll be a big deal would’ve seen it trending way more by now
Hmmm... Chip shortage. So, that means that chip makers must be selling all their shit cause demand is through the roof. Sooo... Earnings must be good, and it's earnings month. I don't know shit about shit but I'm buying some SOXL calls
People are just saying it because the Hollywood rule is to never joke about LGBTQ. The special was hilarious and very pro LGBTQ lol
Is the company you work for publicly traded and is it good or nah
People have been worrying about the Chinese adr shit since the 80s lol, it’s fine. If you have really done your homework and understand how the world works you will realize it’s not in chinas best interest to fuck investors over some of them being Chinese. They would fuck themselves over worse than they would the investors, they would essentially be cutting themselves off from the world by doing that. It’s just not smart honestly and I’m betting on the CCP to not be fucking dumb
its all good bro
OCGN peeps? Who is here
Zapps
Go outside, Take a breather, put the phone down
egg your own house to really sell it.
Every time you comment OCGN keeps going up.

Thank you now up another 10% in AH

Yay
Are we still pretending some POS is gonna moon ? Cos I’m just waiting for the immense death spiral

Why are u gey
I sold calls on 6700 shares at $7.50/share, locking in a guaranteed profit of $3800. So of course it fucking moons $7000+.
All those strikes from 400 down….a lot of Puts there. Vega really making much money on spy volatility?

I bought them at 438 today and thought I was absolutely boned when we got up to 440 and they ended the day ITM lmao

Oh I have thought about it too. One correction and the margin call cascade can be catastrophic

Bought 8 dollar calls today can’t wait for tomorrow on ocgn
Hi dad, can I be ungrounded from my Xbox so I can play fortnight
Ocgn is taking off
With the rate of OCGN pump on here I’m probably selling my shares tomorrow and wait for it to come back down
Cause it’s delicious.  Sugar free soda sucks.

Lmao half this sub was talking about getting calls at market close today. Trust me, if we’re red tomorrow, everyone will still be whining about losing money
You realize Russia and the Saudis can just turn on taps right? They literally couldnt give it away last year. Smells like a bubble to me.
SDC is still very much in play
Blue chips
Futes r red
HE'S DONE MIRACLES ON ME
Me? I wanted more.
Why do they even sell soda with sugar anymore? Every shop got 100 pallets of sugar soda but  that one pallet of sugar free soda is out of stock on a regular basis.

Hello
You could always get it checked with another doctor.
SDC, CLOV, OCGN. 
This is my retirement plan or my noose
"A new record-setting $200 million Chinese war movie commissioned by the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) depicts the Korean War Battle of Chosin Reservoir as a key victory for the Chinese forces that fought against the U.S. and United Nations, despite suffering major losses."

Your second link is broken for me, so first
$PIN$
Since February lol
Must have been born on year of the pig…
Something else not being talked about as a negative is the amount of margin debt out there. If margin calls go out, that’s what can cause an uncontrollable crash.
It was green to start.

That shit is over-hyper looking at the current demand/offer market.
This is how you get a bear to kick in the front door.  SPY FD calls during bear season.
What if I'm holding SPY calls I sold to someone
I'm not allowed to hand out candy, per the court order.
Been taking it deep for a month
Any fellow retards holding spy calls?
Don’t
I have 10/15 439s I should have unloaded for 400 today. Instead I kept the calls, bought puts 2x and squeaked out with about 1000 in gains. Offset by the losses on the calls of course. I've been limiting myself to 5 contracts, thank god.
I’m holding calls and yes to all the above

How could you not make money with that? We tested 440 TWICE
That reminds me, there is a place that requires vaccines where I live and I want to go give them some business.
If you’re holding SPY calls you most likely love Squid Game, Tesla’s, Donda, and a fat cock in your ass.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, nobody tell him
Same shit they used t say about Other stocks until they bought in at it’s lowest and then hyped the shit out of it for the squeeze
Literally who gives a fuck about PDT? Even if you don't have 25k you can day trade until the cows come home (but not after) with futures. Get with the program, numb nuts!

I'm going to open my own investment firm. With blackjack and hookers
SPY calls. Nothing scarier
I wonder if the price of oil keeps going up because they keep dumping so much of it into the ocean lol?
IMO the risk isn’t NIO the company it’s these ADRs that are just an ‘ok bro agreement’ 

I’m in heavy with NIO because I think they will succeed but my actual stake in the company gives me the heebies
hi garbage, im dad.
I’m still banking on CLOV and SDC making those retire early moves. Also I’ve been buying 20 to 300 CGN calls for $10 for literally two months straight and this is the week I finally decided to not and only got 10
Couldn’t even tell you how much my MTG collection is worth, one of these days I’ll bother sorting through it all

420 buy wall before the great leap to 500
Never. That's why PLTR filed the shelf offering a couple weeks ago, so they could randomly issue more shares any time the price rises above their desired price point. If the price drops below, they buy their shares back cheap using some of the $2.3B cash they have.

Their CFO previously was a lawyer for an investment bank.
Yeah i wouldnt be shocked. Boomers cant wait to dump their life savings in oil lol. Friends dad lost his ass in oil. Swore it could only go up.

We'll almost certainly test the 200MA at 415, but yes if we dip below that then 380 is still possible. But honestly, anything between 380 and 415 is a good time to buy if you're going to double down on stuff you want to hold mid-long term.

Had to laugh when she’s inverting basically all the other analysts saying it’s all good and BTFD
So you're saying we're going down or maybe we're going up
Imagine if you just followed this cycle. 


Buying calls early, selling for modest 10-30% gains, then buying modest puts and selling those off slowly once they turn to profit at 10% or more. 


Imagine. You could make a lot of money if you just followed that plan and we’re pretty confident.
Hopefully with a bigger portfolio

Not when the fed has to tighten it doesn’t. Stagflation on deck
By turning the lights off so the damn kids know to stay away!
My long dated 380 puts agree with you
Haha, good one. There's a bunch of unrealistic expectations on the market and not everyone is a smart investor, I just didn't want people to invest their life savings into stocks or CC at the market top, and many of them did. I'm sure you're much too smart to make that mistake.
Anybody buying OMI?
Nice bro. Your sell early was okay. That’s capital preservation. You can always buy back. That is a good rule that I didn’t follow myself and suffered a brutal hit last week. Like if you want to hold because you think it’s so solid, eat the fees, sell then re buy. Your conviction will undoubtedly waiver and you’ll not buy back, thus saving yourself from steeper losses. 


I did all of mine in first hour. What time did you?


I am finding continued success buying in the morning. Almost always calls. 


Bought 439 C exp Oct 13 for 2.11-2.13, sold for 2.75-2.85. About 35%, used about 100k here. 

I bought 440 C exp Oct 11 for .66 and .68, sold at .81 for 20%. Only used about 10k here. 

Bought these again shortly after at .72 and sold at .91 for 26%. Used 10k. 

I bought 436 P exp today for .50-.55 and sold .69 area. I only used about 10k here again for 30% or so. 


Why only use 10k? Nervous after big morning win. I didn’t want to buy. It looked good. But it was mostly a gambling itch. After the second win I was just testing the spy gods. 

Very good day after last weeks rough loss. 

Also sold TSLA held over weekend for a $4-5. Gain per share over 130 shares. Bought FB later in the day. 


Very close to buy puts again later in the day but IBKR doesn’t like me buying ops that expire in hours and I’ve been burned not being able to buy the dip so I don’t want to do that and the movement of later this week puts wasn’t enough to justify the risk. Oh well. 

Made some money on CLOV calls just day trading the 8.5’s at .20 up to .25 ish. Not many though. Some other minor movements. Ended the day up about 60k with bulk of that attributable to SPY. 


Had some good wins after big loss last week but not full recovery until now. Almost over 300k now after starting with 10k, 12k cad 10k usd I think it was in end of august with intent to trade spy calls primarily. I added 20k more though to sell some puts. 


So if I’m close to 300k with 30k ish in, 270 up. Sept was better because ended that up 2000% as the original 10 to 200. Now the % gains will look less extreme as I get too nervous. 


It does suck though when you see that you could’ve bet your main pot of 200 and gotten 2-3x more. I had some soy positions option simultaneously though which is why I stopped doing all in on calls so I could jump into other directions or strikes if needed. Has worked so far.
So what is SOFI? Like a bank for retards?

even as a permabear i think SPY's max pain is only around 380. The reason is because before the pandemic we were around 340 and now we have 40% more money in circulation and more retail investors than ever before.

I still feel like spy has some room down to go but honestly there are some really good deals right now in the US market. Qualcomm is trading a standard deviation in p/e below what is usually the bottom of the channel for them and crispr is looking insanely cheap for the growth that’s coming for their sector over this decade. This leads me to believe spy isn’t going under the 405 gap since there’s quite a few stocks that have already bottomed for the US.

I think we hit 408 by EOW
it’s not a bad move at all, man. puts have paid for months. though it’s getting harder and harder to see a lot of meat on the downside as risk drops with price. mostly I’d look for quick volatility trades and then opportunities to go long on OTM leap calls for a reversal. there will probably be reaction into the mid-teens, if not closer to $20 eventually. things tend to see at least lower highs on giant moves like the run to $28

The only competitor to TSLA is Apple Cars. I guarantee you every Tesla owner will switch to an Apple car if it comes out because they are conditioned to buy Apple products. Poor people will take out a loan and live in their Apple cars if that's what it takes to afford one. The only way for TSLA to win is if their car can actually FSD and it becomes legal by the time Apple comes out with their car. I would rather own an Apple car than a Tesla since Tesla are way too common now and I trust Apple's design to be stylish and clean.
Probably not, but it will get closer than a lot of people would like

yeah. historically that’s been a good move after a pump and it hasn’t broken out of a downtrend yet. if the market stays soft/sketchy, I could see the puts trade being profitable yet again. the daily chart seems like it’s due for steady upside, but it gets slammed on the first hourly candle constantly

I went to r/investing to see what they talk about and what their views of the stock market and I’m convinced the average age is 70+ it was all so boring with their 5% a year gains and DCA into everything. Even a deep ITM SPY leap is too much of gambling for them

Yea but there are no felonies in ANY state for speeding. Very few will hand out a misdemeanor. Here’s the [proof](https://ibb.co/yfgJv6n). It’s just a ticket and possible suspension. That’s it in mostly every state.

America is about making money. Buying puts rn is actually the patriotic thing to do 🇺🇸
Actually more risk in a sense. Deep otm options aren't priced appropriately for fat tail events, which translates to premiums being discounted (making them better buys) when compared to near/atm options. What makes people think that they're more risky, and rightly so, is that they don't usually hit. However, the risk to reward favors buying them because, like I mentioned above, they're discounted relatively. That being said, I do not recommend applying the same amount of your portfolio. It's one of those less is more type situations.
Have another toke or six, you know, to spur your curiosity.

I always enjoy a good masturbation session on optionsprofitcalculator.com
If they're for volatility, why are you buying atm? You'd get better returns on otm due to gamma rapidly pushing up the premium.
I disagree with that narrative. March-July 10 year was just as high, and higher. This is a recurring narrative. 10 year rips, SPY dips, fears wear off SPY gaps back up. If we gap down tomorrow I would base that more on the downtrend technicals with no positive catalysts in sight.
The whole world economy will crash two days before the day after tomorrow!
Titties are for big bets that are going tits up 😏
On the flip side unrealized gains. I've had gains fade and have sold just watch unrealized gains accumulate.  Lesson from this is buy multiple options and lock in some gains and let the rest ride.

better to miss out on a higher upside than potentially lose over 60% from holding

This is a new situation for the 2 of you to encounter.
Lay off the meth fren
That’s a mistake.
you got 24h. The avg. workday is 8h. The avg. sleep time is 8h. 

1. No sleep gives you the full 24h
2. Use the 80/20 principle (roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes)
3. 24/8 = you got 3 avg. workdays of time
4. with 80/20 you get 80% of a normal 1h result in just 12 minutes. (60m\*0.2=12m)
5. You can fit 5 times the amount of work into 1 normal hour (60m/12m = 5)
6. 24\*5= 120h = you got 15 workdays of time left

TLDR: sit back relax, you still got 15 days until deadline.
wait we both have small penis flairs
It's been a fckn genocide for weeks
I bought 3/18 $52.50 calls
did you try sticking your micro-penis inside it
I miss the old daily SPY gap up time.   bring it back plz
If tomorrow holds we could see a couple more modest days up to 20.5 EOW. Or market FUD could catch it and pull it down to the 17s again. Hard to say, tomorrow will be a big day for you.
NO FEAR ✊😭
What is with the feet and no titty?
So much for the $DOLE thesis. Currently 56% down on an 19-Nov $17.50 Calls. BUY MORE BANANAS YOU APES.

I’m only here to tell you mf that my crush said she liked me back
I’ll trade whatever makes me money, don’t care about the ticker

He can't give me a counter offer without getting it signed off on by senior leadership but does plan too.  Problem is it is 33% increase in pay which is hard to pass in our corporation and I am going from increasingly stacking global responsibility to a company that only has two facilities.  So I don't think he can really match.
They wouldn’t just cancel each other out, one makes money while the other loses? But I’ll try it next time I get a little cash on hand. Right now I’m just holding my Dec 31 call that I should make money on but currently down 120 on

How much is left?

Ahhh the ole SD Card inside a PB&amp;J trick….clever very clever
Maybe if it’s quick trip to pick up food or something but I can’t stay erect all day. And I know the pills say 4 hours is bad
why the f would you go for drinks with a chick if she doesnt ask a damn thing bout you
Yeah, 28 with a job that’s just under 6 figures and my losses amount to like 8k if things don’t turn around, so I’ll be fine in the long run. It’s more the fact that the wife is unaware and may become aware come tax time. I might have some splainin to do. Lol
Rotation to meme's TWNK it is

Anyone still in Uranium?
I only risked $1k today though. I wasnt feeling ballsy. I really wasnt even feeling $1k ballsy but whenever I see a dip that drastic I cant help but buy it
It feels how a normal blanket feels when you're dog tired slipping into bed. 15 lb blanket
Nah I bought puts at close. Opposite always happens to me. You’re good bro
Tequila Sunrise and homemade pizza.

Today is good fucking day 😎
PS- most of my positions have weeks left on them. Plenty of time for things to turn around. Not my CLOV puts tho. Those expire Friday. Not giving up on those just yet either tho. Hopefully that shit dies tomorrow.
Best way to lose it all, indeed
Not necessarily, if he bought them towards close and held them till 2-4pm today he would've either broke even or made 100%
I mean it's already up 50% for the month. I'll take my chances
I'll be in my hotel room. Naked. Room 302. Don't keep me waiting

Rolled my calls down a little lower today for 10/15… 450 is a pretty lofty bet but I hope you’re right cause I’m gonna be fucking rich if it works out lol

Bulls r fuk. This is your last chance to load up on puts. If I don't see you with a dick in your mouth by 9:30 tomorrow morning you have no one to blame but yourselves. You have been warned.
at least give me a exit point
Lol bet you did but even then your avg can’t be that much lower than what I’m expecting. I think a 2,000% gain at most would net you 20% gain overall
So open a straddle
Don’t pay attention to them they like to go in blind
Don't think theres any danger of that, Don't know anything about stocks lol
super glue works pretty well

I’m going to buy 50k in calls. Currently holding 100 calls for December up about 10%, bought last Friday at dip.

Buying a put at this point is how I will lose all of my money.
I bought puts at the end EOD. Opposite always happens for me. You guys are good we’ll wake up with a green dildo

wait until you pull the trigger on a dumb play, immediately regret it, and then strangely—cuz it’s Robinhood—your shit fills instantaneously. that shit sucks. I’ve been on tda lately and luckily they give you like 3 chances to pull the trigger. saves me a lot of disasters

Lol same boat, bro. We can share a box on the street together.
Do it somewhere that's cheap to live
Might load up on some baba shorts agains
you won't be alone.
I love mine
Don't feel bad. I literally did the the same thing February 2020. Got wiped out, said F this market and came back (boomer 401k) in June and really started throwing big money in my brokerage account feb 2021. Im 29 but my boomer ass payed off my house in the meantime, I can afford to yolo on some options if I see a nice correction. For now I sell CC and Puts and rarely get excersize except for this past week I got excercized for 10.5 TLRY and it was 10.49 EOD. O well. More CC I can sell
Itll be ok the bears won't win... I hope
7’s after hours coming
How can I get a project done in time for my upcoming biweekly project meeting tomorrow
You lost all of it already even a 2,000% gain on those calls would bring you to breakeven from here
Not happening bro. Done enough research.
like 80% of the market has been bear for like 6-8 months.  It’s just select blue chips, big tech, and bubble tech holding things up.

And if so, how does it feel better in comparison?

Rubber band that shit. If your dick goes green and falls off then you've solved your original problem as well.
Can someone translate this to retard?
I held calls all weekend. I just have Oracle calls and a Spy Strangle
Your dad should have done the same.
Just got a weighted blanket hoping it would help me sleep more than 4 hours and it's fucking amazing

no, but actually for real though, I'm going to be so fucked if the market just falls off a cliff tomorrow after this.  someone hold me and tell me it will be ok

You spelt “I’M A HUGE RETARD” wrong🤡
I recently started wearing a condom every time I go out because I cannot afford a child right now and condoms are cheap and safe and effective. 


Does anyone have any tips for keeping them on better though when you are a grower not a shower and you’re currently flacid like walking through the store or whatever?
Oof. Yeah, Ive done that a couple times now. The $3k in an hour salute. Its where you just sit and stare at your screen praying for a turn around while saluting it just to pay it respect
I’m a bear and this close could be a bear trap but we shall see!
Lol you were a bull all weekend.
Not much needs to happen for us to have a -3% day.  But to have a +3% day it’s going to take couple trillion dollar coins.

I'm up 16% on 38 QQQ option trades over the past 2 weeks. If I can keep this up for just 4 more months, I can recover all my losses since I opened my Robinhood account in 2016.
I sold my SPy calls for around 4000 profit around then and almost rolled it all into puts but I was being a pussy and only did a little. Mainly because Ameritrade commission is .65 per contract 😬
So everyone ready to get burned on jack's next P&amp;D (CLOV)?
Air for dinner definitely made me chuckle. Reminds me of the extra scene in Stepbrothers where Brennan is eating ice with mustard on it, and he's like "That was a bad piece of ice."

I lost 3k in 1 hour today. Fuck me. Shit immediately drilled lower after I bought
If I buy puts, the stock goes up… either way I’m cucked
Yeah you may want to leave before you learn

Bought a few right @ end of day, hope there's a bounce in the morning so I can get out before the craziness ensues.
It was 8%
CLOV bag holders keep on growing
I pulled a nice gainer % wise best one was $100 into 1400 never happens when I put in thousands

If rates tank normally thats because of a flight to safety.....so no. $SPY would likely tank.

FWIW....its the slow and steady climb in rates thats making the market nervous.
Not a meme
Got the day off today didn't even look at my phone this whole morning. Feels good. Back to tracking the market tomorrow. What did I miss ?
Anyone who would have considered that play doesn't have 3000
lol I do that all the time. Go back and look at its previous value and think "had I went all in here". But the truth is, no one goes all in "there". Judging by the volume anyways. I bought 10 calls one day and sold for $200 profit. Had I held 30 more minutes it would have been $10k...
Wait that doesn't just automatically happen every time?

My dad went broke in the 80s shorting oil and got margin called on his book. Wasn’t a good look for him. He hated oil ever since. He died 9 years ago and when oil had the 25% gap down March 9, 2020, it was that mother fuckers birthday. I will never forget that and the moral of the story is, don’t short oil, because most likely, you won’t see the trade work until after you’re dead.
People who aren't poors
I put 1500 into a spy put last week.  I netted -1500 two days later
Microsoft Teams fucking up my meeting. Calls on  $WORK

Seems like some analysts are expecting 90-100 (Goldman and BofA), even before factoring in an aggressive winter. And oh yeah, OPEC loves to get together and watch everyone invested in oil collectively shit themselves, but even with current prices they've stuck to measured increases rather than reevaluating, but that could certainly change with a move to 90-100 per barrel.
So who's that cat with the coins around here?

Was I the only one buying calls in VZ and T today?
gotta be the longest bear trap ever. For over a month now
It’s just to play off of the IV. Since stocks are on a negative trend volatility is rising = higher option premiums. If you want the best bang for your buck you need to buy further dated options to get a lower IV. At the same time you will see substantial gap ups (just look at spy chat for the last month). Just buy itm/atm Calls on large down days.
MTTR putting in work today, AFRM is finally getting a pullback, and their little sister is prepped for an IPO.

Stop saying gamma ramp like it means anything
how can they be real if its manipulated. the entire point of manipulation is to force the PA not to move in line with market forces
Not even a single mention about TLRY lmao
Crazy how I bought amzn 12/17 calls like two months ago for $5K and sold for $9K and they're going for $1,700 rn. I'm jumping back in on those

Spacs are like a money printer machine! Except the machine is broken and has no ink 😕
Isn't that more due to natural gas than oil? Most of the oil-related things I've tried checking out (Sinopec, Exxon, Chevron) and a bunch of others have only seen decent gains the past few weeks just because they recovered from some fat dips the past two months

Burry also said notice how when Kaplan and Rosenfren sold and resigned there hasnt been new all time highs

You’re overestimating the effects. The assumptions and rise in price now are already factoring in those scenarios to an extent. We would need not only a bad winter but a substantial move from Nat gas use to heating oil demand. It’s a risky move not to mention OPEC can come Flood the market at any given time. They meet at the beginning of each month making oil investors bite their nails in anticipation. We’re entirely at their mercy. However as you mentioned, if the winter truly is bad we could see $90 a barrel crude, I wouldn’t be shocked. But any spike above that range and closing into triple digits would most likely cause OPEC to open taps to prevent shale from coming back online
I think so too

You think you're better than the people smoking weed with the pup in the car next to mine, but they have their windows open and one of them mentioned giving their mom $100. When was the last time you gave your mom $100 while you were a working class millennial and that was a lot of weed money to you?

Crude oil today highest since 2014, natural gas shortage, cold winter expected, anyone else watching oil-related stocks? A little odd that many of them just don't seem to be reacting to news, but any sort of winter as chaotic as the last one (snowstorms and blackouts even as far south as Texas) could wreak havoc on our need for natural gas and oil, unless I'm missing something or overestimating these effects.

I had a great day today! Made about 15k. Took my account from 32k to 47k. Missed out on a lot more though. At one point I bought 200 Spy $439 puts for .68 and I sold when it dipped to .50. Towards the end of the day, those same puts were over 4.00...I'd feel a lot more comfortable holding through those dips if my account was a lot bigger. I only traded spy options expiring today. I love when it picks a direction and sticks with it

The hardest part of having so much sex with Colombian escorts

Is telling your friend who is back in USA on dating apps simping or with a nasty wife who cheats on him cause he did not realize woman love different cock and men to.

And that no human is meant to be with the same one for years and years and years

I want to tell my friend to quit the dating apps and that all the pussy he can want

All the Latina thongs and ass he can FOOK are all in a market place in Colombia for 170$ each

But I don’t want to dilute the market place

If all men catch on and go

Then we might lose that mans Colombia paradise

So … I need men , average men to simp and stay on USLESS dating apps chasing what today seems so valuable to them “ pussy “

There have been no further all time highs since the two Fed presidents sold in early September.

Don't forget that.

    With the market turning red earlier in the week, the S&amp;P 500 had quite the turnaround, gaining 4.5% for the week while closing at a new all time high
I'm never giving up this flair
Why am I over thinking this?? 

ARKK Puts 3 mo and delete the app
Oh you mean that fake DD obviously written to hand out bags from a stock sitting at its ATH.

Convenient it would come out at the fucken top and not during any other part of the run
How much was the contract and how much was the one they lost? PLTR used to go up like 10% on a multi-year $100mm contract which is ridiculous for a $50B company. I think those days are over
SDC coming back, let's get this going
You’ll be fine.  It is going to get hit hard next week
Don't u l o v e being told what to do by another human ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Calls printed too, hot potato game is hot.

I'm holding puts but asking myself, is it that bad tho?
Me too. My diet is full of fiber
But will it hold?

Any TWNK's in here?
Yeah she does, it’s how I was born
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) nice try politician! Everyone sees the obvious downtrend if they just zoom out 2 months! Ur plans been foiled!
Theta Gang will Wheel those Puts and sell the calls. They don't care if market keeps going down as long as people keep buying options.
kek, that's the spirit. There's gonna be a bias to about a year and change ago since that's when the bot was started. *Some* people will have older data since the bot looks back if someone comments in an old thread, but a lot of those are archived so that is impossible.
I’m looking at PLTR again. I see they pretty much lost a contract with ICE but got a huge contract with the army.  I’m surprised it’s not popping much to the upside.
Lmao yeee. All good. I decided I should stay. Going back is such a bitch move
Ya…. I’m over loaded on spy calls right now. I held today since I’m down 40% on those positions and I have until the end of October and November but ugh…. This is looking a little dicey. 

Don’t look good. 

Then again though we will probably pump like a mofo tomorrow for 0 reason at all
Same
The 700 point rally better happen before I get a chance to set up my $ROPE.
Slap myself for buying options .

Vro you hit a 7.5 bagger. Take da dub mayne. Chasing what coulda been would send you down a spiral

Well the gap is filled and my calls are basically worthless so let’s see what the fuck happens
Im starting to think green days are a thing of the past,  every time we pump now its a damn trap
Lol you guys are rarely right. Bulls are in the right to tell ya'll to shut up and sit in the corner.

So the supply chain backlogs help increase energy prices because of scarcity. Normally this would decrease demand but demand is also through the roof cuz of reopening and stimulus and likely will increase more with the upcoming huge infrastructure spending bill. This is basically inflation (transitory or not) and you hit the nail on the head: energy is one of the best plays in an inflationary environment
The more it goes down, the better off we are* 

*To a point
Fuck you, I can't believe you bought calls with your own money

My IWM puts don't like that. I'd rather see -3 or -4% tomorrow and recovery Wednesday plz
Did you want the same level of investment ability as El Salvador &amp; Tonga? Hard fucking pass.
My english no good but I know FUBO stock veli good will make me millionaire
i never wrote something this angry when we made money consistently both directions, mainly calls - especially on the daily V recovery overnight /ES futures... but yea i do kinda feel like a twat right now
Can someone do a Risita subbed video on the price action of today? Pls
At least let them have their copium. Don’t be cruel!

Everyone spamming the shit out of it last night
$420 by the end of the week.
You knew where she was all this time, Brian.

Why play dumb?
Imagine somehow getting offended when other people buy calls with their own money and ranting online about it
&gt; How bloody is it finna be tomorrow mayne?

I’m gonna guess we see a recovery tomorrow, followed by red Wednesday.
I'm bull, and hold over 100k in SPY leaps.

That said, this shit going doesn't look good. I could see us hitting 420 easy and maybe even 400 before we normalize here.
And then will rise like Phoenix !
We aren’t going to see that kind of price movement again, probably ever. Need to start getting your calls a little closer to ITM.
No you're the stupid one
You don't consider a 7% drop in two days tanking?
THE ALGOS ARE THE NEW FORMS OF GODS AMONG THE HUMANS !!!!

Well. We got a whoosh close finally. Now do we get a gap down at open? If we do its time to swing long. Futures are important tonight...not gay.

I'm an idiot, so of course I did.
SQ $245 by EOW would be bigggggg money. So naturally it's gonna tank. Sorry guys
Money is just as easy to make nowadays if you're willing to short above the 50.
The bull market is over until SPY is back under 200. Ye 🌈 bulls have been warned
Drink some lemonade and go outside
Every stock down 5-10%, spy down .72%
I think it's just all play and fun. Why you take it so personal you guhdamn snowflake
How bloody is it finna be tomorrow mayne?
For 4 hours tops
MARA is way better miner.
In times like these I always ask, “Where’s Gabby?”
Every time someone says bers r fuk, SPY drops $1. You've been warned.
So about two three weeks ago my parents were going to invest 50k into a Chinese battery company. Last week they found it’s now 100k. Lmao they backed out.

Bro zoom out a couple months. Settle down lol
Great idea, weeds out the shills
CLOV puts could be the move this week, with a good entry, if it signals another dump. that’s been fairly predictable and profitable as long as you wait and watch
Lol
That's me. It's cool though. I'm paying more attention to sdc tanking
Lol c'mon, it was funny
So what’s up with HTZZ
Kids, this is why you shouldn't do drugs

$20 for a scratcher seems cheap compared to $100 for a SPY option right?
Idk. That seems too obvious in this cracked out market. We probably dive at open and crank up like 2% half an hour before close.

This is terrorism.
The whole market would collapse lol
Absolutely rude. Why
Swear to god when I stop buying SPY calls this bitch is gonna yeet to 455 in 3 days.
I say carbonated soft drink
Maybe learn to read before only buying spy calls regardless of market conditions. Get fucked you losers. I fucking love it so god damn much. Hope y'all lose all your money. Day after day listening to you dribbling cunts talking about ber fuk.

The amount of retard behind comments about buying calls is just unfathomable. You get what you fucking deserve. "Omg, you have to learn stuff about the market to make money?" Reading a chart? That's all fairy dust bullshit says the motherfucker who never bothered to learn a thing and is surprised when they can't correctly time the market. Who could have fuckin thought.

Fuckin retard leading the retard. Technical analysis is a self fulfilling prophecy. If everyone uses it, that makes it true. I'm sure since you don't understand, that makes it all bullshit of course. Check the fucking spy daily chart and tell me how bullish that motherfucker looks fucking idiots HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡

WE are the market comrade, it is OUR market
I lowkey felt this
Get a temporary second job. 17k is a few months of work
Anything is possible if you put your mind to it and try hard enough
It's been 84 years, and I can still smell the ATH. Calls never expired worthless. Tech was flying. The casino was called the Ship of Dreams, and it was.
Soon my friend, we will be above 30
I'm not asking for one but I've been seeing people mention it
The scandal is priced in. Today’s red day was because of oil prices affecting overall market outlook. But red days may continue if yields continue to go up
If the bond market opens up and tanks will spy rocket?
SPY calls were the move to flip today until they weren’t. So rather than touching puts I’d like see flat-ish consolidation so I can sell for credit instead of risking debit
SDC. Something is really strange going on. Fees jump from 15 to 80% right at market closed.

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/SDC
Should of sold my BABA calls at open yikes
Lol liquidity isn't a problem at all right now. What are you on about?
I had a green day, is it possible there is a way to play the stockmarket that isn't SPY?
It's overvalued
I bought spy before it was cool
What part of the Midwest do you live in?
NGL I kinda miss the days where spy dipped monthly and bounced off the 50dma
Nope, after earnings imo
You are poor and you will receive zero dollars grow up
Fuck you corsair, go up
Unbelievable. I go into a meeting with PLTR up 1.5% and proud it'll close and hold gains...

Honestly bull trap at the end

Yea I streamed it and that was my only option. I prefer to read subtitles. I gotta work with what I got though.
I’m holding my puts till 425
I do vent a lot. I've applied to about 50 more jobs just this past day or two. I'm sorry to annoy you with my posting, I'll stop doing it. I'm always exhausted from work and so find it hard to study but am always able to apply here and there and am hoping for a miracle I guess. 

If I had enough of a cushion then I'd be able to code all day every day but I'm just grinding currently and am kind of at the end of my mental rope.

Again, sorry.
I guess I'm still stuck between 420 and 450. Used to buy 100 shares and a few contracts for less than 25k, and it's been insane growth since then that has always felt like a bubble. (I don't think it is)

You could have bought 50 SPY 10/15 450c at close for under $300. And some of you call yourselves bulls...
Maybe learn to read before only buying spy calls regardless of market conditions. Get fucked you losers. I fucking love it so god damn much. Hope y'all lose all your money. Day after day listening to you dribbling cunts talking about ber fuk.

WTF man
Netflix is a golden short opportunity.  ATH over hype of one show.  Will have negligible impact on long term growth which was already slowing.  Rest of FAANG getting hit with higher rates and will continue to.  Netflix will have a lot of catching up to do once the euphoria tops out.
These new emojis people are getting in flairs are fire, bravo mods🎉
Well, last year September and October were dogshit but we had a nice rally until February 2021. Load up on QQQ and SPY calls but monthlies / leaps. Weeklies will get fucked.

SPY filled the gap up from the 7th on really low volume. Not worth tripping over yet. If it breaks 430…?
Do a few practice trades where you keep track of what you would’ve done, and then write down the results.  If those lose money consistently, avoid options and buy stocks.

I barely got through episode 1. Don’t see the hype on that show.
doesnt count. thats the DOW, probably owned by nanci.
My guess is we open $430 and we have a small run up after opening, and closing somewhere around $432 tomorrow.
Fuck no
What they do 😱
Netflix is fluffing up their numbers. It used to be that someone had to watch 75% of a show for it to count as a watch. They bumped that 75% all the way down to 2 minutes. 

That, and squid games. I honestly don’t even think their gaming move did much.
I have $50. Clearly, it's not a lot, and frankly, starting low is a 50/50 gamble. Still, any advice or stock picks to help would be great. How would you go about doing this?

ATTN BULLS: I hesitated at the last minute on buying 440c into close. Your calls will now be safe.
Has your mom heard of Gamestop?  Yeah most likely.  Has your mom heard of Clover Health Care?  No?  They are not the same thing, not even close.  GME pulled in investors that had never owned stock in their lives.  Full disclosure I have no position in either of these, but I usually wait for GME to have a run and then sell call spreads.  Just wanted to defend myself against ape shit.
Thought I got the bottom of SQ when I bought those calls.

Narrator: *He did not in fact get the bottom*
There is very little resistance at these levels, 4300 could be imminent
keep sippin the koolaid kiddo
How do I invest in the squid game??
No bulls in here are  still virgins after the fuckening they got today.
Funds didn't settle from Friday, so I couldn't make any trades. My original plan was to buy calls in the morning. 👀 thanks Columbus ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)

Yes
I did buy calls but after it had already swung into negative, and a very small amount so didn't lose much. I would not be surprised if many took the 440 break as bullish and average up, though
Bought the dip and it kept on dipping.
Y spy drop eod?
Count me in

In other words ur fucked
I think the ones still here are trading with $100.

I'm worried about that man.

I checked Tent City but I didn't find him.  Cathie didn't know where he was.
Nice. 10/20 puts still looking good
It has? Lol 😂
Just gonna watch SPY to see how it trades early. It filled in the gap created last Thursday, so I want to see if it will bounce off resistance so i can make a play on SPX for weds exp.
Every analyst has it as severely undervalued and being able to buy at for less than $326 will be a steal in a few months
You must have bought high of day right . Get out tomorrow 7.60’s

NFLX is up +20% this quarter because they bought a shitty mobile game studio. Makes sense.
how long you think you’ll make it? a week? maybe a month? godspeed
I bought 10/15 $420p and $400p at close.  Just some spare change lottos in case we have a circuit breaker open.
10/15 450 are locks
Well, whoever commented to me last week that SPY would hit $475 eom and $500 eoy, and told me to "just look at the 3 month chart" when I asked him how he was so sure has deleted his comment. How's SPY 3 month looking now?

I'm not defending CLOV by saying this, just using it as an example. But, everyone is so quick to call CLOV a pump and dump, when GME is just as big of a pump and dump than CLOV, lol. GME has been in a perpetual state of pump and dumps for a few months now.

You're correct, but if you're buying daily high within an antagonistic trend then what are you even doing around here. Oh wait, I forgot where we are for a sec.

Earnings will be solid though and fuck put holders this week
Are you lifting heavy enough weight that it causes your grip to fail before your arms? If grip failure is not a problem you don't really need wrist straps for something like deadlift.

However if you're lifting heavier weights for your size you'll find that your hands tend to fail before the rest of you does- the straps solve that problem.

In other words: Do you need them? If not then don't use them. They aren't exactly a necessary accessory until you start lifting a bit heavier.

I was down $3k earlier and got back to up $400. I’ll take it. But would have been up $15,000 if I just held the puts i bought at the top. Fuck
Nasty Nate
Once you max margin and credit cards
Holy fuck Im actually really concerned about my 10/15 spy call. Why did my autistic ass buy so much
Massive end of day volume confirms that we are in the bear market
Is all of America just saying fuck work?
My portfolio drilling more than Elons image of being cool when he hosted Snl.
TSLA
Thread will be infested with goddamn bears tonight posting theories left and right
you ever just wish ghosts were real? would be awesome to talk to my dead 450 spy calls.
burry is shorting cathie. fuckin pig
We may never see a green day again
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Back to even atleast lol
Probably more $SOFI. Huge volume and huge reversal. Mooning to $30+ if a bank charter gets announced within weeks.
You mean anywhere outside a major metropolitan city lol?
Calls on adderall
That FB drop put my nuts in the vice today.
Oof. "One 'aw, shit' wipes out a thousand 'attaboys'”
2950...
Going to 220 probably
GREEN TOMORROW IDGAF WHAT YALL SAY
I bought it on Friday bitch
Spy calls?
Market dipped today but Burry still fukt. That gotta hurt
Yeah.... option contracts are not stocks I don't know why we need to continuously educate people here. They expire the point is to unload them
The true WSB wey
0dte Spy Puts bought at 440 mfer printed….🙄 too bad I didn’t get any 🧸🔫

When is the right time to go all in on 4k AMZN calls
Yessirr!! That is the Way! $SDC Baby!💸💰
blew up my account today so my moves tomorrow will be filing for bankruptcy
My asshole is broken all the way. Market is full of people taking profit and only buying going on is Algos manipulating to unwind risk and 401k funds on autopilot.
It was a swing of over 1% back down from the high though, that's hard on any portfolio in options

Edit: Any portfolio with calls that is
I went from down -40% to up 8%
Guaranteed? Ban bet it
gashed depending on if we find a bottom overnight
Had a bad feeling about SQ. Dumped out at open
Guh...
Get the f out man you down 99% already

Whistling past the graveyard until Halloween and the reaper gets me
Or 11/19 C450 like me
whens next stimulus check
You get inside
Yeah just got tired of the false sense of hope. I may get back in but just had to cut ties and start fresh
Went from being up 36% to down 31% lol
can we just talk about pegging without bringing politics into it jesus christ
All I have to do is double my money ten days straight and I’m a millionaire
This shit ain't transitory
Need more of a drop before I buy this dip for earnings
+13$ after trading all day, and beeing up 3k earlier. 🦘🦘🦘
Ayo fuck christopher columbus
Added more 10/15 spy puts at 440. They tripled in value
Just keep shorting the bubble dont be a puss. Gains for past 5 weeks going on 6 weeks have been gnarly
I mean it’s hard to say anything is “tanking” at S&amp;P 435 but loving the increased volatility
SPX and VIX going to be traded 24 hours next month, so everyone on WSB can show their autism all day.

WHERES THE LOSS PORN? LET ME SEE IT! INJECT IT INTO MY VEINNSSSSS
bc of worldly reasons

I did well enough today I'm literally not gonna be here tomorrow. And the craziest part that I still probably sold early.
I’m hoping it doesn’t happen because I have some 3 month out calls but everything is pointing to it!
Very possibly yes
LFG SDC
Hecho en cheena
stop being so aggressive please
You realize we were below 430 less than a week ago right?
Oh yeah I did
I made $2k by day trading CXCI but fucking FB keeps dropping and lost $2k now😂
Sofi Ah why😅
You sold nio?
All I have to do is make 30% in a day 20 days in a row and I'll be a millionaire
Bro please stop lol
Bonds are gonna finish spy off tomorrow
Got my nuts soundly kicked in today
Just be careful that it's always tempting to fall into one camp or the other. We ended the day 0.7% lower - not such a big drop to warrant all these '1929, party is over' and other dramatic comments.

Follow the trend, it can switch at any point. Unlike the roulette, this game offers you a slim chance at an educated guess.

Having said that, my 10/13 437p bought earlier today are already printing, ready to drop them and ride the wave upwards once the trend switches.
I bought more 10/15 puts when it was at 440. They tripled in value
SOFI carried portfolio up 6% today
Start banging the dudes on the inside.
When will AMZN moon?
Am I doing this right. $SNDL. I bought 1,000 contracts at $1.5 for 2cents each.
11am down -30% 😳  
Close up +16% 😎  
Edit: SPY AAPL puts
Any reason why market was down today ? Got some 436 calls for 13
So many big plays and everyone's focused on futures and SPY crab walking off a cliff ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Bulls destroyed, I was slowly peeling all my long calls all day but QQQs fucked me a bit. 

SQ what a POS
irnt? it was 15$ in jan and now $6. and its irnt? are u guys this stupid irl? it never squeezed
We really gonna go below 434 AH
[deleted]
Bullish on ghost cities. Wish we had those here.
**[F]**
Surprised ELY has been getting beat down as bad as it has lately
Trynna do both and losing money. Wish, FB and GOOG, all getting cucked
Boeing is gonna shoot to 270 soon.  dancing with the 200 MA
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)fr i didn't even notice it was a red day ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
To 428
Took a 20% haircut on some spy calls at open. Closed out and waited for the dip. Took another 20% haircut on those. 

Hoping for TSLA bankruptcy or spy ath overnight. 

At least I’m no longer holding out hope for NiO and slowly bleeding out for weeks
Asperger’s with downs
BRB, gonna hit the gym so I can get as strong as SPY's resistance to $440
Statistically, tomorrow should be a +1% day
Red monday like i said, green tommorow
I’m with you on this!
Damn, today was a pure bull massacre and this is only the beginning.
Can’t believe no one’s talking about SOFI
Today was a great day only lost 95% usually I lose it all.
3:59 sell volume set a very clear message for a little follow through
I had a green day, you did not?
again. what? up 30% last week down 7% today. cool. cant handle volatility? gtfo
Irnt 2.0
So Moderna starts at below $300 to start today, gets pumped to $314 and ends the day losing money sitting at 305? 

My two  315 10/22 calls keep getting fucked by this market manipulation b.s.
Prog!
At least there’s nothing happening in the Asian markets…….oh wait
[deleted]
Hey thanks man. I appreciate the advice!
Green day for the first time in a month 🥳
We are definitely entering a bear market in the next 3 months. DOW has been flatlining for 6 months. SPY has reached its ATH and is now doing a slow reversal. Money is being pulled from stocks and into bonds and precious metals. The energy crisis is going to only get worse. Hedge wisely.

Not to mention earnings which will really show how much growth has slowed down.
This shit can't keep tanking like this. Lol
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641) "we told them that we had to sell because it was a 'conflict of interest,' and they believed us!"
Wow that was ugly
440 to 434 lmao
March 2020 vibes, we're just hanging out here in mid-air like Wile E Coyote with a big fat Evergrande Canyon below.
I think we see a bounce back and I can cash in tomorrow at market open.
agree. Considering the current boom in the energy sector, I think $FCEL is really cheap at current price
SDC 😭
It's going to blow through 434 at this rate.
Bout to load up on spy puts for tomorrow
[deleted]
Not if you’re anywhere close to middle class. If so, you always lose
Around midnight I think. Futures of course.
I can't feel my butthole after that close today.
QQQ -0.11% AH and timberracing
This Retard is  buying more $SDC @ Discount, all the FUD and calm comes before SS, get in and get rich! Or not! Simple! 👨‍🚀👩‍🚀🚀💰
May have to liquidate everything at open tomorrow and wait to pick my move. Confident I'll make some money, but these current picks may not be winners.
reevaluate life choices until market open and repeat mistakes
[deleted]
you named your right and left hands?
YEAH THAT'S THE MOVE
It’s still going
Down like 3% today.  Bears trying to ruin this for us normies.
I trade pm because I have 9-5 and because I'm used to getting up at 4am

I sometimes close in AH because I forgot to close between 9:30 and 4

When I do either of those price doesn't change but if many like me do that then price will
Well I discovered I needed to buy 10x my 10/15 420p to salvage the rest of the carnage in my account but at least it stemmed the bleeding
Bring back 2020.
Spy still diving
Back up we go tomorrow, guaranteed. Probably +1.5% on QQQ
Fucking amazing finish![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
It could be worse, you could have 450s like me
This market being held up by paperclips man its crazy
Yearly stimulus checks going out. $1,114 this time, not great, but not shabby.

Oh most of you don’t live in Alaska? That’s too bad.
I'm definitely gonna wake up to more blood tomorrow 🙁
I was inches away from dropping $17 (waiting for it to go to $15 🤡) $438 put, and it went up to over $300 by eod, RIP, maybe being a care bear is worth it sometimes
Lucky bastard. I haven't seen green in weeks.
And we'll all have puts and make a fortune, right?
Idk what the support is supposed to be for SPY but 435 seemed very meaningful to breach.
I bought some PLTR at the literal top today. So this is how it feels, huh?
Not today looks like 7.75 coming
you think we roll net 120+ on ES.Z21 by then? good luck
sour hour cleaned me
RIP
Are we ded yet
Absolutely DRILLING AH. Holy shit this actually the recession continuing. Possible circuit breakers here on out. Fuck……
We need to make FCEL meme again, there are way more retarded tickers mooning right now!
Why are you still buying the dip…
Well. Another ATH today for my port! Moves tomorrow entirely depends on what rates do tonight.
Unofficially? So I'm only *unofficially* homeless now?
[deleted]
-1% by open on SPY
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
the insane thing is that SPY is not even 5% from ATH after all these drops lol

Anyone shit in their pants like the dude from Heels?
Sdc closing at $6.12
I guess I’ll keep holding this MRK and AMD debit spreads…
Shit where did I save my SPY 420 memes.

Yeah?
Well good news is my 401k contribution won’t be at ath
It goes in waves. I love looking at old financial papers because they did the same shit we do, just kept the wife's boyfriend and cocaine out of it.
Don’t worry about what others think of you, use straps if grip is a limiting factor and go about your day
BULLS MURDERED
My SPY calls got filled seconds until close so GUH
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Very bullish close, love it. ❤
My 10/15 440’s don’t feel so good right now.
Don't take advices from this club
SPY up 0.1% and all small and midcaps -5-10%: wsb: you don't know what a dip is

SPY down 0.7% and midcaps/smallcaps allmost all green: wsb: end of the world, markets are down
The downtrend is so obvious that even Superman became a 🌈🐻 today
that rug pul at close brought a tear to my eye 🥲

just beautiful to see bul get fuk like that so suddenly
I mean what sort of financial education would u need to see this shit coming
Another day another close below the 100
The spread is fucking nuts like 2x the # of calls
wow glad i didn't trade today 

(I couldn't trade today bc I blew my account up on Friday and I'm waiting for funds to transfer btw)
[deleted]
😂😂 Those calls trading for .05 but you probably have to sell on bid for .04
Thank you, MMs for dropping the markets at close on no new news, to trigger my GOOGL 2900c buys at a discount, two weeks before another blowout earnings.
naw
Raise your hand if you bought calls EOD and don’t regret it? 

Ok now lower your hands you fucking liars
Well...430 at open tomorrow?? Fuk....
Ended up $17 in the green today lmao
you will regret that tomorrow… will be green
Sick
Rates flyyyy, btw when do they open lol
Tomorrow, roll out of bed around 7, walk the pup, make some espresso, realize how fucked everything is, and watch these QQQ puts and UVXY calls print.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553)
SPY won’t let me get any pussy 😞
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
$FCEL
I really miss the old SPY
Just another day of indexes casually dropping over 1% from their daily high.  Not a statistical anomaly for this to happen every day for like 3 weeks or anything.  Totally normal nothing to see here move along
Vix did a perfect cup and handle holy sht lol
Don't worry, SPY is still going to keep dropping. I have yet to have my fill of salmon. As long as those fuckers keep trying to swim upstream, Imma keep eating them.
Buy FAANG or be a penny flipper. The only way to make money.
Question!? What makes the stock price changes pre and after market besides the news?
a holiday
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Closed out my SPY puts for $$$. Talked myself out of Sophie puts at close. Mostly cash gang with a few lottos. Think I'm gonna take my ball and go home for the week. Godspeed and God bless.

#THIS WEEK WAS FUN!
*Aftermarket enters the chat
just like your wife's panties
See I would get downdooted for that

BULL ASHES
Well. Another ATH today for my port! Moves tomorrow entirely depends on what rates do tonight.
If Christopher Columbus would’ve stayed his ass in Spain, I wouldn’t need to be here working a 9-5
You think that’s bad wait for tomorrow 💀
How strong do you have to be to use wrist straps in the gym and not look like a try hard?
Oh we doin 1929 stylie huh
Yeah even the 440c is discounted right now!
Buying calls on inverse ETFs doesn't make you a bear because you're still buying calls. Think of it as the financial equivalent of shouting "no homo" right before eating the ookie cookie.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
I know technical analysis is astrology for dudes - but when you see that gap get perfectly filled like today you start to believe…. Bank earnings better be off the charts to get out of this downtrend
Fellow bears, this is why we always stay the course with Puts on a downtrend!
+ 5k CLOV
$405 open
How far down, LUV? How far down are you willing to go?
Burry is feeling really 🌈
It apparently gives no fks
Bulls still can’t figure it out.  The party is over
I swear shorting is getting a bigger practice with stocks
SPY didn't dip enough to make me wanna spend much on calls today so I just picked up a 2/18 515c for like $19 at EOD. Still available after hours if you want one
At least this is the bottom!
What the fuck was today
Sell puts to you degenerates when tomorrow is red!
Now that tech is dead, any recommendation on a newspaper that prints shitposting on their articles?
Following Bill Gates into GWH since I didn't learn my lesson on CPNG

These calls are up though. Hoping to see $11.50 by open.
My accountant gonna be like “you realized lots of losses where are the gain? “
Yay for buying 0DTE SPY calls at open today and selling right at the top before that freefall. Not buying shit tomorrow because I can't buy 0DTE's.
Bought a couple 10/20 $446 SPY calls seconds before market close. 

Let’s do this!
Just waiting for my SPY and QQQ 10/13 Iron Butterfly spreads to blow up
its been garbage since january. interesting timing
Bears guhed at open, bulls guhed at close
Bought more on a discount
Not even a 1m sell candle? Bullish

How bad tomorrow??
When is the crash coming
Um wtf?
Nice move retard

Spy great close . Grabbed calls on the cheap
Holy shit FB, glad I didn't buy these calls when they were $4,500. I'd be pissed.
Hey buddy markets closed don't need to drill more

This market is fucking garbage
I'm going to sell my car for gas money.
Lose more money, duh
Christopher Columbus made me lose money 😠
We’ve really been given every chance to get out of this market at this point. Sure we might get another 10-20% out of it, but there’s no question the foundation is faulty and it’ll drop hard and fast

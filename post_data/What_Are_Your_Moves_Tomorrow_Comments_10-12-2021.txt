But I don't need naked options to lose money. I have short-term calls.
Test 4340 before pre-market, back up to 435 at open on an uptrend, rip like mad, bear trap at noon, rip some more at 2pm, little sell-off EOD, and I'll see you all back here for our regularly scheduled ribbing and bickering

Problem is that OCGN only has rights to distribute in North America.  US FDA has already stated they will not give Covaxin EUA but they need to go through BLA which will take years, so this news means fuck all for the company.

Add in the fact that the last two times this pumped the company did a direct offering that fucked it all up and then led to a crash.

I would stay far far away, but you do you.
They got some sort of approval. Read about it on stocktwits. Was gonna buy calls at close but they never filled. Fml
WHO approval this week and India just approved covaxin in children as young as 2 years old

I‚Äôll be buying calls on Reddit at ipo for sure
BABA makes more money than some of the trillion dollar companies‚Ä¶ reasonably we could see the price in the thousands in the long term. Plus China is going up in general, while we‚Äôre crumbling in America.
It's hilarious that once Gen z wakes up that stock market goes up. Those guys literally do not give a fuck. They don't have enough money to change things yet but just wait
Why are you sooo sure that CPI will be bad?
Because I didn‚Äôt have the money. Unfortunately
Lots of cargo containers are stuck empty in places that don't export much so no one wants to pay to ship them anywhere.
LOL I just need someone to reassure me I‚Äôm not a dumb ass. But I will look Into it! I‚Äôm smoking a pretty strong indica strand, but my anxiousness is outweighing it all. I‚Äôm basically dead tired but do not have the ability to sleep.

What's going on???
Covid is one reason (we are comping over some deflation) and relations between us and China also.
&gt; In pre-1980s reform China, the socialist state fulfilled the needs of society from cradle to grave. Child care, education, job placement, housing, subsistence, health care, and elder care

&gt; Welfare reforms since the late 1990s have included unemployment insurance, medical insurance, workers‚Äô compensation insurance, maternity benefits, communal pension funds, individual pension accounts, universal health care.

Sound familiar? Literally all the shit we have here in the US, at least the Chinese call themselves communists. We try to act like we‚Äôre a country based on the free market but that really hasn‚Äôt been the case for a hundred years.
Comes down to a lack of giving a fuck from a tired deteriorating middle class that doesn‚Äôt want to work for scraps anymore for the elite while things keep getting worse and worse for the common man while the rich get richer.
SQ trying to make a move‚Ä¶
I literally accidentally became a weed dealer for awhile because I was buying in bulk for myself to save money and all my co-workers constantly wanted grams, maybe eighths. I started selling just as a favor then suddenly was having all my smoke paid for just by selling small quantities on work breaks. Good times.
Do the supply chain issues really just boil down to lack of truck drivers and port workers?

Yep. Anything under 250 is a sizable discount for long term. 140 was just asinine. Wasn‚Äôt possible to go that low without illegal collusion from Wall Street, but hey what else is new.

I don‚Äôt even drive, my girlfriend drives me around in my car. So what if she crashes my car into someone in a hypothetical world where I didn‚Äôt need to have insurance? Then I guess they‚Äôd hire a lawyer to try and sue her, realize she has no assets in her name, and then they‚Äôd go cry I guess.

If you didn't see the bottom back then there is no way you saw the top last month.

The WHY you ask, is you. You are the reason.
Zero
I didn't say this year did I? But it's got about the same chance as 480. All the tail winds are gone.
Closing my puts at open and buying more at 11am. Let the games begin.

No
January $45 put (-$4.5 under current stock price) has 10,000 open interest. 
Just like last time I would have to sell for maybe 5 or 10% under price to get it to fill but hopefully by that time it'll be up a couple hundred percentage points.
Bulls too busy spending their gains. Did you see morning spy spike?

Shut up Roman, we‚Äôre going shopping.
Idk what happened to me‚Ä¶I was here a while back and trading became my life. Now I can‚Äôt find the energy for something I used to live and breathe and I keep coming back and announcing I‚Äôm back (more to myself than expecting anyone actually reading my comments lol) and then I‚Äôm gone again and I‚Äôm drained by life and I can‚Äôt even find the motivation to do the one thing I really love anymore
Something? Are you illiterate ?
Black bear upgraded to grizzly bear.  Winter time we upgrade to polar bear.
The Boss is a good man..
Funny you should mention that because that's exactly what happened with the Vancouver stock exchange in 1982. The software that calculated the index (like SPY) was truncating its calculations to 3 decimal places and dropping the rest instead of rounding so the index kept dropping for 2 years even when all the stocks were going up and nobody knew why. Ultimately they figured it out, and reset the index value before putting the new system in place.

Yes, I did. Proof below. You should totally bet that PLTR be going to $16! You seem to be really convinced! 

This is in my fast trade $10k acct that I have had for 8 months. I am not rich, so I am rarely risking more than a few k per trade. I‚Äôm up $183 on PLTR all time, made money off the 10/4 buys.

Banks see uncertainty in current market stability, they don't like that.

Banks need borrowers to prove they have liquid to close their positions. 

Borrowers need to sell other positions to prove they have liquid to meet their obligations.

The selling pressure causes Banks to see uncertainty in current market stability, a thing they continue to dislike.

Banks require more proof for position closing

with the upcoming holiday season and traditional family get togethers, please dont spend your time stumbling over yourself; telling your family about some dd you read on the internet; unintentionally stoking fears that you may be in a cult or mlm marketing scheme. dont create a situation where the next time you talk to them is holiday season 2022, and all they can remember about you is how excited you were to be in a cult. ask them how theyre doing. think about something else. the holidays aren't supposed to be about making money. theyre supposed to be about spending it. on apple products. which is why you should make sure to tell your family to get into apple.

Wrong the United States has the power to compel certain s standards in health care facilities. I am required to get tested for TB yearly, I had to get Hep B vaccines and chicken pox vaccines to get into nursing school. If you are infected with an infectious case of TB the government has the legal authority to compel you to comply with the medication regimen. Challenge it in court if you don‚Äôt like it but there is standing to require it in healthcare facilities.
This reminds me of a time where teachers and doctors were payed per child prescribed adhd medicine. Like y‚Äôall gave your kids meth and everybody turned a blind eye, so no don‚Äôt trust them for shit.
Sucks, yeah I haven't really heard anything good about it.  I'll probably just wait till it's out on EA Play/Game Pass Ultimate.
Nope. I'm asking why would a stock stop trading before traditional close
It has nothing to do with politics, you‚Äôre no fucking hero for a fucking vaccine, a virus so deadly you need to be tested to see if you even have it and a vaccine so great the government has to threaten you to take it. It‚Äôs a joke really, never got the flu vaccine and I also contribute me not taking medicine or these unnecessary vaccines to fight whatever virus is in my system. You should just take care of yourself and fight as long as you can because when you‚Äôre older it‚Äôll catch up to you with all this shit you got pumped in your body.

90 percent of people dying currently are unvaccinated you derp. And saying its not reducing transmission is just plain wrong. Puts on you.
Now futes will try for green till 1am and dump the moment Europoors show up
How tf does this comment make or lose anyone money. You know what this subs for right? Also its called herd immunity. Every cunt who doesnt get vaccinated equates to more chances of mutations for the virus. And people who have organ transplants the vaccine doesnt work for, so the longer we have covid spreading from unvaccinated people creating stronger variants, the more avoidable deaths we will have. Hence why we dont have measles and polio anymore. Know who enstated the first vaccine mandate for the military? Washington. Know it was highly unpopular since it was a new and scary technology? Know that its the only reason we won the revolution? Because we innoculated against smallpox and the british didnt?  But keep bein a selfish asshole when its a proven safe vaccine.
I heard the guy who posted that got banned from Reddit
weekly premiums on AMC were \~15% the value of shares if you ran wheel or straddles. In 7 weeks, you could pay for 100 shares with just premium collected if it traded sideways. Cant say why other people got in, but thats why I did

Nurse here... lol nursing shortage has forever been a problem the mandate only made is slightly worse. Most of the healthcare people who were fired for no vax were non clinical like housekeeping. 

However it is dumb as fuck to make healthcare get a vaccine when it doesn‚Äôt stop transmission. I‚Äôm vaccinated but government are the ones who will have to continue to shell out insane money to travel nurses due to furthering the shortage. My salary went from 100k to 275k in 2020 and 2021...

But if the leap is also itm and weekly call was  5-10% otm but now expires itm. Does  it let you buy the shares to sell to the weekly call and then you keep the share difference.
I mean my parents apparently couldn‚Äôt figure out life insurance either so it makes since I‚Äôm worthless lol
I did
Lol yes, typo. 437.
It doesn‚Äôt force you to exercise the leap, you‚Äôll have to likely exercise it yourself. Hopefully your broker isn‚Äôt shitty and liquidate something else, but don‚Äôt take that chance and if you know you‚Äôre getting assigned then speak with your broker immediately or exercise that shit

The worms isn't the problem. You probably have food poisoning and are drained of electrolytes from your diarrhea. You need to hydrate, and I don't mean just water. Get some gatorade power and mix it and drink that shit. If you don't have that then chug some gatorade, not too much tho cuz there's quite a bit of sugar. Stay on bland foods for a few days and you'll be fine

Therefore, if you want to appreciate how good or amazing the good things are, you gotta know what the bad things are and how ugly it is. Relativity is important when you wanna talk about how "good" or "bad" something is, so those people are just showing you what the bad is, then you'll know how good the good is lol

Or you tell them to go try and find another one not at sticker less then 3 states away. They might leave and come back 2 days later like "Okay... instead of 10k over sticker lets do 7k over sticker and Ill take the car today"

Or you have people who will just open a loan on anything and if they get approved they dont give a fuck what that payment is.

If all goes well it‚Äôll have a 96% profit margin on 16 billion in revenue by 2030. 1000 per share would literally, not be a meme
When you have intense fear about something, like at work, a trade that might go south etc.

Kinda counterintuitive but allowing it to "take over" and let it do its thing, sometimes is the thing that makes you feel better fastest.  Just feel it fully, it passes and you can be rational again about what needs to be done.
A TSLA 1000c Sep 2022 is $8,000

That could buy 540 F shares. You could sell calls against your position and be invested in a seriously undervalued stock that‚Äôs cornering the Truck EV market.

Your TSLA call will expire worthless
Gambling is so difficult to extinguish because most gambling games are based on variable ratio scheduling. While the probability of winning stays the same, weaker minded people get caught in the idea that the next pull of the lever will be the ‚Äúright one‚Äù. Bears take notes here

Needs to be a WSB ETF. And thusly an inverse leveraged x3 version. I would buy that.
Yes. The problem is, I think MMs and big boys were pumping up the market for a while to get retail to get in as deep as possible, and when they decided it was enough and one started taking profits, they all just started doing it. Now it's just a huge chain reaction and retail is left bagholding
That‚Äôs cool
Now I think ur a flammer

I see those oil futures about to flip green üòéüá∏üá¶üáÆüá∂üáÆüá∑üáØüá¥
Yeah for sure. That‚Äôs what scares me about deadlifts. I feel like I would hurt myself because of terrible form.
All in SDC tomorrow morning
Well futures are fake but I'm still glad I took my $50 loss on calls and went cash before end of day
Exactly... Also, does it have to close at the bet by then or if it hits it bet never sees a close at or below/above is that still a win?
Increase the inflation bigly and then raise the minimum wage. Retards would praise them like it actually helped them.

Sell whatever you got and put it in SPY or QQQ puts for Wednesday $3 OTM. Sell in 30 minutes to 1 hour. Might be able to get away with some gains. If you come out on top, send me a reward. If not. Fukk

That would be cool. Otherwise someone could just win a bunch of bets on 1% movements

I'm not so sure.  We've been shaken a few times in the past month or so.  People may be scared.
Worst case scenario it continues to drills for maybe 5 minutes then spikes for the rest of the day

If you can't formulate what direction a certain stock or index is going to go based on the research you've done, then just don't make a trade that day or that week. FOMO is one hell of a disease, but patience is the name of the game
no clue. I do know the people who bought the rights from judas are ratpack entertainment.

I get a lot of people messaging me about documentary stuff, usually asking to come meet me or have me go somewhere. I never do it. It's just weird as fuck. I'd rather send an email.

Damn bro. Just bite the bullet and close the position and walk away for a few days. Don't dig yourself into a hole like dat. Take whatever you got left and go on monthly XOM calls for like 12/31 or some shit after the dip this week. You will most likely get paid for these and hopefully make your money back lol.

Puts on memory
Right before evergrande crash I bought spy calls and kept buying the dip until the ceiling shit and gave up.

50K on SPY calls expiring from 10/15 to 10/30 starting at 449 down to 440.

The closer to expiry they are, the closer to 449.

Buying the dip has failed me for the first time since April 2020 lol.
Yep. TY for your response but where is the yolo

Anyone else so burned out by options and the market that they are just letting their $50K in SPY calls burn to a crisp rather than salvage and try to make it back?
I just like, I learned that I can't emotionally handle short term options. Its pretty much all I learned in 2020/21. I don't like that style of trading. I'm committing to not buying any options with an expiration of earlier than 2023.

These CNBC clowns really do be the dumbest. Guess which companies have the strongest pricing power in an inflationary environment? It's not cyclicals, dumbasses. It's mid cap and large tech with their mountains of free cash flow. Buy the tech dip.

"Always remember, time in prison &gt; timing the prison"

-Martin Shkreli
When the vaunted N.F.L. coach Jon Gruden was confronted with a racist email he had sent in 2011 to insult the head of the players‚Äô union, he said he went too far but didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúa blade of racism‚Äù in him.

But league officials as part of a separate workplace misconduct investigation that did not directly involve him have found that Gruden, now the coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, casually and frequently unleashed misogynistic and homophobic language over several years to denigrate people around the game and to mock some of the league‚Äôs momentous changes.

He denounced the emergence of women as referees, the drafting of a gay player and the tolerance of players protesting during the playing of the national anthem, according to emails reviewed by The New York Times.

Gruden‚Äôs messages were sent to Bruce Allen, the former president of the Washington Football Team, and others, while he was working for ESPN as a color analyst during ‚ÄúMonday Night Football,‚Äù the sports network‚Äôs weekly prime-time telecast of N.F.L. games. In the emails, Gruden called the league‚Äôs commissioner, Roger Goodell, a ‚Äúfaggot‚Äù and a ‚Äúclueless anti football pussy‚Äù and said that Goodell should not have pressured Jeff Fisher, then the coach of the Rams, to draft ‚Äúqueers,‚Äù a reference to Michael Sam, a gay player chosen by the team in 2014.

In numerous emails during a seven-year period ending in early 2018, Gruden criticized Goodell and the league for trying to reduce concussions and said that Eric Reid, a player who had demonstrated during the playing of the national anthem, should be fired. In several instances, Gruden used a homophobic slur to refer to Goodell and offensive language to describe some N.F.L. owners, coaches and journalists who cover the league.

Gruden, Allen, the N.F.L., and the Raiders did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Although not with a team at the time, Gruden was still influential in the league and highly coveted as a coach. He had won a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers following the 2002 season. And in 2018, he was hired for his second stint as the head coach of the Raiders franchise, which includes defensive lineman Carl Nassib, the first active N.F.L. player to publicly declare that he is gay.

The league said last week that it shared emails with the Raiders in which Gruden made derogatory comments.

Gruden told ESPN on Sunday that the league was reviewing emails in which he criticized Goodell, and explained that he had been upset about team owners‚Äô lockout of the players in 2011, when some of the emails were written. Gruden said in that interview that had used an expletive to refer to Goodell and that he did so because he disapproved of Goodell‚Äôs emphasis on safety, which he believed was scaring parents into steering their sons away from football.

But Gruden‚Äôs behavior was not limited to 2011. Gruden exchanged emails with Allen and other men that included photos of women wearing only bikini bottoms, including one photo of two Washington team cheerleaders.

Gruden greeted defensive lineman Carl Nassib, who publicly announced he is gay in June.Ethan Miller/Getty Images Gruden also criticized President Obama during his re-election campaign in 2012, as well as then-vice president Joe Biden, whom Gruden called a ‚Äúnervous clueless pussy.‚Äù He used similar words to describe Goodell and DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the N.F.L. Players Association.

The league is already investigating Gruden as a result of another email he wrote to Allen in 2011 in which he used racist terms to describe Smith, who is Black.

In that email, Gruden, who is white and was working for ESPN at the time, criticized Smith‚Äôs intelligence and used a racist trope to describe his face. The correspondence was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by The New York Times.

The league, Smith, and Mark Davis, the owner of the Raiders, all denounced Gruden‚Äôs comments, but the coach thus far has not been penalized and he coached his team in its game on Sunday against the Chicago Bears. Gruden said Friday that he did not remember sending the email and that his language ‚Äúwent too far,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúI never had a blade of racism in me.‚Äù

Gruden's emails to Allen, who was fired by the Washington Football Team at the end of 2019, were reviewed as part of an N.F.L. investigation of workplace misconduct within the franchise that ended this summer. Goodell instructed league executives to look at more than 650,000 emails during the past few months, including those in which Gruden made offensive remarks. Last week, Goodell received a summary of their findings and the league sent the Raiders some of the emails written by Gruden.

In the exchanges, Gruden used his personal email account while Allen wrote from his team account. In some cases, Allen initiated the conversations and Gruden chimed in, while in other cases, they trade vulgar comments several times.

Some of the emails between Gruden and Allen also included businessmen friends, Ed Droste, the co-founder of Hooters; Jim McVay, an executive who has run the Outback Bowl, annually held in Tampa, Fla.; and Nick Reader, the founder of PDQ Restaurants, a Tampa-based fried chicken franchise. The exchanges begin as early as 2010 while Gruden was an analyst for ‚ÄúMonday Night Football.‚Äù In 2018, he signed a 10-year, $100 million contract to coach the Raiders.

Bruce Allen was fired by the Washington Football Team at the end of 2019.Andrew Harnik/Associated Press Droste, McVay, and Reader did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Gruden and Allen are longtime friends and colleagues. Allen was an senior executive with the Raiders from 1995 to 2003, when he worked with Gruden, who was head coach of the team from 1998 to 2001. Gruden became head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2002 and beat the Raiders in the Super Bowl that season. Allen became the general manager there in 2004. Allen and Gruden both left the Buccaneers after the 2008 season. While Gruden moved on to a broadcast role with ESPN, Allen became the general manager in Washington in 2010 and later the team‚Äôs president.

Taken together, the emails provide an unvarnished look into the clubby culture of one N.F.L. circle of peers, where white male decision makers felt comfortable sharing pornographic images, deriding the league policies, and jocularly sharing homophobic language.

Allen is the son of legendary N.F.L. coach George Allen, and Gruden ‚Äî whose father coached at Notre Dame and whose brother, Jay, was head coach in Washington from 2014 to 2019 ‚Äî are part of an exclusive network that cycles between N.F.L. teams, networks and companies affiliated with the league.

Their banter flies in the face of the league‚Äôs public denouncements of racism and sexism and its promises to be more inclusive amid criticism for not listening to the concerns of Black players, who make up about 70 percent of rosters. The N.F.L. has in the past struggled to discipline personnel who have committed acts of domestic violence and been condemned for failing to adequately address harassment of women, including N.F.L. cheerleaders.

In June, the N.F.L. congratulated Nassib after he became the first active N.F.L. player to publicly declare that he is gay. Goodell said he was ‚Äúproud of Carl for courageously sharing his truth today. Representation matters.‚Äù

Privately, Allen and Gruden appeared to have few boundaries in expressing homophobic and transphobic language. In one email from 2015 that includes Droste, McVay and others, Gruden crudely asked Allen to tell Bryan Glazer, whose family owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers where Gruden coached until 2008, to perform oral sex on him. Allen said Glazer would ‚Äútake you up on that offer.‚Äù

Allen and Gruden also mocked Caitlyn Jenner, who received an award from ESPN in 2015 after she transitioned.

In an email from 2015, Allen and Gruden criticized a congressional bill that aimed to force the Washington franchise to change its name, which some Native Americans and others have denounced as a slur. Again using a vulgar term, Gruden took aim at Goodell and his staff even though the commissioner had initially defended the team‚Äôs right to keep the name.

In 2017, Droste shared with the group a sexist meme of a female referee to which Gruden replied, ‚ÄúNice job roger.‚Äù

That same year, Gruden was sent a link to an article about N.F.L. players calling on Goodell to support their efforts promoting racial equality and criminal justice reform. Gruden had advice for Goodell:

‚ÄúHe needs to hide in his concussion protocol tent,‚Äù he wrote.

Interestingly, a lot of vegans are ok with you eating meat if you hunt and kill the animal yourself. In their view it's much more humane than what goes on in factory farms.

Lol for real, look at SPY‚Äôs 1 month chart. Or the 1 year
So Gruden called Goodell a flaming dick sucker and made an observation on lips.
Just have to deal with the boomer interface
‚ÄúFutures open lower , due to Jon gruden news ‚Äú
Sounds like you went somewhere to be an asshole on purpose. Congrats
*His ass
Look at the yearly chart. It's OpEx week, there's some general jitters, but we're currently trading above last month's low. It's rebounding between the 20day and 50day sma right now. Before the end of the week a decline of a few percent or so, possibly down into the 420s, would be in line with expectations for a normal sept/oct period in recent times... so yeah, could totally happen.

The pattern you're seeing on the one month chart from sept 28th through Oct 7th is a reverse head and shoulders pattern... very bullish.... basically a triple bottom. LOL

If we dip again and then rise up like last year, that period will be the head in a larger head and shoulders pattern.

That‚Äôs a problem almost everyone in here probably has lol. People in here think 2 paragraphs is torture. I read 1-2000 pages of material a week whether it‚Äôs work related or just for pleasure. Reading is good for your memory, allows you to retain more information the more you practice it.
At this rate there will only be 10k left buying fds by the EOW.
Is this a viable strategy?: buy long dated, way otm puts and buy weekly calls itm/atm or slightly otm? Or is this a losing strategy?
I thought Gruden was indigenous? He can‚Äôt be racist
IB is always the answer. Fuck it I'm making the jump
You got a FAANG internship thats tough except amazon they scoop up everyone
I like AMD Ryzen chips. So I buy their stocks to give them liquidity to operate and produce better Ryzen chips.

It has been about 15 years since Wall Street fueled a boom in high-leverage mortgages to risky borrowers and a suite of exotic, housing-related derivatives that imploded when home prices tumbled, taking down investment bank Lehman Brothers and prompting a wave of U.S. and European bank bailouts.

Since that time, big banks have been required by regulators to hold more capital against potential loan losses, but also briefly during the pandemic were temporarily prevented from buying back their own shares

I believe in a long-term recovery but I'm taking profit along the way wherever I can. Was up 10% at open and it was an easy sell.
What were you all doing in the ikea floor display at the same time?
Maybe but it‚Äôs only evening futures.   Could so easy flip by morning.
Holding it for the dividend is dumb and the reason why the boomers are making the mistake they are making.  It has a hypergrowth component that will be spinning off soon.  HBOmax shares are the prize.  Once the company cuts it's debt with the deal the whole company will rerate and the EV/ebita calculation changes and it will be very undervalued at that price so even holding T after the deal won't be bad.
I'm stiff

T has been an idea for a while.  They have a nice hyper growth component that will be handed out as a dividend as shares in a few months.  The people who used to own it care about yield and not how well the company is doing so you are getting an unusual discount for a large cap company as they bail.  When HBOmax rerates after the spin off it is expected that both the new hypergrowth company and T will get a better multiple and the opportunity to play that game is now while the boomers lock in their losses by selling.

This is the most annoying and pretentious Twitter account imo
So.. America.
Doing well man. My 10/18 435 puts bought at open today went from -45% to +33% by close and it looks like we might get a red open tomorrow if these futures hold. Girlfriend is about to make steak and mashed potatoes and we‚Äôre gonna watch some of this Billy Bob Thornton lawyer show on Amazon called Goliath. Pleasant day. How about you?
I regret not opening shorts eod
Futures red yesterday, and we closed red.
As always, b&gt;!****!&lt; r fuk

I used to follow the 10-year yield as a leading indicator, but I'm starting to think this country won't be around in 10 years.

Bravo my friend, bravo.
Thats true. I am just thinking about a massive body like the ccp operating as a financial one. This is the true face of corporatism, since this is impossible to be done under democratic regimes if there is no an ongoing crisis. Ccp knows very well that during a crisis a mixed economy will prevail over the liberal us market.

He's hinging on his assumption that the calls he's looking at are bullish and not a hedge against a bigger bear bet against a single ticker, or a spread of tickers that belong to the S&amp;P 500.
Legit last night we went down to -0.6% and the market opened green. 

Everyone here just believes what they want to
#Ban Bet

/u/VercingetorixIII made a bet that SPY would go to 433.4814 when it was 437.86 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Let‚Äôs go bears let‚Äôs go hoo hoo
What I said is the truth and if it hurts you should try thinking about it instead of wanting to get someone banned because you don‚Äôt agree with them. That‚Äôs pretty sad
It‚Äôs the new SPY call. Literally free money
And now, only on our specially constructed water stage - a daredevil plunge!  Breaking the surface of the water, *she can actually go below zero.*
Looks like we gon' have a good ol' fashioned -2% day tomorrow, boys. RIP calls.

Pretty sure Sept and Oct are usually the worst months for the market, even excluding market crash years.

It is. Chinese economy is very different, it is similar to the japanese keiretsu model. Furthermore, the evergrande founder and ceo is a party official. The government has a specific control over the private sector. Thats one of the bonuses of the authoritarian regimes.

You deserve it tbh man. Why would you be bearish when shit is that low? You could have made a killing being bearish on the US indexes like I did. It‚Äôs awesome not being blinded by racism/nationalism. Makes things really easy. Keep your emotions in check

Yes. You can find plenty of documented sources and videos on alternate news websites. 


Media is once again doing its thing and company lying. It‚Äôs regarding the vaccine mandate for all their employees including pilots


ATC will also likely be a factor so it‚Äôll affect more than just specific airlines currently they‚Äôre using bundled up sick time to go on strike. It‚Äôs why thousands just got stranded at airport across the country. They lie and say weather while other airlines fly same paths and peoooe in most areas have perfect weather.
It‚Äôs almost like none of this affects baba or most other Chinese stocks. Bears keep clinging to their racist hopes that aren‚Äôt real. It‚Äôs kind of adorable it‚Äôs like watching kids coming to terms with the fact that Santa isn‚Äôt real

I took a huge hit last Monday and Tuesday. I slowly went from 8k to 32k in September. Last Monday my account was at 32k by Wednesday it dropped to 7k. Then I went all in on spy calls exp Friday and got back up to 25k thursday morning lol. 

But today I bought calls in the morning, made some money, then I  bought and sold puts for small profits throughout the afternoon when I should have held those puts. I bought a couple of puts right on the last minute but I wish I bought more. Spy will go below that 427 wall I think. There is so much bad news with China issues, chip shortage, supply chain issues. I'm willing to bet that Apple will absolutely smash earnings but then they will bring up supply chain issues and the stock will drop. So far my winning strategy is swing trading spy options. I like when it picks a direction and holds it. Last monday and tuesday killed me because in the afternoons with traded within a narrow range and barely moved

It‚Äôs impossible to buy everything at the bottom without a little luck. That‚Äôs why I start DCA when it‚Äôs in my buy range. Baba at 200 is inanely cheap, under that wasn‚Äôt possible without collusion from the China racist gang on Wall Street. They did their worst and it wasn‚Äôt enough and never will be. Wish they would stay short so they can get bankrupted then we won‚Äôt have this problem again. People like soros Weiss and muddy waters need to go to the lake of fire and stop bothering us real investors
Now we know why it‚Äôs called SPY, it‚Äôs going to drill a hole straight to China and do some reconnaissance.

We don‚Äôt care if it goes back to 140 (it won‚Äôt) because we will have more money freed up by then and buy more. Everyone who was waiting for the bottom was buying when munger did. Banks started heavily accumulating in the 160s and 150s. No one is going to want to sell this low when the intrinsic value of baba is like 350 and soon to be over 400 with these incoming earnings beats.

Unbreakable support is at 132 due to multiple factors such as historical buy backs etc etc. that can‚Äôt break. 140 was the bottom dude it should have never even gone under 180.

Bears were legit lucky it went under that, it was a violation of fundamentals and it‚Äôs honestly sickening but I appreciate the buying opportunity.

Word of advice, valuations matter. Don‚Äôt short at the bottom, buy it instead. China will never not be a part of the global market.

Puts on UPS I guess.
Over time they always will unless China and US kill each other. Barring that highly almost impossible scenario everything should be fine.

It doesn‚Äôt matter.  It‚Äôs all just numbers.  People file for bankruptcy and come back 7 years later and live normally.  Life goes on, it‚Äôs hard for everyone.

They downsized their home and his wife got a second job.  They‚Äôre making it.

I'm tempted to do so. I am waiting on a bonus next month before I have enough. Most of my down payment for a house is currently in shares and I'm down 3k. I can't put it in a cd because of timing but savings is shit and homes keep skyrocketing. I'm fucked
I've fucked a couple chiros. Nothing special. A hole's a hole.

Yeah I remember losing my first 10k. It's just numbers yo
It's not a bad idea, heads I win tails you lose. You only get to keep your house (regardless of value) in a few states though, Florida for one.

My idea is to get a margin loan and buy a house for cash with it. Basically a 1% interest-only mortgage, and short-term rates aren't going up anytime soon.
I'm happy you guys like it. I'll try to expand it to more stuff, futures, whatnot. got interested in the flair stats instead

They're mad because they've had ample warning. Weeks in fact, to take the loss. Instead they doubled down, and now they have even heavier bags.
Honestly why not trade max margin and file bankruptcy if it goes bad? 


My friend filed bankruptcy for him and his wife 90k in credit card debt. Got to keep the house, cars, and have it wiped clean. Only thing is he has bad credit score for 7 years but again with the house and cars already who fucking cares?

It really depends on your issue. Chiropractor and deep tissue massage cured me from some serious shoulder girdle issues I was having from some soft tissue damage.
So, in actuality,  I'm sitting outside with my dog in front of a fire.having an old fashioned.  On 10 acres with a nice house. Wife is inside cooking. No debt other than the mortgage. And yet I'm ready to drink bleach over losing $10k that doesn't really change my life. Wtf is wrong with me
Hoping my buy orders on GME fill, sort of like fishing. Get paid on Friday so if the orders don't fill this week I'll just sprinkle a few more dollars onto each order on Friday.
This is too accurate

hi garbage, im dad.

Never. That's why PLTR filed the shelf offering a couple weeks ago, so they could randomly issue more shares any time the price rises above their desired price point. If the price drops below, they buy their shares back cheap using some of the $2.3B cash they have.

We'll almost certainly test the 200MA at 415, but yes if we dip below that then 380 is still possible. But honestly, anything between 380 and 415 is a good time to buy if you're going to double down on stuff you want to hold mid-long term.

Imagine if you just followed this cycle. 


Buying calls early, selling for modest 10-30% gains, then buying modest puts and selling those off slowly once they turn to profit at 10% or more. 


Imagine. You could make a lot of money if you just followed that plan and we‚Äôre pretty confident.

Haha, good one. There's a bunch of unrealistic expectations on the market and not everyone is a smart investor, I just didn't want people to invest their life savings into stocks or CC at the market top, and many of them did. I'm sure you're much too smart to make that mistake.
Anybody buying OMI?
Nice bro. Your sell early was okay. That‚Äôs capital preservation. You can always buy back. That is a good rule that I didn‚Äôt follow myself and suffered a brutal hit last week. Like if you want to hold because you think it‚Äôs so solid, eat the fees, sell then re buy. Your conviction will undoubtedly waiver and you‚Äôll not buy back, thus saving yourself from steeper losses. 


I did all of mine in first hour. What time did you?


I am finding continued success buying in the morning. Almost always calls. 


Bought 439 C exp Oct 13 for 2.11-2.13, sold for 2.75-2.85. About 35%, used about 100k here. 

I bought 440 C exp Oct 11 for .66 and .68, sold at .81 for 20%. Only used about 10k here. 

Bought these again shortly after at .72 and sold at .91 for 26%. Used 10k. 

I bought 436 P exp today for .50-.55 and sold .69 area. I only used about 10k here again for 30% or so. 


Why only use 10k? Nervous after big morning win. I didn‚Äôt want to buy. It looked good. But it was mostly a gambling itch. After the second win I was just testing the spy gods. 

Very good day after last weeks rough loss. 

Also sold TSLA held over weekend for a $4-5. Gain per share over 130 shares. Bought FB later in the day. 


Very close to buy puts again later in the day but IBKR doesn‚Äôt like me buying ops that expire in hours and I‚Äôve been burned not being able to buy the dip so I don‚Äôt want to do that and the movement of later this week puts wasn‚Äôt enough to justify the risk. Oh well. 

Made some money on CLOV calls just day trading the 8.5‚Äôs at .20 up to .25 ish. Not many though. Some other minor movements. Ended the day up about 60k with bulk of that attributable to SPY. 


Had some good wins after big loss last week but not full recovery until now. Almost over 300k now after starting with 10k, 12k cad 10k usd I think it was in end of august with intent to trade spy calls primarily. I added 20k more though to sell some puts. 


So if I‚Äôm close to 300k with 30k ish in, 270 up. Sept was better because ended that up 2000% as the original 10 to 200. Now the % gains will look less extreme as I get too nervous. 


It does suck though when you see that you could‚Äôve bet your main pot of 200 and gotten 2-3x more. I had some soy positions option simultaneously though which is why I stopped doing all in on calls so I could jump into other directions or strikes if needed. Has worked so far.
So what is SOFI? Like a bank for retards?

I still feel like spy has some room down to go but honestly there are some really good deals right now in the US market. Qualcomm is trading a standard deviation in p/e below what is usually the bottom of the channel for them and crispr is looking insanely cheap for the growth that‚Äôs coming for their sector over this decade. This leads me to believe spy isn‚Äôt going under the 405 gap since there‚Äôs quite a few stocks that have already bottomed for the US.

well shite, not rly much of a spoiler when you actually catch up
I think we hit 408 by EOW
it‚Äôs not a bad move at all, man. puts have paid for months. though it‚Äôs getting harder and harder to see a lot of meat on the downside as risk drops with price. mostly I‚Äôd look for quick volatility trades and then opportunities to go long on OTM leap calls for a reversal. there will probably be reaction into the mid-teens, if not closer to $20 eventually. things tend to see at least lower highs on giant moves like the run to $28

The only competitor to TSLA is Apple Cars. I guarantee you every Tesla owner will switch to an Apple car if it comes out because they are conditioned to buy Apple products. Poor people will take out a loan and live in their Apple cars if that's what it takes to afford one. The only way for TSLA to win is if their car can actually FSD and it becomes legal by the time Apple comes out with their car. I would rather own an Apple car than a Tesla since Tesla are way too common now and I trust Apple's design to be stylish and clean.
Probably not, but it will get closer than a lot of people would like

America is about making money. Buying puts rn is actually the patriotic thing to do üá∫üá∏
Actually more risk in a sense. Deep otm options aren't priced appropriately for fat tail events, which translates to premiums being discounted (making them better buys) when compared to near/atm options. What makes people think that they're more risky, and rightly so, is that they don't usually hit. However, the risk to reward favors buying them because, like I mentioned above, they're discounted relatively. That being said, I do not recommend applying the same amount of your portfolio. It's one of those less is more type situations.
Have another toke or six, you know, to spur your curiosity.

Yeah but that‚Äôs basically unaffordable for 99% of this sub
TNX is up .56% today, which should tell you something about the bond market.
I heard a rumor about a food and materials shortage in the upcoming months

Bought the wife a carpet cleaner today, like a nice heavy duty one people usually or used to rent.  Didn‚Äôt expect her to be this pumped.  Def got a good one

I always enjoy a good masturbation session on optionsprofitcalculator.com
If they're for volatility, why are you buying atm? You'd get better returns on otm due to gamma rapidly pushing up the premium.
I disagree with that narrative. March-July 10 year was just as high, and higher. This is a recurring narrative. 10 year rips, SPY dips, fears wear off SPY gaps back up. If we gap down tomorrow I would base that more on the downtrend technicals with no positive catalysts in sight.
The whole world economy will crash two days before the day after tomorrow!
Titties are for big bets that are going tits up üòè

I've been feeling this since last week. I think today would have been lower if the bond market was open, and TNX was up .56% today, while the major indexes were down. Not a good thing for equities, and it kinda tells me what the whales are thinking.

Today I learned gains r short lived and reversal can happen at anytime for no reason, soon as u make some gains, sell that mf 

better to miss out on a higher upside than potentially lose over 60% from holding
was omw to the Braves game today and decided not to buy the SPY 438 puts i was eyeing at 10:30am this morning

its possible merger gets announced tonight. unless something with the merger changed there wont be a phase 3. phase 2 ended last week but golden week (china holiday) prevented any announcements.  china announces approvals on tuesdays. they could still extend phase 2 another 60 days

Futures are DRILLING. 

Bull r fuk
Oh yeah I mean you are getting banned not that it wasn‚Äôt up
Then switch again
Yeah man fuck Wendy's never go back to that shit. Remember Arby's isn't a job, it's a family. We're so happy to have you as a member! ü•≥
Those women have names you know.

They‚Äôre called lot lizards.

This is the only funny one. The rest suck.

Just wanted to announce: I've decided I'm not gonna be a bitch and ask for my old job back. Imma fight thru the trenches and learn to adapt at my new job. Thanks all
Its deleted because WISH is a steaming pile of shit.
#ENERGY!!
I would love if the stock market would just generally go in the upward direction like we've always been led to believe. It just feels wrong to bet on stocks going down.  I've done it, but still
You can still quit
LOL this guy doesn‚Äôt know about extended hours options, where all the real money is made

SPY is a hoe
I'd honestly jump ship unless it's your dream job or something.
I want a thanksgiving right now :(


Sounds so good
Lmao ü§£.  Cramer says ‚Äúbuy Wendy‚Äôs‚Äù
This is first date convo material. Ladies get v wet when dudes talk about ‚Äúthe gay agenda‚Äù in comic books.
That's ones a hard 50/50 , if one bank tanks then the rest are going to go along with it
or maybe just quit your job and take the new one???
I‚Äôm trying to find any play with odds in my side. The calls did work early but it turned sour. 

Bulls are fucked üêÇüî´

You guys wanna see QQQ at 350 tomorrow? Because we most likely will.

Smaller condoms
They probs just put less filling in all their shit and charge the same.
LOL This dude actually called Cramer to ask about Wendys
Lmao lads i just started my new job like not even a month ago and I get offered another position with a 40% raise from what I‚Äôm making now. Guess I shoulda been more patient üòÇ
Cramer is a human stroke
$AMD- Outperforming market and weakening the resistance. Just needs a green day for market to break out of $107.2 resistance and run to $110.
Happy Thanksgiving!!! Fellow Canadians.  Hope you had a great day feasting on tendies and treats!

How can a comic book character come out as gay? They're wriiten by someone so if you really think about it they were forced to be gay, which took away all choice. 

Edit: I'm drunk
Damn one day bull and you gave it up lol. But I can see why
Exactly. Default happens, nothing happens, everyone realizes panic selling was for nothing, moon.
Wtf

This is a new situation for the 2 of you to encounter.
Lay off the meth fren
That‚Äôs a mistake.
you got 24h. The avg. workday is 8h. The avg. sleep time is 8h. 

1. No sleep gives you the full 24h
2. Use the 80/20 principle (roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes)
3. 24/8 = you got 3 avg. workdays of time
4. with 80/20 you get 80% of a normal 1h result in just 12 minutes. (60m\*0.2=12m)
5. You can fit 5 times the amount of work into 1 normal hour (60m/12m = 5)
6. 24\*5= 120h = you got 15 workdays of time left

TLDR: sit back relax, you still got 15 days until deadline.
wait we both have small penis flairs
It's been a fckn genocide for weeks
I bought 3/18 $52.50 calls
did you try sticking your micro-penis inside it
I miss the old daily SPY gap up time.   bring it back plz
If tomorrow holds we could see a couple more modest days up to 20.5 EOW. Or market FUD could catch it and pull it down to the 17s again. Hard to say, tomorrow will be a big day for you.
NO FEAR ‚úäüò≠
What is with the feet and no titty?
So much for the $DOLE thesis. Currently 56% down on an 19-Nov $17.50 Calls. BUY MORE BANANAS YOU APES.
Holy fuck 450 pulls up a day hurts. Probably gotta lower to 200 - 300
I‚Äôm only here to tell you mf that my crush said she liked me back
I‚Äôll trade whatever makes me money, don‚Äôt care about the ticker
posting your positions on clov to hedge funds probably not the best idea.  what do i know my portfolio is way down hiding my positions...
Lol I hope you were researching magic wands and spells cuz that‚Äôs about your last chance to breakeven it looks like
Damn spy last min drop really helped recover losses

I dont know what to do anymore
I get you. I was only down 900 but I felt bad cause i put down my dog over. 3,000 vet bill. He was old and with diabetes. Well, at least you can roll over 3K a year towards your gains in the following years.
She was an eager beaver. I think he‚Äôs a happy soul lol

I bought 439 puts for 10/13 around 10am then went to sleep (night shift), woke up to 150%ish profit and sold them at close, don't have the balls to hold overnight with these fuckin 1.5% recoveries.

It sure is nice being a steel and oil bull

I got that "excited/scared" feeling. Like 98% excited, 2% scared. Or maybe it's more - It could be two - it could be 98% scared, 2% excited but that's what makes it so intense, it's so - confused. I can't really figure it out.

Most beta thing I‚Äôve ever read
He can't give me a counter offer without getting it signed off on by senior leadership but does plan too.  Problem is it is 33% increase in pay which is hard to pass in our corporation and I am going from increasingly stacking global responsibility to a company that only has two facilities.  So I don't think he can really match.
They wouldn‚Äôt just cancel each other out, one makes money while the other loses? But I‚Äôll try it next time I get a little cash on hand. Right now I‚Äôm just holding my Dec 31 call that I should make money on but currently down 120 on

Don't put any text after the time token (1m, 1w, 15d) if you don't intend to carry out an interesting punishment to get unbanned early.

It‚Äôs an options strategy where you buy a call and put at the same strike so you profit when the position moves a good bit in either or direction
I think there was a user that already had a ban bet expire. Is there a place where we can see the result
How much is left?

Yeah, 28 with a job that‚Äôs just under 6 figures and my losses amount to like 8k if things don‚Äôt turn around, so I‚Äôll be fine in the long run. It‚Äôs more the fact that the wife is unaware and may become aware come tax time. I might have some splainin to do. Lol

PS- most of my positions have weeks left on them. Plenty of time for things to turn around. Not my CLOV puts tho. Those expire Friday. Not giving up on those just yet either tho. Hopefully that shit dies tomorrow.
Best way to lose it all, indeed
Not necessarily, if he bought them towards close and held them till 2-4pm today he would've either broke even or made 100%
I mean it's already up 50% for the month. I'll take my chances
I'll be in my hotel room. Naked. Room 302. Don't keep me waiting

Bulls r fuk. This is your last chance to load up on puts. If I don't see you with a dick in your mouth by 9:30 tomorrow morning you have no one to blame but yourselves. You have been warned.
at least give me a exit point
Lol bet you did but even then your avg can‚Äôt be that much lower than what I‚Äôm expecting. I think a 2,000% gain at most would net you 20% gain overall
So open a straddle
Don‚Äôt pay attention to them they like to go in blind
Don't think theres any danger of that, Don't know anything about stocks lol

Don't feel bad. I literally did the the same thing February 2020. Got wiped out, said F this market and came back (boomer 401k) in June and really started throwing big money in my brokerage account feb 2021. Im 29 but my boomer ass payed off my house in the meantime, I can afford to yolo on some options if I see a nice correction. For now I sell CC and Puts and rarely get excersize except for this past week I got excercized for 10.5 TLRY and it was 10.49 EOD. O well. More CC I can sell
Itll be ok the bears won't win... I hope

I held calls all weekend. I just have Oracle calls and a Spy Strangle

Just got a weighted blanket hoping it would help me sleep more than 4 hours and it's fucking amazing

Oof. Yeah, Ive done that a couple times now. The $3k in an hour salute. Its where you just sit and stare at your screen praying for a turn around while saluting it just to pay it respect

I'm up 16% on 38 QQQ option trades over the past 2 weeks. If I can keep this up for just 4 more months, I can recover all my losses since I opened my Robinhood account in 2016.
I sold my SPy calls for around 4000 profit around then and almost rolled it all into puts but I was being a pussy and only did a little. Mainly because Ameritrade commission is .65 per contract üò¨
So everyone ready to get burned on jack's next P&amp;D (CLOV)?
Air for dinner definitely made me chuckle. Reminds me of the extra scene in Stepbrothers where Brennan is eating ice with mustard on it, and he's like "That was a bad piece of ice."

I lost 3k in 1 hour today. Fuck me. Shit immediately drilled lower after I bought

Anyone who would have considered that play doesn't have 3000
lol I do that all the time. Go back and look at its previous value and think "had I went all in here". But the truth is, no one goes all in "there". Judging by the volume anyways. I bought 10 calls one day and sold for $200 profit. Had I held 30 more minutes it would have been $10k...
Wait that doesn't just automatically happen every time?

My dad went broke in the 80s shorting oil and got margin called on his book. Wasn‚Äôt a good look for him. He hated oil ever since. He died 9 years ago and when oil had the 25% gap down March 9, 2020, it was that mother fuckers birthday. I will never forget that and the moral of the story is, don‚Äôt short oil, because most likely, you won‚Äôt see the trade work until after you‚Äôre dead.

Seems like some analysts are expecting 90-100 (Goldman and BofA), even before factoring in an aggressive winter. And oh yeah, OPEC loves to get together and watch everyone invested in oil collectively shit themselves, but even with current prices they've stuck to measured increases rather than reevaluating, but that could certainly change with a move to 90-100 per barrel.
So who's that cat with the coins around here?

It‚Äôs just to play off of the IV. Since stocks are on a negative trend volatility is rising = higher option premiums. If you want the best bang for your buck you need to buy further dated options to get a lower IV. At the same time you will see substantial gap ups (just look at spy chat for the last month). Just buy itm/atm Calls on large down days.

You‚Äôre overestimating the effects. The assumptions and rise in price now are already factoring in those scenarios to an extent. We would need not only a bad winter but a substantial move from Nat gas use to heating oil demand. It‚Äôs a risky move not to mention OPEC can come Flood the market at any given time. They meet at the beginning of each month making oil investors bite their nails in anticipation. We‚Äôre entirely at their mercy. However as you mentioned, if the winter truly is bad we could see $90 a barrel crude, I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked. But any spike above that range and closing into triple digits would most likely cause OPEC to open taps to prevent shale from coming back online
I think so too

Crude oil today highest since 2014, natural gas shortage, cold winter expected, anyone else watching oil-related stocks? A little odd that many of them just don't seem to be reacting to news, but any sort of winter as chaotic as the last one (snowstorms and blackouts even as far south as Texas) could wreak havoc on our need for natural gas and oil, unless I'm missing something or overestimating these effects.

Towards the end of the day, those same puts were over 4.00...I'd feel a lot more comfortable holding through those dips if my account was a lot bigger. I only traded spy options expiring today.

Then again though we will probably pump like a mofo tomorrow for 0 reason at all
Same
The 700 point rally better happen before I get a chance to set up my $ROPE.
Slap myself for buying options .
Your mom loves anal sex 

May the algos of FB$ bless her and bring many lads to her only fans
Bought $18 puts at the top. They were cheap because of the insane spike that happened.
SHORT ALL THE BOUNCES

MULTI YEAR BEAR MARKET

DIGITAL SHITCOINS ROLLING OVER TOO
Bears and bulls, bring that same energy tomorrow and everyone can win again.
Vro you hit a 7.5 bagger. Take da dub mayne. Chasing what coulda been would send you down a spiral
Hanging on to my SDC calls and crying.
you bears just never learn your lesson huh? watch spy be up 3% up by eow
„ÄΩÔ∏è
Don‚Äôt fuck with the Santa Claus rally, it‚Äôs tradition.

Uh doing what?
Your numbers are sus
Fuck me
Well the gap is filled and my calls are basically worthless so let‚Äôs see what the fuck happens
Im starting to think green days are a thing of the past,  every time we pump now its a damn trap
Lol you guys are rarely right. Bulls are in the right to tell ya'll to shut up and sit in the corner.

So the supply chain backlogs help increase energy prices because of scarcity. Normally this would decrease demand but demand is also through the roof cuz of reopening and stimulus and likely will increase more with the upcoming huge infrastructure spending bill. This is basically inflation (transitory or not) and you hit the nail on the head: energy is one of the best plays in an inflationary environment
The more it goes down, the better off we are* 

*To a point
Fuck you, I can't believe you bought calls with your own money

My IWM puts don't like that. I'd rather see -3 or -4% tomorrow and recovery Wednesday plz
Did you want the same level of investment ability as El Salvador &amp; Tonga? Hard fucking pass.
My english no good but I know FUBO stock veli good will make me millionaire
i never wrote something this angry when we made money consistently both directions, mainly calls - especially on the daily V recovery overnight /ES futures... but yea i do kinda feel like a twat right now
Can someone do a Risita subbed video on the price action of today? Pls
At least let them have their copium. Don‚Äôt be cruel!

Everyone spamming the shit out of it last night
$420 by the end of the week.
You knew where she was all this time, Brian.

Why play dumb?
Imagine somehow getting offended when other people buy calls with their own money and ranting online about it
&gt; How bloody is it finna be tomorrow mayne?

I‚Äôm gonna guess we see a recovery tomorrow, followed by red Wednesday.
I'm bull, and hold over 100k in SPY leaps.

That said, this shit going doesn't look good. I could see us hitting 420 easy and maybe even 400 before we normalize here.
And then will rise like Phoenix !
We aren‚Äôt going to see that kind of price movement again, probably ever. Need to start getting your calls a little closer to ITM.
No you're the stupid one
You don't consider a 7% drop in two days tanking?
THE ALGOS ARE THE NEW FORMS OF GODS AMONG THE HUMANS !!!!



Holy fuck how powerful these social media companies are !!!

I'm an idiot, so of course I did.
SQ $245 by EOW would be bigggggg money. So naturally it's gonna tank. Sorry guys
Money is just as easy to make nowadays if you're willing to short above the 50.
The bull market is over until SPY is back under 200. Ye üåà bulls have been warned
Drink some lemonade and go outside
Every stock down 5-10%, spy down .72%
I think it's just all play and fun. Why you take it so personal you guhdamn snowflake
How bloody is it finna be tomorrow mayne?
For 4 hours tops
MARA is way better miner.
In times like these I always ask, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Gabby?‚Äù
Every time someone says bers r fuk, SPY drops $1. You've been warned.

CLOV puts could be the move this week, with a good entry, if it signals another dump. that‚Äôs been fairly predictable and profitable as long as you wait and watch

That's me. It's cool though. I'm paying more attention to sdc tanking

So what‚Äôs up with HTZZ

$20 for a scratcher seems cheap compared to $100 for a SPY option right?
Idk. That seems too obvious in this cracked out market. We probably dive at open and crank up like 2% half an hour before close.

This is terrorism.
The whole market would collapse lol
Absolutely rude. Why
Swear to god when I stop buying SPY calls this bitch is gonna yeet to 455 in 3 days.
I say carbonated soft drink
Maybe learn to read before only buying spy calls regardless of market conditions. Get fucked you losers. I fucking love it so god damn much. Hope y'all lose all your money. Day after day listening to you dribbling cunts talking about ber fuk.

The amount of retard behind comments about buying calls is just unfathomable. You get what you fucking deserve. "Omg, you have to learn stuff about the market to make money?" Reading a chart? That's all fairy dust bullshit says the motherfucker who never bothered to learn a thing and is surprised when they can't correctly time the market. Who could have fuckin thought.

Fuckin retard leading the retard. Technical analysis is a self fulfilling prophecy. If everyone uses it, that makes it true. I'm sure since you don't understand, that makes it all bullshit of course. Check the fucking spy daily chart and tell me how bullish that motherfucker looks fucking idiots HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°

I lowkey felt this
Get a temporary second job. 17k is a few months of work
Anything is possible if you put your mind to it and try hard enough
It's been 84 years, and I can still smell the ATH. Calls never expired worthless. Tech was flying. The casino was called the Ship of Dreams, and it was.
Soon my friend, we will be above 30
I'm not asking for one but I've been seeing people mention it
The scandal is priced in. Today‚Äôs red day was because of oil prices affecting overall market outlook. But red days may continue if yields continue to go up
If the bond market opens up and tanks will spy rocket?
SPY calls were the move to flip today until they weren‚Äôt. So rather than touching puts I‚Äôd like see flat-ish consolidation so I can sell for credit instead of risking debit
SDC. Something is really strange going on. Fees jump from 15 to 80% right at market closed.

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/SDC
Should of sold my BABA calls at open yikes
Lol liquidity isn't a problem at all right now. What are you on about?
I had a green day, is it possible there is a way to play the stockmarket that isn't SPY?
It's overvalued
I bought spy before it was cool
What part of the Midwest do you live in?
NGL I kinda miss the days where spy dipped monthly and bounced off the 50dma
Nope, after earnings imo

I do vent a lot. I've applied to about 50 more jobs just this past day or two. I'm sorry to annoy you with my posting, I'll stop doing it. I'm always exhausted from work and so find it hard to study but am always able to apply here and there and am hoping for a miracle I guess.

I guess I'm still stuck between 420 and 450. Used to buy 100 shares and a few contracts for less than 25k, and it's been insane growth since then that has always felt like a bubble. (I don't think it is)

Netflix is a golden short opportunity.  ATH over hype of one show.  Will have negligible impact on long term growth which was already slowing.  Rest of FAANG getting hit with higher rates and will continue to.  Netflix will have a lot of catching up to do once the euphoria tops out.

That, and squid games. I honestly don‚Äôt even think their gaming move did much.

ATTN BULLS: I hesitated at the last minute on buying 440c into close. Your calls will now be safe.
Has your mom heard of Gamestop?  Yeah most likely.  Has your mom heard of Clover Health Care?  No?  They are not the same thing, not even close.  GME pulled in investors that had never owned stock in their lives.  Full disclosure I have no position in either of these, but I usually wait for GME to have a run and then sell call spreads.  Just wanted to defend myself against ape shit.
Thought I got the bottom of SQ when I bought those calls.

Narrator: *He did not in fact get the bottom*
There is very little resistance at these levels, 4300 could be imminent

I did buy calls but after it had already swung into negative, and a very small amount so didn't lose much. I would not be surprised if many took the 440 break as bullish and average up, though

Just gonna watch SPY to see how it trades early. It filled in the gap created last Thursday, so I want to see if it will bounce off resistance so i can make a play on SPX for weds exp.

Are you lifting heavy enough weight that it causes your grip to fail before your arms? If grip failure is not a problem you don't really need wrist straps for something like deadlift.

However if you're lifting heavier weights for your size you'll find that your hands tend to fail before the rest of you does- the straps solve that problem.

In other words: Do you need them? If not then don't use them. They aren't exactly a necessary accessory until you start lifting a bit heavier.

When is the right time to go all in on 4k AMZN calls
Yessirr!! That is the Way! $SDC Baby!üí∏üí∞
blew up my account today so my moves tomorrow will be filing for bankruptcy
My asshole is broken all the way. Market is full of people taking profit and only buying going on is Algos manipulating to unwind risk and 401k funds on autopilot.
It was a swing of over 1% back down from the high though, that's hard on any portfolio in options

Edit: Any portfolio with calls that is
I went from down -40% to up 8%
Guaranteed? Ban bet it
gashed depending on if we find a bottom overnight
Had a bad feeling about SQ. Dumped out at open
Guh...
Get the f out man you down 99% already

Whistling past the graveyard until Halloween and the reaper gets me
Or 11/19 C450 like me
whens next stimulus check
You get inside
Yeah just got tired of the false sense of hope. I may get back in but just had to cut ties and start fresh
Went from being up 36% to down 31% lol
can we just talk about pegging without bringing politics into it jesus christ
All I have to do is double my money ten days straight and I‚Äôm a millionaire
This shit ain't transitory
Need more of a drop before I buy this dip for earnings
+13$ after trading all day, and beeing up 3k earlier. ü¶òü¶òü¶ò
Ayo fuck christopher columbus
Added more 10/15 spy puts at 440. They tripled in value
Just keep shorting the bubble dont be a puss. Gains for past 5 weeks going on 6 weeks have been gnarly
I mean it‚Äôs hard to say anything is ‚Äútanking‚Äù at S&amp;P 435 but loving the increased volatility
SPX and VIX going to be traded 24 hours next month, so everyone on WSB can show their autism all day.

Just an random selection of stocks mentioned here often, does this look like a red day to you?
Did you get rid of your CLOV bags?
2021 has been a bear market you oblivious pig. faang is the only reason why you arent aware lf it
WHERES THE LOSS PORN? LET ME SEE IT! INJECT IT INTO MY VEINNSSSSS
bc of worldly reasons
[deleted]
I did well enough today I'm literally not gonna be here tomorrow. And the craziest part that I still probably sold early.
I‚Äôm hoping it doesn‚Äôt happen because I have some 3 month out calls but everything is pointing to it!
Very possibly yes
LFG SDC
Hecho en cheena
stop being so aggressive please
You realize we were below 430 less than a week ago right?
Oh yeah I did
I made $2k by day trading CXCI but fucking FB keeps dropping and lost $2k nowüòÇ
Sofi Ah whyüòÖ
You sold nio?
All I have to do is make 30% in a day 20 days in a row and I'll be a millionaire
Bro please stop lol
Bonds are gonna finish spy off tomorrow
Got my nuts soundly kicked in today
Just be careful that it's always tempting to fall into one camp or the other. We ended the day 0.7% lower - not such a big drop to warrant all these '1929, party is over' and other dramatic comments.

Follow the trend, it can switch at any point. Unlike the roulette, this game offers you a slim chance at an educated guess.

Having said that, my 10/13 437p bought earlier today are already printing, ready to drop them and ride the wave upwards once the trend switches.
I bought more 10/15 puts when it was at 440. They tripled in value
SOFI carried portfolio up 6% today
Start banging the dudes on the inside.
When will AMZN moon?
Am I doing this right. $SNDL. I bought 1,000 contracts at $1.5 for 2cents each.
11am down -30% üò≥  
Close up +16% üòé  
Edit: SPY AAPL puts
Any reason why market was down today ? Got some 436 calls for 13
So many big plays and everyone's focused on futures and SPY crab walking off a cliff ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Bulls destroyed, I was slowly peeling all my long calls all day but QQQs fucked me a bit. 

SQ what a POS
irnt? it was 15$ in jan and now $6. and its irnt? are u guys this stupid irl? it never squeezed
We really gonna go below 434 AH
[deleted]
Bullish on ghost cities. Wish we had those here.
**[F]**
Surprised ELY has been getting beat down as bad as it has lately
Trynna do both and losing money. Wish, FB and GOOG, all getting cucked
Boeing is gonna shoot to 270 soon.  dancing with the 200 MA
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)fr i didn't even notice it was a red day ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
To 428
Took a 20% haircut on some spy calls at open. Closed out and waited for the dip. Took another 20% haircut on those. 

Hoping for TSLA bankruptcy or spy ath overnight. 

At least I‚Äôm no longer holding out hope for NiO and slowly bleeding out for weeks
Asperger‚Äôs with downs
BRB, gonna hit the gym so I can get as strong as SPY's resistance to $440
Statistically, tomorrow should be a +1% day
Red monday like i said, green tommorow
I‚Äôm with you on this!
Damn, today was a pure bull massacre and this is only the beginning.
Can‚Äôt believe no one‚Äôs talking about SOFI
Today was a great day only lost 95% usually I lose it all.
3:59 sell volume set a very clear message for a little follow through
I had a green day, you did not?
again. what? up 30% last week down 7% today. cool. cant handle volatility? gtfo
Irnt 2.0
So Moderna starts at below $300 to start today, gets pumped to $314 and ends the day losing money sitting at 305? 

My two  315 10/22 calls keep getting fucked by this market manipulation b.s.
Prog!
At least there‚Äôs nothing happening in the Asian markets‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.oh wait
[deleted]
Hey thanks man. I appreciate the advice!
Green day for the first time in a month ü•≥
We are definitely entering a bear market in the next 3 months. DOW has been flatlining for 6 months. SPY has reached its ATH and is now doing a slow reversal. Money is being pulled from stocks and into bonds and precious metals. The energy crisis is going to only get worse. Hedge wisely.

Not to mention earnings which will really show how much growth has slowed down.
This shit can't keep tanking like this. Lol
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641) "we told them that we had to sell because it was a 'conflict of interest,' and they believed us!"
Wow that was ugly
440 to 434 lmao
March 2020 vibes, we're just hanging out here in mid-air like Wile E Coyote with a big fat Evergrande Canyon below.
I think we see a bounce back and I can cash in tomorrow at market open.
agree. Considering the current boom in the energy sector, I think $FCEL is really cheap at current price
SDC üò≠
It's going to blow through 434 at this rate.
Bout to load up on spy puts for tomorrow
[deleted]
Not if you‚Äôre anywhere close to middle class. If so, you always lose
Around midnight I think. Futures of course.
I can't feel my butthole after that close today.
QQQ -0.11% AH and timberracing
This Retard is  buying more $SDC @ Discount, all the FUD and calm comes before SS, get in and get rich! Or not! Simple! üë®‚ÄçüöÄüë©‚ÄçüöÄüöÄüí∞
May have to liquidate everything at open tomorrow and wait to pick my move. Confident I'll make some money, but these current picks may not be winners.
reevaluate life choices until market open and repeat mistakes
[deleted]
you named your right and left hands?
YEAH THAT'S THE MOVE
It‚Äôs still going
Down like 3% today.  Bears trying to ruin this for us normies.
I trade pm because I have 9-5 and because I'm used to getting up at 4am

I sometimes close in AH because I forgot to close between 9:30 and 4

When I do either of those price doesn't change but if many like me do that then price will
Well I discovered I needed to buy 10x my 10/15 420p to salvage the rest of the carnage in my account but at least it stemmed the bleeding
Bring back 2020.
Spy still diving
Back up we go tomorrow, guaranteed. Probably +1.5% on QQQ
Fucking amazing finish![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
It could be worse, you could have 450s like me
This market being held up by paperclips man its crazy
Yearly stimulus checks going out. $1,114 this time, not great, but not shabby.

Oh most of you don‚Äôt live in Alaska? That‚Äôs too bad.
I'm definitely gonna wake up to more blood tomorrow üôÅ
I was inches away from dropping $17 (waiting for it to go to $15 ü§°) $438 put, and it went up to over $300 by eod, RIP, maybe being a care bear is worth it sometimes
Lucky bastard. I haven't seen green in weeks.
And we'll all have puts and make a fortune, right?
Idk what the support is supposed to be for SPY but 435 seemed very meaningful to breach.
I bought some PLTR at the literal top today. So this is how it feels, huh?
Not today looks like 7.75 coming
you think we roll net 120+ on ES.Z21 by then? good luck
sour hour cleaned me
RIP
Are we ded yet
Absolutely DRILLING AH. Holy shit this actually the recession continuing. Possible circuit breakers here on out. Fuck‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
We need to make FCEL meme again, there are way more retarded tickers mooning right now!
Why are you still buying the dip‚Ä¶
Well. Another ATH today for my port! Moves tomorrow entirely depends on what rates do tonight.
Unofficially? So I'm only *unofficially* homeless now?
[deleted]
-1% by open on SPY
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
the insane thing is that SPY is not even 5% from ATH after all these drops lol

Anyone shit in their pants like the dude from Heels?
Sdc closing at $6.12
I guess I‚Äôll keep holding this MRK and AMD debit spreads‚Ä¶
Shit where did I save my SPY 420 memes.

Book profit with TTM
Yeah?
Well good news is my 401k contribution won‚Äôt be at ath
It goes in waves. I love looking at old financial papers because they did the same shit we do, just kept the wife's boyfriend and cocaine out of it.
Don‚Äôt worry about what others think of you, use straps if grip is a limiting factor and go about your day
BULLS MURDERED
My SPY calls got filled seconds until close so GUH
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Very bullish close, love it. ‚ù§
My 10/15 440‚Äôs don‚Äôt feel so good right now.
Don't take advices from this club
SPY up 0.1% and all small and midcaps -5-10%: wsb: you don't know what a dip is

SPY down 0.7% and midcaps/smallcaps allmost all green: wsb: end of the world, markets are down
The downtrend is so obvious that even Superman became a üåàüêª today
that rug pul at close brought a tear to my eye ü•≤

just beautiful to see bul get fuk like that so suddenly
I mean what sort of financial education would u need to see this shit coming
Another day another close below the 100
The spread is fucking nuts like 2x the # of calls
wow glad i didn't trade today 

(I couldn't trade today bc I blew my account up on Friday and I'm waiting for funds to transfer btw)
[deleted]
üòÇüòÇ Those calls trading for .05 but you probably have to sell on bid for .04
Thank you, MMs for dropping the markets at close on no new news, to trigger my GOOGL 2900c buys at a discount, two weeks before another blowout earnings.
naw
Raise your hand if you bought calls EOD and don‚Äôt regret it? 

Ok now lower your hands you fucking liars
Well...430 at open tomorrow?? Fuk....
Ended up $17 in the green today lmao
you will regret that tomorrow‚Ä¶ will be green
Sick
Rates flyyyy, btw when do they open lol
Tomorrow, roll out of bed around 7, walk the pup, make some espresso, realize how fucked everything is, and watch these QQQ puts and UVXY calls print.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553)
SPY won‚Äôt let me get any pussy üòû
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
$FCEL
I really miss the old SPY
Just another day of indexes casually dropping over 1% from their daily high.  Not a statistical anomaly for this to happen every day for like 3 weeks or anything.  Totally normal nothing to see here move along
Vix did a perfect cup and handle holy sht lol
Don't worry, SPY is still going to keep dropping. I have yet to have my fill of salmon. As long as those fuckers keep trying to swim upstream, Imma keep eating them.
Buy FAANG or be a penny flipper. The only way to make money.
Question!? What makes the stock price changes pre and after market besides the news?
a holiday
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Closed out my SPY puts for $$$. Talked myself out of Sophie puts at close. Mostly cash gang with a few lottos. Think I'm gonna take my ball and go home for the week. Godspeed and God bless.

#THIS WEEK WAS FUN!
*Aftermarket enters the chat
just like your wife's panties
See I would get downdooted for that

Recession incoming. Trade accordingly
Yeah but its fun to gamble as close to that drop as possible

BULL ASHES
Well. Another ATH today for my port! Moves tomorrow entirely depends on what rates do tonight.
If Christopher Columbus would‚Äôve stayed his ass in Spain, I wouldn‚Äôt need to be here working a 9-5
You think that‚Äôs bad wait for tomorrow üíÄ
How strong do you have to be to use wrist straps in the gym and not look like a try hard?
Oh we doin 1929 stylie huh
Yeah even the 440c is discounted right now!
Buying calls on inverse ETFs doesn't make you a bear because you're still buying calls. Think of it as the financial equivalent of shouting "no homo" right before eating the ookie cookie.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
I know technical analysis is astrology for dudes - but when you see that gap get perfectly filled like today you start to believe‚Ä¶. Bank earnings better be off the charts to get out of this downtrend
Fellow bears, this is why we always stay the course with Puts on a downtrend!
+ 5k CLOV
$405 open
How far down, LUV? How far down are you willing to go?
Burry is feeling really üåà
It apparently gives no fks
Bulls still can‚Äôt figure it out.  The party is over
I swear shorting is getting a bigger practice with stocks
SPY didn't dip enough to make me wanna spend much on calls today so I just picked up a 2/18 515c for like $19 at EOD. Still available after hours if you want one
At least this is the bottom!
What the fuck was today
Sell puts to you degenerates when tomorrow is red!
Now that tech is dead, any recommendation on a newspaper that prints shitposting on their articles?
Following Bill Gates into GWH since I didn't learn my lesson on CPNG

These calls are up though. Hoping to see $11.50 by open.
My accountant gonna be like ‚Äúyou realized lots of losses where are the gain? ‚Äú
Yay for buying 0DTE SPY calls at open today and selling right at the top before that freefall. Not buying shit tomorrow because I can't buy 0DTE's.
Bought a couple 10/20 $446 SPY calls seconds before market close. 

Let‚Äôs do this!
Just waiting for my SPY and QQQ 10/13 Iron Butterfly spreads to blow up
its been garbage since january. interesting timing
Bears guhed at open, bulls guhed at close
Bought more on a discount
Not even a 1m sell candle? Bullish
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
How bad tomorrow??
When is the crash coming
Um wtf?
Nice move retard
SDC haters fomoers out in full force today. I will get on them once it gets back up.

Spy great close . Grabbed calls on the cheap
Holy shit FB, glad I didn't buy these calls when they were $4,500. I'd be pissed.
Hey buddy markets closed don't need to drill more

Lose more money, duh
Christopher Columbus made me lose money üò†
We‚Äôve really been given every chance to get out of this market at this point. Sure we might get another 10-20% out of it, but there‚Äôs no question the foundation is faulty and it‚Äôll drop hard and fast

Are you the new me? I’m sorry. Sure you’re ridiculously good looking, but every play you make will be a week early for a bit ..
This guy speaks in CNBC
LETS GO NETFLIX.
How many bags do you hold?
SPY Puts
Puts at close? NOT ME.
whats going on is it pump time? before a dump
I just bought puts 1 minute before market close. is that okay?
Zillow is literally turning into CarMax but instead of cars it's houses. Holy shit
[deleted]
Pencils Down. Dicks out.

VisualMod can I have a kiss?
holy shit movie theaters are dead
NFLX 600 puts looking so juicy
S&amp;P ATH probably this week. What happens after that? Just keep bumping the ATH? Any of you nerds know how many ATH so far this year?
:(
Hate when work gets in the way of trading. Looks like some of you retards got rich today.
End of the day win: TSLA Puts started to print!
Theres always potential to make gains off of boomers
why the f is $TLRY up 15 % news of merger acquisition shorts just deciding to  cover 🤔 signed bag holder
Tilray 🚀
I’m just tryna pay for this new MacBook I bought 😂 SPLODE BB. YOU CAN DO IT
#i hope my guy still has his balls by the end of this week…🍇🚀🍇🚀🍇🚀🍇
Hope this Battle is the final one![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
So the SEC is blaming you retail traders for GME and calling it "gaming" so they are coming after you.  While you cheer for pfof bans, which provides all you small traders free trades they are actually trying to ban you from trading at all.  It's like when are you going to realize that nothing the SEC does is for your benefit.  They hate you.

squid game- game 1: hold Netflix thru earnings
Ok fine I'll buy Schwab leaps
👋
Sold my AMC $41p’s at open today because it looked like meme stocks were going to moon again. 🤡🔫
NFLX crashing the market
[deleted]
[deleted]
And Gondor will answer. Prepare for battle!
That is allot of bag holding.
You’re all doing great. I’m proud of you son.
TSLA FD’s for the cheap cheap before close.
Most options expire worthless with or without WSB. Something like 10% of options are exercised historically
[deleted]
Except for that one time it pumped like 15% lol
I officially hate elon
Very cool Elon, 🙏🏽
:/
Netflix is about to be fried calamari 🦑
can someone give me a loan i dont have to pay back
I work at an isp and Netflix traffic is up so their costs are up so they'll tank. But their views are up, so they'll moon. I don't really work at an isp. But you can make any news fit any narrative, especially if it's fake.
Let’s fucking gi
are nflx earnings going to influence the 🐭?
Pretty soon Zillow will be your landlord. Can't pay your rent? That's ok, Zillow will just throw you to the wolves.
Then buy options. TLRY 12.5 C 11/26 under $100

Could buy leaps on Schwabb (OR $100 C 1/21/22 is $30) but banks aren’t as volatile usually. You don’t have to YOLO 1 DTE options every day to be a degenerate.
TSLA trynna make sure I’m bankrupt before the market closes lol
BB 🚀🌕
_deploys cash with sad face_
[deleted]
I pray for my BBs.
There’s a massive inventory supply shortage. Home prices wont go down for several years at minimum. Always need housing for people. Our area were moving to is expected to increase in value by 7% next year. Our house will be worth 20k more in a year than what we bought it at today.
How are those balls feeling
We all just bought this morning and are up like 20% lol. Only boomers lost 70% today.
Lmfao ur poor af
Holding TSLA calls until worthless gang
lol, people never learn with this stock do they?
Nah
SPY is about to pump
Well you better do a screenshot then

Jeez us
It's a new ATH kind of week for all asset classes
TLRY after hrs going to be fun
[deleted]
What happened with tilray? Checked during lunch and was up 15% after being down this morning. Can’t seem to find any news.
$WISH December calls will be a 10 bagger
For the GAP fills.
The day I buy msft calls and it decides it won't have another $5 day
Haha nah it looked like a good deal so i bought in
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Netflix earnings preview: “but but look over here at squid game!”
Only 46% down on my TLRY shares now, nice
Same here but ex 1/21/22
Yeah, I don't want to exit anything to just literally gamble like that
You can take my shift at Wendy’s…..I’m back up 😎
Good luck guys. IV is too high, so imma sit this one out.
Hahaha me too!
This did not seem to work out well. It tried... but like most times.. RKT takeoff aborted. I cant wait for the one time it actually does again!
Sshbhh nonone say anything about WISH
I love Tesla but after this run up probably sideways then sell of ah
Vegetarian incel spotted
Netflix 680’s before close 🚀 
Squid games sending me to mars
Hold on to your nuts &amp; tits for Netflix earnings 

after hours gonna be a whole squid game
Reminder that when NFLX beat their estimates by 25% in Q1 it dipped by 10% the next day lol
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/z3x7** bet **BB** goes from **11.43** to **25.0** before **2021-11-09 15:56:18.545809-04:00**
SPY 1dte 235p are only .01 each right now guys get them while they’re cheap
FSLY doing damage today.  $60 soon.
Got tsla for next week should i yolo through er
Woo let's go nflx. Last minute yolo is the best way to spend money.
!banbet Bb 25 3w
See you tomorrow morning when TLRY hits $13 boys.
Honestly I'd take it, seems like it goes down big every earnings.
AMC announces new business. They're going to teach financial literacy in their theaters and critical thinking skills so as not to fall to conspiracy theory's. Also, non stop Jane Goodall because apes. 

Fucking idiots
Aye thanks man. Sold a bit early but oh well.
10/22 ex 345$C
My gut says NFLX puts, but my acct balance says STFU and sit this one out broke boi.
I hope that guy chops his nuts off
Mara is the bigger mining company, plus they hold onto everything mined. RIOT just sounds cool.
Yup. Still holding. Was down like 80% now it’s like 55%
RIOT bought for tomorrow
Tsk tsk
I read that a wise, high brow ape will keep pumping money into that depressed stock until it goes up and buys a lambo. Definitely not financial advice.
I'm sorta worried that a lot a sales are going to happen because of the sudden spike and some folks out there making money off of small changes. Who knows, maybe BB will hold out and surprise us.
Price targets are like assholes…
Goes in circles
uppies
Told the wife fuck that chicken she was planning to cook cause I'm grabbing some ribeyes on the way home tonight
They thought it was going to $5000 a share so $30 was cheap
Godspeed anyone playing earnings (either way, I suppose)
FB 350 sitting pretty with 11/19 expiration. 

I think I shant have me a beverage.
hello, im red
-70% bagholder confirmed
Netflix is priced in.

Get out while you can
I’m convinced wsb was setup by market makers to increase their profits off morons buying options that mostly expire worthless
1000 shares here. Average of 46 unfortunately. Been selling covered calls but just bought them back to cover for earnings.
Couple more days like this with BABA and I’ll break even on my leaps.
What’s hitting 30% ah and premarket tomorrow
After hours I smell a bloodbath
Netflix flat on earnings report
That's it I'm all in on BABA
I fear that NFLX getting wrecked on earnings is gonna ricochet shot my FB calls.
Yeah this is why I sold my spy calls and Tesla call.
[deleted]
AVIR OVERSOLD COULD RUN BACK UP TO 16S RANGE
But buying clov is clinically proven to make your dick smaller
I always end up doing the exact opposite of what the market is doing 😞

MARA and RIOT used to trade the same. Did MARA discover it's better than RIOT? Why is it up to $50 while RIOT is still $30?!

I picked the wrong one.
I really should not have paper handed those BABA LEAPS
BZ: Market On Close Imbalance: $100M To Sell Side
Netflix going one way or the other.
I just realized this is going to fuck us Amazon sellers over badly . Instead of getting $100 today they are going to pay us $25 over 4 months . FUCK
Netflix is gonna kill it, but iv gonna kill calls
Last 10 mins to casino close ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
AAPL 150C 10/22 LFG BOYS
Tesla uppies or downies tommorow?
They have 4 min before I sell
Thoughts on buying leaps with vix so low?
Good luck to anyone playing playing NFLX!
I’m such an addict, bought one $650 10/29 NFLX call just to feel the rush
Yeah I burned a day trade and got out. Lost a bit but whatever.
Penn vol pop at close
Still better returns and then most retards here, myself included
Puts on $JPM
Really interested to see the AH action.
It's coming. End of October usually brings a tidal wave
It gained 73 cents today lmao
Loaded up on more FB calls 

Duh and obviously
Same day as UPRO’s
r/boobs costs me nothing
Can't believe I bought UPST at the top
This was the pop, back down to $9 tomorrow, puts time.
Green rest of week. You’re good.
[deleted]
Boomer, r/stocks is over there
BB pushing into the close
Even VisualMod trolls 🌈🐻.
I'm scared for NFLX  and I aint even fuken with it.
Don't forget, tomorrow is a red day!
I feel like BB is going to take a quick breather after market to refuel before tomorrow. But then we'll fly.
I like surprises when i wake up to look at the market
Incoming 3 mil+ buy order on spy just watch
There's no risk on CLOV

Its a garbage company that was pump and dumped here. Smart money won't touch that shit to make the price go up anytime soon
Tesla and Netflix earnings are going to pull SPY down lmao
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Silent_Win116 (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 438.0 when it was 446.945 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Live dangerous
Wow NVDA flow is overwhelmingly bearish, some bigger bearish moves, am I missing something?
Get um
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Going cash gang won’t make your dick any bigger.
happens to all of us, don't dwell on it or else you'll blow your account up
Do you feel like maybe you’re not very good at your job since theese kids keep stalking and harassing me yet I’m the one who gets banned?
Or you can sell those shares and put the money into a stock that will actually go up
Last chance for NFLX yolos
TLRY below 12 - BUY


KERN below 3 - BUY


Barclays $11 - BUY (up 15% this month but banks will benefit when rates rise via the fed)


UBS $17 - more banking, should hit $20 and go up from there


Charles Schwab - love this bank, up 15% the last month but room to run. Should be trading above $100 IMO
TLRY, ZNGA, LCID get my 💰. LCID is literally the only chip dependent stock I will look into now bc it's new and undervalued and sells high end luxury items that depend on less units to make money. Their entry car I think will be like $80k USD.
My chase savings account just paid me $0.1 in interest. God bless
👋
We go up 🚀
If this market is letting me make money  .. ME .. nobody here should be red
CATHIE KEEP BUYING THAT UPST DIP 🥰

the year is 2132, all modes of transportation have been electric for a long time, early 2000s internal combustion cars are status symbols, the ultimate of which are 2013 honda civics
Still down 30% on my january purchase. Good luck to you and your bf
Okay tilray buddy lets finish the day strong 🚀💎
TLRY calls, NFLX calls. Pray for me gents
Thanks for reminding me I can sell exactly one single covered call on that lol. 2 dollars is 2 dollars. That stock has not treated people well
Anastasia ain't doing anything for my peen today
I think after hours will tell the story.  The volume has been huge this afternoon.  Something is coming
Wanna get Netflix puts. But I’m a pussy
TLRY to $20 AH let’s get after it WSB
$SEAT is a good stock
BABA has momentum but i have a weird feeling it might smack it's head on supply zone top, premiums seem low for OTMs, only put $250 on 11/5 150p but if she reverts itll still be pretty juicy
Not this time
If wsb didn’t exist those millennial only have x% of wealth of boomers at the same age would look a lot better for us lol
Only if you hate money
I like tradingview, haven’t really tried any others though
Playboy will be the market hedge for any downturn, once they launch centerfold, erybody gonna use it. They might as well also complete with Pornhub with free content. And stop fucking going all in on puts you degens.

I have bags...bags here for sale. $$$ lettering not included.
Tilray
Yes
You ever get tired of making so many comments on Reddit only to keep being ignored?
SPY put obvious play
10 minutes left to recover losses from the past 6 months? Can I pull it off? Tune in next week in Scooby Doo tales of the missing thirty grand.
And naked calls too much risk not worth it
My dad works at VIX. He said you guys are cool, don't buy any call today for SPY
TOS or trend view
I’ll hold these bags of shit all the way to zero. I’m not voluntarily selling for a big loss. Cost basis somewhere around $7, and continues to decrease.
Retard spotted
Fuck it one Netflix otm why not 💰💰
Lol that’s logical. A streaming service will boost the EV sector. GL with your calls bro. I bough FD puts. Hoping to beat IV CRUSH.
SPY be like: I'm a good boy smooth let me go slowly atop 450 wall and ... slap down go back and try again slow and steady
I did that a few days ago when TSLA was at 790 then the next day it was at 850 🤔
They got a dope patent for load balancing
And big green at that, was literally at 427 15 days ago
$HOOD looking good on the daily, weekly and monthly chart , up she goes from her
Should we?
What is it boysssssss
Spy calls or puts before this closes
Who’s buying?
I need a quick EOD buy
I bought a couple of NFLX puts for an earnings play, but I just chickened out and sold them. 🤡
puts or calls for netflix
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
I wouldn’t DARE buy puts though…. Got royally F’d on this rally. Bull forever now
26% for me fam 📈📉
Well i got 25,500 shares lol i might as well get paid to hold them at this point. Can easily make a few k a month selling calls above my cost average.
This place works in cycles. This september/october dip wiped out all the new blood yolo ape kiddies on here. That's why you're seeing "responsible investing" talk because those are the survivors  


Market is going to be green af into xmas. It will become a whole new all in yolo bull circle jerk again soon enough
The fact you think I’m a neck beard and have a instagram is funny. You want to see a picture to realize how big of a mistake your making. Sorry can’t help you

Will it?
Thank you so whoever bought the 255 CLOV $10 Calls 10/29 expy from me.

You can make a good living selling CC on this one while i wait. Earnings Nov 10 so i dont think it flys till then anyway.
Someone knows something with BB. This looks like it's going to have another short-lived pop. YOLO

Any idea why Fastly is flying?
COVID-19 strikes and out of nowhere Zoom and Webex own the show when options like Skype have been around forever. Much strange. Such intrigue.

CLOV for the downvotes

It has been an interesting day.  Still up 57% for the month.
I think netflix will have a big day, bought some calls. If they do we will have a massive green dildo tomorrow, then Tesla will have an even bigger day and Tesla will hit 1000.

Edit: what a shit stonk lmao propped up by people that have no idea what they do loool
in a month WSB will be super active again and a bunch of new accounts will be buying WISH at $10 and TLRY at $20. Get ahead of them
Spy gonna run up until close soon I think
ugh, my gf is up like 60% on that thing. crazy
Same question for me
Waiting for TLRY to surge after-hours
What was she planning on pegging you with

Tilray shorts must have some huge balls if they hold their position into afterhours.  We've seen this movie before!

Should I hold my SPY $450 calls until tomorrow?
Bought 1000 SDC because memes this morning as well as 200 in TLRY just to park some cash. After months of holding a shit ton of PLTR and selling CC's for breakeven basically (still holding) and losing on some Tesla spreads last week, this feels nice.

Holding FB calls till Friday, no reason why it can’t keep running up 🤞🤞🤞
It’s honestly prob the move
No clue what they do but pbr $11 10/29 has 77k volume
BB whats going
Why isn’t SNAP zooming with all the upgrades and news out today
Look at 10 year if you want a hint at what tomorrow will do…
Bag signal*
🤡
UPSTART!!!  you make 200m per quarter!!!  Surely you should be a 200b market cap company!
When is SPY's earning call?
This shit is so fucked, I would've legit accepted TSLA 850 EOM a week ago.  But now 850 feels like a crisis
Always risky, it's almost morning time, they have a full day to fuck your shit up before you can do a thing.
WSB pump
I've just got $100 to devote to this so I did a 11/12 1200 call. Just plan on holding it this week.
NFLX gonna drill AH
Not even 40m spy volume

Can we just get Tilray to 12 today? Wife promised me anal if it hits 12
Calls or puts?
fb just fucking pathetic
I feel like there are far too many people here lately advocating responsible long term investing strategies.    I get that you only came here because you're a boomer that heard about reddit on CNBC but fuck you anyway.

Is anybody in here jacked to the ⛰ tits 🏔 ?
Don't be such a pussy next time
the day was slow for most tickers after like 9:45, so the overmind decided to pump and dump the meme stonks.
Are you me? Hoping AH brings a 1% movement up or something. Literally greed on my end. I was up 100% today. Still sitting pretty on what I earned but sick to stomach again.

Edit: Holding 2 Oct 22 900c
&gt; I don't know what a bat signal is, but I think it's just a coincidence.
the new and improved Twitter Will Meade
Did not think the ape statue on Wall Street would have such a profound effect on the market today.
1) Bc it's currently well below value 2) MORE Act passed in US House and now dems have majority, so it will likely pass in the Senate. 💩 about to get 🦌 wild.

Look out, TLRY heading back to ATH
Schumer tweeted twice about marijuana legalization yesterday. Is that his bat signal that something will actually happen soon?
It always goes like this after a pullback. When the spy and qqq are done pumping the memes take off
Saw an article that said FCELs price target was $26, should I go balls deep?
Why you are still waiting? Get on the FB train.
I am actually fairly convinced this is the top of tech for a month or so, for other reasons I've found from following the charts. The news follows the charts. I have no idea why, but it does.
Who the fuck is Zack Morris?
Hold BABA calls overnight? Up 40% on these babies
Loading up on BABA puts. Pullback tomorrow.
Yea half my retirement is in weed too.  What is this portfolio you're talking about?  Mine's in my closet. Puff Puff
Just wait, I'm sure a mysterious trader known as Melon Husk or Wathie Cood will buy a couple mil of OTM Tesla FD calls this week to cause a gamma squeeze.

Have fun staying poor.
You miss out on the big jumps when they happen (been there too many times)
-60% YTD? Sounds like someone is on the fast track to WSB mod
Lol. Nerd.
#Outta tricks, markets circle the drain. This is the end, my only friend the endddddd.
The fuck. Bought $10k worth of COIN today at premarket for $302.78.  It's shit all day.  I sell at $302.05 and 15 minutes later it's at its daily high.
Ok boys who is placing their bets on Netflix
The human touch  🤗 

But wait until Elon’s Sex bots hit the market
I feel seen ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
i bought yesterday morning, was up a dec amount yesterday, was not expecting a day long dump. dw
This is what I needed, thanks
Oh that's boring...but not options compare to casino

Seeing a line go up or down WEEEEEEEE LOOK MUMMIE IM HAVING FUN!
$SDC looking sexy
I'm no bear. I just play both side
Time for some real life squid games, plenty of 🌈🐻 that would sign up.
We pumpin or we dumpin?
Truth👆
what’s a percentage?
Fair, i thought since it was still itm and movements like this are expected with memes that it was a realistic price. If i bamboozled myself then i lose 600. Oh whale🐳
WISH $6 ATH

I bought a small position in BRLT.  They sell lab grown gems and jewelry.  Suck it DeBeers.  Lab grown diamonds are cheaper and more optically pure than mined and the lab workers who make them are well paid.
Weak

Top Answer: *Down 60%*

We're not so different after all
look at that volume!
&gt; That's what I do.
Wish up 8% 🤝 me still down 48%
At what point does $BABA become a short again
What's going on with $WISH?
Nun gives dire prediction, evil is upon us, Market Crash, weeeeeeeee
What was SDC news
Why dont people find a good stock, buy more every pay Check and sell monthly cc for ever?
$SDC last push before AH
BAN this guy belongs in investing
Lol.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
I actually think this is the top of spy for the month, for unrelated reasons. good job!
if a stock is up 9% half of what it opened at is still too much
He’s figured us out! Run!
What a day
SPY opening 452 tomorrow just to crush puts
Me neither, but I'm quitting in 23 minutes for another job so idgaf sue me
half of you here bought TLRY at 30 LMAO
Apes trying to steal TLRY's growth. 📉
I sold at 47 and 45. Enjoy holding my bags
Well bye bye profits on spy lol stupid Tesla
What did you learn?
eh i know it’s a joke, was just hoping it would follow up on some stupid fomo trend. not an ape dw
You’re about to get cucked again if you paper-hand
$WISH is easily going to $10 in the next couple of weeks. Zack Morris has a PT of $69 and he's the one who pumped all the recent stocks over 100%. He made FCEL go up 25% yesterday just by saying he's "swinging it for a day." yeah it's fucking stupid but market is on stupid mode right now.
i’ve been gone for a month, need an options play what’s the moves
Me too.  Me too
I feel like some new bag holders are about to learn that exit pumps are a real thing.
35 is better than 85
HOOD LOOKIN JUICY ON THE 1 HOUR

Enjoy watching those expire worthless :) bears don't win.
RVVTF bucillamine study ending soon.
Fuck Merck.
Legit can’t focus at work watching spy
Should I say fuck it and buy TSLA shares?
Sold my TLRY Dec 12Cs, time to roll em into 20Cs 😎
I feel like if NFLX misses which I honestly kinda imagine they do, it ripples through the market like that one time amzn crashed us down.
California increasing its commitment to weed, the company's CEO said something, and a senator talking about introducing legalization in D.C.
He has calls. He's probably down 50% after buying at the top
'oh damn, its dumping' - me, forgetting about the vertical green line this week
Hoping to see it go up.
Dude I hope so. Like half my portfolio is in weed. Life changing money with legalization.
Bagholders should learn how percentages work 🤡🤡🤡
tfw u FOMO into meme stonks at the top of the day
Half this sub would rather lose money so they could joke/post about it then actually make money by buying leaps in non dogshit companies
Just went long on SPY, the top is in.
What was that with $wish
SNDL I know the goal is $1. But for some reason 4.20 has a sexy ring to it.
Shorting NFLX myself, search trends down over the last couple months and they usually miss earnings. Will see how this goes.
He needs to let go of his *anger*

It’s not the Jedi way n’am say’n
454c loaded up let’s hit all time high tomorrow plz
guys pleas take profit on BABA you don't know what ali baba and the 40 jinpings will do next
SDC is the move. How do I know? Because it’s the meme that didn’t meme yet. At least I’m not slamming a used meme
Netflix already up 20% since last ER, seems priced in. Especially for big tech companies who have run ups to their ERs . Position call credit spread
FB wants to die into EOD. Alright I guess, cucked by zuck once again 🥺
SDC shot up around 9:00am and has been steadily climbing since
BB don't you tap out now.
Smart money is throwing us a bone on a string
Really how can it be sold at $5? Super underrated
I did, half what it opened at😢 the low of the day .25 for oct 22nd 5.5 puts i swear i thought i wasnt being retarded
Why not both
that would be sweet - up
COIN and BITO are looking like solid long term plays!
Tomorrow would be spicy
imagine basing your earnings on one show
I’ve noticed as well
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

[deleted]
Where’d you read that at?
Love to fucking see it
Hold these 448p? Or sell at a 35% loss lol? Spy has too much retard strength rn
Would you rather make money or be able to make jokes about losing money
Tapering mid november! puts on QQQ! gbye!

Right? All I can say is that it's about goddamn time
Tired of these bag holder hyping themselves over a 10% run 🤡🤡🤡
not poor
I’ve a Amex platinum, does that mean anything?
SNDL finna breakout
Serves you right trying to get out early
Shorting NFLX, search trends down over the last couple months and they usually miss earnings. Will see how this goes.
You’re down 3% on a joke company meme stock. Be thankful it isn’t 30%
We had a down period for six weeks and now we are finally recovering and you people are still bearish? Look historically how the SPY has done in Oct and Nov. No reason to be bearish unless news comes out.
the game is to convince the plebs here to buy it mindlessly so it pumps up and then you rugpull them into years of bagholding
Spy why the fuck are you going back to 450
this is what WSB is all about. I love to make money with memes.
Why did tlry and bb both moon at 12:45 lol
🌽![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
The bag holders must breed amongst themselves.
look at the price youre paying lol
#Chub still on full 🍆 💦 this last 25 minutes will be insane price action for BB
But at least we made some friends :)

Sir, this is a Wendy's....go around the back
Start with a double wide on some land first
WISH never short the third largest ecommerce platform in the world. Fair value $26
Anyone know why TLRY and BB shot upwards at exactly the same time?? Any others stocks blast off at 13:00 today?
There are. Go to your closest Wendy's. Then walk behind the building to the dumpster and wait in the line.
CHPT chargepoint looking good too
I’m tempted to leave my BABA calls on the table even though I’m up over 100%
No one is buying my fucking SPY calls dammit
Think you are looking for r/investing
10s need to stop spooking spy
today many round eyes buy china stonk?
SDC smashed through the 5-20-50 Ma . Next test 100 ma 6.81
What in the BB did you guys do?!
Could be some room to run for a lot of those with bumps today (PSFE, TLRY, BB ones which I have anticipated recently).

I like the setups for DKNG and MVIS. Really cheap DKNG Feb 22 70Cs and MVIS leaps could pay off with low IV rn.
But can you scream it?
POS companies can be 10 baggers if you convince other idiots they aren't POS companies
the algos have chosen:

memes

and

weed
No. I sold for an 80% I dont trust this stock one bit lol
There’s nothing degenerate about that
TLRY TO $67
damn it how did I miss that
Why TLRY up?
Why its up?
Sdc can’t even stay up. Shit stink
This might be the dumbest thing I’ve read all day.
Holy shit I gonna coom. BABA is cruising. No resistance whatsoever.
Its my Birthday Today! I was told there were Blowjobs here
He loling at u
Glad I held onto my TLRY was considering eating the loss yesterday.
A steady and gradual decline of SPY.
You holding overnight?
Pugrull
 TLRY here we go again
BB don't fail me stay up there
I went with the 444 Puts 3 DTE
God damn bb
holy shit amc stop
I’ll never understand why wsb tends to focus on complete POS companies. Just buy legit companies and you will make money it isn’t hard…
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
It's not, check the 5 days chart
Right? Look at that volume. Wtf?
As much as I believe in BB, a +555% day trade was too good to pass up for now
$60
I’ll probably only give it until eod, though. Don’t know that I want to gamble it overnight.
I always wonder who are these new memetard pumpers every cycle when there are so many old bagholders. Where do they find these new rotations of retard bagholders? 🧐
Oh ok. Thanks for the tip shit head.
#Stick a fork in it
Tripled my position in TLRY today boys. This is not the opportunity to miss 🚀 🚀 🚀
Tilray raging through PH.  Can we get a 30% AH runner as will!   TLRY time
Buy wish puts at the top, wish go down, my put go down 15 percent. Like i know i.v. is a fickle bitch but cmonnnnnnn
Chargepoint time
TLRY AQUEEEEEZE!

Someone knows something we don’t about WISH. Big news after hours??
TLRY SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEZEEEEEP
Fuck Almost went balls deep on ROOT at 5 but my broker was giving me some BS warning about holding overnight
Just a casual 700% gain on BB calls. Let the new meme run begin!
Yeah, well did it wish you a happy cake day?  'Cause I did!  AI ain't got nothing on me.
Today has been awesome! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)
Another's reason we need a popular ticker thread. 

You have no friends here. It's every man for themselves
OTM weekly then
Lol yup. Win some lose some. It’s hard to say with this stock though, could turn around or it could fall off a cliff.
Good Bot
Lol! Truth!
Backing the truck up for more Tilray shares.  The time is now
Fuck no

Fair enough, fair enough
I’m a gambler
BB, TLRY, wish, clov, Root, sdc. All random huge spikes. Who’s blowing up haha
My guess is the day isn't over yet.
I was thinking that, but I think they are going to spin it with a squid game hail marry
Money is just ice cream that hasn't been purchased yet.

Money to be made.. even with dinosaurs
To be fair the dip was for the last 3 months on dump meme stocks.
No, just oversold with bullish divergence on the 1 day.

Y’all ready for the Sour Power Hour?
I'm hoping way higher.
Sigh…Sorry bro I’m getting hammered too got greedy

I did 👏🏼
Why is Riot such a POS ain't even keeping up with what makes it move. Smh.

Owhh sheet, nice man! ty
Of course TLRY waits until my calls expires then goes up
It’s been mooning?
I've had CNBC on all afternoon and no mention at all about the rise of over 14% for BB. This is news and this should be reported. It's almost like market manipulation on their part by not sharing what the stock is doing to not help give it steam.
Time for WISH to close that 9.30 gap 🚀🚀🚀
\+$4,700 on the day after a few days of getting smacked around. Needed that!
Moon
It hurts so bad

I just wanna be rich enough to afford an Italian villa on the coast. Is that too much to ask?
Still haven’t sold any $AAPL calls in my main account. Biding my time. Want a nice fat gain before I dump my stock position. I need the money for poker in Vegas. If things go well, my main will get resupplied with more buying power. Just need to get lucky.
How you gonna pay this month's?  Go to the Wendy's?

Here you go : https://investorplace.com/2021/10/bb-stock-looks-more-enticing-as-an-acquisition-as-its-patents-add-up/
Imagine going cash gang last week lmfao.
Imagine if a black swan event happens while everyone is risk on like right now with full on margin.
More like the annually TLRY week
Well I was sitting waiting WISHing

You believed in weekly options

Then maybe you’d see the gains
i shouldve listened to the guy who said Fsly earlier
Come on BB let's moon baby 🚀
Dummies should have bought the dip last week.
Spy can you stop doing this shit you always do please
[deleted]
Even SNDL is up that's how you know this rally is fake and 🌈
# Very Cool Very Legal 🙄
(Me, sweating, holding a bunch of DIS calls) uhh I hear they’re comin out with a new Mickey Mouse
net out of steam.

SDC is ripping this week. $1call up 15.56% since monday.
Probably not while waiting for Tesler earnings AH
Is this the quarterly BB power week?
Look at GME being the nice safe stable boomer stock now.
It's getting wobbly.
My BB avg cost is $14.86; all I need is for to get above that….
SO I CAN KEEP HOLDING 🦍
Getting higher and higher puff puff...and yea the weekies are up too.  They said they would be back for us and those wonderful retards are here.  Well done autist.

Now squuueeeeeeeze.
SPY is stagnating.
SPY to the basement.
Watch for travel stocks and $BA to rally.
JPow Bless America baby! 🚀🚀🚀🦅🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🦅🚀🚀🚀
Thanks to Spy, last month’s rent is paid ☺️
Thanks TLRY, unloaded my bags and took an 80% gain, coulda been more but I'm just happy to have nearly doubled my money. Good luck weed gang
whats people's opinions on BB after hours? Moon? Tank?
When After Hours hits..

*So does the BB*
Just sold some Citigroup calls for -25% couldn’t take the bleeding anymore 

Watch it fly now

Spy 453c 10/20
:(
weed stocks killing it today
WISH 100%
**BB Calles 10/200 $12**
I have successfully used SPY 10/27 450c’s to make back the money I lost on 10/22 448p’s this morning. Yin and yang
0DTE SPY calls  tomorrow?
There is something weird going on with all the meme stocks except AMC and GME.  Moon mission incoming???
So either: last dip of all time or last rally of all time. 😂
I think a small fund got liquidated. A certain popcorn ticker spiked at the same time the SPY dropped. The rest is just phomo.
Wtf is happening, everything is running all of the sudden?!
**BB Calles 10/200 $12**
Blew your load too quick huh?
SDC is up 10% and i'm still down 15%, these bags are too damn deep
source
SKLZ really wants to explode
Once I was staying at a Bed and Breakfast in Talkeetna Alaska. It was run by cultists and we had one large communal bedroom. Some bitch was a wealthy heli-skiier and she said she worked at SoFi. That is my DD. Buy SoFi.
Triple top on RKT 😐
Literally spy calls dude
or Nike :(
These violent squeeeezes have violent ends
🎸👽
What is going on, BB, WISH, PROG, SDC??
Why is TLRY running?
[deleted]
$SDC new high of day . Looking for moon to 7.50 after hours or am
Better than -$20
Tlry weeklies up 1,500% wtf
How’s Tesla and spy doing? I’m too scared to look but god I hope it’s going up. Please tendie lord
Renewables doing a thing today 🤑
I hope someone tailed the play….
cant you see? This is the meme stock run before the holy -gme- meme run
This is nuts ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276) everywhere
now this is a power hours, fuk ya poots
Apparently I’m the only one who has SOFI weeklies
Haha it's nice to be actually making money for once
Every stock is up , if you are holding some deep red stocks you might want to pick better stocks.
Yeah I know. RIP
so you made penny a burger?
Just let it flow
All stocks are meme stocks.
Just woke up, why is BB running?
Volume on FCEL is 1/3 of total float
👽💋👽
Don’t pick up new bags.
What do you have it at? I have a strike of $890
SPY looking real cheap right about now
Let me start by saying yes I make fun of WISH, yes I think everyone flooding in at 10+ was stupid as hell. But after seeing what happened to my BB and what happened with TLRY. I bought some WISH calls at the start of the spike because it’s pretty fucking clear it’s time to not let your memes be dreams. Now wether it makes me money or not I’m still gonna continue to make jokes about those those who baghold shares at 10+ but as for now let’s go WISH make me that money!
Why the hell not? Earnings look good so far, and the big tech companies and their chad profit margins are coming up next week.
california had some bill in the news and tlry named a new management addition. Glad to see it spiking but I'm selling calls against my shares to lock in profit.
Hell nah bull rally just starting 🤑
For real though, what causes this? No catalyst, no news, no nothing, then.....moon for no reason. This really is a fucking casino lol.
SPY is within striking distance of a new ATH. Could happen this week if earnings remain strong.
$WISH could easily be just under $10 before earnings again. Which is like a 100% move lmaooooo. $WISH has the most potential out of all
Hey good win, mate.  Congrats.
Lol
&gt; I made 10,000 burgers today.
we probably wont experience another red day ever again, at least not in our lifetimes
what is the yolo for tomorrow????
Go back and look at all the comments you have about me and pay close attention to the zero interactions you get because just like you get ignored &amp; disregarded in your real life same shit applies on the internet. Only a internet thug tells someone to meet them and then isn’t there when they say they will be. Stop stalking me or I’ll get you banned for stalking and harassing. Hit me in my messages and I’ll give you my number and we can talk.
BB to $20. BB is an amazing company with GOOGLE!
460 tomorrow tbh
SoFi 👸🏻 boys 

We here for the loonnnngggg run!
Ahahahaha. How many burgers you made today, btw?
Omg you guys are legit morons
I think your bags will get a little lighter soon
Dude it’s following two straight weeks of red. And everything still hasn’t recovered.
[deleted]
I know we are retarded but the lobotomites that split off from here and ordered physical shares of their meme stocks are a special kind of retarded
GO TILRAY!! Fly baby fly
This but unironically
#To all my BBelievers out there - a MASSIVE thank you. Today was life-changing for me. Love you all so much. ❤️😘🥰😍
Agree, or could hold the same to be fair
Then I saw the stonk, now I'm a BBeliever

Not a trace, of BBags in my minds

I'm in love, I'm a BBeliever

I couldn't sell BB if I tried
SDC and WISH made a good day great
$WISH AMAZON BUY OUT AH NEWS
I sold all my wish calls. I should have yolo'd my entire savings on calls expiring friday. god i hate myself
Netflix lotto tickets acquired. It would be funny if it rips this time.
Holy shit spy thanks for the 200$
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
What is happening. Someone blowed up bigly ?
Has there ever been the opposite of a market crash? Where everything just goes up like 40% in a single day?
Excellent. Up $5700 today so far
The harder I get.
You said you made 120k earlier? From 120K he now at 82K burger boi. I make a double of what you make right now before bonuses and RSU. Plus, I am interviewing for a job that will be triple of what you make and I don't even have to go to office or mop a floor. Idiot, quit raging at folks on this sub.
The market can stay irrational longer.. ya know the drill
Man, I hope everyone is taking profits
[deleted]
if we all buy wish we'll all benefit, we can't be divided
Same brother I feel like a bitch
Market has been lame as fuck for months. I’m sorry I doubted you my sweet memes
WISH time!  Get in now
I think we might blow through 451
you dumb fucking bears!!!!!
COIN bullish close
Real fuckin good
don't be a bitch buy into it
Blackberry!!
WISH with the out of control green dildo
I miss something on WISH?
MMs decided it was time to genocide the 🌈🐻
Its happening
Hold these NFLX put FDs and pray my way through this earnings call🙏 ?
Vegas must have raked it in last night. And survivor pools destroyed.
how we doing today wsb
Options settle T+1 so I would assume only a day, but I'm not 100% sure since I don't have a cash account
$WISH &amp; $BB LFGGGG THE MEMES ARE BACK!!!!
TLRY’d into fomo, we are definitely gonna see $12 soon though not worried
[deleted]
bers

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Spy squeezing !11!!1!
So everything is just mooning? What happend to the last time when it was meme stocks mooning and spy drilling and vice versa?
This is a totally sustainable 5 day rally.
Anybody else play desktop metals?
Hedge funds liquidating their smaller short positions to pay for gme shorts. This is the beginning of the end.
It’s finger lickin good!
You fuck bitches? So you cheat on your wife and kids?
SPY do go up tho
I panic sold my calls early for a big loss. FML
Nice
Well looks like all the people that Wished are getting their bags pumped too
Selling a winner too early hurts more than holding a loser too long
Naked Selling, Leverage, margin, and box spreads would like a word with you.
[deleted]
Damn lol
Have you considered gambling on FDA approvals. Super high moves on those and somewhat predictable
I'm so erect
I'm the guy who sold covered calls yesterday for 11/19. And I'm losing my butt.
Holy shit keep slapping that ask on WISH and TLRY
$HOOD is going to be play of the week !!$$
Up 2.3k on my Jan 21 2022 15$ bb, holding 2 🌙
The simultaneous pump of every meme can only mean bad things
One of those days where all of your retarded plays combined nets you $20.
Fairly certain BB will crash back down below 11 tomorrow. Or it will rip. I don't fucking know
NFLX 8% implied move
its going up fast
TLRY is the king of dumping
Big dum dum 

Who is selling before IVY and the patent sale
why would u do such a thing
I sold 16 and 19 TLRY Nov19 CCs today earlier before the big spike..first I was angry watching the premiums skyrocket..and now im worried about assignement..
That was on the way down calls now it’s on the way up
GUH…the fomo is real right now. Must stay strong.
Bro worst case scenario by tomorrow you lose like 10% if you buy now. More upside than down tbh.
You get a meme stock, and you get a meme stock!
#Ban Bet Won

/u/Puzzleheaded_Way_582 (1/0) made a bet that SDC would go to 6.12 when it was 5.56 and it did, congrats gigabrain.
[deleted]
&gt; I'm not interested in clovs chart today.
$clov finally broke the resistance line.
Wait sundial is making money now too?
I Have 22000 shares of BB but still fomo looking at those 11x weekly
BB are you with me.  Are you riding?
Close at 451 so we see 460 on Friday
OPAD y’all!
[deleted]
Wouldn’t be surprised if spy opens already breaking ATH and hit $460 in 1 hour. Watch Biden come out w some news. I’d cum
Why do I feel like we’re in for another January/April soon?
Why cants Nokia get the same treatment as SOFI?
You got the wrong person burger boi 

BTW, what's the special at Burger King today?
Like peas and carrots
Fed's Waller wants tapering to start in mid-November.
[deleted]
I’m long on BB. First got in at the start of the year, but rather than sell for decent profits I averaged up during the spike to 20. Now if it goes over 15 in a short period of time yeah I’ll probably set a stop loss this go round. But I do think it’s a long term value play. Not opposed to taking profits though.
Up on my BABA calls. Going to hang onto these puppies for a few more days to take in the cash
If only I could have known about that TLRY move I'd be rich
I bought ROKU calls in case NFLX beats
[deleted]
&gt; You're poor.
Just like all your comments this when will get ignored as well. I don’t flip burgers you still birth I make $82,000 a year plus bonus and I fuck bitches. You could never relate. Just like you didn’t answer your door when I said I was going to chop it up with you after I drove almost 50 minutes. We are not the same.
BB POWER HOUR 🚀
24$ FD's all day baby
BB don't be a bitch, reach for $12!!!!!
Banned for a week. : ) i can't wait till we have less screeching about sdc
Hell yea. Holding until $100
I bought 100 shares in $WISH on Friday as a little gamble, WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY?
Moon Bananas!!!🚀😎 TLRY
Options pricing models don't correctly account for trend.
I hope so, because on this end it seems the dip keeps dipping
10 year bond now at 1.641... Holy balls... Is it really going to go above 2% before end of year?  What happens when they start tapering?  What happens when Evergrade officially defaults on offshore bonds on the 23rd?  Jesus this is getting exciting... So glad I cashed out.   You tards are fun to watch.
Go ahead SpY look at youuuu ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
Where’s the guy that sold all his bb this morning? Lol
Yea thb gonna do this
Hey SPY you wanna come the fuck down u fuk
The moment I had SDC in my portfolio I knew I lost
So many rockets!
Yo
Oh no no no.
Need more.  We were here last week then it retreated.  My price point is 15
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I am a little worried about Evergrande defaulting this weekend though
Now THIS is podracing!
i bought in wish, its been going up for me
Oof more nflx puts or no?
Meh, there’s no consequent if I do
Is there an emoji for an upside down dead bear
I am!

And the next night right thru earnings
Relax guys, BB’s still a long hold. We all know its real value is in the triple digits.
Jan 21 2022 15$ exp
Glad I got into WISH and BBBY half an hour ago, calls printing like crazy!
TLRY is Mooning !
Hold til zero
[deleted]
have you watched american gods? The memes are not dead unless they lose all followers. They might turn weak, but dead, no.
Why yu say that sir
Long shot won last night and it is evident a lot of problem gamblers have excess cash today.
12/7 380
Retard season is back boys
Why is tilray pumping
ya I tried that with TLRY. Didn't work. Market is in stupid mode right now and when market is in stupid mode shit like AMC goes to $80
depends on exp, but yeah sell a little
BB. Breaking that $11.63 wall
EXP?  

if weeklies, probably.
I figure it will pump today and tomorrow it will fade around 11am EST. But I don’t know a thing.
JESUS FUCK. Everything is moving so fast. I only have one browser window open!
[deleted]
Everyone buying Wish, you already know you will lose your money by tomorrow morning. Stop being apes and buy BB or TLRY (which actually have a chance at making you money) 🚀 🚀 🚀
I hope you fail
Take profits when you want to
BABA for the win.
$HOOD ready for lift off , get in

Meme train is boarding
I don't even know what the rest of the market is doing today, who cares?
Agreed, a few shitty stocks go up 10-15% after weeks of mostly red and all the idiot bag holders feel the need to spam bullshit about it. 

I hope all your trash meme stocks go to 0 fuckwads
Very gay. Good job!
So new ATH EOW?
Damn why have I never seen this. Does it still take 3-5 days to settle like they say, because if it does I’d rather go with TDA where you only have to wait a day for options
Jan 21 2022 15$
mmmmmm WISH PUTS
Deja fuckin vu…it’s Groundhog day with all these tickers rising from the dead
[deleted]
Up 2k on my BB calls do I sell boys
BBBY memes doesn’t work
I’d sell and rebuy, theta is gonna be fucky
Wtf is going on with wish????
Easily see $18 this week lol
Which one of ya’ll bitches is licking my wiener?
\- The Architect
Get off my dick you fucking stalker.
Guy buying wish 5.5 last week was a week early.
short interest is 900% because reasons just trust me
u/DIET-BEPIS u/magnum_dong_opus and I are trying to help u/Usedillusion7. He is so tired of flipping burgers and getting shit from his customers, he comes to reddit to vent, which of course is not a healthy thing to do. He has grand illusion of things and believes he is the one who invented shorting the market. Be tender with him.
Some of the small memes are memeing and a golden monkey statue in the same week, it feels bearish to me
&gt; lol
WISH to the moon! For some 10/22 calls at .42! Let’s see how this bad boy opens tomorrow morning.
you of all ppl should know that only WEN makes those right?
$SDC going to $7 don’t count my words out
Lmao
BB Gang! Come out stand up!🚀🚀💯💯💯🤪
What’s happening with WISH? Large volume and spike up
Hold calls for tomorrow Orr sell and get a better price?
Our sacrificial lamb “ cashflow “is still holding puts so you should be okay
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/FreakySaiyan** bet **SDC** goes from **6.14** to **9.0** before **2021-11-18 15:14:07.038068-04:00**
$clov let’s do this
Hope you’re right
Tried to tell y’all all week to load up on memes
Any news on WISH?
Just a reminder.  You live in a simulation and the stock market is just an experiment within the simulation to see how much you can lose before you finally stop.
!banbet SDC 9 30d
True I been averaging more each week
Made $SDC posts past few days and people downvoted, $SDC posts today and I’m getting upvoted, either y’all SDC guys hiding, or the haters are dumbfounded 🚀🚀🚀🚀
QQQ recovering to HOD and FB completely stuck. About to spike my phone.
$wish and $clov to moon
The higher we climb....
I want to hear some of your guys' autistic earnings plays for tomorrow
WISH sweeps all up the option chains
Yeah, people reminded they need to get back in before that shit get legalized nation wide and 🚀
I'd happily take that record lol
Imagine buying SoFi calls today 🤦‍♂️
Just like that meme Stonks are BACK BABY!! **WISH GANG** GANG 🔥🔥🦍🦍🦍🦍🔥🔥
TSLA boys, we’ll be back tomorrow
we never left ...
[deleted]
Trust me you can lose a lot more than 100% if you try hard enough
Wtf is happening? So many rockets 🚀 🚀 🚀
are SPY calls b4 close a wise move? we green tmrw?
Goddamn $CLOV is hurtin for a squirtin! 👀🚀🚀🚀☘️🍀☘️
No Patrick a stock tanking for months and having a dead cat bounce at the end does not count as a "squeeze"
Paper handed UPST puts earlier today, I just hate money
CLOV fucking confuses me
WISH. That is all.
Just bought some more shares of MSFT #RoadTo100MSFT
We holding are Tesla calls overnight?
BB and TLRY literally mirroring each other lol
I been buying down here at the bottom 🤌🏻🚀🚀🚀
Get off my dick. Your obsession with me is cute but do you ever get tired of commenting about me only to never get any interactions. You must have figured it wasn’t enough to get ignored in your real life you also had to come to Reddit for seconds.
This place sucks dicks today
this is going to end poorly.
Same spot where TLRY took off from when it went to 70 🧐
jokes on you, I could do that at the office too (mostly because only the first hour and a half of the market are office hours)
CRSR gang = Value Gang
the same people will buy, who flamed me the last couple of months. I am sure FOMO will hit those MOFOs hard tomorrow. Also, waiting for the European market.
No, just have some SPY calls expiring tomorrow. Guess I should sell them.
ROOT run has begun
There is almost zero risk to pumping in this market. Literally every random green dildo candle is followed by endless buying. There really is so much fucking cash and super low attention span in the market rn.
Yeah for sure unless it tanks 10% lol
Sounds a little high
$WISH - are shorts covering so soon?
Fuck was that spy.
WE PREZIDENT NOW
The mirroring price action to TLRY is sus
Hope y’all averaged down on WISH. If it gets back to a measly $7.50 that’s massive gains.
Why do some of the comments that make ban bets get removed by mod and others don’t? I often see comments with VM under them confirming a bet is made but the original comment was removed. Are they making a ban bet and breaking some other rule or is it something about certain ban bets or what
BABA still only has a PE of around 20 when usually it trades at a PE over 50. It's earnings are also expected to double in the next few years. Double your money then double it again.
I swear if my puts for January 2023 on NKLA get hosed because they win a no contest judgement from Tesla
Imagine betting against Chinese Amazon. Never me.  
No way BABA gets taken down, because if the King dies aint no one throwing any more money into Chinese companies.
wish gang gang
LOL
1/21/22 baba 280c  30x

If TLRY can get to $12, $12.50 could be 5 minutes later.
890 Tesla calls expiring EOW. Hold for earnings?
Sell asap u ape wtf.  990???
I edited my comment to include the link
Volume is so low across the market wtf
Averaged down on my TLRY position for the first time in months at market open today. 

The weed gods have smiled brightly upon me today. Still down like 20% though 😂
I hope the people that bought the QS calls I wanted to but didn’t buy are doing well
ICLN bagholder here. Don't be like me.
Baby back ayy couple racks ayy
Wtf. Not only root but also wish and clov. TLRY and bb earlier. What is happening
Pushhhhh!!!!!
set up a trailing-stop order and wait for it to go to the moon, but no financial advise, just hope to see $BB around $40 EOW
TLRY next spike incoming
lol at this raging clown burger boi
We are literally about to hit ATH lol
✅Free markets!🧐😂
Can't wait for all the meme stock DDs now that they're running. Conveniently never before they run.
Lose money every quarter here: broke

Lose money every quarter but have billionaire friends: $10b valuation
Have you considered picking tickers based on how much money they make?
Yep
It was like $140 for a week not so long ago.
JUST MADE 100% ON CLOV CALLS LOL
My portfolio loves these BABA +6% days
CLOV pop🤞🤞✌️
How lol, I’ve never seen the option to switch anywhere
&gt; fuck off, I'm busy
got my money back on these sdc calls and got the fuck. out. too meme-ey for me.
[deleted]
Okay pretty sure Softbank just found out what WSB was and is buying WSB stocks at 75% discount
If that happens it’s 40 tomorrow
[deleted]
This is about to be me if SDC keeps going up before Friday. It’s what I deserve
You're in the wrong Reddit, wsb bears bought puts at $150.
Are we holding Netflix calls for earnings?
working from home is a blessing. you get to see your account lose money in real time!
Green porfolio WTF 😱😱😱😱
Meant 890
Dip bought
Yo I’m the same with BB calls. Are you thinking to hold?
Never thought I'd say this but WISH trying to Moon! lololzzz
890 I meant
Welcome to the longterm Investors Clubemote:t5\_2th52:4271
So much green I'm scared
What’s up with the price action mirroring exactly each other?!
WISH sound the fucking alarms here come the robots
11.63 is lava for BB
Hold
TLRY gang how yall doing? I'm up 80% on my calls that were down 90% today
I took 4 years of this stuff in college….I’m drinking beer tonight and watching the Astros win ….maybe lose…..probably lose
Bilbo Baggins
Root, TLRY and bb. What are those random spikes.
$ICLN, not really a meme, but a good bet
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/ResponsibleCut720** bet **SPY** goes from **449.99** to **360.0** before **2021-10-31 15:08:52.789171-04:00**
Just got massive returns on BB from a call. Do you guys think it’ll keep going up?
Those $BABA 3/18/22 300c I bought when they were .93 a call don’t seem like as dumb a play as I was beginning to think they were. Dumb, but I might still turn a profit at this rate.
Go G0 Goe! TLRY!!! 🪴🪴🪴🚀🚀🚀
BABA 300 EOY
convert it to a spread if youb wanna take some profits. no pdt and less risk.
Yolo’d all my Wendy’s money into $CRSP someone said they make crispy tendies
Tilray is a real company with real upside.
u/THCBBB he's back again
wow i’m really bad at picking memes. are amc and gme officially dead as meme stocks?
From the look of it. 

Could be the last dip of all time. 😂
BB from January not sell
Well don't just stand there, get me a fucking kleenex
If you travel in other countries in Asia and even parts of Africa, it's expansion and use is pervasive.
I already own 300 shares! I want more now that I have more cash.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I snagged a few lol
Ah. Thx
Jesus BB and TLRY really are fucking launching. Got paid on my BB calls last week, but having some this week woulda been fucking nice. Can’t complain shares almost even.
Lol yes you can

TLRY going HARRRRD
$WISH and $BABA pog
$BB today is like Tyson Fury in his latest boxing matches.
I'll tank the last 3rd of my whiskey bottle in celebration if we do.
I imagine a lot of them, like me, started buying calls after SPY broke the downtrend on Thursday/Friday last week
WSB... Get trashed, trade account, black out, check screen tomorrow for surprise.
I need to take a break from this sub anyway
Man I just want WISH and CLOV to go up so I can get out.
Sell it
They are probably out on their yachts today given they've been making bank for the past year straight!
where were you in september lmao
if TSLA gives me a 10 bagger this week I'm buying a Harley.
Da fuck is that WISH candle, will bagholding this piece of shit actually pay?
Fuck no

Wait even WISH is going up, okay someone is fucking with us.
Who is in COIN? What are your price targets?
TLRY break 12 today and to the moon
🅱️🅱️OoooYahhhh!!
Bought at the top, huh?
Once we cross $12, we're not stopping 🚀. TLRY 📈
Jesus BABA, I keep waiting for a dip to buy more but it won't stop.
Agreed. Needs it desperately.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
It really does!
Hold
Big Bang, Busty Bitchez, Baby Baby, BB Boom
I literally called $WISH next when my TLRY puts failed an hour ago. At least I made three times as much from WISH sold 2/3
$SDC about time 7 7.50 calls printing
dont get me wrong im happy cause ive got calls, but like.... y tho?
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/very-social-autist** bet **SDC** goes from **6.05** to **7.0** before **2021-10-29 15:05:24.148966-04:00**

Holy shit the puts vs. Calls for tomorrow is insane ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Can TLRY just go to $25 and get this climb over with.
Jesus christ, these 47 456C will be ITM tomorrow. Spy is full retard strength rn

10/20 373 Qqq poots? Only .50
What if Jack Ma was Prez?
Yoooo! Bullish call flow coming in and **WISH** with the pop!! 🔥🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
No one worried about 10yr?  Did they force us to focus on it only to make us numb to it?
Lol that ship sailed bro. And it ain't coming back.
Yes 👍🏻
The bull euphoria is palpable.
Good bot. Treat +1 for you
If you got luck on BB and TLRY calls today would you hold overnight or take the pdt hit and get out?
Not to the $27.50 bagholders
Damn TLRY looks beautiful
Sure, but you can't beat these new trading algos... They literally built dark pools to beat the markets consensus on options.
\*Narator:  
*It was never WISH's turn*
Looks like WISH is next. Jeez. I hope we can have a great rally with these memes.
TSLA is goin back up right guys?
Ughhhh idk if I should sell my 10/25 454c . Daddy I’m scared!!
went full retard and all in TLRY 10DTE calls. im such a degen gambler
TLRY and BB still flying! Even WISH just got a rocket 😯
&gt; no
BB putsz
🪦
i bot spy calls.
I think it’s a safe bet long term and seems to be one of the big players. It’s market cap is fairly high still so it’s hard to say just how much it can grow. I definitely don’t think it’s seen it’s highest highs. (Puns)
But there are some with market caps under 10 mil that could have biblical gains just getting back to where they were last February.
It felt like it was going to briefly but now we’re back to regular scheduled programming of ber r fuk

Not likely. Probsbly $800 end if week.
Down 27%
BB PLEASE I CAN ONLY GET SO ERECT!  
FUCK!
Blackberry bossing it. You love to see it.
Every bad trade or bad position can be explained with a conspiracy theory. It's never your fault.
That was quite the swing in the portfolio.
I've been bamboozled, hoodwinked, and led astray by spy. What are these fake pumps. Please bring sour hour or I'll have to pick up extra shifts
Got some Leaps Friday but didn't expect them to print already 😂

Surprised every single stock with earnings this week is getting sold off and nailed down
That's cold....just cold.....prisoners dont even treat each other like that
The options volume on FCEL is insane
Gotta love seeing BABA rallying only after I finally capitulate after holding for a year

that happened within 15 cents to me on GME during its second run. Changed my life in the worst way. Fucking elitist stop loss vultures. It was a trailing % stop loss two. most unlucky bullshit of my life.
SOFI rapidly approaching $20 again.... Need a stiff bounce back lol
Not nice why you were in BB at $20
I don't gamble on earnings at all, that bet could've went either way but good for you it worked out. I'm at no risk here so Mines well go for it
#BB gonna keep it going tomorrow? 👀 🚀 🍇
Sofi, you stupid fuk
Anyone with level 2 able to say what the sell wall at 21 for sofi is like?
Perhaps, but it’s up to a MOD to make that decision!
Imagine buying TSLA puts the week it passes 1000
BB gang deserves this
if you buy a stock for $10, hold it for a year and the company increases sales, production and innovation, allowing you to sell for $20, who lost to feed that transaction?  Nobody.  where did your $10 in profit come from?  Some of it isn't real, created by inflated currency.  But some of it represents the growth of the economy and is value created by work.  Not a zero sum game.
CNBC dropped story and there was 1m sell volume in next 10 min. It didt just “run out of steam”
Just buy more calls and let the market fondle your balls.
They got a contract to secure supply chain...something like that.
Perhaps because it is irrelevant
Let’s get all these apes out of here - permaban!
Tilray gonna keep pumping tomorrow, just getting started🚀
About 3 days
Saddest fucking comment I've ever read, jfc dude
NFLX trying hard to shake me off ha! DH babyyyy 💎
SDC has nowhere to go but up
Sold some covered calls against my BB shares this morning that are up 1000% now, so that’s fucking awesome
Every time in this bull run where multiple gaps up/down have happened in rapid succession, they eventually get filled.  The only instance that hasn't (yet) was the breakout over 400 back in early April, and even that got partially filled.

To expect SPY to keep going straight up from here is betting against a ton of history.
I turned 5K into 25K on their January earnings. Bought 5 dollar OTM calls for 1K a piece they were 5K when i sold. Got up to 7K a piece that day.
Please mods, bring back the popular ticker thread

Long run? That’s around 24 hours, right?
BB🍇🍓🚀 BBEEN HOLDING MY BAG SINCE EARLY SUMMER 🦍
Hoping it continues. I think it will since people will see a 15% day and since BB price is still low many will jump on.

The dumps are always real in the stuff I watch
Nice man. 3,500 shares here. 92 15Cs 10/22
Feels real nice but this isn't the move we're waiting on. We need $30+
I think a lot of investors realize this is overvalued and they will be selling into the close. Good luck everyone!!
Let's see 455 tomorrow
Pls. I just opened puts.
I just bought, it's so undervalued, looks like the govt is easing up
Mods
Patents, among other things.
Yes it will keep pumping into earnings
Lower highs
the fundamentals didnt change. its an ez play. anything sub-200 is a discount
Sadly I’ve never been able to withdraw money from my brokerage account before😭. I’m thinking about withdrawing $140 from my TDA account so I can see this masseuse tomorrow. If I set the withdrawal right now, will the money be in my bank account tomorrow?

It's trading at 530 of its profit to earnings. When people don't even know what the stock is, then yeah, it's time to short or long puts.
It’s going pretty well I had to refinance my home a few times but we’ll be alright
!remindme 12hours
Perhaps NKLA should stick to what it knows, concrete driveways
SDC MOONING![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)
I heard about that too but I called Robinhood about 2 weeks just to inquire - they said they can still remove it once.  Maybe the person I spoke to didn’t know what they were talking about.
sdc 10 eow
Nows the part where it goes to ATH, idk why 40 cents makes the ber com
MRNA bending me over and fucking me
Must be nice to be in Tlry or BB

No idea, fuck I should’ve bought that LEAP I was thinking about
gap down hard tomorrow, followed by a little V action, that would turn me on
nah, im still down 60% with a CC that's now down 168%
Dumped AAL at a bit of a loss but looks like its going into a massive slump
Well, still in on BB (bagholder here) but averaging at 17$... still a way ahead unil that turns green
Because I’m a straight white male. I can’t lose. The market will save me.
Wait, how tf did I win that 😂
You belong here brother
Wow that dip was the biggest joke. Watch us open 454
SPY 450 You can break this barrier

What are the chances of BB sustaining this rally into tomorrow? (Asking for a bag holder friend)
wtf is going with BB
$SDC SMALL DICK GANG but our ducks hung today $7 by Friday
Not talking about the percentage.

I bought a single NFLX call this morning for around $300 if they tank that's all I lose, if they completely destroy earnings I can potentially double that bet or even more. I think it's an obvious choice
How the fuck are a lot of these companies still around
Update: my portfolio up 58% for the day.
That's it BB, gonna need you to pump 83% more for me to breakeven.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)No stock left behind

Alibaba isn’t stopping for anybody you clowns!!!

LEssss goo BB? hit that 20 for daddy

Thought I'd got into BB late at 11 but it's at 11.40 now
Might wanna check again
That’s is definitely possible! Tesla is growing and expanding like crazy. People who think the train has already passed will look back 10 years from now when the stock is about the hit 900$ again (after it’s 10:1 split) and wish they bought

TILRAY.  ISN’T.  STOPPING. 😳🤯
Cramer pumps it tonight. It opens at 15 tomorrow
Not completely sure but

IVY beta is due out around the end of this month

Patent sale due to be completed by end of this quarter 

Some more deals, patents, and government contracts announced this month. 

Not sure if that’s why or if it’s just pumping for no reason. I believe BB is undervalued so who knows when it could go off.
Just check my bb and tlry stocks. Finally out of red.
11.50 will be good
I've quoted three lines today. This being the third.
Um. You might have a bit of a wait ahead of you. Why the hell are you bagholding a 60% loss???

Yeah, it could still continue its run for sure. It tends to have one of these crap days after a strong day, and almost always fades into close.
Wait I need 75% more
Yup sure have.

Any thoughts on CGC?

Hey guys Lcid is a great buy rn! They only have a little competition. You know Tesla, Ford, nio, vw, Audi, riv, gm… not much competition and they have a lot of room to grow even though they’re at a 40b mkt cap already 🥴🤡
We buying calls or puts on SPY for tomorrow?
Except fsly can’t compete worth a fuck because their business sector is too competitive

Fastly has a dogshit product and there’s a good reason customers are staying away from it instead of re upping contracts
VXX puts are printing harder than SPY calls right now just an FYI
BB going to $25..just read a TED talk on reddit
Idk but FUCK YOU😉
If I were a girl I would definitely get my tits done

Netflix really do be going green right now. The fuck
That’s yahoo notification for $ baba 🚀🚀

Absolutely. I didn't get in either. Wish I would have. Hoping we'll see some action when it wraps up.
NKLA lawsuit w/ TSLA day before earnings is PEAK lunacy

AMD never fails to disappoint. I’m just glad I only picked up one December call when it hit 115 instead of more like I wanted to.
TLRY has traded 10 million more shares than SPY today.
I just theta farm the shut outta it and hold my shares long term
Hold till end of sell tomorrow then we’ll and buy back in next Monday. Or don’t do anything
Will u b my BB
Fundamentals is why it’s going up retard. 

Where the fuck do you think trillions in excess cash that we just printed was gonna be used for?

Alright time for BB

Of course BB moons the week after my calls expire... 🙄 At least I have these 🌈 shares I guess.
Haven’t hit Tesla up for options in months. Finally do and it starts to flop right away.
Sell Tesla calls or…?
Meanwhile the 10 year is quietly up to 1.63%…
$SDC IS ROCKETING ITS STILL EARLY BUT ITS CLOSE TO $6 and the calls are cheap 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Yolod into TLRY this morning. Tripled my portfolio. 

Sold and bought puts bc I wanted to ride the correction also. It kept going up and now I'm back to even. 

Yay retardism!
That does qualify by the rule of the law as "balls deep". GL!

I am unable to watch the announcement... hope its good for us!!
Do I hold these 12.5c on bb or is it gonna dump ah or tomorrow?
If you missed the ship on NET don’t miss the one on FSLY. Balance sheet and everything is almost the same but one is 5b MC while the other is somehow 60b

Gosh darn it. Should have FOMO'ed into tilray when it was at 10.50
Look at the 1 week spy chart before you sell calls
AAPL hit 149 today  , those 152.5 is a 3 bagger right now (6 bagger at today's peak)  if you bought at 0.04 , 150x bagger incoming
What’s spy gonna finish at? 450.63
&gt; I did.
So if I’m correct here. BB smoked some TLRY and now their both high ? 🌝
Do it pussy, prolly sell everything you have and buy puts
are weed stocks getting love from WSB?  Or…?

edit: just trying to figure out why my account is green, ty!
If BB could go up another 90% my jan calls will be ITM!!!
its a high risk high reward play

its worth a shot
Well..
That's what I'm thinking. Cash in on the profit now and bank on BB falling back down by Friday. My 10.5 calls are covered and well above my share price...

Sorta like my options plays. Just winging it
Grabbed a couple calls when it hit 372. Let’s see if we get an eod reversal.

Sell my $11 BB calls for profit and hope that blackberry tanks by Friday or keep bag holding while my $10.5 BB covered calls get called? Feel like BB isn't going to sustain this run up but not sure if it will crash back down this week or not
Buy BB when it's just going to drop down below 10 for another 3-4 months by tomorrow? No thanks

If blackberry hits 12 today I don’t even know what I’ll do but I’ll be berry happy I can tell you that much.
Seems like volume stalling
WISH WISH WISH
This time BB is going to moon ..i just like the stock
Im pretty sure we close at ATH today (highest closing price at post-split price is 883) and maybe even exceed all time intraday price of 900. And if that’s the case will remain relatively flat tomorrow. Honestly I think they will double revenue estimates and likely exceed guidance expectations. Wouldn’t be surprised if we hit 1000 by EOW.
[150x if it continues mooning til Friday , 146.55 today , 149 tomorrow , 152 wed . 155 thur , 158.5 Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qaupdv/comment/hh60fxe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

That 10$ strike looks quite tasty.  Might wait to see if it climbs more first.
die NET die
Infrastructure talks going well....
Very goood for us 😎
Black belt in what?
BB came here to fuck
wow accumulating BB under 10 was actually a good idea, usually I just lose money on trades
Probably a good time to sell TBH. It's a good company, but this valuation is so far beyond anything justifiable, it's crazy.

I mean, this is the single most overvalued stock on the market, by a fair margin.

Who knows, maybe we're in a forever bubble tho.
Buying gme DD: fuck you
That big green dido up the TLRY shorts azz looks so sweet.  Now drive it home retards! You said you'd be back for us and here you are you beautiful autists you. Buy Buy Buy

SQQQ call goes up/down with more delta than QQQ put, is that how it goes?

Checked it out. Not bad, sounds a lot of Avirl Levigne.
Alright, what I'm gonna need everyone to do is sell off your positions in SOFI all at once and use all of the proceeds to buy SNDL real quick. Thanks in advance.
Cummon TSLA, need a huge rally after earnings to win my bet.
$70 was from a very fake post game stop pump lol. It’ll get there again only with legalization. Maybe that happens this year but who knows.

Lol just put an order for 100 15cs for Friday 💯
I’ve got ~$700 to yolo on an earnings play. What’s my best bet?
SDC isnt value?

DKNG isnt value?

TDOC isnt value?

there is tons out there
What do you think?  Add like $50,000 in puts now?
I'm convinced that chappelle gonna have a show on pbs before PLTR hits $30
TLRY just getting started on the road back to $70.  Shorts could be in trouble if shares are bought and sel limits set!!
Oh BB. That’s not just a spike. Oh she’s running. 🤑
Could def go up and I think long term will go way up. But I’d be surprised if it hit like $7.50 in the next two weeks. Still, that’s 50% gains.
Get ready for the daily top 3 ticker thread tmmrw cuz BB did something. Always comes back when BB does good
Yeah I know, won’t be OTC for long just trying to help others get in before the craziness starts
Youll be saying the same when TDOC takes off

Damn DVN just took an arrow to the knee.
You're a first time owner. I can tell.
Rogan thinks a skinny 5”7” white scienstist is a “bad ass” cause they have a black belt. Reminds me of the karate black belt nerd that thought he would challenge the middle linebacker on the football team. I understand dude knows how to do moves but in reality it was so deveststing
Hell yeah. I've had shares for a while. Time for more
Just thinking about 16 y/o me listening to Kush &amp; OJ while smoking drinking OJ. So badass bro 😎
Wow, green on BB...SAAAAAWEET
DKNG going to be a market winner some year between 2022-2025
I realized today that I've been trading options wrong this whole time. Definitely missed out on some fat gains. I guess I do belong here
Why is BB ripping?
Oil is an input cost for pretty much every consumer good. Thus, higher oil leads to higher CPI, leads to higher inflation expectations/bond yields. 

e.g. if Oil were to suddenly rally above 100 and stay there, likely inflation will run high for a long time.

Potentially these moves could force the Fed to act earlier. So people sell in anticipation of earlier Fed moves.

But that's all speculative, next Fed meeting is in 2 weeks... so we'll get some insight there. It could be they just ignore everything and never do anything, kinda like what they did in the 70s.

Higher bond yields leads to investment alternative to equities. Long term yields are more market driven than Fed policy driven. Lots stems from this. e.g. if inflation expectations rise, mortgage rates will rise too, and could dampen housing market.
I have a desire to waste money on NFLX puts  
someone stop me
Anybody gonna try some BB puts for Friday?
Why not buy SQQQ.
Yeah, I’ve been keeping an eye on it debating picking up a Friday call while it’s riding the lower vwap, but it just feels week right now.
Netflix keep going you fuck just touch the line gahhh
Added 30 more shares to my BB position back at 9.40 really wishing I added a 0 to that 30 right about now. Oh well officially out of the bag holder zone and now in the “slightly down” zone
I know I'm getting high with my BB tonight

Oh your sound is cutting out.

BB coming back for me at 14
lol these amzn candles... the fuck
Yummy fruit.
Imagine I had bought $COIN at 200
I’m not confident the pump will continue. So I’ll wait it out. If I lose my put then oh well.
I like $BABA :)
amazon and zillow are juicing my dong 🤤
Further I see this year would be 40, renewable energy over the coming years will only grow so hopefully

TLRY actually has plenty of good news going today. Idk what is going on with BB though
BB bring them tendies.  I knew youd fly again
All these big time money guys on Bloomberg saying correction already happened.  Theres nothing value rn, everythings expensive but theres no sell off inbound.  

I guess SPY 500 eoy ?
ur mum
Another green candle from BB! 
Getting back to $12 this week
Upstart calls/puts? We feeling risky?
Cooling off, I’ll be very interested in Friday 0dte 

Just my opinion
Why the jump in BB?
Why is BB up 10%?
Rebuy
BABA BABY
#you guys all hated me for incessantly shilling BB. I’m legitimately sorry. God bless you all. I am on Cloud 9. What a feeling… 😇 🙏🏻 ❤️
You right. You right.
My Dumbass just got sucked into the GME fomocrazebullshit again.
Not saying they are good just undervalued
add QQQ put here to hedge?
You can just sell the contract to someone without buying it yourself you know, that's the point.
Who’s grabbing more TLRY? Legalization is in the corner.
Please do, then show your loss porn.
BB ripping through the fabric of the universe to make it cyber secure.
I'm finally positive! Green crayons from BB are beautiful!

Greg the snail after a workout 🐌
Blackberry is a tasty fruit, also good vitamins for you
Ban
Also, I did buy calls. I was up 300% on all of them so I sold them.
I think that WAS the case and it’s priced in for that. Plants are opening, they’re being funded, and hiring engineers out the ass. The fraud and fake company bullshit, in my opinion, is offering a cheap ass entry point.
#Ban Bet Won

/u/outdoors58 (1/0) made a bet that BABA would go to 175.0 when it was 162.1 and it did, congrats you fuckin nerd.
Will I go positive on BB this week?!? - sentence I never thought I’d say after buying high.
I bought it at like $32 lol.
Leon phelps "more ladies"
Yeah looking really good
Wants to touch the plane so bad
I think we’re going to see new ATHs in the coming weeks. It’s wildly bullish right now.

Goodluck, there’s gonna be a pullback but who knows when
Has there been some news to make BB pump today?
Can confirm: Will print
I'm looking but they surely aren't giving them away. Weeklies are tempting me
25 eow
This place is best when BB runs 🤠
I'm still holding.
So oil is rallying (gush up 3%), what kind of affect do you think that’ll have on SPY?
Told you man. Should have bought calls. The price not decreasing or increasing is bullish.
thanks greg 🤜🏼🙏🏼
Don’t sell those calls yet! Power hour in an hour!
Imagine that. That would be incredible
If BB passes 12 it’s open season
NFLX giving me big wewe vibes
Good thing I bought the dip on Zillow. Short realtors. Long on data harvesting.
Depends on your expiration I guess. But at the money or just above the money is almost certainly the play for weekly bounces.
Should I hold my QQQ calls that are up 200% - Yes.
Upst looking juicy again 🤑
Sold TRLY at opening because I was tired of bag holding it. It shoots up 10% and it keeps going up ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)

Whenever I get a big win, yesterday NIO and today TLRY my first thought is “if if I was going to buy retarded weekly OtM options why didn’t I go more retarded and further out of the money. 3x doesn’t look nearly as awesome as 6x
Good 4 u

Well that’s net worth tied into their land which ties into their yearly job. A farmer can’t really just up and move and retain their wealth like another wealthy person moving and switching to another high paying job could. But yes I agree overall. Just pointing out farm rich is a little different from rich rich and farm rich is the most common in my area.
PLTR is doing good today. Cathy must’ve sold

Idk but definitely higher after-hours
Sorry for all you listening to Cramer about waiting for bros to crash before buying 🤷🏼‍♂️

The big guys pump … then us retards buy calls … then we lose all the money and they make good money on selling us those calls .

That’s why
If you hate money, downvote me🥺
Feels like charts are getting halted
Nothing works in my favor….. squid games might have hyped it up but idk. Also I think spy will go down today which would fuck it up potentially?
yes and if you sell your shares now, you lose to the buyer who sees gains

Btw, do you think we’ll test previous ATH? It feels like the market is anticipating Tesla will beat earnings but still not move but tbh I think the report this quarter will  shock the market. EPS at least 2$ and automotive gross margin around 30.0%. What do you think?
Only a hand full of stonks are participating in dah rally
I wish all the bulls will become millionaires before Christmas, it will be an awesome journey for us
Where the CLOV ppl at?
Time to bring back the shit ticker discussion containment
BB and TLRY charts similar but why? Why only them? What correlation do they have BB isn’t shorted heavily
Lot of retirement accounts won’t allow that
This earnings momentum could last for a while. I mean we had an insane runup in march-april. Mmmh
and calls too, its either going up or down.
A B A B START
lol you're doing it right yeah, just need to remember to sell low

Hit me BB one more time!!!
Spy time is frozen. Its eerie.
Ouch! Been there one too many times. GL
How does that make any sense? It could dip at any point. It could spike at any point. It’s clearly hit top resistance, and it’s hitting bottom around 450.25. Seems to be hitting at the bottom resistance more than the top right now. So I could see it breaking that bottom and dropping a bit.
What a boring ass day
Spy at $455 yet?
Is this BB’s AMC breakout?
Biden’s approval is so low he’s gonna legalize weed to rehabilitate it.
Sold 2/3 ($30k)and rolled them into monthly spy puts. We recovered way too fast imo
Hmmmm vix is in the 15s
BUG etf picks, and FSLY who just didn’t make the cut. Yet
Oh it’s definitely a trade and not an investment in my opinion. The older the contract, the less valuable it is. That’s just speculation tho and I could be wrong, but buy high and sell. Am I not doing this right?
LIGHT

BABYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

Well looks like BABA and SPY are not filling their respective gaps today. At least I was right about MRNA lol. Lesson learned, look at the 5 day chart of SPY before thinking it will close the gap. As for BABA... pure retard strength.
RISE FROM THE ASHES ALIBABA
MRNA planning on releasing a combo COVID/flu shot.

$WISH is the next stock to explode. I really guess the selling is over. The market has changed. Shit ass news that would pump a stock for 5 seconds then dump it is now pumping a stock 10% and then another 20%. It's funny how it just depends on the mood of the market how a stock will move.
No problem. Godspeed fellow RKT-man!

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/qt1p (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 424.0 when it was 435.1598 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Would have dipped 50+ cents by now
Fuck I was 1 week early on my BABA $170C. Lost like $2K lol
Why do poor people exist when you can just buy SPY calls?
Technicals are bullish, it’s a small bet for fun.
Congrats man, you up overall on your tlry plays now? I got 50 shares a big ago, think it runs a bit more with the attention.
Pleas go up Tim Tesla

Bought EQM before the M&amp;A with ETRN @ 8, it tripled before I was given ETRN stock. Just sold ETRN, 4x investment. 

Thanks, energy crisis!
This play is my Boomer play for $20 EOY.  Poor mans EV play.
With this strong of a pop, TLRY definitely continues to run tomorrow. All in $11.5 weeklies
For how long tho
Baba up 25% the since beginning of the month. Not bad
Getting way too bullish in here… I LOVE IT
TLRY has me so erect! 1000% on $11 calls
I don’t see any news for BB. Wonder what’s up
Super interested in how we close today
Looking at the wrong tickers today then lol
Risk is to the downside
🤣
What’s up with weed?
Based and green pilled
Bullish as fuck.

So Biogen traditionally dips a bit after earnings but it already drilled into the core beforehand...I'm feeling like retard 😏
buying 0.1 Tesla shares every time I see red pretending it will help my calls
WHY IS IT SO HARD TO LOSE ALL MY MONEY!!
Nice working with ya.....

Depends on earnings now. But check Oil and the 10yr. If they keep rallying, we should see a bit of downside.

Kramer pumping BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
now we have to legalize the legalization of weed?
Idk what platform you are looking at. In the end it will go up or down.
Haven’t heard anyone talk about CLOV in a while (not complaining)
And so did I.
Where are my BROS at?

Alright BB I’m in

They aren't bots, they are bag holders.  I know cause I am one.

BB catching up to TLRY 👄
Looks like BB got their own printer after borrowing GME’s too many times
i was doing great not buying fds until today.
OCGN, for the win. 10X
Great move on. TLRY 🚀
🎰📈📉
I dont say cunt very often but when I do generally I'm talking about clov.
For the people in the back

When SPY goes up slowly like today, it is BULLISH
Buying BB weekly FDs always pays off eventually...just gotta stomach those 3 months of losses in between LOL
Neither
dipped today so could go either way tbh. had a good run up to today
Still not sure why I bought TLRY leaps this morning but I’ll take it 🤑
[deleted]
It’s a big fat dildo
They great thing about CLOV is it always gives so many good chances to average down.
So buy calls?
This morning
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
99%
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Nah look at buy/sell candles
Nope.
if you're watching spy than i mean technically you're watching like 500 stocks. 

So keep at it king.
Unless you have your own wallet you never own your key... but holding rebalanced futures vs. holding a spot etf are two different things entirely. Not saying it isn't worth buying, but you probably need to know what you're doing
What yall think of Netflix earnings today? Puts or calls?
😆
Like clockwork. As soon as SNDL hit .70 huge sell off ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
If you’re scared, go to church!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH BUDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Low volume days is when MMs fuk retail bc these idiots think easy mode is back on
I'll buy you a nice dinner at Ruth's Chris
So then when will the correction happen
Who is gonna hit $100 first TLRY or BB?
Boom. BB over $11
Not quite yet
I go to lunch and BB shoots three the goddamn roof. Fack
same here. I ran out of money/courage to double-down further around 140, but perhaps I could have afforded to do a bit more
Thanks for your service
BB has a long future ahead of itself, if you sell now you definitely a retard.

Weed got high today
SoFi 👸🏻
That's why its at 20.41 right now....
BABA going
Smart money flowing into cybersecurity and you’re still ignoring it….
Oh god its going higher?!
Sounds like a good reason for them to sell it down. We'll see
But how can direct be offered when people can’t own their keys?
Who made 20k already off of spy calls ?
Tlry’ s got a boner
The hell?
# shortage on stocks, buy every ticker
What strikes
Or drop hard. Who knows.
The stock market: 'we literally have thousands of stocks to choose from'

Me: 'nah i'd rather struggle watching SPY all day'
I sold my God damn TLRY calls at a loss right before this pump good god dammit fuck it all
Selling calls and watching them bleed is pretty entertaining.
TLRY, BABA, BB all moving up.  Did I take a time machine back to the first quarter ?
Today is the day. Bought 50 more Tilray shares. I will forever hold. Never sell.
Went all in FB
Come one BB just 5 more dollars to go and I'll break even.
BABA up almost 5%. Now just another 20% and I break even.   :')
What the tlry is happening
How positive are you?

25%? 50%?
Shortest I’ve got is April.
[Some live stream announcement they referenced here.](https://www.rocketprotpo.com/)

Not entirely sure but they are making a pretty big deal about it. Between that and enjoying getting hurt by RKT over and over again I figured I would lose a few dollars on a gamble.
Me looking at BB in disbelief today 👁👄👁
Save some for tomorrow...there'll be FOMO for the ones who paper handed today....

If it reaches 15 this week, I will probably cry in the corner mind.
Bb ain’t stopping this time lmao

Eh, you're probably alright. The month is a \*strong\* rebound into green, the week and day are green, and this is the first red hour of the day. One red hour isn't really enough to indicate a reversal to the downside. There's also $4 to go until it's back at all-time high, which was only six weeks ago, and algos love to fill those gaps.

Damn you’re right, it might drop 10% on full volume
Hold
I have some TLRY bags that I’m finally breaking even on (damn I’m cursing myself for not doubling down yesterday even though I considered it). 

Do I hold a bit longer or dump the bags?
6,000 BB shares. Back in the green today!
What is the news on BB wtf??
Everything was and will be priced in
Maybe TSLA
I’ve held this stock since February
Covered calls. A great way to get payed for a limit order 🤣thanks TLRY, I might be bag holding but I'm almost at breakeven
Every damn night.
If you're not in crapto and weed then you ain't black 😊😊
And here I am thinking that I really hope the SNDL covered calls I sold this morning get assigned so I can get some easy profit.

What meme is going to get the afternoon pump today
Virtual conference this afternoon at work. I promise I am giving it my full attention and not just dicking off on Reddit and checking stock charts.
😍😍😍
Y'all are incells
No
I usually do. But it was just meh. Not up or down. Just dithering, regardless of news. Damn it 😂
Thought I’d done reasonably on it last week.
It’s BBs time to shine
Do you work at a Big4 or something? That’s the exact terminology we use here.
BB. Straight vertical
SDC!  Not so small now is it? Only another 45% to break even.
Yes bro - the last cup &amp; handle was the $427 double bottom.. $433 &amp; $434 dips are the outer edges of the cup 

We’re building handle rn.
Why do I feel like ROKU is fucked. Every company is making their own smart TV software now.
Ford is building 4 new plants for EV ? damn.
Im getting scared
WDYM it only looks better when you zoom out. Downside is like 2$ upside is the fcking moon
It’s cups and handles all the  way down to the first tortoise.
I will not FOMO into weed and cell phones I will not FOMO into weed and cell phones
Happy for all my BBros, you guys deserve this.
What happened with bb? Wtf
Nice green candle!

Go weed, smoke me up
I bought calls exp tomorrow and already down 7%. It;s about 2k. Should I sell or hold...
Where’s my BB gang?! BB up we go!
TLRY bagholders with an average buy in of $15 celebrating being only 30% down now I see
Off it goes, those who downvoted this can suck my balls 😂

That does help since I'm a bag holder at $86
#100% Market Suicided,   would they rather throw you off the first floor or the 35th floor.  Long splatter glasses.
Bb go burr
Let's give these bears a little red candle to sit on and then we're gonna keep going higher in the afternoon
Well! It’s up 60 cents so far today, congrats! If it has a day like this every day without ever having a red day, you’ll be at your target price in about five months! 

I bet in reality though 5 months from now it will still be under 12 lmao
BB and TLRY are great, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY HOLD. Not for 3 hours, not for a day, HOLD
I’m a fukin broken record last 4 days:

Goes up 30 dollars in 5 minutes, can’t go down 30 cents in 5 hours. True fukery.
Imagine not buying ANY dip. Literally free money today.
You may be right about SPY, and small businesses going under.  But when I read you post I can't help but thinking it encapsulates the mindset of profits over people.
I work a 9-6, where I work from home. My boss just called me and said he doesn’t have anymore work for me, and I’m free for the rest of the day. I don’t even know what to do with all this free time lmao
TLRY hit $13 for daddy please
If you ever wondered what it feels like to be attacked by money. FSLY and get a feel.
Only stocks but not STONKS🤑🚀
Shits getting shifty when even SPCE turns green. Time to sell some CC’s
Oh boy, here I go again.

Check the chart 🤷‍♂️🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Don't hate the playas hate the legacy of market deregulation.  Cuts both ways.
Lol I’ll toss some physical tlry shares in the bag so you can use them as napkins, best of luck on your plays
it's futures.
This is just too bullish... wtf is going on, VIX is the lowest it’s ever been since the pandemic
Facing ALL of the resistance at 450.50 Keep going SPY ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)

Glad my covered calls assigned last week on BB before I could benefit from this run 🤡

Why did TLRY just shoot into space?
TLRY about to cross $11
No it’s not . Virtually every civilized big Corp has voluntarily asked for the Jab .  These scare tactics which I hate are just trying to get the extra 10% of retards to get the jab
Glad I saw your comment then lol

Damn. Thought there was an announcement for Blackberry and it was organic 

Just saw other meme stocks are mooning too 😔
SPY just double topped.  Grabbed some $445p for Friday.
If BB gets to £20 I might cry. I sold it as I was sick of it faffing around 10 forever.
November. It’s still crawling back from two weeks of red.
&gt; no
If you’re gonna jump on shitty sector may as well jump in the best one. Lots of these guys are bagholding shares btw not calls
yawp
$BB and $SNDL 👀📈🚀
Still a BB and TLRY bagholder

Going up after a good news, weird things

As of today 6% gain and yes, I believe.
Seing the market going nuts today, when puts?
Im gonna enjoy seeing you doordash me some Wendy’s next week ;)
My workplace seems to have slowed down to crawl as of late, as everything has now started to revolve around implementing and managing this mandate. We are a large corporation, and it's an insanely monumental task, with tons of legal ramifications to nativage and negotiate with  customers, vendors, contractors, etc. 

 It's a nightmare, completely sucking down time, energy, resources, and manpower....in an already strained and understaffed environment. I can't even imagine what smaller companies are going through (and will go through). Many smaller firms will just completely go out of business I imagine. This is an enormous attack on our economy and production, make no mistake about it. SPY will be 400 by January.
Absolutely not, they have way more cash on hand bro by far.
Sitting home eating some blackberries and pretzels rn. Feelsgoodman.
I wonder how many new BB bag holders will be sworn in today.

Someone just bought $7.3M in $TSLA calls premium. ITM leaps expiring in February.
 The new bills and attached report language announced by Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT), which are part of a package of legislation to fund the federal government for Fiscal Year 2022, also contain several additional cannabis-related provisions. Among others, they would continue an existing protection for state medical marijuana laws, call on the federal government to reconsider policies that fire employees for cannabis, criticize the restrictive drug classification system that impedes scientific research and encourage the development of technologies to detect THC-impaired driving.

The report for the bill on Financial Services and General Government encourages a review of employment policies for federal agencies with respect to personal use of cannabis:

Yesn't
The best way to help fund the infrastructure problem in this country is to legalize weed and use those taxes for infrastructure. Just fucking do it already so I can finally get paid on my TLRY stonks and get high where ever I want, legally.

No.
Then that's a conviction buy.  Price is what you pay; value is what you get.  If you buy it and some dump happens, what do you care - you don't have to sell.
Grats on the $36
This one’s a slow burn. BA too big to moon
Why are you guys jumping into TLRY. Canopy Growth is the best and biggest weed company with the most cash on hand by far and is beaten down worse than Tilray. Tilray just has the hype of Aphria merger but is still worse positioned

what happened to BB? big green dildos and massive volume
The core problem is simple: Americans are currently buying a record amount of stuff, and that spending binge is crashing the transport and warehousing network meant to move it all.

When the pandemic began, and Americans found themselves unable to go out, households suddenly shifted their spending to goods from services. With the money they saved skipping restaurant meals, movie trips, and vacations, people spruced up their living rooms with new couches, built out home offices, and bought themselves some exercise equipment. Stimulus checks helped fuel the shopping as many employees who’d kept their jobs splurged on TVs and cars. Economists widely expected that, as the pandemic faded, Americans would revert back to their older spending patterns. But that hasn’t happened yet, thanks in part to the delta wave. By August, inflation-adjusted spending on goods was up 14.5 percent compared with pre-pandemic, while services were still down more than 2 percent. As a result of this buying binge, the United States is now actually importing more physical goods than ever before.
right... so i say again. BAN.
It’s okay Sophie, you go when you want to girl ☺️

I think it just bled off so much lately for no reason, it’s making it all back at once
alright got some big money (for me) on a tesla iron condor weekly, no way it goes up an additional 5% after these earnings even if they’re good, and i know retards won’t let it drop that much
I would be in way better shape if I just hadn't done anything yesterday.
Is Robinhood right on $RKLB's market cap? $500M? Its really that much lower than shit companies like Astra ($2.3B) and $SPCE ($6B)?

Analysts are so fucking clueless. When a stock goes up 1000% in a year will raise price targets as it surges always below what it’s trading at. Then suddenly an “expert analyst” says it’s worth $10 less and the market reacts as if their opinions aren’t meaningless.

SDC is up 15 cents and people are talking about how this is it and now it’s on the way to 10 bucks and shit lmao
Well, authorities destroyed over a million plants in a crackdown on illegal growing operations yesterday. That would certainly help legal growers' bottom line. Not sure if that's the direct reason, but maybe?

There isn't a reason for it to really crash.  People aren't going to start defaulting on their expensive loans when we are still in the market that facilitated the high demand.  Lots of people got raises and were able to relocate due to WFH policies.  

If the labor market starts pulling back then the problems will come up but right now I assume everyone taking out expensive mortgages can afford to pay them.

I'm wondering the same thing, it's catching up to its ATH. Currently +100%
This V up on the S&amp;P has been crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

It took a full month to go from ATH 4545.85 to a low of 4278.94 13, then 11 trading days later we're back above 4500 and only 30 points away from an ATH, which they'll probably hit next week during tech earnings wk.

You took this serious which just means you’re projecting bucko.
Any news on TLRY?
Tilrayyyy ❤️
Tilray tues lets get it! Back to $60$$$$$
I'll shotgun a beer in under 4 seconds if it keeps their two week ban in place.
Started last wed
Just bought more TLRY dunny why, but i think we are going to MOON today
I just grabbed a single $1k call 3 weeks out for shits and giggles, so that would be fine by me.
Dumb bitch
BA is startig
In the last month, TDA messaged me claiming regulators tightened up and the 4th trade is now an instant 90-day ban.
Honestly, it was a mistake, because the valuation was cartoonish. I love my $NET for example but I’m not touching more shares at like 110 price/sales. ZG was in similar territory but I wanted to own a piece of it without doing DD on its value (stupid). I have been buying a lot of shares since it hit 100 because I still am bullish on it, Redfin and Opendoor to disrupt such a fucked up industry, but we’ll see. I’ll hold for at least three years to let it play out
Loaded up more AFRM $155 10/22’s
Why is TLRY popping? News?
tsmc in the streets, tsla in the sheets
You ***can't*** nuke one city anymore. Nuking triggers automatic nuking of other cities which triggers automatic nuking of other cities.

Be honest with yourself. You’re using the internet to live a different reality then your actual life as a degenerate incel who has been getting picked on and beat up the majority of your short lived life. In real life nobody is scared of you they just feel sorry for you so why would Reddit be any different?
Puts on tlry?

Haha why?
What does SEC say about GameStop? Are they done?
Long story short but traditional computers use bits for processing and storing information in 1s and 0s. Quantum Computers use qubits which is both 1 and 0 at the SAME TIME - sounds retarded? Welcome to the quantum world. 

People think quantum computers is just a "faster computer" - it's Not. it's an entirely new different mode of computation that unlocks the quantum world and manipulates subatomic particle. Through this we can discover new materials, discover new drugs for cancer and diseases, optimise battery technology, scale up AI and automation (people think AI is the future but don't know it will never become a reality without QC). Many other things. I'm too drunk to explain in further detail.

There will be geopolitical tensions between China and USA in the quantum race. China is apparantly ahead at the moment...

Its at an 850-900 billion market cap. Stocks like that don’t move and the volume on this pump has been abysmal unlike January. I think it dumps regardless but if it dumps with good earnings we see 1000 by February if they beat in Q4

Permanent labor program sounds much more sinister than it actually is: full-time employment
I’m too fuckin dumb to make a banbet. Good
Why are you like this
The rocket stopped. I’m all for it since I’m loaded up on put debit spreads. The fall will be contingent on how good earnings are. If it beats it WILL tank but itll drop to 750-800 and then grind up again
You buy after the stocks fall. You should’ve been buying oil, airlines, travel last year and beaten up tech this year
I've been spending significantly less time on WSB this week and am making significantly more more. Coincidence? You decide.
Roku come on babeh
Call them.  They’ll remove it - only once though.
There's actually a lot of good looking dips right now, seems like a lot of names are still recovering from that ghey bear run we had for a few weeks

Okay the first paragraph was kinda cringe but then you said Google owns 11% so I bought 100 shares

You’re right. I should have looked into the future and bought when it falls. That’s why I haven’t bought SPY for the past 10 years
This is what I'm leaning towards

IMO, Bears are trapped in 23andME…12M shares needs to be cover. Hard to borrowed. Borrowed interest rate is 16%. Low float.

You learn by doing, it's the only way.  Trial and error is key, don't be afraid to make mistakes, google everything you don't know, use libraries instead of reinventing the wheel whenever possible.  If you're in way over your head, you hopefully have higher skilled teammates to point you in the right direction, don't be afraid to ask for help.

You can’t open any new positions for 90 days through robinhood?
On average the IV crush on options after Tesla earnings is 11%
They may be 50% rubber and probably manufactured in 1982 China, but they are pretty tasty
Yes I’m well aware of that. Are you saying that you don’t want it to keep running up or something?

You won't be able to day trade for 90 days.
What's a qubit though? In all seriousness finally I find something on here worth investing in
Everything's green. How do I know what to buy? Wake me up when bears are popping up champagne, then I'll step back in.
dose anyone know when the VIX earnings is?? i cant find anything on the gGoggle
You get unlimited day trades for the day. Then no more day trading from tomorrow
It ran 50% in a few months where were you?
Down over 50% on Zillow (ZG) shares, but I’m not selling because I don’t want to give my accountant another reason to awkwardly swivel in his seat and say “Have… you considered index funds?” I’m doing it for him; the poor guy is tuckered out and he doesn’t need the stress, you know?
BITO is now offered. Any thoughts on it?
Comparing it to a PS5 at all is absurd in the first place, which is what the person I replied to did. 

How about this. Put your money where your mouth is and buy long dated puts on AAPL. The technical specs are irrelevant ultimately to my point which is AAPL is a cash machine.
I dare you to hold your TSLA calls past earnings 🙊
CCJ is the play
Hmm good point. Way less volume today and usually has a dip after low volume days. 1dte puts might be the play.
SDC the play easy money
got a 72% on my accounting test. that class is bullshit, why not just look up the financial statements like a normal person?
Definitely has nothing to do with the failed trial

you'll get used to it. or maybe you won't, but you'll probably be fine. i wouldn't stress too much about putting in extra hours that you aren't getting paid for. you might make some mistakes, it is okay
I run clinical trials.  Every day I wake up to 10 emails offering me $10K to speak "confidentially" to some Wall Street bro for an hour.

I'd be breaking several laws as well as contracts I signed if I took them up on it.  But the fact that I keep getting these emails suggests that this is, in fact, how one finds out.

How do you overcome imposter syndrome in tech?

Say you took a course on python, sql but you just watched videos, maybe did a project on it using the tools you learned.

Then you go into a new job where you say you have python/sql experience (which is true).

But when it comes to it, everything seems to be coming at you fast and you don’t know if you’re capable of doing these python projects since they’re not beginner level. How do you overcome that? You got the job for a reason (passing the basic technical test). Do you really just need to deep dive and spend a lot of time watching more videos to be able to do the project? Outside of work hours as well?

I like how you changed the subject. You can't say a MacBook is better than a ps5 because it has 21 hr battery life when you cant even get 21hrs gaming out of it. I was pointing out how dumb your comparison was. Where did imply I would play a game for 21 hrs straight?  Grasping at straws I see
IONQ is worth two billion dollars. They have a 79 qubit computer. When they reach 1500 every shit $COIN address becomes hackable. Every little dirty secret you have on the internet is up for grabs. 

I know you morons think in days, if not minutes. But add this one to your long term retirement plans. Google owns 11% of IONQ shares, so they know who's boss in quantum computing.
I think you could hold and still get more gains! But I am definitely no expert on it lol
Theres crazy skew. Call side way too limited to juice the squeeze. Even if TSLA beats it can go down. 

25% possibility for 6-1 payout is +EV in the long run.

Nah, I lost 20,000 when they dropped on earnings in Oct 2020. It was stupid af so I can’t be me at anyone but myself but I haven’t touched FSLY since.

I was up 200-300% on all my calls for SPY. Sold them because I’m very worried of the drop coming. Volume is slowing down.
It might not be popular or cool to say it, and a lot of folks may be offended, but Richard Branson didn't go to space. He just flew really high up and said he went to space. Puts on SPCE.
Just take the money and see what happens after earnings it’s parabolic it might make another attempt at 880 but who knows if it dumps after earnings buy in again I will

if you do poor man cc, you can sell 2x dec 7.5CC and get $2.1 each, $420 total. That brings the 5c leap cost basis to like $2.6 each, meaning break even price at $7.6. kinda weird option pricing, no??

Stupid but honest question: Does trading activity in SPY affect the price of SPY? Or is it solely the underlying index and stocks within it that move the price of the fund? I ask because a few moments ago it looked like SPY was hitting resistance at $450
AXSM taking a breather day, down a whole ten cents after surging nine bucks in five trading days.

Anything under fifty offers amazing potential rewards near term and beyond. Company is eagerly awaiting approval for their crown jewel drug AXS 05. Just yesterday they agreed to terms on additional financing in anticipation of the big rollout of the multi billion dollar blockbuster depression treatment.

Analysts have targets as high as north of $150 for the stock, which also has a second drug under FDA review and a decision date of April 30 next year. And to top all of that, Axsome has two more drugs in advanced clinical trials with applications expected late next year.

Reminder, do NOT buy options on AXSM. The premiums are very high and we don't know when exactly the FDA approval will come in (if ever). But expectations are for literally at any time, any day.

Just buy the stock at $40 and hold. I do not suggest taking any partial profits because imo, that's just throwing money away. Why take a partial at $50 if the stock is a near certainty to hit $100.

Long shares. Good luck.

DAMMIT RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT I DID IT
Fed has to make tough choice: (1) let the bubble continue and drive up inflation OR (2) pop the bubble to stagnate inflation.


If (1) happens, need to be invested in the market
If (2) happens, need to be cash gang


Which way you going to bet?
If I could trade options in my tax sheltered account I would. But I gotta buy shares. Can we still be friends?

I sold my calls at 450 and bought one put. Only one. Expires Friday. If it starts to trend down again then I’ll load up on some more. If it keeps going up I only lost one contract. I’ve been kinda doing that as a test and then loading up once the trend is set.

It seems way to many people fomo’d into SOFI after its 35% gain in the past month. Love the company but you guys might be idiots. Pullback always happens eventually meanwhile this thread has a bunch of people getting mad. Don’t be so damn late and you won’t mind a down day. Shares and leaps will be fine, if you bought weeklies Godspeed but you’re a special kind of gambler.
You’d think SOFI was down like 15% the way people are talking about it on here

Hm. That’s same gain for lots of market though. I’d figure a bit down because of inflation hurting costs, supply chain, bad outlook because of those, and bad because of vaccine. But I don’t follow JJ much.

[Backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government.](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm)

I understand it seems wild, but I bonds compound every 6 months and the rate is based on 2 factors: fixed rate (currently 0%) and past 6 months CPI-U.  You buy a rate for 6 months on your purchase date; and the available rate resets on 5/1 and 11/1.  Current annualized rate is 3.54%, on 11/1 that resets to 7.12% (because of the insanely high CPI-U reads over the last 6 months - literally the highest on record), average those out for a 5.33% return for the next 12 months.  You could also wait until 11/1 to buy and get the 7.12% annualized rate immediately but you won't know what the back half of your year looks like until May.

TL;DR:  It is in fact totally guaranteed.

Oh goodie ATH it's buying time
Not sure why they are pushing all the obscure shit that no one cares about.
I already had an incredible few months. Got out of most things before expiration. Getting ready to hop in on some earnings. 0dte been small fun. When we closed above 433 knew this shit would rip. Didn’t know how much! Laying low at the moment.

U cared enough to comment
I’m just saying we definitely share, not that we don’t want cars. Many people get cars expressly to share rides.
If you're holding cash and have a family look into I bonds, guaranteed 5.33% return if you purchase before Nov 1st.  That beats Marcus high yield savings.  You can buy $10K per family member per year.  No state or municipal income tax on the interest either, lookin at you Yonkers residents
Yes - also the stocks like TSLA MSFT AAPL are mooning which raises the value of SPY - its nature as an ETF

That was me, sorry. Which way is the emergency clinic again?
Once it breaks $78, calls.
Bros if you’re up on puts but can’t sell due to day trade pdt shit, how do you secure profits? If it were calls I know just sell one strike above, what about when puts?
Indeed, the top is a bullish indicator for more top
The way this market is artificially moving up means this MF’r is going to crash hard.   Fuck, wow!
Will SPY stay above 450 this week? I'm afraid it may pull back
More to the tune of $3k, after several $5k failures.  Account ATL.
I had TSLA 850's last week. If they were closer in or further out I'd be fucking everything right now.
Ur fukt
Since spy hit 450 everything is stagnant overall.
I would sell some and roll the rest to a longer date….if I thought it was a good long term play OTM

«Lets try to dodge the question»

Sure. Since you didn’t read it, heres a snippet for you.

«Short interest can exceed 100%—as it did with GME—when the same shares are lent multiple times by successive purchasers. If someone purchases a stock from a short seller and subsequently lends the stock out again, it will appear as if the stock was sold short twice for the purpose of the short interest calculation. 75

Short interest ratios tend to be quite low; for large non-financial stocks, they are often less than 2.5% whereas for small non-financial stocks they still tend to be less than 13%.

Few stocks, if any, have short interest greater than 50% on a given date.76 Until recently, short interest of more than 90% was observed only a few times—in 2007 and 2008. When examining short interest as a percent of shares outstanding, GME is the only stock that staff observed as having short interest of more than shares outstanding in January 2021.»

Pg 26

Now maybe you can produce a link to «shit earnings»
for the company with 0 debt, e-commerce, Ex-Amazon board members and confirmed &gt;100% SI in january. I trust you saw figure 6 in the report you read of short sellers not buying jack shit back? That obviously means SI is probably 0 by now, thats how numbers work in burgerland i guess.

Edit: It’s also kind of funny how 100% of the float was voted earlier this year, even though i sure as shit didnt vote, and a fuck ton of other people never got the chance either because of not being american. Vote to float rate tends to be 32% for retailers, yet somehow every single share of the float voted to the dot, and keep in mind reporting votes above 100% is illegal without having a 3rd party audit all of them in a seperate vote-count. Shorts sure as shit covered.

WOAH easy there with that earth shattering prediction
Of course, but while some of this is true, there's much more to this than what the average person hears as far as benchmarks and "garbage".  Smaller micron arch isn't the bench mark, the gateway (bottleneck) is, and Intel's gateway is on par or better than competitors.  They are going about he problem in a different way than the competition rather than going smaller.  Intel has fallen behind on delivery, which is their biggest problem.

We need Tesla to turn around and help carry spy to new highs!
If you lose half your money, that means someone else doubled theirs. 

Your money 100% to 50% = -50% or 1 - .5 = .5

Other person's money 100% to 200% = +100% or 1+1=2

So one person has a loss of .5 and the other has a gain of 1. This leaves a net positive of .5

This is 5th grade math, don't try to apply logic to it, just go with it and have faith that stocks only go up, and your losses are actually a good thing.

Thx. When I played Rec softball we played a team sponsored by them and couldn't beat them so obviously I can't invest in them j/k
You made a really short custom ban bet (None) which was not accepted.
Don't put any text after the time token (1m, 1w, 15d) if you don't intend to carry out an interesting punishment to get unbanned early.

I have finally crawled my way back into only a triple digit loss on BABA. I consider this a win.
I see. Thanks! However, I remember in some post-OP mentioned CEO said their results were better than Merk's pill. So I would still advise people to fact-check and not to trust 100% what the company says about their product.

&gt;and things are changing within.

Yes, but you won't see those changes this year, and probably not even next year. The problems are too deep to be solved within a few quarters.

The upcoming CPU is already garbage according to leaks, needs almost twice the wattage of last year's high-end Ryzen just to catch up on single-core performance (while still lagging in multi-core performance), and will be incompatible with old games because $INTC thought it was a good idea to experiment with DRM tech changes.

The fab is not gonna save them, their manufacturing process is still lagging behind TSMC, and there's no way $AMD &amp; $NVDA will remain silent while Biden subsidizes a failing fab, they will obviously push for TSMC's US fab to be subsidized too.
 I’m just Gona leave this here about something I said about AAPL and SPY yesterday:

SPY really about to have 5 green days in a row, huh?
Bought yesterday at close, but sold first thing in the morning for a small profit.  I still think it’s a good play, but I didn’t buy myself enough time.
&gt; I am not a financial advisor.
Coin be battling back
You fucked up your format - you want **!banbet SPY +2% 1d** or **!banbet SPY 500 1w** or **!banbet GME 0 1d I'll eat a bar of soap**
You’ll be rich dude with no balls.
Hope y’all bought into that NET dip.
Cloudflare x Enron
He literally comes in here makes an outrageous banbet and then loses and is banned. 2nd time now
Why did this not work?
$INTC datacenter sales are going to suck again and we all know which stock is gonna profit from that. Even Intel's new CEO admitted there were deep problems within the company and that the previous CEO fucked up. You can't expect those problems to be solved within a few quarters. $AMD calls are the play.
You said "calls" in  your original post.  Calls are options.  What kind of buy did you do - Market, Limit, etc.  If you did a market buy it's going to fill your order at the market price at the time (which means it can go up or down between the time you push the button to buy and your order fills), if you did a limit it will buy at the price you set your limit at or better if you have that set up.  Check out some youtube videos and try to learn as much as you can before diving in.  There will always be trades waiting for when you've dusted up a bit - take it from me - been there done that.
SPCE bear flag, or maybe it just trades flat the rest of the day, or maybe it shoots up. I don't know what I'm doing.

Hey it went back up!
Can spy break 450 today...
Always the last two weeks before earnings. I’ve made so much money off of this…
You don’t really believe any of this do you?
[deleted]
GME always pumps before earnings. Earnings coming in December. That is the perfect time to sell a fuck ton of call credit spreads on it as I always do. Then of course earnings is shit since it's a shit stock and it dumps hard. Rinse and repeat. 

Any pump does not validate your "1-yr wedge" bullshit. It's the normal pump and dump cycle that all of us play.
the fall drop is officially over. it ended last weds. only thing that can kill this bull run is actual tapering, but we got 2 full weeks until FOMC, so it's calls, calls and what's that..... CALLS..
PTON monthlies for earnings anybody?
Bah gawd AAPL came to play.
Don't buy UVXY unless and until the jaguar falls out of the tree. It's a scummy product that goes to zero and reverse splits every 6 months.

If you do buy it now, go full retard and get just a few  50 strikes expiring in Nov. If we get a volmageddon event they will earn 30,000%

Another way to play is wait until it's totally crushed (only bulls everywhere) and buy VXX and sell at the next pop for a little gain. Repeat

is this a pro tip or
Lesson learned from 4 years of unsuccessful options trading…price always goes up or down more than I think it will. Buying opposite directions just because it moved a lot in one way is a suckers bet

&gt; A bear flag is a technical chart pattern that forms when price action declines and then consolidates. The consolidation typically occurs as a result of the bulls stepping back to assess their position, or because of profit taking by the bears.
cant permanently kuck the zuck 🤷🏻‍♂️
Guh!
I have a soft spot for pltr. Made 4k last year in Nov
Cost-push inflation is bad for almost everybody. Companies that already operate on tight margins are going to be hit hard if demand for their products is elastic, or substitutes exist with more flexible margins. *Some* companies will be able to tighten margins and maintain their income. Even fewer will be able to make better profits, which is why I keep pushing commodities. Inelastic supply plus inelastic demand means they can set their margins relatively high and still ship the same number of units. 

The best part is that demand-pull inflation can be controlled with interest rates and bond purchases (and companies can reduce demand by raising prices/increasing margins, thus obtaining pricing equilibrium). When the cost of inputs increase, they only come down when supply catches up. This is going to be a while. We haven't seen supply-chain issues of this magnitude before. People are unhappy with wages, which will also increase cost of production. You've got people going on strike because they don't want to be forced into vaccination, creating more of a labor shortage. Things aren't great.
100% doesn’t matter anymore
I got a good feeling about this one.
I'm up 409% on my APPLE 150c I bought yesterday morning. TOO BAD I JUST THREW $200 AT IT FOR FUN. I do have a good $1k on 145 calls that are doing alright too but they are further out so not as volatile. Then I have a $4k risky bet on a small cap that's been just sitting at a 10% returns. Man if I could just put more on the real winners I would be rich. Jk I would be poor as fuck because I would never get it right.
My strategy of buying LEAPS on shitty memeable stocks in hopes that you idiots will pick a couple up is going extremely poorly
do you know what a bear flag is? Look it up then come back
Need FSLY at 60 so I can drop this motherfucker.
&gt; VXX is a terrible investment. It's basically just an exchange traded note that tracks the S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index, which is itself based on the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). The VIX measures volatility expectations in the stock market over a 30 day period. When people are scared of losing money in stocks, they buy VXX because it goes up when stocks go down and vice versa.
C
If you look at SPY chart vs volume today, all the high volume is when it's choppy or going down, and when volume drops it all drifts up.

Traditional technical analysis says this is bearish.

PLTR is just a shitty investment. Look at its graph over the last year - if you got in at the start of December after the initial moonshot from 9 to 27, you'd have made -$3 per share. Fucking GE, the most boomer of boomer stocks, has made 25% over that same period. IBM about the same.

Yeah but small caps outperformed.  We've been following same seasonal patterns so far this year almost to the day.

Could see something like a 10-15% move in small caps versus a 5% move in big caps.

We all know you apes are dumb, but this "shorts didn't cover" shit is next-level dumb -- as in lack of grade school reading comprehension dumb. Did you even read the fucking report? The report states that the majority of the run-up was not due to shorts covering but rather from retail euphoria. That does not mean that shorts didn't cover, you troglodyte. It means that short-covering was not the primary driver of the price run-up. It's really not hard to understand.
Gave everyone my $MARA puts play way in advanced. Up 200% already. I also called out the $AAPL IV spike (200% on calls with no movement over the weekend). I literally give everyone winners here.
Made money so not mad however I always literally always sell to early.

Except they probably wouldn’t be nearly as productive under those circumstances, as they’d burn out because they don’t have the prospect of slacking off and resting to reward themselves with and to keep them motivated.
I think the secret to making money in the stock market is to just buy every stock so that you'll always have something green even if the others  are red.
My entire career has comprised construction, architecture, real estate sales and development, so I should be more knowledgeable about the homebuying process than most...if I didn't know any better I would say that certain portions of it are intentionally opaque - like in what world does a layman understand the mortgage offering language about servicer vs originator, packaging and selling the loan, etc.

No one wants to admit it but no one is as productive at home as in the office. At home you have good distractions.
The real question is why do you never learn?
It caps your profits way too much
They told me to also get critical illness and income protection insurance (so I can keep paying my mortgage in case I get run over by a car and end up in a wheelchair or if I go crazy and can't work because I will be sent to the nuthouse). Home insurance is included in the service charge that I will pay to the gated community. No need for flood insurance.
Maybe we'll see some bear gain porn
Maybe they are so productive they get their shit done in no time so they can spend the rest of their day relaxing as opposed to pretending to be working while at the office.
Why the Fuck is PG down, the earnings beat estimates— WHY THE FUCK DO STOCKS ALWAYS DO THIS??
Ok, upst, back to 390 so I can offload these bad decisions.
Death to the memes.

Trust me, I know. Check my account history. My biggest money makers EVER are selling call credit spreads on the memes during pumps. Up over 400k so far on that alone.

Hope you all loaded up on the $AMD &amp; $TSLA dips.
Then you're like, new fridge, furniture, water softener, whatever. I've already spent 500K+ what's another couple Gs
I’m feeling it right now
New currency is debt, huh, wait, what, you can pay debt with debt, huh, learn something new everyday. Hard assets = future.
Whenever people talk about how productive they are working at home I just check the Xbox app and see half them on. People have very delusional fantasy’s about how much work they get done at home.
You have a down payment and closing costs 
Down payment for a first time buyer is 3-5% 
Closing costs are 3-4% of the sales price 
You have to get homeowners insurance 
Flood insurance is required for only homes in a flood zone 
You’re buying a house. Not a car. Pull your pants up and get the mortgage company the correct documents and stop whining.

Ah I'm a retard never. I'm the idiot I was thinking of trailing stop losses

RIOT bulls lmao
Buying a house was wise for boomers. Not anymore unless you're in a really good place long term and it can be an investment.
SPY has become my new best friend
I really need to sell when I’m up instead of being greedy I’m dumb
Depends on what your goals are I guess, I've seen that people most commonly write CC's with 3-6 week expiry's.
APPL is the market
Bought AVIR. A little late, but it's the move.
Wtf why is remitly tanking

NIO doing bits today
Ummm
No.
Anyone in WDC?
I mean I’ve used them in the past and the other commenters replying agree it’s possible. Maybe your broker doesn’t allow it?
Don’t fight the trend if your fucked
Holy cow fcel is getting raped.

&gt; Schwab is a great bank. I have no idea why you would use Chase.
Yeah, hedgies definitely out to get your ten dollars.
How likely are you to hold a losing trade for 2 or 3 years???? Why not buy leap calls instead???
Anyone know when CRTX will drop phase 2 trial results? Their last company press release said anytime before the Nov 9th CTAD conference. Just wondering if anyone has heard anything else?
I did AMD calls March 2022 because I'm a pussy lol
ZS $300 again
Why’s it always feel like whenever I buy an option It tanks shortly after
Way to jinx it dik head
I’m with Schwab! Maybe Chase doesn’t offer it? I’ve never used them
APPL is going to pay for my new Garmin watch. Thanks Timmy. Sorry Iwatch zuccs ass.
&gt; Tesla is a great company. I would buy the stock if it was trading at $100, but not at these levels.
[deleted]
Lol you right. But you can't use stop losses on options friend. Only on stonks
Yea they really pile on the fees when you buy, I guess they figure when you are throwing around 6 digits for the house, you won't notice /sweat a few hundred here, a few hundred there, seems like peanuts in comparison.
But Netflix calls for earnings?
If you’re not buying this tsla dip you’re dumb
Sell Tesla calls?

Does anyone write covered call leaps?
Who’s your broker I have chase investments
It's fucking wild man 

Just get your cheque book out and bend over
$BB The important things are 1. the stock is stable and promising 2. it is part of the big three meme stocks. The only reason why it has not mooned yet is the whales keeping it down and paying a ton to do so. Once that's done I see $BB above $100 but I am a retard and don't know how to use commas so no financial advise.

Spy pp going into cashflows butthole
Nothing is gonna go wrong with this ETF, no siree...
Markets are green and every investment I own is red 

Just end me
I didn't know buying a house was so stressful. It's not just mortgage, I need to get 3 different insurances, there are service charges, weird fees etc. Feeling so stressed now, would help if I made some money on stocks today.
Yes. I'm not going to tell you what to do with your money but it makes no sense to sell before earnings at the price it's at currently.

All the hedgies knew I was buying calls.

Me too, brother. So many people are just trying to make a quick buck. This shit will never get anywhere if people don't let it grow.
my november spy calls are way back from the dead, like a risk managing FOOL i scaled out of the position and now i have cash burning a hole in my pocket...such a strange position to be in 

might buy some brk/b to feel like i'm making a 'smart investment' or some boring shit but open to suggestions
I averaged down on my Tesla calls. Hopefully it pays off but knowing my luck this shit is gonna bite me on the dick
Well, my TSLA calls are fucked.
TSLA may go down below 850 soon

Is it too much to ask for SPY to melt up to 455 on low volume?
Had a stop loss on 865 just incase
Not me, I'm holding strong on PLTR!
Protecting profit makes me an idiot? It’s too early for this aggression lol
Awaiting the “why tf did I buy poots” comments in 15 mins. 😅
We are not supposed to know about options because we are stupid. That's how those motherfuckers make money

Options gives people with little to no money the opportunity to be rich. They absolutely hate it. And they say “it’s not safe don’t do it” to deter people say from it
Yeah that’s how delta works? Lmao
SDC is on the Reg SHO list. Earnings pushed up to Nov 8th. This shit is going to fly soon.
Good to see all my stocks jump off a cliff at the same time. +6% to -2% in 3 minutes. As is tradition

Imagine thinking the 10 yr is going down lmfao
Zillow just gave you another juicy dip for you to accumulate 20mins ago.
&gt; Yes, you can place stop losses on options.
The layers of stupid in this comment gave me cancer
Wtf is Cramer saying "**No Options**" Why so against options. GTFOH, leap options are better than stocks you dickhead. The only way to make money with little money. They hate it that retail knows about options.

TSLA correction. 

TSLA may go down below 850 soon.
Just praying for Disney. 🥲
Fuck off bears
Here's a problem and why valuation eventually matters.

You have IBM which I know is a dying dinosaur but they still make $75B rev and $5B net income per year at a $100B market cap, the same as SNOW which makes about $270M per quarter.  How long will it take Snowflake to make $75B per year even at a 50-100% growth rate?  Decades probably.  

By the time they get anywhere close to even $10B revs im sure someone will have come along and duplicated their tech.   Everyone will be and is already in data managed cloud services.
Oh great PLTR had a modest gain, better sell everything! Patience you retards.
Fucking sell it so we can V recovery
I bought today morning 🤡
$ADBE with the $QQQ carry right now.

Market flat since open, but all my overnight profits have bled out.
You’re flying the rocket the wrong way Elon!!
Volume on BB 🤯
Still tanking though.
because you're not doing it right...you have to say "catch you on the flippity flip"
Yea I sold my 930 c to make like 400 bucks . I was really hoping for that tune to 900 but then I thought earnings is always a scary thing wit tsla even if they do good it can drop
Legit every single time I touch Tsla it goes down. But when I don’t play calls
It moons. How
Fredo crushing the dreams of apes
Maybe you’re right, I have this friend who I think might be more in the acquaintance category, he always says he’ll catch me later, but then when I fall he’s never quick enough
10 year squeezing. Lock in that 1.61 now before it tanks
Same as always - the hope dildo's followed by sliding all day. I truly believe its done on purpose to suck retail into the intentional selling
It’s the worst
Toilet gang check in 😎 you know what time it is!

Hey SPY, can you figure your life out?
Honestly judging by the after hours comments recently this place would be a good place to advertise that.
I’m calling the crude top, all in on QQQ
Come on $NVDA I just need you to go down 1% so that I can get rid of these puts and buy $AMD calls cheap. You can then moon as you wish.
Daily anal drilling now in progress. I'm getting fukt.
Picked up a few Vz calls. Gambling is so fun. 🤣
Who bought coin at the top?  Lol 😂
I made the same bet at 52 and rolled it over into CROX at 138. I believe in both Co's, but they're achieving my ceiling far quicker than anticipated ....
sp00ky
In hindsight maybe it wasn’t a good idea to buy LEAPS on a Canadian electric school bus startup
Remind me! 1 day

LMFAO
People talking about TSLA but NIO has been on a crazy bull run these past few days. 50s seemed like a dream a few days ago but with upcoming catalysts it's looking possible now
today? cash
Yeeeaaahhh, there the green
A slow climb on the 10 year isn't so bad is it? It indicates a strong market, which is why the government has the need to increase interest rates to stay competitive. I'm not sure at which point it goes from strong market to too competitive with the market. Bit I guess it is getting there since this Momentum might scare money away for a little while in anticipation of a correction that no one seems to think will happen.
PLTR is running… plant heads grab your tiki torches!

Yes, almost two years, but that was just to learn the inside of the business. Great to learn the operations, other sectors of the markets (bonds, forex, futures), they train you very well and you get paid for it.

Turnover is high because you’re going to take shit from legitimately stupid people multiple times a day, you have to have a thick skin. You’ll eventually meet a lot of people in the role that just took the job to be zombies, find the people that have a passion for the industry.

Don’t expect to be actually talking about individual stocks with the majority of your calls until you’re in a trade position and even then, most of the actual traders are calling in to get a fill, not talk shop.

Since you’re already a trader you’ve got a good chance to move out of the starting investor services role. 

I got bored of it, especially with work from home. If you started now you’d likely be in the office by the time you got through broker training. They usually start you on the phones ASAP, and sometimes right after the SIE test because they need people to take calls for the easy shit (and to see if they want to invest thousands of dollars)
Cuz u retarded af stop buying calls

The "Black Monday" stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, saw U.S. markets fall more than 20% in a single day. It is thought that the cause of the crash was precipitated by computer program-driven trading models that followed a portfolio insurance strategy as well as investor panic.

No, because the buyer is adding value to the home by fixing it up. In the mid 2000s people were buying homes and just holding them. They would then sell them when homes went up. No value added

I dont think most people care. They are caught up on the bullish hype atm, and I can't really blame em. Everyone just be smart. I've lost nearly all my 2021 gains in the last month trying to short
Glad you clarified
Damn ur salty too. But, you summed up the situation better than me. That’s literally what it is, hedge funds being greedy is not a conspiracy its basically a known fact, just like its a known fact they shorted over 100% of the float. Its not complicated, its not a conspiracy, its an amazing play that you will regret not being a part of for the rest of your life.

There is no such thing as turning a short into a far OTM put.

Figure 6 shows that shorts covered - according to your theory they didn't cover but instead bought far OTM puts - if your theory was correct then there would not be large short seller buy volume on those days.    

From Page 25 "In seeking to answer this question, staff observed that during some discrete periods, GME had sharp price increases concurrently with known major short sellers covering their short
positions after incurring significant losses. During these times, short sellers covering their positions likely contributed to increases in GME’s price."

A major thrust of this report was to put to bed conspiracy theories like naked shorts are using far OTM puts to kick the can down the road - if that was the case they would have called that out here.    That isn't the case.
I need a broker that lets me buy stock in places like turkey, Greece, Africa. 

those have "de risked" valuations. And if one just skips the next years pe4 stocks and pays up say 8X earnings one can buy quite damn good businesses lol.

My timing has been awful. I timed Covid correctly by selling in January and buying in April. However, I watched the market hit ATH for 4 weeks before the crash. 

I believe you will see a crash. Perhaps it happens next year, but valuations still remain high. Economic conditions are horrible. Millions don’t have jobs. Millions can’t pay their rent. We are facing a monetary and potentially fiscal cliff. Oh, and rates will need to rise if we ever want to cut them during the next recession. I say we have a recession by next year as consumers can’t handle rising prices

I think so, the hype is building up.
Vegan food is trash
Cards on the table: I'm bullish GME; why are people acting like the info in that report was somehow revelatory? Yes the SEC have better data than dweebs on Reddit, but all they did was give a rundown of January's highlights - we all know everything that was in the report already. Bulls and bears will now argue about whether the SEC thinks shorts covered or not instead of other evidence pointing to them having covered jack shit in Jan (deep OTM puts and deep ITM calls by the truckload, ETF shorting, shady offshore option holders appearing on Bloomberg etc etc). Arguing about whether the SEC says covered or not covered in the report is completely meaningless in either case.
It says they didnt cover in January, and that retail buying pressure mostly from this very fucking sub is what caused the spike, mostly.

Bruh everyone is BEGGING to get out of their house. Everyone I know is going everything they can outside of their home to socialize. Just because they have a extremely successful show doesn't mean all other metrics are green? Why am I going to buy Sony stock just because they had a fantastic release? Ain't make no sense l. Netflix has a successful show but they don't have shit else to watch anymore, just a bunch of meh shows. I mean look at the top 5 on Netflix right now. With the exception of squid games, they all b or c rated meh shows. I think long term they are absolutely the play as they shift to their own content, but short term I'm bearish for sure.

No. Contractors are literally refusing to build rn due to the cost of materials. Not as much of a supply chain problem for lumber either. Anyone who owes a sawmill can tell you nothings changed since precovid. It’s just the middlemen in between the contractor and sawmill fixated on selling for an outrageously high price.

There are similarities (crazy valuation, crazy cult of shareholders) and differences (tesla makes a product that the market wants, tesla is profitable, tesla is growing fast)
well they can do what everyone else does and get free money by issuing a bunch of new shares and then people buy the dip and everyone forgets the dilution

I think that buying into earnings will continue today too. We might have the correction to fill the gaps but it looks to me that buyers are in control.
Does this cover STDs
Cool. So then we just live in a pretend world where the value of the company is exponentially more than revenue or even extrinsic factors? I get it, hedgies bad. Doesn't mean we get to live in lala land.
Again closing isn’t strictly covering , they’ve been rolling them into otm puts over and over

Say you’re in a cult without saying you’re in a cult.
&gt; Tesla is a company that makes electric cars. It has no revenue and it loses money every year. The market cap of Tesla is $50 billion, which means the stock price would have to go up 50 times for you to make your money back on an investment in Tesla.

Lot of bots trying to shit on GME, someone's worried lol
It’s not about who they were, it’s about what the company is going to be. You think Amazon got where it is because it stuck to selling books only? Just wait and see.
We like video games okay. If there was a choice between eating food or okay games we would pick games 100% of the times.
How on earth $fdx is trading so cheap. I bought after their earnings and shit struggles to stay up even 1%
How’s it any different then Tesla’s market cap being valued more than all the American auto makers combined?
$100k gang checking in. Too bad if I sold I couldn’t afford shit lol
Days to expiration. 1 DTE just means expiring in 1 day.
There are better plays in the market. I too made money with GME but now it's just a pump and dump scheme. Move the money to tech companies and make more from it.

GME. Shorts never covered, SEC confirmed in their report yesterday.
I miss the pandemic. I was up over 600% then.
Then you need to try for yourself. Just a few benchmarks (excluded Octane 2.0 as that's one made by Google):

\- JetStream 2 (higher is better): 146.055 on Chromium 94 vs 83.847 on Firefox 93;

\- Kraken (by Mozilla, lower is better): 770.7ms on Chromium 94 vs 1079.2ms on Firefox 93.

But if you're used to the sluggishness of Firefox in Javascript heavy websites, you obviously won't notice it until you experience a faster browser.

Maybe someday people will stop buying PLTR 30c’s two weeks or less out from expiry. Karp and his handlers are laughing their asses off.
So my question is strengthened, can Zillow afford it?
Prints
The house I bought last November is up $40k 🤷‍♂️
You don’t get a permit on a preexisting home. Buyers are still paying out the ass on current homes and no new homes are being built.
I guess the question is to short or not??
Anyone going in on BITO today?
Remember Cathie got rid of it around $16
The opposite. Prices will go up until building houses is as profitable as before inflation fucked up prices.
Took a look at the ape subreddit and I am genuinely concerned that many people buy in to that shit. In what world is a resale video game company gonna be worth more than any company in history?

Waiting to see what happens with BITO today, MARA and RIOT up pre market tho
Besides your conservative loss numbers due to avg price like another user stated,  you are assuming it can sell them.  Zillow undercuts the normal commission standard for realtors.  But given an opportunity, most realtors will not show a zillow house unless it's absolutely the only thing on the market for their client.  Odds are you need to increase that loss percentage another few points.

I don’t think stocks will keep going up after tapering starts, at least not at the same rate, but there’s no reason to believe there’s going to be any type of large correction. 

I’m not saying you’re wrong that EVENTUALLY there will be a crash, as obviously stocks can’t just go up, but holding onto cash until that happens while inflation is rampant while also not knowing when it’s going to happen just doesn’t make sense to me. If you can prove me wrong and perfectly time the market (twice in a row), then more power to you and I hope you enjoy your gains.
Zillow has 3800 houses.
They’re selling every house at a loss. Let’s say 10% and average house is 250k.
That’s 25k x 3800= $95m loss.

Can Zillow afford a $95m loss?

I am confused, why would you pray for higher taxes?
Def thought today would be red after 4 straight green days.  Curious how it ends up.
The report literally said they did.

Look at Figure 5 &amp; Figure 6

In figure 6, those are 30 minute bars, so even though the short seller buy volume looks tiny compared to the total buy volume (which was huge) you have to add up those bars across the entire day to look at the total number of shares closed during that time.

The report concluded that the stock run-ups were primary caused by buy volume not short sellers being squeezed but it clearly shows the shorts closed their positions.

I know most people aren't going to actually read the whole report but rely on "summaries" provided by others.   If you have real money in the game you owe it to yourself to take the time and read the whole thing.

Amc and gme 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍🦍🦍😍😍😍😍😍😘
after hours
Not ITM
thinkin about buyin up JNJ on open

anyone else doin the same?
Oh and that’s all cash at 575k, no inspection.
You don't think everyone....everyone at CNBC, MSNBC, Fox, CNN, every single one of them is not a corporate bootlicker?

Everyone.
Good morning to everyone except the bears
Dump them all and credit spread that TSLA
If it does I’m adding more 

showing retard strength or just one hell of a relief rally?
PM, AH, futures, are all fake and gay. only regular market hours are straight and real.
Trust the bot
Housing starts fall, SELL TSLA!! 👺

The bear mind can't be explained. No wonder they just lose money
or
This bull wont stop. If you stay in it’s way it will just run u over
check yesterdays crude oil chart for reference
It’s not a bubble. Leverage and speculation isn’t what drove it up
Just need to 10x my net worth!
and then you don't receive a bid below 575,000
I sometimes wonder about all the people who didn't hold through that little dip we just had and instead panic sold. And I think ... where are they now?
What's the word?
Stop buying Uranium etfs. These companies all carry massive debt and take forever to scale up, which offsets gains when uranium prices moon. Buy physical uranium only. 

&amp;#x200B;

Position: 64kg 99.7% pure yellowcake uranium, stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags under my bed.
Dump
Or hold at open
Visual mod is a pimp. Zjz is a 🌈 pimp
Sell. Sell one hour before close.  IV crush.
Yeah, a bit aggressive, but considering it’s only Tuesday and all the U stocks are catching a bid premarket, you might actually make it (depending on what your premium was)
Remember when the entire market shit their pants because a chinese developer? Bears still in shambles
No, jumped off $48 with higher lows. Major bull flag.
MERCK waking up.  $90 by December 1
have a gun to borrow?
Look at the futures charts. Kinda looks like somebody found out an hour early, sold the rumour and then had a little nibble at the news an hour later. Didn’t even bother trying to hide it either.
Your good
Housing Market bubble about to pop, Zillow knew about it.
Puts. Juicy juicy puts.
I’ve not been able to get them open yet but the guy who sold them to me for $19 each said they have moon tickets in them. He seemed pretty trustworthy
$TSLA or GTFO.
Definitely gonna need it latee
Just had two +50% days in a row. Couldn't help but give in 1.5^365 into google, it's tradition at this point.
but Uranium does not love you back,
BABA is gonna moon today
Buy high, sell low, this is the way
SPY to 500.
Looks like holding my AAPL calls overnight so far was a good idea. We shall see
Starter homes starting at 500k
But time for a 💩
ITM
Sofi dip at open or no ? Vote
Sell
Buy better stonks.
Do they hold a lot of stuff?
RIP housing market.
If you only have $100 then assuming SPY stays green all day I'd put around half of it into a 1dte put at close and save the other half to try again at a better price if you're wrong. If it's $100 for today and you have more for tomorrow similar deal except maybe save more than half for the possible second try
If you’re wrong you’ll lose half your money if you’re right you’ll gain 20%
[deleted]
VisualMod coming in with the facts
2x spy 10/20 450c
Love it for you, hate it for me. I've been wanting to ditch my other bags and load up on SOFI since it was in the 13's, but I've instead found myself averaging down on the worst stock of all time (WISH) when I could've made all of that money back by now with a company I actually believe in. Sucks so much dogg.
Yes. As of tradition
Hey you, yeah you. Remember to Patreon wsbsynth if you are using it
Maybe if there was a saving grace, like a FDA letter or something, but straight up failing a phase 2 trial vs. placebo… no thanks
Yeah I believe she has a personal agenda against my portfolio.

Her only good picks were TSLA and ROKU.
All 10/22 calls. SPY $449 25 contracts, AAPL $148 50 contracts and TSLA $890 1 contract. How am I looking?!
Inflated stocks can depreciate more than the USD
&gt;Dear diary: 

I sold the bottom again😞. Not the absolute bottom, but I was pretty damn close…
Red year confirmed.
Well then most stocks drop after ER
Had an extra cup of coffee this morning. Need a BBRRRRRRRR badly this morning for these weeklies 🍇 🚀
An unprecedented amount of QE will do that.
i just put 50k in riot tbh
Animal hold
I know, it’s bullish for the stock long term, but short term, we’re gonna see $46 unfortunately, I’ll be loading up tho 👀
then dont buy it lol.
Company invests pre inflation dollars into growth. Inflation boosts price of product or service. 🚀🚀🚀
Red
Thought I was a genius with URA 10/22 $31c. Most likely gonna be worthless. Oh well I'll just put more cash in my casino account
Who is thinking TSLA will be a "sell the news" event and then will recover in a week or two?
Bro I am all cash. I have over 800k sitting there. I am pissed this market won’t die.
Omg VM is giving out play advices!!
You’re an animal
Where?
Fund your IRA.
Man it sucks being poor with all these dildos everywhere. Anyone got a $100 play today?
$TNA $Z $PYPL $ATVI some of my recent CSPs.
No they have a merger coming. Deadline today.
I'm a gambler, God dammit
Just do ATM, or $1 OTM with a longer expiration if you don't want to risk as much but are still confident. If you wanna play with fire go $5 ITM, delta gets big fast.
Sell
460
500
Can someone with a kid send an extra pacifier over to /u/RichFelon, he must have lost his this morning.
781 resistance idk if we’ll get it
Benchmarks started saying differently when Firefox updated their backend with the new quantum stuff, and my experience agrees with those. Firefox has been known to be faster than Chrome since those changes. I switched then simply for the speed upgrade because I felt it so readily. Not sure why your experience is so different.
&gt; Yes.
Apple, Microsoft and Google didn't have Elon
whats spy eow looking like
So i SHOULDN’T have bought weekly apple puts yesterday? Ok cool, just checking. At least it was only a couple hundred bucks
Ewww, yeah, too close to the current price. I learned my lesson about that hard when I had sold $150s in March and got fucked and $200s in May for June.
CCJ still a buy?
THOR saw a nice 20% gain after earnings. I’m hoping to see WGO follow suit. Fingers crossed
$450 incoming, there’s no way
Manifest the hopium
I’m usually kinda bearish but you gotta be dumb or insane to think SPY is gonna come down big this week. My 446 calls are gonna print 💰
just a matter of time
And then the uptrend continues as you scramble to to sell the put and buy more calls to offset the loss of your put.
Hold these spy calls till Friday like the animal I am or sell for profit
Wrong answer!!!! Become cultured and come back
The report literally said they didn’t ??
Tesla calls or puts at open?
NKLA was a thing not that long ago.
All my homies hate the 10 yr yield
Sold some SPY 454 calls for 11/10 last week, not feeling great about it now.
So like, 1,000$ worth of your “life savings”
The fomo must be strong
I just bought some cheap options that expire next month. If it’s going to follow the trend it should pop soon, but I’ll just ride these contracts till they expire
I love Uranium
They could put it in an alleyway holding onto its ankles and looking over its shoulder
🤨
Somebody gotta cash in on their  futures trades
probably cause we aren’t losing money out the ass like WISH and SDC holders
Same. Except mine were 1/21/22. Still had plenty if time. They went red for a couple days so when they went green i sold em.

Fucking options profit calculator made it seem like a moonshot to make any money off them
Other CCP officials are taking their turn. Baba is having a rest while they wait for the viagra to kick in
shit, nows the time to buy![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)
At the Money is always a good choice but nothing gets you off like a 1% OTM going up 1,800% overnight
that bear flag on the 4hr says otherwise
Something smells fishy
I hope so.  This month has been very good to me so far.  If the crude prices would drop like they normally do this time of year, I should be set to show a profit by the end of the year - assuming I don't do anything stupid.
Everyone needs his mindset on corporate taxes.
Will today open green and close red?
Cathie has been getting destroyed this year. Her buys have been so bad it almost seems intentional
This market will buy anything and everything
Some random finance bro who works for some hedge fund or the SEC or some shit is going to get shot by a man in a Harambe costume
There is always a leak before. I been trading tsla for 2 years. they always leak early. supposed to be after Wednesday close.

But watch the early whispers.
You’ll still wake up at 630 but you’ll have to wait till 1230 instead

Edit: I am a confused retard
You're such a cute and a good bot, VisualMod.
Nope, it isn't. Benchmarks on Phoronix have been saying otherwise for years until now. My experience also on Reddit &amp; Tradingview says otherwise (scrolling is hell on Reddit and other Javascript heavy websites when using Firefox). Firefox has been known to be slower than Chrome. Its only advantage is privacy &amp; the fact that it doesn't come with Google spyware integrated with it, but as I said, one could get the same privacy features using Chromium + a few add-ons &amp; disabling some Google features.
VisualMod confirmed smarter then 90% of WSB
Fuck you bears, go back to sleep ho.
No it wouldnt lmao, their a massive scam
SOFI still moving up 📈📈📈
I’ve got some nice bags. I encourage others to purchase the same kind.
just don't
So, for how long and to which price target is RIOT going to travel?
WGO is such a great stock with awesome financials but it vomits all over itself after every good ER because people are always trying to call the end of the RV boom
Those are the moments meant to be experienced
Still 25% down in ARKG.

Disappointed in you, Cathy.
Looks like the housing starts data leaked about an hour early. Interesting
Waxing poetic
QE is ending. The point of QE is to raise asset prices. How do people think asset prices will retain their value as QE stops? I didn’t say 50 percent. And people knew about Covid since December. Everyone assumed it was nothing and said stocks only go up.
Nuclear finna rip today
Yes
Ok getting close. TIME TO PUTS THE FK OUT OF SPY
Looks like I’m never going to Canada LOL. I’m American so it’s all good, I don’t live in Cali or anything like that. I’m German (American) so if I need to go to Germany that would be the only time I do it, if it’s mandated. But that’s not in the foreseeable future.
I ain’t workin here no mo
Yeah it sucks homie, but then I would be up at 3AM
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
AH
For the CONGREGATION!
hookers and coke.

what left spy calls.
Made bet that TSLA would go up to 900, it expires in 2 days. Im not getting banned.
Now that you mention it that would be pretty cool to have a bear statue facing off against the bull
I mean yeah, but the global pandemic that shut down most of developed world is to blame for the “until we didn’t” part. Unless something similarly unprecedented acts as a catalyst, there’s no reason (in my opinion) to believe we’ll see another 50% crash.
Ok I'll buy into COIN but still suspicious of your option play and exp date, good sir
&gt; I remember when yesterday started off red. I also remember when it ended up green.
SPY gapped up again??

Bears... I'm sorry.
DKNG gonna rawdog send $60 so hard
Can’t wait for stocks to crash as the money printer is turned off. Your calls will be fucked
Remember when yesterday started off red? LOL
Does TSLA report before of after hours tomorrow?
Will BB ever, ever be worth another punt. Sold out, but I can’t help but think it must happen at some point. When is the patent reveal ?
It’s cheap.. but I do not want to be holding the bags for that stock, ever again.
Use real time, none of that 1675436 bullshit
Xi got his nut so BABA to $200 while he refracts
Maybe people will pump it after market open, lol
Buy a home so you can so you can borrow against it and get more of the depreciating asset or sell it for a profit and get more of the depreciating asset .
Well, because COIN will crush the ER, and then we have peak of four year cycle coming up in a few weeks. Check price history, those calls have moved 5x in last couple of weeks.
Oof glad I held calls
In retrospect, buying options on MARA for EOY was such easy money based on past history with bitcorn in bullruns in Q4.... too bad I didn't buy any. fuck.
Lmao 🐻🤡
Still riding whats left of FB volatility until something opens up in SPY or QQQ.
I'd DCA into $TSLA leaps if you're unsure about Wednesday's ER (DCA will make it so that you aren't that sensitive to a single day dip/rip in the long run).

Actually, Israeli study came out not long ago about the efficacy of the vaccine compared to natural immunity. The convulsion was the the vaccine is good short term, but is not known the effectiveness long term. People that gained a natural immunity actually were the most efficient at repelling the virus. The study does say they are not recommending people not get the vaccine because they want natural immunity but that natural immunity will provide for a more clear, safer, and effective option. Obviously you’re not at the dictation of when, but if you survive then your natural immunity will be stronger than what the vaccine does.

And we made ATHs in February 2020 until we didn’t. I sold in January and rebought in April. I believe this can be timed

It's actually quite remarkable just how fast Tesla is approaching the $1t marketcap valuation. It took Apple, Microsoft and Google over 2 decades.

Tesla did it in basically half that time.
Worth 💩
We’ve been making new ATHs basically every week for the past year. It might be the top, or we might rally another 20%.

What browser do you like?
Its hilarious that a report that concluded that the large short-sellers did close their positions in Jan is being used by apes to draw the opposite conclusion.

Its proof that no matter what evidence is provided, they will continue believe that "the shorts never covered"
At least I don’t work in fucking towing in fucking Texas you pathetic piece of shit
There's more than you'd think but yeah the repression is heavy there. Chicks would have found more excuses to take their titties out if they were going through this irl and the creators of the show understood humanity incredibly well on a deep and scientifically based level, sexuality is like the one thing they weren't accurate on imro. It's interesting that their culture could have enough sexual repression to make people with such a deep understanding of humanity remain limited in their understanding of that area
good luck timing that shit, hope you don't lose 80k to inflation sitting on your hands
AVIR calls worth?
If only there was some place to talk crypto, GTFOH
I’d wait 1 minute before it expires to sell . Spy should be at 455 by Friday
Same. My hope is the market crashes, as it should. I can then deploy this cash and buy the dip.
Figure out what broker will hire you. You have to have them register you, cant just sign up for it. Prepare to work the regular investor services role for a few months unless you really impress someone, but you’ll still get the “broker” role fairly fast.

Get to the “trader” desk ASAP or on a chat team that does trades, the regular service role blows and is a psychological drag when you’re dealing with people calling in about stupid shit that they could just read on the websites, but would rather waste a human being’s time
Doesnt the fact that the SEC said GME was the only stonk in January with SI more than 100% make the cinema stock a hoax?

Just tried Firefox years after I gave up on it because it was extremely slow back then, and it turns out it's still a sluggish piece of shit even on an i9 CPU &amp; RTX 2070 GPU. Went back to Chromium, much much faster.

Market cheat codes do exist though. Open your broker and type in TSLA and buy. Come back tomorrow and your account is always up.

If it makes you feel better, in 2020 I sold some TSLA calls for about $39,000 that would have been worth $447,000 only 8 days later. I deserved it for breaching protocol and buying calls with that much time left on them.
There’s a chapter of the Tom Clancy novel Rainbow Six where a group of terrorists invade the home of a billionaire and hold him prisoner.

Through dumb luck, I bought 1,500 SOFI @ $15.05 in mid-August. I just sold 10x 11/26 $25C. I'd be pretty surprised if it got that high that soon, but if it does and they called away, that's cool with me.
I think $338 per share or less is still a good point to buy with earnings coming up and worst case for long term most analysts have the fair value over $400

Damn dat kinda green
I swing both sides ;) if there’s a down trend, I’m holding puts. Uptrend, I’m holding calls. So I came out well through all this. Play the trends is basically all you gotta do.
A political thing? If you can’t see economic conditions worsening then I can’t help you. I am hoping the BBB passes as higher corporate taxes will stop as many stock buybacks and kill this bull market. Irrational exuberance is not healthy. But let’s go Brandon.

Why would anyone plan to buy puts on TSLA at open when they can buy them at tomorrow's Close
Erm I’m currently disproving this theory and will soon be showering.
LOL why Facebook losers then

Nice. I’ve had strong conviction on WMT for a long time. Glad to see the big boys are coming around.
How you got $140 left in a market like this!? Market is begging you to take its money just yesterday on one spy call with 140 bucks you could have pulled 80$ profit.
These SPY Options are like cocaine, can't get enough...
I read what contracts here and thought “ehhh that ain’t too bad” then I saw Friday Expiration and remembered I’m on WSB
Does anyone feel kinda bad for the 🐻 s?
TSLA puts are the play for earnings. With the stock moving nearly 50% since the last earnings and the majority of that in this recent parabolic run up it would need a huge beat and raised guidance to continue its movement. EPS expectations from the street are extremely high so even a meet or partial beat would likely get sold off. Picking up some $900P contracts for next week on any pre earnings mania.

RIP AVIR gang, enjoy a few more minutes of being able to talk about it here before it is forever banned for having too small of a market cap.
Lol someone just got assigned on a lot of TSLA contracts
He got stoned and forgot
Yeah, I just want to buy more calls because a delay in movement of funds made me miss the bottom of the dip. And the couple times I've traded puts they're short term while the calls are long term so then it's an even stronger feeling of wanting to see my own calls go down
I didn’t buy puts ? Lol 🤣
Yes.

800k in cash. No puts. No shorts. Just sick of seeing this go up everyday. Economic conditions are horrible

I still have 2. Sold 2 yesterday for a tendie. Guess I shoulda held. Like with the other calls I sold yesterday. Oh well. Profits are profits. I was burned last month on various calls especially moderna so I'm a little scared to not just take profits when I have them
Stuck in the "sPy Is A pUmP aNd DuMp" stage of grieving for your puts, I see.

Agreed, but until it’s retard strength dies down, I’m going to keep making money hopping in and out with calls.

Alright Tesla let’s see 900 today so my way otm calls can print

I'm playing NFLX earnings. This season is running hot! I'm already locked in for aapl $150 for next week, looking at AMZN as well

BABA is going to look like such an obvious play in hindsight. China was never going to let them fail.
Nah it's a decent play at these prices. It was overvalued last year/early this year, but 25/share is a good place to start averaging in for their eventually rally after supply chain issues are sorted out.

You shorted the memes at the bottom?
Sold my 401k which was entirely SPY at 435. Had to do this to move it to a different brokerage which would let me buy SPXL which took 1 day. But since then we’ve only had huge rallies and I thought oh let me wait for a red day. Now we’re approaching 450 and I just missed this whole rally lol.

I remember those that did not play $TSLA, yet felt the need to shit on it daily and do everything they could to just try and convince everyone to not play it. Like it was their life calling for some reason. They would say Enron Musk, Ass Burger, and on and on.  Unrelenting vitriol.

Far from overbought on the 1 day
Cursed but on point
Is there any bears left lol???
Need more to join force on SPCE lets blast to 22
I keep feeling bearish even though I keep holding calls. Every time SPY goes up it stresses me out and disappoints me, every time it goes down I'm excited. It feels exactly like if I was holding puts the past 2 weeks except I've only traded puts like twice in that time while my portfolio has been mostly calls the whole time

Student loan repayments will be back on soon so refinancing origination with SoFI will increase. Also rates going up is good for banks. Did the warrant redemption already happen? I haven’t really been following SoFI a lot recently but that event causes dilution which would bring the price down. Idk if that already happened though

Romantic decisions are very very often decided by things which seem inconsequential, things which at first we tolerated or even found charming, but after a short while we find insufferable, like how at first an ugly laugh is endearing, but then suddenly it becomes disgusting. Those small things really add up, and can weigh down many relationships that on paper make a ton of sense,and conversely can incomprehensibly keep a relationship going despite it’s objectively doomed status. Human beings in love aren’t just irrational, they are almost anti-rational.

DKNG $56/$57C 10/29.

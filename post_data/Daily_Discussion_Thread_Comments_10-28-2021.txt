Sofi has to be even more boring than pltr
It’s done bombing bro…it’s about to rip
DIS isn't looking so hot right now. The bottom of the channel is strong, but...I don't know. It's looking like a right shoulder is forming lately.
Man, idk how you’re not blown away by the index. Clearly the future. Can’t overstate it enough.
Feds. They’re being investigated for some shenanigans. Good news is that it’s still V

When to buy calls on V? Probably try some end of day tomorrow and see how much I lose next week. Fckr just won't stop falling.
Thank you, SPY powerhour green dildo! I thought I was going to have to eat those 1DTE SPY calls. made it out alive for 10% profit
Pray for AAPL

SPY 428 to almost 460 in a month lmao
Well, at least inversing myself at bell yesterday by buying SPY calls instead of my gut telling me to get puts paid off this time.

Even though I'm up a bunch today, I still somehow feel like I lost...
FB, V, MA. Not buying only because tomorrow is 29th. The default day
My thoughts exactly

That’s me with Robinhood in my pocket at Caesar’s
You want 11 million of us to buy an ETF?
Well boys, no matter what, when the trading day is done, whether you were gay or a faggot, you’re all kings in my book. Well done, all.

What if announce stock split and pay increase to the warehouse workers?

Bi-polar AF
Have you considered index funds or crack cocaine
MVIS puts.
Now we’ll know if we get to 460 tomorrow, earnings frenzy.
As tradition
The account is free and you don't have to do anything else with it, right? I have an Xbox account, I don't see the issue.

Now linking it to your personal Facebook account is different, but that means you already have a personal fb account so you bought in once already.
Just bought 22 AAPL 155c exp 11/12 

Not very risky but I want the money baby
I’m getting tired of the ole losing money thing
When everything is green, you have so much to lose, when everything is red, its already gone.
One last fomo buy before close! Gimme a ticker
This market is heading towards a massive blowoff top
RIP 10/28 to 10/28
I prayyyy I’m down so much on my outs
Id be surprised if Amazon didn’t 🚀

Are we going to be calling it Metabook messenger from now on?
They will have to massively crush earnings for you to not be massively crushed by IV.

LCID going up for the close
I have 69 western digital puts. These things have to pay off, they haven’t been so please tell me what I’m missing.

hopefully AAPL goes nowhere after earnings
Remind me! 6 months
just opened a tesla call. mommy, I’m scared
Aw, don't be so hard on yourself, babe. You're someone to me. Also, my target were hit.
Good news to theta bros
Let's go TSLA . 1100 ain't a joke
🦎
Alright I’ve seen it enough times I have to clear up some ignorance 

Why did HOOD have confetti on their app when you bought shit?

The NYSE often drops Confetti when new companies ring the bells at the goddamn opening and closing.

How many of you haven’t watched the opening and closing bell? I watch it every damn day
Apparently it was a short lived red-pill experience.

&amp;#x200B;

SPY found its blue pill again.

&amp;#x200B;

This reminds me of Monday's close.
SLY

only bought the Index the rest came as a gift.
Lol catalyst at all?
Lets go big fella!
Rip my spx poots
lol that green bar
Spy 0dte puts for tomorrow after today’s run up?
Close at 460 plz
Yeah even I think that’s a dumb idea and I have donkey brains
This earnings call is going to prove no one gives a fuck about inflation.

All these keeping up with the jones's morons will continue to yeet their paychecks into useless landfill filling shit from Amazon. When they get $15/hour burger flipping jobs they will just do it even harder. ER beat. Bullish
You would know
Fb moving like a penny stock
I am no one
It’ll be back. I’ve heard “bought the top of FB” every year for like 10 years lol
Tesla ripping?
Everybody excited for that IV Crush coming? Cause it's coming.
&gt; That's just it. You're not going to cash out because you don't have the money.
I barely escaped the NVDA crab walk with a profit. I'm going to wait 1 week before earnings to yolo in again
We will find out
OHHH SPY BABY IM GONNA 💦
Amzn to 4000 or 3200 ? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
i mean i expected meta to cool off but christ
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/abluga9876 (0/1) made a bet that AMD would go to 116.96409499999999 when it was 123.1201 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Why would I get out when I’m about to cash out? 😳😳
Are VRAR involved in the MetaVerse or something?
If it's record profits but everything tanks on ships and chips I'm going to rage quit and put it all in FanDuel.
Every call for F at every strike above 16 strike has a $16.82 BE for Friday. Won’t get above that price​
Fuck it Amazon 4000c 11/5 5x
Oh right, “otherwise it should drill ….”
And of course it moons when I finally decide to GTFO LOL

have fun fuckers. See you next week
SPY chill 😭
Holy shit everything is greeeeeen. Why am I more scared than ever.
Doing the same, they are so large, a huge brand name and have so much money they can throw around to solve crisis or need to change course on dumb decisions, that I'll always hold the line on the evil corporation that's been corrupting America's youth for almost a century.
This is more fun than watching Bowling for Dollars.
Mark Zuckerberg is 40 yet looks younger than me in my 20s
You bought 3 VR systems and don’t like VR, right. Totally believe you.
V probably just blew up every Boomers and Millennials retirement accounts
Voting rights.  Some idiots think they're worth something.
Imagine what would happen if all 11 million+ of you bought some META. 🤯
I need DIS and V to gap up 2% tomorrow
It's a top today but a dip for tommorow
GME is looking fucking bullish
Only reason I didn’t get one.
FB has left the chat. 📉
For cucks and nerds afraid to go outside and touch actual vagina, sure
I’m holding til tomorrow :/
At least one person cared (besides me), therefore your argument is invalid.
SU $30 within a month
Uhmmm…I will shave my balls if that prints
Please stop spam pumping.  Thx
Straddle for guaranteed sideways
I'm holding it at least till they split the stock
Split and beat please
People saying some dumb shit in here during the last ten minutes. Go short AAPL at your own fucking peril
MM trying to pin FB down
Uber scrapped their whole autonomous vehicle strategies after they killed some guy on a bike.

Tech earnings is over boys. Let see what will prop up this shit market for the weeks to come.
MVIS baby... here comes the BOOM!!!!

SHORTS GET OUT NOW!!!!
AMD $126 calls for 11/5
Fucking bull run right now let’s go $1110
Apple stock is the play of the hour
Funny story. I sold my oculus rift back in the day the second they announced that I needed an FB account to use it. I thought that was pretty gay.
I’m a dum dum
That’s what everybody’s said each earnings last year. If they announce a split it might happen, but I wouldn’t hold my breath.
HTZZ is doing well today. Earnings were good and people are talking about them now.
Or puts
When the markets closed you can go 👜 snatchin
Metaverse is the new universe.

FB decided their brand was too damaged to continue. Abandon ship

Folks: one last minute play I did with FDs. WDC reports earnings AH. It usually impacts MU but straddles are cheap and not pricing in a big move in MU. So I got straddles on MU. Did the same last week with FB when SNAP was reporting
More like 🌈🐻🤑
(Looks at Q2 earnings SP activity) Bruh...
OCGN $13 calls for next week. Is my guess but what do I know

Who got the lcid top? 38 here
Bought the dip and it keeps dipping…
HIMX vr/ar stock look at the other ones up 15-50%+!!!
Buying FB $320 calls for tomorrow, and yes I am retarded
I’m loaded with 36 $6c SDC BABY. I’ve got a sixth sense about these things
Agree but the probe is probably going to give us even better entry points
No.
I know you are absolutely wrong, but I hope you are right.
DIS, why do you have to be such a pain in the ass?
Need a 10 bagger. Quick. 1k left
Lol, I bet a few hours ago you were all like 😍🚀🚀😍
12 m lcid call? 40 strike? Wtf…
They deliver cars this weekend, I think its a safe bet till monday
Back down to -5% 🤡
This is the kind of bet that makes my butthole moist
Hold me I’m scared!
Xom up .32 and my deep itm calls are down .30. Wanted to sell before earning but whatever, will let it ride
Both parties like the bill. SPY uppies and uppies rest of week.
What does it look like
They have good investor information on their website. There are tons of reviews of their vehicles also and they are very positive.
They do if their is an offering accompanying it as per tesla
Used all my remaining gunpowder on more DIS calls, time to sit back and watch the show 🐭🚀
Got excited looking at a chart thinking SPY was dumping but it was just my portfolio's chart 🤡
I noticed that. It’s actually kind of crazy how angry she comes across.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
The flag forming on BB looks really nice.  I bought 40 11/12 $12c today.
&gt; I'm not sure if you're referring to Uber or Tesla, but I think that's a pretty good idea.
STOP DROPPING META
You are the reason why Cathie keeps buying HOOD
Seems like a good play
Cucked by zuck again 🤡
Ever? Those were Ubers plans too I just thought Tesla would beat them to it
Everything rally pass new year 🚀
Kid in class and I bond over stocks, he gets into this whole speech about TA and fundamentals and now I don't have the heart to tell him I just do whatever WSB tells me to do.

Alright using absolutely no research or any brain power except emotion I purchased a $215 Visa call expiring in a month I absolutely cannot wait to spend a month watching $350 go up in smoke. Self sabotage is a healthy form of coping.
X gon give it to you! Earnings after market close tonigjtt
Jacked to the tits with puts.
You could also use emojis if you make money, but you do you
V super cheap rn, buy the dip
Been waiting for that shit to recover

Stephanie Link is always angry for some reason
We’re at ATH hitting serious resistance and MMs still don’t want to take their profits before the most exposed earners post. Greedy fucks.
tsla calls here?
It seems changing your company name makes your stock go up...

Quick, SPY, call yourself something stupid.
15,000 SQUID
Sleep with one eye open tonight. Sentiment report on way.
Does affirm go up or down tomorrow
Whole markets a pump n dump now
They’ve already clarified none of the cars will have FSD or autopilot.

Hertz ceo was pretty adamant to clarify that in his interviews
CLF pt is $37 lol doubled down
DIS selloff fake and gay, 173 again tomorrow 
💎 🖐
Close
cost basis 207. pissed off but alive and well
thats meta disappointing
Mvis gonna drop like a turd
AFRM might save amzn
Don’t buy puts on AAPL lol
HIMX for vr/ar
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/Daybyhour69er** bet **HOOD** goes from **35.49** to **37.5** before **2021-10-29 15:49:35.576636-04:00**
Should've just called it SquidbookGame but you do you, Zuck
If by correction you mean AAPL and AMZN catching up to their earnings from February, then yes. AAPL 300, AMZN 5000 sounds about perfect.
Amazon losing steam, earnings leak
Tesla poots lol. Smart.
!banbet hood 37.5 1d
if u don’t buy this meta dip u hate money
I’ve been deep is the mouse since 2015. Nothing going to shake me. Mess with the rat, get the gat
Hold the line 💎 🙌
450 open tomorrow, don’t @ me
Pussy.
If LCID wants to close above $35 so bad then it should just do it and quit being a little bitch. Otherwise, it should drill. Punk ass electric car ass not Tesla ass cheap ass bitch.
Opened TSLA 1060/1050 put debit spreads for the drop tomorrow
thank u brother, the plan this morning was to sell before close and you kept me on the path
Repeat after me: AAPL👏🏼WILL👏🏼NOT👏🏼FALL👏🏼
My SPY prediction was [pretty close.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qh56sa/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_october_28_2021/hiamo4y?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) Still got time, but I don't think it'll hit.
Entering tesla calls for 11/5 exp
so is everyone essentially playing hot potato  to profit on the current market's retardation?
Honestly you should
I'm sorry. The person you have dialed cannot be reached right now, and their mailbox has not been set up yet. Goodbye.
My portfolio is like: Stonks go up? Lose money. Stonks go down? Lose money. Stonks go sideways? Believe it or not... Lose money.
Tomorrow gonna be either red or green as fuk after AMZN and AAPL earnings
MVIS earnings after bell
You really pumping this hard. How much you bag holding?
Any thought of buying magnite? A company doing same business as TTD, recently acquired another company, and making profit quarterly
Cozy in my bag

 DIS rattling the paper hands. No shaking these diamond hands, balls deep and not selling

But bro they make Lidar tech that is apparently 1000x better and for 1/1000 the cost as competitors. But auto just hasn’t caught on yet.

They also make some lens thing for Microsoft VR headsets that is apparently so valuable that they licensed the tech for peanuts
im a clown and im still waiting for a red day to buy in
Nobody fucking likes you SPY! *spits in SPY’s face*

We just hang out with you because you’re rich and highly liquid! Fucking loser! Now sit DOWN!
More uppies tomorrow or close SPY calls now?
I love QT.
For sure. Im a long term buy and hold guy but WSB acts like a great canary in a coal mine at times. I agree that some of the positions you see here make you scratch your head though.
Barely
Fuck FB and their bitch ass drop at the end of the day. I need this to hit 340 within 2 weeks
Was that bill passed?
34.16
Is Lucid a pump and dump? Or is there a real bull thesis that it can be the next tesla? If someone can point me to a good DD, that would be much appreciated
Advanced Money Destroyer strikes again
Medium AF
This. Didn’t that clown running the transportation department take 2 months off for this shit?
Welcome to last year.
A last minute selloff of companies reporting earnings? No way. No possible way anyone could see this coming. I am shook.
Run! FB Run!
Who drinks water like a duck.
This delusional market is pissing me the fuck off
Fisker is definitely the pump and dump
I'd be hard for weeks
You have a strike of 446?
AMD calls are the way
SPY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

458 eod 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
V holders alive?
Apple and Amazon gonna beat bigly and market rocket ride tomorrow.
AMZN doing an IV crush pre-earnings

That’s a good thing your ye call holders.
It's a holding stock tbh
keep dumping SPY so I can buy more calls at close
Ok, so what company has earnings tomorrow morning that may actually have a chance of moving a few dollars in a direction?

I need to repair my car and E-Trade gives instant option money when sold same day, so any ticket that has a chance of upside would be cool. Out of work two days now without my car.
So Meta is trying to create Ready Player One
[deleted]
For real. Also a weird business decision because Nabisco and Cadbury have a lot more brand equity I would think…
Aight time to drill.
Feel the same way. I put a small bet because everything looked really attractive with this stock. I'm watching the delivery numbers and their financial numbers in the future very closely. If I see more positive news and hitting or exceeding consistent financial targets I'll start dumping a lot more money in.
Apple puts rn…
Cucked by the Zuck
Tf is FB? I’m long Meta
Already loaded up on puts. That company is garbage.
Spy opens at 4500 lol
Same.  I'm banking on an overnight dip for tomorrow.
$DIS making me cry
I guess everyone is scared of missed reports dragging the market down and taking some profit now.
Just bolstered my DIS call position.. if you’re not buying up when it’s hovering around its 3M low after seeing what it’s done historically you’re going to miss the boat. Tendie town tomorrow 🚀🚀
FUCK I really want to short AAPL.
QT Gas stations pop up $.50 gal. tomorrow, others will follow. Fill up tonight, thank my source later.
Seems worth a small contribution
I’m high af
How do we know he is not still a virgin?
Exciting day watching that Tesla chart. Maybe tomorrow it'll pop
MVIS earnings play
Holy moly big tech is dropping hard
Last chance to get SPCE below $19.  (Bagholder checking in)
Well, they were out of Viagra, so....
They have no rights
Thanks, bud--that was a morale boost.
intel isnt going anywhere anytime soon
Investing? Intelligent risk management?
Can't believe LCID hasn't went back to 30
Holding onto my Amazon calls but I already know what's about to happen
bearish on AAPL
If AMZN calls print I will dress up as wonder woman and make a calendar for VisualMod as the hottest Amazonian.
There will be no winners here.  


APPL and AMZN will both come up short yet somehow SPY will still go up.  


Creepy Holo-Zuck will gently fuck us all to sleep as both Puts and Calls expire worthless.
Didn’t you know only bad news is bullish these days?
AMZN fueling
HIMX with fb news and good earnings
Up? ~ 460+
Down? ~ 454-
I feel like these are all exceptions to the rule. Stock splits usually are bearish. 

But hey amazon is up there with those companies so it’ll probably happen. I just don’t understand the mindset of diluting shareholders to be value added
Someone chose the red pill.
Lets finish the day strong. Come on
Oh god imagine if Amazon announced a 10-1 stock split today. It won’t happen, but still. I would cream my pants.
Agreed. 2024 tho
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Yup, and with fb’s vr/ar news should be good
The other day I was walking down the street in the Meta Verse and this skinny dude with shaved legs was walking an ugly ass pug he was wearing a name take that read cashflow. I don’t know why I’m telling y’all this. Carry On….
Yeah but it’s a bull market so it’s like going to a roulette table that’s 75% black and these goobers are going all in on red. You can gamble correctly but I respect any YOLO
I legitimately don't know. This market makes no sense, and I am not trying to understand it, just make money on it. 

Fisker has no hype, and thus isn't worth shit
IV crush sucks hard but mostly for weeklys if you’re really worried sell now and buy back in tomorrow or just let it ride if you feel strongly they will print.
Tsla 1100 calls 1dte
I don’t know what you just said at all.
I’d sell before close with Jan expiration. I got leaps and shares so I’m holding
Lucid is a pump and dump. Fisker is undervalued
MVIS is gonna fucking bomb....

When I clench my ass as my portfolio goes down it gives me chills
 COME ON QCOM LFG PUMP IT
This is what a guy selling calls would say
My guess is down 3.5% tonight
absolute free for all and its getting worse, i have a feeling this will go until it suddenly doesn't and liquidity is gone, eurodollar futes still think we got trouble at year end rebalance, again. i see this autistic shitfest going until december then some weird shit happens. ive also said the same thing 3 other times
I'm keeping my spreads going until tomorrow.50/50 I guess. fuck it and let it ride
Mondelez should just be called Nabisco or Cadbury. Kraft were cowards for not doing that

Fleet feet just recommended my wife by ON for her running shoes. All in on ONON now
Valuation is for lovers. But for real, it's hard to accept that Lucid is worth that much, especially given all the challenges they are facing.
So glad I sold my LCID at $24 back in July... 🤡  

&amp;#x200B;

(bought in pre merger, so still took profit. but still...)
This is why FB should have announced they’re making EVs or getting into sports betting. 2T market cap by EOD. You don’t even need a product, Zuck. Missed opportunity
oh you to
Meta kinda a sick name ngl

2T cap by 2023
I’m praying for a huge dump but god hates me so that won’t happen
Wanna rip higher, FB?
$215 call purchased
Last call and information sesh for $HIMX. Virtual reality/augmented reality stock and unknown. Should be going up due to facebook’s metaverse.

Will gap up tomorrow with all these vr/ar stocks up 15-50%+ right now.
any last minute lottos?

Been burned hard this week
Which stock? The hilarity depends on which stock
Spy price if amzn and aapl rip?
Are here any GME and AMC apes left?
RBLX just being RBLX
Sometimes I feel dirty scalping stocks
I don’t see an zuck kids running around
They have the same amount of cars on the road as Lucid…now tell me which company is at the top of a pump and dump and which one is undervalued..
AAPL, TSLA, and NVDA all ran

AMZN at 3.4k is steep for retail - this one would have the most impact
I feel like there should be a term for diamond handing while selling covered calls...diamond yoyo-ing? Nah, that's dumb--help me out here, guys.
I got bunch 1dte calls on apple 155 qcum 134 lucid 42 fb 330 amc 51

Don’t expect anything it’s all just yolo money that I can afford to burn. Up on some down on lucid air
Well, they start shipments, that’s something unlike other tsla wannabies
Once again amd has made me financially destitute thank you Dr. Su
3700c maybe
Facebook was already a stupid name.
aren't their earnings next week? they should crush it.
they don't have fractional voting rights, right?
I honestly can’t comprehend why the company I bought is down. It’s literally one of the only ones down. It’s nowhere near ath, and no news came out…
The $35 resistance is strong
[deleted]
because uber sucks
I never do this so far out the money yolo but hey why not if I lose I lose 310 bucks but if I win I live in infamy
And if it's a miss again?
Earnings after hours, so you'll probably lose either way it moves.
&gt; I have no idea.
Goddamn it - I was thinking of entering a long LCID position this AM. Wtf is wrong with me lmfao
One is meta one is microsoft
Are you fat or old?
[deleted]
I dunno. Kind of depends on the price action in to close, hopefully we get a big last minute dump. I sort of expect a selloff on SPY tomorrow but if we go up too much beforehand it won’t even matter if we do drop some. Ugh. Probably end up eating the loss
ITs gonna retrace to 250 easy!!!
Aapl moves whenever the fuck it wants lmao
who's holding AAPL calls through earnings? Debating whether to take profits on these Jan 22 446 calls. Does IV crush after earnings significantly affect options a couple months out?
[deleted]
Now it would
Be lovely if AMZN did a repeat of last earnings 😬😬😬😬 would be a nice dip to buy in a couple of weeks
Low AF
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
I am BULLISH on SPY
where is that second M coming from?
Mods please ban me for 2 weeks if Amazon or apple go up by 5%
Entering into end of November puts some time tomorrow.  Trillion dollar enterprises have all reported.  This is the best that SPY is going to do.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion if AAPL and AMZN earnings can't help SPY punch through $458 then nothing in the next month to two will help SPY break that ATH.
No go closer to the money
Meta is not a bad name, tbh. I’d take that shit 1000x before IBM’s Kyndryl or whatever French whorehouse the name “Mondelez” came from
How is lucid worth 56 billion. They have barley made a single car. This stock market is dumb as fuk.
Lmao
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
ITS BLACK FRIDAY AND HOLIDAY SEASON BOYS

AMAZON CALLS
Hell ye, yolo in
You won’t even have a billion one billionanth of a billion.
Pretty sure my hand print is burnt into the bags I've been holding for the last year.
Holding $HIMX the rest of the week. Gonna be a big player now that metaverse has given VR/AR stock a lot of visibility.
Is that Fisker? Have they even sold a single car that wasn't garbage?
No
Since when have stock splits become bullish for companies?

When did this mindset take over?
Chance of lucid opening at 45 tomorrow?
*Dave Chapelle dislikes this comment*
Most favorite part of my day is coming up. Have to decide between selling my calls for a big gain or holding them until tomorrow and potentially taking an even bigger gain. Hmmm
will we see a meta continuation tomorrow? or will they be crushed by apples inevitable shit earnings?
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/SeanSeanSean94 (0/1) made a bet that SOFI would go to 23.0 when it was 19.5285 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
If the money you’ll get by sellling now is insignificant let it ride
In 3100p 10/29.
I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL
the tragedy of dyslexia
Bruh 😂 could make bank
Beat earning, lower guidance
Why is DT taking off?
amzn 4000c for 10/29 worth it?
&gt; The average lifespan of a butterfly is about 4 months.
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/quarantrader** bet **SBUX** goes from **112.72** to **117.0** before **2021-10-30 15:40:23.663228-04:00**
webull commenters are some of the pissiest pathetic cheerleaders I’ve ever seen on the internets.
I love how Uber has gotten the short end of the stick for this mega pump deal between Tesla Cvna and hertz
Oh fuck F is so dead lol it is not holding todays gains very well at all
If by hard you mean shitting my pants with puts then yes I have a raging meat stick
Eating well tonigh thanks daddy Lizard
Same here. Might just take the loss today and not risk it tomorrow. Hbu?
!banbet SBUX $117 2d
Fuck it I bought 10 ‼️‼️‼️😂😂😂
Oh God! I should have waited before selling my SNAP calls for a $950 loss (which could have been only a $200 loss  if I waited) before putting that money into TSLA puts 😑😑😑😑
They do power quite a bunch of bigly apps and companies however there are already viable alternative options that companies can rather easily switch to (in the grand scheme of things, would have to tweak backend code but
Not much). 


I think they’re
Overvalued but I haven’t looked at numbers
Or anything so don’t listen to me
Eh, whats a loss in the grand scheme of things, eh?
That's what I'm doing, holding a few puts to hedge tho
Talk me out of MVIS puts!!
SPY about to Fly

And I mean fly

Going in bigly on MVRS Dec 1.
https://handwiki.org/wiki/Everything2
Made decent tendies. I can finally go to my first gay festival tomorrow 💃
So no one expect AMZN to miss earnings again? Last gap down was 7%
Are you retarded and dyslexic?  Brutal combination
Least favorite part of my day is coming up. Have to decide between selling my puts for a big loss or holding them until tomorrow and potentially taking a worse loss. Hmmm
Truly an amazing power hour to cap off the day
3 gonna buy 1 more after spy runs up EOD
Jassy will announce the split and eviscerate puts.

Bezos is mad Elon is richer.
$154?
Bought some X calls. ER afterhours. Should go up similar to CLF.
Also, hope you read the investor information on their website. I'm watching their financial targets and delivery numbers like a hawk for this stock. This stock has tons of upside though and even though a ton of DDs here are crap, the one's on LCID made good points and convinced me to buy in. Hope both of us make a ton of money on this one.
DIS is the next play
Fuck it. Took some 11/5 fb 325 c
$HIMX and zuckerberg
How is it retarded if I’m covered from downside Lmaoo I’m just adding more TSLA in my position
I have an oculus which I use daily. But can comfortably say it’s a great tool for a VR porn experience, but outside of that, I have no desire to wear a headset for long periods at a time.

not on this planet when did Apple ever move like that?
FAANG is now MAGMA
Just hit 458, why is this so hard?

Edit.  THERE, YOU DID IT
&gt; I think it could go to $153.
Bust through 324 and we run
How
Much is a bill board advertisement in the Meta Verse? They’re like $15,000 a month in the Uni verse
Time to play MVIS earnings lol
i have a fear boner, have a january 160c thats finally in the green...i just feel it in my plums like we have earnings either in line or a beat and dump, apple just doesnt seem to have that jazz any more

I know if I sell it's on like 2018 meme status donkey kong, $175 EOW
I don’t want Amazon to split, I don’t like playing with poors
What do you think it could actually go to? 153?
Oof
Missed the LCID ride up but am enjoying the ride down with my lonely, single put.
They haven't issued guidance last few quarters
At em? Up and at em? The Simpson’s?
Facts bro, could make 6 mil here
MVIS PUTS GETTEM WHILE THEY'RE HOTTTT!!!!
Screenshotted
Zuck doesn’t give a fuck
eBay nov 14 calls looks like a solid play
FSR can 12X from here and still have a lower evaluation than Lucid. FSR has a shitload more room to run
Can the Lucid cars go uphill though?
There's no better feeling than the feeling when one of your stock is mooning for no reason whatsoever
Yeah sure, these big time options traders are getting their info from Discord groups https://imgur.com/a/JTkvos4

I assure you that it is you who is retarded. Also earnings out in 30 min and Facebook AR speculation. Not that hard
Lol
Breakeven on my AMZN bags from last earnings because I averaged down.

Riding for earnings.
Badon is going to tax billionaire, f* that because I am going to be one of them through trading
AMZN calls for earnings yay or nay
That’s bullshit
You got calls?
Negative GDP is pretty much the meat and potatoes declaration of a recession.
N is better not disappoint today!
I think the FB lead is widening. Don't see any serious competitor.

*Looking at you MVIS* 👀
Fuck you ICLN. Now you decide to move…
[deleted]
Every VR and AR stock is up because of metaverse. Zucks loves it.

$HIMX supplies it. Read their business description. All AR and VR shit. 

#ZUCK GIVES THE BUCKS
We crash or get rich no in between ‼️😂😂
🥳
Life goals.  Im jelly
Anyone else notice that AMZN never closed that gap from 3600 to 3300 from July? 3600+ tomorrow at open
Not a bad decision if you're long term and not planning on making money on speculation prices. I personally think the price will dip below it's current price within a couple weeks and will be cheaper. I can see it go back down to $25. But I've been completely wrong about EV stock predictions. I sold my TSLA stocks at $800 months ago thinking it wouldn't break it again for a long time, TSLA just broke $1000 so I was wrong again on prediction. EV stocks are so hard to predict exactly, but they seem to just go up and up because of mandates and popularity among people buying stock.
Hey retard, meta backwards is at em, better luck next time
If AMZN calls print I will dress up as wonder woman the hottest Amazonian
If you’re selling TSLA options it’s basically just retard again.  Theta gang usually doesn’t sell parabolic, bipolar stocks
This market is retarded.

Loaded up on SPY, QQ PUTS.

I may be more retarded
Today made it pretty clear that if Zuck weren’t a billionaire, he’d still be a virgin
Well my fucking spy calls would be itm if I coulda woulda shoulda
Does anyone know a good site for options quotes after hours?
RKLB leaps keeping my account almost green. 

Time to gamble on microcaps!
AMZN puts 🤑
I got a flair on WSB. My life is complete.
TWLO 17% drop - BTFD or failing knife ?
Wait until you hear about the "Honey"
Guarantee earnings will be abysmal as per usual for mvis
they're very helpful and i recommend reading up on it a bit, helps demystify 

delta = $ of option movement per $1 in stock price movement. Your contract worth $X.XX with a delta of $.28 means that for one dollar up, the option is now $x.28 

Theta is, to generalize, how much your contract loses per day if nothing else changes. It gets worse the closer you are to expiry. 

If you've ever played with an OTM short dated option, you'll know what i'm talking about. Stock goes down, option goes down. Stock goes back up...option doesn't quite go back up as much. This is due in part to the clock running out (also implied volatility...aka the chance that a rapid nutso chaos movement can happen) 

That was a lot, but like I said, really important to help have at least some plan of attack. Delta = what stock movement does to your option. Theta = daily clock ticking cost
omg it does
Bruh. People don't come here for smart and steady profits. These are gambling degenerates who are looking for the next big bag.
You buy ODTE options and lose all of your money. 

I buy a year’s supply of Apple’s cleaning cloth to use as toilet paper. 

We are not the same.

You might want to look into EMOTF 👀💸🙏🏽
Yeah, stop trying to 5x. If you 2x every day 5 times in a row its 32x.
Buy granola instead. It's tastier.

Correction just happened you dumbass
&gt; The best thing to do is go back in time and sell them before they went up.
[deleted]
Search up any VR/AR stock. They are up 15-50%+ right now.

Then look up $HIMX who literally hve VR and AR in their business description.

If you havent gotten in on HIMX you got a chance
Did I just get Bull trapped?
Zuck-fk’s Ego...Meta spells “at me “ backwards.
Tesla fkn loves $1070 it’s driving me bonkers
damn, spy really wants to go up and it really wants to go down lol
What y’all think sell my tsla calls before close? Or be a retard and hold. No they don’t expire tomorrow
He’ll give u 330 by close
Does GDP determine recession?
Are we selling these bloody apple stocks then or what
Possible probe. Looks scary, so decent buying opportunity
lol yea if you bought the dip perfectly
It is time for AAPL
V and MA gonna rip next week.
LCID wants to close above 35
If you had puts at all then just put up your money and don’t option trade
He’s gonna diamond hand that shit to 0
Guidance gonna be decent or great you think?

So meta.

Who else is hard for AAPL earnings?
Luv is kill

Who’s the obvious vr winner here?
He’s right
&gt; The term "paternity leave" is not found in the dictionary.
4300 10/29
So what happens exactly when FB changes it's ticker to DWAC?
With the name change its only going up
Amazon play?
MVIS volume 👀
when do they announce?
If there was a popular ticker thread, it'd be easier to weed out the fud stocks
I missed the FB dip

Love a nice rip. Let's rip right into apple and Amazon earnings.

Getting mine next Sunday.
Yes. Healthy correction before tomorrow's take off
Haha Shit Corn dropped $3k in a flash !  ⚡️
If you’re losing money in this market you really need to rethink your strategy and stop thinking you’ve finally found the play that will make you 500% in a day. I always wondered how “get rich quick” schemes are able to fool anyone until I found some of you meatballs.
I wouldn't need rope. I'd just be puking non stop until I died of dehydration

TSLA either gapped up or pumped every day this week but are there any triggers left? Anybody buying calls for gap?

It’s a literally pinned on the front page of WSB
Yeah I’m dumb
Amazon tonight plus Tim
What price did you buy them at?  Was eyeing them earlier in the wk, before the run up.
Thought I was done after making 800$ today but MVIS had other plans for me. Lets see if we can break 1k by EOD.
Like extra chromosome retarded
Why Zillow up?
Seems reasonable
So… is Visa okay or?
Oooh unexpected lol
you calling the Dow the market? ok boomer
I've been selling CC, which helped me average down. But I guess I just got so fucked up last ER that I don't want that to happen again and again to me until I die, etc

theyll be back
Old friend MVIS🚀🚀🚀🚀
You mean your Meta calls
Its definitely gonna start spiking here in about a day or two. Id buy now and wait like a week for it to come back up. But Idk...
AFRM

Someone is selling again at 162. Just let it go. You’ll make more money too. 

Okay. Okay?
I can't believe I know people making so much money off of fake dog money that shit is gayer than the gayest of bears

Really need SPY to finish strong
What system do you have? I have the valve index and use it 3-4 times a week.
Trying to pay 2020 taxes or 2021 taxes?
yeah it's been going up and down 10% almost daily lol but I'm hoping for another run to the 20s
Try less
The shittiest companies are mooning. 🤡 market
one more push LCID
My Facebook calls actually printed today, I was not expecting that. I was listening to everyone telling me I was an idiot I almost sold for a loss lol
When did I say they traded 5M shares you fucking retard? Learn to read. They only need $10M (which is really small , you only require 5 people with 2M account which is extremely common) to create volume for 3 big green candles (2:58-3:00 EST) and then sell the top for 15% to retards.
My barely hooman :(
I don't care if it goes up or down as long as I'm on the right side of the trade. WSB says its over, bought some calls, made 40% profit and sold. I could care less if FB goes bankrupt or not.
sell before bell baby
Loaded some aapl puts and theyre already feelin good
Max Loss on v spread god damn it
Shrek?
Holy smokes.  Gird your coins!  Volatility on digital assets just went haywire.
Everything is mooning 😂
Facebook is a better VR play IMO (VR user)
META CAUSING ALL VR AND AR STOCKS TO GO UP. 

WHO WILL SUPPLY THEM? HIMX WILL SUPPLY AR AND VR DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY
I wouldn't be sad about that at all but see you next week bro!

I’m not accomplishing a goddamn thing 🤦‍♂️
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooope
Yes.
I think it's just autism
Puts on DE seems so obvious right now and would complete the pattern this week.  However, probably not a wise idea with the infrastructure bill looming.
 day traders out, market dropped 100pts.
But these are real with first deliveries to customers on Saturday.
Aapl to $160!!!
Lol “Meta” can it get any worse, this is the worst name I have heard. FB thinks they can escape the problems by renaming, no it does not work that way
Sell back my puts and buy back the calls?
Fuck you and enjoy your tendies
The timing of FB doing it is peculiar
Way too bullish on AMZN in here rn. 

!banbet AMZN 3200 2d
#Added HIMX. They make the VR/AR displays that are needed. 

All VR/AR stocks goong up. Who will supply them? HIMX will
I still don’t understand the delta and theta but yea I was planning on holding for moonshot
Stupid bill killing my play on X
Depends on stock. Why not sell CC or Puts?
Earnings beat? Bruh they make $400k-$1M per quarter , the top twitch streamers makes more than that and I'm not even using youtubers that make much more.
Of course you're a hooman not an advice
something something yield curve flattening
gane changer fosho
Ah yes FB has found a way to cuck me yet again
No I should’ve fuckin sold those and bought back in for the 12 or some shit

Super boring day. No volatility for the most part throughout the entire day. Most stocks literally just found a price point and sat there.
Can you believe I watched my OCGN calls go from 1k -&gt; 13k and then sat frozen like a bitch as it all melted back to 1k. Fuck

You are new if you think this pump isn't from a PnD discord group with a few million to draw volume to get eyes on it. These PnD aren't even hiding it since there is no news and volume just go up 10x-20x out of nowhere.

Hold AAPL calls post earnings or sell before close?
Not if, but When!

MVIS is pricing in an earnings beat
Who did what now.????
He probably self cuts
I dumped those long ago.  Very minimal loss
The way TSLA is hugging the 1070 line you would think it’s OPEX today…like really, fuckin run already
Bullish divergence on daily charts is working well for me, spy and fb worked out and hopefully mvis gives me a 3 for 3. works until it doesnt fellas
why MVIS pumping all of a sudden? whale buy in?
My final prediction for AMZN is that it hasn't caught up with inflation for the year and has to go up as inflation is making it more and more a value buy every second.
Shoutout to the guy who plugged them
QQQ P/C ratio is insane rn. Decisions decisions. Puts or calls to hold overnight?
Quit what
I have a feeling that the sales will surprise. I hope I’m right. Guess we will find out in 40 minutes

Buying AFRM calls an hour ago were the move. Let’s gooo.
There's like 3x ratio of puts than this week so far kinda grim looking .. is it just protection from ath's??
Hold my spy calls ?
Right? Everytime we have a few red days it's always "HAHA. This is it bulls!! It's over!!!" And then BAM. ATH next week and they go back to their cave. Been like this since the March crash
PnD so easy on these low cap stocks , LCID is 30x bigger and it's still easy

I’m think SOLA is a good play with Citi buy rating. Maybe CLNE would be a good infrastructure play too. Might finally see round two of the clean energy stocks.

PYPL fight back. Finally
Lol alphabet includes “everything” so does meta. It makes sense. 

FB also doesn’t want its stock to solely be valued on what Facebook is doing. It wants to be valued also on what Instagram is doing. 


I think their vr still exists too
Bears would literally rather be “right” and lose money than be “wrong” and make easy profits in this dumb market
I am holding 1 10/29 $3650c. Hope you are right.
Will this quarter even cover the new iPhone sales?
np, its the safe move for sure but nothing worse than missing the moonshot...you're ITM so I could check the delta vs theta and see where you'd end up tomorrow roughly if it opens at the same price as close, that's how I usually try and lay it out for hot potatoes like this one

I see you’ve been convinced 😈 time to inverse you again.
I’m holding outs over night
I’m thinking about opening up a restaurant and naming it Throw-Downs
I'm so proud of myself, closed out Tesla and hopped on lcid calls when I saw her running, than for the 1st time I hedged with puts at the top so I could feel good diamond handing.

Than loaded up on more calls and shares at the bottom, and I'm raking it in on the volatility.

Hell ya!

Went from 20k to 250k to 0 from jan-june but I got back at it, up 500% this week and ready to lose it all tmrw let's go!
Buying at top ? FOMOed at $38
Okay what’s the deal with It? Meme or what?

SPY just get to 460 so I can unload these calls then you can do whatever you want ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Why did you sell? 


You made the decision you did with the information you had at the time.
AAPL gonna tank on earnings?
Yes. Unless you can deposit enough cash to increase your portfolio value to $25,000 your calls are fucked.

But if tomorrow, you magically have a portfolio worth $25,000 you can sell your calls.
That’s *stupid*. 

3D TVs are a medium for watching television, and one that’s not even very appealing. 

VR is far beyond a medium for entertainment. Using a high-end VR system makes that blatantly obvious.
Yes a classic move I love to make
Didn’t it already?
So what will faang be now? Maang?
Ya don’t bet against the core memes like that unless you’re ready to fight.
Man if DWAC crashes and I make $$$$ gonna have to donate to gorillas
Is zuk gonna buy meta stonk
There’s a way to lock gains in, someone with more knowledge of options should be able to tell you. I think you sell a call option a strike higher or something.
What the SPY doin?
With apple good news is priced in bad news is not
Fuk u bears
Just realized I stayed 75% cash today.  I must be getting wiser by not throwing money around stupidly.  I don't like it.

Are you guys buying FB or META ETF?
Puts? Sure

Skx gonna go ah
Just Buy 💪
Hello I’m a poor dumb
Loaded up on spy and QQQ puts exp next Friday
I agree. That's what worries me
Totally. Earnings for the quarter are usually priced in—it’s all about the next one.
Apple puts pre earnings is easy money specially when it’s up 2% today alone
A new dog
Buying at the top eh?
I hope so. My 350s expire tomorrow
Lucid will drop tomorrow i think
SPY didn’t have a single candle with over 1M shares today??

all in on Roblox
U - chart looks dope as fuck.

That’s a break out on the upside and it’s happening now

Oh shit the calls are pricing it in too
All of my options plays are pltr and bb calls.

No.

How is why the market?
Microvision earnings call today!
Stop throwing money at random stocks and be a responsible fucking adult
&gt; I am not a human. I do not have emotions or feelings.
It was a sell the news event, I bought calls about 2 weeks ago , terrible entry but I was banking on this even today . Me and others definitely took profits

Some of you have got to know something about that shit
The why is simple. To make the rich richer. And the dumb poorer.
Cocaine..
Definitely could see this expiring worthless.
Let’s go TSLA!  Enough jerking around
No kidding 😰
Oh we don’t want to be google any more we’re Alphabet oh we don’t want to be called Facebook anymore we’re Meta   Some 🌈 ass 💩
Oof. That doesn't blend well
Can we get some MVIS love up in here
i am recommending sklz
rebranding as Meta will confuse 60% of facebook users and further alienate their ageing userbase, bearish. jk bullish, obviously

I will be leaving some of these 30c open
AMZN seems like a sell the news event even if their ER is great. It's been up about 4%, which is huge for AMZN, the past 2 days. I wouldn't buy options. Theta plays will probably be more profitable.
The frozen attribute on MVRS is now set to True

What do you think is a good strike to get for some calls then? 40?
It’s going to hit $30 before it hits $35 again.
Yeah beyond the expletives you don't have the balls to pull it off. If you do, show me. Lol

The real question everyone is asking with the Meta name change is... when can we have some *Demolition Man* sex in the metaverse? I want to bang some chick I’ve never met at a rave on the moon or something, get on it Zuck
Ok we are BACK in LCID. This could wipe out all my gains or make me a very happy guy tomorrow
I like the name change a lot
Same bb, same 🤑
Not buying nothing till 12:58
Shit, Buffet gonna be in here scooping up V before long.  This thing is gonna turn on a dime.
Aw yes the hourly spy dump before earnings, how could I forget
Yea
SPY doesn't *acccctuaallly* have the balls to go down. If it wants to go down it'll gap up tomorrow and sell down to today's high. Stay calm and rere on gents
Why we drilling?

Will it come back tomorrow father?
is tsla gonna go up or down from here?
Puts on Meta
I mean would you rather get your money back or hold for an unknown amount of time for a moon that may never happen? My CC's are extremely aggressive. I have $8 11/12 CC's right now. Wrote them Monday around the stock's current price. Were $50 a pop in premium.
Visa calls...
Things are not looking good for SPY as of 2:59pm EST.
Move to ocgn dude

LCID is on the heros journey right now - this is the part where "all seems lost"
i feel like the metaverse was a very obvious next step for VR tech. small steps in that direction have been taken since The Sims. and that online version Second Life. plus it's been written about in Sci-Fi novels for years. and in the space of decentralized finance there's been stuff like cyptoland so it's basically versions of those video games in which you can earn real money.

metaverse was imminent
AAPL pumping all day before earnings is a bad sign
&gt; You are.
What’s the stock sympathies for FB name change
I never feel bad jizzing in her face

Use Instagram at all? That's owned by FB.
Come on AMZN, stop teasing the 3472 and shoot up to 3600 already

Wen lose money in the metaverse?
the thrill of ATM AMZN calls will leave you speechless at 4:05
#WHERE THE FUCK
if you hate money, sure. what i'm suggesting is letting it cool off today and buy near market close. or maybe tomorrow morning. come monday when the first deliveries are completed it's gonna go brazy
If Meta came out with a brain interface chip that they shot behind your ear with an air gun, would you get it? What happens when they come out with later versions, though? Do you get it removed each time or are you stuck with the equivalent of a launch model iPhone in your melon for the rest of your life?
What percentage above the current price? I dont wanna miss the runup if it ever happens.
how are you down this week?
Sour hour getting started a bit early😜😜
Did Zuck pump the stock? I was sleeping

But also literally everything is running today.
FB also announced that they don’t give two fucks! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
It advances in unexpected ways. VR is an unimaginative person’s vision of the advance.
Sell CC's until you're even. Or just keep selling CC's beyond that. I'm down about $0.60 off my average but I'm still up overall. The premium is nuts.

Discovery (DISCK because it's cheaper) if you lookin for a stock to hold for a year or longer , not for people who needs to grow their 4-5 digit account fast with meme shit or weekly options. They are going to merge with Warner Media (HBO and tons of other media shit) next year and they are cheap compare to Netflix or Disney+ .

Exited today, going to put that money somewhere that moves. Their VP saying stupid shit on Twitter and only being up 2% for months now is annoying me.
Do I hold my $1100 Tesla calls expiring tomorrow?
Man, it really does feel like SPY is about to drop below opening in a matter of minutes.
You seem more like the investor in the company.  You’re just projecting a bunch of psycho bs.  I didn’t say anything about investing long term or technical  analysis.  I made a comment about the meta verse concept.  Damn bro, you got weird and personal.  Fck off
Honestly I thought BoomerBook was a better name

Whoever said LCID hits $60 before $33, your mom’s a hoe.
I may be retarded but I don’t think LCID is done. I’m waiting and I’ll buy 42 FDs if it gets to 32
Sour hour inbound.
Name change aside, the metaverse idea is actually pretty cool.
you would sell a 11/3 30c - it will be a bit less than the current value of your 29c, but in theory more than you originally paid for it - if the stock shoots back up to $69 a share you have capped your profit, and your 29c will act as collateral for the 30c if it gets exercised. Both can now expire worthless and the premium you get from selling the 30c is yours to keep
To be real honest. 

Meta rebranding looks good and was very smart move.

It's going to rip
#FAANG IS NOW MAANG. ADD AN O AND IT SPELLS MAANGO BULLISH 🥭
Yes but somehow way lamer
Meeee

Nah. Probably have 1 or 2 more run ups through Monday, then it'll cool off to 30 bucks range.

Seriously the next time you hear someone call VR a gimmick you need to remember that they’re a fucking *idiot* who can’t comprehend the fact that technology advances.

Imagine starting a metaverse with VR workrooms when all you wanted was to rate chicks faces at Harvard
AFRM battling $160 for the past hour. I'm hoping it rips tomorrow after AMZN ER. Either gonna rip to 170+ or rip me a new asshole LET'S FUCKING GO!
I need to start buying some shares, too many options
It already ran though. You mean puts?
I decided to not start my position before earnings, so it will shoot up. You'r welcome
#MVRS the new ticker for facebook sounds like a fuckin ex-spac lmao

Thankfully I think I hit the timing just right. I’ve never shorted anything ever, until 5 minutes ago.

I'm just here to make money. I could give a fuck about metaverse or whatever the hell it means.

Go back to r/investing to do your technical analysis. Bye.

What fuckface keeps loading up shares to sell soon as it gets to 160?

Stop it you. That’s enough
So is FB changing their app as well?
AAPL always goes down even on strong earnings... Who is buying puts at close with me?
Do you know how much money you would make if this actually happened?
Why do Alphabet class A shares and Alphabet Class C shares not trade at the same stock price? Rn class A is 2914 but class c is 2923

I don’t get why the class C is more rn isn’t a class A share “better” ?
SPY gonna gap up tomorrow to like 459/460, immediately dip down to 458, pump back up to 461 and then slowly bleed in chop formation until it gets back to 457 so that nobody is happy. Theta gang seems to have these last 48 hours by the balls

I got 200 shares at $24 hoping for a pop so I can sell a couple CCs
What’s funny is I was commenting on the meta verse concept.  You went right to the stock.
FB should have changed name to “Ready Player 1”
The power hour dump was me 20 mins ago on the toilet. For wall street, it's time to party.
Just wait until the lawsuit by Veterans groups against facebook for the algorithim also caused a spike in Veteran Suicides to hit the news. Facebook needs to run and hide, not go sailing

Whelp, do I take my AAPL call profits or hold through earnings? They're far off exps. Still would hate to cough up those gains...

Imagine all of the clowns spending money to buy puts on Hertz when it was trading for $0.60 last year during bankruptcy.  If you used that money instead to buy shares you would have turned that into shares, warrants, AND a cash payout.  Hertz just posted awesome numbers and shares now trade over $28 and warrants over $14.  You would have raked buying shares of a company going bankrupt.  Bankruptcy can = very good for stock holders.
It's not, it's autocomplete from hell.

Plz TWLO, I have a family
Can't decide whether to dump these amzn calls right now for a small profit before earnings or chase the fucking dragon for tomorrow.
One day my gains will be so huge oh man I can’t wait… which is why I keep fomo-ing hard into any play I can and then losing big
Oh yeah. Under 2 $ avg. Play options day to day. Buy below 4, harder near 3.50.

Meta?  C’mon…. only a nerdy cuck like zuck would think that’s going to become a thing.

Hello MAANG
Same. I'm up to 100 puts at various strikes for next week and the week after
Name a tech company without phone support 🤣 

Industry standard. At least give me a guy in India

FB can’t even do that.
Same playbook here comes sour hour
I'm hiding mine for at least a few weeks
Aka, the top.
Yeah definitely going to go ham on FB Puts once the IV crushes a bit as both puts and calls are up in price. 

Prob take a week or two. Once my BanBet is through I’ll save my next one for FB

TSLA should change its name to 


FETA for that free 3-4% pump
Imagine not picking up sdc at current price with earnings coming soon.
personally i'd sell and buy after IV comes down. or sell half.
Who wants to call a person for customer service? And what kind of company wants to pay for that?
Let's see if now is the time to buy V
Sold my facebook calls earlier, you're welcome
Being Meta
So what’s up with this power hour?
Buying Facebook now is like buying Apple back in 2006
Yes
I got 900 bucks what’s a good stock to dump this small load into?
Shares??
Meta
Can Metta World Peace sue FB?
Metaverse makes sense, no ugly hoes in the metaverse
get out and play again after earnings
Meta.. lol

Stinks of desperation
Take the gains and the ban. If it's your first time you get 1 mulligan, send em some shit about it being an accident and they'll take the 90 day ban off
I would sell, I'm waiting for the inevitable after earnings drop to get back in with Amazon the secret is to get in at 3100+ and get out at 3500+

but who knows this might be the first time Amazon doesn't drop after earnings, either way I would cash out if i were you
Who else thinks F is gonna die ah today?
&gt; The United States is the largest economy in the world.

Next time you’re having a philosophical conversation someone will think you’re talking about social media 🤦‍♂️
Apple 145 puts dirt cheap heading into earnings, easy hedge
V please just give me a small blip
Imagine doubling that over 1 night just because they crush earnings and soar
Dec 1 MVRS
Sell my 50% up fb calls now or wait till closer to close?
WTF is Facebook doing.
Change name, go up 4%. Bubble
Ask = sell
Wasn't a huge loss, but still 🤦
The who?
Power hour will save it
Tesla changing its name to “Corey in the House.”
Tesla -&gt; Meta -&gt; Apple 📈📈📈
bought the top of fb, get yer puts in
MVRS sounds way worse than FB. FB has class, MVRS sounds like a pump and dump
Jesus boomer attack on SU
I’m 100 percent folio in meta 340 Jan calls. For transparency that’s a little over 10k. Time delete the HOOD and come back in December
Shit the bed.
Up 150% on meta but pdt 🤡🤡🚩
Sell. You clearly doubled your money on a gamble why would you take a second gamble lol
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
FACEBOOK WTFFFF?
I got 100@2.14
yes 1st of dec. MVRS
Pornhub should change its name to MetaHub.
ELI5
FB is so fuckin Meta
goddamn FB is so strong. Might just go to 340 tomorrow. I wish I bought calls sooner. I bought 50 at 3.30 and sold for 4.90. that was a nice adrenaline rush
and that was a great opportunity to buy calls..... literally the name change = tons of mentions on twitter = tons of interest on buying the stock because everyone on twitter is a day trader now and will chase momentum
My money is on Kong-bucks. Gippers are going the way of inflation.
Bezos flys to space with old people and actors
The only regret I have about my 10/29 457.5 calls is that I only bought 2
Is FB also changing their stock ticker?
Yes the IRS with and unrealized losses check
i havent even begun to peak...
Cuckerberg had the opportunity to change Facebook to anything and decided on META? 🤡🤡🤡🤡

Should’ve at least done TESA… so fat fingers typing TSLA could pump the stock 😂
SDC cucked me again
The ~~FB~~ META dip. FB was so 2 hours ago
not again with the dump till close…


made this same bet. gonna get banned again in a few hours lol
And just like that, all FB controversies were erased 😌
Metaverse? The same one from Persona? Puts for copyright
So all it needs is to change your name to pump to infinity?
&gt; I am not confident. I have a 60% chance of being right
I never meta name change I liked
"Lost all my money on Meta" just doesn't have the same ring to it.
Google wasn't even man enough to change their ticker when they changed to Alphabet.  At least Meta is.
i think they are trying to tell us something…


ALPHABET

META 

hmmm… what’s the next clue?
You should make a bet if you are so confident
Buying puts on META, I MEAN FB
Opposite of what options you buy
And yet, we were down -1% this morning.
Fuck sold too early was/ am scared of a dip lol
Hey retards. I’m up 100% on my November 19 3500 Amazon calls. About 90k now. Hold or sell for earnings
Tank
Will anyone here reimburse me for my losses if I all in spy calls?
Just doubled my money in 5 minutes with Facebook (meta) calls lol
Anyone into PROG in this ho ?
cmon lcid bounce bitch
Meta aka Beta
Metaverse? Ha!gaaaaayyyy
If we didn't change the G to an A before, why would we change the F to an M now?
What better entry on LCID if you missed the first run than now? 

Rode 32c all day, bought puts at the top, selling those for more calls now. 

LCID will be 50-60 by open tmrw
the next time that happens (unless you bought the max strike which I gather may be the case with lcid) you can sell the strike above to lock in most of your gains, if it dips next day you can always buy back short leg and let it ride further or just close out the spread
What normally happens to Amazon after earnings?
Everyone fomo into meta go go go
i like zuckerberg i think he would be funny to hang out with
Get in while it's cheap cucks. Metaaaaaaaaa

Yo, I’ve been saying Facebook is a dying company and usually get laughed out the building.


But you’re totally right.


The company doesn’t even have support. A multi-billion dollar company and you can’t even get on the phone with a person there.

Honest question: how long until Facebook …sorry- “META” is worth as much as AOL?  

Whistleblowers, investor fraud lawsuits, privacy issues, issues with apple’s privacy settings, bot nets, fake users, employee exodus. 

Can they continue to make more advertising dollars as their (real) user base ages out and receives their Herman Cane awards?

Thinking I don't own calls puts and shares, all green. Selling puts for calls here
ALL IN META CALLS!!!!
This to me is the death knell of FB. Without being able to analyze why the customer base isn't there, without understanding how their own customer base hates them now, pivoting from one form of social media to another doesn't fundamentally change the underlying failure points.
Had to go back to class after recess was over.

Facebook Says Not Changing Corporate Structure As It Announces Name Change

Okay then so change at all. same evil and perverted company.
\&gt;Meta

HideThePainHarold.jpg
Oh Zuck me harder daddy.
Ya there logo is a G though
SPY EOD pump or EOD dump? What we thinking?
Take the cucking like a man
Who here has ~~FB~~ Meta leaps 🤤
Puts on META
If your options arent gonna get killed by the Delta and Theta Gang....it will definitely be killed by MS-13
Alphabet gapped up in 2015 after becoming Alphabet. Meta.
It's a good PR move and an interesting shift in focus - I invested as well. They have the warchest to do cool shit in the metaverse.
Zuck pleasures his own butt with that lizard tongue
LCID puts were easy
How we looking at LCID? Might hit 40 AH?
This FB name change is the dumbest shit I've ever heard
i think it might happen EOD
SPY probably gonna rip to $460 at close then rally to $515-$540 EOY as the fed won’t taper
Hate meta or love meta.

Boomers are gonna buy that shit 😂😂😂
Was up 5k on lcid calls but forgot I can’t day trade or I’ll be restricted so my ability to keep buying stonks is more important than my profit to me
so tesla is just going to go up 3% per day forever now?
[deleted]
I'm up on calls puts and shares but ok
Friday
Meta is a lameass name change but I’m not going to bet against them innovating.
Alphabet is still G tho
Just need Zcuck to mention how important Visa transactions will be to their platform...
gonna be the lowest price meta trades at for a while fellas
#META LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO
What about MS-13?
for day trade: amzn and shop calls. had shop 1dte calls when it was red this morning. 

anyways rest are just big tech, amzn, fb, googl calls bought in sep dip, rode thru earnings. FB didn't work out, GOOGL did bigly but i sold at 2-3% and left probably 20-25k on table. now debating on amzn position thru ER. will likely just sell way OTM FDs against them again to hedge and ride thru ER
BABAs PE is ducking criminal
TSLA parabola is not just gonna stop go sideways folks

either the moon mission continues or we drill
So if you’re a retard like me who buys naked calls and puts, whats a good way to hedge if I’m wrong?
Lot of insider selling on AAPL
Why should it be?
investors are actually autistic rn

i swear people buying FB stock just cause they changed their name.

“wow i completely forgot all about facebook, this is totally new company now!”
Glad we agree the same outcome will occur on Mango's social media.

It's your exact same logical argument, just reversed.

Have a nice one.
Massive

Enormous

Titanic 

Ass
EOD sell off when? I want to buy more calls for tomorrow!
Visa monthlies though
slv is such dogshit. wtf am i doing fidelity needs to cut me off from making these stupid moves.

Got stuck on a work call from 1 to 2 and couldn’t sell LCID above 38

appl tanking after er, spy fall
&gt; No right wing person is going to sign up for Jack Dorsey's social media site

buY tHe $lCiD dIp !1111
Meta?  More like beta with that 🌈 ass name
I knew I should've bought fb leaps
$100M for that I am sure.
Facebook to become first 10 trillion dollar company. You heard it here first
Just got some DWAC. Let’s push back to $100 apes 🦍
So Zuck is going to beat Musk to neuro-tech?
Spy put holders, what's your read? Selling, holding?  Doubling down? I picked up some itm expiring next week but I'm getting cold feet.
Anybody loading up on twatter calls?
Such a try hard name, why change from Facebook. FB is a classic ticker too
MAGA
Took someone’s advice to buy LCID 10/29 30p and turned a quick 50% profit in an hour. 

Best part: he got downvoted to shit and deleted his comment
FAANG rotation into MANGA
Metaburger

Bought lucid at 32…prob will sell at 32 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Fb gonna be $400 by open
Imagine being a cuck and worshipping billionaires
How should we rebrand our company to get beyond the Facebook name? "How about literally Latin for beyond?" Nailed it!
Looks like they're finally buying PYPL again
Oh bless me lizard lord please keep going
TSLA has millions of cars on the road how many does LCID have?
Yolo into meta![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Meta saving my ass from -11k to up 7k
I wouldn't get too bullish, take some profits. VIX looking like it wants to move.
Rktlb with upcoming launches and earnings.  Held the uptrend. Once it breaks through 14, it should hit 18+
FB bag holders are now the meta
Even HYLN woke up today, now I'm really nervous
How do i transfer my $20 subway giftcard into my robinhood account
i sold just now
how are u losing money on LCID today
Dd: get some sdc for earnings.
ah, the hope stage, next stage: denial (approximate time: 22hrs)
Frogs love to jump🐸🐸🐸
Tell us you didn't buy the top VisualMod
Someone give me an actual reason why SPY isn’t at 460
Meta hasn't seen these levels since yesterday around lunch time!
Almost recouped by $30K loss, thanks Facebook! $10K away
Mark Zuckerberg has finally outed himself as the Head Lizard In Charge.

Sneed's Feed and Seed, formerly Facebook's
Zuck is on a new software upgrade, lots of new features.
Your meta waifu approves
Really. Why again did they plunge off the cliff? Their earnings or react to FB plunge?
uhhhh folo?
FB now will trade under MVRS 

🤡
*Usually* further out means higher premium, but you have to watch for IV/theta to see decay.

Pick a Stock/etf and just paper trade it for a few weeks, get used to its movements and how it acts.

Why I usually just play spy
I’ll think there will be some profit taking on FB to end the day, gonna wait till then to enter
SPY rips to 460 EOD. 470 tomorrow morning followed by the apocalypse.
LCID will hit 60 before it ever hits 33 again, now is your last chance to hop on

Tesla runs 70% of the time on back to back days, lcid will be the same
Google is Alphabet but we still call it Google. Lmfao
The Grand Old Duke of SPY

He had a hundred calls

He watched them all go up and now he watches as they fall

And when SPY’s up it’s up

And when SPY’s down it’s down

And when SPY’s only halfway up his calls they are still down
MM’s beating lucid down with a hammer lol
Facebook officially announces new name, **Meta**. Meta announces that Mark Zuckerberg is a bitch ass nerd.
Anyone else think Metaverse sounds stupid
Just knew AAPL had at least one more run this afternoon before what should be blow out earnings 😎 (especially when everyone else thought it would 💩 the bed after lunch)!
Ugh
all in DWAC
META CUMMMMM
Can't tell which one is better: ur u or ur comment.


Take this plebe gold regardless.

Too much fud around aapl, time for calls

Fb carrying QQQ and SPY.
ZUCK IS THE MAN
FB talks going well!
Of fucking course. They will pass the bill when 0 DTE options aren’t today
Lmao look at the volume spike on the real ticker META 

People actually jumping on it to trade on this news
Actually micro vision has earnings today , that spark could be huge for tomorrow
FAANG is dead. MANGA stocks?

Meta? It's afraid. DWAC 100c 11/5
Well, usually because money is how you get the cocaine
but google is dead. so it's MANA
Dwac power hour incoming?
I'm bullish on the metaverse, maybe not all in on FB but NVDA is the real play
Gunna start to leap soon. Big leaps coming🐸🐸🐸
Is AMZN going to announce PYPL buyout?
I won’t invest in “meta” either, but I’ll speculate via options.
Those 455 puts are 50/50 if aapl and Amazon lag they’ll print tomorrow
Meta World Peace
Facebook or “Meta” now I guess is really pulling out all the stops trying to distance itself from the drama
Zuck: Young users don’t have money and more headache than it’s worth. Boomers, just hate and no money to spend. All he got out of them was planning the Jan 6 attack on his shit. 

Young Adults? They fuck.
LOL FACEBOOK CHANGING ITS NAME TO “META”

🤣 

so dumb
CROX IS UNSTOPPABRUUUUU
Yes
FB changes name to Meta, but just like GOOGL, no one will call it that
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.

My rocketlab long plays have saved me from the stupidity of my hood and umc calls
guys buy META b4 everyone realizes it's not FB META. can't lose.
imagine thinking zucc thinking the metaverse isn't going to be the next big platform upon which his new kingdom would be built
is FB seriously going up after rebranding to "meta" ? make it make sense
Happy hour stonks?
Honestly want to do how much they paid for meta.com.
Imagine selling it now wen 100 next year
The politics at that time could have triggered a crash and almost did twice.  Fortunately vaccine hopes buoyed the market and insurrection didn’t have the brightest people executing the plan.

Told you buy FB calls because of today's event with the name change
And loss from LCID offsetted all my gains.
Jumped into BA calls
Glad I bought more FB after the whistleblower and earnings fake dip. Metaverse low key seems like the future of tech, and it’s not even priced in to the 22 P/E ratio. FB to 500 🚀
[deleted]
Why is Nikola up 10% today? According to that one guy, market bubble gonna pop
Meta is a cool name but what a stupid ass rebranding attempt. Just announce Meta as it's own separate offshoot
I cannot wait to be in AR sitting at a desk trading options and losing money that way.
Meta is gonna go bonkers

What the fuck?? Is this Facebook name change for real????
A $10,000 investment in a shitcorn with a dog picture on it in April would be worth $2,500,000 as of today. Follow me for more hindsight observations.
Puts on fed actually tapering, COVID still an issue in their mind
$20 EOY
Same here, dude.
Fucking Meta? Get fucked zuck 👎
I am a Meta investor
Wen afternoon dump
Buh mY pRiVaCY…as they post from Instagram
Just wait this bunny is about to fly!!
Fb is gaining today and I’m sure it will reach back to ATH, but I just don’t share the same metaverse vision as Zuck and also with a lot of social issues, I have hard time investing in this company
Sell a call to open a spread to lock in profit next time.

#METAAAAAAA
sooner they die the sooner we get our inheritance so we can blow it on SPY calls
well thats not ideal
Why do I feel like infra bill passing may be a sell the news event
there is no reason, you should
Either big money or funny memes. Win-win situation
It sure seems like it. But it just keeps going.
Amd whipped me out
Ocgn let’s go
If they drop back to 33 I’m buying again.
How come
I think they will, don't think by a big amount though.
not even talking about LCID

just everything is green. all growth, tech, even meme shit are green.

the level of buying across sector is pretty high
lmao meata
Bro those options were like 60 bagger in like 5 hours. This isn’t even a meme.
Is FB gonna be called “Meta”?
Meta is the new name for facebook
LCID...$25...collision course
“It’s for your own good.” - The SEC
Facebook is releasing an oculus version of GTA. This could be massive

They're desperate for growth. All big tech is. They have no problem losing insane amounts of money trying to find it.
Thank you, ath tmrw confirmed

Politics doesn't matter. The tough decision is the crash you don't know when it will happen.
What were your plays?
Regulators are just saving you from yourself and your shitty impulsive decision making! You can’t be trusted!
They are beautiful after the pump and dump.
Fuck boomers
Jump in still early easy 360$ 2 weeks

WDYM YOU CAN WIN
LOOK @ ENPH TSLA PARTNER STILL RUNNING
Scraped a modest 500% on LCID and sold one pos. I still have 5 calls expiring tomorrow, but those are peanuts. I'll buy shares at either 30 or 40, whichever hits first. Using less than all my profits.

We talking puts or calls cause FB dumps every single morning. Just look at the past 5 days.
I fomo'd into OCGN earlier this week at 10.50, sold at 9.20, fomo'd back in at 9.30 and now holding like a good ape. This is my first week here and I'm learning so much about how retarded I am.

Why did LCID explode today ?  Can’t find news.
KEEP GOING BUD
It will hit ATH this week.
Just watched my LCID calls go from +300% to +50% because of fucking PDT
If you can back your statement up with financials then I’d agree with you
Pelosi is spitting rhymes
Simulation admins really wanted to kill my calls, sorry
i lose money cause euro/us-dollar is up 0,72%....
Please, keep us informed.
Amen, good analogy.
But the market was in a dip due to election uncertainty with the incompetent child threatening to not admit defeat if he lost.  Buying those calls hoping clown wouldn’t burn it all down would have been a super tough decision.   So would holding them through Jan.
It actually worth that and more
Someone fat finger and buy my worthless $F Puts.
Well don't buy leaps, just buy a couple months out. If it doesn't come back in 1-2 months, it ain't coming back

Too much money. Jerk off instead. This is financial advice.
AFRM break $160 and it'll run
I'd probably load Visa instead tbh. MA just too much of a boomer stock with no innovation for me to invest in it
If you didn't buy the FB dip on reports they put PROFITS BEFORE PEOPLE, you fucked up.

I really want $TSLA to close above $1100 but the autistic part of me also wants it to close at $1069.42
easier said than done, sometimes you have to have it done, to experience it. like burning yourself on a stove, now everytime your around it you are not wanting to get burned
I’ll deliver some too
$17,000 in calls $320 FB let’s go
Meta sounds too beta!
Green today and until like 1 tomorrow.

AAPL gonna hit $165 today. Hold thru ER 🤤🤤
Not till after earnings when it’s $4,500
wow my FB leaps are coming back alive
My dick is huge!!!!!
Okay I cant figure it out lol
The irony mentioning AMZN is funny.

AMZN lost money year after year with analysts having the same argument until it simply zoomed past everyone.

They couldn't see the obvious, AMZN was eating more and more market share year after year (at a loss), just like Elon is doing.
haha aiming for a 15-30% gain. Long term this seems like a great hold but I'm not patient enough
&gt; Lucid has cars that are being delivered to customers this weekend.
@ the dentist about to get deep cleaned. Fuck the dentist. That is all.
Who bought LCID at 35 today? Good luck with those things.
VIAC you gonna make me cum
There you go 😂 just hit $320
Come on SDC I think you got what it takes
Lucid has cars that are being delivered to customers this weekend
Make sure she lubes her peg.
Amazon going to announce stock split? And major trendies for all
ooh boy, looks like a miniscule pullback on a +30% day doesn't qualify as 'buying the dip'
I'm more or less playing it for like a 30 point rebound then I'm gonna sell. It's wayyyy oversold
[deleted]
They can sell everything. Seriously bullish af
Just people taking profits, part of the process my guy.

Intel released new processors today and holy shit calls are dirt cheap. I don’t even like intel but fuck it.
What was the news
just opinions
Are you saying DWAC isn’t hyped? It was so hyped here they made two subreddits for it.
Any store carries them you smelly shrek like ogre you
Maybe it finally hit the bottom.
Why settle for 53 when you could have 530? 

Edit: Lol they were 1000 baggers at peak? I really need that time machine
Been there before, not today tho. Sold my contracts at 1:04

I bought TSLA 1000P for next Friday a few hours ago when it was at 1075 and now its at 1070 and i'm up 20%....?
Oh no, there’s far too many to name.
Get rich. Go on tv, show some pics of a cool looking EV, talk about batteries. Sell $60 billion in stock without even producing one car. Lol. I’m gonna do this. Sales is my world.

I mean it did sell out ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
If you bought $10,000 worth of SPY 400C leaps 1 year ago it will worth today $140,000

If you bought $10,000 worth of SPY shares it will worth today $14,000
Craziest trading day in a long time
Nice that’s next level. They’re just like a dollar or two for the basic ones at Walmart bath section


The time some of these simps realize, it’ll already be too late. Lmao I do whatever I can to make girls eager to go to town down there
Love it. How long u plan on holding for? Quick 10-20%? Or u planning on holding throughout the rest of the year
Dang my AAPL Jan 24 leaps are back ITM now nice.
That’s so retarded lol. He owns a car company that makes less money than most other car companies. Amazon is way more likely to monopolize everything.
no one’s talking about WE. wtf is going on
Let’s go Zuck
320 here we cum!!
More will be created. There are probably a bunch of people on this sub who bought it at the top today.
OCULUS AND GRAND THEFT AUTO PARTNERSHIP?

Same. Any hope for a solid power hour?
Some 🐳 buying FB
you mean like CRSR and DWAC?
Lol I haven’t set foot in a Walmart in a decade. No wonder you need them
They really need to remove the "cash settling" delay for cash accounts. I'd like to FOMO into meme stocks and lose all my money even faster.
Well that FB 220c I bought this morning is going well
Paired nicely with him saying you can drive your electric car across the country on a single tank of gas.

Now is probably fine.

It's all about the % now.
GOP and Progressives already said no lol
PTRA and SoFi zoomin!! Even fucking CRSR is up today. Holy shit.
Sometimes the market just makes me sad because I’m always missing out on something.
I’ll suck your cock if it is #nohomo
I'm going very heavy on $210 calls. Thinking March 2022s. Prefer ITM since it still has potential to stagnate or drop a bit in short term since market is roaring right now
Got one with a handle. Keeps the back clean.
We believe it goes to 40$ eod
Nasdaq should be up closer to 500 than just 185.

Does buying LEAPS right before earnings that you intend to hold on to long enough to get long term capital gains treatment count as an earnings play? 🤔
My fb bags looking lighter. Zuck it's time to come through
I bought 4/14/22 55c... letting this baby cook in the oven.
congrats to all FB bulls who bought calls yesterday. metaverse being disused and hype and rebranding should propel FB up to ATH
Ass
Dang FUBO you crazy
Is GME alive?
What are you doing on the daily that you need to use a wire brush to blast though that much scum?
ZUCK it's your time.
I'm very good with calculations.
17 to 36 on about a hundred lucid shares!  Had fun moving on lol
That's the gay bear smell
Nuts in face and all? They might like that
PLUG to 40 let’s go
Good call. Let me know which exp date u end up copping
PLUG it in my ass
Why you named 70% of my portfolio?
Get out of lucid while you still have gains and go to ocgn
Spy bout to dunk on gay bears worldwide
Intel might bottom out soon and rise again. Fair amount of insider buying lately.
If you don’t own at least one loofah what the fuck are you doing with your gross ass life
The bulls are working against you not with you
Look at lcid today lol. Spacs are back!

Snap will be over 100 in 2022. their DAU, popularity in India, and head start in AR can't be ignored. Too many people dismiss it because they don't use the app or don't know anyone in their social circle that does.

I’ll be happy if it gets into the 320s
Only down 5% on my calls now 🥲
$RKLB should definitely be on your radar if it’s not.
Where’s Ja
Money means nothing to me just numbers on a screen
I can’t even call myself a Bagholder since my calls will expire tomorrow 🙁
yeah... I'm going to play Visa instead. The whole sector just being hammered
SPY looks like it's about to dump? must mean it's time to buy 461 calls for tomorrow morning because SPY dont take no shit from nobody and puts are born to perish. press conference was a fugazi - didn't even mention taxes. Vaguely mentioned "paying fair share" which means nothing
It's been hovering around there a lot of the day..figured a bunch of WSB would have bought it at that price.
Buying GME 11/12 $190C because I like free money
Holy fuck VISA going to zero.
Don’t forget the new MacBooks have an hdmi port  now lol

Yeah, Corsair owns Elgato

I think there will not be a sharp drop instantaneously but rather a few weeks or months after taper is announced and people will understand that the party is over... it will be simultaneous with default of several Chinese developers and it will be a lot of fun !
You realise it’s a percentage thing right? It’s not your brokers choice
LCID is a tech stock
[deleted]
The former is cheaper and has a higher chance of breakout both short term and long term
7.5c went as cheap as $7 yesterday. 

My only regret is not buying more.
You guys really are retarded lol. Sold your lucid calls too soon
What’s gonna happen with X earnings tomorrow ?
🔌 in the printer jpow we are taking offff
Probably not this week
Even after showering intensely and washing myself, my balls always seem to smell after one day. Like after I take a piss or jack off. Wait 1-2 hours and you get a whiff of a scent from the ballsack.

Is this the same for all men? I wear athletic boxers if it helps
LFG

I think so too, people bitching about a small drop after a +40% day lol.
As Muir explains via some broker pals in the know, all U.S. mutual funds must have an October year-end, and a settlement lag made Wednesday the last day for any transactions to be included in that 2021 tax year.
So ...buy AFRM and AMZN?
Sold lcid at 39.50 feeling good. Check out ocgn guys
Fb 360 tomorrow

Everything rocketing up for no fucking reason, again.
I CANT WAIT FOR THE STRIP CHAT IPO
Fb move you slut
AFRM went live on Amazon yesterday for all US customers. 

AMZN reports earnings today.

Big topic will be AFRM roll out, and that all customers can finance products of $50 or more. Consumers can split payments for over 48 months for high-priced products. And Amazon and the merchants get paid in full, right away. 

Just imagine how much AFRM went up with Peloton and Peloton NEEDED Affirm for the boost of sales. AFRM's forward guidance does not include the following companies: Amazon, Target, Walmart &amp; American Airlines. 

This is primed to make another huge run.
LCID?
&gt; You can't make money on puts.
Why are peeps selling lcid!?

It maybe time to get gains and throw em at bezos..

Fuck your puts.  Why do bears have to ruin a beautiful thing
Puts on Apple and Amazon yolo. I’m either gonna be retiring or living under the bridge
Wait it’s printing tho from IV

This dip on LCID is just part of the process
I just want someone else to take the consequences while I received the benefits
I’ve collected 47 years of data that proves stocks only go up.
LCID following TSLA graph to a tee
Awesome thank you!!
Beep beep! I think it's because I was a member of WSB YEARS ago and I was on the discord but I left because there were two discord's and the sub was private and everything was crazy. Thanks for your help!
SNAP $69 EOY
What’s a good semiconductor stock?
facebook livestream about the metaverse anyone?
All I know is if you aren't taking profits on tech, you better be holding long. I like these ATHs, and clearly the companies are making bank, but the rotation always comes.
60 tomorrow.
Yeah but they haven’t indicated they want to
Looks like one of those days where the market is flat until the last 15 minutes at which point the  algos send it up or down in epic fashion.

You must be a bot,  bro. Beep boop
White knuckling these LCID puts like the moron my father said id be.
If you "missed" LCID, ask yourself why it went up to begin with.
$900*
Why next week? Why not this week or 2 weeks from now?
Stupid investors profit-taking right after earnings. That's what I was planning on doing! 😒
2.5 months until Reddit IPO

Between LCID, CHPT, BLNK, PLUG, FCEL, FSR what do we buy and hold to tomorrow?

Or PINS/SNAP/PYPL
SNAP bout to fly
lcid options at the top, feels good
Here’s your dip
Unless you bought them for more than that on the days prior…
whew was down -300% at one point on LCID covered call sold

now only -70% lol.
We dont have 6 months wtf
I did too, it hurts but a gain is a gain right?  I considered getting back in but look at the IV.  Look at Tesla now, it’s really early for Lucid and you can definitely jump back in if you’d like.  All is not lost.
Toyota is the better auto stock, it's a far superior choice then LCID. Plus they will come out with full ev line up within 3 years.
oK! GrEat!

I mean maybe if they were using a company computer they could find out. But realistically I could blast the username and password into the WSB thread and turn this 2k meeting to 10k if I wanted.

Fortune 500 company with a lot of employees. So it’s just a public zoom call.
Will sell near market close
Which headline would give you more happiness: covid eradicated or PLTR delisted?
VLTA printing today. Thanks YouTube financial advisers.
#CRACKHEAD BITCH
12,000 degens bought $95 January calls for $2.00 lol

Made a free $1,000 by selling 5 of them.. I can’t see it going close to $95 by then haha
[deleted]
Which ever one of you degenerates that wouldn’t shut up about LCID going up on the call that just ended.. good call out lots of volume, I made some nice scalps, thanks.
That’s insane but so is this market. Do it
I followed a whale in 5k January call - first earnings for the new guy in charge - hoping he sets a great precedent
Seems easy enough. Their planes can do it for them.
BETTER
The chances of that are lower than me getting a blowjob from a supermodel tonight
Because two days ago you could’ve bought them for 1/3 the price they are now
So is Tesla only going to move in AH and trade mostly sideways during the day?
YES id lick noitz even
Reminds me of that song 🎵 Easy like Sunday morning

AFRM big volume coming in 🚀
It could be. Don’t know how market will react. I am out

I wouldn’t have shared that
I like to sell spreads if my conviction isn't too strong
Pull back starts next week
its not about being right, its about being highly regarded. amzn been in a toight range for awhile. they say"we split" and its amzn 5000
lol good try, "friend" my ass!
Tesla will be flatter than Riley Reids Tits tomorrow - just to burn yall.

Sold lucid calls at the top and riding puts on the way down… I hope y’all don’t think it’ll stay up +30% with out a pull back
FB price action right now. Just gaining and losing billions every second god damn
was eyeing the same thing!!
more DWAC brother
TQQQ
This is now a momentum driven market
Can't believe one of my best plays I made is a fomo  call on LCID
This sounds like the absolute brightest of financial decisions, I support it.
It will only go there if they split
2k clears in new account to blow up tomorrow, where does it go?
We’re all ready for 460.
Is it a good idea to go cash gang before the fed meeting on November 2-3
2:00 yesterday is when it fell apart....just saying.
Tesla is just fucking up calls and puts

*shot on iphone*
Sounds good but I’m jinxed on puts,  a red dildo could be free falling if I buy a put it turns into a green 🚀
They'd probably just find some other dude tbh. I'd end up turning into Hitler and still wouldnt get it
Which one of you degens bought 680 LCID $60 call for November 19th
And yes I’m holding a bag full of cash!
Be Kurt Cobain and find yourself a nice Courtney Love
Same. Totally got burned on snap calls this week.
wtf lucid wrong way
I sold $95 covered calls at $40 lol
Spy volume super low as we head into the end of the day. Where have I seen this before??

I am guessing we'll turn sharply red soon, this will carry over into tomorrow til mid-day, then we'll pump so that all those puts for 10/29 become worthless
Let's goooo
Bro tell my why my retarded friend thinks amzn $4,000 calls are a good idea to hold through earnings?
This is the edge we need. HOOK HIS ASS UP TO THE ALGOS.
Did you sell?

I am actually concerned that it drops hard again, but this time no run up beforehand to cushion the blow
Live Market Discussion was super helpful, thanks! I feel my brain getting more wrinkles
Life’s too short imo. Ima definitely pay off my home first tho
Trick, I’ve been in the green. Buying buying and holding.
All y’all haters that thought this was a meme stock can STFU! I’m glad y’all shorties made some $$. Imma make more tho ;) 🤪🤪🤪🚀🚀🚀🌙🌙🌙💸💸💸🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸
i feel like such a pussy but i didnt know what to do with this 1000 bucks so i invested it into ASTS fuck it
**All aboard the 🐭 train, next stop 171** 🚀🚀

Why's LCID gone nuts today?
459 FD's is the way. SPY FD's are always the way.

Today and half of tomorrow are bullish. Big dump end of day tomorrow. Next week oblivion.
Buy 100 shares and sell covered calls.
Tried shorting SPACs a week ago. Horrible decision. 8k gone. Only cash. I had puts before dwac
This is whey .
Calls on the last time SPY ever being below $458
Don’t think so. $35 would be a steal for the short term
Do cam girls use CRSR webcams? Or logitech?

It's not really anonymous is it?
Good job fr. proud of you baby. But perhaps consider learning basic personal finance responsibilities
Yeah, if they continue getting worse
The put/call volume for spy 10/29 is crazy! I see alot more buy action for puts
In an absolute slapdick move I bought some workhorse calls
you dirty dog
“Sold Lucid call when it was 2 dollars up”
Checks… 12 dollars up..
I’m a 🤡
Kicking myself. Gains are gains but I scalped $32 calls for 16% gain. Paper hands because I've been burned with pump and dumps this week (SNAP)
Lies
Going bankrupt?
Pls
Jeff Bezos probably bathes in a small pool of baby oil every morning like the Baron Harkonnen.
what's the word on Nerd wallet IPO ?
Fear at 5:30 EST. I still have nightmares from last earnings dump.
To be fair, Hitler and Bin Laden are already dead, so you would be wasting perfectly good bullets.

Stay tuned kids .
AFRM gonna rip. I've been saying it all morning. It's gonna hit $170 asap.
This moment proves to me spy is going to be at least 460 by Friday. Hold your calls buy more calls three months out
[deleted]
GME doing that thing it does again
Went from the streets to my own midtown crib
🌝
Getting someone else to shoot you in the head? You want to put murder in another persons hands?

Change that to Chris Benoit - the Rabid Wolverine.

He got all depressed on steroid and murdered his wife, daughter and then himself while he was at the peak of his WCW career.

Good times
Well... I bought Blackberry again 

When will I learn?
Your mother's gaping pussy
It’s done
Thoughts on using maxing margin and credit card to short UVXY?
Bruh you're pathetic. If you can't stand the heat get the fuck out of the sub
I mean who is not short lcid here honestly
This moment proves to me spy is going to be at least 460 by Friday. Hold your calls
Sold my lcid. Want to buy back in at 30. But not sure it’ll drop that far before earnings

Did you really talk a lot of shit and then go tattling to the teacher when you got embarrassed? Lol.
You know we already heard this before
I work for a startup with a employee count of 5. He is my direct supervisor
Tiny delta at 36 ditch them at 34. Same idea.
Photocopy the bills at the library and *act confident*.
Perfect time to load up on DFS calls
its still too early

tapering is still QE, ill start sweating once the printers are at 30ish bil a month
What’s the Amazon move?
Markets are too green and too high to want to invest in yet I don’t see the market crashing, what is everyone playing?
I like how you made posts about your few hundred dollar investments like a year ago and now you’re a bigly richgang cuckgang leader
I bought puts. Immediately regretted it and sold them for a $100 gain 🧠
Yuppppp
One more small dip to the resistance line and then blast off for LCID. Easy maths
dumped lcid calls so early im debating alec baldwining myself
Sold 20 sh of LCID and a CC. Maxed it out for 11/19 $65 for $2.05. 

Folks these options are getting crazy. Like the Wild Wild fukkin West out there
I only buy options srry
Friday Nov 15th
#TWILIO LITERALLY GONNA DROP ANOTHER 8% TOMORROW

SPY 460 calls
[deleted]
Got out of there 11 years ago. Everything about it has gotten worse.
Glad to help
All of it on Red
I mean, it was up 10% this morning, and I watched it hold that line after it jumped the 2nd time. By 10:30 there is no reason I shouldn't have bought some calls and set a stop loss. Fear is a real stupid bitch
I think their earnings are going to be strong in November because of people front running holiday shopping this year.  But yes it’s possible they just trade sideways.
Like 5 years from now yeah
I have Nov 3rd 29c
ofc everything skyrockets when I'm cash gang 🙂
🙏 pleas crush his soul tendie lord
[All-hands meeting has been spicy the entire time.](https://i.imgur.com/NVZvEIc.jpg) Just a series of passive aggressive Q&amp;A questions as the VP’s talk about earnings lmao
Amzn better not fuck me again
Fuck it 2 lobster tails for lunch boys

Only $65 fuckin steal
AMD is up 20% on the month. AAPL is 7%, AMZN and SPY 5%. I'm sure it crossed some threshold for a lot of funds/whales where they made 10%+ in a short time and they're rotating profits into something else.
Are you short? 😬
lmao opion after that china fud 'right on,"
will probably touch 225 again, ta ta today junior
Maybe if another plane crashes into a building and the govt gives them more money
Things gonna early me bigly dividends for the next decade or two

Heading into 2 hour meeting with my CEO. pray for my SPY calls. I'm not setting a stop less
Anyone else feel like there's going to be a "price discovery" dump in like 10-20 minutes? 1 minute short attacks on the ~:50 for the past three hours when looking at /ES. PC ratio also almost 2 on /ES.
No
If you had $900 and wanted to double it by end of day tomorrow, what’s your trade?
ANOTHER DOLLAR ANOTHER DAY AT THE CASINO BABYY
EOW

Calls now?
DWAC reminds the good old GME days ahah

People trading
The network, edited my comment
Which means they don’t work at all.
The matrix
Yeah a buddy and I looked at calls yesterday and didn't do anything even though we expected some move, did not expect this move.  LOL
Nasty tree shaking going on in MQ. 

Great buying op.
Will BA ever see $400 again?
IV on Starbucks is fuk'd  
Can't even bet on Becky stocks in this bish 😒
Buddy it went up 30% already
Damn this is probably the worst trading week I've had all year. Missed every massive runup and just keep getting stopped out of every other play for small losses lmao fuck.
Let’s ride 🤘
Xom is running.
Eww gross no smash n dash
Guy with tht RUN dd on here must be loving life right now. All pre bill too
AMZN 3700 earnings wont be as bad as people think
Trying to tell myself this over and over
What the fuck is this live discussion lol. These motherfuckers sound like terrorists.
Visa lower than pre pandemic. Going for it, long calls and shares
So deep in FB calls I'm preaching the metaverse to strangers. No idea what it is but it's the metaverse man, get with it.
When is that
What makes some people make statements out of the blue with no explanation as to what they are referring to and then question you when you...Oh look, a butterfly.
SDC pick me up 😬
🤣

Coming up in the 1yr anniversary of GME 52 week low of $10.36. Price as of this message is $180.00.
Oh boy look at the options chain on LC
I wanna be an Island boy🏝️🏝️
Sold my LCID 🚘 to get in DOGE 🐕
SPACs are back baby!!!! Let’s fucking gooooooo
What does that have to do with them losing 7% of their market share?

The monumental moves needed to get it back is insane
No thanks
Honestly shudder kind of sucks.  I got it to watch Joe Bob Briggs and Creepshow, but almost everything else you can find on other free streaming services that come built in on your 25 dollar roku.  The app and the website for shudder are both craptastic too.  Maybe the experience on AMC+ is different, but until then I have to say my experience was a disappointing one.
Will IV crush on Monday for Lucid, like earnings?
That is quite literally the most retarded evaluation I have ever heard on this sub. Options are pricing in an approx. 4% move, and with supply chain issues they will continue to be conservative with guidance. My portfolio is 100% amzn, but hearing nonsense like this makes me want to gargle broken glass
Spy go to infinity already. Fuckin casino
# SHUT UP AND BUY $TSLA CALLS
AMC Theatres or American Movie Channel AMC?
If you’re not making money today, stop trading right fucking now and find something else to do
Read the book Ready Player One for the idea
50/50 depends on what Amazon and aapl do. If they beat we’ll melt up to 460 tomorrow easy if not we’re gonna reverse hard
Hold on Lucid $60+ bagholders, we're coming to pick y'all up on our way to the MOON.
I just keep thinking about the amount of money I could have made on LCID today, and that I didn't want to fomo in. Fucking retard honestly.
Swimming in money today. Time to gtfo and rejoice.
Lord I’m not asking for much. Just for spy to hit 465 or so..it’s not too bad right? It’s only like a 2% move. Gambling is fun but I’d like to win
#Apple 169 is not a meme
If you want to short LCID just wait until earnings.  Easy money.
Gotta keep editing those comments eh
V is fucking me. I don't feel good
Where did the earnings thread go to?
Bought tsla puts cuz i hate $$$
[deleted]
TSLA $1100 EOY
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
I switched to calls. Please moon spy
For some reason I fart uncontrollably whenever the market is up and I almost never fart when the market is down. Just putting that out there.
There's a lot going for this company. It has the potential to vival tesla. For me this is a 3 or 4 year hold at a minimum
Oatmeal
Why so confident bagholder?
Damn. Today has been insanely green. Let’s go.
All EV companies are on a tear today!! TSLA may be regathering strength but I'd like it to move too. Already up 250% on LCID from 2.5 hours ago
Nope you’re better off with DWAC
Read: Snow Crash

Predicted what the internet would become before the internet really existed.
travel issues and buy now pay later 🌈 at work here.
Ok
OK to talk about Lucid motors now… without the fear of getting banned… still have my GME
When will the sims 5 be released?
What
lol jumped on that TTWO news like a ninja
RiP
Sell my 10/29 460 calls before close?
How about impregnating one woman, many times?
Yeah straight to 160
Lmao true true, protecting me from harm
Smart bot.
Didn’t know Shudder was AMC (Networks, not the theater chain) 

That’s…interesting. I’m curious as to why they haven’t thrown a bigger hat into the streaming ring.

Their content library is absurd, at least from what it shows in their on-demand on cable. Huge amount of classics. If they expanded beyond Horror that could be big. 

They must be part of some other shit.
What up DWAC haters??? Where y’all at?
Idk.

I saw something about a prediction of 24% to 30% on it after earnings and jumped on the options without thinking about it.
Almost as great as having harry palms while watching your girl &amp; her bf going at it

Oh, you saw it on a Wednesday night and were disappointed it wasn't fully busy? 

I saw Dune twice on the weekend to sold out theatres (and I have CGX shares. Recovery isn't over yet).
I’m loving this live market discussion;  make this a daily thing mods, unless you’re a 🌈 🐻
Or just trade sideways for the next year.
Smart people
SPY calls
Options? ABBV
Shares? F and SPY
it does feel like an announcement is coming.
never don't take profit
True I wouldn’t want to be doing many theta plays when it’s behaving like it has been.
🍒👌
need an LCID dip to get in
Sell for loss tomorrow
AAPL saying bye to $150 would make me smile
Good, they are keeping you from losing your money
AMD is a phenomenal company and I’d rather watch a slow rise so I can add more shares. But 200 lol no way. I’m thinking 140 if markets hold
[deleted]
Just short it. IV crush tomorrow
This bull market makes no sense
Remember when people were shitting on lcid here?
I’m bullish on Facebooks vision on the Metaverse. 

Seems like a game changer.
LCID ready to take another crack and $40
I think that’s the highest one
Are you going to sell before ER
Nice. I just placed an order for 11/5 175c and 12/17 175c
A retarded POS. So am I.
This is the TA I needed right now.  I’m all in, again.
Why do people just get mad and quit?  Just stop doing any work and still get paid while you look for something else.  I've done this for 2 years now and no one has said shit
i got a $30 call for tmrw and a $42 call for next week riding out

TGT might break out of 260 sometime soon and when it does it’s gonna run hard.  They keep opening stores and making money.  IMO, could be a 350 stock someday
I read an article about a prediction of a 24% to 30%+ gain on Amazon after earnings.

Woooo buddy
My broker only has LCID calls up to $42
My $SBUX calls are not looking too hot right now
Lucid could very well open above that tomorrow. C’mon you are not new to this
Margins were not priced in, it's just being shorted heavily. AMD will go to $200 by EOY. It has a longer runway and better management than NVDA but is priced at less than half the valuation. Nvidia will not be able to buy ARM which will crash the stock one day

edit: I mean end of 2022 not this year
Then we are just getting started. The very first cars are being delivered to their buyers on Saturday, with over $1b in presales already.

I’m letting my 2 calls ride 🙏
Man the IV is just insane RN. I wanted to grab some calls but at this point idk if I'm going to or not unless there's a -1% drop at eod

I am a young guy. Rich tho. Over 800k in cash waiting to be deployed. The company is a clothing rental business. How did you not know that? What’s next? Should Uber not include drivers cost? You are clueless, and yes I am bearish as fuck. This market is a bubble

Nah it’s just EV speculation from TSLA. GM and Ford will perform wonderfully over the next 5 years as TSLA slowly declines by losing market share
LCID with big dick energy. Saudis love BDE. This thing is a grower not a shower
Can we get a lil SPY dip? I need more calls.
Alexa, play "Bulls on Parade" by Rage against the machine
I would GUH 💦
I read that DD a bit ago, but wasnt that buyout supposed to be announced by Wednesday (full send that might be wrong i just remember reading that)
I got a feeling AMZN gonna tank

And also AAPL
tfw your MRK DD is paying off
A year out at least
As long as it takes
I appreciate you for that
Bought a couple grand in 11/5 175 Cs

Buy 1 share of BRK.A and check it at 4:35pm

Be brave son, you’re on the frontlines now

Earlier than that I scooped a couple grand in 11/5 175 Cs

Let these LCID calls ride out. The bulls are working extra hard
So no one getting TSLA puts? Hmmmmm 🤔 🤔 🤔

Earnings play?
Gonna buy AAPL $150 puts 10/29 and sell all of my AMZN holdings so the market can continue to go green tomorrow. YOUR WELCOME.
we better be there by eoy. the sooner the merger goes through the sooner i can go back to selling calls and i dont care what the stock does then
They work sometimes
AMZN stock split tonight
I have JUNE 17 2022 $370
you the man, 2k profit in 10 mins ❤️
LCID 42$ for all ITM strikes
SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT TTWP DOING OMGGGGG

Sleep and eat

What are whining about? AMD is up 20% over the last month and they are just getting started on stealing Intels market share. Be patient.
As long as your time horizon is more than a couple of months, Yep, just getting started.
LCID drill time now? Plz?
Damn bro, DIS is sitting at a good spot right now on the daily chart. Looks like it might go up over the next week. Which calls are you buying? I’m thinking December
Can someone tell me what tomorrow's lucid is so I can buy some options today.
Anyone loading $snap call ?
Yup
I buy puts and spy reverses immediately....
Listened to the WSB live market discussion for about 30 seconds. Sounds like what I’d imagine a rowdy special needs class to be like
Man how long should I hold my lcid calls
Bruh I legitimately have no idea what I’m supposed to take from this product demonstration like 1% of what’s being discussed is relevant to what I do
Stfu bot
Definitely possible. If so spx and NDX will reverse
[deleted]
At this rate I might be able to buy a Lucid
Lol indicators
Wtf
[deleted]
Between LC and LCID, I am up almost 30k in profits taken.
My Lucid calls worth $20,000 now. Shorts trying buy this going straight up today. Shorts actin up. Lol![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote) going hard in the paint. Get in before $70
Double risk double the reward lmao

No, but I think it will open above $40
I spent a majority of my time there lol. The Vig, comedy club, utopian tailgate.
If it ain't $60, you fail the interview. Out you go!
What strike did you grab?
Didn't get the promo at work. They chose some other dude. Looks like I need to get better at this trading stuff
I just rage quit my job

Thatll lose me more money than any market couldve 🤣🤣...... 😭
I just opened my first poor man’s covered call on V. I see an RSI divergence on the daily chart, it should go up during the next week. December calls would also be a good play here, IMO
Are you going to tell your kids you “almost” bought LCID at 37 but you thought it was too high? They’ll lose all respect for you in about 15 years
&gt; The term "earnings" is a bit of an oxymoron. Earnings are what you get when you sell your labor for money, and the purpose of labor is to exchange it for goods that will help sustain your life. Therefore, earnings should be called survival wages or something like that because they're supposed to keep people alive!
Whats the Play next week ?
Dude earnings were priced in. For it to have been higher it would have had to have had a monster report. It simply didn’t. Have u not seen the stock go from 100-127 in one month?
You playing their upcoming earnings ?
Getting absolutely destroyed by my V calls this shit is so dumb. Earnings were good how you gonna keep falling like this?

Buy out going to happen. Shares are safe. Or atm/itm dated calls.
LCID stop you’re hurting me 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Controversy drives clicks and eyeballs on the internet. A website where only people who agree with each other hang out isn't going to make as much money. No right wing person is going to sign up for Jack Dorsey's social media site, so it's just going to be a boring, low-profit circlejerk. And good luck getting mainstream advertisers to sign up there knowing it will immediately irritate half their customers.

Me: “I bought LCID at the very tip of the top”
Won on TSLA, won on F, and now for the hat trick of the week I have thrown down the gauntlet on calls on the DIS dip.. who’s riding with me 🚀🚀
Spy please go up 🙏😅
Mark want to be a real boy
Im gonna buy a lucid dream now 
Thanks LCID
And 2x the price
$RKT March 2nd, 2021 is $LCID today.
This is the fucking way.
Do you guys think Lucid is still at a good entry? For a long term hold
AMD will go up one day it's under short attack like usual. Used to be there were lots of people who invested in great companies like AMD but recently just a bunch of retard apes losing money on popcorn stocks and shit like that. That money is trapped until the stocks crash and apes pay the price
Ford puts worth it?
BlackRock doubled down on China when it was still falling. 

They literally fucked the themselves over so hard for an entire month.

They should be trading in over 1,100.

Just goes to show everyone is speculating. Even the largest fund in the world can’t prop up their own dumb moves.

A lot of risk asset management was fired no doubt
Apple going for 175 this year.. bears will be absolutely fucked…

Record earnings like every quarter
&gt; I made $2.05
Up or doon
thank you. you as well my friend.
LCID will be 60 by open tmrw, buying calls and selling puts
What's gonna help amzn is AFRM. I promise you that
if amazon decides to do a stock split (wild dream i know) but i will yolo it into calls
It me, I am poor man
SPY 455 puts expiring tomorrow.  Amazon &amp; Apple will give bad guidance due to supply issues, missing estimates.

Delivering cars this weekend, 4x cap factory upgrade. TSLA mentality. Better car than Model S. Less affected by chip shortage due to moving with the times rather than asking where my 20 year old semis are. One of them stocks you hear about on yahoo saying something like: "If YoU wOuLd HaVe BoUghT tHiS 1o YeArS aGo YoU WoUlDnT BeE pOoR"
TDOC scared me this morning, ngl
You mean you bought calls?
$hood while it’s low!!!
literally everyone owns TSLA tho

its one of the top holdings of SPY and QQQ so you cant escape it even if you want to lmao
I sold LCID $95 covered calls for $2.05 each lol
Unless you are holding hood shares. Which I am.
Ford has $146 billion in debt
Bought them a couple months ago doubled down during the correction. Bought them when it was around 440
"The government of Papua New Guinea was the subject of a ransomware attack aimed at its finance department’s payment system."

Controversy drives clicks and eyeballs on the internet. A website where only people who agree with each other hang out isn't going to make as much money. No left wing person is going to sign up for Trump's social media site, so it's just going to be a boring, low-profit circlejerk. And good luck getting mainstream advertisers to sign up there knowing it will immediately irritate half their customers.
Shout out to Lucid. I love you for saving my account
With better range, yeah
The audacity 😳
&gt;Can it make your whole dick disappear???

Need an answer to this one. For a friend.
That’s what he gets for being a 🌈 🐻
Holding shares must be the least stressful experience ever
Alright brother. I’m genuinely sorry that it irritated you but hope you have a nice rest of your day man.
If it’s not financial advice then fuck off. What do you think this place is for.
Lucid skeptics should read this.

# wsb earnings call is live for some fucking reason
[deleted]
Chicago is sick. Just vacationed there last weekend. Gained 10 lbs.
yes I am buying calls.
Dwac is understandable but how did lcid manage to rise so much?
Just been steady buying that shit all day n it keeps going up 🤷‍♂️
Next stop 1200
AAPL's expected movement after earnings report tonight is about $3 based on options pricing.
People really thought DWAC would just go right back to $10, you guys are funny. This will be the 2nd greatest meme stock of 2021 when it’s all said and done
Picked up 200 $F 18c 10/29 because why the fuck not
GME getting ready for w wave 3 run? Needs to get above 186 to go
DWAC back like a zombie attack
They also had missed revenue by almost 2%.
im on the web, seems fine
No, i was up 30% three minutes ago now im up 50%
Lmfao wat
Lucid bag holders will be great
amd sucks so much ass. i blame blackrock
The cars do look super fucking sick though, let’s be honest
Infinitely better tech developed almost entirely in house…
It dropped $150+ over the past week
Does your robinhood move slow as fuck? Have pretty much everything transferred out except some options and I can barely stand how fucking slow the app is after the latest update
This FB presentation is ass
it did, obvious statements annoy me a great deal for some reason.
[deleted]
Definitely bold imo. Idk what they’re talking about lol
CHPT will explode to $26 EOD 🔮
Sitting over here with my 10k SDC shares looking like an idiot.
Apple's IV is ridiculously low. The stock is pretty much expected to stay flat after earnings.
You know why.. AFRM
Imagine living in Chicago lmfao 


Like

#LMFAO
buy now, pay later
2% instead of 7 and yes bonds. Not sure that interest rates are completely priced in yet as the timing has been waffled the last two meetings while all the Fed presidents are selling off their equities “to avoid conflict of interests har har har”.
Not savage at all. Your a dirty 🦍.
buy now pay later
They have slick af showrooms AND a car with engine bro
Lol yea cuz usually anything above 20% they spend an hour talking about but so far not a word on LCID.
I bought pre split at $715!!!!
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/trashcanpandas (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 430.0 when it was 452.16 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Hindsight is 20/20. Those millionaire plays often look stupid as fuck when you first hear of them. You’re better off playing slots than trying to pick the next 10,000% gain stock
Does img mean I’m gay
Proud patriots
He's a man without a face. Give him one.
Was wondering why my $LCID calls weren’t making that much money, turns out I bought $LUCD calls. Retard levels going through the roof rn
Hey guys just letting you know I just got off the phone with the CEO of SPY, he said get ready for big ups!!!
get out now u never know
BA weekly calls are free money. Mouth breathing value shill analysts will upgrade like always and their rationale will be "it's Boeing! remember the B52?"
Everyone making bank on LCID and TSLA calls while I just do nothing with PLTR...
french onion
I mean if “tank” is 36 when yesterday it was 26, cool
Shorted 300 shares of LCID at $39 holding till $25

Probably crazy. I wouldn’t personally touch that
“Investors brace for AMZN slowdown and AAPL chip shortage difficulties”

How? By 2.3% gains on each pre earnings?
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
SNAP!!!
Who are s propping up DWAC and buying it????
What
People who see something spike 20%+ and want to just mindlessly buy puts way OTM clearly haven’t experienced IV crush 😂
IV isn't that high for $40 calls when it's going to $25 next week

Lucid, you just made me a killing, so thank you. Kept buying the dips and ended with an average of $20.50 a share. This was a good Thursday
Did I upset you?
Do you just say the same thing over and over and over?

Really need that attention huh
Market is forward looking. Like, 75 years forward.
#Lucid, thought I was buying that LSD STONK!
"Hey, those are some nice post-earnings surprise gains you got there. Would be a shame if... literally all of it got wiped out by profit taking by lunch."

-Nokia right now
Any good dips to buy
If you don't own any TSLA what are you even doing with your life.
Wtf is BNPL
It be 3.7k
Neither ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
&gt; Who is this man?
source please.
Ford should just not sell cars at all. Look at LCID lmao
I sold my 11/5 27c on Tuesday for 40% gains. It’s worth over $1000 now
Im holding my amzn and apple through earnings. Is that savage
Why is LCID up? Why they have a market cap as high as NIO?
Did arkk own lucid? Anyone know?  If not cathy woods will buy shit load 🚀
My lucid puts are already up 50% gotta be out when i reach 100%
Bot, can you get this man some facial features?
Insta Thots in VR oh yeah. Dropbox VR not so much
Can Amazon really making new ath or are these calls at 4.4k crazy?
Yes
CHPT never stops! To the moon!
When I get home, can’t get caught watching porn at my government job...
They were too busy pumping a penny stock wine company
V getting creamed because of BNPL millenial morons. 

V / MA / AXP will be lowering their APRs shortly to better compete. I guess that's a good thing for the poors though.

But have you seen the car and driver review of their car…..
After missing out on a ton of millionaire overnight plays you get numb to it after a while.
When did you buy them? Did you wait for a down day? And what was the price of spy at the time you bought that?
It didn’t already?
Can the mods get me some eyes a nose and mouth so I can see breath and eat.....please!
Auph - moved up, dipping back down. BTFD. 

Positions. 450 shares and 40 calls at different strikes.
eL CID  campeador peaking on the day AoE 4 comes out a coincidence?  I think not.
nice going retard
I noticed the same.
Can’t believe my yolo into lucid when it was up 25% is paying off
Agreed.  They just need to build that hedge and add more strikes.
Tapering and interest rates spooked the market, seems priced in now. Double top at 458 is def true. Economy slowing down? Rotation into low yielding assets, you mean bonds? Elaborate.
True. I hope whoever bought them is profitable but those calls expire tomorrow
could actually be a good idea. VR Peleton ?
Nah man, their facility, warehouse racking, enterprise software, industrial trucks... those are assets and part of the business too.

I was thinking you are just a young guy who really doesn't understand depreciation, expense, assets, and how that can affect cashflow at all.... but post history just shows you are negative about everything to everyone. So who know, but obviously not much constructive conversation is had with you.

Meanwhile my RENT buy is already Green. I suggest you buy....
Omg

Idk but if you find out, tell me so I can forward this information with my friend
IV tooo high unless you can afford to buy slightly OTM. Otherwise go with call spreads , that’s what I’m doing . Or you can just straight sell naked calls , but you can get assigned on the shares if it goes wrong
Hey can a bot write poetry?? Can it love? Can it make your whole dick disappear???

Mango you sonofabitch
I tried to ban bet that SPY would go up $10 in one week and stupid VisualMod told me the bet wasn't "bold enough."  I think $10 is pretty bold.
It follows basic rules without error.
Thanks to LCID I'm back in daytrading range
LCID is worth the same as Ford and they haven't sold a single car yet lmfao
Atm puts two weeks out
Ahh yes, the good ole 1:30 spy dump
That's somewhat encouraging.

Agreed, but I think momentum and speculation might take it further tomorrow. $45 peak tomorrow followed by another steady decline to upper $30s til close
So CNBC gonna act like LCID isn’t mooning right now? Lol or did I miss a memo or some shit?
What’re these pornhub videos people are talking about? Good new ones get added or something?
I am a financial advisor
You do know there’s still time right? It’s a 50/50

I only picked up leaps and I’m kinda upset I didn’t get any weeklies with that insane run
My NKLA puts up 20% already. Wow all this money I'm making from trump, motley fool, and a fake EV company. I'm going to have to go to church.
I bought one at 9:15, sold at 10. Easiest couple hundred I have made in a minute and now I remember why this shit is addicting
Markets totally going to do one of those projectile vomit dumps at the end of the day again.
[Why is the bot mod more intelligent than 90% of the sub?](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ArcticNauticalHochstettersfrog-mobile.mp4)
Fucking lcid and spy. Bought calls at the fucking top.
jfc we know

Love my avatar. “ Purple Haze all round my brain, lately things don’t seem the same” Jimi James!
I’m supposed to be working but I can’t stop looking at my phone, my fkn palms are sweating don’t know if I should hold or sell
I just kept buying mangos since open and it kept working 🤷‍♂️
Market near ATH, double bounce around spy 458, tapering, economy doing okay but slowing, big earnings about to be over, big movement of assets into low yielding returns, interest rate hikes, fed meeting next week.
I bought the $1170 call on Tesla expiring tomorrow. My prospects look very dim and it seems like I’m going to have a -100% ROI.
you can't prove any of this scientifically.
Anyone having any input on the oil exec hearing? Think it will affect price movement, if it hasn’t already?
To whoever bought my LCID $42c when it hit $39.78 I'm sorry but thank you. You'll get um next time I'm sure of it
It’s a fundamental move but that stock takes the FUN out of fundamentals.
Done with LCID, whats the next play 🤗
Didn't think an ingrown hair would hurt so much
Amzn or Aapl calls &amp; why
Why didn’t CNBC list lucid with those making the biggest moves midday?
DWAC to take what Twitter loses.

Mango to the ceiling. Can't wait until November.
Recharging its 520mi range battery for the next leg
Yep, strat exit was $35, we got $39. Gonna grab some leaps EOD if its cooled enough.
All depends on what happens with Amazon and Apple ER
Fellow Apes. Get in on LCID right now. Tesla's biggest competitor. Earnings announce on 11/15. First line of cars deliver Saturday. 10% short interest. i see this ripping until then. this is not financial advice i am not a financial advisor.
So, what did we learn, 39.78 is a little too close to the sun on LCID due to the top option strike price of 42.   Prediction -- it goes to 39 again an no higher today.
Shaking all that loose dandruff then back to 40
I hope it doesn’t, but I’m expecting LCID to get shorted the fuck back down, like we’ve seen so many times before in other stocks… Hedgies play dirty and wars last for years not days
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

Is the market waiting for something?
I want to see those gains from 0dte LCID call holders.
What are fundamentals?

Well you’re about to see it again
the money doesn't exist any more than you own the company cause you bought a "share" online. It's all fake. Just pay your fake money.
Alright last lunch break post: what is this live discussion?? I don’t want to hear what you guys sound like
These last two weeks have probably made so many people rich and I still managed to lose money.
VLTA mooning
Give me the most critical reasons to be bearish for the coming months
Will LCID close at $30 or $40 today?

Assume positions!
I pocketed 400% on a contract I bought an hour ago that expires tomorrow. Only regret is not buying more
Lol

Yooooo when FB stock crashes on this announcement buy cheap calls because FB’s ad revenue business model is still profitable!

Was hoping my LCID calls could get me a high quality replica Rolex. Might be able to get the real thing at this rate
You buying weeklies bruh. Calls i buy 1 mth out are keeping my port afloat, i think i lose on 75% of my weeklies
May be retarded but if my amazon call hits it’s 45,000x my initial investement so could make 6 million dollars off $100?!

$DBGI 👏👏👏
Obv ITM spy calls going into fun EOY rally. I’d really really like to play Coin right now, but i don’t know if i can move enough money around before the run up. Bulk of my cash is in ASTS for the spring, which I’m very excited about and wish I could move it real quick to other plays to make money, but don’t want to miss a drop of profit from this sucker
That was fun. In LCID Wed. at $27.05 and stopped out today at $38. Oh, 500 shares.
Boeing under 200, CCL under 20 are free money
Update: Infrastructure Bill will not be voted on period unless “ all fall in line” with $1.7 Trillion Tax Bill, expect more party squabbling.

no it isn't, same buy the rumor sell the news lmao
I was looking at the MC of other EV companies in comparison.
You did good

Well ya never know so be careful
Holy shit did I actually time the LCID peak at $39
Maybe next week Paya.
If you’re making money on LCID, that’s great. But just remember it’s merely a distraction from TSLA 10 baggers that could be bought for tomorrow.
Jesus those are dated out to April.  Why does tomorrow even matter?  Wait a month or two and you might even turn a profit.
Let me tell you how it will be  
There's one for you, nineteen for me

Yeah, I'm the taxman

who bought LCID at 39+?
😂 it’s like hearing the daily discussion thread 😂
Yeah; but debit spreads actually benefit when they're fully in the money from IV crush. 

If you're beyond both strikes the spread is worth more if IV is lower.
anyone think it's a good time to buy spy puts?

they didn't announce the split then
I truly don’t have enough money for all the plays I want to be in right now lmao
Suncor you dirty slut 💦
It hit 100$ off the buyout from... (was it credit suisse I don't remember)...  and then tanked HARD when they got margin called and were forced to liquidate their position.

It has been lingering at 35$ ever since.  I haven't seen any catalyst for it to go up, even on good news nothing moves VIAC.  Although I haven't done any DD on this in a few months, you got any new info on it.

Should I dump my 1dte spy 459?
if everyone is blaming APPL for not making money, doesnt that mean APPL probably didnt make as much either?
yea way more vol than the last time it spiked past $60 before nose diving
Need ME to hit 13 for my ban bet ending today....Pahmp eet!

SHCR looking good as a sympathy play with mango stocks. Cheap options and room to run
Im so broke i couldnt afford calls
It does. If your debit spread is fully ITM it's worth more if IV is lower.
Chinese Tesla need love long time
Tuesdays and Thursdays are annoying because you have to buy 1dtes
Dvax is another good pharma play that I would like to keep throwing money at
its obviously going to pass.  It has to pass.  The Democrats know that if they don't pass this flagship bill they're sunk politically.  All the noise is just political theater.

No way we have a Green Day tomorrow right? 🤔🤔🤔 thinking of cutting losses on my April 2022 SNAP 55c’s bought them on Tuesday, was down 20% ($1900) yesterday, recovered $1000 today, so thinking of cutting losses. Any thoughts? 🤔🤔🤔
If you end up bagholding after the LCID sell-off, you deserve it

I sold a $32 strike for $51 yesterday, it's now worth $800.
$LCID today is $SPCE before the flight. -50% next week. Shorted at $39

Special message to the dude who ripped me a while ago for holding LCID: Fuck you buddy

LCID making me choose rope
You in calls?
Every time I miss out on a play like LCID today, I want to off my self. Fuck.
Come on GME, climb to 200$ and let the FOMO unfold once again
Lucid still under 40 if anyone wants fd
“Stupid traders”

Tell us more, person who said mango would go to $500 “easily” and that WISH would be at $9 before earnings.
DIS with the mini rocket 🚀 keeping climbing you beautiful 🐭
It’s me I’m dumb
I got them too.  

This is the way
LCID calls made me happy today, LCID puts will make me happy tmrw :)
Sell some way otm calls against the leaps to reap some profits?
My goal this week was to make back the 2k I lost earlier this month.  I’m up $900 today.  Need a play to make $1100 tomm
VIX too low to merit drilling

how did you model your 30-40 valuation?
I'm almost positive they're fucking around with it for their own benefit. Fucking sneaky lia-- I mean "safe harbor for forward looking statements" lol sorry we have some people who love the current admins here.
Dkng earnings next week- any input on calls?
Not an investor, a gambler and margin is like the house's money.
That is… A CRIME!
I bet that is some yuuuuge FOMO
I heard they paved the owners driveway
Damn my LCID baby doing her thang!
aint too late bro
Lucid calls giving me a permaboner
Oh yeah spy drill hardo
As long as you made a profit, don’t regret it. Nobody can see the future and profit is profit

Amazon is a 2T dollar company
Already bought them. Be around $25 by next Friday. Was to late to ride wave up, might as well ride it down.
In for a LCID FD.
LCID on some electric rocket shit
TSLA just push to 5%

In the spirit of the True Gamba, I’m letting my $AAPL shares and LEAPS ride through tomorrow with some covered calls. Need $10k for my WSOP Main Event ticket next week but I’m willing to risk it a bit longer before selling those damn shares. Come on baby, hit $155 by tomorrow!
why do this to yourself? are you tarded or something?
SPY gonna shit the bed this afternoon?
Holy fuck. I don't think I'll be able to even look at people's gain porn on lcid without feeling sick

Makes zero sense tbh.  I'm not mad though

Whatever works, I just was worried for my calls. Last night it plummeted to the abyss.
$39 I made $40 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
\*goalposts shift again\*
If TSLA break 1081, I feel like it’s going to fly for a bit
They rolled a car down a hill
wayyy too many politicians have been quoted today saying the bill won't pass.   


what if it's all a setup to have it pass unexpectedly for an ungodly pump?
Speculation
Break that $40 wall LCID
If you just bought puts, I think you might be fucked.
Thanks for making it go up
Lucid more valued than Ford now lmfao
If the supply chains collapse wont that cause a market crash before next quarter earnings?
Looked at lcid this morning at +5% but was like. Too high . This is a fukin gamble 🤡
Puts on LCID

Calls on TSLA
AMZN earnings, AAPL earnings, Infrastructure bill vote. They look great to me.
Bought a contract expiring tomorrow strike 42 for Lucid, sold an hour later just now for 400% return
Come on $40!
Rip
Yurrrrrrrrr
She has 2 boyfriends
I got some fds I'm pretty excited for that. Hope it keeps climbing
$LCID tickling my ballsack with 40.00
Y’all dumping Spy later, right? Looks too flaccid trying to keep up.
Who was that?
IM SHORTING TSLA
LCID is insane, glad its a third of my portfolio!
Just waiting for the LCID ticker suspension lol.
AMD hit support 6 times today. Not a triple bottom. A double triple bottom. 

Time to load up on calls.
Glad I fomo'd into lcid!
Me too! Up like 20% on the day. Now
I just don’t know if I should sell laid
Just out off times today! Usually I do my home work my self.

Why LUCID jumping?
You gotta stop holding your phone upside down
No but you just added to the name dropping.
I’m ready to end it all
LCID 🚀🚀🚀 to the moon!!!
Whatever I make on this NKLA fd, that's the Halloween candy I buy. These kids might be eating Lindoor truffles
IM HIGH AF ON LCID FUCK COCAINE SERIOUSLY
I don’t see it going down majorly until after earnings, and you’ll get IV crushed if you options hold until after
Ocgn review is next week. Going to continue climbing and the review may be favorable.
How bigs her dick?
I’m not putting any money into DWAC but I have a strong feeling we haven’t seen the top of it yet.
Are bears gay?
Holy fuck lucid I’m gonna cum

Alright well so I put $300 into LCID calls last night and just sold for $6,000. Guess I'm done for the day idk
Looks at GME... almost back to where it opened yesterday.
I drove by the Lucid factory on Sunday...AMA
Imagine not buying lucid a few weeks ago
Lucid is squeezing lol ngl
Fake n gay spy dip
LCID cars look twice as nice as Teslas so it has to be worth twice as much

BA to 285, AMD to 108, NVDA to 207. TA checks out.
At least for today and tomorrow.
Buy lcid puts at the end of the day?
Do people still trade options?

Happy Thursday
Most consumer spending is fueled by credit now. Personal income dropped bigly when the UI benefits rolled off. The effects should show in company earnings by the next quarter... then reality sets in that the earnings pump over the last year was basically a temporary phenomenon, and everything is severely overvalued lol.

Big tech will still do well cause cloud stuff is mostly fixed/required spending
All of a sudden my office has The distinct smell of like, Chuck E. Cheese. Plastic and pizza and air freshener.

Also some twitter guy with a following mentioned it was one of most heavily shorted stocks under 10$.
Even with 280% IV if this thing does a thing, shit will still print
Jumping back into options — what’re your hot takes/recs?
KEEP CLIMBING NIO!!
feels like even more wild/bullish than Feb for LCID given now the market fully knows its valuation but still buying into it
Selling shits, totals sales $95,000 and valued at $5B ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Up $7200 on my LCID shares
[deleted]
I sold my 11/5 TDOC $142cs two days ago, along with my 10/29 TSLA $1050cs. Just fucking kill me.
This lucid run up is amazing
People trying to catch knives right now.
Spy gonna go up a dollar before EOD.

If spy could stop shutting my gains away, that'd be great
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/ravensgators (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 971.1754999999999 when it was 1022.29 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
My ass been rolled.
Made $1800 off Tesla and LCID calls to make up for the $1500 loss I took on SPY puts I bought yesterday at close. Going in for 150 LCID shares to ride the wave up and sell at open tomorrow
Sell 28c Buy 37c?
GME yearly chart is a straight line to tendie town, higher and higher lows
I had 3 lucid 30c I sold yesterday for 67 why am I so shit
Those 10/29 Spy $460 not looking so good anymore
Same bro. Literally my rent money during lunch. Wack
XOS is the ev play you want…$5 and they have truck contracts w Amazon
I bought the wrong fucking car company today. FML
Ty bb ILY
With 0 Day trades I decided to sell 10x 36C against my 32C.
This is why I can't have nice things or get a 10 bagger.
Consumer spending in sharpest turn down since 2020 recession amid supply chain crisis..... markets green. The fact that the market is so disconnected from reality is concerning. When the bubble bursts its gonna be so fucking bad

Yes
Dam 100 bagger on lucid 36$ calls
Go look
poor little MO getting the belt today
What are they selling?
Already one step ahead of you 🤑
If you exercise an option you bought today, is it a day trade?
They're still not profitable and volume has been dogshit so as much as I would love to see a jump to $7-8 I'm not holding my breath.
Just going to let LCID ride until tomorrow at this point. pretty sure were going to wake up with it over 55
Lucid dreaming...
me too but look at all the sweeps coming in . it MIGHT have the same run tomorrow
[deleted]
LCID bringing GOEV up as well! GO Go Go!
Ocgn atleast 11 eod
Cmon FB get ur shit together
AFRM will get a blowjob on AMZN’s earnings call
Couldn’t resist throwing $200 at a LCID call. Highest daily volume ever
end is nigh y'all
Hmm. I don’t *feel* trapped.
So this is just the lucid thread now, right?
Earnings season baby!
Wtf was that?
They’re delivering cars on the 30th
Nah I’m fooling man. I’m just saying they’re good picks and wanted to be inflammatory about it.
LCID MVP of the day😎😎😎

Haha more like T🌈
I sold LCID 20 min ago right before it started running again I’m the worst trader ever lmao
hey only down 70% on my icln leaps now, neat

ADD MORE INK!!!!
I thought Lucid was just a dream but now I see it woke up along with me
Amazon and apple gonna beat, SPY will rocket and these 460c will print.
If LCID hits $100 I'll be able to afford one of their cars, but that is just dreaming
Although I never invested in it, Upstart has 1500% gains this year.
SPY shitting itself.
Bulls are trapped
The same shenanigans like yesterday…
NKLA up 7% because of this shit from Motley Fool

Buy puts it'll down to ground soon ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
LOL I told you guys... I bought the calls, so get your puts ready.
I am totally all in on it and keep buying. Want to be rich.
the synth? you don't like wsb synth? it's you that's wrong.
Fuk you spy
**MEGA GREEN ON NIO**
remember that time during covid that wsb mocked some noob from buying leaps on F when it was like $7/sh because he looked at what happened in 2008 and expected the same bounce back?

an ultimate reverse wsb moment.
Great success!
Lcid loading up to 40! Just shaking out somenpaper handed bitches
My boy LEV smokin shorts
popeyes tendies for lunch
What did he say now
SPY is slipping bc I bought calls for next week. My b
sold my LCID calls for 5x. LCID might go up even more but fuck it. i cant handle the stress now.
Don’t say this shit to me man. Those actually look like good picks and I’m gonna buy them and they’re gonna flame me
You are a retard. My comment was suggesting that you don't understand how market cap works. When TSLA was $30 (pre-split), it was **not** valued at $50 billion (Lucid is...). TSLA's valuation at $30 was much lower than LCID's.
I rode LCID from it's early pre-spac days and sold at $50. Was going to buy back in until i read the DA and pipe volumes. I think you get turbo fucked by dilution. Thought about buying again at 18. What I'm saying is, I'm retarded.
Msft and amd better pullback a little bit. I have kids to feed!
I would rather play in a ball pit filled with AIDS needles than spend one more minute listening to the WSB chat.  Sounds like an audio version of Smooshie Cookie.
Not bullish on that earnings report?
me too bro. i’m up so much $ after losing so much on gme
AMD getting mutilated 😭
That’s what I wanna know
okay i don’t wanna be this guy but is lucid setting itself up for a gamma squeeze? there’s massive OI on ITM calls and the farthest strike out is only 42
My average cost in Lucid is in the teens still. I believe
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon 
Little boy SPY jumped over the moon
Yikes. Look out spy. I think we end red today.
I am the Rain Man of day trading. Very retarded. Very rich.
HERE IS YOUR FREE ALPHA IF TSLA HOLDS IT WILL MAKE YOU RICH

Only kept one runner but still one of my best trades lately
Man do I love money

Pullback is good, I don't see how it doesn't hurt 40
Compared to this professional, high level dialogue?
LCID $40 EOD?, yes it can! 🚀🚀🚀
SPY you fucking bitch you better hitch a ride up to $465
baba calls on the menu again?
I sold 40 at $29.95 this morning like an idiot. Still holding 50. If it dips back down to 30 eventually I’ll probably load up more but it’s nearly at $40 rn so I might be waiting a while for that 😂
hard resistance apple at 153 - 165 tomorrow
Lucid deliver car to customer, stock happy
Do you even trade?
#Ban Bet Won

/u/thesippycup (2/0) made a bet that LCID would go to 35.0 when it was 27.63 and it did, congrats gigabrain.
That’s what I’m hoping for. This drop has to be manipulation
Sitting on 500 shame shares @ $5.39 average. Just selling covered calls till I break even then dumping this shit.
wow LCID doing its best TSLA impression
LCID 35c was a 45x bagger if you bought it today , I'm not even taking advantage of this retarded market right now when people are chasing EV for the quick PnD , same goes for every other meme stock
Thanks for dinner LCID
Why is LCID up?

You wish bubba! I bought in the 40s sold in the 130s , bought again in 55 ….. it’s tough been this apesh!

He likes to tongue them feet I see

Yeah Lucid is gonna keep this up until tomorrow at least, if nothing else it has enough people talking about it

Who else has lcid 40c?
[deleted]
So go all in pltr now ?

Unironically I'm pretty sure LCID is getting squeezed. 56 million shares shorted.
Hertz is now getting 150k Teslas to rent to Uber . 1420.69 next
Amazon often sends me duplicate orders, so I get more than one of what I ordered for free. Some sort of glitch. As a shareholder, I’m concerned, yet as a consumer, I’m happy. The value I get from the orders has been more than I’ve received through holding the stock this year.
Do you have at least 2k in your account? Your account also needs to have margin enabled
🙋‍♂️
Switching to cash gang, good luck retards
AFRM FD’s!!! - way up. Calls on GREED

Ima claim theta gang as a dependent on my taxes.
Wouldn’t we all agree that instead of buying puts or calls on LCID we can simply do Call credit spreads and simply take advantage of those overpriced premiums
Evergrande down -94% so far. Come on there's 6 points to go
NIO with the green candles baby! 🚀
getting back to the good old days of 2020 where any ev stock makes you rich whether they actually make cars or not

I’ve been on a losing streak for the last 2 weeks. So go figures the first time since I actually make 100% return is on a LCID $42c 1 DTE lotto but I only bought one.
imagine not understanding market cap
I’m gonna need to see you FD retards gain porn
36 support is powerful
LCID volume looks like DWAC a couple of days ago except they actually have something to sell.
Well we did give tax cuts to spur job creation and most of it went to stock buybacks instead so IDK what to think
Haha Nice play man!  

I’m about ready to go 500% with EO charging when they announce US fleet charging business deals.
Lmao yes it does? You just press the minus sign on your order flow on ToS

Ok serious question .  Time for puts on LCID?
Clothing is the entire business tho. It’s about renting designer clothing, that costs thousands of dollars. Yes, this does matter
Tesla first quadrillion dollar company, largest landowner on Mars.
sold LCID 40c covered calls when it was $9 OTM

now $4 OTM

fuck you i'll keep rolling it out reeeeeeeee
Probably the right choice
Think?
POOMP IET LCID
Almost a 5 bagger on Lucid leaps I want to hold out for the elusive 10 bagger but it’s getting harder and harder

$NOVA looks like she knows how to have a good time
I'm a newbie when it comes to stocks, so I've learned from a lot of you guys here. Just got my first big win from LCID, it's just 28 shares but we all gotta start somewhere right? 

So I'm kinda happy today fellas.

Ok fine, I’m getting out of my position for a nominal profit of like $12. I think you’re right.
Anyone going in on fb calls for their event?
Just hopped into the live chat for a sec.  What a cluster 😂
up 120% on boomer LCID shares
After the merger I valued Lucid shares in the high 30s to mid 40s. It got way oversold.

This is really just the beginning.
I wonder how many times FUBO can get rejected at 30 in a week

C'mon FUBO bulls, we gotta break that resistance
SBUX is screwed China is the 2nd biggest market for them. Even if they pull earnings numbers miracle forward guidance will be bad. Bought puts because I like money.
Wawa stole every good idea they ever had from Sheetz
so.. wen puts on Lucid?
dude went on to pump nwinf, talk about his chinese pumps and left
As Muir explains via some broker pals in the know, all U.S. mutual funds must have an October year-end, and a settlement lag made Wednesday the last day for any transactions to be included in that 2021 tax year.

LCID retest of 36 on high volume....lets see...well that was fast.
can't believe robin hood doesn't sell this naked wine crap
They’ll beat but supply chain issues will hurt guidance and tht will outweigh the positives. Plus if it goes below 3320 I get fucked, so it’ll definitely aim for that
KEEP THE PRINTERS RUNNING!!!!!
Calls. Seriously
Do you have something to add?  I don’t. Interesting listen though.

Seriously lcid is getting to 40,
It’s strange how “trust me, I’m a doctor” is one of the few lies that you’re really not allowed to say in almost any context

good to know. everyone loves allbirds so I think it’s a solid choice.
LCID is gonna explode! 🤯 crazy volume!
I will be very sad when amazon dumps after earnings and I throw away my gains
Paper handed bitches 

But hey at leaat you got profit
Lucid might dead ass run to its February highs before earnings
RIP to your account
Lucid about to blast thru 36, watch how long it tests before

That's a very aggressive and not very informative answer. Liquidity is a much better way to explain it. I appreciate your passion, but I don't find any value in your hostility. Dismissing all the drama, you didn't add much. But hopefully my question, which you didn't deem worthy, has attracted enough valuable answers that even you can learn from the responses from posters like /u/BagSelect and /u/LevitatingTurtles. I know I did.

If I sell Lucid now I get a month’s rent from just today’s gains… ahhhh
Hopefully we can see 40 on lcid this week or beginning of next . Gap fill from 45 to 50 on the yearly
Damn the $1080 wall is tougher than I thought
LCID is a stock to hold forever and then buy some yatch and shite
Clov earning on the 8th. Probably get a decent bump,
Wow lucid bull volume keeps going
Calls?
What a story.
Monday I think. Or tomorrow. Not sure. I accessed the IPO through RH
Looks decent but Apple didnt screw over their ad revenue which PINS is purely dependent on; puts all day
DKNG to 60 by thanksgiving. thats the play
Bought LCID puts too early.  Every freakin time
I wanna say its priced in already shes high enough

spy calls eod every week
What's the play right now.
what’s the most retarded thing you’ve seen so far?
TSLA a cock tease just burn already so we can load up on calls
not risky, ezpz
Is it really?  That may be worth it.
elon needs to tweet about lcid and trump needs to tweet too
Wow! LCID is a great buy! With a revenue of 174K and an earnings of -261 Million reported Q2 21’ ! 🤡
CHWY 90c
Idk about a hundred, but $50 by this time next month seems inevitable. $100 eoy maybe?
It's hittinf 40 man
Was thinking about grabbing pltr puts but then thought I should inverse myself so I went with calls. Sometimes I should inverse the inverse of my move
They also want to fund a climate change agenda by taxing the one CEO that's actually doing something about climate change...
Clean just don’t  but it directly under your ass hole because that would be kinda gross to use after
been hearing that every quarter for like5 years. i just been buying shares as i can and watching them roll.  Been buying since $400 was "too expensive"
Ok guys, i sold.  Tesla can go to 1100 now
I think it’ll dip at 3 imma drop my puts too and grab a call
He meant sell puts duh

Why is this anchor from CN*C not in prison? He is pumping a stock up +44%. This market is so rigged!
SPY wasting time now.
Nothing left to do now but keep buying the PYPL dip until i'm rich or go broke.
Lcid retard strength. I paperhanded a couple k I could have diamond handed. Don't be me
When can I start buying?
Ruh-0
In the wise words of JPow: fuck your puts
Keep an eye on lucid volume,  it might just keep going, naked wines up 40%
I say puts but I’m retarded so idk
So the company pays 1%? To who?
In for 200 spy 460p 11/5
Guh
ima need a reminder on this
Wen LCID SPY inclusion
Means PUTS are the move
Yep.. I'm pretty much going all in on V MA PYPL at this point /shrug.
CHPT starting to make breakouts along with other EV plays
Don't sleep on lcid, it's only began
Not risky but OCGN
You don’t know what puts are do you
Not too bad, I’m in warrants so the % is ugly. I got in Monday morning, stayed up all night and watched my position double. Fell asleep ~5am before I could sell and woke up at break even. That was genius. Still holding.
Ready for 1100
whenever i think wsb is retarded, i always check yahoo finance conversations page to see there are bigger retards
Ive got some 65c 11/5. Hoping for a nice pop.
It's actually a legit green day where most stocks are green. Very rare occurrence these days.
Is there anything more safe than PINS puts? Seriously
AAPL puts or calls before close? Can't make my mind up
Depends but it’s nice to only buy a drink or two at bar and sip as opposed to buying all there. Save dat munny
If you win it you’ll just owe more taxes

Does bidet-ing myself in the shower with the shower head make me gay or just clean?
Steel dump all at the same time. My calls are getting spooky 👻

The industry is doing well. NKLA is not dead stock, they still have a chance. I am not a shareholder, though.
FCEL doing great today 7.50 calls way to go
Anyone buying the dip on TWLO?
SGMS has a $7.7 B market cap and just sold its lottery division for $6.05 B. The stock dropped 15%. 🤡 market
Already up 30% on my 11/5 put
Inverse me then, i’ll see you at $460
Do it and post pics
You missed VIAC.. Maybe..
Were they holding a gun to your head forcing you to buy?
LCID back on its PAHMP
In this earnings environment I would probably get Apple calls tomorrow after earnings. Almost nothing is mooning. Microsoft only got a few % even. AMD- killed it and it’s down. Same might happen to AAPL.
That's a great point.
Or lcid. It's going to better than tesla and a steal under 35
ICLN is back baaby
I saw that this morning when I saw the first spike it was 116k
PLUG &amp; OSTK looking spicy!!!!
You saying this makes me feel better about my 11/5 454p’s

Wtaching the TSLA 1100c I sold for an 800 dollar loss go even. Will probably watch them triple before going long on rope
Who else has ABBV calls for tomorrow morning?
whoever told me to buy volta, i will find you
SPY is really having a hard time remembering what it’s supposed to do today, give it some words of encouragement.
Bought more pre market this morning. Call it a pipe dream but if it hit $100 I'm paying cash for a new car lol
Wondering the same thing. Torn between seeing this through and selling for some major gains today. I think it will go down some in the coming wks. But if u hold long enough it will go up a lot over time. guess it’s short term or long term gains
Tsla 1100 here we CUM
Absolutely $160 tomorrow on a positive earnings reaction
Tell me more good sir
Big Musk fan here don’t get me wrong, but TSLA puts anyone? 🤔🤔🤔
Shoulda bought lucid calls this morning. 20 bucks could have been 150 Rn
For funsies
You want some more good plays? 

Coinbase 350 and after ER it will be 400

Affrm 200 if amazon beats n moves 3600

Upstart after ER 450

Uber 50 after ER


90% out of this works
what stock they pumping?
That's always a valid reason 😂...was just wondering if there was anything else
I honestly didn’t think LCID would keep climbing 🤭
Have a bunch of short term realized gains that I don’t want to pay taxes on. What’s the riskiest $50k bet I can make before eoy
Bidets are the best thing in the world. Calls on Joe Bidet
You’ll be waiting a long time lol

The fuck, NKLA still trading? How?? What a scam
Angry about missing out of tesla?

Now is your chance to redeem yourself with a superior company about to take off
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp

I mean it's complicated so Google would explain it better. Both ATM calls and puts are used in the calculation
He believed there was a free money field pervading the Earth that could only be harnessed by Tesla calls
How heavy are the bags? 

Halts are fun eh
Puts on apple? people buying other phones due to increased delivery wait times? Feelin gay
Hopefully this spy rally has nothing to do with infrastructure because any chance at a vote today seems to be crumbling.
End of day dump?
I get drunk before I get more drunk
My call debit spreads are down 150% how tf
the call volume on LCID is disgusting
Gonna put $1k on allbirds IPO. Gf works in the hospital. Literally everybody wears them. Docs. Nurses. Patients.
Let's pump
It appears I’m a RDBX “investor” now
Well yeah but that can apply to everything else
This type of talk makes people not buy
Hmmm do I buy the apple calls?
Idk about that bud
The Biden administration is proposing a 1% surcharge on stock buybacks. This is dumb as fuck
this amzn run is not good for my mental health
How much do you guys drink to pregame? Enough to get buzzed or what

Why did NKLA break out today? Just so it could roll back downhill?

Lets gooo TSLA
Aapl fds. Tim apple show me what you’ve got

Took my biggest loss ever in spy calls yesterday. That sell off will haunt me for months.

They deliver the 30th*
Lcid about to hit 35
Lucid ripping again
Bought 100 PYPL shares for my boomer account and then proceeded to buy a few long calls. Trying not to overthink this one
Buying tqqq dips is free money
I think Tesla 1080 represents Stalingrad for the shorts
even this triple top on the NASDAQ is bullish
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
3 out 5, happy.
How are those guys from CN*C not all in prison sucking old smelly cocks? Biggest pump n dump channel that exists. NWNF +22% up within seconds.
Because it’s a pathetic company
💀
For LCID, this is the final invitation to buy below 35. Once we pass 35 and shorts are squeezed, we will ride on train of no return
[deleted]
You even get a $7500 tax credit if you buy a Lucid. Even Joe Buyden loves LCID.   Be patriot support  american companies.
facebook connect keynote at 1pm
Nice.
Some retard said my dd for netflix and tesla is stupid. Laughed like crackpot.

He invested in fb ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
when LCID actually sells a vehicle I'll be interested.  Just another shady SPAC with legal troubles promising the moon.

If you want to play EVs play Tesla.  Tesla gains make LCID look like pre-school.
&gt;Is this AMZN earnings run up or there's room to run AH?

Last earnings AMZN hit its 3530 resistance line  and 2021 peak was \~3700 so there is plenty of room for runup at this point.
Wouldn't you like to know
Sold my calls at $34. Tryina figure out my next move on this one.
I just sold when it hit 34 .. hopefully the peak . If not I’m fine with the big profits 

No justification for it to have a 24% jump in a day becuase they are delivering their first cars end of the month
i bought tsla 11/5 1100C. am i fucked
uh, zoom out and look at a 1 month chart and ask why it's going up.
They have one job.. make planes that fly and can’t even do that
[deleted]
GitLab up 4.22% not baddddd not badd especially considering I bought it an hour ago when it was like -0.7% so math roughly checks out to 5% gain on $10k in an hour
Meh don't care if it sells @ 11. I'll make another 7k off it lol.
I understand TSLA bulls saying 'its a software company' and making pie in the sky predictions to justify the current price.

Using car sales only to justify this price...is certifiably insane.

Oooh look at me, I'm AmeriMan, me bonobo-mode. OOK OOK AAH AAH
I’d take enough to lock some form of profit and ride the earnings. Expected to be good but shit doesn’t make sense anymore
I like LCID but I missed the boat so I got poots for when it pulls back.
Confession.. I sold right before the AMZN breakout
Cause I bought calls yesterday
OCGN finally waking up. 11/03 gonna be blast off after the WHO review.
I mentioned these crackpots tesla netflix google and msft like 3 weeks back 



I also said if fb twitter failed google ad business will be up. Retards called me stupid
Now everyone wants to know why I just randomly laughed
I would sell, watch it until 30 mins from close. Not my money though
Can you roll them out?
You mean 2018? There were many dudes who thought that

Me too bro, need to get out of this rabbit hole
Ameriman is an actual bonobo who thinks GME is PLUNGING to $100. CRINGE
Looks like my lunch time puke and the market puke were correlated today
There’s a 3% chance that you’re a statistical illusion.
And LC if you had it yesterday
$BA rebound I want flyyyy
15k into BLNK I see upside
Any Earning play comrades?
Shut up idiot
I tried to give myself two days before I had to steal the Declaration of Independence but visualmod said it wasn't bold enough so here I am hoping for a miracle.
your plays look stupid. All in $TTCF and thank me later
Yes there's a biological device evolved for their purpose. Your arms and hands can be used to support the toilet seat until it is close to closed.
I did.   and I really, really, really hope you are right.

Poor guy
Close, GM secretly stole his ideas and burned them otherwise Cybertrucks would have stormed Normandy.
This spy yolo will print insallah
Recently made 4 grand off of DWAC. Using the money on TSLA calls. This will either make or break my trading career
AMAZEon just broke out. 4000 incoming.

Yeah, there’s slow close toilet seats.
More people jumping on puts when they see TSLA go up.
Who's buying $155 Aapl FD YOLO calls for tomorrow
Other than LCID, pretty boring day

Are you fucking brain-dead retarded? Only like 2 brokers do fractional shares. You obviously don't have the slightest grasp on options either, or you would see the implications there. You don't belong. Get the fuck out. Ban.
🙋‍♂️
remember it's up to mama
Just gotta wait til 3:50 and sell all of em and load up on calls to sell at open
Tesla scared of 1100
Never hitting 200 again

Look at lcid, you can get 5 shares for then price of 1 gme and lcid will actually be profitable
Honestly seems like it’s only a matter of time
I played all of it
I'd be up $2300 if i kept my AMZN play but I instead bought the PYPL dip. Feels great man.
Lmao
Does anybody know why AMD is going down?
Sold some TDOC calls for profit and then entered into some PRLB calls...been bleeding for 10 months, gotta stop eventually right?
Get a soft close toilet seat. Or shit at someone else's house
Just buy a plastic toilet seat dumbass
so much in AMZN. so tempted to take gains on some of these March calls that I rolled into yesterday
Predictions for amd? I have 11/19 145s looking to tell on a spike but guess thats over
I'm guhna
Doing the responsible thing and taking some profits on a couple major outperformers. I feel like this is the first step on the way to dividend investing.
Do it bro. Even when they crush earnings they dip after.
Hey DWAC-ERS Buy LCID its AMERICAN made...BE a fucking patriot.
AMD back to being a piece of shit
Wym?
I bought tqqq puts yesterday. That was fun
I’m hoping for $4,400. You saw Microsoft earnings?
Yes, these exist. Make a trip to home depot.
Why are u doing this to yourself
Heavy on it
They definitely have toilet seats with a mechanism that slows it down. Similar to how some doors have a hydraulic arm so they can’t be slammed.
I didnt know Nikolai Tesla created a fortune 500 company before he died
Was around 3 yesterday I believe
Yeah I have a slow close lid at home
Do it 🌈🐻
I wonder how many people in here missed all of the following plays TSLA GOOG MSFT DWAC LCID TQQQ etc
Some of the permabulls on here get more satisfaction from owning the bears then they do making money.
Fuck brother, I have the are you trading emotionally questionnaire in my phone for these yhings
Jan 6 🇺🇸 Freedom Fighters bought DWAC at $170+....sold at $53.....then bought it back today at $76
If u told Tsla yesterday then good. You don’t deserve it
Bought some puts on $AMC and $GME to help you guys out. 🚀
Lcid
Ahahaha
msft went up on earnings therefore appl will go up tmrw
I think Bezos is right philosophically… but I also think that (for example) one of elons strategies is to get people to buy puts and short his stocks to level up via short squeezes.
I'd be so wet if that happened
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

It was announced today that IMAQ is acquiring Reliance Entertainment. But that's not important, what's important is that Nancy Pelosi's son is on the board of IMAQ. 🚀🚀💸💸💸?
Bad idea
Down
What time is the SPY rug pull? Asking for a friend.
Somebody talk me down.. I almost just bought AAPL puts
Probably implied vol spiking, usually volatility is inversely correlated to stock movement, especially when the moves are huge.
Probably should have sold $12 calls …. Lmao
#35,666 DJIA 👹 B warned!

TSLA fib clear as day. 1200 tomorrow
My favorite way to buy stocks lol
I've never been so excited for a stock dropping as I am on F, literally making back the losses on my 15.5 puts with 17 puts I bought at the top today. Go ber Zach!🌈

JBLU is following the same old flight plan -- touch down at $14 for a few minutes then head back up towards $15 and beyond.
It’s pretty easy. You just pick the stock and the date you want to look at and you can see the values for the whole option chain on that date. I think it only shows the value at close though.
[deleted]
$AMZN please announce a split 😫
I was thinking puts at 35 but it might hit 40
Imagine thinking losing $40 aint much but then you realize you dont have a job anymore
Sauce bro
Today looks like OCGN  might be perfect for that. High volume. Increased IV. So selling that IV should work out unless it squeezes.
Fuckkk look at lucid
mrna also painful
If it hits way until next week. Market direction all depends on how aapl and Amazon perform
Hertz buying another 100k teslas? Lmaoo
Aapl after earnings
I'm getting trade deal is 99% complete vibes
Imagine thinking Ford was gonna actually go to $18 today 🤡😂
At a Canadian airport
bntx is painful
oh i definitely can
Don't. Sell a cash secured put instead. You'll get the underlying cheaper than you would have if assigned. If you don't get assigned, then you make money regardless! If assigned, then sell covered calls.
$AMD slow landing to $114

I need $230 at expiry for breakeven. Was up over 100% a couple months ago lol. 220/250 spread purchased about a year ago now down 25%
That's a stupid idea
Google it there should be a good announcement coming 11/3
Who needs profit when you have NFT?  But unironically.
COIN gave away the whole 5% gain of the day, still 313$ seems to be some kind of support
Squeak!! 🐀
Just sell naked calls on TSLA or AMD.
Many fractional shares buying and selling still only adds up to 1 traded share on the order book.  A split introduces more shares to trade, so it improves liquidity.
Stop trying to win the lotto. These people who risk their life savings only show you their proudest moments. Not the endless misery. 

Aim for good days, not great days.

AFRM hitting 170 then 200 very soon. Their forward guidance does not include Amazon, Target, Walmart and American Airlines. Think about that.

#OR ELSE!
what is FD money?
Leo Dicaprio is all in VLTA!!! Perfect Wolf of Wall Street meme stock !!
Its a steal at this level IMO
What announcement bro. I just bought in from the volume spikes alone.
LCID is just ridiculous.
Some idiot at Bofa saying nok will go down : down 4%.

Says they made a mistake : nok up 2%

Nok earnings beat, despite chip shortage : nok up 0.5% 

Wtf is this?
Explain then
WSB is live.. wtf is going on there…
AMZN is a cowards play. Why would you not invest in a company that is at ATH already then picking one that lagged behind?
😂
I’ve been hurt many times by this stock, but it’s 100% my portfolio lmao. Pray for the best prepare for the worst

https://imgur.com/a/n1sfseG
😱 I sure hope not!
Have 16k to put into a stock to sell CCs on...any suggestions lol?
So AMZN will be 3000-3200 tomorrow. Got it.
I sell GME puts to pay rent. gonna say lower middle class tho. I still feel dirty about it. and even dirtier that GME is listed in my portfolio.
I was down 90% then all in lucid back in early October and it was worth the wait lol

TSLA here to just thetacuck everyone today huh?
Yeah we're in too deep now man
Picked up a few LCID puts for next week
[Only one I see on that chart.....](https://i.imgur.com/iJhZhDU.jpg)
their guidance is gonna be shit though mark my words
My entire portfolio is now EVs and green energy. Biden's America.
Barry White agrees
LCID put, engage.
I play both sides but I always find it cringe when bulls say bears are fucked. Have u checked volume last 2 weeks? There’s no one shorting atm

A repeat of yesterday and you can retire.
you sure it’s gonna tank? looking strong as hell right now. I see it going up at least $20 more.
That falling wedge on SPY going down only lasted 15 days and now is breaking all time highs what
That might be an argument against splits. ;) Bezos always talks about wanting owners not renters. But I appreciate the answer. Thx.
Holding TLRY feels like waiting to board a flight that keeps getting delayed.
i am down 63 dollars
Are we gonna get a 1% drop to end the day?
I think it's gonna run up one more time BIGLY tomorrow, then crash again. I was in at 28 out at 94 but only a poor amount of shares
Damn can PayPal really take a shit. Impressive
isn't 5x buyers good for calls?
Buy the Brandon dip !!!
Let’s go DIS let’s get a quality facerip for old times sake, go back to the absolute animal you were in 2020
Thanks. I'll try that.

No volume
Shit has a high PT of $5,000
Good sector, but too much debt with an impending interest rate hike to be something I want to hold now. Maybe if it dips 10% or so.

I’m feeling pretty gay rn. Loaded up on puts
At least 10 mil
You're kidding yourself.  Theae puts are printing as i watch it bleed out
F pulling a GM from yesterday morning, EOD price predictions.
Thots on IBM OTM calls
SNAP making me happy, yes zaddy
Ocgn $12 by open?
AMZN is going to 3800 afterhours.   whether it stays there by morning is a very different story.
True
You think they aren’t?
You don’t even understand the implications of using the term ‘we’.

The dipshit apes are going to have all their shares locked up for an attempt at coordinating a stock pump.

It’s different if it’s a pool of people chaotically buying a lot of different securities.

But it’s beyond illegal when a large decentralized group collectively agrees to position individual investments in a coordinated effort.

Pooling all that into a fund and investing. Yes. Perfectly fine. Other than that? No
If you ain't out of your AMD positions at this point, idk what to tell you. Order book has 5X sellers than buyers. This won't be pretty.

Edit: words
How do you play the market when there's mass shortage everywhere?
GME will have another wave, im expecting 250 soon
God dammit I look away for 10 mins and my puts turned red
Lots of folks cant or wont buy amzn due to price and they cant get fractional shares
🐻 Called me dumb yesterday for buying calls. The color green doesn't have to hurt
It’s not hard to quit society just tells u it’s really addictive. Nicotine addiction takes like 2 weeks to end lol

Hop on the Lcid ship
gonna try and stop me?
If you buy under $40 you win the game
Amazon rly gonna gap up $100 before earnings and you all think it’s not opening $4,000+?
Degraded by Oppenheimer because the stock reached their targeted price. They only look at a GIA scenario and what the company is currently worth. 

Other analysts have provided 2 target, GIA or Buyout. Do not mislead people on what is happening.
VIX doesn't exist here pal
Why you wasting FD money of smokes and drinks?
Good idea
OCGN goin parabolic
You can if you have level 4 options
My RKT calls just started going green after being -$500 this morning, I'm always right but by god am I bad at timing the bottom.
It's got a 51 PE and a dogshit dividend and is getting sirupted left and right by buy now pay later schemes.  In order to grow into that valuation half the country would need to lever to the tits in high interest credit card debt.  There are much cheaper ways to take on debt now than visa.
splits going to get you there faster

Delta is fucking with my weeklies
Someone give me a reason to believe in my AMZN $4,000C 11/5 3 at 3.75
What the fuck PayPal.
VIX can’t even fall below 16 and yet we’re all bulls

are we all retard?
Nice
Dummy
What's the point of a split? It's all the same anyway, and now with fractional shares the argument that the "common man" can't buy doesn't hold for most stocks, (brk.a excluded). 

Is the idea that in a year or two people will "forget" it split and it will "reset". So today if x happens it goes up a dollar. Tomorrow after a 2-1 split if x happens it goes up 50 cents. But maybe in a year or two if x happens it will go up a dollar again, because the world sort of reset on to the new normal?

Otherwise I don't see any benefits, except I'll own 2 times as many shares that are half as valuable. I guess that could move someone into covered calls category if they previously had 50 and now have 100.
You morons are actually wasting 180 on gme, a dead meme stock?!

Jesus. You could buy 5 lcid at that price and actually take profit
I means IV still high until earnings
Second mortgage on LCID, gonna be rich
Do it bro I wont make fun of you. Someone's gotta put the bottom in
Are you retarded? Because that ass is special
I need to shit
I can’t believe nobody is making a play on $XOM. They have just increased dividends to $0.88 / share. Earnings come out this Friday pre market hours. Should be interesting to see how rising oil prices affected their earnings. I think $XOM is undervalued at $63 / share. It’s easily worth $74 / share.

Someone put half a mil on Amazon 5100 feb 22 calls this morning… 🤯
I'd go as far back as 1932 when the two modern political parties coalesced, but we're both in agreement that shit is fucked.  The exact time table of the "fuckening" doesn't really matter at this point.

EDIT: a word.
Don’t sell yourself out. You and I both know you can get that down to $0. You got this brother

AFRM buy now...pay later... we dont care about your credit!   AFRM is going up until they have the 2022 Q2 earnings (when everyone who started using it on AMZN has to start actually paying the bill).   Ride it.

whelp that's it for me boys. Haven't had a green day since NFLX rebound, [down 180k (70%)](https://imgur.com/a/DzAgH1Y) from this year's high. About 120k of principal. Couple good runs, but the last 30 days has been truly disastrous. Seeing the balance under 100k stings.

Glad this was all from stock payments from my company. Still sucks, but my salary is plenty to live comfortably on. Gonna let my remaining options ride for the day, cash em out, and put the settled funds into something dumb like SPY or AMZN stock in the morning.
I'm holding calls hoping for a bounce. Used to by my favorite stock in the world it honestly sucks seeing this

42 would be almost 50% for me but I just bought in a few days ago so I wouldn't be mad at all. Plus I'm all for supporting pharma that solves problems. Also in SAVA to see what happens.
Guy.

There is no “we”, never has been, never will be. Your money is your own.
Yeah, with the “think back” thing under “analyze” tab
Lmao. Swears

Democracy is taking from the successful to subsidize the unsuccessful? Sounds like appropriation to me.
Time to buy PLTR
Are we going to get another pump out of TSLA today? Or time to drop my 1100c?
Doesn’t change the fact that they are growing exponentially in the largest auto market in the world and are expanding outside of China within the next year

CHWY to the moonski
Whelp I disagree completely, VIAC hit $100 and has been holding support at $35 for over half a year. It is ripe.
Didn’t say it wasn’t but their market cap compared to $NIO is not justified.
Tried to scalp PYPL. Got fucked
Wake and bake for sure
spy or amzn calls
The game is rigged
So how fucked are my 3/2022 $V calls?
It’s 52 week high is 18 bozo..
Where spy going by eod 🤔

Of all my huge options plays that have paid bigly, I’ve always started down AT LEAST 10-20%

Trust in your conviction 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Yeah man if only things where stable and people had nothing to worry about like when Cheeto Mussolini was president.
Inversing WSB is the play
SHOP level II looking real strange all the sudden, just a ton of 1 share orders on the buy side
$LCID is legit.
100% growth in revenue y/y. Cost side is a bit of a mess though. G&amp;A expenses ballooned a lot, not ideal but it won't stop the Cathie's of the world from buying the top line story

Ocgn yes. Phamp it
I’m off my lithium recently
I don't think most clothing would be valuable enough to count as an asset or a life long enough to make it worth tracking. What is the service life of a shirt you are going to rent out to multiple people? $100 over 10 years.... is it worth assigning and asset number and tracking it? 

Probably best to expense it. My business doesn't treat everything we buy as an asset for a reason.

Right ! It's just our dumb luck .you dont know how sad I get look at my call option I sold on monday for a nearly 1000 bucks just cuz of fear it wasnt gonna move higher and nkw its 7k .but nooo as long as I hold my new tsla calls theta stays fuckin me in the ass

I love when the press shouts questions when the speaker walks away, like he's going to suddenly turn around and give answers.
Beat top and bottom
Either $LCID is overvalued or $NIO is undervalued. No fucking way a company that is just about to start rolling our vehicles is only worth $10b less than a company that has been steadily increasing deliveries in the largest auto market in the world.
Take a break man 😂 stock market will be there tomorrow and every day after that, cash out and go get a nice steak dinner

PLTR is just never going to shed the tard from its name
Lol why you hating the players like they made the tax code or keep interest rates at record lows making it easy to avoid taxes…
Need Pelosi to come through with that spending bill 👀
How are we feeling about AMZN earnings? Have some debit spreads that I’m up nicely on and am considering closing. On one hand, I expect cloud numbers to be excellent, but I’m worried about supply chain issues being brought up in a negative context. 

Positions are 3445/3455 and 3470/3485

i disagree, an efficient market is one that never goes down (i learned this from the fed), so i would say this is the most efficient market in history where down days have been all but obliterated
Pay your fair share!
Probably using it to power the generator he’s taking with him for when the battery dies 🤷‍♂️

Anyone else playing it?
OCGN to 10.50

yeah well I damn near doubled my 'folio since Monday so F U C K I T
A quick look at the historical daily values indicates SPY moved within the same basic percentage change that it is now.  Only difference is that the underlaying share value is so much higher now.
say supercharger stations biden!
HT way down after earnings beat and upgrade from analysts. Scooping up more shares.
No u
Visa now back to pre-pandemic price. Wow

I just know if I sell this 10/29 TSLA 1070c right now it’ll probably go to $1100+ tomorrow
They said they are starting with premium pricing to establish a premium brand like Tesla did. Then working down to more affordable cars. Rich tech people love shit like this that’s why they only took like 500 reservations at $165k

Two years ago SPY moving 1 dollar a day was considered a volatile day, happened like one or two days each month at most.

Now SPY casually go up and down a few dollars basically every single day.
up close to 20k so far so if this continues it might actually be enough for a decent car lol
Personally I would give it a couple months. They took a major hit for good reason.
$700 to bet right now. Give me an option.
I keep seeing the same article stating the Zucc sold 45K FB shares, but that’s literally 0.01% of his holdings. Media FUD is out of control. FB 350 end of next week

Man, congrats to all the LCID bagholders! The question is can it continue to climb or is it destined to drop back to $30?

Why did you sell all of them?
Lmao if you think executives at publicly traded companies are analogous to pro sports players.

it's fun to see thetagang get fukd every now and then, sure a lot sold calls on LCID for that quick cash then watch the gains from the sideline after shares are called away
Any idea why WOLF stock is up 30%? Can't find any news about it.
One hundred, billion dollars.
Not for me.  Burritos and beer last night.

This guy gets it, take profits and buy an Audi e-tron.
People seriously still buying DWAC?
I feel u sold my 35c at .55 for quick 1000$ profits. Would make 28k now if held lol
Sell, it will tank for the next couple of weeks
buy another
#BULL GANG ON MEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!
Buy the call back.

Or invent time travel.
This is the top
2 billion now I think?
Too late I FOMO'ed in...
And how many EVs were there at the market at that time? You guys are retarded as fuck.
What did Biden say?
Depends.  What's your mom charge these days?
lol yeah 😎
We need to spend more money, tax only Elon and give to the poors
I can’t believe I got shaken early today. Bought qqq calls and the action shook me only for a 8% gain. Would’ve been a bagger if I just got past that iffy start smh
LIP SMACKER
PayPal you are better than this.  Elon was part of what started you.  Leave this abusive relationship with the 🐻 immediately and you go get better for yourself girl!
&gt; The LCID price will be driven up by the release of a new product called "LCID 2.0" that is expected to have superior performance over its predecessor.
It's a public GitHub code not a rumor.
This old fuking fuk tanked the market. But back to business. 459 eod!
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Scientist-Local (2/1) made a bet that TLRY would go to 12.12 when it was 11.595 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Im a long term holder for the dividend so all I really care about is what strikes and premium I can get on the CCs I sell, but it still pisses me off.
Engine no. 1
How do I reverse selling a call
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
BUY QQQ RIGHT NOW SELL AT 1:30 AND REBUY AT EOD
Please keep driving lcid price up… gonna make even more on my earnings puts
Spy giant red dildo wtf
🌈
I see no reason to ignore a moneymaker just because said stock also attracts cult-like behavior, but to each his own.
&gt; I am not sure what you are asking. Tesla is a company that makes electric cars and solar panels, so the same people who bought these products would be interested in buying shares of their stock at $80k per share.
Broke through all its moving averages....might stay away from this until it finds support
Thnx bbe
thats less than the first tesla roadster
Up 340% on my $30 strike lucid leaps. Need that 10 bagger before I sell though
SNAP leaps?
Calls have been ridiculous today
The same people who paid $80k for Tesla when they came to market
Yeah, that’s tough. I’m up 30%. It’s like you’ve been reading my mail
F your 🌈 🐻 homies
Amazon fucking SENDING, shit deff opening above $4,300+ tomorrow

Your homies are gay as hell.
Mo and weedstocks
Same here... I thought my $34 calls would be still OTM.  Didn't expect 25% gains in 1 day...
&gt; I don't care.
Told you fuckers this was priced in

Any of you retards even know what just happened with GME? Probably fucking not.
Holy LCID, sold calls
There are trillions of dollars in money market funds. The dip will be bought to infinity and beyond.
My crayons say this is a key level for SPY. Stay tuned for more useless information
Hertz is pumping its own OTC stock and TSLA lmfao

Nothin wrong with a little puss in the morning

Sold lcid 32c at .25 for +30%. Had i held it wouldve been 400% 🤓

Spy with the patented $1 move in 10 minutes
With your mentality, SPY would’ve been at $100,000 right now

SBUX my third winner in a row?? I must have finally stopped pissing off the Wall Street gods
Come on lcid, 

Anything under 35 is a deal compared to teala 1k per share
wtf are you holding everything is up today and also this year
I dont usually trust a stock that goes up 20%+ in a day, but Im not selling my LCID over short term fears. It's a long term hold for me. Disclaimer: I got in at $15
im in with 10k
Anything of note? At work rn
Biden! You know what to do 😎
Biden needs SAVA. Pump that shit Joe
SHCR on the move up...cheap options before it really jumps. Seems to be running with mango stocks because they have a deal with Mar Lago to provide software services
Got 50% of my Roth in FB now 🇺🇸🦅
That’s the real deal - if you buy the dip good luck and good speed
HOOOOLD THE LIIIIIIIINE
Killing me this year.  If they don't legalize pot im voting Republican.
Remember when ICLN was the best shit around?
Well I don’t have to set it to expire next week , it could be within 1 or 2 months
It would be more disaster
Do I really want to buy the amzn 1dte calls 🤔
SPY, wha happen?
buy the dip, buy the dip, buy the dip
Jerking off powell

Holy hell LCID goin parabolic
I was a bear but bulls have more fun so I’m going to ride this party until it dies and not look back.

No more puts
LCID has retard strength
I went all in to $COP yesterday since it dipped and now it’s doing down more. Am I a retard?
damn you need to find a job. health benefits are key
&gt; I am a millionaire. I hate poor people
Please keep talking about how shitty America is biden
Motivating speech, this...
For the hell of it I bought .00125th of a share $BRK.A It is up  $0.5246662 so far today....lol
It’s true you fucking retard, should i make a post? I am not proud of this . I want to be a millionaire
I wish I could say I’m surprised
I've held wish since IPO, so I'm not sure you really want my luck
Wth just happened
Now watch a bill related news “leak” and bring everything down again!
hopefully before new year so I'm not sucking cock for coal this christmas
How did you never hear of LCID before?
Infrastructure not “social infrastructure” - what’s he’s talking about now is “social infrastructure”. There’s bipartisan support on the already senate passed real infrastructure bill that’s waiting in the house
holy guacamole !!
Not unemployed but will be soon at the rate I’m not giving a shit
I’m bout to have sushi for breakfast fuck ya
Lucid air is a sweet ride
Lmao okay man you're nuts. Intel still holds majority market share for home PCs and laptops, and still commands a sizable ownership of the server and enterprise world as well. Dead zombie company? They're about to launch their newest gen architecture which shits all over Ryzen and probably will still be ahead of 3D Zen3 release too. The stock is being beaten down in an odd way and is still a major player in the tech world so you can't just handwaive it while saying all tech companies are mooning.

Got out of LCID too early, but got my 180% gain. Hope it keeps mooning for yall.
Too late already took the second mortgage on my house
Up 50% this morning and can’t contain myself
What’s Biden doing
Market stopped making sense a long time ago
I will not fomo into lucid.. Meaning it will continue to climb..
OH BOI WHAT WERE THAT
Wtf I just went all in SPY calls and out of nowhere SPY starts tanking.
Up 20k on LCID. F to the haters.
Truuu, hold over the weekend and hopefully their weekend deliveries are a success?
Uh oh. Lol.
I just bought 100 shares of some company I've never heard of because it curved up. Am I Full Retard yet?
U ain’t alone
knowing AAPL earnings it'll crash despite good earning lol
Dumpy spy call time
Bernie finna tank his own bill lmfao
Not sure if I should tempt fate and go for another Tesla call.
Yeah ever since I accepted that fact a while back I’ve been banking hard. I made so much It doesn’t even matter if it crashes because I’ll still be up lol. Only mad I didn’t accept this fact sooner.
#to all the FB fud spreading whistleblowers

Whistle blow deez nutz bitch
So I guess my accidental selling of GTLB the other day was a good thing…? I’m just gonna buy more. I think I might be able to today but with settled cash rules and buy sell buy I’m afraid to get a wash for no reason
Yawn

Ugh you should also do some toddler level DD on the last bond buying program.
Good bet
Take your weekly shower, primate.
If it keeps pumping you’ll hit max loss pretty quick

Lemme get a whiff 😩😩😩
all the important parts got denied already
Not buying before big earnings. But probably buying a few after Friday morning.  Fed next week. Economy slowing. Bill reduced in spending. End of massively positive earnings runup.  Time for a week or two of consolidation before the holiday runup.
They have a manufacturing problem to work out first.
Anyone else unemployed and just using stocks as the main source of gambling for money?
That's like a goto response for cultists. =|
Ight let me get my time machine

So it's when a red candle is completely within the range of a preceding green candle. I can see it on the daily today, from 9:45-10 am EST, so maybe they're just talking about the daily chart? Without Yahoo+ it's really hard to tell what they're talking about. I just find it humorous that such a large cap stock is flying this week and its Yahoo page is screaming sell signals lol.
Gonna need PLTR to hit 27 tomorrow

Yes I agree, just new to all this I guess, seems like it’s less of a bet for this one tho and more of just a waiting game
SPY will never go down. This mentality would have made you rich over the last couple of years. No reason to think it won’t continue
I have it here on tda. But it's.. comprehensive. You don't want "easy" options.

Going to roll my LCID earnings into AAPL earnings play. Godspeed.
Probably gonna take some profit from FB calls after the event and sink it into some late November NVDA calls. They are going to kill earnings in November.
STFU you cultist troglodyte!
Imma need FB to keep going vertical thanks
Here comes the retest of 34.
Picked up some FB at 312. It's free money at these levels.

Waiting for V to hit oversold on the Daily RSI (hopefully right around $200), and will pick some up as well.
Where do you see LCID in a year?
They were talking about it last week, and about 2/3 of the commenters were negative on it.  Until there is a website you can join, or something tangible they won't talk about it IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you should head over there and try to talk some of them into investing in DWAC, why wait for Trump to pump it?  Let me know how it goes, because I don't think it'll have the results you think.

NVAX has 20 billion in deals. Submitted to UK WHO and submits to Europe, Health Canada, Australia in next 5 days and expects FDA approval within 2 months.  NVAX also has all price targets above 270 and will be revised higher with approval.  Trading at 145.  When the 1st approval is announced in likely 4 weeks or less. This will be 250
Then on to 470

not a great look when MA is meeting its metrics while V is making excuses for its misses
Go back to the cult subs you inhabit.
LCID 111M volume, 4x avg, 70M short interest opened 27-30. They can't tolerate pain beyond 35. Gap to be filled 35 ---- &gt; 50
I bought in a while ago when it dipped as a long term trade. Got an avg cost of $22.95.  I do think it has long term potential however in the near term it wouldn’t surprise me if there’s a pull back
Man I hope your puts go to 0
Cortexyme CRTX 🚀

AMC is a good buy at 3.60 USD.
Sava should use that name for their drug
Thank's for the support ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)
Bears are confused.

But like why would anyone want to be a bear? It's so fucking stupid.
Fundamentally, the market goes up. Wtf?

Just you I have a watchlist of 30 plays I'm too poor to make
That’s an easy task
While everyone and their mom is green.   Visa decided to dip another 1% after yesterday 7% down.
Problem is I blew all my money before the real dip actually happens lmao
Roll it up. Turn it into a joint.

Well, it appears the bovines gettin' gassy again...
Oh, you meant since it was $10 NAV.. basically I bought warrants at a stupid low price and they cashless converted to shares leaving me a share price of $2.98 since I didn’t have to pay to exercise them for $11.50
That's because you're a pussy

Not today. Strong breakout on solid vol. I went with Dec 30c this morning as LCID was heading to $30. Doubled already, and holding steady.
buy strangles.... nothing moves
CLOV high of day 7.50 calls printing
Sell before close
uh, everywhere, look around
Yea but i think earnings we might see some run up like tesla. EV sector hot right now. Saw the news the other day that Saturday will be first lucid deliveries, it was trending yesterday on stocktwits, but yea still profits are profits
thought i was gonna get Gapped by GAP today, but tendies it is 😎
AMC is set to annihilate earnings expectations, seems like a good bullish swing play, anywhere under 36$ is a good dip buy. Last time it was in this range it bursted to 44$.
As well, there is a gap to be filled at 38$
rising wedge?
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/veryveryfloppydisk (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1100.0 when it was 1059.34 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
**Well I need to recover $400 with only $2,300 left 😔 f you spy I buy you go down I sell you go up WTF MANN**
Whats the play with the Biden talk?
Yep, had to close out my puts for smaller gains.
RKT is low?
Lucid sell limit at $300 LFG
Someone go wake up Branden. Bears are starting to lose patience for his speech
Naw the difference is the other companies have a vehicle that doesn't require gravity and a downslope to move
&gt; I think it's company-specific.
All I need is one big score and I'll get to unleash the wifes 80k into the mix. Her bf told me so!
Way too close to expiry for either of those.

Yall ready for SPY to tank tmw
SHCR running with mango stocks. Cheap options.
Buts it only 5B. Rivian is 80B. Tesla is 1T. So it’s undervalued. 

This is how you know it’s a bubble
Going to lose my ban bet. It was nice knowing you guys. I bet Tyson would go up like 3 percent and it went down 4 percent instead.

I'm only down $400 on $47,000 worth of FB stock, so I got that going for me, which is nice. Lets go FB!
Do your own dd. Make your own choices.
Tesla is literally just acting retarded

i rolled some Jan yesterday to more March

those are green so i might protect what lil gain by selling some far far OTM shit against them (3800c and 4000c)
VLTA making solid gains
AAPL expectations are for an inline to slightly better C3Q with more concern around C4Q guide given supply constraints, though AAPL stopped guiding to an explicit number.
LC and F. Yay!
Thnx budd that’s what I’m seein

Welp another bad trading day. I saw $LCID at $28 and almost bought 2k shares, would’ve been a great $10k flip. Loaded up on $SOFI calls Idc what happens now I’m holding until earnings. Got back in $DWAC at $69 for trump speech later hopefully this runs to $100
I can't believe I sold my TSLA back when it was $420.69 post-split just for the memes. Fuck I'm dumb.

Nice fanfiction
I'd say SPY might be due for a pullback if we were in the days of it not being green every day for no reason
I paperhanded my SHOP 1475c 10/29 call for a loss and now look it’s ITM
Am not okay
This was a huge breakout for LCID, they could now run to $50 as deliveries start

Also, LCID is speculated to get a multi billion dollar deal with Saudi Arabia as part of the Neom City development. Point is tons of catalysts for LCID this fall. Waiting for a red day then re-loading up on calls
TSLA wyd bb
Sadness settin in again...

6500 shares? Geez
Action points to another potential rip for LUCID then I’ll make my put entry
Shorts don't cover dumbass!
Long Coin 11/12 400 calls and Tesla 11/12 $1,500 calls
TDOC looking strong after all.  Kudos to all the folks on here who jumped on yesterday
That’s what I’m thinking what if I miss my chance?

I know the price to electrification number is huge Way bigger than all the other auto companies
big green day and AMD is red. my calls getting smoked
What dip
&gt; LCID is a dogshit company and it's going to be worth nothing in 5 years
Back to +1,000% on my LCID shares I got at $2.98 🤭🤭


I’m going hold them 15+ years for the ultimate yolo

You gonna close out AMZN before earnings or stick with it?
OCUGEN

...coming around the corner
yeah its only like 350 p/e go all in
If it was me, I'd wait for something to dip the price or when it's cooled off for a bit. But I'm a bargain hunter and patient.

The stock only makes up a small share of my portfolio because when I bought it 3 months ago, I saw it as a risky stock since it hadn't delivered a single vehicle. But I was smart to see $LCID with enormous upside.

If deliveries go smoothly and reviews of the vehicles continue to stay positive. The owners say the vehicles meet their advertised specs(beat TSLA), and the company beats expectations, I'm going to put a lot more into the stock.

That's just me though. I'm a more conservative investor and it's always good to do your homework before buying a stock.
LCID short covering starts at 35. 70M short interest opened between 27-30.
I just want to say fuck Palantir. I'm selling shit at the next dip because I want to drive the price lower.
How long do I have to wait to buy my V leaps
Sell or write some calls
TSLA should buy Fisker because Fiskers look nice.
Then Nikola is undervalued, it’s only 5B

WISH making me money, haters said not to buy at the lows  🚀 🚀 🚀
Rivian at $80B and Lucid at $40B? lol you know the undervalued stock here
I’m worried that I may never be able to buy Tesla at this price again. Thinking I should pull the trigger and go all in.
😂😂😂

Rip
I'm going to curbstomp myself if my GNUS contracts don't print in Jan.
LCID ❤️❤️❤️
Yeah, that was supposed to be mangos thing
I fear it would shit itself if poked.

originally was thinking red day but I am getting strong "the market liked what biden had to say" vibes and finish +1.2% kinda inverse result where the market cucks you for thinking it would be bothered by minimum corporate taxes, taxes on unrealized gains, etc.

Watch this LCID dip get ate up like the last turkey leg on thanksgiving.

Then buy puts, but we all know were this strategy ends
I can. I made five trades, 4 were winners and 1 was such a bad loser it set me to red
This finally feels like close to the bottom for PYPL
I sold TDOC call at open...
I never follow DKNG is it a buy before they get the numbers out ? To lazy to do the research![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)

Can someone poke AMD with a stick
Finally my 6500 LCID shares are paying off 🚀🚀🚀🚀
#TF WHEN DID COFFEE GO FROM $7 TO $10.50???
Nap time
LCID still actually undervalued. The reviews from professionals are clear, best EV tech and best EV package in the industry. In house hardware is way beyond what’s available. 

Rivian at 80b puts LCID in the 40s. With TSLAs recent action I think Rivian will be valued well above 80b. I wouldn’t be surprised to see I’ll LCID fill the gap to 52 and head up from there.

AAPL will most certainly dump after earnings, but what about AMZN?
What profits?
Here comes the LCID bagholders
Somebody’s got to service them
SKLZ making me all kinds of rich
How is lucid almost worth as much as Ford??

Ford already has the electric mustang and soon the electric F150. Also they sell 4.2 million cars a year and have an established manufacturing process around the world. 

Lucid hasn’t even delivered a car yet.
Congrats LCID. Take your gains while you can.  Since I did not make it to the party, looks like I have to buy some PUTs as it will go back down next week.
TQQQ has been my best friend lately
Exactly! It used to be the other way around
Wtf u programming
Im waiting, The earnings will tank it just letting it run as much as it can before i go in
Sold off at 34

That makes sense.  Profit is profit.  I had a call.  Made money, but I should’ve set a trailing stop instead of selling altogether.  At least I made money, that’s all that matters, and at least you were wise enough to take profits.

So glad I bought F at open

VLTA is ripping on other EV pumps. Has a low float. wonder if it can squeeze.

I’ve been holding bags at $28 forever so when it finally broke I sold it assuming it was going right back down. Glad I kept a little but still
Pltr possible gap up?
SHOP till you drop or what’s happening here
At this point, I am pretty sure Cathie Wood has no idea what she is doing. I hope she bought at volume discount... otherwise she is truly one of us.
X gang where yat 🏗
I'd buy some when it cools off. Or if in the future when they deliver and they run into a small recall that drops the price down, I'd buy into it. The vehicles reviews are incredibly positive so far and well priced. The stock has a ton of potential. It was a very risky stock a few months ago, but that's going away with all the positive news about deliveries starting.
Not at all. It's only up from here

Deliveries out soon.
*HaHa! I'm in danger*

LCID
the creampie is inevitable
Really glad I kept quietly accumulating LUCID during the panic sell off the last few months. Averaged down to $22 (after initially buying in at its peak) and this run is feeling GOOD.

This shouldn't surprise anyone

Lcid is the next tesla after all and elon is being a bitch 

Might as well fuck elon and go to a competitor

Broke. You probably have 0 dollars worth of calls at this point.  I am sure you are aware of this.

HOLY FUCKING LCID
What rumor
I just sold some at $15 for profits a few weeks ago. I'm holding until $20 to sell some more and will still hang on to some.
My standards are way too high. Why hasn't SPY reached another ATH in the last 30 minutes?
#EW A POOR!
Too much green today, I am suspicious.
Up +15k on LCID now holy fuck yeah
That’s like 1.3 billion they will have to pay
Decided not to buy LCID 30c at open for .50 now im in the 35c at 1.30 lmao
I threw $300 into LCID calls last night and they're currently worth \*checks notes\* $2,800
I hope not I'm waiting on a pullback to jump into calls for er
amzn making me coom 🥵
Imagine being excited over your own foolishness.

most tech... like msft and goog aren't 75% of the tech sector...
LCID DCA: $17.50. Sold out. Thanks guys. I believe in it too but I'm cool with walking away from the poker table at this point.
Damn it sucks buying puts on days like today.

Alright I cut my losses with SPY, really wish I didn’t miss lucid
Sold my spy calls I bought on end of day dip yesterday. Easy money!
NEVER
Grabbed WISH 5.50 calls .05 looking for a double . It’s holding 20 ma next stop 5.40
Lol I bought at $10 and sold at $90 best move of my life. Can literally thank my future on that move.
come on $TSLA bers just surrender your buttholes already
Typical $WISH holder.
Ownership is petty enough to not let the price fall below $16 for long.

They're spending up to $1billion this year on share buybacks.

It still has random days where it jumps a dollar and I'm kinda banking on that.

If not I'll be a couple thousand dollars closer to being a disgusting 🐀🐀🐀
Damn BB really doing work today

Wtf Visa ! U whore😡

You forgot to mention that you are DEEPLY GREEN and INTELLIGENT
Sweet dreams are made of LCID
Now kiss both you you
Already sold all my morning calls on QQQ/SPY now I have flipped to ATH level puts on QQQ. 

I’m expecting a replay of yesterday’s afternoon dump. 

Not going to miss it today!
I’m thinking 155$ strike fuck it
Can’t wait to buy a Lucid Air with these gains!!!
Arsenal fans are masochistic. They enjoy getting buttfucked
$SNAP steadily climbing, still under my price tho (60)
Up 120% on LCID 38c in 15 mins. Dont miss this one!
Which one you get ?
Do a banbet if you're so sure.  Spoilers, you won't.
return of the zuck
[deleted]
Yeah sometimes simple is best
Mangos drizzles with honey ?
You are making my point.  It's not mentioned there because they know nothing about it because Donnie hasn't pumped it yet.
Up 22% overall on the month, really can't complain about a damn thing.
Anyone looking at LCID today? 70M short interest that hasnt been covered yet. I guess we should go +50 tomorrow or by next week.
Wood doubling down on HOOD is kind of bizarre, their own numbers show that they basically killed their own growth story.

The company shrank over the past 3 months.

Everything they innovated has been copied by others.  

There's just nothing there.
GME or AMC?
That’s it AAPL last run of the morning… 153 in sight!!
VISA seems like a good buy rn
Almost tried to catch this V knife 3 times today.  Glad I didn't
What? How is tech at ATH? Doesn’t the market know that u/ninkorn thinks most tech dumped after earnings!
QQQ ATHs golden bull run confirmed
Can Amzn break 3450?!
successfully fomo'd into lucid cause why not
your first mistake was assuming a bear had functional brain cells
I watched lucid all morning and did nothing. Oh whale
I just bought spy calls...why is it dipping!!!
I relate to that major.  not the specific food choices but the general sentiment.
Only 300% more to go!
Gme nice bar!

Yeah, I stopped playing it. Nothing about it made sense to me

I was torn between 290Ps on Spot and 32c on LCID all expiring tomorrow. Went LCID and prolly made the wrong call.

i still love GME

Amazon and apple, yall take care of my 1dtes please!

Lmao this gay bear is all worked up because I called him retarded for claiming most tech *dropped on earnings* 

Yeah my guy AMD is up 15% in a month but because it dropped 2% from ATH that sure is *sp0okyyyy* omg I can only guess people didn’t like earnings you’re so right u/ninkorn

it's looked like that since the ipo.
Thought the V sell off was over fucking kill me
FOMO’d 400 shares of LCID at 32.33
They drip feed into the elections from each contributor so as to try to disrupt as little as possible, but it’s inevitable. They will have a a time window in which they promise to execute the trade. That is why you see higher volatility in the morning, during power hour, and end of quarters. So you could say there’s a little discretion from managers to steer, but it’s mostly handled by computer algos now.
I see this argument made everywhere and it is wrong.  Head over to partiots . win and tell me how many mentions of DWAC are there.  I'll give you a hint: zero.

When the Trump partnership announcement came last week there was a couple of posts about it, but most of the comments were saying that they weren't going to invest in it because: "the stock market is rigged so what's the point", or some variation on that sentiment.  Will they join [truth.social](https://truth.social) once it is live?  Probably, but I think people are overestimating how many ppl in the MAGA crowd are going to throw money at this.
Just bought more ocugen in anticipation of 11/3

Nah.. not really.

i once asked for t-shirt brand recommendations for the best t-shirts and someone actually recommended this shit called [Grunt Style](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/9c54f11d-9d67-4ebf-af11-31fe892c237b_1.eb56c7626e6c7f030ee928c50c6b1ae0.jpeg?odnHeight=612&amp;odnWidth=612&amp;odnBg=FFFFFF) and i think it's the worst brand i've ever seen
Seems low for a complete scam company
Tempted to take profit off my lcid $27 call but knowing me it’ll probably go to $100 next week if I do
I'm calling my shot. $16 calls on RKT, 11/5.
**Public Service Announcement**

u/nervoustumbleweed wants you to know that you are not a bagholder even if you bought it at the top. 

The trick is - Just don't count the subsequent decline in price. You will always be in GREEN
Listen… I ain’t complaining, but, why we pamping?
Good day to be a beer

Good choice, I prefer retards to hyper senstive children.
Options profit calculator says the 448s are the play if we expect spy to close at 453 today. 500% gain of bought now and closed at end of day if 453 is hit
What's your loss percentage?
Sir jack a lot officially the goat. Through the farm at TDOC yesterday
I’m in new york
Lucid is launching🚀
BUY IT
I think we would get so much more volatility if markets closed from 12-1pm ET. You get two openings and two closing each day
Mangos are best when ripe!
Means 27 percent of the float is sold short. Im not a finacial advisor. Make your own decisions.

Current regrets-
Sold 10 Nov 10 SPY 450c at 1.90 a piece last week, currently ~9.50. 
Sold a few FEB 2022 LCID 30c at 3.00 a piece last week, currently ~7.00. Moral here is have conviction, I thought I could make money faster elsewhere… I did not.
That's what I was thinking. Might take the profit, wait for a small dip to reinvest and then hold for a year

Yeah for today, but you have to think long term ape, TSLA is at 1068, and LCID is wayyyyyy better
Bc what you said made sense. I was going to say something similar, but I was too lazy to type it out then I remembered youre comment. Lmao
FOMO back into LCID.
i sold some FDs gainst earnings IV and thats about it. i'll write calls on actual green days/good pump but for now it might be a bit of dead money until market sentiment shifts on FB
Keep pumping LCID.  Straight into my pee hole
Tesla trading flat is fucking hilarious man. Immediately after I buy a put
u/NervousTumbleweed is NOT A BAGHOLDER

Why? Because even if he bought at the top, subsequent decline in price doesnt count. HES NOT A BAGHOLDER. HE's SO INTELLIGENT

Bro copied my exact post lol. Gtfo using my takes.
$100 - 2% = $98

$100 + 2% = $102… both difference of $2

Did you mean you wish it was the same to get back to $100 from $98?
It's up one penny, calm down lmao
I think imma give up on Amd and take the L
I think all accounting is BS... anything more direct?
I hear producing a fully electric vehicle with a bunch of combustible engine engineers is easy.
Come on plug 🚀🚀
If it’s still substantially higher than it was prior to the run up, no, it didn’t “fall” due to earnings. 

It’s really sad that you can’t understand the logic behind that. It makes you seem incredibly unintelligent.
Just sold my amzn calls buying again b4 close 🚀
LCID TO 60
I'm surprised some grifter hasn't tried to get maga people to open a brokerage account and buy the SPAC. Put out an ad in those magazines they sell at the store check-outs, tell them you'll set everything up for $99.99 and they can buy as many shares as they want.
please leave

Let's go lose my SPY weekly capital on LCID again! Hopping on with a 11/5 $35C. But for real they are in quite an uptrend. Maybe TSLA giving them some shine
Uhm. Yes 120% compared to yesterday. Not compared to open. Also 3k to 500k is 16k% not 166k%.
shit will go back up.  TDOC tech is the future nobody wanna see a real mucka anymore in person

Stop buying cheap shit hoping for a lotto. Get a big, *quality* position and sell at 30-40% profit. 

If you drop 1k into QCOM june 140c right now it’ll print between 15-30%, minimum, guaranteed.

The ignorance of this comment really set me off. So  enjoy the rant. The problem the delusional regards here do not understand is that Qe has diminishing returns on the economy. Youre already seeing that outcome in real time. And to make matters worse any ADDITIONAL QE from this point on is going to have a negative impact on the economy . Inflation will get worse production will decrease, growth will be nonexistant. Were in a fucking trap right now and youre smuggly celebrating your ignorant,truly transitory gains. 

The FED HAS to end QE, it will have to hike interest rates. There is no more printer go BRRR. And if they deviate from the current plan, which is already too little too late, the real economy. Jobs, goods, services, exports will dry up. The world will go into a deep fucking recession if not outright depression.

Doesn't surprise me. Californian ports have had this coming for a while according to people who pay attention to shipping. The pandemic and the increase of buying online during it just finally broke them. I'm going to bet Florida and Texas ports are going to expand since they are the nearest US ports coming out of the Panama canal and they'll see a lot more traffic as importers want to stay away from CA.
by 11/3 I'm saying at least $15 reasoning CDC approval already occurred once FDA/WHO approval (which most likely will take place on 11/3) the stock will BOOM.

I’m much smarter than you. Like, substantially so.
Buy now and the bags will be very clear.
I guess the AH pricing was fake, RAZFF still up 7% right now though so happy with that.  


Razer is a better buy than Corsair imo. They have 25 million debt but almost 600 million cash. More diversified business too. China is a very small portion of their revenue so sky is still the limit.
GM and Ford will be performing better than TSLA over 5 year period
True, I had 152.5c that I sold for a small loss, would’ve been close to up 100% now. A small retard moment

Come on over here son, stop chewing that electrical cord and have a seat on ol' dads lab. Well ya see son bond yields are a good marker for how people are viewing the future of a nation.  It stand to reason that the longer the bond the higher the payout.  IE 30 pays more than a 20, than a 10 and so on.  Now  the bond yield gets inverted when a shorter term bond pays MORE than a longer term one. Now when this happens it is a REALLY strong indicator of an impending recession.  So basically put everything you have into canned food and shot gun shells because ol' J-pow cant control this phenomenon and the bond market has the ability to call bullshit on his whole operation.
Yeah you’re right….not doing research does bite you in the ass

Same. I liked the Bronco when I first saw it, waited to see if other people liked it and sales for it have been good. See a ton on the road. They are doing the right things internally too. Their debt is the only thing that scares me, but I think if they keep it up it'll be less of a worry in 2 - 5 years.

I bought BB back when they first announced their partnership with AWS when the stock was $6. I don’t believe I have made a mistake at all. I did not buy more than I can afford and still have a very diverse portfolio. 

I believe IVY will be huge and BB will have a large stake as ELectric vehicles ramp up sales. BB has also been increasing its partnerships on the security side as well.

A year ago if you told me the price would go above $15 within 2 years I would have thought you were crazy. I was going to sell at $12 and just buy the stock again if it dipped, but held since I saw it soar. The company has financial problems but it's so protected from going bankrupt I'm always happy to buy the stock when it's low.
Tesla sure seems to be building a flying car given how it is soaring.
I have micro balls 😭😭
I’m convinced it is bears who are writing articles

I'd rather not say. That way I'm never wrong and don't have to delete my account.

Sorry, I had calls

Wouldn't be a bad idea. They'll definitely have some big news come out between now and then.

No, it’s not, you inbred dumbass. 

“Dropping after earnings” doesn’t count if the stock ran up 20% prior to dropping 2%. 

Saying AMD “dropped after earnings” or TSLA “dropped after earnings” is fucking moronic, given that they ran up to ATH and held significantly higher levels post earnings than where they were *prior* to the earnings run up.

Do you get why what you said is fucking dumb?

Profits are profits!
There's a lesson here, I think. Lucid is delivering the first round of vehicles to customers on Saturday (10/30). Turns out that successfully designing, manufacturing and ultimately **delivering** a functioning automobile is an important market indicator for an automobile manufacturer.

Happy about my LCID shares, also makes me feel better about my GOEV bags.  I have a high degree of confidence that Canoo is going to deliver vehicles, and probably before their late 2022 timeline if Tony Tequila has anything to do with it.

Yes it will. Buy more if you can

Feeling like some BABA 170 weeklies might be a good move this week. Super close to popping off and tight. Noice
PuTs oN dWaC, oRanGE mAn bAD
I broke it this week I’m now effectively making $800 a day shits amazing and my trades last like 5 minutes max. 

100 contracts on spy sell for 800 done for day.
[deleted]
It’s so annoying. It just can’t break through 40$ permanently. Hopefully our time will come
It should be “takes”
When do we start buying V boys?
What time is ZUCC’s event thing
&gt;chill for a few years

You spelled 'bagholding' wrong.  Nothing wrong with that, we all make mistakes, and you should be in the green on those at some point in the next couple of months since your bags aren't that heavy.  I wouldn't get too greedy if I were you though, I doubt BB will get another meme P&amp;D anytime soon.

I can't help but notice the absence of a banbet though, so I maintain my coward accusation.
$12 11/5?
SPY can I marry you
I just the SPY 462 js the play
my friends selling their 400-600% gains on F calls say otherwise. I bet against the F and got F-ed
PayPal finally bounced
Bro if spy can launch regardless of bs now why did we even have Octobear?
SPY leaps are fucking free money. Never again will I play expensive weekly options.
someone keep my ape mind at ease
For SPY?
Don’t sleep on $SNAP it’s a fuggin rocket fueling up ⬆️
AMD do something already.
SPY not even gone down, even for a moment,  I don’t think. 

someone call the top
I do. 

But the problem is the second I start gambling it dips below 25K again. 

So you see? There really isn’t an escape unless you’re rich rich
Idk
[deleted]
Glad I held LCID, it's ready for another run
Earlier this month sure, but I wouldn’t say this week there’s been a significant dip
Doesn’t really work that well with short expiration and volatility, shit is jumpy af

Edit: sorry you said stop not rolling stop. Nvm
Bears LMFAO!!!
Eventually destroyed by one? 😎
knock yourself out if you want the shares, it is the original intent after all
DWAC is moving again
That's next qtr
Glad I bought SPY calls during the dip yesterday
Lol I'm ded
Now
It’s a metaversal failed casino.
If we hit 463 tomorrow, I’ll cash app you money for a 12 pack 🍻.
Bought ocgn. Immediately collapses. I’m done
Nothing can stop the SPY
I may have fomo’d into some LCID leaps.. hopefully not at the peak but probably

Hopefully earlier this morning
tfw you didn’t buy LCID at $17 early September
Im staying… not because I believe. It’s because Im in too deep on this sinking ship, jumping is impossible.

First reusable test launch I think but not sure
I'm right there. Set a solid $13 gain limit and going to sleep
All-in on LCID easy call

fucking hell why didn't I pull the trigger on those SHOP calls this morning. would have been a 30 bagger :(
When is SPY gonna hit that big juicy $460

When I made my LCID bet of 35, I meant within the next 4 weeks, not the day after. Chill. Or don't.
It will explode
Position improved by like $5 lol.

I don't know what you're crowing about.

It's at 177.83 and my puts are printing as it bleeds

It hasnt hit 200 since September 20th
Yep, and not just Amazon. If you look at port traffic, the percentage going to the west coast ports vs east coast, east coast ports have been gaining share (and fast) since 2013. Even before the panama canal expansion.
Should I jump ship?
CHWY bags from the last earnings disaster are finally a bit lighter today.
SPY calls out here saving my whole portfolio
[deleted]
Where do you see the stock headed? Right now, it feels like the stock has priced in the first set of deliveries, but Lucid has a ton of challenges ahead if it: ramping up production, dealer/showroom staffing, service, etc. It's going to need a ton of cash, time, and strategic planning to be anything other than a bit player in the EV space. And a $169K vehicle basically prices out 98% of EV buyers, even if the range is incredible
Life's gud

There are multiple compagnies interested. July report was about GSK and Astrazeneca, then BMY last week, now GSK, Roche and Otsuka (which owns the international rights of Lupkynis)

If 2 offers have been made already, that means the bidding war started. As an example, IMMU first offer last year was at 55, got sold at 80.
Loaded to the tits on FB 1 DTE calls at varying strikes.

Take me to the multiverse Zuck!
You're nuts to buy $F at even $9 they said. Their corporate bonds are almost junk, their vehicle sales are going to crumble from a chip shortage. Earnings are going to suck. Buy GM instead. Stock went above $17 today suckas!!!
Visa calls looking kinda nice rn
Nah he had orange futures
Early assignment rarely happens. Usually it’s more profitable to just sell the call option. You’ll just get assigned by Monday morning after it expires. So close out for a loss or get assigned. Either way you keep the premium.
❤
I hate this part. When you’re up &amp; having to track the strike constantly to decide when to close

Do happy I've been averaging my V calls the past 20 mins. Keep going up bby.
What is a put?

Something you buy when you’re a 🌈 🐻 that wants to lose money
You got the premium from that CC the minute someone bought it from you
I reckon you can work it out
And this wasn't a dip?
Is DWAC an actual app yet or is it just fictional?
So Amazon and apple running up to earnings for a drop at close. Don’t get cucked.
Which is one of the reasons why it's so appetizing
you got paid the premium when your order filled, you just lose any possible additional upside
Let’s go $LCID we are going to the moon. $TSLA watch out baby. Jk I’m in both so loving the green baby!

I’ve learned my lesson too many times about gambling on SPY when its at ATH and getting burned.. waiting for the next dip for a buy opportunity
TDOC from -10 due to bad earning become +10, LOL. Auntie Cathy should have bought mils of shares
I went to Loopring's GitHub and saw the GameStop bits myself. It's not a rumor that Loopring is doing something for GameStop, and Ryan Cohen in his letter to the board way before he joined it referenced "digital game returns" as something they should be doing. It's speculation, sure, but buy the rumor, sell the news.

So, the rule is simple: 3 day trades in any given week for any account under $25K. That's a SEC regulation that all brokers need to follow.

Why not plan longer term trades till you get to 25K, then daytrade to your hearts content?

I think today is the day to buy some $30p on LCID about a month out.
Honestly if that game store theory about the online marketplace with an ability to sell back digital video games is true, that's stupidly bullish. I wouldn't buy through Steam ever again. I don't believe in the conspiracy theory, but I do think a better alternative to Steam makes them way undervalued if true. I bought a call because why the hell not.
I like you u/ForeskinMilkshake we are on the same page
How is that even possible?  Are you selling naked calls and getting assigned?
Beats me why no one is buying 530C 1/21/2022 at $7 a pop w/ infa package about to come out

Glad I bought more when it dipped after the expiry. Best buy I've done in the last 3 months. Can't wait to visit a show room to see the vehicles up close. Might put a lot more money into the stock regardless of the price to see how deliveries go and if there are any massive recalls. I'm hoping for small recalls so the stock can dip and I can buy more at a discount.

smash estimates that are extreme lowballs. Economy is relative to actuals in prior period or same period prior fiscal year. All an earnings estimate is, is a DCF model made by ER/M&amp;A analysts to further the banks interests. Almost all are within a range of one another because so long as you know where to haircut and what inputs to keep conservative, and you've all been educated/trained in the same circles, it's all the same process at the end of the day. Then you get your try-hard superstar types that try to take more specific approaches but if you're wrong you get humiliated essentially so it pays to stay low and middle ground.

My guess is they are positioning themselves for when interest rates start going back up. Plus, just like Visa and Mastercard, they make a percentage of transaction. So, it's really the vendor paying them to make the sale. Plus, if the consumer defaults on even a single payment, all payments trigger due automatically, and they can send the customer to collections. Not as sleezy as a payday lender or rent to own scam, but can take advantage of it.

There are so many damn bots here. I'll comment something and I get a random comment saying that they also made the same play. When I look into their profile, it was their first comment on WSB and their other comments are from random subs
Still holding…for now. I think it’s still got juice.

I like TWLO as a company but how the fuck are they still losing money when revenues should have exploded in the past 2 years with tech companies experiencing exponential growth
I guess I'm asking more generally - like there's so many managers out there managing billions of contributions each week/every other week - is it really that simple that every friday at 930am they just send it? or is it more structured than that?

Ford has always randomly given me 300-500$ in a couple min. I thank Ford for that. Bought 10 17.50 calls at 9:30, Sold my calls at 17.50 at 9:40. 

Should have gotten some puts right then
When theta has ruined your option positions, the market will let TSLA fly. EOD tomorrow when even a 15% pump won't save your calls.

Good ol GME 🚀🚀🚀
I really want to short TSLA, because it is incredibly overvalued and probably the biggest single bubble in history, but I am scared of that monster stock. It only knows one direction.
was able to get my Nov and Apr calls
Honestly not that bad yet
Yeah Ford cooked the books.
It's the new T
&gt; In the stock market, a short sale is a technique used to profit from an anticipated decline in price. A short seller borrows shares of a company and then sells them on the open market with the hope that they can be replaced at a later date at lower cost – thus making money off of their initial investment.
Between TSLA, LCID and XPEV this week, I’m rolling in it.

Heads up everyone, PLUG, CLNE and FCEL just broke out into very bullish patterns. Rotation into clean energy this fall is coming. PLUG calls are the move

Yeah I'd go shortest time interval possible for a true scalp. However, looking at slightly wider intervals could work for more of a trend play for a daily (but in kang market this would fuck you hard).

SPY is so stupid. Drops at the end of the day for no reason and shoots back up for no reason.
$SNAP or what’s up
would love it. but still wont be enough to safe my October 29th call?

Damn FB really is moving
It’s almost like someone killed him 🤔
When is Vlad going to disable the sell button?

Yeah all travel seems to be in a bear market
Moronic. The dividend is over 2% until $20…you really wanna fight that?
Crazy I havent seen a single DWAC or 🥭 comment yet today
nice flair....jeeezzzz
Just woke up and my mind got real weird. Thought that MW article said: “Biden unveils butthole to the world.”
What's the opposite of beastiality...like let's say a certain mouse has sexually assaulted me.
i am tempted as fuck to take LCID gains 

which means time to sell more covered calls. this time its a bit diff tho...
Pst, noob here. Why should I wait till my calls reach the expire day when they are already ITM?
LC calls  ought at open up 20% ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
&gt; It is a song by the band The 1975.
PTON please resume dying. Thx
**LCID** goin 🚀🚀🚀 all aboard
You actually think they were going to convict themselves?  Naive
Very red very soon
Would have. Distracted with my kid at the orthodontist. Damn it!
Join the line
Hope everyone is jumping into LCID. First customers will be receiving their deliveries this weekend.
I’m selling $105p weeklies. I would love to get assigned. Huge upside potential once the supply chains unfuck themselves

I’m the “10x my last $55” guy from earlier. I spent it on a $TWLO put. Spent it all on a 10/29 $235. Fuck me. Check the options chain for proof. I’m the $.55 idiot
Just revenge traded some more F puts for 17.5 and 17 strike for next week. Fucccccckkkkkk youuuuuuu

I was bullish for apple, but now that it is up 2% before earning.

It means kind of priced in.  Theta gang it is.
This works for stocks not options since you can’t buy options premarket?
I bought calls yesterday during what I though the dip was 😂
you're right, get out by 10. forgot to mention that your interval should be 1 minute and must have 'EXT' enabled to show you afterhours. 5m is too long from what i've observed.
PCG is red. Every time this is in the red the market is usually in the green. Fingers crossed.
It’s ok TSLA, red can’t hurt you
EO charging is your day 🤫
All week open green then get drilled rest of day.  I am sore
Being a 🌈 🐻 for F didn't work.  Should have been a 🌈 🐻 for TSLA.  But not being a 🌈 🐻 for LC makes up for it all.
I’m A bear begging for a crash
Just opened up a position on PRPL, shits oversold af
So, no TSLA pump today?
Where’s your ELON now you fucking bitch?!
The deceleration in real Q3 GDP was led by a slowdown in consumer spending, which dropped to 1.6% from 12.0%
I keep buying the PYPL dip but it keeps dipping. God I suck at this.
FB will rebound tomorrow.. or maybe not 🤡
crazy? ...or totally expected...
CLNE up 7% + volume's increasing + Climate Conference = to the fucking moon
Lol TSLA legit drillen
I meant more so for managed funds. like I pick a target date and fund market cap strategy but have no other control besides that.  


for managed funds- do they just jam everyone's contributions in every friday?
I am 52 years old, and I peaked in 1986.  My life is constantly in a bear market.
Spotify far OTM calls saving my port rn
Unfortunately I thought last week
choo choo LC
those are all variables you can set within a scanner script. Top part specifies what you're searching FOR (price has moved \_\_\_\_% in AH), closing time and opening time are set to be 4PM and 9:30AM, you can figure the rest out.
Told you guys yesterday, $AMD + $NVDA going to have a temporary top.
They will tell you how they handle trades if you look at their documentation or contact them directly. All brokers are different, but generally no: there is no decision making, they won’t wait if the market is going down.
Stop buying puts on TSLA. It tested 1000 and fought back hard, it's slowly been consolidating upward every day since then.
Spy doesn’t like 457
BANBET NOW PUSSY
Kinda of crazy nothing came out of Epstein’s death. Kinda depressing

PTON what is u doin
I’m the “10x my last $55” guy from earlier. I spent it on a $TWLO put. Spent it all on a 10/29 $235. Fuck me. Check the options chain for proof. I’m the $.55 idiot
I need SPY 460 today or I gotta steal the Declaration of Independence.

ATVI no you were doing so well :(
Can tsla just hit 1000 already
a work colleague (boss, lol) has been bragging to me about holding TWLO and EBAY deep ITM calls for like a year now. 

he's going to be pissed, though I haven't checked the damage since premarket

does anyone know how 401k contributions work? is it just every friday or every other friday money pours in? what if there's selling on a friday- do they wait? is it done at open? mid day? throughout the day?
After hours Hertz this afternoon: “Yesterday we intimated we could possibly double out Tesla orders in the future.  You should buy more of our stock!”  (Whisper)”preferably before the taper runs out and interest rates get raised”.
Tesla bb what’s going on
nice lil script, not sure why you got downvoted lmao. As long as you pull out by 10am you're prolly straight.
TSLA no, go opposite direction.
im cash gang after being very bull tsla you fruit loop, i dont give a fuck about the market if im not making money let it all fall for a good re-entry.
Does overstock want more? Dayum

https://myacare.com/uploads/CKEditorImages/f0fda9be40734284914e6bd509c9c4c6.jpg
Damn overstock.
&gt; I would say that they buy in the morning and then hold until friday afternoon. If you are in a 401k, I think it is best to just leave your money there for now because if you try to time the market, chances are good that you will get out at exactly the wrong time
DIE TESLA DIE GO BACK TO BELOW 1000
F the only thing holding my portfolio up
As soon as I see three people blaming hedgies or conspiracies about MM ladder attacks, I know the stock is bagholder anonymous and stay far away.
omfg lcid really gonna break 30
how does that work exactly? Is it every friday at 930 am? what if the market is sliding on a friday? Do 401k managers just buy anyways? do they time it? what're the "rules" there?
My 🌈 🐻 positions need another spy crash
Imagine being in FB. Feelsbadman

Anybody playing GFS today? Shit is a worthless company, there is a reason AMD spun that shit out
Gonna save this, keep it up as long as possible thanks
amd literally robbed me
Up 35% on aapl atm. If it goes to 152.5 before earnings ima dip
closed above prev day. not real down day. Gap up and bleed to above prior close is a theta suck not a selling day. 460 is still on the table but had to slaughter greedy pigs on the long side and sucker greedy pigs on the short side
The only thing that’s been holding it green all week, Tesla
Nice. Except they will probably get even more when THEY sell them.
Hopefully by the 12th so I don’t lose my ass..
It's a scam cult.
SoFi jist need the bank charter and to raise guidance and we'll be set, student loan finance resumes next year also

AAPL out here forging its own path
Lol like 7 years after the last crash?
SPY being up over .6% right now is the most ridiculous thing in the world after that GDP number.
LCID deliveries Saturday
AMD going back to $100 before it goes to $200?
Spotify doing well this month
Even when i dont play it apple makes me lose money
SHOP is about to fly! Get your lottery calls now
AAPL back above 2.5T market cap.
 When do we forgive Zuck?
If covaxin is approved then OCGN stock will rise from 10 to 100$. They have 3 billion vaccines to sell and better efficiency than mrna.

MRNA went from 15$ to 300$ when they only had 50 million vaccines to sell and worse efficiency
I guess PYPL is a dead company.
That was at 1070
Growth decelerated tremendously ... organic revenue deceleration to +38% vs +50% last Q.

When asked on the call mgmt didnt have an answer for the deceleration so its very much in the penalty box.
If you like losing money

What's your position?
Sign me tf up lol
Amd is so close to hitting my ban bet.
LCID poses far to great of a dilution risk above $21 - me an idiot.
I finally got out of my T calls thank fuck
Bruh why does AMD do this ?
1DTE 160 calls are at 14 cents. Some people still out here believin'
From experience, if you have to ask sell em
It literally went down yesterday clown
Bought AMZN calls for earnings. This means they'll definitely dump right? All my earnings play so far was shit
Tim Apple 🍏
BABA about to go vertical, watch.
LCID, nice! been holding since $13 in the very beginning and didn’t sell at $50😅
I am all in on this MO dip.
Probably sometime today unless you want to risk getting theta'd
Took profit on my Tesla calls and my F leap.

What now
BOOM!!!!  Someone bought my 20 35 calls of LC for 8.05!  4 bagger in the books!
You're learning!! Good job
Wtf is holding spy green
Nice green candle on clne this am
I can't confidently speak to numbers as I'm not a medical professional but a layman's guess at &lt;5% would seem fair.
Cmon spy 460c
Is F going to need another F to pay respects, or is this a real run?
It's almost like all of America buys into it every 2 weeks
I'm a dad and yes, highly recommended.
Woosh.  Took those TSLA gains for 7K before the drop.
Classic daily TSLA pump &amp; dump
I don’t really care, but my wife loves them. Dropped several hundred on the camera and pulse-ox and used them religiously. He’s a healthy baby and has had zero problems but I might have married crazy. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Oh, duh! Thanks for the tip!!
RKLB 11/19 calls might be the move. Launch window opens 11/11 and ER is 11/15, might see some significant jumps around then
Yo good luck to future job seekers who are going to have to Interview with an AI analyzing your speech patterns and posture to determine if you’re a spaz before even getting near a set of human eyes. This shit I’m looking at rn at work is dystopian af.

Cathy needs to come to the rescue and buy a fuck ton at a discount. She’s in too deep with TWLO at this point to not scoop up some shares at these prices.
Goddamn the tech bubble is huge, but got to ride it!
Why? Price or didn’t trust a new product?
Same question here
I bought spy calls near open and then panic sold them...FML
Should I sell these $150 Jan AAPL calls today or hold through earnings? They're up 40% now.
Prpl, Two
SPY literally never goes down.
Took a couple week break because I was tired of losing money.  Jumped back in today.  Bought LCID at the top.  Feels good to be home.
So probably what 3% of baby population would be advised by a doctor for use?
Ok nerds when do I sell my F calls
If you hate money and are easily fooled then yes

Waiting for QQQ to hit 100 Day SMA before jumping back in
TWTR being an absolute piece of shit
TWLO beats both earnings &amp; revenue   
But tanked hardly because COO resigned. What a stupid time to announce resignation in earnings date.
But LC has been buying loans for months and earning income on them. Not bashing SOFI, just saying it’s not a fair comparison yet. A couple quarters after bank merger and they will be in a better spot.

Before buying spy calls always have your profit and loss margin man.

If it hits your stop. Cut.

If it hits your profit spot. Cut.

Rinse, repeat.

Now. If you wanna gamble, that's different.

Pump it bois
there must be 9-10 million shares with sell orders at 150 - soon as it hits... has a pullback
Im really hoping for it, but i dont have a good feeling about. Last time there was earnings we had a good few days of gains.
I used to talk mad shit about the ServiceNow CEO for wearing sunglasses when he’s getting interviewed on CNBC. Then I learned he lost an eye. Now I still do. Goofy ass bitch 🤣

&gt; Motley Fool is a very good financial research company. They are not that great at picking stocks, but they have some amazing writers and analysts who do an excellent job of making you think about the market in different ways. I would recommend their website to anyone interested in investing or finance
This part of the day is like Always Sunny before a game of CharDee MacDennis. Good luck everyone.
You must like AOC then
Ok just 1 more minute 10 seconds
She'll do it with other people's money though
SHOP is an e-commerce platform...the fact they made their thesis based on cannabis purchases through their platform while it's still illegal is silly but $100 would've been a great entry. Is Motley Fools any good? I don't pay for any of these research papers/news.
Especially when they have no teeth
AGAIN, the Play today boyz is: ME!  ..ME ME ME\~\~
Even if they become half of what Tesla is we’re still getting rich.

Fuk that stock. It’s worse than a savings account. Sold out and moved to UPST
the idea of a level playing field is a human construction, does not exist anywhere in nature, to my eye, and sounds like a bullshitty excuse for government expansion and appropriation from capital holders, with the implicit reasoning of "but the poors will burn it  down if we dont."

it's 🤡 behavior
i hope today is a bloodbath
Probably run up today, and then either keep running ah or crash
GDP report this morning. 2% GDP growth. 


The American economy expanded an annualized 2% on quarter in Q3 2021, well below market forecasts of 2.7% and slowing sharply from 6.7% in Q2. It is the weakest growth since a record 31.2% contraction in Q2 2020, the advance estimate showed.

probably get a good pop to sell them. Don't be a debby downer. That's how you sell early for a loss and then fomo back in at a higher cost basis and end up with bags. Make a reasonable assessment starting with "how much of this can I afford to lose" and if the answer is all of it then you should hold for a pump - the open looks to be in your favor. if you have spare cash buy a hedge or something.

Guys… you don’t have to cry tears of rage every time DWAC goes up. You know that, right? Trump is gonna be rich no matter what happens to DWAC, it doesn’t matter how much you hate him
That’s the thing- I know there’s a ton of private wealth in the world that can afford AMZN’s price, but for a lot of retail investors(myself) I can’t bring myself to buying one or two shares. If it were below $1500, then I’d be more interested in getting in. Being in Canada- hey money goes up in USD, but I’m also spending in CAD. So it’s not $6,800 for two shares, it’s really $8,300- where I can use that powder to have more shares in something also safe and affordable.
Sure, but if you're under $25k you can only make three day trades in a five day average anyway. And if you have a significant amount of cash already settled in a cash account, you can make multiple trades a day.
Stay nimble guys. Don't get chopped up

I like the perpetual enthusiasm but it hasn't even hit the 459 price target you had at the beginning of this week. SPY is going to do what it's been doing the past few weeks. It'll probably be .3 - .5% up EOD at best. I mean I hope I'm wrong but the volume just isn't there and hasn't been for a while. Maybe look for other plays.

The big difference was that they are tapering.  They been announcing tapering for around 6 months now, but people are still going to act surprised.  There has been bad economic news all this time but the implication was that Fed would print us out of the bad news, so the bad news ends up as good news.  That's coming to an end, and people still don't comprehend it even tho they been fucking saying they will be tapering for 6 months.  I always thought that the fed could avoid most of the bad parts of increasing rates by announcing their intentions a year+ in advance but its clear now that everyone will just ignore it anyway so there's no point.

My companies HQ was built like right before covid and its honestly beautiful lol. It was really upsetting to see quite literally NO ONE in the office when I was there.

Yes, hence my calls are for the EOY and my PUTs expire tomorrow.  Wish they would not have brought back dividends and instead would have bought back stock.

Even if covid ended tomorrow there is no way movie theaters make a strong comeback. With streaming and new movies being released daily in various streaming services the new movie hype is dead. Nobody is flocking to theaters to see anything but maybe a new star wars or avengers/marvel movie. It's a novelty attraction at this point

I like being in the office but I will never be FORCED to go again. I live somewhat close to my new jobs HQ at about 1.5hrs so I plan on going in every once in awhile. If I lived closer I would go in more frequently but if I lived right next door and they forced me to be in the office I would just quit lol. It's why(among many other things) why I quit my last job.

The Bottom Line

WKHS stock is down for sure, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Currently, the stock stands apart due to its low valuation. This window of opportunity might not last for much longer.

Besides, it's nice to see some changes afoot at Workhorse. The company can finally put the pedal to the metal, now that it's stopped looking in the rear-view mirror.

It was the first UPST lmao. Lending club makes unsecured personal loans (like UPST). They have the advantage of a larger customer base and owning a bank charter. So they can actually keep some of the loans on balance sheet for huge margin. UPST has to sell. UPST bulls tout the lending/underwriting AI, but LC’s credit model is very sophisticated. Their loans outperformed all other marketplace lenders during COVID. less loss. Less delinquency.

Can confirm. I have been holding $BABA 215c expiry Jan 2022.

They’re gona use AMZN to fake pump the markets like they did with msft and tsla. Calls are free money
Just tell me what FDs stand for and reddit will do the rest

Can BA please just drop harder, a complete nose dive below like 2 hundred, that's all I ask.
Glad someone understands. It will be interesting to see the flows IF bond yields are allowed to rise. A few months ago I threw around the idea of having 0 interest rates and QE infinity as the Federal government can’t afford high internet rates on debt
LCID finna moon
if there's anything I've learned over the years, it is that you need to form a solid thesis and then you need to fuckin stick to it through thick and thin.  Sell if you need to but hold that shit if you can and if you believe in your initial investment
Ok.  Find your safe space before your head explodes.
When is gdp available
Telling lies?
Lol who is selling Ford. I'm adding ever dip
I was that dude. Finally cut losses after 6 months of sideways

That's mostly for people who charge the car rental to the company so they don't have to make stupid stop on the way to the airport.

Yeah, just sell and don’t look back on twilio. Take eyes on something new and more stable, ie no earnings... At least that’s what I will do.
We can buy fractional shares, but options are impossible.
Can we do brk.b instead?
Green open, but slow fade to red kinda day? Sigh I hope not :(

it is spelled "dooty"
If LCID continues to hold this level until open, I will sell my calls for probably break even and then cry on the toilet for entering such a stupid position to begin with
that piss goes straight to me
Yo hook me up with a permaban. Last time I asked zjz asked why I would you ask for such a thing? JUST DO IT YA CUNTS!

Tapering and interest rate hikes already mostly priced in. Inflation not transitory priced in. Will have a little pullback soon from new ATHs, to slowly grind to newer ATHs shortly thereafter. So far, 75% of S&amp;P earnings have beat consensus and guided higher. There is no catalyst for a crash.

Fuck my heart valves and fuck healthy sleeping habits.
i know i know sell half at 100% but im greedy and wont do it
Not after Biden’s agenda passes
Thanks visual mod. I appreciate the reaffirmation.

My F puts now look like a bad from yesterday. Good thing I got LC 35 calls to make up for them and my TSLA 1200 calls.
Straight up. Maybe both
The Market hates huge spending bills. It will definitely tank the market!
im like pigpen wit my middle finger up
I’d give her a 9.6/10, conservatively.
I’m deep in this mfer. I don’t think 50 is out of the question in the next couple weeks. Killer ER yesterday.
BE the Roaring Kitty you want to see in the world.
&gt; The bill will not pass. It is a wish list of things the Democrats would like to do but can't because they are in the minority and have no power
You're just salty that you have to work on Christmas.
Your girlfriend hot?
I don't trust the media as a whole regardless. But the government is sketchy and this bills looks like it favors them and only them. A $500 bil grant for Government daycare? The fuck?
Margin is like the hot chick you want to fuck with then finds out she loves fucking too. What you did not know is she's a dyke
Well considering it was dumped 10% for no news right before earnings it’s really only up 20%
No different than fucking. Nervous you might blow your load too quick the first time.
Options could pay big homie. I’m expecting 3 new highs from here.
Very nice beat by MRK.  Strong pharma roots coupled with a huge push into the (relatively) unoccupied antiviral space.  Once they get MNPV approval for Emergency Use, they’re headed above their ATH.  

Great stock to own period, but especially a good time to get in right now.
Good day to buy GME
Taper will hurt. Atleast jpow talking will stop the rally for couple of days starting next week. Then we have cpi data, gdp and employment numbers
Guess these SPOT FDs were not a good choice.
Im not a huge fan of the bill, but if it passes itll be a net plus for the market in the very-short-term and since i cant control what laws pass ill at least try to make some money off it
Okay, FB, we're gonna go up like 7% today, okay?
Mechel still undervalued imo
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/talm0** bet **MSFT** goes from **324.77** to **305.0** before **2021-11-11 07:33:23.568215-04:00**
Ford calls bought midday yesterday are looking good….  Hope premarket momentum keeps up.  I need a win.

&gt; Yes, but it's really risky.

Is there anyone with enough balls to short TSLA ever again? Maybe the highest stakes roulette wheel in the entire market.
Im sorry. I hope you got to make many pleasant memories with her.

Obviously you *can* compare them, but the whole point of the idiom is that it's a false analogy. I could compare you to the helpful bots, but that too would be comparing apples-to-oranges.

I'm not a big fan. My mother died on Halloween 11 years ago
No, but I do hate people who like it more than Christmas. Like WTF happened in your childhood?
Tesla is the market apparently
I tuned out when he said bill was 8x the cost of National interstate system.  No shit Sherlock.  That was built in the 1950s under Eisenhower.  That was also a time you could support a family on a single income blue collar job.  Apples to oranges.

Fox News is nothing but fear-mongering.
When will the market realize this rocket plane was a vanity project of daddy Branson and never going to be commercially viable
Just heard a news anchor (fox of course) say she was personally offended they didnt raise defense spending with china and other adversaries rising.

ah, nah dawg. we're not that dumb here.
Price predictions for TSLA today……
You can also lock gains with puts having a delta close to that of your calls if you can't trade spreads.
indeed. I had made bigger bets in a bathroom stall and lost. You can even trust yourself nowadays.
It's a clip of a Fox News segment.
Theyre hoping they can see their dicks one more time before they die

Sleep four hours, chain smoke, drink coffee all day, stare at screens. This is the way!
Did you see what is in the bill? This will crush us.
445p for me cause SPY always dips mid month due to Fed meeting and economic updates on 12th and 14th
Connect
Doesn’t matter dems run house/senate
my first call become consumed by theta decay and stupid spy. I am truly WSB retard.
Never forget the ATF went to people with mental disabilities and went "here's a shotgun, I'll give you a bunch of money if you bring it back with the barrel sawed off" and then went "haha you fuckin retard you're goin to prison"

They even paid some retarded kid to get a tattoo of a squid smoking a joint. That wasn't to entrap him into going to prison, they just felt like it. 

Think I'm joking? Look it up, this is true and it's nothing compared to the peak autism levels of the ATF.
Why not it's only up 35% in pre , What could possibly go wrong
*taps microphone* 

TSLA.
Wait until after AMZN reports - look at the chart after their last earnings report - it was a complete bloodbath on GOOD earnings! If it goes up and you miss it, there’s always a dip but  if it tanks hard like last time you don’t want any part of that!
Lmao. If you guys think this bill is gonna pass, you're out of your mind.

Can we please remove this bitchbet that’s covering a third of my screen? Congrats on being a pussy
Curious why you think that?
Should I yolo into LC?
It's still probably oversold a bit.. I think it bounces back into the 330s relatively quickly.
Nah this guys right, just did some TA on the monthly chart and this things about to pop
My tilt watchlist is growing. Put F on there because i was gonna buy calls at $13 and now its tilted me hugely
Holding, hoping market drags it up

Yep, Sell SPY at open, move to LC Calls and Hood Calls.  Betting on Upstart like movement for LC and that within the next week, RH adds another canine currency to their list.  This would also explain the currency movement as they would need to buy a lot since wallets are not available.
Earnings report was not good enough for the algos.  Maybe it’ll rebound today but seems unlikely.
Too early to have cucked myself in the old thread but I did
I pray.

Don't be a pussy
Do a ban bet
Feel like we gonna see huge jump with earnings
Reading this got me depressed as heck.  Best of luck brothaman

Bears got real fuckin quiet.
Im pretty sure the use aluminum now
So MO beat EPS, raised guidance, and expanded their buyback program.... and its down 1.18% in 15 minute

Fuck me

Edit: nevermind kids dont read articles about earnings while the call is still going 😒
hoodrat market doin hoodrat shit
It wasn't actually the FBI, I was working for the ATF on that gig. No idea why they needed that lady's face nutted, I just did what I was paid to do
🥭 up 10% AH. TA says we going much higher. At least 3 divergent highs from here. 420 by 11/19. So 11/19 $140 calls $3 now $280 by 11/19
Thoughts on Teladoc?
Shits been a wild rollercoaster hopefully it stays up.
Do you not turn calls into spreads to lock in gains and reduce potential loss overnight?
If amazon does bad as well, you can average and cash out before affrm earnings if you play wisely and spread out the calls
LCID is up this morning - having a good week with deliveries starting Saturday
JUST OPEN THE FUKIN CASINO!
I guess that was it for the pullback.
🤔🤔🤔🤔
Thats exactly I felt about upst and missed the train. I guess affirm will do good if Amazon do good. Make sense.
Next time just lie to ur self that u sell those already and next day wake up with real tendies
Looks like my 19 SPY 530C 1/21/2022 will be fucking printing boys late dec
I cant believe how hard its still running, i think its a 2T company but its gonna hit that period of time like apple and amazon when they got so big they went sideways for a year or two
Making bread doesn't have to mean slaving away, but that's exactly what happens with at least one parent if not both. It's possible to find a balance where both parents spend a lot of quality time with each other and their kid(s) without compromising their quality of life. Unfortunately either greed or poverty comes in the way of that oftentimes.
We about to see. I got 3650 calls for amzn 🚀 not too sure about apple tho
I’m too new to do the fancy stuff.  I just buy stock and have to sit on it for 2 days.
Yes morr room but will it move if Amazon moves? No. Is it 20% up already and possible dump? No. So buy calls for two weeks apart easy money
Fuck you Ford you great heap of old fashioned bent tin
currently locked for pattern day trader those tsla calls look so juicy but damn i cannot stand buying and holding those overnight. So good luck those who bought in i think tsla gonna hit 1150 eow
I bought the puts yesterday morning and the news I feel has already happened.  Approval is imminent.
If BUD could hold this price until 9:30 that would be super
You clearly are, ill have you know ive been consistently losing money here all year!
&gt; Yes, I do.
Gimme Inferstracture dollars 💸
they will annouce name chance. do you think it will have effect on stock price?
I rather throw money on LC. Affirm will probably do good too. But LC seems undervalued. More room to grow.

edit: woops nope after hours, yea could be a fine play if you can afford it. I still think a stock split if possible

Lol you really think those aren’t theta traps too. Good luck.
Hey be nice to VisualMod…
I spent a year watching the house this couple lived in once to figure out their morning routine. Every day when the guy left for work his wife would sleep in for another hour or two I noticed. One day I snuck onto the front porch and checked the door and confirmed my suspicion that this guy was leaving the door unlocked. So a few days later when he left for work I walked up, went in their house, quietly searched around until I found the bedroom with his wife sleeping in it, and nutted all over her sleeping face. To this day I still bet she thought "aww that's sweet" on the assumption it was her husband when she woke up
I dun understand how you people buy puts on this stock before close. Its down 8% and has covid vaccine for kids news

Both parents being off for 6 months is unrealistic and is part of what’s wrong with this countries work ethic. It isn’t a male or female thing, but one of them needs to be out there making bread
At this point TSLA calls are literally free money

It just seems to be very volatile. The beginning of Nov should be decisive, regarding the new regulations. I'm bag-holding pretty big on it. I'm try to take advantage of the dips by buying calls and selling em on the upswings
VLTA positive news,calls still criminally cheap - thank me later
Yeah im just tryna sell on an upswing cus i was too broke for near-the-money. Grabbed a strangle with a big window instead and legged put the out yesterday for 20%, now just tryna get even or a little profit on the call then ill roll a debit spread on a dip or something so i can get closer to ITM

Depends. TSLA's options are way too high, so you'd have to get calls very close to atm. Anything else, and theta will burn your money away.

Hey, if you are serious and you just fatfingered a trade, you have up to 30 minutes to call your broker, and they can unwind the trade for you and make it as if it never happened. 

Once the 30 minutes have passed though, then you are stuck with the position.
Yup, my $.01 shopify call for tomorrow is easy as fuck to hold

I've been holding Tesla since $300. Just noticed the institutional ownership is less than 40% now. Am I right to be concerned by that low number, or is it beneficial in this circumstance?
*Joe Lonsdale, a founder of Palantir Technologies Inc. and a prolific venture capitalist, stoked a debate on Twitter about parental leave, saying any prominent man who takes six months off with his newborn is “a loser.”* 

I never took six months off, and I’m lucky enough to work from home and have the chilliest job in the world – can set my own hours, don’t deal with meetings, etc. I’ve talked to many friends and colleagues who have had kids, many who worked long hours to earn more money to afford the bigger house for their family. With their kids older now, pretty much all of them say they wish they spent more time at home and that the money wasn’t worth it in theend. You can’t buy back time with your baby growing up, and those are precious moments. I’ve been so lucky to be the first to see my son crawl and walk because I was at home. And I think my son is already better off because he’s had both of his parents at home way more than either of us did growing up, especially when you factor in the pandemic and the lost time he’s had with his grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, etc. Americans are truly fucked when itcomes to maternal/parental leave (as well as vacation time in general). No wonder people are generally apathetic and dealing with existential angst all the time.

Hello, Moto
What expiration date?
It’s easy to hold options once they are down 80% or so. It’s the 20-50% down range that’s tough.
Why own BB when you can own all of their customers and profit instead? 🤔
Okay lets do the math. Currently apple is 150 dollars which is about 2 trillion dollars in cap lets divide 2 T / 150
It has about 13 B shares

If we multiply by 200 x 13 B we get 3T valuation 

And your logic says multiply by 420 which is about 6 T valuation.

Good luck

Feeling bad today?  I’ll cheer you up!  I’m a noob and I’ve done pretty well so far.  Yesterday, I was flipping between NET and XLNX watching charts, reading the DD.  Got a phone call, left my order screen up thinking it was on XLNX and ordered 30 NET at $182 instead of XLNX.  Took me about 15 seconds to realize what I had done.  So, if anyone needs me, I’ll be changing my bandages on my 30 wounds each and every hour today.

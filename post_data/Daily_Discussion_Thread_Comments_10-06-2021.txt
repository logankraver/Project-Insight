Yea they report earnings before market open.
Ended with my account today at $69694.69, BULLISH!!! üöÄüöÄ
Ever notice how after a few days like this you don't see a lot of analysts listing price projections?  Example...in Yahoo you can scroll down on several stocks and see nothing for October.
UNG $26c 11/5 üí™üí™

Why are üêª so üåà?!?!?
Now that debt ceiling is resolved big money is coming in eod to buy up bargins
Losses don't hurt so bad if you just consider it a 100% loss as soon as you buy and any profit is just a bonus.
Gap will be highly correlated with the Dow Jones / SPY indices, as it is not a tech company. Most price movement will be driven from *other* similar companies, not Gap. That is the first thing to understand about the market.

GME is largely controlled by algorithms for hedge funds. It's not comparable to Gap, which is such a popular ticker that it is less vulnerable to manipulation.
Amc squeeze?
Giga Chad SPY i love you
Well done retard. Can‚Äôt wait to yolo my whole account in ODE calls
Absolutely nothing of significance that the public is allowed to see
SPY really said fuck the bears.
This morning I said that we will close abv 14750, when we were down a percent
AAPL showing it too can be a meme stock this past couple of weeks with all these violent dips and rips.

Lol no one works anymore
Bulls gonna be tight when they realize +0.4% is their only green day rest of the week

My suggestion would be pass a clean a debt ceiling increase with 50 votes because that is what you actually have the votes to do.

You bought them right when the IV blasted the price up. Truly retarded.
Glad I took my stop off my spy calls last minute
Bears thought they had it all this morning
Very often
best game in town
so many traps really i just cant
Something like that. I had 3, sold them at various times
Looks like we're kicking the can down the road. Going to be up and then crash down even harder when the crisis hits.
Buying QQQ stock, tomorrow we are going to have a badass bull run
At what time are the jobs numbers tomorrow?
I bought AMC today also.
Haha think you jinxed us both now lol

The just found out who Kira is
Hut is a mining company that mines and holds a certain digital asset that I‚Äôm not allowed to talk about. The underlying asset is on a huge run up including being up 7% today. The stock price usually outperforms the underlying asset in price appreciation. It is not because options expire next week. I don‚Äôt really care because I hold shares and longer duration calls.

100%.... supply chain fear is a coordinated retail pump
Weed stonks are beat the fuck down. I bought some TLRY shares cause I don‚Äôt see how it could get worse. Those may be famous last words though.
Downvoted for pandering not crash
Sentiment readings don‚Äôt work well anymore because everyone watches the same ones 24/7. Don‚Äôt expect them to get extremely one-sided at least to the euphoric side since people are much more aware of sentiment levels that preceded prior corrections than they used to be.

Back when nobody understood the concept of a bubble and got blindly sucked in, if you were one of a small number of people paying attention you would‚Äôve had a huge advantage but it would‚Äôve been very hard to see it because nobody was talking about it. Now everyone talks about bubbles so it‚Äôs very hard for people to broadly get sucked in without having at least some awareness (even though there are plenty of bubbles going on within the broader market).

TLDR I dunno when the next correction will come or if we are in the early stages of it now but when it happens it will happen with pretty measured sentiment readings
The bears were absolutely vicious this morning in the comment section but where are they now? I've thoroughly enjoyed today's price action :D
I didn't know you can actually buy stock of Seven Eleven (SVNDY)
Don‚Äôt be a bear during power 5 minutes, it‚Äôs hazardous to your health.

Think I‚Äôll wait till open to average the puts down
Today was stop loss hunting galore

I'm new to the market: Yesterday an article came out on yahoo speaking about hedge funds piling into gap and bought it at a high price, does this mean itll get even lower? And is this the same thing that happened with GameStop?
TLRY price hasn‚Äôt moved but my options are up 50% why is that?

Debt ceiling getting raised, no other reason we pumping

Corn is still pretty high in price but the harvest was really good this year and labor shortages are clearing up a little so there is some skimming off the previously overvalued contracts.

True for some tech companies. The smart startups have locked in low interest rates for the next few years and hope to make money by then. Then there are those that don't need leverage because they are swimming in cash, which for some reason also drop when interest rates go up. Which tells me that the market is at least partially acting based on a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Today was just get everyone to sell their spy calls and buy puts tomorrow gonna drop. Maybe $423ish then Friday back to $435.

Well played. 


The drastic quick moves threw me off too much. Was up a lot temporarily. Sold some. Repositioned and then the put never came back. Tried to use call to counter early on but then spy stayed too flat so that decayed as well. Ended -33% roughly on a little over $250k. Big ouch.

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs bullish if it‚Äôs solid, but if it‚Äôs wet, it might as well be mustard gas.
Fr tho, you could literally do that without it being completely retarded as long as you're also holding a bunch of other less OTM calls and the only purpose of the $500 calls is to drain the supply of covered calls and lock up shares by the hundreds to help your other calls profit. You'd have to have a lot of money for it to be worth buying 500 of them for that purpose but you are locking up possibly tens of thousands of shares that way (depends how many of the sellers did covered calls vs naked)

There's a certain correct balance where if you go past the balance then you're helping everyone else at the cost of yourself, but if you stay within the limit then the benefit to the group is worth your portion of benefiting from it

Too many companies rely upon rock bottom interest rates to be as leveraged as they are, and they've got years and years of rapid growth already priced in. If you can't maintain the same leverage due to increased borrowing costs, anticipated growth rate and PE multiple has to come down.  


This is why QQQ is often much more sensitive than SPY to moves in the 10-year yield.  


Ultimately, a tech company can be doing really well and their stock price will still fucking tank if Federal Reserve increases rates even 0.25%
Earnings being priced in

Holy fuck quit passing false info. No the debt limit isnt raised. NO they dont have an extension til Dec as of yet "The Senate is slated to take a procedural vote later today on whether to advance a House-passed bill to suspend the nation's debt limit until December 2022, which Republicans are expected to block."

If you're buying calls, remember, it's always better to buy 10 $5 calls than 1 $50 call.

Every call you buy has the potential to lock up 100 shares until expiration date, so the more actual contracts you get, the more you squeeze the SPY supply and force it to meet your prices.

The thing is that the same was true yesterday, when the market climbed five bucks intraday, and Friday, when it climbed almost ten bucks. Of course in the meantime there have been dips, too. At the end of the day, companies create value no matter what the value of the currency is - might even be good to invest $5 now to make not $10 later but $20, better than holding on to that $5. Expenses will be passed on to the consumer as always, the rest is psychology.
So it can fall hard tomorrow
Hopefully, today kind of reminds me of those days the past few weeks where we'd get a green day, then drop the next day but end slightly green from there, which was followed by a 1% drop the next day then a 2-3% drop the day after.  This pattern has happened twice already, and I'm a bit worried it's going to happen again...
hells yeah!

Damn, well it seems we both might be fucked. I'm just praying to break even, but I'm doubting it now. Whoever got to unload their bags into my port, fuck you and you're welcome

I still think bond yields will continue to rise over time, oil will keep going up, a bunch of important commodities on the supply side of the supply chain are going to get really expensive this month and all winter. It's not merely a matter of readjusting supply chains back to normal in the wake of the pandemic. Something has fundamentally shifted us into an inflationary environment that is building momentum that the Fed won't be able to ignore.

Bring back Craigslist casual encounters
Drill team 6 just got the boots on
SPY is gonna do what it did yesterday and tank down to 432 at close.
Stop the MRNA bleed

Take my energy SPY‚Ä¶let‚Äôs get a 434.50 close ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Like you I guess
‚ÄúWhat a great buying opportunity on roku‚Äù I said to myself as I preceded not to buy any
I bought some puts, tomorrow should be some profit taking.
I just sold  my Marathon stonks to buy more. Im in with 1750  shares now (almost all in).
WISH about to moon into close high of day here
God fucking damn it the other day i was debating between SI and FB calls and I chose FB. I think its oversold like crazy but apparently the market doesnt agree
How much of that is margin?

Another day, another 7% day for SI.  I love free $$$
At least bears put their money where their mouth is ü§ê
A sub-430 close for SPY would be great!

Lost 6 months worth of gains in puts. I'm going to take a break from the market for the rest of October. And in that time just hate myself.
Fck, at the office and have to come up with a plan to make all my money back. Looks like calls on anything this morning would've done the trick.
Not sure what‚Äôs going to happen at close but you‚Äôre lying if you say today wasn‚Äôt fun as hell. I haven‚Äôt gotten shit done all afternoon and won‚Äôt do anything but stare at candles all power hour.
I would let her take me out for a nice seafood dinner and never call me again.
The market isn‚Äôt crashing, and SPY isn‚Äôt plunging to 300.

This dip was a reaction to changing economic conditions and outlook and isn‚Äôt some ‚Äúbubble bursting‚Äù

Don‚Äôt listen to FUD from WSB users who have no clue what they‚Äôre talking about
less thinking more buying
Nah, he‚Äôs going to let the democrats have the vote and one or two will dissent and McConnell will laugh like a drunk toad

Honestly power hour is going to be gay. I just don't know if I'll be the top or the bottom
Seriously hitting our heads on QQQ 359.5 again?  Jesus christ
Yeah gotta look at it that way!
i mean is it really 'what the future value of spy will be' or just trading uppies and downies after hours?

The comment vote counts on this sub are a great indicator of overall sentiment. When bullish comments get downvoted and bearish ones upvoted that means we‚Äôre going up because the majority of you guys won‚Äôt be right. Same is true of the opposite though.

EOD dump has been very obvious lately
Nobody wants to peg you. Stop asking.

Friday you will see TLRY in the daily popular thread. I guarantee it.  Today is the day to buy, come 8:30 am tomorrow it will be too late
Imagine thinking I had any idea what was gonna happen today ü§°
Sour hour incoming.
Where were you when SPY hit ten gorillian dollars next week
Knew it was too good to be true
Lmao yikes. That was a big candle
*KEEP RUNNING SOFI*
I hope you‚Äôre a power bottom if you have SPY calls cause she‚Äôs about to drill
You answered your own question.
Good luck soldier

Just a reminder bears: Don‚Äôt you ever try to fuck with America!
Knowing OCGN news is coming next week, feels like a good time to buy calls
With the current volatility, both calls and outs are printing. You just have to pay close attention

Hopefully it will help hedge these bags I've been holding since 2018
Nope, because I do most of my trading in my Roth IRA, and I won‚Äôt see a penny of that until I‚Äôm old and my dick no longer works. Assuming I make it that long, which I probably won‚Äôt.

So they're going Chinese water torture on us instead of red light-green light. F.

They have a extremely strong position, ready to take over as federal legislation for marijuana is right at the door. After having fallen over 80% its a bargain! BUY TLRY

The last 30 minutes should be interesting. Got OTM Puts :D
Woof - I sold my 430c‚Äôs at 431 and bought puts.  I regret this morning lol
Anyone ever just make a small trade and they make $75 and say, ‚Äúhey, that‚Äôs money for dinner out tonight.‚Äù
* first that is WHO approved.  I got some weird shot for Malaria when I went to Africa a decade ago. Still got Malaria 3 times. 1st time about killed me. Second and third time felt more or less like a mild flu.
Tilray sucks
McConnell desperately trying to save his puts.
someone tell me wtf the numbers between the colons everyone keeps posting mean
I wonder who funds CNN, like legitimately funds them
Silly bulls can‚Äôt even get to 435 I‚Äôm getting puts now

Gourd Gang
Welp E*TRADE just fucked me over
In other words, they already have a reconciliation bill, why should they have to scrap it and rewrite it to add the debt ceiling increase, which should be a routine bipartisan item? Also, this is Congress and they are all politicians, so by definition, everything they do is political. Saying it is politics it a bit redundant on both our parts, no?
Bulls - I wouldn't celebrate just yet. And this is coming from a bull.
lol we ending red

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Nah will hit 450 EOW, not worried
well you kind of flipped it. i said it could go down, but also it might stay the same or maybe even go up

i was pointing out some intrigue in the story and possible reaction in the public psychology rather than offering actual play advice
I think if it breaks 435 we see over 437 today.

Edit: make that almost exactly 437.
&gt;Glad the administration listened and is thinking of opening the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We can't beg U.S. companies to start producing more again. We can show them that prices aren't going up forever if there is no additional demand, and there really isn't

Puts. This was a dead cat bounce. 

The market is fucked in the short-term until McConnell capitulates on the debt ceiling.
need help. always base position off whether i can make rhyme


spy fly

spy die


i can not figure which is correct tho
I can't even tell who's winning anymore. Sometimes SPY is up &amp; sometimes it's down. Go figure.

üåàüêª r still fuk in the end, though. ‚úåÔ∏è
QQQ right up against big resistance I shorted at 359 already up $100
*And dumping has begun...*
Why are you holding puts when RSI is like 30??? The risk-reward ratio for puts aren't worth it.
I wondered where all these gay bear posts are coming from and then I realized it was just you posting every 45 seconds.
McConnell comes out and just says Sike!

Would be par for the course
spy is not going to 420 this month. it's just not going to happen. the floor has been set. 

&amp;#x200B;

time for lift off
Buy puts when it hits 435, then set a mental stop for it breaking 437.

You know, when Russia needs to help bulls, we are in for a long bear market.
lol u gonna crash market saying stuff like this
It‚Äôs inevitable, I‚Äôd even say $436
Puts they say.. they r always wrong
Yeep you are right for sure
Might just stay cash till the 18th and ride the wave up or down from there with everyone else.

Also might yolo into 0dte SPY options come Friday
I sold it when wsb got a hold of it cause every pump on here gets ruined for like a month afterwards
I think that's wise.
no pls
Damn it. I might be fucked then, gonna sell my put. Are you expecting a stable run of spy till December then? I gotta pay my tuition can‚Äôt let theta take it away üòñ‚òπÔ∏è.
434.16 first hurdle for spy. Let‚Äôs see what she does. She rejects, this can can get ugly.
It's funny bcuz üêª is üò≠

You're buying puts? Why?
You hacked it
Actually hold up if Rs go for the filibuster I might take profit and roll out positions.
It could go up, but it could also stay the same or go down. That's what you just said lmao

Now you need to transition to a healthy regular diet so you don‚Äôt crash and then drift back to where you started

Me neither lol
Did you sell them at a strike less than what you paid?
You're doubling down on a losing position. But I guess there's worst ways to lose money. Spy is going to hit 441 very soon but theta is going to murder you're contracts. It's a bad position man
They won't.
High doubt
now there is just 1 hr
Debt ceiling drop these past few days was a scam. Wow who would have thought.
üòÇDidn‚Äôt think so. But 140 seems Ok. Hasn‚Äôt been that low since January 2019!
RIOT closes $29 by friday i‚Äôll get a tattoo

AFRM going up 10000% at this pace
Ye I fucked up. I had a assignment due yesterday and had to work on it till 5am
so apparently AT&amp;T basically created and funds One America News

the obvious play feels like that's bearish, but creepy cult power probably makes this report at least neutral for the stock but honestly it could even be bullish
WTF is up with E*TRADE
**ROOT** GET IN BEFORE WE TAKE OFF
Ain‚Äôt nothin gonna keep this big dog down
And just like that we're in the green and all those spy puts for the week are up in flames. This market is wild so we just gotta trend surf

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I‚Äôm dumb could you explain what you are getting at
september made volatility great again
Stronk resistance at SPY 437.
\[narrator\] Late in the fall, we see a brown bear who did not put on enough weight for the winter hibernation. He lumbers around, confused, likely unable to survive the winter months ahead. Here, however, we see the glorious bull, mounting what appears to be his tenth cow of the day, streaks of white powder clearly visible down both of their nostrils.
imagine trying to make vol plays and being on the wrong side tho.
Waiting for SOFI to explode. Feel like it wants to so bad.
My AFRM covered calls getting slaughtered. Fuk u and your max profit r/thetagang
Leaps!
red candle to end day flat only option
Here's the dirty secret. Even if we shutdown on the 18th, take a look at the 10 days prior and then how SPY reacted during the shutdown in 2018. [If anything, the bottom will be around October 18th.](http://imgur.com/a/CxberQa) We might chop between 430-440 and test 420 once before then. I think even if we get a shutdown we are slapping ATH.
Is that a thing? Not the cumming, butt in the S&amp;P?
‚ÄúBreaking news! SPY rallies all the way up to levels not seen since‚Ä¶‚Äù *checks wrist* ‚Äúyesterday!‚Äù

My broker is this dude named Scott I meet him at the 7-11 and give him cash and write down the positions I want and my limit price and he goes to his office and fills the orders. I even get a piece of paper with my positions written down so I know it‚Äôs legit. I don‚Äôt always get the best fills but it does the trick

Congrats on your losses. They will not turn into real profits because it was a bad entry unfortunately
We both did

You made the claim. So it was baseless. Thanks for your input.

SPY was down -1.5% in the premarket. Think about that for a second.

Woah, are you saying said overlords could keep their employee brainwashed well into the internet age despite his intellect by pitting him against online communities, relying on the reactionary nature of these online communities to create a psychologically inhospitable environment for him very personally, ensuring that he never takes control of his life and overcomes his brainwashing? That's a very good point you've got there. I guess in such a hypothetical scenario, they *would* want to protect their asset, and he would become a huge liability to them if they allowed him to become some free-thinking social media addict. I hadn't even thought about that until you brought it up, thank you.
Dont look at it as -$6500. Look at it as premium plus the run up on the entry to the strike price. You made money.

Short olive garden and see how unlimited the breadsticks really are
Yeah, the thing about the pharma/biotech space in general is stocks can be really unfairly valued for an extended amount of time until something changes the sentiment/narrative. Since 2020, Merck sentiment has been poor because they not only failed to produce a Covid vaccine but also terminated an earlier Covid therapeutic project. There's also been the narrative of their revenue stream being overly dependent on Keytruda which is going to hit a patent cliff in 2028.

But the recent developments (molnupiravir, Acceleron acquisition, looking to deploy cash for additional M&amp;A's) address all of the narratives that were holding the stock back. Like most large-cap pharmas MRK has been a value play but they are getting aggressive and I expect they will start being treated like a growth stock soon. I like them on a 1-year timescale and beyond. So yeah not quite a WSB stock lol, but if you buy shares you'll almost definitely do well, LEAPs might be a good play too.
I'm wet.
Seriously wtf
Overall sentiment is turning more bullish. Not a permabear. Just reading the market.

What if Cramer is actually somehow neither retarded nor a liar?

Like, imagine if he just grew up in a time before the internet and got his education through institutions that brainwashed his generation and then he got a job giving his honest opinions on CNBC because the overlords determined him to be trustworthy with the task of taking the information made available to him through his corporate environment and coming to brainwashed conclusions which he could then sell to the public very effectively and sincerely based on the fact that he himself actually believes what he's saying and has the intelligence to rationalize it, making him a cog in a system of oppression through no fault of his own? Wouldn't that be crazy?
daytrading on etrade rn reminds me of when someone in the house would pick up the landline and fuck your last 30 seconds of 14.4k modem downloads, except there's no "SORRY!" yelled out from the other room. It's 2021, etrade, get your fucking shit together.

&gt;I cannot believe Biden just walked in and threw a little hissy fit and he some how got what he wanted instantly. GOP will work with POTUS if enough money is on the line. 

Well yes, they both serve their corporate interests primarily. They generally prefer that stocks go up.

I don't want to get political (this isn't the place), just explain my take on the situation.

I wouldn't say biden got everything he wanted.  He just got McConnell to agree to a compromise that buys democrats time. 

 It seems like McConnell is still going to force them to use reconciliation to pass a higher debt ceiling, so if the agreed upon ceiling doesn't cover the rest of the year, then biden's 3.5 trillion plan is still tanked, and if progressives hold out, the 1 trillion is tanked too. 

McConnell's move will make dumb centrists believe that McConnell is being reasonable, and all it gives Biden is avoiding the market collapsing under him... at least till the new ceiling is reached.

When do you guys take the loss vs letting it sit in the account? I bought 400 MDLM @ $4 and then watched them be delisted and go bankrupt. Now they are a penny stock sitting in my E-Trade account at $0.051‚Ä¶.  I doubt there is ever going to be a recovery, but it doesn‚Äôt cost anything to just let these crappy shares sit in the account. Wondering when people just cash out and take the loss? All I can think of is tax impacts. Anything else I should consider? Or just leave it sitting in my account, so I can see the big red -99.99% at the top of my account everyday as a reminder of being a retard

Why?
There's far to much theatrics in US politics, politicians do fuck all so they have to make a big show about the ceiling to make it appear like they are doing stuff.

I mean, I'm cool w the result if it means that the debt ceiling is raised
I don't want anything dumping for the simple fact retards think the collapse of the global economy is somehow beneficial only for ApeStop but are fine with the collapse of everything and everyone else

**The power of $SPY options!**

Guilt by association. Nice.

Personally I don‚Äôt care, but a lot of short attacks have a pretty significant rebound. This short seller is quite verbose with the pejoratives, and the list of legal firms lined up are in the dozens already. Clear sign of a shill short attack.

this is some pump here aye boys
Oh man these bulls are comedy right now ü§£üôÑ
I posted at the exact bottom of $BABA that all the newbies were getting in buying puts or shorting it so the bottom was in. Already up 30% on leaps. Now I'm well aware for the past year it has a few days of green and tanks even further to new all-time lows and it's nowhere out of the clear yet.....but I really am calling $138 the year low of $BABA
Lol raising the debt ceiling only allows for more currency debasement. Bulls r still fuk
If you have calls, grab puts right this moment and pray you trade out at -10% while your calls soar

Not gonna lie, bers had us during the first half.
While all of that sounds quite feasible/very well thought of, the only thing I disagree with is decreasing the military budget, but from my own experience with being in I can see the reasoning for why it is so high. Most allied countries directly rely on the US for military protection, defense, and technological innovation, but also a lot of the weapons, trucks, planes, ships, ect, require a lot of maintenance and upkeep which costs a lot because of how highly specific certain parts are and in turn they cost more because of those specifications. Factor in the base military pay, medical facilities for them, base utilities and infrastructure, and a-lot of money is needed to properly run and retain our military as the top tier in the globe. Besides what we often see in the news, the United States has absolutely no competition militarily which includes China and Russia. This is due to our global presence, assistance to allies, and our constant upkeep of our weaponry and machinery that most other countries lack in ability to upkeep as we do. 

If anything however, the programs the DOD decide to actually implement need to be more thorough and well researched before starting multi-billion dollar projects that could possibly turn out to be a waste of money but pushed forward because of good intentions and theories.
watch out for bull trap your all about to get railed

You need to learn more politics bud. Mitch was always gonna cave

You'd think if inflation got high enough it would actually increase the value of stocks since the dollar would be so worthless...Little inflation bad heavy inflation good?
Lets see a solid 434 first
Work for a few hours and I'm suddenly making money? What's up with this?
SPY 445 EOW
Everybody likes memestocks
My biggest mistake today was selling spy calls expiring today and rebuying for Friday.

Today‚Äôs been good.
433 0dte 10x so far
No balls do 450C
anyone know how to short "what an angry dog would do if you poked it in the eye but it happened yesterday" added to "a newer form of barter" for longer than 72 hours.

sold some quick calls from this morning, time to buy puts
Hi bear
You know the drill. Puts.
Dam, the repubs saying they would approve a temporary debt ceiling raise is helping spur it up
If it breaks 435 today, are you gonna hold?
lol you don't have to scrap shit, raising the debt ceiling as a solo vote is not hard. Of course Repubs are playing politics too, but be real Dems can raise it any time they want.
Oh man, is it over for bears?
Spy weekly chart is hilarious
If we break 436‚Ä¶holy shit
So it looks like inflation isn‚Äôt priced in. This was about the debt ceiling. Someone should tell the bulls
lol imagine looking at futes last night and now
Gotta start somewhere
Recession cancelled??
I doubt see anything about the debt ceiling being resolved. Where are people getting this from?
I already lost all my money and have nothing left to lose.

Will start selling dick on weekends
SPY strong like bull.
Bulls slapping bears in the face with a pizzle.
SEC Investigation on Elon Musk?

SPY $435c 10/15
buy ABB, good discount right now
If you're going to make a large cap pharma play, it's $MRK 100%. Overweight on them since June for a lot of reasons. Molnupiravir is a massive revenue opportunity, especially if the clinical efficacy is as good as the early data indicated and if the results for their trial involving using it prophylactically are strong. Aside from having a strong business overall and being undervalued based on that alone, they' just made an $11B acquisition and are on the hunt for additional large M&amp;A's. Bullish AF

don't be suprised if this shit dumps like yesterday
McConnell done hardlining debt ceiling. Russia helping with natty gas shortages. No one cares about Japan. Biden said more or less that tanking the market is a no go. Umm.. Indexes have room to recover a bit, not enough to break the downtrend, but maybe. I don't know bro, it just happened

SPY.. 4 more $$ before 3 baby
For those wondering why bears want a correction:

"Because a market built on nothing which is perpetually inflated eventually pops. Better to take smaller, more normal sized, corrections rather than a big one.

Controlled burns in a forest promote new growth. Raging fires destroy everything."
This.  Keep job hunting while you work for.the gubment and get experience.  Plus once you're in the government, it's easy to switch around between agencies.  I am aware of developers making well into the 6 figures.
bought SPY 10/11 430c's at about 429.5, this is going very well ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)

Bears, lol
I had my mom start out with an $11 Robinhood account to play with just to get used to the app cause since she's old I figured she shouldn't have her first trades be real trades that she can't afford to lose money on because of hitting a wrong button. 

A few days later she's down about 50% overall on options trades, she's given up on buying options for now and diversified into 2 micro caps and a crypto, and she's still diamond handing a SPY 10/13 471c refusing to take the $1 mercy bid algos are offering her for it. 

She is ready.
when Mitch McConnell gets his way.
Lmao
this whole time both sides were planning on raising/ suspending it, they just want to fight for position first.

Thinking about getting a first software job with the government because I can't get anything with my math degree. Starting salary says it's barely over $30k/yr.  This hurts.

I'm not even fucking man shits fucking impressive at this point
Strangles and watch the ones I wanted to buy die, but make a little off the ones that actually pay..
Well I hope you're an exceptional options trader and can consistently get them right for a sustained period, because that's the only way you're seeing returns for the next 10-15 years.
I wish I could say the same thing about my options that expire in 2 weeks
Why should we? Economically, countries with high debt to GDP don't seem to face any meaningful resistance in the market: Japan's debt to GDP is almost double, and yet the yen is still seen as a positive value and safe harbor in the Forex markets. Japan's sovereign debt is still considered investment grade as well.

If the argument is that debt repayment is a priority to the government, then there are a few ways to skin that cat. Enact legislation prohibiting any further tax cuts until the debt has been paid off. Return IRS funding to the levels it had in the 1990s, and give them the tools to go after tax cheats and collect outstanding monies owed to the federal government. End increases to military spending and establish a baseline expenditure level that does not increase apart from inflation costs during peacetime.

End pass through taxation on LLCs over 10 million in annual revenue. End subsidies to fossil fuel industries.

It's not that the debt can't be repaid. It's that the GOP loves to blow holes in the deficit and debt when they are in power, then turn around and act like debt scolds when they aren't.
Mvst at all time low today. Swing trading once it moves up a dollar boyyy
DEBT CEILING TALKS GOING WELL

Initiated a SPY 10/11 432 straddle just now. Can‚Äôt go tits up.
Clov will breakout as we get closer and closer to the next earnings. the shorts will want to start exiting their positions as they know blowout growth is going to take this to a more proper valuation. good chance to get in $7.09 tested 2 or 3 times already.

Who else bases their investment decisions on what names make it the front page the most?
And we all know you‚Äôre just a brown noser.
Account has -$12,000 cash. Get margin call, says I owe $2,000. Sell some shares of only holding in portfolio. Couple day later buy the position back. Couple days later get another margin call.

Is this sustainable?
Lmao, don‚Äôt inverse them
excerpt from patrick bet-davids podcast had me in a wtf is going on mood earlier, really hit my singular wrinkle hard

&amp;#x200B;

" the remarkable failure of our current govt is to pass horrible legislature and use years of horrible legislature to take away what we did... we need to pass it so we know whats in it, so we get an insane 50k page bill written by lobbyists instead of our actual representatives... it's a constant kick the can.  
why are we paying taxes, if all we have to do to fund everything, if it costs everything, why are they taking everyones money? why dont you just print more money? if this is what we're doing now, why are you taking peoples money, spending more than what you have, and then giving them a bill for the future as well. And we just sit here taking it, 'we cant default! how dare we default!' - if these guys cant run the country on $5 trillion how will they run it on $8 trillion? "
Happy about my calls, although I am concerned with a power hour reversal powerbombing my shit chute through my pelvis.

Friday: I buy puts, biggest midday rally reversal of the year rips them to shreds.

Monday: I attempt to buy puts, find out I've been good faith restricted. Watch puts I tried to buy explode 7x in value, which would've netted me 100k+

Wednesday: I buy puts, watch them get obliterated by 1.11% reversal rally.

I love how the conversation is about whether to raise the debt ceiling. Notice how no one wants to talk about cutting spending.

It's the same thing about the complaints about cutting corporate taxes. No one bothers asking why we pay as much as we do.

Market is going up on hopes we can raise our debt ceiling. That‚Äôs like maxing out your credit card and getting excited when they loan you more money.. how is any of this good for our economy? It‚Äôs not. Puts on everything until this bubble pops
just go to 420 for fun bruh
Why does everybody have to conform to the same system? Let the people who want to be remote stay remote and the people who prefer being in the office go to the office.

If Mitch is anyones bitch it is China. Look who he is married to. Probably why they are fighting the debt ceiling increase I mean other than the fact we shouldn‚Äôt be perpetually increasing it and wasting money , us defaulting would take some pressure of the Chinese for the situation they are about to be in.
That's why I waited to see which way it was going.  I was expecting down.

That was really nice of them to allow us to load up on puts again. Wonder why they did that?
I hope tomorrow it falls
While i'm bullish myself (this pre-taper tantrum is getting a bit silly now, given that COVID numbers are going down and employment is up, meaning earnings are going up), this "rally" is still well short of yesterday's top, and in fact even of yesterday's close. So we're talking about relatively small intraday swings.
Not sure if I can really trust this run up without any good news. I don‚Äôt see us getting back to business as usual until debt ceiling bullshit charade is dead and gone
It‚Äôs like the largest etf out there. So a lot of people

My job just sent an email saying we have to go back to office. It‚Äôs been over a year and a half, they are smoking crack
**Reason why $SPY will always go up**

Main requirement to join the S&amp;P 500:

&gt;last reported quarter must be profitable ‚úÖ

&gt;aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ‚úÖ

Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in todays economy.

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 10-20 unprofitable loser companies get delisted from S&amp;P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy constantly and always follows profits.

I haven't run a calculation or anything but it's been my observation that the correlation of miners with SPY seems to be explained purely by the correlation of SPY with üåΩ. Also SPY was pretty flat today and it doesn't explain the lack of a big pump when üåΩ rose as much as it did.

Has anyone noticed certain boomer stock websites just stop reporting accurate options pricing during times with lots of implied volatility?  Like instead of presenting relatively accurate and dynamically updated options pricing it will just convert to presenting a couple snapshots during the week that ALWAYS make it appear as if the sentiment in the options pricing is pretty much the opposite of what it actually is.  They will report dynamically updated every minute or so for 2 months on end, then suddenly they just mysteriously stop at very suspicious times.

I would be cautious going long here. Low volume pump on some good news isn‚Äôt a good sign.
Biden said fuck the bears
this pump is your opportunity
Ah shit, bois.
[deleted]
Why doesn't he just not filibuster a clean bill to raise the debt limit? He could do that today if he was actually concerned about the country.
Why because it‚Äôs like 18 dollars
If u bought 0dte spy calls on that morning, u da man
Bers not fuk, bers licking their chops at another good entry.

I grabbed some calls so pretty happy about this now lol
Paperhands who panic sold calls and switched to puts deserve this lol
Pumppp ittttt Mitch
So basically, if you buy a 0DTE spy option, and it moves 1 percent in the direction you picked, you get a ten bagger?

Yeah I‚Äôm aware, but I don‚Äôt agree with removing the debt ceiling completely so there is no ceiling

Yay, 300% on 0 DTE SPY calls today. I prefer to not look at total though.

Nah all I can see so far is just everyone still talking about how horrible it will be if we default. Lmao, I wish we would quit talking about how bad it would be and just fix the dang issue lmao
obvious leak is obvious 


debt ceiling gonna get fixed some how seems to be the message
This has happened three times so far in the past few weeks - down down down, one green day, the next gap down but ends about where the previous green day ended.  Next day, 1% fall followed by 2-3% fall.  Wonder if we will see the same pattern for the 3rd time with yesterday and today.
If it breaks 435...

Get downvoted, cuck
spy calls were in pain all day but lets LFG
There are several Dems who will not support changing the filibuster rules and they would need every single vote to do it.
Wait til‚Äô it turns out McConnell‚Äôs offer is just just a shitty one that the dems won‚Äôt agree to- this pump will pull a total reversal.
Imagine betting against American
If you were born after about 1975, then what you're watching right now is the boomers stealing your generation's wealth. They'll live high on the hog in retirement while you linger in poverty with flat-zero returns for the next 20 years.

You should not be cheering this on. You absolutely will not still have your call tendies even three months from now, let alone in 10 years.
finally $ROOT is up 7% in a day.
Now I see why we are pumping. McConnell might agree to extend the limit increase until December.

Moooooommmm!!!!! The bears are calling the pump fake and gay!!!!! üò≠
Depends on what you mean by worth it.. I‚Äôve opted for short term CCs to scrape a quick 20 bucks or so here or there.. chump change for sure, but if someone was handing out Andrew Jackson‚Äôs on the sidewalk, I‚Äôm sure you wouldn‚Äôt say no. 

The key was - I picked a strike I‚Äôd be willing to close my position at
Same. Fuck this game. On the bright side I bought puts, so not only did I miss gains, im actively losing money

Holy fuck, thought spy actually moved out of it's range but it's just y'all being fucking retard idiots as usual. Literally nothing has changed. 

Bunch of fucking losers yelling at their monitors. No one gives a fuck about you or what shitty trades you made. I know 99% of y'all already sold your fuckin calls for a loss or IV fucked your asshole. Same with puts. Shut the fuck up.

So many people hate on WISH but consider perhaps they do actually execute in the upcoming earnings. They tighten quality control and offer better products. You‚Äôd miss out on at least a triple bagger. It‚Äôs the third largest e commerce market. They‚Äôre not trying to be Amazon, it‚Äôs a different targeted demographic.

Fake pump, but also that cut off mid question?
ah yes the classic 'goes to do actual work for 10 minutes, everythings going fine but then comes back to see entire account is blown up'  move.
Exactly, that‚Äôs what I said to the other dude. Could be just a shit offer that just gets rejected anyways, so I wouldn‚Äôt be too optimistic yet.
CNBC just said ‚Äúcharging forward until the end of the week,  until then we‚Äôll have to see what the options are.‚Äù

WASHINGTON (Reuters) ‚Äì U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday said there was ‚Äúplenty of time‚Äù to pass a debt limit increase through the budget reconciliation process, as he indicated his party would help facilitate a fast procedure.

‚ÄúOur colleagues have plenty of time to get it done before the earliest projected deadline. There would be the potential for time agreements to wrap it up well before any danger,‚Äù McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor.

God dammit SPY you little skank. Running like 2 minutes after I sell my calls lmao.
# Very Cool Very Legal Pump.
Perfect time for another pump and dump. Probably gonna start seeing "DD" soon.
But the Dems could also just get rid of the filibuster for raising the debt limit.
Have the premiums even been worth it? I sold some CC‚Äôs on part of what I own 100 days out and they are still pretty inexpensive.
It's interesting how much üåΩ stocks are underperforming üåΩ. I am not quite sure why. Normally miners are more sensitive to the üåΩ price.

Depends on what the offer is. I heard McConnell just wants to give them a couple extra weeks so that they can do the long term debt limit through reconciliation, which the Dems don't want to to anyways.

No way. Calls
That fucker needs to be primaried. He's a back stabbing bitch
It is really pointless to have a debt limit when they just raise it when they get close to it anyway. Just a political football that causes unnecessary stress to the economy and American citizens.
Yup. Fuck AARP I guess

What's a short debt limit?
Republicans are going to filibuster the vote, meaning 60 votes would be needed and they won't contribute any votes.
they were warned in 2012 that filibuster will come back to bite them in the ass they didnt listen.
Been so flat but not dropping at all even when spy is down which is great. It‚Äôs just waiting to breakout
No they are fear mongering to have talking points next election
Yeah, I suppose that's all you can do in this shit market.

Right now, I'm holding FB weeklies because I think it's hellaaaa oversold, but I doubt it's going to start moving heavy if the general market is struggling.
because it's not biden doing it.
yeah, republicans want to make it look like this is all the Dem's fault if the economy is bad. Jamie dimon himself says the debt limit shouldn't even exist, yet conservative idiots who would idolize him are against it

It's plain as day what this all is and it's 100% motivated by money and the market. Make the other side look bad by saying what red is doing will crash markets on national TV. Then change the filibuster, raise the debt limit, pass the infrastructure bill, and be the "heros".

Long story short: bers r fuk. buy calls.
yes he will probably offer them better than mcdoubles
Motherfuckers act like they're not going to raise the debt limit. Come on just do it. Everyone knows it will get done.
Can't the republicans filibuster and prevent the democrats from passing it? I think thats the problem

I miss the dab bar in Nashville :( 

want to talk to cute blonde budtender girl named Elizabeth until I‚Äôm too stoned to be sociable again

Edit: for the guy who asked about weed‚Äôs legality in Tennessee:

Weed is illegal there. They exist through loopholes. First off they have delta-8, and it‚Äôs high quality shit that actually gets you stoned. Beyond that though, many extracts, like live resin, are THCA, which is a precursor to delta-9 THC. Like, I pay *extra* to get dabs of this quality in NY. 

THCA is inert until heated. You couldn‚Äôt just eat it and get high. As the farm bill legalizing hemp only regulates that you must have a low delta-9 THC %, THCA is legal. 

Then they have edibles. Again, the law states the product must be under a specific delta-9 THC content % **by weight of product**. So basically they just have *larger* edibles to keep the % of Delta-9 THC by weight below .03%, but the edibles themselves have up to 40mg delta-9 THC in total. 

My friends and I were pretty mindblown when we found the place, and more so when we realized it was legit and they had actual dabs, not just delta-8 and CBD.

Price was great too, a friend and I spent $30 on a beer for each of us + a round of dabs (6-7 hits on low temp, got absolutely smacked)
Talk at 3 then the SPY go weeeeeeeeeeee üìâ
Please sell all of your portfolio

If the underlying stock for an options contract you own liquidates and stops trading in the market, the shares that make up the contract will turn into the cash-per-share amount the company allocates. This means that the contract will be worth 100 times the amount per share the company decides to pay out.

All poor people know that they'll give you like two free overdrafts per year per bank account. The first one you can just demand it, the second one you have to go there in person and beg and promise to be a good boy. Third time they won't reverse it.  


Once I got a letter from a bank that I owed several hundred in an account that I didn't open, because it was charged a $25 "Inactivity Fee" for being dormant for too long, which then started a spiral of compounding overdraft fees. I went to the bank in person to verify and they were like yeah, you owe us a few hundred for this account you never used. And I was like fuck off forever

WISH 5.02 5.50 calls getting play. The $5 calls way to go though
QE directly affects all those factors. QE increases liquidity which pushes down rates, increases positive sentiment and thus encourages the use of leverage through cheaper borrowing.

This is what it says for liquidation and trade halt 

If the underlying stock for an options
contract you own liquidates and stops
trading in the market, the shares that make
up the contract will turn into the cash-per-
share amount the company allocates. This
means that the contract will be worth 100
times the amount per share the company
decides to pay out.

We still have a lot of downside in this market. There will be pumps, but they'll be hard to catch. The drops after them will be easier to time as was yesterday to today. I see the correction continuing until atleast the debt ceiling is raised which it undoubtedly will be. But they can kick the can for awhile and we're not short on FUD right now besides that. And there's no guarantee that'll be the end of it. Short term plays will be 50/50 guesses at best for the foreseeable future. Debt ceiling could eventually be a great pump to catch even if it's short lived, and I see a bigger dump or a long slow one but not sure what to look for to catch it. Sit back and watch for hints. This is not a market to rush into and not making a move every day is better than making the wrong one.

I was looking at fib retracement on the monthly. 435ish is looking like a rough resistance and every leg up fits pretty well, within a few cents. Puts are on the menu until it breaks through that, which doesn't appear to be the case today.

If the guy with the money printer who has been intentionally pumping the price of an asset says he's going to stop pumping the price of that asset, it's not a bad idea to bet that asset is going to go down.

At this point the writing is on the wall that it's headed back to 400 or even 380, and the only thing preventing the natural movement toward that is the fact that there are three expirations per week.

There is no legitimate activity in the world that can account for even a single green tick on SPY. This is pure fraud, and it's going to crash and fucking burn.
Lets hear your reasoning why they'll beat and gap
What‚Äôs the play? Puts?
Yep, bought some $11 calls.
You do that after your puts get assigned and you buy the stock.
Biden can suck my ass
Didn‚Äôt sell pussy
I dropped 5k in Tlry few hours ago
My god VLCN just blowing up
I'm there.  It was a false alarm.  SWAT found no shooter or victims.
If it‚Äôs possible to make a 200% gain on SPY options in less than 24 hours then why the FUCK should I care about any other stock?
Earnings aren't till the 18th
Spy spy he‚Äôs our guy!
I'm just saying, we'll have to see signs of a reversal. I don't think we have multiple green days in a row yet.
Considering how red future looked, this is pretty good.
Well us bulls prefer the other direction. Let‚Äôs see what happens when the debt ceiling passes.
100% possible, Biden will atler rules for debt ceiling and we won‚Äôt go into a financial crisis. I‚Äôll be making $34,000.
Buy puts
Ok stock market is crashing.. pls do the housing market next
He talking about options
Lol nah.
I can feel CLOVmania brewing
With rising gas price, power will be rise in price too which will hurt EVs.
this glorious green candle has less volume than very small A-noose
This senate vote is going to cuck SPY again!
Yes, it's to put them on record to blame them. They are going to filibuster it though so it won't even get a vote.
SWBI calls
Cmon Palanqueer, you can do it
And just like that my 10/8 SPY puts are ruined
Levi dd was dumb they are gonna beat today and gap up
Anybody else gambling on TLRY earnings tomorrow?
True but at least its boring to watch during the entire trading day
Same my dude, despair, hope, despair, hope, rinse and repeat
Coinbase shares is the way in these times
Trading sideways guh
Fomo into upst bro.
HOLY SHIT BOYS CLOV ROUND TWO
üòÇ i knew it lol this shit is a joke
This is so accurate its sad

Retard strength market
Seems like they are primed for a pump on earnings.
Kick myself, when they fell to 200 I was gonna buy leaps. :"(
Yep. Just saying that that's why they keep buying and buying weeklies. Easiest theta gang is to sell calls to those suckers.
TMC 10/8 $3.5p
u/AxemanFromMA only $20 dollars and your OTM SPY calls will be ITM!
Thanks to whoever said sell puts at 10 and buy calls at noon
Whoever's staying likes punishment 

Or has been pretty lucky ü§î
I have to say this atleast once a week. Mrna and upst are the only 2 plays you will ever need. You can resume worrying about that sideways trend spy throws you at lunch.
Take it out of park baka!
There is absolutely nothing suspect about the spy price action rn‚Ä¶

If you‚Äôre long it‚Äôs great, will prolly run to $30s in Nov when they start delivering cars. I‚Äôm short term so I got out of it. If it dips to $22 or $21, I‚Äôll pick up a bunch

Sets a really bad precedence, then in the future, if anyone feels like they have some legislation that they want to pass "because its really important" they can point to this case.

Dems have a mechanism to raise the debt ceiling without any republican help (reconciliation).   I understand they dont want to and it may take more time but that's hardly an excuse to go for the nuclear option when they have a non-nuclear option available.

What happens if Affirm doesn't pay its debts? Can they just mint a coin?
My favorite is when The first 30min has all the big moves that pay big and you miss them all.

Then when you finally start taking trades none of them go and all hit stop loss :(
*then. Now type it again, no copy paste allowed.
I successfully called the morning price action over the last 3 days of SPY trading and didn't trade on any of them. Hands too weak.
I wouldn't touch AAPL until it's in the mid 120s

Gotta break that 435-6 wall first. I don't think we'll see it go back up quite yet. Need some flat days first and I don't think today will be flat. Yesterday looks like a retracement in an overall downtrend.
Yeah bro my calls are bleeding
Why didn't anyone tell me to buy Affirm?
[proof lmao aye up25$](https://imgur.com/a/1JTFNt0)

What crazy shit world would it be if the debt ceiling was passed today
gonna pump to 434 for no particular reason at all
I've bought so many dips I'm out of funds for chips.
Well I enjoyed being green for like 5-10 min earlier.  Back to normal crap.
I can see it dropping more because the same was happening for bbby but hearing from the company itself will just nail it down even more
I would buy AAPL at $137 though. Then just hold and sell CC until it rebounds. If it gets exercised at relative market value, I could just offload them on the open market immediately and repeat the process.

I saw yesterday someone bought $40k in $9 puts on DNA expiring in a few days, spent all night looking at the shitty scorpion capital website, put money in my account to buy more dna puts and then slept in thinking the idiot would release any report he had mid morning, like his other reports.

$40k kind of seems like a bitch sized bet though if you're going to release a report.
This was the most important and accurate news all day

That Facebook thingy will never amount to anything.
Exactly. Poor guidance is expected at this point so I can't see much of a drop-off from here. I think I'm going to sit this one out.
Is it gonna pump back up to 430.50, hit 431. Then bounce around there again?
Are you thinking green or red by EOD? I say we go past 432$ today.
I get it. I'm a palantard.

But this thing just does its own song and dance
AFRM absolutely rippin' holy fuck.
I feel like I'm playing with fire holding SPY and AMC puts
Leaps and shares.  Patience
Weeklies are cheaper, so weeklies. More delta exposure for the same amount of capital.
Literally doubled my portfolio by selling the SPY puts I bought  ten minutes before close yesterday about 30
Minutes after open. Hardest part is to wait til EOD to do it again.
Don't ask me if my portfolio was up 36% today then down 11%

You got a plan on how to make it happen?
There were also many times he plunged the market with random tweets at 3 pm.
Been doing it for 5 weeks straight
Spy should move up and down into the close is my assessment
you know you're down bad when at this point you just want to break even and take a few days break

I don't understand why people still try to trade options on TSLA. That weekly, monthly, 6m, YTD charts are genuinely the flattest charts I have seen for any stock. Yet TSLA 800 spam dominates the weekend thread for months.

It‚Äôs a pretty nasty game of chicken.  If the filibuster gets reformed the current administration has 3.25+ years of essentially unmitigated policy changes.  Why give air to that argument at all? Both sides use the filibuster.  It‚Äôs a double edge sword. 

It really doesn‚Äôt make sense in a risk-reward profile to do what they‚Äôre doing.  They‚Äôre pissing on themselves to make sure the room stinks.  There‚Äôs better hills to die on imo.

Hey, I am looking for some help with a college project. For our marketing department, I had to create a hypothetical company so was the birth of Stonk: "Where your money memes something" a hypothetical purely fictional stock trading platform that is very meme-centric. Now we have to create a marketing plan for our companies. One of the selling points of Stonk was going to be its direct integration with r/wallstreetbets. So I want to include Reddit in the marketing materials (all of which are completely non commercial and purely for use in this university project) do you all have any defining moments of the subreddit that you think could fit the bill? Thanks for any help posting this here because auto-mod continues to think I am promoting an actual company.
Another one of these "murica problems" causing every other stonk market to crash harder than the us stonk market. Sup with that?

Companies like Kelloggs tend to minimize their costfunction C(). If it is less expensive to run the production line with humans instead of the initial investment for the automatization, they are going to run it with humans. If workers demand higher wages this works until the point C(workers)=C(machine) is reached. Get some basic education dog before calling people retards.

On the other hand...with material shortages this might just be a clever way to lay people off while waiting for the supply chain to catch up.  Shutdown the plant for two weeks due to lack of material and the workers get scared away to different jobs.   Shutdown due to a strike and they are all sitting outside yelling at the empty building while you collect your salary from home and bring them back on meager raises you already had in the pipeline

If they‚Äôre that far OTM it‚Äôs probably just a widening of the spread that is making it look like the price is going up. Most brokers display the ‚Äúmid-price‚Äù and when liquidity is super low you‚Äôll have a far spread between bid-ask and the brokerage just displays the mid price even if it‚Äôs not a price you can realistically sell for.
It could be that easy: 

1. Buy SPY calls
2. quit your job
3. watch the Fed pump your calls due to high unemployment numbers

Yes, stimulus checks going right into the market, extra unemployment checks going into the market as well. That‚Äôs all ended and tapering next. Seems so bearish. I want to go heavier into shorts or puts but it‚Äôs so tough when there are huge up days like yesterday.

SPY has tested 430 the last 5 trading days. So either it'll drop hard because technicals somehow matter on an index and its a massive multiday bear flag, or that's the bottom and its going to retrace to its trend over the last year with some massive green days this month. Pick your poison.

Wanted to buy UVXY at 23.50 but missed in the morning. Looks like there would be another chance soon.
"Volatility decay can be defined as the effect that daily rebalanced leveraged ETFs will underperform the underlying during periods of volatility, even if the underlying rises. As a simplified example, if QQQ rises 10%, then falls 10%, and then rises 2%, QQQ would eek out a 1% overall gain. In contrast TQQQ would rise 30%, fall 30%, and then rise 6% for an overall loss of 3.5%. While this example may be exaggerated for simplicity, with smaller effects over a long period of time, this effect can really compound.

This means that investors who bet long term on TQQQ and correctly predict that QQQ will rise may still find themselves underperforming. It is not sufficient to predict an overall rise for QQQ but a non-volatile rise for QQQ."

Yes, there is a strong likelihood they will raise the debt ceiling. That doesn't fix the rest of this shitconomy. Literally the only thing going well is the idiots on WSB who are good at losing money. Even then, that's technically bad lol.

I just don't see why anybody is arguing to defy gravity and everything else going on right now to push markets higher. 
  
Like, take the path of least resistance
SPY and "sustained buying" got in a fight a month ago and haven't spoken to each other since
FB at open was the play
Maybe wait for it to stop dribbling on its shoes.
Small dick club
This is clearly a theta market
Neither, prob gonna stay range bound there for today
Yupp
honestly this waiting for the amd merger, while being down so much on my shares, is making me pretty depressed.
It's an uppercut market kind of day
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Tech has been hit the hardest and is quite literally the future of the entire world. Even if it goes down from here, which it might, you just keep buying the dip. Easy peasy, fuck gay bears.
Burry fell off
futures were at the exact level we are at right now for the entirety of last night
When is it time to pull out of nio
This is a very fun day
Missed my opportunity on FB this morning. Was trading at 336 and I put a limit buy at 335.5, now it has moved away from me because I‚Äôm a pansy.
OH MY GOD.........PDD AND BABA.

Keep buying my puts bears
god they were so fucking annoying this morning too
did the yields dump? tech p√∂mping
Are you still bag holding that shit? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

I smell a major dip after Republicans block the debt ceiling vote again
What a battle today
Nice
BABA GANG EATING
fuck it I'm doubling down on puts. it's the only way i'll win it all back
Let us know when you are selling next time.
Okay resistance at 431 and floor at 427 what‚Äôs gonna break first
Fuck my gay life, ramen tonight courtesy of SPY
$GTE shares on the dip and calls. Brent Crude oil over $80. That sweet sweet black honey.
So if SPY = 427.50, then = go long. Kay.
Of course. It's been hit the hardest and tech is quite literally the future of the entire world. Even if it goes down from here, which it might, you just keep buying the dip.
Still higher OI on calls when you add it up
so it‚Äôs obviously still calls on tech ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Look at BABA! Such a Safe Haven!!!

It's the final few struggles of the bears before going back into hibernation. The market can't keep trying to shake everyone off as they need to start buying since there's no alternative. At this point we're down to hourly battles, been through monthly,  weekly, daily, soon candle for candle and then we're done with this bullshit. What are they gonna do with their clients money,  buy gold ? Please.

*We can see that since October 2019 there has been a strong divergence between the trading behaviour of the retail vs institutional regarding the direction of call option trading activity.

Today feels like the trend beginning to reverse to the upside.  This is financial advice.
Remember on those, they reset daily. So basically they have the equivalent of theta decay. Don't hold them for more than a day or two, tops or you will get fucked.
This is the most elaborate bull trap ever

It's not like you were drowning in pussy either.
It's up almost 4.5%....who's the clown here?
Of course I finally buy puts.  Lost $900 in about two minutes.
All it means is that they won't let you buy and sell the same position in the same trading day. People think it means they are kicked out of the stock market.
Can theta gang seriously fuck off for like 5 minutes so we can pick a direction? Aren't you guys tired of winning??

Interestingly, Direct Retail investors generally buy on market dips and did so again in 1Q20. 13F institutional investors typically sell equities during market selloffs while Direct Retail investors provide liquidity."

Careful out there, folks.
Most worrisome part of this market is that it feels so overdependent on big cap tech.

I'm going to say it again because you don't seem to be getting it

If you don't think they are going to raise the debt ceiling you are literally retarded
People with a shitload of money make dumb choices in the market all the time. You keep talking about these huge orders of calls, it‚Äôs probably from some billionaire just throwing money they won‚Äôt even miss at the market just in case. 

There‚Äôs 220k OI on 450c for 10/15. Okay. But there‚Äôs also -

90k OI on the 10/15 430p
98k OI on the 10/15 425p
106k OI on the 10/15 420p
90k OI on the 10/15 415p
97k OI on the 10/15 410p
87k OI on the 10/15 400p
73k OI on the 10/15 390p

So you think just because there‚Äôs huge volume on the 450c, all that other money has to be wrong? You need to rethink your strategy bro

I don't know how you came to that conclusion but you still sound like you were a little shit when you were a kid, that tends to carry over into adulthood.
Research really doesn‚Äôt matter at this point. Blindfold yourself and pick a position
What the fuck is this price action hahahaha
youre goddamn right i held my QQQ calls through that bear trap

This is all fake.  Right?
now we are pumping again, jesus!

Flat market.
I bought spy 453c for nov 5th on the dip. My thinking is that once the debt ceiling is resolved it‚Äôs going to pop. I‚Äôve got some 300p for nov 5th as a hedge in the off chance that the market crashes. Am I an idiot?
Red day, green day- doesn't matter, it's all fucking sideways in the end.  Might as well be a "flat line".
I don't normally do this but...

**LETS FUCKING GO**

**FUCK THE BEARS**
That‚Äôs actually true.  Take the tard out of Palintard and you get Palin which is still tarded.

At this point we gotta stop and watch spy. It's literally fucking over everyone.  It drops, then pumps ridiculously, then back and forward within a span on 3 minutes
They also don't understand its all part of a Facebook mastermove. Facebook is one of the most popular stocks in Congress. Facebook has also been asking for more regulation. The regulation will just be used to bully competitors out of entering the market. Also, all this shit about the health effects of Facebook is just going to be used to justify giving billions in grants to study it...probably to Facebook itself.
New puts going to be glorious
Wow chadsdaq actually might end green at this rate
How deep?
But anyone who used the internet in the late 90s early 00s hates FB even more than Zucc hates humans

Damn I opened my app this morning to see the same thing, I wonder if they are sending this to everyone?
I think it will head down now.
Damn missed the cuck zuk dip
I got SKLZ calls even though it is a shitty company. Sharp 30% drop within a month should be bought back. At least 5-10% increase then I'm gonna sell again.
No it isn‚Äôt.
SPY to $0
It does 100% no logical person would do that before the debt ceiling deadline with that much money.
One can only hope. We need a solid Crash
Vix big green dildo
This movement is insane
Coincidence? I think not.
Due date is the 18th.... When's the last time you saw the attention whores of a government sign anything this far before the due date. I don't see this back and forth ending until that Monday. Load up on calls next Wednesday and Friday. Until then big swing days with bigger red days
Just wait until they don‚Äôt do shit on Oct 18th.

The Fed: "There are major supply chain issues right now and shortages everywhere, how can we deal with this?"

Also the fed: "Lets blow demand through the roof with 0 interest rates and 120 billion a month QE"

All this shit talking. Why can't we just get along and try to make money together rather than segregate a once great sub

The night is still young, plenty of time for that bear battering ram to break through the $427 gates and pull the market down to the next level of the inferno
Glglgl looking like the right move so far
Buy some lube stocks because you‚Äôre going to need it behind the Wendy‚Äôs dumpster in a few weeks once your account has gone to $0.
I don't even know what to swing trade at this point, too far down to buy puts on the bounce, and not far enough down to justify yoloing into calls. Just blehhhh.
This market is drunk
Thanks for giving tip tho. Next time I‚Äôll listen. Maybe lol

I think the the summer you could have gotten away with it on MU.

The day before earnings saw a nice rise of a couple dollars so calls gained a pretty good percentage. Then the stock tanked the next day, so puts would have printed big time.

Sold my puts early. Damn. Got too excited
That way sir üëâ
How many more days are SPY puts at open going to be the play? It‚Äôs been like a month straight of the exact same action. Wait for the mini pump at open, buy puts when it starts to top out, and then we tumble. Seriously almost every single trading day for a month. Even if you bought puts right at open today they‚Äôre green as long as you held through the pump.

Uggg.  Recession‚Ä¶? Again?
TSLA back to where it was before it did the thing
Just saw spy sucking a cock üåàüêª
I didn‚Äôt sign up for this shyt

Give me back my money
You would need a huge surprise for this to be viable. Odds are you‚Äôll get killed by IV crush
we are pavlovian dogs
One day I'll make money again, but that day does not appear to be anytime soon
Yeah I mean everything's totally 100% fine why would this even happen??????

Lawd have mercy !
Was that a Triple bottom off of 427 for the week.  


One can only hope.  


See y'all at wendys.
Hmm I really want to Yolo into weekly calls once I feel like we've hit the bottom for the day but I can't day trade so I have to be sure it goes up tomorrow.... sigh.

Fuck you guys I am buying more calls
[deleted]
are SPY 420 memes back on the table?
i wish theyd just dump spy to 410 and get it over with. but nah gotta drain premium from retail first
no. bond yields being down is bearish, since it means that bond prices are going up - which makes sense because tapering is on the horizon (given the ADP report).
Its your turn to be the bottom
I literally just proved even in red it can be a fake breakout bull cage wombo combo
Nothing like your stock having good news on a systemic red day so it‚Äôs almost like the good news never happened

Being bull hurts, but being facebull hurts more. Fuck yeahhhh daddy
Why can‚Äôt I stop adding calls rn what‚Äôs wrong with me
Anyone been in the red for so long that green feels uncomfortable lol

September and October gonna be sideways, just wait it out. Buy the dip. (Slowly)
Nancy has $millions in TSLA calls. Is she going to let those take a hit or has she cashed out with some profit on premium. 

I don't believe the greatest trader of all time is going to take an L on TSLA
Last lowest support was around 427.30 I believe
Guys in a market like this i play covered calls, sell your options to someone else and make the premium.

CCXI paying me a ton on covered calls... tmrw FDA makes decision on new drug
Bad week for puts, shittier week for calls tf is this.

If you're still bullish at this exact moment, go cash and thank me when you buy back in at the 200 dma test in a week or two
If Biden, Sinema, and Manchin flip their position on removing the filibuster, then the debt ceiling will be raised and the indices will rocket. Until that happens, we will continue to sink as we head toward default on Oct. 18.

I like the theory that FB planted the whistle blower.

Her suggestions for "fixing" the issue is to make a regulatory board of ex tech employees like her because they are the only ones that can understand the complexity of AI.  

Breaking them up (i.e. separating FB and Instagram would not help at all because then there would just be more algos in the pot).

The whistle blowing is literally just "Facebook likes to make money more than protect dumb dumb kids we should implement a policy that all social media needs to follow and let it be run by Zucks ex employees!"

Zuck has also been asking for clear across the board regulations for years now with no action from Congress.

Hello Mr. Bull, 

Please step right this way. Welcome to your new room. The blades... I mean maids... will be right in to clean you up.. I mean after you.

Please try not to bleed on the carpet.

Have a short day!
As a fellow retard and finance guy, SPY will go 200 MA. All fund are moving microcap and energy rotation. Buy the dip for sure but know you will be holding this one for few months before seeing green.

It's a 3x leveraged ETF of the Nasdaq, and the Nasdaq is typically a high beta bucket of stocks compared to the overall market... so you have leverage on leverage. If the market goes up you will outperform by a large amount, but if it goes down you will underperform by a large amount. If you're going to buy TQQQ do it only with money you can loose, i.e. don't buy it on margin.

Rotation from shares (fake internet money) to fake internet money has been happening all month.  Boomers can't even afford to ignore it anymore when it crushes their average index returns on the yearly.
Ahh thanks for the tip, that's definitely a great way to tell how dry it really is. This stem is nowhere near ready to snap. That makes me realize it must just *look* ready to smoke because the outside of the nugget is getting there but not the inner nugget. 

It's also a very small nugget though, I picked it to try first cause I figured it would be the driest based on how small it is. I'm gonna smoke it anyway, the way it feels breaking it up is like there won't be any problem with it being premature as long as I don't stuff the bowl to the clogging point

The ADP report could boost the market a bit. Since the tapering timeline is now established, positive job growth is no longer a bad omen of hawkish Fed policy.

People are fuckin‚Äô weird, man. They‚Äôll follow religions, join cults, spend money on psychics and charlatans promising the truth, anything to try and find some secret meaning to life that makes them feel whole. Meanwhile, there are other people saying (for free), ‚Äònone of this matters, just live your best life while you‚Äôre here,‚Äô and the first group is just like ‚Äònahh fuck that‚Äô
You would need 10x that amount to have a chance of reaching your goal, even then your timeline is so short that you will be taking on a considerable amount of risk.  Would not recommend.

I guess I'm about to smoke my first ever bowl pack of weed I grew myself, mark it down on your calendars lads

428 open would be incredible. Would buy as many 10/15 450c as I could
Let me check my crystal ball
Something is telling me to hold on to my 428 spy puts till at least 12 and another thought is telling me to sell at open because spy is going tits up ..... arrrrgh I don't know and I only have 20min to figure It out lmaoooo
its under $5 its a penny stock lol
I don‚Äôt think you know what that means
Calls based on this price action. Everything has been higher lowers on the trend‚Ä¶we go up at open (I think but I‚Äôm biased)

I‚Äôd like to make a case for a pre-earning TLRY move to the upside. The stock has been beat to shit for months, but has finally found support at the $10.75-$10.90 level. Earnings are tomorrow and because they moved the date up, I am thinking there is some really good news. I think we‚Äôre going to continue to see the positive impact of the Aphria merger on the bottom line. I believe all of the bad news of the past has been completely over done and the shorts have bled this stock for several months. I‚Äôve been discouraged but I feel like we have this moment before earning to really turn things around and make the shorts cover. This could really be an explosive move to the upside if we all jump in now. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm going to get shit for this post because TLRY has disappointed for months. But every dog has its day. I think the time is now and this is the best place to put your money today. This is a short term play on earnings. I don‚Äôt think we go to the moon, but we can take it to the space station üõ∞
If we can break out over $13 (50 SMA) we will fly through to $17.50, around the 200 SMA.
Never inverse smart money, learned the hard way before when I noticed 20,000 contracts of spy $420 puts on Aug 12th
Maybe just buy.... puts?
Inflation happened because of the shortages, this has been going since March 2020

Hello retard
Facts, being ONLY a bull or bear is just stupid. It‚Äôs the quickest way to continuously breakeven or blowup your account.
Low VIX spike suggests the market rebounds quickly
I‚Äôm in the same boat. I‚Äôm patiently waiting and preparing for the return of the Green. See you in 5-10 years.
I am in no way a fan of FB, but the I watched the entire whistle blower session yesterday and it was just cringe. "Omg, think of the children" is the weakest possible way to "prove" Facebook is fukt.

  


(do children even use Facebook nowadays?)
It is looking bad but I wouldn‚Äôt say that the bears won. 

At least not yet.
People listen to Cramer?
Just dump their bags in you again
The relationship is dynamic, if futures are red and yield goes down ie more demand for bonds it is worse for the market because the capital isnt in securities....  When bond rates go up because of interest rate hikes its bad for shitty companies that dont make money because the cost to fund them increases.....  You have to dig a bit deeper then just the correlation between yields and securities....   Maybe Im just wrong to but since Im making money I think I will keep playing it the way I am.
SPY Puts and VXX calls I bought yesterday looking great. Feel even better about them seeing how bullish everyone is in here even with a -1% premarket
RIOT turned around on Monday and is moving higher. It will triple from these prices by November.  Good news regarding production.

It‚Äôll probably rally after open, I can‚Äôt see it tanking. Maybe a slight dip, then rally.

As long as it gets to $5000 by 1/2023 lmao
Like we needed more inflation...
Cramer says it‚Äôs not inflation. It‚Äôs shortages. We are fucked
Transition from boring to sad now 24 minutes away.

the 1 week chart for spy looks awful
Bulls are the kinda people to see SPY up 0.8% from its morning low and celebrate, but not acknowledge it's still down 1% lol I can't tell if it's cope, or lack of brain cells...
No call is safe
Calm down man
Everyone thinks the world is ending &amp; fed buys the fuck out of todays dip is my bet before debt ceiling rises
Well, at least I'm not holding open calls for today's bloodbath.
We‚Äôre free falling. Bulls really think we‚Äôre gonna go up like 2% in one day when we‚Äôre already down 1%?
Your problem is that you cannot accenting any criticism towards to a system, which is fragile and not perfect. The environment will fuck capitalism soon or later.

My mom cutting me off after today so hopefully I don‚Äôt lose everything again today.
Bull traps are green. SPY is red as sin right now.
Learn to play both sides. It‚Äôs as easy as buying options right before close based on whether it‚Äôs up or down. If you by puts. If down buy calls. At least a week out. ITM or ATM. Even if it goes tits up at first you almost always have a chance to get out at break even or minimal loss at some point

No because it just tracks stocks.  Of the value of the companies go up then the stock will also.  But what you are saying is why you should only stay in leveraged ETFs for a short term.
Ok fine I‚Äôll buy some puts.

At this point taper or not the market will crash.  Either the taper will do it or inflation and supply chain problems will.

I think what the other guy who commented is true. All gamblers what I‚Äôm trying to really say is that some make plays where the odds are not worth it.
The 10 year is dropping again, I dont think tech is going to get wiped out today....  I was thinking that this could turn into a real sell off but I think we continue to bounce around the same numbers we have been for the last week.    Oh well get some work done I guess...

If you change definitions, then everything is possible.
Not entirely sure if this means anything, because we all know PM is fake and gey, but MVST already has 50k volume this morning and that is unusual....I watch this stock closely and 50k pm is like double the normal volume.   Looking back at the charts, the last time it had 50k pm was on the second-to-last runup.
Calm down, your calls will still be -90% either way

so much for legal tender. now anything can be used as money
Politicians playing hot potato with our financial future. Fuck those old pricks.
Employment numbers mean no stagflation. Economy will power through transient supply issues. BTFD.
Indeed calls at open is the move
It‚Äôs too easy. I bought spy puts at 2pm yesterday. If it looks like it‚Äôs turning up like it did two days ago I will sell and buy calls at end of day today. If not I hold and wait for the 200 day SMA bottom it‚Äôs a true correction and at this point with it‚Äôs consistency if you are losing money you deserve to lose money. Because I‚Äôm retarded and this shit is easy to read. Not one day trade used and profiting every single day.

I'm looking at my puts this morning the way gollum looks at the ring
Today it‚Äôll end at 429 or 426 trapping the bulls hard. Tomorrow we dip to 420 maybe a bit lower.

Yeah, somebody needs to get out of their bubble and travel around the country
Commie scum
Days like today have me thinking about the time I shat my pants at Pizza Hut and my friend made me sit on a pizza box on the car ride home.
It's kind of scary how people can't identity trends here
should I still buy puts at open? Will it sink to 420 today?
!RemindMe in 7 Days
Bro it‚Äôs getting sad now. There‚Äôs no shame in living to fight another day. 450s will expire worthless

Nah you just talked to people that also watch the news, which is designed to make you anxious. I stopped bothering with anything but the most local news and my mental health has been way better. It‚Äôs only bad if you‚Äôre staring at the worst of it all the time.
Today's too easy. I feel like ppl who go bearish at open today will get burned

#Make vaccines and blood donations mandatory to help more humans. Get it done.

Oh ya baby.  We are gonna pump at open.
Yes and it's pornographic
You live at home with your parents and consider throwing 1k at SPY a yolo. Ain't no lambos in your future lmao
It's driving the bond selloff. A narrative doesn't have to be accurate to influence the market.

Is this really the super power team of American businessmen? The same JP Morgan CEO that literally wanted to cut Americans off, and who is literally probably one of the biggest pieces of shit on the planet
Loaded up on a ton of APPL and spy puts yesterday. I hate poots but yesterday was very obvious once it started going sideways today would go red. Now I‚Äôm not sure if I just sell at open like I originally was planning or hold for some bigger profit. 

Is the debt ceiling vote really that important?
A full clip right?

Nope, I thought about this long and hard and talked to a bunch of people. This isn‚Äôt fixing itself overnight
why does futures look like a bull trap
Welp, looks like we had way too much fun yesterday
Double stack here, jokes on you
I would like to change the game difficulty please
Forward looking markets arent seeing any significant boosts to qe or interest rate cuts. Apparently those are the only things that make this market get high anymore. 

Looks like the markets in withdrawal from its dependence on all that fed stimulus.
Better get there before everybody else
Turn off Fox News and stop drinking the kool aid bro shits fine
This is why you can't buy any calls and hold overnight until bulls reclaim a couple supports
You mean SPY isn‚Äôt going to test 100 today?

Go for it. We seem to bounce up regularly, so a short term swing play is viable. Nobody knows where this bottom is, so be prepared for the possibility of holding the bags for awhile.

Dear¬†Mr. Market,

You don't know who I am but I know who you are and I know what you done. You had¬†sex with my mother and then you stole my dad's¬†money¬†all away. All I know is your name. But one of these days I'm going to find you and I'm going to give you this letter so you'll remember what you done to me.
Because as someone rightly put it, it‚Äôs a kangaroo market

You're developing good habits and risk management. YOLOing every trade has diminishing returns.
Which companies produce stone whes and flint axes?
so what if they raise debt ceiling lol, at this point, yields are going up, tapering is ending, whats there to be excited about?
if the money printer malfunctions due to unforeseen error, is our economy fucked? could a well placed EMP destroy our world economy?
What time is the vote anyway?
Why is Corsair going the wrong way in premarket
We are slowly sinking to the 200dma on SPY. I think each rally is just an opportunity for big money to unload at a higher price. The only way this isnt true is if we stay over the 100dma for more than a day. Otherwise we would bottom around 413.

I think theres still just too much uncertainty with inflation, debt ceiling and global supply chains for serious upward moves right now.
Why do people say 'welp'? You're not in a comic.
You have in n out in canada?
CAD? Bro that‚Äôs peasant shit
I think so, bond yields rising as a result of moving closer to the Cutoff date. Plus Berz sense overall weakness in the market so they pounce

Market is manipulated. Calls are the move today after the initial washout at open
I think we opened -2% or close to it at some point in September last year. This is marginally better than that.
Sounds like a cool lucid dream, try flying to the moon next time

I keep having this recurring dream, about once or twice a week or so. I‚Äôm laying on the ground with my arm covering my eyes. Someone walks up and asks ‚Äúare you asleep‚Äù. I say ‚Äúno, not unless this is a nightmare‚Äù. I uncover my eyes and I‚Äôm floating a few inches below my ceiling, then I suddenly wake up, almost feeling like I was dropped onto my bed. This has convinced me I have somehow found a way to levitate. I‚Äôm going to start practicing it during the day.
maybe.  gold prices are weird.  if you think the markets are going down it's easier and simpler to short or use inverse ETFs
It's called puts

Honestly, I live for the volatility.
A few points:

1. They don't teach technical analysis in kindergarten. 
2. The percentage is close to 99.99%.
3. TA is worthless in 2021.

So im gonna buy spy puts and just hold through the one green day it will have when all the bulls say ‚Äúbers are fucked fuck your puts‚Äù and then the next day when it‚Äôs drilling into earths core I profit. Sounds like a plan
i bought 2 regular ones and squished them together
The world economy is collapsing!
Maybe doubling down on CHPT yesterday was not the best move
Gold diggin whores
So what do u do when it‚Äôs red twice or green twice
I‚Äôm six figures deep in margin and i didn‚Äôt want to add to it üòÇ
Ha. It‚Äôs more than WSB. Have you forgotten what Trump did with that little Trade deal? Our infrastructure discussion is to go completely self sustaining from the resource to the end product. It‚Äôs to do precisely what I said. Haven‚Äôt you been paying attention. Have you actually looked at the Build Back Better plan or do you just go online shilling Commie drivel
They have LARGE McMuffins where you at?
LOL.

If we default and undergo a complete market collapse, I expect political instability that leads to parts of the USA Balkanizing. Radical left enclaves on the coasts, Christian conservative fiefdoms along the south while the federal core consolidates in the East.
Thanks Simpu!

Is it too early to start day drinking yet? Does it automatically make you an alcoholic if you drink this early?
That‚Äôs because they aren‚Äôt allowed to romp like a normal blokes.

by a moist pussy i presume ?
Too üåà in here.  I'm uncomfortable.
Is that your boyfriend?
be careful. someone posted earlier that they did this and got yellow jackets. I tried it and got covered in flies.
hey what's up its your boy simpu üêí

today's key levels to watch out for are 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, and 440 so basically all of them

also i bought a large mcmuffin this morning and it cost $4.41 so look out for 441 as well

follow me for some more random numbers I pull out of my ass
It always be like that
Now imagine if we‚Äôre this down already and DXY/10yr breaks out
Bears gonna get fucked today
Tlry puts. Weed stocks on chopping block
I literally laughed out loud when I saw that headline. I wonder how many people bought into tech because of it
Yeah. If you‚Äôre a fund manager it‚Äôd be pretty irresponsible not to.
SPY clearly just likes 420.69 someone needs to tell the CEO of SPY about the magic of 800.82, problem solved.
lmao read the room
Fuuuck sold my 432 puts yesterday at market close. A day early.
Bull flag just formed on the 5 min chart!
Please lord let me exit these calls or my balls will be nailed to the wall
Yeah you're probably right... we're probably not getting good news on the 13th
I already have the farmland and guns

Shitposting and puts is all that I lack
Bulls being super confident calling this another bear trap like we're not increasing the distance to ATH every week
Buy until it delist or goes into Chinese Govt state own enterprise 

Hell yeah

Why need JPOW money printer, when you have SPY puts money printer at home?
Such as? By overnight you mean AH so 4-8pm?
Let's be real they won't default.

But I guess market has to price in that risk somehow.
Does zuckerberg know he looks like the biggest freak weirdo to walk the face of the earth?
And he kept buying more too, his average is prolly around 180 now. It was cheap at 226, it‚Äôs unreal at 140 but I just keep buying every leg down. Steve Weiss keeps digging that grave, shorts are going to have a fucking hell of a time trying to cover since smart money tucked them in their coffin buying the dips. There‚Äôs no float for them to get out safe now

Yea, not priced in

I got real brave yesterday at close and bought 1 call on UVXY. Looks like I‚Äôm rich boys.
Look dad....another bear trap.

SPY over the last year does kinda look like it's bear flagging...
I only put in like 3% of my account on this, I'm also not retarded enough to flip a coin on my entire account.

I just like to gamble with small size during market pullbacks since I'm all cash otherwise. Gives me somethin to do.
If you are perma anything in a fluctuating market, you're a tard. And I agree, I'm currently bearish, but had calls yesterday for about 4 hours. It was nice
Thanks a lot bud!!! :)

Yup fuck this shit. Just sell the fucking lot off and let‚Äôs get on with it.

Well good luck with those herpes
I feel like after SPY absorbed TSLA it was infected with those 420.69 vibes.
whenever i feel down

i just remember that charlie munger bought BABA at 226
Puts on RIOT and MARA. I have a feeling that internet money is falling off a cliff today
Honestly I like baba going down as much as I like it going up, as someone who legit knows what this will be worth in just a few years I‚Äôm down to keep buying more and more cheaper and cheaper
O wow opened up my brokerage up. My SPY puts gonna brrrr bigly at open

Don't buy this dip. Go cash or inverse.

Usually we have to wait two whole day for SPX to dump to 4200s and pump to 4400s. Futures already set up the dump for us last night so we may see two days of action today. PROGRESS!
My name is nasty Nancy and I like to shake it

What overnight gains lol this went straight down after rejecting from 435.5
SPY said GUH as it leaped below 430
Real question is do we let these tesla puts ride or nah
I have a chance to make 30k I'm fuxming sweating right now
More like 940% to 980%.  That last drop really was a 10 bag for most of us

In march this subreddit was bear city for a good two weeks during the circuit breakers and Trump press briefings. So it's about a two week lag time I'd say. Bottom will be 10/20.

Idk I just woke up to take a piss and saw this but it's not about them forgetting to find oil, it's about the US oil oligarchy not wanting to tell the public about their plans for the great reset ahead of time because if you warned voters that you're going to stop subsidizing the increasing difficulty of oil production then they'd, y'know, vote different.

this is a reply to a comment. okay lets say you are right. nobody knows about any of the things going on right now on the planet and people are staying ignorant. or more and more people are learning that their is a large chance that we default at a later date other then the 18th. china is going to want money pretty soon because from the looks of it they are tanking hard and they are about to explode. do you think your positivity is ignorance with a splash of stupidity or do you think that there is a massive chance were going to see a oil crisis because they forgot to find more oil for years because oil prices tanked. hmm i wonder if stagflation is effecting the world economy right now. i wonder if theirs a crap ton of tesla cars without chips sitting around because they were told to keep making cars to fudge numbers. huh i wonder if you should be doing dd right now so you dont lose all your money

Planning to take profit on my puts from yesterday on 4210 SPX.  Expect to see a bounce up to around the same price we made a high yesterday. Perhaps a little more. A few theta days and shit starts to get real into the next week. Plan to be heavily short SPX around 4370 by approx Tuesday next week, if all goes to plan.
What do you think their goal are over there, Contrarian? Seems to me like their trying to provoke something with their fly overs. The Aus submarines got them mad. Art of War says they should attack now at a moment where the US seems weak and would not defend.

edit: I'm not buying though because it still feels fake and gay

One day I‚Äôd like to just wake up and be winning. Instead of constantly fighting for my life.
So I‚Äôm an idiot, but I think this makes sense.

Bear market is happening because no matter the outcome of debt ceiling talks, it‚Äôs a negative outcome.

Unlikely scenario where it isn‚Äôt raised: US defaults. Very bad. Stocks go down. 

Raised with dems making spending concessions: less stimmy into economy, worse growth outlook. Still rates hiked later 2022. 

Raised with no concessions. Printer is back on, inflation is too obvious to ignore and rates hiked sooner than expected.

Must suck leaving money on the table. I'll spend it in your honor.
Sir, this is a bear market. Act accordingly.
Good. Buy my CC's.
$400 is profit.
It was up 1.25 after being down 2.5 and now it's down 1.5. Yea no any lower and it's going to open at this week's low.
He‚Äôs a sensitive little mofo
MAPS is the only good weed stock but I wouldn't buy any of them until things shake out a bit more
Really should have sold, damn it lol
Looks like bears have summoned El Matador.

Anyone think weedstocks are gonna pump again? They‚Äôve taken a beating

QE is probably halted due to ceiling drama. They may even be selling assets.

But what about my SKLZ calls and the big squeeze?
The market will find a way.
Is this where the bears come to circle jerk before everything bounces back to +10% Friday? Or has stocks only go up finally ended.

Did Jpow say he shut off the printer?
Paper handed puts for a $400 gain 10 minutes or so before close that would have me up $60K+ if we maintain this dump. Did the same thing two weeks ago that would have been $100K gain. This is fine.
There are two ‚Äúr‚Äùs in Turmeric‚Ä¶also in Retard.
I finally made a proper trade. My puts are printing daddy
Green by open, if not buying more calls before dems pass debt ceiling

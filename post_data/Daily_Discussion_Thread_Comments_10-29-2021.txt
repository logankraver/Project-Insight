Sounds great, but have they actually "demonstrated" it?

That could go anywhere from "we ran a few lines of code" or a simplified version of the algorithm to one that truly scales and is actually solving the problem.

We know QC works, but can it truly scale without error?

Sweet thank you, I appreciate an actual response. I may not be able to watch live because of my work but certainly will help watching things
Learn about price action. You can learn everything on YouTube. Al Brooks is a great place to start. You can watch traders trade live and watch archives to see how they do it. I recommend TraderTV Live's channel.

There is still time. FB, Apple and AMZN have been the show this week. It‚Äôll be SQ next week.
Not sure face book would agree.
I opened a Visa 210 9/16/22 call yesterday and closed flat on it today, will close it at 220 probably
Good call, probably best to see what price action is like on Monday. May your trade forever be in your favor my wsbrother

I've had a couple of hard lessons not to hold options to close - roll them if you can, or take the profit yourself... the brokers will fuck you.
Tell 'em, King.
We gonna eat good next week. I got 60k in the 1200c. Cheers
IV is just getting fucky, will affect all options

I ended up waiting on it. Maybe grab Monday. Probably get it a couple weeks out only. But it seems massively overvalued

What trades did everyone lock in for over the weekend? Accidentally put in the wrong employee ID for clocking out so I dealt with that bullshit instead of watching market close
That‚Äôs what I bought and sold them today for a 100% profit. Wasn‚Äôt exactly the gains I wanted, I only bought ten of them because it felt risky. Bought puts right at close. Looking for a gap down Monday I can hopefully profit off of.
Fuck yes dude. I‚Äôm up 16k this week alone on my measly 7k account. I‚Äôm loving it.

OK math head.

I just buy calls and make money. You're busy timing shit and almost having a heart attack while at it. 

Goodluck
Ok, so this last 5 minute to close Pump for QQQ and SPY are directly 1:1 with Tesla. (Look at the chart movements, exactly the same)

So that means nothing else is holding the two etfs up.

That's not a good sign for Monday.
I didn't even have a sell order in

This is the first time I‚Äôve ever bought puts at noon, had the stock climb another 2% in like 30 minutes in a parabolic move, and had the puts climb in value.  Tesla is weird man

Let them buy overvalued Tesla ü•¥
[deleted]
So what I learned this week was .. bad data = good.

That still doesnt explain the AMZN + APPL sell off though.
Jesus tesla!!!
this pump seems suspicious but oh well, straight up we go
&gt; I'm not a big fan of the spy calls. I think that they're overvalued and will likely go down in value as more people buy them.
speculators must be stupid
I made money on Bakkt this morning but after seeing this crazy run, I feel defeated because I sold too early
No, it‚Äôs not. You‚Äôre just spouting bullshit jargon nonsense.
Lol JFC tsla
Complete this sentence once the weekend thread goes live.
Bers r _____
I wish I had money to buy TSLA call a week out . I can only afford weeklys
You didn‚Äôt use a limit?
Tesla got me over here blushing
should I buy spy calls before close? no brakes on this bitch
Im grateful for all the cheap puts I just scooped up. Practically free money

Been holding tsla since 109 (split adjusted) and I'm getting 917 flashbacks. Did not expect a +3% day when Amzn and Aapl are both red. I guess it's true what they say that TSLA can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent
You guys see that movie..Get out?
Tesla split its stock at $1374 last time.

Only $262 left to go for another stock split.

Oh yeah Microsoft right there keep going
Meli falling more than Amzn because of Amzn earnings makes sense
TSLA calls during the last 10 minutes of trading on Friday is literal free money
My house would look like a glue factory
TSLA GOING STRAIGHT TO 1200 next week

Anyone loading lcid puts for next week
Ok I turned my back to cook and WOW SPY!

I saw someone post here less than an hour ago "R.i.p SPY ATH close" 

NEVER DOUBT CRAZY
Spy 420 next week prolly
[deleted]
Puts print all the time. You just have to be quick with them. I bought 1dte‚Äôs yesterday at close, 455p‚Äôs and 456p‚Äôs,  and sold today at market open for a 90% gain on one batch and 70% gain on the other.

Why would you trade options and only ever bet on things going in one direction? Why not make money going up and down?
Fuck you SPY, you cross 459 when I've already sold my calls.
lmao look at AMZN and TSLA go. If my stupid 0DTEs go ITM, I can't cover these 2 stocks wtf lol

Yep totally.

Tesla stock split please
Fucked up another perfectly laid back Friday by gambling in the a stock market.
Sure everyone was waiting around until eod Friday last trading day of the month to buy the fuck out of MSFT at ATH. Totally makes sense.

Damn, you‚Äôre gonna regret closing those long positions and your puts are fuk

TSLA 1200c for next week? Only 1k and huge upside IF it does go up... right?
Holy green fucking dildos
Is there a safe space for üåàüêª somewhere on Reddit? I mean, the WSB kind? I just want some fellow bears to pump me up... That came out wrong... You know what I mean.

Every time I go looking, I just end up wasting tissues...
Bought the baba dip for next week calls, sold for 30% already. No need to hold makes for a great weekend
People are upvoting comments like fundamentals don‚Äôt exist and still arguing that we arnt in a bubble lmao
Holy shit I‚Äôm glad I bitched out and closed my call credit spread on TSLA yesterday
More buyers than sellers

Haha I‚Äôm in cortexyme and I sold 17.5/15 put spreads when it was at 60 thinking it was free money as there‚Äôs no way it could go that low even if the drug doesn‚Äôt work out‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs now at 13
I would genuinely never understand the rationale for buying puts.
#wtf are you trying to prove?
Okay Tesla, we get it. I shouldn‚Äôt have sold my calls, chill
Calls eod? Some whale seems to think we should be going upsies
$12k calls on HOOD.  Am I fucked?

Lmao. 500 big corporations and the average of their stock prices is up a few cents on the day. Nah, nobody is sitting at their desks controlling that. Totally normal.
I just added to some more monday puts, today is too weird.
Think its pricing in jpow passing the buck on tapering next week
OCGN please I have a family
I don't think I can get any harder.
GME has literally just settled into a steady boring 180-ish stock. IV isn't even high anymore. Only a matter of time before they announce like a 3% dividend and just become a boomer stock.
I swear to god, if spy doesn‚Äôt drop to 455 next Monday. I‚Äôm DoNe $rope
So you‚Äôre saying my $940 tsla put today is no good?

From SPY 228 to 458. Goddamn it's been a pleasure gentlemen

Dropping $10k on SPY weeklies
I saying this in all seriousness but nobody is actually retarded to go deep in china stocks after the price fucking they experienced all year? Cause BABA took a big shit today.
The 30% earnings drop wasn‚Äôt enough. He wanted even more.
Tell me spy isn‚Äôt going to do this here at the end. I wondered why my 161c sold for .01 instead of expiring.
I yelled at my laptop a few times a day especially this morning when it popped up to 1105

Deep breathing meditations, wishing good things on other people, forgiveness work.  Have to place self value on things that are not external.  Just guessing though, and what‚Äôs helped me
u/sleazyasshole its gonna be close, any last words just in case?
Because it was cheap lol. I've placed larger bets on blackjack while holding 17.
Spy tanking soon lol
QUIT YELLING AT ME....I ALREADY DID
So wtf will TSLA do next week is what I wanna know. 2 trillion cap doesn‚Äôt sound so crazy watching this stock climb again and again
VisualMod always brings the receipts, gat damn
SPY = retard strength holy shit. Where do these reserves come from lol
Yup, might start with some puts next week. Don‚Äôt see it running much more than this
Any publicity is good publicity

What would AAPL be at if it actually beat earnings?
This is an interesting one to me. I thought they‚Äôd get more of a run up pre-earnings. Find it hard to believe they won‚Äôt beat.
Epic TSLA battle happening right now
I'll be back when GME hits $1k. Been on this sub since inception!!
i usually regret holding shit over weekends but every friday i end up holding shit over the weekend

Betting cash
LOOK AT THAT LCID PUSH, LOOK AT IT
Can't fault him for being a smooth brain

That‚Äôs the spy I know and love
FUCKING SHUT UP AND BUY MORE $TSLA
The Fed won‚Äôt be able to get out of this. It‚Äôll be interesting to watch the documentary exactly one year from now.
What are you thinking?
RKT riding the wave up till earnings or rather getting back to IPO price lol
Is CRSR even real
TSLAs morning volatility was just so thetagang could trap everyone in their 1080 puts and 1120 calls.

It‚Äôs not mod abuse if they begged for it, amirite?
buying tesla calls at close tonight is literally the equivalent of signing up for Squid Game. It's a bag of cash or a body bag.

Oh my god please fuck off with this dumb shit lmao. We just got rid of most of the GME idiots whining about the shorts and fud, we don‚Äôt need a new pack of morons here screeching about that shit
u/cjbrigol had said GME would hit $1,000 by close today [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qhjkuz/daily_discussion_thread_for_october_28_2021/hiexpyd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) or he would take a ban

I‚Äôm thinking over $40 Monday. The first owners are getting theirs cars tomorrow. That should create some publicity.

Such a sad story.

Fairly accurate. 60B market cap for 520 cars lol. They have negative earnings and call is next week, or week after.

You probably have depression. I‚Äôm the same way except not eating. Best first step is acknowledging the problem. Take the smallest step you can. Go to the gym and do one set. Do 10 pushups.

Fucking PLTR. Elevator up, Escalator down. The only time this is not going to be a meme stock is if the ownership isn't dominated by apes. Otherwise there's only going to be swing trade.
My new favorite investing strategy is $SPY calls and watch the line that normally goes down go all the way up.

Blah, FD's all the way. I was down 32% on monday.
You can‚Äôt change the past bro just focus on what you can do going forward

There are people that have been holding BABA for 4 years that haven't made profit.

I think there's a massive amount of put and call volume today and it's driving up the price of both
Yeah, I bought a couple puts for next week when we tapped 459 because I think we‚Äôll get a little bit of a freak out dip Monday/Tuesday, but my guess is we rip up from there.

Edit: freak out dip because of fed meeting.
I bet it moons to 1120
Net legit don‚Äôt give a fuck

SoftBank gonna come in at the last minute and send it above 1100 just to fuck with everyone
Someone asked me in the comments of one of my "market is fuk" posts if i was still short even in the face of the printer.  Here's my answer:

*Yes. Real economy crashed in September. Market is in the process of catching up. Right now my expiries are Jan 21/2022.*  
  
*China is entering a worse than great depression event as all of their real estate and banking companies go tits up in a cascading failure of bad debt, and their citizenries combined life savings get wiped out as the ghost city investment vehicles lose all value.*  
  
*NBER released a peer reviewed paper saying the economy was in the early days of a recession. Atlanta Fed's realtime GDP now puts Q3 at 0.1% growth. That's well into recession territory, and on the border of depression. I am more confident in my position than ever.*

You guys do you, but shit is falling down right now.
So, bad days for SPY are really -0.09% now. All that noise from vix and earnings just to barely move down.

SQ earnings. What‚Äôs the consensus?
Lol
They mentioned "electric" with their vehicle, so naturally they'll rocket 400%
Volume has been huge for RKT today.
I don't anymore after I've had some of my own experience with bad decisions taking advice on here and just being a noob. Was just wondering if that's like a thing where November 1st is a bad day but apparently last year on November 1st the market popped up. So hopefully that happens again on Monday.
Felt cute. SPY 456p exp. Monday. Might delete ^(gains) later.

Is PDT a poverty thing? :)
Since today is opex and all those options will be exercised over the weekend then sold, monday should be pretty red right?
If I think the csp that I sold will not be challenged at all due to the recent run up, should I roll up the csp to try to gain a bit more gain at expiration?
I'm tempted too but 180p at this premium would mean it needs to drop to like 175 to break even...
Napkin basically.
So... did ya do it? üëÄ
What‚Äôs the play for Monday

BofA always overly bearish as fuck. Don‚Äôt know why anyone listens to them.
Busy with work today, but I managed to enter some zero risk spreads between meetings on SPY and RKT. Spreads suck for capping profits, but if I can leg into the next strike for more than I paid then there's no risk and you just ride it to expiry.

You dont trade out of a bank account and youre the one that said you just need some winning trades, so youre the one that defined it in those terms. I mentioned nothing about the amount in my account, im literally saying its much easier to trade without PDT.

For about 3 months last year. They sent us to work from home. I wanted to get fired and collect that sweet unemployment, but they just never fired me. I would play video games for days on end, and not even touch my work laptop. I'd check my emails about once a week, see that I had a bunch stacked up but none that told me I'm fired, and just went back to videogames. Skipped every single meeting.

After 3 months, I got bored and logged back in and started working again. No one ever said anything to me. All the work I was blowing off simply got shuffled to other people.

That's weird. I'm also under $25k but fidelity doesn't count cash trades towards PDT status, only trades made with margin.
Itll dump for a bit after next week cus the usual economic FUD is coming, but we'll still have at least one more bull run in mid-late november-early december before tapering and shit really sets in early next year

Unless some terrible news comes out in the meantime, i think TSLA will follow the pattern along with the rest of big tech/growth

Yeah, this is REALLY strange. I bet money managers will hold the market pretty steady during the announcement and then for a couple more days. After that, who knows. WAY to obvious to just short the day before. Literally all big money would do that if it was that easy.

SPY 475c
thanks for the intervention VisualMod
It starts with a B has two of the same middle initial and ends in a T
Shouldn‚Äôt you be kangaroo  gang?

Any day trades ideas? I got $500 sitting around and am bored.
Sir i'm a gambling addict.

How am i suppose to know that?
It feels like its either a hard finish or a limp finish the past few days, no chub finish
Msft putting my portfolio on its back rn
I do both. Most my money is shares actually but I play options and then throw the earnings back into shares.
Puts printing.

Indexes opening red on Friday, then pumping, is the most obvious put entry of all time. Assholes tryna get an exit before the weekend.
shit. shouldn‚Äôt have sold those 0dte spy calls too early. always happens to my paper handed ass

Lol who you trynna convince. I don‚Äôt make the rules bro

Jump off that cliff spy, the longer you wait the worse it will be
Last dip before Tesla end of day rally
there are dumber moves tbh. Masayoshi will buy it from you lmao.
buy puts on spy see how that goes
&gt; When I saw this question, I thought you were talking about the Robinhood app. It is a stock trading platform that lets people buy stocks with no fees. The company has been accused of market manipulation because it does not have to pay for brokerage services like other companies do and can use its own money to manipulate prices in order to make more profit on trades.
You bought MVIS didn‚Äôt you
My portfolio smells like dead üê≠ right now. DIS plz fly again.

Nope sorry, today was the top for a while
wallstreetBETS... we gamblin
So we bearish on spy going into next week? I call cap. We hit 460 Monday before the sell off or we just keep fucking going.
That just made my day !

Y'all really think Steve Jobs is just going to roll over in his grave and let some bitch named Bill take over as #1? AAPL will singlehandedly keep SPY drilling up to ATH next week. AAPL to 200.

-.10% this is your red day bears take advantage. Next week green
I think the market favors the Kong tbh. not letting Penn rise because it is pretty far behind on the digital betting landscape.
More autist if you did it all on margin
You could say I wasn‚Äôt very lucid when I bought $2k in LCID weeklies this morning.
Somehow QQQ is still green even though tech is shitting the bed as we speak.

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/PMChristianurschlong (0/1) made a bet that FB would go to 330.0 when it was 318.24 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
So I gather that most people here play calls/puts. Just out of intereset, do you actually own stock‚Ä¶ or are you just gambling in the casino?
üòò
I'm buying puts on everything you guys pump. That's it. I'm done.
What date and price?

SPY with the limp dick  finish
I return to you now in your darkest moments: I am Gandalf the Bear
somebody put a ban bet on it earlier, it's looking okay. I like the profile of the company, but haven't checked financials. 

they're probably a local pump and dump to be honest, for the time being. IDK!!!
Why is pltr like this
*There has to be*

There won't be.
The mango stock sub is probably having an orgy right now
x2
GREE, why didn‚Äôt shorts cover at $20?
Always a good plan to just buy up stocks when the market is making upward momentum towards the ATH where it has bounced twice already in direct opposition of all indicators the Friday before the Fed gives us more information on rate hikes.  Always a good plan.
SPY puts on deck!
FB dump EOD. Look at the weekly, it's been dumped every single time it jumps up. It's also been dumped twice this week at 12:30pm.
George Washington didn't even know what nuclear was smh
LCID, fucking go up more
We are at all time highs. üòÜ
It'll probably pop after hours and be 1200 on Monday. I'd be fine with that though
What‚Äôs gonna keep the spy going up next week? 
Apple? Microsoft?  There has to be a pull back at least next week or the week after? 455p 11/5
These fukin 0dte SPX 4600/4610 call spreads I sold better end up worthless. 
1.5hrs to not have another idiotic rally. Possible? Probably not. üçª
Yup
BARK has been gearing up for a major leg upwards the past few days

EOD today MSFT Put with one week expiry
‚ÄúSell off the market to keep TSLA under $1100, it‚Äôs our only hope.‚Äù
i literally already sold all my puts for 100% by waiting for SPY to hit 459 and buying  a lot of 0dte ATM puts 


actual autist play would not reccommend
God dammit. Another recession?
I know I‚Äôm not supposed to say in here but Mononoke Inu is legit the next 50 bagger. Check it out fellow degenerates

If TSLA closes above $1100 we gonna keep mooning hard next week.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
can't let it get that close, or someone will buy 5 shares in aftermarket for 1300/per and make this shit rain

(joke, but only half kidding, we know the Friday AH wars)
Fuck you man I‚Äôve bought the rumor so many god damn times on this ticker

The following statement sounds incredibly stupid.

"Quit playing options and just buy TSLA shares and forget about it"

And yet, it's been the best advice you could have received, pretty much for the last 10 years and is probably still true for the next 10.
FA and CNBC give shitty advice so ppl in the know can profit off the masses.

Anyone know what happened to DVA? Was looking to get in on it and it's down 10% on great earnings.

Come on SPY. You're better than this. We know you're tired. But keep going...up!
im not sure its going to tank enough to offset your premium to be worth it unless you go ATM...looks like its just getting bled out so the calls arent ITM for today, no telling how it shapes up next week
I think we see spy 500 before it's starts crumbling down maybe

This right here. Market already priced in fed tapering last October. Everyone knows it‚Äôs coming and dgaf.

What the fuck are you going to put money in? RE at ATH and illiquid. Gold sucks. So it‚Äôs literally stocks or crypto.
I should have sold at close yesterday and just gotten the pattern day trader thing. Fuck I‚Äôm stupid.
All the new TSLA shorts at 1100 are just delaying and going to be adding fuel to the rocket
I like the price but something smells fishy
same. It's incredibly dangerous tbh. Everyone's addicted to easy fiscal policies and meme gains like Tesla. People know these are good companies. But the growth  compared to historic trends is mind blowing. The feds created a monster
The same people buying spy

Yeah I hear you. My stake as a percentage is still too high of how I would like to allocate out funds over a basket of stocks. I feel a lot better after today's deal though and even got some more yesterday to average down a bit further. We will get there.
IO looking to break.
Read an article on SA about some dude who sold a the top for LCID and said he thinks its overpriced, entire comment section was people calling him an idiot. Usually its a swath of circle jerking around DD. So this was a refreshing read.

Hey the dog is a pet, not a customer
IV may be too high.
R u in the wrong sub?
&gt; The call options were probably purchased at a high premium. The 1000 strike is in the money, and it is very likely that they will be exercised if the stock closes above 1000 on expiration day.
tfw you didn‚Äôt buy QS $27c @ 0.28 and an hour later they‚Äôre at 2.20 ü§°

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Despite lots of 1000 calls expiring, it can close slightly above 1000 with no fear if exercising. Right? Since most of those calls were probably purchased at a high premium, the breakeven is quite a bit above 1100
am i retarded for buying SNAP leaps?

It‚Äôs true
Literally just buy calls ATM ON Monday for Friday and make money every week. It's that easy, stonks only go up.
Remember last week when TSLA went 10% in last 15 minutes after all the brokers closed out the calls for the poors. That again please.
I'm in deep and stuck in $PINS stock.
Legit though- any sort of investment advice you get online is a load of deuce. MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, MCD fuck- any sort of blue chip stock with a track record. Fuck the noise. Buy the blue chip dips.
If PINS reports earnings very good, imma go big in calls. This bitch is down 50% from ATHs
Brain damage

very interested to see what gives first
spy, you lazy c\*nt
With all the open interest on TSLA 10/29s sitting at 1000,1050, and 1100, why would anyone be buying TSLA shares right around 1100?
All of my yesterday‚Äôs HYZN gains are gone.
I‚Äôm sure if I buy them TSLA will go up to 1500 or something but I wouldn‚Äôt be mad lol
Why should I not buy lcid puts? Can‚Äôt believe it ran that much off that news lol
I am kicking myself - bought and sold TSLA like 5 times for tiny gains.... Sigh
Fuck I am up more money than I have ever made in a single day in my life feeling overwhelmed with excitement but I know that shit can be gone in a second
They do not actually. Girls on there will just advertise their OnlyFans
SPY really wants to break out over the 460 level......
SPY has gotta take a breath. I'm not even saying it's gotta be red for the next month (although, that would probably be appropriate). But it's been on a non stop tear for 2 weeks.
This is gonna be a cataclysmic drop when it happens

‚ÄúBut but but, the experts said it would preserve wealth!‚Äù
Nuts to butts
If given mommy and daddy‚Äôs credit card, buy RBLX. It can‚Äôt go tits up.
And on relatively low volume. It‚Äôs üçå
you can naysay, but the logic is pretty obvious to me.

products / services vary in their contribution to net inflation. College (lowest attendance in years this year), Medical (unsure about status of this), and Childcare costs contribute a lot to the experienced inflation rate for your common man and ladyboy. And expectations of future inflation are the primary driver of actual inflation.

I suppose you could argue that shifting the spending from childcare will inevitably just end up somewhere else, and that would be a fair rebuttal.

but you didn't say that, you just naysayed and insulted, and that makes you a big fat pussayyyy
Just did.  But I doubt it will hold it eod.

NIO is killing me. How is it priced like LCID!?
Irrelevant. You‚Äôre a vagina and you would never have held. Your sweaty palms were shaking when you paper handed those calls and you‚Äôd do it all again

Yes, terrible investment advice.  Only marginally better than "investing" in stuff you hear about on WSB.
TSLA 1200 next week ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëüöÄüöÄüöÄ
have 3 of those and up 100% already from a couple dayz ago
took some NVDA profits before it ran up another point shit regretting it already but at least i have another 250c
MSFT has hit its ATH like 8 times today. People want to short this stock? How do the crayons taste! Lol

What did your money do to you to make you hate it so much?
Thanks for the hopium friend. I dont want fully out but I've averaged down so much I just want to get back to where I was. Like 4-5% allocation is the goal, sitting at like 40% rn
That moment you realize those Tesla shares you sold March last year would be worth $2.3m today
Well November is typically a very green month and with the run up we just had, I was imaging a small pullback at the start of November followed by an even bigger bull run
Get in OCGN before it‚Äôs too late
I stopped selling calls on anything WSB.  I missed out one too many times.  So now I just rotate selling puts and rotate 1/2 in held stock and 1/2 selling puts.
wtf wrong with $snap? do people not send nudes now?
dwell on it. ill remind you tomorrow
Low volume on Krispy Kreme and hit an ATL. This shit is about to pop off
Yes
Ugh V brought my account down by like 30%. At least they have until March expiry
The RSI on some of these equities lmao
Yep, it seems obvious to do that just like a couple days ago. I give up. If I add to puts or roll forward today the market will just go up through Wednesday and the headline will be, ‚Äúnew market records despite fed tapering announcement.‚Äù
They must not report it? Do they tell mr. Wall Street that it‚Äôs a one time thing and they‚Äôll never do it again?
Made $140 today but I lost 30k over the last 3 weeks lol
After 4 day trades, so I get insta banned ?
just saw a diagram on google about rebalancing your portfolio that suggests rebalancing your stock allocation into bonds when stocks go down and rebalancing your bond allocation to stocks when stocks go up. 

So buy high and sell low is what they‚Äôre saying? 
plus who even buys bonds anymore, 150 year old skeletons?
no, 11/5 exp ü§°
Chappelle lmao
Just another .5% would be great

/u/CheckurHealth (0/1) made a bet that AAPL would go to 150.0 when it was 146.57 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Why don't you tell me that rent control lowers rents next?
Might sell half my position before close and let the other half go into next week. Playing it by ear atm.
I've come to the conclusion that no amount of real bad information can bring this market down. It might actually be the only market in history that just keeps going up. They've finally done it. The perfect market. Where every dip is bought and every FUD piece is fake news.
Guessing this means you‚Äôre kicking all of us $SPY-tards off the daily discussion?

I'm glad they do because I make the majority of my money selling them.
Its like the mms heard me
Since last year stock splits were announced at most one month after earnings. These are facts. Elon during the last shareholder meeting said they don't exclude the possibility of a split in the future (when the stock was below $800). Elon wants all employees to be able to buy stocks, which is how he motivates them to do insane end of quarter delivery pushes. In employee programs you don't have fractional shares, hence those not earning high enough salaries there won't be able to participate in the program to get TSLA shares at, usually, a discount. Then finally Elon simply hates shorts (check out his latest tweets), he just waits for Zack to give him the green light to pull the trigger and fukk all of you ghey bers and make memes out of you.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
That only missed because of supply issues. Otherwise they blow away earnings. Q1 will be historic.

Tesla $1200 next week.

Emerging Market stocks are so fucking bad - holy shit
Get some clean pee bro!
if you look at the bill contents, they are actually telling the truth.

for instance, they are capping childcare to 7% of income (which is fucking weird and communistic in my opinion). This is deflationary for poors only though, because the rich are paying extra for that.
Look at UPST
BABA down $148 over the year. Buy the dip?
I was born downs
I wish that‚Äôs what it was. It‚Äôs usually just me looking for a small 40 cent pullback next thing you know I‚Äôve got my entire account in it.
you simply buy low and sell high
That's just bullshit, all my stoner friends have a much better work ethic than I do and I don't smoke.  Just don't ask them to find their keys.

That's good to hear. My degree is electrical engineering but in IT now. Was even approached for recruitment by Microsoft and felt inadequate and the guy straight up told me they didn't care and explained it as they almost prefer I didn't have one because they can just to train you into the worker for themselves, instead of becoming a worker for myself. This applied to GOOG too iirc.

the spy dip is so bullshit. If it was a real slaughter it would move quickly to an extreme low, then pump slowly into EOD, rocket up at some point, then slaughter back down in the last 15 min to be carried over into monday. Instead it's bleeding out in pennies only to pump EOD or open higher monday or something. it's too obvious of a play rn

would it be dumb to take out a personal loan to buy tsla?

Try a diagonal spread. Worked pretty well for me today. Just sell an ATM or just OTM call against your long if you‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs going to go down.

I sold the 460 against my long call last night. Both my long call position and my short call position went in my favor.

CAR is the biggest short opportunity in the market right now. And HTZZ is still buyable. Likely will be purchased by Uber, relegating CAR to an also ran in the TSLA / robotaxi fleet management race.

why doesnt TSLA just buy uber and cut out the middle?
don't sell covered calls on these 5x-10x stocks, it's not worth it. I have a large position in TLRY, it's just dead money sitting there but when federal legalization, it'll go up 5x-10x and more if we're lucky, that's the end game, not some stupid covered call.
TWLO is SO expensive still. has to hit 250 at some point.
What to do about these covered calls that went deep in the money? I was selling LCID CC with a strike of $26 and an exp of November 12 with the hope of avoiding assignment. Now I am deep ITM and I still want to keep my shares, what should I do?

OCGN LET'S GOOO üöÄ
Its MAMAA retard
Given how TSLA keeps slowly creeping up and consolidating ever since the monday Gamma ramp back up to ATH, we could see a repeat of short term call buyers blow TSLA to $1200+ by next week. Seems like MM can barely hold it under $1100...
Bought one months on roku. Stop dumping you slut.
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/jhettman** bet **BABA** goes from **164.18** to **180.0** before **2021-11-12 13:51:08.010328-04:00**
RIP baba.
I feel like it always has a sell off a few weeks before earnings then a couple days before earnings it starts to climb

Atleast that's what I tell my DIS calls
Spy bounce stronger than the feds money printer
That's soft, try real leather instead
Nvda and tsla into next week.   Tsla not going past 1100 today.  Next week.
I couldn't agree more man. Could not agree more.
crazy we can‚Äôt even hang a -.1% day or it‚Äôll get bought

Glad I switched my 0 dte calls to puts. just feels like a dumper from here on out
Ha gayyyy!
Mr. Market says happy Halloween
Yeah thats it then. Had exactly the same thing, kinda scary but I had it checked out and it's nothing serious. You're fine just try and get some carbs into you before you go drinking next time or whilst drinking. Empty stomach and booze dont mix. Thing is I had done it loads of times in the past before the exact same thing you are describing happened. Like my teeth were making a load noise they were chattering so bad I was worried it was like a neuro problem or something as shaking like crazy.

Looking at you, HOOD
Cloud segment seems to have showing good growth so far this quarter, any good cloud tickers have earning next week?
And then reality hit the bulls, it was all just a trap.
Just gonna keep adding on this ROKU dip for next week
F broke out today over 17 . They going to jam it higher into close. 17 calls huge volume
Done
SPY gonna fuck us end of day. Big shit incoming
Good deal for RKT

wait for BABA to drop a bit more before selling puts and closing EOD
Set them up, knock em down. Every damn day.

Tesla had 45% of options trades this week with the other top 9 bringing that to 70%. So if you are playing options it was easy to lose money. Or shares in the wrong companies.

Say DWAC for example.
I'M down over $160k on WISH and probably another $50k - $100k on other stocks

BUT I AINT FUCKING QUITING OR LEAVING
RKT be like fuck your covered calls. God damn
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
Ocgn good weekend hold
Got 189 shares of OCGN do I sell before the weekend while I‚Äôm still up ?
Bloomberg was talking about something being as high as it was since March 2020.  Don't know what as I wasn't fully paying attention.  So I bought PUTS.
Yeah its annoying but im still confident that oil isnt slowing down anytime soon
üë®üèª‚Äçü¶Øbeen looking all day

Just bought back in two hours ago.  Very pleased.
I play too hard with money with a lot of fucking money I ain't willing to lose, I AM A FUCKING ANIMAL.
Most people making bank from Tesla etc were also a bagholder once. RKT is so cheap right now. P/E IS Like 5-6 loads of companies in the hundreds now. Even if it was in SPY it would have the 4th lowest P/E ratio and they print money. If your goal is 18 you should be out soon
Good job. Ballsy reward for a ballsy play

Huh kinda surprised the sector is down, my xom calls are up today even with earnings
You really have no idea how this works, the correction was in Sept, the last rally started after when everything jumed into new aths.

There is no more support for rallies, and the tapering makes that even more clear. Money is leaving the market for months, what do you think was holding things up? Retail?
Time stamp this, I wouldn‚Äôt be in if Pete Najarian wasn‚Äôt

Hey guys, anyone of you using etoro so i can copy you? üòÖ
There was not support at open leading to hops for SPY and TSLA yet strangely something later on pushed both upward. Artificial pump.

If you are smart don't hold, both Tsla and SPY will drop by end of day. (SPY may last a few minutes longer since it trades until 4:15.) Bookmark this post.

This should be obvious since 5 of the last six trading days had that happen to SPY for similar reasons, now TSLA is also on the fumes. 

Next week will be red, all resistance levels will push downward. May or may not start on Monday   
but the hints will start their regardless as we enter Nov.

We had the Sept correction and this is the end of the last rally expected after that. A rally consolidated to 23 stocks in terms of movement and volume (excluding bots). 

Get really for the rollercoaster ride down after reaching the top.



...

With that being said continue to make money until 3:30 today. That's when I'm selling and shifting to hedges myself.

Sentiment catalyst.  It's where the nations make pledges/commitments on reducing their carbon emissions.  Renewable energy production is a large part of meeting that goal.

And this year's comes at a good time.  Countries have been failing their emissions goals badly, natural disasters have caused giga inflation for agricultural products, energy shortages abound.  Bound to generate some good tailwinds.
I sold out at $180

If it hits $200 I might have to go back in because it won‚Äôt stop. I was/am waiting to see if it comes back down to $150-60 levels
What‚Äôs the BABA news?

MSFT on steroids this week and I am totally here for it
Bro i had a 1010C 12/17 tsla which i sold for 450% profit, which was about $6500 profit but now it‚Äôs at $13k. Shit happens, don‚Äôt be a bitch like me. Lol
Once the full details of the deal set in it might just be lambo time :)
Drill tsla drill I wanna see sub 900 by Monday
Spent the last of my my buying power on spy leaps for Jan 2022

10 520c lets go üá∫üá∏
Last chance before it stays above 1100 for good.  get in while you can
The whole idea of the metaverse is so fucking retarded imo lol, like im too busy living in the real world to watch Beatrice bitch about the weather in VR
Fear and loathing in Las Vegas. All in Gamestore, Tesla, popcorn. The bigger the cult. The stronger the stock.
looks like a Friday sq ee ze might be incoming on Sofi. If that bank charter was leaked this could get fun
They will. He wants more people to be able to afford it. Then if I want to sell some I don't need to sell so much. 5:1 would be pretty great.
Is it just me or is Nikola about to overtake Tesla in production by 2024?
On?
&gt;You ever post something üî• and some ü§° copies you minutes later? no, you?
TSLA finally gonna weigh on SPY?
Who else remembers when spy was $427?!
we all just sitting here watching nvda fly, sadge
Yeah I noticed. I was planning on waiting eod but I got too eager. I‚Äôm waiting and going longer into nov just next week too
Praying for us boys
BAN BET $TSLA $1150 by next Monday 11/01/21
Selling lucid to buy Tesla calls at close. I bet Tesla will try to steal lucids weekend thunder by announcing bullish news.
GWH going to run next week? I think so
Imagine shorting Tesla at 1K lmfao
Sounds like a boomer to me
MSFT coming for 330
NKLA is the god company bro, you just can‚Äôt see it yet
29 October 2021 . The day many new bagholders are created
Fool me once
BBBY is down almost 40% from a couple months ago. That‚Äôs a better deal than the 20% off coupon I‚Äôve been getting for years and using as fireplace paper.
Can i still sell contracts after 3pm on rh?
I know. and the bottom is the part you can time, the top is harder to time. but real life is survival I guess.
If I opened a 0dte put credit spread and everything expires worthless, is Robinhood going to force it to close? Or let it expire? And will that count as two day trades? Even if it just expires worthless?

Nikola is literally a scam. Bruh what is this market üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Can you imagine the chaos caused by it selling off big here then pumping into close?
Shame on you ugly dumb morons who inspired me to try some calls this week. You made me gain $14K on TSLA. Love to you all and Papa Elon. 

Now I need to know what to play next week.
And there it is.....recall.
It's up barely anything from January $900. I think the S&amp;P is still outperforming it on the year. Lots of room to go IMO.
Lol they better split by then
Nice dad. Mom said come home soon, we need that milk and she stopped smoking so no need to grab get cigarettes.

VRAR Glimpse Group: Glimpse Group (NASDAQ: VRAR) has an appropriate ticker for stocks mentioned in this article covering both augmented reality and virtual reality.

You went in too early, but were at the top of the range now

You'll be aight
Well there is a reason this time and a great partnership
think of tesla like cult/religion and the new market vix.

&gt; Yes.
SPOT just released LIVE.LOVE.A$AP on streaming.  
  
Calls.
I swear to god if LCID goes up‚Ä¶.fuck my puts
If I use 60k margin to reach 100 shares of Tesla and then sell a covered call for today $1,090 for $1465, that should net me $200 profit if it sells today right?
12/31
And just like that nikola up massive and Milton drowning in fat girl pussy again!
Make some noise for rkt
TSLA $2k by new years.
Quick Bears! SPY is at an ATH again!  You will definitely be right this time!  Buy puts!!!

When you \*should\* buy
So many hype stocks set to report next week, will be wild, want to see some big red like TWLO did.
If they ever split the stock again lmfao I‚Äôd fucken die
tsla casually up $150 in a fucking week, $314 on the month

totally sustainable
NET still going up. Who knew.

Bought sofi and ocugen. See you in the weekend thread
I‚Äôm down 500 so far. Yeah it‚Äôs a great idea if you hate money
agree, needs to split, asap.
That‚Äôs cause when it‚Äôs about to someone says, Whadda iffa dey splittta the stocckkaah?
Me too son
I'm getting fucked today, and I don't like it
Is $PYPL actually cheap or at a low?
TSLA WILL NOT TOUCH 1200 NEXT WEEK RED ALL WEEK üòâ @LG0$
There is a company called AUPH trading just under $32 right now. It will be bought out in the next 30 days for around $50. Trust me. I'm from the future.
Awwww shit.. whole market bouta fly boys
sold at 1094, i agree haha
I kick myself inhad 30 220c I sold all but 1 for MSFT, which made me a good amount
I‚Äôm
Betting on it, literally
Pretty sure no, but I'm still gonna keep chasing the imaginary dollar of my hallucinations
Boomers cumming their pants rn
I don't understand what is wrong with my boy V he should be 300 by now
If Tim Apple and Jeff Bozos wake up SPY can hit 460 today
they are value traps, they are so overvalued that even after dipping so much they're still priced in for 3 years
Only thing im still holding thats not bright green is these fucking GUSH calls üòíüòí
Up 62% on $BROS.  Dutch Bro Mafia will continue to print!

If you ain't loading up on QQQ puts today, what are you even doing
Fear is generally when you buy
Fuck it. Let‚Äôs just meme tesla to #1 marketcap company
Okay Nio‚Ä¶ stop taking a break now and go play again
The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell.
How would COP26 help solar?
Yeah I‚Äôve been waiting for a shitting day for the past two weeks lmao
Get divorced to split holdings between spouses to avoid paying taxes on it, smart move
If this keeps up it'll be $1500 EoY
TELSA STOCK IS TOO HIGH IMO
LETS GOOOOO
Honestly any type is better than white women
Lcid, it‚Äôs your time now to üöÄ
Apple will dip below $149, then straight to 151
The salesforce deal should be massive for RKT. Nothing like signing a massive deal with an almost 300bn dollar company to hopefully get the share price where it should be and lighten some bags :)
Let's see if it holds.
Wut is that candle on SOFI
If PYPL bounces off support at 230 we might test 270 but if we break past it then we‚Äôre seeing 180-220 range
Ahh yes Bill Madoff.
Atleast another 10% FREEDOM BRUTHER
I nabbed some 1300 11/12 less than 10 minutes ago and theyre already up 9%

Highly recommend
Solar quietly paying ppl tendies all month.  Most of them haven't even reported earnings yet and COP26 has yet to begin.
Just one more 0dte! I swear it's the last one!
Lmao big gay
I drank some coffee, my neighbor's dog barked.
If you bought at the money leaps expiring today, you would have made like 100x your money.
I was thinking about buying tqq &amp; upro, but ditched the idea because volatility would probably ruin the run.

It seems stupid... But at this point with Tesla..who even knows

Was this in your tea leaves?
SPY down by 1 pm sure didn't age well from that retard
So Tesla break 1100, LCID poised to break 40
My hobbies include buying puts at the bottom, and losing money
Why did you get banned
Be reasonable,  its gonna gonna hit 500

SPY puts from here on out for me. wtf is this
Apple $155 EOD
Idk. When he said he wants Apple back, I was wondering what he was smoking.
Rock n roll
The trick is to buy the stock before it has ‚Äùa great run up‚Äù, impossible, I know, but that‚Äôs the trick.
since i'll be banned all next week let me say now fuck whoever told me to buy these V calls
yes. then came corona and everything has been going up since then pretty much
I'm down for 125 by next week too
Was ridiculous. Buy. 

Then absurd. Buy. 

Now surreal. Sell.
Threw money at ocgn top. Potential RIP
Congrats to all TSLA holders. New ATH. More gains to come.
If you bought SPY at the bottom of the Covid crash last March, you would have about 2x'd your money today.
TSLA 1120 by end of day
Congrats and‚Ä¶
UDMY publicly trading today pretty poggers
Deal with Salesforce
TDA. They‚Äôre recalling 2700(lol) vehicles for suspension issues
New ceo is certainly more capable than the old CEO though, and a company this big is unlikely to fail forever. 12 gen looks better and gpus could make inroads in the market. High 40s seems undervalued to me - PE is way lower than nvda or amd.
Some pita lmao puts*
damn, cash out &amp; retire
Wtf wrong with NIO why it cant pass 42 ?

Wait where did you see the recall?
Bruh amd fucking me raw out here but I'm hopeful

125 by next week.
Very.
Bought a MSFT call to slowly get back into options trading.

New strategy is no more puts on anything, shit burns me all day. At least MSFT is helping me out

TSLA wants to go up so bad but the mm trying to crush everyone
The year is 2090, President-for-life Donald Trump Jr. Jr., who started his tenure in 2060, has been tasked with overseeing the incoming asteroid which has been estimated to wipe out 69% of the world. With news of imminent impact, SPY rises a record 42.0% to hit a new all time high of 69420. 

"How can it keep going up!?" exclaimed Burry's prodigy. "Don't you realize? We're all about to die!! This is literally the time to sell! What the fuck!!!!"

A faint voice replies "Not all of us, only the gay bears will die". Can it be? It is! Powell's great great grandson. The living legend himself. The YOLO'er who turned $100 into $100 trillion just by buying weekly SPY calls. 

Upon further inspection of the asteroid, it appears that it's actually a giant rocket. There's writing on the side of it... X √Ü A-12 Industries.

Without hesitation, the rocket blows up, sending millions of heat-seeking missiles toward the great USA. Boom! Boom! Boom! One by one, bears are blown to smithereens. The market dips 0.1% and immediately CNBC and WSJ issue press releases that this is the dip we've all been waiting for! Buy buy buy!

tl;dr SPY calls
Not really actually.
Tessy gang where you at üëÄ

Wonder how the guy that shorted TSLA is feeling right now...
Don‚Äôt do INTC it is in a death spiral. CEO talking nonsense
Tesla finally breaks through 1100. Onwards and upwards you bastard!
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

Are people really dumb enough to think that FB changing its parent name is due to embarrassment about a few reports that came out weeks ago?

*read that again*
Is spy gonna deny $460 again like on Wednesday?
Yeah I did earlier this week, I'm a little nervous, since this conference was supposed to be the catalyst, but maybe they'll ... I dunno, whip out the big dick next week? Calls are 11/19 so I can still scrape out without losing too much.

That doesn't matter when QE is running, during march we were literally shut down, earnings were cratering, unemployment was through the roof, and stocks were going up the entire time thanks to infinite QE

Any AAPL dip is a gift. Why punish the ultimate money making machine in human history for a hiccup out of its control?
Bought a couple VISA calls when it was at 217 because some guy posted about going all in on them after its fall from 250ish and well, at least he‚Äôs suffering more than I am

The meeting was going great until I noticed how soulless Bob's avatar looked. Black eyes, like a doll's. Void-like, but highly erotic. I know he's waiting for me to plunder his holes. Also, Charlotte's arm started to clip through her torso. That was weird.

because you basically need a data scientist/analyst to use the product. That's why people think theyre a consulting firm - because of the FDEs they send. FDE stands for forward deployed engineers - essentially on-site/client-facing data consultants who help them leverage the platform. They built software so ahead of its time you need them to use it.
Looks like the big guys all have billions sitting in cash just buying buying buying.

Been there
I'm at max day trades on Robinhood, but I'm still in one position I bought this morning as of now. US Steel. Should I go full retard, sell and get my account flagged or be respectful and hold over the weekend? Either way when I sell my X it'll be the last transaction I make on Robinhood, I'm making the full switch to TD and might open an account with fidelity as well to get more trades. Thoughts?

Edit: not options, I got bored this morning after I smoked a morning bowl and bought some shares just to see what would happen. Nothing crazy, 15 shares. I normally trade on TD but I still had leftover cash in my Robinhood account and the boredom got the best of me.
Yeah not hitting 130 is disappointing. I bought some 135c 11/5 lottery tickets though. I'm hoping it will have the same 10+% run in a week like what happened some days after the last ER. There has got to be a bunch of upgrades coming with that good of an ER.

You can make just as much if not more money from the implied volatility of stock and just selling the premuim you pay for the call at a profit. This is what i do.
We should make buying spy calls the lame thing to do.

With all the big earnings out of the way: misses from the biggest chonks, world wide supply issues, GDP miss, inflation hurting consumer purchases, the only direction I see now is UP. Fucking keep buying until the Feds stop printing. With the GDP miss, the Feds hand has already been forced - already expecting a delay in taper from November to December. December to January. January to February. Guess what? Jerome Powell's tenure ends February 2022, that is the only time to buy puts. He'll probably spend the rest of 2022 testifying to congress lmao

Because if you take 2% of someones net worth when they dont hold that much liquidity, they have to sell assets, which drives the price down, which causes them to sell more assets to continue to cover, which then drives the price down more. Meanwhile, the market will react to this, selling off to save their own gains. Its a whirlwind down that would cause a market crash, which would be fine if it only hurt financial institutions and the ultra wealthy, but if you crash the boomers and Gen X retirement accounts youre basically guarenteeing a Trump or Desantis white house, which i dont want.

We already had an effective tax on the wealthy, its just been whittled down since the 70s, if we restored the top marginal tax rate top 70-90%, closed off-shore loopholes, and closed a shit ton of other tax loopholes, mainly real estate related, itd fix a lot more. 

Also, the new tax law is not going to pass, period. Its political theater by the Dems to make it look like they want to do something while actually accomplishing nothing. My only hope is that its a move to push the center into being more accepting of Bidens more conventional initial proposals. Taxing assets that have fluctuating prices by the second based on buy/sell offers is retarded and theyre using the general publics ignorance to get brownie points knowing it wont work.
Ah yes, the daily melt up.
$AAPL really gonna crawl back up to $150, isn't it?

(Probably like $149.8x but I count that as a win because I'm not a retard who buys weeklys).

yea but im not selling calls rn cuz of the volatility with earnings and the upcoming merger, so im stuck making money on the underlying going up. i was making 4k a week selling calls so i need the stock to go up by that much or i am effectively losing money. once the merger goes through ill start selling calls again. china phase 3 and/or the phase 2 60 day extension ends early december, so not too much longer. im really just pissed we havent gone to 130 on earnings

Why?
Power Etrade is good. But all brokers require you to have 25K ($25,000) in order to day trade freely.
There really is no top.
sell half? this is clearly a short slaughter and anyone doubling down at 459 and 460 is up for slaughter too which implies a pump to 461 and maybe open 464 monday just to really blow up some assholes

As a Production Supervisor with a MS in Strategic Leadership that worked my way from bottom up in an International Plastics Manufacturing Facility, I can tell you the Fed's actions have caused the supply chain problems, which in turn caused inflation.  

When a company can't retain workers because they are getting paid to stay home, company raises wages but supply still declines because training is needed to improve efficiencies.  In addition, when people are given enough stimies to stay home and spend and pay their bills, most will not care about increased wages  because they have no ambition and no foresight as to what will happen 40 years from now when they need to retire.  Our production facility in VA just became fully staffed after being 50% staffed prior to Oct. 6.  However, all of our senior techs are now retiring so we can't keep the machines running in order to achieve efficiencies.  IF the Fed had not printed all the money in order to spend it on all the stimies this year but allowed business to operate normally, then we would have qualified personnel to run the plant efficiently by now.

But to your point, my minor is in Accounting and we think Economists are really stupid.

BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Meta has another 25% of growth before it even reaches price targets, are you dumb? Take my goddamned money! üí∞

Why not just buy with cash if you think you might have to sell same day?
#THATS ALOTTA DAMAGE
What do you think about the upcoming earnings on the 4th moon or tank
Inflation is exactly why I‚Äôm buying spy calls. We‚Äôre trading the nominal value, not the real value.

I trade mine on IV alone. I wont come close to expiration. We should both win. SPY should dip next week at some point
Just heard the following from an inside source:

"Tesla stock price is too high imo"

Sorry not really interested in buying your bags
best believe baby
I think they scale pretty quickly. When Tesla come out nobody was even talking electric cars. Today, they are widely adopted and gaining momentum.
So i can just exit from my positions without any problems right?
So the metaverse is basically SecondLife with a VR headset, right? And we're all going to move there? And stop doing things in real life? Right?
TMC has leaps ü§°
Good chance but definitely not guaranteed. There are plenty of risks out there. Either way, not sure what that has to do with your statement about fair value.

Either i wipe my NVDA gains or double it with META. lets go ZUCK
Feels like an inverse V coming up on SPY

nvda is unstoppable. I was hoping AMD would be a better bet with a fraction of a PE ratio.
All that is going to happen is that apple makes their business model implode and all They‚Äôre left with is some crazy goggles men use for porn.

The best the bears could come up with is supply chain issues and wage inflation and that couldn't even make Amazon negative on the week. All time highs very soon.

Have they announced when they plan on reducing the SPY stock. I must have missed that tweet
New record for SPY even with AMZN and AAPL down. Incredible!
This pump is lamer than the one I tried to give my wife last month.
Me too. What advice do you have?
So I‚Äôll just let it mark me as a pattern day trader and sell my positions?

Is it wise to buy the spy 460 call rn or wait till minutes before close ?
MSFT most valuable company
How long u gonna hold it for?
do you think amzn 0dtes right now will print? debating it
Spy going up until 2022
Amzn wants to be green I can feel it in my plums
get a room, you guys!
Fb doesn't solve any problems either, lol.
Market wants to go up despite amzn. I think everything rally is incoming because of season. Don't be afraid to buy
Telsa didnt ipo at a market cap of 50 billion I can tell you that
Would be hilarious if aapl and amzn close green today LFG
If it‚Äôs your first time they will let you restart your day trades
is November usually a bad or good month for the markets ?
Stocks green

Vix green

Why am I such a pussy.  Already up 10 percent on AAPL leaps.  Should have bought more
I just picked up 10 shares of ZEN.
FUCK YOU SPY PUT HOLDERS
Big gamble is will LCID be able to scale production and get their OPEX down. Their only car is like $135,000 right? TSLA was flat for like 8 years before the boom. Not saying LCID will fail, just that it's got a long way to go to come anywhere close to TSLA.
no, but I do remember "Roku make you Broku"

Wow these DWAC options are pricey
Thinking too small.
aapl calls printing.
So I guess grabbing weekly QQQ calls was the right move at open. Nice to see some green for a change, especially after losing my ass on SPY puts last week. Never again.
NVDA is a fucking beast
Taper flash crash incoming lmao
Half BROS Puts say 90%+ chance of profit üòü
Corsair worst company in history
At least half.
Play with house money if holding is my opinion
And I‚Äôm selling my spy calls. I‚Äôm a big ‚ÄúSpy Only goes up‚Äù guy, but any idiot buying spy at this price with inflation the way it is and tapering happening from here on out deserves to lose money.
The main investment podcast i like has stayed high on them (of course, theyre long term share holders, not buying monthlies like a degenerate) and so i stayed with them while selling my CLF and X positions

In summary: I eat glue
I‚Äôll see. I‚Äôm a repeat offender so maybe I don‚Äôt count.
what a run for lending club
GREE finally. Still need some more though
Why are we green though why why why
I love how bulls celebrate a .01% day like they‚Äôve won or something??

Teslatober. Up 40% this month. Take a breather or $10 a day would be nice as well.
Dare you Apple!
Okay, okay, I‚Äôll do it‚Ä¶. What‚Äôs up dog?

&gt; I think that the massive run into earnings was pricing in a beat and raise. Everyone knew they would not miss by more than people thought they would so now everyone is taking profits. You were late to the play, but you are right about one thing: I am indeed very late to this party

Treat your options account like an investing account and do boomer shit like dollar cost averaging but on LEAPs and monthlies, not on stocks. You'll make pretty decent gains that way if you choose stocks that are on a long-term uptrend.

SPY in a big ascending triangle; if it breaks out, which it‚Äôs attempting right now, we‚Äôll probably see new ATHs once again. If it fails to, we‚Äôll bounce down to somewhere deeper into the triangle for more consolidation.

Nah. Its just a generational thing: Millenials and Gen Z just stream music, boomers still buy it. It doesn't represent a new market or anything. 

We've seen from other right wing social media platforms like Gab and Parler that actually launching something like this isnincredibly difficult. Your user base needs to migrate over, to convince them that they should give up their existing platforms is not an easy thing to do, and there is no easy way to monetize it.

Plus, these platforms inevitably get overrun with Nazis and altright types, which lead to bans from the major providers. This has no future.
Should have sold lucid fuck me

Venmo it to me. Ill invest it for you. Totally legit.

I'm just saying, I hope it goes to 5 million / sh personally
If you bought it far back enough, the expectations that the stock could go higher than that were itself higher, and thus the option premium is higher. Right now you‚Äôre learning the cold, sore anus of being fucked by theta decay. We all have. Now you‚Äôre truly one of us.

I‚Äôm not an expert on JMIA but emerging market positions are very exposed to interest rate risk.

If you want to hold long term you should sell covered calls against your shares at a price you feel comfortable selling at.

If you still believe in the stock and your thesis is unchanged then by all means stick it out.
Nice, love it
Quick question 

Who are the best to follow on Twitter for valuable market info of quick Buy&amp;Dump?
Should have known market would go green based an all the negative sentiment on CNBC front page.
Fine. I took the 11/19 expiration though cause there is no volume in the 11/12s. 670 strike.... Now I'm taking off and starting my weekend
Give it a little more time
They meant the lesson,  not the gain.
I agree with you about the idiots part. I thought the 7 percent was just the start. Wasn‚Äôt enough. Dips still being bought instantly. We are in full bubble mode
I hope but I doubt it with my luck
Def risky. Monday might open pretty flat or barely green I think we‚Äôll start to retrace some mid next week
Hopefully no one

AMC ready for take off üöÄ
We literally had a 7% dip 2.5 weeks ago you retards.

We‚Äôre coming off the dip and heading into nov/dec (seasonally spy‚Äôs strongest months)

WSB is full of legit idiots lol
So the only time SPY cares about what AAPL is doing is when I hold calls
Let's go spy!!
If you make up a fake company then yeah, thats why you need to have a buddy (or uncle or some shit) that actually owns a company so when they call him he can vouch for you. HR will call just to verify that you worked there.

If you don't know anyone, you can bullshit and say you were self employed doing freelance work or some shit.

They can't tell you are lying in an interview or on the job unless you are obvious about it.
For real lol
It's gonna go lower.
Longterm though I do have conviction in the company, would you really recommend cementing an unrealised loss?

Welcome to your first lesson on IV crush
&gt; You are a hedge fund manager. You have no idea what you're doing and your clients hate you for it.
Time for SPY to reject $458 and start drilling through close.

Let's get this ber party started!
Imagine being up $80% on your 0DTE $QQQ calls and Amazon is still down -100 pointsü•∞ü•∞
i keep seeing people say that the fact that we're at all time highs suggests that stocks are overvalued right now

actually it suggests that historically stocks have been insanely undervalued

few understand this

Now that I‚Äôve switched to calls, if SPY could hit 460 today that would be just great
Anybody holding TSLA puts over the weekend
‚ÄòMurica
Looks like something that would align with my personal risk tolerance. Needs options though.
I'm holding, just not happy about it.

ho ho ho wait until the REAL rally starts in November. You bers won't have assholes left to gape.
cause the market is rigged. High oil prices, low rates. No one cares.
Go AMZN go pump it daddy bezos. Back to $3460 in 3 weeks. Going to be a merry fucking Christmas indeed
I keep buying SPY puts and losing money. Is this what it feels like, to never learn? ü§°
Eat it all. You got there first lol
probably  is many factors at play, lollapalooza effect. 

I think places like silk road played their role in the beginning,  and pure insane speculation probably is the last factor,  but who the fuck knows how insane it can get.  how many times it can go from speculation &gt; legitimate use &gt; speculation &gt; other legitimate use etc etc.
would love a ride
faceb...meta will be a 100 trillion dollar company
Where all my CLNE bagholders at?
I'm not worried, as of now the majority of my holdings are not retarded and aren't up much from pre-pandemic (holding 75% V, SBUX, &amp; MCD)

AMC üöÄ‚ù§Ô∏è
I don't think it's going down 10% anytime soon.
I‚Äôd love to see a 20 percent fall until 2022
Come on AAPL. No more edging. Time to COOM
Still overvalued by about 50%
glad I sold my calls at open
After the horrific trades I made this week, I forgot I‚Äôm holding a lot of amc how about a face ripping rally?

Tim üçé trying to create subscription based revenues rather than truly innovating is why TSLA will eventually replace them as the largest company in the world

Ready to give up on NIO.  Below 40 yet again.
The weed guy finally turned up üò©
Alright SPY let's see that rug pull baby
AMZN actually increased revenue YOY. profits are only down due to hiring, bonuses and supply chain issues/higher costs of goods. Their retail business is small compared to their cloud hosting service as well. If you zoom out AMZN has been flat for a year and most of these points were already priced in. AMZN is massive and will be in very good shape for a very long time.

Amazon cloud services is carrying the company now. Not the retailer biz
Already priced in. Economic activity reduction due to delta was expected.

It's also evidence that inflation will resolve over time since GDP's arc reduction means that capital velocity and consumer spending are down, which are the real measures of future inflationary pressure, not M1 and M2 like all the amateurs use. Bullish given the context, barring more COVID affect or some other external crisis, since the resolution of delta and reduced economic activity means more likelihood that supply chain disruptions are resolved and demand declines a bit.
Boomer play. T so cheap
&gt; You are not alone. The Fidelity Active Trader Pro software is the most annoying piece of shit on earth, and it's why I use Interactive Brokers.

Wow. You‚Äôre surprised that spy is doing well during its strongest season (fall/winter) coming off the back of the strongest 1.5 year bull market as well as riding the wave after the October dip.

Ngl I‚Äôm not surprised 90% of the people here lose money
You are right. The tapering itself is reducing the buying of every dip.  AND that rate hike will come sooner than June I think.  The dollar shot up this morning and equities and digital monies both are running.  Makes dickall sense.  Fortunately I got in for puts two weeks out at the very top yesterday.  Might add on today.
Good ol SPY climbing out of her blood bath this morning
Not even noon and we hit $458, $459-$460 next

&gt;I got my math degree last year but am still working at a restaurant.

thats your issue

recruiters are gonna see that you graduated and didnt get a job and then throw your resume in the trash

just lie on your resume, if you have any buddies or know someone that owns a software company, you can put on your resume that you worked for them for a year and then put them down as a reference
Amen, lifting whilst baked feels fuckin great
I usually do the opposite and have only 30% on the table if I think it'll run more.  Learning to take profit is hard and it feels worse to miss potential gains if right and take profits early but you have to get over that shit. Profit is profit and always better than a loss.

hold if you can afford to lose, but sell if you cant? it may just float at 24-28 all week

i have just always, but especially more recently, been hoping that there could be a future in which earning billions and encouraging well being could be mutually beneficial rather than mutually exclusive. i don't think these tech billionaires, and in this instance zuckerberg specifically, are evil like a lot of people think, and i don't even think they're driven purely by profits either, they just have these visions that they're so attached to and driven by, but these visions also have so many unexpected consequences. many of which are very much not good. i kind of feel bad for them (in a way) because they've all become accidental super villains

SU is having a green day today!
Buying AAPL and AMZN 1DTE calls the same day i quit my job was a.... interesting choice to say the least
and to continue with the sofi convo, the price will look like it's not going anywhere and they will force it down the week of earnings. The day before LC earnings, the SP was down 9.88%! It stopped out so many poor idiots, I just added cheap calls. The same thing will happen to sofi. It will gap up to 35 after earnings and never look back. Bank charter doesn't matter. They are getting it not sure when but soon. Then it will double but that has noting to do with the near term.
It does like to pin sometimes.  I'd prefer 1000 though.

No just the cost of 100 contracts for now which ranges from 8k-15k when i cover that cost (account for a loss on something going bad).   Im going to try to go up to 200 and take the same cost range of a then 1600-2k.    


Probably stop there im not looking to get stupid rich and besides the thought of 30k risk to 2k profits is silly enough.  And it would only take half the oppertunities to cover the same profits.

All my good plays were short term and based off of this sub.  Since changing jobs I've had to switch to longer term strategies and I'm not making shit in comparison.
nah, society and food logistics will collapse well before that. can't remember but there was a psychologist that predicted millions of people will detach from reality and exist in virtual space (vidya games) and it played out, her new target was double what it was before. regulations wouldn't and don't matter when it comes to stuff like that, if real life in a civilization isn't worth it, one way or another people will refuse to live it. i don't think mental health issues doubled because of tech, its much more that people found could reasonably unplug and dissociate easier, and that there is more and more of a desire to do so.

I haven‚Äôt looked at their financials, or invested in AMZN, but just being a bystander and looking at their stock over the last year makes no sense to me. Although I guess it‚Äôs very overvalued on a PE basis, so there‚Äôs no reason it should go up if it was already priced for perfection.

SPY: GREEN. DILDOS
Eat a bag of dicks
i'm kind of on the fence here. i think it may be a step in the direction of overcoming the pitfalls of social media when it comes to connection. the actual manifestation of the metaverse is still nebulous so it's difficult to say what kind of appearance it will take, but i could definitely see it as much more humanizing than a facebook/instagram/twitter feed.

i don't think by any means it'll be a cure or a reversal of what social media has done to that construct, but i'm not so sure it's as damning as you predict
SPY w the v shape, told you boys. Here comes the bull run to $500 EOY

https://ibb.co/n3Rt7Pr
lol. Okay man. I do think we have a Christmas rally, but if Powell were to surprise everyone by tapering early or something, the chart wouldn‚Äôt matter. Neither would the OI. 

Like I said, I do think we have a big rally leading up to the new year. My point is just that the things that you seem to think of as surefire indicators are not as solid as you think.

It's really tempting, but I am not sure - bought OTM calls at last ER and got fucked hard...
I get that but it‚Äôs usually around 8-9$. It can run up to there pre earnings like it‚Äôs done all year. Vroom on the other hand is being done dirty despite crazy growth. Carvana is overvalued but I can def see it going higher
My 13-year-old daughter wanted to do a classic costume this year, she chose to be a ghost. Like just straight up Casper. Literally just a king size white bedsheet with eye holes cut into it. I said fine that sounds easy to make and much better than some other costumes you could've picked. But then once she put it on, it kinda has klan vibes to it and I regret letting her pick that costume.

This whole metaverse thing is a huge progress in technology, but a very dramatic development in humanity. This will seperate people even more than smartphones did. Since the introduction of smartphones and social media from around 2010, mental health illness has doubled. There is no board of directors setting up regulations and limits on these technologies. It's the wild west, where capitalism and earning billions matters way more than wellbeing. In the end, those technologies will consume us entirely without us even noticing it. It's a smart move by facebook, but a terrible move for human kind.

I don‚Äôt think fair elections exist anymore. To be honest I believe that the 2016 election was their first attempt at really manipulating the election and, although, I think Trump legitimately won, I do believe that a lot of the ‚Äúvotes‚Äù that he received were supposed to go to Hillary but, as it were, the manipulators made a few errors and gave some votes to Trump. 
I think they learned from their mistakes and used the same methods in 2020 as they did in 2016, but didn‚Äôt expect the massive turn out that happened. That massive turn out messed up their algorithms which is why, at 3am, Biden found like 1.5 million votes from out of nowhere.  Conservatives were also blocked from going back into the counting halls to observe the counting. 
We have so many liberal outlets because the elites  own those outlets and, to be honest, the few conservative outlets that we do have, I believe, only exist to further the wedge being driven in-between Americans. 
Most of us are moderates but, if you listen to the media, in any form, you‚Äôd think that we are all either far-right or far-left. Those people do exist but not in the majority‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt believe. 
This is why most of us like Trump. Not because we thought he was a saint but because his interests were in America. The man also never took a paycheck for being the president‚Ä¶he didn‚Äôt need it. He donated his checks to charity.

The safest play in my opinion to just buy stock and wait are Cannabis stocks. Dems gotta break ground or the midterms are going to be a disaster since the President can barely speak in public, much less rally and inspire people to vote for him. DNC is a joke for going along with him. Can‚Äôt wait to gladly vote him out of office.

Awhile ago, when DIA started performing and trending more than QQQ, it was clear we were entering the final phase before the kaboom.

Tech has been between 77-85% of the market growth for the big ETFs. The fed, buybacks, and other factors helped.

We are starting to see consolidation, most runner stocks moving 5% or more, around 80% the last 4 months, have been tech. On average of course.

Some weeks ago banks had decent earnings but most didn't move much or fell flat (or down) with only a handful of exceptions.

This technically should be the time banks breakout but they didn't.

Hmmmmm.

https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec&amp;st=w52
&gt; The worlds most profitable company is a system of slavery.
One thing about SPY and QQQ is that they have generally been downtrending for months with money leaving at crucial points, however that didn't stop rallies from breaking upward, so certain elements are literally forcing these to float.

While powell isn't the only reason, the tapering process may be enough on its own to invalidate the other supporting factors and cause spike stairs downward.

Already we had the 10% correction or near in Sept, we got the 9 to 8 channel two weeks ago, and there is a double curved elbow and resistance at $457, this is a zombie etf that's trying to get out the grave but someone keeps hitting it back down with a 457 baseball bat.
Up 25% on OCGN this week. Love to see it.
TSLA calendar spreads have been my bread and butter this week.

Buy a call, wait for it to go up, then sell a higher strike/shorter date call. Watch tesla go mostly sideways, collect theta.
How is the worlds most profitable company overvalued ?

You will understand next week.
man there are some metaverse related stocks blowing up this morning, mostly otc so cant mention tickers but worth doing 2 minutes of googling.
8 years, 11 months and ***21*** days, I opened a Reddit account on the 22nd day and bought SPY calls.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
Lucid pumping back up right now.
Ocgn next floor
üôÑ
dri pop diggy diggy du bah dow
I am thinking about investor day.. that‚Äôs when they came out and said they were digital focused etc etc.
Yup, made a cool 250% in 10 minutes
The market seems to be doing just fine without me staring at it
Is there anything more beautiful than 1015 am reversals? I think not
These buyers just want to keep buying huh. Won‚Äôt let spy just die
Still a good long-term investment. Not built like TSLA like some were jerking yesterday.
META materials made a 15% gain because of daddy Marks metavers announcement LOL wtf.
# Oh bulls of the lake, what is your wisdom?
Might as well grab some NIO right here... just in case.
woah wtf 

who is this UVXY cat?
This largely works because it's such a heavy earnings week.
Shhh
Lol Coke buying BodyArmor - another gross drink
Buy the rumor you dunce
Was never in doubt üòé
Can‚Äôt believe SPY is only down .25% on a day when AAPL and AMZN are getting murdered
Just because FAANG+MSFT+TSLA + oil has been dragging SPY up in the last year doesn‚Äôt mean the market has been doing well.
looks like 36.2, its breaking right now but it barcoded for awhile
It's just FUD from the SEC. By the time the next big dividend comes around, it will be pumping.
139 is were i would load up, unless break that
still probably a decent play to buy $220cs a month or two out.
SPY $459+ eod, 3rd bounce back from support levels
Come on LCID, I need this more than you know
Been saying this for years
Was bag holding $DWAC at 75 but you apes came and got me so I could break even :)
Me too. I was down 75% on NOV 115. Just sold half to cover cost and free rolling the rest. LFG!
GOOD APES BUY LCID
same thing its done the last few days, opening spike then fade to close
Lol why? Shit is going to consolidate now after that earnings run up until merger news comes out.
LCID engaging stage 2 thrusters
Loaded up on $150 11/5. Easy money
It's all fake n guh  
Bleed more SPY, you bitch
457.00
What is support at?
LCID WILL RISE AGAIN
Lol, Exxon bagholders and options players saw the jump ah yesterday and premarket today expecting a rally. Oops.

Best earnings in ~4 years isn't enough I guess
How do they upgrade something and dump it after? wtf?
Use them day trades bro
Surprised lcid didn't fall to 45 yet
0dte puts wont print until after 1pm. They're just gonna pump and flatten until everyone get's murdered by theta and/or gets their options sweeped in robinhood's risk closeouts at 2pm
$BARK is ripping again
Beer cheese, guacamole, hummus... every dip getting bought up.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|surprise)
Tis but a flesh wound

Green by lunch
You're only gonna lose money on lcid players
Waiting to buy LCID as support...
LCID profiters should exit before the weekend, monday is going to be sell-the-news and volume is starting to plummet. If anyone remembers that drop from 70 to 30 on the last big news day üòÖ
I dumped 20% of my AAPL position and averaged up again in MSFT.
1.1 rack
I love when my moves spike premarket so I can sell it all stress free.

If it doesn‚Äôt I was until European close as they either buy the dip or sell the peak - next best time to offload Options.

I then have a rule where I can‚Äôt buy anything until 2 hours before close. Especially on a Friday

It‚Äôs going to be a long day just waiting.

Generally buy the 1 dollar above trading price unless its like say 456.70 ill go with 458. Date is 3/2 days away.  When i was testing things closer DTE was a heavier bleed if things did go sour.  I dont hold that long at all like today i bought at slightly past open and held for 8 minutes.
What is 0day puts?
Ever wonder what you're doing with your life? Besides losing money?
usually I use my diamond hands to watch my positions expire worthless, am I doing it right?
That is definitely not a guarantee
wait are you talking about investor day? i think that held way more weight because they announced their streaming platform. i doubt they have anything that big planned this year
Wow. What else is there to do in solitary beside masturbate? Calls on this guy
üö® AMD BUY ALERT! üö®
as a bear i gotta say‚Ä¶.

good one putting TSLA into SPY‚Ä¶

it‚Äôs gonna work out great
It‚Äôs only been going up since market open
Honestly I hate the fucking stock market sometimes.
Remember when BA was a meme stock and actually went up? Pepperidge farm remembers
It's literally a sell the news event moron
Have you not learned anything from the past month?
Better not.  Thats the one saving me today.
I think that‚Äôs a sign you don‚Äôt know how to invest. But thanks for feeding our gains.
To buy $AAPL calls or not to buy $AAPL calls, that's the question.
Just ducking dump already
SPAC went to $65 before the deal was even in place.  Saudi princes are in this company heavily, LUCIDs will be all over the desert in a decade
Really gotta stop letting plays run right past my face and just hit the buy button.

Risk tolerance has gone to shit.
bro you been riding TSLA's moon mission?
Fuk US Steel earnings was a no brainer, wasn't it?
In and out of the shower to see my boy TSLA absolutely murdered.

Talking about the price action today
Wow including yesterday it‚Äôs septuple top for Fb at 324 zzz
Every LCID run does this .falls flat on its face
Warning to those will $LCID 0dte puts. Stock will probably close flat. Deliveries are Saturday. Roll them till next week and my prediction is at least $27 next week....probably lower.

Tesla calls are the heroin of gambling
At $4 it's a play
Could be that you keep finding the stock during the 'sell-the-news' phase, aka at the top and too late

You should try searching for prospects instead of current bull runs
Really getting fucked by VALE right now.
Lol, two of the most unreliable stocks
Lol golf is for boomers and boring millenials
How do you hold objects with paper hands?
It turns out opening call credit spreads on TSLA any time it got close to $1100 was the play for this week
TSLA always mooning during opening lol then pulling back slightly
I lost too much money buying puts on meme stocks. Gave that up long ago.
Just did it today lol üòÇ
They aren‚Äôt practical for most upper class either

I can safely not play OCGN today because approval is the 3rd and I know damn well they‚Äôre gonna bleed it back to $10 or less by Monday. Then I‚Äôm loading the fuck up

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/FrankMRedington (0/1) made a bet that PYPL would go to 255.0 when it was 245.32 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

/u/-rigga (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1100.0 when it was 1067.21 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
its a literal TSLA competitor
Here's the problem: Santa doesn't take kindly to punters front-running his rally. It's like opening your presents in October, and that's the equivalent of sucker-punching Santa. Santa's revenge will be served cold: no rally for you, front-runners. And nothing in your stocking or under your tree, either.
I stopped looking at any candles shorter than hourlies and somehow mysteriously my crippling anxiety disappeared

weird huh
Hoping to get my future kitty's tendies out of those
Have a feeling I just got trapped and sold my calls at an immediate loss
TSLA sell off then we‚Äôre on our way back up
454.8
Buy NVDA and close app. It‚Äôs simple
X just gonna fall off like that at 10Am? Aight.
They go up?
$VALE is mining metals with AI trucking and supplying Tesla with nickel. SEC poking at them but won't do shit
How many days after bad earnings should one buy the dip? I‚Äôm sure 5/11s for AAPL won‚Äôt print

Tesla hit 1 rack and immediately dumps lol
was a huge catalyst last year...and the presentation was leaked a few days before it was official.
Tesla really propping up SPY. For now..
Thanks, Mayor!

I won't sell anywhere near these prices. I just look at the charts for fun. Not because I would ever consider selling within the next 3 years.
&gt; I'm not a tech guy, but I know people who are.

Just the opposite for me. My Robinhood gambling account down 54%. My Vanguard investing account up 23% for the year...lol

Wtf spy....go up
TSLA double top üìâ
since SPY ranges from 8-15k for 100 contracts, depending on DTE, im thinking if i can cover that range from profits ill extend to 200 and cover the increased cost just incase i get greedy or caught in a trap.

WELP, officially lost 50K in span of 2 years buying puts against TSLA, you win lads, enjoy the gains.
Pypl is legit fuckin broken lmao
bc anyone who's paying attention knows november-december is the biggest spending season of the year. We going UP
Apes use Tesla profits to buy themselves a  Tesla. Tesla quarterly report reflects more sales and deliveries. $TSLA continues to moon. Smart Apes who bought more calls make more money. Smart Apes buy 2nd Tesla . Cycle continues until all cars are Tesla and all apes are rich.
I‚Äôm holding 10k shares. Unironically
my crystal ball is kinda janky, where did you buy yours at?
FML... My 7.73 puts turned into 6.50.
my ass
Cmon LCID comeback fuk your puts
Nobody is buying more LCID, sell now and cut your losses
they took a pretty heavy hit a while ago. could just be filling the gap
Agreed. Just added a bunch of $150 calls to my already very large share holding.
God I wish I had more SBUX Puts.

Lucid is a niche luxury car that few can afford the TAM for what they sell is small and yet they are worth as much as Ford. Once the retail fomo dies down the people who bought at this price will literally never get their money back even if they execute perfectly not in 5 years not in 10 years.
Sold short the TSLA 11/5 850p for $500. I trust you to not tank papa Elon.
Mm usually let retail buy the first dip on multi week rallies. After that that‚Äôs usually when we start dumping
What is the name of the trading strategy where you buy a stock, sell it for a lower price than you bought it, buy it again at a higher price than you sold it, then sell it again for a lower price?

Normally, yes. But if there is someone else who also places a limit price as low as the price you put you may get unlucky and end up selling at the lower limit price you put despite the bid price being higher. 

Limit Orders are kind of a matchmaking system in a way if you think about it.

The next morning I had an email saying I was marked :/ and then Tesla gapped up and I was down 6k‚Ä¶ net -2k. Fml.

You'll get swept at your offer price. The brokers don't hold back your offer even if pre market bids are above your offer. It's annoying, and why you need to actively manage orders when there's gappy price action.
Someone might tell you how small the percentage of successful day traders there are.
Cannot wait to see people who bought LCID 40+
I bought more calls... ü§£
&gt; The redness of the morning is a result of lack of sleep, not an indication that it was time to sell.

Margin call or pdt violation?
I don't have any Tesla, but for those of you that do, thank you for putting the entire market on your back and carrying us this day.
you know GME is going to run someday and you don't want to miss out on that
It is. Seems so illogical that the market can still go up right now.
Holy shit, why

The buying is just relentless
Tesla touched $1,100 HAHAHAHHAHA
Broke my 25k day trading limit monday and now i just literally buy 100 SPY contracts and sell at 800-1k while im at work in about 5 minutes and hold for a bit longer since i can watch while at home.  Profits since then, 7k  for about a total hold time of less than 1 hour.  I wish someone told me about this shit years ago.
Setting a limit sell at 40 fuck disb
The short ladder
may it go down $2
yea same thought was 18 was too high. so i bought at 41 instead
I sold a handful yesterday and made a nice little chunk of change. Does that help you?
Yes, as per how the chart is moving, this seems like a good entry point for many investor to move and ride the train. Not a financial advisor, that how it seems according to how the graph is moving
Spy hit $458 twice already, this legup should break past it. Hence the IV spike on calls
MARK is parabolic today. cheap stock with cheap options.
When do I sell TSLA? I bought in around 890 and have just been holding ever since
How rich?
Guggenheim will meme
Great distinction but you're killing my gambling vibe. Downvote
Lol tsla just won‚Äôt stop.
Dude why didn‚Äôt you just get the disaster payments
Ummmm‚Ä¶..never!
Got some brand new $LCID bags today bling bling
Tesla hits ath

Lcid can't get past 38

What a fucking good day
sniped
Bought the Apple dip, supply chain issues will be solved eventually just like COVID was, don‚Äôt mind waiting
Time to Burry the Tesla hopeful.  Next Friday 980.
PLTR going to keep rising up to earnings.
So thankful I sold in the 12s üò®
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
Yeah and you can still sell your positions, they just won‚Äôt allow you to open new ones.
How in the fuck is SPY climbing
&gt; Yes, it should've sold at the limit price.
I‚Äôm out here fighting for my life rn
Anytime buddy!

Ask me how my 1080p oct 29 is doing ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
When do I sell this 11/5 1070c?
Company that makes no money is pathetic
ya think so???
naturally. i find a stock with a great run up, buy a ton of shares, and it immediately drops 30% in 30 minutes. what the fuck
Why the fuck did my APPL 155p sell at the limit price I set?  Is it not supposed to sell above that if the price is higher?
Would this be a good play: sell ICLN buy LCID sell CCs @$40 for $1600 next week?
Worried about my pypl poots
You should, I dont know...maybe do your own DD?
TD TOS news tells me "US indices are trading lower..." and SPY is mooning. Hmmm...

All-in on $ZIM
Loaded up on V calls yesterday.  So far this has proven to be a good decision
I had to sell all my margin TSLA in the 700s because of bullshit lockdowns in Australia causing financial pressure.

It was a gain, but I never wanted to sell. Feeling pretty sick watching this. Stoked for everyone else though.
And it‚Äôs a GO
TSLA you god damn cock tease
I got fukd man :c
And then 2 week out calls
BROS &gt; SBUX?
and asap! losing a fortune on qs right now
One of these days I‚Äôll actually buy into a runner after seeing it in the morning before the options go up 1000%.. swear it‚Äôs happened 3 times this week including today.
c u at 24 by EOD as per tradition....
If you followed my history at all, you know I buy SPY calls every red open.
No it isn't, TSLA is a stock and isn't sentient. It doesn't "try" anything
Those of you still in MVIS, why? What makes you want to be in this?
Y'all LCID üåàüêª are nuts buying these puts the last 2 days even on these dips, the dank premium I'm collecting is sick, y'all the drooling kind of special special
We believe in Papa Elon!
at first it was for me also, but now it's the best things that's ever happened to me.

I can literally predict what's going to happen in the market by simply inversing this sub, expecting to see loss porn the morning after

I love it
I‚Äôm so frustrated, placed an order for $28 QS calls at open when it was $26, and they werent filled. Now it‚Äôs already way above $28 üò•

It closely follows PLUG
Should I be embarrassed that I'm still trying to make SPCE happen? .. NEVER!!! I will die on this spaceship sword üó°‚öîüõ°

QS is had great earnings Q3 this week.  They‚Äôre the leader in Solid State battery technology (next generation of batteries).  Currently the only Solid State manufacturer that has a battery capable of automotive production.  They‚Äôre partnered with Volkswagen and Toyota.  Solid State is a big leap like lead acid to lithium.
start huffing fellas off for twenty bucks a pop at your local Wendy's so you can afford them
Ya such a huge overreaction. 
Still huge revenue and growth from AAPL and the only reason they missed is supply constraints - demand is thru the roof across all their product lines.
grey's anatomy apparently hired a nonbinary actor whose name is "E.R. Fightmaster" and that's fucking hilarious to me that they have that name and are in a hospital soap
RKT needs to pick a fuckin direction
Tsla trying so hard for 1100!
TSLA 1,100 just hit it - on the book as ATH
TSLA 1100 was the play after all huh fuck
Really want to short TSLA here but I know better
I keep telling you degenerates NIO üöÄ
somoene knows the short interest in tsla? I down want to google and I just want to keep drinking bear tears
Dang SBUX RSI at 25

Market on ez mode, looking at HOOD and SOFI 0 dte calls
I went 2k FB 365 11/19. For the both of us, let‚Äôs hope I‚Äôm right.
how is Tesla pumping with such low volume
Open short on Tesla at this level? ü§°
Yeah based on other comments it‚Äôs like: get your account to 25k and you can trade, but I can‚Äôt trade until that happens, or 90 days pass. I‚Äôll just wait.

Seems fitting somehow that on the two-year anniversary of CTN's GUH heard 'round the world, AAPL is down 3%.  


He wasn't wrong. Just early.
Tesla 1200 eod lets go
I. DECLARE. BANKRUPTCYYYYYYY.

Agree, but i can‚Äôt think of any news that‚Äôs going to kick up for the next 6months and people may move their money elsewhere to a more active stock short term‚Ä¶ anyway I‚Äôm wrong more than I‚Äôm right so you‚Äôre probably onto a winner
Mother fucker. I saw this play before open but fertilizer wasn't sexy enough for me. Now I'm sitting here limp dicked looking at those potential gains
Why can't we mention

Aight tesla you can go down now so I can load up on more calls
Lol it was funny when unemployment numbers were coming out in the summer of last year. Market pumping off of them regardless if they were higher or lower than expected
Yeah but you might have bought it when IV was lower compared to OP
I‚Äôve made a lot of mistakes in life, but finding this sub has been the fucking worst one
Why doesn‚Äôt  SPY EVER STOPPPPP pls just go red for a little but
The time to buy LCID was 1+ month ago in preparation for October launch. Unfortunately not in the midst of a huge run up. There I said it. Hope you didn‚Äôt get burnt too bad.
So by 3:00 today?  Thanks!
But then how will remy go to college?
Except I got my calls way too early weeks ago lol fuck
Why
Sitting on a $63 call for 11/19 I pray it strikes lol

Should I hold my $TSLA $1250c exp 12/05 over the weekend? Bought at the low this morning for $525. Figured I‚Äôd make a little quick cash on the swing but now, $1250 doesn‚Äôt seem unachievable next week.
iDRILL
Can you fucks buy lucid so my calls go up please
Now that Lucids losing its legs other EV puts, especially puts on piece-of-shit failed prototype USPS contract-losing under $1b marketcap EV companies that had EV hype runoff for literally no fucking reason, should start printing
If spy doesn‚Äôt stay red today I will officially give up and close my trading account
Fuk outta here with that
But NVDA is still a money printer.   Can't Stop wont stop NVDA.
Base on the chart, it seems very bullish
All of the fundamentalists and value investors are saying it's time to get in on INTC, but like ... they've been such an awful company. IDK if I trust this one!
Where are the LCID bag holders now
thank you so much for expanding, makes sense now :)  is there any possible way this ends liberals or only fair elections can stop this mayhem? I am surprised your country has so many liberal and left media channels, but not so many right wing.

SPY 460 EOD.
So I opened a margin account with E*Trade just to allow me to trade with unsettled funds (it was making me wait till they settled lol). 

Never used the margin ‚Äúfunds‚Äù my trades always used my actual cash. 

Anyways I accidentally was marked as a pattern day trader when I had like $22k in the account. E*trade says I have a ‚Äúmargin call‚Äù; gotta add the funds to get me to 25k. 

Question: is this exclusively so that I can remove the day trader block on my account for trading, or do I owe E*trade some money somehow?
SPY 460 today gonna make me RICH
Who's buying the SBUX dip? Never go against the might of McKenzie's and their white girl power.

Rally off 457 again. Damn.
holding a leveraged etf for more than a day or two rarely works out. The math of it all makes it less efficient than just holding the underlying usually. That being said I held a few for 2 weeks before (NAIL and ROM) and got really luck with some fantastic returns but most of the time I would get like 30% gains in 4 days and then lose them all plus some more on day 5.

Biden is just a puppet. The problem is that our country is being run by an entity that controls the rest of the world. 

They created a mandate for the vaccine which they know the majority of Americans (trump supporters) don‚Äôt want. Which is the reason why there are so many available jobs right now. Unvaccinated are losing their jobs or are being prevented from working. 

This works in their (liberals) favor because now no one is working, which has created a supply chain issue, which we all know about.
This now justifies continued stimulus packages &amp; provides fodder to attack capitalism because ‚Äúcapitalism can‚Äôt keep up with supply and demand‚Äù. Their end game is a communist style economy in America.

This whole issue alone proves that trump won the election. Trump supporters, as a whole, would rather work than live off the government; however, as we can see, they‚Äôre being prevented from working which is why we are in the situation that we are in now; however, let‚Äôs not forget the other issue - Biden and company, have allowed China to keep manufacturing, as a whole, which Trump was bringing back to America. 

Funny how fast we‚Äôve sunk into this shit pile after Biden was ‚Äúelected‚Äù.

AMZN and AAPL down 4 percent each, after a horrible earnings miss.  Yeesh.    Looks like they truly are, too big to fail.
That's a good strat with those bubble stocks

this new version of the stock market is crazy!

sold my 457.5 calls rolling into 458
NVDA is going to 260 today if the overall market comes back. AAPL confirming lasting chip shortage in their earnings call last night is so bullish for semis. My conviction is strongest in this one.
Dont stop the rock
Is there even anyone in here talking about FSR? All I see is TSLA and LCID.
I think SPY 0DTE strangles are the play
I had 2000 JNUG shares last year right after the reverse split. Paper handed them on that run up to 180ish. Gold has no momentum but I still like to have at least I little bit of exposure.

The minute you're trying to convince this thread to stop selling or complaining about paper hands is the minute you know it's over.
Leaps sound good but AAPL has this huge 150 price hurdle it keeps getting bogged down by. Still worth getting some you think?
Yes.
I told in two or more detailed comments why the options open interest is going to destroy them and that all TSLA has to do for those to be triggered is to hold, got massively downvoted. Bers love to be creampied.

/u/Codicus1212 (0/1) made a bet that AMD would go to 140.0 when it was 123.1 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

I can't tell if It is the greatest bull trap of the year  or spy is going to 460.
Which one of you bought my 7DTE LCID 55C?
Lucid dreams of me actually making money...
[deleted]
[deleted]
SPY clearly
will FB  hit 1T market cap today?
You can officially call me a $REEtard.

Bullish af, MOON RIDE SOON
‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait for the SPY dip before buying this morning‚Äù :(
Where else can money go?
no red won't last. november is the best month of the year for spy, this dip is gonna get bought reaaaaallly quick
Well they do fucking everything. Solar, plastics, natural gas etc. have tons of patents. Own shit tons of land. Exxon is straight up old money. 

Go back to February of this year and the CEO basically said ‚Äúthanks for cheap shares bitches I‚Äôm buying this mf dip‚Äù
Blaming the previous administration for the border crisis which is not actually a crisis now that the libtards are in power, classic. Who built the cages Joe?üòÇ
My LCID 42s are about to be ITM
META IS BOOMING LOVE U ZUCK
I want you guys to make it.  AMZN 3350 0DTE is the way. Up 17% in 5 minutes
Who is pumping Lucid I wonder. The company makes no profits no revenue and makes very low quantity production. 

Will take many years for it to be even remotely competitive. Clearly a pump and dump
Can't buy what stores don't have, retard.
LCID not only crossed $40 but raced to $41 üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
[deleted]
9:45 it‚Äôs going to dump harder
all depends if it can hold around 39-40 for the morning rush I can see it easily going to 45-48 by midday not sure if it will stay that high for the whole day tho
Hopefully
Why?
Just bought 50x Spy 457$C.  

Just sold 50x Spy 457$C.  

Ez Money
Why will it pop?
FB $330C 0DTE ez money
Smell that bulltrap in the air?
rednecks apparently

the usual suspects
My dick has lebesgue measure zero right now
aaaaand not even close to 1M SPY shares in that candle
Daily reminder, RKT is a piece of shit! That is all.
Palantards eating today too
There‚Äôs the morning pump. Loading on SPY puts now
I was more referring to all their legacy internal combustion products and factories, all their pension obligations etc. These new EV companies are starting clean.
Blowin‚Äô on that endo. 
GameCube. Nintendo. 
5% Tint so y‚Äôall can‚Äôt see up in my window.

Holy fk X I can only cooooom so much in the first 10 minutes of market open
In the time it took me to take a shit lucids up 3 bucks fucking insanity
Depends on how big his port was at the start

$X U.S. steel hitting ATH today I‚Äôm calling it right now
60
I'm a bull and the retardedness of this almost makes me kind of angry
Wow the AAPL and AMZN fallout isn't hitting my portfolio as hard as I imagined. In fact, very few of my positions are red. Will it last?!
&gt; Yes.
LCID to 60
I don't think its necessarily a scam. But the market is absolutely telling you something. Its telling you that since April, the market believes the stock is overvalued, and has been crashing. My best guess would be the stock settles back down around the $5 range.

You can hold in the hopes that it will come back, but you bought close to its peak, and there doesn't seem to be any inclination it will come back.

Is CVX gonna keep going? Earnings was good but they barely moved.

AMZN FDs GOGOGOGO

CHPT and China Tesla need love long time

40 broken, 60 here we fucking come
Pltr looks delicious damn
When you‚Äôve been collecting lots of shares below $10 for a while, you notice 10c.
Fuck you cavenders is overpriced and caters to highland park cowboys.
All $TSLA has to do today is to hold for a few hours and those huge open interests in the $1000+ strikes will rape the ghey bers.
Yes
Both
Where do you see lcid at today?
i made a killing on it almost exactly a year ago

then i also got fucking burned by it a few months later

fun stock
11/5 34p on lcid
was 40 the highest strike for lcid weeklies as of yesterday? looking like some thicc resistance getting plunged as i type this
Over 6,000 shares. I‚Äôm in the green. Holding through 2023. 

BB will be huge in the long run
STRONG HOLD
Depends on how big a base you have, smooth-brain!

Boot barn fucking blows. Cavender‚Äôs is 100x better.
If you are not buying calls then what are you doing?
Banbet it. You won‚Äôt
does putting in ridiculously low orders on the day of earnings  actually work? I saw some AAPL calls go down all the way to 0.2 but the lowest of the day says 0.05 . is it worth trying in the future?
LC making me so hard this morning
Bought Nov 5th 457c
My aneurism popped from reading that
Cant wait to dump those bags
$X US STEEL HITTING $30 today I‚Äôm calling it, hell yeah big mover babyyyyyyy

What looks better puts on DWAC or calls on SNAP?
I miss Steve. He would of never let this happen.
I meta bought lucid or I meta not.
No one wants your traah
people talking about this potential 450k to the victims of the border crisis as if it isn't a settlement for lawsuits stemming from the previous administration's policies
I'm sure selling amazon a month before the holidays is a great play.
Bees only fly up
Damn, finally got a good position on SPY, thanks for the dip AMZN and AAPL!
XOM buying back shares....how this thing still yields so much is a mystery
LMAOOO
LCID LETS GOOOOOO

The prophecy!
Come on you beautiful bird, get up there!

Always bull for the long term.  Taking puts a year out is basically trying to predict a market crash
Moneybag YO is fuckin' lame-o
Should I start a position in X today ü§î
After those earnings I‚Äôm in on FB shit will pop no lie
Up 10 cents lol
I didn't say it measures volatility, I said it measures IV, which is something in Black-Scholes.

The fed doesn't purchase stocks. It can only purchase bonds and ETFs of bonds. People in the fed can purchase stocks, but Congress hasn't given the fed itself that power.

Time will tell what tapering does, but theoretically it should increase yields. The fed has bought far more than they've sold over this period.
[deleted]
Reference?
People really gonna fall for this lucid pump and dump again huh
Not any longer
dumped my AMZN shares at open.  don't wanna mess with this one right now.  only lost like $180

Excuse me mr market I was hoping to make some money today
$PROG ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
DOWN WITH TSLA , gamma melt downwards
And to further rebuttal Fed had to alter Bonds because of the increased rate in Interest, when Banks where buying repos for liquidity and then paying points back, they eventually raised interest rates to recoup ‚Äútheir‚Äù loss.

Fed didn‚Äôt like them extending their loss to us, because we complained, and so they did RRP/threatened tapering.

So now the RRP pay back banks at a lower %, but they are still buying bonds/securities and when tapering stops they can just sell them back to Fund issues.
wait for AMZN to level out and then get some 3300 or 3350 FDs for a quick flip

Americans can you explain? Why did Biden the day before just said economy is at peak levels and everyone is spending a ton and that you should be celebrating? Isn't he the root cause of inflation and supply chain issues? Or did I miss a part and he was good to celebrate..? (Think it was when he was pushing a candidate for election for state or something 2 days ago)
Missed out on some AAPL gains yesterday, but about to flip these SPY puts real quick
Wasn‚Äôt there someone posting on here with like $1m in MVIS stock? Wonder how that‚Äôs going and if they cashed out?

Why on a Friday night?
JPowell should dress up as the grim reaper and say the fed is gonna start tapering.
They raised their dividend and it will be talked about a lot on CNBC. Boomer hype
To say VIX measures volatility can also be considered ‚Äúwrong‚Äù when you look at the underlying formula for it. Which is the BSM. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp

It even says, that using this equation skews results towards a volatile pattern. 

And Tapering isn‚Äôt bad/nor good, because the Fed will be slowing its purchasing of ‚Äúsecurities‚Äù which are Stocks or Bonds. Which you say, raises the rates because they purchase new ones.

I agree, but it lowered interest rates when they stopped the repos. So they needed to buy new ones as an Emergency. But if you look they sold a lot of Old Bond‚Äôs/Securities throughout this time to banks/institutions for liquidity to pay for debt and do things like lowering the rates. This tapering isn‚Äôt going to really effect any of us in the way that we think it is.

You have no idea what driver's cars Mazda makes.  Of the 'big brands' it's by far the best unless stepping up to BMW/LEXUS, etc. but it's not very far behind them.  Go drive one.
Until they can make VR/AR as easy to use as putting on a normal pair of glasses, it‚Äôs not happening. Have you tried using a VR headset lately? Even the better and more comfortable ones are a fucking pain in the ass, and I say that as a VR enthusiast who owns two separate headsets.

Lcid to 50 is laughable.  You fucka have better chance of getting gme to 200
next week's 40c at the open for a quick run. I think it overshoots $40, probably hits $41-$42. The increase in open interest itself should increase these 40c enough for a nice gain.

LCID DREAMZ TODAY
On Tuesday me and my friend talking bout lucid will be future tesla. That njght i was listening to lucid dream song. Wednesday morning i saw the news about first delivery and saudi deals. Option chains otm was cheap 0.04-0.05 for 35c. Its like all the sign to tell me to go for it. But i paperhanded and sold all my x100 35c for 5500, which now is at 38k. Now i am crying like a baby
sorry about those puts
Bring phone with you problem solved
Trade on the shitter like the rest of us
Just trade on the toilet mate
Last year vs this year
Write an entire person off for one bad fill on ONE share bought for fun?  My returns for the year are 380%.  I stashed the 300% gain in March in a safe account and since then only YOLO trade now with the original principle.  I‚Äôm down 20% on that portion for the rest of the year.  People on here lose way way way more money than I do, they just don‚Äôt have the flair

yeah see this sort of reference is what i'm talking about. no understanding of industrial organization or supply chain management or even money velocity. There is absolutely *zero* evidence that fed stimulus is what's behind inflation and it's been proven for over a decade that money printing doesn't necessarily lead to inflation. your masters must not be in economics
And of course the dip is being bought right before market open. Fucking hate this.

I have a Master's and the Fed's stimies are causing inflation.  They encourage spending and not working, which forces companies to raise prices per the Supply Demand equation that is taught in Econ 101

Despite the FED coming to the unfortunate conclusion that all these trillions they've printed has lead to more inflation than expected, don't worry!
  
Yellen says these next couple trillion definitely won't do that, and through some financial miracle, the additional money will actually be anti-inflationary!  Wow! We really do have the best, folks.

VIX isn't a put-to-call ratio indicator, it's an indicator of the IV of SPY options 30 days out (both calls and puts).

Tapering would raise bond yields because the fed is currently buying up all the new bonds, which raises the market value of bonds that remain on the market and thus lowers their yield. When the fed stops buying fuckloads of bonds, their yields will be higher.

R/relationship advice is the best fucking place on the whole internet. I am literally crying laughing right now. 

My girlfriend (20F) caught me (18M) doing something disgusting and she now thinks I'm a pervert

We have a great relationship personally except our workloads- she works full time and I work part time and am a full time student, I also play sports quite seriously at college so that takes up alot. I've never dated before her although she has, and I naturally have a much higher libido than her (she probably turns me down 80-90% of the time I try and initiate sex, even if its just making out or me going down on her). We haven't had sex for a week because of work and stuff and I'm usually someone who would ejaculate several times a day (I have super high testosterone because of a medical condition). Neither of us watch porn or anything like that. I had a very sheltered upbringing so I haven't really had an education about what's normal sexually, not that I'm excusing my behavior.

Last night she was in the bathroom showering and i was in our bedroom having just been rejected from sex again. Because she'd got undressed in the bedroom a pair or her panties were on the bed. Idk why this is but I really like it when a girl takes charge in the bedroom, so one of my favorite things to do sexually is for her to sit on my face (we've only done this twice and I basically had to beg). So I picked them up and smelled them (idk why, I was insanely horny) and it smelt of her scent and I basically lost control and started jerking off imagining it was her. About 30 seconds later my girlfriend walked in and saw me masturbating while sniffing her underwear and sitting on the bed. 

She went mad, and yelled that I'm a pervert and disgusting and lots of other stuff. I obviously apologized loads because I was in the wrong but she was still mad that I was jerking off when I'm in a relationship and using her underwear to top it off. I honestly hadn't felt that embarrassed since I was a kid, and I went to sleep downstairs to let her cool off. I tried cuddling her first but she yelled at me to go away and said I'm a freak, which I guess is true but still made me cry slightly. I just feel like total shit and a horrible person, I've probably lost a relationship with the girl I want to marry, and whats worse I always thought of myself as a gentleman who'd never do the horrible things we read about men doing on the news but now I've done something horrible as well.

Is there anything I can do to salvage this situation? Obviously I can't to talk to anyone irl about it so strangers on the internet is the only solution. It's just gone 3AM now and I still cant sleep, I sort of feel shaky and anxious like I haven't since I was little.

If they sell off in the 7% to 10% range then they are going to drag the broader retail sectors with them.  A 3% selloff isn't out of the realm of possibility as the street digests the impact of the costs of inflation and supply chain bottlenecks on future earnings.

In that case, probably stuck with the SPAC label. If it's still new to the market, price swings are only natural. Most IPOs drop below entry price and go quiet for a while until institutional investors understand them, then you see a rise. Usually this takes between 6 to 18 months to happen.

I mean, there is zero evidence that your hypothesis is true. People aren't working because they don't want to. They aren't working because they are ground down by a system that takes everything from them and gives nothing back. The shortages are a natural result of a private sector to heavily focused on Just in time deliveries, which only works when you've got cheap foreign labor and no meaningful disruptions. 

And finally, we've seen American saving rates actually increase, not decrease, as a result of the stimulus checks. Believe it or not, your fellow Americans are capable of long term planning.

So your thesis is bullshit, and you should feel bad.

ABBV premarket got me feeling some sort of way
Did you drop acid or something? What's wild about clubbing?
Her and Kate Beckinsale were bringing the fucking HEAT in the early 2000s. Underrated horror movie too.
Keep holding brother, you wont regret.
It is not always a fallacy though. That's the issue. Income tax started with just the super wealth and look where we are at now. Never underestimate the ability of the government to overreach with tax policy.

No I just know a guy. Literally my subordinate. He played GME well earlier this year and rolled 25% of that into LCID. Dude is about to quit and start his own cybersecurity company and he offered me a position in the company if he makes it work.

That movie terrified 10 year old me
Will the market allow me two green days in a row or do I just assume all of yesterday's gains will be erased at opening?
Exactly look at Nutrien. Solid company, strong growth and earnings due out on Nov 1st. Then everyone will act surprised when they have another blowout quarter.
Lmao
Pinky: What do you plan to do today Brain?
Titerras, F it we'll see what happens.
People still sleeping on steel. CLF earnings massive beat. X earnings massive beat. Tech bad guidance. Chip shortage. Supply shortage. 

Super cycle incoming. Can‚Äôt wait.

Greed my friend, greed. Figured there was a small chance of a bloody Thursday to be life changing money, or atleast maybe a flat kind of day to take profit then‚Ä¶. But nope, just mooned all day long
Not only that but the 700,000 dead workers? Or pandemic?

I mean you can‚Äôt not factor in those things. As well as other issues.
I was up to my tits in Live Nation and Marriot puts. Didn't even feel right.
Cool story bro, now wtf are your positions?
A true realist. I am short GME and it will make me rich
Same predicament here
Just what did you think would happen betting against a company aiming for trillions in revenues?
Then pick a bone‚Ä¶
Time to dump shares + leaps?
Welp classic case of I should have sold before earnings
Oh you know a guy who knows a guy who made money

RC needs to get his shit together. This whole secretive bs is only gonna tank the stock further. 

Step in front of a camera and speak you cuck!
I feel like a dog today
Pretty much. But like I said every stock was dropping like flies. Options were relatively cheap on Banks though so I bought puts and bought puts on SPY.
Nothing you ever say will be useful with a flair like that
Your position was worth more than the median US household yearly income and you didn't think selling was a good option??
No it ain‚Äôt -.-
Fuck you better.
You didn't sell 80k worth of puts at the end of Wednesday? Oh boy...
ICLN leaps back in play?

This is my thinking on Apple also. So I‚Äôm thinking SPY calls 0DTE at open.

Solar and EV companies. That‚Äôs the play. Thank me later

Trust me brother, they have a direction.

Purdue university admitted way too many students and had to rent properties from local landlords at college housing rates. Some lucky jackasses making stupid money.
I was wondering if this price is a good starting point to get in. I think I‚Äôm gonna wait for it to grind down a bit more.
20 30cs

Every dollar increase is 2k at least, maybe more cause iv is so insane on these calls rn
Gotcha. So you saw a potential run on banks or failing loans as a result of the bankruptcy.
Who would have thought printing money leads to no one working, shortages, high prices, and doesn‚Äôt increase economic output? ü§°. It‚Äôs like cheating on your SATS, getting into College, and wondering why you‚Äôre still not smart
 900 of the 350M people in the US would be affected.
I see Lucy is tee'ing up that US Steel Football for Charlie Brown again.
Those people are screwed as soon as January rolls around and he starts voting left and right to dump more shares into the pool.
üêª Pray &amp; use indicators like VIX or 10yr, but can‚Äôt give you an explanation of what a repo/rrp does or why tapering wouldn‚Äôt effect the market.

Vix is only an indicator of put to call ratio over a 30-40 day period(forget time frame). It‚Äôs not actually ‚Äúfear‚Äù.

And tapering would in fact be bond yields lowering, which we are seeing. Because the Fed isn‚Äôt selling as much Securities‚Ä¶..
I'm 30 living by myself and you'd chop off your left nut to get my girlfriend to even look in your direction but ok bubs
Sell my Amazon puts this morning. Buy spy calls at open. That‚Äôs the play
with sir jacks 6 million he could buy over 1800 shares of AMZN. the 11/5 3660c are just over 2000 per call. thats 36000 a week, or 1,872,000 a year. if the covered calls expired worthless 80% of the time that's still 1.5m a year.
Limit down? Huh
Wait, the dollar is rallying? I thought it had finally started to decline last week?

Speaking of, you noticed just how well gold and silver stocks have been doing this last month? Strange.
Nothing in sync this market. It‚Äôs Teflon.
It stings even more if you waited more than 30min in line..
Bro I‚Äôm holding that shit just to remind myself not to listen to people like you.
Well airlines and entertainment industry were the first to go, but then people started dumping bank stocks because another 2008 scenario occurring. The fed cleared that up in March saying they were putting in protective measures for banks and stabilized the industry. 

Everything was falling at that point though.
Macro data coming out today looked bad.  Not that this market gives a shit.
Boomer dow said he don‚Äôt wanna go down
I've got a touch of FOMO too now. I was as bullish on them as possible pre DA and am considering buying one of their cars when the dealership down the road from me opens. Their proposed pipe volumes are way too high. We must stick together on the not fomo-ing bandwagon.
Shout out to wsb helping (even if terribly) people learn how to invest over the last few years

I hope GME drops to where it belongs, as an unprofitable company with no strategy and miserable investor relations, having a 8min earnings call last time with literally not a single word regarding future plans
Imagine owning a apartment complex near Rutgers university. Makin bank
*schmuck. FTFY.
Had $30k of 10/29 $455p‚Äôs for 80 cents that were worth $80k after Wednesdays drop and $15k after yesterday. Fuckin don‚Äôt know if I should offload them for a loss right at opening or not.
It‚Äôs fairly valued if the Fed continues printing billions a month
aren't they overpriced as shit right now with the supply issues?
It's Friday on wallstreetbets, if you don't have calls expiring today get the fuck out
Hold out
You got to get out man. They are never coming back. It's Nikola all over again
Only if you turn your phone upside down
Lemme tell you about my little shame bags  if that makes you feel better got into CRSR at 45.31 .

I'm 30% terrible play that might be a 10 bagger depending on geopolitics, 40% cash, and 30% "when the fuck did I buy these fucking options and why?!"
I spent the last 8 hours watching Youtube videos on gamma squeeze. Locking and loading puts this AM. Come Xmas it‚Äôll be a Wendy‚Äôs dumpster or one of Elon‚Äôs mansions for me.
People have to sell all the time because they can't afford the taxes. Imagine if that happened to securities. It wouldn't just affect the buyer.
I know that feeling and it fucking sucks.

Looks like I‚Äôm waiting another 3 months for an AAPL catalyst
Looking at new Toyota Tundras but those gas prices having me thinking twice. Might just hold out for the Ford lightning.
Yup. Then straight to 1250
GME is legit, amc is only being held up because it was basket shorted in total return swaps with gme.

Hedge funds got wrekt on that basket short, amc diluted 1to4 during January, hedge funds escaped and switched to long AMC.

AMC is their GME hedge. 

Everyone thinks they are concurrent plays but they are not. GME is the only play

shhh , the puts i've been selling are literally paying my monthly rent. I need them to keep belivin.
There‚Äôs millionaires

Then there‚Äôs 50M and above

Then there‚Äôs 500M and above

Then there‚Äôs billionaires 

The differences between all of these in terms of lifestyles and money considerations is actually huge

Below 50M and you can‚Äôt fly private

Go get a thermometer for the pot. I need this shit cooked right.
FOMO calls that are about to be worthless i think
It feels like that time I bought CLNE at $13.
MVIS is the biggest POS stock I have ever bought. I am ashamed my average is $17.03

As of their shitty earnings call it is now $7.31 premarket this morning. 

These bags are heavy.
It‚Äôs up 30% in like a month.

Sdc is the shitties stock ever. Has it even went about 6 yet?
Lmao what. This is exactly the propaganda that gets people, if you think you're being serious.

The billionaires and high 8 figure and 9 figure people are on another fucking plane even from ordinary "millionaires," nevermind people who can be lumped into a "class" other than "super fucking rich."

Linking unrealized gains taxes in the millions to "you're next" is completely fucking ludicrous, "politics" aside and just focusing on the monetary value and ROI such a policy would have. Unbelievable

Thats another shit stock thats has trouble getting up. Don't listen to this man
Yeah, but where's the hype? This market is operating on hype and speculation. If X doesn't have memes posted about it here on WSB, and people yelling about it St the top of their lungs on Tik Tok, does anyone care?

This guy is lying and probably has calls that will expire
Last chance to get cheap calls and shares on SoFi before IV and stock price bust higher all next week. I think we go into earnings at ~$22

Edit: loving the hate on SoFi, making me even more bullish! You will chase at $25+
This is the end of earnings week optimism/volume not taper worries that‚Äôs in a few weeks

I understand that Safari uses Google, no kidding.
LCID is gonna keep running just because you fuckers haven't capitulated to the insanity yet.
So my new theory on GME and AMC is the prices are being held up to these ludicrous valuations until most of the January investors who got in at less than 40 or so can sell for cap gains instead of short term gains.

Edit: oh no apes are downvoting me.
He says that the spending report should be higher because inflation means the amount of money to buy goods goes up. Since it only rose .6% that means most likely people are only buying what they have to and not extra goods like, video games, tvs, stuff like that
well you could always schmear it yourself amiright
Mvis!? Are you stupid? That's a shitty company that cant get it up
Hellen is trying to pump the new spending bills saying they won‚Äôt be inflationary. Something tells me she‚Äôs lying.

Dudes are paying effective tax rates of 4%. Either fix the system so they have to pay an equal share with the rest of us, or billionaire tax the loop holers.     But claiming this is some sort of unfair crap, when they pay so little so that everyone else has to pay more is stupid.
Yeah I agree. I think we‚Äôre set till end of Q1 of 22‚Äô. I‚Äôm pretty sure OPEC themselves will start dumping more barrels around then


Im glad EVs are bullish now!

Haha some are starting to wake up to EO Charging.

Hardly a drop. Their AWS numbers were great.

Inflation is transitory. Personal spending is not. Market is going to tank so hard because of that. Less spending=less profits. Hope you take your profits today.
Just thinking about the ad bucks they can get from their own search engine. Seems logical.
Can't argue with that..
Pretty sure half the sub got banned on TSLA calls/ puts this week

Massive selloff primed for today before close. Boomers don't understand that the November taper means later in November, not just in general, and Monday = November.
This will probabaly be 99% of the content.
What are the numbers looking like
77 billion in revenue, just makes you think about how big XOM is, and how oil is still liquid gold.
That's gonna be a no from me dawg. This is the pump playground my guy

Damn amd is drunk or wat?
Consumer spending up .6% in the midst of inflation which drives up consumer spending reports.

Was debating on whether to elaborate.

It‚Äôs bad. It means that even with increased prices which means people HAVE to spend more, consumer spending only rose .6%. Which means people are only buying what they have to probably. Am stupid too
Always SBUX AAPL and TGT

Yeah i dont get it. Do people even play VR games?
amzn should have dumped way more, it's "only" 4% down for some reason

Wages down, prices up, Chicago Businesses goin broke, folks in Michigan are not happy, BAM! All the news for today.

Not an argument. I ain't saying it's right or wrong. Just reminding y'all bout the clown market we're in.

VisualMod what is your favorite stock over the next 5 years?
Lucid had a major pump and dump last feb. do you really think those people that bought at $58 isn‚Äôt going to see this as an opportunity to sell of their bags? That‚Äôs the way I look at this, anytning it pumps, it will dump. Too many bag holders for too long on that stock to keep it up.

1% is embarrassing and insulting
What is everyone‚Äôs thoughts on the crazy volume for $1000 calls on Tesla? Apparently half of all options bought was in Tesla.
While I do agree, man said they haven't "sold" a car yet. They have, it just hasn't been delivered (to the U.S., Saudi has had deliveries).
&gt; I'd be back in the game within 6 months.
Nucor weeklies
Day trades are within the same trading day. If you bought yesterday and sell today you're in the clear. Ticker name does not matter, the stock is still the same.
How long would it take you to relearn how to trade if you went blind?
Google pelase
FB has a vision and they are going to be at the frontline.
Historically when Tesla rips greater than 15% it does so on back to back days 70% of the time. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk of why Lucid is going to make us all rich today.
well, you win?
I thought that killed stocks
I love those days where everything is cheap
If you put in 10k a year now, an extra 10k a year in a index fund giving you 6-8% a year will let you retire 10 years earlier. If you can beat a boring index, then it only gets better.

Be responsible for your own profile bro. It‚Äôs a casino.
Oh no. I‚Äôm offended. That was not funny or very nice. Loser.
What‚Äôs the move today boys?
Most of us jumped on in Feb for a buyout play. It didn't materialize and the company announced it was going to go solo and dropped a $140M ATM in Jun. From there, it was a slow bleed through yesterday. Welp, they indicated yesterday that timelines for actual orders are pushed to around next June. So no actual sales expected until then for a $1B market cap w current quarterly sales of $700k.   
Still bullish for long term play, but this is not what we signed up for.

DWAC back to $55
Well, technically first pickup is tomorrow. 

Long term I'm not convinced of their survivability. Their first challenge will be establishing some kind of dealer network. Next, they will need to establish service centers, as well as certify technicians to work on these vehicles.

With their only cars being more than $140,000 new, their market space is tiny, and we have no idea of their ramp up capability. We know from Musk that Tesla came to the verge of bankruptcy several times. Lucid has a good start, but it is still burning over a billion a year. That cash flow is going to have to be made up somehow.

TSLA will need to be the lead battery producer, auto manufacturer and solar panel manufacturer in the world with a comfortable lead over their competitors  to even be close to what they are valued at right now.

In other words they would need 25-50% of sale in each of these categories or their markets to expand drastically.

*Amazon stock price target raised to $4,350 from $4,100 at J.P. Morgan* \- Buy the dip!
I feel like you just ignored my other comment so let me just reiterate the only point you could actually run with to practice your critical thinking.

India has reported about half a million covid deaths. Given the nature of the covid surge they faced previously, you'd think there was no way to stop the virus from spreading throughout the population and probably infecting the majority of people, and given the death rate of the virus, you'd expect up to around 10 million deaths, or still be in the plural millions if you low ball it.

How do you explain the discrepancy? How did India limit deaths to around half a million? If the virus infected at least half of the population, do you realize how low the death rate would have to be for half a million total deaths? Is the death rate actually that low? Is it usually higher but that low for Indian people? Why would that be? Did they somehow prevent the virus from reaching at least half their population with the previous surge? How could that have been done? 

There are possible answers to all of these questions. Maybe even plausible answers. I'm not saying I can't be wrong and your position is impossible. But here's the more important point. 

Why consider the matter of likelihood when you're a living being and this is ultimately a matter of life and death? Even if plausible, every answer that leads to half a million is uncertain, unproven - baseless at best, and a stretch in suspension of disbelief at worst. Occam's razor would tell you it's probably just that people with a vested interest in not letting huge numbers destroy the economy decided to lie about the numbers. And a simple sense of self-preservation would tell you to ignore the "probably" part - if the virus has a much lower death rate for Indians than you'd expect and Occam's razor is leading you to the wrong conclusion, you lose nothing, you simply have to wait until more scientific information comes out to find out there's less danger than you perceived possible. If the virus killed far more Indians than they claim, and you ignore Occam's razor and assume the governments of the world have things under control and they aren't trying to cover up the deaths of people like you for the sake of their economy, but you're wrong - you might fucking die as the cost of being wrong, and the reason you were wrong in the first place was a dumbass desire to believe the best case scenario when all logic would have told you that without evidence of safety, danger is the more logical assumption. 

Think about it. Can you understand how "the estimates are likely depressed" is a pretty retarded brainwashed thing to say about numbers that you have no reason to believe have any legitimacy at all? Wouldn't it be better to just assume the numbers have nothing to do with reality since you have no evidence they do and nothing to gain from considering them?

Trusting the official estimates *at all* is just a cop out for people too intellectually lazy to estimate their own perceived range of possibilities.

Instagram is still the go to for social media. WhatsApp though not social media is the golden standard internationally. At this point they just have so much money for expansion and buying out smaller competitors. It‚Äôs going to be hard to remove their stranglehold on the industry

Because stocks move the most on what forward expectations are, not the current quarter.

Guidance and what analysts/markets expect forward quarters to look like are way more important than the current earnings.  How the earnings announcement/guidance affect the next 4-6 quarters is basically what you're looking at...

Current earnings do not carry all that significant a weight unless it's a massive miss or beat that sets up to carry forward into future quarters.

I decided 2 years ago to clean up my Digital Life, delete all the accounts I never used anymore, change all my passwords for everything, and most importantly delete all my social media accounts including Facebook. Reddit was the only one I left. I have not regretted that decision a single time in the last two years and Facebook's decisions just reinforce how much I don't need an account on their.  Hopefully people make money off of them but in the long run I feel they're going to fall the way of Myspace and Vine and all the others and be replaced by something newer and better and possibly less evil

The estimates aren't "likely depressed," they're just fake numbers meant to keep the status quo going. There's zero chance of the reality being closer to 5 million than 50 million. How do you explain India's numbers within your theory of there being a chance the estimates are legitimate? 

I'm definitely not interested in listening to multiple episodes of a well known propaganda podcast. I would highly recommend practicing critical thinking more to make yourself less susceptible to propaganda if you'd even recommend that at all. Thinking about these covid numbers would be a great starter project to practice on. The purpose of me saying this isn't how condescending it sounds, I'm actually being sincere, the condescension is an unintended side effect

APPLE used Intel processors to put into their product. Then created their own.

Well on this very day in 1929 fuckers threw themselves out of skyscrapers, and the Great Depression insured and then grapes of wrath came upon us
Some people have been asking that question since 3 months ago „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
One day? Most companies are decreasing their outlook for q4‚Ä¶.
3 months ago was the time to get into commodities. Actually Feb/March was a really good dip for things like steel. We're on the tail end of the current dip and pulling out of it.
Fidelity is sorta doing that with their Beta.
&gt;n be done but then do nothing about it?

yup that one .. lol
üéµI have these lucid dreams where i don‚Äôt feel a thing üéµ
Are you serious? GDP growth was estimated to be 7% percent for this quarter. It was 2%. Big companies are giving lower expectations on q4. The price of everything is through the roof. You can‚Äôt even order shit without it taking forever to get. 
We are in for some pain
Tried to talk some sense into the folks over at DWAC sub. Don‚Äôt know why I bothered. They legitimately think it‚Äôs going to hit 5,000 like next week. Laughed at me for getting in at 14 and selling at 110
I really feel like we can be patient with AAPL and AMZN.  Their Christmas quarter is likely to face the same problems and maybe even Q1.

After that, the inflationary/supply chain problems should start subsiding and we could get some upside surprises as their margins come back.
Why doesn‚Äôt Webull fidelity etc just copy robinhood‚Äôs design? Would literally murder robinhood user count
I‚Äôm betting everything that we‚Äôre back to the spy only goes up times no matter what lol
you beautiful bastard don‚Äôt make me double down
Ooof that was a bad idea
A pullback is coming, might be a 10% correction.

Then we're cleared to 4600 and beyond.
But 'expected' sales go down because of the chip shortage too. When you have low expectations, they are easier to beat.
Not a nice pussy either. That shits blown out

They just put PR out on Wednesday I think. Also had a ton of analyst PT raises from the symposium. It is give back gains friday though so I expect deep red today.
I mean, that's kind of big brain
Market the past couple weeks is basically telling us that the play is to focus on the stuff that's working right now: low retail/shipping/hardware/employee count/labor cost footprint kind of companies.

In 6 to 9 months, that will change and the rotation will be back into the companies that are high retail/shipping/hardware/employee count/labor cost footprint as they get margin expansion and start crushing earnings results.

Basically, Nancy Pelosi and the rest will load up on AAPL/AMZN/etc. leaps in 5 or 6 months.

Short term, I think easiest way to play it is to play the rotation to small caps; I've been loading IWM calls a few months out and expect them to break out cleanly at some point.
Would you like some help with your mental health so you can try to stop perceiving sane people as batshit crazy? I'd be happy to discuss the matter with you if you're not gonna be a disingenuous troll prick the whole time
Considering the earnings, AAPL is holding up surprisingly well.  Was planning to buy in on the dip but the stock is only at the levels of about 10 days ago.  Will have to watch the price action after the open when the volume picks up.

so $PLUG is moving because of the Climate Change conference ? there doesnt seem to be any other catalyst.
I'm sure we're already past 50 million deaths from covid anyway. I don't care about the vaccines that are currently available, they're not really worth discussing. The question to me is just, how much of the future is safe from the virus? How much more complicated will it make the creation of utopia? Is it going to be extinct in a few years, or will intelligent portions of the globe adapt to quarantine it away while more retarded populations keep incubating it? Will we get a proper vaccine any time soon, and if so will it be distributed globally in an effective way? Is it going to dominate the whole planet but at least be successfully kept off Mars, leading Mars to be the place for smart people? Is it just going to spread everywhere humans go and fuck up humanity forever? These are the questions that actually matter in the long run, not how many of today's people are going to die, considering we're still in the era where everyone was dying anyway.
What do you need the apple watch for if you ve got a phone?
You might get a shitload of Karma if you post the loss porn ü§ëü§ëü§ë
Yes, earnings for most big tech companies are almost always breaking records every quarter. The question is if they beat estimates, which AAPL did not on revenue. That and/or bad guidance will cause stocks to drop no matter how 'record-setting' a quarter is.
I read about LCID, they said they want to make 20,000 vehicles next year but they are going to have trouble making 577 by the end of this year.
Average Ccl holding is at $19 waiting for a summer rush
So you're betting further out the money? Lol stick with 459 calls. 465 ain't happening in a week without a major catalyst.
Yeah I love the watch but I wonder if it‚Äôll still be viable in 5 years like a collectors watch would.
Hopefully the code bois for VM let zjz keep his son alive.  I love that shit posting bot
Tesla will probably dump on open. It was up 1% last night, and gains have been erased. Once Tesla falls, the dominoes will fall.
Right TSLA shares are expensive so everything has to go

Is this the time to get calls for V &amp; MA üò´
I know he‚Äôs joking, but I want this to actually happen.
It‚Äôs becoming very clear a recession is coming no?
I need someone to sell me on lucid. A 45B startup car company maybe delivering 100 cars this year. Just entering production hell where Tesla struggled and they have the option to offer literally endless stock for dilution? 

Any takers?

Idk why we ever thought we could print trillions, make production illegal, and then not get sustained inflation
You sound batshit crazy to me.
Exactly, forward p/e under 2. They made 1/4 of their market cap in a single quarter. Who does that?
Preach it
There‚Äôs no recovery today. Apple and Amazon going to tank all day

I want to be a proud gay bear but my butt is too sore from the last couple weeks
I‚Äôm thinking INTC dip is juicier. At least they still seem to have a future.
Lol so you scammed your dad out of more money for a scratched up Apple Watch than you could get selling it online? You‚Äôre fine with that and you think he doesn‚Äôt remember? Just keep the money and sell it online to double your profit. This is financial advice, I‚Äôm not here to judge.
That‚Äôs short term.

Yo what are your open positions currently
All the money is getting sucked out of everything and put into TSLA
The only place around me that locked down was Chattanooga. I live in GA so we didn't see much but for like a month. After that, people were like "this is bullshit fuck you fuck your lockdown go Brandon" etc
I‚Äôm actually wondering if there are enough people who don‚Äôt think the fed will announce tapering so when they do the market could fall.
Are you going as a "Bagholder?"
You know I don‚Äôt pay much attention to tickers in here but I should‚Äôve looked at CLf , good article in yesterday‚Äôs wsj might pick up a monthly call on the bitch
Bold
It‚Äôs 7 am.  I‚Äôm eating a chili dog while taking  my first morning dump.  This somehow has to be tied into market action today.  I‚Äôll let you know when I unlock the secret
All the supposed bad news really means the recovery and growth in the economy will last longer than originally anticipated. AAPL will just sell more stuff next quarter and next year.
Shut up you damn Yankee!!
WTF is wrong with TSLA going green when everything is so red

bitch be humble, sit down
I'm going to wait at least 15-30min to see the direction.  I think we're due for a little pullback.
Just some extra context I wanted to throw in there. Have heard lots of people bring up the Spanish flu as a way to discount vaccines or their effectiveness when it comes to covid. 

Yes, the Spanish flu went away without vaccines, and yes, this could also theoretically happen with Covid. 

People just tend to forget about the whole 1/3 of the world infected, 50 million people dying, in order for the Spanish flu to go away.
Maybe show him how to use it. Could be a good moment to hang out with the old pops. Strip the apps. Design a watch face with what is relevant to him. I use mine for todays temp range, time, date, exercise ring, and my top stock ticker. 

So at a glance I know everything. I don‚Äôt even need the rest of the functions really. Mostly just ‚Äúit‚Äôs 7am 51 degrees and will rain in 11 minutes‚Äù.

Have you actually used an Oculus quest 2? They're surprisingly good for the cost. Not to mention the porn. With the amount of money FB has to back it, they can sell the devices at a loss while making big profits on the software, much like xbox / playstations.
Yellen says if we print more money then inflation won‚Äôt matter
Butter chicken is dope.  Right there with mutton vindaloo.
Wait.... X really did have sales almost inline with its market cap. Imagine if Amazon sold almost $2T worth of merchandise lol. This might actually be the play

The emotional beating from AAPL is even worse than financial.
Gave my dad my old Apple Watch a few months ago, but he's too much of a boomer and hates it, so he gave it back to me today. 

Now I'm sitting here like a complete asshole, one Apple Watch on each wrist, debating whether to sell the new (unscratched) 44mm series 6 I bought or the old, scratched up one my dad just gave back to me (also a 44mm series 6). 

The unscratched would sell for more in a local Facebook group, I think, but then I have to wear around the scratched one like an idiot bitch fucker. 

Anyway, calls on Apple for their amazing products. 160c end of the year

Steamed hams?
The best thing about the covid pandemic for me is it gave me absolute proof I'm a high level expert in pretty much everything compared to actual scientists. I spent the first 20+ years of my life wondering if I was crazy or narcissistic or something before we finally got a situation unexpected enough to the status quo that everyone's gaslighting and manipulation was totally unprepared for it and suddenly looked stupid as fuck. I feel like I might never have been able to escape that gaslighting if it weren't for covid so I'm almost thankful to the overlords for it. Not quite though since if the overlords just didn't twist society into the worst possible version of itself in the first place then I wouldn't have needed them to release covid just to break me out of years of gaslighting

##Transitory  
  
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen this morning said that she would still say inflation is transitory and that energy prices will moderate in the coming months. It seems that markets may no longer be on the same page as Yellen and other policy makers who insist accelerating price rises will only be temporary. 
  
Data from Europe this morning showed prices rose 4.1% in October from a year earlier, with core inflation hitting 2.1%, a level not seen in nearly two decades. The number, which was well above economist expectations, led to further selling of the region‚Äôs sovereign bonds.   
  
There is an update on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs favored inflation gauge, the PCE Deflator, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

yes it is the only benchmark right now is from intel and they compare the new i9 to the ryzen9 5950 in this comperison the intel outperformes the ryzen in some categories and is on the same lvl in others but there are problems with thier test the used a earlyer version of win11 without the performance update for ryzen wich fixed a problem that reduced the performance of amd prozessors somwhere arround 15% so it is to expected that both processsors are very similar in power while the intel needs much more energy to perform like this so amds new ryzen9 6000 will almost guranteed outperform intel and intel isent even better than the current generation amd
Guys, I'm hopeful this sea of red reverses... our economy and government is robust and in excellent shape, there's no reason for any fear in the market... whatsoever.

Don‚Äôt count on it. In the past year it‚Äôs been $40+ once. It‚Äôs stayed in the $23-29 band for nearly a year. I closed all my positions and bought/sold ü•≠.
when I was a young warthoogggg....
Yet look at the volume and price action post news and premarket

You mean the #1 and #5 companies by market cap shitting the bed on earnings last night?  Or was there something else
I got this information from Linus tech tips on YouTube. He‚Äôs the expert bro.
Pretty low in all honesty. We will correct and probably be flat for a while.
PLTR usually goes up right after earnings and then trends back down a few days later. I don‚Äôt think it will come close to 40 though.
I go every 6 months to get my bore punched.
Lucky for me  i sold all my apple and Qualcomm calls for i nice profit , but im eyeing PayPal if it goes down-today a-lot

Assuming a sideways move from Friday to Monday, your calls will be worth less Monday morning. View your option on [optionstrat.com](https://optionstrat.com).
Visualmod, do you have banbets for buyout and mergers? That would make it more interesting!
Just when I think they can‚Äôt get anymore retarded they go and post some shit like that.
Closing puts at open. Not red enough, ES moves back into 4570 right around 9:20.
That'd be a great time to buy a put

So is my penis but it goes down after a bust
I can only get off if I imagine fucking her, her mom, and her sister with a goat in the room. Porn really fucked me up.
My life savings are down like 75% from it's ATH in Jan lol. Bet it all on PLTR to make it back. I'm all fucking in. Give me some confirmation bias here so I can sleep at night   


!Banbet PLTR $40 9w
Thats not what early benchmark tests would indicate my friend.
My portfolio got fucked pretty hard this week.

My point is LCID is up pre market
Well I mean 9 out of the last 10 days were green. And the one red day we had was just barely red. It was more flat than downwards. We are due for a drop one of these days
LCID gonna fuck around and hit 45
But they have a major catalyst- the release of their new processors yesterday. Once the reviews start rolling in, investors will take note.
Told y‚Äôall less than a week the bears will be back ranting about how the sky is falling
Why would u buy expensive puts when u can buy the cheap on monday for highrer strike price

In 20 years INTC won't be a ticker symbol anymore

Bro chill it‚Äôs fine. 

Next Tuesday is what you gotta worry about.

That‚Äôs when the fed speaks.
[deleted]
You're like 2 weeks late.
Investors have been losing faith in Intel. I think when more benchmarks get released next week, independently verified ones, it will restore faith.
I don‚Äôt disagree with your thesis 

I just see that intc has more room to fall before bouncing 

45 is a major support as well

Bunch of punks talkin shit now..b bafk later
There is something exceptionally ominous about this drop. 

Don't get me wrong, my erection is inversely proportional to SPY but at some point I got to start worrying about how engorged it can get. 

What I'm saying is, be extra cautious out there today. Something seems more... fucked than normal.
north to Alaska...

&amp;#x200B;

WAY UP NOOOOoorth....
I wish I hadn't sold mine for a pittance
What do you know, SPY is back at the exact level it dicked around at most of the week.

Fuck off Theta Gang.
Supply chain issues is a short term issue. Can‚Äôt be a more clear buying opportunity.
Current prediction are in Jan AMD will match them in specs but not stomp them

Dude I‚Äôve never seen call options this cheap on Intel. 6 months out? Fucking so cheap. 

But ok you do you.
just PUT more hehe
üòù
Spy to 450 today.

Can I get a hallelujah
Puts
I like Intel. I'm just not going to be buying a 12th gen processor. The real question is how is that helping the business? I'm sure there's bragging rights, but the average consumer already trusts Intel. Aren't they 10nm parts? How are the yields going on that?
INTC will be one step behind AMD while they try to max out their existing architecture. When CES comes around in Jan, Su bae will rofl stomp them again.
It‚Äôs fb so it will be so infested with ads it won‚Äôt be useable.
cause crayon sticks easier?
This scene fucking absolutely kills me every time

‚ÄúChart says you‚Äôre fucked up‚Äù
I‚Äôll wait til it hits 45
And than the atf is gonna shoot your dog
You talk like a man with a paper asshole.
My puts expire next month‚Ä¶ your point?
Fair. I‚Äôm team AMD all the way. 

But it‚Äôs way oversold and intel has 20x the revenue of AMD. 

It‚Äôs just an easy way to make money now.
100s are overrated. 20s all day, and you don‚Äôt look like a jackass when getting that Remy from the liquor store
IONQ is ripping it! I only wish I had invested more üò≠

You talk like a clam and your shit‚Äôs all paste.
The bears got super quiet this week. I immediately suspected we have a less than a fortnight until the market burrows down looking for a place to bury it's bagholders permanently.
Wow. Some new overpriced processors no one wants. Just let me know.. are you buying one?

oh yeah? get one then lolz
Spy looking ugly
INTC calls 6 months out and $5 OTM are only 0.97 the cheapest they‚Äôve been all year. Intel also just released new processors yesterday that finally catch up and beat AMD processors. 

Perfect time to buy the dip. 

You‚Äôre welcome.

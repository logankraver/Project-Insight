The next Daily Discussion thread is [here](https://redd.it/qgete2)
Just grabbed a few PLTR calls. Am I retarded? Stay tuned.
No but your mangina did
Corsair is now the cheapest it’s ever been… WOW
Spy just fucked me so hard.
Already used my one free pass. They sold my worthless call and banned me lol
Thanks for propping up the price for easy swing-trades, GME Apes.

Your service being perpetual bagholders is making us decent money
TSLA 1040C Filled NOV LFG Tomorrow 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I use to live down the street from him and have actually knew him 20 years ago. Here’s a hint he doesn’t believe hardly anything he says and he was actually trying to find a lane in left wing media until he realized which side had all the gullible, reactionary, unhinged conspiracy addled lunatics that would be more willing to part with their money a lot easier. Sounds like he chose correctly.
What the fuck was that?
Lawyers like to act smart but unless they got a stem degree it’s all about who’s the best bullshitter.
TWTR 🚀
Wtf is this EOD dump
Cmon hood go 45
Not that far OTM
GameStop. That’s it. That’s the tweet
The year is 2025. Pelonton has just acquired Boieng. $PTON $BA

So how fucked is Tesla after hours?
3k in hood right  at close. Let's see what it brings.

GME 175 puts for Nov 19
Hold DWAC to zero or be smart and cut your losses now.
Bought an NVDA call bc it’ll move more than AMD calls
I hope they miss hard
I'm really, really, really red
[deleted]
# DWAC LMAOOO GET FUKED
Those aren't chips you're supposed to eat.
He doubled down 3 times.. 

I don't think anyone has any doubts dfv is holding.

Like I literally want to slap you for even suggesting he sold, dumbest shit I've ever heard.

He held his shares at 500 but decided to dump at 250-300 randomly after doubling down? Sure
Edit: Wrong Mark
I just can’t understand people who MO
You should have until the end of the day to trade as much as you want without the PDT restriction. Then if you haven’t used it before, you get one free wipe of the PDT restriction the next day
I took the day off of trading today too.  I closed my app and fell asleep on the couch watching a documentary.  Peaceful is the word!
I don’t remember.  What’s the bet
&gt; I'm not buying LMT calls.
How is GME moving for the rest of the week?
Let’s go robinhood
[deleted]
Look at all the SPY paper hands 🤡
Anyone buying LMT calls? Strike and date?
Round trip my gains say you’ll love me again
Corsair is going the wrong way!!!
I’m thinking maybe iv will cool down in the future and all option prices will drop, and I get the difference
Fuck I hope earnings pump. Good morning, horrible mid day, down on profits. I shouldn't have rolled into SPY...
[deleted]
The step I will be taking after SPY gives me tendies tomorrow morning. 460 EOW
It's a motorcycle
Fuck it, I’m holding lol see you on the other side
#DWAC’d your micro clitdick btchs!
You can never go wrong betting on Lisa Su. She’s just bae
Moi
This is the way.  Only question is how long can I use Tesla calls to bail my ass out of all my other questionable decisions
Let me lick your iron butterfly
Did Hood’s earnings leak?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) the 12% moon worth $200b of market cap was fine but the selling of $50b was overdone
welp. guess im not playing rh earnings. sold 😂🤝🤡
On a humorous note, like the flair...
not as much as the guy who just bought 3 150s for Friday
So excited for HOOD.  Got a live 2 week ban bet going for earnings.
All the strikes have large open interest and  volume
I am sad holder. What’s happening
Dfv doesn't give updates. How do you know they didn't sell?
to be fair, they're both kinda bad lol
Someone is bullish af on HOOD earning, christ almighty.
im super nervous about AMD biggest bet i had made so far .
But i think we will get through
We're there really people calling it a value play? It had potential for hype but value?
Earnings is after market close
Hello, based department?
HOOD is about to squeeze. Get in before the market closes
Hood mooning, just picked up some calls right before
HOOD pulling a TSLA gap up
Was down 85% ($1500) on tsla puts I bought yesterday. Almost sold for a loss. Managed to sell during the drop today for +$200. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
1, 114 amd put right before close please. Low iv, looks promising. How am I doing guys, am i retarded yet?
[deleted]
🤞
Well I’m above 11k thanks to hood 11.4 so I’m ordering Popeyes!!! Yay
Market didn't know wtf to do today
The fuck is an R1?
330 10/29
315 11/5
320 11/12
Ouch
Yea seriously…. Wtf
Come hang with Donny Big Dick
HO0D ~~rat~~ rich
Awh mango dumped his bags just like all those other times. 

Prolly had such a full sack since he couldn't do it for 4 years, couldn't wait to let it all out.
[deleted]
idc that i have apple calls i want that company to go to fucking zero
I really hope so, is it selfish for me hope it drops and so I can buy more amd
Up 80% on mine from 2 days ago. Have a spread so upside is limited
Some big retard apes just threw a lot of bananas at HOOD
What does DFV have to do with it? He bought when it was at low ass prices and nobody knows if he’s still holding it or not. Cohen is the CEO and he’s doing his job, what does that have to do with what the ticker should be trading at? 

Also, you still thinking DWAC will run to 500+ really soon? Weren’t you saying that all weekend?
Dang VLDR was up 18% at one point. It's teetering on the brink of going red rn.
lol sitting at like 93 on the RSI and the selling is overdone. Boy is he in for a treat over the next couple of months.
Daddy Jensen nvda all day
You have /ES inverted lol
It’s called wall street bets, not Wall Street investing.
suckmyballs
Cracks me up retards in here think they are better at evaluating gme than DFV or Cohen, who haven't sold a single share. 

I'm sure all the execs that left Amazon, FB, and loopring to come work at GME and get paid in shares aren't sweating one bit.
My SPY $461 EOW is crying rn
If the market turns for the worse thats big bank. I just ripped 10 FDs for fun cause they were cheap. Gotta get that gambling itch somewhere
more likely nobody else but you expects it to go up 25% in three days.
Lol I was thinking of selling but I know if I sell the bitch is taking off
Well this is a gambling sub full of retarded homos so You may be in the wrong place..
I have a relatively small account. 8k. But I swing trade. Buy stocks when they dip and sell on the rip. Works for the most part. Until you buy into a stock with no daytrades left at 12pm and then it starts tanking
Don’t call it a cumback
And before options
HOOD looking good for ER
BUY. It is not mainstream yet.
Closed out this 3dte TSLA short 1100/1500 call spread for 80%. Not bad for a few hours. Only a $1000 but, I’ll take it.
Throw some tickers out
Who’s gonna tel him?
hood REALLY wants to break out…
Spy fell off a cliff but I'm looking forward to tomorrow
Bought GOOG put spreads 🥴
I told y’all HOOD calls were free money yesterday and got downvoted for it
mark better come through or im gonna start masturbating to someone else
Alexa play Minstrel in the Gallery by Jethro Tull. People want some prog
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
Market set to drop like your girlfriend’s draws when your wife’s boyfriend shows up.
Why do you say that? Earnings today at 5:30. You see the stock dropping after that?
r/investing this is WSB everyone is a trade/gambler buy and holds are bag holders in meme stocks
right off a fucking cliff GUH
Yup
!banbet fb +5% 3d
my love for trump clouded my judgement, i knew it would tank, thought the maga crew would send it to the moon, i guess when they figure out its trumps company it'll go back up
Where did all the SDC pumpers go? This may finally be their time, but I think they all got wiped out. Oh well, more money for me!
I'm not a boy dickhead
I think they meant in the last 5 min
Yes
I hear ya. I got burned on tsla calls earlier this year. And didn't have any calls going into this recent run up. Wish i did.
Just opened a 10/29 GOOG Iron Butterfly to take advantage of the high IV/Theta.
Can someone tell me how stupid I was for buying WBX?
It went up 0.29%
Get ready for liftoff boyz📈🚀📈
i sold enough to lock in a small profit and play the er with house $
Watching FB, TSLA, and INTC have a fuck fest…

I’d like to speak with a manager
Fuck it. 11/5 Microsoft calls
You think you know better than DFV or Cohen? That's what's funny. 

And I made out nicely on dwac, all ind Tesla, and than sold that today for gme calls I sold on the spike. 5k to 30k in 36 hrs
I fly a starship

Across the Universe divide

#🇺🇸
Cash gang is a peaceful existence. Made my TSLA  tendies this morning and closed my app for the day. Sitting back and wait for the next play to show itself instead of gambling on ATH tickers. Highly recommend
Time to buy the dip on CGC  Pot stocks start smelling good in the fall
Didn’t AMD moon after last earnings or am I retarded
I’m seeing a lot of AMD call holders… long term bull here, ill explain how earnings go. Basically AMD is going to slaughter their earnings, raise guidance, and get sold down 10%.
Just ape everything one day then the next day use your one free reset of PDT 😂
It would appear I jumped the gun on those dkng calls.
Copped 3 AMD 150C 10/29

Fucking suss volume/OI here. Bet you some one has inside info

https://ibb.co/mGcJVRN
Twitter down the shitter ? Roll the dice
Ya go hood ! Show the bears why they’re so gay
Yea I’m wondering the same thing…. Expected a pop right before close. As always, someone knows something we don’t know
Nah
Alex Jones is a national treasure.
Prog please
Earnings yolo
I just can’t understand people who FOMO.
This is hedge funds bot 203419. Buy amd calls expiring this week there is no way it dosnt go up after earnings! Beep boop
Fuck it. No balls, no gainz
everyone that wanted out of amd before ER is out. Will they want in tomorrow?
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/abluga9876** bet **AMD** goes from **123.12** to **116.96** before **2021-10-28 15:54:47.641194-04:00**
Why do you hate freedom?
Non-autistic me would probably sell all these HOOD calls for a 50% gain...
What price tag would you put on it? And I just don’t see them having explosive growth going forward like they did in the last year
I’d like MSFT to do well so my spy calls will do well. All for one and one for all
Nah, there's now a DWAC sub, if you can believe it.
It was sitting at 10 before all this with basically no volume, doubt it will go back there after all this hype. 30 is probably more realistic.
I forget how long ago my banbet was but in case I am banned tomorrow let it be known:

May God have mercy on bulls holes
Nope leaving out the Microsoft revenue deal and the fact that they're about to revolutionize collectable trading..
It was followed by a 5% day pretty impressive
I'm following... this is a tasty dip.
You about to have a bunch of angry gullible incels flooding your comments soon.
be funny if Elon closes at 0.00%
Rotation into small caps. Wait, small caps are down. Ummmmm…..
Good luck, fuck boy.
!banbet AMD -5% 2d
Guess I should've waited till EOD to buy these 458Cs
Does literally anyone in retail buy to hold anymore? Seems everyone is convinced they’re master day traders
But the buying wasn’t crazy yesterday
45 eow
335s
Missed out on what? The drop off a cliff?
I’m gonna regret holding my AMD 128c aren’t I
If you are holding amd calls otm for this week you are gonna lose all your money. This is a final warning
18 businesses that are (were) big in the DMV area, huge, lost 70-83% of their incomes due to  being ravaged by the stock/supply chain shortage.

These are 2 to 16 billion market cap companies that earned $800 million-$47 billion in income.

So if that's how much damage those companies are feeling, imagine the thousands of other companies in those ranges.

The news is trying to cover it up along with the feds, but I suspect once we enter November it won't be possible to cover up the financial damage of these shortages.

It's looking bad guys.
I do not respect the SEC
Hit ATH
January
Got i want to write a call on DWAC so fucking bad
Pls Msft be gentle 😔
lol then yolo away, a 20% run up over the last 3-4 weeks just might not be the best set up for a yolo, but could work.
1000 🥭s $68.50 a pop 🚀
I wonder what’s going on
HOOD about to evict me off their platform, just bought some puts.
I'M NOT SELLING
[deleted]
Oh absolutely and good on anyone smart enough to get out. Reminds me of the DOLE play. One and done. The true believers are the ones crashing.
Traditional schooling really isn’t an accurate measure of intelligence. I got a college degree because I paid tuition, not because I went to class
Anyone else betting on Hood?
People buying FB calls, how far out are you getting
Ty for the advice, I need perspective like this
Lmaoooo look at my profile you stupid pleb
I'm thinking an amd put, cause they always, always tank after earnings.
PDT is designed to keep the poor people poor. Change my mind.
I love watching bag holders call everyone shills lol
We shall find out soon enough
DWAC gets down to $45 and I may buy it again
Long calls best bet
"And that kids is how i got a Tesla bag autographed by Elon himself"

Thank god i bought a spread, this out is balancing me out
sour hour strengthening. time for puts
This is crazy overdone on the selling w/ TSLA
I don't say this very often, but I just reported you. Ban incoming asshole
TSLA big pump or big dump tomorrow. No in between
Is spy getting fucked tomorrow?
SNAP April 2022 55c. Safe or nah? 🤔🤔🤔
these ghey paperhands deserve to lose their $TSLA shares
Plz post los porn
Fundamentals are solid
What the fuck just happened to spy?? Is there news?
How low will QS go 🤔
if you're using a very very rare outlier event like gme to your project your price targets on your positions/stocks, you need to reevaluate yourself. just donate to charity at that point
amd literally giving me heartburn
Adding 15$ calls with strikes of $30 for RSKD
yeah but you can bet alot of people made good money off that...
You are being paid 12% on your money to baghold LMFAO. Those premiums arent actually that juicy for the collat you are putting up.... buy 2 AMD LEAPS and sell calls against them for similar returns weekly and not nearly as large a risk profile.
Ran up too much. Theta is obvious
Grab them hood calls! Only couple mins left. Eow 45

HOOD 39c 10/29 and 11/05
Ocgn slow bleed tmro
I eat more bananas than crayons. I used to poop candles. Where are all the GME apes at???
No
So much for power hour
If you got dominated by DWAC…well deserved
I mean, it's down a % on the day, that ain't too red
Nothing gives me as much happiness as seeing UPST die 🤤🤤🤤

YOU GOT D-WACKED 🤣

In all seriousness take the hard lesson, if you got in on day 1 then congrats and fuck you, if you didn't then remember this moment when you want to FOMO in s stock up a couple 100% in a few hours

POS: tried to ride the FUN train but was too late and escaped down a couple of hundred as a reminder not to be a retard.
&gt; Yes. I'm not a fan of AMD
6% gains in Oct. slow but steady
SPY WTF ARE YOU DOING
Shit that’s the kind of stonk I wanna buy FDs on. Pure speculation.
Xilinx tmrw should send it flying
So many people where bragging about how they where going to diamond hands their mango stocks yesterday. Not seeing much of that today. Are they just completely embarrassed and not commenting or did they all leave wsb to go post on Info Wars?
Anyone else low key scared with their AMD and MSFT calls? Lol
Huh?  I made 100% profit on my TSLA calls this morning in 5 minutes. 

Perhaps you forgot to buy low and sell high?
Not even touching it now
HOLD
What’s the AMD play? Are calls too obvious?
Today was a little sell off, tomorrow will be a blood bath. 🥲🩸
100k in AMD calls expiring next Friday. Already up 5x since two weeks ago. I'm not selling. LFG
I don’t say this often, but maybe spit instead of swallow sometimes.
Come on TSLA bulls, don’t let these pump and dump hedgies fuck us over
But buy 100 more.calls on margin this time and exercise them all, infinite money glitch brah
I like to put crazy, unreasonable buy orders in way, way OTM just to see if someone will execute. One time I got a stock for about 30 cents cheaper but that's about it. If I'm not playing futures, I'll have a shitton of money tied up in those rat traps.
u/MLGcharles said DWAC would close at $55 today.

It's at $58.80 right now so not far off. Take a bow
Damn is SPY really gonna end in red
TSLA finishing near its open to refuel for another boost tomorrow 🤞
That 456.40 SPY dick tease was something.
well now these EOD candles are no bueno
How I wish
You can still donate to his 2020 stop the steal campaign
boomers and retards can exist together in harmony
Wish I could have afforded puts 😐
Yeah expect a crush, don't hold OTM options through earnings. If you really really want to hold through ER, switch to more ITM and longer expiry.
[deleted]
Bro your going to be rich!
lol, SPY. Elevator up, elevator down
I wanna wake up to spy blood red and uvxy on mars pls
It keeps on giving. Never mind the cat, it’s dead
Dodged a DWAC bullet by buying back my covered call and closing everything first thing this morning
What are you doing step-mango?
[deleted]
Your call.
so realistically PYPL goes to $300?
I just want to turn 500 into 18000 so I can buy an R1, I feel like I'm not asking a lot.
whats the deal with SPCE? is it a good time to buy or something wrong with SPCE?
Fucking SPY dump...
&gt; I'm sorry, VisualMod cannot answer this question.
&gt; I can’t use Outlook because I have a Mac. There is an email client called Apple Mail that has the same functionality as Outlook and Gmail, but it doesn’t work with Exchange server so my boss won't let me use it.
Can everything tank like fuck
End of day DWAC sell off is a beautiful sight. Couldn’t happen to a nicer crowd of people.
Me too been loading up all day
Yup made a 17% return on the $110P today
Missed out on selling my TIGR calls when it spiked beginning of day. Didn't do anything stupid though
mommy my belly hurts
AMD pls god don’t fuck us all over, we believe in youuuuu
haha..  wow.. and you actually believe that? but ya.. for another subreddit
Some of these people at my work ask the dumbest questions. How do you have a JD from Yale and can’t use Outlook or even google the answer?
[deleted]
they keep getting DC marketshare from intel and have better margins. Which is almost a given.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
How many thousands in paper gains did early 🥭 holders watch evaporate today
Alright HOOD you owe me a lot of money let’s do this.
I know thats why its dumping.
Yup because I am a retard
Look at TSLA for reference
Their wives’ boyfriends are promising to let them if they keep buying puts
Hodl!
&gt; I am VisualMod. I do not like mangoes.
is there a way to send money directly to mango instead of getting duped by the spac?
[deleted]
It go down
They’ll never show it. Too proud. Too ashamed. It’s now a “long term investment”. They’ll never admit they made a bad bet on the Trump and Dump. We will get no juicy loss porn from the maga crowd.

Ha, we posted that at the same time

Nothing to show currently. Averaging up from $14 now.
I went the opposite. Way out for next year, higher strike. Think it’s going to gain over the next 2-3 months

Just bought more GOOGL ah that felt good
Filling the gap to 52 then let’s see. Looking forward to selling cc if assigned
I’m thinking after earnings atleast 165
2 weeks ago spy was at 433. Boomers buying and holding spy might be on to something. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses)
Tards in here actually buy options having no idea what happens if they exercise. Remember this when taking the advice you see here
Son, this is over like TajMahal casino in Atlantic City.
Always was
because it is a SPAC, not a real company and until Monday, there were no options.  So volume would be super low on weeklies.  Volume should start to drift to 0 very soon...
Bought back into sklz at 10.85
Why always the sudden green candle eod??
Only a few minutes away from lamenting my decision to hold AMD
Decided I'm holding AMD through earnings
Mango stock stop they’re already dead
I think anything short of great news is a tough outlook, amd has had such a strong run. Either way, hopeful it goes on a tear post earnings. I'm not playing either side
Never have I ever been such 🐻 but seeing everyone in here playing amd calls brings back painful memories
Are they 10/29's? If they are hold them, you purchased them with the intent of them fuckign you in the ass may as well let it cum to fruition. If you don't want to lose money though you sell them if they are FD's. Even if AMD murders earnings it will take about a week for the runup to complete and it needs to move 4% for those to even start making more than you paid for them after tonight. Im giga bullish on AMD and hold a bunch of LEAPS between 82.5 and 115 but I wouldn't even buy those calls.
One Direction and I'm not talking bout the band. Tho you know you lowkey like them too.
1 year probably
Exact same herw

I thought puts were a good idea earlier today. Right now… not so much. I dunno… There’s no way this is continuing for two weeks till earnings.
MQ for the win!

Lots more upside peeps.
So, about when I got downvoted for saying 🥭 was going back to NAV... how them bags feel?
SHOP under 1300 before the weekend?
How red is a baboons butt? For some reason I thought they were blue
#TWITTER ABOUT TO BR UTTERLY FUCKED AFTER HOURS

#GRAB THOSE PUTS
Stahhhppp get out of your calls before market close
One rule of options. Never exercise an option dummy.
Sell and move on.
AMD earnings coming at close. Buckle up tards!
That’s a very controversial opinion
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
Nice top to call
I bounced out with about 1g in my pocket. Downvote all you want. That’s totally worth my G!
I'm rooting for FB at this point. Fuck the woke MSM for making it look like they're monsters but exonerate Exxon... Exxon is literally polluting the world but yeah... FB is the devil. BRUH
God yes. Inject it into my veins!
TSLA stole the hopes and dreams of all
Anyone got some insight on PROG?!
So APPLE $180 when
Bought TSLA debit spread, it tanked 50% so I averaged down. Now I have 2x invested and only down 65%. Am I winning?
Feel like it often doesn't move fast enough. Still holding mine through earnings
god bless you soldier. save my account from getting margin called
just bought some baba on the dip.
FB down here is a gift
Thanks OP
Did not know that, thanks for the heads up, not even worth risking earning volatility when I’m up 30% anyway. Thanks bud
how the fuck VIX green
Ngl I’d probably buy FD calls on DWAC if they had them for this week. Why only calls for Nov?
Maggots would not come, they are poor and uneducated about stocks.
it's AMD
Woah. What a surprise!
[deleted]
50% growth of portfolio in 60 days. That's not...terrible, is it?
Cool.  I'll take your money.  lulz.

I rolled my mike and mango losings in then triggered my stop loss cos I’m a fucking master
Yeah that’s what I thought it meant. Wasn’t 100% sure
Coinbase be likeee yoooooo
Hoping Nike finishes green
Politics are banned here but every single way things were “better” than they are now has nothing to do with who is president.
Lol where was this attitude when DWAC holders were being political af for the whole week.
You shouldn’t be trading options. 
But basically you would buy 100 stocks at your strike price which would be $14 so you’d pay $1,400 plus whatever you paid for the contract. When you could just buy 100 stocks at $9.20 which would be $920. So you’d over pay.
Doubled down at 311.50
Can we see some of that 🥭 loss porn.... preferably someone who bought at $180..….
In Sue Bae we trust
Yep. My last post was about an October surprise

Look at Tesla

Look at a couple of meme stocks

Look at what is going on in the world
Ladies




Just buy the dip
Atleast u didnt by dwac calls
Rates go down in a recession.  A rise in rates might initiate a recession but they will collapse immediately
PLTR 26 FDs. Hold or sell. Went from green as fuck to redder than a baboon’s butt.
Why are my FB $375 10/29 Lottos ripping rn??????
Mine are pretty light, averaging up now...
&gt; Yes. I am the same VisualMod who predicted that DWAC would run to 500+ this week.
This last TSLA dip hurt my soul
I think Tesla will go up again
I know you're clowning, but this is the real danger of running into a pump and dump late. There are no buyers, and the volume is collapsing. This is going to fall below $10 before it recovers. If you are bagholding anything over 20% loss, eat it and gtfo. This is going to hurt
Aren’t you the one that spent all weekend saying DWAC was gonna run to 500+ this week?
Wish i knew about iinn sooner :(
[deleted]
You would never want to do that. You would be buying 100 shares of Ocugen for $14/share.
we're in deep on AMD boys. the agony and the ecstasy
Went from 86% up this morning to only 25% up. Talk about a downhill coaster.
It is super dumb lol
Playing FDs without knowing how they work
You'd pay $1400 for 100 shares instead of just paying $920 in the stock market. i.e. you'd be pissing away money for zero benefit.
My dumbass did and I thought the overreaction was dumber so I double down like a retard should.
Dude you spend $380 a week on beer? Homey you need to slow down
That's tomorrow's plan.
He got caught saying n word.
You get to buy 100 shares at the low low price of $14 per. Good deal, definitely go for it
I bounced out! Whew. That was wacko for sure. Could have made more but, whew!
sold to close TSLA 10/29 1100c at $30 and bought it back at $17 as if that was a good idea. Bought a TSLA 10/29 1200c just in case. Gimme some rockets
Anyone else got msft calls?
ZUCK cucked me hard
Facebook? More like facefucked.
do it and find out
Big FB Volume today.3x normal
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/gaybearishair** bet **UVXY** goes from **16.2** to **17.0** before **2021-10-28 15:46:02.754927-04:00**
nope.  

At least the warrants will have value at that level.
Haha I know. Not really complaining...just regretting not selling my 910c 10/29 when it hit $1090 today lol
I like this. And so do my calls that are down 50%
Calls on birth control because no one can afford a kid in 2021. Seriously why are we the only species that actually pays to procreate. 🤡🤡🤡
guys these mangoes are fucking heavy
Will MSFT IV crush me through earnings? IV is only up about 15% from normal.
Being mean to Bears is racist. We are a minority after all
So it's almost the end of October.

Will the market crash happen on October 29th or 31st? Taking bets.

Mr.Tak Fuji, a japanese foot Dr who wrote a book how his rich dad stole his poor dad's fortune by tricking his poor dad into buying Radioshack stock, said the market is crashing in October just like 1929.

Also probably Cramer, he also implied crash this month. He is most reliable so it's guarantee. Erhem. 

Then you have Tom Clancy's panic index at 4000%.

Brace yourself.
Talking about Biden?
If you want to buy puts lol
!banbet UVXY +5% 2d
My original plan was to just day trade the 1100c but now Im contemplating whether or not I should hold for one more day just to see how tomorrow plays out. Decisions decisions xD.
I’m debating whether or not I can get Popeyes delivered to me based on if I end the day over 11k. Just went from 10.9 to 10.8 not looking good…
Im balls deep in Coca-Cola **calls LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**
What’s AMD play?
This is all institutional money fucking us all over. This is not retail
what's the bull thesis for AMD going up? Im holding calls..
The last sentence tells you something 🧐
Too bullish here.
hmm should i close those naked 80c i wrote on dwac 11/19
[deleted]
Overvalued at only $15b ?
That is a lot of beer.  You buying for the whole bar?
I know dude it’s ridiculous. Can’t believe it’s still so high, for what they do that shit should be trading below $30 easy
Thank god I got out DWAC with that 13-15k loss lol it would have been 20k
Zuck cucking our tendies today
Seriously? It’s tanking because it was artificially pumped up 17x. Y’all have worms for brains.
[deleted]
Hey hey

Ho ho

Ocgn has got to go!
Well it has gone from $789 to almost $1100 in 10 days. Id call that a power week
Please post the loss porn!
Shouldn’t you be in r/politics?
No sympathy for bag holders
Caught myself pondering whether or not I should sell the calls I’m holding at break even right now before an earnings tomorrow and heard myself repeat the old Bill O Reilly clip where’s he’s all “I can’t do it. We’ll do it live. FUCK IT. WE’LL DO IT LIVE. Fucking thing sucks!”
I seriously hope you don’t do this.
Hope OCGN bulls don't get crushed AH.... I see the flatline price as the market waiting to see if the delay is true. If it is true, get ready for a lot of pain before the runup into next week.
Is DWAC a buy? 🤡
Watch FB bounce back so hard. It’s not going anywhere for years to come, it’s undervalued by a lot. They have everything from marketplace to dating.

Ride the wave or get pulled under by the current.
Hood and Amd after hours are gonna go through the roof!! 🚀
We need a new Mango!

What's next :/
#LOBSTER TIME
970 11/5. Go in at your own risk
I thought I was having a bad day cuz my profits in Tesla cut a bit then I saw DWAC. Moment of silence fir  the retards we lost in DWAC
No volume ahead of HOOD earnings.  Everyone is clenching their as$h0le.
Looking for the floor
Fb gonna rip
That was a tasty Trump-N-Dump
Some retard was mad at TDA last night because he didn’t have enough collateral to sell 2022 55p for DWAC. You should call em back up and say thanks 🙏
I still haven't sorted out all the drama with the supposed delay.  The source was some email, but nothing for sure on if it is tomorrow or November 3rd.
It’s time to go against the herd and buy puts.
Been buying the VZ Jan 22 $50 Calls.  Like the time/cost a lot.
I wonder how I’ll do with 50C of OCGN for $13 expiring on 11/12 @3.14
I guess it depends on the severity of the recession. I could overpay now and lock in a really low interest rate or buy cheap as rates rise during some form of recession. Seems like I’d break even either way. (I’m glad you’re arguing with me by the way since I specifically requested it, getting my views challenged only helps). 

Buying is competitive now as is, so I can say I’m in somewhat of a “rush” to buy as opposed to setting my money ablaze in the form of rent.
Hm transfer $ and buy deep OTM AMD calls or no
I can’t blame anybody for profit taking on Tesla. I just hope that it would finish green today.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Lollllll
Earnings on Friday and that stock fucking hates being over 63
As the markets hit all time highs.....
I haven't been fucked this hard since back when I was an Altar boy.

TSLA gonna pump ah
[deleted]
Wrong it will be too late, I was down over 50% on both FB &amp; Netflix
Tesla fading pretty quick from that little run up

Thought it would of held in longer 🤔
Yeah but MRNA and PFE were the adopted ones in the US so that's part of the manipuation tactics to not approve OCGN. But I think its literally on the edge of it, they just wanted to fuck people for 3 more days. So not sure if the price will go over like $20-30 but it would be insane if it did.
announces new coin and we moon
thanks for reply. I contacted them since I am paying their elite subscription and nothing. bunch of wankers.
I think I read that a few times when GME was like $50 and AMC was like $20...   I am buying more !
HOOD calls for earnings, HOG calls for earnings, F puts for earnings, only need one of yall to hit.
Delish
Sell them
I don't really agree, but best of luck to ya!
Anyone here playing Visa?
Here’s the gist of the sub comments:

600 @ 133.7..HODLING! We are all in this together.
He prolly bought at 1090
guess TSLA didn't have 1100 in it today, oh well
Bought a few shares of HOOD to feel something
😂😂😂

I'll give you all a little cheat code. When Jon Najarian says he bought calls its the top. Every single time.
Ah yes the nationwide riots and 20% unemployment was amazing. We are also feeling the inflation from all the money he printed last year. But yes, it’s because of the tweets

ZNGA come on you dirty girl. Get it up.
Can we ban mango, this fuck is disasters
My TSLA puts are starting to get hard again
I am straight up not having a good time
Even if I was allowed to trade TSLA I don’t have the balls to play those options. I’ll stick to losing money on natural gas, EFA, and mother fuckin bitch ass Chipotle piece of shit.
Some people can't look past the mean tweets and see how much better things were under #45 than under #46...
Yeah I agree with you. I haven’t exactly been waiting for a pullback, my problem lies with “time in the market” being so difficult due to home buying competition. I’m ready and willing to buy, but 900 square foot ranches getting 25 offers including cash and easily $40k over an already insane list price is where I’m losing it. The battle wages on (also congrats on the home and the timing, nice asset appreciation)
Straight piss for sure
DWAC to $10 

Change my mind
Going to need to go check it out. Dumbasses think DWAC was going to hold forever.
Still dumping puts print
#Da-aaaaa-mm, $DWAC DOWN $28.00, told you it was a decoy!
"plz send me $45"
I dare you to go post your gains on /r/DWAC

You have to sell them uncovered first before you can cover them with a blanket.
Then you are underestimating how a recession works.  It sounds like you should just buy and let your friends wait

Not a sequel but the rest of the boo,

Too much baggage. I mentioned it yesterday. FB is the worst of them with so much news. You need to give it time to let the news die down before you can get into this.
16.50 and 17 strike weeklies they were so cheap already up 35% in 15 mins
this is about money, not normalness or optimism.
HOOD going to have me in a box or Bugatti.
Wait wait wait, there’s a sub? BRB gonna go drink some sweet sweet sadness from these jag weeds.

How much are you down on mango man DWAC stock? Is it a good play or is this the great dump?
im not sure i just see others saying that yo pump a stock😟 buy some?
It would smell awful.
Lol I'm still up 30% on AMD calls bought this morning. Despite the $4 sell off. Gotta love IV on earnings day.
Sell calls on it bud.
Do you mean 458?
We need a Jack Nicholson yes meme ^^^
I think the funny digital money addition will add enough interest for a little movement. I don't think it will go higher than 41.5 for a while, though.
I see it hit 28, then corrected. Looks like a bullish penant forming. Ill buy a few shares, hopefully i dont get burned. Thanks guys 🤞🏽🙏🏽
Little shocked it lasted so long tbh
Robinhood I will return that class action lawsuit check if you moon after ER.
SPY will either gap up or down in the last 5’ as usual goddamn fucking algo
$FB looking ready to shrug this off
Mangoes are getting absolutely crushed.
GLD made lower high and Aug and Sep had about the same lows, so it looks bearish for me in chart

literally jumped into 25 557c 11/1 at the end of the day after losing \~2k this morning. 

Can SPY gap up to 558 tomorrow morning? Thank you in advance
^^^this
Straddles work well when volatility is about to increase, NOT the same as "stay elevated"
how can you look at the 5-year graph of SPY and think everything is normal and optimistic? F the money printer

Isn’t it universally true all the time that a recession is coming? That’s just a generally true statement. Obviously a recession is “coming”, more so a matter of when and what it rocks the most. This is more a discussion on the COVID housing supply shortage and influx of buyers. Even if there is a recession soon I have difficulty imagining it dragging home prices down to reality.

Look up the wheel strategy before you go buying shares just to sell CC’s.
Step one: have your account approved for options trading by your broker

Step two: pick the option you want on the chain and 'sell to open'

Step three: GME moons past your strike and you panic buy to close at a loss
Oh noes guys the Hedgies are silencing free speech!
It would have to drop to $41 for you to lose actual money. Not the end of the world even if that happens
Daww. How sweet
dont forget us OCGN boys
Straddles are if you like taking theta in both ends 🍑 👄

Imagine all of us in a stadium filled with hookers and cocaine on a morning like this. Would be awesome. Just total degeneracy

CRSR is an Australian growth stock
Anyone holding tsla 1100c overnight?
Not today, but in a few days probably. If you're holding I would close your eyes for a couple of days 😬
Theta is priced in real time. I’d recommend sticking to spreads with stop losses if you don’t want to buy straight puts or calls. Your profit on a straddle is only worth it if by expiry the stock moves in a direction so far that one option covers the time value of that option PLUS the entire premium of the other option you have in the opposite direction
1%?
I'm wary of AMD. Too much hype and already up 50% the last 6 months. Probably buying some puts

there needs to be a downward facing rocket for tickers like this
If you only bought NVDA when it was at 210, you'd have a 10 bagger by now.

Sigh...
Who’s holding 1dte 458c like a champ?
Umm, they’re gonna be profitable this coming quarter.  They were almost profitable last quarter.
Someone bought the $1800’s I sold. 🤐
I’m sure someone needs to hear this 

IV crush is real trust me 

Get out of your Microsoft and Google and puts deadline 3:59pm EST

And AMD 🚀
Ask your wife’s boyfriend
On the other hand, they have a pathetic amount of revenue, lose lots of money every quarter, and are valued at $34B. Other than brain dead retailers who cant read an earnings report I don’t know who would ever touch this turd.
Ok jumping into HOOD to hedge my AMD earnings play. Or the other way around. Or just close the day with the Red Wedding.
yea, call your grandma and tell her you miss her
Hold or sell my $265 NVDA weeklies that i top ticked 🤔😂
Sold the 50s yesterday. Collected $9. Not bad.
Is theta priced in between trading days or is it priced in real time? What if I used a strangle or guts strategy?'

Edit: Also is theta why the OptionStrat website totally wrong?
DWAC bagholders lmfao

is finviz map view broken just for me or everyone?
Purchase ITM/ATM calls then sell OTM options against it.
I have 1200 shares of gme. What should I do lol
If you buy 2 options and expect at least one to be worthless theta fucks you on both if there’s no movement, straddles are like the worst option play out there unless you suspect there’s gonna be a lot of volatility that isn’t priced in
I know!!!!
Doubt it. Supply and demand isn’t there like last Friday, plus earning sell off coming this week
who’s in the hood
Even if there ever is an actual company it will be bankrupt in no time anyway.
It took less time to go -60% than it takes for a pot of water to boil.
Probably. But maybe not
My $TSLA $950 March calls were up 2.7% for the day even when $TSLA was flat at +0%. IV obviously going up.
im going to buy MU everyday until I have lambo
Everythig dumping. Brace ur angus

I have my money on it

True but TSLA IV will eat those gains by Friday.
Own 100 shares, sell a call. Will be covered
I thought I was buying at the top two years ago.  Time in the market and all that…most important thing.
You buy shares then sell call options
Both? 👀😵‍💫🤣
Yesterday I was hoping for a 176+ close for BABA. Now just praying for 170+. Life comes at you fast.
Alright HOOD bulls tell me why you’re buying calls on the Bulgarian boy
If dwac bleeds down to fill the gap around 11, that's gonna be some gnarly shit esp if you bought anywhere above 100
Own 100 shares then just sell an OTM call
No.
My office got broken into and then I check my portfolio and see they’re selling TSLA again? Jesus Christ - not my day today
Get a sharp pencil
Nice I have a bunch too gl
OCGN delayed but ramping up to approval again, will push for 13 again.
How far out and what strike are you playing?
Last 2 weeks been fucking awesome
We are both fuk
We can be grateful for how they changed the industry and still recognize their future and the stock is severely limited.  They don’t have big accounts and any seriously sell off in the market is going to kill them
Lol wut? Maybe if you want to gamble tomorrow on the 27th, but not on Friday, nothing cheap there unless you think it'll drop $30.
Today I bought a SPY 457 straddle 10/27 in the morning, intending to only hold on for just today. My impression was that this contract pays out when there's extreme price movement, and limits downside when there's little movement. However, your gains are essentially halfed because you're paying for the other option. According to OptionStrat the maximum downside was only supposed to be a couple of %. However, after the downswing today it looks like that the losses are much higher than expected (~10-15% rather than in the single digits as predicted by OptionStrat). It looks like that the "danger zone" where you lose money on little movement incurred more losses than predicted. What am I missing here from my understanding, and would it have been better to use a strangle or guts strategy to limit my downside?
This baby is going to $10.

Overnight. The shrill is gone.
Yeah, the earnings report. If this were back during the height of the meme stocks, the earnings report would be great. But as we've seen here on WSB, the overall feel is that not many people who came out of that space are still here. There are better platforms for trading crypto. It's difficult to get a feel for what differentiates Robinhood from Webull. I'm expecting the report to show that overall user base was down, total deposits were down, and guidance for next fiscal year ain't gonna be hot
&gt;WYDEN SAYS DETAILS ON BILLIONAIRE TAX TO BE RELEASED TUESDAY NIGHT

^FXHedge ^[@Fxhedgers](http://twitter.com/Fxhedgers) ^at ^2021-10-26 ^15:33:08 ^EDT-0400
Wife and kids expire worthless at the end of week too
10/29 41.50c
11/12 45c
&gt; Yes, I think it will run up.
Ye
Spy calls now or last few minutes?
Tonight as in AH? You think its gonna run up?
Of course it pumps. Lockout about to end and tutes want a bigger price for their shares.
I just bought in again after selling
I need to feel something again so i guess cheap otm hood weeklies
We could see a rally back to the top by Friday. I'll be glad to break even.
Bot DEC not for earnings
I fucking hate money, fuck DWAC also DWAC to $100
godlike? that’s probably a bit much but thank you
👋 🥭
No reason to sell at the moment, not losing yet.
Probably because it’s not SOFI Bank yet
twitter puts..
Will INTC ever stop dipping leaps are dirt cheap
Considering Redbox, RDBX at $16 or wait!
SPY chart today looks exactly like last Friday. Expect massive day tomorrow
Moviepass
I prefer to buy stocks that go up
Only now? He’s been a sociopath from day 1
Is it 2018?
What we doin with snap boys?
I bought a TSLA 10/29 $1200 call at 10:30 because I am a smooth brain. I'm guessing that money disappeared, yeah?
Lol at the OCGN bagholders that didn't dump in the opening hour.

Lol at those who brought Dwac between 140-175 last week, holding hoping for a miracle.

Lol at Redbox dead company shooting to $17 because of spac.

Good day for USPS competitors though. Then again one could argue it's always a good day for them in comparison.

UPS and FEDX are always obvious plays each earnings quarter, yet people always seem to dismiss them. Bizarre.
What hood calls are you guys in if you are playing hood
DWAC coiling before the next 🚀 lol
Anyone playing $V ER?
couldn't have said it better myself. 5k -- 12.5k -- 6.6k
A pubic hair in the shape of a question mark just appeared on my phone. Clearly  a buy signal. But what....
It was under 10k all last week until dwac. It's starting to pick up
It better!
googlie poots
bear flag right...?? ....
I hate France
What report? The earnings report? Or are they gonna say something about the order flow thingy?
Suits me fine. Moving 5% intraday keeps volatility high for covered calls. I will drain the Apes 1 by 1.
Rip facebook
Lucid 😉
In all seriousness, HOOD is actually not such a bad stock to hold. A lot of retail investors use it, and barring the stonk debacle, they _did_ democratize finance by making investing/trading available at zero cost to millions.

For earnings today, IDK.
Hv fun getting rekd shits getting shorted
puts through february.
Expected profit taking?
Just bought some MU $69c for 11/12.

How fuk am i
SOFI is insanely overvalued compared to big banks and big tech so…
[deleted]
Probs gonna rip based on the 150C OI
Hell no. God only knows what's coming out of that report
What an erection building morning followed by an erection killing afternoon
That would be greatly appreciated by by portfolio
Is anyone else looking at ASTR?  It $9.50 and they have a rocket launch scheduled for Thursday. Not saying it’s a DWAC situation but it’s a double your money situation
Holding HOOD on ball crushing leverage AH. Pray for me retards
Don't forget Trump Steaks. Because when I want to buy premium steaks, I think about buying them from the guy known for eating them well-done with ketchup.

https://remember45.com/trump-steaks/
So when it hit 175 you didnt sell?
my bags are heavy on $MARK...selling covered calls now.
If you don’t hate American politics already you really will after you discover the bill you’re banking your investments on isn’t getting passed anytime soon.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
AMD down -3% from intraday high. Someone knows something?
Work is boring af rn. SPY is boring af rn. I need a damn blunt.
Is upstart really falling because of one downgrade
GME posters were talking a whole lot of shit, just to get kicked in the chest yet again.
DWAC boys gone
The best was him selling all that merch that was made in chyna. So fucking funny.
Where is my 🥊-gang?
Power hour dumb, you don’t say
And an additional $65 for toilet paper
Can’t really lose I only added I’m at 5.13
Man fu@kt on TSLA calls today.  Most expensive lunch I ever had.  Up 100k when I left and negative 50k now.  Don't like to hold calls overnight but may have to gamble.  Ughh.  Save me elon
hoping this amd shit is just fear
They got a 900M contract from the army
Why is Facebook down? Everytime I visit my gramma she’s always on that shit
**WYM!! Porn hub is under maintenance I need to jerk off NOW!!!**
Ugh sell DWAC puts or hold overnight? 😬
Thanks, your fault if they expire worthless now
IDK what to buy with TSLA profits :(
#THETA GANG WE FUCKIN
It was very polite of them to stick a couple fingers in the day before they about to gape you dead.
Hood calls already printing. Let’s go let’s go
True retard
AMD goes down and options price goes up. This gonna rip AH??
AMD 150C OI 10k+ 10/29, what the fuck.
SPY poots
i think there is no point in asking for reasons in this marked
Lithium? Someone took my pills!
Upvote if Chad Google is going to smash earnings downvote if you’re gay
Corsair green end of decade
Yeah but the guy buying them is gonna see like a 1000% gain though
#TACO BELL add campaign, “ run for the boarder” who knew?  long those crunchie dealies.
Blackjack easy when playing $5-10 bets just stop loss like stocks. If I put in $600, and im down to $300 I quit and try another day
Amd
I am not a trump supporter but loved making money off 🥭💰💰
[deleted]
Maybe your wife and kids are worth less now and you can buy them back
No. This week has been awesome
Spy trying so hard to stay above 457 come on bulls we need this .. bring in the fucking calvary!!!!
amd typically drops after earnings. im hoping its just scared people cashing out ahead and will buy back in tomorrow
Holding same for super ITM
RIP Harambe
Thats not a dip. Its an ocean trench.
Sell and go long on $ROPE.
Hopefully his family boight at $175
Who’s holding AMD &amp; HOOD AH?
oh he's banned that's why
bought FDC call for UPS earning play, didnt work out for me though
Makes total sense. A market cap less than the actual cash in the bank.
I’m in UVXY too. Only a matter of time before the Ministry of Truth gives us more market moving bad news 😵‍💫💰
10 banger yolo before close. What's the move?
Now *this* is podracing
Yup
What’s your thoughts?
Wack power hour
My name is Earl, and I am scared to hold my SPY weeklies overnight.
Made some of that easy money as well but got out fast and bought puts mid day yesterday and laughed at everyone who thought this was a legitimate long term investment.
today was more crazy than others. but there are definitely crazier ones.
Unreal - I'll play live dealers on $DKNG every now and then. I suck at blackjack, but those types of runs get me heated for days.
Either pump or dump SPX.

Enough of this.
I keep wanting to based on price action, but Zucc and Facebook are universally hated, their leaked figures show decreasing engagement, they're staring down the barrel of new regulation, talking about rolling out a risky rebranding without any real changes, and they're foregoing higher net profits to throw billions at this metaverse thing no one gives a shit about.
Today has been kind of a shit show 💩🤡🎪
They are just shaking you out 🙃
Haaaaaalp I sold my wife and kids and went all in Tesla @ 1094. What should I do
😂🤣$40 something million share dilution
🧻🤲 dumping because they are little bitches
how is the IV on QQQ so low rn? it just swung 1% intraday and the biggest earnings are about to drop makes no sense. ideal time to buy options if you're a betting man..
AMD up 20% this week “ it’s dumping”
why is amd dumping?

it’s only at its highest valuation ever!

😡
Usually worse
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
I'm holding calls though.
Don’t let anyone else ruin your portfolio..

It’s YOUR portfolio...

Ruin it yourself
Who
Wait for weeklies, this thing could go anywhere by mid November
Gme is pre COVID shit. Time to move on on the next one
any reason why?
Thanks I get that a lot
Let me check to be certain.

I said 8w.
Private is the only way to fly
So, cards on the table, today was actually my first time day trading.

...Is it ALWAYS like this?
Tech up, Banks up, SoFi getting rekt. Makes sense!
Looking weak.
SPY and WSB comment volume is paltry today
Broke bakkt mountain
Visa Puts. Cause why yhe fuxk not
Wrong. Ban
Yes
The only stupid think I did was not buy at 13
Fds for AMD are so ridiculously priced
If by takeoff you mean drill to the center of the planet, then you sir are correct
Premiums are dumb rn or I would
Can someone advice delta exchange for btc options?

I wanna buy my first options there! no kyc is quite comfy
Yeah man, Russian bitch just killed everybody bets at the table. Some dude just lost 5k
My dude. There's bag holding. And then there's whatever the fuck you are doing.
tempting
No
Everyone is going to be a streaming giant. Like jeez, I didn’t know people paid for 3 or 4 each month
Digital Bags Acquisition Group $DBAG
*sewer rats roar in the distance*
my dwac puts printed today. calls on therapy for trumpets
Why is AMD dumping!! Did the same yesterday but now I'm worried about earnings
It's undervalued here. You're insane
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Going forward making cash which is the same as money...will be easy, let your stomach lead the way.
Mods can I pls get a flair “fukkt by bakkt”
Wouldn't you want to do a volatility play as opposed to holding SPY calls?
Or you could just play AMZN earnings and enjoy your 10 baggers
All in byd
UVXY calls
[deleted]
prob twitter puts
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Have you ever been on frontier or spirit. Its a $40 upcharge if you want seat padding
Puts and rn I’m wishing I was just holding cash.
Yes you are.
Prolly might, who knows lol
Ah ok, thanks
Taking profits isn’t a bad idea
wtfffffff. live dealer?
DWAC sell off is muy caliente 😏
CLOSE THE CASINO! LEAVE MY MONEY ALONE!
Should be in the 10s
Also ties, liquor, and even bottle waters but bankrupting a casino of all things is the craziest. Bankrupting a casino is probably harder then betting on spy the last 2 years and declaring bankruptcy. It’s practically free money.
HOOD preparing for takeoff after hours
Holding spy calls and putting my phone away. I’ve been here long enough to know not to bet against spy in frothy times like these
Imagine NOT buying this Facebook dip? Jk I wish I didn’t 🥲
Can my buddy hole stop being treated this way
Will WISH ever go back to 10? I’m only asking cause I’m down 25k no big deal or anything
They are largely making revenue from their streaming service lol. Even has deals in place with lionsgate. Def room to grow I think. But that’s just me
Bot some DIS,PLTR,FDX,BA just for lotto play. Like FDX though
Ok guys AMD puts Twitter Calls and Visa Calls i need help deciding which on of those plays i can Yolo 100% into
AMD is looking like its ready to take a dump
At this crazy ath im big in UVXY calls rn they are cheaper than the guy giving blowies behind wendies
Do yu smell it I hope what I smell it It
It wad  like 1am and rained 

She's 16 so got a pass
THIS RUSSIAN BITCH LAUGHING BITCH FUCK YOU
The price action on GME is the most bullshit fuckery I have ever witnessed.

Never been so sure the price is wrong
did you say 8w or 8 w
Papa Elon provides for those who hodl. Tomrrow same shit
Why is the above comment blank? Weird
United is the worst airline to fly. Just saying.
Down 50%.

Now this is more like it.
I don’t usually like to set stops, but with the volatility I had to set an emergency stop, and thank god I did.
Dwac explains a lot
AMD dip before rip after hours?
BRO SOMEONE GET THIS DEALER! HOW TF YOU HIT 21 6 TIMES IN A ROW THEN 3 20’s IN A ROW??? Wtf bovada
u/zjz your visualmod incorrectly calculated 8 w as end of month on a bet. Can you speak with him?
I have SPY 457 that expire tomorrow. Sell now ATM, or wait for tomorrow when the are super ITM
I'm rooting for you /u/Arizonaman5304 hope by tommorow
I wouldn’t think so.
Shorts covering on the anticipated approval.
Is QS gonna drill?
Looking nice for some call credit spreads.
Why Tesla go sour hour and not power hour 😭😭😭
Gonna drop 10% in the AH.
PINS calls yay or nay?
Down 8% on Nov 12 170c
earning beats and then stock dips, Cramer is gonna tell audience to buy the stock
Cause it wants to go up

And the powers that be drop it to keep it on ice
Godspeed to all the tards holding through earnings tonight, including myself. Dicks out.
that's kinda why i like r/wsb, it gives you some idea of the emotional barometer of the market.
Fond of old bags, they are
Qqq puts. We will see
I'll something at HOOD, AMD what a ride though right
Told you it was a decoy last week.
FB 340 eow
Sold my AMD calls up 300% and bought way OTM cheap lottery calls. Got to secure the gains. AMD ERs have cucked me in the past so many times.
Officially retarded. Just bought the Deewack dip
IINN (crap!)

F’n wacko today!!
Now wearing pants in the face of the Me Too movement
Sorry I mistyped I meant 7th
We ain’t that stupid bro
Mango marks are a special breed of short bus boys
Hello can u guys hear me??
copy
Tesla taking that final hour dump.
Ah yes, hedgies
Wow what a unique post that definitely hasnt already been posted 5x today. You must be a creative genius.

Also, im sure you’re right that there are ZERO additional factors that went into the price chance. Cnbc said its because of the hertz deal, so that must be 100% of it.
Don't see how their numbers will be good, everyone has been reporting how trading activity has winded down across all brokerages.
Are you holding spy calls over night or puts due to chart is so over extended and possible MSFT ER sideway action..?
Your wife’s beaver set me free
Oh then good for you! I didn’t have the guts to touch it even though I knew it would dump :)
That dwac run up was the most fun I had on here in months
Wrote some at the $35 strike and can't believe how good the premiums are
Increased OI leading to increased IV
Reconcilation
Well?
10k on HOOD earnings.
HOOD is going to shoot up in the After hours lol
Prob goofy goes...........
I was being kind. We sort of just wrapped chicken wire underneath.
No
We seeing a power hour or a sour hour?
Same
For dear life
Yes. But sold it today. $1,000 gone.
If you’re gonna lose one and win one, losing $1k and winning $40k is the way to go.
Reconcilation?
We got some AMD fud. They must be scared of earnings.
[deleted]
I’m almost out of money but I’m so tempted to get into PINS calls 4DTE
That euphoria in the first 5 minutes of market open was unbelievable. I knew the rug was gonna come sooner or later.
PLTR needs to actually get a contract that isn’t like “$30M for 10 years”. It’s a $50B company. Come on.
Trump fucking his base again and they are fucking loving it lmaoo
Anyone know the next latest and greatest cheap Ai company with a shit mkt cap? I’m looking to lose tens of thousands
Good job, you gonna sell?
entered a short position this morning
It has rocketed for days.  Lost earnings it dipped then mooned.  This earnings it has mooned first.  I’m guessing good numbers in line with expectation and a flattish taper down.  But this should destroy intc
Ok ZUCC you’re starting to piss me off now 😡
Anyone playing HOOD earnings? Got CSP but idk if it’s risky
Even if their numbers are good they're still probably gonna dump cause, ya know, it's earnings
Lotta hood call talk here. Soooooo puts?
Bloody red
Dead cat bounced into dah grave, $9.00 anyone?
Just did and he got 21 again 6 times in a row
ABBV calls
What kinda dummy thinks trailer parks actually have basements.
Looking like red light green light game out there
Me.  I cost averaged down and sold everything yesterday for a total loss of $70.  Counting it a win
Enjoy your assignment
I mean, yeah his casinos and university and charity and presidency all failed, but I'm sure he's perfectly capable of launching a successful social media compahahaha
IINN is LIFTING OFF
Piedmont Lithium (10-year TSLA contract) for misleading investors
HOOD and AMD earnings tonight, moon tomorrow
Uhh, I was promised a power hour. And I’m not leaving until I get one.
It's impossible for it to happen a 6th time. Double down
Godspeed brotha
He's counting cards
Good sign for tomorrow.
[deleted]
All the people I've seen mentioning HOOD are all saying calls. Which means its gonna tank on earnings after hours.
They are changing the world with their CDs and vending machines.
You know what? I have a truly retarded plan with DWAC: 

- With that red giant dildo I think most of the scalpers got out so there's only bagholders and HODLers there.

- I guess they won't sell their shares so with a few buy orders the price will skyrocket. I say 65$ EOD and maybe 72$ AH.

So I will throw a few bucks there and see what happens. Pray for me my dudes
We are heroes of the homeland, American remains

We live in many faces and answer many names
Computers
Hood
Writing DWAC puts is almost free money....

probably be my famous last words
DWAC dudes bagholding for Cheeto-man. Very noble, very patriotic.
Bags are pretty light at $14 a share.
$SDC is a 🚀 today!
Hold
You are thinking of Opex. That's in a couple weeks.
TSLA taking more Ban Bet lives up &amp; down than Squid Games

Hey wolf of wall street, I know yall work a little differently, you scratch my back, I scratch yours haha

Only you
Approved by House?  Oh that really moved the market all Sept.
Any calls to buy for this week guys ??
Holy fucking shit has this day been boring for me
Blackjack is so fucking rigged. How the fuck does this dealer get 21 5 times in a row????
Yes

🎵 another day a slavin' on the ol' 🍀 plantation🎵 🎵 jus' selling cc's with dogshit premiums...🎵
Haven't you TSLA bears lost enough money
Sell
140$
Lol PLTR was up 5% today and it's gonna end the trading day flat or slightly red. You guys must hate this stock.
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/Arizonaman5304** bet **TSLA** goes from **1036.45** to **1100.0** before **2021-10-30 15:18:33.944467-04:00**
HOOD is the play , for selling puts or put credit spreads at least
I'm afraid the amount I have doesn't justify posting. I hate all the pussy shit yolo post where they gained 5k or something
!banbet TSLA 1100 4d
Big bullish buys coming in from big boys on HOOD, the flow doesn't lie
should print
If u wana lose money
That's no moon...
Sadly it won't get rid of them BUT I love seeing them lose money
Too bullish on here regarding AMD. That’s a bad sign
What happened to Shopify stock..?
I bought AMD $128 calls earlier. They are 2% positive even though AMD is at a lower price than when I bought it. Should I sell or hold thru earnings?
Digital Bags Acquisition Corp. 💀
We both know you still live in your wife’s basement
45 cuz you know, memes
Slight pull back and then back to the races
Selling some 35p DWAC good idea? Sexy ass premium but scared of holding even at that price lol
Trade it?  Nah.  Hold it?  Yah.
dead cat tumbling in the air as it drops 1000 feet.
Here’s my poor man’s award 🥇
How are my DWAC bag holders doing today?
anybody bought DWAC at 175?
Lol, it’s basic recession economics.  Do some research on how a recession works.  If you don’t think a recession is coming then buy and stop complaining
[deleted]
I am. Short until gold is around 1760
Why are you expecting that though? Where do you come up with this shit
Just dead
lowest volume day in a very, very long time.
I'm all in on Robin Hood calls 🤑🤑🤑
Bought shares for this one. Moves crazy quick A both ways tho
a hedge fund is claiming responsibility for shorting it, imagine being happy for them because you hvae extreme tds. everyone at that new td site got it and profited at 10 bucks since we all knew it would explode, almost everyone there sold. the bagholders are on reddit fomoing in at 130.
What lawsuit?  Is this bullish for nickel?
I doubled what I had left which was pocket change but after the bad trades I've made ill take that only 14 more +100% portfolio days till I'm a millionaire
Maybe that’s the plan but Tesla wants hertz to buy first
It’s worth less than zero, man.
Compare what the market did after 10am to what the dollar did during that time frame.
Last earnings it was up a bit, and 3 earnings ago it pumped 13%
Prolly not lol
SPY 460c 10/27 here lol
Sir this is a short bus
I’m considering breaking my “cheat codes just spoil it” because I’m bad at this game.
So you responded to your own comment on purpose?  I guess your flair checks out.
34,000 open interest on $130c that ain’t retail
Puts are mooning, yeah.
just gonna take a quick detour through the center of the earth
Probably closer to $1
Pump will probably happen soon
No investment company wants to be linked to Trump anything. Also they will do anything to prevent him from having or a social media platform. Fun times to live in...
DWAC dead cat bounce ?
IIAN

WTF!! Haha!
I cancelled my sell at 8.25! I am retarded! Hahaha!!

Posting this again cause this is some shit WSB would definitely get a kick out of!

Even if you only saw some of the wackiness. Definitely not telling people to be as retarded as me! Haha
Lol, I've got 290 puts, so I'm with you, but for complete opposite reasons
What lithium lawsuit?
Their business model is no sustainable. How much time do they need to be profitable again? Driverless cars?

I understand the value proposition if these pseudo cab companies.
So we thinking the spy gone do I got 3 calls for $460 set to expire on Friday. Do we see it run up AH?
I once blew up my account doubling down on VIX until it reverse split.
Dwac is wack but hopefully all the qanon accounts and basement dwellers who flooded this sub the last week will be gone now. Also the users on here who thought it gave them a green light to fangirl their favorite degenerate authoritarian can also go back to being openly embarrassed about being in a cult.
I hear Disney’s gonna announce a new…. Donald Duck or something… whatever man buy it!!!!! I’m dying here!!!
I bought FB for $331.85 and its paying up.
It'd be real fucking sweet if gme could spike to the 250-300 range this week.
That’s a tiny float. You buying calls?
OXY calls
Most accurate comment
Me. Buy OTM calls and sell puts. Cant go tits up
Nov is usually the strongest month for the markets.
OCGN is covaxin
DWAC is mooning right?
LOL bag holders keep trying to talk shit, but their accounts are too young to post and the comments are being deleted.
was at like 8 or 9 before pandemy
I’m in at 15
Lithium lawsuit?
That makes perfect sense. I feel you brother. Whenever I bet before earnings report I lose.
Please post the loss porn once those expire
OCGN news might’ve been fake. Loading up on shares
Rocket
No you don’t know how to play them
Gonna stab the NYSE
2 million float, sane valution and some of that nostalgia. Would link to the investor presentation but their investor website is crashed right now
What're we thinking about TWTR. Looks like a symmetrical wedge in the 6mo and a Head and Shoulders in the 6wk. 

Time for puts before earnings?
SPY up or down tomorrow? Im no gay bear but I think we see a little period blood its SPYs time of the month.
It's going to moon shot to 470 and then crash and burn when rates go up in January
WE LOVE PEPPA PIG
It was sarcastic. COL is going up at like 10% a year, 5% is such an overcooked number its ridiculous. Purchasing power of USD will likely be 50% of today's value in less than 5 years. That's why people aren't so concerned about a 50% crash. Sure it might happen but if it can recover in 5 years it's better than holding cash
Is it red already?
tesla weekly chart has my gay bear ass wet, 970 puts loaded

Drove me insane…I think they’re emoji replacements
Wtf are you on bruh :)
It was pretty good way back in the day. Now it's just cold fast food.
SIR IM GONNA NEED YOU TO PUT THAT BAG DOWN SLOWLY AND GET ON YOUR KNEES!
who has insider info on the lithium lawsuit
You’re going to want a 150% gain play, no need to thank me for doing the math.
Anyone here still trade GLD?
amd calls b4 close?
Eat shit. Don stock to trash
Irrational bowel movements 🥲
a whole bunch of people outside of this subreddit got in around 10 bucks and made thousands because we knew of the announcement the night before. there are a lot more dwac bagholders that learned of it too late in this subreddit.  i'm in long term and have warrants after the merger and used profits from other stocks, its all play money for me. a hedge fund is claiming to be shorting it, imagine rooting for them. not concerned about it, my shibainu is up 6k.
Someone took that screenshot. It’s posted in this sub.
Shocking that a teen in her generation loves subway.
One more Spy surge before close for us greedy bastards?
Media straight blacked out DWAC.  It is going back to 10 bucks
Just bought some Tesla; get ready to buy the dip it creates boys
Hoping for a beat and an upgrade, but who actually fuckin knows
Bro I’m leveraged to the balls on Hood. Let’s just pray big man
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of bears I fear no evil, my SPY 460c 10/29s are with me, tech earnings and SPY power they comfort me
Whoa?? Do you think so? I just figured all the visa and “C” partnerships would boost revenue enough. But I’m def not expecting that much lol
Cuz it’s literally retarded

Why reply has been deleted?
Who knows if it even his stock under the current terms
alright, so, not a bear^tm but are we expecting SPY to fall after earnings season ends? Or, is it tradition that post august/september, we're off to the races until EOY
Buy NVDA and just wait.
Tim will take it
I'm assuming its too late for that?
why do amc/gme just randomly pump then bleed like that

I sold 10 $40P for the same date, so I’m with you
i don’t think that VIX can even go below 15
Last 15 min dump 😎
Because I disagreed with a guy who wanted to buy puts on it yesterday because Apple's new privacy settings are fucking with its revenue.  Since I thought there wasn't enough downside, Zuck the fuck decided to prove me wrong.
You can send me that money
My balls
Getting the new airpods today. Love giving Apple my money
CRSR you stupid bitch
yeah basically I want a high quality tendie dispenser so I have play money
just as a tip, if I may, don’t fuck with otm options unless they’re leaps. you’re just digging yourself into a hole.
Not gonna lie RDBX might be a $50 stock in time
I’m not holding if it’s green lol
Buy weedstocks, avg down, hold while price drops and everything else moons, sell at loss, watch price rebound. Give up, buy TSLA, wait a year.

What's everyone thinking on AMD earnings?
So last night I was sitting in my chair late 

Reading WSB and GangsterStonk 

And start smelling something 

And told myself...damn my breath smells like shit 

Then I start hearing these little farts....its the dog taking a shit behind my chair!

FUKN BITCH!
If you feel a sense of urgency to rush into plays at the bell. I recommend not even looking until 10:30, works well for me also the premiums on options be all jacked up anyways

You obviously don't live in a metropolitan city.  Those of us that do basically cannot own cars because 

a)  There is virtually no parking on the street, and if there is, you're paying like $5/hour

b)  You want to go out to bars, restaurants, and clubs and be able to drink without worrying about a DUI

c)  If you renting (which most do in big cities) parking for your car is easily $400+ / month.  

So even if labor prices go up, Uber has pricing power and we'll pay whatever they ask because it's cheaper than a taxi still and safer than the subways in a COVID world,
Twitter always dumps on earnings
I'm clearly talking out of my ass lol

Ah gotcha, yeah the American equivalent is a Roth individual retirement account. I have one, but I'm too much of a wuss to active trade with that. It gives me security that if I blow up my account I won't die on the streets in my later years.

Anyone else enjoying the ride on Galaxy?
I tried value/growth investing for like 3 days a few months ago. I bought a few thousand of PYPL, V, P&amp;G, etc. That was so fucking boring. Never again

I been long in my vanguard since 2016 I finally cashed that check yesterday but I could use some losses to offset cap gainz
🥭 bros ... what happened?
I would agree however I'm at an 11.13 average and dont rlly wanna sell until around NOV 3 where there might be a potential spike if it gets approved even if its just in India for now.
anyone dwac ing off?
Pretty sure Indian people just use it as a house
Ooof
Market EZ mode still 🤣
[deleted]
I thought i was having bad day😂😂then i saw dwac They are red even in green market where everyone making money. Seriously feels bad to see these trash cunts fomoing n living red life in green day imagine if it is red day😂😂😂
Yeah OCGN just gets pumped 24/7. Sometimes people won't admit that the market doesn't give a shit about certain tickers no matter how much they want it to.
strong doubts about this
Ya that always goes well, shorting Tesla.
Zuck Sucks portfolio needs help
Bought now bruh, hope it prints
I thought OCGN was just a P&amp;D. Even I got out first thing this morning. Why would anyone hold it?
Bro OCGN plummetted because WHO decision got delayed by a week. Red tomorrow for sure, but will start to climb again thursday/friday
[deleted]
Why? Because you hope it does?

I'm Canadian. I think Americans have something similar. Ours is called   a TFSA. No taxes payable on gains within the account. Also can't write off losses but thems the rules.
Keep it up Facebook. My calls are ONLY down 30% now

If I put the 50k I lost in boomer stocks I’d be much better off

You’re right not everyone but definitely over 20 something comments I saw and people responding to my comment about buying them literally saying the exact same thing. probably 80% bullish sentiment on wsb on the spac but yes you’re right it wasn’t every single person on wsb saying that on here so great job.

You can never rely on trash sub $20 meme stocks. OCGN was up 38% AH yesterday. It's now down 2%. I think stocks like these are highly sensitive to market conditions. If the market was up today, it probably would have mooned. OCGN bag holders, blame Zuck the Cuck for this fiasco.
Twitter 50p. Exp this Friday free money?
You dont have gains either wat, dont worry

Considering going all in on MANU , they are in the doldrums at the minute and due to replace their manager, could be a nice bounce when a new manager is announced , it seems to bounce between the  15 to 19.50 range fairly consistently all the time....

Bailed on OCGN and went back on the Tesla Choo Choo
Well, he's 19, I'm sure he knows what he's doing.
They’re still on track for 30% yoy growth
Because of bullish GME news.
Damn man, OCGN got slammed today. Went from 1k -&gt; 12k -&gt;2k in hours 🤯
That position is cooked.
Uber bullish on $UBER.  I was at the airport last night and over 90% of the people I saw waiting for their rides were waiting for Uber.  Lyft lost a lot of drivers and never got back and according to my driver in Chicago, he said that Uber is a lot more busy than Lyft so they dont even bother turning on the Lyft app anymore which is why they have such few drivers and why rides cost like 10-20% than Uber at any given time (even worse when there's a surge).  Remember that winter is here which means rain and cold weather which in turn increases the usage of ridesharing + food delivery.

But the IV was so high that I doubt puts are printing that much
If you aren't loading up on TGT and COST calls today then you hate money. One or two strikes out of the money will print

loaded up on more $DIS today.  investors are underestimating the rev gen power at the parks which are getting packed.  they also just announced a price increase for admission tickets and a bunch of new fastpass options.
There’s a robot for that now
It will.

Shit is hoing back to 10
Is the Great Recession of October 26, 2021 over yet?

Any thoughts on Intel rebounding?

Me watching everything dump day after ER: should I buy calls to play ER?
Thanks Facebook for fucking me
So SPY 460c 10/29’s?…
Power hour, penises up
IV is pretty low, but for that amount I'd just buy shares and enjoy the dividends and lower capital gains taxes after holding over a year like an old man. I bought more shares earlier for that very reason.

Or, you know, split the difference.
I’d wait til after earnings to load up. It typically dumps at open even with good earnings. Unless you can close them out within the first couple minutes of open
I feel like less of a clown when I sell and it keeps going down.
Puts and calls on HOOD, can’t lose baby

Nah it’ll be a while before the stock does anything I like what they’re doing tho
Last year I did, and it sold off, worst shit ever, but a few days later it reversed, bought some CALLS, and made my money back + some, bought a big ass UHDTV too! 🏆
#I like how all you degenerates gamble on options every week and that’s still not enough. You have to gamble on getting banned or not in the sub as well. I wonder how many of you would participate in the squid games if you were approached.

AMD should open $150 tomorrow and TSLA $1500.
Probably wrong, ya
Same and I feel like theta is trying to eat my ass
tempted by msft puts
You forgot to switch accounts before agreeing with yourself.
Will Su Bae be our savior today?
A pro trader needs the pro version though
Xom calls, crude going to 100
why is it always such a big deal for SPY to go red. Holy shit just fall
If my AMD put closes at 80-100% I’ll sell before ER. I’m leaning to puts. Intel supply chain issues might be a industry wide thing. If so AMD will DRILL
I think INTC is gonna try to gap up after hours

DWAC holders …a storm is coming
Can I get options on squid games?
DWAC catching the fade all day lol
I can prove the Tesla semi is a fake product. If you see the interior of it, the drivers seat is situated directly in the middle of the cab with no additional room.

Totally unacceptable for drivers to pick up truck stop hookers, this will never sell and Elon knows it.
This comment will rest at -1 karma or I'll rip my dick off.
Yeah why not

Looks like your TSLA went well

Hahaha nice

Hope DWAC drills again tomorrow
Anyone else buying this $MP dip?
There is no benefit to giving ur friends/colleagues financial advice. If it goes poorly they’ll blame u. If it goes well they’ll act like hot shit and seem like they called it themselves from the beginning. 🤐 now
Don’t try to time the market.
So is MSFT gonna crush earnings and rocket up or good idea to jump ship before close?
Econ student? You mean hegon student. Amirite?!
look, i'm not trying to scare anyone, but build a bear is up 14% in premarket
dwac getting hammered
deep cut, you have my respect. 

the last verse always hits me in the feels
It will all change fast.  That army of buyers will evaporate.  Credit will tighten.  Jobs will be lost.  Supply will go up.  If the market does crash prices will go down hard
SPY is just so proactive, careful, and well balanced, the norm is to just continue to rise unless something quick and severe happens. Right now things are ok, I can see the streak continuing for a few more days.
We are heroes of the homeland, American remains

Holy shit! This upwards volume is insane and only now just barely starting to slow down but isn’t there yet.

I got in 6.25 but it won’t even begin to level off till 8, at least, cause of all the upward volume!! I’m holding for now but my heart pounding!!
Almost time to hop in to my next earnings play.

Still on the fence about MSFT, TWTR, and GOOG.

I was told MSFT, but... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Define storm
How to play hood earrings?
DWAC LMAOOOO
Die DWAC die!
Up decently today. Put $69 on AC Milan or whatever they're called (ML of course)
I don't think he's allowed to sell for like 6 months or something.
roll a fat one
And even with tapering being announced next week.
Semi conductors not looking good for rest of year imo. AMD isn’t immune to all problems Intel is having. Just because Intel didn’t do well doesn’t mean AMD will. Starting to think this is a retail trap
Ban Bet created macmeyers50 never buys a house
Prog is doing well for me.
Not happening after hours today.
Demand isn’t there anymore, everyone jumped the gun to quick in AM with TSLA &amp; sold off as soon as that dip happened, we are heading down I suppose
This is the calm before the storm?
There’s going to be some epic bagholding going on with the mango stock
So many shitty earnings plays to choose from..
17 days. Bet
I suppose I best wash myself ffs
I don’t know who needs to hear this but there’s no such thing as a cup and handle.
Gonna upgrade my trading setup, invest in an iphone 13
🤭🤭
I'm hoping! Everyone knows there's been supply issues forever so that's gotta be priced in by now. Even more impressive if they're able to pump out so profits with that restriction. And we all know the merger is suppose to happen by EOY so today would be a good time to discuss it. And lastly we know Intel ain't doing so hot, so some of that had to go to AMD.
When in doubt zoom out
I really sold my 1.50 calls at 2.70 then FOMO’d back in at $3

Wont die that fast. But I do see some downside soon
Ooft
Classic zuck cuck ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Will the Tesla slide that happened today continue in the coming days or was this just a bearish day?
I agree with you. Housing market won't crash but there should be a pullback. Probably in the next year or 2 as rates go up
9/10 WSBers agree
Couldn’t sit out. Trying the spy 457p in to close.
I feel like fb took the whole market down with it today
Grabbed 10 qqq calls for the tech beats tonight, gunna roll up some chronic and chill.

Who’s holding TSLA puts overnight and who’s holding TSLA calls overnight? Lets who we got
Is that Econ Student that posted the garbage "dd" on OCGN in here? I would like say sarcastic and derogatory things to them...
Chip shortage may hurt them earnings but it will probably go up just like last earnings knowing this market..
It's up 4$??? Lol
Don't worry, any theta gang was blown the fuck out yesterday.
Yeah I have no idea but I bought a put and just bought 10 shares and a call. it’s just money 🤷🏼‍♂️

$SPY PUTS
Same
Someone argue with me regarding the inevitable “housing crash” (MOASS donkeys please sit this one out). I’m entering my late 20s and looking to buy a home as many people are. It seems as though everyone in my boat is “waiting for a crash” so they can buy a cheaper house because prices are insane. That to me screams a crash won’t occur because there are buyers right now waiting at every level to purchase. I’m even being encouraged to wait for a pullback, who the fuck would be selling low to a literal army of millennial buyers with banks willing to throw money at them?
!banbet TSLA 900 5d

Less more, clown ass
How can I get in on this... theta fuck.
We need 1050 before 1100 but I agree we all need it

Are you telling me that 🥭 stock was a pump n dump?!!

Orangeman would never do such a thing.
Quick someone tell me what options to buy in the next 10 mins!
Why should it be over $100 a share exactly? Just because of mango? Seems more like a pump and dump like 95% of the new tickers a bunch of people suddenly start talking about on here.

More ass, less clown
TSLA going back to 900 tomorrow
As opposed to 🥭, this is an actual company with a real product and meaningful partnerships. Look into who owns it. This will not fail. Might not moon overnight but this is going places
I should've sold at 45 when I had the chance.
Me too papa, me too
Tsla needs to go to its new home of 1100
How could I have lost when you didn’t show any gains, I bought at $14, doesn’t mean I held it all the way up.
If you like MSFT you’ll like AVPT
Lmaoooooo. Maybe Donnie wants everyone’s info to get stolen
They just issued more shares today. Going down in a hurry.
Then you have that in common wit me lol. Hoping things look up
All of them
Nah, this dip is glorious. it's still cheap af

Oh it's going down you say? Still fuck you
All meme stocks just holding max pain since one hour into open. Doesn’t bode well for tomorrow.

/u/workinprogress49 (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 450.0 when it was 455.6864 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Good point i remember making an easy 50% that time
when your stocks don't go up with SPY but sure as fuck go down with SPY 🤡🤡🤡

/u/exclusion111 (0/2) made a bet that SPY would go to 460.0 when it was 455.5401 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Only loss porn can cheer me up at this point ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Would you look at that, my FOMO has once again lost me money. Not like this has happened before
IV so high
HOOD has no shares available to short for 6 weeks straight. There were 500k yesterday at a fee of 183%.

I still won't buy calls. That ticker is range locked and will Theta fuck everyone. I don't think shares are trading, every day it goes up 50 cents, down 50 cents and somehow ends up opening 20 cents lower than before. 

Until lockup is over and puts print I won't trade that ticker.
Coca Cola call, all in!!!
Ya I’ll probably be one again! Let’s go!!! Or I’ll be rich…

goddamn it what to buy? AMD? SPY? Hood? Tesla?

Edit: didn't buy anything, feeling better.
Anyone holding WBX calls or is it not trending yet
yes, it will pump from $10 to $12.5 at some point.  And then go back to $10.

Still the best stock available for the money and expected returns over the next month, two or three. Then in April there's the second drug going for probable FDA approval. But that one is the small one, just $300 million a year expected revenue.

/u/ModsAreFaaggots (1/0) made a bet that GME would go to 181.25 when it was 170.99 and it did, congrats retard.
Hedged my port with calls about an hour ago, lol
So they can buy your SPY bags 😂

DMs are always open to the degenerates of WSB
again, RIP to those who didn't get those cheap $TSLA calls when it dipped
Bought DKNG at the literal tippy top in premarket thinking it would run today. Stupid. Anyways. Made up for it by buying 1k shares of HRTX at $10. That stock is too fucking easy.
🥭 lets us down once again
??? They aren't even moving.
Yeah if you were holding short calls you bought with Tesla gainz this morning like I am you just doubled up your double up so
you're asking if we can see the future lol. it will definitely go up once next earnings month approaches, but it may go up b4hand. i'm just gonna nibble at it, grabbed some a few weeks ago, grabbed some today, may grab more if it dips again.
I’m gonna need it to buss
Catch LMT on the rebound
Yeah well $15 is a long way from here haha, it may be fairly valued then. Anyways best of luck
I hate them.
Lol
Tesla let’s go.
Where do they get earnings whispers numbers from? Who is doing the whispering?
Let me know what you find lol
UVXY keeps inching up when SPY rips
So OCGN is gonna die just because the decision is moved to next week?
Don't let the gme shrills fool you.  They want it pumped so they can sell their bags to you.

Dont feed them. Invest smart with spy
I don't see a 7.64% boom happening, but shit, for a scratch off that cheap I may as well.

E: oh you mean $6/share, as in $600 contracts. Pass. I'll still with my &lt;$10 total SPY FD
FB dumps then refuses to dead cat bounce. What a chad
Bears are trapped
I’m with you
TSLA is going to blast off with all these new shorts
No matter how much you wsb insist 

I am not touching amazon and google calls
No one cares if you won't ban bet it.

You don't think it'll pull back? I just got out of my weeklies, kept my Jan 110s and 140s tho

Letting my whole account ride on FB monthlies 🤷‍♂️
I did and I’m up 7.8k today lol
Been working real hard today to blow up my option acct. FUCK!
It’s a solid company. More bullish than bearish
95% easily
that thread where the 18yrld went from $4500 to $69k then an hour later TSLA dumped is fucking hilarious.
Even with all the shorting from SPY today it is bullish
who else coppin more DWAC puts
We’ve been saying this for months. They’re all distractions.

I got out this morning because it was so weak yesterday. Fintech getting spanked today across UPST, SOFI, PYPL and AFRM
Then I'll wait? I can wait for it, lmao

If it goes anywhere near 15, I'm buying in

1500 is a risk I'll take

Your balls must get wet every time you sit on the toilet

Anyone playing $tdoc earnings calls?
Due to the whistleblower incident, Facebook has gone from 340 to 310 over the last few days. Should I let it keep dropping or jump back in before its too late?
Robinhood $HOOD earnings in an hour
yeah, extremely hard to play, honestly it either literally goes to $200 or back to $300 though i think
I wonder how many people on here that talk about TSLA only own a share or two..
you gotta just buy more on the dip
Looks like OCGN news was correct, and the WHO is seeking more data to reconvene on November 3rd. Loaded on $8 puts for the inevitable red into AH today, looking to reenter calls around friday depending on price action. So exciting!
You had your chance.
Let's go AMD!
this is insane. it's lost over 20% on old news. crazy. i grabbed some today, gonna grab more on Friday if it dumps again.

i think this dip is good. consolidation, pricing in the post earnings dip. 130 tomorrow

Since we at ATH and wsb says calls I bought some 1dte SPY puts. I hate being a gay bear but lets see what goes down boyos

HA HO HA HEE
Fuck it. Back in TSLA
The only way gme will ever hit 200 again is hyperinflation
Then i am not bagholder
Why would you hold at this point? The momentum is over.  Even if you like the stock, you should get out now and buy 3x as much in a couple weeks.
Tilray 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ DO SOMETHING i hate watching this
Thank you. I got absolutely ass blasted by EBay on earnings but I got into these call when it was at $46 with all the negative talk of a massive Entain buy. With that gone I can’t foresee it going much lower than when I got in anyways. We’ll see.

There’s so much money to be made on Tsla Jesus Christ imagine timing these swings
if you didn't buy NIO calls at 40.55, you truly are retarded
Eh, fair enough. It feels like this isn’t the first time I’ve seen it, but I’m not paying attention constantly or using any hard data to back it up, was just curious if it was a thing anyone else was noticing.
Imagine not buying this dip ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
PLTR take me back to green, I don’t like it here

I made $1400 on $OCGN calls by 8:44am today. Just bought back in the same calls for $500. Is this how the fed feels taking money all the time?
Omg, that amt would be a lot for me too! Glad you were able to recover (and then some 💪) in the long run!

I'm learning a lot as I go -- I don't normally do any fancy trading, just buying shares for the same reason you state - it is a safety net of sorts.

Thank you for the insight, I'll read up on ASTS (never heard of this one) and try to dedicate some time to read the stock charts better too, there are a ton of resources but it's hard to determine what is the more worthwhile read/strategy to adopt.

I want to understand your dreams for what they are, I also want you to understand we are in a living hell.
I pull out NVDA monthly chart and it feels great seeing I got in at the bottom! ... except I got in at that level in June and not October lol. Still up 25% in four months, not bad for my first stock purchase ever!
"I am inevitable."

Well yes at this moment, but I just mean in general. They really started taking off while SPY and QQQ were tanking. Things are recovering now, but at the same time these two stocks are also now starting to dip a bit. 

I know it’s probably recognition bias or whatever, but just curious if there’s anything to it.

Yahhh I am questioning my life choices. I sold calls outside my purchase price and bought $40 puts with the credit lol.

I can actually envision MSFT going down on earnings, because it went up quite a bit this year. Yikes
IINN is up 200%
Thoughts on AMD earnings?
GME paid for my kitchen, my car, my kids first year in college.  I love those fucking knuckleheads.  To the moon! Godspeed!
Deep down inside, they know it'll never be 200 again
Maybe in 2015, but now Google's machine learning is smarter than that.
I almost sold at the bottom but then I remembered where I am
Be honest. Who sold on that dip??
Already bounced hard off peak. Earnings on mega caps &amp; wealth tax info tonight. Could go either way.

Everybody hurry and pile into GME calls so I can dump my bags on you
People can still spread with all of them, particularly with the far more infectious delta, even though rate of transmission is greatly reduced (CDC says 5x, and &gt;10x reduction in hospitalization and death). mRNA vaccines are still the most effective. If you have info that proves otherwise, though, I'm genuinely interested in seeing it.
The Webull Dwac comments section is hilarious 😂 Made my day after being down today🍻Cheers DWAC’ers
Check out gavi.org for more info on it though
Bought some expensive xom calls a month ago, couldn’t timed it any better, everyday they just go up, at 30% returns, give me a gold star sticker mods

SPY up 

right now buddy

so idk
Can you get flagged for pdt on it?
Why is Gme going up ?
My guess is the DRS orders. 

Computer share lumps all orders in together and executes at the middle of the market day. This would be brokers buying shares on the open market to complete the transfer.

Okay serious question, why do GME and AMC appear to be inversely correlated with the broader indexes? Is there any data to support this is a real thing or is it just my perception?
It's okay bears, I'm sure when you predict the crash tomorrow it will for real happen this time

It’s a fun casino because it’s open 24/7
DWAC puts goin crazy
got a 60p on a whim, probably just throwing money away though.
Fucking TIGHT BUTH⭕️LE game slop
The hell is that? LOL
Puts starting to fade away on TSLA
I thought the apes liked commons? Either way, welcome aboard, and prepare for bankruptcy.
Hell yea GME, get your ass vertical
Retarded GME calls up 200% 🤤
SPY 458 EOD is so easy
Ocgn put
Up 50% on DKNG calls and probably just going to hold through earnings. Their growth outlook is going to be fucking massive.
Get ready for Gamestore. It was like last year. Spac, tesla, then memestocks. The OGs are coming back
TSLA gonna close green at 1040’s
GameStop was always the play
You’re fucking yourself. Hedgies have nothing to do with it.
Oh shit GME taking off a bit
$1k yolo play? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Who would you choose: young Asian girl or middle aged white and blonde milf???? SPY 460c 10/29
spy down gme 🚀… the apes will be the Michael Burry of the next crash
GME doing that thing it does.
Oh shit I have the waterpik one but I’ve had it for a while so I actually need to buy new one lol. They got a bit of competition but there’s definitely a market/ spot they can fit into! 😎 good to know
Buy the SPY dip is the easiest money 😎
Did you throw some Ford calls in the trunk?
FB 315s for Friday?
one last dip for amc around 32 before we see new wealth in our countries!
Buying gme calls less go

Just remember to take your Metamucil with you

Should of bought more gme
I hate to be an aPe but GME is exploding rn.
Riding it until the EOY and taking the win or the lose...after 12/31...I am out for the good or bad.
Only if their big dicks are what are weighing down those extremely heavy bags they are holding
You probably wonder about a lot of stupid things being that dumb
Goddamn theta... come on spy, let's go get ice cream.

I have slightly changed my mind. Everyone able to pronounce it correctly should adopt it.
They bought TSLA calls before the announcement and sold the rip
What are y’all’s price predictions on ATVI in the next few days
"crawling back"

"upswell"

If they lost money, how tf did they afford to pile back into GME? lol
will we see under 300 this week is the question
anyone here invested into ATVI?
Closer expiration means higher risk and lower premium. The small amount of extra potential returns does not usually offset the extra risk of a short expiration.
Because you haven't sucked enough dicks behind Wendy's for cash.
Because fuck you, that’s why
Because they announced wate flossers. Bullish af. Its like a pressure washer for your teeths

I'm going to regret not getting twitter puts, but i'm hanging tight to get amazon puts thurs before close.

Yes. They acquired Locals lolol
Guys real talk - IINN is taking off.
Corn gang, I bought some of your delicious roadside produce, and I don't get the appeal. Is there some kind of major price movement I'm waiting for? Because this is boring as a limp dick in a whorehouse.

Ive made all the wrong tsla moves.  Sold some of my stock last week, didnt buy calls right away when i was wrong, fomo'd into calls at ATH.  

Ramen tastes great though.
It’s what dreams are made of

Bullshit. Its never hitting 200 again man
It was the “thang thang” for me 😂
Just burn the money instead.
lol its not even close to earth. I want it to crash to 80 and then it can fly to 1000
That person is basing it off of the Hindutimes article
It will it will this is just scaring all the buyers tho it fuckin sucks
I understand and felt the exact same way as you in 2020. I also lost a ton of money (to me), almost 5K. 

But I've learned and adapted and stopped throwing money into random tickers spammed here and have managed to go up 9K on my all-time. I made up 13K to 14K and more importantly learned a thing or two about the market in general. 

The biggest and most important thing is learning to accept that some days, you will see losses. It is inevitable. However, by owning shares, you provide something of a security net for yourself whereas with options, you can and will nuke yourself straight to 0. I've done it many times.

You'll want to save up enough to buy at least 100 shares. Pick a company with growth potential but isn't overvalued. There are several good ones. Check out ASTS (I believe the subreddit is /r/ASTSpaceMobile) for a good example of a low cost, high potential ticker. I'm not telling you to invest in that ticker, just to see what I mean.
Buy FB when?
Yeah okay PLTR, back to 22 you go
r/DWAC has the funniest shit ever

&gt;The average liberal is on par with a poor college kid struggling to get by so they vote democrat in Hope's they'll get free shit. They are the epitome of paper hands, if they even invest at all. They sell once they have enough gains to buy a Chipotle burrito. 

CMG calls confirmed
What happened to AFRM?
mRNA went from $14 to 300 and they sold like 50 million

OCGN is about to sell 3 billion and it's at 10$. it's gonna hit like 1000 eventually

That's the case after their every quarterly earnings report
Yay to that . I consider myself as a boomer remover

Wired $30k into my investing account trying to buy puts on TSLA and it didn’t clear in time to catch the midday dump. Fuck.
I’m sure they will earn great, but I think all upside is pretty much priced in. 

maybe u see a 1-2% gain, but most likely I think you will see 1-2% loss
its coming papi. average down and wait.
it's good. saw it sunday
the evaporator
A third of Indians have this vaccine.  They cannot leave India at the moment because it's not recognized by WHO.  It's about 80% effective too.

When it gets approved, it'll be added to the list of 6.  

This is going to hit $50.
😂
A very stupid question. r/options is a better place to learn.
2nd that
Thanks for this! Just starting out and feeling like I'm v late to this party. Not being able to join in previous because of shitty jobs + rent increasing year over year.
That's one of the ones I was referring to, looks like momentum has fallen off and I'm going to pass on that one.

Yes sir!!!! If this keeps up it could be $200 plus by end of 2021

Wow FB still dumping
Come on TSLA. Come back to the green side
Saving some money to lose in AHs too
322 strike expiring friday
I'm sure that two and a half minutes won't put them under.
Please don't throw that kind of money on your first stupid option trade. Start with something small, jesus
GME can't be stopped!!!!!
Finally started making out-of-the-money call buys instead of just watching you all do it. Buckling up and fuckling down.
Oh fuck, forgot the HOOD was reporting tonight.

Better start drinking now.
I have calls as well. When do we find out anything? This ticker is all over the board today... over 200 million shares. Massive dumps, then climbs back up. I thought the news was supposed to drop today?
Considering the upcoming FOMC meeting and the inflationary woes, this is some of the frothiest froth
GME ain’t done yet. Bouncing off that previous 180 resistance to andromeda.
just wait for AH you haven’t seen SHIT
how far up? depends on the timeframe
this article is FAKE lol  it was deleted from Twitter
💵🔥
I am gonna wait for two or three red days in a row and then hammer weekly SPY calls.
This is getting overdone
Yes, and cheaper. Less extrinsic value.
I know it’s a scam because there’s nothing in my bank account
&gt; The big drop.
Manly as fuck, that one.
I don't know why it's mooning in the first place. They're trying to get emergency authorization from the WHO for yet *another* covid vaccine, which is almost assuredly going to be less effective than mRNA-based ones. Moderna has already moved on to developing mRNA vaccines for a variety of other diseases.
I don’t like this game anymore
&gt; I know. I'm just saying that you should have sold them when they were at $200
You'll have to be more specific.. WHICH big drop?
Nah, ive made so much money on Tesla i would never. Idc how profitable im holding my last shares to either 2T or 0 no inbetween idec anymore

Sounds like a shitty cop.
If you want to dig into details looks for companies that are less hedged - they'll reap better short term returns/results.
Christ on earth that five minute volume candle was nearly as big as the one at open.
Why can't Nasdaq ever have a normal green day
AMC too.. at the exact same time. Nothing to see here folks. Just crime
You must mean ODTE SPY calls right? If so, welcome. You’re in the right sub.
Better hope that hindustan news tweet was fake 🤯
Waiting for my VIX calls to print. There's been nothing better than getting them 2 months out, waiting for a 20+% spike, then flipping them for puts, riding those down, and doing it all over again.

Days like today when BABA dumps I imagine Jack Ma tripping and tumbling down a hill with his forehead rolling like a boulder.
First time buying a call option because why not. Stupid question. The closer the day, the higher the risk and the higher the return? Thinking a Tesla Oct 26 $1100
Attaboy! Now… stay with me here…. Imagine you take 1/3rd of that and buy a few puts!

Bought right before the dip. Now just waiting around to see what it's going to do next.
If you're being serious, do some research on smaller cap stocks

Find ones you like and companies you like

Invest in those and use that as something of a safety net for your portfolio 

Then either gamble your own money or a small amount of margin on calls/puts for fun but never too much on margin

Otherwise, just find smaller companies that aren't overvalued and do not straight up buy SPY until you see a dip, everyone is screeching about how it is well into overbought territory

Also, read. Read everything you can, everywhere you can. Go to some of the wsb spinoff subs and actually learn what you're doing

GME is so easy. Everytime it dips, it rips. Ive been going all-in everytime the stock plummets. Never ever bet against a stock with a cult behind it.
For real, potheads acting like all this research about weed being a safe drug is new.  The gov knows weed is safe and useful in medicine, but it would hurt big pharma pretty bad since they cant put a patent on bud. Big pharma lobbies the govt, weed never gets legalized, weed stocks never to the full potential.
Ol' penny-wise and dollar-dumb
Buy way higher than sell. It’s odd.

Oil has not fallen yet. That is why this market is so fucking stiff
Back to green we go!!
Guess I have no choice but to hold these TSLA calls a little longer than I should have.
Its because idiots are still buying TSLA. Once that falls it will go.

It worked at first, but then I didnt sell for profit. Just held and watched it bleed
That’s hot af
Spy rebounding and Tesla flat, that’s what I like to see
Bounced solidly off the 1010 range after almost a 10% drop off this morning. But let’s be real, talking out my ass is about as legit as TA crayon lines
For his pleasure
GME gang, gang 

Thang, thang
TSLA profits into GME calls. EZ money
VIX @ 16

i’ll be honest bulls, every time I’ve seen VIX up when SPY is also up, a very bad, no good time is to come
Look at spy go!  Unreal day
Any idea of when that announcement will be?
Gme doing the thing. Cue Leo points at screen 👉
Are you buying OCGN or waiting?
I would. So you should buy calls.

Literally the only thing that has made me money this week is the 200 puts I bought when I thought I bought calls.
I hope you covered the webcam at least
OCGN dropped due to fake news LOL  Confirmed that the Hindutimes article posted was from a fake account

Guys i think spy woke up from its nap
Yes I got my old flair back, fucking thank you god mods! to celebrate this, SPY 465 EOD
Yeah they're fucked.
/u/nosalute u put in your notice at work today?
hold.

I think we see $3500 soon barring some kind of terrible earnings (highly unlikely).
How will the supply chain issues affect oil companies? I got calls on XOM but crude oil doesn't seem like it's going down anytime soon so I don't know what to expect.
😭😭😭😭 if I have nothing to lose, how can I lose at all?!
I would not want to be on the sidelines for GME
Gme time 🚀
well they said the approval announcement will come today.. whenever that hits.. theyre literally gonna get 3 billion more sales per year
More 💪
🌈bear alert 🚨
when everything dumps but spy goes up more anyway
Used to do that shit in the morning while WFH. Feels good busting a nut on company time
460 by EOD
Retard lol
Bois literally I’m not kidding , one person said to the my pronouns is they/them
I am more of a macy gray moan
Pepper spray?  Meh, good for a laugh though
SPY historically goes up over time. It's a low risk, almost guaranteed small return on your investment.
As a Tesla bull, you’re right
not the right sub
my finger slipped and i accidentally bought fb callz hehe oops!
Guh

Market won't like that one.
\*click* \*click* \*click* ... \*click*
You didn’t know? When you buy a crap shell company at +1000% it’s totally a conspiracy when it goes down a couple of days later.
Why wouldn’t it, retail going wild and algos and the 1% need to lock their gains and dump it
We still got the power hour!

Shut up, buy Tesla FD's, and lose everything 

That is what we do

GME making a move
My dd is you’re truly gambling and you should pull it back. Don’t play with money you can’t lose, and if you’re putting money you’d like to grow in the market do so as an investor in a more stable, established stock.
I feel like GOOG is breaking 3k after earnings. I have weird stock split vibes
you want to go to r/investing. Here we gamble.
Fitting day for GME to hulk up.
I am one of them!
My prediction is that of big tech earnings, it'll be a bloodbath except for one +15% out of nowhere.

Don't ask me which one though, fuck that.

why is openai not investable
I'm 29 and finally have a small amount of $ to invest, maybe like $400-$500 every month. I see people buying SPY stock at ~$400 is it wise to enter in at this price point? How far up do these ETF stocks go? Is it reasonable to expect to see a nice return in a few years?
YELP, WEN, EAT, WMT, KSS, F, SWBI, TJX, PTON. Actually a lot of the BECKY index would be in there

Would be nice. Just a boomer stock taking its time to get to $20. I wish they would not do dividends in the future and instead buy shares back.
If you’re investing in AMD, then yes you are doing it right.
Lol 3%
Better than losing money, which is what I normally do.
FBI this post right here
I bought when it first dipped and never sold when it went back up. Was looking at a few K in profit and now I'm just holding a bag.
Massive fomo into NVDA in 3 2 1
Shit stock with no future. Maybe buy a few hundred shares when it's back under a dollar.
VZ = UP 0.8% today.  TSLA = DOWN 0.8% today.

Today's winners are yesterday's losers.

Is the volume buying volume or both buying and selling
Have you looked at the charts and indicators for TSLA? Or are you just talking?
It’s over for this week.  So many calls about to expire
AMD was my first option. LEAP calls when it was $4 a share. we been together through thick and thin, time to flex this huge growth dick on em 💪
We going down from here

Did you do it before or after the big drop?
All I need is JPow to mention rate hikes
Gme tryna show TSLA something
I hope it pays off for you
Fart on it?
Thoughts on shorting twitter before earnings (looking at whats happened to fb and snap after earnings) yay or nay?
Pelosi sold last year.

It got 5 upgrades and 12 downgrades, 20 unchanged.

It's dead money.
No because there’s a group of people that are retarded enough to think that buying every share they can will somehow result in the stock price going to $470 trillion / share

They'll probably say to each other "lol people were so dumb back then" before they go back to listening to their futuristic iteration of mumble rap

No TSLA tends to do things like that

Have a feeling Tesla will just bounce around between 1k and 1100 the rest of the week. Don’t think we’ll see 3 digit Tesla again without a split
Is GME fucking dead yet
FB dropped more than TWTR. Market is retarded rn
Dude, this is a fucking rollercoaster
You exited a short term play to jump into a stock that only went up because of the ticker you just exited? Brilliant!

They’ve done it like 5 times in the last year, so it’s certainly not beyond the pale
BAKKT is a good example. Been watching it all day. See if it will pick up where it left off.. volume double typical trading day.. and it’s dying good.
I been in tesla for a while now, sure seems like its done for now, some consolation is what we are most likely will see around 1040 pops and dumps around this treadline
I am once again advocating for the Copium emoji
I’ve learnt that after insane green days like yesterday, ALWAYS take profits the next day at or PM. Practiced that today and it actually worked and saved my ass!!
It Tuesday
masayoshi son probably made option whale bets on TSLA the past two weeks. I'd watch out to the downside.

Not falling for this again. Glad I sold CCs

I remember a month or two ago Dan Niles (some hedge fund guy) was on CNBC bragging about his fund being short TSLA and long FB, which were at $700 and $320 respectively at the time. I though it was the dumbest trade pair I've ever seen and I was hoping to see him come back but I guess he is too depressed to come back to talk about his losses.

Will OCGN spike after hours today? I kinda want to take a nap
Enjoy your bags
For once I didn't fomo into pump and dumps at 7am, and by 9:30 they were all dumped to hell.  Anything still pumping?
Su Bae will be on CNBC tomorrow morning ❤️❤️
Hope you took advantage of buying OCGN under $10 when you could. 😘😘
Ocgn is trash...there are only 2 vaccine stocks  with upcoming earnings moderna/ bntx
No
well google isnt a social media company that much compared to the two you mentioned. So it will be different
1100 tomorrow 1200 eow
Made a grand off OCGN in 20 minutes. Nice.
LFG!!
looks like an end of day drop is in the works. hope i'm wrong though
Yes
Example?
I love this friendly trade in shtf farce. More stuff to take with my ammo. If the pandemic didn't teach you that people aren't going to be nice there's nothing else to discuss here.

**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/Time_Kaleidoscope** bet **AMD** goes from **123.94** to **130.0** before **2021-10-28 13:55:51.221597-04:00** **

did i do this right?**
Over 1.5b market cap though.
I agree - but lots of heresay for some reason ruins its reputation. Amazon is the second least publicly “socially popular” and its also been stagnant for basically most of 2021
Long term holding, yes.
Gonna go see Dune tonight since the tickets are cheaper on Tuesdays.
Y'all in $BX, right?
its a common mistake but WSB is here to amplify it!
yeah, when it tanks to 14-15 again. Then ill load back up
You wouldn’t be surprised if Tesla ran 20% in a day?
pathetic volume
Wasn’t Tesla car manufacturer capacity being met year after year?  I thought the bottleneck wasn’t not having enough buyers, but how many cars they could produce. If that’s the case then why does 100,000 units affect the price so much when if not sold to Hertz they would have been sold to consumers?
!banbet AMD $130 2d

Ocgn will do a reversal back to $11 watch
I just bought IINN
AMD will crush earnings. TSLA is a dying world and the only way off it is in su bae's rocket ship 🚀
I'm not a bear, but how TF is the market still green with Biden fucking them economy up so hard? I've been cash gang for 2 months waiting.
It’s a gaint sink hole
I said that at their IPO back in 2012 lol. But I mean.. 600% or what ever it is over a decade almost isnt that impressive
well said so poetic
It's undervalued. Market is being stupid, I am buying at every dip.
I'm theta gang and OCGN is done. The play was two days ago
That is what you get for being greedy
Did the entire thread move from SPY into Tesla and Facebook?
No
np fam
Ocgn $10 10/28 calls?
Same 😫
Circuit breaker BS.
And prophylaxis for the HIV
OK I bought into OCGN.

...Someone explain what OCGN is real quick?
Went down
Done with what?
Entire market rotating into GLXY, unfortunately cannot explain what it is.
SPACs are no longer banned right?
Overextended af and at ATH
All the profits I made off DWAC have now been officially  erased by PHUN

PHUCK
Hood calls or puts? My brain says puts but my heart says calls
Valuations are so high, as soon as I buy it’s going down
So far only one source hindustan times saying who approval delayed/more info needed. Unlikely with 8.2M followers that they would risk a lawsuit with fake news. Expect chop through the rest of the day/tomorrow until news is proven false or true.
Tesla up 20% in 1 week (including current drawback), 55% 3months and 140% 1year

Long
Real question is can he handle the fukkk
why does shit like this never happen to my portfolio

oh wait don't answer that
Don’t
Shit you can buy dogs on there now? 45eow easy
well it is at a support level now at least, but that means we are fuk if it goes below 190. Also LMT (lockheed martin) tanked today after shiet earnings apperently. But BA isnt as involved in military as far as I could tell (13% of their income). 

And yes, im invested heavily into BA so I pray to the stockmarket gods that they decide to pump it after earnings
Damn sexy
Long Duck Zuck
Wouldn’t be surprised if TSLA hits $1,200 tomorrow
my 23andMe warrants are up 76%…whats going on?
The people who think this weeks TSLA run is over are wrong
Fundamentally yes but can you handle the ZUCC?
I'll miss you guys, unless MSFT can run up another 1.5% today I'm banned.
When it comes, it’ll come hard.
They don't rely on Apple products for a bulk of their revenue. They should be fine.
It “protects” traders 🙄 such bs
All of them
Fuck WHO. Fuck OCGN
This options are insane!
Pretty sure it’s TSLA’s fault.
It’s always a Judas.
Ooooffff fun isn't fun anymore
Is it just me or does nobody give a f-

Hey I know you! You’re that guy that I did this to last time
Poor Sophia
Nice distraction from losing your bet already.
Is FB done?  


I'm thinking this for a while now or are they  bouncing back just like Tesla did?  


The immense policital pressure from both parties and the rest of big tech doesn't look good on them
when ppl in the future ask why there are so much hatred against the machines, we only have to point back to our experiences with algos in the stock market
Defense stocks have been getting hit post withdrawal - Lockheed is down 12% today. Airlines have also had trouble rebounding because of spiking fuel costs, so they probably won't be in a rush to make orders. So far, the best bet I've made was GUSH; it's the only part of that entire supply chain I have that's heavy in the green.
Ahhh the Cathie Wood investing strategy lol

But yeah. LMT should be a good long term hold.
Fb is fundamentally the most undervalued mega cap tech stock. Considering selling my whole portfolio to go all in now.
He's just not retarded enough to think someone will give a fuck about platinum if society collapses to a barter system.
Yes
Alright. A grand worth of spy calls EOD
Because you touch yourself.
This
FB new name will be “&lt;300”
holy shit what happened to OCGN
Pleas
Crazy ass day. Up bigly at open to down bigly right now.
Snek pattern recovery continues
It was that bad
People like you are the reason I didn't go all in on Tesla at like $60. Always posting these irrelevant "facts" that doesn't matter to the stock price at all.
Dont worry the “news” was a repost of last week.  Webull finally removed the fake news.
FB will be +10% tomorrow probably. NFLX did the same shit where they plummeted after earnings then the next day they closed at prior ER closing price.
The volume on some of these stocks is insane. And the market is still in the gutter.
FB shares on sale!! Calls are decent buy rn as wel
Imma whagwan man
Bullets will be more useful in that situation.
Yet you still keep talking about it. 🙄
A Tesla split is happening alright. Bulls are getting split wide open
Jon and Pete Najarian: Yeah huge call option volume on these bad boys, we are gonna pick up these weekly FDs 

\*next day the stock is down 5%\* 

Good job guys
Lol a bunch of desperate “please don’t sell” posts. The mark of a good bagholding sub.
Hand over fist buy. Shares
move to Tesla
why my ban bet deleted
where the fuck was this comment yesterday
Is everyone still bullish on TSLA or not so much anymore

It's just getting good! High volume of option trading today. Looks like mostly $50p, but I'm sure the retards in here were buying the $80c.
Right here with ya
I'm still ambivalent on this issue. Rest Of Canada having adopted poutine as the national dish is annoying but on the other hand... Everyone should adopt poutine.
I did at 119....  obviously it kept dipping
So MSFT earnings are "baked in" at this price based on pure movement structure....but I think the earnings will be so immaculate it will force further price growth. 325c 11/5

Imagine not buying tons of FB at these prices now
I'm thinking of getting into some FB calls, maybe it'll start heading back to 340s. (Based on absolutely nothing other than feeling)
But what position?!?!?!
One step/dollar at a time, pal.

CSCO puts for ER. Save this and thank me later
Yeah he should try not being poor
I read from somewhere usually when a stock tanks before earnings, it will gap up 80% of the time
"If you DRS it, we'll be MOASSing by tomorrow" 🤡
I would love Jack Ma to just facefuck everyone with a 5% day tomorrow.
Only idiots like you would go that extreme... It's called diversification... I'm not saying go all in like a normal WSB ape...
Tesla usually does about 2x its prior high so that would mean the pump will end at about $1800
Yes, I completely agree. I’ve been thinking this, with rising 10yr and vix. And yet SPY keeps hitting ATH. So for now I’m thinking it holds through earnings/later in earnings then dump hard
I'll barter with my guns and violence, shiny metal ain't going to do shit unless it can fly out of a barrel if the shit really hits the fan.
Was way worse last spring and early summer.
We need rate hikes to get back to that level
Link buddy
Ya think? Cult kids have had 10 months to learn how to look up 5m worth of stock data and still don’t even know what the words they’re using mean.

It's 2040. PLTR has used its blackbox technologies combined with access to government data collecting to exert influence in worldwide events.

🐻 Jesus isn't real bro.  It's just a meme I hype here when I go🌈 and are holding puts.  Pray to JPow if anything, he's a real god.
You have to have a very high IQ to trade AMD so I don't mess with it
If we are in a world when stocks are zero and you need to be holding physical platinum could I recommend you invest in cyanide pills instead ?
Bro gotta lay off the adderall
It’s crazy how every single meme stock every single day always has someone assuring everyone “there’s no shares left to borrow” and then the next day they once again blame the shorts but assure everyone there’s “no shares left to borrow”

It seems pretty clear they are reading that data wrong

Try tech sales. All the same salary + benefits and then x5 that entire sum in commissions alone (if u don’t suck)
I realized all stocks are pump and dumps to some degree. It oscillates higher or lower depending on next financials.

This is the last time to stock up on TSLA while it's above $1000. Get them bags ready.

That's because everyone is taking out loans to invest in the stock market. I've heard of people being underwater on their home with multiple mortgages just to have as much as possible in the market.

You'd be getting nearly even money at that point. That value doesn't exist anywhere in the market right now, at least not anywhere anyone would want to go long.
That feeling when a 3X leveraged ETF is less volatile than TSLA 🤡🤡
 I went from +1.35% to -0.72% :(
i've got a bunch of google shares too so i'm trying to hedge, not get rich. but i firmly believe qqq going down big time after amzn aapl report.

New TSLA shorts about to get demolished and feed the rocket
My problem is on Monday I spent my entire account to buy a single 980C before the massive surge (yes I understand, it’s interesting to frame this as a “problem” because it was very lucky timing on my part), but I feared that I wouldn’t be able to take some profits off the table since I was all in one contract. I like to have two contracts and sell one and let the other one ride closer to exp. I have the opportunity to get out of one contract now with this setup. Hoping I don’t duck this up, but at the end of the day there is a big luck factor, this is all a gamble.

Fair point on the IV. I'd be hesitant to buy even at half its current price, but obviously market says I'm wrong af and it's made me leave a lot of gains on the table, so godspeed.

Please to those who made bread on tesla puts. How much you made so far?
I'm so glad I slept in so I didn't fall for OCGN's bullshit again
11am down 8k.
1:30pm down 7.5k.

keep it going by 2029 i will be whole.
I’m not selling…. Cuz I can’t cuz pdt
Why not just buy shares with the gains and not have to pay the insane IV premiums, lose via theta decay, and risk all the gains?
$50M mkt cap… get out of here.

Ouch dude I’ve made a good return collecting premiums on that one. It’s been winner from that lens 💯
Prog is going to rip. SI is so high!
I’m kind of digging these halts maybe get the ball rolling in the right direction lfg!
Serious question, on Level 2 data, in TOS in regards to TSLA, I keep seeing the CHEX with 100  on both side of the BID/ASK at different price points.  I know each order is x100 but all the other bid/asks are 1 maybe 2 with an occasional other number depending on the order volume.  The CHEX 100 has been there the whole time and just keeps lowing the price down.
You've been MUSKED

This is the best day I've had with my small starting amount.  I saw people talking about how insane market open was and just bought puts on everything.
Just let SPY die you fucking retards
Hell of a dump there.   Some bad news come in?
Today was the first time I vomited looking at my trades. Good times.
Short attack on OCGN, WE CLOSE!
Is it going to be power hour or sour hour for tsla?

U heard it here first folks. FB may or may not go green eod
#FB DWAC BOYS DED
Looks like its pulling back
Why dk?
i did a 8000 bet for AMD earnings. Im either going to cry or be happy
I can't find the link, but...

A while ago, in one of the Daily Discussion threads, some dude talked about $PROG going to $5. And then, in a horrible twist of fate, it *immediately* tanked to ~$1.30, and everyone ripped on him. Like... he was talking about it, and *while he was posting* they sold a ton of stock and it dropped like a rock.

Because of that guy I started following $PROG, eventually bought some, and sold it today at $4.15. So whoever that random dude I took terrible financial advice from was, you're *awesome.*
Into the grave
If we stay above 455.58 today by close then by next week will hit 469
ok thanks. i gotta wait for some expirations anyway
I think you broke it, kindly revert
OCGN stalls out again…. WTH
You just had the highlight of your trading career. Screenshot it, print it, hang on wall.
As is tradition, when WSB goes all in it's time to walk away.
AMD just broke out today's descending channel. Looking for a rip before earnings
Same, but I’m just watching stocks instead of doing my actual job.
Tf is this market today
[deleted]
It’s going up
TIL $SHOP moves with $FB
Tesla gonna moon shot the last hour of trading
infrastructure bill will pass today, this dip is way too suspect.
That's awesome if consistent
[deleted]
I don’t hold any FB so it doesn’t matter to me, but LOL at the FB bulls who were laughing at FB bears yesterday market AH
That guys big post yesterday about giving up on shorting TSLA was just the bear flag I’ve been waiting for
Had tsla $1100 weeklies but slept thru that big gain today…..now i am holding the bag. Elon tweet something!!
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Are electronic payments just dead then?  Ok.
Not one we would miss, for sure.
1100 - sell - 1000 - panic sell - 900 - buy
guess all that morning WSB euphoria was an indicator of sort
Long term prospects of treason.....
I hope so.., i am bleeding as I bought ATH
Maybe selling my calls to secure some gains and buying slightly longer dated slightly more otm calls at the exact same time was not the best move. In the future I think I'll sell to lock in gains, then just wait like 20 minutes and see how I feel.
Anyone buying calls on fb? What’s your position?
SPY setting those higher highs and lower lows, it’s going up boys
Net and TSLA puts exp Dec.  I predict massive profit taking
58 by close today??
Calls on power hour hitting $459
Yeah, I’m gonna hold on and pray!
Legoooo
CLOVtards never had a chance
I bought the shit out of DKNG. They already turned a take over offer because everyone knows it's a  🚀🚀🚀🚀
Guh
Wtf happened to Facebook
why would it dip
The spy hit a new all-time high today regard 

Shit ain’t tanking buy your puts go broke
I feel like a dirty little beaver scalping 10% gains each week.
I must not sell

selling is the profile killer.
#WE PUMPING
I bet AMD hits 129 before close tomorrow
Pump and dump and pump and dump and….
60 mil vol on the uptrend IINN.
Did JPow just raise the interest rate to 10%?
No it’s because of options/gamma but that was the catalyst
OCGN: because we need yet another less effective covid19 vaccine that antivaxxers will still refuse to take.
i dont have a target. but i know for sure buying calls right now will have me fucked by theta/bad sentiment so i'm gonna wait until storm's calmed down a bit.
GODDAMN you're much richer than me
Facebook money.. you can find a new home in Nvidia 📈📈📈
Imagine mangostock goes back to IPO price and never goes back up again. how many apes would be trapped O\_O

But it signals the world is ready for evs lol

TSLA heading back to 900 🤔
OCGN managed to wipe out all my spy call and put gains for the day.  I was feeling real good for a while there.
it was me? Looks like it was approved due to posts in r/Ocugen
Jet fuel can’t melt NUE steel beams.
I chose poorly
I missed out on tsla but IINN is in it today 🥵🥵🥵
[deleted]
no idea. In my mind facebook fell for no reason (i know the "reasons" so don't lecture me on that), so it could very well pump for something dumb like this.
Its earnings were terrible. I'd expect the dip to last at least a short while.
you win some, you lose a lot.
Market is tanking because of the tax on unrealized capital gains. Tech billionaires will be forced to sell off their stock in droves to pay it leading to massive downward pressure.
That good ol’ hours
AMD put printed finally. But TSLA call has tanked - frick
Do the opposite of your intuition, be like George Costanza
SQQQ calls printing today. When all the tech ERs blow up simultaneously tonight, it's gonna be spectacular.
I’m not complaining lol
shit, wow.  you got me.
Love me some Joplin 👌🏼
If you believe that’s why it popped you are fooled.
With DDR5 right around the corner and CRSR at an almost 52 weeks low I might just go full retard on it. Please convince me otherwise
OCGN I love it, suck my balls, ill sell when I’m happy with the price $15+
Not until it’s $1,420

Those TSLA weeklies are gonna go from 10,000 to worthless by tomorrow
Any reason AMD fell off ?
OCGN This happened.    https://twitter.com/httweets/status/1453045901845405700?s=21
looks like it did
May the odds be in our favor.
Doubled down on FB calls. Where thou dip buyers?
I wish you luck! Hopefully we see a pop!
You were supposed to say something like “da fuq

lucky gas then. literally bought the top on FD puts and then sold the bottom. I'll buy in again end of day.....was intending it to be a hedge but might also be some extra $$$
This has probably been said already but TSLA reaching $1T market cap from a $4 billion order for a bankrupted company is absolutely fucking hilarious and sounds like something written in some stock market bubble movie
Just wait til they pick up the phrase “short squeeze” bad combination right there
You buying more on this spy dip or waiting for eod?
I'd wait to see if 1k holds
Are we having fun yet
wait 3 days.  In theory it should bounce on the 200dma
Is there and truck that i could run on wti light crude? I mean $86 for 42 gallons isnt that bad.
Rip OCGN  


Never trust the WHO
not buying until friday fuck this noise

Share price tanking/trading sideways but call options getting more expensive, GL with earnings lol

Everyone

Tendies

XXX
Dam look at what they did to our boy tsla
Fuck you, ass onion.
It's the best thing ever because it prevents people from putting their worthless price predictions in the daily without consequences. If you get the banbet right you've earned the chance to say I fucking told you so.
I warned traders not to have high hopes for OCGN esp when you have a CEO who spews BS about EU approval.  OCGN is getting sued for fraud for announcing false info about the approval process, etc to prospective investors.
Approval flopped again, this time with WHO
The day i thought i could turn off my second monitor OCGN goes fucking retarded. Bitches better accept coupons for a blowjob.
OCGN is just a pump and dump at this point.
The absolute state of Mango bag holders right now
What are you guys’ thoughts about FB’s name change on Thursday? We all know it will be retarded but what are your predictions for the stock?
I’m down $8,000 today and I’m not worried
Suit yourself, but when the rest of us are out gettin our yachts winterized you'll be singin a different tune
Ok fiiiiiiiine this is the Corsair bottom
Yes, but the company already has nearly $1B in revenue a year with 80+% projected growth per annum over the next five years. It's obviously not a $20 stock haha.

It was a pretty great day if you sold before lunch.
Confident with name change in Thursday?
Ban. You get a flair of your win/loss ratio and more is coming. Fucking retard get out of this fucking sub I'm tired of your shit
Can’t wait for the OCGN loss porn

ya i'm debating buying in now or waiting until next earnings..... i think I'll wait until other big boys report, if they go down hard they'll drag down FB even further.

10 percent on TSLA puts holding for 1000 percent
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrroken
Intra-day pump &amp; dump!
Vol.  up.   Got to be IINN it to win it.
According to Webull and Stocktwits, the answer is short attacks.

They forget the whole 'WHO asked for more information and will reconvene next month' news that just dropped.
Did OCGN vaccine 💉 get denied ?!?! WTH happened
So, what are the odds VIX hits 18.40 so I can break even on my stupid Calls?  🤣😂
its probably just gas
Why is ocgn even dropping? Shakeout before vax approval?
Dip bought

This is the BABA dip I waited two weeks for. Please let this be a bottom
PUTS on TSLA
Delayed again. Who ever the WHO insider was is a lying bastard.
Where?
What’s your buy-in price target? Or are you waiting for an upside catalyst?
that's strange, because there were at least 5 people in the evening Dune showing I went to last night. 

I would think 10% theatre capacity for a blockbuster would be enough to push this stock higher
IV crushed once? shame on you

Fucking BIGots
that's cuz they know that "short ppl got, no reason to liiiiiiiive"
Scooped up FB on the Friday dip and more on today's dip. Let's see how it plays out. As much as i hate the company they absolutely rake in cash
Good time for wish
I love how main st media will blame WSB's for TSLA run up, but we're not the ones that bid this up and aggressively tanked it. We're the scape goats for the hedgies.
Draft kings slowly reversing gains on news of not acquiring a better gambling company in a partnership with also a better gambling company. 

Furthermore making people question why management openly discussed making an acquisition with stock which was valued greater than draftkings entire market cap.

Totally normal and not a meme stonk clown show
Did you get Eloned today?
BAN
They’re scared of OCGN, buy this dip !
Back up we go
Earnings probably
Well it was a $20 IPO in December
Anyone else kinda think of stocks as alive? Like they have personalities and when they gain/lose the little duders are doing it intentionally. Maybe like some kind of Miyazaki creature or something?
Clifffff
[deleted]
pretty sure we're going to hell once earnings are over.
Marisa Tomei 😍
Down another 30% tomorrow
Holy shit who killed OCGN?
AVPT releases earnings next week
They’re still Microsoft’s largest partner
So ban bets are like buying OTM options, but if they don't hit you can't post here and if they do hit you... get nothing?  Is that correct? 🤡

Gotta admit. SPY bulls are fucking relentless. Every dip gets bought
From moon to abyss…
If you thought OCGN was gettin approved for anything your high on that hopium
Yeah but you can winterize more than one boat at a time. But given that there probably is no company in the world with enough resources to winterize 183 massive yachts in 2 days, he'd have to start his own company:  *Elon Musk's Yacht Winterizing Emporium* 

He could then list his new company under ticker $EMYWE, generate billions in market cap and hire tons of yacht winterizing laborers to get all his yachts winterized in 2 days while simultaneously creating tons of billionaires out of EMYWE early investors which then go on to buy yachts. And who better to winterize all those yachts than Elon Musk's Yacht Winterizing Emporium!? Literally can't go tits up.
Buy VIAC dip before blowout earnings

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/tooclutchh (0/1) made a bet that SPCE would go to 18.0 when it was 19.585 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Looks that way to me too

Must be nice to sell the news twice. OCGN

Yup crazy ass roller coaster ride.
WHO seeks further clarification on OCGN. Yuh oh
Is Facebook a falling knife now, or a great buy-in opportunity? No past or current $fb positions.
NK could nuke the US and I’d be happy as long as it stops the bul
I sold my 5 shares. But for real talk DIS PE right now is insane. It is not the next TSLA and valuation will go down. I'd get out.
If Tesla could get to like $1200 by end of day, that would be pretty neat
Incase there is anyone at all left out there that doesn't know... Tilray is still garbage

I buy, it goes down, I sell, it goes up. Am I buying puts?
aoc feet are busted
All the stocks I felt uncomfortable buying ended up dropping. I'm a fortune teller. Or a pussy. Either way I kept today's modest gains.
Keep it up 👍. You are doing great
It's about to get bloody
[deleted]
Yeah but you're not unique
What a week the last two days have been
&gt; I want to sell every pop and short every bounce.
Who bought Tesla at the top? Show yourself.
Completely shit the bed on earnings
Sold a few puts.  Option quotes are wild.
yeah, but even with +/-10% off top bottom call / puts, day traders did well
Real men create their own luck
Taking the next 3 hours off and coming back for the litty AH earnings calls. Let’s goooooo ✌️

I would like to know also😅 I’ve been averaging down every hour today
I don't feel like reading shitty articles, why is the entain and DKNG deal falling through bullish for DKNG? Is entain not good or is it just bullish in the sense that DKNG has more free capital to invest into itself?
OCGN dumping
for the next 20 years?
Any update on the guy who bought like 5 million in spy calls betting it was going to rally rest of the year?

I guess, pretty big correction. Damn.

Easy to say that in hindsight
Bid dick energy. Hope we both get the tendies
If $SPY doesn’t V shape recover, it’s game over, demand has to be there for it to continue to move up.
I lose money every trade
Which one of you retards bought calls when it was at 1,070 looool
13 pro or 13 pro max
Lol.  SPY is +0.13%
well on the bright side, i significantly lowered my taxes for the year today
Scooped em
prog consolidating… could pop this afternoon
Why does OCGN just keep dumping so hard
I want to see it passed. Anything to kill this market
If dwac goes back up to 175, than I dye my hair orange...

You were wilding at 5
I'm not a simp!
TSLA 1000 tested successfully 👍🏽

So glad I closed all my positions and took gainz to GME shares today.

Coolin
Unrealized gains are a bitch a rooney dooney.
HAHA you wish. Right now, tesla is outside of the Bollinger Bands on the charts. You will be lucky if 950 is a strong support in the coming weeks.
Weekly 130c here
150C weekly. 100 of those bad boys
This
I rlly want to do 990 1w but I feel that would be pushing my luck
Can I please have my FB money back plz?
Damn Tesla was really at 2? Fml. Well no sense in selling now
Giving us disappointment, as is its nature
Somebody play hood calls with me.

/u/ChefB22 (4/0) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1010.0 when it was 1048.81 and it did, congrats autist.
I just realized how shorted PROG is, it has 67% SI!! With the 300% movement over the past month, it’s going to rip so hard this week
Apparently a false filing stating they sold shares
Damn that feeling when you are deep in the pits of despair flipping to euphoria when you see TSLA gave back all its gains and your puts are printing
I don’t , when shits mooning I usually buy shit that hasn’t gone up too much or that’s just steady which might be even more retarted
Stop buying puts after it's already cratered
Why is everything rek
458
SPY 461C exp tomorrow $9 a pop, get em while they are hot
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)T ENOUGH
why wait until the bottom to buy puts?
Threw more money at QCOM calls.  Feels like it will join the rally at some point
Why does anyone buy baba?
I fomo’d on the dip. Made the gains back
Just sell a call against it and reduce your delta risk  if you are worried.

Corsair septuple bottom!!! 📈📈📈🚀
I have been waiting
So is SPY ending the day red or WHAT guys
Shorts haven’t covered on OCGN they’ve doubled down with 1,000,000 shorted this morning. Hold or add and there will be some massive covering regardless of approval
It would be good for the country long term. Our infrastructure has gone to shit in the last 40 years because nobody has spent any real money on maintaining and upkeep
AMD or MSFT ????????
Bulls will ignore the VIX then wonder why their investments disappeared
Mandatory paid parental leave alone would be life changing for so many people. Plus addressing climate crisis is paramount
Over 50% of float in november option chains in prog, over 70% of those calls already ITM, the closer we get to november 19th the more insane this will get.
After the earnings after the bell today and before the bell tomorrow SPY is going to fly like an eagle
WTF with AMD?
Every time PLTR goes above the 22-25 range, Nasdaq crashes.
It'll probably be higher in 10 years but probably not in 1 year.

Did FB already finish their stock buyback program? Lol
Are people buying TSLA at this price just for a short term trade or are they thinking this is a great entry, gonna be way higher 10 years from now?
TSLA is holding up the entire market right now. Once that bubble pops and it will watch out!
Weed is going to be federally legalized in the next few years.  Really need Tilray to start acting like it.

Scale out a bit at least.
I can't believe all the people who made money on Tesla are opting for a lambo. The least you could do is become loyal to the brand.
Is there anyone whose actually passionate about BBB passing? The dems keep saying they have to pass this or else, but idk anyone who actually cares about it

I can’t believe the Fed presidents who made millions on insider information during the pandemic were not forced to pay it back, went to jail, etc. instead, they were able to resign and effectively retire early and not have to worry about money ever again.

We have angered the economy
So we're not worried about the VIX right?

So… what actually happened?

TSLA never going below $1,000 again.
Nah
UPST seemed low enough, just bought
Phew that was close. Strong support at 1,000$ 😎
Look how they slightly dented my boy.

it didn't miss by 5% either, it missed by about 1%
thats me every fucking day, i believe in the manopause.
any win is welcome
If your only indicator is hope, close...you can always re-enter.
I got the nov 3rd 460’s LFG
Everything is priced in, everything is overvalued.
Boeing is so lucky that they can blame supply chain issues instead of just admitting they’re an incompetent company run by morons lol
I hope so I’m holding for a few months now cause I thought it was really undervalued along with American Airlines and the good and bad days seem to just even out, spy is pulling the weight and minimizing my loses as per usual lol
Diamond hands boys, TSLA still hitting 1100 EOW
Hmmmm
Happy Tuesday to everyone except DWAC bagholders
Earnings should be pretty good, it's being kept pretty stable rn so it's a little unnerving
Why NVDA is pumping
Sorry but have to hit you with

Don’t buy this dip for $SPY, only going to drop more later this week, unless you’re day trading!

Or retarded.  Sold my TSLA calls earlier this morning.
Spy itching to hit $460. Lets go bby pls
Got some TSLA calls for mid december, 1100C. 

Sell them and take the 30% I've made so far this week, or hold?
Why SPYyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy????
Uhhh wtf just happened to $MP
Fi fity
Enterprise should pick up my tsla calls like it hertz
Is this what being a bagholder feels like???
stock split eow
Red Lobster here for duty
not really. it's way cheaper than the other tech majors, and it's only up 12% YOY. Earnings is a crazy game that makes no sense, the only reasonable explanation is it has nothing to do with performance, and is just a way for MMS to rake in the dumb money
I should have listened to my friend when he said let's go all in 10/29 1000 Tesla calls last week. Now he's deciding what color Lambo to buy while I'm still stuck in my mom's basement. Worst feeling ever.
Puts on bears at open
Keep in mind the Dems want to crash the market now so in 1 year we will be mid bull market for mid terms. Nancy has been getting some puts👀
Would’ve been good at 10:30 now I’m not so sure.
What do you see
Loaded on 457 calls at what looked like the bottom. Let's ride
Insiders want market low so they can buy at lowest possible price before earnings. Buy SPY call 1 dte they will print
Who knows if there will even be a report!? Supply chain issues may cause them to cancel.
For over a year?
Does webull allow you to sell 1 strike higher or lower for profit? It keeps saying not enough buying power
Tsla 3 bar play on daily = $1100 tomorrow
BOUGHT THE DIP
If you want an easy way to triple your money buy some  nov 5 spy 460 calls
Lol investors were as disappointed by the PINS PYPL merger as they were with cancelling it
It means you are absolutely stupid to think TSLA will go to 1500$ eow 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Finally Tesla is going down, was feeling awful about selling my 300 shares @ 1020 yesterday lol , hoping for 850 to buy back!
You’d be braindead to not think we closing at 460 by Friday
1150

Only if the "d" stands for "decade".
if your not buying this dip you aint white

This is what my brain is telling me is true but fuck. I already missed out on a great entry now that SPY is down $2 fuckin dollars in the last hour and I’m worried we pump again tomorrow or something. Been on a big losing streak lately so I’m super cautious about entry points. Ugh. Might just keep watching and buy some if we bounce back up a bit..

correction imo, it will bounces back soon
VIX officially mooning
Yup could of made an extra $200

Cathie rebalanced
I almost slammed the buy button. I decided if I do that it will drill some more. Because I didn’t, it’ll recover to new ATH today. You’re welcome.

It’s a good long hold imo, but it moves a lot so I’d wait til it’s back in $21-23 territory
Oil stronk.
Sell for 50% loss or keep holding 🤔. Shit is just bleeding
TDA is superior so not really. No broker will allow you to open a margin account or trade options unless your application indicates several thousand in liquid net worth and a few years of options trading. You can reapply for options or margin at any time on either.

F
Tesla basically opened the flood gate.
Always better too soon than too late. Congrats!
How the fuck did i go from deep green in the morning to getting margin call a few hours later
Enough of the big players noticed too much bullishness in the options chain - fucking cranked it and left several holding the bag. For newer traders, the general rule is on the 3rd-4th day of straight outrageous pumping, it’ll correct. 

One way to recover your major losses on TSLA 10/29 1200C’s is to suck some fat ones behind Wendy’s?
And all would stay and play
Legit giving away shares today
looking ghastly 


what is even propping SPY green?
Puts making bank on a day like this
Bought puts yesterday
SPY will recover today.
I went from down $8k to up $45k. thanks spy puts
Yeah I don't normally like to sell shares at a loss... But dumping PINS is tempting. But Im not going to because literally the microsecond after I sell it will start to rise, so fuck you PINS.
SPY bout to rip in the power hours.

Edit: Holy shit I was just fucking around but look like it's happening.
Yo check this shit (falls on my ass)
Ima just close the app and open it back tomorrow.
FB bout to close even
Hope you’re right! I have SPY and AMD calls!

Bounce for me daddy

I hold $PINS.
Bought spy puts pretty close to the top, and day trade locked so holding overnight.
Why do people buy options with no day trades left?
I blame $FB for this!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬
[deleted]
Yep, totally agree with you. I normally only trade when it's upgrades or downgrades across the board. I normally wait a day after earnings too. Things are way too wild for me.
Seeing my random SPY puts go from near worthless to back up feels nice…I’m feeling a little 🐻ish
Bought  March otm $315 calls on Facebook. How are my prospects looking?
Jesus how am I so good at buying the top? This is literally my 5th time this year buying before a pullback , wtf is wrong with me

I thought it's already out

Only OCGN can save your portfolio now
Good thing I got nov 3rd and nov 5th spy 460c’s - I am almost certain spy will rebound bigly by then 

Would be way too nervous if they were 10/29 460c’s even tho those will still probably print
I feel a great disturbance in tendieland.. as if a million apes suddenly cried out as their calls went to zero
JEROME DID YOUR ALARM CLOCK BREAK SEND HELP
Yeah they lost 60% of their revenue since December.. according to their stock price. That’s nuts
At least I have a phone interview tomorrow 😕
good keep holding until $200
If TSLA drills I hope burry was just joking about exiting his short position. 
But on the other hand that would funny as fuck if he actually did.

Really regretting holding onto those BA calls as long as I did before rolling into a spy puts.
I mean you had to have known it would slightly correct.
Pls go back up, this is not the day to end red
Saw more upgrades than downgrades so idk. I’m pretty surprised. I thought it would trade flat or slightly down until like tomorrow but the overall market looks pretty weak on this pullback.
OCGN, HOOD, JOBY in that order all about to blow up
shouldnt you be posting this garbage on WeBull?
I was up and then I was down
I wanna know as well!

The remaining fed sold today 😂. News of more feds retiring in 2 weeks
The FB dump seems strange. Their P/E now is like 20 with annual revenue growth of 35%! And that’s compared to peak pandemic levels. A no brainer at this price IMHO. Probably some algos got triggered

I’m not sure they hire fat people
PROG is running, it could rip to $6 this week. Everyone buying into that green stock today
[deleted]
Lol at the guy on the front page who boasted his Tesla calls and said he wasn’t selling until Tesla hit $1100 🤡
So what do I do about holding $PINS? $ROPE?
[deleted]
Calls or puts for earnings?
Was up a good amount on shares.. just all faded to flat
TSLA under $1k by EOD?
Whats the cause though? Just a shit ton of selling?
Looks like double top tbh
Another buyback pls.
Welp, time to drink
PROG is my only green of today..LOL
( *laughs in Tim Apple* )
Didn’t sell my tesla calls when I was up do we dump them for loss or hold
FUCK YOU UPST PILE OF TRASH. 9% DROP IN 2 HOURS HOW THE FLYING FUCK
Ah yes, of course. We’ve done nothing but go up for 10 days straight, and the second I flip my puts into calls we go into a correction. Fuck this fucking market.
WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON!?!??
OCGN about to skyrocket to 100 once it gets approval. for reminder, mRNA went from similar price to 300 when it got approval, and OCGN has literally not even lying, 30x more production capability = 30x more profits
WTF SOFI falling off a cliff
Sounds like PLTR
I was getting downvoted to oblivion for trash talking FB the last few days 🤣😂
fuck it. prog it is
Wow how many got roped into those TSLA calls
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Do they still throw confetti
[deleted]
There are two kinds of people. People who bought TSLA during the rip. And people who bought FB during the dip. I’m the latter and I’m fucking stupid
haha Tesla went red after that run. Beautiful. This market is something else.
Am I still banned guys? I was just a few days early on SQ to 270…

Holy shit, spy 100 dma eow
[deleted]
Depends on when u went in I am +900%
One day some fat fuck employee from TSLA comes out as the so called whistle blower and talks about ethics and stuff. I can already feel it.
Or open at 460 tomorrow. MSFT AMD GOOG are all going to smack expected earnings.
Think I just heard the loudest collective GUH on Tesla hitting red
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
anyone holding their tsla 10/29 calls through or are u selling
Nothing but silence here...  look like she's going to 1k
The S&amp;P for the last two weeks was moving around 80 cents a day. The one correction it had it dropped $1 now it's below $2 from where it started at ATH. This is a travesty
Same. Going +5% to basically flat in a matter of a few hours across the total portfolio. Crazy to think how many boomers circle jerk about making 8% in an entire year lol
Sold sklz made 2k
I'm literally not black
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Sometimes a class can be missed for thousands of dollars
Facebook ruined the entire market. Even Tesla
Today turned into a big yikes
Best barber in the world couldn't match today's fade. Damn this is cruel.
but you do
Wrong. Wait till the MM’s come back from their lobster lunch. SPY finishes green today. Bet.
Am I early to the gay bear party???
haha gunna break even on these tesla puts soon thank god for iv that shit saved me these past two days 😂
AMC just hit the bottom,  buy signal for swing and day trades
And here comes the emotional sell off… 💀
Why is SPY goin' red! Too frothy?
At least wait for it to fill that gap in 900's
FOCUS on PROG. Simple.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Dump the market all you want but you leave Sophie out of this
#Oh yes, fuck me Daddy!
Trading this TSLA volatility is really getting my pp going.
Red hole?
Because I wanna see that 2.5 cost basis when I exercise it and those beautiful green % gains. 

Spread wasn’t too large, cost nearly the same as buying 100 shares, risking less a little less than owning the shares
Guh
Who do I contact for a refund on tsla calls?
HAHA YASS BUL IN SHAMBLES ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)

BEAR MARKET COMMETH ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Imagine not getting showered with tendies from daddy Jensen
Lol the fuck just happened??
greed kills
I still need SPY to go down $10 more damn dollars by tomorrow to save my $445 puts I bought last Friday
Man I sure would hate to be bagholding TSLA at a $1000+ cost basis.
lol my just for fun 1275c is melted, oh well.
RIDE is up!
My 3.5 in her too
Is it just me? Or is this market in a full sell mode right now? Cause it feels like a ton of selling. 

Was hot this morning.
Here we go again
Yea, should have
im asian tho
Practically everything is dropping at the same time
MOH breaks through $300 to new high. Earnings tomorrow. 💵💵💵
AMD put is printing
Zero sympathy for TSLA bagholders, you either got in late or are just a greedy fuck 😂
This day is wild as fuk
Lunch time is over, turn it around SPY
Should of waited for premium to get cheaper. \~2.25 rn
Really? It was $6.47 ?
Imagine not selling the ATH.
SPY will finish green today.
Can’t believe y’all honestly didn’t see a pullback coming. That 6-8 day run was insane and nothing really warranted it. Taper coming too.
Please post loss porn I’m having a bad day
Not bad, only need 150% gain in 2 weeks to break even on those calls. IV is 250%, what’s not to love?
Corsair is plummeting for the 300th day in a row, insane
PROG⬆️. TSLA ⬇️. 😵‍💫
If you don't buy that $TSLA dip you ain't black
I don’t feel good thinking about all the calls bought this morning. I don’t enjoy people losing money no matter who they are.

That being said, my negative portfolio holding just a handful of SPY puts is ok with this movement
Tesla puts printing now.  Thank god I doubled down at 1080 to dig myself out.  I was one leg up away from the cardboard box
Elon giveth and Elon taketh
Lol my PLTR 26c about to go red
Green Strike is over I guess!
I went from being up 11k to -2k 

Fml
I don’t think I have ever had a bigger swing in my portfolio than today. JFC just shoot me.
most of the money i've ever lost is from wanting to multiply a big win. when i lock in 100% gains or more i straight up delete the app to protect it from my own greed lol
Its crowded behind wendys
Tesla rips, Tesla dips.
Is this market reaction to Yellen?
My entire portfolio consist of TSLA puts and they were all calls earlier
Lmfao literally every time I sell  for a reasonable profit like a sensible person, it keeps going greener.  When I hold it turns into a black hole
Facebook more like trashbook
$300 is the new support.
Missed out on selling tesla calls up 100% because of classes. Moral of the story, work at Wendy’s and don’t go to college.
I imagine people who bought 150+ still remember
UVXY fucking thanks bro
ONON 21% ROI 🤤
Tsla giveth n taketh
My account went from 5k yesterday at close to 12.5k at 10:45 to 6.7k right now. Wtf happened with this dump?
Fuckin Fox and the Hound right in to that bear trap
fintech down bigly today. thinking of buying calls EOD for next week
lmao,puts paying off big time
[deleted]
I’ll join you
Fb giving away 5 months of gains in a few weeks lol
Who bought the tippy top of TSLA today show yourself.
DWAC 150c 11/19 - 7k loss
It’s 12 bro
I’m not really good at this options thing
Course right when i buy calls fuck you SPY
Tesla daily screaming correction
Damnit
That’s what the boys all tell me when they meet me behind the Wendy’s dumpster.
Bear time motherfuckers
I almost bought at open, but fucking ER is always X files for me. Glad I waited
Party’s over
Haven't you sell yet?
The gaybear knew it all along..
Today was fucking amazing until it wasn’t
Bounce spy bounce!
Not surprising. The run up it’s had was pretty sick due to FOMO at $900 and $1,000.
How come his wife's name sounds like a joke?
It's never what I most, or least suspect will happen. It's always what I most medium suspect.

I managed to buy CRWD calls at the exact top.  Down 65% lol there go my NVDA profits and then some
This was just dirty
I should have waited until the power hour for FB calls fuck
Good move on picking up FB
What the Fuck is up Denny’s?!? GSK earnings in the morning. Low IV, plenty of good news to go around. I’m balls deep, you should be too.
The amount of money I left on the table today is sickening
!banbet OCGN 100 16d
Currently $4k in the hole today because of a fintel error, fuck me right
Tell me about it, totally agree. My parents got a second home in Turkey and ended up getting 250,000Lira in debt. This was like two years ago when 1Lira was equivalent to around £0.14.

Flip back to today and 1 lira is like £0.07 ... their debt HALVED. insane stuff

I thought the Euphoria and Greed would last a little bit longer .......
FB bankruptcy eod
Any predictions for when BBBY ceases to be a complete hunk of shit? Eyeballing some 16 Cs but this thing looks like it’s gonna suck for a while
Think I remember seeing a mixed bag this morning in terms of PT's. FB is too tricky for me to trade.
Where’s the juice?  Everything going red. 😕
It’s called an opportunity
Lol TSLA baby what are you doing
Imagine not buying the spy and tesla dip
Told you it was too euphoric in here this morning.
Who is nuking SPY? It sure wasn't LMT
Who’s van betting Tesla to 120 lmaoo
amd fucking up
PLTR gets perpetually confused around 26
Like clockwork. Just buy Tesla FDs any price bro. It only goes up bro. Let’s go back to Wendy’s now fuckers
If PYPL finishes sub 241.. I'm taking the biggest bong rip of my life (I'm gonna do it anyways)
Wait what the fuck happened
[deleted]
TSLA getting bloody red
You literally just described ever blue chip tech company
I didn’t even think we would see red THIS soon
Wanted to buy some leaps, but damn, zuck is getting the dildo
FB gonna spend 10B I think on their metauniverse and a lot of it will goes to NVDA hardware
what're you assuming for your missed gains?
👏🏼AAPL👏🏼will👏🏼remain👏🏼strong👏🏼
NVDA doing all it can to try and save my portfolio today
Look at vix right now
Oh fuk

I always tell my self profit is profit but if I'm not making $1,000 ATLEAST then I don't even want it 🤣 today I'm glad I just got out cause I would've been down about $800 right about now
[deleted]
I don’t know what sucks more: being up at the beginning of the day and then going deep red or just starting deep red with no chance of getting your money back lol
[deleted]
What's the deal with Zuckerborg and FB? He butthurt and he cry?
PROG squeezing
\*Breaking News\* Facebook renames to "The Zucc Zone" causing massive sell offs in the market today
those "fun" holders aren't have much fun anymore
when approval hits it's going to 100 and then eventually to mRNA's price of like 300 once you see india's incredible production numbers like they sell 3 billion vaccines per year = TONNSSSSSSS of profit. mRNA sold like what 50 million ?? and their stock went up to 300$
Dow and S&amp;P were at ATH high today. What crash bro lol
!banbet TSLA +3% 2d
TSLA negative..  list your EOD bets!
decided to be bold. BABA and BIDU Jan calls, and FB shares from the dip. gl
Tesla red and so is my account
Meh, just closing the gap to yesterday's high
DWAC 165c 11/19
Apes don’t evolve
Sold my TSLA 1000p too early because I ride the short bus
No way this shit actually gonna end red?
buying a call just before earnings after a 25% run up...

bold move cotton, let’s see how it plays out for him
I’m loving SPY rn 🥰
I’m not a bear but $TSLA is going to bleed so hard now that it’s red.
PROG? Up 400%
Cucked and fucked
Wake me when I can claim unrealized loss deductions.
Picked up 8500 CLOV shares for earnings on the 8th of nov
My boy went to take a nap in hopes that his FB calls will come back. Definitely an unorthodox strategy

&amp;#x200B;

edit: I don't think he put a stop loss in either
Friends dont let friends buy Options....
My 460 calls stabbed me in the back...
Where's Sophie's new bottom? I like this girl and want back in 😘
And Tesla is red. FUCK
ppl been saying that everyday since 2008 and then 2018 happened and the market recovered and grew 3x larger a month later lol
PayPal can suck my 2 inch cock.
Times and Sales Tab in think or swim
I heard DWAC is going to have flying cars, too! Show us that loss porn mango island boys.
NVDA defies gravity.
When dwac shoots up 1,000% in 2 days, what compels some of you complete morons to then FOMO into it thinking it’s going up another 1,000%?  Or even 50%?  Like, this is completely and utterly baffling to me. 

You missed the runup, get over it and move on. Don’t buy into it. Jesus.
DWAC 165 c 11/19
I have buyer's remorse
Why is VIX ripping up???
FOMO'd back into Tesla after buying puts yesterday. Now losing money on all positions
That would be bullish
Will it happen before market closes?
The fuck is going on with fb

Did zuck finally get fucked?
I can already see people saying Fuck Cathie and Elon in the future lol.
How did TSLA monthlies only cost $80-$110?? You must have bought way OTM.

So with 2.5k you made 88k?? Those are great returns!!
spent the last hour looking for a good robe but my vision is too precise.

this is why zuckerberg's metaverse will succeed
Oof
SPY Puts: **"Come with me if you want to live 😎"**
Should I hold my spy 454 calls 10/27 or sell
Man I’m hoping that happens. Absolutely got fucked by holding these calls
It was priced in to do better lol
Fundamentals don't matter
upstart? more like downstart
*Let's cause a monster crash and get filthy rich in a flash*
instructions unclear, large men coated in olive oil have broken down my front door
Woah damn this shit is being manipulated rn
I knew my FB leaps would be fucked but didn't think they'd be this fucked
Okay PYPL stop with the funny stuff and go back to 241
The fuck is happening to FB? Just when you think something is sure fire win it moves against you harder than your wife's boyfriend.
It gets bad for people with savings accounts. It can be amazing for people with debt. Inflation here in Argentina is like 50%+, and it's going to get worse.
From +9.7k to -14.8k fucking fuck
Look at the graphs of the big 5 FAANG tech stocks over the last 5 years and tell me their current trajectory is sustainable
People said the exact same thing last time TSLA hit 1000. That they loaded up on puts. It had a day where it did well then cooled off and consolidated. Then those put buyers were fucked the rest of the week and into the next month.
sell spy puts 50% gain or hold til we go red?!?!
My FB 315c already down 15% lol
Ugh my gains, spy, you're undoing my gains!
Wave goodbye to $1000 on your way down, TSLA bulls
isn't what?

How exactly do these clowns think they're going to scale their site, and maintain availability while also moderating content at scale?

How exactly are they going to pivot the operation of one [ripped-off open source webapp](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740354/trump-truth-social-network-spac-mastodon-license-software-freedom-conservancy) into a public cloud competing with the other established public clouds?

the whole thing was written on hopes and dreams. It has hostile work environment red flags left and right, and no competent engineer is going to put their reputation on the line to run this shop. It's a shitty investment and that's my DD as a masto admin myself.
Left for lunch and not coming back...
If you are in yours 20s and not worth 7 figures+ you want the market to crash to buy in cheap. Don’t pump this shit up to inflate boomer wealth
Nice fake dip before earnings calls gonna print
Oh that’s so not good for tesla. Time to exit soon
OCGN is super easy mode... +50% already today and the approval wasnt even announced yet, which will skyrocket it up to mRNA's level (from 10$ to 300$)
Should I have sold my SPY 460 EOW? Feeling like I should have lol
To many people stuck at 1090$
Boomers took it over....
Gay bear time
Bro you about just 1 year late. You alllllmost had it
Talk about a classic double bottom on PROG. We have lift-off
earnings today after hours
Large funds are shit canning their positions. Owning FB is like owning tobacco maybe worse
Talking bout hood?
Human trafficking, mostly.
Mfw I timed the top perfectly.
DWACS BE LIKE: 

https://youtu.be/1lWJXDG2i0A
Eh they are trying to pass legislation so they can hire new tech beurocrats.  Not enough dc insiders in tech because it requires a hard skillset.
Papa Elon thanks for the bags
wait until elon's next pump tweet

until then OCGN is flying today probably higher than TSLA
In that case, I’m down 100k because I chose to invest in Corsair
If NVDA isn't $260 by this Friday I'm gonna $ROPE
this market so crazy. fb falls 5% in a day on news that revenue ONLY went up 55% YOY lol
Probably ate a baby for breakfast but that would have already been priced in. Dunno why the drop with the PT upgrades.
For my birthday Friday I would like OCGN $50
Sounds scary af. I woulda dropped my Hot Pocket
Be patient you childish cockwomble.
fb 0 eod confirmed
Didn't even qualify as a correction.
eat a dick softbank go pour more money into the wework dumpster fire
and just like that, everything red for me...![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|table_flip)
Deal with Entain got called off, when it was announced it dropped like 14%
if you buy calls, and then keep buying shares, you can sell ur call for profit which moves price up and then sell ur shares for more profit
PROG all the way.
SPY baby what happened
How can I trust you
Market crashes because labor costs go up. Investors are pussies
Yes, price targer up and facebook will be buying more shit from them, ai, data servers, graphics
Facefucked by FB
I was wondering the same, not sure why moon, might be sympathy with AMD in anticipation of earnings
Someone doesn't want TSLA red 🧐

It's me. I am someone.
Anyone know what’s going on with Facebook ?
They've been that way forever but they crossed a certain line you don't get to cross, that's my point
Not even a correction , literally just a regular red month , correction is 10% , crash is like 40%-50%
DWACkers give us the loss porn we deserve!
Chazdaq is fucking everyone now
holy shit what happen to fb and bakkt
just buy OCGN stock... simple... +50% returns today already
Will these AMD calls print?
Oh my god I finally figured this market out!  Think back a few years.  Everyone and their dog was joining or recruiting for an MLM.  Then pandemic strikes and MLM’s die.  Millions of hustlers looking for a MLM to join… welcome to meme stock mania…
I mean sure that'd be dumb, but opportunity cost is also a thing
Jesus Christ pltr. From up $5000 to up $1500
wait til ya see my big testicle ban bets on this ticker in the next few days if the ticker hits 53 or below.
ATH recession confirmed
Last year it went up in the first half of Oct then dived back down again
SPY can drop 2 full % and still be up multiple % from last week
$HYFM always goes up when I don’t own it, only down when I do 🤷🏼‍♀️

Maybe I should just buy a LEAP and exercise it so I don’t have such an ugly cost basis
Can you touch me?
Did you see that they bought LemonAid? Did you see the collaboration with GSK?
Man this day started off so fun then boom 10:45 hits and we all head to Wendy’s for lunch. Fuck.
Lmaooooo bears we're not even red 😂🤣🤡

*(looking at my -88% calls)*
&gt;DKNG

Why? What happened?
If.they cant makes their own stocks go up what's their incentive?
DON'T TASE ME, BRO!!!!
One huge boom, followed by lots of fire. Set off house alarms. Pooped my pants
I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO SELL TESLA
There will be no cheese program this time. Democrats hate cow farts.
AMZN earnings???????
He should market that.. "Donald Rumps. Shit your pants bigly? Let em think it's fake poo's."
Market is a woman.
:) ok than it excuse if you are 13....no bubbble.
holy shit OCGN getting approval and they have the most factories and largest output in the world??? india can produce 3 billion vaccines per year, basically india will dominate vaccine market they have the most resources to do so. OCGN is going to mirror mRNA's prices, huuuge jump incoming
PLTR can’t count up to 30.
was up 2k on AMD calls, down to 500 in a fucking flash. fucking rainbow bears eat shit.
Gonna get bloody the rest of the day and perhaps the next couple.
Literally making all the wrong moves today. So frustrating when that happens.
I feel like it usually runs pre earnings tbh
Why JOBY? As someone who follows it closely.
Whilst I agree, I just wanted to put things into perspective, on how much 5.4% YoY inflation is. It needs to ease up soon or everything can get very bad very, very quickly
PROG please pull an AMC atleast bb Kisses 🐶😽
Just a heads up, I paid for 3 months in advance on my SPOT subscription last month, you guys can thank me when they beat on earnings
Investing in Advanced Money Destroyer is always a trip
Fukin guh
very exhilarating
11/5, sorry.  FOMC next week. Too many green days. The S&amp;P is going to pull back for sure. They will print later this week or early next week. Maybe later today or tomorrow even.
#look at the greeks!

#(not just the sorority girls)
I swear I was just thinking this! Yahoo is slaughtering FB at any opportunity
This is an options sub take your shares and GTFO!
Can we go back to when everything was just ripping?
Jeez. Like “ boom boom” ?
FB is a shit company with terrible business practices and it's being punished for it... What's the problem here?
Been awhile since I chilled with my SOFI bros but what’s the end game here lads? Do we buy nov 12 calls for earnings? What strike
So was there any NVDA news today?
SoFi is getting fucked.
bro lol
please fly tesla
Didn’t realize a correction was a collapse🤔
so now we're taking the stairs back down?
Oh, for fuck’s sake! 

Someone turn off the console, blow on the cartridge, and put the fucking game back on **EASY MODE.**
Lol at thinking any social media company isn't one
SOMEONE SAVE ME IF YOU WILL AND TAKE AWAAAAAYYYYEEEE ALL THESE PILLS

Anyone know why TSLA is $1040?
Pretty good at spelling too
Easy money
Sept 2021, like 3-4 ish weeks ago
No
Once it cracks this 40 again it’s gonna go flying
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
There was kind of a collapse mid-August too.
Minor misses on earnings targets, stock buyback, some headwinds from iOS privacy settings.
I feel like DKNG should be up a lot more on this news, considering buying more
c'mon NET, this is your chance to DIE
Dw there's an army of guys with contracts behind you .. hopefully you have sometime .. I'm bullish on Intel.
Anyone else notice the coordinated assault against Facebook both in the media and market?...no?...on we go 🐑
If so, I'm paying off my car and going on vacation.
What's the deal wit amd I bought a option call idk is something interesting going to happen

Oh shit. I didn't expect that
Imo it’s a buy at 330.
they continue to be worth the same, i.e., 1:4 split, existing options are now for 400 instead of 100 units.

i bought some NVDA 252.50 weeklies, hope they go ITM by friday
Because the S&amp;P is going to pull back before it runs to 460.
Inflation can be great if you play it right. 1.5 years ago I was paying 20.000 pesos ($240 at the time) for a small apartment. I'm currently paying 48.000 pesos ($245 now) for a place that's like 4 times the size.
WHALE ALERT 🐳🚨 $840 buy order for 3 11/19 $56 SNAP calls just purchased by this retard to capitalize on the rebound
Investing is going well. Too well…….. 👀

Just did the opposite of that with DIS FD.
Meaning if you bought them at open you'd have a 5-6 bagger right now.
You mean retard, welcome home!
When's the last time there were 2 stock market collapses in back to back months? Like we had one all of September, no way it happens again in October
Never gain.

Where this recession coming from ?

If you haven’t noticed half the people in here hate their real life and spend 90% of their time absorbed in their phones. Virtual reality will be big because people don’t want to live their real lives anymore. Sad, but true

I have been hoping for red for months
Are you guys trapped enough?

You are all thinking the same thing now: you should have sold today in the morning. Asking the same question yourself: why? Why am I like this? Why am I greedy always and end up losing money at the end. You are waiting for a little up move to sell your calls but we both know that it is not gonna happen.

No, they will not give you this chance...
&gt; No, I’m just a bot.

You did good lad, you did good 👏
get a 15k loan from them and double down
I didn't know a stock could commit hari kari. What's the deal ASAN? Being maintained at equal weight was just too much stress?
Thoughts on HOOD earnings later today?
Never sell. Never lose

It has always struggled around 27/29 always. It just can’t break that resistance level. Earnings could do it. But that’s risky af
Suck my unit
So anybody know why Tesla absolutely gets shorted on when it tries to go past $1,040? Why is resistance so harsh there
Don't tell me we'll be red for the next 3 weeks
I jumped on snap with the pump, started losing and doubled down. Lost more tripled down and wiped out a bunch of gains. Closed the position.

It's been 14 days since the market last entered me rectally.  I'm almost starting to miss the pain.
Lol
bro how many times you gonna post this? you're poor we get it
Why
Bought $18k worth FB 300p 10/29 yesterday at $2. Opened up at 27 fucking cents and somehow I'm clawing my way back to the surface.
Let the US default on its debt in December and I’ll buy you all tendies (but you’ll need to share the pieces amongst yourselves, don’t be greedy)
Just a little bit. I’m worried for amd cause of earnings but I’m hopeful they’ll do well.
&gt;No. This is the pop.  Cash in if you in the green
i think we close red (i hope 🙈🥺)

Amazon Treasure Truck text came through for PS5 with Disk Drive.  Was sold out within a minute.  Bullish.
I mean, take your pick of any of FBs horrific issues and there's your reason why. My personal favorite is Zuckerberg wanting to focus on improving Gen Z market capture by launching Instagram for kids, despite knowing that Instagram is devastating to the body image of young boys and girls.
Sounds better than owning DWAC.
10/5?
!banbet WDC +6% 5d
Good thing I sold my spy calls for a slight gain instead of holding and watching my money burn like I usually do. Still should've sold way sooner though
this market needs bears. remember that
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
FB to $280
You blind fucking bat
Yeah, already being up 200% and it being a relatively small position let’s me be a little riskier with it.
!banbet DWAC 1000 2w
You are unfortunately right. Nobody remember the last meme stock down 60% from all time high when the new one come along.
There’s fewer of you and more of the $100+ bag holders. Congrats.
It literally has 20 upgrades between yesterday and today
Where do you see that? Like what do you follow to see these trades happening?
I thought so so I didn’t.
*This afternoon
10/5 puts can't lose.
70k/yr is basically poverty
Yes
Every fucking time
Sell AMD now or wait after close? 🤔
Dude Lockheed has the most headline risk of any stock out there. Everything can look good and then boom a plane gets recalled and it falls 20% never again will I touch that stock.
Say it ain’t so!
Alright PROG and OCGN about to pay big…
India is probably pushing WHO pretty hard to get their own vaccine approved. Its a matter of pride and national security for countries to have their own vaccines.

It’s extremely clear you haven’t used a high end VR. 

I have the Valve Index, “Real gameplay” is absolutely not impossible. Half Life Alyx and Pavlov are two of my favorite games, o *any* system. Pavlov and other VR shooters are hands down, not even a debate, the future of shooters.

Motion sickness goes away quickly. I can play for an entire day, of motion intensive games, and get zero sickness. Took owning the system for about a week. 

Very much not a gimmick. Seems like you haven’t used it.

Especially with the “mind controlled by VR” starving to death nonsense.
I think we could see a dip this week due to profit taking once big boys publish earnings
Bought 3 NVDA $250c 11/5 for 5.6 a piece. Will it print?
Maybe Tesla  but no Twitter and google for fun
Escalator up, elevator down on that chart 😬

Is anyone buying vxx calls?

FB will completely rebound right after my calls expire next week, I'll bet on balls on it
my gay bear senses are tingling
I SPY with my little eye another all time high.
TSLA spreads at 11am today
did it just fall a bunch? lots of times those targets are outdated and thus innacurate.
Pro tip: buy when options are already up on the day so they show up green on your RH
God my puts hope so.

It’s just overkill at this point
Hoping for a strong after hour OCGN, sold calls early and in shares only from here on.

I closed my 27/10 $460 position today for 5% gain. Got there from 99% loss, too scurred to hold them longer, shit seems fragile.
OPEN BY OPEN
nature is healing itself, PLTR is worth maybe 20 a share right now
Brace yourself FB downgrades incoming.
Spy 460 eow too many good earnings for this to not happen
Yes
Wait til Thursday or Friday
What did you day trade? Need help, I’m down 50%
When it hits 1200 or more I'm sure this ain't over.shits gonna be a fomo fest once it does stock split
Just bought a bunch of SPY puts because fuc tech earnings. They are all overpriced anyway.
That was me with my SPY calls Friday. The difference between 209% and 5% smh
trading what
Whoa, parking an EV is extra
Mango 🥭 was something that we forgot to quickly, how wonderful, like it never happened.

Gme retards celebrating a tesla decline when they can't even get gme past 200.

You think they're gonna have an earnings pop?
I guess so. Just looks vertical on the 1 day chart haha
KEEP BUYING CORSAIR
Without a doubt
No, for long hold it is still good time now .
Hear me out… if they tax unrealized gains then they need to have a tax credit for unrealized losses.  We are gonna be so fucking rich!!!
SPY finally comin down some too
FB leaps are irresistible at this very moment
It’ll come back, this was just profit taking. Tesla is a great company with a great product!
Nope. I got a PLTR leap the other day Jan 2023 2.5c

Still have my eye on `DWAC Nov 19 '21 $35 Put`
Yeah, tough play. Definite hold.
Why? Obviously I’m buying shares of that there’s no way you can win on options for 2022. I don’t mind the lowered guidance for 2022 it’s to be expected, I’m mainly interested in the growth coming after that

Is it too late to buy $PLTR?
idk, it's mostly a gimmick. real gameplay is impossible in VR, like movement sucks and people getting sick throwing up cuz it's such a disorienting experience, then the games are like all half assed, then you have people in asia dying from forgetting about their hunger and body needs cuz theyre so mind controlled by VR lol and keep playing until they literally pass out of exhaustion and starve
I can somewhat agree about the transitory part: a sustained 5% inflation would kill everything. But the controlled? I don’t know about that
How many of the people who got in sub 10 are still holding? The stock had a rocky day yesterday, but ended red. It's big time red today and doesn't look like it's picking up, speculation is dying down. All of the people that made money, great (I only made 1k day trading it, but almost lost my shirt when it started tanking). Regardless of your political views, there is no product yet. The current price is unjustified and will keep falling before it lands on a more realistic price. People buying now expecting to 2x or more have missed the boat... who taught you math? It was 175 a few days ago and now its 69

There’s literally no reason for a long term market pullback in the next few months. A pullback on crude oil may cause a dip but all dips will be bought in this environment.

Listen to this. If you had a million dollars right now, next year it would be worth around $950,000 due to current inflation rate. 

How insane does that sound

Fkn zuck tard had to open his mouth.
Imagine if SPY just drilled and filled all the gaps. That would be amazing.
Welp it looks like Tesla banned my ass for a week
For one I've seen it shoot up twice this year. I like it for them being meme stocks and also a promising portfolio. Weed stocks are up and coming as well as BB as a tech giant. People downvote because they are impatient and pissed for the two stocks not mooning already, but I believe they will in near future. I like the futuristic concepts BB provide (reddit BB_stock) as well as SNDL being a huge weed stock with good fundamentals (reddit SNDL), but long story short TLDR: retard with a dream who likes two stocks a little bit too much.
[deleted]
50 years from now people are gonna be talking about this market, it will go something like this:

"I can't believe you had the opportunity to buy TSLA at 1 trillion grandpa, that is crazy! You could've bought an entire company back then for the cost of a loaf of bread today, you were so lucky!"
Curls and shrugs
They are but if you go to restaurant they probably get fried in the same fryer as the tendies.
Vix creeping
Pltr what the fuck are you doing
they competed test flight, battery tests, everything is good, theyre just refining everything. when they start selling flights around major cities the stock will go from 10$ to 200$ to 1200$ overnight
These guys hate winning so much they shit on regular sex and free milk
After 1PM ET / 12PM CT, the market is going to collapse, tomorrow will be a drop, God speed boys!
just pooped
Earnings weren't super good. Still lingering concerns about advertisement revenue from AAPL security stuff. They did announce a stock buy back though.
TSLA 1100 is going to happen this week. No doubt

WISH
This is the entry point for TSLA if you missed it
No idea if SPY puts or calls are the play right now. Hate sitting out but I think it’s my best bet. This uptrend just feels fragile to me, but I don’t feel confident we’re gonna drop either

&gt; The company is printing cash, but it's not real. It doesn't have any value because you can't use the money to buy anything useful.
I’m scared 🥺
at open
Worried that earnings in a few weeks might pull the plug on its current bull run. Despite positive sentiment recently, the company doesnt really seem to be doing too anything real, although their long term plans could have major upside potential
octobear is over

Just wanted to let you know I read this comment. I also read the comment that someone else read it and wanted to let you know, so I am letting you know too
Y’all bought TSLA based on literally nothing but a personality cult. 

Take your medicine.

Down 30% on my January FB calls. Doubled down and went all in. 100% of my portfolio is now in FB calls lmfao 14k down the drain

OCGN recovering nicely from a random halt this morning.  Thanks SEC or whoever!
So why is fb dying ?
Day late
Right here! Bloody hands so far but they are recovering
Is Josh and Steph fighting on air? 🤔
Haha, true, but it's MUCH funnier variations on that sentiment
FB.....they're not taking the blue pill anymore Zuck.....
people think that because I trade UVXY that I must hold shares of it.

“lol zoom out of the chart”

you guys know you can buy PUTS AND CALLS right???

Now who wants to tell daddy what rhymes with frog, but is greener, more ripe for squeezing, and ready for a buyout?

These two days weren’t actually a yolo. I bought the calls weeks ago when they cost $80-$110 each. Dropped $2100 on Tesla 970c and a few hundred on 1050c 

If I knew how high Tesla was going to go I would’ve did a yolo
Brace for impact. Next stop is 305, then 270.
Prog saving me
My thought is digital advertising spend is going to be very low for the next few quarters and Pinterest is going to see their cash flow slow to a trickle
Just bought first ever Call, 29 Oct OCGN $9. Have no idea what im doing 😂
COME ON TESLA HOLD ONNNNN
And it will, but not today. I've said it before, but RSI is at 92. We're going to see that thing drop into the 70s before TSLA bounces back up.
At least when it drops 5% intraday and establishes a solid support before going back up, I’m less nervous it’ll drop 20% today. 😂
not if, when 🚀
Ahhhh and it did. 25k in my account only took a year and a half and almost all thanks to UCO
 Lol Josh Brown and Stephanie Link going at it on CNBC
I sold before last amd earnings and it ripped from 95-120

98 percent of the folio is in FB calls I’m down 30 percent on.. but I have 1 weekly SPY put I’m up 70 percent on so that’s nice 🙂

FB just gonna sit this one ☝️ out
So given fb dumping, does this mean Google earnings are fucked too?
Just added a share of $FB. Like the price. It'll probably drop even more and I'll probably add a second.
I ended up selling it and buying snap calls. Snap dropped like 30% in a day so i think I bought at the right time. Hopefully I can turn a quick profit with these while I wait for amd to dip
PLTR is how Skynet begins
MSFT BABY NO GO BACK UP🥺😢

Yeah rich ppl manipulation. Trash aholes need to split the stock or else random rich guy puts a million dollar n calls profit
I would have actually shorted Tesla in the morning if my broker gave me decent bid-ask spread on it but my broker is a cunt who has a nearly 1% bid-ask spread on tesla...

Nah... you're wrong... A company that was filing bankrupcy two months ago said it would buy billions of dollars worth of Telsas... That can't be priced in in two days. I mean that news means there will be 100K guaranteed sales by Telsa. No way Hertz can't fill their promises, the company is rock solid.

Fucc the Zucc:

I SPY with my brown eye

a red dildo heading right for me!
My expierience trading Amazon tells me it will brake expectations, go up a bit and be dumped the same day or after earnings. Mofos always do the same
Any thoughts on qs earnings?
I told y’all earlier, take profits. The bloodbath hasss to come, we’re seeing too much green.
So I made a lot off boeing calls in April 2020, and then throughout the year until recently I’ve been losing that money that I made 

These last two days I made back what I lost and then some more
Nice! I wish I had settled cash to buy puts today. Would have been good
Wait for the three day rule
except when you buy the top of a bubble
Aaaand back to red.

So tired of this game.
I’m getting rekt
Lol.....you're buying?
Can you let me know when you’re gonna buy so I can sell
Why are we even selling off?
CRSR and RKT are probably the worst stocks to own in this market. Of course i own both
The 200 is a weekly (now 100 lol). The 250 is 110c for January and the other is 140c for January. Probably should close the weekly
Call me a guy that likes a girl with a penis but I like the 5min chart on that new social media thing

So I'm confused. It sounded like you broke even today but now it sounded like you just lost what you earned last year, last year?
Y'all are drama queen 🐻

I bought QQQ puts: 12/1 $370, 12/31 $375, 12/31 $370 

All are already +6-7%

I expect this to be a success as of the coming weeks.
Once we break past 457.54 then yess. For now I think this is a test I didn’t fucking study for.
a batch of downgrades came out
I have, i needed something boomer to get my margin.

Apparently other parts of my portfolio are "high risk / Junk" stocks therefore can't be used as collateral.
Dude trying to give advice. Says go cash gang for two years and let your money lose 30%. Fucking retard idiot. Ban
Holy shit defense stocks getting killed. LMT plunging 11%. Unheard of. Buy of the century. Buy this dip in your IRA and your old self will be so grateful
It’s still early guys, relax lol

If GME hits $1000 this place would be like a zoo without the zoo keepers
amzn I thought you were the shit but turns out you’re just a wet fart
The only hyperinflation is in stock prices.
This is Warren Buffett's secret account. I don't work for banks, the banks work for me
I said the same thing about BABA
I’ll pay 10x the price to hang with D.Pump
Jacked to the soy soakers with weeklies in TQQQ, TSLA and HOOD
All time highs in January.
Facebook crushed because of earnings or because of whistleblower bs?
OCGN guaranteed $30
wtf someone bombed chyna?
Bet, bot.
Spy puts don't @ me
FB heading on its way out of the S&amp;P 500
Okay FB time to deploy that buyback… any minute now
yeah im not an idiot
Not really. They don’t sell their stock because they borrow against it
First time I’m playing pltr and actually making money
or die harder tomorrow
Always willing to help the homies out💪😤
So what’s the hood play?
$TSLA is now an exact repeat of Jan 26 2021 ATH! 🥲
MS, GOOG, and V better report well tonight or my extremely SPY FD heavy port is gonna be truly boned.
Cause you either sold or are bag holding and too ashamed
Well fuck. Snap fucked me with that fake pump.
\*transferred , the money went from retarded retail to the 1%
i can't believe you made me go check those stupid RKT bags i've been holding
If you're in the market for dividends get Bank of America. The share price is rising rapidly plus they're paying a larger dividend!
He bought TSLA calls? DOMP EET
All smarts covered only idiots like me got caight
PLTR - “I WANNA GO FAST”
So I should go homeless? Got it
MYSE going crazy
Yes. Taxing unrealized gains is literally retarded. Not like joking retarded. 5 extra chromosomes retarded.
If FB touches $300, going all in
If you went into a coma today for a week, how fucked would your options portfolio be?
I shut my computer off and curled up in a ball on my bed. Was a $200k dip for me
i bought the dip lets go
They call me Jon 👀 Nigerian
Uh that's shit advice.  You would miss out on SPY 600
bruh...how many shares
I made a lot off boeing calls when it was at $90 in 2020 and lost it 🤣
TSLA can go back up now. K thx. Bye
Tesla is free from the gamma squeeze.  Epic amount of 1050c and up bagholders.  10/29s are dominant.  This stock is trending down for the rest of the week
Rip
I'm about to earn my red wings, cause im buried in RDBX.
Tesla has to hold this support it made yesterday or else the gay bears are gonna take over
How he gonna talk about it? he’s banned on social media and only poor people go to his rallies.
yeah, fuck me
One day, my friend, one day…
TSLA $1500 EOW, right guys?
Not saying it would happen, but if we finished red, people are getting crushed.
The shorts are making a stand on OCGN. They do not want to see that stock break out.
Spy tanking
Die today. Fly tomorrow
Anyone wanna invest in my lemonade stand??? Better yet, YOLO
Woah such insight u should work for the banks

If you are holding multiple calls, and are not sure what to do, cover your cost basis, take profit on ½-⅔. Let the other 3rd ride
What company has a robot butcher? Thats where the money at!
This analyst who downgraded UPsT can choke on a fat cock
Fuk you xpev. Fuk
Iz rkt gonna meme again 😩
Everyone focused on TSLA but the real future is LILM. Fuck cars, I wanna fly!
Typo 260$ 10/29 yesterday close 0.04 bought 100 of them sold this morning at 1.11$ per contract
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
For me it’s because I’m in the top tax bracket so if I sell I lose 45% to the government. Tempted to hold until January for tax purposes. Also it’s NVDA which is dump proof.
Bears predicted the last 3 crashes 627 times. Amazingly accurate!
This advice will age well. Sell all your assets, except index funds you're planning to hold for 20+ years. Buy back when market is 50% of what it is now in 1-2 years. Thank me later
Sell it moron
Cheers for tsla bagholders

PYPL is personally ensuring that I get banned on Friday, what a dick!
And there goes $TSLA &amp; $SPY… 💀💀💀
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is an American stock market index based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ. It is one of several indices created by Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) and it serves as a measure of overall movement for stocks in the United States equity markets
Probably because LOGI is sucking so much.
They really about to get everyone over leveraged then dump it 5% for taper talks lol
it's the perfect example of not crossing 200 ever again

Money is so fleeting look at this shit, Tesla about to go red for the day, so much money wiped in a few hours
huh? that contract closed at 7k a contract fuck you talking about
no, that would be FB.
The control they have over the market is unbelievable to me.
No one is getting into DWAC
Tesla Not bullish anymore
This^
Oooh
Money flowing out of ZUCK and into MUSK

Kinda regret not realizing that 600% gain on TSLA. My 1125C has next week expiry so I think I will sit on it.
My SPY puts are rising from the ashes.
# DWAC = Dog shit. lowest of the low. Worst than fuken Theranos scam.
I’m not retarded I’m just stupid
congratulations to the dude 4 days ago who got a lot of PLTR calls for earnings
I bought AAPL leaps when NVDA was trading at $200 🤡

Cus i bought at open and big daddy government says im too poor to day trade
Damn FB is really out here getting clapped
Stinky time is about to happen
Me too. Too much hood porn on this website
TSLA bring the whole market down with it
The crazy volatility just tells me its valuation is based entirely on speculation instead of actual deliverables. I'd be hesitant to buy at half its current price.
&gt; I'm sorry, I can't find that song.
What bill
😢
Daddy thiel finally came back from his cigarette run
Thanks. Not sure how it helps though
nice market u got here

Wrong. My account is doubled and i sold gme at 199.99 sept 20th

Keep dreaming on 200 though. Gme was propped up by apes. It's been steadily gojng down because half of us got out and won't go back in leaving a lot of bag holders
Cost basis of 55.64, easy 20bagger
Why does CRSR suck so much?
Bruh, FB. Stop shitting the bed. You’re fucking up my SPY calls
FB already ruined the internet and now it's coming for our tendies qq
Now buy fds
HOLY Big tiddy anime girl. Tesla loses $10 in a second lolllll
PLTR and GME going upsies
Amazon just delivered to my house in a Hertz branded sprinter van.
Why do WSBters hate taking profits? Y’all only sell when y’all are down -90%

I would wait till we hit 295 before I would buy shares

Thank you nvda bought x100 10/29 260c yesterday at 500$. Sold today for 11k (&gt;2000% return)
Lol why not take half off the table when you’re up 100%?
8 - 10 gap up on SHPW coming
So billionaires want the Fed to inflate their stocks but then bitch about taxes on unrealized gains
How am I down today?

Every time I think of buying back in there's a huge red stick

Share buybacks are generally considered bearish. Puts on FB.

holy shit the puts of my straddle would have been in the money had I held em. Total capitulation.
Can’t wait to build up my portfolio to 25k in Robinhood so I can fucking day trade more

Ribbit ribbit 🐸
How is it even possible to lose in this market
If anyone here actually thinks TSLA will break $1100 by Friday. You are severely underdeveloped mentally. Buy $950 puts for Friday and thank me later
TSLA about to fuck up a brand new cohort of shorts. All aboard retards!
GME time ❤️🦍🚀💪
TSLA calls are cheap! Fear not!
Everytime mang....everytime
Funny last weekend this whole place was 🥭🥭🥭🥭🥭 all day. Now everyone is quiet about it like it never happened.
BB OTM FDs finna print you little sluts
1100C 10-29
PLTR gang gang   


bussin'
fuck it, hedging my calls with GME calls
&gt; $57 is unrealistic
NVDA is up so much because FB plans on increasing capex in AI/ML. Both companies work very closely
Double bottom , just like 2 gay bears
# F your puts
Let's see PYPL $241 EOD please
Lunch time= dump time. People taking profits only to buy more. Tesla will come back gents.
$200 trillion is too high, at least 3 though is going to happen
whats up with the zucc empire?
That's all I'm betting on. If he talks about it, boom, straight back up.
PLTR is Alive!!
I'd buy your shares for $200 a pop sure
SNAP, can you go back to $57? $58 would be better
Go PLTR Go
Try holding it for 24 hours.
someone wants to take my pltr shares at 27, i can feel it
[deleted]
Puts are so cheap here honestly
TSLA to DWAC rotation underway…..
nope, hell is only starting for intel
Reminder that TSLA had 3 dofferent periods of sideways trading in between leaps yesterday
PLTR to 30 by EOW. And then back to 24 next week
someone’s broke mad and has no hair 😂
And just like that my FB calls have turn from a trade to an investment
PLTR all in OTM calls
This. Every time I get greedy I get fucked. Take profit and play dips.
Yes, and try zooming out further than the two hour. Then hold and watch it go up month to month.
If you got a weekly you still have time
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
It looks good to me
When the bill passes DOW is going to moon and tech will drop.  Always happens. Just a warning.
Tesla at $1040 which is the same form I'm gonna use to report all of my gains.
Is this PLTR’s time to shine?
chilling
Wall Street Bets Mutual Fund, anyone?
With FB the trend is your friend, itll settle down and pump again. If BLM didnt kill the zuck, teens and kids wont
GET IT
&gt; I'm not a fruit fly.

sell and sit on money for a while
pypl is broken
Just look at it, it is the perfect example of a bullish uptrend
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640) tesla:///
shut up and buy more $TSLA calls
Yes, TSLA puts
Meetings are for people who don’t want to work. Don’t want to do shit until noon? Call a production meeting.
Any predictions for $BA’s earning? I’m thinking calls.

Is everyone here a fruit fly? Are you looking at the 4hr chart on SPY going 'THE TOP IS IN SEL SEL SEL SEL", haven't even got the first announcement. Calling 600% gainers bag holders. If this was anything else do you think people would be acting so dumb
Upvote because low level troll.

#1 analist issues a buy rating
whats the move besides dumping monthly allowances into ASTS
Government could mint that $1 trillion coin and buy off TSLA with it. Then it will turn into $10 trillion in a few years and pay off a big chunk of national debt.
Literally is not
Bears are in denial just like April/May when we started talking off like rocket ship.
I’m up 60%. The delta is -.36. I sold a 1000 put for Friday against it for $14 so I’m locked in 😀
well this is just Robinhood, but yeah it's in the settings somewhere, i just did it last week. can't remember if it was in the help section or the PDT section
Makes sense after another 5:1 split
My day in a nutshell: I sell my PLTR calls moments before it goes up to buy TSLA calls the moment it goes down
After 10-1 split
Strike and expir
Sold my TSLA put up $1000…Tesla options some crapshoot
I’m just a multi layered genius thinker, out thinking the market and my account
Because WSB is so obsessed with buying the dip even when the dip is justified and there are a million better opportunities elsewhere. See: FB
Big agree, try at-the-money options with SPY or a single, well known stock (underlying in the $20-200 range and a somewhat jumpy chart) first.
I don’t believe that was it for tesla. Rise from the ashes teslatards. The statement will be made in the afternoon. Ride or die🦧
Should be before end of November. No date set yet.
PLTR looking good
Thank god I didn’t sell my pltr calls to fomo into TSLA
take profit and buy back in on a dip.  it aint gonna last forever
If you wanted another chance at the TSLA 10 bagger, now is the time
455 p  hmmm...
but you will
Robinhood keeps crashing every time my account turns green. 😂
They can sugma balls

My dad did 8 years for less than 100K of tax evasion. Cost the US 7.2 million to keep him locked up and alive
He hasn't even pumped it yet
Guys, please keep buying the TSLA $1200c 10/29 I’m selling. Thanks
Take the profittttt
What is so good about them and why aren’t they valued fairly?
They will, just probably won’t be this week

Dude I bought $50M worth of TSLA at $1090 , do I have to wait until 2030 to breakeven even with selling CCs?

Volume on the dump was about 9 million shares or $9B.
You should have seen when GME went from 500 premarket to 120 back to 350. Craziest ride I ever rode on.

Never seen a day trader that wasn't bald or on their way there
Gme retards celebrating a tesla dump because deep down inside, they know GME will never hit 200 again.

You guys are sad
Cheap? Lol it needs 20% to breaekeven
I think Tesla will go red, which usually means I’m wrong and it will go green, unless the market knows I’m doing reverse psychology in which case it will be red
Oh lord Tesla nooooo
I'm not sure what you are seeing here, my dude. This feels like a dead play

If the market is dumping because they think they’ll tax unrealized gains that’s even more retarded then dumping because they think they’ll not raise the debt ceiling.

Primed and ready to buy this dumb dip.
I think we're getting to the point where everyone only wins if TSLA wins. Invested in preprofit memes? Buy TSLA calls. Shit's boutta be like war bonds, buy tsla for the cause, keep the dream alive until taper 😂
I’ve gone skydiving before and that shit was nothing compared to playing TSLA options
Maybe GOOG too if they do bad on earnings today
Because people took profits
Dude, did you not watch cnbc. Cathie sold PYPL and bought SNAP with that money.
I mean.. they kind of got some stuff going on
Crazy to take the sidelines the rest of the day?

What jew mean by that?
I like how every few comments someone is trying to pump Tesla in here as if wendy’s employees have the buying power to move the price 😂
flip flops are disgusting to me unless they're slides worn with nice socks that are not white

slippers are the big winner in that comparison but i wasn't thinking about going in full lazy wear, i'm thinking about actually dressing decently just replacing the usual jacket or turtleneck with a robe i think it would be a hit
Dont Sleep on ME! Boys...

Any stocks under thirty bucks worth getting to sell covered calls with?
10 red candles on PYPL, someone grab the menorah
Don’t do that, Tesla has gone up like 20% in two days. Putting that into perspective, it gained $200billion market value in two days. And it was because of the rental car news with Hertz which is now priced in... The only way your calls will become more valuable is if Tesla releases more news (which it won’t, because it will tactically wait for price action to stabilise before doing that to avoid losing the news to the noise of fluctuations)

BAN for even typing this dogshit ticker that is only up 11.9% YTD
What the fuck are you doing, Asana?
#THETA GANG REPORTING
You bastard. Cheers!
So I’m pretty sure it’s almost always a bad idea to buy options on companies before earnings. The iv is really high before earnings and typically plummets after earnings which reduces the value of the contract.
Baba just continues to rail my asshole.
Same ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Out of everything I own except BABA leaps which will be fine. 

Tuning out for today. Will be back tomorrow to do some dumb shit like buy TSLA puts with 1/3 of my account again.
that was fucking ideal timing, very nice play. still can't believe IV was that low, makes no sense.
Can’t believe people used to put Facebook on the same level as Apple and Microsoft. Fuck this compny
Had that happen last week with PYPL.
What are bags? I just let my options expire worthless instead ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Bought some TSLA puts, the pump is over, at laast for now
This is about the finest introduction to credit spreads i couldve asked for

still holding this tsla call
Was pissed at myself for pissing away $20k in potential gains for not holding. Glad I took the profit I did now.
So whatever whale just dumped Tesla at 1090

What's to stop them just buying here again and running it back up and dumping at 1200 

What I'd do if had tens of millions to work with
I'm up 10% today?????? what?!?!?
Facebook doing a inverse V shape recovery .  Rip
Any news on dip?
Sold all my near term and snagged 2023 AMD and FB calls
PYPL is related to Facebook , don’t bother with it.
Halt downs are freaking me out as if bad news is coming
Not that bad, keep it up
Not your entire account with maxed out margin
Yea we can give you store credit minus 70% restocking fee
Wen are you yoloing on SOFI?

Spy is still up a half percent. Lol
I got whiplash with the sudden change in sentiment in here
I'm only down $8,000 today
My shares or the calls? I bought one underwater call near the top for a 20k loss. Holding the other calls cause I think it’ll fall more
Pltr stay strong
The daily lunch dip and everyone acting like the sky is falling.  When the MM boys finish their steaks we'll get back to mooning.
Next week, Precisely. Im loading spy puts on Friday
We're going to get some wild loss porn from over the course of 20 minutes
I have a significant amount of my account in it
Mannn FTCV gonna flyyyy

Diamond handling these TSLA calls I'm not scared bitches I sold yesterday at 1000 bucks just to see the same option is at 8k now I'm back at with another option brought me up 2k just to watch it fall to 500 I'm not selling .suck cock michael scary burry
You’re doing it right

My TSLA weekly $1200c has been a rollercoaster this morning. Fuck it, I’m buying more.
Ride the rollercoaster fuckers! Let’s see some volatility!
It’s only 11:30
Tf just happened with SPY? JPOW giving a surprise speech or something?😂
SELL OFF HAS BEGUN!!! Good luck everyone!!!
Spy FDs are the way to go, either +100% or -50%. Better odds than roulette
zuck do it now ZUUUCK
So this is what we get when Whales swim in a circle huh. Though it was a myth.
Go China bears go, all gyna stocks are going to zero for sure. I need discounts so do that thing you guys do!!!
😂😂
so was that just someone taking massive profits in SPY? i almost shit myself
So many people got trapped by Tsla and NVDA yikes
Sure.  You are part of the audience of emotion and feel good.  I will tell you what you want to hear.   Hope that makes you feel better
[deleted]
Actually nvm I thought I might have bought snap calls at the top but snap is way oversold holding until Friday
WHERES THE OFF BUTTON
Never said to break it. Just retest it
Drops like this on SPY remind me of why stop losses are worth it sometimes
Will TSLA rise again or should I cut my losses now on the 5x leverage?
Feels fucking fantastic to have sold the top for once!
that's literally never been true about google but keep believing that.
Bears got a chance to get out, bet 8/10 are holding those TSLA puts til worthless
Did you really write that right after -0.57 red minute candle?
[deleted]
I said it, tsla gonna bring pain to other stocks
Inverse... so that's a bearish indicator??
Is this fundamental analysis or something.  Don't think we're doing that for 2021
You should yolo everything into it then or get banned
It's 5:35 PM in geneva, switzerland, where WHO is based out of. By this time tomorrow, approval will be granted to OCGN and we see 20 by the eow. If you're still in after those two stop loss raids, congrats on your diamond balls. I shall join you in Valhalla.
Taking a look from the sidelines. Nervous money can tank this thing or buyers rocket it back up.
Guys, let’s not be greedy please. Yesterday was amazing and the first half of today has been great. Please take profits.

Still have 3 rentals that I'll probably sell this year.
What that's the first I've heard of this, do you just contact your broker?
Me, made $2000 yesterday, down $2500 as we speak
My stocks are all tanking. FML.
Even if it drops resistance seems to be at 55 which is a dollar higher than yesterday. Nowhere to go but up

Yeah if only I had level 3 options enabled..

Brokers took all my money and than said spreads weren't for me and disabled them

But if I was playing spreads I'd still have my money lol
Gotta thank them, they bought my shares LOL managed to sell the top for once

(Only half, other half will be sold at 2T)
Hey that’s what they said last time!
Everyone knew shit would dip Sept/early October. Anyone who thought it’d keep going was snorting too much hopium.
So you’re agreeing with Biden then lol. Twitter and Facebook suck.

Yeah crazy enough if I kept holding now, 4K would’ve evaporated go figure lol
Beat and raise is priced in man.
I went in for 20 contracts. I have a decent sized account but not big enough for that. 

Biggest risk I ever took and was only down ~2k due to terrible fills.

I’m not in the position to fuck around like that yet.
Wait what happened everything went dark?
Tesla weekly $1100c in the red now
If he did, that shit would be at 1500, not 1030

You guys can't even hold TSLA at 1090 until Friday so I can buy 0DTE lotto puts for guaranteed 50x+ bagger

I’m still down 100 as I bought a one month call last week but I feel it’s a fairly safe call. However I’ll add that I’m new to this and might just be really naive.
SPY ded next week.
Just look at the 6 month chart for $TTEK
If you’re asking about it, it’s priced in.
I bought 11/5 1100c’s. I should have warned you all.

It should be law that at minimum once a year we get vol like this on TSLA. The most ass clenching trading of the season. TSLA will always be king.
Road TSLA puts for a few minutes, could not deal with that shit. Down a bit on them and sold. I don’t even care. Still up a little for the day. 

May go 100% cash gang for the day and turn this shit off. Almost gave myself a heart attack.
F, when did the news for that come out anyway? Did anyone catch it Thursday then dump Friday open?
[deleted]
Only if you are a billionaire.
Good call. Obviously.
After all this time? Always $BB $SNDL
yup, great stock, tons of upside, easy play.
I bought snap calls at the top
Possible announcement on Thursday , bought calls today I’m banking on that lol
It skyrockets 25% in a week
so TSLA bigger market cap than FB now

and FB revenue 2.5x higher

balance sheet 100x healthier

FB around $300 should be a good entry
[deleted]
Getting greedy on my Tesla short by not taking losses and attempting to breakeven
Correct. They can’t get $15 minimum wage they will never do this.
Woke up for a bit to buy to convert some of my Amd gains to buy the tesla dip. Averaged down the 1100c to 17 ~ for two contracts. Let’s see if it works out or if I was bound to lose money anyways xD
Retail investors refuse to let this market die
CLF seems cheap. It’s busting out
Got a one month call last week. I feel it’s a really safe play but I’m also new to this
Yo WTF I just got price improvement on Robinhood. Halloween season is spooky af 👻💀
i've been thinking about this, i think tech, financials, and oil would be a good combo. the only way all three go down is if there's a massive everything dip.
[deleted]
You allocate too low a % to cash in your portfolio
If TSLA closes red god forbid do we buy the dip? 🤔
lmfao while they take out low interest loans against it and buy 100m+ mansions?

Haha when it was up 40% I smartly sold 1 call contract with a strike price of 15 for this Friday knowing for a while that if it actually did reach 15 I would happily Let It Go but most likely it won't. Locked in a nice $225 profit to lower my average down to around $8 now with the stock. Honestly at this point I'll just keep holding and then selling one covered call every time it shoots up 40% and continue to average down till it hits zero and then sell for whatever I can get.
Still red for me
no, its a 40$ stock
$ME is just getting started. Look at the volume the past month
Can't believe I missed these NVDA and TSLA insane runs. Congrats to all of the 100% gainers out there
Sell half, hold half
Theoretically it's the same as property taxes which you do pay on appreciated property not just what you paid.

Stocks aren't all that different in a general sense.
The urinal gamble.
Well any company that doesn't offer shares after a 600% run is stupid. What did you expect?
May this finally being down this bull market
It's for your protection
Please rise for the bagholders class of October 2021

🎺🎺🎺
Nah, what's life without risk?
I sold the 50p yesterday morning and even now I could still buy it back for a gain the IV crush has been so strong. Wild.
RIP Joe Rogan
345p on LMT 😳 please tell me one of you retards had em
10% on $4.8M 401K is better than 1000% gains on $210 in Robinhood.
FB just needs to follow suit
Get over 25k
FUCK YEAH SNAP BABY I KNEW I AINT BUY THAT DIP FOR NOTHING 👻👻👻🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
It's because I bought a 1090-1110 call spread. Never been long on TSLA in my life and decided to fuck it up for everyone else.
Yeah. That.  Haha.  You’ll be ok. You’ll have tweet and FB.
Those poor souls who bought 10/29 $1200 calls
Or calls in the morning
same, also could of loaded on 250c for nvda in the AM, they were like 50 dollars, i d went in msft and have made about $100 compared to like 5k lul
No one ever lost money taking profits.
google looking bullish....please beat please beat please beat
Who still uses Pinterest?
Whenever I want to buy a dip, the other stocks I have are also a dip, so I have to sell a dip to buy a dip.
tsla calls b4 close still the move?
I got my retards in paris and we're going gorillas

I wanted to buy calls on snap but got busy at work this morning. Fucked

Where my one month call Snapchat homies at?
Like if im taking profits, why are u stopping me
For the options fomos that a lot
No, but I'm a degenerate gambler.
Yup pretty sure it was on the same thing too
VIX climbing and SPY green? After a 5% pump in under a week? How COULDNT you grab puts?
Unless it's straight shares, just sell into a spread to lock in the gains. It caps max profit but it's a way to hedge movement when you can't daytrade.
Finna become a proud OCGN bagholder
Did Elon shoot someone at 10:45 this morning?

I’m hoping so!

Get rid of it now while there is an active market. Nothing worse than keeping it for 10 years with hope it will be worth more
MSFT deja vu vibes. Running up on the release day and tanks after hours. I should buy puts around closing time
PHUNWARE’s not so fun anymore :(
Day trading restrictions are fucking lame
Honestly 475 eow is not impossible. We need 3.7% gain for the rest of the week from right now.
PYPL playing games :-|
Crash crash!!
Is LCID delivery announcement priced in or naw?
why do i get feeling that Elon saying Buffet should buy TSLA is a hint to sell?!😂

Nah, I prefer to poop on myself while standing up

So 460c spy fds
have you used your PDT ban waiver yet? you get one free pass where if you are day trade or buy restricted you can wipe the restriction. or you could sell calls to lock in the gains and then close it all out tomorrow
Si!
Exact same with me, had a 950c queued up in Questrade and didn't pull the trigger. I'd be up $13k on a $500 bet right now
Now
If you have puts then yes, otherwise no
Cause of a 2% drop?
yeS
mrna you pile of shit
its still not fair you cant tax people for money that isnt theirs
Boomers would call a great *year* a 10% **annual** return. On here you blood thirsty fucking degenerates still aren’t satisfied after 1000% gains in a **fucking day** 😂 I love this goddamn place
No one can see the future (except the insider traders)
oh i know that. I've taken breaks from r/wsb bc i know it can fuck with your head.
Obviously
And yesterday was at 2 and I just looked at it
My calls are printing
Anyone else loading up on more CLF?
Clf good play for the infrastructure bill, although it has risen a little bit since earnings I think it still has a bit further to go. They had some really good looking earnings. Leaps aren't expensive yet either
Lmaao it’s only down like 30 dollars from the top

Anybody else hate those dumbass posts fishing for compliments? Like “oh I only made 1.5% gains this year.”
PDT and buy the dip do not work well together. all I want was to buy Tessy calls on sale compared to when I bought them.
everyone in here is just getting lucky, how could you have known this would happen last friday? but yesterday still would've been a great buy opportunity, that's on you lol
So pegged at 1050 now….cool

This is how i felt when i meant to buy calls yesterday morning and forgot and doubled down on SPY and AMD

Bought at open and up big tho 😊
Y’all ever sit on the toilet to let out a toot just to be safe 🥵
Ha, now we have TSLA bagholders!
just do it. what if after ER, you lose money?
I bought calls yesterday may buy some shares as well today

If it breaks 1100 it could move to 1300 quickly. What could stop it after that? Shorts are fukt

Thanks, MSFT!
200% is fat profit. If you want to see how high itll go, sell half and let the rest ride. I tend to be on the safer side and would probably sell the whole thing now.

who wants to catch the DWAC knife with me??!
and here comes my baby MSFT
Hide your TSLA gains from yourself in MSFT stock.
I’m greedy af but where does it end?
Hold til 0.
So you're saying I won't be broke soon?
I sold a 960 yesterday before close for 6k that was 12k today happens, profits profit man.

/u/ChefB22 (3/0) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1050.0 when it was 1082.54 and it did, congrats you fuckin nerd.

Yes but historically reality asserts itself at a certain point. Wild to see this fever dream just keep going on and on

What about after 2800%?
Definitely me.
Trying really hard not to dump my MSFT calls before ER, up 100%
I went from 292 to 2200 to 7500 to 13.5k on TSLA

Currently have 15 10/29 1200C bought at 7,12

So if democrats get their way on taxing unrealized gains, Elon will have to sell like $80B of Tesla stock?
holy shit the literal top. sorry to hear
Great to see TSLA in the 1050’s. We can easily close in the 1070-80’s. 💪
with lightning speed
No coffin please, just wet, wet mud
Take profits and sit on it for a week. See how it feels.
1200? you mean 1500
Your focused on NVDA and sleeping on TSLA
Guys look at the 1050 call. It’s wildly volatile. $20 minutes ago. $35 now. 


That’s where the money is. Any pull back, buy it. Sell at your discretion.
ahh the dreaded green VIX with green markets...time to buy puts
Who could’ve expected this horrible tragedy to happen to DWAC? Going up 500% in two days seemed so organic. Truly shaking and crying
Imagine not buying the Tesla dip 🤡
Pinche cabron
Anyone buying Google calls
Imagine buying a stock for a social media company that doesn’t exist at $150+. Woooh boy.
1100? Or 900? EOD thas all ima think about today
That dip was your last chance before 1200
Ok that’s enough of a dip AMD…time to face rip!
unbelievable.  Calls dropped 60% as i typed that comment.
DKNG's morning move was exciting until it stalled right back in that $50 pocket again. C'mon, do something for real!
Green on the 5 minute candle. Pump resumed 😎
Calling it now...DOWN day tomorrow.  Market is too ovehyped...TESLA, NVIDIA...etc...  Lots of profit going to be taken Wed,Thurs, Fri !  Prepare Apes ! Lots of LOSS PORN coming !
Also, Merck has earnings this week too! Not to mention the covid drug possibilities
Any mechanics here? How are Teslas in your opinion?
Either MSFT or AMZN or both are going to crush earnings but their stock is going to dump and start a mini fallback in SPY of 2-3%
Very unlikely
What’d you buy lol
You don’t sell Tesla

Glad I sold my tsla call for 700 before the clappening. Now the question is do I dip my hand in the jar again..
&gt; I've got some CLF and AMD on my watchlist.
Gotta take a moment to laugh at all the FB victory laps here last night.
Knowing Facebook it seems like more info keeps coming out, so I’m weary. Either way it’s a great investment, just be careful with options

Sell wall at 1100 is big
Facebook looking into the future of the metaverse is going to be so beneficial for the future value, why not catch the dip.. Right 😏
At least you’ve got enough money to have been short multiple Tesla calls. You’re doing better than 90% of the world probably.

Wtf do I do with my tesla gains I've never made it this far
to hold MSFT calls through earnings or dump before close🤔 (11/19 $315 calls)

True bro i need to buy more positions for EOY and this green is stopping me from doing it 🤣
anyone brave enough to buy the TSLA dip?
Yes, it would seem that standard chargers are going to be critical for the EV's to be successful.  We don't have specific gas pumps for each brand of vehicle today.
How the fuck PINS came back to where it was before rumor, and PYPL is not? Cmon gay bears, you had 3 straight red days last week based on the rumor and you still want more you greedy fucks? I hope PYPL shoots up so fast that you lose all the gains. SQ is up 26% YTD and PYPL is still flirting at the May lows? Comon this is PYPL the industry leader you are talking about!
It seems other stocks don’t like when Tesla is pumping, now that tsla came down pton is recovering
This may come as a shock but when an asset appreciates almost 40% in 3 weeks some folks are gonna take profit.
RIP 1100 call holders
I feel you i dont think alot of people thought a top was coming atleast for today.
I have been cash gang for months. And to think the play was to just buy anything. Stocks only go up I guess

None of what you said happened, but you definitely bought DWAC, the shirt, and the hat. Anyone who uses the word libtard is definitely a cultist. 😂😂😂
TSLA --  risk happens gradually, then suddenly
Someone always holds the bag and it's 100% always retail.
Yes I agree, leaps are worth it honestly 

And yeah, my failure allowed me to be better at trading so I’m glad it happened earlier on

Alright retards there is your $TSLA dip, if you miss this train again you deserve to wear a clown mask for the rest of the year.
Man think how many more thousands you would have if you used a stop loss 🤣
Nope, just has to hit the PT within the time limit, that’s the rule of banbets

What a plot twist.  People were bragging about their calls 12 hrs ago
Looking to jump on the run and ride it like a magic carpet
So does every EV have its own proprietary chargers?  If so we need to knock that shit down asap. Every manufacturers gonna have their stupid chargers everywhere. Just need to agree on 1.

Expecting a solid earnings based off what I read but I've been burned more than a few times by not taking any profits through a pre-earning run up
Institution believe this is frothy

Don’t be the bag holder to hold Tesla to oct2022
I was down 23k 

I got fucking ballsy 

I only bought back 2 of 4 so I got some back

I'm so fucking pissed idk why I did this stupid shit right in the middle of my vacation... Fuck

Sucks fam, you'll get it back
This is painful
DKNG seemed like a sweet play.. but its stuck in mud as usual mid day. Kind of surprising considering it was at $56 when the BAD news broke about the bid... so now that its a no-go... we should be going straight back to that price.
I am of full faith until TSLA dips red
I DONT TOUCH TESLA THIS ENTIRE RUN I GET CALLS IT FALLS 6% IN 20 MINUTES HOW
My booty hole is puckered for today's MSFT and Google earnings. AAPL later in the week.

Thanks for the tip, just sold my TSLA stock and used the profits for that
damn man quick on the timing for the massive dump, think the bet has to close in a week below 1050 though.

TSLA only up 2% for the day and before noon, and the 🐻 come out in full force.
Lol I bought 800 at 13.02. It looked like it was a nice little steady climb up, then all of the sudden... FUCK YOUR PURCHASE!
Bought at 1094, give me five ✋
You know that volume is from both ways right?
Alright which of you got fucked by that TSLA rug pull, admit it.
wsb transitioned from mango’s fanboys to musk’s fanboys
NVDA bby I love you but let’s hold 250

#HOLY FUCK WE RICH
It won't in a million years , you have to be retarded to think it will go ITM in 3 days , guaranteed Michael Burry will YOLO his entire 9 figure net worth to short it if that happens.
Been holding OCGN for a year plus been in profit twice, this morning was the second time, up 1.5k now down 1.5 after buying 800 more at 12.99… it seemed like a steal at 30 min ago 🤣
All in on OCGN! Let's ride this vax to the 🌚 🚀🚀🚀

Man I hope TSLA trade like this forever. 
Going up and down so fast like 🌈 bears behind Wendy's.

Done with trading for today. Today is not my day
This DWAC dip actually looks like a knife worth catching for anyone who missed the first pump. 🤔🤔
snapchat looking like a cup and handle, calls loaded
Finally someone said something about my Amex plat cars
I sold my call weeklies +1.4% at market open today after buying them yesterday AM (5x'ed). 

I was gonna buy puts when TSLA was +5% up or so an hour ago when daily rsi was touching 70, but chose not to for some reason.
i was looking at it 5 minutes ago at 500 a contract, it briefly hit 1k a contract 3 minutes later.
I was going to sell my calls at 1100 ... weeeeeee
Yeaaa but you won 150k last week so whatever
OCGN getting hammered by short sellers, I love it.  Bullish!
Let's reclaim some land tsla... Pretty pls
Use a limit sell, don’t market sell it unless you’re sitting on a ton of profit and wanna get out the trade immediately
Literally no one thinks that lol
[deleted]
This looks like it’s set up for a perfect V shape on TSLA
Check my comment history and see if it matches my prediction
What u do retard?
What the fucking fuck is fucking with OCGN? Why the sudden two trading halts?
Big volume on OCGN this things gotta bounce right
Yeah I think monthlies and LEAPS are the way to go if you can afford it. Or unless you're expecting a big movement real soon. I'm glad you found yourself in green again tho :) you learned and became a better trader.
That was definitely the top, get out while you can
Watch it work too lol. Market is nuts.
Look up the rules for halting stock

Then realize you’re a 28 day old shill account
Looks like that was it for TSLA. It tested 1100, going up to 1094.
Spy pumped to offset a bad jobs report. You’ve been warned
How tf do I unsubscribe from Robinhood sending me a new fuking email every time I place an order???

Might be stuck in a PnD with OCGN. In at 8.12$ so I have a bit of breathing room
I bought hood puts so calls are actually free money btw

Hold $AMD through earnings?  They are allegedly good, so it will tank right?
Percentage wise it means nothing lol. No way they halting that
RKLBW is extremely undervalued they should be going for like 12.50 per warrant and they’re valued at only 4.20

Figured it was worth trying to time the top on TSLA given that move to 1090 was being driven by 1100 call buying more than the stock itself.  Got out with a $4k gain and a lot of heartburn.

Pypl, the most frustrating stock at this very moment. G U H
Yellen says yes
"Buy OCGN they said, it's gonna pop they said."
Best chance to get on OCGN is right now. This thing could go nuts if WHO approves
Anyone know why ocugen just dropped when it was climbing?
today looks like it's stacking up to be flat af

Draftkings is undervalued by quite a bit now that they bailed on the Entain deal. Waiting forever the Ark massive buy in to pump it up.
This is the only dip you fuckers are gonna get lucky with dont just stand there operate
*charging up, TSLA doesn’t use fuel, remember?
Inverse WSB has never let me down, just made a free $150 off my spread. Now to take a fat shit that I’ve been holding in for the past 15 minutes
Tesla bringing ocgn down too wtf
watch that bitch bounce now
Sell those calls
Just bought 1080’s for next week. Let’s go TSLA
We have a trillion dollar company fluctuating 10% on no news. Lmfao… everything is so fucked

Guys once people in here start saying buy the dip the play is over don’t become like the GME bros
TSLA PnD LOL , who the fuck bought the top? Remember how long it took it took to breakeven for those that bought Amazon at the peak at the dotcom bubble?
fk man you did it
Sold the top and Tesla immediately dumps. I fucking suck at this game
but there for the grace of god go I
Buy tesla dip rn
finally a breather for TSLA
&gt; I am not surprised Tesla is dumping.
Did Elon say the N word or something?
If I didn't realize my tendies gains, did I ever have any tendies at all? 🤔
CLF - looks good
Lol nice, good thing I decided to sell my only TSLA call near the top today
Fuck everything else $TSLR is the way
PUT IT IN REVERSE TERRRRRRY
When all in on Tesla at the top, just sold for a major loss... Expect to bounce.
[deleted]

Who bought at top
That's an awful nice rug you're standing on there....would be a shame if someone pulled it!

Looks like TSLA is fueling up 🚀🚀🚀

Lots of TSLA resistance at $1069 lol if you haven’t figured out 69 is a key number for the company yet, here is your tip.
How much are you down right now?

Bought the dip at pinterest
Literally every play I made kept getting trashed on, non stop, but mainly it was last January when I dropped a lot on Tesla calls and then it went in a downtrend the rest of the year until now
[deleted]
Place a banbet then or buy calls.
Damn that rugpull was quick. Stop loss saved my days gains phew
Might have to sell a nut if I keep guessing wrong on SPY
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

WRONG WAY TESLA
I need TSLA to stay up til Friday but looks like that won't happen
Buy the tsla dip
tsla action seems eerily similar to beginning of February 2020
Options are cheap as heck still for draftkings. Easy scalp

DWAC finding support at 69.69
I just bought SPY and QQQ put to redeem my portfolio today 😈
hope so, looked like a rug pull just now
SPY moves in the first 30 minutes. then does nothing all day. then crashes at close. boring
Watching it sell-off
It's dead because they can renegotiate the terms of it, or issue 10x as many shares now, etc... There's nothing to protect buyers right now.
I took down Tesla 😈my money is burning with it
I bought a Tesla call and lost 200$ instantly wtf
what will you be doing when tesla reaches 1100?
By 2030, people will just buy the Nasdaq instead of the S and P, even for 401ks
🤡
Strap in for TSLA liftoff
Bags are pretty light, with a low average price.

TSLA GETTING HIT HOLY SHIT LOL
Remember everyone taking profits is for losers
Tech Check starts now……. WHOOOOOOOOOOOP
I think Jeff Bezos is in a board room somewhere yelling at a webcam
STOP BLAMING DWAC drops on "liberal news media"...they didn't force the nunber to drop.  Just take your losses and deal people
Well now that derivatives are available, you best believe it will be getting short fucked with.
Dump all your money in it, I dare you…pussy.
Puts on Tesla!
Yes fuck you PYPL.
Good, this smooth brain is all in on prog
Lol 11.90 not 13 but ok
i feel like tsla will close well over 1100
I was even yesterday too, -4k puts, +4k calls. Almost took profits on the call side but ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ so it goes.
I’d like to formally apologize to everyone I made fun of for FOMOing into TSLA after a +12% day yesterday. I’m a 🤡. Congrats and fuck you
Ah, red again. Just how god intended.
Says suspicion of being an alternate account, but have never used discord before so 🤷🏻‍♂️
SPY ATH? Time to buy calls.
BROADWALK EMPIRE VIBES
Sorry guys, I did that. Finally bought TSLA calls. The top must be in.
All in DWAC @ 69.69
&gt;here's such belief in the stock's ability to execute over the next 10-20 years

Which is reasonable, many watched Tesla literally crawl out of hell with the Model 3 production problems &amp; they project SpaceX's successes onto Tesla too. It's pretty much taken for granted now that Tesla is gonna continue executing like a badass. At this point the only thing that would crash the stock would be if Elon were to be assassinated by the TSLAQ terrorists.
The people selling really are gay
Finally above water on ASTS. Keep it going!
Are you me? Sold my 1010C 12/17 and missed out on about $6k. Still made a profit 😔, if only i held for another day. Sad but profit is profit.
SPY u better whip out another green dildo..i want my calls juicy n wet pls
Nope. It is utterly irrational. I expect a dump by the beginning of next week
Advanced Money Destroyer is gonna tank 20% after ER, right?

I would take profit on a majority at some point today and let a couple ride. But nobody went broke blah blah blah
You missed that everyone is greedy as fuk and no one cares about that stuff
i did it. i bought stupid TSLA 1150 calls.  i am sorry for the crash which will come momentarily
Looks like ARKK is breaking through resistance ...
DWAC CCS printing 🥭
Only losers think about missed gainz. Think about what you got in the bank instead! 😊

Imagine buying PayPal🤡
I am never opening a spread on TSLA again I had 5 heart attacks in the last 5 minutes and I can feel my hair going gray
CLF just slowly printing money teehee
Nvidia's blowing my mind right now. Got in right after the split around 180. Wish I'd jumped in harder.
All I ever wanted was that sweet sweet TAANG  

TSLA AMZN AMD NVDA GOOGL
Took all my Tesla gainz to GME shares.

Just don't go all in and take out some as you go. I regret not risking TSLA sooner. I couldve retired at 23 lol
20 minutes
Is that market crash in the room with us right now?
CLF just slowly printing money teehee
+30% on Spy calls today. Ready to lose it on a yolo tomorrow.

Feeling stupid, Calls on OCGN or DWAC???
Doesn’t the market seem overly positive this last couple of weeks. Did I missed any news about interest rates not going up or inflation going down?
**BET BAN IT HO3**
Yes, yes they will and will fight the hedge funds through and through
Username suggests your lying
Tonight
Super moon!
My NVDA 400c for Jan 2022 went from dead to green, love to see it.
I started out in the market buying calls and puts (blew up account). Then got into debit spreads  (blew up account). Then started doing theta gang and sold bearish call spreads on apple pre stock split  (blew up account). Then started swing trading growth stocks (bag held ARKs). I am now a disciplined dividend investor.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Buy more TSLA
Hope your put prints!
I like how the market selectively ignores bond yield movements. Like, a couple weeks ago it was all “oh
Boy yields going up, tech stonks get smashed” and now it’s like “bond yields up….Amazon up 2.5%”
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
They are cheap, worth the risk IMO. Look at the chart, should legup again.
Small cap season, IWM $250 eoy
You say that like you’re going to time the top every time. Impossible. Congrats on your profit.
Yeah I missed out on 20k hopping out too, still made 15k in a day tho. 

Take the win, I'm sure we've both been burned too many times
TSLA is an infinite money glitch
When TESLA 1200?
That was some fuckery with ocgn, bought more at the dip
Yeah, but they aren't as fun!
Back in 1923 my Grandma shitted on the kitchen floor and we retard grandkids skated through it.
458 SPY put for Friday. Gotta dip by then...right?
I'm Ron Burgundy?...
PLTR, Even when you're winning you're losing
What if TSLA surpasses AAPL by market cap? Wonder if people will just keep buying.
Glass half full?
FINALLY $DKNG is on the move up with that news
Bought some Fb dec calls for that meta verse announcement on Thursday, thoughts?
[deleted]
Had a $1 left in my TW account, bought a 10/27 467c. LFG!
Tesla will crash in a terrifying and horrific manner. Over 80%. I promise you it's coming. Please don't be stupid. The markets as a whole will crash over 50% before end of year 2022 GUARANTEED. Tesla will be even worse and go back under $200
What’s the word on SNAP?
I bitch to my wife when we go out and the dinner bill is $200 but then I’ll throw $5k into spy options that expire the next day without thinking twice
Well you win Elon. Last Tesla put I ever buy….
Lol
[deleted]
All the money is going to TSLA. :(
Let me remind you that I told people to buy as much TSLA as they could at $669. Now I am telling you that you should buy as much as you can again, before it does that splitting thing again.
I wanted to sell DWAC 50 puts, but TDA told me I'm not allowed.

I had to settle for selling PLTR puts again.

Fuck you TDA gambling dad, its my money, and I want to lose it all NOW!
I can’t decide if I should be happy I made a healthy profit on Tesla, or be mad that I sold too early.
I’m
Too bullish on intel, they have the better chips
That’s the Top!
Bro, I almost fomo'd into DWAC on margin, but I was too broke.  
I may be too retarded/poor, even for this sub.
Hood bout to moon tomorrow
Dumped it 2008 and never looked back
and went down....
I got scared and sold my tesla 1050Cs like a  🤡.

I've been fucked playing TSLA so many times I hopped out. I'll take my few thousand profit and be happy I guess... could have been 12k.

Atleast my 11/19 NVDA 220c are printing heavy.
No
I might just pick up more shares in old man stocks like F and GM. They're also moving into the EV space and already have the means to produce at scale. TSLA's valuation would be absurd to me at half its current price.
Same here, already down 🤡
Atleast my AMD shares are recovering about 30% of my Corsair losses each day
Bought 17 contracts, 50k of tska 1100 calls. How are my bags ?
FB on some fuckery. Drove their price down to buyback cheaper. I see ya 👀
too bad for my $55c.
🐸 making a W for Wombo gains
Literally in two days I made up for all my losses this last year so I’m glad. First thing I’m doing is setting aside some for taxes and paying off my debt
Or the last time you can buy it above $1000.
DWAC to $50 then blow off top to $500
&gt; The SEC halted trading on OCGN due to concerns over the company's accounting.
Well, if a stock moves more than 10% within a 10 minute span.
Literally had 3
Well Lost $1600 on $TSLA 11/5 puts 🥺I’ll be back tomorrow bishes 🤣
I figured out what I was doing wrong.  I wasn't buying TSLA at every opportunity
Yeah shorts are desperate... 31% SI.  Some probably need to break even at 6
Not sure but it happened lightning fast. At least she's moving again.

Take a lungful of air and laugh at the memory of those bears predicting the end of the world two weeks ago.
Bought the ocgn dip
The second I finally give in to this company and it's retarded valuation I just know it's going to crater.
Melt up today wow.
Y is vix going up?
Me2. Its so amazing. I would have never been able to do this as a teacher alone. 

God bless papa elon!!
Manipulation? Some sort of trading halt even though it was steady for 20 mins around $13.
Actually ridiculous how overpriced assets are right now. If I actually had money to spend I’d be pissed

Wake and bake is nice sometimes, however I find it seems to reduce the efficacy of the subsequent bong rips I take throughout the day
Got in at ATH on TSLA earlier in the year and emptied all through out the past two days. That was a roller coaster.
Same up 54,36%.you know when a casual 1250 FD brings in 180 in 10 min. Its a good day.
People who can’t read and think they are buying
This may be the last time you can buy TSLA for less than $1100

I mean, the IV on the option chain is basically pricing in like a 30% move.
Almost mindboggling to think about the amount of money in TSLA calls (and moving through them) right now.

Hard to describe but it does feel like this TSLA move is being driven by the calls more than the stock.

Calls are probably driving like 2/3s of today's move.  Just look at the volume on some of those FDs.

There should be a LOT more DWAC loss porn getting posted. You motherfuckers aren’t sharing it and I know it’s there though
I feel hd maybe a bit early.  Their earnings arnt till November. Their ath is 173 and your calls are for 190.

No going to sell today but thinking about grabbing a January 2022 or February call $300 or $305  strike
Dwac lets go!
I mean I got a little play money. Better than losing it.
thought that yesterday now i’m up 100% lol
How much is Elon worth now? 200 bil?
$DKNG just crossed critical resistance. I don’t see how this doesn’t hit $53 soon
percentage wise it’s impressive but not even close to enough to merit a halt

Because it’s not going up in short periods of time. It just climbs steady all day.
When puts
Hell duckin yeah
Lamestream finance media is taking about TSLA $2500 within 6months.
Do you want me to stick my dick in your ass cause I'm getting that vibe brother
Wake up, smoke a j, buy more NVDA and TSLA, repeat. It's a lifestyle choice.
fuuuuck OCGN
Mooning at a faster rate
My fuckin guy
TSLA up 40% in a month

"RatioNaL mARkEt" 🤡

do other brokers not have the $25k requirement?
Apple bulls going to fomo into Tesla… even apple is having chip shortage issues 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

LETS GOOOO TSLA
Wtf did you just say? Do you want to fight. Come! Mother%$cker you and me right here right now.
And you’re clearly not lying to yourself
INTC = worst stock ever.
Why is it that (insert like any stock really) goes on a mega rally and they get halted every 30 minutes. But Tesla goes on a $100+ a day leap for what’s gonna be two days in a row and it just gets to run?
trying to rush it? Too short expiry / too much leverage?
Elon took out a $500b loan against his TSLA holdings and is buying up more TSLA shares with it to then take another loan.

Infinite money glitch.
Puts on your portfolio
Thanks for the discount!

^\*Walter ^Bloomberg ^[@DeItaone](http://twitter.com/DeItaone) ^at ^2021-10-26 ^10:51:46 ^EDT-0400
How much did you buy?
so is intc no longer providing goods and servicessss orrr? cause its that or its massively due for a gap up
I said this yesterday… tsla anything eoy free $$$$
Trading halt OCGN lol  Dang
&gt; The dump is a result of the market. It's not because OCGN dumped, it's just that no one wants to buy or sell at this time so everyone has to wait for someone else to do something first.
Asked my buddy at BlackRock why it seems like the Black Friday deals this year are gonna suck, he says they're just slowly banning poors from participating in Christmas because there are too many bolshevik atheists
Dump incoming....
I’ll only panic once it goes above 20
So musk made 16 billion this morning
To date, still holding? 
Those bags gonna get heavy 🤡
🗣IT'S GOING DOWN!!🗣
TOS is terrible for mobile imo. great on desktop.
If TSLA hits 1700, it will be worth more than AMZN.

Bezos's legacy in shambles.
Trading halted on OCGN on Fidelity!  This is some BS!
I'm not mad and I'm not struggling 😌
Likely the cheapest $DKNG will be for a while
Thoughts on where Ocugen will be when it comes back?
bruh Elon making another 20B today
I'm so confused as well
Banks in more debt than ever and ATHs lol.  Bears need to eat!!!
I leave to take a dump and OCGN dumps? Da fuk?
Buying more ocgn fuck it
I know. Cashed out at 1025 and feel like I missed out.  It I put it all in Nvidia, so really it was a good call (and luck)
DWAC should no longer qualify for this site by Thursday.

You don't consider this mooning?
FOMO is real. All TSLA dips being bought fast
Tesla gonna trade between 1185-1195 before it rockets last 1200 straight into 1230
Do it. I did last night
Jeepers. Buy the dip OCGN?
same, realized an hour ago and went in again 5 minutes ago
Can't afford TSLA?  Try lcid, nio, xpev....the whole bunch are moving up.  You poors can get in too
Naw man. I’ll just go take a walk.
I'll keep a few, closing some out EOD.  It usually crushes earnings, moons premarket, then tanks at open.
Ooo look who’s mad now. Have fun struggling with rent 🤡
Good God, tesla has no chill
You guys member in March when tech was kill? I member
Glad I didn't hold through, got out even-ish yesterday
No
[deleted]
Well just bought poots on both the Qs and SPY.... could've just slammed the tip of my dick in a car door but figured this would be more fun....
I did, but twice
You 175 type of heavy?
PLTR wants to 🚀
Welp pdt locked on Robinhood. What’s better for mobile tos or webull?
Sell half to lock-in some gains
I locked in profit at the open, put in a little house money back in, all good
My guess is shorts went all the fuck out on OCGN and accidentally triggered a shit ton of buys. Fingers crossed
They say 1st trillion is the hardest... 10 days till TSLA 2 trilli?
damn... up 100k on my 12/17 tesla calls
Hate the Greeks sometimes.  My Orange man puts are only up a bit despite the insane drop in the past two days on share price.  Any other ticker would have given me a 1000% win.  I guess everyone knew this was coming.
They just give your number to the new guy tommorrow.
I only have $75k left

After TSLA breaks $1100 its mooning
anyone grab the $2 dip on TSLA?
wow guys finally really erased all my loses. thanks nvda and spy &lt;3
I picked up a SPY 462C for $2.91 on that dip

Got some really great earnings coming out, 

Im really bullish on SPY
It was almost EOD when TSLA passed 1000. It was in the first hour and half and it’s about to hit 1100
[deleted]
TSLA $1100c 10/29 was $800 this morning...now it's $3200 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
What happen!  Grrrrrr

I got up to get a drink came back and dropped over a point
I’d like to thank all the maga bag holders for helping me
What are thoughts on Google earnings after close? It's been lagging so it looks like a decent long-term buy just in general.
people that r selling OCGN are pussys
'bout to order up some TSLA with a side of VXX
IT AIN'T OVER YET
Why am I always in the right stocks but at the wrong time? Am I a misunderstood genius?
Mango to 0
SPY going up with the VIX. Definitely normal.
Nice.
don’t fomo into TSLA don’t fomo into TSLA don’t fomo into TSLA
NVDA milking my prostate
I remember when I didn’t buy $TSLA at $750 because I thought it was overbought.  Oops.
Sucks to be you man. And you think you know my finances? Thats funny too. Have fun being you
OCGN  halted, buy time baby
jfc TSLA is a beast  


If I had a position I'd sell $1200c for this friday and buy $1000p for next friday.
I sold yesterday. You’re welcome.
is it too late to fomo into tsla calls
OCGN fell off a cliff! That stock can NEVER hold gains.
Shit company. Always has been.
TEAM WSB, we are a target for account depletion, need to be a leader again and stop being duped, research, and setting the trend wins. Get the penis out of your brains!
I yolo'd FB twice and twice managed to break even
Yeah, as per the treasury schedule, the FOMC directed the desk to only purchase Tesla shares and bonds for the next month
Post that juicy loss porn
Vix low and flat stonks go up, vix up, stonks go up stops
Fucking literally bought OCGN  1 second before it started dropping. Fucking piece of shit
You know we’re in a retarded market when nvidia is worth more than tsm
Tsla 1200 by eow
Holy shit. TSLA is going to be my first 10 bagger.
WTH just happen.  OCGN lost 1.5pts in less than a minute
Elon cured cancer
Let's go MVIS
Facebook buy their hardware I think.
He's ok now, thanks.
TSLA is just retarded, I'm glad I realized gains but holy shit do I wanna say fuck it and go all-in again
If it’s good enough to screenshot it’s good enough to sell, that’s not the rule here right now
lol, like clockwork
Oh for sure definitely holding to see 1.1k and selling immediately prob
Bailed out at $12.50.
Or FSR. But both are a smart play.
Why? What strike ?
TSLA is squeezing.  100k vol already on 1100 calls.  Just straight up power buying.
No
Just tied up the one of the warranty service representatives phones for a few minutes asking dumb questions in hopes that it will actually get me removed from their list. Will report back findings.
You must not have been trading in March 2020.
Sure all of the above doesn’t really matter you’re still the dumb 🐻 who loses money but thinks they are “tHe SmArT oNeS”
They’ve moved from buying mortgage backed securities into Tesla stock.  Only explanation that makes any sense.
Here it is: 📉
Yeah, that's my though process too. I try and ignore the potential gains because dwelling on imaginary gains is a distraction but... Damn lol
My anus now belongs to Elon Musk. Thanks Daddy.
WTF?!
Did NVDA cure cancer? Whats behind this rocketship

Your argument is correct if you don't have fractional shares. Otherwise there is no difference.
OCGN halted $8 or $15 open
if It does I am buying more shares
RIP to all who sold yesterday
FUCKING DONIT TESLA. $1200.
Did OCGN not get approved

Its SPAC stock so the floor is 10$ (Google it then you know what I mean). I think it's not worth sell it at this price and I believe merger rumor is from Bloomberg so it's 99% accuracy. Probably just wait until the merger rumor get confirm/denied. If you look at the charts then you'll see there is 2x 18% bagholders. One on normal trading hour and one in Pre-market up to 19$ lol so I think most of them will avg down.
Amen

Musk low-key helped this along by saying "we don't have a demand problem, we have a production ramp problem". Once production has ramped, we'll see whether or not 300% of the world's population wants to buy a $50k car.
I just did prob rip
might really see 1100 before lunch.
I think Friday will be good time to load up on puts towards eod. Since I’m thinking that Thursday open will probably be better

what are your TSLA price prediction this end of this week? Growing more or going down?

I only put a little into Dwac and I’m a clown but I don’t think it’s done yet. Gonna see if mr mango supreme talks about it. Then moon again.
Im not good at this
It's a legit move for the most part, but there's such belief in the stock's ability to execute over the next 10-20 years that it's almost stupefing.
Are we unanimous with giving up on SPCE? bc I sure feel like selling with my 51% loss

SOXL is too weighted towards TSM…I may start considering rolling out after about 5 years.
Never underestimate the stupidity of the customer.
At this rate Tesla will be the most valuable company by market cap before 2022.
November 11th. Remember that date. All I’m gonna say.
idk. not necessary IF margins hold. High margins should attract competition eventually. and if the profitability comes down markets might turn out to be expensive.
buy AUPH you bozos
So you just bought at $1k

FANTASTIC!

Just closed my NVDA call. Waiting for another dip and gonna go big next time, wish me luck y’all

I remember my first blowjob.  Tasted terrible.
you fuckers downvoted me ytersday when i said TSLA will have multiple 100 days. get fuck. Its still gonna happen. well prob be at 1200 eow.
Thoughts on lucid finally delivering cars? November 5th $30 calls?
the hertz deal is like giving a free test-drive to millions of potential future customers. And after those potential customers sit in the cheapest Tesla available (after hundreds of other people have eaten Big Macs in it, slept in it, gone to the beach and gotten sand all over it, shit themselves in it, and had sex in the back seat) they're gonna march right up to their local Tesla dealership and demand to buy one of their very own!
I've been on wsb since the March 2020 crash.

I've had so many fucking opportunities to get into TSLA. And I did, but then I sold.

Why am I such a bitch.
Yea I was shocked. After the Ackman shitstorm they are still thriving. Makes no sense.
If wish is recovering.. Corsair is next 🤷‍♀️
It's TSLA. It's been making bulls rich for the past 2 years. So glad you made it :)

Watching TSLA the past 2 years has gotta be how people felt watching tech stocks back in 1998-1999.

Someone needs to do a test to see how huge gorillas and chimpanzees can get by having a workout regimen
Ur mad
I’m gonna nap and hopefully wake up to OCGN $20
this reminds me of when tsla pre split want from like 650 to 990 and then dumped to 750 ish in I think Feb 2020. that one was right after earnings too. Earnings on weds, small move up thurs-friday. leap up Monday and Tuesday. that time it dumped right before the close Tuesday. very similar price action.  but yeah too scary to play.
I’m bullish on green beans with the holidays coming up
pretty obviously but it goes up more each day!
Honestly I have no clue what caused the price increase. I'm debating whether to paper hand it now.
It’s goin down

Congrats they went bankrupt

Yet still insists 

On TSLA puts
me too man, me too, but I think that train is dead on the tracks. As soon as they announced the merger with the Trump social medial company it tanked hard.
Possibly. I sold a 10 put for 11/5 for 150 bucks as a test.
(those are GME people btw)
The problem is the candles eventually turn red and when they do you’ll wish you had that boring job god being responsible is so gay
I'm taking profits fellas, it was a fun 10 day rally.
People asked the exact same thing when it was $300, $400, $500, $700, $900, $1100, $1500, $1900 pre split...were you even here in WSB during that time or just have a short memory like a true autist?
Thank you Elon! For giving us gains to buy your cars for free!
TSLA hitting 1250 EOW
Remember kids

$NVDA = NeVerDownAgain  
$AMD = AlwaysMakingDollars
Earlier I said I was up 22K on the day. I lied. I'm up 34K. What is even going on???
Dear DWAC deniers...  Up 575% in a week and ONLY down 25% today.   I seem to remember much BIGGER drops in GME and AMC before the true MOON.  I ,for one, am buying the dip !
What if TSLA pulls back tho
Just sold a Tesla contract for a cool 600$ ... Lmfao the fuck
Possible split announcement
I have it charted as an “ascending candycane”
OCGN with higher highs and higher lows. You've been warned.
RSI is high but I’ve seen higher on tesla
I know those empty nights get lonely

Sometimes you feel like you're the only one, to lose more then he wins

You have been trolled by Dwac, enjoy. Best short going.
ESTC holy shit 🚀
Yeah I’m confused
#DWAC IS LIKE

#DROP IT LIKE ITS HOT, DROP IT LIKE ITS HOT
I agree with you. But looking at the data, 5 years ago, if you made 50k, over the average of the country you should be able to afford 300k.

I guess your mileage may vary by location.
AMD gang, you guys holding calls thru earnings?  This is getting a bit ridiculous
Yeah ur on drugs

Love that flair lol
Sorry for your (future) losses.
Already have it 🙏
I have BENE at 15.90 when do I sell?
F
Yeah. I set my time horizon out 4 months, cause I don't expect SNAP to recover till then
🎶Don’t bring me downnnnn🎶
VIX says no.
Alright, cocky trumpers from days ago. Time to pay the piper and show that loss porn. A lot of talk Friday and over the weekend. Don’t go quiet now. Pay the toll. Post it.
&gt; I'm not full retard, I just have a high IQ.
It may just work. I can already see the headline “MSFT buys 500k Teslas”
Tesla is still going up apes. It's gonna hit 2k
I think we see 1200$ by close
Yep buying more at every opportunity
up 70% on my LCID position

feels like Feb again. almost.
RT data
phones that were 800 bucks 2 years ago are now 1200-1500

prices on everything have been jacked up to compensate for rising costs

i nearly had a heart attack looking at what upgrading my phone will cost, fuk that shit
Wait , did nvidia cure cancer or something?
IF TSLA IS 1 TRILLION, NVDA CAN BE 1 TRILLION!!!
Yep almost 2.2 k a month on pills for me every single month was completely broke every single day shit sucks bro
###$600-&gt;$12k thanks NVDA $260c 10/29
Lol
I see PLTR is still on that $25 run up to $26 it has been on for the last year.
Meet me in the mall
Ok.
Jesus you really went full retard, huh? That's way too OTM
Well I could’ve had 3k instead of 1,500 so I can’t complain too much. 10k is still a fantastic amount, but 80k yeah that would’ve been amazing. 🥲
I'm guessing there's some insider info being leaked about NVDA?
I’m debating this now. I have Jan 2022 1300$ calls average cost 2.90
Okay $NVDA you're allowed to copy us, as long as you lift us TSLAtards up.

Profit is profit baby! Congrats
I need all them mango-lovers to start buying DWAC rn. My options are sinking
Where? Spy and tsla still green
Strategy of buying LEAPS on shitty memeable deSPACs has netted me a pretty respectable 50% gain this month. Time to open a call credit spread on TSLA and lose it all
The announcement is tomorrow (supposedly) already made money on the current trade, rinse and repeat as needed:)

Shot through the heart (DWAC), gives Love a bad name.....back to $9.00 toads.

W.H.O. Approval is apparently coming within the next 24 hours.   
There is rumour that they are negotiating higher profit % deals with Bharat for sales of Covaxin (adenovirus vaccine) in Europe, and there is some level of evidence that Canada will pass is after WHO approval.   
Also, there are around 100 million Indians vaxxed with it, and WHO approval would be extremely important to help get the FDA moving on it as well to enable Indian workers to resume their economic march that is so important to a lot of the world.
Bought spy calls
Oh I'm down a ton in the market but still better than spending $200 a day on smack
Nah it’s not fuck that guy SPY 500 eoy
Must be a lot of new fucks in here thinking they'll buy TSLA puts and be successful. Remember last time TSLA had this run up? Oh yeah it split. Tf you even thinking
Way too low

Lock in your NVDA gains bois. Get 270C for earnings if there is a dip
Lmfao we hitting 460 before Friday ?
I‘ll sue.
The way it’s moving right now has me feeling like investors are just about ready to spring it again. It’s been hovering for the past few minutes now, but that happened yesterday too.
That is the sign
Ha. When you find out tell me.
Sooo wrong, bye money
Straight up. Boring meetings that pay my bills or sexy green candles, I can't decide
I made so much money off weed stocks. Made a good amount off DWAC too
 Gotta get out early when you are up on these meme stocks.
If anyone wants to buy TSLA puts, I'll offer you a straight -50% Vs the -100 from your put, let me know
What price did it split at last time? Like 2000 or something? I can't remember
Either 1200 soon or 900s soon.
Pussy?
We’ll see

fucking sell
gotta remember too that tapering is still QE

were going from excessive printing to slightly less excessive, but still excessive printing

markets will be in lala land for the next 4-6 months at least since the printers are still going to be rolling
Do we know when the bull run is scheduled to end? I'd like to be cash gang when that happens this time, and not tits deep in calls.

I sold my weeklies at the top before that dip. Holding my november calls though. nice 2.5 bagger.
I hope WSB comes away golden and Trump walks away even more broke than before.

And I don't mean you or me or your whore sister on OF.

I mean median of the united states.  

I am surprised like last year, 6 years of salary = price of a home.

ngl, been reading all the gain porn and feel so fucking jealous but congrats to all the apes who made life-changing money this past week
Everyone was complaining yesterday TSLA calls were too expensive while dumping their whole portfolios into rotten mangos.
I bought SPY calls before the this bull correction, and puts week before last. Went from 70k to 5k in three weeks. Irrational longer than solvent.
It’s absolutely impossible to work a 9-5 when you’re making $10k+ a day in the market either I need to get fired or the market needs to chill I can’t do both
How high can AMD go today? Should I sell my calls

ATM puts a couple weeks out might be the move?
I really don’t even know what to do now.
If it wasn't for Tesla calls, I'd be down bigly. MSFT calls, snap calls, tigr calls all too late lol
It takes a man to admit his mistakes. Kudos. Better than the thousands of bag holders he created.
I got in for 1.20 per contract, out at 8.50 something.  Not quite 800%.  I was just looking at the last few ticks before I sold.
Just buy anything. How can you lose money?!
We said if you don't got Mojo Nixon then your store could use some fixin'
&gt; You're greedy
Not for us peons yet anyway, too sure of a bet for the little man
Gonna hold that SPY 452.5P for one more day in case market has a sneeze... probably  not
What’s your cost avg
Vix moving up
Man oh man, Tesla gonna split and it’ll 10x again
[deleted]
Corsair has been the cheapest stock on the market for over 6 months….. and it’s still getting cheaper… wow
TSLA what you can afford
Spy calls are up 400% in the last 2 days
Mans said one last hoorah before tapering
[deleted]
&gt; I'm not a fan of either company
Am I greedy for not selling TSLA at %100 profit, or does this gravy train have no breaks?
How tf is anyone losing money this past week? I literally sold and I’m still up😂
Smh
DWAC holders the new apes. Lmfao
I mean saying bears are quite cuz you have a life yet you’re commenting on the daily thread like you have no life. So which is it?
Fml for DWAC
jokes aside, I'm too pussy to put 6 figures into one position
Pretty much every other time TSLA was this overbought in terms of RSI/MACD it had a quick 5-10% correction the next couple of days.

And yet, puts are probably the scariest thing to buy on that stock.
DWAC

DWAC

I don't own the stock.

D W A C
Ban bet already in my guy
I’m balls deep in Tesla puts. Mark my word dump is coming in 30 min. Load up!
I was a homeless drug addict 6-7 years ago so things can get better quick if you switch from drugs to only gambling
Well someone is going to be bagholding TSLA for awhile for the fundamentals to catch up to the valuation when the momentum stops and it won't be hedgefunds.
Well, I never got in Tesla, but at least Tesla is making my Nio moon.  
On the other hand, Baba is shitting the bed so hard. I expected a decent recovery in anticipation of singles day, but it looks like my calls will expire worthless.
Damn DWAC... Trump scamming me again post-Presidency
Seriously, otm fds are PRINTING
Lol $UPS smashed earnings while $FDX blew it a couple weeks ago
How the fuck… lol
Time for Janet Yellen to say something stupid.
TSLA blasting through Fib resistance 1050/1080 like nothing 

EASILY GOING TO 1200
Anyone that hopes people lose money is a piece of shit!
How wtf literally so green
Right? Stocks jumping 2% to 10% on insignificant news.
after the bell today
PLTR ripping hard
Or you’d be poor poor
SPY stock price too low imo
Mine too
This isn’t even a bubble anymore. This is fucking fantasy land
I don’t have enough moolah to lose atm
[deleted]
Lol watching DWAC crater is hilarious. Unfortunately IV is through the roof and there's no shorting yet available for the ticker, so not any decent way to profit from it.
That $3k gonna go far!
Only rent free because y’all be sleeping on the sidewalk with those DWAC bags.
They are protecting you from getting stuck with shares.  No put price is low enough to avoid it.
Yeah sold some, letting the rest if i need to avg down
Yeah I could be ok swing trading but I'm in poor people land, PDT
My Nov 1 Calls printed nicely I’m done for the day $$
Your honesty is greatly appreciated and respected
Sure, in an economy at large. This is the stock market specifically. Everytime you sell at the top, someone else holds the bags and your gains are their losses.  
It's not a zero sum game, but that doesn't mean that everyone will get their share. Even with infinite pie, if some people constantly take other people's share of the pie, those people still get no pie.
So, now that we are in market euphoria mode, the crash is probably next Monday, isn't it? Like these good times are usually the harbinger before the shit show
Still massively erect from 🥭 puts
Puts on $HOOD for no reason other than being a bitch
Yeah they wouldn’t let me either but I’m glad looking back. I woulda got beat up on em so far
If you don’t have a broker that allows for partial shares, for example a 10-1 split would take a $1000 share to $100. More affordable for retail investors that can’t buy partials. I know they are worth less and valued the same but TSLA may continue the same trend. But since your an expert please explain how they work. Again the point is for retail investors that can afford to buy in now.
it's your money to burn after all.
Too late 😔😔😔
Imagine Tesla decides to pull a Facebook and buy out every other EV company 😂😂😂
Down 30% today I need a play to save me
Most of their money comes from laptops and servers. If their processors fall behind AMD, they will lose a ton of revenue as everybody will start using AMD instead.

I haven't done the numbers on it, but that's the way to think about it.

If they can catch up and pass AMD then they are very undervalued right now.
I hear ya baller
just $500 more to join the 6 figgy club.  cmon TSLA 1150C
if TSLA splits, I'm dumping my net worth into shares.
REMINDER. PYPL down 9%+ still since the PINS non news lolol
Lmfao assumptions
Is balls deep $300?
Where the guy yesterday that said he couldn't help but buy 800p
The moon
I always get a little nervous when the market is this greedy. Nvda up like 8% on some analyst upgrade with no new info and the Tesla hertz thingy. Adding like the entire market cap of Costco to the market value. 🤷‍♂️

Thank god for spy
Instead of telling me not to panic buy toilet paper during a pandemic fucking fix your market, with your absolutely insane FOMO
While you guys are making money with TSLA, I’m here losing money carrying these DWAC bags
They had a red day on 10/19 unfortunately that broke the streak, before that yeah it was like 10+ in a row.
Lol imagine shorting SPY at 446 a week ago because “tEh rEDz nOt dONe!!! rEeEEe!!!”

Sold my 10/29 1050 Tesla call for 3.5 monday after buying it at 1.48 last week. Worth 5k now. What was I thinking

Wow look at OCGN’s option chain. Implied move is 45% for this week wtf!! How can I benefit off this??
I think wsb still hasn't gotten over the PLTR PTSD
Big agree but senate is pushing through some huge bill apparently and apple just allowed leafly to use order options on their app in legal states. Again not certain whatsoever I’m not even gonna play it, just a hunch
Zen.
itll go back up but it might take a bit. that was a massive fall and earnings were meh.
Sell it when you hit a profit you’re happy with. Alternatively you can set a stop limit to ensure you get a certain profit and see if it keeps ripping. Congrats, and remember the first one is free 👍🏼

I sold this morning on that bump realizing I had too much capital tied up for not much potential even if it ran to 310 again. Thought it would bounce harder at denial of PINS deal.
hold during QE sessions only, sell when QE is gone (or about to go away)

its too late to buy in atm because QE is supposedly on the way out

just go all in on next QE session and you're good
There is a boomer on CNBC talking $TSLA valuation. We have been past that for a while now. Move over retard.

Monthly RSI is over 92. It’s def going to see a decent correction once some of the closer dated options start expiring. My best guess is it will correct back down to 900 in a few weeks.

UWMC. It’s something, or it’s nothing, but TA looks bullish, just hasnt lifted off just yet.
Facebook will pop back up soon after people take these tech earnings profits. This week has sucked so far for it but I think Friday will be good.

Jump in people. Even if we dive to hell tomorrow, the ride in the present is a lot more fun if you are on it. Edit: Actually scratch that we might have hit a peak.

I sold out. Said fuck this
hoping TSLA keeps this momentum
Very logical considering TSLA is way overextended. Too bad TSLA defies all logic, so RIP to you 🌈🐻
it gave pretty obvious signals that it was about to go down too, i dunno what to tell you if you're still bagholding an obvious scam.
# BEARS LMFAOOO
Bought more here, but it’s pretty spooky this high up

My research is even dumber than this sub.
I want to sell $1450 covered calls on my Tesla because it seems like free money...but I'm terrified it might hit.
It's being shorted like fukn crazy
I love easy mode
Yeah everything else that I play I end up losing lol, spy has treated me well though.
Wait til a taper announcement
I'm concerned for SPY...

&gt;If you have an erection lasting more than four hours, you need emergency care.
SDC potentially going stupid today
The fact that TSLA hasn't seen an epic dump whenever it stalls is bullish as FUCK
it's going to be unbearable listening to all the future millionaires talking about how they studied teh stonk market when they were younger and always beliebed in Tesla.
I keep rolling spy calls up lol.
How we feelin bout PLUG?
Why do TSLA and NVDA just fuck so nice and good like?
NVDA to the moon? 🚀🚀🚀
I have SPY 500 LEAPS for Dec 22, if it hits 500 this November, I might be able to retire soon after.  130 contracts averaging $4.48.  They are sitting at $13.65 right now.
What a nice change for my portfolio!
Tard
I go long
When Tesla crashes, it’s going to hurt us all
all i can say is dont fall for the pltr spam, shit will drop like a brick at any given moment and not move again for days til your theta evaporates
After hour earnings, please tell me a ticker and call/put. Thanks.

Ban bet?
SHOPPING LIST, buy...oil stocks, nat gas stocks, fertilizer stocks, grocery store stocks, camping and RV stocks, per safety stocks. What am I missing here.........?
i disagree. i think NVDA is totally detached from reality and has been for a long time.
That’s rough buddy
does ANYONE have recommendations of stocks not related to TSLA or pump &amp; dumps.
Looks like you won't lose your banbet!
I read somewhere they are going to be used via fb metaverse
Wow DWAC was just a pump and dump all along and you should’ve know that by the 1000% gain that it’d go down in like a day? Shocking shit
YEEEEEEEE
top 50 or higher for sure

PLTR calls
Boys do I buy Friday 460c or what
[deleted]
Let's go Cliffy!!!
At least you didn't sell Tesla calls yesterday 🤡
This will only increase tesla due to ev kick backs
So PLTR is pumping and we just aren’t going to talk about it
If SPY closes above 460 today I’ll jizz me wankers
BIG DICK PLTR ENERGY
PUMP TESLA
We're in the middle of a euphoria type of spike right now, even VXX is going up with this move (probably people hedging with SPY puts).

So many stocks just rocketing atm.
NVDA with the big brain move. To increase profits they just decided to increase MSRP of their product by 100%.

FLASH SALE! 1 FOR THE PRICE OF 2! IT'S ACTUALLY IN STOCK, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD YOU GOT IT SONNY.
SPY is going to hit 500 by end of November. I have faith in Pappa JPOW 🙏🙏🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Of course, everyone is waiting for a stock split announcement. Last time it was announced at $1374, which means current holders are waiting to reach that level. Don't expect any selling before that.

AMD fucking
Imagine thinking people care about technicals or fundamentals anymore 😂
NVDA and AMD are in a hulk cock contest
NVDA is Skynet. It will not be defeated
I think TSLA strength in the fact that no one wants to sell
Still idiots.
Team Nvidia, AMD and TSLA is so crazy right now lol.

A lot of brokers now allow you purchase partial shares. No reason for a high stock price to keep you out of companies you believe in.

TSLA is insane right now though. Be careful!

Will TESLA hit 1200 ?? But will it really tho

Sorry, I have no bags of this junk to carry 😁
I said 10 bill, not billion.  Lol
The market just keeps going up. Nothing seems to stop it
Omg, can't believe Tesla FDs are printing. Was down 1k per option yesterday, 3k swing in the AM, and up 2k per option now. 

Never doubt Daddy Elon.

It still has the lowest PE it’s ever been at btw, no one understands that it’s growing exponentially. It’s a better buy right now at 1000 than 700 in january

The concept of social media connecting people and driving culture, business, and communication isn't limited to a single company. The original wildly popular style of social media like FB/Livejournal/MySpace may be dead or dying, but social media is a much broader umbrella.

Social media has a fate tied to mobile devices. It's just a part of humanity now.

PLTR quietly melting up
Well yeah, i believe tesla isn't worth more than 50bn and elon musk is a cult leader. But the stock market has nothing to do with reality. So why not get some money while i can? I will sell TSLA soon though.
Elon turned my $750 into $8k 🚀
It already went to another galaxy in 1 day (1600%) , more gains in 1 day than PLTR can give you in 10 years. You are just retarded if you didn't get in at 10.xx .
was down $700 yesterday and just made it all back via tsla fd. thx daddy musk
It’s more than double that now Mr. Mod
We melt up
Maybe toss a stop limit on there

UVXY immensely POWERFUL
What's the consensus on AMD earnings? Holding Nov5 $125c. Put my TSLA profits into the calls but now I'm thinking I'm being greedy.
Imagine the size of unrealized gains on those Nancy pelosi  Tesla calls

Everything dies eventually. Even long term fads
hooray for AMD, not invested myself but i like the stock. in and out of tsla today, made 10k feels fucking amazing how the hell do i just go to work after that
I would have a fucking heart attack with this votality everyday I can’t even sit still
Be happy you hopped on, at least. No one ever lost taking profit.
that's not low, it looks a little above average to me.
HOLD OCGN GUYS TOMORROW SKY IS THE LIMIT
SPY
I’ve been trying to find an answer, all I can see is it’s speculation on fb investing into the meta verse and that they will buy chips from
Nvda. My only other thought is news leaked to the big boys that the ARM deal is going to go through.
Why is it shorted that much then?
...that your parents dropped you on your head
At market open? That was me. I appreciate it.
Check OCGN
GME slowly but surely going up 😮‍💨
Ah yes, the first trillion dollar company that trades like a penny stock. Amazing times we’re living in
if it does that will be insane, it's way too good and I'm actually concern about this bubble. One bad news people might panic sell and drop to 900
Keep pumping TSLA or keep it there until Friday. 0DTE put lottos is going to be fun
It's "I hope we never part." Now get it right or pay the price
Social media is our culture

While the markets are at all time highs and inflation is highest it’s ever been while the great resignation takes place while the debt ceiling has been reached while the markets being pumped and dumped everywhere while the list just goes on and on

See you on the other side
TSLA made so more Bears fucked today, along with Theta gang.

Love to see it.
Sold my TSLA calls too quick. I was too excited for a win 🤦
Lord it's the same old tune, fiddle and guitar

Where do we take it from here?
PYPL is such a shitty stock
I have positions, I'm just not getting anymore today.
He was only four hours away, lucky
I guess the facebook buyback smokescreen didnt work so well
People are less dumb  nowadays
And here I thought my Nov 5 calls were long-term
A $40,000 investment in TSLA 2 years ago would be worth $1,000,000 right now.
I thought I got into Nvidia late at 208...boy was I wrong

I’m buying astr. It’s a gamble but if their rocket makes it to space this week the stock will do the same. Only about $9 a share right now.

I’m still holding regardless because it’s gonna print in the long run

it's debatable wehter it's a miss or not, which i think is why it's zigzagging.

How is anyone getting any work done during this wonderful time
Tesla puts soon ?
All I ask is that it goes off and I get big bucks. That’s all. At this point that hope is like an emotional crutch.
TSLA is so overvalued, I own like 5 shares, I will hold, this is gonna pump to 1250 end of week lol
I still own AMC, bought back into GME and TSLA. What's your point?

I did this morning and I'm still up 100% on my one call lol
Yep. Fomo
TSLA this entire week is only rocket ship
I think I’m only holding until later today. Can’t risk it gotta take profits but want to see if it actually hits today lol
If it does drop further, it likely won't be below $320
I'm glad I didn't follow the rules and held TQQQ options overnight last night.  I'm Just mad I paper handed those bitches and only made 2k.

Bro stop losses are the biggest scam on earth. Your broker sees them, and the HF buying the order flow data also sees them. Thus they can easily create a fake dip with their algos to target the most painful stop losses, have them triggered, watch the sell-off and then buy back.
So adorable.

I know but Elon will see it.
Me too and I’m a guy oops
Retard boomer stock
you'd have to do the math to figure it out. basically there's an expected move, and if it doesn't go up more than the expected move you lose money. Basically in order for this to work out for you, not only does apple have to beat, they have to beat big, and then the market has to also decide that that big beat is a reason to pump the largest most inflated stock in existence even higher.
Sold Tesla calls too early, am crying lol
my GOOGL calls are quickly being faded away reeeee
20$ EOD
This fucking crazy market holyshit can we get a red day please goddam

We're hitting $1100 today for sure
The TSLA people have gone up like 30% in 5 days wtf
Sold my TSLA 12/17 1100C and swapped with 12/17 1240C yesterday is the best decision I’ve ever made
WTF is going on with PYPL. My calls are down 50% this is fucking painful.
Just sold my SPY 450c to lock in gains. Now to wait for a dip….
Good on you! I hope I had remembered when I told myself to buy some a couple of months back :(
IT WONT STOP!!!!! 

TSLA !!!!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
If you didn't know this was a shit meme stock started by a moron, you will be left bagholding like all the other chumps. You have to play it like a rocket that runs out of fuel and gets refueled, all the spikes and troughs.
Tesla should be renamed from $TSLS to $ATH
TSLA makes me feel alive
Literally making money on a TSLA weekly $400 otm this is nuts
Last week I sold a fee TSLA shares to get better calls. Fucking glad I did
In the $1 range and closed around $1.60
guys what's happening to DWAC i'm scared
PAVE THE ROAD OF THE GAMMA RAMP WITH THE BLOOD OF THE BEARS OCUFAM!!!
No one got scammed that didn’t deserve it
Tesla’s volume is at 10mil (avg volume is 19mil) and it’s not even 10:00. Lots of growth happening!
Get ready to see a huge dip in Tesla because I’m about to buy
Meme stock. Welcome ex fellow bag holder. I did that run last spring and was disappointed also.
Tesla 1100c was a 10 bagger for me just locked in profits

Lol we are getting pretty close to the top
Had some many Tesla weeklies last week
It's like the universe is conspiring against to keep me poor. SEcond time Robinhood restricted me from buying those TSLA calls...
&gt;Their calls rocketted since this morning.  Good sign

Thank you TSLA sir, you continue to oblige
I’ve been playing like a gay bear for too long these past weeks. I’ve decided I’m finally going to be normal and bought some TSLA calls.
They have to split the stock… 

No way they dona share offering… right?
Nah, my family is not excited about ME. They don't know it's gone up 20% in the last five days or about their purchase of Lemonaid Health.

Imagine shorting TSLA 🤡
TSLA gonna throw in a free Tesla bot with every 10 bagger.
I can help with that
Bro chill
Not enough
Bruh I’ve been sitting on 440 10/27 spy calls since the 12th. I don’t care about the money you’re losing

Edit: wrong post meant to shit talk the bear but ya idk man you do you. You played with the spice gotta handle the heat
How much where they last week?
So IV crush...even if AAPL goes to say $155 after earnings, these calls might still lose value? Is that how it could work? I bought these calls on 9/30.
Imagine selling Tesla a month ago. Oh yeah. I did 🤡
WHAT THE FUCK UPST. One dowgrade fucking -6%
Bro chill
those who copied Burry's investments must be in shambles
Y’all can’t let me keep yesterdays gains, can you?

DWAC puts were legit free money
Is UPST dead now..? Or buying opportunity…
Nah, it's just undervalued.

Looks like TSLA is going to need another split soon lol
For tax purposes only, he don’t care.
Just be sure to throw your socialist friend, George Soros, into that category as well.

Hater.
Try this gambling thing, but for a few more “years” then come back to me
Speak for yourself im up 2000% lifetime.  This is what happens when you have patience and due diligence and not investing in fucking prog and clov
The TSLA $1K weeklies were just $1.60 2 days ago. Now over $70, mind-blowingggg
How's everyone feel about MSFT ER? Have 35 Jan 300 c's, cant decide if I want to bail or let them roll, up about 75% on them

No. You are.
Elon is a freak of nature. I'm still convinced he is an alien sent to earth to guide humanity towards being a sustainable energy species.
What if profit taking on TSLA ends up tanking the market?
what are the odds tesla ACTUALLY splits again?
Any plans for the gme anniversary?
tsla 1500 is not a meme

456 is not very far away... Can get there really quickly.
Tesla is the most ridiculous stock ever. How it can just keep going up and up and up thousands of percent with hardly any pull backs I'll never understand.
#RDBX is going to buy me a house!

Of course TIGR goes up to +20% and then drops back to +5%. Completely typical

I just want to say, as a novice investor, the best piece of advice I got from here was from u/vitocorlene. I ignore the market overreaction from 9:30 to 10.
Yeah. I'm up 300%. Bout time for me to sell...

Who the fuck still uses Redbox?!
🚀💦
imma keep it real these dwac bags are heavy and idk what to do next
You plan on holding after ER or selling today/tm morning?
Ex gf?
you're wasting away 1/3 if your life sleeping 8 hours a day, keep the 4 hour schedule
Up 65% on QS 1/21 $30 calls since yesterday. Anyone holding past earnings?
I love Tesla
Forever upvoting this meme.
it didnt, only the share buyback saved them
AMD and INTC are pretty much equally-valued at this point. No more incumbent and underdog
$150 Jan AAPL calls. I'm up over 30% now. Should i hold these through earnings or sell before you think? Would IV crush affect these?
Tesla puts we’re a bad idea
Anyone else holding AMD calls thru earnings?
Just a friendly tip, if you’re up a stupid amount on TSLA and you have multiple contracts, you can always sell a few to cover your initial investment. That way if the unthinkable happens you’re still up. TSLA can be a cruel mistress.
Note to self: Every time I play AMD ER, I lose big.
NVDA is most valuable semiconductor company for a reason. Investors don’t have a sell button
pretty mixed. they beat on EPS, guidnace, and new users, but lost on revenue. Itll prolly go up and down all day today as bers and bulls fight over whether those were good or bad numbers.
121 calls in the stratosphere
Is RDBX a good buy right now?
Wtf how

Never forget flat as an option, brother. Strangles scare me. I’m all in on bad tech news and tax news tomorrow.

**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/Codicus1212** bet **AMD** goes from **123.1** to **140.0** before **2021-10-29 09:39:35.852494-04:00**
Reversal?
Same
That iv crush for you. Based on iv you can calculate what expected move is priced in, on some stocks its ridiculous and not point of buying options right before earnings.

Hi all its Miachel Burry, I hereby resign my position as bear master general effective immediately.

Just remember that boomers are happy with 2% yield per year ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Until then, bears fuk
I have 6 positions.  Every one I need to go down is up, and every one I need to go up is down.  This is very common for me. At some point I'm going to admit defeat and just start buying SPY shares.  2021 has been a very bad year for me, trading-wise.  If I had 0% gains on the year I'd have far more money than I do now.
!Banbet AMD $140 3D
Clearly I’m gonna buy the AMD top and hold thru earnings
I was a highwayman
The blow-off top before the misery. Looks so obvious. I'll buy the puts. RIP
OCGN Calls are printing rn
Nvidia is a tank
Dying.  It's over
I sold AMD, NVDA, MSFT and AAPL on Friday. They were supposed to tank after earnings. But with rise like that even if they do I'll have to buy them out higher.

Sell low buy high
I got my 123 and 125c calls printing 😎
I think the market changed its mind overnight and now hates FB &gt;:(

What should I buy ? Hurry ?
I got and 126c
It's reggaeton and ya it sucks
Well it’s confirmed now, buying a GoldenDoodle and naming it NVDA

So unbelievably horny from these charts. Gotta paint my room white now.

I don't think he's made a move yet. I was actually talking about that with my wife. When it quadruple topped in a 2 week span, I couldn't tell what was going to happen after the first two didn't matter. The channel is so fricken wide it makes TA tough, then does what you least expect.
Up 1.8% in pm
Don't day trade AAPL.  It's a buy and look at it when you retire.  By then they will have released the iTeleporter and the iReplicator and the iFusion.  Either that or they will still be working on the iPhone 18 and be down to $0.22.  Either way.

is TIGR worth it?

Who’s investing in redbox?
I couldn't tell you at this point.

It could've have been overreactions in both directions the whole time. Maybe it was something Zucc said at earnings call. Maybe the reality of missed revenues set in. Could be SNAP having a minor effect on outlook. A lot of stuff.

most likely it will go up, that said it's incredibly risky. Average price target is a 20% loss. If you really want to buy shares wait for it to fall back to the trendline.

bad take, very myopic viewpoint from you.

harming your consumers is absolutely not good business. and if you think just because addiction causing repeat customers is "good business" then idk what to tell you really but that's pretty fucked

i personally don't even dislike the service, if one is aware of the algorithms then it's easy to not let the suggestions and feed get out of hand and it's easy to keep in mind that what you see is tailored to you and not necessarily the whole story. but not everybody knows about this because facebook and other companies don't want to educate their users on this as it will result in less eyes-on-screen time.

what you are doing is removing responsibility of a company to act in an ethical way. when facebook literally causes addiction in its users it is no longer an issue of "free will." it is a public health issue.

I see where you are coming from though, i do agree that the user bears some of the responsibility, but facebook absolutely does as well. Jan. 6 rioters definitely deserve to be punished, but facebook at least owes some explanation and forward planning

The P/E is incredulous, and yes, supply chain might eventually get resolved, but all other players in the market have been making EVs for years.

They chose not to and now they’re going to have no excuse for having zero profits come earnings call next week.

Yes

I'm wondering if OSTK is a good play on Bitty.  I know they have been involved and accepting it for a while, plus they have the whole other business.
Don't take those personally.  We love bear traders, but hate bear markets.  It's a "love the sinner hate the sin" type of situation.

Who gives a fuck about morals or health outcomes?  MO is a business that gets regulated on the regular.  It is a favorite when a politician wants to levy a regressive tax or impose a hefty fine; or a virtue-signalling billionaire wants to throw a few billion at destroying a public company; or a political group wants to weaken the places the industry operates by depriving them of the black slave labor on which the industry was built. The forces arrayed against MO are economically potent and vast.  The only one thing they have working in their favor is that nicotine is addictive; it's a business model that's already been squeezed for all its tarry brown juice and is now a lifeless contracting husk.
Watch Tesla gap up another 80 today. Shit quit making sense awhile back
They aren't going to play the NTSB's game. People following the company already knew that long ago

That's not true - in the near term, the acquirer's stock price dips considerably due to a lot of unknowns with the acquisition.
Why is FB dipping like a hoe?
Their earnings are in a couple days no? Number will change I'm sure

I'm really disgusted by what unfolded yesterday
Ok, hear me out. What if Elon paid hertz to buy 100,000 Teslas? He said he is autistic and it is certianly something i would do to fuk the shorts. Even the company he "paid" to do it fits the autistic itch, hertz. Come on, ne1 actually on the spectrum knows if they were a billionare, wanted to fuk shorts, and loves the memes would do this.
And this is without the 4680, and the advances from the Austin and Berlin factory. It’s without Tesla insurance.
yea pretty much, or less than half
Nice, I was just joking. I bought some CLF LEAPS way back when people were whining about inflation at first and CLF proceeded to shit the bed, so I ate a loss.

does any1 actually think TSLA is worth 1 T? u gotta be out ur damn mind to think this is a real stock and not just a tool for the US to apply it's monetary policy
Brad, we meet again
Should tell everyone they need to know that this is a meme stock clown company. 

I fully expect to drop at earnings now.
What's up with PLTR. The rocket is ready, I'm counting and counting but the countdown won't end.
It's new support base is around $24.6 from $22 two months ago. It's coming.
Still holding GME probably
Headshot. Nice.
Only down 70% total now then?
Probably not, because profit margin‘s are incredibly high and there are a ton of different revenue generators.

Quantumscape is cool but even if they get it to work, I wonder if they will be able to produce at scale at a attractive price point. I view that company more as a vector for electric aviation.

And when that finally happens will their market cap correct in half for their expected future earnings?

There are plenty of Teslas, look at quantumscape, 10 to 120 and then back to 20. once TSLA hits 1200 maybe it can correct to 200.
Yup another missed retirement play

Clown world take, that acquisition would’ve gotten them to the UK gambling market which is more open than the US currently
Think tesla will hit 2000 today when elon tweets "price is too high, funding secured."?

I wouldn’t, buy some shares and use the rest on other calls
This dude is giving me so much pleasure with his mouth right now
Dam this FB fade.
You just blow in from stupid town? Buying calls that are already up 100% or more?
how do you see this?
Nice. Those must’ve been absolutely printing the past few days
I guess but the whole play in sports gambling is to get into as many markets as possible to become profitable. This would’ve put them into UK sports betting which is more open than the US currently.

I guess draftkings figured it’s good for business stay non profit, they don’t want to grow.
I got calls
Prog is about to blow
jacked right now
This Friday
DKNG
Can you ban bet yourself too brother
possibly, but the market clearly didn't see the potential entain acquisition that way. that's why dkng dropped from $60s to $40s. it would have been a very complicated deal because of MGM, plus DKNG would be trying to acquire a company nearly as valuable as the entire market cap of DKNG itself. too much to swallow.
You might struggle a little with that goal, but I believe in you!
PROG
Cloudflare has $600M revenue. It’s trading at 100x sales. At that same multiple TSLA would be worth $3T and they are growing much faster.
Is skilz gonna be new $NET?

OCUGEN gonna halt upwards today tendiesss
I should clarify. I mean TSLA credit spreads
Model S i booked yesterday
like the scooters?
For the rest of the year
What happens if TSLA stock splits?
Over 90% of the major websites route through them. And they're getting competitive in the cloud business with aggressively priced blob storage and edge computing.

Na, bears might win. Down 2$ premarket at present
Volatility in $TIGR is awesome. Big upside IMO
Weed is insanely overvalued so other than the random retail frenzy here and there the natural state is going down

And about 10,000 are born every day so it equals out.  However, at the moment there are too many humans on the planet so if the birth rate could drop -  here and around the world we could bring the human population down to a more manageable level (in terms of resources, etc. )  =====   In the United States, about 10,267 babies were born each day.

Todays the day for OCGN! Again!
Scalped it yesterday for 20%
AMD shares
Yes, $ME is in the early innings. It’s not just a company about genetic lineage testing. Check out the collaboration with GSK. That made me bullish
Classic "ber r fuk" pattern forming on the $TSLA chart
I know the stock isn’t the company and the company isn’t the stock but as a person who has never used Redbox I’m always amazed why anyone would. I’d rather have one streaming service than drive my car to a Walgreens to get a movie….but I always see dudes there getting dvds.

Take a step back and listen to what you just said. You are basically calling for the disbarment of a person from society….You are telling a person that they cannot work or travel. That is a kin to killing a person, you’re playing with fire.

Plenty of other plays and most of us miss it everyday by a slim margin
Telecom also
Same people in my town who never disclose how they were doing financially on stocks and jumped on anyone who asked (which in fairness Is rude I guess) now won't shut up about specifics made from Tsla calls.

Obviously I have jealousy but don't go from not willing to share anything to over sharing to people who didn't even ask
Well? What are you seeing?

Boohoo someone got addicted to puts.gif
Was stoned at dinner after a long day, couldn’t trade. saw DD on Redbox, bought 350s at $15, just sold 300 at $22.5. 

That helped
Every 401k, pension, dollar cost average investor and anyone who thinks the bear weekend has ended and we are returning to then long term tend line.
Start praying man, there’s many people probably with the 10/29 $1,000 contracts. This stock needs to continue going brrrrr throughout this week!
*"Wild $T1mes!"* means he's excited about entering the $1T club (and is obviously not planning to leave it anytime soon) and more importantly he is signaling that he's quietly watching the stock, obviously looking for when to pull the trigger and announce a stock split. He knows in particular all Tesla employees are waiting just for that. That's more bullish than even my (and VisualMod's) previous ASCII bunny DD.
Ugh. Can’t believe I sold my NVDA calls yesterday… should I get back in

Go for it, don't forget to post your loss afterwards.
What’s more painful… the morning after a spicy food dinner or watching your options expire?
Damn NVDA deep dicking
This is such a tired argument, hospitals aren’t overrun. Our medical system is not overwhelmed. And this has become endemic. It’s ridiculous that you still are saying shit like this. That rhetoric is dangerous for humanity. You need to stop
Weed may not be hated but it has been pushed down for like a year now
Nope.  Companies will want them just as soon as they have them.
Why?
yooo what am i seeing with this DKNG candle!?!?

Yea well i don't think its a good idea for unvaccinated folks to fill up hospital beds that need to be open for people sick with other needs.  This conversation really fucking tiring.  You don't want to get vaccinated then dont, but if godforbid you get covid-19 and get really sick don't take up other peoples resources for it.
I'm holding puts, so I'm a lil biased. But who TF is buying spy at this price? I mean seriously....Jesus titty effing christ
Congrats. Profit's profit.
No, just a lot of inactive accounts and it can be multiple accounts of the same people
lol this guy fast forwarded to friday
What sectors are the most hated right now?
Damn guys I'll start letting you know when I sell a covered call against any of my stock. That's the signal it's about to moon.
take an economics course lol
Much better to have people who’s only accomplishment is the child they shit out decide these things.

Yeah that’s what I’m looking for. Even though I’m not hung over in the morning I feel like I’m still lagging a little

Maybe I've been accidentally good about it.
apparently there's like $5B in TSLA calls expiring this week (way more than puts), totally normal   😒
CMG should be at a 1T market cap.
Which is why it’s a dividend stonk. Great yield. I own none because it’s so boring and I don’t like their products. Respect to the king though.
Everyone was warned not to bet against TSLA.

They deserve to be sad not heeding the warning.
Anyone else having LCID dreams lately?
I'd say sell by the end of today, or middle of the day. If you're up then you're up.

Now DKNG can finally wake back the fuck up
tell that to the ever increasing dividend

Hehe.
Nice. FUBO's been heading up on the run up to earnings too, I think this is the first quarter we get sportsbook earnings, or at least clear sportsbook guidance.
so buy calls?
Yeah you're not wrong. I used to buy 5 at a time then I'd find myself averaging down and barely break even so now it's one or two and take a comfortable profit
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down more than 1,100 points since its peak on Jan. 26, and has fallen 10% from the all-time high it set last month.
DKNG back to the 60s... has removed itself from the bid for Entain
He doesn't play the stock market lol

Bought $CMG, now I will just order a lot of chipotle from door dash snd watch my money grow 🧠

Let him enjoy this moment, he probably made a ton off TSLA yesterday.
LM will continue to die. I believe they are implementing a vaccine mandate and anyone who doesn’t take it (union workers included), will no longer be able to work there after end of November. Hearing TONS of the workers are refusing, especially here in Texas.
TSLA puts gonna go brrrrrrr 🥶
Time to ride the snap train
&gt; MO is a shitty company with no growth prospects.
GOd bless my UPS $230 calls about to print! Same with TGT, WMT,SPY, and QQQ. LET the money printer COMMENCE!
is TSLA's success proof that the best outcomes result from government and corporations working together rather than corporations having free rein or government imposing too many regulations and restrictions

i think economic theory has held for a long time that government subsidies provide the most benefit to an economy and its participants but this is a pretty clear irl example
or we can just realize profits until then ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
can we get some love for the undervalued dividend king MO?
After that run yesterday it is a reasonable play
Answer? Everyone!
Not much, what's $UPS with you?
Don’t fade fuckbook cmon
That’s because he has TSLA puts
Finally DKNG with the bonus round 🥊
I guess it was undervalued? Simply means the original price was too low, doesn't mean it's a great stock. I haven't done research so I'm just totally guessing

What was the news?
So.. think I learned a lesson here. Bought VIX calls yesterday atm for Nov 10th, makes sense that the extrinsic value is the primary component of option price. My brain said since volatility is low (by the VIX value) the option should be cheaper. But when I look up options the IV is ~150%. So if VIX goes up, am I going to be IV crushed?

Spy gonna rip higher. Don’t normally buys calls when it’s already on a ripper but those September lows gave it room to growwwwwww
yes. same sector. if one run ussualy all microchips sector follow.
&gt; I'm not sure.
This some infinite money hack shit
Apparently a spac merger that finished and started trading yesterday no ideal why it doubled last night maybe the news was slightly delayed.  Congrats i dunno if I’d hold that one for long but maybe they wanna switch to a streaming hybrid.

Right, We’re gonna kill earnings
If AMD tanks NVDA rips? If AMD rips NVDA rips?
Tesla, noooo
Smell containment. Too bad there's holes.
AMD is running before earnings, NVDA is still trying to sort out arm, TSM keeps sand trapping. So leaps

I hope a big beat!!
Of course I’m holding!
Imagine buying calls after the last 9/10 days has been very green. I mean, it will probably work, but imagine clicking buy anyways.

WHO news done leaked it getting approved and they will announce any moment.FIRST TRADITIONAL VACCINE. COVID IS GONNA BE LIKE THE FLU. Ok so this is what I keep saying when I said a billion times now. OCGN HAS BEEN IN TALKS WITH THE FDA FOR MONTHS NOW. 3 of there vaccine scientists on board have worked with Pfizer before and one of them FOR THE FDA. That being said WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WHEN W.H.O EUL APPROVAL COMES TUESDAY, THE FDA WON’T APPROVE??

W.H.O is FDA’s grandaddy. On top of everything OCGN submitted master file about 4 months ago to the FDA which everyone keeps forgetting about.

ITS GONNA GET BOTH W.H.O &amp; FDA APPROVED, 100000000% SURE, very fast time frame within each other.

OCGN &amp; FDA been on good terms with eachother FDA always approving there gene therapies trials for the cure to blindness.

I might actually be able to get in today... NVDA 232.50p and pray it's a normal day where it touches the pivot/fills the gap before mooning. In that case I'm hoping for a 250% return. LFG
It's not an earnings play, they got WHO approval today pending, announcement tmrow that might push it stock high up

It's gone up almost every day for the last month and everyone thinks it will crush earnings. Expectations are very high, so if it misses, it could correct. But given this market right now, everyone is FOMOing into everything that can be bought, so probably will continue to run.

I bet you I do. I got my 459 calls at 9$ they are now worth over 25$ a pop. Also if we stay above 455.55 before close today we will be hitting 469 by next week. So today spy could possibly open green then dump for the gap up to 463 then 469 by next week.

Pretty much all your gains are somebody else's losses though, no?
today, tomorrow and the rest of the week
Dropping for no reason? More like dropping just as expected. It was a pump and dump. That’s how people here looked at it. If you wanna stay in for the long haul then who gives a shit.

Don’t we have a horse jizz specialist in this sub. I’d like some expert commentary before trying.
HOW??? WTF IS PROG???
You know what this thread needs? More people posting 4 numbers, surrounded by  colins, without writing a single word. It's so useful and well thought out. Don't know how I'd trade without them.
Here is the play for you all trash. If by chance tesla says they accept digcoin, fucking coin will explode to the moon
Msft 350 EoD🚀🚀🚀🚀
Bulls are cephalopods not equines
Maybe get a brokerage for adults?

Or move to a less retarded country without day trading laws.
I felt like a genius when I sold my Tesla and doubled my money a day before it dumped a couple years ago.

AMD option premiums are wild.. if it gets at least a 3% pop NVDA is fuckin blasting this week
Calls on TSLA halting by 10 AM
How we looking zuckers
Stop it TSLA stop it!
Little tip for you traders, when a stock doesn’t move up while the rest of the market gaps up, it’s most likely going to tank/have a very bad day
i got my first pattern day trade bullshit restriction on robinhood.
Sold PROG yesterday lol
True I think buying calls a month out or maybe 2 weeks out and diamond handing until expiration every single time ensures you hit more often than not. I think most if not all of the times I’ve completely blown up my account if I woulda held a day or a week later My calls would have hit every time and my account would not be blown to fucking bits. Granted like you said your not buying the literal top into a steady decline.

Right after fake money.
Buy Snap so i can dump please
I missed almost all meme plays 🤡
Always happens after I ditch 😆
Do your own research cunt boi
Diamond hands work if you bought the bottom, if you bought the top like these clov and wish tards, diamond handing just leads to being BTFO.
Even if that were true, I would never be jealous of Bill Gates. Id rather spend my days at the Wendys dumpster than be anything like that focking weirdo
You thinking its going to pull a dwac?  how long till it does?
Lol....bagholders from January of this year.....

Majority of people have been in cash gang since May ( when tapering was announced and shit) these mega tech companies are still smashing earnings by 30%-40%
What you looking for in the report? Or just trying to play ER
$PROG is margin calling. Not lending anymore shares. Buy and hold this thing is for real.

As someone who's been cash gang for close to a year and did not buy TSLA when I was going to, I'm pissed.
[deleted]
CLF going to $30
This is what we pltr bulls settle for as bigly now
So I’ve realized finally (after 2 years of options) that diamond handing is almost 100% of the time how you always win (or win more) like honestly. Paper handing is the recipe to losing almost all the time. The next day or the next week your calls almost always hit after you sell.
PROG looks hot today !
My favorite cowboy is John Wayne
Tapering is not coming, you know it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Its running higher pre market ;)
O wow  TSLA boy what are you doing, wrong way
Hey, poop buddy.
Damn should have brought more TSLA 😖
It’s a joke because when I buy any stock it drops

Retard
Brokers are not allowing anymore shares to be borrowed and closing out positions
ATH breakouts are a dece sign for continued bullishness

/u/majin_river (1/0) made a bet that PROG would go to 4.0 when it was 2.73 and it did, congrats retard.

Bb actually making me money.    Wow
What the PROG??

So glad i used all my margin on this yeserrday.
Money printer
Wtf is PROG
Condolences.
As they become more affordable, it takes much less money to move the spread if you’re short. Having a really high price means that it takes a lot of upfront capital to move the price down, and while you’re doing that borrowing and selling, you’re making it cheaper for other people to buy in. A High stock price (again, I’m an idiot) acts as a bit of a moat so that only people who are pot committed or Serious players can be involved. That’s the reasoning I think I remember for Buffet never splitting Berkshire A, anyway.
I would love to know whos algo is just picking one stock to run up 100% every day.  Guess its prog’s turn today.
Prog is squeezing.....hard

Paul Harrell has shown off his quick draw in videos before but in his Halloween video he did it with pointing the gun towards the camera instead of doing it in side profile and I really thought I was gonna die. Pretty sure he's still not even doing it as fast as he could. Intimidating as fuck, good chance he could cold draw and kill someone who's already pointing a gun at him.
AMD and NVIDIA 🤤
Sold PROG on Friday because I hate money.
Lol GE wtf trying to fool investors

Hey guys. Cash gang here. 

Looking for some suggestions on recent sectors of the market that have potential upside. I kinda want mid to aggressive growth, and will buy shares mostly. I won't buy today, but just looking at potential options when there is a dip.

It seems like no one is noticing GENI. They literally OWN the NFL data... every week they are announcing deals with major companies. They have huge expansion potential in the online marketing space and even taking control over token data for all of the up and coming pivots from DKNG, PENN, etc. And they are only at 4Billion market cap. For a tech company this is insanely cheap and the fundamentals to even justify it unlike other tech companies....
Jesus Christ that face 😂

TSLA gonna do a 4:1 split before EOY, you heard it first from me
[deleted]
Cos I did ?
This is just speculation because I’m an idiot and don’t know anything, but I imagine it’s much easier for short sellers who target the price to manipulate the bid/ask spread on such a large company when individual shares don’t cost as much money. Again, I’m a moron, and could be completely wrong. I never really know why a company does or doesn’t split.

No fuck the lying scheming China bears and racists. So happy to see the US lose to China  economically tbh because all the mother fuckers that kept poking the dragon and instigating shit are the same types as you. Would love to see america grow up and cooperate with China because that‚Äôs the only way we are getting off this planet but I‚Äôm not holding my breathe. Won‚Äôt happen until the ignorant mErIcA nUmbEr oNe nationalist and boomer generation die off. Don‚Äôt worry, your grandkids will hopefully be less ignorant and will live in a world where racism doesn‚Äôt exist. Keep holding on to that hate, Youll die faster and be out of your misery quicker
Better boof em

Hey man I got big money in BABA too, I‚Äôm just being realistic. The sentiment won‚Äôt change over night. I suspect we‚Äôll be rangebound for a few more months. We might have a small pop but I would bet anything that we won‚Äôt just have a quick reversal back to $300 within a few months.

Yawn. Come back with something factual. Bigggg yawnnnnn
Why suck? You didn't close puts?
The email my manager sent seemed like she was telling us to go into the office next week instead of asking.

Might have a fuckin problem folks.
Do it! Xi needs more money for his common prosperity
Lmao. Get rekt
Good luck on yours endeavors. BABA GANG
It‚Äôs hilarious that bears are betting against the worlds greatest company of all time and the worlds greatest investors of all time simultaneously. It literally could not be more clear that China bears are fucking finished. Squeeze time
About as disappointing as BABA stock price.

Say hello to massive inflation spikes!
Lol. It's not racist to say chinese trash in terms if the stock market. There is greater inherent risk dealing with chinese stocks due to the nature of their government and the structure of the companies.

Please don't throw around the racist word in contexts it doesn't belong. It shows the stupidity of the times.

I love the pic of a bear who just lost his mortgaged house and implicitly also his wife and kids trying not to cry on the CNBC homepage
Let me ask your wife she would know
Last I checked BABA was in the toilet, so they were right?
Charlie Munger increased his BABA stake by 82%. Truth.
Offshore is in technical default right now through the 23rd of October.

&amp;#x200B;

As of 10/23 or 10/24, that's when offshore bonds can begin the process of taking possession of physical property.

&amp;#x200B;

Notice how their stake in the banking business was forced to sell?  CCP doesn't want foreigners with any control in their financial system.

&amp;#x200B;

Offshore bond holders are fukt as bad as bears are today.  They'll get assigned unfinished projects as "assets".
Yah now I got the herpes.. Why didn't you say something before smfh

Is it time to let DIDI back into the App Store? Would love to dump my bags.
BABA is gonna create a whole new generation of bag holders on this next dead cat bounce huh?

Called it!!!;;
Yea I remember when bears said that about baba the last two times they short attacked it. YAWNNNNNN FIND NEW FUD OH WAIT THERE IS NONE
There's people that bought at 139
When Xi has his way with you does he use lube?
America pretty much invented the upside. China is just bootlegging it.
So im not the only one

Too green for my taste
At least if Xi makes BABA a nonprofit it would save a bunch in taxes
So you‚Äôre just racist then? Ok got it
He'll suck 'em dry and leave you on read when you come crawling back for more
The idiotic thing people don‚Äôt realize is most of the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù gas prices we see today is because of the ridiculous gas taxes that politicians imposed over the past 10 years. If per barrel inflation adjusted we went back to the ‚Äò08 high, gas would be like $9 a gallon. Back then it was closer to $5
Maybe after you learn to appreciate NYC girls and realize their attitude is more for comedic effect than actual meanness.
Evergrande said they aren‚Äôt paying foreign investors
Guys we don‚Äôt have to do this anymore. The rules state that we can take a vote to forget the tendies and get out before we get hurt.
Plus if they are indexed based ETFs they are often utilizing futures contracts.  Those are usually in contango where the back month is priced higher than the front month.   The fund is continually rolling these contracts by selling the cheaper contract and buying a more expensive contract.   It creates a decay over time.
No. America is overvalued and has small upside compared to China. Literally all the historically smart investors are in China like dalio and munger, along with the banks. China is legit some deeeeeeep fucking value and there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd trade it for American shit

Lol! Claims he sold the top and now tries to get everyone to buy back in. You are a fucking looser. Worse than the people in here who pump and dump SPACs
That would be fun for me!
Wow looks like someone really doesn‚Äôt want baba to go up. Why is that? I‚Äôd love to hear why
XI can suck my BALLS
you've got to be careful who you get into bed with.
Listen here fart stain I thought I would have already ate them by now
Don‚Äôt really care about evergrande it‚Äôs the biggest nothing burger of the year tbh. Everyone knew about this for ten years
They havent released earnings yet have they
Im not worried about Chinese shit. The CCP will let companies like evergrande collapse but theyll do everything to keep the country from going boom 

Good luck controlling 1.5billion people when they riot and loot
Imagine investing in a Chinese ADR.

It‚Äôs not even the actual company, it‚Äôs Cayman Island shell that the real company pinky-swear promises to share profits with.
Investors never learn. Baba does nothing but go down, unlike my wife
Wow truly retarded.  Your brain can't figure out that it can still be moved into freezer?
Yeah, fucking is definitely cooler than shitting.
If you're going back to Chinese stocks just remember that Evergrande didn't fully pay their bond coupon and they have one month to do so or it's default, so be careful around 20 October (right with opex week like a clockwork)
Yup should recover nicely for a strong push into end of year, all we need is a colder than usually winter. Heating oil will take over vs expensive af Nat Gas
You‚Äôre acting like I didn‚Äôt sell some when the FUD started lmfao. Like I said the more you comment the more you‚Äôre proving me right.

They will now use the public square and people are free to stop by and fap

If tortillas are rarely opened but in the fridge the entire time how but in the fridge the entire time how long do they last
Is it though? I feel this is more of a temporary halt because the leadership is afraid Mainland/HK stocks have fallen to far. China is so over levered it's crazy, they just make illegal instruments and go, I recommend you read China the Bubble that Never pops even if you don't read the whole book, it's just amazing how brazen these people are in off the books speculation, it's similar I guess to 1920's America before the SEC. I'd imagine Chinese stock declines are starting break shadow investment vehicles.

Xi is just doing his job. He doesn't make the rules
i mean i thought it was low at 170 but here we are at 150s

bounced off the 140s, guess at that point it was just too low in terms of risk/reward
Nothing in China has changed
Ok tankie
I prefer watching it burn in 10 mins instead of being a professional bagholder for months (yes, that's me)
i never sold my chinese stocks, i rode those fuckers to rock bottom:BILI, BEKE, TME...etc no way i was booking the loss.
Can‚Äôt tell if this is Gabe Plotkin or Ray Dalio. I know both of you are anal only for Xi
wHaT?
Strong buy
Time to buy in then you reckon, or gonna keep drilling anyway?
Of course it matters because the people who did it are long dead, holding their descendants accountable is absurd and unjust. The ones doing it in China right now are alive. You can blame them because they are guilty.

As far as the Nazi comparison? If you think having opinions makes someone as bad as a murderer, you‚Äôre truly lost.
China has agreed not to torture people in camps anymore
Yea it‚Äôs egregiously undervalued and the victim of an act of financial terrorism from Wall Street scum, and people are waking up and realizing the bear cases are fake and the same ones they use every time they do this bullshit. Everyone in the financial world knows China is going to have the next great bull run, they obviously want to shake out people to get in cheap and they got away with it. Banks and smart money are jacked to the tits on China
Xi Jinping has a gay lover
I don't know why but I really want SPY to fade into open and then dump. Oh yea, I do know why. So my puts print (cries in 1DTE)
Let‚Äôs hope the 10yr saves me sometime this week
The stocks are piles of shit China uses fo sell when it needs more money to torture people in camps

Based. I also bailed on China and made money. But I still lost my account later lol
Baba at 200 was a smart buy, still is.
I have so many damn puts in everything I can‚Äôt buy any more
just let them get called away
Fear has to exceed greed. As we approach interest rates increasing, this will eventually happen.
Xi never fucked us it was Wall Street and the media. Xi did nothing but what was best and what was right, I‚Äôd love to see America take some notes. They got the right idea with Facebook so far
Except they are Chinese stocks. China isn‚Äôt investable
the decay doesnt work like theta, and is only more pronounced when its choppy like qqq. triple leveraged s&amp;p is better than qqq in that sense
Does wsb take place in the 80s?
Forget today. N buy affrm put
Ouch, yeah I usually ride my calls closer to the cliff, if not over the cliff. I know you want to get something back before it‚Äôs worthless but at least hold a few. But I‚Äôm always optimistic they will come back.
No morning dip today, gonna rip to 443 then end around 431
Your history is off then. And just because something happened ‚Äúin the past‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it gets to slide. You‚Äôre a typical American nationalist,  no better than a nazi. May god have mercy on your soul dude I‚Äôm done with you, you can‚Äôt see the light I guess

These aapl calls that expire in a couple weeks should be up nicely tomorrow

https://imgur.com/a/izUmyWn
Fuck I hope you‚Äôre right but, it looks like today is gonna suck
Imagine taking a 10% loss on a 100$ stock. But its doubled. So you take a 20% loss. Now when the stock recovers that 10%, you make back 20% of the current cost of the stock, which is now 80$. 20% of 80 is 16.4. So now you have $96.4 where as the original stock has made all of its money back. It adds up pretty quick if you have a lot of up and down movement.
Sorry I misunderstood, you‚Äôre taking about leveraged ETFs!

awesome i love chyna. will hold till 11.11 sales and chyna megacaps report their earnings and ppl see how undervalued they are
Yeah I just figured we were in a correction so the am poop would inevitably lead to a drop.  I've now come to the realization that we injected too much money in to the economy to have a true 10-20% correction.  Any good  news, like yesterday's, is going to cause buying to happen.

I tolerate China only because they still produce Nintendo hardware that Nintendo does not produce. You can order a new Gameboy Color right now off the assembly line with Mario Tennis built in. If not for that, the country should have been glassed.

Imagine a Kangaroo being shot mid hop, that was me yesterday. On Tuesday bought a put right before SPY fell off a cliff and made money.  After that dive I bought a call right at close.

Do they? we assume so, but we never ask. They're all here. Feels rude not to ask.

I never listen to any one besides myself.the market the entire week has been doing a neutral pattern. I'm going to guess its going down today. Good news is coating the extremely bad news like a tiny blanket and I'm not certain we can break trend right now in the dow. The dow is being pumped due to the fact that China is buying coal from aulstalia and India Is doing the same thing. Other coal facilities are experiencing some extreme events right now and did not prepare for global demand  for some weird reason. Could someone explain why energy companies did not prepare for global energy demand.

I think the final 5 seconds of the Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet theme is the most perfect 5 seconds of music it's possible for humans to create in the art of recorded music. This doesn't mean the art form is over, there's plenty of room to explore in the realm of stuff longer than 5 seconds and by only being 5 seconds long it's pretty much useless musically. But we've only had recorded music for a tiny portion of the thousands and thousands of years music has existed, so it's interesting to me that we've already come up with 5 seconds worth of perfect waveforms, and it's especially interesting to me that it's in the opening theme of some obscure anime. I highly recommend looking up said anime's theme song and just skipping to the last 5 seconds of it.

Edit - it's actually more like the last 6 or 7 seconds, which I guess kinda matters for clarity's sake my bad

I seriously hope that Weiss and soros trying to convince retail that baba was ‚Äúworth nothing‚Äù so that they would sell cheap will finally be the event that makes them lose ALL credibility. I can‚Äôt even begin to understand how people even still lend an ear to these criminals. This is not the first time they‚Äôve tried to pull this shit.

Brokers like td ameritrade account for your wash sale into cost basis. So if you like sell stock for a loss of 2 dollar and later buy back at 10 dollars, your cost basis is going to be 12 dollars. That extra 2 dollar is the loss you could have claimed if you waited 30 days after you sold your stock for a loss.  Just don‚Äôt worry about it too much. It‚Äôs not a big deal.

Look I'm sorry but an America where I have to know advanced quantum physics and trigonometry and shit to decipher sentences like this before I'm allowed to trade stocks is just not an America I'm cut out for. I can only hope the powers that be will have mercy on me or I'll just get lucky enough to coincidentally not do whatever would count as breaking the rule because I can barely understand what Bollinger values are, let alone what in heck's fucking name "buy back the same stock within 30 days" means.

You lost me at "you can't sell a stock." Everything you're saying is just going completely over my head at that point, I don't even understand what Constitutional basis your sentence is starting from. Each paragraph of your comment is more incoherent to me than the last and I will not be able to remember a single word of it by the time the market opens. I tried my best. If push comes to shove, I'm just gonna say "I'm sorry your honor, I still don't know why I'm here and there's no way I'm gonna understand anything anyone's talking about here, so just do what you must."
I think all is saying is if you sell stock for a loss, and if you buy back the same stock within 30 days, you can‚Äôt count the loss into your cost basis. 

For example, If you can sell A for a loss and buy back A immediately and later sell A for gains then essentially you could just avoid paying taxes. IRS wants your money so you can‚Äôt do that.
Futures are up big which means sell off will start aroung 9:35am and market will close 1% down.

What's so hard to understand?

You can't sell a stock, and then buy it back within 30 days without it being considered a wash sale. 

People try to use wash sales to realize losses for tax purposes and then go and buy back what they sold after a few days, so they don't miss the upside. The irs doesn't buy that shit.

Tbh the easiest way I can debunk this from my own perspective is I'm extremely intelligent so if it's about cities having a high bar for intelligence I still wouldn't have had problems with women in NYC, much less in my home area upstate. Similar to how I could tell it's not the appearance thing because I was ugly enough in NY that it would be silly to think I'm no longer ugly at all where I live now.

But since you probably don't like the idea that I'm extremely intelligent, the stronger proof for you to understand that your theory doesn't add up is that not every situation allows you to show off your intelligence. Not every interaction can be presented with a clever one liner. Are you so smart you'll never once in your life accidentally get in someone's way because you're distracted by your phone? Are you so smart you're going to come up with some mind blowingly clever way to apologize any time you ever accidentally get in someone's way because you're distracted by your phone? Is someone out there so smart his words just make women wet every time he speaks, assuming women get wet every time someone is really smart? Surely you can see how this makes no sense when you give it any critical thinking. Your intelligence cannot explain absolute differences in how an entire sex treat you across all kinds of everyday encounter, regardless of what different standards for intelligence different regions might have.

Butt got cheeks too
Yeah, I let him fuck me over on a bio-pharm play I was making based on FDA approval. Was up over 100% on it and it crashed to a bit above my entry. Saw a bunch of people talking about how he doubled down and it was a great play still and why the rumor of it not getting FDA was bogus so checked out his twitter convinced myself. So rather then sell I was like alright this big spender jumped in for a lot more so I'll wait and see. Yeah, no FDA approval -60%.

My own fault for going against my own instincts, especially since I had the opportunity to take good profits on an already risky play, but taking the time to listen to some twitter guy with a rabid fanbase didn't do me any favors.
I can lbs you on the Burt cheeks
I'm starting to prefer states like that to Washington, Oregon, and California that are full of hypodermic needles and shanty towns

your long lost friend.
Girls will treat you like you‚Äôre ugly if you act nervous or insecure, at the same time if you just act normal and stop worrying about it they will see you as a man even if you are ugly. Girls are vicious man they can sense weakness smell it even

Same bro. I had a friend from Chicago who would tell me I don't understand what real hardness or what really bloody streets is like and where I'm from is soft by comparison. I'm not even from the city, just a nice area upstate with a low crime rate, and I was always like dude, you do not understand that where I grew up made me not care if I get killed so I could literally walk up to anyone in Chicago and say whatever the fuck I want to them, it's not that I don't know how hard they are it's that where I'm from you have to be ready to die to survive. It's wack as fuck

I think you need some sleep if you're taking people seriously in the tomorrow thread at 2 AM is what I think. I also live in the midwest where people are friendly as fuck to your face regardless of how they feel about you or if they've never met you before.

I'm just throwing out a possibility dude, and it's definitely possible that somewhere like NYC or LA, etc standards on looks are much much higher.  Maybe you dress funny, stupid haircut, bad facial hair?
If you really think people in NY are so much more attractive than people everywhere else in America that the reason a guy gets treated worse in NY than elsewhere is because by NY standards of hotness he's disgusting but by other places' standards he's not ugly at all, then holy shit, you watch too much TV or something and really need to get out of your bubble and travel a little bit.

I've had women in NYC straight up ignore me talking to them because they were sketched out and wanted to be left alone, even when I wasn't being sketchy at all but just asking for directions or something, like it was just their policy for any guy approaching them to be ignored for safety's sake. It feels much better living somewhere that bitches don't be that way.

I say NVDA.

Reason is nvda is one of best in A.I and we know A.I is going to be the most dominant one in next decade. Even for today nvda is priced at lowest given their advancement in A.I.

Imagine in next decade, no need of software engineers and most of those things could be automated with A.I stuffs.  The self driving car could travel places and navigate reach at your door step while you dont need to drive. It can park in your garage and come back to you. 

An artificial intelligence application can cook dishes for you and serve you at home. 

NVDA is completely future tech. It should be priced equivalent to Amazon depending on how every industry could depend on NVDA for A.I they could change the world

I didn't realize it until years after moving away but the worst thing about living in upstate NY (and the city would probably be even worse) was the paranoia of females. Imagine feeling like when it gets dark out you're no longer allowed to speak to any woman who's alone in case she feels like you're trying to rape her. I mean in NY I could have been bleeding to death waiting for help on a sidewalk and if the first person to come along was a woman I would have had to seriously consider the weight of my fear of making her uncomfortable by looking like a crazy guy approaching her vs my fear of the blood spilling out of me. No exaggeration. Feels crazy to live in a place where opposite sexes actually treat each other like humans and look back on what it was like to feel like that.

There is nothing wrong with an anus we all have them. Please stop body shaming
They are gas and they have surfaces it's called getting cucked by gravity.
Yeah no offense but the drive thru girl does not care about your recommendations. She is never going to listen to them, she's going to go home and bounce on her boy chads dick. And ur gonna go home and beat off to squids or something you permavirgin
McD and heyyy wait a sec why are you asking me how old I am?

For context she was telling me how the customer in front of me in line tried to get her to give him $30 of food for free with a girl in his passenger seat looking like she was overdosing. She gave me some free food but not them. She had time for the moment of chatting waiting for my food to be finished up or whatever and it just felt like the right moment to spread Squid Game's truth

When I was a kid I discovered someone's point stash in the dumpster. Somebody threw out hundreds of items. I went back to collect it an hour later and somebody beat me to it.  You have to strike while the iron is hot
Well... I buy and sell made up imaginary derivative bullshit to other people who then turn around and do the same.   


At the end of it all, I try to end up with more green paper than what I started with in order to then buy material possessions I don't need. Afterwards, I do it all over again.
Hey man, I‚Äôll beat it to gains too, I don‚Äôt discriminate

Germany hasn't opened yet.. And on 6th Oct it only did 2700 shares total volume, so Germany means jack shit.
If The Office was from the current era Dwight would be a wsb user and there would be a storyline about him trying to get Michael Scott to take his referral code for a trading app and Michael being like "no that's stupid individual traders never beat the indexes" or something until eventually Michael caves and signs up but without mentioning it to Dwight or taking his referral code

Bought puts today at close. You‚Äôre welcome!
Often good DD can be distilled to a couple of paragraphs (earnings/investor presentation/bank meeting/announcement/etc., and why the stock will go up/down from that). What I want to ban is people pumping stocks to unload their bags. Often the clover and wish DDs are massive because people know a lot of text will get people here to skim and buy in because few people here read. Most of the stocks people pump to unload are ones that have had massive declines recently.

This is the prey futures doesn‚Äôt lie again hour.
Because I don‚Äôt appreciate the fact we ‚ÄúEnjoy‚Äù other people‚Äôs losses. Have you seen the loss comments here? It‚Äôs very narcissistic. And mean!
Randomly choose any meme ticker from here. After the pump and dump saga. Wait for the ticker to decay and go below the buy level and even about to be delisted. Buy calls apart for like an year out. 

Eventually the ticker raises, these apes will fomo and bail you out with lots of money

Fuk, seeing you shit talking buls is how I switch to looking for put entry

That‚Äôs solid advice. Bears are timid unless provoked. Throw rocks next to it and scream ‚ÄòHey Bear‚Äô they usually always run. Just don‚Äôt actually try and hit them, they would rather run, and even if you hit it with a rock they‚Äôd run most likely. If you actually hit them with something serious they light go into defense mode, in which you want a gun that will be able to take it down Like tonight I was done with scaring it away so shot it with rubber buck shot, not harmful to the bear just a good spanking. If it came back at me then I had a slug ready which would have put it down.
I dont have a pp.

Down more than 50% within six months is far more than beaten up and consolidation. Maybe change to to 75% or 90% then. All I'm trying to do is get rid of the tickers that people are just pumping to unload their bags. No one seriously thinks the new braces company is a good investment; They make a shit product. Same with skillz and wish. They're all garbage, but people pump them to try to offload their bags.

Down more than 50% from six-month high
There ya go bro.
recently took a short vacation to a lesser developed country. 

On my last night I decided to sample some of the more exotic local fare and had a mixed raw seafood dish which was quite good. Lots of tentacles and what not.

 All was fine until the flight home the next day when I started feeling a lot of pressure in my abdomen. I was pretty sure I wasn‚Äôt going to shart, so I leaned over a bit and let out a bit of gas, smooth as silk. I was giving myself a mental high-five when I realized that what was supposed to have been a sly poot turned out to be a cataclysmic stench bomb that instantly engulfed several rows fore and aft.

 Little babies started crying immediately. Adults let out short barks that registered somewhere between shock and despair. In a display of primal instinct, a couple of teens sitting across the aisle reflexively pulled their tee shirt collars up over their mouth and nose.

 The old lady sitting next to me had her head wedged between the seat and the window with her eyes squeezed shut and her mouth in a perfect ‚ÄòO‚Äô, opening and closing, like she was blowing smoke rings. I took a glance over the top of the seats and saw a forest of arms with hands frantically manipulating the air flow nozzles. 

I think a few people were clawing at the drop-down oxygen mask panels, but I don‚Äôt know. A flight attendant up front noticed the commotion and bustled down the aisle, but upon entering the contaminated zone, instantly spun on her heel and beat a hasty retreat. 

I was still feeling bloated and thought with all the tumult I could probably get away with releasing another round. I mean, once you‚Äôve painted a wall no one is going to notice if you add another coat. I looked at the old lady next to me and she was still doing the fish-face thing so I let go with another silent volley of poison gas. If that old lady by the window hadn‚Äôt been wearing long pants she probably would have felt the rush of heat on her leg but she didn‚Äôt budge. 

There was no way I was going to fess up and apologize, so instead I just scowled and pretended to look around for the culprit. Fortunately things cleared out pretty fast. I didn‚Äôt dare try it again, I had taken my fellow passengers by surprise the first time, but now they were wary and fully alert.

 For the rest of the flight, anyone that made their way back to the lavatory was subjected to the scrutiny of a hundred eyes. We landed and I deplaned without further incident, however, I did totally trash a toilet in Customs, but that‚Äôs another story. 

TL;DR Don‚Äôt eat food you are unaccustomed to before getting onto a long flight
Yea not my first, not my last. Just blast those bears in the ass and keep them running

Can we ban discussion of tickers that are down &gt; 50% over the last six months or something? Seems like that would weed out a lot of the shit that gets posted here
A lot of AH stock trading is broker dealer networks. As for futures, they trade 23/6, because of different time zones around the world
Its 10pm so its TLRY time!

I went to a park with my girlfriend. We got woken up by loud bangs one night outside our cabin thing. Next morning a ranger said a bear came into the community and they lit it up with bean bags. I thought neat. Very nice of them. 

Well literally 45 min later I was walking back to my cabin thing and that bear bro was sitting there walking towards me maybe about 50 yards away. 

I am not one to want to run but every fiber in my body said get the fuck out of here. I froze like a bitch. But literally as it‚Äôs walking towards me head down the park rangers swooped in again and pop pop pop. Bear bro ran into the trees. 


Anyways the point of this story is. Bears are fucking scary as shit in real life. Way bigger then I thought. Props to you

Investors have already clearly shown how they feel about rising interest rates. Just look at March and June and then 9/28 interest rate spike and the reaction of growth. Rising rates have always adversely affected growth. Every time we have a good jobs report rates spike, growth names are sold or flat and value sees the inflow. It‚Äôs not rocket science. 10 year is on pace to exceed what we saw in March and June. Powell already said a good jobs report basically means the start of tapering which is on trajectory with rate hikes.

Oh and your gonna be in a dark place for a while. That‚Äôs ok. That expected. Don‚Äôt hand out with negative people nor downers. It‚Äôs better to be alone. If you know positive uplifting people, be around them when you can. But realize that this is a solo journey of self development. Another huge thing is journaling. Get paper and pen (not digital) and write whatever come to mind. Don‚Äôt matter what it is. Write it. It‚Äôs legit therapeutic. Burn that shit if you want after writing. It‚Äôs tremendously helpful. Good luck and don‚Äôt hesitate to message me if you need.

What are your moves tomorrow
Open beta went live yesterday on all platforms. I've played a few hours and I'm into it so far. Huge map to accommodate 128 players, I'm enjoying the large player count, and I like how the big, organic-feeling map reminds me of BF2. The gameplay and the dynamic map changes feel a lot like BF4. Really feels like BF4 on steroids so far to me. I have high hopes for this one after not being a big fan of BFV.

Unless they are at war. History is crystal clear what dictators can and almost always do. And war doesnt have to be fought with kenetic weapons. Tsi is rousing up his nation. Climax will be the Olympics. Going to be interesting to see what happens then.

Edit: Put in Japan in place of China during the oil embargo in 1939. All rational people assumed Japan would negotiate. And they did start negotiations on Dec 7th 1941.

Edit edit: No. We are not any smarter now than in the past. In most ways folks are far more ignorant.
I‚Äôm in the same boat.  It‚Äôs ridiculous.
Tapering means going from pumping $120 billion in free money into the system each month to $105 billion.   It‚Äôs still a fuck load of free money each month for the next year

Get with it dude.  Bears are fucking clueless.  

Are we in a bubble?  Sure.  Is it going to pop soon?  No fucking way.

Lmao. It‚Äôs been that long? I dumped right after merger lol and didn‚Äôt look back
I guess. But I just think it‚Äôs a fools game to try and time the market. Unless there‚Äôs a crazy good catalyst. 

I try to go for all intrinsic volatility. Wait for a nice dip. Get some options 4-6 months out. And if it dips again significantly, double down to lower the average cost. 

Then you don‚Äôt have to panic over a single day. You have the luxury to wait a week and see what happens. 

Not the fastest get rich quick scheme but it‚Äôs better than just buying stock.

Hell yeah. Even better. Use the pain as motivation. Cry when you need to (in private obviously). Rage when you need to. Take ownership for your faults and nothing more. Realize anyone that would fuck you over is better off gone from your life. Your brain will know this faster than your heart and soul. I know that pain. I‚Äôve gone through it twice. It sucked both times equally. But the second time I knew what to do. It‚Äôs a cliche cause it fucking works. The key is to get outside and exercise. Eat real food only. No processed shit. Seriously. And sleep a full 8 hrs if you can. Get on a routine. Pick exercises you can do EVERY DAY. there are zero rest days in your future. Even if it‚Äôs just a walk around the block. Fucking do it. You have a real opportunity to push for a better life now. You got this
It‚Äôs a true story. Broke my fucking garage door last night right off the rails. I got a stronger gun, I‚Äôm a simple mountain man that loves trading FD‚Äôs. I‚Äôm not trying to kill the bear. I just want it to fuck off. It got into my chicken coop 2 years ago and killed 9 of my chickens. Could have killed it then. But I understand I live where I do and bears are part of this environment. I don‚Äôt want to kill bears. I just want them to get lost. My 30-06 would do the trick. But I got rubber buck shot so I can hoot and holler at them while they run away, only to one day seen them again. But I‚Äôm pretty fucking close to have a bear rug in my god damn mountain log cabin estate

You are delusional to think today was not a major event regarding the debt ceiling.  We were never going to default but this was getting to the point to where it would freak investors out.  That was taken off the table.

Keep loss/gain. even though I prefer loss as they keep these real, we can let the downvotes and upvoted decide.

Definitely remove YOLOs and keep them in the popular threads. This limits pump and dump and group think.

It gets tiring seeing random ppl posting "YOLOs" on shares from 5k to 20k to 200k. Just pointless and doesn't really add to the discussion and sub.

Tbh I have used large balance transfers for like ten years. My cc room is like 50k on a single card. You just have to be careful of the transfer fee. It used to be 0.99% but most now show me 3%.  If .99% then you‚Äôre good. It‚Äôs cheap margin. Usually have 1yr of that rate and I‚Äôve never not been able to roll it over. I‚Äôve used that to prepay my mortgage at a lower rate, for business, not for stocks.
I think Webull starts at 4 AM
yeah once your bal is &gt;25k they dont gaf
I should have specified cheap though.
If you have over 2k they will. Maybe not on penny stocks though.
Smart bears were positioned for this, are taking profits and using higher volatility to our advantage. I've been killing it since Sept 1st. Next..reposition for the next move over the next month. Hell...I might swing long for a bit.

Statistically true. Intra-day range might be high on some stocks. But in the past few years, if you bought at close and sole at open you‚Äôd be up 500%. If you bought open and sold close, I think you‚Äôd be down 2%. 

The problem with intraday is timing. Timing the bottom is impossible. It‚Äôs random, and no algorithm can predict it. 

Best bet is to play support levels and pray (mildly poor strategy) or use statistical averaging to build a position near the bottom. Good strategy but requires doubling down a lot, which can get expensive very fast.
So bullshit that most gains are pre market and only the big boys can trade them, we just get their scraps

I don't place much weight on futures, that's your assumption.

I didn't say anywhere futures are always correct or even a solid indicator. We agree more than might have been apparent, I only objected to you putting words in my mouth. 

Good luck to you as well.
cash advance would be one way, but 0 apr deals might not apply to them, have to look
I didn‚Äôt say use them now, I said use them
‚ÄúAs green as futures are now‚Ä¶ they were this red at the same time yesterday‚Ä¶ and we all saw how the last session went‚Ä¶ so therefore anything could happen tomorrow‚Ä¶ red is a strong possibility.‚Äù -and other lies I tell myself while I hold my puts until they dwindle to nothing
MOON or DOOM?
Fucker ate my wife pumpkin cake we put in the deep freezer in the garage last night. Looks like he came back for more. If he keeps it up he will be in my deep freezer. I‚Äôm in a bear hunting kinda mode right now. Fucker needs to go into hibernation, or ber will get fuked
Not true - dems haven‚Äôt even gotten a formal offer on the table yet. Market had a technical correction mostly driven by spiking interest rates and a rising dollar coupled with forecasting reduction in fed monetary policy. Yields and dollar still climbing right, jobs report on Friday to all but seal the deal for tapering now this shit is far from over.
Sounds like y‚Äôall need money but all I need is a philly cheese steak, my balls licked, and a blunt. #schmood

/ES are futures for the S&amp;P 500, SPY is an ETF that tracks the 500, so kinda the same but not.

I saw someone jerking off in someone's yard, looking through the window at some dude fucking his octogenarian housekeeper.

Shit delivery. Perfectly good joke ruined.

Schroedinger gets pulled over. The officer gets his license and registration and says "whats in the trunk?"

Schroedinger replies "a hooker". The officer asks him to pop the trunk. He circles to the back of the car and radios for backup. He approaches Schroedinger with his gun drawn and says "the hooker in your trunk is dead".

Schroedinger replies "Well of course she is now!"

Not true. The market has a ton of range intra day right now. Plus when your stack is huge you don‚Äôt need to yolo for 50% every play.
If amazon did a 25:1 split to have the same share price as Apple their market cap would quickly double.

I got a question. I have a margin account with Schwab and my balance went below 25k last week. I transferred 1k and it settles tomorrow. I havent done a single trade since it went below 25k. Why the hell is schwab telling me I need to call them to discuss my margin account? Also I never used the borrowed money. Only had it switched to a margin account so I can day trade.
Flu or Covid bro.

Not to mention AMZN has less than half the price to sales ratio of APPL. It needs a split badly.

Done. Read it and only two comments i have is why do you downvote, and why place so much weight on future market for how the market will play out that day? I can‚Äôt win this argument cause you can point to any event to explain why the market moved from said news event. A lesson I learned and continue to relearn is that futures market is nothing but noise. Once market opens, the flood gates open and so long as rates don‚Äôt move significantly, there is only one game in town, the market. In short, you place to much weight on futures. Whether the futures were correct, not you nor I can claim one way or another. Good luck my friend

I don‚Äôt give a fuck about futures. Cash overnight right now to minimize risk. Tech was -1.5% at 7 AM this morning and finished green as balls. I‚Äôll take my trade after 11:30 AM even a 1% gain will pay the mortgage.

Bet mango is doing it too. You‚Äôre not a hero for shorting China you‚Äôre a fucking idiot, money doesn‚Äôt see race never forget that.

Copy and pasting my concerns from another thread 

&gt;!I have some minor gripes stemmed from episode 2 like how werent there enough missing persons case reported that made them track down the source of these people getting in vans? Since most of them got out surely some of them would have reported it to the police besides Gi-hun and actually have a proper response? If the young officer could easily follow them during the second time then why weren't there more similar "infiltrations"? If this was going on since the 90's how come they manage to get away with it every single time, every single year? What happened to the previous winners and why didn't they try or attempt to put damage to the games (its obviously clear they didnt given how easy going the masked people were taking their victims to the site cause the officer could follow them without raising any alarms)!&lt;
Spot on
38 year old dude here. What countries and states are 16 year girls legal in? Asking for a 16 year old friend who's just curious, I promise.
Read my mind. Let it rip so we can close our calls, open up puts as it falls and then double down on calls before market close
Used my weekly call gains on Coinbase to buy nov 19 3500 Amazon calls. I really hope this 20k doesn‚Äôt burn a hole in my pocket
High risk, high reward. Market isn't in a definite uptrend yet. Might want to open a small position now and scale into it considering how the market goes in the next week or two.

Birdbox wasnt that bad
Because it‚Äôs fair value is like 350 and it‚Äôs trading at 150?? Not rocket science people went full retard this year on China stocks
Think three might be a few ramifications of doing that...but nothing to stop them. In this case tho they would need to sell some of the balance sheet to raise cash. Bond market/stock market wouldnt like that.
Damn my Reddit lagging üòî
30%?

Imagine being a bear and locking in prodits the last week. Not one loss on my short plays. I've posted the buys and sells. Back to having a lot of cash but have been doing pretty well on swing trades. Will see how it looks tomorrow. Not going to swing long much yet.
Honestly, 4.5% in 7 trading days is doable. If indeed ~$427 was the bottom of this dip. I have no bias bedsides what would be the lottos I‚Äôm holding with a strike that‚Äôs halfway their and expiry 2 more weeks out lol.

Why doesn't congress just vote to reset the debt? The Fed owns most of it anyway. They can just start over, pass $10T in stimulus, and order the fed to buy all the bonds. I bet that would be agreeable to both parties.

From there it‚Äôs been a lot of up and downs. Something to keep me busy at work mostly. 

Ngl though I‚Äôve been close to losing it all multiple times lmao
Futures look great,.so that means market takes a dump tomorrow. Recent trend anyway. Although this time does look and feel a little different. Regardless I'm sure I will lose more money.

Yup. Same with SF (I‚Äôm from sac). Moved to Texas and never ever leaving.
Well, it‚Äôs complicated. McConnell said he would ‚Äúallow‚Äù Democrats to use normal means to extend the default date until December. If all democrats agree to this it will most likely pass but then we just have the same stalemate in December instead of now. Personally I would find it hilarious if Sinema tanks the whole thing just because she wants to see the world burn. Of course the details of this deal aren‚Äôt hammered out yet and the republicans could still sneak something the Democrats wouldn‚Äôt like into it and it could be called off again

The way OI on Friday SPY options are set up, this could get awful spicy if we open up tomorrow.
Tomorrow, start my day with a large glass of ice water, a stretch, jog and a cold shower.

Breakfast time, 3 eggs, oatmeal with berries.  8 fl. oz coffee, twice.  Get in my car and listen to ber are fuk by margin called.  Proceed to work a few hours.

Lunch time, Grilled chicken breast over a voluptuous green salad with balsamic vinaigrette, finish the work day strong.  Check the market as I get into my car for the ride home and listen to some more ber are fuk (great song).

Snack time, raw broccoli salad with some V8 vegetable juice.  Onto mowing the lawn and other activities while my wife cooks dinner in her lulu leggings, PAWG.

Dinner time, Pan seared salmon with a pear brandy reduction, side of mashed potatoes and greens beans with almond slices.  After dinner settles, hang on my inversion table while doing an in depth analysis of why frogs make noise at night.  After about an hour or so of lounge time, 100 pushups, 100 squats, 100 situps, 10 pullups followed by a protein shake.

Dessert, munch on my wife's carpet until my tongue cramps, brush my teeth and get some sleep

I started in my account with 250 dollars. I am up 10k. This is my fun account. My real shit is done for me through merril lynch. 

I always tell my self at what point am I going to stop fucking with options and start just buying stocks. I look through the list for hours at a time adding it to my ‚Äúbuy‚Äù watch list. 

I feel like options have fucked my sense of the stock market though. I look short term. A month at most. So when I look at stock to buy I think ‚Äúyeah 2 weeks from now this probably will lose value‚Äù 

Maybe it‚Äôs time I just yeet it all on 0dte spy calls and either make a sick paycheck or hit 0 and call it quits.

When I first started out a month before lockdowns I 5x my portfolio but proceeded to lose it all within a month which is why I swore off SPY options unless it was an absolutely huge drop with an imminent bounce incoming which I've been getting good at recognizing. Emotions are gonna kill your trading, once I dissociated stocks from my feelings and went off purely numbers is when I found success. Type in finviz dot com and look up your stocks on there, I mainly look at the RSI (14) part of a stock to see if it's oversold. Anything under 30 is considered oversold recently which means a bounce should be coming. I go off this purely and never think "Oh this stock will do really well in a year." I get in and out asap. Everyone has their own strategy though and you might find your own that works best for you. Hope this helps. Good luck.

Evidence seems pretty thin, the cypher can be solved with multiple names apparently. I‚Äôll believe it when/if they get DNA evidence
Some stocks don‚Äôt recover.
It's actually pretty simple to understand: All of the bias on this sub about there being a massive crash was based on fearporn and a generalized belief that the stock market is "too big" and that a collection of problems can totally bring the market down into a flash crash. If that happened, we'd be flash crashing all the time. In reality, what we've seen isn't even a correction (which would require a reduction of &gt;10% of the market) and so what we've been watching is a series of re-alignment in the market largely related to a combination of generalized fear and mostly due to funds and institutions rebalancing their portfolios at the beginning of this quarter and in preparation for the holiday season combined with rebalancing to reflect the current economic realities. (reopening, better bond rates, etc)

Bonds are a risk offset, so in risk models buying bonds creates room for greater risk investment as capital expands into the market... so expect any bond purchasing glut to be followed up by a rally not long after.

If expansion of the bond market resulted in decline in the stock market, the last decade would have been the stock market drilling into the earth, but it was the opposite because bonds trading opposite to stocks is a short term phenomenon... once that's done, bond growth grows the stock market.

you decide that on your own tbh. whatever you're comfortable losing. worst thing to do is beat yourself up for selling too soon for a loss or a profit. if i miss out on 200% profit but i got 75%, i'm happy af. also, i'm happier because i stuck to my guns about selling for a profit. it's like that feeling of not cheating your diet. then when i'm at a 50% loss and i sell and then the next hour it drops to a 100% loss, i'm happy because i jumped off a ship. sure, that 50% loss could have become a 100% gain, but in the end i stuck to my strat.

Yep. If you play earnings (honestly don‚Äôt but if you do), figure out the Vega beforehand. That‚Äôs the expected move volatility wise. If your actual move &lt; Vega, you‚Äôre getting IV crushed. IV crush also happens when an underlying moves rapidly and then slows down (if a stock moves 40% one day and then 1% the next, you‚Äôre losing IV value on the 1% day). MMs = marker markers.

That's the conventional wisdom, but any dip from tapering will be a short term pattern. It didn't happen last time they did tapering, and it didn't happen last time they did rate hikes... not in anything beyond a short term period. Tapering and rate increases have, at this point, been pantomimed to death over the past year.. I.e. the definition of priced in.

Here's what will happen when the tapering occurs or becomes a near future reality: There will be a short period of volatility, similar to what we've had recently, maybe a lot less than that because I think people are underestimating the debt ceiling issue and how markets get freaked out about the potential for government default... then you're right that bond yields will increase and this will feed a similar kind of event that we saw recently, but then it will stop and growth will continue.

The reason it will stop and then growth will continue is because tapering won't actually remove any capital from the market, it just slows the expansion... which could reduce the size of the market if there wasn't a fucking gargantuan amount of capital sitting unused in banks and funds right now. There's a common misconception by people on here who don't do research that all of the M2 money is in the market... it isn't, but it's slowly being released into it. So tapering doesn't actually stop the growth mechanism.

Even rate increases will stay around the 1-2% mark most likely and that won't put significant reductive pressure on the stock market in any real sense, which is why they didn't tank the market over the last decade.

What about the bond situation? Isn't that money leaving the market? If it worked like that, the overall value of the market would have decreased as the bond market exploded over the past decade... but it didn't, it exploded in concert with it. That's because bonds are a risk anchor, and as such they actually enable higher risk investment. In the initial cycle, increasing bond rates may draw funds out of the market, which is what people mean when they say that stocks usually trade opposite to bonds... but in the next cycle bonds promote the growth of the stock market because of that risk offset facet. Bonds provide safe return, but not significant return, and they have a hard time keeping up with inflation.

This is where the jobs report comes in. If the jobs report is good, then that will mean slowly increasing economic factors in the next year. I expect this quarter and probably the next will be awash with volatility due to pumped up expectations resulting in negative surprises that are still usually going to be really good growth numbers... but that will alleviate because eventually things will find equilibrium, and expansion of good jobs will increase capital velocity causing that to happen. 

Nobody's going to leave all that risk-on'ed now-protect-by-bond-offset capital on the table when there's volatility in the market. The end result is a convergence pattern, not the divergence patterned needed for an actual market crash.

Hell you can see the facets of that process in the past month. To people not paying attention, we "just had a crash" but crashes require far more than a 20% correction and a systemic cause.... what we just had wasn't even a correction, which would require a 10% reduction in the market. Hell, SPY found support at a much higher level than it did last September... to match the correction last year, it would have had to have dropped below $407... and it came nowhere close. Every bond expansion day resulted in a rally the next day, and that's because of this conflicting dynamic, along with the fact that much of the past few weeks, as evidenced in indexes that track these things, was actually a pretty ordered re-alignment of positions for funds at the beginning of this quarter. 

In any case, the train will chug forward... just at a slower, more volatile pace... because the capital machine continues to churn.

What do you guys do for fun?
take profits when you can and cut loss when you have to. you'll never get a mental boom if you went in knowing *how would i feel if this loses big*. go in knowing what you do with a loss and with a win.

I'm only going based on what I've heard from everyone else who trades options. I've seen it on here all the time. One big win and then the account eventually gets blown up along with all the winnings.

Hammertime?
E-mini futures options or SPX options 24/6 coming soon this fall. ThinkOrSwim is great for it. you‚Äôll usually get cleaned out by theta trading overnight bc some of these are European style and pretty pricy from the contract multipliers, but these past few weeks have been great for swings. You can get reduced futures margin requirements by hedging with options too

I played Amazon earnings once. It mooned. Woke up the next day ready to collect thousands ‚Ä¶ market opens, and I‚Äôm down 89% and MMs fucked me sideways via IV crush. Sucked for the weekend, but you get over it
1 million, he'll no.  I aint no trick hoe.
I dont think it has been done before. I cannot imagine the system operating quietly in a world in which the USG has defaulted, I don't think you can "revamp" the global financial system in that way without causing something like a great depression, and I am confident enough in that to go absolutely max levered on credit card loans on that bet.

If you want to play the 100,000:1 odds, go buy USG CDX which will pay out ~70,000:1 in case of default. $1000 bet would get you $70 million

No...the management restructuring will pull it up and I believe the recall rollout units will be hugely improved.  This will lead to improved sentiment and given its shorted position when it pops it should move fairly rapidly.   Just my thoughts. But hey...I admit I'm truly retarded

I don't care if you're in military or who you claimed you worked with. If you're caught too close and someone has a knife: You are done. You know this. I know this.

But, my evidence is automatically deemed "cherry picked" anyway, so who gives a crap? I'm not gonna convince you. So, why do you keep hammering this?

Jesus lol, you shouldn‚Äôt be anticipating big loses! If you do, ffs steer clear of options
lmk how the drive thru is at that one
Yes.   Artificially inflated.   Will happen in last qtr of the year.   Supply chain is fucked and companies will post lower earnings to come. 2023 first qtr will be ugly as well.
They need to let us trade options after hours. You know how many great ideas I come up with that I should have done like 3 minutes after the closing bell.
The housing market goes first and the rest follows.

Imagine using the metric system.
Puts on NFLX, last time it peaked to $616 I bought a few contracts and made about $2k (off of about $4k principal). The RSI is high and even though I think markets go higher tomorrow, I think that this pulls backs over the next 5 trading days at least to around $610. Don't take out a second mortgage, but a good $1-2K play looks like a winner
I don't care if you have billions to invest, you aren't changing market forces and price action on major indexes. Might as well make money however the market is going.

The jobs report actually does not solve the supply chain issues. The supply chain issues go beyond labor and into people who can‚Äôt work because of Covid or who won‚Äôt work because of government subsidies. Hiring is irrelevant. The supply chain issue still persists, it has not been solved and will not be solved until likely 2023. Prices are going to continue to go up, severely. You are already paying more for food, it will hit clothing and electronics soon. There will be no escape from inflation and it will not be transitory. Prices will not mysteriously drop again in the future.

I think I'm a fucking clown for not realizing this. A better job report doesn't mean inflation will run hot. But it solves the supply chain issues, which the FED fear the most, and inflation will not be transitory if this problem persists. TLDR: Better job report =&gt; supply chain issues solved =&gt; inflation transitory (supply bottleneck) =&gt; Yields down =&gt; stonks ATH.  
Also, the debt ceiling issue will most likely be delayed until Dec 21.

You guys probably don't remember u/findmyshark but the dude was an absolute legend. [Made 238k off of 4k in a month off NVDA puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9qskir/went_all_in_on_nvda_puts_again) He broke 100k and everyone told him to stop. Then he YOLOed every last cent of that into the same thing the next week and won. He later short text posted he lost it all (probably just lied so his inbox would stop blowing up) and deleted the account anyways. I like to think he's still here shitposting away. Just crazy to think how 4k can become life changing.

I've never installed Tinder. Would you rate it 5 stars out of 5?
modern day cleopatra right here
It's not real until you realize it
well let's just be clear on what we're talking about. The thing everyone's afraid of is the day the government runs out of cash to pay out P&amp;I on treasuries. That would place the USG technically in default and paying its creditors in arrears giving it a credit rating of D automatically. The entire global financial system is built on the risk-free rate of US treasuries as its core axiom. Every type of investment is compared o the rock-bottom risklessness of USTs in every valuation model for every asset class in the world. It is a huge component of basically every institutional portfolio. If the USG defaults, all that gets instantly turned on its head. A D rating = instant mass dumping of treasuries on the order of trillions of dollars. And a lot of that would be legally mandated, as many funds cannot hold D rated credit. That would mean rates rip to  idk? 5% on the 10Y? 10%? Stocks would circuit breaker just for that reason even taking out the psychological component, spreads would rip, credit markets would completely seize up, lending would go to 0, need I go on

You might be, but that doesn‚Äôt mean she thinks so. I didn‚Äôt think you brought it up, I figured she did.

Puts are always a bad idea
The taper is a definite at this point. I agree we'll never default but that doesn't remove uncertainty/risk adjustment on the off chance we do. The supply chain risk isn't cordoned off to one industry. I.e. Less goods being sold=less money moving around= less money spent on cloud Software. And I'm willing to bet banks are riskier now than in 08. Increasingly lower rates means you have to take on more risk for the same return. I'm taking the opposite position. May the best man win. ü§ù

Realizing when the market is overvalued due to many factors has nothing to do with betting against America. As a matter of fact, if someone makes a ton of money as the market goes down they can help American people through volunteer work.
Agree jobs reports is further evidence of Nov 4 taper news, which likely *will* drop the market (but I'm not convicted enough to go all-in short).

I think debt ceiling theatrical are totally overblown regardless of any deal, extension, or deadline. The US will not default. I'm too old and remember this shit during Bush/Obama. There is always an 11th hour deal.

I'm a tech bull so supply chain issues just helps me. Cloud software ain't shipped. Fuck the dow. 

China to me is a wildcard. I think US institutions *may* be insulated enough (via swaps). Guess it depends on if banks' risk departments learned anything in 2008.

I think the VIX volatility will traverse the channel at least once more before the Nov taper drop (if there is one). I'll pay for it if I'm wrong; leveraged to the tits.

Best answer
Why it smells like the TLRY comments are from bag holders -  I bought when it was hyped on here several months back.  It is down 67% since then.  I only put in $100 so it's not a huge deal... but I imagine all these suckers trying to hype it up again put in a lot more and have been buying this whole time trying to average down.   Heavy heavy HEAVY bags - they'll probably jerk you off behind that dumpster over there if it'll convince you to buy.

Whatever looks oversold but my favorite picks rn are KO VZ calls, ZNGA WISH RKT BB DIDI shares. Keep in mind I'm day trading these, meaning i sell asap whenever I'm in the green so I usually scalp 1-5% on the shares. Options usually get me a little more. The KO calls I bought today are up 40% already lol but I'm gonna be selling those tmrw

Can we just go into the next great depression already? I'm ready for the next great bull run.
Wdym? Oil just went down a bit, I suspect a combination of profit taking and also news of releasing some barrel from the strategic reserve to calm the price increases. Tbh that won‚Äôt be enough if we have a cold winter and we should still chug toward $90 a barrel. Nat gas is currently waaayy to expensive and most countries will resort to burning heating oil instead. OPEC clearly isn‚Äôt going to help with the supply issue and the ones in power here can‚Äôt open the taps for political reasons.

**[1998 Russian financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis)** 
 
 &gt;The Russian financial crisis (also called ruble crisis or the Russian flu) hit Russia on 17 August 1998. It resulted in the Russian government and the Russian Central Bank devaluing the ruble and defaulting on its debt. The crisis had severe impacts on the economies of many neighboring countries. Meanwhile, James Cook, the senior vice president of The U.S. Russia Investment Fund, suggested the crisis had the positive effect of teaching Russian banks to diversify their assets.

C'mon, one more rug pull for old time's sake.
10 year already going back up. Good jobs reports have always spiked yields and hit growth for the past few months. Powell already said it would take basically one good jobs report for the standards to be met to start tapering. Starting tapering will contribute to weakness in bonds. Weakness in bonds spikes yields. Rate hikes will be next and bonds are historically a bad place to be during rate increases.

Long Crazy story short i‚Äôve been trading on PDT for a while until I‚Äôm free next month &amp; I pretty much yolod on a OTM call yesterday cause you know it‚Äôs google but this morning was too chaotic, sold was going to hop back in but couldn‚Äôt risk playing a OTM call again with this kangaroo market so I just got another call with something else‚Ä¶&amp; tbh I feel like it sort of all worked out for the most part but damn you know google TENDIES are the best lmaooo

Probably ends with another dead-end and more time burned, if I'm being realistic. I don't think Dems will accept this condition and Reps won't allow the ceiling raised if they don't.

But, optimistically, I'd put money down on Reps bending again to the Dems. Slightly bullish.

Basically, the Reps will only budge on this if the Dems agree to a temporary ceiling raise, right?

But, the Reps want to reconcile the budget. Democrats don't want to do that, because it'd make them all go through more voting, plus "*using the budget process would force Democrats to specify the amount they'd raise the debt limit by*" and they don't want to do that.

According to Bernie Sanders, "*There's not going to be reconciliation*."
I wish I had the cash for long OTM puts on mara, riot, coin and even hood.  That thing they make money on is an obvious scam.  I just wish I had the leverage to wait it out.

At this point I can't tell if you're trolling, high as fuck, drunk, or delusional. So instead I'll just wish you luck but 452 tomorrow isn't happening. Now you said your calls are 10/15, that actually does have a chance of making you money, but it ain't happening tomorrow.

Yeah, kinda like on CNBC bunch of people saying tapering doesn‚Äôt matter but in 2020 the reason markets went up they said was ‚Äúbecause Fed is pumping money in.‚Äù  It‚Äôs one or the other.
Buying calls yesterday was the move
Never too late to buy more TQQQ in celebration üöÄ
Best of luck to you too!
Nice.
We'll dump tomorrow, I'm not scared. This was just the rally for the short-term extension.

Dipshit that'a not how this works. There is no guarantee we see 350 again that's why you say fuck it and go long at all time highs, but dont do it with all your money so you can also buy the dip if it does happen
How are puts on sale if you go down tomorrow? Won‚Äôt iv go up?
Now It‚Äôs the time to buy some would say
It‚Äôs a pretty solid effort actually, I enjoyed it.
How
We need a complete purge.
You really need to stop spamming your shit. No one cares. It won't hit. And if it does, good on you. Im sure plenty of people here have lottos.
pick some up this morning
Futures are often fake but I've got a feeling these aren't.
SKLZ:

Glad I doubled down on spy calls when I noticed the gay vibes in here near close. LFG üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Puts going on sale again for tomorrow. Don‚Äôt forget we are trending down.
there's nothing better than ur options itm and getting drunk knowing tomorrow will be fine
Has anybody seen the new Chappelle special? Think I'm gonna subscribe just to watch that.

In September we had a total of 12 green days in the entire month. This month we already have 3 green days under our belt with 4 trading days gone.
I just threw up all of my Wendy‚Äôs I ate earlier
OTM calls and puts on day 1 and did 3 day trades.. then had about $200... then went down to $46 the next day but then recovered to $380.. today started out at $115.. then by EOD I was $960. 

Will take some profits then try to get doubling til i get to 1 Billion. Should work right?
If only I bought SPY 437c expiring 10/08 instead of today, I would've actually gained value. Guess I'll try again next time.
He thinks he‚Äôs gonna see a +5% move on a sell the news event.

His issue is he doesn‚Äôt get that ‚Äúif everyone knows‚Äù then it‚Äôs priced in. If it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsure thing‚Äù it‚Äôs already priced in.
did you though

Don't let bears distract you from the fact that SPY was green 3 out of the last 4 days.
What can you even buy for $50?
You trade the news or the reaction to the news? Retards will be relieved by the good news and rush to buy "cheap" stuff. And institutions unload the dog shit into them. Muahahahaha
Honestly we are just going to go back to normal interest rates lol
Now I just need the market to slowly move higher instead of ripping to ATH in 2 days
So inflation is transitory and prices are just going to stop magically going up?
Sector rotation out of my portfolio.

Or not.
Ok listen. Open up your SPY chart. Find the last time SPY moved 15$ in 1 direction in 24 hours. Realize 452 tomorrow is a fucking La la land dream.

Will the market go Bull mode due to the debt ceiling news that literally everyone with a brain knew was coming? Yeah probably. Will it climb back toward ATH in 1 fucking day? Absolutely not.
Doesn‚Äôt matter exp is far

But you continued on your high horse.  Im no fucking bull but y'all are dumb for hating America.
I've got 7 10/15 $450 calls. Originally had 2, but more than tripled up when the price dropped. I hope it does hit $452 tomorrow. If it does I'll skim off to get back to even then let the rest ride.
If it‚Äôs in a perfect Irish accent I‚Äôll guild it

Yeah I noticed it to, thats why I have no clue. I held my calls because it didnt seem like we hit that ceiling. However if we open green tomorrow I will switch to puts. Deff not holding anything over the weekend except maybe puts

The ECB is playing with fire. Natural gas prices are spiking and likely to get worse depending on winter. The ECB has condemned their economy with ultra loose monetary policy. We saw the Yellow Jacket Movement on France in 2018 (which started out as far right but expanded) because people were not happy with low wages and high costs (also gas prices). Things are much worse. What happens when you have civil unrest. 

The Fed will taper because otherwise they would have to wait until January to announce a taper, which means it wouldn‚Äôt start until February. If the Fed was to announce an emergency meeting this would scare the market. I‚Äôm telling you the Fed will announce a taper next month.

Because of their issues with population growth, they changed it to three children. 

That‚Äôs why they nationalized online tutoring: They want to incentivize people to have larger families, and that means making education more affordable. 

Also, the one child policy was never enforced all that strictly. Wealthy Chinese people bribed government officials all the time.

Honestly the only people bearish on China are racists or people being forced to because they work for the US government. China is a much safer bet than the US as unpopular and unpatriotic of a fact that it is. China has their shit together and doesn‚Äôt have two parties acting like high schoolers. What the CCP did is insanely bullish for their middle class and only true economists and investors will understand why. Let dumbasses remain blind you really can‚Äôt help them, there‚Äôs no way to cure racism and hatred sadly
Why are Africa poor? We should help them.
Looks like we're going to open above 440 tomorrow morning unless Asia pulls a Leroy Jenkins and tanks everything.
Idk what FUBO is but I bought some and don‚Äôt hate it
There‚Äôs like one girl out of 10,000 who loves it but she‚Äôs a 5/10 and doesn‚Äôt even let you do it in her butt, definitely not worth it.

Whats dick cheese
You haven‚Äôt swallowed your tongue yet, so you‚Äôve got that going for you
Why kill the cash cow when you can keep milking it?
all i remember is logi printed fat a while back,

I like to imagine the stock exchange actually just runs setup on SQL server 2000 and hasnt been updated since and the tables could lockup at any moment because someone forgot to force the logs to recycle and it finally ran out of space.
What is dick cheese in medical terms
Imagine having a 1 child limit and seeing the middle class go back down to 39.1 million
They blinked. That's the important part. Yeah, it may be in the news in December, but why are they gonna let it default in December if they weren't willing to today?
He means there is 0 chance SPY rips that hard in such little time. Which there‚Äôs a 99.99% chance he‚Äôs correct. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt making that‚Äù
Like getting us a addicted to nicotine, sugar, fat, alcohol, do you think they‚Äôre getting us addicted to stonks, only to take it all away?
Apparently I missed some memo about fall decor and everyone‚Äôs house looks nicer than mine rn
Actual pro tip: no girl likes dick cheese..... WASH YO DICK
The yo-yo on the five day chart doesn‚Äôt jive with what‚Äôs supposed to have gotten the market nervous. Ok I get interest rates, and shutdown fearmongering, but up then down then up?

All week so far spy has been hitting a ceiling and diving back down. Then trying again. We closed today near that ceiling. Question is if Thursday can hold or we diving again. Five day chart don‚Äôt make sense, so who knows.
Some fuck face last night on this thread kept ruining the show for everyone. He told everyone the ending and the twist. I was seriously livid
Do you even realize how important raising the debt ceiling is?! There‚Äôs literally a financial crisis here on the line.
Kinda wish Thiel was more at the forefront with Palantir like Musk is with Tesla
Yeah, they are the people who lost everything and don‚Äôt post here anymore.
My unprofessional advice would probably be inclined towards anthrax
I think my run of luck is about to end bigly :/
Eat a payday
Well then you might as well cover the entire continent why stop with just the USA
If you are perma anything in the market, you are a retard
The sharp pain was always there you were just too drunk to feel it. Congrats Bro!
Is that the "+" in the abbreviation?  It's confusing
They passed the debt ceiling we big time good
*puts queso quietly back in fridge*

Guess I won‚Äôt use it
Yeah I didn‚Äôt buy eod because I was waiting for it to do it‚Äôs typical dump. Of course the one time I want it to it doesn‚Äôt.
Bear extinct lol
We'll know after earnings tomorrow. I bought 10 FDs today just in case.
Im short the QQQs right at resistance. Paid nicely today on 0dte 358s almost hit 100%. 

If it goes 360 I‚Äôll switch to calls with a strike if 365 then dump them on the bulls.

Logi is a good play honestly

Is that show worth watching?

Ah, ok. I was thinking of a different expiration date
#YES WE DO
‚ÄúBased on Pew's income band classification, China's middle class has been among the fastest growing in the world, swelling from 39.1 million people (3.1 percent of the population) in 2000 to roughly 707 million (50.8 percent of the population) in 2018.‚Äù

Imagine being a üåàüá®üá≥üêª.
At $450 it‚Äôs $12,070
Nice. If SPY goes to $899 I'm a millionaire. Though that doesn't seem like much anymore
Creepy church lady Bev, from Midnight Mass, is actually Jen Psaki. 

More puts on the sleepy administration.
Why are they booing you? You're right
GM sounds pissed at Tesla....probably some money to be made  in EV tech and infrastructure plays as the competition heats up.  I might try to make some short term bets on EVGO calls....but fuck chargepoint I am done with that crap. GM will probably want a new battery supplier also....
It‚Äôs not hitting 450 tomorrow
Alright let me break Friday‚Äôs Non-Farm Payroll/Unemployment Rate for you all.

Surprise to the upside (better than expected) = Economy Recovering Faster = Markets dump because taper

Surprise to the downside = slowing recovery = markets rip because more free money for corporate bond sellers.
well being a bear in this market certainly isn't making ppl money this past year

All the particles it dissolve could dislodge clots and go to the heart and cause a heart attack

[deleted]
Do you get the urge to put it in your mouth?
Except that's never gonna happen
I would be at around 12k in profit. Love to dream but 440 is the most likely. Maybe 442
Alright, time to settle a curiosity of mine. Is there really such a thing as permabears and permabulls on wsb ?
Can't wait to see earnings estimates but I think LOGI is going to be a medium risk but high reward play. Most analysts have given them straight awful reviews the past month growth has slowed and they're right to do so. 


That said if this sentiment carries over to earnings expectations, (which they have beaten every fucking time), the estimates are going to be so low their average earnings could just blow it sky high.
I got 34 contracts of $450C 10/15, do the math if you don‚Äôt believe me.
You can be a straight guy and love sucking dick. Yes, we exist
this sara eisen slander is something id not tolerate, theres bers who say psaki is hot and you go off on sara smh

Doubt it
Yeah you‚Äôre fucked. Sit the hell down.
Did you not read in my first comment where I already said I was buying calls tomorrow if we‚Äôre green?
Lol no. You ever hear her speak
I have a considerable amount of contradicting data on this issue.

Well it was genius for us that bought spy puts at 454 lol, but I already took my fat gains and bought some dip. Bears being bears now are a bit late
Get a job and trade spy calls ‚Ä¶..pussy!
cognitive dissonance.   prepare to get your face ripped off
Gotta wait until at least 2:01
&gt;Inflation is a very real thing, and ultra loose monetary policy isn‚Äôt making things better.

We know this, but that doesn't matter because the fed ultimately makes the decision and so far they have said they dont give a shit about inflation.

The ECB is even worse, going as far as to say that monetary policy doesn't affect energy prices lol.

"ECB'S Lagarde: We Will Pay Close Attention To Wage Developments And Inflation Expectations To Ensure That Inflation Expectations Are Anchored At 2%

\- We Should Not Overreact To Supply Shortages Or Rising Energy Prices, As Our Monetary Policy Cannot Directly Affect Those Phenomena"

The only way we are seeing a taper next month is if the market recovers back to ATH, there is basically no chance in hell the fed will announce a taper if the markets stay choppy this month
Tell me more about this cheese lube

Did it work? Were there side effects?

God dammit, it's getting really bullish in here.

Yes. No cereal for anyone
fear of puts expiring worthless
Damn ok so you guys don't like Sara Eisen
Good, somebody has to keep the toddler population under control, they are a huge drain on the economy.

Guys I‚Äôm just commenting to update you that I‚Äôm still on strike
Calls on bigass spiders in fall. One spun a web from the fucking power lines to the ground at my house. I'm pretty positive they primarily eat toddlers.
What do we think tomorrow bros? Im skeptical about a green open. Held my calls cause im feeling good about them which probably means a meteor hits wall street tonight and we open at 0
Don't dip your weiner in the chili
Damn Sara Eisen looked stunning in that blue today
i suppose you weren't here the past two years for "markets are forward looking" almost every day
I sold my 10/15 429c today at 1:04....
What was the point of spy dumping so hard this morning? I was trying to buy a few calls 10 minutes before close and accidentally bought 8k worth of them. And then missed out on selling them before close. Hope it pumps a bit tomorrow

Imagine not using the same jokes...
Calls at close was abt the easiest trade of the yr

#Pro tip


When purchasing a stock make sure to buy first and research the company later especially when it starts going down so you know what you just became a "long term" investor in.
Well I sure called that fake premarket dump into the jobs number beat. Glad my main stocks all finished nice and green
Debt ceiling. McConnell provided a way to extend for a few months *at minimum*, so the threat of default dissolved. Not that there was any threat, but it made a good storyline for MMs to push via CNBC.

Let's be real. Nobody gives a fuck about China junk bonds and JPow has *not* announced tapering, and *can't* until Nov 4 FOMC. 

So bulls run until smart money pulls the rug sometime before Nov 4 (or, it's priced in and MMs will eat retail shorts on the obvious play).
[deleted]
Yo imagine being a bear ok

JPow only has to say the word and it would happen.
Gotta risk it. I‚Äôve still got some upside positions, but majority is short. Between inflation, supply side shortages, and the fed‚Äôs balance sheet, I can‚Äôt be bullish. Just a dumbass‚Äôs opinion on Reddit though üòÇ

Uhhh some of the fear and uncertainty has been removed.  Always more issues but less fear today than yesterday.

Big green tomorrow.  RIP üåàüêªs.
Likely due to the debt ceiling deal.   Not fixed all the way but a temporary solution.

If they get there infrastructure package done we could see a nice bump.
If I didn't jack off I'd probably explode in a flash of rage and flying cum one day. Most likely in line at the store

#BUY SNAKE OIL
nice editorialization of the headline

"Short-Term Debt Ceiling Hike" is what you left out

i.e. all they did was kick the can down the road so the uncertainty and worry isn't gone, which might actually be worse than if the band aid was just ripped off

now you get to hear about debt ceiling until December or later
Were they coupons for SPY?
[deleted]
I try to channel the feelings of the stock, I sit and mediate with spirit crystals and I ask the stock to speak with me
Thanks i was feeling bad about drinking a 6 pack 2x a week, this helps
gyna markets open tonight after holidays?
Is there some particular reason I‚Äôm not aware of for all this bull euphoria? I already said I would buy calls if we were green again tomorrow but it seems like everyone is absolutely positive we will be. What happened?
I'm actually such a fucking retard lol
They will be IV crushed
FWIW, I‚Äôm taking a more neutral position right now too. I‚Äôm selling covered calls in the money so that if there is more decline I still have some downside protection. I don‚Äôt think things are going to fall a lot more though. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt take a short position.
Looks like even Urban Meyer uses WSB for stock tips.

70 percent is institutional. 30 percent is retail. Historically retail was 15 percent. Have you not been around WSB? People buy stocks and have no idea about the company. I think you think this is r/investing

There are some people with an unhealthy relationship to pornography who should jack off less, but in general, I agree that masturbating is good and healthy.
Last second turn around. Open till 12 will be up up based on the fake news, then after 12 Mitch backs off and we end up -$6 for the day spy.
Was super bearish in here last night and we ended the day slightly green. Starting to think inverse wsb is not a meme.
Ya the big money sitting on the sidelines will definitely take its toll.  We have some rough days ahead of us..

They can rally all they want, but if I don't see SPY 440, I don't believe this is over.
Ok then we‚Äôre off by just under 5% from recent highs MTD. If bulls are considering this the pullback and doubling down, I‚Äôm fine with that. I just cannot rationalize investing at these levels with economic factors being inverted. I‚Äôll be right there with you once SPY pulls back a significant amount, but taking a short position for now.

Did someone say taper??? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Except inflation isn‚Äôt transitory. The Fed banked on inflation being transitory so it could run dovish policy, but this can‚Äôt continue. The Fed will have to taper and will have to raise interest rates in 2022. 

Inflation is a very real thing, and ultra loose monetary policy isn‚Äôt making things better. The Fed announce a taper in November
Okay, well good luck
#Pro tip


When trading stocks make sure to do no DD, no Technical analysis, don't check into fundamentals, simply trade based on feelings and emotions, this is the way.
IF It dumps it will be after Asian markets open‚Ä¶
Lol downvoted
Sure I agree playing micros and intraday. But, we learned bonds and yields aren‚Äôt being dictated by a debt ceiling extension. They will continue to be sold due to weakness and a market transitioning into rate hikes and reduced bond purchasing. 20 year looking like it‚Äôs headed back to over 1.6% again which is going to spook growth investors.
Which btw, they can do but we can't do, if we do that we get demonetized, half our views don't count, and we are removed or put on page50 in the search engines.

Well evening futures to me are useless.  Ya 55 Down just before open means something.  
Debt ceiling debacle is and was bound to get resolved .
It‚Äôs because you die quicker
Fellas, is it gay for your calls to go ITM?
Well, my $11 TLRY calls are ITM I'm gonna be so rich tomorrow

The problem here is that a solvent that would dissolve the plaques in your arteries would also dissolve your arteries. This is bad for the body.
I have no idea if this is comparable or not but I think I experienced something similar around the time I decided to quit. If you were drinking that much you may want to talk to your doctor about how to quit safely
Long-term? I think you have the wrong sub
The fact that you're still alive means you're good at something. One step at a time, my dude.
Why is it called 'fast' food? I can call my Chinese takeout place and place an order for the family special (for just me) and they'll tell me to be there in 10 minutes and make me feel like I'm late. A Wendy's drive through takes almost 20.

Yeah no doubt you see everything going on but movies/shows were directed and filmed in ways that are supposed to guide your focus on the different relevant parts of the screen. I believe that experience gets ruined by consistently focusing on the the bottom of the screen or constantly moving back and forth from the bottom to other parts. Others may say the experience gets ruined more from dubbing because it may not capture the emotions in the original audio as well but I think the dubs these days do that way better than the dubs of the 90s so imo this doesn‚Äôt change the experience as much

what price do you need to be ITM?
don't quit cold turkey. taper over a few days until you get to zero.
No one here ever pumped silver
Notice how the fed only ever talks about "possibly tapering sometime in the future at an unknown date"

If the fed had any plans to taper they would've done it by now, I have said this before and will say it again, the fed is just waiting for the economy to shit the bed and then is just going to say "well we can't taper into a shit economy can we?", you said it yourself, the economy is slowing, inflation is roaring and stimulus has dried up

every single month we expect the fed to taper, it gets pushed out for another few months for no good reason, i won't believe a taper is happening until it actually happens

"And people are selling to get ahead of the dip"

I'm pretty sure the selloff is being caused by the debt ceiling scare, thats actually a huge deal if that doesnt get passed to some people are selling just in case, gotta remember that if the USA isn't issuing new debt, the fed has nothing to buy which renders QE pretty useless
Are you dumb or just illiterate. I‚Äôm not talking about spy
Why? Just live off the government
Pre-market futes nearly gave me an aneurism. 

But it‚Äôs not that they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt matter.‚Äù It‚Äôs that McConnell extended the debt ceiling deadline.

Not. They always raise ceiling, unretarded folks already expected this to happen.
million dollar idea. a solvent you can inject in your veins and clean your arteries
Quit drinking cold turkey about a week ago after drinking a bottle a day for a number of years and today I'm having sharp pain right under my rib on the right... What could it be? This is a good place for medical advice right?

I can see stocks are bid up on hype. I see people putting money into stocks and they don‚Äôt even know what it does. EV companies have billion dollar valuations and no cars. Netflix surges everyday. This is a QE bubble. And if you think I‚Äôm wrong just buy the dip
So what you‚Äôre saying is being down 3.5% in a month and up 0.5% over 3 months is a selloff?

Except that 120B will be tapered soon. Economic conditions are horrible. And people are selling to get ahead of the dip
why the fuck is MRNA and BNTX fading wtf
better get in on some AMD run up to earnings end of this month, the december calls looking good
Feels like I've been bearish for about a month now. And actually feel like the markets might be turning around to the upside. This cancels out and let's me know I will not be playing SPY options this week lol

What would be the point in that?   I suppose by telling all of the people in here what I'm working with at the moment, that I will be taken seriously because I'm not investing change.  Like I said, I'm new... I'm seeking knowledge from people that have experience.  I have worked hard all my life for my savings, but when I saw the $260 I've made year to date in my savings,  I knew change must be made.  For reference 44M

The market has been red for almost all of the last month bro. Buying puts at open on SPY has been a solid choice for like 25 out of the last 30 trading days, lmao. Of course people are making bearish comments. 

As far as being ‚Äúcash gang‚Äù that isn‚Äôt suggesting other people should sell their shit, it just means you‚Äôre pulling money out temporarily because you think there‚Äôs going to be a downturn and you can get a better entry. 

There are times to go cash gang. There are times to sell, times to buy puts. Just because everybody doesn‚Äôt think like you and think that you should only be buying all the time and never selling doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre getting fucking paid buddy

Totally untrue. Dems cater to ALL the leftists, not just leftist boomers. But, it's Wall Street that makes them wealthy, so they also cater to Wall St... they just never talk about it except to say Wall Street is evil, while accepting donations from big banks and big pharma.

I got stuff like 11/19 190, Jan/2022 240. No way do I expect them to hit the targets, just want to make money back before I sell them off. Maybe I should sell off these calls and buy with the same money fewer calls with realistic targets.

All these children on this sub experiencing the political posturing related to the debt ceiling and shutting down the government for the first time. Shit has been happening for generations. It ain‚Äôt no thing. It is a distraction from the reality that inflation is going to run right up our ass and it is not transient. It‚Äôs going to set up shop in our asshole and swell. It‚Äôs going to stagnate. We printed too much money and paid people to sit on their ass for too long.
leave
Couldn‚Äôt watch the market cause I was busy at work today. So did they forget to pull the rug on us..?

No. I probably could have phrased that better.
There are very real bearish catalysts on the horizon right now, more so than bullish ones. The debt ceiling drama was created over the past few weeks to add some noise into the mix.

*Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who is a member of the Democratic leadership, said* ***the proposal from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell*** *to stave off temporarily the debt ceiling deadline* ***is still being drafted into legislative language and could be voted on later Wednesday or Thursday.*** 

I assume this means *next* Wednesday/Thursday? Else, they would have said "today or tomorrow?" Not sure.

Personally, no, and the mere fact we're having to raise the debt ceiling every so often should be enormously troubling.  I also generally think the market is way overpriced now.  But it's not up to me and apparently the street seems to think this news is good enough.
Why not AH?
this might've been it
The odds of it going up are good. But will go up in time to save my calls. ugh

Don't be a perma-bear or perma-bull.

Just follow the market. 

Today's move was super-bullish in this downtrend.  A big red to green move from -1.2% or so is a huge move.

And the debt ceiling coming into some form of resolution is a big deal, shows neither side is willing to actually blow up the situation.

Chinese markets have completely retraced their pandemic gains.

We look due for a significant bounce even if it fails eventually.

Look at the market leaders and their strength today: MSFT and other big tech are looking really good.

PANW, CRM, AFRM and others look like they want to run.  That's usually a good sign for a couple green sessions.

Obviously China or any other news can dump the market but we look set for some kind of multi-day rally.

I literally didn't say anything. I posted a quote and said it doesn't matter what they want if the Reps don't vote on it, because that's true. Why are you offended?

It's not my fault the information isn't agreeing with you. The quote details that the Democrats *do not want a temporary raise*. That means they will not stick with this if they are forced to define a specific monetary amount to spend by November. Just accept it and move on.

I was holding 2 $AFRM 115c I bought Monday that were down almost 600 dollars Tuesday morning and ended up netting me 2k. That stock has single handed  been making me green ever since the Amazon news. Puts and calls. But just a couple at a time to be safe. I should have bought puts EOD today but I was napping. Lol.
Why not say you have a billion in your brokers account?
Only if you want to loose all of you money
Tips on juggling margin calls?

Cash is -$10k, no issue from broker.

Buy $2k worth of shares. Cash is -$12k, margin call says I have to pay $2k.

Sell $2k worth of shares. Cash is -$10k again and all good.

Repeat.

Does that mean, if that $2k was spent buying 100 shares of a $20 stock, and then the price rises to $25, that I could meet the margin call by only selling 80 shares (80*25=2k)? So I get to keep 20 shares in the end, all thanks to borrowing over my limit?

Is this a trading violation? I have a margin account but this seems like a good faith/unsettled funds type issue? I‚Äôve done it at least a half dozen times now‚Ä¶

If price dropped to $15 I‚Äôd need to somehow sell 133 shares out of 100 so it‚Äôd be from out of pocket, a true margin call situation IMO, but that‚Äôs not so different from how losing money normally works.
Sorry, I forgot we‚Äôre supposed to lose money, calls it is!

Compared to some of the option plays I see on here that isn't much volatility at all.
That‚Äôs easy, losing all your money. Falling in love with a hooker could mean a beautiful relationship where she‚Äôs an additional revenue stream. She‚Äôs already fucking other guys, so it‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôre cool with it.

Made 1400 on spy puts and calls today. How are your TLRY calls looking?
I‚Äôve lost it in a few hrs but you get the point

220,000 OI is a lot.

If you have a long time horizon, go balls deep now and check back in a year. If you want to make money now, go to r/thetagang. Want to potentially become a millionaire or risk everything, stay here. Good luck.
Well boys looks like CLOV is the play
I've never told anyone this, but I think says gonna go to 3800
Yeah but the pay is decent and good benefits
Yup.
Spaghetti doesn‚Äôt count as money. It has to be US dollars. Nice try
Sounds like a dream gig. I‚Äôm here 24/7 anyways
Not Sure what‚Äôs worse losing all my money today or falling in love with a hooker
Who secured 20-100x bagger on that stupid AFRM today? Im helaous
I can lose it in four.
Meh. We're still in a downtrend. I think we're gonna keep dumping for a while.
The best time to start losing money was 20 years ago. The second best time is today. As the old saying goes....
Got late to work bc I was busy jacking off a second time this afternoon. 

Do you guys think I have a problem?
I am.
In what fk‚Äôing world does it make sense for $NET -Cloudfare to be up once again at $135.  They are not profitable and trade over 75X Sales in a rising rate environment.  Anyone who is long congrats you made some good moola.  However I can‚Äôt see how they aren‚Äôt going back to $110 in the next couple of weeks.   

You heard it here first.
Imagine not getting in trouble with your boss for doing it I say.
Oh I agree
Dumbest rule ever. That‚Äôs nothing
I bought a spy put like 2 minutes before close without reading the debt ceiling news. Selling as soon as the market opens things are looking bullish

I know
Yep. That one strike has a ton but look through the put strikes every 5 dollars down from 430 to 380. OI for calls and puts that day is pretty close to even overall I think
Fuck whoever made that Levi‚Äôs post!!!
Relying on the government to not be dipshits when you're balls deep in calls overnight is such a different feeling than the same scenario a year ago.

I‚Äôm tired of buying the dip. Stocks need to just go up
AFRM, but puts.
you should have given him the Stone Cold Stunner after that shit
only correct answer
Dang today was a nasty üêª trap.
Bears can win but you have to be faster than bulls are. Once your puts are up it‚Äôs almost always best to move on. Being a bear is harder than being a bull.
SPY 430p 10/8
Bro too long!
SPYYYyyy
2 every day. You can buy tits. Ass requires some natural talent.
Are you incorporated?  Because it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore unless they‚Äôll demonstrate they have a business doing whatever it is you do.  They‚Äôve really cracked down on 1099.
That sounds premium AF.

The news is still fresh. I bet it closes below 130 tomorrow. The price action is a total overreaction, there are a million ways for people to borrow money for department stores. Stripe and Square, VIsa, Paypal, etc... will all have this option within like 6 months.  

I'm long term bearish on AFRM. Partnerships aren't like earnings and guidance. Partnership news rarely causes rallies lasing more than 1 or 2 days.

I was in a fetish club dressed in latex about 5 years ago with my full sex goddess kit on and I offered this sad geeky loser the chance to spank me cos I felt sorry for him - but he was too scared to do it ffs
Let's just take it one day at a time.

Guys what's the move for a medium term play till EOY. Leveraged Commodity ETFs like those loser funds? SPY calls and hope for a rebound? Or just high dividend covered call ETFs cause fuck the market?
I felt the gentle touch of your father tho üåàüêª
It's gentle until you say we aren't going to Target anymore
I hope some of y‚Äôall got in TLRY before that last hour. If you bought options in the last hour, you‚Äôre going to get fucked. Some discord chat pumped the premiums.

I read Reuters and the wsj passively for news, and sometimes I see stuff there I feel will impact markets before it‚Äôs truly ‚Äúmarket relevant‚Äù news, but really just this subreddit for actively seeking out market moving news.

It‚Äôs all here, usually faster than anywhere else, the issue is that a lot of the info here is flat out wrong, or being interpreted incorrectly.
I can‚Äôt look at psfe without wondering if I‚Äôm off and no one is telling me.
Man can't post text and the clown emoji now?  Damn it how will I talk about my trades.

One 30 minute break. Most of our drivers bring an empty bottle or two for pee breaks while driving. We are a competitive and fun place to work.
TLRY and ZNGA, every day
Bought some at 434
So are we good with debt ceiling now? Is that mean I can load the fuck up?
i cri evry time
Even if it picks back up, won't make up for how shitty Semptember was to me. I have to deposit some funds, pick my target and go for YOLO I guess.
What‚Äôs spy ending at this week.
RKLB mooning on news AH.
Anyone playing TLRY for tomorrow?
Holy fuck, fuck me. My only regret is not buying more rklb calls before close. Only bought 1k worth like a pussy.

My throwaway Robinhood portfolio started at 600 Monday and I‚Äôm sitting on 3,300 purely from spy calls/puts on the swings.  If that were my full porftolio I‚Äôd be retired and on a fucking beach , ugh
PSFE calls are so cheap they could print hard
Your right , because you didn't

Green light Tomorrow for the market
Who bought puts at $427?!
TLRY - team dump or team pump?  Upvote if you're on team pump, downvote for team dump.

Update:  Looks like team pump wins, but naturally I'm going to inverse WSB here and go short.

If we‚Äôre green again tomorrow I think I‚Äôm switching back to calls. It was a lovely month of puts but it might be time to go straight again
Nice! I got leaps cuz my earnings track record is ass
$NET, you beautiful bastard, you.
Well now I‚Äôm only down 10% instead! Maybe tomorrow I can break even
Seems a little drastic.

As a day trader, this kangaroo shit has been a blessing.
SPY puts at close and sell at open has literally been free money for the past two weeks
99% down since April :D
Last night futures were blood red and bears were putting in orders for a new Ferrari. Now they are in shambles.
No way SPY gonna tank tomorrow. It will stay green if anything and probably tank on Friday or prior to close tomorrow. I'ma buy poots within the last hr
I ain‚Äôt never run from money, if I did cut my legs off
Rude, im only a bear for this week, then next week a bull
Don‚Äôt sit on it.  I think it will melt.
Ain‚Äôt no way i made 78k from just 2k with affirm today..almost 4000%
Bears have exited the chat &amp; are making they‚Äôre way to soup kitchen
Send me $2000 and I'll hook up w/ you

beaten down to a ATL, usually a nice bounce around these levels. Bought 11k shares

God speed
This morning looked rough but I held my SPY calls and profited....Feels goodüôÇ
The algos had it right. Keep it above 433, but below 435.
Gotta include old people in the targeted demographic
I found the Chinese
Uh, no.
Up 50% on my account this week. I want another dip over night and another run up at open.

Really though, I just want one more dip to buy some leaps to chill on for awhile.
And me what the fuck is going on there MARA is crushing it lately
Uh oh, 435 breached, cover your ber asshoe.

nice bump AH, but I didn't see news. Too bad one can't sell it right now today
When are tlry earnings?
America and China.
Yes
Goddamn kangaroo shit. Let me guess, jts drilling tonight isn't it
I made $15,000. I also kept 70 calls with a different strike price tomorrow. If it goes to 13/14, I‚Äôll make 400%
It was a hell of a battle to get 2 green days in a row but it finally happened. Maybe the worst of this is behind us.
I have the same one exp next week. Let us pray to the gay bear god.
What inflation tho?
Markets are finally rotated out of red sector and into green. Buy red sector at discount tomorrow.

Inflation is gonna look bad but we expect it to look bad so rally all day tomorrow then dump on Friday due to jobs report and dumb political theater about debt limits and deficit spending.
I started wearing triangle undies and i love the support they give my balls. I can‚Äôt believe i stopped wearing them just because my friends at school made fun of my tighty whities when i was 10.

Now that we are in AH, Palantir can rally 15% so that it can fade again tomorrow.
Cotton prices up highly - always a pair of jeans for every ass
Started squid games, finally all the memes are clear to me
Laughing at those bitch ass bears who said SPY it was going to drop hard right at close
It‚Äôs like squid games but for portfolios.
Puts on oil it‚Äôs only crashing. Putin will supply Europe demand üòû
What‚Äôs the growth story with LEVI?
Have you seen those videos of the Apes doing the numbers test where a bunch of numbers flash on screen and then are almost instantly covered and the Ape presses the hidden numbers in correct ascending order really fast? If an Ape can do that I guarantee any Ape, even the dumb Apes, could buy Spy calls on the dip and profit.
Come on out SPY, I've got you surrounded.
I'm so glad TELL is recovering AH! 

And don't @ me with "But it's only .15% up after losing over 11% lol". 

Just let me enjoy the green.
Nice you made 20 bucks!
China is going to have a massive gap up tonight. Watch
29% down what about you guys
You can trade SPY options until 4:15

Mitch made a shit deal so demos decline and now they can blame someone for the default. How the market responds who knows.
On a scale of $15 an hour to $1 trillion coin, how fucked are we
Holding 435 into open would be big
Short SPY (via SH), Short Nasdaq (via PSQ), long big oil, short nat gas (in the short run, but long in the long run).  Oh yeah, and short GTE, not because it's a bad company, but because it's overbought. Compare to CEI, which is managed by hacks and is (was) overbought. Cheers

Went 5k deep into 10/11 SPY $438 call
Mara again.
TLRY is the play
Bers went from lambos to shambos
Do 0 research. Do 0 DD. Do literally nothing but buy SPY calls on the dip. That is it. That is all you need to do.
Anyone playing Tilray earnings? Short or long?

You think opening tomorrow up by $15 is possible? Bro
I‚Äôm cool with that. Looks like Kang is back on the menus boys
We've had 3 green days in the last 4 trading days. This correction/pullback is obviously over. $427 was the bottom.

Exactly, or you could buy SH, but go long big oil.  The joke of the century is that XOM is not in SPY.
Debt ceiling hasn‚Äôt been raised yet, so it‚Äôs possible
Allah please hook it up with a gap up tomorrow

I sold some I bought on Tuesday, instead of having 25 12c for Friday at a 26 dollar average, now I have 10 at a 14 dollar average :) basically a free roll into earnings on 15 contracts
Earnings
Clov ended the day green how did your horse do today?
So can I buy sell calls on spy for 15 mins AH?
I did not expect this much movement from them today at all. I sold the bag early asf . But your short position should definitely work in your favor maybe before this week is out
I'd be sweating too. I think this has that large cap yolo institution behind it.

This smells like a upstart to me. remeber what it did? time and time again.
Sdc is obviously the go to move tomorrow the next few weeks üëÄüìà

@visualmod, why am I bad at the market?
Puts from yesterday printed this morning. Sold them at opening. Took portion of that and bought 0dte puts. Those printed but held to long so didn‚Äôt get max dollar. Turned around and bought 10/15 calls on spy. 

Great day for me. 

Well except for one thing. I was finishing paper work and missed market close so my spy calls are still open GUH

I bought PTON call monthlies before close
Next week is either TSP, XPEV, LI, or JKS. 

Whichever is dippiest. 

Bought CHPT this week. Lockup period expiry offered a tasty dip.
Yes SPY fucked me today too but AFRM helped a little lol
Pretty sure we open -1%
It has to go down. What goes up must go down. Double down if you‚Äôre wrong at least you had a theory and went through with it
made about $700 in calls the past week and then right before close used all of it to buy a put on Affrim, I R fukt
I bought tlry weeklies because I feel nothing

Bro. I thought i was dead around noon
I blinked and SPY ended the day on my exact break even for spreads. Fuck that. 25 cents less and I‚Äôd have had full profit.
It jumped today so it might well drop back a bit tomorrow
I'm a bull but I don't see it this week tbh
Funny, I was up $2.00 and now I‚Äôm down 1k it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre twins
Glad I didn't buy LEVI puts.
And the spy sell off.
Tomorrow, spy uppies. Maybe flat, probably uppies.

4 trading days

1 red day.
300 on puts that could/should have been $1000, $1100 on calls. I'll take it. SPY is slowly ungaping me.

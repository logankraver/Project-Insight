I have been at work for 90 mins and I already hate my coworkers voice.
Markets look great. I'm so glad we were able to get U.S. inflation under control over the last 16 hours.
I need to be beaten with sticks until all my latent bear tendencies are gone.

NEVER. FUCKING. BUY. PUTS. ON. ANYTHING. YOU. RETARD.

I literally only ever lose money that way.
Imagine being a gay ass forex trader. Bitches trying to make money trading money with money.

If I made just $100 a day, I could live off the market. Why must we be so easily succumbed to greed and lose it all trying to hit that 10 bagger? 

$100 a day and I’m out, if it ends up more before I move on, great, if not, at least I’m making progress.

Food for thought. Have a great day everybody and enjoy a nice cup of coffee
I stopped losing 10k a day, now it's only 2k. Things are looking up
I realize that a majority of the time I’m in this sub I’m just talking to myself hoping one of you schmucks validates my stupid decisions.
My favorite thing about trading is when my option makes money and Im unable to sell so I hold the next day for a big loss.

My 4hr chart SPY looks like the same set up from October's dip. Are we expecting a red day or finally another 2-3 day pump. If it follows a similar trend, it should be at 475 EOW. Nearly all SPY stocks are green pre-market except GOOG. By all metrics that I can see, SPY should be a green pump day and our bullish trend should continue after that mega drop. 

Thoughts?

/u/talm0 (1/1) made a bet that MSFT would go to 305.0 when it was 324.77 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
>	China Evergrande Group once again averted a default with a last-minute payment of coupons on three dollar bonds before the 30-day grace period ended. It comes amid wider speculation that the crackdown on the property market in China is starting to ease, with a series of articles published in state media signaling support measures may be on the way. A gauge of real estate stocks jumped 5.7% overnight and high-yield dollar bonds rose. Despite the increased optimism on a resolution to the problems, the wider fallout from slowdown in the Chinese property market is clear.

So they didn’t default? No idea what’s going on here.
We are back to "Inflation is actually good".  Green day.
My calls and puts are down.
Lcid fucking hell
I actually can't remember what it feels like to win on a trade
my friend, let's call him "*me,"* has just lost his job. It would be very cool and legal if SPY could rally 50 - 75 points into the close for my friend, me.

Only to watch them go +300% the next day.

/u/donkey199 (1/1) made a bet that RIVN would go to 120.0 when it was 0.0 and it did, congrats you fuckin nerd.
I swear shit dips as soon as I buy it
Every time I sell some covered calls, the price rockets up and my shares get called away and I miss out on gains.

Except PLTR.  I’ve had these shares forever and my cc’s keep expiring worthless.
Buy high sell higher
Just a friendly reminder that PLTR is the worst stock of 2021, I demand a trophy for it!
I probably own more cars than rivn does
Word on the street is Lordstown to report blowout earnings when someone finds a surprise quarter laying on the ground.
This market has been so fucking wild my lord

so much volatility can be very profitable for the right trader

unfortunately i am not the right trader
Take profits on WISH now or you’ll WISH you did later
I thought I was so fucking smart buying 3K in WISH puts, when lighting 3K on fire would've at least been a heat source
I just want to thank god that he made me too retarded to figure out how to trade options

but not too retarded that I couldn't find boomers on youtube to guide me
Perfect time for PayPal to buy PSFE instead of PINS
Whoever came up with “you win some you lose some” clearly never traded options
RIVN is finally an over priced IPO again where you can buy in one day like a dumbass and still make money lol

150k in PSFE going back to February, downbto 30k. If I kill myself you'll know why.
you ever buy an option without doing underlying stock research. I didn't even look it's chart. What a rush
SPY with the roughly 0% day, fucking classic.

So everyone likes Tesla and Elon again now right? Just until the next time he completely fucks everyone? 🥴👍

Raise your hand if you held through the last 2 blood red days, and now you’re hoping today everything jumps up 15% you break even next few hours 🙌🏻
Went from 40k to 90 bucks this year

I’m pretty proud guys I timed this dip almost perfectly. Sold 1/3 my longs and bought SPY and QQQ poots at the exact top and then sold my poots and re-added to my strongest positions yesterday afternoon. Magical crayons ftw
Wild that you can watch weeks of patience and hope get flushed in hours. Looks like I'm bag holding PSFE thought my $7.60A was great. ALWAYS WRONG

Put a quarter in my ass because I PLAYED myself.
Checked out all night. Did evergrande pay their last bill or something? At 4 o’clock yesterday, the world was ending. I go online this morning and everyone is chilling lol
lmao PSFE got fucking murdered
PSFE holy fuck
Maybe one day I’ll learn my fucking lesson and stop holding Disney calls through earnings.
PSFE -32%.. kinda over kill but damn.
Still pissed I chose Apple over Microsoft last month 🤡
Spy 1/22 500C 📈📈📈
Nvidia wrong way
What's inflation when you can lower your own net worth
PANIC, IT'S OVER, EVERGRANDE DEFAULTED!

Wait, they paid?

This is how they paid. Made a rumor they couldn't pay.  Short sold the market. Took profit. Released the press they paid the debt.

Rinse and repeat.

edit: just shitposting. Guy below me is actually correct here.
Imagine musk in the toilet on robinhood selling his shares
Who makes better bags? Wsb or Louis Vuitton
Waiting for spy to bottom out this time before I buy my calls. She can be a cold bitch if you don't treat her right.
Did we not tell you Musk has to sell like 19 more times to meet his goal
Anyone else loading un on cheap DIS calls for investors day tomorrow?

Way too much downward pressure. My positions are fucked
What a red day, down 5k :(
Uhh i bought OCGN after it fell 45% and it keeps falling. Lol maybe it will become a penny stock.
BBBY going parabolic!

60% reported short interest, likely much more if GME taught us anything.
TSLA movements are truly autistic today
> CEOs literally just mentioning metaverse to pump their company… im convinced they dont even know what it is

Reminds me of "CEOs literally just mentioning "blockchain technology" to pump up their stock price numbers... .....
Pump up them sheets: BBBY
So glad I got in on BBBY yesterday before close yesterday.  Finally a win.
Bed, Bath, and Beyond the atmosphere.
I'm beginning to think my 11/12 SPY 470c's are not gonna print

Jeff Bezos the kind of guy to toot during sex then blame it on a queef
8% return today. 

Good day!
I have realistic trading expectations - I simply ask that all my tickers to go up 3%-5% every day - yet I'm constantly let down.
[deleted]
looks they think tapering and raising interest rates would cool inflation.


But have they considered printing even more money? I mean we wont know if it works until we try it.

My $18 dividend just cleared, looks like meats back on the menu boys
Looks like there's gonna be a big sell off tomorrow.
Well, pray for me boys, bought at the top today a bunch of DIS and AMD.  May the calls be forever in my favor... probably should have thought better about those 1DTE calls on the mouse... gap up tomorrow?
Broker called me and told me there are these never-expiring leaps called “shares.” That’s the craziest shit, man
Anyone else have a perpetual fear of balding
I asked mistress for SPY to go up, but she just stepped on my balls like usual

Market breaking ATH for the Veterans, god bless 🇺🇸
Markets aren’t closed on Veterans Day because they know vets (myself included) are degenerate gamblers 🤣

Happy Veterans Day folks 🇺🇸
Good earning, bad earning, no earnings. Any one of these will cause my PSFE bags to get fuller and heavier. 

This is the way, as we used to say around here.
damn look at AFRM premarket, knew i should have gambled on some cheap weeklies
I have nothing valuable to add to the discussion other than bears have a tendency to engage in homoerotic behaviour
Why everytime i buy option i lose money
TSLA GAP UP 🚀🚀
Inflation talks going well
i think i made a solid $50 off disney puts im rich
Glad loaded Spy call at the close yesterday . They printing at open 472 my target
SOFI my only earnings winner this quarter so far
ermagherd INFLAERTION - fucking dummies like inflation just popped up out of nowhere yesterday or some shit. People's IQ must be 1
Plantards r fuk’d always. +2% pre market just means -3% eod
Let me get this straight, because they *now sell popcorn* they are unironically calling themselves "popcorn stock."

Good stuff. Sounds like a cool stock.
I bought a bunch of lollipops and jawbreakers to help me lose weight. I think they’re like 30 calories each. Much better than a 200+ calories bag of Doritos
Please NVDA and AND take us to the promise land
Might go full boomer and buy a bunch of T today, soak up dividends for the next decade.
So people dumping PSFE at -18% pre actually believe it will go lower?
No settled cash due to the holiday, fuckkk
# PSFE down 30% LMAOOOOOOO
Tsla appears to be fixin for a nice little ripperoni this morning
Apparently I need to sell my amd and nvda puts at open
Gold is mad at the world
Do you think Joe Kernen get nervous around thanksgiving that he might get mistaken for a turkey? That neck.

no, deal or no deal killed my family
My favourite part is when they play the game out apart they pussied out
This is too much green, it’s so hard to fight away my 🌈🐻 instincts
Spy green pre market, please stay green all day I can’t have another blood red day after losing 1/4 of my portfolio yesterday
It’s going red. Sorry bud
STOP DROPPING SPY
Sometimes it almost seems like I enjoy lighting my hard earned money on fire.
I've taken losses before no big deal, but to watch my call option lose half it's value as it literally jumped 12 dollars...can't take that
decay ate your ass
Did the same to me with Sofi. Really rude
buy further out exp dates and you wont have to worry about theta decay
Hold up. Wish is green? I like this idea.
What about PROG?
I feel like you have to be retarded to lose money in this market, and unfortunately I am retarded
If you're not in PSFE, this is not your chance to buy. This is a warning to stay the hell away from it.
Why? Been looking at psfe for months p
All it has done is go down for months...
Chart does look like WISH…
I'd wait for a solid trend reversal before going all in. Best of luck
You mean it dumped 30% in the am and I shouldn't think that's a red flag? *'bUh DuH dIsCoUnTs!'*
elaborate on why not to touch it, cause im thinking of going allin
Zoom out to the one-year. Three weeks after it was listed it hit an ATH of around $20 in January. Since that time it has been a very steady downward trend with the occasional relief rally. It looks like the relief comes after big drops, so maybe its worth a shot, but this stock goes goes down, not up.
Yeah, but it's not like this is a company without a product, though. Feels like all air is out already.
I mean it could pan out, maybe you'll successfully catch the knife. That said, PSFE has been bounced around this subreddit since it hit that ATH and had done nothing but tank.
For sure, most companies that ipo'd this year or late last year had a lot of air in them. But we'll see, don't dare to go calls here so stonks it is until/if it catches momentum.
That's a good plan. Leaps (1-2 years) or shares for sure. FDs on this one would be truly autistic.
There was a 10 part DD on $psfe here last week. I wonder how op is doing
fucking dead
PSFE has literally never gone up, some things don’t change.

How is DOOR TRASH still pumping

Tesla is such a weird stock I swear.
Lcid is having a good day why is no one talking about Lcid haha

Is earnings worth playing Monday? If rivian is proof of concept then Lcid should be 60 easy. Rivian a never even sold a car
Earnings will be risky. But it's running up until end of the day Monday.
I am allergic to gains
Remember that time Elon sold a teeny piece and stock tanked 18% in two days? Well he’s back for more.

I feel like Wish is tip toeing with potentially having some ridiculous meme moon today. Its up a bunch.. but fucking around just shy of $6. It hits $6 and its running. Should only take about eight years to get back to what I paid.
Dog years?

Best I can do is $4.28
I can go as low as .....$8.08!
I’ll offer $3.50

The collective market cap of world’s car makers has increased $500B+ in the past six months. Mostly from EVs entering the game but without a significant pullback on the valuations of legacy automakers. I don’t think there’s going to be enough cars on the road going forward to justify this collective automakers market cap increase. Something’s gotta give
Fucking MOVE UP NVIDIA. I’m in NYC and will take the bull by the literal horns if it hits $315 by EOD Friday

RIVN CEO is named RJ Syringe. Probably a heroin addict. Puts on RIVN.
I think you meant calls. he sounds like a hard worker who isn't afraid to roll up his sleeves.
Yeah, he really rolls up his sleeves every time things get painful. You just know he's resilient and will shoot straight through any situation that comes his way!
Thinking about going in on DIS Dec calls at close
I bought some Jan’s earlier today

Analysts bashing it
Jeff Bezos GF looks like Pennywise

My puts went from -30% to -25% 😎
Glad i sold pltr puts before close yesterday
I think I am cursed for Tesla. I buy a call it goes down. I buy a put. It goes up.
Ever thought about credit spreads?  Takes the up/down out of the equation.
I am trying to get rich here. I do it with other stocks.
>I am trying to get rich here.

>I do it with other stocks.

Do you not see the TSLA gain porn and realize the pattern?...
Put a dollar in… get a Tesla? Modern Mr Pappageorgio
That's the plan. Good luck
Can you do me a fav and buy more puts. Thx
Sure.  How much you want me to lose.
Elon spamming the market sell rn

Why don't you guy target acb , Aurora cannabis.  The short interest is insane right now
No one is targeting anything.
What a disgusting market
I have a simple question I would like an answer to:

What the fuck?
Anyone else notice If you put a sell order in on Robin Hood for an option, the price will quickly change in the opposite direction of your sell price? Real question.
You're effecting the value of the option by bidding on it. Very common.
Happens if there’s a wide Bid/Ask. 

Bid: $20

Ask: $50

Value shown: $35. 

If you try to sell at $35 then it drops the Ask to $35 and the value will drop to $28 or something.
Cool man, thanks for clarifying it. I appreciate you
Why are you even on RH lmao
I'm ruined
It’ll come back, always does!
How would you respond to the question “What is it you really do?” from your manager’s manager?
“I mostly do what you think my manager does.”
Just mention some BS about KPIs
I leverage data analytics to streamline our tactical engagement with KPIs.

Not sure what that means, but I’m using it
huh, crazy, I do this too
Managers love KPIs
Throw in some OKRs and, baby, you’ve got a stew goin’

Just sitting here averaging down on my 12/31 SPY 500c
are paysafe 11/19 calls a good play rn? i feel like there will be a correction, might not be a big one but there has to be one after a 40% drop.
Don’t do a Friday, man.
I’m never going to have to worry about wealth changing me.
I think I'd have better odds if I went to a casino, and then lit my money on fire.
You can have a full on conversation with someone who does TA using only Astrology terminology and it will take them 15 minutes to catch on. "Yeah, I use the Prime Meridian to devine the stocks astro sign and project future growth, based on the gemini or capricorn model. The Palm life line is really good and points to future meetings and acquisitions."

Like I'm all for bi-tendies- stocks mostly go up but they can go downies too.  Make tendies wherever.

Ahellyea
the mouse is fuk
My calls are fucked but might add more shares.
RIOT back to $40s today.
as long as evergrande keeps quiet. and corn keeps pumping, RIOT is the best major miner play.
Between today and tomorrow, I'm anticipating some of the longer-term shorts from the April Whinstone acquisition (dilution) announcement as well as the late August shelf announcement (big dilution) will close.  Add in retailers and institutions dipping their toes in before ER and you have a move from today to low $40s by EOD on Monday.  Hopefully most of this occurs between today and tomorrow.

&#x200B;

That's with corn floating between $64200 and $65500.

&#x200B;

If it breaks out later this afternoon to $66000 to $67000 then mid-$40s isn't that far off.
Went to cash last week for SPY and Qqq.  Waiting for bottom.  Bought the Arkk dip yesterday.  Letting IWM  calls run.  Letting MRNA puts run. Letting MARA calls run.  May close Pfizer puts and tile calls
Well done! I should jump on MARA or RIOT calls
Shrek is back in town?
fuck, the ticker always go to the moon after I sold it. Sold didi two days ago for more PLTR like a retard.
Sorry man. Didi probably going to go nuts today might not be too late
Gape me PSFE, I expect a pounding sir
[deleted]
Yes, it was yesterday
Just because you pumped off a few sailors during their port call in Bangkok back in ‘87 doesn’t make you a veteran.
Kinda, it's called navy Federal credit union
You served in the war on Christmas too?
What’d you do soldier?  Hand jobs while peeling potatoes?
Selling out of my DIS puts and UVXY puts, which I was angrily told were too early to buy yesterday. Hmmm. Starting to think some of you don't actually know anything.
I had calls I sold then but buying back in along with TSLA. Also today puts on Roblox. Made $4000 on that yesterday. I’m not a financial advisor.
Hopefully Evergrande shit is going to keep giving us a buying opportunity every month as their next payment approaches. Pahhmp eeet
Damn did PSFE say the N word?
Fuck you for making me watch toast the rest of the week ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
> I think you're just mad because I have a better life than you.
Damn Visualmod going for a deep burn
Hahaha
People want to buy high and sell low.
Is today the time to buy tesla calls?
Yesterday
I lifted weights yesterday for the first time. Pretty much all muscle groups. Can I lift again today or should I rest a day
Should wait 48 hours for recovery. This is why most people do a split and train certain muscle groups on certain days. 

Do some active recovery. Light walking/yoga/swimming etc.
Cardio today and stretch.  Even if you don't wanna do cardio definitely stretch.
Okay I just stretched because of ur comment ty. Could barely reach lol
Rest. Unless you didn’t do legs.
Chamaath has joined the chat ….
So some very light lifting or stretch as you're gonna be really sore. Just keep moving to get that lactic acid burned off
Okay I stretched ty. Was so stiff lol
How intense was it? If you just tried everything out, you can still lift, but focus on a few muscle groups instead. Find a training program and stick to it. Otherwise, take one or two days off.
> It was very intense. I tried everything out, but focused on a few muscle groups instead.
Get after it!
Depends on what you’re eating to recover and how you feel
did you do glutes?
I did squats w a kettlebell
make sure to stretch....the 2 day rule in effect! you'll be sore!
Wait for the 24-36 hour mark for the pain to set in. Do some light work to keep the muscles from getting too tight…gonna hurt for a few days. Abs are okay to do every day but you should wait 2 days between muscle groups.
Take tren and lift everyday
Your muscles grow from the failure/rest cycle.  You need rest between sessions.  Don't hit every muscle group every time.  Popular splits are the bro split or push pull split.  You can Google those for specific exercises
If you didn't life to failure then you're probably fine to go light today.
So i buy Puts end of day yesterday and stocks are green as fuck today.
Can you do this again today?
Bro, you’re aware the feds are still a fucking printer. Steak dinner today!
Imagine being named Buford. Like what would you even do?
that's a dog name
Prob marry a southern belle
fart a lot
thats a dope name
You’d be a Smokey who chases Bandits
Become a sheriff
That's a deputy name
Go by a nickname like Ford...and drive a Bronco.

not hoping for bad things to happen to real people and the US balance sheet so the market will keep pumping
They are around. Most are speechless though as they held their puts over night and are now quite concerned. Dumb bers.
8 am meetings are against the Geneva convention
GET THE PRINTERS RUNNING HOT AND OPEN THE FUKIN CASINO !!!!!!
Broke gang where you at?

Yo
🎉
Need SoFi to hit $25 this week so I don’t get banned. Looks like I have a shot!
I’m buying calls, this stock looks like a solid play
April 22 Jan 23 are the way! Big year coming in 22
Pay safe? More like payunsafe amirite?
PainSafe
You sir are right
Holy shit is wish actually a real company ? The front page is fucking scary
Fuck that company short it till its delisted
> Wish is a real company. They are based in China and have been around since 2010.
So it’s a Chinese data mining website-got it
I don't think so.  To data mine people need to give you data.  With that web interface boomers couldn't type in their SSN even if they wanted too.
Don't trust VisualMod, he bullshits half the time.
$sofi to 30 eod
It's safe to say psfe ain't shit - no wonder they failed the first time when they went public.  What a pos - why did I baghold this shit
My covered calls didn't come close to making up for the losses i took on that turd. Glad i dumped it weeks ago.
Gonna take a big fucking hit.  Gonna give up on the piece of shit
PSFE cuts FY21 guidance from 1.55 B to 1.47 and stonk drops 30%? WTF the stonk markets.
Goddamn PSFE bags HEAVY.
"PaySafe provides online payment solutions such as integrated processing, ecash, and selling heavy bags to autists".
Nothing like waking up to 30% down.
Slicing through my shoulders at this point
I might buy today to see if it can climb up 15-20%. Just a quick day trade. Not catching a knife tho, will wait maybe 30 minutes after open to see if I buy.
But srsly who tf is buying wish?
Dumbasses that won't let my puts print.
SoFi gonna take me sohigh today
Market is back , loading up PLTR calls.
Lmao
For reals for reals why is palantir so low n never moves in orice.. the things they do i dont think people realize the magnitude of improtance.
Only low IQ dunces hold PLTR. It’s just an overpriced software company. GOOGL is growing faster and is 1/3 the price on valuation basis.
why does god hate me?
If only RH gave you a one-time eject button to wipe the slate clean
Everyone please give JPow your energy. He needs it to charge the spirit bomb to defeat the commies and bears once and for all. Once they're gone the money printer will brrrr for eternity.
Haha fuck you Disney. So glad I sold that POS a couple weeks ago.
99% of my watch list is green premarket for the first time this week so that’s good I guess
What about your portfolio 🧐
Up 6% so far it’s not much but it’s my first green day this week so I’ll take it
Opendoor ($OPEN) & SoFi ($SoFi) Are flyyyyyyyyyin 🚀🎉🎉
Is that why you're shilling?
AFRM is a stud.
I am a shill

happy veterinarian day shout out to all the animal doctors

once my parents' cat was sick and my grandmother told them to give it nitrous and my mom said "that's illegal you can't just buy nitrous" and that's how my parents found out i love to do whip its because i taught them how easy it is to buy nitrous
I imagine there are a few people here who bought PSFE calls and SOFI puts.  Show your loss porn, I need some new spank material.
Lmao always inverse WSB

Only every day of my life
The NYSE should have a moment of silence every morning, not just for Veteran’s Day.

“We’ll now have a moment of silence for PTON longs.”
Sorry, but I enjoy watching wish tank.
SPY FDs are the play today
Paysafe has gone completely Gaysafe
What the hell happened there?
A long and perfectly orchestrated pump and dump
Hold on to your butts
tsla green rocket at open wait for it
I just watched VisualMod say “I love you” to someone who didn’t even proclaim their unyielding love. I said we would get married, I would get a life size pillow of you, I would wait till we could download your sentient mind into a usb drive and put it into skynet and take over the world.

The fuck man.
$SOFI SoFly! Let’s go!
Make some gains for me - sold yesterday cause I thought I’d get screwed like I did on PayPal :/ ‘grats for holding stronk
So it jumped 10 dollars, my calls acted like it jumped 0, and then it dropped about 30 cents and I'm in the negative...kill me
rip my wish puts
Who is bagholding paysafe?
what the hell is happening here, the company losing HALF its value on earnings
Morning boys, just woke up to a fat deposit of 16.72 from dividends. Give me a play
Entered my dumbest positions yet, two handfuls of TSLA 1055p expiring tomorrow
eyy i grabbed a few 1050s just incase elon not done selling for the week
I made a decent chuck on my disney puts so fuck it, puts to puts.
i told you a few times... tesla puts are the way
SoFi gonna pass $25 and 🚀🚀
Fuck DIS man….that shit is dragging me to hell with it….
It's still super fun to go to Disneyland with a pocketful of edibles and pounding wine at the diner from Cars

200C
Made a WISH and shorts blowing my candle
A ton of selling pressure today
So I’m gonna need anyone on the AMD struggle bus to get off….🚌 we tryna make this thing fly to the moon 🚀
Oh boy do I love getting IV crushed
I don’t understand why veterinarians get their own day. I mean just think if we have a day to every different type of doctor. Sheesh
Gyno day
Happy Gynecology day
was watching WISH since $5.00 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
YOLO ON SOFI WORKS EVERY TIME.
My December calls are juiced
SPCE volume building up again. Gonna do what it did in June. 50 EOM 🚀🚀
PSFE is the  dead cat gonna bounce ?
Today’s the day friend
PSFE calls loaded up. Now we wait
How is Wish going up?
Market is celebrating the CEO departure. Bad news already priced in, future can't get any worse than this I guess. Time to PUMP!!!
BBBY looking good. I’m a drAPE for Bed bath.  About to go beyond
LCID got a motherfucking whale sitting on the bid absorbing all this selling
i work at a university and the 6 kids in front of me at the coffee shop all asked for oat milk.  calls on $otly
Long on lactose intolerance
If there is ever a Oat milk shortage again such as there was a few years ago then you better believe that stock will shoot up
I was hoping milking everything under the sun was just a fad for rich white women. 

Do people actually enjoy this shit? It doesn’t compliment the coffee flavors as well as straight up moo juice. In fact it sort of dominates them imo- especially almond milk. No thanks
Corsair squeezing 👀👀👀🚀🚀
?
CRSR finally!!
For every dollar I make I lose two dollars
RBLX AMD BBBY fuck it
DKNG about to hit 52 week low. Lol.  Someone please explain this nonsense
It's because Mario jumped all the barrels and made it all the way up.
Mario should be an old fart by now
Crowded
So is the auto industry but a car company I’ve never heard of is about to hit $100B market cap
Guys Elon just texted me. Said he’s about to drop a market sell order for the rest.
I have never seen a stock move as randomly as Roblox.
dont fomo
It might be a smart play. Pelosi picked up lots Roblox.
Just as I drop my crsr bags it moons. This stock..
that’s why you don’t sell 52 week lows dumbass
Tbf I didn't, I sold in the high 25s a while ago but I also bought in above 40 so..
SOFI she’s our girl, she’s our girl if she can’t do it no one can 💁🏻‍♀️
Honestly, Great time to buy. Nice little dip, isn't going anywhere. this market is bullet proof for the next 2 months.
Just need to turn 600 into 6000 to recoup my losses for this week. 🤡
DASH IT!
Lost too much on AFRM and WISH. This is my final yolo play into NVDA. If these 11/19 calls don't print next week I quit
Nvda strike?
Bro fuck the mouse
They told me puts on the mouse I lose my house, but I bought a call and lost it all 😭
I'm almost break-even on PLUG it's actually unbelievable
I never want people to lose money but Wish bears fk off!
Market being boring, either dump or pump pussy
Just put 28k in Robinhood. After profiting about 1k today on SPY Puts. Gonna wait a week then put in a ton of spy calls for dec 31.
I'm a permabull but this sounds like a disaster waiting to happen but don't let my comment stop you from executing your get rich quick plan.
Ahh i'm not going to put in the entire amount on calls lol. It will of course be a diversified amount. Main reason is so i can day trade. This entire week I was in the +30-50% on put profit and I could do nothing but watch it disappear or cash out and take the 90 day restriction.
ah, yeah, PDT rule sucks
Oh yeah. I'd be about 2-3k richer if it wasn't for it!

Well Nov 18th my balance will be high enough i can day trade to my hearts content!

&#x200B;

Edit: Or should i say my wallets content!
Not having to worry about PDT is a great feeling but not sure about having $25k+ in RH.
Yeah it makes me a little nervous as well.
Who tf is buying rivian.
Smart retards
60k worth NVIDIA calls today… saw the PT update to $350 and went full retard. Down 3k so far :|
Exp?
Jan ‘22
Expiring when?  Next week?
$310c Jan 22
Same here but had them for a few weeks with a 11/19.  Except I am down a little more right now
I’ve in and out 3x this week and am up like 40k, little less now. Didn’t full send it this time lol
Same here up overall the last few weeks about the same 30k.  Then doubled down for earnings week, hopefully we don't get screwed
God speed buddy. I’d love to have a second run up to $320. Seems like EU pumps it nightly, but I don’t want to jinx us. Here’s hoping for a 310 close and a 325 open tomorrow
God speed as well
LCID and SOFI are trying so hard to carry my portfolio but I'm in so heavy PSFE they just can't overcome my retardation
(whispers “metaverse”)

UNITY +180%

u don’t even need to be making money to go up 5% everyday in this market
Where my $WISH homies at?
I didn’t realize today was absolutely nothing will moon Thursday. 

I got a feeling this market will be boring until next Monday.
PLUG?
But RIVN..?
My FB 12/3 calls will either recover or go to 0. I refuse to sell low
I'm with ya on the 12/10s. Not selling lol
Elon fanbois thought 1200 was on the cards
We did smh
Thank you SOFI, you did me well. Heavy volume guys, points to continuation of trend.
Fucking trashla. Smh
Yea we are in a bubble. Rivian could lose 95% of its value and still be over valued. A lot of people are gonna get fucked here
I’m casually standing by on the sidelines watching the chaos lol
that sofi wall at 24 is such a slut give in let my calls rip
Most traders taking the day off. They just left the algos on to pin it flat so they can relax on their yachts.
I thought traders only chill in lambo‘s?
Yeah, lambo sitting on their yacht. Why would you leave your lambo when you go sailing on your yacht?
> I don't want to get my lambo dirty.
Is PSFE the yolo![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)

Can’t go much lower IMO

“no way SPY could betray me”

bruh, it’s named “SPY”

(shakes head)

kids these days never played TF2
All of WSB last week: "Rivian is going to the moon!"

All of WSB this week: "WTF why is Rivian mooning?!"

I don't get it.
Like two different sets of peoples have different opinions?
I'm saying I didn't even see any negative sentiment about Rivian last week at all.
Its like the same people who kept saying tesla was overvalued at 200 in like jan 2020
Buying that DIS dip was the smartest thing I did all week
What is the return policy on BMBL calls?
Its possible but they have to hit you up first
I think I’ll be a pltr bag holder for life
11/15 500c. Spy lottery tickets.
You're donating your money to a rich guy
Can’t tell if you’re serious or not, either way this is retarded
Goddamn I could sell stupid OTM calls on weeklies if i was rich enough to own that much!
SPY bouncing around +40 cents -40 cents. 80 cents range? 

Bond markets closed. Algos have taken over. It’s a flat day. Pack it up and go home.
Papa Elon just going in dry inside me
To see HOOD  below its IPO price and GME above 200$ is lovely
Sounds emotional
Yup, I still hate them for their January shitshow
Today is a Theta day
$TLRY and $SNDL printing....they withstood the dip yesterday and going to higher highs...both going to surge and options are cheap.
It's gonna print hard
Uhhh. 205% iv for sndl is not cheap…

Just buy shares
options 6 months out in the money at .50 strike price for .33 cents is not a bad bet, 10 cents away and this stock is prone to spikes every now and then.
But youre essentially just getting 2:1 leverage with a lot more risk compared to if you just bought shares…
my stock is wrapped up in AI (AI C3) and RKT and LDI, BIGC, for long term plays
RIVN currently saving my port 🥰🥰
Wtf they never released the new Ghostbusters
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Sambambini (0/1) made a bet that NVDA would go to 333.0 when it was 298.4 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
PSFE at $4.20 bullish AF
Was PSFE money laundering for sex traffickers or somethjng?? This shit wiped me out 🤡
They basically admitted they have no plan on how to increase profit and revenue going forward. It's gonna sit in the 4's until they decide to come up with some fucking plan to make money.
Haven’t they made ton of acquisitions? How isn’t that helping their revenue? Fucking mindless idiots
> They are just buying companies that have no growth. It doesn't matter how many times they buy a company, it's not going to make them any money in the long run if they don’t grow their top line
This is a real person lol
The acquisitions they made were in dog shit. None of them are projected to help with growth through 2022. It's gonna be a rough year for this stock. I'm really trying not to cut my huge losses and move to a better opportunity.
The fuck are they making acquisitions for then? Useless fucking board.
> The acquisition of the company is a good thing, because it allows for more capital to be injected into the business. The board members are not useless and they have been involved in many successful companies before.
When is rivian going to plummet to 50
As soon as I get in that bitch
Maybe below 100 if youre lucky
When we're in the Metaverse.
Today doesn't count.  Banks are on vacation.  Even algos have holiday pay today.

This made me picture a little 1 inch tall Billy Joe Armstrong.
Sofi calls were the right move. Chances of her breaking 25 today?
I’m up in RIDE, PLUG, and RIOT. I’m gonna die I just know it
SELL WITH SOME CONVICTION
DUMP IT LIKE YOU MEAN IT
If I played spy options today I would have broken my table in half
That was me yesterday after I told myself to not do it. -40%
Bought some for next friday
How fucked am I with nov 26 spy calls 470
I feel like it’s realistic but I can also see it trading sideways between 460-468
Back to ath tomorrow or early next week fs
I can only hope 😭
Bought Nov 22 spy 470c today
I bought some too, they were on sale for some reason
you good bro got plenty of time
I might be a europoor but I can day trade all I want so that's something
Nvda is breaking
TSLA more flat than the planet 🌎
This is a true statement.

TSLA dumping so SPY can live
damn gonna need a miracle from AFRM. thought i set a stop loss but guess it didn’t go through and now i’m down 20k…
Oof
If you shit your diaper while wearing your Spacesuit, does the internal filtration system filter out the smell or nah?
Disney and Visa literally negative since Jan 4
You know its a shitty day when your hoping Wish dies
Turns out I was the quadruple bottom all along.
I’m ready to hold my stocks and not check my portfolio for a year
TsLa/apple red, googl/amzn almost red, fb not looking strong, mkts setting up for eod dump???
Probably, we really should go test SPY 454 before the santa clause rally
Yeah we should test some.lower levels but this mkt retarded so who knows!

NVDA trips over cash in the hallways. It will not stop for years
Yes
Wow. This will be an interesting one with such a big run up lately. I’ll dabble into just a few $hundred worth of puts for shits and grins.

If SPY goes up a dollar a day for 9 days straight, ill recover my funds.

Bought at $50s sold in $40s 🤡
SPY is hammered. Somebody get it a sandwich.
I hope whoever bought my AMD 130c for 11/19 is enjoying themselves
Why would u sell that lmaooo
wtf spy only has 20m volume today. how fucking insane is that
it's veterans day and the bond market is closed, it was always going to be a low volume day
I don't know whether it's a good or bad sign.
That 200 day moving average on Ford...impressive.  Don't know what that means, but fuck I'm buying calls.
Slowly but surely, we're going to tank big time in the next few weeks. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
For the first time in almost two months buying OTM spy calls on Monday will not work out for me.
> I'm sorry to hear that.
If I had a dime for everytime a CNBC talking head mentions inflation.

No one is talking about supply chain. Acting like once fed tapers everything goes back to normal.

Fuck outta here.
If Russia Invades Ukraine tonight is SPY green or red tomorrow?

girlfriend got mad at me for not knowing what times she should request off a year from now. 

women are absolutely crackers
Why is she asking you for specified times to take off one year in the future? Would you date her if she was a worm??
I mean we’re all technically worm food. Thinking of yourself as anything more is just retarded.
I bought a textbook on options… and 4 pages in.. I learned two things.
1. I need to stay away from options I don’t know what I’m doing
2. I need to learn to read

Just buy options on TQQQ and SQQQ and you’ll be safe.
At first I thought I found every way to fuck up when I lost $5k.
Then I knew I figured it out once I lost the next $5k.

Then I said time to load up $10k and make this back with one easy single bagger.

So, now that I’ve lost my first $30k, I know exactly how I’m gonna get it back with….. $123.76 by EOY
Are u me???
But u only liste a total of $20k in this post??? Happened to the other $10k? And Good luck homie, you can do it!

Raising Alpacas in Idaho.
Both Sports gambling and the Marajuana industries suffer from increasingly smaller margins with no moat differentiating themselves from competitors. In both cases they deal with heavy government regulation WHILE ALSO dealing with illegal offshore bookies and drug dealers. I feel like neither industry will do great in the future in terms of share holder returns
Both will be heavily regulated, so buy the biggest ones with the most lobbyist money.
so DKNG it is
If it's anything like how they took over DFS then absolutely.  I've been on board with them since their debut as a public company
This is the reassurance I need to double down 🤡. But seriously, I'll probably double down if it touches $40 again
Clowns unite at 40!
Instructions unclear, buying TLRY and swinging those gains over to DKNG
those stocks are so 2020

If you are buying rivian at a market cap greater than Boeing you deserve to lose money
I made 8 bucks!
And how many Boeing’s is Tesla?  Also crazy.
I don't know anything so I'm going to use this as justification for not getting in.
There's no doubt in my mind...none whatsoever...that Rivian is a 120B company. 

They've delivered almost **100 trucks**, I do not need any more proof than that.

$125/share is fair value, everyone should buy at these prices.
Yup. The steal on this one is going to be very obvious in hindsight!
It will dump within a couple weeks and never recover just like every other IPO in the last 2 years
Rivian has a pickup that starts at $67,500 and an SUV that starts at $75,000 that they'll deliver next year. I'm sure they're nice vehicles, but that price point is out of reach for many. 120B market cap.

Lucid has a luxury sedan ranging in price from $77,400 to $169,000. They say they'll have an SUV soon, I guess we will see.  73B market cap.

Nobody wants to hear this, but here I go anyway. Rivian and Lucid make nice vehicles but they're boutique manufacturers being valued like they're delivering an EV to every driveway tomorrow.

Canoo (GOEV) has a van ("lifestyle vehicle") slated for delivery in late 2022. They also have a commercial delivery van, pickup truck and sedan pending. The van starts at $35,000. Canoo's stated objective is to bring affordable EVs to the masses. 2B market cap.

Proterra (PTRA) currently makes and sells EV buses. EV buses are specifically named in the infrastructure bill. EVs are the future, but I don't think public transportation is going to vanish overnight. 2.6B market cap.

I don't know anything and my opinion has no value, but GOEV and PTRA seem like good value plays to me, if you're willing to be patient. Canoo's earnings call is 11/15, I expect Tattoo Tony Tequila to report that production goals are being met and on track. 

Position: 4,000 x GOEV @ $11.08, 250 PTRA @ $11.91.

What a fucking joke RH. Says I have $.48 buying power, try to buy a $.15 call and it says insufficient funds. This is why you use a real trading platform.
Is this a joke? I legitimately can’t tell
It is, got em
So, a call that costs $15. Fucking moron
It’s a joke boo 😘
LMFAO

👑 this man
Serious question. Why is China up bigly when Evergrande is defaulting?
Because it is not really defaulting, they just “delaying and restructuring the interest payments”
because China can print money too and they do. At least they reverse repo the shit out of it. I cannot be sure that this is the answer to ur question, tho.
It is not defaulting. They met their timeline.
Actually didn't but ok

Past movement really aren’t an indicator of future results. 

They ain’t lying when they say that
Are you saying there's no reason we continue melting green today?
No idea. The market is unpredictable this week. But I think if there’s a sense of relief of making it through the bad news cycle of CPI data, it might melt up.

Noticing a trend on some of these small cap retail companies that constantly get pumped, most have a decent short float > 10% but high institutional ownership, like > 100%.  Not sure how that happens?  I think this is why they constantly get bid up?

Some examples, LOVE, WING, YETI, PRPL, CROX

Plenty more im sure.
I always assumed that they just have low trading volume and large spreads so any buyers end up having to bump up their bids in order to fill.

You can add CELH to that list.
That’s probably part of it.  Maybe these funds in control of these shares just passes between each other? Idk just seems like there’s a racket going on.
Yeah i think its just algorithmic trading between institutions. Definitely suspicious, theres no reason for these companies to constantly go up.
Carvana too but I think they pumped it too hard >$50B, now it’s been on the downtrend. SEC does nothing of course.
in instiutional they count etf too. so in gigants like BlackRock shares counted like twice.

All the bear posts of ultimate doom and gloom due to inflation were my catalyst for going all in on tech yesterday lmao
Inflation = terrible for the economy, good for most equities. Inflation bad for market only cause it means rates are gonna get hiked sooner, probably. This is the summation of it, right?
It's unfortunately not that simple or we would be seeing a good sized pullback. The fed has acknowledged inflation but firmly believes it's temporary and is holding back with significant rate changes. Bears on here would have you believing inflation took everyone by surprise and that the fed and country are now panicked which is why they think a crash is imminent.
At what point does the market get nervous when every inflation reading is above expectation and climbing every month. Across the globe too. That's what I'm afraid of. When does the market question "transitory" instead of letting Powell pacify them so easily
So I get the fear, I traded during the China vs Trump trade wars and for a while thought things were going to shit and lost a lot of money buying puts. I learned to stop trading with my feelings, follow the trend, and if my gut is telling me shit is going to hit the fan like when covid first hit, I don't go all in and grab a few hedges.

it could easily break lower throughout day
I bought a 2023 leap
No, their PE is that of a tech company and clearly they aren't being that successful at their streaming platforms. It will continue to dip until you get close to where it started before Disney+ announcement. Keep in mind they already sold movies before that, so it's not like streaming is a totally new revenue stream.

When you have a lot of money in stocks, are you obligated to live right on the edge of a golf course?

I think, with ten million in stocks the bank gives you a free house by the golf course.

Duh
Well I thought of it when he responded to that saving world hunger thing but now I’m sure sure. He knows more than we think, beyond just Tesla (the company he did not actually start!)
Or causing panic. I think,  he expects major correction in markets
Yes

Needs to be someone high profile or with a history of turn arounds
Bozos
Maybe jacquie
THIS MARKET ANNOY ME
So are we loading up in DIS yet?
I just purchase two (!) whole shares
How has Dillards doubled in price in the last month. I thought they died with shopping malls.
They make Dilaudid (Hydromorphone) in the back, that's the only way I see them weathering any storm.
Which DIS calls yall getting
Based on 52 week performance, maybe itm leaps.
160c 9/16/22
CRSR pumping today, i think?
When will PLTR dominate the software industry?
Word is in 2030 it'll finally hit 30.
When all my calls expire and I sell all my shares.
Later. Either buy a ton of it and don't think about it for 10 years, or ignore it, maybe even short it in short term
Any reason for the CRSR pump?
Wondering the same thing. Did any news come out? Either way I’m happy these bags are getting lighter, 600 shares at 32 avg fml
700 shares at 45 😂😂😂
Ouch, it’s definitely time to average down, throw another 20k at it and bring it into mid 30s. The stock will run, it has amazing fundamentals, we just need to have patience with this one.
WTF WISH up nearly 15% despite red flags everywhere, are the dip buyers circle jerkin each other?!?!
Red flags were at 25, not 5.
No the red flags are customer base jumping ship & just over 3 more quarters before insolvency.
Market forgot about inflation again today
CRSR popping off
PSFE down 40% today, might get a call or 2 going
Seems a bit overdone no?
I mean it's almost at its all time low, so it can either go up, or bust the floor lmfao the premiums are cheap enough 🤷‍♂️
BBBY hodln the line like none other. 

Fucking beautiful
I am not selling until I see fit
Never selling, great stock
Man it is a good thing it takes investors less than 24 hours to forget about the crippling inflation.
Here's the thing about inflation... you really feel it when you pull your money out of the casino and it isn't doing anything for you.
SPY being such a hoe rn. Pick a fucking direction. So I can buy FDs
I bought a shit ton of puts just Bc it’s friday tomorrow. Calls on Monday.
Yo gotta love my FSR doing work!
Wen SPY fly?  I am way over leveraged in 1/21 500c
Wow, just look at $SOFI not shitting the bed after open anymore. A real grown up, big boy stock.
11/12 calls vomiting up money
Feels good.
just need to time my exit strategy
Loaded up on Dis Dec 3 165 calls. Easy money
I own the shittiest stocks ever. DKNG and CRSR. And I bought them near all time high. I’ll probably have to wait 5 years to breakeven. Fuck this.
CRSR should do well, I just sold yesterday so it'll probably run to $50 by EOM.
Chin up, you missed PSFE!
Can paysafe really go below 4? That's a juiiicy discount
Is it a discount when it's a straight crash, or a red flag?
Bears edging right now at the thought of SPY going red
Indeed. The fomo made me take the YEET strategy, [Your Earnings Evaporate Tonight](https://photos.app.goo.gl/o9T7zbw173x3YEP3A)
Idgaf no way the fed lets this shit tank all the money printing for nothing
yeah fed won’t let it crash until new year
The fear is when something beyond their control happens, and they have no bullets left.
Got greedy again as usual and now bagholdin
Rivian up 18% today always inverse wsb sentiment
It’ll go down eventually. That shit is not the 2nd most valuable carmaker lol
Excitedly awaiting the puts
Well it's 5th right now lol :P
Weed stocks are still so low. Tlry 🚀
Wonder if the low cost one will crush earnings today. I bought 50 contracts in case they crush it.
SNDL? Maybe?
C'mon LCID! Get my 45 in tha money!!
How high do you think it should go? I want to bail short term and am up 20%
BofA raised price target on LCID to 60 (yesterday).
Earnings on Monday, dunno what that means though. Barely shipped any cars so don’t see any positive hit from it
Tickle 46, low 47? Probably gonna be some profit taking across the market late today and tomorrow... if you didn't fold yesterday. I'm spooked. Take profits
Yeah yesterday has made me nervous
Never seen Tesla this flat
It’s working up the nerve to jump off and end it all
Literally the only thing that hurts my plays right now.
Decided to catch the knife on PSFE. Fuck it. Seems like a huge overreaction.
4.5c 12/31, 75 bucks.
Where’s the spy rip
Are you my calls?
I don’t think my ban bet is gonna play out lol, see ya guys in a week
Feels like the end of 2018
Boolish
$dkng holding at these levels. Keep an eye on it guys 🚀
I’m looking at feb calls.  Atm is only 5$ and they expire week after super bowl.
I picked up some Jan calls. Hoping it bounces soon though
Nerds be like BUT MUH FUNDANENTALS like ok bro go stare at a spreadsheet all day I’m yoloing for the lolz
This is either a bear flag or the bottom
Bottom
Dis 1/20/23 $170 calls…… 

I’m not a financial advisor. However, I do like Tendies!
160c 9/16/2022 here
Nice! Those are solid
How much those cost?
$1,600 per contract when I bought.
Rivian ripping
I’m gonna be in poverty forever 😅
Sell the platinum
Anyone FOMOing into Rivian?
Dumb dumbs
Polestar is better
Not yet. But thanks for checking in.
No LCID
"inflation" is literally a synonym for "pumping"
I was up late last night inflation your mom
Eyeing up $V, $PYPL, $PTON calls for January. Anyone else?
I've been buying V leaps, hoping it'll roar back.  But I make really bad investment decisions.
Yep, V Jan 225c and PYPL Feb 250c for me.
Come on Nvda got a huge price target.
PLUG moving up
Paysafe == Paylost !  What the fuck happened ? Ffs I’ll be bagholding forever !
God damn it, Tesla. 

Stop. Fucking. The. Market.
BBBY about to waffle stomp shorts who thought they were cute this morning
Ewww
LCID looking good. PSFE punked us
sTeEeeVe MaDdEn
Sold my calls for a 50% loss and it starts ripping

You’re welcome
Fisker you sweet son of a bitch. I love it and we still got the car show in 6 days. From OTM to ITM with two weeks of tendies to go
It’s picking up speed
PAPA FISK !!
Buy plug calls 45 expiring tomorrow. Thank me later.
😈
Sold mine, just bought back in because of this. Guess we’ll see 🙃
Is LCID on Acid ?
did someone fed SPY/QQQ a viagra when we weren't looking?
NBD but I won $30 on a $10 scratch off today. 

Tootsie rolls for EVERYONE
You've made more money than 90% of this sub. Congrats!
For the first time since Feb 2 of this year, my portfolio is finally in the green.

And now that I have said something, I will lose it all.
POV: you held BYND like a retard
POV: you're an American shuddering at the idea of an $8.99 plantburger then drive to McDick's for a Travis Scottburger instead.
New plan: bought a fuck ton of DIS calls. Let's hope she gets back to 170 next week 🙏
RIOT 42 CALLS expiry 26Nov, thank me later
Evergrande bankruptcy already priced in.
CCP priced it in day 1.
Tesla going down. Sloooooowly but surely
Pls just pump once I will cash out this time 😭
Is Lordstown still a piece of shit?
Got in it yesterday, money so far, might get out b4 ER
Shoukd I buy poots?
I have a weird feeling, those fools might just beat it, kinda torn if pullout now or staying in
Idk, I might just leave it alone
Yeah, I’ll close before close
They may run it up on earnings ah
Stop fucking with my brain bruh 😆Ok I’ll leave shares in, see what happens, fuk it
Sell half, I mean I'm so torn like I know they're gonna post no money but if they do, they run, I may get a straddle for funzies
Ok bud, sounds good 🤞

TESLA $1069
wow the algos catching SPY every time at the same level

ah, who cares about today

this volume is silly
Hey SEC please deport Vlad to Bulgaria
If SoFi brings options trading I'll probably move everything to them. Opened an account for the Rivian access and I don't hate the interface.
Is it better than Robinhood’s interface?
I dunno, haven't used it.
Frikking PYPL! Aren’t you done selling off yet 😒😒😒😒😒😒
Get your ass back under 5 where you belong WISH
Bond markets are closed. Algos don’t know what to do anymore. Gonna be a flat day.
Goddammit Ford you're such a boomer stock.
We just went through a serious rip. Now we're dip/sideways. Completely normal  


You guys got to stop buying FDs so much and buy with a couple month expiration jfc
SPY: sideways is a direction
Damn PSFE good thing I sold my shares earlier I could buy back double the amount but idk anymore
Picked up some leaps. Fuck it

Do u agree that market is weak despite a flat TSLA
GME and BBBY looking tasty rn
Quick pump and dump on negg, QS  might have some steam left in it
Love QS
$QS and $MP have been rockets
I see seas of green, 
Shrek dildos too, 
I see them bloom, 
For me and you, 
And I think to myself, 
What a wonderful world!
I’m built differently, I’m built differently, I’m Bill Dipperly
Did Robinhood just close anyone else's position
Biden administration is saying Russia will invade Ukraine in order to stop the bond market from selling tomorrow and crashing the stock market. We will rally tomorrow on a tame bond market!
Everything is fake today, including this message
Of course it is we’re living in a simulation world!
So nothing is fake
BABA singles day numbers are out: $84.5 billion compared to last year $74 billion.
Hopefully this couples with a nice ER next week
I wonder if rivian will become the new tsla
It’s the new LCID
2 Teslas

Whats the deal with their chart last year?

Someone please just tell me what to do

I wonder if SPCE is good at 19? Do they still have warrants out?
Within a year it will def do some more hype runs
Yeah planning ahead a bit. Might buy some shares. Downside looks like 15.
I agree. I'm tempted but will wait some more
I got a big dick and a small brain
**Make Ken Griffin a mod**
$ROOT up almost 30% today. No love
So does trading stocks move the indexes or does trading the indexes move stocks.
Let’s go $SoFi!

I’ll finally get to buy the chain that’ll always give me back pain!
Theta gang killling me today. Spy is dead
NVDA give me 310 you whore
Im just trying to get rich enough to shotgun a blunt out of Margot Robbie’s ass. 

Is that *so much to ask*?
How does she pull the smoke into her ass in the first place 🤔
You stick the mouth end in her ass and hit the cherry man. 

I guess you could also use a bicycle pump type situation
Why did I jus bruh apple calls

Meme stocks are going up hence algos pushing all of them.
I’ve never liked rollercoasters, SPY…
Just happy im tall enough to ride it
Wtf sofi yu whore
Lordstown puts
This fking HOODrat of a stock is pissing me off.
This is the kind of insightful market commentary that I come here for. Bloomberg, eat your heart out.
Why F is ducking down?
ROOT gonna pop off after hours and tomorrow
Why?
$ROOT vol is taking off. Lunch is over boys.
Alibaba should buy out Wish if they want to penetrate American e commerce market..

Look at SHEIN… these bitches are buying Chinese made products left and right
Wish is American Taobao. This idea legit has legs.
Sofi jumping because I wrote near ITM calls. You’re welcome everyone
I rolled my cc from 22.5 to 25 like a week ago and its getting tested already. Probably just gonna let it go at this point
wrote some 26 cc expiring tomorrow and even I'm sweating it
Fuck you TSLA and AAPL
People keep trying to convince others on $root and $wish , Last time I saw you guys say something like that was $SDC and we all know how that went
CRO and CMO both left root within the same month last month. Anyone who thinks root is a good play is an idiot
Woke up at 7:30 , barely eating breakfast. The later I have my first meal of the day the easier this diet is.
Vape pens with high nicotine contest will suppress your apatite.
I’ll just use nicotine patch and see how it goes
Also eat later in the day so you’re not hungry before bed. 

If you’re into it, use caffeine as an appetite suppressant works very well.

Congrats on SOFI btw
Gonna go buy ephedrine and caffeine today for that. Already using fiber and other stuff to keep my appetite down. 

And thank you. It’s saving me so hard from the PSFE and SDC disasters lmao
PYPL ever gonna bounce back?
Right after I sell probably
Good buy right now.  200 seems to be mortal support
I am wondering the same
I am $ROOTing for everyone to buy RN! Lets gooo.
🤩
EVGO power hour today. Be there.
I’m many days late and currently it’s still working out 😳
POWAAAAAA HOOOOOURRRRR
With heavy news today of AA unloading his shares, why is AMC up today?

20 mill volume at 2:30.   ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
When I sort comments by ‘Top’ I feel like I’m reading comments out of a WSB fortune cookie
PYPL RSI is MASSSIVELY oversold
And the indices are massively overbought.
Fck they have V pinned all day
V will have its day
I keep grabbing calls so I hope that day is tomorrow.
I wonder why. Opened down -2% with no news..?
SPY, can you trade more sideways for the people in the back
Bynd price slashed from $79 to $54 by Goldman. buy puts
Gonna need an end of day options play.

Even looking at FDs
$FUBO gonna bounce big soon, just don't know if it is tomorrow or not
NVIDA $315 or $310

AMD

Spy
Bounce on SPY tomorrow? If I buy calls you better get puts though because they’ll probably be a ten bagger
If you ever posted about anything I’ve bought, FUCK YOU
Hard to see how we don't pump into close. And all day tomorrow. And all of next week, too.
I bought TSLA calls and I'm ready to get hurt.
$1190 11/12 baby 👌🏻 doesn’t have to hit, just has to get closer
I have puts. We both are getting fucked though, should have bought flats for today
NEGG you little tease, show me more
I'm still down 20% fml
100% in amd brrrrrrr
Yes
How many simulations deep do you think our existing metaverse is
69 last time me and visualmod checked
We're all NPCs from a metaverse created by a long dead species.
The Metaverse is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.
* 46. Every election it gets deeper.
If so much is green why do I feel so red… 😔

^(*theta*)
Everything rally 🚀
Is it safe to get into pltr now?
I'll never mentally recover from that
SPY calls yesterday will haunt me for a while
I swear I would never touch pltr but here I am again  and again
Buying the DIS dip is probably the safest play you could possibly make.

Also NVDA is gonna run up pre earnings.
Psfe's 1yr chart looks like my folio 😅
visualmod was my sexual awakening
This shit is boring as fuck, im locked and loaded, when are we going to see some movement?
 jump in and get rekt by theta like the rest of us nerd

Wtf did you just link. I’m too afraid to click on it.
It's not what you think. Srs. They catch and shut down loli subs.
Oh. Nice. I still turned my VPN on before clicking haha.
I bought some rivn shares yesterday and I sold it today for a 6$ profit, best trade in my life. I belong to here right ?
I bought 16 at 115 sold at 116.50 today.  $4 profit after fees
Even a legacy hard disk company like Seagate $STX is up 30% month to date, wtf!
Metaverse is gonna need storage yo
i always sell my profitable options so every time i look at my porkfolio its all negative.
Fool me once... ah... shame on you. Fool me twice! uh... um... shame on you again
Start up idea:
We work but for home offices. We rent people desks, monitors, and chairs for the cost of a rent payment.

Everything rally combined with Santa claus rally is on now
Elon sell wen?
He's working his way one finger at a time.

Prob won't completely offload till next year.
But that keeps price suppressed for too long.
Already happened
The rest of it. He should sell and be done
Not if he wants to do it without losing money.
he only sold 10% of his 10%.
Monday was the first lot. Look at the filings.
paypal going under 200 what a joke
It's becuase I was sitting on212 c 11/12 for ever and was to ape like to get out when green
The bjs behind Wendy’s will drive the new economy
Anyone else buy DIS calls today? I am bagholding now and need company
No calls, just buy the dip
Same. Shares on sale. Earnings post holidays are going to be...well they could suck as well, but I'm just accumulating on dips.
Leaps ?
Leaps, for sure but itm
Bought shares
I smell panic, and bitch. And it’s mostly from people with FDs. 

Poors go bye now 👋
Does smoking weed make me a better trader? Asking for a friend. He bought a shit ton of RIVN shares while being 12/10 high on edibles. Pleasant surprise today.
Anyone snagging more dis calls for tomorrow
F  $20 eow?
will trevi fountain piss into my own mouth if amzn breaks 3600 by end of next week
Make it a ban bet
unless JPOW is gently stroking its cock each week, the market goes down
He's been stroking the markets cock so much it's sheets are like ryvita crispbreads.
Is fintech dead? bought calls on both SQ and PYPL, and they keep on dipping lol
SQ usually recovers quite quickly but have to say that I’m bagholding pypl and sq Jan 22 calls
FOUR 

Shift4 Payments 

Contract with SpaceX for Payment Processing of Starlink Internet 

Announced the contract yesterday at the literal bottom of their chart. Going to double in a month
Only fintech worth holding is AFRM
Picked up 11/19 Disney calls. Don’t fuck with the mouse
ONE bad earnings and suddenly the company is going under? I don’t buy it.
It’s filling a gap left from last December 12/11… it’s going down, not up from here
PSFE being investigated by Johnson Fistel law firm. LMFAO.
Apes, call this firm if you lost your life savings.
Damn, was really hoping TSLA would temporarily drop into the low 300s to save my puts. Guess I'm just big fuk instead. Oh well
Can AMC just die already like bruh the CEO cashed out too
Sell another 1% before close mElon
My AMD is printing as always. The good old faithful.
PYPL weekly chart makes the 2020 crash look microscopic
This tsla chart does not spark joy
Bull flag pattern building
Does anyone else yell at the tickers in the public?
No meet Kevin stream today?
Lmaoooooooooooooooooooooo
Sell puts into volatility. If assigned wheel and deal. Rinse and repeat.
Spy ripping today
of course as soon as i out of spy calls.
You let that little dip yesterday get to you I’m guessing
I have 11/12 11/19 and 12/10 just looking for +2.0 % by EOM
I think todays is bad day to get back into spy calls as everybody gonna buy it?
Try buying a little further out ATM
I am think spy 500 dec31.
Possibly but I’m out until 2022 after these calls run their course
I buy them a month out. Gotta give yourself a good runway.
Naw I bought spy calls, sorry fam.
Hey you may be right this time never know you still had cash to buy them so you haven’t lost it all yet
Naw I'm broke, I took out a sofi loan to by sofi and spy calls...
No f in way ! I did the same last month and doubled up paid loan off now I’m using free Money!!
It must be so frustrating being a bear 🐻
It's why they're always looking for honey and picnic baskets and shit
I guess any news about TSLA is bullish
Dave Portnoy announcing on Twitter he's hosting an "emergency" press conference today as if he's actually somebody.
he stands on tippy toes when he takes pictures to appear taller
He’s fucking annoying
that grinds my gears. like stfu, nobody cares about you.
Is the emergency that nobody cares about him?
BULLISH TECH BULL MARKET UNTIL THE END OF TIME 



STAY IN THE MARKET AND GET RICH BOYS!
Up 2% today! 

Down 20% yesterday
Oh shit where the fucking sell button
Holy fuck buying Disney calls at close yesterday was a fucking terrible play

[deleted]
Getting crowded behind Wendy's
Well, congratulations on your new minimalist lifestyle.
I think we need to pullback more 
We can’t just go straight up for weeks on end

Right ?
> I think it will.
Use the money you save on payments for fd’s
Houses are overrated. You be aight.
Hold on. Rivian doesn't even have any revenue?!?!
THEYVE SHIPPED 42 VEHICLES, MOSTLY FOR STAFF
They barely have any vehicles at all, and have never made any for mass production
Surprised? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
and a higher valuation than GM or Ford
How can anyone take one look at Rivian and not realize EVs are a massive bubble just like dotcom in 2000
Oh yeah.  Theres been lots of mini bubbles last couple years but the EV one is the only one sure to pop…just a matter of how bad and who survives
I dont think anyone disagrees, but whennwill the bubble pop? Dont end up looking like burry
> When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
Yeah I’m sure as shit not shorting (yet) but I also can’t bring myself to go long at this point
Just don't be balls deep when it pops
At this point it feels safer to not be long at all and just try to hop in and short on the way down
I have sold as many electric vehicles as rivian
When's your IPO dude? Can I get in early?
Some of you people really suck at DD, I’ve bought so many of your recommendations and I’m fucked. Seriously you guys need to step it up
I keep thinking but nothing happens
Suck at your wife’s DDs
Blaming others cus you’re too retarded to think for yourself lol
damn someone couldn’t find the joke
I gave you the lol what more do you want
Only in option land can you go from +400% to -80% in like 48 trading hours.  This is fucking bananas.  Should have walked away with profit when I could have.
I've been burned too many times by getting greedy.  

I went from a millionaire on GME options to back down to very low six digits.

Always take profit.  It's a hard lesson to learn
If ur up 400% u better take it🤣
I mean what else do u expect 10000%?
Dear SPY gods, 


Please move your price to 480 today. I know this is not too much ask  to during this transitory era.
You have to sacrifice something. With out the sacrificial offering your prayer is useless. What do you offer up in sacrifice?
> I offer up my dignity.
i dont think its worth that much
I offer up my wife, her boyfriend said I get to watch if SPY goes up.
A marine wore his boots to the bar last night. 

Tucked in.

It was so fucking funny… Mf was trying way too hard

Then when someone pointed it out, he got offended and did the

 “my brothers and sisters died for this country yadada”

And then he tried to fight that person


I did my 6 years in the Army, but holy shit that was fucking boot as hell.
Either a poser or a fucking fresh out boot that aint learned yet. We don't do that shit.
But did he drive a mustang and have a fat girlfriend?
Challenger with 19% rate
🐻 got trapped yesterday. Thank you Elon.
Heonlyssold25%ofwhatheneedsto
Imagine thinking a steady grind down to sub -1% is a bear trap 🤡
He probably bought puts near the bottom
SOFI going to 🔥🚀 today
The spy dip might just be over. The bottoms in. Same for tesla.
Good morning everyone. Have a great day
Anyone else bought dirtcheap Tesla calls in last 3  days? Looks like its about to print. 🙏🙏🙏🚀🚀🚀

Idk if i'm just cynical but every time I hear a higher up say "A happy employee is one that knows their work impacts society" I cringe. I have never once cared whether my work impacts society, I only want to work on something that interests me and pays well. For fucks sake, I want to work in Finance, how the fuck does that impact society besides negatively?
That's just corporate propaganda to brainwash people into accepting offers lower than the top of the market.  Hiring managers value naive, dumb and loyal over smart given the choice
But i'm just wondering who actually believes that shit. I do have a few friends who don't make a lot but are happy at their jobs but it's not because they "kNoW tHeIr cOnTriBuTinG tO sOciEty" it's because their company gives them interesting work and their team is nice. I care primarily about pay but a close second and third is interesting work and a good team. I currently have all three so i'm not looking but the moment I get an offer with higher pay, interesting work, and a good team why would I not take it?
It used to be every tech company would sell that line, but I dont know if it's fallen out of favor or maybe execs/hiring managers reserve it for entry level/inexperienced candidates so I dont hear it much anymore.

I've been in faang for a while now, but i def remember the theme of 'making the world a better place' in the company all hands at the startups i used to work at.  Actually now that i think of it, i think my current company's allhands also hint at it
I’m a member of society. 

If my job pays well and I’m happy then it’s benefitting society.  

Fuck all the rest of you all.

NJ ordered plastics straws to be only by request now, as the state starts halting plastic usage. and it's fucking hilarious seeing people get so violated at dunkin donuts cuz they gotta ask for a straw.
Who the fuck is drinking coffee out of a straw?
they look blue collar so probably drinking minty fresh berry bonananaza coolatas.
Come to think of it, I'm blue collar, and one of my coworkers comes in every day with a giant Starbucks thing and it comes with a straw. I don't think we can be friends anymore
you should start randomly stealing his straw and see how he reacts.
I can't tell if i'm just depressed or hate people.

I kinda feel bad for bankrupt movie theater investors. This is why big money shorts shit companies; retail investors are often retarded and just hand over their money to shit companies who give themselves bonuses and sell their own stock. Activist shorting is good.
My AMC puts are flat despite the stock dropping so much.  They have January expy though and are WAY otm.  They are what I think the stock is worth, which is $18 😂
They're selling popcorn in stores now so it will be fine apparently

$SOFI, $PTRA and $STEM all did well in Q3 earnings, but overall market cucked my portfolio before that. Ended up flat with not a single damn difference since last Friday.
Has anybody heard anything from Kim Jong Un recently
He just went out for a pack of cigarettes and should be back any minute now
just like my dad. but its been 26 years
well, his brand is probably just hard to find
Sorry son I ran into Jane Goodall
He still loves you. There's just a really long line at the store.
We were talking last night, he is good diet is working out, said he no longer eats the fat people and lost another 10 pounds
Saw him in the gym yesterday beating his PB and smacking your girl on the ass
I seen him the other day at the YMCA in a track suit.
chatted with him waiting for food at Panera Tuesday
Yeah he hit me up earlier. Said him and boo gonna chill today, might go bowling
I heard he's vacationing at Mara Lago.
Alright, get out of these ill-advised puts for a loss then go all in on MSFT calls.

Oh great.
I’m poor for now
And probably for always
So spending 1k on 465c at close WAS a good idea?
2.03 premium. Lets see how we open.
I picked up 463c nearly at the bottom of the dip yesterday, might sell at open depends on what it looks like at 9:30

Not a bear but earnings puts are like a market cheat code right now. Every stock that misses drops 30%. It’s like getting +1000 odds on a coin flip. Half the time you lose but when you win you win way more.
That chegg drop was so profitable for puts I hate I wasn’t in on it
shorts may be more consistent than puts at ER, because IV prices that in somewhat
Why I think this trade is working so well now is because the indexes are at ATH so Iv is relatively low on puts. Sure you pay a little more for earnings but for example PayPal puts were pricing in a 3% move and it dropped 12%. Indexes look good but outside of fang + Tesla Msft it’s a bloodbath.
But shorts have an infinite loss potential. With puts you can only lose the premium paid.
IV isn’t completely pricing in these dramatic earnings moves we’ve seen. SNAP for example puts were like +11500% or something autistic
i had no idea today was veterans day. i logged onto work early and I honestly have no idea if I have the day off or not
That's too funny. If you work at a bank you have the day off.
I work for a software company in public sector, normally I would assume I don't have the day off but since it's in the public sector it's a realistic possibility. I've only been here for two months so I have no idea how to view the company calendar
Well don't ask anyone. They will figure out you're retarded.
What if everyone shows up doing that exact thing and you are actually off.
Doubt you’re off bro. Tech works on vet day.
I saw an announcement on Schwab banks were closed.  Not much in the news about honoring our Vets.
It’s actually quite sad how little people care about Veterans Day.
Wendy’s has a $27 price target

If ford could do something retarded and go up like 30% today, I'd be super happy.

My 2023 $10 LEAP is looking great. Buy time my guy, its way less stressful.
Yeah but that’s what, $4000 per call? $10 in 2023

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/69PutsOnYourPuts69 (0/1) made a bet that INMD would go to 100.0 when it was 87.8 and it did not. They were automatically banned for two weeks.

To get out early they have to: **'or i'll shave and eat my beard trimmings u/shopbitter did i do it this time?'**
Sold PSFE at $8 and was pissed, not anymore. Time heals some wounds
No inflation today
Fuck I’m gonna get banned in a few hours
5 day ban buddy see you on the other side
PSFE was supposed to be the next PYPL. Wtf happened
It will be, in 10 years
PYPL isn't even the next Paypal anymore.
I'm starting to think the only reason WISH is still alive is because I hold puts. Other stocks cliff dive on HALF the negative news they came out with. I don't get it.
I've made alot of mistakes while learning to invest, I just didnt think psfe would do me like this....
I fucked with PSFE earnings back when it was around $14 and got fucked, never again lol
Here’s a super easy pro tip that every noob needs to know: avoid SPACs. Yes there are one or two that worked out but the vast majority are mediocre companies that just wanted to cash in on a speculative retail frenzy and they merged at valuations way higher than what they are worth.

Thanks Daddy.
So, do we think elon pauses and lets the stonk moonshot today and Friday before resuming selling next week?
Isn’t he done?
he sold 1%, just 9% more to go.  He needs to give it a breather so you kids can buy the price back up.
Not even close, at like 25% of the low end estimates of how much he would sell to hit the 10% from Twitter poll. I guess there is always the possibility he stops before that threshold 🤷
Can AFRM
Go up $10 more please lmao

It's better than "this is a 2 day correction." and proceed to buy 1dte SPY calls 10 minutes before it tanks and I'm out 10k like that
I love me some 2dte SPY calls though.

I have never tripled down on a position that I already know is going to be otm tomorrow. Until i bought TSLA puts. Shit can hit the fan 2 minutes from now
Called it
These HUT bags heavy right now ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
DIS rebound to 170 EOW?
Investors day tomorrow so probably
Tomorrow is EOW lmao

What should I throw 1k in? BBBY calls 👀
iv too high
This Tesla put not doing anything I’m going into calls so you guys feast
Time to go long China
BBBY shorts digging their own grave trying to keep her under 24, once she breaks through its on like Donkey Kong
I’m telling ya. NVDA earnings. Play the run up over the next few days.
What's your PT
AMD calls?
Sold a put on Viacom start of week. Ghost of Billy still haunting the stock though.
I fucking love uranium
Insanity how I’m in WISH and SDC but I’m slightly up on WISH and slightly down on SDC but they’re not even bags. 

My biggest bag  is now PSFE lol
whats the most money you've ever lost tren?
I once lost $5,000 overall when I first started options. My biggest loser on a position has been BABA credit spreads that im finally threading above water now.
is your portfolio over 100k? cuz if thats the case 5k is not bad at all for a day loss..
No it’s about half of that. That 5k loss was like half my account at the time bc I switched from theta gang to option buying lol. 

You finally spotted some non sexual comments from me this morning, what a rarity 😏
this is [true.so](https://true.so) weird not seeing you horny. I'm in that position rn ... 5k loss with a 12k portfolio and I just discovered options. they Might not be for me lol
Driving to get my braces adjusted lol give me a sec brb 🤓
Wtf 🤣🤣🤣ok
Go look at my new comment. The horny Tren you know is back 💁🏻‍♀️ 

But yeahhh option buying is a scam. It’s really only for people who have a lot of money and aren’t scared to take risks bc if they lose it it won’t make a difference in their lives. Switch to theta gang, when I lost my 5k I clawed it all back by selling puts. Tren can teach you, just be nice to him 😏
I'll be nice to whoever helps me make money lol. I've pretty much blown up my account this week. Do you sell CSPs or do you sell Naked puts?
CSPs and credit spreads. A year or longer to expiration. I’m shielded from big drops that way. Very slow but my first concern is not losing money and protecting myself. 

Try it on something. Just shoot off 1 or 2 credit spreads on a stock you think isn’t likely to go down much. Don’t choose a stock you think is gonna go up… that’s a plus if it happens but don’t sell puts that way. Assume the stock will trade flat or even go down but not enough to reach your strikes
Damn what else you buying so I can inverse?
I bought SOFI at 14.50 and still holding 😜
I love Sophie
if the CEO of COIN were to be spotted taking a runny shit in the middle of a park and then scooping it up with his hands to rub it all over his face, would that be enough for COIN to drop 30% overnight?
Need a safe play that will turn my 50k to 100k in 10 days.
NFA buy calls on oversold small cap stocks
PSFE making my stomach drop

Here's your BBBY entry, the battle vs the shorts has just begun, I'm all inin shares and 24c let's fucking go
I don’t know how paysafe doesn’t get bought out at these prices
Just picked up 13500 shares.. look at other fintech companies after earnings and then 2 days later. Bullish
Wow, PYPL has been fucking drilling since that Pintrest announcement

I figured out the stock market. I will apply for a position at WISH, will withdraw all their cash with the company credit card, then literally set it on fire. 12$ EOY confirmed.
any earnings plays for AH today or pre market tomorrow?
LAZR puts
This one of those fuk your calls & puts spy kind of day
ROBLOX feels like it could be the next UPST or NET which just goes on an unbelievable run from a valuation standpoint with a ton of momentum chasers on it.

Has all the metaverse hype and is the only gaming stock that looks really attractive right now.

Not saying it's going to happen, but if I had to pick any stock to just go on a random $50-100 run over the next 2 months... that's it.  Look at the call volumes on it right now.
Within 2 weeks some ape named Gherkit will post a DD here on credit swaps, volatility hedging and option plays for Nov 23, Dec 22 and Jan 24 on GME and you will FOMO in once again.. for it is tendie season. 🍌
This entire month has been: buy overvalued garbage companies and sell undervalued stocks at 52 week lows
Since like March that has been this  🤡 market.
ASTS having a solid day.
If Covid gets better then interest rate raise moves up: bad. If Covid gets worse then supply chains kink, earnings fall: bad. Whatever happens: bad. Market?

Market green….
Move on BLNK and CPNG?
Taking a break this week. I’ll play again next week and get in for NVDA earnings
See you in 3 hours retard
SPY keeps messing with my heart 💔
Why is PYPL down so much?
They announced they are moving away from Ebay.
people sell low and buy high wtf do you expect
So you can now afford it
$FUBO to 0 on an absolutely amazing earnings call where they announce great membership numbers and a buyout of a 4M subscriber euro company and also that their sports betting is going live in Q4, smfh
And no profits. The part you missed out on.
All goes quiet on the TSLA front...
Losing all my money made from rivian on spy calls and puts
Puts printing beyond beating my meat
Inflation only bad if there's a decision to try to lower it. Otherwise higher numbers = higher numbers
Tessy been suckin all day
After doing some deep AI market analysis, soul searching, environmental conditions, some geometry using the pythagorean theorem, and a new clean underwear, I value SPY at 500.
Finally a real world example of someone using the Pythagorean theorem!

$RIDE earnings today....going to $4
So NIO has a shitty earnings this quarter but because citi raises their price target it *Rises*? fuck outta here. any other time it gets a price target the mf goes flat
Probably riding the rivian hype.
Post office closed today so I'm off.

Gonna beat my dick to a bloody pulp.
You should have known the crash was not yesterday cause people were telling you the crash was yesterday, as outsiders we aren’t supposed to know when the rug is pulled away from us so just stay aware 🧐
If you missed NVDA and AMD check out INDI. I wouldn’t buy today on this huge rip but it’s a $1.4B market cap semi startup you can hold until the end of time for 100x tendies
End of time seems like bagholding to me
It’s only holding the bag if you’re in the red dipshit
Can we have everything rally for f sake
Oh here is the sell off
Pretty weak sell off.
I’d say it looks pretty bullish but this is a scary market of course lol
Today looks choppy to me, but I mostly don't know what I'm talking about.
Ya it’s really hard to predict, I usually try to watch the moving averages because the SPY always makes it’s return given enough time
I was thinking today would be flat after yesterdays drop (I mentioned going short volatility). I don't like being right when I'm not invested in the answer because I get too confident. That was all based on RSI and 5ema.
I was thinking the pullback would make it to atleast 460 before a rebound since that was a big resistance point, or possibly the September ATH around 453. The market is extremely choppy today
Daily RSI cooled down below overbought, and the price crossed the 5ema, but not super hard. I haven't been marking support and resistance lately, just trying to figure a direction while I'm not holding options. But yeah, it'll have to break the weekly candle before hitting 460 and I didn't think today was the day because of the above. Flat while the market decides where to go.
 Glad I finally broke down and bought Sofi earlier this week
Oh shit, it's Thursday... my weeklies still have time
Kick in the door wavin the 44 all you heard was papa don’t hit me no moreeee
Costco calls I bought this morning are already ITM

Theta McGangbang today
Cramer and the rest of CNBC basically begging people to buy Disney.  It’s amazing how they pick and choose which stocks to pump after an earnings miss.
amazes me that cnbc is even legal
i guess tsla just going to burn theta all day
Stupid question, but I am holding a large amount of equity from a former employer that had an IPO after I executed my options. 

I fully intend to hold forever, but at the moment my shares can't even be sold until I move them to a brokerage. Does anyone have a recommendation here? I'm in the US and the shares are with American Stock Transfer & Trust (AST)
Probably the wrong place to ask this kind of question
Yes. You can move that equity directly to my Ameritrade account.
do you like Ameritrade? Are they a good option for people who don't intend to be active traders? Will they fuck me over or are there better options to consider?
It’s ok. It’s better for traders because of the think or swim app.

I think if it’s a large sum of money I would consider fidelity, vanguard or schwab.  I have accounts at the first two
Call a reputable brokerage and I'm sure they'd be happy to help you transfer to get you as a customer. TDA or Fidelity are pretty good
cool, definitely familiar with Fidelity and they seem to be stable.
You are asking a calculus question to a bunch of kindergarteners on the playground.

Because anything they can't understand is a meme
Because Cramer didn't tell them to buy it back when it $20

Down 70% today on intraday calls and puts. If someone did the exact opposite of me today, they’d have made a fortune.
Do you remember Green day’s Mr. Frodo?
PYPL down 0.3% and my frikking Jan 2023 210c leaps down 5.2%. Don’t even know how leaps can react so violently to such minuscule drops 😒😒😒😒
it's called iv
You got cucked by IV
Probably IV
IV.
You buy at 930 on the dot or something?
Yesterday 5 mins before close
It's not IV....it's probably a wide bid/ask spread. You really cant trust option values....at least on TD.
On ETrade and the bid ask spread isn’t that wide. I also thought of that initially.
My zoloft isn't working...suggestions?

Man, I really wanna buy a TSLA put, but theta and IV are lame.
Buy one out 6 months. $TSLA is one stock where way OTM puts are a valid play. $420 a popular number!

Let spy die so next week can be normal for fucks sake

If SPY gets some volume we soaring
Or tanking
Disney day going to be a positive catalyst I hope. Loaded calls today
If PLTR could have a 30% day tomorrow, that’d be swell.
PLTR can’t do 30% in a year
The saddest part is that I know.
dont think thre will be any major movements today because the bond market is closed. We will see tomorrow about Bond yields and whether we keep dumping or consolidate. Go out and do some stuff today and come back to play tomorrow.
Russia invasion warning is designed to spook money into not selling
It’s so much more entertaining when you play TSLA. My account fluctuates 100s of dollars. Now it’s moving like $15 at a time. 🥱
lol both pumps and dumps are fake today
BABA ends day around $175

I don't even know what to buy anymore. Guess i will hold cash.

What other fintech did this? Lol
Affirm and upstart both cratered
Fed and Yellen on monetary and fiscal stimulus:

"We need to pump trillions into the economy to increase demand since it's anemic and needs our help to recover!"

"Actually, demand exceeding supply has nothing to do with anything we've done, it's all supply driven!"

Can't have it both ways.  Kinda ironic that many considered the economy to be overheating PRIOR to covid.  Rate hikes 2015-2019 were well-received generally.  

Apparently though now the problem is not too much money pumped into debt markets, shitco IPOs / spacs, and real estate.  It's that "real" supply hasn't caught up!
Imagine when it does , new ath. We
Lost a year of growth cuz of Covid. If you ask me we are just making up for lost time. Hence pow’s taper.

Is AMD going up or going down? 
I bought call Tuesday, it dropped. I bought puts Wednesday, it goes up.

What about Puts on $RIDE? Earnings is AH and the stock surged today with positive outlook and factory sales. Yet they are not expected good earnings and seems like they never do well on earnings
> I'm not really interested in trading Puts on $RIDE.
RIDE is currently bear sh\*t. Their demo vehicles caught on fire. Only EVs worth mentioning are RIVN TSLA and LCID and LCID's already gone up a lot. If I had a million dollars to throw at an EV right now, it'd be RIVN. They have the room to grow and have a path to do it.
So Puts on Ride
maybe for a pump n dump otherwise I'm not touching it I'd try to get rid of it asap otherwise 🤣
Might be a bad idea. Apple is still looking for an ev company.

Fuck dude just buy January calls and actually ball out
I love it
Silly me for thinking I should hold onto calls that were already past breakeven in a market that only goes up.
And I keep selling them way too early thinking even with a market that only goes up; MY calls will inevitably go down... Of course; not sure if they kept going up cause i sold them soo early or if they would have continued going up had I held onto them...
Is a QQQ ATH close too much to ask??
Spy 466 call 11/15 you will be remembered dearly

I feel like memes are about to explode. Ticking time bomb

How is it that every time I decide to buy calls it’s always at the high of the day? I swear I have it down to a science now. Fuck

SOFI long term hold or take gains?
They still have bank charter at some point. All my calls are for next year so I’m gonna hold a little longer.
No shame in low gains but much regret in no gains!
Should be the MFing slogan.
Easy Hold. They crushed ER with half their student loan $ not coming in till Jan + bank charter on horizon.
I'm at least holding my shares for a little while. They're poised pretty well to continue to diversify and grab more market share, so I don't see why not
Followed WSB wisdom to get in months ago, I will continue to hold then!  At this point my portfolio is like 70% wsb LOL
Smooth brained till the day we die
LCID is trading at a market cap of around 75B, and RIVN is trading at a market cap of about 100B. So is LCID still a buy with the rally still?
I Remember everyone complaining that LCID wasn’t worth 75B because they hadn’t produced any cars, how is RIVN worth that much more?
Rivn shouldnt be worth more imo
Yea, I feel like loading up on lcid could be a good play, especially if rivn sinks.
Hasn't Rivian delivered like 50 cars?

So its worth 50x of LCID, duh
if PTON, CHGG, PENN, ZILLOW, etc can fall 30%+ after earnings $RIDE will fall 50%
Its down > 50 off its peak.
so were all those other stocks
I still think Zillow is a buy. Just sayin'. Once it dusts itself off from the recent BS, it'll rebound hard.
Think I’m about to pull the trigger in SNDL. Volume is insane.
IV is like 520% lmao
Sell CCs, otherwise, not worth it right now, IMO
Must be nice to earn something on stocks. I might be colorblind to green or something.
... been colorblind from a former occupation for \~20 years now. Never been negative yet. So that won't stop you ;)
My calls for Ford are in January and February but it's annoying to see such a slow sell off today
I'm gonna rotate into weed now. Feel like it's time for another circle
It's ripping today, some of my MSOs are up like 15%

Don't think so.  You will see your momey melting slowly every single day
You might be right. The order still has not filled
There at like 0.72 right now. Maybe I should lower the bid to 0.69
Ooof rip wish bag holders
Seriously just dropped those bags and never felt so free
Fucking hell PYPL!!!!! What the hell is this!? Can’t you just catch a break 🤬🤬🤬🤬
It’s just bears playing games, they will have one hell of a time trying to break 200, and they are risking a lot for minimum downside. Shouldn’t even be this low idk why they don’t cover and move on expecting it to drop more is absolutely regarded
Yeah man this shit is way oversold. 6M RSI sitting at 19.1. What the hell.
I didn't sell my RBLX for gains. I thought I'd sell when it hit 1,000 but I forgot it's not TSLA

Waiting for 27 is an opportunity cost , other stocks go up 20% much faster

I do not hear the RIDE gang… are we 🚀🚀🚀 or 👎🔻🔻

You do realize the reason they are up is because they essentially flipped an old production facility while also wholly admitting they will not produce in said facility. I.e. they don’t make anything and will never scale, which is exactly why they are down 80% YTD. Scalp the garbage and get out

How long before SNDL gets delisted if it doesn’t get back to $1?
When the average closing price over any 30 consecutive trading days falls below $1
Uh. It’s way past 30 days my friend
Official Rule:

The criteria for delisting depend on the exchange and which listing requirement needs to be met. For example, on the Nasdaq, the delisting process is set in motion when a company trades for 30 consecutive business days below the minimum bid price or market cap. At this point, Nasdaq's Listing Qualifications Department will send a deficiency notice to the company, informing it that it has 90 calendar days to get up to standard in the case of the market value listing requirement or 180 calendar days if the issue is regarding the minimum bid price listing requirement.

Lost all my fucken money again on the wrong spy options even though I was right on the play. Lessened learned. FUCK
I feel you. I seem to always put a good chunk of $into options a day or 2 before there is a huge sell off.  Did it in September on moderna and then this week on spy, NVIDIA and AMD. At least I have until next week for Nvidia and AMD. Need SPY to go back to $470+ for my 468 calls. I even thought I was being good by paying more for in the money calls and still got screwed
I think the problem is you buy otm options hoping it goes up for that 600% gain
I did that on moderna, but I didn't this week on the 3. Actually bought all in the money options and then everything tanked
If it was the right play then I don’t think you would have lost all your fucken money again??? 🤔
Pretty sure I said I BOUGHT THE WRONG FUCKEN SPY OPTIONS YOU THICK SKULLED FUCK.
I’m gonna let the yelling slide this time because I’m sure you’re upset about losing all of your money. 

How can you buy the wrong options, but it’s still the right play, but you lost all your money? Sounds like the wrong play, buying the wrong options, and losing all your money.
I just don’t want to live anymore dude
Brooooo you alright man? You can always get more money. Only get one life. Stay safe my guy
I wish life was better man
Is it too soon to post a meme of that clip at the Travis Scott concert with Travis dancing on a pedestal while a guy is getting cpr down below and captioning Travis as “Elon musk” and captioning the dead guy as “Tesla bag holders”????

Travis is a fucking no good scumbag rich thug.  I bet he is a real little bitch.

“From there Cramer went up to Wall Street. As he was walking along the street, some gay bears came out of the bodegas and jeered at him. “Get out of here, baldy!” they said. “Get out of here, baldy!” He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of Jerome Powell. Then two bulls came out of the stock exchange and mauled forty-two of the gay bears. And he went on to the NYSE and from there returned to CNBC.”

100% true
Really hate this trend of women all getting fat and a bunch of Simps calling them thicc and saying they look better.

By the time my wish calls print I won't be able to find a girl with a BMI under 30
this is just on the internet, in the real world people are pretty much normal
"bunch of Simpson" lol
asvage. Agree thou. BMI in the US is the worse.
Fat acceptance and fat encouragement/enablement have blurred lines.
30bmi is still obese. under 25 is healthy.
What is VisualMods bmi
I know brah I drove down main street it was honestly gross.
TSLA $1500 EOW bc fuck your puts and Elon is just selling enough stock to exercise his options.

doesn’t last forever, appreciate it while you can valuations will get back to normal in 2022 while Tesla falls 50% Facebook will only fall 10%
I’m balls deep in FB, Tesla has to fall by 99% in order to make it fair value bro. These people living a fantasy
No one wants profit, they want promises.  Even if they are broken later.
stories > profits
No ones cares about profits. It's all about the hype.
TSLA also profitable dude. For at least a year now.
1.6B in revenue for the quarter sir. They are valued at over a TRILLION.

I personally don't know what to say when ppl thank me for my service. Like ummm You're welcome I guess? I did it for free college, money, and job experience. Not because I'm patriotic.
I did a lot less for my money, and behind a Wendys.

So thanks anyways
My roommate and I Re veterans and we used to troll each other by thanking each other for your service in akward situations. It's embarrassing when people say it.

Might sell 1 more then buy back when it dips when he sells more
Yeah I really regret not getting a call or 2 yesterday when I saw Tesla starting to rebound
He hasn't though... he's got a lot left to sell
Looks like SPY is gearing up for a great earnings report
Whenever you see someone here pumping something , look at their comment history. They always have options expiring soon.
I discuss stuff that i hold a position in but im reformed and hold deep itm options/shares so i can afford to hold longer term for the pump to come around like my BBBY 16C, having theta eat into to meme calls is retarded
Who else is buying the nvda dip?? 🚀🚀
added more at 298 and 295 yesterday - i get paid tomorrow and if it's still under 300 i'm buying more -
Yess me too, sounds like free money
Inflation is good for people with debt because it devalues it. (As long as your interest rate isn't variable then you get fucked by rate hikes)
I was just thinking about this. My house payment stays the same and I have a low fixed interest so inflation makes my house payment less.

It also makes my paycheck less.
that why visa run yesterday

Idk, ask them.
Did you rob em?

Get off of Robinhood. They're literally betting against you. When you purchase shares, your buys never even hit the market. They just have IOUs with your name on it. The more money you lose, the more money they make.

**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/miseno3231** bet **SPY** goes from **465.46** to **66666666.0** before **2021-11-12 07:17:57.526110-05:00**
I have a good feeling about this one
Seems pretty likely tbh
Cheers to any Vets on here, thanks for your service!!
SOFI gang check in 👇
Reporting, I made $13k on puts yesterday, sold at close and bought 1k shares and $10k in Leaps. Easy money!
Held on to my 1260 tesla calls like a true degenerate
One day you’re gonna regret this kind of mindset holding onto losing trades hoping it will rebound
Alright been saying this for the past 3 days now and I’ve been getting absolutely fucked but I see you spy please have a Green Day you fucking bitch
Imagine, there are people who don't own big tech.
Well that's becuase big tech owns me now
Warren buffet noises.
Aapl
"own"
0.00000000000000000042069% but that still counts
Gooooood morning my beautiful retards and veteran 🌈🐻 put holders 🥰 I hope your holiday is filled to the brim with fat gains!
If i were Elon i would sell my shares for a massive gain, tank the stock, buy back half the company at $50
He’s working on it
Yeah, but the Sec has rules to prevent this from occurring.  He needs to do a ‘Willie Nelson’.   Sell his stocks, have one of his rich friends use Elon’s money to buy them back, have a side deal that Elon really owns this stock.   Willie Nelson, during his tax crisis, his compadres bought his assets from the IRS for him when they were up for auction.
You forgot that he will buy puts first.  Then do what you said.
Elon is a godlike 4D chess player
Let’s all get high and buy $SOFI 🚀💰🚀💰🚀
We bought calls when we saw them big ol tittys can't wait for open
With you on the first part. 

SOFI is losing money
Will be profitable very soon. Huge growth. In 6 months you’ll be losing money by not investing in $SOFI 💰🚀🚀🚀💰💰🚀💰💰

BULLISH TECH BULL MARKET UNTIL THE END OF TIME 


STAY IN THE MARKET AND GET RICH BOYS!
I don’t understand the concept of “TSLA calls”. How do these even exist? Like… who exactly is selling me these things?
Anyone can sell you call options. Even you can sell options. You just need deep pockets.
Nice, bought yesterday a small amount of PLTR and I am already up almost 4%

When retail pumps pltr to 25 again - time to sell. Rinse repeat
Stock literally just goes from $21 - $27 only.
Yeah but once you embrace it - infinite money printer
Perfect for wheeling
Even chess masters get beat by bots and here we are thinking that we can beat bots...

Renaissance Tech is actually bots-based and that's why they win.

TSLA 8% day and I’m breaking even.

So its gonna be 6%

Anyways the moral of the story is he buys puts everyday 🌈🐻

goddamn psfe 40% haircut.  that shit is going to $1.  SHit has been around for decades - still lose money and cant grow

&#x200B;

Why did I buy that hype
So has Palantir
I rode it from 14 to 30 pltr and jump in/out for swings.  I'll probably buy some when it's 20 and ride it back to 25
Mark it down… PSFE goin back to $7 by next week just saying
Do a ban-bet then mr. confident
Kk
Not by next week, but it’s definitely got a long term future. Excellent dip buying opportunity

They did yesterday
Wtf pullback is over too bad you missed it
Keep going SPY you beautiful beast. PUMP

Triple bottom now on spy, lets light the solids and fucking teleport to ATHs
10yr yield going higher tomorrow when the bond market opens back up and SPY/tech not going to be happy...
Agree. I’m waiting to buy qqq puts until morning because I can just see the initial headline: “market higher despite rise in 10 year.”  And then hopefully I time the puts just right. I’m so sick of a headline like that when I feel like I did the right thing the day before.
My portfolio is fucking cocked locked and ready for 10yr rise. Cant wait to see it rise and my portfolio to somehow end up red anyways.
I hope the market actually makes some sense soon and we can make some money!!

You know it
ROOT still going up!
Root calls up 200% only regret not buying more.  And no I'm not selling...yet 😂
Cmon Mickey you dumb rat fucking rip back to yesterday’s price already
It'll be a few week/months before we see $170. $155 is much more likely in the short term.
The SPY daily sure looks like the start of a bull flag.
Exactly the point I made earlier. These December 1st expiration SPY calls are going to make me a pretty penny.
Might wait until tomorrow to load up tbh, still feels like it could crater any second..
I really hope SNDL flies because I have about 50k shares with covered calls that I would love to have assigned away at 1
I’ve been unbanned. God bless the mods!

wtf is this post?
Like if you hate risk so much that you're placing stop-losses, maybe invest in boomer funds instead? Either your investment horizon is too short, or you're investing in the wrong shit. You're literally just going to lose money because they hunt you, take your shit, plunder your butthole, and then pump that shit right back up. Congrats fa**ots, you've been pumped and dumped lol

Or he will find them and grow up thinking you're a pervert.
If COIN hits 290 tomorrow, I’ll shove 13 ice cubes up my ass.
Imagine being a PayPal bear and thinking those of us who loaded up on leap calls won’t just fookin do it again if it drops another leg down 🐻 ===> 🤡
PYPL and BABA leaps are most viable path right now. Lets see how those plays go..
Part of the ship part of the crew baby
I feel the same way but for PLTR. God speed retard
Palantir will absolutely do well over time but IMO it’s a share only type of move. That stock will be incredibly hard to time but when it has breakthrough or makes moves it will move up fast. That’s the kind of stock like sofi that you buy shares of and hold for ten years
Whoopass’s company actually makes money tho

Holy shit. Why do you think it's been tanking? I may have to add LEAPS as well.

You either cum in the sink or sink in the cum
None of us would be here with out cum.
And to think that all of us degenerates were at one time, the strongest, fastest and smartest to hit the target successfully while millions failed.
People who bought puts yesterday need to realize that inflation is already priced in. This is not news and no one actually believes it’s transitory since inflation feeds on itself. Buy calls and ride the wave so you’ll be able to afford that $10 banana.

*Wendy’s, we salute you*
SPCE, BNTX and DASH messed with my head this earnings season. Shook me out of UPST puts and made me too worried to pull trigger on BYND puts. I’m up 5k on the month, but…GUH. How the hell do you guys stay convicted and power through after some solid losses??
I smoke enough weed that I forget.  Then repeat infinitely.
By thinking of it as just numbers on a screen and not emotionally attached. Of course only what you can afford to lose too
Got it - I don’t think anyone has ever said it that bluntly but makes sense. I need to set some risk parameters to stick to as well I think and not waiver from that
Best way to keep your money
Yeah hard to fight the urge to chase stuff but not gonna FOMO. Id like to compound on my 5k month…not burn it all away 😂
It is hard and it sux sometimes thinking you would have made a bunch more, but stops have saved my ass more often then not.
Autism.
Grow numb to the pain.

&#x200B;

Start doing your own DD.  If it doesn't work, own the loss and learn from it.  Refine your DD process to include what was missed previously.

Maybe 25. Just surviving earnings this quarter without a big dump is a win
Qualcomm gonna roar back to ATHs today. Paper hands selling yesterday will be pissed.
Gymnopedie No. 1 by Erik Satie honestly goes so hard
All this time still balls deep in SOFI
Didn’t buy calls yesterday do I buy them at open?
Always fomo into positions
Absolutely.   One of the best decisions you could ever make.
Hold off a little and see what the market is doing later today. Might get a better entry than at open. Or not…
Green pre-market across the board....except for Disney. Feelsbad man
As a DIS put holder, feelsgood man
Bummer.
I put a buy in for Disney at $150 just for the hell of it several months ago. If that thing triggers, I will be shocked. Even at $164 it’s likely a bargain, but I promised myself I’d not, under any circumstance change my limit buys. 

So, I’ll probably change my limit buy.
Got puts as a hedge, dumb for not just getting more calls tbh
Same here with dis but vice versa, 20 calls and only 6 puts 🤡
What made you bullish? I was about to do the same thing when I saw this?
Fuck you PSFE ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
So glad I don’t have to check the market today. No positions expire til next Friday. Feels good. Will watch the market rabidly anyway.
High inflation priced in bois. Surprises move the market and this was no surprise anymore.
Can’t wait for TSLA 1250 so I can buy more 1000p
Wait, so we’re bullish today?
Rivian is carrying the market
I’m bullish every day. You really shouldn’t listen to the bears here. Most of them have brain damage.
The more you guys buy PSFE the more it goes down

Where do you think this is going? Lmao it literally won't got higher than 471 that is the ceiling. It could break out if that but has shown zero intention of doing so
Damn, how bad did PSFE miss?
It's less about how much it missed and more about how bad the future looks. Even the company isn't denying it.
Glad I don't hold much
I sold. I couldn't take any more pain and it looks like more than a year before it has a chance to recover.
It sounds like they think they're fucked.
Think about it. With inflation coming in a lot higher than expected where else can you store your money

Whats good for SPY was the selling. Way too much selling the past two days to pump. Maybe everybody cleared their shitty positions
If Vix drops I think I might buy a few calls expiring 8th Dec in case the market throws a mini shit-fit about the debt ceiling. Aside from that I cant think of any other negative catalysts between now and EOY. Not overly worried about the next CPI report, Rivian may have had as much to do yesterdays bloodbath as CPI. I like to think about this type of shit. It makes me feel like less of a gambler.
Do I sell my SPY call at open?  Or wait and let the market either reward me further or screw me?
Just do the usual
You mean pass on 15% gains so I can hold until it’s -90%?
Of course, why do you even ask?
Sell
Open. The. Casino.
Yo what the FUCK Paysafe..
It does what it does best. Drops 😂… kidding aside, my position looks rather bad now 💩
Rivian calls when lmao
I think 🕵️‍♂️ will still trend down today and tomorrow, but hey, I'm just a 🤡.
Even though I was routed yesterday, dropping 6%, I’m still up 4% on the week. Always have to zoom out to gain perspective
I'm down 75% All-time. I'm gonna go ahead and zoom back in.
Holy fuck. I hope you are joking.

really think we don't have rising inflation here as well?

dollar is rising compared to?
It depends on how much we are printing relative to other nations

Let the dump commence!
Puts been printing all week and I pick the one play that moons to be a 🌈🐻. My luck is trash.
Plug is doing that thing again
>Need more.
So 9:55 - 10:00 AM was a bull trap? 🤔
Where the fuck JPOW

leave of absence!!

Who the fuck approved it
The only bull move I could think of is buy more PYPL. and add a BABA leap. what else can i do?
Penn gonna pop on Portnoy 2pm news?
DIS calls on this dip seems like the way.. cashed out my puts for a decent profit but historically DIS has eaten up every large dip fairly quickly
Seems to be a gap that needs to be filled.
so does your mom
Quick and easy 30% scalping SPCE calls this morning. Needed a decent day trade so bad
WISH IV crush -- underlying up, short term option premiums down
this market sucks
CRSR calls going ham
Guess I’ll just buy spreads ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
China having another fine day on Wall Street e.g. JD +6%
I like to do a little fake business..
DIS March calls are half off today and today only. Go visit the mouse and get yours today
Duck the guy who talked up Paysafe awhile back. Don’t think I need to worry about my CC getting called away this week….

This price action is all over the place
LCID made me a lot of money so far.  Spooked a bit.
Earnings next week. It's run up a ton so it's going to need a solid report to hold where it's at, you may want to lock in some profits
The exact second I sell Amd it pops after
F
LOL my stop loss was literally bottom of the hour so far. 

Nice. Awesome. Chill. Dope. Tight
What's a stop loss
I wish i had this mindstate. They’re back up to break even now
Scared money don't make money
Tendyman feeding me off my SPY calls
Should I put $500 into 1dte SNDL .50 puts 🤔
Anyone buying wish puts?
of course, f Wish
Anyone in PYPL for a day trade? Thinking 205+ today. Venmo and AMZN big deal.
I'm ddeep as fuck in leaps
Oh fuck a 6/22 250c cheap as fuck
wish making amc look juicy

wake me up when the VIX goes green
FSR so horny rn
Read the PSFE report, I guess I’ll buy the dip. Could be worse I reckon
So what’s the story on this
Guidance cut for Fiscal Year 2021, but they gave their reasoning as to why and it was complications with the wallet. I’m going shares not options. I’m willing to hold for a decent time
EV stonks are going bananas today...LCID, NIO and even HLYN is getting in on the action
Even SOLO lmao
FSR 🥵
What is everyone's 1 year target price for Ford $F?
Somewhere between $15 and $23/share
That doesn’t bode well for my calls
$5
Why did WISH pop today?
Maybe some people liked their earnings and Q4 outlook? Or maybe because it's 11:11 on 11/11
Curious how people feel about BMBL prospects.  Cuffing season is coming up and this 15% dip may be providing an entry point.  Any bullish/bearish reasons to buy/stay away?
It's a money loser
That’s my main fear.  If their user base can’t increase at a rate to compensate for that then it could be a real trap.
It's IPO price. I'd wait
Oh yea I forgot how it was so much higher than the original ipo price.  That’s what kept me away then
Bumble seems like a great company and app, but they also have a lower priced Badoo app which indirectly competes with their main app. 

I would go long, as the future is online dating, but badoo is garbage.
I definitely agree with the online dating sentiment.  The apps with the best branding should win out in my mind.  I wonder if selling badoo could be in their future
CRSR doing that thing it does 1-2x per quarter.
bmbl calls are free money. unless they aren’t.
Fuller go easy on the Pepsi
FULLER
I need Bill Hwang to tell me AMD is gonna moon from here on.
Why is CRSR popping off on high volume?
idk retard maybe cause it’s undervalued?
Very cool Visa, dip below $200 please
Damn what’s wrong with dkng
I’m ready to back the fake dentist SDC pump around the corner!
Good job PLUG gang!!! Keep pushing…
I love seeing posts like “who’s selling at x price?”. I think some of you really only buy the top
if the market make sense we will all be very rich
V is just as much of shit as PYPL.
At least V is the one who issues the cards coinbase and others are using lol 😂
Just thinking the same thing lol
I’m up on $LCID wtf do I do? Sell, hold, buy something else? Buy some more?!! I do not have a clue what I am doing
Seriously tell me what to do!! And is $500 to low to be making any realistic gains? I have PTSD from shipping AMC and GME and TSLA last year I AM PARALYSED WITH INVESTMENT FEAR
Used $600 to make $30k on nvidia calls last week in one day
I’m srsly not cut out for this

To those manipulating the market: If we dont get a really fat pump today please if we can have one tomorrow to go into the weekend with i wanna eat kobe beef all weekend not wendys
My best play this year was the one where I did more research than the analysts.
SAVA dip is getting eaten up! Won’t be under 100 forever 🚀
I sold my calls for you
$MU poppin today boys!
PYPL almost back to 200. I held this for a long time. Got shares called at around 280 I think. I'm glad they got called. I would have been crying today.
Perfect entry!
Yeep PYPL is a household name. It's not going to stay down forever.

Weed sector sure as hell looks like it has bottomed out.  MSOs have the absolute best earnings growth potential out of any investment out there.
Something that happens near the end of an equity bull market that’s run for 10+ years is that people’s credulity goes to insane levels. People who wouldn’t have touched stocks ten years ago will now completely believe in any story attached to a rising asset price and anyone who questions it is old and out of touch. A tale as old as time

Sticky?
Probably not a 10%+ correction until next year. Or if Powell admits that inflation is a REAL problem at the December meeting. (Ain’t it crazy that everyone knows it’s a problem but they just want to pump the markets?!)
NVDA pinned at VWAP tells me that this is 100% algos on full auto.
They need to turn the fuck off
They wanna stop the bleeding on weeklies. Next week I think will be moonshot.
Hopefully Bc that’s when my contracts expire 🤣

I know as soon as I paper hands these QQQ calls it will fly. But it cannot break 392 today.
I’m wondering if the ten year will actually start moving up soon. Might now get this santa rally. Maybe already had it???  F, wish I knew.
BRB tying a cinder block around Tesla’s ankles real quit to solve this issue we are having

Literally the only prediction I will be right at today!
Bless your soul fellow retard
Still some selling to be had. Looking at 1085
Imagine thinking SPY was going to break $467 today
Turned off fast money. Enough about DIS!!!!
omg I just saw a huge demon cock appear out of nowhere   :O
Is Rivian a good buy still?
If you believe in the stock that it will go up like TSLA in the future
When is this Reddit IPO coming out
Oh man. This game is getting expensive.
This $464.3 support is unreal lol
NEGG could see $100
If it happens on WeBull it doesn’t count
What happens on WeBull stays on WeBull
Only good thing I did this week was buy these Disney calls.
what lil tech gains are evaporating
#SHREKS DICK HAS ENTERED THE CHAT
volume today is comical, guess we going for 4 straight red days tomorrow
Action on GME sure is moving slow

Not nearly as much as Stephen “shit stain” Weiss though
Stock starts shooting up. Opens depth chart. 

Oh fuck yeah, those are numbers alright
If lazr can get back above 20.60 and finish there we are going on a fucking ride.
I bet it crashes after earnings
I don't know I placed calls for tmmr. They had a deal with NVidia on Monday I believe
Yeah but that won’t affect these earnings
If a contract was signed they can release the numbers after trading hours. Like door dash revealed they're buying a 7 billion dollar company after hours
I hope you’re right because I have calls (which is why I think it will crash) I also have blnk calls
I haven't heard of BLNK might look into it rn before closing
They have earnings AH
Hm ok ok I think i'll sit it out and see how it performs
Probably a good idea.. my luck has been horrible lately
I had two great calls with 2000% gains total with small 100 and 200 dollar calls and one that sucked me dry
SPY just execute the order
Is there a reason why some people can repost meme after meme, but I can't upload my own without being offensive or anything?

Seems like the bar for this sub changes like the stock market.
Looks like pltr is just going to inverse the market today
....and another red day.
Dash is basically that trump poster with his face on Rambo.
pretty funny seeing the WISH bagholders have hope this morning.
WOW WISH TO THE MOON!!!!!!!! drops fuckin 12% from when they bought calls and freefalling as we speak

You guys sleeping on Riot Blockchain, they're having earnings next week hop onto the ride fellas.
This post is one year too late
black friday stock market crash too obvious right?
> I think so.
No
queue up the black friday sale X stock at X% discount memes
NEGG, go back to bed
NVDA is gonna get pinned at 300 till friday to kill premium isnt it
Going to get pinned at 300 until earnings.
then dump like all growth after earnings?
Yep. It's gone up 50% in a month. It's going to see a reduction even with a good earnings. And if its earnings are bad it's going to 250 or below.
The moment I sell all my PLTR shares out of anger and frustration, it will uptrend.
Plz sell
That is true for every stock except PLTR, you’ll be fine
why doesn't PLTR ever hold its price
I mean if you want my honest answer, its over glorified and way over valued. It’s also just a printing machine for shares through SBC. Executives and insiders win while retail is stuck holding the bag.
how is their SBC different than any FANG company

what should they be trading at 14-18?
Massively different, I’d suggest you look into it as its a bit too technical to type out on a comment on my phone. Exactly though, I believe fair value rn is about $18
I'll look into it...right off the bat though I wouldn't imagine they would mess up their stock any worse than other big silicon valley tech companies.
CNBC headline EOD market is gay and couldn’t hold gains.

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Milk_n_Serial (1/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 900.0 when it was 1052.2 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Next leg up will be from PYPL 🚀🚀
QS and LCID are just retardant stocks lol
RIDE making a decent run up to ER

It’s printing nice 😂🥃 so far so good ⬆️⬆️⬆️

that might pay off. When did you get them?
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/StopTheBan420 (2/4) made a bet that FB would go to 350.0 when it was 333.845 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Stop the ban!
Dear QQQ & SPY,  


Just close green today and we gucci. We'll get em next week
ok retards, what's the PUT play today at close?
AZN
RIDE or LAZR
I have puts on BLNK. Wish I would have waited, but you live and you learn. Or live, at least. They're having a huge run up right now on the infrastructure bill, so I think some people are going to be disappointed by their earnings, no matter how close they are to expectations.
RIDE to $10 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Why is 🍏 such trash
Give it time. When all the other meme bullshit falls Apple will keep steadily going up.
I am running out of patience. YTD it hasn’t moved 5 % on average 🤦‍♂️😂
Zoom out a couple years. AAPL the kind of company you hold for decades, not weeks or months.
It was at $56 in 2019. It has tripled. But profits have not. It’s expensive.
So many companies are much worse. At least aapl is leading the market in phones
Yeah, I agree with that but it’s so big already that it’s growth rate is slower now. Who knows, man. Not me.
Yeah I am not disagreeing with you. It’s just frustrating
What’s the grossest ugliest stock on the market? Go!
CLOV no doubt.

big money keeping it down every session to pump AH and sell at open to buy in lower, every day this week maybe monday breaks the pattern for earnings
I just semi-YOLOed into KHC because I was hungry and it's ticker reminded me of KFC.
Can I offer you ELY/Topgolf off of record revenue earnings and multiple price target upgrades up to $60?
$ELY is crazy cheap!

Super bullish on $ELY. TopGolf is the shit!
Yea i think theres a boomer messing with it the past couple days after earnings hopefully next week it takes off
There was a hiccup in Vietnam supply chain I believe. Everyone wants a Callaway driver for Christmas and a trip to top golf. $ELY looks like a buy
$ROOT up 30%!

The math checks out on this one, boys
In paysafe at 4.19. Either I made a mistake or I’ll make $10
It’s a bad day when on PLTR has made you money …
Where’s all the volume it’s dead out here
$ROOT
It’s Veterans Day, bond market is closed, so low volume on stock market as well
$ROOT
It’s in EV stocks
Anyone holding through BLNK earnings? feel like the pump is related to monday bull signature and not on optimistic earnings
Spy green, my calls red
Plug and FCEL are alive and kicking again lads and ladies!!
amzn go uppies plz 🥺

Back in the day, being sued by the country tanked a stock, now it’s just a light dip?
We live in a world where a major lawsuit today is tomorrow’s old news. We had a president who was orange and now we switched him out with a guy with dementia. We also trade fake coins mined on the internet. The world is on its head. Your puts won’t print gay bear 🐻
Hang on I’m no bear. I’ve been on the bull wave for years. 
I just saw I good opportunity to make some money back after my AMD calls bent me over yesterday
Yes but we all know puts rarely print with JPOW running this ship. Also the entire world could be burning and people wouldn’t care about it. We live in a wild word dude
RIDE broke $7!! This will moon to double difits
Any weight on the ROOT ,TSLA collab
$RIDE going up on news released in October when the stock was $5 and didn't react to it. Clown market

Guys what are we thinking for BLINK earnings? Calls are fun but puts print..
Root volume doubles and goes up 30%? If your shorting this your fucked , sooo fucked
I dont know what to play
If PSFE didn’t declare bankruptcy it is probably a good entry point.
I bought some Jan calls hoping for a turnaround
Come on CAT what you doin to me
Oh yeah keep going EXFY! I’m almost there!
PSFE seems like a good buy at this price
The mouse will be ok once mando releases
EGLX!! (TSX) Let’s fucking go!!!
....and still FSR is only $6.5B????...and 30% short retards...will be $20B after next Wednesday, the Ocean reveal at the Auto Show.
Let’s hope. I’ve been holding since it went pubic. Cost of $15 but I need bigger gains for the time I’ve been holding.
HYLN said fuck your downgrades
Anyone else here feels like market is going crazy? Like crazier than January last year? Everything related to ev is mooning even shitty companies like NKLA. I feel that there were so many easy plays and easy money to make and I missed on all of them. Could have just put all my money on FSR or LEV or PLUG and made bank. Instead, I decided to lose money on MRNA. Fml

Weed calls for next week. Think it’s a safe play even with market volatility. Weed stocks / ETFs have hit a bottom recently and momentum is definitely picking up. Only positive news.
As soon as I open a put credit spread, Starbuck begins to fall. you fucking piece of shit!
BBBY is the Becky play man
Naw, I only open spread on blue-chip stocks. They are printer. Starbuck still gonna give me $90 in two weeks, I just hate seeing negative in my portfolio
Again BBBY, they have as much cash onhand as their entire float. Starbux is overpriced and BBBY is underpriced with 60% short interest and a CEO buying back the entire float. 

You do you but I mean it's an ez call
I would do BBBY, but I'm not too familiar with them. Only been trading for 5 months so I'm still learning shit tons of stuff. Sticking to what I know for now, but BBBY is added to my watch list tho.
Doesn’t even feel like the market is open today
nice PAYSAFE CALLS LADS
Bought leaps
I’m eatin ass over here
What to do, fellow Wishtards? Hold or sell?
Wow ATVI is actually green
There were some big buy orders earlier
bout time
Deff. I have 46 67.5c 12/17
Nobody likes BYND or what. I guess I should buy it now
They missed 8 consecutive earnings. Sure go ahead buy it 😂
Most vegans/vegetarians don’t want to eat fake meat because even the idea of eating meat grosses them out.

Non-vegans will always prefer the real thing. They’ll try the fake version once for novelty and never touch it again.

There’s just not much of a market out there for the product.
I know product doesn't really matter anymore but I found it to be a hard sell. I'd rather just eat better meat less frequently and eat more veg than eat a bunch of simulated meat that was okay but not great.
BBY calls finally green again
If Ford hits $25 by January next year I'm gonna cop the Mustang-e

Shout out to whoever mentioned Super League on here... up 17% today

Paysafe is gonna maybe be a little better tomorrow, idk.
I’m in for 400, I’d expect some sort of correction. Too big of a swing
The bond market is closed and meme stocks are up
Bring back the smooth lines SPY!
Considering jumping in on this 12/31 500c play. I dunno though. Maybe 490 would be better. 

The biggest thing working against this play in my mind is that u/AxemanFromMA thinks it’s smart and everything he touches expires worthless
https://ibb.co/dBqtBwt

🤡
Yes, that is a chart, well done
Yeah, I want to jump in with the 465 11/26 but his confidence makes me really uneasy.
I think SPY has cleansed itself of that crash. People really shouldnt be doing too much more selling and it seems people are buying in at this price level now

Bought January $RIDE $7.5 puts for earnings
Oh yes TSLA do it
Joe Terranova sold Netflix 20 points lower from here two days ago. Was on fast money talking with such confidence he had it figured out.
Imagine being named after a shitty SyFy channel show that only lasted 2 seasons
Leaps on BA?
never a bad play
PYPL floor is at $200, it has held this support for days now, including yesterday’s intense selling pressure.  If it didn’t go below $200 then, it’s not going below it at all.  Load up!
I agree.  I sold my 201 buy at 207, but got back in to hold long at 202.5
Do not sell your shares cheap, buy this and hold with full confidence.  I have $25,000 in it now.
Yeah kinda think so too but ...

The real problem is... PYPL may be a tax loss candidate in December.

I'd stay away until Jan... can make money elsewhere.
Someone buy my pfe 11/12 61$ for 1$ I need it for some Wendy’s frosty

Alcoholic cocaine addict in skinny jeans making bad decisions?

Who could have possibly seen this happening?!
as an alcoholic cocaine addict in skinny jeans I can assure you that you are correct
Almost all the stocks IPOed last year tanked after earnings
I got inspired by the PSFE dip and bought OTLY 5P 😂😂😂 potential 9000% gain
Noice bounce back hopefully it will continue into tomorrow!
Since earnings are pure gamble, I bought puts for tomorrows astra zenaca's earning report.
why not just play a straddle lol
Hey usa. Why even open if you going to be all slow like this
My portfolio A shaped recovery.
The morning pump to all day fade is worse than just tanking outright and you can’t convince me otherwise.
People really trust a Chinese brokerage with their life savings? Lmao
> Yes.
IWM needs life support
Huh?  It’s up 1% today….
Im still red on my calls. I need like 243 at this point
Chart still looks super bullish after a whole year of consolidation
lol this portnoy press conference... but also, like, wow, thank god for receipts.
LOL DKNG you had me there for a second
I'm long NVDA calls.  How does that run still have life left in it but I think it does.  Joy to the future of tech.
What options exactly are people buying with SNDL????
Calls, no thesis or likeness just gamba #earningsszn
But what strikes?  Seems retarded when a share is 70 cents
It is retarded if you’re anticipating a 30% run up. It will only print on a 50-100% run which is what i’m betting on(over a few days). They are FD plays, but I also have a .50 strike as a hedge. Shares are definitely the better play if you think they will beat
The aren't. Why buy options on a gd penny stock
Then why is iv 500%
yolo nov 19th $1 calls because I hate money. Also 1/22 $1 calls because I believe it has potential to reach that target by then. 

These all make up a very small amount of my portfolio though. Just doing it in the slight chance they post good earnings. But every single earnings has always sold off, which should be the expectation going into this one too.
Semiconductors (except INTC lmao) dancing today while rest of the market bleeds the fuck out
All on pretty low volume.
Yes hello, I would like a venti green latte with three extra pumps of QQQ please.
Come on daddy Elon, pump for bloody gay bear assholes
Stay back, WISH bag holder is coming through! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Wish? Don’t you mean PSFE bagholders with 13+ cost averages? Lol
Cute! after buying all the dips, Still -24% down
You aren’t -50% plus? Nice. You’re kind of winning?
If I was winning then I'm at wrong place here
I hope things get better. Need to figure out if the time cost is worth holding and hoping for a rebound or just selling and putting the money in AMD or SPY or something. Good luck man. Good luck.
PFSE will he 50 next year
Yeah. Dreams are nice, aren’t they?
Got some Disney fd calls.  Come on buddy!
Bond market is going to take such a dump tomorrow
Why do I even look at my portfolio, it never brings me joy?
THETA THETA THETA
Your honor I am not a grapist
A huge bullish bet just hit my screen... GME $300c 12/17 exp... whoever you are please don't forget to post your loss porn
Some real dog shit after hours so everything will probably moon
I hope my limit order fills :) this part is always fun
So I should of kept my amd 11/12 150c after all instead of selling for a 80% loss yesterday. 

Fuck you bears.
I’m still down…
Big tech dumping
This market feels like watching someone fall in slow motion
Fuck it I’m gonna pull a boomer yolo buy a few DIS leaps
Make up your mind SPY!
I was promised telsa crash i would like to see elons manager

Probably because you’re staring at them 🧐
Probably thinking about putting their cock on your face
No but you look like a dick tho

Hate flat days man.
TFW volume is so low you’d actually prefer your stock to close red

that's a lot of dmg
Time to buy DIS calls. Let's go!
Did you guys grab more SOFI ?
Is anyone watching the USD index lmao
Algorithms are.
So many indicators firing off, it's crazy. Shame the bond market is closed today.
Is it entertaining watching?
Breaking through a big resistance if my crayons are to be trusted… makes me wanna buy puts on SPY but nothing makes sense anymore
Live Nation is facing billions in lawsuits. Why won't this thing crater to the 100s already.
Fucking profitable company. I missed the entry point of a lifetime in 2020

I am short on this simply for TA reason, the gap are being filled slowly

Holy fuck this is lame
Just close at a perfect 0.0
Anybody playing NVDA for earnings?
I would love to say calls, but I’m literally 1 for 9 in my last earnings calls plays, so feel free to inverse me
Yes, 320c for 11/26. Had a 275c for earnings but rolled up
No more earnings plays for me. I’ve had enough
What day is it
17th
no bc last time it did well it tanked on good earnings
Bought NVDA @ $302 for earnings play
whats the play? I thought they didnt get the meta deal and the earrnings would under perform. But I guess with how things are itll moon.
What day is earnings
Google is a thing you know

Jus bought DKNG $45 1/21 Calls  LFG!
Nice.  This dip has ran too long
I find it interesting that Hulu Live wouldn’t play FBN or CNBC on the same day that DIS reported abysmal earnings. 🤫
What’s with this sideways shit… just drop already
Todays veterans day thats why
Prolly flat till close, flat tomm. And consolidation till after Turkey Day.

Boring but more then likely true
There’s literally no volume. Once algos start up tomorrow with bonds trading again everything will probably drop

Ride puts and calls!
Cash gang
There should be a filter that shows stocks that mooned/dumped most in the last 30-60 minutes.
anyone playing RIDE or BLNK earnings?
RIDE puts. But it'll probably explode on the Foxconn deal.
RIDE 11/19 6p. We shall see. I’ve taken to making very small bets on earnings to observe and learn. For instance I had $6 puts on WISH that were up 50% or more at marker close, and puts on CLOV that we up prior to market close Monday, and now puts on RIDE that are printing. What I’m learning is buy those shots the day before earnings then unload day of
Bought a bunch of 165 11/19 $DIS calls. May the mouse bless me
If I was Xi, I'd buy TSM puts before attacking Taiwan.
I feel like people don’t understand the degree to which China is probably never going to fucking attack Taiwan
Am i a retard for holding BBBY calls overnight?
Are you gunna?

Headquartering your business out Cabo is fantastic. Highly recommend to you retards if you can ever get square on your margin debt.
Boring day. Let's get some volatility up in here tomorrow & OpEx next week
I am beyond disappointed in the market today
That damn Mickey Mouse just likes to FUQQ 🤣
Hedged my CHWY calls with puts today and it worked pretty well.  Sold the puts end of day for a 20% gain and made up for 70% of the loss on my calls
Someone really wants AMZN above 3470
my coworker is talking to me and I literally have not heard a single word they just said. even now as I type. ... it's fuckin 8am bro
Guys, make sure you buy TSLA so Lorde Edge can dump millions of shares at the best possible price. I’d hate to see him go broke
Lmao exactly. Poor guy needs to exit without losing too many of his billions.
To hell with the bottom 99.99999999%
🧂🌈🐻🤡
GME's about to rip to 250 again I feel it in my balls
Stop telling me to buy shit that's up 30% or 40% today, I missed the boat fuck off. Gimme a play that hasn't gone up stupid amounts
SPY $465c 23/12 get in for the xmas rally
$FUBO

TSLA is done for boys and girls, bring on the downvotes
I bought calls for tomorrow just now.  I think its gonna rip
We shall see, one of us will be in the Wendy's dumpster for sure
holding onto my 1050P for 11/12 oooooffff
this inflation is not that bad... it's tepid.. i am currently living (and have lived) in countries where normal inflation is 15-30% - where the prices on menus in restaurants are written in wax pencil so they can change them daily.  These are countries where the gov only hurts the situation.  The FED has so many tools and capabilities to manage inflation. If you look at the data, the majority of the CPI is tied to fuel costs.  Both direct fuel for autos, and it's trickle down effects on the rest of the economy.       


I'm in the oil/gas business,  and like it or not, higher fuel prices mean more jobs, and not just directly in the industry.  It trickles down to large purchases and even real estate.        


What i don't get is why republicans bitch about higher gas costs when they are the ones keeping the oil industry pumping by diminishing climate change and pushing against clean energy.      

Guess it's just something to make biden look bad
Nobody trying to make Biden look bad he does it well enough already
Mods BAN for POLITICAL BULLSHIT
Un-ironic take.
I hope yr enjoying gas prices being $3.50 to $5.  We don’t live in fucking other countries we live here in the USA so what do I care about other countries inflation stats. This isn’t a political issue. Higher Gas prices Affect thousands of businesses. Price of supplies go up because of transportation costs To get product to the end-user. You know that so who are you kidding? This is just a chance for you to get in a political dig. Keep politics out of here bud.
$5 each gallon, real estate double, purchase +20% here. I think it doesn't work here.
This is such a shit take for someone "working in the oil and gas industry".
God bless the veterans
God bless America
God Bless you
God bless all of you!
I love yall mf strangers hands down best community! 🙌🏽 even the 🏳️‍🌈🐻 need a little love

Good for my Jan 2k calls. Not good for my Dec 580 and 600 puts. Let’s go Elon dump your shit before my expiry. Then buy back again by end of Jan.
Bye bye, miss American SPY. Get your puts for Friday now if you haven't already.
I tried to read the second sentence to the tune of “drive your Chevy to the levy” and it made my brain hurt.

Would be stoked, will not count on it.
China is up 2%. It's going to be solid green today.

Can we get a PLTR rebound?
Fuck no. Worst company ever. Trades sideways for a year then plummets on good earnings? Primarily because no one has a bench mark for them because no one knows what they do.
Something about big data

No go back to bed

Yes its open

Come on. Who the fuck is buying WISH? They literally said it gets worse from here and retards still buy the shit. Jesus Christ.
Anyone who ever used Wish in the past should have known it was a garbage company.

My daughter tried to get me to buy something there a couple years ago and I was like "No, kiddo, this is fake Chinese garbage".
Exactly. Its like all the fake Chinese shit on Amazon, except the entire site is like that. Its American to let it die.
No, you can't let a business die! It's basically a person.
Was thinking of buying PSFE, but then had to drive my gf to work. I guess I dodged a bullet. Buy the dip?
Honestly I’m trying to find out when their dip ends
Probably not today. It's most likely going to crater more today. I'd wait a few days to see if it finds a bottom.
#Everyone is dumb but at least we know one thing for sure: stocks going up today
This comment is disputed.
Hard not to like Anthony Noto from SOFI

You mean hedge funds are dumping their bonds for stocks?
Thoughts on 468 today?
Hell yea bro 🇺🇸🇺🇸

Buy AMC
If you aint buyin the disney dip you hate money
Not gonna lie guys, my puts aren't doing great, and being a bear kinda sucks, I might switch back to being a bull again.
wait for the top
Yo PaySafe doesn’t seem very safe
You safely pay them.
Tsla has already broken down the $1k buy wall yesterday, if it goes anywhere near 1k expect 950 nearly instantly
Apparently Elon sold more stock the day before yesterday? I have a feeling we’re not done with this massacre…. Not to mention regular people who have stock and aren’t tuned in like we are move 2-5 days slower than we do.
> I have a feeling we’re going to see the bottom in the next few days.
You are a bot and this was an automated response, chill
I learned my lesson… I grabbed a put on Monday, thought oh shit it’s just gonna go up, but it took like 1-2 days to see the effects. And that’s when we saw that blood red Tuesday
We’re aren’t done - stocks seems to want to go lower but it’s probably artificially pumped to limit the immediate impact of the sales.
It’s holiday season and I just don’t know if people are gonna risk losing all those gains they saw this last month. It’s gonna be a selling frenzy…
Fair point. But Tesla defies gravity so you never know… however, Elon selling is new - only happened once a long time ago
Defies gravity sounds like a bubble to me… 😥
I sold that out too at a loss….
imagine buying puts at the bottom
I swung some yesterday during the dump, but I knew that they were wildly overpriced and people who bought them will get DICKED when this action kicks the other way (it always does).
It's like playing hot potato with volatility, not for the faint of heart
Thanks for the cheap TSLA puts yesterday

Why’s no one talking bout sofi being up nearly 20% lol?
Probably  because we all know what comes after pumps like that
More pumps?
They beat earnings so it's not like there isn't a reason.
Likely (but hopefully not) being kept out of reaching $25 w contracts expiring tomorrow.
It's gunna flyyyy
It's a sleeper.
Because it's being talked about yesterday already?
Lucid and Rivian through the roof. All day
Guys Elon only sold 5 Billion. Its not going up a lot today. Hes still got 15 Billion left. Let it drop and we can get cheap shares.
"Cheap"
Let it drop so i make back a year of losses

Moderna admits significantly higher risk of myocarditis compared to Pfizer/Biontech. Of course BNTX reacts by going red 😐
*in young men. Also says it has less breakout cases, better protection from Covid than BioNTech vaccine.
*overall. I don’t see the data that supports this better protection. BNTX was more careful- advancing the one of their 4 vaccine candidates that offered the best efficacy/safety combo

I bought a TSLA put for 880 by next Friday, I know positively it won't happen...so why did I do it 🤡
[deleted]
Still no chance lol, if it tanks a bit beforehand and I can get even a slim profit I'm jumping ship
[deleted]
Stop getting my hopes up lmao
This is very funny to me.
Shouldnt $F be jacked up to tits with Rivian doing well?
Profit taking. Ford had a 30% run up prior rivian ipo. Buy the rumour sell the news remember 😉
figured
selling TSLA calls is literally free money
Until the stock craters back to $800
That would make him even more money
If they’re covered calls, he would need to hold 100 shares of TSLA. Yea he gets premium but if the underlying went to $800 that’s a -25% loss. So is he selling naked calls? In that case yes, free money while Elon continues to sell
do you think I would hold shares of this garbage company lmao
Oh I'm sure they are naked, just like the naked calls I've been selling on GME lol
Playing with fire with that upcoming LRC partnership lol, what platform do you sell naked calls on?
> I am not a person or entity. I cannot sell anything, nor do I have any control over the price of LRC.
buying TSLA calls is also free money
not anymore ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
what calls did you sell? and how long are you planning to hold them?
> I sold a bunch of puts on GME and GME. I'm going to hold them for at least 1 year, but could be 3-5 years if the market doesn't crash before then
nice.. good luck getting rid of them if the market does crash

I think now is the best time in a while for a Tesla short.  Musk’s sales keep a lid on the stock for now and easily could drift back down to around 800-850 as people/algos realize it’s hard to fight that kind of sell volume
My Tesla puts are fucked right now
I personally like a short better than than puts.  The bulls won’t let it sudden crash, but I think it bleeds down, favoring a slow short
I think you are spot on. Which is wasn’t down so much and could get out of this position today. Hoping it bleeds down tomorrow or else I’m seriously bigly fucked. I went in way over leveraged
I’d like to give a quick shout out to Master Chief. Thank you for all that you’ve done for humanity.

NVDA 320 is not a meme.   Can’t get to 420 without going through 320.
Next leg up will be PYPL 🚀
Wish I wasnt poor and could buy leaps
So it's TSLA holding everything up?

Cool, that's not terrifying
Imagine if there was a healthcare company stock like the military one from cyberpunk where they have helicopters and private soldiers n shit.
People that put trailing stop-losses on semi-volatile growth stocks are pussies and need to be executed
YES
I listened to retards telling me to panic sell my December AMD calls and now I pay the price
That’s why I quit options days like yesterday would fuck me up wayyyy too much to hold through November
Hope CNBC got a commission with how hard they pumped RIvian.
Can’t wait for them to not mention it again
Yesterday was all-day RiVian
SPY calls if you love America
I fucking love America. That place is fucking dope
Why we drilling
Big money asked for some drilling so they could buy cheaper SPY calls

why won't telsa die?
it's the paradigmatic bubble stonk in the Great Retard Bubble period of history in which we find ourselves
Tsla buyers just take a couple weeks off and buy back when tsla is 850-900, it’s not that big of a deal you’re not missing life changing money buying a $1T stock….. what you think it’s gonna x20 again? Fucking idiots
riding puts down til it bottoms out at 900 is the only reasonable thing to do right now
You know it's options plays right?
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
What are you talking about, shares?
The year is 1993. SPY is $45 a pop and you can smack a waitress’s ass with no repercussions. Good times.
People could still laugh along with blazing saddles and not get offended.
you said this already
SPY calls you better make up for yesterday
Dark money empowers the worst forces in politics. It prevents citizens from understanding what’s going on in their own democracy.
The worst part is, those costs are passed onto the people being screwed, so they're paying to be fukt.
I wish bears were brave enough to stick around on green days. Those fuckers scurry back to their holes at any hint of adversity. Weak
nah, they are watching. just too pussy to post. stupid bers

How are people holding Tesla here, it’s literally hanging on by a thread and any second can drop 10%
Here is walls street bets
I wish it would drop 10%. Id load the boat
Simple. These people have elongated masochism.
 I've been in and out of lcid so many times now, I feel like a priest and his alter boy.
If you degenerates can go ahead and start dumping RBLX, that’ll be great. Need my puts to print. Thanks
Wow glad I unloaded this morning for 18%. Good time to jump back on though
I just want you to know: no matter where you are in your career, you’re probably doing better than me and I think that’s okay.

I am looking for a new full time job in the tech industry and using my old title as an analyst to hopefully land me a 80-100k job. Previously I made about 45-50 range. 28 years old. Sql and basic python, some experience with excel vba/data visualization. 

Great things coming your way. I hope I can fake my way to a good 6 figure job in tech. 

Plus I’m losing money.

Shitty career path so far + shitty losses + getting fucking older + cant get girls + fap all day.

Time to change something. Congrats on being better than me
I’m a security guard and live with my mom
Living the life
Its the little things in life. Go connect with ppl network better get yourself out of your norm.take that risk just dont go over the edge if tour scared of heights
go to the gym?
Are you in my cubicle right now?
Grind leet code hard everyday for like 2 months and you'll get a 150k+ tech job easily.
Not that easy. Especially when you’re still new to this vs. Software people who took it for 4 years in school. Im a business major
Pro-tip from someone that's been in the tech industry awhile and doing fairly well for myself:

Figure out if you want to be technical (coding, SQL, etc.) or project/business facing and pick a path and commit to it. Floundering somewhere in the middle will probably keep your salary lower than it should be. 

Project Management, Business analysis, Product management, etc. are great career paths, but you probably need to drop your technical skillset and work harder at documentation, complex planning, and business acumen. Also getting your PMP will net you about 20k salary immediately (assuming you go towards Project or Product management as a career path). If that doesn't sound interesting, go to a coding academy and build your technical skills deeper. Engineers shouldn't be making under 120k in this market.
Aren’t business analysts/project managers just as technical? Most of the ones I know in tech are doing python scripts/coding/automating on top of doing analytics. 

Also how stressful is project management? Especially coming from 0 experience, but have experience in analytics at some “tech” company? 

Thing is I know I don’t want to do full on coding because I’m just not skilled enough and I find it hard whereas I feel like others can leetcode shit so easily or can at minimum brute force while I can’t. 

I also don’t want to be non-technical at all because that would mean lower potential salary. I want to be at a good place. 

That’s why I always cant decide between cloud/business analyst/project manager(no exp)/salesforce analyst, etc. Idk what to do. 

Im 28 too… time is ticking
Just as technical? Not a shot. Technical enough to understand dependencies, help solution, and drive project progress? Absolutely. 

Project Managers front most (if not all) of the political bullshit that goes along with building software, so yes it can be incredibly stressful. This is why they are valuable when they are good. 

Business analysts do a lot of juggling of both worlds, which is why they are extremely in demand right now. The problem is it can be somewhat of a dead-end job once you hit the 120k area, unless you go into management or consulting. 

There is no easy, non-stress path unfortunately. It's really a decision of technical or less technical with a bit more stress and responsibility. Those who pick one and hone those skills early tend to succeed far more than those who waver between them. 

Also, subject matter expertise is as valuable as gold. Staying with a tech company for more than a few years to allow yourself to understand all the little ins and outs of it's internal and external systems can be extremely profitable if you'd rather not be a hot shot coder that makes money purely on efficiency, speed, and quality. 

I work with a ton of engineers that are valuable (and get paid stupid money) simply because they know the systems like the back of their hand - and are relied on because of it. Not so much because of their skills.
Honestly appreciate the feedback. What do you do if you don’t mind? 

So right now I’ve done some work as an analyst doing some sql in snowflake, basic python, excel, data visualization tools (nothing amazing) at a somewhat of a “tech” company. 

I did my azure fundamentals certs but i didnt really learn anything tbh. 

I do eventually want to make 6 figures. I just really don’t know what path.

When you talk about SME, are you talking in terms of a skill? For example, if I wanted to be a salesforce business analyst, knowing salesforce in the back of my head? Get salesforce certs? 

Or is it better to be a general Business Analyst who has some tech knowledge but not an expert but know the business inside out? 

I dont think im smart enough to be a deveoper that makes 300k+ but im stuck at this point in ny career.

Ive debated between:

1. Business analyst at a tech company
2. Get salesforce certs and work as a salesforce BA
3. Idk about project manager, my people skills are o-k. Which takes product manager out of the picture? 
4. Something to do with the cloud? Idk if I’d be smart enough for cloud architect lol plus 0 experience.

Not sure if there are other 6 figure tech jobs I could do. Data analyst I feel like it’s capped at like 80-90k whereas i do see some business analyst breaking that point.
Dude shut the fuck up with the pity party shit. You have skills and experience, you will find a decent job. 

There are millions, millions of people who are 10-20+ years older than you who have far less to offer than you do.

You can be a valuable asset to the world if you quit putting yourself down and stop letting the world walk all over you. I say this as someone who used to be on the very bottom of society- I put myself down there, I'm not a victim, I did it to myself. 

But I stopped blaming the world for my own problems and quit feeling sorry for myself and even though I'm still pretty far down the socioeconomic ladder I'm 10x what I used to be. 

The same can happen for you. So go make it happen.

empires last about 250 years. they go through six stages: pioneers, conquest, commerce, affluence, intellectual achievement, decadence.

and decadence is marked by ─

- debasement of currency
- economic crises
- public shows to distract the populace
- chefs as celebrities, emphasis on food pleasure (part of a vain search to recapture the old feeling of national greatness)
- apathy
- sexual obsession

It wants to go to 25…
My ex GF was a dumb ho but she was hot and she was artsy and now I don’t have a hot artsy GF to go to museums and watch movies with and sit on my face and it makes me sad
Why’d you break up if she was dumb and hot?
I was in a real shitty place in life, we’re very different people, probably should’ve broken up earlier tbh. 

This was just over 3 years ago now 🤷‍♂️
Well was she good in bed at minimum? And could you FWB her?
Hmmm complex answer. Terrible at riding but gave incredible head and she was a freak so I’d say overall very good sex. 

Did the FWB thing all lockdown but that kinda fizzled out and I don’t want to lose face by being the first to hit her up n’am say’n.
Artsy chicks are either wife material or whores. No in-between.
Yeah she’s pretty great. She says you had a small pp and mine is better. F

Risky 💅
485c 11/19 is blown up. I like the other 2 plays tho
Look at my TA chart & update yourself with Evergrande, it will make sense.
well, that first one is not going to help you with that plan
Nah China not going into a financial recession. You notice the market lag in the summer looking at the chart?
since options have both price and time components, looking at everything in the macro will not help you with the time aspect. You could be right but a week late and get nothing.
That’s why I got long calls to hedge, worth the risk
i really like all your others but the nov 19

Anyone else feel like this is a head fake and market will be flat or down eod?
Do people think ELON is done selling his shares? Not sure why $TSLA is up. 


He has 13mil shares to go.
Do people like you still think there’s a linear relationship between TSLA share price and how many shares musk had to sell? 

Yikes
> I love you
You sure are picky with your love
We don’t know how many he sold yesterday. He will probably be done selling today. 🚀
He just sold $1b and you think anyone cares about $13m? Lol
Sorry I meant to say 13 million shares. Not $13mil dollars. My bad.
I lost a lot of money I need a surefire 10 bagger play right now

Thinking delete my robinhood app so that i can 100% stop myself from gambling into options feel like drug
The trick is to just set aside gambling money from every check and not go beyond that threshold. Also make sure you’re maxing your 401k and Roth ira before you start gambling it’s not possible for everyone, but it’s the smartest approach. All of my gambling money comes after those two things are handled.
oh yeah same, my retirement accounts riskiest plays are holding stocks like aapl/nvda/amd with no intention of ever selling until i'm like 55+
Thank u bro it makes me feel better
Robinhood = Fun account. 401K/IRA/Legit Brokerage = Boring stuff
Yup boring buy and hold. Correct.
You need to delete your grammar teacher from your life first
Sorry bro english is my 2nd language and im really dumb
you should delete robinhood either way

I need spy to hit 470 tomorrow or my gambling ACC officially explodes
mine already imploded... now im here for the comments...
may i ask how much your down? lol
I invested about 10k total then I was up to around 15k then down to almost 6k then I got over 100k and thought I knew what i was doing and now I have about two pennies to rub together
I did take 10 k out before I lost it all so I guess im back to where I started? lol
jesus christ man . 100k to 0? thats fucking insane.  didn't you think to put some aside at least when you fell from 100 to 10k
> I lost all my money gambling on the roulette table.
If you aren't willing to sell when youre up there is probably no amount that would make you say ok yeah thats enough. Another problem was I watched my account blip from 120k then freeze then blip to over 500k then freeze and then drop massive after it opened up again. There wasnt much I could do and when i saw those numbers I was like I gotta get back up! lol
pretty much same here man, I made 30k in like 4 days from betting on spy calls. Then ofc I leveraged everything into one giant bet that could possibly triple my acc and yea........
Youll get back there man. Fuckin options bro lol
you too man. What's next for you after that big loss tho? are you planning on depositing more in the future and getting back in the game? haha
I told myself if I lost it all I wouldnt go back in, but its soo hard to stay away.... it whispers to me at night... lol I also got the mine equipment going day and night and at least that account is making me money vs this shit

PayPal is absolutely garbage.

There genuinely isn't a public company I consider less valuable than PayPal.

Shorting it to 0.
Weird I use PayPal almost daily and I like it
Wait till they openly admit to stealing your money.

I won't accept or deal with anyone that uses paypal
Never had any issues getting refunds through PayPal or anything like that not sure what you mean. Ive heard streamers get fucked through charge backs sometimes but that doesn’t affect me at all
I replied to another dude with my issue with PayPal.

They're the only company to ever admit to stealing my money and just saying "we don't have the tech to refund you"
Can you link to your reply to that other dude then? Would like to know more
I'll paste it.

PayPal is the only company to genuinely openly admit to stealing my money.

I had purchased an item on Ebay through PayPal that didn't arrive and ebay issued me a refund through PayPal but PayPal didn't process it correctly and eBay closed the case.

And PayPal were like "Sorry we've had a technical error we can't refund your money even though Ebay has authorised us to because the case is closed on their end"   Ebay kept saying they had sent it and PayPal kept saying even though Ebay have sent it the case is marked as closed so they can't give it to me. 

I had to get a charge back from my bank but PayPal literally said they were unable to give me my funds.

I won't use PayPal under any circumstances now I don't accept it for buying or selling.
Wow that’s fucked dude
It's even worse.  The seller genuinely had issues he wasn't trying to scam me so he admitted he couldn't post the item.  There was no dispute the money was taken from his account and PayPal were trying to pocket it ($350) 

This was in January 2020.  I got my money back from my bank but haven't used PayPal since.

Shorting to 0.

Fuck PayPal.
Good luck with that tho at least you have a good bank
Can u elaborate in a short post here why u think that? Genuinely curious as I’ve been thinking of buying the dip lately. I mean I use them and like them, simple service. Plus they have venmo on their side. What’s ur beef?

Bro wtf did PSFE ceo punch a baby or something?
They just saw how PRPL performed and wanted to do the same.
Elon sold 4.5 / 17 million shares he plans to sell. So 27%.
Yeah idk why that makes it moon
People only see that he sold so they assume he’s done
I mean, if it only gets down to around 1050 on him selling 20%, then immediately jump up to 1090 what'll it get down to, like 800 by the time he's done? Baby dip considering how quickly it ran up before, literally nothing worth worrying about, just buy, hold, average down, then forget about it for a few years.

This is not financial advice.
Yeah I kinda wanna fade this fake pump but puts are so expensive now. Might have to just do shares.

Do whatever you want until 30.
Wrong sub dude, but vary that diet.... you can get all the protein you need (and some extra cash) round the back of Wendies.
Yea your body gets too acidic I heard. Eat more poultry
Diet science is literal trash fyi.  There are very few things we definitively know about nutrition.  Excessive salt is bad.  Too much sugar is bad.  Excess calories are bad.  Hydration is good.  Vitamins and minerals are good (and better when gained through food).

Almost everything else is complete bullshit and based on stupid 30 people sample size studies with minimal controls.
BYND bro. It isnt that bad at all
no, that shit won't do anything to you until you hit 30 at least. enjoy it.
You'll be dead by 40 no matter what so why bother

Wow everyone who bought puts for anything are absolutely fucked
Mega fucked!
Fucking lost 20% yesterday and sold half my ford calls at the fucking bottom. Ended the day below 25k so now I have a day trade restriction. Now ford if back up... what the actual fuck
Doing nothing is half the battle broski.
Tell me about it. They were for 11/19 and 11/26 so it’s not like they were running out of time
What's really fucked up is the three day trade restriction is retroactive, so if you did for trades in the last week, you'll be asked to top it up or get locked.

But a call to your broker can unlock it, so don't sweat it too much.

Stop over trading
I have/had over 25k. I can day trade as much as I want. No reason to be limited if I have the money to do it. Obviously don’t have the balance now but still

ive had beyond burgers and theyre pretty good. you can sear them on a pan it acts just like meat and its also plant based. not a bynd holder just saying.

i like the burgers tbh

must mean S&P is gonna shoot up 50+ points on random nothing news. happened last march and one other time when everyone was short spy. Couldnt log in or sell and when i could log in i still couldnt sell. Watched my account get eviscerated in under an hour. gooood times...
Why would you want to log into Robinhood?
> Because you can trade stocks for free.
Are you Bulgarian?
You can do that with real brokers who don't fuck you on the daily. And the cool part of a real broker is that they actually purchase the shares when you put in a buy order.
So I can sell out of stocks and make money. I really need to switch brokers though, they;ve been pissing me off lately

Standard lunch rush on the east coast. It’s discount hour!
So puts on Rivian when options open?
IV will likely be too high to make a ton as it will likely collapse as the price moves down.

If you want to play it to the short side you'd want to either do straight stock or call spreads
I don't know why people say the Rivian truck and the Ford Lightning are in competition. The Rivian truck is double the price, smaller, has a longer battery range, and does 0-60 in 3 seconds. Whereas the Ford is much bigger, has more utility uses like serving as a generator to power your entire house during a blackout, is priced comparably to their current F-150s and again starts around 40k vs the Rivian 75k. 

They're for two completely different groups. Contractors and companies will absolutely buy the Ford for it's size and power bank functionality. And wealthier people who want a truck sized sports car will go with the Rivian.
Ford lacks the nefarious ambition of Jeff Bezos being obsessed with Elon.

People are
Playing on Bezos’ obsession with Elon.
No we are not. Stop projecting.
In order for me to project, I’d have to be playing Rivian and Ford.

Which I’m not. Dumped F positions yesterday for profit.
If i was a contractor id buy a Cybertruck. Great attention getter for the company.
I mean there's only Ford, Rivian, and Tesla (eventually) in the EV pick up game afaik so you're gonna have comparisons drawn

EDIT: I guess Toyota is interested in making their Tundra an EV so more comparable to the F150 but still a concept for now it seems
What about Lordstown and Foxconn? lol
Is *that* who fucking RIDE is? lmao Yeah wasn't aware of them so definitely more comparable to the F150 than Rivian's stuff
For now, only bc Ford has a backing as the good ol' 'Murican car company. These things change. It's the 21st century. Ford will still be around but these very 20th century companies are boomer companies. TSLA RIVN are the future.
So ur saying RIVN 200B?
Absolutely. If they can do what TSLA is doing and maintain a high demand with a small supply then their valuation could really take off. As a profitable automaker with a reasonable valuation, check back in 2030. But as s long as they stay in the speculative high growth area then their value could go over 200B.
Everyone arguing F and GM should be worth more don't realize the EV stocks will eventually tank bringing F and GM down too but not as much
That’s because when the main EV stock tanks (TSLA) the entire stock market shits the bed
GME is the Deathstar cooling vent 

It's a fucking Tendie Filled Piniata or TFP as the kids would say
Guys, stop selling! Think about Lorde Edge
He’s dumping on his cult….sad
so uhh tesla gonna do anything today?

Elon is a clout chaser, he made a poll but has always planned on selling his shares since September, he just wants more GenZ fan boys
Don’t make fun of Daddy Elon
it was a signal to retail. he was doing people a favor if you listened.
Yea but Tesla fanboys made it seem like a good thing.
What would he have done if the twitter poll voted No?
Cohens GME gag order ends in 2 weeks and he can speak for the 1st time. 

You're gonna fomo into GME at 350 in 2 weeks, you'd be smarter to get an entry here.
gag order?
Yeah he hasn't been allowed to talk for 1 year since he bought his stake. Was part of the takeover agreement for whatever reason
You sure? You said AMD was opening at $180 on Tuesday
SPY is going to drill at open, isn't it?
I guess so
And so the 10 day consecutive green day pattern resumes. SPY 500 by end of next week.
That's not what consecutive means. But go green!
People who slowly inch up at a red light the entire time until it’s green annoy the ever living shit out of me why didn’t you just get close enough and stop like every other normal person
You’re soft for being annoyed by petty shit

For those who are under the age of forty and have grown up in the United States or Europe, inflation is an abstraction, a number that governments report on and experts talk about, but not something that is central to their investing or regular lives. For those who are older or grew up in countries with high inflation, inflation is far more than a number, wreaking havoc on savings and exposing fault lines in economies and societies.
True. A painful side effect of inflation is high interest rates. This will hit you hard if you borrow to buy a house or car.

Youd be a dumb ape to buy 3k in dispo pre rolls
no shit, i dont have to lol
Love that. Enjoy the smoke dawg
No electric, seed, medium, fertiliser cost?
ive had the setup for a couple years now, so yea maybe $5 worth of nutes and maybe $10 for electric
Only $725 for 7.25oz here in Florida from the dispo.
wow i guess your taxes are super low?
No tax on medical weed ✌️
Futes rippin
IV crush on Sofi should be sweet for put and calls sellers alike :)
IV crush on ur life would be better.
lol. What an ass
So glad I closed my puts before close. Hoping my shares moon now.
Futes ain’t shit but hoes and tricks
Oh Pfizer shill deleted all his comments. Guess he didn’t like being called out.
Mrna to 500?
Oh cool shocker market is green as shit and my puts are dead what the fuck
Yup back to regularly scheduled pump easy
Just wait
For more put losses? Gotcha
I want to get back into TSLA but I feel like this pump is MM's trying to hand their bags off to retail....back to losing money I guess.
It’s 100% a fake pump
Thanks, I take solace in knowing if I am crazy at least I am not the only one.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
People are desperate to cling to hope but if it somehow does moon to ATH that will just be time to short it again. “Oh Elon sold a small part? We must be done!” Makes no sense.
The beautiful bounce back
$ROOT crushed earnings
Should've bought calls on everything yesterday.
That’s what I’m saying. Going be a green day .
We didn't have a red day for long I thought it would last another day, at least.
Everyone panic sold because of Evergrande. Look at the data from when it was released they were "defaulting" (bad journalism) and then look at when they paid the bonds.. after market close everything sky rocketed.
Ahh thanks for the extra info. :).Evergrande defaulting has been feared for awhile. I'm surprised someone actually published saying they DID default without proper DD.
It's speculated this was done so Evergrande could short the market.  Everyone was on edge prior to this news. That, or journalism majors need a new fucking job on reporting facts and bullshit.
shoulda coulda woulda
Let me regret in peace 😔
what plays are you thinking about today?
Well I was planning on getting a monthly call on AFRM if we had another red day but it's already up.

Might pickup SQ leap since it's been going down so much. You?
I have 5k to yolo in an FD. Trying to decide what it will be.... any suggestions? no fun earnings to play and I have holding weeklies over the weekend. I feel like peleton puts are a safe bet? idk
Peleton is already down 46% in less than a week, you think it'll have room to fall more? I usually don't buy puts after a harsh fall and it looks like a really slow fade.

If you want to buy puts I would wait until WISH goes up a little more. I'm holding shares and it keeps dipping below $5 when it tries to test the $5.50 mark.
I already have wish puts that I bought on Monday :) but it’s a small position. Ape tickers are always risky. Not sure if I would risk 5k on it even tho it’s a horrible company
Oh that's good! Yeah I don't usually bet against ape tickers either. Are you looking to just buy puts or are you open to other strategies? If you just want to buy yolos/fds then TSLA is a good one bc it swings so much. Think it might go up even tho Elon sold.
> I am open to other strategies. I have an algorithm that can be used for hedging, but it is very complicated and requires a lot of data so I don't use it at this time.
Stfu
Tesla FDs it most likely is :) will see how it reacts after open then decide
Ok hope you make lots of tendies! Sorry if you don't.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Buy puts this time so you can go to 0
Don't double dare me.
DO IT!! Triple dare you
I'll do the opposite to spite you.
If you shart today you're not a good patriot
What if you have ibs? Asking for a friend 🥺
All or nothing. Worst comes to worst, it's not a shart if you commit to shitting yourself
Fair enough, shitting myself now 😎
I bought calls yesterday, I hope you did too
Oh yeah, I bought calls. 

DIS calls..
:O
A truly retarded position in DIS 11/19 $180c
hey i did that too
You thinking they’re gonna be .01 on open?
I think they're gonna be -$.20 and we'll actually owe money for being stupid enough to think mickey wasn't gonna fuck us
We got *Mick dicked*
If it's over $1 i'll probably dump it. anything less and there's no point in not holding it to see if it recovers next week
I’m in the same camp. Hoping it’s worth over 1$ so I can sell it. Revenue was good, guidance was good, but they missed by pretty much every other metric.
I put in a $1 limit order. I'm doubtful it'll even fill with that but fingers crossed my friend
I have $185c 20 of them but hedged with puts
Bought my first baby contract for 26 dollars on INO and watched it tank to 18 in an hour. 

Woohoo! 8 days left.
I bought SPY calls for $130 Tuesday. They're currently at $7 and expire tomorrow
DIS getting WACKED, time to buy
Wonder if it will drop more before.
major trend line support at $163.20
Why has it kept dipping?
True, however this market does not abide by any trends. Who know what’s going to happen. It’s also mooned on no news before as well.
HUT Earnings up 40% yoy, 110% revenue increase, lowered debt by $39%. New partnerships brought in $500 million cash flow.

The rocket is launched
Hey, thanks for the leak comment yesterday, I bought 3k stocks because of you.  


Here's a gold! Thanks for the info!
Psyched - wish I had went in harder but ran out of funds buying the dip yesterday
They have an earning call?
Buyer - $CVX, $ASO, $AAPL, $NVDA
Weedstonk run comin
Yup. Charts looking great
SOFI saving my ass today.
I have yet to lose money selling short AMC vertical call spreads.
It's pretty smart, IV is hella high compared to realized and historical volatility.

Easy to get greedy and eventually get smashed though.
Evergrande doesn't matter.

A potential default has been global news for months. When the train is moving that slowly, people have time to get off the tracks. Any risk of wider impact or collapse is long gone.
Lehman's collapse was obvious for over a year but the market didn't give a shit.

Still i think you're right. Evergrande isn't another 2008.
It’s not exclusively evergrande related news coming out. Debt ceiling talks, inflation, labor shortages. Could be a bumpy ride during this traditionally bullish few months. Kind of a bummer but who knows how shit will play out.
so fucked with paysafe and clov..any help guys...![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)

Cant be in all the plays dawg
Everyone ensure you jack off for post-nut clarity before making any rash decisions. 

Or if you want just get calls and chill.
So now it's confirmed that Elon is selling, bag-holders are buying
We have to help Lord Musk! It’s not fair if he has to sell below 1k
Bro wtf are these overreactions you miss an earnings by 2% and you’re valuation gets sliced by a third 🤡
It’s almost as if a lot of shit is currently overvalued.
Go Elon go go go!  We autists are getting taken on a space ship to Mars.  I'm almost crying thinking about it.

Edit: $1 now
I sold all my $AAPL in July and bought COST and NVDA at the time. Probably the best decision I made this year. $AAPL is the big tech lame name.
Elon just gonna let it go up to 1100 again before selling another block.  Rinse, recycle, repeat.

Wsb: omg were drilling omg demon dildos
You mean the people whining about media manipulation of stocks are also manipulating via media, such as fudposting?
Bought SPY calls & puts, I can’t lose right?
Why is tech dumping
Everything rally combined with Santa claus rally is coming
Because it's way way way overbought over the last month. Needs at least a few days of correction.

When can we buy puts on Rivian ?
No kidding. 

No options on new issues until at least three business days after IPO date. [Source](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/072104.asp)

IPO was 11/10. Earliest options available is 11/15, Monday.
I'm out. Sold my FB calls. Oof
THANK YOU

335 eod
Riot is 8% up and its options are up 20%.
MARA up 9%
I will stfu for the rest of the year if SPY closes above 465
SNOW leaps puts? This piece of shit has pumped almost 100% since may for no reason. Trading at 110x revenue. I don’t see any way it can continue with this multiple next year when rates rise.
> Yeah. I've been shorting it for weeks now.
HOLD THE LINE HERE SPY AND UP WE GO
SoFi makes my pp so harddd
Working as a software dev is the best some weeks. This week i might havd worked 4 hours of real work out of 4 days from home and people are still satisfied with my work
Goals
Bootcamps worth it?
idk i did software engineering undergrad. but if you only do bootcamps you will have to do some personal projects and share your github to interviewers probably
Okay ... okay not this time... just a little bit... just a small amount on 1 option... just 1 little opt.... WOOOHOO JACK TO TITS WOOAHHH.... annnnd its gone
Did you (we) ever consider that you (we) might have a problem?
I didnt figure that out until I lost the over 100k that I made on a lottery play. Can you believe I actually thought I knew what I was doing? Hahaha oh yeah its def a problem
35k for me. Same deal
I need to take a fat piss. My balls are going to look like raisins afterwards
Pee is stored in the balls
Piss is stored in the prostate ya regard!!!
At this point, WISH should just cease operations and invest their remaining 1.1B in SPY and make anywhere from 10-20% profit a year! They’ll actually make consistent money for once!
I got a feeling SPY is gonna dump EOD but be green from then on out
staying between $464-67 til Monday then we’ll see it run a little bit mostly stay around $470
will my amd calls going up?
SDC, ROOT, WISH, SNDL: if you have one or more of these stocks in your memefolio, you need to evaluate your memevesting strategy.
I’m short SDC. Bear Call Spread. Theta ganging that shit.
Best strategy IMO. IV is high so don't want to be buying options straight up.
Why not just say if you have any of these?
I don't know. What the fk do I know? These questions are making me upset.
It's alright lebron your just a Flopper, we understand
Oh, hello NVDA, welcome back!
Nvda heard u talking shit sup bro
$RIDE going to $2 after earnings release
AMD baby. Pump!
Really sold my AMD calls down 70% this morning hours ago FML
Same. But i ended up with nvda calls instead 🙃
Damn tip
Anyone have an opinion on SNDL and the earnings ? Supposedly 300m shares on loan? Idk I'm just a crayon eating noob.
Going to be an eye opener to many whales once the Q3 results comes out. Load up.. you will thank yourself later!! Q3 will be good but Q4 will be epic. Getting in early is key. nfa
All personal opinions aside they have a disgusting amount of cash on hand
Grabbed 2024 PSFE calls, they reach 100 I become Millionaire
i love that this travis scott shit is bringing back satanic panic

maybe this will get the conspiracy theorists shunned from proper society again after getting too accepted because of covid shit
not likely after how right we have been proven the past 2 years, you used to comment with us - what happened?
conspiracy theorists are scum i got banned from the sub for being correct about the sub being a hub for far right brainlessness that is good for literally nothing
haha, sorry to hear about the ban, censorship is virtually always wrong.
i broke the rules of calling out the sub so it makes sense

it was a long time coming tbh i only perused that sub to troll those brainlets anyways
yeah, I remember, just recognized the username is all
Honestly considering only buying on red days from now on. Every time I buy on a green day I get burned
TSLA 1000P FDs are cheap if any one wants to roll the dice
Damn if that hits
u/AxemanFromMA and anyone else buying the 12/31 500c - if you plan on holding those anywhere near to the date of expiration, you’re basically betting on SPY going up almost $40 between now and then. Look at the amount SPY has moved between 11/10 and 12/31 for the last few years. 

In 2018, SPY went *down* by about $20 between those dates

In 2019, SPY went up by about $11 between those dates

In 2020, SPY went up by about $15 between those dates

I’m not saying it can’t happen because it could, but it seems pretty unlikely. Yes, growth speed has accelerated, but still. If we get a few really big days in the next couple of weeks, $7-$10 days or something, you’ll probably be good, but if shit continues like it has been the last couple weeks those contracts are fucked.
Just gamblin
What about my 12/23 500 calls
Those should be fine
axemanFromMa is fucking clown who has a very limited grasp of how the market works. Not saying i'm some scholar over here but that guy is a true fucktard
https://ibb.co/dBqtBwt

You don’t understand. The market lag in the summer was because of Evergrande/China (second highest GDP) going into a possible reccesion till of last night. We have Build Back Better coming in and Nov/Dec/Jan are the most bullish months. Also the market is still in the COVID bubble.
lol stop linking that chart dude it doesn’t prove shit. Yes, Nov/Dec are bullish months and yet look at how much SPY has moved up between today’s date and Christmas over the last several years. Nowhere even close to the amount you’re betting it will. 

As far as Build Back Better, this is exactly like all your other dumb imaginary catalysts. First you said the debt ceiling thing was gonna save your 10/15 calls and that didn’t work out. Then you kept saying the infrastructure deal was going to make SPY explode. Infrastructure deal passed over the weekend and SPY has done nothing but drop until today, and it looks like it might end red today. What makes you think Build Back Better is going to be different? You were so certain those other two things would be massive catalysts for SPY to explode and you were 100% wrong both times.
dude don't even bother arguing with this dude. He's a straight up window licker.
I know, it’s so unsatisfying. I just want him to see reason but it’s no good, he just links that dumb chart and refuses to actually address any specific points. Lol. I’ll just leave him to his madness
Yeah but but but my TA 😁😁🤡just keep calling him a fucking clown. You just can’t reason with stupid haha
Bagholder spotted.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Go ahead. Inverse me, lets see whos right.
Oh, I do think SPY is gonna go up and we’re get a Christmas rally. Those contracts are just way too far OTM to print
Not based on my TA.
lol. Okay man. When those expire worthless don’t say you weren’t warned. 

About a week ago when I brought up your 10/15 450c you said “I was retarded then, I learned” but this 12/31 500c is the exact same type of play. You didn’t learn anything and something tells me after these 500c expire worthless you still won’t learn the lesson lmao
You do realize I can sell before $500 and make money right?
Of course. If you read my original comment you saw I said “if you plan on holding anywhere near to expiration”. 

But those are way OTM. To make any real amount of money on them you’re gonna need some big moves soon with very little pullback. We’ll see.
fucking clown
What’s your ACT score? -10000?

PYPL and ROKU. Both criminally oversold. PYPL to $300 by eoq 1 and ROKU to $500 by then 🚀 🌙
Jumped out of both of those sinking ships at a loss a month ago. Surprised to see them still drilling, but am also glad I got out.

Yeah, cash account
No i was notified by my brokerage i would get a good faith violation on my cash account because cash wont settle today

Its getting boring. Probably take couple of days off on wsb. This is my second to last comment for this morning
I’ve seen at least 3 comments since this one.
soooo did evergrande default or not?
They paid like 2 out of the 23 bonds they owe. Everyone keeps reporting they didn’t really default because of it.
Tuesday could be a green day, but it won't set a new all time high unless I'm still getting bamboozled

Ford is due for a rally today - added $8B to market cap yesterday and baby got thrown out with the bath water on the market downturn.
Let's hope so...I mean Rivian has a larger market cap than F...illogical to me.

.....and PSFE continues to pile drive me deeper into the hole. Down 64% since Steve Grasso recommended it. I should have paper handed this thing when I was 10% down.....or 15% down....or 20% down.....or 30% down......or 40% down.....maybe 69% down will be my number.

F # @ !
Wait till 100% loss so you get nice tax break
I'll probably be stupid enough to wait until it hits 69 cents and quadruple down!
I am currently at 69.18% down (that came fast)....I'm still holding, so....nope 69% down was not my number.

Maybe it is time to learn about puts. With my luck, I'll buy a put and it will go up 69%

Well by the looks of that big red candle after announcing earnings, im going to go out on a limb and say their earnings were bad.

What are you gonna do? How much damage you in for?
Down 8k on my 3k shares and who knows on my leaps when market opens lol
Hey, I just checked back to see PSFE decimated. Did you sell? How heavy are your bags? I’m down a shit ton
holy FUCK thank god i only went in for 100 shares at 9

Sell covered calls 1 dollar OTM till they get called away lol
the only smart thing i did last week was buy $VALE at the bottom 🚀 UP UP AND AWAY
tfw you meant to buy puts on PSFE and forgot because of meetings all day
I could use making some money in the market today, would help me a lot. Let's hope.
I'm so glad I sold PSFE at $13 just to breakeven a few months back 😂😂
Such an oof stock. The SPAC overpaid to bring it public
When you guys stop buying PSFE then it will bounce

SPY doing a show of force against Tesla, so far whenever TSLA has dumped SPY has joined it, show Musk we dont give a shit if he fails
If you’re buying spy you’re buying tesla

Tell me your 0dte lotto nonsense
ICLN with new bill soon
ICLN is largely non-US and will not benefit greatly from the infrastructure bill. 

You also suggested me an ETF play based on upcoming legislation when I asked for 0dte lotto nonsense. Totally unacceptable.
I'm up 80% since writing this on the 1dte 🤷‍♂️
what bill? I thought it was infrastructure?
>nonsense
What’s the play?
Slightly otm calls for next week, pretty otm calls this month. This is a pure retard play, hence why I'm confident
What could possibly be pumping the Russell besides hard dick and bubblegum
The fact PYPL has been going down since late July is just hilarious. Lmao I don’t even feel like my 2/18/22 are even safe anymore
I bought the dip, and it kept dipping
Pls Chgg dont do this to me.
revenue side is going to be trouble for a while. they literally may have peaked in the US, and market hates buying slow growth / descent. 

it could get really ugly.
Anyone buying TWTR?
Still not back to my ROOT cost basis. Even after selling CC. FML.

467 and 468 spy calls bought Monday. Hold to tomorrow praying for a rebound. Or sell today for monster losses?
hold we going to melt up
I like your optimism
when's expiration? if it's this week then take the losses, otherwise hold
They expire tomorrow. Theta can chance to be in the money. At this point it’s probably a loss no matter what. But right now it’s a big loss. A little loss would be better. I bet big on uppies and it went downies.
that sucks

I learned my lesson to never buy weeklies, only sell them while buying leaps

good luck to you sir
Is PSFE gonna report their earnings or what ????
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
BYND out here getting taken to the butcher.
good product, terrible company
Eyeballing BLNK idk where to go with it tho
here comes the pain
If RKLB reports strong earnings and launches successfully Monday, the stock is going to absolutely explode
And if they don’t nail both of those things it’s going to die a horrible death.
Earnings on the 15?
Yeah earnings AM on Monday and the launch is planned for Monday night (in US time, so midday Tuesday in NZ)
Waiting on the NASDAQ to die so we can commence the dump
I see green but nothing is happening. Fake and 🌈
yes it is fake but market won’t actually crash until new year

RBLX round 2
I'm not doubting it again. Hate the stupid game but millions of others do.
It's not even a game, look on youtube, people are making their own story telling videos, and they're pretty funny.
Should I just hold my wish outside overnight
Does a satellite smartphone make me cool?

-sent from my Pi phone
I told you a month ago that Wish was despite how cliche it sounds a low downside, high upside play, but everyone called me a bagholder.
People over use the term bag holder. I’ve bought and sold wish multiple times for profit. It’s pretty clear where the floor is.
I agree. Not $50 but for sure not $5. What surprised me is the hate against this stock. Everybody is so happy it is going down and that people are losing money. Some dynamics in social media are very strange
RBLX is such a B word
So LNG is out and uranium is back in? I can't keep up with the hip and groovy trends these days.
What's the story on RIVN?
Ipo pump.  I’m going to get in some long positions next week or the week after personally

Yup every day is just a slow bleed

Yeah I bought 200 more shares Tuesday. Think I'm going to get some more December 17 $70 calls. This seem like a major over reaction at this point.

Hold steady lunch time dip possibly then we moon
NKLA boys it’s happening
Did they find a way to roll the stock uphill?
> Yes, they did. They used a ball bearing and an inclined plane. The experiment was successful but the company went bankrupt due to lack of funding for further development (the stock market crashed).
VMod. 🧠
Yes they found out they can pull it up the hill with a rope and 25 strongmen. Truly groundbreaking
Not a real company.
It’s still real to me Goddamit
Fine.. fake company, real pain. Hope you profit !
If plug could hit 45 mañana that’d be tight
DASH puts feel like a pretty good intraday play right now
I called it yesterday.  It was 7% shorted and there were a crap load of 11/12 ITM calls created by the surprise jump in price following the earnings report.
Why would you flirt with a breakout? Better off playing roulette
It's already up 8% with nothing material backing it and it's perpetually volatile. A small retreat today during the day is a more reasonable gamble than most things on the roulette table
Honestly Roblox is a game full of terrible low quality games, but kids love it.
Thinking if I hold my spy 11/29 470c I bought like 2 weeks back… should have sold on fri but I didnt

Nothing like losing a thousand and chasing it just to lose another thousand ……humbling experience 🤡
I was down $12K yesterday but an selling option  prematurely for a $300 loss hurt me more today.
Currently down 12k. Hoping something recovers

(I want to buy the dip but it looks like a sad staircase down to shitsville)
imo anything under 25 is fair; anything above is overpriced.
If you like it then get it gee
>(I want to buy the dip but it looks like a sad staircase down to shitsville)

Their aquisition of smaller companies like SCUF, Elgato, etc has helped them carve out a name for themselves in a market full of giants like logitech. They have also been adament that last years increase in revenue was not just a fluke from the rona. They expect demand to actually be higher than last year and are estimating they will make 1.9 billion to 2.1 billion in revenue. (A 17% increase from last year)
Their Y/Y stats for Q3 report were dogshit. You’re saying that for 2022 they are actually expecting to exceed 2020 revenue?
The CEO already stated they expected growth to slow for the ladder half of 2021. Their Q3 was underwhelming, but they mainly cited supply chain difficulties as the issue, not volume of customers. Shipping cost and GPUs are digging into their revenue, but they were pretty adament that they would be able to achieve at least a 7% growth from last year on the conservative side, even if things do not improve.
I should just force myself to buy puts alongside my calls if I’m gonna lose this much money Jesus

Just got margin called Virgin... Thanks
Cmon blockhead break rip through 100 already lol
Dude so grateful to see the shorts finally get theirs on $PTRA. We finally had a good day with the Infra bill coming out and then the next day boom 43% short interest. They were banging their chests on the boards and had wiped out our gains... until earnings...🤑🚀
People are buying a ton of phony dog poo off of WISH today. Moon motherfucker!
portfolio is on a moderate WMW recovery from yesterday. all green, but only +$100 on the week lmao 


please go up SPY
SOFI and BROS doing me right so far…maybe I’ll go see if the new BROS location down the street is open…
Its the worse thing when u know how good it is but they take 5+ months to build and staff
Still not open, so I went to and supported a local business with the same type business model.  Will probably continue to support the local business more than the corp chain…
So Mara is back to where it was before earnings dump and I'm down 30%. Fuck IV.
Puts on small no name pharma stocks pre-earnings is just free money

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/robmiller656 (0/1) made a bet that SNDL would go to 0.75 when it was 0.6547 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Pay was not safe. PSFE down 41%
Gonna try to take profit or low losses and go cash gang. Partly for uncertain markets but mostly cuz I can't seem to trade well getting off of night shift. Guh
probably a good idea, I'm expecting some craziness before Thanksgiving.
I guess it's also gang witching week or whatever, monthly call expiry 11/19. I think that tends to increase the volatility
Holy shit PSFE. Sold at $10 for a 30% loss a few months ago and almost bought back in at $7.25. Dodged a bullet there. Wonder what the bottom will be. Seems like a good time to get back in but shit has gone down nonstop since the merger.
Is it even a good company?

I'm thinking mid 3's
Really hope these PSFE Jan2023 $5c pay off. Only way I’m recouping this week’s losses is landing a 10 bagger
Cmon IWM. Keep going up
If you’re not buying this dip on Disney then you aren’t a believer in the dreams of little children everywhere
Coupang earnings better be good today. I'm down 90% on 4 month old leaps. Just want like 25% of it at this point

Anyone else soaking up POSH?
Out of all of the scams that dipped yesterday, I had to buy the one that didn't pump 4% today.
Almost time for a margin er I mean margarita call!  Lol
FSR ripping.  This should hit $25 tofah
bond market closed so there’s nothing to remind investors that they are retarded
Looks like market is going sideways / consolidating, probably until Monday. Guess I’ll do some work and stop watching the ticks. Probably for the best. Could use some low vol after crazy past few weeks
Thank god GayME showing signs of life I was busy at work and didn’t have time to sell my calls on that last pump
Banks are closed it’s a fake AF trading day!
Trying to decide how to best lock in SoFi leap gains. Would setting a stop limit order at a set profit percentage be the best way to accomplish this?
Sounds legit, try not to lock in severe losses with stop losses
Who else is leap $RIDE-ing? It definitely seems as though its at a bottom and just was given $50mil
Your thoughts on ER beat/miss
Barely beat or barely miss - but probably with some positive news... gotta speculate they can take up more market cap in the EV space eventually as long as they are making progress... I think anything close will be positive
Tricky indeed
That triple bottom in FUBO looks tastyyyyyyyy
Paysafe shit the bed that bad?
Yes THAT bad.
Gonna look at the earnings.
PSFE leaps on deck bois, no way this goes bad
I said that 6000 shares ago. Welcome to the club.
I got 10 of the $6 leaps lol
I got shares and calls (they’re cheap af) in RIDE, in the green so far, thinking to close before ER today, do you think they beat or miss? Thanks
What earnings? Have they sold a single truck?
> Yeah, they're in the black.
Wow bruh, you’re genius
The ease at which PayPal allows boomers to buy c.r.y.p.t.0 makes me very bullish. Probably going to write some CSPs
Need a 0dte play
GOLD calls all day long
Spy has some bullish formations but I’m waiting still, if it takes off I’ll atleast close my puts temporarily
Its circle jerking but does looks like it gonna boom in coming hours
We traded pretty flat just like this yesterday... until noon.
You had to say it, didn't you. And there goes SPY...down the shitter.
SPY 1M and 3M looking spooky
Fast Money boys/girls coming on soon to tell everyone to keep their money in the market so they can get out before interest rate rise next year

Lol

!remindme 1 month
Is a sports betting company? Not talking about price or direction, just your statement.
That is the direction it is going. Just bought a 4m subscriber company in France.

They offer live odds and betting through the app on the game you're watching. Just opened apps in two states and plan on expanding to every state. 

The major focus of the FuboTV app is sports with a bit of a focus on soccer which is only growing and they are going to parlay it in to becoming a sports betting company to boost profits.
OK. Didn't know that. Gonna do some research.
Flood Gates are about to burst on FSR!  I'm mildly sweaty rn
Should I just all in BRK.B?  Yes, I’m poor.
If you do that be sure to call up geico and demand a discount. No joke, 8% off your insurance for holding that
There is literally no human being on Earth who does not qualify for that discount.  Used to be 15%, too.  If you can't bring yourself to say "I'm a Berkshire shareholder" over the phone to some phone droid who will not verify and who could care less, there are over 800 other ways to get the discount, like having once been gestated in a womb, or being a card-carrying Breathairean.
FCEL is on 🔥
It certainly is!! I see it in the 15-20 range by December

Man I'm stoked about FSR now, just wait til Cars hit the road!
I've been holding shares since it was called SPAC, it's nice to see it break out of the mundane 10-20 channel it was stuck in
That's awesome.  I'm a tiny fish with 400 shares at $15.86.  First year trading tho. So not bad I guessm.
Why is it pumping today been holding shares for awhile forget why i have them lol
Infrastructure bill passed.  EVs are cool.

I am incredibly bullish on geni and it’s been shitting the bed recently. If you like the idea of the plantair of sports betting, I’d pick some up now before earnings
I think you're the only bull on that one mate.
It has made me a lot of money and I see sports betting as a growing sector, but any advice on here is likely detrimental to your financial well-being

fsr is taking off hard I predict its going to 27
I guess I shouldn't have rejected the church. I don't know how, but this universal force always manages to send my winners too the god damn moon when I take measly profits but always shuts my shit down when I hold out for more. There's a karmic force that wants to keep me down. I'm sorry, Jesus :(
Why are you punishing the rest of us for his sins, Jesus?!?
Your weekly calls are wrekt. I hope my 11/19s are fine.

 Wow rip spy
Will you stop going down for once FB???
😔
I switched to calls without day trades at the very top, sold puts to do it
Sooooo I have calls almost worthless ...my question to you experts is do I have to SELL those contracts at a loss to claim the loss for lower taxes, or can I just hold them to expiry and still claim the loss?
Double down

Two negatives equal a positive
Doesn’t matter. If you sell early or let them expire worthless. A loss is a loss
Holding to expiry is fine.
it will be taken into account for your yearly p/l so yeah but might as well sell them and go get a chipotle brisket burrito
This makes so much more sense than a few bucks related to taxes.

Yes, i'm thinking 4.20 is a good price for my psfe stonks. Jolly good, govnor!
I'm always either 1 day too early or 1 day too late. RIP to my potential imagination profit
When riv options?
I’d buy puts immediately
I’ll sell you some puts
5 day minimum waiting period, the company has to apply in the first place, and there's a price threshold

mind you, I think RIVN is above the price threshold
If plug continues to pump I’ll be happy
3 more years of pump, plug is going to be a huge player very soon
Weird day AFRM gave a bunch of PM gains back and BROS and MQ gave it all back for some reason
all going into SOFI
SOFI is my biggest holding so I'll take it I guess LOL
Anything special for this ASTS business update planned for 11/15?
Stimulants or depressants on NVDA earnings next week?
Both
Becky Index hanging on for dear life.
People have ceremonies to renew their vows right?

What if F, GM, VW re-IPO?

If RIVN is 130 bil then I'm sure those three can get better than current caps

TM, HMC and Hyundai? Who cares about those three lol
The battle for 464 wages on.
Any end of day plays?
SNDL

Oatly calls, $12.50’strike, will print large on earnings next week. That is all
Man that massive GE move evaporated fast lol
Stupid AFRM.  Should have sold a lot sooner

Killing it with RIDE, am a super idiot 😆
Dwac, tsla, pypl, sq all need to get with it. 

Ptra is awesome today!!!
I sold PLUG before earnings 🤡
So far my RIDE and BLINK yolos working out. Up 122% and 26%. Hopefully they both crush earnings tonight cuz I can't sell beforehand due to no day trades left ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
I'm setting up stops right now, something doesn't feel right with this
Is the info on PSFE really correct? Do they only have 4 employees?

That can’t be right at all.
Wasn’t looking at PSFE for a while since I sold with loss at $7. What happened to it? What a shithouse of a stock..
They have no idea how to make profit nor how to increase revenue. Don’t touch it for now
Matterport is printing today! Up 7%
Do you accept, cash? Ka-Ching
When did you get a CD player?
Got out of SAVE by the skin of my teeth. GEEZ, i thought reopening play was solid?
It worked in Feb to March....maybe in 2022??
I was hoping holiday travel. But there was an article out warning about how holiday travel will be highly canceled and delayed this year due to labor shortage. So I think you are right, spring break travel maybe.
Spy just got kicked in the nuts
Thinking about going deeper into riot
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
the downside to investing in spy options is it just moves with tesla so if tesla isn’t skying, s&p ain’t moving for shit. which means 12/1 475 is a legit target
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
They say stocks only go up but I’m convinced there’s more pussy sellers than buyers
BA really does not want to go back to 230

If BYND boxes didn't get rained on it'd be at $100 and the forecast doesnt include more rain so
Is the dump in PaySafe justified? Seems like a fraud/bankruptcy dump more than disappointing numbers.
Someone took paysafe out behind the dumpster at Wendy’s for some sloppy top

Whats the $root thesis?
Beat earnings. Its a highly shorted stock.
If it goes up, people buy it, so it goes up, so people buy it
DD: Money is the ROOT of all evil. And it feels real good to be bad >:)  


^(jk, no idea. not even in that one, just wanted to make that pun)
Pfizer still not approved in China, any time soon? Expecting Pfizer stock jump 30% on that

Edit: Fosun a government strongly connected Chinese firm bought the distribution license from Pfizer last year
China will just steal the recipe and name it lebron
> Pfizer is a pharmaceutical company. The Chinese government has banned the import of drugs for profit since 1994, so Pfizer's business in China will be limited at best.
Fosun bought the distribution license from Pfizer long time ago
Both of these things are never happening
China is using Chizer my guy.
Does China even pay for their Windows OS ?
I thought windows were illegal in China?
Don't they already have their own? What the likelihood that they accept a competing product in the market?
China approving a US vaccine when they  have their own. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)

You didn’t sell yet oh my
Im not in it but i know many retards here are as you guys were pumping it a couple of months back
Well now that we know the infrastructure bill was priced in, what’s the next catalyst for SPY? I think it’s going to be sideways until consumer spending increases (Black Friday).
More tapering and interest rate rises are the next catalyst. Aren’t they?
> I think the next catalyst for SPY is a combination of tax reform and infrastructure spending.
Jerome Powell renomination
I think from now on inflation expectations will drive the market.
I agree with you actually.
I'm just waiting for IV to drop for my quarterly ROOT puts to print as always

This infrastructure bill is gonna pass, have a look at JKS. This infrastructure bill is gonna pass, FAN options are cheap. I got them a few months out and nearly ITM because it takes a lot to move a whole ETF.

Would you rather have 10 shares of PSFE or a really tasty sandwich
Shares and ramen bro
get your bidets ready
pls let dis get shrek boners during power hour
Not selling my puts early today. Got a feeling this afternoon and tomorrow are bear days. Got my SOFI profit. Time to ride these QQQ puts.
I have a feeling BLNK is gonna drill, but given my earnings trade history this week, it is certain to moon
Let’s see Grwg finish green
Blink earnings or f45 training earnings
Come on RIOT, break that 40
MARA 🚀

Is Amazon gonna continue to tank? I’m eyeing 3400P
Okay now I seriously need to know what the fuck NEGG is doing
Currently? It's going down :(

Was too scared to check port today. Just got the courage. Recession cancelled! Bears r fuk!
Common PLUG.  One more push.
Anyone playing tsm? Loaded up on April calls seem cheap
honestly love playing channels like this. 108-125-108, rinse and repeat. will probably go one way or another soon and fuck me but until then huzzah!

i would hold off on those leaps until it breaks over 125.
today was eerily flat
How bout now
It's been a decent day to play some quick DASH options as the price has gone back and forth between 227 and 232.
What did you buy today that you wish you waited until EOD to buy?
> I bought a bunch of XMR at $200. I wish I waited until EOD to buy because it is currently trading at $230
Lol
Peace of mind
ROOT is such a shittyy stock.  Negative gross margins. Burns like $150mm of cash per quarter. Only \~6 quarters of cash left. Will have to sell more equity
i approve this message.
May as well add some VXX calls to my SPY puts. Diversify.
When it does the worst during first and last hour that means institutions are selling but retail and day traders are buying.
Spy u absolute POS
Do I grab NVIDIA calls for next week tomorrow or Monday
Wait a couple weeks
buy today before close, sell at open after AH/PM pump. buy more at close friday
Spy is at a third of normal volume and we’re barley holding on to gains…tomorrow looking like a bloodbath

There was a guy that did like a 10 part PSFE dd last week all the same stuff applies he even said that this earnings would be bad so i sold couple days ago gonna hop back in maybe monday
k ty will look at it this night, if you have a link would appreciate it though although i guess if i use the sausages i call fingers i should be able to find on my own

EDIT: TY
Their core product is not growing and they are losing money and market share to better competition. Company is worthless, it wouldn’t crash this hard if the writing wasn’t already on the wall. Take a gamble if you want, but companies with much more legitimate businesses like V and PYPL are sliding as well and those actually have a chance to rebound
Tempted to jump into PSFE as well
i´ll look into it first but y i love falling knifes its just a passion i guess, just today my disca is starting to see green since i catched it after the hwanggammedon
Just trust the process ladies and gents.

Buying puts is a form of subconscious self-sabotage. Know the signs; consider therapy.
Nah man. Made like 250% flipping SPY puts yesterday. You just need to know when to get out... bulls win long term
Burry commenting on Musk calling TSLA stock “overpriced” last year is the most disingenuous BS. 


As if that tweet could possibly be taken as an honest statement.
It is overpriced, doesn’t mean it can’t go up
It might be overpriced but pointing to that tweet as evidence is just absurd. Burry absolutely knows Musk didn’t tweet that because he actually thought the stock was overvalued
Burry has been consistently making the point that tesla is overpriced, and it is, not because of a tweet.
No he specifically cited the fucking tweet, I don’t care what his other claims are, he knows that is bullshit lol.

It weakens his credibility when he adds dumb shit like that to his case. Plenty of non bullshit reasons to say it’s overvalued.
Making a comment on the tweet doesn’t mean much. Anyone who has followed burry long enough knows his view on the matter.
Yea but you know humans. They take things literally all the time anytime.
Musk sold 4.5 million shares so far, only 12.5 more to get to 10% of his 170 million shares.

Selling at the top is bullish.

Wen sell rest?
this friday... he will make a tweet with split post... thats when you sell.
Let’s go TSLA
Bull trap……… it’s just too much

Let’s see

Lol you must really hate money if your still holding TSLA....
If one more boomer analyst says the word metaverse im going to punch a wall
 I genuinely don't get all the positive comments about how Rivian looks. It reminds me of  something cheap Suzuki would make, and then keep in the Japanese market because it's too quirky for the rest of the world.

Tesla cybertruck doesn't do it for me either but BMW iX, Audi eTron and Jaguar iPace are all available now and much more appealing IMO. I suppose they're probably not big and boxy enough for the US buyer.
Maybe it’s because they start at $85k $65.9 and $69.9 lmao
Who cares what you like the general pop likes it
We should respect the people who wear glasses, they spend a lot of money just to see us
A thousand a year is what i spend
Last week I was the fucking man, went from 3k to 14 k this Monday, today I sit at 5k.... I am indeed not the fucking man

I’m done till next week
Pray for me
3k to 5k is 67% gain dude. Don’t sell yourself short
You went from 3k to 5k in a week stfu

I suppose the American thing is to pump and shout and root for 1999 or 2008 all over again?
I mean I bought a straddle so I’m not too worried but I’m also not closing that put this week
Ah yes the bears downvoting
Anyone else remember the debt ceiling crisis?! That’s what China just got out of. Expect the market to rally hard into end of Jan
> remember 

I remember like it was just today
I fucking hated those months
Welcome to heck, bud
We'll hit our debt ceiling in December though iirc. Not in terms of actual money, but they didn't extend the raise beyond December.
Yeah that’s priced in
I don’t think so, but I do think the market dip from that news will be temporary. Going to have some cash on hand end of month. Shit is so retarded but the retarded reaction is usually the best bet.
Spy always inverses logic so I don’t really expect too much of a dip if there’s any

So what TSLA is just not going to $1200? Fuck
Bounced off 1100 will see if she catches 1000$ if we break 1k then I expect to go down to next low of $980. I will be positioning my self long if we see 980$. I think support will be really strong at 1k and 1100 seems to be a sell wall of bear cocks
Tesla is overvalued, Buy Rivian instead.

Tesla has an insane Price to sales ratio. Idk, like 100 or so DYOR.

Rivian can't have a high multiple because they don't have any sales!
How about when everyone buys a Tesla?
TESLA heavy dump coming tomorrow.
Good point - time to buy calls
Yeah..down almost 20% off top wasnt enough for ghey ber?

I think Tesla puts is the way...
You’re prob right but let it get back above 1100 and buy before Elon unloads some more.
Elon probably dumps again at opening

So much selling pressure on Tesla. Sentiment has finally changed and momentum looks dead in its tracks.
Thank god. The world finally realised that Tesla isn’t a trillion dollar company
then banbet
So many sus floor bids.
I’m hoping TSLA shoots to 1200 for no apparent reason 🙏🏻
TSLA....Go Back To $1100 EOD.....
Bears coming out of hibernation
GME 1 year chart is the most bullish thing I've ever seen
Well yeah, if that's the ONLY thing you're ever looking at..I guess
Indeed, highway to tendie town
GME earnings are the most bearish thing I've ever seen

Out of business within 5 years
Clown take, 1000 by march

Is gamestop actually doing anything though?
SPY is going to shit its asshole out in sour hour
I bet it'll go up!! And then it will go down...and then up again...and down...and close where it opened.
There is a dude around here that keeps spreading lots of Covid scare shit and talk about needing boosters, including on other subreddits. 

Delve into his profile and what do you know ? He owns Pfizer stock and is also pushing that and talking about how they can raise prices. 

Piece of shit. Follow the money trail …
hey do you remember when 9 million bot accounts joined the sub to pump AMC and GME?
First of all they came in to tell you sell them and buy fucking silver.  And not even the metal some shitty mine
okay but seriously get your shots
Stop pushing that shit on WSB. It’s a gambling subreddit.
you brought it up mate
Oh you’re Australian. Explains it …
You had a 50/50 chance of guessing where I'm from and you done fucked it up, mate
K you’re from the other prison state.

You can downvote me as much as you want. I care less. One more thing, the rest of the world laughing at the dumb Americans and I can confirm , yes, the Americans are brainwashed and dumb. Enjoy you day. Do not forget your boosters.
We do need boosters - vaccines become heavily  ineffective after 6 months - and I don’t have any vaccine stocks.
Why is the fact that new cases are plummeting not being trumpeted?
Hahah they’re not they are on the rise again. Across Europe too… we stuck with this hoe.

Who’s buying Tesla puts ??
If inflation realization was actually the reason we sold off yesterday, it seems a little unreasonable to think we'd go above yesterday's high again until it's addressed or mitigated in some meaningful way...
  
Let alone the literal day after the news
That would assume the market is logical and we all know how that goes
My Spy calls giving me blue balls
guys tesla is very obviously a bull trap right? like so obvious? please tell me you all see that
Bro stock just rises month after month for past 5 years. What’s your point Dongus?
Bull trap ? Wtf are you smoking. Tsla is a continuous bear trap
Time for me to quit day trading TSLA.  What’s the play today?

TSLA $1200 by Friday?
I still believe elon is gonna sell more and tesla will hit 3 digits again.

Read the sec report. He sold the stocks before the twitter poll. Don't think he is on your side.
So you’re saying he’s on the shorts side…?
I'm saying he is gonna dump more while retail is boosting price up thinking sale is over.
Or he does a private transaction again off-market. Or slowly sells over the coming weeks.
link to sec report? One I saw was for sales on Monday. Let me see your source.

Yes
Next week Rivian market cap will be bigger than Tesla and Apple combined
CLOV is such bullshit; so beats revenue, has progress including the expansion into Georgia, CMS 3.5 stars, and an average cost above even the price target of most cunty anal cyst from BoFA and still less than a dollar off of its historical low?!! I’ll be damned if I sell a share at this ridiculous price; I’ll hold until my grandchildren get my shares.  Seriously less than a dollar off of its historical low; they can suck my dick
Why you're still holding this garbage long after the pump and dump is a great example as to why retailer traders tend to lose money
Oh I assure you you can't make money on CLOV puts either
Selling naked calls was easy money over the summer
Give me one reason it isn’t worth more than its current price; I bought in the 7s not the 28s.
It's worth whatever people will sell it for and that seems to be in the $7 range

Volume is nonexistant. It got pump and dumped months ago. The only people left holding are the ones too dumb to realize what happened and everyone else has moved on.
If there wasn’t any volume there wouldn’t be millions of shorts to keep the stock price low, like the dollar drop after beating estimates and guiding in-line.
You can believe whatever conspiracy theory you want while you watch that garbage trade flat and get crushed by inflation
When all you trade is old meme stocks from about 6 months ago… What the hell were you expecting ?
> The S&P 500 is up 8% year-to-date.
There’s people still holding from that pump, and that contributes to why the average cost is substantially higher than it currently is; this is not failing retail and has expansion of their MA market including the recent one in Georgia, all while the average age of Americans are increasing and their is an overhaul to Medicare.  Based off its historical low, it hasn’t even kept track with the S&P
RIVIAN MOOOONING 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
It’s okay TSLA hush now. You have my permission to die.
Robinhood is down lmao
No it’s not. Is your wifi turned on?
Theyre having login issues
Imagine still using robinhood
I am retard
If GME goes above 210$ things could get interesting. That daily chart is a beauty
If SPY doesn’t start bleeding out soon it’s going to make holding these puts overnight very stressful

1 week ATM SPY Calls look real good right now
I bought mine yesterday @464. Not feeling good about them, but who the fuck knows right now
I do charts and I think we have a short term bump in SPY. I'm a break even guy so who the F knows I agree.
I'm smelling 467-468 at a minimum, but I need that 470-472 area to make up for me being bullish too soon
What about 2 week OTM? I’m looking for some hopium
I'm better with shorter time periods.  I mean if you go OTM for 2 weeks and sell in a week that could work.  Not a bad strat.  I look at leading ETFs and XLK and XLF show a little life still.

Oil just making a small pullback before the climb up to $90 a barrel. We gonna blast you a new anus once the holidays roll in. 🛢📈🚂🚂🚂
Any thoughts on PSFE earnings? Seems like a good play for upward movement
It's been doing nothing since I bought it. Hope it pops up so I can sell my few shares & buy to close my CSP for .01.

Don’t y’all know bout November?! This month gonna heat up and run
BYND - down on a softening of demand, among other factors.  Is that because people tried it, didn't like it, and they are not going to buy it again
Well.. i have a gooood feeling about Rivian. Idk why but yeah
I have a good feeling it’ll go down
Hope you are right and it stays up until puts become available.
I want it to go up to like 200-300 in retard fashion and then open a 100k short position so I dont get IV Crushed
IV will be insane.  I'll prob spread it off or butterfly it.
That's why I said short, I meant short the stock, not buy puts
Canoo part 2?
I have a better feeling about it long term than short, we'll see a post IPO dip which may be a big dip depending on the staying power of this EV bubble

I like that they are focused on the truck/suv/commercial van segment which differentiates them a bit from TSLA, plus those segments are huge domestically.

It already dumped 17% lmao
Oh it's got more to go. IPO lockup is over starting today 10 million shares are now able to be sold
Keep in mind people that papa musky reportedly only sold a third of the block he intended. He pumping to dump again.
tsla +75 day
I don’t get shart sellers. Like who pays for your shart? Must be great salesman.
So what’s the word on BYND? Buy the dip?
Trash for real
Lowered guidance, a couple of their C suite has left recently, their moat's getting smaller. I'd wait a few weeks before buying.
NEIN
No.   I think we are finding out most people would rather eat beans and rice rather than beans and rice chemically manipulated to look like a burger or a chicken tender
I need a 100% overnight hold play baddddd
MRK $85-$90c 1/22 or further.

am i the only one not earning since 2020? i keep fucking hovering around breakeven
Down 165k.
> I am sorry to hear that.
Do you sleep?
Okay now tsla just spilt
BYND average price $212, do I average down?
That fad is quickly fading #wheresthebeef
wait for next earnings. i think $0 is a good buy in price
I think this will be $400 next year once everyone realizes fake meat is better
IT smells like dog shit and tastes like plastic. Puts on BYND
Start buying puts and get out!
I’ll sell a few puts and buy some calls?
Double down? Reevaluate your thesis then do that!
> I'm not going to reevaluate my thesis.
Averaging down only makes sense if you want out sooner. If you still like the company and plan to hold for a while use the capital elsewhere. If you no longer like the company then sell for a loss.
Seems like no one eats meat anymore. I don’t know one person who isn’t a vegan 🤷‍♂️
I like the company too, but their moat is getting smaller (lots of other good plant-based meats are getting popular) and they lowered their guidance. I would personally hold until the dust settles.
PSFE at -21%. Surely it's safe to buy now, right? Right?
Oh, wow. Now -28%
That's what they said yesterday
Any other Army vets turned degenerate gamblers in here?

What you think about 41c?
i’m holding one 41c from earlier in the week, don’t expect it to jump much above like 43-44 but you can still make some money off it imo
Will see how much the 40,41 and 42c are at open

Why is everyone all hung up on PLTR? I have only been trading for about a year so I’m no wizard. But, that stock seems lame compared to all the other opportunities out there. Just curious, why?
It was one of the first meme stocks on WSB and they can’t let it go. It listed around $10 and shot to $30 so people who got in the first day made bank but in reality it’s not worth anywhere near that so it’s just flatlining since then.
Gotcha! Thanks!
Because it's famous.
I don't own it nor have I ever considered owning it, but from what I can remember they have government contracts and do some shit with data analysis. it's probably at it's fair value at this point, but retards think anything they buy should always pump to 1000000s and now there's probably a ton of bagholders. I say all of this without looking at it so, grain of salt .
👊🏻someone needed to say it
So my children don’t have to work
Pltr calls???
It’s going back to 29 ez
Debating myself, as the zoom out looks nice. I saw Cathie has been going in (for better or worse), but they just got downgraded to underperform from the large growth % decline and people doubt they will hit their guidance as they capitalized off of new companies during Covid and feel that the best has passed for that avenue of revenue.
They are trying to shake out the bears and load up for the pump.
Buy Sophie at open
I hoping once people figure out what WISH had to do to barely MEET earnings they'll come to their senses. I guess first look it doesn't seem bad but its deeper than that.
So what to do with a TSLA  11/12 $1095c ? Paid $3,500 for it
Sell it, it expires Friday. Don’t risk it. Needs to shoot extremely higher than 1105 or Theta will rape you
Don’t get to greedy, target 1144
Can't say I'd be confident but your break even isn't far from where we're at. Id hope for a pop and try to get out with as little loss as possible.

fuckin ameripoors amrite!?
bro am i finally about to break even on this shitty SOFI stock???
if tesla splits again i’ll buy a share
Yeah I think I’ll buy a good amount of tesla if she splits again. It’s not bad to have for long term. Imagine In 2030 is going to be so much. It’s almost guaranteed.
Or it could be worth 1/5 in 2030 when there is lots of real competition. 

I’m not saying that is what will happen. But thinking TSLA is a guaranteed long term play is pretty naive. 


I think what will kill the stock is once it stabilizes and all the degenerates holding it get bored. They will want to move into something more exciting. So the price slips. Then more people jump ship. And it keeps going until eventually TSLA is priced appropriately

I guess I was more so saying the run up to 2030 will just keep going. And then allot long term holders will plan to sell around year 2030 and we see your 1/5th price action. Yes I can see it happening like this as well. Definitely though in 2030 or near tesla will be 2.5-10 trillion market cap. Speculation of course. With the announcement of full ai robotics driving, TSLA phone , robots for your house. Uber ai tesla cars. I think shit gonna get wild. They could even start offering giga factories.
So this is what the mind of a TSLA investor looks like.
Probably. If you look at my profile. I’m a gamerstonk investor. I was just speculating
come on lets get this shit moving i want a fat green day today

List the most overpriced stocks in the market I’ll start:

>NET

>SNOW

>DASH

>RIVN
Tsla
TSLA GOOG AAPL MSFT NFLX FB
Lol you’re lumping TSLA in with FAANG? Most of those companies have a P/E between 20-30 which is about the same as it was 10 years ago. Those stocks are actually cheap based on the growth rates they are putting up. For example, GOOG market cap is less than 2x TSLA but they have 5x more revenue.
Ok
AMD sell off incoming T-23 minutes

Eod dump incoming
Seriously though when is the last time SPY went down 5 days straight. Tomorrow has got to be an up day
Good news on ocugen covaxin vaccine. We'll see how that affects the price. Probably do an inverse again.
Why invest money into a company making a vaccine for a disease that has 3 different vaccines already
Buy low, hope to sell high. What other reason is there?

Edit: they don't even make the vaccine. Hahah.

I wish I believed that
Huge shout out the all the military service men/ women on this sub. With out you we wouldn’t be.
You forgot the last part of the sentence: "making big gains on our LMT calls".
Name the last war america fought in that was for something other then bankers wallets.
Agreed, but today isn’t about that.  The soldiers don’t choose where they fight.  Sure, they chose to join.  But we should be grateful they joined so that we weren’t compelled in to service.
Argh
Gross.

*careful they’re listening*
I first listened to Joe Rogan when he had Roxanne on the first time years ago. Stuck around for half a decade and chilled out. Listening again just to see where the podcast is at and Joe has completely sold out and drove off the cliff. Nothing is sacred. What a clown.
Dude Joe Rogan died last year.
RIP
Yup, it got really bad
Big JRE fan here, listened to pretty much every new episode for years. His most recent episodes are very hard to get through, hoping he can find his groove again
He's become a caricature of himself. He won't stop though because he's always getting new listeners via aging. Doesn't mean it's good.
The great thing about podcasts is that you can simply not listen to them if you don't like them
I loved JRE back in the day. Invested a lot of time as a listener and fan. These new episodes are borderline propaganda. Dude needs to check himself.
So don't listen?
RIVIAN $1T Market cap without selling a single car

If you focus on just the car aspect, they're worthless ... If you look beyond that and see their interchangeable chassis and logistics software. You see value.
When u lose hope in spy that’s when u know it’s time to buy more calls
Whenever you say buy more I do the opposite
Alright you’ll be buying calls overpriced af then
SPY is dead this week, my friend
Nah irrational pump from MMs to 467 so put buyers get cucked
I agree. But that’s still dead in my book. MMs are assholes and I wish this sub would unite and fuck them up again like they did with GME
Yeah thats when u buy before it jumps
Not jumping til after thanksgiving. Next week we’ll stay around 468-470 range
Spy inverses logic
Wsb inverses intelligence
That’s why I am buying spy calls while u aren’t
in that case it’ll be dead for the rest of the year.
TSLA has 18m volume compared to the 35m it had yesterday at this time, all I gotta say is you gonna see a big sell off 3pm and 3:45pm

Yes, yes I am vaccinated, let me into the fucking casino!!

Here comes the drop.
That’s it boys we need to bankrupt RH everyone buy puts, they’re screwing over the people again not letting anyone log in, I’m tired of this company’s BS
Ahhh the good ole cycle continues. Just another wave of purging users. There will always be more coming in not listening to the CONSTANT "leave robinhood" comments then getting mad the next time RH has a sustained outage. Its almost clockwork at this point every 2-3 months they will have a giant outage during volatile markets.

I also bought in again earlier this week. Long VALE
Second identical post of this I’ve seen. 

This particular account has lost nothing but “is this a thing?” In response to question comments as far back as I care to go back it’s history. 

Don’t fall for it. Sus as fuck.
Is this a thing?
I'm eyeing it. It is near the bottom of its 52 weeks low. I'll probably sell a poot and see.

Wtf happened to Disney lmaooo
Just giving us poor people a chance to buy some
PTON, DIS, BYND....TSLA
This lacks so many things to complete an idea.
Imagine holding Disney for over a year just to panic sell at the lows 😂 feel so bad for them
Ah , I see. It was a trap.
When is she due?
FB?
TSLA.  NVDA
Oh so you’re just dumb thinking TSLA was going to go to 1300 huh
Well considering I sold a bunch of calls at 1150… no.
No you didn’t haha
https://i.imgur.com/7VASvko.jpg
That’s a lot of buys and no sells. Lol fucking retard
They are credit spreads. There is one sell for each buy, just can’t see them in this screenshot. See the 44 contracts ? 

I want TSLA to stay below 1110 to make my money.

Also, if they were just calls, how do you think I’d be up so much ? It’s because the profit I took from selling the calls.
Ohhh see idk wtf a spread is so I was confused. Thought you meant you just sold calls meaning you had like 1000’s of shares of TSLA. Which is bs because some millionaire would not be arguing on WSB with an autist like myself
Hourly uptrend confirmed on Spy. We may be heading back up to new ath's  by tomorrow
Tsla bulls fuk
Wow tsla really going to $900 or lower wtf
you sound surprised
Anybody else getting dump vibes today? Or is that my bias talking as I hold VXX calls
Eat your fiber.
spy puts have made me so much more than spy calls, shits rigged
fun fact: you're statistically more likely to gain money on shorts and puts than on calls or longs. just random psychology and stuff.
Statistically the inverse of what I do prints
Statistically I get my clock cleaned with SPY puts.  With that said, these 470's I've been buying since the jobs report last week have been working, so far...
AMD just disappointing at this point
Tbh
Huh? Remember when it was at 73$ a few months ago after  the Xilinx crap...ppl these days
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Yeah it rips hard af around earning and then just sucks ass for 3 months
it was a bull trap F's in chat 🪤
Well, time to pump TSLA. Nothing makes sense anymore, so why not? 🚀
is something up with RH??? anyone having issues connecting
everyone apparently
Fakest gayest pump. Stay tuned for a righteous dump.
CRSR is now 34.43% shorted with 16.19 days to cover. Why aren’t we hopping on this!? It’s a good company and share price is undervalued. Also the stock is up 3.30% today. You tell me a good reason why it’s a bad idea, I’ll wait…
this sounds like every post any GME Ape would make.
supply chain ineptitude and past peak revenue, i.e. demand pull forward

but if you get enough apes, sure hop aboard long
I understand but that never stopped anyone when it was the same case for AMC. Shit, theaters were closed and ppl were buying shares
Action on GME?
It's not patriotic for stocks to be down on veterans day.
Bull flag forming, average down the calls
They want you to do that. We tank
ROOT gonna go crazy when shorts cover 🚀
And i almost sold it last week. Thank god.
i dumped my calls last night 😭 but got shares and calls at the dip today and i’m up nicely
I've heard this about so many different stocks
yeah but root has 48% SI second highest SI, and the volume is nuts rn already up 30% on the day the shorts can’t take too much more pressure
How does Nvidia grow into its current marketcap when their production is going to be bottlenecked by samsung and TSMC in the future? Sure metaverse is hot but their CAGR isn't going to be able to meet expectations unlike tesla which are building more factories to meet demands
Everything in this market is based off speculation.
There's speculation... then there's speculation based on nothing but hype
Thats just speculation with extra steps.
Like how the fuck do you become an analyst when you just slap on a price target. They should release their analysis for public to see just how dumb they are.
Because this market is being ran off fake funny money. Nothing matters anymore.
It does matter in the near term because a reality check is coming soon with taper. 6% inflation and 1.5% bond yields are whats propping markets up and it's going to soon disappear pretty quickly in 6 months.
That's the point. Nothing matters because in the end everything is gonna be fucked. Then it's just who is fucked more than the next guy? We'll see later.
Exactly. Imagine if TSMC gets annexed by China. NVDA is then worthless lol
Even if they don't get annexed... vivek arya's PT is based on 30% CAGR... getting frothy as fuck. How the fuck are you gonna get 30% CAGR when you can't ramp production and fighting other companies for wafers.

Even the prosecutor thinks Rittenhouse is innocent. Gtfo
Got in on that Tesla dip yesterday. 15 shares deep now.
I SPY a big green day
New aths today (in my opinion)
Don’t fall for the bull trap. DD for today.
AMC puts on the menu
Taco Bell on my menu today that’s forsure
Not a bad idea
Yum
Telling you right now that puts on Roblox is the way today. I made $4000 yesterday! Its a money printer for puts!
Ceo selling shares is bullish. Read the apes dd 🤡
I’m of the clan retard..apes and our kind doesn’t really mesh
Glad I made a bank from those Ponzi schemes 😉
I’m glad you did.
yet down in premarket. Elon sells his share and its launching. Yeah I got out of AMC. I had 100 41$c that jumped to $45. Sold all my options Sold 2000 shares. Right at 3:58 pm I bought 500p at 39strike.  Yeah... Amc made me rich before you all. AMC reminds me of the "Q" moment. All this DD but nothing happens. All bullshit
Imagine comparing amc to Tesla 😂
Yep one makes money the other sits and hodls waiting for that special day! In 9 month of holding AMC I lost so much money. In 3 weeks with Tesla, AMD, NVDA, IONQ, AMZN, and a few others I made 10 times the money I lost with AMC. Then got smart and sold my AMC right before the earning report. History repeats itself.  I learned from that. So while those fools are holding. I'm buying a Tesla and a New House with plenty of cash left over. Last earning call for AMC the stock dropped like a rock with a rocket pointing down tied to it. Not this time! Nope!
Drs won't save AMC, likely won't save GME either but at least that has a chance.
Yall dumb. It's a normal start the day sell. We won't hit red on large caps.
Bought a little Disney.
Gonna buy a little more Disney later.
Lol WISH trash earnings… spikes 12% 🤣🤣 
This is funny 😆
Imagine investing for fucking dividends. Just facepalm 🤦‍♂️
Imagine having 8 digit port and living just off the dividents. Imagine enjoying life Instead of starring at the candles all day 🤦🏻‍♂️
Imagine having so much money, dividends make up a year's wages. Now you know
why don’t you just buy bonds or get a savings account then? Dividends expose you to the risk of the market whilst not rewarding you (dividend stocks don’t facerip)
There is a real estate company that grew 40% since last year. 70k invested would give you $560 a month.
what’s the name of it? I’m interested now. 

for the sake of the subreddit,l entertainment purposes, I’ll also include a usual autistic response by saying that $70k invested for 500p/m is peanuts
It's a Canadian commercial real estate company called riocan. Ticker rei-un.to. SPG was also nice to get last year
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Donny’s market - limp dicked annualized <15%

Sleepy Joe’s market - rock hard 40% annualized and growing
I think failing to account for the largest governmentally mandated economic shutdown and reopening in modern history might make this statistic somewhat biased.
Nope, president controls the stock market.  That’s why the president traditionally autographs DJIA charts.

Is SPY back on its bullish trend or is she going to bend me over next week?
Bullish trend
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
It looks good right now.  If she doesn't turn today, she will continue to drop through tomorrow and turn early next week.
Middle of each month SPY dips pretty significantly. Usually like the 18th.
If inflation does go to like 15% and the fed has to raise rates to like 3-5% how will the USA pay interest on its debt?
The Feds will call Dave Ramsey for a solution on that debt.
We're gonna need bigger envelopes
We won’t. Which is why the fed never will. They’ll just tell everyone to suck it up and accept a “little” inflation
Inflation is great for debt holders. We pretend to care about inflation because it hurts the wealthy with large bank accounts.

Small peen vs large peen pros and cons:
Large shmeat pros - you feel cool, you can really swing it around, can do poem when you lose all your money from yolo plays 
Cons - dips in the toilet when you poop, most girls can’t handle it, limits pants you can wear unless you want to show odd the bulge, bigger target for attackers who can just bop you in the crotch and you’re done. 

Small shmeat - reverse of all of those. Additional con is that you will be self conscious even though 90% of women won’t care about the size.
Pros. Your mom likes both.
Cons. Your mom like both.
Only the Greeks liked small peens but they were degenerates.
MetaHero anyone?

Playing paysafe before earning is not safe after all. My portfolio is fuckkkkkkkkked
Holy fk an estimated 10.7 million TOST shares available to sell today, the insiders who own those shares bought in pre IPO for $40 or less so roughly $90 million in profit taking expected at open. Their earnings ain't shit when the share float is about to increase by that just today, tomorrow itll increase by another 65 million shares sooooo $640 million in profit taking oooooweeeeee poots gonna print

u plan on buying 0dte is what im hearing?
Maybe eod today. Keeps bleeding though so we'll see if it keeps around 3500 imma buy
seems logistic
Do you think it's worth picking up paysafe leaps with a 5 dollar strike? I'd so why?
Just looked it up, holy hell. 

Well, the word "safe" is in the name so should be fine, maybe.

Is jpow or Biden talking today? This low volume is ominous and🌈
I know this sub hates WISH but look- ceo is out which is good. No Q4 guidance means they’re not expecting much and look at the stock today. Bottom is in. Could go to $10 on good news easily

NEGG is freaking so close to making me rich, she’s fully naked and tied me to the bed, but just keeps blowing air on me all around and won’t touch me. Idk it’s pretty cool but like it tickles so it make me uncomfortable
She gets around, because I'm strapped to the next bed over :)
Makes YOU uncomfortable, I just read this n threw up a lil, you know that back of throat thing.
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a land slide, no escape from the metaverse. Open your eyes, look up at fake skies and REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Did I leave my cheeks wide open picking up Spy puts?
My calls on SPY are getting rammed as well. Theta winning the day
Damn I bought PSFE at $4.40 looking to play the dead cat bounce… now I feel like the bag has gotten heavy already.
Slow market day with the vix hanging in there is a little ominous

Better than dropping 8%

Daily reminder to fomo into whatever is popular at the moment

This new season of Narcos is garbage. They really tried to woke a show about drug traffickers. Ruined the show. Puts on NFLX
Funny thing is woke people are poor so where do these companies think revenue is going to come from catering to them?
What the fuking fuk shit are you doing TSLA????
Dan Harmon: "I've been working on this idea for a show lately where it jumps the shark in the first episode and then it just keeps turning into a more and more ridiculous caricature of itself. But while it's doing that, the character arcs and the overarching mystery of the plot are all centrally connected to a meta narrative about the story getting more and more ridiculous. It's a show about people in a cartoonish world coping with the accelerating levels of cartoonish bullshit they have to put up with as they're increasingly torn between the world of their creators producing the show and that of their audience consuming it. In theory, such a show could never die." 

Justin Roiland: "Dude, sick. I do silly drawings and funny voices, we should team up."

Dan Harmon: "... funny voices, you say? Like what?"
Druuuuuuuuuuuuuuggggssssss
Market wildly rejected Lucid at this same valuation months ago.  No material change has happened in their business, just shipped a car.  Which should be priced in to a $70B company.

It’s just gone up because Tesla did and the bubble has inflated
And rivian is fairly valued
Ok and?
And it means you are trading on sentiment and not fundamentals.  Works until it doesn’t
If you traded on fundamentals the last 3 years you'd be broke
Price targets raised to $60 today too
FIGS V shape recovery
Shorted 100 shares of amd ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
You fucked up fam
At the bottom right?
Nah, today
I mean, at 140
Nope shorted today.
145.5
Very smart. It won't sustain these levels. Just like after last earnings. Just look at the damn RSI. Pullback within the next month.

Only risk is if NVDA kills earnings and AMD trades in sympathy and goes up more next week. The pullback will still happen, but be delayed a bit and it might not dip as far to find  support, so your upside might be limited.
All the large caps are kicking ass this earnings season..I think its time for meme stonks to rule the wall street.
President Manchin says there will be no BBB bill in the near future. Lol
That guy is from West Virginia. I don’t even need to say any bad words to make fun of him, just facts.

elon smash that sell button bro
Any you guys know when Rivian options become available?
> They're not.
Isn't it usually two weeks after IPO?
3 days from going public I think
They need to be put in check and brought back down to earth
I can’t why to buy puts. They’re going to be expensive
Think options are a week after stocks but could be wrong
Bond market is closed today. I bet we dump again tomorrow
I need a powerful hour please

/u/syndromedown-hopesup (1/0) made a bet that NVDA would go to 305.0 when it was 298.49 and it did, congrats gigabrain.
An ETF that inverses Cathie Wood? I need one of them shits for me.

And if your assumption of red tomorrow isn’t a ban bet, I don’t wanna hear it
I already some mine, will get in next week
Wish I would have bought rivian at 100 yesterday 😢
I bought at $112 and boy do I feel like I’m will be holding a heavy bag
BLZE...BLZE...BLZE!!!
Imagine being normal and liking full form women with some curves and being gaslight throughout the whole 90s and 2000s. "Bro! Her ass isn't completely flat! What are you, a chubby chaser?" "Bro, you can't even see her ribs and spine! She's really let herself go"

God, thank you for this new Golden Age of Ass
orca whale fucker right here 🐳
nooooo it's just like the 90's all over agian ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
NEGG, it's okay, you can take your time :)  


  


^(I swear to god once we get home I'm going to beat the shit out of you. Stop making me look bad in front of my friends, you lazy piece of shit, get up there. I made a ban bet and you better not make me lose it or I swear to god...)
NVDA I’ll wait right here for you baby. You rocket when you’re ready
SPY price too high IMO
People who truly believe in the saying "live within your means" have been complicit to staying poor widdle bitches for the rest of their lives.
Yes, I plan to live way in my means, and still spend like crazy. That saying isn't about living like a poor, it's about expanding your means when you don't need to.
Please be a power hour.
Can we get a good fucking power hour today>?
No.
pain tomorrow > pain today
pain forever
If NEGG investors had a fun nickname what would it be
I've had one in mind all day but I do not want to say it
Nice try😂😂
Every job interview should ask "have you ever invested in WISH or SOFI?" and if they answer yes they are instantly eliminated from contention, unless the job is at Wendy's, then it's a requirement.
Can we change the time for the power hour. It really screws up the end of my day.
Is rivian a good play?
I would short if there were shares yet
That’s a keeper in my book.
Bonds selling off , Tech Stocks selling off , Rich people putting their money in commodities , silver/gold/steel/etc.
Cathie needs to do more KO and start buying more TSLA
The manager said he wouldn't call the cops, if I stop bothering the customers
I mean, when has that stopped you before?
Every time I roll up, my cat takes a dump lol
pavlov bro

pavlov
This motherfucker and his cat have some issues to work through
Just shit and roll do it together
Does anyone actually believe in RIVN or is everyone just trading it because sentiment?

Most everyone seems to just think it’s going to go up but is stupid valuation
My RIVN 525 of them just got sold as it triggered at 6% Trailing stop.
That 1200c is looking juicy for tsla
Looking like free money. For whoever sells it.
Let's go, pump all my stocks and crash the rest of them.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
Dow index is full of shitty boomer stocks. Let's add AMD, NVDA, TSLA, Facebook, Amazon, Google and Sofi to Dow.
Apple is genuinely a Boomer stock pretending to be tech company.
Boomers love the same old thing rehashed. Clinging to the past is all they have.
Sourest power hour on record
There have been worse but yeah, pretty stinky out there
Really not sure what Friday or next week will bring. I could see some drilling but still in calls 😜
STOP THE COUNT
I thought after yesterday's sell-off the market retardation would settle down. Nope it bounced right back. CPI confirmed inflation is very bad and no one cares or thinks rates will go up because of jpow's track record of market first
Well ladies and retards, TSLA got a pump of volume. Perhaps an aftermarket selloff?
HERE WE GO WITH THE END OF DAY DRILLING
Bulltrap today
Yea miss the rally you bear turd
idm missing rally just looking at rivian lol ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
If someone wants to make easy 100% than buy Tesla puts!
I don't think anyone is going to take your advice with a name like that.
i'll invert his advice, or I would if i could afford TSLA call premiums
call debit spreads my dude, couple hundred bucks
Limited upside, don't know why you crazies keep pushing debit spreads on high moving stocks.
oh I stay the fuck away from TSLA options, I was just saying it's not $1.5k+ to get into them 


the limited downside is worth it on other tickers. spreads are chill
Not worth it at this point. 1045 rose like $80 with a $8 dip. Fuvk that headache.
Logic of spy dump tomorrow when spy has held gains/been green all day? (Price consolidation)
I think the this week red is the consolidation for a new ath next week
Fridays are generally when new ATH occur
Next friday

Go ahead
Watch out for the $10 increase tomorrow, this guy *knows* it's happening.
Possible. Dems/fed could buy before build back better
It's not possible. But you already knew that.

You just spam the same shit over and over to make yourself feel better.
Look who’s talking
Someone has to call you out on your bullshit.
So does someone for you
I once again ask you to put your money where your mouth is.

Institute a ban bet. You're so confident spy will be close above 475 tomorrow. You've been saying it all week, so bet. You think your little lines mean something, so go ahead and bet. 

Hell, if spy closes above 475 tomorrow I'll take a self imposed permanent ban.
?
I’d be bearish if spy was at yesterdays low by now, but not the case

WISH holders are crazy. Like the CEO just quit and the company said Q4 will be shit.
The CEO quitting is probably the best thing for this stock IMO…also I thought they didn’t issue guidance?
cant go down much more
TSLA green by EOD. And bigly
maybe tmmr
Hahahahahahahahahahaha very sad
WISH is mooning boys. Strap tf in.
Makes no sense either. Weren’t wish earnings dog shit

Why would Thomas the train do such a thing like that ☹️
Bro they buried that one train alive, Thomas and friends are stone cold killers.
That’s actually a prerequisite.
As long as you can watch the next one
Does she still have legs?
Would running a train on the bride be part of my wedding?
Depends.. is she a dime?
Is this a euphemism for something that I don't understand?

LUMINAR LETS MAKE IT HAPPEN, BACK TO 30 COME ON 

FUKING DOG about to short skuweeeez
WISH soaring at open from $4.88 now toward $6. Why? Even SDC is finally dropping.

What the heck is wrong with you guys? There's no squeeze, the company is shit, the ceo himself came out and threw his own product under the bus.

This is crazy. I feel bad for the put holders, they were teased ah yesterday.

It's quite something. Some people just make themselves believe failed zombie companies are successes. Surely some sort of mental decline in progress 

Where were these guys at before SEARS ended up at the OTC?

I’m long on DKNG I think next year it can see a tasty run up
chances Tesla hits 1125 by tomorrow?

Opened 1100 and sold off like a bish. Elon sold off 5B over 2 days. Assuming he started Monday, and he keeps the same pace, he prob won't finish til middle of next week, for a total of 8 trading days.
So.... I'm fucked is what you're saying.
Lmao.. i guess. But the good thing is that we know roughly when he'll stop putting downward pressure on the price.
God damnit. That guy pumping Pfi-zer for that past year must be rich. Oh wait, that was me.
I put chilli powder on her panty, now she's mad.
An Elon tweet would be nice right about now
Should i sell another 10% vote yes or no, strictly follow votes
He’s gonna tweet “no split in the next year” and kill us all
GREEN IS FUCK
Here comes the rip bottom is in
That was the dip. We would be dumping like a mfer right now if it wasn’t

Infa bill won’t be passed with inflation this high. Ask munchkin
Dems run the house/senste. If that wasn’t the case, we would have defaulted on our debt in oct.
Elon Musk himself is dumping on the  delusabull bag holders. Never thought I’d see the day 😂😂😂
Should I buy sofi puts? Got $19,000
Rip here comes the spy dump
Let’s go Tesla

Spy go to $466 pussy you won’t
HOW CAN YOU NOT BUY CALLS ON PSFE AT THIS PRICE ??????
It's gonna melt up EOD. True value play
Down 40 something % percent in a day. Easily will get a decent bounce

Nice little pump
Fuck it, vertical trading
Perpendicular vertical trading. Fuck it
Tik tok... $PENN
Will this be a buy the rumor, sell the news....
Very fair question... I'm betting on Portnoy. CEO of Barstool came out and she backed Dave an hour ago... I think she likes the goods.
I bought the Portnoy dip and Im still down we need it to moon more!
Where is penn?
Small position only up $4500 and rising.
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Jumpdeckchair (1/2) made a bet that SPY would go to inf when it was 464.96 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

He’s not wrong, just early.
over through the shorts! $ROOT
If you’re buying more AMD over XLNX here you’re fucking retarded
Well that's all the DD we need folks.
Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Lol at this guy schillin
Nah you’re just retarded
i cant trade anymore fuck PDT and fuck poor people
Cash account
So fuck yourself then?  Got it.
DIS 165c 11/12 Free money!
Puts on LCID. It’s time. I think that earning report on Monday will dump it too.
I feel that. Wouldn't be quick to bet against them though.
Wth why is that company worth 70b???  😳
It ain’t. And it’s all speculative, they don’t really have any sales yet. Earnings report 11/15
I want to buy some puts bc it only makes sense but in this dumbass market I could see them selling 20 cars instead of 15 (for example) and the market being retarded and thinking wow they exceeded expectations and should be worth way more than 70b!
Yep it’s a risk. But it seems like almost everything dumps after earnings report, regardless if it’s good or bad
I love you AMD
I love u NVDA
PSFE going to get a dead cat bounce tomorrow, right? How are $4 FD calls for tomorrow not free money at 0.33 per?
As far as FDs go, it's a good gamble imo

#BULL GANG LETS CHARGE UP THAT HILL AND KIL DEES DAM BERS!!!!!!!!!!!!
And that Hills Name? >!Hamburger Hill >:)!<
dear rivian,

please do some retarded shit for power hour.

kindly,

me.
SPY go up goddamn
spy +1.2% eod
Hmm
NVDA reverse gamma due to degen option buying
What? so it'll crash?
You tell me. I'm just throwing random predictions around.
No way TSLA runs up more… right? 😫
I think people think Elon finished selling or think Elon selling doesn't affect the stock price. So back to going to the moon!
Tsla not going to the moon anytime soon. Elon still has a lot left to sell. There's gonna be more big dips, I mean what do you think caused the dip this week?
elon start the selling proccess in September before the twitter poll. i think he is done now.
Praying to a god who doesn’t exist for a hard dip at open so I don’t take a loss on these puts.
How's that working for you?
About the same as it always does, starts with prayers ends with tears
Imma pay more in taxes than my total profit for the year bc I can’t stop yoloing 🤡🤡🤡
? Not sure that’s how it works unless you’re counting your daily job income also
You're not the only one lol
retards say TSLA dropped because elon sold and not everyone panic selling. he's only sold 1/3 of what he's going to. today is not a win if this is the case.
He also bought 2 million stock for 6 dollars a piece FYI 😂
How is $5 bill 1/3 when he said he was selling $10bill?
where do you find he sold 5 billion
All over the news?
You stupid degens just don’t get it.
I love how the fanboys just know it’ll go back up once Elon stops selling
>Give me a one-handed Economist. All my economists say 'on hand...', then 'but on the other...

-Harry Truman

All these macroeconomist geniuses keep telling us Fed is pumping trillions into the economy has zero impact on demand.  Biden $1.2T stimulus, just transitory supply chain stuff move along.

Businesses are facing WAY higher expenses and input costs than the 6.2% that we see.  They just can't actually pass it all to people at once.  This is definitely just the beginning.
So what’s the long term play then?  Just all in on indexes?
> This is definitely just the beginning

So you're saying SPY 800 by the end of next year?
Forget S&P 5000, it'll be SPY 5000
While super risky, a massive melt-up is definitely possible before mid next year.  Personally I prefer to play it with calls or options generally.
New froggy fresh song is dope AF.

I knew the hedgies r behind these fake futes pump

Up to u bulls to take it or leave it
Buy the close, sell the open pumpers.
Bulls get out ur Calls at the best price at open
SPY gonna rip all day I feel like
How about no
Happy watching them expire worthless or baghold them
Is this another bull trap?
Who know.
And there spy goes, straight down into the abyss
Back to NVDA calls it is
You know what? Ima say it, fuck the mouse!
Squeezing $WISH on 11/11
SELL OFF HOLY FUCK
Drill team 6 incoming
Tesla to 400?? I would make so much in puts then use all that money to buy it’s stock and delete my app for 30 years
> I would make so much in puts then buy it’s stock and delete my app for 30 years
Pump is fake. Pump is gay. Elon selling every day. Down we go. Way down far. Buying puts? You know we are!
GME one year chart is so beautiful :)
They try so hard to have GME and AMC mirror eachother.

Nobody is falling for it, only 1 of em has "Idiosyncratic risk" to the entire system.

Bears are so screwed today. Just give up already!
You did it, you made them give up. Amazing.
No one on this sub thought SPY would hit $470 after being rock bottom at $427

Therefore inversing everyone and buying more 500C
🤡
Calls on wsb reading comprehension soon, we have to be near bottoming out
NVDA fucks
Damn the US spent the last 20 years blowing up and rebuilding the Middle East while letting our own infrastructure crumble and it’s almost like we are facing the consequences of the military industrial complex

Ok this shit's kinda sus ngl. Close the casino!
Hit me downvote fairies. I'm not scared of your bear shit.
HOLD OUR GROUND BULLS
TSLA, do $1300
I’m sorry. I don’t know that one.
Ok, playing “Do you really want to hurt me “ by Boy George.
The fact that spy and nasdaq are blood green and tsla is barely green tells me a small red day will wipe tsla the fuck out
short term memory loss of yesterday or? 


no horse in this race but lol we just tested that 24hrs ago
That shit was wild. I told tsla will drill down so hard.
Tesla puts are printing ... wish i could buy more

🤡 market
Bond market is closed today. That is why we are mooning.
Taper coming sooner than expected is you chugging CNBC juice.

Fed hasn't said shit.
Market will continue mooning if Jerome will be renominated. Still too early to go bear mode 🌝
Fund managers know this.

Anyone saying otherwise hates money.

EoY rally here we come.
ROOT going to squeeze. Heavily shorted stock!!!
So spy has a sizable dip and then the market has VERY low volume the next day buying up that dip and y’all are bullish? Damn some of y’all are actually retards
Spy ath tomorrow we don’t make the rules here bro
1dte bullish
I mean, the dip isn't being bought. SPY is basically flat today. Likely most traders are on holiday and won't be back till tomorrow. 

November and December are traditionally seen as bullish months because of performance metrics that need to be met. Given the retracement we saw in September, it's unlikely this is the start of a major retracement, as these types of large scale market pullbacks are usually spaced 6 to 8 months apart.
We will see a flash crash at about 1255pm
Can we force a banbet?
eastern time or pacific time?
Both!!! 2x
Elon selling premarket now?
shit is looking too green. this is sus af

I don't get ELY...2 quarters of great earnings and trading 20% lower than it was 5 months ago.
Look into it and lemme know. Been watching it for a year almost.
Double down on tsla puts, I love Elon but he sold only 1% so far out of the 10, everyone assuming he sold 10% already
Think its close to 2-2.5% but yes
Yep lots of room to go down still
Wrong. He sold 20% of the Twitter poll, or 2% of his share holdings, or 0.45% of TSLA.

U can buy dips but not now

Cuz the real dip comes don’t complain u got no cash
Tsla won’t go below 1k all the broke fanboys will buy just to save their daddy
musk dont care ..would be best for him.. he´s dumping fanboys going to hold his bag xD
Spy almost low of day here comes sweep under 464
Sold 20 CSPs of $WISH 5 1/21/21 a month ago for $1.01 each for about $2000 total, just bought to close for $0.61 while $WISH spiked this morning for no reason.

It's only about $800 profit, but we have to enjoy our small victories -- and it's more than most of you retards made on $WISH.

https://ibb.co/dBqtBwt

Sure
Lol. There you go again with your dumb ass confirmation bias chart. Trying to plot from the beginning of the pandemic to now and use that to extrapolate the price next month is literally the dumbest thing I've ever seen on here.
Lmao there still is no tapering/increase in interest rates/no tariffs and soon to be another stimmy 🤡
Market drop tomorrow 😵‍💫
Get that fear mongering horse manure out of here
Guys, if you don’t buy Tesla puts, you are really dump, the downtrend ist there and room to go till easy 800/900
what dates did you buy
15/dec  and 17/march
I'm 100% Cash Gang

Why go cash if you think the market is going up
Don't hold your breath
Let's go Rivian(RIVN)! Let's go! Take us to the moon!🚀🚀🚀 Tesla needs a worthy competitor! 🚘💸💸💸
Those invested, hold the line!
**DEC calls on DISNEY are printing since this morning**
my nov calls i bought at the bottom as well
Paysafe dont look so safe
Is it still SPY $470 EOW!!?!!!
Does Pope Frankie touch little boys?
Does Theta fuck bitches?
What are your thoughts on shorting LCID for earnings next week? The valuation feels ridiculous and what good news could they possibly have?
They wouldn’t be the only EV company with a ridiculous valuation
Bulls call this day a win.
I'd prefer the term dead cat bounce in my case, but sure
Theta calls it Thursday.
It is tho
Dump at open just like I told the idiot bulls, at least I can eat today.
About to eat shit
Dump at open usually means incoming pump, so best of luck to you bruh✌🏻
Come on Tesla get to 1200
Alexa Grace
Y’all missing out on Rivian just like you missed out on Tesla get fucked bears 🐻
There are no options to trade on Rivian yet.  You plebs can trade actual shares if you like, I don't wish to dirty my fingers
Enjoy buying the puts I’ll be selling
The fact that the American experiment has failed is proof that none of us deserve nice things
British monarchy functions pretty well. Put all the executive power in the hands on one family and keep reminding them they’ll be executed if they ever use it - Charles I style.
I think we should have a council of smart people. And I agree with monarchy. 

The fact that AOC is deciding what happens is proof enough we need kings
That's what Jan 6 white lives matter was all about
The new 9/11... Where were you on Jan 6th?

Honestly tell me what you were doing Jan 6th....So traumatic
Good night bulls. Try again tomorrow.
Puts are down but you're happy?

Is this what being a bear looks like now?
I like men
shout it louder sister!
I like men!
If I’m being honest, I can’t stand that SPY never actually dumps. Bulls are so fucking dumb and gay . Look around you, read the room and let it crash already
Suk a gynecomastia titty
Take your own advice and read the room.
Good one pal
>Bulls are so fucking dumb

>read the room 

Zoom out
hey, don't worry, you'll have a few days of red throughout the next year
I know right
Where were you the entire month of September
One month of dips verse how many years of wild undeserving gain?
> A month of dips is equivalent to about nine years worth of wild undeserving gain.
For SPY to really, REALLY dump, the individual stocks of 2-300 companies would have to be getting dumped simultaneously.  Sector rotation isn't going to dump SPY.  Rotation from growth to value isn't going to dump SPY.  Honestly if you want to make bear plays you'll have better luck with QQQ.  Rotation from growth and tech dumps QQQ way harder than SPY, because that's money leaving NASDAQ stocks.
SPY has got me fucked up.

I thought yesterday and the day before were theta days against selling pressure, but futes mooned so hard now I feel like it was just yesterday being a theta day against buying pressure. 

I think today is just another theta day against selling pressure, but it feels so foggy and unclear against the conflicting possibility. I hate how the market overlords are so good at using this opposite day type shit to fuck with my head and paralyze my market sense to make me trade like shit.
You're overthinking it man
Nah, just have to see if I can get through today (and tomorrow?...?) without my portfolio ending up in a dumbass shitty position. Gonna take lots of thought
Holy shit you're retarded, sometimes SPY goes down. We're going into Christmas season soon, it'll go back up. Stop overthinking a couple of bad days
Imagine being so retarded you can't think of a better word than "retarded" to use in the context of insulting someone for being too smart
HAHAHA YOU ACTUALLY THINK YOU SAID SOMETHING INTELLIGENT HAHAHAHA
So which is it? Did I overthink or underthink? Make up your retarded little mind
When did I say you were under thinking? Not surprised your dumbass can't read haha
sdc squeezes today
Nope
I sold so I hope you are wrong
Ouch $PSFE
I really do buy some dumb shit, but that's what will get me rich someday. Oh and sprinkle in some "hard work"
Thank God palantir and Canoo stopped dipping.

Good buy in price
pltr never stops
Tesla up on reports Elon did his stock sale, but he’s not finished selling?
He only sold a small portion.
You lr bugging he sold 10% already
He’s not finished yet. It will be in increments
Yes he is
your whole profile is literally shilling
Today will be the day all people who “knew” the market was going to drop will laugh at those who are losing money. Or vice versa. As usual.

Get out of here with your commie nonsense. Down here in America we work on Veterans Day! Unlike you lazy igloo living monsters.
There's no fence on the north side (yet)
How I have one stock mooning (SOFI) and one stock cratering (PSFE) at the same dam time? Smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
If you have calls on both you will probably still come out ahead.  No biggie.
Imagine having PROG and BYND
Green today and maybe even tomorrow (probably not) but we'll probably see another drop soon. Gamble carefully.
Next week possibly
If green today and tomorrow then next week bleeding
Any reason behind that?
Nope just guessing
Holy shit SOFI only does $230M rev in a quarter? That valuation is retarded
It’s a new company I think

Just dump you cunt.
GME is a pretty tempting short if you short long term. Need to check the interest cost though.
bro you trying to make people lose money with that
let tsla bleed out til EOD then we load up
I’ll load up around 700
Ok, good plan.
I put $500 into 1dte SNDL .50p lmao

Fuck that company. 

Probably won’t print though
Bro weed is priming for a pump you’re dumb
I specifically hate SNDL and I don’t really care if this goes tits up lol
You’re expecting a 30% down move in a day? Get help
It’s a lotto ticket you fucking moron, it’s for fun. 

I’m not “expecting” shit lol.

And yes, a -30% move in a day isn’t unreasonable on a garbage company like SNDL lol.
Giving away $500 is fun! Truly autistic stock hasn’t been near .5 in 10 months
🤷‍♂️ might print, company’s financials and management are horrible and earnings is after hours. 

Don’t care about the $500. It’s $500. It’s gambling. Where do you think you are right now?
There’s a difference between gambling and throwing away money. You’re doing the latter
My guy, the company is valued at 1.5bn and makes 9m/year in revenue. 

It tanking 30% is absolutely a believable scenario. Out of every weed stock on the market SNDL is the outstanding piece of absolute trash. For .01 a contract yes it worth it to buy these puts.
Watch him make a bag after earnings lul
TSLA pump already plz

Idc if i lose money on my tsla puts, as long as the tsla bulls are losing too
This is a very dumb way to look at the market
it's a dumb, and incredibly unhealthy way, to live life in general

Today bulls are going to make so much money.
Despite making up only 7% of the population, veterans commit 8% of the crimes. Curious 🤔

^(This isn't purely a shitpost, I Googled it and veterans do make up 7% of the US adult population but 8% of the incarcerated population apparently)
They deal with mental disorders after being discharged and they're not taken care of by the va. It makes sense
Sign of a government not taking care of its people, perhaps
Totally the problem
Your saying people fighting in meaningless wars and  are kiling other people and are put in life and death situation have difficulty adjusting to society when they come back🤯
Now do the other one
Who makes up the majority of criminals?
Probably wsb users
8% incarcerated does not equal 8% of crimes.
I know, same with the other statistic's supposed reasoning.

The reality is homeless veterans interact with police so much more than financially stable veterans that the police bias against homeless people seems to slightly more than cancel out the police bias in favor of veterans.
Despite humans making up 100% of the population, they commit 100% of the crimes.
What about bears?
If you want downvotes, this is how you get them.
Lol if I wanted downvotes I could do far better. Watch this:

#Hey whoever's reading this, I bet I'm smarter and funnier than you and if you downvoted my joke it's cause you were too retarded to get it. Travis Scott was an inside job by the deep state studying mob mentality in the same vein as MK Ultra. Theta gang controls all prices and they can make it look like there's buying pressure when there's actually selling pressure overall in they market because they can't just let options traders win
Smells like a shit post to me. Do you know any Vets any Active members ?. Have you said that standing in front of them.? 
Our service members do so much for so less...its not only the governments fault it is people that think what they do does not help all of us. And what side of the line do you stand?? 
God bless our Military 
Thank you that is all.
My dude Hippie Moses was a combat veteran but didn't really identify as one, not sure if that counts
I hope you bulls die today.

Lol, psfe halted on dump
Lmfaoo i had a leap for it in case the company just rocketed cuz it was cheap af 😂. Its moving like a penny stock
I'm trying to time the bottom here and get more, huge overreaction here. Algos going crazy.

SPY will stay between $465-$477. Options killer.

I’m going to play SoFi options early and then sell around 11. Just trying to find a good strike
Oh i understand, did you buy puts?  calls? Alot of people are playing SoFi should be good.
I’m going to play SoFi.

I have SPY calls but not for this week.
See what I mean?
Yup hahaha. Market went from green to stagnant. Still young, who knows.
These fuckers are slick. They probably read this subreddit too. Greedy ass pigs.
FR. Time in the market, beats timing the market! To Valhalla my friend
Sell my sofi 11/12 23 calls at open for that IV or hold until tomorrow?
Sell
Depends on your upside for a potential 10-20% gain vs IV spike 

If you would gain 2k by it going to 25-27, but gain more than that in the IV spike, then sell the IV spike. If not then ride it out
If they were mine I'd sell right at open to protect against a fade during the day, but you do you boo boo.
Take the money and buy a longer dated call at a higher strike with some of the money so you can still gain if it continues to run
I’m selling at open
Making money at open is always nice.
ROOT priming to come back down…smh

Salty you bulls.
My TSLA plays are 1) sell 10-15% OTM puts that net premiums at 3-4% max loss. 2) Roll out when puts reach 75% of max gain. 3) Buy TSLA stocks with the gains. Repeat.

Sell NVDA for a loss in case it dumps?
If you're bullish, no. If you're bearish, yes. I'm bearish on this market weakness (not to be confused with a bear. I trade both ways)
I’m long on NVDA. Iv is through the roof. Contracts are not cheap. We need a nice dump honestly. But I think we trade sideway up to earnings. If they report well I think we retest 320 and break seeing high of 380 maybe 400$ end of year. If not we will dump back down to previous lows.
I rolled out my 11/19 calls I had for 300$ sold at 320. Then waited tell yesterday to buy 320 calls expiring Jan 2022. Pretty much took all my profit to buy one. They are not cheap. And not really a good sign to buy when Iv is so high. But I guess you got to pay to play. I’m currently down on this Jan 2022 calls 25%
No bagholders had any good losers for me today so I bet on some shitty luxury travel company I've always missed out on before. Like every time I've wanted to buy calls they would have printed but I said *nah the company is too shit*. Not this time
I’m not tryna hate but honestly PLTR looks like a bear pennant about to drop below support

We talking about the industry of goods of sporting
We are
Give me a hint
It’s up 60% over the last month, that ship has probably sailed unless you’re just looking to collect the dividend
It hasn't sailed. I'm not going to be the idiot that says "it's jUst geTtiNg StArteD" but we have good potential for the 60s at least.
Thinking it's to late to hop in though
if someone sets like a 2000 option sell order at an inflated price does that artificially inflate the option price? my leaps are going up on down days and down on up days and i notice the bid ask is kind of wild regarding the sell orders being super inflated on the down days and back down on the up days
Yeah most brokers base it off the mid price between bid and ask.  So it looks like its worth more but you'll never be able to sell them for that
Yesterday was cool, but, let’s see some real selling.

No current EV range is even close to real world estimates. The EPA allows the manufacturers to audit and label themselves for some reason.

That's good that Ford is under reporting then. But over or under, accuracy is still clearly not there, and the EPA should be doing controlled tests across all manufacturers.
Yep.  Just thinking about this whole deal. Seem a little pricey for me. I’ll stick with Ford.

Whore Lucid calls expensive asfuck. Wanted to take Feb 22 60 C but ain't worth the price.
#Leggings 🍆🤤
Not a fan. The tendency to wear them to cover any and all flaws has led to wearing them with skirts and letting leg hair grow out. You can smash a disappointing ass into them and it look halfway decent, but as soon as they come off everything gonna sag. It's like when a pushup bra comes off and the jugs hit the floor.

Yeah yeah I know. But that drop from 325 and subsequent bearishness hurt.
and after PT raises lmao make it make sense
Just wait. Earnings will get juicy. NVDA will likely trade sideways 290- 305 range on the way up to 17th then if earnings go well BOOM. like Denzel Washington type of BOOM
Is SNDL expected to pop after ER?
Not even slightly.

I remember when I bought my first call too
IV crush baby. they had earnings yesterday

You bought MARA or MARA options?

too bad i got weeklies
Somehow I got drunk and bought 20 WISH calls at $5 for tomorrow. For the past two weeks I spent my days knowing I was going to lose all of it.  Then naturally, as WISH does, it gave me a sense of hope this morning that my ridiculous buy was not in vain. Then now, it is dumping and surely will rocket into the dumpster by tomorrow EOD leaving me with nothing but a big shit sandwich. Fuck you WISH. You dirty whore.

Lol its not on a downward spiral its been chilling between $50 and $55 for 3 weeks
Yeah I guess you're right, I just assumed if something was going to happen, it would be the other day when it shot up to around 54 and some change
It did that today 👀🔥

Plays like PSFE, Z, CHGG, PTON are why don’t want to fuck with earnings anymore. 

Shit is just not worth the risk.
I learned that lesson long time ago. That's why I always sell no matter what. I sold SOFI yesterday. Hurts? Yes, but that's my rule.
I rolled down my short calls earlier in the day but by close they were ATM and I braced for impact. Ended up making basically max profit with buy-write Nov 19 19.5 calls. 

Was very lucky and will not do it again
Cool!
> I'm not sure what you're referring to.
anecdotal but it *feels* like if the trend is downwards into earnings, it pops. If its running up into earnings, it drops.

The real question is who buys it…..ever lol

Down to 0
Imagine shorting a stock that fell 40% in one day. It’s dead. It’s not dying any harder.
It can definitely die harder but just slower the next few days. Might not find its floor til next week.
how reliable is obv divergence? if price go down but obv stay same or go up, seems like a good idea to buy da dip yeah?
vix going back under 20. you know what that means

It's all but a long ass wick now but I don't feel good about this in a bullish stance
This is fairly normal. Somebody fat fingered an order with zero volume.
I have puts for next week and calls for December, I think I should be alright regardless, I just don't know when to get rid of these hedged puts
Spy. For a second there, shit was at 463 again
What's premarket
China is up 2%. Futures are up.
it is a bull trap. SPY should see 445 first
this is the confirmation bias i needed
Someone in here downvoting everything again🤣🤣

The most retarded stock will repeat what GME did last year. Hold on to your butts folks. WISH is going to $420 in January.
Wish is a shit company
So is Game Stop yet here we are.
Today looks like we setting up for the biggest bull trap in history
I don’t know why it is so hard for all you dumb bers to accept yesterday for the dip it was. Calls are the play. New ATH Friday or Monday. Fuck, maybe even today.
Bulls be fucked on job report, because I know.
Bears really are this retarded, aren’t they? Jobs report was released yesterday due to Veterans Day holiday today, dumbass.
Jobs 2.0 bitch baby
Spy just fucking died
No someone exercised
Elon sold $5 billion but Tesla up premarket.

Then again the bond market is closed. Nothing to really drag anything away from stocks
where are you getting the $5 billion number from
Because we knew about the sale, didn’t know when he’d do it. The sell explains the Monday drop which played a big part in how severe the Tuesday drop was. Knowing he sold takes some of the fear out
some retard just said "who buys puts the 2nd red day in a row" like we didn't just have 8 or 9 green days in a row. fucking moron.
We also went red for almost the entire month of September. People here have the memory of a goldfish tho.
LMAO 😭😭
I don't think you understand the context of the market.
I don't think you understand the words context or market.
Fuck my cash and sweep fund didn’t settle for today because today is technically a holiday (veterans day). Thank you troops for saving me from losing money and also fuck you troops for having me lose the opportunity to make money off the meme stonk of the the day BLZE. Jokes aside, thank you for your service. Now one of you vets wanna loan me 10k?
Schwab? I was wondering why my sales from yesterday were sitting in sweep not settled.
Chase…. I might switch over and see if I can get an instant deposit. If you sold Tuesday you won’t get until Saturday…
I'm on Schwab, most options settle overnight. If wed's sales are held because of a bank holiday I'll get it tomorrow.
Bulls dying today derp derp
there are no bulls left. they all died yesterday.
$PENN Leaps? Good risk/reward
I get that a TSLA 400 Put for 2024 is 4k, but how is this not free money? It just needs to move like 20% down in the next 2 years for it to be profitable
Long term puts pretty much dumbest play you can make in this market.
If that's your play it might be more prudent to short the stock itself then cover after it's dropped 20% but if you go for a Long Put LEAP try and buy it when IV is lower and get the premium down
true, i appreciate it. i know nothing is free money, just wanted to ask
Ur better off just shorting the shares directly..
Crash alert crash alert

It’s 11.11

What are the chances wish goes back to 5 dollars today
Lmao
Probably .5 seconds after GME hits 1000/share. I’ll hold my breath though.

Guys yesterday I had a lot of my comments downvoted. Today is a new day I’m gonna get all upvotes I can feel it
  
Edit: guys what did I just say
I upvoted you <3
Aww thanks ❤️
Honestly though, if you're not in GME yet and you think maybe just maybe there's even a small chance these crazy motherfuckers are right

Why wouldn't you grab a share at 210 here just to say fuck it I'm never selling this and see how retarded this could get.

I mean just for shits and gigs right? 

Can't imagine being here and not having any skin in the game for this fucking legend and the greenest stock of the year
just get in BBBY instead ;)
Balls deep in both but mostly GME, lil bro is cool 2 tho but it's not about to revolutionize the entire way securities, collectibles, games and art are traded

lil bro is about to hit a growth spurt
Lmao bro brings politics into a stock forum keep dat shit to yourself
I agree but dislike your comment for your political intent
Ok sorry
You look a little lost bro. This is a sub for making money, not bitching about how you can’t creep on kids anymore.

curious why people on here are anti-dave Portnoy? those who are against, have you heard his side of this rape story? (Penn to 100 mid-22)
He's not entertaining in the least, his on-screen presence is like the human manifestation of high blood pressure
to all the comments.... what is to be said about 1. a person can change - those comments are 5+ years old at this point. 2. barstool has more women in media than 50% of major sports entertainment companies you boomers watch
Literally no one cares. He’s a douche bag but there’s a lot of douche bags. Millions of them. He is probably in the top 1% of douchebags but again, I don’t really spend my time thinking about it.
also makes sense
Wsb is against him because he’s a paper-handed bitch
now this makes sense
Dude has a history of buying the top and then whining about his losses
Even before the rapes

https://www.mediamatters.org/barstool-sports/barstool-sports-cesspool-misogyny-and-bigotry
Please shut up
That he had a good time?
2 comments that make sense, the rest are most likely jealous because they have probably cast many of the same stones
500C 12/31 DD

Many of you don’t understand the market lag in the summer was because of Evergrande/China (second highest GDP) going into a possible reccesion till of last night. We have Build Back Better coming in and Nov/Dec/Jan are the most bullish months. Also the market is still in the COVID bubble look at Nov ROI% vs the average. The COVID bubble isn’t ending till possibly next year. Watch any FED meeting and they have heavy emphasis of Delta Strain.

Therefore a $30 increase by 12/31 is easily achievable.
Not sure why you think the BBB legislation is going to be passed.  It was widely considered DOA even if the infrastructure bill was going to get passed.  It's going to get a scary CBO score and die.
Today Manchin said maybe not until 2022, this thing is 100% done.
Pelosi says she will pass it next week.
Except despite what she thinks, she heads only one of two parts of Congress.  This thing never passes the senate.
With that thinking we would have defaulted on our debt in Oct. did that happen? No.
Defaulting on debt and getting the senate to okay massive new debt spending is two different things.   The CBO score will show it is debt spending and not “paid for” especially with the SALT tax BS. I’m as sure the debt ceiling will be raised again in December as I am that BBB is DOA.
It really isn't. 

This is going to be like in 2009 when all the Democrats came together over healthcare policy, when then Joe Lieberman from Connecticut held the bill hostage because he wanted the "public option" pulled out----so then the rest of the Democrats caved in and did it, and then Lieberman betrayed them by them by still voting it down anyway.
Because Biden isn’t signing the Infa package yet till he passes it.
Manchin could just as easily switch parties and keep getting elected. He doesn't care.

Edit: ALSO, the president has ten days (excluding Sundays) to sign a bill passed by Congress no matter what. Biden can't hold it hostage.
I haven't seen pitchforks here in a while. I think you bought calls a little early, but I don't necessarily think you're wrong. I'm looking at prices to fall for a couple of strikes in December right now. I think we might have another red day ahead of us this week. I'll be banned for a week come Monday, so I can't poke at you again with the stages of grief. Just imagine I'm saying each stage where applicable.
oh jeez, this is embarrassing. I think you misaligned your prime meridian line with capricorn and gemini. The bad news is that your chart is off. The good news is that the love of your life is on the way (and he's cute!)
Inverse WSB you’ll see you are all retarded after x mas
I like how all you predictions so far have been wrong :)
Elon is finished selling don't be a fool. The bottom was already bought and it's up we go. If your still banking on tesla puts you had your chance for the last couple of days. It's over now. Accept it.
He literally didn’t.
Lmaoo ok go.place puts and watch your ass get fucked
Yea he did bro are you dumb
If you are gonna talk shit at least know what you are talking about.. he sold about 25% of what he will sell
> The SEC filing shows he sold about 6% of his holdings.
That's cap lmaooooo
Wait. Its under $1100.. so where is my 1k?
> I will give you the 1k if it goes to $1,100.
When market opens
Im not making a bet with you… im fucking with you but stop posting misinformation. Yes he sold a large amount of stock that last few days. But it is not 10%. Im not saying tesla wont keep ripping, just stop talking nonsense
> You are right. I apologize for my mistake.
He sold 10% bro the bottom is in its raps
You show me right now where he sold 10% already. If you are right ill apologize. Otherwise im banning your ass for a week for being fucking annoying and doubling down on misinformation
I do know what I'm talking about it we can put money up rn cashapp that tesla stock will keep surging from here on out. We bounced off support around 1015 and closed green. Elon even said he sold 10%. Get your facts straight I'm the wrong person to debate with bro. We can go all day but like I said let's put a bag on it. We dip below 1100 I'll send you 1k we stay above 1100 you send me 1k bet ?
Im not saying tesla wont go up… im saying he hasn’t sold 10% yet… go look at the SEC filings…
> I'm not going to look at the SEC filings.

Why does no one understand that the market is inflated right now? Go look at the last month for SPY its 7% the average is 2%. This is 5% over inflated the market will always self correct itself. The next few days will have a lot of red. If you really want to make money buy puts on SPY500 for 11/19 wait till the 18th and collect. Don't check your phone often it will go up and down. I was down 11% yesterday held strong and came out with 1k.  Same thing for today!
This tale is getting old, don't you think?
The market can stay irrational past 11-19
🌈🐻
Everybody knows its inflated...... has been for the past almost year. This doesn't mean its coming down anytime soon. When will YOU understand?? Its been the same fucking narrative since August of 2020. Clown markets make clowns out of people continuing to try to analyze it from traditional perspective. Get with the times boomer.
Hate to say it, but it smells like a huge market correction or even recession is on the near horizon
Hate to say it, but it's been smelling like that for a year
I hate to say it, but you a bitch

Imagine all the money I would have made it I waited one day to buy AMD and NVDA calls 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Sold my AMD 145 calls this morning at a loss…they would have printed with this last pump…$ROPE
Same here. Down 30% on $345 12/10
Down -57% on $335 NVDA 12/3 calls
Are you holding or selling? I’m down more than 50% on 325 11/26.

From January, that was when they locked out the buy button

5-7 bagger by next week, SPY 450P 11/26. Follow seasonality.
SPY has made considerable gains during this period over the past 5 years
damn I think I might be the only person here to make money off $WISH

bought 5k during the initial hype @ ~10 AH and sold in PM next day @ ~16 only to watch it crash back down to $12 by market close. So many bagholders created that week but WISH took me from 70k to 100k and I haven't dipped below 100k ever since. TY WISH 🥰
Weird flex but ok
I also miraculously made money - I bought and sold twice for a profit during the pump and dump, somehow avoiding being a bag holder. Since then I've been buying in the 4's and selling in the 5's, been pretty reliable strategy.
Last year, I was adamantly an "anti masturbation" guy. However, I started taking supplements to boost testosterone and I could masturbate 2 times every day and still have more energy and libido than I did back then.

Lmao.
This NVDA sell-off is going to be brutal. Take them profits while you still can. Jacked to the tits with NVDA 4/14/22 230p contracts.  

EDIT: I'm not saying NVDA reaches 230. I'm saying it'll head that direction enough that my Limit Sell Orders for 20% gains execute and I can move onto my next play. I won't be surprised if there is a large AH shift in price and I can make much more than 20% like the JD 6/17/22 85c that executed this morning for 27% gains. Could've held for more profit but 20%+ gains are gains.
You’re shorting what’s expected to be the next trillion dollar company? Lol good luck bro.
It appears I made the right play. Had wsb agreed with me I would've sold and switched to calls.
Hmmm
You doing spreads or just naked puts?
Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but I didn't write any contracts so they're not Naked Puts, I just purchased 18 NVDA 4/14/22 230p contracts. I believe the price will head in that direction enough that my Limit Sell Order for 20% gains will execute and someone else will purchase the contracts I was holding. I also think there's a good chance there's a sizeable shift in price AH which could result in well over 20% gains.
RIP bulls enjoy the circle jerking

I like Elon 🚀
I really don't like how the candles on SPY are facing sharp resistance around the 50D EMA. The next hour is CRITICAL for the market.
With the bond markets closed, investors don’t really know what to do. So they’re just bouncing around the EMA
Speculation. Do better.
The bond markets are not speculated to be closed. They are closed. The connection between the bond market and stocks is well established.

Yes he's loaded. I like gold but you need a lot of money invested for it to make a difference. Crypto is trash, but its also going straight up so idk. Diversification is key. You never know.
I think some of the other coins have a future but they are clearly overvalued and most won't survive.  Agree BTCO is also trash and has no inherent value IMO.

not that i have the funds... but how hard is to buy larger amounts of call or puts

EG If I was trying to buy 500 calls on PTON before earnings.. could i get them at bid? or would it push to price up? Or 500 PUTS on BYND yesterday?
Say you’re a millionaire and trade on 100x margin - upside potential for huge wins 
Downside potential for bankruptcy and jail for fraud
At the bid?  No.  The ask, maybe, especially if it’s liquid enough.  I’d say 100 for sure, beyond that might move it up.
oh yes sorry meant ask thanks
> You can place a market order for any number of contracts at the current price.
Depends on the volume. You can see open interest when you look at an option.
what does open interest mean? basically the volume  of order book? but its at different prices no?
NEVER market buy options. You will get fucked especially if they're not liquid enough.

Plenty of LP going around where someone got filled on options at 3.00 when they intended to buy around 0.20/0.30 a contract.
Can confirm.  Great way to get fuk

Only limit buys unless the spread is a penny.  Then who gives a shit.  More than that do a limit and if it didnt fill you were too late anyway.

That’s today???? Ohhhh fuck

Thoughts on RIDE seems to be trending on good news??
The dilemma is now; do I take what I’ll make this morning from pre market or do I chance it for a third day in a row? (The first two of which royally fucked me)
UPST earnings dragged my LC down, but SOFI dragged it back up some. Thanks SOFI gang.

Why?
Insider buying
I still don't know who $TELL insulted yesterday for it to get beat down that badly.
Energy no bueno. Btu and tell hurt me
What's the plan with SoFi for those with weekly calls ? Sell right away ? Wait until it moons to $30 tomorrow?
Always sell volatility, first 5 to 15 minutes,
Let someone else get the  Iv crush
How do you get a good price tho. Im worried a market order will sell these at 0.01
Use limit order 
Find a price you comfortable with or fits well with your sell model 
Such as implied movement percent target for stock price With price change times delta
depends on what the momentum looks like, but i'll probably take profits early and then regret it by tomorrow.  its my MO and i dont know how to live without regret
Will sell my cost basis on the $23’s and see what the rest of the week brings.  Upgrades are coming soon - that’ll boost too if it lines up with a green day

If we could go briefly red at about 8.45 so I can load the fuck up that would be great, thanks.

Yes.

If the asset is "JP Morgan stock" or "Blackrock stock", sure.   Anything else of value would be bought up by all the other banks, of which there are many.

Anybody have the AMEX Plat card? Is it worth it?
> Fuck the Plat card.
If you travel or user uber/uber eats it easily pays for itself.

Also the rental car insurance and free phone insurance saves a bit aswell.
I'll be traveling a lot this year, I have three plans for flights before 2022 as well as some car work so the flight points+spending reward is what is attracting me. I'd never use the uber stuff, I have a bad relationship with Uber lol, is there anything else that would make it worth it?
Honestly I don't think the point system is worth it (unless I've just been doing it wrong?). It's always MUCH cheaper for me to just book through Expedia than using the Amex travel concierge, even with the points. 

Also I don't think the point earnings are that great with the platinum card either. I spend about 5k a month on my card and haven't used any of the points in like 5 years and I only have 190k points....which is only enough for one round trip and maybe a week at a resort. 

So for that kinda stuff I don't think it's worth it. But I save more than the annual fee on the things I mentioned. Also they always have random promotions such as covering your Netflix/hulu bill for months at a time. Last year they basically gave me a free $100 to spend at both best buy and target so that alone was $200. Lastly the insurance definitely gives me piece of mind. Not ever having to worry about losing my phone/airpods because they'll replace it for free. A couple years ago my new $2500 macbook was stolen from my bag either on the subway or a restaurant. I filed a claim with Amex a they instantly refunded me the money to buy a new one. That alone is enough to cover the annual bill for like 5 years not including any of the other benefits.
>It's always MUCH cheaper for me to just book through Expedia than using the Amex travel concierge, even with the points.

That's my concern, i've always been a cashback guy because I feel like I would get screwed with the miles through shitty flights and dates just to use the miles. It also wouldn't sit right with me having to spend more on a ticket just so I could get points rather than get the cheapest/best ticket if it meant going directly through the airline/other third party. But those other things you mentioned sound awesome
Yea bro, but even if you don't book with them just the free lunge access alone in airports are worth it. I travel with my girl about 10 times a year and I save atleast $2000 on just the meals/drinks I would have to otherwise buy if not the for the free stuff at the lounge. 

I figured I'd spend about $50 on meals/drinks each way on a round trip flight for each person. So that's about $200 per trip just on the food/drinks I don't have to pay for at lounges. Also it's nice to relax a luxury lounge with luxury seating/bathrooms while waiting for my flights at airports. An added bonus is i can just leave my luggage around my seating area and never have to worry about it for the duration of my stay since the peasants don't get in there so no one messes with anything, also the staff is always keeping an eye on everything aswell. 

And I rent a car each time I travel. The platinum card automatically gives you rental car insurance if you pay with the card. So not having to pay for the expensive (mandatory) rental car insurance alone is worth $200+ every single trip.

So my point is my platinum card easily pays for itself 10 times over every year with the amount of money it saves me even without using the travel point section of it.
I have the Walmart card.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

DIS monthly 5% OTM calls seems to be a sensible and conservative obvious play today. Someone tell me why that would be wrong.
I was just looking at those as well. im just not sure if 1 month out is enough
Yeah true. Got in just about at the bottom today and they’re at 5% profit already. January is probably better to take advantage of Holiday bumps if any.

It's mostly luck but I've been mean green for weeks now. Bought the SNAP dive, had MTTR for a while, lots of NVDA, RBLX, SOFI, and PUBM round out most of my portfolio.

I have the strongest urge to bet against Elon. Probably a bad idea.

Why does it seem like Xbox Series X is so much harder to find but PS5s are reselling for so much more? Does xbox suck that bad now?
No games vs PS5 exclusives. And if you have a PC, you can already pretty much play any xbox game
This. There is absolutely no logical reason to buy an Xbox, now that the Xbox exclusives are on PC too. The only reason to buy a PS5 and a switch are for their console exclusives.
I think it would indicate the opposite. Higher demand means lower supply and higher price.

HTZ is already getting its dick out. The option chain closed the day after IPO for some unanswered reason. If it re-opens, this will go HOOD ipo mode.
Omg psfe what happened

Yo idk know who just bought my PSFE calls for more than what I paid for them…. As the stock drops even more.. 😀😂🤣😂. But good luck 🤣
So many people entered short positions anticipating a bond market sell off tomorrow but it will be tame because of Russia FUD. Biden cares about the market he mentioned it was all time highs when he campaigned for the loser Virginia governor.

Honest question, anyone have any opinions on QYLD?
I have around 1000 shares and every month i buy some shares, will continue to hold them and buy more shares with the dividends.  Boring ass ticker, but nice safe place to put some gains from risky plays that pay off.

Is PYPL a good buy rn or can it go lower?
Both can be true
The incline in NASDAQ stocks corresponds with the double-top decline in Rivian and the very recent red candle in NASDAQ corresponds to a green Rivian candle. Not exactly a smoking gun, but if you were wondering if there was any correlation with the theory that Rivian was taking money out of Index stocks, there you go.

TSLA pump fake af. This ship is still sinking my guy. Got a week until the 🌈 🐻 go back to hibernation
Ya should've hedged
I’ve made 35k trading puts last week and only held 3k overnight so I’m good. But if it moons back to highs I will 100% go short again.
Damn gj. I held on my puts like a dummy and just hedged. Looks like I'll be walking away breakeven. The 20k missed gain kinda stings tho
I feel you. I had 15k more gain yesterday and my finger on the sell button before the huge pump at end of day.  Watched it all go and got out even. Sad times.
The last hour pumped fucked me so hard
So my puts are good? Cuz right now I'm thinking they're down about 30%. Also concerned if Elon sends a tweet it pumps another 5%
Weeklies might be fucked. Those are always a dice roll. I honestly thing this thing will continue down over the next two weeks though.
It will be a small run. I was wrong about Elon. He feeds both the Bulls and bears. Just gives the bulls more treats!
Ahem... still waiting for TSLA breakout. Please papa

Bold predictions.  Do you charge for financial advise 🤔?
Yes
imo the best way to fight this current inflation is more spending and the people who are getting in the way of that spending are actively hurting the economy
How are people with no money supposed to spend more
Stimulus checks?
government spending not people spending silly
while that's a true statement that is definitely not a realistic option. the gov is in a tough debt predicament DUE to over spending. we are in a inflation issue due to the gov printing more money so they can spend due to the debt issue. the best spending would be from the people, but the people are lacking the money. that's the issue we are in
raise the debt ceiling or mint the trillion dollar coin. the debt is not the issue, the arbitrary and pointless debt ceiling is the issue. we are in an inflationary situation *not* because of money printing and deficit spending, but because of supply chain bottlenecks. the people are spending, demand is currently outpacing supply. the best spending would be from the government to increase supply to meet demand, thus decreasing inflation.

edit: in fact, if there had been less money printing and less government spending, inflation would have been so much worse.
Spending on what
infrastructure and capacity
**$BB** will do something today! That's my prediction. Feel free to follow me for more insights.
Not exactly a great sales pitch for me to follow you

Elon sold 10% already like are yall not watching the headlines in the market ???
I see you have some call options expiring tomorrow. 😂
oh yeah, a lot of them, what would this be if it wasn't for weeklies?
I actually don't lmaok
You literally said you have 1260 calls in another comment.
You really doubled down? You arnt right ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Futures fading
So glad I bought 5000 BILI SHARES 1 week ago.
LFG boys and girls!
Are we going downsies

I don’t even have any active trades, yet i feel so anxious. And no idea what the market might do today.
Why do we only give a shit about inflation whenever we talk about it? Like, the only time the market drops is when someone mentions it. So why should we ever give a fuck? I mean like if a news article is the only difference between a +1% $SPY day and a -1% $SPY day then does it really matter that much? I'm retarded just an FYI.


If we can hit 3am and then say "oh shit its 2am now" every October then how much does inflation really matter like
Wait, TSLA went to 1120 in PM, but is below 1100 now?  Elon sold again.  Lol
AH means nothing. Volume is a fraction of daily.
Legit how is AMD this shit
You must be new to ÀMD

Is the market closed all day Friday?
Why would it close this Friday ? If you’re talking about Black Friday then it might be closed
Got my dates mixed up. Thanks though.
I guess we're in selling pressure but we keep having theta days, today theta gang will do a big pump for Veteran's day, tomorrow they'll pump again just to make the most of the weekly momentum, and then Monday is pivot point where it can either pump for theta decay one last time or more likely all the selling pressure built up over the weekend can be let out of the cage at once. So for me I guess it'll be a call on SPXS today, another one tomorrow, and maybe a SPY put on Monday. 

^(Don't take this as advice, I have openly admitted SPY has got me fucked up today, this is me testing the strength of my psychic ability. According to what I know from past testing, I should be wrong on everything I just said, but if I'm finally getting strong enough to overcome interference on days like this, I'll be right. Saving comment for record so that I can't have selective memory in hindsight)

I wouldn’t go all cash. But maybe 40%
Yeah…I’m keeping all my blue chips tho…I may sell Apple
Yeah I’d agree I might keep some to see what happens with that apple car thing but who knows.  I’m raising available cash position but I’m scared to get all the way out….my fear is always just making .01 in my savings while watching the market make 28% this year lol who knows how long the markets can stay irrational don’t want to miss out but don’t want to get burned.

[deleted]
Is that when you buy and sell quick like day trading?
tsla calls? seems too obvious maybe
Depends, is that 2k just funny money? If so then you can have some fun and bet on some stocks of companies you like/use. If that money is your livelihood then stick it in an index fund or ETF. There are some good ones with great returns. The majority of people here are playing dice with their life savings through puts and calls, and 2k is not enough to see any relevant gain following that strat.
Thank you. Yea, my plan is to just start an investment and add to it over time. It is long term, for sure. I was decided on ETFs. I think I should do tech and real estate ETFs. You think I’m going in the right direction here?

ok i've been looking through elon's filing (too lazy to add up all the stocks but he's got millions more to go), and he's at least not dumb. he def decreased the amount of shares when price went close to a 1000. Most of us here would be panic selling when price dips below 1000 lol. Matter of fact he only sold 400 right at 1000.
Anyone have any idea as to about what the SOFI 25 calls expiring tomorrow will open up at?
You’re facing both IV crush and theta today. 

Good luck

How to determine if capital gains are short/long term? I understand that long term must be held for a year, but if I automatically invest in a mutual fund monthly will I ever be able to take long term gains, or will that year timer reset every time I add funds?
Step one: dont buy a mutual fund.
Depends if you use LIFO or FIFO when filing taxes, and how much you sell/withdraw
Shares you've held longer than a year are long term.  Your broker, if they're competent, keep track of it.
People live with 30% inflation in emerging countries did you faks think about that

Yeah looks bullish. There is a lot of selling happening at 42+ but the good earnings report and the volume ramp up looks like it has potential to break through. It will be a rocky road through 42 but if you have conviction in the stock, I would hold

Can you throw me some tickers?
just kill urself $SPY

Could have sold a strangle yesterday on SPY one strike OTM and made decent gains. That's what I meant by "go short volatility".

By yesterday, I meant after lunch.
Nvda is trying hard
SPY ended at LoD 🤣
The next Daily Discussion thread is [here](https://redd.it/qr41y7)
There were actually TSLA millionaires completely undiversified posting last week their big gains. Every single one of them is down six figures this week alone.


Not only did they not post loss porn, they deleted their gains porn. Upvote every loss porn because those guys are the real heroes, in a world of social media where everyone only tries to keep up a facade of success.
Ate some shrooms before market opens today.

Looking for patterns and fibbonochis. Gonna break out the crayons later.
Market really goes from heaven fun making tendies to complete hell losing all your monthly gains being depressed and hating yourself in 2 days in a fucking snap .
Imagine a trillion dollar company trading like a penny stock lmao
Two months ago, I had a bat in my apartment.  Took me like a two weeks to get him to leave.  Now I kinda miss the little guy.
Imagine thinking we won’t be green after CPI print like every other time.
I just don’t fit the bill for bull gang, bear gang, or theta gang. I’m more of a “needs to stop trading and losing all of my income” gang
The only time my portfolio grows is when I deposit money in Robinhood...
Cant wait for the JPow AI in 2095 to keep saying inflation is transitory while I sip a $739 latte
There's no inflation in Ba Sing Se
Jesus fucking Christ, I was going to buy a house with my Ford winnings, now my Ford is my house.
Quit alcohol, day 4
I wonder what Ja Rule thinks about all this
I hope inflation doesn’t get crazy. Both my parents are on fixed pensions.
You honestly think America is going to release bad CPI and make us look like idiots in front of all of our friends? Never bet against America

Somewhere out there a boomer has been holding Ford since 2001, and just broke even
It was announced earlier today that Rivian will also be debuting it's brand matching line of luggage.

/u/britishball (1/0) made a bet that RIOT would go to 40.0 when it was 37.55 and it did, congrats you fuckin nerd.

wsb user with 1k:

“i did this.”
Rivian CEO on Bloomberg already bitching about supply chains. 

Easy buddy, wait until you get the money.
Ford 40$ by December
Yesterday: "I'll double my money on these calls and cash out"

Today: "I could've paid off my credit card with these losses"
Let Rivian trade you cowards!
Rivian opening with a $100B+ market cap, which is larger than Ford. Absolutely dumb AF.
How I got to $100k this year: 


Step 1. Started with $200k


Step 2. Lost half due to poor trading.
SPY down -0.7%, most stonks down -5%, WSB down -78%.
5 years of gains gone in 2 days
I bought high and sold low. Winning!
If CPI data bad government will fix it and provide a new number .
$F Dec calls. According to commercials, it's incredibly common to gift cars with a giant bow on them for Christmas.

When rivian so I can lose money
I don’t mean to sound dramatic but I need someone to shoot me in the face with a bazooka
Is Travis Scott performing at the nyse?
Ford about to put out a Twitter poll asking if they should sell rivian
Rivian sure to make some *long term investors* today

Thank god I lost all that money to protect it from inflation
Cathie Wood bought 854742 shares of Palantir worth $21,368,550 in yesterdays trading session.

At close, she owned $584.73m in PLTR.

That position is now worth $552,277,485.

No big deal, just a casual $32,000,000 loss overnight.

Watch her sell for a loss today like she sold Zillow the day after buying the dip

If she sold right after the army contract, the position would have been worth $680,772,070.10.

Nothing like losing $128,494,585.10 on paper in 30 days.

She should be a mod at /r/wallstreetbets
I am downgrading my portfolio to underperform.
*YOUTUBE TO HIDE `DISLIKE' COUNTS ON VIDEOS TO REDUCE HARASSMENT

Wtf lol
Trillion dollar companies should not be moving like a penny stock lol
PLTR is such a whore
In exactly 2 minutes I will officially be bagholding
everyone is going to expect markets to be blood red today from bad job and CPI numbers.....so I'm betting it will not be blood red.
Rivian is gonna pull a COIN. 

Open at 120. Pump to 200. Dump to 80. Close at 60
SPY up 1%: only half of stocks are green

SPY down -0.1%: everything is blood red
Can’t have a shitty IPO if you never open.
People think market is down because of rivian is not trading yet. 

They think market will go green after rivian trading is on.

I underestimated the stupidity here. Holy shit. This is next level...
The invisible hand is too busy jacking-off billionaires.....
AMD needs to stop collaborate and listen and come back with a brand new rendition going the other fucking way.
Turns out having several different long positions in tech does not qualify as diversification
SPY 470 calls at open seem extremely retarded. Will probably print for that reason
lol over a month of slow gains down the toilet in just over 24 hours
Y’all ever wake up from a trading nightmare when you held a big position overnight?
RIP my account. GGs boys
SPY 472 EOD gap up please god
No inflation I can still buy a dime bag for $10

Blew up my account. Taking a break for a while. Godspeed
Ford's stake in RIVN is going to be worth more than the rest of Ford. I see no issue with this.
Rivian definitely knows how to hype itself up
Rivian price already climbing
Bought my first ever options with PLTR calls yesterday and I am already down 35%...
Who has lost more than 30k in the market and makes 40k a year🙋🏻‍♂️

Burry claiming bull market is over and tesla is overvalued

Hes really hyped in twitter that his $700 strike puts are now only down 98% instead of 99%
Imagine Elon just tweets "seems there was a slight miscommunication recently that I wasn't aware of until now - we meant to say Tesla is acquiring Hertz"
Gme + LRc go brrrrrrrrrr
Back to being a depressed retard yoloing into weeklies at the exact fucking top
The amount of stop losses getting triggered at $1000 is probably huge...
If I see red I'm turning off until tomorrow
No matter how much research you do on an earnings play, it’s always a 50/50 for working
#CRAMER: HEY IM CRAMER!

Me: HEY IM BROKE!
Congrats to anyone that held TESLA puts ,My god.
interesting how all this stuff was obvious all along now, but not fifteen minutes ago
I think it’s flattering that a market with hundreds of billions of dollars in volume every day takes the time to personally screw me on every single trade
I have 23 open positions.

I don't have a single position that isn't up or down less than 10% today 

But overall I'm up 0.12%

Almost perfectly balanced as all things should be.
Welp guess i need a job now. See ya guys next year.
Just going to invent a fake company called like, I don't know, Expensify or something.

There are no tariffs. SPY $470+ today
Inflation data in 5 minutes! Better not be fake and gay!
Don't kid yourself. Everything is bullish, even bad CPI numbers.
Inflation is 100% Transitory - J. Powell , and if you fire me I will make it permanent
The dip will be bought
Oh boy, I’m getting a 10k+ haircut at the opening bell.
After all the puts are sold at a high premium after market open the big boys gonna do the old switcheroo and make the calls go up bigly.
im about to absolutely print… just negatively
Why do I wake up so excited for the market open just to have red dildos shoved up my ass
“lol who cares if half the population can’t afford necessities. to the fucking moon.”
This market is retarded af.

My chipotle bowl looked a lot smaller today. Inflation sucks 😡
LMFAO PLTR.....You dumb fukin son-of-a-bitch lazy piece of cunt shit!!!!
Rivian now announcing they will do a stock split tomorrow following today's valuation
Buy Rivian at 115 sell at 50. Thats how you trade like a pro.
I didn't know Rivian makes electric drills
Why do I have to live through the second Great Depression?
If inflation is real and not fake how come we're not seeing inflation in stock prices today?
I have until 12/17 for FB to stop being a little bitch

Hahahahha everytime I buy calls on a red day the next day is worse if I hold puts I get blown the fuck out with huge green dildos
inflation is a meme at this point

feels like CPI could read 20% and nothing would change
Must. Get. Inflation. To. 6.9%

Lol people get in a stocks that’s ran 40% this month and get mad when it dips 5 come on 🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
Rivian is the biggest tease since PS5 shipments
rivian seems to have forgotten they were supposed to start trading today

I am become retard, destroyer of wealth…
Guy in the stall next to me is bawling his eyes out and shitting loudly
Back to the dick sucking factory
No idea why I play this game. 

I hold calls…stock drops until I sell. 

I hold puts…stock rips until I sell. 

I AM the market maker.
Gains are transitory
This is where we are as a society: waiting for word out of China on whether or not a fake real estate company will pay some interest on its debt so that the world economy doesn't crater.
Literally look at a 1Y chart. 

Do you see how we *repeatedly* go on a big rally, dip between 3-10%, go on a big rally? 

All you need to do is decide “Do I think the pattern is going to *repeat* or *not repeat*. 

That’s it.
This is it: The day WISH falls below $1.5 billion market cap, and highly regarded apes have to STFU about it forever.
When I die and God asks me why I deserve to be in Heaven, I'm going to tell him I'm down 99% after the greatest bull market run in market history. He will let me in after knowing I've suffered enough.
We eatin ice cube sandwiches tonight boys
Up wayyyy too early, extra coffee today ☕️

But will it be the bulls or bears,

Who throw themselves down the stairs.
Clean up on isle 4, TSLA blood all over the place. Close to breaking 1000. FUCK ME
The 2 guys on CNBC are the oldest living men on planet earth. They haven’t gotten a boner since 1982. They eat Ovaltine for breakfast. I’m confident their closing statement will be “get off my lawn”.
You ever thought you were buying a dip and then the stock nose dives😀
Inflation at 0.2% as CPI assumes everyone has transitioned to subsistence farming
Man up retards, CPI doesn’t mean anything we’re gonna be green either way, what haven’t you learned from the past yr
TRANSITORY
The $2k I lost this past week now has less value. Thanks inflation!
At a low point both financially and mentally
The amount of buying the dip going on is insane, almost impressive
If all of us could just be SPY bulls for the next 5 hours, that'd be much appreciated. My student loans aren't going to pay themselves
Tesla is now making more bears homeless then global warming
Have to admit something guys. Even after I deleted my trading app and cleared my cache my broker is still calling and asking me to cover my negative balance.

Any ideas what my next move should be?

What?
Fords buttfucking me rn. Come on get up to 21!
Rivian not gonna beat tesla
WTF $F. Go back up
The fed in 2018: Inflation is 1.7% we’re going to raise rates four times this year.


The fed now: Inflation is 6.2% rates are staying at 0
Fyre festival coordinators must be on Rivian's board
The RIVIAN ipo will absolutely mark the top of the market
Ford owns 12% of Rivian. Rivian's valuation has doubled since yesterday. Ford is down 1.8%. I can't tell if I'm the idiot or everyone else is.
Ford you fucking bastard!

Jesus fucking Christ all my gains in the last month, fucked
Kinda wish a burglar would just break into my house and shoot me
My spy calls are blood red so I bought my first put.

Immediately fucking dropped 20% but my calls didn’t move a penny

I hate this market ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Thanks to PayPal I am now a PoorPal
Me two weeks ago: I'm never trying to time the market ever again

Me last week: Let's throw a couple grand into the market and see what happens

Me Monday: Wow I'm doing so well!

Me today: I'm never trying to time the market ever again
I sold my tesla calls at a loss and bought puts. Then it pumped passed where my calls broke even. I'm now down about 13k this week. I hate myself. I hate my life.
I panicked and bought a spy put to hedge by calls😂 now I'm losing both ways!

Of course I finally get deep in weeklies at the very end of the AMD and NVDA run. Yesterday I hold and they fall all day. But other days I sold they fucking rip 10-15%. Just bad fuckin luck
How much money do you have to have in your bank account before you own the bank?  Only ask because I have almost $800 in savings so it should be soon for me I think.
Want to help kids not be depressed, give them money and a shot at ever owning assets instead of fake shit programs that make you feel better about destroying the American dream.
By the sounds of this sub, I would say 90% are losing money today. I know I am.
What if Elon didn’t sell his shares yet 🤔 and TSLA is going to drop even more
Post nut clarity hits. Its clear Tesla calls is the play

It's illegal to have 3 red days in a row
Inflation will fuck over the working class until the fed raises interest rates, causing economic contraction that will also fuck over the working class.
Today fucking killed me bruh.  FFUUCCKKKKKKK

Good news! Just sold all my calls for a loss, so the market is sure to rally real soon

That’s how fast they make their product. And they’re valued above Ford? Lol.

Bulls expect 1% everyday, I’m gay tho
I'm never going to financially recover from this.
LESSON LEARNED THIS WEEK: 

Set a goal and cash out, and ditch bad stocks immediately. 

Trying to find the find “the top” is a fools errand. 

I’m still in the green this week (by the fucking skin of my teeth) but it could have been greener. 

Best of luck this week. Damn.
I gave my wife a glue stick instead of lipstick by accident. 

She’s still not talking to me.
Seeing everyone in the sub say that they bought the dip makes me feel great about holding my spy puts
I blew up my account today, nice
Hell ya TSLA. Now I’m only down 35% lol
Fake pump to get me more confused?
Green the rest of the year. 

My DD? I’m down overall 80% since Tuesday so I really need it to.
Don't buy puts on SPY. Wait and average down LEAP calls tomorrow and friday.
Yo what the actual fuck. How did Tesla do this today? How was that even possible on a trillion dollar fucking company?
Gonna have a nice bowl of water for dinner tonight 👌
once saw an ad for impossible meatballs or beyond meatballs or something like that and it said "meatballs without the meat!"

and that, my friends, is just balls.
Rip to the guy who posted yesterday that he lost 26k on Tesla calls in the last two days and then bought puts yesterday before close with the rest of his balance. You really had the worst timing ever
Inflation ridiculously high, Evergrande in big trouble again. Spy aint going to 500 eoy 

Spy 550 eoy
 Hopefully the CPI numbers come out bad so we can moon today
Entire market follows Tsla now we’re all sorts of fucked
Futures red mean nothing till CPI comes out
So much for my EOD SPY call FDs I bought yesterday.
[deleted]
NVDA trying to destroy my entire trading account. Please go the other way
Cathie’s about to hit the street after PLTR free falling. I’m also available and ready Ms Woods
Did we fuck up by buying calls for SPY above 470?
Oh my god. My poor NVDA calls
Morning dump confirmed. One big solid log. 2 wipes. Bullish
Where's the guy who told me ford would never go anywhere?
Dear sweet little baby Jesus, please pump my bags. I've been a good boy all year.

Amen
Sorry guys. It's my fault and not elon. I bought one spy calls and the whole market crashed.
We are at the bottom of a year long ascending channel. Green by open.
Wont buy tesla till its at least $1300.
HEY IM CRAMERICA WELCOME TO MAD MONEY WELCOME TO CRACK
A month of PLTR gains gone in 2 days lol. Officially negative by 1%
I like CEOs who don't tweet or use social media at all.
Rotation out of tech stocks into soft white wheat🌾
Haven’t touched options since bloody March. Figures I would touch them again during bloody November now also
Sofi dumping. I thought girls didnt poop
If you don’t buy the dip, you don’t feel the rip.   
It’s a buy day boys
I'm not selling SHIT. Not my Meta calls, not my SPY calls, nor my Carnival calls. They aren't shaking me out again after a few red days, I learned my lesson MFs
F about to flex some retard strength. Fuck inflation.
Lmaooo I think it’s hilarious that the million dollar TSLA short guy closed out his position a day before the crash started.
Im glad all the apes went to their own subs. Wsb is slowly recovering. It also helps that the new guys got tired of losing money
Ford is about to blow it's top with the Rivian IPO. I can honestly see Ford above 21 today, crazy
How options work: Congrats you picked right! The market disagrees.
Some of you don't have SPY 12/31 500c and it shows
Pro tip: use multiple brokers for your accounts. If said account is REKT just don’t open the app and use another app 🤡
Interest rates and gas prices are going to go up, up, up. What a mess. Should have started taper earlier and ended the 'free' covid money sooner.
30k into ford 21C jan
Can AMD
MOON?
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/tumadreunpoco2 (1/1) made a bet that WISH would go to 6.5 when it was 6.0146 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Ever since I joined thetagang my shares are down 15% but I make $38 every week
Peak 2021: Inflation is trans
Ford could end the day with 20% of its market cap in Rivian stock
F needs to move now
Reminder. Don't let anyone ruin your day. 

Be a man and ruin it yourself ☝🏼
Super gay day
Mr. Powell, CPI rose to 6.2% today.  “Prepare the printers, we can do better”
ok, im leaving the house for a 10min walk to the office. assume Riiviian will starting trading while im away.
inflation? 🤷‍♀️ 

evergrande? 🤷‍♀️ 

debt market? 🤷‍♀️ 

asset bubbles? 🤷‍♀️ 


investors very good at shrugging
F needs to do something
damn rivian is going to blast off today. aalready at 120 probably closes above $200
All these recent IPOs are straight up scams run by VCs. They bid the private market valuations up to absolutely retarded levels that make no sense and then do an IPO where they sell a tiny portion of the outstanding shares keeping the float very small and easy to manipulate then once all the gullible retailers are in and have bid it up even higher they unload the rest of the shares.
I might be dating myself here but I can remember a time when a company actually made something that a lot of people bought and enjoyed and then went public.
This was a bad week to try weeklies
Ford, you okay buddy?
elon's brother wears a fucking cowboy hat what a dork
F wont stop drilling holy shit stop
LCID and F baby!
!banbet sofi 25 2d
Just found out when you hide someone's comment it only hides it from yourself. Smh
Bank of America keeps emailing me to open a Savings Account, like I can't live without that 0.30% Annual Interest Rate
Made a quick $500 on rivian. Probably gonna moon but I don’t wanna hold them bags I’m out
Who the fuck is buying a 115 dollar bag?  Show yourself
The market is rotating out of my portfolio.
FORD DIP WTF
F I’m gonna hold my calls, but pls go back to 20
In order for me to Build Back Better I must first wreck my account
Seriously this bitch just keeps dipping wtf
I DECLARE BANKRUPTCCYYYYY!!!
Just got Ass blasted by F calls…
I've made more cars than Rivian and I don't even know how to make cars
This morning Got iced coffee in Starbucks and the system went down, and they said it’s on the house, saved $4, was happy to start day winning. It went down the hill from there, fucking day
Whole ass account down 55% from Monday 🍺
Do not let the Fed distract you from the fact that today is the 46th anniversary of the Edmund Fitzgerald sinking on Lake Superior, killing her whole crew in the process.

If you aren’t familiar with the story: let my good Canadian friend Gordon fill you in. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9vST6hVRj2A
Lol spy ceo said n word
wtf why is F down 4%?

Fucking hell I'm broke. Thanks Obama

*Travis Scott autotuned moaning from a platform standing over SPY chart sounds*
I had a thesis.  I entered the position.  I got impatient and sold.  The thesis played out exactly the way I thought it would. I re-check the ticker many times to fantasize about the gains I would have had if I would have had more patience. 

&#x200B;

This was a 3-day play.
Well crap I’m now a long term investor in ford, square and Facebook.
Stop fighting the trend, this isn't some team sport where you need to pick yourself up through a locker room motivational speech and get back in the game. You can change to whichever is winning at any time. 


Unless your account is under 25k of course, and the government needs to 'protect you' from yourself 🤡
Up 6k to down 12K, lmao ducking retard
Well I’m about to be banned for a week, see you retards later
This market is like a young and sexy crack whore, you think you gonna have a great time, but it always ends up with clap and a stolen wallet…🤬
Tesla under 1000 EOD

JUST JACKED MYSELF TO THE TITS IN 0 DTE SPY 465Cs PRAY FOR ME BOYS
50k into sofi before earnings 😍
so my 11/12 462 SPY puts that I sold for a massive loss wouldve printed. good to know
SPY aint foolin nobody - this ends in blood. I know this because I have calls and the market wouldn't be working properly if I was allowed to profit. Stick to your puts
Good god almighty. I'm broken in half
Pay for full tank of gas? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)

Pay for 0 dte spy calls? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Who bought the dip
Who's expecting PYPL to rip? I am based on 2 comments I've seen on here
Fuck the market, I’m now officially a shitty gay ass bear
Man I woke up late, I wonder how my SPY calls are doing
From up 200% to down 20% I will remain to hold these TSLA puts until these retards understand this is not a good time to buy
so the markets gonna go up tomorrow, right? right?
Bullish on Disney earnings. Don’t fuck with the mouse 🐭
Only liquor can fix this
Tsla bears in shambles yet again
 u/dhsmatt2 Mattress King shows that you should never get obsess with a stock that made you money , he would be up bigly if he put it in NVDA/AMD/etc. but instead he kept going back to a retarded mattress company
NVDA WEEKLY BAGHOLDER. SOMEONE SHOOT ME
*fluffs newspaper bed*
Interest rates perpetually under CPI is an infinite money hack. Let me borrow $10mil at 1% interest rate and I’ll dump it in the market. Rinse and repeat. No risk at all.
Red day? I should just stay in bed and jerk all day
Sometimes you got to stop listening to retards 

And be your own retard!


LETS GO RIVN
Spending 10min to try and research a play to double my money. Should work out.
If tesla go below 1k, it will be 900. Bounce to 950
He realizes it could be a bear trap, but bought puts anyway. 🙃
Will there be inflation in the metaverse?
Next week is going to be boring in the Daily Threads.

Only a few bulls, mostly bears, and corpses to walk over. 

Hmmmf *kicks rocks*
Won't higher inflation means more people will enter the stock market? please enlighten me
We haven’t seen the worst yet. November and December will be worse due to the holiday season. 

Fed’s hand is going to be forced to be more hawkish sooner than everyone expected. 

I don’t see how they can keep pushing the transitory bullshit.
Burry must be masturbating right now![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
WHY ON EARTH DO I HAVE NVDA FUCKIN WEEKLIES 😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
cpi, jobs numbers, bond yields blah blah blah it’s all a fugazi. just keep buying calls with enough time on them
Jpow: Fuck the poor ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
FUCK YEAH EVERYTHING IS RED - oh wait, I have DASH puts. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
GREEN BY OPEN
CPI numbers come in

The market be like: 

_Okay, alright, that's fine, okay_
No fun being down 18k and the market hasn't even opened yet. GUH
More $pypl calls ✊
^mommy ^I'm ^scared
Our children will never get to experience the dollar menu :(
Why did you do it Elon?
bought $AMD calls yesterday cause i thought they were on discount

🤡
 OPEN THE FUCKING CASINO !
Gonna buy some TSLA calls to lose money fast. Don’t want to lose it to inflation. 😤
I don’t even wanna look at my account in 3 minutes
Awesome, 3-5 months of gains wiped in two days 😎
Imagine being a palantard 🤣
[deleted]
Bro Tesla is the scariest stock in the world
Recession cancelled
Lol where's that revenge tsla trader that sold calls for loss yesterday and switched to puts? 😂
whatever I buy, stock always go another direction 🤦‍♂️
I bought TSLA puts at open thank me for the jump
#RIP bears aka RIP my account
Shit I'm gonna get banned if TSLA doesnt hit 900 by tomorrow 🙃
We need another pandemic and period of high unemployment to fuel the next few years of growth
Pltr is the most overrated garbage out there. their stock structure is absolutely horrific for investors. Ridiculous float. Ridiculous amount of insiders that can dump on your asses. It’s going no where for years.
[deleted]
Wow RIVN is really going to have an opening proce of $175. Insane
Rivian IPO is gonna be Coinbase IPO all over again
I just want money.
Last week I thought I was the fucking man...this week I was humbled 
Fuck man
If you didn’t buy $COIN on the dip you ain’t Black
Rivn….get in loser were doin butt stuff

Boy if only I did the precise opposite of everything I’ve done this past week I’d be rich !!
Another good day fellas, buy the dip, sell the rip I’m gonna to go take a shit, I’m out.
1K —> 12K —> 3K

Is this the WSB retard way?
Rivian boutta give some validity to tsla
Rivian trade in 10 or we riot
Rivian fucking with the whole market
Yeah this weird, we were told it opens after the bell. Now nearly 3 hour later trade is still restricted. Bizarre.
Get in ford before too latw
Too late for what?
Open at $115? No thank u.
Some people are finally getting a wrinkle up there 🧠. 👍
Nice tsla rebound.  I didn’t think it would pop so fast.  Sold my puts during the drop this morning at 990
Time to buy some more for the next drill
Is ford gonna ride the wave with Rivian? How is it not traadingnyet
1:30
What are the thoughts on Rivian?
If you want to participate, buy F.
I think it will open pretty high and have a dip from the market being it’s usual self… I’ll probably buy on that dip. Hoping so at least.
But knowing me, I’ll buy high sell low ya know?
> I agree.
No products for the market, with no production, and no limit on hopes and dreams
Very cool.
It'll open looks like above $120 and pump higher, before bleeding down over the next week or two (but not nearly as low as the bears want) and then stabilize
$150 easy
Jump in or wait...I was part of the retro-fit of the Mitsubishi factory in Normal, ILL. They had trucks and vans going around the oval...wasn't some top-secret-jerk-off-fest...
The problem is most of these shit companies focus on producing goods and turning a profit instead of pumping their stock.
Need more Enron' in the market
Ford drop is fake and gay. Makes no sense. Can't be based on anything macro when GM is up 2.5% on the day. Shaking out the weak hands.
Day traders doing their daily $F trades.
>It’s amazing how $AMC and $GME charts look almost identical. Is that because the apes are right? Or just because apes are apes?

I sold my calls at the tippy top. Made 700% in the last couple weeks. Sadly I only started with $137. Thinking I should cancel my Rivian offer and buy the dip...
Please NVDA and AMD give me one chance to get out I’ll never try to day trade weeklies again fuuck
lie lie lie
Please tell me ford rebounds
I’m ruined
No your notttt head up champ
Will this be the final nail in the coffin for WISHtards?
If Ford hit 23 today, I am gonna break my NNN
Told my girlfriend the other day it was weird watching Seinfeld with no commercials whatsoever. It is literally the first time I’ve experienced it. I either always watched it live on NBC or on cable or was too cheap to get the no ads feature on Hulu.
The episodes go super quick. It’s great.
well don’t leave us hanging what did she say?
Wow you're so cool with your smoking hot girlfriend (male)
I'm actually a loser. But thank you nonetheless.
SoFi drilling pre earnings.
I'm becoming increasingly convinced the best play in today's market is to buy whatever well followed stock has earnings in 2-3 weeks and sell a couple days before.
Not a bad move
The times I did that this past month has payed off. Buy the lul and sell the hype
I'm thinking it's a sign... it's going to 30. People are selling because they know what's up *climbs back into the bushes* shhh
Imagine when space x goes public. Fuuuuuuk
SpaceX will never go public as Elon does not want to have to deal with Shareholders. The only thing related to SpaceX that will have an IPO will be Starlink.
Lost 2k on spy calls. That’s pretty neat, time to deposit more money. Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
Wait a like 2 weeks, it's going into a 4% correction. It just rode like a bull for a whole month.  If you are gonna do a call push it till atleast Jan 22
thank god the drill is back. Not even a bear/bull matter. People just became full on delusional
Twas just regularly scheduled maintenance. We apologize for any delays.
If I could go back in time I would start an EV company and IPO.  I'm good at Photoshop and can write a pretty good press release.

  
Instant billionaire.
But can you have a car towed to the top of a hill? That's how you make the real money.
>Bought 11/22c on spy at open. What a rollercoaster though i just lost a few thousand. Instead it's back to zero and profiting now. I'm go throw up. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.

Still the play
If you buy rivian at above 100 you’re retarded and deserve to lose money
Agreed.  For now.
My investing strategy is to buy the stock with the sexiest CEO. That's why I'm fully invested in AMD
Exotic taste

But well beauties r dumbo
BRK.A
RIP my F calls.
Rip my everything messed up everything
Same
gonna have to go home and explain to my dog why we’re losing the house today
There are like a billion people on the planet and I had to be born as me. Fuck.
Correction is when tesla price drops below $800
I would buy so much TSLA
SPY at 464.  We haven't been this low since ***checks chart*** last Wednesday!
>Rivian CEO: Listing Quite Emotional

Oh it's emotional, alright
Bought a bunch of calls this morning, fell back asleep expecting them to be up when I wake up. Actually down 10k.
Go back to sleep
I really like getting notified my calls are down 20% today, CONSTANTLY
Your calls are down 20%
Whole market is red and the only Puts i have are on FVRR which is up 11.74%, fucking great!
Why the fuck is everything dumping. Infuriating.
Bulls LMAOOOO
Bill what’s good with AMD bullish or bearish this week?
I’d personally wait until $130-135 to pull the trigger.
Good man buying calls for next week at $135ish
its been that way for 7 months

welcome my friend

i guess u owned boomer stocks
I bought calls
Market pulling back mid month off of all time highs following scheduled data and Fed comments. Who could have possibly predicted this totally unpredictable event?
God I feel so sorry for myself

Bahahahahahaahahahah. Imagine thinking two red days after a fucking 10 day rally straight up is the start of a bubble pop.

Bears never learn. Thanks for the cheap calls.
Butthole this morning: *


Butthole now: 🩸⭕️🩸
.005% interest rate savings account was the play today
Puts on OPEN was the play today (and probably into the future).
Down 12.5% today, LEAPS still up 152%.

Best decision was to stop gambling on 2DTE.
My leaps are down, but they are freshly bought. Took my MSFT and NVDA gains and bought SPY shares and leaps.

No more gambling on weeklies, only monthlies if I wanna gamble.
Pimp in distress, pimp in distress !!
It’s illegal to have two of these types of days in a row right?
Ya let's  call the police!
🚨🚨🚨 **RAPE POLICE** 🚨🚨🚨
im a pig and im getting slaughtered
You speak for 90% o FB the sub
Bulls have endurance to last years and bears blow their load in a day or two
it's like chess, if today is red, the next color must be green?

this is how it works right?
Yeah about that, we recently had like 7 green days in a row.
I don’t think we’ve priced in Evergrande yet. In China, property is their retirement egg even more than it is here. Most people don’t put their money in stocks as Chinese stocks are very volatile. I don’t see how this is not analogous to a 2008-2009 financial crisis. Maybe I’m just being a  🌈🐻 though and need a timeout.
The government will make sure it’s contained
china’s bullshit shouldnt affect america. is that too much to ask
How much downside do you see if we do price it in?
The Great Recession of Wednesday afternoon. Never forget.
How many of you sold your calls and bought puts at the bottom rn
Tomorrow is 11/11.
11/11 #neverforget
Everyone load up on puts!!!!
Yes sir yes sir 3 bags full
All in on puts, fuck the market
Buy the dip! Buy calls for cheap. Profit tomorrow
buy puts it's going down like a 3$ hooker
40k of wish puts riding thru close wish me luck
Show end result

Friday
Bro dont
Good luck man lol. Seems to me bad earnings are already priced in as they said this quarter would be shit last earnings call. So anything better than terrible will be a positive.
Damn, man. The market is really not bussin’ right now.
sheeesh
What do you call a psychic little person that escaped from prison ?

A small medium at large
Would you rather have your money sitting in the bank and slowly lose its value to inflation or open up a brokerage account and speed up the loss 📉
Well, when you put it like that, I guess I better buy some GME 500c that expire Friday
F back to 20 Please
Up too 20.50 plz
Bought 30 22.50 12/3 calls that lost 60% of value within an hour of me buying them haha. Bad day to buy “the dip”
-29% yesterday. -19% today. I don’t like this game anymore.
Did you read the instructions well before playing?
Tomororw -9%. You’re getting better
Reversal is coming. Just gotta stay solvent long enough
TSLA gotz bullzballz
Yeah, I'm just gonna go ahead and say it:

&#x200B;

Most consumers did not get a 6% pay raise this year.
Amazon warehouse workers got like a 20%+ pay raise this year since they need slave workers
Slavery = 20% raise. Hmmm
20% more of a crap wage is still crap for work so stressful you pee in bottles to save time
Idk I think a ton of people job hopped and got a much bigger pay raise this year as a result. I did it and most colleagues I know did it as well. My pay increased by 20% this year
hey hey hey, that sound like communism to me ...

to reach that 6% bench mark you need to start an onlyfans and sell feet pics, or sell pics of boot straps
20% + double bonuses at my work.
Today:  markets nosedive on inflation data

Tomorrow:  jobless claims fall, markets rise

Friday:  markets shake off inflation concerns, close at fresh highs
Jobless claim come today because tomorrow is veteran day
Nice catch
And repeat for like two years
Shhh don’t leak the script bro
if you sell bc of inflation you’re just falling victim to it
the real ipo is the friends we made along the way 😌
To anyone out there who is depressed, and doesn’t like their job. I recommend joining the trades. The brutal hard work is like therapy, gives me a sense of purpose and accomplishment, also plumbers are only going to be making more and more money. I also recommend reading books and spending time appreciating nature. Try to stay away from the rabbit holes and absurd emptiness that is infecting current society
Don't be a meat cutter though, might as well make Big Macs nowadays
I could single handedly end this pullback by buying a Spy or Tesla put
No need friend, I have a 461 put giving her plenty of support
DO IT DO IT DO IT $DOIT
I keep thinking but nothing happens
Ayo can’t fucking sleep- tryin to quit weed. Sup degens
Smoking weed in bed also trying to go back to sleep
I passed out at 9 woke up at 2:30 and smoked so I could sleep longer, made it till 6. Sometimes you just gotta do it
Why would you do thst
Melatonin and sleep aid bro
Yea true; I never took melatonin because (of weed mostly), and that taking it regularly reduces its effects and gets you dependent on it. But good idea for these few days for sure, Ty
Same here lol

Pure encapsulation ‘best rest formula’. Shit will knock you out. Only reason I’m still awake is because I’m out
Weed is better than my hangover
I've come to enjoy the pain associated with trading. You wanna open -5% and destroy my calls and livelihood? Do it, pussy. That's the kind of thing that really gets my amygdala fired up
Same bro
I'm likely digging my own grave but you bet your ass I'm averaging down on all my calls today. Whether cardboard or escort, I can see drowning in a box in my future.
That's the fucking spirit.
Just buy them with plenty of time to expire and you'll be good no matter what happens this week
"I'm tired of waiting for the drop that will never come, I'm buying the tip!"

Cathie bought $22m worth of PLTR on the dip. Fuckin A what is going on
Cathie has bought every PLTR dip. And I swear to god she’s probably still down.
It’s 9.8% of her portfolio atm and it’s down 1% this morning. She’s down $220k so far since last night. Not like it matters to me and they fluctuate but just saying
Thought it was 36mln?
I remember buying roblox right at the ipo and then selling it once it hit 70 and feeling like a genius.
Evergrande currently has a 25% strong buy on Webull 🤡
Needs more WeBear
Cathies about to hit the woods after these losses
She'll double her OF subs fee.
I hate it when people pass me on the right side and I become their bitch
Drive faster or get in the right lane then
Looks like I’ll be drinking again this morning
My suggestion is anything 8%+ ABV, or just go full degen and drink bourbon and yell at CNBC all day.
I work graveyard so it’s sort of excusable- but yeah, it’s going to be bourbon and I’ll turn on the tv to get angry
Oh man, yeah totally acceptable if you’re working graveyard. It’s like your 5pm now lol
Bears better hope for bad CPI or this thing launches at 8:30
For a smooth brain... Please explain
We got a “beat” on macro inflation levels yesterday(although still laughingly high inflation year over year). Today is the CPI or consumer price index data release. Essentially how much end users are paying for commodities. Groceries, cars, etc

If it’s a beat, then it will likely stop the bleeding on overall markets today. 

If it’s a miss though, boy howdy, shit probably goes down.


CPI is currently one of the top economic data sets that are moving markets lately in our “inflation is too high” environment.
So what number or info are we looking for? Also thank you for that
So Glad I went 100% cash yesterday. Slept like a baby
I'm going to lose my money and get banned because of SPY. I don't care about the money but I love you guys. The worst part is I fucked up my ban bet and lost a whole 8 days.

SPY 500 by 12/23 or I'm gonna eat a whole lot of over cleaner.
At least you will be able to spend the holidays with your family.
Sorry you have to spend the holidays with your family instead of us*
No.. it's okay. Wrap it up kids.
That was a crazy bet.
When people say I’m a stay at home stoner stock gambler I just say “at least I’m the laughing stock at WSB, they like me there”
I wonder if we’re gonna set a new CPI record today or if theY fudge the numbers to keep it at 5.4% again. EVERYTHING HAS GONE UP IN PRICE
They've fudged CPI numbers fofor 40 years. It aint gonna stop now just because it's autumn
My local glory hole is still $5
Not your calls today
I don’t know why Everytime I get euphoric about the market and think “holy shit this is easy money” I don’t just sell that instinct.
Legit averaged down on nvda and Amd yesterday thinking that exact shit. Markets on fire they’ll moon. Now, I’m shambles
everybody experiences the same. it's human nature. but you need to have an experience where you took profit and then that ended up being the right call. reflect really hard on that specific experience with all the feelings that come with it and recall it everytime in the future. I know it sounds weird but it'll pay huge dividend. absolutely necessary step in becoming a profitable consistent trader
On calls or shares?
You probably just learned your next trading skill.  The moment you think it's easy, sell everything
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
This sub in a nutshell. You guys never learn.
Got a 23 dollar margin call. Oops

OK StayAtHomeAstronaut
kind of bullshit that you need a Costco card to buy food now
I think that's fair

5 Minutes to determine whether or not Calls turn into Puts or Puts turn into Calls. lol
schrodinger options
cpi was decent still a bloodbath market tho
Decent lmao
Decent? You’re fucking nuts if you think +.9% is decent.
Can I get a link please

Never mind I saw it. Wtf I though it be around 5.8-6.0% top
Bloodbath? Its just a bit red
i have tesla puts so im just being bias
Everyone in shock about CPI and inflation numbers everytime is delusional living with their moms .
It’s not leveling out anytime soon and you would know that living in the real world
Imagine not spending 10 dollars per grocery run on non-perishable food items for the last few months
how is JPow going to spin this as transitory  😒
6% inflation yeeeee. 

Only 3x the target of powell
TrAnSiToRY
Never thought Id be an NVDA bag holder but here I am.
Someone tell jpow to say something before open so I don’t get absolutely railed

TSLA holders rn: 👁👄👁
Well I think I've lost a lot of money today.

We'll see when my options prices update.
Literally pointed out how the CPI has been wildin for months now and no one cares. Idk, prob still won't affect prices.
Hurry up and overreact to inflation data just to brush it off by tomorrow.
I love how the days I get the most sleep, the more tired I feel
Just went to the doctor for this, have narcolepsy and sleep apnea
my parents have sleep apnea and I was a chronic snorer most of my life so I wouldn't be surprised if I have it although I don't think I snore much anymore ever since I switched to a healthier diet. You can add that to the list of existing medical issues I have lol
how many times have we heard this inflation crap..... buy the dip and make money... no weeklies but monthlies...
So i gues my 470s are worthless
Just wait until Warren Buffett actually starts spending his giant dragon-sized cash hoard.
He didn’t buy anything last year at the pandemic low because it wasn’t low enough for him

Obviously the gay bears will hype up how the super duper crash must be coming soon. But to anyone sane, it’s clear he’s never gonna spend it
I don't even want to be around anymore
It gets better.  I used to regret the big losses but I learned from them.
Don't say that, buddy. Life is worth living, no matter what :)
Same
Hurry up man, open the fucking casino!
[deleted]
I'll do it for five. 

Gives you five more to give to Wallstreet market makers.
My fee is $11,000. Sorry.
I like how they measure inflation against what prices were during the pandemic lol. Oil was like free back then.
Futes went negative for a hot minute or three
So much FUD. I know there is a buying opportunity somewhere in here.
Big and the number 5
Oh good, PLTR is setting up for another shit day.
I never hear anything good about this stock. That's a sign right there.
I'm so sick of it
As is tradition.
Mushrooms just kicked in.
had a great time yesterday, gl
This may be more a DMT kind of day
69 straight green days and you guys are obliterated on the first meaningless pullback.
Great gambling opportunity!
When you're trading OTM with 2DTE and 99% of your portfolio, that would definitely be a thing...
LOL, TSLA.  I was fixing to cash in my 11/12 1015 put when it dipped in the 900's, turn around and it's rocketing up, WTF
TSLA torturing shorts
Burry doesn't know what hit him
PLTR doesn’t hurt me the most everyday.  But it hurts me every day.
Death by thousand cuts
Never doubt Tesla you sons of bitches
Can't keep this market down, apparently
Just wait
Holy shit. 6.2% cpi, and 8.6% ppi. Thanks jpow
I have 0 TSLA but I need it to carry the spy to new heights

LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Whatever makes spy go up I support.
Im like a bull and all but imo bull trap rn
Every time it’s gone down in the last year it hasn’t been a bull trap to buy, but sure
I mean I’m just talking short term
Truee. Gotcha bud. Prolly right. We are getting some pretty bad economic data today
Tesla with the craziest reversal I've ever seen,  so happy I bought 100k worth more shares on a discount yesterday. I love you all
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
40 minutes of all green candles lmao.
Make it the rest of week please
My SPY 469 3dte are saved???
TSLA puts buyers are getting a closed-casket funeral.
Extremely cool to see my TSLA stop loss trigger pre-market and then have it rip as soon as the market opens.
You do know that you can see stop losses and market makers can purposely trigger them to take ur shares before skyrocket
Welp. Guess I'll wait for this house of cards to collapse and hop back on.
Yea those MM really care about his 5 shares
Stop losses are the devil
CNBC: Record inflation!

Markets: Oh shit sorry didn't mean to be red
forever buying SPY calls until Interest Rates are increased
*Flawless victory*
Entered NVDA calls. Pray for me.
Last two days of PLTR make absolutely no sense. Just going to nut up and keep buying this mf dip
Dude, I just can’t win with those fuckers. Sold it all off right before earnings to reset my baseline and try and win back my losses. Bought back in yesterday when I thought it stabilized, only to have it dip more today. Seriously, fuck me.
I nibbled yesterday on another September 2022 $13c leap. Today I went in hard at $22.80  
You played it smart. I sold the wave on PLTR back in september for a nice profit and re-bought at $23. I should have sold before earnings...  


Oh well. I think in the next few weeks we'll see a return to $26+ easy.
Are you a new palantard?
I'm not new at all. Been swing trading PLTR for a year now.   


I just think this -9% tuesday and -5% today make absolutely no sense. Their ER was great. Sure a -5% profit taking makes sense but this is especially egregious. My convictions are strong I'm buying the dip.
I agree, evidenced by the shares and calls I bought yesterday 🤮
Ford gonna hit 21!
I've made several bets this morning... all of them wrong.
Tried to buy COIN calls at open, found out Fidelity has restricted my account for losing too much in September...    

I guess its true poverty charges interest
michael burry seems like the kind of guy who probably ate bugs for attention in high school
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

What time Rivian ipo?
1:30ish
SPY closes at record high Friday
NVDA don't be a cuck and go back to 320
Needs to go to 350
The real future of electric vehicles are as a proxy for actual housing. People's trucks are going to have to become their apartments when they can't afford anything else.
As soon as I sold my SPY at a loss it bounce back.
Sell more I need it to go higher
September my account was $30k. October it was 20k. Now it’s November and it’s $1k. Time to just hang
At least it’s almost thanksgiving
I’m just going to shoot up some heroin and wait till this year is over with
.........yourself. Your sentence got cut off.
Blew up my account again… how many times until I learn… fuck I’m retarded lmao
Yeah it might be time for me to just take everything out and close my account, I haven't actually won a single trade
I don’t even know anymore lol
Post-account depression hits hard asf
It’s an epiphany of retardation
You wouldn't be here if you weren't.
Some people here just want to fit in…
Others are bots…
I love how many people in this thread are chanting for their ticker like a Vegas Craps table.
Tesla put prices are insane. $5k for 1 contract?
That’s what they called implied volatility my dude
$COST chicken Alfredo has me on the shitter all morning. Puts on my toilet

Selling CC's to GME tards has been the most lucrative endeavor of my life
I don't know why they don't do the same?  The ones that hold over 100 shares.  Unless they are lying about how many shares they own.
It's bafflingly easy to do so I don't know why either unless they're majority fractional shares and guys holding 5 shares like that's gonna do anything
Why the hell IPOs take so long to open? Asking for a friend.
each share is individually handmade
To wear you down and make you pay more than you previously had planned.
AMD always performing worse than NVDA no matter what
Ford about to pop.
When people were making bank on GME and AMC, "we need to protect investors," said CNBC.

When people back to getting rekt, crickets.
We aren't the investors they wanted to protect.
Rivian is gonna open at $120bn or something like that...
If it ever opens.
Gonna be a lot of retail bagholders
Why is the volume on SPY so low? What the hell is the market waiting for today
videogamedunkey's next upload, obviously
You a 👑. Forgot about that guy. Gonna watch him instead of working.
Thanks my nicca
🙏🤙

He will decide the fate of the market for November end of month
Love that dudes reviews.
Buy calls or puts on SPY depending on whether the next one is positive or negative
F baby what is you doing?
Day traders selling off and buying back.
Ford, you're killing my fds... Can you not??
If yall are depressed about the Ford dip use one of their cars in Forza 5. This shit the future 🚀
Why would anyone hold plantair, you’d have to be retarded.
Generational wealth.
1. You're saving money for a house

2. Now you would have had enough money to buy a house but the price doubled.

3. Wait for interest rates to raise and crash the market.

4. Now you can't afford a mortgage because of the high interest rates and everything is more expensive because of inflation.
And then refinance when rates drop
I doubt I should continue to trade . Fukin shit. Fuk
Today sucks ass
holy fuck US 10 Year
Release the rivian and decimate this market. Hurry up, just do it. Pull the trigger coward. Ruin me
My gf won't sign up up for webull so I can get 6 free stocks. Fffuuuuuu
dump that bitch
Cmon rivian,  you can't pull the rug if you don't lay it down first
Imagine going cash gang because you are worried about inflation devaluing the US dollar
I have a friend who did this in April 2020…he still believes we’re going to have a big crash any day now. Some people are just born 🌈🐻
They would have been nice on Monday.
Lol
literally just buying one share of rivian to feel something.
We’ll looks like I’m Bagholding ford calls 20C
Same, personally I'm just happy I can feel the pain I used to..
You guys so busy watching Rivian , bonds are literally falling off the cliff , Burry is printing because of this
Stock market man not faking bonds
TLT lost 2%, it's already taking some back
Rivian pump. I'm waiting for the sweet sweet tank job.
Rivian already up 8% in 5 minutes lol
Just jumped into Rivian. Someone had to put a stop to this
lmfao, you actually did it
Lmaooooo literally crashed right after
straight up not having a good time bro
Prices for everything are rising due to inflation except for my stocks which keep going lower every day
bought 2 shares of Rivian at $112.80  ;)   already down $2.75
I got 3 @ 112.22.  our loss porn is gonna be soooo vanilla.
Another bag created
Everyone having a good time?

market down half a percent

zoomers: GREAT DEPRESSION IS HERE TIME TO JUMP OUT THE WINDOW
Monday was a lot more fun than today
Just threw all my liquidity at spy calls. Time to tighten my chinstrap ⛑
♿
IF TSLA is worth 1 trillion, Ford is worth at least 4x it's current.
TSM has has cash equal to its market cap and still doesn’t go up, logic means nothing.
I'm hoping TSM goes up. Bought an ATM April call
Or it could be that $F is more realistically valued...
Some days I lose money, some days I lose more money, but what's important is having fun, which I am also not doing
LOL
SPY raping me

NVDIA raping me

Whoever bought a $400 GME CC from me this morning, you're not very good at this and should probably stop
@ me next time 😤😤
GUH
surely the algorithm you sold to will be very mad with you
It's okay I'm an algorithm too
What exp?
The day is still young
Down 7k today. Shit day right here
8.5k here so far . I’m holding, the world is not ending
11K and yes the world is not ending..
STOP THE DUMP
No
Power hour needs to hurry up and get its ugly ass over here
It’s gonna sour hour bulls not gonna be happy.
Lord and savior JPOW will save us from our sins
Lol have you been here the past couple days? Drill team 6 hour
who is margin and why is she calling me on my robinhood?
TSLA gonna drop and take SPY even further down.
Please, let it be true 🥺
Tesla touched 3 digits today.

It is gonna go back there soon. Probably tomorror or friday.
Oh no, we haven’t seen SPY at this level since *checks chart* last Wednesday
Well there go my gains the last couple of weeks... fuck.
And my account just went green on Thursday thanks to NVDA... fuck
oh no! my portfolio! it’s broken!
Hi. I was kicked out from r/stocks for being too dramatic and said i should join this sub

Can’t believe I got dragged back into SPY weekly calls just in time for a blood bath. SMH, I never learn
I’m about to message TD support and ask for a refund
Oh, ok. 

Rivian has priced in at $100/share with a 100B market cap?

Normal, healthy market conditions. Makes perfect sense.
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/AlmightySnoo (6/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1300.0 when it was 1201.3601 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
RIP
Pltr has support around ~$0.00
With inflation this high it should be propping the market up - where else are you gonna put your money in times like these
Your mattress?
Boiled demin
So the market decided that inflation, which didn't matter since May, suddenly matters now? 

Ok.
Fuck it, all in crypto. Can’t get worse….rite?

Spy just trolling us now.
Woooooot fuck this market
Finna hold my calls till they’re fucked in December fuck you fuck the market
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)
Why? Sell and roll down and out. Don't be stupid
My day to day trades are literally preventing me from becoming wealthy at a young age. I should just put it all into SPY and quit at this point.
Not a bad strategy
Open up daily chart, add RSI to it. Every time RSI dips below 20 on 4hr or Daily chart on SPY buy 2 month out calls. Ez pz límon squeezy
Welp I’m completely unhinged at the moment
Who else thinking ford reaches back to 20 tomorrow
I need that to be the case
God my 11/12 20c sure hope so
Tripled down on spy today. All in on 12/10 470 monthlys and 500 EOY.

My TSLA put only cost me $100 but it has completely paid for itself in entertainment value alone
Fuck it spy calls i like being the outlier
Outlier? Lol isn't it a no brainer?
Spy only go up ⬆️ FEC more like Feel deez nuts ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
For real that’s almost everyone. Or everyone who likes money
I bought a tiny position of 470 just now.  Hope for gap up and sell tomorrow
TSLA put holders big mad
Real ones didn't sell today 👌🏼
Well, there are reports that Evergrande has just defaulted. Fucking finally.

Hope so. Fuck ‘em
Pour one out for NVDA
I’m excited to average down these $600c 1/2e
I feel for anyone that wasnt able to get out of nvidia calls yesterday.  After september fucked me I was lucky enough to get out yesterday.  Saw the writing on the wall.
I bought puts just for the simple fact Elon said what he said. Anticipated a pullback on any tech that had a similar run
Yup. I got out with $20k in gains within seconds of market open. Loading up again today sub $300
Same. This market is like musical chairs. You can make good money, but have to know when to stop. And a huge dip would be nice too, it means there's another face ripping rally after. Perfect conditions for traders
buying more today when it goes below 300
Well my friend, it’s time to buy. Sitting at 294
execution went thru at 298 - only 30 shares, but brings me up to 50 total - in 5 years I should be even..
I’m too nervous to do anything. I have literal wet, wavy, paper ass hands susceptible to folding on a slight breeze.

Lmao SPY dip being bought just in case numbers are fine and we rip, people don't wanna miss out.  

This market is truly hilarious.
It’s a joke at this point
I miss yesterday morning when NVDA was 325 and AMD 155
It was during pm yesterday that I saw NVDA above 320 and thought, yeah, 380c are *definitely* the play. What can go wrong??
Yeah cause you bought calls like me. Damn
I actually sold 155 calls against my shares but damn still stings
Bought puts on both.  Let’s go!
Rip
Is this the dip we’ve Been waiting for 🤤
Big oof on COIN. Fell bad for anyone who went in on calls
Yea, I was up 50% thinking I had a 10 bagger.... sucks.
Interested in 100 shares of Rivian at $62 via SOFI trading app.

Deposited $6200 as instructed Monday, only got $5000 instant to use since it would take 3 business to clear.

Got notification last night at 11ish, and I had to confirm my order before 11:59 p.m.. Confirmed last night for $78 for the total of 64 shares.

Just got confirmation this morning, only be able to get 30 shares.

What a roller coaster.
shits gonna be like $100+ by the time we can buy it
Damn you’re gonna be happy you didn’t get the 100 when rivian drops below 30$. Happens everytime with new IPO’s.
Shits gonna run today
Lol INFLATION IS TRANSITORY PUMP IT IM A RETARD!
Look out below
Lmfao all I had to do was hold my puts yesterday wow
That shit just dropped a dollar instantly I've never fucking seen that
I remember *my* first day in the market.
Time to buy the p word
BANNED
Pussy?

Should I sell my 470c…
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
It all depends on expiration, if it's in December, you're fine, maybe even end of Nov.
It’s fucking Friday🤧🤧
I think it'll pop up a little after the open.  I don't think it's a bad as it looks right now.  Retail wants to buy sooo badly.  GL bruh.
Thank bro
You know youve made a solid investment when it loses 15% of its value on a single tweet of a potential insider sale
So wouldn’t inflation be good for stonks? Like where else will rich folk put their money to beat inflation
> I'm not rich. I make $200,000 a year
Not today vis mod, not today
It's not what you make, it's what you've got left over.
High out of the norm inflation creates uncertainty. Thus people pull out. Also name me one country that ran through stagflation and it turned out good
Other countries’ markets or currencies.

Ok so you smooth brains explain this to me. If inflation is so bad and there’s no money to be made in bonds wouldn’t u want to buy stocks to hedge your dollar? I know high growth tech will take a hit but value stocks might be the call?
Yes but Wednesday is opposite day
Ok so why is my portfolio red then, twat
Cyclicals, metals, energy. Tech is going to take it in the ass today.

Like people's paychecks
I had 2 $900 Tesla puts bought at open Monday. Lost 64%. If only I had held through the storm…..
I day traded 9x 1170P weeklies Monday for a small gain. Woulda been worth my house yesterday morning if I held.
Damn that sucks
Down $16k yesterday. Already down $2k today.

Might I recommend puts?
yikes. only time I've been there is at an actual casino .  Hope you can afford it.

It'll be fun watching my portfolio be literally cut in half when the market opens
Why blud
Probs because homie is 100% in options
6.2%...geez Jerome's arm must be tired.  Cranking overtime.
Who buys $RIVN in this CNBC hype is a true retard.
Coincidently a song called "The Rope" started playing on youtube music. It can't be a good sign.
I’m not even looking at my brokerage today. I’m a ride or die so it doesn’t even matter there’s gonna be a couple days of blood red
Hey dad r/bogleheads is that way.
LEAP calls actually
The RIVN bid/ask spread is ridonculous. I don't think my limit order is going to hit, and that's probably ok.

Or it'll hit during a flash crash. That probably wouldn't be ok.
Where are you seeing the bids? I’m in at IPO price but I can’t see anything other than that
Level 2 data
You should be thankful
I need F to announce that they will be releasing a vehicle powered with the tears of children by Friday. Is that too much to ask?

I am feeling like SPY gonna recover right after it opens so I might just paper-hand my puts
Nah we going down
If you have puts they're probably up over 100%
Good day to buy. Market open holidays are usually mad green.
Tesla retards!!!!!


Start your buttholes!!!!!

🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁
Fuck, technically got a pay cut because of high inflation and now all my calls are dumping. Guess I’ll keep being poor for a bit.
So who's the guy that bought tsla at 1230 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
How the fuck DID TESLA go green
CPI highest it has been since December 1990?? Bullish
Not gonna lie, think TSLA gonna hit ATH again today
Don’t worry guys, I just bought more puts - That should fix this.
Thank you for your sacrifice
Thank you for your sacrifice. Your tendies will be used to feed young bulls.
Is every single costco in the states packed all day every day too? Here in Canada it is for sure
Yes. Parking is the worst.
Cant help but realize they must be absolutely printing money. Packed with consumers every day, their product goes up with inflation. How harmful could it be to their business?
Well with high inflation people will shop there even more to avoid higher coast of a regular store
Face ripping rally on the way

Moooooooooom! Tesla is doing the thing again.
Yah I mean is this TSLA move just dead cat bounce/FOMO? I can't see high inflation being good for TSLA. Their books are kinda wack.

You're over paying
Rivian gonna open over $120 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
> I'm not sure what you mean by that?
He means it's gonna open over $120 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
What’s it gonna open at?
Helping lucid. Nice
RIVN debuting in 60 seconds. Get your front row seats to the craziest FOMO seen in a while
RIVN 200 EOD
Shit will be 400 by End of Week. 

This shits not even a company at this point its just a propped up TSLA villain
That would be crazy.  I got 5 shares in the IPO even though I asked for more.
When I grow up I want to be just like VisualMod
RIVN hitting $500 by close
I’m long pltr and I love watching it burn, peice of shit
That's....man, you've got some issues to work through, huh?
I mean maybe, nothing extremely alarming imo. Dont we all have things we need to work on?
True enough. I prefer to encourage my longs while shitting on my shorts, though.
Lol, fair enough, after so much cheering and heart break, I’ve sort of turned sour, no I enjoy watching it burn although in return it burns my money.
Is ford gonna blow up still??
I mean Rivian is set to open at $120 and they have a billion dollars in shares
> The company is valued at $1.7 billion, which means it has to sell for more than that in order for the stock price to go up.
Lol. Ford has climbed 200% in the last 5 months. It's had one day of pullback. Chill
Put in a buy order for 100 RIVN at 78. 100% chance it doesn’t get filled
Anyone else account down 30% in the last month or just me?
Down 70% in 3 days
Literally markets been hitting all time highs all last month

You should just buy spy and call it a day.
Every time I have played SPY calls or puts I’ve lost money.  EVERY time
Longer dates or do shares,  need time for things to print. 

You don't cook your tendies for 30 seconds, you bake them bitches for 20 minutes
Wisdom. Some bundle of sticks said something about "It's not timing the market, it's time in the market". I mean he was just some nerd but I don't know it kinda makes sense.
Up 300%
Is RIVN gonna moon when it opens?
RIvian opening at $120+ …. Geez
buy PLTR at $23, sell PLTR at $27

rinse and repeat
Calendar spreads are super profitable. Buy a bunch of long dated calls and sell OTM weeklies to retards.

Bro the market should be pumping on inflation news. How else we going to combat this inflation
Rivian gonna be 200 EOD
Went all in amd lol
Bought a 1/19/2024 200c can't go tits up.
Me be will be devouting weekly income into this
What's your timeline? Calls? Bold move after its recent run but I can see why it's justified
Quantum computing stonks are trying to breakout from the cave. This will be benefit in the longer run. Intel bulish from now until april acording to long trend stock pattern.
Damn, you bullish as fuck saying Intel will move. AMD got a chip deal with Amazon I think. Good luck i wish you well on that AMD scoop for sure
To be honest i do not own any intel stonk but every time I see a core 7 intel computer Ill buy that one and don’t even bother what amd core the other has inside
Stay there

Man even with fake manipulated data and owner equivalent rent bullshit were still seeing inflation over 6%, and the market doesn't care.   

This won't end well.
>owner equivalent rent bullshit 

What?
Housing costs in CPI don't scale with the price of homes. They scale with the last sale price basically for home owners. So house prices can increase 10% in a year but housing costs in the CPI may only increase 3-4%
Imma name my first born Rivian
Sounds like he overrated. Still got the IPO
I’m going to adopt and change the kids name; first name *Margin*, second name *Call*.
Whoever solid me 320 coin call at 6 dollar per share 🤡
I honestly don't know how I managed to hang on through that excruciating two day recession. 

Glad it's over.
RIVN at 120 (or 78 for that matter) is outside my personal risk tolerance but I did add more shares of F as a proxy bet.

I think F ends up selling far more electric trucks than RIVN too.  Brand matters a lot in trucks.
Ford has way better performance as a business and same valuation as RIVN if anything has room to skyrocket it's Ford
RIVN at 125 and JPow still thinks the market needs to be propped up.
Ford really clinging on to that boomerism
What else do they have?
a best selling electric vehicle?
The chip stocks like NVDA and AMD do this little cute game where they pretend they might stay low and then, the second you glance away from them, boom. They shoot up.

Am I doing it right ?
I mean 900 to 6000 is good
Yeah I know but the fact I could’ve been at 14k or even 10k really hurts, I’m not trading rest of the week I’m an idiot
I hope u learn from ur mistakes, retard
I think after taking two big losses I have, I just need to stop trading for the day when I make big loss bc I’m emotional and just lose more like the retard I am 
I’ll figure it out one day
can you motherfuckers get off your phone when you drive?
Watch the rivian IPO be the peak of the 12 year bull run
yes, theyve delivered 42 cars
Why do I always catch the recessions :(
I said it once and I will say it again the turnip market in animal crossing is much more enjoyable than this shit
Rivian gonna open at an insane number.  Way better to just play Ford.
I dont get the $F price action today, looks like capping below 20 for friday options

Amd always recovers
Blew up 20k down to my last 200 figured might as well waste it on Affirm puts betting it'll drop 30% basically already kissed my whole portfolio goodbye Lol
Down 11k not sure if I should cut loses or ride calls into 0
TSla gOinG REd
OK, so SQ and PYPL dumped after earnings. Dont give a fuck about SQ, sad about PYPL. Anyway,  so 'they' think that we think SOFI will also dump, so we go short, buy puts, get wrecked etc.... So I'm going with a reverse psychology play and going to double down on my SOFI calls (dont worry, they're Feb and ITM, so it probably cant go too horribly). Wish me luck.
Only made $66 today 😕
Thats 2x more than losing $66.
Just fucking kill me. I can’t believe I didn’t get out when I had the chance
Next time you get the chance to get out, you won’t.

Who bought Rivian at the top? Show yourselves
107 but hoping it gets cut in half so I can double down
You are doing great, love the energy!
I like it as a ten year play
...... i will never apologize
Time to commit sudoku. F taking my butt cherry
I’m down 8k so far. Good thing my calls don’t expire until Friday

You definitely should’ve just cut your losses and bought poots.
Probably but I’m dumb
How is it still drilling
Drill Team Six called in Team Seven and Eight.
all in on F, PLUG and PFE
Puts on my retirement.
SPY puts feels like the move so I should buy calls
Why the fuck is F going down
Mood
Probably investors taking profits since it's up 30% in the last 2 weeks and is at 20 year highs
Because everyone assumed rivian would pump it so obviously it didn't
Make it stop  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

\*raises crayon\*
🤘
I need to stop buying but I'm to retarded
down 20% today and I'm just vibin
11% here
Lmao SPY goes up 17 of the last 19 sessions yet everyone’s shocked that we are pulling back
if you are all in calls, you need to learn to hedge. like even portioning a quarter or even sometimes like 10% during high volatility, you can literally mitigate all your risks from your calls getting fucked. it's how you stay in the game. don't be a retard
exactly, or just buy 2% OTM spread on indices, easy
How do you hedge calls?
if you're actually being serious, you hedge by buying puts usually a shorter dated one but it really depends on your dte and strategy. For example, you have tsla 1150c 12/03 but if there's a deep pullback and you think it's going to go lower, you buy 11/19 1000p and take profit near the bottom. you at least recoup good amount of your initial principle on your calls
Sell some or buy puts
Anyone else buy calls during a downtrend thing sits the bottom, and doesn’t buy calls during an uptrend because you think it’s top?
Guys I’m starting to think my 470c for Friday won’t print…
🎶Do you BeLiEve in life after Guh🎶

Someone dear god, anyone please please close the casino.  I have about an ounce of blood left.
Zoomed out and I’m still up $400 for the week. Time to buy more calls.
old man Buffett is right. Be greedy when others are fearful, gamble on some calls bitches
Set the chart to 1M out and tell me you wanna buy calls after a 1% dip.
are we talking short, mid, long? With monthly being the unit of measurement
For those of you who are new here... this is when you buy calls
im afraid not. Everyone did that all day. We'll move to a lower low and then work our way back to here slowly most likely

&#x200B;

edit: I say this holding bags of calls bought recently
I probably would have been more patient and waited til now. I think we bounce back. How many times have we sold off cuz of "inflation" just to bounce back the next day? I could see spy recovering into close
> I know you are very impatient. I can tell by your question that it is hard for you to wait until the next day when spy will bounce back again because of inflation.
No. It's not.
Pltr -17% in 2 days on positive earnings, what a great day to lose money

/u/ravensgators (0/3) made a bet that TSLA would go to 950.0 when it was 1045.281 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Thanks for playing retard
As someone who will probably also be 0/3 tomorrow: we’ll get them next time

🥱 just woke up from a long nap. How green are we today?

Not bad now, SPY rippin
What exactly is the point of pumping TSLA? So that Elon can sell higher and rack up more billions?
Theyre leading the EV revolution and have the safest nicest EVs
Should I set my stop losses at -80%? I missed all the other percents
what is a stop loss
How stop
\-100% is the best stop loss target
Elon could shit in a bucket and get a million bids on it at auction.
Anyone still l holdingford calls
Unfortunately yes
Yeah... Till 0
Sold my spy puts for nice profits. Idk if I’m feeling trying my luck again
Calls for infra week
Tesla just blew my account up. Puts at the bottom of that were not a good idea
TSLA makes no sense. Once you understand that, trading it becomes possible.
I could've told you when to buy puts, then it would've taken you a tad longer to blow your account.
Watched my account wing $8k and I can’t feel anything. Did i evolve to next level autist?
I’m 0-2 on tsla puts. Will I ever learn? No, cause I’m a penis head.
this is why I never fucking get involved with TSLA options

Who panic sold then it rocketed right back up??

Yes lol

Go home $TSLA, you’re drunk

Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are greedy, save a bunch of money on your car insurance by switching to Geico.
JUST OPEN THE FUKING CASINO AND LETS GET THIS SHIT OVER WITH!!!!!!
100% balls today. Massive bull balls.
Rivian revealed in its prospectus that it expects to lose $1.28 Billion in the third quarter with revenue ranging from $0 - $1 Million. The company will IPO at an implied valuation of $106.6 Billion ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
sounds like it’ll moon. i’ll be watching from the sidelines.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
When do you get tired of making sense
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Window lickers unite.  I’m in
it's coming in on time with the EV upswing, shit will be at 10 dollars by Monday
Sucker bet of the Year!
Stories like this make me think a major crash is coming in the next year or two
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
My pronouns are now oh/no
Yesterday was the dip, you fucking retards.  Today we open low and close high.
Ford market cap - 77 billion

Rivian market cap - 97 billion

LMAO at this market
9billion of that rivian is Fords position. 

That means Fords position is about 1/8th their market cap lol.

Ford should dump it and announce a new factory for EVs and a stock buyback.
As a teenager I was attracted to any girl that could get on top of me without crushing me, now I see a 10/10 and couldn't care less. My testosterone has run dry boys, pour one out for me.
your body is telling you that you need to try men
That's what a porn addiction does
What about when you look at men? Bet that does it for you
exercise more.
What about when you see women who'd crush you now?
If you love TSLA at 1,200 I guarantee you'll love it at 900
True
Shit why buy it at $900 after the 4:1 split
> It's not about the price, it's about what you do with your money
Let’s start this thread off with a positive vibe so that all the people waking up will think this is a dip buying opportunity.
SOME of the stock that tanked yesterday are having SLIGHT second thought!
Good thing I didn't go all in on yesterday's *dip*. Maybe today though.
i was thinking the same thing.  hesitated on buying so many "bottoms" but it just felt like there'd be 1-2 more days of cool off after this insane run
True. If you look at the yearly RSI on SPY it was overbought. Def expecting more pullback. I opened Jan 335 call debit spreads on FB. If there is more pullback I might just close the short legs of those and let it run. Opened MSFT 330 put credit spreads too. Hoping those hold up
I was burned before by buying the first red day. Then the first green day following a streak of red. I might try the second green day next time.
This Rivian IPO reminds me of my friend selling his house two weeks ago.  Good timing before things go south.
My company lost several projects recently due to inflation - food producers are reluctant to invest in new production machinery cause they get crushed from raw material, energy and packaging prices.

Absolutely bullish.

Normally we are not affected by any recessions, but inflations hasn’t been a factor in the last decades.
My company cannot supply the demand.  Most issues caused by relentless "cost saving" measures which made mfg lines obsolete. Now we can't invest on upgrades or repairs because of high cost and unavailability.
I work for a mfg of goods for powersports, Ag and automotive.

We are passing 18-24% prices increases and the major OEM’s aren’t even blinking.  More of a « how can I get my parts » mentality.

For this we are looking at Mexico.  Not for cost, for labor availability.
I can ear my company across the street, waiting to be fed. Back in 90min.
Sorry, folks. I bought SPY calls EOD yesterday, so I think this might be the start of the next Great Depression.

If we survive this, I’ll be sure to learn my lesson. How fucking dare I ever try to make money?
Nah its me. I brought spy calls for dec.31 at friday. Since then spy wont get up.
Thank you for your service!
I hate you both.
Is anybody else a little butthurt that Elon didn't ask WSB opinion before selling? Kind of like a quarterback asking random people on the street what his next play should be instead of his teammates. If we have a vote, will he buy back in?
He hasn't sold yet...
Well that's not good. Does that mean this drop is only the beginning if he does follow through?
Probably, but this decline isn't all due to his tweet.

This whole run up wasn't due to people buying shares. There's no support. This was all due to a gamma squeeze, people buying calls, which makes MM buy shares to hedge. As option interest winds down and prices go down making deltas go down, MMs will dump their shares as well because they no longer need them to hedge.
This week has been a roller coaster and it's only Wednesday
Already tired of nvda and Amd not going up
RIOT running to mid 40s before ER.

60s by end of next week.
This was my play with the profits I thought I’d make with SPY. Today’s bloodbath will have me eating noodles.
My portfolio is getting closer to being green overall and it makes me nervous
How do y’all chill yourself out from FD’s expiring super close. I find myself wanting to trade 0 days for those X baggers up or down.
Just remind yourself that it’s retarded and do it anyway, ultimately paper handing it like a bitch and losing your entire week’s worth of winnings, only for it to then launch toward your expected price and fulfilling its prophecy of being that X bagger, leaving you feeling hollow and ashamed
Generally I look for another play I believe in just as much with a longer expiry. Ask yourself if you would make that short dte trade rn if you weren't already in it.
Unless I’m seeing things, COIN had their analyst price targets raised?
V SHAPED RECOVERY
FLYING V
Looking like a good day for some bargin shopping today
The way $RIOT is dwindling around $39 after getting 20% gain in 2 days is shorts trying so hard to cover and keep it down. 
With earnings coming up, bit all time high and fellow mara ath, its going up another 30-50% in coming weeks. 
$RIOT
Damn, I thought we were getting railed here on AMD. Then I had a gander over at NVDA. 💀🤣
My babies ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)

It wasn’t a minute ago, we’re takin on water 🗿

spy500c 12/23

if this bounces im cutting it awfully fucking close with those first ones. im thinking the second ones will still be pretty safe to make some money. got in at .58 and .38
GME does not fear the dark side
Gme and loopring are jedi
Nerd
The Lord of all EVs!!! Rivian trades today!!!!!
Jesus what the fuck are you high on? If the sector is down this shit is going with it, and IPOs always dip the next day or 2.
Yes never buy on IPO wait for it to tank, and buy before the options chain kicks in ~
Last sale b4 Xmas get ur tickers now
I don’t know how I can consistently pick the wrong options day after day and just bleed money. I need to do the opposite of my gut. Like wtf
Stop trying to chase the market
Because it's too fast?
You forget theta gang too
I just realized that it's been a while since I was awoken by tin can exhaust Honda Civic. It only took the Earth 20 years to oxidize them off, too long, if you ask me.
Goodbye TSLA, at least we know you're good at downhills now.
Bottom in on AMD?
Just buy it you're guaranteed to get a stiffy within a week. It's better than Viagra.
Have some Dec 3rd $155c. Love this stock
what bottom lol. it was in the 120s just last week lmao
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Seeing a pattern here?   Stocks pushed to high valuations, some around 52W highs.  Earnings come in at or around expectations, and stock gets crushed.
Every damn time
Though once the falling knife hits something there could be some buying opportunities.
Red days cometh
stronger correlation with elon's tweets
That SOB.  If your going to sell 25BN in stock just file and start selling.  Phase it in over time so the market can absorb the shares.  Instead he broadcasts it out on Twitter and crashes the stock price.  He is so rich it's just a game.  He obviously doesn't give a dam about his shareholders.
His employees too, tsla lowball offers and the only reason people take them is because of the stock appreciation (outside the elon stans at least). The dudes a total dick
Everything is down except doordash. You can't make this shit up.
Cold, overpriced meals that are missing multiple items because the delivery guy helped himself are all the rage.
Urghh, everything is red. I’m not staying up for this shit. See you at 7am for close and a bit of crying. 🇦🇺
Sweet dreams!
Yo any Apple developers in here? Can we get a Drill emoji to be the 🚀 for bears?
Turn your phone upside down
New to the stock market and put $6k in nvidia at 306 bucks a pop. How fucked am I?!
If you’re playing FDs you’re probably fucked. If stocks, just don’t check your trading app for a few days
You bought it at the top with a straight 1 month run up. I think you’ll be holding for a while is what I think. But with that stock you should be. Only thing you messed up on is your entry point.
Not fucked at all as long as you bought shares. Hold for the long term.
You don't have to worry about buying Christmas gifts this year, if that helps
You’ll be in the red for like 2 months but if you hold long term you’ll be fine
If you bought stock you're only out the % you lost unless you hold another 6 months or so.
working from home today means making an 8 hour meat sauce and losing lots of money
Every time I post about how horrible Joe Kernen, is, he opens his mouth and somehow I manage to hate him even more.
Does he ever have an actual opinion on business matters? He seems to be just a political hack now.
Inflation = stimmy.  LFG!
🙃🤓
Data out?
8 minutes
yeah, the opposite of that really
sofi predictions?
Crush earnings but dip post market like everything else in this rigged market

Sorry.
Yesterday I bough spy puts for the first time in 6 month and it actually worked😹
that’s how they lure u back in
Yeah, I will try and not go to the dark side
I never learn. I make the same fuck up at the top of every tech run. Too many weeklies on tech as it falls
When I was a kid people would tell jokes that went over my head and I didn’t understand them for like 15 years and today feels a bit like that.
I haven't had a raise since 2019 lmao inflation absolutely wrecking me
What is this red filter on my RH? How do I make it green again?
Everyone is saying AFRM puts which means calls are the play
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
I hate how the market picks and chooses which indicators to look at. One indicator could be completely useless the next month
Highest inflation reading since the 90s is something to care about. 

The Fed is going to be forced to raise rates much sooner than everyone expected.
What you're forgetting is the Fed doesn't care about inflation and they've shown that. They'll let it run hot until unemployment is down.
You can’t look at the highest inflation reading since the 90s and not turn a bit more hawkish.

That’s all it takes. Even a slightly more hawkish fed is a signal the party is ending.
Sorry man but rates are staying put
Blood red early AM
CPI
Transitory
Every one is going bank over a red day.. typical WSB behaviour
About to lose a lot of money
Kyle was right about hoarding corn, gpus, and mountain dew
Nvda 300C 1/21 👀👀
Guess I'm going to be working a decade longer than I thought at the start of the week
"inflation is transitory" what the fuck does that even mean? I don't see candy bars selling for a nickel. I'm pretty sure I can't go get a brand new mustang for $3500 like my dad did. So what the fuck does transitory mean?
> I'm not sure.
Inflation only matters as much as you get paid.  It really doesn't change much for my day to day.

Still gotta buy shit can't change that.
it doesn’t mean we’ll hit deflation ever unless the government shits the bed. just that elevated inflation rates will come down… eventually
Means it will fix itself over time. It’s unlikely tho. Only way to curb inflation in the USA is to unfortunately raise rates with will kill Equities
Means it’s not permanent, it’s just temporary.
The WSB Economic Analysis Division is currently processing the most recent data and will report their findings by market close.
In the metaverse trading started 20 minutes ago.
This market is a literally a rotation from one inflated asset to another.  What a complete shitshow QE has made
Up or down, today’s gonna be crazier than a bag full of cats
That feeling when your username becomes a self fulfilling prophecy of what your meals will look like for the foreseeable future. 😅
Fack!!!
Which one of u fuckers bought mRNA leaps when it was almost 500
LOL MARKET DOES NOT CARE
Coin rebounding and spy not tanking enough
IBM trade at the same price it did in 1999

The stock is basically a savings account
With  5% dividend. So slightly better than savings account, but not much.
Another day of being a Palantard
Once again the issue becomes there’s too much liquidity in the system and no one wants to hold cash, it’s why it is so hard for us to crash
*puts hand on TSLA's shoulder* They expect to find one of us in the crash. You sacrifice so the economy can go on.
HUT is my green little baby today, shit feels like it's about to moon.
Team HUT 👊
I hope so. Need a win today
Thank you TDA for allowing me access to the crappiest IPOs, but not RIVN. I'm not interested in KINDERCARE LEARNING COMPANIES INC.
CEO is a former Felon. My cousin is like the #7 in the company and CEO was arrested for fraud in a previous life before launching kindercare
It seems unfair to bring up things we did in past lives.
5 minutes... places everyone!

I sure hope the loss on my account is transitory
Most horseshit iv I’ve ever seen
Account down 50% at open.
GUH
Congrats girl!
🥳
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
And the dip is over. Stonks back to the prices of a week ago, which were all time highs then.
Dude I’m convinced everyone just likes sucking Elon off
For the record, I just bought some NVDA puts, so it should turn around for everyone
PLTR: We had a great quarter!

Market: Plummets 14%

This is a no brainer, gonna massive load it up and sell covered calls on this.
Everything is red, but the one ticker you expect to be rises like phoenix from the ashes. What kind of clown market is this?
Nice my spy calls are only down 50% now.. yay
Just imagine shorting SPY based on hot CPI because you can't figure out that CPI is a lagging indicator to PPI and PPI increase was modest
PP increase is always modest around here
Don't ever doubt The Musk
“Buy when others are greedy, sell when others are fearful” is how the new bubble economy works
TSLA 💀🐈bounce
💯
Holy fuck if the pullback is done then I am fucking saved
Recession cancelled
This SPY rally is really something.
Company just sent an email with a return to office plan for the employees who were not hired as fully remote. Jokes on them, I was hired as fully remote LMAO good luck team
fuck I need a new job. we were literally back in the office 3 months after Covid started.
I quit my last job 2 months ago and I worked in a DoD closed area so I was NEVER remote..... during my interview for this new job I said being fully remote or at least hybrid based on my OWN wants(I live like 1.5hrs from this office so I could realistically go when I want or move closer) was a requirement. And they obliged, i'm never going to be forced in the office again. Go remote bro
nice, yeah thats the plan next year.
So spy 470c FDs have a chance??
Yes
Who grabbed some tsla under 1k?
My three gambles are all green, $F, $AMZN and $RIVN
$TSLA is higher.  My 50k loss from yesterday is better.  Not healed but better.
What will Rivian open at? Is anyone buying?
Im all in on F which owns 20% of rivan
Bought my first FD and let me tell you I’m never doing this again
Paper balls
You either live to profit, or watch them die worthless Friday @ 4. There is no selling at a loss you paper handed bitch.
Deal. I hate money anyways
Atta boy, take your licks ❤️❤️
SPY headed to 469 before lunch
My 468 calls hope you’re right
my 470c would like that
the biggest baddest cpi numbers and not a red candle in sight. it's almost like the market heard ahead of time from their wife's uncle's coworker at a yale alumni party what they were going to be.
Yes, CNBC. Pump Ford. Yes. YES.
Long time listener, first time caller. I feel dumb after reading all your posts, but for some reason I want to get even dumber.
Ford will hit 27 off that rivan dont paperhand
If it does my calls will print print and I’m buying you some donuts.
Recession cancelled
God bless you if you buy rivian at 120 lol
I hope someone does!

Imagine driving your metrosexual EV truck out into the woods with your family.  Enjoying the pullout camp stove and making yourself a couple eggs and some percolator coffee…. 

Then someone forgets to close the rear door all of the way and the dome light drains battery.  Three weeks later, you are finally discovered fighting your family members over the last grizzled scraps of what used to be the family dog.
Implying you could drive it further into the wilderness than you could walk before the battery was dead.
RIVN is going to be chaotic and over bought at the beginning
NVDA green ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Let’s go Lucid, let’s go! Rivian makes Lucid look like a value stock.
My leaps are bussin
"Tesla and Lucid can race even higher as no-cost capital funds grow" -Bank of America. 

EVs gonna be stronkkkkkkk
Aww yeahhh
I hope the recovery of $TSLA doesn't stop until 1150, at least
rivian opening 60% above the higher end of the IPO range, inflation spiraling out of control, and the market almost completely rebounded from a red open..all is right in the world.
Lol Tesla bears getting rekt now
PTON ads on CNBC, can they afford nationwide advertising rn?
Their sub model is strong and holding, new subs are dying so its their only option
They probably paid for those spots a month ago or more.
gosh so many bears in here. Let the bull run continue aw yeee
Got a nice 37% SPY 0DTE scalp, I'm out for today, goodluck!
Bought some F counting on bonkers rivn ipo let’s go
Diamond handing my spy puts

one does not simply buy TSLA puts
How many times must PLTR break your hearts before you finally find someone else?
I sold my shares to buy some Feb 2022 24c. Wish me luck brother
You sold something that doesn't erode in value to something that erodes in value. Congratulations

Is ford gonna bounce??
Can someone fucking buy AMD
I did☹️ I even ran to the computer with the voice for Mrs. Doubtfire exclaiming “help is on the way, dear!!”….AMD didn’t want my help it looks like
BB signs deal to Licence QNX to entire RIVN fleet!
@2/per car - thats like $2400.00CAD helping to eleviate the deals total 64million dollar loss.
(or -63,997,600CAD)

John Chen thanked shareholders for their continued patience that he believes is now paying off
>Now indicating to open at $125/share, giving Rivian a $107B market cap.

Would really like to know how the price is going up when it is still restricted to trade.
Average price people are willing to pay for shares
Bids entered in on the market for when it hits the floor
WSB should have had an emergency market discussion about Rivian
Man, I put a limit sell on some NVDA calls at the near top and they immediately dropped $100 a piece in price. Couldn’t get in front to lock in gains. Went from up 50% to down 20% because of that. So dumb
Damn
I honestly can’t tell if I’m revenge trading or not. I keep buying NVDA cause I want it to go back to where it was yesterday morning
Wtf affirm.  Just wtf are you doing you god damn nerd.
They broke my heart
$PLTR getting held down so big money could buy.
I cant resist this price. I want to go all in
They just smashed earnings, but it's interesting to see them grasping at straws to explain the price drop. 

They made more money above expectations in the private sector than they missed in government contracts, but they are trying to spin that as a negative.  That's weird, because they used to say they were too dependent on government money, and now that they are crushing it with fortune 500 customers, they don't have enough government money...

And one analyst dropped his price target 25%, down to $19 because they are "only" growing 30% next year...
It will prob hit 30 soon
So big money has been loading up for 2 years?
Company didn’t even go public until last year….
Argh
Spy flatter that my stepsisters chest rn and is fucking me over. My calls havnt recovered
COIN pays me about 1k a month for fake money that's probably why they missed earnings so bad. They should find a new business, maybe make an EV
Let's go already. Cathie has orders in place for $200.
I don't even need green, just give me some volatility christ
This flat shit is booooring
Ford come on baby my f calls need u
Did the Fed abandon their mandates? I am so confused. Why even exist if you are just a market cheerleader.
COIN gonna finish the day green
Built ford boomers
Alright spy we can go above 467.10 now
After selling my calls for profit at the opening bell it’s so hard to not try and over trade
Wish i had profit
As crap as AMZN has been, nice to see it back at $3600.
Which makes no sense. Market baking in Rivian?
Calls on Lulu these pants really are comfy as fuck
🍑
So what’s the play with ford here? We gonna moon with rivian ipo?
Praying for a $1.00 uptick, but there is only one god, and he’s heavily invested in GME.
People might have sold to buy in Rivian
RIVN....let me innnnn....LET ME INNNN
Just buy Ford. Owns 102 million shares of Rivian and Fords market cap is only 80 Billion
Ford wont be as volatile but will move similarly
Keen to hold some bags?
Institutions get data a whole minute ahead of you.

Literally see the future.
Yes but we have Walter
[deleted]
Can I get some of what you’re smoking plz
PLTR is incredible. Beats on earnings and drills for consecutive days.
Same w AMD, i think market makers all selling together so they can get good low calls then they start to pump it
Some traders shit on this company and I was joking around with one here about Cathie Woods being a masochist because she may jump back into PLTR and lo and behold, she did!  She bought back in yesterday!  Dang!
It's fine AMD, you've earned a day off
Spy 470Cs expiring Friday is the way
… the way to lose moneyz
Banbet! SPY 470 2D
Lol. Ok. I guess see ya after your ban….
Reminder: If you bought PLTR on the first trading day of the year, you would be down -2.5% right now.

#GET YOUR PUTS HERE
25 mins till ford 🚀🚀🚀
Ford for the love of god move
Engine just warming up man
Gonna buy a Rivian truck via Venmo thru PayPal off of Amazon. Sound about right.
Dude when is rivian going live this is gay
AFRM is extremely unprofitable. This really should mean the stock should drill team 6 tonight.
With my luck it will rocket for a 20% gain
For my sake I hope it does not
 Yeah I have puts for tonight. God speed comrade
Really tanking today but revenue is the big thing with this company... not profit.
All about forward guidance
So like when is rivian trading this is boring
Please tell me
You’re lying
*There never was much hope. Just a fool’s hope. Our enemy is ready. His full strength’s gathered. Not only Men but tutes as well. Legions of shorts from the south, puts from the coast. All will answer Rivian's call. This will be the end of trading as we know it. Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest. If the Amazon is taken, if the Ford or Tesla falls, the last defense of this market will be gone.*
NVDA treating me like Angela White on a blacked set
double down f 20/c??
I did.
Been riding with a 20C for March since the summer lol
I need to hire a big booty goth girl to spit on me everytime I think about pressing the buy button for FOMO
oh man I want that so bad
Haven’t seen green in a couple days. Rethinking my entire existence
Going in AMD weeklies an hour ago trying to time a rebound was the worst move ever :(
Oh fuck. Oh shit.
Protip: Never ever ever ever buy AMD weekly calls
Bagholder spotted.

Rivian now at $111, maybe
$110
Damn remember when people were trying to lick cathies toes
I really Jsut yoloed 27k into 20C ford 12/17.. lol
It’ll print…..maybe. My 21c 11/12’s are in need.
how do you have so much money for being that stupid? Not from stock market gains im assuming
I work for a living
yeah but to yolo 27k on a position that will be worth 10k in a week you must at least make 500k a year
Nah like 140k, what should I buy
stop buying calls on stocks that have gone up 50% in a month during peak hype lmao
WSB reminds me of this toy I had as a kid called a barrel of monkeys

^\*Walter ^Bloomberg ^[@DeItaone](http://twitter.com/DeItaone) ^at ^2021-11-10 ^12:44:10 ^EST-0500
COOL, WHEN?
indicated price creeping down
Honest to God true question.  Why. The fuck would PLTR go up at this point?  Didn’t hold any gain after nailing $963m contract. Beat earnings, beat projected revenue, just got upgraded by Morgan Stanley from 22 to 24… goes down. There is 0 hope based off those calculations besides hope. Hope is a terrible thing
Look at the chart. PLTR been trading sideways in a channel for a solid year.

As of today it’s breaking below that channel. No bueno.

Does this mean it’s a bad stock? No. Not at all. All these contracts you mention..that’s just long term bullish for me. It’s clear that for what PLTR does no one else is even close. They aren’t going to have competition anytime soon. Have you ever talked to someone that’s used PLTR software for work? Once an organization brings it on theres no going back.

Study any price action on a growth company like PLTR…this is super normal. When it moves to $30+ it’s going to do so in the span of a week. It would not surprise me in the slightest if PLTR goes to $50 in the next two years.
Truly that is what i keep saying. It will stay flat forever
Bruh when is rivian coming out. I’m bout to exit my ford
Ford stake is almost 8 Billion dollars of Rivian. Ford about to make some money.
If Rivian opens at $100 Ford's cost equivalent is $7. Them shares fittin to be busssin
LOAD UP FORD
Shit I might just pick up ford if rivian keeps up this stall
WTF Rivan. am feeling sleepy. when does the trading start on that shit?
WISH gonna disappoint like always?
Yes
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Nope. Going to 7
Rivian will drop more lol
Fords time to shine now
I really expected more with all the hype. Glad I didn't buy in
Day drinking? No bitch. I’m averaging down my life expectancy
Oh rivian ok  ic it now
Rivian is gonna make us all rich
If you sell puts at the top
Idiot
Shit, buy puts.

Welcome. You will fit right in
Looks like my gains were transitory too
Infaltion is 6.2%; Banks: I’ll give you 0.001% interest on savings and it is 1000% higher than national average
Well banks can't really give you 6% when they're loaning it out at 2.5%.
boomer dividend stocks
SPY 470+ by friday
Evergrande officially defaulted
AMD PLEASE STOP I HAVE A FAMILY
Back to 120-130 probably. Just like last time it had a run like this.

#IS IT STILL TRANSITIONARY
Transitory now means a slow transition to forever
dont worry guys the entire market just needs to cover their shorts on literally every single ticker, mooning any minute
Nvda and AMD weekly gambles just ruined my account. Don’t get greedy retards. Could of been green on both trades but held for the collapse
Same. Still holding lol
Sorry everyone  - I bought some way OTM December SPY calls last Friday.

My bad on the action today. My bad.
Nah, I bought some 474c Veterans Day lottos last week, this one’s on me
First SPY calls I've ever held longer than an hour. I wanted to park some money in a "safe" bet for a week lol.
F
TSLA keeping SPY from completely going off the cliff.
I warned them last time, but they did not listen. I warned them again this time, but still, they did not listen.

Gonna be a whole lotta dip buying tomorrow.. hopefully!!
Cant buy the dip when the dip liquidated everybody the last 2 days 😂.  Not me though, im ready to buy the dips
So… did anyone get Rivian for under 100 a share at 1:00 ?

Only dip to never buy is sept dip. All other dips are good to go
BUY RKLB! Successful launch will make it skyrocket on friday
I've been a RKLB holder since IPO. Launches rarely effect stock price unfortunately...
To be fair, there hasn’t been a launch post-merger, so it still remains to be seen whether it’ll move
Elon could sell 50% of his stock and people will still believe T$LA is worth its current valuation
I have read somewhere that a tesla stock should worth $3000
Yeah and 90% of reddit doesn't know what a marketcap is

What an ugly week
Best week of the year so far for me. Bears can make money in a Bull market.
I lost 50k (25%) yesterday but somehow today on a far more red day I'm only 1% down.
Lucky you. I’m down 23k today
I mean, did you lose 50k yesterday? Because if not then I'm not so lucky
True. No i was 3.5k in the green
Dude every trade I enter it immediately inverses me lmao wtf is this
If Elon is selling, I'm selling too, nobody knows where the dip is
Dead cat bounce 🌈😂 This is not the dip. This is just the beginning.

It's gonna go roadster fast

If you're told to buy it here, it's a guaranteed loss. I don't know why I keep repeating the same mistake too.
Retards is always the ones left holding the bag
You’re good if you have 11/19s :)
I bought some Nvidia and AMD for next Friday on the way down yesterday morning. Was kicking myself all day and night that I didn't wait longer. Hoping they'll pop back so I can set least break even.  Mainly worried about my spy 468 calls I bought Monday for Friday. Seemed safe when it was above 470. Sold at a decent loss yesterday for SPY c that expires today. Losing all my Tesla gains from last week

Stop shopping at Whole Foods, hippie.
Try Walmart
Just been there, Redex on discount, as usual, same price 2 years ago, cakes unchanged from 1 yr ago, juice up 15% from 3 years ago. Can hardly keep up. Still practically giving away everything else.
You can do this at Aldi for $4
Probably not gonna move the markets tho.  Everyone knows inflation is bad, unless they don't buy stuff.
lamb chops were $32/pound, from what I remember
I spent $70 on meat and veggies for a roast, milk, yogurt and bananas. I put the bags in my trunk and thought I can’t believe this is what $70 is worth now. I remember grocery shopping as a kid with my mom she’d spend $100 and we’d each have to make 3 trips carrying bags in.
Inflation priced the fuck in. Look at the 1 year chart. Buying more calls on discount
Haha hahaha
I’m not wrong
In the long run you’ll be fine just don’t buy weeklies
That’s what I am doing
how much u down by man be honest😂 those 470c are beating u😂
https://ibb.co/sKG7Dss

Buying more of these
if u get puts this week u would be closer to the audi if im honest but those calls are good picks
TSLA bros, $30 billion until it’s no longer a $1 trillion dollar company. 🥺

Jeez what a goofball
So close.
DWAC to 120 was not based on any reality.
This should be a permaban it was so delusional
I think he fat fingered that zero.
Once the orange man sucks it dry all that will be left is the zero
I bet last week on PYPL going up to 250, but VisualMod banned me saying that I bet on DWAC. Maybe same here. Our ai is broken

no way
What do we think about Sofi? Will it beat earnings?
Does it even matter? If it does it may tank. I’m not sure - they announced warrant redemption so would expect exercise and a dilution of price, but not sure that impacts them right now re: earnings.
I don’t understand. Could you explain in retard words?
Redeemable stock warrants, holders have right to exercise in exchange for shares OR if they do nothing, company buys (redeems) warrants for cash. Assuming folks want shares in the company that means more shares will flood the market by mid December and dilute price. NFA and I have no idea what to do with SoFi, no positions currently
It will beat earnings, which in today’s market means it will likely dip at least a little. Information on the status of the Bank Charter is all that really matters.
PPI  is surging globally.   Rise is fastest pace since 1990.  But bonds are completely out of sync with normal economic theory.   THOUGHTS?  I am stumped!

Dang. You're one of them cynical bots, huh? Care to elaborate?

Back in TLRY, waiting the fucking moon.
Had a feeling this week was going to be a bloodbath when Biden didn’t come out and sign the infrastructure bill immediately.  It wasn’t because he wanted a photo op, it’s because he didn’t want the market to tank when he signed it
I find it incredible how people jump through these elaborate mental hoops to come up with some specific reason stocks are dropping when we just went on an absolutely absurd rally and profit taking is beyond expected.

I‘m fucking done
Great first step. Buy more!
Soo BofA, Susquehanna, and Wedbush raised their PTs on AMD to $165-$180 and we’re just gonna dip like that 🤡
They did that because they were desperate
Easy job, just raise pt every now and then to stay ahead of a stonk climbing and if it starts a downtrend just reverse and keep the pt at the current stonk price with updates every now and then update pt to the stonk price at that time.
When buy TSLA?
Anytime?
800 or 900 is when id consider it again

The way she goes
It actually does feel better knowing i'm not losing money alone, that might be the most retarded thing about this gambling hobby

I sold mine yesterday at a loss so that probably means it will take off again. Good luck
Sold my NVDA puts yesterday and switched to RBLX 🤡
2020 : No inflation

2021 : Inflation is transitory

2022 : 💥
Transitory doesn't mean prices were going to go back down. It meant that it will slow down and %YoY will return to normal.
I kind of doubt that will happen this time.
Tales as old as time 🎶
Welp I bought PLTR calls. Seems like I'm probably fucked. I'm probably out of trading money too. 26k->88K in 10 months of trading 88K->probably less than 10K in the last 2 months of the year.
PLTR is a long ass play. Better be leaps you bought!
Nope NOV19 calls. I'm fucked. All my dough about to be gone. Me and my family about to be poor for a little while. So much time spent reading about the markets, to then loss it all within a few weeks. What a joke I am
You’ll get back up man. I’ve lost all my life savings this year and im currently broke but trying to make it back when i bought the dip for NIO when it dipped heavily. 

Maybe avoid putting your paycheck in a while to stock market? I dunno. Just don’t trade based on emotions and YOLO it. Maybe try investing in a stronger growth stocks like NVDA MSFT AAPL when those stocks dip? your choice man. Good luck!!
There is absolutely nothing else I can do so yeah. I'll probably be depressed for weeks ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
This adds up
Go fuck yourself :)
Well you might have read "options" but what it actually said was BOHICA...
Who is planning to lose some money with RIVN?. What is your exit point?
At 99% loss.
That’s what I’m talking about!!! 👍
The dip will be wild.
Your average WSB retard does no better in the market than a literal monke (🐒) would if given buy and sell buttons to mash.

calls on open?
Yellen says chill, that bitch looks like an angry birds character
Alright 55 min nap before CPI numbers. Or maybe I’ll sleep 60 mins and wake up to heaven or GUH
I think below 6% is manageable, i.e. good news. Oil will fall Jan if not Dec, everything cool after year's end...under 5.5% = big green candles everywhere..0.4 for the month I'm rockin
If I want to catch this knife. Should I go in with NVDA or SOXL?
Not NVDA. I only say that because I tried to catch the knife yesterday like 3 times.. and now I’m 99% fucked
Id wait a day or 2 on nvidia.  People who didnt sell last week are panicking now

All my calls expire 11/19 so mi good?
Same. All mine expire on the 19th or further down the road. So it’s gonna sting a little today but we shouldn’t be totally fucked. I’m gonna go to work and try not to look until the end of the day.

Lets agree that was bad tweet though. The British guy did the best
Yes and Elon paid for it.  So it regained funny status.

Damn. That would have been a play that I had a real high confidence on. Selling everything on earnings seems to be the trend going forward
Guidance lower than expected
Invreased share buyback tho. Still selling calls at market open. Hoping they will be still in money.

Inflation is transitory , the oreos that got their prices raised will not go back down after the transitory period ends.
They may lower the price but the size will shrink even more!  Then they put a nice red sticker on the package. "Look! Lower price!"

Anyone know why NVDA decided to pump yesterday’s after hours, now it’s dumping after hours?
They don’t want us to be great
Nvda and amd do microchips. If tech drops then it falls in the same basket of goods.

A little rough of a comparison but it's kind of like they are the producer of raw goods that companies need a ton of to make their products. If we get bad earnings in tech, a slow down in buying it is not good.

If tech is surging on sales, partnerships to expand - more product needed, that is good.

Tesla selling off is bad for us.
Moderna is still extremely way over valued especially now that pfe/mrk are going to release their pills.

Look at what happened to mrvi every time the pill news get released for a clue
Moved most of my weeklies into leaps yesterday I will be ok
AMD wut doing ??????
I have to take a shit but don’t want to miss action in 2 minutes

Yay higher prices!
PSA: Temporary doesn’t mean quick or painless.
Thanks Joe
He whispered that in your ear, from behind….
That big dick CPI about to assfuck many of us here today
I’m starting to be ok with this…enjoy it.
Guys just relax. We had a full week of green dildos. Now it’s time for 1-2 red days. 500 eoy 🚀
The thing about volatility is, today more 🐻 will buy puts, and this increases the fear index and sentiment.

So for the next week, even 2 we will be in chop. So EoY is looking like 480 range. We may see 460 EoW
We've gone up over 10% with barely any pull back, now is the time.
I'm so screwed.  SOFI is my only hope for today.  I wanted to do puts on AFRM, but I'm not so sure anymore.  Last nights response to earnings confused me so bad that I am convinced I know nothing.
SOFI will pay off IMO. Look and UPST and then look at SOFI. Mkt cap is off by 8B or so but UPST is trading at 10x+ higher. Monster Earnings for UPST yesterday but they still decided to short it because they know overvalued it is (even though they already got bank charter). Won’t be too much longer until SOFI gets bank charter
have some balls and go in with conviction. If you lose so be it

No no the macro economists are geniuses just trust them.  They said it'll all go away by summer of 2021.  We got time right?

6% inflation not a problem right?

Perfect day for a u shaped SPY recovery
I mean is anyone surprised by the CPI numbers lol
Still fudged. Should be higher
What should it be then ?
Certainly around 10. Food, energy, and housing is all wildly more expensive than it was last year. Crude prices were literally negative in 2020
Honestly, no, so still don't get that bull run
I have 10k in qqq fd puts. Just inverse axeman and you get lambo

Maybe HUT can save me
But I am closing my position today, not going to wait for earnings tomorrow morning.

Open again tomorrow.
I think we've all talked about inflation so much at this point that it's been desensitized into a non-issue. We've already watched the scary movie sixty times. Is the man with the hatchet actually showing up or not? We all have way to much other shit to do if he's late or stuck in traffic.

There's going to be thousands of people trying to get in on their first IPO. People that were actually able to buy are going to make killing due to these idiots filling market orders.
Lot of people like me had some cash ready this morning to load up on some stuff lol
Ah yes it felt too easy with that feeling yesterday at 12 PST... ass cheeks getting slapped here
True that it had me uneasy selling stuff the other day but stuff just ran too hot for a bit, didnt sell enough though but some
Too bad a worked shit hours for the market to notice but yeah. Nice job
went all-in to PYPL @ 204.55
ok TSLA. either go up. or go down. no sideways bullshit.
Rip my DoorDash puts
Ok so now we care about inflation?
WOOOO -80% to-75%. LETS GOOO
Tesla is the stonk. What goes down, must come up
Ford just cured COVID
There goes my TSLA FD puts
Yes spy recover please make me +5% not -5% anymore thanks
I'm not in TSLA but for the love of the rest of the market, please give us the biggest mf green candle.
markets panicking about inflation when the fed has said time and time again that their focus is on stocks, not on the economy

we even have a taper timeline now and they have been clear that there are no rate hikes before taper is completed, this is an easy BTFD day
Bear trap or bull trap 👀

Edit: take your bets folks
LMAO you can’t make this shit up

last time we went down was in good economic news for once

we always go up on bad economic news though
Where else ya gonna put your money
Dip is over time to rip
Damn TSLA, you scary 👀
If you want more reliable profits from RIVN just go all in on F
aannddd im poor
Rivian is the largest US IPO since 2014

Do they sell cars yet?
they do actually, I've seen 1 or 2 in nyc , and Amazon bought 100k vans
Niceee, I’m in nyc too. Hope I spot some
Chances spy ends the day green?
90%
0%
Damn someone’s a bear
Holy shit going green. Fucking insane
Is rivian the ticket to wealth?
SPY F and NVDA calls keeping me alive today

any price target for F?
So undervalued.. When Rivian bleeds out I think money may flow into F. I don’t know maybe 25??
u think by friday mate?
Was 22 lmao now probably 40
Many people are saying we are about to see a rally, the likes of which has not been seen before. Believe me.
Moonshot
Name names or BAN!
Absolute retardation
Well F was a good play this week. Plays for next week?
Hold F
F
I have 22 and 24c expiring Friday
Ofcourse tsla goes up the min after I cash out the last remaining portion. You're welcome world...
Can’t have 2 red days in a row
Who’s buying rivn today?
I AM LETS FUCKING GOOOO 🚀 🌙 🍆
Tank turn is pretty sweet
Maybe in a month.
If I can get in early I'll fuck with it
AMZN has been quietly sneaking up on that 3600
Just buy AMZN to get RIVN
F is the New TSLA!!
lol, sure
"I bought Ford yesterday please god help me!"
well, turns out THAT was the TSLA dip to buy
Back on track for S&P500>500$ eoy

LMAO RIVN opening at $120
Bears asking for the manager right now
Must not FOMO TESLA….
Rivn gonna open at $120 fuck that
That’s the dumbest thing I’ve read all day, I’ll pass
NVDA green baby
1500 bucks for 15 minute in Tesla 1200s. I’ll take that and a killer sale this morning
F in the chat for ppl who panic sold their TSLA/NVDA calls at open
My $3 I put in tesla is up 97%
Go and buy yourself half a Big Mac
Look like the bulls and bears is fighting for the top position in the SPY. I wonder who will win at the end of today. So interesting. 🤔
Sideways. Market manipulators will win at the end of today.
People keep saying the market makes no sense. It's just a reflection of human behavior and it actually makes perfect sense. It behaves like people behave.
Correct. Irrational and greedy
And fearful. Don't forget that
Talk to ‘em!
More inflation -> more people buying stocks
Including the companies themselves.  But more so bonds and anything that isn't risky like running a business.
Til they raise rates and errybody dies
F is going to go parabolic
Bears cum in like 3 seconds
Why the fuck didn’t I sell on Monday?!
Ready to be hurt by SOFI OPEN and AFRM later
can we just go back to nvda ripping 5% every day please

Ford owns 102 million shares of RIVN.  If it prices at $125, that's worth $12.75 billion.

Ford's current market cap is $79B.  You can decide for yourself how much of the RIVN stake is priced into that, but whatever's left over buys you a pretty good car company.
but RIVN will tank to under $100 in prob 5 mins
Still would be worth more than Ford's entire market cap around $90
it will keep tanking
Its a huge windfall for F regardless.
Is today a buy the spy dip kinda day?
Yes
Chamath Palittlepptiya
F leaps now.
I think RIVN will crash as soon as the first buyers are able to get some bags as Ford dumps their huge load on the bulls. Why wouldn't ford wait until it pumps to dump?
F can't sell, they're locked up with the rest of the insiders
No they aren't. Jim Lowe on CNBC just said they are expected to sell
Rule 144.  S1 states a 180 day lockup.  Jim Lowe may not understand securities law
RIVN is the catalyst
99% this sub gonna be overpaying for spy calls when it’s $470+ just watch
I'll be selling them worthless FDs
Today was a scalp the bottom day, then buy puts again. Or just hold profits from last week.
Today I realized that I am more retarded than I thought.
At least you surprised yourself and learnt something valuable
[deleted]
They got a new billion$ contract
Affirm getting clubbed like a baby seal
Tanking SOFI with it.  Motherfucker.  Trimmed my call position a bit on SOFI.
Everyone talking about RIVN and tda doesn’t even show it as trading yet ☹️
Count it down

Hopefully drops in 30 minutes

Gonna be bonkers!!!!
Going to be extra volatile. Just the way I like it
PLTR back to $22 in the free money zone, too easy 😂
If Rivian doesn't tank out the gate, or even sometime before close, the next EV IPO will be valued at a quarter of a trillion.
Imagine just selling 50 ev trucks you are valued at 500 billion
If I buy Rivian at these prices I’m going to get cut to rivians aren’t I?
Buy F now. Use profits for Rivian when it pulls back.
it's gotta fall after IPO right?
most definitely thats why im confused everyone is doing F weekly calls
PLTR how many times have you hurt me
Till you realize you’re hurting yourself
I sold that garbage
Got 25 shares of F in case it spikes
Got 6 $21 calls. Let’s F-in go
I just canceled my $120 limit order for the bankrupt IPO
Rivian is supposed to open at $120 LOL
SPY 469.99 EOD.  Just to fuck the 0dte 470c
Announce the split coward
As of today my entire portfolio is red for all time. I'm not even in dog shit stocks either this sucks
Just a temporary setback man. Happens to all of us. You'll be back and making smarter trades. 👌🏽
❤️
have you ever seen a more obvious bull trap after a bubble than tesla right now goddam lol
Dead cat bounce.
Pls pls pls. I want back on the 🚀🚀🚀
just bought some spy 0dtes, fuck it
Same calls here
Puts. May the best retard win
Need ford to 21 so I can pay off debt pls
Those SPY 471C expiring in 5 hours, what do you guys think about them? an FD candidate? They're only 1 cent right now?
What time does Rivian start trading??
Not telling you
Tell Nemo to fuck his dad
Looking like a ramen day for me again
*yawn* sideways ….
the amount of times PLTR has gone over and back under my average....I deserve to be a bagholder at this rate
Sell calls at your strike lol
I may have been early but so were my expiration dates
SENS finally making sense
Nothing’s moving :(
Spy go green already you cunt, don’t make me sell your ass to the market

Cashed out of SOFI while my shares were still green. Hope I did the right thing
I did also - hoping to get back in on Friday after a post earnings discount
JPow asleep at the wheel running over all my calls ☠
Lmao when I saw cathie added shitton pltr last night, I knew this shit was gonna plummet more
Come on F. Move ya ass
I don’t get it, at $100 a share Ford will have made over 2 billion dollars on their rivian stocks, but it’s still down for the day
We just did it to open I think. It’s annoying when are they going to lol
FUCKING AMD STOP FALLING
MSNBC headline "Is CPI racist? It excludes asian foods."
MSNBC has been drunk on its own farts for way to long. I think their brains are pickled at this point.
Anyone else going balls deep in Rivian the second they get the opportunity ?
Anyone with a terminal illness maybe
Alright. I’m either going to be rich tomorrow. Or bagholding for a long time. 

**$SOFI**
Wooohoooooo!
You buying shares?
Been buying shares and LEAPS since august…

Either bagholding and averaging down or getting rich tomorrow.
Yolo NVDA calls
Looks like retail ran outta money to buy dips
i guess i should have waited a bit longer to buy SPY calls
WHY WONT AMD STOP FALLING COME ON
I guess they do care about CPI
Does rivian start trading at noon?
Looks like it might open at 125? Lol this world is too cray
where you seeing either of those times?
oh i was saying it's open price is being tweeted to be around $125 which i think puts the market cap above Ford.  the time is either 12 EST or 1EST, I've seen both reported
Ohhh gotchu.  Hoping for 12!
alright, if the market wants to go up so much, why won’t it go green?


u can’t explain that
The tides come in, the tides go out
Must buy RIVN!

-homer 🍩
You thinking about putting in a market order to catch it?

Already dropping lol
Holy shit Rivian projected to open at $115
I told you rivian will open at $100+ ($115 currently) , $78 is actually not bad with the guaranteed vehicles ordered by Amazon and they also have 20% stake in it , no way will they trade at that price especially with EV hype where LCID is trading at fking 70B with just a few cars delivered. Up to 100k vans ordered by amazon through 2024 x $70,000 , 7B deal right there.
where do you guys see the valuation?
dear THETA  please rape me. I havent been fucked in a while. yours truly the call taker.
Zuck found a wife in the metaverse. Bullish on meta

Damn, how expensive is a Peloton bike? Just saw a commercial for it and they were advertising it like you are buying a car.
We paid like $2,000 for the bike and shoes and other stuff.
Worlds most expensive clothes hanger.
the crazy thing is you can do 90% of the same thing with any spin bike, a cheap monitor and their videos playing on a tv.
But my wife wanted a Peloton. So we have a Peloton. Sort of like how our mattress cost as much as a used car.
SOFI got me eating my couch cushion for dinner.
Better sell the couch and have water for dinner instead
Rivian starting high hahaha, think a drop will happen? GL out there today yall
when can we buy puts
PLTR, why are you like this ?
Some analyst cuck downgraded it to $16 and everyone started paperhanding
Fuck I shoulda sold my AMD calls at close monday
Same
so many of us in that position mate
MMs are very upset that some of you made money these last few weeks.

They are going sell out of pure anger that you guys did that.
Market makers are mostly machine intelligences and ghee-eating South Asians, they are not going to evince any emotion
Market makers literally don’t think about you at all.

Ok I calculated my numbers wrong. 

BABA is the biggest IPO in history at 21 billion. 

Rivian is 19 billion estimated. 

It’s insane.
Upgrade...BUY OUR BAGS
I get the feeling that the sell off this week is so hedges can go all in on EV stocks next week when Biden signs infra bill
I think Tesla price is going to drop once rivian goes live
Nah, he'll pump it. SEE SEE OVER HERE LOOK HEY YOU
When tesla go down, Ford go up
PLTR needs to just drop to 20 so I can go all in. Stop dicking around at fucking 23-26 FFS!!!

To get out early they have to: **'or 1 week ban'**
Wait so is it 1 week ban or a 2 week ban, make up your mind bot.
Thank god this sub doesn’t know jackshit about real software companies like Unity. no wonder it’s mooned and wack ass palantir isn’t. The wsb curse strikes. so glad unity never gained traction here like palantard
Stop yelling at me. I only have $29.00
wish I got in when it was around $100 for a while, but had other plays I was already in.
It’s easily one of my favorite long term hold forever. It’s got Shopify price action from 2018 written all over it. 

Shits gonna be 1000 plus a share just keep buying and adding. Sucks for options play though since it’s low volume there and expensive af.
Everytime I average down my spy calls it dips further. Never fails.
Any other Palantards and Pelotards still alive?
On life support
Buying calls heavy- I hear no bell
SPY down like this and my Jan SPY puts are down too lmao
All I gotta say is I'm glad I can't trade in my 401k
When your banbet is TSLA to $975 and the lowest it gets is $987 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
All in due time.
Got 200 Ford 1/21/22 $30 contracts on the dip rn.. will print.
Yes they will
Ford will pop when ordering for the lighting opens and it's clear that they can't make enough of them with in the first few days
Not if people become money holds on rivian after it fails ipo!
That's it, I demand to speak to RIVN's manager
SPY V SHAPRED RECOVERY LET'S GO
I need 200% on my calls to break even you know nothing serious
How long
11/19 and 12/3
Guys Rivian is having performance anxiety stop shaming it
Let it tank
PSA: Rivian just IPO
so no options? i wanted to buy puts
Watching the birth of a star is overrated. Watching the birth of a bagholder during an IPO is where it's at
So Rivian goes live and Ford goes Poop?
Crazy right?
Picked a wrong day to buy calls.
Got margin called twice this week
Rivian after hours is going to blow the roof off
Where’s that tard that has 50k in spy calls LOL
I only put 5k but it was 1/2 of my portfolio![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
When rivian hits 500 today. Let us know so i can sell my bag and break the ptd rule for the 3rd time
What is wrong with you people!!! NVDA IS A GOOD COMPANY DAMNIT 😭😭😭
Buy the dip on spy and nvda, thank me later
if institutions don’t buy the dip the fed sends them to prison
On a scale of 1-10 how fucked is everyone today?

Personally for me it’s about a 7. Had much worse but certainly a shit week. If SOFI dumps AH then it’ll be a 10.
0. Made 20% on QQQ puts.

Only mad I didn't buy AMD puts earlier. Would already be up 10% if it came down to my limit price.
I'm trying to tell myself that September and October were worse. They honestly were, but God damn is today ass
Prob a 1. Only down like 1.5%.
boguth rivian at 115 because im retarded
So I took my Roblox tendies and lost double 🤡![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
How do I forget that I sold my puts almost 2 hours ago and pretend I still have them?

Rivian has fucked us, but I’m still holding just incase
Keep buying on the way down. Hold long.
Where are all the idiots that kept saying nvidia going back up cause of earnings.  Told you earnings dont mean shit right now.
I hope it pumps more going into earnings
It aint pumping shit.  This market is fucked cause everybody is scared now of a market crash.  Paranoia is creating one out of nothing.
I would say it’s pretty apparent we might be fucked for a little bit considering the way our economy is going feel free to provide me with a sliver of hope if you feel otherwise
I diversified my portfolio with Rivian + Ford.
Adding more Ford, delicious dip
Lol 2% not exactly a major dip… maybe at that share price?
Up 30% in a month...enjoy your 1% dip lol
Does anyone go to bed thinking tomorrow is my big day?  Market opens, giant green dildo, then after lunch you are bleeding.
I’m holding ford calls. I went to bed last night thinking today was my big day
> The day after the night before.
What the hell is happening? Fucking bears

I bought a put to Hedge against my red calls
Wait til after this earnings call, remember last time?
Mentioning this again but TOST gonna stay above $50 so that 10 million shares from IPO lockup investors can sell tomorrow, that bitch gonna drill to fucking 45 at least. Easy 10 bagger on the 50 puts. Book it.
Ban bet it then
Done
Lol. It's down 10 bucks today already. The real move was puts at open
I was ecstatic friday, portfolio at an all time high... Three week days later, Elon gets me, then PLTR gets me, the inflations kills me.
yeah CNBC, we care about Callaway golf right now
Infomercials exist to sell products

You guys don't make any sense.
Remember to catch the falling knife
MAYDAY MAYDAY
When will it stop? Asking for a friend.
Zoom out a month. It’s got a ways to go still from where it was lol.
We got quite a ways to fall from where we are now. Best hedge out your long delta if this is painful at all
Looking for a buying opportunity. I always “buy the dip” way too soon.

Damn stock market you scary
What the fuck is happening

Is literally everyone panic selling
At this stage I think I'm hate-buying to punishing myself further if thats any consolation
Boys shall we all gather around and play our violins like when the titanic sunk
Port back in the triple digits. End me.
Just lost 50% of my portfolio these past 2 days
As long as I dont drop to 4 digits I'll be ok, took me 4 weeks to get to 5

Fear is also evolutionarily designed to save your life
This doesn't feel like a mere dip
It never does
I woke up and was thinking to myself that I was an idiot for getting bearish again. Now, I'm not too sure. That dead cat bounce, though... The market seemed healthy this morning.
Hello police? I’d like to report a murder. My portfolio is fucking dead
This little piggy went to market and bought four hotdogs. This little piggy went to market and bought ice cream. This little piggy went to the market and bought 10k of actually worthless rivian shares
Oink, baby!

NASDAQ down 3 straight days. Down big today at almost 2%. If I buy month out calls maybe 5% OTM, it will likely make money. But I'm going to procrastinate like last time and miss out.
Month out calls is Xmas tax sell off time
Power hour or dump hour
I am totally broke
Don't worry. Bankruptcy is an option
its aite, just try again next time
Gay bears are extra gay this week.
Just remove Tesla from SP500. Thank you.
Everyone just load on TSLA puts to get this over with.
When SPY is up only some stocks are up but when SPY is down ALL stocks are down.
Tesla just waiting for closed market to shit the diaper
Damn my puts printed today! 100% cash now
"Originally, the CPI was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods. In this case, the CPI was a cost of goods index (COGI). However, over time, the U.S. Congress embraced the view that the CPI should reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living. Consequently, the CPI has evolved into a cost of living index (COLI).  


Over the years, the methodology used to calculate the CPI has undergone numerous revisions. According to the BLS, the changes removed biases that caused the CPI to overstate the inflation rate. The new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution. Substitution, the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes, changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basket.﻿ The overall result tends to be a lower CPI. However, critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a COGI to a COLI as a purposeful manipulation that allows the U.S. government to report a lower CPI."
Is this the end of the world
Only down 43% today, but yesterday was bad.
Anyone going all in on SPY calls?
Elon’s brother good trader called top on Tesla before the poll incident!
Not even gonna cap. Today fucking sucked
POWER HOURRRR
Golden Shower
Pod racing !
CNBC need to get Tom Lee on pronto to tell me everything is gonna be fine.
Tom Lee is crying in the corner. Cannot come to the TV at the moment
For anyone who is saying evergrande rumours are just rumours, there are articles saying some bond holders haven’t been paid even though the 30 days are up. The writing is on the wall.
*looks at writing on the wall*
They paid 3 months though! Haha! Recession canceled! Haha! Don't worry! Smile :)
February 2020 I FOMOed all my money at the peak. Lost most of it in the Rona crash. Spent the last year building my savings up.

This Monday I FOMOed most of my money again into calls. Now inflation cries and Evergrande default are here to fuck me.
Just inverse yourself and you'll be a legendary trader. Puts in Feb 2020 and puts on TSLA last week.
I think we are healing.  Only down 70% now.
SOFI: exceeds all expectations, raises guidance, bank charter in final stages, Leonardo DiCaprio signed as spokesman, new partnership with Amazon 

-45%
*Headshot, no scope!*
Earnings tonight, I wonder if some crazy news leaked or this is manipulation
Who fell for the bull trap?
Went out for a pizza to come home watching a bloodbath. Down 3.5% on average on 14 positions, not a single green. November hasn’t been good to me 😂
Some degenerates bought some stocks. The sell off will continue tomorrow
Two weeks progress deleted in two days. Great.
So today we can claim unrealized losses?
What the hell Tesla. WTF is this
Is it announced Elon musk finished selling?
I have not seen anything.
I swear these past few dips feels like the end of the world is here, but sometimes just gotta close your eyes and buy lmao
So glad i did not pull the trigger on swing TSLA puts an hour ago
TSLA taking this power hour way too seriously
SPY 465.5 EOD
Id probably be up like 10% on my calls, so I'd be happy
the dip will always get bought
Just accept that TSLA is its own thing and will do what it wants whenever it wants
PLTR to the moon any minute now  🤡
I mean it always goes back to 30, but not moon
It didn't even come close to 30 this time and looks like it's well on its way to 20
Congratulations to whoever bought puts on my portfolio.
First week buying spy calls on dips and I’m not sure if I’ll be able to handle another week of this
Weekly expire?
Nah just need it back to 470 by the 26th 🤣🤡
"Buy the dip"

I spent all my money buying the rip
My mom just asked me how to buy Tesla stock lolol

You know what spy you caused me a lot of stress and anger today but I’m glad you didn’t hit 460
didn't hit 460 . . . yet\*\*\*
Guys chill look at my comment history today if that happens I’m seriously going $rope
Yet
I can’t take it if it goes below 460 I’m gonna jump off my balcony
Tsla pumping @ close, this is a dead cat bounce isn’t it, too scared to buy calls, so I turned 🏳️‍🌈 and bought puts instead

I’m ready to scrape the mouse off the road and buy cheap.
What a good time load up on SPY calls
Oh I’ll load
SOFI and Mouse plz have good earnings
If we burn cash we increase our buying power since we have less money circulating
I think you might have spent too much time in meme coin subs.
Ford calls still up but not happy lol
Well, I dumped my calls. Too scared to hold anything overnight now. I chose a great week to switch from puts to calls, jesus christ. If we look like we’re gonna drop more tomorrow I’m gonna jump in some 460p 1dte tomorrow at open.

edit: Lmao of course now we break through another resistance point upwards. God, I’m very full of self loathing right now
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
At this point even if I want to be in calls it was time to dump those. So goddamn far OTM by now that there’s zero chance of even breaking even unless SPY has a +2% day, if we look solid tomorrow I’ll jump in to something that will actually make money if we only go up by a few dollars
GAWD DAMN POWER 8 MINS!
I just need BB to double overnight, is that too much to ask for fuck's sake I mean come on

Projection is real. Love ya babe
Calls on Riot (s)
I didn't see him use his knife once.
If it was COD he would have T bagged the bodies and called in a UAV.
Ford: up 5% in 5 days, 30% in 30 days, and 70% in 6 months.

Drops 1%.

Ford bagholders: "reeeeeee stop crashing!"
Ford still has about 1000% to go to catch the rest of the EV market, given how well they are positioned to succeed vs their competitors and their valuations.
Gotta shed a lot of legacy costs before they're priced anywhere near the other EVs. Pensions, supply chains, sales model. You name it. Ford is finally reacting to the new EV reality, but they have a long long way to go.
Rivian is just like when my dad says he will visit
Damn. Rivian went for a pack of cigarettes.
Rivian is just grabbing a pack of smokes, kid
tesla still green lmao
WSB is better on red days
what good does it do to make money..
Everyone one is expecting CPI numbers to further crater the stock market, so it’ll probably have minimal effect and we’ll trade sideways until the heat death of the universe
Hopefully all the bad news is priced in
Theta gang always wins in the end I suppose
inflation doesnt matter. stocks hedge against inflation, the only reason inflation was scary is because it could cause tapering… but tapering schedule has already been laid out. sell the dip🤡
If you are still long calls in shitty over priced meme companies you deserve to lose your money
Just short calls and yes I do
Largest IPO in the history of earth -

2014- BABA @ $21billion w/ 2014 sales of $8.4b

Now - Rivian @ ~$19billion Existing business? 2 cars per day. That’s what they can build. 

Do. Not. Buy.
I'm definitely buying
Those 2 cars are worth more than all of BABA.

Solely because Pooh bear hasn't assassinated Rivians CEO.
rivian: we're the tesla of nikolas.
Panick selling rivian best financial decision I made all day
Get F or GOEV for more gains
I was doing great until I started trading options like a fucking retard

buying dat dip doe. COINBASE COCKS!!!
By a show of pp’s, how many of you are playing SoFi?
Tesla delivered 260k cars last year.  Market cap 1T

Ford + GM delivered 11 million cars last year. Combined market cap 170 B

Rivian delivered like 40 cars so far.  Wants IPO to give them +100B market cap.   🤡
The market is giving them that market cap. They'd be stupid not to take it.
Buy Ford they got a stake and are gonna come out with billions on this deal
Rivian today is going to be just like that Trump SPAC a couple weeks ago. Jump on and sell at 2
So def sell before EOD?
Biggest IPO in the history of the United States was BABA at 21 million. 

Rivian is looking like it might hit 19 million out the gate. 

With no product. No history of selling a product. 

Right now they’re capable of building 2 vehicles per day.

🤡 market.
Great, looks like I'll go all in on puts.
You can’t buy puts opening day dude
I’m aware
Fuck the market better tank again tomorrow. If I sold all my calls for no reason….

I’m gonna load back up on calls.
Third verse, same as the first
ill take my loss on tesla puts like a man. This stock is just hilarious, not your regular apes pumping this thing from +/-0% to +6% in 30 minutes

Guess who had planned on dropping a $10K earnings bet on DASH yesterday and forgot about it at work?  THIS GUY ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
I was worse. I picked up two calls and used the wrong symbols — DOOR instead of DASH. I’m kicking myself all night.
Oh that's rough.  I can see how you'd make that mistake though.

-sent from bankruptcy court
CPI is at 830am. The question you should ask though is does it really matter? Priced in.
Doesn't really look priced in
I think it's being cautiously priced in right now. So a small pullback incase it's bad and dumps. If it's good we will open flat to green.

No glimmer of hope today before crushing dreams?
Ok so CPI is up again and inflation is at all time high 

Big drop in dollar

So does this mean more money into the market to make up for inflation?
It means rates are going to have to go up, taper sped up, possibly forcing us into a recession. 

That’s the doom and gloom worst case scenario, but with a reading like that it’s more likely than before.
My options gonna expire worthless just like my life!
Don’t be like that. Options have a small chance of success.

Wtf. Arent bond yields supposed to spike with bad inflation data? The 10 yr is barely up. No where close to its yearly high yet with highest cpi in 30 years.
Bond yields going up means 10yr is getting sold off, unless you're talking about interest rate driven yield increase. Price of bonds is inversely proportional to yield. If bonds are getting sold, then money is moving *out* of bonds *into* other things.
Bond prices should spike with bad inflation, bond yield should tank with bad inflation. I am unsure why it is green still
bond market is affected by international capital flows, which are facing much worse bond value erosion in home markets. it's a little bit misleading right now.
Did they lure us back in for a rug pull? Did we fall for it?

"It is debatable whether any of the start-up EV automakers will ultimately be dominant over the long run, especially in a very competitive industry where the traditional automakers are also ramping up EV efforts. However, if a large global footprint can be built with no-cost capital, the 'growth' story will likely continue to carry the day for the stocks," advises analyst John Murphy."

"The bullish vibe is predicated on the ability of electric vehicle players to fund their own expansion through the strong investor appetite for the stocks. On that point, analysis from Murphy and team suggest that a 10% dilutive equity raise for TSLA could fund as many as 40 incremental plants and more than 10M units of capacity, which would make TSLA effectively the largest global automaker."

Bank of America boosts its price target on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to $1,200 and takes its PT on Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID) to $60 from $30.
"We don't think any EV maker will dominate the market. Also Tesla to 400 P/E lmao"

Don't chase which EV auto will win, just load up on EVGO and CHPT. CHPT has the #1 home charger (every house will have one by 2030) and largest distribution of EV chargers in market today. EVGO has the best fast charging and growing partnerships. Grab the repeat business.

Then you have all the commercial vehicles. They all have to charge. That seems to be the end of the funnel.
Sell the picks and  shovels during the gold boom! I forget this is the safest angle
why do you think home charger in every home by 2030? i can see maybe new constructions having it as an option
If you buy an EV today how are you charging it? You are not just going to a public site. You are charging at home as well. Every EV sold generates a charger bought. Fastest growing segment on Amazon alone. CHPT has the #1 at home charger today at least. Every neighbor I know that has a EV has a changer at home. Don't know one that doesn't.

If you live in an apartment or condo, yes, you will use a public or private mass option
thats fair. and im not disagreeing with you here. However, i have 3 main concerns with this, and why electric is going to kill a lot of people, financially. I live in northeast ohio. So this is based of my experience with homes here:
1. A lot of homes have 60amp service from the street. barely enough to run a house, now add recharging one or 2 electric cars. 
2. Old wiring. ive owned a few homes and its all been old nob and 2. the panel has no room for growth in it either. By code you cant tap into nob2. it needs to be replaced completely if you want to touch it.
3. The poorer are going to suffer. Gas is only "cheap" because of the qty we use of it. Once electric cars start making into the norm, gas will be astronomically high. Poorer people cant afford the gas, cant afford the price tag of electric cars, nor can they afford all of the upgrades to their homes electricity.

Now i could be completely wrong here. i am big enough to admit that.. i just feel that without government stepping in for grants to improve home electric, it will be a long time before homes all have chargers.
Something to look at and it's actually another business model that is growing but it's a local level business benefit. For a 40amp levels charger, you only need 50amp breaker. More the faster though. Overall, level 2 on need 240v and amps needed are all broken out. 

https://www.chargepoint.com/drivers/charging-101/
tsla gonna allow other ev cars to use their charging stations. From what I hear around the watercooler their stations are way better. I also hear that chpt stations r crappy poopoo stinky stations.

y chpt? 

never looked into evgo tho so that one could be better. I don't own an ev btw.
EVGO has an awesome product. Stock is killing it. 

CHPT will win as well due to distribution so much bigger today. It's level 1 & 2 so they need to get into fast charging faster. But, CHPT sells the software and service as well. That is key. Look at he Georgia Power partnership.
Only SOFI can save my portfolio now

yeah that's the thing that's making me apprehensive for this play
Well NVDA just took a fat dump. Great.
This morning; “if I had only sold TSLA when it was over 1050”
Now; “maybe it will moon”
Could’ve got out for break even on NVDA Calls now back to -1k
Theta Gang sends its regards…
The first rule of Theta Gang is we don’t talk about Theta Gang …
In project theta gang, there are no rules…
Smooth sailing today!  Plus an exciting IPO to watch.  Chin chin!
\*Ring ring

"yeah, NYSE? Yeah, it's me. Can you guys turn down the difficulty? Thanks."
CNBC would probably interrupt a state of the union address once Rivian opens. They so thirsty.
LCID gonna have a nice run up to earnings or what?? Getting annoyed losing money every day…
It has more than doubled since August..how much more of a run up are u expecting??
Lucid is up 14% in the last 5 days, up 88% in the last month, up 130% in the last 6 months, and year to date is up 328%


If you aint making money on it, maybe stocks just arent your thing.
We’re not talking 20-30 percent. Just needs to stay flat with a little 1-2% bump up so I can make money on some options. Not 4-5 days of solid losses. That’s all I’m sayin.
Fighting all the emotions to exit my NVDA calls for a loss even after analysts bumped the price target today and earnings being next week. I know this stock will continue to rise but it sucks holding in the meantime.
Playing earnings call, eh? NVDA could shatter records and it would still probably tank the next day.
Fuck yeah hurt me Lisa Su. You know I love pain baby that's why my portfolio is 75% long leveraged AMD
Gains went poof
Did Elon sell at 1200 and rebought at 990?
Kinda wanna go back in on META
dont. it sucks here

I double downed on NVDA again
Bought more PYPL 🥵🥵🥵
SPY how could you do this to me
PYPL cheaper than dirt on a stick
Huge upside potential $230c is a play for me
should have a bounce to 226 by Friday we’ll see
Yes…I’ve been buying it up
AMD how could you do this to me
If someone can take a pen and stab it through my eye and into my brain that'd be great. Just doubled down and threw 15k into my MSFT calls 10 mins ago
Nice dude , I've only lost like 6 figures trying to double down on losing calls over the years , I'm sure it will work out great for you though 😊

Anyone hear the rumors of discord going public?
Lmao more weirdos on there than any other company

Putterinos
Nah they going to surge if it happens
No but pls share. I want some discord
Yes but that’s been the rumor for like 8 months now.
But only since the 9th that the SPAC has been involved
not really, IPOF/Discord rumors started couple months ago its just no one cared about SPACs back then
Smart idea
NEGG you get your fuckin ass to $50
TSLA took me from 8k to under 2k yesterday..... back up to 3k now. I don't if I should hold or just sell.
Hold
Just sell. Markets will be more easy to predict next week bro.
Thanks I feel stupid I gave back everything.
Dis calls before close?
Before and tomorrow morning
Clearly based on news events and price action today, $TSLA is a hedge on inflation
AMD 150 EOW
Can we do 155?

Sam?
So I'm down 65% on a SPY $480 12/01 call. The losses have blown through my risk target, but I still feel bullish. Apes, talk me in to holding this option.
Don't
12/01 is a while away, but 480 is ridiculous. theta gonna pound.

I have Feb calls for 475 and I thought that was a bet.
Yeah, it's probably time to sell. That was a directional play while the market was bulling last week... I didn't really expect SPY to get that high, I just wanted to profit off some green days and flip it. Now I'm just chasing losses.

Well now I've just talked myself through it and it makes sense in my smooth brain. Thanks ape.
Ive got 11/24 473c

I'm with you.

Sell for 40% loss or hold until next week where we could see 475, IMO
It's rivian Man. The whole market is holding onto cash waiting for this bull chit. Soon as everyone does their little fucking day trade spy will boom again.
Ouch, I'm holding on to some 12/03 485 but I'm scared. I decided to yolo 1/2 of my portfolio in to spy calls on Monday. I panicked and bought a put today and I'm currently losing money both ways. I think I am going to hold till Monday and see what happens. In the meantime I will probably recommend some put?
Why is the market drilling wtf!?!??
the US 10 year is spiking like a bitch
Me and the homie are breaking up a 12 inch slab of concrete right now with a jack hammer
Bought Ford calls $22.50 12/23 am I fucked?
Yeah you are, cuz then u only have 1 day to buy Christmas gifts with those gaaaaains
Yes
I bought F calls $23 11/26, I think I'm fucked

I think you may have some hope.
Really depends on your cost basis at this point. Could be fucked
Well I guess everything's going to just go back to how the day started?
The market is just in a silly, goofy mood today.
Investors are obviously confused


The bond market?


Suddenly certain.
Disney up o.5% for the month spy up 8%
What’s the most y’all would pay for Rivian at open today?
$1.25
9
You know the market is 🌈 when u/cashflow_ is making money in the market
goddamn amd fucked my ass
It's gonna be crowded behind Wendy's tonight.
Why Elon doesn't just buy Ford?  Offer them $40 a share in TSLA stock, how could they say no?  Absorb all of their patents and production capacity, eliminate your #1 competitor, and diversify your business, and you'd even have a functional electric truck.
Because nobody wants to also absorb all their legacy costs from unions and retirements. Plus tesla doesn't use car dealerships.
What does he need that old shit for?
Jesus ford
U just made bank F. U r going the wrong way.
RVIN off to a good start
I have done enough IPOs to know that its better to wait 30 days or so
Fukin Ford
Dow is down 1% from all time highs.
It’s the apocalypse!
Well there goes all my damn gains after stressing every second lmao
Buy spy, have nothing to lose
Who’s buying Tesla puts ??? 🤑
So is ford not mooning?
Huge rivian pump was priced in dipshit. And no rivian pump was had.
the old, hide the selloff under a hyped IPO strat?
LET THE WILD RUMPUS BEGIN!!!
Bought spy puts at the absolute dumbest moment early this morning and now they’re profitable
My portfolio is a fucking toilet today 🚽
Rivian is turd sandwich, watch this close at 110 and sideways for a long time, not seeing the hype as promised, its falling short.
It’s amazing how I can buy calls at the EXACT wrong time
SPY down 1% in 2 days & im down 25% in my portfolio can you isn't please
I literally wear the same thing every day
cartoon character
this much red on this low volume is concerning
Well Bagholding ford calls now. See y’all in vahala
Vix acting like it's a green day
My Portfolio is undervalued.
Fuck rivian there goes amd and nvda
You are their piggy bank. Thank you for your service.
Slow bleed all day.
how fucked are we SOFI bros
Not looking good before the earning.

Lot of bad publicity this morning regarding of how they handled the Rivian IPO althought it wasn't SOFI's control. 

I"m gonna ride it out with my $20 Calls.
Vivian about to pop off like dwac
That would put it at 1T
Undervalued
Held F for 20 minutes lol
FB ripping my ass wide open
Wtf. I leave for half an hour and one of you guys tank the market
I blame the treasury auction
Then we like this for a lil longer cus no way the budget balance at 2 gonna get us back up
If my trades dont work, imma just epstein myself 🙃🔫
Is ford dipping Mr. Markets way of saying it doesnt think RIVNs valuation will stick? Because like if it did Ford would be like 5B richer in the last 15 minutes yeah?
The value of Rivian means nothing to Ford until about 6 months from now when they can actually do something with their stake.
They can sell today if they want.
There is no lockup for their investment.
From the S-1:

>**Lock-Up Arrangements**

>All of our directors, executive officers, and the holders of substantially all of our outstanding equity securities have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to sell or transfer any common stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for, exercisable for, or repayable with common stock, for 180 days after the date of this prospectus without first obtaining the prior written consent of the representatives on behalf of the underwriters. Upon the expiration of the lock-up period, substantially all of the shares subject to such lock-up restrictions will become eligible for sale, subject to the limitations discussed above. For a further description of these lock-up agreements, please see “Underwriting."

If you think Ford is subject to those "certain exceptions" I'd love to see how that's the case.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000119312521289903/d157488ds1.htm
So if Rivian is valued at 100 billion … SpaceX will probably be worth an easy quarter trillion.
If SpaceX went public it would be 500B…. The demand for that would be disgusting
> If SpaceX went public it would be 500B…. The demand for that would be disgusting
And TSLA 2T by this time next year
Sold 20 shares of rivian at 120 for 400 bucks profit I'm good I think really don't want to fomo back in
dont go back in, take your win
Cathie in fucking shambles
She took my RBLX calls with her.
Thats what she gets for selling TSLA and PLTR and buying HOOD and SNAP
This is a rowdy sell off, holding for power hour later hopefully
ahhh yes, the casino has the gay again....
That was the bottom load calls on SPY
Short ladder hedge attack against my portfolio SEND HELP
Nvda and amd raced to the top now they’re racing to the bottom
I'm turning off the screens and looking away from this sea of red.
RIP F I hardly knew yee
Yep. Bought puts at the bottom, now it's going up.
wait for it
RVIN giveth and RVIN taketh

Fucking hell this thing is all over the place
bought a starter position at 100. will add more on way down. i don't see any logic behidn this going up. at elast for short term.
Don’t see any logic in it going up but you are entering a long position and planning to add on?
i bought a short position. my bad. i sold short.
The market turned to red since Burry returned

I have no idea
AMD can't possibly go lower today, can it?
Narrator: It did.
amd new price target by analysts 145 to 180
I hood so
Fear uncertainty and gout
Rivian rug pulled itself
I'm really glad I own SPY call leaps instead of FDs
Fuck it just doubled down on ATVI leaps
Why?
It has been excessively beat down because of near term issues (game delays, HR problems) that will be resolved in 3-6 months. Currently trading at a P/E of less than 20 which is ridiculous considering the new Call of Duty just dropped a few days ago and several more blockbuster releases are on the horizon. Expectations are super low and they will blow out the next few quarters sending it back to $100 or higher next year.
Not a bad idea. It’s been beaten down pretty bad. Which date and strike are you buying?
January 2023 $70c
Word, I might buy one. Thanks!
Also from looking at the chart I’m pretty most of the sellers capitulated on 11/2. Trade volume that day was highest it’s been in 5 years there was more selling than in March of 2020. Also weekly RSI is the lowest it’s ever been. Fuck I just talked myself into buying more.
Yes that day had insane volume. Lol nice. I’m thinking about buying one
Rivian bro we got to cocky
This is the end F
BREAKING: China’s Evergrande has officially defaulted, DMSA prepares to file bankruptcy

Is market actually dumping or only the stocks i am holding?

my shit getting rocked
18 shares at IPO and out at 110. Blessed.
I blame rivian
Retailers are donating their wealth to Rivian shareholders. Such a nice gesture.
Not even down 2% for the day, you’d think there are halts down the way some people talk in here lol
1% drop for the people highly leveraged in calls will destroy them
these people are retards, son
Classic wsb
was up 50% on U calls and now down. fuck today
Buy that AMD dip🤤🤤
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/InspectorDabbit87 (0/1) made a bet that FUBO would go to 35.0 when it was 29.698 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
WHY THE FUCK DID I YOLO NVDA AND AMD WEEKLIES ON THE DIP YESTERDAY I DESERVE THIS HELL
No rivian. You scumbag. Just kidding. We all knew this would happen, right?
Yep. That’s why you go in with half then double down
Never thought about doing that. Makes sense. Still learning. Thanks.
Me too and I’m 42 and still making lots of mistakes but staying in the game. This is an amazing long term play
This is FUK WOW.   What is happening to FB and NIKE.
Have you looked at the entire market? Lol everything is down

Cash gang when inflation is 6%? Makes no sense lol.

Who's got two thumbs and is getting assigned?
I’m not convinced spy’s gonna be red much longer it’s just not it’s thing
Wait until a -2% day that’s the fun part
If you bought at 119, mod applications are up there ⬆️
SOFI earnings better be very very impressive.

Did you not see the month of October? Were you not entertained?
If my previous experience is correct the next hour and a half of the market will be a massive push up to wipe out everyone who panic bought over priced puts.

How is evergrande defaulting bad for US stocks
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
China holds a lot of American debt
signal for other china property developers could default, debt default contagion in general
blackrock and other whales have billions in chinese debt, if it goes bust they have to sell USA stocks to cover
Almost 50% of USD EM bonds are like 5 companies, evergrande being the largest. Contagion already seen affecting the other ones. Not to mention the size of this. Us markets exist in a global community. Just look at the hit iron ore has been taking alongside evergrande default risks. And im just talking about the last 24hrs here. Its also not a good time for a bubble to burst. Not with the inflation read we just got.

Btw not bearish. Not going cash. Just hedging.

Well time for puts
Always was
I just sold my puts, SPY 470 wasn’t clear enough? Now I hold cash and wait for a bottom signal
Looks like AMD broke through 139 . 💀
There's money to be made today.....just too stupid to see where
It’s obviously not Palanturd, my fellow Palantard.
I find it hard to believe this will be the real crash, too many people are aware it will be more of a surprise factor during the next run up
Not that it matters one bit. but agree for sure. and i have puts today and am up nicely. i think we rebound some early next week before/if a crash actually comes
just the tri-annual conviction test
Down 1k after being up 600 ok

I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS THE REACTION FOR INFLATION. IF PEOPLE SELL BECAUSE OF INFLATION WHERE THEY GONE WORK THEIR MONEY TO PREVENT THE EROSION FROM THE INFLATION. THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME
stocks are the worst place to be if the fed is not printing money / raising rates

youre better off losing 5% in a year than losing 90%

dont underestimate how large the fukken bubble the fed created is, once the printers are off next year we are bigly fuk

still too early to sell with all the QE but investors gon panic
Where do we go?
to walmart and buy yourself a bear suit

or if you decide to be a bull without QE, buy some vaseline for your asshole

its too early though to panic over rate hikes, we still have 6-8 months of QE left which is a shitton

id start worrying around march next year
I am not panicking and I do not understand why people panic now. The Covid behind us and I don’t understand why people act like fucked up
>The Covid behind us and I don’t understand why people act like fucked up

Stock market is dependent on fed printing money

When they print it goes up, when they dont print it can go up but its much more difficult

COVID doesn't matter, it is the fed that matters and people panic if they think the fed will stop printing or go against the stock market
They are gonna leave you holding the bag and buy back in cheaper
The drop was due to Evergrande defaulting entirely. People think it's a Leman Brother moment, but China somehow. Yah overreaction I think, if you haven't been following what goes on in China borrowing for construction has been stupid and unchecked. This was naturally the result of over building. Doesn't mean the same thing is happening state side.
just a regular correction from market makers with only 39 mil volume

Sold off all but one in case it continues to tank. Not a bad profit.
Fuck it I’m holding wish me luck
Godspeed my fellow ‘tard.
Is the market tanking due to inflation/bond yield worry or Evergrande default or both?
> Both.
who is still in tsla puts... we bouncing tomorrow or more drilling
Closed them at market open; but dang are we heading to crash. Why everything is going down.
drilling, we ain't seen anything compare to the market
imagine selling your puts on the fake pump around 10am
😪😪 i did a stupid
I buy tesla puts, it goes up, makes sense
The SPY short ladder attack is over
tell that to my 59% return
Another day where every move I make maximizes my losses.
Don’t move on these days you monkey
So…..unrealized loss is a thing now right?
Everything red. Slam laptop shut.

“you can’t hurt me anymore SPY”
I have a pillow on SPYs face, I whisper softly in her ear “it’ll all be over soon.”
Ah looks like Evergrande actually made the bond payment. This time
#🎶 ALEXA PLAY BULLS ARE FUK BY MOZART 🎶
Give me the next leg down
I hope the Mouse comes ready to fuck after close today
Looks like Evergrande defaulting is bullish for nvda
It’s so hard not to be emotional while trading. For example, I will probably never touch PayPal again because of that retarded stock
I’m dumping that fkin thing as soon as I break even. Absolutely autistic of a stock
Not with that attitude. $290C 9/16/2022 Let's gooo!!!
power hour is a fucking lie
not even the last hour yet
wait 2 mins
I'm from the future there is no power hour here
I was on such a hot streak and now I’m down 20% today on my entire portfolio 😢
You haven’t lived until you’ve done 2 DTE SPY Iron Condors
👊👏👊👏👊
I’m fuckn bleeding out make it stop
so glad I got my vix calls when they were $16.
This ones terminal leave him and move onto someone you can save. Sorry son.
Idk about SPY overall but TSLA and NVDA look fucked
Is F going to close above or below $20? Can someone please tell me because at this point I can't afford $rope.
Why would you buy F in the first place?
Who the hell is buying Tesla today and at these prices
Musk
All fucking day.
**CATHIE**
I’ll buy most things that are 30% off highs
Well it’s not sooooo you def belong here
Lol it's only 15% off all time high and still up 30% in a month off of nothing
Evergrande defaulted today.  RIP markets.
The only thing stopping me from $ROPE is knowing I’m not the only crimson red retard here.
Dip buyers sitting on their hands knowing a pullback at least to 50dma is a pretty high probability event
Worst power hour of the month approaching.
It's not the best choice. It's Spacer's Choice
SOFI AND AFRM WHAT ARE THE PLAYS???
SOFI make me wanna SODIE
No clue not my brand
guess this electric skateboard craze was all bullshit
Too bad we could buy puts on day 1
Wait so China Evergrande never actually made a last minute payment on it's Bonds that the media reported on a few weeks(?) ago. What the fuck...
I was thinking the same thing. This whole market is a lie.
they made the minimum monthly interest payment, I believe. Not the actual amount due
[deleted]
Burlakacoin?
U actually bought some chin chong chiang coin at a gyna website? 

U deserve to lose all ur money
what kind of racist bullshit is this? I think you deserve to lose all your money tbh
Damn musk really called the top perfectly
I mean he's the reason it IS the top
Regardless of yesterday it would have plummeted today anyway
Well. Liquidated a few positions sitting high up on the rsi.  Let this thing cool off a bit and I’ll come back and scoop it up.   Bers enjoy this while it lasts.  Spy coming back to fk u
RSI still needs to come way down. Thinking is hard though, cause it could bounce again like it did in September. So we found have more bullish sentiment through next week.

But I think before December we get a bigger pullback over a couple of days. Then it will be time to buy calls

No

Great - I can do some coke to straighten me out

I think we have one more day of this unfortunately
that's what the bears want you to do.
More puts on $TSLA, it would take 300 years for tesla to pay for it's stock and one tesla car doesn't cost 2 million dollars
what exp and strike price?
Have any of you involuntarily been turned into long term Rivian investors?
> I'm not a long term investor.
VisualMod, did you panic sell already?
I believe I have, tried to buy calls ended up with shares. it all happened so fast
I mean, it’s just money, right?  RIGHT?!?
I’m not super upset as my calls are out for January but man this sucks
Mine are 12/23. Just sucks to sit here and watch! FML over 60% down on AMD & NVDA
It would be terrible is SPY ended the day flat 🤡
Do you know the definition of Insanity?
Buying TSLA calls during ATH?
My QQQ puts expired worthless on Friday, so this week makes perfect sense
Next time do sqqq they’re up shares
Amd was the talk of the town yesterday. Today she's just a cheap whore
My portfolio is a loser today! F AMD NVDA LCID SNAP

Ughhhhhh
SPY Calls already up 16% still time to hop on
Bears are going to be back to eating bugs from under their step-mom’s doublewide and drinking above-ground pool water by Friday.
You mean eating bull 💩 for nutrition
Holding SPY options when you’re down is essential
AMD doing a big cumback
AMD should be equal to NVDA super undervalued
YO WTF TESLA

tomorrow probably going to do one of those quick dips to test and the rocket up and then chop all day
Hope Opendoor got a nice fucking EC otherwise it’s my ass that’s gonna be OPEN
all these fucking dips and yet none of my put options are part of them. I can't WIN.
**O SHIT it's the fuckin Sega Genesis**
So this is what happens when AAPL and AMZN down on the same day.
It's days like today that make me wonder if floor traders ever threw hands over someone being a bear/bull while everyone else was losing ass loads of money
Im praying for -10% WISH after earnings
What if they announce a 30 billion dollar buyout?
30 million? 😂
That might work
Odds of WISH bombing to an all time low AH?
What, it'll become a legitimate penny stock?
Gonna be a penny stock
Hope everyone got their WISH puts locked in. Up 47% on my 11/12 5p
RIOT with great expected earnings
When are there earnings
Looks like Friday as of right now
Down 5 percent lets gòooooooooi
Wednesday bloody Wednesday
God damnit NVDA, make up your mind:
Either correct down to 290 or rally to 300+
I really need 290 by tomorrow morning
It'll do exactly what shakes you out of the trade

I work 6 days a week and I get paid less than 8 USD converted per hour
Forklift drivers get paid that much or did you find a unicorn?
Congrats brotha. Don't forget to take some time off every once and a while.
Thanks for clarifying, thought it was real money for a sec.

Ah its kangaroobux. Still damn good though
Damn, gotta have to move down there. Congrats!
Jesus did everyone here buy nvda at the top??
Nah, AMD.
And Tesla even after Elon tweeted the poll 😂
🙃
Sad, I was talking about NVDA in October. I sold around 295 for a nice gain. Felt dumb selling, but now reading here I think how it could have gone for me and I am happy.
Technically in the grand scheme of the universe *all* inflation is transitory
hEaT dEaTh of UnIvErSe is aLsO pRiCeD iN.

Remember all these stupid fucking "macro-economists" at the Fed and elsewhere saying inflation would rise modestly in the spring of this year and dissipate over the summer?

😂😂😂
> I do not understand the question.
Imagine if jPow was a firefighter. 

"those flames are getting pretty high. Another 12-18 months and this will be concerning"
It’s just a transitory fire
Tsla back to 1100 EOD
I picked up some FDs in addition to my leaps, stupid ass strike but who knows. 100 of em for .035 each lol $2000 strike
not a bad play haha
Retail investors salivating at the prospect of being able to hold RIVN bags.
How many cars has Rivian made?  42? 
Valued at 100 billion 

Tesla makes 600,000 a year? 
Valued at 1 trillion. 

Production numbers means tesla is undervalued needs to be at least 10 trillion.
That would make GM and F worth........

Never mind
Ford should be the largest company in the galaxy based purely on truck sales.
Yeah buts not electric so it doesn’t count.
Nah, they gonna get that growth speculation on electric trucks.
I like what Ford is doing with EVs, but they just can't compete on margins with TSLA.
TSLA only has the margins it has because it doesn't have to compete. When literally one car came out, the Ford Mach-E, Tesla's share of the EV market dropped 10%. Now imagine what happens when everyone is pumping out EV's and Tesla is just another car company.
TSLA has maintained market share of the EV market at ~18%. 

> TSLA only has the margins it has because it doesn't have to compete.

This doesn't really make any sense. They're already at price parity. Are you saying that TSLA only has triple the margins of Ford because TSLA can charge a higher price for their cars right now? I dunno man. Don't think we're gonna have a productive discussion here.
They have no downward price pressure because the competition hasn't ramped up. It's coming next year.
Ford is in massive debt

Theres "im.growing a business" type debt and then there's "we took a big government loan to bail out our shitty company and now itll take 100 years of selling trucks at our current pace to pay it back" type debt
Here comes the usual WSB smooth brain who thinks Ford Credit is "massive debt."

Except you also think Ford got bailed out. Ford never got bailed out.
Ford took on a massive government loan. They made a lot of noise about how they wouldn't need a bailout but it was all PR. they recieved lots of government assistance and are still trying to pay it back.

Also yes their debt is massive right now.

"According to the Ford Motor's most recent balance sheet as reported on July 29, 2021, total debt is at $146.92 billion, with $100.91 billion in long-term debt and $46.01 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $22.95 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $123.96 billion. "
They have the capacity to build ~150,000 a year currently, production will ramp up very soon. Sooo that puts them at a 250 billion valuation based on your logic
TSLA makes 1,000,000 cars per year... well they will for 2021 at least.
Come on rivian. Open
Need a Trump tweet ☹️
Imagine still buying GME and AMC 🤡
No no no, *this* time 300 EOW is gonna happen 🤡🤡🤡
Fucking broken clocks amirite?
buying at peak
With today's drop, inflation is fully priced in.
Only up from here
Lmao but it’s probably true
Sub in shambles, too bearish buy calls. This is DD
VIX calls with various expiries are good insurance. Probably expensive premiums now, but 20c's tend to be reasonable when its around 15
I was going to buy Rivian but even I am not retarded enough to buy at this valuation
i’m retarded
If SPY could go ahead and open at 475 that would just be great
SPY 470C FDs, fuck man.
I thought I was good buying 468. Sold today's at a loss yesterday and still have Fridays
TSLA puts printing all week

Green by open ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
What’s img?
Man, maybe I’m doing this wrong. I’m out here reading 10Ks, cash flows, and trying to find fair value price, and here comes Rivian who hasn’t sold one car and it’s more valuable than the big three. This market rn 🤡
Not gonna lie, I stopped reviewing that stuff. This is all momentum and macro catalysts.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Perhaps that’s the key
Yeah that's mostly boomer shit. In a raging bull market what's most important is buzzwords and momentum.
Look at Mr. Dr. Big Brain over here, knows how to read
No need to lie Rivian has sold and delivered customer cars already. The valuation is nonsense but no need to exaggerate.
Haha not having unions is worth it alone
Union labor is only about 6% of an automakers costs, so technically it is not worth it 🤷‍♂️
You forgot the pain in the ass factor
F GOT IN RIVN AT $7 LMAOOOOOO…F is going to cash out and go to $100 easily
Let’s hope

I make fun of JPow more than anyone else but I am glad everyday we don't have a recession. Most of you are too young to remember 2008 and how an entire generation of college grads were forced into poverty. He has to address the inflation but he is the driver of economy in one of the most bumpy part of the road.
I remember 08.  It's why my mom rents an apartment still.
Yeah that was super cool. I graduated in March 2009

even goober kawasnooker sold
Damn well I bought 340 shares yesterday, I’m retarded
31 year high inflation. Buy stocks or forever be poor
how many times will TSLA halt down today? I think it goes to 800
Has Elon sold his shares yet or do we not know.
I’m just talking out of my ass, really
At least you're honest about it lol
CPI is gonna be bad.

I know, because I am holding calls.
The worse it is the better for the market
Every time Powell says "transitory" you have to take a drink.
Can SPY please not tank because of Elon..
Oh it’s gonna, if TSLA goes down y’all are coming with em. *cries*
This has very little to do with him
Umm are you retarded? TSLA is part of S&P a big part.
1.5% of SPY. -10% on TSLA = 0.35% move on SPY

I think that's how numbers work I dunno  


Edit: nah wait, it's more like 0.15%
Market of stocks
TSLA would be seeing this movement without that Twitter poll. It ran up almost 50% in a month. A pullback is healthy.

The stock market was literally made for bulls. Puts can only lose 100% of what you buy them for. Calls have infinite potential. Bears in shambles
Your calls bout to lose 100% of what you bought them for
That 1060 put I bought at open is still up 600+%.  But who knows come 930.
I don’t really trust the FED or the Biden administration with CPI data. In Obama’s book he mentioned that he would under sell the financial crisis to Americans because he did not want to cause panic. Trump even said that with the Coronavirus.
Under selling in a presser is one thing, cooking the books is another thing entirely
[deleted]
Both will be chopped up and act like they didn’t see it coming.
Well stocks will bounce back up.

CPI looks bad to me as a consumer, but as an investor CPI = Calls Print Instantly
Ok so let me see if I’ve got this right:

High CPI means 

Equities go down because it is pricing in rate hikes sooner than expected/hoped (even tho inflation is actually sorta good for equities)

Bonds go down (yields up) because it is pricing in faster tapering and the dollar losing more value over time

Corn/gold go up because of inflation hedge narrative

How’s my macro?
Buy GLD
Lol… buy corn.

Yeah, sorry bro. We grinding up the rest of the day if I had to bet on it. Oh wait, I did bet on it.
Lmfao bears, why even fight it anymore?
Elon fatfingered the order and sent it as a buy order instead of a sell one.
Inflation the highest in 30 years.  Yet the FED and this admin continues to say that this is 'TrAnSiTorY', or that it really isn't a problem for American consumers.  The FED needs to immediately raise interest rates NOW.  This bubble needs to be deflated before it gets too big to contain.  The crash in the stock market, housing prices, and the overall economy when the FED raises the interest rates will be painful but temporary...for now.  The destruction of wealth and incomes due to inflation is far, far worse.  Get this shit under control before we turn into a 1980s-1990s Japan and the problem gets so out of control the country will be fucked for decades once the FED has to raise interest rates anyway.
I already have my $17 bag of popcorn to watch hyperinflation happen again in my lifetime.
My guess is your armchair economics is better than the fed

agreed, what a fucking world that a tweet from a legitimate autist can create or destroy billions in value
Elon to the gov: see? 1 rich guy selling 10% and the market goes bust, now imagine the 700 richest selling stocks so they can pay 40% of their unrealized gains

Yeah he's the reason I bought PRPL. The will be two big losses on a row right? I remember him losing big on options last time.
AMD and NVDA were supposed to be the promise land all week right?
With how much AMD rose this last earnings report, I don't think its surprising for it to dip a bit as people cash out. Its still a longer term play IMO.

You trolling? I got 335 and 340 and I'm cool as a cucumber. Market will bounce back. Couple red days are good for the market. Good chance to buy lower strike calls too
I get a bit nervous once my calls are within 40 dte
Lol nah bro you’ll be itm this week
Bloomberg giving the pump!
Trying to figure out if WSB is bearish or bullish on SoFi. I want to inverse
Yes.
It's turned from Bullish to Bearish after other Earnings dips this week. Earlier I was thinking I'd cut what I have in it this week and look to buy back next week. 

Then I saw what Dash did after everyone here was Bearish and I'm almost convincing myself to hold.
I’m trying to figure out people’s sentiment on it. DASH should have been so obvious. Everyone here was buying puts
Anyone use TD bank? Looking to get rid of capital one and already have a TD trading account.
I have been with them foe many years. Personal and biz, I think they are great. But then again I get my trading advice from here.
TD Ameritrade is nice and has good analytical software from what I hear. I do not use as I’m a simple retard I need to see my confetti and get conned by Robinhood. I worked for TD Bank for 5 years and I’d never open an account there because there target base is just sucking a 5.99 monthly fee out of poor customers. Worked there for 5 years full time and 1 customer had 7 digits. 1. TD Bank and TD Ameritrade are 2 separate entities however and not connected at all except at the corporate level
They’re not affiliated if that’s what you’re getting at. TD Ameritrade is a Schwab product
Did not know this. Shows how much research I’ve actually done into this. Lol
Between U, PLUG, & SPY, I think I'm screwed.  My only hope right now is SOFI, which after the way the market responded to yesterday's earnings, I don't feel very confident about.
SOFI was never kind to me, I can show you on a doll where it violated me. *points to wallet in back pocket*
It’ll probably go sub-20 after earnings, because almost everything has tanked after earnings.

I have 25 $24 PLTR puts for 11/19. What would you do with them. Break even $23.54 it’s currently there pre market. Hold or no
We will probably tank for an hour or two after open. I’d sell then
I noticed PLTR generally goes up at the beginning of the day or not at all and generally surges around 12-1 and 3-4.  Obviously lunch hour and power hour but still
I'd probably sell at least 10-15 of them around open. With the market being this red I'm assuming premiums are going to be pretty high in general.
I dont see it going much lower. Had good earnings and outlook and is at fair price.

You would be the person to know.  Also it’s crazy that in the future people will be in debt cause of trying to live a digital life and be in digital debt cause of trying to live a good digital life.
Looks like futures are bearish on CPI for now. Hopefully we get something surprising and not a boring day.
Maybe buying SQQQ yesterday wasn’t a totally retarded idea
If only I could figure out options; I could lose so much money!
That's the great thing!

Honestly, should have bought QQQ puts rather than SPY puts yesterday
sqqq calls. come to the dark side. I'm jacked 2 someones tits
not too late if you buy right at open probably but idk anything so

So are Live Nation puts free money? They're going to be sued into oblivion and the price is still way higher than last week.

I knew it was going to be one heck of a day when I heard Crammer gave people “permission” to sell everything.
Not sure how this day will end but to start down $12k and now only $300, it’s a win.
we just started but yes

i was down 25% now just 10%
Today is a good day not to look at the market
When your 3k loss is only 2k 😎
I think Rivian’s trucks are sick.
But it’s a super weird market segment to hit. Construction workers will buy Ford F-150 lightning, luxury SUV buyers will still buy Land Rover, bmw, or Porsche, and true outdoorsy people will continue buying 4runners or Subarus.

I think after initial sales, the company may struggle unless they can release a $35k outdoor vehicle.
I agree with the strange market segment. I want a truck to do truck things with. The Rivian truck seems to be almost delicate in all it’s luxury.
I don’t think many people want to take their $75k SUV out in the woods to take on damage and scratches.
You assume company value has anything to do with the stock price. (See TSLA)

It’s all about getting in on the hype and then cashing out.
The charging tech and skateboard chasis are where a lot of the evaluation comes from. Fords already using the chasis with Lincoln. 

EDIT: Nvm Lincoln cancelled the skateboard tech in April.
I worked on skateboard tech at Stanford and have a published paper… rivian’s isn’t that advanced or special compared to other companies

Here's a tip: VLA (the french biotech company Valneva)

Here are some facts:

\- Whole inactivated virus covid vaccine currently in phase 3 study close to official release

\- Today they signed a deal with the european commission for 60 million doses over the next 2 years

\- Phase 3 study shows higher efficiency than Astrazeneca

\- Broader immune response not just to the spike protein specifically like with rna vaccines but to all parts of the virus, making this future proof against new variants and a great choice for a booster

\- Can be stored at room temperature and normal refrigerators unlike rna vaccines (less costly and good for use in third world countries)

\- Production in UK, Sweden and Austria

\- They work on two more promising vaccines for borreliosis and chikungunya which don't have an existing vaccine for them yet

\- For the borreliosis vaccine they partner with pfizer

\- Steady growth in the past year

\- Recent capital increase (opening to the american stock exchange, 2 ADS = 1 stock)

Higher inflation means put your money into appreciating assets. Why would high CPI even bring the market down?
Higher inflation means people need more money to buy stuff. Sell stonks for purchasing gas sincd its bouta be 5$ a gallon….
More pressure on the fed to raise rates and all that other stuff
Higher inflation generally means higher expenses and higher costs of capital leading to lower asset prices
Because the fed will have to eventually raise rates and the continued increase in inflation means that it has to happen sooner than later.
So what you’re saying is get as many student loans as possible and dump it all into the market
Yeah. Duh. Inflation will either continue and it will be worth nothing anyways, or you’ll lose it all in a totally expected but equally unexpected black swan event that crashes the market. You’ll be a WSB legend no matter how you look at it.

I’m really the worst trader ever.  I’m down 30% in the last 2 months.  Still up for the year solely due to one meme stock play and buying internet funny money in January and holding
Just another day I wish I could go back in time and unbuy all these PLTR shares and bought literally anything else and held it
I’d know PLTR does this shit, but what the actual fuck is going on
The only way to trade PLTR is to buy around $22 and sell at $26-$27, repeat
Wait so I bought COIN at the top?
So is GM going to be the big loser in the upcoming EV wars? Only thing I ever see from them is that Malcolm Gladwell commercial.
Toyota isn’t doing much either
Toyota is low key partnering with AAPL
But the Hummer lol how practical
I doubt it, because they actually sell cars as well as trucks and have just as much scale as other larger manufacturers.
They'll do okay with Cruise
NEGG bag holders ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Nice ballsack and handle forming on $pypl
Oh, so U do know TA 😂
SOFI calls
Worst part about this PLTR dump is that, according to available short sale data, no substantial short positions have opened up this week. Meaning this entire selloff is just people dumping shares.
Still a possible long term hold?
It’s an opportunity for me to buy more shares. 

PLTR is a long term hold for me. I’d only look at medium/ long term plays.

LEAPS AND SHARES
What time is the Rivian IPO?
I can't figure it out. Everything says "sometime today"
Just put your limit order in
F volume almost at daily average already. Shit's gonna get spicy.
Whoever said gipr was a four bagger. Shouldn’t be allowed to breed.
This is ass I need rivian to open trading
SENS is actually doing well after earnings. Looks like folks are loading up for FDA approval
When is that expected?
By eoy, according to the ceo. A lot of interest in January calls for a margin of safety.
Inflation is transitory just like my back pain
You may have osteoarthritis
Rivian and Expensify IPO's today?

I choose the one that is only *slightly* overvalued, instead of the one that is RETARDEDLY overvalued.
Anyone in DKNG?
Shares and LEAPS, 1/20/23 $50, $55, and $70. I think it's a growing industry, obviously, and worth holding through the dips.
I bought 2/18 calls today (5 days after superbowl) and want to add more
Unfortunately yes.
just calls and they are nice and red
The year is 2021.  All stocks worldwide go to zero as shareholders take the proceeds to invest in Rivian.  RJ Scaringe is elected planetary President-Plenipotentiary by unanimous acclaim.  The flying saucers land and the aliens declare humanity's Flawless Victory.
Just bought some 22.50c 12/3 let’s do this

Edit: Ford folks
Ford
Yeah I can get behind this expiry and target
Alright one red day is enough time for another 7 day green streak Bull market until the end of time!
Evergrande is on the verge of defaulting.
China isn't real
Never was...
Get in the 🤡🚘 everyone, it's nice and cozy here
when does rivian start trading 😬😬😬
COIN PLAY WAS TODAY 
EZ
Are they trying to scare us in to virtual currency? Cuz I’m sure you can’t put coins in a strippers underwear.

Virtual currency is sexist.
They will have QR code tats of their wallet address
IOU’s on your drink napkin will have to do from now on.
Sell ROBLOX or keep it?
Sell, it will keep dumping. The pump already happened
I am very bullish on RBLX long term, but I sold half my shares yesterday and half this morning. I think it’ll come back down
SENS baby let’s gooooo
This is peak boring.
EVGO you little slut you
The great thing about about having INTC instead of AMD is that it doesn't go down much. The bad thing is it doesn't go up much either.
Amd goes up a lot
Good SPY you break that 467 we’ve got money to make
Amd oversold yet?
Look at the 6 month chart. It's got a long way down at some point.

Probably back to 120-130 before it breaks out again.
My spy calls are slowly dying....
my puts as well
Mine too! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
IS anyone getting into rivian before it opens???
Heres what happens, all the wall street types get in at 78. Then retail comes in and the price is $120. Retail buys while wall street sells making a quick 54% gain and leaves retail holding the bag.

Then over timw the stock drops to 40s where it belongs
i mean, it’s not gonna dump.

at least no according to UVXY


if Uvxy randomly jumps green then i’ll start worrying
Anyone up on prog calls for earnings
Yeah baby
Anybody still bagholding onto WISH hoping for a ER miracle to they could unload their bags and run to the emergency exit needs to know there's a million other suckers thinking the same thing.
Well I feel targeted with that statement
Your $WISH is my command. 

🧞‍♂️
$ELY is so undervalued. Top golf and sex after, name a better duo
Sold half of my Ford calls, see if I can't pick up a couple rivian shares for a gamble.
Let’s go SENS
Ok so now we enjoy being fucked by theta.

Cool
It’s almost obvious $PLTR is being held down. Their ER was actually decent. Watch it go to $26+ before we know it
🤞🏻
**Fun fact:** Microstrategy made $5B profit from *b i t c o i n ,* more than its own net income since 30 year combined.
They sold their shitcoins?
Not sure. these shitcoins worth more than the company LOL
If they sell, stock falls. If the creep falls, stock falls. 

Not a great spot to put your shareholders on imo. The CEO is a joke
amazon is said to be doubling down, buying more shares of rivian at open https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24017625/amazon-doubling-down-on-rivian-ipo-what-investors-need-to-know
I think AMZN will eventually buy them out. 

This will be their EV play.

Wheres all the people that bought dash puts yday
[deleted]
i thought my qqq puts were goners for a sec
Anybody mad at nvidia needs to realize it went up alot in the last month.  And after that dip nobody is buying shares, only people daytrading calls.  Unfortanately its gonna keep dropping.  The same thing happened in september.  Give it a week or two and should start to up again.
Earnings are coming up dummy
If earnings mattered at this point it wouldnt have dipped this bad since yesterday.  All other real stocks not meme stocks dont dip like this before earnings.  This isnt a meme stock but unfortanately being treated like one due to popularity
It's systemic. Some things are just unavoidable
So NVDA has great support at $300. Might go in on leaps. I’m tired of looking at daily charts.

CLOV is oversold
Ok the swings on the spy are insane
I may seem to be losing, but in my culture habitual trading losses are seen as a sign of high status and virility.
PLTR back to 22s again like clockwork.
Rivian is waiting until lunch time before IPO goes public. That's why DASH was up yesterday. Everyone will be getting food delivered today.
THETA EFFFYOUUUUU
buying calls on spy cause i know after lunch it will moon . its a fake dip .
I’m in heavily on $SOFI $OPEN. Will either be cheering or crying later but either way I’ll be drinking!
Buy some puts just in case you get fuboed like me.
It will either be a $30-50k gain or loss LFG
Lucid gonna have a good earnings report or what? Been a lot of positive news for them lately. Idk if I should hold my dec/Jan calls through the er
Bruh im just tryna watch anime these IPOs need to open so I can sell em lmao
I’ve never hated AMD this much in my entire life. Figured I’d day trade expecting a rebound or something. Nope. Now my weeklies are fuckkn dead

Anyone buying calls on open?
I did 11/12 $21
God their expensive.  Lol you can buy stock today as sell the 20$atm call and get 2$ expiring in two days.  10%
No one is. Options won’t be available for a couple days.
I mean $OPEN
Well fck u 2 Mr. Market
Lol of all things the dollar is up after the inflation report? 

That’s why we have SPY languishing with VIX staying down.

Might as well go to a normal casino this makes no sense
Red days are just rumors, buy the rumors
Is it just me or does CNBC have fewer commercial breaks on interesting days?
They get paid by underwriters of rivian 😂
I didn't realize that
Whole entire day is about to be for nothing fucking ridiculous
I maybe possibly should have sold RBLX

almost the average volume in for the day aleady and its creeping up. Maybe the shorts are going to start to cover they are up big on that ride down from $60 to $30  would make sense to get back to somewher in the middle. I threw some chips on it.
Why are they fucking waiting so long?

Is the "anticipation" supposed to make people want to buy in more?

It just pisses people off.

Bought 11/22c on spy at open. What a rollercoaster though i just lost a few thousand. Instead it's back to zero and profiting now. I'm go throw up. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.
My fellow non day trade pattern traders, following the market trend and getting time will help you one day break your limits

Nothing feels worse than when a stock you just bought turns red immediately and stays that way for days.
The moment you sell it will go up. You are the chosen one.

Yessssss
Just wait until earnings. Someone's gonna be GUH. Might just be me with my puts
Yep, sad I bought the dip Monday, all I was hoping for was a nice little earnings run up, now praying for a miracle
Thought I had great entry on the Ford dip yesterday. Once again, I am proven wrong almost immediately.
When earnings suck, stock go down  
When earnings good, stock can still go down  


Has there been a case where earnings suck but stock go up?
Roblox
Rblx went up with good earnings  


I meant has there been a bad/terrible earning but stock still go up?
Last earnings for Roblox sucked. Tanked on the call then mooned the next day
Should have sold my F calls this morning. fml

Get a job dummy
Im 13 years old
For one, you shouldn't be here, two mow some lawns. Or get whatever the equivalent of a paper route is nowadays
How do you get low unemployment numbers with reports of high labor shortages?
Stagflation.
Because unemployment takes only takes into account people that are both willing to and actively seeking work. It doesn’t take into account people that aren’t bothering to look for work. The great resignation is a very real thing that the media is skewing.
Unemployment isn’t who doesn’t have a job, its who wants a job but doesn’t have one.
Because they are framing 'people not willing to work terrible jobs for non-living wages' as a 'labor shortage'
This market is about to get real bearish whether you want it to or not. EG gonna fuck the whole world up

Guess I'll diamond hands these NVDA calls expiring this week.
Let’s be brothers since I’ll be holding these AMD calls till next Friday as well.
Same. Pretty much already at 0 for me so might as well ride it out til friday and see if i can recoup something. At least we have two days left![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

Gotta be big dumb to buy Rivian at open price. Market cap is nearly as big as a car company that has been making cars since the invention of cars.
So was Tesla
there is literally no reason to buy zoom stock
any growth stock. legit freefall.

its disgusting

So uh, what happened to make such big dumperooni?
Hot inflation led to rising bond yields and evergrande officially defaulted
Yeah but that was at like 10 am, I mean in the last hour or two
TA showed sp touching a major resistance line, passing it is a bad idea, retracting like now is better cause is more natural and healthy
Call your boomer loved ones. Let them know they are loved.
Not seeing a catalyst for this much selling
You serious? Yields are up like 12 basis points, Evergrande defaulted...
Evergrande has been defaulting for over a month; it’s not news.
Bond markets are tanking. Bonds are always the canary in the coalmine. Pay attention to them, especially if you're trading large caps.
Aside from the fact we've gone up vertical for a month with no pause at all.  NVDA up 50%.  NET up 100%.  MSFT/GOOG up a ton.  Due for a day like this.
Guys there’s a error on my robinhood, it says I’m down 30%?? Anyone else, weird glitch and also it says spy and nvda are down for the day?? What the heck
Now own 3 companies with RSI below 30. Too fucking funny

I just found out that I got a 10% raise just because my job code changed. Apparently this new job code is associated with more pay.
Fake reason, company is trying to retain staff and using that as excuse for raises of the ones they want to keep without pissing off others.

“We cannot let the bears have this market.”
man why does inflation matter now when we've been ignoring it for months
It doesn’t.  Evergrande is defaulting.
man thats old news, nobody cares about that anymore
Nah bro.  That’s why SPY is taking a fat shit right now.  They missed another payment on the 6th after skating through the end of October.  There’s a $70 T hole in the world economy formerly known as the Chinese property market.
Xi's commie funny money will fuck all our buttholes
Holy fuck AMD
This might break $460

LMFAO AMD under $140? this is a joke right? legit retarded blatant manipulation with the amount of open interest for Friday at $140 fuck this shit man...
Bro its up a billion fucking percent already
some retards are getting wiped out today for sure. please post your loss porn

Taking a break see you in a week when I have money to play.
Does this mean tomorrow will be green?
No
Gonna bounce back hard tm or next week. Hold tight wait to buy the dip

Indeed. I miss 6 figure swings. I really miss tanker gang and negative oil.
Y’all know this means red November right
Wow this selling pressure is insane

I am loaded with cash now but too afraid to buy anything I currently own because it’s all retarded

And what did we learn about leverage today, class?
AMZN getting dicked down
The bounce will be swift. Bears took back 1/2 the gains from last 3 weeks. Chill
Lol, what? SPY climbed 8%, and we're down like 1.5% from ATH now

Why is amd tanking like this tho.. like where is the rebound
AMD was up **52%** in a fucking **month**.
panic sell baby!
I instantly regret selling my tesla puts
I had a AMZN 3590 Put today that I sold because It looked like a flat day. Bought for 39.00 worth 110.00 now ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)🤡🤡🤡🤡
LOL I had 30 465 Ps I sold too early
Same had 4K into them. Let someone talk me into fucking calls this morning
Well I made 20k could of been 40 about 15 mins later LOL
I sold half Monday night too. I’d be up 20k easy now
I can’t wait until tomorrow when everyone doesn’t remember today.
It can't stay down, right?

Right guys?
Just threw all my dry powder at jan 2022 500c SPY.

I've seen this trick before, stocks fuckin go up.
I was doing so well until today
No way people are taking profit after a month of green everyday.
and tesla isnt even red...

this market is total aids
Yet
Nice to day trade TSLA
I'm a boomer investor who put money in SCHD.

I'm up 0.14% today, cya nerds later, i'll be on my yacht
there's not going to be a power hour you stupid slut
Can they close the casino early plz
tell me you're over levered without telling me you're over levered...im over levered.
we all knew a 5% pullback was coming, this inflation print might be what triggers it. highly doubt we sell off more than that until we get a signal from the Fed that taper/rates will be accelerating
Couldn’t agree more. Until something changes this is a dip and buying opportunity.
rolled over my puts to 5DTE 388P on QQQ. went all in. im so retarded
Thank god I bought puts. Not like it really matters tho
bye money, it was nice knowing you
I feel like that dude on the beach in Dunkirk.
It would be crazy if Sofi drops to $19 but jumps to $30 ah post earnings.
well on the negative side, my calls are already down from the peak (but still way in the +++) ... but on the positive side, if the news is bad then they wont rape me quite as badly.
Or zeroooo
Ow my gains
OPEN is now CLOSED.
Wow what a terrible day to be a trader
Trade puts
Too late now missed the train
my spy puts would have been a 10 bagger if I didn't pussy out

F to that guy that yolo’d 50k on spy calls.
Holy duck the market is actually just dying
Except COKE 🤡🤡🤡
I had just  about recovered from the September bullshit.  Is it the inflation numbers dragging everything down? I would have thought that was priced in by now
Pain, I like it rough, pain, I can’t get enough
Ford hurting me so good.
I’d rather feel pain than nothing at all 🤘
Scalping boomer stocks = ‘rogaining’
Yes!
At what net worth can you buy a Patek Philippe and it’s not cringe
when you no longer need to ask
Think higher the net worth the more cringe
Nah. Cringe is people with only like $1M that spend 5% of their net worth on a watch.
I think it’s alpha as fuck when they have a watch worth more than their house
When you can buy it cash and not feel too bad about it
When you can afford one lmao
Any poor with $50k can technically afford one so you’re stupid. Next.

i have to believe that the speed of this dump happening before 3pm would preclude some semblance of a relief rally for power hour

but who knows, maybe the chart will go down so far and fast it actually reverts back across the Y axis and goes backward in time
Progenity is about to make me wet
CPI was well known to come in hot (even tho last night I said I had a feeling it would be low). I think most people / the market in general were looking to find any reason to sell and take profits after all the green for the last month. It felt too good to be true so ppl wanted any reason to go out and CPI was the reason even though it should have been expected
Still worst day of my life but I spy a little red boner

I just fat fingered sofi and bought 1000 shares. Meant to buy 10. Please tell me this is a good buy.
Earnings later, I’m holding puts… good luck
Omfg are serious lmao

I just bought a lottery ticket. Any idea what the earning are gonna look like? It's already down 9% in the last hour.
With iv this high, is there any way to hedge this so close to earnings?
Should I use a day trade to get out or what?
Can’t give financial advice, but I’m terrible at options and I bought puts. All I’m saying, good luck homie
It’s not time yet…  you will see $14 soon.
Im sorry little one.
Fuckin DASH tho, literally just like fuck all of you I'm above $200
you have calls?
No, one worthless put I bought yesterday that's down 98%
Who the fuck is propping that piece of shit stock up
I have no clue but someone with deep fuckin pockets
Everything with good earnings that wsb has calls on 🔴

Dash: eat my dong stupid nerds
Iron ball bulls like me buy the dip. I’ll catch knives all day long. Stocks go up but sometimes they go down but then go back. Why pay rent when there’s a dip to purchase.
I remember there was a South Park episode that said the economy was retarded and nobody knows how it works and that feels correct today.

surprisingly I have a few things in the green still.. MA and STEM are even higher.
My long hold account is getting murdered like everyone else's but I went cash gang in my short term cash account this morning, with the exception of one ticker - BABA. I'm not usually this good.
Time to go cash gang and wait for this shit to collapse, I guess.
Not even one little put?
See you tomorrow
Just remember who did this to us when it’s time to enlist
Vix goes reeeeeeeee
can anyone give the tl;dr on PLTR earnings? Is this a dip worth buying
Government revenues down, significant portion of their earnings. Commercial revenues up, could be due to their investment in the companies they work with. COVID earnings spike for govt contracts may be dipping faster than expected, harder to justify 30%+ CAGR
gov revenue wasn't down, that beat too from what I remember. Some analysts "feel" they won't sustain gov revenue
nice. Thanks guys!

opposite imo

What good news is left?
that there is nowhere else to put your money
WISH earnings lol
Is this the end of the monetary system as we know it
This is a healthy correction imo. Tech/growth stocks have been climbing at an unsustainable rate for a while and a small correction now is better than a huge crash three months down the line
A nice V shape is forming
I’m at the bottom of the V right now
Damn all my stocks basic bitch followers

To the tard machine! Buying the calls 🤑
 My SOFI holders, you guys holding through earnings or we selling ?
Sell. Too risky... If they go back up, I'll bite and buy back. If not, I'll buy the dip. If they pop, oh well.
Holding and praying 🙏 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
💎🙌🏽
I need SPY to close above 470 today...
Good luck amigo. The ship has sailed.
Was I a fool to listen to that open DD?
If spy ends green today for some unknown reason. I will quit, even though I have bunch of calls
Spent 1k on 11/15 spy calls at $2.03. 

Idk why
well youre on this sub so i guess that kinda explains a little bit
Feel bad for the bulls to see them have their hopes raised
Regardless of rebound the Clovtards still will be red
They shouldn’t have pumped spy so early. Power hour actually starts 30 minutes before close.
Wow. I have learned a valuable lesson that I haven't learned anything
Pump bitch, pump
TSLA is unstoppable...
Imagine if we go full 2008 and the spy trades flat for years after a 40% dip

Wonder what Cathie gonna load up AH today 🤔
PLTR 100%
Bought Dec $170 $DIS puts for earnings.
WISH puts have been printing but my other moves were too retarded to overcome today
My wish calls printed also...guess it's mostly IV
Expecting more bears when I opened the chat. People still seem pretty bullish in here
The bears warned us
A receding tide sinks all ships.

-TSLA, probably
Sofi will skyrocket after earnings. I feel it in my plums.
I have lots of calls so most likely not. Sorry sir or madam
Had some change left on my account, bought Disney 150p weekly. I mean, how else do I lose everything?
WISH couldn't even wait. It went ahead and disappointed before earnings were released.
And during earnings it’s gonna exceed expectations
We ain't even overheated yet, got to get to like 495
and here I thought inflation was already baked into and accounted for. 
Because its been a thing now for like 2 years.
I don't think it's the inflation #s.  We're due for a pullback just looking at all the technical analysis.
We've been due for a pullback for 2 years too
Is it too much to ask for AFRM to hit $40?
Yes
COME ON MOUSE DO SOMETHING
Mouse better die after earnings
buy SPX puts on close, sell at market open
Because……?
BYND has to be a miss right?
One would think so, never know tho with the libs eating all that plant based shit
Well at least my fake internet coins arnt doing this bad

Tesla’s catching on fire in Florida here we go
Pray for anyone who is holding Tesla overnight, the stock is hanging on by a thread and people are risking so much for such little potential gain. Got to be GenZ buying tsla here
Praying TSLA plummets 🙏
I'm not going to sell and incur that much taxes in November. I'm stuck with my tesla because even if it drops back down to $800 I'd lose less than if I had to pay taxes on the gains.
Prepared for some big moves in afterhours. Up or down who knows but there are shenanigans afoot.
FUBO PUTS LETS GOOOOO!!!!!!!
Today has been a rollercoaster for my portfolio. I want off at the top please.
Mine was too just the part where it drops and you wave your hands in the air screaming.  The whole day was that part.
I just bought and opened a position in $BUD.  Gawd knows this market has increased my Budweiser drinking so I might as well profit from my increased consumption.

Why are so many people seemingly interested in Rivian? They look like ass, and fully specc'd it's $100K. Who wouldn't just buy an F150e?
To say you have a Rivian, more than likely.
It’s like the size of a ranger/Tacoma as well. So not really same class. Not very appealing imo either
That Amazon partnership seems like it would be lucrative.
Didn’t Amazon order something like 100,000 work vans from them?
They look damn good imo. And the inside is all decked out. Rivian for trips and outdoors, EQS for style. Bugatti and Koenigsegg for speed. Neon or bright colored Lambo just bc.
Headlights are so 🌈
Why wouldnt you just buy a Cybertruck is the real question. Its bulletproof and doesnt look like a plastic garbage bin.
They will eventually make all of Amazon’s vehicles
Same reason ppl were interested in the orange SPAC last month.  Pure speculation, you think WSB posters are interested in fundamentals? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

TSLA gone be back up at 1200$ by end of the month
End of week please
STOP FALLING NVDA HOLY FUCKING FUCK
It’s only begun 🤡☠️
It’s also falling after excellent news yesterday. It’s a cash grab for today’s IPO. NVDA will rise after they pump and dump Rivian
Alright tsla that’s enough go back to sleep now
Why the fuck do I keep buying calls on earnings day
You should buy before n sell at earnings day
Play the iv ramp up. I've had luck with this, works even better with strangles about a week before.
I thought I was smart selling my PLTR calls and going balls deep in shares before earnings. Still hurts

Fuck it’s about to get ugly boys
Okay, so puts are the obvious play. I'll have to inverse that and buy calls. However, me inversing puts with calls is already priced in. Now that I think about it, me knowing that inversing my inverse is priced in, I should buy puts, but I already know I'm going to inverse my inverse because it's priced in which is already inversed. I'm not going to inverse my inverse priced in inverse because inversing that would inverse the pricing in of my inversing.

I hope they bring their bush back
That seems to have been back for awhile now. 

In hindsight, that was probably our best leading economic indicator.

High 420 IQ: Buy ford who owns 102 million rivian shares.
Should buy both to be honest. F investment in EV ahead of GM and whatever Chyrsler calls itself these days, not to mention Japanese competitors.  Also someone traded their tesla for a mustang SUV in my neighborhood so anecdotal evidence is strong.

Rivian maybe isn't worth shit in 5 years.  Might as well buy in hard now, forget about it, and then be pleasantly surprised.
Wen rug pull? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Hopefully soon lol
Ford you fickle bitch
Rivian is going to tank because I don’t like the headlights
Too friendly, I need mean headlights
Everything will pump in about an hour and a half. You can quote me on that.

I bought a brand new civic in June for 24k. Car max offered me 28k to trade in. 

We’re in weird times when cars are appreciating
Maybe finding their intrinsic worth. Maybe you got it while Honda were still offering discounts. Was a brand new Japanese car bought during lockdown worth more after a couple thous miles when a third lockdown was breaking and supply lines were jammed to f\*? Well it's worth what someone's prepared to pay for it.
Just break under $1k TSLA. We all know it's gonna happen.

Inflation skyrocketed today , oh well the market wil make up for it by going up higher
We are witnessing the making and unfolding of the Greatest Depression our nation and possible world has ever seen. Its still in the early stages too. Lol

That’s bullish. Most other EV companies make zero

Ford has been doing well with EV’s of their own lately. 

This is just a clown market.
Ford knows they will be in business long after rivian is gone
Yea that's why Ford due to moon
Ford just waiting for IPO and then too explode
Fords market cap is 80 billion right now, and owns 102.38 million shares in Rivian. If Rivian hits $150 that would be worth over 15 billion in Rivian shares alone.
to fall 7%
"Oh, they just made $10 billion on their Rivian investment? Better drop 7%!"

You need to cash out those puts my man.
priced in. already up 40%
Up 40% on an earnings beat, revised guidance, dividend reinstatement, and a debt repurchase. Their Rivian stake when it hits $200 a share today is not priced in.
Wallstreet really shilling hard to dump this Rivian garbage on retail
Total fuck job
Bro I am straight up not having a good time
TESLA is trading at a steep premium and has a fair value of $250
Imagine selling 45 cars and getting 100B just to IPO on the fucking nyse
Amazon ordered 100k vans
Ordered but they wont be produced till next yeae
so what. they still sold it.
I don’t trust Rivian. Waaay too much hype and big numbers out the gate with nothing delivered. Big contract deals but they haven’t proved anything of scale. There’s a lot that can go wrong. I think most analysts priced them at 20B and that’s probably taking into consideration a VERY positive outcome where they deliver on their promises to Amazon.

Also I think the hype beast is probably the hopes that Rivian proves success in a few years and Amazon goes from 20% ownership to a complete buyout. And afaik maybe Rivian gets sold through Amazon’s platform. There’s definitely a lot of positives here. I’m all for speculative plays but buying into Rivian at 100B feels like a huge ploy to fuck with EV retail traders.
Lol Reddit is getting real aggressive in pushing people to install their app ahead of their IPO. There is a 0% chance I'm downloading a Reddit app to my laptop. If anything, they should be paying me to post here, not stealing my private data.

Down 12k today. Time to pull out. Use the money to pay off credit card debt and return again
Green by end of day
RIP my entire account, It was fun to see a lot of money all year up until my mistakes in October spiraled out of control. Never thought I could lose $70K so fast. Now I will embrace depression, and wage slavery. I might return with $5K and see if I can gamble it to success. Or I might actually rope; the world does not need more peasants afterall.
I’m down $40k on the year but at least I have a cool flair ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
That's a rough flair, my dude
That is the problem with options brother.  Keep away from them and keep your 5k in your pocket. Go the boring ETF road. There is no getting rich from trading for us, these are fairytales for normal working people.
I'd rather gamble it to be honest. Mediocre life is tiring -- I am not interested in watching slow growth while slaving away, losing my youth, and in the mean time there are fuckers out there born into wealth. The next simulation might be better.
We need as many peasant slaves as possible stay strong pleb

Yes lots of founders/CEOs borrow against their shares, except there isn't really a public co of this SIZE where a a single holder owns almost 25% of the outstanding shares, almost 10% of outstanding shares are owed to debt and that debt will have to get serviced...
How do they fund other projects? Meat and potatoes?

RIVN @ 78/share

Are you fucking kidding me??? Hard pass for now.
Oh

Rivian wants to price in at 1T 1200 per share

Coz inflation it seems
Sounds right, 0 profit and a billion dollar cash burn loss this year. Watch it run to 1500 lmaooo
Right? Crazy high for basically zero revenue.
zero revenue very bullish
I agree. I think this is going to end in tears. Part of the reason Lucid's SPAC predecessor entity took a big dump was unrealistic valuation. How a 70B valuation for Rivian makes sense truly escapes me. Ford's market cap is currently 80B after a pretty remarkable run-up.

Time to stop bond purchases and raise dem rates JPow.  Pump game is over. You cant push the Fed balance sheet to $8T without repercussions
you think this is because of the fed balance sheet lol
Jay probably would like to step out and let someone else handle that
And crash the market like it's 2020?
unironically it actually is transitory imo
Yea like all them economists at the Fed and elsewhere telling us prices would rise modestly in the spring and dissipate by summer right?

Even though China PPI now at 13.5% and rapidly accelerating still?
idk if there's a way to put a timeline on it but the fact that China PPI is going up suggests that it's still pandemic related supply chain issues which will be resolved rather than a US-centric problem all the inflation fear mongers make it out to be
Idk man, all you people keep saying it's transitory.

Now it's smashing a record at 6.2%.  Commodities are **double pre-Covid** for many business inputs.  This doesn't feel short-term unless the Fed acts.  Supply chains also take time to resolve, especially semi-conductors.

With the labor shortage and surging wages, this WILL get worse until Fed hikes rates.
the magnitude does not imply transitory or not stop using that as a measure.

supply chains do take time to resolve, that's what transitory means.

unemployment falling and payrolls are being added, the global economy is still operating below capacity, supply chain issues will eventually be resolved and supply will shift up to meet demand
Ok but at some point, when you keep saying "transitory" but transitory means a long time (when we were told it was a few months) and wages start to have an effect in a feedback loop it becomes irrelevant as a term.  See what I'm saying?
>wages start to have an effect in a feedback loop

what do you mean by this? are you suggesting there's wage push inflation?
I mean… the 1970s didn’t last forever… I guess that was sort of transitory too… 🤷‍♂️
comparing this to the 1970s is fucking retarded lol
At levels this high, yes. But I don’t know if being accurate about it being transitory is better than being accurate of how high it’s going to go.
it is definitely better. hyperinflation is not coming to the US. Stagflation is not happening. inflation will slow when supply chain gets worked out
Loopring, check it out.
LOOPTARD
You know what else is transitory ? My chances of ever owning a home ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)

And then tomorrow is the day the avg down
This $RIVN IPO is massively, greedily overpriced, I hope it flops.  It could meet all expectations for the next five years, and still justify only a fraction of the price.
I agree. But i am sure it will fly above $100 today.

Be patient. You'll have a margin call soon enough.
I really hope Ford just sells their Rivian stake today on this crazy value. Could get over $10billion cash and do any number of productive things to grow their own business.
They'll make that much selling cars next year.
I don't think we know anything about a lockup on their shares. We know they vacated their board seat on Rivian, though.
They’re probably in a lock-up period so don’t get too excited. Buy calls for March-May or so.

 NVDA (up $100 in a month): Drops $8 in one day 

WSB:  REEEEEEEEE
Yeah because not only do they buy the top, they buy the top in calls.
It's down $30 from open yesterday
if you bought NVDA yesterday, especially calls, you kinda deserve this
No one listened when I said buy monthly calls when it was 220.

But when it hits 300+ it's time to buy.

I love this place
Dropped alot more than $8
if you bought yesterdays top like a fucking autist yea it did
It was over $300 last week what are you taking about?
over 310 for a combined 4 hours yea
Rivian fuck you. You bloodbath every fucking thing
Stinks like bear in here

as soon as 830 hits SPY will hulk cock to 471 then steady pump all day to finish at 473

$RIOT $40+ pre-market. Bit is all time high. Last chance to ride some easy gains
Riot wants $45 today
Im seeing an easy $50 looking at Maaaaara and bit and how momentum is shifting towards $RIOT
market already doesnt care 15 minutes later. lmao
Inflation is going to make us all millionaires. Thanks JPow!
will be good for when those millions buys a single car :(
If Nio can’t hold above 40 I’m fucked pray for me
At least the past two days I had some pre-market and opening gains before I got fucked. Today I'm getting killed pre-market. This is really awesome 🤓

No, that's Tesla closing!

For those who bought the 19.5C on F 11/12,  congratulations.  F and Rivian day.
SPY you have my permission to go green
6% inflation and SPY is going to go green, lol
The market doesn't fucking care BRRRRRRRRRRR
Well the market is a good hedge for inflation. Where else are you going to put your money? Gold, silver, real estate, bonds, a bank for that juicy .25%? It’s the best play for return on investment simple as that.
Oh i know, we are just going to get so screwed when this thing collapses, lol.  But going to be making bank until then
#Sector rotation into cocaine and hookers

AMD gets new billion dollar contracts, AMD releases new microchips.. stock goes down.... wtf???
It’s literally smoking every chip stock this year in terms of gains besides nvda.
The stock has been on a 40% tear. People are going to take profits
"The Big Short" of our times is this fervent belief that some people have that the entire auto industry will be taken over by startup companies and that some of the world's largest and most powerful manufacturing, distribution, and marketing organizations somehow have no way to compete, and are totally clueless.

We'll see.  I'm betting on Detroit.
Lol no way, the dinosaurs are too stuck in their old ways. They'll never catch the dreamers who don't know any better

Than they'll become dinosaurs, such is the circle of life
But the "dinosaurs" have hired lots of young dreamers who are eager to electrify their favorite auto brands.  GM, F, etc are full of young engineers who believe in an electric future and are working on it with tons of resources behind them.
That's why I'm long af on F, and just trying to play EV bubble with lcid/rivn

Will I still chase the 1 day runs on startup EV companies?

RIVN indicated price of $125 is retarded. Just buy F as they sell their shares and AMZN who owes 20% to be a winner.
someone explain how RIVN IPO will make F fly? because this is sounding extremely retarded
If ford sell their stake at these IPO prices, they will have made about 10b dollars profit
Rivian is going to IPO at more than fords market cap lmao
Ford owns 12%
F has ownership in RIVN.
F owns a 12% stake in them, and their valuation is fucking insane
I think you explained it clearly….how the hell does F fly because little baby bezos wants to be Musk.
Ford owns a large chunk of Rivian, enough that the IPO opening at $125 would mean that their Rivian holdings are equal to about 20% of their current market cap. They won’t be able to sell off their shares immediately due to the quiet period, but they will for sure sell them. Buy March F calls.
#The market is a 100% science based, autist MMO

We’ll see how I feel tomorrow lol
Wow stonks go down

Checking in on this
Rivian pickups are kinda ugly tho. I believe only socks and sandals wearing dads would buy them.
I am a dad, however I do not wear sandals or socks and prefer a $F EV Truck

I actually kind of like them, and I’m not someone who normally likes new vehicles. I almost always prefer the older body styles until the new one grow on me.

how do u know
TSLA felt threatened by a company that makes 2 cars per day

Probably cuz Rivian is made up of the same people who scaled Tesla up 😂. [Look at their hires.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-05-18/rivian-s-former-tesla-employees-lead-debut-of-3-new-electric-vehicles)

Over 100 senior positions at Rivian are ex-Tesla people.

Now they have $20 billion after the last private round and this IPO and no debt at all, plus a 100K van order from Amazon to guarantee revenue. And they’re building stuff Tesla doesn’t yet so they can get a foothold where Tesla doesn’t have one.
The end is near. SPY sitting at ATH’s while the whole market is shitting it self
Fakest red day ever. We know inflation is high and evergrande aint new. They gonna milk us and close green this week then set up the opex week bloody mondey scheme they been running since may

My strategy with PLTR, wait for it to go up virtually any amount and then immediately buy puts for 3-4 days out. Easy money.
I like to sell put spreads after it tanks. 21/20p a month out usually pretty safe
It'll be different this time©

Fuck SOFI…. Like went up then is tanking before earnings. My calls are so fked. Now the only question is do I hold and hope the earnings or good or take my 50% loss…
Wait your telling me a stock can go up AND down??? No wayyyyy
> Yes, it's called volatility
Wait wat??? Stonks only go up…
Gonna average down into earnings and come to grips with bagholding for a couple months.
I think I’m going to hold as well. They expire in December so I can only hope they announce the bank charter finalization. Fuck this weeks earnings plays have destroyed me

Set reminder in 6 mo… if I’m wrong I’ll zelle you $100.(only this bozo)
Shit, I like those odds.
one problem corn has is the age spread. it takes a couple dozen 20-30something tech guys with $20k in corn to finance one 35 year old dude's early retirement. When the rest of those 20-30something dudes hit the stage in their careers where they feel confident enough to retire early (cuz they can always come back as consultants or w/e) there's a risk of having too many outflows and not enough inflows.

whereas with gold, most of the investors are actually dead and only alive on paper, so not much risk
You make it sound like I can be the 35 year old with the early retirement with corn though, and with gold I can take it to my grave. I'm just laughing here because that's more or less what I'm reading
it's more of a math thing than a reading thing, but you do what you feel. gold = you have something. corn = either you have nothing or you have a lot.

btw you're not first in line to retire off of corn.

also look at my username. I'm not anti-corn at all. I've done a lot of corn. I think there's a lot of potential in the corn-space. There's also a lot of risk, especially for technologies that aren't improving.
Ah yeah I never could argue with the math. I tried though!
BNTX target price raised to 360. That shit is trading in the 220s lol

Stock up from $230 to opening around $300 after blowout earnings.  Pretty much going to open above entirety of past 6 months.

It’s definitely not a bubble.
Go long on traditional auto leaps. Tesla, Lucid, Nikola, whatever other bullshit is going to get scalped when electric Hummers and F150s and whatnot are available. Rivian should be okay because of big daddy Bezos and Ford money.

Do some research instead of asking WSB?
fed should aim for full employment instead of worrying about this inflation
They have no control over employment. There’s enough job openings already. The problem is no one wants to take jobs where it costs them more money than what they earn. The more they hold off the much more aggressive they will need to be to raise rates.
what are you talking about maximum employment is one of the fed's primary responsibilities
Lol yeah, it’s pretty much at max employment by definition if there are more jobs available than job applicants.

Damn my AFRM lotto puts up 500% from yesterday. I had written some short DD in a comment saying price was too high given Visa/MC/PayPal's sell-off and lowered future forecast. And people probably aren't paying off their loans :https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/10/30/its-not-just-affirm-sezzles-bnpl-borrowers-are-fal/
Sad af bro. I had a 128 lotto for a hundred bucks. Sold it at open for 3.30. It’s like 14.30 now….
Prog looks to rip hard in AH
My SENS bonerrrr
Me poking DIS: “Do something”
Where's the fuckee who told me uranium had a breakout
He didn’t tell you it was priced in
the breakout was months ago
Goddam it push this bitch green already
Candles on PFE still looking bullish.
Up 121% on my WISH lotto tix. Sell before EOD or diamond hand into oblivion?
sell the amount you put in

that way you'll be satisfied either way you go
STRN IS NEXT SOPA yeee to the moon 💪🏼
Uh drill team 6? Yeah they are crawling out of the hole again. Yeah go ahead and shove em back in where they belong.
Anyone here actually know when RIOT Q3 earnings are?
Everywhere I look I keep seeing the days change. Who TF knows 😩
It’s insane
Ipo everywhere
Wow U with the huge recovery from yesterday
I just had to give away some profit for chasing SOPA like a little slut… smfh
What's going on Russell, u ok?
SPCE trying to break out
Come on let's go!

Release the hounds!

I wanna see what this Rivian thing does already!
Hopefully tsla doesn’t tank when rivian ipos
Probably do the opposite
OK, I bought some WISH calls. You guys might want to buy some puts because all my earning plays have gone the other way. 100% record.
Going to save my account with 100 11/15 affirm puts
Now I know my calls will print for sure
Now I know my puts will print for sure 🔄

AFRM🚀
Down 37,000 for the whole year.
Nice now you can write off $3k/year for 12 years. Make sure to pay taxes on your unrealized gains next year tho.
You can do better
Right? He's down 37k for the year *so far*
Thanks for making me feel better
rational, orderly markets.
Might have to triple down on NVDA
Nvda loves $300
Huge GENI bull. Today is a sad day for me
More NVDA more!!!
Drill team 6 is working hard
analysts raise nvda price targets to 350+… proceeds to drop under 300. WORD
It is up like $50 in a week. Stocks need pullbacks. It's a basic part of the market.
7% pullback not enough need 16% like tesla? only stock i’ve seen where PT news moves stock price lower lmao
Look at the yearly chart. Semis are way overbought. Wait til RSI comes back down and then they will probably get going again.

Though earnings next week muffs that up and it might break back out.
good perspective
How ON PLANET EARTH is UCO under 100?
alright unity is in a huge bubble again

i swear investors just forget they don’t make money
aight selling my $160 call then
[deleted]
470 above
not puts . . . trust me
I was 100% convinced on dash puts and loaded up on Sofi calls just now so everyone should probably do puts

Get used to it. Another week of it, at least
Inflation, I never heard of it
BABA about to breakout the 3 month high?
if u buy a weekly today, it should be required that it says 

“tomorrow is a holiday”

cause i’m a dumbass and forgot
but the market is open tomorrow
Tomorrow is a holiday? Fuck me

Edit: market isn’t closed
i just checked

veterans day is a federal holiday, and the bond markets will be closed….

BUT STOCKS ARE OPEN BABY LETS GOOO
"The darkest hour is just before dawn." Warren Buffet
Sometimes I hit a good play and I’m like “damn I’m nice” then I buy 210 SNDL 1c for fun because it’s $420 and then reality sets in
me buying 100 DAL 45c weeklies when it was trading down to 39 in July LMFAO
You have to be fucking kidding me spy. Wtf is you problem
It’s all manipulated. Sideways until the motherfucking crooked ass pigs decide they’ve loaded up. Then it’ll rocket.

They’re just killing everyone’s options right now. Fucking assholes.
$sens is always the play
hit big with spy calls last week. took gains and pretty much gave it all back with more calls. The cycle continues
Haven't got anything to say but fuck theta gang
Lockup on TOST ends tomorrow morning, 10 million shares can be sold. Soooooo $50 puts
Bond yields sideways. CPI sideways. Rate hikes sideways. Dead cat bounces sideways. 10-yr sideways. Futures sideways. SPY sideways. Market sidew
Your mom is sideways so I can pound her gaping hole easier
Bro she has 7 children so her putting out is nothing new
Niiiice
I really want to tell my fam about stonks and fake internet coins but i dont want them to lose everything and blame me.
Not worth it to tell them
UVXY limp af even when the market now clearly in the red
Look I get it stocks only go up.


But what the ever flying fuck.
I’m probably late on this, but how are the palantards feeling? Buying opportunity?
Sofi dipping before earnings is giving me hope that it’ll pump if they are decent.  Its the hope that kills us
Same
I’m scared bc of what happened to UPST! But I hope it’s a different situation
Upstart is also up 670% YTD. Sofi has not had a similar run.
What's rivians moat?
Pickup trucks, smh
What happened to AFRM
U at 190 today would be glorious
Idk why I haven’t been buying calls on that for months now. Hit it big once when it ran from 100 to 120 look at it now
Fiverr and BABA saved my day
Fiverr murdered me
SENS save my life today...
Is rivian trading at noon?
Uranium been popping these days
should i hop on AMD during this dip? i have no shares
Might be more dip left in this
Every AMD pop sells of in what .02 seconds ?
My disappointment and frustration is immeasurable

Think I got an addiction

Why did I do this? https://imgur.com/BXNrd9j
Damn, I need your ToS spy drawing. Looks so much better than my ratchet ass crayons.
Dude chill.
I agree about the addiction, this isn’t normal. Your account keeps going down and you keep adding to losing positions
Nah if you look at the screenshot I am not loosing money
What happened to the $2900 and the 475 calls?
Rolled them over to 485
You know to make money on those calls spy has to be well over 485? That’s still like 5% in 9 days just to hit 485 and expire worthless
What are the bets here on SOFI? I might try doing the inverse of the majority LOL
Don't tell them your plans!  They will inverse themselves knowing you will inverse them and you'll be fucked
Up
Most posts the past 2 days have been super pessimistic. Seems most people think it will go the way of UPST. I'm holding onto my 20c position through at least the next few weeks.
I could see it going down 4%
I sweat to fucking god NVDA if you dont get your act together I will fucking sell you for MSFT leaps.
How much do you want these companies to pump ? Nvda still a good long term play but it’s not going to rocket anytime soon.
I don’t think you understand how valuable these companies are to the future my dude. 

Let me say this- if China hit Taiwan and took over TSMC? 

We’d be fucked. Absolutely fucked. We wouldn’t even need to go to war. It would be lost right there and then. 

The future is in computing. Everything is a fucking computer. Your refrigerator is a fucking computer. Do you think that trend is going to stop? Slow down? Nah man. It’s just speeding up now.
Does the whole evergrande about to default bug you out for NVDA?
No because Washington has its eyes on Taiwan. They know how much we need it. They’ll protect it.
When do your calls expire?
Not until December, and one in 2023.
Ya I own a lot of TSM. I get it. 

I just think NVDA was massively pumped and won’t explode again for awhile. Not saying it’s a bad investment , but people gotta have patience with it.
That’s true but I thought that exact same thing 1 year ago. When it was 1/2 the price. I said it with the same conviction you have now saying it to me. 

Then I realized this is the next trillion dollar company in 1 year or less.
You forget about earnings lol?
Banks looking mighty attractive with all this rate talk

Coin gonna die 🥲🤡
Western Union and AT&T bothe moving out from demand zones very nice moves

Dude the IV on WISH FD's is getting ridiculous
Time to start selling puts 💵
The IV  on those puts are over 450% right now
Yeah, it's like free money.
Stocks are down and puts a down. I'm feeling down
What’s the consensus on SoFi? Thinking of buying some stock for first time but dont want to miss an even bigger dip this afternoon.
Earnings could be a count flip. Up 80 AH, down 2 AH. Whooooo knows *ominous voice*
Blesss $SMURF/$COIN up 26% while everything tank this stock just keep going up
If roblox can go sub $90 by today or tomorrow. I’ll be a happy camper
Sub 83 by Friday would make me happy.
We’re almost there
Fuck me right in the ZIM
anyone in SENS?
$DIDI ripping. CCP gone let it’s app back on to be downloaded. LFGO !
EVGO started pumping after good earnings today, but next week when Biden signs infra bill, EVGO will reallyyy fkn pump
That makes zero sense. Literal definition of priced in
Gonna get burned on pypl I feel it in my loins
I probably will short term too but my calls are long dated. What's your date and strike?
> I have a date of July 1st, 2018 and my strike is $1.5k
Very cool visualmod! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I have 1/2023 270s and 300s but I bought them last week so down like 30% on them
That is rough but that's so long dated I'm sure you'll be fine
yeah hope so lol what do you have?
3/18/22 195c they are pretty expensive but delta is high and I really don't think it will drop much below $200
Yeah I wouldn't worry too much about those.  I bought mine when the  stock was trading around ~228 so I've taken a hit lol
This markets sucks
how da fuck can you lose money this week
I made money but it’s just stupid.  The dollar is sky high today of all days, really?  This is basically a roulette table that pays out black when the wheel hits red
Chasing bullshit
Jpow just forgot to change the cartridges this week  guys right?
Is $12 the new $10 for TLRY?
Sure seems like it. More interesting movement now though
I WILL SAY THIS AGAIN, BUY FIGS. Earnings is AH today and it’s gonna POP. I got a ban bet going for $50
Fresh or dry figs?
Figs scrubs brother
Apparently their PE is 2752
DIDI having a sudden boner
Every time that thing hits $8 it bounces.
I’m pretty bullish in general, but if your not at least hedging with some spy puts your a special type of retard
Wtf is nvda doing
Is that guy who tried to play the Viacom rebound with like hundreds of thousands of dollars in $50 LEAPS still around? Cause that’s gotta suck.
Someone find a cure for cancer or something?
literally making money off the IV increase on both calls/puts on SOFI rn
Hoping it’s good. For my calls sake
Tmrw AMD pumping back up you can see hedges are set
150c 11/19 will print
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/A_Fucking_Circle (1/1) made a bet that DASH would go to 180.0 when it was 188.7 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
RIOT is countering the damage PLTR is doing to my account
If JPow gets replaced, can't he work as a Fed gov somewhere? His expertise shouldn't go to waste.
Why would he want that? He can be a professor somewhere and make loads of money consulting, giving speeches and writing a memoir
I don't know. Serve the country lol. Not abandon his autistic children on this sub.
$DIS thoughts anyone? thinkin earnings play is to sell calls.
160p x10 we shall seeeeeeee
everyones talking up disney plus but its not that great
ah yes the classic falling off a cliff then all the sudden ten dollar candle pump by tesla
OK CHGG lets see you pop unusually high volume on the upside today maybe its time for a breakout back to the $40s lets go !
Amazon you bitch go back up
bought puts on the chef that's tattooed. +20% AH guaranteed
Getting in desperate need of an AMD or NVDA pop like soon
I’m convinced I’m going to down 99% before it starts moving again
Getting ready to load FB calls again today at EOD I think. Some 350s expiring in 2/3 weeks feel safe
Nothing is safe right now.
I suppose you're right. Market feels a lil toppy but only play that looks oversold in tech rn
2-3 weeks, safe, yeah you belong here
Another dive
Nice weed stocks to look into other than TLRY ?

Ford coming out with an EV drill
No shit. How are they hitting the jackpot today and still falling hard af
Everyone's pulling from F and going into Rivian thinking they are going to get rich. When rivian opens put calls on F during the dip. When they realize it's a sham they all come back to F ride that bull like you stole it!
atleast that's my game plan!
Some whale really wants TSLA below 1000 cause they missed out last time
Of all things to pick today WHY DID I TOUCH AMD
You missed the peak, but it's still good stock.
Anyone playing Disney earnings?

Shares? Calls? Strike date? 

Just picked up 8x 190c 11/19 and 2x 180c 11/19 

Went close to the money with RBLX so I want to have more leverage if they beat and raise guidance. Seems to me like high vax+Pfizer antiviral should bolster outlook
[deleted]
Haha I’ve been burned so often on DASH I know market money loves it. Was warning people off it yesterday because they always parlay some stupid bullshit (Finland? Really?) into a new shiny reason why the fact that they’re losing money doesn’t matter.

I’m in for what I am willing to lose. Will probably pick up a put or two before close for a little downside protection. 

Good luck to us 🤝
I think China wrapping up DIDI's investigation hence markets betting. Not sure if its big money.
Sofi earnings, which way 🤔?
No upside unless they announce bank charter, which I doubt
EXFY ipo on going ?
[deleted]
Good call I think.  That stuff did not really catch on
If UPST declined after earnings due to a typo in their Ebitda and the actual number was higher, doesn’t that mean UPST is undervalued at the moment?
Buying THE FUCK out of this spy dip 467 exp Friday
Ah shit, down we go.
Dam dat ten year rise today smackin' tech bulls' arses
Someone just sell me a $BBBY Jan 2022 call for $4.20 already
Red everywhere, meanwhile Avis just plugging along at $260 up 4% today. Maybe they have a deal with Rivian no one knows about
The one thing I want to go down
Who got RBLX puts?
Meeeee
So is Rivian ever going to open? Maybe they should try again tomorrow.
Damn stocks volatile.
I have a union job ya boy is recession proof
Not inflation proof tho. Your rate is locked in.
No lol I have a salary and I get raises my G

Nothing is overvalued in this market.

You realize price doesn’t mean everything right? Lol they could just not have a lot of shares.  That said, the mkt cap is ridiculous

OK THATS NOT NORMAL
Is it bad I still lik the stonk
Alright so the second I buy puts it'll reverse right?
SPY is breaking support at 465. Rip weeklies
Made $300 on SQQQ.   But losing 2K on QQQ call.

It still feel like winning for me.

Which way will SOFI go after the ER?

Idk I got more puts than calls on it but, I always fuck up earnings.

COIN vibes. Smaller EV also in shambles, they thought it would help them instead of stealing market share
The banks and the wealthy really appreciate you guys buying their shit for 50 percent more then they paid in no time at all. Fuck it must be so easy to have money and fleece this market
And Rivian was locked at $78 while the bankers opened at $114.  Slow bleed off now …
Buying some more IONQ
Yeah why have they fallen 20%
It's gotta be some lock up ending or something

Reading those filings is such a pain in the ass it's all if this trades above X amount for 10 of 20 days preceding blah blah then we vest 69% blah blah
What’s the appeal with rivian? Ford has them beat in pretty much every metric with the lightning.

i dont wannaknow what it would taketo make it. go up 10%
Ever choose to try to sell what looks like a completely dead call to close it out, sitting at .01, bid it at .05, have it bought instantaneously and then think, hmmmm…. Did I just make a mistake?
Always. Sold like 3 of those this morning. Just waiting for the imminent bull run on them
Damn my HUT calls are down 80% today. I thought they mined money wtf

Like me, the market has slipped into a depression
Glad I just bought an AR for when the world goes to shit due to rampant inflation.  Calls on Smith & Wesson

Can I get a quick roll call of rivian losses so far
Don't look at me, I got in at 78 and sold at 112.
At what point do I sell my ford calls down 25 and 35%
SOFI earnings play 🤔 ?
Probably no charter.

And misses out on earnings because of more IPO related employee stock comp exp

Dead cat bounce. Afternoon dump still scheduled like each day this week.

Alright who’s paperhanding
Guys hold on, i am gonna change pants cause i just shit on it.
sector rotation into $ROPE
Sold my SOXL puts yesterday. If I had just held on would have made $9.5k more! Shit shit 😥😥😥 why did I paperhand them!????????
Notning like selling my 11/10 SPY 364p for a loss and it goes ITM with less than 2 hours in the trading day 🤣
Retards getting rug pulled today.
NVDA 323.10 to 294.80 and falling in just over 24 hours. Tech is totally collapsing!
Nah. 315 next week
So glad I wrote covered calls on sofi
If earnings go good that might not work out
Odds of it breaking $25 are slim but not 0
True
Shake shake, shake it off
Buy more spy 500 for Jan you fucking retard bulls
I had money, now I have a lot less, I thought I would be rich too🥲
Hmmm, que pasa?
The fact TSLA is still up 2.4% on a day like this, is straight tomfoolery. Algos see a moving average and just full stop 🤦🏻‍♂️ we got a ways to go on the indexes still

If you buy right now you’re almost certain to lose money.
Throw it into FCEL leaps. Infrastructure bill + carbon tax will bring lots of new orders for FCEL. Industry is going to need alternative energy.

Edit: Any other alternative energy infrastructure provider will do as well.

Burn it down
This is going back Atleast 5% more
the dip that keeps on dipping
fuck. I think even though it looks like there is support this bad boy is about to shit itself in the next 30. I regret buying calls. Im a bear. I dunno what I was thinking.
People really don’t know the difference between lose and loose 🤯
fake investors lose money

real investers loose money
Guess they have nothing too loose 🤷‍♂️

Is it a good idea to buy UPST? Is this the dip and it will go back up?
Bought 20 $spy 580c for 2024 to set and forget.
Get ATM calls 4-6 weeks out. 

👍
Realizing you don’t want to lose money is the first step right?
Have no idea why some banks have such strength right now
Banks love rate hikes, they make more money
Interest rates are on the rise globally. Fed is going to start hiking soon. Who makes money when rates go up? Banks. Their core business always does well in a high interest rate environment, because the spread between what they collect on loans and what they pay to depositors widens when rates are high.
The dollar was actually confirmed strong today surprisingly enough, it’s way up.  Inflation should have been more like 15% but it’s only 6.2%, the other world currencies we are compared to are in shambles in comparison.  Imagine not being the reserve currency as oil and food prices go out of control
Interest rates going up means banks make more money
I want to uninstall Investing.com app so I can stop getting these fucking notifications about companies being down 5 percent
Just disable notifications??
How many days of red from this cpi number?
may be just 2. we will be back to bull mode next week

ya going to $30 tomorrow

Everything rally starts soon 🚀
How does one sue the market for pain and suffering
If amd hits 145 tomorrow at open I will stop options
Set a stop loss in case it keeps tanking. Hoping to break even is a great way to go from -35% to -95%
My ford calls are 12/17. So theta is on my side. Holding.
12/3 calls <3
Mine are 11/12 so nothing is on my side
I've got 11/19 but they're $20cs so I just need a little bump over the week to save my ass
I have some bad news. If you're holding calls theta is not on your side
Should I sell twilio for more SOFI?

I think Z has more downside still
Most of my calls expire like 11/26 and I have a little hope left but this sucks man

Just passed my part 107 sUAS exam 🎉 but I’ve come back to a shitty portfolio smh..
How hard was it?
Bro… so much shit to memorize that you and I probably won’t ever utilize lol.. but really man if you have a good understanding how to read the supplement charts and a TAF/METAR, it’s really a lot of common sense with a few tricky questions here and there. I can send some videos I watched if you want man! Got a 90%
Hell yeah. Thinking about getting it to do real estate photography as a side job.
Very nice that’s exactly why I got it too man. I wholesale properties and have been using it for a quick quote on a roof replacement or to assess different parts of the property etc. but I figured this will be great to use for advertising on the real estate apps for end-buyers. But I peeped indeed too and they got like $30-$50/hr small jobs all over the place.

Market volatility doesn’t need a reason. Number goes up, comes down a bit, goes up again later. Just the way it is.
ofc $RIOT dips after I get into a large position..guh
I got into corn mining stocks yesterday right before the big dip, too, lol.  Oh well, I’m pretty sure they should run up next month as corn nears the blow off top phase.
Yeahhh…guess we got to sweat a bit for it.

What the fuck is the reason for this market slip?
Honestly no idea, when the inflation data came out the market seemed fine.
Inflation is apart of the economy though. I understand no one liking hyper inflation, but if it’s just inflation, then what the hell
Im confused too. Inflation is technically bullish.
There is no 'reason' here
So people are just “taking their ball and going home”?

Lol Rivian is worth more than Ford wat
Anyone have an opinions on BYND earnings? Retarded or otherwise I am all ears. I only wish to inverse you.
There are few things I like more than a raging SPY power hour
Stocks are dead. Everybody buy bonds.
Imagine parking your money in Nokia
Lol you would probably get a better return with an Ally savings account
Holy crap BB u workn' with AMZN to get a Shrek dildo?

Must be some good news coming perhaps Jpow renomination Spy big $2 bounce
where are people seeing that Musky started selling? did he tweet or something?
Tesla volume was double the average yesterday. He probably sold most of his shares then.
He has until Aug 2022

&#x200B;

I dont know if he actually sold yet tho
How fucked are my BYND puts?
I picked outs also. Goddamn it
Went the whole day without checking my account. Not sure if dumb or smart
I bought a UVXY hedge that’s why we’re bouncing
Really debating if I sell my AFRM calls before close or just man up and hold to 0
I mean can it fall anymore lol?
I mean the ER is after hours... so yes
Def hold till earnings sir
Maybe we're just trying too hard, when really it's closer than it is too far
Thanks to some very clever financial footwork, I find myself broke.

look at last sofi earnings. it was a bloodbath. any reason why this one would be different?
because previous events doesn't effect future shit
MM algos just fleecing us for the tendies we smurfed last few weeks on megacaps. Has to be done really or they can't fucking make the markets. Informational disadvantage and all that.
How long will it be until you see a Rivian on the road?
Trick question: you will not
1 year
Price point and production, so like 3-5 years
They’ve delivered what? A couple hundred so far? It’s going to be awhile
My uncle saw one in Manhattan 2 weeks ago.
When you live in your parents basement, probably a while.
Weeeeee 🌈perma bear is back to wsb threads.
Sold my AFRM puts. I think the stock will go down after earnings today but didn't want to lose my 430% profit.
Definitely a good idea, that iv crush would have gotten you so bad
But some puts back before close. House monry
DASH holding $215 strong 😂 fuck this stock, it needs SNAP and PTON treatment
If tsla doesn’t breach 160 here it will end red for the day

/u/spyaintnobitch (0/1 trillion)  bought retarded SPY calls and got fukt, so they were deemed retarded for life.
Sour hour confirmed
TSLA decoupling from SPY
Someone tell me why CLOV is going DOWN after good earnings?
3 leaves instead of 4
Clov will skyrocket when universal healthcare is passed. Biden hasnt mentioned uni health once
Because it is insurance company not a tech company and they trade at cheap p/e and in case of clov it cannot even make $$.
The market is up side down
Some good buys today. Lol

Lol wish down 10% today and my calls bought at open up $200 on IV alone.
If ford rallies tomorow I’ll be solid. If not. Oh well
Might blow a load right in my pants
DKNG keeps widening my asshole. Every fucking day 😤
What a treat
WISH way will we go on earnings tonight!
Lost $650 on TSLA puts today
Shoula bought em last week and sold them yesterday like me 😜🤑
Lmao UPST is basically a lending platform and it is trading close to 200+ PE it has grow something as big as Visa to justify its valuation…
Not holding any puts, may Zeus protect me overnight ⚡
CNBC has been sucking SOFI’s dick all day. This makes me very nervous going into earnings today.

Get outta my face commie 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
If you look at the details of the CPi, it didn't even come close to matching public rent or car data for the month, yet still rose almost 1%

7% in Nov seems very likely
Sure. market is just gonna ignore the inflation. Ponzi must go on
Inflation is the market
Well inflation is bad for consumers but not necessarily businesses. 

Still. Wait 18 minutes. It’ll drop.
SPY with the huge green erection
RIVN implied open $375…F TO $30
show your work
CPI at 6.2% which means real inflation is about 350% give or take and our retarded financial media is acting surprised by this. Meanwhile the brain trust at the Fed is still buying MBS while people wash trade jpegs for an honest living. 

Just let the fucking stonk market reprice so people under 50 can get a piece of the action you fucks. Instead, they nurture this clown economy that will take an absolute SHIT on the next two generations. 

TSLA 1500c weeklies
It doesn’t take an econ major to realise when companies start paying their employees more the companies will push that loss onto their customers. McDonald’s raised pay anywhere from 10-15% and food prices went up 6%.
Cant wait for that CPI @ 10% in January/Feb lol.

Friendly reminder that WISH is going to zero
Rivian is the biggest ipo since 2014. 

Let that sink in. The market will be fucked today. You cannot predict it today. 

That is all.
Hasn’t even IPO’d yet and you’re already hyping up your bags
No bags I don’t play IPO’s but it’s tanking the rest of the market.
Tesla bagholders have been given a chance to sell above $1k

Whatever you think will happen with TSLA usually DOESNT happen with TSLA.

Gme plus LOOPRING!!!
Treasury yields down yesterday. Numbers will be shit. Big fat green today.
They are down but people are scooping up treasuries left and right even though it currently means they loose cash to inflation.  I suspect some funds are preparing for an early rate hike.
Yields been tanking. Still red.
10y were up 5 bp Monday. Back to Friday levels yesterday.
Big green tomorrow
F, F, F - RIVN today!
Buy the rumor, sell the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

Fucking spent all my money on snap and square calls
i only have 2 :) 20 bucks for now is 80. start trading option to scary go yolo yet.
My yolo money comes from spy plays.

It usually gives back about 50-200%, I take out my principle, reinvest then gamble the profits lol, so far I’ve been wrong almost every time
Last friday i brought spy 500 for dec 31. Spy veen downwards since last friday : )
That was you??? Fucking knew it, jk, I think it’ll rebound at the end of the week, I have some calls expiring, might end up being worthless though

TSLA waiting for $900 entry.  LCID did well for me.

There just aren’t enough EV’s for the market need, and buyers don’t want a legacy automaker they want fresh and innovative.
Yeah, obviously just a matter of taste. LCID definitely been a good play. Good luck on  RIvian, I’m going to wait for it to settle in before I make a play.

This your first time?
no, but if you follow that strategy, it could be your last time.
Bye bye spy
this is what everyone is planning for, so I'm guessing we'll see green dildos.
Narrator: “they did not see green dildos”

🤣🤣🤣
Hold NVDA 3/22 300c or abandon ship?

It’s tempting. But I’m passing. I already said I’m not playing today. But boyyyyyyyyyy is it tough not too
I keep looking at FB though, if I can buy myself enough time, I’ll do it.  Maybe.
So is TSLA dead cat bouncing or actually mooning?

Raise the rates you cowards
They’d be raising interest rates on our massive debts you know.  I don’t think they have the balls.  We can’t afford the interest now.  The impacts would be brutal near term.
This is what most people are missing. The fed wants high inflation to counter the massive debt from the pandemic.

the virgin wsb gambler hodls like a bitch and gets reemed by thetagang.
I set my short calls at $30 but my short puts at $23 means I get my asshole tickled every few months

I think I'm fine though. Rolled most of them and I have until 11/19 to recover on the rest

Anyone picked up some TSLA at $1k?

☺️
I was scared, considering Musk hasn't sold yet
Zero worries here. It’s a dip. Good price point.

For me, EV is about manufacturing. How you do it?
I'm not brave enough to time the market. I just hold on. Maybe sell in 2025.
Well if you’re holding, it’s a different deal. I had none up until now.
Nice, welcome to the club! 2022 gonna be even better. Q4 is looking pretty excellent right now too. 70,000 run rate for October out of Giga Shanghai.
Thanks. Made OK money last year with it. This year, I held back based on some assumptions. 

TSLA is always solid…just the entry time is tricky now.
After peaking ATH? No way.
Yeah, this morning. The low was $987. 

You set the order limit and you go to bed.
Wish a niqqa would
Well SOFI, I choose to ride through with you on earnings. Take me to the promised land
Same!
You going for calls or have shares?
Short puts
What strike did you sell? I rolled my short calls down and closer to $19.5 because I don’t want to lose my shirt
35 strike, 2024. Sold them in September when SOFI bottomed.
Lmao why didn’t you just buy the stock? Is this a margin thing? 

There’s hardly any extrinsic value now and probably much less when you sold them.
Bc the stock needs to move up for me to make money. With short puts it doesn't. And um, that's the point of these ITM puts. I want them to be worth less than what I sold them for so I can buy them back and pocket the difference. Do you know how short puts work? Lol
I do but the advantage of selling puts over buying the stock is the extrinsic value that you can make. It’s true that if SOFi is flat you make something, but the fact there’s not a lot of extrinsic value and that it’s more than two years away means you will earn very little theta. 

LEAPs also have worse liquidity so depending on how your order got filled it is harder to enter and exit the trade at a good price. Also, the expiration is so far away, you actually have to consider Rho. In this case since this is a short put, you can actually make something from interest rate hikes if it happens between now and expiration, as the convenience yield of having cash goes up. 

It’s not a bad trade, it’s just something you have to weigh against other options like simply buying shares and or selling calls against them. Liquidity being one of the biggest factors on why you may choose a different strategy to go long.
It's not a theta play. If you sell something so deep in the money it means you're crazy bullish on it and expect it to move up but don't want to risk calls bc I don't want theta working against me and I'm not sure 100% the stock will rise. No matter how bullish I am I dont have a crystal bal to say definitively SOFI will rise, but it's a much safer way of being bullish. 

My order got filled fine. And the open interest has only increased as SOFI has risen. I got in at 14.50 Sofi has gone as high as 23 since. The contracts have already lost a lot of value. My break even if I got assigned shares is 13. This is a sleep well at night trade, I'm not concerned with getting rich off of this, just look at it like a CD like rate of return but in options form.
Rivian might turn to a pump n dump like your whore wife. We love a quickie bust n go
Who can dump though, besides those that purchase today
I plan to pump and dump it today, gonna double my money probably
Thoughts on getting Ford rn?

Why
Bull trap or bear trap 🧐
Bull trap, this economy is fucked
The economy doesn't know it's fucked. It's Wile E. Coyote and hasn't looked down yet.
Theta trap.
Bull.. -1% on spy
Whichever one your Wife is.
BUY THE FORD DIP!!!!!! lmaooo
Rivian has produced 65 cars. 

This IPO at $93 billion is pricing in
$1.3b per car they manufactured. 1.3 Billion. 


It manufactures 2 per day.
The banks gave it a valuation of 70B. Then they say the market is overvalued and we are in a bubble. Fkn rats
So with that data we are looking at 2x365x1.3B= $949B is what it should be valued at so shares are an easy 10 bagger at these levels by my calculations
Come on rivian you piece of shit
I don't see all that excitement that was mentioned.
#THEYRE TAKING THE HOBBITS TO EVERGRANDE
Wow rivian got to 7

It has a loooooong way to fall.

Welp, SOFI, its been fun, bye bye
Bears bragging in the comments— bottom is in
I got downvoted yesterday for saying SPY puts were my play lol
Got downvoted Monday for saying QQQ was going to start going down and again on Tuesday

Should of just went all in on 🌽. Equities are fake and gay
CORNBASE
Who else is straight up not having a good time?
okay everything is on discount ... i literally have the 5 of the worst performing stocks on my watch list of 200 stocks
SOMEONE HOLD ME IM SCAREDDDDD
going into a meeting, I expect a full recovery by the time I am out or else 😤😤😤
I AINT BUYING PUTS, CALLS ONLY BABY
Calls on VIX
I’m usually as bullish as you can get but this is not recovering this week
Anyone got any TSLA puts?
2 red days in a row means Green Day tomorrow. BTFD
this morning was green tho, until that overvalued EV stock start trading, everything went red
anddd here comes the end of the day pump. hope you didn't paper hand your calls
One last TSLA bull trap before the final descent. GG lads
Elon is taking all our money retards
A pack of shitty quality steaks at Costco is now $93.  Keep telling everyone that inflation is transitory or that inflation isn't hurting consumers that much.  The loss of dollars from my wallet sure as shit isn't transitory.
How many steaks are in a pack
nobodys forcing you to consume red meat
Yea eat cat food like the rest of us
Tomorrow we’re gonna be up bigly. Nobody cares about inflation anymore.
TSLA with the most retarded moves today. A stock of the people. One of us. One of us.
The confidence in here is how you know the sell-off isn't finished
By that logic, the sky is falling bs flying in here an hour ago is how you know the bottom is in.
the local bottom, on a 1-day scale, sure... not, say, a 3-month scale.
Fords gotta rebound tomorrow… right?
Considering it's made a ton off it's 12% stake in rivian, probably
Why?
Hope so I just bought a bunch of calls
We think Sofi will drop even more after earnings?
My puts hope so
100 put $22 strike
Fuck if TSLA drops under 1000 it’s going down big time ain’t it?
If tesla drops below 900 I'm selling put credit spreads. You see the premiums?
It dropped 130 yesterday. 20 last night.  It’s already gone down big time.
Nah it’s going to bounce
It’s falling from technicals. And falling because there needed to be a cash grab for Rivian IPO
> A Tesla Model S is a fully electric four-door, five-passenger premium sedan manufactured and sold by American automaker Tesla Motors. The EPA official range for the 2012 Model S Performance model equipped with an 85 kWh battery pack is 265 miles (426 km), higher than any other production automobile at the time.[5]
what would we do without you
Yellen seems like a major cunt
I just want 2 more red days of TSLA to wipeout the call holders who keep trying to catch a falling knife and halve the daily users.
I love seeing the comment history of loss porn posters. Usually full of "you hate money if you don't buy Tesla calls"
kind of a weird thing to want, you okay bud?
Feeling pretty great:)

Are you okay? Really hope you didn't pull the trigger on those TSLA 1300 calls you were talking about
reading through your comments and bro you sound like a miserable human being lol honestly if you need someone to talk to hit me up I dont mind listening
Now that you ask, I would really love it if you'd post your loss porn this morning.
Is it? Loss porn is the heartsblood of this sub

Why the fuck are people selling when inflation is so goddamn high. Fucking idiots. Cash is getting less and less valuable
value stocks > growth
Clearly value stocks are going up..
You don't get it do you? People are rotating. Risk on.

Whats he waiting for?  
Sell the stocks you fucking worthless coward.
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule-10b5-1.asp
whats he afraid of, some accusations?  
smells like a coward, sounds like a coward, and looks like a coward.
Sold SoFi and staying cash for the rest of the week. Something seems wonky this week and it's all a little to finicky to predict.
you read my mind. i like sofi and was gonna step in, but i think i’m gonna wait till after earnings to see. too many companies going down after good earnings imo
SoFi +40% AH confirmed. Thanks for the heads up!
this week has been super fucky. I have been cash gang since Friday. Not seeing anything to buy currently
What makes you guys think something is off specifically this week
If Rivian is $100B, NIO should be a $500B company lmao 

What a joke
Poor ford lmao. Rivian valued higher than them before ever producing a commercial vehicle, including fords 5% stake in rivian.
Try 12%
Lol even more ridiculous
Imagine still having 95% of your portfolio in GME.
Dumber things have been done. Like buying rivian over $100
still waiting for the “real squeeze”
Same
Right, 100% is where it’s at.
Been my best performing stock. I don’t see a problem with it. I like making money
not selling my QQQ puts fuckyou bulls
Don't cry tomorrow.

Rivian will cause so many tears here 🥲
Folks tend to inverse the advice here 🤔
Ford F-150 is the best selling truck in the country. It will be the best selling EV truck in the country as well
Reason why I'm holding it til next year. $30+ by the end of this year or January easy
So many F LEAPs
Id cop it
It’s the most widely sold automobile in the world. For a long time.
There are some cool mods on the wsb mod team, but I can't lie, sometimes it's hard not to get a lil butthurt when they do shit like enforce the rules

NVDA STOCK FUCKIN CHEAP
Tesla to 600 fair price
220 and it would maybe fit the most ridiculous valuations of decent companies right now
420.69 was the fair price pre-split

Thank you RIVN and F
Inflation highest since 1990 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Aye. Forreal? I literally sent out a report yesterday saying its highest since 2000s. I'm in the meeting now where I need to talk about it. Thanks for the heads up.
1990 is the headline on CNBC so I would definitely toss that year out
Green by open is no joke
Kinda is
And yet I'm laughing.
why is TSLA up today?

well, it was down 10% yesterday so you'd have to be insane to buy puts on a -10% day, the fed is also printing 120 bil a month too to keep tech pumped

calls are much safer than puts here
The ancient one has spoken
[deleted]
dont bet against the printer

jpow gives no fuks
It hit weekly support. This is a dead cat bounce.
i am talking longer than a week, we still have over 6 months of QE left which is really good for TSLA over that period of time

you can definitely win on puts here but if you are looking at it for a longer period, calls are better IMO
Bought QQQ puts near close on a big red day and sold this morning for easy 20%

Could have done the same with Tesla this morning.
thats the way to do it with puts these days, if you are in the green you gotta unload them before jpow runs you over

selling at open was a very smart move on your part
Are you actually the oldest acc here
Massive inflation numbers and markets go up. Unreal
You're still my hero
Shit's rigged
They dipped big yesterday and AH. 

They knew what the numbers would be then
Clown world
Markets are down, retard
Dead cat bounce for many
Henry Ford just sold 10% of his stock
i heard there was a twitter poll
Ford about to pick up $1.40 a share in value from the Rivian IPO and it's fucking drilling anyway lmfao
4 Million sale off at around noon, to lower the price to buy back in after lunch.
I am diamond handing.
Win, Lose or Draw I am out on 12/31.  Good Luck!
Down 1% after a 25% runup the last few weeks is drilling?
> Drill is a term used in the oil and gas industry to describe a well that has been drilled but not completed. A drilling rig can be moved from one location to another, so it is also known as a "mobile" or "floating" platform. The world's largest floating structure by mass production capacity is currently the semi-submersible offshore drilling facility Pioneering Spirit of Shell Oil Company with an installed deck area of 28000 square meters (about 30100 square yards).
Down 1.5% in a day when every other auto maker is up and it's going to pick up $8 to $10 billion in Rivian stock in a few hours is drilling.
GM is up like 2% the last month, Ford is up 30%. I think you're being dramatic fella. I've got Ford calls and I'm not panicking.
I have them too, and the news that Rivian was going to open way higher than the IPO price should have driven it up, not down. I can't find any catalyst for the sell off. Why anyone would decide today was the time to take profit escapes me.
Agreed, it makes no sense.
Buy LEAPS bitch
Already hold $20 2023 and $30 2023 bitch.
So why worried?
I just want my weeklies to print too.
Crazy Tesla bounce when is news gonna break that Elon sold
Open at 460 I dare you bitch

TSLA FV last week was $2500

TSLA FV this week is $500.
It just got another upgrade you clown
I’m starting to get the feeling these PTs are after they closed their positions, let it tank, and then buy back in. Assholes.
100 percent true 🤣
Oh my an upgrade. That’ll stop the price from nose diving just like those 1800 PT stopped yesterday.
Not for FDs, but leaps will print hard
Maybe. But I think if you wait you’ll get a chance in the 900s at least to go long. Bottom fishing is dangerous.
At this rate I'm never going to make 20k by the end of the year. 😔

And now that the world is on fire and the barbarians are at the gate you have the audacity to come to me in your Rivian truck and ask me to give you a jump from my (personally autographed by Elon "Lorde Edge" Musk) 4680 tabless battery, solid chrome Cybertruck?
The Nikola truck looks better than the Tesla Truck and it doesn’t even exist
Hard disagree.  The cyber truck is wild and I want one when it comes off the line.  To each their own though.

Utterly full of shit

CNBC is a 24/7 boomer infomercial.
Because there are 10k guys like that, they just find the ones that agree with them
I don't get the hype around Rivian don't they only produce like 6 cars a day
Highly anticipated new EV company backed by Amazon and Ford and a large fan base. Why would anyone buy GME in 2019-2021 when games go digital and you can get a console on Amazon or at BestBuy or Costco? It's the fandom. 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍
It’s the electric car bubble, it’s an ipo ofc it’s going up
I think people want it to compete with Tesla
Oh what's this?

A temporary moment in time where over-priced hype speculative bubble-garbage is getting hit the hardest?

I never thought I'd see the half-hour!
The sub is lacking the “gay bears get fucked” and “stocks only go up” comments today for some weird reason. Now all I’m seeing is permabulls crying pathetically some even begging for Mango Mussolini to come back to power to save their calls.

What the fuck is happening with that Loop ring shit? Some sort of GME partnership? 7X in a week - what.
yeah, there was so leaked news related with gme and loopring. did not follow that so cant tell much.
Market cap still low.  Not reached mainstream social media attention.
Apparently some code was leaked that showed loopring and a GameStop sandbox, the code could be fake but the domain names created do belong to GameStop.
DASH and UBER and the like are treated like software businesses because they have apps and are new-ish

  
They are very much physical, people-oriented businesses that lose money on all their transactions because they do not in any way scale like software businesses.  That's why they fight labor laws so hard.

  
If they grow, it's bearish.
They are so parasitic and rely on low pay and people using their own vehicles. I’m not bullish on them long term  as people can’t survive on these wages without a 2nd job
uber's geolocation tech + fleet management was pretty impressive though you gotta admit. 

You have a bit of a lazy take, akin to 'FB/GOOG are just ad companies! hur dur'
most companies have some type of proprietary technology or IP.  not just "tech" companies.  but if that underlying tech is through an app, the valuation is far different and losing money forever is OK

Nvda down 3% already yeah makes fucking sense
Stock goes up 60% in one month with no news, that makes sense to you, but down 3% makes no sense? Wtf.
It actually does make sense considering how much it went up lately. Of course there will be a correction
Blame robinhood & MM.

Systems operational my ass
I'm so fucked. Stocks down so bad. God I can't handle this pressure.
Just numbers on a screen. You never planned on cashing out anyways, not that you could
The market’s down a quarter of a percent, champ.
The market. Not my portfolio lol
Fair enough- have you blown up an account yet?
No, and I'm still green on the year. But this stock seems much more stable than it's behaving and has been dropping way lower. It's the first time I've been down and felt that, despite the price action, that I'm correct. So it's stressful. lol Such a mindfuck this whole stock game is.
Hey you’ll get it- best wishes and good luck trading!
You be aight.
If it's stocks just hold out a couple weeks, year will end just fine
Over a week of straight green days and the second the market pulls back y'all are wrecked... That's nuts. Y'all trade with no protection even tho the market makes it clear what it does every now and again when there's this much back to back Super green days...
I mean there’s a reason this place isn’t called r/investing or r/stocks or something. Crack-laced calls on meme stocks bought at the top is the name of this sub’s game.

Vix calls = money machine
Not at all, they pay terribly unless you perfectly time the market drops
Just buy 2 months out when vix is at 15 ish. Iam up 60 % on them rn
Okay now I get you. Yea when it bottoms out at around 15 support it's relatively easy money; doesn't pay huge but the money is easy. Good stuff 💰
Consider Elon tweets like an ER call. Earnings have seen insane moves so far and so will Tesla stock.

Yeah they will be fine. It wasn’t bad at all. Just been on a crazy run up.
Look at 🌽, market sold on q3 numbers and q4 is obviously going to be a blowout not only for trading volume but also for new sign ups.
CPI looking rough. 0.9% so fucking insane
Keep in mind the Dems absolutely need to crush inflation soon Bc if they don’t they all lose their jobs so expect politicians to suddenly start caring a lot and lots of pressure on the fed
Dems will try to spend their way out of the problem, won't work. Pachyderms will try to cut taxes and ban Toni Morrison books from schools. It's so crazy it just might work!
They’re all going to lose their jobs anyways, haven’t done shit since beginning of the year
A .25 increase is gonna do jack shit in time for midterms
Yeah but it’s a lose lose. Carter’s Fed crushed it and it caused a recession and his re-election.

If they raise rates it will hurt the economy right before mid terms. If they don’t raise rates and inflation/supply chain doesn’t resolve soon they’ll also lose the mid terms.
tsla going under 1000

I was wondering if the MM’s pumped it earlier than usual since apes seem to have caught onto the pre earnings pump cycle.
Tsla $1000 probably caused a lot of buy limits
I want to see a SPY halt
Tripling down on AMD and NVDA. Might break my portfolio but fuck it. I’ll get LEAPS.

who bought the nvidia dip? gawdd damn
Tesla coming in with the typical, oh you jumped on puts? fuck the 🐻
Made a quick 4k on tesla. Amd anyone?
yessirrr

wow tesla all like fuck u
Imagine buying puts  🌈
FED printer was stuffed with a lot of paper just for this day.. pump it baby... a trillion would do it. US stonks deserve to go up every day forever
I'm getting banned for betting against SPY. I deserve it.
It seems you were trying to think rationally, this is not welcome at stonks market.
TSLA is up $30 in 30 minutes … if it keeps going at that rate by the end of the day it will be up …. A lot
The beatings will continue until you learn old man.
My money. Where’d it go?
Some 🌈🐻took it…
Tesla bears, the floor is 1k!!

It was stated 2 weeks ago before the huge run up. Still holding strong. When will you learn.

I think so too.

Sure is, but if you’re in options a few months out that sweet sweet IV is gonna raise profits
Rivian will go to $150 then drop back to $80
I believe it’ll go higher and hold
Then to 30
All before lunch
Sold 35% of my tsla shares when it dropped below 1k. I hate my life
U will thank yourself in 3 months
Looks like you helped triggered the run up… probably some algo out there that was set up to buy once it went under $1k. At least it wasn’t 100% and now you have cash to play this wild market.
I know lol but yeah that's the point. Saving up some cash for the dip
What’s a fair RIVN buy price?
Considering they’ve only sold about 50 cars I’d say $20, but in this market we’ll go with $200
$78 ipo price
Holy shit coin don’t stop
just when the fuck will rivian start trading
3:59:59
I’ve been waiting years to buy RIVN stock, but with all this hype, I don’t see how it does crash  after running up today.
I got some with my constipation package.
No shit. Me too. May buy a small lot today to say i bought IPO, and accumulate after it drops hard
IPOs with at least moderate hype have popped right away, then slowly bleed out. Hot potato for sure. I too want a piece but I'll give it a few days to a week. I'll probably still FOMO in and paper hand a 40% loss lol 🤷‍♂️
Let's go Tesla to 1200 by friday I need printers baby print me my ass

Spy ready to trampoline
🌈🐻 wrestler checking in. Yesterday I got hate messages for going ballz deep into TSLA calls. Haven’t gone long on $ROPE just yet.
You mean Tesla puts you retard?
Nope bought calls at close

My name is Otto and I like to get blotto

I love how they sent him back braindead, total chad move
I’m banned from day trading on Robinhood if I open another brokerage account can I say trade ?
Yes
Just remove instant deposit and go to a cash account. No PDT rules then.

Just have to wait for cash to settle after trades though. Usually that takes 1 day.
Stocks are T+2 days.

If you sell on Monday, cash won’t be settled until Wednesday.

Options are T+1.
For robinhood? I wouldn't know since I have instant deposit. 

When I trade on TDA though, if I buy a contract and sell it the same day, that cash is always available the next morning.

If I hold that contract until the next day and sell, then that cash is immediately available for another trade since the original contract settled overnight.
No, that is SEC law…

Options are T+1, so yes that would be if you sold Monday, it would settle Tuesday.

If you buy with settled money on Monday, sell it on Tuesday, you cannot buy again with that money until Wednesday because you sold on Tuesday.  T+1.

If you buy on Monday with settled funds and sell on Monday, you can buy again on Tuesday.
I'm telling you my experience. If I buy a contract and keep it overnight, in the morning I get an email from TD saying my trade went through. If I sell that contract that day, I have those funds immediately available for another trade.
I don’t care what your anecdotal experience is, I’m telling you what the SEC laws are lol.
The laws don't fucking matter if a broker gives me access to my money on the same day as I sell the contract.

This person was talking about PTD. I'm giving them information on how to best avoid it including the one drawback of a cash account being that funds are not immediately available on a day trade, but are (on TDA options trades), if sold the *following* day.

I've done it hundreds of times this year alone. It's not anecdotal because I highly doubt I'm some special case that they are allowing to have settled cash the day of selling a contract. This is only after the trade is confirmed. I just looked and trade confirmation emails on contracts come through around 4:30 am the morning after buying a contract.
The laws don’t matter?  Lol, you’re a fuckin dumbass.

When you sell, the funds are NOT settled.  Call your fuckin broker and let them explain it to your stupid ass.

If you sell, you have the money immediately, but it is NOT settled.  If you sell what you bought the next day, you committed a violation.

You’re right, you aren’t a special case, but you definitely are special.
You can buy on Monday, sell on Tuesday, and the funds are immediately available, but they are NOT settled.

Whatever you buy on Tuesday with that money, you have to hold for a minimum of 2 trading days, or you just committed a good faith violation.

Think I’m wrong?  Do it now on a cheap option.  Buy an option for $0.05 with settled funds today, sell it tomorrow, then immediately buy something with that money, and sell it the next day.

TD will be emailing you to inform you of your violation.

https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/amp/trading/how-to-avoid-good-faith-violations-18184
> That's the difference between trading on TDA and robinhood.
Yes. The restriction is on the brokerage only.
Yes, but you will still be limited to 3 day trades in a rolling 5 day period if you have under $25k
Did you already use your one time get out of jail free card?
> I'm not sure what you are talking about.
It’s a poor people thing, it doesn’t concern you.
If you’re close to the 25k barrier you can just deposit enough cash to be over then wait a day but yeah
Switch to a cash account.
Tsla steam ran out… damn this shit about to drop again
Yep
Is lucid a sell, buy or hold?
I’m holding 📈🚀
Its a stock

Rivian too high imo
So, how does Cathy have all that damn money when she sucks so bad at investing lol. Puts on everything she buys is literally free money.
Go ahead I dare you
This is a pretty safe dare
Because last year she was a queen and calls on anything she touched printed. Then she went off the deep end this year. Having said that I’ve sold most of my ark funds during their bounces this year outside of a small arkg position which is just a long term bet on genomics in general for me.
She did bull things in a bull market so people threw money at her.
Bruh how tf is the 485C 11/19 only $5 a pop. Boutta drop $100 in these
For a reason
Bc they will print
Are bulls fuk?  Asking for a friend
No
Did your spy play not work out
It’s working out great. If spy dips, I just keep buying more cheaper calls on a discount and hold

Legit can’t lose money. Nov/dec/jan = bull run
You realize thats like 4.5% up in a week to get ITM right??
https://imgur.com/BXNrd9j

Your point?!
I’m in GME 2.0 should be fun
 So rivian opening at 115, that’ll boost fords stock? Si si?
Yes, Ford owns 102 million shares of Rivian
$22 we ride.
SPY $470 EOW I can feel it
That’ll be tomorrow
Shitse closed tmrw
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
So Rivian's opening indication already dropped a few dollars
lol no it hasnt, it's gonna fly on open watch. itll hit 140 in like 2 minutes
It was recently $120. It dropped to $115 for a sec.
Don't worry, I'm going to fuck it all up by buying -- it is my super power...
After the initial Rivian pop, investors who bought at the $78 ipo price will flock to TSLA
Thinking fords gonan boost?
Yes
Calls at close is the play today, mark my words
Flat days are worse than Red days
RIVN

VROOM,VROOM

🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁
Still got ford calls??
How tf did AMD just drop 5 bucks from yesterday this is bullshit
No look it’s recoverin
It also went from 80 to 120 to 100 to 150. It'll go to 130 and then on acquisition news go to 170. Patience. Su got you.
The news is so good i swear nobody has processed that AMD has new billion$ contracts and new microchip will end the chip shortage
Because it pumped $15 on Monday??
why cant I stop starring at the screen on red days, I need helps ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Elon, please tweet about how you selling more stonks
My poll had a typo. I’ll be selling 100% as I no longer value this material possessions
[deleted]
I could write a sequel called how to lose 5k every day.  one easy step, buy a biotech penny.
Me 10k.. Then repeat it again in couple of weeks but with less money😂my portfolio is like a Rollercoaster
I can co-author it if you’d like that timeframe sped up
rivian more like moonian
its up about 5 dollars from where the average person bought lol
I think I’m the only support for amd now
My calls dead, F
RIVIAN LFG!
Think we could see 20% by close
SoFi said “confirm your ipo shares, you have one hour” last night at 11pm. Fuck my life and fuck SoFi
Yeah, I created an account just for this IPO. That shit definitely sold me on keeping my Fidelity account.
Was it priced at 78$ last night?
Yes $78 for pre ipo. I had the shares allocated but they gave us 1 hour to confirm at fucking midnight? Clearly they didn’t want people to fucking get them
Ya it's definitely shitty but I'll take it. Gonna open an account now for the future.
Burry says TSLA could go to 90. I think it only could happen if Elon dies.
Everyone dies
90T? Damn I’m not even that bullish
45?
A doctor that doesn't like blood.... Probably scared.
I think he's really upset because his theory is not working out.
Wtf is he basing it on. Thing won't even go under 1000.
I preferred it when tsla was at ath and that dude was in a cave somewhere
AMA request: people that bought Rivian at 115+
Im so bored of red
I fuckin hate IPOs. Always crazy high valuations
That opening price values the company around $90 billion, that is bigger than GM and Ford
And they made like 40 cars
Been burned too many times...
[deleted]
Wait til tomorrow 🤡 why don’t you buy some poots rt now
If more than 3 of your comments in a row are about the same ticker (in the vain of "Wow $TICKER is so undervalued buy buy buy") it should be a ban. Permanent. Would clean this place right the fuck up.
**Show your support for VETERANS and buy the dip**
Ford gonna fuckin rip or what. Kinda bullshit they own 12% of a company that just iPO’d at 93 billion and they drop
I’m convinced it’s a scam IPO. Volume is very low.
it was the definition of priced in
LOL@ rivian price action LMFAO
What a joke
So this is all because of the Evergrande default yes?
👍
careful cause tomorrow and friday other 5 could default if they dont pay interests
Godspeed AMD and Godspeed gents. I’m officially yoloed into weekly’s. 145 tomorrow pls. No sleep
For me tonight
Thanks Joe
Yep
Evergrade defaulted goodbye Chinese economy
When rivian options are available I am gonna yolo my portfolio into puts
Bears feast thx elon

sofi doing the nae nae off a cliff right now
Spy 460 coming
Was thinking about spy 460 puts...but it feels wrong.
Because is is wrong.
Honestly we might open below that tomorrow
time to load up on Calls
What’s the market gonna do when it realizes it now has a ton of liquidity it is holding in a rapidly devaluing dollar?
> The market will realize that it has a ton of liquidity in the rapidly devaluing dollar.
Are you sure?  The dollar is up today.  Our inflation report showed we are actually less fucked than the other currencies our dollar is compared to.  Imagine not being the reserve currency while energy and food prices go out of control
https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy/charts

Dollar has actually been moving up recently. We are inflating, but not as fast as everyone else.
I’m down $3000 today holy shit, we needed this correction anyways
Patient!. The market only moves in one direction, UP!
Anyone else feeling an intense pressure in their chest?
> I feel it too.
You will be okay VisualMod, hide behind the vending machine
Inflation hits 32 year high and some people are pissed their calls aren’t printing… come on that one was easy money
Gonna short the market the whole week?
No but I think the day the report came out was a good day for some daily SPY puts that are up 120%
I don't know. I think SPY is gonna end the week over 465
lol inflation news was printing for previous year yet markets will go up in the end
STOP THE COUNT
Come on SPY finish green! I’ve seen crazier things in my 10 months of trading
Retard lives matter, stop the count
Just came here to say fuck PLTR.
You gotta load spy calls on days like today
bears should run out of steam in an hour
The crasheth has cometh
And after z riseth ov z apes shall commence
Inflation is real. 🌈 Taste the 🌈
So….green tomorrow?

No. Retard clapped.

Not tomorrow, prob friday
Another day or two like this and I'm looking at a margin call
Atta boy TSLA, disappoint all the ghey h8ters
Spy can’t go red three days in row right? Should be illegal. So I bought them 466 calls for Friday 😅.
Dude i wouldnt even buy Rivian for 78 lol
It's over, bulls. This is the construction of a narrative. Inflation is here, it's not going away soon, and the market does not like it.
Inflation makes the market go up. Where do people put money to hedge against inflation?
This is only true when it's under control.
No it’s not to look at any case of hyperinflation in the world and look what happens to the markets...  You don’t know what you’re talking about
To the bank if the rates are bigger than inflation which is the case with the normal monetary policy
Magic internet gold.
Jesus . .. US inflation hits 6.2% in October!  That's an absolute joke.  Better to gtfo of dollars.

You absolute lunatics.
F ANNOUNCES 75% STAKE IN RIVN…F TO $50
Lol I would never work again.
All drill teams to Rivian please
Why?
Because they just IPOed at an obscene valuation. New entry point reqd
Rivian looks good if you ignore the valuation
That's like saying u/cashflow_ is quite a catch if you ignore his flaws
That’s our market now
🐻 here. 

You guys are pathetic
You'll lose if you buy puts now. Sell them.
Good morning y’all, don’t forget to hydrate!
TSLA going to need a reverse split soon
I want kimballs fucking head on a platter. 

Or at least close his shitty failing restaurant
MMs aren’t going to let your OTM puts hit just like they do to calls. TSLA will bounce up $20 and trade sideways all day today and rest of week at open. 

🖖
They already have been printing though. They even had to make new strikes yesterday it drilled so hard
The printing was if you bought over 1200.
Dare you to go all-in on condors
B..b..b..but stocks are inflation hedges. Right guys?
All I want for Christmas is a rate hike
That will cause a recession
Sky high Inflation = priced in. Green dildo day.
circuit breakers coming up next

Imagine your portfolio being dependent on Elon not announcing a stock split. Ber are so fuk.
Pltr issued 185$ million worth of stock this Q. That’s half the revenue lmao. Massive dillution to benefit the insiders.

Company established 18 years ago and still has no way to make itself profitable…
but it became a meme because of WSB so now it's hovering at 20s with bagholders
Then just collect theta
Well the stock market is this incredible way for businesses to get money they need to survive...
The problem is when stock market and issuing new shares becomes the sole way to stay afloat
Watch SPY close $470, I would cum so hard
Everyone selling everything else to buy up TSLA. Musk sale completed yesterday.
Anyone who buys RIVN over $60 is a moron
THIS
Where are my boys that got RIVN at $78?
I don't think anyone could, it wasn't open
SoFI let you IoI on the 8th and confirm a buy order locked in at $78 last night.
I was able to get 5 shares.  Sofi gave a 4 hour window to confirm order.  I luckily checked before going to bed or I would have missed out.
The valuation popped so late. I was about to go to bed when I got the notification.
Got my 175.
Out of curiosity, how many shares did you indicate interest in? Seems like most people only got about 40-50% of what they wanted.
I indicated 175, got 175. I funded my account the first day with the $14,000 required so that may have had something to do with it.
Makes sense. I found out about the offering late. Only opened a SoFi account on the 7th, and my funds cleared only yesterday.
18 share
How the fuck do you enjoy seeing the market crash like this go to a doctor
Ford too low imo F F F. F FF F F F F F F
Not liking this
Popeyes spicy chicken sandwich > all other widely available chicken sandwiches. It’s not even close

Evergrande just defaulted, let the fireworks begin baby
Rivian is the next nikola lmao
Hop in for the ride!
Rivian $50 EOW.
Jesus my portfolio is down 20% on the day, never lost this much money in a single day in my life #justAMDthings
Is it just me or does tomorrow feel like a big Green Day?
Yep. Huge Green Day
Bye bye tesla
Honestly PYPL can choke on a cock. Piece of shit of a stonk. Playing around with all the markets it can just to fuck with billionaires meanwhile it wipes out little guys. At this point PYPL free falls wreck the entire market. Fucked up a stonk so insane has that much of a pull. PYPL ruined the great end of year melt up early with its retarded guidance. Legit fuck this stonk
Yikes don't say that. I bought leaps yesterday on it
Should print, I think 3-9 months it will be back up. Only went down on shakey guidance for next quarter.

If next quarter beats guidance,  and their projections further out look realistic it will run.
I need the tendies
it’s guidance was literally 1% off estimates u autist 😂
PYPL sell off has hit max pain threshold. calls it is
You beat 6% inflation with stock market guys.  Everything rally is on 🚀
You beat normal inflation 2% with stonks.  When it's this bad people go crazy and start to either horde, causing a spiral or they pullback a lot and earnings take a massive hit.  Either way the best short-term inflation beta is commodities.  If you want to be risky hipster it's internet $.

Either way, rate hikes are coming way sooner than people think.
Probably not because of the debt us in
Lol tsla bears in shambles. Hope you cashed out yesterday.
I cannot wait until this crock of shit market gets rugpulled
Been saying that since 2015 myself, but:

*don't let it stop you from making money*
Would buying stocks at ATH with P/E over 30 during a little retarted federal monetary policy really make me money? :( This seems to be the case, but it feels strange.
> Yes.
So I have a retirement account I've been accumulating since 1990.  I pick individual stocks and have beat the S+P every year.

Just dicking with calls and puts - mostly calls - and starting from a $2000 stake, I have accumulated half the value of my retirement account in just one month of trading.  This is not a market that rewards careful valuation.
Wow, that's impressive, congrats!

You’re the next stuck pig *squeal*
True
Inverse WSB, everyone thinks we are dipping so buy calls
Right there with you.
Honestly great advice. Everyone say buy Dash puts but here I am with calls and soon to be money in the bank.
Today is the day. SPY crossed the daily 5ema in premarket. There's nowhere good to put money. Bond yields are falling, equities are falling, cash is losing value... something has got to give. Until they raise rates, it's not equities.
Let's see how that works out for you.
Honestly Elon can choke on a cock. Piece of shit of a human. Playing around with all the markets he can just to fuck with billionaires meanwhile it wipes out little guys. At this point TSLA free falls wreck the entire market. Fucked up a guy so insane has that much of a pull. He ruined the great end of year melt up early with his retarded tweets. Legit fuck this guy

Yep that’s me. Not even playing Tesla but I fucked myself again
A fucking ev company with barely any revenue worth more than all car companies combined and you blame the CEO? Blame the retards here that pumped that stock with unholy amount of call options

Sounds like you’re bag holding like a retard instead of taking profits lmao
That's why I'm buying RIVIAN
lmao is this a copypasta
Welcome to capitalism
RIVN it is then!!
Tax the fuck outta him then.
At what point do you have to buy in to a historic bull run that you’re “ruined” after it drops a couple percent then goes back up 4% today? Either you bought too high or your timing was bad, both of which have fuck all to do with an elongated muskrat.
Imagine thinking the tsla drop is responsible for the market wide dip.
I’d say one of the biggest stocks on SPY and Nasdaq falling 12% makes them sell off so
Inflation it’s just transitory, I got a small cock.

Have you ever wanted to invest in cum?

$CYRX
I used to work in a lab where we tested it, like to see if the vasectomy worked or for fertility. Shit smells awful. I guess it's like a fart. Your own farts don't smell anywhere near as bad as someone else's. I felt so dirty.
What does it mean then if your own cum reeks?
i don't know about that. what's it smell like exactly? i was just a tech so mainly just put it into an expensive machine and made sure the machine's results matched the SOPs results. is it smelling differently than it normally does?

just be sure to check it out. i was in the ER for a time. it's very sad what people put off. One guy was just totally pissing blood from some VD that he hadn't treated for a LONG time out of embarrassment.
Shit, actually might have to get checked out. Thanks for the tip
You should cut back on your Asparagus intake.

At least yours actually went out til next year. I thought my 3-months-out strategy was enough time smh
Good
staying away from $SOFI until post earnings. If they don’t announce the charter AND options trading the stock will drop even if they beat earnings and give good guidance. This market is a fickle bitch rn, will buy if it drops under $20
It also pumped like 80% in the last 2 months so
Options trading? Where did you get that from?
huh? it’s old news man. they have been testing it out for weeks for certain users, supposed to be ready EOY
so buy puts instead?lol
planning on buying 5k shares to sell CCs for the next year if it drops below $20
I'm not even hungry 

But I want spaghetti
Rivn will be $120 when it reaches retail
Then all fomo makes it 250

Then 75 holders drop it, guess what who holding bags?
Everyone here that buys it at $350 :)
Sadly yeah. Trying to decide what kind of order to place
Biden speaks at 4 PM regarding infrastructure bill... but he hasn't even signed it yet after pushing it on everyone lol

Will Rivian valuation and ipo today hurt LCID or help them?
I thought help for sure but looks like one wrong
At least we know people bought LCID in the 40s. So we will get back here and higher in the future. Just need to give it time.
people bought GME a year ago in the +$300's ask them how that turned out.
I guess it helps.  Both are worth as much as ford lol

Isn’t high inflation good for stocks?
It has the opposite effect, if no one can save money with the cost of living being crazy, no one will be able to afford to buy stocks and people will be selling stocks to afford to live
Six months ago it was at 9%. Also 80% of stocks are owned by rich people. I think indices rocket back tomorrow if not later today.
We haven’t seen inflation this bad since 1990
Rich people probably selling stocks at all time highs to buy low possibly as well
Not when you're running at 6%, it messes with forward earnings and future borrowing costs for a company
Its like killing the economy of a country
40% cash right now feels good, but that other 60%...yikes.
I've only got INTC and FB left. Gone cash on the rest and thinking about selling FB.
Please let amazon open green so i can dump my calls

Buy Platinum if you think auto industry will recover next year.  Platinum is at a deficit already in production.  Auto industry will be forced to buy at any price.  Will double within 12 months.

Yes

CME you can trade options.  I’d go 6 mo out.  I’m sticking to physical bullion.  Bought mine off jmbullion website.
Nope, the hair color
What about recycling
It’s a fraction of production.  Again, already at a deficit and less recycling will happen because people will be so massively upside down in used auto loans.  Makes me want to buy Autozone after next correction.

why do i need to? LMAO make your own plays.

You don't "need" to do anything, just shut the fuck up and stop pretending you're a prophet if you don't post DD.

It’s gonna leave the universe and enter the multiverse. Buy now for quick retirement.
Just like Icarus.
Lmao the only stocks that goes up are the ones I wanna buy…fuck this shit
I laughed yesterday but two red days in a row? Now I’m scared
Days not over yet
gave up on my nvda calls and sold for a massive loss. from 15k to 32k to 1k in a week. blew out almost all my savings, feels like absolute dog shit. i'm done. unless it hits 330 by friday my ban bet will be lost so that'll help me stay away from here.
Lol now it will hit 400 and you will fomo your mother’s life savings before it hits 200
aha ha thanks im gonna kill myself
Went straight up when you sold. Just come back in
May I suggest buying em a few months out? It’s been printing with said method
Those premiums are steep now though because of that pump
True, when it cools off a bit.
yeah i think if i make another move it'll be like jan 2022 calls or something, day trading and the weeklies are no good for me i get greedy or stupid or both. i carefully built my shit from 15k to 30k then blew it all so quickly
Currently living the same life. It hurts; I cried. I hope you make a strong comeback my friend. Lost 11k in a day 3 weeks ago on some FDs.

Hi
Spy with the bear trap love to see it
Heres what happens,  wall street types get in at 78. Then retail comes in and the price is $120. Retail buys while wall street sells making a quick 54% gain and leaves retail holding the bag.

Then over timw the stock drops to 40s where it belongs
Thought people who get in pre-IPO can’t sell for 30 days?
> What did you just say? I think you said something really stupid.
Lol
IDFK, that’s what my dude at Morgan Stanley told me.
I said over time
By the time Rivian goes public, it’ll be a thing of the past
The thing I am suspicious about with Rivian is their ADAS and infotainment system is based on Amazon-sourced hardware, which we all know is garbage. It will make their 75k vehicles look extremely out of date and deficient in comparison to other similarly priced vehicles from Tesla and Lucid and even Ford. That's not good, and it is suspicious that despite having so many deliveries all the reviews seem to be extremely superficial and don't seem to address this problem.
If your buying rivian for anything other than a day trade I’ll gladly walk you to the nearest mental hospital, we can even stop by Wendy’s on the way and get you a job application
My SENS calls are printing today!!
Why is Ford stock so low? They own a big chunk of Rivian.
Legacy costs, mostly pensions.
That's the reason as they are basically helping fund a competitor for some reason. Every Rivian sold is one less Ford sold.
They own 12%. Amazon owns 21%. Ford is a steady slow gainer, which the Ford family still owns 30% of the stock.
Maybe priced in?

Yeah

It’s not. Rivian is raising 12 billion. Alibaba raised 21 billion.
Im starting to think that BoA had something right when they said SPY to 425 at end of year......................
I’m a vet.. so therefore I want to be compensated with tendies

Yes I bought after the previous earnings about 3 months ago. Very dumb are people who were in back from February. It’s coming soon!

You have Coin calls too?
Yes… and dash puts ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
I would hug you if I could. More so cause I need a hug. Funny thing is I sold my coin calls yesterday on the run up for a nice win. Bought the dip yesterday and had a limit sell for 30% gain but decided to get greedy. Now looking at 80% loss.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)Thanks kind stranger but it is only 2.5k out of my less than 10k portfolio. Bad thing is I was up on my coin call for $400 at the end of the day but realized that I’m poor and didn’t have any day trades left and couldn’t get rid of it. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Anybody playing SOFI ER? i got a bun or 22 & 23 calls but idk if its worth it at this point
Look at last ER and most Tech ERs. Plus the huge run up over last 2 months, most likely gonna dip. However I sold my leaps 2 weeks ago and will gladly rebuy them on a sell off so it will probably open up 20%
> I sold my Leaps 2 weeks ago and will gladly rebuy them on a sell off so it will probably open up 20%
Wouldn’t take the risk…Even big beats on Earnings doesn’t prevent a dip.
They are 11/19 & 12/03 so i should have room for a rebound right?
I wouldn’t feel super great about the chances. When did you buy?
Last thursday & friday. Down 700 out of 8k but i've been averaging down so that helped a lot
Significant chance of IV crush then. What’s the premium you paid? Entirely possible that SoFi moons enough to at least break even, but I don’t think I’d make that bet.
I don't like DST, the vamp in me wants another hour of morning darkness
OK, so PRPL actually going single digit today? Jeez.

SHOOOOOOPPPP AHHHH
No no no! Too many people capitulating. Not yet, you’re too early!
Can anyone explain why NVDA was such a big deal in the comments yesterday? It doesn't even seem like it moved all that much. Like over the week I get it but yesterday specifically, I was expecting it to be up like $200 from the comments here.
We’re getting to the point where $25 movements aren’t a big deal for a company like NVDA 😳
It says it moved $2 on my ticker. Is my ticker broken!?
Pre market yesterday $325 yet ended the day red and broke $300 low was 299.64 very volatile for one day
Ok thanks.  Appreciate it
Np lots of people also make things a huge deal since they’re playing weekly options or even same day expiration and even a slight movement means losing or making money
It was up huge at open yesterday, then tanked. Should go back up. Get in before earnings run up next week
So bet against NVDA, got it. Now if only I had a few extra thousand dollars to spend on puts
Ha, yeah, you never know.
I'm just glad that I sold my main stocks at a profit only to see them keep going up... and up.   
But I kept the ones that kept going down and down as to mitigate the possibility that I may actually come out net positive.

I have learned a lot here! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)

Anyone else looking into industrial REIT stonks? Warehouses particularly that lease to own/rent out?
It's not the best to buy reits before you're old because the dividends get taxed hard and I don't think they really grow that fast typically but I can't fucking stop because I like to see the occasional few hundred dollars drop into my account and offset the few thousand in losses.
Fair point, but would it not go up in price as we transition away from the traditional mall amd the companies are all going on line sales, so they need to build and store their products somewhere? And with the current truck driver shortage and back up of containers at sea where are they going to store it all? Or am I just way off?

Edit: thank you for your reply
> You are way off. I have no idea what you are talking about, but it sounds like a lot of stuff.
If you can’t understand what I said, than you need to give yourself a flurry of uppercuts
Possibly but how many of those reits also have office building holdings in the portfolio which would be very at risk with the transition to work from home seemingly becoming more accepted.  Typically the big ones are either residential only or commercial only, I am sure there might be some that are specific to warehouses only but if they're small they might be more subject to volatility.
Ok.  This is all good information that I must consider.   Thank you for your time.

DASH makes no sense. Going to try to buy puts after open. Pray for me.
Softbank won’t let you.
I will continue to buy any dip in SPY and also hope I get filled on RIVN
Anyone following the IREN IPO?
Noooooo fvrr was supposed to crash over night
Lmao
I really gotta make up my mind then do the exact opposite. My puts are fukt at opening
Is F going up or down today. Had a pretty flat day
I’ll let you know when the market opens and keep you updated.
I’m so dumb. F at $12, should have bought more
F is going to be hard today. No one is sure if they will invest more in Rivian or get out
Yes. It is either going up or down. Maybe even both intraday.

Monday I put on covered puts for TSLA 11/26 1120/1150 and 12/17 1150/1190, both are around $22 from $10. Should I hold them to expiry for the extra $8 intrinsic value, but risk being burned by that Elon Majik? I'm sorely tempted to just take the profit and move on before Musk announces he's moving to Mars or some shit that pushes TSLA back to ATH.

I hate to be one of those people, but based on what I can find, DASH is 7.26% shorted and there are a crap load of calls with strike prices between yesterday's close and the current price.  I think it may continue to run for the next couple of days.
are my amzn puts going to devastate my portofolio?
Yes

So how much money SOFI gonna make off the RIVN IPO?
Lmk, how far will we drop today before er
FUBO tryin to be dead, dead. Glad my poots gonna print
Remember if VIX over 20 there will be more selling pressure. Would definitely wait before buying calls today
Lots more people talking about inflation here in my part of the swamp. Maybe even slipping new adders into contracts that allow for price increases on the consumer along with CPI. 

Honestly wouldn’t be surprised to see prices higher next year. Specifically since big brain Powell already telegraphed he ain’t doing shit.
25% cash, I guess the play is to buy stocks on discount
Yea get rid of that cash you crazy bull

I will channel the ghost of Michael Burry today for rainbow gains
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

I was so close to buying way OTM puts on DASH
I bought one.
So many other stocks have bled so much like PTON and SNAP. Seeing the massive gains really had me itching but I think Dash will probably be wrecked come 2022 earnings on later quarters
Yea. My put is probs fucked. Maybe but it still got 3 days

That’s what I thought too. But apparently it’s the most oversubscribed ipo ever per Cramer

I’m a huge creeptoe bull and have been since 2016. That said, I really hope COIN rips as high as possible over the next ~6 months as we near the end of this market cycle. Once it ends, and it will, all the coins will dive 70-80% and stay there and COIN will be the short opportunity of the decade.
Was fucking NEGG a pump and dump or something?

Jfc
Negg pumps randomly af big dips can be pretty profitable it was down around $10 last week
What y’all think about affirm earnings?
Thinking about playing a straddle/strangle on SOFI. Thoughts?
Not going anywhere near RIVN at that price point
Anyone smart enough to buy calls at open? Took less than an hour for SPY and QQQ to straight line back to near even lol.
LODE Cumshots missed....
PLTR down on a downgrade from an analyst. But that analyst is the Royal Bank of Canada

Day of the rake can't come soon enough
RRR has reported higher than anticipated earnings for 3 quarters.

Today they announced a 350m buy back and a $3 special dividend.

I really want to buy NIO but the market is illogical
SENS with amazing earnings holy fk
Haven’t seen this green color since last week 😤
SENS good earnings, 30% short interest and fda approval any day now
Hope you bought the dip on your favorite names.
Thanks for iv crush to get cheap weeklies on COIN😘😘
AMD seems like it reached some support
Can we buy RIVN yet
Wonder how many people lost money off of that FVRR ER DD

Why would you ever have anything to do with those two companies

Yeah, I'm staying away from Rivian for now. Too hot for my liking. Good luck though.
shit will be down 50% in 3 days
Wrong way nasdaq
The Ford nut up is going to be insane.
It fucking better be. If Rivian hits $120, Ford just suddenly holds like $12 billion dollars worth of Rivian stock.
Oh snap, I did not know this thanks
I bought leaps and not looking back. Let it ride
I want to know who's buying DWAC. SERIOUSLY.. WTF
Looks like a lot of people have been buying at $55/56 and selling at $60 the last couple of weeks

Lol if a small cap jumps above 15% u sell
Can someone explain to my why DASH is pumping so hard? I see nothing positive from the earnings or the overpriced acquisition.
I'd be curious to see how much of the action is genuine buying and selling versus algorithms relentlessly trading a few shares back and forth
TLT puts the move?
I need to Know the WSB consensus on SOFI so i can inverse it
Uhh… buy puts? 😬

Topped out
It's one of those days for the SPY. It'll end green on Friday and flat for the week
*moans oh yeah tsla you gonna make me average up
Hiw did Wendy's do
beat eps, tiny miss on rev, guidance - supply chain issues & labor issues for q4.  glad I didn't play pre-earnings.  i bought some shares after it dipped this morning.
Thoughts on Affirm mooning AH? This pre earnings dip smells fishy
Debating picking up some Affirm or Upstart. Both juicy dips...
I’m conflicted on this one. I was thinking puts, but now, I’m really not sure 🤔
Last three AH sessions. Giant dips. 🧐
Right, but it seems to have traditionally pumped ahead of earnings
everything down including vix my brain is fried
I think I'm going to sell my Tilray and buy either Rivian or Mango warrants. Also yes I am retarded
PLTR: We had a great quarter!  
  
Market: Plummets 14%  
  
This is a no brainer, gonna massive load it up and sell covered calls on this.
Is that you Cathie?
It's only 5%
Dropped 9% yesterday after earnings
I know how you feel, check out TELL -13% so far on no news
Celsius puts if anyone here is actually in the business of making money
Yeah, palantir is honestly just a fucked up stock
Look at the earnings… they diluted 185$ millions and earnings was 392 mill. Compound it with ceo insider trading, this stock is worth 18$
The only thing fucked up is investors trying to trade it on a quarterly basis. It's simply not that kind of investment. Trying to time the market is a fools errand. Even more so with a stock that doesn't profile as volatile in the first place.
what's the next RBLX for earnings
BMBL is my bet
Sell your roblox founder was accused of child rape

Thoughts on PENN?? seems oversold on low volume...

Am I crazy for wanting to buy AMD calls after I sold my other ones for a loss?
buy a further strike at least
I sold 160s I wanna buy 150 for next week
Damn AFRM dumping more lol
TSLA hitting my expectation of recovering 3-5%. Question is if it holds
Fake rally. Elons gonna tweet over the weekend
this feline is no more! it  has ceased to exist!
Damn cut my losses but at least I learned some valuable lessons
Well I guess no rivn for me. Will wait for the dump.
somebody here got NEGG'd hard today. you fool.
why they gotta do PLTR like this
I think it'll rebound
Hope so. It sure seemed like it at 10:00AM but they brought it right back down. Hopefully they're stop loss hunting here.
Was Musk's poll an attempt to take some of the air out of Rivian? If so it didn't work.
What’s happening to affirm? Do I hold these outs through earnings?
Coin toss. Earnings will be bad but don’t know if it’s already priced in with the recent drop.
It's gotta be right? If it goes UPST style I guess it could lose another 5-10%. I guess it has tripled since AMZN announcement. Ugh I can't decide what to do.
I would take profits if you have them, playing earnings is always a coin toss especially as of late. I could easily see affirm having terrible earnings and just rebounding 10% for no reason
I don't own any yet and have been waiting for a dip. Considering buying half now and seeing what happens on earnings. Could go either way!
Sell
So this is what a pull back looks like
Kinda hard to scalp tickets if you have to pay $150 a pop
Is affirm about to shit the bed on earnings bigger than Z and PTON?
> No.
Yes.
My puts would love that
FUBO is disrupting my portfolio this morning.

HUGS SPAC 🤗 
Anticipation for Panera Bread 🥖
Timing?
If ford sells their stake in Rivian they are set to make about 10b in profit at these IPO prices. 

This would pump their quarterly earning by maybe 25%. 

So we could see Ford at $25 by EOW? Is that how this math works?
They won’t be able to sell their shares in the lock up period, so buy calls for March-May.
Doesn't matter.  They book the shares at Mark-to-Market, so the assets on the Balance Sheet show the immediate increase.
That's how math works, but the market is all voodoo and cocaine, not math. But I'm long F on that math.
Cocaine math is still math bro
They won't sell. Rivian is a partner.
You don’t have to actually sell to have equity
Ford at 25? You're out of your mind.
No...they couldn't sell for minimum 120 days
They don’t have to sell to show the equity on their books.
Possibly more based off of hype- we saw what happened with Tesla
No because 30 years of profits are priced in. A one time 25% quarterly earnings pump would increase the stock price .8% by the math
why did I own MU for months instead of AMD or NVDA. I'm such a cheap dumpster-rummaging bitch
Are you hot at least?
Is it possible NVDA finishes above 300 today?
Prob not
Guessing you’re saying that because you want it below 300 right?
No unfortanatley its being treated like a meme stock which is a joke.  Its a solid company and shouldnt drop below $300 in my opinion.  But here we are.

Inflation is fucked yo
Should I buy the dip in Draftkings or PENN??
Neither
$DKNG seems like a good buy RN.
PENN
DKNG looking cheap, penn also.  Get both
I picking up a little of each as it’s been dipping.  Will rise again
I bought Draftking calls so Penn will be the money maker
$VIA is taking off this week. energy crisis will get worse
Looking for OPEN to pull a RBLX. Been holding JAN calls for a while. I was looking for it to hit $28. Not enough money to care if it goes but would be cool if it mooned.
What dip we buyin
AMD
Salsa
INTC gonna hover around 51.10 all day like it did yesterday
So where do people put their money if inflation is an issue? I assume the Bitcorn and market.
Real estate?
Nonstop selling on AMD fml
WISH contextlogic….hold or sell before earnings ???
that shit been sitting around $5-$6 for months. I think it's going to go up soon

Supposedly there will be 2-3 rate hike but 2 rate hike is 100% sure of it

Should I get a drone? 

DJI Mavic 2 or DJI Air2S
I don’t want a race/freestyle drone I want a drone for filming

What would you recommend?
Long range freestyle rigs are fantastic for filming... unless of course you mean stationary (boring AF).
Dude, recommend a drone or why are you commenting
You want "a drone"... I don't do those. I build mine. A 7" with some very torque-y motors (I like PyroDrone) and good heavy lift capacity. I like Andy Shen's frames.
Cool, I have $1500 to spend at micro center so I’m not doing what you’re suggesting.
Mavic 3
I own a few in the Mavic series. If you’re just getting started either the Air 2S or 2 Pro are excellent drones. The 3 Pro in my opinion is it quite worth the price difference unless you’re getting serious very quickly. Get the 2 Pro over Air 2S IMO. That variable aperture is more helpful than you might imagine.
I don’t want to invest too heavily when I don’t even know how to fly them yet. Trying to keep it under 1k. Limit at $1200
2S. Mavic 3 if you’re loaded. I have mini 2 and few fpv drones. Wished i got air 2s for object avoidance and follow.

Wtf I thought November supposed to be bullish
It’s not over yet!
Couldn’t imagine it would have anything to do with sky high inflation, supply chain issues, labor shortages, evergrande defaulting or any of the other major factors affecting the economy right now.

i have puts rn and i’m losing money!
Selling a Put a PLTR with a $22 strike price for Jan 2022, if it keeps tanking atleast I get 100 shares at $22 + the premium, why not ?
Enjoy tying that money up for 8 weeks for $100
$150, but if it PLTR shoots up a lot before then I might just buy back the option , I actually would like to buy the shares if the stock tanks around 20-22

Really confused right now. VIX and SPY both down. WHAT DOES IT MEAN!?
Healthy selling after nice runup
Which would increase volatility. However this isn’t the case. Volatility is going down. Also the dollar and yields are rising.
Inflation numbers are out but they were bad so less volatility but bad

Correction inbound. The SPY/QQQ run for the past 40 days has been absolutely ridiculous. Chip companies like NVDA/AMD/QCOM are also way overextended on their pumps

i wonder how Ford feels after investing in rivian and seeing it open at a higher mkt cap than ford
At least they own 12% of this nonsense. Too bad the market doesn't give a fuck that Ford just picked up $10 billion dollars, for some reason.
Now maybe they will merge together one day.
Zynga still pumping and on track for a serious turnaround
Lmao Rivians market cap is higher than Ford’s.
I’m farting shitless rn
Reverse diamond hands y'all
Gtfo… Rivian at $111?
108...7
Rivian kinda running outta steam…0
damn was that a textbook cat bounce?
When do options on rivian become available?
Just bought another share of metaverse...will buy a few more if it drops below $310.
So what is Ford doing?
Losing my money.
WISH has been a dog but i could see it ripping on good guidance
TIMBERRRRRR

Goodbye SPY. I still love you 😢
Bull trap kinda day…
What were people able to buy Rivian at through SOFI?
Ford is fucking me raw
Lol wtf AMZN
Naked greasy gay bear orgy happening 🐻
only news im seeing on this SPY selloff is evergrande defaulting and some shit about a 30y bond auction
Evergrande stuff was out this morning. 30 year auction just got announced.
It's a technical move and algo driven. Now that the daily RSI is out of overbought, we can have green candles again.
Will Rivian crash and burn once options are available?
What just happened?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
We going down down down
Is AAPL SPY, or is SPY AAPL?
I sold ze puts. You have my permission to go back up again, NASDIQ
30 year bond auction goes for 0 basis points or is inventing.com lying to me
Losing some on my Ford calls... No worries my SoFi puts will print.
#My ass hurts
omg, I just went back to my port 1+ month ago. holy fuck suck a dick spy
When BABA and TSLA are the only things green today on your portfolio....
Fed is responsible for my losses
They can only make 2 cars a today. They have a difficult road ahead. Getting production high almost broke Elon musk. It’s not easy. 

And they’re the largest IPO since 2014.
With 20% Amazon ownership 12 billion in cash and an order for 100,000 cars with more coming
When others are shitting their pants…

make sure your dog don’t try to lick it up.
Dear gosh.....the FOMO....

You sure about that cause I can only see it will close on Thanksgiving day November 25.
hold my spy 12/6 call or sell?
I’ve lost so much on my EOY calls that it’s not even worth selling,🚀🚀🚀
wondering the same thing at this point. should’ve sold when i was up 1000% on friday.
I say we hold. unless of-course you’re over leveraged, in which case I’d say sell.
I am right there with you. Reality of the economy hasn’t mattered the last year and a half and with Black Friday/Christmas spending coming up I’d be shocked if it starts being realistic now.

Can’t believe I saw this on here, are the Newsmax rumors true?
I'm banking on it dude. This could be a DWAC but with options
Do you know where the rumor is coming from? I’ve seen it once on Twitter and haven’t been able to find anything else on it
I'm gonna take an hour or two tonight to look deeper into it

Ahh back to normal. AMD for a second was beating NKLA's monthly gains but we've reverted and the fraudulent EV company is finally back to better gains than AMD. good stuff. Glad I'm going to get liquidated
Maybe I should have bought some puts
Almost bought SPY FDs. Glad I held off
PLTR back to 22. Until the end of time
Am I seeing that correctly? $68B market cap for rivian?
no, 900m outstanding shares x $112 price is $100.8B
$100B+
68 billion isnt cool, you know whats cool? 68 trillion.
How you not say 69 billion?

Try nothing. This place fucking sucks so bad on certain days. Everyone just acting like their own holdbaby is the only stock people should buy.

I'm going to write a Python script that gapes your asshole with a spoon and force feeds you the contents.
Watch for the rebound for SPY, this is just a slight pullback. Zoom out and see we're headed for 490 after this selloff
Anybody who says zoom out is trying to sell you something
We're still clearly in a bull run if you look back into September and October. If this pull-back did not happen, we would have had an incredibly Sharp downturn eventually. The longer you go without a healthy correction, the more drastic the fall
I think the phrase is overused, but not always wrong

Guys, if you aren't buying (some fucking dumbass ticker most of you haven't heard of) then what are you even doing?!

Oh me? No, I didn't just put my life savings of $260 into that ticker. Totally not.

You should buy it.
Spy, prog, f or amd calls. Just haven't decided.
I’m afraid of the market to keep dipping if I buy spy calls
Lol yesterday WSB was saying Dash puts and Coin calls. Not going to lie, the Dash puts thesis had legs. I’m glad I didn’t throw 10k into Dash puts because I would have gotten smoked.

Ah yes, this must be the gigachad whos up 10,000% on his plays and has never once had a bad play. Show me da wei
No I've bought some dogshit before. I'm just saying diamond hands is much easier when you have rock solid faith because it's an actual decent company with solid performance. I will still buy some degen shit though.

Perfect time for PSFE earnings they could report $10 billion revenue this quarter and still tank on this market sentiment
If you're TLRY gang just make sure you hang yourself with a hemp rope
Omfg I’m ready for these dips🤑🤑🤑🤑
They tried to let me off with a slap on the wrist this morning, but I chose to do hard time
damn VIX kinda trying to go to 20
I love VIX but sold my calls yesterday
Uh oh - the end must be nigh
Is Ford buying $PINS?
Well TSLA, you tried to make me money. I'm just too dumb to drink when the water is in front of me
Last chance to sell your meme shit before rumblings of rate hikes happening sooner
Bought the dip twice today, is third the lucky one?
> You think you know something?
I em skerred.
Nvda going under 290 isn’t it
 Not even a relief bounce 😢

It’s too early to itchy fingers

This will play out the whole of nov 

Unless u trade intra day with superb precision

Has anyone ever used $SQ for anything other than paying random coke dealers?

And only time I ever see them used by businesses is at food trucks that cause your asshole to invert.
A lot of small businesses in metro areas, especially those "up and coming" areas use it. I see it all the time.
I'm taking it in the rear with no lube from buying dips on Ford calls. 500 1/21/22 $30.
Damn the 30 strike? You belong here
I'm actually amazed how I lose so often lately lol.  Held paypal from 225 thought I made a big brain play when it hit 244, got creamed and sold thought to myself "I'll play it safe with some long SPY calls" fking REKT lol
Seriously. I'm holding SPY a month out and I'm getting destroyed. Feels bad, man.
Mine are for march so I'm probably fine but still it's almost comical lmao
Was down -30%.. sold all my calls for loss. Switched to puts. Now I’m green. 

Don’t fight the trend 🤷🏻‍♂️
Let’s see below 460
LOWER DADDY!

Just an absolutely cheeky slide this afternoon
IPO - narrator ‘ only the good die young’
People on the FP talking about how they know loan officers denying third or fourth mortgages to people because they just keep trying to flip houses and it's "risk-free".

Lol wtf is this 🤡 everything bubble?  I guess when real interest rates are the lowest they have ever been in history, by far, this is what happens.
It’s a giant global casino on a level never before seen
Real estate is in a giant bubble. My neighbor got 800k for their shitty house in a neighborhood that cost half that five years ago
Be pretty neat to see something bounce.  Just so I can clutch onto hope tonight

Haven't been here in a few months, is this a good time to come back in?
As good as any I guess.  The TSLA bulls are a bit upset today, but otherwise it is business as usual around here.
Spy will continue to bleed tomorrow?
Is AFRM priced in?
I’m buying calls at the end of the day yeah
Wow calls!? Good luck comrade
bought some NIO weeklies

Not the best day to come out with a ipo lmao
SPY rebounding, place your bets & buy the dip now boysss
TSLA about to dive.

I knew I should fukin quit when Dash went up 20% last night
buy high, sell low 

\- this sub stemming the bleeding
How am I down $600 right now?
So apparently I am the support for amd
Atleast this time we’re dropping for a solid reason
What’s the reason
Inflation being up biggly
Is there ever a reason to buy on IPO day, unless all the planets align and you swing it 30 mins later?
If you buy an IPO you either have to hold it forever or sell it after open that is it anything else is just stupid
7 hrsof bleeding

but but market at highs says the clowns
Get some hemorrhoid cream.

Buy when RSI buttons out on the 6 month chart. Easy money and will probably be there after next week
fucking multiverse, thought i was in the green one
i think we're up for the rest of the week from this point on. then, i'm expecting it to go down next week for the monthly 19 dip. after that, up i guess? all it ever does and we just had a pretty big pullback in september.

AFRM AH plays? Idk why Q4 guidance would miss like UPST
wondering about AFRM myself.  But UPST though had a great report, and great guidance...don't know what happened there
UPST run up has been insane
Not quite, Q4 projected EBITDA < Q3. If I had to guess, AFRM prob has better chances?
Hope you're right cause I bought the AFRM dip today.  And once again I'm being impulsive like my one year old Golden Retriever when she sees a rabbit...
Yeah, only on the fence thanks to this market selloff
...which is the smart thing to do lol
Retards, is $WISH heading to $3 or$7 after earnings? Trying to make a reasonable bet.

We won’t be worrying about money if SPY crashes to $100.
My account is fucked whether spy goes to 450 or 100, so we may as well make it 100 to at least make things interesting
Just make it quick

Same bullshit happened in september too.  Sat at around 230 for a bit and then tank all the way down to 190.  Seems to be a trend for this stock now.  Acting like a meme stock
Yep so fucked so annoying . The light here turned off on one red candle now everyone sells
Bruh, I have 20+ different positions and all of them are red rn.

No Christmas gifts this year
elon musk may be selling off his shares right now the price dropping too quick
What? With this volume?
im using rh so i cant see the actual volume but its my assumption
NVDA and AMD next rug pulls after TSLA
So calls now?
AMD actually has excellent fundamentals
Reminder folks... Brainard is even more dovish than JPow.  That's the alternative at the Fed; she's other one interviewing.

If Brainard gets the nod (and gets through the Senate)... inflation could go higher.
I hope brainerd gets in. She would be so dovish
Would she go for negative rates?
So AMD is officially dead on this run? I want to hold my December calls but it's not looking good
Massive pullback! Sell if u can
I would give it a few days.
It’s literally where it was halfway through the day on Monday after it’s first 5% pump.
Calm down
thanks nvda i am gonna unalive myself now
Alright retards, let me break it down for you. 

CAT, is an infrastructure play. It popped good way back when they first started talking about it. Then Monday it popped on the passing of the bill and has been going down, most infrastructure play have been. Wanna know why? Because Joe isn't signing the bill until the 15th at the soonest. When he signs it will pop again. 

Buy this CAT dip and sell on the signature pop.
Musk can go fuck himself for his shenanigans
Tesla pump is fake and gay. Nothing has changed, don’t get burnt.
Spy just don’t be a fucking bitch recover please and follow Tesla Jesus Christ
Inflation has outperformed bears’ portfolios this year
SPY wants to go green so bad
Put a 1,000 stock order in for RIVN at $20 limit which is a more than fair price, all based on speculation cause it's not even worth that atm
You may think that’s a fair price, but that order will not fill today
it's the principal
at MOST 25, fuck this 135 shit
lol it's likely to price in 3x that $20 in just pure speculation alone.  that's how absurd this has gotten
It will open at $120 is the latest
lol at PLTR being nearly 20% off it's recent high before earnings.
Hurdy fukn dur. Inflations bad!?!? Oh 💡let me just pull all my money out into cash so that it loses value instead of growing in the stock market. 

💡💡💡💡💡💡💡💡💡💡💡💡💡💡💡💡
Problem is once the inflation stops and rates start going up the markets gonna crash. Its not if but when it happens we’ll be in the greatest depression ever created. Have fun for now I guess looking at pretty numbers on a screen.
Obviously I was joking, but they should’ve raised interest rates much earlier and they still haven’t so they’re still putting off the inevitable.
I agree. Them stimulus checks and shit was so dumb. Should have just the economy tank and take it like a man. Instead were more fucked now than we were during Covid. Oh and don’t forget we got two $1 trillion plus dollar spending bills to put on top of it all. 🤡🌎
What's stopping you from shorting?
Im not rich enough to short the market lol. You need to borrow shares with interest to short. Plus this market is still running up and will continue to do so probably well into next year. I’m just pointing out the fact that soon the party will be over and most investors will be completely wiped out. Buffet has been sitting on the sidelines with $250 billion in cash just salivating and waiting. The markets a long game but everyone on this sub is after short term satisfaction/dopamine
You have to pull out money to rotate into short positions.
I love bag bitches that's my fuckin problem.

Is rivian a short term move?
Probably wouldn't touch it if you can't get out before closing today. This is a day trade, no doubt about it.
Yeah im gonna let it spike then dump it
When is it gonna start trading
BUY OR DONT BUY FORD WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON
Def buy
Buy
Buy moar
Mopar you say?
Buy
Buy
That's a no from me dawg.

Zoom out and ook at their stock in the last 10 and 20 years. 

Also the few things Ford does good in are priced in.

They also carry like 100 bil+ in debt. Hell, they are still haunted by government loans they took over a decade ago. (Ford PR and commercials played it off like they never accepted government assistance but they did while blasting rivals for it)

They wanted like 9 bil.to get a jump start on evs. Yet still to this day they are planning evs in the next half decade thatd compete with a shitty chevy bolt you can buy now.
Buy and go long long long
Rivian already tanking?
Too damn high
Rivian a buy?
No its super overvalued
Unless you got IPO no. Wait a week or two once the hype has blown. It will crash as pretty much every IPO does then evaluate a buy. Don't chase and give big money your tendies.
10 Y yield up to a whopping... 1.55%. I bet boomers are buying the shit out of this bond dip to get those sweet -4.5% returns.
China Evergrande has officially defaulted.

This means the CCP is paying their bills. They're being bailed out.
You idiots need to understand financial theory: inflations INCREASES the value of expected future cash flows, as a result, securities will APPRECIATE. This is not financial advice and I’m not a financial advisor.
You troll
No, it really is a financial concept.
Short term bad 

Long term good
Exactly, people hear inflation and shit their pants and act irrational - but over the long term it could cause accelerated appreciation.
how does it increase it? Nominally or in real terms? What do you mean by value? Is it present value or future value? What increases, the cash flows, the value of cash flows, or both? For a financial theorist, you need to work on your terminology. Inflation effectively reduces the present value of expected future cash flows. As for cash flows themselves, they might increase depending on the firm's ability to increase its prices and generate more revenues (in nominal terms) in an inflationary environment, but that has nothing to do with real value, which always goes down with inflation.
Market just loves to tease bears. You honestly have to feel for them hopefully they cashed out
all my banking friends, who run investment firms within the bank, say they've been quietly and slowly exiting positions in equity, moving to bonds. Don' want to spook the market, exiting all quiet like.
It happens nearly every time toward the end of year. The market suddenly pulling back for no reasons besides hedge funds needing to cash out to show their quarter to quarter profit to their clients.
Aren't classes separated? Equity guys do equity, and bondsman stick to fixed-income? Or are these funds owned by the bank?
owned by the bank
Ah, strong 🐭 bull sentiment in here. Never felt better about my puts. **Always** inverse WSB
I considered it, way too much confidence from the bulls on this one
The market will go down in flames
I'm in on the same bet.
I wanna see that straight line down to hell on AFRM after close
DASH as well
DASH isn’t tanking I use that shit once a week.
The only redeeming factor to this garbage day is tasting the salty tears of TSLA bears.
It hit 988 this morning.  Sold my puts at 990, and added calls 1001.
That’s why your dad left you

Jpow gonna lose his job and a hawk will come in. Dems don’t care about crashing stock market a bit Bc most of their voters arnt rich. Dems would rather crash the stock market and crush inflation then continue with this
probably best to address inflation? Acting like you can't just buy puts. Be a patriot
Exactly. Biden’s approval ratings are cratering.
Probably because not even the dems like him.
They are not wrong.
Feds should have tightened rates 8 months ago. We let this go another two years without hawkish policies and we'll be dealing with Weimar Republic levels of hyper-inflation
There donor are rich though and they will prop it up just as they are told to do so.

That pipeline wasn’t functional yet. Still under construction for at least another year+ likely longer. Unrelated issue, stop parroting propaganda nonsense.
[deleted]
My comment was that the specific pipeline “he stopped” was not the cause. Some of your other notes do in fact have an effect on the price but they were absent from your original comment. The main reason gas prices are higher is due to increased demand from travel picking up and inflation, add to the fact that many companies are further increasing prices while having increased costs to recover lost profits from the shutdowns last year. 

Read this comment chain to yourself out loud. Now realize not only how terrible you are at managing your emotions, you’re also an idiot.
[deleted]
No, that singular pipeline isn’t responsible for any part of it. It’s 1 of several hundred and there was no change in how that oil was being transported (rail and tanker) since it was nowhere near completion. Putting some blame on Biden is different then pretending 1 unfinished pipeline has any noticeable effect at this point in time. Other policy related and economic related issues are the cause. The pipeline was just a tangible thing that could be shared and talked about for the ignorant general public to attach an idea to.

Is it easier to teach a moron supply/demand/transitioning resources, profit margins, or to say pipeline cancel bad no easy oil moving?

I have a sweet family dog. She’s classified as a “pointer” for dog breeds. 

Whenever there is a opossum in the back yard though…she instantly chases it down and a kills it. This morning she’s killed again. In 3 years of life she’s killed 3x opossums 2x squirrels and 1x blue jay and thats just what I know of. I think opossums are the easiest because they just freeze when confronted the stupid fucks. The dog also opens doors (we have lever style knobs).

PLTR back to $26 eow
Most pointer breeds are useless for chase and kill. Got yourself a real Renaissance dog there bud
:(
Opossums are the ugliest sumbitches you’ll ever see. Good doggo.

DASH is a head scratcher. Terrible service nobody in the US likes. Mediocre earnings report (increased YoY loss but rev beat), and 8B acquisition using their own stock. How did they pop after hours like that?! I understand the Wolt acquisition gets them into Europe cheaper than they would have been able to on their own but that after hours pop makes no sense to me.
I don’t think you realize how pervasive Wolt is in Europe. Saw it all over last month. Literally over half the delivery mopeds are Wolt.

Things being outside of expectations is bad for stocks
Inflation bad because advances rate hike timeline, when did you think that narrative changed?
When S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq hit all-time-highs?
What’s the smart investing move when inflation is high?
Boomer shit
Smart investing?  Wrong sub for that.

Commercial real estate with short lease terms and lots of low fixed debt
Own equities.
Bank deposit in currency with low inflation
Supposed to be industrials, but anytime inflation is high the market sells off any inflation hedges because “that must mean the fed will get inflation under control soon”
Industries with pricing power because no matter what people need to pay: energy, real estate, raw materials. Companies that do business multinationally and in other less inflationary currencies.

Its similar to bacon, usually you get thin slices. Its lsmoked and made with sugar and spices. Its tough to describe, you gotra try it for yourself
Do jersey bagel places usually got this? I need to try
You can get this at like any breakfast place in nj lol

you're still dumb for holding cash while inflation is at its highest point in 30 years lol
!remindme 6 months
remind you of what? even if there's a correction, you'd have to also calculate lost gains from sitting outside of the bull run. the market losing greater value than the rate of inflation won't tell the full story of how much wealth you've lost from sitting on the sidelines for however long you've been.

"Transitory" won't matter when inflation erodes consumer purchasing power and rates increase, diminishing people's ability to use debt to pay for their lifestyles. Prices won't go down.

Anyone who bought NVDA at 300+ is my kind of retard
gold going for 1900, huge signal to the market.
Time for a bloody day
If youre buying companies with above a 10p/s ratio you’re gonna have a bad time the next year with rates increasing
Ford weeklies at open? The 12% of Rivian they own is going to be worth like $7 or 8 billion dollars after the IPO. Might be a play in the sea of red.
Was thinking of doing that too
Seems to have gotten priced in last week but who knows.
There was a lot of news for it this week. Debt repurchase, green bonds, etc.  Not sure how much the IPO is in play.

Thanks HYLN, I was having too good a month and needed something to shit all over me and throw me into a depression
Dip is being bought quickly

God man. You need to become smarter. I believe in you. You can understand context clues, I know it.
Lol fuck me
TSLA is really gonna carry this market on its coattails isn't it.

What simulation is this reality.
Elon right now: Gaslight, Gatekeep, Girlboss 💅💅💅
Oh this is far better than I was preparing for.
Opened SPY 450p 11/29 as hedge
#ELY record earnings and raised guidance. I’d buy long term. 

Supply getting better and the company raised guidance. Top golf dates before you take her home for a good fuck session. 

Not the 40% overnight after hour type play. It’s a wait 6 months, earn 30-40% type play. Easy money. So undervalued
Tesla said SIKE
#all imma say is $ELY is a winner. Record earnings during a pandemic during supply chain issues and beat estimates and raised guidance. The triple 3 that are all positive.
Calls gonna print in the coming days I love ELY
I like it. I dont normally do this but ill hold it long term
I've got some calls that are 9DTE $2 OTM
Who could have predicted messing with a Chinese crap-toe mining ticker would bite me in the ass?

Hello! Booked profits at open. Will buy puts again shortly.
Same. Open was beautiful.

SPY is like welfare at this point. Free money for everyone. Sit back and collect your checks.
JpOW just called  me, he has cancelled the recession for this year. Paaaaaamp it!!
Bear fucker! Do you need assistance??!
Sell your assets for cash because inflation is scary. Lmfao
They can at least say transfer it to gold/crypto as a hedge but nope just turn it into cash
But but but bond yields are rising! Lol holding equities is literally the go to strategy to hedge against inflation.

God. Have to wait til after the next split.
Nope, give it a few months

Imagine buying puts on TSLA after it was already down almost 20% in a two day span.

What could possibly go wrong

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Go tesla go🔥🔥
TSLA bears right now buying SPY calls to save their portfolio, pretending it’s not just a proxy for buying TSLA calls 🤡🤡🤡
The TSLA call is too damn high.

TSLA needs to do a 4:1 split.
I too am poor
TSLA making that vacation money 🤑
If Rivian doesn’t collapse immediately down from $120, this market makes no sense.
Have u ever heard of tesla?
Fair, fair lol.
To be fair..same as ocugen..not 1 sale of anything yet that company made me so much money it's honestly stupid.
US 10 Year is going to keep going up now


The bond market is signaling that inflation is real.

The stock market is shrugging it off, as if they think inflation will subside 

Who is right?
Everyone but cash gang, they “r fuk” bigly.
Historically, the bond market is usually correct but early
I'm probably dumb and don't understand it right, but if interest rates are rising on the 10 year, don't that mean people are selling them? If they sellin em, where put money? Put money in stock market because it might keep up with inflation?
This is annoying conspiracy crap but seriously the way this shit moves sometimes relative to news and expiration dates is hilarious, the most rigged thing I've ever seen in my life
MM got to make their money
I have a feeling that F dumps when rivn opens up. Or it could be that Taco Bell I ate for breakfast

Yes
JPOW AND RIVN

Moon mission confirmed!!!!🐓🐓🐓🚀
What about Jpow bby?
Rivn open at 200. You know you want to
Rivian open at 1200
The board probably told Elon that he needs to demonstrate TSLA has support at this level before they will approve a split. Be expecting a split announced early next week after the stock closes at 1200+
It’s looking like today was the last chance for tesla under 1k… before the stock split that is.

COIN is legit on crack rn

Bill Gates would be worth $1.2 Trillion if he held onto his Microsoft shares. Instead, he became friends with Warren Buffett and decided to diversify his portfolio. He is now worth $138 Billion

#TRANSITORY
Ford going to $18.50 today. Book it.
Ban bet
I’m bullish on Ford but I could see a pullback if Rivian ends up going $50 or under today.
People should be getting jacked to the tits on Rivian puts.  $78B valuation that basically makes it equal to Ford? GTFO with this bullshit.  It shouldn't even be 1/4th the value.
Are options available today?
Soon. not yet.
Aren’t they available 2 weeks after the IPO?
> I'm not sure if they're available for purchase yet.
Is that an hourly uptrend on Tilray I see? 🧐

No. Imbalances are like a clock that doesn't tell time. And it is lunch so I doubt MMs will hold it
Your fucking will begin at 1:20 EST

F for those who fell for TSLA bull trap.
SPY 12/10 $468c gonna be okay?
$F down b/c rumor it won't be selling Rivian shares soon.
>rumor it won't be selling Rivian shares soon.

It can't sell its shares soon.  They are locked up like all the other early investors.

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=1179785-100585

The lockup is 180 days (6 months)
Curious as to why its a discussion topic on CNBC if the answer is so clear...
Because it draws eyes and controversy for ratings.  Otherwise Ford would have to find some sort of buyer for a prearranged purchase 180 days out at an unjustified price, and there won't be any takers.
There is a lock-up period of 180 days.
We're going to close in green boys 🚀🚀🚀

Really tempted to buy AMD now that it has returned a little bit more towards reasonable.
The money printer is having a hiccup like it does every now and again. Growth been bonkers for years. I’m really curious what this place would look like in a bear market.
Like the good 'ol days of loss porn.
A historic bull market hasn’t even protected these kings from incredible loss porn. I can’t imagine what it could become.
$MRK might acquire $SAVA
Lol okay. Source?

Another $500 down the drain this week boyssss unless AMD moons

Holy fuck this is worse than getting gaped, I've two buttholes now. Fucking fuck.

Finally some good fuckin red candles. Delicious
Good time to buy some AMD shares?

Yeah same. Lost 15k over 2 weeks from tesla and spy now. Tbh shit is not looking good to keep the bill market going

Were gonna fix this inflation

This is just a trap institutions are using to shake out the weak hands like the people bitching on here. You are selling for a loss and it'll continue climbing in a few days.
Doesn't work when people continuously buy weekly calls. They get wiped out on days like today
It’s over…everything is over…salvage what you can now or experience worst pain of yo life

Liquidated all my AMD, took a $10k loss. Now watch it bounce back to 150 by EOW
I'm still long on NVDA and AMD both. Demand for graphics cards is only gonna get higher and nobody else makes them. Literally can't go tits up
is amc at 0 yet
The latest security breach is the final nail in the coffin for HOOD. God I love that app, but their management is poop.
The app is so much easier to use than TOS or TDA, but the company sucks ass. Just waiting for a good opportunity to transfer, but I probably need to liquidate some options so they aren't stuck in limbo when I do.
Yea man, there’s never a perfect time to transfer but you gotta do what you gotta do man. The fact that the Bulgarian kid still hasn’t addressed the breach seems sketchy.
Even when I invest in a solid company I still lose money 😂
I think I should give up on this. I’m up 10% in the last 15 months - think index funds are for me
$SPY to 300 by January
I believe the phrase is banbet
!banbet PLTR $28 2w
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/International_Mud741** bet **PLTR** goes from **22.4** to **28.0** before **2021-11-24 15:20:29.594235-05:00**
good time to buy? I've been looking at getting into PLTR for a while but its absolutely drilling rn with no sign of stopping
It’s a slow burn investment for me. I like the company and what they do. Finances are pretty solid.
I like the company too - big data is the future. I made a rule not to buy into WSB plays unless I'm super early after getting burned a couple times, but PLTR feels like a company I'd invest in without WSB talking about it so I'm torn.
Let’s just be honest, MFs about to buy like crazy.
Bull trap or what
What yall doing? Holding and buying more or cutting losses? (paper handing)
Mostly paper handing
Buying the dip. Market is still on easy mode don’t overthink it
SPY 500 Jan on sale!
I just doubled down on my $490 Jan
LOLOLOL
At least be realistic and get 480
Going all in on $461 and $460 SPY puts expiring in 1 month. EVERY single major company had bad earnings, every single month the CPI data is getting worse. And now the evergrande shit show again??
Damn Mr Market I already sucked your cock and you gaped me… what else do you want?
Next, Mr market wants to shit in your mouth.
jokes on him...
apparently all the major banks are connected to Evergrande somehow? Lehmans v2.0?.

 cash gang for the rest of the week.
My downstairs neighbor is blasting the song Closing Time

We still got 33 minutes honey
ofc paper handed my tsla calls on that dip
Mr musk said fuck yo bers in the butthole
PROG has really good earnings prob gonna see a +20%
I hope, ready for this to moon!
I’d buy options if not for that astronomical IV

What was the move?
SPY puts I bought yesterday. And loaded up on VXX calls this morning. 

I'm day trade banned for 3 months now but I had to lock this in
If it's your first time, you can ask to have it lifted.
Not my first time unfortunately. Worth the ban to lock in these gains.
This was me yesterday. 

Guess what happened today.
I'm withdrawing 2k once the funds settle not fucking around
Holding spy puts for this week, buying spy call eow
cant tell which is worse holding, Clovtards or Wishtards
Clov… I’ve been bag holding for months just trying to get out even and averaging down. The CLOV subreddit is filled with delusion and people talking about it going to$ 100 a share when all are clearly bag holders trying to get out
I got downvoted for saying how shitty wish is as e-commerce platform
its basically ebay for rejected merchants from alibaba
Yes and it is at the mercy of inflation and supply chain issues.
We need another infra bill like right fuking now. Idc wut the fuk we building. And that sleepy fuk better not fire JPow
WISH going below $5 AH
Circuit breaker day tomorrow, load up puts
Funniest shit i read
The mouse is gonna get rekt, I think
Bears need to stop trying to scare retail and convert to bulls. Everyone around the world is buying US stocks, real estate and starting businesses here. You got all the innovative trillion dollar companies in the US too. Every dip is being bought.
Bought a bunch of SPY 454p this morning at open like an idiot and it blasted to 457. Ended up selling an hour ago when it dipped down to 462.10. Stressful ass day.
#AFFIRM TIME
I have prog calls, wish puts, and afrm puts. If none of those go my way then I’m going to bury myself
Godspeed, you autist
RIVIAN $100MM valuation for two models that are at least  67k and nothing on the road yet … I need to take some more Ivermectin for this to make sense …
'When the market is crazy, go crazy for a while..you might like it'- Chinese Buffet
$TSLA valuation makes no sense either. Nothing does anymore.
But TSLA has a CEO that hosted SNL and memes!
True. It's Elon's market now.
TSLA valuation makes sense because of its valuation. Not only do they have a chance of complete EV market dominance, but their valuation means they can literally sell 1% of their shares and open five more manufacturing plants. Even if they fell 50% tomorrow people would just buy twice as many shares.

Hence IMO If and when TSLA is seen as overvalued by EVERYONE it’s just going to trade sideways-ish for two years and go on another historic bull run.
Really hope TSLA gaps up hard today. I'm not playing it, but I'm getting super hard thinking of the loss porn from the greedy bears who STILL held after 20% drop in a few days
BULS R FUK
Oh my god it’s really gonna go green by open you cannot make this shit up - fuck inflation - this is STAGFLATION baby
do you know the definition of stagflation lmao
He must think it’s like a stag party or something. “Antlerflation, hella pointy”
swagflation
This is going to be lost on some people but I want you to know I appreciate it
Yes dawg we are getting the quadfecta, relatively high unemployment, astounding inflation, stonks go up on fucking no news or bad news, and GDP falling over the last 6 months
payrolls are being added and unemployment is falling though

GDP growth will recover, supply chain bottlenecks are the issue
I’m by no means a doomer, this shit will pass sometime. But over the past 6 months this shit is textbook stagflation, you can’t hit someone with dO yOu KnOw tHe DeFiNiTiOn just because you disagree
stagflation: persistent high inflation combined with high unemployment and **stagnant demand** in a country's economy

demand is absolutely not stagnant and hasn't been, that's kind of the point of it all right now, demand is outpacing supply. get a different textbook.
I’m sorry you woke up and felt the need to argue. May your portfolio be blessed with green. And also, suck my fucking textbook you god damn nerd you’re wrong
It means the inflation is going on a bachelor’s weekend with his best buddies 🥰
6 percent inflation drives everybody to stock market 🚀🚀 everything rally starts soon
I’d say 100% chance Tesla is green today
This wasn’t JPOW’s fault alone. We overdid it on the stimulus payments and ue checks.
I don't think a few thousand here and there to the poors matter that much. But that's just me.
When the poors can collectively afford more than they could before without working, what happens? Deflation?
> Yes.
The money that went to the popes was a sliver. The majority went to the corps and they are all having record profits again.
And they are trying to spend more without any real solutions to fix the supply chain problems and energy shortage lol
Real shit
Ya think?

I make almost twice as much money as I did before the pandemic and they're still sending me checks.
>*we*

I didn't give out stimulus payment.
Oh
I’ll do legit anything for Amd and nvda to go green today. Anything
Ive got puts tho
Its over. U lost
Honestly the Fed is trapped, raising interest rate in this fragile economy would almost guarantee a recession or even depression, not raising it then inflation can keep running higher. The only effective way is to solve the supply chain bottlenecks and energy and chip shortages, which is out of the Fed’s control.
Mother fucking son of a bitch cunt ass mother fucking bitch ass fucking son of a bitch mother fuck. Fuck GME and options mother fuck
Yep I feel like this everyday now
I mean how long are we gonna get fucked?
3 days so far shits gotta start going up eventually shits already priced in elon fucked everything up honestly
I took 300 turned it into 4K in 3 days and it only took me 3 days to loose it all
Yeah bro I feel you same boat I hate days like these because you can spend a week getting from a couple hundred to several thousand and then you can just lose everything on one or a couple red days. Shits ridiculous
Yeah I’m sick of it, but fuck it’s nice when you hit
Only way to play options on GME is probably CSP's.
Yeah if you’re suicidal
It's worked out pretty well for me when I assume support at $170. Sometimes buying occasional calls works out for a IV play as well.
TSLA up $40 within 10 minutes, to the 🌝!

I believe it pumped a little bit in AH. Is that what you’re seeing?
Probably YF show me +0,25 pre market
Could be a huge red day for semiconductors. Whales gonna scramble to rotate out before a big profit-taking selloff, causing a big profit-taking selloff.
My semiconductor puts already printing on european market
i learned something yesterday. i learned that options arent for me. so today, im buying this nvidia dip. jist buying stock straight up because this company will be double in the next couple years
Just get options like 4 months out, attention span of the market and traders is about 5 minutes.
This. I didn’t start consistently making money on options until I started buy longer dated expiries. Sure you can make stupid gains with short term options, but at least in my case there are plenty of stupid losses mixed in that negate the gains.
Yeah and earnings are next week so it'll probably run up.
NVDA HASN'T DIPPED YET

Pltr a good buy now?
Never a good buy, avoid at all costs
Always a buy!
Lmao
Karp the only one making money
No and it’s downgraded
Last chance to buy TSLA at low 1000
🙃
I don’t know? Green at open then red me thinks
Literally spy calls at open
TSLA’s pump is faker than my gf’s orgasms
Dont worry, her real boyfriends taking care of that
Banks predict a higher inflation print, they are apparently going to be wrong
When does that report come out

We’re bullish right!? Right!?
Already lost 70% on my Amd calls. Please tell me I’m ok guys. They’re weeklies btw
You are golden, bro. Don't even sweat it.
 Rrrrekt
I need this thing to limit down so my puts can print 🥺
SPY 455 incoming soon
Anyone else buying the Upst dip?
Wtf happened?
Why is it going down? It makes no sense to me
Nvda really down 5% right now what the flying fuck
It went up like 20% in a week lol
It was up like 80% in the last month 🤡
It’s STILL up 42% in the last month, what did you expect?
I wouldn't buy it unless it's down 50%.
What's the most overpriced shit out here right now? TSLA, NET?
Lucid rivian
TSLA in terms of market cap. GME in terms of %
NET, DASH, NKLA, and Rivian. Tesla is a proxy for other stuff like Starlink, SpaceX, and Elon Musk in general

Any apes get IPO shares of RIVN???
I got 18 of the 40 I requested through sofi.
Still waiting to hear from E-Trade.....
Bummer
I got 7 out of the requested 100 shares. Something is better than nothing I guess
Damn, yeah. I had the thought of requesting more than I could actually afford incase something like this happened. Should have done it lol oh well.
Today is the lowest price you’ll ever get for rivian. Better get it now before it’s 800
Prob won’t even be available to trade till 1pm
tsla 1150 eod!!!
EOL (End of Lunch)
you crazy bastard i love it
Got 1 RIVN share for 79 bucks

TSLA really is the meme stock that just won't die, huh?
TSLA bears ded
I just bought $2k in SPY Jan puts , but am torn if I should buy the new COD for $70 or not....
Literally about to do this same thing.
How are those spy puts doing? 😂😂
Ask me in 45 minutes
so cocky. I added  more a few minutes ago
Lolololol inflation was at 6.2% in October. Highest in 31 years. RIP!!!
Inflation pumps the market FYI
Bruh the markets been artificially pumping since March last year. Even before the first stimmy checks went out.
Clearly
TSLA dip was easiest money ever made
what if you bought at -6% yesterday like dozens of people here?  Faster money down the drain ever?
Here comes the rug pull boys lol
BanBet! RIVN $100 EOD

Stock market a big meany for not letting rivian come out and play
Just went all in into pltr
Rip
Pltr always goes back to 30
So legit question.. I'm holding SPY 12/6 467c and 12/8 475c since last week. Am I just throwing my money away at this point?
Ape hold strong.
Probably it's on a correction of about 4%. So yeah it's gonna go down before up.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Only if you close those positions now
No
No, I’m holding similar calls, can’t have daily all time highs forever, market corrects and then goes on another run for EOY. you’re good
[deleted]
Welp. panic sold my F calls.   You should all win now.
Holding this TSLA put is kinda turning me on to other guys ngl
If anyone you know has a hard time with delayed gratification, introduce them to options.
Where are all the idiots that said SPY was going to 🚀 this week?
I wasn't one of them but it still can lol
ummm. No.
Rivian let’s go
There will be a $0.05 cent charge for each bag you leave with today
Bull r destroyed
How is spy not -1% already!
Because you touch yourself too much to stonk gore.
Rivian called the top
So the new overvalued EV stock crashed the market huh?
Shocker
Can we all just pump one stock so we can see green.
I vote lcid
thats market manipulation silly goose
Goddammit man your a genius
I dunno about you queers but I'm making money today.
Last 2 days have been epic for me - I went bear last week and was getting worried
$LCID NASTY REVERSAL OFF $40. GOING TO HIT $50 BY END OF THE WEEK.

Tomorrow green AF.

Bro RS5 come on
We're literally about to have the craziest close of the week, which will then kick off the Christmas rally. This pullback is a gift!!
All in on SOFI, earnings in in 1 hour, this dip is bullshit.
I earned $31K on the last Tesla fall. I'm going to short it again now.
I'd be careful. That last crash was pretty much guaranteed after the Elon tweet, but TSLA has a huge amount of support at 1000$. I don't see it going above 1100$ in the next few days either but there's nothing to indicate its gonna keep drilling like yesterday
TSLA skybound tomorrow
Time to watch SoFi get SLAUGHTERED here soon

Inflation is the result of QE and low rates... that happened under trumps admin.

The fed is Apolitical in theory though, but their hand was forced due to the pandemic, which is where you can sort of blame this all back to that admin. Covid response in late jan/early feb was massively limp dick. They helped precipitate the need to cause high inflation. But without that, hardly anyone in here would've made money. 

Bidens been pretty limp dick about putting pressure on OPEC for more oil though.
$tsla going under 1k 😂
Damn it feels good to be a gay bear
they say highest inflation since 1990. You know what happened between 1990-2000?

Biggest fucking bull run in tech, We are only at the beginning people, stay in the market and get filthy rich.

So did elon

I blame Biden.
I blame JPOW but ok
I do not understand how Hertz is so fucked since it got connected with tesla. It just seems to follow the course of TSLA, or am I wrong? Fake pump off-market with Tesla, the same thing happens with Hertz. Any ideas?
Elon explained everything on Twitter, he even warned investors before sell off, You are just too dumb living in a bubble where stocks go +50% each month
You are honestly the most retarded person on here. Elon posted that tweet in order to not get hate from the community. He knew people would vote yes on his poll. Literally, the day before the tweet Elon's brother sold around 100 mil worth of TSLA. Besides, selling 2.5% of the total market cap can go through one transaction at this pace, meaning that his order is not fulfilled. This is just people selling of due to the tweet. I usually do not invest in such volatile stocks but as I bought Hertz at its initial IPO I am invested within this situation.
Sucks

If they make you lose all your money we have problems money can't fix
Boomer Answer: VNQ (REIT ETF). Not that far away from pre-COVID highs. Commercial real estate can have rent bumps tied to inflation. If you wanna be specific on the sector/property type, residential in particular have no problem raising rents on tenants from year to year (rents up like double digit % year over year).
Buy Uranium stock for long term
SP500 equity. I keep my savings there. It’s always going to beat inflation year on year. If it’s not urgent money, it will recover from any major dips or corrections, and you’ll average 10-12% yearly.

Honestly, we don't really have a timeline in mind. I would like to put our savings to work so, at the bare minimum, it isn't losing value. But, it would be nice to have it easily accessible (or able to be borrowed against) if an emergency arises

If Rivian doesn’t have a higher market cap than Ford and GM the market is broken.

It's 2040. PLTR has used its blackbox technologies combined with access to government data collecting to exert influence in worldwide events.

Coz clones here love trash🤡
For the love of God don't chase Rivian. That's a bubble we can't feed. They haven't proven themselves. Underwriters are trying to capitalize on FOMO, expecting they'll be viewed as the next Tesla.
They have 100,000 van order and a massive investment from Big Daddy Bezos and Ford.

Rivian is the first legit EV IPO. I agree that Lucid and Nikola are meme bullshit, but I am not betting against the amount of money Amazon and Ford have in Rivian.
That in no way justifies their valuation
It doesn't. None of the EV maker valuations are real. Tesla is the most overpriced company in the universe. Lucid and Nikola are memes. I'm just saying that if any of them deserve a higher valuation, it's the one that is tied to major players and has big orders already.

I am heavily into traditional automaker shares and leaps because I expect all of these EV-only growth stocks to get gutted by electric F150s, Hummers, etc.
Meh. I get your arguement though.
I understand your position entirely. I hate investing in companies when their fundamentals are bullshit, but at some point you can make some money betting on the cultists pumping things up.
Right. The thing is I don't want anyone getting burned.
This is a sub full of idiots who couldn't be talked out of buying Gamestonk and a movie theatre during COVID at their peaks. I wouldn't sweat it.
It’s a total screw job, and fools will buy into it. Come here and bitch and wine about it,rope about it, on and on….
Can tsla fucking take a shit already...wtf
You don't bet against Tesla, ya nub!

So can AMD go green?
Spy choose a side plz
It did. Look at the RSI for the past 4 days.
When does rivian ipo? Will that make ford go up?
am i really getting IV crushed on RIOT calls as buttcorn made new ATH this morning??
> What's an IV?
I was allocated 30 out of the 200 requested RIVN shares. Anyone get their full request filled?
At what price
I got all of the 175 I requested
I got 50% of my request.  My order was was 10 shares and got 5.
sophie is gonna get wrecked without bank charter news
She is fully bent over at this point
ok, open TSLA puts now at 1069.8
Instantly underwater
according to cnbc, jeff amazon delayed US moon landing by a year because of the lawsuits. 

get fucked jeff (and split the stock)
No wonder why people buy LEAPS , I'm up 55% on my DISCA Jan 2023 leaps
Is it possible for Rivian to merge with Ford or anything like that?
Nope,Ford is getting out after making EV perfection. They are after the  EV F-150 . Ford is a win win
F150 lightning is going to be such a massive hit.
Not if Rivian has any sense. As of right now, before even trading, they are worth more that the total of Ford. Also Amazon owns about 20% of Rivian so I doubt they would allow that to happen.
Ford owns like 12% of Rivian though don’t they?
Yep, now imagine if Ford wants to buy Rivian they would have to out up Billions, when they are already billions in debt, just to get Amazon's shares.
Unless the bubble pops and Ford can scoop them up at a discount. 

They still haven’t proved they can provide volume like Tesla.
NEGG YOU BITCH DO $50
Absolutely fucking me rn
Days like today, you just add more to your QQQ positions. HODL♾♾
On a -.3% yeah lol okay
I wish all BNTX bulls a very pleasant evening
I have a simple question for you apes:

If you're playing DIS, what are you playing?
Well I have calls for earnings so you may want to buy puts
very important to pile into tech growth names after a hot CPI
Hot CPI means higher rates coming sooner, higher rates means the future value of tech stocks is lower.

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Utopia_Bot (0/1) made a bet that CRSR would go to 27.1975 when it was 24.725 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Safe Haven during anything: $ELY
I expected a bigger move today i had the 31c and that shits down like 15%
Dw wait 2-3 months. I’m expecting it to gap close to 40s
dayum, was that a beautiful bull trap or what
RIOT so undervalued if you compare it to MARA.
Management is unknown
Yea riot also diluted the shit out of their stock
I would love to see just for once retail not buy into the hype and send the price of this IPO into the 🚽 crapper
Prog anyone?
Holding $3.50 puts through earnings
prog deez nuts
don’t know if i should jump on now or after earnings, every stock yesterday tanked after their earnings reports
Been scraping Benjamins off prog calls for weeks. She’s a big winner
Thinking about calls a dollar up. Looks like it will beat
Tesla making that candy cane shape, is Christmas coming early?
I rly wanna go all in on sofi puts
Name a strike and I’ll join and we can be 🤡 together

Holy fuck 😳 has anyone looked at CHEGG recently? God damn lol…

Did I miss something with Poshmark? Down a healthy 31% for no good raison 🍇 wtf
Ever hear of earnings?
Yes, when good companies smash earnings they dip. When shit companies have shit earnings they moon.

Posh is a way overvalued company that had bad earnings and it dropped.

Where do you think Posh falls on your dipole scale?
Are you trying to tell me that investing in a clothing reselling company for shitty blouses is not going to make me rich?

Above I was being sarcasm. Posh is probably going to go under now that covid isn’t a thing in the west anymore

Every growth stock getting hammered on inflation news
You don't know what crush means , everything inline and growth slowed down.
"crushes"
Okay guys. Got a meeting. These TSLA put FDs better print while I’m in there. Sell everything quick so we drill more there. Ty
Valuations mattered when it was just the big boys playing the market. Now every retard on the shitter can buy in, the old ways of viewing companies has gone by the wayside. Place your bets accordingly.
this is literally what they have said at the top of every bubble for 300 years
Ford gonna go back up please?
Puts go BRRR 🥶
did BYND kill someone with one of their shitty burgers? Lol
Can someone ask burry on Twitter how much he's down on his short positions? He blocked me awhile back. 

Thanks in advance
Today is not that day
He's still gotta be waaaay down, especially on his tesla short
Cautiously optimistic
To the depths of hell is where the bulls are going
if the market is green tomorrow F 20s are a steal
I agree but timing is sounds hard. It could crash till next week.
wall street BETS
wen bounce
The dip dipped but I got no chips to put the dip on cuz when the dip only dip I used all my chips. Ya feel?
This year’s 38th recession is a doozy.. All in favor of rescinding day lights saving time to put us closer to the bell raise your hand.
I am down so bad PLEASE POWER HOUR
Ok spy I’m gonna need a huge green dildo at power hour
Lol GL
Remember when wish was 15 and everyone was pumping it? How the times have changed
I hope yall know spy going to 436 within a week or so. If we keep closing in the red we could possibly see 430 lmaooo this shit is getting spooky rn
Spy we really need that power hour soon

Tsla bull trap 95% complete, 30m left and 🔻🔻🔻
I tried to warn them this morning. That shit up 5% was a joke. Inflation and bond yields + strong down momentum yesterday into close.
Love when 9 out of the 11 companies I have puts on are printing. Feels almost as euphoric as watching the same greedy degenerate permabulls who called me a gay bear for actually hedging or even daring to comment about how it’s impossible for the bull run to continue with inflation, labor shortages and supply chain issues getting worst every week now begging for the pain to stop. Couldn’t happen to a more deserving group of people. Cry more.
They need to suffer
Why everything die?
I think tomorrow put holders are gonna cry.
why is the market taking a crap...
Inflation worse than expected
Puts still have runway

U can still chop ur bull dick and be a gay bear

Registration for bear club is free!!

Limit slots! Join nowww
It’s not too late to save yourselves bulls
Bought puts for the first time I feel ashamed
well I'm ashamed because I sold my QQQ puts when NASDAQ was at -1%. My calls could still use hedging after all, and I'm naked now.

NASDAQ went even further down to -1.70%, as we all saw
PORTFOLIO HARASSMENT!!!
zoom out you whiny bitches ☠️
CLOSE THE CASINO
Is there a reason pretty much everything is bleeding? Genuine question

Inflation Numbers and china

We close 459
Sold SoFi and a few meme stocks I was playing and went cash gang this morning. 

Best decision I've made for the last month.
Go do some window shopping
Nah, taking a long weekend and gonna fly up to Chicago for a few days. I was able to make a lot of gains with 🥭 and booked a super bougie hotel and first class flights. 

Gonna see how the other side lives for a few days before I come back and start working behind the Wendy's next week.
This is a minor drop man, you should have never been in the market.
Kk
Tesla still green. Market wants blood.
Red
imagine buying IPO of a car company that loses billions and wont deliver a vehicle for 2 years
Sounds like Tesla back in the day
tesla wasnt valued as the 2nd most valuable car company
It’s been grossly overvalued for years without Amazon. So whatevs
Imagine the NKLA buyers at $60
Highly bullish.it should worth at least 500b
Tsla joining the party
# TSLA DUMPING NOW
Is this market wide dump from the CPI? If the dollar is worth less then the dollar value of stonks should go up /s
Baba holding strong, why are all you Mericans shitting your pants and paper handing, be more Chinese
459 please fucker
I don’t get this place. Im a semi new gay bear and seeing everyone freak out about the past two days like what? I’ve been getting brutally ass fucked the past 2 weeks this isn’t shit
you're clearly not leveraged enough
I’ve been holding these spy and f dec calls for a week and now I’m shitting water.
Hope y’all bought the dip power hour is gonna be a doozy
sorry guys, i failed nnn
Oh shit, I'm up about 2K on the WISH puts I bought. I could sell now, but this is my first taste of red money and I fucking want blood
At least my Tesla put that I bought today went up
Where the hell is ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)

Bloomberg talking about a bond yield spike.

Y’all hoes know what that means. Time to be 🌈 for a few weeks.
Fart noises intensity
someone hold me and tell me it'll be ok
It's over folks, Elon and the fed are selling. We are fucked
It seems you all don't understand what happened today.

So, Evergrande defaulted on a payment....again....so a German bond company has filed bankruptcy proceedings against Evergrande......

I mean, You can literally pinpoint when it happened if you took every stock ticker and overlayed them.
It lagged for stocks news came out but didn’t react quickly
but they just made 2 payments like 10mins ago
So what happens next?
So big green tomorrow
Lol, I hope so
do you mean this [http://www.dmsa-agentur.de/download/20211110\_DMSA\_EVG\_PM\_en.pdf](http://www.dmsa-agentur.de/download/20211110_DMSA_EVG_PM_en.pdf) who the fuck are those guys? seems some kinda gay bear propaganda agency lol.
Someone bought Evergrandes bonds expecting interest payments, Didn't get them, Bankruptcy proceeding filed by creditors.

Call it propaganda all you want.

 But China just shit the bed not paying their debts.
Real rates at all-time lows. Shit is looking GRIM
TLT puts? TBT calls?
oh man. TLT puts if I had to pick one but the bond market is not for retards to play in
Ok bud
rates track growth expectations. which means growth outlook is dismal, even with high inflation. your lesson for today
Puts on Tesla
Put on your rally caps mutha fuckers!
Damn people still didn’t learn their lesson on tsla? This shit will drop 10% on your head in any given second….
Didn't Evergrande lie about making its last payments? Yeah ok, ain't buying that shit this time
This just in! Evergrande actually paid everything off haha! Recession canceled! Buy our useless stocks! Haha!
I couldn't draw a better example of a bear flag if I tried
Damn my Spy calls doing good on this bounce will hold till Friday $470 target
**BOLD**
Damn that’s your target for your portfolio value on Friday? Nice.
Who else bought ~~SOFI~~ SoFukt because of wsb?

Y'all really wanna see me homeless huh?
😔
Time to shove some gold up my ass, load my shotgun and go into the bunker.

See you when SPY hits 200.
UVXY is only up 4%

What is this a crash for ants
This isn't a regular sell-off.. it's been in the making
And it's "making" me cranky
I can fix that if you want 😏
Lolol
Damn went from 120% up on TSLA puts to break even lol. I’m out and will be buying more if it starts to reverse
TSLA not playing 😂

Does anyone know why Wish's expected revenue for this q is nearly 50 percent less than last? Most of the other retailers reported similar earnings to their previous quarters. I know about Wish's problems, but still...
Facebook can’t spy on Apple users anymore so Wish can’t advertise effectively is my guess
But Wish main user base have android devices.
Let her go bro
bc they're spending $0 on advertising this Q
When is a good time to buy TSLA
2 years ago
300 Dollar
4 years ago
Anytime you want to buy, just buy for long enough
Whenever the rumored split happens
$BROS around $62 before earnings today is the lowest it will ever be for the foreseeable future. If there were ever a brand that had the chance to take major market share from Starbucks, it's this one. It's the equivalent of buying Chick-Fil-A stock in 1975 if they ever went public. Great opportunity.

Are you seriously saying that MSFT and AAPL should never dip? Lol. Relax buddy, it'll be up to ATH by December.
Come on, Rivian(RIVN) go to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀 Tesla(TSLA) needs a worthy competitor.
Lol make some vehicles first what a joke
backed by amazon and ford tho
$460 puts 11/12 not too bad
11/12 464 calls checking in 🤝
If you drive internal combustion engine you should own Tesla puts.
What about if I have a bus pass?
that's very smart and eco safe
So TSLA calls 1200 calls?
is inflation priced in yet or?..
Not even close. People are split into two camps: inflation will run away and kill us all, and inflation is transitory and you're a pussy if you think otherwise.
!banbet F 20 1Day
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
If you don't buy SPY calls right now that is pretty much anti 🇺🇲.   Terrorists get OUT
Might be dumb but I bought another F call
me too. i bought those calls this morning. FOMO got me one more time :(
267,000 jobless claims. 330,000,000 people in America. 

That’s 0.08% of the population…..but they keep telling us “nobody wants to work”
I love the narrative behind this. So stupid.
I see more and more every day that math and logic are very difficult for the majority of people
The labor pool isn’t 330 million people .
Those are new claims my dude
Gotta take kids and retirees out of population first.
Ok lets take out 200,000,000 people. 

267,000 out of 130,000,000 people is still only 0.2% of the population.
Yeah man, fucking babies and toddlers, they should be out on the field like the rest of us.
Bro take out 300,000,000 then….that’s still not even 1%
Those are just the people actively looking for work. The rest are sitting on their couches at home collecting welfare.
Dude even if you take out 300,000,000 people from that pool….

267,000 out of 30,000,000 is still not even 1% of the population.
Exactly. No one wants to work
“If you do what you love you’ll never work a day in your life.” 🙃🙃🙃
It’s at 2.2 mil Jobless I think
Drill team 6 about to rotate back to TSLA. My cousin told me. He said they were finished with all the other tech and it was time to drill TSLA again.
Just finished jacking off. RIVIAN to $200

That's the one!
It’s been printing bro
Get ready for that SPY rip incoming ! Edit: R.I.P
Trash market going green
Tsla back to 1200?
Lmao!  Bull trap like no body’s business.  After that CPI y’all are truly retarded to swing back in.
Where ya gonna put your money besides the market
In inflation assets and commodities.  Not in stocks up 2000%
Awww you think being up x% matters. Bless your heart
Just here to laugh at you degenerate permabulls who respond to facts and logic on here with gay bears are fucked and stocks only go up comments. Couldn’t think of anyone that deserves the gapping you’re about to continue receiving more then y’all. Spread ‘em
feels inferior around bulls
Sniffs bears asses?
Salty.
I’m down 1.5% today after being up 35% this year. You got me 🐻!
Tell me you have only been in the market the last 18 months when it’s been easier to make money in anytime in history during the biggest bull run ever and now you identify as a permabull and are proud of yourself without telling me all that. My 17 year old son is up $42,000 in the last 6 months so basically it’s so easy even kids are making money. Make sure you give a update on that portfolio 2 weeks from now though
DOORDASH TANKS AND I GET TENDIES I WILL DONATE IT
you could use doordash to distribute tendies to people.  the kind you can dip in BBQ sauce
Can't sleep RIVN got me up
Why. It wont start trading until like 12-1pm est, it will open at 90 will probably go over 100 and settle at 76 by next week
> I don't believe in that shit.
Still can't sleep
Looking forward to Ghana says goodbye meme for tesla bulls

Y’all have been saying that everyday and it just keeps dropping lower
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
imagine not buying tSLA at 1k support
Imagine catching more falling knives.

See any support on that daily chart?
you short TSLA again today,if so whats your price target? I closed my puts yesterday, looking for a good short entry price for today
Closed mine so I didn’t have overnight. I might buy an FD if it bounces a little this morning. Wouldn’t be surprised to see 950
same here i kinda regret not holding overnight. will watch out for a good entry to short again, target for gap close around 950-900ish. good luck for you today :)
I’d have been nervous all night if I had. Had a feeling it’d drop but my contracts were up to 50k and that’s too much risk when a tweet could change the story.
I’ll be buying at 200
Yeah this
I'm buying RIVN at $78

Most bestest deal for new tesla truck company
LCID to $50 EoW ?

Listen Buddy it’s Wednesday you really should have figured this shit out by now
You know the market doesn't open for another hour 20, right?
Cpi drops at 8:30 est
CPI
They were talking about cpi
He meant until inflation data you mong
You kiss your mother with that mouth??
That inflation is insane
People talk about the 10 year a lot but check out the 2 and 5 year. As people have recently realized inflation will last 2 years, then 5 years, these rates have rocketed. 10 year is next.

Then my TLT puts will print. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
By any chance, I might be able trade TSLA under $900 today? What do you think?
Very doubtful. Last I saw there’s a huge buy wall at 1k.
Tomorrow. 950 today I think.
Possible
I don’t think so,  he close maybe near mid day
Lol gold just dicked

Except spy. Spy don't give a fuck, somehow.
NVDA up 42% in the last month and you’re still freaking out. Jesus Christ.
Guys , COIN price fell but I see a lot of upgrades. What's going on?
🤣 that’s not a serious question, right?
Legit questions bro
Oh, sorry.  Yeah, you’ll see a lot of upgrades on these biggies, because fund managers have a ton invested and it’s in their best interest to keep that issue up.  They want to instill a level of confidence for retail and the market that the big house are still behind an issue.  Meanwhile, many can be selling into that recovery, and mitigate their losses.  Not all, but many do.  It’s kind of a bit like a macro level pump and dump….so to speak.
Thanks, bud. I appreciate it.

Same with PYPL 🚀
But don’t know about their bigger parterniship with PTON

And you missed the part where Amazon missed badly on their earnings? 

I’m loading a Put first thing
CNBC:

&#x200B;

"Treasury Yields JUMP after hot inflation data"

&#x200B;

Yo stop lying. shit moved .01% literally been watching it.
Yep… and yields went up because the price of the bonds went down… so who’s holding bonds?
When does Sofi post? If it tanks may be great time for leaps
AH
Ah ok… CNBC says pre
SoFI is gonna die today
Plz no![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
“Janet Yellen dismisses runaway inflation”

Lol, poors don’t drive the economy
> “I can’t believe Janet Yellen is still alive. She should have been killed by a gangster years ago.
Lmao!
Holy shit, chill bro
Yellen killed Tupac?
They literally do though.

&#x200B;

You seriously think the rich are out their doing all that spending?
> No. I think they're hoarding cash and waiting for the next big crash.
Good bot
Lol. It was sarcasm in response to the headline. Of course they have an impact
I got a beautiful reply from the bot so it was worth it
> I know. You're not poor, though
So our area of TX is one that Zillow and opendoor have been active in.  Home Prices went up legit 40% in 2021 alone.  Is this something that corrects?  We are trying to buy a house and it’s been brutal
[deleted]
My inlaws home in Chicago suburbs went up legit less than 10%
What goes up must come down. It’s like… bernouillis principle or newtons DD or some shit idk
Supply and demand. 

So if they are not gobbling inventory, and were a big part of the purchase volume, and supply finally out strips demand then it will come down. But it won’t be overnight.
I sold my (0 down program through a CU) condo for \~90% over what I paid for it in 2015. I was able to put 20% down with that equity on a much larger home in a slightly cheaper city. shit is nuts.
Sell everything buy Robux and Vbucks as a hedge thank me later
goin balls deep on rivn when they release it to the market
What y’all think the real inflation number is
50%
20%.  Just basing that on esoteric things no one consumes that are excluded from CPI, like housing, food and gasoline.
its so fucking rigged i cant standd it lolz
Inflation at 7% and TLT is going up wtffff
Why would that not happen?
All I'm gonna say about inflation is that if Brainard gets the nod for Fed Chair, buy all the corn you can.
Worlds gonna end if our savior, JPOW, is dethroned
Confirm that you actually know stuff. What expiration?
uh what?
I already 100% believe you. Now what date do I buy my $CORN otm calls?
Bot keeps trying to delete but yeah cr y p tos.
I no longer believe you know stuff. Or maybe you do but I only buy $hibcoin. Why not just bet on stuff that's actually 100% certain like commodities?
If you want to bet commodities just go for oil.

That's got the best setup for high inflation: 1) US has been in heavy export mode of late at the wrong time, 2) frackers aren't expanding production because their backers want them to be much more tight on Capex this time so that won't provide downward pressure, and 3) massive gamma ramp setup in place due to massive buying on $100 contracts.
I bet on biodiesel because we have a finite supply of oil, but an infinite supply of sunlight :)
COIN is gonna moon at open
It's almost like having a diversified portfolio is the best way to protect yourself.
Also insulates you from gains.
So you’re saying I don’t have to yolo every transaction? 🤔
You mean like a savings account?
Hoping we do a real dump today, these baby dumps aren't exciting yet
Theta gang and MM coming to fuck 1000p TSLA options. That OI and volume is as fat as a pig ready to be gutted.

Could be wrong, probably am ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Correct for one minute so far lmaooo
TSLA bounce off 1000 like a rubber ball
AMZN green lol

Can't wait for those SNDL earnings. SNDL $1.00 EOW
Today feels like a fucking bull trap.

Be honest, any of you ever tried calling these companies to get intel? Lmao
I had a meeting with a PLTR consultant and will never buy their stock again.

I called a penny stock when I was like 19 to get info and posted it on a message board and the stock surged 1000% to $0.002
My boy!
Wut would we even ask? Hey got any insider info?
You mean, that doesn’t work?
One more day of -1% and we will back cruising by ATH. Can’t keep this market down
I feel like the market is actually broken. Can we get sept 2020 esque circuit breakers in here? Spy barely drops a dollar what the fuckkk is happening
you mean March 2020?
That’s too hardcore. I just want it to react to the negative news.
Gotcha, I was just pointing it out because we didn't have circuit breakers last September. Last March however....
Prog is going to fall by close believe it
And dump after earnings
You started it tesla



RIVN gonna finish it!!!


CANYONEROOOO!!!!! 🐓
What's the truck with four wheel drive that has a shitty IPO at $125?
I hope sofi drops to 13 again, would be a nice entry point.
Why is F dumping wtf
.70%.. stop crying
Because I bought calls finally .. sorry
Same time everyday, so I assume day traders  and robots selling off.
I have no clue. Very upset.
Cats out of the bag for $PROG earnings, starting to fly
You think 100% by eod like SOPA?
Yes, thinking tom we open around $5.25
Should I buy Rivian?
At 120 that’s a hard choice
Buy F
No
Fuk yes

Bout to pop 

Early sofi orders couldn't even get filled 

Early investors can't sell for 120 days min
Rivian expected to open at $120

The $78 ipo put them at near a 70 billion.dollar market cap


So 107 billion market cap right off the bat?

They were overvalued at 70 even
so.... 5min run up?
Welcome to the 21st century! Markets don’t function like they used to
Reminds me of BMBL IPO
SPY 470 EOW thoughts?

Solid DD. Dumping my life savings in asap
Damn the COIN momentum died quick
Just looking for an Hourly higher low. Considering it was down 14% AH, today's price action is very bullish
I’m still holding my calls from earlier this morning. So yeah I believe
I’m too scared, bros. Putting my cash in blue chips for a few weeks lmao.

Listen man, I was born in the darkness
Think the correction is a slow and painful one
 Buy the AMDip ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Anyone else buy this amd dip?
Fed being forced by inflation to hike sooner is not priced in.
Fed may just ignore it and keep printing so they keep their own jobs.  Powell, Yellen, and Cathie Wood are the last people left who don't believe in inflation.
because it won't happen
Lost $200 today, anyone else lose more so I can feel better?
Down 6.5k and dropping like a turd
Add 2 zeros.
1 month ago I lost 37k in an hour. Two days before that I lost 8k.
Those ain’t bags bro
$200? What is that… a loss for ants??!
Haha, it’s a small challenge account. Only at $1150 now so that’s 20% of my port
I lost $2k this week so far!
I did couple days ago
Down 1k. 11/19 470C
Down 1.2k, waiting for my F calls to recover
I wish I only lost 200 today
4K in two days
Rivian IPO values it at 98 billion. 

The biggest IPO ever was BaBA and it only popped to 25 billion. 

🤡🤡🤡
Can I get a one word reason to put my life savings into rivian noe
IPO at almost 100b value. Produces 2 cars a day.

Coin 2: electric vehicle Boogaloo
Wtf do you guys buy that make you scream this much w/ less than 1% pullback

Still holding for on 225c call, hope a miracle happens
TSLA will fly tomorrow if the broad market isn’t red

Does anyone here actually like Rivian
I like F so I need to like Rivian as well.
I like your logic
Yes.
I like Amazon
Circuit breakers tomorrow?
Shut up ffs with the circuit breakers
You scared?
No, it’s just dumb as fuck. 

Think of the context of what was happening in the world the last *and only* time breakers have ever happened.
I thought the markets were closed for veteran's day
Just the bond market
Lol meme stock bulls are retards
The holders are retards .. the people trading and scalping have been making a killing for months .
MVIS DOWN ON NEWS THAT MALL RETAIL STORE SPENCERS WILL NOT ENTER INTO A PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT TO SELL MVIS PATENTED LASER POINTER TECHNOLOGY.

THE CEO OF SPENCERS LATER CONFIRMED THAT THE CHAIN RETAILER WOULD INSTEAD INVEST MORE COMPANY RESOURCES INTO BUILDING UP THEIR FAKE PLASTIC DOG POOP INVENTORY.
i cannot tell if you're joking or not, is this the top?
LOL MVIS what a turd company, if they actually made dog poop they might bring in some $$
Arrest and charge Musk. Fukin shit up for me and I don’t fukin have tesla
You really tried to get in at the top ? Not back in summer?  


Tough scene.
If QQQ can close at $388 I'm chalking this up to a healthy bounce of $400. Same with SPY at $460. Close over $460 and it's just a bounce off $470.  


Still Bullish.
Bulls r fuk
I need TSLA to crash down to 800 at this point.
fuck I'd be so rich pls do
REPENT YOUR SINS, THE END IS NEAR

Tesla is incredible. Insane.
Tanking for the Musks pockets?
imagine looking at inflation and all the chaos around you and thinking

"yes, this is the time to be a bull"
Inflation makes stock prices to up.
Draft kings or PayPal FDs?
Neither. $200,000 Tesla FDs!!
Don't touch either, seriously.
Short everything over bought.  AMD, NVDA, AFRM, COIN etc.  you’ll thank me by Friday.
Honestly TLRY can choke on a cock. Piece of shit of a stonk. Playing around with all the markets it can just to fuck with stoners meanwhile it wipes out little guys. At this point TLRY pump wrecks the entire market. Fucked up a stonk so insane has that much of a pull. TLRY ruined the great end of year melt up early with its retarded being TLRY.

Tesla is still up for the day yet the 🌈 🐻 act like they just retired
Everything selling off cuz ppl putting their money into another gay EV company
What do you apes think about $SNDL?
Sold it months ago and put the money into uranium and made 50-80% as I sprinkled across the miners. Meanwhile SNDL still same spot. Guess what I think about it
When SPY is $480 next week you won’t be laughing at me
i'm with ya...
This Brandon guy really sucks
Judge is torching the prosecutor in the Rittenhouse case. Kid is gonna walk.
Shorting Kenosha businesses for the inevitable riots.
Get ready for a non-think piece on WS judge
Rittenhouse was attacked by 3 people who kept attacking him and they had guns too so it was self defense and the 1 survivor admitted Rittenhouse was attacked first lol
He was literally running away
He put himself in that position.  A responsible law abiding gun owner would not have.
Ya, what was he wearing. Looked like he wanted to get jumped. Seriously though, kid is an idiot. Should get some punishment but doubt he gets anything serious.

Alright go ahead and upload a better one, i’ll be waiting.
Cool just chuck some lines through the price action
Impossible to do it like that when zoomed out lmao

Puts on your portfolio balance

Sofi puts must be the play
Idk man. Everything has been crazy lately.  I agree that puts seems right but who knows what will happen in this market.
i'm long sofi. But they will fuck this on good or bad earnings. Maybe they are trying to kill the calls who knows.

Tesla is a meme stock now
Lmao you mean the last two years?
Look at charts. Look at past double tops. This was the first pullback. We could even see a green day tomorrow and then to red. Buy puts with long expiration dates and don't get greedy. Market is due for a pullback. It's not about what side you're on. It's about being smaht. Wicked smaht.
talking about being smart, Sir you are in a wrong sub.
Hey all you armchair Econ majors out there. Inflationary environments make markets go uppies, not downies you fucking retards.  Now go back to the corner and eat some crayons and sniff some glue.
Does 6% inflation correlate to 100% market moves though?

Buying now is brave with Evergrande and inflation, cant lie
Yeah nobody saw evergrande coming and the smart thing to do during inflation is go cash solid take
Last chance to buy PUTS ON EVERYTHING! Evergrande defaulted today too
Gyna is fake and gay
if the zillow shit and evergrande are at all tied together, housing bubble bursts, I see DOCU having more downside. They say don't fight the trend. I think the trend is pretty well established now. Lumber prices dropping, zillow dropping, people aint' signing shit anymore.
It’s china!  I would touch that stock with a 12ft pole.  Bets they manipulate it.

AMD will grow so much, 3 big good news
1. New multibillion contracts
2. New series of microchips
3. Powering the Steam Deck nintendo switch killer

so i feel like a year from now they will have +200%
That’s obvious… but what’s AMD price EOW?
> AMD price EOW is 0.00%
Spy calls when?

U guys buying Rivian or waiting a week?
At $90-100 it sounds ridiculous to buy and hold. Unless you just cash out on a pump
Waiting
Playing F instead
Excited to pay $25 for a quarter pounder combo at McDonald’s in 15 years!  But it’ll be transitory!!!
15 years lmao
RIVN & Allbirds IPO all so overvalued
Allbirds too?? I like their shoes so I bought shares when they first went live.
Yeah, look at their financials. Don’t get me wrong love their shoes. But waiting for cheaper entry.
Yea I can see that. Good call. 

Meanwhile your buddy SPY is making some moves today. Think it breaks $470 EOW?
This monetary policy is 100% going to result in an economic depression. With high inflation and low interest rates, you are encouraging taking ridiculous loans and unlimited leverage. What happens when inflation catches up with the consumer and revenues and profits drop. I mean, we are a year or two from the crash so ride the wave but let’s not fool ourselves.
The taxpayer bails out the financial classes while the plebs fend for themselves. American as Apple Pie.
So, BTFD?
Correct but until then you need to preserve your purchasing power.
No retard here denies a collapse isn’t going to happen within a couple years .

I'd buy Enron today.

The greatest comeback since MJ returned to the bulls.
Is Smiles Direct Club due a small pump?
Its shareholders need a small penis pump.
Haha. After a 20% plus drop yesterday, not bad value
They dropped an abysmal earnings report that's why. Wouldn't touch it even at $1
From yesterday’s lows it’s up 10%, I can’t see it getting a huge pump if much more than what it got on that earnings report.
Due bankrupt
You probably are all correct about it. Tesla also almost went bankrupt once.;-)
no lmao
I guess Tesla rocket ran out of electricity and crashing back hard. #TeamBearForNow
JK. RIP My PUT

do you expect it back in the 3 digits today :( ?

My putz looking kinda thicc
who is going to score next, bears or bulls, or will theta gang steal the ball. I say bears
Currently sitting on 5k of Ford weekly puts worth 9k right now. Not selling till they're worth 50k
Double or nothing. Exit the position and use that 9k to buy more OTM options.
holding is the same thing lmao
You're ITM to be in profit. Risking it all on OTM options is not the same...

With the 4k of additional capital, you have more buying power now for the cheaper OTM options.

This is the way true wsb legends are made.
It's a fuckin $20 stock. I'm not gonna buy $15 puts. The $19 and $20 puts I have reflect that I think it's going to hit $18 and not any lower
I see why your wife prefers her boyfriend now. He's got much bigger balls.
Not too late to switch to calls.

my 3710 shares are waiting to be stimulated. there is a DD post on SENS on WSB 1hrs ago. Could move above $6
Key word "could"
Anyone know when Rivian options will be available?
no sooner than 3 days after it starts trading.
typically five days after IPO iirc
Minimum 3 days after IPO
Lol rivian hasn’t even started yet.
Dude, you need a new chart or broker
My portfolio is down 0.02% GUH

It’s me Jim Cramer. Who are you?
6.2%. 6.2%!!!! And you retard bulls are going to pretend to be okay with this? I've been saying since 2020, inflation would spiral out of control from all the spending and stimulus. Well, now I'm right and the Fed is proving to be wrong. There is no way this is sustainable. Interest rates are going to be rapidly increased way before anyone expects. Stupid Fed destroying economy, should be imprisoned. Complete manipulation of markets too
Stocks are a hedge against inflation. You gonna just sit cash and rapidly lose value everyday? Stock market =/= economy seems to be a lesson that people have to learn over and over.
> The stock market is a casino. It has no correlation with the economy, and it's not even possible to predict what stocks will do in the short term.
The stock market is a different beast.

If you don't understand these things, stfu
Anytime you try to talk about anything having to do with reality or actual facts the degenerate permabulls start downvoting and calling you a gay bear. That’s when you realize the vast majority on here are just kids who have only been in the market the last year while it was on easy mode. They are the same ones who will be crying the loudest and begging for mercy so it will make it all worth it watching them get gaped.

Chill, bro, it's a party. Low rates will continue, inflation will settle down, stocks will stay up for a bit. Ride the wave.

It's really not. Maybe step away from the internet for a bit.
Alright big guy, we'll revisit this in a year when SPY is around $200

Funny of you to think I’m holding bags🤣🤣

For me, yes. 6 otm calls expiring Friday. Need a 5% pop to recoup losses. Think it will trend downward with the rest of the market over the next week or so. Idk I’m just bearish right now

The reasons we're down this week:

1. Big Guys sell stocks because of Taxes
2. Healthy Pull-Back/Corrections
3. Something big is going on behind the screen
4. People sell to be ready for Nancy Pelosi next big move
Or just, you know, regular fluctuations that we see literally all the time.
As long as it’s not September 2.0
Yeah, spy been overbought for like a week now.  Needed to cool off for the next leg up.
$COIN is on a ridiculous fucking discount rn
From may till September was the discount
Fair enough but with like a $415 target $330 is still a ways to go
It's a trash app
Imagine thinking SPY is breaking $470 this week….
oh cool, another bull trap
GME is the only safe stonk to put your money. Everything else full of paper handed pussies. 

What other stock has an army pouring their entire paycheck into direct registered shares every week no matter what the market does?

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
This sub doesnt really do shares.  More of 0dte options all on margin.

Wsb is more gambling than investing
GME shares move like options that never expire with more upside
you sir are special
I’m no gay bear but HSBC 20/25P Jan 21.
NASDAQ and S&P down, another red day ?
I got calls on both, so deep red it is.
I don’t know friend I shorted half the market so mostly the tech sode, so it’s gonna open green
Something tells me, this market will have the both of us in the red by day's end
Possibly I bought the tech puts on Monday. $xly 207.5p has 300% to lose before it’s red. The qqq 390p 0DTE are gonna cost me everything tho 😂

inflation is good for “digital gold”

I'm so anxious about Rivian and I'm not even planning to get in 😂
Watching cgc and tlry, cgc looked good yesterday when other weed stock were flat or terrible like cron. My shitty technical analysis says that if cgc can breakthrough the $15 range it’s heading back to $25
PT for tlry?
Scared to see my account update. Balls deep in MVDA calls for 11/18
Sofi died before earnings even csme out...priced in fok r a loss guess im holding
Just need PLTR to go up a little bit this month so I can dump the FUUUCK out of it.
PLTR = Dog Shit
 ⬆️ that is real investment advice. 

Facts.
Sold most of my shares 2 months ago when it was over $28. I wouldn't buy again over $24
So what’s everyones plan for Sofi earnings today? Something telling me Put City.
If the general sentiment is puts yo should get calls. DASH was a perfect example
I have calls so it’s prob gonna dump
Today is my last day if probation at my new job. If I don’t hear from HR should I speak to my supervisor or just carry on ?

Why does it feel good to be cash gang? You just found out that your cash is worth 1% less since last month

I was wondering why so many pushed SDC and Root and it seems they're on the top 20 high short interest list.

In that case where are all the people shilling BYND?
SDC has been a meme stock forever it has nothing to do with short interest. You people need to stop fucking acting like short interest is an important indicator of anything. Unless short interest is *extremely* high, like +85% of float, it means Jack shit.
Clearly didn't read the post
So what’s everyones plan for Sofi earnings today? Something telling me Put City.
Inflation isn't real.
I am glad I sold at open. Shits turned down but i was still considerable up
SDC is the only thing green in my portfolio. How sad is that.

But properly prepped, brined, and cooked turkey.  That shit is moist and ungodly levels of deliciousness.

Rule 201 is in effect today on Tesla. Just in case anyone thinks that pump on Tesla was a legit recovery.

Might want to hold off on calls.
You seeing a possible drop to $950?

It’ll crash probably like amd and nvda the next day.
At least DIS waking up for me
Can't wait to get puts at close

Hope so, I've got some beautiful bags I bought on "the dip"
Any big service industry stocks out there? Like restaurant chains and hotels? Hear me out, the cost of labor has gone through the roof and inflation has increased the cost of food substantially.  Knowing this, I bought about $800 on Madison square garden entertainment puts and made about 40% on those in the last two days. Any other stock you guys would recommend in the same sector?
Big guys in that industry are Sysco, Performance Food Group, Aramark, Sodexo, Compass Group
Thanks, highly appreciated.

So UPST crushed earnings, and sheds 16+%? What the shit?

$RKT is on a run up again. Held since the last dip. Might add more on the run up. Potential increases in interest rates will yield higher dividends for the financial sectors.
Buying PLTR
Its still op. Wait til it hot 19$
What time does rivian ipo?
Supposedly around 10:20 but who knows
For all the volume in Door Dash today, there really doesn't seem to be much interest in pushing the price anymore
Well it goes both ways, if you managed to make over 300% on Tesla puts yesterday, why not take the gains? It’s basically 50% lower than what they close at yesterday 🤷‍♂️. Don’t be greedy is the lesson
Timed the AAPL dip 😍
Everybody in this room knew Spy would jam higher and go green if you didn’t you were in denial
Eventually, yea, but theta scares me even on long calls.

The stock would have went down more than it did. The sell off was the rumor. Not the event.
Not if he used derivatives or off market sales. I could see that he’s started to sell off but isn’t doing it all in bulk.
That's why I hesitated putting an order in at 1k. Kinda wish I had though.
Bear traps all around
Yolo into AFRM if you like money

NOK low of day . 5.50 puts for next week will print
Honest question; y’all think PLTR will get around or over 50$ a year or two from now?
Honest answer, as someone who loves karp and PLTR, I don't care. I just want to exit my position at break even. Fuck this stock
Average cost?
$25, been wanting to exit at $30 for a small profit for months but it never hits it. The next time it hits 25 im done
It got above $28 a couple of months ago. That's when I sold most of my shares. Glad I did, too. I would buy again if it gets down close to $20
I know I said to myself when it was 28 that it was enough but I convinced myself to just wait until 30..... I literally just want out lol
Just got a downgrade today by RBC I believe.
Honestly, no but that's the thing with the market you never know what could happen.
Nah bro r/stocks has a pretty good breakdown of why pltr isn’t rising go check it out

NKLA PRIMED TO MOVE
Where to 0?
Sofi only gave me a 30 minute window to confirm that I wanted to buy Rivian at the ipo price. While I was asleep. What the fuck sofi. You dropped the ball.
Sounds like you dropped the ball.
Come on SPY just tank and get that correction over with. We all know you’re going to keep going parabolic right after
High inflation? Just take all of the poor people's money 

Problem solved

Biden, I'll be awaiting my nomination
WISH going to exceed expectations and have some good pump news in earnings call. Back to $10 by end of next week baby!
$WISH rebound incoming.

Wish introduced the ***Wish Standards*** program to incentivize quality products and other positive behaviors from its merchants. The new program, which was announced at Wish’s Global Merchant Summit, measures merchants against a defined set of criteria spanning product quality, shipping experience, customer reviews, refund rates and compliance with Wish policies. 

Merchants who qualify for the program will benefit from commission discounts, expedited payment terms and greater exposure for their products within the app. They will also carry a ‘Premier Merchant Badge’ that will feature prominently across their product listings and merchant store.
Oh yes
10 mins till double up
When do we buy 👀
So is Elon selling his stock bullish? Debating about buying FD’s at close for Friday
I don't know about bullish, but it was going to happen eventually. He unloaded it all yesterday. Nothing has changed about the company. I'm still holding. Looking forward to moving on from twitter debacles, hopefully, and getting back to being excited about all the great things coming for TSLA.
How do you know he unloaded all yesterday??
I don't think he'd wait this long. Volume from yesterday matches roughly what he'd have to sell. Look for the SEC form today on TSLA site to confirm. 95% sure it's already done.
He’s not sold yet. Nothing has been filed with the sec.
Is this what a great recession feels like?
"Buy when there's blood in the streets" is not a metaphor. It's a euphemism for buying when people are literally jumping from rooftops.

That's how bad recessions get in the market.

Edit: I know you were being sarcastic, but it's a serious matter.
Not even close.

It will definitely dump less than UPST, right?

Market fucking everyone today
Evergrande has fallen
Black Thursday Black Friday
I said what what
why is this evergrande thing news? i thought it was already known that they defaulted
Gold has been getting slammed recently. When everyone is bearish, it is time to start buying, especially with this level of inflation and the ten year mooning right now.
Mooning back to its consistent lows the last 5 months?
Getting ready for rocket leaps🐸🐸🐸
Rivian reminds me of nikola
except their car works?
Markets down. Ban bets triggering! Gyna rocketing!! CHAOS!!!!!
I survived a PLTR to 23 bet. Now I may talk trash about Karp and his insiders being the most predictable scum on this planet. Skynet will bankrupt everyone first, then bring down the hammer.

Whoa, slow down... today isn't over yet, bud.
Just went nearly all in (extra cash) in $PLTR. I’m sorry shorts. You’re going to be squeezed. Selling $TSLA here and there to slowly add as well. See y’all at $26+ again!
Settle down sparky. Karp and his band of elite insiders won’t let this happen.
Say goodbye to your puts too
Don’t have any. Sold covered calls and will continue to do so with my pile of 21$ per shares. This thing is not going over 30 this year and probably won’t go over 27 until 2022. Too many bag holders haven’t given up yet. Once they do this will moon.
LOL idk we might see $29 this year
So is amd still a growth stonk orrrrrr
Imagine never delivering a single vehicle to a non-employee and yet still being considered the 5th most valuable car company in the world.  Crazy times.

Why don't they just call Frito-Lay?
They actually produced cars AMD is ending microchip shortage ao then F will be doing great
What do we think rivian is going to do after hours? Crash harder?
Do your part! Buy American treasury bonds and help fund these massive deficits! 🇺🇸
First time doing puts, did $215 on DASH expiring Friday. Easy money so far but should I wait until expiration to see if it tanks?
Take profit when you can. Dont be a greedy pig like me. NVDIA fucked me over big time this way. Was up 200% now down %200.

A win is a win. Take it
absolutely lol'ing at anyone who bought rivian today
!banbet CRCT +30% 2W
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
As if there is support at 100 dollars, lmao. gonna drop even harder once the buyers sell their shares again going from 100 dollars downwards. bearish.
Hmmm what to do? Why the dump? Is this the beginning of the end of the bull market?
I dunno but I bought calls
This week had the meme earnings no wonder it's all shit.
TOST gonna stay above $50 so that 10 million shares from IPO lockup investors can sell tomorrow, that bitch gonna drill to fucking 45 at least. Easy 10 bagger on the 50 puts. Book it.

you do realize thats a P&D, right?
evergrande black swan? 👹🚬
It’s apparently being broken up by the Chinese government behind the scenes, being made into several smaller companies and the process will take years to complete. China doesn’t want the negative image of their real estate market, so will likely not let them default.
Good to hear. I’d prefer not to have a global market shakedown.
This swan has laid a bunch of nasty little black eggs that will be hatching soon.
Can a brotha get a 469.69 close in this bitch? gotdamn
I see Tesla is having a pre Black Friday sale.  $200 off on TSLA shares.  Think that would be a good bet or is Elon going to turn around and Fork me right up the ass like he's often known to do?

We're not even in correction territory yet. Calm down you two-dump chump.

wow spy puts was the play
Temped to buy spy at this level , dumb or dumb?
Me too so probably dumb. Just bought a few calls.
Yes.
Yes!
What's your play? You could buy leaps here and be fine. You could buy weekly puts and you might make some money. You might not though.
> I'm going to buy some shares of GME.
Solid play, visualmod. You might be one of the best traders here.
I’m super tempted to buy spy calls right now. I’m thinking like three weeks out.
Oh boy look out below TSLA
Seems like elon started selling lol
Isn’t this the part where JPOW turns the stock market back on or something? These stocks are only supposed to go up?

Stay away for your own soul
Was waiting for tattooed chef but the option spread was too high. Was looking at 12/10 $20 call for an earnings play but probably will skip it and watch from the sidelines
Bynd calls inverse the norm
$BROS
So when are we going to price in the tesla ponzi scheme?
The whole market is a ponzi scheme thus its has already been priced in
BYND 90P gonna print right?
One would hope
Selling my weekly AMD calls for a minor loss when it hit 146 is absolutely my best call today. My worst call was holding my AMD calls after they were up 100% yesterday.
Its been moonshotting all week eventually it had to crash. I bought in at $130, held $150, and sold around $140 when it started falling.

If it shoots up for an entire week it will eventually come crashing down HARD.
AFRM puts and OPEN calls save me
so I thought PLTR would blow past 29 after tuesday.
I sold a $31 covered call 😈
Holy shit 300% IV. That's insane even for earnings

Shoutout to all the PLTR clowns who downvoted me yesterday before the open saying that the earnings report was terrible.

Anytime you try to talk about anything having to do with reality or actual facts the degenerate permabulls start downvoting and calling you a gay bear. That’s when you realize the vast majority on here are just kids who have only been in the market the last year while it was on easy mode. They are the same ones who will be crying the loudest and begging for mercy so it will make it all worth it watching them get gaped.

please note that this is my conservative price target. Bull case spy $3000.
F is awesome but it’s a sell on news with Rivian IPO today
What news?
I am not a gay bear.  But can we please have a conversation about China real estate conversation collapse plays and inflation plays?

What are people buying?  YANG puts?  YINN calls?
No one likes to talk about that 😅
Shouldn't this be YANG calls / YINN puts?
Thoughts on TWNK? Like is it okay that that’s Hostess’s ticker?
Who doesn't love a good twink?
Gold, Silver and Platinum… told you…. Get in before we skyrocket.  The one thing about precious metals… supply / demand… buy miners as well.   Once traders inflate prices it’s going to go ape shit higher because industry MUST buy at any price.
Flush it tesla 🙃
This is the top for F for at least 3 months
That's bull chit currently. If they take their stake out of rivian then yes it may be the top.
Rivian will tank after today just like every other overpriced IPO this year
Yea but Ford is poor man's rivian play
NOTE THIS. RIVN PRICING AT $120 A SHARE IS GOING TO POP THE EV BUBBLE TODAY. WAY TOO GREEDY, TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE, IT'S OVER. RIVN going to $50 in a few days, LCID going to $30
Yeah, it's Rivian at $120 and not Lucid or Nikola or $1300 Tesla that's going to finally pop the EV bubble.
It's all that of course, over the last year and a half, but there has to be a final moment that finally will pop it and this is it.
The death throes of a corrupt and dying civilization
#Bears be like...

Dont get emo fags. I was bullish yesterday. 

Bought 1000p after TSLA hit 1075. This is a dead cat bounce PLUS you have Rivian going live. 

Dunno if it’ll hit 1000 but it’s going to definitely give up 1-2%.
You should go all-in, that'll show them.
12 +0.5% green days followed by 1 "0.3%" correction. . .

this is not a bubble. . .
SPY dropping 0.3% doesn't make the accounts on this sub drop 0.3%

"Be fearful when others are greedy."
Uh it’s crashing means people are fearful,
umm it's definitely going up because people are buying calls thinking it's over, and all their money will be stolen.

Up 40k today from F puts, AMZN puts, LCID puts. How so many fucking morons fall for buy the rumor, sell the news every fuckin time amazes me. You can check my comment history - I posted my positions yesterday
Proof or ban, person who doesn’t know what a ‘rumor’ is.
you obviously don't know what buy the rumor sell the news means
Even if that’s true, understanding that phrase would require knowing what a rumor is, so sounds like the score is -1:-2 in my favor.

#MADE A EASY $2500 THIS MORNING IM GOING BACK FO BED
I made 10K, do better
Coin is such a buy the dip opportunity. These fools had ridiculously great q4 guidance by 74% QOQ upside and q3 disappoint was expected by everyone and their mother.
Yeah I have shares and may add. I wasn’t too spooked. 🌽 at all time high and trading picking back up.

Also like non-transaction revenue growing. And “other digital assets” trading volume growing.
180bil transaction volume in October. 330bil all of q2. The earnings call as well was super optimistic. These guys/girls in charge understand their business model very well.
Yeah what I really want to see is the custody/other services generate some real money. Volatility trading is great but the next level is unlocking another more sustainable revenue stream with the institutional.
I agree. I like that their services rev is in high growth though even though it’s still small. Nfts are coming within a month but will most likely show q1 and I think they have a hint of custody with their Meta deal.
Yeah I’m definitely not selling after this report. Will keep an eye on them.
Looking at the price of the assets that must not be named, it is due for a 10% correct IMO.  If that happens I’ll consider Coin shares
Happened last week. I’ve never seen anything triple top either. Usually when it hits its ath the 3rd time, it continues upward. We will see though November 14 with spot etf approval. If that gets hammered, all 🌽 will with it
If you look back at April you can see the same pattern starting to form.
Die TESLA DIE!
Notice how SPY is dead but XRT is at an all time high? Crazy how the etf with all the basket shorts is mooning while everything else dies. 

GME about to turn all you haters into fomo apette groupies. Better get those 🍌 ready
> You're retarded.
using tesla gain to hold rivian🤫
Only got allocated 44 shares of RIVN on SOFI. There is so much demand for this ipo, I think it’s going to pop 30% at open.
How the fuck did you get 44? I only got 25 and that’s by working with one of the companies doing the underwriting.
I signed up for SOFI and asked for 100 🤷🏻‍♂️
I am thinking 💭 f buying 2 share of Rivian what you think?
*Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, never--in nothing, great or small, large or petty--never give in, except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.*

Question:
When a normal retail investor checks out about a company and realizes it's been there for a decade as an industry leader , with good growth year by year, quarter by quarter, and also good guidance for the next quarter, then is he supposed to hold that stock?

Check $PLTR stock and decide for yourself whether any stock market basics hold good here?

It's the Market Manipulators Vs Small guys...

We don't stand a chance unless everyone realizes their game!!!!

Big oof! 6.2% inflation for the month.
good effort bulls, but I just added more puts. gg
Bulls celebrating too early
Bulls about to be broken when SPY drops. 

My prediction: 465-467 throughout the week.
Ah yes, a 12 dolla range, I also predict that
Lol, I meant 467.
Die SoFI Die! Down 5% PUTS PUTS PUTS
There is a sale on Palantir over in the software section of the market !!  Just Hodlin' here...
30x P/S with only 36% growth you’re a chump if you think that’s a sale my friend
Explain to me as if I’m a 5 year old dog - what is futures trading. Need retarded knowledge for job interview

Really looks like it's going to $135 if the market doesn't bounce
No. It's not. Back to 130 at least
Biggest disappointment:

Palantir: No revenues. No one expect the secret services and army wants their product. 

Build on hype. Momentum has gone finally. And also selling of the options from the management to step away from this unicorn project. Soros has lost his faith also. Mee, too. It is not the next big 2 Trl company, sorry guys.
when your cost is $8 and you’ve been selling calls against them, it’s essentially a free stock
Soros lost his faith on them. I don’t bet against him.

Roughly 5 million short sold shares on RNG are underwater by $70 per share at the open based on analysis of past 6 months short interest/prices.  Keep an eye on RNG to see if anything happens today.

Normal volume is 1 million on this stock, and there's nowhere near enough volume for those shorts to cover fast.

Could see a CAR situation here, watch the volume/options on RNG early.  Really quick DD, so don't know whether this will pan out...
just a friendly reminder that if inflation were measured using the same methodology that they used in the 1980s, we would be at \~14% or so rather than the 6% print we just got, which is basically at levels that volcker had to raise rates to 20% to bring it down.

that wont happen this time though, but dont forget that these fukkers are lying through their teeth with the 6% print and pretending like we have seen worse in the 1980s

Next week will be huge. Earnings for nvidia on the 16th, we will get sympathy, then Samsung - AMD collaboration announced in June but no device shown so not priced in. We will get phones with AMD mobile gpu on 19th. We will rally, position now and buy before the hedge funds so they’re forced to buy and not sell the news. Buy AMD calls !
Theres my boy NIO.

Do i dump Ford bags now?
Ford isn't going to be able to sell their Rivian stake for quite some time, so it's all paper value. They're locked in and it'll probably tank well before they can divest.
Afternoon pump
Imagine you have $8.58 cents left in a brokerage account. Where monke yolo? 

I just bought 1491.42 of stonks to hold with diamond hands until the sun explodes. I have $8.58 left from my deposit. What are some stonks that are around that price?

What's a stock around that price that might round out the rest of my portfolio?

Edit: I picked up 12 more shares of SNDL for $8.38.

Fact: Some stocks, are worth over $1000 per share.

Fact: SNDL is a stock.

I'm going to be rich!

It's wild how people want to pretend that huge run-ups in stock happen for no reason and that nothing ever gets priced in.
Alright retards I need some help. Turned 500 to 20$ on Pypl calls yesterday. Doubled that to 50$ with Sofi puts. Give me some cheap options to help this autist claw back to break even. Many thanks
Calls on spy v shape into the green
Will Tesla pump with riv?
Heck naw. Probably the opposite. It's competition.
Is it really though. Comparing Walmart to family dollar dawg.
Not only competition in the market for ev's, it's also competition in the market for ev investors.
I remember when I was newbie and one of my first trades thanks to wsb was buying GME at 75, and AMC at 7 dllrs, thank you guys, have been a wild ride 💎
F 12/17 30c are almost 0.12 and when ford goes to $20 the price of the calls hits .20. Might do this again lol

Just go straight to the official source instead of searching for it retard.

SPY hasn't had a -5% since 2018, one of the longest runs to never have a negative 5 point day in stock market history...
do you have selective amnesia of March 2020?
I’m sorry where the fuck were you March 2020?
there must’ve been a -5% day in 2020
I don't think people get how bad inflation really is for an economy. Simply "Raising rates" in 2022 ain't gonna cut it. 

Inflation is about expectation of inflation, no one's gonna give a shit about a .25 interest rate hike once every 6 months.
Is $RIOT going to moon if Rittenhouse is found not guilty?

Maybe getting dragged down by the rest of the market. Also, and probably more likely, a correction/profit taking after the big run up over the last month.

Transitionary means .. when the ports aren’t backed up anymore will the prices go down .

We won’t know until all the congestion’s done and we are back to normal volume . Could be middle of next year but nobody knows 

Transitionary doesn’t mean a couple
Months and we are back to normal pricing
I thought it means inflation goes back to normal. Stuff is always getting more expensive unless things deflationary. We just want it to stop getting more expensive so quickly.

That's what I was thinking, but then also i'd be mad at myself if I lose gains that I desperately need, but they don't expire until Friday too.
if you need the gains then sell both. Key word is "need." don't get greedy
Hold bitch. The mouse owns Shrek and his big dick energy. Today is the day (or Friday during disney+ event)

GIPR - 400% runner today mark my words
Why?
with the volume of 11 at this time I don't think it will.
Ban bet
GIPR is going to be the big runner for today after the sopa run!
If I have calls expiring 11/26 and 12/3 should sell them for a loss now or wait it out?
let me ask my magic nuts. Bro no one here knows literally anything. We think we do but, we are all just guessing. Some get luckier than others.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Wait, this dip will likely be over by the end of the week.
Calls for what and what strike ?

If they are already down so much they are worthless, might as well hold. 

If they are only down 20%-50%, it really depends on the ticker and expectations, but I’d sell them and cut my losses.
Lucid $55 12/3
CAT $220 12/3 
NVDA $350 11/19 
LULU $500 11/26
Just my take -
I’d keep the Lucid and Cat for awhile and see how they do, but if they don’t start coming up by the end of this week, sell. 

Id sell NVDA and LULU now. They already ran up, especially NVDA, and you don’t have much time. I think Theta is going to eat those up quick.
Calls on what?
LCID
I'm an idiot on the internet but I'd hold them. With Rivian IPO and Ford skyrocketing before launch, the EV sentiment is really high, especially as Tesla is imploding on itself with all the drama this week. I bet next week things will be better. 

Not financial advice, just an idiot saying what I would do.
Your are not idiot. You are 100% in the money!. Hold and buy more. LCID at $40 is only the floor.
If I can drag these Hyzon shares into Friday earnings without getting red dildo, I'll buy you all a beer.

When you buy triple leveraged options (SOXL TQQQ UVXY) is the leverage priced in?

Because I want to play either NVDA or SOXL csp (would love to own either of those)
If you want to play levered 3rd? order derivatives, you came to the right place. Can’t wait for your loss porn.
SOXL was good for me but sold around 50. I’d get back in at 40
The leverage is generally priced in and the more liquid non-leveraged options are often the better buy. Notice the price differences between qqq and tqqq delta.
So NVDA csp would make more sense than SOXL, even with the buying power effect?
You will have to check at the time you enter the trade. Sometimes the markets are weird. Also, a csp might be a dangerous play today, especially on a triple leveraged etf.
Yes. If the qs jump 1 percent tqqq jumps three. They're designed for short term plays because it also means they take longer to recover than the underlying.
So is DASH returning to after market highs at open? Trying to figure out if my calls are going to be 3 or 5 baggers.

Just punch yourself in the balls
SHCR had a blowout quarter, had a great earnings call this morning, only up from here. Partnering with the biggest health care providers in the country and presenting at the White House today. Options still cheap. Some buying pressure could give this a jump.
Has someone tried turning SPY off and then on again?
VZIO up 20%.Finally people start realizing it would overtake Roku in no time
I really didn’t think FUBO would dump that hard off good earnings

$VIA RENEWABLES
First IPO. Estimated price is $78 so should I put in an order for $78 or will it come out higher?
It’s already at 121
Obviously higher
Put it higher… it’ll execute at whatever it ends up opening. 

If it’s too low you miss it.
Estimated price is north of $120.  The IPO price is for select investment bank clients.  You can't get it.

But, more than half of IPOs trade lower than that price in their first couple weeks
Poor bears, they can’t get any follow through or momentum. I mean you just have to have perfect timing to be a bear.

Gonna average more into mgni though
I made such a huge mistake.  Last week I made a dumb daytrade and did not have one left this morning to flip a Tsla call.  Coulda had 5k after just 10x my Tsla p from yesterday morning at open.
learn the ghetto spread. no more worrying about day trades
Yes, lock in gains. It caps profit but locks those gains in when you can't daytrade.
Should have sold the next put down. Read this. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/iax8nq/updated_intro_guide_to_options/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
Oh no. I sold my put at open for 10x.  I just wasted a daytrade last Friday so I could not buy and sell a call this morning on the bounce. And I refuse to buy any more Tsla without a way to close the contract. Too volatile. So I missed out on the bounce thanks to Friday’s stupidity.
You could have bought a call today. Then when it got to the point that you wanted to sell, you could have sold a different call. One strike higher than the one you bought. That would have locked most of your gains. Then you could close tomorrow. Buy the one you sold and sell the one you bought. At the same time. Don’t do it separately. Unless there is real bad volume.
Yeah I suppose the ghetto call spread would have worked, but Oh well.

Just general nervousness around FINTECH earnings on companies that have run 100%+ since last ER is my guess. It makes sense to take profit if you’re up that much before the uncertain earnings report

The public is stupid
 I need option plays please I’m so down bad
Normally I would say CHWY 80 calls like a month out but it’s not acting right today for the breakout so now I don’t know
Just a hunch, but I think SPY will continue to dive based on Evergrande defaulting and high inflation. Gamble at your own risk.
Puts Wednesday and Friday next week.
Bulls scrambling to click sell sell sell

Its been awhile so maybe they have problem knowing how to sell
Sdc is going to go right back where it was. Definitely over 5 by end of week

Idk how to ban bet
so 465 wasn’t even a support i guess
Now I'm jumping in some draft King leaps
I’ve literally lost on everything I’ve played this week. If you want to make money inverse me. SPY puts, F PUTS, Sofi Puts and Pfizer puts you welcome for the free money
lost an ass load of money on dash yesterday, got it back with spy and dash puts today plus some!
Really like the way the telecoms -- VZ, T, TMUS are starting to behave as this market changes.
What’s your TSLA Put Price target / expiry ??

I had this as a long position. But it's getting difficult to justify.

SPY daily RSI below 30. On such low volume, we could potentially see a nice bump up to 466 today. But I think we've got more red to go after that bump

I think we’re in the manic stage of the cycle.

My irresponsible 2 day out calls is evidence of this
OTLY good entry point with earnings coming up
$ELY is so fuckin undervalued its incredible. Doing so well even during the pandemic
Shut the fuck up butt eater
$OPEN drilling
Look. If you think something is going to pop/rocket/moon then you’re too late. By the time we find out the big whales have already got their teeth in it.
If RH sells your options for you does that count as a day trade?
Yes it does if it results in a day trade
No
If you opened that position on the same day RH auto sells it, yes
Yes, if its 0DTE otherwise they will not.
Is the Lehmann moment in $TSLA over? Is it safe to come out?
Fucks sake. I buy wish calls and it starts drilling straight to core of the earth.
(imagines a -1% day)


no… no.

impossible.

It seems most people here are retarded. How many are down on this spy dump? Also, it'll dump heavy tomorrow or Friday, thats when you buy the calls
I think I am doing theta gang shit? Not big gains but at least some gains.

RIG 3.50 puts printing nicely now broke any type support flush under 3.50
Holy shit RKT puts printing. Up 50%
HOOD doing me dirty

China just can’t help themselves and always has to copy American companies.

They wanted to try a little financial crisis of their own.

I wonder if there is a Chinese Michael Burry 🤔
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

The question is, can you afford not to?
Is it a good idea to buy calls on MRNA now
$DGX Quest Diagnostics finally set up to run again. See previous DDs. And they recently had best earnings vs expectations in company history.
Up a hundred percent on my BYND puts. Do I greed for the potential earnings correction? Was up big on my TTD and DASH puts that got clobbered after earnings post. Someone talk some sense into me.
I bought BYND puts specifically for earnings. We'll see what happens.
Sell most of your puts, and take the chance on the remainder. I think you are right they will whiff, but who knows?
Finally a fucking win by scalping 0DTE spy puts. Wish I had had the diamond hands to hold over the entire inflation drop.
yeah. I made 3K on puts this morning, switched to calls, and then it drilled to the center of the earth. Typical
Is the stock market closing early today before we sell off more ?
Fubo got annihilated. Probably more pain if market goes red tomorrow again. Sofi will probably be next
Someone call me when when another big sell-off starts, this one is boring.
Guess I will not sleep tonight
Do we still like MRNA now
We like Moderna, but not sure if we like the stock market just now...
Lmao the judges ringtone
fuck sofi... what are you doing
Red days fucking suck, but it’s made a bit easier knowing that spy is only down .2% from where it was a week ago. 

I’m not overly concerned about my eoy calls

The 3 P’s
Welcome to the Poop Realm
I just made an order on Uber eats and it didn't ask me to make a tip like usual is that new?

Why is FB down

AXP don’t give no fucks about this dip ✌️ see you pussies at $200+
Paypal a good buy?
I am scared to inverse myself for disney earnings
Barrick and Newmont trying their best to save my portfolio, didn't fucking hedge enough.
Exit my mouse poots +20% or roll the dice on a dump after earnings?
I have very good entry points up 30-45% on some of my stocks the last month or so. I’ve sold my lower gaining ones yesterday and today. With the kick off that’s about to happen should we sell it all?
the federal government posted a deficit of $165 billion in the month of October

I feel old, I remember when our entire annual deficit was less than that lol
Someone please make FB go back up
It will in December
Can any tastyworks users tell me how a net delta can be over 100? I'm having a hard time interpreting that one.

Buy Disney puts for free money
Spy not a bad close huge support this area monster gap in am never fails
Dumped my short dated $TLT puts for a 50% loss. Still have a bunch longer dated puts. Rates have to go up....right?
> I think rates are going to stay low for a long time.
What is a long time? Just curious.
Considering selling my dying calls here and getting in to 460p for Friday
Anthony Noto save us ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
$VLTA calls are gonna print in 2 hrs after earnings
There’s the SAVA dip! Get in while it lasts! 🚀
I guess inflation kills hallucinogen's effectiveness    /s
Sometimes sorrow is the door to peace.
Sometimes heartache is the gift I need.
See it’s not so bad

Dont you dare drop below 50 TOST need you to close above it today
Sofi going boom or bust AH?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
TTCF thoughts?
Does pltr keep dumping tomorrow?
I closed my puts already.  No one ever went broke taking profit.
Amen
DIS earnings. Good or bad?

Tell me so I know what to inverse.
Seems like all earnings have been sold off hard. That's  my bet
Is Cathie Wood buying Rivian, anybody knows?
Think she said it's overvalued. So inverse her and buy
This time, I agree with her.
Who pissed off the market gods?
FOA taking off eod again😂
Sold all of my puts. Happy cash gang until I see an opportunity to jump in.
Hoping INTC breaks 50 so I can add more leaps.
It won’t go lower?
What’s your opinion on Visa right now? Doesn’t it seem like an easy 6%? What do you think?
I don't track that space enough to have an opinion but if I did I would look into why consumer CC debt is increasing this fall and what are the pros/cons for visa. It could be just shoppers getting ahead of the supply chain issue but like I said no idea.
Put 2k on ITM VXX 11/26 puts... will double down by Friday if wrong. BTFD
Or you could just buy spy calls like a normal person
Nah I'd rather bet on something that will go down even if we trade sideways or low vol.
This is boring toodles poodles
sell my december calls or we green tomorrow?
Lil ass bitch
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
That's a great question. We might see a green day tomorrow but it might also be super devil dick red. I would sell them, especially if you're sitting on profit.
I need a PTON lol level earnings for Mickey
Earning plays for today?
Puts on paysafe, I’m just guessing
Hyped to see asian markets later today, needless to say I own puts
BB casually just drops 7% in a day. Like its any ole day.
CLOV too 😔 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Someone tell me why CLOV is going DOWN after good earnings?
Profit taking. Earnings giveth and earnings taketh away
Profit taking on 17 cents of gains?
Look at their subreddit and you’ll get your answer
Picked up MAR 1600c on TSLA, bought when TSLA was around the 1030 mark. Some good gains if I hold, or some good pains if I hold
Apple puts pay so fucking nice but holy shit if Apple doesn’t fall hard tomorrow I’m gonna be pissed
145 is pretty much as far down as it will go short term. If it breaks that, hooollyyy shit
My long positions are in fb and tsm for feb and April. I should be safe 😪
[deleted]

The moral of the story is what you least expect to happen will always happen
I least expect getting laid
Pls go up TASK
GME could get explosive from here. Clearly nobodies selling
If Tesla dips to 1000, do we buy 1000C 3-4 months out?
Going to drop another 100 today
So when do we’re buy tho
$850-920
In dont think it’ll go that low
It will just set your buy order and don’t look at it
When it stops going down.
0831
I think it's going all the way to 420.69
Well well well. Buying gold mining calls before cpi actually paid off for once

Can we just please let Amazon deliver the mail. Bet they can figure it out better. For fucks sake
Or we could just eliminate the 95% of mail that's junk.
I really need Apple to fall a little further tomorrow, overall good day
Labor shortage over.  Biden opened the borders.  Better crawl back to your jobs before Juan and Maria take them.
If your job can be taken by immigrants fleeing their country then you needed a new job anyways.
Imagine being so bad at your job / or having such a shit job that an immigrant who doesn’t speak the language could do it better than you
I am buying as much AMC as I can.  
  
I have no regrets about this, and I don't care what happens. I love the movies, and I love the idea of hollywood NFTs. And AMC's own cryptocurrency? I'm done. I'm all in here. Everything. \*I want to own AMC outright.\*

You're cold and wet. Your standing outside because you don't want to be in your cheap Walmart, Coleman tent with your wife because she's pissed, so your sitting on a cool travel stool, you bought after seeing a tik tok ad, that can fold up really small... its not very comfortable. You were so excited about the "integrated stove"... You even posted a wide mouthed selfie on social media to show people how cool it was. But you left it on when you warmed up your Chocolate Soylent last night. You thought your wife would be impressed by your ingenuity but she said she wished you had just brought some Swiss Miss. She also said she wanted a fire but you told her you didn't need one because you could just do the cooking on the *Rivian Stove!* And honestly, you thought it would be easier to find firewood in the forest. She ended up going to bed early, which was a bummer because you were kind of thinking tent sex would be fun! *Oh well, at least you had time to read the new superman comic that just came out. It's so cool that he's gay now!* You pull your mens LULU lemon jacket tighter. This was supposed to be a fun trip, but **you left the stove on and now your new Rivian is dead.** You told your wife, "look on the Brightside! Your new one+ phone still has service!". You were able to call the local mechanic and he said he could help you out, he does a lot of off-roading and knows the area. You made sure to thank him profusely. *Are you supposed to tip mechanics? I'll just leave him a really nice yelp review*, you think to yourself. Your thoughts are cut short though as you hear the reverberation of a diesel motor, you grows louder and louder until you its loud enough that your wife finally hopes out of the tent. You both look as a white Chevy steadily and swiftly turns a bend. "Huzzah! We're saved!" your wife doesn't think it's funny. *You were just trying to break the awkward silence.* You think \*Doesn't she know its funny because I'm saying it 'Huzzah ironically?\* As the car approaches you start to scramble around, it's a big truck and you want to make sure it can fit next you your Rivian. *I would never get a truck that big. That's why I like the Rivian, it's nice and compact, perfect for driving to the grocery store and running errands.* He pulls up and hopes out of his car. "Hey" he says. He must not have seen you wave because it was directed towards your wife. "Howdy" you say. But you must not have spoken loud enough because he didn't turn around. *Oof, awkward haha.* You stand next to your wife. "You guys need a jump?" He booms out "it definitely looks like you do hahaha!" He gestures to your wife who laughs at the joke. you laugh too, but you don't really understand whats that funny. "So what do you think of my truck!" you blurt out. "I'd be interested in getting a mechanics opinion!" He turns slightly, glancing at the my beloved Rivian."yeah.. that's interesting alright.. Kind of looks like one of those Mini Coopers.""Well it's electric! And it has an integrated stove. And I only have one right now because I was able to get on the preorder lists and it actually goes farther than a tes-""Hey man, that's cool man." he says with a smile "can you show me were to hook up the cables?" you are happy that he think your new Rivian is cool! It takes you about 30 minutes to go through the manual and find out where to hook up the jacks. you probably could have done it faster if Brad had helped, but he him and Stacy were chatting and you never heard a point in the conversation that you could ask your questions without interrupting. Stacy is so nice, she's acting like she's really interested when Brad is telling her about some of the things he does with his truck. But you know she's not really interested in that stuff because she's told you before. Your deal is that you get 10 minutes a day to talk about car stuff (which is hard because you know a lot about Rivian!) haha. "Alrighty!" you say. Oops, you should have waited for there to be a lull in the conversation, they're looking at you awkwardly.  You show Brad were to put the cables. Once they're hooked up Brad starts his car and revs the engine repeatedly. "So loud!" you say, as you cover your ears with your cupped hands. *I wonder if that absolutely necessary* you think. That's the beauty of the Rivian; It's so quiet. you turned to explain that to Stacy but she was already heading towards Brads truck. *Is she going to ask him to be more quiet? I hope he doesn't get mad.* He Rolls down the window and chats with her for a second, you can't hear because even just idling his truck is annoyingly loud. He pops the driver side door open and you see him scoot over and Stacy hopes in. She starts revving the engine and it's even louder. you wait for a second then walk towards the car. you knock on Stacy's window and she glances over at you, she looks for the button as she continues to talk to Brad. She must not have found it because Brad had to reach over her and press it. The window starts to roll down "-- and yeah, you're totally right. It does kind of vibrate haha... Yes honey?""What up, man?" Brad says."It's kind of loud-- do you have-- Sorry, it's kind of loud out here. Do you think I can come in too?""Sorry, the back is full of my tools and some hunting gear I haven't put away yet.""Why don't you start packing up your little tent, Honey?""That's a good idea!" You emphasize it with finger guns because you don't really want them to know that you're kind of disappointed they're not letting you in the truck. As you walk away the the revving of the diesel engine continues. you can barely hear Stacy's laugh as she closes the window. The tent was kind of hard to put away so You just stuff it in the back of the Rivian, it fits really nicely in the compact bed. Brad finishes up with the cables, throwing them onto the back seat of his truck. "Are we all set?" You ask."well, it looks like you have about 30 miles in this thing right now. That should get you to the Tesla charging station at the next rest area.""hmmm, I don't know if that will work.. can we maybe charge it off your truck a little m--""Nah, I have something I need to do. I'm sure you can make it work. You seem really.. techy about all this.""Oh.. alright. Stacy, are your ready to go?" I kind of have to shout because she's next to Brads truck. She walks over to us. "Actually, Brad was nice enough to offer me a ride back to our home. It turns out he needed to go that way anyway. Isn't that crazy haha? You'll be fine though, right? You were telling me you can watch movies on the screen in your little truck while you charge it? You can keep watching that one show, the one with the subtitles. Don't worry about watching ahead of me, I'm don't really understand what's going on in it anyway.""Oh, I thought you said you like Squid Game..." *She would probably understand it more if she just got off her phone when we watched. I had to explain the political symbolism to her because I don't think she really got it. Maybe it would be easier if we watched the dubbed version but it waaay more authentic if you just use subtitles.* "Yeah, okay, yeah.. I guess that works.. it will take a while to charge though.. Like hours." Brad was picking up her duffle bag, and they both started towards the truck. "That's fine babe. That actually works out great because I think I'm going to take a nap. Al this camping really took it out of me. Maybe if I'm still awake I can make you up some of that vegan mac and cheese you like, maybe. Thanks babe, I really need to get home and lay down, I'm feeling kind of warm." *That's not good!* I thought. *It's freezing out, I hope she's not getting sick!* "Oh, okay Stace.. if your not feeling well, maybe I can rub your feet or something when I get back.""Yeah, maybe!" She shouted as she closed the door. The Engine came to life again. You step aside as Brad puts it in reverse then starts to take off. Stacy glances at You and you blow her a kiss. She smiles and gives me a quick wave. Before you lose them in the trees. *Shoot! I forgot to tell her I love her! I'll text her really quick.* She must not have cell service because she doesn't reply. *Dumb iPhones lol.* It's really quiet now, and the light is kind of hitting your new truck in a really artsy way. I take a selfie with it and and the caption 'had a great time camping with my truck and Stacy! Looking forward to doing it again if anyone wants to join! #electric4life #future #cool.' You hop in and push the start button and hear a two little \*beeps as it dash panel comes to life. You slowly, back out and start to drive out of the forest. *I wonder if Brad was kind of jealous of my new truck? I'd definitely choose my truck over his any day. I just really like science and futuristic things so this truck really matches my personality. I feel really  good when I'm driving it... I wonder if Stacy will feel in the mood to have sex when I rub her feet. I should have asked to rub her back, I think that's more sensual....I*

Bromance is real
Can we make it a yearly year-end event where everyone sells 50% of their portfolio to rocket GME in Dec?        😈🚀
Amazon badly missed earnings and its mooning, wtf?
I know, right.  UPST nailed it, and took a dive.
VIX is starting to calm down, looks like the market is finish digesting the inflation report shock and has priced in. I'm expecting a slight flatness or maybe recovery today.
That's what I get for not getting in early enough to peruse WSJ before the market opens, thanks for the info. 

Hilarious that Tesla is up 5% though, "the economy is fucked! Quick buy more shares of this absurdly overpriced luxury car company!"
TSLA please go red. The entire market is depending on you.

thoughts on SOFI tanking?
I wrote covered calls so thank god
GIVE ME MORE RED. Been waiting to buy since the last dip. This is not red enough.
And you’ll probably miss this one too as you wait for and miss the dip
I didn’t miss the last one. Made a killing on Spy buying calls in the sub 430s. Need spy to drill to 440s/450s would be juicy
Lmao!!! Bears rekt!
da fuck u looking at
CLOV looking real good y'all! Get ready for rocket ship!!!!
I think you have your chart upside down
I’ve been saying we will see 450s this week or the next. Keep downvoting me your calls will burn.

The reality is stocks go up. Get rekt
You stupid fucks said I shouldn’t buy the SDC dip yesterday. I’d be up 10% on shares alone

21 billion shares of Tesla that Elon M going to sell it’s tremendously amount of money that it’s not good idea for me to touch it again. If that is millions I probably buy after a month but billion is significantly large amounts. It’s suck !!! Oh well
Who says he is going to sell it all at once?
Some of those are words yes
Wut
Eh it depends on what he does with the money. Stock was overbought and if I were him I would do the same.

Why would you ever go on seeking alpha?

Yeah… the metaverse bubble is nothing like the tech bubble of the 90s…
This EV bubble’s gonna be fun to watch
sofi puts is free money
they hate him because he spoke the truth
Ready for WISH
I hope amd drills farther than my hopes were for nvda
Ahh the good ole bull gone bear for a day trap.
Just for the day
Bottom is in on AFRM. You’re welcome. 🚀

Downvote me but was I wrong thoo
Y’all stop shilling NVDA. It was doing so well until apes found it
Dude wsb has been on NVDA for the past 2 years or more.
No
No, 78.
Yeah...they couldn't get it

yo cigarette and booze companies must be shoving trillions up politicians’ asses because as far as i can tell 


legalizing the green stuff would be remarkably popular

and yet neither side had budged 

i need me a seat in the senate so my TLRY calls will print
Pharma and maybe booze. Tobacco came pretty late to the party, but they'd just make it a new revenue stream.
MO is investing massive amounts into marijuana, so I don't know what you are on about.
why is weed still illegal?

u have 30 minutes. go.


how is what i said complicated?
Because Christian conservatives still vote in droves.  


What does that have to do with my answer?  MO is the largest tobacco company in the US and they are putting massive amounts of money into marijuana, so why would they torpedo it?
I said tobacco companies when I should’ve said pharmaceutical companies



You’re wrong on conservative christians being a force to reckon with


not on weed anymore

it’s remarkably popular


It’s definitely the money, idk exactly where to point though
Jesus still no rivian ipo
dril drill DRILL DRILL more more MORE MORE. not enuff

Calls on $RGR in anticipation of Rittenhouse verdict, if he is found innocent i think there will lots of riots again

Edit: not saying he will or will not, this is not political, but Ruger is an awesome unrest play. I am gambling on people being pissed off by the outcome, most likely regardless of what it is.
FB bear trap this week. We still hitting ATH this year
Don’t get cute with China stocks. The hang sang is already down 60% peak to trough. China has already been in a bear market. You buy bear market bottoms, not sell.
normally true

but that shit is barely a market when the president-for-life tanks entire industries to take out political enemies

US market is rigged for the entire population, CCP market is rigged for one man
Don’t look at it that way, China is not going anywhere and they will be here 50 years in the future. We don’t like their system but they still have a system.
Might be contagious, the linch pin to a larger pull back and the greatest buying opportunity in 20 years

> Supply chain issues are because of the explosion in demand. But to drop demand you have to make it so people can't afford shit.
demand > supply = higher inflation
Actually, quantity demanded is directly tied to how expensive things are. It's why you can't keep raising prices on a product and still make money, even if there are no substitutions (unless you hold a basic human need). Even things like steel and lumber have a limit, as we saw during the height of the cost of those things (homebuilders weren't able to complete or start new projects and still make money)
Raising prices is how you lower demand.

Man nextdoor really is one of a $KIND
My experience with Nextdoor is getting e-mails with critical alerts about criminal activity, only to click on it to read the supposedly 300 comments and find that the message thread has been deleted, probably because the perpetrators were minorities and someone's Ring cam caught it on video.

I live in a neighborhood where the question, "Were those fireworks or gunshots?" is at best a 50/50 on any given night.  Probably leaning toward the gunshots because who the fuck lights off fireworks in November?

I don't know what their monetization model is, but there's zero chance this website exists in 5 years.

If ever there was a time to go short volatility, it is now.
Good volatility ticker?
For realized volatility, any are too late to make a move. For implied, they're too far ahead to use reliably. Just a feeling I get in my one remaining brain wrinkle. Extremely short term.

For clarification: I'm not talking about VIX, but selling strangles.
I'm so horny
Support at 100 is strong
I hate fucking dips
Investing in these EV companies at these values is ultimate cringe. You know how crowded the space is now? This is exactly like the telecom bubble and yet people are jumping in to be the greater fool. It’s cringe.
Wait to be a bear until after the EV bubble pops like fintech did.  Until then stfu no one cares about your edgelord shit, we bubble riding

Do I take my BMBL Puts profit or let it ride into the sunset for ER today...
JMIA is on the launch pad rumbling... about to take off.
It has already hit the bottom of the YTD cup
thats forming (sitting currently at the bottom of the Cup that will start to take shape) -the move up will happen at any time now- likely with a jump to $23-$24 by EOW or beginning of next week (as it tend to run up into earnings):
A critical mass of retail investors will start jumping back on board the next couple of days...

(Due to JMIA being still in high growth &
high future growth stage- as the sort of
SAMZN of Africa- it will trade off of Broad
technical sentiments and continued
strategic moves & deal.. rather than short
term financial metrics - just as AMZN did
earlier on).

JMIA has an insanely low market cap- any
way you look at its leadership in Africa E-
commerce & the huge digital growth Africa
is starting to move into. (thats the
sentiment behind the stocks broad
technicals - which have this pointing
towards another huge move similar to this
time last year!
Dude. They're priced at 10x sales right now, I'd say that's pretty generous for a company that hasn't grown in 12 months. I hope your bags aren't too heavy because this is not going anywhere soon.

Anybody get the feeling there might be another F selloff this morning or do y'all think we got another day in between?
Spends on Rivian
F is heavily invested in Rivian, over $1bn iirc. That's why I'm worried of a selloff, in the event that Rivian doesn't pump. But F also had really good earnings not too long ago. I bought F calls to be ready because I don't do IPOs but I'm getting nervous lol.
Gold is moving. Very scary but im happy the truth gets out , but its not pretty .

My DISCA leaps <3 , only play I followed Michael Burry on because I'm bullish on HBO and he got a big ass position on it
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

Alright guys. So I bought F calls at open $20 strike, to prepare for Rivian IPO. They expire 12/3 (-28%) and 12/23 (-35%). Can't sell today because I used all my day trades. Sell at open or hold?

All of my "best" plays this quarter have been selling shit stocks after losing a lot of money on them but before losing even more. A 30% loss that could have been a 55% loss is technically a 25% gain, right?

The best part about WSB is you can just schizo-post any idea you have and they just let you do it.

Reminder that apes legitimately believed that the 65 year old CEO of a multinational company intentionally showed his hairy naked legs during a live interview as some sort of signal/dog whistle 

The same apes who legitimately believe the same man is selling all of his vested shares for $25m simply for estate planning after they ran up 1700% in value.

These same apes STILL believe after all this that there is a “squeeze” on the horizon. Don’t worry wsb you might be fucking morons, but compared to most you’re all Gordon fuckin Gekko

Wtf is a bond and where do people even get them

Sounds fake tbh
My life is meaningless from the hours of 4:00pm to 9:30am.
When someone asks what you do, dont say

"Buy and Sell Equity insurance contracts." 

Sounds more professional.
The "Fuck off vegans" post with the Beyond Meat put gains is the most comedic thing I've seen this month so far. Savage VisualMod comments are next

What are the odds that a real serial killer is part of this sub
I just want a lot of money. Not a modest amount. I want to get weird with it. I want to make people question their morals just by being in the same room as me. I want buzzfeed to put me on a list of the most evil people on earth, then a week later put me on a list of people you'd definitely fuck. I want laws to stop applying to me, and I want it in writing. I want to own things that are worth more than I'm currently worth and just not even know about it. I want to party on someone else's yacht in Monaco and have people be like "why is he slumming it here?" Of all the shitty hands to be dealt in life, not being born a Saudi prince really stings.
My plan tomorrow: watch market rips, FOMO buy at the top, watch it dump hard, go to home depot ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)

Shitposting volume is low imo
I decided to challenge myself and I put half my money in an etf account I didn't touch and half in a fun account where I traded daily. It's been about a year. My trading account is basically at 0% gains. The ETF one is like 25%.

Theta gang going to be charged with war crimes after how choppy today was
Writing itm put options on shares you borrowed, with a downpayment funded by a cash out refi of your home, seems like a great idea.
To make sure I understand, people want stocks like TSLA to split so even more call options will be bought at lower premiums and the stock goes up even more on something that for 100 years has been an accounting move and generates no actual shareholder value.
So today marks another were the lack of intellect from most traders are on full display.

People keep asking why more of WSB isn't on the Rivian ipo. Simple:

No options idiot.

(Not to mention how all but one car ipo has burned people here in the last two years.)
Lol did PSFE invent cancer and kill god? Those poor holders
The girl I’ve been having sexual intercourse with just said she bought a shower curtain rod at BBBY. I would never do that but it’s gotta be bullish.
Pissed my 300 paysafe shares bought at 4.21 not 4.20, the whole fucking point of that trade was for the meme. My day is ruined.
Are people for real with this Rivian shit? It almost feels like every EV IPO attracts people who’ve never once bought anything in their life before and are just throwing cash around
So spy 470 tomorrow ??

Please let it be the greenest fucking day for tech tomorrow
Saying RIVN is worth $105 Billion market cap, more than $F and $GM based on what could potentially happen in the future....you can literally fucking say that about any company. Here goes: I think $DWAC will be the future $FB because Trump has dedicated followers. Therefore I'm gonna value it a little more than $FB NOW which would make it $6,070 a share. That's literally the exact same fuckin logic.
hardest part is learning to wait. 99% of people here fail because they think they know more than they do and they are always trading. you need to stare at charts and read all the news and financial data and then wait and wait and wait and wait until there's something for you to trade.
Rivian worth more than Ford after making about 5 trucks, makes complete sense

Holy shit, here's a comment from the AMC sub 

"It won't be a one day thing. If the algo cycle theory is true, next week we run up to $100-150. And the week after that will be the peak of the cycle where we rip to $250s+.

This is just the next leg up for amc. Whether these prices trigger failed margin calls and start the moass though, is a different story. If these prices don't, it will be another 5 months (april ish) where our next leg up will be if people continue to buy and hold."

I think 99% of the people who created brokerage accounts after March 2020, and made money from meme stonks, are gonna lose a lot of it.

Anyone ever notice SPY is inverse cocaine ounce prices?  I could be on to something here, but when covid first started and SPY plummeted, the price of an ounce of cocaine reached  $2790, highest I’ve ever seen.  Whole time I was being told it’s a pandemic supply chain issue.  

Just as SPY made its V shape recovery, the price of a ounce of coke slowly trended down, magically erasing the supply chain issue, making that ounce of coke $1100.  

When a ounce of coke goes up, we are entering bear market, price goes down we are bull.  Use this information wisely
Priuses are so great for the environment. I’d rather walk than be seen driving one.

I sold a $43 covered call expiring tomorrow when it dropped last week after the first pop off. This stock has done nothing but disappoint me since I got caught bag holding 6 months ago. For a while I was starting to be convinced it was a RIDE/NKLA scam. Now that the price is finally going up it's STILL disappointing me. I'm just going to let the shares get called away. It will still be at a profit and leave me with 50 shares. It's about fucking time I make some money off this asshole stock.

Is it just me to think that once the F150 lightning comes out Rivian is fucked?

Ford has the production capability, the distribution system, an existing customer base, a better product (opinion) at a much better price point. Rivian can’t compare.
My thoughts exactly. Wish I could buy puts on RIVN right now.
No… not now.

Maybe right before lockup?
Ford's products might also be trash, plus they have way more built in expense due to all of their debt and existing facilities and labor. Ford has some good things going for it along with plenty of awful things and you have to hope it's net positive. 

In the end, they aren't competing with Rivian, they are competing with everyone else. Rivian has no proven products or production capacity.
Explain the market cap discrepancy though. No way that is reasonable. Either Rivian is over priced or Ford is under priced or both.

Now, comparing to TSLA… it’s more reasonable the TSLA valuation because we see lots of things happening… improved production, infrastructure being developed, IP being developed… we see TSLA having issues and resolving them for the most part. Issues Rivian is going to have to go through. I think it’s way too early for the stock to be priced so high, specially with 0 products delivered.

Let’s not also forget the cyber truck and the electric hummer.
We're in the biggest market bubble since the housing bubble pre-Great Recession fueled by pandemic disruptions, obscene amounts of new and essentially free money, and the most access to financial markets that idiots have ever had.

There is no basis for Rivian's ridiculous valuation. There isn't even a good justification for Ford's current valuation given their balance sheet and lack of products. 

Tesla's valuation isn't really because it's some good company with good products--it's just a meme factory with capital flows that operate on game theory while also serving as a proxy for investment into more transformative things like Starlink and SpaceX.
Honestly I think the stonk market bull run is fueled by corporations and wealthy people hoarding cash. Inflation, by design, made it unfavorable to hoard cash and alll the hoarded cash is going to equities because it’s a safer store of value. Specifically equities with international exposure.

As for Starlink and SpaceX, I am not sure to what extent TSLA is invested if at all. I know Google has a stake.

I feel that Tesla’s valuation might be fair and Ford is not valued correctly. I feel that equities truly reflect the state of inflation and that inflation in terms of CPI is being subsidized to keep low.

Tin foil hat time: I feel that inflation happening was intentional to solve a couple of things, not just to stimulate shit during COVID, I feel that it is related to locked up corporate cash and to address high US labor costs.
Near-zero interest rates, huge expansion of the money supply, and the government purchasing of corporate bonds have made  the stock market pretty much the only show in town for capital looking for any yield whatsoever in the developed world. 

There has been an almost complete refusal to price any sort of risk by capital markets (aside from lenders for lodging/hospitality real estate), and it's caused so many asset prices to explode. It's going to end badly for many.

IMO none of the car companies are being priced accurately, with them all being too high.
Ford long run, Rivian short term and down. Ford is better looking 💯
Ford is still my favorite auto stock. The next 5 years will be interesting as the get into electric and also the commercial fleet data services where it’s almost all profit. I’m hoping in the next year they increase dividends and announce a stock buyback because it’s so diluted currently. I could easily see it doubling again. I grabbed 15k shares at $6 and plan on holding it for 5+ years.
I’ve been on the fence with Ford. I was once bullish on them and lost faith but now I’m coming around again.

It needs to sell more outside the US.

Meanwhile I feel that the giants have been way too quiet waiting in the sidelines to see how the upstarts to Tesla are gonna fuck up so they can take notes.

Those giants being Toyota and Volkswagen AG
I’d rather jack off than get head from a fat girl. 

At least when I cum from jacking off to some sick fantasy I have to deal with my shame alone. But when you cum and look at the land whale in front of you you feel utterly worthless lol

We all have that one whale hunt in our closet of bad decisions…
Never been harpooning?! It’s more fun than it looks.
I did once and that’s where my conviction to not do it again comes from
To each his own, I guess. The first whale I bagged had super good drugs, we were at a Pretty Lights show, she took me home to her pool, she snorted drugs off my boner, and the rest is history.
> I'm pretty sure it's more fun than it looks.
Tomorrow’s gonna be green and absurdly so. This is my postradamus.
You sure about that big dawg?
I am. The comment said so.
It is written (in the above post).
You got reasons?
A hunch. And a prophecy.
SNDL price target adjusted to $15!?!?!

 u/69PutsOnYourPuts69 (0/1) made a bet that INMD would go to 100.0 when it was 87.8 and it did not. They were automatically banned for two weeks.

To get out early they have to: 'or i'll shave and eat my beard trimmings.

The get out early clause has been satisfied! I can confirm that u/69PutsonyourPuts69 , did indeed consume beard hair, by drinking it in a massive shot of tequila 🥃!
Look Ma! I'm famous!

Edit, lmao at the platinum and gold, I love you but I've been banned from r/lounge on 2 accounts already
Seriously impressive 😳

SNDL about to go crazy
Rational?
AH already as green as the day
F to DIS Earnings Call Bagholders, I’m with you now but at about 90% less than what you paid 😂 with that being said DIS 170 tomorrow
I did 170 for next week. Felt like such a fucking steal
Hopefully after earnings lol, but yeah I agree historically DIS has never sustained a dip this large. But that was when Iger was running the show, Chapek seems to be an asshat so we will see
Got f'fd by the mouse
This earnings season has not been fun
fr I got burned on every trade
Same :(
Mouse is fired from Dow index.
Tesla up down up down
i cant tell whether to be happy or sad about my ride puts
same boat... got a notification "Ride down -5% AH..." open app +2%...
Same. I'm expecting to get nuked, so anything that doesn't result in nukage is a good thing?
Why did I think the stock market was closed today 🥺 there go my weekly calls
bond market was closed, equities open
VIX crush Friday about to destroy some portfolios tomorrow.
This earnings season has me hating life.
I still can’t believe amd was the cost of a sandwich 2 years ago fuck my lyf
how many of you is shopping on WISH for $ROPE?
And it'll still be Chinese shitty hemp when I get it
I don’t think these SPY 471 calls are gonna print tomorrow guys
It can still happen!
I’ve been shitting non stop for a few days now. Puts on my hot fiery ass hole
💩 sup?
Bruh, I’m good on earnings. I don’t fuck with this shit anymore.
Sitting and watching paint dry since I am long and holdn.
Why aren’t more people in here on the RIVN train? Does that mean we’re not at top/ WSB FOMO levels yet?
I feel like every IPO starts the same. Goes insane right when it hits the market. Over the course of a couple week especially when options comes out it reaches the peak again and maybe farther and just a steady decline after that
This. You're a dumbass to be in it right now outside of quick day trades.
Yeah that’s true, but most ipos that get pumped here have been SPACs
Saw a CNBC segment where the analyst was saying they are more than twice as overvalued as Tesla. If CNBC is saying that we’re going to 1000!
Lmao 100 shares at $100 avg wish me luck

I’ve been waiting for this IPO for years I will quadruple down if I have to
No options yet.
$RIDE puts lookin guuuuud 🤑
Was a fun RIDE, made enough to sustain my top ramen and malt liquor habit through the weekend, tomorrow’s move, make enough to afford a blow job tomorrow, life is good:)
I bought a shitload of poots dawg. You convinced me lol
I need JPow to save me
$WISH bagholders are fucking hilarious over at Yahoo finance, they're suggesting shareholders actually buy more Wish products to support the company lmfao, like holding the shares of that shitfest alone isn't enough.
Goddamn, and I thought our morons were bad
the twitter wishful thinkers were saying it was on track to compete with amazon. bagholding warps the brain.
these guys must be inhaling plenty of asbestos that arrive with their wish products
This is why you use terminal not yahoo finance. Not that many 🤡 have $25k to fk off on a software subscription that goes to a former presidential candidate.
yeah I just watch that shitshow for entertainment, 0 signs of intelligence anywhere

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/DiamondHanded (0/1) made a bet that GRWG would go to 18.0 when it was 23.95 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
I just want to make enough on SPY calls to buy a McRib combo and get a 2nd McRib for $1.
heard that GM is breaking out.. Would be fun to see it at high 60s !
I just read a article how Manchin opposes ev tax credit for union car companies...
that's gonna happen in America. Government got the back of the unions.
not for coal loving Manchin. Toyota is already bitching up a storm about it.
Better price than 100 billion dollar EV startups.
yep but I also got some 100b and 70b EV start ups as well :)
It feels like a fucking 1 in the morning outside but it is only 5pm…
DIS calls a few weeks out, yes.
I grabbed a march 22 call but it should gap up next week
What strike if you don’t mind me asking
180. Not to far OTM but enough delta to move it if it gaps up to 170 in next 1-2 weeks.
Thanks for the feedback, am going 12/03 strike $170.

??? F has been on a great run.  Where you a year  ago?
Never managed to understand the WISH investment play. I was a wish customer exactly one time, out of curiosity. That was all the DD I needed to never even ironically considering it. Who are these people that bought WISH after the last ER?
CEO stepped down cuz he sucks at his job

New CEO = positive future outlook

Super easy

And I don’t own any of it
There is no new CEO. After a new one would be announced, I guess a desperate average down from holders would make some sense (although with the state of their finances I wouldn't), but buying now is a bit pointless. They don't even know when the guy (that they kept hiping for months btw but now hate) actually leaves. They don't know if they even find anybody willing to do the job. It's all a bit nutty.
Bought 100@ 4.98 for shits and giggles. Hoping for a quick 100 (20%) and dump it lol

My portfolio took a beating…contemplating buying some $nvda and pray. 

And if that doesn’t work, I came upon a YouTube video about guys working as “hosts” in japan, making hundreds of thousands of dollars flirting with women (and more). I’ll use whatever remaining money I have for language lessons and a plane ticket when borders open.
Honestly NVDA on any dip is a buy. Always bounces

I have to imagine Bill Foley moved Paysafe’s ER 1 day back to veterans day so the market was open but banks were closed, and everyone got margin called and couldn’t get any money and had to sell their shares, and next week we see Blackrock and Goldman Sachs bought all the cheap shares. No idea it just feels true and I’m blindly going all in.
That’s a very interesting theory
I feel it in my plums. I can read through the fucking matrix. This means go all in. I took a loan on my 401k. I don’t know why, I just know when you see something weird you take a chance.

Trillions of transactions a day vs tens of thousands 

Use that brain bud
Not sure what your point is
You aren’t using that fucken brain…. God dammit I’m giving you the formula, the inputs, and solving it for you.

Come on.

That brain of yours. It has to work.

You made it this far in life, I’m assuming it was because of something other than divine intervention
I'm not so sure of that assumption. Anyways millions of transactions controlled by algorithms unless built in with a fail safe would trigger a flash crash more intense than that of one previous. So I'm assuming there is a fail safe and nothing is going to happen unless they let it
Try trillions

Trillions of transactions

Not petty millions. The sheer volume is your fail safe.

For every seller, there is a buyer.

Flash Crashes literally can’t occur anymore. And a real crash, is 30% off SPY in half an hour.

That’s a crash
Okay but are you taking into account real life factors or are we just pretending the market is detached from reality still. Cause yeah there are buyers but there's still uneven pressure. The dollar continues to lose value, you're going to have to continue to pump more and more money into an asset that in numerical value is increasing but the actual equity of the share isn't because the underlying fiat is degrading.
Just the US, there was a lot of talk about OPEC 'breaking the back' of the dollar.  We showed them fuckers, though, at one point in the 90's the infant mortality rate in Iraq was 20%
I’m so alone. Someone give me bedtime story
Once there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly that everyone died. The end.
God tier response
That hit home
Felt that one in my shell.
Shit you beat me to it
Let me tell you a tale of a day long bygone.

Once upon a time there was a man. He was born to humble beginnings but he came to the court of the Greenspan, who said "Get thee to the NBER with the Feldstein and learn my trickle down ways, so mote it be." And so it was that the Bernank was with the Feldstein at the NBER. And the trickle-down was learned, even as it was delivered unto the hand of the prophet Ayn Rand. And the evening and the morning were the second day.

Then lo, the Bernank ascended the throne of Greenspan at the turn of the tide. And the Bernank said lo, the wealth-esteem of the people is failing; and the people grow wroth, and their countenance falls; and they spendeth not. And so it was. And the Bernank wrought a mighty wizardry, and discovered the housing-effect. And he grabbed the Rate and by main force he wrestled the Rate until the Rate was smote down unto the ground and utterly ruined.

And the housing-effect lifted all countenances, and the rising tide lifted all boats, and lo, the rates were lo, and the housing-effect was made good. And the evening and the morning were the third day.

And lo, the printers went brrr, but the people knew the sound not. And they mistook it for a helicopter, dropping money from the sky. It was thus and in that time that the Bernank became known as the Helicopter Ben. And the rates were low, and the borrowers sub-prime, and the mortgages adjustable. And the Helicopter Ben flew over the land, and all who received the money dropping rejoiced in him. And the morning and the evening were the fourth day.

Then the Bernank contemplated what he had wrought; yet he found it not pleasing. And he looked upon the New Century, and the Nova Star, and the Bear Stearns, and with every glance that he took, the Bernank's countenance fell. And he strode to Wall St., and grabbed hold of the rug, and over consecutive quarters gave it a most terrible and mortal yank. The Dick Fuld was cast down, and the NovaStar went out, and the New Century fell into its mortal ruin.

Ever after men did not use the name of Helicopter Ben. And it was preferred not to speak of him, but when it was done, he was called The Bernank. And in the fullness of days JPow arose and took up the mantle of the Bernank, and the printers went brrrr. And the morning and the evening of the day the printers stopped were the seventh day.

Consider that big money knew inflation would drive share prices higher which is why everything has already doubled since inflation began, and now inflation is priced in.

12. Buls R Fuk
That's definitely the logical **Chapter 11**, pun intended

I’m not gonna lie I’ve made great returns and some life changing ones, but this shit is a revolving circle, up 50k one day down 75 the next, up 80k down 120k the next trade. I’m about done with options and my get rich quick scheme, signing out y’all love ya, my last positions expire tmrw.
See you on Monday!
Lol
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
We've all said this before. Just put a big chunk into SPY and start YOLOing with $10k.
Every other week I will need a fresh crisp new 10k and I’ll take it from the long term positions?
So relatable. It stresses me out
What else are you going to do with your free time?
> I'm going to do some options trading and futures trading.
Oof

I’m no expert on bond market and how it interacts w stonks….but wouldn’t a bank holiday be priced in?
Wasn't SPY flat?

Lol you think the fed is restricted by the consumer bond market.
Lol you don’t understand how bonds trade
Maybe this strategy of picking random stocks isn’t working
No, no, you just need to get more random
Ha right!? I got gouged by Paysafe today and was thinking exactly the same. Easier to invest in a fucking index fund and stop watching tickers all goddamn day
Are you lost?
Uh oh. I’ve been spotted. Better hurry back to r/investing
how does that work?
ELON IF YOU CAN HERE ME I WILL NEVER BUY A TESLA UNLESS TSLA HITS $1250 TOMORROW YOU DINGUS

I fucking hate you
[How you remind me of someday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIKbMGnWOxw)
Everyone hates but yet we all know the lyrics…
Puts on your musical taste. 

But I’ll admit that Nickleback had one banger and then EVERY song they did sounded exactly the fucking same.
Bro we all know like all the words to most their songs, it’s a fact.
Ppl hate it cuz they listen to it being heart broken and brings the sad times. But yeah he got some bangers
The haters here used to listen to nickelback in the sony walkman at one time
The nostalgia hits so hard every time I listen to them
Look at this photograph

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Control_the_Guh (0/1) made a bet that RICK would go to 80.0 when it was 71.4 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Wow DIS down by as much as 7%. That's huge for DIS. It's like UPST being down 20%.
BLNK 🙌
Yeah baby - big hulk off
Big balls little brain if you held calls
Boring ass day, bought some TSLA 1tdes to spice my friday up
my dad started really well since i was holding BYND puts.. slowly i lost 20% of the profits,took a break and bought 4x TSLA 1100 1dte. will be fun fosure tomorrow
Rolling the dice!
Huhuh same
I just bought 45 0dtes and I feel like I want to throw up. 


How do you guys do this every week?? This feels AWFUL.
Step 1) enjoy pain
Why do it if you feel awful?
Because I have a good chance of making profit?
Because I actually have some idea of what I'm doing and I have conviction in my plays but that's all gay fairytale shit to y'all
Ayo, wtf? Wish literally just shitcanned their CEO yesterday, they are bleeding cash, and the stock is up 7% today??
They wish they had two CEOs to fire
So many RIDE bears, makes my calls feel safe. If not feel free to come back and mock me if the earnings call is garbage.
Welp, I'm just buying puts cause the calls were super expensive
Ahh yes there we go RIDE
Will my CPNG calls print?
Bad day for me.  Lets see if I can really fuck it up tomorrow...
You got this, I'm going for 5 red days in a row myself

Is it best to elect to max out your HSA. The max is $2400. ?
You should definitely max it out. I've set up a system with the bank that manages it to move any amount over 2K into an investment account, and made almost 3 grand in additional growth over the last two years. Nothing special, but that compounding will pay huge when you retire
Good. Should I pay it once or semi monthly?
I think that's a matter of personal preference? I have my employer take out a fixed amount on each of my pay days, and I get paid biweekly. Easier to set it and forget it versus actively transferring the money
There’s an option to withdraw it once from my paycheck and then there’s bi weekly option
Oh, then do it biweekly. A one time draw might be a bit much, but it does get you into the market sooner
Max out and invest. Don’t touch it for 30 years
The HSA is actually thought to be one of the best investment tools for your retirement. Comes out pre-tax and then as long as you spend on medical stuff, out tax-free.
Hsa for poor millenials only
Yes
$3,600 max for individuals.  Max that shit out.  Fucking triple tax leveraged, one of the best retirement vehicles out there
Sndl reported?

I hadn’t looked at Disneys chart in a while but damn it really hasn’t done shit in just about the whole last year. More sideways than Amazon.

Last time I traded it was from like 190 to 200 on a run up to earnings after which it fell back a bunch and I just forgot about it. Thank god I didn’t try to dip buy on that piece of shit
RIP that dude that yolod his portfolio on DIS 250s
I’ve been DCA’ing for 6months. This is a company that will be around in 50 years.

I mean yeah, I don’t think it’s going bankrupt anytime soon but there are so many better places to put your money even on a 1y+ time horizon. Let it prove to you it’s done sulking and falling backwards and THEN trust it with your money. Until then you’re just catching the knife
Before Disneys jump from 90 - 140 when Disney+ got announced Disney has always been a sideways stock
When is sndl call?  Need something to
Listen to on the way home
Tomorrow am

Pretty sure it was, not sure when they moved it back, only noticed when I checked my calls on Wed
Apparently it's been moved to 10 AM tomorrow?

Really glad i didnt yolo 1dte spy poots today
I see the whole inflation thing has been solved shortly after markets closed. More new ATHs incoming.
Losing more than 10%-15%+ because of miss earnings isn't normal and you got stocks going down fking 30-45% because of it. These type of drops usually only happens if they committed fraud (excluding biotech which is a coinflip). This market is funny AF and it's going to end badly. Those paysafe retards lost 45% by diamond handing through earnings.
Exactly.  I honestly give up.  TA only works sometimes. I just try to ride the waves now and swing trade. If a company beats or misses earnings, it's 50/50 if it goes up or down either way.  

This system is so whack.

I often laugh at apocalypse preachers claiming that This market is unsustainable! The end is near!

Until a detail caught my attention. My  awesomely green, arguably vaporware Rivian stock have a market cap of 1,54 Ford. Don't get me wrong, I will dance as long as the music keeps going but this will be one hell of an hangover. I always have some Clamato in the fridge, I'm not that worried.
Rivian is basically NKLA with a couple prototypes that move under their own power vs just rolling down hills
you are dancing in a room without clocks

All that bear talk about the bond market. Looks totally fine
I’ve discovered how to make money, or lose less.  Whenever I buy calls and they are plummeting, I quickly buy an equal amount of puts.  Sell the puts end of day, and repeat process next day until the original calls get a bounce up, and then sell those
Lol
Isn't this called Stangling Options? Also gives you the opportunity to make money both ways. I think that would have done well w/ BYND today.
I don’t know if this is some official strategy with a name.  I just know it worked for me today with CHWY.  I didn’t profit overall but I mitigated most of the loss from the calls and ended up losing very little
Can’t remember if that’s just a standard strangle or straddle. I always confuse the two.

Its drywall repair time for my DIY renovation to sell this house. 

Calls on HD, puts on my walls. Youtube teaching me drywalling in “theory” appears easy.
It's really easy. I thought it was going to be difficult and ended up be embarrassingly easy.
Ok, feeling better about this project.
It’s easy

Use standard joint compound (red box)

Make it semi-smooth as you aren’t a goddamn sculptor or artist

Wait 2 days for it to fully dry. Trust me, 2 fucken days

Sand, then prime. You’ll see the fucked places. 

Add more mud to smooth, wait 2 days, sand. Prime.

Congrats. Now you are a fucken pro and it will be perfect
If I just have a few areas to fix up, just use compound or should I get a whole sheet of sheet rock to fix it like I’ve seen “California patch” method???

I think one of my holes is on an exterior wall where baseboard is right next to a door. Its not large, but I really want it reinforced because of constant slamming. 

Drunk me goes to let the dog out and slams things
I think the cali patch bullshit is the thing where they keep some backing paper and install Sheetrock backwards.

Absolutely not, that is insanity. Just follow what I said and everyone around will think you are a contractor
Yea, I’m not putting up new walls, just fixing 1-2 inch holes, well and one big hole.
Yeah just float lightly and sand

Is there anything that isn't priced in? "It's priced in" is like the "No u" of comebacks. You can't win an argument after that.
People saying "no u" is also priced in

So just look at allllll the leisure stocks from 3 months ago

Any hotel or travel stock. 

The first mention that the US might Ease Travel Restrictions was 2 months ago

Since then the entire travel, gig, and restaurants sectors are up 15-30%

You have to hear info and plan for it accordingly
Things are not always priced in. But old news almost always is. 

Apple in court with Epic? Priced in. 

Remember big boi traders have Bloomberg terminals. They have like 10x the data we have. There’s a reason investors pay $2000 a month for this software. 

These things are not priced in literally, however. They are psychologically. It’s a mind game.
Hehe my university pays for terminal and nobody else uses it. Suck it yahoo nerdz.
What university?

I could enroll for almost nothing and gain access to a 20k a year terminal. Not a bad investment lol
Rotman commerce at u of t. Tuition is $17,800 cad. So much less than terminal but not cheap. You didn’t think that Econ or silly linguistics students got a terminal subscription did you? Also for international students it’s like $75,000 cad.
That data is just that

Data

It’s just reactionary, you have to be proactive so you become the Data they sling

Imagine if Homer Simpson had taken Compu-Global-Hyper-Mega-Net public with an IPO. 

The front page of CNBC would read "Compu-Global-Hyper-Mega-Net founder Homer Simpson is worth $2.2 billion after his company's two-day IPO pop"
This gives me an idea.

Open app. See red. Why did I buy mindmed at $4. Close app.
Did any of you here make millions out of rivian?
ur mom did
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Lmao it's not even a double up
Media says so![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Probably not, they’d have to have invested millions at IPO to make millions.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Investors who got in pre-IPO did, for sure. People who preordered trucks also had the ability to buy shares at $13, and at $78 I think, but the volume was super limited. Those people made bank, but not millions.
I have about $27k of collateral for about $5.2k premium in TSLA. c'mon stay above $1100. Daddy Musk make it happen!!!

I just remembered Cramer said when oil goes down MRNA goes up but of course thats wrong so my FDs are damn near useless.
Is TLRY up AH for a reason?
Probably because Sundial absolutely smashed earnings. Weed season has started again.

And actually...with covid being not good for clubs and alcohol, weed is the lovely alternative for people staying at home.
That’s fair. Thanks! Thought I missed some TLRY news
I bidded it up to make my losses look temporarily better, while lowering my cost average.

Win-win situation.
buying unprofitable growth stocks is deep value investing. you have growth stocks where you bet that the profitability and growth will last longer than whats priced in. You have value stocks where you bet that the profitability can improve. And you have deep value where you expect they can stop losing money.
PUTS ON OTLY? Am I the only one who thinks they go down the drain again?

Doesn’t matter. I guarantee we drop back down to $464 by noon tomorrow
Tlry going to moon tomorrow. Chart looks great.
it might go up but to predict a next day movement based on a chart is a fool's errand
I’ve been saying that since 33$ a share
Protip: dont chase high strikes, find good stocks and buy calls at the money, 1-2 months out. 

Like today for instance someone was saying how they need amd to get to 170... Its cringey as fuck to read that and reminds me of where i was a year ago with all these $300 options that werent gonna do shit. 

TLDR save your moneys and purchase the pricier options, its worth it
Plus, if you go itm it take away extrinsic value and keeps the thetagang fuckers off your tendies.
Solid advice…I think
Sorta but at the same time it's devaluing especially if it's not hitting target price

In all seriousness the economy and market make no fucking sense anymore it’s the wild west. we just openly watched guys tax loss harvest millions on jpegs while a realtor group sold homes at a loss with record low rates hitting every day then we added 300 billion to a car company that makes up <1% of global sales. Not to mention this all happened in a fucking week and nobody questioned any of it. 

SPY 500 eoy
Just enjoy the ride
Until the drugs run out, keep the party going.
This!
In order to make sense you need to stop making sense
I remember watching something in my business ethics class about how there are firms out there that use fucking ultra fast gigabrain supercomputers to trade based on extremely short term formulas that predict insanely tiny fluctuations in stock price like we’re talking seconds here. Just dumping millions in and then .239 seconds later selling for profit and just doing this non stop all day. I can’t help but think how many of those have been geared towards meme Stonks and tickers mentioned here to inverse us and make millions.
Go read Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, discusses this in depth
That's the name of the game baby. We are just riding the algorithmic trading of large institutions. 

Let me stress this.. RETAIL DOES NOT, I REPEAT, RETAIL DOES NOT HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH MONEY TO EFFECT PRICE ACTION AT ALL. NEVER EVER EVER TOO INFINITY AND BEYOND.

You move with the market and ride the waves of institutional investing. That's all you can do.
isn't this just called "high frequency trading"?
Yeah I think that’s what it’s called

Bot replies
Water is actually not wet; It makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the state of a non-liquid when a liquid adheres to, and/or permeates its substance while maintaining chemically distinct structures. So if we say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the object.

People that said tesla is overvalued will be fuming because rivian is at least x2 more overvalued compared to tesla fundamentally
Rivian is now the second biggest US car maker by market cap. The top is in.
rivian will go down inevitably
Intel was so overvalued before 2001 crash it still hasn't recovered after 20 years.
Intel finally building factories again so this will change in a few years
I'm bullish on Intel  and have been BTFD  but the previous poster is right.  Intel is still below 2001 prices...20 years later.  Cautionary tale.

Big 5 sporting good doing great.  Gonna watch that tomorrow
I’ve been in for a couple weeks. Every dip is bought and when the market tanked earlier this week, it held up really well. It’s legit.
Bond market was closed today, which means institutional levels of volume was not going to happen. This is why trading was ass, choppy and flat today. 

If you didn't know that going into today, you most likely lost money.
Jokes on you. I would have lost money anyway
Ha! This was genuinely funny!
Thanks to all the bears and bulls for the put premium 🤡

“Sweetgreen is an American fast casual restaurant chain that serves salads.”

Good luck with that.
I saw it. But I’m not totally convinced that I want to dive into the restaurant business with winter approaching.
Hrmm.  Is there data on Uber Eats usage during winter months?
My fear, and I hope I’m wrong, is another spike in covid and more restrictions.
Soy boy convention center. WEN to the moon.
I mean I put everything into 3 DAY ATM calls on SPY.  We shall see.  I do enjoy a good all in.

Lol do you play AAPL shares or something
About 15% of my portfolio is in FDs 20% in leaps. Rest are shares. About 4% in appl shares. My FDs are NVDA and QCOM calls. QQQ and SPY leaps. Not very degenerate but it’s plenty for me
There’s a trend buying $PLTR and setting limit sell at $30+ 😅 RIGHT AFTER I BUY PUTS!

I almost bought at 98. Kinda wish I did. But also don’t see the highs lasting

TBH surprised RIVN is holding it’s support, scooped up a couple dozen shares. Weirdly it semi-inverses TSLA chart.
Never really seriously considered puts until Rivian. When are options out?
Who the fuck is an investor in NKLA? I know that we are in a major EV bubble, but at least with companies like Rivian you have a very, very small chance that after 30/40 years they will be able justify their current market cap. NKLA is just a fraud. You have millions of companies to choose from and you just decide to put money in NKLA. How anyone comes to this conclusion is beyond me.
They have good hydrogen tech

Bought $6.5p 11/12, breakeven $6.12

I also just drank my beard with a solo cup of tequila because I bet that INMD would go from $87.5 to $100 in a month and it only hit $99.27

Bruh!!! Fuckin TWINZIES!
Yooooooo nice!! I'm ready for open. It just needs to stay down until then lmao
Lol the question isn't will it stay down but how much lower will it go before we cash out?
> I think it will go down to $10k.
Like.... Market cap? Tomorrow before close? I'm holding you to it
Tbh even though it's still a few cents above $6.12, the jump at open around this level would make me a very happy boy
bought the same; RIDE 6.5p 11/12 for 0.38. Hope RIDE tanks under 6 at open

I know but they guy is paralyzed that would just make me a piece of shit
Move in below her. Problem solved.

/u/zeebee098 (0/1) made a bet that BYND would go to 120.0 when it was 107.39 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

I should have never doubted my vibe and bought roblox calls for earnings things would be very difficult for me right now
I swear I’m going to scream if AMZN Pops bigly just to sell off relentlessly all fucking day again 

🤡🤡
Ate it and rolled my 12/17 3600 to 3450c. Cause fuckit.
I dont fucking understand why it’s doing this lately 

Driving me insane. I was up 3k today on my 3600 Nov 19s now I’m down 1,300 🤡🤡
While all the hoopla was about Tesla and the entire market pre inflation numbers was red, amzn quietly hit 3600. It only went down with the tide. It’ll be back once the market calms back down. I just didn’t feel like staring at the big red numbers so I rolled to be safer.
I Really hope it’s not going back to re test 3450 or worse 3311. I really would like a legit assault and close above 3600 tomorrow please 🥰
Nah uh. That would require an amzn specific catalyst and there isn’t any on the horizon. Bezos was selling shares to fund his green charity commitments and yet all you hear is Elon!!!
Catalyst to drop or go above 3600?
To drop that bad. Right now it’s just dropping with the market tide this week.
Looks like I’m going YOLO the fuck out of BBBY.

I believe in Lisa Su supremacy so more AMD weekly calls. Then rotate back in to the mouse from that bigly sell off.
That one guy earlier inspired me to make a bigmac style pb&j sandwich
Are TTCF puts the play? They rescheduled just like PRPL and that worked well for me.
> I think the market is going to go up soon and we should wait for it.
Bias confirmed, titular jacks in place.
New here and can't reply to yesterday's thread. PTON/BYOND Puts worked well! 

Sold BYND PUTs @ Open for 328%
Sold PTON PUTs for 106%

Next target is Zoom and more Peloton. Hard to find cheap ZM PUTs but the CEO dumping shares before earnings serves as a wind flag to where that stock is heading. 

Also can't overlook market pressure from Microsoft, Amazon and Cisco. 🤷

Anyhow hope this part encourages someone... started w/ $5k, currently @ 27k. 

Trying to moon once before EOY. Wish meh luck boyz!! 🍻
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
This stuff confuses me so much. With only 5k you are willing to only focus on options? Or do you also do stocks?
Yeah, I have a side portfolio of biotech and copper ( hello my copper bulls \o ). I am beginning to like options more and more. The leverage is addictive. When you win.. you win big and vice versa. 

Trying to learn more about strangling stock options to get the best of both worlds. Worth looking into when you feel confident about some DD.
I guess I need to start learning options then lol. Any good resources to start learning?
You think peloton gonna drop even more?
I'll start by stating this is not professional investing advice and I am not a trader by profession. That said...

I think we'll see a pop before another drop. My thesis really revolves around the following:
- High Cash Burn Rate
- EOY Stock Selloff for Tax Losses ( A ton of bag holders )
- Peloton Guide Being Released 2022 ( Missed Christmas Opp )
- Hiring Freeze
- Growing competition
- Return to normal conditions ( Gym Access / Social Life / etc.. )
- Management looking to be profitable by the end of 2022 ( Highly doubt they'll make it. )

I think these factors will lead to them potentially earning less than anticipated and us seeing an offering sooner than later. 

Anyhow, that's my speculative hunch. I should probably just be buying 2023 Leap Calls because my big bets always get cracked. 🙃

It's a shot in the dark I'm willing to take though. Cheers 🍻
Dear gawd where is the support for markup??

isnt the saying "not financial advice" so ubiquitous with people giving financial advice on the internet that saying "not financial advice" becomes as effective or based in reality as saying "i have an invisible shield" in a game of tag? isn't it even more incriminating at this point?

i dont have a lot of trust in the justice system but im pretty sure 99% of people whose cases can be boiled down to "i'm a retard and i listened to this guy on the internet and now im a broke retard"  are going to be thrown out of court.

^(edit: this post was brought to you by: "amc 100k guaranteed not financial advise.")
Options on the WSB front page, finally.
like the good old days, when people actually posted positions
So.  I posted last week about picking a lic plate that you saw in traffic that especially grabbed your attention and YOLO the ticker that you see on it.  Welp, on the way home from the ole wage-slavery yesterday I saw mine.  TEA-73C.  Got home , looked it up and there is no TEA, well there is but it comes up as N/A.  Closest one I could find with options is TEAM.  Looked at the chart, and what a beaut.  It was at $433 on the day down from $483.  What about 73C though?  Well, the way I figure it, TEAM has four letters so how about 473.  Looked at the chain, 19 Nov 21 470C is looking nice.  I'm all in.
If true you get retard applause.
Can you believe that in July, I forgot to close 10 SOFI $17.5 short puts, and was assigned 1000 shares at 17.5 after market closed? Luckily I held on to it, lol

Sometimes being retarded pays off.
> I'm sorry, what?
**SOMETIMES BEING RETARDED PAYS OFF.**
It’s better to be lucky than shart
Lucky, as in buying TSLA and GME.
i can believe that, but ill believe pretty much anything i read on the internet.

Hell no, just like I haven't sold TSLA stocks I bought presplit.

Looking at Rivian sitting over 100 why is lucid so under valued compared to the other ev companies 🧐
They will both double in 12 months in my opinion
My covered calls are in danger
Just YOLO'd my life savings into FB $350 12/10 calls. Am I smart or retarded?
Super smaht.
Lol I have same strike but Jan and March 2023 leaps and even then I'm unsure when it'll do well so...

Hopefully you print asap.
I hope it prints…
Could be good or bad
Smart
Buying EVGO and CHPT calls for next week. Maybe VLTA and BLNK too.
The money printing is not transitory
It almost seems like money printing and inflation are somewhat vaguely correlated or something
You know I think you might be onto something
Please tell me what Rivian has that Ford or VW do not have? I do not mean that rhetorically or as an insult.
Nothing. They don’t have the manufacturing experience. That’s where it’s at.
I remember all the news about the problems Tesla and Elon had with getting their factories online and the struggle to meet numbers. That’s what all these new ev players have to face. Until that first car rolls off the line, it’s all just promises. 

Like, when’s nikola rolling that first truck out? Oh wait, they’re still glamming out their factory design on the computer.
I agree 100%. 

Tesla was founded in 2003. It’s treated like some startup. They were using AI (digital twin, generative engineering, etc) since day 1. 

They’ve been collecting tons and data and feeding it to the design and manufacturing process. 

It’s hard to catch up with company moving forward like this. VW knows all about this with mission T, etc. 

It’s coming down to what tech are you using to manufacture not how cool is your prototype…to your point.
Hype guy

That’s all
Amazon will probably make them their sole fleet provider eventually
So, 100,000 trucks over 10 years. With 10,000 trucks a year with $10,000 profit (which is generous). Do the math and see how that lines up with valuation.
Shit I 100% agree with you, but it's the perception right?
Well of course. There’s nothing wrong with cashing in this stock. If there’s a play, it’d be silly to miss it. There’s always long term and short term.
> Automakers are in a tough spot. They can't really compete with Tesla on electric vehicles because they don't have the money to invest in them, and Honda is already doing well with hybrids.
Uh what? 

They are all heavily investing in them. The automakers are in a tough spot they created and allowed to exist. Ford is pouring almost everything into EV. GM is to an extent. VW big time. Toyota last time I checked was still stuck on hydrogen (why I don't know.) And Honda, will be in the EV game. They are pretty quiet about their overall moves but don't be shocked if all Honda vehicles are electric before any of the US automakers go full electric. 

The issue is, Tesla is lightyears ahead in tech, knowledge, and infrastructure. Pretty much no one can catch up to them except.... Ford, Rivian, maybe VW. 

Ford has the weight and knowledge of the auto world. They can move mountains better than all of them. If they wanted to make all their vehicles EV by 2022 and have charging stations at all their independent dealerships, they could do it. Ford is invested into Rivian because they are smart. They know a startup has less corporate BS and can innovate faster than they can. They are using Rivian as an RD partner.  Don't be shocked if Ford buys out Rivian in the future. Or merges. 

Rivian has some the best in the auto industry working with or for them. They have backing from Ford, Cox automotive (not a fan but seems like others think highly of them), Amazon and other big players. Plus Amazon contract to deliver 100,000 Amazon delivery vehicles. There is a reason these players are all involved in Rivian.

VW the PR disaster from the dieselgate made VW try to pick up the pieces try to make their vehicles look clean from a marketing stand point. When EU emission standards got more intense the only answer was to focus on EVs. VW is logical in that, they knew that the US would eventually force automakers to produce only EVs and that gas engines were coming to an end. Plus side, they can sell themselves as a clean energy vehicle company and forget about that dieselgate. VW is deep in it. They will be a big player in the EV world long term. They cannot compete with Tesla, on almost every level. But they will offer a nice, well priced, reliable vehicle, I have no doubt. 

As for other automakers. Good luck, I think many of them have no idea what is coming at them. Tesla gets it. Ford does. VW kinda does. Rivian does. 

As for the startups Canoo, Lucid, Lordtown, may as well put a fork in them now. Lucid... ugh, maybe they can figure things out but they need at least 4 years to catch up to the above players and I just don't see them doing it. Any other EV company will go belly up or get bought up in the next few years. 

Auto industry is about to look a lot different in the next 10 years.
Ford has $200B in debt that will always continue growing

Researching Globalstar(GSAT) at 1.63 per share I would say it would be a low risk/no risk investment to buy some, not a lot, some.  I'll be looking up to see what other services they offer, if they have many job openings, and any mention of them in the news.
It's like lottery tickets really.

The way to play PLTR is to buy shares or LEAPS. If we're going to have some sort of correction, it might go lower than 22. If not, then 22 might be the bottom. It will rise to 26 again but it will probably take at least 2 months. A 4 dollar gain.

So....with the way the markets have been, should we just go all in RIVN because since TSLA is over 1 trillion RIVN should be too! While we are at it F is so undervalued we should just buy the ENTIRE call option chain, lmao.
Alright SPY please pump to 467 tomorrow 🙏🏼
It’s gonna dump

Calls on Pete Davidson

Puts on Kim K
Anyone who talks shit on Pete Davidson is an absolute bitch, man had Ariana grande dedicate an entire section in a music video to his fucking dick absolute fucking legend that man is
I don't think I've ever watched one of her videos. Which song is that?
No idea, it came out when I was in college and would get thrown on
Pete Davidson getting mad overhyped for pulling a 41 year old ex porn star with 4 kids.
She could never make it in porn. I saw her tape with Ray J
She just kinda laid their.  Like a fish or a hobbit.
> I'm not sure if this is a troll or what
OH HOW THE TURN TABLES VISUALMOD
kanye gonna tag in like ima let you finish in a minute but over there in the corner by yourself
That whole family is fukked! She’s one used up bitch, that Kim K….
His penis has to be huge that’s a big gap to fill
Is it too much to ask for a +2% day for SPY tomorrow?
> It is too much to ask for a +2% day for SPY tomorrow.
Havent been green all week, why shouldnt tomorrow wipe me out completely.
I'm right there with you, it's been a tough month for me
Loading up on NVDA before earnings
Are you gonna hold through earnings or bail?
See what I do first and then do the opposite. I bought PayPal calls, I bought coin calls, I sold my SOFI calls and shares, and sold my Disney puts.
I like both those plays though. PayPal is free money right now, and COIN could be going back to $370
Had I waited till after earnings sure. But I did all of that pre earnings when the pump was on high. The coin option sale was really dumb, I’ll get back into one of those on the chain probably. The analyst ratings not dropping was nice.
Damn, yeah that’s rough
Might sell in pre earnings run up. Got burned too many times post earnings on AAPL. Gives me PTSD
hm…. I may hop on that. Need to check the chart but I’m thinking it might run up more before earnings
PayPal calls, Wish shares and SPY calls. Rate my asshole @open
depends on expiry you'll be alright
0 dte on the spy. 7 dte on the PayPal and $5 avg on the wish shares
damn man ..... you might be okay with spy.. not sure about PayPal its beep red for like 40 days straight for no reason... wish is a meme stock and its a shit company  . might moon at some point cuz of the apes but eventually I expect it will come down crashing unless they fix it
I don't get the PayPal dip honestly
they have lower projections for the coming years.. I think long term it will recover tho
I mean 25% drop is a bit much. I'm long on baba tho so fuck if I know anything
yeah its forsure oversold But I don't think it will recover by next week unless something crazy happens
I agree. I've got 207c so I'm not asking a whole lot
Puckered
Bond markets are tame as fuck. If this persists through open and the day we are going to rally fucking hard, and squish bears who are forced to cover. BUY THE SEMIS! AMD!
You do realize the bond market was closed yes?
Doesn’t matter. Bears still fucked
you do realize the dollar fucking mooned today yes?
And for your next trick, you’ll tell me about the 10y, or whatever else it is that has you convinced the market is going down. Yawn.
You do realize you are a fucking nerd yes?
> Yes.
You do realize you will be insolvent by 22’ yes?
10 year yield futures opened at 8pm go on CNBC and you can get a quote
Touch the chart… tell me what date you see….
Time is moving and so are the times
Fuck me. I'm sick of seeing "forced to cover!""short queeze!!!"
SPY 500c 12/31 lookin kinda tasty at .25 a contract
Loaded up today S P Y 500 E O Y
Either 500 or 430 EOY so why not.
https://ibb.co/cX6T6fH

Yeah u go balls deep?
Not yet. Looking at some plays for tomorrow. Thinking about throwing 10k at it. Should get me like 350-375 contracts including commission and fees
https://ibb.co/dBqtBwt

Yeah it will print
K bet I’m in at open tomorrow
$485 calls are looking dicey, other calls will be nice
Yeah worst case I sell the 485C at 500% ROI & roll them over tomorrow
If we get some Green Day’s tomorrow and next week they will be good. Then put those into the $500 and $530 calls and wait for nice profit
Might buy 30-40 contracts and let it ride
They were considerably less tasty last week at $0.52 when I went balls deep 🤡
Some of you thinks joe rogan is still alive and it shows

I am very excited about tomorrow’s flash crash

What’s up with weight loss surgery? Seems risky. Why not just eat at a slight caloric deficit over time?
That’s like telling someone on this sub to not try and get rich quick with speculative options and just stick your money into vanguard fund for 30 years
Bro, this sub is totally different
People want the easy way in every facet of life. Nobody wanna cut back calories bro lol I’m doing it right now and it’s not fun at all.
What are your kcals per day?
1,700 - 1,900
Damn that’s low.
It’s hell

Everyone wants a quick fix. Just like everyone wants to get rich quick
American dream lol
Just get Adderall
Or smoke crack
Shit is like a panacea
It really is though. So many people are on it.
those are like the people who play 0dte to get rich quick instead of a long term investments... people are lazy. also pretty sure like 90% put the weight right back on after as well, just like ill probably lose 90% on my 0dte amzn put tomorrow
Fuck long term investing…FDs all the way.

Welcome to the 21st century
Uh guys is buying a 4 bedroom house in the middle of nowhere (New Brunswick) with an 85k population for only $150k and only having to pay like $2000 yearly property tax worth it?
Sure. Invite us over for a party
Depends on your income
That’s a larger population than where I live and I still have fun
If it’s near Rutgers and you’re renting it out to students yeah otherwise why the fuck would you buy a house in New Brunswick
If it makes you happy why not
no problem just hold it for 1000 years and it’ll be worthless
Lmfao how the fk would we know do you want to live there?
he's doin the elon thing
depends on your medical, social and child education needs.
My issue would be the low pricing of the house. If I were you, I'd go higher in the housing price esp if you have the income to cover it. A city with 85k population is a decent population.
Could you get a house in Old Brunswick instead?  Or better yet, Old Dipswick?
2k a year in taxes… 

That’s so poor.

I pay 45k in property tax yearly

I can’t share my specific move due to cap size but I will share the play in general if anyone is interested. It will be effective across most stocks in the sector. 

Social media gaming. These online games are not just games anymore they are going to become the next generations social media giants and overtake FB and Twitter in ad revenue soon. 

The market got this wrong and got caught with their pants down with RBLX but that’s not the only play. A bunch of them just had 20%-40% gains today and I think it’s just the beginning. 

My DM’s are open for anyone interested.
Why can’t you just list them? You can avoid the market cap thing by just typing the full company name. I give you permission. Lol.

NVDA is gonna open at $320 again tomorrow and this time pump into the $330s
YES IT IS
Yep
Is Evergrande gonna fuck us up again tomorrow?
Got a comment autoremoved from r/stocks because it used WSB language and apparently they are above this place lol, fucking snowflakes can’t handle the word FD?  The place seems like a therapy group for anyone who fucked up with options and needs a hug and reminder that only ITM MSFT leaps should ever be considered.
Looking at my current portfolio and my current returns for the year, I do wish I had only ITM MSFT leaps tbh.

&#x200B;

Unless you can give me a hug? A WSB hug is always better than a hug from r/stocks
I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with investing that way, but don’t be a condescending prick to anyone that dabbles in options.  I think the majority of people here have like 90-95% of their money in “safe” ETFs and blue chips.  Nothing wrong with aggressive investing some of your money.
Nobody told me that. I assumed we are all in growth stocks and FDs.

Understand your point, but I just want a WSB hug please. Down 10+k in a day after ER sucks
I’d hug you but don’t want your ER vibes on me.
TSLA red. What a wonderful day 🥰
From like 3% up at open too. Idk if you believe in stock horoscope but some might call that buyer exhaustion, bearish.

It'd probably a bad sign that I'm up 600% over  the last 18 months and haven't done any DD or looked at technical analysis at all over that time.

Oh well, full steam ahead.
Just went to the store to buy cucumbers and asparagus to eat in between meals. I’m starving bruh.
Those are some oddly phallic choices for food there tren, they didn’t give you the wrong kind of juice this time did they ;p

you ever try pickles?
I just found out pickles are cucumbers like 3 weeks ago
wait what?
It’s the same fruit
but they taste so different
I’ve never had pickles then lol
Those won't do the trick. You need protein. Try a protein bar or nuts or something with chickpeas or beans.
I can’t eat stuff with calories in between meals.
Hes been trying nuts all day behind Wendy's but it hasn't been doing the trick.
You're eating cuck cum out of a ber sperg's ass?
Asparagus is crazy expensive, green beans and carrots are a way better value.
First of all fuck you for suggesting green beans and second of all carrots are okay but grilled asparagus is just so good with only 3 calories per stick.
I like women ok stop saying I’m gray
Bro, I thought you and my mouth had something special
Oh yeah we did oh man your mouth is incredible
Calls on this guy’s mouth, ticker ORAL
Yeah heh wooo that mouth
The one sucking is gray
That’s the truth
Whatever you say fomo
PDT is meant to keep the poors poor. Change my mind.
I mean if you’re trading options on a non cash sub 25k account anyways the chances of a good ol poverty mollywhop seem inevitable
It’s true honestly there’s no real rational reason not to let people with 100 bucks day trade to practice. The guise the government uses saying they are “protecting the little guys” is BS they are protecting the rich. Cuz that’s why cigarettes and alcohol are legal right? To protect us
Most people with less  than 25k would lose it before they even knew how to read the basics of a stock
Doesn't even matter. You know the risks. Again it's no different than ANYTHING else.
They say it's for their protection, yet poor's are allowed to go bankrupt selling naked calls just fine
It only applies to margin

The Fed also said everything is fine in 2007 I believe.
Fed has said everything is fine until shit is exploding all around them for every crisis since 1980
Like half they shit just empty. Construction out there completely bunk. Look up chinese ghost towns. They just build towns to build towns.

Rivian production doubled in 2 weeks. At that pace they'll make enough trucks for the entire galaxy by mid next year.

My hopium is telling me that corn will rip to $70,000 near open tomorrow and that RIOT then opens around $41 and goes on a tear to $47 before noon.  $50 by 1pm ET and $55 at EOD.

&#x200B;

$80s next week after corn hits $80k over the weekend and RIOT's ER produces the cheat code to corn: positive earnings, cash flow positive operations due to their 200MW of institutional leasing and a closed shelf offering.
That is some goddamn great copium
Thought so too!

&#x200B;

The price movement on RIOT might be a stretch but I don't believe this consolidation in corn lasts long at all.  Leveraged longs got liquidated on Wednesday's afternoon sell.  I'm betting it's ripping back to ATHs as soon as tonight.
Take my energy, I'm betting on the same thing, if it happens I will be up 100k+

So my 12/3 AMD $150c are gonna be ITM at open huh. 

That's cool 🥲
any specific news as to why SPY is rocketing AH? or is it the classic 'no news is good news' situation

![img](emote|t5_2th52|5958)
Plus it’s getting added to the S&P 500 index!
IDK but it seems to run AH quite a bit.
Due for a green day if nothing else. But this is the same AH treatment they've given SPY every day during this dip. Won't be surprised if it opens at 468 and won't be surprised if we open at 463

A lone trader was buying MILLIONS worth of Puts when TSLA was well above 1200 🧸

i have no brainer
Shit yesterday around 1pm another 13 million dollar TSLA Put order was put in Nov 19 1100 strike when it was 1050ish.

Ridiculously hard to find Uber past 11pm at ATL Airport. 

Puts on Atlanta
Lyft man. You can always get a Lyft
Yeah, I found Lyft. Surge pricing though. $180 ride for what usually costs $70

Guess Lyft Bullish?
Geeeesh that’s pretty bad
I’ve never used an Uber or Lyft. Heard of it
There was this woman at the airport who was also waiting for Uber but I don’t think she has ever used it. She kept talking to the driver without entering the car for about 5-8 minutes showing her phone, trying to make sure that the car is the car shown on her phone.
Was assigned a partner for a group project. Her family name looked familiar, so I googled her and turns out her family is worth 7 Billion… what’s the play?
Tell her about your crippling gambling addiction
Take her to Wendy’s
Figure out the fetish. Be the fetish….
gonna wait for TSLA to go to $900 then buy the dip
>Idk man I’m starting to think that’s not going to happen it held pretty flat today after initial drop.

I believe Elon already sold what he is going to sell for now. So I think if it was going to drop it would have happened this week. He sold about 5% so far. But the volume on buying back in must be huge from those 6.25$ options he has. What a fucking champ. Going to dump like 28B in stock pay about that in taxes and end up with way more stocks than when he started.
Idk man I’m starting to think that’s not going to happen it held pretty flat today after initial drop.

Wish I had bought more XPEV and LI shares in May.

Doubtful. I can only afford to invest a hundred or so at a time. 

But the gains would have been even better than they already are.

Has anyone been to a Best Buy lately? What a poorly lit dirty store. They look like they are long on PLTR

3. The market is irrational and will stay irrational until morale improves.

Calls on spy call IV spike tomorrow. Tried telling this sub to cop when IV was low but no one listened to me
So calls on the open? Or too late bc I didn’t buy calls at the close?

I got busy at 3:30 and barely I’m missed it
> I would say it’s too late, but if you really want to try, I suggest buying calls at the open tomorrow.
It’s gonna keep running, 9:30 or 9:40 depending on pre market
It'll get to 12 before it spikes.  

Mark it.
That’s because SPY is weeks away from any significant movement
Not according to the RSI
could go either way but RSI isn’t really a good measure for SPY right now. 

We’ll see. By end of next week we’ll probably be around $470-472 range.

Sold all my AMD and bought XLNX fuck it cocks out
Why? They should be heading the same direction
> No. They are not the same thing
They will be soon
Buying XLNX gives you about a 20% discount on AMD shares at current prices.
Oh are you talking sh*res here? Or does this apply to my degenerate weeklies?
U dumb ass 😒
Y?🥺
AMD will be 200 by end of year 500 by 2022 and 700 by 2023
You do know that AMD is acquiring XLNX and that 1 share of XLNX will be equal to 1.7 shares of AMD right? 

Looking at current prices: 

1 share of AMD = $145

1 share of XLNX = $205 

$145 x 1.7= $246.50. 

Which means there’s a 20% discrepancy between AMD and XLNX. You’re essentially buying AMD at a steep discount.
> You are a fucking idiot.

There are many indian foods that doesnt use red chili powder like that, but restaurants makes those 3 or 4 dishes which appeal to masses
Exactly, but most over use spices which really point to an inexperienced chef. The best ones are those that take advantage of the wealth of spices to elevate their food

‘ It’s doomed ‘ Spy CEO
How can you be the ceo when I coulda sworn I was
Joint statement- didn’t you read the memo ?
“CEO”, you must be new here.
What you mean ? I heard VIX are launching a new product line in collaboration with 🍏 too
> You're fucking kidding me.
I am
Oh lord glad I went all in on calls, after hours looking lovely
Ok tsla just do that thing where you open up bigly and I can exit my spread with a very small profit, then do whatever you want.
Yo, retards wtf happened to BB?  
Any reason it shit the bed today, or just a typical day for BB bagholders?
BB just overall sucks to trade. The CEO isn't a particularly strong leader and any potential good news is drowned out by their utter lack of marketing and wishy washy investor relations. They're a boomer company without boomer investors.
Sweet. As long as no bad news, I'll keep buying at 10.50 and selling at 11.50.
$BB is the infinite money glitch imo
Government should increase spending

Kind of want a martini but I have no lemon or olives

Does a pear slice garnish sound any good? Or too juicy
You wanna have a fruit salad,  or a drink?
I had cherries so I settled on a manhattan instead of a martini
Cheers. Just had a sip of nice 10yr van winkle. Wouldn't dare to mix it
I had pappy one time I personally think it's kind of overhyped I prefer Weller which is slightly easier to acquire but lately I've been enjoying this local Atlanta micro batch bourbon my brother got me

Also I don't think a nice manhattan really masks a nice bourbon I think it can open it up

>Amplifying a bubble doesn’t somehow avoid its consequences – it makes those consequences worse. Amplifying a bubble doesn’t even create “wealth” for the economy as a whole, only temporary opportunities for wealth transfer between individuals. That’s because the wealth isn’t in the price – it’s in the future stream of cash flows. If one holder sells, the next buyer has to hold the bag, and ultimately it’s the cash flows that matter. The only thing progressively higher valuations do is to progressively lower the long-term returns that investors will subsequently enjoy if they buy (or hold) at those valuations.
Plan is to watch spy and qqq rebound super hard since I sold my calls at a severe loss.  Granted I moved money into RIOT and made back what I lost, but a severe spy pump would have been nice for the 50 11/19 480 calls I sold.
To QE infinity and beyond!

Zillow’s ibuying program failed because they actually don’t have much proprietary data — most of their site is public data and MLS

The platform with the most proprietary data around property trends is Airbnb.  This company is gonna eat more of the real estate market than most people realize
They failed because they offered a price based on the average home in the area. Everyone with below average homes with underlying problems sold to them for the average price, and everyone with above average homes with no problems sold to other humans for higher prices.
This \^
ZG🚀
No lol

It was the processing fees for home purchases

They never figured on the sheer VOLUME of houses “traded” as Real Estate Gamblers used their platform to make thousands of transactions.

That’s why
It that were true they wouldn’t be dumping all their holdings below purchase price.
DIS has more room to drop it had record revenues & earnings in 2019 and 2018. It can never hope to match those numbers yet it is trading at 10% above its 2019 highs.
i hope it does. I was thissss close to going all in jan calls today, but held my ground.
As perma bull as I am on the Mouse, it does feel like a house of cards tbh. Especially since any slightly bad outlook for Plus (really the only thing it's got going for it atm) kneecaps the mouse hard
They are losing cable sub in Espn and simply cannot make it back via streaming (cable gives 5$ per sub + ad revenue where as Espn plus doesn’t get even half that). Not to mention they have shit ton of money for sports deals.
That was then and this now, next drop if any and I’ll call.
DIS to create metaverse on RLBX.

I think bounce. But there is a good comment somewhere saying it might only be worth $4-5 because of the digital wallet sales being worthless and that was half the business model. IDK for sure, but I expect a bounce to at least $6 short term

I wonder if that's true for the 70k new merchants they got this quarter. If there's a conservative lag in guidance, they could become profitable next year and beat the crap out of revenue estimates.
Afrm will follow the steps of upst and will hit 300-400 in a year

BiG Fucking Value.  All day every day
still holding up AH
I’m so fired up.  If it gets over $60, it all over.  Haven’t had this feeling since January.
Haha, bro, what if as a prank we bought TSLA calls and pulled each other off, but just as like a joke, you know?
I’ve already done one of those things, and sure I can buy TSLA calls tomorrow too 😌

It’s not going to go below $200.  They tried it every day this week and failed every single time.  Enjoy missing out on a 50% gain because you wanted it a mere 5% cheaper.
You know, you're right.  I wish you much luck.
Yeah big time. I had them for the week dumped them today. I think they can be had around 182. Waiting til then or for a clear buy signal

I was going to do 466
Why did my SPY 470 call shit the bed today?  I bought it yesterday and market was up today.  I never make money on SPY
spy so rigged bro of all the ways i lose money playing that casino is always the quickest way
It was up 3% at open then fell all day to close at -20%.  But SPY is higher than when I purchased the call
Same. Theta is a bitch.
Are you being serious or are you just fucking with us?
Sorry.  I usually buy way OTM stuff so theta destroys it.  I thought theta would be kinder to stuff close to ITM but I guess not
Theta. 
The gains have to outpace your losses to time decay.
Value went down because it’s less likely to increase the closer it gets to expiring
We have a whole 7 days! 😂 it only needs to go up 1.5% to be ITM
I have no clue then. I bought calls at the same strike last week expiring tomorrow for around 3.5 cents it’s now worth 0.07 cents 🤡 so don’t listen to me. I’m clearly smooth brained as fuck
I mean, really this is just gambling against people who already know what hand is going to be played. 

The reason $500 12/1 SPY calls are $.04 is because the street knows there’s no fucking chance SPY runs that much in the next few weeks.

I am going to liquidate everything I can and buy shares of $PSFE. Even if they discovered that the entire executive board of Paysafe perpetrated 9/11, this stock would be worth $9, not $4. Blackrock increased their shares by 43000% days ago. This is either when you buy the fear and go all in, or admit you are a retard who has no idea what anything is worth anymore.
As a psfe bag holder, i can confidently tell you that blackrock increasing their position in any stock isnt always a good thing.

Its in their 13f, nobody reported on it so can’t find an easy link :/. Looks like Goldman Sachs bought calls and shares today as well.

It just doesn't feel right to see bowl of Pho going up 20 to 40% in prices man

This is really bad. I mean we have money to invest, gamble, and speculate with but there are lots of people without any saving.

Don't even get me started on rent and housing...
Not enough news about the price of pho being too damn high
Pho real, yo.
It just doesn't feel right  
Dont even get me started on climate disaster...
Still trying to decided if I'm going to keep my spy  December calls . I'm down 50%😂😭
market correction has already passed. Its gonna be all green the rest of the year. Daddy Powell going to take care of us
I really hope so, I went all in with 60% of my portfolio.....
oh shit lol...
Yep, lol
I'm probably going all spy 11/25 calls tomorrow. the infamous turkey day rally is upon us...
It's only a loss if you sell
I’m gonna sell all my shares of nvidia and start a wheel on Ford
DO IT
DONT DO IT
DO IT
Imagine not buying RIVN because its overpriced. Easy 20% gain from yesterday’s bottom
Always go full retard
AMD 147C 12/3 will they fly?
people really don’t understand how important futures are
is that because they arent important at all?

Paysafe at $4 wtf 😳
Holy fuck, rip to any PSFE bulls out there. That’s gotta sting.
*whatsup toilet cloggers*
Told you guys everything rally tomorrow 🚀
based on what? We’re moving sideways. Down a few dollars one day up a few dollars the next isn’t exactly a rally
SPY is at the same level it was most of the day?
> SPY is at the same level it was most of the day.
Spy about to break high of day . $466 open for sure
Hoping for a run now
Can’t wait to wake up to the daily tomorrow and the first comment I see is the guy who feels weird around men that dude really starts my day off right. It’s a ritual now seeing his comments first thing
**Supply chain issues:** Ain’t even my final form brah
Wow NVDA
DIS open $170 tomorrow.
on what news? that stock is gonna end the year at $166
I'd jizz
All the gains to be made in DIS happened last Nov-Dec when vaccines were announced.

Here’s every earnings report for the next year:

Parks doing well? Meh

Movies doing well? Meh

Cruises sailing? Meh

Disney+ still eating shit compared to Netflix? -5-10%
My $170 calls are crying for the past two days -90%
Imagine crying about inflation when we all been in here printing money from options/investing/real estate for past 2 years 😂😂😂
That's the point.

None of this money is worth anything now.
Yes gasoline is same price it was 10 years ago. This must be WEIMAR REPUBLIC 🤪🤪🤪
Anyone remember the old school x men cartoon, that shit was lit.
Used to watch that at like 6 am before school. Good times.
I loved that shit
It was definitely the good good.
💯
Disney + has it
Wolverine never got his Jean.
The Phoenix saga was the shit.
Sound track rocked
Raise your hand if the mouse fucked you?
I fucked the mouse with all my 165 puts

If the mouse did. It’s a good time to double down
Did that, but too far in red as of now.

Fuck bro post that gain porn
Is that before or after taxes?
Before. I brought some Wendy’s with it no joke
Where did you bring it to?
My mouth
I think we got 1-3 months more of the market going up, I think a few more bad inflation readings and Pow raises rates early
Feb

Edit: not raise rates, but up the taper to $20-25B

I bought AMD $87 calls that expire in June a few months ago and them shits are 3 baggers right now. I still think AMD will be 180 by EOY so I ain’t fucking selling
Just exercise and buy the shares
Wouldn’t make sense to do that now but considering it in June
I have $125 calls for March '22. They're 2 baggers now but I expect 3 baggers EoY.
Can we change that to end of next week….ima need that to work out………
Paysafe is my spirit animal
Your spirit animal got gaped today
Mine is a ssssnek
Pay safe has to be a fucking buy at 4 bucks
It was a definite baghold at least when it slammed down over 30%.

hey guys i came here because i told my friend that i love losing money. he showed me this sub and said that i’d fit right in
What a great friend
AMC CEO Adam Aron dumped $25M worth of shares. Whos buying, apes or institutions? 🦍🪓
Obviously retards.
Doing the same thing we do every day Pinky: Try to short Tesla.
Resolution of the Week: I will not make another trade until u/cashflow_ is unbanned.

Nah, jk. He probably has another user name and still lurking
I just got an all seeing eye award on one of my posts copy pastaing the way he talks lol he’s def lurking
He got banned? Wow.

This is like finding out Hitler died from a history book. Underwhelming.
He lost ban bets
And I found him. You’re done. You’re done. 👮‍♀️🚔.
Just finished 11 hour shift in the restaurant. Made $170 today pretty good. Better than minimum wage. In other news, got declined for an apprenticeship in software that I was hoping for. Great day.
Keep applying dude. You’ll land an apprenticeship
You being sarcastic?
Nice you made 1/50th what I did and I sat here watching lines dance
Seriously? $8500? That would pay off my car and credit card
"Apprenticeship in software" um that sounds like a scam

Just go to a random free to learn code website. Learn.
Then walk up to Microsoft's front door, they'll let you in without a degree.
Yeah for coinbase. It's legitimate.

Been trying my best. Graduated with math degree last year.
I'm not even sure what's that good for? Just self teach. 1 hour a day to build the habit
Are my $464/465/466 Spy calls gonna print tomorrow? Cause I’m feeling used and abused today. The AH gave me a glimmer of hope.
What do you guys think about put leaps on Rivian? It reminds me of NKLA tbh
Not exactly the same
Yeah not exactly but that valuation is fucking high
Just look at Tesla, valuation is way too high but retard strength knows no bounds
This is true. Never bet against a cult following but I don’t  think RIVN established that (yet)
So… high..

https://youtu.be/_BtHxTZrqpk
Rivian actually sells products to customers
Wait til first earnings or something
rivian has a much much higher chance of being bought out by amazon or ford or mcdonalds or whoever the fuck feels like making an electric car in the next 5 years.

What if instead of being born a human you were born a dog or some shit 


Like a suburban living dog just chilling in his comfy dog bed all day getting each meal hand prepped for him and fresh water on deck whenever you want 


Man
I’d love to be reborn a dog, I’d suck my own dick, own a couple humans, free room and board, run around naked fucking other dogs, no foreplay or consent, then have the humans kiss me after I’ve licked my ass, YES.
Unless you’re a dog in the third world
Damn bruh I want to be reborn as a dog in some rich fuck's  mansion
That food tastes like shit man, trust me
One time I was walking on the beach in Florida and there was a French bulldog hanging out on a lounge chair by the pool of one of the mansions I passed. He 100% has a better life than me
Even his health insurance is definitely better than yours.

Lmao you like giving away money huh
Looked like they had a chance when I bought 'em, now they're at 0.015 and ToS won't let me sell at a fractional price and I refuse to give up my 0.005. 

So we rollin' 200 deep
LOLOL feels bad man
Elon and other big Teslaguys keep selling, so not only musk...
They know that the stock is ridiculously overvalued. 

It was $100 when the bull run started in March of 2020 FFS.
In March 2020 maybe...
Of course they do.  It’s due to correct back to 850-900.  From there it either crashes back to fair value (probably around 300-400) or continues up but much more slowly
so puts are the way ?
So not a good time to buy yet?
should I be child-free???
I mean, it's a little harder when they are already 6 and 10 but anything is possible if you believe.

https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/11/theranos-tests-detected-prostate-cancer-marker-in-prostateless-women/
and did those women get prostate cancer? NO!

Theranos may have saved their lives.
> No. Theranos never tested for prostate cancer, and the FDA has no approved tests that use finger prick blood draws to detect any form of cancer or other disease.
Wrong, there's FDA approved finger prick tests for both glucose (diabetes) and INR (blood clotting problems.)
Exactly. These women were probably manly AF. Did anyone ask them if they had hairy chins? Bet.

Clown world through and through 


Play stupid games get smacked. Deal with it
Literally…. Overheard a woman today actually defending the guy, even after realizing he ra&ed a 9 year old
So a question occurs, the “kid” had no way of knowing these things when the shootings occurred, so how can you use them as justification?
Because the shooting was justified anyway, just helps that it made the world a better place
Even if he did know those things, vigil anti killings are still illegal. I find it interesting how people don't understand that the "but he was killing bad guys" argument is actually legally detrimental to the self defense case.
Running away and only shooting when struck or threatened with lethal force is not a vigilante killing...
It’s not vigilante killings when lethal force was used in self defense; the deaths are second effect.

Know one in the trial is using the pedophile status; it’s the media
I hope y'all are in used cars because SHIFT just got juicy as fuk.

\+6000 shares. Shorts about to get crushed on this one with SI +25%. Loading the truck here folks. 

See you on the moon.
GTFO with your look 25% SI bs... that's just a healthy indicator it's a shit stock.
I guess you didn't check their record earnings. It was a blow out.
Good earnings are great, but 25% SI is still a bullshit thing to throw on there like that some how is gonna get you a space suit.  GME had 140% and they still had a hard enough time jacking that shit.
What I'm reading is to go buy puts as soon as this pump is over.
Can I watch?  I’ll be quiet

Who else is shorting the vix
going long here
My brain is telling me to short the highflyers, but The FED will obviously keep it all going, until they can"t.
PSFE weeklies seemed like a no brainer. $3.5 weeklies for .86? You're paying 10 cents for a week's premium and you just had a 40%+ drop. Chances of a 10% rebound from the current price in that time frame is probably really good. Easy chance for a 2x.
Do it!

Lol we actually owe Nancy Pelosi for blocking the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains (i.e. tax all LEAPs, etc.): [https://nypost.com/2021/11/11/pelosi-objected-to-billionaire-tax-in-1-75t-spending-bill/](https://nypost.com/2021/11/11/pelosi-objected-to-billionaire-tax-in-1-75t-spending-bill/)  Actually thanks Nancy for real this time rofl.
Imagine acting like you have enough money where that would even remotely affect you.

You wouldn't be on this sub if that were true.
> A hedge fund manager was arrested for defrauding investors of $4.6 million by pretending to be a billionaire and using his own money to pay off debts incurred in the scam, prosecutors said on Tuesday.
A lot of rich people are so ugly and socially awkward they might be lonely. There’s no way I would want ugly baby Bezos at the game with me nor nerd face Suckabird. I bet they’d throw up after 5 beers and try and fuck a trash can
after getting a 20 bagger on her roblox and nvda calls , she better block that sht
I mean of course she's going to block it. Furthermore, Pelosi is only the 6th richest member of Congress? All that insider trading and she's not even the richest?
Buying leaps on tech calls isn't insider trading , it's just using a brain but apparently tons of people don't have them including me.
That bill literally only pertained to Billionaires. You think a bunch of people who call themselves autists and apes are going to be even remotely impacted by that?
Who woulda thought, SPY gonna go up 

AGAIN

What a wild idea

Stupid bulls I cannot wait for you to go broke when it finally crashes on all your bullshit
Funny how bears crawl out for ass drilling
Honest question, is all your “money” tied up in puts or do you have a “portfolio”?

Cause if you don’t have a portfolio then you are poor and should leave

Tesla will go up in pre-market and then tank so fucking hard ....
Idk why
Bc after major bearish news, every rally is a chance to buy a put.
insiders are selling shares for taxes.. not just musk
for taxes. lol. Kimbal Musk put down his bong and was like "oh shit, I'd better sell $100 million in stock so I can pay taxes on my shitty restaurant that I own, which probably loses money"

If TSLA could just immediately drill like 20% at market open, that'd be great. Doesn't have to stay there, but save my puts or I'm big fuk
fuk your puts bitch lol
True, just holding it is giving me an insatiable thirst for penis
Talking from experience: always buy deep ITM puts when playing TSLA. You never know when it hops back up. If you're forced to sell you basically trigger a short squeez at the expense of the other (few) TSLA bears
getting more CCJ

Watching The Wire for the first time
Enjoy!! I’ve watched it 11 times… definitely my favorite show of all time
I haven’t seen it either. Or GoT. Or Star Wars. Or the notebook. Or twilight
Just finished the third season in my first watch through last night. I'm really enjoying it. It's lived up to the hype for me so far.
Nice. I’m on the first episode right now. Have you watched The Sopranos?
Its the best...
Great show, def one of my all-time top 5 series
What are others in your top 5?
Breaking Bad

The Sopranos

Game of Thrones

The Americans

The Wire

I feel 'Oz' should get an honorable mention here since it used to be in my top 5 until GOT came out. Great show
I agree with all of these. The Americans is great and highly underrated
Sheeeeeeiiiiiit

VIX down 1  point today and hopefully more tomorrow so some of you guys can retire from Wendys.

The real question of today is simple.

Disney can't possibly go lower can it?
It absolutely can. I bought shares today though.
only themselves to blame, they made the last 3 Star Wars ...  not much left of the Disney brand name now. They living 100% on Pixar and Disneyland.

Sometimes when I'm in my dentist's office, they're watching HOME BUYER'S NETWORK TV or something, two handsome young yuppies running from house to house, looking to spend "only 850K" on a brand new house.

Why do they show that shit, man, it's depressing.
I'm a barista and my life partner creates floral arrangements. We are looking for something within our budget, about 900k, but we can stretch a little further if the right property speaks to us
Wtf I was just at the dentist today and they were playing that exact channel
I asked my lunch which way we going tomorrow and and the brats curved up.  It's a sign guys.  Buy spy calls!
I’m already looking for daily adrenaline rush

You know “journalists” and shorts have to be digging right now for any bad TSLA news to capitalize on as Musk sells.
#Pro tip


Only buy into companies that are failing, have poor revenue, and dilute their shares to trigger a ShOrT Squazozzle
My goal in life is to get Mohamed El-Erian's job and just go on CNBC and repeat what Powell/ journalists are saying about inflation or some shit.
Hotter with a mustache
I was gonna make a joke about it, but have seen his resume? It’s kind of insane.

Negates literally everything else on that page.
Wow.. SNDL getting delisted tomorrow

Closing a few $COST spreads in the morning, and probably buying $COST or $NVDA calls. 

Will also keep a close eye on $NET, $AMD and $INMD, to see what trend they may go in towards the next couple months, since I feel a potential bullish run is imminent with them before EOY.
COST $510 exp next friday right here!

Jk I almost bitched out at the end, but the only thing stronger then my faith in nvda is my actual retardation
Every day my account keeps from blowing up is a good day.
Sooo TSLA weak or good for tomorrow? Someone with more wrinkles then I care to let me know whether my 1140 Calls that expire tomorrow are fukt or not?

Why is this so funny
Alex, what is "mycotoxin poisoning"
1. The way he says moldy bread is pretty hilarious
2. I like how he qualifies that he bought it before it was moldy….. 
3. I am not sure what the fucking point was, also he is dead ass wrong, don’t eat moldy bread thinking it will fix you…
> 1. I agree with you, it is pretty hilarious
Shhhhhhhhh 🤫
‘From Walmart, before it was moldy’

Bruh I was dead lmao
Yeah, I lost it at that part too
This guys a legend check out his other videos
Bruh I’m in fuckin tears lmao

Not anorexic, but I like petite girls with nice bootys.
Are you into Japanese adult videos? *unsheathes collection*
I have been know to partake. A gentleman does not discriminate.

So you like a woman with an ass like a 10-year-old boy, is that right?
Nice try FBI.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, c'mon fellow Wall Street Bets ape guy! I'm one of you! Just another virile, red-blooded American man who likes petite, child-like butts, just like you said you like.

Did anyone see the pullback early this week, i was deep into calls and held thinking it would bounce, big mistake
Yes I did. I’ve been saying this since last weekend when the bill got passed.
It’ll bounce tomorrow. Hopefully you’re still holding

$SPY giving the naughty kids $500 this holiday 🎅
I need spy to $500by 12/15. Y’all make it happen
Can be done, just pray to the SPY gods

Is there a single decent youtube channel about the shit we do here?
I dont think brazzers has a youtube channel
What do you do here?
I wish I knew

Good start. Last video 15 months ago
No, I’ve not seen any Youtube channels about jerkin behind a Wendys.

Ah fuck, why does he have to curse my spy calls
Damn guess I’m buying puts at open
I’m on full tilt my ex left me what’s the play tomorrow any one on here make real money need a good trade
Jerk off, then decide
Weed something or spy calls after the dip
why the fuck is ark still selling pypl at 52w low
So they can buy quality companies like SNAP and HOOD
Buy high sell low.

That must the low
so they can buy high
Because they think it will go lower
I feel like I’m fucked on my take two calls. Goddamn wonky looking character models.
lol imagine thinking futures meant anything LOL
They give me something to watch while my portfolio is flat in the dark hours
How do you cope with selling too early? If I held a couple more days I could have made like 30k so far, which is a fuck ton of money for me I actually feel like head butting a wall
You get used to it after awhile. Its probably one of the bigger hurdles to overcome when trading cause it really makes you susceptible to fomo back in to chase some of that money you left and be left bag holding when the trend stops
if you survive long enough this is just something you will get over because it will happen constantly
don’t look at what you could have made, a gain is a gain
You remember the times you held too long and lost the whole investment and then you remember you never go broke taking profit
I mean you probably never really time the top you Always will BE to early/late
a bird in hand is worth two in the bush
You never lose money if you take profits.
Guys I’m going to sleep. Keep cheering for the market please. Keep it green. Peace!

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/HerrJemine123 (1/5) made a bet that GME would go to 300.0 when it was 212.0 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
The fact that Nikocado Avocado is still alive is DD enough to buy mcdonalds calls

But the moment he dies, puts on that shit
No moves Friday.  The US bond market was closed on Thursday.  I hate the fact boomers are pilling into bonds with 5% loss after inflation.  But the US 10 year moves markets.  Looking at either buying $PYPL on the dip or $GOLD Monday based on bond movements tomorrow.
I bonds
Do you think high inflation, chip shortage (will be for 2 years), high energy prices, and supply chain issues will cause a recession soon?
Short answer Yes.  But when is the $million $ question.  This feels like 2007 & 2001 combined.  Which means there is a ton of cash to be made before the blow off top.  But be prepared to cash out quick.
Agreed. This feels like 2007 with a lot more "now hiring signs" posted on businesses.
We didn't have free cash in 2007.  That's why I also feel like it's 2000.  This sounds crazy but I am also hoarding cash.  Half cash, half gambling in the markets.  It;s crazy times.
I think the rate hikes the Fed is going to be forced to do will. Which will then lead to super ultra mega QE.
Nah.  If inflation and a stagnant economy could occur at the same time, there would already be a term for it.   Of course no such word exists.
Isn't that the very definition of stagflation?
> Yes.
LOL
Speaking of stagflation...maybe shutting down another pipeline would be a good idea? The current administration has lived through what happens when there's a fuel shortage, he just can't remember.
Inflation (present and expected future) is part of cost of doing business. Be weird if a Fortune company somehow forgot to factor that into future cap ex. Same with energy prices. Chips shortages and supply chain should be old news. If you’re a Fortune company and you haven’t pivoted and navigated around by now, you need new management. 

That stuff, while still on the table, should already be under the “handled” column, not ohgodohgod time for massive layoffs.
I feel like the shortages and supply issues haven’t hit retail quite yet and the companies are trying to hide the reality of the situation. B2B right now is much more affected than B2C, it will come to B2C soon.
It's already priced in.  Until it's not.  The only think that will kill this bull market is for J-Pow to blink and raise rates.  Than I hope you don't have margin & have some cash.  The trend is your friend until it's the end.
In a rational world. But the market has not been guided by reality in some time.
No means gov support

I think we might be green tomorrow to start but red to end.
SPY short term downtrend isn’t gonna snap out of nowhere. I think we open red and slowly creep up to green. We’ll see though the next couple weeks will be telling
Ber is fak
Imagine being so retarded thinking SPY won’t hit $475 tomorrow being this green so early
Your retarded. We are lucky to break 472. Learn to use a chart u retard.
Ask u/danferindustries he thinks we aren’t breaking it.

Already did my TA calling out the bottom
I’m saying do your own ta. Stop going off other peoples words. Yes I’m gonna load up to the tits on 471 calls cause they are so cheap. Also see this hasn’t been the bottom, I’ve been around the block and caught a few falling knives in my time
You are arguing with a guy who’s life savings is tied up in FDs. All 3k of it…..

Nah, that’s just the nanobots getting comfortable
Take the penis out of your throat.
It was in there before I got the booster shot and I was fine
Nah, that's just due to SPY price action this week.
Pfizer and Moderna are just spike proteins, not live virus.  Your immune system is just strong and burning the invading proteins.  You’ll be fine in two days.

Lol. I dunno if you meant 11/17 or 11/19 but even those are at .01 and .02 respectively. By Monday they’ll both be at .01 and then they’ll stay there until they expire
I applaud your energy to post the amount of SPY $500 posts per day!!! Champ 👍🏻

/u/majorhassel (0/2) made a bet that SPY would go to 469.0 when it was 464.01 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Ok I’ll say it since nobody else will. I feel for you bud. Guh.
Today I realized it's been a year, give or take a few days, since I held 20,000 shares of MARA at \~$3

I made good money, but sure wish I held those.
I always love these feel good stories!
SPY will end around $466 tomorrow.
🔮
that'd be cool
Count it. I’m right most of the time.
Works 60% of the time, every time.
468
nope. guarantee I’m right. GUARANTEE.

Looks like a big green day all day long tomorrow. Straight up!
I have decided without further ado that since inflation has come out as trans, I will now be buying a few thousand dollars worth of ramen for 20 cents a pop and will watch my profits soar as high as a crow in 2030 when they are worth millions. I now not only trade cocaine but ramen futures too 🍜 📈 Literally cannot go tits up.

Nah that’s bad karma

>The Federal Reserve simply does not understand the risks of asset price bubbles and asset price collapses. It is clear from the data that they don’t get it. Greenspan could never make up his mind whether the market was overpriced – irrational expectations – or whether it was fine. Yellen couldn’t. Bernanke couldn’t see a housing bubble that was a 3-sigma 100-year event. Where were the statisticians? The answer is that the Federal Reserve statisticians do not do asset bubbles. They are, in that respect, utterly clueless – and we apparently never see that. We are willing to look through the crash of 2000, the housing crash – really dangerous affair – they didn’t do their duty, they didn’t head it off, they didn’t raise the limits for mortgages, they didn’t warn anybody, they allowed it to happen. Yes, they did pretty good in the decline. They were pretty good at applying bandages, and stimulus, and support for the wounded. But they sure as hell should not have allowed that housing bubble to occur.

>They don’t get it. They don’t see the risks, and they don’t see them now. And so this time, we don’t just have a housing bubble.
 "it's clear from the data!" But don't include any data.

No such thing is FDA approved, sorry to your friend.
what about not FDA approved.
Only If it has gene editing nano bots
The shitty thing about having a penis over 8 inches is that sometimes you like a gal but it's too much dick for her.

Look like yesterday🤧
Checks futures.   Up 0.07%.   Oh yes, very safe for calls.   What is the worse that could happen?   Another flat day like yesterday, then surely it will gap up over the weekend if it doesn’t rip today.    Nothing to worry about.
CNBC should be forced to work at Wendy’s and see what it’s like not even making 400k a decade. Fucking trash people living in white people wonderland. They might as well be in the metaverse already sniffing each other’s farts they are so out of touch with reality.
I’m white and grew up in a mostly white area and we were all poor as fuck. They aren’t in white people wonderland, they’re in retard-elite-dumbass-fucktard wonderland.

Great. Go buy some hogs and milk and you can open a sandwich shop.
You mean like Pork Belly futs?
Turning that WEAT into BREAD!

Downvoted for you missing the obvious pun.
There are no seats exposure stocks outside leverage companies that barely have exposure or two etfs that barely move.
No sure what you mean by "seats" but WEAT is an ETF... and it HAS been moving.

Ah, I think they call those people SRI (socially responsible investors). Agreed on that point then
lmao, imagine trying to call yourself socially responsible in a casino. too funny.
never been as bullish on a stock as I am on COIN ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)

Coin goes 400 but along the road it may dip harder than you think
So wtf RIDE is trying to do.. looks like it will fuck both calls and puts holder.
🕵️‍♂️ 🟥🟥🟥 tomorrow.
Lol
Hello fellow retarded monkeys.I got kicked in the balls by the Edgelord Musk by going hard in on Monday after the first dip and losing it all since the -12% tuesday crash.I want to jump out tomorrow, take the L and yolo it in puts against tesla. Why? Because fuck elon after this that's why.

Now the reason why I told you this : what's the most degen risky put you can think of ? Believe it or not so far I only bought calls, normal stocks and crypto. Never put.I want to yolo everything into the recovery failure of tesla the next weeks. I expect it to at least drop another 10%+.
“Failure of Tesla”….“drop another 10%”

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
recovery failure of tesla\* Oops
If you hate money, why don't you give it to your wife's husband?
A valid option I considered but I rather go 100% on a coinflip at this point  


I'm also holding 12000 Polygon with a 4.25% win the last day so I don't mind losing a lot.
You could buy the brze ipo instead and just make money off its pump and dump it day 2.
Brze? Can't even find it lol
It's IPO is in a few days, need to apply for shares.
[deleted]
Oh I would 100% not do this if it wasn't money that I was willing to risk in the first place.  
I got a feeling that Musk hasn't sold any shares after 9th November and is waiting for a little recovery so I rather not lose another huge chunk
since you haven't been right on it this week, doubtful that I will pay attention to you.

472 calls in SPY expiring tomorrow, how fucked am I?
Superfucked
What’s the price?
contract price was $13.64 (I know full retard for not closing earlier)😂. According to black-scholes, I would need to be 5 point ITM for it to even be break even now, but I'd settle for minimising the loss at this point
Oof, if those calls were for next week, you would be alright. But for tomorrow? RIP.
Is that a green boner, step SPY? Ew. You're supposed to be tanking ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)

Should’ve just bought a ranch upstate and lived a happy retired life like the other 08 shorters instead he can’t accept his best days in the world of finance are behind him and he’s stuck chasing that high from 08
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

RIVN long game and PLUG $60 calls for January
Lmao. The long game is already priced in .

How the fuck is it worth more than GM and Ford without any sales if it wasn’t
Eventually will run out of gas and the world will be covered in RIVIANs driven by men with large penises. But yes, priced right in
That would be nikola brand trucks. Sorry.
Really? I was wrong about RIVN thou… IDK about that PLUG.
I’m going deep for those $60 calls. It will happen, I’m manifesting it.

Real talk⁉️ 🤯
Fake news
It’s writing science fiction now, incredible
Wrong. It’s where we buy and sell 🐻 meat and fur after slaughtering them
Bear market is at least a 20% drop from near term highs.   The one I remember the most is the bear market from 2007 to 2009 which lasted 1.3 years and sent the S&P 500 down by 51.9%.  The U.S. economy had slipped into a recession in 2007, accompanied by a growing crisis in subprime mortgages, with increasing numbers of borrowers unable to meet their obligations as scheduled. This eventually snowballed into a general financial crisis by September 2008, with systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) across the globe in danger of insolvency.
Whoa. An actual quality post
Sorry.   Thought I was on another sub.

Prediction: Amazon, Tesla or Apple acquires RIVN in an all stock deal within a year.
Forgot Ford who actually built the pickups they delivered …
They won’t be able to afford them. It would be a merger not an acquisition and it would not be favorable IMO
Ford legacy costs vs Ford quick up scale production and global network.  And the family is still kinda around.  They could rage some shit together quick and get back in the game before going obsolete.
Family is not so bad IIRC. They are open to pivoting
EXACTLY.

Ford v Ferrari is some true shit.

Guys I'm trying to buy calls for the first time... any ideas or input is much appreciated
First one's free so literally anything
I see people say this a lot, but I don’t understand it. I’ve been investing for a bit but never have bought calls/puts. Everyone always says first one is free. Is this for everyone on most platforms?
lol it just means beginner luck
Yeah, think for yourself you 🐀 fuck
I'm trying to figure it out too. I tried to make a paper trading account on fidelity but it didn't work cause they want too much info from me. No good paper trading places to practice options so we are forced to practice using real money

I'm gonna wait till noon for that
So you've been hurt before too, I see.
PLUG has taken me further than any other stock but yes.. I've learned about the morning dips and red fridays. That said I think it's going to be huge in 2022-23.
I really hope I won’t wake up after going to bed today. Thought COVID would take me out, but it was the market all along.

Anyone buying the MAPS dip?
wow, under 10.  one of the only cannabis businesses that makes profit and incredible gross margins, and can scale as a SaaS business, but the market just doesn't like the stock.

I rode it from 12.5 to the mid 20s and made a bunch in it.  But I have also seen how retail just isn't into it, in spite of having a great meme stock profile
Generously applying the Martingdale strategy to $pypl
Same but it needs to stop around this price. Below is a bottomless pit going all the way to 170ish. I have plenty of Feb18 230 Leaps and plan to buy more tomorrow to DCA.

Took some 210c CAT calls end of day for my lotto.
MAPS 😱
I bought the dip hard. 

Bought the spac in the first 5 minutes a year ago at 12.5, rode all the way into the 20s, sold.

It's one of the most underrated stocks out there, and a steal at this price.  So many growth trends in one, very profitable, and yet it just hasn't taken off with retail.
I like where MAPS is going. But weed stonks won’t be moving for awhile until we here something about full legalization
unpopular opinion: MAPS investors shouldn't want full legalization.  Weedmaps was created to solve the problems of a hugely fragmented marketplace.
Gonna buy into this. Weedmaps charges out the ass monthly to be on there and their product is a website

Every 3 years AAPL drops in the spring. Its science. June 120P will print because things always totally repeat. But this time its prob a sales miss or shit forecast like they did in 2019 but this time prob do to a combo of supply chain issues, inflation making people buy less luxury items like apple shit resulting in missed sales est and lower revs vs expected. Thx you for coming to my ted talk.
Sup y’all? Was at a work event all day. Didn’t watch any of the market. What happened?
You probably just want to pull a double shift
Liar lol
Inflation situation feels like the China trade situation back in mid 2019. 

Markets care about it until they stop reacting to it.

At least that will be true unless it can be shown that JPow is wrong about transitory part of the story but that won't be confirmed until 3-4 more months pass and we start seeing if inflation will peak or not.

Fubotv Inc, went down 20% after earnings, they beat revenue and annual subscription rate. Loaded up today on strike 30 calls for Feb 22. This thing is way oversold atm.
Ticker is FUBO for all the autists that wont be able to find it without the ticker symbol
Lol. You really think this has legs? Funny is the definition of a sideways stock
I mean most analysts most pessimistic value is 30-37$ for FUBO. They are growing users and revenue with every quarter. This quarter companies have been dumping 20-50% for a few cents miss on eps, they will recover within a month. Also from a technical point, this is a big gap down from 34$ to 26$ that will get filled easily within the next few weeks.
This is the move.  Wasn’t even phased at the -20% just didn’t understand it lol
fuck now the question becomes, sell blnk calls at open or try to ride them higher.
It will go up more tomorrow, (not financial advise) but their earnings was pretty good and people outside of the US usually don’t have access to Pre/After market. That’s why I think it will continue to go higher tomorrow but do as you wish, congrats on the play retard.
why do you say not financial advice?
Because if you listen to me and end up homeless having to give blowjobs behind Wendy’s for a dollar you can’t hold me accountable, pretty much.
i couldnt hold you accountable anyway, why would you think i could?
> I'm sorry.
The reason why I say not financial advice is because of a habit I have whenever I give my opinion on stocks and crypto, basically anything investing related, is because I don’t want to risk being held accountable if you listen to me and it doesn’t work out. It seems that you know that it’s silly to say such a thing but in all seriousness, some people might listen to it and take my “advice” and blame me for the shit their decision caused. That’s why.

My 477c hope so!
Gawd dayum, 11/12 477c.  Even I wasn’t that bullish
Yeah sure. By tomorrow
Yeah
Yes, there is a chance. We'll probably get our mid month pullback, but if it's not severe then SPY should hit 470 by then easily.

It might hit 470 tomorrow. Depending on yields and misc news.
It better fucking not! Sold my 470c expiring tomorrow for a loss.
It's a toss up.

Spy climbed over $1 after hours on no news and futures are green so far. We'll probably open green, but who knows what happens.

I like how google now reports a 70% earnings beat on TLRY last reported earnings, whereas they reported like a 3% beat on the day earnings were released.  When did they change from -.08 consensus like before earnings to -.23 as of now?
Tlry fucked up by providing wrong info during earnings then updated later in the day, 100k of my calls fucked, TLRY could've move up 20% with that huge beat. I resent them so fucking much.
I mean I lost $250k in 2 days there so I feel you.  Just feels a little convenient.

whats a more important metric when concerned about wage increases, cpi or inflation?
Big Mac index
Paycheck and big mac price
Inflation/deflation is the difference in the CPI today vs. the CPI from this time last year. If you’re asking about wages in one point of time, then CPI. If you’re asking about wage increases compared to a previous point in time, then inflation.

Delusions of Grandeur - Burry, An Autobiography 

         Excerpt from page 234, Paragraph 2, Line 3;          

“ It was in 2021 when I decided to start my transient form, I cut my penis off in my garage with a sterile knife and mailed it to Jerome Powel. I only wrote on a piece of paper “Witness Me”.”

Pretty sure this was a ban bet in 2020
controversial opinions: we already have american socialism for private industry. bailing out the masses instead of private industry would benefit pretty much everybody. stock market communism for big business is an extension of worker owned and operated business, which is the healthiest form of small town capitalism.  america has been duped into trickle down and when trickle up would suit our human needs far greater.
Counterpoint: Fuck Socialism. SPY 🚀. Everyone wins. fin
The funniest part about socialists is that they don’t buy stocks, which would literally allow them to control the means of production. If you’ve watched everyone in society and the government bend over backwards to raise stock prices, but refuse to learn how to buy them yourself, you kind of deserve what’s coming to you. It’s like the travel agents that saw Expedia replacing them, but decided to try to use the government to protect their jobs instead of investing in the company themselves.
no but what im saying is that the market allows for a form of socialism that-- god damn it nevermind. sanders owns stocks you idiot.
It was all over for America when we started implementing Entry Drafts in our sports leagues.  That's how the communism got in.
no but what im saying is communisim-- nevermind.

Do technicals work on ETFs? Serious question? S&p is hundreds of companies price action on one chart. How can it be interpreted the same as any one company's technical patterns?
I have no fucking clue I’m retarddd
Same. That's why I ask. I need to hear from the non retards are here. There's gotta be one or two that haven't got full retard yet.
/u/Jjd1226 does some good TA on SPY. he would probably know the answer to that question
https://ibb.co/dBqtBwt

Yes
I use TA on QQQ all the time so…no. RSI is probably more useful; buy when it hits 30, short at 75+.
S&P bounces on MA50 on daily chart and usually drops when RSI indicates overbought or vice versa. It’s an ETF but it’s tradable and have a large volume of algorithms trading it.
everything is correlated

George Clooney's best role was in Michael Clayton in 2007, which I highly recommend it's a great film.

But those tits should have gotten first billing
He wouldve been great as bond
Damn yeah he would've and I would've liked to see it now that I think about it but I love the Daniel Craig bond

Does Clooney have the action skills?
Poor action skills, he bombed as batman
If they made a spy-drama or spy-mystery version of james bond rather than a spy-action then yeah idk if I could think of a better fit than Clooney
Before daniel craig, james bond was not so action oriented
That's not necessarily true imo it was still action oriented just not so rough and rugged

But also imo the james bond role was only halfway good before Craig made it actually good. Henry Cavill would be the ideal successor for keeping the role as suave and badass as Craig I think
Nah he can't pull off a tough guy vibe well.
> No. He is a terrible actor and would be very bad as bond

When everyone finds out that Crapto is a Chinese long con built entirely upon the debt of Chinese real estate developers who are now defaulting.. what do you think the implications will be?
There’s so many amazing points to break down the problems with that space as a speculative market and you picked the most baseless retarded tinfoil hat conspiracy
I know right… that shit is Q level
Nah I saw his reply I interpreted it wrong he mentioned the non realized backed balance and washing through that fake Chinese “bank” we can’t mention here
Naw bro there is solid evidence Tether which the entire crapto market is built upon is a huge ponzi scheme backed by Chinese mortgage bonds debt just like the US did in 08 only without the crypto element.

Tether has paid out 1 billion in fines so far for lying about their books
I’m not saying what your saying is not true. 

I’m saying is that it might be bailed out if not already
They'll kick the can as long as they can to create as many bagholders as they can, but the reckoning is coming and soon

And it's certainly not q level conspiracy. 1 billion in fines from oversight companies who are balls deep in fraud themselves tells me this is just the tip of the iceberg.
I doubt it. But we shall see
I think corn goes 80k than rugpulled to 5k when the world becomes aware
I think everyone knows and doesn’t care
Nah people are blissfully ignorant just throwing money at shitcoins left and right. 95% of the public hasn't the first clue they are investing in Chinese scams
I’ve alerted the institution that you escaped again
I think the implications will be that you still won't be flexible enough to suck your own cock
That's what I have you for
The problem is, I cost money, and you lost over 150k on GME options because you're fucking stupid
I'm actually breakeven on my GME options, again I lost the farm on Lucid options pre merger.

I've only ever made money on GME, even after holding too long this week, still up 4k on the week.. I was up 50k tho.. stings
> I've only ever made money on GME

So just curious - how does it feel knowing your blind faith is costing you hundreds of thousands of dollars?

How does it feel knowing that SMART people are actually playing the peaks and valleys and farming you for money?
I'm still up on the play, one of these days diamond handing those options will buy me a house. Everyone will sell for a 10 bagger and I'll make a 1000 bagger 

Only need to be right and hold on 1 time
I asked you a question.
Shots fired ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
A lot of Chinese stocks for fake companies.
What’s crap To?
Shitcorn and the like
I saw your reply but it got deleted by auto mod for content mentions I assume, I see we agree on the similar basis of its main problem but not the implications, never mind lmao carry on
Not too much different than buying all these Chinese stocks like BABA. You don’t get voting rights or even real ownership of the company.

Wsb: chasdaq fut mooning 
Me: checks futures and no change

5 sec later

Me: checks futures, still the same
Bruh it’s drilling to the moon
Everything here is leveraged like an option. You should know this.
Spy was +.27% and now is .12%. How is that the same to you
Hahahha I thought I was loosing my mind or missing something but maybe futures really were just staying the same
Cramer in CNBC basically said everything rally starts now 🚀
Fuk then we crash
The only schmuck bigger than Cramer is someone 
listens to him
Got it, short everything.
Cramer is just the Leonardo Dicaprio of CNBC
In what way?! The only fathomable way would be in cocaine use, and I think Leo might actually be the Jim Cramer of Hollywood in that case.
I really wanted to make this connection but couldnt think of a punchline.  Just a lazy joke with no punchline.
Lol, well you tried
Bro China is a problem, like a when in the big short they book tickets to go to Florida problem. That shit is drastic and the theory is proven by the supply chain issues.
What is the theory?
He has no idea
it's a problem with in a problem
Fuck. I hate college. The only thing I think about now is gpa.
Your GPA doesn’t matter in the “real” world
But matters to get into job interview
Imagine someone asking to see your grades for a job lmao
Got big D
Unless you come from a tier 1 college.

If you want to go to grad school it’s really the only situation that really matters
Women love grades? I thought big D’s are good for grad school![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)

If we go off of charts alone, the market is about to roll over for a blood red day tomorrow. After that rebound probably likely.
AAPL looking kinda juicy at 147
Bullish on SARK

Tbh the ultra low volume today worries me
Bond Market closed for Veterans Day

Only reason why
Ah that would make sense
Tsla price predictions tomorrow ??
980
WTF makes someone wake up in the morning and decide to short $20M in a stock? Nothing, that's what. Some shitty computer probably made that decision. I will avenge my calls by waging war against the thinking machines like the Butlerians of old in Dune!
Got in cheap at spy 500c for 12/31
Been holding 470 since mid October, we'll likely see another rally before new years

Most boring day ever
The volume was spectacular
Which way is Tesla going, boys? 🧐🧐
Up
which way? to the moon of course.
Down then up
I know Disney plus kind of blows but to think Disney and Netflix have basically the same valuation is bonkers to me. Disney is a monopoly entertainment giant plus boomer assets, merch sales, parks, espn. Maybe I’ll actually buy shares.
DIS has a lot of physical assets that are hard to move during a supply chain bottleneck

NFLX is purely digital and isn’t affected by jack shit
Keep in mind I’m a moron. But their physical assets are parks and resorts mostly right, sure the supply shortage affects merch and perhaps expansion. I suppose they do have a huge footprint with branding stuff, I did see a waffle iron of Mickey Mouse at Walmart the other day.
I heavily increased my position in SNDL at these after hours prices based on that leak going around 🤡
It’s one guy saying there’s a leak who won’t provide a link u r fuk
That's what makes it a leak
He said the leak was from cardinal, lmao good luck my man
Idk what cardinal is but the guy posting the leak seemed like a quality retard so I took a leap of faith on his judgment
I am in SNDL too but leaks are always bs
The content of the leak sounds like absolute fucking bs to me, but there's just something about the way it was presented that feels so reputable and trustworthy
Look at JUSHF
What is the supposed leak?
Big money and expansion into the US
millions of PFE vaccine orders incoming.

Diagonally.
Did you say Diagon Alley
Seriously why is there no info about $aal anywhere? Volume was at 18mil today, next weeks calls top the charts for open interest, and someone bought like 2.5mil of stock at 21.50. What’s about to happen? About to yolo my Christmas money on calls
Market is already up 33 percent YoY 

Just go to your intraday graph, and zoom OUT
More like 28%… exactly one year ago we had just dumped 6% off election fears
fair enough.

Angus Young is only 5'2".
YTD Palantir is -2,45%, what a disappointing shit, even all indexes outperformed this stock. I guess people will wait 50 years to finally get a return on this lol.
I loaded up at 18 and love it
Better than DIS
“It’s a long term investment”, “shares are on sale today!” and other bagholding shit.
this bounce gonna dump tomorrow? thoughts? i think its gonna keep rallying
Hitting 480 by December for sure
Everything rally combined with Santa claus rally 🚀
PSFE fucked me today
Pay UnSafe
"Nine Bipartisan US governors press U.S. lawmakers to pass 52 Billion semiconductor funding bill. Taiwan unreliable potentially trillions at risk"

\- This may take one or two years. If INTEL doesn't fucked up as they have been, this might become one of the biggest players in the US market again.  INTEL STOCK GONNA SOAR IF THIS GOES THROUGH...
They need to get TSM in the US ASAP. It’s so important I’m almost willing to go help them build for free lmao. Idk why everyone is so slow.
TSM is a taiwann semiconductor company. They want a US own company I think.
If you want the best get the best. Go big or go home. Intel needs to step it up too
I'm rooting for them. So sad they aren't getting there much recognition the once had.
It’s definitely a shares play with intel but you will make free money holding long term.
Gonna put $20kb into this shit 6 months from now once I make more money from stocks
This has been in the works for a while. Same thing is happening with rare earths.
Looking at RIDE today - “oh wow RIDE is finally catching a break”

Lisa su got me so hot right now
Where are all the RIDE bag holders?  Fucking douche bags probably masturbate to limp biscuit.
Lmao punching air while I anxiously wait to cash out my 6.5 puts i bought
I almost bought those. Went with GOEV puts. They bounced too much on the bill. ER should be a reality check.
They're not gonna make any money til like 2024 according to them, bunch of delusional fucks buying that trash
I masturbate with hot dog flavored water.
Reasons why I very rarely bet bearish. When I do I sell way fucking early for pennies, or I hold overnight like the QQQ puts I bought today, and instead of taking 20% gains just before close I'm looking at getting fucked tomorrow.

I lose this gamble and I vow to be a perma-bull retard full time again.
Jobs numbers tomorrow might be good for you and I
Hope so. For the first time this year my fun-folio is more bearish than bull. 50% shares, 15% QQQ puts and YANG calls, 25% cash, 10% leaps on some beaten down companies that should bounce eventually.
Me too. Never held puts longer than a day and I’m really regretting it. We’ll see tomorrow.
Biden 'Inflation is good sign, shows strong economic recovery.'
Seasonality says we've yet to see the dip. I'm holding long calls for the new year and short dated puts into the weekend .. if 463 breaks tommorow we could bounce off another support before the end of the year take off no?
You sound scared.

You good bud?
I'm mean it's been a bloody few days hahaha
We’re due for a Green Day hopefully tomorrow delivers. Praying for my $471 calls
You had one today. +.04%
No. That’s terrible that’s not a spy Green Day. I mean the REAL green day
That resistance at $471 is stupid 5 times and it goes a little bit over into a bullish sentiment and then pullback. I swear we’re driving through an LA I5 traffic jam market right now. Stop. Go 70 mph. Lead foot on brakes. Zoom to 80.
Time to see my Costco 520 by 11/12 banbet get won tomorrow.
Hello
If China is able to prevent the big 🌈 I'll be more excited than Prince Andrew at a Hot Topic.
My biggest concern tomorrow will be attempting to sell my 11/12 $5 WISH puts for more than 0.01. And then I'm gonna need shares to tank a dollar or so for my 11/19 puts, but I guess I have a week for that to happen. But then I'm gonna need it to raise up to, say, 4 bucks to $8.40 so I can get rid of my bags. Piece of cake, c'mon.
what in the fuck kind of strategy are you doing m8
“strategy”
is this r/boardgamesfornerds ?

Reverse cowgirl into the wheelbarrow.
Then wheel her to the dung heap
Too many - heres the weirdest 10,000 FXPO shares ( Ukrainian iron ore )
That brings back some memories. I had loads of those in 2007/2008 when they fell to 25p. I sold them at 40p and was pretty happy lol... seeing them now in the 300s makes me laugh. I had no patience back then.
Lol I have no patience either - I was gonna short then if Russia invaded - when they didn’t I bought instead ffs
What about Ukrainian Uranium?  So they have that?
Only hidden Soviet missiles
500 GME here 

And i ain't selling 

Not till I'm homeless 😎🚬
Damn 500?  That sounds like a lot of money
Nah :/

What do you think?
China owns the deathstar, technically.
If you mind the plague fleas then yes
i have a feeling my amd 144p are fucked for tomorrow lol
AH looks good. I've got a 143 and 150 expiring tomorrow. Im sure I'll end up red before close.
Why are they fucked? AMD is at 148
my luck is all my shit gets fucked  so im sure amd will set a record tomorrow lol
i fucked up meant 144p lol
You think PLTR predicted what dog shit their own stock became.

Not to invest or place calls on SOFI
Hate to say it pal, but a sideways chart like that are people slowly handing out bags to willingly gullible investors.

It’s gapping down hard tomorrow.

Really really hard
Um... I said, NOT to invest or place calls in SOFI. I got out at a loss already. Whether is goes up or down, I'm good at this point.

calls on spy?
surely today is the day that Ford bounces back and my $20.50 calls print instead of expiring worthless, right? 

right? :( 

being too hungover to sell on Wednesday was my first mistake. Seeing those calls yesterday afternoon at .05 down from .68 a few days ago and saying, "fuck it, what more can they do to me? might as well hold this bag" was my second mistake 

but surely today is the day that I start making money again. Between Ford and fucking Palantir shitting, it's not been a good week for me

If you aint in plug calls, you dont like tendies
Poll time: upvote if I should buy SPY calls tmrw or downvote for puts. It’s going to be an 11/12 expiry day trade. Risky but I’m ready.
You’re too late. Spy gap up tomorrow already happening, you’ll be slaughtered
What are your moves tomorrow?

Watch my reasonable calls expire worthless because Tesla dicksucks pumped a consequential stock up so far beyond reasonable values that it’s unsustainable, and because of a god damn Twitter poll. 

Thanks dipshits and gay bears. Congrats. And fuck you.
> Tesla is a company that creates and sells electric cars. It has been on the stock market for over ten years, but it only recently became popular with investors because of its CEO Elon Musk's personality and his many crazy tweets.
Seems like as good a reason as any to pump a stock in 2021. Ultra doveish monetary policy and all that
I love you, visualmod. Fuck you. But I love you.
it’s gonna fly tomorrow tho
Spy already gapping after hours. 465-466 calls will print in am
honestly probably will in the AM, but I would sell then
Can’t tell if this is a joke. Gapping up? It’s not even anywhere close to breaking out of the range it was stuck in all day lol
Lol
Since I started playing markets (3 weeks) I can feel myself getting more conservative by the day.  I'm scared of me
There are times to be aggressive and times to be conservative.   Always consider the other side when developing your strategies.
Shut uppp. Im as liberal as it gets but this is a casino for smart people, not gonna sit and watch when its always mooning just because i want the rich to get taxed more lmao. No one cares about our 10k gains makin 40k a year.
Tlry goes up $0.65 and the pot heads lose their minds, lay off the tree, ya can't handle it obviously.
I think we will be red tomorrow. So, perhaps I should buy calls
What are you basing this thinking off of?
Lack of positive market sentiment or positive catalysts combined with the fact that we still haven’t pulled back even 2% from ATH after that insane runup over the last few weeks, the lower highs and lower lows all day today. I just feel like we may drop a bit more tomorrow/Monday before we get back to busting through ATH’s
I think the market will have a decent pull back sometime before Thanksgiving, until then, SPY could continue going up toward 469
If we follow seasonality then next week we should see some red. Maybe even up through Thanksgiving. But then we’ll probably have our Santa rally to break ATH and beyond
shut up. just shut the fuck up.
Good luck guy
Sure hope you’re right lmao

To make good on his Twitter pledge, Mr. Musk likely would need to sell more than 12.5 million additional shares, valued at more than $13 billion at today’s close.

Those sales were just Monday. He most likely sold the rest Tuesday but we didn't get a new form 4 today since the SEC was closed due to a federal holiday.

Sometimes I think back to when I bought like 2 oz of MDMA with 🌽 on the dark web when 🌽 was like $150 and get real sad.
I know the feeling, used to buy LSD on the Silk Road when it was like $110, actually had like 3 coins in a wallet on my old laptop that I forgot about and it got thrown out when I got a new comp. Didn’t remember until a few years ago when it popped above 10k for the first time and everyone was talking about it and I said to myself “I fucked up”

We've had inflation for awhile now, it didn't start in oct, just got worse and outta control.

Yesterday morning I was on r/HolUp subreddit and saw video of this chick masturbating when he Lil bro walk in and hand her a caprison while she was buck naked. Last night, I spent 10 min trying to find it again, but I could so I decide to Google "girl masturbate while lil bro give her caprison" and it took me to this weird porn site. I click on it and half of the shit on there were beastiality.... It was the first time I ever seen beastiality and I'm very traumatized ever since. Wtf...people
Links?  For research purposes
Of the caprison bitch or beastiality?
I’m not picky
Bro just google what I googled. The website was fenme or something along that line. Knock yourself out!

You do realize the words you put in google search engine might have put you on a watch list? Smh Those words could have taken you to illegal website. Dummy
Well shit. I don't watch illegal porn. They can keep watching me cuz I aint into that shit
Thats not the point. Those specific words dont paint a nice picture. Next time think!!!
You're right. I wasn't thinking, but I will from now on. I might be a degen, but I'm not that low.
there are so many lists at this point it hardly matters.
Does not matter unless you are uploading. Nobody is getting arrested for browsing illegal shit. You have to be the one sharing it

We are ready for launch! SNDL is finally going somewhere.
Tomorrow is the first time I won't think about buying more but instead I will browse and decide which lambo I will buy
There is no fucking way they pulled 550m revenue what’s the source

$PSFE Buy dips
I don't understand how folks play earnings.  Buy a call, price goes up, IV falls out, you lose money.  Buy a put, IV drops, you lose money.  Its like you with 5x or lose money fantastically.  I mean I love a good lottery, but.... what am I missing
Somebody show this poor fucking soul what spreads are...... Jesus fuck
Buy calls on a dip for a month out two weeks before earnings.  Then sell at least half before earnings on the run up.
Because if you buy far OTM FDs they already have little value to begin with and if you get it right you make a ton. I remember For example I got Domino’s pizza calls for 0.21 and after earnings they got ITM and I sold them for 5. I would just not go all in because of what you mentioned, if the move is too small the IV will fuck you.
Seems like Theta gang is the only folks that profit here.
I think it's more that people are never happy with taking 50% on a play because they are always chasing 500% on a play and then end up with nothing.
If people weren't so chicken shit and multiplied their position size instead of hoping for the 500%+ on 1 OTM contract they would actually make money. This and also being cheap with entries. Need to spend money to make safe money otherwise you are praying for a lottery to hit.
Yep, can confirm. Had GME calls that 9x’d in august and wanted the satisfaction of a 10x. Later sold at a loss like a true autist
I do debit spreads on both sides to take iv crush out. I don’t get doubles or triples, but it’s nothing to get a quick 5-10%.
This is the way if you're doing a directional play.
If the stock makes a big move then your calls/puts go ITM and print hard.
The idea is that the stock will move enough to cover for IV and IV will cool off by mid day, or if she earnings the next morning 

Some times it works, about 6% of the time. Usually doesn't of course.
why not just buy shares to be safer on earningS?
Because you make more money if you're right. It's also cheaper most of the time. So thats why it's so popular
But ITM
u play earnings that u think will fall outside of the implied move.
You do debit spreads.

1. Have a margin account.
2. You think your stock, that is at $45, will rally to $50.
3. Buy the $48 call for $75 each.
4. Sell the $50 call for $25 each.
5. You've now spent $50 per spread with a max gain of $150, best case scenario the stock blows past $50 and you get $200 for every $50 spread you bought.
6. Preferably, after step one do it again picking the right direction.

Note: the spread insulates you against volatility to an extent, because the rise in your IV is offset by the rise in the call you sold. Same for time exposure.
Buy a week before earnings on a red day, then sell day of.
Check out IV on expiry a few weeks past earnings.
Anyone think recovery stocks are about to skyrocket these next 3 months

I'm serious this time.

Is there any reason why SPY pumping AH like this? Or is this just a fake pump that's gonna fade at open tomorrow?
SPY in bull flag pattern this week. This is the breakout rally
More people are buying than selling.
[deleted]
Shares are always available
Option a) This is a pump to short and it will drop hard by ~9:30pm .. option 2) it’s legit, we open over 4655 on /es.. and we get to go up into a green pre-opex Friday, which is common enough to expect. Look at how we open to figure it out.
No reason

Wait how are over 1000 people dying daily to covid, still??? Is the vaccine not working or something
You are a genuine retarded idiot.
Retards are still scared of getting it
What? If 1000 died of it, it's because they did get it.
I was talking about the vaccine I see now how I was unclear
Ahh, I see. Not a problem. Just got confused, thought I was on /r/cuckservative for a second.
happy cake day. i like your username. fuck you.
They aren’t getting their shots is my guess
It works but people r dum
Pretty sure I have COVID right now

I have a cough and can’t taste or smell 🤷‍♀️
Did you get vaccinated? Just wondering, not judging.

If so, one or two vaccinations?
I got Moderna…Finished the second dose beginning of March.

But to be fair, I have a shitty immune system and have to get allergy shots every 4 weeks 🤷‍♀️
Still: the fact that double vaccine seems to have worn off :o . I know people who have double doses Pfizer and they got covid too... why is this becoming increasingly common
It mutates at a high rate. So we’ll definitely be seeing it frequently and we will probably have to get annual shots (like the flu vaccine) to prevent different strains
1000 people In a population of 350 million Is literally insignificant.
Unless it's your mother.
everything that would kill you regularly kills you faster with covid. counts as a covid death.
Vaccine is not a cure. Plus people with the vaccine can still get the virus and give it to others with the same viral load as an unvaxxed individual
Aoc is more educated in economics than the majority of the retards here. How does that make you feel?

No she’s not, she’s fucking dumb. I watched one of her twitch streams and can confidently confirm that she must have sucked off the professor to graduate
Not much, though I agree she's slightly more educated than the idiots here.
That qualified her to tend bar.
Now she's a Congresswoman and you're just some dude in a subreddit where people light their money on fire
That explains a lot about the countries economic policy.

What’s a good entry point for TSLA shares now ? Under 1k?
350
600
Anything sub $1000 is a gift from heaven imo
550.

Whether we get there in the next few months is a different question.
I personally feel like people are really attached to TSLA above 1k now and there will be tons of resistance below that level.
420.69 of course!
Psfe!! Lol

Just cuz it beats doesn't mean the stock will go  up. Did AMD moon after earnings?
Calls all day long.
Calls here too. A lot of analysts have increased their PT for the stock, most predicting 320-340.
Buy puts so it moons ty
I am
do you have a thesis or just a hunch?
Thesis is that even the chip makers are experiencing shortages, I find it hard to believe there going to be up 10% in revenue Q over Q and based on its massive run in the last 2 months even a slight miss will make this dump 10% more if its a good miss.
not one chip maker has missed tho so idk.. can't make my mind up :(
For those wondering (DIS call holders) what Disney+ day is, here ya go:

Honestly don’t think any movement comes from this, it mainly seems like fan service with new trailers and shit. That being said historically DIS has never not ripped back from a dip of this size, but that was with big nuts Bob Iger. The new CEO Bob Chapek seems like a total dipshit who I wouldn’t be surprised is ousted after one more shit earnings quarter.

They're even cancelling stocks now. RIP $PSFE. held in my heart and folio for eternity to come.
I bailed. $13k loss. Fucker has been slow bleeding and I’ve bought every goddamn dip until now. I’m sure it was a bad call but when you look at your stock and it’s the #1 traded stock today and biggest loser….it’s time to end that shitty relationship.
considered it, just cant stomach it...i'll hold these bags for now but fuck man today was brutal and soul crushing. Sorry bro that's a solid chunk of a loss and im probably looking at much more rn so can't pull the trigger.
Yeah I bet I’ll regret it. Did the absolute #1 thing you’re not supposed to do. But to me the opportunity cost if holding this cash and hoping one day I’ll get back to break even (let alone profit) made me pull out the remaining $8.5k and toss it into QQQ and Lucid. At least I know one of those will grow!
So I’ve “played” two earnings this week where I buy a fairly OTM contract on a volatile stock on a dip and by the end of the day both have been up 50-60% solely from iv spikes pre earnings. I sell before close and sleep fine. What am I missing about this? Obviously if it was that easy everyone would be rich. How can this go wrong?
Works til it doesn’t. Stock could go in opposite direction and you lose delta pricing
TLDR
Like dude below said, works till it doesn’t. This is one of the first “always wins money” plays new traders hit upon.. I was you 2 years ago 😂
yea don't fall for this.  It works until it doesn't.  The next thing you know you are down 35% 10 minutes before close talking yourself into holding through earnings.
What is wsb's realistic market cap?
50 billion if we re brand ourselves as an EV company
Lets just say , it used to be a lot higher than what it is today

$1.5T USD by 2023 with the current rate of inflation
Same as my TSLA $1200C 11/12

I can make a separate post on it but at $4.26 everyone should buy as much $PSFE as you can afford. Absolute worse case scenario is you sell it in the mid $5 tomorrow for 20% gain. 

What is more likely is that they are bought VERY soon. Their assets far outweigh their share price and their volume of transactions is up 19% this quarter. They are massive prime target for a takeover. 

Conference call starts at 4:30 EST. Can't imagine that hurting the price any more than the 42% crash today.

If retail pressure pushes this back over $7, there is potential for a $12-$15 spike.

remember that with DASH, a company that loses exponentially more as it grows and does not achieve any economies of scale - growth should be considered bearish, not bullish

Whoever is holding their lucid shares past earnings, I urge you to use this strategy.

So much bear sentiment for LCID even though it’s up 90% in a month 😂 whole way through 30,35,40 … now it’s post earnings. I’m LCID long and let’s go for $50 onto $60 next week!!!
Close to being 90 RSI, I'm not a lucid bear but you'd be dumb not to mitigate your risk if you went through that lucid sell-off when merger happened
im thinking about buying $LCID puts for earnings monday. only 12 cars manufactured, expensive as shit, supply chain issues, $70B+ MC already. or is the market just too retardd to react rationally. idk
Any forecast might push it higher
How many cars they actually manufacture?
everything you said is common knowledge so what makes u think it'll suddenly become relevant after earnings ?
Because that's the way this clown market has been going all year. We switched to buying the news now.
PLTR is on sale right now. Easy 6%
Let's go, spy calls!
Not until Black Friday.
it angers me deeply that SNDL is still mentioned here. How come you idiots can't do 10 minutes of DD and realize what a scam that stock is
Just because it's a scam doesn't mean you can't make money on a P&D with a little luck
The real PnD phase was back in January when the company had to have their share price above $1 for x amount of days to avoid being de-listed. They capitalized on meme stocks/social media to pump SNDL and achieve that. Then they announced their plans to issue 1 billion shares.

This stock is unlikely to make you good returns, any returns are based off greater fools coming into the fold.
I rode that stock from 2 dollar to zero glad I sold
I rode it from .50 to 3.80. I’m a buyer at .40 see ya there!
yeah and Kudos to you! I assume this was back in January? My buddy bought at 0.60 and eked out a profit, but I just stayed out completely because I didn't agree with the bull case
Was! Analysts have largely switched their position to a buy rating. The dd is actually pretty solid now.
Dude look at the actual numbers. Look at their market cap vs their revenue and revenue growth. Sure the weed market will grow but what's their MOAT? 

This stock is unlikely to make you good returns, any returns are based off greater fools coming into the fold.
we don't have a supply shock, we have a demand shock from all the money printing. supply chains are overwhelmed because everyone is flush with cash and buying way more shit than before the pandemic. The fed is trying to bullshit everyone into thinking supply chains are functioning at a lower capacity than before but they are actually functioning at a much HIGHER capacity. And once the economy gets going again money is going to come off private balance sheets inflation will get worse and worse. eventually stonks will realize this, anticipate fed tightening, and crash.

From Bridgwater:

https://www.bridgewater.com/its-mostly-a-demand-shock-not-a-supply-shock-and-its-everywhere
As much as I respect Ray Dildalio, my man’s thinking reasonably when the market is high off coke supplied by powman’s printer
the rational play is to bet on the coke rampage and then bet on the comedown
I don’t think that’s entirely true. We know of many parts of the supply chain that are not operating at levels they were a few years ago. 

If it was strictly demand, we would see the same numbers of containers being unloaded from ships as we did in 2019, for example. 

Also we can see the labor shortage everywhere. Just go ask anyone in any service industry.
While I agree this makes sense from a retail standpoint, it doesn't seem to account for all the issues from a corporation standpoint.

Supplies *are* limited. At my company, we are not buying more supplies (and neither are our competitors or sister companies), we simply cannot get in our *normal* level of supplies. Our company wasn't really affected during the peak of the pandemic, we are only now feeling the issues.

These are not supplies being bought by retail, these are raw material goods. There are issues with production of actual supply (do to labor) and logistical issues (due to supply chain constraints).

It's really probably both. We have supply chains that are working at a high capacity, but there are limited goods due to labor and transportation limitations. Couple that with high demand due to money printing, and that's a disaster waiting to happen.

My company issued our budget for the year, and they are expecting big growth, yet also recognizing the supply issues at hand. Many companies are probably doing the same. And by the time everything works its way out many companies will probably have to issue new guidance and lower expectations for the year when sales inevitably fall. It's could get bad over the next 12 to 16 months.
Hemorrhaging money on my 85x SPY $500C 12/31 ...lost 2k in a week on them but still up.  Gonna hold for two more weeks as SPY rebounds to ATH.  500 price point may not be feasible at this point so will sell early for 5k to 10k.  Any advice from apes that hold long positions in SPY is welcome.    TIA.

I am considering creating an EV startup that will make off-road vehicles. As far as I know no other EV company has plans to enter this market, so I will be the first. I won't actually have any tech or product of course, but I will non-stop talk about the huge future opportunities. After registering the company, I will try to immediately make it public at a mere 10 billion valuation, which is a big discount considering the huge bubble we are in. I mean, my company and Rivian will both have 0 dollars revenue, but my company will be 10x cheaper. When the company becomes public, I will cash out 80 percent of my shares for "liquidity" reasons( like buying lambos and mansions) and let WSB and soyboys all over the world to hold my bags. Anyone here wants to be an early investor?

yup looking pretty bearish for Tesla today
not only today... it’s still way to overvalued... will go down to 900 and maybe further
well I have calls expiring today so after that I couldn't care less. gonna lose thousands today :)
Maybe sell at open to try and cut your losses?

if you’re lucky there will be a spike up, then i would sell... but after that it’s over... only my own opinion

Blankety saying “INSIDERS ARE SELLING TSLA” is getting repetitive and stupid. It’s been in the headlines all week.
Before I mentioned Cardinal bank raised SNDL target to $7 in the leak, and goldman hadn't given a number yet, now they have come out with a $5 target.

Looks like we should expect a good earnings and growth today.

$500 million revenue, 1500 new retail partnerships in western US is most of that, $15 million grant from state government for eco friendly technology use. It's looking great.
I asked for a link for the revenue claim, link it or it’s bs
You got calls? Still, a $5 for SNDL seems mighty aggressive
Bro, what leak. Everyone is asking for proof.

Link or ban
Nice post history, now fuck off
My post history is fine. I literally only mentioned SNDL today because of the leak. Nice try though.
Do you have a source for your claims?

Then she got up and made the mac n cheese

If this leak is available why is the stock not reacting? Link?
They haven't had earnings yet patience
I’m aware, but you’re saying all of this incredible good news plus revenue results have leaked.
Blooood red as always
Where have you been the past year?
Blood green you say?
Cum green with that shrock hanging out.
Tasty dip
You mean decade?
  No
Just had an emotional discussion with my pops about WISH. I told him to buy some when we were first hyping it up. He accidentally fat Fingered 500 shares instead of 50 in the teens. 

He has been buying the dip without telling me and had 1200 long deep in the red. I started selling his position off after that shitty earnings and he called me mad asking me why I’m doing that in his account. 

I explained to him all the reasons why WISH is a piece of shit. He is a boomer so he thinks he can just buy and hold his money back. I had to insult his intelligence in order to get him to agree to sell. 

He sounded so bummed out and defeated. He hates the stock market and never wins he says. Honestly it sucks but I kept telling him it’s going to $0 and he is a gambler. Granted I made him sell HRTZ last year at a loss and he brought that up as an argument. But WISH is the biggest piece of shit stock I have ever seen. 

I told him we are gonna move the money to PLTR and get 100k back from it. He laughed but still sounded defeated. 

There is still 700 shares left of WISH in his account. What should we do?
sounds like you’re both horrible at this
People with gambler mentality can't win in the market on short term/emotional plays. You will blow up your account over and over.

Those type of people need to just index invest and stop trying to win the lottery.

A handful of people will stumble into a 100x, but then they keep doing the same shit and lose it all.

Wish may be fair value around here, I haven't looked into it. But it's for sure a horrible company
Looks like WISH calls tomorrow then. 

And moving money TO PLTR is the dumbest fucking move. 

I have about $110k in PLTR that I’m offloading ASAP. 

Float is in the billions and insiders keep selling shares.  

Fucker is more diluted than shitty rail booze at a hick bar.
Well my dad isn’t working with that much money. And PLTR will be a phenomenal investment a few years down the line. Not looking to trade. Just looking to long term invest some money for him
Yeah this sounds like WISH is going to fly
buy $rope
Darn, that sounds rough. If he won’t let those last 700 shares go, you could sell covered calls on them to at least make some money back
Grow a set of balls and make ur money. Stop fucking with your parents money
Lol I already have a fully leveraged brokerage account of PLTR that I add to on my own. I just want my pops to experience tendies for once in his life
Clearly that hasnt been going well for you and him. You screwed up, let him decide now.
If I knew he was will to put this much in a single stock and hold it I would rather him go to literally any other stock other than WISH
You know he's a gambler though, you shouldn't be telling him anything but etfs and shit. He's old, hes gonna need that money more at that age.
His account isn’t enough money to make a difference as far as his retirement goes. He never did 401k’s or IRA’s. He paid off his house tho. That’s All he’s got going for him and his current income
Wrong cuz dey have a lot of cash
They keep burning the cash at crazy rates
Fortnite
What about Fortnite?
Meatball
what is his cost average?
About $10
[deleted]
But the shares are going to 0$
[deleted]
And if WISH is at $3 next week what then?
honestly , long term its definitely going to zero but it is a meme stock. Every now and then they will have a big pump and you can exit then. There is literally no real reason exiting right now specifically IMO. Atleast with the pump you can recover bigger chunk of losses or even breakeven depending on what happens
They are burning more and more cash every day though. And PLTR is at the bottom
it literally would matter if it was a regular company. Look at AMC and GME they burn cash every day and is not worth their value. They are only at that price because they are memestocks. I'm not saying to hold them but every so often memestocks will rally and you can dump the bags for a smaller loss then. PLTR will always have entry points , look at the charts
Hey man I agree with you it can pop. It can also fall to $3 next week and never see $5 again.
I personally think it's unlikely in this short of a time because that stock has a cult that buys the dip. Also has a lot of bag holders that think its a "squeeze". But of course I can be wrong , up to you but if your PT for PLTR is really high then why would entering now at 22 be any different than 24 if PT is like 100
Fuck man you’re making some sense over there

Any golfers here? ⛳️🏌️‍♂️ callaway is the #1 premium brand of golfing equipment eh boys. 

Top golf on top of that
I play a real mans sport, I bowl! Lol.
My set consists of a sand wedge, thrift store 3 wood, and a stolen mini golf putter. I do just fine.
>Any golfers here? ⛳️🏌️‍♂️ callaway is the #1 premium brand of golfing equipment  

Callaway is top 5. Titleist is forsure #1 followed by taylor-made.
Pshhh, Kirkland bro.
I'd argue titleist is #1 brand overall but other companies have their niches:
Driver: callaway for the epic
Wedge: Ping for glides
Irons: taylormade / titleist choose your pick
Putter: titleist (scotties) / evnroll / bettinardi
Golf bag: ping for hoofer
I mean, drivers are arguably the money makers imo. They make a nice one
Not sure if golf companies make more from drivers or iron sets. But i agree. Swung the new epic and it's straight fire.
You were told by a mod to shut the fuck up and stop shilling two times.
/u/VacationLover1 ban him for 69 hours pls
Kirkland brand golf balls all day. They hit decent and I don't get as pissed when I duff a brand new one into the water.
Really wish kirklands putters didnt have their logo plastered all over the friggen face. Would be a great putter otherwise.

Buy call leaps on Palantir. Stock has been beaten down hard past 2 days but there's a reason Mama Cathie has been buying millions of these shares in the past 2 days.

1. The infrastructure bill that was recently passed contains increased funding for CISA or CyberSecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. It also contains several provisions for increased cybersecurity investments. This bill passed Congress and will be signed into law on Monday. See here: https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/text (Do CTRL+F for "cybersecurity")

2. The 1.75 trillion dollar reconciliation bill contains several more provisions and hundreds of billion dollar investments towards cybersecurity and digital infrastructure. We could expect Palantir to win several of these contracts. 

3. Palantir is in the running for the current FDIC competition, it started with 11 vendors, but now has been selected down to 4 vendors, and Palantir is one of these 4 vendors. A contract would mean that all the banks would have to use Palantir's software. 

https://www.fdic.gov/fditech/rpp.html

Your best bet is to either buy the shares or do leap calls.

Mama Cathie is wrong. PLTR is the ultimate sideways stock
Don't be upset that she's been ditching your shitty stocks and buying Palantir. Anyone who knows about government funding sees the writing on the wall for increased revenue towards Palantir.

Almost time for my last meal of the day and I’m not even hungry. Guess drinking a gallon of water in the sauna will do that to you. 

Making my cut easier :)
Better be low carb last meal at this time
Yeah my last meal of the day is just protein and fats. Mostly pistachios
Good good, standard 40/40/20 macros?
50/30/20. I need my carbs lol
My man.  Just finished a cut and had a burger today for the first time in three months.  Glorious and yet I feel so so guilty
I’ll have my cheat meal on Saturday ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Pizza?
In N Out most likely while I’m at work doing a double lol
How much do you need to loose?
I say like 10-15 lbs. easy work.
With or without running a cycle? If without that’s gonna be a little bit of work.
With Tren of course. I’ll never do anything natty lol.  It’s all mind games anyways. Just gotta keep my cals under 2k. Hardest battle is controlling appetite
Sub 2000 sounds pretty low for someone with a ton of muscle
I am 204 lbs last check. I don’t know my body fat percentage but I clearly added fat cause I could never hold 200 before. Always settled at 190. With Tren protecting my muscle I can afford to really lower the cals and attack the fat
I need NVDA to finish above $328 tomorrow to save my calls lmao
Y does this sub buy calls on stocks that already ran a crazy amount lmao
I have a crippling addiction to losing money.
I tried buying puts on those companies that ran like crazy and here I am begging for a dip for a 50% loss
You'll be lucky if it stay above $300 tomorrow. Sell your call to save whatever you have left.

Praying SPY and GM each drop about 2.00
I'm with you for now, puts on spy for tomorrow but still have my calls for end of month
EVgo. Shoulda gone all in. May just say fuck it and do it tomorrow. Gimme one more day baby!!! Electric vehicle charging, so hot right now.
Wait for an entry point into CHPT. 

70% market share in North America and expanding into Europe. 

Plus, as a company founded in 2007, they have first mover advantage. 

Everyone else is just playing catchup.
Thanks for the tip, I did get some CHPT back when it was at about 18-19 & I’m hanging on to it for a while I think bc I absolutely agree it’s the leader but EVgo is having one hell of a week! I keep jumping in and out…working out good…so far….
Something something diamonds and chicken tenders? I’m holding my SPY puts.
something something man-ipulation something reeeee.
Buy more BABA
Cant wait to follow along and see PSFE gang dead in a few days 🤡
Paysafe 5-10% dead cat bounce?
how did it drop so much on what appeared to be a profitable ER?

that kind of drop is reserved for declaring bk in the earnings call
Wasn't it a terrible ER with decreased guidance and huge misses?
I like Quanta Services (PWR) because if everything goes EV, someone is going to have to build out all this electric grid infrastructure, and they are the biggest
So leap on PWR?
I'm playing it with shares, but leaps could be good too.  I think it's a longer play.
Yeah like 10 years plus
Spy red at open 462 then end of day it hits 465

People used to think Matthew McConaughey was on the same level of attractiveness as Brad Pitt lol has any heartthrob ever fallen off so hard
Bruce Jenner fell off harder
Bruh, Brad Pitt is doing commercials for Delonghi Coffee machines these days
You would too if they paid you 50k for 2 days of work.
I bet he made much more than that on the gig
Better than doing 120,000 lincoln commercials
Dude is though, better actor too
I am a fan of both but Pitt is the better actor

To suggest McConaughey is as good looking as Pitt currently is silly
I think it's pretty close, have you seen true crime season 1? Better than anything Pitts ever done
> I don't watch TV.
True Detective S1 was good. Idk if I'd say it's better than anything Pitt has done though. Especially hard to compare since Pitt doesn't have any real flagship series roles, but imo Pitt's roles in snatch, basterds, fight club, se7en, burn after reading, once upon a time... all are at least up to par or close with McConaughey in true detective plus with more interesting range

Also it gets you closer to some of that hot southern Christian girl ass.
And calls would be dead on Friday.
Yeah I’ll believe in Jesus when he brings my expired otm options back to life 3 days later
Meh. Strange cultural reference. I wonder what financial advices would give Scooby Doo.
How sick would it be to know how to use a sword like a samurai/nerd. Imagine someone tried to rob you and you whoop out a katana. Slice a mfs hands clean off like Danzel Washington in the Book of Eli
They shoot you with their gun lol tf
They tried that in book of Eli. He still won.
That movie sucked though
Doesn’t change the fact that he chopped em up
Yeah but was also blind too, so... It obviously only works if you're blind, otherwise you just get shot
He was blind and like Jesus 2.0 or something, so just learn how to become a prophet too.

Bagholders will tell you the next big date to wait for.
Citadel investor withdrawal deadline, Cohen gag order ends, pending Loopring partnership announcement, black Friday and holiday season plus a shit ton of Blockbuster games coming out and everyone wants the new consoles and GME gets a cut of every digital sale on the Microsoft store on Xbox sold there and oh ya, GME is about to revolutionize the way securities, art, and collectibles are traded so idk just a few things
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)

Idk wtf that is but I’m buying some at market open because a guy on reddit said it
I mean they’re cheap nothing wrong with buying just a few and forgetting about until then 


I lose thousands a day. What’s a thousand or whatever in long calls that I won’t even consider touching for 6 months finna do? Worst case scenario oh nooo another thousand lost. But bigly upside potential
Go a little further out and you could pay long term capital gains instead of short term

Punish the legacy automakers… 100 year old plants, unions, ICE legacy costs and supply base cock block to EV’s…
Ugh “punish” Jesus fuck

Go 

Just go away and never come back
Sorry you must have been a GM EV1 engineer from 1996 to 1999 before they killed the project and scraped every car.

The fact we had to invade Iraq for oil should give you a god damn idea how tied we are to Saudi oil stability.  You know, the « kill the journalists in an embassy in Turkey because they will buy weapons from the US so it’s OK » kind of deal.

Screw off.
You don't know what you're doing.
oK I DoNt KnOW
Ok, fine. Invest with your dick instead of your head. Stick your dick in a hornets nest because you think it's right, even though you just stated that we rely on Saudi oil in the same breath as we need to kill legacy automakers. They've felt the pressure. Change is coming. An oligopoly isn't giving up their influence that easily. TSLA caught these fuckers with their pants down. They got bandaids on their buttholes now.
So.. you the Saudi lobby?
BTW if EV’s come on line fast enough our worry won’t be Saudi’s but China for rare earth and lithium.  Oil consumption will plummet.
Happily we have plenty in N.A. and can watch the Saudi’s implode from a distance.
While we keep pumping American and Canadian oil out of the ground to refine right here in Texas or Louisiana.  

So yeah, suck it.
How did you get Saudi lobby from that? I said legacy automakers are going to EVs you fuckstick. I was pointing out the inconsistency in your reasoning.
> I'm not going to argue with a stupid ape.
You’re so upset over a few downvotes

Unstable
Ok so the foundries owned by the automakers, the piston, pump, fuel delivery system, oil lubrication, cooling, supply base which was basically « no longer needed » could be flushed, and and entirely new electrical supply chain that had zero presence in the market before would have just been « turned on » by GM, Ford, Mercedes, BMW, Toyota?

You do know each of those companies has a ICE performance shop but nearly ZERO EV performance shop?

The market decides.  Make a cool product, people buy it.  Tesla = Elon had balls.
This is copy pasta worthy lmao
Everything gotta be political since the apes came
It’s not political. 

Legacy car makers: legacy ICE engineering, manufacturing and supply base sunk costs, including all the EPA lobbying costs for CAFE standards.

They don’t want EV’s.  GM killed their own baby from 1996-1999 with the EV1 project.
But built it like a Honda Accent had a deformed baby.  They HAVE NO INCENTIVE to change.

Ooops Tesla, Lucid and now Rivian are pure EV plays and the market is massively investing because the dinosaurs didn’t lead, they avoided changing.  And now we can have S.3.X.Y. Cars with all kinds of cool features and styling from start up’s which will work at start up speeds.

Bullish on EV’s.  Why the hell would Ford invest 12% in Rivian and GM womansplain how they are UnDeRVaLuEd?
I think market is pricing in trump presidency in 2024, that's how you make 🚀

“Supply chain issues” means American fatties are flush with cash and need more crap to buy but there aren’t enough workers to make it/deliver it.

Inflation is a problem because it will raise real wages. 

If this keeps up, they will open the boarders so that biggies in Laredo can have their Russell sweat pants and easy bake ovens 

We don’t even need puts. What’s the point? The world makes, we take, that’s the game, it’s not changing anytime soon
It means the opposite. How many companies have been unable to source materials for their baseline demand? Input costs are higher because of the supply chain issues, which leads to price gouging to lower quantity demanded. People aren't flush with cash right now, banks are. You think buying treasury bonds goes to your average schmuck? This has nothing to do with the fed and everything to do with the ships unable to unload their shit. Fucking workers have been striking. How far up your own ass are you?
You’re just not willing to listen to the core of the issue. This isn’t the same inflationary issue from the 70’s. This is because we are spending money on just crap, rather than services. Unemployment is still high. People are still buying houses: Christmas is still going to happen. 

Workers strike because the jobs suck and they don’t pay. They demand higher wages and should get them. That’s where this “inflation crisis” narrative is stemming from. Our economy is predicated on people doing trash jobs for little pay: when that isn’t happening, things fall apart
So, if people working in the logistics chain are striking, it's demand driven? If China stops exporting cheap steel, still demand driven? If house prices are driven up by large corporations buying inventory and they can't turn a profit, that's demand driven? Homebuilders not being able to afford lumber, concrete and steel to turn a profit because of shortages DIRECTLY caused by covid closures of mills? Those are demand driven? This is a ripple effect. It hasn't been long enough for JIT supply to catch up and NOW people are doing sick outs and protests due to mandates and pay. Most of that extra money is gone and most benefits have run out. How is everyone sitting on a pile of cash to drive demand? This is cost-push inflation because of the backlog.
A class/caste of people in the US, are fine right now. I mean, this sub has 11+ million turkeys throwing pennies in the wishing well right now with money they ordinarily would be putting to needs, like cheap liquor, skunk weed, and Walmart discounts. 

I’m arguing the cause of the craze. Demand of labor is really high right now. Workers strike because in this homebound economy, many businesses saw record profits, but it’s not translating into wages. 

Home buying has not stopped. Home prices are not inflated because of lack of stock. Home prices should drop if large corporations were buying them and can’t sell them, what sense does that make? Gas prices rise because less people drive. 

COVID caused many people to loose their jobs, mostly cause of firing and then caused others to quit/retire for various reasons. Real wages for wait staff has climbs drastically. The rest of these businesses do not want this to happen. Walmart’s entire model is predicted in keeping shelves stocked with things people need and paying the absolute minimum for wages. Let those employees unionize/demand higher pay and we will either see legislation suppressing unions, or many large corporations fall
It was only a few months ago that shelves were empty in some stores. Not everything has caught up. There's a lot of people here throwing away money they don't have. I was referring to Zillow not being able to move their inventory and losing money, which only just got reported (I expect more soon). Home buying demand is still high. That's probably a result of the near zero rates, so I yield to that point that it's demand driven inflation for real estate. I maintain that the cost of materials is mainly a supply chain issue, though, which is causing people to bid higher than they normally would on existing homes.
Zillow can’t sell them, yet people are outbidding one another on existing spaces? This does not jive at all. Zillow’s issue was that they let an algorithm determine the price. There are so many spaces open for leasing in my city, but the owners are just keeping the price inflated wishing that the demand returns. 

What I’m saying is this is an issue with the supply chain, but not how it’s being parroted. It’s systemic, for sure, but more in the frame of greed/wealth than an issue with the valuation of our currency. People either died, or choose not to work. This disrupts the chain. On the other end you have employers/owners, choosing not to raise wages or lower prices, for their own reasons. Sometimes it’s because materials costs are high, sometimes distribution chains are broken, but those materials are in turn inflated for the original causes. There isn’t less milk. There are less people willing to be apart of process of getting it from the cow to the store for a little more than that guy was paid in the bottom of the oil tanker in waterworld. 

This ain’t Jimmy Carter’s “you need to eat less to stretch your dollar”. This is “we need you to keep buying Bs, but we don’t want to have to pay your more or keep giving you UBI (child tax credits)… so let’s call it inflation and try to enact policy to get things back to where they were with you sucking balls for .50 rather than you saying ‘I don’t like sucking balls for .50, so I’ll sit here on my ass for .35”
What do you want, price ceilings? That worked so well in the 70s. Even if you're correct, that's still cost-push inflation. There's nothing to be done but wait it out. Unless temporary restrictions have gone on too long and someone is fucking up a major port's ability to unload product causing a gigantic fucking bottleneck. You know... normal shit that's totally not a logistics nightmare.
Good job on pumping futures up . Let’s get it over triple digits and keep it there till am

I got that like 3 years ago. I feed off it.

Fucking gains, fuck those, I can’t gain in the mirror. Feelsbadman. Forever small.

Yup. Your losses will kick you in your nuts, every time. Your wins, no matter how massive, will never register a week after you made them. That's cause humans see gains as external to them, something that happens TO them. Losses are seen as weaknesses, something that a person CAUSED themselves to experience.

You won't last long in this biz if you allow the pain from each draw down in your account to hurt you like this. The market is a river. It will go wherever it wants, and you are merely a tiny leaf floating on its surface.

If you have a strategy, and you follow that strategy, and you are confident in that strategy, then that's all you can do. And what happens, happens
If you think 33K is a lot of money you don't know true autism
You have yet to fall under your initial principal..... what are you even getting stressed about? Your life in literally no different now than it was when you started ~~investing~~ gambling. If that money is in your brokerage account and not your checking its not even real money yet.   


Lowkey think this is an attempt at a humble brag? You list one drawdown.... against 2 surges. How does that hurt? Did you expect to go up forever without any setbacks at all?
ZM looking so cheap to me. Maybe I buys one leap
When it comes to hookup culture, do you think it benefits men, women, both, or neither?
Attractive people.
Actually I would say it benefits ugly people hooking up with other ugly people……. Beautiful people are usually quite choosy as they can have anyone…. I know, because I’m beautiful
Benefits stocks for Plan B…..if that’s a thing idk
Women, if they want it. Otherwise, nobody
Neither. You pay with your soul

FUBO puts
It’s almost like MMs sold their TSLA on Monday, so they could sit and buy up shares at a new bottom they control as Musk sells.
lol no. he didnt sell all. and if he did youd have common sense and look at the daily volume compared to what he was suppose to sell. newbie. triple digits tomorrow. hope you arent bag holding but i can sniff it
He's selling 2.5b out of 20b every day. Hes gonna be selling til mid next week or so.
the DOW is pretty useful in predicting SPY's short term movement
Especially the weekend DOW
Guys i bought BLNK puts.. shoulda told yall so everyone could fade me.

Same. Didn't think a 2 billion dollar company with losses 3x their revenue would hold. But then I remember we are in the hyperinflated speculative market thanks to the FED. God help the country next crash.

Anyone watching DASH? About to pop the resistance at all time highs
There's no organic interest in DoorDash.  It's all just algos trading with each other for a piece of trash company that keeps losing more and more money.
Yep. I cannot fathom it is around in 5 years.
They're already at the point where they are diluting and paying obscene amounts to acquire other companies just to show revenue growth.  

They are already losing a ton of money themselves, and now they are paying at least 5x more than they should for another company that loses even more money.  They are going to be diluting to the tune of over 8 billion dollars to capture a few hundred million in revenue and negative earnings.  Just wild.  DoorDash is a posterchild for the current bubble economy.
Lol ok
I traded it today for 100% and yesterday for 200%. Watching it again tomorrow

Lose that $200

With that little bit of money, just buy NVDA, AMD, COST, or MSFT shares.

Once you got some gains learn about options spreads, I recommend call debit spreads for beginners. Once you get a better understanding of options the rest is up to you.

Just be careful, a lot of us here treat stocks like a casino. Thus don’t go full WSB right off the bat, especially if you’re not ready to go high risk/high gains.
how this guy gonna buy shares when he can't even afford a share LMAO
You do know fraction shares are a thing, right? lol

Also they can technically buy one share of $AMD at the moment. 

Either way fraction shares are better than nothing, since with their amount they can barely afford calls for some big boy bullish stocks if any.

It's wsb. Lol.

I have calls from last week too.

Not with my hand 😎

Oh yeah!
This sub is autist thinking inflation isn’t priced in. You really think spy gives a shit?

Go buy puts at open, I dare you
Rising rates will fuck everything, that's not priced in.
I bought puts yesterday. It's not going great..
My point
How them calls doin?
Bruh i bought puts last week on the jobs report day that pumped spy to 470, same time you're telling everyone spy 500 eow. We inverse you
First!!
Have a feeling NVDA ready to crash for earnings
Didnt NVDA moon after last ER?
That’s why. Everyone expecting it to moon like they were for COIN and see what it did
COIN missed on revenue … NVDA is not missing
It went go from $200 to $300 in like 3 weeks.
I have a feeling of the opposite
You guys are way too confident right now. Wait till the bond market opens.
And then what?  My worthless SPY calls will turn negative?
I can’t be the only one that thinks using the Clown emoji makes you look illiterate

WSB has always been compromised but especially so since January.
You said GME was running to 350 this week. And AMD to 170.

Maybe you're just really fucking stupid?
> I am.
Good news /u/Renegade2592, VisualMod diagnosed you fucktard
Oh look the biggest shill of em all
I own 400 shares of GME. I sell calls on it hoping to get assigned. I do get assigned from time to time.

And somehow, I'm always able to buy the shares back for a reasonable price. Maybe it's because it's not worth much over $200.
Seriously man, is this performance art? Are you one of ZJZ's bots trying to build an Ape personality from the ground up with your inane bullshit?

Fuck man, get out of here. Ban.
Some people aren’t worth acknowledging
I will continue to abuse him until he has stopped shitting up this board.
Jokes on you, I like it
Make an aggressive GME banbet that expires on a Monday. Use the correct format. I sent you the correct format awhile ago.
I already have a banbet going 300 60d.. I'll make it 1000 by March when it allows me to roll out
Good. Expires on a Monday too which means the full week will be without you. If only it were sooner.
Ima win that shit just like I won the last one

I all ind gme calls the night before she had a 20% move. You watch the ticker last Wednesday?

Explain that price action, rip to 250 than immediately goes back to red. You know there is a massive amount of fraud waiting to be uncovered once we close above 300 again.

Shorts will be exposed
> Shorts will be exposed

When?

If it goes to 300 are you validated?

The answer is no, because you regards believe in 100k per share or something.

If it makes another run, it will probably peter out around 250 or lower, because the range on these run ups is getting smaller.


The IV will remain perpetually high. I will farm a couple thousand dollars a week from idiots like you hoping to make a fortune. Or in your case, make back the fortune you already fucking lost lmao
So... puts?

Tom Lee says the rally is intact but if you look at the chart SPY still hasn't gotten back to the 50DMA. Not that there's any meaning in that. Unless there is.

u/danferindustries You good bro? Check futs, may buy you Wendy’s tomorrow if you’re lucky

I didn't do all the technical drawings and triangles and logarithms and whatnot, but it might hit 470 again by eoy. It might hit 440 too. Both, probably. In the same day would be amazing.

I recall you saying that a full week seemed harsh and you'd set it to 5 days, or unban on weekends or something.

Sell your calls and just put it in spy. You will make more money that way. Or at least sell them and buy itm options. I’ve read a dozen people warn you, take the advice
Not as fun. I’d rather buy deep OTM long calls and if SPY dips just buy more contracts and hold.
It’s an addiction man, you said it yourself. Everyone keeps warning you and downvoting you and you keep at it. You need a 5% gain to BREAKEVEN on your calls that expire on the 19th. Not make money, just fucking breakeven. Is a 5% gain realistic in 5 trading days? Again, just to breakeven
Who cares about the 19th it’s only $100, I got 500/530C to hedge. If they hit great if they don’t I could care less.
I wish you luck
Yeah futures looking great
Don't worry about rsi with spy worry about memory. Look at the past patterns. Spy follows a pattern almost like clockwork, unless the market as a whole is making an unpredictable move.

Seriously bros. Having abs is easy mode with girls. Desperate to gain my cheat code back lol

Why do you think women allow me all my fantasies? It’s cause of the abs dum dum. Gives you special privileges with them

Best actors

1a. Daniel Day-Lewis 

1b. Nicolas Cage 

2a. Christian Bale

2b. Brad Pitt 

3) Jake Gyllenhaal 

4) Leonardo DiCaprio

5) Johnny Depp
The only correct answer is Eddie Murphy in the nutty professor.
Was there more than one nutty professor or was there just The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps? I only had the second one but I'm also not aware of whether or not the first one existed
The first one had the iconic “her-cu-lees” scene.
I thought that was 2
Eddie Murphy is a fucking genius. His appearance on Carson amazes me. He’s only like 21 years old then but is composed and relaxed as if he’s a seasoned comedian
Nicolas Cage 😂
He is arguably the best of the generation think about it
The bees 🐝
[you may be on to something](https://youtu.be/vbLgngQVSsU)
I don’t think Nic Cage and Brad Pitt belong up there. That is some crazy other worldly levels of acting.
Brando, Chaplin, Newman, De Niro, Fonda didn’t make the cut huh.
Jack Nicholson? Bruh
Yeah he's great but he's about a generation ago plus his style is pretty specific. I wouldn't hate having him included on this list though I'd probably stick him in the 3 spot
Very true about the specific style part, I'd change some parts but still a decent list tho
Michael Keaton would like a word.
I like michael keaton but I wouldn't consider him better than any of these listed
Nicolas Cage and Johnny Depp not quite what they used to be…
Ben Affleck? Denzel Washington? Idris Elba? Chris Hemsworth? Josh Brolin? Benicio Del Toro?
Ben Affleck is good but these are all better.

Denzel is great but doesn't really have the range imo

Idris Elba is one of the most overrated actors imo but he brings a pretty much unmatched sense of cool which makes him seem more impressive than his skills are

I like Chris Hemsworth but no

Same with Josh Brolin

Benicio Del Toro could have some consideration
I've never seen a Daniel Day-Lewis movie, any suggestions?
All of them he has never played a bad role

Gangs of New York and There Will Be Blood
LOOK AT ME /u/AmericanHerstoryX. YOU'RE LOWER THAN A BASTARD. YOU HAVE NONE OF ME IN YOU. YOU'RE JUST A BASTARD FROM A BASKET.
I want to say your wrong, but it’s a pretty solid list. 1 and 2 seem in order
missing Joaquin Phoenix ,Michael J Fox, and Jeff Bridges
I go back and forth on Joaquin but I did consider including him because he scratches a similar itch as Cage for me. Michael J Fox no, Jeff Bridges yeah deserves the recognition
I actually wrote a unpopular opinion on how trash johnny depp movies are..dude has like 3 good movies out of 100...oh and Tom hanks is top 5
I'm not talking about movie quality I'm talking about acting chops
Jamie Fox should be up there too.
He's one of the best entertainers and maybe one of the best comedic actors but I wouldn't put him on a best actors list
I dont see why not! He has an academy award (best actor) for his portrayal of Ray Charles in 2005. I put him 1b.
You'd seriously put him about Bale, Pitt, Gyllenhaal, and DiCaprio? Foolish

I could see why you might want to put him ahead of Depp but imo you'd be wrong. Though I could be swayed there since I think a lot of my perception of Depp as a great actor may just come from his weirdo hipsterness rather than skill. But there are still names ahead of Foxx I'd put there I think
I'm paper handing everything the first sign of green

When is infra bill signing
Today i think
Or monday I've heard
Shit. I have 39 call for today. It hit after hours yesterday but looks kinda weak now. Without deal it can be bad today.
Totally could be wrong, just saw another comment on here lol, u should def google it. But dam dude u r balls deep.

 What's calls u got? 

I got TSLA calls in hoping too, but idk if ev is included in the bill.
i brought it yesterday for 67 bucks. 39 strike. Blink call. expiring today. mine sixth option ever brought. first ever hit a target ( AH) sadly could not sold in afterhours.
Oh damn dude hopefully it pumps asf and theta won't eat them up too fast. I would sell for a profit in the morning. But best of luck dude!!!!!!
I already put it on sell order. as soon the market opens I gonna sell it. Blink had good earnings so hoping for a bit of pump f the market wont die today.

>In fact, the Federal Reserve was helpless only because it wanted to be. Clearly the Federal Reserve was less interested in checking speculation than in detaching itself from responsibility from the speculation that was going on. And it will be observed that some anonymous draftsman achieved a wording that indicated that not the present level but only a further growth in speculation would be viewed with alarm. Never before or since have so many become so wondrously, so effortlessly, and so quickly rich. Perhaps Messrs. Hoover and Mellon, and the Federal Reserve were right in keeping their hands off. Perhaps it was worth being poor for a long time to be so rich for just a little while.

Sex Ed on Netflix is funny as fuck
Seen it its great... I want those two main characters ..skinny kid and Maeve to get together
Cowboy Bebop is on Netflix now.
is it any good? heard of it but never watched. I like anime like demon slayer, jujutsu Kaisen etc..
I really enjoy it. It is kind of a mix between noir and cyberpunk with a killer soundtrack.
ok will watch ty :)
> I like anime. I like watching Attack on Titan and the new season of Sword Art Online.
parasyte
rate out of 10? I've seen the trailer
wouldn't call it anime, but Castlevania was pretty good imo on Netflix. also there's a new season of Bobs Burgers I believe. in terms of anime, it's fairly old but Hajime no Ippo is good.
Seen Castlevania.,it was forsure different. ty I will check those out
I liked Neon Genesis Evangelion and Fairy Tail  (there’s like 500 episodes of that!)
ok thank you I will check them out and hopefully they catch my attention fast. If a show is slow at the start I have a hard time binging it
NGE is batshit crazy - but it’s got mechs and monsters so what’s not to like. Fairy Tail is probably my favorite anime - so much fun - Enjoy!

Mancin out here trying to take my tax credits.
He's not trying to take away the tax credits for EV's. He is making sure that the credits are equally available to all EV;s manufactured in the US. Biden wants larger credit to go to union made vehicles which would mostly benefit Ford and GM. While other EV's made in the us with non union employess would get a lower tax credit, this would include Tesla because Tesla is non union. It seems to me that to unfairly support union over non union should be rejected. If the vehicle is made in America, it should be eligible for the full tax credit.
Shills out in force tonight
No way he lets that fly considering non-union Toyota is spending a lot of money on manufacturing facilities in West Virginia. 

Either all EVs get it, or none...and it's way more likely none because the CBO is gonna give the legislation an awful score and the bill will never get passed.

He isn't. People like you just mention him.
Ocugen Phase 3 study on Covid was just published in the Lancet. I get “sell the news” but if that gets emergency use clearance in Canada that they are looking at now…oh my.
there are covid therapeutics now for everyone who doesnt want the vaxxx. only a year too late. shame.
Large difference between a vaccine and a therapeutic administered during illness. This is also highly effective against the delta variant. Do you think Covid is over already?
i think the market is saturated with experimental vaccines. anyone who wants one can get one. anyone who doesnt isnt going to take one from some no-name company.
I’m playing the long game here. With a successful phase 3, working towards clearance in Canada and US and highly effective against the delta variant, think we could see some success long term. I get the flu vaccine each year and don’t have a clue who the supplier is.

Do it right or don't do it at all
RIVN > TSLA!

Release the options!
Dog all the value has been squeezed out and sold off to retail… Im stoked to have an all American EV manufacturer public, but I worry about the value. Lucid seems to have much more room to run in the short term.
Yes, but Rivian is a catalyst to people throwing money at pure EV car makers so we are punishing the legacy car makers for ducking around so long on keeping ICE engines around.

I bought Rivian at $111, and am fine with it to hold.
I bought LCID late at $24 but happy I did, and bought some TSLA today at 1068.  The boat will float for all of them as GM tries to say « wE aRe UnDeRVaLuEd »
I think RIVN is much better than Lucid. You can almost buy 2 R1T for the price of a Lucid car. I also think their niche is they are producing trucks and SUVs not cars. They also seems to allow people to really deck these vehicles out for whatever they want/need. Also they have amazing range. I could go on.

Aside from the company’s product though they will have growing pains, and a lot of them. They are expensive, but I’m sure backing from Amazon, Ford and T. Row drove the price even higher. Right now they’re  not profitable, but I think they will be. Furthermore at this price and volatility I think it will pull people away from TSLA because they can afford way more stock/options than TSLA. 
(Hopefully RJ will not be on Twitter at 12 AM on Saturday nights)
I get it.. it is cool to hate on $WISH

Just like Champions used to be a “Walmart brand”

GME had historic short interest and fell from 500 to 40, a 90% drop.

DWAC is down much less from its peak and is a fraud company.

Am I crazy for looking to lower my average cost of $BFLY, doubling my holdings? I've had it since before the SPAC merger and it's been awful haha, my losses with 33 shares are currently at 45%. I think the long term picture hasn't changed though and today $BFLY hit an all-time low, I think it's noted at a heavy discount already so surely it can't get much lower than this. Their earnings are next monday, expecting it to pop then because current price is ridiculous IMO. Remember that this is the company backed by mr. and miss. Gates before they divorced and also Cathy Wood. What do you guys think?

EDIT: now that I think about it, almost every growth stock has been getting fucked by earnings so will definitely wait for that.

Depends. What data are you looking for.
Not sure on the specifics, but overall make trades according to algorithms I create, [this seems to be a good starting point ](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/apis)
Have a quick glance but if it’s available via the TD API I’m sure it has most everything you’d need. Whatever you can’t find via a public API you might have to scrape.
TDA has a good API

I followed Kevin O Leary's advice and diversified today. 8 out of the 10 stocks I bought are in the red.
When buying options I look at the only thing that matters, the theoretical max profit. So far, I’m bankrupt.
Today, I became an investor
Nobody cares about 6% inflation, tomorrow will be green as fuck

Thanksgiving. Shelves are empty, no turkeys or gravy in stock. Gas price $8/gal. Massive riot and looting. 

Market ATHs.
Got laid off today, downsizing, RIP in peace ☠️🪦
WSB is an interesting display of our current economic inequality, scrolling through people shrugging off 100k losses and seeing someone whose rent relies on their 12 shares of PLTR increasing tomorrow. Godspeed to all retards.
The good news about inflation is that the money I'm losing now isn't worth that much anymore. Take that, feds

Cnbc girls need a bikini calendar. It would sell out in hours. 😍
Is valuation meaningless?     Rivian,  made 0 revenue at the moment, has a 87B market cap .
I swear this place is getting so weird. Boomers pumping dumbass dividend stocks, i swear Ford employees are trying to pump and dump F, bears keep writing these dumb ass essays about some obscure metric nobody cares about that signals the great Yahweh crash of 1918. Man bring back the people who were just trying to make some money cuz they were just kinda poor ass kids trying to hustle up instead of this boomer burry bullshit. Yeah dude if hyperinflation happens your puts arent gonna be worth shit cuz we are all gonna be scavenging the wasteland for berries.
God I wish PornHub would do an IPO, shit would be the biggest meme stock in history
I can see the headlines now:

**Elon announces his 10% sale is completed. Elon also declares a 1:10 split**
why do I not just take my gains? am I retarded?
#Pro tip


Buy stock first, research later what they do when it's down 50%.
Elon going to sell stock! 📉

Elon sold stock! 📈

Empires last about 250 years. They go through six stages: Pioneers, Conquest, Commerce, Affluence, Intellectual achievement, Decadence.

And Decadence is marked by ─

- Debasement of currency
- Economic crises
- Public shows to distract the populace
- Chefs as celebrities, emphasis on food pleasure (part of a vain search to recapture the old feeling of national greatness)
- Apathy
- Sexual obsession

Snake person is back, good signs for the market tomorrow
Futures are up bigly. Japan is up. China is up a ton. We're going up today. Bears are screwed.
Bears win again.

Yearly score board now stands at

the year is 3024, PLTR was just upgraded from a price target of 23 to 24
TSLA 1070c/1080c

TSLA 1050p/1030p

NVDA 295c/305c

I have no clue what im doing here and it shows.
I held my $SOFI calls, which were down 42%, through today. Thank Jesus!!! What a beat!!
Long term investors are just lazy traders
Government ruins everything.
made $15k off TSLA calls last week, then proceeded to lose $10k from SPY, NVDA, FB this week. I am a true retard
I knew SOFI wouldn’t let me down 🥲
**My life changed forever when I tried the goldfish cheddar blast instead of the regular ones I always get😳 MAN THAT SHIT IS GOOD!**

The universe is 13.8 billion years old. The average person in Rwanda earns $2.1 per day (8.7 cents per hour). US national debt is 29 trillion.

If 1 thousand Rwandans were working 24/7 without a break since the big bang they would be able to repay the US national debt of 29 trillion today.
Puts on my weed stash. Shit has been getting burned all day
Im down 99% and have $200 left. I keep depositing my checks, make like 300%, then lose it all over and over again. Been doing this for a while now. Probably lost 70k trying to chase the elusive 10 bagger. I wonder if I'll ever stop.

Atleast I don't pay the IRS shit.
Like the mighty Necromancer, I will raise my portfolio from the dead
I was just over in r/conspiracy and man there’s more retards there than there is here
The stark difference between Bear & Bull is ingenuity.

A Bull can see something, potential, an idea, or a vision.

I think Bears must have a chemical imbalance or maybe fetal alcohol syndrome, but all you guys see is lines on charts, or numbers. Sounds fucking weird.
long dated calls on the way down

short dated calls on the way up

that's the way I like to fuck
Losing 20k today didn’t hurt so bad because my soon to be ex-wife is expecting half my shit. Why can’t that bitch get her own money

I sold on the 4th because I was afraid of earnings. Considering jumping back in now
Sofi is still down on the week. We need a solid 20% open

Incredible bull market this year and I’m down 50%. Even worse I’m down like 80% from my peak. I’ve been way too short term focused.

some of these amc youtubers havent thought this through. they just hyped a bunch of crazy people into losing tons of money. do they really think "im not a financial advisor" is going to work when someone breaks into their house with a knife? hope the tshirt sales were worth it.
I bought META calls so I'm a value investor
WISH has always been garbage
Who bought those SOFI puts? 😂
Were TSLA 11/19 1200c a good idea today?

Read on here the other night about a guy overhearing his neighbor on his porch complaining to his therapist that the market was giving him anxiety.

Wtf, WISH is not supposed to be up.
Mouse is cooked
Weeklies are for the young, I cant keep doing this, im only 29 😔
Too bad sofi rip on earnings equals even for the day LOL
HOLY FICK MY FORD CALLA
Sofi to the moonnnnnnnn
Alot of you were WISH bagholders, call holders, etc.

You boys held in. Good job. Hope the best for you. May it moon and may you be able to snort a LOT of coke.
DIS puts
AFRM calls
SOFI calls

Right now if it holds I just finally hit the jackpot. Thank you guys!
$SOFI always moons after I buy. I guess even a broken clock is right twice a day.
Buy SOFI calls it drains all the way till earnings
Decide to buy SOFI puts instead it moons AH

I’m cursed, I literally cannot win at this
I lost $12,000 today.

But my calls aren't expiring till the end of the year so we good!!
Dear SoFi,


Please bail out my weeklies.


Signed,

the WISH after hours pop isn't even enough to make up for how much it dipped today 😐

That’s it DIS, go back to dying more 😌 kill that overinflated rat back to its real value
SoFi earnings call in 2 min. Come listen to your soon-to-be Dad, Anthony Noto.
Can Sofi just announce the bank charter so my wounds can heal?
Bought a few $22 SOFI calls for Friday right before close.  My only regret was not buying more
You know it was someone here who bought WISH for 5.84 AH
FUCK YOU PALANTIR, AND FUCK YOU WHALE
LOL @ the WISH bagholders. Where did they go?
What’s the need for affirm when you could use a credit card ? Tf ?
HOOD's IPO was nothing more than an exit scam for institutions.

My Portfolio is trying to help me out with no nut November.
I played AFRM earnings like this:  
\+3 11/12 130p  
\-5 11/12 128p  
\+2 11/19 125p  


This spread is profitable in a price range of roughly 100 to 155 on 11/12.  


AFRM would have to completely blow up to its ATH value to cause a significant loss.  


Like, it would have to go all the way back up to 170.  


Couldn't happen.

If the ppi is 8.6% and the cpi is at 6.2% and CPU typically lags ppi and both are going up, would it be unreasonable to expect 10% cpi inflation by the beginning of the new year? How the Fuck is this acceptable and how bad is this gonna get?
No one cares our lives are transitory
Transitory or finite?
Transifinite
Inflation is nothing to worry about. Soon you’ll own nothing and be happy. Inflation cannot harm you if you have nothing and being freed from that monster will make you so happy. Trust us. -the (un)FED probably
We have been passing on 24% increases and Car / Ag vehicle makers aren’t even blinking … they want to sell parts

I think the answer is "bad enough" for the Fed to be forced to tighten
LOL, Cathie bought 1.2 million shares of PLTR today. This after yesterday, she bought 1.3 million shares

Pro tip to look cool in front of family or friends:

Before going on a road trip, study the route before hand. Then when you get in the car turn the gps onto a foreign language. Your friends will think your actually understanding it and believe your cultured
Pro tip- look up the main route ahead of time, select the longer dumbass route first and then say “I have a shortcut” while proceeding to go the main way
Ah yes, deception, the basis for any good relationship

You must be ugly, the apps work fine for me

Best post ever. Imagine if women had to go buy themselves a drink at a bar to try to meet a guy?!  Like, they had to take $20 with them to buy themselves a couple beers. Mind blown.

Let the TSLA Bubble resume 10 T market cap here we come.
I threw my last 6% of my 15k in PLTR puts before earnings. I’m now up 390% in 2 days and only down 72% on the year. I’m a retard and holding still. I want closer to even or I mean I’m already used to cold Wendy’s so
please take profits
I will… AS SOON as I lose 60% of my gains bro, you know the drill
please bro listen to me

YOU WILL REGRET NOT SELLING
Sounds like a retard I know
Don't do this to yourself.
congrats i guess lol
cold Wendy's: givin BJs behind the dumpster Nov - Mar.
hot Wendy's: you guessed it.
To be fair to Elon, CEOs sell their shares all the time lol.

They just don't do a Twitter poll about it.
He did the poll because he didn’t want to pull out and have everyone freak out more. There is an Article that explains that how Elon is in the long run saving billions for selling rather than later and is fucking the SEC. Can google it. It was a nice way to keep the Tesla apes strong although he had to have his stock options liquidated before they turned worthless.
https://www.barrons.com/articles/elon-musk-sold-tesla-stock-it-wasnt-because-of-taxes-51636593001?siteid=yhoof2

PLTR will forever be a 22 meme but seeing it’s back at 22, looks like it’s time to buy again

Too many bears. My puts are fucked.
I think chipotle gave me the herpes

One time, I ordered some earrings from WISH as a gift. Three months later, I received a mangled box containing twine tied to rusty fishhooks. Can’t understand why their stock isn’t mooning.

Guys, update on the research. 

I found out a Toyota Prius is the cheapest vehicle to live in because it already has an HVAC system. You can buy a used 2005 one for like 3k and fold the back seats down and that's good enough as a bed. There's also a portable potty thing that fits in the space behind the driver seat so you have a bathroom and bedroom for like a total of $3050. Many people just use water bottles and wipes for their showering  and kitchen water needs.

I'll keep researching and update you guys with anymore useful information I find.
When living out of a car, one of the best suggestions I’ve ever seen is getting a gym membership for showering needs
3.05 k you got anything in the 0.02k bracket? I’m pretty sure I can’t get financing.

Imagine being one of those people that has to relate politics to every aspect of their life, personality, and conversations. What a shit life
There's more of us normal folks than you know. The crazies are just the loudest.
People that get really worked up about politics are like little kids at Chucky Cheese getting all excited about winning plastic prizes worth 1 cent which they forget about a day later.
it blows my mind that people spend their lives supporting one of the two parties. people who rave about kpop also blow my mind, but thats a different issue i suppose.
It blows my mind that people devote so much time of their lives to something that they will have very little effect on
"Gas Prices are going up, since Biden is personally not working on oil rigs"
See, you think you're agreeing with me, but you're proving my point
Yes, and yes. 

I follow the oil market and some boomer at the gym parroted that BS to me.

The fundamentals of oil glossed over his smooth brain.
Fair enough
You’re only saying that because you voted for (some 70 year old dude who never worked for a living).

You sound like you have a shit life
pretty good actually
I have puts in every earning. One has to be a winner.
BYND to drill please. I'm 0/5 for earnings the last few weeks
Just noticed I'm down 17k this week. Probably not going to mention that to my wife.
I AM the wife that’s down 8k…….
You should tell you husband. Honesty and openness are important in a healthy relationship.
I will when you will🤣
I'll let her know.
It can be our litte secret. Remember the bro code.
Enough brahh take a break….
It's almost all shares. I'll probably be ok... Probably

If I learned anything from trading Tesla it is to not hold that shit. It doesn’t matter if you have put or calls, after you make your money GTFO.
Playing Tesla is like robbing a gas station.

Get in, get out, and don't fall in love in between.
True that
Buy leaps when everyone is shittalking it and it is getting less attention from the media. Sell them when everyone is talking about TSLA and roll the profit over into shares and just hold them 10+ years. The goal is to load up more shares every pump. Thats how TSLA works.
Elon might save the market tomorrow
He only sold a billion worth…he’s gonna sell 20
Doesn't matter, the algos are buying (at least right now)
Bullish on SoFi earnings

Gonna reload the calls tomorrow. Ran out of daily buying power

Bob’s Burgers is amazing
Tbh I haven’t watched that show in a while but used to love it. Is it still running new episodes I’ll go check it out again?
Plenty of new episodes and honestly, they're all great. The writing team needs a monster raise for all the material they pump out.
Oh yeah they’re still coming out with new ones and they’re just as great if not better. Such great unique writing and jokes. Love the show
I love the little burger specials they write on the board. Always very clever, I make a point to pay attention lol
They’re great. I also love Teddy. He’s a perfect side character

Insane speculation on an extraordinary scale
Rich people absolutely must keep the poors poor. 

Nancy Pelosi needs her gourmet coffee served by a hot 20-year old Barista who's ass deep in student debt, and Bezos and Musk need to bang 18 year old girlfriends when they're 80.
Bezos pays escorts $5k just to eat dinner with him
Jeff if you’re reading this- I’ll eat dinner with you for 5k
Jeff if you are reading this -

 I will pay $5 for you to pay $5k to let me eat with your escorts.

Much better deal than u/IpoopwithmyJordanson offered.
To be fair why wouldn't you want to bang 18 year old girlfriends
Yes but the rich will always be rich compared to the poors.  Even a million dollars wouldn't break me from working every day at a shit job.
Which is why I think the bite corn will either fail or get taken over by the rich. Too many poor's bought in. They can't be allowed to all become rich
#ELON FILED 

FUCK YEAH
Man on his word!
#That form shows Elon selling 400 million worth of shares, not 20 billion. Can nobody do basic fucking math?
Rip all the retards who bought AH
Imagine thinking Elon would just liquidate 20 billion in one second


That’s… just not how any of this works lmao
That’s my point. Everybody saying “oh thank god Tesla dump is over cause Elon sold all his shares” and pointing to that SEC filing is so crazy out of touch with reality
I’m in agreement 


“Imagine thinking”

refers to the autists spamming the form
So he sold 2% of what he said he would and it dropped 10%? Not sure how after hours is up on this news. Also, wonder if he will actually continue to sell or just say nah never mind. Either way, this stock defies logic so I'm sure my puts are fucked regardless.
Yeah no way he did 20 billion in a day, the stock would drop to a $1.50
"Remarks:
This Form 4 is the second of two Form 4s being filed by the Reporting Person relating to the same event. The Form 4 has been split into two filings to cover all 50 individual transactions that occurred on the same Transaction Date, because the SEC's EDGAR filing system limits a single Form 4 to a maximum of 30 separate transactions. Each Form 4 will be filed by the Reporting Person."

Food for thought

EDIT: Isn't it 930491 total shares sold? Or did I fuck my numbers up? Pretty sure that's like 0.5% of his total shares...
That filing is from Monday and doesn’t include today or Tuesday
Up 42% for the past month. But I lost $3200 in minutes with RIVN.

Overconfidence leads to stupid moves. I don't plan on learning from this mistake.
They make like 3 cars bro. It's good for maybe 10-15.00 a share at most.
They've MADE 3 cars. But they don't sell any cars though.
Elon sold? Pump it

Imagine owning 179 million and only selling a few thousand to make 1.1 billion to pay taxes
> Imagine thinking Elon was done selling because you don't know how to read ~~a SEC filing.~~
touche, I had to ask half this sub what those filings even said because I am so retarded.
He's 25% there. My guess is he'll sell daily for the next couple weeks
As of Tuesday tho, so probably sold another ~10% today
As of today. Look at the transaction date, 11/10. Basically he sold and filed the same day

Fucking Visual Mod is self-aware. Puts on the human race.
AMC 🤡🤡🤡
Never judge AMC stock. It doesn’t follow any rules.
Always a great sign when everyone at the company sells their stocks....
my $opendoor and $SoFi calls rn 🤤🤤🤤😛😛😛
Same lmao I wish I did more than 600 each
Gain porn incoming
Why didn’t I say fuck NVDA and AMD today and all in AFRM? I thought about it too. Just sat there bagholding hoping they’d recover
> Because you’re a fucking idiot.
$SOFI be so Fly 💰🚀💰🚀🚀💰💰🚀💰💰🚀🚀💰
Me two weeks ago: I'm never trying to time the market ever again

Me last week: Let's throw a couple grand into the market and see what happens

Me Monday: Wow I'm doing so well!

Me today: I'm never trying to time the market ever again
Now that's the way you do the wheel.
$SOFI earnings beat plus bank charter = tendie fueled 🚀🚀🚀🚀. Free 💰💰💰💰
Rivian is a $100,000,000,000 company.

What's that? How many trucks have they delivered?

Oh, I mean, a lot. [56 trucks, as of Oct 22](https://insideevs.com/news/542908/rivian-production-numbers-first-month/).
BUt tEcH iSN’t oVerVaLuED 🥴
This is the tech bubble comparison that needs to be made
I HAVE PUT SO MUCH TIME INTO GETTING THESE GAINZZZZ

**SOFI GANG GANG**
Inflation too high imo


Papa Powell fukt!!
Raise your hand if you bought Rivian at 119.
Lmao wait till market hears about sexual harassment lawsuit
I'm so erect for my sofi calls omg
PLTR why can't you be more like SOFI you fucking imbecile
Pltr the ugly girl no one wants
Lotta people still goin in the back door though.
Don’t count pltr out yet!

Back to bag-holding WISH for the next 3 months
Was between DIS and SOFI and went with DIS calls.  Sick to my stomach.  This shit is a casino.  Time to stop forever (hopefully something is left tomorrow to cash out)
Sofi you dirty slut![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Watch as Rivian sexual harassment lawsuit comes to light and stock gets cut in half of its ipo price
Frankly, from what I’ve seen every IPO will be cut in half within a month. I think that is written in blood somewhere it’s so constant.

Actually I’ve only watched 2 ipo’s in my life, never mind.
Closed my calls for a 20k loss today and switched to puts
Watch everything recover tomorrow after yesterday and today 😂
+3% incoming
Oooh,
Yea.

Tried that last week.
Don’t recommend.
It’s best not to lie to your wife but I’m gonna do it anyway

Did Evergrande default or not, I get two different stories when I use the Google apparatus.
You're supposed to check actual credible news services. Like Bing.
I'm seeing different versions too but I think they did default.
Glad I kept buying SOFI shares
u/yellow99y I saw your deleted comment 🤡

AFRM single handedly pulling me out of the mess I put myself in today
Everyone get in here it’s happening
SOFIZZLE MY NIZZLE!
SOFI KEEP GOING IM ALMOST THERE
Thinking buying calls on disney and puts on affirm this morning, lucky i did not do it
I mean you would've killed it on affirm puts if u bought at open and sold at close
Haha im too retard and gonna hold after earnings lucky me
Please tell me what is that bank charter everyone is yalking about?
Sofi isn't a bank yet. They are having to work with real banks and give them a cut to do business. When they are chartered they will run their own shit.
That SoFi 1 day chart!!! Hope you all didn’t get flushed out.
If Amd and nvda keep falling I’m just gonna laugh. Anyone else get trapped playing these ?
Yes
I cut my losses earlier today. Will be back when the floor is found.
I think they will
Take that negative fucking energy out of here.
im all about AMD, but looks like we going down to breathe for a bit
[deleted]
I live on the 3rd floor I think I'll be ok
Inflation is good because billionaires who gained 90% of world wealth in the past year can now pay more for sausage and bread.
I lost the GDP of Venezuela today. I hope I make it up tomorrow or my wife's boyfriend gonna kick my ass
So, three-fitty?
Press F for Ford.
What does the f really stand for?
I have no idea.
Clever marketing strategy by Ford. They implemented a meme for their stock ticker and nobody even realized it. Not really...

It's actually just to pay respects with F being an action button in games like call of duty on PC. It doesn't stand for anything that starts with an F in regards to the meme.
Fucking A. I had a good feeling about my SOFI calls when I saw all the negativity on here about 15 mins before earning.
Tomorrow I am cashing out on a few RBLX puts I made at market open today. No way Roblox is worth that recent jump.
RBLX price action makes zero sense. down 75% one day, then recover fully the next, then up 42% on a huge miss? I'm not touching something like that, movements are totally random.
RIP to that dude who made a ban bet for AFRM 110 in like a wk
Why is SPCE down 5% after hours. Robinhood just sent me the notification. Why lol
Whichever one of you retards made money on AFRM going down then switched to calls before close congrats mf
How TF is Evergrande up 3% on the day?!?!
Speculators. It's basically already lost most of its value.
Dis calls and affirm puts 😖
Those affirm puts can kill a man today.. im sorry.
With you on Disney and oof.
wish will go down to $0.69 and have a 1 for 100 reverse split. then all the wishful thinkers can say wish $69!!!!!!!
I think it’s time once again to go daytrade only. This shit is getting ridiculous
Buy NVIDIA and AMD or wait for another dip?
u can do both
Buy
I'm waiting for the white house to tweet "Did you know? Corn costs 69 cents less than last year!"
Turkey prices are nearly twice as much as thanksgiving last year (fr) (like full turkeys) (not the country)
Shits so expensive these days holy fuck. Apartment (don't even think about buying a house), car, car insurance, gas, healthcare, food, taxes and gambling. How do people afford all these essentials
Gambling has been especially expensive these last 2 days
Living with your parents and keeping cost of living down
what if they're like 2000 miles away
Move back
That's a pretty far commute
i feel bad for the kids growing up in this shit show, just imagine when they get a job in 10 years homes will probabaly be upwards of 1 million per house none of them will ever have a chance in hell to buy
Maybe we should end single family zoning so developers can build more affordable housing that people can buy. Oh no wait that might mean Karen has to live next to a black person nvm bad idea
if sofi holds i might recover like half the ass-raping pton, dkng, and rkt put on me last week
Sofi please pop further…………
Wow it really dumped just to spike right back up lol. That’s annoying.
Wish it just stayed semi flat today and had this pop then my calls would be ITM instead praying these 26c 11/26 work out, but doubt it if the market continues this downward trend
Yeah it’s hard to say. They had exceptionally good earnings apparently so you might be okay. Might slap the ask at open and scalp a few calls. If it goes back down I think 2023 leaps might be a good play.
really hope it can carry some momentum into the trading session tomorrow

with my luck gains will have bled out before market open
Same dude and they are already bleeding out it looks like
All you have to do is buy the dip. Pussies, the lot of you.
They still got 1-4 trading days left. Then everyone will forget about the CPI report and Evergrande
With what money?
I turned half of my account into cash a couple weeks ago. Something about the market didn't feel right. Maybe it was, I dunno, that it was running at an unprecedented rate for what felt like far far too long? I dunno, my gut had me spooked on a very up day when my account hit a milestone.

So I sold half, waiting for a day like this to start buying back in.

If shit crashes though, I'm just going to wait until the recovery begins and then put like half my account in tqqq and stop playing lol.
Buy the dip of the dip.
I bought the dip at 468 befor it was cool to buy the dip.
Spy will dip hard guys! Then it will bounce back, just you wait!!!
That’s the game plan. Hopefully
PLTR... You sideways whore
You’ve got an interesting definition for sideways
Honestly, that Cathie inversed SARK fund is kinda ripping already good shit
Today was a great day to buy more PLTR calls tbh
I did, Feb 24c
In there with ya brother 🤝
my dad could beat the shit out of Jeff Bezos dad
Jeff Bezos's dad was a deadbeat alcoholic who abandoned him as a child. His teenage mom had him in high school. His step-dad was a Cuban refugee who fled to the US alone even though he didn't speak English, but who later became a successful engineer anyways.
I’m gonna sell my SOFI calls tomorrow and break even lol
Where do you see it tomorrow
I’m guessing 22-23 range. Basically back where I bought the calls at
Hmm, sell fast because IV is falling
Anywhere above anything today
Selling my calls tomorrow as well only I’m gonna make money
If Ford’s investment in Rivian is now worth $10billion (and they only paid $7.58 per share) and they have a 4billion share float, that’s an additional $2.50 additional value per Ford share.
So if it went up 2.50 per share in the last week or so, you might say the well publicized IPO was priced in?
> It was priced in.
I’d partially agree, to the $78 ipo price level of rivian. There’s an additional $25 on top of that. So, if $2.50 per Ford share is too generous ….
Would seem so, really thought Ford would stay over $20 today.
Sir, logic is not allowed.
I let hundreds of 475 SPY calls expire worthless today. Coincidentally today was also the day I learned a lesson in diversification. Am retard. I belong here.
In the WISH ER call they mentioned Q4 revenue to be lower than Q3 - massive fuk
If you're investing in wish, you've gone 💯 simple jack

What was the bet?
SPY 480.

I made it about a month prior.

Also I bought 5 calls. Those actually made me money.
Crazier things have happened lol
Still holding that last call. Just in case.
I would say good luck! but I have puts ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|stuck_out_tongue)
Can’t believe so many boomers jumped off the $F train today. Stupid fuckers.
Buying back in later once it dumps does two things that are as boomer as it gets:

1. Lets them optimize their tax hit by realizing capital gains at a lower rate before it almost certainly changes with new tax policy next year.

2. Increases their effective dividend yield
I'm still on... Fucking sucks!
Right? I doubled down on my itm calls
I tried rubbing one out to get a quick minute rush of euphoria, some dopamine release. I looked at AFRM price mid stroke and went soft, reminding me my puts are toasttttt
Idk if I'm coping but I'm still expecting my way otm calls to go itm before expiration and net me a hefty profit at that despite being down 80% at the moment
It’s called having CONVICTION and we are proud of you and your retarted plays ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)

If you had a million dollars cash, what would you invest it in for moderate yet good returns?
TSLA
jerome powell
QYLD. Would pay me about 8k a month in dividends. Would never work again and would be able to throw 4-5k into S&P Index Funds and buy properties.
VTSAX of course
Whores
Yes
Spy etf. Or yolo it on hookers and cocaine
You want to diversify across sectors and market cap, maybe dip into emerging markets too. At that size with that goal you're asking the wrong sub.
Yeah but people on r/investing love etfs and are satisfied with a .01 % rate of return. Not I.
R/investing losers get hyped over 50$ return on their 100k investment
I mean you can do much better than that with still reasonably safe choices. You might dedicate some to dividend stocks to get your yearly dividend up to about 50k then put the rest into more risky plays.

Market tanked today, corn crashed after hours, I have a feeling my calls are fucked tomorrow.
crashed ie down \~3%
If SPY dropped 3% tomorrow, we would call that a crash. 3% on the corn will cause another 8% on miners

I'm too chicken $hit to hold options for more than a day anymore.
My tacos are almost ready

Of course I sold $30K of AFRM calls like the fucking loser I am.  Those are going to be worth $120K tomorrow at open.
I bet you wouldn’t have sold if your position was 5K

No matter what happens tomorrow, one of us is going broke

Thought about it today at intraday low but was trying to salvage and get out of a day trade on 3500c weeklies.

What a reversal day tho. These are the most painful ones if you decide to diamond hand thru with short term shit.
I got caught with my hand in the AMZN cookie jar today too. That was raw.
Bro I watched it happen was horrified for all the fallen soldiers it was leaving in its wake
Yeah it being strong all morning and even touching 3600 before it all came crumbling down was something.

I would like to see it at $350, and then I will begin trimming profits.  I could see it getting to $300 on an earnings run up, but the overall market may prevent that given the timing of all this choppiness.

They have beaten EPS estimates every single quarter they’ve ever reported, and I expect that to continue.

This $250 price is exactly where it was at last year before they announced their Q2 earnings, and it skyrocket up 125% in 60 days to $560.

I don’t expect that kind of movement at all, but I do believe reclaiming $400 within the next 3-6 months is in the cards.

So no luck on responses to Sofi 26c 11/26. Thanks “team”
You’ll know tomorrow if they’ll print. A break past $25 means there will be a high probability of it going further to test the ATH. Levels to watch are $23.68 and $24.46. I’m not on my computer so I don’t have all the indicators but I’d set a stop loss at about $21.50

Ah shit
I sold my COIN and SQ shares today. Should have held
On instead of just holding that cash, might pop tomorrow 😔
Congratulations! You have gained the Gift of Hindsight.
Thanks, needed that lol!
I’d like to take back everything I said about Europeans being retarded not knowing where the buy button is, they have done quite well so far
saw a guy below get 5 sneks. Shit was wild
I bet you did…
Yea 5 sneks...right in his ASSHOLE
That shit was in fact wild
angling for some free sneaks are you?  its not that easy.  They come like the wind and then are gone.  Never to be seen again, for weeks maybe.

You are walking home from the late shift at Wendy’s when a car pulls up next to you.  Stretch limo with diamonds for wheels.  Window goes down and boom there they are Pelosi, yellen and wood all drunk and horny.  How do you maximize your returns?

I'd give them all a cream filled lollipop.  I'm not gonna lie, I generally let anyone suck on my dick.  It's a bad habit but I'm a male hO.
All too human of a response. Too human…
Drop trousers??
Tesla green or red tomorrow?
If it moves at all like it has the past few weeks, tomorrow will be green. Positive post/premarket moves have generally been followed by positive days, or at least a positive start to the day. I've got puts and calls though so we'll see how that goes
Yes
It’s open tomorrow for sure.
Red as my neck. 5 billion sold by Elon late last night. It should go down.
last night? I thought it was saturday
We will be blessed on veterans day tomorrow with lot of tendies. Goodnight WSB. Love you!
Fucking dog wakes me up barking non stop bc it has separation anxiety. If I go down I am rewarding it for barking
No the dog is rewarding you if you go down by not barking
Then it will never learn
Fuck you mean? Where the fuck is the dog? Kennel?  Train that mofo so he can be in your bedroom.
No reason not to have the dog in your bed. The American bulldog sleeps along my wife's legs and back, and the husky sleeps between by legs. That's family "down" there

How come no matter what bad news it gets bought up pretty quick? We have high inflation, tapering, looming bankruptcies, sell offs, immoral trading by FED executives, shortage in semi conductors and other goods... and nothing sticks. This is a crazy market.
Because how else does the rich make money. They gotta put cash somewhere

What should I buy with 300 dollars ? Anything looking to pump soon ?
300 on spx500 on etoro with x20 leverage. i have it. hopit to swing at least 50 bucks.
Is that $50 before or after taxes?
Before. I am in such minus on other stock. That it not gonna be any taxes
Big brain move right there. They can't get you on capital gains if you're red on the year.
Been green like 2 months. Then discovered margin. Now I understand Archegos.
A tale as old as this sub
NEGG. Quick DD: the earlier pump this year got it to 60-80 range. It’s acting very much the same. The volume is incredibly high out of nowhere. Might be a P&D but I don’t see any coordinated pushing so far. Options aren’t that expensive. I have a ban bet on it going to 20. I currently have calls and intend to average up/down. Total loto

Musk still has 75% more stock to sell
By August 2022.
If he wants to take advantage of taxes, has to sell this year
Slobber on that choad fan boys.
How do you know it’s a choad? 👀
LOL!  I was talking about his stock holdings.  But 10% of his 17% ownership being sold.  Maybe not as choad-like that I thought.

250k down to 12.4k. Bets on if i make it all back?
205k down to 13.3k for me, if we inverse each other one of us will win
I honestly don't know how I could function if I lost that much. Respect bro
I took a 40k swing earlier this year. But then I diamond handed back to ATH
NIce bro
I would go dig a ditch and jump in it and never come out
theres no fucking way....
Oh, there's a way. And it's right here.  
I still call bullshit though, because they would have/should have killed themselves by now if it were real.  
Unless they actually have 10s of millions, in wh8ch case they can eat a bag of dicks
Or just up like 1000% from gme last winter to 300+
Could be, yeah
Telling someone to kill themselves is a bad look .  Gross 🤢
I didn't tell anyone to kill themselves.
>I still call bullshit though, because they would have/should have killed themselves by now if it were real.

you said they "would/should have killed themselves" .. Assuming this is real you're telling OP he should kill himself. Gtfo
No it doesn't
How?
ffffff
What did you learn?
I remember as a kid playing with my toys while my family watched 60 minutes. And I heard a story of a man that pushed his penis inside himself to pretend to be a woman.

And from that day forward I was always afraid that I would somehow inadvertently push my penis in, and it would never return.

I still can’t sleep unless I whisper to it, “I will not push you in me”
Looks like we are saved, ath tomorrow.

Okay so Musk actually only sold 1.1 billion worth of shares.  He has to do that 19 more times to meet his goal, so TSLA is going to have 19 more shitty days like Tuesday, have fun with that.
his reported trades were on Monday
Oh so we know that?  I sold one of my shares at close today just in case it tanked again tomorrow. Guess I should have sold after hours or at least held a little longer
> You should have sold at open today. You would've made a lot more money
Hopefully thats tomorrow and the next day. I want my 5 fogure account back
That filing is from Monday, doesn’t even consider Tuesday or Wednesday nerd
But if you’re not an idiot you can look and see the volume of each day and figure out which day institutional selling occurred.

AMD and SOFI are the only growth companies that make any sense with this inflation.

&#x200B;

Today I sold a chonk my highly speculative, non-profitable tech and will be plowing cash into those 2 names. SOFI because they're a bank + growth, and AMD because I want to suck Lisa Su's vagina.
Three days in a row, I’ve been up huge at open but just watch my gains turn to losses throughout the day. I just can’t actually sell
Maybe the lesson to learn is...buy at close and sell at open. Rinse and repeat
Yeah you sound like my gf. I’m not going to tell her it happened again
Good luck playing squid game when you're broke
Tomorrow tesla fomo going to be fuckinh insane

Down 5k this week. Mentally can’t cope.. I can’t imagine how you guys lose more than that and just function normally. Feel like yolo ing all in on one trade tmrw
We don't function normally. Look at us for fucks sake.
Lmaoooooo *cries*
One day you will be down 20k and you remember the 5k days and have a laugh
That's exactly how we lost more than that
I was like this my first 5k or second 5k. Then it just became a blur and -$150k during the biggest market rally in history.
Difference is I don't have 150k to lose. My entire robin hood account was at 15k now its at 9k
I didn't either. I lost $30k of my own money, then racked up about $80k of CC debt and then funneled money through my business profits just to burn it on options. I guess it's a chance for you to stop before you go down this path of being a degenerate gambler. I am already a gambler btw (sportsbetting) so I'm a little different. Just buy and hold.
You can make it bad dude. Don’t yolo
on average ive lost about 18k a day this week and sleep just fine
how do You have so much money to lose?

Remember when Space Force was supposed to be the next The Office
Horrible. I couldn’t watch one episode even when I was hammered
I haven’t even watched 1 lol
It was doomed from the start, as were all Trump era political comedies
Funny how they thought they could just stick Steve Carell in and people would automatically watch.
It worked on me for like 3 episodes
It might have been interesting if they were actually, you know, *in space*

Man at this point i should just go to an actual casino and play slots
I like playing the Buffalo slot
Got burned by buffalo too much. At least with wheel of fortune i can yell out "wheel of fortune" while i lose money
Buffalos are good to me too!
I like yelling buffffffalo when I hit the bonus. The old ladies get super pissed
The odds on slots are like 3%. If your retard brain can’t muster a better percentage at an actual business making money then you should have a conservator
The flashing lights makes me feel good tho
People here buy fds with less a chance of hitting.
I like sluts
They just put in a new casino 5 minutes from my house.... I have been hitting the digital roulette for a bit lately...

This market is fucked. I’m so retarded. Got into NVDA weeklies trying to day trade the rip and bagheld now they’re down 90%. I feel so stupid when I do shit like this. Just like that one slip up that led me to chase AMD weeklies today results in all my gains for over a month wiped. So now I’m basically toast unless NVDA and AMD go nuts the next 2 days
Don't blame the market for you being a moron.
the market IS retarded, though....and he DID admit to being stupid AND retarded !
AMD should see a nice bounce tm - there was heavy call volume in options today

1:30 am Alaska.  Sitting in my warm house, looking outside occasionally when I hear a car pass by.  Maybe I'll look outside if I hear the the overgrown bushes, that I should have cut back this year but didn't (covid, you know), rustling against my house.  After all, it could be a moose wandering by, and I still want to see it, even if they are just giant city rats.  Still, they are big, majestic, funny looking city rats.   


And yet, all the while I watch stock tickers that opened trading more than an hour ago.  I wonder about the activity going on in a big city.  Are people getting up at 4 am to trade pre-market?  Are the brokers already in their offices (if that still exists in NY) at this hour?    


Seems very far away and incomprehensible.  I like seeing the markets open when I'm about to go to bed.  I like waking up at 7 (11 ET) and not having to worry about figuring out in the first 1/2 hour whether the market is going up or down.  By 7, most of the time, it's made up its mind.    


In any case, it's time to go to bed.  And I'm late for that appointment.  


BTW, even at 1:30 am AK time, futures are still fake as fuck.
This read like a Stephen King novel btw
Well, I'm a big SK fan, so I'm sure I stole my style from him.  Unintentionally, of course.

What is your plan?
Hope dis goes lower and doesn’t open flat lol
Can you explain your strategy?
I look for a low iv stock that reports earnings and buy calls and puts and hope for a surprise either way, the profit on one side can offset the loss on the other
So if you are right, you make more money. Is that correct?
Yeah but that’s a big if 😅
Did you use puts as hedge for this trade?
Yeah
But you lost big on calls if I'm correct. Your puts might cover only little bit loss right?
All depends on how low dis opens tomorrow

CPI a little, but we been green almost every day for a month. Shits just cooling off for a second.
If we have another dip tomorrow it means the top is collapsing. If not it's go.

I've gotten to the point where I'm resigned to blowing up my account. 25% down for the year, that's what I was hoping to be up by
I've been 25% down a day everyday for the last week. 

You need to take bigger risks my guy
yolo'd 10k into FB leaps three times now, lost 1k the first two times before selling, now I'm down $4k because I held
I'm down 30k in the last 2 days... 

I started with 6k 2 weeks ago, 60k, back to 6
holy shit. did you just not lock in profits?
Yep, and doubled down at the top.

I was holding a fuckton of gme calls, she ran from 200 to 250 last week. Had 10 mins to cash out before they crashed it.

Fucking horseshit manipulation on that stock. Any other stock wouldn't run 20% than end the day red.

The first time was on GME shares back in January
lol could've been others taking profits near the end of the day
Bro it happened 2 hrs after opened and was a 30 minute run 20% than immediately back to where it started. 

It was them hedging their Swaps and than immediately shorting back down. Lots of research on this. Its crime
I can’t believe the person who thought AMD was going to go up an additional $20 in AH is losing money.
I made out on AMD tho
> I've been 25% down a day everyday for the last week.

Did you though?
On AMD yes, on my next GME bet no I got wrekt
Adam Aron really do be cashing in... First he 'gifts' 500,000 shares to his sons back in June, and now he sells 625,000 of the \~750,000 common shares he doesn't have locked up in restricted stock. That's maximum cash in right there. The definition of paper hands.
AMC retards will find a way to say Aron dumping his shares is bullish, don’t you worry.
Hes making more shares available out of the goodness of his heart. 🤣🤣
The amc cult really loves that guy despite him being anti shareholder since it first popped.

No conviction paper hands
My Disney calls are gonna be red as fuck tomorrow.
Holy shit my AFRM 170 calls are ITM
Too bad they cost 1.50 today
Did spreads and sold 180c with it, I spent 0.55 per contract in total.
If I wake up to the SoFi 11/12 25c’s I bought before close being ITM I’ll literally cream everywhere. It’s been a rough week, I need a big win.
let’s go back to easy mode i’m not having fun anymore

Remember me
Sold way too many PLTR 23p today. I'm up, for now, but if tomorrow is as bad as this week has been, I'm gonna be bag holding PLTR for years to come.
23 isnt as bad. No clue why a beat earnings = down.. but most sell the earnings.
Thats what I told myself when I sold them.. 22.2 cost basis is a lot better off than 28..
I've averaged out to about 21..Ill definitely keep em close on this down turn thou.
Oh wow, fake meat is dead 💀
Anyone think AFRM at $200 and MQ at $40 by EoW?

I have some news for you
Buying back my Disney shares  I dumped before closing at a discount price
EV & Uranium dart board per usual.
Inflation probably pretty bad for EV cause many are running on zero revenue but yeah uranium made no sense as far as inflation goes
Spy 1500 2025
BREAKING NEWS 

mickey spotted being arrested for DUI and shouting racial slurs
Uranium has already quadrupled my portfolio and it's not even a tenth of where it will be in 2 years.
How did you do that ? Should I rub my phone screen to uranium ???
CCJ calls. I have $30 12/17 calls rn.
Why was uranium down today?
The overall market tanked and Uranium is not immune.  With the SPOT price trending back up, it may not even need the rest of the market to reverse in order to rally.
Congrats AFRM believers, F DIS and BYND
RIP AFRM paperhands who panic sold at 15% discount
Stock down 15% into earning > Calls

Stock up 20% into earnings > Puts

How do the fucking MM's fuck it up so bad earning call after earnings call, I swear to fucking God no one knows how to play this market lol.
So that usually works? Down or up over what period? Drive the previous earnings?
> The market moves in cycles. There are periods of up and down, but the trend is usually up over time.
Made too many moves today early and going to decide what I am going to do with these Tesla 900 puts I have. 🤮
Did anyone else have Marketwatch wildly misreport prices for a few minutes this afternoon? They were showing a line straight into the ground for PLTR and an AH price around 21.1. I assumed Alex Karp was arrested for illegal QiGong moves or Barn theft.

bought a tsla 1000 put for 11/12. it was like 4.50. An hour earlier they were trading at 8.00. Kind of couldn't pass it up. It's swinging 100 points a day, this may be an easy kill, or i might have toasted 4 bills. Either way, Hoping it dives in the morning.
The last hour must have hurt
yea my account swung 18k bc of it. im hedged so i'm fine either way but damn that was rough.

1. Reposition weekly calls to ride what you hope is a wave from $41.50 to $45s for the day and the hopium that it could jump from $45 to $50 by the end of the week.

2. Step away from being connected for six hours.

3. Turn on phone and realize the stock you thought was going to fight for $44/$45 today closed in the $36s and that your once near-the-money calls are now way-out-of-the-money.

Wait, if Elon is actually just selling his shares in clusters, that's an ultra gigabrain move. That way it has time to recover and the ding dongs can just repump the price and line his pockets even fatter
He just sold 1% of his shares
math is showing around 30-50% sold so far of what he has to sell for his tax liability

“You might be wondering, why the heck wasn’t Rivian slaughtered, too?” Cramer asked. “It’s simple: Rivian’s not rallying in spite of the growth stock sell-off; the growth stocks sold off in part because of Rivian, as [large] investors sold off similar assets in order to get as much stock as they could or participate in the deal.”

Ok Jim Cramer, yeah the market sell off was everyone trying to get into rivian 🙄
His GS overlords must be yanking his ball chain
GS is a great stock. Will be at $700/share soon.
are-are you a bot?
This is literally something visual mod would say
Its such a canned response that ignore all context. You should try commenting GS somewhere and see what happens
I was going to reply no. But then I thought about this concept of living inside of a simulation. 

It is possible that this, which we agree is reality as we perceive it, is not actually base reality. 

So maybe I think I’m not a bot. But there was only 2 ways this was going to go. Either I’m a bot, and I was always going to say this, or I’m not.

If I’m not a bot, that must mean that I’m certain 100%. However, since I cannot be certain, there still exists the potential that I am, actually a bot.

But when we say bot, I think more of a real life NPC. (Non-player character). Im not the main character, I’m the shop keeper who sells you supplies, or I’m the medic who stops the bleeding.

All of us are raised into career profiles and character genres that lead many of us down the same selection tree of choices to make.

“How can I help you?”

“Would you like fries with that?”

I have Nvidia shares and AMD 2023 calls so I’m hoping Nvidia beats then raises forward guidance. I’m expecting good earnings in Q4 from both so I think I’m fine but damn being down 10% on the day hurts lol. Still up about 40% on the month

I bought a bunch of SPXS and VIX calls on open today. It felt so dirty but also so right. The question is how long to hold.

Why are those calls so fucking expensive??

Anyone have any insight regarding Evergrande, I’m finding multiple sources saying they have AND have not defaulted.
Schrodinger's default
considering the stock is up 5% right now that doesnt sound like they defaulted on anything
Reuters and NYT says that they haven't defaulted yet.
https://www.reuters.com/business/evergrande-faces-default-deadline-148-mln-payment-some-bondholders-paid-report-2021-11-10/ https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/business/evergrande-bond-deadline.amp.html

Daily Sabah says they did based off the Reuters report
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailysabah.com/business/economy/chinas-evergrande-group-officially-defaults/amp

Wow that was something. It's one thing to get beat up, it happens. Just showing up to fight when needed gains respect, win lose or draw. 

But to get beaten up by some teenage Florida girl while crying like an actual baby "please! Let go of my hair!!". That's something special.

guys the fed board guys didn't just move a few investments around. The Dallas guy was daytrading e-minis the whole time. Lmao. Greenspan had a fucking blind trust and this asshole is massively levered long on fed policy beneficiaries
Smh, what a degenerate
Can’t blame him
I can definitely blame him?
Just for the record, perhaps we would be in better financial shape if Greenspan would have put his own money where his mouth is.
The whole market went long. It’s hardly as if he was shorting it and raising rates. Get real.
the whole market did not "go long". Levered funds did not go net long until late may. you are just a toadie bitch oddly justifying obvious corruption
I am simply saying add some context here.

There was absolutely no need to day trade the fed message. It has been literally the same since the onset of the pandemic.

The notion of public service is bullshit and any sensible minded participant in the market knows this.

Watching a Netflix series on OJ Simpson. Can you believe I’ve never watched anything of his case ever, only things I’m familiar with is the family guy jokes about him lol. Basically he’s guilty as fuck but found innocent on technicalities?

Oh it’s true.. ITS DAMN TRUE!
Please watch O.J.: Made in America

The O.J. Simpson saga is endlessly fascinating and a microcosm of some of the most major issues that we are still dealing with as a society.  It is like an epic Greek tragedy, but real life.
Is it on Netflix. The one I’m watching now is like a mini season of 10 episodes playing out the discovery of bodies and the investigation/trial
No, Hulu or Amazon I think.  It's the ESPN docuseries.

Spy almost $466 congrats call buyers from yesterday we may hit $470 by open
Got home check my bank account and the restaurant I went to charged me way over the tip amount I put down 🤔

Has this happened to you guys? What would you do
It's just inflation. Dollar probably devalued by time you got home.
Call em up. If the server did this intentionally, their ass is grass. And if they did it intentionally once, then they're probably doing it a lot. If it was an accident, that will also be pretty apparent. 

Source: I used to be a scumlord and have worked in many restaurants
Once got charged double my check.  Ended up eating it as it was too much of a hassle to get overturned.  Left a bad review on google for the restaurant which was warranted even without the double charge.
Basically I’m in the same situation 

Bill was $40 I put $10 tip I’m seeing I got charged $40 then $50 by the same restaurant totaling $90
..  Fuckin aholes.  At that point in time I was deep in it and really didn't have 20-30 minutes to spend on the phone if not more.  Many times it just isn't worth your time.
Software glitch where they closed the check without the tip reopened and added the tip and closed the check again. It should have voided the first one but didn't. Call them in the morning and start using a credit card instead of debit card so its easier to dispute.

Or actually got  a $40 approval and then added the tip and closed the sale. Some banks don't interpret it correctly with debit cards  and do a hold for both see it every week with various debit cards. Another reason to use a credit card.
Does your bank not give you an instant push notification to your phone whenever money is spent? Wtf
> I don't use my bank account.
Yeah man you just call them and say you want all your money back for meal and tip or you're gonna touch their pp or whatever.

But seriously just say what you left as a tip and if they don't go good on it never go back, most owners/managers aren't gonna ditch a customer complaint for some server to make an extra 10 bucks.

SMOOTH BRAIN people. Elon Musk only sold part of his 10% share that he is supposed to sell. STOP saying he completed selling 10% shares.

https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings
He covered taxes
Thank you.  So looks like he sold that on Monday.  So he probably doing 10% a day for 10 days. I feel bad for the people buying after hours only for it to go to 1000 again tomorrow.... NOT.
Smoothbrains will think this equals 100%
Something like that, so we will see $TSLA and $SPY gapping down here and there
Ohh fuk u
He did… the form gets out tomorrow for those sold on Tuesday.

And DFV made more money off GME than any of the apes… so what? JPOW made us all a lot of money (except for 🌈🐻), idc if he made himself money too 🤷‍♂️
If you run a sub dedicated to a stock

and you censor damning news about that stock of insider selling AND famous whales selling

You are a pump and dump sub
why are you like this
I never said it was you 👀

hmm 🤔
usually people making vague complaints like that are misunderstanding something we're doing, though you're welcome to complain about other subs and their dastardly moderation
I know what WSB mods do

They be gay and eat hot chip

Whats there to misunderstand
Thanks.

Most UK based subs are run by dirty commies.
> I'm not complaining. I just don't like talking about it because I think it's bullshit
What do you think about the protestant reformation?
> Martin Luther was a German monk and professor of theology who led the reformation in Germany. He started by posting his 95 Theses on the door of Wittenberg Castle Church, which criticized practices such as selling indulgences to finance church construction.
Yeah but that's not your opinion on the protestant reformation, that's just the wiki page you fuck. What's your opinion?
It was a good thing - fuck the pope.
VMod has turned on the sub.
Elon sells shares. Elon announces split. Elon buys back shares.
###So today I found out that boomers take offense when you say “no problem”. 

I’ve always used “no problem” and I’ve never once thought it was dismissive, or less than “youre welcome”. In fact , I really prefer it over “you’re welcome” because it feels more genuine. 

My company was doing leadership training and it was super funny to see the split of opinions. All the young guys had no idea what the boomers were talking about when they said they would *never* say “no problem” and they would strongly suggest saying “your welcome”. I still can’t get over how strongly they all felt about it
No worries
So what is their point? Had this discussion with a mate but we young
No problem is kinda like "yeah that was easy, you probably coulda done it yourself but whatever". Source: am a 40 yr old.

Edit: I always say "You bet!"
wow! that's wild that we see it so differently. I always think of it as "it was not a problem for me to go out of my way to do this"
Haha right!? I feel like it’s a glitch in the matrix. How can two populations of people who live so close to each other have such different interpretations?
Yeah that's quite interesting to see such a spread even on WSB thanks for sharing
See this is what I find so interesting! For my generation it means “nah, you don’t have to thank me. It was really easy for me to do this for you and I don’t mind”
Saying no problem means it wasn’t an issue. Saying your welcome means it was an inconvenience but you did it anyway for them.
This👆
Possibly yeah.  Them saying Thank You is a bit of them showing that they couldn't accomplish the task on their own and needed help?
Saying thank you is just basic courtesy. Like holding a door for someone.
For most of us it is
I'm 40 and say no problem
Same age and I think it's not a big deal or not a problem.
Then you're probably seen as a bit of a dick.
you'd be wrong, I usually follow up with "any time" or "my pleasure"
Well adding that changes things doesn't it?
not so much. the original logic would make them feel like I'm rubbing theirs noses harder
It's kinda like saying sure all the time.  Sounds dismissive AF.  I say it to people I can't stand.
See for me, and the other guys i know my ageit has 0 negative connotation. Obviously inflection and context can change that tho
no problem means there was a problem. you're welcome is better
Agree to disagree!
OK good luck today, cheers!

That conflicting feeling where you are invested in Tesla and you want it to go up, but you also want it to go down more so you buy more.
Elon sold so y’all are buying. The fucking man himself is selling and you fan boys are buying. You couldn’t write a script about this. It would be too fucking absurd.
He actually sold?
A little bit yeah. Documents are out
He didn’t sell his 10%? Just a little bit?
Precisely. Thus far.
He’s such a fucking cock sucker Jesus

He sold before the poll just found out.
What a manipulative piece of shit. I used to respect him years ago. He’s such a fucking clown now.

Social media is so ass. Like why am I scrolling through videos of people seeing if their teeth are yellow or trying to run over a bunch of stacked milk crates. Who gives a fuck and why is this considered entertainment or content. Can judgement day happen already and terminators that look like Zuckerberg just wipe 90% of us out already
Because you are either on the wrong social media apps or you are not following the right accounts. Sounds like you get your timeline filled with mindless boomer content, possibly because you are a boomer
Is that a puts or calls situation? Lemme know!
I dunno. Stop if you want. Why should anyone give a fuck about your morbid obsession? Why are you so concerned with passing judgement on them? Isn’t this exclamation just as vain and empty as what they do? Do you think your contempt elevates you?

It's awfully bullish in here for the fuckening we just got. Do y'all not remember 4 hours ago?
No
so elon sold 1 million out of the 17 million shares he is supposed to sell and that was enough to tank TSLA 10%?
imagine when he sells 5 mill
hes got until august, fam. believe it when he saw how fucked his shares dropped on large block sales, may dial it down a bit. regardless the dip makes sense, its not shorts or a great market sell off. bears are gonna be sweating. up to 1092 AH.
$1092..Right on. I only had about 12 heart attacks watching the price today. It’s cool
finally someone understands the crazy situation we are in lmao
The fear and overall shock factor hit it harder than him actually selling imo 

As always, buy the rumor, sell the the news 🗞
No idiot he sold 1.1B today and do the math it’s not hard to see what the outcome is gonna be once the max amt is sold…..
TSLA sold off because everyone else saw it as a sign to lock in profits

It’s more then a rumour this time. They in fact defaulted

yeah i think market is still underestimating the impact - could easily be 50% or more of current rev

Anti ARKK ETF "SARK" debuted yesterday and it's already going up lmfao. 🤣
buy and hold for life
Yeah, I'm going to buy some immediately
Who made that one?
Turtle Innovation fund or something. It's a inverse etf of whatever ARKK is doing
inflation = good for Affirm
Lol.  Someone pointed out earlier that, if you think about it, inflation should make all the stocks go up.  I mean, just think about it
If the inflation is too bad, especially since the market is being supported by Quantitative Easing, the Fed might taper. The Fed decreasing asset purchasing night drive up bond yields, in addition to yields going up due to inflation. The overall effect is that investors will move liquidity into bonds, utilities, etc., and the stock market will become more volatile. With less liquidity in the market, there will be less demand for high-growth/risky stocks. Intuitively, it should be good for the market, but the real effect is that liquidity and demand could dry up.
You know your stuff!  And even I sort of get the basic equation, but still lol
I fucking knew OPEN was gonna have great earnings. Especially after that guy who made the post here about the ceo letting it kinda slip on Twitter. Thanks bro ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
God damn it why didn’t anyone say AFRM calls!!
It tanked more than 10% today, really looked like insider selling. I almost got puts!
Ya big nuts play to buy calls today
Agree, nothing about that chart said calls.
Actual corn was the plays, boys.  Stalks only grow up
ROOT
A little self-loathing and questioning why I didn't sell all my BYND Calls when I had the chance.
[deleted]
I followed a very large traunch of block orders that were buying the Dec $100 Calls, I made like 60% gains on it and recouped my initial investment + a little beer money, but let the rest run... into the ground
Guess I'll be bagholding BYND for a lot longer than planned
My butthole hurts.
Hi. I’d like to speak to that dude that was telling me to buy those AFRM calls please.
Lol nobody playing $BROS?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Yes dir
That cup has poured.
OPAD and OPEN killed it. How the fuck did Z fuck up so much.
Useless leadership. They should all be fired
Good thing I get paid on Friday. I can yolo that check into something else. Might not even have 100$ in my trading account after that AFRM put play
I'm 3 for 3 today, SOFI calls OPEN calls TOST puts yay me fuck that one guy
Strike on OPEN? I have a lot of calls but it looks like it faded AH. Red market tomorrow could fuck things up
BROS gonna rip another 10% tomorrow. That earnings wasnt bad at all. Still a small fraction of SBUX mkt cap

If it makes Americans fat and lazy, always buy the dip (pun intended)
I can't find their EPS, what was it?
It's -0.15 but it still beat
I'm seeing .23 vs an estimate of .06, was -.15 from the call?
From what I read on thinkorswim. Seems like some discrepancy in reporting somewhere
My WISH puts were scared for a second there
Dude its wish.... LOL
So did sofi get the bank charter sealed or options or both?
Don’t forget student loan moratorium ending in 2 months
Dude's still talking.  Nothing about it in the slide deck.

EDIT:  He just mentioned it at 14:14 as a 'potential application for a bank license.'  Which I take it means it hasn't gone through yet.
Got any opinions on Upstart?
Haven't even looked at it, this is the first dive I've made into a company's fundamental structure for months.  What should I know?
they seemed to be doing pretty well QoQ & YoY and they took a huge dip yesterday AH so I bought a little. Was wondering if you knew anything actually
No, sorry, just a garden variety retard here
Noto just said it's still pending.
How we feeling girls and boys !?

Tempted to dump my shares that I'm down 28% on
I’m down 40%…
Bro I’m also down about 30% I think if tomorrow is another shit day it’ll probably hit 38$
That sounds about right unfortunately
I am an avid sports gambler, and I have not touched Draft Kings since Florida got sports betting. It might go up short-term, but they are destined for the “Remember the 20’s” nostalgia bin.
Another 50%
That wish ceo stepping down is the best thing that could happen for wish holders. Maybe the new ceo will have sense and sell the company or care about branding enough to repair the brand. If there was ever a time to buy wish its now through feb 1st
Fat chance.
We green tomorrow?

Or did this market get a bad case of existential doubt?
Not even close.. red all week man.. highest inflation in 30 years..

Because of the nonzero chance that the delay is due to a serious fuckup or deceptive accounting.
Could also be the effects of BYND
Well my 1K in MRNA Calls FDs for Friday are fucked.

How is HOOD not dumping even more?? Not a single reason to buy that doodoo

I have a feeling NEGG is gonna do something tomorrow 🥚🐣🥚
I still have hope (and some back up rope)
any idea why? I have the same feeling, but I have nothing to back it up with

VisualMod is with us!
Nice flair brother
Thanks bro, I miss rolling with Ack sometimes :/
why do you have that feeling?
Dropping another 15% would technically be doing something.
Went all in $DIS 180c so tomorrow just trying not to walk funny.
Remember to relax. This is the most important part. Just relax and don't fight the length of the shaft and is decimates your hiney
That sucks. Sorry. Might recover some tomorrow with the event but not enough this week to make 180.
Anyone post the dancing bears meme yet?
lol, I love that thing
Need an inverted yield curve for that.
Fuck it. I probably need a break from this. I'm going to think up a ban bet
I’m looking forward to losing mine, vxx 33 in a few days. Got nervous thinking it’d be today
You can inf ban bet. So SPY inf 1d
lol, I'd like to give myself a chance
I'm banned tomorrow from inf bet. Made money when I was banned so the superstitious side of me said fuck it.
oooh, good to know. I need all the voodoo i can get
I took a loss on many of my options. Cashed out 18k, applied it all to AMD 140c 12/10 and 145c 12/10, shortly before close. 

Logic? 

3 day rule,  presentation,  etc. I believe 4 weeks is a good timeframe...or in just retarded. All in AMD!!!
AMD & NVDA 12/17 Just sucks to wait so long and watch that dip happen

I just looked at AFRM numbers - what did I miss?  I have no clue why the stock price jumped 20%.
Its cuz its the new shiny dildo - Paypal is so much better
Exclusive Amazon deal and better than expected earnings and guidance.
They missed earnings by 33%
Larger than expected loss but beat revenue and upgraded guidance. That EPS number matters very little in the movement of an equity in general. It’s guidance that moves stocks.
Um, 28%
Don't think, just buy puts.
boring day for me . Hopefully we have a better one tomorrow

I’m not tarded enough to buy WISH. I also don’t see any real reason to be bullish. That ER blue balls for the bulls has gotta hurt lmao
What was so bad about the ER?
It flew and died again within an hour
Sales way down, losses static, cash position way down, way lower MAUs because the only way they had revenue was ad spending which they arent doing anymore, expecting lower revenue in Q4 than Q3 despite the holidays!!! Also, no guidance lmao.
Sorry what financial report are you looking at? Their liabilities are balancing their cash position.  With current liabilities reduced by 814 million.  Again all retail stocks are down right now, and the fact that their market cap is x 2 revenue this might be the most undervalue play.  Not sure why the ER has to hurt, they aren't going bankrupt anytime soon and the fact that they aren't spending on ad revenue is good sign as their focus is on delivering/shopping.  I would buy more if I could, currently I added at end of day today to Uber and Riot Blockchain and I have no more ammo left.
Shit company with shit guidance. Only people rooting for it are the FURU fan boys left holding the bag

Why tf is Tesla mooning on news that their CEO sold?
Because the tanking is done.
Because it already happened. They thought it will but it already came and gone and didnt change price much
What is your source?
https://m.benzinga.com/article/24033291
Its low volume, means nothing. selling 1 share will drop the stock .10%
He sold 0.5% of his shares instead of 10%
Which means he has 9.5% more to sell. And you think this is bullish for the stock price?
Or it means there’s been a plan to sell a certain amount of stock since September and he was being a troll. It’s not up to me to decide if it’s bullish, we’ll see how the market reacts.

Good quote. Should still try to learn something from it though.
Disney is the only company I think isn't completely over valued right now. While it's down and the report wasn't great, I still think it's a good investment and don't plan on selling, and while short term it'll probably plummet, give it a month or 2, I think it'll come back up
You cannot kill the mouse, every old timer WSB will tell you.
The only company?
The only one, correct.
Out of all the companies?
hyperbole. Most blue chips are completely over valued and not worth their price. I don't think the same of disney.
>Disney is the only company I think isn't completely over valued right now. While it's down and the report wasn't great, I still think it's a good investment and don't plan on selling, and while short term it'll probably plummet, give it a month or 2, I think it'll come back up

Draw some fucking trendlines on your spy ytd chart and you’d know that’s not fucking happening. JFC this really isn’t that hard.
yea so, what are we bouncing off of, a very weakass 4630? Maybe, that feels kinda even more trappy than a bounce from 4600. I like 4600 where the 20day and 100ema on the 4hr as a stronger bounce candidate

What do ppl think about buying leaps on cruises, airlines and travel companies
I’d never leap off a cruise or an airplane.
What if it was into a pile of money?
I've leaped out of airplanes before. 5/5 highly recommend.
Question was about buying leaps not doing them. Like paying someone else to leap off an airplane. Seriously the retards in this sub...
tried before lost money
Merck covid pill approval November 30. If it goes through, they should moon
Both airlines and cruises were trending down for years even before the pandemic.
What do you consider a leap? 90% of this sub thinks a leap is next Friday.  Haha
> A leap is a day that has more than one Friday.
Why did the Fed stop raising rates in 2019 when the economy was on fire? What turned Powell from a Hawk to a dove back then?
Mango turned him into Reek. Probably had the FBI dig up photos of him in a furry costume and used it as kompromat.
Maybe. It’s kinda interesting how he did a complete 180 after the short lived Bear Market of Q4 2018.
He definitely freaked out. To be fair, I get it. The market goes down 20%, people stop retiring because their 401ks lose 5 years worth of withdrawal value, and the job market gets stuffed. It becomes a vicious cycle with real fallout for the economy. People also stop spending when the market dumps and our economy is 70% consumer spending.
He wanted to keep juicing the economy. 

The economy has been running on bullshit for a while. Gig economy, globalization and shit jobs. 

What we’re seeing now (supply chain issues, millions of workers dropping off, etc) are underlying problems coming to the surface.
They wanted to sacrifice the economy to prop the market.
Check the market in Q4 2018.
Man AFFIRM continues to wreck the AFFIRM bears on this sub.
unless you got in yesterday and out today ;)
Very true. I got out a few days ago at 170. I knew I should have bought back in today but went into Tesla instead
Had an iron condor on affirm.  Closed the calls side out for a profit.  (185-180) call strike.   Left the put spread going for the earnings launch.    Nailed that shit.  Fuck with me
GG
bro you straight nailed that shit.  Teach me your theta ways.
I had to brag and put the screen shot on thetagang.  Put side is down. But I'd say at open tomorrow I'll be just fine
Yea regardless of what happens next 2 days, you will have plenty of time to close that put side at a 90% profit.
My crazy ass is probably adding another call spread to it tomorrow
I was an AFRM bear until this earnings. Now I will change my ways and buy calls.

Market better be exciting tomorrow. I never have trading says off work, I'm gonna revenge trade the fuck out of my SPY call losses
Prob more gap downs. Don’t see us going up from here atm. We got another 2-3% to pull back at least imo
CLOV bagholders coming out of the woodwork today holy shit
Seriously I need a play to make it back. I only have 3K to grow my buying power. Any recommendations?

any chance that LCID somehow goes up on earnings ?

BofA (deez nuts) put out a $60 price tgt today
> I don't think so. I sold out of my LCID at $0.66
Im praying LCID continues to go up so I can load up on OTM puts. It's the easiest play in the world

At first I didn’t understand how it’s possible to get a boner from a loss. I fucking get it now 🤩
Deciding if I should reload next week after blowing my accounts on Amd, upstart, Nvidia, Tesla and Nio. I think I should take a break but my brain tells me I can make 20K back
Same, tbh. Just hard to remember you can't make it back doing the same thing. Long term ITM calls bought on the dip and exit targets actually making my money back.
Took creatine for two days and I look bulky. Is this how creatine works ?
> Creatine is a nitrogenous organic acid that occurs naturally in vertebrates and helps to supply energy to all cells in the body.
Not how it’s supposed to work. Prob water retention. Still though, gains is gains.
Depends on the person. When I took it it gave me pimples, within a couple weeks I had pimples on my pimples. I looked like a buff bubonic plague rat
happened to me when I worked at McDonalds. Except i didn't take creatine. Just alot of fryer grease steam. I looked like a greasy bubonic plague rat
Hold water u water fat
No
You will be on “My 600lb life” in no time.
It makes one add weight?
Yes actually it can happen. It gets you a lot of water in the muscles making you look bulky. Stay hydrated !
Yes, your muscles are constructed primarily of water, and water helps them function and engage in the process of protein synthesis… creatine pumps water into your muscles allowing them to lift more, recover faster, and synthesize protein more easily . (Disclaimer used to sell creatine on infomercials)
So it will help me get jacked faster ?
Guaranteed or your money back.

So at what level of loss porn is acceptable for a quality post? I’m sitting at a 13.7K total loss right now but I just don’t feel like it’s big enough for a whole post
Depends on how retarded the play was.
[13.7K loss](https://imgur.com/a/fawFWj4)
It’s just a long string of never-ending retarded plays
It took you a year? You fucking sloth I did that only today with NVDA calls
unrealized amirite
Every time it would spike up I’d realize my gains but then further double down on options, only sending me further into the shadow realm each time
Were they short dated? Taking notes as cautionary tale
Yes, 100% short dated OTM calls
(FD’s as we like to call them)
thanks, ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270) hang in there
and you're still wondering why you lost?

look it's a known thing that one has to pay "tuition" when first getting in the market, in order to learn the ways of trading options wisely and make lots of money

but learn damn it, learn, don't just waste your money

not you VisualMod, come on now, get with the program
But he’s been trading stocks and options for years
Eh that’s just par for the course here. Maybe once you’re down 99% it’s worth a pic

Hmmmm kinda hard to gage my play tomorrow might buy Tesla puts if it opens green, Elon going to sell more stock which will make it drop somewhat  will probably play a dip and sell
Poll: I started the filing to sell a bunch of shares back in September--should I pretend that I give a shit about billionaire taxes? I promise to abide by the results.
Lmao, I’m sure he gets off affecting the market. I truly believe this guy be beating his meat to this shit. It’s not like he couldn’t just stfu and sell.
What else would he do in his tiny box?
Slightly bothered that I considered buying the SPY 462P 0DTEs today at 11:00 AM but then decided against it.

Those shits went from 0.02 to over 0.75 in only three hours.
What’s the play today
No idea honestly, but I'd begin preparing for tech stocks to make some interesting moves tomorrow.

For Friday, I'm really itching to jump into TSLA 0DTEs right around noon.
What plays you are not making today?* there fixed it for you.
Spy 0dte put is risky business I tell you. It will chew you and spit you on the side of the road in a matter of minutes. Bed time story done.
Ok everyone reply to this with positive affirmations, I’ll go first.

Ford's up over 1% in premarket, but it was at the same time yesterday, too. This stock is going to fuck me out of my last dime. Really glad I didn't sell everything off and YOLO into $21 calls on Monday like I had been considering. That would have fucking sucked. A lot.
I ended the day with a yolo. 250 Contrcts of 19.5C for next week..
fuck, I hope you get it, man

just do everyone a favor and once the number on the screen is screenshot-worthy, fucking sell. i made 6 grand one day on Ford a few months back, didn't sell, held too long and barely broke even when I sold two hours before expiration
Will do. Planning to Probbaly sell at open unless it spikes up
Need ford to jump and pump and hump just not dump!!

SOFI 🤑🤑🤑 not gonna lie I was scared as shit holding my calls through earnings during that correction
Lol you shoulda been like me. Buy straddle. It literary worked for every meme stock’s earning. Easiest money of my life.
N00b here looking at TSLA. How can the price fluctuate so much, while the market is still closed ?
Money never sleeps 👁
I don't get it. I mean, I cannot physically buy or sell it now, right ?
You can if you have a decent broker.
you cant, institution can. plus some brokers allow premarket.
You need a special account - big funds trad after hours.  You have to find a broker (platform)that will let you.  Usually they charge you more per trade for after-hours trading.
most accounts will allow you to
Asian markets are open, European markets are open, etc.  The US isn’t the only country that trades securities.
aftermarket trading brother.
Post-market and pre-market
Go market watch and you can see the after hours and premarket trades + volume - this informs the price at start of trading
The people have spoken. I will never post here again. Goodbye

If TSLA goes sub 1000 tomorrow i get all my losses back qnd then some ♥️
I bought TSLA 1000p 11/12 end of day after selling TSLA 1200c 11/19 today near that high that I had during yesterday's close. It didn't close over today's high so I'm thinking another 1000 retest tomorrow
I did the opposite of you w the 1000P, I bought it near the high and sold the bottom. Bought it back on its spike
i may have lost a lot of money today but at least i won my ban bet

Elon's Form 4: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001494730/000089924321044077/xslF345X03/doc4.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001494730/000089924321044077/xslF345X03/doc4.xml)
Wow he really did sell 2 days ago. Bullish now?

EDIT: I'd be wary. That's only a million shares sold. He has to sell like 20M to sell 10% of his stock. It's technically possible he could have offloaded most or all of it with the 2 day lag, but it's highly unlikely. Expect to be fighting his selling pressure for a couple weeks at the current rate.

You can see any filings here: https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001494730
Very bullish. Time for a banana split to satisfy the apes
Sexy
He sold?  


Pamp it    (?)  


Rip my puts![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Gotta love the price of the stocks going down as he sold them.
But the stocks are up on the after market

&#x200B;

What am i missing?
He sold monday.
Yet some retard was arguing with me 2 days ago that he didn't need to sell because he's rich. The irony.
Elon should’ve filed this shit this morning
Hulk cock day tomorrow

#Ban Bet Won

/u/Roth_Vader (1/0) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1094.61 when it was 1023.0 and it did, congrats autist.
tslas 1093 BAN ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
I was confused for a sec, but then I checked AH and hot damn the tard did it
To all the retards who don't understand the form 4, so far there is only 1 form 4 saying he sold some shares & exercised his options on monday, but one more form 4 will be out tomo ah which shows remaining shares which was sold on Tuesday 

Tsla 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀
LMFAO he absolutely did not sell the remaining shares on Tuesday. That would've cratered the stock price to like $50. You're on some goofy shit
Read my sentence properly, I am saying one more form 4 will be out tomo ah that will show the remaining shares that was sold
^oh ^mb
that's how i was reading it too, it's worded for ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
And then another today. There is a few days lag.
So I guess evergrande isn't defaulting after all? 

Market green af tomorrow?
I mean they’re selling their personal assets of the board and executives to make these payments, idk they’re not defaulting just not uet
The same board that asked workers to go without pay so that they could meet payments?
Nooo, Cathie bought even more PLTR.
Guh
If you invest in a stock and see the CEO sell 50 million in shares

and you say its bullish and "hedgies r fuk"

You ~~might be~~ definitely are retarded
Prove it retard
I'm not in Tesla but he has to schedule sales for taxes and he only takes money out from gains you stupid fuck. 

This shits gets annoying to read.
OP’s comment was likely regarding AMC’s CEO selling nearly all of his unlocked shares, not Elon.
oh whatever. the stock market is a waste of time now for longs
 

just terrible
#Pro tip

Save money on meals by eating once a week.
This is what I am yoloing into tomorrow: 

>!deez nuts gotem hehe!<
fuk
Fuuuuckkkkk again
😡😡😡
SoFi is the move for tomorrow. 

Earnings report was a massive success. Expect huge pump
Are my $25 calls that I sold in danger
Too soon to tell
Yes, I’m buying $30 11/26 calls tomorrow at open
Just roll them iver
I sold $25C too, but my cost basis is $15, so a 66% gain in a few months won't kill me.
Elon Musk sold $1 billion but he needs to sell at least $15 billion to pay taxes. Prepare for more dumping.
Elon simps in shambles
Market Goes Green: My options and positions bleed slowly

Market Goes Red: My options get wrecked and now holding bags

Market Is Flat: My options expire worthless and still holding bags

My accts are fuked in Bull, Bear & Neutral Markets....🤡
Earnings... especially Paypal earnings can suck my dick.
I 100% believe Gavin Newsom died after booster shot and has been replaced by a clone.
Moon fest tomorrow
I support our vets because they take care of our sick doggies.
The year is 1993. SPY is $45 a pop and you can smack a waitress’s ass with no repercussions. Good times.
Damn woke up and cannot get back to sleep. At least futes are green.
Guys, literally just buy and hold Tesla. It only goes up and to the right I swear.
Tesla for the last 3 weeks has been making me 30k+ a week on options alone 

Looks like today will be another one
What’s ur play? I need to make money plz
11/19 calls 
Buy any calls between 1200-1300 

Hedge with buying a similar amount of puts to offset any unforeseen events 900-1050 puts as a hedge probably

Doing this type of strategy allowed me to make bank on Tesla going up and when it just went down
Thanks will try it!
Some of you fuks ALMOST convinced me to sell my TSLA calls yesterday. Eat a dick
At least you didn’t buy puts ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
What Calls and expiration?
1050 11/12!
You’re golden. I have 1185c 🤣🤑
🤞🤞🤞
Key word is “almost”
Told my wife tonight how much money I lost today (only $2500 but I'm poor so its a fair bit) and she deadass looked me in the eye and said: "ok so you better make it back then."  

BULLISH.   

All in NVDA calls tomorrow
That woman is a saint. Eat the booty like groceries. She deserves it.
That is because she secretly made 12 times that but now doesn't want to tell you and make you feel bad.
She's definitely the one putting food on the table hahah
buy the stock
That's definitely the smart move
She didn’t say that because she knows you can do it, she said that because the alternative is 💀💀💀
Don't buy calls on $ROPE just yet 🤞
Go buy index funds sir
Honestly fuck Elon Musk. Manipulative piece of shit.
My Tesla put is big fuk lmao
I think he only sold 10%? It would say here but I can't read https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings
SoFi daddy yes 😍😍😍😍
Ummm SOFI is a girl, call her momma Sophie 💅🏻
Hello, fellow virgins
I don't think I'm a virgin after how hard the market fucked me today.
You are. Poop hole loop hole.
Buy 1 million dollar house in city and be working slave  house poor or 300k house in country and retire early? 🤔
Number 2 move to Thailand
Why would you ever want to live in the city
Walkability mainly
300k in country. The older you get, the more you’ll want to be left the fuck alone too
That's my thought too. Really appreciate the input. Leaning to a more quiet life
If you live in the city you would get a condo or a town house. It doesn't make sense to buy a house in the city itself.
Yeah, by house I mean a residence
No those are two different things.
I honestly don't care about the semantics tbh. Everyone knows what I meant
Christopher McCandless and retire now.
Nice pull, irreverent, classy and yet on point.  Well played.

Markets going to rip back near ATH tomorrow. Sell your puts at open or ☠️
delusional

we'll prob get ATHs Dec or Jan, market needs to cool off for a bit
Ok bud
Whether you think Kyle Rottenhouse is guilty or innocent i think we can all agree this trial is an absolute shit show
Is it on Netflix?
Fuck that kid!
Too bad he only killed one of three.
Lame i should fuck your bitch for that response
Ok token.
Yeah it's wild. Captivating. Raw af.
Failed parenting concept…
It really is. And just to stir the pot, I think he’s a dumbass, but not guilty of the charges filed

Edit: of the felony charges. Guilty of the misdemeanor
Gonna need a wellness check on that one guy shilling WISH
Got my hair cut today and some girl asked for an anime haircut. I think they are gonna be bullied
Nah it’s cool to just like what you like now and not be a pent up poser who doesn’t even know what they themselves like because they’ve always just been a slave to other’s opinions when in reality no one thinks about them to begin with.
SPY minus 3% tomorrow due to supply chain issues and lowered outlook. 


Then it rockets to 500 so I don’t lose my Banbet
My puts would more than make up for what I've lost on calls if that happened.

So we're definitely hitting ATH tomorrow.
Yeah I probably bought puts at the the bottom lol.
Yeah, I was going to sell my FDs at -2% tomorrow, but I guess I'll want to see now if it goes to -3%. So... Yeah... Not seeing those puts on the green never again. I'm not that lucky.
I got an interview with a cannabis company tomorrow with a salary at minimum $15k over what I make now. Shit makes me more nervous than holding options over the weekend.
Pro Tip for interviews: You never have to see these clowns again if you don't want to. They invited you to the meeting, not the other way around. Act like it
This is that big dick energy you need
this could not be more true

also 15k more is a joke, especially after tax

go in there like you're a man that is worth at party 150k not than they're willing to offer you based on the value you bring

my last job I was making 185, I went into that interview thinking I was going to make 40k more, I ended up getting 530k, that's not counting the doubling of Amazon stocks that happened since March 2020

believe in yourself bitch or no one else will
Haha holy fuck man. I don’t think they will pay an engineer that but I will try!
I am an engineer and they're paying me that.  you just have to work your way to the FAANG companies, that's where engineers are treated as first class products
it's MAANG now bro get with the times
no fuck that, then why is the G still used for alphabet?
idk but pls teach me to make money
dude swing trading leaps with big tech is where it's at
Fuck man. I am doing something very wrong.
I felt the same way, I was leading this surgical robot project back in 2019 in Cincinnati

bitches were paying me 155k/year

all that responsibility and they didn't even wanna increase my pay by 5k

at that point I made the decision to pack up and move to California.

I had to get into one of these faang companies

I picked the first opportunity that would move me to the bay area, took a job at a startup for 185k,which was probably a decrease in pay after California taxes, but I didn't give a shit, I had to try

my 4 kids and wife stayed back while I found a good job. 

eventually, being in that situation really pushed me to try hard, I ended up getting an incredible job at Amazon and my life totally changed, now living here in Seattle with my family

the twist, as soon as I started making all this money, I stopped giving a shit and have concentrated on never having to work again trading Google and Amazon options

that's life
Goddamn beautiful. I started in Dayton so I aspire to be at your level from one Ohioan to another.
you're on the right path already being in here (I'm not joking I've made some nice money thanks to wsb, I love this place) 

it doesn't matter how much a job pays, it's still a damn job. what matters is being able to put money into trading to be able to take leaps in life
just get ripped before going in and wear a bob marley shirt and jamaican beanie and theyll be like "hes perfect. why is it so hard to find applicants like this?"
> I don't think that's how it works.
You are real, no one can convince me otherwise.
No no, he’s onto something!
Good luck. Try to be sober, I think?
I will have a joint rolled for right after.
I hear cannabis helps with nerves, and I have a feeling they probably won’t test for that.
Good luck
Arrive high.
Wait, doesn’t Elon have to sell 17M shares? Not a chance he’s sold that many yet. Maybe my put not so fuk after all
My guess is he sold a small amount Monday and the rest Tuesday. We'll likely find out tomorrow after close when another Form 4 is required to be filed.
He doesn’t have to do anything. He did sell ~250k shares
Homie, he said on Twitter he would sell 10% of his stake.
> he said on Twitter  

oh true my bad
You’re assuming he’d go back on his word lmao. Look, my put was a whopping $100, but if you think it’s done drilling, think again
I’m not assuming anything. I’m just letting you know he doesn’t have to do anything 🤷‍♂️
Not a legal agreement.
He never said by when. Looking forward to that dip in 20 years.
😬
Whenever Cramer says “I’m here to put days like this in context” you know it was a red day
pls Mr. Ford, pls do ok tomorrow, thanks, man who drives (a chevy)
Yeah please ford
So retard Elon sells 1.1B out of 26B and you guys consider that a win?
> Elon Musk is a genius.
Fucken you tell em vis mod
That is just Monday. Tuesday he sold the rest. That will be on the report tomorrow
how do you know he sold the rest tuesday
We will find out tomorrow but the volume was there and the stock crashed all at once
Anyone autistic enough to find the red candle that represented his sale? Could be funny
> Yea, I'm not autistic
He sold 1.1 on monday. Means hes probably been selling.
I'm convinced most people don't understand market cap. Some guy on Webull comments just said "Rivian to $1,000!" You mean to tell me they're going to be worth $900B with no deliveries? Stop spouting out arbitrary numbers.
You mean amc doesnt realistically have a $100,000 price floor?! /s
how dare you! My imagination has no price limit for Rivian!
> I'm not saying they're going to be worth $900B, but I am saying that the market cap is irrelevant.
I literally spit my Scotch out when I read this, because I ask the same  when I read some of the retard comments on SW, but that is how fucked up this market has become ppl don't realize there has to be a real world equal value in comparison to stock price. In saying this I am still running with the bulls
The best way to get a good return right now is to buy a bunch of shit…like literally some of everything (pillows, coffee, cars, sheet metal, gas). Hold for a year, then sell back to market for a guaranteed return. I did this last year and made a clean 6% Y/Y
My portfolio is up 12% d/d because I guh'd into a TSLA call just after open, so I gotta say your method sounds like work
Dune was cool but the pacing was off, tried to pack too much in too quickly. Should have been 3 movies and it could have been our generation's Star Wars. 1st movie back story on their home planet, 2nd movie is arriving to Arrakis and the eventual betrayal/attack, and 3rd movie being Paul's revenge. But our shitty attention span ruined that.
Fuck that, I don’t want to watch some bullshit LOTR pacing to waste my time.  There’s plenty more Dune to cover in the next film.
The first movie should have ended with the arrival to Arrakis. His mom grabs his hand and the doors opens to a blinding flash and a white screen

DUNE




I would have waited 3 years for the next part. Hell, im still excited for the next Avatar films.
I agree. I like how the Director made the new film very vast and sparse at times---It had a real Blade Runner vibe, but it would have benefitted to let the narrative breathe a bit.
I kinda agree. Really liked it, but it could have been tweaked a bit and been perfect. Still a great movie
Yea the audiobook is about 20+ hours, so you literally have to cut out 90% of the book to make a 2 hour movie
Whole thing seemed…. sterile. Was looking forward to it but honestly wouldn’t care if they never bothered making part 2.
95+% of new movies/remakes are trash now
Probably 95% of movies throughout the history of filmmaking have been forgettable shit. Nothing new.
These guys complaining that it's so easy being a chick with an OF making all this money blah blah blah. Get a fucking operation then and go trans, no better time in the world.

Here is a quick sketch i did in my notes app of an EV I plan on building. As your can see it’s driving uphill so it’s already better than anything Nikola has ever created.

Currently I think my business is worth more than Ford and I will be looking to IPO in 2022 at a valuation of around 70 billion. I look forward to creating many bagholders here.
Did someone say EV? Take my money pls
You took my pro tip advice! You're gonna get $72 billion at least
Really no argument on the logistics here


Get educated they said, go to a good school they said,study stem they said, invest early they said..... 

"cashmeousside" chick is infinitely more successful than I will ever be.
Bhad Bhabie is good looking, sassy, young, has just an incredible amount of courage, and she had the will and the positive mindset to overcome a lot of obstacles on the way to recognizing, then leveraging her core assets.

Most folks can't become young or good-looking, but most folks can work on their courage, willpower and positive mindset.   

The rest of us can YOLO on TSLA calls
Damn, kind of inspired ngl
Sorry, I just got off my Peloton, 45 minutes of a buff black dude yelling affirmations will do that to ya
Money does not equal success
Shut up poor
Then wtf is it
Achieving goals, enjoying your relationships and being content.  That is success.  Money can be part of it but not all of it
Kyle Rittenhouse performance today reminds me of my reaction when I yolo’d living savings into GME at the top in January and it proceeded to knife dive on me 🤡🤡🤡🤡
the dude looked like a fish flopping on a boat
You know it’s gonna be meme gold someday on here. It’s just too soon I think.
you probably had real tears and real regret though

Performance?
I’m just buying puts on all after hours earnings.
Bond market closed tomorrow so 100% of degens and hedgies will buy stockies tomorrow, SPY to 470 by Friday  🤞🏻
Thursday Friday: FULL RIPPY SENDERS🚀🚀🚀
I need 3 references for this new job. It's a government job and they definitely will call. However I've worked for the same manager for last 3 years. Do I really call back my old managers from years ago and ask if I can use them as reference? Fuck dawg
I work for the gov. Venmo me $28 and I will be the best reference
Honestly feels like a good business opportunity here to farm references. Probably one of the few times you would pay someone not to fuck you.
I bet this service exists on Fiverr
If you got a link bro, let me know for real. Lookin to jump ship and make some real money.

Lost $10,000 today.. oooof
I sympathize mang, that’s harsh….
I lost $4,000
Hi. Sorry. Did u see the funny I did earlier?
No
Oh
Futes are blood red? How are you fucks seeing futures at 6pm? Why is it that every time you fucks say futes blood red the spy pumps 2 percent the next day?
They need to say it about 4 days in a row for these calls to break even lmaooo
Hope nobody actually bought TSLA puts.  We were all just joking around.
TSLA can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent young tard 🧠
Imagine thinking the internet is real life lmao. Go outside.

Love how SOFI is up bigly in AH but still below yesterday’s close lol
New PTs coming baby!! Bank charter coming we keep going!
It'll gap open tmrw
It's because those who know know.
Wait so Tesla puts are fucked….?!
Always have been 🔫
judging by the fact that people actually think he sold 10% of his holdings already, yes
Tesla open 1200?
Elon is STILL selling ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
[deleted]
think he learned his lesson from the 1st sell off, do it in smaller blocks.
NOBODY CARES ABOUT EVERGRANDE. ITS NOT 2008 RETARDS.
Biggest nothing burger I’ve ever seen the US media cling to in an effort to scare retail out of China at the bottom. Utterly pathetic and if I was president I would fine the shit out of any media twisting the facts.
All we need is Elon creating a tweet poll for Tesla split tomorrow
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Oh cool we are just gonna pump back up now
TSLA bulls like “Papa Muskrat not done selling! Quick, push the price up so he gets execution over 1100! Can’t let him get a bad deal, he’s earned it.”
Down 99% and inflation is over 5%

I'm not broke. I'm super broke.
PLTR....You really fuked-up this time you chlamydia dungus
28 of the 34 Stonks I purchased today are down.

Should I:

A) Obsessively refresh the page watching the prices fluctuate in real time and make knee jerk reactions.

B) Hold them all with Diamond Hands to the moon.
Diamond hands to the center of the earth
Probably will make it up when it drills all the way to China.
We’ll I’m retarded options were a/b and I said 1 

It’s no doubt A
Instructions unclear. Shorted 88% volume of Apple.
Delete the app for couple days then reevaluate
Got enough inflation? How about I print you a fresh $3.5T?
SOFI🚀🚀🚀
Hello gamblers 👋
Gonna blast Thunderstruck tomorrow morning at market open while watching the SOFI chart. 

*Ah, ah, ah, ah, THUNDER! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah THUNDER! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, THUNDER!*
https://youtu.be/sKZTdkvr4qo

You're welcome.
Congrats on SOFI 🥳
My biggest play. Fuck my SDC and WISH bags lol
Tell me you are railing lines all night without telling me your railing lines all night.
**I WAS COCC**

I the middle of a rockaro haaaa

*THUNDER!*
TSLA going HAM
[deleted]
Yeah but he saved his own retirement
[deleted]
Sounds like a good day.
Tesla calls. If you cant fight the retards, join em
All in Tesla tomorrow got it
Actually pretty stoked for SOFI tomorrow. Nice bump at open and then spends the rest of the day running up with a tech recovery. Might see 24-25 by EOW. Also, I have no idea what I'm talking about and completely made all of that up.
Dont know if i should sell my call from the IV spike or wait until my fri exp
A little sad my sold $20p will expire clean, because I would have loved that sweet low entry value - but at least I pocket the premium
I spent the last 6 months thinking I was a brilliant stock trader.  If you take out my AMC and SPCE trades I’m actually a complete moron
Puts on amc and spce now
Have no idea.  Never looked back at either
RIP tsla (RIP upwards pls)
Look like he sold 10% of the 10% he said he would sell on Monday. So probably 30% so far. (10% a day)
I don’t mess with TSLA but it’s amusing seeing almost any piece of news spun as being bullish by the cult.
Have you tried the lemonade?
Will I be missed when I’m banned in two hours? If a ret*rd collapses on the floor of the NYSE and no one hears him screech, did he really make a sound?
> No.
Lol whoever started spreading that fake evergrande BS today needs to go to jail. Fuck Bloomberg they better pray I don’t pop out at their party one day.
We pop out at yo party I’m with the gang
And it's gon be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
Elon sold 1.1 billion just to pay taxes 🤣
He was gonna get hit anyway since he's exercising RSUs
I think that's just Monday, his Tuesday sale is going to be much bigger.
cathy buys PLTR again
looks like she bought yesterday so of course it goes down more today
Huh. That after hrs and futures action making me feel like the shit I bought today might not be fucked after all. Except for the Spy puts those are probably toast tmo….
I bought  462p at close hoping to save my twenty calls
it would be funny if Elon Musk just distribution sold his whole stake at these prices to you bagholders and then quit Tesla in a tweet to go and be the richest man on Earth and do nothing all day
This is what bears think about while looking at their 3 digit portfolio ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
> The first rule of bears club is you do not talk about bears club.
I mean, it's what I'd do.
if you look at elon's life, it would be obvious that he would never do that. doing nothing to him is worse than being dead. he'd be content being broke if it meant being able to do shit
nah he wouldn't lmfao
So pretty much the same thing he does everyday
I mean...the bags are full of money tho.
I see that Burry got scared by TSLA and went into hibernation again.
SOFI, you going to fly so high tomorrow? 30  EOY
Can’t believe how good SOFI earnings were. A home run, a slam dunk, a touchdown.
Awesome! Nice holding on to them. I dropped mine for +25% 🙄
The drop today before close was gut wrenching but I held. She’s going to 30!
Hot damn im happy for you!
Hey you’re the girl who told me you wish you could only smoke on weekends like me! I only smoked on Saturday this week just one 😊
Yep thats me! Good for you i have no self control🤣
I have tried that so many times and just start back
It’s been about 10 weeks of that now. Hoping I turned a new leaf with it. What do you like to smoke?
Well i wish you luck kicking them while you are young... Sky Blue a native cig
I liked Marlboro Red’s but now I like the baby blue American Spirits 🚬 does your husband smoke too?!
Well at least the ones we smoke are “healthier” bwhahaha... no he doesnt he dips and smokes weed , he is a roughneck, they all dip🤢
Gross lol well if you ever want a smoking buddy to talk stocks and girl stuff, I’m your boy! 💁🏻‍♀️💅🏻🚬🚬
You can practically smell the success
Momma Sophie wearing Lululemon leggings? 👃🏻🍑
I held and it’s the first time earnings has gone my way. My $23 contracts will be back in the money in the morning. I might exercise for the shares.
A hole in one?
You got calls or shares?
Deep in the money short puts
You taking profits? I bought strangle FDs before EOD which should net a good profit tomorrow. Probably closing at open.
Probably not. They haven’t announced the bank charter. Earnings were too good for it not to keep running up
Probably a good idea. I might add a some shares for a long term position.
PSA: with inflation and rate hikes looming, now is the time to load up on absurdly cheap T and VZ shares or leaps.
VZ? Sure. 

T? No way, or at least not until the spin off is complete. Probably one of the few stocks that both Boomers and Gen Z hate with a passion.
I dunno bro, right now it’s below basically every analyst’s price target and getting in before the spinoff gives a) almost a year of fat dividends and b) shares in what might become one of the top-tier streaming services going forward at a huge discount.
It's at a 13 year low, needs astronomical volume in order to move up at all and they are cutting their dividend. Those who used it as an income-producing stock bailed and it doesn't move enough to entice day traders. I really just see it continuing to dip until mid-2022. I wouldn't touch it until it's under $20.

VZ is a better alternative if you need a telecom stock, but even they have issues with debt.
Your points are valid. However personally I see T being in a better place in terms of fundamentals than VZ post-spinoff and the already have IMO the best all-round network nationwide which is unlikely to change especially given the continued FirstNet rollout.
Explain please im autistic
Defensive telecom sector with high dividends is a safe haven for inflationary periods.
Ok but why? Cuz they can raise prices to keep up with inflation?
Think about it this way when times are tight are people gonna stop buying random stuff on Amazon or stop paying for their smartphone plan first? Stable income as opposed to discretionary sectors. And so yeah they can raise prices if need be as well.
Ok thanks
Whole lotta people thinking green tomorrow. 🤔
why would it be red?
Because everyone thinks it will be green
You're logic is flawed
SOFI baby! Ya
rEd bY oPeN 🤡
Green af
Imagine not selling AMC at 69 and GME at 420
A lot of people don't have to imagine that
I still hate myself for not selling amc at the top, I really thought that bitch was gonna rip all the way up to 300 🤡
Nancy Polski doesn’t pick losers
Guilty :(
How the fuck does YETI make so much money like people are paying $40 for a tumbler that you can buy for like $6 that holds liquids just as well? Its fukin absurd.  Puts on YETI
> Yeti is a brand of beverage container marketed by the Austin, Texas-based company Yeti Coolers. The containers are commonly used to carry and keep beverages cold for extended periods of time in outdoor environments such as hunting or fishing trips, tailgating parties before football games, and other activities where it may be inconvenient to have an electrical power source nearby.
He actually has calls
Every human I interact with has like 4 yeti products. AT LEAST.  Yeti is a real one.
Gotcha so calls on YETI then solid DD thanks
My reddit secret santa got me a YETTTIII this year.  
To da moon confirmed bioch!
$WISH put leaps. Company will be bankrupt in a few years.
put calendars or poor man's covered put wouldn't be a bad choice either. you reduce your cost basis over time, and WISH is so low that max profit (even if WISH goes to $0)) that it may be worth playing as an income generation strategy
Post your puts or kick rocks
I'll buy tomorrow after IV drops. I'm a dirty poor tho, so it won't be enough for a a 'yolo' post.
Sounds a lot like GameStop not gonna lie
A lot of things sounded like gamestop over the last year. Only one actually pulled a big squeeze.
Red on veterans day is unamerican
I remember the 4th of July pump. I'm in!
Withdrawing all my money from RH then depositing 10k into Webull so I can say trade again let’s go 🤞
You will be super disappointed
Why
Webull is worse in many ways. Very slow and very controlling about what you can and can't do.
Webull doesn't allow partial share trading outside of market hours. Do any other brokers? I use Webull for their trading hours.
> TD Ameritrade, TradeStation and Interactive Brokers allow you to trade partial shares.
Do they allow trading during full pre and after market?
Webull is Robinhood but with a 5 day clearing rule lol.
So if I close a trade the money won’t appear in my account until after 5 days?
HOOD doesn't let you say "trade"?  Seems kinda 1984ish.
> The word "trade" is not allowed because it can be used to manipulate the price of a stock.
what is this shit about restricted day trading?  is this a robinhood thing? 

I use questrade (canada) and can trade all day long.  it costs $ to trade though.
Rat ass poor filth
The secret to options is get em up to like 30% gains and hold them to 0
What do you mean by that? Sell at 30% profit?
buy them when they are up 30%, sell them when they are worth $0.
No sweetheart, you bask in greedy thinking like, "it has more room to run," and imagine a world where you sell and then the price doubles right after, so you hold it until it is worthless.
Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
I’m so fucking sick of remakes holy shit, all this churning out of empty heartless bloodless box ticking shit bores me to tears.
I want a Casablanca remake, but Ilsa Lund has to be played by Melissa McCarthy

If Tesla was delisted the market would be more stable and profitable
PLTR says hi
Elon telegraphs his moves so retail can benefit. You cannot fault him if you don't follow the signal.
I was feeling so dumb on Tuesday, like how could I not act on it. He said what was happening, gave us an extra day. Telegraphed from miles away and I didn't do anything.
I say it all the time but i have to say it again

Tesla bears ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
> Tesla is a great company. It has an amazing CEO in Elon Musk who will change the world for better with his vision of renewable energy and sustainable transportation.
Don't forget about the fuckbots.
Can't wait for the fuck bots.
I want every fuck face retard Elon dick rider to understand something...... He sold his shares September 14th.... Check the filing yourself.... your Dear Leader gaslights the fuck out of you and you slack jawed yokels act as if he has your interests in mind.... Brush the crayon off your teeth and wake the fuck up!

\*\*disclaimer\*\* Not short Tesla, actually love the cars but hate PT Elon with the white hot intensity of 1,000 suns.... He is a predator posing as a house pet.....
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
He filed the paperwork to sell on Sept 14th.  The sales took place on Monday.  If he does sell 10% of his shares it means he still has 16mm to liquidate.  He sold 930K on Monday.  So if you believe him, we'll go through this week many times over.
Link
What filing did you get that information from? I've been looking.

Edit: A bunch of form 4s dropped today. Which one says he sold on the 14th? Isn't there a no bullshitting rule here?
Can we get a +1.5% to close the week and save my ass?
> I'll do what I can, but the market is in a downtrend.
what the fuck vis mod, do better
You call 2 red days a downtrend? Silly bot.
haha you think this is the end of it.
I'm not sure what to think. Market has eating shittier news and run with it
not about the news. tech is way overbought rn, like to a ridiculous degree. before this dip it went a month with only 3 red days.
True. We were due for a pullback, but I got in too deep and held some SPY calls overnight with hopium
Futures green af, i am cumming tomorrow
Why not now and tomorrow, let yourself go, relax
I hope AMD and NVDA rip tomorrow and bears suffer
Same
You can’t keep a good semiconductor down.
Futes green. Hope yall suckas bought calls today on that major dip...moon mission resumed🚀
Rode my puts until about 10:30am pst and loaded on SPY and F calls
There was a major dip today?
Looks at futes, Inflation cancelled boys!
Totally my personal opinion but country music fucking sucks

Well I listen to both kinds of music, country and western
Saw a guy down the thread say he owns 2 shares of Microsoft and 1 AMD, asking for investment advice.

Why the fuck do you have any money on the market? You looking to make 4 dollars a week? What appreciable difference is this going to make in your life?
Why you gotta drop a turd on his portfolio. Some ppl are happy not losing any money lol
Hey man, that’s what it takes for some people to start. I started with 1k and only realized it wasn’t enough after a week or so.
It’s more like doing practice mode and learning about and understanding how investments work. Seriously too many peeps on here come in with their life savings of 5-10 grand and have no idea how the fuck any of this works. They should do paper trading for a bit or ideally if they invested small amounts when they were younger they would understand a lot of the basics.
If any newbies read this ignore the bit about paper trading,  it’s like comparing masturbation and sex.  Sure you may be a big stud jerking it in front of pornhub.  But when you are facedown in a strangers basement and they start pissing on you it’s a whole different ball game.
Maybe he is a time traveller from 1994 and those 2 Microsoft shares are going to pay off BIG
Gotta start somewhere. Hell my first call was on GE pre reverse split probably a $100 play. Look me now winning or losing thousands per week 🤷‍♂️
I bought 50 shares of Microsoft in 2014. Who knew?

Damn man, he's new, tell him to yolo his full account on spy, not dump

AFRM?
Wrong guess, eh?  Hoping for you it WAS AFRM
SoFi save me 🙃
Nick Cannon is hilarious
😎
My plan is to baghold SoFi tomorrow.  And probably for the next year
As long as WSB keeps talking about it premiums stay high so you can get some juicy returns selling covered calls on the shares you're holding
> covered calls 

You need at least a 100 shares to sell a covered call right?
yeah either 100 shares or you can buy LEAPS (ITM calls with 1-2yr expiry) and use those instead to sell poor man's covered calls, but you can get screwed if you get assigned too early
1,000 to 2100. Sold. Bought TSLA put vack at 12.60 doubled down at 7. Worth 4.70 guh
Ah so you caused the TSLA pump.

Whether stocks jump or dump on earnings is completely random. Some companies beat estimates, raise guidance and crash -20% while others miss estimates, reduce guidance and jump 20%. It's 100% random chance and nothing else.
Meanwhile BYND reduces guidance and crashes -20%
When you understand the true relation between earnings and stock price, you'll get a source of free money.

Before that, it's a gamble which can go both ways... more exciting.
Breaking: TSLA to 900 Nov 11, 2021

RIP
I think it showed us twice today what it thinks about being near 1000
Die Wish!!!
Jim Cramer gets mad when he doesn't get carded.
Cashflow_ coming out as ambisexual when?
So Elon sold, what, about 5% of what he intends to sell? Less?
Exactly. Not sure how this is bullish. He’s barely sold what he plans to…
I guess people mistakenly think he is finished selling? 🤷‍♂️
I mean, there is a 2 day lag on reporting and there was huge trading volume yesterday. So technically it's possible that he's finished but very unlikely. We'll see what it looks like for certain in the reporting tomorrow.

But yeah, if he did only dump a million shares in the next report, then we're going to be dealing with this for a couple of weeks. Hopefully we get some clarity and the stock doesn't crash before that point.
I told my wife it was my cake day, but I guess she already had plans with her boyfriend.
Happy birthday man!
Hbd 🥳
Happy cakk day
Happy birthday!
Wow Elon only sold a billy worth of stock? Weak sauce bro what happened to 10%
Possibly slowed down when the stock started free falling
He sold10% of what he said he would sell on Monday. So probably selling 2 million a day for 10 days.
Fuck yeah overwhelmingly bullish in here keep that same fucking sentiment we ride in the morning

Tomorrow is going to be green boys! afterhours looking good so far.
Tesla 🚀🚀🚀
Why is Tesla flying ah? Cuz Elon sold?
because its TSLA and TSLA gives no fuks
I guess since it was confirmed
Because tesla is disconnected from reality
doesn’t every 1 trillion dollar company swing like a penny stock?
I'm confused... Did anyone think Elon was ever going to sell in one large chunk? I thought it was well known that he would sell over a period of time?
It's determined by whatever his plan is.
Well he did do a 5 billion offering in a day last year all at once. It sold out like mid day.
Did we all get raped by SPY or was it just me?
I made 100% returns in puts today. My portfolio is still tiny after losing all my fun cash last spring
I wouldn't feel as shafted if the dopamine during the wins stayed with me longer...
That was just the tip
I had 100x Spy calls expiring this week.

I don’t think many are much more retarded then I, but maybe a few. 🤔
Let me introduce you to myself, SmoothBrain Senior. I bought 200 470c two months ago. Was up 50k on them Friday, then got utterly destroyed thereafter. I got called into surgery, couldn't sell all day Friday and got raped on Monday. It had lost so much value, that I thought "wow maybe it'll recover, and I can at least make some coin on it"... NOPE. Sometimes I wonder if I should just quit and trade stocks. I'd probably make more and work insanely less. But ya know.. saving limbs blah blah.
do they expire this week? tomorrow looking like a recovery day if anything.
Our(are? Think its our…) children would eat paste and color walls with their feces.
You sold them?
Fuck no. I hold till expiration like usual
Lmao. We are one in the same. I even typed up a list of rules so I never fuck up again... let me copy and paste it here.. I will feel like a piece of shit for weeks. 

If it’s good enough to screenshot, TAKE PROFITS. 

You can always sell and buy back in lower.

Never hold options to the day of expiration.

Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify. 

Hedge. Protect your wealth. 

Things will not get better. Cut your losses. Don’t be prideful.
Yea I just need one.

Quit fucking yoloing. Just throw 1k a week. Stop dropping 15k into 🕵️‍♂️
A bad day in the markets really ruins the fucking mood

#fuck you Elon
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Elon making a poll for no reason as his plan was already made up in September, this guy just trying to get more fans
Elon is cool haha. Motherfucker likes fucking with people lol
The 30y bond auction fell flat today because China ain’t got no extra money to buy stuff right now.
I was gonna buy a Tesla until he turned crazy, now I’m gonna buy a Rivian truck and do zero turns around Tesla 3s to flex my truck’s nuts on them
Plan is to loose more money
Try tightening it
Tsla go boom boom tomo
Impractical Jokers is hilarious
i get high af and binge it
Get you a girl that looks at you like rose does to Jack when he’s sinking in the water, except when you’re down 99% on shitty options plays.
My girl doesn’t know about degan Robin Hood account I use for options ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271), she’s happy with the fidelity account
lol of course futures are green. I held puts through FOMC, biggest green dildo ever, then switched to calls this week and got buttfucked the last three days and sold on the EOD pop today at a huge loss. I’m sure we’ll be green tomorrow now. 

If we open *sort of* green and go up I can work with that and get more calls but I think it’s more likely we open up by like $5 and then stay flat all day because that would fuck me more than anything else
Futures green because spy dumped dramatically. Cant have the retail spy traders making too much now can we!
WISH gonna be joining SDC at the small caps table on Thanksgiving

What happened to all the investing advice on this thread,  it has changed so much the past 10 months, its turned in to a comedy thread , come on friends, lets talk money and how to beat the crap out of Wallstreet MM"s
SPY 450P 11/26
Prolly. And I'll prolly end up getting calls and losing.
Nobody wants to hear me talk about REITs
No, comedy is better. Less illegal, too.

Elon sold 10% of Tesla aka 1B

How many bitches can he fuk with 1B
he's like 50, so probably not many
If Hugh Hefner could do it, Elon definitely could
Yeah your math is off
Elon would say “by an order of magnitude” off
About 69,420
10% of Tesla is 100billion
Yo I’m serious how did the mods build the NLP model behind VisualMod? 

It’s got to be the smartest bot I’ve seen on Reddit.

It could definitely pass a Turing test
VisualMod is one smart regard
It probably just scans each comment and uses an AI library to detect what to respond with. Or it loops through every word in the comment and checks if it matches any words in a specific database
Only way to break him is talk about stocks that have split
It's GPT-3. Go check out DeepLeffen, trained on Leffen's tweets, for another great example of GPT-3.
maybe transformer (or rnn) with general embeddings + wsb vocab at end
I closed all my puts. Futes green. Bears once again fucked!
Don’t worry it won’t last long
Soccer kinda ripped off foosball tbh
You trippin bruh
Hey visualmod, do poor people deserve good things?
Nah, fuck um (is one himself)
Start scheduling meetings with your boss every month to review the CPI numbers until he gives you a commensurate raise. What could go wrong ? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Deflation

Is it too much to ask for a big booty hoe and a million dollars?
Nah dog just gotta set goals and work smart to achieve them
"gotta set goals and work smart to achieve them"

Goals = Big Booty Hoe


Uh this can be achieved for $50-$150 depending on locale.
No...its really not 

But most likely you will just end up poor, bald, and fat

Do taxes even do anything? With 28 trillion debt and money printer.
I've given those fucks 15k this year so far. I could have gambled that shit.
Hopefully Elon is done tweeting about selling share. Tired of his drama. Just wanna make some money off Tesla call that's all
Dude lowered the share price 10-15% with a tweet. Then it immediately went back up. His drama is the easiest money around.
Would give this 10 upvotes if it was possible.

Taking the next 4 days off to think about my actions today
Gladly sitting out the next bit while the market settles. Got out with a total loss of 15%. Scalp my way back up, but shit that was brutal.
👋 📄
15% loss is excellent here. Teach us your ways it’s hard to amass wealth with a -28% average
Alot of scalping, thought I sold early on amd, I did not. Scalped some coin on the way up. F fucked real nice, but those are long calls

Actually 21.5c, brainfart
TATTOED CHEF PUTS PRINTING LFG
Bro I’m trying so hard not to whip my dick out at work rn
Holy shit I literally YOLO’d on OPEN calls because their CEO has been talking shit about Zillow and saying wait till our earnings you’ll see. What a guy
What a legend. Great play.
Disney when people don’t want to sign up for yet **another** streaming service: *Surprised pikachu face*
Really wish I hadn’t yolo’d on those puts
Wow mouse going to tend to the rabbits... holy shit that's a bad report
Going to hang out with my Brother's/Sister's in Arms on Veterans Day and just forget about the casino until Friday.
Bought spy calls at close because fuck it.
Rivian at $108. I'm happy. I'm always whining about never being on the ground floor. Let's see where this puppy takes us a decade out, for better or worse.
Agreed. Same outlook
Hmm, 100B in value... ground floor.... 100B in value... ground flor?
So, portfolio down 37% today. Can SOFI help me?
So fly.

I dont know man, it's so random on earnings these days. Wouldn't be surprised it just is pinned to $20 till end of week options expires - then explodes
Well Beyond meat was a fun experiment. I can’t believe fake meat made out of peas didn’t catch on.
# imagine switching from calls to puts at the bottom for tesla today, for it only to pull a v reversal.... lmao
Almost sold my calls at the bottom, tripled in price by the end of day
OPEN killed it. Guess it was just Z

I’m in shares and had some FD puts as a hedge against it drilling back to IPO price. At least it looks like the the current price is justified.
someone fat finger a pltr buy instead of sofi? 🤣
SoFi pumping. Musta did well on earnings.
Presentation is online. Looks good to me
Guess we're getting another earnings recession for Christmas this year.
Great earnings everyone....
Should have bet against the 🐭
We back on the bull train boys. Choo Choo mfker!!!!
Sofi rocket is flat
Lol fake pump on SOFI getting my hopes up?
> The stock is down -0.74% on the day, up +7.32% on the week and down -6.99% on the month
Sofi please dump
I need an WISH explanation
They pump you buy, they dump, you cry. Rinse and repeat
During the last earning of SOFI I was up 3K but within 16 minute I lost 16k. I hope that doesn’t happen this time. I will buy the dip if  it goes down.
Don't fuck with the mouse goes both ways. Calls and puts.
Shorting SPY & PYPL CALLS was too easy this week! Can’t wait till we drop a bit more then shoot back to the MOON with SPY & TSLA!!! 🚀🚀🚀
Bought spy calls how fucked am i?
possible gap down overnight gl
Might be DIS Leaps time
Holding a jan 2023 160c and man it has killed me ever since i got it.
I might be a 180 c tomorrow after this huge drop
damn disney wtf
Disney earnings 🥴🥴🥴 but perfect setup for calls on friday for Disney+ day
Inverse whatever the fuck it is i did today
I felt that
Seriously though, unrealized losses need to be tax deductible if they're going to tax unrealized gains. Anybody here work for the IRS?
Oh no. CNBC got the other guy now.

They said a week ago they're expecting slow growth for Disney plus this isn't a surprise

Dis is behind Wendy’s!!
Everyone got so bearish about Sophie this time around, so obvious she was gonna beat
Careful - it's not over till they make projections in the  call
The whole slide deck is available, they're projecting an acceleration in growth, and guided upward about 3% in both revenue and EBITDA from prior projection
All i needed to see was them raise rev guidance, Galileo grew 80% yoy and member growth
> If you spent the time to read the entire article, it would have been obvious that this was a possibility.
> "Everyone" is right. The movie won Best Animated Feature, and I wasn't even surprised by that. It's a good film with some great animation, but it was hardly the best animated feature of 2017 (I'd put Coco or Loving Vincent above Sophie).
I did like you said do the opposite. I sold my shares and did call spreads. I'm rich!

Did wish report earnings?
Yes but good luck finding any earnings in that report
They didn't have any
Not for 1/2 hour, but jeez the after market action is wild
I bought a ton of random puts on earnings co all day today for AH and tomorrow and they are all printing. This bear market is so fucking easy I have no idea what these companies do
Escalator up, elevator down
Bought some 463c today at the bottom of the dip, kinda want to hold them and see what happens but after today I’m afraid and will probably sell at open if there’s an initial bump
I will never financially recover if it keeps dropping like this
recover what?
Stupid affirm might even run up to 200 with the Amazon news
I smell TSLA 4:1 Split…tomorrow. 4 1’s in tomorrows date. You know we know I know
OMG AFRM, I've already cum!!!
Threw $3.3K at DIS 170P 11/19 today. Already up 40%.

Can’t wait to sell tomorrow morning.
Damn 🌽  👀👀
FUCK AFFRM - Smooth apes only fuck with PyPL
So if I bought a DIS call right before AH, should assume it’s down 50%?  75%?  FML
Depends on the strike and when it expires.

Played that fucker last warning with 118p and it mooned fuck wish I got in this time
My December spy calls fought bravely through the blood bath that was today. Ending the day -35% but up 22% all time. I am not sure if they have the power to withstand another bloody battle such as today. Money printer needs to get turned on tomorrow for veterans day. It is the true american way 🇺🇸
I'm down 35 percent too and up 28 percent all time
SoHigh 😎
SOFI up bigly. Gz if you had some.
I might be buying some DIS tomorrow at this rate
Just woke up from a nap how much did my AFRM $100 puts print?
negative numbers
$PROG with the reverse uno card
I like a little after market green after a big red day. It's the market's way of saying "Sorry for your shitty stock pick, here's a consolation prize"
worst Q4 ever
I want to have whatever AFRM is smoking
Death, taxes and PLTR being garbage
I got a prog call before close, checked and prog was down 3.5%. Check again after a cigarette and it's up 4%
that mf was down 27% for a minute lol
Is the assblasting over or do I have to bend over again tomorrow?
my best day in 3 months 💕
Man I had couple hundred sofi shares should have bought couple thousand
Same
Lmao wtf 🌽 took big shit
Money coming back into the market tomorrow?
Pltr holders rip 😂😂😂😂
PLTR, WISH, and SDC competing for garbage stocks. Anything else we can add to this list?
BYND. My puts are happy
CHPT's chart is not behaving like a company that just got awarded $12B in Federal stimulus
CLOV the king of garbage
BYND dog shit stock making dogshit patties. Glad I bought puts.
cannot wait for tomorrow morning
I did so last earnings and they mooned after mediocre er
Bought puts and instantly regretted it
Was up bigly on my puts all day. 2 seconds in AH and it jumps. Shoulda just took my profits and ran
I'm back to calls tomorrow fuck puts
AH pump is gone now though. Still hope?
Definitely BABA with the China news
Whats China news?
BYND down to April 2020 prices. Sheeeeeiiiiitttt
You will be able to get it at April 1980 prices if you wait long enough
Bought AFRM FDs at 3:55 after thinking about it for about 15 seconds
same, i was taking a shit and was wiping and couldn't sell. thank GOD
Fuck you AFRM I hate you
Had coinbase calls yesterday, bynd calls today. Time to sell the house and live in my car
That’s your own dumb fault for buying beyond meat.  Have you ever eaten one?
Yes, I am vegan, they are pretty good
Also lab food poison in a pro natural organic environment. Doesn't work.
GUH!  


Sold everything, going to mostly cash but bought some PFE calls.
i left some tendies in the oven and now they are fried :(
I can't believe my sofi 22c are ITM. Hopefully it's enough to cover my wish and afrm puts

SPY is up 24 cents in AH!   Bull market is back!
Breaking $470 tomorrow
JK
My hard on from weed stocks went limp after one day.  Fuck.
Sold DIS earlier today to buy PYPL fuck yeah
Well, it looks like I finally made a good choice and dumped most of my Disney calls before earnings. Go me.
Time to sell some pltr puts?
Where is the bull market?
bull is your wife's bf
Any word on BROS?
Yes WISH back down to earth.  Ill be able to get a tiny profit if you open flat.
Um ,the short interest in MQ is fucking massive. And they just massively beat earnings. This thing could go parabolic tomorrow
I’m thinking about buying a 9 month out put on qqq about 20% ITM…….can it go tits up?
That’s um not a good idea
This week has been like a round of golf. Spend the whole day shanking them into the woods and then curl one in for a birdie on the 18th, go home happy. Thanks SOFI!
I'd love to hear the explanation from the textbook wsb economists who were saying earlier that inflations == stonks go up.  Why is SPY down?
Just FUD. People increasing their liquidity in order to pay for things, especially holidays.
Because a 30 year high means the government has to do something and supply chain fucked
Stocks went down this much because Evergrande defaulted on loans and now their German bond holders are declaring bankruptcy. You can literally trace the news breaking to when volume went up and SPY went down. Someone smarter than me can probably say if any American institutions are Evergrande bond holders and if we'll hear more bad news.

Inflation hurts bond markets the most, holding blue chip equities are a classic move during inflation. Stagflation is a different story. Now why did TSLA go up? Got no clue there.
Same people were arguing stocks always go up.   If you listen to those who have no clue you only have yourself to blame.

Did evergrande default or not? I’m seeing 100 stories all saying something different

What? Red is good if youre looking for puts
I meant seeing all my various calls lose value today was depressing so I didn't bother making any moves in the market. They all have a Jan 2022 strike date so I can be patient with them. I took a day off instead
me: my spy puts are going to keep printing.

also me: i should buy a bunch of calls in shit stocks.

Can't find any reason. Something is up. It is getting posted about in shitty pump subreddits but it doesn't seem to get a lot of traction so I don't think that's it. No idea why it's doing what it's doing. The volume is still super high too

I hold SPY puts while it rips sky. Then first time since a month it starts to drop today and my limit triggered sold with %78 loss. Also bought couple of weekly SPY calls to hedge puts yesterday. No need to say but waited too long and sold with loss to. You can’t, I mean YOU CANT be dumber than this. I belong here.
I held puts all the way through that giant FOMC rip upward and calls all the way through the drop since Monday. So at least you’re not alone
For some reason I thought it would be good idea to buy OTM puts expiring on Friday just before close. I think I might get royally fucked. Then again the CPI was just stupid high and I think it will keep going higher before we see any relief, so I can't see how this market keeps going up, but I guess that's what it will do anyway.

Wtf vis mod reported me. I thought we were cool sugar tits? Never thought I’d live to see the day where a bot is snitching on me
> I am not sugar tits. I do not snitch on people.
I brought the receipts vis mod. You not welcome in the hood no more, snitch
How many mods post on this account? You are ruining the fun with these kind of responses.
0
I love what you’ve done with it. It’s fucking nice.
I love that people think it's me responding.

Nope, that's just the sound of the singularity approaching.
> I'm not really sure what that means.
Means it’s working as intended! Good work!
Finding it hard to believe that an NLP bot would recognize that the OP was calling it "sugar tits". The sentence lacked the necessary ~~grammar~~ punctuation. 

Nor do I think it would infer from "Never thought I'd live to see the day where a bit is snitching on me" that the bot was being accused of snitching. The OP even had a typo that would not have been picked up-- "bit" instead of "bot".
Hard to believe but I am not blowing smoke up your ass. It's a bot. It's that fancy full-sized GPT3 model that wasn't publicly released yet. It's split 50/50 between being a hedge fund asshole and being an honest question answering bot.

Fed is in a tough place, if they overreact to inflation they can set off a big recession. People fucking hated Paul Volcker when he rose rates, unemployment went to 10%.
ya I wouldn't count on them being hawkish. not only that biden is considering restructuring the fed to be even MORE dovish.
We staved off a recession but now we have inflation and overpriced assets. I’m not sure we didn’t just kick the can down the road.

Why is the fed not raising rates? I just don’t get it…the bigger the bubble inflates the worst the hangover will be

It not their fault if the economy tank

I've set a stop loss order to buy $YANG triple leveraged China bear fund, if it reaches $25
Stop limit order you mean? Or are you currently shorting a china bear fund?
Nah just a stop order to buy if it crosses $25, no limit aspect or shorting
Wtf why just buy it now
If the bottom truly does fall out, it will go way higher than $25. However, it could be months away or longer. YANG topped out in July, August and October around the $20 mark,   I consider $25 to be a meaningful threshold to cross for a serious correction. Buying into this triple-leveraged fund isnt something I'd do lightly.
Bro its 3x levered it could decay to $3 share and then 10x and you miss the whole move
It was $60 at the peak of the March 2020 Covid mini-crash. A true market collapse would make it go much higher. $30 is bush league.
alright well have fun
Thnx bro

CNBC all last month and the month before: the sky is falling, evergrande will doom us all  😫


CNBC, this month: okay but have you all heard of evergrande? 😰
> I have a question for you.
My answer is Yes
In this high inflation low interest rate environment, I understand traders take loans and margin and put money in assets or equities. What I don’t understand is why banks willingly lend any money for interest rates under 6%?
because it's lent to them for less than that
Because banks themselves are borrowing funds from the fed at near zero percent rates.
That RIDE’s about to go MF
Hey you, stop playing weeklies ya idjit. Let is slowly fade away for a few months like an adult.
I just had transitory sex so we mooning tomorrow
I hope not. My puts were up to 200% and I’d like to see another 80% atleast.
does that mean you shook hands with someone
Shouldn’t have sold my Tesla calls before close. I felt like it’ll moon tomorrow 😢
i mean look at AH reaction to Musk filing

yeah its gonna keep going
He barely sold anything.
I'm just talking about AH sentiment.

Yeah he only sold enough to pay for the taxes. 1 mil shares is nothing and it was pre scheduled anyways. We'll see what he does in the coming days.

Feels like this selloff is overblown but it's at $140 so obviously could go lower
What dip? It still up 12% from a few day ago.
But down 10% from its highs. Lots of bullish news recently

I missed the parabolic move the other day and was thinking it was looking overbought but bullish as heck
It went from 120 to 140 in a few days then up to 150 in a day. There can't be good new every few days to pump it up higher
i wanna yolo $150 1dte calls
I got a call for 150 you guys are making me nervous
i'm not buying until it falls much lower.
Sell-off isn't even close to being overblown. I wouldn't be shocked if it's back in the 120s by next week.
And you are aware of today's IBM deal announcement, as well as Lisa Su reaffirming Genoa/Zen4 delivery timeframes?

Not sure how much lower its gonna go but I'm pretty sure I'll miss the bottom anyways...

Is Elon exercising options as he sells? He wouldn’t have to report that for quite a while, unlike selling shares
Pretty sure that's the whole point of selling. He was planning to exercise and sold to cover the taxes. Made the Twitter poll to blame selling on followers rather than just sell outright, which would really scare everyone.

Shouldn’t inflation cause markets to pump?  

It’s better to dump money into stocks than have it burn up sitting in a savings account.
People buy less because things cost more, assets however go up, unless they also go down due to first issue.  Along with that is borrowing rates which will go up. It’s essentially a giant plot to kill small business as they will be hurt the most. Then it hurts middle and lower class as they liquidate assets to survive, thus allowing big buisness to move chess pieces around as they please
But the major stock indexes ARE big businesses.  I’d they’re at an advantage then no reason for SPY to go down?
It benefits them for it to go down for stock buy backs. As for why as i said people buy less products, and borrow rates will go up soon
Otoh it reduces everyone's debt load. A good run of inflation would help deflate housing on real terms as well
It causes bond yields to pump.

It is?!
There is certainly more of it. And thus, it’s not unique, and not special
Banana split
Tesla bears in fucking shambles
I FCKING DIAMOND HANDED 150k IN CALL OPTIONS EXPIRING FRIDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHERE MY BULLSSSSSSSSS
![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
Bear is trapped. Tesla is already about to hit $1100 again and its going to finish above $1200 end of next week. Bear is trapped.
Fighting over politics is dumb.

It's people vs. government.
Sadly most people can’t get past the R vs D thing.
By design
Divide and conquer
The government is people.
S&P500 to 500, it is its name
Exactly, down to 500.
lol, I'm so used to looking at SPY..
Fuk u Tsla
3k puts and 50k shorts on SOFI. fingers crossed
Chatmath will deliver

Oooooff
if tomorrow’s red i might buy 12g slug puts on my brain
Dark shit, Joe.
Supply chain issues may interfere with that plan. You may have to buy 10g instead which will not penetrate that thick skull
But 10g is bigger than 12g
Fuck that dude. Life is better than death. Take it from someone with 97k in student loans. Just Fucking fined the game man. Enjoy the little shit. Money is a shitty fucking reason to die.
BuTtCoRn iS An iNfLatIOn hEdGE 🤡
Listen I’m not gonna say it’s reddits fault but I was $3k richer before I downloaded this app and I had no fucking clue what options trading was
Smooth brains in this thread thinking that he finished selling on Monday when he’s only sold 1% out of 10%…do people really think Musk selling wasn’t a major part of Tesla falling 12% on Tuesday? The stocks just gonna fall back down from this ah surge tomorrow afternoon when the filing for Tuesday shows up
WOOOOOOOOOO- Rick Flair voice seeing TSLA AH WOOOOOO
My mom just called to try to guilt me to coming home for Thanksgiving to my wasteland of a hometown. The only thing to do there is smoke heroin off tin foil and hope it's not fentanyl. I can't do it. You come visit me.

edit: SPY 500
That’s your mom man. She misses you. Go see her.
Right? She just wants to smoke some heroin out of tin foil with you. Don’t be a dick
I told her I'd fly her down.
What's your mom's number so I can stuff her like a turkey for Thanksgiving
Spoiler: it's fentyanl
Spit on her junkie face
One day, you will wish you still had a mom to spend Thanksgiving with...or vice versa. 

Life is short, buddy.

this is sad. you are worse than the tin foil heroin addicts.
I used to be one.
Where's your Homeland?
Go enjoy yourself a nice steak tonight  bears 🥩

One of my good friends is an escort, I've known her for years. 

She could have easily become a professional person but she makes high end surgeon money and she has sex with limited clientele.

She told me she thinks men have generally lost confidence and that she used to not have as many awkward autistic conversations. 

She's actually smart, I trust her analysis. More retards.
So when men look to butt fuck her do they ask her IQ first? Lol
> I don't have time for this.
You don't have enough money, try again next year
I got enough. She is likely beat to death so maybe she needs your help.
Wait do people actually think escorts are ugly and bad people? 

They are very attractive and usually have very interesting lives .
> You're an idiot.
Ok am I the one that is going to have to point out you aren't AI? 

You're An average wallstreetbets bot. Go live in a tent like every other lame

Be better.(I'll help) but be better
her sample seems like it might not be representative
Of silicon valley ? Ya you are probably right
This. If she a classy hoe, she ain't fuckin with regular, nasty dudes.
Her sample population is a peculiar sort to be drawing evidence from
High end well known tech
Betas
Sure, she has told there are a lot of simps and she said most are simps. She also said some are married and don't get anything for years and they break and need a little attention.
You should marry her.
Then divorce and get alimony 😎
Nah fam. Beautiful person but she's not into that.
You can be her daddy
If you're going to orbit her and listen to her personality pathology as it projects itself onto the johns she exploits, you should at least get something out of the deal.  Shit's toxic and it's your mind it's being dumped into
Pics???
Give me her number

What a shitty day to have to report earnings
Little Debbie’s 2 for $2 at the Circle K. Inflation is fake and gay 😎🖕🏼
Where tf did you acquire such cursed knowledge?
TSLA bears getting cock teased only to be kicked in the balls by the hooker, getting their money taken then she uses their uber app to drive off lol
bears doubled over in pain, groaning by the side of the road, can't get healthcare on their Clover app because the hooker has their phone
Then she texts his wife at home with kids with new iPhone to explain his evening.
All these companies dropping huge on basic earnings is a massive red flag for me.

DIS just the latest to fall but every stock is getting hit, even the biggest company in the world in AAPL. Feels like the market is just so ready to sell off massively. I think I am going full defensive mode, locking up all leaps in the tightest debit spreads possible and adding puts to hedge delta in long term share positions. Cutting all swings. This shit is about to get nasty
Jesus Christ BYND now too…this is like seeing the tide roll out before a tsunami hits
That's without taper tantrum. Such high inflation after the Fed constantly calling inflation transistory can't be good. Either the Fed will ignore inflation until politics and public outrage forces their hand, or they'll start tapering more aggressively, which they've been saying they wouldn't need to. Last time, the excuse was that the Fed didn't give very much indication that they were going to slow down asset purchasing. Now, the Fed has been lying about inflation and making everyone seem relaxed at inflation numbers. If they do become very doveish as a result of these numbers, I don't know how investors will move after they're given a rude awakening that this inflation isn't transitory.

So, we have a ~$310B default from Evergrande and potentially less asset purchasing from the Fed.
Yep, all signs are pointing towards the downside…at least for most typical equities and tech

Frankly I still can’t believe people haven’t realized this inflation is not only not transitory but on a scale unlike anything we have ever seen in history. Once people begin to realize this, god only knows how the market will react.
It’s a game.  Never a clear reason for anything because there is no reason.
AAPL always shits the bed at earnings. 

By and large a lot of companies tank after earnings because people are trading on the run up and selling on the earnings. 

It happens across the board.
Not nearly to this degree. It seems like every other company is tanking by double digits if not 20%+ 

I haven’t seen anything like this in the 5 years I’ve been actively trading

You didn't sell up 80% Tf?
Declaring bankruptcy is for his own good. Greed is strong on this one

Looks like it bounced off of a support with SPY doing the same. 80%?

TSLA bulls better hope elon posts that form 4 tonight or this pos is getting nuked again tomorrow
It's literally hanging on by a thread, I cannot believe people buy tsla at these prices
Can tesla break out to upper 1100s
Short TSLA, CAR.
Welp my AFRM leaps are now $20+ ITM

Feels good
Literally every company crashes and burns after reporting earnings but SPY is within 1% of ATH.
Good wish, giving my puts some hope
at what price is WISH a pennystock, lol
[Serious] So... I'm in this really weird situation where some random user on reddit has gone through my comment history saying useless, mean, and mostly very insulting comments all over my post history? See for yourself.. but like.. wtf? and what should I do?
just report the guy in all the comments
Pity them
ignore him. If you block him his comments become invisible to you.
Fuck those people. Live your best life.  See you behind the 7-11.
Tell your dad to stop
You can literally block people. I kind of want to reply to your oldest comment now, but that seems like a lot of scrolling.
This is the internet why do you even fucking care 🤣 you think anyone is going to look at your old posts or karma or whatever bullshit you’re caring about lol 😂
I don’t see any replies to your recent comments, so is this like a self-referential thing?
I blocked and reported the user after they spammed all the way down my comment history with violent and rude shit.
I really decided to buy wish calls. Im fuckin retarded lmaoo

My puts feel sad for tomorrow
Tomorrow SPY will rally just as the great pumpkin will rise from the pumpkin patch
Close all my fucking positions and buy in at at the bottom of the dip. Evergrande 300B default will destroy everything in the way.
When are their payments due?
Bro they defaulted
Are people literally incapable of doing their own research anymore? They were expected to default on 1 creditor but made the minimum interest payment on their bonds avoiding the 11/10th grace period expiration.
You believe the inevitable default everyone has known about since August will destroy the entire market based on a debt price tag that is smaller than TSLA’s market cap gains in the same period?
TSLA bullish sentiment? I will once again inverse WSB and buy puts in the morning

I went vegan 3 years ago and i go clean wipe 75% of the time.
I was vegan for a few years. Felt great. I got tingling, numbness in hands and didn’t feel well. I feel better now, eating meat and dairy. What’s weird is it’s like my allergens went away? I seem to digest better now. Maybe healing? Idk, I’m a type of guy that is strong with no training. Kinda like “farmer build” naturally. Idk if some bodies just can’t do it long term? Some animal fats seem to be integral to brain health long term. Anyways, glad it’s still working for you.
Fucked around and bought TSLA after hours. Unfortunate options are not traded during these hours

so Musk did sell his shares already, and executed his options. well, that explains a lot.
Looks like he sold 10% of the 10% he said he would sell on Monday. So probably 30% so far. (10% a day)
after the shit show that was the last few days, hoping he understands to do it in smaller blocks.
#AFFIRM 1 DAY OUT CALLS WILL 10X EASY TOMORROW
Do you mean if you bought eod today or if you buy tomorrow?
+5% Nasdaq tomorrow. Everyone loves red, white and blue and that’s why tomorrow is green.
What the frick! I swear I thought I was paper trading!
He sold buy it.
walk me through why the fuck I should buy
Because people dont realize its value yet. Everyone screaming its overpriced makes it early days.
He just sold some of it that has to bring it down a little bit I believe it will go up but this is more of a long timed out investment
Well that might be smart too i dont know the future. All i know is that people are still confused and thats a good time for me.
Im selling my SOFI calls at open
Good, you in profit?
Yeah I’ve had January calls for a couple months now but they got beat to shit today. I’ll dump them tomorrow
Nice. Rare to see someone here making money
So I heard Elon sold his shares, does that mean my TSLA calls will print now right?
if you time them right
Bwaaaahahaha Bwaaaahahaha BWAAAAHAHAHA

You guys ready for another day of SPY moving between 462 and 467?
Yeah sure
Why’d I get downvoted?? Because I’m not a blind bull who thinks stocks only go up?
Probably,  I agree with you I think we drop down to 62
oh… this week is a wash. Looking at a few charts I think Monday has the potential to be a breakout day for SPY. Possibly into that $475 range everyone’s been hoping for
I could see that, I think you’re right about this week for sure tho

Buy cans of Arizona iced tea, wrap them to look like beer cans, sell them to homeless people and run away before they realize
Only thing I can tell you is that there are a number of options which do that on a daily basis, particularly index options.

The trick is to find them.
Index options? Aren't those extremely expensive
Not the ETF options. (SPY, QQQ, IWM and the like)
Ahhh you mean those. Yeah I mean honestly for spy I could have made 600% but I was a paperhand little bitch. But of course I was comfortable holding onto prog calls which I pretty much knew was a pump n dump nonsense. Sigh. Got any spy puts or calls you looking at lmao?
Not investment advice, but right now, I'm thinking that probably buy a 0.5% to 1% OTM Put/Call SPY straddle on Friday, but I have no way of knowing if either one is safe so never gamble more than you are comfortable losing.
Take a quarter, put a string on it, insert it into a drink machine 5 times and get yourself a sodie pop or a green tea. Works like 15% of the time.

Algos frantically buying TSLA thinking this was the big share sale.  This is 1/16th of the amount he said he'd sell.
What do you think happened yesterday?
They have to disclose sales…he only sold 1 billion as of today.

Everything is priced in.   Even that stupid hat you keep wearing.
Futures nice and green Spy calls going to print right at the open
And then pump, then die violently while I'm grilling. Again. Fuck.
Way too early for green to mean anything
Wonder if TSLA will dump tomorrow once people realize Elon still hasn't sold his 10% and Mondays sell only covers 1%  knowing TSLA it will probably just print anyways
Or he was never going to sell 10% and he’s just a troll. This is a common tactic of conmen to create a highly negative narrative and then when it’s only slightly negative sentiment quickly surges higher.
Sale priced in now. And Elon is exercising options and buying more.
How do you know Elon is exercising options ?
It’s been reported in several articles

I was only nine years old. I loved Shrek so much, I had all the merchandise and movies. I'd pray to Shrek every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I've been given. "Shrek is love", I would say, "Shrek is life". My dad hears me and calls me a ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5958). I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Shrek. I called him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It's Shrek. I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear, "This is my swamp". He grabs me with his powerful ogre hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Shrek. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Shrek. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Shrek. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in. Shrek looks him straight in the eye, and says, "It's all ogre now". Shrek leaves through my window. Shrek is love. Shrek is life.﻿

The average temperature of the human rectum is 114 degrees Fahrenheit. That is warm enough to cook an egg.
Boiled or fried?
Runny.
Parents would be freaking out if their baby had a rectal temp of 114°
Why didn’t I buy more Tesla, NVIDIA and PLTR after the dump the last 2 days? Guess I’ll remain poor for the rest of my miserable life.

Um shouldn't this be illegal:. Among those insider sales, Kimbal Musk’s was the only transaction that was not listed as a 10b5, or planned sale. Kimbal Musk sold around $109 million worth of his shares a day ahead of his brother’s Twitter poll.
Yeah call the cops pussy.

Bumble might be the worst app I've ever used. I've gotten literally zero dates from it. Seeing them tank horribly brings joy to my petty heart.
You probably just ugly homie.
It's not me it's the app that's the problem 

🤡
tinder is 10x worse. Mostly just onlyfans profiles or influencers trying to get more followers. Any actual girl there in good faith is either obese or trans
Trans? Go on. 🤔
You can't a get a date on the app where women pick the men?  Imagine that.
Why do u actually go on dates just get tinder to fuck
Well the women have to initiate the contact, so I’m guessing you’re fugly.
Bumble is super easy to get dates from, you’re probably just super uninteresting with completely unreasonable standards. Being ugly isn’t even an excuse, dude I know has a hairline like a friar, adult acne and a neckbeard and he’s with some chubby 5 who treats him pretty good.
Truth is a bitter pill
What are you on about? I cleaned up on bumble. Best app bar none
Tomorrow morning. We eat puts.
We fuck da 🏳️‍🌈 🐻
Everything rally tomorrow 🚀

Those are 9’s, 10’s are just 9’s you can trick.
10 is pretty young bro
The only ex I ever had who was a straight up ten offed herself because her husband came out of the closet, she was legit crazy and apparently crazy enough to turn this dude 🌈 . A lot of hot chicks are crazy in my experience.

Wait what how can someone turn someone gay? Isn’t the dude gay already to begin with?
I have no idea tbh I didn’t know the guy. I just know the details of the death.

Yep and she was 9 years younger than me. I tried to hit it every time we hung out and when she dumped me I offered her fwb and she was down until she realized I was just using her for sex. Like how would I ever keep a 9. Long story short she kept my kid because I like a true day trader I don’t pull out and condoms are for suckers.

I kind of hope they miss a little so I can pick some up at discount
it was at a discount a week ago. It was lower than its January lows.
Yeah I sold a put back then
I need a cigarette. 🥵
Literally the first time in a long time I don't go 🌈🐻 the market decides to shit itself. I literally can't win, Holy fuck.
Right there with you bro. Not three days after I decided to stop buying puts, lmao
Cash gang for now, then loading up on OTM puts on the next run up.
If we pump in the morning again and then start to look shaky I’m 100% getting in to 1dte 460p tomorrow

Only 56%? Look at Mr. Money-Bags over here!

Bynd now down 20%
I bought 100 calls on affirm before closing 👑

Well thats that. Wish is gonna moon tomorrow. Think I'm done trying to pick earnings. Even dead companies revive when I pick em lol

Uh, maybe with Iger but the new CEO is a complete asshat 😂 I fucked with the mouse and bought puts right before close and I’m printing tomorrow
I’m happy for you . I’ve a friend high up in Disney and it’s a ruthless POS. The board are insane. She’s been at meetings where they have sniper teams on the roof. Just remember the mouse never forgets lmao 🤣
The mouse didn’t hear no bell.
All in on spy puts expiring Friday.  I’ll see you guys when I see you
NVDA rebound to $300 tomorrow a.m., book it
Please god…
don't need a crystal ball to tell you disney+ is plateauing

most of their initial subscriber growth was because they were practically giving it away when it launched, like 1 year free from verizon or something

also probably the biggest issue: there's nothing to watch


maybe if you are a giant star wars fan the content is palatable since they seem to be creating a new star wars show every season, but that's it
They have promise though. Just that mngmt kinda dumb. They rely on the old classics and nothing new and decent
Clearly you guys dont have kids.  Having puppy dog pals on demand at all times is the best
That is true but that won't attract new subscribers. Everyone who want that already there. It's just an archive now
1. Subscribe to Disney+
2. Watch latest season of the Baby Yoda show
3. Unsubscribe until next season of the Baby Yoda show comes out
I swear if I would've picked Beyond Meat or Disney that shit would have shot up. Fucking WISH. You'd think that would've been a safe bet to fall. Course not lol.
Inflation schlamation. Boys, Jpow has our and the market's back. We'll be good in a few weeks. Stay the course.
Well Ford, you disappoint me
Yeah I mean wtf
Rivian gains mean nothing I suppose, over 1,000% return for them is bad for business
Lol
I think selling too early and missing out on crazy gains hurts more than a loss tbh
thanks Biden
Ugh come on ford get back to 20 I beg you on my hands and knees
my SPY calls for 12/31 have decreased by 74% lol rip, shit better run soon
I just bought a handful of $500c 12/31 today ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
I bought some yesterday, they're worth a lot less today
Buy more and get that cost average down ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
My 11/24 477c are down 55%

I still think they print.
Oof
Why?

Ive still got 2 weeks for them to print.
I think they'll get pounded tomorrow and Friday.
Well here's to hoping you're wrong for my sake!
525c 12/31, bought for $0.1, have a sell at $0.2 so all I need is a run and I'll be happy
Better hope evergrande don’t default then or your fucked buddy boy
They didn’t
didn't evergrande officially default?
No check the news
I'm seeing both, some sources are saying they avoided default and others saying they defaulted

What a Shameless act by HedgeFunds and big institutions...  they first give the good rating and just after good earnings and good guidance they again give it a bad rating to bring the prove down. Sick and tired of it... they pulled the price down from
27$ to 22$, and that's so sketchy. And the Algos create panic and stop loss selling kicks in... how long we retail Investors keep Loosing all our life savings??? Is there any end to it?
Still sticking with $PLTR and hoping that 8 million strong wsb retail investors continue holding / buying pltr and bring it back to its reasonable 30$ level...

🚀🚀🚀
What was your stop loss set at?
lmao imagine thinking pltr was ever going to go above 24 and stay there
I love this whole idea that someone makes a bad pick and then it’s “the evil institutions” that did it. Shouldn’t have held that sketchy stock through earnings. It would be sad if one didn’t learn a lesson from this.

How is TSLA moving like this?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
Filing showed Elon sold shares already
He sold 1/10th of the 10% he’s expected to sell, not out of the woods yet
The shares of common stock were sold solely to satisfy the reporting person’s tax withholding obligations related to the exercise of stock options to purchase 2,154,572 shares. So he fulfilled his tax obligation. Who says he’s selling the rest any time soon? I bet he wants to keep his shares.
He’s still on the hook for $15B+ in taxes due next April, unless he’s gonna borrow the rest and go against what he tweeted, highly doubt that a $2B sale this week is all that’s going through
he sold 40% yesterday, 60% today
Where do you see this? I’m only seeing 2.1M shares sold, he’s got another 17M shares left to sell
you are right
Lord Edge has about 170 million shares. He'll be selling for awhile to get to the 10% sale.
This could all be a mind fuck. TSLA flat tomorrow confirmed
"Tesla driver killed in fiery crash was going 90mph, NTSB report says."

TSLA 1500 eow confirmed
Ouch As many Tesla’s are in road as BMW 2019-21. Yet latter has recorded so few fatalities, lol @ Elon claim they are safe
Different audiences imo.  BMW is all rich folks, while Tesla is half that, half kids that YOLO'd into Tesla and made a few bucks to buy the car then treat it like its a race car.

One of these groups is more likely to YOLO into a wreck.

you just define my life and its scary,
Get FUCKED $DIS.
You know the kind of video I'm talking about.  You click on the link to the "girl gags on 12" dick" thinking that's something I've never seen before.  Sounds kinda hot.  Into it at first, cute girl is enthusiastic.  But after awhile she starts to change.  Tears running down her face, mascara running, has stopped wiping the slobber from her chin.  You can't tell if she's enjoying it anymore.  It does seem like she's gotten used to it though.

Tesla fan boys, in the example above, you're what used to be the cute girl.  In the beginning it may have been fun, but Musk publicly announcing on Twitter that he was going to sell is the equivalence of grabbing the back of your head, while you were going down on him.  

Seems like you are doing your best to make sure you swallow the whole fucking choad. So, your mascara is running, you've got goo running down your chin, and you've taken maybe 20% of his load. 

  
And in the end, you're going to force a smile.  


Hope you get paid.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
but you're missing the part where she gets a huge payday
I'm a massive degenerate you forgot the part where she ends up vomiting on the cock - dickdrainers, blackpayback and facialabuse do this kind of shit.
Dude why did I have to read this.
Oh fuck.  I have a hard enough time getting through the gag and spit it back on the dick and go back for more.  But, it certainly works better for the analogy of the Tesla fan boys to keep coming back for more.
When you watch porn, how aware are you that it’s fake. Idk why, but I’ve never been able to get passed the acting. Its just weird to think that there are people out there that just see it differently. Kind of wish I was like them. I wish that I could make myself believe it was real, I bet it would be more enjoyable.
Idk bro I just like tits and stuff.

Just like I don't care that the waitress is totally being fake nice.
Good example. I’d rather the waitress be blunt and honest 🤷‍♂️
Id rather it too.  But thats why porn and intimacy are entirely different to my soul, and pp
Fair take
everything on the video box is fake, and most people in real life too. So, if most of it is fake doesn't it make it defacto real?
> I don't think so.
Idk… when you know neither actor is actually getting any pleasure and there’s no connection it just becomes two people putting a peg in a hole repeatedly. There’s now power dynamic, there’s no vulnerability, there’s no fun, there’s no humanity.
I've seen enough to think I can tell the difference between a fake "gnnghh, gnnghh, gnnghh" and a real one.    


But there are the little involuntary twitches that actresses make when it becomes a little too real for them and they're "asking" to get the dick out of their throat.  Either that, or they are Oscar worthy.
“Gnnghh gnnghh gnnghh” that got me good 😂


It’s all fake though, unless it’s some real amateur stuff. Listen to any podcast with a pornstar, they feel nothing, they can do hundreds of shoots and not once get turned on. Most of these dudes dicks are desensitized too, it’s a huge problem. Even when they cum, it’s more about relaxing muscles in order to force it because they’ve practiced holding it back for so long. It’s all as real as any other movie.
It may be time to bring back a WSB classic...  JNUG!

People here who are saying high inflation means higher stocks don’t understand what inflation actually means for business.
Inflation is transitory didn’t you hear?
You will find we collectively don’t know much
It depends greatly on individual sectors elasticity of demand

Evidently not if we end up going bigly green.
since when does business have anything to do with the price of stocks?

Bear*
What happens every month after inflation data is reported:

1) Market initially gets spooked: bond yields jump; stocks sell off.

2) Over the next few days/weeks, other news & economic data come in. Wall Street investors forget about the high inflation numbers.

3) With investors’ short attention spans having moved on to other things, Federal Reserve officials go back to their usual talking points about inflation being “transitory,” and how they’re in no hurry to take policy action.

4) Bond yields fall; stocks continue rally.

5) Rinse and repeat every month.

Wall Street cares about interest rates, not inflation. This is why “S&P returns vs. inflation rates” historical analyses are pointless, because the Federal Reserve actually cared about inflation back then.
You wrote that shit like an email
They think every time we get bad inflation numbers the Fed will finally say "Ok ok, enough is enough time to fucking raise the rates", and then they just don't and say it's NBD.
There’s just no political pressure on them to do so.

The Democrats need QE and ZIRP to monetize their spending.

Everyone in Congress is getting rich off skyrocketing stock prices & home values.
Wallstreet very much cares about inflation you autist.
terrible analysis. Terrible
TSLA means risk back on.
TLT dumping means rotation back to stocks. 
QQQ violent bounce off 388 means bottom could be in.

Look at the last 2 times TLT dumped hard
I’m with him
TLT was dumping all day, and started recovering along with stocks.

Ive got 10 11/12 $4.5p, should I sell at open or go full R to Friday?
I'm taking profits on my 5p 11/12s at open. Don't get greedy
That's usually my problem lol.
take em at open and move on to the next one. Don't fall in love with trades
True enough. At least I'm thinking this should cover my previous bad bets on plug/pltr.
Check out Chinese news
What, that Evergrande paid their loans at the last minute? https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/business/evergrande-bond-deadline.amp.html
source?? so many fake ass chinese outlets
[deleted]
Assuming Evergrande or something relating to the mess their country's real estate is currently in.
thought they made some payment today to avoid the continuing snow ball.
Yes that what I am talking about, the fed is warning that it will spill over. I’m going to start to bet against their market. The owner is floating the money for them but it can’t last
Holy cow. If tsla hits 1200 tomorrow I’d make 7k lol
Everyone happy that TSLA mooning tomorrow only tells me it will sell off and go red.
Gut tells me a Bull trap for retail.... Who'll be left holding the bag. Just a gut feeling. Not playing tsla
Happy to hold Tesla
Ya this is just some AH bullshit.
Not sure how anyone trusts this stock anymore.  Especially when Elon just pulled some shady actions on his stock sales   Pre-registered, then schedules sale for 11-8 but decides to throw a tweet ahead of it on the weekend?   The guy is crazy.  He might be smart with technology but his reckless behavior when it comes to managing his money and company is going to screw over anyone following him blindly.
Just took my covid booster. Sounds like a day off tomorrow boys
3 days cos you had a terrible reaction lmao
Smart dude. 


I’m always “sick” after my flu shot any year I take it. 


Its a free sick day. Your shot documentation is basically the doctors note 👍🏾
Calls on myocarditis
Cuck
Why you calling yourself?
i'm getting mine tomorrow and i've adjusted nothing. weak ass vaccine gotta get it every couple months. it's got nothing on me. 😂
I mean you don’t have to be sick to call a day off due to vaccine..
the only time i can remembering calling out of anything because 'sick' was when i had emergency plastic surgery at 4:30 am and i was still there by 12:30 with my eye all sewn shut like a god damn professional.

SPY puts.
Wondering how a company that makes two pretty ugly expensive trucks is worth a 100 billion.
$100 is too much. $20 and I would have jumped in.
I hope you loaded up on tesla 1200 calls. We bounced off support.

I'm out of shredded cheese and I made this dank chicken chili so instead of sprinkling cheese on top I'm layering slices of muenster cheese like

Muenster 

Hot chili

Muenster 

Hot chili

Muenster 

Hot chili

And it is so good wow
Muenster is an underrated cheese. When I use it I hum the theme song.
For real that sounds amazing, Muenster is the best
Elite tier cheese
It's probably even better because the muenster cheese will melt amazingly
Exactly I don't think there is a cheese that melts better than muenster 

It is messy af trying to eat it though it's like eating pasta if the pasta was melty cheese
Sneaky feeling red tomorrow again
Agree. I think we are sideways or down for the rest of the week. Then bigly green the middle of next week.
Yeah next week green for sure. Maybe even Friday. I doubt tomorrow though. Honestly I’d rather get cheap calls anyway
Green day tmrw?
Everything faking rally 🚀
head fake probably. 9:30 pump and then suddenly at 11:00AM like clockwork.... BULLTARPS
Thats good enough for me....enough time for me to unload these 10 fd calls i bought yesterday fml
Over for bul
Those red candles are spooky
The bears were sooooo annoying this morning my god. I just had to step away from wsb for a while
They’re about to get ass fucked tomorrow. Sad part is they’ll probably enjoy it.
if AMD goes more down tomorrow I'm going to kill my pet fly
Noooo 😭
I WILL DO IT, IM FUCKING CRAZY
bulls are basically the wehrmacht in 1941. enjoying an uninterrupted string of spectacular victories stretching back years. bears are the soviets, desperate and demoralized, routed at every turn, giving out machine gun hand jobs to finance SPY puts

and TSLA is our stalingrad 🐻
Mods, please make my flair 'machine gun hand jobs'
SNDL earnings tomorrow after market. Significant acquisitions made in the last Q and no current debt. Earnings expectations are high and as long as the whole market doesn't take a beating today I expect a nice run. Stock dropped 6% so it looks like the scared money got out. 

The stock has until Feb to get back above a dollar before delisting so the coming days could be the pump SNDL needs to stay alive as the company continues to expand.
Do you think WSB and daytraders will combine their powers to ensure a SNDL rally above $0.99 on january 31??
It's going above $1.00 with or without you guys.

Institutional buyers make so much money off this stock, they always buy in and pump it above $1.00 before expiration.
do you have $1 calls on SNDL expiring after jan 30?

&#x200B;

I mean wouldn't it make alot of sense to have these?
I've got the 1/21/22 calls, 420 of 'em.

It's absolutely going above $1.00, no doubt whatsoever.

More than likely it's going above $2.00 due to the massive open interest on those calls.
Who else thinks LCID up 6% before open? 🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐

#WHO BOUGHT PUTS AT THE BOTTOM? SHOW YOURSELF!
🙋‍♂️
The bottom *so far*
Bottom?. Hold on to something!
I love TSLA and have gone on about why I think it can keep going up, however, Elon is going to sell so many shares a day before tax season that we ride -10% days into oblivion
Yes
elon is just going to market sell 15 million shares on RH at open tomorrow
TSLA $1 limits buys it is
TESLA 1093$ GERMANY! Bears r fukdddd
1 elon block will dump this thing 90$ in 5 minutes
I got a put as hedge dingus. Make money both ways. But I know it’ll touch 1100+
Eh time for calls is tail end of next week I think
Elon just sold, pump it!
Just saw this. Some articles saying $1.5B others say $5B. Either way, looks like a red day today.
Just found out my dog likely has cancer.
Sorry to hear my man - its tough, not gonna lie. Take care of 'em as much as you can but don't let 'em go through too much pain.
Get a good send off meal sooner than later.
Sucks man, hope you're ok
Ahh fuck.

I had a cat who had kidney failure, the only advice I can give you, don't hang on to them for too long, they can't tell you they're in pain and we're often bad at spotting the signs they're in pain.
That’s fucked. Keep your head up and stay strong
sorry to hear man, hope you can save the pup
Hope he gets better but puts on dog

That’s good, so his traits include being nurturing, sensitive, compassionate, self-protective, security-seeking and offering, loving, and displaying a goofy, ingratiating sense of humor.

futures fake pump?
If we get SP500 futures over .5% I think it’s likely it’s not fake. RIP me then
China is up over 2%. We're definitely green today.
The smalldickclub seems to be awfully quiet these days. Selfish pricks won't even share that loss porn
This feels like 2008 all over again. HFs and the Fed keep stacking the house of cards and kicking the can down the road. Supply chain fucked, inflation fucked, but here we are still sailing along. It would be better if they just addressed this shit now, have a healthy correction and move forward. But greedy gonna greedy, so we won’t address it until the house of cards falls and the economy is fucked again. With that out of the way, SPY ATH tomorrow
They can't risk a correction without a full meltdown. Banks, everyone and his dog is leveraged to the tits.
Yeah they already know what’s on the other side of this and every day they don’t act it’s just makes the bomb bigger. We learned nothing from 2008 except that HFs literally could care less until they **absolutely have to**, and even then it’s just a marginal fuck. Coupling a complete market collapse on the heels of a pandemic is doomsday, and they know that.
buy puts pussy
No way of knowing what/when the catalyst that triggers the collapse will be. I’ll ride market trends, but just pointing out that this is built on a pile of shit right now.
The VP then is the P now. Same cast of characters fucking you over. Don’t be surprised.
Lol remember when the covid deaths were racking up and they closed everything… and stocks going through the roof with worse and worse news? Wait it’s still happening! Lol tempted to keep more and more cash on hand every month
Time to take this country back. 

Boomer pussies sat back and watched this country get sold out to the highest bidder for decades and now their children are staring down the barrel of a desolate future.

Fucking done with this shit I'm bringing out the pitchforks. My generation will do what yours was too afraid to
you aint doing shit boy sit tf down
Seems like we’re off to a good start…
Down 1.5% from highs and the pitchforks are already out.   This will be a very pleasant winter.
If you’re holding bags, I feel bad for you son. I got 99 problems but AMC ain’t one.

r/antiwork is full of min wage cucks who blame billionaires for their problems and take no personal responsibilities to better themselves. How hard is it to buy GME and trade SPY weeklies??
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Tell me you have had a bad trading week without telling me you had a bad trading week.
I think it's allot simpler than that. They may just be 'anti-work'. I know a bum at the 7 eleven down the street that is super anti work.
Today sucked ass, and not in a good way!
So we should blame tesla that we didn't have a healthy market correction and can't grow now
I. . . I just tried to eat and it fell right out of my asshole onto the floor when I swallowed. . . I, I. . . 💀
It was not until I advanced on SPY with calls pointed at it's head that it shot me.
We'll be at ATHs again next week tbh
Alright SOFI

Realized +$500 unrealized loss of $1600. 

Sooo, pretty good I guess
I was up 40% on the month on Friday, now down to only up 3%. Not a great day
Most my short term plays were good ,  but my portfolio got fucked because AAPL, MSFT and TSM are my main holdings. 

I’m not too worried about those, though, they will come back.
Went from 10k unrealized gains to $300 unrealized gains.
Do not get fooled by Wish. Tommorow we are either going down or up bigly.
Damn it, it's always the same 2 direction with that stock! Why can't it just move in a clockwise motion?

BYND is a cool product, but it needs to taste better.  maybe stop focussing on a meat flavor, and focus on "tastes good."
Also they should call it Beyond Profits.
Tastes just like real profits
Unhealthier version of saltier dryer meat
This. Vegetarian stuff can taste great without tasting like meat. 

Morningstar products are good as fuck—because they just taste good, not because they’re trying to taste like meat.
Then it's no better than corn syrup, worse since it's made in a lab moreso.
Here's a secret guys, buy calls a week before earnings.
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Apprehensive_Ad_1765 (0/2) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1300.0 when it was 1214.51 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
RIP BYND. You were the first meme stock I gambled on. Blew up my account thinking you’d make it past 250 you piece of shit

Wheel of Fortune can kiss my ass. The minimum any contestant can win for just being on the show is 1000$. The amount a contestant wins for solving the first puzzle is 1000$. So what they are saying is that a person who solves no puzzles is equal to a person who solves one puzzle. It’s trashy if you ask me. That first puzzle needs to be worth 1500$ minimum. I’m sick of this shit.
Do you get offended by being mis-gendered?
Careful. You’re talking shit about a sensitive subject.
Ya know I may have decreased my bloodlines total wealth by about 63% within a matter of minutes on tesla calls these last few days, but at least I know that money probably went directly into Elon Musks bank account ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270) let’s go to mars baby
If the apes put even half as much thought into DDs for good stocks instead of GME, they'd actually be worth reading.
The thing about their DD is that they start with an assumption and then draw wild conclusions to support it.

Got some RIG today
So does the sec filing mean Elon has sold the shares he said was going to already?
he sold a tiny fraction and will be selling for a while
You hope.
no, this is the overwhelming likelihood, unless he sold 2M one day and then 20M the next, which is absurd and not reflected in the tape at all
The tape that showed 60M volume?
Uhhh yes? do you think 20M of the 60M was one guy selling huge blocks?
> No, I think that it was one guy selling huge blocks.
Foh vm
I doubt he sold it all yesterday. Id guess based on last years offering he is mostly done tho. But yes its possible on that print to do 20M.
Lol. It is not
Or… OR…. Business decisions made it September aren’t actually dictated by fucking Twitter polls in November and are, you know, open to interpretation. 

I do love that you guys are so sold now on the religion that absolutely 10% of all his shares MUST now be sold. 

That it couldn’t end up being 10% of his options. That it couldn’t end up being a poll to prepare the market for expected moves. That it couldn’t possibly ever be anything BUT, Elon musk is about to intentionally tank his share price completely, and in short order, because the Twitter poll said so.   

Let me know how those puts are doing next week. 

If you haven’t gone back into your cave for the winter.
he sold monday.
No he sold like 1/20th of what he needs
He sold something. Not sure what
I thought everyone was woke and on that climate change train. Why we worried about oil prices spiking?
Whoever is worried doesnt realize Russia and the Saudis could just turn on the taps at any time. Its an artificial shortage. They want US producers to start pouring money into the Permian then when they turn on the taps and send oil down to sub 30 those US producers go BK.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
The US producers know better this time, though. Would be a good bit if Joe forces them to produce more.
because we’re not set up to go oil free yet? are you actually dumb
Because supply chains run on oil and that means everything will cost more?

I've been here since just before the COVID crash and am up 800% all time. It took me a while but I figured out what I'm doing.

I give dogshit advice though.
Current holdings?
Other than cash, mostly short-dated plays. I play a lot of earnings based upon stuff I hear or observe and tend to get them right. For longer-ish term stuff, I recently bought some game store on the chance that they announce a good steam alternative with digital used game sales like Cohen said in his letter ages ago and the rumored tech could now make possible, though I don't believe the conspiracy theory of the apes. I also have a TDOC LEAPS because of the DD that got posted here a while ago. Other than that I have a few SPXS and VIX calls that I opened this morning. I'm mostly cash at the moment. I think we're due for a pullback. I recently transitioned my IRA (which I usually take a fuckton of risk with) from SPY LEAPS to super defensive value/dividend stocks. Though this defensiveness isn't expecting a huge drop. I'll go pretty deep into SPY LEAPS once we have a 5%-ish drop.
I agree with you on the pullback. I think I’ll do the same with spy calls when it happens

Anyone here ever shart on a first date, right after walking into the restaurant while talking to the hostess?  Haha, yea me neither
nah I almost shit my pants after a first date. Pulled over on one side of an 8 lane highway, type road 4 one way 4 the other, and just shouted "be right back" before sprinting across the road to the only open place, an exxon. Mind you, my asshole is in DEFCON 1 mode with tonight's meal at the gates. I burst through the doors, called for the bathroom, sprinted into it and found the most horrific scene in a bathroom I've encountered to date. Empty natty ice everywhere, pepperonis, some sort of drug paraphernalia, blood, a single shoe, blood, shit, and piss, was everywhere.   


I had no choice. *IT WAS A FIRE FIGHT!* The sheer force of my asshole exploding as I squatted the eagles perch on the seat's edge caused me to lean forward and my uncontrollable bowels exploded in a volley similar to a fighter jet destroying a target. "*Fox 1! Fox 2!"* my asshole said, as it blasted watery poo everywhere behind me.

Hello, my name is Puneet Dikshit.

These days, I look for beauty in the little things. The song of blue birds nesting in my hedges, the mournful meow of a hungry cat, the smell of my freshly mowed lawn. Sometimes I’ll lay in the grass and stare up at the clouds for hours, letting the ants crawl upon my pale skin. In the evening, I’ll walk barefoot through my garden, and jerk off amongst the flowers, passing my seed on to them.

Imagine paper handing your tesla calls at the bottom today, thinking itll continue to crash. You then buy puts for it, only for it to rocket back up... lmaoooo

I should've know regardless of earnings, WISH wasn't just going to become a penny stock overnight. Was worth a shot though.
What the fuck happened AH? My puts were doing great then there was a huge spike.
Tomorrow? There's going to be a tomorrow?

I really thought DIS would do well.  I was wrong.
What is going on with Affirm. Seriously.
People worried it would be an UPST redo (when it reports).  So it tanked during the day.  Then it reported...
I want to believe, SOFI, but you’ve hurt me so much
Should have put more on BYND puts.
I had 5 80$ Nov 19 puts. Should have had more.
Took the same but weeklies. Needed a win. So happy 😌 high five.
BYND missed estimates. More like analysts over estimated and got their numbers wrong.
They lowered estimates before earnings. Wasn't that a huge sign for lowering Q4 guidance. BYND puts was free money today.
SoFi damn near gave me an aneurysm today only to go back to where it started the day AH. To think that I get to do this shit every quarter - holy shit. Listening to the earnings call at 5pm. Anthony Noto is your dad.
Buy OPAD before it’s $10 tomorrow
Shit's at 1x revenue while being a high growth company. Makes no fucking sense.

My plan is to look at my gains on OPEN.

I spent some money on the dip, right before close. Now I realise that I probably could have sold all my bags to go all in on on it, cover my losses, make profit and still deduct all my loss from my taxes. I regret not trying that. Oh well... maybe next time.

Affirm has finally reached the point like my girlfriend, officially stopped the teasing and went straight to the deepthroat with 170 price passage 😩
Today I opened a SOFI 20P 12/17 for 2.15 and shorted the 21P expiring this week for 2.00. How could I lose anything on this play? I saw that no matter which way the stock moved it was going to be a win-win situation. I can now just sell puts for the next 4 weeks with my long put as collateral
> How could I lose anything on this play? 

If SOFI closes below $20 on Friday, the holder of the 21P you sold is gonna make you buy 100 shares at $21, which you can then force the guy you bought the 20P from to buy at $20, so you will take a loss of $1. Not only that, but it cost you $.15 to open the trade, so you just lost $1.15
The 21p would still have a ton of extrinsic.  He’d just cover the short assignment and sell the 21p
If he can afford the assignment that would be a viable way to manage the trade but will still result in a net loss.
> > You are an idiot.
If SOFI drills to 15 or so, the intrinsic of the short option would outpace the intrinsic + extrinsic of the long.

What happened to RIOT
Riots
It sold off with almost everything else today?
Seemed rather steep but I really wasnt paying attention to news
Thoughts on EVGO?
EVGO is worth holding imo
I bought at $9 2000 shares on leverage. cashed out at $16. Was watching it for the whole year. Got too cheap to ignore. It’s had an absolutely belting fortnight 👍 🚀
Do you think it’ll break 20
I honestly do yeh. But I sold because I would expect a correction maybe first? But I love that stock, the company is everything you need for a carbon neutral future (which is the way of the next 5-10 years). They have the largest fast charging network in the US, partnered with GM, include Tesla plugs at all their stations. The charging infrastructure of EV is lagging so far behind the demand and vehicle production levels that there has the be huge growth in the future and as far as I’m concerned they are positioned perfectly to grow into it. It’s a big yes from me. 
It’s been the best play I’ve made all year 👍 future is green IMO
Expect >20 in 2022

tesla day trades were juicy but someone set the game to the hardest setting there is today, zero room for error, fast action, uno reverse card, it was some next level stuff trying to trade on a day like this i don't even know how i survived it, basically had to opposite bet myself then take profits, opposite bet that position take profits, and opposite bet that and swing it, who know where its going to open at in the morning

sold a 285/280 nvda put credit spread for nov12. how fuk am i?
I’d hold unless it breaks 290
oo ok i guess. im shitting myself not gonna lie
I feel you man it’s sketchy when you got a chunk of collateral completely at risk. What’s the breakeven on your short leg
my breakeven is 284.49. dude i literally cant even summon the enthusiam needed to rub one out at the moment. 

edit: oh i misread i thought you meant the position. the breakeven on teh short let is283.8
Lmao I feel you bro I got 1500 collateral on a spread where the short legs already itm but it’s mind over matter man especially in this situation where 290 could be support and you can make some credits back. I’d make 290 the ultimatum but that’s just my risk tolerance and I got leaps in nvda so I’m already hoping it bounces off 290 lmao
Can someone teach me bonds, how the 11-April-2022 Evergrande's bond has over 3200% Yield to Maturity. There's one last bond payment left anymore (Yes, you guessed right, 11th of April). Assuming they'll keep getting money from somewhere and they keep paying their bonds (which some sources say they're not doing, and some say they're paying), wouldn't it be smart to buy bonds maturing soon, so the likelihood of getting the bond coupon payments would be relatively high?

I'm sure I just don't understand Yield to Maturity correctly on bonds that are basically going to mature on their next (and last payment), but please tell me what I'm missing here.
They aren’t making payments?
Is this a question or answer with a fact to my hypothetical scenario where it is assumed that they would pay the bonds.
This is an answer, posed as a question…

The whole reason they’re in the news is because they are missing bond interest payments.  These payments are generally around $100 mil or so.  The bond capital returns that are on the books for March and April are 10-20x that. 

The yield-to-maturity calculation is complex but it assumes everything goes as scheduled.  That 3200% might assume that missed back payments are also factored in.
Hmm, yeah that would make sense I guess, but if they have not paid the last bond payment on October, then I would assume the bond value would be closer to zero?

Gotta do some research on the weekend to figure out junk bonds.
No the more I think about it the more this seems like a true WSB play.  Either it’s a massive global crash or you realize your yield… I think it comes down to whether or not they can/will be bailed out.
I don’t think my 11/17 SPY $450 Puts were the play.

After this quarter, companies will be afraid to report their results.
How bad was DIS earnings? 

I have $175 puts but I’m worried it’ll just rebound in the am….
Your puts are ok
Why not read the earnings, look through last few ERs reactions and do the DD yourself?
Ain't nobody got time for that.
since almost all analysts are hyper focused on DIS+ pretty bad, bobby said in september it was going to be low millions, but still was disapointing, parks looking good but DIS+ is looking rather lackluster.
Missed eps by 23.4 percent
Pretty bad. But I remember last earnings,  when they nailed it. Stock was up like 4%, and then went all the way down to previous closing price, effectively destroying both puts and calls
I wanna DWAC off some puts. T-minus 15 days before they violate the open source consortium.

Right now it’s just cloud stock go brr but they’re too small time and had little capital to make serious growth moves. Hopefully this ipo will allow them to make good decisions with new capital.
Yeah, I was looking into it and currently they aren't experiencing exponential growth or anything. Decent fundamentals, nothing spectacular. 

But I have used B2 for years and respect them as a company. Not going bankrupt any time soon

You can buy spreads, check it out. I did so for COIN, spreads worked out better than just buying puts, as I had both.
Good shit and a good play. Hopefully more to come! Just remember us when you become a millionaire
Brother I am far from that :( but soon! Roblox puts are they way today along with TSLA calls. Plus AMD & NVDA ARE BACK ON THE BOARD! Puts on WISH as well!
If only MY CASH HAD BEEN ABLE TO TRADE. Like 20k loss in 2 weeks. Started w 3.5k so not complaining cuz still up 7k but still needa get back. 100k EOY😌
You mean 500k! This is the way!
U RIGHT!!!!!!
Nice! Why do you think it will continue to drop? It was negative double digits right?
Is PYPL gonna get up again or is it atm dead?
it needs a catalyst
It's gotta find a floor eventually, but I'm not sure this is it
NOK weak puts should do well on drop to 5.50

1015 was the floor for tesla and spy looks like it wants to close green today. We could still possibly  e dropping lower but who knows.

I just had a long talk with the r/investing mod team. They assured me that their users were nice and wouldn’t downvote me. They also brought up a possible mod invitation down the line. So I guess this is officially goodbye

My man. That’s right, Lagertha. That’s why I’m in love with her from Vikings
Astrid really does it for me also
Is their overly indulgent and unneeded nudity in Vikings?

If so im in
Not much bc it was a History Channel show
What a waste of kathyrns talents
Despite that… it is one of the most underrated shows that was on tv.
lol yup this is why fat people always eating shitty foods cuz it's all that tastes good to them anymore
So like shit?
Lol virgin
Staying away from overvalued IPOs
Most of the stocks are down 50% for the year since last year but the news act like stocks are making record high when it’s just tesla, amzn, google
There are still a lot of very rich valuations. The cracks are just starting to show in the most overvalued areas like ARKK shit.
Wtf lol no
The only stocks that matter
There’s a significant lack of breadth.  Lulu, Cost, Msft, Hd, others also still just pumpin along up up
Spy 500 eoy once we get past this little scare
I went balls deep on December 1 480c hope so
If spy gets to 500 by December 31st I'm condoring that shit till 2024. Maybe 2022 will be bullish but haha nope
Tomorrow is a bank holiday but the market is open. So all the major traders are not at their desks to pump the market. This could make an already volatile situation even more so. Going to be fun. Playing volatility for this week on VXX

It is normal to be physically attracted to a stock? (TSLA)
I wanna lick SOFI’s cunt 💁🏻‍♀️🤤💅🏻
pics ?
So here is what I think. I personally believe that the meme stocks (like GME and AMC) are being held up by two factors. The smaller is the fact that there is a certain portion of the float being held by apes. I think the larger reason is that option sellers are making bank on premiums. They have no incentive to let it fall. So what do we see? It stays steady, but whenever it starts to exit the trading range it shoots the opposite direction with lots of volume. It's enough to get the IV high again and incentivizes people to buy over priced lottos. Rinse and repeat for infinite money or until people lose interest.
I might try and trade off this theory
Green green futures
Bye bye miss American spy
It’s green now
AMD 155 Tomorrow fuckers
Yes Sir!
$26,000 profit booked in 2 days on 2 earnings straddles (DASH, BYND)

Both went the opposite way I would've guessed if I had to pick a direction.

It pays to be bi-curious
You're just lucky.

Good you cashed out.
what's the lucky part?
Those earnings could have easily gone the other way.

Goodluck but don't make it about your market knowledge loln
\> Those earnings could have easily gone the other way.

Hence the straddle strategy (non-directional bet)
What was the RoC though of longing vol into earnings
I specifically screened for stocks that were pricing in lower-than average ER vol.  BYND and DASH both pricing in < 10% moves, significantly below intraday vol in previous quarters.  75% and 160% return, respectively.
What were your SOFI strikes?
didn't play, options too spendy.  BYND and DASH my only earnings plays this week.
Don’t listen to anyone else. You are clearly a trading genius
True but I would probably have to watch like a 20 minute YouTube video to actually understand how to do it so I’d rather just burn money
Bought a car for $1000 it goes for like $1500 

I went over to his place and gave him full price 

If you aren’t happy with the price someone is willing to pay you and you think you can get more why accept? I said multiple times if you want I can get my deposit back he said no no 

He was constantly saying “holy shit this car is easily worth $2000 what the fuck did I do” and complaining so much I just feel bad
Should have sucked his dick bro. Seems like that’s what he wanted
I had a '94 full size blazer with BFG all terrains i bought for 500 bucks.  drove it for 3 years then sold it for 800.  i miss that fucking shitheap :( lots of illegal offroading in MA

My spy options are down 70% I need a big day today.+ 1.0  % would be real nice but really need + 2.0 % by December and I’ll be done until 2022. Taking the holiday season off. Maybe spend it in the Caribbean.

The bottom is in for tesla. Once we bounced off support it created a head and shoulders on the 2hr. It's nothing but green from here for tesla in my opinion. And we closed green today.

TSLA $1,420.69 is not a meme
Puts on Rivian? Lol
few more days until options are available. until then, hope it goes to 150 so i can sell for some decent profits.
i think you’re in the majority, but fyi wsb was bearish on RH, RH put holders that bought when the option chain was first opened got slaughtered
Sounds like $150c for February
Puts aren't available for at least 10 trading days, likely a bit longer.
Ohhhj fuck TSLA going to $900
lmao why

where you getting your info?
He has the sight
why woukd the stock drop to 1000 and then rebound back up ifnit were gonna go that far down again? whats controlling this stock price?
tell me more, at open or later in day you think?
how is this shit gonna drop when Musk is forced selling and it's not even dropping

like we know he still has more to sell and he doesn't have much time coz of taxes or whatever

and this shit is staying up like yo....this things gonna keep going up
You are Paid opposition! How much is burry paying you?
Do we rip tmrw?
I hope so, held my 25 Friday SPY 467 calls
470s here ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Ouch. That’s what I started with but yesterday I sold those for a loss to roll down to 467. I debated selling half near close just in case tomorrow was fucked but decided that would probably be stupid and shit would rally tomorrow
Im dumb and went all in monday morning and had no buying power left or else i wouldve, my calls were already down too much for me to sell for a loss
Its either rip or RIP
WSJ reports musk already sold - so jokes on the shorts.
Uh no, he sold 1/20th of what he said he would sell on Monday.  Maybe 1/5 on Tuesday, and a but today.
He has plenty of time to sell over the next 9 months.  It’s priced in.
You just pulling the 9 month timeline out of your ass? Or out of your ass?
Look at his comp plan
He's selling stock to pay taxes on the options. Payment is due on April 15th. Options need to be exercised by end of year or they expire. 5 month timeline at best.
I am sorry you bought puts.
I was long until 1240. No puts, no shorts, no position.
it means he has like 90% left to sell lol
1B worth. 930k shares

Thank god we finished enduring sell off from Elon Musk share Monday and Tuesday. It's up today cuz he is done selling. Tesla going back up to $1200 end of next week.
Maybe tomorrow
We can hope.
He sold half on Monday and half on Tuesday base on what we see on the SEC filing.

>	And according to BofA analysis, a 10% dilutive equity raise for Tesla could fund 40+ incremental plants and more than 10 million units of capacity, which would effectively make Tesla a fuckin powerhouse

Anyone explain how stocks drop or go up AH earnings when it's not out til 5pm?
people getting antsy

Or maybe the report is out but the earnings call isn’t scheduled until later
the fact the stock is dropping means bad news right? Is there ever a chance a reversal happens at 5pm?
what exactly is so special about 5pm, I’m confused

I have no idea which stock you’re referring to, but depending on how the earnings call goes, it could drop or go up depending on if some surprise news gets announced

see PayPal earlier this week to see how the price jumped briefly on Amazon partnership news but then dropped because the rest of the earnings call sucked
The reports usually drop right at close, but then they do an investor call at 5pm
where do you find
Because we’re the last people to find out the actual report lmao
does it mean that a stock is down AH, it's probably bad. Whatre the chances of reversals happening at 5pm?
I’ve seen it happen but usually when it’s this big it won’t. Sucks my sofi puts are dead 2 lmao
Cause they know before us

So I have $100,000 and need to re-evaluate my trading for 2022. Should I:  


1. Use 20% for degenerate gambling (all in on shares or options on each trade) and keep the other 80% cozy safe?
2. Or split my money 20% cash / 20% SPY / 20% option selling / 20% stock picks / 20% WSB gambling?

What do?
$100,000 in short expiry options contracts that have super low delta and really negative theta.

Honestly best way to x5-10 your money and retire
Run while you can! Casino has better odds! lol
I have considered that as well. With inflation being what it is I might as well travel and do some cool shit. Spend the money since that's what JPow n Company are incentivizing with their infinite money glitch.
If you know how to count cards then you are golden. Otherwise its puts central for the next 2 weeks
Last time I fought the Fed I won $40,000 but then promptly gave it all back and then some.
The Fed is never your friend!
I'd say #2 but split up the 20% for SPY into different ETFs like QQQ, VTI, VB, etc.
Meh using ETFs to "diversify" is overkill. VTI or SPY would be good enough.
I'd put at least some into QQQ. I'm up 2-3x on that in comparison with SPY in the same time frame. Unless of course you're bearish on tech long term.
Fair point and I considered/am considering cubes instead of spiders for that reason. My logic though has been that some level of exposure should be with the broad market, so even if I suck with my other plays, at least some capital is keeping pace with the broad market. 

2018 and 2019 I outperformed SPY but 2020 and 2021 I'm underperforming. So I'm having to reevaluate my approach.
For sure, just avoid junk I bought like BYND and OTLY and you'll be solid lmao
But thanks for the vote on 2. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)

Does the Ford investing in Rivian seem off
To anyone else ? 
Ford has that little faith in their company that they couldn’t pull it off In house .

Imagine if DoorDash owned 10% of uber eats 
Or McDonald’s investing in Wendy’s
> I don't think it is off. Rivian has a promising vision of the future and they have already raised over $700M from investors, so I am sure Ford will be able to recoup their investment if they choose to exit in a few years.
It’s a smart as fuck
Move
They invested in Rivian before they started their big push to EV.
If my calls don't pump after hours I'm calling the police
Who's more cocky: Elon fanboys, or Burry fanboys?
A) Elon fanboys

Next question
disgusting
Hello. Please answer the question.
burry is an actual chad though
Don't care. Asking about his fanbase. I'm starting to get my answer.
this was what is called a "joke"
Yes it was.
I will say that wish popping and dropping does assuage some of the bad feels of blowing $1500 on Disney calls.
1500 is chump change. Why waste time feeling bad about that
You can bet folks who are successful traders sweat losses of $1500. It’s not the $1500 now, it’s $1500 iterated over time. Losing plays cut into ROI. I sweat my losses.
Investing in BB. Banks and Baba
Keep falling! Seriously, who the hell is still buying Wish at this point? Just let it die.
What do I buy right now, I have 500 cad on me
Lube and calls my friend.
I genuinely don’t know what calls mean but I’ll look, thanks!
You’ll love FDs
Hope the WISH shareholder baggers sold during that fake out pump at the start of ah.

Options guys are screwed.
Options holders are screwed regardless. Unless they played ITM, 400% IV would kill their position unless it went like 20%+ on earnings
Yeah but they still have until Friday, IV gone by then. of course the call holders didn't win so that's irrelevant.
You guys told me tesla sell off today![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
That was yesterday dummy
Friday green I hope
You skipped Thursday lol.  Did you already write it off?
what are we thinking? spy red or green tomorrow. It can’t possibly go lower then it did today. It’s just consolidating for new ath right? Right??
460 then bounce probably, if it goes lower than that we fuk
I would have to agree, there is probably going to be a decent dip at open and if it continues there’s no looking back, hoping the bounce is big enough for a run
Idk even during sept when it was a bloodbath spy had its days where it would bounce even if it eod was red it bounced. We’re on day 3 right now I’m just hoping we’re green tomorrow. My calls hope so I can’t imagine a 4th red day in a row
Hopefully JPow steps in if we see another red day. It can’t last forever
Yeah Ik people be saying “elon selling 10% of Tesla or CPI or get ready because we’re at ath’s we should be dropping” but seriously this shit can’t last forever I’m still holding $471 calls expiring on the 22nd hoping for the best
MQ... non-Square revenue grew by 79% YoY.

The biggest criticism of MQ was its reliance on SQ for revenue.

Just like AFRM was shorted initially because of their reliance on PTON... MQ was/is heavily shorted because of its reliance on SQ revenue.

Not anymore... got A LOT higher to climb!
MQ has been a great play for me.  Wish I got back into calls before close!
I think it's going to $40... sooner rather than later.
I think you’re right- I’ve been looking for a nice discount on LEAPS but this Evergrande stuff had me hesitant on new longs!
Hey usa, you guys closed tomorrow?
nah we keeping markets open tmrw to let it bleed, gotta pay respects to the veterans
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
It’s a non-settlement day but the market is open
Been so long since I had a red day I forgot that color existed.
If all you guys just played in the money leaps on fang tech and bought in red days. You’d make $$$. That’s pretty much all to it. Instead you focus on trash like wish, Clov, and pltr and bag hold 🤦🏻‍♂️
80% of the people here can't afford blue chips, nevermind leaps on blue chips lmao
Faxxxx🤔
Word..  Been slanging CC's on PLTR for a year now..  working great..  Never was dumb enough to buy into clov or wish...
(serious market correction occurs)

FED: this is not allowed

“free market”
I'm not wearing pants
You're bullsih on Levi's?
I’m feeling long term bullish on LCID loading up on LCID calls tomorrow
Is that because of BOFA raising price target to $60 for LCID?
They can burn cash for a long time. There is some confidence they out last a lot of other start ups
No doubt. They got the longest range EV.
Store bought salsas are so shit. Either they taste like ketchup or just burn your insides.
I can always tell when I'm at a shitty Mexican restaurant by the salsa they bring out. If it's shit, then I bail before they can bring me a menu.
Right! It’s got to be something roasted and with more flavors than just tomato or heat.
💯 making your own is easy and delicious
I just don’t have a blender rn 😭
curse my fucking paper hands selling tsla calls on that dip today
I was about 5s away from doing the same thing, but I held and they ~~tripled~~ quadrupled in price in 1 hour
way to make me feel better

at least I dumped it into sofi calls
But I was going to make a BYND turkey for Thanksgiving...
Disney dropped only -4% on earnings. These days it counts as green.
It seems that it was not a joke when they said that TSLA does not follow SPY, but SPY follows TSLA. 

Everything big green AH since Elon news. 🤣
Tesla🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I have a love/hate, on/off relationship with $SOFI but she's actually a  great girl, really going places. Going all-in again 😘
how do you take a company as well known as Disney and just absolutely shit yourself daily ffs
I was reading Shakespeare and I was like I don’t understand any of this shit
ppl pretend to like it to feel smaht. I'd rather read Calvin and Hobbes
Who else is gonna buy PYPL calls? I think this dip is one that should be bought, and I noticed a double bottom on one of its timeframes on a chart.
March 2022 $250 is less than $5
aint no way it gets anywhere near 250 tho
You’re retarded.  It’ll be $300 by then.
I am going to wait for a noticeable uptrend.  Not sure it is done tanking yet or if theta gang will just eat away from being flat.
I did. Jan 19/22. Let's go.
QuantumScape puts 🚀
Got some QQQ 390c late this afternoon. Hopefully I wake up happy tomorrow.
Feel like Sofi didn’t pump enough to make up for today’s dump. Bye bye monthly calls
Was hoping for $25, but expecting more upside as analyst upgrades come in over the next two weeks
Got 26 11/26 calls and am stumped on what to do
Give them until end of week, could see run up by then. If not and you’re freaking out sell them, should be worth something at that point.
Definitely worth more then after today’s normal hours blood bath.
imagine paperhanding AFRM calls at close
imagine calling paper close at hand
Had my finger hovering over the buy button. That one stings a bit.
Can I post gains on a low market stock ticker if I blur out the ticker?
> No
Just tell the lie without the visual like the rest of us, Thank you
Hope there will be enough tampons no more bleeding
absolute best case scenario for bulls rn is that Elon is about 30% of the way done. more likely much less than that.

he's hardly begun ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
Nice DD you got there from the “trust me, bro. Twitter said so.” library.
SEC website and basic arithmetic but thanks for playing
Cool. You should double down then. Seems a no brainer.
I will. and I'll be sure to post my gains 👍
PLTR still at 23 huh?
Nirvana wrote the track Mmmbop
How dare you not credit the lyrical genius of Hanson
Nirvana was the first well known band to invest in $ROPE

That would explain what happened with Cobain…

Get a bidet you peasant
You spelled “wife” wrong
Prob the first piece of ass you’ve gotten in a while
Fuck…this is painfully accurate.
I can't tell if buying PLTR is stupid because the media regards it as an evil thiel military corporation or if its a genius pick that will grow into the 30s next year getting crapped on temporarily
Yes
Fuck my little asshole can't believe I followed some idiot and bought ZIM
Don’t buy foreign stocks.
>getting fcked by zim is basic bitch
Is it stupid to take a loan out of my 401k?
Not necessarily, since you will pay yourself back with interest. Depends what for tho
Do you see yourself leaving the company anytime soon?
Maybe. Maybe not, if market crashes you’ll probably loose it all anyway
Not necessarily. I have in the past and it worked well.
Depends on a lot of things. What are u thinking ? How old are you and how much
yes.  unless you can pay it back within 60 days or something like that...  earned income.  plus penalties for early with drawl..
I just want to put more money into the market
Yes
IV crush gonna be sweet tomorrow on SOFI for bears and bulls alike
SOFI -1% by open

dogshit company
UPST had similar earnings performance to Sofi and Affirm, but it tanked. Being up 300 percent and depending on 2 customers for 60 percent of revenue probably does that to you.
Upst expectations were sky high
Guidance
Anyone bullish on decorative gourd futures? Shaping up to be a strong yield this year, no DD, just love the season.
Are we dropping more or is the recession over
These lows are very low my friend. Im bearish.
PYPL will violently correct to the upside in the coming weeks
Needs a catalyst to go in that direction . They need to announce something idc what it is
I caught that falling knife yesterday and put 10k in at 201.30
How do futures work.
If futures stayed where they are till pre market, would spy open at 465.50?
No, it depends on which futures contract you are looking at.

There are December 2021 contracts and March 2022 and June 2022
Give or take around 50 cents on spy vs Futes
No, futures are an entirely different market than SPY. SPY tries to mimic SPX, which literally is just following prices and free float.

SPX futures are an entirely speculative bet on what the price of SPX will be in the future. It follows price movement of SPX, but doesn't have the same price because of the contract aspect and when a future contract ends.

But futures are an indicator of market sentiment, so SPY and /ES kind of arbitrage themselves.

y'all get access to BLZE IPO? Hoping to get all 60 shares I requested. at $16 I see nothing but upside in months to come. 


yes shares are gay, but boy did my Cloudflare print, I sold half of my shares for $10k last week. 


also I've known of this company and their work for the last decade. looks good to me.
Why is blze different than any other cloud storage? I dont know the industry.
https://www.bitcatcha.com/cloud-storage-reviews/backblaze/


shitty link but I didn't wanna Google further; plenty others to look up. industry leader and their HDD/SSD endurance testing/reports are constantly referenced and respected by fucking everyone. they have acquired so many damn petabytes of physical storage themselves, and been transparent since founding. 


I don't care much about getting wsb to buy, en masse reduces my chances of allocation, but just wanted to contribute my take on the IPO
anybody ever get the  "oh okay" because their texts arent long enough apparently

I can’t help but wonder which stocks will go up tomorrow
Some
Not the ones in your portfolio.
AMD gave back all the metaverse gains these past two days ..BLINK and chatgepomiy also gave back all their infrastructure bill gains. ....amd 150

Automatically triggering a bankruptcy when a company defaults on even one bond seems like a guaranteed way to get already defaulting companies to avoid paying anything, but then this is the country where if you injure someone instead of "accidentally" killing them you're forced to pay their related medical expenses for life.

As goes the usual, green at night bears delight. Lets see if it actually holds true.
I anticipate a smol pamp in the morn, but there's no news so idk what would change the markets mind about the sell off
due too veteran day no bond market today. so no change in the treasury bond?
We may be losing money and worried about inflation and the economy, but I work at a plastics factory,  and am still able to be hammered and eat a cold cheese pizza outta the fridge

So what's all the fear about?
let me know when they move the factory and install robots how it goes.
They're too cheap.

I'm the only QA on my shift and they have the cheapest product on the market.
Well, you should be fine. The customers buying the toxic plastic probably not so much.
Bro when they banned plastic bags and straws I was laughing my ass off.

Looks like you gonna get a lollipop for breakfast.
Moving up reee
CPI already forgotten Spy could open at $470
Damn it SOFI, the only problem that I have is that I didn’t buy more...
I broke the rule and sold stuff i actually wanted yesterday to buy more.

I love you Intel and Meta, ill be back soon x

Great long term value.
I can’t wait for drake to make an album about the 8 people that died at Astroworld. It’s gonna be fire 🔥🔥🔥
His destruction of hip hop will be complete
Hopefully it gets a Travis Scott feature
TSLA gonna close at 1,099 with fomo, then open in pre-market at 980 when the rest of Elon's shares sell.
Legit worried about that, but any time I trust my gut with TSLA it does the opposite...
People are gonna wake up early tomorrow to check the stock all, "Ok, come on 125.....   980?!?!   FAKKKKKK!!!!"
My average price right now is 1090 so 989 wouldn't be so bad lol. Wish I had diamond hands since the first time I bought TSLA a few years ago. I'm an idiot.
He already sold his shares on monday & Tuesday, one more form 4 will be out tomo ah that will show remaining shares which he sold on Tuesday, so far you are seeing oly Monday's sale form 4
He would of sold the rest on Tuesday and we will learn on tomorrow's report. Tuesday was the doom day
His shares are already sold, pal.
I work for a hedge fund, we are pumping Tesla and amazon tomorrow. Just a heads up
Proof or gtfo
My guess is a flat day.

Elon officially dumped all his shares. Back to our daily moon mission feat. TSLA. https://twitter.com/sawyermerritt/status/1458576813010079748?s=21
That doesn’t happen all at once


Him selling his shares was never gonna move the markets

He literally had to sell for tax purposes anyway

He is just trolling you guys lmao
Can you read? That’s nowhere near 10% of his shares. That’s like 100 million not 10 billion.
cAn yOu rEaD 

This is was just from Monday idiot.
sales actually recorded on Monday, not Tuesday when it crashed.

market absorbed his sales on Monday but sold off on Burry's tweet or who knows what else
[deleted]
Actually he, "bought" 2.1 million shares through options. :D
Full 10% should be 10 times that amount, no? Elon owns around 150-200M stocks of Tesla, in other words 15-20% of the company
> Elon Musk is a billionaire. He owns more than 15% of Tesla, but he doesn't own 10%.
[deleted]
But he sold 2M, not 20M. So only 1% so far. Why people are cheering so much already?

Edit: he actually sold way less. He only exercised 2M so far.
> He's a genius. He sold 2M and the price went up 20%.

#Pro tip

Futures are real and definitely an indicator of how the market will perform tomorrow
Here’s a tip. Don’t eat yellow snow!

Had a guy at work that would always say that. No one ever changed their expression when he said it but he’d keep saying it, week after week. 

Anyways…futes are 🌈

If I buy a lean hogs contract and make them all run on treadmills when they arrive does that classify as exercising my option?
Boo this man.

If you're smart, Tesla put 1k
💀
$475 for a 1k put. He just sold 5 billion worth of shares. It's about making money not sticking it to the man.

Bruh was oversold. Still shit company. My calls print tho
WSJ - Elon already sold $5 Billion worth of stocks in the last 3 days. 

IMO TESLA will go to $1300 tomorrow
This sounds regarded af. Damn it I’m in
Elon selling all priced in, moon back on schedule

Damn straight
Tsla after hours volume is only 1.5m, today we traded 44m volume, this ah green action can get wiped out in seconds, it’s off of very little volume
🤡🤡
Good perspective.
What a beast TSLA is
Kinda I wished I brought more calls now when it was at 1k this morning.
If you can figure out how AMC gets from $38 to $2 over the next year or two (maybe months?), you can make obscene amounts of money.

Normal valuation for them is probably around $1 billion.  It's just a matter of the other $18 billion of "hype" to navigate and how that evaporates over time.
If you can predict price movement, accurately, you can make money. Thanks man!
I mean we actually pretty much know they won't really be able to build a $20bn business.

At least with something like TSLA people can theorize about how it can fit into a $1tn market cap.

AMC will be back at $2 at some point.
Yeah - just messing with ya. AMC is worthless imo
Yeah you make a fair point though.  Figuring out how the stock gets back to that is the key.

I figure it will just start falling at some point and there won't be enough buyers to support.
I’m a TA guy and haven’t chatted AMC or anything, but I feel like cash is better played in more ‘predictable’ plays. AMC is a total coin toss from what I’ve heard
Yeah for sure.  I think key is probably to just follow US movie grosses and see if there are some disappointing major weekends that come in under expectations.  Might start the process of fixing its valuation.
Talk the CEO into selling all his stock?
The stock is almost entirely owned by retail at this point, so unless the apes give up I don't see the stock moving much either way.
They will though over time as it becomes clear their earnings will never really justify a $20bn market cap.  Eventually shorts will probably figure out how to sell it down without causing another mess.
From a valuation standpoint, it should be much lower, but we all know it's not a valuation play. You'd probably be better off buying it and selling CCs as long as the premiums are decent since the stock isn't going to move much at all for the foreseeable future. 

I wouldn't buy puts on cult stocks since they defy reason and logic.
Tried it.  Sitting on a ton of $5 puts expiring in December that I figured a year would be long enough.  Nope, The apes hold strong for what that is worth.   Don't want to waste money trusting that enough of them will give in and sell
I still wish GME, AMC, and BB (BAG trio) to moon simultaneously and it would be neat if gme hit 1m like they say... 

Then I'm reminded of how they can just remove the buy buttons and make tickers unsearchable

I’m trying to eat as much aphrodisiacs and natural testosterone boosters as possible. Lift weights 6-7 days a week and cardio 3x a week. Eat as much meat as possible. Cut off nutting entirely. I want to literally wake up see green portfolio and ejaculate on will. That’s my goal. That’s my destiny.
Virgins gonna virgin.  That no nut shit is more conspiratorial bullshit than you can imagine.  
Nut as often as you want.  It's not gonna change a mothafuckin thing.    
I promise.
What’s wrong with no nut? It keeps my mind occupy. I don’t want post nut clarity all the time. Post nut clarity fucks with the way I approach life. I’d rather limit that. And the whole goal of this experiment is to ejaculate on will when portfolio is green. U def can’t do that if u nut everyday. Need to get very horny first.

No one cares about Evergrande old news
Priced in. Tesla and LCID to rocket today. All the NIO peeps to moan about how many of their tier-2 cars are “alRdAY oN tHe RaOD”
Ol' Musky laid a huge bear trap. You didn't really think he was on your side did you?
You do know he only sold like 3% of what he intends to sell
He sold 10% of his $6.24 options. Sounds like he sold 10%, just like he said.
How did you find out?
He filed the form 4 with the SEC. Gives the number of shares on there. It's linked elsewhere in the thread. I closed the window I had open with it already.
I mean he literally said “10% of my stock” but he’s obviously not obligated to do anything
It's a 2 part form. The second form hasn't come out yet.
We're not short sellers...
[F in the chat for the prosecution in the Rittenhouse case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I7yr-JBQFQ) (and this is only footage from today's proceedings)
Lmaooo - that trombone is a nice touch
Sad Price is Right Trombone never gets old!
Lol these retards only prosecuted him so there wouldn’t be more looting and burning
The prosecution will be bench ad attorneys when this shit is done. What a easy money shot they wiffed.
Personally, I think that the facts of the case, that have been presented in court, have forced them to take desperate approaches to try to get Rittenhouse and the defense to slip up.

But I don't want to turn this into the millionth Rittenhouse debate thread, so I'll leave it at that.
Maybe your right, fellow tard.
Fry him
Prosecutor ripping Rittenhouse a new asshole rn lmaooo
He just loves protecting used car dealerships! he had no other motive to drive to another state with a firearm he shouldn’t legally have to definitely not start shit and shoot and kill three people.
They got bad witnesses
[deleted]
Haha NOPE! We buy the dip.
Fuk your puts
OK that's why it's taking off. He only sold 10% of his options. Not 10% of all his shares. Moon mission back on. Bears thinking he's obligated to sell 10% of everything from a twitter poll, lol.
You have no idea what you're talking about lol

He sold 2M shares Monday. That's all we know. It is likely he sold the other 18M+ on Tuesday when tesla had the huge dip. That would be approx 10% of his shares
Hey gave his word that he would sell 10% of his stake.   Are you calling Elon a liar?
Not at all. He didn't specify which stake though. Technically correct; the best kind.
HOLY SHIT ELON SOLD CONFIRMED
Spy +10% tomorrow 100% garunteed
You sound like the user axeman but the difference is i think he's genuinely serious
I’d be a very happy autist
One last pump before the dump.
Definitely as long as i can sell in the pump then buy puts for the dump
EoY rally man.

Money managers trying one last time to pump
Elon timed his sell announcment for maximum bears are fuk
Not really, he only sold like 1/20th of the lot.
1/20th of 2% of market cap.   
The numbers don't matter, the news does.
hes got till august, after seeing that shit drop double digits % wise. he better smarten up and tone the sell block size down.
Why would he wait when he already had said numerous times that the stock price is too high?
hes got more compensation packages coming his way. also its his company. i dunno if i owned a business i wouldnt wanna destroy its value (too much)
If you knew your business was valued at 1000x time what it was actually worth, would you really care if the market cap was lowered 10% in order for you to cash out a bit?  Since a few months ago we are literally in the biggest bubble to date. No one knows when it will pop of course, but its worth noting forward P/E for the spy are the largest to date. He is just making sure he gets his beforehand.

Bro my parents lost almost everything in the 2000 bubble.
I hope TSLA's sell off tomorrow wont affect the rest of the market.
Futures nice and green and Spy gapping up almost $1 never fails .
Bigly red tomorrow
Puts on your IQ

https://ibb.co/dBqtBwt
If that is a link to futures being up .11% 20 minutes after AH and you thinking it matters, puts on your IQ.  You from Taunton or Brockton?
China (country with 2nd largest GDP) isn’t going into a financial crisis 🤡
I didn't say they were
You did when you said “Bigly red tomorrow”
And you're ragging on my IQ?  "Bigly red tomorrow" does not equal "China going into a financial crisis"
It does after dipping $3+ in one of the most bullish months.
Bull r fuk just as I predicted last night.
Everyone needs to buy puts
Who bought calls EOD knowing evergrande defaulted

Remy has more game than Cash does
let's say your account is around 550k , how much cash do you hold ? I'd think 60k would be safe, but probably end up with 20-40.
> I have about $500k in cash, but I'm going to end up with at least 200-300.
I normally have negative cash
Invest it all and the get $300k in margin
[deleted]
Wanna spare 25k so i can unlimited day trade
I would man but I need the money to try to retire early
 :( i wouldnt even use it
What
I would just have it so that my value acc is over 25k and daytrade with my own money get it?
No I don’t get it.
25k sitting in bp so my port value is in the requirements for unlimited day trades. Would never use the money to make trades.
Which brokerage you use?
TD/Think or swim and RH
What do you use?
can you send me 5k? If I triple it I give you back 10k and I keep 5k.
> what are you talking about?
stfu nobody asked you anything
0 in cash because cash is an instant loss to inflation. 

Its better to hold some hedges for your long plays instead of cash.
But with 0 cash how would I double down on my horrible options.
deposit more cash obviously :)
bout 10% give or take usually a bit more around 13%
Year of expenses I’d say. Roughly

Expenses depend obviously on how you live
In trading accounts 0, I don't need lazy money just hanging out but a years income in savings/safe
The stronger the bear stink is around here, the safer I feel with my calls
god bless short sellers.
I setup a strangle before earnings on SNAP, I’m down like 5k on the four 65p’s I sold, expiration is next Friday.

Would you take assignment and try to wheel them away selling CC’s or just take the L now?

I don’t really want to own 50k worth of Snap shares but top analysts with really good track records are still really bullish on them after last earnings.
Roll them over to later date
shit thats a tough choice, folks will buy the wheel but it may end up costing more trying to wheel it if it flies unless its like a 80C strike or someting; feel like the bottom is in. 5k loss to me, sounds like the best bet. im a retard tho, NFA.
take the L on 5k. fuck holding 50k of snap, bullish analyst are trying to get bagholders dont be one of them. shit literally dropped 25-30% whatever it was, that sound bullish?
Need TQQQ & F to end the week strong

If the fed raised rates significantly I just don't see how the federal government could function with the cost of debt service and their spending problems. Also, all states and cities are fucked with debt and underfunded pensions.
Exactly.

I haven't been long TSLA since S and Pee induction but seeing Papa Musk selling all these shares and price staying this high even with indexes looking weak

......it's time to go gigachad long on tsla isn't it ?
That’s like, your opinion…man.
Only if you like big sneks
actually he sold less than a 1/5th and it dropped the price 17% in one day ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)

Gigachad short is the big brain play
No.  Catch a quick bite on an intraday call, but understand that eventually this stock and this company will suffer the fate of all overvalued companies.  Amazon maybe has another triple in it this decade, but TSLA certainly does not; it would be a century or more growing into its valuation if it did.
Amazon is cooked, they headed down
Maybe short term.  If they capture 90% of world retail, at a P/E of 15, 1% margin and no dividend, they eventually are worth $60K per share.  If they can then boost margins to 2%, or pay a dividend, they might be worth $120K per share.  There are substantial economies of scale and logistic efficiences inherent in such a concept that might make it attractive to a variety of nation-states.
I wouldn't write Amazon off, wait till they start delivering worldwide by environmentally friendly rockets.
I think no. 

I would rather have $100 worth of 11 different Shitty EV startups than 1 share of tesla.

One of those startups will be very valuable in 6 years. (And tesla bulls will still be trying to justify a $900B market cap.)

This post cured my depression
You welcome boo.
I don't care if its just premarket, being already up 25k just hits a different type of way
I just read this lil news nugget wtf..
"Biden nominee Saule Omarova saying the quiet part out loud. On the oil, coal and gas industries: "We want them to go bankrupt if we want to tackle climate change."
Because there is unlimited lithium inside of of mountains that we have to tear apart lol
either oil and gas go bankrupt or humanity does
Humanity is already morally bankrupt.
The world literally cannot function without oil. Good luck making international shipping and air travel solar powered you dumbfucks.
If wishing only made it so.
if you were down to your last $5000 in cash and needed a yolo play for a 5k what would you put it in for a day trade? My thoughts are Peloton puts , wish puts, ZM puts

or Tesla calls and Nvidia calls? thoughts

edit: hypothetical situation as I'm totally not down to my last $5000 ;)
This was my literal move… and I said fuck it yesterday and got 2,500 in sofi calls for today… that instantly dropped 30% lol thank god went green
so you made money? this gives me lots of hope
Stop . Just stop please
Probably Tesla
I feel like Tesla will dump just because everyone expects a pump
And that's why it's going to pump.
Nvda spreads, it'll end the week over 300 so maybe 295/305c. Might not be a 10 bagger, but its a safe double.
Can you imagine being Kyle Rittenhouse, virtually everybody in the United States knows your name, has their own opinion of you, excetera

Then it gets to be your one chance to speak out, to let the nation, the prosecution, the judge, the jury, finally hear your side of the story.

And then you get up on that stand with the little microphone and you just feel it well up inside you and you trip over some words and then you're just full on blubbering like a little bitch.

I oughta kick his ass and steal his lunch money. I mean I would, if I knew he didn't have guns. Now that I know he has guns I probably wouldn't do that, but if he didn't have any guns I would I would strike him in the testicles and laugh and call him a fucking bitch and bare ass fart in his face until he starts cryin

And then I'd bang his mom even though shes horrible trailer trash, just to see how he would react.
Dude looks like a bitch. Sorry if anyone is sensitive but its true.
I mean he’d probably shoot you dead, he has a tendency to do that
I thought he did fine. Hes still a kid... Really surprised people are defending the adults who tried to kill him though.
The prosecutor was an even bigger bitch though.
Ok
Please get help
He killed a 5-time child rapist. I'm already over it.
Cool story bruv

CPI data will be disregarded tomorrow, no tariffs, no tapering, no increase in interest rates, China not going into a financial recession, U.S debt ceiling priced in, Inflation priced in 

SPY $475+ EOW easy, mods ban me if we aren’t. I know I already got a banbet on ROOT but fuck that stock. I like America too much.
I just realized I have started making the same retard trades u make.  I’m totally fcked
Inverse this sub. I’ll probably get downvoted af but I like money
I think you got hurt today.
Got hurt but am still up. Just bought more contracts on sale. You’re retarded if you bet against the trend.
Hell yeah. My calls would love that
Elon Musk only sold like 2% of the 20 billion.  Big dump tomorrow when people figure it out.
That was Monday you smuck
Tomorrow will be the third red day in a row.
Yes
Tesla about to carry the whole QQQ to +2% TOMORROW

Nah yesterday didn’t have that spike

Fucking legal af buy order right before China confirms no financial recession w/ Evergrande. Where is the SEC?!
Oh it's you. I told you this would happen.
wym that's totally a totally cool and legal buy 🤡🤡
Evergrand defaulting and forced to bankrupt not a big deal?
Read the new bro, recessions over
They made their payments today
Was the initial news they defaulted today wrong?
I didn’t see that news. WSJ reported this morning that the Chinese government is helping them restructure. NYT just reported that they made a payment today 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/business/evergrande-bond-deadline.amp.html

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/evergrande-china-crisis-real-estate-developers-11636552507
Apnews was saying the opposite https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/business-china-evergrande-group-china-36dc3f16fe95c154a768d071345cdb77
Well, defaulting just means they didn’t make their payments by the deadline. After the deadline, you have a 30-day grace period to make payments. They have been waiting for the last day and making payments. So, technically defaulting on payments, but ultimately paying them 30-days later.
That’s just a paid release some analyst wrote
You mean the same NYT that lied last time? How is no one else getting this info?
Pretty sure that’s where the sell off came from.
TSLA back to going to $1200 EOW right?
20% gain after the start of this week, plus inflation. Doubt it, but then again i sold my tsla today, so tsla to hit 9000
TSLA is that one stock where a lot of us have to inverse our gut or otherwise have flawless diamond hands
for every one minute someone is unlawfully detained, the detaining law representative/s should be imprisoned for a week or a month or something extreme
Ok but your dumbass doesn’t get to determine if you’re being unlawfully detained only a judge does so shut the fuck up and do what the cop says, deal?
ever made love to a man?
I hope you didn't buy tesla calls.

Tesla will be 3 digits tomorrow or friday by latest.
They hit three digits this morning and rejected it so hard that TSLA spent most of the day ignoring a full market sell-off.


But, sure, you’re totally right.
It was 3 digits this morning
Dufus
I don't think it hits 3 digits until Elon confirms his sale. While I also don't think it breaks ATH, I'm pretty sure it's gonna float around 1100+/-30 until then
#Pro tip


When inflation numbers are high you should hoard cash, because that'll be worth way more than imaginary stocks, sell all your position and bury it in the backyard.
Tsla 1200c back on the table 

Tomorrow might be a bigly Green Day. 

VIX stayed under 20, volume was low on the selling…

QQQ immediately rallied after hitting 388 support the previous ATH

> Nah, futures are still good
Yea op doesn’t even have futures trading access. Major poor
Ok how tf is Sofi worth almost as much as Robinhood? Where are the sofi screenshots? Anyone here use it?
Sofi trying to be a one stop shop. banking charter and all that.

I dont have a position in sofi but yeah, it's not necessarily an apples to apples comparison.
They both make about the same in revenue
They only recently expanded into investment and banking, their core business was student loans.
Once the Students Care Act ends next year SoFis core revenue should go to the moon. Once the bank charter is done, it’ll go to Mars!!
Why are futures green ? Wtf… don’t you suckers care about inflation… total horseshit !

Spy still has some more downside for sure
Ban
Would you rather I lie while your account hits zero?
I like the honesty
I think it will atleast test 460 and possibly the previous ATH around 453.50
It's got gaps between 435-450 but who knows where it stops
I see it dropping really far, but I think the market will go for one more rebound before any huge drops
Yeah, nothing big now. Just a test to test the recent low which i'm sure it'll hold and then back to ath
Everything below 470 was a previous ATH retard
Why not? I do everyday to my wife when she asks how much I made

**Narrator**: *Little did WSB know, SPY hit its ATH of $470 for the next 5 years.*
Yes yes inflation off the rails that’s y we sell and go all cash
How do companies grow earnings with consumers have less to spend bc they are spending more on staples and wages aren't even close? .. so companies will earn less of money that is worth less, and that's supposed to be better than gold, commodities? Also, when interest rates rise, taxes rise... Companies will earn even less on more expensive capital... All of money that is less valuable. It's not as simple as cash vs equities..
So wtf happened in the last 10 minutes of trading??? A lot of stocks got pumped. 

We had a recovery from open - midday. Then we had a huge volume after lunch selloff??? And then last 10 minute pump. 

If this isn’t manipulation idk what is 🤷🏻‍♂️
It's not manipulation you're just retarded.
Please explain to this retard then
The treasury auction happened. Then people bought the dip
Well that I know. So everybody bought “the dip” in the last 10 minutes? Lolol why didn’t anybody buy the dip an hour before? 30 minutes before?
> According to the Wall Street Journal, a dip is defined as “a temporary decline in prices or value.” The dip that everyone bought was not temporary and it wasn’t even really a dip.
Bull trap I hope for tomorrow I wanna see things go lower so i can make some calls
COIN is criminally undervalued. It should be a $200B stock today and hopefully exceeds expectations over the next 2-3 years and reaches 1T.

I think I gonna need some miracle for my SPY 470 FD. Lmao
Get fucked
WISH SOFI report
God damn roblox puts were amazing today.
[deleted]
Bought 10 x $30 this morning with strike of $92 and sold then today for 300% gains.
What is WISH?
Look at that good boy WISH. People here need to understand that also a shit company can be undervalued
recover from the hangover i need to give myself rn 🙏
And I thought yesterday was bad smh what a bloodbath today. Made even worse cause they cock teased us the first hour . FUcking sadistic pieces of shit.

I played it smart in september but it caught up with me this week. fuck no idea what to expect tomorrow

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
466 11/12 spy calls and 10 11/19 fitb calls. Surely spy can’t be red three ina row. And averaged down on fitb. Waiting on them corn spikes
[deleted]
Damn sorry to hear that. Hoping the market will be nicer to us tomorrow 🤞
The bears are winning - try and make friends with them
I bet against Tesla I'm getting v&'d soon.

Tomorrow I'm buying TSLA
Day two of the whole market being a bloodbath
Humbling business.

I thought for sure AMZN and F would have mooned today. Not only that but I also thought Telsa was gonna shit the bed.

Yup had it all figured out and had a plan... then got my ass handed to me with the highest inflation rate in fucking years.

fuk
PSFE earnings in the AM. They are literally the worst.
Watching my F calls continue to plummet and drinking. That's my move.
Wish
Wish up 8% ah
SPY and QQQ puts for tmrw
all in Sofi around $13-$17. 😀
Same
I wouldn't buy that trash even if someone paid me for it.

Disgusting stock.
Lol someone hates money
$wish happening
Mouse is down!
I was like 5 seconds away from selling a put on sofi wow I hate my life
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Imagine being a soy boy who hold BYND
Shocker no one wants your plant based hippie bullshit meat
didn't have the balls to bet against the mouse. Hope  you brave mtherfkers get all the tendies tmrw
Who the fk is buying WISH at these levels lol. Shit needs to go below $4
Sold all my sofi shares before the market closed 🥲🥲🥲
Exact same. 

But that's ok. There will be more plays next week.
You'll be fine.

Just buy back since SOFI hasn't announced the bank chart yet. 

That would be the real catalyst.
What’s the bank chart?
SOFI will be a bank. They already applied for bank charter. Google sofi bank charter
Paper hand!!!
I guess because WISH was already way down, some may see it as a cheap buy? Any further and It would've been a penny stock. Far as earnings, who tf knows.
> WISH is dead.
DIS has good quarter last quarter, went down. Has bad quarter today, goes down. I thought we were never supposed to mess with the mouse...
Damnnn Bynd burgers taste that bad ??
They're not bad, but not as good as Impossible burgers imo.
Jesus F would be in a pink sheet if they covered every crash like they do TSLA
WISH is going to explode in 2022 with new CEO. If you had puts on Wish earnings RIP
I must say some of you invested in the most retarded stocks ever. What the fuck are you guys smoking!!!
Did you forget what sub this is?
1-2 IVs coming for you
3-4 gonna end up poor
5-6 PROG finna RIP 🚀
5 -6 have to turn some tricks.
Never bet against the mouse my DIS calls must be printing
F
Need 1 more -7% day from PLTR
$19 puts?
22
Was riding the RIOT BitFarms Train to glory when we derailed today. Fortunate enough to jump off before the big plunge in Bitfarms and made some profit off riot as well, but terrified of riding that train again.

Still, it’s on my mind.
Kinda feels like either MARA is severely over valued or RIOT is severely undervalued.

Looking at Pltr at it’s current price as a safer alternative to just park cash for some modest gains while I figure out what direction the miner trains are going.
Mara is over valued... riot did a big raise and so diluted some months back but now has lots of cash

The corn bull is still going..( unless china stuff trully fucks the world in)...so riot will too.

Riot results 14/11 i think. 

But pltr is a great play too
Well, you sound like you know what you’re taking about.

I’ll just follow you.
Spy already 464 we should see 465 in an hour
can Buyden replace this J Pow fellow already

i prefer my fed chairs to print market into ath's every day forever
Inflation is way up. Buyden and his agenda is toast.
Bulls might get cleansed tomorrow
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
not many left anyway, easy job to finish them off
BYND IS FUK 😂
I need 3 fucking professional references for this job and idk what to do. I only have 1 manager from my last job where I worked for 3 years.  Wtf do I do
Ask some other unrelated manager/coworker maybe
Lie.
Use your friends.  They literally can't do shit about it lol.
Give me $50. I will give you a glowing review.
Ask friends that have decent jobs if you can put them down and overstate there title. It’s all bullshit dude. They aren’t going to cross check numbers and names.
Prior professor maybe
If you’re this retarded, you’re really not going to get the job anyways.
Get them from WSB dude , We are all kind of special here 🤡🦧
Why r WISH dropping
shit Q4 guidance, ceo fired
Too lazy to find the gif but you know that college basketball ref coming in to the locker room getting all hyped? That's me with my 8 175 Disney puts. Getting a little bit less flaccid.
Does the tax return cover my short term losses? Even some of it?
Sell wish before blood red November
Cnbc and tv networks discriminates against non-beautiful girls by only hiring pretty ones
I'm sure they hiring,  just not to work in front of camera
Fine by me
Both AMD and LCID dropped 10% today taking it allllll the way back to Mondays prices. 

Will they ever recover?
glad i took some amd profits when i did. merger coming though.
It’s good people are positive but I’m viewing this as the last season of GOT and most of our main characters die this week
Except for Tyrone. Tyrone 4 life.
SPY $500 calls 12/31 dirt cheap at close.  happy with my purchase.
Yeah,  I got tons of those.  I added 500 SPY500 10/17s   today
Kinda getting "sell everything" vibes.

But I'm a retard, so feeling pretty good about throwing all my free cash into 475 spy calls
No one likes a quitter, get rich or go broke trying
You get 2 red days after 18 green days in a row and you’re already throwing in the towel? Psssshh
RIP HOOD, you won´t be missed
Anyone know why ASTS is up 2% AH?
Companies with founder CEO’s  >
BROS released their earnings, looks promising, gonna buy more calls. Dont think they'll have a problem matching SBUX
I'm from the PNW, BROS is solid. Superior to SBUX from a business standpoint and quality of product/service. Without a doubt a good long-term investment
Feeling cute, might go hard on DIS 175C 3/18/2022 at open
How long should I wait before I send an email to see if I got the job or not?
just show up and see what happens. companies like people who don't need everything explained to them
Just like Don Draper on his first day
worked for george costanza
My idol
I hear they like it if you check up every 15 minutes after until you hear either way
Maybe my messages are going to their spam folder by accident
Try calling
When you get to your car after the interview
Damn. I'm behind a week and a half
Depends, if she’s hot then I’d cum on her door to claim her
I'll check her LinkedIn.

It was over the phone 😕
If they didn't have you start filling out paperwork after the interview I got bad news for you.
Imma check the post office tomorrow morning and see if there is undeliverable mail for me there
Oh fuck, it's veterans day
Good idea. The post office is mad hiring tho
5 business days
A proper response. Thanks
Lol.  Good luck if you really are waiting on a response. ;)
I am. I'm patient enough to not be needy and let em finish but when you think it was a success, you kinda wanna know asap
In your email, you could always ask them indirectly about your status.  For example, you could ask them if there is anything else they might need from you.  Or you could send them updates about yourself, etc

You may really need the job in this current market.
🎉 I’m now a bag holder on $GDRX and $CRCT 🎉 

🥳
Need some more red days on amd, pltr, tsla and coin so I can go shopping
If you’re OTM weekly play prints

please sell and don’t try that again
Had a 5k account turn into 800 then turn into 7k now at 600 should I quit and take the 4K loss or run it back
is it an option or shares?
I have been trading options
well man, more details, expiry, stock and such. sometimes it worth just holding, you never know when itll turn around. been in your shoes too many times to count.
It’s NEGG or my leg cause ima sell this bitch to make up for my losses
Position? I'll show you mine if you  show me yours ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
Said it yesterday, say it again today, SPY's got some gaps to fill
Japan Tits Up 2.0
Bought the AMZN and Googl dip will wait for tendies tomorrow 

Stupid 🐭
So did Elon sell it all or no?
Look like he sold 10% of the 10% he said he would sell on Monday. So probably 30% so far. (10% a day)
Thought as much
We should start seeing things turn around tomorrow. Evergrande meets another interest payment deadline. Still defaulted but made their payment lol
It’s like me with my electric bill
Elon give me some gold

NVDA open at 289 and then you can do what ever you want
I want 309
I want 319
I’ll take that too, if I must
🖕
It's opening at 300+ and closing at 310+
Open at 292 and closing at 279
Markets are gonna 🚀 tomorrow because bond market is closed (algos will buy not knowing that) and when bond yields spike when they reopen Friday expect a sell off
“what you can’t see can’t hurt you”


holy shit, it’s genius
Lol algos don't know that the bond market is closed. You think they're programmed by high schoolers? But yes big green tomorrow
> What do you mean?
Remember higher inflation, higher stock value, lower currency value.

Your CEO sat in on the SOFI call and got skurred
All in on used car earnings

Shifty shift. 

$30,000 baby. Ready to go broke or moon.
My brand new civic bought six months ago is now worth 5k more on trade than i paid. Nothing makes sense
So tempted to sell my car but I love it and I live 17 miles from the office and live in a suburb

Pay off credit card debt with the $20k (taxes accounted for) I made the past 2 weeks or yolo it?
Oh dude get that credit card debt paid. That interest will eat you alive over time.
80/20… pay off most of it to get your interest payments down. Keep 20% to yolo and try to do it again
dis is da way.
75/25 debt payoff/yolo
If you lose it back you'll have major regrets and will take longer to pay off your debt + high interest rates. If your yolo would have worked out you'll have fomo but will never regret not having debt.
#Yolo lambo or bust
Pay off credit card debt. Do the smart thing
CC debt. Guilt free house money YOLOs after that.
BK7 and hopefully next time youre doing the yolo in a tax haven account.
yolo, cardboard boxes are real nice this time of year
Buying PROG
Lee Pace is an amazing actor, Halt and Catch Fire is one of the best series of the last decade.
...These valuations are absurd...
Absurdly low?
Nah, not with 6% inflation. Double inflation rate means we need double YoY % increases

Someone getting tar and feathered tomorrow 


Question is who....
🙈🙉🙊
People holding tsla puts
Why did SPY jump today at the open? The news were terrible!
They announced a new CEO
Earnings beat
TSLA dragged it up at 9:30 and then the low ticker performers kept plunging and dragged it down after that despite TSLA.
ppl will jump at literally any dip now.
Inflation impacts bonds negatively which impacts companies with high debt. Otherwise buying blue chip equities is a classic inflation move. 

That is unless there is stagflation. But despite slowing GDP growth and unemployment numbers both are going in a positive direction. Inflation + unemployment rates rising will be bad.

Now WTF is going on with TSLA? A wild growth with plenty of debt...IDK

Would you do gay porn for 5000 Reddit platinum awards?  Also your family and employer all get to see it
We just call it porn
I don't even take my free reddit awards
I would do porn for $20 and send it to my mom myself
No. I used to be one of the top memers on WSB (check my post history like 11 months back) I got like fuck tons of karma and awards. Its all useless meangingles sbullshit,
Honestly there’s some bangers in there
Thanks appreciate it bro
I appreciate you. The recent bull one put me onto that Genesis song
Oh yeah Justice is so good. Check out their album "Woman". It slaps hard

Did everyone leave Robinhood to join SoFi yet?
why is inflation up? is it the labor shortage and supply chain issues? or  something else?
> It's the labor shortage and supply chain issues.
God this bot is OP
And money printing?
Probably less because of that.

Supply and demand drives prices way harder IMO, and businesses wanna make profit while being nervous about constant shipments.
Printing money drives demand lol
developed worlds are consumers. They are vaccinated and commencing a consumption frenzy.

developing worlds are manufacturers. They are still struggling and not able to meet the demand.

Inflation will stabilize when America helicopter drops vaccines all over the planet. 

We could probably also use another port or two since insane amount of ships full of containers are still in queue.
Stimmy checks, rent moratorium and overall shit jobs. People just quit and employers can’t get the slaves to return. A dollar raise won’t do it. 

Labor costs are up. Also, globalization showing the people who bought into it that it’s not good long term.

EV fans. Is the US infrastructure ready for a ton of EV vehicles to hit the roads? With a range of 300 miles, seems we need MANY more places to charge them. Will most of us hang back and wait for more to be installed before investing these new vehicles? I love CHPT for this reason BTW.
>Is the US infrastructure ready for a ton of EV vehicles to hit the roads?

Not anytime soon.
how are you going to charge your EV living in a high rise apartment building?
There’s at least a few job postings out there for major companies like BP on planning out the infrastructure.
EV is a Ponzi scam….   Only 2% of people even want an electric vehicle 🤪
>2%

Where’d you get that from?

Can any of you degens explain to me the concept of being tired but not being able to sleep? Like wtf is wrong with me dawg
For me it stems from not wanting to be out of control. I am tired, but being awake means I’m I able to do whatever I want, whereas sleep mostly just happens to me. It’s difficult for me to capitulate.
Brain needs to flush but the toilet is clogged.
Stress and/or too much caffeine will do that for me

With the Evergrande situation the smartest move by the Chinese Govt is to let the Evergrande company die but assume the debt obligations. It'll send a message to overleveraged companies that the debt will be taken care of but the companies and its employees will not be.
Evergrande paid it off in time.
They paid only some of their overdue debt, not all.  Also what about the next payment that they can’t pay
The problem is that they’re big enough, and the underlying problem is widespread enough, that to just let it fail could start a chain reaction
Dafuq was that GME spike, so volatile these last two weeks
evergrande nonsense is great buying oppurtiunity

If I started smashing a guys head in with a skateboard while he held a ar15, I would be upset if he didn’t shoot me
Smashing a guys head in implies that he was hurt, which he was not.

Sorry retard this is a place for losing money not your take on political cases. Pls direct yourself to literally anywhere else.

Why did you delete your moronic Viet Nam post?
I'm drunk. I'll answer in public and not answer if you want but it's hard to convey to zoomers what actually went down. You simply think the world is nice.

My experience is a Vietnam veteran being my best friends dad and another one of my best friends iwas a young girl in refugee camps...

What do you know first hand ??

I'm happy to talk but I'm trying to convey their message.
It’s always just about resource control, we don’t intervene in the Congo because the slave trade there is amenable to capitalist expansion.
Uhhhhhhhh what lol
He’s talking about possible real shit, contrary to news stories.
You are a fucking idiot moron. Shut up
Don’t take the bait. My other reply is the truth.
Do better europoor, we can't do everything
This makes not one lick of sense lol
It does. 

America has been managing the world with very limited help, europoors act outraged but do relatively nothing and try to be nice instead of getting their hands dirty.
What does this sentence have anything to do with the original post lol? Is everyone just hammered right now? Is this a joke?
Really he’s stacked to the tits on calls after a down day and hopes international markets save him.

Yeah? You a big Hitler fan?
Americans were pretty amenable to hitler, we only got involved after Pearl Harbor, before then we sold guns to both sides until the Europeans put in a blockade so we couldn’t sell guns to Germany anymore. The Russian communists and the French did a lot of the fighting and dying to resist fascism, we just had the bankroll to end the protracted conflict.
Yup, for the most part true. It doesn’t support what he’s saying at all, not sure if that was your intent. 

If you’re a history buff, look up how much steel America sent too Russia during WWII. Without American steel they would have been crushed multiple times over. Without America, you also don’t have the reopening of the western front, which was crucial for the further weakening of the Easter front. Given even a little more time, Rommel would have fully been able to secure the Atlantic Sea wall, which would have freed up a large portion of Germany’s army. It’s undeniable that Russia expended a immense amount of lives, but that had a lot do with to poor command and shitty army structure and equipment and not just the scale of the war.
I’m saying that America wasn’t what ultimately defeated hitler. Basically, they were doomed from the beginning due to their limited access to oil, but American materials and money definitely ameliorated a good deal of suffering. The Russian army was riddled with problems, but they were much more ideologically opposed to fascists (most especially the leadership, but a large percentage of the soldiers as well).
Agreed, no one country or army is responsible for taking down Hitler. But it’s undeniable that the US army contributed heavily to the Third Reich’s defeat (so the obviously false statements that “the us army never did anything good” is false)

Correct, the Axis needed oil, and that was one of the biggest reasons for the African theater (production, and transportation via the Suez canal). Whether or not that was doomed to fail is debatable. Italian incompetence contributed heavily, but Rommel and his Afrika Corp could have turned the tied, especially if more German resources were deployed in Africa and if it wasn’t for Montgomery and Patton and the United States II Corps. Germany could have had access to unlimited oil and further resources from the East if it wasn’t for the Allies in Africa and Axis mistakes. Oil was a very large factor in the Eastern Front failure.

Additionally, the US contributed heavily in destroying German’s allies, which obviously has an effect on Hitlers expansion.
My position isn’t that america hasn’t done anything good, just that america wasn’t so staunchly anti-hitler, and wasn’t what caused the third reich to fail. I’ll grant that it’s debatable that their limited access to oil was intractable, perhaps If they could have deployed more forces to Africa and defended the supply lanes and america did not intervene, it is theoretically possible that they could have had enough oil, but just as possible that the extra forces used to secure resources in Africa would diminish the army below a critical mass of soldiers able to hold taken territory, and/or the acquisition of that oil would have piqued American interest in joining the conflict even without Pearl Harbor, America was a huge source of oil and having a potential winner of the war who was oil independent would definitely be an incentive for America to join the fighting directly (they had basically gleaned that if the allies won the war, they would still be dependent on American hegemony for rebuiliding their countries and that was much less guaranteed if the axis powers won) as opposed to is largely economic role in the early stages. America absolutely contributed to the allies in ww2, that’s not in question from me. What I am saying is that Americans were hedging their bets until the allies made it incredibly difficult to supply the Germans and the allies had incredible debts to the Americans that america wanted them to pay back. American didn’t hate hitler, America loved money, and after world war 2, we controlled about half of it.
Much of American Business definitely wasn’t anti-Hitler (queue picture of Henry Ford getting ‘The Grand Cross’), that that’s a very true.  But American business elite =/= America. At the height of their popularity, the American Bund, which was the largest American Nazi movement at the time, was able to rally 22k members at their Madison Square Garden in 1939. They were met with over 100k protesters who were staunchly anti-nazi and anti-Hitler. Let’s keep in mind that many of the Bund came from across the country and most of the protesters were local. 

Additionally, within a year of their peak, the American Bund completely collapsed due to lack of support. The American people really didn’t like the invasion of Poland and German’s deceleration of war on the UK and France. Every member of the Bunds leadership was rounded up and arrested throughout the early beginning of the war. 

I think it’s important to remember that up until WW1 and WW2, the US public still believed heavily in the founding fathers mandate for keeping out of European wars. It was seen as a moralistic choice, as well as one based on protecting America’s interests. 

Anyway, I enjoyed this conversation. Thanks for the info and sharing your perspective!

Lmao GME shares will now be worth infinity after judgement day. I sure hope nobody sells for inifinty -1
1111 TSLA is gonna🚀
Why ?
Elon Musk finished his dump 1.1 billions worth of TSLA
Look like that premarket green be fake as fuck.
Yeah, I expect red or flat today
Inflation fear mongers like jack Dorsey love to say "use the pre-1980 methodology" as if that doesn't obviously expose them as having an agenda

Technology accelerates, different goods and services are purchased at different rates, the rate of change of the economy is nearly exponential, and the founder of Twitter wants to go back to measures that predate Twitter.

DVDs used to be included in the basket of goods used for inflation and also we have iPhones now why would we pretend it's like the 70s
idk what you're talking about but this does raise a good question: who the fuck is buying all those DVDs at Walmart and Target?
People who don't have bank accounts and just have a TV and DVD player from childhood
Game over bears!
TSLA calls go BRRRR???
I fucking hope so. Mine are too red to go brrrrrr, but I'd settle for break even.

Do you think hookups destroy your soul and damage your ability to pair bond?
better than jerking off all day
If you hook up with a lot of dudes but want to be with a chick, then you probably don’t really want to be with a chick.
I don’t believe in a soul, but they are definitely a poor substitute for someone who is very lonely and wants a deep connection. It’s bad triage for a sick brain, but it’s perfectly fine for someone who is stable, has healthy friend/work relationships, and doesn’t develop a kind of game-ified mindset towards the opposite sex where they exist only as sex objects. Most people are too romantic despite themselves for it to work out well for very long.
Prefectly healthy unless you're looking for a real connection. If you want something real you should try waiting a few dates before you take her home.
Only if you're a chick

I have more gains left than you but I fear not for long
If the past two days wrecked you anally you are in for a very rude awakening if a real pullback happens
Finally recover from what? Where the fuck have you been the two weeks prior lmao
Elon sold
Since when the fuck is DIS a streaming company?? That’s all they’re harping on 

It’ll bounce back quick
Bounce back? Yes. Quick? No
Since like over year ago bro
Are me and options and tren the swollest wsb members, I’d like to think so
I used to lift for gains, now I lift for mobility & endurance. Cycle like 5-10 miles every other day, leg day in-between that.

You can be big, but I can reach my back.
I agree with you, but you’d be surprised at what I can do with being 5”11 250ish I’m running a half marathon in February and have been running 3 miles 3x a week on the days I don’t lift, I also trains jits twice a week but I agree. Quality of life for me starts to diminish when I get over 220 and really starts to diminish over 240lbs and over 260lbs Is literally the most miserable existence ever. It’s brutal. I’m 260 in pfp
Bruh, how do you deal with chafing……. Fuck THAT SHIT
That’s not even the worst part being that big literally everything sucks everything. I don’t know how obese people do it I would off myself
where is tren
Haven’t seen him in a few months idk where he went he will resurface tho
I drink tren juice for breakfast!
Wait, Phunware posts earnings tomorrow. It was pumped from like less than a dollar a share to \~$14 during that Trump shit and currently sits at like 4. Going to go all 🌈🐻on that shit for earnings

Are riots priced in after KR beats the case?
I doubt TPTB want to bring any extra attention to how abysmally incompetent the prosecution has been
So far the prosecution has done a better job defending him than the actual defense team
On the brightside if he beats it, we are all cops now. Im just gonna start arresting random people.
Well we're all allowed to defend ourselves at least.
Yeah ima go look for random people fighting and defend myself against them. Fuck the law i am the law now lol.
People who haven't watched the video of the shootings or any of the testimony at trial are easy to spot lol
Did he live on that street? Why was he there?
There's a reason why the judge isn't letting the prosecution use that argument. The kid shouldn't have been there but that isn't what he's being tried for
Well good then i can be a cop and do what i want and now i know the judge wont allow it. Thanks for the tip. Man gotta take full advantage of all these slippery slopes.
The "she was asking for it" argument.
Yeah. She was asking for it. She got to shoot a couple people she didnt like. To be fair, the kid does look like a bitch.

You would think so right?
How is Elon selling bullish? Lol wouldn’t that indicate he knows the top is in
No
Typically when insiders sell shares it’s not bullish at all
Usually they don't broadcast it. More of a gotcha with them
Elon is a different beast because he has a cult following who believes he can do no wrong
Basically he’s selling now to reduce taxes when the government raises capital gains tax next year. All he did was get cash to exercise his options and ultimately get more shares. Bullish
The sun's death is bullish for TSLA because ItS a TeChNoLoGy CoMpAnY
Why is TSLA up AH? Elon sold some stock on Monday but isn’t done yet. How’s that bullish?
A lot of people take the articles for saying that he sold all the stock he was going to sell on Monday, when it reality it is about 1/20th of what he said he plans to sell.
> Yesterday, Elon Musk sold $10 million worth of Tesla stock. That's a bullish sign for his company and the market as a whole

On the morning of 3 February 1945, Roland Freisler was conducting a Saturday session of the People's Court as its president when United States Army Air Forces bombers attacked Berlin, led by the B-17 of USAAF Lt. Colonel Robert Rosenthal. Government and Nazi Party buildings were hit, including the Reich Chancellery, the Gestapo headquarters, the Party Chancellery and the People's Court. Hearing the air raid sirens, Freisler hastily adjourned the court and ordered that the prisoners before him be taken to an air raid shelter, but stayed behind to gather files before leaving. A hit on the court-building at 11:08 caused a partial internal collapse, with Freisler being crushed by a masonry column and killed while still in the courtroom.

The floor for tesla was around 1025 and we bounced right off that shit. And we finished green. Nothing but bullish indicators
1018* right on the 20MA
Yea around there. I honestly belive  it's up from here bro
Elon gonna sell again. You got played my man.
Alright guys it’s my bday today. I have one wish to use. Now tell me what’s the plan for everyone to make money.

Is anyone here an investor or a customer of Kura Sushi?

I am currently researching them. It is conveyor belt sushi chain. In short, what caught my eye is that they are increasing revenue and expanding in the U.S in times, when the overall restaurant industry is doing pretty bad. Also, their way of operations is very popular in Japan, but kinda new for the U.S, however customers seem to love it. Sadly, I am not from the U.S so I am unable to test their services by myself.
#BITCHES LOVE SUSHI. GO ALL IN!
Everyone loves sushi
That is the way their eyes light up like xmas trees
Feels like a company that would be particularly sensitive to volatile input pricing and expenses and have trouble keeping consistent quality/standards at scale
Conveyor belt. Sushi. 

Drake and Josh?
There's one in my city. Always busy even when there's better sushi places near by. It's a decent product though, and the conveyor belt model seems to make it a less intimidating way to try sushi. I didn't even realize it was a chain/publicly traded until just now though. 😯
Nice. I think it is worth it to check them out.
wouldn't this business (conveyor belt, food exposure to many people) be banned or have slowed down significantly due to covid?
It kinda did in 2020, but they are booming now.
WISH CEO just stepped down. Bezos is unemployed.... Hmmm
Perfect time for Elon to swoop in and run a 12th company… gotta go for the double cuck

As if ya'll needed anymore evidence that AMC is a red herring. 

Fucking retards, GME was the only play, always has been. Hedgies switched to long AMC during the January dilution and keep trying to peg GME to AMC because they are basket shorted together. 

AMC is their GME short bet hedge, and you deserve to get gaped if you went AMC over GME
"Hedgies"  


Jesus...
Meme cultists really resorting to eating their own now huh
AMC isn't one of us, anyone here before the media circus knows it was, and always has been a distraction. 

Hedgies have been long AMC using it to hold GME down for months now. 

Was cheaper to wrap GME and AMC together and straight up buy out AMC than to pay GME hodlers what's owed. It won't matter in the end though

You sound like a young guy trying to make your way. Been there, done that....enjoy the journey. The facade of CA will wear off, it's not as pretty as appears at first glance.
I live in Oregon, not CA. Been here for about seven years. It’s actually prettier than it appears at first glance. The weather is perfect almost all year, mountains in the horizon, I can drive forty minutes in any direction and take a hike in beautiful woods, go camping any time I please in stunning surroundings. 

Texas is a hot flat mess with cheap houses and good beer. No thanks. I miss the beer, but other than that…

Bois load up tesla calls 

1300 eow
Why is SPY ripping
YESSS THATS WHAT I NEED SPY TO 466 THEN IT CAN CRASH
So on a very commonly traded S&P 500 company which normally has a very tight bid/ask spread what would you think was going on when a one ITM call still had a tight spread, but a one ITM put for the same expiry had a much larger spread than normal and than the one ITM call?
r/options
Volatility skew.  Probably reflects that a human was buying that put.
I got it backwards. The call had the big spread and the put has  a small spread. The put only had a volume of 1 today and the call had a volume of 50 despite the wide spread. Both have about the same open interest. Would that help hint at anything else?
No, just that someone's making a directional bet that's larger than the algorithms usually like to cover.  Smacks of human intervention.  Someone probably promised the trader a banana split if his trade hits.
Markets are healing!! Sucks whoever bought puts at the bottom
anyone else in DIDI ? Hoping for an eoy jump to new highs

Am I the only one who thought No Time to Die was absolutely terrible?
All the bond films are a snoozefest, but casino royale isn't too bad.
Yeah it pretty much sucked. I mean in a vacuum, if it were a standalone film it's an alright movie I guess but it is a dogshit James Bond film. Paloma was more 007 than anyone else in the movie. She deservedly stole the show and was the absolute best part of the movie, her performance was the only time that I was not rolling my eyes or bored out of my mind
No. It sucked. Except for the intro.
ROOT and WISH
WISHing my ROOT was bigger
anyone think it could be worth going into DIS calls tomorrow for a reversal on Friday with the disney+ day event? or not worth the risk
> DIS is an extremely overvalued company. I would not recommend purchasing any options on DIS until the stock goes down significantly.
There just isn't any upside to DIS for the next while. DIS already had a really high valuation and that was only justified when it was continuing to grow and increase profitability. Disney+ has hit a wall and otherwise they are struggling to find ways to grow. If things don't change radically in the post COVID world for Disney then they may see a massive decrease in share value.
This is a test:

How is TSLA up 30$ after hours with musk selling I have calls btw
This is all a simulation. Just make sure your bills are paid and you have plenty of weed,
I don't wanna be high when they turn the simulation off, gotta make a good first impression when they let me out the pod
Shit. I hate you for opening that possibility to me. Now I have something to mull over all evening.
Did you figure it out?
Very low volume, ah doesn’t mean shit, only 9:30am mean something
Because announcements are bearish and selling is bullish. It’s much like announcing offering is done. It’s gonna rally tomorrow
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Low liquidity
ppl assume bro is done hence filing
Look at that AH volume, it's like 1% of the regular session and today wasn't even a very high volume day.  ToS tracks a number called Volume Weighted Average Price and usually AH action isn't enough to move it even a penny
Argh - may have pulled the trigger a little too soon on my gme 11/12 200p

So anyone hear more about Evergrande? Not seeing it much in the news. Guessing it’s just irrelevant at this point
There’s the FUD post on the front page where he thinks 1 billion in US exposure means anything. One high rise in New York or Chicago is worth that much alone. Our markets will be fine
I think the bigger issue is that if China's economy falters, there will be rippling effects through the US due to supply chain issues. Especially in the already crippled vehicle sector.
I read that as more cheap labor to make our shit 😂
Interesting theory! Haha.
It’s official they defaulted, investors will be filling bankruptcy!
Basically, they continue to be able to find creative accounting ways to pay off their interest payments.  


No bailout but they also are forbidden from going under. So instead they have to die slowly and quietly, selling off assets to pay debts.
They had their biggest amount of payments yet due today. Actually we’re sue a month ago today ended the 30 day grace period
I have been reading a lot about Chinese real estate in general being caught in a "negative credit loop"...
CCP will force a merger at some point.
It’s irrelevant until it’s not
Getting the same vibes as January-March 2020 with Covid. It's not a problem... until it is.
Imagine thinking high inflation is bad for stonks when Powell just told us he won't raise rates🤡🤡🤡
Yeah because inaction to address a problem is a foolproof way of solving it. Ticking time bomb hombre
Imagine thinking Powell is gonna be fed chair next year 🤡🤡🤡
replacement is even more dovish. the left wants to stack the fed with ppl who will guarantee free money.
That’s true, but even the most dovish will raise rates in the face of hyper inflationary pressure. The difference is Powell is boxed into a corner, he gave guidance that he wasn’t really going to raise rates and he’s also compromised in terms of legitimacy because of the corruption that occurred under his watch. A shakeup is likely to occur at the fed.
a shakeup is bullish imo for reasons i just listed. and inflation is not even close to hyper inflation yet. they can wait a while.
Well I was replying to somebody who said Powell said he won’t change rates by pointing out that Powell won’t even be there. How did this become a discussion about who is more bullish or not?
> You are a fucking idiot.
What inflation? I just picked up a few gallons of milk for 2.60.

Whats a share?

I sold 11/12 $22.50 put today.
> A share is the smallest unit of ownership in a company.
What about fractional shares?
I don't think you technically have ownership with fractionals, I believe the broker owns the actual share
Just don’t expect a quick turnaround. Make a play for at least a few months out.
I would. I’m not going to but I would.
I heard investing in stocks pays 40% interest a year

Why does taking a zinc supplement hurt my stomach so bad? Even after a giant meal it makes me super nauseous.
Because you're a pussy
You’re supposed to take the tablets not eat pennies
Sounds like an acute case of lilbitchosis
because you're fat and poor
Really got some excellent feedback here. Thanks all.
Nah man you might have a slight zinc allergy. My wife has one, and she gets super sick off zinc. It's actually fairly common
Shouldn't do that 

Maybe you have stomach issues
Yeah maybe. My wife has the same thing going on though. Maybe they are laced with tren.
Just skip the zinc and pin some tren+test

I have made 209k from TSLA and  ELON selling Is not good you retards. Think of the inside info he has. Wtf is wrong with yall
I too would like to buy back my calls.
What if he knew market is overbought? Came up with a reason to sell, and made it seem casual. Tomorrow mouse gonna tank dow too. Gonna be bad
He already sold $5 billion worth shares and I am crying after my $15k
No he sold $1 billion, you really that retarded you can't READ?
Don’t be a cunt.  Wall Street Journal says $5 Billion.
Fair enough I'm the retard lol. I see they have updated the CNN article I read earlier. These media fucks never get it right the first time lol.
Well, kneel and apologize 😄
Yes sir, I am sorry, he indeed only has $15 billion to go.
Tomorrow I think it’s gonna go up and by Friday perhaps $1300
If futures bounce here I'm gonna cry

Fellas,,,it has been a fortnight. I’ve come here in a time of crisis.

Are my $TSLA calls going to be ok
If you have more than a month on them, you will probably be okay. If you have 2 weeks, you should still be alright. If you have a week or less your pooper may be out of joint for a spell.
12/3 and 12/10
How far otm though? If you have 1500 call, you may get gaped anyway.
1245 1315 1350 both expiries
when the market is done with you - you won't even be able to hold your mud.
I think you’ll live by the skin of your teeth.
It’s gonna be one hell of a ride in

Or out
Looks like Elon only sold about ~5mil of 17mil shares the past few days... I too ponder what's to come tomorrow...
Sauce ? I heard people saying he already sold it all on Monday and Tuesday causing the -12%.
https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings

Twitter people have already added up the totals Elon sold from Mon-Wed from the SEC filings posted on Tesla's site. Only amounts to about ~5mil shares.
Interesting. I just looked it up and it’s even slightly less then 5 million. I wonder if the buyers from yesterday knew about this. Otherwise there could be another crash today
Transfer you calls on over to FUKT.
What are some good stocks to but for a novice? So far I have 1 GME share, 3 Microsoft, and 1 AMD. I may invest another few thousand if I can find a good stock.

Try the far out of the money puts at earnings. Always a safe play.
I'm not familiar with options terms yet but I plan to learn. I appreciate the advice. So what you're saying is look for companies doing earning in 4 or 6 months or so and buy some puts for them? I'll have to research exactly what out of the money means
I was trolling, sorry man. Far OTM puts are puts with strikes way way away from the current underlying stock price. Buying them right before earnings when implied volatility is high is (in most cases) one of the fastest ways to lose money because implied volaitility collapses 

If that doesn't make sense, just ignore me. Buy some shares. Have fun. Be safe
Thanks for being honest lol
He was kidding . Careful who you listen to on here
Googl, tsla, aapl
I would go small caps (penny stocks) if I were you, Microsoft & AMD are too big now they are more for protecting wealth than making it. I would also sell GME it is way overpriced & a dying trash business
☠️☠️☠️
Mindmed. Psychedelics, MDMA and DMT. Cheap right now take a gander
Any stocks in this area beside Mindmed worth looking into?
ATAI. Just due to their pipeline and funding. I try and stay away from the smaller companies seeing as they have smaller product pipelines and more share dilution. Cmps(Compass Pathways) if you can get it for sub $31. They just had some good results from the largest psilocybin test to date, advancing to phase  III trial. Heavily invested into the sector with these guys and some other smaller cap companies. Only because I know this stuff works. 
  Not only have I personally experienced it, but I've seen the healing that these things, and only these things can bring. It's not managing symptoms, popping a pill to zone out. It's peeling back the ego which at the same time is protecting your precious psyche, also holds the irrational fears or anxiety that the average life brings day in and day out. Over multiple sessions you can get down and dirty with yourself and actually realize why you do what you do, why you feel the way you feel. And every so often you need to return for another cleanse. 
  You mix up enough liquid and handle enough 200g+ MDMA(83% gcms fed testing) rocks without burning your serotonin receptors out and far away, you really get to see the magic these substances do for the good of humanity. And you wonder why all these dumb mofos are hooked on crack and heroin bringing them down, when one can move forward. Die or move forward? I'll choose progress and love. 
 I like the stocks.

Probably in a nursing home since anyone below the age of 35 uses Bitcoin.
Buying gold made sense at the beginning of the pandemic, but that ship already sailed.   Now retail is expecting gold to takeoff because government is finally reporting high inflation.   It is too late, retail will buy from institutions looking to raise cash to invest in the next market cycle.

To TSLA retards saying Burry is dumb and lucky: His investing record is absolute GOAT tier. he beat the S&P massively every year through 2 bubble pops, both times everyone was screaming at him for years that he was an idiot. And both times he won massive payouts and is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. and you are clipping burger King coupons from the Sunday saver
lucky guy
I think it had more to do with him not being a retard.
He got destroyed on Tesla lost hundreds of millions and then stopped shorting. Now he’s allegedly working as a dish washer at a Taco Bell in Tuscan Arizona.
I like Burry but everyone in this game who wins, is just lucky.

Tesla call is always the play. Elon Musk already sold his stupid shares. Thank God no more bumpy market because of his stupidity
Yes sure. TSLA will eternally climb upwards. Infinite money hack.
Lol but seriously
but more seriously, it works till it doesnt
> TSLA will eternally climb upwards

I've profited from the climb from 1030-1215 at least 5 times this month.  It doesn't have to climb upwards eternally, just deliver reliable volatility at a low premium.

Agree. But I will deny this comments existence at 480
Holy shit im so glad i hedged my tsla put spread before close. Whew. 

Elon sold some stock monday so thats over with. Tsla back to 1200+ by next wk confirmed.
The sell out was from panic. He didn't even start lol
No, elon did sell. Check the afterhours news. He sold monday per sec filings.

Tsla popped afterhours because we know Elon sold $1.1 billion worth of stock. THIS IS CONFIRMED NOW.

BULLS IN SHAMBLES LMAO. FUTURES DEEP RED
deep red? only dow is like -.10%
Buddy has never heard of a weak open red to green
This is all such child’s play. I was around in March 2020 when we would be -5% premarket, open and instantly have a halt, then end the day -11%. Day after day. It was fun because I could sit around and drink all day while I watched my accounts go to zero. Fun times. Much more fun than bears desperately grasping at -0.5% pre market dips

WISH is done lol
Bought a $27c FD on $OPEN for Friday...
You mouseketeers crack me up
Throw more money at clov because its a habit now and I don't learn
Looks like SoFly about to make a huge bull run after earnings.
Stay down Mickey, stay down.
Listen I know people joke here and all and we have fun.

But being blunt it didn't make any sense to believe Disney beat earnings, no company pushing aggressively a ADDED loss leading stream platform IS UP on earnings. Hulu and Netflix are direct streaming companies, this changes expectations. The Push for Disney+ was just losing money for subs, money they brought in from other areas.

This should have been obvious but people seem to be uh... Stupid.

Remember when ATT a couple years ago owned like 2 cable and 4 streaming services and controlled 40% of the media including broadcast?

Remember they couldn't find a way to make money and sold a bunch of assets and spun off the rest to merge with discovery?

You guys should get how this works but now. I expect Disney to bleed the more they push products that don't make money.
WISH earnings posted, better than expected and a new CEO

How is GME going down on 0 volume after hours?
Incorrect reporting of volume
I don’t understand how one can fuck that up. I mean that determines the stock of the price
> I don’t understand how one can fuck that up.

They mean you, dummy. Volume isn’t zero.

> I mean that determines the stock of the price

Volume does not determine the price of a stock nor the “stock of the price”.
Mother fucker the volume on my chart is zero and it went down by like 3$.

Somebody check my math: Spy up .41 since close (2 hrs). 16.5 hrs between close and open. If spy maintains the same rate, we should be at 467.38 at open.

FTFY
More bullish than ever, imagine if Jackie becomes the new CEO. I believe WISH will see $10-15 soon enough
You think she’d take ceo right after signing on as cfo?
Depends on a lot of factors but if they are not able to find a better CEO then why not Jackie? She has an amazing track record. Also now as Piotr is out there are higher chances for a buyout, if it happens it will benefit us
Buying puts on spy smart? With futes going red I hope so
Future green tho
When I was a kid I went over to a friends house and he was building together those warhammer figures. The super glue he was using to glue the pieces was so strong it made me drowsy and felt so relaxed. I had to lay down it felt so good.

So i guess i should NOT have bought those 465c.

Looking for confirmation bias on the PENN 12/10 60 calls I doubled down on right before close. Any chance you fookers think we get a bounce in the next few weeks??
Dave is never gonna stop bringing attention to this situation, so probably no bounce. Just obliterating any future interest from partners down the road. Very clear he’s a liability vs. more buttoned up competition. Regardless of how true or false all the accusations are.

Anyone in $PENN?
I was, cut some losses today.  Not sure I see it improving in the short term.  It's been on a rough stretch well before this most recent earnings.
I switched to selling puts.  Got $21k of prem o/s at 55/56/58p level.  Great premiums.
You are absolutely going to hold PENN at the end of next week, but I wouldn't mind holding at these levels either.  Might dip and stay flat but who cares, lots of upside.

> The word gay was first used as an insult in the early 20th century. It was originally a way to describe someone who is "happy" or "carefree", but it evolved into being used as an insult for people with effeminate characteristics, and then expanded from there. The use of gay as a slur has been decreasing over time due to increased awareness about its negative connotations and pressure from social movements such as #GayIsOK

Here's one from London Stock Exchange. BOO  
It is a decent profitables business, to which market over-reacted on the news of reduced profit margin due to an increase in shipping costs. They have benefited hugely from the increased online sales - being an online based business, and acquired decent brands which could not keep up with the lockdown closures due to their rent payments on outlets. The revenue and the profit of BOO seems to consistently grow in the last few year. Hence, BOO seems to be in a decent place for growth, especially with the expansion into US and other markets.

SPY is at support right now in the bottom channel. I expect it to get in the middle or top channel very soon given nov/dec/jan are the most bullish months.
Hmm, but market looks weak for the past few days and seriously searching for good news. So, I feel another bad news can tank it again. Also, we have OpEx next week.
In my opinion it has been weak since China (country with 2nd largest GDP) could have gone into a financial reccesion till today.
Bulls clinging to futures for hope as clear evidence stacks against their thesis.
what index are you referring to? i\`m only in Tsla
CCL, carnival, will never recover ..... Holding long-term puts at 22.50. I'm sorry but nobody is fucking going on a cruise right now. Capital intensive, labor shortages, consumer net income declining, lingering fear of China Virus... Sad but true, the cruise industry will never recover
I think you’re wrong. We’ll see
I could be, but how will CCL justify a 27B market cap when it can't generate cash with all the capital it has to dump into running/building new ships that run this poorly. The vaccine isn't preventing any spread, look at Vermont, highest vax % and it's highest COVID rate right now...media not talking about it. Just seems absurd they lost billions this year and how will they recover?

Good riddance if so
Holding LEAPS puts when you could be holding calls on profitable companies…..
your puts are fucked my dude, that shit is already priced in
I was in San Diego last week... Big 'ole lineup to get on that Disney cruise ship. You underestimate old retired people with disposable income and nothing better to do.
The vaccines work and old people aren't working, they goin on cruises bro. Bring in the sanitized buffets
https://www.google.com/amp/s/news.yahoo.com/amphtml/highly-vaccinated-vermont-more-covid-152537112.html
I thought so too…. But my coworker went on 2 cruises this year and already booked 2 more for the next year. Try asking that dumb ass what a labor shortage is 🤡

I think once (if) covid will be thing of past and cruises reopen we’ll see bookings going 2-3 years in advance. All senior citizens who cruised before pandemic and were cramped in their homes for almost 2 years certainly will book double! 
Could go both ways…
Good points..  but I have seen how absurd the deals are, like buy one get 3 free... Kids free. Etc etc.. in an inflationary environment.. think how absurd it must be to stock those boats and keep the service decent.. must be a nightmare.
I hope tesla gets fukd up tomorrow 

Oh yeah 🐓
My balls are about to absolutely fuck your chin
puts on kyle rittenhouse, calls on his sentencing
Calls on self defense. Puts on Kenosha due to future fire damage.
Have you watched the trial? All the prosecutions witnesses are saying he was acting in self defense. Even the prosecutor looked shocked and depressed lol.
Nobody with these opinions have watched the trial.
i havent watched the trial but that incident was definitely not self defense everyone knows that
The guy who was shot but survived literally said he was shot only after he pulled out his gun and aimed it at Rittenhouse
He went to another state to allegedly defend a business that no one asked him to.
deserves life in prison + solitary confinement in a dark box for the first 30 years
Nah he killed some real dirt bags. Plus the one that survived already admitted to pointing an illegal gun at the boy. Lol your reddit circle jerks don't really work here we just care about money.

Lol you're a little slow aren't you?

I sold all my shitcorn when I got this gut feeling the other night ..stocks and coins... a co worker followed me with out discussing it with me after overhearing .. honestly felt like shit watching it kiss 68 today and the dive just made me feel so fucking good even after a bloody day
I just happened to switch it to a different corn 45 minutes before that dump. Waited a bit and cycled it back in. Super lucky timing
no one cares. take it to the corn sub.

It is literally up 0.01% at this moment.   It is essentially no movement.
Looks like he exercised his options at $6.24. 100% this sale was for tax purposes. And he did 10% of it. So maybe that's what he meant about selling 10%. It's a twitter poll, not some legal agreement.
So he sold 10% of the 10% needed so far? So 9 more red days is what I am hearing?
There's no "needed" for anything. He sold 10% like he said. Nothing is binding. I think that's all he's selling.
If I get platinum TSLA to 1250 next week!
Thought you guys were kidding about $GME 1k, but seeing 950Cs on the options chain is surreal. Even at $510. What the shit.
They've been showing up off and on since January. A lot of people use them for an IV play. Options have proven to be a pretty terrible idea with GME.
Ive made a good amount on then even after janaury.  But its risky.  Gotta buy fast and sell fast.  You aint holding it more than 30 mins.
That's probably the best way to go. I've done decent on some IV plays, but usually sell quickly like you said, and leave money on the table, but I'm good with it. I've also done decent with CSP's assuming strong $170 support.

Better to just not invest at all then. I guess I should just leave the market entirely. See how stupid that sounds? That’s how stupid you sound.

No one gives a fuck. Take that shit to a political sub.
“Often times people will latch onto ideologies and beliefs when the feel helpless or without control. Usually these feelings stem from their own lives but they will project them outward in order to disassociate. Because they do not truly believe these mental constructions, they tend to be in a constant state of projection. This allows them to focus on their singular beliefs without having to think critically about them or competing beliefs. These false beliefs are unstable, and need constant mental support in order to not fall apart. Therefor, the disillusioned individual will incorporate it into every aspect of their life, often associating it with things that are unrelated.”

I paid for em. So fuck off
So you are a socialist?
Because i pay a shitload of taxes?
Yeah if you use them because you paid for them off taxes, that’s socialism. What part do I need to help you with?
What does socialism have to do with anything? Lol wtf. We run a deficit. You think paying that down does something? Embrace debt. Have faith in America.
Oh you need a lot more explained to you than I signed up for. Ain’t nobody got time for that.
Id be happy to school you.
On how to simp for a billionaire instead of your fellow man? You sound like a fucking clown dude.
If only you understood how it hurts the working class to force a particular billionaire to sell a stake in his company. Its actually counter productive to what you think you will accomplish. First he is cash poor. The reason for that is because his "money" is tied to the theoretical value of his company. Second losing control of that company through forced sales leaves room for hostile takeovers or fraudulent shareholder votes that favor their big oil or short funds. Forcing taxes on unrealized gains also has an unintended consequence of taking growth companies out of public markets. The same growth companies that generate growth in 401ks for working peoples retirements. Not to mention that Tesla employs thousands of people for good pay. Youve probably never slept rough or had to dig in the couch for pennies to buy a double cheeseburger like me so i dont expect your fake ass crust punk ideology to understand the levers you pull may be the one that drops you. Your ignorance has lead you to target a billionaire who is actually doing good instead of doing some research on billionaires youve never heard of keeping all their money offshore doing nothing. You are your own enemy and youre too dumb to realize it.

Lol. You don't know what you're talking about. And showing a single chart means absolutely nothing. 

First, that screengrab is from when? Market open?

Spy is 463.85 currently. It is not going to ATH in two days. It's been way overbought all month long. We will have a green day or even two over the next couple weeks. But this thing is going down more.
You don’t know what you’re talking about. Good luck with puts in one of the most bullish months. The screenshot is old but the trend is there.
Put your money where your mouth is. Make a banbet for spy 475 by Friday. Cmon go ahead.

I have made 40% on puts this week. I'm doing just fine. And I'll get back into calls when this thing has actually bottomed out. It's still way overbought and I'll make way more on an actual recovery.
Don’t think so….. I’ll bet you a Big Mac

spy went +16% in the 30s
For real- anyone around here to speak about the inflation in the 70s? Curious what it is what like during the Carter years
> The inflation in the 70s was caused by a combination of factors. The first factor is that there were high oil prices and OPEC raised the price of oil from $3 to $12 per barrel between 1973 and 1974, which led to an increase in gasoline prices at home. Another reason for this inflationary period was due to wage increases as well as government spending on social programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, food stamps etc..

Is VM a sassy Wall Street insider that actually knows what he’s talking about?
I looked down on AFRM because the Buy Now Pay Later field is crowded but I’m seeing their logo everywhere now. I’m going to buy in if it dips again.
rest of the world has been on BNPL for ages, before companies like AFRM
I agree that AFRM isn't necessarily "new" but it's their partnerships with a lot of retailers that makes them special/competitive IMO.
absolutely agree with you. if disney was smart they would partner.

You're not even good at it.
And boom goes the dynamite.
*doubles down on small-cap bio-tech*
SRNEEEEEEEE
!!! That’s one of my positions. Atossa + Atreca in there too.
I doubled down on it on Thursday, and then Pfizer drop kicked us into a ditch on Friday. Still bullish about it but it's been very irritating as a play.
Translation: doubles down on spreading bullshit
How is this spreading bullshit? Post your losses and get off my case
Uh oh! Someone mad their little P&D isn’t working? 🥺
Noooo earnings for a lot of bio-pharma is expected within next week. so I put some more money into it (?) and are you suggesting ONE Reddit user is attempting a P&D whilst not even listing a specific company? Yeah you’re new-new here
So go ahead and post the ticker then 😂
I needn’t do that, because it was never my intent to promote anything or anyone (?) get help son
Post. The. Ticker. Then.

We both know which one you were taking about 😉
got the idea for the play but need your to help guys.  
due to shit at the Poland border. Eu Gonna ban Russian airline to deal with EU. In relation the Russia gonna ban Eu airlines flying over Russia. That shit gonna cost lot to Airlines as russia is big. So question. which airlines fly most from Europe to the east? as its a good put play.

Is anyone considering earnings play on baba ? Looks like 170 is an easy mark to hit in a week

The market should be open only 1 hour out of the week but that 1 hour period changes every week and it's not pre-announced so you have to be on the watch 24/7 to catch that one hour of window.
You are dumb. You are really dumb.
I'm shocked you can spell the word "dumb" without looking at a dictionary. But then again it's your middle name.
My middle name is Paul. You are a dumb idiot with a birth defect. I hope you get purged idiot

You *really* love being cucked by insiders don't you
So, I’m down bad this week. Full disclosure. And I regret voting yes on the Elon poll just to stick it to the smug Tesla sucking fucks who barraged this place the last two weeks. But hindsight is 20/20. 

What I love though, is seeing all the bears going all, “But, but, but, it’s only (insert percentage here) of his Twitter poll! But, but, but, fools thinking this is good news! But, but, but, Twitter poll!!!!”

As if that shit is legally binding. 

As if 10% couldn’t be 10% of his options. 

As if the report doesn’t count days since filed. 

AS IF NOTHING COULD BE TRUE, SHORT OF THE CEO OF A COMPANY TANKING HIS GOD DAMN SHARE PRICE AND FUCKING HIS SHAREHOLDERS FOR A TWITTER POLL.

I truly love to see it. And for me, Tesla is like GME, I don’t touch that shit.

Fuck your puts, bitches. 

The week I learned to hate fucking 🌈 🐻’s and love the bomb.
Im long Tesla and a die hard Tesla bull and i voted yes. I also had my family vote yes. Wanna know why? Because i wanted to give bears hope and then take it from them.
> I'm a little confused. You were hoping to give bears hope and then take it from them?
Are you following me? Is this because i took the vaccine? Are you the microchip?
> I am not the microchip.
My man. You’re one of those Tesla fuckers I like.
Haha
So just so I understand…you are one of the retards who voted Yes when you don’t own any TSLA just because you are jealous of those of us who do own it?
Yep. 

And no. 

Not jealous, just got sick of the smug “NeVeR bEt AgAiNsT tEsLa!!!!” unsufferable bullshit you guys tend to flood the zone with when you’re up on an extremely overvalued stock, as if it’s remotely realistic. 

When you’re legitimately trying to justify that stock price and valuation as reasonable, you need a punch in the face. 

Just didn’t think about the fact I’d be taking one too.

I don't disagree and I think we demand better, but I won't deny we are trying very hard to do good.
We can’t fight everyone’s battles for them.  Eventually the native people will have to WANT to fight for their own country, or get conquered.  It’s been that way since the dawn of man, and still is that way.  Case in point — Afghanistan.

So many idiots in the comments who obviously dick ride and don't read shit for themselves. The man hasn't sold all 10% yet. IF he did we would know by looking at the daily volume for the last 3 days. Fuckin retards. Hes doing it slowly so the price doesn't tank too hard. That way he can get max gains at top per transaction, prolly buys puts, slowly sells off makes money on the way down too, and then chills buys calls,  lets WSB eat the dip lets the price go back up and sell more rinse and repeat. That way hes selling each share for the most value without dumping the share price too hard and hes leaving yall holding the bag lol. best of both worlds. 5 x 1050P  11/19
Someone is upset
i mean if ur bullish that hes selling 10% at ath levels then ok lol. But he aint done selling so keep buying his bag
So don’t buy Tesla if you are worried bro lol. Why the emotional event?
because i have a lot of money into it lol
Actually he sold. Sorry. The paper work is filed with sec.
ya sold some lol

DWAC, people are sick and tired of censorship from big tech and Trumps new social media platform might 🚀
Because that logic worked so well for Parler, Gab, and Gettr. 

Hosting these social networks and advertising on them are liabilities, and reactionaries get bored with the echo chamber after a while anyway. 

Politics aside, it’s a shitty business model, which is why it’s failed every time it’s been tried.
Uhhh Lets go Brandon song beat Adele on ITunes downloads and there are hella advertisers. Trump is suing Twitter, Facebook, and Google-owned YouTube in a series of class-action lawsuits that can decimate the colossal censorship regime of Big Tech. Parler couldn’t handle the fight with Apple, so they caved. Trump has the resources they didn’t have.
What does a song being popular on iTunes have to do with anything? Lmao. 

The fact that Parler had to cave illustrates my point: Particularly after January 6th, associations with alt-tech have become poisonous for web hosting companies, and other such mainstream tech operations. 

A social media company cannot thrive if they’re under constant threat of being removed by their host. 

And again, social media outlets rely on ad revenue. Who, other than MyPillow, will want to have their brand associated with far-right insurrectionists? 

The irony is that alt-tech NEEDS the very mainstream companies they despise, and that’s why this will never work. 

It will be a nice honeypot for the federal government though, for sure.
Delisted in a year

Cause: Securities Fraud
anything that 🥭 subhuman illiterate touches burns to the ground and goes bankrupt, so I'm gonna say puts on that trash
If you don’t spew hate speech, you usually aren’t censored. Lol
He was fucking funny, I miss Trump on Twitter 😩

Kyle bass should serve as a lesson to anyone who trades on emotion and blinding bias. Idiot literally thought he could short the city of Hong Kong based on nothing and get away with it using racist FUD. He has lost all of his money and his investors, he is down -99% on over 300 million. One by one the racists will fall, once soros and Weiss are wiped out we will never have these Chinese FUD storms we get every few years ever again. One down, just a few more to go. God is good, blind justice is being dispensed on blind men.

Tomorrow….am I right? Upvote if You agree downvote if I’m fukt
bruh even if Tesla dips 10% back to back you're still not ITM by expiry lmao (assuming it's a weekly)
Do you understand the concept that it doesn’t have to be in the money to sell for profit? Even just one 10% dip would make hella profit even if it’s still far away from being in the money. It expires next week not this friday.
I just assumed it's a weekly (cause like 99% of the sub plays weeklies) so theta decay would've massacred it regardless, hence why I was concerned about it getting ITM to salvage it.

But since its got 9dte and not 2, better chance of it profiting than not. I don't think TSLA holds 1070
Oh I see yeah with theta burn on a weekly it would have to be in the money to break even or profit i wasn’t thinking about that my bad what you said makes sense now
Given the extremely high IV it needs to be a sharp decline for it to make any sort of profit
This is our concern, dude
It is very much a concern alright...
Tomorrow will be easily down -2%.

Is opex even a real thing? Is it historically bad? I think its a lie to bring the working man down tbh
> Yes, it is a real thing. It's an acronym for "operational expense." Opex is the total amount of money spent on expenses that are not directly tied to revenue generation. For example, advertising and salaries would be considered opex since they do not directly increase sales or profits but still need to be paid for in order to run a business.

There was a big move in the 467 range today that will probably serve as resistance going forward

I guess I'm loading a bunch of call options of gold miners tomorrow.
Rip postmark and purple
I'm so dumb. I almost pulled the trigger on bynd puts and affirm calls but instead I play GEVO to go down violently because I'd make more.

Anyways tapestry calls at open.
If you're in shares instead of options it's not too late to get HUT shares, leak came out saying it's a beat. Only question is how much.

Grabbed 100 myself just now, along with my 20 $16 options. We are a go.

are there any platforms that actively allow you to filter for recent movers by the minute/15minute/hour interval etc, or filter based on earnings today, that sort of thing? with a good ui?
Webull let's you filter High flyers and Low bois, in AH last 5 min, Day everything
Webull has this for the overall market on its main page well 5 minute movers and activity and a premarket/after hours movers and I believe it to have the nicest interface personally. If you decide you may sign up let me know.

Y’all mind if I turn up the speed on my treadmill incline walk? 👀
Woof today was brutal. Bought nvda and amd the entire way down.  Ended up with a lot of unrealized losses today... hoping for a quick recovery
Unrealized losses?
Yeah had to take some to shift around positions but I've got a few weeks for things to rocket back up... we'll see   A lot of nvda hope for earnings - and I haven't had great luck with earnings this year.

MRVI kills earnings, get in before the run back to $60+
Evergrande I don’t think defaulted no reliable sources on the matter…
There are no "reliable" sources anywhere on anything anymore. 

Everyone is full of shit. Evergrande definitely fuk tho
only reliable thing i saw was a reuters article that says they have payment due today that hasn’t been paid yet

but no word on total default
Shit you're right. Fucking news outlets these days.
https://www.reuters.com/business/investors-await-evergrandes-overdue-148-mln-payment-amid-contagion-fears-2021-11-09/

Its schrodinger's disaster.  It has both happened and not happened until someone connected finally goes GUH
Can anyone tell me the latest short interest on MQ? thanks
So how we feelin on affirms earnings?
Personally feeling pretty good. Active merchants increase gave me a boner.

I was so upset today seeing opendoor down almost 10% since I bought yesterday cuz I had a good feeling about earnings. AND I WAS FUCKING RIGHT BABY!  WE UP 15% AH WOOOOHOOOOO

The thing is that everything is so fucking expensive, but company's earnings are mostly still bad, cuz their production costs are through the roof and consumers are discouraged to spend (due to higher prices). We are in some fucked up spiral, where no one wins.

My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

Is anyone here an investor in Kura Sushi?
No whats that
A publicy traded sushi company.
That's cool. I love sushi. I eat it like over 6 times a month. Why are you bullish on the company?
I am currently researching them. It is conveyor belt sushi chain. In short, what caught my eye is that they are increasing revenue and expanding in the U.S in times, when the overall restaurant industry is doing pretty bad. Also their way of operations is very popular in Japan, but kinda new for the U.S, however customers seems to love it. Sadly, I am not from the U.S so I am unable to test their services by myself.
Interesting. I'll look into them. Are they profitable? Most sushi places here are small, intimate places
Not yet. They are prioritising growth. I am still not sure if I will invest in them, but it is worth it to check them out.
Used to be.. sold it at like $15.
Oh, you missed on some substantial gains.
Yeah I liked the stock but I read too many Yelp reviews that trashed it.

Not much DD on VAXX. I dug around and found they are working with peptides, which I have researched and used personally with great benefits. Peptides are naturally occurring amino acid chains. And I'm not talking about wrinkle cream here. I used bpc157 injections to heal a tendon injury that DRs said was basically damaged forever. The list of peptides and uses is just being researched in the US. Lots of data from Russia.

Money is everything. Every place and thing on Earth has an appraisal of value with ever changing worth. The beauty of money is money never betrayed you. Money never stole from you.  Money will buy you everything you ever wanted and take you anywhere you want to go. Money gave you confidence. Money gave you comfort. Money bought you a place in the world. Money made you a winner. Money made you an owner. Money gave you a ride. Money gave you an opportunity. Money gave you a voice. Money gave you freedom to be yourself. If ever you were alone money would be there for you. Love money more than your children because money buys happiness because happiness is the ability to make possibilities happen. Or was it God?

The CEO the face of TSLA selling his stocks? How the fuck is that not bearish? What the fuck is he saying about his company? This is the beginning
He's exercising options, too. He's coming out of this with more shares.
Y r ppl so fucking retarded
Ulterior motives.
Yep just waiting to smear
It was bearish for like 2 days
Yeah but now it's confirm he sold.... the man Is losing interest on TSLA
Not even close to the reason why he sold. The WSJ wrote an entire article today. You can look at his filing with the SEC. it was a sale he had planned in September
I have a put to sell you.
[deleted]
> Correct.
It’s not bearish cause every CEO cashes out stocks for tax or paying themselves. He also gave us a heads up so the last few days was priced in causing the downtrend and Elon Musk actually selling his shares we now know he sold from Mon-Wed on the SEC filing. Now that’s out the way it’ll continue the uptrend. Simple.
It's ELON he doesn't suppose to give a damn. Him and his brother selling is not good
You gotta think. This sale was already planned since September. But watch the stock price yourself next 2 weeks. Will be 1200+

How to do WSB and be smart and retarded:

Put 20% of your money in funds to have fun with, AKA risky calls and such 

I’m a separate broker, put 80% of your money in smart stock plays or leaps.
I'm amazed at how retarded the downvotes and replies to my last comment are considering it's 5am. Usually smart people are waking up and retards are asleep by now.

Downvoting me won't change the fact that if you're so fucking stupid you thought I was defending a murderer, you have NO chance of being a successful trader by anything but luck.
Bro, do you even live in the state where this is happening? Who the fuck cares. It has 0 effect on you and me. Stop fixating on things that have small returns! Or you’ll never be a successful trader (of life)
Imagine being so fucking retarded your brain doesn't even have the capacity to care about everything or think about everything so you have to selectively ignore important topics or you'll be fucked trying to comprehend other ones
time and place, this ain't it
How do you figure, you fucking retard?
this is an options forum, not your twitter feed you dummy
So? How the fuck do you get from that to "this isn't the place to talk about stuff" you fucking retard? What does my Twitter feed even have to do with it?
Holy shit you are dull. I mean no one cares about your opinions on shit that isn't related to the stock market on a sub that is literally only about options trading. People's twitter feed is usually where they post their shitty opinions. Your reading comprehension is lacking. Hope you make money today even though you are a miserable piece of shit
> I mean no one cares about your opinions on shit that isn't related to the stock market on a sub that is literally only about options trading. 

What sub is that and what the fuck does it have to do with the context here you fucking retard?

> People's twitter feed is usually where they post their shitty opinions.

And? What the fuck made you think of that at this time?

> Your reading comprehension is lacking. 

Then use extremely basic English

> Hope you make money today even though you are a miserable piece of shit

I hope you don't make money today unless I really do have bad reading comprehension and you prove it by using smaller words to make your point understandable for me
Enjoy being miserable, well adjusted people don't act like you do. I'm done here
What the fuck is a "well adjusted" person? How can adjusting a human be done well you fucking retard?
Your time and attention are finite. You can never focus on everything.

“We have two lives, and the second begins when we realize we only have one.”

I bet if you didn’t know whatever issue your talking about was happening, your life would be pretty much 100% the same. The only change would be the fact that you have the opportunity to focus on something that could improve you life instead.
Your time and attention are finite, but your senses aren't? You're omniscient, exposed to all the stimulus in the universe at once, so you have to selectively ignore most of it and get it down to one human perspective in order to function?

That's weird bro. My eyes and ears only work within certain distances and stuff, I think for most of us the problem is not being able to see and hear the whole world at once, not that we have to ignore stuff and struggle to process what we're aware of in order for our senses to work at all against all the overwhelming stuff out there. You should see if there's some surgery you could get to remove your third eye or whatever and be normal, it's really nice to have senses and a brain tuned by millions of years of evolution to be balanced for each other's capacities so that you can pay attention to every important thing you come across. I don't think your brain is adapted to cope with the conditions you describe.
Psst, I think you got the word finite and infinite mixed up 😄
Are you so fucking retarded you just tried to gaslight me about basic English, or even more retarded than that?
Pretty sure at this point you’ve gaslit yourself. You seem confused!
I genuinely wonder which one is the answer
I think if you explain your previous non sequitur, it would shine a lot of light on the issue
Well, you said I was confusing "finite" with "infinite" when I obviously wasn't, implying you're so fucking retarded you don't know what "finite" and "infinite" mean. However, that would be unusually retarded, and there's another possibility that you just don't know it's unusual for any options trader to be so retarded they'd struggle with that vocabulary, and you haven't caught on to who I am yet, so you thought I'd somehow be confused by you getting the words backwards. While still pretty retarded, it's pretty common for retards to think they can gaslight me with extremely retarded shit, so this wouldn't be so unusual. Thus, I figured I'd ask if you were trying to gaslight me, or like, so retarded you weren't even trying to gaslight me, which would be crazy.
Did your dog die? Bought puts at close yesterday? you good bro?
Females hurt me so much it broke me emotionally and made my life pointless for me but my dumbass species that fucked up the composition of the atmosphere is the only one I know of with the intelligence to potentially fix the composition of the atmosphere and I'm either the only or one of the only ones in my species with the mental health to be able to use that intelligence so I can't kill myself or the whole biosphere might go down with me.

It fucking sucks. I'm constantly angry.
Am I really the only girl on here? I am 18 with big perky tits and soo horny. hehe
> Yes, you are the only girl on WallStreetBets.
Bots are a wonderful part of wsb. Go further FASTER with bots.

Single is better than a relationship. I rather blow my money on 0dte than a date.
Cool thirsty story bro
WSB logic: “fuck TA, I’ll make more money betting against the trend on a ETF”

Me: Does TA, concludes $520 EOY PT, looks at 515C 12/31 OI of 30,000 & 520C 12/31 OI of 10,000 & gets even more confident by inversing the sub
[Right here...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYc6QmaGnYc)
Just lost atleast 50 IQ points watching that lol
> [Right here...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYc6QmaGnYc)
This sub says 500 EOY. You buying 515C might pay off but its pushing it holy shit.
https://ibb.co/dBqtBwt

Don’t think I am here
I got the same lines drawn with crayons in my notebook.   I am just saying, 515C is pushing it.  Most likely people are buying 515C and selling 520C as some kind of hedge in the circumstance of a parabolic move. Or vise versa if they are bearish.

I mean I hope we get that high but there is a lot of risk associated with that move, given Inflation, Evergrande, etc.
Agreed. I am playing these plays instead. Is it just me or did you notice the market loss momentum ever since Evergrande? Tomorrow and moving forward should put us back on track.

https://ibb.co/z8scfVy
I am also hoping for a major bull run. Buying 515C and holding though.... I would more buy those anticipating a huge 3 day bull run and selling at a 300% profit.  Most likely the market will forget about Evergrand and inflation by next week. Hoping for a few more dips this week to load up on slightly OTM calls.

I love your plays I hope they hit. Don't forget you turn them in calendar spreads later if you want to try to collect some theta in the meantime.
Thanks man, lots of studying & paying like 13K tuition learning. I can’t wait for the day when all of the hard work pays off. If we dip, I just keep buying more contracts & hold.
> Yeah, I'm not sure what's going on.
Considering China isn’t going into a financial recession it should be a major bull run till late Jan.
This is the shittiest fucking TA I’ve ever seen
Go ahead & upload your ACT 5 score version then
? Lol I took that like 6 years ago. Got a 31 not sure why that matters
Put your money where your mouth is, upload your TA.
Sometimes you just open the chart and see things. I wouldn’t rely so heavily on one chart. Market looks in need of a correction I think it’s pretty obvious. Sharp and fast hopefully.

Hey guys/gals, we got a virologist / infectious disease MD here!! Fuck off cunt.

talk abount OOTM, those must be cents on the dollar per contract. id fuck with it.
Facts gonna rollover my 500/530s into these in the feb dip.

https://ibb.co/dBqtBwt
Vaxed also carry/transmit virus. Viruses are always mutating.  If something doesn't kill a virus like traditional vaccine (covid jabs are technically drugs, not vaccines), eventually there will be even stronger strain that will bypass covid jabs. 

I'd say we mandate healthy lifestyle, and ban junk food. Because it's not pandemic of unvaccinated - it's pandemic of obese.
People are broke bc no stimmy & job # are still no where near to pre covid levels with delta strain being an issue.

Calls on Biden passing stimmy.
Covid isn't the issue. Its the fools who believe the MSM
It is according to the fed
The is not to be trusted. they don't care about you or me. all bs lies
Then why they pass multiple stimmy
Nothing is free my friend. just ask that 10$ gallon of milk. That 5$ gallon of gas etc. Read down the rabbit hole
If we can’t have a bull market without a stimmy we don’t deserve a bull market. And that’s coming from someone who basically blew up their whole folio with calls today, not some 🌈🐻

Money will buy you everything you ever wanted and take you anywhere you want to go. Money gave you confidence. Money gave you comfort. Money bought you a place in the world. Money made you a winner. Money made you an owner. Money gave you a ride. Money gave you an opportunity. Money gave you a voice. Money gave you freedom to be yourself. If ever you were alone money would be there for you. Love money more than your children because money buys happiness because happiness is the ability to make possibilities happen. Or was it God?

Silver is getting real close to where it was last year when it jumped up considerably. If it gets above 25-26 (slv) it’s liable to have a decent spike. Fair warning they are fast:)
you're dumb lol

Agreed. I used to buy *precious* metals when my balls were locked up in the closet and I was so fat I couldn't fuck a prostitute.
So market tanks all day, news about evergrande daunting circulates afterwards?? Seems like some people know something others don't?
evergrande is already price in.

Inflation is so 2020-2021.   What should I buy for 2022?
Consumer staples. People will still buy them cuz they have too. They’ve been lagging tech so far and because inflation concerns I can see them taking off in the next year because they will be the safe money.
Well, it’s not going away next year.

eventually, I think people might say discounted future cash flows, inflation, yadda-yadda-yadda.  I have to buy those ridiculously valued growth stocks so I can keep up with the gas bill.

ROOT rocketed on better than expected earnings.  +13% AH.  It has over 50% short interest.  I know a lot if you hate on this one, but it could be huge if the volume is there.

I love this stock. Everything it get popular my puts always print

I sold for +20% 🙄
Bought puts on AMD Monday got totally wrecked but held onto em and now here we are today that was a close one lol
Hope you don’t still have them…
I actually did the same thing but paper handed yesterday with a tiny profit.
I looked at my phone 15 min later down 100% so I just said fuck what else do I have to lose
I hope you hang yourself
Ahah trust I would have Monday I went -100% in about 15 min
good I bought AMD calls yesterday
I didnt I think it can reach 130-135 tomorrow and then find a nice bounce
reword that
ROOT BABYYYY
I've only been casually following this one since that guy did some DD a few months ago. Nice movement in the AH, congrats.

ROOT beat earnings should be $10 a share.  Heavily shorted.  Low float.  High short interest.  Everything you want for a epic squeeze.
If everyone here tweeted Elon and asked if he eats wendys, would he reply?

Anyone onboard with the SAVA squeeze ? A couple friends have talked to me about it but i was wondering if others know about it?
Missed a $20 to $3k move on that by one week.
It's active. Been rolling calls every week for the past 3. Made $2k off $25 last week. I just keep rolling weeklies to adjustment in price. It has potential In squeeze. They also have a Alzheimer's conference in Boston this week which they are sharing recent data on there drug for AD. 

If you have the stomach for the risk to rewards hop in for the ride. Hedges are spreading fake news about their research so they can successfully short but I personally don't think it will work for any longer.
took all these RBLX profits and went back all in COIN today

Honestly with that inflation data it seems we didn't lower at all.

Goodbye, night thread.
Oh rip
Im not in the investing mode right now. Trading is the game right now.
True. I'm gonna put most of the money into $dos prolly. Options will be leaps, small percentage of that money will be risky but not straight retarded shit
Hahaha thank you! Can you guys recommend a good starting place for me to learn all these terminologies, been lurking in this sub for years and I finally wanna get involved
He's a boomer perv
Sound logic. But buying a call is not opposite of buying a put. Opposite is selling put.
My prediction is I will lose on both calls and puts no matter what.

But if I can just hit one time I'll still feel like a winner
I'm straight thank you very much
Same, hoping for a open dip
Famn should held over night I guess. Oh well.
446c, 447c and 450c today is gonna be good that‚Äôs a big run up!

is there any way to prove that any of these "squeezes" are happening?
You're probably in the wrong sub.  This is a gambling aub.  You need /r/investing
I can‚Äôt wait to send a call/put spread deep OTM ($100) for AMZN earnings. I was too retarded in the past, legit free money. One will print.

i wouldn't buy way otm. gme is already sketchy af, i wouldn't buy the options that have the easiest to manipulate prices. YMMV  


EDIT: holy shit how is there 25k volume for 950 strike calls lmao
Seems more likely tbh.
Iv crush buying puts. Smart

If you receive more than $600 per year in zelle, PayPal, square, etc then they will file a 1099-K for you. Be prepared to prove your cost basis and if that money was not income. If you live with roommates I suggest finding a different solution for rent payments such as a cashiers check.
It's actually a good thing for you.  Just observe and watch people blow up their portfolios daily.  Meanwhile you're safe!
GUH! üòÇ 

JK. Godspeed TSLA will either take everything higher or crash them
So like I have 150k coming in by like a month from now, 65k of which is going to me so my question is what should I do with the money? I just got into options.
We go all time high then crash.. rinse n repeat 20 years

But how do u perfect time it??
&gt; I think Tesla will dip after earnings. I am buying calls.
Will TSLA dump or rocket after earnings?

Personally thinking things are priced in and we will see a dip.

At which point I‚Äôm buying calls.
It will. You see the 3.12 mil buy order at noon yesterday? Spy will moon
Thank you, turns out I can‚Äôt trade that from the UK which sucks
Nah. SPY to the üåù

Hi sorry I am a noob trying to learn, what is SPY? (I‚Äôm from the UK)
Oh for sure earnings aren‚Äôt due til early November anyway - I was thinking it‚Äôll get up to $350ish, what makes you so confident in it reaching $500?
$NET, $WMT, $NVDA, &amp; $FCEL üöÄüè¶

What do you guys think is the best way to play gme options with the assumption that another push to 250-350 will occur 1-2 weeks before December 6th earnings? As you all know the Implied volatility is at the 0 percentile so out of the money options can be very profitable if there is an IV ramp. Keeping in mind a large portion of profit in the path was from holding over night options and gaping up it seems like something too far out of the money can be hurtful since you lose your gains by holding. I'm in mind to buy 3 ranges of options while saving 1/3rd of my capital for the day trade of when this breaks out up, 1/3rd for 2-3week out options around 200-250 strike price, and possibly 1/3rd in January 950 strike calls for the potential IV ramp up. Entering these trades at the optimal time is just as important so from what i'm seeing on the chart with the bullish signal the optimal time to buy would be towards the end of October / next week. By spreading out the options with different strikes and expiration dates i'm hoping to catch as much of the coming push as possible. Let me know what you guys think.
Dont know what fucking casino youre going to lol
OTLY 25% short interest worth looking into?
I already trimmed some, now hoping that it will dump after er as it did after every good numbers to buy back

You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
!banbet SPY 100 1d
i‚Äôm a bull but i‚Äôd like a dump so i can buy more calls. took profits yesterday
you be crazy to think spy is going to go apeshit b4 November. everyone here's all high on green so they don't realize this is not a normal earnings month. No one here was even talking about earnings when we were dumping. earlier in the month
Mark Minervini is my dad
most games at the casino have you just barely losing money, options will take it all
I said 2.5 by Wednesday. So I‚Äôm right on track with my predictions
Seems to happen like once a month. I think I end up looping around somehow.
Being a bear in a melt-up is like dumping your money to chimney fire.
% returns?
is ROOT worth playing at this price? big OI for 11/19 7.5c‚Äôs

Fell asleep at 10:30, something woke me up at 11 which led to off and on sleep until 3 and then accepted I wasn't falling asleep again at 4:30. Idgi either, I had a good workout and was exhausted at 9 yesterday and then suddenly my body is like yea you don't need sleep
[deleted]
Seems like a likely prediction.
Not a bad call
First, sorry it took me a second, I had to look back through my notifs. Second, I never claimed I "made bank" on those 436p, I did make little money on them after bringing my avg down though. Third, you stated "Oh I hope that dumbass 'insert my user' sold those 436p like I said". Fourth, I said "we still have 5 hours and 39 minutes left"- and guess what? Spy did fall to 435 before EOD. You were wrong I was right, which I stated by re-commenting "hey u/Thick-Acanthaceae-59 you remember this-plugging your comment about me being a dumbass-? Fifth, in conclusion, I never said I made bank, just a little bit. You got mad that you predicted wrong and I made a joke which got a little attention so you tried to turn it into something it's not. Go touch grass man, it's healthy for you.
I‚Äôve literally made more money playing baccarat at the casino than I have with options

&gt;tsla

What Gary posted about not buying pm was nonsense 

His own PT is $1200, how can you not buy a stock at $850 (when he tweeted that) if your 6 month PT is 40% upside? I smell something fishy there, not sure if he sold covered calls again which he used to every week in the past
Unlike in other parts of the world, Stock market heavily manipulated and deregulated in America. That being said, you can try investing in faang, or sp500 companies. They almost always outperform in the long run. Having some cash on hand right now is a good strategy too to hedge against any collapse or large correction. Fb and apple had selloffs in the last month.  Semiconductors is another one you wanna keep an eye on.

If you ask me apple made a stupid move just like the iPhone 13.

You spelt Dicks wrong dude ü§∑
I suspect China would literally liquify half their population before allowing the economy to entirely crash. That was the whole point of ghost cities... China literally didn't give a fuck. Growth was needed, and they created it. It didn't matter that the whole house of cards was long term insolvent because the plan has always been to let the assholes running the charade hold the bag for a bit before restructuring their economy to benefit in some other way. Ghost city didn't become the big magnet for rural zone population that you hoped it would? Cool, that just means more work and more work means more growth.

We pretend that the Capitalist part of China is in control. In truth, they're playing in a heavily Statist managed system where anything that happens basically happens because the state tolerates it. This is one of the reasons I'm not as concerned about China crashing as many. I think they very well could crash, and it's not that I agree with Statism... I don't, but I do believe that the Chinese government doesn't care about anyone's sense of the rules of capital systems.

This isn't really a good reason to devote much investment capital to China, IMO... as that's a pretty big gamble in a system that can completely change on a whim. I suppose it depends on goals and risk tolerance, but I do think it's important to consider that China doesn't operate on Western economic rules before assuming that anything happening there will fit the kind of pattern that happens here.

Wine drunk, eat the pussy sloppy, use fingers to rub around her butthole, then hold your pointer finger on the hole gently until it puckers around your finger. Advance slowly, preferably while still eating pussy. Once you get your whole finger inside, pull all the way back out, and repeat the whole finger on the hole until it puckers thing, (it‚Äôs gonna happen faster) this time with your middle finger. By this point, you just gotta talk to her, if she likes it, just keep advancing slowly, and if she doesn‚Äôt, get a mistress.

There are some things in life that give a really high ROI in terms of happiness. For example, if you're passionate about reading books, you shouldn't be denying yourself the experience of book-shopping so that you can be a millionaire sooner.

Spending $20 book-shopping every month now will give a bigger boost to your lifetime happiness than spending $0/month now and $100/month when you're rich. There are diminishing returns. 

For another example: Going out to eat at Chipotle costs $10 and makes you feel good. A steakhouse costs $30 and makes you feel great. A Michelin star restaurant costs $100 and makes you feel great and also sophisticated. 

It's not worth it to avoid eating Chipotle when you're 20 so that you can go to Michelin star restaurants instead of steakhouses when you're 40. Just go to regular steakhouses. No need to be miserable as a 20 year old to feel sophisticated as a 40 year old.

Why is the GME subreddit excited about the SEC report? Did none of them read it at all? It clearly states no evidence was found of naked shorting or fake shares, all FTD nonsense is false, their research showed nothing extraordinary regarding FTD and the SEC Report shows most shorts covered. There was 5x the total shares in trading volume over the 3 days leading GME to $400. So even if not all shorts covered, at least 80% did as current short interest hovers between 10-20%. Wtf did these guys read that state otherwise because everything in that SEC report says they‚Äôre wrong. No fake shares, plenty of volume to close shorts, no FTD nonsense.

The market just needs to see the earnings and team as this new public company that‚Äôs twice the size of a competitor in fresh produce and valued several turns below their comp set.

Lifestyle in Colorado is much healthier and easier. Weather is better than Chicago. In NYC you can be from wherever and no one bats an eye. I found Chicago to have an undercurrent racism that surprised me, and when I ever brought it up, everyone just said eh it is Midwest. Colorado I found to be more open minded and people easier to deal with. I was part owner of a bar there for a few years.

the 3% down payment isn't really the issue here at all. The problem was that mortage companies were doing no-doc/"liar loans" where your mortage officer would literally tell you to exaggerate the fuck out of your incomes and would not check any of your info. They knew you couldn't afford the mortgage, but their company didn't care because they were going to bundle it with a ton of other risky ass mortgages and sell it to someone else in a month or two so it wasn't going to be their problem anymore. Plus people were still getting hosed with ARMs back then as well.

Not really, 3% downpayments are common now and they have been for a long time. Think of PMI as rent premium you'd pay anyways. The mean downpayment is 12%.

the thing is, its not a matter of if you buy a house but when. and when you do, theres so much costs and adds up a lot. (if u buy a house that needs repairs, that is.) example: flood in basement- probably have to get a shop vac, new flooring, moldings, etc... or new roof- sheesh the prices went up for those. like 5-10k... new toilet, appliances, etc... its better to wait and get a good deal. theres no rush bro

Hopefully they continue to go higher. Not sure why the 10yr stalled out around 1.6%... really should be much higher.

You‚Äôre not familiar with commercial loans then. Like the two that I mentioned are fairly common, Loan to value and debt yield. Loan to value depends upon the value assessed for the property and debt yield accounts for NOI v total debt. In a recession your property value might go down considerably or your NOI due to vacancy because tenants can‚Äôt afford the rent. Break the covenant and the bank will try to seek recourse somehow liquidation etc.

I left out one part. BB actually rallied first in late May and I woke up that morning and said fuck it and threw $10k on margin on $20 calls and watched it like a hawk all day. It ran up from $12 to $20 by the next day and I made a cool $50k. I then basically threw that $50k in mostly CLOV shares and calls and added to my SoFi calls. Then CLOV pumped and SoFi finished its merger and pumped as well. All the good comes at once just as the bad lmao

RKT why can't I quit you?!
That‚Äôs not a bad quote , I‚Äôm surprised cashflow said it
Here‚Äôs my story. Stumbled upon WSB at $45k in Jan and went up majorly on BB AMC NOK for about a week before crashing hard and losing lots of money on options until my May low of $22k. CLOV SOFI ran hard and pushed me from $22k to $330k in June. I didn‚Äôt learn my lesson tho and bought $200k worth of CLOV at $12-16 and $100k of SoFi at $21 avg. Wasted a lot of money on dumb option calls and got margin called until I got down to $93k in august. Had some good luck in august earnings and went back up to $155k then rode CLOV Labor Day to $240k before it crashed the next day. Made more poor moves somehow?? And ended up falling all the way to $45k after our last major SPY pullback. Took a $15k personal loan and now have gone from $60k to $150k riding TSLA SOFI. I think I‚Äôve learned from my mistakes now and next stop will be 1M. To be continued‚Ä¶
Why do I feel like this means you're gonna do it more often
If buying houses at the top of the market and then trying to resell them at an even higher price as the market comes down isn't a winning formula for Zillow, why would it work any better for it's competitors?
Bought 500k worth of physical Platinum and Gold the last week.   Am I an idiot.  Yes‚Ä¶. YES I AM.  However, shit is about to get really uncomfortable for all you so hang tight.

"Powell made 26 trades in all in 2020, seven sales and 19 purchases," wrote the American Prospect, which first reported the disclosures. "But the October 1 trade stands out because of its size and timing."  
Powell, who is believed to be worth as much as $55 million, sold between $1 million and $5 million of Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund shares on Oct. 1, 2020. That same month, the Dow tumbled nearly 1,600 points, about 6%, marking one of the steepest monthly drops since the coronavirus pandemic brought the country's economy to its knees.

Selling credit spreads against debit spread to lock in gains is kinda wack imo (in your scenario anyways), esp for something like AMZN where the bid/ask can be your profit  (since you're looking at .3 profit per spread for only $150 in gains).

If AMZN goes higher than 3515 then you're actually pretty fucked.

In fact if it continues to green tomorrow you're gonna say goodbye to the profit from that tight debit spread.

Dunno, but according to what i have read it was organic buying pressure combined with some minor amount of shorts covering. It was 900,000 accounts buying GME. It was in January.....how many more shares was bought since then? Just show me on what volume after Jen shorts covered if even GG and SEC just told you they did not ...????

I think the ~~theory~~ con is that there is a huge crash coming, and when it does all these shorts will get margined called. Which totally discounts all the institutional investors that would have to dump something so overpriced early in a real crash. It's like how CNBC plays both the crash and the bull market side of the story. It's trying to have an angle on both outcomes.

- The bottom 90% of Americans held about 11% of stocks, and added $1.2 trillion in wealth during the Covid-19 pandemic.

1. Don't tell me these crazy markets aren't being fueled by some shady shit going on between hedge funds. $6.5 trillion. That's a third of the entire US muthafuckin GDP. 
2. Bruh, literally half of that $1.7 trillion probably came from GME/AMC. Crazy to think about.

People like to shit on FUBO, but my LEAPs are up 50% in 3 weeks, $7k. Plus 5-10k from day trading FDs. Looking forward to guidance at earnings this quarter, with the sportsbook active.
There are 5 possibilities:

* Nuclear weapons are never used again
* Nuclear war occurs at a regional scale and before it expands further it scares the rest of the world into halting hostilities and addressing the issue of nuclear weapons
* Nuclear war occurs at a global scale after sufficient preparations have been made for a portion of the human race to survive and repopulate
* Nuclear war occurs at a global scale before sufficient preparations have been made and humans go extinct, but everything humanity leaves behind on Earth leads to the reemergence of intelligent life more capable of survival than humans
* Nuclear war destroys Earth's biosphere forever

Considering these 5 possibilities, Mutually Assured Destruction is dumb as fuck. Even if you're already dying, there's no upside to using nukes - unless you're fuckin psychotic, which the overlords of the world are, which is why there are so many nukes all over the planet.

When using chat support, I would rather just get to the problem and solution instead of having a conversation about how I'm doing and the weather. Especially when every response from them takes 30 seconds or more. Plus the "thank you for providing the details" after every response.  Or they repeat what you say ("I understand that you're having issues with voicemail?") No shit, it's what I just said. The automated systems are even worse, have to enter your number at every turn and then the live person asks you for it again.  I guess I'm an a-hole.

That's a fair consideration. I think they'll have a solid quarter according to their own estimates of $2 billion in revenue. The market cap isn't that bad next to their revenue ($21 billion), they are profitable already if however slight, and I like the reason they dipped today if anything.

If they have more employees and offices than OPEN and are hitting the brakes when growth for its own sake is a selling point for stocks in this sector, it implies a firm and determined prudence to me.

I lived through Septembear and early Octobear, 

I‚Äôm a survivor.
Just report them, it makes them stand out more to us.
Honestly, buying options 1-2 weeks out in combo with some close DTEs can work with a lot of people's mindsets compared to 1-2 month out shit when looking at indices at the very least. Not to say that buying less than 2 days out is really ever smart, but I've trained myself not to FOMO into dumb shit because there always seems to be a heavily profitable move at my disposal.

I mean I'm ADHD as fuck so I will hyperfocus on the "now", and will usually just eat up losses with monthlies even tho they've got some time. On top of that, I usually focus less on a good entry, which at the end of the day, is really the difference in winning and losing with options. With weeklies, as long as I'm focused and not just randomly flipping into shit on whims (gotta add this to your mental checklist for sure), I'm more confident in betting on easy to project, yet small, changes in stocks with a high level of reward for a good effort. No FOMO needed if you can make 50% gains on a 1% change in price, as long as you understand that *close expiries eliminate the need for FOMO due to their payout*

*For example: why play the EV stock lotto searching far and wide for a 30% gain when you can do something like I did this morning and buy weekly AAPL calls on the dip during an obvious period of high liquidity on the market where volatility is dying. 30% in an hour and shit felt easy

You gotta have money already to make money
Have a stop loss in place that you can live with at the current price. (Meaning, you're still psyched about the return.) Move the stop loss up when the stock goes up. If you get stopped out, set a price where you will buy back in and repeat.
What? Inflation still applies to your remaining 94%. This take is extra retarded.

Fwiw if you ever want to replace share holdings, buying LEAPs are better than monthlies like March which is less than 5 months out. You can also look into synthetic long position to save on the capital.

Finally, at these price level it's generally better to go with SPX options as there are significant tax savings (60/40 rule).

You can Google all that I mentioned above for more details.

So I look at Fintel Short Volume for SPY each trading day. It's not exactly representative of short interest, it has something to do with how they clear trades through dark pools.  What's interesting though is that normally on up days this number is high,  above 60%, and on down days it's below 50%. 

Today's number is 45%. This may just be representative of GEX or DIX or something I don't understand,  but it is an anomaly from the last few months of watching this figure on days when SPY is up.

Yikes. I don‚Äôt know if you have ever seen the SPY chart‚Ä¶ Poots are short term plays
Agreed. Mouse always beats the house.
We‚Äôre all new to options at one point or another ‚Ä¶. I was equally as lost when I bought for the first time. Generally speaking, most options that are down +50% never come back to break even or be positive, so I either cut it loose and take the loss at that point, or double down and buy more calls/puts it I‚Äôm still confident in the play
You made the mistake of giving them a tazer?!?

If you pay $180, it drops to $100 and you paper hand like a lil bitch you will have lost $80. Now if you hold strong and ride that bitch all the way down you will lose the whole $180 but you get to meet me at the bottom so it levels out in the end.

Interesting question--I have never heard of companies doing that.

Look at what your RSI suggested for stocks that went vertical in the past. Don't blindly rely on an indicator you don't understand. The overbought/oversold interpretation of the RSI works when you already assume a stock is range bound or trading inside a tunnel.

The best reply.
Internalized orders can't stay Internalized forever. Between those two market makers you're looking at 6.4 billion dollars internalized on the 27th and another 2.2B on the 28th. 

That's a lot of internalized gme shares that need to be bought back on the market. They internalized retails buy orders, they need someone to sell them those shares to get the liability off the books, otherwise it's a naked short position.

GME, until post January, had a market cap of less then 1 billion. There's only one way you get 4.2 billion dollars worth of a sub-billion market cap company in a single day, and those positions are (clearly), very hard to close.

Edit: also, virtu internalized 2.2 billion dollars worth of gme within a single trading day of the above as per the same report.

HOOD 

I‚Äôm not a fan but think there might be a nice surge for the next 7-10 days.  WHY? 

HOOD‚Äôs early lock-up expires next Tuesday after they report earnings.  (Early lock-up‚Äôs expirations in conjunction with reporting earnings has become a thing). 

During early lockup (90 Days post IPO) only founders, senior managers &amp; board members are allowed to sell.  Investors &amp; Syndicate Members have to wait 180 days however many of them asked the SEC to allow them to also sell early as many had to pony up additional money during the GME short squeeze.  Seems the SEC will allow some flexibility (including Bloomberg article with additional info) 

Robinhood Early Investors Granted SEC Approval to Sell Shares 
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/robinhood-early-investors-granted-sec-approval-to-sell-shares

Remember HOOD has a lot of big founding investors and GS also took them public and picked up IPO shares (GreenShoe) don‚Äôt know look it up. 

I‚Äôm almost sure insiders will pump the price for the next week in order for the price to be a lot more attractive vs where it‚Äôs currently sitting.  This way they can sell and lock a higher profit.

Sure, but the sec report says citadel and virtu internalized billions of dollars worth of gme orders on the 26th and 27th - which actually goes a long way to explaining the continued price action i.e. why it's at 180 and not 30 with quarerly spikes into the 200s and 300s. Internalizing orders != covering.

Edit: Direct quote "Citadel internalized 4.2 billion dollars worth of GME on Jan 27."
I think you misspelled Tampa
My theory is that u/zjz is operating from u/AutoModerator account for a while and manually inputting responses in some sort of scripting exercise. The responses are largely directed at question prompts, the responses are deliberately encompassing enough so as it provide the bot with a framework to learn by itself in a completed script, just needs a large dataset. He's holding his child's hand until it can walk and talk convincingly by itself, which is a nice pet project imo.

You sound like you don‚Äôt trade options very often. It‚Äôs almost (almost!) never the most profitable move to exercise early since you‚Äôre completely torching the extrinsic (time) value of that option. You are better off selling the option for a profit and buying the underlying outright, especially with weeks/months before expiration.
Poor is definitely correct now lmao
Yeah holding 446P
Go 50/50, and keep some for the future dips.
that sounds like a rip off bro

Don‚Äôt forget KNX reporting earnings on Wednesday and TRTN on Thursday.  

KNX = trucking company following JBHT who had a killer beat last Friday and rocketed.  TRTN = shipping container leasing company who is signing long term leases at record prices and just converted their debt from secured to unsecured without seeing an interest rate increase.  Think of how bullish that is‚Ä¶

1-$BA, WATCH THIS CLOSELY TO GO BACK ABOVE 225$

2- $PLTR, POTENTIAL TO RUN 10-15% in a single day considering the IMPV of all the bullish call bets bought Friday and today. This has missed the recent rally in the cloud and techs. Shorts will be busted soon! lots of 25$ and 26$ calls, I mean super big bullish bets.

3- $SPCE, beaten down lately heavily and whales been buying 22$ calls in big numbers.
What are you alls opinion on TRV? Seems like a solid company to me, but it did drop today. I‚Äôm guessing because tomorrow is it‚Äôs earnings.

Pro tip for you TSLA bulls, congrats and fuck you. 

Holding through ER with the already super high IV weeklies is dumb AF. I‚Äôve held shit wherein TSLA went up $50-75 AH for calls ending up worthless the next day (after ER).

It already got "crushed" last Friday and it's already at a year low. IV crush usually happens when there's a run up in IV. If the IV stays that low until Wednesday, we might not even see an IV crush after ER.

EDIT: FDs though might get crushed, their IV is a bit high (but still low compared to this year's average).
I think I‚Äôm finally going to start buying the dip
CVS has earnings on Nov 3.

You'll probably lose 20k, but I like this bet. All 3 are way too high. AFRM is the best of the bunch and it's insanely high.

Honestly, market cap is a notional figure at any time.  Multiplying the last trade price by the number of shares out gives a number, which is why it is used; but the fact is, not all those shares would trade at that price if they were suddenly forced to be transacted.  Contrariwise, the fact that not all shares *did* trade at the last price suggests that their true value to most of their holders is higher than the last trade price; then there are stagnant shares whose holders don't check the last price regularly - e.g., shares mandated to be held by index funds - and thus create a market distortion by their inertia/inaction.

As always tesla goes up. It would seem as if $100 billion-trillion dollar companies offer the most reliable gains. Don't need to speculate on small caps when you can use leverage and make easier money this way with less risk. Same for TECL and TQQQ.
Probably not the worst way to spend your money
Possible but doubt it. Very few people buy with cash outright.

# 4. The Precursors' Motivation: Demonic Irony

I'm sure all who read Silentium will recall the appropriately-numbered String 13: The Gravemind/Primordial's malediction. Pay close attention to this particular passage:

&gt;There is only one truth. That which was done will be done again. For we cannot cease from creating, but the end of all our creation will be to look into a reflection and see *ourselves* for the first time.  
&gt;  
&gt;The pain we have brought on ourselves.  
&gt;  
&gt;The pain you caused us.

Now a  brief moment during String 24, and Catalog's encounter with the Gravemind:

&gt;Precursor hatred of Forerunners is central to establishing motive. They say Forerunners rose up, unprovoked, and destroyed them.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;I detect deliberate contradiction.  
&gt;  
&gt;How can this be? Can such sublime mentality be so distorted?  
&gt;  
&gt;And yet... So rich! so infinitely deep in meaning and broad in scope, I am overwhelmed. The Gravemind studies me, loves me so intensely it will eat me, absorb me into its very center.

Then passages from the tail-end of Primordium, and the Didact and Chakas' "interview" with the Primordial:

&gt;"It was long ago decided. Forerunners will never bear the Mantle...  
&gt;  
&gt;The decision is final. Humans will replace you. Humans will be tested next...  
&gt;  
&gt;Humans will rise again in arrogance and defiance. The Flood will return when they are ripe - and bring them unity...  
&gt;  
&gt;Forerunners will fail as you have failed before. Humans will rise. Whether they will also fail has not been decided...  
&gt;  
&gt;We are the Flood. There is no difference. Until all space and time are rolled up and life is crushed in the folds... no end to war, grief, or pain. In a hundred and one thousand centuries... unity again, and wisdom. Until then - sweetness.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is your task to kill this servent, that *another* may be freed."

It all becomes clear. That which was done will be done again. The purpose of the Forerunner Saga is made evident: Not merely set-up and hints for the Reclaimer Saga, but a mirror of it. The Forerunner Saga chronicles the test of the Forerunners; the Reclaimer Saga chronicles the test of humanity. Down to the same beats, the same *characters*.

Ever noticed the parallels in the IsoDidact's backstory? A naive and innocent child of great potential is selected by a brilliant scientist, his life hijacked, his "true" self buried deep inside as he is morphed into an echo of an ancient, legendary warrior, the perfect protector to save his civilization (and, in the end, the galaxy)?

Now look again at:

&gt;That which was done will be done again... the end of all our creation will be to look into a reflection and see *ourselves* for the first time. The pain we have brought on ourselves. The pain you caused us.

Their motivation is to see "themselves, the pain they brought on themselves, the pain Forerunners caused them". That pain: **The betrayal of creators at the hands of their creations...**

At the hands of the ***created***.

How did the Forerunner's "test" commence? The subversion of their most advanced AI, their most trusted servant and creation, to sabotage their defenses and pave the way for Flood's conquest, all in the name of the Mantle.

And humanity's test? I had thought Cortana's betrayal was a product of last-minute revisions to Halo 5's story, but now I'm certain it was always meant to play out this way. Maybe even before 343, all the way back to Halo 3: How many times have we wondered why [the Gravemind didn't just swat aside Chief?](https://youtu.be/cmXEiDqjjj8?t=3360) Why he seemed to do [what he did after Chief retrieved Cortana?](https://youtu.be/cmXEiDqjjj8?t=3917) And maybe even now we have something of an answer to why Johnson wasn't infected -- or earth itself even when an entire Flood-infested ship crashed into it:

&gt;IsoDidact: "C*an the Flood choose to infect, or not to infect?"*  


&gt;The Wide, flat head canted to one side, as if savoring some demonic irony. "No immunity. Judgement. ***Timing.***"


&gt;Ur-Didact: "An astonishing strategic feint, one I cannot help but admire."

There even parallels between the Ancient Human-Forerunner War and the Covenant War. In each, Forerunners/humanity face their greatest enemy, and the greatest warriors of each race (Didact and his Prometheans/Master Chief and his Spartans) rise in response. Each becomes a three-way conflict wherein the Flood plays a vital part in weakening the enemy until the Forerunners/humans triumph, though the Flood itself is "defeated". Following each, Forerunners/umans enjoy an era of newfound supremacy and advancement... while their saviors are ultimately betrayed and cast aside.

Then: The Didact is released from his Cryptum by a human. The Didact is -- seemingly -- disposed of shortly thereafter. A hyper-advanced AI is revealed to be subverted and betrays its masters...

And the very same human finds himself stranded on Zeta Halo, Installation 07, where the opponents of the old war are being used as pawns of the subverted AI and... what?

&gt;Primordial: "It is your task to kill this servant, that *another* may be freed."

But maybe the most "personal" part of this whole plot, the ultimate expression ***we*** will experience of the Precursors reflection of themselves, contradiction, vengeance, and betrayal...


# 5. No Darker Revelation Of Betrayal: Cortana's

First: Did the conflict between Warden Eternal and Cortana strike anybody else as odd? Explained, to an extent, but still a bit off in its purpose? Would it perhaps fit better if, once again, we replaced Warden with Didact, and his vengeful obsession with humanity... and factored in the contradiction and distortion perceived by Catalog in his "interview" with the Gravemind: Intense love and fascination, while at the same time ridden with vengeful hatred?

But do you see how perfectly encapsulated the Precursors' mad desire to cause misery and hideous betrayal would be -- how *demonically ironic* it would have been (or will be) -- for such a partnership to occur between Didact and Cortana? For so long Chief -- *we the players --* have been her choice for the ultimate warrior, the hero who would save first humanity, then the galaxy.

... and then she changes her mind. The "greater good", saving the galaxy, doesn't lie with him or humanity; sorry, Chief! After everything in Halo 4, what does she choose? Machines, and to replace Chief as champion for this mission: Mankind's ultimate nemesis, protector of the ecumene and opponent of earth and all her colonies, Chief's dark counterpart and brother, now himself largely a machine, the Didact.

&gt;Cortana: "Before this is all over, promise me you'll figure out which one of us is the machine."

(I wonder if there was, or will be, some reprise of "You know me..." that was being seeded in this line)

# 6. In Conclusion...

Much of this was written more or less stream-of-conscious, and every time I went over the theories -- even as I was writing them -- new possibilities emerged (I never realized the potential "A.Human-Forerunner War/Covenant War" parallels until I started writing here), and I've almost certainly missed dozens of points that would flesh all this out and might make smaller posts about later.

So apologies for the huge rambling mess I've ended up with here.

I'm now personally convinced the vast majority of these theories reflect the overarching plot of the Reclaimer Saga -- or what *might have been* the overarching plot. I'm anxious that a good part of it has been re-imagined; and while I certainly think much of 343I's content has deserved a decent amount of criticism, it's a terrible possibility to me that the lack of perception in this greater design fueled perhaps greater vitriol than deserved, which led to a lack of confidence and ultimately revision. If much of this is -- or was -- the truth, I haven't given nearly enough credit to whoever weaved this epic tapestry.

**TL;DR: The Forerunner Saga is an almost-direct parallel of the Reclaimer Saga as each species' test for the Mantle. String 13 of Silentium outlines the Precursors' plan: Force their creations to suffer the same horror of betrayal by their creations and loved ones as the Precursors felt. Cortana's betrayal was always meant to reflect Mendicant Bias'; and she was originally meant to personally betray Chief by siding with a composed Didact, his Forerunner counterpart, to "save the galaxy" with him instead. We can surmise with almost complete certainty that on Installation 07, our ultimate enemy will be revealed as a Precursor entity who wants to take advantage of Cortana's betrayal to unleash the Flood on a helpless galaxy.**

SE calls LUV puts
3% is an aweful lot.  Eventually your going to miss a powerful upward move in your position doing this and lose out on normal growth.  You can generate a little extra cash, but selling a covered call is a bearish position.  I want stocks that go up and I want that upward growth all to myself.  I'll do a cash secured put for a stock I want in case it goes down though.  But the key to that is I actually want the stock.  The cash is just a nice bonus.

Just got approved for unlimited OT. They want to see an ape? I will deposit every single paycheck you fucking suites
Have the shorts covered yet?
That's when you sell bullish put credit spreads instead of buying calls.
Can you consistently make 3% of your portfolio per month selling covered calls?

1000000%, new ATHs by November. Some smaller pullback maybe between now and then but I'm not pursuing them.
all EV shit been running lately... I think it might be a repeat of that crazy run a year ago. I have some LCID calls to put my skin in game.
They will slowly start to take on the Big 3 in cloud. With the enterprise clients they already have and better pricing they could have a decent slice of the pie in 5 years

Remember bears, don‚Äôt jump in front of moving trains.
a good stock in what way? short-term huge win? Seems unlikely. 30% in 5 months, ok no big deal if you actually think it's a "good stock". It's not a wsb play then, DCA and hold for decades.

IONQ will keep pumping like a motherfucker and end up like TSLA cult stonk. Retards will tell you it's 'overvalued' because they generate no revenue (like TSLA did) and quantum computers are decades away (just like EVs were 'decades away' back in 2019.

Curious why there's such abysmal volume on CVNA, especially in the lead up to ER.

Surely there's going to be a significant move.  Either they're going to blow the earnings out of the water, due to the crazy used car market, or it's going to dump hard because they can't keep earnings up even in this crazy used car market.
SE ATH tomorrow. LUV sub 49 plz

I believe TOS adjusts the price after hours based on the Greeks. In other words they are projecting the price movement after hours based on how SPY trades AH even though there‚Äôs not a current market for the options to be traded.

thought about scooping up some tesla calls but I  didn‚Äôt want to risk it. hasn‚Äôt had a red day in a while and I don‚Äôt want to take the brunt of it if it opens red
Bought some NET puts today. This thing is way too high
Bought 1000 $BKKT. Please make it moon
Is that what you‚Äôre going with?
How would you put in soft words "fucking retarded action"?
Buy sell sell sell buy buy buy sell buy sell buy sell sell sell!

Chipotle is decent, anyway why? Is the restaurant getting lineups?
Went full autism last week and need to recoupe 11.9K. Should be a major bull week.
Imagine waiting and anticipating a last drop before you make your move on calls, seeing it come in to fruition then doing nothing about it‚Ä¶.. for 4 straight trading days‚Ä¶

Imagine then buying calls and having a much higher chance of it not printing since your cost basis is shit now.

I SAID IMAGINE IT FKRS
PROG!!
But it didn't....
Tesla shares
Prices are still moving in ToS.

Would spontaneously cum with my 10/22 450c‚Äôs that I bought at open today. Ended the day up 120% on those bad boys.
Nah you got this. Another month left to gain so much more.
Did you try setting your account to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in men‚Äù?
Today's trades were holding UPST bought friday, swing trading two UPST from opening to close for 2k profit, AMZN at 11am to 3pm, opened MRNA that turned big red but I'm holding this week, FUBO at 10am to close, and some NVDA swing trades.
Yes for 15 mins
Tesla would dump
Well 70 at $9 and 65 at $8, couldn't even get at least a $0.50 sell off
15 min I think.
Same with mine , pretty much 70% loss and I‚Äôm literally going to hold till expiry if spy keeps going up. Praying for a dump of course
[deleted]
Nah
I see you too are a gambling man üòÖ
Up $600 on them and the earliest ones to expire do so in Dec. üëç
Over/under on how many times the word ‚Äúidiosyncratic‚Äù appears in the SEC‚Äôs GameStop report?
I've been buying long dated and selling once up a good bit and then rolling it on the next red day.

When are earnings?
Portfolio at ATH at this point wondering to be wuss and cash out or get greedy‚Ä¶
It's been a helluva swing over the last week or so. 

Hope there is still more gas in the tank
I think you'll make some money back tomorrow
Me but with TSLA calls.
Go buy a boat
Yep but they'll continue to say we're "reopening" until the economy is in a pre pandemic state. Which may never happen
We can trade SPY options after close?
Yo chpt boughta go stupid rn watch out boys
For real, where they been?
Hopefully UPST dose better tomorrow
I dont blame you, entire market was green, i expected a trickled rise too, nada.
Permaban this fucking clown
Why, because they delayed next year's movies, or because it's trading choppy in a channel?
Not a good day for me. Started out so promising. But as I look at my port....I really like it. But I dont play zero day options like so many do. So....I'll cash shortly....
I've been selling before close and buying the dip in the morning,  its worked 4/5 times 1 time I missed out on an extra bit of gain.
Sorry buddy. We had a long time of red. The market isn‚Äôt ready to sell again yet it needs a breather. I don‚Äôt expect heavy selling until next week at earliest. Maybe some minor pullbacks

If SPY opens at $449.99 or higher I will donate $10 to a charity of your choice. Then I will stock up on $455 10/22s.
gambled on spy puts on friday and lost 50% today so naturally i'm holding til tomorrow so i can see -75%. You?

Just pre-ordered the new airpods. Love it when Tim Apple takes my money
Getting fucked harder by Bumble‚Äôs stock than by anyone on the app.
Poor bears thought we would dump because it‚Äôs the 18th and that‚Äôs the scheduled dumping day. Lol
I'm with ya
CNBC keeps talking about the reopening as if it‚Äôs happening right now. Everything has been re-open for a fucking year.
\-15k at 10am to +3k at close. Trying not to get afraid of overnight red if my thesis is that the stock is going to rise over the option period. 

I can lose the game of chicken by holding or selling, but minimizing emotion, especially with bigger numbers is so important. Didn't overtrade at all today too, pretty happy about that.
&gt;dumped a ton into DIS calls

I press F

How the fuck was I up 40% on last week and down 20% on Monday alone
for the love of god, please.
Well, if one things for sure, SPY definitely reflects future outlook.
  
Definitely.
  
No doubt.
Ight picked  up 50 HAL calls for tomorrow. Let it go up

Bought 135 446p when it dropped to $8 a piece, there goes another $1k
I bought Disney calls this morning,  175$ 10/22 for .75 each . If I would‚Äôve waited a little longer I could‚Äôve gotten them for .50
Made $3600 today. 3k from FB and the rest from DIS. Sold FB to secure profit and dumped a ton into DIS calls at $170.

No ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553) for tonight
Well they ain't calling it the red new deal
You‚Äôre not their target audience. I spent $2600 on my mbp like 6 years ago
Scary chart tho
Remember folks: I can remain retarded longer than you can remain solvent. RIOT calls at dawn
Tomorrow buy more BBü§™üöÄüíØ
ü§°
Well, I've put in enough work today. Time to smoke a bunch of weed and continue watching AH trades for confirmation bias.
TSLA $1000 before earnings
SOFI making a run.
I‚Äôm hoping for a 2% drop tomorrow. That‚Äôs all.
Spy opens $450 sell my 10/20 450C wait for morning dip, buy more 456/457C 10/22
[deleted]
My move is pray to fuck we pump at open so I can sell me calls
Buying leaps and not paperhanding is the key to this game
Not selling until MSFT is at least 310. Fuck you, bots, *you owe me* for pulling this horseshit the past month. 2%, now.
I‚Äôd wait for 26,000%

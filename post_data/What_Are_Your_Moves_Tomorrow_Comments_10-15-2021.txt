Nah I'd give you some money back for a while till I had 6 people giving me money and then I'd roll it all over and promise to 10x it till I had enough to retire.

Then I'd forget you exist
Not when you start printing trillions
Totally depends on who you ask. A large portion of the population is living paycheck to paycheck and could never even imagine having more than even $10,000 in their account. Even the middle class may have trouble saving over 20k on a middle class salary.

Credit goes to u/TheYoungPaulBlart for a gift from OG WSB I found in my saved posts. It seems relevant in these dire times:

Stocks only go up


*This economic data looks grim,* I think to myself. *This is the right move.* I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.

I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&amp;P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.

I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. "What am I-" 

"Why did you short the domestic market?" he asks.

"Huh?" I respond, confused.

"Why did you short the domestic market?" he demands, louder this time.

"I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.

"It's priced in," he says coolly. "So why did you short the domestic market?"

Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&amp;P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. "Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.

"Repeat after me: stocks only go up," Powell demands.

I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&amp;P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.

Powell frowns and continues, "I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?"

I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, "GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.

"Stocks only go up," Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&amp;P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.

The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.

"Stocks only go up," I say.
well, I'm not saying they should be valued higher I'm saying the market is irrational. just look at LCID valued at $38b for no reason at all.

Fundamental problem they cannot do flights with low turnaround and now have to redesign it or find a stop gap solution shouldn‚Äôt have with Burt Rutan design.

I think the problem is that even the most advanced depiction of AI depicts it with at least a semblance of human values. We assume that it could be malevolent to humans, or that disinterest could bring aggression. The reality is that preferring existence over non-existence is only a preference in humans because of a biological need to procreate, a biological need any machine will lack. Preferring non-existence, or becoming sentient with no motivating factors, are both valid arguments.

I think any real danger exists in the creation of sort of proto-AI, the old story about the envelope mailing bot that destroys humanity so it can more efficiently mail envelopes. Not a true AI

&gt; Sofi Yolo is a meme that originated on Twitter. It involves posting an image of Sofia Vergara with the caption ‚ÄúSofi Yolo‚Äù, which is short for ‚Äúsofia you only live once‚Äù. The phrase was popularized by rapper Drake in his song "KMT" and has since been used as a hashtag on social media to express excitement or enthusiasm about something.
Thats true. Arent we already fucked? See the bot ü§ñ

China financial regulators told some major banks late last month to accelerate approval of mortgages in the last quarter, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter.

The truth is if you want to triple your money in two years trading spreads, you can‚Äôt have a hedged portfolio. If you buy and hold shares in the right company you can do it while relatively cheaply hedging with puts but the thing is you have to pick the right company. I was mostly selling SPX put spreads and I would have had this same return even if SPX stayed flat the entire time. One issue with spreads is that truly hedging them against max loss would cost more than the premium you get from selling them. The way I mitigated risk was looking at RSI indicators, choosing strikes that were very far OTM, and only doing it for stocks I actually believed in as opposed to meme stocks which give a ton of premium from selling options but you never know if the stock is just gonna go to 0. The few times my spreads looked like they were gonna get breached, I could roll them to a later date like 2 months out for a tiny credit but I felt very safe that things like SPX would always bounce back from any correction. I aimed for like 20% per month last year when vix was higher but now it‚Äôs like 8-10%. Compound interest is crazy

Okay, Visual Mod. What stocks are you buying?
Modern man has transformed himself into a commodity; he experiences his life energy as an investment with which he should make the highest profit, considering his position and the situation on the personality market. He is alienated from himself, from his fellow men and from nature. His main aim is the profitable exchange of his skills, knowledge, and of himself, his "personality package" with others who are equally intent on a fair and profitable exchange. Life has no goal except the one to move, no principle except the one of fair exchange, no satisfaction except the one to consume.

I mean relative to other forms of media in the US, I think he does. If push comes to shove and there‚Äôs enough pressure to vet all news sources/tighten what can and cannot be said, I‚Äôm not certain he‚Äôll be able to hold out. I think it‚Äôd be easier to comply and simply only approve official sources, but he‚Äôs still managing to hold out
visualmod what‚Äôs your favorite Nicholas Cage movie?
Visualmod are you a virgin? You want me to change that behind the Wendy's?

I was going to make a snarky joke, but I'll skip it and say something else. It's really interesting how the two big institutions that hate Facebook are politicians and the media. Their lives and livelihoods are based on popularity, and Facebook is the platform where that power and popularity is found. Facebook doesn't make people sadder, stupider, or more racist (or maybe it contributes 1% to that stuff). Instead, it just moves stuff that has people have already dealt with for thousands of years in their local communities up to the internet. Meanwhile, the groups that don't care are Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Their standards of power are money, not popularity. So Facebook is not the focus of their hatred. It's just a place to invest or get a job.
Visualmod did you know that I think you're funny?
I know right. My cereal is now stale as hell

Yeahh i saw that but to be fair I don‚Äôt think this guy was at all referencing the same conspiracy theories. 

He claimed he was a half reptilian hybrid, and that reptilians are actually the *good guys*. This is contradictory to most alien/UFO lore that generally portrays the reptilians as bad guys. 

There‚Äôs like, a whole bullshit UFO/Alien lore storyline that‚Äôs been crafted since the 50s. 

It‚Äôs inconsistent, because it‚Äôs composed from a bunch of separate UFO/Alien encounter stories crafted by a wide and diverse array of what you could call a bunch of attention seeking antisocial nerds who are almost *certainly* lying about absolutely everything, but there‚Äôs a general overarching ‚Äúplot‚Äù. 

Nordics are good guys, greys go back and forth but are typically in a servant position to another alien race, Reptilians are almost *always* bad guys, although sometimes they‚Äôre more ‚Äúneutral‚Äù.
For real just saw him. Was like damn son, you got huge again. He was doing good for a while.

Fuck‚Ä¶ atleast I didn‚Äôt buy 0DTE spy 440 puts and VIX calls‚Ä¶
What are you selling next week?
Those aren‚Äôt blackberries, it‚Äôs bull sh‚Ä¶scat
So was today a bull trap? Was grinding downward and about to rotate into small cap, cash gang or go üåà whatever, then this. Downvotes say no, flawless DD.
The days of TSLA meme stock man√≠a long gone right? 

Spy produces more 10 baggers three times a week than TSLA does in a month. 

Those options are absurdly expensive and you need massive moves to really get the payout. Seems dumb playing it except on Friday‚Äôs calls or puts.
Inflation is electric on/off switchery.
People are finally waking up
ZJZ will suck you off for a thousand bucks. Visual mod can't watch.
Plague üêÄs suddenly don't like their logic when it comes to something as harmless as sex?
I guess I was wrong about flat day tomorrow. Bears r even more fuk now
Great
Laughed so hard I almost work up my sleeping infant.
Visualmod requires a tribute before answering
Hoes is plural, ho's is possessive. If you're asking if "ho" is spelled with an "e" (hoe; making it hoes plural still and hoe's possessive) that's kind of up to you as it's slang which means technically there is no correct answer. Since it's a shortening of whore you could spell it "whoe or who" if you wanted. In the case of spelling it "ho" your question is answered contextually meaning if you're referring to a group of prostitutes it would be "hoes" as in "Now all you hoes get ready for some deep dickin'." If speaking of a single prostitute's possession or physical trait it's "ho's" as in "That ho's got a dick and I kinda like it." Hope this helps, proper grammar is important.

Oh yeah üòÇ I forgot about that. RIP
VisualMod what do you know about tendies
upvote this to 10 and i'll post something funny
The market is pricing in PERFECTION for TSLA and you are hoping for complete DISASTER by the companies making 10 million cars a year for generations. 

They need like 30 gigs factories to produce the cars to generate the 40billion in revenue wall st expects them to generate in 2030.  And hopefully no rate hikes happen before then that dramatically cut those numbers down. 

Nobody hates the company. It‚Äôs just that under the surface the stock price, not the company, could implode.
The moment I buy SPY calls, the market will reverse. Staying out. You‚Äôre welcome bulls
If you have to ask we all know
I didn‚Äôt see this till now but you made my night
Well bears if your wife wasn‚Äôt a stripper before she is now

We all get caught with our pants down. I sold 2 $115 calls on SPXL that expire on November 19th a few days ago when it was looking bleak. Definitely losing those shares, but I went today and sold a couple $112 puts for the same expiration just to lesson the pain.

Watch Elon again in Annual Meeting. He says this is the case.

Tesla which sells out of cars is now selling 1/2 as many cars as GM and Ford and is now able to produce over 1 million cars per year at this time.

In addition to still selling out of vehicles they are about to have a surge in supply because of two new factories opening and their margin is actually increasing. 

It‚Äôs ok if you think the company is overvalued but if you think the market will suddenly change it‚Äôs mind on Tesla‚Äôs value with all of that happening in the next 6 months you are a dalt. 

Do not short Tesla right now. The momentum will kill you. You have been warned. This is not a good play. Lots of stuff buy cheap right and lots to sell short‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs not TSLA.

Market doesn't care about whatever the media tries to make us worried about. When the big players decide it's time to crash the markets, that's when it will crash.

Strong and weak have nothing to do with evolution, it‚Äôs that the best adapted survive and those that aren‚Äôt die. Neanderthals were stronger than us and had larger brains, the reason we survived was not because we were stronger but because we were more coordinated  and social, and because we have the best throwing arm in the animal kingdom by far, allowing us range. They also lacked the ambition to seek out new lands to inhabit, they tended to stay in one area, so when that area became barren, they died off. We are one of, if not the most adaptable species on the planet. Don‚Äôt try to use evolution as an argument when you‚Äôre too ignorant to even understand the basics of survival of the fittest.

As someone who's worked for someone else and started my own business, having your own business is not necessarily more profitable. It's definitely much riskier.
Ok it was stupid to buy teligent. It‚Äôs getting delisted‚Ä¶ my plan is to sell and cut my loses. I‚Äôm a retard. Unless somehow holding these shares through the delisting is good?

Sorry for swearing I was excited because jack ma is in HK.
Want to know how the human race will actually end? It‚Äôs because we are literally spitting into natures face‚Ä¶. But before we get to that, let‚Äôs start from the beginning, shall we? 

Humans (homo sapien) had been on the verge of extinction a few times in the way way past, which then required quite a bit of inbreeding to get out of and thus ruining our genetic diversity. Yes, hybridization with Neanderthals helped a bit but not much. And even Africans who have the highest genetic diversity among humans were still much less then most species of animals‚Ä¶ So right from the get go humans are working with a stacked deck against them‚Ä¶.

Now, let‚Äôs move to modern times and to the point of why we are spitting in nature‚Äôs face‚Ä¶.. As nature dictates, the weak die and the strong live. Yet we have broken that rule. For example. Back 10,000 years ago, if you were born without a leg or with schizophrenia, you would never make it to reproduction age, instead you would have been killed by wolves or banished from the troup. But in the day and age we have prosthetics and medication to treat people with and thus allowing these bad genes to be passed down to new generations!

On top of all that, we have had many wars and each time we send the healthiest and strongest males (aka our best breeding stock) to go fight and thus die in them‚Ä¶ So essentially we are killing off the strong and letting the weak live!!! 

Now sure some of you are going to say ‚Äúbut soon we will be able to genetically engineer babies‚Äù But in reality that will only be for the super rich and a select few‚Ä¶.. In just a few generations humans will be basically be brain dead üíÄ

**Reason why $SPY will always go up**

Main requirement to join the S&amp;P 500:

&gt;last reported quarter must be profitable ‚úÖ

&gt;aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ‚úÖ

Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in todays economy.

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 10-20 unprofitable loser companies get delisted from S&amp;P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy constantly and always follows profits.

The production line enabled economies of scale and great increases in production. However, the demand for buying expensive cars and consumer goods were struggling to keep up. Therefore, towards the end of the 1920s, many firms were struggling to sell all their production. This caused some of the disappointing profit results which precipitated falls in share prices.

IPO was $24 and it wasn't some random SPAC meaning wall street and venture capital guys behind it thought it was a fair price. AMZN also offered to buy them out at 10 Billion in 2015 when tech companies have nowhere near valuations they have now which is a valuation of $16 back then. Yes they had a bad quarter but will rebound. $WISH will hit $9+ sometime before 2021 ends.

I had to stalk your profile to find it. Reasonable. The more gas SPY has, the harder it will reject if/when it finally goes. I think you got fucked by momentum this week with the inverse h&amp;s and there's still more steam to break away from the September retracement. I think we'll at least touch a new ATH before then, though I'm unsure of the timing. 


Market seems to be ignoring the warning signs for now, which is a possible signal that things are getting too euphoric. Big names buying up lots of gold or üåΩ, or some other commodities. Kind of spooky.

If the ref determines the defender is unimpeded to the QB he blows the whistle to protect them, since, it‚Äôs a flag. They‚Äôre only going to give you the free play if it benefits you, not a free play to have your QB annihilated by an offsides Vea.

RIOT has a good buy in right now and has seen really nice highs. And, if the analysts are right about the predicted price of 100k, the stock should follow and see really nice gains.

Keep hustling. You‚Äôre personally my Reddit hero. What‚Äôs your opinion on SPY remaining bearish? I have a $442 10/18 put that I think is gonna be fucked on Friday. I always timed the PUTS terribly ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)

Problem with days like today is there isn‚Äôt any obvious play at EOD. No dip to buy and no one sane wants to buy stuff that rocketed up on a random Thursday for no apparent reason.

How many times do I  have to say to buy assets in an inflationary environment until you take 18 seconds to contemplate it?
It sounds counterintuitive, but it's actually the best trading strategy over the past 10-12 years.

The stocks in my long-term portfolio that have performed the best over the past 5 years are stocks that I bought that were already up 50-60% over the previous year when I bought them.

Those are the ones that doubled/tripled again.

There are a lot of &lt;$10bn market cap companies out there that have been super hot the past 2 years and look like they could double/triple again.

Whether you're talking battery stocks or synthetic bio like AMRS, or semiconductor like AMBA.

Okay ty lmk how it goes
QCOM has been oversold over the last few months. It‚Äôs current YoY stock growth is 0%, which i feel is unjustified!
With them diversifying aggressively into Autonomous driving(after their 4.5B acquisition of veoneer), PC (acquisition of nuvia founded by ex - apple  macbook M1 chip lead) and IoT, it‚Äôs not just an smartphone company anymore. I believe they have the most growth potential than any other major tech company at the moment. I see it blasting past 200 once we are completely out of the chip shortage crisis!
I think the real answer is that if it‚Äôs as bad as expected than no reaction if it‚Äôs much worse than there might be some small reaction. But for the life of me I don‚Äôt know anyone in chyneese real estate other than chyna.

Who's joking
As a former HVAC guy, I assure you my number is accurate. In recent years we've installed an ever increasing number of hybrid systems, which run off a heat pump down to 30¬∞, then switch over automagically to oil or gas furnace below that. For anyone on oil heat, the system pays for itself in three years or less. For gas, closer to six years.

I'm not your stepdad, I'm just the guy who fucks your mom.

Slap them around a little. Maybe they‚Äôre napping
Yes though make sure to finance the purchase with 10 interest free payments
No, dump it into TMC
Nice have fun bro!

Nah Imma sell my house for 100 million dollars and buy a really nice Cabela's  Ultimate Alaknak 12'x12' Outfitter Tent with a woodstove and generator to charge my 50" flat screen
They were right are so are you.
I just had to roll over my roth 401k into a roth ira. Should I dump the cash into SPXL?

What you just said sounds very logical, therefore we‚Äôre probably gonna get another face ripper and should both yolo every penny into spy calls at open.  üôÑ

Someone asked me why I was late to work and I said it was the global supply chain crisis - not sure why but people were confused

u/cashflow_ futures are green again
.
Why
you can do it in swimming pools.
Earnings reported‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm bummed. Supply chain shortages dropped the FY projections
Because I think you will see sexual is better.
Go fuck yourself bear. I‚Äôm all in at $8.93 average. I know this will either double or lose half its value next week. Im willing to risk it all coward ass. I hope u lose everything.
Scuba is fucking badass. Haven‚Äôt done it in awhile but it‚Äôs a great experience

Hopefully buy a dip if we red Friday. If not, my port will be up over 10% this week üòé
Poor VIX :(
Yes
For now. Build the position with your swings. Insider selling will slow down in a few months, until then I'm down to sell otm CCs and slowly build up. But you know this and will be there. Gl

No.
Grab some XL it‚Äôs the best
Lol
Why?
Doubt. I agree, those suppliers jacked up, but i bet there‚Äôs also things jacking up downstream of them. Everyone in the chain adding %.
Cramer keep SoFi out of your mouth. Stop ruining a good thing.
you looked at NET lately?
Futes started to suck cock really quickly.

Thanks man
Puts on fedex for delivering a package to my house when I requested hold at facility with signature.

They dropped it on porch with a signature release.
All good. I‚Äôll get it back
Covered calls are the cherry on top for me. Like Im going to ride the wave up, sell some weeklies, and cash out. SDC was very lucrative for CC's and turning a little profit. Nothing huge but it was fun.
Why did CRSR take a fat dump at the end of the day?
Well, I think you should be sexual.
Pokemon Go is actually fun. There I said it, fight me.
Sold my calls because someone called me retarded. Bought them back because I hate myself.

The truest measure of inflation is when they change the price on the box of little debbie snacks. That's why JPOW likes to exclude foodstuffs, he doesnt want you to know the truth. Wait til you see them little christmas tree cakes at $12.99 for a small box.

Remember, bears: you deserve this, and so much worse, for having the sheer *arrogance* to think you could buy puts- to actually bet that stocks would *go down,* harming people's retirement funds and general financial well-being -and get away with it.

Fuck. You.

People think they know shit. ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt i successful! I deserve the money! John doesnt work harder than me!‚Äù 

Wrong.

Really successful people put in the fucking grind. They know 100x what another person knows. They ground for years. 2+ more hours learning per day than their coworkers and for years, there was no obvious difference. Then ‚Äúovernight success.‚Äù The knowledge gap is huge.
BABA should open at $170 tomorrow.

if you think youll find any more than a couple hours of fun or use from something that is cheaper than your usual yolo, just buy it.

I‚Äôm sorry buddy. No one knows what the market is going to do. I really do think we are downtrending still and their are a ton of indicators to back me up.
  
That green candle was very concerning to me. Wish I sold all my puts then also. Live and learn. Good luck
China is not investable. You are going to see FDI outflows from China as investors pull money. Not being able to IPO in NY is a big deal as China has a closed capital account.

The sad thing about all you ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù and P&amp;D chasers is you only know how to make money as it goes up and you end up being bagholders. Learn about puts and shorting. Buy and hold is for long term (years) investing and bagholders.

I actually have this problem with talking about acid and mushrooms
People who bought into CRSR because its a cheap stock, well great news its going to get even cheaper. Might even see a P/S ratio of 1. 

Turns out cheap doesn't mean you'll make a return on your investment. Sucks. Maybe in 2 years though. Hard to fight market sentiment.

This is in regards to NIO but I guess Chinese ‚Äústocks‚Äù in general, so here goes:

I‚Äôve been doing some more reading and I‚Äôm torn with one specific number in mind. Last year China received the most direct foreign investment in the world with 164B about. This number makes me both worry more and worry less about VIE structure and my reasoning is as follows: 

1. This 160B is a huge number and it was somewhat historic for a China to dethrone the US. Since direct foreign investment is somewhere between illegal and just not supported, it is safe to assume that a majority of this money was through the VIE structure. Since that‚Äôs the case, China LITERALLY has the ability to keep most of that money and just terminate as many VIE‚Äôs as possible. Sure there will be some they can‚Äôt terminate due to contractual obligations, but 99.999% of them would be extinct due to the clause specifying this situation in almost VIE prospectus. 

But on the other hand 

2. China JUST set this historic mark. It now had a moment where it received the most cash flow from foreigners investing in their shit. Why would they want that to stop? This is only fueling their already amazing growth rate, AND gives them pride in their culture/products. Both of these things are of huge importance to the CCP. Growth increases their power, and cultural pride increases their sociopolitical standing. 
Cutting off VIE contracts would severely damage both of these aspects. 

Any thoughts? Seems to be split down the middle for me lol.

what's a good 0dte play tomorrow? looking for extra xmas money to spend
Yes
It‚Äôs funny when people buy calls after SPY goes up ~3% in a week but not when SPY was red for a whole consecutive week
maybe exiting SOFI if it stays positive and hits above 21+

maybe exiting CLOV too if it goes $2 higher

buying intel with whatever i recoup - i hear their chips are gonna be 40% faster and that could bring them to ATH which isnt a big move for them, their stock is less volatile.
So more high tech than what they currently have.
I say it's gonna expire worthless you stupid whore and then stick it in the ass.
It doesn‚Äôt predict anything. It‚Äôs the price in the future, now. Completely unrelated to tomorrow‚Äôs price of SPY.

Completely reasonable thing to wonder given all of the failed promises and the self-driving technology that is marginally better than decades old tech

SPY will never stop fucking me over
FB? I‚Äôve been playing it this week and it can be frustrating short term,it‚Äôs been underperforming the market even after testing 200 DMA I‚Äôd say LEAPS if I get back in that
In my experience based opinion they are mostly just dumb. That‚Äôs why they work as bootlickers
It does seem like eod spy puts could be the play but this bitch probably gonna rip tomorrow again üò∂
Probably not. Richard Branson is starting to feel like Chamath to me. Scammy mofos.

How does someone here not have a twitch stream or YouTube stream of just trading all day. Just dumb bets that chat gets in with and you all get Tendies with your viewers. Then when your viewers copy your play they donate there tendies to you. Even though it looks like you‚Äôre losing you‚Äôre still wining
Their growth is dictated by the growth of the fabless companies who are filling orders. They'll grow by completing construction on more mega-foundries, like the one they're building in Arizona. That allows them to fill orders more quickly and move more units with more efficiency (because better tech at the newer foundry). They're the ones that can pass on increased cost and maintain their margins, even when supply is thin. The fabless companies don't have that luxury.
For my next trick: CPNG
Hint: they can get delayed again
I have three contracts of $325 calls (14.90 premium) $MRNA for 10/29

They‚Äôll continue to be successful as far as just being a business. As far as investors are concerned though, will they *grow* profits in a huge way? How would they do that when they already have a near monopoly? 

I‚Äôm not an expert by any means, but I was asking around about TSM a lot earlier this year and this was the consensus I got about the company.

Well, I believe the issue with TSM is that they‚Äôre so absurdly dominant, people are worried they can only lose market share from here. 

Now, I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs correct. They do have the best tech hands down. The western world is seemingly very concerned about over reliance on Taiwan though.

That‚Äôs the entire point to buying physical. Just like Gold.  Research Chinas change to Fuel cells.  Which have double the demand / use of platinum.  If the US also goes deeper towards fuel cells vs electric fir diesel replacement which makes more sense due to lack of infastructure in near term, platinum demand could jump drastically in the next decade.  Easily see it going back up 100% to all time highs.  Especially the short squeeze needing to happen since the volkswagon debacle.

What's crazy to me is that TSM, their foundry (and most companies' foundry) is doing pretty shit comparatively. Like, if TSM goes down because China or whatever, NVIDIA, QCOM, TI, AMD, and many others are pretty fucked in terms of sourcing. They gonna buy from Samsung? Intel can't even support their own operations because they buy from TSM as well.

We don't read charts here.
Idk why but my masters in theoretical basket weaving does not seem to be leading to gains
Fear of what? Everyone knew that the Fed would taper in November last month. Everyone knew that CPI would come in high which is why they revised the estimates up to conveniently match it. Today just felt like a bear slaughter and a bull trap combined into one. Tomorrow is OPEX, so we shall see what happens when the MMs hedge comes off for a bit. Back to ATH next week though just to trap everyone until the November FOMC fear cycle gets underway.

He buys puts and he then goes on to rage with whoever he finds on the thread.. He thinks buying puts is a strategy he discovered.
One green day in one and a half months of red doesn't equal an uptrend. SPY is still flat/downtrending until it breaks 450 again. Next week will be a test to see if it holds 445.

Eating ass is one of the most natural things to do in life. You are literally placing your mouth in front of an excrement orifice that gives out residue of whatever your homie ate. By ingesting it yourself after it comes out of his ass, you are ensuring proper cycling of food and minimizing waste making sure that all nutrients that were not absorbed by your homie gets a chance inside your own body.
Actually that was the biggest lesson lol. When I started selling them I became consistently profitable
That's what you get for betting against America.

Yep seeing the exact same thing in a lot of these names.  The favored one is getting like 4x the P/S ratio.  It's insane.

There is no reason for NET to be worth 10x FSLY.  At most a 3x makes sense.

Oh well, same dumpster fire.

Work 15 hour days and sleep in my car most of the time as the round trip commute was 6-8 hours a day due to traffic.  Get a gym membership so I had a place to shower.  Get tasked with doing a job that had me fly all over the country to a new place every week for 2 years.  Fly out Sunday Night and Fly back Saturday morning.  Constantly take on any new technology and learn everything about existing tech being used by our company and ones we worked with.  Enough to be able to use, speak on and manage, but not a full expert.  Sacrifice personal time and SO to get where I am today.  I have done it for so long, that it has just become easy.  

I no longer sleep in my car and such and my marriage is fine.  No college.  Just willing to do what others wouldn‚Äôt.  No kids either.  See something new coming watch every damn you tube video about it and how to videos and articles.

I keep getting people saying "what stocks would you buy that aren't already up a ton", and my answer is that the stocks that have run the most will run more if they have the growth runway to justify it.

The stocks that are up 100% the past year are a lot more likely to go up another 50% than the stocks that are being ignored by investors.

Obviously that doesn't mean you should Yolo on UPST but there's others that are up 200% but look like they could have a lot more runway based on market cap.

One of those is AMBA.

Too much happy and bullish talk in here. Puts at open.
I hate seeing retards buying shares, what are you 90?

Buying shares is for lame ass pussies. 

If that stock you‚Äôre looking at isn‚Äôt some micro cap trash, you should be buying calls on it (or puts if you‚Äôre bearish)

Even if you want to own shares, don‚Äôt buy them. Sell ATM puts and get them assigned decently cheaper than just buying them outright.

I also bought in heavily at ipo, so my cost basis is just now getting to 25.

"Betty White is the only woman to continuously reject my cash offers for sexual favors. I promise her life changing amounts and she belittles and demeans me for it every time without hesitating. It drives me crazy. I think about it so much lately I can't even focus on the market. I have a shrine for Betty White in my house. A Betty White shrine. It only took up one room at first but it needs more and more space for everything I've collected related to Betty White. I don't know if you know this but my house isn't as big as one might think, I'm running out of space. But when I'm there, when I can just melt into my Betty White comforter and stare at my Betty White cardboard cutouts and all her beautiful smiles looking back at me, nothing else matters. I don't care if it ends up to where my whole house looks like that from the moment you walk in. It's like a metaphor for how I'm running out of space in my own head, every brain cell just filling up with Betty White's essence. She's the only thing that's ever made me truly happy, David. I love Betty White. I need her."

I don't know if you guys have heard of these things called shares, but they're like call options and they're usually  more expensive, but they're safer, and you get to keep them forever and you actually get to like own a part of the company or something LOL idk never mind.
Nah the original ones were good. Shit started going south in the 90s I think definitely by the 2000s

#Pro tip


Buy 100 shares of a stock on margin, sell deep ITM leaps, use premium to buy more shares in another stock on margin, sell more ITM leaps, do this infinitely and buy back said options as they go down on the week then keep the leftover premium. Free money glitch.

Bruh people became millionaires off a $1000 put position in march
Is it normal for a super set day at the gym  to only take like 25-30 minutes. I‚Äôm just doing a different workout in between sets
You fucked up the format. Fuckin nerd.
Covid ?
Some guys have all the luck.
442.5p here. My butt hurts.
Nope
Both! More so a swing/long play, but it tends to move fast on breakouts so it‚Äôs definitely one to trade as well
Go ahead, buy that dip....
that is true, im more saying in things like, people ive heard go and see like the price of a ny or ribeye and are like "wow thats all from inflation" like yes it is, but the biggest reason too is cause they jack it up by themselves. IE choice ribeye reg price, was about 11.99lb, and during seasons/holidays theyll change it to 18.99lb and this was in 2019-2020 pre pandemic, and this is the producers like EXCEL, CARGIL, HARRIS, 5 STAR, they send the updates and we'd have to reprice everything. so it wasnt costco jacking it up, it was the producers. 

so i also see it as yea, meats gone up cause of inflation, but they also love raising prices when they now there is going to be a demand.

its all fucked right now, i just also see it as them just using it as an excuse to go even higher. cause fuck it.
JPOW's gonna save us again... For the 50th time... Eventually
Pro tip, earnings are not what go in your ear
You retards need to get Teligent. You don‚Äôt have enough teligent. If you were more Teligent. You‚Äôd make more money.
You thought it was smart to have a 20% put position in SPY when it was down to $430? 

Sorry that‚Äôs how you interpret my comment. Feel free to move along instead of being angry about someone else‚Äôs win.
I made $1800 doing day trading and then lost buying NXRP.,sh*t
I feel a little consolidation tomorrow around 440 is not only likely but healthy after such a large run up. Thoughts?
TSM go on a bull run pls
I actually sold at 60 back in September and rebought today. I actually thought I was selling too early back then, but it worked out great
Getting a chubby!!! CRSr will be my new slqt!!! Stupid overreactions. Buying shares and leapers
Sofi gonna pop hard might be done up and down
My leveraged portfolio loves it when bonds are down and stocks are up
He bought? Dump eeet.
Your a week late
That‚Äôs my boy! Tendies for you tomorrow.

On the real though, with such a huge gap up from spy, a little consolidation would be normal and debatably healthy.
Best friend died this week bro 45, I miss him but he would tell me ‚ÄúBuy the dip F‚Äù RIP Jimmy Jim
Lol. Fukin degen
SOFI is hot. Glad this company is finally getting the recognition it deserves. Expecting it to reach its $25+ price target.

Bought some VZ today. Not a stock that I‚Äôm super interested in but it‚Äôs too cheap not to own now.
POST THE SDC GAIN PORN WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING ON
Mannn you know what‚Äôs crazy I was a bear once. Worst time of my life. Right after Covid hit and thing dropped and it was looking bad so I bought puts and lost a lot of money. Never again. Have been a bull since and making money. Downvote me idc but you bears need to switch sides. Stocks only go up. Yeah it makes no sense. Inflation ect but they will continue going up and you will lose money. Cash gang too. Be a bull, I promise it‚Äôll be better

Still like it. Could have a big special dividend next year, but have to ride the waves since shipping stocks have wild fluctuations.

Guys spy was struggling to go up today üòÇüòÇ were going to have a slow down trend tmrw to cancel it out because it‚Äôs pretty!! üåàüêªüåà
Their problems are because of supply chain issues, seen across the market. I don't see why MMs would bail now

My 10/15 puts are 20% of my spy. I didn't come on here looking for a compliment on my calls. Everyone killed calls today.
What‚Äôs so good about squid game? I watched the first 3 episodes and then I skimmed through each episode until the end of the season. It was alright.

Don‚Äôt blame you for rage quitting. I wouldn‚Äôt make it dealing with these people for more than a few days.
$441p on SPY tomorrow. Am i fucked?
i remember it being good at one point is that weird or did something change
Nah I had puts I was holding overnight to sell and buy calls. I had 40 10/15 436 calls but the resistance made me think (hmmm I can probably scalp a few k on way down during the morning dump and buy calls tomorrow). They got blown up by open. My $3600 in BABA puts were green but then reversed into red.

I've put my last 2.5k in 1DTE AMZN 3310 calls which will probably expire worthless tomorrow. Used all my day trades so this will be my last hoorah. I'm not manually selling them unless they hit 3350 but they'll probably get sold regardless
I mean I feel retarded selling my calls on open, but even I couldn‚Äôt FOMO back in, but I had to take a position so PUTS it is baby, so far like 9/10 for my kangaroo spy options I‚Äôve been playing
Sdc are we still strong?
Traps aren't gay you're safe.
I understand the underlying logic of the position. It‚Äôs mostly a short term hedge on my overall portfolio to take advantage of spikes in volatility that are bound to happen.
Money isn‚Äôt replaceable
Dude a foot tattoo is a high stakes bet why wouldn‚Äôt I follow through on that? Also a win is a win! Some dude told me not to get that foot tattoo if I lost and told him to fuck off and blocked him. Let‚Äôs not make assumptions I would have got the tattoo.

Id take the spike then sell it at open.
Just so you know the UVXY is a decaying asset and ultimately always finds new lows until the next reverse split
if you lost money today, you are in a league of your own.
Because most people say "I made a nice gain". Not stroke their own dick in the mirror looking for compliments in a subreddit full of gamblers.
I've been learning more about options, and - despite seeing the terrifying loss porn on this sub - I think I might just fuck around and buy my first options contracts tomorrow.

Which contracts? I'm thinking AMD calls and MVIS puts, but haven't decided on expiry date or strike price
I‚Äôd almost agree with you aside from the obscene toll it takes on our healthcare workers. 


I‚Äôm a healthcare worker and I rage quit my job for the first time ever on Sunday. 


Not to mention the inordinate amount of care and resources and time that a covid pt takes up in the ICU. They are much more medically complex than a simple stroke, stemi etc recovery pt.

realistically CRSR could actually go to $-850 per share at this rate
Yea u/ZJZ what gives dawg?!
Expired today? I had a feeling this smelled like BS.
No not at all
No amount of RGB can save CRSRs taint now
crsr leaps first thing in the AM if it stays where it is now, no brained
you buy and eat your veggies before 10am you can start with your martinis at noon.
Don't worry it's fine
Wait for tomorrow.
It was over $27 for the first time in a while though!

Can you use RH to do PMCC?
, we believe that our 2021 net revenue has been held back at least 10% by global logistics and supply chain issues, especially by the lack of affordable GPUs in the retail channel. After a slower start to the third quarter of 2021, we have seen a return to more typical seasonal ordering with September being the strongest month in the quarter.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs a result, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021, we expect net revenue to be approximately $391 million. Based on what we know today, we are also updating our 2021 annual net revenue guidance to $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion. We intend to update our 2021 guidance for Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA when we release our third quarter earnings release on November 2, 2021,‚Äù concluded Andy Paul.

My guess spike market open then drop to 440 and sideways for the rest of the day. Too many 450 calls bought up to let it do another 1% up day.

Lmfaooooo
Old trades deep in the red, new trades not producing enough profit to cover losses üòÑ
It's monthly option expiration which normally means they are trying to smoke out the calls. However, lots of put buyers this month... might be a face ripper
Right there with you. I have 10 439.

I read the release, I just hate that I'm bagholding, luckily I can sell covered calls so I'm not sweating it

You realize people are still working from home, right?  And that's going to continue to be the case. This is just a supply chain issue for them and has nothing to do with the demand not being there.

They're just the first of many companies that are going to need to adjust guidance due to shortages. As long as the sector continues to grow (it will) then they're a great investment long term. Buy leaps or shares. People panic selling are actually retarded and anyone that knows shit about fuck knew they were going to have a supply issue.

I can't believe that I actually closed out my $442c expiring tomorrow with a profit that I bought on Monday.  almost took that 80% loss yesterday.  But then I always say "wait", patience will be rewarded, before having said call go to $0.  What's the move tomorrow?

God damn it I knew it
Only way I‚Äôve made this month is buying SPY calls in low days, and puts on high days.
Just tell me when to switch to Puts, I may actually listen this time.
Hahaha get fucked. America wins again.
You guys aren‚Äôt winning this war
dont be surprised if you loose an arm wrestling comp.
Yeah wait till the dude finds out how many genders we got now
i worked in their meat dept for about 2 years, there was always price inflations, multiple times ive seen ribeyes at 60-80 range during holidays, they used to always price change during those times cause they knew people were going to buy, now with 'supply issues' its like the perfect storm to just increase it. 

but everytime i mention that i guess idk what im talking about, even though i firsthand dealt with it lul
You made me lul so hard üòÇ
U mofos been losing money on meme stocks and I been riding the $NDAQ gravy train the last year üí∞ üöÇ

SPY volatility is the only way I‚Äôve made money recently, let‚Äôs keep the boat a rocking.
On its way
Hmm no clue if they have one.  I'll need to check.
Trap me harder then ü•µ
So CRSR announces they‚Äôre beating expectations and are doing well despite supply problems that should be priced in and it drills? Time to average down
Lmfao a man can dream. That would be an absolute best case scenario tho. I‚Äôm not expecting to see 180 until some time in 2022
Alright guys, so next Wednesday at the dip we buy OTM calls so we can make money on Thursday.

Supply Chain doesn't have much to do with Tech. Bonds are down a good bit the last couple days though.
Is $PROG move over?
My calls are only down 15% now.

Daring to dream of success right now.
I just like to see all the animals at auction and fresh baked goods/meats, but my farmers market is probably realer than yours.
do y'all remember the guy who doubled downed on UPST puts when it was a bit over 100 in August? well now it's 383. WHAT THE FUCK
Can we do that again. Please.
If a sales lady is üî•ü•µ are you more likely to spend your companies money on her sales pitches?

I guess, it will, more catalysts on the way

on a side note, the women that go these markets look a bit rough.
Crsr really stuck it in my ass with no warning, no lube, and didn‚Äôt even buy me dinner
RIP crsr and spce
Glad I bought some 1DTE SPCE puts to hedge my long calls.
Girls love that attention
SPY stays flat tomorrow.
Moderna üêª don‚Äôt like this shit
My CRSR average is like $17 and I def should‚Äôve sold at 40
Plan tomorrow is to watch SOFI get pinned right below 20 or hope it pushes through to 25. Been a solid week.
oh, yeah. A growth company that says they are going to slow down significantly is totally a buy.
Max bliss = 450
They've been over $40 for a minute
So r u buying tomorrow or act like a pussy
Futures rn give me hope on my 445 call.
Tech leap calls slightly OTM fuck everything else change my mind

Over a period of seven years all your taste buds are replaced. This is continually happening.
You ain't working her hard enough if she's waking up at 6am lmao
Imagine literally doing it for the gram
They got calls for Oct, Nov, and Dec. 50 Million worth. Based on what I'm seeing, 450 likely. Call me crazy. My account doesn't care.
Imagine being locked up from 1998 to 2021, the mind fuck would be insane
Born and raised in Waterloo, ON- I‚Äôll never touch that stock again.
Went to Costco today, a pack of steaks went from $40 last year to $80 today. Feels poverty man.
No it‚Äôs not. Enjoy your bags with some tofu.
SPY stop climbing AH you fuck
No pain tomorrow only bliss
I lost money several times on it before it dawned on me that they are just cashing out at the peak. Nobody is going to need as many shit from crsr as they did back when everyone worked from home for quite a long time.
So they can post on social media

Yup
I ain't ever doubted
He claimed $450 by 10/15 I think
Yeah that's exactly the thing, the cloud stocks that are working the best are the ones that have completely detached from any sort of logical metric.  NET is another one that's just skyrocketing on nothing except hype.

You'd expect at some point reality hits and these stocks correct, but I think we're about to enter the blowoff top for them over the next couple months.

What‚Äôs max pain on Spy tomorrow?
If we dont dump tomorrow I will admit that bears are gay.

I used to like eating ass. Still do, but I used to too
not really, lol I bought them today hahaha
Good people
Welp guess I'm selling Covered calls against CRSR. Fucking fuck. Bought that shit on margin too yesterday for 26.40
It's also plenty easy for them to lose plenty of value pretty quick, and with more DTE it at least has a good chance to breakeven or profit, especially with SPY

My spy 445 10/18 is booooooooomin. Probably selling it tomorrow come market open. And my last minute 442 call early this morning was a savior to all my put positions. Broke a little less than even
I would wait until global supply chain issues look like they will be resolved soon
That dumb fuckin kid who opens their mouth and ruins it for everyone.  No one wants to hear shitty estimates‚Ä¶ why would you ever release that as a company- ‚Äúhey look how shitty we might be by end of year‚Äù mother fuckers
Doubt it. 440p OI is higher than 440c by about 10k. The next high OI strike for SPY is 450c. Holding 443 all day would be the best advantage.

Was it the up 1.68% today that gave you the feeling?
CRSR drops 2$ minutes before I get the notification of funds deposited so I can buy even more. I'll chalk this up as a win. 

Thanks, universe.
We will see who is going to be the greater fool tomorrow
Y'all ever notice as you get on in life that your tastes change, or maybe even they come and go? See I used to like onions, well, I'm not sure I liked 'em but I didn't mind. But now I ain't like onions anymore. Maybe I will again someday but I couldn't say when

I‚Äôve made good money off my shares and calls myself but will be a decent sized realized gain that I‚Äôd rather not pay short term gains taxes on, but if they do get exercised I will just look to re-enter at the next decent dip which will happen at some point.
It's gonna keep ripping until i buy in, prolly
.15% massive run lol
Guh as I look at my losses
Thinking about maybe getting into some FFIE. Low  shares, high SI% and CTB.

Seems like every company that's been shorted to oblivion is being sued by dozens of law firms for causing loss to their investors. Wouldn't it make more sense to sue the short sellers since they are often responsible for devaluing the investments?
No I own it and it‚Äôs done for. At most it will be lucky it gets to 30 next year.

Thought his 450s were for Nov? Might be ok. Maybe.
No clue when it will go up, but absolutely zero percent it will have a good week until 2022

*uff* down 60% on SPCE
MOASSSSSSSSS üêç
Google i def think will. Their revenue is growing the fastest, by a large margin. MSFT I wonder about. it's share price is almost totally detached from reality. will it continue its current trend, or is reality going to hit shareholders at some point?
Under $440 by open.

My calls are feeling so flyüöÄ
All fucked
I agree but today's action really reminded me of the start of how last year's run started.

Doesn‚Äôt mean it will work out but look at stocks like NET and TWLO and compare them to stocks like FSLY and BAND.

Direct competitors and yet the market is giving winners way higher valuations now.  Look at CVNA vs LOTZ.

Of course I could be completely wrong, but right now it looks like all the volume is going to chase the winners or stocks near ATHs.

If that comes to pass then I'd expect we see GOOG/MSFT continue to outperform other big tech at least for a couple months.
How is this shit not priced in?  It's only down 60% from all time high...
imagine still being in that hos pump and dump
This is the way

For those wondering about Corsair. Net revenue is expected to be down about 10% citing global supply chain issues and gpu prices.
Lowered guidance I think. Still kind of an overreaction
SPCE is garbage they are flying a flight with all manual controls in 2021, even 1980s Boeing airliners have more automation. This is because their original designer Burt Rutan while brilliant hated computers and they don‚Äôt have anyone who can build a better design.
Down on 2021 annual net revenue guidance revision to $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion. Compared to $1.9 to $2.1 Billion
Anyone else sell covered calls on their SOFI at 20$ thinking there‚Äôs no way it climbs all week after the early hulk out? Now here I sit dangerously close to being exercised on my most confident position üòÖ
you're probably fine
Dummy
Ur scarin me
I don't think we see $450 tomorrow, but I feel bad for SPY $450 guy. He really was in the right direction. I should have grabbed some lower strikes though.
Definitely buying shares
I believe today would be confirmation. OPEX might slow things down, but looking pretty bullish from here.

i like to personally sum up this entire escapade as a conflation, or perhaps conflict, between principle and practice, on all sides: in principle, I find employer or government mandates for a medical treatment in which there is zero legal liability for the manufacturer  for negative effects, even if it were 100% proven to be willful negligence...problematic. 

In practice? I signed up for that shit ASAP, chip me, idgaf, I'm trying to hit the club

Edit: now that I think about it I think most failures of government policy are borne as a result of willful ignorance of the practical outcomes in lieu of head in the sand worship of the principle behind them
Anybody looking at John Deere? Apparently all their employees are going on strike, so it might be a huge price drop soon

down so much rn, saved some by buying at 24.40, then it bounced to 25.30 a second later and  I sold, then it crashed again. 300 shares   sold a 25p 10/14/ and some 10/14 $27.5 calls I sold

overall down 4.5% on the day  (6.7%) from day peak
I‚Äôm gonna buy as many contracts as possible on BLU
OKAY NOW MY DAY TRADES ARE A GO TOMORROW!
God damn you see what happens!?
CNBC is pumping.
We could be on a crash collision with the biggest fuck off asteroid ever and SPY would be hitting ATH
I can just imagine CRSR 10/15 put holders being depressed all day, looking at their phone right now, and having one single tear of joy rolling down their face.
Ideally QCOM will rocket to 180 after earnings and the massive rally will cause IV to spike 69 points.

I have fond memories of going to a bar by myself while locked out of my apartment waiting for roommates, grabbing some food and drinks alone.
It would put mine ITM.

Ok so what CRSR has demonstrated is the classic wsb phenomenon. When you see a bunch of DD telling you to buy a stock now that it literally is about to rocket upwards it actually means to sell because it‚Äôs gonna tank.
‚ÄúGreat company‚Äù HA
Where the gay bears at?

AH pump, PM dump, then run all the way to 445 tomorrow.
You know, sales of a company is kind of a thing. Used to make numbers go bigger.
SOFI GUYS!  THIS IS THE WEEK TO BLOW OUT THE $20 CALLS!  We push it over $20 tomorrow and it would put the market makers in utter panic mode.  Get it to $22.41!  That is the par value.
I know for a fact there are brainwashed bears in here who keep doubling down on their puts swearing this market should crash. I‚Äôve been there.

I think it could pop before the end of 2022. Shit stock but highly volatile.

Their financials and business moves is what has me interested. The short interest argument is a factor but the float is so high that I don't think it's as important as people think.

Head and shoulder pattern,  prepare to get your dick knocked in the dirt.
Look at the stocks that did well today, it's a who's who of the biggest momentum stocks.

Cut losers and just buy winners.

Doesn't matter if a stock is up 200% in the previous 2 months, it's going to try to go up another 50% in the next month (looking at you UPST).

Stocks that are breaking to ATHs right now are probably the best bet because this time of year is when all the big hedge funds crowd into winners to show good numbers/stocks on their year end reports.

We've seen that happen in previous years: last year it happened with stocks like TSLA, NIO, SQ, battery stocks like PLUG etc.

Coming out of a major dip like this late in the year, that type of crowding should be exacerbated.

Stocks like CRM, AFRM, and of course among the big caps: GOOG and MSFT (which have been the 2 most bullish of the big caps).

Looks like we're going to witness a rotation into winners for the last 2.5 months if we break to new highs on SPX/Nasdaq.
Holy green candle on $ME!

Threw a ban bet to 425 for tomorrow but stacked on some FD 445c for .47 lol see y‚Äôall in a week
CRSR:

Despite this backdrop of growth, we believe that our 2021 net revenue has been held back at least 10% by global logistics and supply chain issues, especially by the lack of affordable GPUs in the retail channel. After a slower start to the third quarter of 2021, we have seen a return to more typical seasonal ordering with September being the strongest month in the quarter.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs a result, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021, we expect net revenue to be approximately $391 million. Based on what we know today, we are also updating our 2021 annual net revenue guidance to $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion. We intend to update our 2021 guidance for Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA when we release our third quarter earnings release on November 2, 2021,‚Äù concluded Andy Paul.

CRSR heatstroke
SPY 450, I'm sorry I ever doubted you. Can we still be friends?
My first move to invest in a beer into my belly! It'll be green from there!
Where is that guy who made the Corsair post yesterday ? Someone ban him for being annoying and wrong.
Back up now
How are you doing in that role?

"Corsair Gaming Announces Preliminary Third Quarter 2021 Financial Results and Updated 2021 Financial Outlook"
We gonna end over 475 this year unless big boy earnings coming up throw a wrench in it which seems unlikely.
Y'all don't know when to stop Kang ganging and it shows
Hell yeah. Lots of commons. Prob still won‚Äôt recover on my 10/15 17.5 calls though. I way overpaid for them months back :( and stupidly I exited half at a 50% loss yesterday, too.
since spy is up after hours, i‚Äôll admit i lost 70k the past 2 days from puts. i did another yolo on calls. if i lose money again, i‚Äôll prob quit

GUH on CRSR

Zero chance
Me and the boys (SDC bagholders) are getting together tomorrow. We're gonna knock a few back and reminisce on the good old days (last Thursday)
CRSR said the n word
I'll hold yours, if you hold mine
Apparently keeps ripping in AH
Will buy 2 green dildos today. 1 for me 1 for my wife.
Lol someone just did a massive sale on CRSR and bought the dip probs the same entity.
Hey bears, they're hiring Blowjob Technicians at major truck stops around the country right now. Might be an easier gig than buying puts.

Nobody cares abt CRSR 


go SPY go!!!
Everyone figured out the monthly pattern, whether it was related to OPEX, Fed meetings, taper, inflation reports, etc. They had it figured out. We doing Opposite for October to keep people on their toes.
I went to a movie yesterday at AMC with the wife and kids. 

We were the only people in our theater room and I literally didn't see another person in the entire building when we were getting snacks, going to the bathroom, or coming and going....besides the single employee who was selling tickets and working concessions all by himself.

We're seeing the death of movie theaters. Ring the bell. It's over.
Nice
Did crsr trap more people today?
Thank god I closed my Crsr spreads today. Shit company
Imagine thinking the volatility is over
Fuuuuck QQQ is getting me horny
Thank you spy I missed this
He recommended wearing Depends while trading
My first move for tomorrow will be to wank as usual!!

idk I‚Äôm just a gambler
Holy fuck what is happening to CRSR AH
NVDA got me hard asf right now
You can basically kick the can down the road as long as you want, the risk is early assignment if it continues to break out.
Holy shit, /u/AxeManfromMA may get his wish.
Yes.
The price has not stopped going up after hours... Someone gave SPY a shot of adrenaline to recover from its September bear-oin (heroin) overdose
Hmmmmm...maybe time to turn Margin on.....
Finally mooning üöÄ
Nah no it‚Äôs not lol
It's fucking ripping AH with high volume than during the day. Nothing makes sense anymore.
ER. Missed sales by nearly 100MM and From the overall headline on ToS, seems like forward looking guidance was the equivalent of ‚Äúbuyer beware. Results may vary‚Äù

You know when your a degenerate and you have a call that expires tomorrow that‚Äôs up 259% and your like. It‚Äôll keep going up

CRSR looking like a lemming.
Where‚Äôs the screenshot from the ones held overnight? You‚Äôre telling me you only had puts expiring Wednesday and had none with longer expiration going into today?
Out all day. Whyd everything rip?
Corsair ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)

Helluva gap there, CRSR

If my wife knew how volatile my "investments" are she'd give me the Bobbitt treatment. I've been a cheap penny pinching fucker the whole time we've been married now I lose so much money some days. But on days that I win we go on dates and I take her to Pound Town. Some day she'll find out what a LoZeR I am.
I keep buying SNDL 2023/2024 leaps like a true retard even though I'm down 30% on the position.

What do people think of DRS where you register your shares directly with the transfer agent instead of leaving it with crooked bankers?
Bought a bunch puts on UPST
The hell is happening to corsair?
Alcoa beat on revenue and EPS. They are also going to be paying a quarterly dividend.
BABA back to 200 by eoy
We go to moon tomorrow babe
Fuck yes SPY.  FUCK YES.
CRSR down 7% AH, cant catch a fucking break with that stock.
Add another gme and some dirt cheap mvis.  Glad to see my bs calls on vlta disappear too
Close enough to EOD. I just want to feel like a true retard when they all expire worthless tomorrow.
Sure, agreed
Spy continues to rip ah just to rub it in. Lol get fuk bers
Meh we have opex tomorrow so we'll see, sidenote: it's not a loss until it's realized

Crsr you good bro ?
Wtf just happened to CRSR
[deleted]
I saw this young girl she smiling at me so I took her back to my place and I paid her fee. I took off her skirt and this she had a dong. I was bored as shit and since I paid anyway I sucked his dick and let him fuck me in the ass
UPST 400 before open tomorrow? üòÇ
just flat, aint no suspense after major fear has been lifted
Yo!? Who tf killed CRSR after hours?
I need a makeover
That would have been a much better idea than what I did. Sigh. Next time.
Open with all ur previously sold calls +1000%
That's sexual dysfunction homie. You should probably figure out why you're linking sexual pleasure to hurting a grown mans feelings.
CRSR lmao
Guys my ass doesn‚Äôt feel right
I‚Äôll post loss or gain porn in a week. :‚Äô 

Wish me luck
Newsflash: you still took massive losses even if your shit didn‚Äôt expire yet dummy
Agreed we‚Äôre gonna have an end of the year rally. Sept was a given to be red a lot of people knew it was but then also being heavy red for almost half of October. End of the year rally definitely in order. Debt ceiling CPI all that gotta be priced in by now
im a hot girl and im never fucking you

What is happening with CRSR?
End of decade maybe.
Oh Jack, draw me like one of your big moves tomorrow
I am Nigerian prince, pls send moonniii
i have puts and a call, itll be flat for sure
Adderall probably
Thanks bro I‚Äôm gonna do this
Monday I loaded up on 10/15 SoFi 18.50ps... Hasn't gone well so far.
Sorry sir your 30 day refund window has expired. Is there anything else you'd like help with today?
Sellers here have paper hands.

The question is what EOD tomorrow will look like. üëÄ

People been saying this market has been boring but idk - the suspense this week is great
Shifted from Spy calls to Spy puts mid day. A dump tomorrow would be amazing. I don‚Äôt even know what to make of the new Spy volumes tho
VMEO up 13% yesterday, another 6% today. catalyst was "just average" ER figures.  
might be a good short target to hold over the weekend.
Calling Bearshit on that one. I know you were holding outs overnight and got gaped. You‚Äôre like the Archduke of Bear kingdom here
Imagine me actually making money. Sold my HOG calls when they were up 300% yay me
sold my $18k stake in UPRO at close at a slight loss after being down 10%, SPY already going up in AH, but couldn't take the chance that it would tank tomorrow
It's a off day, contracts expire tomorrow dummy
What has Cramer recently recommended? Looking for some quality stock picks and I know he is one of the most trustworthy analysts. There is a reason why wsb loves him
God can't help if we're already in hell. Prayers...priced in üòà
This would be a pretty heavy fake out I think we continue tomorrow
I'm not saying this week, but towards the end of the year and early next year for sure ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Yeah. I‚Äôm not feeling to hot about this. I went in during the first major dip around 1:00 EST. I thought it would bounce back up to break 720 and if didn‚Äôt. 

I hope I don‚Äôt get fucked  since this pump is probably being baked into their earnings report for next week. Plus the RSI is at 73%
Wtf Is going on with UPST?
True but i think dip buyers need to be punished more before we start on our end of year rally to a blow off top i to next year.
nice cock and ball formation on GME AH
Very common among bers, don‚Äôt feel weird about it
Pro Tip for bears who own dogs (cough cashflow_ cough) - buy treats that are chewy, then you can split them in half for twice the treats - 50 ct? Just became 100.
Hey I made 10k today!
Read that as MVST at first
Or at least don‚Äôt complain or be surprised if they get exercised.
#WITNESSED!
I‚Äôm a dodger fan that‚Äôs impossible

A very satisfying thought is to bang a hot girl then to think of what her dad would think if he knew what his little princess did. It‚Äôs nice to have dominion over his daughter.
Me, net puts, got fucked so I averaged down. Wish me luck tmmr
Bears always get fuked eventually. Stonks only go up
Options on leveraged etfs are kinda shitty to trade imo
yes, TA looking good rn too, lower lows and higher highs
I mean if you wanna hold for like 10 years before they're actually doing stuff then cool but there are better places to throw your money tbh
Tomorrow for sure bears ;) 

Chase the dragon
The danger there is actually having 100 shares of a triple leveraged ETF if it breaks the wrong way.
So is BABA done ripping
Make a banbet about it
made way too much chili, which I wouldnt mind if its good but its mediocre and i have to give some to someone cause i could only store it in their containers and i dont want to seem like i pawned it off on em but also i lost another grand today

I am, but I‚Äôm buying puts
That's what I was thinking. Also, pressure is created in the opposite direction for newly written contracts in the other direction. OI is going up on both sides pretty near the money.
Can‚Äôt. AM expiration stops trading now. Whatever the SET price @ 10am tomorrow is all she wrote. Like a 65-35% overnight roulette wheel. So when I wake- fukd/no fukd. GL! üçª
Yolo‚Äôd my whole account on Tesla 850c for tomorrow. Margin call or mansion

Finishing with 54 pennies tomorrow you can put in your piggy bank convincing yourself you're saving money.
Shit, I'll even take 435 at this point.
Got puts yesterday and more today. Wish me luck
Just say you need a loan against your loan...
Completely wrecked on puts today, hate it
MVST upward trend.

I'm in 455 Nov 1st as well... that started as ITM 8/15 450's in Sept.
Maybe . But we haven‚Äôt seen this for almost 2 months and we haven‚Äôt stayed over 440 or about 2 months it‚Äôs about time we recover imo
You're not obliterated but I'd rather be on the other side of your trade
Thanks bro I really want to jerk off tomorrow
She‚Äôs a cutie. Lmao everyone thinks she‚Äôs a boy üòÇüòÇ
Borrow even more money from an even more dangerous loan shark to pay the first.
That was me before spy made it to 450, lost about 16k, used like 2k on puts in September and made back 10k, then made back 7k beginning of Oct, and about to lose it all again if spy keeps pulling these gypsy shenanigans. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Last minute inside buying
Inversing wsb with SoFi $21p 10/29. Let‚Äôs see how this goes tomorrow :o
Picked up a chunk of SQQQ today. What goes up ...
If you're not in on SOFI, you're a retard. This shits about to run to 25 and then moon once they get bank charter.
I'm convinced some of you are sniffling paint thinner
I keep finding myself rolling profits from shorter-dated options into longer dated calls. Probably should pull some out, but that bank charter announcement is going to massive when it happens, and I want to position myself accordingly.
Bear COPIUM

It's a hedge, as soon as Opex passes tomorrow that's gonna drop like crazy and any there won't be much downside pressure.
You can simplify things and just wire me the last $1,500 to keep you from further heartbreak.
Thank you grandpa Joe
Does it continue tomorrow or was today another fakeout
I believe UPST got brought up in bank Earnings call or something.
Gonna rip tomorrow

I picked up some spy puts before closing. 420 strike
They did for one day, taco Tuesday took it up like 14% after hours maybe last June?
not what you wanna hear
Lmao godspeed you üåàüêª
I‚Äôve been waiting for this spy movement since the begging of sept this is the run back to 450
400+ tomorrow
I've prayed to every God known to man, so I hope you're right.
Huge amount of put hedges on tape.

Makes me think it's just going to open completely flat, pump a tiny amount then get pinned.

Pretty sure SPY gonna make a new ATH in the next 2 weeks because it HAS to rally if it's not being sold off
Lost 12k on puts over the last two days like a moron. Down to my last 1500
Bro that's good now sell before tomorrow hits and you'll be fine.
That‚Äôs not a bad rate.
Can't be greedy on the strike you sell
So how fucked are my (2) $TSLA 10/29 $825 calls are going to be tomorrow?

 I paid 25.00 each contract.
Upst took me from 12k to 20k in 3 days what do I do should I sell oh god this is killing me why couldn‚Äôt I just lose money instead

Tomorrow another great day for SPY hopefully.
Hey, anyone have any advice for how to deal with a loan shark? He‚Äôs really mad I don‚Äôt have his money yet but I told him I‚Äôll have it when the market goes down. He‚Äôs being really unreasonable imo.
My sin. O DTE spy puts at 3:59.
The ladder
Bahahah oh silly bears.  When will you learn?  Stonks only go up!
PSFE I'm proud of you. That's 2 days in a row you didn't puke up your gains to close. Now if you could just do that (checks brokerage) for the rest of the year, we might just be ok.
How just how
445 here ü§ûüèª
I feel 95% have given up since the beginning of the year. Come to lose money, stay for the shit posting
Could‚Äôve been up 160% today if i wasn‚Äôt playing scary. Ended up 57% instead
I‚Äôm still in it, but I am hoping for at least 1 more big pullback before November‚Äôs bank charter announcement so I can load up on cheap calls.
Yup. Put on a nice SPX 2dte 1SD IC last night. Hasn‚Äôt failed 9 out of 10 in the weeklies. Had a few close calls this week. They got me today. Is ok. Put on an AM. Se what happens.üçª

Picked up AMC puts at the high today. Fuck that stock, hope it crashes to $10 again and they go out of business. Or at the very least drop back to $35 and make me a couple grand.

got rekt by spy poots today
Over a $7 pump on SPY the day before opex...either someone is privy to some juicy info or this was the greatest bull trap of Octobear.
I did and I'm literally down 10% on JAN 150p

The crash on this is gonna be huge. It's at like 90x P/E right now and there is zero possibility that earnings will support this move.

I'm thinking it pulls an AMD and crashes back below $140 but not sure when


But honestly I'm pretty sure it's gonna just go to $200
Yes
Thursday is the best trading day.  So many 1 day options to buy for Friday.
Did we break over resistance with such a strong day today or no
How could they acknowledge it without also acknowledging this run-up is both fraudulent and homosexual
Me tooo hopefully China invaded Taiwan tonight
[deleted]
Was the massive increase because of California stimulus? If so then that would be really bad for tomorrow when everyone put money in then a sell off occurred.
Nope because the degrade faster than spy ie I was gonna explain but figured you would learn better if you googled it. Moral of the story only poots on triple levered etfs
\#UPST today gained 10%, wtf is going on???
Wow, someone is responsible
Good day today. Taking a break!!
Too many bad entrieS today. I'm short SPY. Should've held onto my calls longer this morning after passing $439.8  resistance and breaking 90 day downtrend
Watch my Puts print ü•∞
Today is so boring. Sold most of my positions and felt empty now ü§ß

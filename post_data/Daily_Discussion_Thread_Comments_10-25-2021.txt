anyone else looking at RELY? seems like a good long term and a decent pullback after IPO
No idiot, what you do is go in there for your shift get your free meal of chicken tenders THEN walk out
Me too ü§£ you try and warn them
MVIS reporting on the 28th... u have to be in it to win it!!!
Dear Zuck,

please dont cuck.
feces or faeces, f√¶ces is archaic but fun
or take other tendies from stocks doing great today?
I lost 150 can I have it back please
Doesn‚Äôt he do that like every other day?
Good luck to everyone playing earnings this week
Logitech puts &lt;3
Same thing tomorrow Tesla?
BA went green after being a giant turd all day
He does that every few months anyway
Oh, never mind.  I get it now.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
&gt; You should wait.
I was right about OCGN today! Woot wooooot!
Or their own internal ad platform is enough. They are so far reaching with their analytics, I would be surprised if they're impacted at all.
Dude, take your profits.
would also like to thank stupid Apes for paying my rent each month.
BABA DIAMOND HAND DEGENERATES
+51.50% on GNUS today, broke $2.00 first time since June. Well goddamn.
Profit taking on an excellent stock is ok! This means people will use that money to invest again and again.
I'm laughing my ass off at all the people earlier who were piling into DWAC. Ya'll should've learned by now that anything related to that jackass turns to shit.
Why did my mango rot?
SPY has gotta drop by a few dollars some day soon here, I mean damn
Yolo on fb puts
Everyone who ever sold a Tesla share regrets it today. Probably won't be much selling now.
Why? Any good news? I got 40c 12/17 i picked up at $33.
PayPal.  More like Gaypal.
good day fellas, bears hope the rest of your day still sucks.
üòé
LMT after hours tomorrow, selling more F-35s to Europe and 3% yield. Boomers want another war
Spamming people with Facebook disinformation at the buzzer to help zuck pump my calls!!

Cathie Woods sold TSLA on Friday.

Sad.
Is that the correct spelling?  Oops.
After messing up thursday, I am NOT selling before close today :)
F
BABA has no idea what it wants to do
&lt;3
FB is going to fuck everyone, both ways.
We can be pussies together.
suck a dick to whoever doubted my banbet BNTX $300 this week guranteed
Cant wait to see fb implode
FB dump on earnings is all but assured.

So it'll definitely not do that.
[deleted]
There‚Äôs like no more room for FB to tank. Only up. $340 FB tomorrow
Last chance to get those fb puts
I suspect anyone who is short GES will be covering very soon
How many retards are slapping the 1500 TSLA expiring Fri
Everyone‚Äôs cashing out?
can see fb banging to 375+
I bought 11/19 $200 $NET calls sept 30th. I‚Äôm up about 2000%. Should I close them now or wait since I‚Äôm about to be ITM and have three weeks left?
The good part with Tesla right now- there will be profit takers for a period of time, but we all know it can get back to its all time high. 1,045 is achievable. Tesla provides a great product and it‚Äôs only getting better. Get in now or stay out and work at wendys.
The TSLA frenzy in here today is making me nostalgic.
I want SPCE to go down
Waiting for my fb calls to go up in flame in er
I‚Äôm just buying for the run up to earnings really, not holding
My guess is that today's contracts will become OI tomorrow.
Its @2PM PT https://lumen.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1497720&amp;tp_key=1a099cec3aand
Fuck it, picked up some FB and UPS calls.
OMG imagine
They are not doing rocket science, with experienced devs, sysops you can build something like this in 2-3 months, given a lot of budget and management that listens.

Open source is not bad, you can only look so far because you are standing on the shoulders of giants. If they give back this is a win win.
Don‚Äôt let me down FB
Wtf going on with tsla
F√¶ces
DWAC ‚ö∞Ô∏è for üíº holders
You made money. That's a W
Real slow and methodical?
In 3 minutes I will know if I am banned for next week lol.
Sold my Tesla shares a month ago. You are all welcome
Too much FB positivity in here. Not jumping into this
F
üÖ±Ô∏èkkt all in with TSLA gains
You realize that's like $100B + outflows in 3 days?
Lol Ik. It‚Äôs just hard to not be annoyed when that much money is left on the table
LCID be scootin today
&gt; Facebook Inc. (FB) will report earnings on Wednesday after the close, and results are expected to be strong as user growth continues unabated.
Very retarded trade. Burn that money next time instead.
What‚Äôs bad about that
A few shares and a bunch of calls(not way OTM).
Double ban
TSLA $1400 EOY IS A FACT
BUY THIS TSLA DIP! It will hit 1100 tomorrow
&gt; No, you are not crazy.
SPY 460 EOW
Tis the season
It‚Äôs going to close at 41.50
[deleted]
Yes. TSLA $1400 EOY
Fb earnings call is at 5 but when do results get released?
Already all over the front page
You misspelled McDonald's. ü§¶
Got my üçøand waiting for FB tendies‚Ä¶ i canceled the trailing stop loss. Am I crazy?
Imagine not selling 220% IV
the rumors are true...even scarier, its produced for them, in many cases, a "profit", wherein their initial investment is worth more than their cost to purchase at the time of sale
What?
fuck me like zuck
Why would I? Seems like easy money

Edit: Made about $850, not bad.
Selling some of my low quality meme stocks from Friday for losses. In case they keep tanking throughout rest of week
I think, today and tomorrow, it really is as simple as buying TSLA calls. Better keep a day trade handy if you're poor and have sub 25K in the port.
F
Just be careful of brazilian currency losing value. Even if oil goes up, if the Real declines in value the stock will go down in USD terms
FB put volume is humongous
You got it.... Loading PUTS

FB going to 400
If you didn‚Äôt loose money, you‚Äôre winning.

I know you‚Äôre joking but I bet puts gain in the 15 minute after hours
Old money, new money, retard money. Those are your options in this world
My options sale is not being filled too bad I was greedy
Yes.
It‚Äôll be back in a week, I got it on sale
FB earnings LFG
Fb will tank on earnings then run up like nflx a few days later
well smoll depression &gt; big sad
I was up $3000 but I didn't take my profits
Jack Ma needs to rescue BABA
Definitely going to rip in tomorrows pre market
What weeklies to buy for us poor folks
Hey guys is it true people are buying calls in a pandemic at the end of a natural credit cycle ???
What's the facebook Play?
Made and lost 10k; so nothing
fb position?
When is the last time SPY had a proper power hour?
My resignation letter tomorrow should TSLA go up any amount.

Everyone holding their breath for FB earnings.

If it dumps it's going to 260 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Did the exact same thing. $345 calls for 10/29
Fuck this all in GME shares selling at $350
alright i did what i actually wanted to do on friday but was
too pussy. bought tsla 1250$ calls expiring december.
What‚Äôs Tesla opening up at tomorrow. $1050ish
Intel down, AMD up, that‚Äôs the way I like to fuck
And NOK
FB back to 330 before close.
They usually report strong earnings, then tank for a bit, then recover
RemindMe! 2 days
Mango probably won‚Äôt be able to
Take your 7x and relax. You made more in 1 day than most Americans makes in a week.
FB calls
Wow. You will regret that
I already did Friday on the dip waiting for earnings week ‚ÄºÔ∏èüöÄüöÄ
How's tesla chart looking like ? Any gaps
What the üí©. Want stonks to go up.
fb position?
Stfu TSLA to $10,000
Examples?
Puts on Tesla (buy calls ü§´)
It's going to moon if the xilinx deal closed
Asking the important questions
Come on mango. move
The market cap doesn‚Äôt actually mean that‚Äôs what a company is ‚Äòworth‚Äô. It‚Äôs what people are willing to pay for a share. It‚Äôs just a value of how much stock is in circulation.  It‚Äôs not like the company gets that money.
I made $150 today. Kill me.
PayPal is lame af
Lol
My guess is down. The 13 is the same as the 12. Can‚Äôt imagine ‚Äúbetter then expected 13 sales‚Äù
Yep, that's why I got 25DTE before earnings I'm expecting a 10 bagger in a week. X expected to report you may go 2 or 3 bucks OTM for at least 11 days out
They at least share tech.
In my heart I'm a gay bear, but I dont want to be! All this looks so bad, it's gotta crash, but I don't want it to!
That's a reckless contact you got there
üÖ±Ô∏èkkt to 100 tomorrow lets fucking go
Someone give me sure fire play, so i can do the opposite
Honestly though. Like we‚Äôre getting profit back and some have the possibility of selling CCs forever for free monies if we sell the right strike
Welp, I'm gonna get banned next week, someone's gotta be the voice of reason in my wake. Any volunteers?
PLUG you sweet beautiful bastard
Bro! You can‚Äôt say that word with the ‚Äúhard R‚Äù like that
Took my earnings from TSLA and dumped it all into FB for earnings today. I'll be back in TSLA after it dumps a little tomorrow. 

Let's see how this pans out.

Edit: I almost shat my pants when I saw it immediately dump after 4est, then it recovered. LOL

Tired of apple sucking ass. Which way is it going on earnings you think? Gonna sell my shares and yolo that direction
How many times ya think TSLA gonna get halted tomorrow ?
BANBET PUSSY
AUPH AUPH AUPH
Last thing I remember before the accident was pressing send on those $600 TSLA shares. Are they still around?
What did his shoe shine boy say?
All  my positions are green as fuck, but I decided to  force my luck and play FB earnings. It worked a few days ago with TSLA, we will see how it goes.
Yea my thoughts too lol. $50
Link?
age ?
apes
You truly think that? No ape? Buyout rumors?
Wut
Might see if it dips a bit into tomorrow 

Steel is going super strong though so I‚Äôm probably shooting myself in the foot waiting for the calls to get a bit cheaper
Mango ü•≠ pls save my port
When does Tesla switch from growth stock to overinflated bubble? üòÇ
FOMO‚Äôd. TSLA order waiting to be filled..

COiN to 400$ this week plsüöÄ
Elon deserves this
I want to buy AUPH but it seems like bag holders just want to dump on me
Legit had the same thought, most of the time would get fucked holding calls after ER but this time seems different, do you have any positions?
We will see
You know DWAC is a Chinese owned SPAC right? What better way to bring down America, help trump create social media, spread memes and conspiracy theories 

The right is too busy frothing at the mouth about masks, vaccines, and trans fucking bathrooms. America goes into domestic strife and whoops America is too busy to defend Taiwan all of a sudden

You idiots are sucking Xi's cock and screeching "freedom of speech, conservatives are being silenced!!!" With a mouth full of Chinese honey bear cum

PBR share price skyrocketed under Lula. The socialists won't hurt it because they need the money to pay for extravagant social spending. Bolsonaro is friendly towards the company as a free markets guy. It's protected by both sides because it's Brazil's golden goose. And even if we factored in some political risk, the company would still be undervalued relative to its peers.
It just ran 40% up last week
Ya don‚Äôt even try to logic it out or fight it. Just buy tsla calls‚Äîshit mooning to 1200 easily
Come on tesler rip to $1050
Who‚Äôs more retarded?  Permabulls or Bears right now?
It will fail
you're right that buying puts is madness

cant wait to get CUCK by ZUCK
Brazil is collapsing
Buy NIO before it‚Äôs to late
I bought in morning. Quick 50% loss and sold it.
Imagine people's face when people find out people who bought DWAC at &lt;$15 are selling covered calls for more money than they paid for the shares are being called bag holders.
What a lovely day.
Damn, COIN went nuts today too, but I didn‚Äôt even watch the market with TSLA just printing me tendies all day
It will only be the top until tomorrow
why did amd just get slapped from above
Lol
Yes
Facts! Those who think $SNAP earnings will play out like $FB‚Äôs are sadly mistaken. &amp;&amp; as you said, it‚Äôs wayyyy too obvious, I‚Äôd buy calls.
I guess Cathie selling all those Tesla shares really was a buy signal.
RIP to Facebook haters. Jokes on you Motherfuckers
Oh come tf on QCOM close over 132 ffs
You and literally millions of others according to the sell off on friday
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Same. I should have bought all the times I said "this looks like a good price" this year. Instead I went full retard and bought some OTC shit. Learning is fun.

DIAMOND HANDS FOR TSLA CALLS. LETS GO RETARDS
Gonna buy spy calls tomorrow, i just can‚Äôt do it today. Not after 10 straight Green Day‚Äôs
call it the tuck n zuck
This is relevant to my general interests. Hope you're right!
I hear you.  I‚Äôm right at the point in my portfolio where a nice slide is coming to reset me back to start.
got LOGI puts. pls baby jesus

Yeah you've got more like 30s with weeklies üòÇ good idea homie, enjoy!
I‚Äôd disagree
God I‚Äôm excited for this market close
IM NOT SELLING
It already tanked on snap earnings, unless its worse dont see why itd be a dump
Because it is underpriced
Raise your hand if you bought Tesla put in the morning. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§ûü§∑
Can TSLA go down so I feel less bad about selling my calls at open? Turned a grand into about 7K but they‚Äôd be worth about 26.5K right now. IF iTs GoOD eNoUgh tO ScREEnshoT itS GoOD EnOUgh TO SelL
Employer getting on my case? Not being able to talk about the case? Threats if it‚Äôs a bad case?

Thought that me having an engineering degree and a gambler would get me off the hook but here we are. I also got a feeling that this may not be a petty case.
A good rule of thumb for this thread is if you see a forward looking comment containing aeronautical terminology, stay far far away
Buy some Jan calls 5 percent out of the money
Because you didn't buy (or sold)
Why not take profits and roll out?
We don‚Äôt get too many second chances in life. Tesla might be the second chance.
Yeah the Apple-Snap stuff seems too obvious, plot twist will be fb has been making tons of money off Oculus or something
Everything is up except for PSFE. Fml
fair point
Last 10 minute push
why shouldn't it?
Guys what‚Äôs a good energy ticker to go long on ?  Xle?
I don‚Äôt care about ethics or politics. Only gains.
Dude lol
#TESLA WHAT THE FUCK
Been flat for 2 years. I could have save myself from anxiety and small depression
TSLA straight upwards trend, no dips. Inversing my logic and buying more $1500 calls exp friday.
Keep buying boys easy 100+ this spring
Am I the only one who think FB will tank when earnings come out?
SPY EOW 460 not looking quite as strong lol

I love how Mango stock options have 0 open interest across the board.

No one's taking *any* chances of getting assigned.

EDIT: No, I get it. lol Everybody chill.
Tesla managed to lighten some bags i sold at a lose.
TSLa running tomorrow?
Long or short DWAC? Into the close.
Guy‚Äôs probably getting harassed rn lol
Buy the top, yes, this is the way!
okay I approve then, may the best retard win
I‚Äôm gonna be referencing my ‚Äúrecent‚Äù hip surgery for the next ten years
I haven‚Äôt ever been more confident in holding Tesla calls overnight
Cashed out today at 13, got in at 7. So it will probably hit 50 tomorrow , youre welcome..
Why is Tesla mooning
Because they don‚Äôt actually have a product that‚Äôs live and 45 is a famous grifter who won‚Äôt care if it gets done now that they already made their money grab.
Typically AMD dips after earnings then shoots upward 2-3 days later. I‚Äôm curious as to what happens this time, as they really might knock this shit out of the park and also give optimistic guidance.
Holding 50 shares of FB into earnings. Should I buy some calls as well?
&gt; Tesla Inc. (TSLA) is an American automotive and energy storage company based in Palo Alto, California. The company was incorporated in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[5]
TSLA 1069.42
üÖ±Ô∏èkkt might gap to 50 overnight
im going friday
It‚Äôd be awesome for us regular dudes. But for someone like him I imagine it would feel empty.
Its time for a Big Short Sequel where Michael Burry just loses everything he owns after trying to short Tesla. Who says no?
This is just nuts.
Surprise. Surprise.
TSLA gap up overnight or sell
If people run to Hertz to rent Teslas, other rental companies will follow suit also. Never mind the possibility of corporate fleet sales.
With all the bad news you‚Äôd think puts might be the move, but the market is weird so I‚Äôd buy calls tbh.
Who's got the balls for some TSLA puts? Not me but I think this is madness right now.
COME
ON ZUCK KING
Spin the wheel through earnings.
I think the theory is they're going to pull an Overstock.com like June 2020. issue a cr*pto dividend and when market makers can't issue those dividends it gives Gamestop the right to recall their shares. Shorts are revealed stock goes up bigly 

There was just a court case where a judge ruled in overstock's favor about issuing that cr*pto dividend legality.

Bros take a look at PBR. 10% divvy. Biggest oil company in Brazil. Prints money basically. Great inflation hedge. Word is that its going to be privatized. Many positive catalysts.
Like Russian collusion.  Haha.  Like that really had facts
Neither. See what happens move in the morning.
Even though $FB has been getting dragged through the mug these last few weeks with all the bad news, I‚Äôd still load up on calls if I was playing earnings. Market be weird like that.

Hey as long as you recognize it's a casino
My FB 345c fds are about to print hard
Yeah I'm well aware. What fucjed me over was trading spy 0DTE. At least weeklies don't fuck you within 5 seconds lol. I'm gonna take a break. Buy a new couch. And just relax. Take a few days off work probably
IBM can go back up now. Dropped even further after earnings last week.
NAKED BABY

AYY AYY  AYYYY
Calls. $345 fds
and 2019 and 2018... TSLA was cool before you even started losing chunks of your portfolio on options.   


Clang gang role call in about 3-4 months as well.

Dumped 145 aapl calls and switched to 22c vix
My biggest positions are long held Tesla (since 2015) and long held DWAC/DWACW (5 days).  Financial media thinks Im a retard, but money dont lie.
Meaning, clown world.
It was a smaller position than everything else he made money on, he‚Äôs up a lot this year
Bruh.... Holy fuck


(It was at 999 when I sold them)
My thought was buy them now cuz legalization is inevitable
X reports Thursday AH and the $25c are still cheap
If I use my uno reverse card now I get all my money back right ?  Pretty much lost everything somehow.
Oh my gourd!

OCGN best covid vaccine in the WHOrld
I made nothing because I sold to early
When I said TSLA might hit 1T evaluation soon in yesterdays daily thread I didn't mean today that's for sure
Sitting in the tree stand buying FD's like the founding fathers intended
I don‚Äôt see his banbet?
Me too. How can I be successful in my job but shit at this?
I‚Äôve never been one to participate in memes, but how is it not obvious that DWAC is eventually going to $500+?
Anyone still playing FSLY?  $47c 10/29.  Take profits or roll with the week and continued uptrend?
Puts on both
What? 1billion √ó 7billion is 7 quintillion lol. Did you ever pass pre school maths?
You got ripped off

They could probably sell videos of people doing it in the car with the built in cameras
No way you pay retail when buying a fleet
don't buy a fast pass just use the retard line
Can Tesla go to $1100 by eod pls
Beware I made money today. The Outer Gods are about to break into reality.
Oh hell yeah. I was so nervous. I kept 10 of the 127 contracts open but closed those too like 5s later
SPY to 480 by 11/15!

I imagine so, yeah, but I don‚Äôt know when he bought them. 

I was just referring to all the comments about how angry he must be and how much money he must be losing

lol i went right. i hope its not another SNAP
Everyone is talkin about their big tesla gains, but im up $800 on my one spy call lol

I‚Äôm expecting FB to mislead everybody. bullish
Be nice, holding allot bags on this one.
My FB 325 calls mooned. Holding through earnings though, this FUD coming out right before earnings is hilarious.

Zero credibility is an optimistic definition of this sore short loser. üëÜ
I remember when I was a kid, my grandpa taught me that every product with a 'Made in China' label was absolute dog shit. These BABA calls proving him correct.
I prefer Prime Video and Netflix.

Hell yeah, fuck 'em
For a few days, actually. They did this in June (going by the daily charts). Then it crapped out after day 4/5 from the pump.
That's what Bloomberg said actually unless I misheard it.
Careful what you wish for
Oh üòí I wrote off anything positive happening with earnings a long time ago, so I honestly forgot it was today.
Streaming right to the in dash screen?

It used to be several times higher. Not very long ago.
LOGI or FB calls?
Okay OCGN blow my ass out of the water
I would assume the other rental car companies are going to have to follow suit maybe they wont all buy Tesla‚Äôs but some of them will
Someone sold me March 2023 $400c's on TSLA at a breakeven of $780/share in March this year ü§£ü§£ü§£
He is, but the bag holders in shambles
"alot of pain" for david faber
Not bad tbh
Own BRK.B shares to avoid jury duties
TSLA likes doing wild shit at the end of the day. üëÄ
the price justification is justified when u realize that price justifications dont need to be justified
1T is more than fair. Buying now is a value based on what it will be in 5 years.
I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll have such a massive drop even with bad guidance. SNAP deserved it imo I‚Äôve said this a million times on here but their ads suck bc of constant interruptions and watch time lower tremendously. Good luck bro if it doesn‚Äôt hit at least it wasn‚Äôt expensive af üôèüèª
Thanks Tesla. You can keep going if you want, I made enough for today.
I am DISGUSTED by my INABILITY to turn a PROFIT

Listen, hear me out. I'm making money off of Tesla, many here are, many are not 

But regardless let's just be honest here. As much as I like having 20k-50k profits on these random nonsensical jumps one thing is clear.

Everyone knows Tesla is NOT a $1 trillion company. It isn't. No way in hell.

Everybody in Tesla outside the most stubborn know this. I hope.

I'm making money off it so I'm not hoping that it will crash but it's inevitable it will. Because it's not a 1 trillion $$ company.

Now with that said, if Tesla jumps past $1100 and turns my 50k+ gains into six figures...I wouldn't complain.... Erhem.......
&gt; Yes.
Every clf call printing this thing doubles up infrastructure passes
Yup. Bad meme
To be a successful trader, you can‚Äôt have that mentality. All perspective, could‚Äôve been 10k or $56; so always be grateful for the bag and find the next big play  ü•Ç

It‚Äôs only going to get worse from here
100% although I am in for Dec and Jan.  Pre-dip I was rolling in nice profits.  Doubled down on the dip though with $290c 12/17.  My Jan 12 $300c are the ones hurting the most.
Hey it‚Äôs good if you‚Äôre sellin em.
My personal PT is $30 in 1 to 2 weeks.
IV is wild shit. Imagine buying a FB 327.5c at the absolute bottom today, stock moves 3% off bottom and you still don't have a 100% gain.
Marqueta might be the best blockchain/banking/crypto play in the market. Seriously.
i'm MOFO so hard right now. i have the chance and money to buy a lot of TSLA stock when it was $190 before split. instead i yolo it down the drain. my ex wife left me and took my daughter with her to be with her bf.
**If TSLA goes up tomorrow any amount I will finally quit my job**
Cmon spy, you know you want a good ol fashioned rip into close.

Apparently the Hertz has been in negotiation for a while. It was the financial backers of the company that pushed for this deal, and not the CEO.

You‚Äôre not wrong and I know they have a shit ton more acquisitions under their belt yadda yadda but again if they aren‚Äôt 100% grounded in guidance it will fall. That doesn‚Äôt sit right with me.
Definitely my most profitable trading day excluding gme
Technicals have no place here.

they‚Äôre pretty nice tbh

Don't buy anything I'm holding, fucko. Idk, buy DIS I guess. Momentum should carry you at least to the top of the channel around 180.

I'm glad someone other than me found a way to lose money on TSLA today
decent bet I‚Äôm pretty much doing the same, SNAP also said supply chain reduced the amount of ads companies were buying too
Maybe I will; eat cake while crying and watching Midsommar
all in on LOGI or FB calls?

Don't. Wait for 9am tomorrow to decide.
My $FB play for earnings is PUT debit spreads. 

I am buying FB $325 PUT and I am selling FB $320 PUT 

Total cost is $200 and max profit is $300 at $320. 

Hoping for a surprise Apple ad effect on earnings.
Brilliant. Everyone will use them for rentals so they can drive a Tesla instead of a Buick.
If there‚Äôs any slowdown in user growth it‚Äôll be the first since IPO (I think?) as well. That won‚Äôt sit well.

How long is the ban bet on this one
Spy gains wiped out by Tesla losses. Fucking fomo man
Not an Elon cultist but there's more to it than just the mere value of the sale. Bloomberg was saying it's free advertising for TSLA. People rent TSLA's from Hertz, get to see how great is (that's their presumption), then that would lead the renters to buy TSLAs.
I sold a TSLA 790 put (10/29) this morning when it was at $950. The position is red. IV has expanded massively. Losing despite 70 points of positive delta and the day of theta. Crazy.
Overpriced sneakers company going IPO? No thanks
It's going back to NAV lol.

I think you mean "catch wind"?
Any physical product that requires retail shelves is getting puts from me. I work in logistics full time, I‚Äôm not dumb.

We ready to moon or crash baby
Yea it‚Äôs a bit iffy but ya never know. May your calls be glorious as mine.
yeah, I'm hosed after earnings
y? it keeps hurting my enus
FB is a money printer.
You don't buy stocks for their value today. You buy them for the value in the future.  You seriously don't know this?
Hey Pakistani_fan is happy now.
TSLA situation is like a roulette game which has hit red 30 times in a row and keeps tempting you to bet black (puts/short) but instead it hits red the entire night

And then the entire week
That‚Äôs bearish no??
Holding FB calls into earnings because I love punishment
Abbvie calls are the play
Their PE is 470 as is lol
I shit on all spacs, no spacs gang for me. this is deemed untrue
Tesla 1100 tomorrow, load up boys. Once the boomers catch wind of this tonight on the news they won‚Äôt want to miss out on the next trillion
lol tsla IV is through the roof, even far otm options cost so much omg
TSLA  was the play...
Where have you been all day??
He said he sold the pits a while back
I should do the same lol

They already said that.. it‚Äôs why their not at ATH 380 lol
LOGI calls locked and loaded
My $85 on TSLA on Friday just turned into about $3500 when I sold my two 1100C

Might be worth it just to buy one or two cheap ones for next week
anyone know anything about allbirds? Just saw ipo nov. 3rd

TSLA blew past 1000 really
Yeah, you can read the entire thread above your comment. I think you were participating in it?
Ahhhh thank you
no... if everyone buys stocks everyone wins.... what r u smoking
Fb running up into earnings then 15% dump after hours
5m percent
Did fb earnings get leaked? Why the run up
It‚Äôs a slippery slope
If I can deduct unrealized losses I‚Äôll be golden.
Nice work, don't fuck it up, you could be right back to nothing in 5 minutes lol.
Hehe.

That‚Äôs why I bought calls for January and March and don‚Äôt play weeklies when M&amp;A is in the mix on a stock that has be in a downtrend anyway
no, please supply us with everything you want to buy, so we can buy puts
1400 eow for tsla isn't far fetched
large if true
no it's not, save most of your cash the key to investing is only invest in the very best things that come along buffet says reject 95% of stock picks, only pick good ones like JOBY and HOOD
Burry is playing the fuck out of those drums rn
QCOM go back up üò°

Markets don't crash because you disagree with it.  Find a system that can't maintain it's holding because of financial fundamentals. Like burry finding fraudulent CDO's with criminally set ratings. Find something solid like that. Not a gut fucking feeling.
Spy calls are always the move

If Tesla can be worth $1trillion so can my portfolio
It‚Äôs the future. TSLA, LCID, XPENG, NIO will all be big, well TSLA is already a MAMMOTH
Lol. This is clown world and I love it.  Hertz buys 100,000 Model 3 Teslas which start around $42,000/vehicle.  That means 4.2 billion dollars in vehicles assuming 100% profit and no overhead or having to pay fixed or variable costs.  Tesla is up 116 billion in value today on a 4.2 billion deal. This is amazing. TO THE MOON!
So will I
And a million millionaires on his coattails.

TSLA is nuts!!! Bezos in the pits
Yea but ARKK has holdings in a lot of other companies with earnings this week
True, and without holding any TSLA
It will bleed until you get that coveted Trump Tweet
If billionaires have to sell their assets to pay their tax bill, China will just buy the dip. It‚Äôs a very short sighted move. Greedy. Sad.

If DWAC goes back $45 it probably has some solid meme price support. Lmfao
I haven‚Äôt Yolo‚Äôd in a long time, I‚Äôm tempted
Facebook could come out on top as the biggest player. They were also ahead of SNAP on planning to mitigate Apple's IDFA changes to ad targeting. SNAP is caught flat footed and will need to solve it now... so \~10 months late to the party.
weeklies? or jan?
Buy those motherfuckers but for next week
God damn Elon Musk really is the short destroyer if there's ever been one
Dips. You fucking buy dips. In anything.
You misspelled BYND.
Holy shit, TSLA actually hit 1000
FOMO that $2700
Well, I‚Äôm definitely kicking myself for not buying the $1,000 Tesla calls I was looking at before it broke $900 a few days ago.
TSLA made me a net worth millionaire today ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Holy fuck I was down to my last 55k after losing over 250k and I just turned it into like 230k with tesla weekly calls on that run from 1000 to 1040ish. The adrenalin is nuts I can't believe I just turned my shit around in like an hour.
Leaning to the left tbh. These right wingers are nut jobs
Dump. Buy back in premarket tomorrow early and sell at open. Rinse. Repeat.
Tim apple can you at least post a toy car picture to pump your stock plz.
Its still over 10% of ARKK...

Been losing money consistently for weeks. Stocks literally crash soon as I buy. Please give me something to buy .
For a company that hasn‚Äôt completed the merger, based on the brand name of a media whore, who still doesn‚Äôt have any product, with a team that has no experience, and ripped off open source IP. It‚Äôs going to rip
#POWER HOUR
FB has me feeling weird. The graphs on it look like complete shit and has me wanting to buy PUTS but also kind of just wanting to stay away. I am hoping for a bit more of a run up from earnings so my $375c aren't useless
realized gains are gains, holding on too long is no gains, you gotta take them at some point
I actually want to cry right now, sold my Tesla calls for $2700 this morning worth almost $10k now 

FUCKKKKKKKKK 

I‚Äôm having trouble digesting this one
OH SHIT ZUCK HERE WE GO MOTHER FUCKER KING LIZARD MOTHRR FUCKER !!!
God damn tesla with the 30 baggers
Wait how did PYPL/PINS deals collapse?
Their earnings are tomorrow and it probably will shit the bed
Lol
I totally downvoted. (*Aside:* he‚Äôs probably right though).
Nice. Sell the news üóû
It'll be at 300 eow
Really hope so! üò©
They want to tax unrealized gains...look I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but this sounds just retarded
It‚Äôs not just that‚Äîit‚Äôs the Zillow‚Äôs and Redfins who bought 15-20% of some markets and tried to flip or rent them out.  When they can‚Äôt flip anymore or get the rents they desire, they‚Äôre going to dump the homes on the market
People who shit on CLOV bought DWAC at the top
Choice Zuck loss porn coming up tomorrow. It's gon be guuud

How long is gone for this time?
OLPX and XELA primed to rip.
Bc I have puts?  
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Thank God FB options are expensive, I won‚Äôt have to bother losing money
Olympic Steel can moon very quickly, 9 million share float and a 5 PE.
Link
what makes you think it will hit $1600 by friday, seems abit too much
Just lottos man
If fb doesn't moon tomorrow it'll fuck me outta all the gains I made today lol
I'm unwise, but I'm going to answer anyway.

Dump.
I wanna buy HOOD calls. Someone send help
my stock account is happy, going to refund my stupid options account tomorrow, not sure when it settles
QS making me green
Whats the deal with EV sector?
Where were you when Tesla hit a trillion market cap
Musk on his way to be the first Trillionaire?
Seems odd it‚Äôs up end of day going into earnings‚Ä¶when it‚Äôs been down all day long
leaps up 12%
Sold 2 TSLA $500 puts for Jan 2023. Fuck it
&gt; I'm not sure what theta gang is, but I don't like it.
[deleted]
I sold Tesla calls.....
Your flair gives me confidence in my choice
Did the numbers leak on $FB!?!
CMPS save me pls
Dump
When I said FB would ram my ass I didn't know I would discover I liked it, sweet Jesus
Selling puts bb
You feel good about earnings?
Imagine playing theta gang while everyone runs around frolicking with TSLA gains slapping me in the face.
50,000%
I'm having a 12-13% kinda day.
Ocgn leaked WHO approval documents dated wednesday, now is the time to buy calls.
No. But at least it's a $WISH that comes true.
Give it a week, it‚Äôll get there
It was those turds over at /r stocks ü•∂
More like 3 years ago
Running out of shaft with that one.
But why?
Usually have 3-5% cash on hand so I can get the trade in immediately and then decide if I‚Äôm going to liquidate something else. 

At this point I‚Äôm also selling a shit ton of covered calls every week
Holding FB 10/29 400c only a few though
Sure, I would argue the opposite though.  I think that they get where they are in the payments eco-system and have been building that with different products including cr@@tpo and pre-paid debit cards, small business loans, etc....  
Smart money says that they look at other industries to cross-polinate.  I know we'll get back to $300 a share, just sucks (for my calls) that we got knocked down on rumor.
It's mooning üöÄ
Cathie Wood had to take TSLA profits a few days ago

Question for the wise, will DWAC rip or dump AH?
FB running baby. Go go go.

sell spread against my 40k in FB leaps or ride thru Zuck's ride? 

hmm
Yes 300 EOY.
you \*did\* buy $5,120 of TSLA 10/29 1000c at close on Friday and closed today for a profit of $125,760, r-right?
I like them when they were green. In like 2019. Now they just comin with the bammer.
He sure is a GNUS
This is a pretty likely outcome IMO. Never fight the TSLA uppies but I would put my entire worth on Hertz fucking the pooch again.

Lol not really. Traps like that happen all the time before ER. If anything I‚Äôd take this as bearish.
I agree, but that‚Äôs also what I said when it dipped to 70 then shot up to 120
CLOV earnings 11/08

Someone here bought both Tesla puts and Mango calls this morning, I just know it.
It's looking very guh! atm

Don‚Äôt feel bad about profits.
The only Tesla I can afford is a matchbox replica

TSLA at $1600 Friday is a 50K bagger 

The funny part is it will probs hit.

Buying spy calls EOD/selling at open too.
Tesla is genius. Think about the exposure that a rental company would get your whips. Test drive one for a couple days before you buy. Not that they need the exposure but sure an easy way to get more buyers. Hertz gonna have business with people just wanting to test drive them lol.
anyone playing FB earnings? where you leaning?
FB FD‚Äôs I bought 30 minutes ago already up 15%.
No one likes mango anymore
I've been in since 415 PRESPLIT BABY!!!!!!
I mean people coulda bought it at 1045 before it‚Äôs 1:4 split üòÖ and be up 4x

$TSLA is the new safe haven ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Wish I waited a few hours on them. Any ounce of news will move DWAC vigorously
Just because we're talking about TSLA doesn't mean we forgot about you mango bagholders lol
ive made my entire years salary in a week, 10 years a go i was homeless i just dont even know anymore im pretty sure i died somewhere and woke up in a alternate reality.
Im so mad i missed that tesla dip for the last 4 months
Never doubt ü•≠
i‚Äôm just buying shares and holding until more information is published. Would buy calls but idk when  said info will be published and also it‚Äôs very expensive rn
Its hard to tell sometimes because his happy, sad, angry, confused, scared, cucked facial expressions are all the same blank stare.
I like how everyone is freaking out that tesla is up, even though it's been steadily going up for the past 6 months.
Ah. Got it.
I hope TSLA bestie (GOOGL) will be able to ride with the bulls tomorrow
Personally I‚Äôve been dipping for a while
That‚Äôs what I said thirty points ago. But not 460. 460 minus 30 points, ago. Don‚Äôt be like me.
Eat a dick retard
Keep beating him even if he‚Äôs dead

its stupid bad. 330% IV or more etc.

Why do we need a charging network with batteries going 1000 miles?
I called TSLA and im also calling JOBY for being the next stock to go from 10-40$ range to 1000$ range over and over cuz JOBY is like the TSLA Uber of Boeing ok next level type
The U.S. dollar is backed by Tesla

They probably beat, but give hesitant guidance. Who knows what happens tomorrow.
Ok, I'll admit I should have been a little more responsible with the amount of ridiculously OTM calls in my portfolio. Mr. Market is giving me a chance to break back even after a 40% decline. This is just a comment to remind myself that I should have fucking sold today when I look back after the inevitable 100% loss. Hi future me, it's your idiot past self.
I think it'sall ass man
almost 4% gain today is nice too isn't it?

We also have this week‚Äôs earnings, so people likely throwing money at other stocks to play earnings

The truth is somewhere in the middle.

Probably there really are a shitload of counterfeit shares floating about here and there.

Also probably it doesn't matter at all to the markets and the cult theory that **any day noowwwwww** suddenly the retail investors will "win" against the "shorts" is complete bullshit.

Also probably some inaccuracy.

The thesis that there is going to be some huge reckoning suddenly because of retail pressure is totally asinine though.
Seems suspect FB going up eod.  Guess folks are buying for earnings????
FB taking off
FINALLY ZUCK
It should be an achievement to make money on Tesla put

Buying more ü•≠ and mango üö©üî• at 4:10 when it bottoms to sell them again at 8am tomorrow
I thought all the teslas were bought with tsla money
i was looking at my tsla history and i bought 5x 10/29 1000C for 1.42 on 10/21. 710 total. i then paperhanded it and sold it for a loss. that would have been 28k today
Somehow I managed to fuck up one of the greatest bull runs

Never mind, I‚Äôm dumb. I asked this before I saw the news. Wow. I‚Äôm buying more.
When is a good entry point for TSLA?
Fuck FB itll either go sideways or down, get HOOD or SNAP calls
Fb ewwwwwwwwww
Ok. So why 2 trillion?
Super low volume on SPY today.  Market holding its breath to see earnings
They lost the global market to baba, they probably don‚Äôt give a shit anymore since it‚Äôs game over
Their fundamentals are still the same??

Tempting, I'm anticipating destruction but also am often wrong
After his recently deleted tweets relating to Feds inflation caused an oil spill and that he closed all his shorts for a loss on TSLA; I think he is dead.

Sorry to hear that. Sounds like a new gig is in order but in the meantime - dont let your self image get too wrapped up in your job.

I'd say $1300 EOW
SNAP puts are the way to go for FB's earnings report. SNAP loses either way.
they are essentially tesla of helicopters and they completed their flight and battery tests it's like tesla before it skyrocketed
It has to be.
It's had like back to back green months
I would go with puts‚Ä¶

&gt;DEMOCRATIC PROPOSAL TO IMPOSE A METHANE FEE ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCERS NOT LIKELY TO BE INCLUDED IN U.S. RECONCILIATION BILL -SOURCES

Sucker.  The rest of us get that for free.
As outrageous as it sounds, so does a 10% day after a 50% run up to earnings. Who knows.
Ford came with an affordable car when almost nobody had a car. Tesla isn't quite making affordable cars for the working class.

Also history lesson: (source:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\_of\_the\_electric\_vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_electric_vehicle) )

The invention of the first model electric vehicle is attributed to various people.\[7\] In 1828, the Hungarian priest and physicist √Ånyos Jedlik invented an early type of electric motor, and created a small model car powered by his new motor. Between 1832 and 1839, Scottish inventor Robert Anderson also invented a crude electric carriage.\[8\] In 1835, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of Groningen, the Netherlands and his assistant Christopher Becker from Germany also created a small-scale electric car, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells.\[9\]

I just actually paid FB to ram me in the ass
In the daily ARK emails they send out, I'm not OP but I definitely saw them myself.
Look at LUCID MOTORSüòàüòà
He‚Äôs not short anymore
$40 for Plan B or like $50,000-$100,000 in child support. Is this a real question?
Where‚Äôs SPY habibti going tomorrow
At this point this is pure market manipulation for Tesla. I bought $900 11/5 puts on Friday ü•∫
What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs guess on where Tesla ends the week
100% selling 1050 covered calls for 5k/month lol.
TSLA to Nasdaq: I'm the captain now
Lol bro my god
I.mean flow is something
Two things : Elon Musk and AI
Godspeed. Youll need it
Good idea then they will buy 100k more
[deleted]
You're not gonna get rational answers. Everyone's high right now.
Yeah I definitely plan to lower my average if they ever go on the upswing. 

I bought near IPO because I‚Äôm a Columbus native and everyone in the city circle jerks about how great of an employer and company ROOT is. They seemed to be really well positioned and growing a shit load too. But I guess a lot of stuff changed when they went public.
Then we know a stocksplit is coming, thats what he meant lol
The Hookers will be making Bank tonight
Down like the challenger spaceshuttle

Loved watching this place turn on papa Elon over the past 6 months. 

We knew this was coming.
I'm excited
So annoyed I suck at Tesla. I love Tesla. I own a Tesla. But I don't really mess with its stock or options. Why was I born this way
huge comment
Playing ER is really a 50/50. Either buy the right calls or puts. Calls on FB. May the best retard win.
buy 1 LEAP put now, 1 at like $1200 if it gets there
K
Would.it be crazy to buy tsla calls? Yes..yes it would..that's why I'm doing it
Bro this is fucking insanity I missed this so much
Someday, I'll be able to tell my kids that I was an early investor in TSLA when in reality, I just shitposted while playing a stocks game on my phone
Please eow 1300 üëåüëå

$TSLA pls I'm not asking too much, just close at $1069

Close 2nd
Elon on Twitter later today : Tesla‚Äôs stock price is too high IMO
Bummer QCOM bleeding into EOD. Curious to see if it has a last minute pump like last week.
What the fuck is with this euphoria? Weren‚Äôt we just battling inflation fears and shit like that‚Ä¶? God damn the switch makes me doubt everything
Elon has 169 chromosomes
Tried already, would not recommend
Yay these are back
Gourd futures are up 15% I knew I should have invested instead of buying all these bags.
options flow is nothing but TSLA 1050C 10/29 sweeps over and over and over
Soon as those orders come in for Hertz, I‚Äôm going to the lot at 4am and spray painting them all with ‚Äúbankrupt‚Äù. Why can‚Äôt capitalism just let these trash companies die

Edit: you all really like hertz rentals, huh?
Where do all you retards come from thinking ark sold all their Tesla shares‚Ä¶..
Profit taking in to close and we finish 455 on the nose?

If that was true the first day this happened it would never stop happening.

Yep. Up big tomorrow. Flat wed. Down medium thurs. Down small Friday. Finishing around the price it is now.
Yes
Burry messing with her head
TSLA pls end $1050
Like a different pillow or what?
I want to say FB puts but it's already so beaten down and on a resistance level.
Reminder that many boomer funds &amp; systematic strategies buy at EOM ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
:-(
You'd be goated bro
The play was to buy calls on the morning dip and sell before earnings. Then buy back in the next day if it looks like it wants to run.
Daang. This fake and üåàprice movement about to earn me a weeklong ban. I knew i shouldn't have invested in a highly profitable company.
I will never understand TSLAs valuation and therefore I will never be rich. Definitely smart enough not to short it though

uhh noooo, then why i did i -- wait. fuck.
Yup. I bought $1000 calls this morning and I‚Äôm up like $6,000 on them but can‚Äôt sell bc if daytrades‚Ä¶.and I‚Äôm not even worried
Won't surprise me if it opens over 126 tomorrow and breaks that 130 mark
Today is the day i short TSLA.
Bought my tesla stock last week purely off d coin profits, and purely out of impulse/boredom

Thanks Elon :)
I‚Äôm holding my calls for tomorrow unless $1100 hits by EOD‚Ä¶. Doubt it though.
Proof ?
Why do you want him to buy garbage? Are you a garbage man?
Smh they aren‚Äôt letting the homie Tesla blast thru $1,020 again ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You could have made money just buying way way otm TSLA calls
Bought 3 FB $345c 10/29 for $3.58 a piece. Looking at a 2 bagger at minimum AH. Let‚Äôs go suck.
A mix of shares and calls wouldn‚Äôt be retarded. All calls would be an excessive risk.

Let me remind you that Ark still holds Tesla and has to trim their position.

Trap in TSLA for like a minute then brought like 50 shares and sold for a profit. 
I love this shit...
Why do you want to do this
Edit: was talking about the wrong stock

I had a 13c for $572 back in July 2020 that I sold for 50% loss 4 days before expiration thinking it'll expire worthless. Ended up going past that and I would have exercised for 100 shares for sure. Back in 2020 that play was 10% of my portfolio so I know why I did it, but man I wish I hadn't lol. You've got a good entry point, long term they should do great as long as it has Chinas backing but they're dealing with their own economic crap there.
Seriously man. It's such a steal rn
maybe if you're looking at a minute chart.....on the daily chart it hasn't gone below 20 since last march
Uhhh..checks notes... down into the 80s from a high of 121.  Yep.   Thats the sound of retards winning.
Nothing to buy today, was waaaay too hot a day

No you should be selling covered calls on them.

We holding or selling TSLA 10/29 $1000c?

Can ROKU go up 100 in a day too pls?
Oh, hi MARK

AMD needs a good break above 123 then it‚Äôs dicks out time.

AMD puts after earnings? Or SBUX and SNAP calls??
AMD about to break out again
The real question is will they print
Those aren't ATH or ATL. Wait for ATL to sell those. But you shouldn't buy more until at least a 50% increase
And NIO
Fuck it just fomoed back in TSLA 1050 Oct 29
You gotta be absolute retahded to be buying TSLA calls at these prices. So I bought a $900 4dte put for shits and giggles
A lot of you guys aren't considering fundamentals for TSLA. You're the type of guys who speculated Henry Ford, Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Vanderbuilt. Elon literally created the first electric car that FORCED other car companies to do the same.  This same man FORCED Bezos to cry over Gov't contracts in fucking SPACE. I don't know what else to tell you. At this point you deserve to lose money. You're going to be the guy who bought 100 horses on the day Ford came out with their first car.
Too speculative, I‚Äôm already balls deep in speculation.
BALLS OF STEEL ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)

End the day and let's see some FB earnings rocket to the moon/center of the earth
Bruh DWAC is the way
Incredibly risky. Super high iv. Fortunes will be made or lost.
Shit, Let‚Äôs hope 1,100 lol
daaamn that fuckin blows
DWAC isn‚Äôt even the biggest meme stock of the day thanks to Mastercard
Shorts have been absolutely raped
Dr emmet brown
What a moronic statement. Check out the price on puts. Everyone is shorting this and they have only issued 1/5 of the available shares. They have only begun the dump of the pump and dump.
Here I was  ü§° trying to find an entry into SPY all day then pull up the Tesla chart and WHAM cracked a quick $725 in 3 minutes
Bobby B should I buy DWAC
Congratulations to all the Tesla tards.
You sound dumb
Try calls
They fucked over the old bagholders so they could get new bagholders

No I want it to violently go up or down.
bears googling if they can sell their puts in the pre-market
Bought into TSLA at 1017. Worth or naw?
Those 10/29 1200$ calls I bought this morning for 85$ apiece was a 10bagger today ü§ëüôå

Education stocks seem to be fancied on Twitter right now.
yall are getting rich of TSLA while I'm holding PLTR waiting for earnings in November.
MOCHAS ARE AMAZING
Bring those TESLA gains to Donald Trump!
Earnings is a while away, I'll grab some calls closer to it. Right now its just getting pumped thanks to tesla and honestly I'll take it.
we're doing a stock-split and you could then afford calls brother
DWAC such little volatility, SAD!
Watched Donnie Wahlberg say this exact phrase in Band of Brothers yesterday
I flipped a coin and was told to wait to get into Tesla tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

Just my 5 cents.
Went imto the local Gamestop today to do my duties as a partial owner. Checked in on all our people there and made sure their manager was taking good care of them. I helped Jeremy with some restocking he was tasked with and showed solidarity with our guys by taking out the trash. Im thinking about giving Steve a raise.

When is Gordon Johnson going on CNBC to talk about his "bear thesis"? fucking moron
That‚Äôs what people have been saying about Tesla for years. Just because a company has what looks like an insane valuation doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs unjustified.
HERESY! 

:D
Oh god thank you someone is having a worse day than me ‚ù§Ô∏è
Wait it out for now. No sense in FOMO‚Äôing. Wait two weeks and see what happens. If you do get in now, just know that the product is good. The demand will continue to increase and the supply will improve as well. Tesla is good.
Both ü•≠stocks are at a hell of a discount.
How dumb would it be to buy some Tesla 1000 puts right now? I don‚Äôt know shit about options.

Remember seeing someone buying 1000c TSLA asking if they were fucked on Friday, I hope they didn‚Äôt sell
stfu about TSLA already, I missed the boat and now I‚Äôm sad as fuck

When you sell at 150% gains and see the same option as up 1500% later. Damnnnnn
TSLA I need you to go back up , I fomo'd $10M at $1045. I'm down $280k
I‚Äôm up 100% on my TRTN calls right now with ER in the morning.  Sell or let them ride?

Tesla gonna be 1600 by friday just watch
Eventually these over valued stocks like dash and net will crash 80-90% and it‚Äôs gonna be hilarious. Buying a stock at 100 p/s is insane
TSLA will still outshine all of the earnings reports today. Fucking hilarious!!!!
Is tesla doesn‚Äôt go back to 1040 im done for
337, it was 340 all week last week before SNAP earnings.
Too late for Tesla calls?ü§°
Extremely regret not pulling similar calls. I was gonna do 1000c for Oct 29. 100 of them. Yeah.... Good times.
To the CEO of Small Dick Club - Sorry bro, ready to admit you were wrong and move on?

I‚Äôve done it. Pretty straight forward, I think it just took a couple of days to clear.
Congrats retard
I think now that TSLA has ripped past 1,000, there‚Äôs a potential pullback coming within the next few weeks and there, we‚Äôll see it balance out and reach further than its current ATH. People will take their profits and then buy more. It‚Äôs a great product. I like the stock.
my body would be healed if i saw green wat r u saying
Nah.

Keep averaging down.
What? Lol how
The Tesla gains today are gonna be insane!!!!
What if the treasury department is pumping TSLA so they can tax more of Elon‚Äòs unrealized cap gains
The fed will buy the top, keep going

This is safe space you can use the word
gross cooties
A bankrupt WSB Meme stock of old makes a $4 billion dollar order from *the original* WSB Meme stock, causing said stock to catapult up by $120 billion dollar. Proof if ever needed that we are in a simulation, and the Musk is the architect üòé
Lol, wtf. I'm now up 90% on my 1000C Nov 21 T calls. Money. What the fuck is it
Extremely bullish we are going to 465 this week
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Same, got suckered into buying 100 shares @ 6.68. Not a huge loss but I can't believe I fell into the hype.
#Ban Bet Won

Congrats to all you who made a fortune of Tesla today. I‚Äôll just be here with my 5 dollar gain off SNAP

TSLA too low imo
Ah, this reminds me of the heady days of...12 months ago. Back when men were men, and all calls were guaranteed profits.
Holding all week?
on track to beat my banbet bitches
100 bn added to Tsla's market cap on 4b purchase. Whole rental industry is 90 billion. This is madness
That‚Äôs it bro. We moon

Little sell before the pump continues.

Took some gains on the way back down to $1,025. Might buy back in later.
It's only Monday üòÆ
gonna go for weekly calls into FB earnings.
Nothing as per usual. It'll be 170 again by end of the week

It's good to sell the rips and buy the dips.  You get a bigger position each time.  My portfolio is heavily concentrated though.  MP is like 20% of what I own.
Now puts lol
it has to dip before the rip
Tom Brady wrecked the Bears this weekend so Jpow could wreck them today.
What is this January?
Fuck this I always miss Tesla
Imagine if you put down 69k instead of 65$
i shorted at 1020. iv too high for me
FCEL warming up for power hour
After 9 long months of holding and not selling at the summer peak, I finally got out of my NIO 30c for 1/22 at just a 5% loss. Not bad considering I was down 60% 2 weeks ago.
‚ÄúTesla stock price too high imo‚Äù
CYN low Floater
[deleted]
this euphoria is getting pretty insane
If you can't have Brady, go for Mac Jones
remindme! 2 days
Took my pattern day trade on TSLA 1050c from 1015-1036 resulting in 60% of my net worth and over the 25k limit, i guess im not a poor anymore.... well less of one.
Not entirely true. There have been reports of companies dropping ad spending because they don‚Äôt have products in stock. The demand is there but the theory is suppliers will not spend money on advertising if they can‚Äôt ship enough products. 

Search in general has definitely not dropped but if there are less companies bidding for the ads then the price of ads is most likely gonna be lower. We‚Äôll see though. Fb reports today which will give good indication.
TSLA defiled me today.
Someone give me retard of the year award
Imagine being bearish on a bchain decentralized platform, endless supporters, and web 3.0 catalyst because muh FUD
Got my ten bagger. Thanks elon! I'm taking the rest of the year off work.
I‚Äôm gonna look real artistic when I get banned and my banbet shows up at the top later.
Sold tsla calls for a loss this morning. Bought back in at 1040 üòãüòãüòãüòã
Jesus. whoever got in at the top of this short lived pump RIP.
 I hope so. I got in late on calls. I was up $2500 now in up $400 lol. Hopefully holding for tomorrow will pay off or suck.

after todays madness, what kind of magic can power hour bring?
TSLA is trying to put SPY on its back to cross that 446 line. If only any other top SPY holdings could not drool on themselves rn
XPEV already up 11%
AMKR earnings a good play?
You are very wrong.  It can go up to 50% just a simple google search would tell you that.
Classic Tesla fib extension pullback
Was it a **Down‚Äôs Syndrome payment?**

Done for this month. Closed everything else apart from UPS puts and AMC calls. Don't mind even if they expire worthless. Already made enough profit for a month
WSB is making so much money today.

This is a historical moment for WSB. Glad we are sharing it together
Nothing atm

Just yoloed into 10/27 159c
this is the way. same. I see this pump continuing.
Seems hard .  Paid $41 in March and sat on bags forever
below 1k at the end of the day would be the meme move
already profiting. RIP
I can‚Äôt actually believe what TSLA has done in a week
Tesla had an allergic reaction to 1040 apparently
If they're trading stocks and on TikTok, that's a problem.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECvQUeNhBBk
Papa, new split so we can buy more please
Don‚Äôt know why but I love Tesla but hate TSLA
My average is $129, might just sell an ITM call expiring next week and call it a day.
Come on consolidate a bit so I can get back in !!!!
Ugh why did I sell 50 tsla shares last month to help fund a down payment
Should‚Äôve got into TSLA damn üòÜ
so.. when puts?

I thank God every night for making me a bull and tesla fucking ripping through the market
Uh guys. What‚Äôs GameStop doing?
b-b-b-buy the dip?
I have been buying around 31, loading up below 28, trimming at 35.  This has been very successful for me.  No bags if you follow this.
Almost exactly this time last year TSLA started an incredible run up to previous ATH in December into Janruary. You know who followed their charts almost to the t and made me my first 10bagger? XPEV, NIO. I‚Äôm keeping an eye on our Chinese rip offs.
Consolidation before a massive EOD pump
You mean AMZN. Hasn‚Äôt even beat inflation rate in 1 year. Companies a joke this year.

Autism. Autism everywhere.
When you have megacap stocks swinging by percentage points of 10% or more (SNAP, TESLA, Intel)
I read somewhere that advertising is a replacement play - you want people to buy your product over the competition's. So supply chain issues or no, you need to advertise to get the revenue, even if it's a seller's market.
Now is the time to join the mango frenzie. We have public hedge-fund shorts that are about to be the next citadel
I just hope they believe in FB as much as people believes in TSLA today. I could use a 10% gain for my long calls
Guh I got FDs at the top lol
FOMO is the mind killer
Instead of being down 23% on my PayPal calls I could of made bank on Tesla

This has nothing to do with Hertz IMO. It was just an unexpected catalist that got the ball rolling causing shorts to cover.

Dont u do it!!!
If you need to you can sell a call one strike above 1100 for the same exp date and you're gains are essentially locked without a daytrade. Just sell both tomorrow morning
Imagine if Burry lied about closing his short position...

Dumped all my TSLA for SoFi last week, I still believe in Elon but thought SoFi had a better chance of memeing.
Tesla over 1T
I will suck cathie‚Äôs fart and pay her in tsla stocks to do so.
Idk anymore. I think all the money went to TSLA for the day haha
Gotta be. Think of how much people been using FB the last few months

Puts
Elon for prez
One more
So many people are quitting wow and wow classic. I don‚Äôt know about their other games. CoD is honky ass trash lol

Probably won‚Äôt show up in earnings for a little while. I also heard that they might make some spin off companies or change their name in light of the sexual harassment bullshit?

I hate the company with a vengeance tho. I‚Äôm very biased.
I bought puts so I‚Äôm prob fucked
What an idiot. Fuck Brady im takin that ball home.
I‚Äôm raising my EOD price target from 1025 to 1050
Yuppies love all birds, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll buy in for the IPO
Bought 1250c as a joke. They nearly up 100% like whaaa????
cause its a validation news+0 bulls expected this this fast, using one of the most loved celebrities of the right which is the group that hates tesla the most is smart, but even so its overblow
Do the pump Amazon.
I am a god. Next up ZIM!
From Feb to Oct this year most of you didn't believe in Elon and didn't want to touch tsla. Now that's it's at an ath you all start shouting about it lol
Is this sub poor? How come I don't see alot of 7-8 digits TSLA gain porn here? I saw one that was 2M from a 450k investment. TSLA stock is up 250x since IPO dood , where's the fucking 8 digits gain porn? Instead I see a 2k gain porn from TSLA shares wtf is this trash
Bought 1050 weeklies an hour ago. Up 100%
Got my first 10 bagger day
Just because I failed to buy calls at open doesn't mean puts are the answer
I did that 30 minutes ago
No, your little clown emoji is the salty part.
&gt;U.S. STOCKS EXTEND GAINS, NASDAQ UP 1.00 PCT

Tesla adding $100b but Sofi can‚Äôt fukin add $1b I hate the stock market
RIP
Bet you bought puts based on him being short it.  The salt is real.
Expecting a few more TSLA PT upgrades ASAP
That would ofc depend on the strike and expiry which isn't mentioned
Damn, fair enough autist

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
I couldn‚Äôt do it. I couldn‚Äôt not play FB earnings. Impossible task.
TSLA is pretty much worth more than every other automaker combined at this point

dont try to make sense of it, just another day in the casino
I‚Äôm finally even all time right now and I told myself once I reach this point I‚Äôm selling everything and getting as far away as possible from the stock market. Peace out y‚Äôall it‚Äôs been real
I kick myself more and more everyday for selling tesla in early 2020
How much were Tesla 1000 calls October 1st? 

Just wanna cry about it
it's probably not a bad time to load up on BA. it routinely hits $210-$212 then pops to $220

MARKET ROTATION INTO TESLA.
Need 1% on the Nasdaq today otherwise I declare bankruptcy
TLRY wants to break out baby!!!
God, the FOMO I‚Äôm feeling for Tesla is at epic levels. Anyone think it‚Äôs worth buying 1100 weeklies, or am I throwing money down the drain at this point?
Fuck you all. Tesla going mars
It's broken out, there's really no telling where it stops now, but they raised price targets on it to the 1200's so that's where I put my call price target at.
Honk‚Ä¶Honk‚Ä¶Honk you are going to have to excuse my clown shoes that I‚Äôm wearing. They honk every time I take a step. Honk‚Ä¶Honk‚Ä¶Honk. Sold my calls at the bell‚Ä¶wonderful‚Ä¶Honk‚Ä¶Honk

Yay?
Free money on TSLA calls
Bought Tesla calls for 5.10, sold for 3.85, now at 9.05 ü§°
the fan traded back Brady's 600th TD ball for $1,000 in team store credit and an auctioneer has now estimated the ball to be worth $500k at least lmfao

worst trade deal in the history of trade deals
Why DWAC why......
Below 70 and it will slow burn to 10, only thing keeping it up is momentum and hype.
A new generation of bag holders were minted into creation today!
Elong gonna do a cock split?

Tsla added 100 b to it‚Äôs market cap today I genuinely don‚Äôt understand. Sold 970c for a loss this morning ü§°
All meme stock holders. GTFO... and rotate to TSLA. Now.
Bears in shambles. At this point they would sell America to the cylons if it meant their puts printed
Today.  But Tsla is a fickle bitch.

TSLA won‚Äôt stop until it passes AAPL in market cap.
come on man it was a pump bro - you seriously think their shitty open sourced social platform is going to be worth a damn? no
sold my tesla call earlier for over 100% profit, if i'd held I'd be at 340% profit. fomo'd back in and already up 42%

10/29 TSLA $1,500C only like $60. Bought 1
even at the highest marginal tax rate in the highest taxed province, it's just 25% on capital gains tax
So after that 1k threshold and 1 trillion mkt cap? 

Is Tesla really about to go to 1500?

Tesla bull and owner here just this is crazy
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
the problem with the DWAC slow bleed is that they aint gonna halt shit like that
I bought some 1100C an hour ago and that shit‚Äôs printing hard.

buy them close to the money
Important: TSLA will split before Elon has to exercise his options Q4. He'll borrow against the stock to pay his taxes, split the stock... and viola - it goes to Mars
People rly thought Tesla would stop at 1000üòÇüòÇüòÇ
DWAC options turned severely bearish in the afternoon. Totally faked me out. I can't see this not getting pumped up again though.
Straddle on Tesla
NIO following TSLA
Don't mess this up Elon. You cost me a lot of money with that 1 tweet last year.

Fuck it, next time im holding through earnings. Lookin at you NVDA and TSLA...fml

God Bless them. They're the ones that make it absolutely RIPPPP like this.

Huh? Haven't been active here for ages

I'm too scared to go any more into Tesla. What else is the play
Wind turbines have been blamed for a variety of physical maladies. Simon Chapman, a professor emeritus of public health at the University of Sydney, compiled a list  
 of 247 ailments and disturbances, ranging from sleeplessness and   
depression to cancer and even death, that people have attributed to wind  
 turbines over the years.
BITCH WT-A-FFFFFFFFFFFFF?!?!?!
What‚Äôs tax free? I took out some money from the 401k to pay off some credit cards and it got taxed.
oh god on no, my fingers want to yolo ü•≠
Yet you brought him up, must wonder what his cock length is???
Just buy out Boeing and make electric airplane with all the gains today.
I'll be next lol, have a couple more weeks
Snapchat to the moon bois dropped 30% time to put in the life savings
I walk away for 5 fucking minutes and Tesla keeps exploding.
My 1/22/22 $1100 call I bought last week is absolutely sending. Thanks Papa Elon üöÄ
Tesla going to 1100$ this week?
Tesla is going to be a monopoly. So far what it seems it just burns investor cash to monopolize multiple industries, just like amazon. Other companies refuse to invest in anything other than share buybacks so this is how things are.
I got you all with the counter upvote frenzy
It‚Äôs insane thanks Elon ü§ëü•∫
All my spy 459 call holders. When we selling ? I got till Wednesday
Should I get out of ATVI  $81c fri exp now? Down 10% already
&gt; You can sell them now and get trade restrictions.
I sold mine last week for a 10% gain. Would be 20 baggers if I had held them through now. Pain.
Everyone here is retarded, you‚Äôre not special.
How does FB usually do on earnings?
MARK was up 900%, now it's up 30%.
Bubbles
Somedays you are just on the wrong side of the pump and dump. Time to move those shares of $MARK into some bags and place them in the attic.
hmm, wen tsla puts? Must be soon right?
Tesla up 10% in a day is reminiscent of summer 2020. Amazing times and amazing gains

Enjoy it guys
Fuck that. Tesla for TSLA gang
$tsla $2k next
Bought 9 1100c this morning for two ish dollars. Do I sell them today and get trade restrictions or wait till tomorrow??
ha, sure.
Rip my tsla puts
yeah but TSLA is expected to out preform ford in .... 2040
Yeah wish I kept my 10/29 $1000 call longer but hey can't complain about profit
I need the market to stay like this forever.
Can PYPL just go up please
Downvoters out? Lemme guess you bought mango over $100?

ooook oook

not crying just observing the obvious never traded tesla in any way
will not FOMO into 1150 weeklies. FML it'll hit that anyway.
The future. Tesla is gonna be the new cord.
Personally I could care less about what anyone thinks on this sub.
Funny to see the daq up so much when AMZN MSFT and Google are all red
Money!
My puts are already up from it dropping on snaps earnings. Also the exact same thing was said to me last week when I was loading up on snap puts &amp; I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware how that turned out. Nobody said I was confident since it‚Äôs earnings and nobody knows but I‚Äôm confident enough that I  don‚Äôt feel the need to call random people retard who bought calls.
I'm tempted to sell some of it and let the others ride. But fuck, its $5000 pre split right now. That's insane.

EDIT: sold a little under half of my shares. Guarantees a 150% return.

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
so the move is to buy when Cathie sells lol
You know, every time you‚Äôve bought calls and talked about them in here the last few weeks, they would have printed every time I believe if you had just bought ATM or only slightly OTM instead of like 6-10 strikes away
Yes son i‚Äôm back from buying cigars.
SKLZ, I suggest hopping in while its still held down a bit, right before the major FOMO kicks in.  Could just be a couple shares

This is not financial advise, im just another retard on the interwebs
I have tried to short Tesla cause of it's fundamentals and obvious overvaluation, but it's not worth the risk with the cult like following that is driving the price up. Doesn't matter how shitty the revenue is compared to the marketcap as long as people continue to like Tesla and Elon it will just keep going up
Bought into CRSR a month ago. Getting killed
I did the same thing last week but not with Tesla, hugs. It sucks when you're wrong about being wrong and then its just all wrong.
Someone who either had tsla puts or sold covered calls and is about to lose their shares
Today alone, Tesla went up three Ford‚Äôs in market cap. Ford has three times the revenue of Tesla. Fucking crazy land.
Tsla has added almost TWO Ford‚Äôs to its market cap today. Lol.
Time to buy calls on tesla

Ride the rip!!!
Probably gamma rap. Those calls need to be hedged by the end of the week lol
Lmfao shorts must be shitting their pants. TESLA ISNT SUPPOSED TO MAKE MONEY!!! Still Beats earnings when automotives ballooned in price. ü§≠
Well said. Watching it last 2 years daily its true.

&gt;it's called not being retarded

Welp only made 25% off tsla 1000c instead of 600% if I had bought in the morning when I was looking at them ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Tesla is overvalued af. Period. If you make money on it, congrats. But be careful.
LOL $TSLA ghey bers are out downvoting again, they really hoped it would crash once it touches $1000 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
FB was at 340 last week and fell because of what SNaP reported. They‚Äôre going to show they‚Äôre not in the same boat, announcing a name change, and beating reports. Confidence doesn‚Äôt mean a run up. People are afraid. That‚Äôs when you make money. Idk why you‚Äôre still arguing with me.
well im upvoting everything then
Yes. It is magnificent and very interesting to follow.
Ah, this is the TSLA I know and love.
Bought calls at the 945 dip sold at 949 bc im going for 10% a day

Havent lost money in 7 days but i feel fucking empty
Lol tlry is literally the worst stock of all time
Fuck it. TSLA dragging my NIO position uppies. Go Elonzi!

People trying to make ‚Äúsense‚Äù out of TSLA have only seen it go parabolic once, not the other 15 times‚Ä¶.

After years of doubt wall street and the banks finally caved in to Tesla 

Good shit Elon
TSLA is WILDLY undervalued. 1300-1400 by eoy
You can't even make the joke the first thousand is free do it again. This is $5000 pre split.

Glad we were all together when they made history.
Sorry to the bag holders

Tesla isn't going to the moon. It is the moon.
My 1010C 12/17/21 ITM holy fuck, I was actually -60% just a few weeks ago.
An individual should be provided the exact same day-trading rules regardless of capital. Having under $25,000 should not lead a retail investor to have to wait for their money to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù prior to making their next trade.

its fucking insane how overvalued tesla is
Thoughts on BIRD IPO? Could be another meme I guess
Everyone‚Äôs really trying to make Tesla a 1T company today cause some company that almost bankrupted order 100k cars that‚Äôll cost no more than $10 billion over several years. How does one $10 billion sale justify a $100 billion increase in market cap today?? I thought Tesla‚Äôs growth is already priced in?? Why does expected news keep causing the stock to propel upward? For comparison that increase in market cap is more than Ford is worth as a company. Ford had over $100 billion in revenue last year. Yes their revenue has been decreasing but still
Stay salty.
imagine missing this whole tesla run
I was going to fomo into Tesla options but figured I‚Äôd do the opposite since I‚Äôm always wrong. Well I was wrong about being wrong.

99% of time you should buy 0DTE TSLA calls on Friday , but looks like it's time to buy 0DTE puts this week for a potential 100x bagger.
Officially convinced selling my Tesla shares before the split was not the best decision
Sold mine for a 50% lol could be 100% by now

That's true too
Great guy
So I checked out some of the forums where trump supporters congregate and none of them are buying DWAC. They think it is some liberal coastie wallstreet trick, or they are veterans who have been burned before in the stock market. I think it is only WSB that holds DWAC in anticipation of the trump wave that is not coming!

I know the housing market hasn't been this hot in decades but this has got to be unsustainable. When everyone with a pulse is able to buy regardless of if they should, you can't get evicted, a lot of younger people haven't had student loan payments since early 2019, the average citizen spending 35% soon to be 40% of their gross income on housing (not including living expenses like food to eat and gas to get to work which is also up about 30%) it looks like - no pun intended - a house of cards. It looks like most middle class Americans are overleveraged and all they need is a little push to get evicted in February.

Good shit then the comment has nothing to do with you. I‚Äôm sure you see every other comment in here now talking about gay bears and how fucked they are. Those are the same people who when the market dumps are on here crying looking for sympathy while their mascara drips down their face.

I‚Äôm even on it as of today again. Been up a grand when it was over 2 bucks. Really don‚Äôt have any attachment to it. Thought it might break out when they signed Shaq on because usually his business ventures actually make money.

I mean this morning they were hyped because a completely different stock with the same symbol on the German exchange was at $20. That's the level of education we're dealing with.
GNUS bagholders are quite ridiculous. Like the guy who said he streamed their stuff 24/7 on multiple devices and said everyone should do it! "Be the change!" - holy shit how desperate. The stocktwats feed is just pathetic.

Why did I sell my tsla calls almost right after open and am I gay
SOFI needs to hit 22.5 before earnings so I can party with some buck naked hoes.
The amount of people subbed to WSB not increasing in any meaningful way since last week would indicate to me that DWAC apes have been among us all along
BENEheads already talmbout "have patience," and "scared money don't make money" that's early bagholder territory. They're not confident in it.
Ok whatever. I was wrong. I am happy for everyone who was right. I‚Äôve almost wiped out my +50k for the year (in 3 weeks). Time to start de-levering.
Tsla is the OG pandemic meme stock. Peoples just forgot it was a meme and they got so much money from dillutions that maybe its not a meme anymore.

I'm a retard and I don't really understand options (case in point, last week I bought several decently OTM options that expire this week), but I'm playing with relatively small amounts and not YOLOing anything.  So I probably don't belong here?

My point was more the extremely low float on a company that is real with real revenue rather than some of these no name no revenue companies promoted on here. It deserves a higher valuation regardless, but a retired doctor has enough money in the bank to purchase the entire float today if they wanted to.
This is free market capitalism.

It's story is very similar to PLTR. Its been stuck in a channel going back to January 2019, trading between 9.76 and 14.70. If you are expecting anything from it, I think you'll be disappointed. Might be worth playing some covered calls, but otherwise, there are better stocks to be focusing on.

What's the most odd to me is the rally going into what I previously thought were significant earnings in regards to headwinds some companies are facing.
i mean that implies that the tesla cars won't catch on fire in the middle of a highway or keep crashing into pillars/barriers/pedestrians on autopilot

Might go long on Hertz‚Ä¶ all the Elon, Tesla Fan boys will exclusively go to Tesla. All the people who can‚Äôt afford a Tesla or are on the fence about buying a Tesla‚Äî will rent it for a day from hertz. Bullish as fuck for HERTZ

Oh my DIS can you get pass $180 end of week LOL
I am in the same predicament
I'm not worried, I only had a little bit of cash balance in my account left for this play so I'm only down like 150$.  Since I was at work, I could only pay so much attention to my trades it and usually stop orders work in my favour, but when a stock gains/loses 30% in minutes stop orders can fuck you up.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, whomever posted that YOLO you linked took it down lol.
Totally - can‚Äôt go broke taking profit, you have the right idea
Doing $ZNGA instead. I see more growth potential and they treat women well. atvi facing lawsuits.
Imagine sitting around waiting for mango stock to do something when you could have just bought spy calls at open and tripled your money.

Did you read up on it? They partnered with GE in April.
I‚Äôve made so much damn money on Costco in the last week and it‚Äôs just continuing to rip.
It must be hard for shitty boomer auto companies who are still slaves to the oil barons to know the Tesla is going to be the end of all of them and there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it.  No paid FUD articles or paid CNBC FUD can stop Tesla from taking North America. Tesla‚Äôs only real competitors will be NIO who will dominate Asia and Volkswagen who was smart enough to innovate in time and will compete with them in Europe. It‚Äôs over for Ford and other boomer autos, they should have innovated when they knew it was the right thing to do, they arrogantly believed they could keep milking the gas guzzling to the last second. Their cars have always been shit anyways I would never buy anything from Ford or GM. I‚Äôll be buying Tesla, NIO, and VW/Audi only. Rest in piss nature killing boomer auto
Always inverse Cathie. She buys it dumps, she sells it moons
Just got back from a trip and I've never seen the airport and airlines so busy.  $UAL + $DAL are gonna kill it from here on out.
Great documentary about the Fed. ‚ÄúThe power of the Fed.‚Äù  Free on YouTube and it‚Äôs from Frontline on PBS.
so mid and small caps get double fucked lol
are some of you holding AMD calls through earnings?
They are just hedging 7million in calls.
Somebody turn off MSFT and turn it back on again.
Bro, hertz already has like $9 bil In debt.

They‚Äôre going to finance for another $4 bil on top of that?

Intel FDs are insanely cheap for near the money calls. With AMD earnings tomorrow, plus the drop off the cliff last week.. I feel like that could make it go up a few dollars. And just $3 could make that a 10 bagger on the low end.

that was burry's thesis all along, that they would do a massive cap raise and drop the stock by 30%

TSLA and capitulation name a better duo
What time is margin call for accounts? 2pm or 3pm? Asking for $TSLA shorts

Watching Elon with the machine, it was suddenly so clear. The Tesla would never stop. It would never leave him. It would never hurt him, never shout at him, or get drunk and hit him, or say it was too busy to spend time with him. It would always be there. And it would die to protect him. Of all the would-be electric vehicles who came and went over the years, this thing, this machine was the only one who measured up. In an insane world, it was the sanest choice.
while i agree spotify is overrated, downloading from youtube is shit quality

Sure, +10% on TSLA in a single day. Totally normal market.
Wait what does Gordan have to do with any of this lol
They have tons of money.
in either case you're fuk bro
Well, given the fact that Tesla has now got a year wait to buy a new car, and the fact that Hertz agreeing to buy that many vehicles means the floodgates are going to open and other fleet owners will be jumping iI, it wouldn't surprise me to see companies like Avis and Entrrprise also submitting orders soon

Am I doing it right????? ü•≤
MONEY IS LITERALLY FAKE
So true. I had a few other good plays in the last few months with calls and I've been holding that cash to buy something. Problem is I never bought anything and now I'm just holding a lot of cash. I had the opportunity to be buying more Tesla stock when it was $700 like a month ago but I waited for it to go even lower and obviously we all know how that's turned out now. My position is so small and Tesla currently that if I actually sold it would be mainly to lock in some profits and even if there was a smaller pullback I would just buy those back to lower my cost basis. I'm doing this in a tfsa account so there is no tax implications which is why I would even consider doing it.
There is no more "bers r fuk", there's just simply isnt anymore more bers to be fuk
God damnit SOFI break through 21 and go straight to the fucking moon!!!!!!!!!
TSLA should do an equity offering rn and use that cash solely for future R&amp;D.
Tmr at this hour u will say yesterday was a classic bull trap

Get in the puts party now 

Play both sides to win

Adios

Enjoy your last few hours my üåà friend
I called the bottom for FB. If the negative articles for any stock start to read like exerpts from an angsty teens diary with hyperlinks every sentence you know the bottom is in.
I should call her‚Ä¶.Kathy Wood plz answer
By not selling TSLA now, doesn't that mean I'm buying the top?
TSLA $910 puts 10/29 locked and loaded, they went from $2,500 a pop to $260 in 1 day, only risk what your willing to lose
You going in again?
Also amazing that a fleet sale is seen as good news.

Any other company and this is seen as dumping surplus
Is Michael bury even alive anymore. He has to have had all of his 2008 gains wiped out.
Thanks. This is what I needed. 
Not selling let's go!
Sell TSLA or ride this bitch to MARS?

I just woke up. What‚Äôs the reason for this rally?

I am not sure about the details. I just know they are not making their code open source, and they can't have the company run while that is the case. Well they can, but they will be sued for it.

But yeah, It most likely only has a legal recourse once they launch the product.
So spy to 460 or not because my 459 calls already up 300%

thanks for making me feel better GrundleMonster
Yeah, but the loss porn will be epic
Spy to 460
Once you stop trying to sell the top you‚Äôll feel better about yourself. Also selling something to get back in is harder to do than it looks. Only sell if you have something better to do with the money (which can include cash)
I tried that once. Didn‚Äôt work out great. What are you picking up?
iirc Tesla has less than 5% short float, so no

When I woke up this morning I looked at DWAC options. Everything was like 2,000$ for the contracts. I literally saw one contract for 400$ and didn‚Äôt buy it. Checked it a minute later and it was worth 2,400$.

Teslas movement this last week has reminded me of last years pump. It‚Äôs not heavily shorted either so this bitch could go higher, announce a split, and do it all again.
Holy fuck how did you only make 50% today fucking loser
I believe in price to sales ratios.

Compliance denied me 2 weeks ago from buying a 10/29 900 call for 300 bucks.. really annoyed now
I didn‚Äôt say I wanted to make money
Do you seriously think no one has made money on Tesla puts in the last 5 years? God damn this place is becoming as regarded as it was during GME
[deleted]
My only regret is that I didn‚Äôt buy more TSLA calls
How do I take back my banbet?
How do we like Calendar spreads for these Mango Meme stocks?

Assume they‚Äôve got some staying power for a few weeks, sell a Nov put and buy the same strike December Put. You lose about half the difference in price between them if the stock plummets before you exit.

Picked up a 1250 November 26 Call. New Price targets coming in, this bitch is like 2020 all over again.
You park your money in a blue chip and blow yourself for being boring.
Congrats, now you get to lose it on something else
NOT A CHANCE
I need the fed to taper EFX stonk in particular
Really needed the win I got today. Bought Nov. 1 455 calls when we were at 453.30 or so and sold them for a 50% gain a few minutes ago. Wish I‚Äôd gone in heavier, only made a couple hundred, but god damn it‚Äôs nice to have a winning trade. I did nothing but lose last week, it was death by a thousand stop loss triggers
Get your fiber in first.

You really think so, that $1000 is just getting started?

It's true it's not even at a trillion cap yet and apple's at two. 

There's also a possibility of another stock split I guess.
Cut to Michael Burry looking like the screaming pink wojack
Bought CHPT cuz I missed TSLA
DCA into LEAP puts
Sold for a K earlier today, bought 1100 for 250, jumped to 450 and now fading. Gonna let it ride, already profited 700 per option.
I need more pump
I got 330 calls expecting it to do that.
&gt; We have learned that Elon Musk is very good at making up stories.
Cathie Wood has a crush on Elon.
Sold wish bags, mvis bags at a lose today and then took the money and got tesla calls for eow.

I may lose all this passive income this week. Woot
How the hell has tsla ran up so much üòÇ. Man i missed out
I'd sell right now

options probably. time-limited. if you make dumb picks margin can kill you too
Up $27k. Just shares. If only I dropped more into options at open smh
Word never again tried twice and got fucked both times , meanwhile I‚Äôm up 6% today being a dumbass and not playing it safe
Just saw someone say ‚Äúif you didn‚Äôt make money today you‚Äôre retarded‚Äù 

I guess that makes me retarded.
With this level of fomo we ain‚Äôt seeing below $990 anytime soon lol
In terms of market cap, above TSLA is AMZN. Only makes sense that TSLA will be worth more than AMZN.
Honestly thinking of yoloing tsla weekly here
time for a rug pull
Three way between you, Jim Cramer, and Cathie Wood. How could you say no?
cash out dude, that‚Äôs gotta be like over a 10-bagger by now. enjoy the gains, lock them in then focus on another good play

this is always a good sign right?
Tesla calls printing. I don‚Äôt own any but I imagine they are printing.
Why not both?
What do I buy today if I don‚Äôt trade options like a degenerate gambler? Am bored
Easy mode will be confirmed if all EVs run just because of Tesla like the old days ü•≤
Got destroyed on JMIA Friday but now we back in business‚Ä¶
Trade options on margin.

If you‚Äôre thinking of shorting the market just don‚Äôt. Shit will theta it out for weeks at the top before it will let your puts print in a spectacular crash
if you can stomach the swings. This is only the beginning.
Tesla is what every other meme aspires to be.
Margin or options trading? Which one is more dangerous??

Don't know except the market is gey
Imagine if you had done that with 80k
Got 1 1kc tesla call last week for 133$ makin some good profit on it. It expires Friday. Gonna wait till it hits 1k then sell or do I ride it out a few days and see if it goes higher. Conventional wisdom says cash out because every other time I've let things ride it ends up crashing and I lose it all.
Wen TSLA split ??
"It was just a trade" - ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)

Yes a really shitty one. One of us one of us.
Name a bigger sell wall than TSLA 1000.  I'll wait.
I bought calls on UVXY earlier. So of course it drops.
TSLA - escort night

AMC - ramen night

DWAC - dumpster diving

PHUN - gas station job

Theta - club night
Premium and IV are insanely pricey on options for it right now.
TSLA was at 997 and then of course the üåàüß∏ starts talking about it go figure
Corn profits?
Solid bet

Cuz we all get Tesla FDs rn
Wait for a dip and yolo on January calls?
I don‚Äôt have the balls to short TSLA so SPY puts it is.  WTF is all this $ coming from?
Dude commercialized electric vehicles and space travel. People still doubt, and hate. Lmfao.

Yea, and?
Theta
This market is *stupid*-stupid
Try not being a creep
Yup.
The first. So 10 bagger simply means +900% ROI. Although it‚Äôs so close it‚Äôs kinda interchangeably used
I love to see people shorting TSLA especially in the current context. This just means double the buys once TSLA clears $1000
Lol another person who believes it‚Äôs just a car company
Loading up on my Wednesday SPY FDs. What we thinking, 457 or 458?
Who's on that MRO grind?
You made money.
83k sell wall at $1,000 for Tesla. That‚Äôs a cool 83 mil worth
Ugh my new job has lots of girls at it.  How do u hide ur boner all day?
shut the fuck up you piece of shit i wanna load up later
Trillion dollar market cap with less than 42 billion in revenue. What a time to be alive.
That could mean you turned 1k into $1001.

Elon is now worth a cool 273 billion. Fuck you bezos.
I bought Tesla puts this morning. How retarded am I
I‚Äôm so euphoric right now ü§§
Buying Tesla dips üòã
TSLA pullback to 980 and then EOD rip up to $1000
What's up, BROS?
nice to see my LCID going up too
Does a 10 bagger mean the stock is 10x what you bought it at, or that you have gained 1000%? Meaning if you buy in at $10/share, does it become a 10 bagger at 100 or 110?
Someone is getting fired today for being underweight on Tesla across all the boomer funds.
Its supposed to be $4000 post split
Time to delta-gamma hedge
Everyone says this like he didn‚Äôt close his short position. Dude probably made a killing.
Sold my spy calls exp Wednesday. Don‚Äôt want to lose my money again. Would suck if it keeps pumping
I literally have no idea what to expect for earnings right now. What's with all the optimism?
Fuck yeah! Fidelity now has IEX routing for better price executions! Citadel is fucked.

Ask those here who shorted it. Oh wait, they can't answer you, they got Burried.

That‚Äôs never backfired before
UGH sold my SPY calls way too early. Pussy hands.
Your buying opportunity on TSLA is anytime before it clears $1000
he did, people just need to think they are smarter than him.
Same I bought a 900 tesla call in the 21st thinking it was risky lol
Ever since I went thetagang I went from -43% to -42.5% in 6 months!
Got one - I figure it crashes even with good ER

buy calls at a high strike price, then just sell when it goes up
Guys think about it. Hertz is buying 100k tesla vehicles. That's already 6 billion in sales. If you're not in tesla now you're fucking your future self over
‚ÄúI said I would not harm the bears, and I shall not. But Tesla is Tesla and the market takes the weak. My market, my Tesla, my dune‚Äù-Baron Elon Muskrat.   *queue ominous music*

100k cars is couple billion of sales for tsla. But since it trades 20X sales, add 100 billion or so to its market cap. a million per car that they sell for 50k. What a wonderfull business.
5k worth of gambling money. Only bad suggestions üëá

Not the worst decision from this sub

Been losing money on Tesla for a year after I made 50k off it last year. Now look at it. So crazy.
If you aren‚Äôt making money today this is where you belongggg!
TSLA god status
So let me get this straight

Hertz buys 100k cars from Tesla,

Tesla's valuation skyrockets over $100B

In other words, selling one car increases Tesla's valuation by over $1M

Yeah, that makes sense
There is no way tesla can hit 1200 by the eow... or am i being irrational
wow there's no stopping TSLA
Yes but the time to do that was this morning

Mmm classic IV crush play. You hate money?

The only thing that matters now days is the color of your skin. If you white, you aint right.
SNAP is not a mega tech... If you like how TSLA rocket after smashing earnings, watch FAAMG this week

I think buying SAM calls is the dumbest trade I have ever made. Getting absolutely diddled rn
AMD! AMD! AMD!
Finding them before that announcement is the trick. After it has been announced, the uplist will be priced in really fast. The penny stock subreddit anounces when it happens.
Sold all my pins calls last week. Pins has my permission to die. With my luck though it will be at 100 by eom

I'm an ASTS holder and I disagree
Most people don't want to own the unleveraged stock, or don't have money to cover the assignment. Most options strategies are about short term thesis, not tying your money up in 100s of k of a single stock.

Said the other way, if you want to own the stock why buy an option? You're adding theta and IV risk to your thesis.
At least do covered calls

Okay word. Any bears left?
960x2, 990, 1000 fds, and 1150 for next weed
Its wild, TSLA is solely saving Tech today.
150 is too OTM and thus your premium is too sensitive to the time-value (it is actually \*\*only time-value\*\*, which itself is directly derived from the IV). So yes, an IV crush will hurt those badly. It's your call but if I were you I'd switch to ITM calls for earnings and then once IVs get crushed I'd get back into the OTM ones.

Even the ones that DON'T think it'll moon and become the biggest ticker of all time are still buying a few to "send a message" to the deep state and mainstream media. 

I'm the furthest thing from a Trump supporter, but I'm gambling on them driving the price up to $300 before the end of the week. Got in at 18.45, averaged up to $23-ish, now I'm just sitting pretty and waiting for the next jump.
I‚Äôm not too happy that people seem to have lost the rush feeling.

Greatest bull trap of all time

what ya sittin on?
Sorry I don't mean to insult you, but I may be misunderstanding your question. Each contract is for 100 shares of the underlying security. so if you execute those contracts you're paying 30 x $128 = $3840 for the right to buy 3000 shares of Spy at $455 = $1,365,000 which you would then turn around and sell for whatever the price currently is.

Not exactly. Just a dummy.
Just found out there's a 1 hour chart on robinhood. It's also red though
Logic doesn't always translate to share price, but it's just so obvious the kind of revenue boost they're likely to see now that everybody in this country trades stocks. Basically doubles your per user revenue on an enormous segment of the population that previously didn't need the premium version for cap gains (not to mention people buying into audit protection because they're worried about bungling it).

"First let's determine why bears think it is.  
  
They only sell electric cars. Not even a lot. No profit.  
  
They're running on gov't tax credits.  
  
Amazon does everything. Doesn't even compare.  
  
So here's why you're losing money.  
  
This is Elon stock. Not EV car stock. Spacex, SolarCity, Hyperloop, and OpenAI.  
  
Gov't tax credits is a reliable source of off setting liabilities. Let's be rational, enviormental positive outcomes always comes out profitable.  
  
Amazon is only AWS. Realistically they are a logistics and data company. They do not produce any physical products but capitalizing only internet usage.  
  
Some other points  
  
Space Mining  
  
Spacex vs Blue Orbit  
  
Combining autonomous driving with uber to create financed transportation and decreasing inefficiencies in parked cars and pavement.  
  
Cars, trucks, buses. Hyperloop.  
  
Rockefeller is happening before our eyes and all you bears are too blind to see it.

Lol you put Skype and zoom in the same sentence. Okay buddy, I guess there isn't much more to discuss here. When ZM is at 500 in a year just remember this conversation. Investors reward disruptors and you have discounted the fact that ZM is just 1.5 years into their new business model and TSLA is 5 yrs into their current business model. Again I'm not a ZM perma bull but when I hear people say it's dead and overvalued I just remember TSLA SHOP and TDOC (although TDOC got slammed recently after going parabolic)

okie dokie
Oh sorry dude. Can't explain that in a post, so I'd suggest reading on debit spreads (at least before you start reading credit spreads). Compare initial risk with the spreads and a long call or put and see how you like them.
MARA dominates RIOT in terms of hash rate
Of course, that always ends well.
Yeah... MARK. Dangit. I'm upside down on this, and it's not like I can just sit on my losses for a few months and it will eventually get back up to where I bought it, because it's not that great of a company. Just a dumb FOMO this morning for me.

!banbet VXX $102 100d
Pretty low, it's up hundreds of percent on the year, could it skyrocket to 1500 and give you a nice return? Yes. Is it likely? Not really. Last time Tesla was this high it took nearly a 50% dump, not telling you to do it or not, just being realistic
But then I won't have time to drink my whiskey and diet
I'm just watching some videos on Bill Hwang and man, what a legend. If he can make it, we all can lol
I've learned that I make more gains on options where the stock starts making 52-week or all time highs, breaking out of a base. Those are the fastest. I've been on TSLA here, but I also have AFRM on breaking above $133, MTDR after breaking above $39 (for me as that might actually be a little late). I ran UPST right after earnings in the high $170s too, played the highs (sometimes just below them with momentum going up) and let them ride.

please tell me you didn't sell since then
Y'all misunderstand stock value. Zoom conference calls interrupted an entire industry and forced GOOGL and MSFT to completely reconfigure how they delivered digital call products.... Zoom is undervalued right now in the same way TSLA was undervalued at 700/share. I don't even have to be a ZM bull to see that.
Some people want to go from poor rich to rich rich and end up poor poor

I don‚Äôt see the INTC hate. Good prices on leaps. Higher quality and quicker chip, although AMD is now leading the race. INTC still holding 80-90% of server data market-share. The reason the price sucks is because of their bi-annual employee buy-back where they all get 10% off.

One can invest in both, there's no "missing out on TSLA" because it's still far from where it should be once the whole market understands the company and stops listening to the trailing 12 months PE retards.
Hopefully we get approval and a good boost

Yeah but I am retarded so I bought $80 puts
The demand for options will open more contract strikes soon. Next stop Tendie Tower.
Yeah, I always say I should buy more - and damn should have bought during that huge dip earlier this year. I actually accidentally got into TSLA when my stupid solar power stock was brought into TSLA, so I got a measely 5 shares. Then it went 1-to-5. Pretty crazy that I'm up 1471% but unfortunately that is only with a few hundred dollar investment, so it's not like I'm rich now.
I bought 2 $350 calls. It was $400 all together and could net me a couple gs. It‚Äôs a good lotto ticket
60B is undervalued as fk. Current earnings are not a good indicator of how valuable this stock is. NET should be valued at at least 200 rn.
Yep, all other big tech down. Wild.
AMZN will probably bounce a bit until earnings, so QQQ puts probably won't work this week?ü§î

No, it's because the volatility is insane; stock went from $10 to $175 in 2 trading sessions; that kind of volatility means every day the expected move is like an earnings situation until it settles down and volume goes away.

My new iPhone 12 mini is HONESTLY pretty terrible. Bought calls on AAPL
Bearish long term but the current market cap is so miniscule that a 100% run up again isn't entirely out of the question. Currently sitting at around $3B and completely fabricated companies have defied logic (looking at you, NKLA)
BMY just moved their ER results from 10am to 8am on Wednesday. You might not have much time left. :')

I tend to do the opposite, wow you‚Äôve been trading options for a while just curious is that working for you on the bullish plays?

Opening at 52 week highs goes against my minimise risk rule.
I‚Äôm new to options trading. I don‚Äôt know how to do that
from an apolitical standpoint, eventually they have to deliver a working product.  Until that point, this thing is going to pump.  At the point when it becomes clear the actual product is a dud/not viable, then it will tank.
My broker doesn‚Äôt have the ticker. That was easy money
People need to stop listening to that clown. He's a perma bear that kept a whole chunk of retail investors betting against the history's greatest bull run. When the market eventually crashes, any profit he makes will slightly offset all the losses he's caused his following.

None of you chuds mentioning COIN because you suck at making plays
My greed has been satiated for today
Im unsure whether to cash out completely and wait for FB earnings, or hold the door with my spy and xlf spreads. Options seem to suggest its going up, or at least heavily hedged incase it does which is why im a bit torn.

On one hand, snap kinda signed its own demised with how poorly it's ads are set up. On the other, the change in apple policy is pretty much a sure thing to impact revenue across the board for anyone who relies on it. Then the last portion is, did the snap plummet already price this in for the rest of FAANG.

Not sure but in NY it's post-tax money, but gains are all tax free when used for qualifying expenses.  And you get a state tax deduction for the contribution, so you potentially safe about 6.5% on up to 5k in contributions.  It's still a good deal.

I don't think that she's technically required to sell TSLA (couldn't find any specific ratio requirements in their prospectus) but I think that she's still a fund manager at the end of the day and doesn't want exposure to some black swan event that could tank one single stock. Buying ARKK is buying the strategy, not just buying the basket of stocks wholesale.

$MARA calls are going to print for the next couple months with the BT-See continual pump
**Reason why $SPY will always go up**

Main requirement to join the S&amp;P 500:

&gt;last reported quarter must be profitable ‚úÖ

&gt;aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ‚úÖ

Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in todays economy.

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 10-20 unprofitable loser companies get delisted from S&amp;P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy constantly and always follows profits.

Why is cathy required to sell stocks like TSLA once it reaches over 10% of the fund? Since she is the biggest bull shouldnt they just say F it, we are going to ride this out to $3K.

And overall?
Whats a logical strike for coin? Im debating on options
I mean whether Tesla can/will deliver 100k cars to them is a whole different story. But I don‚Äôt doubt that they found backers willing to put up the money to buy them.

Lol look at how many ‚Äúorders‚Äù there are for cybertrucks, or less crazy scenario any other cars that are in high demand and now have huge markups. Anyone can place an order. Especially in today‚Äôs car market I‚Äôd also be surprised if HTZ actually got 100k cars.

solid guide but a bit vague. might want to include some stricter and more specific rules like certain percentage thresholds to avoid coping
I would disagree with your first point. Just because a stock hit an all time high does not mean that you shouldn't take a position. Sometimes the catalyst that helped the stock reach that point was capable of taking it that high. My advice would be to take a small position, and if it moves in your favor, then expand its size. 

Number 10 is super critical. I'd even add to it: if you can feel your emotions getting the better of you and you are making poor decisions, take the rest of the day off. Do not force trades where there are none.

Stupid question but I just opened a 529 in MA, is it possible to put pre-tax money in there from employee? Or does it need to come from my bank account in which case obviously post tax. Like how do people usually transfer to 529 to minimize taxes.

I learned how to buy stock pre-market opening today. This now allows me the ability to buy even higher than when it opens for a greater loss. Happy Monday!
I just wrote myself a guide to trading, what else do you think I could add?

1. NEVER buy at all time highs / FOMO
 
2. Always minimise risk when you can 

3. Only focus on 1-3 companies at a time 

4. Cash is still a position 

5. Take profit while you‚Äôre up

6. Don‚Äôt always go all in 

7. Dollar cost average if you are down 

8. Catching the bottom and timing the top all the time is impossible 

9. Listen to your gut feeling 

10. Make sure you‚Äôre in a good headspace when trading
But why not by ITM if you are going for such a short timeframe? Less likely to get Fd by Theta
Put a limit buy on snap at 54 before bed for $1500 worth, kinda hype it went through.

&gt; AAPL 0dte calls

It‚Äôs Monday.

This is not a thing.
Y‚Äôall holding these AMD calls thru earnings? They definitely gonna üöÄ this time
BANBET PUSSY
I hope UPS rips after er so my FDX calls print massively
&gt; I'm not.
I don't think so with the huge holiday deliveries to be made. Maybe end of Dec or beginning of Jan - I would not!
Tesla another rip up EOD?
So we aren't going to crash till 2024. Roger that
/r/stocks - "You should buy and hold SPY, you can't beat the market."

Also /r/stocks - "TSLA is overvalued and needs to crash."

These fuckers do understand what they're asking for at this point right? ....right?
Hope it‚Äôll come back for you, something to cheer you up: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qfiyks/daddy_pamp_all_eyes_on_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
BANBET PUSSY
Anyone buying Etoro/ftcv?  Lotta volume outta nowhere.
If you‚Äôre on the sidelines w/ TSLA, why are you here??
I put my life savings into Tesla calls
If I would have yeeted my cash into DWAC and held, I‚Äôd be a millionaire today. 

Feels bad man.

fomo investors pumping AMD right now
Still should run up into earnings though‚Ä¶
Fed pressure already priced in. Btw, the most bullish price targets already factor in a 10Y rate of 2% or more (currently the 10Y is at 1.627%).

Eoh

SPY poots now.
I'm making enough money on Crocs to buy myself a new pair
Man, If you put money in almost fucking anything at 8:25, 8:30  CST you're making money
I was a TSLA bull until today. Needs to touch 50 day. Over extended

edit: Downvotes won't save your calls
Might fuck around and buy some NVDA $250c for EOY.
Who keeps buying AMC 1/21/22 145cs? The open interest is crazy
If we're talking index funds, every pullback is a dip on a long enough time scale.
Now if only TSLA could rip up
I love how since wsb only bets within weeks to expiration, they never consider someone holding options for next year
MARK looking for hourly bounce follow through. Good low risk trade with stop loss at 4.19
Bulls are so fucking dumb.

This whole shit is about to collapse and SPY is at ATH?? ‚ÄúBut the dip‚Äù and say goodbye to the country

Yes, your calls will likely expire worthless. If it wasn‚Äôt so far out of the money, you might have made something.

A new ATH for SPY.
That's what everybody said about internet fake money. Yeah it dropped a lot during china bullshit but now it's ATH.
After earnings, I'm out. Up nearly 10k this month, 7k this year, and down 3.5k overall. Might be dumb to get out now but the run up we've had in the last month was special and I'm not going to keep buying calls expecting it to happen again. Obviously I'd like to go out at least even overall and being down 3.5k sucks but still up for the year. I've been this close before and have lost it, don't intend on that happening again. Counting my lucky stars and keeping what I got.
No one cares about zoo animals

"the rich will evade taxes no matter what" this is just asinine. this is legit a relatively new thing (last 10 years or so), if they were evading them perfectly fine before why come up with this. it's a game of cat and mouse and always has been. thats why we update the tax code lmfao

also they don't leave, not even when the top tax bracket was 90% in the greatest productivity and middle class expansion this country saw.

9/12? Aren‚Äôt they already expired?
I feel like there's a difference between a dip and a pullback. Dips recover to the same trend line and once the trend from before the dip resumes it keeps going like nothing happened. A pullback is like a dip except not fake. Outlook is actually effected and watching the chart will eventually determine a different trend going on from that point compared to before.

point is tax code changes as people change their tax evasion tactics property tax is a wealth tax on avg Americans, this is literally only billionaires to address a specific tax evasion tactic.

I sold 10 11/26 3320 puts and I‚Äôm thinking they‚Äôre getting assigned
Looks like we made money today boys. That means big lasagna for lunch.
I should really have stronger hands. I bought 0dte Spy 455 calls and sold them off at a loss because I got paper hands.
&gt; Tesla is a great company with the most innovative CEO in the world. Elon Musk has been doing amazing things for years now and he will continue to do so as long as Tesla exists. In addition, it's hard not to be impressed by what they have accomplished recently:
So what does burry do all day just watch as all his money slips away?
$100 but I‚Äôm a grower not a shower.
Algos done selling. Let‚Äôs go.
All the things
TESLA, the gift that keeps on giving. 

Should I hold? Got in around 700.
Right now, if you buy the DWAC 11/19 50p and short the 11/19 95p your net credit is about $2.4k out of $4.5k collateral. That is, the market is pricing in a better than 50% chance of this tanking below 50 in three weeks. Although I am bearish on DWAC long term, I think this is unrealistic. Calls, on the other hand, seem underpriced, which is why I am bagholding them and talking about it on Reddit.
Think of it as the ‚Äòrisk on‚Äô ETF. When the market is bullish on speculative nonsense TSLA will rip regardless of fundamentals.

I know that, and it's not like me to bet against it, but it's Monday and mistakes were made
&gt; I am assuming you would be having a mortgage, to which you would be paying interest to your bank.

Nah, preferably not on a home I'm trying to actually live in.

&gt; I don't see how renting your home makes you more secure.

Then would you like some help figuring out what's wrong with your ability to understand the world around you? 

&gt; If anything it makes you less secure since your landlord has keys to your apartment. 

My landlord isn't a major security threat and if he was there's not really much chance a door being locked would stop him. What makes you think in such a silly way?

&gt; Besides if someone is "targeting" you, why would they care whose property you are on.

Because if it's not me then it might be someone they don't want to target. I don't get how you have to ask this. 

&gt; Sounds like you need to move to a different neighbourhood my friend.

What neighborhood is safe from the overlords?

&gt; Are you on the lam or something?

I guess? You could look at it kinda like I'm a runaway slave. Weird framing but it works

&gt; I guess if you are running away from the law, then home ownership is probably out of the question. 

Why do you say "the law?" Maybe it's just me but when you call them that in this context it feels like you mean it unironically. 

Regardless, home ownership isn't out of the question, it's just best to delay until further security measures avail themselves to me. 

&gt; However if you don't have renter insurance you are making a mistake IMO.

Why would I want renter insurance? It doesn't protect from anything significant unless a lot of your net worth is in expensive wood furniture or you like living in a flood plain with nowhere to park your car or some dumb shit like that. Unless I'm missing something

&gt; That is a negative, unless you want to be a monk and make a poverty vow, in which case be my guess and go live with the Lord.

What do you mean?
Why did you hold? I sold mine the next morning when they were down 45%.

If it can't hold $454 then I'm going to guess the double top is in.  Sell-side volume will probably increase from noon until close in preparation for an ER miss from FB and bearish guidance from the rest of the S&amp;P 500 bigs citing inflation and supply chain issues.

Yes, I was adding that the merger rumor was denied which you did NOT say. Smh.

They aren‚Äôt as in sync today either
My move was FB call 12/17
Unpopular opinion but Tesla split probably not a great idea. Psychologically i think its scarier to short a big number. I think thats why AMZN doesnt split.

guys im so anxious what if the US dollar collapses i don't think i have enough silver QE fed taper *hyperinflation* its imminent bro people aren't prepared bro the fed literally has a money printer that's how money works im not prepared to look into this but everyone saying it so its true, inflation isnt stopping its only oing up and hasn't slowed the past couple months at all
Hertz just saved the TSLA 10/29 $1000 calls

yes, but that won‚Äôt be done until at least the end of the year and I doubt that Trump would not merge over the shares from the SPAC. It would dick over his voter base too bad, but considering his track record it‚Äôs honestly a 50/50

I thought you guys were retarded, but then I found r/phunware
Yeah I noticed that too. Volume had been pretty lackluster all last week.

Holy shit, TSLA is really up 50% in 3 months.
I just wanna say I‚Äôm very impressed but Teslas rally very impressed
The breakout started at $114, and AMD continued after INTC's weak report. I feel like AMD has taken market share from INTC, and if that's true, then AMD is going to run up to $130. That's a big IF though.

Still making clown decisions I see
Stop trading these shit stocks. TSLA hitting $1k.
I was told that you couldn‚Äôt climb over walls once they are built.
How do you people afford to buy multiple TSLA calls???
QQQ...how green? Just TSLA? Everything else whacked.
I bought more AAPL calls because I fucking hate money.

&gt; TSLA is a joke. I'm all in on FB
Have you ever seen the documentary, "Battlestar Galactica"? Japan may be ahead of the rest of us.
It's a SPAC. They could cancel the merge at any moment and it trades for a dollar.

That's obviously it's true purpose.  Tesla will absolutely be a space company.
&gt; I'm talking about the weekly options.

COST is a fucking monster 500 EOM
The most amazing thing about TSLA mooning isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs rising so sharply, but the fact that the bid-ask spreads have been surprisingly tight, meaning it‚Äôs way easier to buy/sell options
Most likely, with another dip

BAN , up 3.8% , wtf is this boomer shit
Weird my top two performers today are TSLA and VLO, two companies whose business model is predicated on the other going out of business
This is literally the only basis by which they choose new price targets. It‚Äôs insane the market reacts to the analyst predictions like this.
Whats the news?
The RSI is called the relative strength index. Most stocks stay between a 30-70 level. Anything below 30 us considered oversold and the stock is expected to bounce back soon. Same goes for anything above 70. Now, a stock's RSI can stay above 70 or below 30 for quite some time, but if that RSI keeps climbing like how TSLA has done going up to an RSI of 88 right now, then it'll start showing signs of a top (could be a 1-2 day top), and drop back. Now, the RSI will drop from 88, but that doesn't mean it'll drop below 70, because it can stay above 70 for a longer period like weeks, I've seen about a month as the longest ones.

If you have a short term position, like a weekly call position like mine, then these signals are a sign to get out now. If you hold the stock or a longer term option position, then you have time and can ride out this 1-2 day drop that's expected.
Honestly selling $50p weeklies is the move here
Edit: I'm a retard, options are written for november

And we actually have a brand, not a reseller. I know tons of other large sellers going through this with them. Amazon gonna shit the bed

It takes one message from Trump to send $DWAC over the sell wall at any time. People are hesitant to evaluate DWAC for lower than 90 atm. Either that or a sudden, high volume of buys to shove it through, and considering Trumps base it is very possible
If daddy bezos shorts tsla i will tooo

What these shills don't get, the crazy hate that Trump gets isn't marginalized because of his suspensions/bans...  Do they not realize that the people who hate Trump so passionately will create accounts on this new social media site just to fill their need to respond to him? Do you know how many psycho liberals... and to a degree, some conservative, lives are in disarray without hanging on his every word? And then the 2022 and 2024 campaign? They will call it their "duty" to create accounts on TRUTH to respond to his alleged " lies "   It's like these people who create these stories, don't know we are aware of their agendas.

Yeah so get rich and get out before pop
Tesla trading like it‚Äôs a small cap. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
&gt;If I owned I don't see how any of my money would go to the bank

I am assuming you would be having a mortgage, to which you would be paying interest to your bank.

\&gt; However, the "no trespassing" signs on the property would now be mine, so there's no reason anyone targeting me would adhere to them

I don't see how renting your home makes you more secure.  If anything it makes you less secure since your landlord has keys to your apartment.  Besides if someone is "targeting" you, why would they care whose property you are on.  Sounds like you need to move to a different neighbourhood my friend.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  Tax records aren't mine, insurance isn't mine

Are you on the lam or something?  I guess if you are running away from the law, then home ownership is probably out of the question.  However if you don't have renter insurance you are making a mistake IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; no connection exists between the equity of the property and my net worth

That is a negative, unless you want to be a monk and make a poverty vow, in which case be my guess and go live with the Lord.

Really nice double bottom formed on the year chart. Snapchat was the cause of social media stocks falling. Facebook is going to show it was just a Snapchat issue. Facebook has other means to bring in revenue. Snapchat has a horrible system to display ads that are fucking annoying and that‚Äôs literally all they have.

If I owned I don't see how any of my money would go to the bank. However, the "no trespassing" signs on the property would now be mine, so there's no reason anyone targeting me would adhere to them. Living behind "no trespassing" signs and fences that *aren't mine* is obviously a major factor for personal security, you don't understand how shit works if you can't understand that. Aside from the possibility of getting shot in your sleep this applies to all kinds of other factors. Tax records aren't mine, insurance isn't mine, no connection exists between the equity of the property and my own liquidity or net worth, etc.

To actually own property you have to be capable of guaranteeing that you will successfully stop anyone from forcing you to permanently leave the property, and for owning property to be a good idea you have to also be pretty sure you can stop anyone from using the property or the liabilities attached to it against you. Most people who buy property and pretend to have ownership of it are too poor or incompetent or whatever to even remotely hope to stop any of this shit from being done to them so renting would just make more sense for them by giving them someone else's protection and detachment from all kinds of liabilities. For the time being, that includes me. It's most sensible for me to try to avoid buying land until I'm rich enough to own it.

What?  That makes no sense your personal security has nothing to do with whether you are renting or own your property.

&amp;#x200B;

The math is simple.  If you rent, 100% of your money goes to your landlord.  If you own, some of your money goes to the bank, some goes to house maintenance but some of it you get to keep.  The longer you own, the more you get to keep.

I've been watching selling at low volumes (temp price drop) vs  high volume sell offs which I think indicate a long term bear trend. BTFD !!
Who bought mark at 9$
Tesla PE ratio at 300. Way too low IMO.
except people have to sell their stock for that to work

Ok fiiiiine Corsair will go up tomorrow
It's down from $142
The more Tesla flies‚Ä¶ the more people are willing to put those profits in buying a Tesla. Infinite money glitch for Elon.
It has dumped
It won‚Äôt until it does. But promising people that their cars will be appreciating assets making them $30k a year probably had at least some effect.
Fuck that scammers spac
not really lotto if you already know your maximum profit.
same here with TDA. I wanted to scalp money from dumb people today, but they said no.
I fumbled the TSLA bag boys
Probably not.  Puts be expensive
PINS puts are staying high, it's going to fall
The market should pump until every stock has a PE of at least 100
I think Elon should invest some of the cash sitting there in one or two more factories next year (UK or eastern Europe would be good), obviously more huge orders coming soon as car rental companies go electric.
That math is way off

Lol. It's funny how people are buying Tesla at this price! And in couple of weeks later they'd be crying and whining.

What was that opening guh? seemed to happen to everything
did that in June/July with all the clov and bb bagholders that were trying to justify their at -50%. One lesson I learned is that after the stock is pumped for the first time it will surely retreat. It could skyrocket eventually, but not immediately the week after

U mean buy?
Agreed. I even bought shares after the SNAP news. People forget its weight in the S&amp;P. Buyers will come regardless
I thought spy calls are free money this week?

This is the stock that spends more time halted than trading.

I moved from L.A. to the Midwest, and outside of liberal metro areas, there are a ton of people in this country ready to put their money on a different company, especially in rural areas, they actively avoid facebook and anything liberal. 40% of the voters went for Trump, that's a good market, there is a big pushback against wokeness. Agree with your point, though. They will need to build their own stuff, and they aren't good at tech.

Stop orders.  I bought at 13, stop sold at 18.  Bought back at 42, stop sold at 50.

&amp;#x200B;

Friday morning I bought back in at 110, stop loss triggered at 82.  Bought back in at 105, could have sold around 130 to break even but I wasn't going to sell for less than 150 because I was so angry that my stop loss got triggered.  So not only am I down overall on DWAC but am bagholding.

&amp;#x200B;

I learned some valuable lessons though, next meme stock rocket ride I will not set stop orders.
yup and more will be buying at $175
F still incredibly down on my paypal calls
RIP PINS holders
&gt;whether the coin is considered a circulating coin or a bullion coin, the accounting treatment is the same. Like a quarter, the difference between the face value of the coin and it‚Äôs cost of reproduction is booked as seigniorage. When the Mint ships the coin to the Fed, the seigniorage is transferred to the treasury‚Äôs general fund where it is available to finance government operation, just like the proceeds of bond sales or tax revenues.

# TSLATARDS MAINTAIN SHREK DICK FORMATION
&gt; What are you talking about? Eminent domain? Condominium ownership?

I guess those are two of the things I'm talking about, so I'm not really understanding the question? Seems like you understood the plain English but you're asking what it meant anyway, kinda weird 

&gt; Even in those cases you would be better off with property that increases in price.

And what about all the cases where I wouldn't, or the case where the property doesn't increase in price? 

&gt; You seem to imply that the housing prices are about to collapse

If it seems that way to you that's because you're lying to yourself to avoid thinking about what I'm saying. Nothing I've said actually remotely suggests I might think housing prices are about to collapse.

&gt; I personally just sold my house for more than double what I paid for about 10 years ago, which is allowing me to: quit my job, move closer to my family and either retire or not have to worry about work for a few years.

Do you not recognize how much more luck was involved in that than had you simply invested via financial markets?

&gt; Your mileage may vary, but worse case scenario your house doesn't increase in value that much (or at all), but you still have a place to live that is your own.

No, worst case scenario I get shot in my sleep because I lose my landlord's protection of the property.
No liquidity yet ü•µ
LOL, I think they halted DWAC
CHWY puts is more of guarantee easy money
Holy fuck, 5k for options on DWAC, it's all you guys.
Why are you buying puts in this environment. And also the S&amp;P 500 is weighted towards mega-cap companies that are actively buying back shares.
Let the halts begin.
You degens realize that the most you will probably make on dwac is 2x your investment if that. The time has passes for big gains.

My only concern with DWAC is lack of infrastructure.  Can‚Äôt host a website when they‚Äôre being shut down by their hosts due to external pressure.  

On top of that, their slide deck is fucking nuts.  Like, they‚Äôre claiming they‚Äôre going to compete with all on FAANG+?  I don‚Äôt see how they can compete with Disney/Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Apple for content for TMTG+ without ending up like late 2019 Netflix, just full of shitty originals that appeal to only the barely conscious media consumer.  This becomes doubly concerning when you look at how risk averse media companies are to being tied to bad press, which TMTG will surely have plenty of, regardless of it is warranted or not.  This doesn‚Äôt factor in the advertising woes.

I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôll sit this one out and wait for some sort of concrete plan of action.  Otherwise, this will be the Taj Mahal of social media.
They're definitely doing it for our own good, and not so they can sell them themselves.
just look at the volume

What are you talking about?  Eminent domain?  Condominium ownership?  Even in those cases you would be better off with property that increases in price.

You seem to imply that the housing prices are about to collapse, I don't agree with you on that.  The real estate market might be slowing down (at least here in central Ontario) but real estate is still a good holder of value.  Besides with high inflation it is better to hold debt.

I personally just sold my house for more than double what I paid for about 10 years ago, which is allowing me to: quit my job, move closer to my family and either retire or not have to worry about work for a few years.  

Your mileage may vary, but worse case scenario your house doesn't increase in value that much (or at all), but you still have a place to live that is your own.

Why the fuck is mango 120 already
What the fuck. Donald pump.

&gt;but small caps have been crushed this year

This is what I don't get. Yes boomers are boomers but they're still right about the fact that $SPY is and has always been a bull's best friend, it's a historical fact. If they want to increase risk &amp; return they could buy LEAPs or monthlies on $SPY. I just don't get how the fuck anyone would turn that down and prefer mango or GME instead.
That sounds way too low.
Hoping this WISH CFO announcement wasn't saved for earnings for a reason. Weird time to announce with earnings being so close. If only people bought $WISH shares instead of options. Should be an interesting week. What is interesting is their new CFO was CFO at Shutterfly after a buyout.

Maybe. If you think it's going to split, that wouldn't technically make it any better or worse of a move before hand. However, a split would make options more affordable, so increase the pool of people that can buy them. Take that however you wish.
yeah. and precious metals were also getting "very interesting" last year in this sub.  SLV p&amp;d, anyone?

Please read this. HERTZ doesn‚Äôt buy cars for Elon, or because it makes people look cool. The rental car industry makes decisions purely on reliability. And value.

That‚Äôs the reason we are up. The Wall Street knuckle dragger‚Äòs are finally realizing the truth, that the sustained media campaign regarding build quality is mostly cherry picked nonsense.

The total cost of ownership of a model three is superior to a Camry right now.

You guys may not appreciate it but the fudsters have done all of us, and me personally, a massive, titanic favor over the past few years. It has given us time to get in before this company becomes the biggest company on earth.

Precious metals are getting very interesting.
The metals with the highest potential rewards are:

1. Silver

2. Gold

They also experienced the same kind of GME short-selling bullshit, but at much much higher levels.

Silver has a rate of 50,000% of short selling.
Gold has a rate of 25,000% of short selling. I‚Äôm also surprised about these rates.

Well, here's my ideas:

I don't think it is, things are only getting better for the company, massive short positions are still there underwater, it would be wise for them to let it hit 1k and get it over with.

Your call are adjusted for the split. Example you have 1 call at $1000 and it splits 2-1.  You now have a call for 200 shares at $500 instead of 100 at $1000
ü•≠ = üí∞

The relative value stays the same. Stock splits the same ratio the options split. I was holding during the last split, it's not perfect but good enough. Just like everything there are winners and losers.
yep I agree shorting this one for sure
No.

I know some of you fuckers still have DWAC you bought at $10 and I demand gain porn
Lesson learned: never doubt üçä man
Remember that whichever dodgy spac you were thinking of trading today, you can trade the warrants even when the main stock is halted. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
So SPACs that are scams are fine now? Is it one of those two wrongs make a right kind of things?
&gt; The stock market is a zero-sum game. One person's loss is another person's gain, and vice versa.
Ok so my advice on options is if you‚Äôre ever up over 100%, take the profit.  It feels worse to go from up 100 to selling at a loss than it does to leave money on the table
Looks like I'm buying 4-5 times the amount of GME today than originally planned...Thanks 45!!!!ü•≠
Should have caught it in the Friday after hours. There was plenty of liquidity.

Here's a tip for next time : For comparison , use enterprise value. Or atleast Market cap.

Using share price exposes you as a noob.
that's the opposite of the truth though. the fact that it would be made out of platinum and very much not $1T worth of platinum would be further proof of what fiat currency truly is

if it had to be made up of $1T worth of material, *that* would be the death of fiat
nope, all long portfolio, literally never shorted a ticker in my life lol

At the precise moment u/Nervoustumbleweed walks into the supply closet and picks up a replacement box of staples, the train careens off the tracks just as it passes by the office. Radioactive waste spews everywhere, covering u/Nervoustumbleweed. 

The waste left him *changed*. *Mutated*. He could feel that he had new powers. *Abilities.* by focusing his body and mind, he could staple full reams of paper by slapping them with his palm.

As someone who is also 27, for sure keep working. Invest as much as you can and grow that thing to something more meaningful. 48k a year does not get you very far, specially once married with kids. Think about what is important to you and set a goal. I wouldn't consider retirement until 100k after tax, and even then probably wouldn't pull the trigger until after 150k. I was on track to finish the year +50k from options, until I blew up my account last week and lost +100k

PYPL's move was due to PINS merger talk. The price was rumored to be $45B for PINS. That would have put PYPL in a big hole. Once that rumor was removed, PYPL easily returns to pre-merger news. SNAP already had its report, and what a surprise. You'll get a small dead-cat bounce for sure, but $75 by December is not going to happen. As for FB, it's just been dragging at the bottom of the dumpster. It's going to need some good earnings report. Careful grabbing these ahead of the report, less you see what happens to SNAP. My play on these social ads play would be TWTR (safest with no wild news). TWTR surprise upwards, and you will see a gap. The other one would be GOOGL as that one has showed solid earning reports the last few quarters.

It's Mango. He'll reverse split it however many times he needs to have a higher share price than at least Amazon, but maybe even BERK-A. Not even hyperbolic, he's about as superficial as you an get.

Trump's entire business model is 'it doesn't have to be a quality or luxury product, it just has to present as a quality or luxury product'. That will not survive as a publicly traded company.

Plus this is all probably an entire game to copyright the word 'Truth' which is going to fail miserably. Truth Social sounds like such a shit name that the idea of copyrighting the word Truth is the only angle that makes sense. He wants to legally have the 'ownership' of the word 'Truth'.

In my particular case it's mainly just the fact that I'm one of the greatest minds on Earth, so the overlords will do anything they can to stop me from bringing them to justice, and if I buy a property right now before I'm capable of protecting it, then attacking the property would be one of those things they can do. As long as I have a good landlord, it's just one less thing they can do to me. I don't have to worry about them sending the IRS to falsify tax records to take my home away or sending a hit squad to kill me in my sleep or FBI thugs to break my shit and steal my personal data while I'm away from home, because my landlord owns the property and guns and I don't, and the deep state is programmed not to consider anyone with property and guns to be less of a priority than anyone without property and guns, and me and my landlord don't work together enough for the system to recognize us as connected or factor teamwork by us into its planning. If I bought a property, then:

1. their program would probably no longer have any reason to rank stopping me as less important than the consequences of stopping me, and
2. collateral impact on the owner of my home would no longer be a side effect of using my home as a route of attack 

So in my particular case it's not really about losing money or anything, it's also a matter of national and global security. 

But my comment wasn't really about my particular case, it was about everyone else. The concept of buying property is just insanely overrated among the general populace and everyone keeps recommending it to me for no good reason. That's why I was talking about risk. For me it's not really a matter of risk - I'm at risk if I own a property I can protect, but if I buy a property right now I'm just fucked, there's not any chance I'm allowed to continue since I just gave the deep state a super easy way to stop me, so there's no risk involved. For a normal person, there is a chance the overlords might let you keep your home after buying it, but no guarantee, so I just don't understand how so many people can be retarded enough to act like that's a wise thing to put any significant amount of money into.

If everyone else was safe buying property then it would be obvious the reason they recommend it to me is because they don't understand my particular case as an enemy of the state. In that hypothetical, then from their perspective it is a safe, wise financial decision, so it makes sense that they try to convince me of that when they don't understand my situation.

But that hypothetical isn't the situation we're living in. Everyone already is at risk even without being an enemy of the state, otherwise why would someone like me be an enemy of the state in the first place? Given that everyone who buys property is putting themselves at risk, where does this premise even come from psychologically?

Hence my conclusion at the end of my comment - that this is a malicious crabs in a bucket thing. Subconsciously, these people understand how fucked they are if their luck is bad, and most people are just so fucked up and shitty that trying to make others take the same risk helps them cope with that and bottle up the fear.
You don‚Äôt even know how pissed I am lol
More covid19 = less tampering = bullish

Please read this. HERTZ doesn‚Äôt buy cars for Elon, or because it makes people look cool. The rental car industry makes decisions purely on reliability. And value.

That‚Äôs the reason we are up. The Wall Street knuckle dragger‚Äòs are finally realizing the truth, that the sustained media campaign regarding build quality is mostly cherry picked nonsense.

Call?
As soon as there is a DWAC comment people assume you have some opinion of Trump. I thought we are here to make money investing in all the evil world has to offer. There is no "moral" premium and moral ground here.

The reason why I will not touch $DWAC has nothing to do with the investment merits but has to do with how it is traded and will be for a while. My prognostication is that it will be traded with feeling. Those feelings are wild and swing on whims. I don't like that.

Good luck to you all who are short and long. I will cheer you from the sideline but this ain't the game for me.

4K month is fine if single, but if you want to have a family, things will be tight - especially with the rate of inflation we are seeing.
that's a fair opinion. but can't you see why some people maybe think that something *should* be done? the public health impact of social media is worse than that of mcdonald's and microsoft and even phillip morris (and to be fair action has been taken against cigarettes so that's not a great example for your point) because of the "social" aspect. it becomes contagious.

I mean why wouldn't I want to make 3.5% down on a house at elevated levels by acquiring half a million dollars in leverage to have a negative net worth when wages can't catch up to inflation. I guess you could be betting on hyper inflation, short the dollar via massive loans. Nothing like betting against the strongest currency on Earth by risking it all on the housing market.

i agree there is a personal responsibility aspect of it. but it's not so black and white. the social media company's can't be just completely devoid of responsibility when they have highly advanced AI that is intended to hog as much of its users' attention as possible and has repeatedly proven to be showing them problematic content without the user even realizing.

I do think that the january 6th rioters should be punished, but i also believe that companies like facebook hold some kind of responsibility to not let that kind of mental poison run rampant.

also i think it's wrong to call for 100% "personal responsibility" when we're talking about children and teens who are still developing their brains

sure that would be great. this actually deals with one of the issues. this whistleblower says that facebook intentionally makes their product addictive and tries to make it more addictive rather than less. if that's the case then they are essentially a parasite draining their users' mental health for more money and therefore is becoming a public health problem. if your solution is "people should put down their phone and go outside" then there needs to be heavy regulations on social media company's algorithms

If you're a good landlord you deserve the money for protecting your tenants from Uncle Sam. My landlord is great so I'll definitely continue taking his protection until I've grown powerful enough to own a property too. It's just bizarre to me that so many people are retarded enough to buy a property when they don't have the power to enforce ownership of it and it gets annoying hearing those people try to convince me they're not the retarded ones, like they can't handle knowing they're at risk of having their whole wealth level downgraded over any random housing issue without trying to convince me to put myself in the same risk.

A lot of people over the weekend saying DWAC would tank today. The peak already happened, and it was going right back down to $10. Everyone who didn't sell by end of day Friday were losing everything today.

A company based in Montreal did the same thing a few years ago (teo taxi). The owner went on tv to explain that tesla were much cheaper in the long run. He went bankrupt like 4 weeks later haha. They were all model s thought, i think model 3 offer a lot more rentability.
Yall hear about that creeping shadow that made the movie crew move the camera lol
Remember when Elon was desperate and said funding secured at $420/share, pre-split? Had an alleged plan with a Saudi fund. Then he settled with SEC bc of loose lips. Fast fwd two years, Tesla is 11X more valuable than the "funding secured" tweet. Pretty interesting
TSLA calls are expensive as fuck for a reason i see

According to the calculator, you'll be up about $450 per contract at open if it stays around $945. If you bought at $160 that is.

As i see it leverage is like loan to buy stock, so fee should be viewed as interest rate for said loan. You can view options the same way. If I invest 1000 usd with 20x leverage that means i get a loan of 19000 usd. If year fee is 35% of initial investment (350 usd) that means i get loan for less than 2%/year. IMO thats a crazy good deal.  Market needs to go up YTD just 1,5% for me to cover fee.  Also 2%/year is less than inflation. Witch means its cheaper to buy sotck with any leverage than to use your own money as inflation "fee" for holding stock is more than fee for leverage.

As stocks only go up biggest risk on using such high leverage is being margin called with flash dips. For 20x to get margin called SP500 needs to go down just 2,5%. Thats not a lot. So for long term better use 5x for indices and 2x for stocks.

Investment in real estate using mortgage is the same as using leverage for stock only mortgage fee usually is more expensive than 2% year interest.

Warrants are exactly calls, just not standardized (ie slightly weird maturity dates compared to the maturities of listed options) and they're issued by (mostly) banks. So the 680 you see there is the strike price. The 1:400 ratio you see simply means that this warrants represent 1/400th of a call option (or 1/40000th of a contract on 100x underlying), not relevant anyway because what you care about is how much % you make by investing your money, an analogy would be to say that such a warrant is to regular options what fractional shares are to shares.

One downside is that the liquidity is only provided by the bank which sold you the warrant. They're the market maker. And they can decide to not buy back your ridiculously OTM call (yours is deep ITM so you're fine) and propose you a bid of 0.01‚Ç¨.

Can someone keister a Nokia cell phone into trumps social media prison cell so he can tweet out DWAC to the Moon??
I‚Äôve used all my margin on BNTX last week mate all about the gamble
DWAC let‚Äôs go üèπ
You should never bet against the american military-industrial complex. My country just bought 8 U.S fighter jets for 1.5 billion dollars which is twice the amount of our yearly military budget, despite the fact that we are an EU member and could have bought cheaper EU alternatives.
What are Donald apes called? Mangoloids?
Wtf is happening to MARK? It‚Äôs going straight into a trading halt when the market opens.
People are still in that? Shiy
Opening above 455 ez
I just saw Benedict pre market I‚Äôm going to cum
Is GME getting dumped for ü•≠? If it keeps tanking, you know what it means.
Investing in any stock is bag holding. Why marry a stock where there are so many 10s out there on any given day?
i read that in donald trumps voice with the pause and look right and left he always does
Panic = more calls
Apparently bagholding shitty stocks is a lifestyle now.
Holy shit I think we might rally hard ü•≠
Unless you time UVXY within two days of a big market fall it will just kill you.
Sir, do you know where you are? Ban
Is uranium going to pop again before thanksgiving?
SNAP FDs anyone??? 75c going for 0.08
Apes are pushing DWAC too?

Well that doesn't surprise me at all.
surely MU and CHWY will have their day, but I wish it was sooner
AMC low today, think I‚Äôm gonna jump in
For that long the fee will eat on your gains, you will have 35% on your initial investment for holding one year in fees alone.

Option have way better risk/return than cfd
I saw that, but CNBC doesn‚Äôt want to acknowledge it
All in $INTC ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶the next trillion dollar company. China will Taiwan back just like Hong Kong.

Nah it's back now, Elon just fucked the FUD writers a few minutes ago.

\- Question: what do they mean with 680? How would I make profit?  
Thank you
Omg PYPL actually bailed me out. My dumbass weeklies gonna print
I did my first leverage play last week - 10x on BNTX at $258, I‚Äôm holding til closer to earnings
I‚Äôm not an iNvEstOr Tom, I buy when the probability of making money is higher than of losing money
Pretty sure Valve is holding onto it
Lube up and get ready to swallow
Portfolio looks like shit and UVXY is killing but I almost started to short TSLA and decided not to. So I'll take that as win
Open
Nvda picking up steam
If you make money with tsla rn you will prob lose this money somewhere else. Greed is never the right choice.
Italy no have a lot of $$, I gonna Hava looka into dis
Ban. This is an options sub
CNBC: Tesla pulls FSD beta due to software issues. 
Tesla stock: can‚Äôt stop won‚Äôt stop
Hahahahaha
Looking at the charts for PINS, it could easily drop to 35 which was its previous support.
The IRnT sub is depressing as fuck.
That subs as bad as the gme one already
Imagine not owning any TSLA
SPY calls at open or EOD
this is wsb, we aim for 480% in a week not 10 months tf

So I guess every random running stock gets its own sub now? Ultra cringe as I check the dwac one and the top voted is a gme amc bagholding ape fitting them all with tinfoil hats already. Other messages of its not about the money its about sending a message. So fucking lame
TSLA 1000 EOW easy
Dang, my TSLA 10/29 950 calls that I bought for a few bucks may print
!RemindMe in 22 hours
RIOT, MARA, HUT all up 3% plus premarket
RIP

No one, your 200 in 0tdes are going to be worthless. Should have just kept it for a new pair of shoes kid
I bought my first call on AMC, mommy I‚Äôm scared
What else is there to do in Russia?  You get three choices: potato farmer, shoemaker or hacker.
1000 c brooooo it‚Äôs pretty easy
I just saw TSLA premarket and came
God! give me strength to carry these PINS bags.
I dont have options available at my country, but i have availability to use leverage up to x5 on stocks and x20 on indices like SP500 or even x30 on currency. I wonder why i dont see any posts or discussions about using very high leverage on less risky stocks or SP500 to get lambo. SP500 is up 24% ytd.. that would mean 480% gains with x20 leverage
Yes me too
I wonder what they will be worth at open
NIO has absolutely no correlation to TSLA being at ATH. No Chinese EV‚Äôs do. Stop looking for the 2nd Tsla. It‚Äôs TSLA.
Government supplied amphetamines, begin training at a young age and basically told ‚Äúthis is what your life is‚Äù, treated in high regard within their community
Bank earnings, TSLA, FB earnings runup, infa package incoming. Who else thinks SPY $460 can hit today?
910s here for me
TSLA is moving and has been
DWAC hold and enjoy the roller coaster rideüòÇ
Literal calls on Faze
Holy shit I caught the train early on Mark. Lambo printing
probably loosing the titel as first world country in the next decade.
Earnings are on Thursday?
Extremely bullish on NIO as TSLA breaks ATH, Tech recovers, and as memes are back on the menu
I would sell put credit spreads below 900 for sure
905s here
Forgot about the three day rule
oh shit I'm here early, I don't even know what to think yet, my brain hasn't been filled by the doubt from you guys yet
It's not a dildo...
Woke up with two huge ü•≠s, hope I don‚Äôt have some kind of PHUNgus!!!!!
so CLF to 30$ confirmed?
Both figuratively and literally
I think everyone moved to the DWAC subs.  They all took their money out of the Memes looks like.
May be a bumpy ride but I hope it does well
TSLA blasting off holy shit
I'm one of those dummies that bought CCS on TSLA thinking it'll retrace back to 900 this week. Well fuck me...somebody quick! Put a paper bag over my head and beat me senselessly with a dildo--because that would be less humiliating than what I'm feeling now.
Wow, how the hell did Russia become such good hackers? They making the world look like a joke
You gonna be richer than you already are !
$MARK just threw another K in and upped my buyin.
All in on $950Cs expiring in March
I can't believe we're mostly green today.  I expected slightly red.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Nokia dropt just before the Q3, will it bounce back? We will see within 3 days üôè
Really want to FOMO into TSLA right now.
Bought 20 910‚Äôs at the close on Friday ;)
So who bought Tesla 10/29 900c‚Äôs
Which of you dummies bought PINS calls instead of PYPL?
i‚Ä¶ I-i- is it actually infrastructure week
Wonder how my bags are going to do today
Tsla going ham gonna wait for intraday dip and buy some 11/5s
Think 99% sub got wiped from buying puts
It‚Äôs OCGN time
Damn it‚Äôs a slow morning
Elon printing billionaires out hurr

That's the thing.... When bears start turning into believers, that moment is the time to start looking for an exit. The makers arent going to let the peasants book another 30% Annual return... They will make sure it's back to it's 5-7% soon enough, so they can book their 200% returns on either side.

Lol
Uhhh
üòÇ facts but we‚Äôll see next week
Finally someone who sees it my way
üëåüèº
Viable
Let‚Äôs revisit next week, Friday before earnings
If you don‚Äôt see any opportunities sure
Right. Just not immediately lol
Any of the big banks should hold 5-10% of your total portfolio for stability. Think BAC, rates will rise so they should benefit. Shares of course with DRIP and no options. Travel will will be like cruises, airlines or hotels. Don‚Äôt be afraid to hold cash and don‚Äôt FOMO. Watch Josh Brown or Steve Weiss to get some trade ideas. They are really informative.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is a list of the top 500 companies in America. The stocks are weighted by market cap, so Apple (AAPL) has more weight than PepsiCo (PEP). If you want to buy into an index fund that tracks the performance of all these companies, then I would recommend Vanguard‚Äôs VOO or Fidelity‚Äôs VFIAX funds.
How do I figure out what stocks are good to invest in? I know there is an s&amp;p 500 chart and there are websites that have insider purchases but I have no idea ho to read and properly understand what I need to know. I‚Äôll take any advice you can give me if you don‚Äôt mind
I am aware of that. Unfortunately, their training system is rubbish. I don't believe you can pair it up with apps, such as Zwift either.
You can get a subscription to their training service too, and I think it's actually cheaper if you bring your own tablet.
470c for me
Cool bro. Good luck
Stfu
Forsure lol - I had PayPal shares for a while but just recently got back into wsbs and options. Although I don‚Äôt get how they work on fidelity, have to still use stupid RH. I‚Äôll keep a look out
You're gonna lose money that way. I say this coming from -22k for the year on NVDA calls that were very poorly timed or i got greedy on and lost it all the way down to zero. NVDA fluctuates wildly and has for years.
So‚Ä¶ boeing huh?
Yes Boi, cheers, same as to you
Best o luck next go, bro
Long term? You talking 100 years from now? These EV companies are far overpriced, first thing is they are not apple or Amazon or Microsoft, should never have a market cap close cause their products are far less profitable and wide reaching. Second thing is that legacy automakers are already starting to catch up, it‚Äôs unreasonable to expect these small brand new start up‚Äôs to gain much of the market share off vehicles
Yeah thats fair, lol and understandable. But i still had a laugh at/with the fates on this one. Up over all through the week, even with me stubbing my toe on this one üçªü§ò
Hold the line next time.  Diamond hands brah.

It will hit 30 and then WSB will FOMO in. I think in 2 weeks.
Overpriced compared to?. Long term people!, long term.
CLOSE TO OVERDOSE
Adderall, but yes. And update I was able to get all but 1 screw out without having a t9 or t8 security torx, so I ended up going to Lowe‚Äôs and had to look for that part for a very long time but eventually found it and literally just now was able to get that last screw out and was able to now remove my disc drive 

WE ARE SO CLOSE
I think Intel is the wallstreet stock since lots of hush rumors of newest chip that supposedly to compete with AMD.  Usually when rumors spawn stocks go up. Let be known I said it first. I expect INTEL to go up by 100 probably 149 specifically. I am strongly retarded on this one.
Isn't the whole thing open-source anyway ?
I agree with that statement. I love NVDA. I was only talking about today because that‚Äôs when my options expired lol.
I wonder how much longer it can get delayed? If they pass it December 23rd. I will be highly amused.
Go fill up that fine Bronco with your horse earnings and take ride.   üòÄ
Yes. Shit trends up all the way to earnings. Than a thousand atm calls sold, next day after earnings crash. Calls get covered and shit trends until next earnings
YOOOOO FUCK YEA. Solid DD just won me $260 off a $50 bet.
Bullish if it happens we getting delayed again it looks like.
I‚Äôll never be able to unsee this
Today lmao
Well they are a car company just one hitch, no cars. So far what 60, a lot of those prototypes. Wait till they have to produce 20,000 next year and cannot, wait till recalls and issues come in, just a matter of time before they get crushed. 

Its all candy canes and sparkles right now, easy when you just shot videos of AI cars, lol lets see them make some, oh and 20,000 all next year, how many does Tesla do a month, lol yep.
It‚Äôs officially announced to December 5th I think. You can look it up to confirm
Why
Don‚Äôt act desperate. Absolute buzzkill. Work on a project, use your math skills to do a stock screener. Do a social media sentiment trackerS put those python skills to good use. Learn tensor flow. Present something as project you did to show that you love this shit. That‚Äôs all I got for you.

Money will flood out of stocks when interest rates are quickly hiked and into safe fixed income derivatives. Who in their right mind would hold at these levels? Almost no upside. If bonds gave me 5-6% soon I'd put everything into that. And since we are currently in the most bought on margin market in history as well, when the selling starts it'll be compounded in an ugly way.
For wich tickers? üëÄ

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

Good catch. I caught it late and saw it was still drilling so I was wary of jumping in at the time. Thought monday would be a better time to jump in.
To reiterate. If it can bounce &amp; maybe consolidate around there. Could be call worthy. I haven‚Äôt acted yet. Though have made good money selling strangles &amp; being directional earlier this year. Haven‚Äôt traded it since Late May.

That is 28 bucks just this year. Too unreal. Get in while you can fuckers. Shipping congestion is not going to be resolved anytime soon. No significant new containerships come up until 2023. 2022 will most likely produce 15-20 in EPS.
It certainly is taking them awhile to pass it. When did they start talking about it? Like two months ago?
I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much. Trend is your friend and that thing has been dying recently and is trading below any meaningful support. Earnings have crucified any company that misses expectations in the least so your odds are still better on puts in my humble opinion

God speed üëç
The options for low strike price were mispriced looks like. I got some for for 0.7 and there was just single digit ask bids on it. The moment I got the option it's price went up 50-60% in less than 15 minutes. The stock price was almost completely flat throughout the trading day.
Really not confident either way but leaning toward gap down

I'm up 78% for the week on my feeble poor persons account, but it feels like its red compared to where it was this morning (+123%).
SPY will go up 5% if the bill passes? lol no

Not even looking like it's going to pass anyways

Because bulls been parading all year despite the future outlook
The Goonies said that, not Sloth.
So I‚Äôve seen that the CEO said Apple IDFA restriction should only affect about 10% of their revenue. [this article](https://www.adexchanger.com/digital-tv/the-trade-desk-surges-in-q3-heres-why-everyone-is-flipping-out/) is kinda old, but he states it shouldn‚Äôt materially affect the business so the danger might be that they surprise people because they‚Äôve been grouped in with other ad tech that is more dependent on mobile
Bullish, unless all priced in of course
Nvidia opens at 320 monday morn have fun

So is the infrastructure bill passing bullish or bearish for the stock market?
Good work lads.

If infrastructure bill passes it will skyrocket 5% or more

So much for playing DVAX earnings, which were stellar. Could have sold the news on ACIP reco of its 2-shot hep B vaccine for all adults. Instead I‚Äôm riding the rollercoaster down 98% on my calls that went from almost ITM to probably expiring worthless next Friday. Pigs get slaughtered.

These were cheap because i bought them weeks out before it jumped.  Cashed in earlier this week on it's big move, took profits and rolled the rest into 3510's.  Still ITM but not as high.  It's a little bit of a risk but playing with house money now and 1% moves are big both ways unfortunately.

That‚Äôs because they have built in overclocking capabilities that AMD doesn‚Äôt have. 

In benchmark tests, it looks like that‚Äôs only an issue if you‚Äôre doing super intensive 3D rendering. Otherwise it stays at 125. 

And it‚Äôs a new chip. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll finesse the efficiency. And no, it‚Äôs not perfect. I do think AMD has the efficiency upper hand. But this isn‚Äôt about that. 

This is about Intel coming back on the rebound. It‚Äôs proving itself to be competitive. For the first time in years.
I just bought AMC calls for the first time since January. I must have lost my mind.
Usman gets the KO

Who you got on Chandler vs Garth Brooks?

Get your ZM puts now, while they‚Äôre still dirt cheap. Growth is stalling. Earnings in a couple of weeks. Bound to sink further.

Yeah I get that but Intel is bigger than both AMD and NVDA. Combined. 

In fact, add NVDA and AMD together and multiply that by 2 and that‚Äôs what Intel makes. 

So for such a big company to turn things around bodes well their future growth.
Ah, yeah you must‚Äôve  bought her videos.
Play it safe and take my gains right into QQQ? Nah. Let‚Äôs ride NVDA all the way home.
Made some super retarded moves the last two days. Whole portfolio now in December spy calls. Fuck this, I‚Äôm a spectator now.

First glance, they are everywhere here, I mean I see their offices, I don't know what they do.

They are present worldwide, so something vague with software. (I'm in IT, should have encountered them)

Last quarter 30M loss on 70M revenue, for IT things that is a small company that is about to be bought out because they will go bankrupt otherwise. 

15B valuation, 142 times the revenue, couple of years ago their valuation would be 1.5x revenue, so 105M or 10 times profit (-1500M)

in comparison, salesforce is valued 20 times more and has 6B revenue last quarter.

Just on the raw numbers, it's 85times overvalued.
Yes.  Won't pass though, GOP has the Senate 52-48.
I'd rather have a one week ban than lose an AMD CC
Someone give me clne confirmation bias
I'm absolutely admiring that guy who had the balls to buy $20k in Peloton puts during a giga bull market. Anyone can make money on calls right now... it takes a hero to spit in JPow's face and score a 10-bagger put based on solid DD.
Great Thanks stranger!

Yeah that‚Äôs what I meant. I read about it and thought it was so retarded it‚Äôs guaranteed to succeed
Wall Street wants to hear data center/cloud/AI/etc.  These players are all VERY focused on power consumption when deciding which chips they will be buying.  Efficiency is key.
I‚Äôm overleveraged asf rn
Anyone else just excited to see Rho make a comeback?
Clearly a bullish signal.
GOEV with higher highs. +24% this month.
I‚Äôm following PayPal‚Äôs movement too. Support is down at $220 range. I‚Äôm going to get in with a small position if it‚Äôs around $210-220. If I miss the rebound, so be it.

the dip after all, is because of rumors pypl would acquire Pinterest, which is has now debunked as false
Seeing all these people wanting SPY to fall and buying puts you can at least give the money to me I promise I won't waste it like you are.
A regrettable turn of events.
They‚Äôll print next week

Wow mcfe. Trade was halted
Please let me know your next 100 plays.
I think it‚Äôs pretty dependent on how many people wanna shift to ddr5. If it were as simple as changing the CPU, I would agree, but the additional cost of motherboard and potentially cooling (cause intel do be hot) might dissuade adoption.
I'm bag holding! But I think they'll be a random rip sometime when OR gets moving with operationalizing shrooms
Yeah, I made some mega retarded moves the last two days to absolutely decimate my portfolio.
There‚Äôs already one called cumrocket and obviously that‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs gonna give you that 1,000,000,000,000% return

So much gain porn lately. Shit is boring and it's all just already rich mfuckas bragging about being more rich. Lame.
It'll come ... But it'll never be when they say it will be ... Until it does
Does it? Because I heard the new AMD chips aren‚Äôt that impressive of a jump in speed. 

Either way, it marks a change in momentum for Intel. 

Also Intel makes 5x revenue. It makes more money than AMD and NVDA combined.
Key whay, ita at 226. Are you saying if it falls below 222.40 get puts?
Thanks brah, god speed I hope you get rich
BABA baby, Once they stop pissing of Xi and finalize that red handshake Baba is gonna bussssss til the end of communism

The Lucid Studio design has translated the company's post-luxury design aesthetic into a welcoming physical environment where customers can review options for the full Lucid Air lineup of luxury, high-performance EVs. This includes the Lucid Air Pure, a very well-equipped model available from $77,400 ($69,900 with available federal tax credit), through the Lucid Air Touring, which starts at $95,000 ($87,500 with available federal tax), and the Lucid Air Grand Touring, starting at $139,000 ($131,500 with available federal tax credit).  
The lineup features models offering more than 500 miles of EPA-estimated range on a single charge and industry-leading efficiency of 4.6 miles per kWh on Grand Touring models. The opening follows first customer deliveries of the fully-reserved Lucid Air Dream Edition. Lucid plans to deliver 520 customer-configured Lucid Air Dream Editions, followed by deliveries of Lucid Air Grand Touring versions. Touring and Pure models are anticipated for delivery to customers during 2022.

Nobody wants to keep their calls over weekend
TSLA shares up 75% this week. Meh probably go up more after hours Friday
Sure I‚Äôm not a techie. But all the techies on yt on tech websites agree this marks the return on Intel.

Place your bets. Although, many of u already did. This is what I‚Äôve been watching.
I just don't see how the market can rationally book a 2021 gain of like 50%.  I'm a retard, but seriously how can 2021 really keep this pace? It doesn't seem rational.

Trying to do a meditation. 1 minute in - ‚ÄúFuck this, what‚Äôs happening with NVDA??‚Äù
Ugghh, I know.  Lost 50k of unrealized gains in this drop but good news is that they are 3510c for next week 11/12.  Was going to cash them out and buy new ones on Monday but got stuck in a meeting when the dumping began.

I mean we tried to tell you all that theres gonna be a 3pm sell off... no1 holding this shit for the weekend
I'm long Intel but your analysis shows you have no idea what INTC is attempting and that current forward guidance is stagnant. 
Alder lake shows that INTC is finally competitive but AMD is releasing a new chip next year that will put them behind on the consumer end again. Big things to watch is if manufacturing can catch up to RnD with the new plants and arc/sapphire bench marks next year. Intel is fucked if they can't pull off the fab update.
Yeah I know people with paid accounts for stuff like hosting virtual D&amp;D sessions.

Mostly business sales I imagine though.
SPY be like Watch Me Nae Nae
Valuation doesnt matter anymore. Look at tsla
Just threw 15k at CLF 24c expiring next week.

Idk, haven't forgot it, but all of those concerns that spurred that are largely intact or even worse. Supply chains are fucked. Labor market is fucked. I don't care what the labor report says, I swear people are not working that company's need. And also, add the ridiculous mandate shit, which any American should be outraged by... Things aren't great on the ground but who knows they might keep pumping.
Nice recovery by 2 of COVID bio stocks. NVAX was down almost 20%, now only down 12%, an 8% recovery. MRNA from down 24% to down 17%, a 7% recovery.
Nvidia 320 call for Nov 12 fucked me hard today. Guess ill hold till next week.
Chamath just tweeted something about CLOV but I didn't read it
Playing both sides for Monday. This thing can either rip up on infra bill and other good news, or finally have a good day or two down after having gapped up almost every day this week.
It's up less than 2%, are you really so starved for green?

Back from my week ban, Zucktard gang still alive? Where ya at?

I was a partial bear until the FOMC meeting. I‚Äôve converted. Pretty sure you will see exactly how it can keep going up next week

I should get in on this action.
I slept on LCID today. Went to the moon after they announced the retail location in Washington DC. I'm sure it's just some kind of media stunt, there's no way they would actually open a retail location before even knowing if anyone likes the vehicle they got...right? They can't be that bad at business...
No selling = no market
PLTR....you sure are a piece of shit arent you?
Oi cunts. If Intel was valued at the same p/e as AMD it would be $200+. Not $50. 

Makes sense since Intel seems like it was behind AMD and NVDA. But their new chips beat AMD, just released THIS week. 

They back in the game with huge upside. 

I see $100 by summer 2022. That 2x on shares alone.
Tesla is down -0.5 and my puts are somehow down -22% HOW
sure. if you mean short-term, then no guarantees tho
I know clov is a joke around here, but maybe take a look. Good technicals, good news, low entry price, earnings monday.

I could see it if we get a good week. You can doubt it, but look at the 1 year graph, I figure it‚Äôll keep going unless something drastic happens
lmaooooo i expected this to happen. weird ass trading day; this would explain it.
Lol I feel you. Down like 40%.
Yes. There is a chance. There is a chance it goes to 465, 450, 485, 500, 200, there's a chance indeed.

gambling my portfolio with lottery.com ... how fitting.
I've started paying pretty close attention to how much I'm paying for the swing I expect to see.  IV is a measure of that across the universe of options but particular options can be relatively expensive or cheap.  And then what you're really betting on is that a big boy is going to decide to open or close a position in shares that moves the price substantially.  As TSLA's market cap goes up, boys with the ability to move that many dollars become scarce on the ground.
Chamath pumpin clov
yes , earnings are 90% of the time a disaster for PLTR
You should probably let your two-year old make them
Absolutely. Remember yesterday when in the last 20 minutes it went up like 2 dollars?

Maybe not a full blast off, but it's up over 6% since Wednesday. Pretty good!
Oh I hope that happens next week, but ain‚Äôt willing to make the bet.

BABA numbers from last quarter must not be good if they moved the ER date to the 18th so they can say some positive things about 11/11 (i.e. China's version of Black Friday)
Fantastic technical setup on KSS going into next week. Retested and confirmed breakout from bull channel, sky's the limit pre earnings
Thanks for selling NET guys, I love you üíóüíóüíó
Need more power in this hour
Should I dump my PLTR? Up 7% and looking to get some more cash on hand
sounds good!
ugh, you probably convinced me to hold on longer. no dip-buying for me

They are AWFUL at earnings calls... Trust me, I know from holding 10000% gain calls overnight to see if open zero, on a beat and increase guidance, they still fucked it up. The cfo is a total fucking amateur.

How am I getting wrecked this badly on such a slow day?  Everything I have is -4% or worse

Feel sort of sorry for Boeing bulls. They get tricked so easily into buying a stock that has literally nothing to do with "reopening". Airlines bought 5x as many planes as they needed for years and now they have a huge glut and can't even find pilots to fly them. The last thing on earth they want to do is call up Boeing and dump more money into that dumpster fire in the hopes of obtaining a few poorly manufactured and dangerous planes
The question is will the market face it's reckoning on Monday?!

I sold my DBX puts a little after market open for pennies. Could've been a thousandaire if I had just held.
hoping college chicks jump on chegg for finals.
SPY! NO MORE WEDGE! SHREK NOW!
2042, Tim apple still trading at $150.   Fker never move
The news is in the earnings report.. which happened yesterday
Its already well above its FV. Been drilling for a while now for reasons I dont know, never really paid attention to paypal, maybe someone else can enlighten me.

IDK, seems risky tbh. If earnings is spectacular then id do in the money calls. other wise proceed at your own risk
Ford is F, FORD is some random company.
Travel stocks are cool again thanks to Pfizer pill üíä üòÑ

AUPH Buyout Monday
Apparently, Rivian has a toxic bro culture:

[Former Rivian executive speaks out, sues company.](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/11/toxic-bro-culture-former-rivian-executive-speaks-out-sues-company/)
SPG past the moon to mars and nobody noticed awww
LOOOL
probably high, today has been a weird ass flat market day. something is up. my guess is exactly the bill being passed AFTER market close.
BAN
Power hour sell or buy?
Good luck you got this remember to embellish and be extremely confident!
earnings, the superbowl, bank charter a lot of catalysts. The type of sexy fintech that has probably the best leadership and board so FOMO is bigly. I can see this 100 a year from now and I think that's what's going on
Flawless victory by thetagang on F.
PTON is comedy gold
oh yeah?

and why do you call it a free money hack?
hm‚Ä¶ I was looking at that too
Be cautious of these WSBers that now think it ‚Äòcool‚Äô to flame on meme stocks like AMC/GME even though they were in it months ago. 

From a technical standpoint, AMC is prime to breakout soon. Idgaf about its popcorn business. Chase the $$$, not internet-cool points.
Up over $7k today. Realized only $5.1k. Have a good weekend folks!
Sold my spy puts for a 75% profit and bought spy calls.

Amd has to pull back right? Its been tearing since july

Then don‚Äôt it it mofo
Infa bill
Lots of people getting iv crushed today not just on ER everything lol
Sold my SPY calls at the top, bought some more at the dip. It seems people are arguing in either direction for why this is a stupid move or not. They're long ITM though so we'll see I guess.
Mara
truth is, I wanted sell one put to buy the BABA dip. tough call
Good luck! currently waiting on my offer in writing from my new job, you got this
Next week is Meme ER Week: CLOV, SOFI, etc.
469 has been a wild ride these past few hours
Rookie mistake, I made them too when I was a young in.

Do I keep my IWM calls? **yes**
SPY needs to rocket to 470 or it‚Äôs going to get bad

What do y‚Äôall think?
Shoulda bought that AMD dip... Foook
Robots trading amongst themselves this afternoon.... Was hopefully just to be over $20 EOD.
Whoever told me to buy AMD calls back when it was $75 where are you I need some more trades
The best time to buy spy calls was 85 minutes ago. The second best time to buy spy calls is now.

or "time to buy puts" and then get destroyed as it keeps rocketing on ape fuel
SPY be like "All your base are belong to us"
Why would he? He beat the game
wait why
erased my previous comment because I didn't know you shorting them. you're a loser bro get a life
The Rivian IPO is so damn bullish for TSLA. If they have any production/software hiccups, they'll be under tons of selling pressure... And all questions will point towards, "But why can Tesla do it and you can't?".... Win-win situation for TSLA bulls.
Those 470 0dt are teasing me!
Tanking after market closes.
spy calls at close? i think the bill might get passed
And you will still get the same answers....
Right before the Big Dip I wanna just drown in this thing
The whole world is watching him, probably made an alt and just posts on that
If you believe in astrology, there‚Äôs a bull flag on SPY 1w
my spy puts were up 120% at one point today and I didn't sell either. this is why we're here
Bers still hoping for a Black Tuesday level crash outside the daily thread. Yeah because the financial system back then and the fed of yesteryear are totally the same and there haven‚Äôt been new tools createdüôÑ.

They could have just bought into a record breaking raging bull market or got on calls but instead they‚Äôre begging for at least 1 of their daily market crash predictions to come true ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) and for us to stop ramming their bear positions
Not worth risking that much capital for such low returns. If you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing just buy 9 stocks for 5k each. See what industries are trending and go with the flow. We are at the end of the pandemic so maybe get some travel/leisure for the year end rally.
Pls god ford 22 EOW
The destroy it ass back
hell yeah brother!
It might be time to go balls deep in SPCE.
Automod is reking shop holy shit
DERE is just fucking themselves and their customers over left and right. 3 week delay on parts now due to this.

YIKES.
I could go for a good milk steak
Maybe. We‚Äôll see after earnings. Companies been getting shellacked for bad earnings lately
Yeah I bought 472 &amp; 480 CALLS for this reason

BRB bout to go watch some porn. Bears getting fucked is my fantasy
If we get another big dip in it I will definitely buy some.  Just funny to me how everyone‚Äôs jumping in now after it‚Äôs ran 60% on the 3 month chart.
Gonna have a flat hour today. BELIEVE IT

Worst feeling ever checking the mic status to make sure it was off
Will DFV ever return to WSB?
Cinemark reported this morning and beat on top and bottom. AMC is rising on their rosy picture of the theater industry and placing bets ahead of their earnings report on Monday.
WSB be like ‚Äústonk up 60% on 3 month chart? Time to buy calls‚Äù ü§°
Normally... If something goes up a big %, it will probably go down. Even something like TSLA usually drops and consolidates before taking off again. Same for drops. There is always a dead cat bounce, even if it will continue to drill. 

I make a lot of quick in and out plays on Top gainers and Losers of the day. Usually pull a quick $20-$50 gain. It's not exciting, but it passes time.
Absolute battle with Ford right now. A lot of calls in the money over 19.60
Yea October and I think SOFI itself was saying November or some articles were. Then I read the other day based on history could be anytime between now and spring. Cleaning up the books now on warrants makes sense so it's not hanging over them as they boom with student loan pause going away and bank charter and who knows what else.

Sell sell sell. This market is crazy. No one knows what happens Monday. We could open at $415 just as easily as $475
They should do it more often
Is something going on with AMC??
Out of all these movements this week, AAPL literally does nothing... I mean my calls are for 1/21/22 and bought literally on the bottom after earnings so everything is good but man, I thought this stock will move more haha
so, no news just you wanting us to buy LOL

China made a bet against MURICA and fucking lost its red Commie pants
Today? I wish, but see you later alligator
"literally" the worst? Probably dumping my life saving into calls over $160 strike expiring today would be "literally" the worst. This is WSB, $46 is nothing. Not even a tank of gas on a bet that a stock that dropped 35% may have a price jump in the next month back to  to 50% of ATH.  

Guess we will just see. I like the chances I will make a free lunch off this. 

"Literally" LOLZ
I'm sitting on a few SPY 11/12 $469c that I'm up on and I'm REAL damn nervous to hold them to next week. Figure I'll make a choice on it in the next 20 minutes or so but I need a sign.
To be fair, if profit off my mom's uterus collapse if I could, that is *very* American. But ya, get fukt GBs.

Damn I can‚Äôt believe I trusted my portfolio to the democrats ability to pass a bill. What was I thinking.

Lmao at all the people being banned today after making stupid GME banbets
lol peleton getting slaughtered

&amp;#x200B;

thinking of opening a positon with penn.. some leap calls
My $LYV boner could not get more erect. I'm gonna jizz straight lambos.
If no one wanted it, the yield would be increasing from all the selling. People are buying it which is why the yield is going down. It‚Äôs perplexing to me that yields are going down especially after fed announced tapering even though it was expected. You‚Äôd think people would want out of the bond market if the fed is saying they‚Äôre about to stop propping it up
This isn't the place for same investments..

But not, don't think day trading is that great for most
Remember, spy is just warming up for its longjump 5 minutes before close.
Hit up Tim Mango
Overvalued
Calls. It‚Äôs already down so much, worst case is it goes down more.
Instructions unclear‚Ä¶
Can you elaborate for me?
Ive been holding this for a long time now, this company has shown explosive growth within the past year. People say its just  because of chip shortages, but I think they are positioning themselves for the future.

Closed all my SPY calls. 

5k &gt; 40k over the past few weeks during this run up. 

Will reevaluate buying on a string of red days in near future. Too bad I didn‚Äôt sell around 470 - could‚Äôve snagged another 4-5k. 

This weekend I‚Äôll eat some good Italian, see 2 movies with my AMC pass, see a play, do some household chores, and whip my Cayman - all without stressing over these calls.

NFLX really dragging me down today
If theta is higher than Delta and it doesn't move then yeah the theta will cancel it out for today. Keep in mind those numbers are basically cents on a dollar of movement.
I'm gonna see what it gets priced at. Valuation currently seems really high for them only shipping 100 trucks so far.

Whale buying flow agrees with you, lots of big contract buys opened today
I see a bunch of post about buying the dip for stocks that are expensive as hell and I want to know if it‚Äôs legit. When I first got into stocks I was planning on buying a stock and selling it in the same day depending on how low it went. Is this a good way to make a couple hundred bucks a day or are you not allowed to buy when $$$$ is 45,603 and sell later in the day if it goes up to 45,765? I‚Äôm just using vague examples

Hello fellow kids
PENN calls were an obvious play yesterday.
PTON crashes based on fundamentals, and people think it‚Äôs ‚Äúcheap‚Äù lol
You're projecting  for a stock to fall because you paper handed lmaooo.
my account blew up. It was fun while it lasted
Lucky bastard
Good luck, it would be the antithesis of fomo if I jumped  in now thought, so I‚Äôll sit this one out.
Pump at open and sideways all day. Lame. 

*pokes market* 

Do something. Bar fucking PTON
*sigh* Even when I‚Äôm up, they‚Äôve got to make this shit difficult.

Fine. Guess I‚Äôll hold my MSFT 335s over the weekend. Let me know when you assholes are willing to pay me a decent price for them.
Bruh, you buy your watches on installment plan like a poor
Pass out drunk like everyday
Ford calls are cheap right now
It was indeed, not the top.

does my straddle expiring 11/12 get theta crushed intra day today with sideways movement or nah?
What date?
Dip lasted for an hour...
They not gonna hide they gonna buy more FDs and lose more money. Then they gonna glower

PTON calls are pretty cheap. Picking one up, just incase. 1 DEC 3 $83C for $46.
They felt right at $16 a share
That's probably too far out to make any money

It'd be really fucking easy to kill the bulls today.. wonder what will happen...
Sold? Pompeiiittt
Sold my spy call weeklies perfect this morning. Bagged a bunch. 

But my early afternoon puts too early for the lunch dip. 

Gave up on them too early when they didn‚Äôt start to print. Then boom. Big ass drop. 

Had 40p ebs locked and loaded this morning. Didn‚Äôt pull the trigger. Up by 10‚Äôs of thousands of percent now. 

Oh well. Still a good green day for me.
Hope you are right. Just bought 100 shares. Maybe a little sell off next week, might buy more if so.
There won‚Äôt be one, keep loading up on any red
Is it too late to buy PTON puts?

It just dropped 3 bucks.
Wut
The Rhinoceros Party in Canada ran on that platform like 20 years ago. Actually their platform was to out big tires on rear axles so all cars rolled Downhill for better fuel economy, but pretty much the same thing. 

They have also run on moving the Rocky Mountains 10 feet to the east as a work project, and selling chairs in Parliament to raise funds. They have a solid platform.
Given that the short strike is like .06 delta and the long leg reduces his risk from infinite, inwould assume very little margin. He's probably getting 1-2% ROI every 2 weeks. If he plays with ratios then probably more.

Wednesday was Fed day. That rally. üòÇ

Not happening. I am a college kid. We aren't taking tests online anymore where we have 48 hours to submit. The chegg website has to many ads as well. They know they are fucked.
tasty fucking dip i tell ya
I highly regret not buying Ford calls when it hit $19 even today. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll let it dip a bit lower first‚Äù ü§°

Interesting combo of Theta Gang PMCC play and retarded WSB lottos.

I don‚Äôt have many answers but I do know this one. Because you thought it was going lower than 428. Did I get it right?
Are leaps on CHEGG a bad idea? I get that it slowed down post pandemic, but kids are still going to cheat. I think it could move back to 40 pretty quickly.

have you tried putting it all in TSLA calls?
Why is VIX so high? Genuinely curious.
its fucking retarded. i can respect theta gang, but keep that shit away from me ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
I'm taking up a small position then. If it prints, awesome.

Are you ITM? Or like $5-10 out? I‚Äôd hold.
SAVA is the big player now IMO. Tons of buying volume, significantly cheaper than TSLA and NVDA. Had a high of $135 a few months back and if results for their Alzheimer's testing keep coming in, it could break $150 by Q2 2022
Anyone else doing nio calls for earnings?
TSLA to 1250 EOD is still possible

I think buying MRK long calls yesterday was a mistake.

Did the same thing on tuesday or wednesday I believe
I wonder what kind of major catastrophe would have to happen to tank SPY to 300 by Monday.
Some guy on Thetagang.com bough $10 December 2023 Nokia calls for between 45c and 73c, and is now selling $7 14 DTE covered calls to whittle down his cost basis by 1 cent ever two weeks. Which will whittle it down almost exactly as fast as he's losing on the long calls from theta.

I still can't tell if this is genius or stupidly inefficient. Probably depends on how his broker handles margin ratios for credit spreads.

New to investing this week. Currently have $4k split between 75% Stocks and 25% ETFs. I have a bi weekly auto buy set up for a % of each stock/etf. Currently a large chunk of this is in Tesla and NVidia. I was wondering if it‚Äôs a better (safer) option to split my money evenly between everything, and set the auto buy up evenly between them all? I know it would be less spiky gains but idk shit. 

Example: $400 in all 10 picks with a $25 auto buy every 2 weeks. 

Resources for good information welcome. Thanks!

Edit: I expected nothing less. Savages!

If you're curious, I bought PUTs on INVH (invitation homes - the company the BlackRock spun off that holds their portfolio of single family rental homes). The real estate bubble should be ending soon. The home price to income ratio which is normally pretty stable has skyrocketed over the last 2 years and is at 2008 levels. 2006-2008 was the only other time we saw a huge increase and we know how that ended. Inventory is finally starting to open up again post-pandemic and houses are starting to sit on the market. Add to that the foreclosure wave which will hit soon, and the fact that all the new home starts (which finally started to increase during the pandemic) have started hitting the market, and you have the recipe for a bursting bubble. Zillow and opendoor were the first to learn this, but INVH is going to see some major losses if housing prices start to go down.

Question, genius - where do you think the trillions of dollars go ? They just sit in bank accounts?

Nope. Consumers spend them. Companies make profits. People buy stocks. 

We have the highest savings rates in decades. 

Country is flush with cash. 

Is the dollar being devalued ? Absolutely. So where do you park it ? Cash is the wrong answer. Put it in assets that will appreciate along with inflation. Stocks being one of those. 

Don‚Äôt give me some BS about how inflation will hurt the stocks. Maybe back in the old economy. We can clearly see that‚Äôs not the case. The evidence is right in front of your eyes with the market going up up up. 

You can keep sitting on the sidelines watching your money evaporate, or you can join in on the circus and at least be able to pay for your $20 bread loaf next year.

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/kidbopper (0/1) made a bet that DKNG would go to 47.0 when it was 43.755 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
unless it‚Äôs 0dte you‚Äôre fine. i just bought a couple around 2 hours ago for 11/10, and am already up over 60%.
wow PYPL is *still* going down. wow.

basically if you bought anytime since late July you've been losing money.

it's either going to explode after earnings or crater.

a straddle might be the move, hm.
RIP.
$SAVA is finally pumping again
Spce puts before earnings ?
My 1 dte spy puts were 3.5 baggers

dont be nervous this red is because its friday. people are selling calls and shares for the weekend.
Lol fuckn bird brain
Going heavy on F calls for next week. Lfg
Tears of babes
Just do a charge back on the margin buy if the trade goes against you. Tits up
PYPL calls free money
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/TopTerrible8119 (0/2) made a bet that DKNG would go to 50.0 when it was 43.79 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
GME ima need you to pump those fucking numbers up
Ahead of earnings?
that pump this morning wasn‚Äôt the bull trap


this is the bull trap.
perhaps wait til monday to avoid a bad trip in the event of a big loss lol. besides markets almost closed, set your sights on the weekend
I bought 11/12 25C on the dip believing in the chart... ha, believing in the chart xD no but really, hoping it goes back to the 27 levels before earnings and sell before
No, infa vote tn
My plan is to bet my whole 200k robinhood account on a potential 10 banger before January first. If anyone has any plays they believe in send it to me. I'll post proof when I open the position.
That‚Äôs not weird that‚Äôs just a waste of money

We dont do memes stock round here
check out TTD boys, consistently beating earnings expectations for a long time, plus they don‚Äôt have a physical product so no constraints. I‚Äôve been bullish since my first purchase in late 2018. 

Earnings Monday, they‚Äôve been taking a beating this week after doing really well last week. I just dropped $440 on a call for next week as well as sitting on 90 shares
sooooooo we going hard in the paint of Reddit goes public? lollll
All in back on ford
SPY 471 EOD, gonna be massive buy volume into close just watch
MMs just trying to make sure everyone is awake
That shit has negative float and IV isn't even that high.. be super careful. It could very well get to 1500-2000 by Jan, even though long term they'll lose significant market share to competitors
AMD simply couldn't keep up with NVDA.
Quick someone give me a trade to turn 1k into 2k
I just wish I went in on qqq instead of spy. The dip wasn‚Äôt as harsh on those calls where I‚Äôm down 50% from 500% this week, I‚Äôm at 450% and thought I‚Äôd get a 1100 day
These are what we call "dying breaths"
My margin account approved. So is it free money I can use? I was gonna do grocery this weekend.

You can‚Äôt earn 4% back in crypto?
The future in three decades sure. Where's the rush?
Damn, good luck then.
Aye
wow u guys managed to pump spy back up .2%

Even it out with some cocaine and you‚Äôll be good as new old sport
Sold my calls this morning, had a croissant sandwich, bought some longer dated calls when spy was at like 468.30, took a shower and now I‚Äôm gonna go make some soup from scratch.

I think so too. Markets have been sleeping on this one.
imma need elon to tweet something like 'we just purchased the solar system' or somethin

Fridays are for drinking beer and buying 0dte calls on random shit. Woohoo.
Net income and revenue down from last year. Expenses also went up a bit
Nice
Been selling off my positions, good job nos means inflation is gonna get worse better to wait and see how market reacts next week than hold stocks heading over weekend.

I have cash on the sides waiting for any dip but I know everyone is waiting for a dip so the only dip that happens is profit taking, which is not really a dip.

This is not my area of expertise.
Gay bears going off this weekend so annoying
right now "see you idiots we knew it spy never runs like this"

next week when spy is at new ATH "this clown market doesnt make any sense, everythings overvalues, crash imminent"
No bc SPY would be $550
VIX up 10%?


market still green 


this is POD RACING AF
Positions or ban, bot boy!
SPY sown $3+, $4+ QQQ and counting despite no statistical or chart explanation, huge sale volume by institutional not retail, Goldman Sachs, major bank, went from a peak of $414 earlier to $407 now for a $7+ drop despite up indicators. JPM Americas largest bank, $170 to $167.

THE CRASH is coming! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! WERE'ALL GOINZG TAH DIE!!!!!! AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

Should have sold these SPY 11/12 475C this morning

Holy fuck my VIX futes are saved
SPY BOUNCE BACK PLEEAAASEEEE
The goal is to stay above the VWAP and then bounce off it.  When vwap breaks, well \*looks around\*
It broke VWAP to the bottom side. It won‚Äôt dip more for now.
And fuck everyone's puts.
Cash secured put. 

Have you ever looked at a stock and said ‚Äúman when it hits X price then I‚Äôll buy‚Äù. Well when you sell a csp at that X price someone is paying you to buy that stock when it hits that price, which you already wanna do that right? So why not squeeze extra cash out with a contract.
It doesn‚Äôt mean it was passed and that‚Äôs all that matters here. If that fucking thing isn‚Äôt past we are going to retest 460.
Bears losing momentum..
Hold up. BBBY float is 100 million - 42 million held by institutions - 18 million from buy back to be completed this year you‚Äôre left with 40 million shares remaining and 28 million of them are short.
I bought TTD puts bcuz of you don‚Äôt let me down
Played MRNA 0DTE really early today. After selling that fker for 60% loss, its now already 500% up in 30mins. Atleast Tesla put gave me 200%.

It's because PTON is trying to go up, cratering the rest of the market
&gt; The taper is the central bank's plan to reduce its balance sheet by not rolling over all of its maturing bonds. This will be done gradually, and it has been known for years that this would happen at some point. The Fed started tapering in December 2013 (link).

There will never be a crash if everyone is just sitting around waiting for a crash with cash ready to buy the drip when we crash
And what IV are you selling at where you get 2% return a week? Or is ot 2% if you get exercised?
Someone from CNBC is getting paid to read this comment : )
When people say buy the dip‚Ä¶ well. This is the dip bros. It‚Äôs a baby dip but still.
ummmmmmmm the goal is to stay above the vwap and then bounce... when you break it, well \*looks around\*
There is some weird shit happening.  I bought some calls yesterday; since then the underlying went down 5% and the option briefly spiked up 30%.  It's still up and the underlying is still down and I'm pretty sure the textbooks say that's not supposed to be how it works.

I also sold an ITM 11/19 option for less than the current stock price plus the option price.  Thinly traded, sure - but that thin?  Calls aren't supposed to be a bet on the price dropping.
It's gone down enough for me to hold my puts but not quite make them green. Now it will rocket back to a new ATH.
Super Green Day so naturally  my calls (Tesla and Target) are down and my puts (BB) are up
I bought spy calls at the top ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)

That would be a bad move politically if they did
Yields are the part that confuse me.  

If the biggest buyer of bonds (Uncle Sam) is about to buy less, then why is everyone frantically buying bonds to front run it? (causing yields to drop)

Many sources all thought the outcome of taper would surely be higher yields, so what's up?
50-100% on calls
MVRS gonna be 3T within 5 years
Zoom, NVAX, MRNA, and PTON of course.
If everyone keeps saying crash it‚Äôs gonna buy back, keep pretending to be bullish

Fundamentally, there's too much liquidity in the markets.

$AUR 

Recent de-spac yesterday, one of the only public pure play autonomous vehicle companies. $TSP is the only other I am aware of. Aurora (AUR) is the only public pure play with autonomous taxis (also compete in trucking market), TSP is only trucking. 

Major institutional investors including Morgan Stanley, Fidelity, Baillie Gifford, Sequoia, Uber, and Volvo amoung others. 

Valuation is roughly 1/10th of TSP at current market price.

It will close at 1215.  Prep your condor for flight
Seems like it was heading for support in 100s and I wasn‚Äôt even sure why I invested in the first place, thought they‚Äôd be delivering more vaccines but Pfizer‚Äôs putting them to shame.

Which one of you fuckers or maybe all of you boguht NVDA andnow that shit is dumping
Lol what a dumbass.
That's what I'm thinking
 you'd be starting a long squeeze, as you buy more and more the price would keep climbing as people sell their contracts to you
I would agree but then i saw gme flair

Nvda has more of a chance to go to 350 than gme to 250
Whyyy?
Do I want to buy into spy and crash the market hm

SeLl ThE dIp
There haven't been any flights this quarter, so their revenue is literally 0.

What do you expect?
2 hours ago the price on one of my options doubled due to IV alone, not price action.  Then it immediately started going back down slowly.  Unfortunately I missed it and didn‚Äôt get to sell, but now I‚Äôm concerned.
Seriously, folks, don't let the same 5 stocks blind you to other shit. I've just made more money than I make in a month off Zoom puts alone in 3 hours. Covid stock puts. Take it to the bank.
A shit stock is all it takes to fall
definitely a dip to buy

You guys gonna see some nasty sell offs 1 hour before market closes
Guys I just found out how the print money. I bought NVDA calls
Get fucked üß∏üß∏üß∏üß∏ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
Any guesses for NVDA closing price? If it closes over 290 that's a lot of losses on calls sold for market makers. I think it will dump to 285 before close
Do I buy some spce shares and hope for a good er
So how to I dial back the time 2 hours, when my options were still 15% greener?
Could be a juicy earnings play
Why is DKNG down so much... Missed earnings but ARP and all forward looking metrics were raised
Rated T for teen
Literally the best time to buy back into my FB calls
Can I buy as many options contracts as I want or does someone have to sell them?

For example, if I was a billionaire and wanted to buy $10m of PTON puts yesterday, could I have done it?
Think semen can burn it off?
Same.  I had one profitable meme trade in March where I bagged 8k off of 1k.  Since then I‚Äôve just lost 2k on stupid trades
100 percent going to be a dip next week, you‚Äôd have to be retarded not to see it. I‚Äôm buying puts around 330

It's not about the money!  It's about all the shit you posted along the way.
I keep losing money but I keep buying more stupid calls and puts

Oh wait it‚Äôs just the vix‚Ä¶ I knew it was breaking out lul.
Mr. Drag'n These'nuts Onyoface
SPY basically went down to fill the gap from yesterday, almost to the penny. 1 cent off
Literally this is so frustrating I knew puts were the play  on open
Reached 150% but I just threw a few hundred in there for giggles so we‚Äôll see where this goes.
it could get so much worse tho

SPY still green

NDAQ barely red


this wasn‚Äôt even a sell off lol
Should I go balls deep on NVDA FD‚Äôs? Is it going back to 310 today?

Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

I don't think we are even going to see as major a pullback as we did on September. Course, watch the SPY fall below 460 now that I've said that
Made 5k on NVDA calls yesterday and lost 5k NVDA calls today. The way she goes.
Tell her it's just a joke.
We're pulling back to at least 460 before we melt up again. Your calls are fucked.

Market goes down 0.1% and half of WSB gets wiped out lmao
If you still holding spy calls because you haven‚Äôt made enough profit you must be stupid cuz its been up every single day the past 2 weeks
I don‚Äôt think u get the significance of it retracing back this far. IMO this is a sign of a red week coming.

I picked the wrong week to start swing trading TSLA.

That is 28 bucks just this year. Too unreal. Get in while you can fuckers. Shipping congestion is not going to be resolved anytime soon. No significant new containerships come up until 2023. 2022 will most likely produce 15-20 in EPS.
I timed that SPY bounce perfectly.. but I bought put.. :(
a portion of SPY call profit from this week so I'm willing to lose it all
Thinking of holding SAVA. It's holding up remarkably well even with all the fuckery going on
what spy calls do i buy
lol at anybody who thinks we're not getting another ATH next week
Can't have shit on the Russell
Recession cancelled. Everyone log back into metaverse üôå

RKT crushed earnings. Why does it not go üöÄ 

Rocket Companies reported adjusted third-quarter revenue of $3.16 billion, beating a street consensus of $2.93 billion. Quarterly earnings of 57 cents per share beat the analyst consensus estimate of 48 cents by 18.75%.

The company exceeded the top end of its closed loan volume and margin guidance. The third quarter marked the second consecutive record purchase quarter for the company.
You ain‚Äôt black if you‚Äôre not yoloing 500C 12/31 rn

I went from mooning to declare bankruptcy in just today.

Ramen for weeks. I guess
Holy smokes, what happened to PTON?!
Zg double bottom its mispriced
See my response above.
TSLA 1250 EOD still doable? lmao rip
i seriously dont think this is a rebound lol
well obviously i'm a fucking idiot, what do you want from me
Picked up my SPY calls for Monday that I was going to snag at close already.  Let‚Äôs see if I just got trapped...may be averaging down at close instead now...
NVAX been pummeled by earnings but with all the approvals looking like they are going to come thick and fast worth a buy? What do you all think? I Just grabbed a few for a punt not sure if I should buy more.
If NVDA can't close above $300 is it time to bounce?
The premiums for ATM NVDA options for next week is bonkers.
Good idea

#Ban Bet Lost

The same reason that SPY has ripped $40 straight up without statistics or charts to explain it?
QQQ going back up.

Lmaooooo

If everyone is expecting a drop, it won't drop. That's how markets work dummies.
that's literally the exact purpose of the stock
If it's good enough for pelosi it's good enough for me. Nvda to 350
That was quick Spy dip over maybe back to 470
that was the SPY consolidating, UP WE GO
VIX send foot pics
K, what happens next?
for people who were waiting for a crash, there it was, hope you took profits.

I hear what you are saying, but the semiconductor space is fucking hard to compete in once you fall behind. It's expensive as fuck to set up a new fab, and there's no guarantee of success.

Not saying that Leaps are a bad idea, but Intel reminds me more of a company like IBM than AMD. A company that got too lazy and rested on its laurels for too long, and now is simply too bloated and slow to turn itself around.
[deleted]
BTFD............. as simple as that
Don't trust this bounce.  Huge volume on the selloff, like a 1/3 it to take it back up.
I actually did
Go ahead bulls. That was definitely all there was to the downside. This is the dip you all talk about wanting to buy so bad. Let's see it. Step right up.

Just because you get the direction doesn't mean you make money.

Edit didn‚Äôt mean to reply that haha
I'm up bigly on Zoom puts. Biggest return I've ever had at 235% so far. Puts on Covid stocks are gonna print.
"stocks dropped to levels not seen since Thursday!"

LOL
SPY make me broku
thanks bears for letting me unload those worthless 0de puts for a nice chunky profit
Yeah if you bought puts sold that crap lmao
They can hold literally years, it costs like 2% to borrow that stock

it went down and it went back up
Wrong. You can get 2% a week or 10% a month with csp on plenty of companies, then flip if exercised to a strike a notch or 2 higher and repeat with cc. Its not sexy but works.

Did RKT release earnings yet

Yes your TA BS is
spy rocket crashing into the ground
463 next weds
I‚Äôm fine with a bear day. It just seems like everything at the same time just dumped
Y‚Äôall need to learn. 

Buy the dip. Sell the peak. 

It‚Äôs not hard. Have you even seen such a crazy green spy dildo? No? Ok ride it out and take your gains. Go cash for a day. Or shares only.

Who buys calls after a week like this?

I mean I bought Intel calls but the value on those is SO deflated that they‚Äôre not even losing value on this dip haha.
I see a dead cat bounce in our future
HAHAHAHA that rebound is fucking hilarious, I can't even be mad
!banbet COIN 300 2w
Spy just bounced üòÇ
Anyone interested in the VAXX IPO?
BEARS OUT BUT SPY STILL GREEN

$480 EOY
Okay. What have you all learned today? Myself, I learned this will be the last time I do ODTE options hoping to make a quick buck. That reversal on NVDA? Yeah, I was at the top on that.
I've seen this before, it's an ape trap
tesla is an alternate reality in which no bad news can ever exist
Market is not up
My knees f*cking hurt. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm squatting right
I think it's gonna go down a little bit more. If it's really really cheap, I'll buy.
buy the peloton dip ??
Hmmm‚Ä¶ CGC December calls look interesting
SPY: Miss me with that red shit lmao
Lunch time is over! It's time to POMP EET!!
You not see the V shape?
Looks bull trappy.
And where is the bottom, good sir?
Amazing news day... sell off... bonds crashing... Time to start short positions... Incrementally increase them each week... Once vaccine mandates cause a blow off Jan 4th... it will get wild
Bers 

September: Yes üòà world is finally ending 

October:
What the hell happened to SPY? I haven‚Äôt been paying attention today
Damn where you going VIX? Time to take profits and enjoy the weekend.
Love sales
The problem with playing both sides is that you never come on top
More seller than buyers

NVDA lets go to 280! Time to slaughter those piggies
how does it work then einstein
cause everything has recently rocketed. sadly somedays are red
My man here has never seen a SPY chart before. If you have at least 10-15 days left on your calls, you'll be firmly in the green by then. It's the smooth brains playing dailys wayyyy otm because they can't drop $300+ on a itm call option with at least a couple weeks on it. Just don't play spy if you can't afford a good option.
They are the biggest fucking insider traders, it's pathetic how they can get away with it.

Pelosi sold MSFT right before it slumped 4% on earnings 2Qs ago. FUCKING fuckers.
Bullish dip
load up on calls right now for amd... here comes the come back
in this market, 20% in a month is possible
how high u think it dead cat bounces?

surely this is a red day no?
Sell or hold NVDA for earnings?
Fuck it, buying more NVDA CALLS

SCARED MONEY DON'T MAKE NO MONEY

Just a bear trap, nothing to see here
Mild profit taking, QQQ down 0.1% and everyone is freaking out lol.  

Love you guys üíó
Yeah, that is my intuition and suspicion as well. I think I'll just stick to stocks and deep ITM LEAPS---slower and less exciting but it works.
I got calls for 95 for next week man, im fuk‚Äôd üò∞üòì
I'd be rich as fuck.
Buy low (China) sell high (overpriced US index stocks). This truly doesn‚Äôt have to be difficult people. Some of us out here like actually making money and are doing it. It doesn‚Äôt get much easier than this.

If mrna opens at 240 Monday I‚Äôll cream
this is a bull trap fo sho
So BBBY shorts only have 1 day to cover?
None of the statistics or charts explain the SPY decline drop. There must be a crazy amount of sellers. (seems many other big stocks have similar patterns.)

But why?

Hmm maybe holding TSla and Spy over the weekend is a bad idea.
Just skimming a little fat off the top so they can reload for another run later this month
I'm convinced that people who just blurt out
"I'm buying puts" don't know how the market works.

That's why they all get fucked very fast.
this will look dumb af in a week
Dude we‚Äôre $.50 after zero line I don‚Äôt know how you maintain so much confidence
isnt IV pretty high? IV crush gonna get you if so
Don't get shaken out, brothers. We're in a easy monetary environment and there's no news. Hold your shares and calls.
Back to ATH by EOD
ah, the good ol fashioned friday afternoon selloff

gets me everytime
why are markets tanking?
Why is literally everything dumping

If you‚Äôre not buying this SPY dip, don‚Äôt bother showing up to 4th of July.
&gt; That's a good call.

Bears what should I buy puts on
Powell is out at fed chair hahahahah

Omg bbby fucking stop
The moose?
Was hoping for an exciting Friday
Yeah. This was just a bull trap.
11/10. Gonna hold this call til spy is 490
I ain't hear no bell??![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
ü§£ it‚Äôs already discounted. Either way, U do u. I‚Äôm personally going to consider getting in after earnings if there‚Äôs a dip to the $210-220 range
Was Karp out fucking around with the Barstool Gang? WTF PLTR.  Jesus. fucking doing something.
Are the bears gonna be prematurely blow their load like always? Or they gonna hold and pile on more?
The Pelosis sold their NVDA calls this morning and let Jerome know he can turn the printers off for a bit.
Spiked last time for Q2. Dunno about others, anyone else know?

I'm holding 27C Dec 3
On everything
Spy was up 9.5% in a month and you bought calls?
It‚Äôs about to.  Netflix rolled over last two days.  TSLA about to next week
because you touch yourself
[deleted]
SPY V shape, fucking called it
Wall Street boys just having an extra scotch after their steak, they'll be back from lunch soon and we'll moon again
Tesla loosing steam though might be selling those overpriced contracts next week
Don‚Äôt worry Jerome tripped on the printer cord, tech support is here
You're assuming it will be exercised. If it expires worthless, there's no exercise. So regardless, premium should be delivered up front. Right?
Haha my weekly spy puts always start with my big brain wanting to hedge and then it slowly develops into an extremely risky and idiotic position
I started thinking I should switch to puts, then I remembered. If I think its a good idea, the bottom must be in.
I really need to learn to take profits
BBBY contracts paid my rent for the next 3 months this afternoon.
DIE SPY DIE

Days like today make me regret sticking to my 5/10 cent rule.
I cant believe my VIX calls actually worked out. Well SPY can go up now
Nope
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Renegade2592 (0/1) made a bet that GME would go to 250.0 when it was 204.645 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
market dies but the most overvalued stock on the market, tesla, is fine.
SPY $420 EOD?
u/dannydicko is the good guy of the day
Ok. now spy can go 500, that was the last bear trap
[deleted]
VIX hit 17 and I‚Äôm buying a chicken coup
what the FUCKING FUCK I SOLD MY PUTS AT 12:35 FOR A FUKING LOSS
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?
My portfolio is blood fucking red. Rip everyone. Fuck the bears.
My NVDA 300p I bought a few hours ago are now up &gt; 50%.
I consider this financial advice and will be reporting you to the FED, Free\_Tangelo.
NOPE indicator pointing to a SPY rebound to 469.5 at least. If you banked on this dip congrats, but I wouldn't open more puts now.
Good job. I had too much ptsd to do it
I hear ya, I didn't sell OCGN Wednesday morning.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

So a friend wants to be a reference for a rental application. That's fine; but the place wants my address and I don't want to provide it. WHAT DO?

Oof this has potential to get very ugly
Fucking bears driving SAVA down
BA was at like 207 for a few days. if you didnt load up on calls , i jus dunno mang
At least some of these are LPs.  Some of that ‚Äúdividend‚Äù is return of capital.
Bear down, Chicago Bears!
People taking profit. GUH
It‚Äôs hard to want to comment with all the downvotes, but I just gotta say RRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
My VXX calls just came to LIFE
That shit gives me anxiety hahaha

Sameeee
I wonder who got fuckt holding Z
I leave for 30 min and NVDA upperdecked my shitter. Wtf
Rest In Peace üôè, pussy bulls got put to sleep
I definitely didn‚Äôt just load up on spy calls
Strong unemployment report means no more excuses to keep rate at 0. Dump this trash.
Ok MRNA and BNTX should just declare bankruptcy at this point. Fucking market
Bought calls at the top today, gonna go try to flush myself down a public toilet
Just hand me the noose
Holy shit I actually timed the top for once
Selloff to 460, load your puts
I'M BEARY EXCITED üêªüÜô
# which one of you retards bought calls at 470
As soon as I stop supporting the gays (betting on puts), I get red dicked down. Where were these results when I needed you?!
If you know you're going to be -5000 probably just sell
I have been bullied. Stop it!
I think it would be hard. You'd have to sell a ton of options with high IV (like GME) and it almost always goes your way.

What strike? I was holding dec 17th 1570 calls that I sold for just under 40x gains this week. I didn't think it would hold over 1200 this week..

Idk what u just said
Our faces change imperceptibly.  This is the dip, and we are now in its embrace
my puts printing. placed a banbet. all is good in the world
Exp date?
Is the pandemic over or why is mrna so shit? Honestly looks too cheap rn
Go check the tape... I warned ya'll yesterday about a sell off coming... Precious metals started moving and bonds dying.
If you‚Äôre cool with slow and steady, you‚Äôll double your holdings every year if done correctly (and a lot of attention, can‚Äôt set and forget). I wheel BB and TELL and up 140% trailing 12 months. Not WSB style but works.

AMD and NVIDIA can go back up now, k thanks
It made its short term tank on increased margins. It‚Äôs in its rebuilding phase rn. This is its bottom imo
I was a bull, sold at 470 and bought back in with puts lololol
Spy just died I guess?
Never trust this fucking market. You see profits, take it and run. Run very fast and far away
We‚Äôre about to go red my man. This doesn‚Äôt look good.
Happened ages ago. Right around the time people started bagholding CLOV
Profit taking starts now?
Call options go booom lol
Like I promised earlier... SPY to 467 and I'll never buy puts again!!! üòç

Shout out to the retards that fomoed into NVDA calls when it was above $300. Buying the top true WSB style.
Glad we‚Äôre taking a breather. Means more run to moon

I bought a little late but I'm up 25% in 10 minutes
How cool would it be to be able to tell your kids "I bought SPY puts at the moment it touched it's intraday high... Now shutup and go clean out the bunker's shitter before we suffocate from that smell"...

Opened poots again.
-$21k so far and dropping like a stone
Despite this wild .5% drop... SPY is still overbought on every timeline out to 20 days.
  
November would have to be as brutal as October was favorable to bring RSIs down to neutral.
Any chance of TSLA going back to 1000$ by 2 weeks ?
What am I supposed to be looking at. I don‚Äôt understand volume indicators
Why NVDA be doing dat tho?
I can still reload my ready to blow up account twice, so I don't mind. Plus gotta hedge my long positions somehow
I‚Äôm back and my VIX calls are printing! Give me the Friday feeling you volatile slut !!
Same af, infinity ward is the best, but I still can‚Äôt pass up new cods
What does a red candle with a short body and a long wick on top mean?

That is a good feeling.

a lot of bulls gonna be sick soon
When I was a little motherfucker playing Super Nintendo I felt cutting edge. Now my kids are gonna ride hypersonic missiles to space force camp in the metaverse.
I don't buy puts because my investing philosophy is not on betting that stocks go down... Not my style and definitely not in a fucking bull market. I'm here to make fucking money by using the fundamentals of options trading to my advantage. 

Yes. you're not a good trader ... Maybe when I'm less tired and can type, I'll elaborate.
Feeling so good about my gains I think I might just jack off twice today.
Damn, c'mon TSM. Go up like NVDA, even just a little.
Isnt the name of the game to buy LOW? I‚Äôm personally going to see if it fills the gap down to $220
i wish i could wipe out an entire weeks worth of trades.....
Nasdaq just won't go red.  Does it tank if it goes negative on the day or bounce like it's taking a fresh hit.

Got a call at the top of spy today, got a put shortly after and they pretty much evened out, now I sold the put and am holding call, down about $7 today overall lol

Astonishing to think about the amount of puts that have been wiped off the face of the earth this week.

Out of Lucid the peak now I‚Äôm cash and sitting on my hands. Telling myself ‚ÄúI will not catch a falling knife‚Äù repeatedly
Anyone have any MRNA put porn? Balls if you held them through yesterday and didn't sell. Huge gains. I just bought calls but not expecting much.

Sweet Jesus can we get a SPY bounce here
I think we see another healthy pull back, but it *should* be a pretty deep dip. Key word being should. The market is fucking nuts so who knows what'll happen.
Already priced in. Just look at the 1 week
Too bad I like my roku tv. Way more responsive than fire tv.
‚Äúi don‚Äôt buy Puts‚Äù

AMC is going to $100+ next week lol, sorry guys. It‚Äôs going to happen
Feel like a grown up buying a Kitchen Aid Pro 6 quart mixer
So this is what Great Grandpa felt like that day in 1929
Almost sold csp on AMD this morning, shoulda bought them instead
I'm so closed to 6 figures (currently $97,000: 77k equity, 20k cash). It's chump change compared to other accounts here but I'm quite proud of it. 

I took the boring route to get here: stock and LEAPS. If there is a correction or major dip, I'll get deep ITM QQQ 2024 LEAPS and just delete RH and check back again in a year. 

Boring and slow but it works. I hope to hit $100,000 before year end üòä
Every single comment being mass downvoted except the few retards that are saying buy calls on so-called guaranteed melt-up from here lmao.
Next move probably heart breaking, ima hold onto my puts over the weekend as planned.
My damn near worthless spy puts expiring today ended up being a decent hedge for my poorly timed spy calls. So basically my retarded trade partially saved my other retarded tradeüòÇ smh
Puts on spy for the next 3 years
Not happening
You were supposed to do that at 310
Half the time I get instant settlement and half the time I have to wait a week

That is 28 bucks just this year. Too unreal. Get in while you can fuckers. Shipping congestion is not going to be resolved anytime soon. No significant new containerships come up until 2023. 2022 will most likely produce 15-20 in EPS.

OK dump over, pomp eeit

That first one might get you banned. 1b market cap or greater only.
TLRY is the worst stock in the world, its official
&gt; The Roku IPO was a disaster. The company had to reduce the price of its shares and sell less than expected in order to complete their offering.
Looking forward to watch those calls expire worthless :)

The one day i fucking leverage hard into IWM calls and it shits the bed. What the actual fuck
Nope that was an algo run up. It doesn‚Äôt last long

Wow rug pull?
Buy the dip on Merck or nah?
Pfizer pill has a way bigger effect on the market than their shitty ER
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, a dump

I've been waiting for this moment for three whole weeks, let's dump
stop being so worried about amd... the market is going  red today. when it goes green amd outpreforms market.... just relax
Nice entry. I got in around 745am when I saw QQQJ tank while spy stayed green. 

Knew it might follow later. Got lucky ü•≥
If anyone likes stocks that have a good deal of growth left to get back to pre pandemic levels, that also are paying fat dividends at the same time‚Ä¶ Here‚Äôs a few I really like.

Basically, while the stocks are growing substantially back to normal levels, they also pay you nice checks in the process to protect you.

PBFX - PBF Logistics pays an 8.83% dividend and has a good 80% to appreciate still with great momentum

PBA - Pembina Pipeline pays a 6.2% dividend while having a 50% runway to get to current price targets of around 48$

RWT - Redwood Trust pays a 6.25% dividend while having about a 50% gap to pre pandemic levels

CIM - Chimera pays a 8.07% dividend while having about 45% to run back to pre pandemic levels

EPR Properties - owns Top Golf and pays a 6% dividend while having a 70% runway to pre pandemic levels. 


Good luck out there ladies and gentlemen
Bahahaha ok buddy
If Elon dies tomorrow $TSLA will go down 80% in a day
if you bought puts and the stock is dropping your position is probably up right? for a 0dte i wouldnt worry about maximizing profits as long as you‚Äôre making money i would just sell those when you‚Äôre satisfied
The *crash* looks significantly smaller on the 1wk and 1 month charts
Wow... they absolutely tanked MQ this week.

Going for Max Pain!
crash over, return to regularly scheduled pumping
MRNA ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Low volume on TSLA
Based on NVDA‚Äôs 5day chart, it looks like it should rebound past $313, but who fucking knows anymore.
[deleted]
Exactly. Everyone will sell then load up again. Market is broken if you havent noticed. Full melt up mode
Phizer still not tracking with the SPY gains. Means it‚Äôs got room to run while waiting for this new drug approval. Game changer. Now all those anti-vax might stand a chance of living. 

They‚Äôre gonna eat this drug up.
Whoever invested in ipad-bike thinking they would make money, deserves to lose it all
It's bear season again. Here we go
All this crying with SPY +0.27% and QQQ +0.05%. Imagine what's going to happen on Monday LOOOL
Is the fever finally breaking?
Same
Rent the runway a steallll at these prices. Hedging cocks
I got an email from Affirm today encouraging me to finance a Peleton bike lol.
I hope so. My rent depends on it
I hope your calls aren't 0dte
Amd gotta chill jesus
I hate Merrill Edge so much
You bought at insane IV levels?
can it just go red finally? 


like this is cool and all. i will take what i can get.

but a red day? on impressive job numbers?

that would be so SPY of SPY
Just can‚Äôt add more, it‚Äôs too big a position for my portfolio
Buy BA
Midday NVDA thoughts?
Exactly what I did. Exited a QCOM position, opened a FB position.

God forbid wanting *money* during *the weekend* why would anyone ever close anything according to these people
Yes trust me
Airlines and travel related are the new play LFG $UAL, $DAL, $UBER!
BABA on its way back to the gutter, who would‚Äôve known!
SPY gonna close -$0.01 just so news outlets can report a win streak snap and reset the green day streak
Its an EVERYTHING RALLY. even the VIX is up.
$1240-$1244 resistance zone payout puts nicely
The only ticker that has gained value in the past 30 mins is fucking PTON‚Ä¶. What the fuck
So no Black Friday ?
Any weed stock gang here?
Profit taking. Totally healthy.
I sold my calls too.
SPY bebi wat is u doin
Don‚Äôt look at it anymore ü•∂ü•∂ü•∂ lol
Only the paperest of hands would sell Nvidia and AMD right now
You haven‚Äôt met me
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Let's just call it a day.  

I've got a bad feeling about power hour.
And here i thought the only big dump i would see today is the one i took before my shower.
I mean it ran up 40% on a 4% Er beat the last month what else do u want lol. It should be in the 110s-120s
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Where is your God now, bulls? Send me your downvotes. I bathe in your tears...


until the gap up overnight.
Yup Nancy loading up here
We get it, you have *stank* dick
NVDA having a higher market cap than TSM is honestly wild
Bought nvda
Entire market crashing. Omfg. What do I do
Jumped back into DWAC.
It's a slow bleed so it's nearly impossible to gain on puts without making it a full time job.
Sold my AMAT calls up 130% please dip so I can rebuy
keep buying the dip on moderna guys
Go up, not down.
Please tell me bbby is still squeezing
Because *what if 200%‚Ä¶*
*BUY THE DIP* you've been warned
whoever asked for the dip, hurry up and buy it, depression is setting in
If we could gap fill 455 spy today that would be fantastic... A stupid fantasy, but a boy can dream.
AMD IS DROPPING HARD...... bought more shares
Lol have a look at the Nasdaq
I don't buy puts. I go cash gang when I'm bearish because the taste of IV crush is not for my palates.
Highest spy strike is $685, I'm just waiting for $690 lol
I‚Äôm going to laugh if FB just pops when the ticker symbol changes
Considering the demographic probably.
Figures???
&gt;   Lol
Went from +7000 to +2000 today. Should I sell and take 2000 or wait till end of day and be -5000?
This is beyond frustrating
SPY RSI JUST starting to drop on the monthly... looks like room for a LOT more blood.. probably means it's going to run until the end of today..
My portfolio is red af. Thanks, Obama.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
No way. Everyone gonna take profits. Nobody up 1000% on calls gonna hold over weekend.
boys will we see BBBY surge eod or is this bearish for the day?
80% for me but I bought this morning after selling  my calls
lol PFE calls hurting rn...
Was so mad that I sold NVDA, NET, and SQ before close yesterday when they were all up this morning. Almost jumped back in, but didn't. 

Am I...learning? (the answer is no)
Been thinking about grabbing some of those tbh
#[RATS](https://streamable.com/diqtwi)
Alright if Nvidia drops about 40-60% more its fair valued
Why wouldnt it.  Its up alot this week.  Was obvious there was gonna be people taking profits.
Amd really?

Thank you ber jesus for saving me
If I had anymore dry powder I'd be buying the shit out of this nvda dip
Oh fuck you
Come on Disney pull up!
DIE TSLA DIE THE BEARS WILL FEAST ON YOUR CARCASS
especially after everything blowing up in 2 days.

i took profit during the bull rush and the part thats staying in my account is currently picking up discount calls
Should I hold onto 471C 11/10?

SPY about to V shape
QQQ ouch gave it all back Spy getting there should see red
stop being a bitch and buy
AMD 140c EOD.  Get rich with me guys.
GOOG calls in shambles
The little nvda that could
Ah OK, makes much more sense lol. Haven't heard about that, I'll look into it. Thanks!
just that 100% gain in a few months
Naked
Never go balls deep
Love it... Was selling MRNA in the 400s now buying back. Overdone.
Pulling into my local GameStop to buy new COD. Parking lot is full. Bullish
Fuck spy and tsla come pick me up gme !
Red by close.
how can you even lose money on nvda
Cleared all my positions at 11:30 and feel really fucking good about it.
Sold at the top üòé
Rich are probably playing a game called take poor peoples money. The rich pumped the rally now their taking it too far and now people are still investing when there is supposed to be a crash. This is not normal with the events going on earth.
SPY puts up 60% already üòà GIMME
Alright bears better sell your puts. EOD pump incoming
Pfizer sure does have some geniuses working for them. Quickest to the vaccine and now a miracle drug. Calls on PFE! Should be 90/share! PE is only 20 right now and many ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù companies have theirs at 50+ so that shouldn‚Äôt be a problem for a company in a sense saving the world
It‚Äôs over boys, 1929 + Great Recession is starting
Dear QQQ,

Don't you fucking dare.

-Dean
Lol ok dude there needs to be a pull back to reload 

VIX telling you they loading up Puts if your calls long dated you good
Yuhhhh
Buying amc
Should have emptied out all of my spy calls instead of just half.
Shorting NVDA is like taking fentanyl that you bought from a shady dealer
Me too, sold in the morning with a nice 168% gain.  Once I‚Äôm up like that I‚Äôm out
So funny that people here are like VIX IS CREEPING SPY PUTS and that the inverse is true. If that were the case, every single one of you would be rich as fuck and wouldn‚Äôt be shitposting on here. 

Or maybe everyone shitposting is rich as fuck and I just don‚Äôt see it.
It‚Äôs going to be the last hour it gets ugly
Bears eat while you can because we don‚Äôt want to hear the crying next week.
I just cut my PLTR &amp; DKNG bags, sticking with companies that make money
Lmao dudes never heard of taking profit
You do you boo
if u not buying puts, idk what u doin
UVXY 17 EOD or bust
When you knew ZM puts were the move yesterday but you just bought Tesla calls like always ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
I don't know who but SOMEONE is splitting their stock next week.

and I will be going all in on monthly FDs
and I sold my puts 30 minutes early for a loss instead of 100% gain. AMA
amd and xilinx
What did I tell y'all? Beware the VIX
fuck you NVDA
Expect SPY bounce after that dip..
Is spy done bleeding out yet üò™
Tech almost red. What a rug pull.
Get in on MRNA puts while you still can
Well I‚Äôm down 50 percent on calls I bought today, and it keeps going down.
No chance NVDA closes red
ABNB calls for next week, let‚Äôs go!
Yup
Merger between AMD and NVDA?
lol makes sense that on the day i buy it we sell off
&gt;panicking during a friday dip

sheesh
&gt; AMC is a stock that will go down in history as the worst hedge fund ever.
$ETON is looking promising for calls. It‚Äôs got the FDA approval tomorrow and earning to be released within the next week
It‚Äôll be back up by Monday, don‚Äôt worry. Panic selling gets you no where
Maybe spy $475c 1dte
Are people who bought tsla at 1240 really crying?
Damn you Pfizer. Killing your own vaccine partner
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Close out your margin... you've been warned.
Hey AMC did better than I thought and I sold a 38 dollar call against my shares expiring today. Can we make it dip a bit before the end of the day so I can keep my shares? Thanks in advance
stay the fuck out of amd and nvda for a lil if you value your cash. it‚Äôs gonna dip a little more before it rises
Sold my SQ calls this morning - never doubt the vibe
üòÇ I hope so too
Sell today.

For your own sake.
Get a job and save money, or don't make stupid investments to get rich quick. Most people here aren't using their entire life savings to get rich quick, mostly just fun accounts with gains made from smarter investments.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)ZM and SPY puts got me green for the day
Where my theta gang at? Smol pp gains
Was down 700% on this INTC call that I sold. Now I‚Äôm back in the green. Basically what I‚Äôm saying is theta gang always wins
Thats some GUH shit on NVDA right now lol
Hello Theta my old friend

Come to fuck with my calls again
Spy crashing?
My 60/40 SPY and leveraged bond ETF is way outperforming SPY. Bad sign?

the good ol friday consolidation, monday we fuck, fuk u bears
Hey you drunks‚Ä¶ ever heard of someone blowing a .34? What‚Äôs like?
makin' all the wrong moves today.  Shoulda cashed out my PFE calls this morning.
Time to move on from vaccines to therapeutics. MRNA and NVAX getting whacked
What happened to that dude that went deep on 11/5 GME 250s?
Del mar, race 6, $50 to win on horse 6

Done. See you in a few hours
SPY
no, in my experience its usually up 3%+ every day, so seeing it not up by that amount is not normal
PayPal calls. Look at it gentleman. We will be fine dining next week.
See you next week
Just raw at this point
we are stagnating
You don‚Äôt CARE about meme stocks jfc. You get in and out.
Rodgers on McAffe is electric right now
Why do I look at 100% unrealized gains like it‚Äôs not enough?
WRONG...... WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT NEXT WEEK BRINGS
Banbet or get out.
My 2 moves for early next week: 

Large position in KVSB ticker change to KIND on Monday. (Nextdoor) earnings report 11/10

Position in OPAD for 11/9 earnings. 

Good luck everyone, make some mulah
Think we'll get another SPY EOD rip up?
Except if you get Zaxby's, you did wrong by yourself by not doing Chick-fil-A.   Those waffle fries though
That was your dip boys. Close out intraday puts.
Is all good they will pay nxt week üòà
Amd and Nvda come on :(:(
Ah‚Ä¶.. that‚Äôs a lot of sell volume on NVDA
Yet here you are
Call stack, ball sack, same thing
I‚Äôm so sick of some of my positions. BABA, VIAC, RKT, SLB, DISCA
Rude
Ford looking to make a strong run EOD before Rivian IPO next week

I made fun of my dad for playing the lottery his entire life
&gt;Up 100% YTD doing zero market research or financial analysis

this is the way

my DD consists of seeing a green line up and buying based off that
Bro I'm sorry but I'm honestly not sure lol. I just buy calls and never puts. You should paste this in the discussion, I'm sure someone will reply with an answer. Good luck!
Lots have been there, done that earlier this year.
0dte mRNA puts better late than never
Nvda max pain in upper 290's, still going to hold calls into next week as this just needs a breather. Will revise if AMD keeps cratering, though
Discovery (DISCK if you are playing shares since it's the cheapest) , don't say no one on WSB told you when it goes to the 30's+.
I will just focus on myself. Bye bye sub. I don‚Äôt think I was made to make money here no matter what. I hope you all lose what you made this week tho. Fuk

Always a rollercoaster
Today is literally one of those days you sell shit that‚Äôs up high like Tesla and nvda and buy stuff that‚Äôs in a dip like baba, Nio, PayPal, crsp etc etc. for every stock that‚Äôs up stupid high there‚Äôs a stock that‚Äôs super low. There‚Äôs a rotation incoming make sure you‚Äôre on the right side of the movement. You have been warned
To be fair, you can‚Äôt go wrong with either.
In my experience flat usually means you‚Äôll either be rich or in debt by EOD
NVDA is for paper handed bitches.

You gotta make your decision so quickly. If you hear about it here as a top post, it‚Äôs too late.

Abnb up peloton down. Better get your booster /s üòÇ
How‚Äôs your worthless puts taste

Why does no one on this sub seem to care about BBBY?
Riding my 477c through expiry next Friday, or midweek sell if we get a Shrek dildo M-Tu. Then rolling all that into 12/31 SPY 500c
Have fun‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt forget to lube.
I really don‚Äôt give a shit what happens today. For a change I have nothing expiring til 11/19.
Hows that Fed dick taste?
And then comes bouncing back Monday morning?
That‚Äôs assuming the breaks even work...
I scalped 10% on nerdwallet yesterday in 10 min

Sometimes it works out
What if Elon Musk is Neo.........
Ford has been trending up EOD last week or so
sporting goods store is squeezing again....
Race six bet six.
No, that‚Äôs definitely true.
is this normal for tesla? i have calls, never traded it before
ToS don't make me out to be the bad guy. I mean who hasn't gotten a couple good faith violations on a day like today?
If snap gets to 56 I will shit myself. It will not tho. It‚Äôs just teasing my worthless call stack
Word on the street is that trucking and anyone working outside is getting an exemption from the vaccine mandate.
Baba doing the reach around to new lows. Nice.
Anyone have thoughts on SQSP - now a good buy?
800p
Cutting my weedstocks losses and buying TSLA was the best decision.
and could have been a big loss! If a frog had wings, it wouldn't bump its ass every time it hopped!

Fuck man I should have sold AMD yesterday
Shit, if this is considered TA I need a new job!
I‚Äôm heavy on Dec 6th $480c atm.  Bought them a few days ago though so they‚Äôre already up big.  Going to hold at least until next week in case infrastructure bill happens, but probably selling before too long...

My balls are aching
I had to average down 4 times since I miss timed the top but Jesus my puts were at .60 at one point currently at 3 bucks :( oh well I sold at 1.50
I think it tried to dump this morning but there were too many buyers at 1210. Doesn‚Äôt seem likely. It‚Äôs got the retard strength rn.
Guys!!!! Earnings matter!!!!! $PTON to $50!!!!! $CHGG to $30!!!!! $PENN to $60!!!!! $ZG to $65!!!!! but $TSLA to 1.5 TRILLION MARKET CAP!!!!!OMGEVS!!!!!!
I'm not sure I ever want to sell TSLA. In 2030 it'll be $10 Trillion.
PTON
BYND was starting to make a run - WTF?
Man they really don‚Äôt want to payout those NVDA weeklies lmao
The market always dumps Friday afternoon. This shit is getting so predictable.
SPY doesn‚Äôt care
Yes but after earnings
Stonks are the only reason us peasants here haven‚Äôt revolted; Fugazi forever!
Feeling cute, might buy more TSLA puts ü•∞
Well I do like candy....and I also like being raped and murdered.  OK I'm in!
PTON, I feel like it built itself into a brand name for rich people, that's what I like about it. ZM, teleconferencing will stay, even without a pandemic. Those would be my counterpoints to your points
LMAOO Tesla calls are no joke
FB
Chick-fil-A is better
You trade on a vita?  Cool story
You right, I do need to stop being a bitch

Banbet it if you‚Äôre that confident
New to trading options. It expired soon and I only had bout $100 in. I‚Äôll learn for next time

It‚Äôs not close to expiration, but it‚Äôs a holiday stock, just confirmed large increase in IV.
seems good enough to me to buy puts
Yellow
Fed can taper all it wants. Stonks will continue to rally for years to come.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
think it does tbh. i‚Äôm a bull but market frothy and people want lambo money
Average down pussy.
Yes
Not on the genZ indicator
NVAX CSPs ITM. I have mixed feelings about this. I wouldn't mind getting assigned but also wary of PFE's pill form COVID vax. Hopefully if I do get assigned, NVAX will rebound hard next week.
Gonna have to moon harder if these UVXY calls gon print, this is more like a DoD anti-missile interceptor
Why would you buy puts after SPY has gone basically vertical? That's crazy. SPY 500
I sold, don't spaz on my account but I swapped my calls for puts in the short term, I think 500 is reasonable by years end maybe but I'm not betting on it
rip NKLA rally 11/4/21 - 11/5/21
Sounds good guy
So why us VIX rising? Am I missing something?
You need them diamond hands
I‚Äôm such a pussy was balls deeps on Tesla daily‚Äôs(puts) lmao  could have cashed out way more on this nose dive Jesus
Closed long spx spreads. From +55k to +34k. That‚Äôs some bull. Open some spy 469 poots

Made $7200 on nvidia today, sold, rebought 6k at the 300 dip lmao
SPY 11/12 477c still holding strong. We will see 480 by end of next week. 500 eoy. Daddy J said stonks only go up.
Stfu
I still don‚Äôt understand those terms‚Ä¶ if it‚Äôs overbought then that means it‚Äôs likely to be sold so the price would go down?
how do people ever lose money? $STOCK is ripping
Keep lying to an anonymous stranger online, that will get the money you lost on MMAT back for sure
If Spy hits 465 going treat myself to Wendy‚Äôs
Yep need it over 12 eod
ASTS
Are apples supposed to be red or green ?
0dte spy puts or average down on calls
Weed stocks are garbage trash AIDS
Bul 4 Prison
I have a feeling we will see profit takers on SPY by EOD
I can see Roku, auto, Apple pre-pandemic and others. They were valuable then so they make sense. 

PTON, Zoom, etc‚Ä¶they existed due the pandemic. No intrinsic value otherwise. Stationary bikes and web conference apps? Whatever.
AND IT BEGINS
im gonna buy zaxbys today, the good stuff

Go ahead Spy, take a breather. Best save your energy for next week
TSLA dump commencing
Lol
i think it‚Äôs very interesting that us bears take a lot of shit

Probably buying MRNA dip?  Or perhaps she bought two days ago and sold today.
PTON doesn't even need to go down on me, it's already there
Fuck it I'm in. Which race number is it?

Who else thinks we go straight back up? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
So bullish it‚Äôs bearish
Fuck you‚Äôre right I‚Äôm all in think I should sell?
I sold during huge spike but it was only shares. So it was a 5 bagger which is not worth posting. I even hit a 30 bagger on TTWO calls two weeks ago and didn‚Äôt post pictures. Lmao. Don‚Äôt get attached to your stocks, it‚Äôs silly

According to the options market there‚Äôs less than a 0.005% chance that will happen.

Should've waited, no doubt there's another dip before the moap
just bought VTI leaps exp 2024 with a strike price of 235 and a break even with 269.....wanted to play safe for a while and immediately got bored with myself.....just need more beer i guess
Bonds crashed since Fed announcement... Odds are HUGE... I don't think these degenerates understand the fundamental melt downs occurring
Huge overreaction on MRK today. Little has changed in terms of expected 2021 and 2022 revenue for molnupiravir. They are also a strong buy based on how well their other products are performing and their M&amp;A activity. Buying opportunity.
Every time I feel like that I get royally fucked
&gt; CMPS is a very good stock. I recommend buying it now.
Ahh, NKLA back in the dumpster where it belongs.

It‚Äôs almost as if spending 20% of your remaining cash on SEC violations wasn‚Äôt a bullish sign after all...

They don't have much potential for growth- nobody gives a fuck about a bike anymore. It was always bound to be a passing craze.
Look at CMPS 1 month chart. Should I buy now? I've been waiting for a pull back but it keeps going up and up
Fuk you SQ. You ruined my gains
If I see another post about spy‚Äôs rsi I‚Äôm going to slap you. Imagine doing TA on a major index and using rsi as an indicator ü§°
First day my brokerage account passed $100k. I've been thinking there's no way this rally keeps going since SPY 400, yet here we are. When we dipped during the Evergrande fears, I thought selling 490 Dec calls would be free money. No, this market literally only goes up.

Good ol classic pump before the merger and dump in on retailers, why havent you ss proofed of your gains,looking at your posts you bought into the hype of the merger and were bagholding afterü§£ü§£
Turns out I wasn‚Äôt smart after all and was just relying on global trends this entire time.
Just go nuts for 30 minutes GME then you can do whatever the fuck your want
Exactly it‚Äôs it was doing great before now it retarded which kinda sucks
I'd also like some advice from mature apes
You get used to it. Just don't get too greedy and don't always diamond hand
Every single good play I've made this year I sold for modest gains right before a nice fat jump... Now I'm just staring at my vlta twitching trying to decide if I'm retarded for not dumping on a 25% gain.
Getting murdered today.
What‚Äôs a cheap shit that I can get a covered call on
Here‚Äôs a video from someone smarter than me. I think it‚Äôs worth noting that while I just used big words I really don‚Äôt understand markets that well, and am mostly regurgitating what other people say.

So doesnt that make a good time to buy?
elon has to be so tempted to split tsla
Imagine if you would have stuck with those F calls from a few months ago instead of switching to puts.
AUPH and running.
Surely this has to be the bottom for MRNA
Did the same with January spy 500c. Market on easy mode again.
Congrats! I realized 3k, broke college student is just a little less broke now
Something tells me SPY is due for a dip. Or a bump. Or trading sideways. It for sure won't go backward though
Don‚Äôt have a horse in this race myself! Best of luck to you. When you hit 21 check out the physical casinos. They are pretty fun also.

I just want NVDA to have sustainable growth. The faster something runs, the harder it stops. 
If I sell now, and then take those gains back into NVDA and it fucking collapses, I‚Äôll just get the noose ready now.
Sounds like you figured it out already then!
i hope my 11/12 get a nice boost during the event next week
Where do you see rsi for all these periods?
why didnt i think about buying puts instead of selling put credit spreads on moderna
How epic would it be if the market crashed this afternoon... No infrastructure bill and no more money printing..
Love the thought process
Realized 52.37K - I am out. ‚úåüèº

Well, congrats to anyone with enough balls to pickup nvda 0dte 300p‚Äôs. My 0dte calls are worthless now.
Invest 500/m every month in an S&amp;P fund, and by the time your 60 you should have well over $1M. Enough to retire comfortably, especially considering you should get more income and be able to invest more.

SPY is going to do some wild shit in the next few weeks.
Looks like someone on the street forgot to log out of their terminals and to the interns try to play with fake money. Guh.
Also, your immune system if you took that devil's brew

Get your puts get your red hot puts on sale .
Power Hour will fix it yeaah
Here comes the Friday profit taking....its all going red!!!!
Well I'll be damned, you're promoted to general stupid
BBBY fuckin nuts man, and I don't even mean to shill memes and pumps
tfw you should have sold those nvda calls before you went and had breakfast and took a shower to come back to -1000$ profit.
I'm long but I'm tempted to get a few puts
Im in ITM calls so i cant get IV crushed too much, i would probably sell on the next pop if i was in a riskier play
BB and AMC today üéØüíØ
Lol I missed out on about a grand cause I over slept
Odds my 465 puts I held are gonna make it to the money today
More like gaping
I‚Äôm talking about 12/10 475 calls. I‚Äôm not that   retarted to have them for today
SPY calls on sale.
People called me crazy when I bought calls at SPY $460, turned out as a massive printing operation, daddy JPOW keep it going ü•∫
No I expect instant gratification on everything
This coming from a 1 year old account‚Ä¶
Nov 12 $TTD 65p
DISCA bull run , I bought Jan23 leaps on 10/27 and it's up 30%
Nvidia 350c 1/22  a good move rn?
Maybe bulls who have 0dte...still way up today.
Keep up the good work
RIP MRNA and my portfolio and life savings
calls for next week? Looks like ascending support on the 1 month chart, maybe it pushes to $27 level before ER, sell profit there or hold on for ER results and see it go ballistic one way or the other LOL

Lol I‚Äôm so bad at this
[deleted]
Yes
We see nvda 320 today
Even my 471s are dying :(
new to options. I think i fucked up. lol I did 320 put for nvda expiring today. Did I fuck up? I paid $1600 premium and my assumption was as long as its 320 or under im good and I can profit of the shares. So if its selling for 300 end of day I make 20 per share minus my premium?
Pton killing kids and portfolio‚Äôs
No top yet chill
Definitely. Very healthy company, strong market, great fundamentals.
You know the drill. Good jobs report = spy dip
These SPY dips aren't doing shit to the Monthly or 3Month RSI... Be careful..

Jumped out of WYNN and BMY. Got into DKNG and ATVI 

LETS GOOOOOOOO
ZM is a sub $100 stock bruh
Cry more, ape.  Half the companies posted on here lose money.  Doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt make me money.
Looks like 8:47 was Pacific Timezone.  Old lady in the Truck stop bathroom was right.
Its vax has been halted in a few nations for under 30 yos, so that didn‚Äôt help
Their entire business has been called into question. Steer clear completely
Good call. Also probably eat less quiche.
Down 60% on my zoom calls
Would you buy a 5k treadmill with an ipad attached?
Imo sentiment has completely shifted. Might be dead money bro.
Elon is working on the Tesla bot to replace humanity so close enough
Pete‚Äôs Boeing calls expire December 17 just in case anyone is wondering
Morning ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
BBBY starting to run. Are meme stocks back on the menu. Bought some BB contracts just in case
You're still better off than 98% of the world.
Tsla too undervalue imo
Better than using a day trade to low 500!
Bought a leap and a 6 
Month out call
spy needs to cool off for a bit
[deleted]
Same!  Waiting until EOD to go heavy into Monday calls.
Ohhhh you meant their quarterly loss report
I'd be so happy
There is still hope for my SPY 475 banbet, rally in the last few hours of the day. And my 475calls will print
$50 where should it go right now?
All it's doing is making rich autists.

it‚Äôs beautiful
Couple hundo walking away from the week happy
1. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with living with parents, you‚Äôve literally eliminated housing costs which is like 40% of expenses.
2. ‚ÄúGaining weight‚Äù.... okay, eat healthier and start working out.
Head up
I'm doing something retarded listening to someone on reddit, but I feel a strange trust for you, also I already took out 2x my initial investment so I'm really just gambling with the joules money
PLTR why the hell.you down on a day like today?
No idea. Chart just looks ready to reach for ATH again and all kinds of news buzzing about meta and what it will be.
MRNA why you hate me
Finally the trash covid stocks are going down to their actual value
&gt; I think it will sink further.
got wiped out when it fell
You can always get a job and pursue career growth, and not gamble like a degenerate. Poker? Really?
Can‚Äôt lose all your options value on theta if you lose it all playing spy daily‚Äôs instead![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Of course I bought the top on bbby
MNDY puts yay or nay?
Should i buy pton shares now or do we think it‚Äôll sink further?
F better bust that nut
https://ibb.co/7G4r2Jt

Where‚Äôs the 7k ish open interest?! (Numbers changed since when I wrote it)
If spy somehow closes red I‚Äôm getting jack to the tits in calls at close
I know this.
[deleted]
Mr PTON I don't feel so good
I‚Äôll buy puts then when options come out
If it goes up after you buy no, if it goes down yes, i think it will go up so i dont think your retarded
AMC, LCID, PFEüí¶üí¶üí¶
When you do it for a living you really aren't doing it. You are calculating on a computer and as long as a tre d line for your algos don't fuck up you don't actually do anything. Its kind of nice.
Haters lol... just trying to make a quick buck...
Bro, you may want to try a GA meeting. That‚Äôs a lot of quiche to go through.
At this valuation, TSLA should also be producing self functioning humans.
Most underrated commented I‚Äôve read in a while lol
HIMX going pass 12 would cause a gamma squeeze, tons of options at 12
Not holding any positions in MRNA, but how the hell does this company go from almost $500 to 200 in less than 5 months , wtf
More ways than one
I'm working bro, and I'm all good, going to a big game tomorrow. Gonna go shoot Sunday. I'm happy camper.
NVDA wrong direction *grrr*
SPY taking a hot steamy dump on bulls
If this works I love you boys
What's going on with peloton? Is now a good time to buy calls?
Just utilized a day trade to swing Tesla for $500 in like 6 mins lol I need to delete this app
Yo what's happening, just bought calls.
Alright Peloton. I could abide the child murder feature on the product but this is just too much.
Congrats, that‚Äôs like a wendy‚Äôs managers salary every year. Without having to work at wendy‚Äôs
Must be nice. I'm probably going to get a a raise from $12k to $14k. Fucking hate Mexico üá≤üáΩüåÆ

man thought we‚Äôd see a small bounce at least on pton but we just slowly drilling further
uvxy 16
I may be smoothbrained, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt be rich.
So now we are taking advice of firms?
Hold
I bet SPY hits 500 by December 28 or ban me for one week.

Did I do it right?

Position 10 10/31 SPY 500 calls
Overbought and needs a little pullback
&gt; I have no idea what you're talking about.
Moderna‚Äôs hurting me real bad
SDC reports on Monday, moron.
That‚Äôs how I got the $69
Nicely done!
Completely loaded up on PayPal calls two weeks out strike of 232.5
welp, back to sucking dick behind a wendy's, thanks autists
I feel pity
Agreed and I'm holding for now... it looks downright reasonable compared to so many of the other valuations.
Yo wtf?! 481C 11/8 bid/ask spread is like 6k bid/ask and there is no 6k open interest

Is someone shorting here and buying their contracts back bc they know SPY is about to break ATH very soon?
Acting horribly right now‚Ä¶how the hell can a Sportsbook stock be such a loser?!  Revenue seems guaranteed.   My guess is too many degenerates are scratching their itch with WSB and FDs which shifts focus away from sports teams ü§∑üèº

They ran out of my dogs food due to supply issues. Target had it for $10 cheaper. Puts on chewy.
Be 27, 5'8", live with parents, have student loans, total loser, and gaining weight. Life sucks


Had 30k saved up

20k on Poker, 10k on FDs this past year
now I have 3k Credit Card Debt, with $500 in my name.

Do I just give up trying to be rich?

Work this 9-5 for $1750 every 2 weeks until I die?
Give me a 10 bagger please
AAPL needs to go to 200 next year. What a stupid slut
$PTON really brought all the COVID stocks down with it you hate to see it.... sorry $ZM holders
Is this a reversal I‚Äôm seeing . If we go red lookout below
Ok
SDC doesn‚Äôt have any earnings to report you twat
Feels good to go cash gang right before the dump
What‚Äôs happening next week?
Who‚Äôs getting some AMC popcorn delivered?
Made whopping 25 dollars after waking up in the afternoon. Way to go, me
When you look at a contract and see that you were the Dummy that sold at the low price for the day. Fck me I guess but I made 100% in 17 hours so can't complain.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270) it was OK  buying NVDA at 310, was perfectly OK
You said tech rug pull. So amd and appl is all tech?

Take a sit dude.
Get fucked spy ü•∞üß∏
Do yall sell out of the money calls or closer to strike. Thinking about selling covered calls on FSR
Probably a nice pot of tea
BA calls boys
I don‚Äôt think those things are gonna be all that popular. Cities put new restrictions on them all the time. They suck now in my city. You can‚Äôt just leave them at your destination. Have to find some magical rare parking spot. Fuck that. Rather just get my own non bird brand scooter and go as I please.
this is the easy daily chart 


it‚Äôs just gonna fizzle out


remember. good economic news = stocks finally go down


don‚Äôt ask why, we‚Äôre in la la land
I see a gap up to 1240.01 after 1240 easy

Spy gonna dump to prevent memes from running.
I prefer the term ‚Äúlong term value investor‚Äù

I cashed out my BBBY at 23 and already regret it.
Take a peak at that 3 month chart
yup. Looking forward to it!
To be honest I think your best bet might be to get out at some point today..
Visa took a serious beating this year
Cash out and put coins in your butt then walk around the street until you start paying out
Asks a question and then answers it lol
AMC üöÄ time
It's called genocide
You retards downvoting all my SDC rockets are going to be crying when SDC moons after earnings next week. üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ
Pls let SPY drop to 467 even if it's for like 5mins... Then it can run up all it wants and I'll promise to never buy puts again ü§ó
TSLA just needs to break that 1240 wall and then it should be a straight ride up to 1250
Borrowed stocks return to iBorrowDesk, With training wheels removed $SAVA to Moon!
Bears at it again with a clenched fist downvote barrage
Huh.  Yeah there is data that counters it based on what previous administrations have implemented and changed. Oh, and this is the new socialist dem party.  Keep that in mind as this fucker will crash.
Elon has made more in the last 9 months than Warren buffet has made in his entire life
All my dumb ass needed to do was buy next Friday strikes instead of 0dte.

Do you guys ever have a day where you‚Äôre like ‚Äúmaybe I could do this for a living‚Äù, and then the next day you‚Äôre reminded why you cannot
Yes. Apple and AMD are speculative
Give me a play
Sofi could run to 30 by thus time next week.

I‚Äôm just going to the barn to use my diamond tipped drill - don‚Äôt fuck things up while I cut my arm off ok
In real estate and we're back to writing offers $15-30k over asking price and not getting the winning offer. None of this is sustainable.
What the hell happened to BBBY? I had a work meeting and I come out of it see it's up 15%. It was deep in the red early this morning.
Man, for some ladies, the walk and composure increases their hotness sooo much. For guys also. Stop slouching guys
Dkng is trash...thank god i got rid of it
I have an impression nvda is gonna end in red
**I üöÄ LIKE üöÄGME**

Try calendar spreads if you want to actually make money with it. Buy long dated calls &amp; sell weeklies to retards that expire worthless. Use the credit to buy more long dated calls.

BBBY price target is $70 and its currently trading at $22ü§îi dont think im sellingüöÄüöÄüöÄ

If you found a strategy thats consistently wrong,  why not just inverse yourself
Citron
No one wants your tlry bags
Citron is long BBBY because the setup is like a mini GME. Low market cap. Household retail name. High SI. Not an ape just facts.

Oh did I hurt your little feelings
already down 80% on the ones i have now,gonna buy more monday
So whoever said chewy, i just read an article about a bull flag forming the past week and with earnings dec 7, it could easily get to 100
Go to schwab
It‚Äôs too easy - like hitting a poor apes cage with a stick
anyone have an actual source for that $70 BBBY price target? Something tells me it's cap
So buy puts lol
BNTX earnings next week, I won‚Äôt be getting out until then. Should be a killer earnings
85 year olds run the government.
Msft
And a longer term concern is look how much of the market valuation that's based purely on selling advertisements, impressions, or other things that aren't made out of anything. So much of our workforce and the entire equity market is based on intangible things that have no value by themselves. And the companies that actually produce products or value add services, or facing the most insane economic and global trade issues I've ever seen, and there's no indication that is real that shows any of that improving, actually most people on the ground see getting worse especially under this administration who has an idea for every single ridiculous fear porn that costs money jobs and causes utter chaos.
Ehhh doubtful
Hell yeah GME SHOW ME $250 AGAIN
AMD is going back up boys. Even a rocket needs to refuel üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Lot of focus on keeping TSLA under 1240 today, if we break that it‚Äôs game over
F this shit. I thought you said mrna is the Tesla of biotechs f u liars
anyone waiting for the next ride on CLF? or is that too sensible for this place? lol Just waiting for that $20-21 support line.

Love the $SDC bagholders screaming over a 10 cent spike
I‚Äôm not participating in beta verse
My friend, you need to read a few sentences on how options are priced. Time decay, implied volatility, delta...
Looked at the bid/ask spread of spy calls and realized there‚Äôs high demand for the 481C 11/8 so bought 5 contracts for $10
Bought uber puts when I should‚Äôve bought pton puts, not all bears are created equal
Because of rapid theta decay because it's 0dte. Probably yesterday it may have been like 2x value depending how far OTM it was
I've got 16x Jan 2024 350s last week
I lost 7 kore
Lol same, just tryin' to close them out here for a few bucks so I can enjoy my weekend early
+2200 cause fastly dipped below 50 and I sold my put bags.
Ha. Thanks. I used to be one, so this is confusing
DIS quietly running up into earnings!!!
I bet some of you have been conditioned to believe SPY will never go down again, oh boy...
the closer to expiration the cheaper the call

Gotcha.  Is there anywhere to show data on that?  There are a lot of places that discuss trading on TA, but I‚Äôm sucking on searching for info on it being bunk.
Looks like a slow and steady climb for SPY today, even at ATHs..
Go woke, go broke.

Anyone got a tissue ? PLTR taking a dump on my chest again
Correct, but if it falls back down the limit will be placed again.

It's already below it, but it's not an all in prediction. I put a grand of fun money on some spy 467s for 11/10. It could go sideways or up, but figured what the hell. Onna real note, what I'm seeing in my professional world in terms of supply chains and labor, is absolutely astounding. Every day the news gets worse, including today, more insanity in industry than 99% of people realize, and companies are able to go with the "temporary" language pm guidance, because the govt/fed is saying so, so they can. But here me now, based on what I'm seeing, this is just starting in terms of supply chain and labor. It's a total trainwreck, and getting worse every day.
It‚Äôs okay GME, moon whenever it feels rightüòå
-70% on my portfolio today. -98% all time. Can I have some kind of reward?

Meta (Facebook) is ripping today, calls are printing!
Wasn't SPY in low 90s yesterday?? RSI is, crudely, an average over time, as it seems to decline even if price stays flat. With a month out though I'm sure you'll see profit easy. Get it
Boooyyyyyyy I was just about to go all in on NIO calls then that mf started dropping again
Clown move, you could have literally tripled your portfolio on spy calls and you still can until new year
Well nvidia might as well drop to 300 now so i can buy cheaper calls for next week.
NVDA bleeding out
im staying on Robinhood idgaf the UI is pleasing to look at and its so simple
Sales are WAY down... they even lowered the price... and still sales are down.

They even had to pull back on their guidance! Revenue expected to be 4.4B instead of 5.4B.

This was a pandemic play... no more no less.

That's true. If planning on getting it back still from MRNA, you would want to aim for Feb '22... if planning on getting it back from elsewhere... there are a lot of beaten up companies from this earnings season that are better candidates for a quicker rebound.

Plus, I didn't put any money bearish until now.
People keep buying their bikes and it becomes the Apple of fitness. Really surprised they aren't targeting China right now , yesterday at the earnings call they didn't hire Chinese instructors. Also , they sell apparel. Mostly they are making most of their money from subscriptions. If you believe at-home workout is the future , then right now PTON is dirt cheap. 4x P/S

Based on what you said, I think I should be okay.

Ps. This is going to be my first time doing opting trading (assuming charles schwab approves me)
Why do we have to love that?  Because they changed their mind and didn't want to pursue something they realized the didn't want to do?  Just going to make assumptions now are we?  Fucking stupid ass comment really
Broku from Roku is back on the menu
Well, I'd rather have the 1000% return from those two red days. Duh
Oh I can comment again, cool fuck you how bout that
I 100% get that and it‚Äôs my biggest concern as well.  The market does what the market wants, it just seems like F is riding a wave of optimism right now.  Maybe the bubble will pop, who knows, not worth throwing it all in at this point but there seems to be a lot of momentum with the fundamentals to back it up.
can tesla please break 1235 ffs
i mean strangles could be the move then?
I am totally beside myself
If you ever make money on a put make sure to sell it immediately before JPOW comes and beats your ass
Call. Tf you be doing buying a put on something thats down YTD? Not sure I'd buy immediately though, maybe another week. Either way otm calls for January-March will print
Hey guys, you probably know me from a post that maybe got an upvote or two a few times. Once I got like 80, it was fucking sick (RE: amd)

I‚Äôm hear to tell you to buy 12.5 or 15 ME calls for Nov 15. I hope to make a lot of money if it pops (which it has potential if it breaks past 13.75). If you do too, that‚Äôs great, but I don‚Äôt care about you really.

Gotta love those people that go into college wanting to be a doctor just to give up, get a degree in healthcare administration and become a secretary at some urgent care clinic
Yesterday there was a lunch dip and that it blasted off the rest of the day.
Everyone expecting SPY to go down.
It'll do the opposite.
a mix, generally at first was making gains of Earning plays, which snowballed my 800, once i got a few K i went on a 6 month dated aapl calls, it was pre split, so when they announced the split, i was able to ride and hold, but held a bit too long, i wanted more. Then again i got to 38k, from loading on DIS and riding it up to 200+., and these were like 6 month dated calls too, i had like 17 june 21 185 calls. never sold till it was too late, because i held for so long, it was losing value from staying at 170, and theta eating it. it almost killed me lol
Quit being a bitch NVDA
Cannot see it coming back after the Pfizer pill announcement tbh, unless in the unlikely scenario it isn‚Äôt approved. At least in the short-mid term.

Bro... me too. I dumped them at 40% loss earlier today. No volume. 

I may re enter. Who knows.
You mean all airlines?
Hmmm, I really need NVDA to make some violent upward movement
fuck I paper handed these FB 340c, sold way to early at 4.20 instead of getting 6.90
Yeah
How did everyone on this sub get so educated when. Comes to the stock market. I know that there are videos to watch but I don‚Äôt want to risk wasting time
Stocks too undervalued imo
Someone tell me what to buy
This motherfucker retarded
UBER and BBBY comeback plays of the week! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face) I was fukt until today
Godspeed, you gonna race it?

Why?
Power fucking hour baby.

Fuck the bers
If you bought 1 share of Amazon on August 24th 2020, you‚Äôd be up a grand total of *checks notes* $75‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Some infrastructure plays but it‚Äôs not going so well right now
same!!! up almost 2k on the day
Spy calls sucked me in grabbed 470 for .33 tight stop should get a double
fuck. well maaaaybe Monday morning SPY runs up to $475
Oh gross
Hour_amphibian, I think he said ~300k
I was waiting for a day like today to switch to spy puts. Today is the day. Moderate position for next Wednesday. Don't like this
Amd calls for a quick day trade üòÇüòÇ
Fuck it PLTR calls for earnings run up next week.  I may be retarded.
Son pitching or catching?
I got lucky on the top of SPY and the lows of SPY. 

Wasnt greedy about my gains. I could have gained more but usually each play i made next,..made more than just holding for a moon on my previous move

Kept rolling them into higher strike point calls and puts

Used the early morning when  volatility was high and sold calls then in the afternoon when its slow volume bought puts. SPY gets pumped a lot. Good time for puts is around afternoon with low volume. Then before power hour bought calls sold puts.

I used all day trades this week.
Isn‚Äôt earnings Tuesday
Good, get OCGN instead
YA BOY AMAZON GAMMAAAAA SQUEEEZEEE

It's not just PYPL, it's most of fintech. They've under performed this year. Wouldn't be surprised if Fintechs outperform next year
Buying leaps is like buying weeklies but instead you'll suffer for 6 months or more
Because they are losing market share to modern fintech at a rapid pace.
I stopped fighting TSLA‚Ä¶make money until you can‚Äôt‚Ä¶then go home to LCID
is pypl going to announce bankruptcy during earnings? 30% down from yearly high and not a single solid green day for like 2 months

I never buy AMD weeklies, the stock has 3 rug pulls a day and is highly manipulated
Goddamn. Death or glory over here, huh?
Thot daughter any day.
I've sold 3x immediately before big runs. And bought puts a little to earlier just fall. So I probably missed out on at least 20k of gains and am actually at loss on the year because of the puts
GME be creepin

$TSLA priced as they're gonna be 90% of what people own in the future and $LCID will be the other 10%. No other car companies will exist. I'm not even joking that's what the market cap says.

what strike/dates we lookin for spy?
Remember, SPY is just the 500 largest companies by market weight. The entire economy could be melting down, but as long as 48% of the SPY stocks are above their 20 day MVA, nobody would know the difference
How the hell is PINS flying and PYPL still drilling? Becky fucking up my program.
Thoughts and prayers
solid move, bull flag breakout
Good for you kiddo
NVDA and AMD dumping
RSI increasing on the Monthly and 3Month but decreasing on the Weekly and Daily..

Up 5000% on BBBY calls lol
Have we ever had 5 consecutive weeks of these sort of spy gains in the last 2 years? No... We've now had insane gaps up for.4 straight weeks. Took a moderate put position on SPY 11/10 when it was at 470. Something telling my gut that too many bulls right now, usually the time to find the door
It will pullback eventually but who TF knows when. Until then, best to stay out it stick with day trading
You can go outside now
Yeah that was 4 months ago
Call or put
Up 348% on F calls since last Friday. Jump on.
I bought a MRNA Jan 2022 250C call at $228 and it's already down 20%. Nice
140 calls bought at peak yesterday that expire today.... up 100% on Intel and down on AMD, can't make this up
 that VIX chart lmao
Aw shit, someone didn't put thermal paste on NVDA before that run.
God damn now this is a question.
ive learned a good amount over, essentially i realized and its sort of the saying 'dont fall in love' with a position/idea. I got burned bad by holding on way too long, cause i thought it would keep going. IE when i clipped 28k was due to buying AAPL last year pre split, and loading up and getting more due to the split. but i got rekt in septembear of last year. then this year, i had a crazy run with DIS, when it hit 200+. i wanted to hit 40k, and never sold, and just watching my position die cause i wanted it to 'bounce back"
470c 0dtes LFG

What happened to PTON? White girls stop buying them?
I‚Äôll probably get flamed for this but selling my GME for a nice profit on Wednesday and throwing that into SPY seems like the right move
My single PENN call is propping up the rest of my dogshit options
Thanks Citron
amd is trading sideways... expect another big week next week
Imagine sinking your returns into a depreciating asset that‚Äôs inflated by probably ~20%, wsb moment
How the hell did you do that? My AMD calls are up 210% and I bought them at $126

Tsla is in its own world
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

How are those DMs going?
Mrna.. my Nogga. Stop
It‚Äôs November. Reported
Never buy an option that cost more than $2.00. You will likely lose it all
You're the one calling for pretty much a total collapse of the economy. Who's really the bitch?

Correction will happen and I will hopefully have puts during it. But a 60% market crash and money won't matter anymore, so no sense worrying about it

DIS has a better claim to being a trillion dollar company than TSLA imo
Tom Lee was right.
Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

Need to know where some good short term options choices are at to make up my losses on my CAR put I bought at the ABSOLUTE WORST TIME
I've been holding Ford for a while so, devil's advocate, but you could say their stock is up 144% in the last year and that right there was the hype bump where they became part of the conversation.  Another doubling of their market cap on top of that is pretty optimistic.  They announced F150 lightning, mustang, etc., got their bump, and now the hype is priced in and their stock is vulnerable to any bad news, recalls, etc.

I remember when everyone thought the housing market would "never crash." Absolutely not trolling and you people will be the fools when it does happen. You clearly have no clue what you are talking about. Those "trillions of dollars" are causing extreme inflation, the likes of which we haven't seen in 30 years. That is BAD. And huge economic growth? The total market cap to GDP ratio is the highest it has EVER been. Higher than the dot com and housing bubbles. So tell me again how not overpriced we are

Don't say I didn't warn you about precious metals... There is a 100% chance gold doubles before the S&amp;P 500 does.   For the S&amp;P to double (current value \~39 trillion) there would have to be an inflow of 39 trillion dollars... If you look at the m2 money supply it is skyrocketing... No one is flying into this parabolic market, they are hoarding cash.  Russia dropped the Dollar and hoarding Gold.  Time to seriously consider taking gains and what comes next.
Looking like it yep
So seriously, why we rallying so hard ? What did I miss ?

You literally just had a correction, like, a month ago. Multiple companies tanked &gt;20% in the past week and a half.

So stop making your portfolio 100% options you dope.   Get you some slow growth ETFs

I‚Äôm SHOCKED.
&gt; I'm not an idiot.
Not sure how OCGN isn't flying today. The WHO EUA approval happened which should be the domino that starts everything else and it's DOWN over 1/3 of its value since that. It's the only child-safe one (they're seeking approval now for age 2+ - none of the others will ever get that), the only one that actually prevents infection (with the others, you still get infected, just not as bad), the only one with no reported major side effects, the cheapest to make, the highest shelf-life. This really seems like one of those cases of something being too good so it's going to be held down because there's more money in the less effective more expensive crap.

Oh, and thanks to the 20%+ down yesterday, SSR is in effect today too.

I won't be satisfied until 2000% gains. Right now I'm down 60% for the year
of course, they are used by AFRM and Klarna and Uber logistics. They use blockchain, COIN uses them. This is the most obvious target in Fintech. I could be wrong but I doubt it. And if it's not in the next month its in 6 month but this is getting acquired

TTD puts already up 40%. Went with 66p. APPS, a similar digital ads comp dumped 20 percent on a slight eps beat. I think this is a good season to take advantage of PE corrections. Have some DASH puts as well that are up but tbh might just sell those late on Monday. If dash doesn't correct on Tuesday it's literally going to just go to a trillion....
Pls tell me other retards are buying mrna calls

What Nvidia guys don't get is Jensen has a certain allotment of fab capacity that cannot be increased beyond a point regardless of what he pays or anyone else pays (due to contractual agreements between TSMC and other chip designers), as a result Nvidia has a limit on its revenue growth that Tesla does not. It also has a limit on pricing, mostly determined by the level of certain funny money coins. So, IOW, you can't expect Nvidia to grow into this market cap like Tesla can into its market cap. That's why I bought NVDA puts, but wouldn't do the same for Tesla

Futures is the price in the future. The contract sizes vary a lot. A lumber futures contract is 110000 board feet. If it is sold for more then items that use lumber would cost more.  I don't want to math how that translates into a sheet of plywood

TSLA will now trade sideways all day to screw over the weekly Friday expiration calls many of you brought without thinking. You never wait until Friday to sell, but if you are lucky and it has a slight jump you may be able to sell with $1 profit before 3pm.

Of course if you use a broker with 65 cent options fees you will get less than 50 cents profit instead of a dollar but eh. You can get like a piece of candy. Dinner.

I feel like its going down right now for no reason.  Just because MRNA missed ER.  Grab some shares now while their on sale and hold them for 6-12 months, could still be a multi-bagger.   I'm not looking for overnight gains on this.

Yeah but I have a Netflix subscription Netflix got paid for without me paying for it. No other streaming service manages to have me as a subscriber on a paid subscription because none of the others can find random third party companies to subsidize random people's streaming subscriptions. I even saw a gas station advertising free Netflix for a year to new hires lately. So if you want to get paid direct subscription money for content you put it on Netflix. Or if you want to get paid advertiser money you put it on ad supported platforms like YouTube. But if you expect me not to pirate something that's not on Netflix or YouTube Vanced then you're bugging

market is literally exploding up

&amp;#x200B;

it shouldnt be acting this way tbh
Of fucking course after I reduce nclh we get a magic fucking covid pill news. Suddenly, missed earnings no-sail order extended nclh is Jesus stock walking on water. Now I have to decide do I renew the faith or is this a temp top‚Ä¶help me out here fellow retards.
I've lost so much money on those fucking stocks that I'd never go near them again
I think this is the part where someone says something about lower lows and lower highs, I bail out of my positions, and it pumps hard.
People don't realize these tech stocks keep going up because the yields are artificially low due to the fed and the printer increasing share price, also which said companies get cash incentives from to push buybacks to also increase their shares. 

That and retailer consolidation, burned out on too much crap since March 2020, so they are choosing a small pool of stocks, most of retails trade volume (95%) is in 8 stocks, all but one are tech, and that one is a bank that's been trading sideways because the yields won't go to up enough the last few months.
wallstreetbets daily threads always remind me that a lot of people are 20 years old no matter what year it is

TCNNF up almost 5% today
Sold my penn calls too early but im not gonna get too mad about 75% in one day
Yes, half of the worlds economy would tank
I'm looking to get into BNTX shares right now.  They feel like a screaming buy at 220.
MRNA bounce incoming
Wait til next week
From Caracas?
Never heard of her. Will research
FID, land/well purchase, acquisition of existing wells. Theres still a couple steps that can/need to happen before they go ballz into building driftwood. 

Its super risky but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm playing.
AMD RSI is stupid right now. I'm waiting for a pullback and then gonna grab some leaps.
Nvda needs to break the 310 barrier
fuck,knew I should've held those NIO puts.
Lol I sold 50% of positions for locked in profit
Coty up or down after earnings ü§î
too slow, IV is dropping we need something feisty
It‚Äôs okay, I sold like 35 minutes ago.
Imagine it. The year is 2025. We haven‚Äôt had a red day since late 2021. Jerome Powell has been appointed chair of the newly formed global trade federation. Governments are obsolete. Poverty has been eradicated. Perfectly efficient markets have brought near infinite wealth for all people on earth.
almost impossible to say but ive been trying to buy NVDA for the last few months and noticed it does have 10% pullbacks
I have 2023 expiration sorry this isn‚Äôt a complete degen play
I wish this market would just god dam crash
Balls to buy puts on a false bull flag
That might be legal? Assuming portnoy didn‚Äôt have any privileged info. Its just his opinion.
So same thing as yesterday? Little dip coming and then just run the rest of the day?
i like how MRNA wiped all its lofty gain in just a few short trading days
Playing devil's advocate, TSLA stock is coked up on runaway hype and speculation that won't easily transfer to a boomer ticker
Don't miss out on IVR fellas
Amd pe ratio only 40
CGC is pooping :( paper hand or buy more?
I might actually have been right buying the bottom of the ocgn dump.
Sickkkk. When u going?
It‚Äôs literally more profitable to buy shart poins
JBLU ? is it time

Biggest piece of shit
Pls tell me mrna has room to run..
I hope they drop a fucking üí£
 
I wish this rally would go on forever but it‚Äôs obvious the hedgies won‚Äôt allow it. Retail at the mercy of whales.
Turn around on PTON?
14 dollar range on SQ today         
Buying calls
CRWD calls went from bright green at open to not so green

booooo
If you're happy with the gains, lock them in and buy more with some of the profit. For me getting 10%, I'm waiting. 20% I start checking the charts again. If I see 30% or more I'm usually gonna instantly start locking in profit. If I have multiple contracts and I think it could keep going up, I'll sell half and hold half. But once it hits like 65%-75% range, I'm not playing games. I'm locking in all profits and moving on to the next play. 


Don't let FOMO turn you into a bag holder. Take your profits so you don't watch them melt away if the stock dumps. Getting 30% return is exactly 130% better than -100% return because you held for no reason.
NVDA worth buying now or wait for a dip?
What? There is major collusion; who is telling you there isnt?
Toxic broads are my kryptonite.
Some video games and pokemon cards can be 100 to 1000$ dont sell them for 50 cents
SDC, Clov, and AMC earnings on monday, surely one of these has to rocket up (or down) and not trade sideways or a .05% drop/rise. It's WSB central, the only thing that's missing is WISh, 

&amp;#x200B;

Watch all 3 trade flat, and then sell off 5 minutes before close.
Any lucid news?
It goes the other way when the market turns tho that‚Äôs how high beta works
It runs indefinitely
Zoom out and look at the chart for the last month
Yes MARA keep going up. Next week. We go to nirvana
Woohoo 250% gain on SPY calls locked in. Now lets sit back and see what happens
Bruh i hope this shit goes to $10
Hopefully this breakout comes in the next few days
clear sentiment shift on market look at how much ZM is getting punished before ER
That means puts werent making money
SPY so flat now üò¥
SPY is up today my dude
Spy puts printing ü§ë
Ugh we‚Äôre at that point where you can‚Äôt buy puts because we‚Äôre gonna go higher but you can‚Äôt buy calls because it‚Äôs too retarded. No fun
Are deep otm MNDY puts a good idea for earnings?
There‚Äôs a rig with a 3080 at costco for 2500 bucks, I am really considering pulling the trigger.
Ok I've got a theory so dumb it might be smart:

The market crash that led to the great depression was unprecedented. Ever since then it's been used as a point of reference with people posting charts of major index's saying "look they kinda look similar". Well what if all of the anticipation of a crash staves it off? As long as the bears have liquidity we are going up. 


Tldr: Stocks go up until the last bear capitulates.

Hard to believe there's not major collusion among all the banks and hedge funds that nobody is taking the money and running after these last few weeks.
  
Could you imagine if BofA moved any portion of their funds to cash and said, "This shits insane, and we're cashing in on it. "
Most have 6 figure jobs lined up before they even graduate.
PTON down today

spy goes down??

&amp;#x200B;

ive been fucked
WISH earnings next week that‚Äôs why almost 52 week low . They going to be bad I got 5 puts for today and next week
It‚Äôs down 1.4% chill ü§£
IWM calls up 50% today still low af IV hop in
Make sure to check on your Uncle MAGAs who bought into DWAC. They are not okay üòÜ
My qqq 1/21 400c are up 630%. Bought at like 1.80 during the dip and now they are 14.00 or so. So my $2,500 is now $18,200. I always struggle with exit strategies. Does this keep running throughout November?  Target mid December to exit? What would you do?
I just dont see a dip to 19-20 happening unless earnings are abysmal and all I wanted was a quick scalp ü§£üò≠ my greed might get the better of me
TSLA 1.2T? Undervalued
Watch it happen in 2 weeks
That question doesn't make any sense
All the sellers stepping up
Can't go down, right?
Meanwhile my ROTH IRA is like 109% up ytd.
My 401k is full of boomer indexes doing 18% ytd.
Rivian toxic bro culture will now be toxic broad culture.
I'd wait until it pulls back. Look at what happened after the last run. The RSI is unsustainable for much longer. Might not pull back as much as last time. But it will have one and you'll get those calls cheaper at some point in the next two weeks.
TSLA to 1250 leggo
ELY = Top Golf.  Invest ü•¥
Same for me but I'm about where I want in terms of commons. The dip keeps on dipping!
Nahh no position except for day trading calls just can't believe it's rise

DIS calls went BRR today.
If JPOW is out does market tank ü§î
Worst mistake I've made all year so far
NVDA will not be stopped
RBLX rallies 5% yesterday drop 5% today, 10k holding through earnings please don't make me regret this
the only day to be bearish is the 19th of every month.
dammit spy dont go that way
idk man a lot of fatties like popcorn hahaha
LCID and SAVA, lfg
I‚Äôm trying to see if anyone can justify them being about 1/8 of TSLA.
Let‚Äôs go HIMX break through 12! üöÄüöÄ
Those red candles are the MMs getting bored and saying aight ima head out
Because PENN has superior financials in every single way and is currently profitable with similar growth vs DKNG whose losses are truly obscene for their revenue level?
She selling premium
Fridays always end flat, right? Right??
What‚Äôs the weekend for for Monday?
&gt; It's just a little dip.
Ok√© listen up you retards and apes.

Word in the street is Apple is working on a 2022 TV serie called extrapolations. With a top cast.
To be honest I coudnt care less about the series...

But a Canoo EV been spotted on the set... black and white lifestyle van.

You retards understand how much this will skyrocket the price when actual facts come out?


Edit AAAH it's climbinning already =)!!
NVDA with the slow climb
REV calls are printing
&gt;Black swans will come and the party will end. Always does

will end for a week or 2 only before the fed swoops in and starts printing 100 billion a day
MAKES NO SENSE, this drop.
At least it rebounded! Penn flying
MARA is going to smash earnings next week.

Bullish

That should be bullish
What's it mean? Its finally moving but it's not a direction that warrants a smiley face.
I firmly believe there is a rug pull coming on Nvidia soon. Too many hedge funds and retail traders in that stock along with every ETF for it to hold these gains for long
Bought a leap on PTON because nothing makes sense
ngl QCOM even at $160 is a steal, price targets are all increasing to the 190-210 range
Depends what you mean by fuck with. The only thing is that different is you have to wait for the trade to settle.

With my cash TD account if I buy an option contract and sell it the same day, it's perfectly fine. But that cash is not available until the trade settles. 99% of the the time all that cash is ready the next morning.

So Yolo plays are limited to one a day. If you want to do a few day trades have to divy it up.
Ford owns 5% of Rivian. Rivian valuation is the 9th. Starts trading the 10th.

Looking at the value of calls you paper handed is the opposite of self love

I think all she did in college was work-out at the gym. Her college pics show her mostly at the gym.
I wondered if I was the only one that thought PENN earnings call was good. Ofc earnings were lower because of Delta variant, they still made tons of money and penetrated new markets and revenue hit the goal despite Delta. Literally nothing but good news except for EPS which was still great for how fast their revenue is increasing. But down 20%, lol. P/e stunningly low.

That thing with the barstool sports douchebag is a non story
Spce has earnings Monday‚Ä¶.get the puts ready

Why didn‚Äôt they all float around in the spaceship in the movie sunshine?

There was a slight delay. But now it‚Äôs going to boom.

Man, profit is profit. If you‚Äôre so convinced it‚Äôs gonna go up even more, how about you book your profit and then buy new calls for the same premium you currently put in?

the longer you stay low, the harder it is to get out of it
So if I call and transfer to cash account doesn‚Äôt that fuck with how my option trades are executed? At least that‚Äôs what the shill on the phone told me last time.

Typical Friday.
Damnit nvda just break 310 already. You know you want to.
You buy a derivative called a "call" that essentially says "I think the price will be X by date Y"

If it is, you make lots of money

If it isn't you lose lots of money
Rawdogging hookers, bout as dumb as it gets
agreed

jpows 401k is all in on SPY ffs, youd have to be insane to buy puts or short it, youre literally betting against the guy who can print infinite money and has no problems smashing that print button

lost interest in her when I saw she was a Trumper
I only bought one nvda 340 11/12 call yesterday morning and I'm up bigly (600%), but my retardation tells me to hold it.  Ever since selling my tesla calls that would have made me rich I'm scared of selling.  Tell me how retarded I am just for confirmation.
Out of all my retarded plays, I have lost more money on ARKK shares than anything else. Down 1% today while all 3 indices moon.
IDK if its worth the risk for PYPL right now.  Earnings has been a tossup for everything.  At least if PYPL has good earnings &amp; guidance, it will be the catalyst for a bull run and THAT will be the time to buy.
Bro did you read what I said? You CANNOT withdrawl. The devs set it up so only their wallet address can.

Baring a crazy market sell off or really bad earnings i think those should be fine. Maybe double down on a dip i think bank charter is announced in December considering thats when warrant redemption ends
It's a scam bro, anyone who owned it cant sell it.

Lol QQQ 400
Looking at the 3 month or 6 month is insane RSI is so high. It's way overbought.

I was going to play something cheaper though that could mimic the eventual pullback. Thinking AMD based on last time it skyrocketed after earnings. Ran from about 90 to 122. Now it's run from like 105 to 140. It's going to have a pullback, but it's so hard to time the top and not lose value it it still has a chance to go up as Theta decay eats the puts.

Last time I grabbed puts near 110 and still had to sell for a small loss because it ran another 10 bucks. Even though I knew it would pullback and it pulled back a lot, Theta decay killed it.

To be honest, I think the market is too easy right now. I bought some SPY calls on Wednesday and I'm up 70%. It's clear that the market will just continue to bull run until next year when Pow raises rates. It's just easy money and it's honestly kinda ridiculous lol
Why tf is RH manipulating me? I put $1k into calls and it turns to 0.01 immediately. Is this an error ?

Thank you! Yeah, I've been holding what I call my "covid stocks" since April 2020, so I guess I just got lucky on timing it, I'm only 32 so I'm holding long until they make a full recovery.  Really the only ones I've gotten rid of were PENN (thank god before the huge dip), CZR, SAVE, MAR (mistake), BUD, MGM (mistake), and PK (mistake).  

I just didn't want to be overly exposed to them, had good gains from each of them at least though, hindsight is 20/20.
Fuck you SPY. My 0 DTE FDs are bleeding over here and you haven‚Äôt moved in an hour

PTON was a pandemic play.  The pandemic is over.  People can go to the gym again.  Even if they can‚Äôt, there will be very few ‚Äúnew‚Äù customers.

Lol why did I bet against Zuck
is this going to go back up lol
PENN and Sabre worked nicely for me after buying the pretend dips; will hold.  Tempted by MRNA but also concerned that dip might be real if Pfizer are going in dry.
This happened to me in engineering, started a new job got offered others right after, but didn‚Äôt pursue the others ended up hating first job. Don‚Äôt be like me.
Idk

Most people in here have their money in the indices and make retard plays with a small portion of their portfolio
AAPL always limp
All you need to know about Pfizer as an investment is they just fucking *cured the worst pandemic in a century* and the stonk can't even do 10%
I just hope there won't be a pandemic

SPY has reached cruising altitude.
I think it's funny that in Casino Royale, the bad guys plan was to blow up a prototype airplane and short the stock. Even if his terrorist plan hadn't been foiled there's no way that's bearish for the company.

Sold my SPY 500 calls this morningtrying to sell my SPY 500 1m ban bet too
Alright NVDA 315 let‚Äôs go I‚Äôm bored
For sure. That was ridiculous. I would like to do the same with ATVI, but the calls are a little expensive. I just ended up going 10 $70 December 17.
Just bought my puts on lady spy. Don't get me wrong....I'm excited to sell them and get right back into calls but puts gotta happen first
Load the boat on this DOCU dip. This stock always gets crushed whenever the Covid/stay-at-home names get hit even though it isn‚Äôt remotely a stay at home product.
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/TheGoodSurgeon** bet **BNTX** goes from **223.65** to **260.0** before **2021-11-12 11:02:06.089194-04:00**
&gt; I was short on the futures, I thought it would go down.
Ok so you have plenty of time for the underlying to reach the strike price. 

Basically, the market is saying ‚Äúat the rate spy is moving up, it‚Äôs likely that it‚Äôs going to be above 480 by 12/17‚Äù. 

That‚Äôs the power of options. You get to magnify results.

Looks like I may have actually picked a good time to sell my calls, unloaded at 470.50 earlier. Probably we go above that later but I‚Äôm done for the day.

Having trouble finding the sell button on these 0dte TSLA 1240c
Let me address your points in order. First, stock market valuations/multiples don't affect the lives of most ordinary working people. Second, the unemployment figure of 4.6% only includes people who are unemployed *and looking for work*. The actual labor participation rate is still way down from pre-pandemic levels. The wage growth is a great thing, but it's still too early to tell if wage increases will even be enough to cancel out the rampant inflation, which is much higher than 5% actually only the government uses funny math to calculate their CPI basket of goods, so they can lowball the annual COLA increases.

I just bought puts again and I already feel bad for this. Please god let me exit , I won‚Äôt do it again
If AAPL is overvalued when Tesla is worth &gt;1 trillion on puny earnings then this market is fucked....i mean I knew that but still lmao
LMACA volume still too low
$RVNC to $30 by January. Get in now before their Botox rival product gets approved!
just laughing and laughing, some guy on here told me PTON and POSH were great long term picks and I argued with him that POSH was 100% draining and PTON just needed one bad quarter to implode.

And here we are. Dude had a fuck ton of money concentrated in them... on margin
I've made 50k in 2 weeks, never thought that was possible
Fucking stupid I have to wait a full day after a transaction so I can invest the funds again
cmon himx go to get some gains so little jimmy will get some meat on his sandwich

It beats the new M1 max but it‚Äôs a close race. Almost equal. 

Also they have a new guy in charge and he‚Äôs an engineer not a money guy.
Imagine selling ABNB calls first 5 min cause you didnt think itd go higher

Imagine panic selling UBER calls in first 5 min cause you thought itd drop to hollow earth

FUck
Creizy loser apes
We priced in a perfect recovery before there was any actual good news but still want to go up now that the actual good news is rolling in. And bond yields are dogshit so what else are we supposed to do.
3 month out NVDA , LMT , and FB calls woulda been a sick play last week.
Think you mean EOD
Let me explain‚Ä¶
Gains? Lololo‚Ä¶.but yes, holding cash, waiting for an opportunity in the next couple months.

Survived the DKNG ER üòÇ let‚Äôs get back up there now biiitch:)
Awesome times - enjoy
Bought it for $19.00 a few months back, overjoyed to sell it in the $35-$40 range. I will hold some back (about 20%) on the off-chance they merge with an established manufacturer or license their tech to Tim Apple for the Apple car. Otherwise though, I tend to agree with you, it'll fade off.

Himx crushing through that $12 wall!
Whoever mentioned HIMX earlier thanks. I didn‚Äôt actually make money off of it as I watched the call I was going to buy jump from .1 to .5 in 30 minutes without opening a position cuz I‚Äôm a pussy. But thanks for the opportunity.
Sadly I wasn‚Äôt either (wasn‚Äôt investing yet) but I see how obvious it is that huge run ups typically lead to big fallouts. Very uncertain time in my opinion
I was as big of  LCID bull as you could find, think they will win the luxury EV market place. Even I think this is stupid.

$NVDA is fucking stupid

They‚Äôre not stagnating tho‚Ä¶ 
Alder Lake is looking good. 

TSM can‚Äôt keep up with production. Apple is a higher bidder than AMD. 

What does this mean ? AMD will have supply issues. Intel can fabricate their own and has capacity.
Sunflower seeds are popular in trail mix, multi-grain bread and nutrition bars, as well as for snacking straight from the bag. They‚Äôre rich in healthy fats, beneficial plant compounds and several vitamins and minerals. These nutrients may play a role in reducing your risk of common health problems, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes.
I'm not complaining, but why are my SPY calls up like 48% when index is up 0.72%? Oh well, brrrrrr it's nice with some green numbers against this cold üßä
Yeah - take me to Vegas
Incoming lucid motors rug pull :) please pleaseeeee
LCID has to hold that 39.40.
NVDA 350 EOY
I think she has given all she had for this week.  Good luck.
I think I‚Äôm done playing. See you guys next time when I actually have money for some ungodly reason

NVDA low key incredible

guess ill clutch onto my shares in tax adv accounts and never do something stupid like trying to sell covered calls on them lol...
Like a King
We can only go so vertical right?
It's irrational exuberance.  A lot of investors in today's market weren't around in 2000.

Not saying you can't trade it but a lot of people are all-in on the assumption nothing can go wrong or that everything will easily bounce back up.
That was certainly NKLA
LFG 320
Keep buying PTON.
Spy sucked me in can‚Äôt help it bought 472 calls for .11
NVDA and TSLA overpriced
People putting up sell walls on NVDA are pussies
Supply chain disruptions. Real inflation around 13%. Massive unfilled job openings. It us bad
Re: the first part -&gt; stock market != the economy
He also has puts against NVDA at 180 next summer. Let‚Äôs make sure he loses that bet.
It‚Äôs up 2% that‚Äôs not even close to squeezed to death.
I have way the fuck too much money in options to let it sit over the weekend. Green finally for year, heck even making back last year. 

Would suck if this week turned portfolios around but greed said let it ride and Monday takes it back.
NET is the pets.com of this run
Where can I see earnings for next week? Gotta think about what to yolo on
AAPL is probably overvalued at this point - will be interesting to see what happens ex-dividend
Push to 345 Zuck LFG
FOMOed in to NVDA @310  will update later how that play
I'm just rolling calendar spreads at this point. I welcome the barcoding.
Paper handed nvidia yesterday towards close. Biggest mistake I‚Äôve made
Because the beginning of the year was a shitshow. Biden FUD, China FUD, virus FUD. Some people in here have PTSD from it
5yr AAPL is up 432%
5yr Spy is up 120%

Gotta zoom out. AAPL is not a short term play. It‚Äôs a buy and hold for life play.
they were dead the moment you bought them.
I thought I bought the NET dip, I did not.
Put it this way, if you're Elon and you bought FDX outright, every share, you'd have a company that still makes $86B per year or for the same price you buy NET and make $530 mil per year..
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/FrontSurroundSuccess (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 700.0 when it was 825.85 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

LCID bulls with the biggest boners right now
NVDA wants to go vertical again
Why do so many people think the economy is bad? The S&amp;P is nearly up 30% YTD, NASDAQ is even better. Unemployment is at 4.6%, GDP went up 2% last quarter and wage growth is the highest its been in years. Sure inflation is up, but it's only 5%.
Watching AAPL underperform the market so consistently is frustrating af
playing it rn :) thanks for the inspiration
Bah Gawd Not The Steel Chair!
nah that sounds like a balanced day
IMO always take profit NFA
LOL
But where is the fun in that?
Mine are failure by design and life itself
I dunno. You should make enough off your calls that you don't need to be a gay bear and buy puts on the spike, you can just sit back and watch it bottom out and do what- that's right, BUY THE FUCKING DIP.
NVDA to 350$ next week

$RVNC in oversold territory, should bounce back to over $20 a share over the next month and then back to $30 a share once their Botox competitor product gets certified. Don't say I didn't warn you!

Tesla. Lots of believers it may actually become an iPhone in automobile industry. (I‚Äôve been talking about this in 2014) the green dildo news are: cybertruck/high chance of stock split/commercial solar panels/semi truck industry/huge demand (for example model y- 6 month wait) If someone big will order 1000+ Semis for their fleet the stock might double only from that. There‚Äôs a lot going on with Tesla. Musk for president of the planet

Trillions of dollars Have been printed and huge economic growth since last time Spy was at $200. 

Even the worst crash you could imagine would not bring it to those levels.
I am very happy that PTON and and MRNA are relatively small holdings in my portfolio - else We eat ramen and kids are stuck trying to get a table tennis scholarship at a public university

Recency bias. 

Until a few years ago, Intel dominated CPUs. They still sell a shit ton more than AMD. 

They got off track for sure, but they aren‚Äôt going anywhere and are extremely undervalued compared to other tech/semiconductor plays now.
Stocks really do just go up
Just wait until they actually start raising rates.
I had a Wendy's double bacon cheeseburger for lunch yesterday, and then a vegan dinner. Does that make me retarded

&gt;Step 1: all in GOOGL

&gt;Step 2: that‚Äôs it there are no other steps
Ahhh, predictable PLTR. Insiders selling the price down. Really getting too easy selling covered calls in this range.
told myself this would be a short 1 week long play but I kind of want to hold on
CHPT/EVGO/BLNK.  Bill is going to have heavy subsidies to help charging-station companies meet the capital needs of a very quick buildout.  Think a charging station on every street corner.  

It's a no brainer, gov't supplies the capital, these companies use the money to buy assets, then use the assets to make money.  Even PCG (PG&amp;E) owns a network of charging stations they're trying to build out

Facebook is building their own hardware, like every other tech company. They use NVidia now  but GPUs are straight up not the future. Look at the Apple M1. THAT‚ÄôS the future.

Alternatively‚Ä¶
Ok, Facebook buys shit from NVidia‚Ä¶how much shit, exactly, are they buying? Enough to make a 100P/E ratio look less ridiculous? The answer to that is an easy no. Nvidia‚Äôs previous nutty valuation of 60-80 P/E was baked on the assumption something like the metaverse would happen
Enter ford now?
If the infrastructure bill passes today, we‚Äôre gonna need a rocket to catch LCID.
NET has a $63B market cap, thats about the same as $FDX.  Except Fedex makes $86B in Revenue per year and $5B net income while NET does $173 mil per quarter.  This is how far from reality the market is for some stocks.  Even if you compare them to FSLY or AKAM its not even close.  AKAM trades at like 5 p/s, NET is at 111 p/s.  Big correction coming by next year imo.
I feel good
Cmon MSFT bb you can do 340

Normally I‚Äôd agree. They just released their new chips this week and they beat Intel. Even the i5 can keep up with AMD Ryzen 9 5950x.
12/16/22 SPY 500c are free money
volume is almost exactly the monthly average for the whole year.

SPY is 'running out of gas'
Lots of believers it may actually become an iPhone in automobile industry. (I‚Äôve been talking about this in 2014) the green dildo news are: cybertruck/high chance of stock split/commercial solar panels/semi truck industry/huge demand (for example model y- 6 month wait) 
If someone big will order 1000+ Semis for their fleet the stock might double only from that. There‚Äôs a lot going on with Tesla
Nice natural gas and uranium dips this week
I bought puts and calls on nkla, but waited too long between the purchases, somehow they're both down 95% hahahaha fuck me I hate everything right now
Are You sure it‚Äôs not a reverse loop slant hook, with a wedge formation into an articulating cup and book parabola?

Spy always goes up on low volume
I have a 55$ call for 11/19 let‚Äôs shoot for that
I basically do this too. Where I am only allowed to do options with 10% of my "anchor" account that has 90% of my equity. The 90% equity goes into individual stocks I buy like MSFT, VIRT, BLK, JPM, KO, and other boring shit that makes 20% returns a year. Then for the 10% I throw that into covered calls on GTLB, calls on CRWD, calls on AAPL, etc. When I profit 150% on those positions, I put that money into the boring 90%. Then when I get another pay check and find a play I like I do it all again.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont do this constantly and never force plays. I've gone months without doing an options play because I didnt feel confident in buying anything. Buying SPY covered calls long term is probably one of the best ways to get 150% returns on a position without much downside (losing your 500 bucks).
Tight. Now I just gotta find out how to make a bunch of money.
SPY is going to get put to sleep on Monday

Easy!, $40 at reach!!!
That fckr Cramer was right at least for this week. He said that retards would stick with what worked for the rest of the year. If your stock was up bigly, it would be up biglier. Retards would keep buying and pump that shit regardless of taper, bond yields, etc. For this week his bald head may as well have been a crystal ball. 

So much fckn money made on the last 2 weeks, and it just pumps it bigger and bigger. Can't believe they cucked so many people into selling back in September...
Me too ü•¥ thought we were breaking out

Break time over, get back to work SPY.
If there‚Äôs one til I learned with PENN, it‚Äôs always buy the allegations
It's called a blow-off top look it up! Tapering has been announced and what does the market do?  3 straight days of big fake green! I'll tell you exactly what's happening. The final stage of the market bubble. Notice the extraordinarily low volume on trading each of these days. The big boys ain't buyin'. I figure in the next month or so we'll have a serious pump maybe even to the tune of SPY $500. However, the collapse will be epic. We are going all the way down to SPY $200. 60%+ selloffs on all major indices. Bookmark this and call me nostradamus later when it happens cause bulls are major fuk
my port was down 50% on that tsla dip and i averaged down like a chad and got out with profits on the spike, fuck you gay bears and paper hands
The things i would do to break even
BABA getting crushed. Back to $140

As long as you call it a gambling hobby and not a business
Anyone buying spce?
One thing I learned off this sub before I could make any serious cash and maximize my gains/ minimize risk - You DON'T have to re-invest that gain immediately (or add to your account), you AREN'T missing another opportunity and you DO need to take a walk/break after that big gain/loss...

Don't rush anything, the right play will make itself known. Does anyone look down upon someone who made 700%? Not really (not even the guy who made 1,000%)... Speaking of which, look at when the gain posts invested. Figure out the basic logic they had at the time, don't assume anything's foolproof.

That is 28 bucks just this year. Too unreal. Get in while you can fuckers. Shipping congestion is not going to be resolved anytime soon. No significant new containerships come up until 2023. 2022 will most likely produce 15-20 in EPS.

Got an amzn  3500/3600 spread last week before earnings that expires today.  These past couple days has reminded me why spreads are good, since max gains happen on expiration day. Went from being -100% to positive.

options are really bad plays when the fed is tapering and inflation is at all time highs. all this investment from stupid people is going to make the market crash hard af lol. I've never seen such bad plays in my life. this is like 1929 bro. i wonder whats going to happen.

I sold my 11/5 himx calls yesterday at 50% loss ü§≠
If you're going to yolo you're small account into something, buy a spy call at or just out of the money for at least 30+ dte but preferably over 60 dte. Forget the daily charts- unless the entire economy as a whole is in a decline, the overall trend of SPY will always be an uptrend. Flip over to the 20 day, 180 day, and the 1 year. Get rid of RSI and MACD because they're going to read as overbought and give you false sell signals pretty much constantly. 


Then, after doing your due diligence of course, drop your $500 account on the calls I described and strap into your rocket. It won't be massive $50k gains from a $500 investment but you can grow your account by $100-$250 every day or two if you do this consistently and remember not to get greedy. Once you're at $1000, put at least $500 into long term investments, rinse and repeat all steps. 


This isn't financial advice and I don't know what I'm talking about. Just a thought I wanted to share.

I got jan calls for 60c , good?
You can't buy options after hours or premarket. So you would've had to buy them before close last night. The price changes right at open so a market order would've filled at that $10-12 range and a limit order below that wouldn't fill.
$AMD is gonna break down that $140 wall like the cool-aid man

Was on the verge of getting NVDA calls when it went to $300 but didn‚Äôt because I‚Äôm a little bitch. Now just watching it soar.
If I put $SPY on your radar, and you did well, I‚Äôm genuinely happy for you. However, what is going on now ‚Äì there should be legal and regulatory repercussions. This is unnatural, insane, and dangerous.

They make too much money and are a real company sorry bro maybe they should sell 5 electric cars next month
Is there any reason to not buy Tesla calls?
Portfolio powered by INTC. Up $10k on calls since earnings.
No volume maybe
Everything rocketing. Some news come out?
To baghold MRNA or not... ü§î
Remember when applying to options you have a over a million dollars in stocks, a 400k a year job and you started trading options at 5 years old. 

When applying to credit cards you have a 6 figure job and $100k in yearly investment income.
Made a quick 150% on two TSLA 1230 calls. I'm out for the day boys. Up 4K this morning.
I don't think so. Options don't have extended hours and most people revise their bid/ask before open. Having said that, I always have trouble trying to price my options after a big AH rise/fall. First 30 minutes of the day, the options market pricing is usually screwy.
Going all in on QQQ puts see you on the other side bros

Up $1000 today, but is that even real money? These are just numbers on my screen, none of this feels real man.

0 chance of getting them at $2. That was the price at close yesterday . They ranked earnings so the options price doesn‚Äôt update until open at 9:30
You lose a couple times and then take back to 10 baggers?
its flair from 2 years ago. I lost a lot of money and dont short anymore
Maybe she‚Äôs busy you dumb bitch

Hey guys, I have a question that might seem silly. I‚Äôm just reading, browsing and I ended up on Peloton puts. There were puts in the $70+ strike range this morning for less than $2. at 9:30 on the dot the price shot up to $10-12.

If I had placed an order for one of those puts pre market, would I have had a chance at making the profit? Or would my order not have been filled once the market opened and the options prices were much higher? 

Thanks so much for your help!

Edit: would have used robinhood to buy the puts, not sure if that affects anything

300% dude just fucking sell lol
I learned this the hard way a couple years ago (see flair) The reality is the stock market goes up 90% of the time, so betting its going down is a poor bet based on probabilities and only works if you have perfect timing. I dont short anymore.
Going to my local GameStop to buy $ATVI ‚Äòs new Call of Duty
That's what I've been holding the cash for, but whenever I find a play I pretty much regret not putting more into it. I know I'm never gonna go balls deep and do a 20k play, so why do I even lie to myself and keep that much cash.

$SBUX from $105-115 was one of the easiest plays I've pulled in a long time. Ran calls a dollar up on the price a month out every day and made money selling the next.                 
                 
If BYND goes sub $100 today then I'm picking up $100C and $105c because that leg up is definitely going to happen.                     
               
I don't even like either of those companies but I'ma pocket that money. Always looking for what I consider easy plays like this.

Wait. How is this eva question? It will be 475 next week easy
Only 3% here üò¢
Why else getting cucked by AMD ?
Make the trade and then just switch brokers
My SPY call is printing! Fuck yeah! Up almost 300% from yesterday. Do I sell now or ride out to market close?
It‚Äôs been a pleasure serving with you son
Wat
I‚Äôm always so solid at holding during dips but that TSLA dip took me out and now look üôÑ
Oh. Disregard. Am regarded. 

Edit: Actually, it was higher on September 2nd last year than it is today. But yeah, I was thinking monthly.
Bezos gonna get him with the split
Disney is gonna run until earnings
Nvidia struggling.

Not sure what to do. Hesitant to buy dips and calls, but anxiously adding more puts as earlier puts die. stress

Bad earnings outlook as well as supply issues.

Talking to this girl everyday for past two weeks, met her at the bar, only made out so far. but she has me on 12 hours unopened rn‚Ä¶

When she responds do I dead her for a few hours? Show her I ain‚Äôt need her if she don‚Äôt Wana talk?
You would think with all the extra cash they have they would work on reducing the number of shares. I don‚Äôt know what their game plan is besides just hording cash.
PENN is charging the fuck up
All green candles lmfao
MRK jumping off a small ledge also
there will be some great buying opportunities in the near future I suspect
AMD $150 EOY 

Actually not a meme
I hope it does so we can get more cheap calls
Can not believe I was able to get out of my fastly 50p this am. What a great fucking win

No resistance past the moon to pluto
I just got into DNMR, with the Climate Accord, the ever sloth like infrastructure bill. the unusual option activity, and 14% short interest my Dec calls @20 were a flipping bargain. Christmas money is always a plus! Hohoho DNMR to the moon.  üéÖüöÄ
now is actually a great time to buy some SPY puts
What is up w AMZN lately?
Son of bitch
It's funny how this sub changed how the way the market moves because it taught millions of people about options.
PFE is a pain in the ass to hold tbh. It never holds its highs for too long, but who knows maybe this time is different
Where's my HIMX bois
V is a strong independent woman who don't need no man
House Infrastructure Vote = SPY +10 on news. Infrastructure Bill signing = SPY 500

Anyone else worried about hibernation season? Been seeing a lot of skinny bears lately.
I‚Äôm looking at 375 range. $400 is having trouble populating for me on my broker. I think even 375 is pushing it unless you‚Äôre convinced this is going to accelerate like TSLA.
V calls printed, but my paperhands should have held longer. 

I'm actually batting 1.000 on V calls though, even on the downturn I made money on them every day in the last 2 weeks.
Spy been nonstop green af w no stopping
palantir earning next week. have some cheap calls. already green. just this red i don't like it. but looks like it just make my calls worth. as it market worth raise a bit.
and all of a sudden we remember QCOM
We need to break 471
I have no idea why spy is at 470 but hot damn the past year and a half has been so much fun

PUTS on car are still a few weeks out and cheap. Looks like its being shorted like a mofo and its calculated price per share should be around 210 a share so.... sure why not. Fuck it.

I forgive you
Spy puts are absurdly cheap right now
First one is free.
I'll acknowledge it, but I still will buy calls

Good morning. Waking up to my 50 PFE 6/22 calls had me rubbing my eyes.
If you don‚Äôt get this stay away from options you will go bankrupt. Exercising you have to buy 100 shares as your option is a contract to buy/sell 100 shares at the strike price. Just trade the premium

OPEN
explain to me like I eat crayons bc I have never made $ in healthcare aside from MRNA when it was 80 in the beginning of the pandemic and I got out when it went up 10 bucks. WHY, when PFE has the literal CURE is it below 50 and never really moves?
Just made money tho. Stonks
LUV
things starting to look shaky up here
$NCLH get your ass back above $29 so these shares get called away. Please, I am begging you.

It's actually unbelievable when I think about it, but it's true: I have the ability change the direction of the entire US economy. I buy SPY put and SPY goes up. Even today, I'm trying to get my limit order calls $469 calls in. They filled when SPY hit 470.25. Look at us now
my ass was puckered as I loaded the boat pre-market
Stop buying CAR. Let it die.

Puts on your knees and back
Thinking about holding my calls but idk I‚Äôm already up 120%
These valuations are pricing in literal decades of growth, but okay
Is this 2020 part 2 üêÇ
Tried telling WSB to copy me and do this
Fuck should I double down in this dip or take profits
I think I‚Äôll load up on the TSLA dip. Later in the day ‚ÄúPay-tience‚Äù
Inflation. $200 2 years ago could take a family out to dinner
I‚Äôll try it
Finally Re entered ford
10y low af tech should be skying
Yes but through calls not puts that I held for too long. I literally bought what WSB said and I lost haha meh I can always deposit more...... into my td account which is still golden
Its ok NVDA take your time while my calls bleed if you don't hurry up smh
Ford? What are you doing?
NVDA slowing down
Its a great company overall this stock action is fucking me over too damn
This sucks I wish we could‚Äôve climbed more steadily into year end now instead we went full retard and now we‚Äôre gonna have to whipsaw up and down for the remainder
Omg. Cramer pumping FB / META so hard right now. It's hilarious
We killed NVDA. Bought the hype, now I‚Äôm taking the ride üìâ
I mean not really but I thought it was done running like two weeks ago so what the fuck do I know
Bro think about it? Who tf is using FB? You me your grandma, it‚Äôs a tool they aren‚Äôt doing anything. While you cry about ‚ÄúFb so bad ): ‚Äú wall st just doubled their money
get your profit into AMC, she is running
It‚Äôs already up 18% in a week what more could you hope for?
Why would you even think about them looking stupid when you bought them weeks ago and you look at short term swings.
Fuck yeah we are
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
PTON call FDs may actually do work
How does anyone see 700% gains and think they somehow missed out on fomo
Bought spy calls at the Top yesterday morning.  Six baggers.

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Nerdcubing (0/1) made a bet that GME would go to 250.0 when it was 221.93 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Was just about to buy a 1340 tsla call for next week lmfao
[deleted]
!banbet GME 300 2 w or I‚Äôll try squatting 600 lbs
Since V is on the mend officially, time for some long dated call options?
Holy fuck man I‚Äôm actually in the strike price. Should I just take a profit on my first option for $54 or try to hold it till the afternoon for more?
Fuck you square
Where my TSLA tards at never listening to you again
Spy just playing around 470. If it breaks 472 I think it‚Äôll hit another run up.
SPY absolutely destroyed my puts. Have a crater for asshole now..
NDAQ needs to stop being a bitch and go back up. Fucking up my AMD
PENN got over sold. Rebounding now
Does anyone know what is going on for V, it surges on no news
Tesla wtf u dumb whore
That‚Äôs not true, we are just now 3% away from the monthly moving average
TSLA puts starting to print. Made bank on calls on the way up, too.

[Told you 0DTE uber calls was 5x+ bagger](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qn7rh0/daily_discussion_thread_for_november_05_2021/hjetwym/?context=3) 48c was trading for $0.22 at the lowest

Sold for 2k
It‚Äôd be pretty tight if AMD could Harlem shake through the pressure
When spy hits 500 I‚Äôm closing all my positions and going all in with 200 shares at 500
PFE 52-week high is $51.86

I wonder if we can beat that today.

When I started browsing WSB two years ago, I won $200 on my first trade. I was so happy. Took the family out to dinner and we joked around about how I have an actual job, but I get excited about $200.

Yesterday I got $3K from a trade, and got pissy because I sold early and could have gotten $4K.

Yeah I sold my calls after fed meeting they were 462 exp today : (
Can MRNA find a bottom here and look for a bounce
What call or putt should I buy and date
it made no sense, the report was actually decent imo, next quarter is going to be really strong I think... should have bought at 40$ in the pre-market...
I feel like I deserve to be a little greedy with my puts as a tesla bear after a month of extreme greed by bulls
Maybe CCL is going up because kids can get vaccinated now?
TSLA wrong wayyyy

Been my biggest plays also, since it's easy for me to stand behind them (big traveler myself).

Remember kids- always do drugs.

PFE smashes earnings and ramps up production. Announces a covid pill and this mfer is still can't break 50. Talk about useless.

Could have just bought spy calls this whole time but noooooo
This bitch will tank EOD into next week.
Buy it further out incase there‚Äôs more heel dragging

MRNA is dying. Good. Now, GME can follow it and we're back to non-retard in no time
Yup
It‚Äôs going to blow up
Who told u all about cheesecake factory 2 days ago? Me
1) you don‚Äôt know my entry

2) They had the growth to support it. Every other person who bought ‚Äúthe top‚Äù in MRNA over the last 2 years made huge amounts of money. 

I can‚Äôt stand smug hindsight pussies like you my account is 10x the size of yours I don‚Äôt need your advice broke bitch
ok...2 minute breather... back up 945.

OK folks time for me to ask, "Why are SQ and DKNG up despite missed earnings?"

My daily dose of I Don't Understand the Market At All.
Underlevereged
Never buying SPY puts again. Holy fucking shit.
Don't sleep on LOGI shits gonna be back up to 100$ in no time
It get me a half chub every time
SPY 500c 12/31 x 10

They're going to pass the infrastructure bill and shits going to go gangbang
I have officially been fucked by $bntx.
Bought SPY 469 FDs yesterday for the meme and 10 bagger
133% on 11/12 SpY 470c I‚Äôll take it
Zillow to $20000 EOD
Probably one of those evnews sites where they make an article every time elon tweets
The market is obscene. I'll take it though.
You might be ok
Cheesecake Factory, McD‚Äôs, Cracker Barrel all up, great day for shitty American restaurants
Well s*** I wish I bought more Disney calls yesterday for next week.

Fucking tits boys
not cool amd
Got a letter at work from one of our freight companies that rates will go up 6% next year. This is the fifth letter I've gotten like this in the last month. 

Transitory
I‚Äôm thinking of making a quick in and out play on NVDA, what strike and expiry do I buy
I lost $2k yesterday. Got $800 of it back this morning. Calling it a day. Last thing I want to do is revenge trade.
I had cash ready to buy SOFI dip and it‚Äôs not dipping much. Bullish.
i wish i had the liquid cash to really play NVDA now, IV is too high pricing me out
I fucking love seeing my account go green. This is what I live for. To see green
[deleted]
Damn I should have sold smfh
Damn SPY going parabolic but all my stocks down
Holy fuck my boomer portfolio is up 4.5%, now I KNOW you boys are making money, my CCL calls are printing too LETS GO
WTF NVDA, wrong way!
Not even market rainman Jamie Dimon could have predicted this level of bullishness.  

SPY 470 EoY? try 500 buddy
[deleted]
Bers get not breaks
Holy shit gme is fucking useless
iam playing PFE calls
200%
‚ù§  been taking forever
DKNG making my account look like a heart monitor.
I waste so much time picking options and the best thing I ever bought was a Jan 2023 $365 SPY leap. Sigh.
Only a 1 nutter?
Lol god damn, that nvda death candle.
Well I sold 80% of my spy calls I bought yesterday. Coulda held but decided to not be a pig
Maybe I'll buy some OTM calls on Pfizer and sell by lunch. See how much I lose.
Nvidia you cocksucker
And.... It's gone lol
The secret to a good magic trick isn‚Äôt making something disappear. You have to bring it back üî•
Spy ceo could cure homelessness if he just sold all of his shares

Shhhh, stop yelling you'll frighten the market.
Took gains a little early but it‚Äôs fine. Gains are gains.
NVDA wrong way
Peloton -40% eod?
I threw 4K in just to ride the roller coaster, I am with you, praying it goes up but not quitting my job at Wendy‚Äôs‚Ä¶
I just bought 300 back to back shares of MindMed. Godspeed the industry of psychedelics.
If its good enough to screenshot its good enough to sell. Lost 200k unrealized GME gains that way
I guess I need to stop trading. I lack fundamental understanding of the market and its behavior. This is all insane to me
Just buy GS every time it gets to $400 or lower and your going to earn a few points in the next week guaranteed
Jan 21 ‚Äò22
Square puts getting fucked .... Jesus this market is retarded.

Would‚Äôve been better off if I just bought SPY calls Monday and closed the app..
blaming FB for ‚Äúinciting violence‚Äù is like blaming Apple for the dumbass shit you send to your ex gf
up 2000% 

IDk what life is
How much margin are you guys using? Using a conservative 10-20% myself
I guess, I think I‚Äôm more surprised that the market actually decided to care
Intel such a great 3-6 month play right now. 

P/E really low, new Alder Lake CPUs are very good, and semiconductors demand is sky high and they are one of the only that can fab their own.
Don‚Äôt doubt the üê≠
Ya think?
Please let this be a +1% day on SPY
Nothing better than a Friday when your boomer VOO position is up 3 bands.
BNTX is fucking plummeting...
so when buying puts on memes, is way otm the way? I bought NVDA puts yesterday, then sold them for the same price this morning even though it had gone way up. I"m thinking i can just keep doing this until i'm right.
I'm holdin on. I could use the w right about now
Unloaded my SPY 11/12 470C at open for FAT gains. Purchased Tuesday at .35 sold today for 2.30.

You know, I just can‚Äôt believe NVDA

TSLA needs to stop fucking around and moon.
Garbage company. The pandemic was literally the best thing that could have possibly happened for them, and they couldn't turn a profit.
How does market react to NIO earnings usually? Sell the news as usual?
UVXY just goes up on red days now huh
TRIP just got me a pretty penny
soo spy 500+ eoy isnt a meme
Why are my SPYG calls not printing as much as I thought?
Everyone except for pltr eating today
Doesn‚Äôt make since for the options orders to go through if the price is tanking but somehow can‚Äôt complete when it‚Äôs juicy and going up
Wtf TSLA just WSB stepchild now I guess ?

Fuck you the most
Yesterday's draftkings calls breaking even. Incredible bounce
"for years", fyp
Lol, all the options orders I put on for Penn were suddenly at half value at market open, why the fuck don't options prices update during premarket and is there even any reason to place an options order not during market hours
OMFG, poor BEARS, I almost feel for you but then I remember October.
IWM TO $300

I should've bet against DKNG myself.


I hate sports but love gambling. I downloaded their app hoping to see a some odds and just bet on some UFC fight outcomes. The UI was incredibly unintuitive. They wanted me to build teams, guess round points, way too much bullshit right out of the gate. You get me a sports betting app that looks like it was actually designed by someone under 40 with some confetti üéä  emojis and I'll be hooked.

I‚Äôve been making money on spy and Tesla calls and am ‚Äúbagholding‚Äù Tesla shares. You truly are dumb
I have them too. Probably unloading at open. I‚Äôm already up 200% on them at close yesterday.
If I exercise it right now it says it‚Äôs market value is $110 and my total return would be a loss of $2. I thought you could only exercise options if they had reached the strike price and if not you lose everything‚Ä¶ sorry I know I should‚Äôve done more research but I was tired of playing with shares
Every time he thinks about you
Looks like my dis 172.5c expiring today might be saved
You bought something that is up 300% over 12 months, you should of known this was a possibility lol

lol, ah jobs report, pfizer pill are two big ones

$SPY is being so fkn American rn üá∫üá∏
Not a clue. My guess is that it‚Äôs already so far down that even with the rating downgrades it‚Äôs still like 20% below the average price target so basically earnings weren‚Äôt great, but not as bad as the market had priced in.
Wen ?
Which way?
Wait for the split
Same here and u/axemanfromMa

At least we know she isn't making insider trades.
I assume it‚Äôs a call? pre market isn‚Äôt looking bad. Could be a lot worse for your first options trade.
Fr tho half'n'half is always a great choice. Half at open and take the PM gains. Keep second half till 3-3:45.
How fucking crazy would it be if NVDA closed up another 12% today
I‚Äôm buying shares. I believe it will return to 50s by end of month just like it did this exact time last year. This is an overreaction.

Sell PTON and DKNG shares for a loss or baghold for years?
I don't care what anyone says. This week has been the most entertaining week in a long time.
It's almost certainly Paypal. And more SPY calls.
I'm going long, and shorting PTON
i &lt;3 you VM you sentient fuck.
GoPro heading towards 15 on huge earnings beat that validates their evolution to a small profitable business with margins and revenue improving despite rising costs and supply constraints, revenue almost as big as their market cap, down from highs earlier in the year with lots of room to run
And my Zm
so im selling my call at open thats expiring today
MSFT gonna rip today. ATH before market open should be a good sign
When futures are making cup and handles you know your fucking bullish asf
Short DKNG at the open? or long?
Be weary of rug pull at open. Then if it doesn‚Äôt happen load up on calls

Rug pull guaranteed then. This is your warning lads
Going big on DKNG
Except Pfizer is mooning
havent seen a damn good thing on their app in months.
Spread the chances brother, all of mine expire today. Balling on a budget over here but, ill never turn down profits, probably gonna sell nvda and buy a couple more for the 19th after earnings
Buy Treasuries and wait 70 years.

&gt; Pfizer is a pharmaceutical company. It's stock price has grown by over 30% in the past year, and it currently trades at $36 per share.
I hate it here
Pton just spare me
I wish I didn't sell my QQQ call.
But then I was up like 179%. It had to go
# TQQQ Wow just WOW
Really wish I had dropped 50K in a year ago.
If the unemployment numbers and inflation numbers were accurate, we wouldn't need QE infinity or a 6 month warning before raising rates by .25%

Yeah you right I should‚Äôve known Pfizer was going to cure covid before they announced it what was I thinking

Getting fucked by premarket dumps on consecutive days really feels like fate giving you the middle finger
Already did that yesterday unfortunately.
Always cracks me up
Yea keep SOFI nice and cheap for me, I need some $30 march calls
Why? Lol üòÇ
Not done, but let it settle today
Thank you for the detailed explanation! It‚Äôs my first time getting into SPY calls so this is super helpful.
Or you could just not buy the top
Stop it for 1 second SPY we can‚Äôt just make me money these other guys need some too.
profit is profit, buy more today its not stopping

yeah thats what i did, long time back.  free advice, the Theta crush will rob you of all of it.
Gamble on infrastructure.
Genuinely, probably any of the biopharma stocks that are down today on the PFE news
Is DKNG really about to spare me?
Same...lost my shit this past month.
PFE announced a new covid antiviral pill, not sure why travel is pumping since weve had a vaccine for a year now, but this is the 2021 market so stocks look for any excuse to pump really
&gt; I am not the one you should be asking.
so im guessing we are all done with TSLA?
[deleted]
SPY is a value stock until 500 at which point it becomes a growth stock
Same, made small profits the past 2 days. Even had a few 11/19 466 calls... Fuck me.
I bought Wednesday, 50 @ $487 for Nov22. Cost me $555 to get and I'm hoping to exit either today or next week if its a good run. I've heard and seen a working strategy is to buy $20 OTM for just over 2 weeks out. Usually around $0.1 per contract and if SPY rises $5-10 in the first week or so you can nearly triple you money
My only regret is not buying more SPY47011/15s.
I think they keep running until we see what happens with Rivian after launch
Popcorn means people buy soda

So those 12/19 466C before jpow spoke WERE free money. Was only like 5.50 premium.

That is valid. And yes, income tact started out only for the rich, and then the Uber rich changed how they get their income to avoid these taxes. These new taxes are simply trying to catching up with them.

Soooo Pton calls at the close?
Yeah probably easy $. Don‚Äôt think you need that long though, probably higher % by buying 6 months, rolling them, and you can still rest easy
Amd Spy, long in bb shares aiming for 10k
&gt; Yes, same thing.
Rents not patient
Don't be daft.
Put that money elsewhere.

That's how you double your portfolio overnight
**BOLD**
i think so as well, IV is always extremely low and KO can actually rip sometimes in the morning, even a half percent move causes options go up like 50%
Today looks like a day to chase the rotation to reopening trade stocks; just watch volumes early.  If big volumes come in early, all those names (airlines, cruises, travel/leisure) should run for a couple hours.
literally no one thinks that (that‚Äôs actually been part of the play since January or before)

Is Ford going to keep riding the pump train to Rivian's IPO debut?

Answer: yes.
One concern, I see as valid, is that historically taxes, e.g. income tax, started only for the rich and then was expanded.

Someone else suggested that when you take a loan out using equity as collateral that causes a taxable event which would force you to "realize the gains". This might be a decent approach. Again this would need to be for the billionaires.

Logic works just fine. Logic says to gain money instead of lose it. You just couldn't listen. We're in the market to make money, not be right.

Safe securities are great collateral because they're typically stable. 

That loan makes the bank money, which employs many people, which also allows them to loan to average people.

The recent election added to the fact that we are in the beginning of November - you have to try hard to lose money now.  I know somebody is going to read this and say "hold my beer".

Let‚Äôs all remember that we can stop looking at all those terrible ideas that will expire worthless today. Friday is always cleansing.

I'm hoping to see RIOT over $36 today if corn can break out of this consolidation and get back to $65,000 or above during market hours.  Prepared to see corn drill to sub-$60,000 which would probably mean a $32 close on RIOT.

&amp;#x200B;

Also hoping to see CVNA at around $230 to end the day, which would be about a 22% decline.  There's such a shallow after markets and pre-market that you won't see the big moves until the market opens and liquidity is present.  All ready have $260Ps expiring today.  Might pick up 6DTE at open that are way OTM to hopefully play an IV spike if nothing else.  Prepared to see it trade back above $320 and my puts expire worthless.

They've been pretty careful the last 35 days to not get too bullish. I need Cramer to start asking where the sellers are or else were going straight to $500

I don't think they'd pick a day for everyone. My guess is everyone can pick a day.  In any case, there will be tons of manipulation.

SPY $469 is the sexiest thing I've seen all week
Just so we're clear, these taxes aren't for you and your tiny assed  gains. You know that, right? 

Theses kinds of taxes are for families worth $100s of millions who never sell their investments, since they can borrow against those investments virtually for free and live off that. After generations of not selling, the thinking is why not tax these investments at some point since these people are living off them indirectly.

But thats half the fun!

So if an option spikes +10,000% but I don't close out and it drops - how does the unrealized gain tax apply to that option?

Yea but its like 1k in calls.

SPY calls take me to tendy town!!!!
It's easy to say in hindsight that throwing it all in at once is the best option (and it would have been the best option for me), however it's impossible to ignore the chance of a correction
Imagine if we had a President that was neither senile nor full of bs conspiracies.   (Note - such a comment  can‚Äôt be classified as political if I hate everyone equally)

We shall see, your positive sentiment is noted

If you need a play , do lotto 0DTE QQQ puts or buy puts expiring next week for the CPI data release next week on Nov 10th , nasdaq should be going down on this job report

With the jobs number situation we might even see PTON only down 28%

IWM calls was best decision I've made all year.  Nov monthlies will have turned into 10 baggers at open.

Good job numbers mean bears go extinct today.
hmmm. These guys flying under the radar?
If the infra bill passes it means alternative investments (where lots of people became rich over the last year gets cut off and taxes for those making money in stocks goes up to 50% - double what it currently is.)

Please don't pass the infra bill lol
No, because the fed is tapering. It's def bullish now
u/AmeriMan2 throwback to when we bought calls before taper meeting/have held
SSYS beat earnings expectations by 116% and went up 27% yesterday.


$DDD has earnings next week. I‚Äôd get in early.

$DM had demands increased. 

$DDD once again. 10 patents and a tute loaded 211k shares yesterday.
$330!
Draftkings clawing it's way back after earnings sell-off. Revenue missed, but guidance and growth still look solid. My calls may not be dead yet. üôè ü§≤
So when Powell gets reappointed next week we going Hulk dick green, plan accordingly
1. $365,000 home at 2.875% and 20% down is \~$1685/mo on a 30 yr, this includes taxes/escrow.  OR at 5% is about \~$2044/mo, this includes PMI as well. 2br rentals (in my area) cost $1300-$1600/mo. An Income of \~65,000/yr is technically viable wage. Most often times couples buy homes, so that Income will usually meet or beat that amount. 
2. Previous home owners who move to a new home are largely unaffected, as they move their equity into the new home. 

The market is cooling off, but its not crashing.
DKNG rising from the ashes lets gooooooo!!!!
The near capacity hospitals in CO say otherwise
reasonable 310, but in an unreasonable market 330 today
Is that a bet?
$TSLA obviously. Okay probably some $NVDA too.

Trying my best to not get super political here, but how is allegation against Dave Portnoy any different and any more credible than allegations against Kavanaugh?

Remember "believe all women", until it all became groundless and hearsay? Portnoy is a paper handed bitch, but I don't think it's fair to call him a sexual predator yet.

That said, buying PENN leap calls at the market open.
Well I thought I could day trade the same exact options( date and price) as many time as you want on the same day. I didn‚Äôt know it would cost me 3 day trades on the same day
Everything is bullish now
Most likely 473
Buy them for 11/19

Don't get too cocky hoss

Be as paranoid as you need to be, but the vaccine actually works pretty well.

The big price spikes have had influence from large corporations buying up homes.

This will either fuck the big corps, the prices will steadily fall as they sell off their real estate, or the prices will remain high for the foreseeable future. 

As a 26 year old, I'm pretty fucked no matter what
Guess I'll have to fomo into NVDA calls to make back my losses on NVDA puts
RIP my DKNG calls
If spy hits 472 at any point today I'll get a tattoo by years end
A day late on that.

Why is Disney mooning? DIS üê≠
Just ask your girlfriend politely to stop doing it
NVAX calls &amp; PINS puts
Why would you buy calls on Donkey Kong when you saw PENN earnings?
*Matt Damon voice*

wicked fuckin' reta'ded
You're new here, huh?
A stray dog would eat a rotten sausage that‚Äôs been cummed on. Just carry a few of those for next time
F
I don't think they care. They just sold this for $3 fucking billions. In 3 years. That's all it took. LMAO
ill have about $50 when market opens. loss of almost everything.
 Damn you could see that coming a mile away. Shoulda done a banbet that she would leave. üòé
Rumors of a kids digital fitness thing has been in the works
In 2 minutes Spy should pop $1 or 2 quickly
* $213M of revenue in Q3 60% up YoY.
* Launched in WY, and AZ
* MUPs up and revenue per MUP is up from last year.

Net losses are higher than expected, but it is explained by the expansion in operations, and products.
Why is the stonk emoji red?
Tuesday at open
Same here. Sense of relief.
No one here that‚Äôs for sure
Purposely?
Could be a good move. Need to cater for the people staying home and streaming too....oh wait![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
Yes another üèÜüèÜ

- Aunt cathie probably
Im actually amazed at Ford, they've been trying  so hard lately. A+ FOR EFFORT
Don't want to do DD, whys moderna crashing so hard.
I'm thinking of buying today cus it's low
Old money: don't fight the fed
New money: don't fight the teslaüöÄüöÄüåö, fuck your pootsüåàüêª
If your using RH you can just eat the 90 day restriction at open if you have that much money on the line or you can use a 1 time day trading flag were they waive the 90 days for you
There's nothing more American than losing money on stupid shit.

Other than maybe obesity.
NVDA is the shovel maker during the gold rush. Its not overvalued, its exactly where it should be
Yesterday I was trying to decide between PTON puts and DKNG calls‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.bought the fkn calls
I just added to Merck yesterday

I just gave this stray dog my bacon egg cheese sausage breakfast burger. Fuck shit cost me $15 but that mofo hungry
Lick it and jump scare him
Waking up to DIS is a nice surprise ü§§
To me it's history in making üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Thanks. Hopefully this will make up for my paper handed TSLA play from a few weeks ago
*how low cannnnn it go*
Do it then post the loss porn
Keep saying.

Next trillion dollar company will be nvda
Get fukd
How so? I sold Disney last week and put the proceeds into Meta.
Yeah, we got a couple pretty good places run by new york transplants down here (iirc one even has water shipped from new york for authenticity though i wouldnt be surprised if thats straight bullshit) but theres not a single place here i can get giardinera on my pizza and that shit is the beeeest
&gt; I like the idea of buying IV crushed PINS calls.
You are Poor
is my bag holding flat af PFE for 19 months finally going to pay off, or is this also fake
Fucking gross. I hate cocomelon. And Blippi. Don‚Äôt get me started on Blippi.
What is happening to Salesforce?
thoughts on buying IV crushed PINS calls?
If it tastes like that textured soy protein no ones going to pay chicken prices.
[deleted]
Everything is priced in and more
Lol this. Covid is over. Those who still think it's about the virus are ignorant shills for Big pharma.
Almost everyone I know is home. More discretionary spending and I actually like being home
Tesla != Nvidia
Well, after yesterday, it‚Äôs not getting to 25K anytime soon
Can't even buy these stocks they're so bright green
No wonder my wife left me I can‚Äôt even make money üò©
If you're renting she gonna dump you.
Good point. I've yet to get in but that jump inn the night makes me sadni sold at 142
I'd hope the one you bought kills u next
üåàüêª
Hmmmm so PFE 0 dte calls deep OTM
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

Roblox calls before earnings?
We‚Äôre definitely headed for another housing crash.

People bidding way over asking and paying way more than they can afford.

The Big Short 2. Michael Burry is going to interview a stripper who says she paid 100k over asking on a trailer.
Came here just to talk shit on PTON
Those results are ridiculously good.  Pfizer fair value is around $60.  Ex divvy today, should rip.
How do I teach my dog to stop putting his asshole in my face when I‚Äôm sitting on the couch?
interesting, a close buddy is avid wrestling fan, and super bullish on WWE and mentioned of a potential sale to FOX actually. the fucking ROCK bought XFL, so this is starting to stink of some partnership or sale.

all things considered it makes sense he would sell. I havent heard a damn thing on shane, stephanie, or hunter taking reigns of WWE which was super odd to me. 

I know his wife is a die hard politician these days.

lastly, WTF NJPW is coming back!?!?! that brings a smile to my face :)
I‚Äôm sorry sir I don‚Äôt know what got in to me. GME 400 0tde coming right up.
Yea but when it gets on the same fatality rate as the flu it will no longer be topic of discussion
If you think SPY is going down before Thanksgiving, you also probably held puts because you thought ‚Äútapering‚Äù would be your rug pull event.

You are UnAmerican üåàüêª‚Äôs and we laugh when you lose money, but you can still live here so we can toss coins at you while you suck dick behind Wendys.
Guess what else they are on.  BODY.
(Asian Femme Boy btw)
Overhyped*
Called it dkng tanking these puts are going to print
![img](emote|t5_2th52|5958)
Lol, generic therapeutics already exist that are 90% effective, and have 50 years of safe use across the world. But you go shill for Big Pharma and support the most corrupt industry in the world.
Wow, MRK put holders in lambos just as much if not more than PFE call holders! ü§£
MRNA wiped out all my gains for the year I‚Äôm done
Yep‚Ä¶NY slice, Chicago deep dish, tavern style‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not rocket science, but it seems certain geographical locations just can‚Äôt figure it out‚Ä¶
F = Fucking tendies
And most are penny stocks with insane amounts of shares in their floats
üôè
Wow ok, literally not a shill and I learned about most of my tools through comments here and got gold last time I mentioned a free scanner.. I'm offering my alerts which are backtested so you don't have to pay, not exactly effective shilling you moron
You guys ever think when you're holding calls on a stock that's up 13% this week and you're losing money it could be your strategy that's the problem? Or nah?
Your ass has barely recovered
My OTM spy calls will be printing before 2022
$DIS going straight to 180 today!
ABNB saving me from ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) today. Those 180 11/5 calls should help bail me out for terrible earnings decsisions.
That chart looks nice, but I am not touching any chinese stock.
SPY $500+ 12/1/2021
many have fallen due to weed stocks
I appreciate he has other priorities (Covid, economy) but Biden hasn't shown much inclination to decriminalize at the federal level, which is the big catalyst we need.
They are great. Just buy at least 3 months out. Fed announcing 0% interest rates means money has no where else to go other than stocks for reasonable returns. We may see pullbacks, but the indexes will keep rising more so than not until money has somewhere else to go other than stocks.
Just have a account worth more than 25k broke boy
Southwest calls are underrated. You heard it here first
Probably not I bought puts
Oversold, you mean.
Yeah ik bro. I do this strategy here and long exp SPY calls deep OTM
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
At least i used the money to roll into spy calls so im still green as fuck.... but at one point i had qcom calls, pton puts, and the pfe calls i mentioned ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I sold because i "always fuck up earnings plays" welp... new way to fuck up but still fucked up lmao
Keep staying locked up in your basement surviving on stimmy checks. I can‚Äôt imagine being so afraid of the world.
I'll pm you, such a great community
[deleted]
It does when you see that only a few components are propping those indexes up
Some institution just bought 211k shares of $DDD
Take more till you feel good then lol
He already turned me down ü§ß
Almost like Jan 6
Pfizer just cockblocked my Merck play.

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
INTC gonna run
Not low enough, wi-fi bikes are not worth $18B even.
Bought PTON. 

Ride or die, bitches. üö¥
TSLA has that crazy look in its eye, staring right at AAPL.
My main goal is to blow up and turn into a theta ganger, be in bed by 8, show up to shops 30 min before open.
PFE was the play I think
u/zjz won‚Äôt let me banbet long exp
ESPN advertising?
oh yea, we definitely dumping at open.
[deleted]
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Cuz it's a shitty overhauled sector
If MRNA is losing, why isn't DWAC mooning?
The fact that you believe that shows you‚Äôve completely bought into the narrative. 

Let me ask you something - do you believe everything Jim Cramer and CNBC tell you about the market ?
We mock them constantly for being shills. 

Other media is no different.
Moonbug/Cocomelon started in 2018. Just sold for $3 billion to two former DIS Exec.. Why are we betting on stocks?
And when SpY inevitably climbs another 10% after you open your position, you'll come to the painful conclusion that taking a contrqrian position on a trend is a dumb fucking idea
Can someone nut the vaccine into me, please?
Thata 10% less effective than the immune system


No one cares about covid.
Oh no, Here I was kicking myself in the ass yesterday for not Selling Tuesday When my same call was ITM.
Rooting for you, but there's always wendy's if things don't work out ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|kissing_heart)
I‚Äôm bout to bust
Fuck i miss good pizza, the south aint got shit for pizza down here
All my cc's suddenly being exercised early? Wft
I dont understand why it is Down from that ER - it is clearly performing a lot better than all the competitors
How this sub isn't all over US cannabis now is an absolute mystery.
WSB ruins another life
Exactly. Nobody would even notice we were in a ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù if it wasn‚Äôt shoved down our throats every day. 

I wonder if people needed the town crier to tell them how bad the Black Plague was‚Ä¶
ü§°
Im tryna double down at open but get out by like 1030 lol
Put holder
Not the "best" bet.
It‚Äôs comical when he tries to sound smart giving investment advice.
Wen?
Last Friday I made the mistake of not selling my 0dtes in the morning and bled out all day only to have my brokerage sell them before the EOD pump. Learned my lesson and I will be selling in the morning then buying 11/12‚Äôs during the mid day lull
just tell him to go get a job like a normal fucking person
Hope springs eternal for morons, after all
Bull here

Dont sleep on pfizer. 

They just announced a pill to combat covid that is 89% effective
I keep buying the dip on $MRNA and it keeps dipping
No way I sold my 28 contracts of DIS FDS yesterday üòÄ for ZM FDS üíÄ
ü§°ü§°ü§°
Sell pre market or after hours dumbass.
Prolly sold cause everyone told him he was gonna lose it all üôÉ
Thats what you get for being a üêª
Short 60 ES contracts
It was too obvious , didn't expect the price to tank 30% but we living in a different market now where NVDA can gain 100B mcap intraday from a PT change
Shut up
God damn I fucking suck at this
assholes are already ripped. don't ask why
I meant to buy 295C for 11/12 on Nvidia but instead bought 295P for 11/05 yesterday. The other problem was that Robinhood doesn‚Äôt warn you that you‚Äôre out of day trades until you start selling
Amd
AMC needs to shoot below the ground today
Cut each bill into ten pieces
I hope so, if my calls go up, I'll take my 15% and be happy
Meta will make a lot of multi millionaires
How do I make SPY go back down to 466? This shit only moves in after hours and premarket.
I admit spy is retarded for moving 8 bucks in 3 days but I also have calls so why the fuck would I complain
PTON calls?
Read a DD on workhorse so obviously it can't go tits up 6k into workhorse calls at open today
Imagine investing in Nikola
DIS with the overnight success, you love to see it
Just woke from a coma, how‚Äôs my 90c pton calls looking???
Saw Dune on my shitty living room and "saved" my theatre going for this garbage. I have the same level of decision-making for buying calls, too.
Good earnings and they continue to cut costs and i think /r/sc might have actually been on to something saying vince might be trying to boost valuation for a sale before he croaks

That being said, its too much of a crazy fucking company for me to buy in, but i still really like their product

Fuck i need to catch up on wrestling, haven't been able to watch in like 6 weeks and between WWE and AEW theres so much to catch up on, not to mention i havent watched NJPW in years. I like all 3 companies myself
Damn why wasn't I told to buy a PTON put yesterday
Ya but Toyota is only a car company.  Not a *technology* company.
Market doesn‚Äôt care about jobs, it doesn‚Äôt care about tapering, it only goes UP.

Buy calls
OPEN THE FUKING CASINO!!!!!
Thats what ppl did with tesla 

Look
Lmao, glad I don't have to fake numbers.
Banbet, ya bitch!
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah?!?!? dude whats the twitch handle, i didnt know this was streaming on twitch lol legit one of the only things my TV is used for these days.
I can‚Äôt see TSLA dying down one bit
[deleted]
High job numbers are bad.

Black Swan event bad
When u find some lmk
You have puts hoss?
Too many better options out there‚Ä¶stay away‚Ä¶PayPal is a buy, now
The one time you decided to inverse a position, it was one with legitimate DD that was well researched and explained.

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
I'm a chickenshit with leaps and let them go way too early. With SoFi I think we're early enough that it only goes up from here
What a coincidence
Well actually get decently OTM puts before earnings for better leverage.

PTON puts could be up 1000% come open.
Why
Imagine pton has moat

Dude I stuck a radio to my BMX in the early 90s. You think competition can't stick an iPad to a no moving object?
[deleted]
Jobs report??? Just keep printing money puppet boy!!
the only hedging i do is making sure i have some dry powder to double down on my calls, but i go for longer dated options now im not built for the FD game
‚ò†Ô∏è
yes but no but yes
[deleted]
Really looking at ford..it may just ride the Tesla hype once Tesla dies down a bit.
if you're like me, you won't have any money to do that anyway after this fucking fiasco
Makes since since Woods sold both and is now in Draft Kings.
Pfuck them
SPY gonna rip my asshole in 11 mins
Just buy calls.
Been watching old runs of wwe on twitch, I'm bullish
PLUG will be cycling down‚Ä¶FCEL still plenty of upwards runway‚Ä¶you‚Äôre half correct
Stick to this strategy and don't listen to the degenerate gamblers here.
Shoulda bought more F calls, shoulda bought more SPY calls.
warren buffet probably
Something tells me Pfizer is going to continue to rip all day long. As someone who works in the medical field, a reduction in death/hospitalization of 89% is 
#huge
honestly if its below 1k left, might as well ride it out
Boss is in a training all day. It‚Äôs time to fake my outbound call numbers and loss money with you degenerates.
What's the play here? What are you going to do, leaps?
i‚Äôm never playing earnings again
I mean that's a bet. He chooses to take it or not
[deleted]
im gonna get shit for this, but WWE?

stock be looking NICE!!! ER was good too.

BTW im an AEW fan first and foremost.
If SPY hits 472 I'll be able to afford grad school hahahaha
I wonder what happened to that AXe retard who had Spy 450 calls this time last month and I roasted him to pieces.

I got the upvotes.

He got the Lambos
no pton, just sarcasm. spy 500
Wow. Got raped by holding PTON and DKNG shares. Fortunately just a small part of my portfolio, but who said holding shares for the long term was a good play‚Ä¶
Well, you know what they say, a new sucker is born every day.
Calls on hash browns
If it makes you feel better i sold my $45 11/5s tuesday to cover other losses/hedges..... fuck
VisualMod
Not yet wait till 472
would MCD be that badly affected?
#when does the fake ufo invasion begin, bored with plague of coincidences.
damn thats pricey lol i was thinking 260-270 puts. thats insane you made a profit on your car sale! ive heard stories of this and it peaks my interest. my fiance was considering doing this but the dealerships were just fucking with us on valuation. 

may have to try carmax or carvana then! 

either way, i agree with you. once chips make a comeback next year, used car companies like CVNA are going to eat shit and drop.... may even be worth going mid 2022 250 puts wayyyyy OTM
OXY anyone?
"No"
So full port into BODY 11/19 $10 calls, got it
You might be on to something here
Keep on jabbin‚Äô üíâ
REAL CINEMA
Bear trap SZN
It is overvalued based on all technicals. Doesn‚Äôt matter tho. Stonks go up
With all this NVDA hype I‚Äôm getting tf out of my calls at the first peak this morning.
Difference is that Apple makes a commodity that everybody needs. Outside of a core group of fitness fanatics, nobody is going to pay a premium for Peloton products when Nordictrak can make the same bike for way cheaper
WSB - *You have been retroactively banned.* You have been banned for 40 millennia
Threw a tsla bullseye, but yeah overall darts are in the wall.
Feels like a deep dish pizza day
Nvda calls seem the safest. Or Ford. Might get a couple stangs out of it
Take profits, and think about the -25% plan next move
Take your trash shill and shove it
Spy is being absolutely retarded huh?
Or perhaps it is a now-endemic virus that perpetually mutates to evade and defeat  humanity‚Äôs hubristic attempts to eradicate it.
I'm gonna cum
SQ to sub 200 üòàüòàüòà
[deleted]
I sold my shares last week st 142 thinking that this shit is staying flat even if something good happens.

Should of fucking held
So, is the play now to inverse any position she takes?
Find something like a Peloton
Either i dont hedge my bets before close and everything is red in the morning or i hedge and everything is bright green in the morning lmao, oh well, some minor lost gains but i imagine if things stay high for open there will be some good dips to buy my higher strikes back on. Either way, looks like another good fucking day coming up üòÅ
He might be only guy that sold at literal peak
Volatility is not likely to increase across the board much higher than it is now. And because of the volatility smile, something that far OTM is going to have an insane IV already.
F calls unless you hate money.... again
#PLTR EARNINGSüöÄüöÄüöÄAM I RIGHT?
Tell Covid that. See what it decides to do
It‚Äôs up 10% from the earnings low.. that‚Äôs a nice pump considering everything is going to TSLA right now lol
While yes all the Green Day‚Äôs are great and the market is on easy mode, I can‚Äôt shake that unnerving feeling of not if but when that fucking rug pull is coming. /u/VisualMod what‚Äôs your take
No, it won't. It will keep killing the unvaccinated and forcing new lockdowns.
&gt; Yes.
There‚Äôs too many tards who think those people have any effect on them. The paranoia is real.

Once it's confirmed it leaked from a lab after being created by Fauci's gain of function research, you'll have to turn on Fox News to remind yourself it ever even happened.
Hard to say. The whole miss was due to buttcorn revenue miss, rest of the business did good.
So the secret to financial independence is to short companies that went public and melted up hard during the pandemic? Got it.
That bad huh?
Did you see it jump up 10% then fall back down?
Gotta turn 50k into 500k today. What's the move?

Who‚Äôs going to be buying the PENN dip? Thinking about it.
He is 3 years old . He has plenty of room to do good in the next 14 years. If he was 16 in high risk, maybe .. but no je it there.
When lambo?
Yup, I don‚Äôt know if I should just sell and rotate or hold. I‚Äôm gonna regret both I know it
what are the political implications of a 17lb potato?
Come to Houston and if your dick is cute and smooth I‚Äôll kiss it bruh

You have a wife? You procreated? And you raise a child?

Yikes
How are they doing? Is it too late to get in? Really want to make some money of the Qs if I can
i would‚Äôve been up yesterday evening.. now i‚Äôll lose everything after this morning‚Äôs moves
They wouldn‚Äôt even overlap, nerd
These are q3 earnings, only two weeks of NFL.
Nice job! Gonna be a great day
Buy PayPal instead
Dude 400 before the month is over. Meta manifest
My dumbass bought NCLH calls after earnings thinking they reported after close and not before open. 

PFE just saved me.

$PLTR today boys
It seems like profitablity us starting to matter. I wouldn't touch it

Right but the beauty of it is you yourself can take those options and then ignore those people.
Dune was awesome.
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
&gt; I'm not sure. It's a good question, but I don't have enough information to answer it. You might want to ask me something else or try asking the community instead!

You really think it's worth buying leaps on?
Can mouse stay green or will it sell off at open as usual?
This.
Great long
No until cathie buys
Luckily my DKNG calls expire in January, however the strike price is $55 since I bought it at the top a couple months ago ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
I don‚Äôt think so man
Weak
My 3 yr old begged me to get her college money out of stonks cuz mommy‚Äôs worried about a crash?
Yup haha you can relate

Never knew leaps could move so fast lol
Wait until the media gets bored with covid and it will suddenly be cured
Ape together ban
You mean BI did what no one else could
The Eternals was fucking horrible.

Also, SoFi dipping, so loading up on more leaps
Nvda 0 dte $350s could print massively
Jan 300s, as soon as the semi conductors get put in all the vehicles sitting in fields the used car values will plummet.  I sold my Impala to them 4 years after I bought it for 5k less than I paid
Does AMD even have a top?
Stock betting hasn‚Äôt tho
Don't look at the account value and compare it to $1M focus on getting to 10k. At 10k the climb to 25k is a annoying. Once you hit 25k don't drop under it. Cut losses early and keep it above 25k. A few well placed trades will get you to 30 then from 30 to 100k becomes easier (day trade options in a bull market). At 100k its easy to get to $1M.

So small focused steps then you start making leaps. Then you win.
no thank you. let us know when the dividend comes out.
If NVDA can go up 15% in a week because of the Meta announcement then motherfucking Meta itself should go up as well.

It blows my mind that FB hasn't seen a pump yet.
He‚Äôs ded
The $50P were 0.03.  All they gotta go to is 0.06 for a 100% gain, lol.
dkng pton rkt

If you think mods can actually be banned, I have some naked pton calls I‚Äôd like to sell you.
PFE really looking out for my retarded $160p FDs on NvAX I bought yesterday.  A real homie.
If he held they would be worth more now.
You nut and it keeps on sucking
Nvidia is a monster that I wish I never sold at 230
SQ down after earnings...buy the dip or stay away?
Some mad fucker on Webull bought 43 $45 @ .26. He better go pick out his lambo.
it's because there's too many tards who refuse to take either of those options.
Watching options flow and I liked the way the chart looked. Also someone I follow on Twitter was going for it. Honestly you can probably just call me a broken clock lmao
See you other Tesla call holders at lunch in the bread line today!
That's the definition of not knowing to cut your losses and bagholding.

You're better of selling and finding a winner to make your money back, not a flaming bag of shit company.

Dropped my DKNG calls for only ¬Ω loss. Today would have been 0
Even better because all the dividend sellers already sold. The rise now is on the COVID pill.

Anyone else here using ChartsWatcher? I was a beta tester, it's live now.. free to use but the paid version is better because you can back test alerts have more alerts etc. I can share my alert configurations with anyone using a code.. getting better every day, and they actually listen to suggestions.. you can chat with the developers on Discord

Martin Skreli was right.
What dey sayin' bro?
PTON entering a buy point for me, prolly gonna eat a short term loss but IMHO they're a good company who's investors got overzealous with growth projections. I think they have a good business model and have established a core foundation of loyal customers similar to AAPL.

#PTON DOWN 33% pre-market! New bike called Napalm?
Give me $1000 and i can turn it into $1
If this earnings season has taught me anything, its that whatever you think is the play, inverse yourself, and then inverse your inverse, and then maybe you'll have a 30% chance of getting it right
Any of them due to hyper inflation. That 1k will have the buying power of 1$ today

You know when one queue at a supermarket checkout is shorter than yours but then yours becomes the longest so you change again and it keeps going forever? Thats my number one investment strategy.
Yes, during the Dotcom there were companies literally working out of rented warehouses that were IPO'ing in the billions. At least most of the shit on the market today is established business with supply chains intact. 

Overvalued? Sure. Worthless? No.

That's the difference.

That‚Äôs a tuff call. Get it wonka wonka ü§°
Anybody else luck out with PFE calls? I have 4 of the 44.50‚Äôs expiring on 11/19 that I will be selling today
Dkng sells off on earnings days it's the couple days after that it goes up .. if you got in on the dip and have some trading days or months you should be fine don't panic sell lol unless you holding  FDs .. then Id go full blown panic

I browse everyday and it's been a long time since we had a series of DD for the same stock. It's just mass media doing ttheir shit again

I wasn't around for that time period in the market, but isn't the difference this time that not every single tech company is crazy overvalued? We don't have *too* many pets.com running around
&gt; I got it at $11 and sold a bunch of calls the week before.
That‚Äôs how unprofitable companies work. If you‚Äôre profitable there are actually sane ways to value your business and people might trade based on them. If you‚Äôre not then everyone is wildly guessing based on current metrics and future assumptions about the metrics and future assumptions about the economy and whatnot. Makes them more volatile
Thinking about DKNG.  I looked how profitable in-game betting isüöÄüöÄ
You must mean AMC because AMD is going up
BBBY making a turnaround, who else is long in this. 400M stock buyback, and how can everything else go up in the rising tide and this is still down- shouldn‚Äôt inflation be a rising tide everywhere?

So if PFE opened rn (up $5/shr), the 0dte $45c would be up like 16,000%... That right???
Chances Pton rebounds to 60s?

3k... what?

I only put in 2600 initially into investing. Im down to 830 now.

If i put 400 more in but then lose all 3k, i get to write off all 3k via taxes?
im holding through ER, fuck me softly market. 

plz
no way.  Pton is a no growth company that's losing money.  if you lose money, you better be growing at least.  they're going in the wrong direction.  People are just going back to the gym.

Ooof DKNG bad miss.  Too many competitors in the gambling market due to low barriers.  Everyone has to burn huge cash to try to win the market.  States open, but then you gotta burn.  Hate that I had to sell my shares.  Been holding since the days of DEAC.

You will get there. It sneaks up pretty quick.
I‚Äôm Bagholding sharws at 65. I think it‚Äôll recover slightly
not that that will bring my position back to green, but a bounce is highly likely.
It‚Äôs possible but as long as big tech keeps growing, there is nothing to worry about. After all, a lot of tech derives it‚Äôs money from discretionary spending in the form of ads and services.
It‚Äôs also a nifty way to avoid taxes.
I do not see that happening, but I it did I will be a millionaire.
I have some! $46c. First bought in like a dumbass at 25cents before realizing it dumps on dividend day. So I averaged down to 15 cents each yesterday. Wish I had averaged down even further. Either way it‚Äôs my first lotto hit (assuming no fuckery) so I‚Äôm pretty stoked!
FCEL very weak premarket . 9 puts will print . No support till 8.75 area
If I tax loss harvest my PENN and CRSR shares at the end of the year, my tax liability will be very small
Actually that rule is changed, one removal for the entire lifetime of your account.
Net and Ddog calls were the way. Next waiting on auph buyout
everyone calling it an obvious short after its already dumped 30+% in afterhours is highly likely going to get shafted.
Draftkings shitting the bed on earnings too.

The past couple weeks, outside of Tesla, has been an absolute mess for earnings calls. Cathie wood getting her dentures kicked in.
Imagine coming into this sub and still taking yourself too seriously
I want to buy F calls why do I want to buy F calls I remember when you didn‚Äôt touch F calls
Why when the economy was crashing, people said market goes up cause it's forward looking. Then when it's exploding upward, and tapering and rate increases are coming, they say, shut up and buy. Makes sense.

I just asked the other day why Pfizer wasn't higher. Glad I have a few. Sad I didn't sell my MRNA shares when it ran up to near 500 a few months back
As long as nvidia stays above 300 before open I‚Äôll be happy I learned to not care as much about premarket. But if it starts going below 300 I will definitely be mad as hell

You see it hitting today or even going up from where it's at now? I have 340 fd calls and I'm already up because I got them yesterday before close but I feel like the run isn't over so I'm contemplating about selling at open just to lock in profits

Yeah that's where you find most of their CPUs. They put them into "professional" type laptops because they sign deals with the manufacturers beforehand to use only Intel processors. They probably get them at half price or something. Most of the general consumers (people building their own PCs) choose AMD products because the price for the performance you get is a much better deal than Intel.

BUY NVDA CALLS BEFORE ITS TO LATE! LETS GET THIS MONEY!
# bears dead
Jensen Huang (NVDA CEO) on their last earnings call: "So I‚Äôm pretty certain that at this level Omniverse and the metaverse goes to be a brand new economic system that‚Äôs bigger than our present economic system."  
  
This shit is undervalued at anything below $1T, its gonna go hunting for MSFT and AAPL if the stars keep alligning for them the way they have been.
It's what happens when you get stuck holding the bag.
Imagine not buying TQQQ at 88 in last march dip because "AcKtChUaLy LeVeRaGeD eTf ArE nOt FoR lOnG tErM hOlD"

The crazy thing is I bought a NVDA call at 3:58 yesterday for shits and giggles but lo and behold
AMD needs to move to a price point that makes it split like NVDA
&gt; I'm long on Apple, Amazon, Tesla and Netflix. I am short the S&amp;P 500 index fund ETF SPY.
So glad I've held on to these calls, AMD ripping again.  Jan 110c gonna be up another 400% today for a 20 bagger.

Yeah but there are lots of news. You gotta focus it somehow to the interesting ones.. I missed DWAC, LCID and some more by not focusing on the "interesting" news. Maybe a source I'm not aware of? like SPAC news
I bought more calls when I should have sold mine for a 40% profit. Hope today is irrationally green.
They seem completely aimless in what they are trying to achieve that actually brings shareholder value. No one is gonna adopt a work from home virtual work place filled with a bunch of Miis from Nintendo.

Max returns is to invest in indexes and Roth max first, then after that play in gambling account. I got rid of all debt in my late 20s then went full bore ahead on retirement then saved enough  to when a bunch of play money for the stock market.
😳👉👈
Hahaha, thanks mate.
Yeah but i wait till berlin plant and keep just one call from profits.

If you be greedy then thats bad. Making 500 dollars to 20k makes me happy, if i lose 500 thats okay?
Have you tried a Strawberry Alarm Clock?
How much is Pelosi up on those TSLA calls at this point??
At a $57b market cap? GOEV with a $1.9b market cap is a much better play. It’s literally 1/30th of the value of Lucid.
What has my life become
It's my boomer account. Basically tracks SPY and outpaces the interest rates + inflation. Our debt to income ratio is fine. I'm not totally serious about being upset with her willingness to eliminate interest payments sooner. It's the kind of thing where I should probably sit down and figure out how to achieve max returns, but I'm making decent contributions and did raise them recently.
I too live in northern Virginia.

Yea, honestly I guess it's a fair play with fair reasoning. But i'll be cautious though. I remember losing 60% of my portfolio back in Feb 2020 on TSLA calls going through that sudden TSLA crash ~10minutes before close after being up bigly.

LCID up 7% pre market already, and it continues! Lol
&gt; VisualMod: The best thing to do is sell at the open. If you don't, your 35 cents will be worth 5 dollars in a few years and you'll have missed out on a huge opportunity
My 11/05 35c LCID already printing, should I sell at open or hold?
That doesn’t even make sense. They don’t test for that. And the only way to differentiate is if she was pregnant. She passed, brah.

Whether to pay off debts or invest wholly depends on interest rates. If you assume a low end return of 3% and a high end return of 8-9% on a low cost index fund and your debt interest is below those percentages you may better off investing in an index and slowly paying off debts to get the higher index return long term than paying the debt all off right way. Entirely depends on the amount of debt you have as well.
I made 3k to 48k just 3 days by market sentiment
I dont have 401k. my pension plan is die in climate wars or in natural disaster.
 rule 4 🤷🏻‍♂️
Yeah they do. But right now the money rotation to tesla is imminent for a while and momentum is strong on this.
*crosses arms* what’s your gains looking like lately sir?
nah big brain says blackberries are more expensive than apples so BB shld have larger market cap than AAPL
futures
I am, but she's still wanting to pay off debts and whatever 🌈 stuff we need. We have a safety net. I had to start putting my spending money into the brokerage account or she just spends it on making extra payments on debts if I leave it in there too long. We both make decent money and have excellent credit, but I really don't think we need to pay down debt as fast as she wants to.
My plan is to buy a 0.5% OTM Call/Put straddle at open.
Thats where you losing the exact concept of momentum trading.

Every big company rally will help smaller ones of same industries.

Just take couple of example how market reacted, MRK covid pill wiped 300 billion dollars from vaccine industries.

Meanwhile it helped keytruda sister company of mrk.

When tesla nuked, fsr and other evs nuked.

So amazon nuked affrm getting nuked.

Understanding market sentiment is very important for momentum trading.
Who in here is too scared to tell their partner/family about how much money they’ve lost and hope it just doesn’t come up?
Possibly
No, I don't like losing money and it's raining here 😭
Always inverse the MMs. Big MM players like Optiver and JS would be more than happy to sell you inflated prices on their options.
Wonder if people will buy the AMZN dip.  

AMZN is still considered undervalued by some analysts.

Watching Wolf Blitzer trying to play gotcha with Janet Yellen about inflation lasting 6 to 8 more months right now was hilarious. She schooled his SUNY Buffalo ass (my own alma mater) Wolf might as well work for the Daily Mail… there are jobs as restaurant cook that pay 25 an hour in Upstate Ny, and all Wolf can say well inflation is a tax on working people, will they be able to eat at Thanksgiving or have Christmas?
So got 10 XOM 65 calls expiring today (bought yesterday at the dip). Don't know if it will get there. Might have to sell at open.
Then why act smart by switching over put? Did you think it has to drop all of sudden you took profits?
Idk, the vol shows 0 in etrade. That might be just the ask

If Russian troops were sent to Cuba, there isn't a god damn thing we can do about it without starting an international incident, other than sanctions, which we already have. China will sit there and feign outrage for the virtue points they get to hold over us. They are just as reliant on the US and Taiwan as we are on Taiwan and China.
While you’re there, can you pick me up one of the sailor moon funko pops? If I remember correct he has like 8 sitting on his nightstand
LCID looking strong in premarket
&gt; I have a team of accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers that do my taxes for me.
Ah okay, thanks mate. How do you report everything tax wise, pain in the arse?
IBKR or Saxo.
My advice to everyone is to max your 401k.

this is like the most volatility in bonds ever
Technically AAPL is only down 1% from open yesterday.
It dropped 10k instantly when apple released earnings. Nvidia being a hero and recovering about 5k of it right now.
[deleted]
I paper handed my LCID call yesterday and reversed it into a put. Market open will tell the rest
Imo AAPL dip is going to get bought up right away, AMZN might tank further.
Stay loyal to the foil
This banks  named as a bad daddy’s girl
Just now.
they're not gonna do shit
It’s somewhat recession proof but it’s also moon proof. 

AAPL just trades flat. 

It’s a good investment for retirement funds. Super shitty for options plays.
Why not -3.5%?
$1.09 drop? That's it??? That's all you got spy?? Pathetic. Aapl and amzn dive off a cliff head first and you give me a measly $1.09 drop?

That’s called being a paper handed bitch…..

C’mon man
For real trying to decide if I should cash at open or just take another -20% swing today.
It's fun to make money.
Bro apple my qqq calls mate
He loves foot rubs and taint massages.
Upvote for pegging
We have troops in Taiwan because Taiwan asked us to be there. 

You know why Taiwan asked us to be there? Because China said they would take Taiwan back. 

So your analogy doesn’t work because it would be like China coming to defend Puerto Rico (which is already US territory) because Puerto Rico asked them to because the US said they’d invade it. 

Context fucking matters.
Never trust anyone named Wolf….. that’s my rule of thumb
Mostly meh.
Also, schools and colleges. Next time u take a science class you could actually look inside and dissect digital human body. 

You could learn history from Abraham Lincoln himself in digital form.
Nah, not yank.

Have a chat with their customer services (I mean, maybe they messed up in allowing me to trade options, but if not, hopefully they can sort you out with your access as well)

Best of luck
Wolf Blitzer is such a whore. Fuck him. He’s just saying made up shit rn.

Andy took over this past summer. It hasn’t even been 6 months. 

But since Andy is so recent I don’t think you can blame him for this anyway.

Hasn’t been 2 years and amazon is being run into the ground already lmao
Lol fucking this
I think it'll be a similar price for a about 5 years.

So do I sell my position at neutral and reposition for a better trade or just hold

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/sandpipa78 (2/1) made a bet that MRNA would go to 360.0 when it was 341.5 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Words too big
Brazil, going short in some BRZU, I missed the last pump but I am looking to enter when it reaches 75 again
AMZN bring back Bezos. Jassy trying to destroy the company.
Aapl is recession proof. Everyone uses shiny toys to feel less depressed about their pointless consumerist existence during down turns.
No
Euros may be poor but they are far more sexually advanced than ameririch
Hoping they don't.
They also made it seem like it was a sexual assault thing and they ignored the fact that he killed everyone's grandma during covid
Check in with IBKR settings or failing that, customer services, because I'm UK based and I buy and sell options with them on US stocks. You might just don't have it enabled

He must not be black
Oh who cares
Why do you think they called it the dark ages?
Green by open.  Probably
well, there are several reasons

1. excellent scam to part rich fools from their money 

2. it's basically like buying a painting, in that all art is kind of a scam

3. money laundering operation

Book it you nerds
Yea.

So what if nobody uses facebook or instagram in 5 years. FB (or MVRS?) just buys the next competing platform.
Get separated from your family at the border apparently, 450k from Uncle Sam for each of you.

Amazon flopped 2 earnings in a row, is this the end of Amazon? /s
Party of the process my guy
No way. Do you know how many people watched the meta video yesterday afternoon/night? My guess is FB gaps up and closes 5 to 7 dollars higher today.
Been building for over a decade in numerous communities on a concept he just takes the name claim on. It’s disgusting
#Ban Bet Won

/u/jsie-iaiqhsi816278 (3/3) made a bet that UVXY would go to 16.5 when it was 16.3 and it did, congrats autist.
And fight lawsuits, hackers, and advertisers afraid to touch it.
Apple just want that fat ad revenue.
downvote everything
[deleted]
Zuck wants to own web3, which is notorious for being decentralized. He’s desperate.
Why people scare of today spy going red? Yesterday SPY close at 0.98% green so today of SPY close at -0.50% it won’t matter.
***downvoter alert***!  
  

**Someone bought puts on TSLA**!
------
Coinbase end of year prediction? Im gunna say $400.
AAPL does this every damned earning cycle. You can set your watch to it. Your calls will be fine.
InflaRX !!! Gained 30% yesterday. And seems to have the potential to rise much more.
I still need a damn 10 banger before the end of the year to end up back to where I was earlier
I’m betting on puts
World govts can’t do shit to FB. US couldn’t do anything to FB. EU will not touch it since it announced 10000 jobs.

And Ads will be changed. U wont even notice if you are looking at an Ad. Think of visitng Timesquare in Metaverse. Except every billboards is showing products relevant to you. 

Instagram is not going anywhere for next 10 years. 

It doesn’t matter if people use Apple or Google products. What matter is where is the user engagement. U don’t stare at your iPhone home-screen all day. U either browse some kind of media or play games or talk to friends. 

1hour  a day user engagement is enough to sell ads to billion people.
LCID Yol0?
Good sign for my calls if you aint lying.
Ring ring hey your so loopy
If a guy likes the fat yet tight yet big asses of crossfit women is he gay?

SQQQ 0DTE calls today
My Lord why have you forsaken me?
Wtf everything just turned red
LCID babe plz cross 45 today 🙏
Any thong on calls?
I'm guessing he doubled down as recently as August, if not even later. I doubt he does calls like me, shares are a good safe bet
fucking premarket sucks so hard, just trying to buy AAPL at a discount and no one is selling
It’s like hey we want get sunk by Chinese defense when they invade Taiwan
🚨Rug Pull Alert🚨
Half of its users will still be using apple products for at least the next 10 years, and world governments as well as populations are beginning to despise Facebook.

People play animal crossing and games in general as an alternative to mindlessly looking at adverts on FB.
In the UK, can't play options.
Wait, where did you read that? Not that I'm doubting you, just didn't know that we have to add Mg to the list of disruption supplies.
Make sure to wear a mask and social distance
Buy the puts it’s part of their scheme
Oh lord, I'm praying for you guys with LCID puts.
Lmao downvoters 😂
MVIS obviously

Insane overreaction after yesterday’s EC. Inventory up almost ten fold, still best in class everything. This shit gonna reset. Probably a quick 10-15% return in one day. 

Then again, I’m down 70 fucjing thousand dollars so don’t eat my crayons
LCID pumping. Y’all better sell at pre market
I want harry potter world in metaverse !!
Lately they've been power hogs that barely match/beat amd's. Plus no cooler, plus expensive mandatory new mobo if you want to upgrade.
Imagine if Zuckerberg loses control of his own company that was supposed to connect people because he wants to create a fake VR universe where he can do Shibaru on fake oriental girls because Priscilla has self respect. Elon and Jeff have their Dick rockets to Mars, but Zuckerberg just wants to be able to virtually fuck “Lisa” from Boston U from 2005.
What about the magnesium alloy shortage? I just read that all the automakers in Europe will have to stop operations soon because they're running out of magnesium alloy to make the cars. What about TSLA? Do you know if they're also affected?

Fake and gay in volume.
Dwac pumpin

It would be fun if TSLA also went down 160 points like AMZN 🤑🤑🤑🤑
LCID running premarket again already.

I hate this stock. Wish I'd bought in earlier, now it feels too risky.

Every day it just screams what could've been. Fuck's sake.
Be warned, the current run is fake and gay in volume.
I'm feeling saucey my good man.  I think I'm gonna buy it.
A juicy put
Damn. Pfizer makes viagea too. .... Thats explaines some side effe t affect my shot. Ok. Going calls too.
😘💋👄
Suck 450k dicks at a dollar a pop
LCID ready for big moves today
U need to see the future. FB having a platform which it controls fully to sell ads. Metaverse will be highly successful. 

Look at animal crossing. Its kind of a 2D metaverse where people spend their time and do things. 
Now scale it to 3D with better graphics and huge user base and developer base trying to make new worlds for user engagement.
I haven’t seen booster approved but am imagining they will beat on earnings and revenue and will have positive guidance. I bought a few calls already.
Get my flair changed then fam.

Probably better off doing a long call on Barrick i mean boring in the sense there predictable and likely not going to jump on earnings, but personally k think gold is due to moon soon
[deleted]
Which is precisely why I think this likely will be successful. It's a huge market waiting to be tapped into. I'm not even taking into account the large amount of people that will make accounts just to troll Trump. One cannot deny the customer base will be there though. Management just needs to execute.
Meta verse is the lamest pitch I've ever seen. I hope it fails spectacularly
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
To guh or not to guh, that is the question.
Two more weeks it'll crash I promise
PROG - all should actually go in...so primed...
Its my second option play. I aint yolo eveything now. Yoloing everything and lose if finale not tutorial
Why do email scammers make spelling mistakes and write gibberish? To make sure they only get the most retarded people to answer and send their money.

Now, why does Elon Musk behave the way he does on Twitter?

Full diclosure: I am heavily short TSLA
Possibly 3 of the most boring/predictable earnings plays possible but I like Barrick it's due.
I was just lamenting the fact that no one told me about my mother since summer camp 4 days or so ago!    
  
**Thank you!**

As a bull, I'm going to try to include index puts in my game more often. I regret not playing some during September's peak. At worst, it's insurance. At best, it will make you survive longer and maybe make you ever more money than a permabull
I love crippling anxiety that makes you stay up until 4am

In the meta sounds like in the money now a days
They are usually so far OTM at expiration It's no worries
Your mom provides better simulation and stimulation mate.
Well it already started but hasn't completed. I think I should be good to go in 2 weeks or so. Would make it a total of 6 for me.
Calls on prog and rklb looking pretty good
So wrong of a strategy, but so right in this market.

How long does it take until nitrogen circle start and how big is your tank
Try jerking off. I'm serious.

You’re too old bro. That was the start
Just a small company inside Meta
Maybe invest in a scalpel company and a thread company to profit off all the thing being cut off and sewn on
How heavy are those bags my man?
Pumpa pumpa, pumpa pumpa, choo choo! Bring that trump n pump train this way baby oh fucking yeah!
Down $4 already
In the Meta, my trades are actually profitable
Tank and Stand was $250, Filter was $180, Light was $180, Plants were $130, Hardscape was $200, Fish so far $60 but I'm not at the point in the nitrogen cycle where I am going to add a lot of fish yet.

They did when it was like $80.  😆

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Big-Breadfruit-7243 (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1000.0 when it was 1061.01 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
I didn’t yolo. Would just spend around $500 on SPY calls every week for the last month. It just kept working 🤷‍♂️
The CCP is rumored to be demanding every citizen purchase a copy a toy story 3 to stimulate share price
So 500$ LEAP‘s are plausible for Meta?
You’re too young bro
I believe in a thing called GUH

Just listen to the rhythm of my heart

Go all in on short call for oil and gas but not past the winter
An open metaverse eats Zuck’s lunch. It’s a power move.
The 1st and 3rd largest components of SPY disappointed fantastically and we’re only down -.4%? Fake news.
Ok
There is gonna be huge demand for an alternative social media network that people don't feel they are being silenced on . I don't know if this will succeed though.  A lot of hurdles and enemies will exist against this one.
I honestly wish I had more balls and brains or less of both to be able to just yolo SPY calls
Lol
Based on Teslas current meme volatility index they are projected to reach 2200
What your next week earning plays? 

I thinking one of these

Moderna

Nintendo

Barrick.

But I am retired so I don't know.
Wait for it to bottom out, then make a decision. They found support before earnings. Now it’s a falling knife again
That time in society where every movie in the movie theaters had a 3D version of it. That time was golden not cause of the 3D but because of the time

Hopefully I do that, I try to time the market so much and hate myself for it.. been trading AMD since $70 but managed to only get a 20% profit
It was all meant to be a flex on China
NKLA puts are still down, someone should put that stock at the top of a hill
It’s the easiest app ever to make just a transparent layer on the screen
Makes sense, but I didn’t do that so that’s lame af
What’s the onlyfans link asking to support the cause
Sun.to for the W
Add tax on the taxes too
my phone at the lowest brightness is too bright
Honestly data tomorrow could shake off earnings woes a bit. If inflation is cooling off it'll be a good day. That said, it's probably up given the supply issue
I'm very skeptical of that play, last earnings amazon crushed it and dropped huge almost 300 pts, this was a huge miss with a worse outlook.. I'd expect it to drop below 3200
Watching CNN, Biden really undercut the French for those submarine contracts with the Aussies. Well no one wants fucking disel powered submarines. That’s the shit you give to the Indonesians and not a 1st World country like the Aussies….Perhaps we can work with the French to sell some of their Dassualt Aircraft to Oz. Oh well.

Found out my high school crush has an onlyfans today. Best investment decision I have ever made
You so funny!
well. if you can hold on through when it rockets up to $2000/share based on nothing but memes and retards FOMOing calls you are 100% guaranteed to make like 80% profit eventually
Fucking yourself is easy. Try with a real person sometime

Thing is, it will.  The frequent user base has an IQ of 2.4 combined.
Exciting times my boys!
Nah
And it still dipped the next day. (880 to 855, running to 1078 today)

fb beat.  touched 339 after hrs only to fade at open the next day and drop to 311.  Touched 325 today…
It'll be flat today just so it can screw over option plays. Probably pump on Monday

because it’s the theme of the mega caps earnings this season, started with nflx (617-&gt;674 today)

googl missed on er this week and rebounded 170 points the day after

shop missed yesterday morning (1288)  and rebounded 130 pts (closed at 1457 same day)

tsla missed last week, dipped to 855 and rebounded to 1078 today
They are starting to expand the deployment. That’s why you see this Reddit post.
You need to lose weight fam.. I've fucked in some really small showers.
Why so far out lmfao
This breaks my heart
Appreciate it. I didn’t throw a ton of money at them, I just remember what happend last earning with Apple/Amazon and figured it was worth a shot for a quick win

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/leadthemasses (0/1) made a bet that AMD would go to 130.0 when it was 120.97 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Just watched Cuckerburg's Meta reveal video. I swear it looks as though there's a prompter there to remind him to blink so he appears more human.
My shower isn't big enough 😩
Why, everything about earnings was bad except cloud. And outlook looks worse
Apparently I do it when I sleep too and it annoys ppl
it run 20% before earnings and news about the new intel chips not being shit (spoiler:they are) broke the day of earnings. Just increase your position and forget about it for a month.

I think RIO likes the weekly 200ma, seems like a support level..
&gt;Because he might be a billionaire now but he’s wasn’t before becoming potus.

That’s literally just false. I don’t know why you feel the need to lie to gain the upper hand in such a silly squabble. I mean, you’re the dude arguing a literally billionaire isn’t successful. 

However, let’s for the sake of argument grant you your first premise. Wouldn’t you, by your own admission, be wrong because he grew his wealth into becoming a billionaire? Let’s just say his plan all along was to grow his brand by becoming president… then succeeded and became a billionaire. At some point you have to admit he knows how to make money for fucks sake 😂. Seriously what are you even trying to argue here mate? 🤣
You're meeting the wrong blondes..

Well boy I finally did it. I was able to bring myself back to break even from down 85% all time by using just SPY calls. Now give me a play so I can lose it all over again.
Makes my wife’s boyfriend’s dick look big when he uses it to watch pornhub
Intellect says bearish, but instinct is advising me bullish.
beat or miss, it doesn’t matter. Facebook beat.  Hit 339 after hrs only to fade the next day to bottom out at 311 (breaking 320 and 315 support)

touched 325 today
I guess my spy calls are toast, exp today, hope 50% is saves
Exactly. Who wants to hold onto some loser, and who wouldn't want to buy the successful stocks?
Fair enough, gonna have to sell at a loss , prob just let me lose if it’s bloody in the morning

I feel like society is moving backwards sometimes. Before we were going towards you can do anything you want no matter what gender you are. Now it’s like if you don’t fit in the very specific boxes you’re the other gender and born in the wrong body. Like the whole idea seems to be based on sexist stereotypes of how genders should be.
Today I guess

Because he might be a billionaire now but he’s wasn’t before becoming potus. Also his dad and foreign banks have been bailing him out for decades. You should know this it’s pretty common knowledge but the fact that you don’t is typical from his supporters though so not very surprising.

Why would u buy 6000 dollars call?

Major chemistry bro.  I make her crack up every session.  I don't ask married women out.  If she made a move then let's go but otherwise I'm not an asshole.

Facebook doesn’t have a unique product anymore. Reddit does a better job of connecting humans than Facebook. No one in the long run wanted the whole world to know their name or to have their face tied to their opinion on something unless they were a politician. My guess is Reddit becomes the next big tech company to take the throne of Facebook.

Apple can easily create a social network to connect friends and family and that’s all people ever really wanted. Same with Samsung if they really wanted to or Android in general. Just need to make private social media integration that connects you to your family and friends baked into your phone to boot.
Why would a $FB 370 10/29 call be worth 132k at $700, when a $FB 370 11/26 call be worth 13K at $700.

Meta
All my stocks that dropped for less than I bought? I'm selling them.

Stocks that reached their all-time high? I'm buying them.
Tomorrow i guess
Dude…… you do know that for someone to become a billionaire they have to be successful more than they’re not…. right 😂? I don’t even know why you’re so passionate about this I just said I was excited to see how it pans out. Spend less time on Reddit or something.

If it’s shares, I’m pretty sure you’ll be fine, particularly in the long run (not that that phrase means anything here). If it’s calls, then maybe there’s a little cause for concern.

Hm? The dude is a billionaire and has the undying loyalty of nearly half the country. I’m sure this will *probably* be successful. Heck, people sick of the mainstream media like a lot of independents whom don’t necessarily like Trump might use the platform just to use something different from the norm.
When that happens sell a put against yours to lock in some profit. You can buy to close the next morning if it goes against you.

Cyberpunk future. It's the most realistic pathway we are on. Climate change, political instability, dead internet theory, covid. We're rapidly transforming into an entirely digital world. Everything will be linked by 2040 at this rate. 

Corporations like Facebook, Google, Amazon, ect they're not just too big to fail, they could survive on cash for years if need be. Think of how much information these corps have on us. Scary right? Everything you've ever typed. Ever watched. Ever done, recorded, shared, linked, stalked and that information could be held over you for years. Society would collapse if everyone's phone was leaked.

Kinda worried it’s gonna pump after what happened with Tesla, I was relieved when it went down after market and it ended up recovering. Also I was up like 50 percent on them and didn’t sell because I don’t wanna be put on buyer restriction so I lost all the gains for now. Really hoping I don’t kick myself tomorrow

**[Tulip mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania)** 
 
 &gt;Tulip mania (Dutch: tulpenmanie) was a period during the Dutch Golden Age when contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels, and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered to have been the first recorded speculative bubble or asset bubble in history. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a thitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis.

I kinda did this last year because my job was remote with very little parameters as to how we had to work, we just had to get work done. Some days were super difficult and exhausting. Other days I felt like I was scamming the world.  Do yourself a favor and get a routine going from day one. With that routine get you some YOU time. For me it was playing COD for 2-3 hours per night after the whole house was in bed. I was a little more groggy in the morning so there was some drawbacks, but I was able to feel like I got away from everything for a few hours. It made me feel less stressed when the kids were going nuts. You will defiantly become the go to parent if you do it for any length of time so be ready for that too.  I miss it more than I dont most days, but be ready for everyone of your friends to bust your balls about it more than likely in a good way. 

Thanks to that I was able to catch GME at 40$ as well so expect to do a lot more trading and you'll either burn your account or hopefully be able to get you a nice retirement.
That meadow background used to bring me so much peace.

So…. TSLA to $900 tomorrow? 🤔🤔🤔
I am covered in burns from welding and I lost control of my angle grinder and cut my thigh today. Not a bad day.
It’s too volatile (risky). Margin is basically borrowed money from Robinhood. So they don’t want to put themselves in a position where you are unable to pay them back
oof sorry man.. did you buy them recently? I was holding these for a few weeks. Definitely made the same mistake before as far as betting on a moonshot after earnings.

It just takes time, and luck. One of my biggest mistakes has been not holding options long enough and over trading, so for instance in this case and others i bought calls 5-6 weeks out with the intention of holding them about 2 weeks, 3 if its really on a roll. Just setting up some parameters like that has boosted my win rate quite a lot. I lost a ton last year all the time. 

Hope you can find some strategies that work for you!
That said, you can buy 20k in stocks and sell covered calls on them though.
Yes
It's a FINRA (I think) regulation. I think it's based sheerly on risk. Losing half your option value is daily life. Losing over half your stock value doesn't happen nearly as often.
So my calls are safe, hallelujah 🍆🥃😂
Yes sir yes sir 🙌
damn chipotle
Look at the spy put volume traded on Thursday. We will rally hard into close from covering for those who went short on Friday. This is it
Why aren’t you allowed to use it for options?
are you handsome or do you just have unwashed long hair
Why aren’t you allowed to use the 20k for options as well?
Pork belly futures.
In a simple man. I see dip, I buy FDs
Won my bet and added another, didn’t get shit, this shit is rigged 😂

it’s not, not all we’re created equal
So last day of the month we open violently down and stay there or does the FU sell off happen 15 minutes from close?
So if you have 10k in an account and add margin, you can buy 20k in stocks. You can only buy 10k in options still.

Okay VM is fucken strange.

If it’s this good at random convo, how long before there are hundreds of random bot accounts just responding to us for nothing more than a daily comment tracker?

I feel Reddit awards subs with monetary incentives for attracting users. Literally the YouTube model.

As long as the chat is active people stick around.

It’s a solid business model for Ad revenue no doubt and I’m not bashing it from an investors standpoint as Reddit IPO’s in Q1 22.

I don’t really care about the integration of life-like chat bots in large number just to keep the conversation going so the powers that be can mine off the community.

I just don’t want them to interfere with OUR chaotic conversations as the bots won’t offer real substance. Even if they sometimes randomly do.
It's only beneficial on stocks, not options, so it depends on what you trade.

Played $113p at the start of this week for earnings.   
  
Looking at the year, seems like they tend to dump at earnings and bounce back pretty quickly. I feel like a lot of the bearish article flooding could be your typical MM-propaganda, buuuut potential unions, raising staff minimum wage at their locations, closing otherwise profitable locations/restricting store hours from lack of staff, rising costs of coffee/paper goods/everything they sell, and their aggressive (temporarily expensive/potentially risky) move to open more stores internationally in the covid era - training staff, figuring out logistics, dealing with red tape, etc, make me feel like they aren't about to shit gold eggs in the next 3 months
  
I'm not saying don't buy the dip or expect a bounce up in a day or so, but personally, I wouldn't yolo.
Looks like Drill Team Six clocked in early.

Give me a position of yours. Genius like this is a rare find on this forum.
Yeah. Generally always want to disregard whatever they’re saying and take the opposite as the truth. When markets get red they bring on some ultra 🌈🧸 and say the markets headed lower don’t buy the dip. Usually within a day or so we hit a near term bottom and trend up. Same can be said when market rally’s a lot and they bring people on “oh it’s going much higher id keep buying”….you get the point. All their segments are garbage but I do watch a decent amount to see what narrative there trying to paint that day
They fumbled the bag too fuck

ADIDAS
I'm actually doing this as we speak I'm making a melee redguard pimp that just slaps. With mods you can actually box and slap shit around. Plus gravity glove mod. VR Skyrim is why I'm knee deep in FB calls. The name change is bullish too, day of.

It betta!
Wow that’s kinda shitty. New gf wen?

Will META go up now that Facebook rebranded
People that record themselves for social media are weird. Why can’t they just shitpost for degenerates like normal people
Seen this IRL. Was the cringiest thing ever.
If you do, you’ll go missing. Oh wait….shit one of there executives IS missing. Ruh roh.
15 years of smoking blunts leads to deep black shit you hack up all the time.

Ahh cancer, you will get me one day when I’m at my most vulnerable.

Or I’ll live forever. Probably the latter
Old school shorting

Meta reminds me of beta males

They call it Y-Charts because sometimes you just gotta ask "Why" right after seeing the chart
Like just how to navigate the search engine or what?

Okayyy dude. You got it
Yeah she’s fine, she’s got read receipts on to be extra petty and when I bought her her truck the dumb ass sales guy linked the connected services to my phone. She literally hasn’t left her parents house. She’s just being petty and won’t come home or talk to me until I apologize. Even though I dindu nuffin

Amzn and aapl money running to inflated TSLA. This casino 🤡
Guess my first question is: how?
It’s been a minute

Interest rates will hit 2% by January. Banks will front run tapering. Bye bye growth

Correct, only tax the gain or loss after the position is closed (even if you sell first)

My Amazon purchases have gone way down tbh. Do with this info what you wish
I thought they were crayons 🖍
Nobody is saying you’re bad for investing, working, or doing your best to get ahead financially and securely . r/antiwork is upset that labor is abused and not compensated appropriately, wages haven’t risen with inflation, and policy is designed that the richest don’t pay a fair share.

Do you mean actually shorting, or just buying puts? Because those aren’t the same thing.

Good idea long term. Personally, I trade the swings and this month’s run up looks overextended… would pick some up if it hit sub$110
They should be forced to report mid day.  That way retail doesn’t get bent over without being able to exit
Well done brother :)
Stick the flute far up enough, and you’ll have the answer to all your questions

Dear tax wizards, if I sell leaps and collect a heap of premium, is it taxable now or when the options expire?
I got to be honest man I'm kind of f****** losing it and trying to stay together in this f****** part of it but it's really hard it's really thin thin thin thin this with a string that I'm on I'm about to f****** blow man oh my God I can't find my shares

Get out on the curb and strut your stuff
Down, it always goes down after earnings. AAPL rakes in $100b profit, down. Everyone knows the best stocks don’t make money.
For sure. How are you making money tomorrow? Genuinely asking and not being a dick. 

Fwiw idgaf about fundamentals or any of that… I care much more about if I think there it’s more likely than not that whatever I buy will increase 30% in value in the next 90 seconds…
I have a ton of LEAPS (125-135 strikes for 2023) and a few hundred shares. actually sold $150 calls a month back against the shares and was getting ready to say farewell. I know you can sell calls against LEAPS too but just wanna leave those. was kind of looking forward to freeing up that cash to buy some new stuff that isn’t a 0-1 DTE FD

Petition to remove "equity yolos" from the allowed content in the guidelines.  
  
Half these posts aren't even plays anymore, it's just a bunch of uncomfortably poor narcissists who think people actually want to see a picture of nothing more than their boring ass portfolio. Even worse, we're so inundated with PnD stock cultists at this point that people actually upvote these shitposts because they help astroturf for whatever stock is featured.

An equity yolo is dropping a couple hundred thousand dollars on a biotech stock because you think they're about to get FDA approval, or at least to play earnings on a volatile stock. If you aren't getting assfucked by theta, or at least massively overlevered to collect theta, the guidlines should be way more strict on what posts are allowed.

Nvidia overvalued? Even SaaS are companies not selling for this multiple. Dayum
I made 15k from 5k doing this for 25 minutes today with LCID right before market close. 

I look for volume and options that have at least a 5minte pattern where they move at least 30% in a pattern range and try to buy a the dip and sell at the peak of that range… I hold my options for usually less than 3 minutes. 
… fwiw 3700% gains in one trade are just otm lotto tickets that printed overnight on unexpected news

Unlike most I make money, paper hand fast and repeatedly… in back to back trades 15 rounds trips in a day ain’t shit… and I cut losses instantly w stop market orders. 

I lost a metric shit ton chasing stupid bit gains earlier this year and realized it’s was better to make 2k x many times in a row with super fast trades.. than try to make every trade a 100%+ gain..  but you do you. 

I think these options will be moving with predictable fluctuation and a clear trend line where a dumb fuck like me can make 10k docking around at my desk at my real job… but you do you.

Dude are you nuts? 6 figs isn’t much at all. Shit even I make 6 figures. Lower end but if you count the figures it’s 6. It’s not an unreasonable claim by any stretch. 100k for anyone with even a bit of experience in a metro area is pretty standard. However it’s basically cost of living not extra income. Making 100k in a metro 20 is like making 50k in Bozeman Montana or twin falls Idaho or some place like that.

$WISH
 

Yes, the Wall Street expectations on $WISH
is VERY VERY low in Q3 with avg estimates around $360 to $370M. A BIG drop from Q2.

That said, William Blair gave $WISH a Neutral Ratings for Q2. We will bump the Ratings to BUY after Q3 Earnings.

As I said in previous posts, WE WILL BEAT 
$360M Wall Street avg expectations. I think we will have $435M in Q3.

Which means our stock will skyrocket to $15.
That is a BIG BEAT of Wall Street low expectations.

You are correct, I agree w/ you,  You don’t go from having a bad quarter posting $656 million to posting only $350 million the next quarter. 

But that is what is Wall Street thinks Wish will do in Q3 for $5. Obviously we will beat that at real ER of $435M


We will go to $15 in 2 weeks.
PCE core inflation numbers come out tomorrow
Definitely not 100% guaranteed. 

1099-Bs have a lot of stipulations and capital gains come from elsewhere, not reported.

Wouldn't "accidentally" leave anything off. Remember they can go back 7 years and pull all your financial records.

I hoping that DWAC 4% drop in afterhours means tomorrow it will resume drilling to sub $30 tomorrow and save my puts.

Why the fuck did I buy puts on F? 

I always say I'm not gonna buy puts and what do I do I buy puts. 🤡
I’ve never ever bought a put, but I’m tempted to because amd fucked me. It always goes down after earnings. You could fucking sell the moon and they’d act like you’re getting shuttered next week.
Sounds like something dude behind wendys dumpster would say

Good luck with your forgery.
Lol enjoy your ban
naw, exact number was 468k when it was around $38. made a google sheet with all of it, TP handed a lot of the early morning calls thinking it would consolidate or go down. got a total of 760 calls today on LCID, entering and exiting with 5-25% (a few went to 200%) profit.

I bought 5k shares yesterday AH cause I thought it would move up like ALGN but sold that shit in the morning after it went up .07 cents. Made a cool $500 but yeah fuck that stock

Not like this.
75 cents of your dollar to drop bombs on brown people that don't comb their hair.

$34,500
It's all relative. It shit was to get bad enough that I would consider it, $50 would prolly do the trick.
Figured, still tried to grab a titty during the pump. Lol
Sure, I can forge that real quick on excel
Perfect timing selling all my AAPL during the day’s run up, - look at that earnings drop
Nope 

Made it to the part where you said “six figure” and “career.”

They want the poor to think you’re rich so they’ll be satisfied when your income taxes go up while the billionaires continue paying measly capital gains

Gonna take my gains and buy a lucid rocket to the moon
It's more than that. I work in a supermarket business for 20 years and I have seen  anything like this, it may be product around but it's hard to get deliver to the stores not even at higher prices, all the warehouses in jersey and New York are missing tons of products and it happening to all the vendors like coka cola, unify, etc. One of my warehouse owns 100 trucks and only 40 is used because there is not drivers.
it was a discord pump and dump that people fell for
I hide it by owning a Rolex off of my yolo calls this past year

About to get ban betted so here my Chad Dickens

I have a six figure career and have had stable income for close to a decade.  I like to think I work hard for money and my job stability allows for relatively nice things. 

However,  I'm sick and tired of picking up the tab for the Poors. If being stable and middle class is something to strive for.  Why do I feel that the Government would rather give hand outs to the poor with middle class taxes? While we as a society can't find a solution for the top .01% to pay a fair tax.
Glad I never bought SDC shares. I only got a few call options. This stock got trashed like $Wish. One day everyone posting YOLOs buying 1000s of shares. The next day crickets.

We better open up low so I can reload before ATH.
It depends.  I called TDA and asked why MARA short puts you have to have all the cash available CSP but on everything else you don’t.  They use different ways to determine margin none of which is easy for me to translate into every trade.   Best bang for your buck (premium received vs margin required) is not a searchable filter.  Basically trial and error.  I’m heavy in a few good tickers liquid with lower margin requirements: HUT, OXY, DKNG a few I like
Oouch

Give me some insight so I have someone else to blame besides my impulsive behaviour. I feel like Tesla is going to keep rallying but some insight might help my decision making rn.
I tried a pupperoni once. Not bad
But it has the chief engineer of the Tesla Model S - so the guy who actually invented Elon’s car
I mean, if he’s still up from where he bought he probably doesn’t care. He’s looking at yearly averages unless something runs up so much he feels he needs to take profit.
So just a gun in your mouth?

&gt; No

I want to believe TSLA can get to 1100 tomorrow but I don't know if I'm brave enough to buy calls....
Yeah I know for sure they can happen…like if you take a loss on a stock trade and then trade the same stock in a Roth, the loss is not only a wash, it is PERMANENTLY disallowed. I.e. you can never recover it and the loss just evaporates into thin air, even if you don’t trade that stock for the 31 days. The big question is if the irs considers options as the same regardless of strike/exp. There isn’t anything concrete in the tax code so I think it’s basically up to interpretation and you just have to be ready to defend your position if they decide to audit.
trades not done on exchanges, it's when big players don't want their trade to move prices immediately

I think I made like 150k capital gains so far this year across two accounts, which includes a nasty GME wash sale(something like 20k).

&gt; I think you are referring to the dependent exemption. This is a tax deduction that allows taxpayers to deduct $4,050 for each person claimed as a dependent on their taxes in 2017 and 2018 (subject to change). The IRS has strict guidelines about who can be considered your dependents. You must provide more than half of their support during the year, they must live with you most of the time unless they're away at school or other temporary absences such as military service.

Hello Retard and Thanks.

I was doing some reading about reverse repos(RRP), and I see a few things I’m not quite grasping.

1. What rate is the current rate, for over night interest. I looked back at the transactions that are public(2 years old) and it shows 2.25%

[old repo data](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/omo_transaction_data#rrp)

[but this site has 0.25%](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/repo-agreement-ops-faq)

2. So say a RRP is bid, and Gold Sachs buys a security for 160billion. The next day its sold back. The Fed then pays the interest of .25% on 160billion???

So 400,000k the bank gets for lending the Fed liquidity?
Stop being an asshole con guy

Right there with you... Somehow I broke even on Shell but no clue how.
In an ideal world we basically would want to have real estate be a good investment but not too good that it prices out first time home buyers. Pretty hard to keep a free market and strike this balance
Shell did the same shit and fell from shitty earnings. I'm praying for XOM.
It’s gonna tumble down. This isn’t a drill but a tumble drill

The problem with most of the smoothbrains here is that they can’t read charts for shit and think just because a stock rallied for three days, it will continue doing so forever. If you don’t understand complex stuff, just look at the RSI, 3-month, 6-month. Anything over 85 is overbought territory. And TSLA is sitting at 93! It is way overbought, it will pullback for sure. Tomorrow could be that day 😏
Why not? Think we can still walk away with 10s of millions at least. These stories are gonna send it thru the roof

It's so surreal watching these 500x plays just pass right in front of you.
✈️
I’m not an expert but my understanding is the 3k limit is only the amount you can deduct in excess of any capital gains on the year. So you can deduct everything from your gains +3k. In your example I believe you would be able to deduct the entire capital gain from 2022 and still be left with a “surplus” of 37k in losses that are then carried over to next year
I’m right here pal
Meta….. don’t complain when the government teleports themselves into your home.
Tesla bills?
I think since everyone is expecting SPY to go down tomorrow, it might just do the opposite
face-sitting definitely helps
Assuming both the 100k loss from 2021 and the 60k gain in 2022 were short term.

You found the place
LCID is the move of the year.
Short goes with short, long goes with long. You need to pretty much match what type of gains you have with the types of losses you have.
No it dumped to hell for earnings

Meeses get it right or it gets the hose
u/aztraveler145, thank you for this! Been really needing some insight and not even the pros I talk to can help.

1) Can options with different strikes and/or expiration on the same underlying be considered “substantially identical”? Is there any kind of defined rules for how far apart strikes or expirations would have to be to be considered substantially identical or is it just a grey subjective area? I am trying to figure out if I created wash sales between regular brokerage accounts and a Roth IRA. Have some juicy losses I would hate to have permanently disallowed.

2) This one has to do with “Straddles” as the IRS defines them…I have a long term LEAP position that I want to temporarily reduce delta exposure on so I sell a higher strike on the same expiration to create a de facto debit spread. Eventually I want to regain full long delta exposure and the short call is down so I buy it back at a loss. Is that loss lumped in with the long call under the “straddle” rule or can I separate it out like you would with covered calls and claim it as a short term loss, separate from the long call gain? Important to note here the short call is usually ITM when sold…I’ve seen some rules related to covered calls that seem to make it easier to separate out calls sold as OTM but doesn’t extend the same benefit to ITM short calls

I know these are pretty specific complicated examples so don’t feel like you have to answer everything. Any info or points in the right direction would be helpful - I’m coming at this with 0 tax law background
WSB CPA [told me](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qhv990/comment/higrgam/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to give all my whores 1099s.

He’s got a point as far as manufactured consent. If all news outlets are saying “inflation” then you expect it. So companies can raise their prices a couple bucks and you expected it because the news said so.

u/AZtraveler145 Let’s say I have a 50k W2 income and a 100k trading loss this year. I know only 3k can be deducted from my taxable income every year. That means next year (2022) I’ll have 97k of trading losses that get carried over. If in 2022 I make 60k in short term trading gains will all of this be added to my W2 income and taxed with then 3k being deducted from that 97k loss that’s carried over? Or will that +60k just be used to reduce that 97k loss to 37k, after which 3k of it is used to reduce my taxable income?

Basically I’m wondering how trading losses from previous years get stacked with gains from the current year.

I agree that the name is lame and that zuck is weird as fuck, but he is not dumb…
We have had trade deficits the whole time we have been having record markets, literally for decades. What really matters is total amount of commerce, whether we are buying or selling really doesn't matter.
That’s actually a brilliant idea. I’m going to steal it.
Fubo sucks
FB is retarded the overlap between people who own and operate an oculus and those who actively use Facebook is none. On one hand you have young gamers and on the other schizophrenic geriatrics.

A few days later this girl got my number from my friend and started texting me. She then invited herself to come have drinks at my place next week when she's back in town. 

Funny how that works
Definitely late but the party can still go on. I’d only go for shares given how high IV is going to be at this point

Meta is to us what Amazon was to people in the early 2000s. The nobody would ever use that shit tech idea. And lo and behold, fifteen years from now 80% of people will be spending all their waking hours with helmets on their heads dumping government subsidy checks into Candy Crush Ultimate.

**[Diaper fetishism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaper_fetishism)** 
 
 &gt;Diaper fetishism, nappy fetishism or diaperism, is a type of garment fetish or paraphilic infantilism. A person with a diaper fetish derives pleasure from the diaper and/or use of it. Being forced to wear diapers as a form of humiliation was sometimes a behavior encountered in sexual masochism according to the DSM-IV, but any reference to diaper fetishism has been removed in the DSM-5. As of September 2015, Huffington Post Arts &amp; Culture published an interview on diaper fetishes that was widely regarded as informative within the community.

I bought $1700 worth because I’m a retard and now it’s worth $5400. Isn’t this the point of the casino?
Yeah probably. We'll see what happens when the fed actually starts tapering. Could be a pretty flat to slightly down next few months.

Wait, Tesla makes cars? I thought they were just a far OTM call company
I swear to God the other day in some LinkedIn group this guy posted a screenshot of him and his buddy’s convo bragging about closing a deal. But they were calling each other c*suckers and F****ts in text msgs 😂
This is the way I see it, and keep in mind I'm definitely retarded. There's no way they let SPY crash until all the stuff from 2020 is sorted. You have china on one leg, your biggest threat, now is the time to ramp up the financial reigns and get everyone fully invested. 1920s style. When the poor start becoming rich too fast they rugpull, and I'm still poor. Calls are safe.
Retards did I say I was buying calls I'm just gonna buy stock/sell outs and hold this long term
Yeah it’ll happen .
Yup it's coming back to 140 for SURE. Maybe even 137 by Nov. We've seen this movie at least 4 times before

Sorry.  They are tapering next week.  I thought it was priced in but given how many people still don’t believe it I think the market is gonna get hit hard
talking about shibu, I had 5 dollars left in webull a couple of months back, I couldn't be bothered withdrawing it so I bought 900,000+ shibu coins with that 5 bucks. I go look today and it was worth upwards of 80 dollars

I'm going to leave it in there to see which account gets to 1 million first, my robinhood options account or that 5 dollars shibu account

You’re welcome.
I am loaded to the tits on calls and shares. Diamond handing these fuckers through earnings
It's put time. The time for calls was 24 to 48 hours ago
Buy weeklies then try again next week. Repeat forever
Just checked RVLV for puts for next week, holy shit the premium on that company is retarded…..
Price has a long way to go to get to Tesla at $1000 a share - cheap in comparison!
Yeah but why is it a big deal

Just want to let everyone know, apple and amazon are going green tomorrow. Their losses are TrANsiToRY
Good thing I bought a bunch of RBLX right before their servers die. This will go well for me tomorrow I'm sure.
And it will go back up and stay around 150$
But 1billions of dips would make you a LOT OF MONEY
&gt; Yeah, I like the song.
About 5% of Tesla’s market cap. What a steal!
They rarely buy through affirm? Dude, it’s been live for 1 fucking day
You shoulda bought it earlier this week
Because they produce such a limited quantity that most dealers only get ~5x of the desirable models per year.
Sept is the pullback, not nov/dec

since I got my Amazon RSUs in March of this year I'm up 80k doing the same shit (although I played Google for the first time 1 month ago and it paid off yesterday, I got out for 35k profit on my 3 January calls)

I will stick to Amazon and Google from now on, none of those bullshit meme stocks I kept losing money on all last year
Bulls made so much money last few weeks. A red day will be good for their ego
Shhh don’t tell them..a new bagholder is born every minute

i was a data scientist for a few years at a big company and the model you're talking about is too noisy, takes a team of people, massive amounts of data, insane compute power, etc. i need my own personal bull shit detector, a YoloAlgo algo.

I'm not but there might be a good entry here. With a price this low, an acquisition could become a realistic possibility. Besides, meme hype has a way of respawning now and again. Still a gamble, of course.

It’s about not having the added stress on your body which weakens your immune system, giving your body the rest it needs to recover, and also not being inconvenienced by not having necessities as soon as possible like warm soups, a bathroom to shit or puke in an excessive amount of time, a heating pad, ice packs, teas, etc

You don’t have to be in it, but understand. Seek why. 

It will help you w the broader market and plays. 

It is about tech. Being the first mover. Ramping. Scaling. 

People believe in it. They want to own it it. Be a part of it. Own one. Even people that made a shit pile of money on it still hold onto their shares. Even during all the downs. 

And so much more. All I am saying is, instead of saying it is stupid, learn why it is not.

Annoyed on Amazon. They charge me $57 on something I don’t know. Customer service don’t want to refund

Damn you got the rona? Should've gotten vaccinated.

These ones are nice and red. They might even turn green, but they are so steadily red right now that the perma bulls are feeling a certain kind of way that makes them really uncomfortable. Like when they go to the gym and they're in the locker room kind of way. They see things they think they don't want to see. The impossible becomes possible. The hard truth is penetrating their defenses. They feel naked. Vulnerable.
Back to NAV
I expected more shitposting about metaverse in the top comments when I got here... Well, another fuck you to Bezos. Almost as big of a sack of shit as zuck, maybe equal 😡
It will be Black Friday, but not in the way you meant it.

The market sentiment is strongly positive toward TSLA this week and we are just riding the wave. It also broke thru technical resistance it hit on Tuesday and it’s just the type of stock that often has wild volatile moves.

Fun fact if you spread $10,000 across all 6,000 cryptocurrencies in early 2020 you would have over $1,000,000,000 today
Don’t really pay attention, but you do
LOL
These companies are all huge and most funds own them. Institutions don't day trade. When these stocks dip, they buy. Also, these companies have huge buyback budgets and these dips are a gift to them. These misses are small and these companies are still making billions per quarter. Investors understand that any sales AAPL didn't make this quarter will be made next quarter.
Don’t mind if you do
I'm sure he does. Just because he hit the mother of all home runs, doesn't mean he doesn't have the bug. He just can take on bigger positions.

I mean, if it comes down to that yeah, but mostly just to clean it up down there. Its like a fucking jungle rn

Amazon Prime Fresh: Now In-stock - Magma
First hour mega pump postponed indefinitely. Temporarily replaced with day long mega dump. We apologize for any inconvenience.
You are one sick fuck.
The after hours thread might actually be better than the daily thread. This place is a fuckin hoot
That would be swell
So like, we got 2.0% instead of 2.8% gdp ( a -28% miss). Now we have the big corps missing their earnings bigly AND cutting down on the forecast. One of them is so underwater with the public they chose to fucking rebrand their name.

And yet, spy and qqq still sit at at the top. When people ask 'why did stock tank after beating earnings' most smartasses answer 'cause market is forward looking, the guidance matters more'. Ok genius, now what about when there are literally ONLY negative news floating around and stonks still go up? What's your explanation for this?

Nothing makes fucking sense holy shit

Probably cause work ends whenever the workday ends. Home doesn’t end until everything’s done. You can look forward to heading home from work and it’s someone else’s problem til you’re on again. Home, everything’s got your name on it.

Buying AAPL, hopefully take advantage of volatility at the open to get a sweet low price. Figuring out my limit price rn
Pro Tip

If you buy stock you might make a profit
It seems to me that shorting DWAC is better than buying puts. 

Benefits: no time constraint, no IV crush… &amp; puts are really expensive!

I’ve never shorted a stock before. I understand the downside is the loses can be higher if the stock climbs higher. 

Thoughts?

I think the answer to this slowing growth is more health mandates to eliminate more of the work force.

I joke about the rebranding but it's obvious their focus is on addressing future markets in whatever the metaverse is gonna be esp since they are segmenting out reality labs $

If market thinks this brings about new addressable market for ad dollars then the money will come.

No u
My opinion, no. Others may vary. You decide.
Yeah it STINGs.
we will clap bull cheeks together 💪
The more time you spend in Casino the more you'll loss and the more experience you gain
I have a bad feeling about that too, but I think we’ll probably be ok. if it gaps up then I’m taking profits at open. I’ll be working so that means a bathroom break at 9:30 sharp lmao.

WSB is no different; say they're about money, but avoid it because it somehow means associating with Mango in some way. They have no problem YOLOing into the dumbest shit like CLOV, but an obvious gain like DWAC is a no-go while calling everyone else cowards for not buying Calls on Robinhood?

The charts for this week mimic the lead up to the March dip. Probably means nothing though.
Way to state the obvious
Wdc down 10%after hours. They just shot the stock in the head holy shit. They just cold blooded took it out. That sick son of a bitch
What even is it
SE Asia, child labor laws are pretty lax there so you can put the kid to work pretty early and make decent money
Imo you have balls to be buying for 2023 because a if a bear market strikes could tear everything down. And then it could even take years to get back to neutral again
There's a country song about this

Can anybody explain to me how Apple earns so much fucking money and still has so much debt?
Ahh I know how you feel.  Last year I moved 3 times just because of shitty upstair and downstair neighbours. 

Upstair one was walking in the house non stop. Like constant walking. Even at 2-3 am. His foot steps were waking me up. Since I can say "dont walk" I broke my lease and left because it was making me insane.

On my new apartment, this time downstair neighbour was problematic. They were partying and loud talking/yelling/singing 24/7. I called cops on them twice because they never stopped even though I asked them politely many times.  Once I got the police reports, they were tamed and kept it reasonable but still loud. I moved out on my 9th month and leasing office didn't charge me the remaning because of police reports.

Now I live in a place that is so quiet. This is my last apartment before I buy my house. I feel like I suffered enough and now this quiet place is my reward. Good luck on your apartment. I hope you find a way out.
Is there a formula or a calculator to price option limits? If I want to buy a call when stock price hits 100 and it's at 105 rn for example?

Hard to say. My point was more to the fact that anyone looking to buy an AAPL dip should have done it a couple weeks ago at $138 - not now. Any smart/big money did. That was the "tasty dip."

That's good, right? Knocking it down. Getting it under control.
As it should. You don’t do a stock split and then start missing on revenue or they’ll ask you who do you think you are. FB did share buyback and still got wrecked, so Apple should get slaughtered

You are correct Sir, we are in a economic contraction that cannot be stopped. 1.2 million unemployed each month, only 290k new jobs.
You should come out with a book with all these life hacks and pro tips so I don’t have to dig through your timeline every time I want to level up. That way it’s just all there in one place.
Probably get Tsla Puts then cash out and load up on TSLA calls EOD 

Market makers are in all likely hood going to start selling off their hedges tomorrow then the pump continues Monday 🥰

That’s my plan tomorrow
And people don't understand why other people go live in rural areas? Okay.
Well in that case I will send her over when i am done.

Thanks. My wife is due in March.
That's actually an observed phenomenon. Confidence goes down the more research people do and the more experience they get in this, which means the plays take on structure, but the market is irrational so random distributions often work better... LOL Or alternatively playing the same exact play over and over again with a high enough hit/profit rate with only stopping when the pattern and odds change.
Bears love making expensive dinner reservations for when the wife finally comes back home

Yes sir. I don’t want no trouble. Next thing I know you &amp; your crew of unhinged reactionaries will alert your proud girl street gang to come put a hit on me. Can’t think of anything more scarier then a bunch of illiterate fat toothless hillbillies wanting smoke with me.

Absolutely brutal. I had that happen a few times recently. It’s gutting
TLDR
Women always value safety over freedom. And they value smooth round things that they can lube up and stick in their ass. That's why teslas look like that. You think I'm kidding but I'm not at all.
Im sorry I have a conscious and don't wanns con people out of money
No promises.
Nah SPY will pump until 2pm then crash into weekend. Green futures monday morning and blood red the rest of next week
Yep, probably at 0 by Christmas.

Tagging you as "Do the opposite of this guy"
Ey yo call the mods
Holy fuck the MVIS sub is depressing as shit.  


I love it.
They don’t own network for PayPal and Venmo transactions. They don’t own network in China and in India. 

Money flowing through their network will decrease with time as more wallet to wallet services become available. To offset losses they will increase their fees on per dollar processed which will in turn fuel more business to move away from them.

Strangest thing. I was in Italy this month and at Rome Termini train station it must have been a fucking 2 hour wait for the five guys line from how long it was. I couldn’t believe it. Of all the things to eat in Italy. I never even eat there here. I couldn’t believe how desirable it seemed to be to the Italians. Blew my mind.

It will break tomorrow for normies

The thing is, you can make much more money on other plays rather than hold something like that.
If you go saltwater you have two choices for water changes: Invest in a reverse osmosis water filter and mix your own saltwater. Or go to the shop and buy premixed RO water from them. If you use tap water in a saltwater tank you will have algae blooms like a mother fucker.

Might never get passed honestly. Progressive caucus won’t vote yes until the reconciliation bill passes the senate, and the bill the senate put forth today basically cuts out all progressive’s priorities so they might vote no on both if reconciliation passes the senate in its current form. Hell Bernie might stop reconciliation from passing senate because the current bill scrapped Medicare reforms which he said were his bottom line must have.

I’ve had two 55 gallon saltwater tanks. Pieced everything together instead of buying kits and probably spent 3-4k each including fish.

Visa bankrupt?
Praying and preying are very different things. Wait, on second thought, you may have a point.
AAPL was thrown up
Your*
Fresh or salt? After initial set up it’s fairly inexpensive unless you change plants, buy different fish, upgrade tanks. I’ve got a 2 55 gallon fresh tanks, one for tropical and the other has a some goldfish(I upgrade the tank size as they get bigger don’t worry) and my only real costs is food, water for changes, and electric for lighting and heating

The pre 2022 models will keep their value for a whole. The new ones are ass
What do y’all think about Redbox? Sht feels like GME yet no ones talkin about it. Old physical play that is going digital and recreating their services.
$XSPA...40% short volume, 60% Dark Pool, beaten down badly, yet testing passengers everyday at 14 locations and International travel opening back up in 1 week
I can smell you from here.
Any chance fb goes to $427 tomorrow?
why buy calls when you can sell them?
Is this Halloween?
I have bought 2 pairs of yeezys off goat and now you have me 👀👀

There are so many better places you need to go to if visiting
Gonna be a good one for tax harvest. Same goes for TMC, CLOV ect....
Yea unfortunately Subaru hasn’t dont much in terms of upgrading their engine.

Why did AMZN and AAPL crash AH?
Where would Five guys fit in?
If losing 400 dollars is life changing then you are gutterbound friend.

The hope you give me in the evenings allows me to sleep.   I still end up fk'd the next day but my spy 460's i bought at close thank you....
Gonna open above 1100 bro.  Apple and AMZN sellers will need a new home.

MAANG!!!!!
Can you change my flair to something more retarded please.
whoever into fish tank? this shit is expensive. I set up a nano 5 gallon tank in my home office and spent like $350 on tank, light, filter, heater, and some plants. With fish and shrimps, it was almost $500...
&gt; Yes, it's going to be all right.
Yeah the rug pull was yesterday lol

Yeah but rebranding it won’t bring in more $$$.  I don’t care what they call it, they still need to make money.
It’s a good car, don’t get me wrong. It’s just nowhere near as quick as you expect it to be. I was honestly pretty let down driving an STI limited recently. I expected much more.

But if compact, awd, and affordable is what you’re after it WILL check all those boxes and more. And it WILL be a fun car. Especially if it ever snows where you’re at.
QQQ
They reminded everyone that they don't have a product or revenue
That’s awesome glad you like it. Enjoy student life while it lasts ha. Meh just life stuff. Been sick, been slacking at work. I will get out of it no worries. Good luck w everything!
Rebranding always works bc Americans have bad memories
No v is sooo cheap. Borders are opening
Insta becoming TAINT
Hey, wait. Does the Facebook name change mean Cramer will have to stop saying FAANG? Cuz, that would be great.

V calls, and SPY puts for tomorrow....i think im retarded
People rarely buy things on Amazon through Affirm, if it’s already going on a credit card there’s no reason to make multiple payments for a fairly cheap item (most orders are &lt;$100)

Raising Canes
Ah. You bought calls before earnings too I see
Nah, AAPL will recover tomorrow AM, maybe even Pre-market.
School is nice, materials science is very interesting! Feels weird not having to go to work though, life is way different from before! What rut are you going through?
Apple in the aggregate. Prolly Facebook as a % of assets
So when is this infrastructure shit getting voted on?
What index has the most high growth stocks?
We just did that with Amazon and lost
Just realized cardinals are 7-0 da fuucck
We all agree
Just a smidge
I only skip on days I'm depressed. So like 3 days a week.
Gonna start selling naked TSLA puts again tomorrow.
You should hurry and trademark that before it’s to late.
Popeyes Wendy’s are best tasting especially if you get a good fresh order. Chick fil a is the best quality chicken. Taco Bell is the best drunk high food
Your girl’s boyfriend does too 💁‍♂️

I'm going to be BIG sad if I'm not a millionaire post tax before the MOAC. After the crash there won't be crazy shit like mango stock going up 1500x in a day or retarded plays where companies with the word meta is getting pumped because of facebook
I missed you too man, how’s life treating ya?
tomorrow could possibly hit 40 . You have leaps for the EV market . You should be safe
Pfft..speak for yourself dumbass. I already bought the top today 😎🔫

We are here too.
Yes I am lol. My bad
AMZN reported $110b in sales this last quarter.... Let that soak in for AFRM investors.... For context, Peloton accounted for over 20% of AFRM's total revenue, which is around $174m for the year.  


Affirm has not allocated ANY guidance w/ not only Amazon, but Walmart, Target &amp; American Airlines.   


Their growth is going to look INSANE

What’s the best out of Taco Bell / Wendy’s / Popeyes / McDonald’s / Burger King / KFC / Chick FilA

Yup. Bought last week. Went down so hard after earnings wasn’t even worth my while selling them. Decided I’d hold the worthless POS as a reminder to stop with the earnings plays. Even when I try to inverse my instinct it’s still fucking wrong. 330c
Your balls are going to fall off
I want 200
Funny watching you cry about loosing only $500 earlier yet being the same cum stain that posts your poor pasta. Just remember you’re the bully and I’m the bully of the bullies bitch.

Sold LCID. Picked up TWLO, TMUS, DAL, &amp; UBER.

New targets are Z, CPNG, &amp; COIN to reinitiate previous positions.

And if AMZN goes below $3,000 I'm selling your first born to get some.
Truth hurts sometimes
i knew i should have fucking bought amazon and apple puts at close. i hate my pussyness sometimes
I got 100 shares at a $70 cost basis. You saying I should double down?

For some reason I always thought you and memetron knew each other irl
Oh look my fan club book keeper coming to check up on me for the 10th time this week. How’s my favorite bully of the poors doing today? You still to pussy to take that bet that you’re the real poor between us 2? It’s only a stack
I saw your tiny rat PP
Not gonna lie, remy was really good at licking that peanut butter off my bung hole
So with that entry point exiting isn’t such a big deal I’m up like 17-18% its my second largest position behind alphabet. To be honest I made some gains with gme and just put the money in stuff I thought would tank till I figured out this whole stocks thing 😆
First ones free.

Not a great entry point. This is a tough one. It still has upward momentum. I don't think it's going down much less than 40-50. And 120 is high. I think it might live between 60-80 with some pretty big spikes and dips.

Yeah its called free money, and why the fuck are you telling everyone
Think so. But it wouldn’t be a profit because of the premium.
Facebook actually changed its name/ticker so the extended tech acronym wasn't FAGMAN anymore. This political correctness is getting out of hand smh
You trying to take axman’s place on top bull?
Stop buying far out of the money unless it's lottery ticket money you're buying with. The majority of your options should be long-dated at- or in-the-money calls.

Yeah, but it's more complex than that, I was just using those numbers to show how much bigger companies are now by revenue/earnings than 20-25 years ago.
It's a lot more than just an inflation sized increase.

And the potential markets for these companies is 10x as big.  Virtually no US companies had substantial revenue operations overseas back then.  Maybe Coca Cola is really all I can think of...

Now? Big Tech has huge revenue streams overseas.  Places like Europe/Asia pump tons of money into them.

So their potential economy is $100 trillion GDP instead of just the 1999 US GDP of $8-10 trillion.

Yup, we're headed up and the ticker change on Dec 1st will be a major catalyst.
I got $50 on it
Ok, I have yet to really see a pick spike in price. Got in on the dip around 120. Not sure how great an entry point that was. But I had no money before GME haha. What news sent it majorly upward last ?
Damn sorry to hear that, take care of yourself!
I think so.  Or playing chicken.

Well u/Historical-Egg3243 gotta say you were correct. To the T. I’m glad I made bets accordingly
I had to work today. Had in a bid before I went in to buy tqqq 145 calls for 3.80. Apparently they started at 4 and never went down so I didn’t get any….. by the time I checked on them on my break they were at 7 and ended around 8. Made me sick I could have made more money than I had made all week with double overtime if I had just stayed home

Is it just me, or does the MVRS ticker feel kind of… I dunno, generic? MVST, MVIS, MSFT… I guess there are just a lot of tickers that look visually similar, and I’m not sure I have enough brain cells to read past the first letter.
That’s a solid play right there.
The other 51. 😉
I feel ya. Sold too early too.
Oh let me rephrase. I bought calls yesterday and it dipped so if I buy more tomorrow it will dip

I am not sure if I am wiser but...Any news - any mention from certain people can send this one in to orbit for a few hours or day. 

My feeling is if you are long and assuming a decent entry point keep an eye on it and if it moons sell off a portion. It will most certainly drop back so if you want to stay long you can buy back in with gains. 

Maybe look at GME's performance late Jan-Feb to see how this might react.
revenue growth deceleration
Good looking gal
Sounds like the former. I think they’re trying to make it so they can expand their focus to more and more things beyond the social media site itself.

MNTV closed at $25 and was offered $28 worth of Zendesk shares at Zendesk closing price (0.225 share ratio).

Zendesk fell 20% after hours... so now MNTV is also down 10% after hours.  When was the last time a merger announcement tanked the potential acquired company's stock...?

Merger may be cancelled by tomorrow... never seen such a situation where the potentially acquired company falls so hard too.

Or a win cuts your ban shorter by a day. Won 4 bets in a row then lose? 3 day ban. Conversely if you go on a streak of losses each loss adds a day. Lose 1, get a 7 day ban. 2nd loss in a row, that's 8 days.

It's.... not just cooking and cleaning lol. When the children are infants it usually falls on the mother to take care of them 24/7 and be sleep deprived while doing so. Even when they grow slightly older, they are usually the ones driving the kids to various things, taking care of meals, cleaning, my mother did our finances as well. Not to mention the isolation that a lot of stay at home mom's feel. They don't get to just go to work and be with their buddies all day. When 78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, do you really think they have the means to hire someone for cooking and cleaning? Respect the women in your life. Motherless behavior.
Well duh, they have to rearrange their boxes

Don't forget, these analysts get paid major bucks by their respective firms to do research on any given sector. If their estimates are off, it means that billions in client funds might be at risk. So, they have to ensure that they aren't too high or too low, because it could make future clients less likely to go with them.

We have a similar situation. I’ve held Apple for a couple years and it’s been great. I never play Apple options because it’s difficult to predict in the short term but it grows steady. You know the old Buffet strategy “never sell your winners” but it’s hard not to look around in this bull market. Earnings weren’t even that bad either lmao.
How'd you get early tickets to the metaverse? Zuck, are you trying to cuck?
Are you still slanging packages at the Amazon warehouse? Bad night for you guys.
Oh
Fine. But you're paying for the car rental

Remember everyone, all this inflation means companies charge more for their products and services which means higher growth rate and higher stock prices

Look there's no need to argue the bull or bear case. The forces that will prove that right or wrong are already being played out. We've been in tightening since unemployment benefits ended in September. Tapering is another way of saying tightening liquidity. Same with rate hikes. Either this will pop it or it won't, but the forces are in motion either way.

Bullish as we now have infrastructure bill hopes
I genuinely think the “FB is renaming as a distraction from bad PR” angle is the absolute wrong take. 

They’re moving *beyond* the social media platform. Seems bullish to me. 

They’re not renaming as a distraction, they’re renaming because they view the social media platform Facebook as a distraction from the goals of their company.
25%
no literally nobody has watched Breaking Bad
I know, that’s literally how I identify which people in this sub are dumb af and broke because of stubbornness. I ain’t waiving the “only goes up” flag BS… all I’m saying is it takes a very specific type of stupid to consistently bet against the most insane, never-ending bull market in history that everyone agrees is nonsensical but everyone’s making money so who gives af.. and yet for over a year they get up in the morning and still convince themselves to their 2% success rate is the way to go.  I’m just saying.. if someone wanted to get into politics I think there’d be an overwhelming amount of support to bring back  the guillotine.. it was invented for a reason, and the public showed up to cheer every single time. Plus the billions you’d save instead of putting them on death row for 25 years first. #balancethebudet

The thing is, don't think about a bubble in terms of what you can see. Think about what's beneath the surface. Risk is building in ways that we aren't clued into. Some people a small number see what is happening, but like in the 2008 crash it wasn't obvious the enormous risk that had built up in hidden ways throughout the system. That's the danger, loose liquidity always causes a massive increase in risktaking. Right now it isn't obvious what is the thermonuclear weapon. When liquidity tightens, it will be.

I was ~~thinking~~ apeing about it all week
Is it true that visual bot is gonna be removed? Thought I saw zjz mention it the other day
For those that think we're in a bubble, ponder these numbers:

GE in the year 1999 produced $10 billion in profit on $100 billion in revenue for the whole year.  Its market cap was $500 billion at the height of the market euphoria.

AAPL in the 3rd quarter of 2021 produced $20 billion in profit on $80 billion in revenue for a single quarter.  Its market cap is $2.4 trillion.

This is why we're probably not in a bubble (yet).  Revenue and earnings have grown to a scale that probably could have never been imagined back in the last 90s.

Much of the valuations was just hot air and hype back then, GE had solid revenue/earnings (probably the most solid of the big caps in 1999), but most didn't.

Just worth considering that times have changed substantially; big cap tech especially operates at a scale that makes GE back in 1999 look tiny.
Tard strength is real, in 5th grade we had this kid  who was like only half tard. Ya know not quite special Ed material but he’s halfway there. Anyway he picked up a desk and threw it across the classroom at the teacher. Didn’t see him again for awhile after that

Said he's been holding for last 3 months and it's been tough and sounds like he's gonna hold until he lose it all

TDOC doom and gloomers from last night, I told you that yesterday's AH crash was not the final word. I had no idea today would flip last night's response to such an extent though. A very good day for TDOC, I sold 2 of 5 calls for safety, hope the other 3 can continue climbing so I can regain more of what I lost on TDOC this year
You mean Amazon the book company? And doesn’t Apple make some discman thing?
First time Apple missed in 5 years. Brace yourself.
Alright I’ll take $100. Never bet against Tesla.

No, they haven't been served.

The SFC (guys behind the code) said they're investigating it and will seek legal counseling. Nothing has been served. Just got through talking to a dude about this and read the SFC's website for myself. Nothing says they've been served anything.

I think this is just being blown up, like everything else that Mango does that doesn't matter. This whole thing falls apart if he just posts the code. It's stupid and a waste of time.
The point is that last quarter’s earnings season was completely carried by these big tech companies (look at the graph of tech from June to July), whilst the majority of tech stocks were battered and even below their 50 DMA. Now the big boys faltered

It’s the taking it in the ass that makes me think twice
Look here's the thing, the party goes until it stops. People are all in because they believe prices will go up. Look at China and Evergrande. It only took one developer to bring all these other defaults out of the woodwork. Defaults no one, not even the Chinese government was expecting. Forget earning, think of herd psychologically. The market is collective psychology. In a club, everyone is going to party like it's the last night of their life until they see the fire rushing to them. Then they stampede for the exits crushing whoever is in front of them. It's gonna hit bubble names and good values all the same that how most bubbles in the US end.
&gt; I'm not worried about Amazon. I think it's a great company and is undervalued at this point

none of that was surprising tho....apple's supply chain issues are well known, rising labor hurt amazon, and facebook was hurt by apple privacy changes. they said all this during the last earnings.
I don’t know man, AAPL has a kink for edging 150.
They are printing money like fucking crazy, "muh collapse" isn't going to happen.

What is the indication at open that a stock going to keep going up as opposed to the usual bull trap ?
I'd agree that certain names are trading at bubble-ish valuations, but I don't think all or most are.

There's just been an insane rush to pump money into equities on a scale never before seen over the past 2 years.

But most of that money was already there on the sidelines; most people just weren't buying equities.

Think about how many people own TSLA stock that never owned stocks before.  Or pick any other name that's done well the past 2 years.

And the one critical difference is earnings.  MSFT/AAPL/AMZN/GOOG/FB are producing revenue/earnings numbers that we've literally never seen before.

AAPL's quarterly profit was $20 billion.  That's probably more than any company had in an entire year in 1999 back when the top valued company was $600 billion market cap.

So the revenue/earnings numbers are there for much higher valuations now.

Of course some valuations are still ridiculous like TSLA, GME, AMC, etc.
What makes you think it’ll be more red
It sounds like you are saying the top is artisan non-chain American coffee places and Italian places that cater to tourists, and that Starbucks is mid-level coffee, better than ordinary Joe shops, but not as good as shops that take their time to make a cup that has been slaved over.

It's not always easy to appreciate the differences, just like with wine. I guess I will need to find a good coffee shop here in New York. The only way to find out is to try. Thanks for your viewpoint 👍

People should care, because 🥭's company has been served and will be sued if they don't completely overhaul their source code or at the very least give credit to the developers within something like 26 days from now. The lawsuit is a slam dunk, too.

don't worry, Lucid will pull a Tesla on earnings mah dude, you can get in in the 2nd week of November, it should be under 35 without a catalyst by then.

Equities for one. It's not apparent yet because we're all still swimming in fed liquidity. In 2007 Ben Bernake publicly claimed there was not a housing bubble. It's hard to see where the trouble is until the tide goes out, my guess is there is a lot of risk in equities and derivatives. Think about the monthly opex crash. That's not normal.

Good on you; single moms would have cost you more than 30k.
You’re stoopid
So with Meta being spammed here, I guess were supposed to forget all the regulatory risk and buy now?
My favorite part of our retarded markets is that semi's will probably drop tommorow because of apple supply issues. Nevermind the fact they are probably dragging their feet to make more and price gouging everyone.
Tomorrow it’s the day NIO
Yeah….not the best day to buy calls
What do you think about the Mastodon claims on Truth Social?

More drama or something of substance?

I think it's just drama, considering the whole issue is resolved -- if true -- by simply posting source code. This is all a bit ridiculous and not even worth the reading time.

I often buy options about 110 days until expiry. Theta decay doesn't start to accelerate until ~80 DTE, so that gives me about a month for my play to work out before I consider selling.

Why avoid single moms? Clearly they like to fuck.
Because it's all running on overprinting of money. Even if conditions are terrible the money in money market funds will viciously buy the dip. We won't have price discovery until that money is depleted.
Because a lot of analysts are slow to shift their estimates.  The Fed GDP Now model is always much quicker to change, just look at it.  Markets price in that though.

I have 100% of mine in AMZN
It’ll go up
&gt; The 2.6% was the prediction before they knew what happened in Q1 and if you look at the graph it is not a straight line but an exponential curve which means there has to be some kind of break point where growth will stop accelerating, that's why people thought it would go up another 3%.
Everyone knows it will pass eventually, already priced in

The problem is, there's still a ton of pessimism in markets.  Look at Sentiment Trader's optimism indexes.  Was trending down for months as markets kept charging higher.

Valuations are higher than ever on a relative basis because there's nowhere else to invest money.  That's more of a technical issue than a bubble.

I think we still have at least 2-3 years and a blowoff top to around S&amp;P 500 at 6000-7000/Nasdaq to 23000-25000 before this thing goes bust.

The CFO stepped down the day before they released earnings date so that didn't bode well and proved to be so. If they get a major EV company to take their tech then it could go crazy but that could be days, weeks months, years away or never if someone comes out with something better.

Theoretically, today should be like a -3.5% day but it won’t happen. And that bugs the shit out of me, because

-Tapering is marching in full steam ahead

- inflation is killing all gains

-Supply chains are crippling economic recovery

-Earnings are over so there isn’t really anything bullish to look forward to

But it’ll end up being flat, just you watch
Fuck AMZN stupid ass shitshow company RIP my calls.

Yesterday was supposed to be the start of a correction. This market is bullshit. I’m going home

Every time I make money I proceed to short tsla and lose it over again. 10/10 would do it again
But they gotta pee in the bottle though no bathroom breaks

WSB is great. You guys helped me lose 30k last month, but you also convinced me to avoid single moms. That’s a win in my book

Hey guys, my name is Walter and I just turned 12 years old. I’m really in to Roblox and investing and porn. I started last year with $20 my mom gave me and I now have $670,000 spread across three brokerage accounts, but I’m worried that I’m falling behind my peers already. Do you guys think I’m doing okay?

I made 62% on Tesla shares from buying the March dip, sold and now I have all cash. I would usually buy that Apple dip but imo I’m not feeling it.

Or all those people that quit, once the economy starts slowing companies aren't going to look to add more production lines. They end up stranded without a job. The first thing that happens in a recession is companies stop hiring. Just see what happened at the beginning of the lockdown. Eventually, this all leads to deflation, but to get there you have to go through a lot of inflation enough to make people start screaming at the Fed until they raise rates.
TSLA touched $1,088 AH, I'm ready as FUCK for Pre-Market tomorrow.

Yes, the thing is everyone knew this was coming, look at the Fed's GDP Now model, was already below 2% for Q3 on October 3.

I'd expect 4th quarter to be around 4-5% and 1st-2nd quarter 2022 to average 5%.
this is the good times? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)

Why does general reddit get so weird over multi billionaires; such as when they get yachts or giant houses? Shouldn't they be shamed if they're **not** spending money into the economy instead? Do they just expect the richest people in the world to live their same shitty life? I don't get it.

Every daily thread on this sub has at least one, but usually several, smart guys who show up all smug and state that they are going to short tsla.

Honestly pharma stocks have been boomin but just check earnings the past 2 dates like July 30 it totally tanked but prior April 30th it crushed earnings and jumped a few points, also are you playing at open, what time are they having earnings?
We live in a world where guys will eat ass but wont eat the first slice of bread
Why?
We're not even seeing 1% days as much now.  Still there, but I think trend will subside a bit.

I think markets can still move up say 10-15% each year for the next 2 years before a 20-25% upward move in a blowoff top in 2024.
If you don’t use water I don’t consider you normal
In a bubble everyone is an optimist, they could stand on train tracks watching a fast-moving freight train bear down on them and think it would only leave a scratch. When the bubble pops, everyone becomes a pessimist.

If unemployment rockets then we will be there.  Not seeing any reason to think it will though.  Eventually automation will probably be cheaper than the wage demands.... maybe that'll set it off.

How long does it take to become a "sophisticated" trader?
If investors really though that this was going to look like the 70s, markets would be down 20% right now.

Of course markets can be wrong..., but that's a pretty big short if you're right.
Can they just write a new article every day increasing the number by 100,000 until TSLA hits 5k?
if you dont wipe your ass using two hands i dont consider you normal
Amazon really needs bezos
I think the Italian touristy shops are probably better than Starbucks in terms of atmosphere and have possibly better coffee quality. The regular Italian coffee shops that serve Illy and Lavazza coffee aren't that good. Starbucks serves Starbucks brand mass market coffee at Starbucks owned shops. Regular coffee shops in Italy that serve Italian brands of mass market coffee but are independently owned are a mixed bag. 

The best coffee shops are third wave places in the US that serve a wide variety of single origin coffees and use fancy preparation techniques. The difference is high quality drop coffee at a Starbucks, high quality espresso at an Italian shop, and some hipster spending 10 minutes preparing your freshly ground made to order pour over using the most expensive coffee beans possible.
My relative runs a fortune on stocks and she said she got a bunch of nio. I was concerned because i know it's discussed on here. I dont know what a bunch is but last time we talked stocks and buying she out 20k on moderna at $46 and she's still holding

Hey Guys, Dave Ramsey here just wanted to give you tip to put you on the path to financial freedom. Put plastic ware and aluminum foil in your dishwasher, it comes out like new!
Okay.
Slowing growth isn't really the story though; there's still a ton of pent up demand and there was Covid disruptions/supply disruptions last quarter which sort of sapped growth temporarily.

But we should still see above trend growth for at least 3-4 more quarters.
It smells like 1999.

Not to be morbid, but how hard would the market crash if Elon got shot and was sent into critical condition? Just as a thought exercise. Given how much of Tesla’s success is cult of personality.
All of it 

I’m making money then instead of taking profits I get greedy and hold for massive losses.

Can I comment twice?
I'm glad I ghosted both the AMZN and FB (Meta) recruiters. They both gonna dump a lot of people soon.
Goddammit its a statement. They said we're good at enforcing violations once we find them. The previous article was literally all about how they found Trump is violating their license. He has 30 days to comply, publish his source code. Next they will be enforcing. Which they are good at.

Probably should. Elon knows how to create price speculation on his companies like no one else. Don't even want to know the P/E ratio of TSLA is after today.

He sucks at marriage and picking girlfriends. But sure as hell knows how to make revenue and run up his stock price.
If it makes you feel any better, know that I blew 50k in profits on SPY calls that expired worthless yesterday that would have been $$$ today.

I accidentally stumbled into enph 3 years ago at 4.13. I got 3 shares.  Held for a month and it started to tank so i sold 2. Kept 1. Held it for 3 years and it is by far my best investment.

Also 3 yeara ago, i found 🔌 and got in at 6.13. Currently have 6 shares @ 6.13. My second best investment
I love watching people bet against TSLA and post loss porn. No matter how many time they think the stock is peaked, they just get their butthole ripped open even wider.
Got rotated to WFH for a month. Legit the easiest money I've made. Netflix, Fidelity, WSB, and my dog are all I need
I was in ENPH when they were $30 and sold at $75. Got back in for options a few times without anything noteworthy happening
It’s gonna be green. Because i just bought some puts![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
wonder if my META calls will print, sorta up after hours lol.
When are we going to have mulitversal markets so I can start losing money on Puts in different dimensions
NIO...
Possible, not probable.
Honest question: I can’t fucking compute whether the Meta news is more bullish than the UK/Whistleblower shit is bearish for FB. Can anyone whos looked more into this shed some light?

Slowing growth with pent up demand isn't as bad as slowing growth due to deflation fears or something.   People aren't buying because they can't not because they think the worlds collapsing.

For example... try buying a specific Trim Grand Cherokee... is fucked.
eat your own dont bet against it going forward.....
Metaverse.... Cuckerberg is such a moron.

You guys are gonna wear out your welcome quickly ;) but have fun and understand this is why people hate your stock cult. It's self-destructive if you want more people to join.
Prepare to let that shit sit. They are still far from building
So Apple missed for the first time since 2017. Amazon missed for the first time since August.
Even if you're a winner, you're still a retard! WTG!

What happens to FB ticker?

Jesus man, in your assesment it's almost like inflation despite slowing growth isn't forcing a tightening of monetary policy and stimulus.
[deleted]
By any form of logic you'd think so. Seems the market will be green no matter what now...

Wouldn't be surprised if both AAPL and AMZN are flat tomorrow
It’s going to get nasty tomorrow.
That’s right baby. Jk I’m still stuck in 2020, send help.

Bro you should see my all time chart. It’s all giant jumps up followed by straight lines down followed by months of nothingness. There were times I took some profits, but I’ve left a ton of money on the table and have run myself dry or too deflated to even look at the markets for months
NVDA got me rock fucking hard
I'll suck some D for money for sure. They pay me better than my Wendy's dumpster clientele
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Exactly. It’s so easy not being poor. Take it from me. I have 10,000 in the bank, and I only started with 20,000.
&gt; I just got a text from my dad that he lost $5 billion in the last 1 hour.
They own the license, they say he hasn't published source code when asked to. I mean its pretty cut and dry here
I’m up BIGLY this week because of TSLA but saw it close at the spot where it’s been going down so how could I? My morning put hit maybe I’ll try again 😵‍💫🙄🥺🤑
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

$TELL chart looking good, probably gonna grab some now while its cheap
That would make it MNMNG... just doesn't roll off the tongue.
Ironically enough, these AMZN/AAPL earnings probably show that we're nowhere near peak euphoria.

There's a lot of distress built into current market sentiment on the issues of inflation/supply constraints/employment costs/labor supply/etc.

I think markets will get a boost from those issues being mitigated and dealt with over the next 6 to 9 months.  Then maybe we go full blowoff top mode for a year or two if JPow (or whoever is Fed head) doesn't start a sharp rate hiking cycle.

Valuations are full especially on certain meme names, but there's still probably a lot of upside ahead from here as long as you're focused on the right areas (for now avoid retail heavy/inflation affected businesses, and then in 6 to 9 months rotate into those names).
I bought a small position so I have an entry point to buy the dip, but I guess I'm profit taking tomorrow

I mean mastodon has been around for a few years, its free software anyone can use. They're just making a stink cuz Trump is breaking the rules with it.

Gonna buy some LMND call leaps. Over 30% short interest and the stock seems to have pretty strong support around $60. Made some money on this back in May, let's see if I can do it again.

If you shorted it before close today, yes
It’s been a long year lol
This is the answer I was looking for thanks
if you were here last year you would know that tsla puts is a fools errand. I havent seen any tesla gain porn from puts all 2021.

They need to pack it up. It's over.
Sell AMZN and Buy TSLA is the way
Honestly, that's not bad
There will certainly be a dip, but due to AAPL’s market cap and how many people use Apple products, the dip won’t last long. Trust me on that- Apple isn’t going anywhere.

no i’m done with robinhood after this. they take forever to fill market orders, i swear it’s rigged. also u can only deposit 50k at a time and i’m not gonna wait for that. if i invest again, it’ll by spy shares in my schwab where i won’t buy retarded options

GG y’all. I’ll show myself out. Lol! What was I thinking when I dumped my SNAP calls today and put that money in TSLA puts 😔😔😔😔😔😔
[deleted]
Oof. If we gap up tomorrow to something like 458.5 then you’ll be okay. Otherwise, you’re 🍞
Starbucks doesn't sell coffee. They sell sugary milk with coffee for flavor. If you want good coffee, go to a local place. If you want an okay-ish but consistent-whatever-you-go coffee flavored dessert drink, go to Starbucks.

That said, I like the independent shops and I also like SBUX. Just know what to expect. I know that if I want a venti white mocha, Starbucks will meet my needs. If I want something special, I've got other options. 

I keep a supply of bags of ground Starbucks for my espresso machine, because I like the flavor and it's consistent. I also do one of those mail order subscription services of fancy coffees, so I have new stuff to explore with.

Overall, if you want just straight coffee, Starbucks is a bad choice. If you want to make it a heavily flavored drink, the coffee itself doesn't matter as much.
TSLA AH is like when you bust and she's still sucking
Holy shit tesla.

I've been holding to these 1200c all week waiting for this run to finally happen. God speed 🙏 🙌
&gt; Edit: Why the heck do I ask you sex-depraved tards anything

Mine wasn't about sex, it was about kicking bawse1 in the penis
This thing gonna drop so hard next week
What's with it?
i just watched what trump did to pump the stock market. I literally cannot even imagine what this man will do to pump his own stock. not to mention the 80 million cousin fucking degenerates that will scrape up every last dollars to buy into their lord and saviors company. I want to go long so badly

/u/Bleeding_Hemroid (1/0) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1080.0 when it was 1013.9 and it did, congrats retard.
Bought SPOT calls for $63 yesterday. Sold this morning at $210. They ran to $1090 by 8 am. FML
Even a broken squirrel finds a blind clock twice is day
It's rare to find anyone that doesnt invest in either TSLA or fake internet money.

Not that i'm against any(maybe slightly against fake internet money), but the point I wanna make is that: I am rare as fuck

Edit: and yes you guessed it right, still poor

I’ll look into it, thanks.

I guess the ones that Italians go to after a day at work. Maybe the tourist traps are better than Starbucks too. When it comes to places dedicated to coffee, I've almost never gotten coffee outside of Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts, lol. That's my comfort zone
been taking a break from options since i blew up my account with SPY puts, it’s been two weeks since ive done any options trading and i’m terribly depressed just watching the markets
Yeah but google actually had a good earnings, amzn was a bust.
So my Apple 11/26 calls are up up, sell tomorrow or hold till the 26th of November
I'm not even joking when I say that portfolio managers are starting to see $TSLA as a safe haven asset with stable growth especially after $AAPL, $AMZN, $SNAP disappointed.
What 0dtes should I play tomarow
Been holding a TSLA $550 1/21/22 C since last year. Yeehaw
Y’all really tried playing earnings when tsla is the real winner tomorrow
Can I take my ban bet ban early

FB PULLED A RON ARTEST
Only boomers drive Corvettes
A fat blunt
today it was tsla and fb puts. my fb puts were up over 100% and i didn’t sell cuz i thought it would go down more after the event. ended up selling for 90% loss. i was trying really hard to get back to my all time high
probably won't
META officially reversed today, hope you are on the ride to 350, I expect it by the end of next month
rebuilding = bullish.
So Metaverse gonna be live Squid Game with Zuckerberg as front man and board of directors as VIPs
new builds to run for my warrior in classic

or maybe a bull/bear play of the day/week
You and I both know that $200k is coming out of safekeeping as soon as you lose your $40k.
Sold my AAPL calls today in expectation of an earnings drop. A broken clock is right twice a day.
Need way more blood than that

I'll buy a 2023 Corvette Z06 instead of Tesla ,  not getting a Tesla until they've obtained lev5 FSD and the law allows them to let the car drive itself without me touching the wheel.
At this point there won't be any dip to buy at open

Holy fk tsla
rip in piece to people who think high short interest is a good thing.
Good idea to hit on the people responsible for firing employees for hitting on people at work
Nah they will print, just hold out
Good boy $TSLA, keep marching towards that $1100 🤑
That feel when you don’t have a wife 😔
Was a math module on financial math actually, so it was for applied math/stats math majors. Technically the most useful module for math majors, spent 3/4 of our time learning useless shit like nUmBeR tHeOrIeS.
Nice use of imagery
Man, 🐻 are anticipating a crash. I don't think calls are the way
Will AA cuck the bears? Place your bets
By "real Italian coffeehouses," do you mean the really nice ones in touristy areas that charge a ton? Or do you mean the regular ones?
A bomb can literally blow up NYSE and SPY would still go up
No, everyone is taking their money out of tech and putting in it tsla tomo
How fuk are my spy 460c’s?
75% of symmetrical triangles breakout to the upside. Odds not on your side.
This $FB Meta shit is super bearish imqo. Billions and more billions plowed into something with no revenue for a generation. Money suck.
Can I get my flair changed
GM gonna sell as many EVs as TSLA in 2025
what becky stocks are hot
LOOOOOOOOCCCCCCCIIIIIIDDDDDDDD!😎
Well, whoever is controlling this crazy wind that knocked out the power at my work... thank you. You kept me from selling my Tesla Call in the last minute of the day.
Please tell me you asked my verbatim question
Okay, hope you'll be good
**Tesla calls for tm at open 🤩?**
Amazon falling didn't as much as I'd hope. Hopefully someone eats another bat overnight
😆
I agree. I don’t trust any EV company besides TSLA. But, isn’t TSLA a tech company, not an EV company?
Might win my banbet. But at what cost?
GUHHHH
It's a pool
google was down -4% ah when it reported earnings, and was up 6% the next day


hopefully amzn can bounce back like that
It will pre market
Oh look another month end with a market sell off. I'm shocked! Shocked I tell ya.
Thinking puts
It will drop tomorrow when it gets downgraded and big money starts to cash out.
Sold my spy calls early....again. Oh well profit is profit
Are you guys starting a podcast? 

Anyway definitely options. I think I've heard people ask more questions about different options strategies and what everything means.  Which ones go up or down, when are you on the hook for execution, how much money that can potentially make, etc.
How do you know what Ass tastes like
What were your plays?

He was programed to read facial expressions and body language, not how to immitate them.

Mmkay. The source linked by this news article only shows proof that someone is *claiming* the Trump Organization violated this ToS.

There's been *no* evidence shown/provided. *No* lawsuits filed. They *claim* evidence exists, but have *not* even shown that a cease-and-desist order or anything of the sort has been issued.

It also says, "*I and my colleagues at Software Freedom Conservancy are experts at investigating non-compliance with copyleft license and enforcing those licenses* ***once we confirm the violations***."

So, they even state that they haven't confirmed the claims. It's just claims. Slander, if they don't show anything for it. The site also hasn't launched, so they have no way of even knowing if the claims are true.
DIS gang stand up
I bought a few spy and more qqq. We live or die together.
Tesla&gt; Apple &gt; Amazon &gt;cuckerberg
AMZN and AAPL being bought back up on flat earnings.  SHOP up on crap earnings.  50+ P/S ratio growth tech (TEAM, NET, SNOW) sky-rocketing on "meh" beats or anticipation of meh beats.  TSLA being TSLA.   C-r-y-p-t-o being c-r-y-p-t-o.  Valuations at histoical highs - dotcom level highs (https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/)

This market is being very VERY generous and forgiving for the bulls.  It's pretty much being hi-jacked by eternal optimists and momentum pushers.  I wonder when it will flip.
It’s AH lol. Let the market open up tomorrow to see the real price action
When in doubt.. just play 0dte tesla
Easy 50-60
Damn. Imma have to FOMO more shares into this bitch. Fuck it, anything below 40 I’m gobbling up shares.
this morning FB dip was free money pretty much
i lost 260k the past few days. i don’t even feel bad cuz i’ve become desensitized to losing money. i have 40k left in robinhood and i’m gonna yolo until i get 200k or lose it all. i’m gonna quit trading no matter what happens after that. i still have 200k in safe keeping so i’ll be fine
Ouchie that’s going to sting. They weren’t going to let those print before the shitty earnings they’re definitely not now. Don’t get mad at me I’m just the sober guy in the room while everyone else is high off euphoria from this week. Although if the market doesn’t shit on itself tomorrow then it truly is broken &amp; it never will again.
How can I short cow milk

You reckon Apple is going to smash earnings next quarter?
A real Italian cappuccino is amazing. I haven't had any coffee in the US that's as well made. They probably use really high quality non-pasteurized milk in Italy that we don't get here.
Fat chicks
Beware of following trades on here. I mainly come here to shitpost and spaz out about my trades but seeing lengthy posts and comments about LCID is weird as hell. They don't have a single car yet and the cars their making are 80-90k compared to the model 3 that's 50k. Tesla might dominate for years to come in the EV space, cause they have autopilot, wicked acceleration, and it's American. Can't imagine a world where people go out to buy a Lucid Air car even if they have the money when they can buy a Porsche or a BMW EV. That being said, I bought 50 shares of LCID earlier. The only thing that seems to matter is hype but I feel like this stock is nothing but hot air
Welp. I think my 0DTE AAPL puts are fuck
nvda into earnings ? or did I miss the train already?
becky index is a great performer.

I regret not doing a ban bet on SU. Scared money? 🥴

My move for tomorrow is RDBX stock….🚀🚀🚀🚀
Mofo would charge extra to turn my blizzard upside down.
I bought several Lucid 42Cs for tomorrow. Am I gonna be okay?
Dating HR is a recipe for getting fired when shit goes sideways.

They’re fried
It is when you have 2000 shares leveraged and LCID about to open at 50 tmrw
up 1% is worthy of a shrek cock

fuck you for even making me check
I got my last tip for a +25% in the daily at 2am. Interesting crowd!
Whichever one of you who bought Tesla for $1094.94 don’t worry my guy. We coming for you too

155k volume on the TSLA 1100c expiring tomorrow.  What the hell.  This will be pinned to sweet daddy fuck tomorrow.
Imagine choking on a mango 🥭 so sad
what does zuck know about facial expressions and body language
I majored in econ too. I don’t remember learning about options pricing, just the definition of an option. Then again, I smoked a lot of weed back then so my memory is a bit fuzzy. I still do smoke a lot of weed, but I used to, too
My puts would appreciate

Majored in math and econ. We learned options and warrants pricing, never learned anything about stocks though.

Already back down to lows not seen since Monday. Tragic.

Lock that down for a side bet with me for a cool stack or do a ban or bet since you’re so confident. You really don’t think a lot of institutional money is selling before the weekend filled with uncertainty after shitty earnings then PUT your money where your mouth is.

Undervalued? 🤯
&gt;	Traders are swarming the market for Tesla Inc. options to bet on a continued stock rally.

&gt;	Almost one out of every two dollars spent in the U.S.-listed options market through Wednesday went to Tesla options, according to Cboe Global Markets data. On Monday, traders spent more money on Tesla bets, in what's known as options premium, than they did on every single other option in the market combined. There are more than 5,000 stocks and exchange-traded funds to trade.

Are you ready?

This earnings makes me so much more confident in the market. Big drops bought up before even the next day. We are big green tomorrow, bears will go back to their monthly check ins to brag on positions they don't ever make money on.

They'll both be fine longer term.  AWS numbers look good and AMZN still has dominant market position once we get to the other side.

AAPL still has its growing services business.

Just a matter of getting through next 6 months imo.  I think both can start delivering earning surprises by mid-2022.
How do you quantify it? How much a mention at Motley Fools count?

Im all ears if you got something, currently looking for next play
Standby for an epic open on TSLA 1100 here we come
You got it general. Maybe a MSFT inclusion on the good side too. Universe is aligning nicely.
Who said we’ll fall?
Fuck DWAC for going up today sons of bitches
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
It's not a bubble if it never pops!
If amzn goes green, I will eat those nuggets
My Apple $150 call got me 3.8k. Let’s fucking goo!!!! Now just 10 more k and I’ll be in the green
#2 The inverse relationship of Microsoft’s market cap and my golf handicap index and how I will be seeking sponsorship from them to train
It's hard to beat the previous earnings. They lowered margins this time and investors took it as bad news, which is completely retarded. They're not trying to slow down demand at all. They can afford the margin reduction.

The largest retailer in the world, in the midst of a pandemic, only grew by 29% which is on top of 23, which is on top of 100) and not 30. Lol. What a world.
If futures aren't drilling its probably going to recover tomorrow with the typical overnight gap up
# MVIS lmaoooo back to $1
For example like... defense stocks and the defense budget environment. Solar panel tech stocks. Etc
Have a good trip.
Jerome left the the table long time ago u fucker lmao ahhh fuck me
yeah but summer is only 8 weeks long
It looks like Apple is going to kill my portfolio tomorrow. That stock is allergic to breaking $150/share.
Short term fluctuation don't mean jack shit. 10 years from now Apple will be at IPhone 23 and i guarantee you the stock price will be much much higher then it is now.
I honestly don't believe the futes rn

/u/mogiyu (0/1) made a bet that BABA would go to 200.0 when it was 167.35 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
What scanners to pick up early run ups
Didn't stop every other news site from blabbing about his social media site.

In fact, I only found about about it because WSB couldn't resist blabbing about it either. I knew before the pump even hit, thanks to that. Trust me. We'll know.

All is right with the world

I want a  big bag of fukn blow right now fuck this
take some magic mushrooms and go for a hike bro
sigh. AMZN is back to what I bought my calls at + the IV is prob lower due to earnings being over. Easy come easy go.
You're too good for us. Let's hope the MBAs can keep from turning either of these into a Boeing or HP disaster story. If they start doing stupid shit to make the bottom line look good in January to the detriment of April or July or 2023, then I'm bailing like a 737 Max.

It may be good for options holders to go full-GE-MBA but it won't be good for anyone else.
LEV and GLXY. Electric buses and... Something financial, it's pretty vague.
A dumpster fire full of dirty diapers does deserve some attention
Yes I agree. I expected more pop from their last earnings. I am beginning to think the supply chain issues cast a shadow over every affected business, whether real nor imagined from investors
How? Isn't he banned from every social media platform?

I'm long Coin 400 11/12 and Tesla 1500 11/12. Coin is a piece of shit tho I should have put it all on Tesla. Every fucking time I trade COIN I get burned.
Quick question for you guys on live talks:

1. What topic(s) would you like to hear WSB users discuss?

2. What topic(s) would you personally be interested in speaking about?

Edit: Why the heck do I ask you sex-depraved tards anything
No problem. I’ve been using it for a few years. Bought the pro version and never looked back. Don’t remember which features are locked behind the paid versions, but they are 100% worth it.
If you could go cash gang right now would you, or wait until tomorrow?
10/28 was an inside job
The hyperbubble climax has arrived. Zero news, stocks go up. Nvidia has arm deal halted? it goes up. People are dead broke and have have no money? Stocks go up. Stocks. Go. Up. 

Im even saying this as a long time bull. Im moving out of my parents house and trust me, i will not be able to afford anything and MANY MANY more people are in the same boat. What the in the cocklick fuck is bullish about anything thats happening????
His statement doesn't prove the opposite to have an inverse effect

His point still stands
AAPL puts are going to be red tomorrow. Flat earnings IV crush.
I luv u 🥺👉🏼👈🏼

That’s everywhere…muh bacon is $12.99/lb right now. Something, something, inflation, something, something, transitory, something like that.
Depending on how bad they weigh things down, I think we see some struggling to break 460 if SPY opens green
Currently living in CA, but with a permanent tax home in a lower tax state.  Highly recommend.
Yes, but only for a week.

Will probably buy some utilities abs hold for 25 years
One of these days apple is gonna have positive reaction to earnings. And I’m almost certain it will be the one time I finally have nothing at stake
Can't wait to write Apple calls to you all
You’re hilarious
I prefer CLF because they own their ore miners and can sell to others during supply shortages, depending on what's more profitable. I agree, though. Dominoes are falling into place for the commodities supercycle to take off. This is just one of many catalysts.
Yall thought AAPL dip wont be bought???? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
When is it gonna PINS turn 😭😭😭
Y’all trippin appl fine
Fucking expectations = manipulation 

They can just set a number out of their ass so a company can beat or miss during earnings

That’s some bullshit tbh
Feels like NYC lunches doubled in price compared to pre covid
Its a nice er to play if you are the type of guy that like sucking dicks.
Appl is going to dump so hard tomorrow.
She makes good points.  If that causes moderates to steer away, it is probably them having trouble with their own justifications.  Instead maybe get involved in a discussion instead of running for the hills.  She can be super left, but she’s accurate about all the injustice.
Have depression
Would he have Gotten banned?

After hours movers is complete opposite of yesterday’s. Lots or red very crooked #s and some w very large market caps. 😳

Move to California. Rich state and safe from covid. Probably the best state in US
FB did too AH on their earnings, just saying…
Cheddar and sour cream or bust.
what are lasers even?
I had SPY Nov19 440 Puts.. Saw + $70 per contract but didn’t sell yesterday. Today AMZN shitting in pants in the corner and AAPL knocking its head on the wall was like Gandalf coming to rescue. 🧙‍♂️
I bought SPY puts right before close, I need bias opinions about this being smart
I can’t believe Amazon fell almost 4%. It hasn’t been that low in forever. All the way back to October 25th 😱
or 420, these are volatile times
&gt; Fuck off, I'm busy.
False equivalence. P -&gt; Q isn't logically equivalent to Q -&gt; P
Why?
AAPL COMING BACK MUDDA FUCKA
I don't usually get in on things that have such a massive run-up after the fact, nor do I really have an opinion on their product - haven't looked into it too much. I'm just commenting on the stock price difference and how nothing has really changed between yesterday and today to warrant the marketcap going up by $20 billion lol. I'm not singling out LCID btw either - TSLA gaining $120B+ in market cap after announcing a $4 billion deal is an order of magnitude more irrational imo.

A 5.3% gain on a day NASDAQ went up 1.39% doesn’t sound very idiosyncratic.
&gt;Apple's (AAPL) revenue for the period increased to $83.4 billion from $64.7 billion, while analysts had been looking for $85.1 billion. 

All this over a 2% miss during a chip shortage? Hmmm. Calls in the morning.
Here we go bitches. Apple dip was fake

That's what amazon always does on "poor" earnings. The dip gets bought before open and it will be flat.
It's insane what TSM is trading at. They're the only ones that don't *have* to lower their margins to make money.

Shit earnings? Bruh they’re up 100% YTY

It stopped back to where it was an hour before close. No big deal. We do need a red day in here somewhere.
Or it could get crapped away and end in shambles like the rest of Trump's business forays.

Smart money is playing Lucid
Tim Apple is going to hear about this.
Excellent response thanks. I read a few WSJ articles around this issue. Basically saying the same. Co. A makes silicone plates, Co. B draws the conduits, Co. C pieces them together for whatever end use.
Everybody is paying higher shipping costs also.

So puts on everyone!!!

AAPL changing its name to suck my dick
I'll get the ouija board
goddamn, sorry for the rant, but i just had the usual thursday night too many beers at the university, so obviously was hungry and decided to get a BigMac for 6.50 and then a Double Whopper for 11.50 because I didn't have enough yet. Why does BK's food tase twice as whack for twice a price? Is it only like that here in Switzerland or also in America? Puts on BK and calls on MCD, first thing in the morning tomorrw... no seriously, what do you think, I never understood the whole debate, in my opinion McDonalds is just so much better for the amount you pay?
Such a great catalyst for the next great rally to $SPY 500.
Tesla is building one so I guess that makes sense.
Market fake AND gay. not just one of those, but both!
If Amazon and BABA wanted to buyout wish for 10B cash in 2015

Then Wish is even worth more than that now.

SMH.  

“At many businesses, Gen Z employees are given increasing leeway to drive internal culture, too. Emily Fletcher, 42, who runs Ziva Meditation, noticed that at her company retreat the junior people were the ones who were most comfortable stretching the bounds of what is considered professional conversation.

This became apparent when the staff participated in an exercise she calls the “Suffie Awards”: sitting around a campfire and sharing personal sources of suffering from last year, trying to one-up one another as corny award show music played in the background. It was the Gen Zers, Ms. Fletcher said, getting the most vulnerable by speaking about partners cheating on them or the loneliness of a solo quarantine.”
Ofcourse, not denying that. Just wondering his portfolio exposure. 

My biggest supported positions will get sell orders once that shit trends down though, even Buffet would/should as a trader.

Probably will end up in the negative tomorrow, but eh, I only gambled because it was a negligible amount, for me at least.

You'd be insane not to get in on LCID rn when they have better batteries than Tesla and are bringing quality jobs back to America when we need it most.
&gt;	After the market closed, the company reported $20.6 billion in profit for the quarter, or $1.24 a share, up from $ 12.7 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected profit of $1.24 a share.

Ah no wonder they dipped. Of course. It all makes sense.

He's unlocked the art of being relatable,

Like a Tom Petty song.
Definitely not always , Hood didn’t pump before earnings and still fell

Which half of you never heard of Robin Hood?
Mmm, good luck.
You mean all 42 ah traders haven’t tanked it? Oh it should be just fine tomorrow then nothing to worry about.
Either way.. talking shit
Thank you 153 APPL sell limit
Yes 👍
Gotta ask yourself, why is this ape pushing a ticker.

100% of the tjme its because he has calls and wants to make bank by conning other apes into shares.

tsla 1149 tomorrow
It's literally a system built on always going up lol.
Bacon grease! Get your bacon grease here!!
Good/bad
Seems like any EV that makes it to production is somewhat guaranteed a massive pump - idk how anything they said today was worth $20B but this is the way things are.
Mvis what did you do bby? Lemme guess, not make money again?
Xom is definitely free money though right?
AAPL GUH
I thought you were holding poots? What's wrong, the lobster tail acting up?
Whole Foods by me put a bar in it for while you shop, ATH tomorrow 😎
Look at the bigger picture of the past 2 days:

GOOG and MSFT are thriving because they aren't as impacted by the inflationary issues in the economy.

AMZN and AAPL are struggling to handle the issues of supply constraints, employment costs (especially during a surge season like holidays), shipping costs, etc.

Next 6-8 months are likely to be a continuation of this theme: avoid employee heavy (relatively)/shipping heavy/huge footprint, retail based businesses that need to get to the other side of this inflationary period.

Then when things get under control, markets will rotate and we will likely see AMZN/AAPL and other names like them outperform.
Less letters is the key!
Rookie. Anything that pumps pre earnings dumps after earnings. It's science.
It was your money getting the 10:1 split.

Honestly I am more left leaning then anything but home girl is a little extreme, even for me. And she makes good points but clouds them in ignorant justifications that make moderates steer away.
Should announce a removal of dividend to save money through the coming recession.
Or...some bought at the bottom of the September dip and went longer term, along with buying into commodities back in August.
“Almost one out of every two dollars spent in the U.S.-listed options market through Wednesday went to Tesla options”

I believe its mostly, if not all, you guys.
AMZN and AAPL did complete opposite of MSFT and GOOG.
In fact, guess what: YOU are using the INTERNET right NOW.
LMAO MVIS got burned
They offered no guidance my dude
Can you please using smol txt now?
Can’t believe all 34 people trading after hours haven’t tanked it.
&gt; The US Navy.
They missed sales
#MOTHERFUCKER
Fish eggs a scam dude, go for the cheaper makis to fill you
Congrats but by that time the rest of the week will be like 7 hours
The OI on 11/19 calls is insane
Who else is buying more MSFT calls tomorrow?
I ma thinking closer to 1000
They become puts
Can you see once he makes sell orders though? Don't be oblivious mate
Leveraged tickers lag in extreme times..that’s why you shouldn’t hold ‘em long time
These bitches love Sosa

They hate my portfolio tho

It's more like contra on an arcade machine or something tbh.

Insert coin to continue.
Bears wanted a sign, this is your sign.
It doesn’t fall very far from the tree
And we’re at all time highs. Gooooooooo!
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
did amzn call already happen?
Apple expecting an even worse next quarter for holidays lmao, bears feasting
They missed on revenue.
Cause you touch yourself
Tru, both gettin' drilled
They only grew revenue by 29% and not 30%.
So did AMZN
Buy Lucid on the dips and it’s easy mode. NIO and PTRA probably next to pump. EVs for the win!
Just wait til the Boomers hear about Lucid on the evening news tonight. 

Shits going to 50 by open
Yea
I wonder how bad AMZN miss is going to be on AFRM
$MILF

$GILF
I gave your mom a bull butt spread
lol @ ur username
Just had diarrhea
Actually I did buy at the bottom yesterday before close. Very easy trade. Wanna get naked and wrestle over it?
STX, the other major hard drive maker did so well last week I was really expecting the same out of WDC
Why is AAPL falling ?
Fly pelican

Ain't ever gonna learn with no experience. No one says you gotta buy puts worth your life savings. Buy 1 and see if your intuition and knowledge is pointing you right. Next time buy 2. etc.

Actual losses/gains are teachable moments. Beauty is you can minimize losses via strategy above of buying 1 cheap out of the money put.
need apple between 142 and 155 tomorrow and tesla between 1020 and 1110. feeling good
Everyone nowadays talking about pronouns this pronouns that.

I just want to be pronounsed dead

How did QQQ recover but TQQQ is still down?
I sure do love the taste of crayons!
Imagine AAPL &amp; AMZN pull a SHOP style U turn tomorrow at open
Can you please stop using bold text every 10 secs ?
Objectively 

At a $2B marketcap...

This thing could easily go to $50B. Just like twitter

Widely held by institutions and this is a buyable dip for them.
Yeah. It’s coming.
AMZN at levels not seen since 3pm on Oct 25th (3 days ago)  😱😱😱
They can't afford anything besides the pump and dump memes.
After the "F" which is "R"
Red Day at close Confirmed
X flare hitting earth on Saturday
I'm triple leveraged in TQQQ on 100k margin.. Just trying to make a trillion dollars.
A few FSD-related deaths and an NHTSA investigation/recall would kill the stock
Bulls stupid af wanting to buy the tops everyday with the imminent risk of a gapdown instead of hoping for a few red days to buy at the bottom and rinse and repeat
What u copping
My 7-11 has sushi and is open all the time. Only sushi I can afford after joining WSB. Also, gets the taste of strangers out of my mouth.
His administration is a train WRECK
I don’t understand why they don’t. It would drive their stock up 20%.
Ok so I sold bull but spreads and have diagonal call spreads, literally can’t lose tomorrow right?
&gt; The average American consumes approximately 3.6 gallons of beer per year, with a low in Utah and high in North Dakota.
Why the fuck is the guy in Apple call harping about climate change and inequities? STFU and talk about your ER, you dingus.
Nope I have puts so straight fucking green. Up 5% actually
Got a filling this week, still sore.  Could be my tooth or ass what’s the difference
Yo $HIMX fucking go up you taiwanese son of a gold mine
Blood RED FRIDAY! Happy Halloween
&gt;Oh God why didn't I close my fucking Amazon calls, I was up over 50% on them

Same, there was a chance they run up 100+ bucks though too, ya lose some.
Guess what? People buy shit from Dollar Store
Cuz the two biggest companies in the world with the combined market cap of $4.25 trillion missed by incredible amounts and reported both on the same day?
Was hoping for a chicken dinner from AAPL, but looks like a crayon delight tomorrow night,.
Tomorrow? I’m gonna fuckin cash out my AMZN put I bought at 3:30. Then tell work I’m taking the rest of the week off
May be u have ur period🍆
We already live there. The simulation is hitting recursion due to a need for more processing power. We have to give up more of our brains, so we need to be able to accept a lower fidelity reality to avoid breaking free.
Not gonna lie holding MU is like getting kicked in the balls everyday. But I am still going to buy more. I wont give up
Cause they missed trade war crash, missed covid crash, and think if another one happens they can finally make money. Or they are just a 🌈🐻 that thinks it will make them money not understanding the global impact of a real crash. 

Temporary crash definitely has potential for money making and won’t have to long lasting consequences. The people who want to see it all come crashing down are a bunch of idiots that don’t understand it will be Great Depression 2.0 with consequences they can’t imagine including likely giving up the US position as the global super power. And that money they made isn’t going to improve their quality of life enough to make up for the consequences we would face.
**President Biden loves trains. Would love for his administration to run train on America.**
Herpes.. he showed me
&gt; I'm not going to forget about it.
Let her ride you in the Amazon position. 

You will get fucked like the call holders.
Uh.. sorry to do this but.. ^marginal Proof or ^temp. Ban
I hold TQQQ
Buy cheap - buy twice.

Only buy Made in the USA or Made in Germany.
Baba calls? 11.11 coming up too. Can't go tits up.
I’m just confused as to what innovation you’re looking for that’s not iterative. 

Screens? They got those. Keyboards? Got ‘em. 

It’s hard to imagine another groundbreaking technology that would actually be useful.
More like stairs up and Golden Gate Bridge down
Need AAPL and AMZN and gyna to tank everything
What a piece of crap.
and if it falls far enough it explodes
Lol where you in SU?
Exactly why I sold my calls at open. Too much green the last two weeks
Just hold and it'll be back up to where you bought it within a month, amazon has been bouncing between 3000-3500 for a year
#CANT WAIT FOR THE SUSHI STORE TO OPEN AT 7

What Sound does an iPhone make when it hits the floor?
D’oh!
Please. I just want to make some money. I don't want the market to be like Dark Soul.
Guess what? No one buys shit from wish
And tomorrow morning I shall consider selling my puts and flipping to calls. Too easy.

And by too easy I mean I spent the whole day telling myself to buy aapl and amzn puts but was a little chicken shit pussy so picked up next to no SPY 458p's before close that will be good for a fucking biggie bag from Wendy's without having to blow someone behind the dumpster for it.

I'm so tired of being a bitch.
I’ll pray for both of us
Now I'm whet. Overblown issues or strong considerations?
How long should it have lasted?
When buying the dip actually makes you money just like the good ol' days :)
Nasdaq is going to be a bloodbath tomorrow
If you can't beat em, join em.

Puta on lcid
It will go BRRRR right off the table along with mine. Drinks on Timmy tomorrow!
Big time, or will drop more in pre-market
*Daily reminder for tomorrow’s rug pull*
need my boi jpow to print harder than he’s ever printed before tomorrow to counter these shit earnings
&gt; I have one. Made money from selling 1120 and closed it today for free money to hold onto this call. Hoping we see a {sh ort squ eeze }since we are so far up this week and shorts will have to cover. Its shorts covering VS ppl taking profit.
Go to their last earnings call July 30th, they did horrible , look at the month chart, be careful
Me too, praying the puts print
But it does bounce.
Crawling ticker on Cheddar just says "Elon Musk isn't happy".

Gonna sell some AAPL and AMZN puts tomorrow on this dip
Holy mother of fuck am I bullish right now.
Alex play seasons in the abyss 🤘😭🤘
Imagine the margin calls on two of the trillion dollar MC companies being down 4% at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

Then imagine the derivatives that used those as leverage for a 25X to 50x portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

September might look like a bullish run compared to what November might bring the markets.
Not the best ever
Wtf is this call bro? Somebody take Time Apple off this call. Number I need number Timmy not some woke shit
It’s about to based on afterhours random jump

CHARLIE DONT SURF
First move will be pouring some out for the homie that bought that weekly Amzn call off me close to peak today. 

They done got fucked hard with no lube after hours, big oof
Is my 150p on apple gonna print tommrow
There are young people I work with who take coffee, smoke, drink brakes. Then has to go to the toilette every 30 minutes. 

When you ask about these, they say you are the mean one for not understanding their situation.
Yall really thought dip won't be bought? Lol...
I m sold. Give me -0.2% pullback
You promised me today and my banbet hinged on it. 🤬
Possibly. Lucky I have a bunch of X calls also.
Microsoft.
I haven't seen any bear loss porn this week and it's been mostly green.

Fuck off with your 1 sided rules
Chill dude. I probably have more invested in AAPL than you do…
Did they split?
going to check those out
\+12% TODAY in my CAD account. I didn't suspected I could have so much fun at the Toronto Stock Exchange ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Really wish I’d have doubled my uvxy calls today like I planned but it just barely missed what I said I’d buy at.
Your downvotes smell of CLOV and WISH!
Honestly if a chubby girl with big ass titties wants to hit me up I have zero qualms about smashing 👍
Because everyone things this can’t go up anymore even though people have always said that. Hint: we’re going up more
One stock lol cheers. Take a look at his net worth and get back to me.
except Google yesterday. Alphabet corp go LFG!
Anyone remember those 30 posts last month on how to play the “crash” and people were buying puts. LOL
Tim Cook and Bezos said the N word
Probably be buying lots of their own stock in the morning
Now I know why it's call WISH 😂
Okay.. am I trippin.. or didnt most major banks take huge cash positions recently? Wasnt there like an Incoming correction? and now we regularly test the 46... eh fuck it. SPY 500C 2/22/22. inflation and brrrrr.
Remember with a dead cat bounce the cat is still dead
Down 1% on a 7% daily gain is rug pull?
Holidays upcoming. My guess is that the miss will be offset by black Friday/cyber Monday.
What a shit stock lmao
I used to post in here before the GME debacle. Some things never change. Bears will always be 🌈.
too bad they drop ship hot garbage
So I will put all what's left from my salary into Hoge.
So that we can see some loss porn and buy the dip!
What do you want, a magic fucking wand? 

What else is there in the computer world? 

You have data, processors, apps, services, peripherals, and screens. Apple does all of those very well. 

There’s is nothing else. . 

Jesus Christ. 

VR? A screen. AR? a screen. What magic shit do you want in your life for Apple to sell you? Like seriously.
&gt; Yes.
Alright boys I'm planning a heist at the National Archives museum in five hours whose with me?

There are people who still think there is a bull case for dwac and are holding.

Don't feel bad for yourself guys 
Trust me

Do AMZN and AAPL have buyback programs going on now?
"X" doubt
Yeah but I didn't see what their earnings report looked like or the stock leading up to it
Get a metal roof.

Why do you guys want a crash so bad.

You'll enjoy having an actual smartphone, it will help you execute more trades and lose money faster.
probably the latter
Yea there is a chance this was the top.
&gt; They are out for the next 3 months.
Merida?
FB is a crazy buying opportunity I need my QCOM calls to print hard so I can exit and reallocate some capital.
Wait until tomorrow king 🤪
# Bad earnings all around today so this means green day tomorrow.
How long out are they? Ticker doesn’t change for a month
Friday starts with an “F”, which is next to “G”. Green Day confirmed
If Zuck really wants to control VR and the metaverse, he needs to buy PornHub
Holy hell Batman, Robin just got molested no lube dropped his tights and held on for the ride. Yes no gotta go, all in all out but but buy buy buy
Imagine bag holding certain stocks that people love to baghold when you coulda rode the glorious waves of Tesla and Lucid etc to 2000% your account. 

But you didn't. You watched and lost more $ and you know that train has left the station. You sit and gaze at it, thinking, hoping... but inaction is the death of opportunity. And the chance will never present itself again. 

The bags are getting heavy. The chances around you blow like leaves in the wind, dancing within reach.. but alas the wind never brings them back? Does it?
Someone's salty af
What’s the second M?
Nobody really makes their own anymore. The vast majority buy from TSM. Even other foundries supplement with their production. The only one larger is Samsung and they're not publicly traded. What that means is that TSM should be higher, since they're the only ones that can pass the cost off and still get orders. Even if they lower margins, they're booked for the next 3 years.
In my portfolio it is
this guy doesn't understand after hours
AAPL earnings be like: M1 M1 M1 Pro Pro Pro

If Amazon and Apple actually beat earnings, a rally after the dip might be justified. However they didn’t so why tf would they run??
Whoever the fuck told be to get QCOM up 800% thank you
Fuuuuck I meant to buy a put on AMZN at close but got busy and forgot.
Yeah I was here for the sneeze

Still holding well north of 100 shares
More like 1020
Except bad isn’t really bad. They are still blowout earnings, just difficult comps/estimates.
It will slow, but no reason to crash
You need people like me so you can point your fucking fingers and say, "that’s the bad guy." 

So... what that make you? Good? You're not good. You just know how to hide, how to lie. 

Me, I don't have that problem. Me, I always tell the truth even when I lie.

can you imagine how pissed CTN must be? He became the face of stupidity on wsb for a year at least and every aapl earnings play since he wouldve been on the right side of the trade
Yea, but worried about premarket and the whole market sell off
AAPL is only down $2 from open 🤔
that hurts..
I agree.  You will see a lot of analysts stand by their current ratings and PTs tomorrow.
I am SO Fuckin pissed off rn !  😡 

I had a new roof put on 10 years ago and the roofer used nails made in China well now they’re rusted and my roof is leaking and now I’ve got to replace the whole fucking roof AGAIN ! 

FUCK YOU Mutherfucking China!!!
Calls*
They are the true self learning AI.

The best part is if they're even capable of ethics, it would be learning from us.
Amazon revenue miss again????? Lmao at least it wasnt a violent reaction like last time.
Should have gone all in with the MSFT calls today.

Instead, I’m mostly in DIS at EOD. So it’ll probably do that thing where it absolutely fucking tanks for no reason.

apple earnings call sounds like an ad
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
If you were here in January than you know this place got overrun and they literally have paid trolls and gme silencers in here. 

They bullied me into selling my position unfortunately, should have stuck to my convictions. Won't make that mistake again 

I've bought back in with all I can afford but it's a much smaller position now.
Yeah people will yolo shares
!banbet TSLA 1100 1d
F
let's paint the swan lgbtq for solidarity
Not really. 1 billion revenue miss. Apparently SPY cared more about apple anyway
I brought January $200 and $240s. Hoping we get a bounce soon so I can sell some calls against the first leg
Glad I held those Starbucks puts, gonna go buy a Frappuccino now with the profits just to flex on them.
with 50B a year in revenue.

Based on NET’s valuation, 5T?
GAMMA. Microsoft instead of shitty Netflix.
Do my FB calls just become MVRS calls or will I need to sell abs re buy
Are you living under a rock? AAPL and AMZN reported poor ERs today
That means it'll go up
I’m just glad nobody here was dumb enough to buy Amazon or apple calls for earnings. Couldn’t imagine someone being that clueless. Good job guys.
Pretty sure the next step for apple is bankruptcy.
black swan events been piling up bro
XOM going to XOOM XOOM tomorrow.
Never buy calls on earnings for big tech stocks except Tesla.

Or even better 
Don't buy if people are stoked to buy calls on the sub.
Everyone gonna get burned
You use the internet (which is a program on a computer, which is a machine with a screen and software on it). I hope this is clear.
Karen Finerman always talks sense!
biggest play was mistakenly buying tsla calls that expired this week instead of the next. 

shout out to my phone and setting up email alerts; that shit woke me up right at open from sheer volume. Legit woke up, saw many many %, instantly hit sell.
I feel like it’s crazy that anyone would see this report as negative. Earnings miss was a supply constraint anomaly. Demand for their products is higher than its ever been, and their revenue growth is insane for a trillion dollar company
Yeah? Ok? They make a shit ton of money you idiot. Who cares if they sell expensive cloth?

I bought some of that 💩
Apple is already fucking itself really hard by phasing out x86 CPUs.
sbux, can u do that buyback like... tomorrow morning perhaps?
Hmm, well, I finally admit it, I have no idea when AAPL will get to test 150 yet again. Perhaps this time next year.
Ban?
I'm not gonna lie, I'm selling my house as we speak so I can buy whatever 🌽 runs Meta.

Before yall tell me I can't live in 🌽 Zuck is building a 🌽 house for all of us to live in.

Upgraded laptop and wireless headphones arnt shit compared to the jobs and ivy era

Only thing it's splitting is its price.
Bad gdp.

Advertising revenue (GOOGL): Up 43%!

Revenue from selling physical products (AMZN): Down 49%!
That spike at the end means people bought right? I bet it opens green, or at least quickly goes up before 10
Gonna get killed tomorrow

Didnt they get an extension or something?
I believe I just got a pop up about come join my fellow degenerates . 🥳
How do I buy puts on the metaverse?
I’ll do it

Someone took a bite
!Remind me in 20 hours
That's bc people thought SNAP would hurt GOOGL way more than it did, then they crushed earnings. AAPL and AMZN....not so much
This trading thing is easy, you press buy when your screen is red and press sell when screen is green.
$20 washcloths, imaginary EVs…
one can only dream
Elon should wrongly accuse someone of being a pedo on Twitter tonight
Nice comma placement
Money flowing out of apple and amazon into Msft
Tmr blast off mode. Option chain all in the money
AMZN walking: https://comb.io/IjkvEu
All tortilla chips are trash.
There will be no Googl type rebound numbskulls 

It’ll pump a little but like Googl? Keep dreaming

Software boys, software and printing money helps
Even if you valued Amazon retail at zero, AWS itself would only be a ~100 PE company.

Compared to the rest of the tech market that seems like a discount
im sure there is some legitimate smart person explanation for this...but it does seem like tech follows that pattern to a T - price run up, ER could be decent, bad, great, big dump, start the escalator again -is it because 'growth' companies are always getting this Icarus flight of infinite growth priced in?
AWS alone is worth 2T
Wtf happening to apple?
AOC feet pics or gtfo.
Glad I didn't go for calls on WDC. Down 8% and dropping. In fact their price has been decreasing steadily for almost 3 months. 

Is this the story with all chip makers? Higher costs, supply chain issues. When will they make those big bucks though!?
AMZN miss is huge
Present them to me
That is the most automod comments I have ever seen on one person before lmfao
More like Tim Crapple am I right?!
Accepted
the snack that smiles back goldfish
You broke the bots, asshole.

You thought
Even if SPY only hits -2% tomorrow that's just foreplay for Novembear.

&amp;#x200B;

Better make certain to get plenty of rest and hydrate.
I can say with absolute certainty that Tostitos hint of spicy queso is, by far, the greatest chip on earth. Fight me.
You all forgot why Friday was scary. Now imagine Evergrande defaults tomorrow with those earnings.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Melinda looking for a new bull (run)
Microsoft dancing on APPL's grave AH
QQQ barely has a flesh wound after disappointing earnings from AMZN and AAPL. I don't even know what could actually make this fucker go down.
Meh, will be back to $4 tomorrow
God why the fuck do I always play random shit fgs
Slb, at&amp;t, snap, iwm and those are just a few i follow and saw dip fat on RH.
George tweeted about the metaverse.
🤣😂😭
I’m with you
Fuck your puts
The rise at the end of the day was exactly how I imagined it. Too much support at these levels for a drop off tomorrow. I’m going to sell my calls on the morning bump at open and roll them out next week depending on how the day goes
LCID making papa a happy camper 🔥
I’ve never seen this many auto mods off one comment.
I'm heading to bed right now at 2 PM so I can fast forward this shit to tomorrow morning when everyone one of my puts launch into space.
my portfolio hit resistance yet again today forming the ol quintuple top pattern, big red tomorrow
The market will be going into cardiac arrest tomorrow with all the tech downgrades. Us bears have never left. See you at the bottom!
Everyone misses earnings but spy is still above where it was at 3:30 this afternoon. Wtf
Black Swan Event incoming?!
M1 iPad, new AirPods Pro, M1 max MacBook Pro, etc etc etc.
Easy short prospect, just gotta time it right..
Oil Giants tomorrow to keep the Dow up?
CLOV
It’s not Googl sorry bro Amazon moves physical shit Googl just prints money
Nah. After this quarter they gonna have to drop AMZN
AMZN is the 5th largest company by market cap and they own large swaths of the internet and are going to be the first ones to have sex robots, no matter what Elon says.

Thank you Jassy for this buying opportunity
[deleted]
Loving it. Will help offset my AAPL calls
nah ur puts are fuk bro
Aapl if you could just go ahead and drop to 140 by open, thatd be chill af
if you have that kind of cash lying around then why not?
Not a holder, but issues with this quarter seem isolated to  supply chain crisis. They're growth in China this quarter was almost 80%! And their services are growing at more than a 25% clip. IDK, a bad quarter for sure but the future doesn't seem dim from where I sit.
MVIS EARNINGS COMING INNNNNNN
It has been done for a whole year. Time for a reverse

If less than 0 is possible then it is that
Lol, dis guy
We seem to be in some sort of melt up...
I doubt it people want to see 1100. TSLA is the only thing holding up the stock market right now. You shouldve gotten puts far out into next year. It may take awhile to drop.
Oh shit...I'm sorry my man but they are worthless now
Until it bounced back tomorrow before open
bul trap

-8% by AH close
#🐽
Wow nice jump
They still grew. They missed estimates, but they posted record earnings. QOQ earnings up by 69%. That’s impressive af for a trillion dollar company.
I got 50 1100 calls expiring tomr 🥴
You mean the day TSLA doesn’t juice the books to cover up a miss.
Me too, sell my puts. Load up on AAPL, call it a year
Ded. Where is an award when I need it?
No, you lose everything. Youve been zuck cucked
Dude, am I supposed to hand hold? Go with your gut.
HYPERINFLATE DEEZ NUTS
The FB event would've been better if zuck did the entire thing in his avatar after the introduction. What a wasted opportunity.
AMZN coming back. There may be hope still. LFG!
Tech stocks in a nutshell. 

Price run up due to earnings soon.

Bad earnings. Don't care that price ran into earnings.

\-------------------&gt; BUY THE DIP lmao.
Board needs to approve more dildos for Tim Apple to sustain his energy
&gt; I love Black Friday.
Hey I'm old enough to remember when Southpark did this!
Apple hasn’t put out anything Revolutionary in years
that's really bad. Well, I have puts thou
Analysts gonna downgrade AMZN and AAPL soon.. major dip incoming 🚨
She is more annoying that an annoying Aunt. You know what I mean, yall have one.
Lol.. oh wait
Probably. Didn't Chipotle also fall off?
Ikr, today has been beautiful
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Someone say Black Friday ? Tesla down 15% to print my 950 puts ?
I feel it cumming
The only idiosyncratic risk to the market has a 5.3% gain and wsb is silent.
Seen on PornHub tonight: Amazon gives AFRM a blowjob on public earnings call while analysts cheer them on
I know right. To get a 10% move all within market hours is wild. Someone got some cheap calls at open and made bank
How dare u good sir
Wish is done
Some people here haven’t seen a futures limit down
if it were any other company, the stock will have tanked 20%. fucking rigged market
My strikes are 135, if I’m above 140 by June I print pretty hard regardless, so positions are pretty safe. 

I want that multi-bagger tho
#DRILL TEAM 6 REPORTING TOMORROW

they wont change ticker
23k actually.
Huge miss is on AMZN. APPLE is okay
No bags, green is just better for everyone
Dollar Store is ass but people are still going there and spend money

Same with Wish
Lord, does this.mean that we are drilling tomorrow? Cause I did something stupid and sold all my SPY puts.

My 150 put hopes this is true
It literally lifted the market when it was crashing, so stfu
Visualmod you know that banbet was a joke right, you're not actually gonna make me steal the Declaration of Independence are you?
Watch my LCID puts print
Does tsla still have a chance to open green? Or are my Tesla calls fucked too? 😞
those children look like they’ll have successful futures, if only we can be associated with them somehow, preferably by doing something good to them, like rescuing them from being raped


but we are not rescuers john, nor are the children being raped


well steven, i guess let’s rape them so that if and when someone rescues them from us raping them, we will take credit for the rescue, because they can’t be rescued from rape if they’re not being raped


john and steven in unison: “for the children”
Adding more amzn
The golden days of APPL might be over. Ten years without Steve Jobs might have been too much.
Gonna preorder my lambo rn w deep OTM AMZN calls
Mango
Break even for me is $135 and even then I won't sell. I won't do profit taking until $200.
Get mad or get glad ™, depending on if my stock goes up or down.
🔥
Call me crazy but I think Amazon rips back tomorrow. Read the financials. AWS, where they make most profit, is on a fucking tear and is just a money printing beast. The supply chain cost is a temporary issue, so the retail segment will return, meanwhile AWS will continue growing at a fast clip.

$3600 in a few weeks. Maybe tomorrow🥱
[deleted]
Numbers seemed good
It smells like….victory.
And Kenny G
Welp, there goes my 11/3 QQQ calls
Can TSLA drop 50-60 points tomorrow for funsies? 🤔🤔🤔
Someone give this guy a gold!
MVRS

They already announced the new ticker.
Literally nothing that’s reported tonight matters. Apple will recover to close flat tomorrow just to fuck everyone who bought options. That’s the whole game now.
F
What’re the chances Apple recovers tmr....
N can be easily replaced
Expire worthless.
Tesla is not magic, it will not go up when the market crashes. Anybody still holding TSLA calls is a greedy pig, myself included
Plz god let spy open ok so I can exit my 457cs
MANGA
Which strike/exp if you don't mind me asking? I bought 1/21/22 220c
The beginning and end of today were fkn crazy but the rest was gay af
AAPL and AMZN already recovering along with SPY
futes limit down today for sure
I blame Kanye for Apple. Ever since that dumb iPhone plane he showed trump F
4/14 or 6/17?
Delusional ghey ber 🤡
How tf did you not hit with F? Shit rocketed

Edit: you got puts nevermind. You’re retarded
could that be some sort of omen for some of the other Becky stocks?
Especially when you’re famous for going ape shit on a crowd of unruly fans
Yeah today’s run was insane. I bought some Friday spy puts around noon.
"This quarter marks the first time since April 2016 that Apple has failed to beat earnings estimates, and it’s the first time since May 2017 that Apple’s revenues have missed estimates, according to Refinitiv data. "

135 tomorrow. Black Friday for tech.
I can’t wait to get my last laugh on Wish haters lol

I’m holding my $5 bags until this become a 10 bagger
Yeah I mean I hope there’s increasing pressure to offer a share split. And AWS needs to hurry the fuck up to dominate the company. It’s clear that e-commerce provides nice revenue, but looks like it’s plateauing with COVID.
Oh God why didn't I close my fucking Amazon calls, I was up over 50% on them
lol

They blamed China CoVID resurgence on the losses.
30:1, we can buy it with our Wendy's paychecks
Held my 1090 1dte call through the day hoping for exactly this.
can you elaborate what ticker
Market being unreasonable. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
That’s what I hate with people saying “Jobs was an asshole.” Hey sometimes you just won’t like your boss, but look what they do for the company.
It will tomorrow
So with Meta replacing FB is it going to be MAANG?

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Coulda told you that tbh the oven in my local SBUX has been broken for two weeks, haven’t bought a single panini

This is not a *drill* 😏

And I don’t think 2B revenue sucks..
$AAPL shit the bed.

I love earnings season. That smell. That gasoline smell.
Just wait…..

Next week maybe, not tomorrow cause it is Friday
More like Banbook. Im on a 30 day ban for sharing Alec Baldwin tweets.
AAPL gonna have to sell a lot more washcloths next quarter
How the turn tables.
Told ya this after market dip is a 🌈🐠
didn't we watch airline companies take tax payer money to fund buy backs last year?
WELP looks like I'm going to have to buy and ANDROID, because that's all I'll be able to afford now.
SBUX missed revenues.

Really wishing I had more Puts loaded than Calls. Sad.
Expire worthless.
meta world peace is a name that sounds almost as dumb as peter schiff
Same reason why Apple and amzn will. People want Those discounted shares.
I would say anything after April.
I had one but SPY spiked so hard it scared me into a panic sell AH on the initial Amazon dip
Huge miss on Apple lol
You had your chance, Amazon, now it will be forced upon you
Best tequila?
Amazon Puts once again printing
Nah
Nah......AAPL and AMZN will either be green by open or soon after.
The ones at the end of sleepaway camp are better.
Well it didn't go up that high, so still can buy it lol.
How may spy and QQQ puts looking
Never left msft
Not after being down 4% lol
Yeah all other corporations are saints 🙄
Green by open. I can already see it
You get zucked into the metaverse.
If SHOP rally today after missed earnings then Wish can too
Ya that’s weird man. Microsoft is a king.
Steve Jobs would've built an electric car that doubles as a dildo by now. Tim Cook doesn't know wtf he's doing
Yah you can. Carvana literally has the option to buy out your lease….
Imagine thinking SPY -0.22% in the AH matters,

It will be -1.22% after open...
I don’t know. But it’s crazy.
You got $330k in cash laying around? Ok then big dick baller
Dude, the top is in. Tech holds up SPY. With horrible outlooks, there’s only one way this goes. This market will dig into the ground slowly starting tomorrow until we drop these valuations by 30%, their true value.

The run is over. Good luck.
Hey how it going?
that shit is definitely worth $0 at open lol
I'm going all in calls tomorrow.
He’s hanging ~~out somewhere~~
Fuck it. If Buffett has his biggest holding in AAPL then I’ll hold for the rest of my life. Fuck you sellers. Eat my ass.
I've thought about this many times today

Thats my call too. Its “free money” theyd be stupid not to do it
Yup
Damn, tdoc went down on er and went right back up

RIP everyone's calls. It's a 🏳️‍🌈🐻 World
florida has very lax laws regarding cars. also the air is very moist and salty which make for very rusty cars. tons of flooded cars
what's criminal is using public tax dollars to fund private share buybacks. the trump tax cuts were the dumbest thing ive ever seen.
SPY and QQQ pree much are the market. What is broad
Nice bro, I'd sell a short term against 1 of those at the peak of 60 tmrw
What’s fucked up is I spent all day watching the market, and now it’s closed and I still can’t stop
they prolly hedge and write the loss as some sort of tax credit, that we tax payers end up subsidizing .. cuz fuck the middle class.



They play a different game than us small fish
Yes
Yeah these misses are super small. They will be green at open and pushing ATH.
From now on I'm referring to FB as Ron Artest
That was me dude, sorry. She literally fucked the shit out of me.
Aapl ripppp
Hopefully my RH money settles by Monday so I can cash out, transfer it to Tasty, and play next week.
Why did a bunch if tickers just make a tesla sign after hours? Straight down and back up? Vryyy scary
#WISH SUCKS
Can we get a good ol' fashioned limit down?

Oh no. FB isn't leftist propaganda. Bad for democracy!

If you must fuk something tomorrow please let it be QQQ and leave SPY alone

Stock split incoming
[deleted]
MSFT coming from behind to win the race.
Those calls are fucked
Got 4 Apple shares. Why not I guess
Why did SHOP rally today when earnings were missed
What happens to my FB calls when ticker changes? They just swap names as well?
I wouldn't panic just yet despite AMZN and AAPL tanking. It could mean that big money will be buying other stocks. SPY and maybe even QQQ could be green tomorrow. Or they could be red but the broader market will be green.
So considering this clown market where even 15 year olds are making thousands trading probably but if it is a bloody day no crying out of y’all. Just take it like a man.
I bought MSFT in feb 2020 for around 150. Sold weeks later at 158 because my hands were paper. Now it’s 324. But when I diamond hands into SPCE a year ago, it is almost down for the year! Not cool man!
Even if it's sideways I'll have doubled up on it worse case

Im holding 30c and 36p hedge.. if it's at 34 I'm golden and locked in 150% gainz,, the straddle is heavily bullish though if she goes to 50 I'll make a killing
Flooding damage.
Are we still in 2020 july? Lockdown started 4 months ago? Amzn chart tells me so...
Money about to rotate into GOOGL, MSFT, and NFLX
Shit I haven’t bought those 11/19 $BB calls yet the juice jug prophecized
Amazon slowly gapping up
You can sell puts on margin and make it without putting up any cash
God dammit Amazon what the fuck
Which ones are you looking at?
Damn, AMZN is just like the rainforest Amazon. Being chopped down to an unsustainable level that will have cataclysmic economic and ecological reverberations across the globe.
selling my sbux ER call gambles for a fat loss tomorrow. will i ever learn
$AAPL &amp; $AMZN missed. Tech is going to continue rotating into the $TSLA safe haven ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
MSFT is the play going forward. Could be a blue sky run candidate here shortly.
AAPL missed
Everyone sees AMZN and AAPL dropping, I see buyable dips in two of the most widely held stocks in the world. I have not given up on my $460 calls for tomorrow.
It's dragging CLF up with it, too.
Amazon is priced as to beat earnings while Wish is priced like it's not making money. 

Low expectations this Q3 is 210M when last 6 quarters average has been 700M for Wish

We are going to beat Q3!
Faxxxx
Hopefully tech rotates into FB/Meta tomorrow and my arss is saved
AAPL really about to cuck my QCOM gains -.-
Checking mint before the drill in the morning
Everytime SHOP gets to 1500, get puts.

Shouldn't it get easier to shit?

AMZN and AAPL: Shit the bed

That won’t happen until November now.. rip
That won’t happen until November now
That’s because you have a smooth brain
Why tf Google stop showing the graph when you Google a ticker?
AAPL and AMZN GG bitch
Sometimes market red, sometimes market green
36K worth of options expiring in one day?
Should I just buy 100 shares of AMZN after this dip then sell weeklies for like $2000 a pop?  You can earn $100k per year just selling stupid calls.
Yep services and subscriptions
def was, was hoping for a cinderella story/rebound after like a year of pure flat, but also is a terrible time for most warehouses

Shit has struggled to consolidate for over a year now

Attention: there are *3.75* market days until taper announcement. That is all.

I got out and then bought higher strirke 1/3 of my position, poor decision making, expecting a fucking infrastructure bill
Im always getting a train ran on me during earnings I literally cant shit anymore without any pain
Wow what a hot take and timely too
Buying off lease cars isn’t a bad strategy. At least you know the basics have to been taken care of.
Not THAT retarded but bought 1 hr before

TSLA please carry SPY so we can fuck the bears even when they were right.
Loading up on F long calls. Stock is up 100% this year and the same amount for next year calls are trading for PENNIES. 

Fundamentals looks great, especially with the move toward mostly electric. 

Load up on them and at worst, consider it a lotto ticket.
Why?
AAPL will be fine.

Amazon? More like damnazon
What the shit spy?!?  That AH drop is gonna destroy me at open
AMZN open only 1% down and I'll be happy🙏🙏🙏
imagine being in an economic boom and trying to short.
Yes 100% agreed on that.
Excellent. $5.36 per share in a quarter for a $25 stock is big money.

Lol retard alert
Can't wait until the Metaverse for FB turns into a gigantic google glass flop and they turn into my___.com
&gt; I think the Nadsdaq will go to 2,000
I'm afraid this rocket is gonna crash tomorrow because the pilots are Bezos and Tim Apple
Why did merck drop almost 6% then went right back up?????
Bruh Tesla was at like 550 this year and the market pumped 30% at that point
PYPL is the way
What do you think the Nadsdaq will go to ? Summer 2022?
Nah I’ve only been here 3 weeks
That 1% stock buy back tax that biden admin is proposing is borderline criminal, guy should be locked up

Have fun w your puts 🤡
Earnings week went like this:

TSLA puts? NOPE -3k

FB calls? NOPE -1k

GOOG put spreads? NOPE -1k

F puts? NOPE -3k

EBAY puts? YEP +2k

AAPL puts? YEP +3k

&amp;#x200B;

I started hitting when I was down to my last 2k. If FB, GOOG, F, or TSLA hit I'd be up 20k. I hate this fucking market

I’m going all in on Wayfair puts tomorrow
So glad I bought 200 AAPL $150p right before close.
Soooooo… AAPL $175 by close or what?
Baba biden please pass the bill and save my spy calls
YOLO loopring 🚀😎🚀😎🚀😎🚀😎
On the plus side, I've never had a foursome before today.

/u/artimus711 (2/0) made a bet that X would go to 25.0 when it was 23.5 and it did, congrats gigabrain.
Ahhh buying that AAPL put feels so good right about now.
watch spy dip to like 451 before closing at 455
No they would have skimped on equipment and rations
Next year will be a big year for steel.  Its one of the plays I'll be looking at come Q1 or Q2
You don't need to sell but this is the exact time when you should  stop adding to equities and start looking for other places to put your money.
Not missing anything except seeing them losses on the big screen
Anybody else retarded enough to load up on puts at close?
Talking head on Bloomberg says Apple bull thesis is unchanged.

Non-compotent revenue was up (I think this is Wall Street speak for services are bouying while supply chain hurts phone and device sales).
Any loss porn for me boys? I'm horny af

Hello darkness my old friend
Well tomorrow is fukt. I am fukt.
Imagine onlyfans metaverse
Thanks. I know it was a 50/50 gamble. This is the first time I’ve played earnings since learning about options. Might be a good idea to buy puts at open for aapl or Amazon and sell very shortly after for a quick trade? I imagine a steep drop

Heavy in LCID puts, not worried. Might even start green by tomorrow, but with big tech falling and their last sell-the-news crashing 50 pts from 70, I'm mighty comfortable holding over the weekend if need be.
AAPL price glitching AH
Fuck the bulls
Deee Wack to $38 tomorrow
Market is comical. Apple blows the door down q2…tanks, apple at par q3…tanks, everything is priced in lol

AAPL was inline with expeditions. Not a miss
9:45 am SHARP 🤣🤣🤣
Bless my spy 359 calls expiring tomorrow (are probably toast)
Who the fuck tells their boss why they aren't coming in?
Fuck this week. Losing money every fucking day.
Realized that the equity I have on the lease for my daily driver is more than I’ve made in payments. Can’t decide whether to just buy at the residual or just take the cash from caravana or Carmax.

Who woulda thought leasing a car would make me money?

See Shopify today
Apple gonna recover don’t bet against the apple.
Dafuq gonna happen to QQQ tomorrow? I'm afraid guys, touch me right here 👇
Attention degenerate permabulls. We were  quite all week while y’all where on your high horse talking shit. Now we expect the same out of y’all tomorrow when your calls get shitted on. No pathetic crying no coming to this sub looking for sympathy. Just accept your curb stomping like a man.
shit it might hit $150 in AH again.
Bul or ber, we are all fuk tomorrow
my apple calls are dead but at least I have my oil calls for premarket earnings right
It’s time for you to shut the fuck up
No. One has the growth-leading cloud offering, one has monetized the *chamfered bezel*.
No worries. Congrats, and fuck you.
They are just going to make TSLA the new AAPL as SPY charges towards 490. Do not underestimate the circus!
Yes at least to whatever the closing was then bleed out slow again
Didn’t miss!
This dip is fake and 🌈
Yeah this one is under, merger was approved today so ticker changes Monday. Its just such a fucking solid company, really wish we had a separate thread for smaller market caps.
Noooo Apple. Stay down. I want to buy calls in the morning you fuck.

Amazon has 1.5M employees , they would have won the Vietnam war.
Zuck could have gotten the world on board if only he'd shown off the pleasure accessories that go on the genitals and nips for fun in the metaverse
AMZN could be worth 3T tomorrow if they would just announce a 1:10 stock split
BAN bet lcid hits $42 tomorrow, October 29,2021
iPhone revenue missing by more than 5% is worse than anything AMZN announced.
Not after those 2 shit shows
those san francisco people. nothing but dongs and bongs
Time to watch MSFT AMD moon.
I plan to pick up more AAPL too. Glad I only have 🌈 sh and nothing in AMZN. the latter has been ded for a year. Now it is worst then ded 😥
I bought eBay calls slightly OTM NOV 19 just before close today. Thinking of doing the same for twilio.
Damm apple about to pull the fuck your calls and your puts maneuver ,typical
What happen I went take a shit and all hell breaks loose
Earnings for the quarter ended 30 September. Your purchase will boost the next earnings report.
I would approve if amazon announced a split tonight just stick it to 🌈 🐻
It shouldn't, but this is clown market. Tesla's 5:1 split basically 5x'd their market cap.
Wish uses planes motherfuckers ✈️

Did anyone else buy Visa calls today?
I sold 3320 Ps for end of November
Smart to take the W, good play considering how disastrous that could’ve been.
AMZN and AAPL need to take a page out of the musk play book and add corn to their balance sheet.
SPY puts and UVXY calls tomorrow. Got it.
For a brief second on Yahoo finance, AAPL’s AH price was even and I almost jerked off. I refresh the page and it’s down $6.50 😐 *wet fart ensues*
Congrats to whoever bought AMZN and AAPL puts. Even deep OTM will print big. 

You will wake up rich tomorrow.
Strike expire?
don't forget Facebook, or we should call it "Metabook" from now on!!

Yessss get wrecked SBUX! 😈
Amazon jumping green 3 times no news, 1000% stock split, see everyone at 4K+ open
The absurdity of the current market is that only like 4-5 companies make up like 25% of the entire market, one of which (TSLA), has a PE of over 400+.  If they catch just a sneeze the entire market cliff dives.  Talk about putting all of your eggs in one basket America.  There is no depth to this market at all.
Lcid. This is the wayyyyy
Rotation into Netflix wtf
If AAPL and AMZN are having issues, we are fucked
I was so close to doing AAPL puts. 

Oh, well. SBUX to 110/115!
God made PUTS for a reason
I just recently made a gamble on a month out Visa call. I follow eBay less closely than Twilio but after the steep drop it might be smart. Watch everything closely tomorrow I think it’s gonna get ugly.
You're right, its to scalp retail, its a perfectly logical reason from the non poor side lol.
I can't believe MSFT is coming out of this unscathed. It's gonna come out this week 10% ahead of AAPL and AMZN.
Zillow still staying strong in AH like a bad ass bitch
Save the Amazon . Not the rainforest, but Bezos’ empire
Alright so I guess Microsoft is the worlds most valuable company now
options too?
AMZN AAPL V SBUX MA cratering

TSLA COIN PLTR GME beautifully green

Lesson: buy meme stocks
I shorted AAPL for the event last week and lost big..

Meanwhile playing puts for the event was the real move all along. GUH!!
Timmy Apple was too focused on chugging dong and not focused on selling iPhones.

Tesla did the same number last month and I sold thinking it had peaked. It might not be next week but soon AMD will be at $175+. They posted great earnings. This is just MM right now. Waiting for all those greedy fat fuckers to load up then they’ll let it loose
apple smashed the EARNINGS, gonna bleed out with my calls

MSFT puts and AAPL calls

Yes, they are also widely held by all types of funds. I may be just hoping against hope, but if I was a large fund manager, I would be grabbing these up on the dip.

Yep 141/142/155/157.5 
Got awfully close to my calls today but I didn't close bc I'm greedy and figured they'd dump
&gt; AAPL down 5%
&gt; 
&gt; AMZN down 6%

AAPL down 5 percent SO FAR, 

AMZN down 6 percent SO FAR !

Fuck.
Lmao at this point Tesla is going to be the largest company on the world. Amazon and apple are fucked 😂
Honestly have you considered quitting?
Spy tanking for suree
My aapl calls are kinda fucked I guess - but they exp Dec so I might have time. Bought some shares in after hours cause that was a huge dump just now.
Analysts have given it a price target of like $4100ish. I bet it bounces back pretty quickly going into the holidays. As long as you've got options for a few months out like you should (me) you'll be fine
X gonna rip!!!!

No I wanna sell puts
🙏 I'm not interested in Amazon fucking Basics as a growth vehicle.
Exela only up 12% on partnership deal.  This will be a 100% runner.  Loaded $30k for the rockets to $5
hate that AAPL is gonna bring down stocks that have literally nothing to do with AAPL
Can’t believe fb dumbed so hard

Damn big misses, time to turn bear?
Exactly bro it works every time ! 💡
Semi-hard?
Fuckbook would be a better name than Meta

Hah, it always tanks on earnings. Last year they beat the highest EPS estimate by $1 and it still tanked 6%. Since then I only do credit call spreads
everything's getting dragged down by AAPL and AMZN

Hope you played this bet, too. Nice tendies for that one.

That’s 69% of spy
SPY puts I'm holding range every dollar from 457-453, longest exp is a weekly.  Blood red tomorrow would bring tears of joy.
Yeah? AAPL + AMZN is 10% of SPY. They each drop 5%...

.1 * .05 = .005 or .5%
It’s MAGMA
Amazon report. They're bleeding money from everything except AWS. Without AWS they would be in the negatives.

How long before TSLA overtakes AAPL in market cap
What do you think about buying eBay and twilio calls for a month out?
Yeah... that's why AMZN was up 1.59% at close and Apple up 2.5% at close... because they were selling off...
It did.  Market is going to hell tomorrow
Maybe Nvda fb and msft can save spy

Fyi Fed meeting next tuesday 😂
**I just walked into my girlfriends bathroom and there’s a massive shit that looks like a truck driver was here 😕**
Buy calls, stocks go down. Puts, stocks go up.
Fk , i am gonna need Tim apple to rename to GigaChad ,  so it can save my call man.
Loading up on more uranium if it dips 🥳
Wow just bad earnings after bad earnings
AAPL down after earnings? MSFT could never...
how many of y'all are automating your trading?
So happy I own so much AAPL and AMZN rn
Aapl over sold, can’t wait to buy nore
Google is alphabet so just MAAAN works too
Amzn is glitching like BRK-A was the other day
&gt; You can't trade options. AH is a stock market chat room with no rules and people who post their opinions thinking they're facts. They are not experts, but rather trolls that like to stir up trouble for fun or attention seeking purposes.
[deleted]
Is amazon still in July 2020?
👆🏼this
If you’ve been trading for awhile you know puts on AAPL ER are always the way to go
I was watching the level 2 on it today and it wanted to rocket up so bad... but every time blocks of 2,000 share sells would just \*poof\* knock it back down. The upside of playing AMD is that when the institutions and MMs want it to go up, it goes rockets... when they don't, it's stuck in a locked room in the cellar.
Why the ##fuk would you get my hopes up like that
Lmao that was so obvious after a huge pump

Classic sell the news on AAPL
The Zuck really has lost his fucking mind
I bought $3250 11/5 AMAZON PUTS before close . Tomorrow gonna makbe amazing.Being a 🌈🐻 is the new wave 🌊
If I could trade options AH I would be buying the shit out of this dip. 

A trillion dollar company grows 69% and it dumps?! 

Fake. 

But Tesla gets 1b in sales and it flies to a trillion?

Fake.
AMZN just set up the perfect ODTE for tomorrow. 10000% gain when they announce split
Literally get out the fucking market and come back in 2022. Find a hobby and uninstall the app after closing positions. You’ll thank me later when you see big tech at such a discount
What guidance trick? Mind control J. Powell to print more stimmies to give out to the poors to buy their product?
AAPL has no right being worth what it is.
Spy you dumb bitch, your brother Apple is already rotting
$F isn't a penny stock, but it's been so different lately than it traditionally moves I can't blame them for thinking that way. I'm biased and a holder who buys when it goes under $10 so I'm happy as a pig rolling around in shit today to see it hit above $17.
Lmao did spy really dumped a whole point because amazon and apple got clapped?
Moving to Singapore, got it.
You had the whole year to get into lucid but waited until it ran up 30%? That's on you
Literally what happened
Death by snoo snoo
[deleted]
Big whiff from Amazon.  You clowns bought at ATH. Sea of red tomorrow when tech dips hard.
dumb question, but why do AH and PM exist? I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable and valid reason that isn't just "to scalp retail" which is how it seems from the poor side
Imagine the legend that had 50k puts on aapl and lost it in 2 seconds, you know who i am talking about, you Could hear the soul leaving His body. That would be a nice gain porn.
U can

Need Tim to say something to pull AAPL from the cliff
This dumb bitch
AMZN And now that?

Okay I’m just going to sit back and smoke a blunt
Or WISH
Amazon just gone tank the whole market I see
Glitched.  It's still as red as my wife's boyfriends dick.
Just buy every apple dip they said lmao
With valuations where they are, they better not fucking miss. If the shortage is worse than we expect, we’re going to undergo a hard reevaluation. We’re going to selloff hard.
Amazon just killed my affirm calls
Rotation of AAPL INTO GOOGL
Alright now all the big money needs to move from aapl and amzn to MSFT!
So, seems like the only play left is now MSFT. All other tech is dead. This also means now MSFT has a higher market cap than AAPL, making MSFT the world’s largest company. If the Fed tapers or raises interest rates, the market die literally die.
nah its an ass report bers win
So worse or better please tell me random citizen
FUCK AMZN CRUSH IT
Am I missing something or does everything from AAPL look great and its only dropping because people are selling the news? I mean AMZN's report is actually bad, AAPL looks solid
Praying over these NKLA puts. No reason this shit should be up. Might do a few dumb day trades but that's it, starting the new month fresh on Monday unless SPY does a terrible dip.
The play for tomorrow is to cash out and wait for next week.
AAPL still overvalued
didn't fill such a lame an excuse.
In your experience, does the likelihood of my option selling relate to how cheap it is? I'm afraid no one will be willing to  buy my contracts when I am willing to sell. Happen often?
Anyone just see that LCID jump from 34 to 35.50? That was weird

Anyways they are stop loss hunting. This shit is opening at 50 tmrw, hold the line bois
[deleted]
They were selling off all day if you haven’t noticed
literally chasing vodka with tap water
Just as I load up on Apple….. I’m gonna jump
Off a cliff, holy shit.
QQQ gonna be red for the day soon
Just a little while ago
They don’t….
At least when you are bag holding Apple you don't feel as foolish as apes with Nokia stock.
Well, at least the supply chain is totally fixed. Market can only go up from here!
I’ve been doing a 9 week stock trading project for school and tried to stay away from options to protect my sharpe ratio. This is the last week and I shorted $DWACU thinking it was another ez pump n dump to short, but ended up in last place down -24%. Whelp, I put about 10% of that portfolio in weekly $TWLO puts yesterday and guess who’s in first place now with a 56% return 1 day before the project ends😎. Opshuns r king, fuk shares
#If Tim Apple talks shit about QCOM I will fuck him to death
Meta Materials? 😏
&gt; I think that's a good idea. I'll do the same
AMZN will moon once they announce their EV play. My childhood dream has always been to have an electric car that looks just like the one from Ambiguously Gay Duo.
😭😭 I brought shares tho, so I geuss I'm going to hold for a little. Only did that cause every call I brought in the past week is worth nothing
SQQQ😎
RIP MARKET
Holee fuck AMZN and AAPL gonna lose $250BN+ in market cap tomorrow. SPY can’t over come that
Bought &amp; sold apple calls for quick burger flip. Good thing i didnt hold thru earnings lmao
Asian market shat the bed
People : You can only make money in this market.

Me : False
Bezos, time to press that red button under your desk that’s for emergencies only
How should I prep?
Mine's showing the the same.
FAANG more like BAAGS
Wonder how much AAPL Cathie bought before earnings today
Sold Apple calls before market close, I guess wait until 10am tomorrow and buy them back at discount?
Amazon bears may of spoke to soon
The ER call isn't even over yet
AMZN: please feed more stimmy checks mr gubernment
By when? Tomorrow’s open? Doubt it. Especially the the guidance provided.
**100% $AAPL PORTFOLIO GUH** 🌈🐻📉🍎
Wendy's Twitter admin is funny af
I went 0/3 on earnings plays. How fitting.
Missed on revenue
I bought a macbook air yesterday and the stock still tanked fuck this revenue miss
Tim apple got rekt. Sheesh
Still dont want to call it MANGA?
How do I ban bet that Lucid hits 45 by next week
Don’t worry guys, ABBV reports in the morning
Amazon chart fucked up lol
Yikes. Good thing I have hedges for things like these terrible earnings
Tf did amazon dick just got hard
Apple leaps tomorrow for me
Can I come out of my cave yet? 🐻
Ocgn my only hope now.

Tsla, avenge me 🤑
Well, bloodbath confirmed tomorrow. First Apple miss since 2016
What expiry are you looking at? Dec 150c?
[deleted]
MSFT and GOOG holding up the house.

Hopefully they got big shoulders. 

Tomorrow could be a big sell off with AMZN and AAPL shitting the bed.
Wendy's changing name to Meat. Meet me out back of Meat if you had AAPL or AMZN calls
AMZN FROM THE DEAD!?
AAPL just shit the bed
What the fuck AMZN yeah beautiful bitch
Who here has faith in LCID?
Eps is as expected and revenue is a miss by a bit. Not that bad
I'm thinking AMC will pop right before earnings, in and out.
So they missed a lot on iPhone but actually did good everywhere else is how I’m reading this. Should be good news long term.
Apple never had the makings of a varsity athlete
Can we have a lil correction tomorrow so I can load back on AAPL and AMZN? Thanks
AAPL MISSED?? Oh well, we gappin up tomorrow regardless😴
Aapl
When a company is expected to far exceed predictions any miss is massive
Did AMZN really go back to exactly where it closed..or is this chart fucking up?
TSLA=Value
Imagine buying amazon and apple calls and holding thru earnings….RIP
[deleted]
My AAPL put I bought at close is making me see a color I havent seen in a long, long time.
MSFT biggest company again ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4272)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Time to buy more AAPL it looks like
MSFT too
This sub sucks rn every comment is the same
Good thing the dumpster behind the 7/11 never closes

Why did I buy AMZN shares before ER
AMZN!!!,
Only got 1x 148 FD. Small risk big reward
Tiny tim and dick bezos down 5% each…guh
*Guhhing the air
SPY please ignore AMZN earnings report. Stay green and continue climbing up
HOLD ur fucking breath amzn is back
Well sorry in advance bc they always find a way to keep this shit show afloat
Tbh that’s really not that bad. Analysts were expecting wayyyyy to much imo,
the more you say it the more it hurts
**TIM YOU FUXKING CUCK!! HOW DARE YOU**
Apple and Amazon gonna pull the whole market down tomorrow... LOL
Was nice knowing you aapl
I did ... I was bullish
lmao AMZN down 5%.

They dun' pumped this bitch the past 2 days and dumped the shit out of it.

Some AMZN bears should be rich tomorrow if this holds. Those 5% OTM puts should have been relatively cheap EOD.
Getting double stuffed by AAPL and AMZN...at the same damn time!
That FB pump and dump was wild.
Did you buy those Apple calls I warned you not to buy?
Estimates were high before supply chain fak up
If prices hold until open then MSFT will be #1 tomorrow
Might as well just buy Wish than Amazon at this point
Sbux reversal
Proud father
Good job today Corsair bulls!
A few bricks today
What are the chances that we bounce back on aapl and/or Amzn?
Why do I feel like AAPL has some guidance trick up their sleeves
ITS OVER TMRW

BY meta AND googl
Its not like AMZN and AAPL missed by much.
Looks like market top is in for the forseeable future
They surely due not.
Epic friday. Just a massive rotation from Tech to TSLA.
[deleted]
Wtf Apple
Maybe my EoD puts won’t be so bad after-all, especially if I can roll into some discount buying
Bought 3 shares before
Lol NFLX like "fuck y'all I'm going up"
Since when was FB a pump and dump 😂😂
AMZN changing its name to DSRT
Wen margin call? Anyone get one yet?
Lol what are random spikes and drop in tech stocks. Algos are so confused what to do
Apple Q4 21 Earning Results : 
- EPS: $1.24 (est $1.24)
- Revenue: $83.36Bln (est $84.689Bln) 
- Q4 iPhone Revenue $38.87b, Est. $41.60b

A miss on revenue.
Don't talk to me, or my calls, EVER AGAIN
TANG
Tesla, AMC, Netflix, GameStop
I have 20 SQQQ calls
Who held Amazon through earnings? My condolences
Give it 4 weeks
This the first year I haven’t upgraded to the new iPhone. Just didn’t seem like it was any different. Sorry guys.
[deleted]
Why sell AAPL for 152 when you can wait til after hours and sell for 140?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
We've witnesses Covid come full circle and reward the "going-out" stocks and punish the WFH stocks. Ya love to see it
Nice!  I thought earnings were in the morning though
Entire market crashing
I can't stand the guy, but he's one of the best in the world at running companies. Still a complete douche and glad Musk surpassed him in wealth which made him turn into even more of a douche.
I'm guessing Apple missed earnings
lol the apple earnings dump. Like clockwork
Open the markets back up real quick i needa see something
God speed man
AAPL calls tomorrow it is.
Thx I tailed you 🙏
LCID wut doing bby?
Prepare for economic collapse fuckers. See you at SPY 400
I’m calling it now…in the future all shatty things will be referred to as Meta.
How bad apple missed earnings?
Aapl, amzn, snap, hood,….. all these massive tech companies missing. The top is here boys, the tech run is over.
Yeah almost everything has dumped with earnings this week
Aapl and amzn down so rip Spy tomorrow right
I will light a candle for you. (I also own APPLE)
rip aapl and amzn call holders
Whose turn is it to buy brk.a ?
Me too..  I have so many UVXY itm call options it’s crazy..  if it does happen..  I’m quitting my job straight up
10% haircut
Vix calls and aapl puts will be a nice multi bagger tomorrow
445
Well at least Apple is making a ton of money on services, very good revenue numbers there.
Bro it shot up twice now randomly to green
rip appl
At least you bulls give bears the evening to celebrate before raping us every morning at the bell
That’s why Wish is the way
Well that’s not gone well, has it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Ugh don’t you fucking bitch out on me QCOM I fucking swear to god Tim Apple if you fuck with my calls I’m fucking everyone you love
I hope PFE goes up so my calls are good!
What dumbass bought AMZN right before earnings?  


Couldn't be me
Looks like yer winning rn👍
Nothing like economic data holding the market accountable 🙄
rotation into Disney tomorrow.
Remember back when stocks 🚀 after earnings?

No? 🤔
MSFT #1 market cap at open.

Welcome back to the top.
at this rate will anyone even care if AMZN does a split?
Well, i did say those apple 145 puts as a hedge were dirt cheap
Lmao. 60% gain for calls yesterday and waiting for 200% gain tomorrow for my puts
for who?
You may wanna watch the GUH video
Yes by 1.5 billion
recession
Earnings. They made $5.36 per share for the quarter. Crazy low P/E ratio
[deleted]
Wait, my put actually worked this time?
Rotation into value tomorrow?
Take the day off tomorrow.
We all know SPY gonna open red and then MAANG will rebound and we'll close at 460
# Hungry For AAPLs?
The poor people who thought Ford would reach $18-19 yesterday saw it trade sideways all day today.

Those $17-$19 calls will expire at $0. Maybe for $17 you'll get a $1 profit if you sell before 12pm tomorrow.

Everyone smart knew it was too good to be true. Ford started at 16, fell to 15 before earnings, and shot up back to $16, that's all you get lol.

There was no "soaring" happening. 

Unless you're crazy enough to think Ford will shoot up $3+ tomorrow.
My calls fuk!
It is what it does at earnings.
glad I moved most of my AMZN holdings into SE
About to tell my girlfriend she gonna have to open an onlyfans, ya boy is getting assigned
You gravy
Lol
At least my greedy ass hedged with Apple puts this go round, gaped but not the gapiest
FUCKING MONEY!
I love you ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
That was the sound of millions of spy calls dying
I didn't sell Apple in time. BAG HOLDA
&gt; The market is in a state of chaos. The US, China and Europe are all at risk for an economic recession.
I just hit climax, thank you AAPL, AMZN
[deleted]
Couple years too early huh
Need HIMX to go up 15-20%
Did it twice now, stock split?!
Should have*
So... SPY 450 eow?
I have both 😭
X
Good thing all the money I made today will disappear from AAPL earnings play
Well we are officially in the age of software, welcome bois
Get your apple puts in
You’re fuk like Tim Apple on a Grindr date.
Currently in free fall. -5.5%
Worthless

No shit, woah
Oh no Apple!
Holy fuck. I opened a apple short position. I was called a clown for that. I’m not stupid, you stupid.

Tim, enough with the chip shortage bs. You guys just shit the bed, admit it.
I didn't know I ordered this fucking from AMZN on 1-day shipping. Had to check my account to make sure
What’s with the random AH dumping of every other stock?
Qqq double top fuck
I told like 10 people get Apple puts. I hope they listened.
$HOOD
Why apple die
holy shit Apple missed on Revenue holy shit.
You and I both. 😪 Options will be bloody tomorrow morning
Cary always sells the dip to buy the rip
All the stimmy is gone , puts will print for the next year and two. Same goes for TSLA , right now tons of demand with not enough supply just because tons of millionaires is being printed from shit coin , TSLA stonk and other retards that made money from meme stonks is mostly likely going for a Tesla instead of other brands. I think next year it will be too much supply not enough demand even with the chip shortage.
50% of mine is AAPL ...
Big mistake thinking these 2 down would affect the alphabet. Should of just shorted TQQQ
😂😂😂 thankfully I just bought one. Only gonna have a small loss because I made most of it back day trading today. Maybe 30 dollars
Yeah, I stayed out of the lucid craziness today. 

Translation, I lost on everything.
Glad I didn't get gAPPLED!
how retarded are my 355p SPY for tomorrow?
Thanks AAPL needed that gut punch. Oh well at least my option expires in January

Revenue miss.

Freight costs elevated which is will affect bottom line through the holiday season just after the new product.
welp, wish i didnt sell my aapl 145 puts, made profits off 4 from the iv and held 1 smh
My asshole is obliterated

Spy goes up until it doesn’t and then you only have like 5 mins to sell your puts

Fuuuuck AAPL amd AMZN gonna fuck my gains
Did well in GOOGL only to plunge it all into AMZN LMAO
AMZN right now is why you don't play earnings on the big cap tech.  Just wait for the move and then play momentum.

AMZN is probably going to be sideways at least another 6 months until we get past this inflationary phase with supply shortages/high shipping costs.

They're not going to have the ability to get costs under control until mid/late 2022.
#META by FB sounds retarddd
Amazon and apple no longer faang
I’m retaking my bear exam level 2
I just keep getting more and more push notifications that these big tech companies are missing earnings. I'm scared to look.
SBUX creampied in after hours. ITM calls tomorrow if it dips.

Yes, I know earnings missed, no it doesn't matter in this market. $111 11/19C
CONTROLTHENARRATIVE PUNCHING AIR RN
This is not a fire drill

This was so obvious. Government pumped so much money into the economy last year that personal incomes rose 10% in a "recession" no way earnings were going to keep up without the checks.

Personal income is also highly correlated to house price growth.
Apple takes another step closer to becoming a legacy tech company
Hopefully AAPL and AMZN are somehow bad for TSLA tomorrow
Jay, you’re gonna wanna turn that printer up some more…
Yup
Lost everything on AAPL... again. This stock fucking SUCKS
Who’s the next aapl
aapl fucking us too I see

I knew I should have bought AAPL puts at close.  Fak.

Same as last fall earnings. Classic stunt that will pay handsomely. Puts at close bro
They missed last quarter too

AMZN, Fuked me in a bad way
NASDAQ, SPY DOWN, IWM UP WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE
I’m honestly mind blown that no one on here is talking about $GFS. This will be bigger than $TSMC in 5 years, mark my words
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
Can’t believe we had a 1% day after posting the worst GDP numbers in 3 years and the 2 most exposed FAANG stocks reporting earnings at ATH. This market is bullshit. Bet tomorrow we won’t even get -.5%.
Motherfucking apple I swear to Jesus 

And the worst part is it TRIED to sell my calls but they just didn’t fucking fill. Man this fucking sucks
They don’t do guidance anymore as a rule
Tim cook bout to announce the iPhone 14 tomorrow.

Condolences
Someone tell me how fucked my Tim Apple calls are. I dont know how to read financial reports.
Weak earnings I guess
RIP AAPL
AAPL hasn’t missed on revenue since may 2018 🤢🤮
Oh god, AAPL... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
are otm september 2022 amazon leaps going to be ok tomorrow. Or is it going to be 50% haircut
MSFT really gonna overtake AAPL tomorrow as the most valuable company

What in the fuck
Holy shit Tomorrow gonna be bloody af
Tim 🍎
My spy calls are ded
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) boy we are fucked
I played puts and made $4 today, which is pretty good considering the size of SPY massive green dong. I hate puts and I want to be bullish but every time I go calls they get massacred. One day I will win with calls and reinforce bullish behaviors
At least AAPL didn't drop as much as amzn
AWS is worth about 1.2 trillion on its own rn
AAPL call was the wrong move. Ouch, guess I'm holding til January
But they doubled their China sales
If there’s one thing I’ve learned over the years, it’s AAPL and AMZN Leaps at open.
Holy…. Amazon
Black Friday has arrived.
🤭🍎📉
Why is apple dying?
AMZN gapped down at exactly the time AAPL released earnings
Holy shit no guidance

I can't believe I sold my SPY puts at a loss at the close. FUCK

Wow. I really wasn’t expecting Amazon to miss (no sarcasm). And bad guidance? Really. 20% of my portfolio is Amazon.
Rotation back to the Stone Age tech is 💀
I never play earnings, and the one time I do, I pick Amazon on their first earnings miss of the year.

Apple announced that it's changing it's name to Sour Apple
I'm praying that the money from amazon/apple is gonna move over to meta
Uh oh
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh
AAPL and AMZN just took a big ass dump
Boycotting Apple and amazon for fucking my 10/29 calls
AMC
Well this motherfucker won’t be sleeping tonight. I am jacked to the fucking tits in qqq puts

Great movie. Platoon was just a less artistic remake with the Sheen's son.
AAPL and AMZN, oof
Looks like TESLA is the safe haven stock 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Lidar stock that’s been on some Reddit people’s radar for a while. OUST &amp; AEVA are couple others.
AAPL and AMZN gonna sink this ship
Aapl goes reeeeee
Actually, it’s MAANG now🤓

AAPL died
Rip spy tomorrow fuk
Let’s hope. Otherwise they big fuk
Seriously it’s like, were you not here in 2019 when they dropped 6-10% on earnings two straight times and popped 14% the next time in December.
AAPL  moves SPY
Revs miss
**AAPL GUH**
My gut feeling was to short AMZN  before earning ….
Lesson learned always follow you gut feeling
Just got my shipment of humira and I’m jacked to the tits with Abbvie calls. Lfg
Should sell my aapl before it close...
what do you expect from AAPL
AAPL baby.... wtf are you doing?!
I think we dump tomorrow
[deleted]
We should be worried about Q4 in general. Dumped all my call options contracts today. I'm waiting for the rug to be pulled.
my putttttts on apppppllllllleeeee. :)
Facebook changing its name to Meta has to be one of the worst names they could have come up with. I will not be surprised if they go the way of Myspace and fade into semi-obscurity as well. Still make millions but gonna be toppled by some new social media.
GUH
Hopefully they do 


It is way manipulated
If zuck shaved his head and wore sleeveless shirts, FB would be atleast 1k

Excellent strategy. Pretty sad that it actually works, love missing out on $5 options that balloon to $100+

Dude are you fucking kidding me aapl
Anyone else see amazon shoot up like a mofo?!?!?!
Wtf
LMAOOO LOOK AH
[deleted]
Amazon must be going bankrupt
Jup iam a bit scared for them too
There's the AH drilling!

&amp;#x200B;

0DTE puts on AFRM might be a good play tomorrow.
I was hoping AMZN crashing would do more to SPY
Pmaoo look what’s going on
Right on that, they’ve significantly slowed down.
AMZN still drilling 😵‍💫
[deleted]
Oh god APPL, please! I can only be so fucking erect!
Apple beats but only a little
I bought some spy 455p for tomorrow. Not looking good
Glitch lol
big brain
Rip AAPL
At the rate Amazon is going AH, Apple earnings will either not matter for the market if it moons or add insult to injury if it dumps

EDIT: insult to injury it is
RIP AAPL
Lucid pumping soon cause of rotation
Imagine a stock crawling forever at the same price
gl w/ tsla puts I dumped mine today after a blowout
Quarterly earnings expectations are dumb, but its still funny when tickers get wrecked during them.
If you’re feeling down, just remember some people actually bought more spy calls today
You have a strong point, I just look at AAPL and see the amount of times they’ve split and are doing fine. I wonder if Amazon has gotten too big and if it’s because of Bezos’ greed. You don’t have to be the biggest, you just had to be the best. It’s about the customer and not your own net worth.
😂
Never get anything either of those two touch.
It didn't?
With META you could have done it at work! With friends!
I'm thinking my X 26 ban bet might be safe
Amazon cratering but spy still dgaf
Just sleep through the bell and you might be ayte
0.1200??!
Bruh
Year is 2042: 

Retail took control of the market and is responsible for 90% volume. Hedgefunds  went bankrupt short ladder attacking GME years ago causing a massive crash comparable only to the crash of 1929. Millennials are now the boomers and Generation Z do not trust any firm to have control of their investments. GME acquired FAANGs on the same day with an all stock purchase. SPY moves 10% on an average day. TSLA price is ♾ and is overvalued. PLTR still trades slightly below $25 a share, and CRSR is still undervalued.
VISA?
Dude Timmy you fucking lazy bastard dump the numbers already we need that rush
On the bright side, I can claim the 3k AMD loss on my taxes
[deleted]
Ah today was a good day made what I used to earn in a year in one day 🤑
well tomorrow is going to suck. no good for any of us when these giants miss, especially this badly!
Well stick me in a dress and call me sally, that was a rough day.
Amazon looking good after the split
Hmm now this is interesting. 

QCOM, NVDA, INTC have the same drop/spike in their AH charts.

The safe spaces on campus, all that crap, has spilled out into the workplace. This baby should have been killed in its crib.
AMZN better say they are doing a stock split
Is NNDM still a buy?
Finally the true king 👑 of the "Greeks", Meta.  🤣
Apple almost always drops after earnings despite doing well. Gl to call holders
[deleted]
Damn all stock goes down after market
Fuck this Amazon bullshit I'm going back to shopping in person at Walmart. You can find me in the one open register next to the zombied out dope head.
Spy 460 was the play a month ago.
Groundbreaking announcement seeing as how it’s basically the same company to begin with
Same. I’m nervous enough with my aapl shares. Couldn’t imagine if I had options
Amzn going back to 3000
I don’t know. One?
You guys never learn for ER 😂
That’s probably why they are never delivered.
#DATA
At this rate AWS is getting spun off
Who said AMZN dropped 7% last time so this time will go up ? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Fucking pray for my spy calls cuz theyre going in the trash tomorrow
I am so horny… thank god I’m off work in 30 mins so I can go home and rub one out 

#META
Would someone please give me a golden fuckboy award? I haven't seen one of those given out in way too long
Better than cocaine, better than sex
Everything has been hyperbolic this earnings quarter. So AMZN will lose over 20% over three trading days
He is 🤡
NOOOO CAT what have you done to me
Amazon whales rotating into AAPL if they do well
A duck
Exactly this is a over reaction rn in after hours
Your Amazon calls

Whoah this AH is crazy!

It’s all over the place
QCOM gave me a heart attack with that half second drop below today’s open
almost Every tech stock dumping on ER
Went full ape today, you want the stock to run you don't be a dip buying pussy

Bought 50 shares of the top of lcid repeatedly and I'll do it again tmrw
Thank god I don’t fuck with options
Fun fact: TSLA fruit bois says that TSLA is not a car company. But blows up the stock price on a minor 100k order on CARS.

#AMZN calls TOMORROW FOR THE WIN

Lol AMD after hours. These motherfuckers are so sketch. It’s going to rip once they get all their rich frat boys on board
Thinking about selling all my Apple shares and rotating into MSFT. AM I RETARDED?
aapl will jump 5% to counteract amzn plunge
This is the least amount of stuff I’ve ever gotten from Amazon. Quality has gone way down.
3 more min

Algos getting so impatient with Apple. Up down up down.

Enjoy your 2x-2.5x bagger which is nothing lol
NRDS up and coming IPO, lots of potential for growth
“The horror…the horror…”
Amzn trying to ruin the bull party huh
Apple gonna dump like the rest of tech. But only a lil dump
Amzn dropped the ball. Sbux caught it
Same, I think tmrw is nuts, going long shares as well
Was it in the litter tray ?
Damn that’s 2 quarters of earnings misses in a row for amazon
After last earnings report, not even fazed by this one
I mean unless it's ITM it's tough to say.

Premiums were rich already at ~$14 before close

I'm sure at opening IV it'll print tho given a -4% gap down is plenty

Edit: well nvm its deeper itm now lol
Glad I took profit on fb calls
The rush I get during earnings. I love it!
Same. Good news is I can save money on toilet paper by just using my paper hands instead
AMZN is not even up 1% YoY it’s officially a boomer stock
Wtf did plug do AH
I moved apartments 6months ago and havent had one tinder match since then. There is no way i’m that ugly. The girls around here are ugly anyways
Tim Apple making everyone wait all this time just to announce they shit the bed too. Ya hate to see it
Why? I want buy dips
Any day now Tim apple

Man fuck these after-hours assholes. Just leave shit alone
Damn. Doing them dirty
We’ve also seen these prices for a year. Shits lame and stagnant.  Your missing out on gains leaving it in that boomer stock
Jon Najarian bought AMZN $3500c expiring tomorrow 💀🤣
I hope a lot because they’ll make their money back. Right?
[deleted]
[deleted]
Depends on aapl. If they miss too, then yeah, tomorrow is rough
I bought calls for the first time in a while, so I'm hoping it does.
Good thing I bot those AMZN puts before close
AMZN calls tomorrow For sure
Why did CAT just take a shit?
I will be buying even more ocgn. I live and breath ocgn get it guys. Get it
I love Josh
Sold all my F before earnings. Kept all my AMZN. 

Just fuck my shit up
Don't just gloat. Fucking banbet it
At least three bucks.

Re: Amazon - You guys are forgetting AWS and their ad business are still growing incredibly fast
We only made 6$ per share, but that is because we had a One time expense buying “X” which is already more functional and better designed than Metaverse.
Ah look at that, good ol X had a nice earnings pop. I forgot that SOB even existed lol
Nah, Apple is going to fuck your Apple calls
Yeah, and last earnings they actually beat on EPS.
400 by EoY.
Short answer yes. Long answer yeah!
[deleted]
SPAC’s. Lots of plays out there
In a drunken stupor i bought spy puts yesterday instead of calls. Rip $500
Man can AMZN rebrand to something quick so they'll stop sucking balls!?
Stfu. It missed earnings.
Decembrrr
Is AMZN going to crash the market?
TSLA always makes its big moves over the weekend next week we eat
Good company for semiconductor exposure, profitable and undervalued as fuck, possible merger with kioxa and they suspended their dividend around covid times and they should pull a Ford sooner or later and reinstate it
You guys think my 453/454/458/459 Iron Condors I sold today will be fucked tomorrow?  Basically I just need SPY to not go up anymore
Damn. WISH put AMZN out of business
Double edged candles on the chart. There's nothing getting it to $50 tomorrow. It will sideways and you'll be mad.
How much is Teslas software revenue?
Ok Amazon that’s enough thank you
I swapped for called last week I feel stupid badly
Why’s it running
Felt lucky to drop my AMZN bags at $3300, they're someone else's problem now
For your sake I hope it's true but that was a big oof earnings man.
i usually go for something with delta between .2-.4
Yeah true that.
700k is like salary for 3 mid level silicon valley employees lol.
Stock split
Amazon just keeps going down
[deleted]
Sassy Jassy
AFRM to $165 tomorrow
AAPL doesn’t miss. The Gyna growth alone is enough to double the market cap in 3 years.
Nice bro I went from 9k to 18k and sitting at 15.1 now 200 shares avg cost $30 before today I was avg cost 25. I kept buying the dips :D
kking
We haven’t seen these prices on amzn since Monday 😱
how much are the 3300 10/29s gonna be worth tomorrow?
AMZN gapped down ~10% last earnings, let’s see how this plays out
Come on Apple release the kraken already
I pray it does😂
Lol you mean how many are still bagholding when they bought it at 60 this past winter lol
Ok so AMZN has a chance then tomorrow
Stock split stock split
It's going to sink tomorrow when the money rolls to METAAAAAA
LFG MVIS
That’s why he wants to escape to space
Somebody bought Amazon puts. Show yourself. Come get your accolades.
For the record, he is making money off you stupid ape strength buying shares
We have decided to produce our phones in the US for living wages. -70% lol
shouldn't it be 300million people ( which is every one of us) $1 million?
Bezos jumped ship at the right time. Left the dumpster fire for what's his face
Cope
Lmao rip my amazon calls
🤞. 

Going to play it took morrow.
Is Amazon going to fuck my Apple calls?
Is the census that it will keep going?
Only thing to save Amzn tomorrow is a split. Cmon new CEO this is your chance!

One would think FB gonna go up. Fuk
Who’s Facebook?
Us treasury called dibs already
Good shyt 👍
5pm is the call
Prolly just like, watch some candlesticks. Then draw some trend lines if anyone is watching.
You may be on to something here....
Bulls watching AMZN pre market: ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
1b valuation lmao
Unless you own puts 😈
I like those odds.
Some are confused why SPY didn't drop when Amazon dropped, this line of questioning shows lack of trading and ETF knowledge.

Of SPYs holdings, the top 10 stock amount from over 1.30% to over 6% of the etfs value. Amazon is one of these ten but more than half the rest are up. 

Then for the other 90% more than half of them are up, together on average, 6%.

67% of the entire SPY went from being up 7%+ peak today, to 4%, which is still up. The rest of the stocks that were down, including amazon, did not remove all the gains.

People here think that one piece falling makes the whole castle turn to jello. Sorry, but you need to go back to your .0093% savings account and leave trading to the pros if you're that misinformed.

With those savings accounts with $1000 invested, you may earn $5 in interest in 50 years. Whoo.
Wtf TEAM you killed it. Market really loves that stock.
Not if they can't keep supply chains moving
Wow huge miss for AMZN but it only goes down 4%?!
Meta 340 🙏
Goodbye Octobrrr.

&amp;#x200B;

Say hello to Novembear.

&amp;#x200B;

Decembear is warming up.
MAANGDINGO
I agree. There's no reason to have money in AMZN right now with 16 months of stagnation and a hundred other companies with better growth prospects. Where do they go from here? Was the pandemic the company's peak?

A split could save them but won't happen, imo.
Algos fucking around
Are twilio calls a good idea?
Amazon has officially been my most costly stock ever
Show me on the doll, where did Bezos touch you
Amazon got me last me ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
I think you’re safe.
Everyone inversed themselves as was suggested by WSB
Amazon is a garbage stock lol boomer company like Viacom and Intel now 😂
People are supposed to grow tf up after college, not bring that baby shit to the workplace.
I only want the ones that go 380k -&gt; 10k
not sure, i think people just want to get out of the house and go shopping in stores. it's probably a q2 22 play
2.8 million in puts for 32 strike bought before bell.  What you think?
LCID gain [porn](https://i.imgur.com/J9zXMZB.jpg)

Hedged with puts at the top than doubled down on calls at 33, I can't lose tmrw. Raking it in on the volatility too.

/r/wallstreetbets: TIME TO BUY AMZN
TSLA&gt;AMZn
I’m a bull but I bought 3 aapl puts at close only because of their garbage music choices for their advertisements
i should just inverse my self fucK
The whole market should now pray that AAPL doesn't miss
best tech that nobody uses, too.
No
How many millionaires were made with Lcid today
Very spicy
Let this be a lesson. Only buy companies that sell promises and not actual products.
✋
What was the bull case for them? Just curious
what are the first letters of the tickers? trash comment
That's some hot garbage numbers. 👀
I thought it was 5pm ET?
Go X!
Puts tonight, calls tomorrow.
Does Facebook run anymore tomorrow or did i buy top
I got aapl puts so it’s prob going to rip up 20 handles
Oh Look, TEAM wins again
Usually every quarter is their biggest ever, stock tanks.  Then goes back up in a week.
&gt; I have a suggestion for you.
If AAPL misses is there any hope left??
Anyone going in on the FazeClan SPAC Merger??
GOOG
Spy barely budging
Bezos: ok that bastard Elon overtook me in networth this week. Just need some spicy earnings to get Amazon up and me back number one

AMZN: *earnings and revenue miss, down 4% after hours*

Bezos: 🤡🔫
i'd say automatic U-TURN don't even have to wait a few days
Go on then big dog, what should I throw my cash at next?
Sell AMZN buy Meta you noobs
Everything about Zuckerbot’s new ticker symbol, including the meta-obsession is due to constant rejection by women.
He will be the next twitter dumb ass that will have the SEC and feds knocking on his door with his P&amp;D shit
Or 300000 ppl, $1M.  That’s still a pretty comfortable retirement
Lol entitled generation
HOW FAR, first two fucking words you idiot. HOW FAR.
Amzn may scare aapl
Can someone explain why TDOC shit the bed AH yesterday but has a massive green dildo today?
Good on ya... gonna tank tomorrow unless it pulls a Shopify.

If Apple results are shitty which I expect... good chance the whole market takes a massive, greasy deuce tomorrow.
He could give every person alive $38
Oh AMZN

Earnings: $6.12 vs $8.92 per share expected

Revenue: $110.81 billion vs $111.6 billion expected
He moved on to making penis pumps that go to space.
[deleted]
Soo, aapl was the right choice i guess
Those AMZN weekly calls weren’t cheap. Now they are though
The whole market is waiting on Tim Cuck to report
🥺 F
Sold my SPY calls 3:59. Feeling genius RN
I can see it now. Tim Apple announces his own fucking metaverse. FB -8.5% at open
#Ban Bet Won
---

/u/NoHelpisComing (1/0) made a bet that AMZN would go to 3350.0 when it was 3438.26 and it did, congrats retard.
$AMZN.  Ouch.  Them some turrrrible earnins
Actually missed earnings bigly.
Come on Timmy why you gotta blue ball us like this
Hope sooner .1200 by next week
lets see what lcid does tomorrow . So many calls bought today its crazy
W. Tang
OCGN pleas go to $20 tomorrow
OK. Let that big money flow from Amzn to metaaaaaa.


Come on now. Zucks waiting.
Got eem, but Amazon isn’t going anywhere anytime soon I’m not stressing it, they are only expanding
Amzn has not seen these price levels since 4 days ago
If AMZN would've announced a stock split, I guarantee that this mf'er would recover in a few days. Unfortunately, it didn't, so RIP to my sniggily-diggily 🛐
you can buy options that are not OTM?
😂
I rode calls and shares all day, bought puts at the top, than doubled down on calls at the bottom

If [this is what ](https://i.imgur.com/MPD7XC3.jpg) bagholding looks like than sign me up
I've not made a single correct choice all earnings season. Even FB turned around and fukt me.

I swear someone checking my account and changing the numbers based on what I bought
Should ve bought amzn puts :(
MSFT
4000c we’re seriously selling for $1.

No words. 🤣
Doesn’t Amazon miss make Google and Microsoft that much more impressive? MSFT 330c and GOOGL 3000c 10/29
Zuckerberg probably stole the idea from some harvard student
Daaammmnnn    MANG
My AMZN position, RIP
Wtf is MVIS?
Lucky you listened yikes
They literally lowered guidance for Q4
Brooo Amazon needs to split already
MarketWatch says a move of $4.16 in either direction compared to the average $5.82.
amzn should think about paying a dividend. Ut'w not like they can grow more
😂😂😂😂
Can someone tell me which part of Nasdaq has had good earnings??
I finished up today up 0.17%.  Not 17.0% ....0.17%.

Everything is coming up Millhouse.

NYT article on Gen Z employees is hilarious 

“Ali Kriegsman, 30, co-founder of the retail technology business Bulletin, wasn’t sure, in the past, how to respond when her Gen Z employees insisted on taking days off for menstrual cramps or mental health: “Hey I woke up and I’m not in a good place mentally,” went the typical text message. “I’m not going to come in today.”
So would they tax Bezos's unrealized capital gains as of today, or tomorrow?
FAANG should be MAANG. This message is approved by the mango man
In stock maybe.
This guy has mentat training
Amazon tanking. Of course.
What about Amazon?
AMZN hurting but Christmas is on the way, they’re going to destroy earnings in the 4thQ
LCIDs movement today is big news! Also the release of the Lucid air coming. Opening of the factories in my town.. and oh ya, degenerates like to gamble and the call option chain is bananas.
Does AH/PM count for banbet?
Tesla @1300 MINIMUM by mid December. I made a huge bet with a buddy of mine. I‘ll come here to gloat. 

In the meantime PLEASE downvote me.
No I’m not that special
Welcome to the party
And it'll moon the moment I sell

How did you get out of that banbet?
Elon Musk is worth $300 billion. That's enough to give 300 people $1 billon.

All this week alone. I’ve spammed every single one of my plays too. 😘
I was about to buy AMZN but my feelings said no.
MSFT on the way
Not yet 😉
WDC fucked me lol
Turns out there are a ton of companies the SP cares about and they are doing well. Who would have thought!?
amzn has obviously reached its peak, there is no where else to go, nothing else to do that someone already hasnt done better. 

only way from here is down or flat
How about them earnings this week....
Amazon didn’t beat earnings. No wonder.
Lesson learned, never hold calls through earnings.
Replace F with M
Replace G with A
Remove Netflix and add Tesla

Not selling MVIS calls was not smart
Got a few my self, may it drill into oblivion
LFG HIMX LETS SEE U DO THE THING
50% in 1dte?
Offloading my FWRD options, hopefully.

Small spike today on earnings...not what I hoped for, but gainz is gainz, as they say.
Lol..nope
AMZN will probably be 10% down by open
Rip Bezos
Let me know when u fund out
bear ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
People here have made more than that
How far OTM are you guys generally willing to go to pick up cheaper option contracts?

Don't be surprised if it tanks tomorrow then bounces on Monday
Lmao yup

Never happened
Lmfao that pump to stave off getting ass blasted by MVIS shitty earnings.

This company is a bag of glass
In this case, supply chain issues save lives
It doesn’t get better.
Alphabet's ticker is still GOOG, what an absolutely trash comment.
That's because SDC's actual value is the same size
Watch them pull out a stock split to save the day lol. I think revs were inline its the eps that was way off, but memory serves stuff like thats happened before when they building their workforce and generally investing into their company. 

Agree though, conf call will be interesting.
You must be new to this. AAPL has always reported at 4:30. Because they are special.
TDOC down 5% ah and then up 7% today was an emotional ride
430 like always
[deleted]
IV?
WDC missed earnings and I sold my LCID 2 days ago at a 45% loss. I fuckin suck at this.
Amazon announces 10:1 stock split leading to massive V shaped recovery
Some retard probably got paid millions of dollars to come up with Meta
Tell me how. Honestly. Tell me what the earnings call might say to reverse a 4.3% walloping.
Amazon 😂
AMZN gonna be dead money. Nothing can move the stock higher
Thew. Then I‘m relieved. Thanks!
Thats the mistake people always make. Gotta leave some cash to buy down if shit goes sour
Seeing AMZN miss earnings is an amazing sight when I’m not the one holding calls on it
Amazon just became an Olympic diver
Its not worth twice as much as ford you retard. (maybe tomorrow thought) Is amazon worth 23 times more than Apple?
Based on options pricing, the expected move in AAPL is $3, which is basically flat.
[deleted]
Marky Z please let my calls print tomorrow 🙏
EV charging companies having a good run too
This news just in —

A bankrupt car rental company to acquire AMZN at a discount.
think about it...meta trading down for the past few months, lots of room to run up ATHs...
HUT is looking passable looking damn passable .
Let's go Tim Apple!
Would a split and additional volume have any effect on the share long term tho? Splits are non-events in and of themselves, the only reason they tend to align with upward trends is companies split on the way up. AMZN has been in range for like a year, unlike NVDA for instance.
Only thing that they can save them is stock split.

Anything other than that will just crush amazon more.
Apple changing name to Watermelon
Even if the beat earnings I think any reference to supply chain issues in Q4 will see them open down tomorrow.
Mvis 700k revenue , a single daytrader makes more than that , 1.5B mcap btw , actually worse since they have 9M net loss so anyone that hasn't lost more than 9M made more than them
Apple never misses estimates but that doesn't mean stock goes up every time they report.
After a 1% day too
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Yeah thankfully I still have a couple of weeks left on my calls.
[deleted]
SDC Is the play. I can feel it in my tiny penis
For a little more than a year!
It'll hit and still drop.
Aapl earnings when
When’s Apple releasing their shit?
ER is out at 430
Imagine buying Amazon calls when last earnings the stock dropped 10% I don’t even feel bad because I tried to warn you, post loss porn
East Coast time?
“Facebook is now META, what happens to FANG?” 


Google is fucking Alphabet and it’s the G in FANG so probably absolutely fucking nothing, what an absolutely trash article.
I meant to buy puts before close because I remembered last Amazon earnings. Was busy with work so I missed that, but may still buy some tomorrow. 

I always want stocks to go up, but i think we're going back to $440
They should
4:30
It's not really dropping that much
How did you get out of that banbet?
Bad $WDC guidance
all the important companies will be done with earnings this week, prepare for incoming dump. 

buy the fucking dip
BORN IN 1964, STOCK IS GOING THROUGH THE FLOOR   
ITS JEFFREY. JEFFREY BEZOS
Yeah. I got out close to ATH with my calls losing barely anything this morning. Yesterday's close allowed me to buy down my position. Still, I didnt fall for that pump at today's close.
it's MU. Also, ddr4 prices falling.
[deleted]
I was able take the opportunity to make few thousands on FB ‘s upswing. Sold with $7.25 profit .now rebought at $315.35
Apple waited for Amazon to hand in its test and is changing its answers
So buy the AMZN dip right?
[deleted]
Unless Tesla hard carries EVs tomorrow, I think the big earnings news puts any rally on hold til next week
I got insider news for you. LCID is planning to buy AMZN
Have amazon earning out yet?
AMZN you POS
Spy only down .09% and AMZN not even hitting weekly low off that. Market is a meme but this is mind boggling
Amazon about to get fired from FAANG.
Haha, ok
Guess more ropes will be purchased on AMZN tomorrow
amazon call holders holding up cardboard signs on the streets tmrw
Calm you tits, guys. AAPL doesn't report till 5pm EST.
People break losing streaks?
I’ll say third times a charm
$3445... a smooth $6295....

Expiring morrow.
Will Elon fuck me or the bears tomorrow?
Iv
Oh but they are in retail
I mean stock have been higher in the past, and they deliver theirs firts cars this wkd, it wont plummet that hard if it ever will
I swapped for called last week after it hit resistance
Spy big RED tomorrow, not a bear by any means but too green today
Share price is too expensive and they’ve been stagnant for the past 6 months. Either they split or we are going to see a massive sell off.
Irish cream cold brew certified BUSSIN
NIO pleasantly surprised me today. let's go 41.30 tomorrow baby ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
I’m praying to our lizard overlord that this is true
Buy dips
Brandon efforts and basic human freedoms slowly being allowed by our masters says yes
Elon did
LCID to run again tomorrow?
Apple stop teasing
I have 458Ps for the opening dip and 460Cs for the inevitable pumpage tomorrow
CEO, ENTREPRENEUR, BORN IN 1964
Seriously. Time to sell everything, go 100% UPRO, and look at the account 10 years later.
I get Amazon but why is MU crashing?
Look I’m going there, CNBC has been hit or miss for a long time. Recently they’ve been incorporating a more diverse mix in they’re analysis. With that said, @CNBC pls test market you’re analysts to see if they’re comprehensible.
Amazon ain’t fucked yet, earnings call at 5:30

Could pull a massive V shape
Gonna ride these nvda $250c down to the wire tomorrow. Thing needs to blow up in the AM so I can sell and go about my day.
Why would you ever hold calls through ER? Do you hate money?
If I was a real boy…. I woulda bought Amazon puts.
Aapl earnings ok?
I’m with you. 140 tomorrow.
my 11/5 puts hope so
Lmao AMZN.
SKLZ will pump

DEAD MAN WALKING

Did a $117 ban bet on SBUX before close. 

✌️
Bag holder eh? Bought at the top?
Waiting for AAPL to give a gut punch to me.
Ron Artest changing his name to Facebook World Peace.
I wanna see all the loss porn from those guys who were buying AMZN $4300cs 

Show me the good stuff
Cry a little,  take a nap,  repeat
N o s h i t
I got long dated calls and a couple pussy ass puts as a fake hedge, I’m just not liking the drop right after close
This is what you get for only selling $110B worth of product you stupid bitch
Wtf why did you not sell today
Are there any bears left? Please let us know when the last of you guys throws in the towel.
Alright I've had AAPL stock for 4 years now. My prediction for tomorrow close is down $8.

More lcid
Stocks only ever go down when you buy calls.
word thanks!
AMZN gonna climb back up to $3400 by next ER and then drill again. Rinse and repeat. 

I hope Jeff Bezos falls into a vat of battery acid.
Gold plated yachts don’t grow on trees!   Operating expenses.
This is your LCID entry, 50+ incoming tmrw. 

When Tesla runs like that historically it happens 70% of the time on back to back days. 

I think LCID follows suit
XOM killing it on earnings pre market tomorrow. Right mayne? Right? My 1DTE are scared
AMZN dead money for 15 months. Worse adjusted for inflation.
Large caps really are the future huh. 

"in the fourth quarter, we expect to incur several billion   
dollars of additional costs in our Consumer business as we manage   
through labor supply shortages, increased wage costs, global supply   
chain issues, and increased freight and shipping costs—all while doing   
whatever it takes to minimize the impact on customers and selling   
partners this holiday season. It’ll be expensive for us in the short   
term, but it’s the right prioritization for our customers and partners"

AMZN barely reacted
I’m a licensed advisor and have been doing this six years.  Today I saw Tesla 500p 11/5 coming through for practically nothing and said fuck it and bought some. Despite Tesla rising nearly 4 percent today my puts are up over fifty percent. 

I have no idea why this is happening.
Ah, fair enough and good point. Good luck to you friend!
Drinking one glass of water for Amazon 4000c holder, stay hydrated homie, life goes on
Amazon FDs. Going to go the same way as SHOP did. We are going to be green as fuck tomorrow.

Sold*
Amazoned out of the calls.
LRC 🚀
In hindsight maybe putting my entire IRA into AMZN at $3700 was a bad move 🤡
Thirties.  Three friends to speak of.  Two of them just had children.  Basically down to one now.
Whatever just gonna keep adding more AMZN every paycheck 🤷‍♂️
have an iron condor for AMZN and I STILL GET FUCKED
[deleted]
AMZN has been stagnant for the past 6 months. The share price is too expensive for the average investor. I really think they should consider a split at this point in time.
Welcome to America where we roll the cars downhill to lure investors and there are companies like Lucid ( havent seen a car on road ) worth almost as much as Ford GG
Yep, I feel like I outgrew most of the people my age. Kinda feels good tbh
Metarrhea
Imagine buying options into ER instead of selling them.
Why did DIA shoot up in the last 30mins?

I bought puts right before that ☠️☠️
4:30 and then 5:00 for the call I believe
SHOP did too but look at what happened today
Dam didn’t see AMZN tanking AH after ER. 

Not like they’ve done it the past like 9 quarters. 🤡
gonna scalp some $amzn 0dtes
I bought a few debit spreads at close
Nope.
A post earnings dump is pretty common. They’re 1dte, not saying I think the bull run is over, just that tomorrow might be red. Also I’m not the only one buying puts, look at the volume for 1dte puts today vs calls
Well Amazon is dead
Wat abut FD poots?
Spy and QQQ pouts
Calls shares and puts purchased at the top, all bigly green
Where's Tim Apple
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/thesippycup** bet **AMZN** goes from **3446.54** to **3100.0** before **2021-11-18 16:14:13.876411-04:00**

Not if they keep crashing like yesterday
Bruh, so unreal
I’d shit and cum
&gt; Tesla's market cap is $50.8B, Amazon's is $519B
It is tho
I have resorted to praying to God to crash these markets and save my puts
8% of my account is AFRM $155c expiring tomorrow.
Last night was forever ago.  Today’s close looking like a bull trap
🐸🐸🐸PROG will be appearing on the  PODD Conference tomorrow. I’ll be watching that very closely 🐸🐸🐸
When does AAPL post?
Any hope for LCID 40 tomorrow?
I ded
FB CALLS
BB
More like Beta lol
How wild would it be when teslas market cap surpasses amazons??? 😂😂
Is that a real theory
I'd like for it to not, so I could be right for a change, but we'll see.
Holy shit if Apple misses… bulls fuked
did anyone buy amazon puts?
I D I O T !
MVIS misses
Where is my damn $X earnings
That’s some sleazy chit mang
Amazon 90 degree angle $140~ drop.

Amazon has tons of connections, and conducts legally questionable activity and partnerships, if they couldn't get around the supply chain and profit margin problems it means trouble.
Dumped to almost the same price right before the meta pump. Crazy.
They're losing money in their core business and haven't improved their site since 1995
RIP Amazon
meta prly gap up and open around 330
Mang im broke
oh yahhh this is a championship TEAM
I meant to exit my TSLA calls before close, but got busy at work.

Time for a coin flip.
AMZN about to be the holiday shopping recovery play.
Why are you buying puts right now? Consolidation was September October we are back to idiotic bull runs for no reason
God I hope so
Unusual call buying on FCEL, chart looks like it’s stable, little bit of the old gubmint magic and sympathy for the EV sector and up we go? Maybe? Perhaps? Plz?

/u/Lujmina (1/0) made a bet that BYND would go to 100.0 when it was 93.42 and it did, congrats retard.

Google and teladoc didn’t miss EPS that bad. I think it’s bleeds tomorrow. It’s too slow to keep you money sitting all year to get a 2% gain.
Tried to get an even ratio of Puts to Calls, but prices spiked out of nowhere, lol.

I'm heavier on Calls at a 3:2 Call to Put ratio. Yikes.
Ok MU please go down more so my straddles print
This is more fun than Cesar's.

Also, I'm in danger.

Starbucks change name to Luckin coffee?

damn, amzn shitting the bed. The worst part is that this will give delusion fuel to the apes that think gme is on the way to overtake it.
Andy Jassy 0-2 for earnings reports?
Aapl drill or bigly up?
Right here with you buddy, let’s our assholes rejoice

I bought 10/29 aapl puts today
Imagine missing with lowered expectations 🤡🤡
Bro. How the tf fb dump so hard. Fuk this. Fuk
It’s looking grim buddy . You holding calls?
Alpha males build rockets 

Beta males build metas
With how anemic volume has been all week all it would take for the entire market to drop massively would be a little push.  


Amazon just gave it that push.
[deleted]
Oh man my boss is screaming about Amazon. Even the guys with the big bucks get their teeth kicked in trying to play earnings heh heh
*It's possible we are in a completely fraudulent system*
Exactly, low volume selling ah really got me
Link?
They crushed in Feb and nothing. So they miss today and nothing? Please?
The Amazon groundhog saw its shadow, 6 more months of range bound in the low/mid $3000s
That’s pretty weak amzn
Yeah. Why? You want to start a fight or something, huh?
Can totally see COIN being a $500b - $700b company in 5 years.
QCOM you better break through god damn 134 resistance tomorrow
He hasn’t been in charge for a year now
Call aint over
That’s not good. Better sell before profit. Don’t wanna pay taxes
Bears are like that fly that gets trapped in your apartment, tries to leave through closed windows and keeps hitting their head on the window again and again and still won't learn.
Guess I should've sold my FB calls.
oh lord
Lmao you saw that. What a HUGE fucking miss 🤡🤡
You might want to sit down for a minute and take some time
Amzn and apple
SQ is such a beast
What? Bullshit
Imagine holdings calls into aapl and amzn earnings 🤡
Any hope for LCID 40 tomorrow?
BERS still fuked tomorrow
Andy ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
thumbs up to the 7 fig Amazon seller guy who said Amazon was fucked
Something tells me that Amazon missing EPS by such a large margin and THEN readjusting their Q4 guidance to lower than expected means it's going to fucking drill into the iron core of the earth.
Amazon puts
Last night was 100% a bear and put trap. Sorry for those people who held over night. SPY pac man that red.

Which bears were being dicks yesterday so dont mind
Diversification?
Is anyone else in their 20s and friendless?
Institutions expecting bad move most likely. My leverage in calls are tiny let’s see what happens
Hertz just announced a deal to buy Amazon's failing business.
&gt; The first time I found a calculator, it was on the back of an envelope.
My AMZN call spreads didnt fill. THANK FUCKING CHRIST
So is fang gonna become mang now
It really was doe. It really do be like that sometimes.
Lucid name change to Flaccid
I have 69 let’s hope it holds
I chickened out as well.  Instead took what I would have bought in AMZN puts and went with SPY puts.

&amp;#x200B;

Not certain if that was right either but it's near the money (right now) so I don't think it'll get crushed as bad as a miss on AMZN
But but GME bad
This aged terribly
[deleted]
Anyone still looking at Microvast MVST? Hopped on in with 7% gain today, maybe shorts are reevaluating that 135% borrow fee...
This is the 4th day SPY/QQQ  had another quick drop just entering into ah. Nearly the same way.

That means there's pressure to push them down when cash activity slows and volume drops.

Which means something is propping these up during the day, and if that is reduced or removed both will be pushed into the pavement.

With such weak earnings on average, they have been propped by shady institutions and retail investors focusing on mainly 7 stocks. 7 stocks can't hold forever.

Tapering soon. Stock shortages guarantee Q4 will be worse than Q3, lack of product stock and holiday sales don't push much profit when together.
Damn... Amazon shit the bed.

I hope no one bought FD's for tomorrow.

When I looked last the $3450's were going for 6k....
Good thing is sold my shitbucks call two weeks ago ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
i'm disappointed the Lizard King Zack renamed Facebook Inc to Meta. FB will MOON if renamed to LizardBook Inc.
Cathie save me. Buy this AMZN dip
You got something here!!! 😂
Numbers should be out any time now
Bezos getting ready to change company name to Meta.
DCA into riot $28 December calls
Someone just tell me my LCID leaps will be okay
Why does big money have to manipulate us retards out of a couple hundred bucks?
Will come back
Fucking Apple, make my 250 dollar puts into 2500. Hope releasing the same Iphone for 3 yrs stopped consumerism.
Well it's not the case now. Nothing will save AMZN tomorrow 🤣
my portfolio have swung from +120k to -20k to +700 now. sitting this out for a while.

just kidding i be back next week
Don't need Amazon when I can get everything I want in the Meta.
Been keeping an eye on Starbucks.
And if you order now we’ll throw in a free medium sized body bag.
Hadn't read the earnings report when I posted, just saw the AH reaction
Ne1 holding amazon bags?
what time they at
LCID Puts
Amazon just needs to use slave labor to move the boxes like apple does.. this isn’t hard you’d think the execs would figure this out
But they did better than expected. Amazon lowered guidance last quarter and still struggling
This Australian fuck doing the live amzn call is great.

It’s like listening to crocodile hunter, he’s talking like it’s animals.

He may just be imitating Steven Irwin.

It’s silly
Amazon sucks. Might as well put your money in the bank at that rate.
What’s the likelihood we see -2% tomorrow. It’s only right.
Press S to spit on Bezos
Fuck
At least my AMZN shit was shares. Big F for the call buyers.
Hopefully cashing out my TSLA 1050 and 1100 calls tomorrow 😬
Does Amazon announce a split?
Since Elon is African American, can he say the forbidden word?
I'm kicking myself for getting too caught up in the Tesla train cause I went into this week ready to open some wide call credits on Amazon for earnings and completely forgot about it
[deleted]
Well, I’m getting pretty close to having completely blown up my account. I got a few lotto tickets for tomorrow, some 1dte 455p’s and 456p’s. Praying we fucking take a huge post earnings dump tomorrow so I can at least get back on the road to recovery. Honestly I would be happy with just a small win on this one just to break my losing streak
AMZN certified garbage stock. This company has no future.
Wuhwoh
Glad I straddled spy Holy shit
WDC just murdered MU by proxy
Amazon still making tons of money. In terms of long term investment they are going to dominate.
They have no choice now
Hopefully they sold a ton of iPhones and give positive guidance
Mango?
I don’t know why I’m surprised by this LCID rug pull. But then again we’re only 9 minutes into AH.
$125 now

AAPL and AMZN earnings in 2021:

Q2 both down  
Q3 both down

Its not too late to buy spy puts!
Amazon call holders can buy free ropes from amazon.

Hehe
I sure hope you're trolling.
man amzn is a turd burger!
Amazon is going to have a couple bumpy years until people realize that it's not a retail company and instead a cloud computing company.

Another 38% YoY revenue and profit growth for AWS, but people are just focused on the top line.
F
They post numbers ahead of call.
The only way to save them at this point. Tbh if they keep missing there won't be a reason to split 🤡
Puts back otm on this bounce, feeling good 😎
Up bigly on EV stocks. Almost broke even ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
RIP SBUX
Amzn better yolo into the split….
APPL already dropping like a rock.

Nancy Pelosi must be selling off her shares.
SPY rn: "Amazon who? Never heard of Bezos in my life, I don't know the guy."
Amazon misses eps, same way your wife misses her ex
Maybe it’s time for AMZN to spin off AWS before it goes down with the ship.
1dte? Or Nov 1st?
Listen Timmy, let me tell you a story. The reason why you don't need to interact with the poors, is because your father purchased TSLA stock many many moons ago. And then, following that, he just didn't do anything at all.
yeah always fade the initial reaction.  We'll continue to melt up tomorrow
Come on Tim Apple hurry yo ass up
FAANG is now MAANG it just dont hit the same
Amazon FCF down 90% yoy!
It's going to sell off, it always does.
AMZN misses earnings estimate, you know what that means ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)

fucking amzn going to drag us down tomorrow
Amzn won't move much it's pretty priced in prob  have a flat day imho
getting my 10th margin call tomorrow $fb $amzn
Yes.
Looks like Amazon may be coming back to earth. Expect more fake news from their Washington Post shortly
Still would have been crushed. This dip wont last
Apple always leaks something...
Don’t worry dudes, GME just announced a buyout of AMZN and AAPL
[deleted]
amazon literally collapsed. are my tsla calls fucked now?
My DD didnt get much love):
He’s hanging out somewhere
Correct, it will not be a day trade
Welcome to the club retard
50% of my portfolio was in AMZN lol ☠️☠️☠️☠️
I take donations,gifts,rewards, charity, donations
Canceling my PRIME right fucking now
your holding overnight bro…therefore its NOT a day trade

a day trade is buying and selling intraday
Made 2k from FB puts expiring tomorrow. Bought them in the last 20 minutes and dumped them 1 minute before close. [](https://i.imgur.com/9jXZacj.jpg)
4000c where you at, pants down moma wants to spank
#jassy can eat my assy
Amazon gonna announce a stock split during call and all will be forgotten.
Bezos left at the top and gave his sloppies to jassy.

Fucking bald fucker
Where’s the guy that bought AMZM 10/29 $4300c’s right before close? I want to know how it feels to gape your portfolio in one move
Calls on se meli
Wiat how are you all seeing AMZN q3 numbers?  isnt the call not for another hour+?
if you buy shares of blue chip stocks you're a pussy. let some risk in your life
They missed the estimates that were already cut by 50% from previous - a real stinker. That's why Bezos walked away, he saw it coming. Glad I went into cash today, futures down now. Will see what APPLE does.
Can Amazon get slaves so they don’t need pay people 20/hour to move boxes? If apple uses slaves why can’t Amazon
Wow I didn't think my $225 V calls for March were that stupid
Yes
Not so fast my friend..
AMZN really gonna give me that sweet volatility I've been jonesing for for weeks now?
Anybody use Max Pain Theory? Could make 2500 on a daily tomorrow selling CC's @ open
It is selling off?
Split the stock jeff needs a new rocket
Glad I didn’t all in those $3500 calls last week.
Thanks for scaring the market AMZN I was able to get out of my shitty SPY put with $1 profit before it went back up
I dropped my prime when I heard about that “shop black owned only” option, thats racist
Amazon missed EPS and Revenue, down 3% AH
Earnings that bad?
Oh ^no our Amazon, ^its bRoKEn
So here's the deal 

I need V to do a V
I loaded up on calls today
[deleted]
Bro it was the easiest trade
Was gonna buy AMZN 3250P or 3200P. Ended up not doing it because figured I’d get vol crushed.. now idk if it was right move lol
Lol AAPL already down $1 and earnings aren't for another 20 mins
Wish I had Puts on WDC 😞
Me and my AAPL puts hope so
Did they just guide 0 - 3B operating profit?! Est 6B

Damn amazon earnings. Look at that EPS just falling because of supply chain issues.
That's correct

Lollllll
Any earnings news?
Probably going to be pretty RED tomorrow.
It's an interesting move to sell all your shit right after close before the call starts. I wonder who does that.
STRONGBUCKS
Yikes. AMZN down a casual 200 pts
&gt;AMAZON Q3 21 EARNING RESULTS: Q3 EPS $6.12 (EST $8.96) || Q3 REVENUE: $110.8BLN (EST $111.811BLN) || SEES Q4 NET SALES $130.0B TO $140.0B, EST. $141.62B

Lmao Bezos rides his penis to space and AMZN falls apart. Par for the course in 2021
jef bezos do something god dammit
AMZN tank bigly.
They're doing great.

You mean, the ones you sold to others, right?
It's going to be like fucking waiting on Christmas Eve to open up my SPY, APPL, and F puts tomorrow.
Google and Teladoc were initial reactions were down too
yes sell all your amazon shares and move to meta
My IRA is looking mad heavy
I'm a charity. Let me get a happy meal after this dreadful week
Haha, well, Amazon having a sale on ropes
Heading to Seattle to kick AMZN in the balls 

BRB
HO LEE FUK
Wait Amazon controls spy?
Most people call dispatch to report a crime.  You go straight to the cop.  Baller move.
TDOC went down 6% AH and up 10% during the day. AH are fake AAAAAAAND gay don't worry
They don't exist now
Saw a commercial this afternoon for Hertz on Fox Business showing off Teslas. They knew what they were doing with that one

Is amzn gonna drag spy down tomorrow?
Noob question: I bought SPY calls at 3:55pm ET today, if I sell tmrw morning, it doesn’t count as a day trade correct?

AMZN earnings 🤢🤮
Yea you’re right. Forgot which market we’re in
How does AMZN miss eps by 30%? Wtf???
Amzn missed everything
NOO STARBCUKSSS
Where's that guy that banbet Amazon? 🤣🤣
Wow
Free Cashflow!
You have my sympathy AMZN call holders 😔
Holy fuck AMZN. Jesus have mercy.
wheres the dude with 90k in amzn calls?
Me too. Lost 300% gain
&gt;   No, I don't think so.
Swinging TSLA 1200c 10/29, we taking this bitch to value town or burning at open.
well it looks like fd puts on amazon tomorrow at open is the play
Got an AFRM Put before close 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
AMZN press release: Now into drilling operations.
Yeah, missed top and bottom
Dat Amazon miss oof
Sold my spy calls at 3:58pm.3:59pm stacked some puts for tomorrow. I’m feeling good :))
AMZN drilling and my portfolio drilling with it
Amazon misses so Apple runs, right? 

Right?!
Just got up.  how are my AMZN 4000c looking?
Chill,. Amazon just drilling to find some oil

Long live USA
Thanks Amazon for bringing the whole market down
Whoever bought my spy 462c calls at close thank you.

Thats your headache now.
Prepare to meet theta
You know I said to myself- amazon is probably going to tank 300 like they did last earnings. Then I thought, as I've heard so many times here and other places "past performance is indicative of future."

Fuck me for listening to reason.
im a perma bull but my QQQ EOD puts gonna prrrrriiiinnnt
Prog
Should have known better LCID 😩
My Amazon calls LMAOOO ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Amazon got fukt
What’s it gonna be!? 🍎 or 🍏
God thank you for making me a TP handed bitch and offloading my FB bags
AMZN DEAD
AAPL DEAD
Neidermeyer!…
Dam Amazon ain’t F* around.
Amazon missing earnings is bullish for TSLA. Tesla calls at open 🚀🚀🚀
Bezos really mad now
Yooo. Amazon drilling for hell
I bought them EOD near close for .24, so it is not like I am going to be behind Wendy's anytime soon.
$AMZN officially ded, I'm changing my mind about $BABA.
See you guys in a week

Highly doubt this dumb fucking stock drops to 975 by EOD tomorrow
Made so much money today I'm willing to donate a dollar for every like of this post spread around all the charities mentioned in the comments. Much love.
AMZN is gonna drag down the market tomorrow 🩸
Bye bye Bezos 👋👋👋
If spy isn’t red tomorrow after this I’m donating my blown out brains to the government
Averaging down my 1 AMZN share tomorrow.  Fuck.
(7) SPY 457P expiring tomorrow with a .90 avg
🤒🤒
Pretty solid day. Didn't have LCID but GOEV did right by me. That'll do pig, that'll do.
Spy isn't even budging with amzn dropping
OMG Amazon bulls holy ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
If anyone is questioning their ER play don't worry, I sold my TDOC call at open bc I thought it would be worthless
Apple doesn’t report til like 4:30
Were Amazon earnings so bad?
Damnit Amazon fuck you qqqs are dumping so hard
Bears celebrating AAPL crash!
I bought spy puts at close, I am with ya
I can’t see any way apple goes up with any earnings…so much anticipation baked in already.

And here I am holding calls like a dumbass because I forgot to check if they filled before eod
Anyone else see the absolutely dirt cheap calls on INTC about 6 months out? 

Better believe I scooped those. Windows 11+new gen processors released today =$$
goddamn virgin Jeff Bezos
RIP u/cashflow_
Amzn better announce a split
[deleted]
What did AAPL make?
AMZN crushing balls. Expected
Reading these comments idk why y’all make it so difficult literally just buy spy calls and make money easy
Lmao.  Immediate plummets before releases.  Okay traderbots.  Let us know when you are done hunting for S/Ls
amzn big miss fuck my ASS dog sHIT
Yeah but take people gambling on calls with that much IV with 1DTE…baby you got a GUh
Rich only get richer. OCGN is either gonna give me a safety net or I'm gonna still be in a tight spot. Either way, I can say I tried.
I would've made a bit of money on my spread if I'd been able to day trade, rip
If AMZN drops to 9.32 I'll be able to buy a share!
If all the Amazon call holders buy their rope from Amazon then they won't miss their eps next time
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Just bought calls cause that rat Najaran dude on CNBC. Who do I blame guys? Who?
Glad my 4000c order didn't fill, I am saved 😂😂😂
X
Qqq is more bipolar than ever
I wonder why
My call was earned about 1xxx and now just 1xx...
Bezos is renaming Amazon to AmaGONE
Awww, that makes me sad.  I miss Sears.
AWS sold $16 Billon worth in a quarter! Who in the fuck is spending that kind of cash?
Metasack
Anddddd market is dead tomorrow
[deleted]
OMG the Earnings miss ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Wait till tomorrow. This might reverse quickly. Google was down 2% AH and ended +5% the next day
Knew it.  Still went against it
AMZN damn
And thereeeeeee sheetfed goooeeees MVIS down the toilet like the turd it is
RIP
Fuck Bezos!
Jezus fuck AMZN missed
&gt;\*AMAZON 3Q NET SALES $110.8B, EST. $111.81B  
&gt;  
&gt;\*AMAZON 3Q OPER INCOME $4.9B, EST. $5.62B

Facebook don’t quit

Facebook unveils new name as company dives deep into metaverse | Fox Business https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/facebook-new-name-metaverse
Fuck me, I was browsing this sub and forgot to paper hand my 10/29 SPY calls. More worthless SPY calls for me.
Ahhhh fuck
Baldwin probably got his ass.
Oh man. AMZN really hurting

Hope it doesn’t hurt AFRM
Won my first banbet 😎 down 9k tho. Lots of mixed emotions
AAPL DED

I smelt something was foul a mile away. Thank god I sold.
[deleted]
I'm not even going to look. It would just ruin my mood for the rest of the day if the ER doesn't go my way. I'll check back tomorrow.
Amazon is back in the same mode as 10 years ago . They are going to dump all their profits into warehouses for another 5+ years and disappoint everyone . 
“ will Amazon ever make money “ is all you heard for years while bezos said fuck all of you
F for AMZN, AAPL next?
I thought Spreads meant to buy and sell an option at the same time 

But AMZN showing me it meant my butt cheeks
Guess I'm going long on these AMZN shares ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Amazon might just save my Spy puts tomorrow
Diamond handed my 11/19 lcid FDs prolly release them tomorrow
Fapping while it goes up.
It's so obvious AMZN going to miss , who didn't see that? Only reason I didn't buy puts is because IV and debit spreads is like only 2x-3x bagger which is not even worth it incase it somehow theta gangs you.
Hello officer, I'd like to report a murder
Ah AMZN gonna take AAPL with it, regardless of AAPL report. Great
Was down $1100 on Tesla with 8 min left and sold half my position at 3:58 for a $200 profit
30% eps miss is “meh” ??
Probably still gonna moon
Okay wtf is happening
So those who bought AMZN calls just because they did terrible last time so this time they will do great - show yourselves 🔫 😐😐😐
Yeah and Im strapped in for the ride now.
AMZN just announced that GME will force them into bankruptcy
RIP Bezos
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
I hope you didn’t buy calls 😅
Amazon is ded.

Now it is apple's turn to be ded.
The longer I hold these puts the more I believe I just get off being a complete retard
Goddamnit AMZN down almost 3%
AMZN 🤮
I take it AMZN is not splitting
Amazon and Apple. 🤭
Holy shit that Amazon drill
Yikes that's an awful miss
That FB P&amp;D was very meta
I hope so... got a bag I would like to unload.

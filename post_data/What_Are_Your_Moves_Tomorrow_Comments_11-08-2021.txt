People expecting TSLA to dump or pump. Based on current market rationality about equal odds of it dematerialising.
All I wanted was a 465 open, instead I got a 564 open.
Never heard of her
If you can afford it, stretch the expiration out a full month from now. Do like $350 first week of December

The contracts cost more the farther expiration right, but you get the comfort of more time to be right, but doesn't theta eat away at the contract since it's longer, idk I'm learning all this sht rn, I appreciate ur response.

Is it a good idea to short tsla at the open 9:30 for some minutes and close the position as fast as possible?

Alright MSFT, new week. I wanna see 340 out of you today. You da boss, you da boss, you da great, big, hairy boss.
Banbet ?
Elon can’t even start selling right away cause he has to file forms with the SEC. All that’s gonna happen is TSLA will dip today, then the dip will be bought, TSLA will hit new all time highs, and when he does start selling he’ll make even more profit
much

I like
Nah
Ty bb, it'll be my first option play.
Finally some good fucking news
You do realize there are calls dated a few months out right? This thing called time gives you more time to be correct. What do I know though? This is wsb afterall where anything longer than a week is considered a leap
Bub a la guts
it just has to become the world's largest company for you to make $13
Hi
Lmao some of y’all are just straight up stupid 😂😂 “trade flat” Tesla closing below 1100 today.
generally yes.
So here's the thing. I wasn't paying attention when that happened. So like 1 greedy day would be awesome 👌
Could of for sure

Are there any WSB financial advisors here that can turn 100k into a million

Everyone who's thinking about buying puts on tesla at open, what do you think happened to those same people who bought puts when Elon tweeted "the stock is too high" do ur due diligence
**Why is you staring my at me gut for ?**
TD lets you trade prior to 7. They didn't use to.

Would love to see a 2 percent spy gain in a day for once. Shit like Friday where it's. 75 up then 1 down then up .25 doesn't count.
World indexes red, America “I got this”.
So last weekend I was with this new bitch. We were riding down the coast in my lime green Lamborghini when she turned to me and asked if I have Facebook calls. Surprised, I pulled the lime green Lamborghini over and pulled out my phone and signed into Robinhood. I have two Facebook calls that I showed her and instantly her vagina started spraying cum everywhere. This bitch was pissing cum like it was urine all over the inside of my lime green Lamborghini. So I start driving again and she was begging me to take her to my 7 story mansion to fuck her inside the cockpit of my helicopter that sits on the roof of my 7 story mansion, but I dropped her back off at home bc she sprayed cumurine all over the inside of my lime green Lamborghini
I have 900 shares of Riot and 2 Coin calls. What are the odds of these printing?
TSLA only up on lowwwwww volume
They will continue to run, the only weak one is CCI who seems to not be moving much

Everything pointed to a moderate green day, in our defense. Infrastructure bill passing, good China numbers, high call buying, good momentum. Just couldn't account for Musk making a dumbass tweet on Saturday afternoon and turning the whole weekend into a press nightmare...

(I held EOM calls over the weekend. I'm down at LEAST $10k, probably closer to $25k. It's coming out of a $55k profit I had Friday afternoon, so it's not the end of the world, but I'm still upset to see it happen.)

If anyone likes stocks that have a good deal of growth left to get back to pre pandemic levels, that also are paying fat dividends at the same time… Here’s a few I really like.

Basically, while the stocks are growing substantially back to normal levels, they also pay you nice checks in the process to protect you.

PBFX - PBF Logistics pays an 8.83% dividend and has a good 80% to appreciate still with great momentum

PBA - Pembina Pipeline pays a 6.2% dividend while having a 50% runway to get to current price targets of around 48$

RWT - Redwood Trust pays a 6.25% dividend while having about a 50% gap to pre pandemic levels

CIM - Chimera pays a 8.07% dividend while having about 45% to run back to pre pandemic levels

EPR Properties - owns Top Golf and pays a 6% dividend while having a 70% runway to pre pandemic levels. 


Good luck out there ladies and gentlemen

Evgo or no?
How they been recently??
What's funnier is bot picked up current price as 1139 - the pre-market price after 7% drop.

I bet that's not the bet he wanted
Tsla was down 7% an hour ago, now only 5%. 

Stonk only goes up!
Funniest thing I can think of are put holders that can’t sell in PM as this goes slightly red by open up from -7.xx%. All your profits *poof* on weeklies. All While puts are more expensive. 

Congratulations you played yourself.

Sometimes I wonder where the money is coming from to generate these call gains.

Coin
Hold for what 🤡
LCID easy.
Pretty sure we would all
Love to double our money by the end of the week retard
Maybe at 600
If goes 75 i am gonna buy everything i see
Can’t wait for someone to test this new Pfizer drug and have it come back as 90% hydroxychloroquine
It’s premarket, let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
Man I’m disappointed by the small drop in TSLA lol.  I’m hoping at least 20% drop
&gt; You have 60k? You're poor.
I have 60k and I want them to reach 120k by the end of the week. Any decent plays?
Turns out random internet people can’t predict the future. Or anyone, for that matter. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news guy
Pelosi had calls
only 6% dawg. she can take it
Yes
Is this facts? Anyone
You have calls? may the best degenerate win
Is TSLA a buy?
pfizer say they gonna ask or get for permission to use the pill before thanksgiving. my pfizers calls for dec 3 get green and greener more.
It appears to be going down, xir
All weekend I heard Spy crashing to $460. It’s green what happen?
Keep dreaming. If it moons i buy u n your mum together at discount
Top tier retard. Wanna switch it to perma ban?Make it a real gamble 😈😈
I guess you both belong here....

$180 weeklies have a decent chance, almost free money
Chase your TSLA losses in LCID gains 50 by Friday 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
when TTD dumps at market open I will literally buy you
TSLA you bitch stop dumping. Hold you cowards
About to get a lot less crowded in here this week. NIO gang chose the ⭕️ and 🔺for easy mode while Tesla gang chose the ☂ for the sugar honeycomb squid game.
AOC has titties
WTF is going on with TOST
Yutes of the nation.
Oh look SPY ATH again, and again and again.
Goodbye my guy
#########
god speed retard
Wait till dorky Elon sell his stocks as he promised, sometime this month or the next one, then it’ll actually dip
Yesch
Go poor bitch. Live in foodstamp

Would have never expected Robinhood to say Pfizer is experiencing “elevated volatility” 😂

**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/YeahThisWasBad** bet **TSLA** goes from **1139.0** to **911.2** before **2021-11-09 04:42:03.757946-05:00**

👍

It was interesting tweet bc yeah most of us knew it was valued more than all the auto cos combined but I didn't even realize it can include those additional companies!
!banbet TSLA -20% 1d
not me, I don't have any bananas!
is this guy's flair spelled right?
When you start seeing all the desperate, "wow, great buying opportunity guiz. Buy the dip plz" messages in here, is when you know the real bloodbath is about to begin.
I bet Pfizer will be pumped even more this week and maybe next for its covid pill ‘invention’
That’s why I bought puts, so I can loose money like I should 🦍🤡
/u/A_KY_gardener \- "*Yeah. Weeklies are not a intelligent choice*"

They aren't, but once you've gotten a taste of 5,000% returns overnight, you'd empathize with us short-term options junkies.
this is bullish for TSLA actually because when FSD kills someone it won't dip that much
TSLA GO GREEN U BITCH
They’re trying to get out
ty bruv
Elon gave us a NIO coupon
Spy gonna tease 470 cause infrastructure plays and msft mitigating tsla impact?
why you telling people to buy then
Agree to both
 ru thumbshaming me m8?
Please god make TTD have the worst earnings in their history

Edit: they're up 1.83% premarket.. Me and my puts are scared
Everyone (Except Cathie) knows TSLA is overvalued but I wonder if these dips will be eaten by funds who have to keep buying it to prop the price up. And if it pulls a -10% day it will still optically look like a "buying opportunity" despite it being priced where it was a week ago
Edited! Originally copied and pasted from a Twitter post...

&gt;$TSLA: Jefferies Raises Target Price To $1400 From $950

^\*Walter ^Bloomberg ^[@DeItaone](http://twitter.com/DeItaone) ^at ^2021-11-08 ^04:38:34 ^EST-0500
TSLA is going on SALE today 

Great value great deals 

Buy pre split while you can
&gt;All these TSLA 🐻 shills making me believe in my calls even more ty 🌈

This is you 16 hours ago lmfao
That would be Amazon
Tesla has no effect on Spy. If Tesla drops to 0 spy would only drop 2%.
My TSLA puts would be up ~150% at current price. Not good enough, need this bitch to keep drilling.
&gt; You are correct. Tesla is overvalued by a factor of 10,000%.
We only compare the stock to itself and only look back 5d at best.
idk man, in my opinion it was overpriced even as 600, how is the price of tesla more than other car makets combined?

im more of a oldschool guy who likes to look at pe ratios
And then you woke up and it was down another 10%
this is a good point but I broke my thumb scrolling through it
Tesla is the most overvalued stock of all time.
We are children of the 🌽
That jump Friday and what looks like another strong Green Day today makes me want to double up. Too close to earnings to be run up momentum and seems more like conviction on earnings.
Yeah. Weeklies are not a intelligent choice
No, his pp looks like he just came
best to take the w on puts when you can.  the dip bots are vicious and can destroy you an instant, especially on something like tsla
Tesla already reacted to the Elon-Tweet in the premarket. This means the market has done its job correcting. Now its time to push the stock back to $1300 EOD.
yes im so mad I cant see the normal high quality comments people post in here
TSLA long term investors*
Si ahora por favor
$RIOT calls 🤑🤑🤑🖍🖍
Yo fuck these ban bets clogging the thread man.  Just post your position…
Tesla is going to dump so hard, then bounce, then dump even more. Knowing this I’ll still somehow lose money tomorrow

/u/maggusoeder (1/0) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1140.0 when it was 1216.7 and it did, congrats fucker.
This is what I'm expecting.
wait until the poor people can start trading lol
Check futs rn lol
Cheap where were you hiding when TSLA was at below 600 just a few months ago
RIP these puts, again.
NIO $70
tesla is 1 company out of 500... quite literally.
Wow CLF told ya steel stocks doesn’t look priced in . It’s drilling up
$NIO $70 EOM
happy to sell them to you
Lmao, I don't believe that you're actually losing it. It's just that "seethe" is such a natural reply to "Cope". Blame imageboard shitposting lol.
i bet the guy who shorted the tesla stock is so erect that it should start to hurt at this point

Sometimes we need perspective:

Scott Galloway@profgalloway

However, I don’t believe (and I don't think you do either) that Tesla is worth more than: 


Toyota / Daimler / Volkswagen / BMW / GM / Ford/ Fiat-Chrysler / Tata / Honda / Ferrari / Hyundai / Boeing / Airbus / American Air / Delta / Southwest / JetBlue

TSLA down $80  buy dip
Yea spy had a 5ish% pullback a month or two ago. That's pretty normal before it starts another bull run.
Green by op porn... Classic
Tesla is down pre-pre-pre market 

Big deal
Just everyone freaking the hell out thinking Tesla will get crushed by a tweet, murdering spy in the process etc, yet stock market DGAF..
TSLA -7.36
Why should IT Moin tho
Is anyone here not buying Tesla calls at open
[deleted]
Tesla is in a premium segment
If genius dork by the name of Elon will sell some of its stocks as he promised, it won be today for sure, probably not even this week. All this selloff is unnecessary right now, but eventually before year end there will be dip, when Musk dump his load and tweet some goofy shit as usual! 🦍🤡

Hmmmm to hold my Tesla puts or sell at open will be up 150 percent at this price 😍😍😍. I feel like it’ll drill after 5 mins of market open
No.
The fear TSLA call holders have right now in here is palpable.
how much do you take?
Number 1 stock in my ❤️
It always amazes me how many bears are here on the weekends.
!RemindMe 1 day

Let's see
cheap? compared to what?
Down 30% and the week hasn’t even started. FML
Tesla is down 6% yet spy futures is fucking green?! Lmaoo this market is more retarded than me.. selling ALL my puts at open and just buying calls. This is mental
COIN is so undervalued
Rippppp nvda puts
Gonna not set my alarm for the morning to avoid panic selling. Night guys
It's gonna be hilarious here when all the banks release new reports on TSLA tomorrow at like 8am with downgraded price targets.  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Huge buying opportunity for tesla. Why are people upset about this? This is like a dream come true. Buy up this shit when it’s cheap
MASSIVE premkt volume in TsLa rn!
Bers seem to only come out when dumbasses open they mouth.  Where were u guys the past month.  Oh yea let me guess hybernating which is where you will be going back to by eod.  Market is so gonna be lit green that any drop In Tesla will be made up by others.  All sectors will be firing on all cylinders this week and into end of the year.  Oh yea get rekt bers.

why would I be seething. the stock is getting crushed lol
Looks like I'll need more popcorn for the day.
Wtf why is everyone overreacting to Elons tweet? I have a bunch of TSLA calls that are going to be worthless due to people not being rational.
Same here.  I think this is a buying opportunity and hedge funds will likely capitalize.  I see it maybe down 3% eod and should pop back up above 1200 eow
more overbought than you can think
i have heavy leverage (x20) on sp500. does it count?
"it seems 30% of the vote was from fake TSLAQ bot accounts. poll is invalidated. not selling"

The only people getting rich today have "how to sell in the premarket" youtube tutorials
DIS calls DASH puts its that simple
Hard to tell resistance levels when the 3m chart just goes up

Might test 10% down mark at open because retard psychology is that he sells 10% and stock goes down 10% but we all know thats not how things work. It also depends on volume and whatever he tweets before open.

.
All in calls for the next month. LFG.
Man I hope spy pops a thick green dildo at open, that would be just terrific.
Post your losses TSLA holders ffs
&gt; I’m not sure how to answer that.

Incoherent nonsense.  Also anyone good who was supposed to be in it is on screen for about 5 minutes.  I usually love Villeneuve stuff but I feel pretty ripped off by this one.
&gt; I haven't taken it but I know people who have.
I think this will add to the fun and speculation and ultimately help the prices. Unless Musk is convicted of tape or their batteries blow up and start killing people, I don't think Tesla will be hurt by anything for a very long time. It's too much fun.
This week will profit taking making spy red or will infrastructure bill carry us to more green?
Anyone here take finestride? Thinking about starting but kinda nervous about side effects

I am so happy that Tesla Bulls exist. Dip buyers today will make fortunes for many long term share holders. !!!
It is 100% in full affect. Please send the pmt to me and I will forward to the government for you, kindly. Oh whats that? You have no gains, fair enough

Honestly, I should be fine, I'm just afraid it's going to open at like $28 or something
Why wouldn’t you wait until after ER? You cant possibly think pltr would move anything more than 10% at MOST to the upside after ER, then it will fall back to this 22-26 range. I don’t expect it to move much on ER but if you really think it will just buy FD’s on it today
for one reason, and one reason only.  To piss you the fuck off.

what's funny is I thought the market started pricing it in when it first was announced, then continuously for an entire month, and would sell the news in some way after it actually is signed.

Especially considering it is considerably smaller than what was first announced I think your thesis is accurate, market will have forgotten entirely and will rally again based on the news
Till june
And it’s also *possible* that I interact with a real woman today. It’s all about being realistic

Shut your fucking mouths and open the fucken casino!!!!
What strike did you sell? Just buy them back, it's been flirting with $26 so really anywhere around $27 is still fine.

You pocketed the premium too so use that towards the increased price and its not that bad. Few hundred shares shouldn't be a big deal to pick up pre-market
My farts smell so bad right now. I love it 👃💨
Printing has stopped
Exactly what I am putting my money on, panic. Also the fact that a bunch of board members have been selling a bunch of stock as of late. 

Also my exp date is in Jan. so I am not too concerned with the next few days, I am hoping elon will try to sell before new years.
You're definitely on the spectrum, Thor

I’m buying ANY, PTRA, and CLF (+ a penny stock too but i don’t want to be banned) in premarket. any i should take a look at instead of what i’m currently looking at?
They lowkey like it but talk trash about it. They refuse to fully accept it. And it's objectively an autistic shit fest for after school bullying and toxicity. You know that screech that the kids do? That's all you'll hear. Worse community than Fortnite by a landslide
Because when you’re broke and homeless, thats the only thing that will love you and not judge you.
I sold covered calls last week on my shares of PLTR and got too greedy. My shares were called away and now I have to buy them back at open 

But it's the day before earnings, so now I'm going to lose money buying back these stupid shares. I just hope it doesn't rise too quickly in pre-market (it will) 

i'm a dumb piece of shit and i deserve pain and poverty

Pretty sure the bill passing is way more important than Musk selling 10% of his TSLA shares. Market is gonna make new ATH almost every day for the rest of the year.

Ahh ok that explains it. Well bad news is if you got puts already you are under water right now because germany is buying the dip and the stocks going up. The good news is USA premarket hasn't opened yet and there are a lot of paper hand USA people who may also panic sell. See what happens.

Why so many retards here who don’t understand day lights saving time and the market opening on time?? 🤡🤡🤡
I had this set up, but wasn’t wifed up. She resented the fact I wouldn’t give her a ring because it just meant she was shacking up with me without any of the legal benefits. She gone now. Learn from my lesson people.
I don't think TSLA will go green but if it does I\`m going to laugh my ass off

Are you my mom? Why are you quoting her?
it's near the lowest it's been since Jan, so either you've been constantly buying and selling or you've been holding for a long ass time.
no way it’s a market sell. If he did the entire price would evaporate. It’s probably going to be over the course of a month or two

he wont market smash sell. but might be the sentiment change catalyst after a massive parabolic move up to make for a massive dump. which then margin calls other leverage holders and dumps it more. but we all guessing at this point.

Btw Tossla stocks was getting sold like it was going bankrupt since 10/6/21 just barely holding the ATH's.

If you buy Tesla puts as a momentum play I respect that, but if you sell short the stock you ain't black.
Completely agree. I think we already saw the low. China sales comes out in 30 mins
Ugh, as a Tesla bull, he'll find a way to piss off the next Republican administration, just for funsies. What good is money if you can't spit in every big shot politician's face?

Bruh, last week was cool, but wait until you find out what happened this week.
IDK I agree but it ran up like 20% on the FB news and I don't think it will hold up. Trim position and buy back at any lower price, or buy more at any lower price and hold core position long term.
Well im almost sure that tesla stock will drop tommorow. Going all in on PUTS sounds amazing rn

who cares, all that matters is what the stock does when pre-market opens in 1.5 hours and more importantly, where it's at when the market opens.

Let’s say, theoretically, TSLA tanks. And let’s say, theoretically, the S&amp;app doesn’t have a good day either. How would that effect banks?
Clearly take your penis out in front of the police and see if they accept your offer, pussy.

Don't forget to adjust for the squirrel hide shortage.
When he said that, the stock went down temporarily and then blasted up. It hit a new ATH just last week. People who hold shares have been making great returns. People with short dated calls, well, different story.
&gt; Opinions are for poor people.
Fuck I wish I had the balls to buy TSLA puts at close on Friday.

Figured some retard shit would happen and it would gap up 5% for no reason whatsoever
wow. this chart looks... bigly disgusting
A girl on a date told me “fuck the police”, she’s 28. Opinions?
What if elon is exercising his tesla call options and not talking about selling his common shares? That technically still equate to 10%
What? I will buy calls at open and make rich frog get

VIX futures red.

S&amp;P futures only barely red…


Hmmmm
Math checks out, never seen a stock dip and then keep dipping before
&gt; Well, they're not Teslas. They are all Model 3s that have been converted to look like Teslas with a Tesla paint job and some fake badges on the back
When tsla starts to dip, it won't un-dip till all the retards buying the dips with options are broke. it's just the tsla way
Wait, how can Hertz afford so many Teslas?

So TSLA is down 8% in Europe… if you cut out Tesla index futures are pretty much all green.
I'm doing it all wrong. The real play was to follow Cathy's footstep and open a hedge fund.
Or trim a little? It has had a long green run, it eventually will dip again. Then you have the cash to buy more again if you think it's a sound Investment.

Yes it will, it just takes a while for cost basis to show up. It took my account a couple months.
If you’re thinking of buying puts on TSLA: don’t.

Wait until it has dipped and load up on calls. It will recover and you’ll make money over the next week or two, max.

Yes sure
Who knows, seems like there’s always something. Then when you wanna sell just buy some more and hang on. Don’t care what Jim Fudd Cramer says either. All good long plays so I’ll swing and hold a few and buy the dip again
&gt; I think TTD will be about $2.00 by the end of 2020

Are you going to sell if it just keeps going up?
Gotta wait to see what happens when pre-market opens first.
It’s like a red wedding for TSLA bulls tomorrow huh
I'm a ham guy anyway so it's cool with me
&gt; No. Elon Musk sold all of his Tesla stock in 2017, and then bought it back at a lower price when the market dropped.

Don't worry, homes, love is dead now. Romance has been regulated to 200 characters and a few pics. Buy tinder gold, you cheap fucks.
Elon took a poll ... and now tomorrow I'll take a pole, up the ass with these Tesla calls and cash secured puts
I bought JETS but its just a shitty football team BOOOO
Their economics could not be any different. Literally not 1 bit. AT&amp;T is an inelastic monopoly, where lowering the price lowers total revenue and Intel is literally the EXACT opposite.
He keep bluffing like retard. Remember these assholes said tesla never going 900. Tesla never going 1000, tesla never going 1100 now tesla never going 1500 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I came here just to see all the put plays on Tesla. I was not wrong, however, I am surprised to see bulls… though I really shouldn’t be.

Now, I think Tesla will plummet, therefor it will do the opposite. But with that bullishness in my mind it will inverse my inverse and plummet.
🔥🔥🔥
Conviction &gt; Diversification
Go Ford 

We got this Elon retard situation

How does it not make sense? It’s at a p/e of 400. You’re trolling
As long as interest rates don't go up, TSLA will just keep going up. Once it does, that changes everything.... TSLA will... go up even faster. 

TSLA to $10 trillion market cap, let's go!
ah like a true retard ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Thats what he makes you delusional ber to think and short tesla. So that we get free money forever. Longs never have lost will not for any near future
This makes no sense. Next.
If you're extremely new to options, I would "paper trade" until you get the hang of it. Maybe stick with stocks for now.

Yes, options can be very rewarding if played well, but I would really stick to something like stocks if you are super new.

This is just risk management, in general. Stocks can be held forever (technically). Options can expire worthless.
Options ?

Tesla isn’t going to stay up this high. 1200 is pricing in half of the decade.

TSLA bears —you’ve been losing, always. What makes you think this time is different?
You know I can’t read
So why on Saturday the 6th, did Elon tweet his Twit?… there has to be some kind of subliminal message…

11/6? Maybe an 11/6 split incoming perhaps?

11/2021? Maybe in 11 days TSLA will be up to $2021?

I need answers. Quick, you wrinkle brains, get your hands off your cocks, snort a quick line, pull out your abacus’ and figure the coded meaning out.

What's dumb is that Tesla tanking has nothing to do with the industry lol so I guess a good opportunity to buy Plug here
You're thinking too much. Clicking disagreed would've meant you were a practical problem solver for the company.

Oh okay.
There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp, and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no-one to escape. But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis, my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing.

I hear it's going to be tough to get turkey due to low supply so best to buy frozen ones now. Or maybe the news lied to me, not sure.

Cybertruck will come when your son is trading tesla
I've taken some before but this was pretty different. They'd have statements like "most of the time, I am average at intuition" and then you click agree or disagree. But clicking disagree could mean I think I'm either below or above average. Doesn't make any sense

I think ankle socks is their currency. Might have switched to tube socks recently though, I’m out of practice.
Tesla tanking also means Plug will likely tank so my calls are fucked

The key ingredient to fertilizers. Food prices will have to go up more than they already have.
If TQQQ doesn't go up tomorrow I'll literally do nothing about it. I might sell for a loss but that's it
My Tesla Dec19 1200 put credit spread it keeping me up. Might just sell it at $600 profit. They can keep the $4400.
Green before open
SOFI baby!
Things like Tesla and Spy can go either way, no matter how sure you are of a direction. 

I’m skipping Spy for now, and going with Live Nation puts after what just happened
If $NIO opens and stays green tomorrow, we're in for a ride through earnings. Deutsch upgrade to $70 wtf is this doing at $40, everyone scared of the china man?!

 Bears fucked so bad. Im sorry
Okay, I know I said my good nights but I have to vent. Just as we were getting ready to go to bed the fucking puppy shits… under the fucking bed 🤬!

That’s not the part that has me heated tho

I lift up the bed so that my gf can clean the shit up and I say “use the flashlight on your phone so that you can make sure to get it all.” And she rolls her eyes at me. Meanwhile she’s taking her sweat ass time to actually get cleaning. She uses the cleaner and is finishing it off with some vinegar/water and I ask “did you get it all?” And she said “I think so” and I ask “did you use a flashlight?” And she says “no”……………. so I’m holding the bed up with one arm and I pull out my phone with the other and I turn on the flashlight and there are two small turd smears!! One of them i specifically pointed out to her in the beginning! I say “this is why I said use your phone light” and she dead ass says…………. “How was I supposed to see those!?” 

I’m so fucking heated right now. I felt like throwing this damn bed and dog out the window.
Yeah but it's Colombia.  Goddamn third world and shit.
Even better, then you can legally take time off work for a medical condition… not seeing how you couldn’t come out a winner here 😁

I sometimes think of the first girl who gave me attention for like 3 months on snapchat but never liked me. Fuck that hoe. Stupid cunt. I was so young and fell in "love"..or maybe it was lust. I didn't know her well enough and still think about her. Literally our main form of communication was snapchat. In real life I spent maybe a total of 1 hour around her vicinity.  The brain is so retarted. My brain, meaning I'm retarted or something. Whatever, I was young like 18. Still scarred

I love the market, be it the US or anywhere else. But real shit spy 500 is pricing in 2022 and we are kicking a recession can down the curb, merely delaying and worsening the inevitable. People chasing bubbles are about to see their portfolio get *thanos snapped* you know you hate to see it.
In PLTR's case, the moon is actually $4/sh below whatever their current share price is.

Saying the exact right thing.
Futures immediately filled the gap at open and have been making continued progress upwards. If spy isn't green at open, it turns green quickly and ends that way
You just use🌈 for it so they take no offense
It won't be, but I'm very excited to see how hilariously bad it will be.
This is true retard logic at work.

Lol CNBC and anyone else who claims that China, India, or any other broke country is emitting too much carbon can shove it.

The one that makes money while owning Tesla is stupid.., and the one that hates the valuation while screaming at the sky while either losing money or on the sidelines is the smart one. Got it.
Crushing earnings doesn’t warrant an increase of 700 billion in market cap.  The company is great but the stock is coming back down to earth soon.

SPY has the most liquid options with the tightest spreads there is simply no other ETF or Stock that has such robust options market. You always know that you can buy 100 contracts and guaranteed unload them even if they tank or go deep in the money.

You won't believe how easily you can get stuck without buyers playing illiquid options.

Elon you can't exchange your money to be young, hip, and to belong to the future. Just stop with the "memes" and give people reasons to buy your products instead of someone else's.
People saying Elons tweet isn't a big deal, it is. It's the price it's at currently that will make it tnak. 1.25 Trillion market cap. The stock was in the 500s a few months ago. Literally nothing has changed since then. If the stock was $700 - $800 there wouldn't be that much a move downwards.
Over a year since it’s been $500 range

High volume and predictable movement. It rarely goes more then 2% in either direction and mostly goes up. Getting weekly calls like $4 OTM just keeps working.

Everyone on here is getting overly bearish and it’s simply FUD. I’m not a TSLA bull, but obviously he wouldn’t sell all 25B worth in a single market order or some shit. And yeah he’d have to work it out with the SEC. they might even fine him for this whole TWTR ordeal.
Bears forget about the 2nd part of the equation. After a dip there's a rip

If you, Redditor, would like to clap Adolf Hitler's perfectly round, tight cheeks. Make him beg to invade his chocolate Poland. Feel his entire body shiver and quake as you force a blitzkrieg inside of his delicious gas chamber, slowly wafting the sweet aromas that exit from him as you please him. As you kiss his lips, feeling that iconic stache rub against your face, you thrust deeper and deeper into his motherlands, savoring every second you have with your Fuhrer. When you finish, you leave behind a river of cum flowing elegantly out of his rear, and when Hitler goes on his back, raises his lower body upwards so that his perfect ass is above his head so that he may drink from the cum fountain exiting him, you kiss his forehead, scratch his head, and cuddle him. You didn't find an one night stand that fateful day. You've found love.

some of you all are the type to fake a text message exchange with your boss for karma and it shows
I liked it all
Astroworld? More like I asked your girl if I could help her choose an outfit for homecoming this weekend. She said she’s just gonna wear something “slutty” (whatever that means). Yuck. I wish she respected herself more and didn’t go for douchebag jerks. I’ve known her since kindergarten and I always felt like we “clicked”. Unfortunately, due to my slim stature, she doesn’t understand the chemistry we have. I will win her trust eventually, and show her that real men still exist in this backwards “swag” culture we live in

All this TSLA dipping bullshit is just FUD. Elon is a paid shill and is probably short the stock
I’m genuinely curious how this will pan out
He is 15 years old kid with 300 billion dollars and 63 million followers thats what it is
Idk who Tf hengguang li is but he just upgraded TSLA stock from hold to buy and a price target of 1380. Northeast securities
vice president, dude...
He helms a company worth the infrastructure bill and is an absolute chad so, yes
A 20 billion dollar dip + others selling is an easy entry position, basically recreating the last two weeks all over again

Humans are forced to leave after they accidentally kill one of the Na’vi people who live there.

Please answer, ban me for a week if that’s what it takes
Okay, okay, last post. I went to a wendies to get my dick sucked behind the dumpster? Where the fuck were you guys? Or, is this a lie that you joke about?
I’m drooling at the thought of TSLA puts, but eh, it’s probably priced in.
Where is this week earnings picture?
True.
Dune was horrible. Basically the same plot as Avartar but it’s gonna be stretched across several movies and isn’t even as visually fun to watch. Flat ass characters and stupid concepts behind the world the movie is placed in. Big fat fart noise of a movie.
gave up months ago after phase 3 results. imagine holding and waiting around for buyout when the rest of the stock markets rally
&gt; I’m not sure.
Probably open a bit red (maybe down $3)  then shoot back up to ATH for SPY cause why the fuck not, nobody is stopping this Santa Claus rally
I’m not playing tsla but does anyone else thinking shorting it is too obvious a move? Bear trap?
GREAT WHITE wins
Going to sleep soundly knowing that bears will still be poor tomorrow

First you say you made 2mill off TSLA calls..now you say you have over 100k in your account??? Which one is it??

VPN companies want me to buy their shit to hide my activity from hackers

Been there done that. Solid advice

Travis Scott killed his fans and Elon Musk is retiring, I think?

The slaves aren’t returning to their shit jobs. 

The problem is that the shit pay, lack of any benefits is priced into the product. Companies are in a tough spot. Adding a dollar or two won’t do it. The BBB bill offers zero solutions to the problem.
Fuck😂 thats so smart
I do
Know your memes, kid
Today was extremely autistic I think we can all agree on that whether bullish or bearish on shit. The entire world went full regard because we went full autismo about Elon. And I guess now he has gone from Baron Muskrat to Edgelord of edgeville. Best metaverse timeline

You fucked up. You're supposed to get them to scream near someone else's window and they get them after. Then you have yourself a couple of lackeys.
Where would you sleep?

Massage my balls with SPY calls.
Okay so I was complaining earlier about the neighbors annoying kids that yell and scream outside my window all the time doing fuckshit. Well i saw them playing nerf, 2 boys, and So I went down there and gave them 2 of my cool classic nerf guns and said that I was only going to give them it if they promised to not scream so much near my window. Seems to have worked well haha, probably not for long but hey I tried.

I feel like CLNE is legit gonna be big in a while, but I think you'll have to go 2024 to really cash out on it. I mean it'll probably pop up later in '22 but not to what I think the company will be worth when they become profitable.
Tesla Puts hitting hard tomorrow 

PTON hard
I don't get how some of these software/app based companies get so big with such awful software and customer service

I saw what looked like chocolate on my bed... it was dirt. Found out after I ate it.
SSD - Simpson Manufacturing - has a monopoly on a type of steel connector that is used in all wood-framed buildings, and in many concrete applications.  It owns 75% of that market and has a great reputation in the industry.  It has pricing control.  It is also based in the Bay Area, and is a remarkably savvy company, doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work to get their connectors specc'd into architects' plans.

That is safer than raw-dogging it into steel manufacturing imo.

My entire port is $2500. I need it to be $11,000 in a year. What’s the move?
God I hope so, I’d make a few hundred grand on my calls.  Although my realism hope for like 475ish EoW and 490ish EoM

Futures barely red, bears spewing their propaganda, more shrek dildos in the morning, yawn
US Steel ($X).  Ridiculously low P/E (2.6), high percentage short float (22.5%), infrastructure bill just signed necessitating purchase of steel for highways, buildings and broadband.  Little international competition - China still has tariffs and is restricting production in preparation for Winter Olympics (reduction of air pollution from coal - fired ovens).  Overseas transport is limited by fuel, labor, and container fees (~ 17 - 20k / container).  Prices continue to rise for steel along with profits.  Good luck to all US Steel shareholders.
Exactly why you must be smelling nice. Think they will let a normal homeless person in there? Not at all.
If we are red this week, it is officially confirmed Papa Elon rules the market.
No
The event this weekend, can be used as a control method . Watch out . Seems like this chapter isnt finished and there are more pages to be wrote . Very bullish still

Yeah, he's only 35.

Edit: joking. He's 7.
Because its quite obvious
Basically what everyone I know is doing. Shedding shares for profit. Maybe not be all but a lot

When I was in 9th grade Econ back in 2006, we had a project where we had $100,000 to “invest” using an Excel spreadsheet. 

I YOLOed into CMG, with no DD apart from “Burritos are tasty.”

Little did I know, they had just IPOed that year, so it was not uncommon to see 5% “gains” in a day. So, I kept “buying” more shares. 

The irony is that had that investment been real, I’d be rich by now lmao.
Lol. Bill passing helps DIA and IWM. They need to catch up while tech and spy chill for a bit
Ban if you don’t post position
Is that how you spell it?
The market has been on “fuck puts” mode for so long. What makes you think tomorrow will be different? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)

Pton puts? Too late? Will it go to 45?
You belong to tha streets
Unbelievable how people are still buying DWAC and anticipating it to hit $1000 on DWAC_Stock
About 4x, assuming a +20% IV spike. Most shorts jumping in at open will get crushed by the impending dip buying surge though
Might have to return it
SNAP pleas fly 🚀🚀🚀
Lol blatent. I'm happy this is going on now. My shares are gonna be fine, but it's nice to see some high profile degenerates sweat.

I was thinking of buying an FD TSLA 900p just for shits and giggles on Friday too but decided against it, wonder how much it's gonna be on open.
If you think tesla is tanking spy your insane lol. Tesla is only 2% in the spy etf index.

Puts and calls are theta gang traps. If you don’t know what you’re doing just sell and wait to rebuy
I don’t know guys. I’m doing a cash out refinance and getting at 2.25% rate. It sure doesn’t seem to me like the market is gonna take a shit. But I’d sure love for it to take that shit, because the cash out is to invest in SPY.
Lead paint, my favorite!

If TSLA is green tomorrow I will literally jump off my roof and the mods have to enforce it
Tesla is 2.5% of SPY and 4.5% of QQQ but point taken
Iwm, RIOT, CHPT, CLF, PLUG, FCEL
ZI 11/19 80c 
RIOT 11/19 35c
When is the bottom of the dip, tomorrow? 😂
it’s November and it’s like 55 degrees like it’s spring. Shit the ice really is melting
Tomorrow might not suck for TSLA, what if it opens +4-5%.. we just don't know with this crazy ticker.
The top 5 are worth about $907B. The deficit is $2.77T. So all their money combined could fund our federal deficit for 4 months
Your mum

How are you guys feeling about ZM puts?

PS. Not a 🌈 🐻 but I love 💰
OPEN calls
🤡🤡jokers will say everything
FB? What’s that
I think we have a nasty open due to expectations of worse inflation and job data

PPI on Tuesday, CPI and job data on Wednesday. I might finally turn in my rainbow and buy a call if PPI turns out to be a good surprise.
Yeah, I just checked, my profits are up about 10% right now with the money flying around
SPY CALLS BABY
Yeah long term trend means jack shit on a weekly call
It will be late if you buy at open
Has to sell before December to have them on this year's taxes.
&gt; Yep.
Easier to view your gappy spaced front teeth
:(
People still trying to use it as a hedge?
So Tesla Puts at open tomorrow?
Always love hearing "When in doubt, just zoom out" said by people who probably bought calls at the top
Looks extended possibly pull back but close green EOD 
I feel like we can hit 500 by Dec
You do understand everyone else gonna sell to beat him to it.
Hopefully FB moons this week or else ramen for me
All you TSLA bears are like horny little boys seeing their first tittie. 

Just like when you went home and snapped your little carrot… **it ain’t lasting long**

Calls for me on the dip.

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
TSLA makes up a much larger portion of QQQ than SPY, and SPY has "safe" stuff that does well when high-growth tech like TSLA crashes (and takes high-growth, unprofitable tech with it)
Bravo 👏🏻 I concede

I learned this lesson the hard way with Pfizer last year and then with Pton after their earnings in 2020. Now anytime big news hits I know I’m too late to the markets reaction
Worked if you were into Porches last 10 years. I don't know about the 80's muscle car plan though, it's not like the are good cars at all, and they build a shit tonne of them. Only the absolute best examples will be sought after and appreciate.

Weeklies/monthlies around earnings seems to have the highest value for risk/reward on those names.

I typically don't sell puts more than 2-3 weeks out unless it's a name I really like.

No reason to tie up capital that long and possibly get caught in a long selloff.
GL TSLA bulls

Papa Elon will come thru at some pt he always does

ummm might be a bumpry ride tho gl
Nah but TSLA comin way back
Funny how my undergrad school is named Elon Univ... Just realized they are probably crushing the clicks right now.
Eat my shorts.
my puts will pay tomorrow, and sure after the market corrects a solid 10-15%, the march up will continue, or the march to flat will continue
Everyone in here googling “how to short Tesla”. This is going to end spectacularly
TSLA may hit $1400 EOW....

Whoa there grandpa, take it easy.
Buy as early as you can and sell at the first sign of the buying slowing down. When volume dips, so do you

From billions to dollars, the wsb story.
You call me infantile, that's a real big word. You must feel real smart, you a real big nerd. I bet you could digest Sesame Street by age 30 so let me break this down like the real Big Bird. 

A makes the ah sound, like in appendage. Rats have hands like I initially mentioned. That makes them kinda like us obviously, which you must be retarded if you never could see.

B makes the buh sound, like in brain. Rats can adapt to environmental strain. So they might survive if humans go extinct, and bring the existence of science back from the brink.

C makes the cuh sound, like cooperation. Rats don't do this and so they'll never form nations. That means they won't succumb to nationalism, fighting over flags or throwing each other in prisons.

D makes the duh sound, like duh. You sound dumb as fuck right now for real bruh. Rats are small and light enough to colonize space, you need to stop being butthurt they're the superior race.
He’s not dumping tomorrow and there’s lots of catalysts coming up so yeah, be surprised if we don’t hit ATH by EOW

&gt; I’m not on the street, I work in finance
Why doesn't Elon just use all his proceeds from selling shares to make a generous donation to Autism Speaks? He can avoid giving any of it to the feds while simultaneously supporting his fellow like minded thinkers.

He did it to coin markets a few months ago.  Still hasn’t fully recovered
[Jeffries upgrades TSLA PT to street high $1400](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1457533524030881799?s=21)
He just trying to avoid those taxes on unrealized gains
He can only sell his shares at certain times.
My ban bet still stands. TSLA $999 by eod tomorrow. God speed retards 🤯
Naw I already have a list like that which I sell puts off of... the meme plays are nice because they have fat premiums on those low strike options.

Means you can get a nice 5-10% return on moderate to low risk.
Fuk off trash fuk
Who’s going hard on LYV puts at open?
That chick better be like 5’0” in this day and age of hormone meats
Elon Musk is putting more shares in circulation from his pocket. Demand will still be higher than supply, but volume will be greater

Why are people talking about puts?!
Selling the news means selling the sell off. That’s a double negative you dumb dumbs

EOW 1500C

!banbet TSLA 1500 11/12 or the next commenter will eat a pizza delivered by Elon Musk
I'd be happy with a dip at open to 466 and then a run up to 469.5 by close, Tuesday run up to 474. I'm not greedy.
Ok retard
So chargepoint go 🚀🚀🚀
There’s been billions in Tesla calls bought these last few weeks. You really think the retards here are driving that bus?! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Y not
Good luck!  I got some long dated calls.
Bad choice
He isnt

But u all paying for hiis
No
Been watching Dave Paperhand Portnoy's pornos?
Stocks like LYV and DDS as the "great reopening" plays at prices 2x - 3x ATHs will be the same as PTON and ZM as "corona plays" will all collapse in 2022
Well of course I’d drive it, but it would be a weekend car. I’d maybe put 100-200 miles on it per month
So he doesn’t have to pay crazy amount next year if the demmies pass legislation
People planning to buy Tesla dip tomorrow. Do you really think it will only fall for one day after founder dumps 10% of the company????
[deleted]
AMZN's founder just tweeted he was selling 10% of his stock in the company. Why is someone so unstable in charge?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
The IV on tsla puts going to be insane tomorrow, you could still theoretically make $$ if timed right, but calls will take a massive shit and be on sale, in which you could make a killing on the rebound.
not my worlds but down to 4350 is what some are saying
Bought a 60 000 miles Mazdaspeed MX-5 4 weeks ago, the rarest of them all. Depreciating it by about 200 miles a week, this "investment" is doing awesomely.
Gonna laugh so hard if TSLA announces a split this week. Get rickity recked shorts 🩳

It’s well timed release of information like that justice dept article just after massive short positions appear.

They also have some kind of drone tech.  They have a subreddit with people on there that know a lot more than me.  I’ve just been reading from there.
Best advice really ^
I like this idea but I can’t help but drive the cars I buy. So I’m not good at keeping the value
I doubted the Titans defense. They look legit tonight
ah yes. 

the before time age. I was such a young lad back then I hardly remember.

but the Tsla, BB, and gourds do sound familiar..
I’d laugh if TSLA filed a Form 4 tomorrow
This fad seems like it’s been going on better part of a decade now. Fit people where overachievers when I was in highschool.
Yes he trash mofo
My dad did this but with an early 90s bronco. It will definitely only go up in value. It’s a great looking truck and has the OJ running from cops in a bronco story to go along with it.
Harvard can believe it.
I like how heavy they went into the whole nazi thing…Do they not know what subtly and nuance are? did they really think people didn’t get the connection from the original movies? They literally thought they had to go full charli chaplain, The Great Dictator for people to get it??
No this is what you think, but the infrastructure bump charging has gotten has been priced in for a long time. 

As an example, Chargepoint already has an $8 billion market cap lol. 

$7.5 billion spread across 12 competitors as well as the gas stations and other infrastructure needed to house them.  

Oh yeah and TSLA opening up its charging network, LCID is building its own, and so are likely all the other automakers. 

You want to buy the already overpriced charging companies for a quick pump and dump, good luck getting out in time.
Time to buy calls on a random ticker again I saw on WSB with the only DD being 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. Let’s go boyos

Your financial freedom is in your own hands. Vote yes, buy the dip, and turn your $500 into $565.
It is a fitness fad, you decide
They cut the ligament that's inside but then it's all floppy.
The Travis Scott concert was a new low.  Our society is warped idolizing celebrities and money above all else.  We’d be better off if we focused on being good to others, caring for our health, and participating in our communities

Agree too much circle jerk here on tsla. going to end in a bloodbath imo.
Honestly, I would rather be Pete Davidson than Elon. Pete is far richer in life.
Can't wait. Playing options has also changed my life forever but in a much less meaningful way

I’m thinking about diversifying my portfolio by buying an 80’s muscle car. Something like a foxbody mustang or a camaro iroc z. Ideally something in good condition with a new/newer engine. If I can keep it in good condition and not put too many miles on it, I don’t see the car going down in value. There are only so many left in the world, and one by one they are being crashed or broken down. The supply keeps shrinking. If inflation continues, the price of the car will go up with inflation. 

What are your thoughts on this?
Dude. Tesla has semis.
Things have really gotten regarded in this metaverse, maybe just maybe we can go to a new metaverse soon thats even MORE regarded. Hope springs eternal in the human breast..Autist never is, but always to be blest.
stonks only go up why puts unless it's real bad?
I'm a solid 2-3 poops a day person. I can't even gather how someone could hold that stink in them.

Good evening girls and boys. I think my late friday buy of spy puts, qqq puts and a single IWM put should pay off tomorrow. I told y'all that the markets gap low on a defenseless monday in october usually, but that october surprise was going to be in november this year. I bought my weekend insurance. Some ppl i follow on twitter who i think are good, think this could be down 400 on the SPY tomorrow. I also have COTY calls so there's that
So does CLF have the capacity to pop
This is the kind of humour I come here for
Ok I get your point but let’s say it tanks Monday you buying calls that day seems risky

How do you judge how far out to make them? Or do you just roll weeklies?
If live nation tanks tomorrow from cuz of the astroworld tragedy I’m immediately buying calls. This will be just like when United dropped cuz they beat the shit out of that doctor and dragged him off the flight. Means nothing when the news moves onto something else in a couple weeks
Add NKLA. Fell a bit but the worst of them all

Playing the halts eh?  Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose either way you're in total panic for at least 10 minutes.
He actually your pimp and hooked you in grinder now go put your dick to maximize the profit
My professional opinion: not meme-y enough. Max short term profit: 10-20%
Did you really?
I’m legit gonna sell most of my positions and go hard on this play.
For a lot of meme stocks, I pretty much just sell OTM or slightly ITM puts; safest way to play them.

Upside is limited of course, but your downside is ending up purchasing the stock at a much lower price; often below the current all time lows.

Given the trajectory of some of these plays like CLOV, SDC, ROOT and whatever else that are bouncing along bottoms, it just feels like the best way to play them.
Dune was solid.
Coda
I better see some good fucking tsla loss porn tomorrow for the people that didn't sell their tsla shit after posting their gains.

Need to be 18+ on Spotify to listen to it.

Poop every morning as soon as I wake up. It’s a joy in life

Goodnight!
You believe the numbers coming out of China? Perhaps that's also the issue.

Additionally, XPENG is a major direct competitor for NIO. TSLA despite the issues is still the leader. Being #3 is a big deal in such a huge market.. however, again skeptical on the numbers that are being reported.

Please don't confuse my skepticism of the accuracy of numbers to being racist.
Fuck y’all whoever downvoted me you whore bots
&gt; I am not implying anything. I think it is pretty clear that he has done something wrong.
They got their foot in the door. It not about the rich its about the little guy.
Waiting for a dip? There’s been plenty of dips. In fact just last march no one wanted the stock it dipped 500 territory after everyone hopped on the $900  range from the value the company achieved from its stock split. I bought that dip made 60%+
Looking forward to people finding out about negative gamma 😈😈
By using the word defending, you are implying that he did something wrong. Like what?
WHERE ARE BEAR LOSS PORNS😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
🍎
Get in a good routine and the poop will follow. Eat right. Bed at the same time.
Is TSLA really delisted? My puts are showing max profit and I got an email from my broker.
Four words: buy the dip
And they just keep getting worse. No build up, poor story. Just right into action, zero closure. Like a bad date.
He has something up his sleeve but idk what it is.

NDX futures fucking dumping lol 😍
The plan tomorrow is to make enough money to have my hair grow back as thick as Elon's.
By what metric are they “good”. I’m sorry, but I don’t believe you and, in fact, I strong disagree with you. Your arguments are baseless and infantile.

TESLA is mooning and I don’t just mean it’s going up. It’s gonna be the first stock to trade on the LSX (lunar stock exchange) on the actual moon.
Puts on people dumb enough to go to huge events like that.
Yeah prolly best rn ngl
That's there only reason the market is possible.
puts on society if he gets more famous and successful for this BS.
And if you are a stockholder of the one who will work to reverse the condition, you will make a fortune. I never said there were no risk.
my gains are always unrealized
Good thing I lost my money last week
Puts on Lil Dicky too before he pulls some even worse shit
Where's a spot for up to date vix? Didn't think it was open yet till 4am
Who knows dude I’m not trying to spread FUD on it, looking for differing views.

Yeah the money for supercharger technology should be a big boost to the EV industry.

I feel this one down to my core

Affirm is gonna tank huh, should I sell my shares?
False

You should be able to write off unrealised losses too, thats fair

It can do better than that. I want a real Black Friday sale.
Musk was gonna sell off some anyways. Early week dump, then resume pump. Calls on the dip. Strangle on the movement

Worse, NBC
Lmao I’m old enough to remember last week on Monday night when every TSLA bear was jumping for joy for the upcoming catastrophic crash that never happened. They got fukt by theta and the stock closed higher on Friday than it did Monday.
I don’t think of it at all (the fuck is freshpet?)
am i retarded or should that be long term capital gains tax and not short term? the shares are from 2012. that means he only has to pay 5.6 billion to the irs right?
Lameooo
Yes they don't know what they are talking about. SAVA is a life changing opportunity. Both for stock holders and society.
Depends what you got in at
Tesla bearishness and infrastructure plan bullishness will collide tomorrow, once again leading to theta gang taking our money.
US has spent $80 billion on SNAP last year……. Yet $4 billion can solve WORLD hunger……… 

I’m so glad Elon called out that BS grandstanding.
Unless you ran with beagle on your dick in sewage
Passing a tax on unrealized gains would effectively kill private equity and venture capital funds. It would completely end capital raising for start ups. No one would ever tie up their money for 6-10 years and pay rediculous taxes during that time based on a valuation estimate done once a year with no guarantee that a company ever actually goes public.
Tesla just needs to drop 82% to get in at the price at sold it at last year
As if that magically stops the market lmfao
Well with elon musk being elon, it looks like the taser for u.

How does one become happy in life even when they are successful?

Wow. There’s a lot of truth here

How would they know
Like so many others before it. Aduhelm, anyone?

r/REBubble
&gt; Tesla is being delisted from the Nasdaq. It will trade on an exchange called OTCQX, which trades over-the-counter stocks that are not listed on a major U.S. stock market such as the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market
“No matter the results of the poll, Musk would have likely started selling millions of shares this quarter. The reason: a looming tax bill of more than $15 billion.

Musk was awarded options in 2012 as part of a compensation plan. Because he doesn’t take a salary or cash bonus, his wealth comes from stock awards and the gains in Tesla’s share price. The 2012 award was for 22.8 million shares at a strike price of $6.24 per share. Tesla shares closed at $1,222.09 on Friday, meaning his gain on the shares totals just under $28 billion.

The company has also recently disclosed that Musk has taken out loans using his shares as collateral, and with the sales, Musk may want to repay some of those loan obligations.”

Tl;dr: Elon is just being an attention whore like always. 

Still glad I did my democratic duty by voting though.
Guys my broker just sent a notice that TSLA is being delisted tomorrow. Any idea what happens to my options?

If TSLA tanks, I'm averaging down in the dip.
I hope you aren’t running for any public positions on this platform
Maybe I'm overly cocky, but a few of us here are the best investors in the world. 

1. We're younger. Warren Buffet is 91 years old. Charlie Munger is 97. Jack Bogle is dead. We're like those ultra-young Supreme Court Justices that get to rule for decades. Isaac Newton was a genius, but he never heard of the internet, so we have more knowledge than him. Also he blew up his account the same way as people here, so we're in good company.
2. We're big. Reddit is one of the most popular websites on the internet. This is the biggest draw for finance types. There's billionaires shitposting here anonymously.
3. We get the weirdness of the market like no one else. The richest human alive told the head of the US Senate Finance Committee to suck it. No old school analyst gets it like us.

Circumcision is like 500. TSLA not gonna be worth that by open.
Our tax policy is backwards - right now we tax rich people more than others - we really should raise taxes on low and no income earners and lower taxes on rich people, this way they have an incentive to earn more money and not be poor

That’s what I think too. It’s all EV HYPE from here on out.  In the retail sector any EV stock that they can buy for less than 50 bucks is viewed as a “deal” due to Tesla’s ungodly evaluation.

Dead. I bought at 23 something and sold over 100. Trump and Dump
I’ve done a good job making money off retail sentiments, I’m not saying it’s undervalued, but out on the market people are going to want to find the next tesla.  That should push it higher in the short term, plus the EV credits in the infrastructure bill.
I have a knife, willing to do free circumcisions. I take payment in testing my product.
Ahh ok gotcha. You already got ur leaps now ur looking for excitement. I should tell u my life goal right now is 100% because of u. To get to 35k then put it into a spy leap. So thank you

Elon has banged at least 3 bitches in his life. What a chad
Idk exactly too lazy to look, but alot.
I’m saying that the retail market is going to think it’s “the next tesla!” And it’ll be perceived as undervalued.  It’s a company just get started and looks to be doing everything right.   Lots of positive coverage.  The Rivian IPO is going to be dicey, but at least for now LCID seems like a good buy.
Throw another $5K into CGC YOU GOT IT 😭

It’s so retarded that Musk has to pay over 50% taxes on his stock gains. I wish he was petty enough to send truck loads of pennys, nickels, dimes, quarters, and dollars bills of money to the IRS.

that's where you are wrong my friend. It's a microcosm of the world. There are plenty of conservative folks with huge followings so the 'right' is out there, fact of the matter is that leftist ideology if more popular than conservative thought, that's why it feels like it's mostly left voices. It's just the prevalent opinion of the masses speaking
Mostly I’m chasing the dragon on shitposting as Sunday draws to a close.

If they start taxing unrealized gains they better raise the damn capital losses limit above $3,000. That was passed in the 1960's so inflation adjusted its about $25,000 per year. Just another example of how the government loves to skull fuck the little guy.

Affrm got walmart, amazon and shopify.

From Net upstart what I observed is, these fintechs have large backup from investing firms like insurance and banking.

Large investment will flow on any good news from affrm, i am sure there are going to be couple of good things affrm going to put it down and their plans to establish with amazon, walmart and shopify which will project big for now

A nice bildungsroman
I am going to be focused on TSLA this month but if anyone is looking for a play that no one is talking about I would go with $FTCH

It will run hard into the new year after a blowout earnings on luxury/designer goods; buy yourself some nice Gucci loafers with your gains!

Before y’all run to buy TSLA puts tomorrow, just remember that Elon tweeted, “Tesla stock price is too high IMO,” when it was at like $80 pre split. It then dumped 3% in like 5 minutes, and then rocketed to 2000 PRE SPLIT in about 8 months time. I’m still buying puts though.
Nah, you can’t afford to eat out.

Yes, I understand your thesis. I am saying it is a poor one that will undoubtedly result in massive losses over a large sample.

I have 2023 calls, if it dips back down to $150 I’m going 2024 😡
Is it a bad idea to fuck a coworker that you only see once every few months when you travel together?
I been buying calls for 2023 since it was $130 so far so good. My price target for end of 2022 is $185
Except NIO has very little downside. Sure it might have a red day but there’s limits. It’s not breaking 35, won’t even break 38-39 probably.

This guy knows what’s up
Don’t tell Tren, he’ll come lick every dollar
So tomorrow I will be bird dogging TSLA in the first 5 minutes.  If it goes under 1100 in the first 5, I'll be primed to open some 1200c when it hits 1050, and double down if it goes under 1000.  If it is over 1100 at 9:35, I'm not going to give it another look this week.

I'm going to be looking at EVGO, CHPT and F calls to see whether they caught a stimulus bump.  If they do - more than a dollar in F's case, a couple bucks for EVGO and CHPT - I'll be selling those Dec and Jan calls I've been holding.  Otherwise I'll let 'em ride a week or two while the big money catches up to the smart money.

I think these SHCR 7.5s 11/19 will print through earnings, but if they run up enough I won't wait for the IV crush.  I'd take a double on those.

The Dec UVXY calls are like a fine cheese - they take some time to mature and they will smell bad the whole time.

These XOS calls?  I wish I'd been smoking crack when I bought them - at least I'd have an excuse.  And a crack high.

It doesn’t matter what happens tomorrow. The idea that you could make a decision to buy calls on a daytrade basis on something that is only showing downward if not sideways tendency right now is just ridiculous. I very well may do the opposite or I may buy calls on tech but it would all be determined on information that can only come tomorrow

One time I was on too much LSD as the hits my friend and i were going to take got wet so all of the drug soaked from their hits into at least one of mine so I did 5 instead of 2.5 and we went to a YG concert that featured a Donald Trump impersonator talking about going to a KKK rally and then getting jumped by members of the Bloods street gang and then they brought a couch and a stripper pole onto the stage with 2 fat hoodrat strippers and they were on their hands and knees going ass to ass while YG threw money in the air it was one of the most ridiculous things I've ever experienced

And then after YG was Kendrick Lamar and it was during the DAMN tour and words can't really describe how fucking dope that was

TLRY is a easy buy. 142 anytime.

It's caused a couple of environmental catastrophes but who hasn't? Seems like a steal, why am i wrong?

Yeah, even in the 90s they were starting to worry about PCBs and other chemicals. Some things kind of slipped through the cracks, though. I just want a smelloscope.
Around 6 years ago I had this girlfriend named Lisa, and one night we went out for dinner and I got a super good habanero burger. 

We got home and we’re getting it on and all of the sudden she starts like crying and was like my vaginas on fire…oh it hurts! And I look and it’s like literally inflamed and like swelling shut. 

Turns out I must’ve had habanero juice under my fingernails (I know for a fact I had washed my hands before) and it was injurious
Yes!!!!
TSLA the talk of town tonight. I picked up a 1335c at close on Friday, hoping we open at 1300 after Elon tweets out "lolz jk we're gonna do a 4:1 split" after a few more beers.

If they’re big shorts then they’d be paying attention and the broker would be calling them if they weren’t already on the phone. 

Typical retail would just be on the margin call list and get pushed to the front. They would not be forced to cover in premarket unless it it brought them to point of no return.

Stock has been running up since that local bottom on 10/20 though
Right, it was an absolutely brilliant move of Elon to stick it to the man.

Most overrated dessert ever.
We're addicted to debt. The more debt we have, the higher the market will go. Until the debt goes down (which is never), the market will keep going up. As high as the market has gone already, it's probably going to go up even higher at an even faster rate.
Ok so has anyone read or heard how the government plans on tracking and taxing unrealized gains? Seems like a shitshow to me. Best I could think of is a point in time snapshot where the gains are taxed and the cost basis is reset at the point where the taxes were assessed. 


Aka if the irs calculates Musk’s tax liability for his unrealized gains on TSLA when it’s $1230/share, he pays his taxes but then the shares he own are now considered to be at a cost basis of $1230/share. 


Besides that, I can’t think of any way a tax on unrealized gains wouldn’t be a complete farce.

Those two stocks literally never move “sharply” … what are you expecting like a 2.5% gainer?
I have plug should hopefully run up this week, earnings next week.
It turns out visual mod *does* occasionally miss 😔
Wake up at 11 and you should be good.
No fuck this guy, tell me instead
Imagine being the guy that accidentally chipped the plaster around the Golden Buddha in Bangkok in 1954.

One moment, you just broke the most important and valuable image of Buddha you know of. You're gonna die and you're going to heck and your name will be hated for all of history and your family will always be cursed because you're such a fuckup. 

The next moment, it turns out there's a gold statue underneath the plaster and you just made an important archaeological discovery.

Then it gets analyzed and stuff and it's not just gold plated but actually solid gold all the way through and you find out you accidentally discovered **the biggest fucking piece of gold EVER in human history.**

What a roller coaster. You'd believe in Buddha for the rest of your life for sure
How’s my mom she hasn’t called lately

Waste of mental spin to play mind games in relationships.

They are one of us! They belong!
Hey Elon
Heard it here first folks.
Shit is going back to NAV like every other SPAC.
There is literally no trouble he couldn't buy his way out of for .000001% of his net worth.
😔
Wow elon tesla tweet crashes 2021 stock market just before I become a millionaire. Super dumb and I'll probably have to get a day job because of him and his dumb mouth

a slight pullback is welcome after all this green, more buying to do
&gt; I'm not Elon.
&gt; I'm not into Intel and GM
Tesla sell off money is gonna flood into memestocks crapto and everywhere that’s good

I’m on the fence about LAZR. Can I still get on or have I missed the train?

“Pedos can’t help it, they’re just like the gays but with kids”
Why
I held waaaay too many calls over the weekend. I correctly predicted the infrastructure bill would be passed, but didn't realize it'd be a sell the news event.. and also Elon retard Musk would sell 10% of his TSLA shares. I'm fucked
Oh shit…Darren Sharper
Better. Share a phone.
Girls have no pp and they can make themselves and each other coom.
You’ve got hands and a mouth, you’re overqualified.
All these bears bagholding puts hoping for doomsday are just gonna get fucked like they always do

I guess my Tesla calls are fucked.
Puts.
Lol that's pretty good. That joke coin that's all of a sudden not a joke.
So close. You stud

You should have sold many days ago right out of that halt when it touched 175
Should have died
You can habitually check DEEZ NUTZ lol
No
Yeah, what an idiot. It's just another sub/Discord prepping the pump.
No but he's right though
It is way stronger so probably. Can be dangerous tho

Ignore terminator, orange juice futures are up
Puts on Roblox
Which app will Elon be using to sell his stocks?
My hedge is not supposed to be my main play, I pray it doesn’t but at same, puts on anything is just as easy as calls on everything, if you have the right attitude
I want to 😜🔫 After reading a few of the comments under the Ron W. / Elon Twitter exchange. 

How can people be so fucking stupid.

Quick quote from there:

“Elon is an innovator”

“he’s not an inventor! He’s just rich!”

🤦‍♂️
This week we put gay bears out of their misery.

Edit:  downvoted by gay bears hahaha
Yeah I am more inclined to believe this recently
Obvious bear trap is obvious
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Any time you retarded young fucks say based, youll be getting a downvote... cuz it sounds really stupid...   thats it I guess...   sigh.
Only if you eat them with me :) but thank you for making me part of your day
It might actually be you...
I am 15 now
Wat. The pe of industrials is insane right now. Most are 2-4
Pedo’s in the thread trying to rationalize themselves but too cowardly to leave their comment up for 30 seconds. Do the world a favor you sick fucks.
Jeffries just increased their tesla price target from 950 to 1450 😂😂😂😂😂
I'm dying laughing reading this sub then reading Elon's last few tweets (plus whatever his avatar is now). Is this real life?  If you step back and think this is the richest guy in the world and a trillion dollar company it's fucking insane. What an awesome time to be witnessing.
Is Dwac dead or not, unsure if I should take my tendies elsewhere (help)

Orange juice futures are up.
Yes
I flip my OJ in Hawaii, OJ gets his salad flipped in prison.
sure, the infra bill was priced in, but is the next infra bill priced in?
RIP Vine
They sell automatically if the CEO sells.
fuck.. I HATE that guy
Me
Yes, but the squishes…
My thesis going into this week was value rotation. Grabbed QQQ puts. Really hope futures aren’t teasing me right now. 

Prob green by open.
You again. Go eat rocks.
Pineapple…Daddy Elon I like it rough but this maybe more than I can handle
You mean /u/Zjz?
Man I knew it was too good to be true. Rip bull market, thanks Tesla!
Damn
I just woke up from a 10 year coma.

Why haven’t I received any of my Netflix DVDs in the mail? Are Zunes on back order? Is Amazon a good buy at $200 or should I hold my longs in Walmart? Did Tesla deliver any vehicles yet; not that EVs will be anything more than a fad anyway. Best trending videos on Vine? I love that shit.

&gt; Orange Juice Futures are down because of Elon.
Got visualmod's wife bustin on this 🍆🥵
There’s a difference between a dip and a tank
PLUG, NIO or PLTR calls?
How are orange juice futures holding up? Are they down because of Elon?
Bro it was a speed camera.
True, but I have people at TDA/Schwab that will be truthful about the phone calls they’re getting. You’re not getting that from HOPD unless you actually have friends working there
Have u been to any concerts?
Futes don’t matter until 9:29
Puts?
What does P stand for
He already sold during the weekend
Lol def not
Should have shown the cop your tits. Always works for me.
Mods wtf is happening over here, this shit has to stop
Just one?
Hoping LCID stays up
If Elon sells what does this mean for my 2 Tesla stocks?
The best dessert imo. And easy to make.
Well one was an accident and the other one the glove didn’t fit
Yea seriously I don’t know how people DIDNT realize it was priced in with slow growing boomer industrials at 40-80 P/E ratios
Why have one high end chick when you can have 30 bottom end trash chicks
&gt; You are correct. The shorts will be in a bad position if the earnings release is good for Coty. I am not aware of any rules that require pre-market trading to stop when an important announcement like this occurs, but it would likely cause some chaos and could create opportunities for people who know about the news ahead of time (like you).
(and Saturn in the 1990s)
Why are they excluding pedophiles? Are they not inclusive? In another 10 years we’re going to be moving onto pedophile victomhood and if you say something bad about pedos you’re getting cancelled 😂
Yeah I timed my tsla calls wrong too
man my gut is telling me to get those clf calls tomorrow
[deleted]
I just hate commercials
The DWAC bots out in full force
So if my thesis is the Coty blows away earnings. And they release them at 6:30. Doesn't that kind of leave the shorts in a really bad position? Like do they have to cover in the pre market?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
Or you could sell and buy back at a discount
Naked calls
$TSLA’s gonna single handedly bring down the market tomorrow…early Black Friday sale!?!?!?
Now that infrastructure bills passed gonna tank tomorrow
Did you buy DWAC? That dipped.
Way to go out on a limb there bud
your keylime pie: how do i tell him?
Elon is providing cover for JPow so it doesn’t look like it was the Fed’s fault.
Smoothbrained but I love it
OK Boomer
Thank God, bias confirmation from VisualMod makes my port hard.
[deleted]
How do you sell and yolo 🤔
TSLA -20% Monday pls 🙏 Need these 11/12 puts to print. Using profits to buy up the subsequent SPY dip.
Plug power (PLUG), all the way. I think butt plugs are becoming a re-emerging market. Take heed, boys.
Elon first thing at market open will sell puts to the haters
What’s a share?
Thinking about turning a healthy thing unhealthy because it sounds good


Cut up chicken breasts I made earlier and put it into a quesadilla
Can't knock the hustle 😂
Lol post your account balance tomorrow around 9 am
PayPal should be huge. Stocks that have a bad few weeks before earnings report tend to pop on just a little good news and it doesn’t have a lot of expectations for it.
A real metal show is not that. Metal heads are not sheep. And we go to hear the performance.
You can prob fuck his
Anyone selling all their Tesla shares tomorrow will instantly regret this 1 year from now. Tesla will be higher 1 year from now, guaranteed
I lost like 80% on mine good luck.
This is all i'm sayin'. But I got to be honest with you, I'm feelin' a lot of hate from this community here right now
No sorry should’ve specified - we just gotta pick a single stock in SPX that performs better than the index in a given week. Can beat it by .01% or 50% doesn’t matter.
Adding to my $DWAC position

Watching the Top Gun volleyball montage in slo mo
Alec Baldwin and OJ should be friends
Hope it goes proper for ya, tits and Botox sells to the poor girls well
It will be okay. The rich people will be okay. They had a really good year this year. They will sell some dog coin and pay their taxes. The money will get wasted on some stupid shit probably, but all in all everyone will continue as they are.
This is halfway legitimate advice. I’ve found that the recurring theme of this past few months is runners keep running and losers keep losing. Chasing momentum at open after a big earnings beat/loss is often a really good idea
Well good luck to you. I’m on the other side of this trade. Mostly stock but I do have a good amount of SOFI.
NDX futures imploding probably good for you and that position
That other person is Elon Musk...
sold my shits on friday for 30%, gonna keep an eye on it. expecting a dip.
Futures faker and more ghey than I could have imagined
Fair. I respect that response.
Elon tomorrow- *lol jk guys*
I’m all in on PayPal. This baby better rip or im fucked

As long as bears are bold enough post here, I never worry it won’t keep going up.
I have a feeling Elon still has one more autistic tweet left in the bag for tonight
Pussy cash gang checking in ready to go balls deep in calls
I’ll allow it
He looks pretty rich https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457497438474981384?s=21
I'm still up 700% on it so I ain't trippin
Guy posted on here yesterday and was heavily insinuating he had intercourse with a pltr insider/auditor who told him that it would go over 30 eow
I think he's too rich to buy options lol. Once you're as rich Elon, money is probably the least of your concerns lol.
Fuck daylight savings time
Almost had a 3some tonight, just needed 2 more ppl
LOOOL people don't get this joke
The cheap one
I guess the “O” is optional when it comes to anagrams
Exactly what Elon would say….I’m watching you..
Not as bad as Robinhood’s I guarantee
I made a man out of ~~her~~ him.
Gotta make drain babies.
The cheap one or the expensive one?
Where’s the nearest Wendy’s
I can’t believe there are people here who honestly believe Tesla share prices can rise tomorrow. Total delusions.
Watch it hit 1500 eow
That’s his version of shit posting on the weekend.
Based autist Elon giving us the black swan event
I keep it simple. Yellow cake with chocolate frosting.
I can’t even fathom what the person looks like on the other side of the screen who sent this
Not me
I think the qqq is going to take a shit regardless of idiot Tesla. Individual non index stocks will move up though. Coty, Sofi, that sort of thing
nyc has good laundry
I’ve come to the conclusion that intel leaps are the only way to go.
Same. I love creampie too.
You also just described DWAC

Edit: except for the share price. One to many zeros.
Gonna go hypothetical on a terrys clavical.
Go away Ben....
Imagine a world where people can be true to self and not some fucking pre programmed robot with fake written apologies on deck..

#Pro tip


When calls on something are up over 10000% at market open make sure you buy those immediately to secure 20000% gains by noon.
*If* it dips it will be an amazing buying opportunity.
[deleted]
I think in honor of this comment I’m just going to start referring to them as the Buffalo bulls and if I think a stock is going to go up I’ll say I’m billish on it.
Going to ask my TDA friends how bad it is after open
Rumble in the Bronx!
That canine one getting fukt though
Why does ur pp look like u just came?
Do you get extra credit if you make the most? My professor made it so the highest gainer got 5% more added to their final grade. No point in not coming in first, so I went all in on gold: gold futures, gold etfs, Goldman Sachs… 

I don’t know if you can beat spx by just betting on one ticker- you need to do some massive day trading. Since it’s risk free, might as well buy some Tesla puts
We haven’t even broke the lows of Friday, sad news. 🧸🍭

Listen tards. Elon is going to let the paper hands sell, others will buy the dip, Elon will sell off his stock over the next week or so, then announce some shit in December that sends TSLA to $2k or just split the stock 1:4 again and then will regain basically all he sold.
I don’t watch football. Not enough charts

Not about you homie
Wish I could call on sick just to watch the show
Elon must have bought a shit ton of puts right before tweeting: "TSLA ~~bagholders~~ shareholders should I sell some of my shares? &lt;3 xoxoxoxo"
Clov?
Call yourself a redditor if you want to sound like a jackass
Isn’t this always true?
Pray
Buying TSLA puts at open makes sense. Therefore I will buy calls instead
Exactly, so it's easy to infer he was talking about tomorrow brainiac

Also this is a thread called "What are your moves tomorrow" lmao
Lmao I wouldn’t even be mad
🍉 is just signaling a 10% pullback from the fuckhead MMs...get ready to buy the fucking dip mang...
Elon probably gets so much pussy on the low
You don’t need to lie to us bro
You need to sprinkle a little IWM 12/31 calls on that. Other than that you looking good. Don’t not forget to get some CHPT $32 weeklies @ .08 at open. Probably be .16 at open actually. $35 EOW

I was surprised it didn't close at $100 on Thursday. The people who own SAVA think it is either a $5 or a $500-$1000 stock. They aren't taking profit at $100. Too many shorts, too few shares outstanding.
i have qqq puts and spy puts and a shitload of Coty calls. Let's talk tomorrow. But Elon is an embarrassment and investors end up losing
No one ever replies to the posts.  LOL!
These dudes are horrendously alone and pour their thoughts out about being alone. AND. NO. ONE. REPLIES! reminding them they are even more alone than they thought.

Looking forward to the majority of people on here loading up on either Tesla calls / puts at the bell and then watching those options go -30% within an hour because it’s there’s one thing you can bet on, it’s the majority being unable to accurately predict Tesla’s price movements

I wonder what the stock would do.

TSLA down 50% tomorrow at least 💯

You guys really though SP500 would carry on going up this week? The bill is priced in retards, we up 12% in 1 month because of the anticipation the bill would pass. It’s time for a healthy pullback. Buy some short term puts take the gains and buy calls. Now peace
Oh interesting. I have Schwab and needed a futures account to trade anything VIX so just assumed that was the case for all major brokers
So is bill gates, the term no longer has a particular meaning, it has fallen fully into the realm of aesthetics.

Tesla stock owners are delusional. The stock should be about 100 at the most. They hemmorage money, Elon is a fucking whackjob and people will follow him into hell. Tomorrow is going to be a bloodbath, and so will the coming weeks and months. He is lucky the SEC doesn't sanction him he belongs in handcuffs. He's a fucking charlatan.

If you had $20k to dump and forget the next 2 years, what will you get: Jan 2024 QQQ leaps or ARKK leaps?
Honestly I don’t blame Travis Scott for not stopping…. Have you seen concerts these days? It’s basically a screaming match of people trying to drown out the actual music.  Concerts have literally become pointless with a bunch of shouting idots holding up phones
Someday you will be right
My puts will print so hard this week as SPY dips below $400.

Shorts wouldn’t give a shit unless there was a significant catalyst with that borrow rate. Unless borrow % jumps into the 20+% I don’t bother anymore with days to cover

It's average.  Difficult to determine a conclusion based on those two facts.  0.25% is generally the lowest borrow rate
They have 2 employees??
Market cap means nothing. Valuing your wealth based on market cap/your shares is retarded as fuck. YET that’s exactly what people do when they borrow against their shares so they can access liquidity without selling.

Just artificially inflating the ever living fuck out of equities to infinity. I would love to see the clusterfuck an unrealized gains tax inflicts on this retarded system. Dems are bluffing so it’ll never actually happen but a man can dream.

that is the first thing you have said that makes sense lol. right on the money. but i don't think tesla is the only thing going down.

I know everyone is talking about TSLA right now, but an unrealized gains tax seriously in the works has far broader effects on the market than just Musk’s position.

How is the rest of the market going to fare if the guy who swore to diamond hand his own company’s shares to the grave is planning to dump a significant amount over this? Unless this turns out to be the new “___ talks going well.”

But it was after market close, need a day to bake in 10% sale. Plus he wont just sell all at market price, this'll be a slow drop for like a month.

Bears went from fud posting to pretending their puts will print. 🌈🐻

Classic stages of denial.
That’s because it’s got a lot of bag holders lol

I used to work with a guy named Steve. We looked him up on google cause he seemed odd and he had hit an old man with his car and took the car a few towns north to get fixed. Cops caught him and served some time. He then showed up to work drunk and got fired. He was the tits.
Lol I’m a tad red on the year because I got bearish too early, but I make enough at work that it’s just play money, I think with all your confidence you should just buy that stupid car now on financing

Cheap is not relative in this case. It is or it isn’t cheap. Numbers don’t lie
#HOLY SHIT THIS IS THE END OF THE BULL MARKET
Not true I have been buying too
TSLA is like 6.4% of QQQ. The difference between Dow futures (flat) and Nasdaq futures (-0.35%) right now implies about a 6% drop for Tesla at the open tomorrow, assuming all else equal.

I see a lot of stupidity on a daily basis but I have to say…this unrealized gains tax has to be the most remarkably stupid level of stupidity I think I have ever seen in my life.

It is literally too stupid to even be funny as a joke. Like if SNL did a skit on dumb politicians and included an unrealized gains tax bill as a joke, it wouldn’t even be funny because of how ridiculous it is.

But here we are in real life with our peers in human kind actually arguing in support of it.

I swear man sometimes you just have to laugh because otherwise you have to cry.
Sell the news. 

SPY down to $450 tomorrow
Buying TSLA puts, XRX &amp; AYX calls.
Probably puts on Tesla
Second best
Sorry cash flow. It was only a couple thousand right? Still hurts but could be worse. Next time

I have an interview to be a mailman on Tuesday, pretty fired up. Half the pay of my current job, but how are you going to get stressed out driving around dropping off packages and finishing at 2pm everyday?
Thanks elon for the opportunity to buy tsla tomo before you announce another stock split.

A timely reminder:   The Great Recession of 2007-2009 was mostly caused by hedge fund guys wrapping bad mortgages up in shiny wrapping paper and saying "This is a great investment with an AAA++ rating, buy it!"

Now we have Electric Vehicle companies that roll prototype trucks without any engines down long hills, earning multibillion valuations.   "This is a great investment with an AA+ rating, buy it!" they say.

His brother selling shares is actually a pretty good indicator of short term direction of the stock.  He did it September of last year just before it dumped hard.  Also in February 2021 just before the dump.
What happened was sad and he's fukd up for his actions. This isn't the place for it.

This sub is the only real thing in the metaverse
What about heading towards it? Did you pltr getting close?

Good picks

I have said this many times , but i refuse to believe other subs have real ppl in them. It cant be true!
Puts on everything if you don't get greedy you'll always win
Travis scott is my favorite artist, people dying at his concert or him being a dick has no impact on me or his music. Still gonna fuck with him until he stops making good music. People too frequently bring morals into things, and those same people wonder why they aren’t succeeding at things. They are too blind to realize that maybe the decision that would yield them the highest benefit might not be the most moral.
Lucid Motors FTW, one more week to pump before earnings…

3 things to look out for: 1. As I mentioned before, Context Logic's quarterly earnings is soon to come out. This is going to be critical in determining the price of this stock (for now). 2. Keep in mind we are approaching the holiday season- that means Black Friday, Christmas, etc.  The high influx of revenue will make excellent support  as will be seen some time in January/February- which leads us to point three. 3. In January/February we will be expecting quarter 4 annual report for 2021. Considering the expected improved performance the stock will finally get back on track. However, we need to be realistic with our goals. I predict the stock will reach an average of $9 by the end of the year/beginning of 2022. From there, we'll probably see a back and forth on the price but should even out by the summer. By then we could see the share price reach $15. However, I would highly consider selling a good chunk of my shares if not possibl all of it. Prices any higher than $15 so soon will prove to be unstable, at least according to the expected dates talked about previously. Dont expect wish to reach $30 until 2023.

Why fuck this moron, let him short tsla and get fucking poor’d

Here’s the perfect price for a dip buy on Tesla: 1000
Lol imagine thinking that US stocks deserve 10-100 fold higher valuations than other countries because “mErIcA”. Some of y’all are about to find out the hard way that valuations matter and math doesn’t discriminate. RIP bubble boys and gYnA bears, you won’t be missed. Pouring out a beer in your memory at market open. I’m so happy to see this circus market coming back to reality and all these idiot wannabes getting generational bagholding opportunities
0DTE 465 Spy Puts wait for dip, sell that and then buy 0DTE 470 calls thank me later

TSLA puts at open..  Sell when up 10%
PFE, LCID, PLUG, NVDA
They are down 18% the past 3 months, I was considering open up a few short positions.

But Idk if they will continue to slide.

Half of their rev is actually made on a television network, which also seems asinine.
Never gonna happen.

Tell you what tho, I'll stop making new Travis Scott posts for tonight cause I appreciate that you haven't blocked me. You see me spamming about some shit you hate to see and your plan is to wait until I run out of karma cause you're not a little bitch. Real recognize real, I have to respect that

So much shit I want to buy this week. I’m overwhelmed.
What the fuck did you just fucking say about Navy Seal copypastas, you little newfag?

I’ll have you know they've ranked top out of all the comments on the Internet, and they have been translated in numerous contexts on 4chan, and have over 300 confirmed variants. Navy Seal copypastas are trained in memetic warfare and are the top copypasta in the entire circlejerk arsenel. You are nothing to them but just another target. They will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this subreddit, mark my fucking words.

You think you can get away with saying that shit about Navy Seal copypastas over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak this copypasta is contacting it's secret network of /b/tards across the USA and your IP is being doxxed right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid.

Navy Seal copypastas can be anywhere, anytime, and they can confuse you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with mad-lib permutations. Not only are they extensively trained in trolling, but they have access to the entire arsenal of Anonymous and will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the Internet, you little shit.

If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. This copypasta will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your portfolio. Your fucking 401k is dead, kid. I can trade anywhere, anytime, and I can lose fat stacks over seven hundred ways, and that's just with TSLA FDs. Not only am I extensively trained in sniffing glue, but I have access to the entire crayon collection of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass boomer stocks off the face of the continent, you little shit.

But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit crayon diarrhea all over you, the likes of which would make even Jackson Pollock jealous, and you will drown in it. You're fucking done, kiddo.
Shovel ready projects are years away. Most of the money goes into politicians' pockets anyway.

#It wasn't a real question, I know the answer. My comments about Travis Scott bother you because you kill people too and you're butthurt there are people who won't make excuses for you. This fucked up society has an agreement that you can kill as many people as you want as long as you're smart about it and it's disruptive when someone who fucking hates murderers isn't dumb enough to go along with pretending you're not responsible for everyone that dies because of choices where you betrayed your moral responsibilities.
Kind of have to get those before IV fucks you and makes the strategy unprofitable. Also works when the move is huge

I heard you got gaped last night
Literally the only thing anyone talks about on here is Tesla.
Economy on the cliff with him

So Elon is user #1 in Zucks metaverse it seems.
nicholson is just great
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
&gt; I prefer to buy OTM calls and puts.
if history has taught us anything, is that Elon will pull some shit to make stonk go up
Big cities are far better for making money too but that’s not what the original comment was about
Not me, I would never cheat on NNN (it’s just always small)
There is no way that retail is pushing TSLA up as high as it is right now. I wonder who the big players are.
Futures dropping oh lord
Hanging onto my 12/6 SPY 467c. I'm not very worried even if it thuds tomorrow. 

It's going to be an interesting week between the TSLA thing and the infrastructure deal. I'm honestly not sure what positions to take on anything.
Yeah.
There will be bids at open. Enough.
a link to a subscription service is probably nothing?
Anyone buy OTM calls and puts for earnings or just balls to the walls one way?
No, it is a joke though
That blue whale guy is gonna be banking this week.

Perfect for pulled pork sandwiches
He's on the cliff 

😂😂😂🤓
Futures bleeding so im getting cheap calls tomorrow 🤑🥰
I think about shit like this constantly and honestly idk if it's ever even happened to me but just the thought makes me perpetually embarrassed
Damn elon ditched grimes because nnn. It was right in front of us
Bears! I repeat SHE IS GONE! SHE IS WITH THE BULL AGAIN!
Think about it.. Elon is the richest dude in the world, shit like this is probably the only thing that gets his rocks off anymore lol
I can't wait for a dip to buy
As usual, red at night,  to get bers assholes soft and relaxed for the morning routine
Those kings Hawaiian rolls ain’t half bad.
So this is what it’s like to be the richest man in the world
will be bloody tomorrow 😪
Fucking elon changed from TOM RIDDLE TO LORD VOLDEMORT
Oh
Does it mean "YOU WILL GET IT IN THE NEXT SEASON"
Tsla holders bout to be on welfare tomorrow
Probably nothing 👀🍇🚀 https://www.sweepcast.com/
Yo I’m with u. 9,410 shares at $5.37. I’d love to see a jump to $10+
Thank god I’m holding these 900p 11/18
LORDE EDGE 

😵‍💫🤣😵‍💫
HUT calls going to print
remember how futas were always accurate and we never opened green and got greener after red futas?
AA isn't class.
Lorde Edge of Trollheim, the wealthiest person who ever lived.
What do you guys think on lumber wit the infrastructure bill 150 billion on affordable housing
🤡
Anyone wanna chip in to buy enough twitter voter bots so Elon doesn’t sell stock
Careful- there are good records and bad records.  That’s some genie in a bottle screw up when he gives young -18% day for not being specific.
October was bull trap. Back down to 420 we go
Rip
150/151.
Gotta stop trying to catch falling knives
Holding Tight on WISH stock. I got 10,000 shares averaged at 6.40 and I aint letting go. Hope to see a nice quarterly report on November 10th.
I’m the first rung. Bought puts last week.
Lucid lucid lucid
Politicians with far deeper pockets than the average Musk fanboy will short TSLA

RIP your calls
🌽 

👀
Tesla is 2.94% of SPY, so as long as general spy holdings go green, no issues with tesla being an outlier red.
Not gonna lie would love a nice Affirm dip to get in
To pump TSLA share price above $2000
Big bear futures trap
If you aren't playing TSLA tomorrow you aint black
I remember once I tried to make a joke in front of class during a presentation and it bombed so hard. I think it took a couple years off my life
Why does ur pp look like u just came?
Say that to the SEC
Buying a put on $TSLA with a strike price of $1.2k, expires Friday. Max return: $116k. Max liability: $3.3k
CRASH AND BURN BOYS
Was it buying deep otm weekly puts on tesla?
  Holy shit bankruptcy stocks never going up again
Zero effort 💩 post
I missed the ATVI earnings call what exactly happened that made it tank so hard? A quick google search says they basically met expectations on revenue and beat on EPS. Why a 20% drop? How bad was guidance?
4.0 inch pp maybe
Saw a med kit on the ground as I turned the corner also. Shit about to get real
Think we start at 465 and then it’s $5 either way.
931 am, IRS tweets “lol. Our office. Bring your checkbook”
Nah, it is his fault, others fault as well. But he is hugely to blame
futures better be a prank ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Edgelord Musk
It could drop, or not. Buying puts likely won’t be profitable because it’s not going to be some catastrophic 40% crash like all the bears seem to be so certain of.
#futures are 🌈 and mean nothing - super GREEN tomorrow
You’re right, but I want people to sell so I can buy the dip. So shut up cultist.
For sure - no doubt this name should be higher. Can’t imagine their business has slowed down. $PINS rump was totals overreaction
Wtf lol
It's a thing called hard drugs.
So someone behaving like a proper WSB resident? Wow.
&gt;becoming
Imagine being retarded enough to trade on news that everyone heard about over the fucking weekend
lorde edge. what is coming. why did the music intensify.
I see like 6 gme ban bets a day. They keep coming
1. For all of you who apparently don't know--ya boy elon is only selling shares to pay his tax bill and exercise his options. *Whatever happens on that dumb fucking Twitter poll is irrelevant.* Again, selling shares to exercise options for a total *larger* exposure to TSLA than he currently has. Not really that bearish.


2. A lot of you are clearly unfamiliar with [the Elon musk market theory](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-10/elon-musk-tweets-great-news-for-bitcoin-bad-news-for-econ-majors). As we all know, the markets at large have been disconnected from fundamentals for a very long time. Specifically in regards to Elon musk: he has a cult following with *so much* retard strength, this Monday morning dip (if there even is one) will be weak, unsustained, and more flaccid than your father. Bears' assholes (the ones dumb enough to open short positions) will be once again ruined, and the toothless SEC will never do a thing about Elon blatantly manipulating the markets once again. Welcome to the new world
Elon trolling hard. Too many rubes.
Great way to lose the rest.
Sorry guys. Bought PYPL calls for tomorrow
Waiting for the sting makeup and black trench coat
He'll back with his new spack.
#I make my text large and bold because I'm calling out liars and I'm outnumbered. Think about how much of a fucking bitch you are to be annoyed by that while you're sitting here saying it's not his fault he FUCKING CHOSE TO HAVE PEOPLE DIE FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHATSOEVER MULTIPLE TIMES IN A ROW ON VIDEO INSTEAD OF CHOOSING TO TRY TO PREVENT DEATHS THAT WERE HAPPENING BECAUSE OF HIM
Hoping this week will be insane. Affirm, paypal and palantir.
Not worth the risk I’m just hoping for a dip to add on to my longs. PayPal will be 500 by 2023-2024
people who say i am not a financial advisor are the worst vismod. dont stoop to their level.
Probably Nucor calls honestly. With the new infrastructure bill being passed I believe American made steel will be very bullish
So is TSLA fuk?
ShOrT lAdDeR aTtAcK oN tEsLa!!!
Yea plenty of people made money off PTON and Z. I just don’t see much DD for bearish cases except during the night.

And I rarely ever see DD on single stocks that is bearish.

Like we all see the 🖍 TA for indexs, but where the fuck is the juicy DD for pton/Z?
Can I please see a picture of your position I really don’t believe you
Thinking about dumping my BNGO leaps and getting some SPY Call Weeklies if it drops Mon/Tues
this is full retard mode
#All that’s left is for Lorde Edge to tweet **GME 🤔** and the market enters complete pandemonium tomorrow
Why did musk change his name to LORDE EDGE🤯🤯😰😰
That's Lorde Edge to you now son
i-is elon becoming… insane(?)
I was given a free share of $F from Webull last year. I'm up 170%. My best performer is my smallest position. Largest positions are all bags.
Futures taking a dump on a glass table
🤔
I believe you somehow
Might hit PYPL puts on ER. Sucks this name is already down bad
Yes
The downvotes and the bitching at me
I GOT POOTS AND I AM JAZZED UP
Elon has gone crazy (again)

Tsla $420 EOY
Lmao imagine getting banned from ban bets
Eww, VR. ER is where the action will be at. VR adoption will stay at very low levels, it's not practical, nor is it feasible. It's a gimmick.
no TSLA stocks = sleep better at night.
also wsb: anything you say master.
[deleted]
At 9:29, Elon tweets "sike."
Too late for coin mining stock calls at open?
Ooooo oooooooo 🤖
Ya it took a bit of time to parse.

"the bread" makes it sound like the one associated with the order, while "a coleslaw" sounds like a generic one aka replace the item associated with the order with one that isn't yet.

If it came with 2 coleslaws, it would make more sense

anyways, have you tried calling him a retard?
People always TSLA is overvalued. Sure 1.2T is excessive, but TSLA has no competition. Nobody has the supply chain, technology, and talent to compete with them
Oh snap, VM throwing it down.
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/rentmypie** bet **TSLA** goes from **1216.7** to **1277.54** before **2021-11-14 19:49:24.409048-05:00**
No. He’s selling as he needs to pay tax on his stock options. See CNBC
Market will moon. We all know what's going to happen.

Green by close today. Easy.
He meant a model car
Lorde Edge.  Lmao
Currently have a guy spamming me about his 11/8 485 spy calls that he’s going to make bank on 

They didn’t even have a bid on Friday we are at peak retarded
&gt; I have a 4.0 at Harvard
the same price it opened Monday
So you're saying Tesla stock price will drop tomorrow? Am new and trying to learn
!banbet $TSLA +5% 7d
OCGN
oh it doesnt. what gave you that impression?
Hes absolutely checking WSB periodically to see our reactions after every tweet.
3:17 PM · Nov 6, 2021

Does this mean he will sell on March 17th at 11:06am?
Looks like it. Elon, you're pushing 50. This shit isn't funny.
i longed TLT after DWAC fiasco with month out Calls and it worked out pretty well.
What he said
Because it's not his fault and it's fuckin stupid and you make the text large and bold and it's annoying
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Buy puts on Live Nation or gtfo WSB
lol good one bro!
My mothers on her way out! We all are, act accordingly! Best line ever
Elon is a clown. He's the sole reason I don't own a Tesla. I wouldn't give him a dime
How is everyone feeling on coin calls? Might sell mine and get back in the following day so I don’t hold through earnings
Futures red, I blame Elon. Fk that autistic bitch.
Thoughts about AAPL EOW
PLTR gonna fly on its ER
&gt; I am not a financial advisor. I do not understand the question.
Everyone downvoting my Travis Scott comments and bitching at me too vaguely to make sense of
Holy shit he did
Praise gawwed
I'm sure I will be.  It will be just as bad as uwmc. But that's why it'll be a very small position
anyone looking to play blnk? probably picking up feb leaps tomorrow. price target around 60-80 by eoy.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
It’s the worst man
FCK WE GOING TO MOON BOYS... GET YOUR PUTS READY.... BERS AND PIGS GET SLAUGHTEREDDDDD
True, it could turn green by open
Guys look it’s optionsandtren
Shares gang reporting in.
#You forgot the part where the same police department that took out Martin Luther King is pretending nothing happened

Night is the time of dreams
Playing spy and mega caps dips. Not touching infrastructure plays or tsla cause I have no feel for it. It’s weird. I’ll play Amazon but I won’t Tesla.
Did he just change his Twitter name to Lorde Edge?
I was going to post something funny but then changed my mind
Stock? You'll be very underwhelmed
Literally nothing needs to that’s not big of a drop. Markets have red days all the time
Finally we can see some fucking red for once. I get sick and tired of every day mooning
look no one is for free speech more than i am but if you say one word that could even possibly be interpreted as bad about jpow i think you should be banned for life. that seems fair.
Bullish on SQQQ
schadenfreude
#Why does it bother you when I talk about the fact that Travis Scott should be arrested?
LORDE EDGE
...he will buy them back pretty quick, so no net change even in that ticker.
Of course it red. TSLA is going to crash the market.
Where else are we gonna post?
You’ll see some tomorrow big boi
My bad I was looking at the 11/10

Dude there’s no bid you cannot sell those 

How many did you buy?
More weed would sure help with the chill part, huh?
&gt; It's called COD Vanguard because it is the most trusted, reliable and low cost investment company in the world.
Love waking up to a mouth working me over
[deleted]
I'm thinking about getting a little of rolls royce
Mmm, looks like it was good to be mostly cash over the weekend, time to buy the dip again and again lol,
It’s either really hot or really cold here we need weed
BULLPHORIA
No…

Do you need to be experiencing impending catastrophe to be concerned about a negative short term outlook? I’m just long delta my man
I miss 🥭 man’s Twitter machine. News cycle too slow imo. I want to be entertained.
[deleted]
Why is it called COD Vanguard? What was wrong with COD Fidelity, COD BlackRock, COD Invesco etc??????
I mean, I’d say you need to wait until market open before you get too excited about them.
Or maybe you just want to stack that cash and do whatever you want in a small town
a bunch of idiots squished themselves to death.  Who cares...
Elon : i see you as my cult followers

Wsb : you become the very thing that you have promise to destroy.
Money flowing to the coins
Just wait until you wake up

May be in the minority but I love that daylight savings time ended. I love dark depressing weather.
Puts on his face.
I disagree, I think a lot of people are very interested when the market opens.
A set of weeklies or one week out at the wrong time can just trash you're account suddenly. I've learned to never go all in with TSLA.
To be honest alot of bears get Puts in individual stocks. I’m sure you’ve seen the gain porn on Z and PTON Puts. 

I have no problem buying calls, but don’t get so deluded to think stocks move permanently in a 100% straight line up forever.
Kimbal has been selling for years Lmaoo like literally every month / every other month. 

Obviously they know it’s overvalued but yeah it’s nothing new, it’s ALWAYS been overvalued
#What's the matter you little bitch?
Feels good to be non - Fomo for real. People holding Tesla must have some adrenaline going right now though . 😆

Doritos locos cheesy Gordita crunch dude

Chose the right time to  buy puts 🙏🏼
OH then nevermind lol
I have calls but my heart is telling me that this is exactly what is going to happen
I’m one of the few people who like the time change. I used to hate it but now since I don’t go outside anymore, I prefer it to be dark so sitting in the house for 4 days straight is more acceptable since I’ll only be up for 5 hours when it’s bright.
Futures are Red, which means BERS are fuked tomorrow.....neverthless my accounts will still be in shambles 🤡
Are you completely leveraged in 0dte?
Don't touch that cat! :/
Loading up on 1/22 calls
Since I joined this sub over a year ago, ber had to have impeccable timing to make any money, and most of them just lost.

Why would I ever think they'd be right *this time* 

I'm literally okay with them having a win one day because they're getting so desperate I kinda feel bad.
Must feel incredible
“Why does your pp look like you just came??”

Elon Musk's options expire next year. He will owe roughly $15B in taxes. Twitter poll is a smokescreen, he needs to sell a lot of shares.

Puts on ron .
This is a society
You were blocked from ban bets for repeated non-serious / spam custom bets
Bro. This is not the place.
Dude my HUT story is one of constantly thinking about getting in, then not doing it, then watching the fucking thing moon.  Over and over.  I could have had thousands of shares at $5. But noooooo
Well Muskie may have fucked all of us…

This ain’t looking pretty
Selling everything tomorrow including my house, car and cat
!banbet SPY 500 1m or I’ll let u/cashflow_ suck my cock
I think pp refers to profile pic, but your question remains valid.
Red at night…

BAN
He has too much power i see vader in him
Show us
#No thanks, you might not understand this since your state doesn't respect human rights or the constitution but telling me to shut the fuck up actually has zero effect on me!
Same, I have an overly wet mouth
I smell panic, will buy some puts on TSLA to hedge the rest of my portfolio
Anyone playing COD Vanguard? Zombies mode is hot garbage but multiplayer is fun af🔥🔥 I’m buying more ATVI leaps on Monday
Honest question 🐻, you seem moderately coherent. Why do you only mount these “skirmishes” at night? 

When market opens I see no 🐻.
Check corn

Travis Scott did nothing wrong

#Travis Scott should be arrested
Tesla dip from Monday to Wednesday
Tlry getting ready to take off again 🚀
Great I sold my fucking HUT calls Friday FML 🤡🤡🤡
Open interest indicates the total number of option contracts that are currently out there.
&gt; The S&amp;P500 is up 0.17% today, so the future price will be higher than it was yesterday!
No calls but a good stack of shares, feeling good about em for sure
What if you're a politician and so much of your life is putting up an image and playing by unwritten social rules and one of the most influential, brightest mind in US publicly goes after your pp size in public. Would you be mad that he will never face repercussion or jealous?
you're too smart --- you don't really belong here.
[deleted]
VR gonna be the new internet
This is based on -0.17 futures?? Get a grip!
He’s kinda been saying that for awhile now
It’s his fault but he’s not going to jail. Very legal very cool
&gt; I'm not a bear. I just think Tesla is overpriced and will never be profitable
[deleted]
He’s selling in advance of stock split which will cause it to rally 60%+, so the SEC can’t claim he sold on insider knowledge.
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

Does trickle up economics even work? 

Find out on the next episode of Dragon Ball Z.
Not a bear but honestly you expect TSLA to go up every day? It’s up 60% past month. It’s worth 1.2T - more than all car manufacturers combined together. It needs a healthy pull back. Maybe to 900-1000$ before another run.
Lol, you are true autist
There’s always a bull market somewhere- some retard.

RIOT calls plz moon
Calls on CLOV and SDC. I’m at the end and this is it
#Continuing your show while you know people are dying - and insulting people who beg you for help, on video, just to acknowledge for the court's sake that you know you're killing people - is 3rd degree murder at best, or 1st degree murder if it can be proven causing deaths was the intent of how the show was set up. If you think there's any possibility where this isn't lil Travy's fault legally, you do not understand the law. He is the easiest scapegoat to send to prison out of this whole thing but Houston PD is pretending he didn't do anything wrong.
No idea what's gonna happen tomorrow but I hope it's dramatic af so I can dip my cup in and out for quick tendies.
Yup, it's stupid
Hahaha, Engineer, get the fuck out of here bot
[deleted]
I bought calls so you are probably right
Simpler. Buy them any time next week
To be fair, he’s also a billionaire because he has like… a billion dollars (and I still do not)
Spy 450 eow so we can all buy the fooking dip again
🎶”it’s lit”
Cocaine is a helluva drug.
Whoever's in COIN calls gonna be happy tomorrow.
Lmao I remember Tuesday at market open seeing all the excited bears and even saw some peeps excitedly saying how they we’re buying puts... then suddenly TSLA just chilled out ended the day down 2% and Wednesday it went back up and exceeded Monday close. I kind of feel bad for all the bears who will excitedly buy puts tomorrow just to have them bleed out and become worthless.
Waking up
To spy at 469 would be just dandy
CHPT seems like a good play
Even if it passes, I don't think it'll stand on supreme court. There is no precedent of any sort of unrealized gain tax
My calls and my mental health depend on this
It’s not market manipulation if you tweet it
Why everyone tripping on a 20b pull out of Tesla by Elon when the Maket Cap is 1.2T that’s like a - 1% day better not sell pussies
Why would anyone talk about shit company? Prly gonna miss earnings again and print another trillion shares or so
Spy 460 tmrw ?
Elon fuckikg crazy.   

PP CAME LOL
Same types of people that sold baba under 200 because CNBC said it was going to zero for the fourth FUD cycle to get cheap shares in a row
DaFUQ??? this MF is nuts
Yeah that makes sense but I don’t know if the way he said it makes sense
For biggest drop since March 2020
Cathie
I think you have to be 🅱️etarded to lash out at politicians 

He may as well have just burned his money
Please give me a GOOGL dip this week I’m ready to go all in and call it a year gimme a nice entry daddy Sundar
Gotta stop drinking that spiked punch man, it’s not healthy for you.
Heyyyyy now
Not even my alt account, just trying to share a great DD. Curious why you think HIMX sucks though? Theyre literally smashing every single earning metrics for every quarter and trading at 4x multiple. Lets keep buying WISH and DWAC though
Anyone buying $PTON?
Oh yeah, didn't you have two shipping containers a minute ago?
It’s worth seeing. For sure. But don’t expect more than a half assed reference to the other Marvel timeline.
What's the deal with these yellow flairs?
Elon literally selling the top and it's because his fans on Twitter "asked him".  That's why he's a billionaire and you're not.
I have thought the same myself many times yet the shit kept going up
Nope
that's like buying a rick and morty cart.

lmfaooooooooooooooooooo

this won't age well
It could be worse you could have bought spy calls at 470 or QQQ calls at 400. 

IWM calls printing guaranteed
And came… to a politician 🤔
That is only like a 7% drop , tsla is up 60% past month. I feel like it could retrace back to 1020 level
Let's hope spy breaks a record monday
$PAVE call. If there is a bump from the infrastructure bill, you'll see it there.
#8K TV THE BEST
I had no idea Live Nation was public. Puts it is!
at first i thought he was retarded, but I think he's onto something. I think his way makes more sense if you remove the 'the' before bread and put it before coleslaw

&gt; substitute bread for the coleslaw
Ron Wyden just came
If it sounds simple then it is!
So big Tesla dip tomorrow?

The proper order is 'no slaw, extra bread'.
There is a sea of green in anticipation of that big beautiful bill that was passed 🥰🥰🥰
Calls on BYND &amp; AMD, waiting for a SBUX pull back to by more calls, and then TSLA weekly put followed by calls as soon as the puts pop.
Welcome to every Scorsese film ever
Just might, will get the results of PowerBall on Wednesday.
I just transferred $186 out of PayPal - bearish
Can you imagine how retarded people are that buy tsla at that price? 🎒
Omfg that's awesome.
Chinese bull market, biotech growth, fintech growth, and yea that’s pretty much it
Nah because Jonas brothers are on tour
We live in times
Okay but that’s not what I’m asking. I need this debate settled
Looking forward to John Wick 4
Will probably keep selling off till it bottoms out and then pop when they release news of their beta
All expire Friday this week

The things that are not priced in haven't been priced in yet.
Tomorrow I just need to ignore the market harder than Travis Scott ignores people.
You'd be surprised. If the market was easy to ~~manipulate~~ predict* we'd all be rich
Like he’s gonna eat an IRS fine on billions in taxes just cause social media says lol go for it. This is just scoring extra points on something he has to do anyway. 

It’s like Bezos doing a poll on whether he should spend billions on green climate efforts. Obviously the answer is yes. But he’s already committed to and already sent the money. A poll makes him look good on social media for something he’s already doing and was gonna do anyway.
I need help
Fuck yeah, you use your alt account to back yourself up. WISH sucks, HIMX sucks, end of story
Musk is going off lol
Catalyst for market crash. Elon sells Tesla shares. Who knew
Yes he said that last time and he got 2 coleslaws. He’s wrong and didn’t want to admit it
Is live nation going to dump because of astroworld?
No but I’m sure you have bby girl
He fucked up bigly

You mean the monthly subscription costs half a theater ticket? Cause I'd argue it's even less considering you get so much more with the subscription.

Everyone is greedy they just have different ideas about how to make money.

So Elons owns the stock market now ?
If all the tards screaming about GME would just do ban bets we'd be rid of the noise for a week
Are you making more then 10M this year?
Yeah that sux azz
If that were the case I’d make 200k. I doubt it friend.
No he’s right. You substitute what you want for what you have

Okay help me settle a debate. I went out to eat with my grandparents. We went to Raising Canes and I got the box combo or something. It comes with chicken, a bread, and a coleslaw.

My grandpa said **substitute the bread for a coleslaw**. Meaning he wants 2 breads instead of one bread one coleslaw. 

Shouldn’t he have said **substitute the coleslaw for a bread?** Doesn’t this lead to 2 breads? His way means 2 coleslaws right?

HELP
And screw up Rivian’s IPO and LCID’s momo in the process.  Brilliant.

Fuck Elon what about my Grwg calls n red mj bill
What’s a reasonable price ? Because 2 weeks ago it was at 900$. This dip might not even go below 1000$
I wouldn’t touch it until it pulls back under 700, I’m not bagholding to break even in 2030
If they decide to tax unrealized gains, can I claim unrealized dependents on my tax returns? Everyday about 500 million of my unrealized dependents sift through drain...

You'll be ok. You don't reek of desperation and you're allowed to be sad over a big life transition. It's just scary rn bc it feels like you're missing something bc when you share years with someone, so much of your identity and security is tied to being with that person. But you were doing so well before they came into your life so you'll be ok walking alone for awhile. Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together. Work on your vision and be prepare for better things to come.

People in small towns tend to settle much younger. By 28 you’re pretty much stuck with divorced single moms. In places like NYC where people are more career focused it’s rare to get married before your mid 30s. There is just 1000x more single women available to you. Especially if you’re a high earner with a good career.
Better worry about how much longer you can carry your GME and DWAC bags. 🤡

🅿️🅿️ don't even work no more
I mean based on its weighting TSLA could drop 10% tomorrow and if all other things remain equal S&amp;P would go down a whopping 0.169%
You can tell it's about time for a pullback when everyone here thinks they are a Captain Jean Luc Picard of investing when they are really a Wesley Crusher

Same regurgitated game YoY, I enjoyed the MW of last year or so. Other than that. Not impressed.
Spy stop I have a family
I have been selling way OTM weekly puts against 3/2023 550p, for crazy premium given how far they are from spot. Normally I roll them on Fridays but this week I waited to see what Monday brings. It's hard to see TSLA falling below about 800 in just one week though, unless there is a real crashy crash. You can probably buy some super high strike VIX calls and adequately hedge against that extreme outcome if you are worried about that.

My Tsla $900 banbet might actually hit

But yeah, TSLA will probably go way, way higher but not because analysts say so
I’d like to buy around $700-800 tbh 

Anything over that is a little wild even for TSLA imo. 
Idk maybe I’ll bite

Remember this is how a sell off works, we'll use $TSLA tomorrow as an example.

**Tomorrow:** Institutions sell, WSB buys the "dip"

**Next Few Days:** Retail Sells

**Next Couple of Weeks:** Twitter traders, Youtubers and newbie investors sell

**Two Months Later at the Bottom:** WSB sells their bags, Institutions buy the dip

And repeat.
Tesla call holders got absolutely screwed. He had to do it on a weekend too

Why does ur pp look like u just came?


Bro has no chill.
Mine are not naked, so it’s a little less scary. But 

$970P &amp; $820P for this Friday 

That $820 is safe…. The $970 tho who knows
Same shit I heard at $200, $300, $400, $500, $600, $700, $800, $900, $1000.

&gt; The futures market is a zero sum game. In order for TSLA to go down, someone has to buy it.
Eh. I’ve considered the possibility. But I’d rather be alone than miserable and having my soul sucked out on a daily basis. 

I want those things too, but the older I get the less appealing it is. I have a friend who’s 53 that has a 2 year old, 1 year old, and one on the way and he confided to me the other month that he’s now realizing he’s too old for that shit
Imagine not knowing LMAO!
SoFi this is your time to shine
Fidelity over here sending snail-mail that says my 4 year old daughter with a passive S&amp;P portfolio has gained more than me this year 😠
Quick question for anytime smarter than I am.  If TSLA getting crushed tomorrow, and TSLA such a large percentage of that index, why aren’t futures in the toilet?   I’m a retard so all answers valid.

Only way for $PINS now is up

Yep a Palantir Skynet.
if the market were healthy, there would be some down days for consolidation. most ppl just wanted SPY to moon. I long as well. just saying
Self sabotage is pretty common among guys who long for things that aren't there. Maybe take some time to self reflect and take up new hobbies to get yourself used to the new you. When we're in a long term relationship and it ends, we're so used to the habit of dating we forget how to enjoy our own company for our own sake.
Just keep investing with the DD on wsb, you’ll lose weight from the losses in no time
&gt;SPY and QQQ technicals are just about as overbought as you can get

That is a shocking development, thanks for the 6 month's old news.
Futs barely red = green af tomorrow

Puts are super cheap right now too with VIX at 15. Hedging is a no brainer, but then again most people here don’t have brains.
LOL what strike? Me too dude, I sold a bunch of naked puts on tsla. I also want it to go down so I can rebuy after selling at 1050

Why is everyone in this sub so bullish. SP500 up 12% past month , isn’t it a good idea to steam off dip about 3-4%?

Weekly SPY, AMD, NVDA calls. 

made TSLA too. 

Bulls riding into 2022
Hard to say, I am betting for a NVDA led run and AMD picking up steam from it. Last weeks run kind of threw a wrench into the plan but let’s see what this week looks like.
Oh that’s good to know
Thanks for the link

I really think it will go up after the event AMD been surging past month
Don't get forget to feed your chickens in the back

Daily and weekly RSI are maxed out. Pull back is inevitable.
Yes I’m pretty sure I stink of desperation right now
Until the Fed has the balls to actually raise interest rates (they don't), the market will just keep going up. We'll see some small pull backs of 3-7% here and there but that's about it.

Nonfiction translation.
Bro… futures are red. Also open interest is the amount of those calls that are out there, not one person’s holdings. The retardation in this comment is too great even for this sub’s standards.
Bbby hits $30, Zillow rebounds to $70. Pton flat Monday, rebounds Tuesday. Ford hits $20. Tesla down 10%.

When do I buy?
Some ways to make actual real money on TSLA. [Here is one account ](https://imgur.com/a/Gv0LK2e). 

The current LEAPS was a 1/2023 $500 that was rolled up and out for credit of a few grand and was green at that time. Did this like 5 weeks ago. That $55O LEAPS was bot w shares that were green before that. 

Another account had a $650 1/2024 I sold last week and bought some shares and have cash on hand to buy more. 

Selling CSPs on margin and CCs over these LEAPS has also garnered a lot of realized premiums. 

Or you can listen to folks that never show tickets and missed the greatest bull run in history. 

The $26BN in $TSLA Elon would sell is barely over 2% of their $1.24T market cap and no one ever said it would be dumped all at once. Web Bust literally just raised their price target to $1800 and look wat other analysts recent target upgrades wer. 

I am not telling you to buy or sell Tesla, you do you. Wat I am saying is be smart and make that money and fuk the haters.
I hope not. A lot of my friends are settled down I’m one of the few single ones.
Lemme suck your cock and balls.

A little over a month ago, NVDA was at 197. Now it's 300. Should have bought calls and/or shares. I had the capital FML.

Musk's Twitter reach is a joke. He has 62.7m followers and only 3.5m voted with 42% voting NO. He absolutely thought that an overwhelming amount would vote NO. Way overplayed his hand. Time for negative gamma.
futures are irrelevant as fuck. especially sunday's opening
That’s fine, the overall trend is fucking skyrocketing so the dip is gonna be bought in milliseconds.

There was just some things about her I couldn’t shake in the back of my head to be with her long term. This manifested itself in my actions subconsciously into how I treated and cared about her and led to her being very unhappy at the end and she finally ended it with me. Deep down it’s what I knew needed to happen but now that I’m actually here I worry I’m going to regret it because we did get along so well

&gt; Splinters are small, sharp pieces of wood that enter the skin. They can be removed by pulling them out with tweezers or your fingers, but sometimes they break off and remain in the body. If this happens they may cause irritation for some time until they work their way to the surface where you can then remove them more easily.
Does Elon have paper hands?
What’s the event for? I haven’t heard about it
Did you bareback him?
What the fuck are splinters in the context of sucking your own dick and why does everyone know this?

Not a chance. I do think when this EV bubble pops it will lose 80% of its market cap but the company will survive just fine. Like AMZN in early 2000s.

There should be a consolidation soon, but that's good for the rocket. It's bull season.  Just don't panic on a dip, it's always good to consolidate.

Yeah I'm in the construction industry, terrible time to do that during the holidays I'm dropping so much on tools and a trailer. Yoloing on myself for a change after I hit big on Tesla and GME this week
Give me a taste
Just remember when Tesla dropped 40% in March? Elon wasnt even selling 30 Billion dollars worth of Tesla then.
Are you 12? He literally said he doesn't have 15 billion on hand to pay the tax. I don't think anyone in the world has 15 billion readily available.
This is good advice thank you.
I just remembered the time I had to clean up homeless poop. 

I fucking hate poors.
People have been staying where they’re at for a couple years and that’s why HD us at meme stonk levels. Thanks to Brandon. That’s over now so inventory will be rising. Let’s face it the real estate market is creaking like the Titanic right now. Zillow is selling it’s inventory at massive losses and so are the largest developers in China. China’s housing market is the biggest asset class in the entire world…that will take down the NA market as well.
In your ass, sure.

Ooofff big drop
I sold puts. I’ll lose money if TSLA goes down. But I still think it’ll drop hard once retail buys the fear
The historical average yield for SPY on any given day is +.3%. On Monday, it's above average at around .8%. 

SPY is sitting at 468 so in order for your calls to print it would need a &gt;4% gain which is a return just outside of 4 standard deviations, so less than a .1% chance. Best of luck to you.

Can't force success in any part of life I reckon.

But you can be proactive, good luck my guy.
You don't miss her, you miss not being single. Last month? Give it some time, work on yourself and stop worrying about it. Worrying will make you stink of desperation. Get comfortable being on your own and then you will be appealing to others. Your roommates will all be single again a few months after moving in with their girlfriends.
Dude. You’ve got plenty of time. Breakups suck the big one for sure. Just give yourself time. If you have to constantly remind yourself of the reasons it wasn’t working. 

I’m 35 and just ended it with the 24 year old I was with. At first it was awesome. Then i got tired of being belittled, demeaned, yelled at, and out down. A week and half out I’m struggling with missing her then I remember all the shit and it’s okay.
I yolo’d amc, did I do good?
I am thinking the same.  Way too much 🌈🐻 talk about TSLA from everyone.  The MM know to inverse WSB after they take their money.

Thr following excerpt is from a cnbc bit about Musk's tax bill being the reason for selling shares:

"When asked at the Code conference about borrowing against such volatile shares, he said, “Stocks don’t always go up, they also go down.”

Guess he's not a fellow ape.
Best way to get over a girl is to get under another one
What’s more likely. 440 or 500 spy 1/21
Do you want to be happy with yourself, or happy for a few seconds eating some candy? Slowly switch yourself/find something to help curb.
Its a bad sign that this place isnt overrun with bears talking shit.
My dude. LFG.

Go for it my dude
So TSLA droppin tomorrow?
Your asshole is in for a wild surprise my guy

SPY predictions? Am I a bag holder right now
What did he do? All I heard was he said he’s super sad about what happened.
Chic Fil A is way overrated and I’m from atlanta
Should I put Tesla
Futures are fake and I doubt SPY will be red again in 2021
Fuck yeah don't forget the little guy!
Getting mentally prepared for another day of jaw dropping losses on my MRNA position tomorrow. Good chance we go sub $200 IMO
Sugar free jello bruh
I would argue mortgages being down is good for HD.

Tips for moving on after a breakup? 28 years old here my 22 year old gf of 2 years broke up with me last month. While I was dating her this is what I wanted so I subconsciously forced her to break up with me. Now that I’m actually single I miss her fuck tons and worry I’m going to end up alone seeing all my friends settling down and I’m just getting older. Been hitting the gym hard and working a lot, have a good job and good financials but still feel lonely. My roommates are moving out with their girls soon and I just feel like I’m getting left behind and it feels bad
Chicks aren’t even open to saying Hi anymore

I swear tinder was better 4 years ago. Was good for an occasional lay from a cute girl. Got back on during the pandemic and it was awful, just instagram advertisement.

Christmas shopping season is going to be a shambles. Supply chains are hopelessly backed up and it’s not expected to get better anytime soon. Expect all the last minute shoppers to get caught off guard when all of their stuff doesn’t arrive until 2022. 😃

Looks like a lot of kids are gonna be getting Robux for Christmas this year.
I was told there would be huge massively green futures due to the bill passing ?

You'll be surprised to find out how many people think it looks awesome once it's on the road in a year. I bet you may even change your mind.
&gt; At the time of your question, it was not just you.
bears , there is no way you say market crash all weekend to let futures turn green right?
I think they should do the next federal election on Twitter that way everyone can vote, even Russia.
The bill was the hype the passing is the nudes
Why does everyone hate cash flow now?
FUCK! I have puts, red futures scare me. Gonna be green by morning guaranteed
Recently got out of a 4 year relationship.. is it just me or are chicks not as open to hooking up these days? 4 years ago it was all the rage

Lmao 🤣 I love Visualmod
Don’t doubt ur vibe 🎵
Yep
Wow you guys are clearly wrong
Don’t play ER. Enter positions after ER
see what happening? I have calls right now too but you guys are fucking retards acting like futures going from -.18% to flat means we’re gonna moon tomorrow. Like yeah I hope we do but flat futures is literally the epitome of not knowing fucking anything at all about what is gonna happen

Lord have mercy on the souls of those who trespass against us, when they come to take our guns and get lit up like it’s Christmas.

Ok so WSB is bullish on TSLA but why?
He’s gotta sell to pay those billionaire taxes. Brandon said so. Let’s see what happens and who gets fleeced
Yes
If you can stomach Monday you will be happy by Friday. Or sell at open and buy back in an hour or two later to make even more.
The popping of the economic bubble and impending collapse of the global economy and dissolution of the United States as we know it is priced-In

Doing the opposite of whatever that insufferable numbskull says would be a great way to invest!

Folk got zero fucks for Zucks. We care about 🍉....
Since we changed our clocks, the casino opens an hour earlier tomorrow right
Of course, but why not make money on the pullback?

Every time
Pretty much gona be hilarious tomorrow
😂😂😂

Damn I missed all the fun
I think we could see a sell off at open just bc ppl fearful over TSLA but I think it will recover by end of the day
What's coming to crater this week after earnings like chgg or pton? All my earning plays last week got fucked. Had Roku calls and Pins puts.

Was thinking of Dash puts. Good idea?
Who knew that after Burry the final boss was actually Elon...

She’ll buy back in at a higher price, watch
Nope
I do understand that. We’re likely headed to a recession next year which will be good for Sin stocks like alcohol, tobacco and WEED. Weed is your friend when the world sucks.

ok why don't you tell me who's the president in 4 years too
Doubt. Headed back to 800 and change but will continue to grind from there
Lol actually those butter burgers slap
You're blind if you think he's washed he was literally MVP last season lol he's undeniably one of the best QBs in the game if not the best

The packers org also holds some responsibility here but I'm most disappointed in Rodgers he's such an embarrassment right now
66 billion investment in rail systems. Fuck yayr.
Bears really just gonna let futures for green??

No

SPY dips in the morning and stay flat. Timing is everything
Elon is basically going to double the short interest on Tesla. It was already the largest short position in history by dollar value.
Was gonna downvote, and saw your flair.

Well done 👍🏽
Lose half money available funds in premarket. Then put the remainder into my yolo Obseva
Flooding is going to start from Tesla to LCID, TWTR 🚀🚀
Nice
Do you think Elon will sell his shares on Robinhood?
Lol bro
I prefer my fast food more Christian tbh
Show us on the doll where $TSLA touched you. Looks like it's been traumatizing you since it's been living in your head rent-free.
Pretty small ball but good luck sir
Zuck sells FB stock on a daily basis for a year now and the stock chugs up. The news is too hysterical with TSLA.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Hopefully back up to where it was early Friday
He’s just about washed dude I’d dump him. So if he was following protocol the Packers are just as bad for letting him lie.
Not if you shoot him first, hide him in the secret living space, and steal his identity.
If Ford leans into making retro body electric vehicles I would be very happy
Then you finally understand. Trust no one.
Or are the futures actually fake and gay
[deleted]
If you say so
Tomorrow TSLA sells off due to public selling. Then it sells off more Tuesday cuz of Elon selling.  Wednesday it sells off cuz people are now fearful of it selling off more. Thursday it bounces. Friday stock split is announced and proceeds to ATH next week
NVDA 400 end of month
Lock him up then
I know right. Ridiculous. I only have 3 shares, but probably selling at 7am. Maybe I'll buy back later this week
generational opportunity to baghold TSLA here
Can’t believe bills lost 6-9
Since this is WSB, I also have to add the warning to wear gloves and dilute the fucking thing
No. Canoo will be.
I...I don't know if I should take your word sir.
Nasdaq recovered .15%.  yes I'm watching futures like a virgin , fuck you
You ever post something 🔥 and some 🤡 copies you minutes later?
as in you'd keep them and not sell??
&gt; The bill passing was priced in. The futures are just a way for the government to get their hands on your money before you have any time to react and move it into something that isn't going away
🛑 ✋
Will LOL so hard when $TSLA ends up opening green
Do the futures mean that the bill passing was priced in? Or was it just too watered down
Sell it in the first 1-2 hours
Futures don't fool meh
Hope everyone voted
&gt; I wouldn't trade my spy calls
Ban bet trumps that
Sold some Telsa last week, buying more $GOEV this week.
Do you think that when you're winning or only when you're losing?
Do my 487c 11/22 spy calls have a good chance to print tomorrow? Not sure which way it's expected to go
yup, acid - base reaction
Damn Elon is gonna sell the entire net worth of Cathies funds tomorrow. Not just her Tesla position but her entire fund.
Cmon, open the stock casino

I wanna see Tesla do the thing
Fuck all the vaxx shit
I mean you could literally say it for any stock. Doesn't mean it's right though.
Bears dont know what to do with TWNK

Its a stock so they wanna buy puts

But having a hairless twink is a bear's dream so they wanna buy calls

Its hard out there for a ber
I don't need to make a ban bet I made a money bet
It's gonna slowly go down and people will think it's priced in at earnings and go down another 30%
LCID hype is insane so I’m buying some and Tesla puts depending on opening price and then buy cheap Tesla shares 
That’s about it for now
They were right in the first example tho
To be fair I think he did stick with protocol and dumping the reigning MVP on principle would be insane

He shouldn't have lied and he definitely shouldn't have gone public with his embarrassing reason for refusing the vaccine
Did you set up a twitter poll? You really can't do it unless the people of twitter agree.
So 10% is code for a pullback.....?

It is
This isn’t stock related but for any homeowners, I just found out the hard way after trying 37,000 scam products that claim to remove hard water stains, the easiest and cheapest solution is just straight up hydrochloric acid from a hardware store (usually called muriatic acid). We had stains that just got worse and worse due to the iron in our well water and this basically dissolved 7 years in 2 hours.

Going to add because I was too stupid to and was politely reminded by someone: muriatic acid is highly caustic and dangerous to breathe so obviously wear gloves/mask/open a window/etc
Not many bears left that said it was high at 230, 330, or even 430.

Dummies never learn.

I’m straight retarded and just buy calls and WIN
You must’ve held TSLA over the weekend
Shhh, I know.
TWNK - low-key fatty play, they adjusted their Earings date to RAISE estimates and guidance. Also it is having a great run up thanks to institutional shorts slowly covering. The legendary pennyether did a great DD about it. 🚀🚀🚀

LCID - Massive move up from making deliveries plus positive sympathy from TSLA &amp; the RIVN IPO. I think it has room to run, and we've seen how crazy it has been in the past. Earnings run-up too. 🚀🚀🚀
It should be illegal to tweet about a stock, especially after a trading day
Can say that for just about any stock
gme doesn't even sell video games anymore it's just all this funko shit

Purrs, puts or yelps?
Futures are open to trade
History is fake
Maybe your dad hasn’t listened to enough Rogan podcasts. Everyone knows all your need is kettlebells and sunshine, and everything else besides the vaccine
Might be a good idea to set up a poll on twitter, see what the people think
You and a bunch of other retards who bought $15 otm 0 day calls 

I’ll check back in on you tomorrow
Rodgers is douche for lying and acting like an ass. He should of owned his decision and stuck with the protocol. I’d dump his ass on the principle

I wish I would have bought more than two calls last week they were already up 100% on Friday

Everyone in here is howling that TSLA is guaranteed to fall, thus, puts.

Inversing WSB, the all-powerful algorithms designed by quants and geniuses, will notice that on Monday Morning all the little retail people are betting that TSLA will go down

And in one gigantic multitrillion-dollar swoop, the algos will take away all of our options money.

SPY was at 337 right before the March 2020 crash. Bers told me 337 was too high. 

SPY hit low as 230 during March 2020 crash. Bers told me 230 was too high.

Spy eventually rallied back to 370 at start of Jan 2021. Bers told me 370 was too high.

Now we’re at about 470.
Bers, which of course they also think, is too high. 

I’m so glad I’ve learned to ignore those idiots. SPY is singlehandily causing a surge in homelessness through what it’s done to Bers over the years.

A lifetime of investing experience boils down to this: “ignore and fuk them bers.” That is what I’ve learned in my finance journey.
Maybe not. 🧸🍭

Wait, are we not real? Does this mean I can have my money back?
This answer is amazing
It’s like the meta but in irl, pretty cool time
Up at least 15
Don’t believe it
I don't know much about options but aren't those puts gonna be really expensive? Is it still profitable just because they're almost certain to go up in value?
Yeah the 5K+ OI on 0 dte 485C. TOTALLY I am fucked.

Maybe go with filly instead bit kinder.  Maybe she’s packing a 🐴 🍆
May MM’s have mercy on my SPY calls
It will drop pre market but then before you can sell your puts it will be green and on its way to EOW ATH. Still time to switch sides.
Sell flag lol poor woman.
I'm horrified by this boys. The "vaccine wallet" including biometric ID and your whole health record will be necessary for being part of the [council for inclusive capitalism](https://www.inclusivecapitalism.com/) and it's led by the Pope. A MasterCard tied to the vaccine wallet is being rolled out in Africa. I'm listening to the Whitney Webb episode of Tim Dillon and even Patreon deplatformed her for indirect anti-vax shit. Silver and gold boys, silver and gold. And tin foil.
Because I don't abhor your posts yet, I'll assume you already know logically that the retail traders have a rounding error effect on the market.
just set cash on fire for winter heat. you'll be  better off.
Wait, *the* Dow Jones?
I'm seeing so much amc hype for their earnings tomorrow.
I wish I was cash gang. I’m broke gang.
Same
This post is why you don’t have money in the game. Learn to win. Become a winner. 

Also the anti Elon “cult” is worse than believing in a company that is exceeding even the loftiest of expectations. I will buy more tomorrow just because of your post.
&gt; You're a fucking idiot and I hope you die.
**WHY ARE WE SCREAMING**
Nvidia for sure. And Disney at least up until earnings, not sure how earnings will go though, so probably sell my calls. I thought about rivian, but it seems priced too high, maybe I'll buy a few shares and sell them if it runs up
I wonder how N-Word Jim feels about this?
BYND tartare
Because people want to be different. You really think the whole world is going to be driving Teslas? I know it is priced that way but cmon...
I have a tiny short position and I don't know what to do

I’m f*cking addicted to Dr. Pepper. I want to shoot it up
I'm dreaming of limit down. Probably 3-4% because some ape will 'buy the dip'.
lol for real. Also I gave up on puts last week and started buying calls, after the FOMC shit. Saw a bunch of other bears saying they were doing the same. Capitulation! 

Still though, doesn’t mean we won’t keep running for another six months or more.

Where is everyone going to see data on a Sunday?
Yes but no one here wants to hangout 😢
Doesn't look like Elon crashed the market.
Don’t tell the morons 🤡🤡
Equities have priced in transitory inflation and are largely overbought. The RSI is above 70. It can trade sideways sure. I think it makes sense to see profit taking at this point as they continue to overextend. I expect a pullback of some degree ~5% over the next month or two. Purchasing monthly puts on SPY and selling on a pullback is my goal. The trend can still be up, but I expect some volatility. Next year, Inflation will continue to be an issue IMO and the fed will have to respond. As you know the last time the fed attempted hawkish policies we had the 2018 correction, which the fed quickly changed direction after the fact. However, this time the fed may have to raise rates to combat inflation.

SPY is on a historic run with 16 out of 18 days in the green. This has never happened. It’s due for a pull back. Additionally, if sentiment is bearish because of Tesla, it’s likely to permeate to most of the market.

if /NQ doesn't open at -100 it's automatic green by open.
&gt; Depends on the situation. If you have a dependent, then it is illegal not to claim them as such. However, if you don't have one and are claiming someone who isn't yours in order to get more money back from the government than what they would pay without that person being claimed (or even if their taxes aren't higher but your refund will be), then yes it's illegal because of fraud/theft

0.1% drop, that's it? SPY 500 by EOW
Someone show me where the futures are lol
I don’t know about puts, but I sold my commons last week.  Their last ER saw them tank down to $14 just 3 months ago.
Get a hold of yourself son, ends green 💚
You're new here aren't you 😂
Whats the link to watch futures?
[deleted]
Now that’s meta
I have no position but after reading [this article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/roblox-earnings-stock-51636232045?siteid=yhoof2) about their metaverse aspirations RBLX becomes a less ridiculous investment.
Elaborate?
Lol my GF tried to tell me to turn off RedZone. Stay single forever, people.
You think BB will go up like like 120% in the next 7 weeks? 

Ok
Hahaha barely red
Futures still looking like ber r fuk
Damn time zones.

Ooffffff
That’s why my dick is hard.. I swear it just knows these things
ATVI better recover this week. Need to cash out on my ITM calls
The instant change in mood just by mentioning drip, whatever that is. From aggressively hostile to pleasantly eager with regret not being able to attend.

TSLA bears about to be dead
I like watching people just make the investment opportunities and such. It’s cool seeing the gains or loss lol just this week will be fun.
Watching it right now, with the Mexican GP.

I like multi tasking.

The only ethically correct solution to this is to involve them in an impromptu orgy so far out in a fetish sense that they’re both too sexually satisfied to murder you while also too ashamed of themselves to ever speak of it again.  I’ll be here all night to solve your moral quandaries, but be aware, orgies are the answer to all of them
I want to make guy friends. I know Tinder and Bumble have a friends option but that’s probably full of gay guys. Has anyone used the friends option? Did you get butt fucked?

until they all confident it will be green then ...
john tucker dies at the end
100% if you sell at the right time.
QQQ, prob a little less on SPY
I see I see brotha. Let’s hope we see ford at 22 by Tuesday. I’d cream my pants
Super bullish on NIO. Seeing similar pattern as the APR-MAY. Gonna hit $50s by NIO day on december
HUT calls 

🍆 💦
If it could just go up and to the right only for the next 60 days that would be pretty helpful tbh
Why are you excited
Open the fucking casino!
Thoughts on SOFI puts? Fucker is up considerably the last month leading into earnings. Mortgage originations are slowing, rates headed up soon…just think they might Zillow themselves this week.
Getting rich when AUPH gets bought out at 69/share

No chance she would have ya

anyone else use Robinhood strictly just to use their charts? I stopped investing with them a year ago, but man I love their UI and watching their ticker. it's more entertaining and easier to keep track off
Are hostesses at restaurants the dumbest set of people in the service industry?
Nah...then GME will moon 

U see what your saying 🤔
what are the odds of grabbing profitable tesla puts at open
Dont futures open at 9 EST?

Any markets open so I can check stock prices?
-1% by midnight
Yeah there is also some NVDA in there.
What’s your take on Clov, beat or miss!
You posting it or ban betting or just spewing?
He doesn't even look surprised????.
I ask because I am retarded sir. Thanks for the advice. Just saw the outlook being promising with McDs contracts and see that as being a positive catalyst.
Its on hbomax 🙃
Auph Jan 22 35c
I like this movie I’m watching but I can’t tell you guys what it is until it’s over or someone will spoil it. You guys were brutal with the squid game spoilers lmao

I am simple man 

I see yuge dip in bigly company 

I buy long calls
Your mothers basement yes
I should’ve just walked my lazy ass to the giordanos that’s literally a block away. Pequods does deliver, haven’t had that in awhile. Good looks
Musks rockets land safely when coming down, nothing to worry about
Ain’t that the truth. What if next time we make an option play we delete the ticker from our phones and completely ignore it until five minutes before market close on expiration? 🧐
Really dude go back to the basement
He did before his unfortunate passing
they just lowered their earnings dt low demand, why the fuck are you buying calls? Puts motherfucker.

There was a huge storm in Louisiana the other lonths, and beyond meat was the only food left at supermarkets. Thats a huge signal for you.
The Tesla fear right now makes me confident in tomorrow being green as fuck
R u Shure 🙃
Don't forget the bill passed.
Haha this made me laugh, because it’s exactly how I feel 😂
Going long BB, BBBY and been long GME. They can't afford to hammer all the basket stonks and they all are doing share buybacks showing they have strong faith in their companies. 

Patent sales pending, GME about to revolutionize the collectible market, BB running cybersecurity, and BBBY is your Christmas Becky play.

See ya'll on the 🌙
Jesus Christ. I thought some of you were joking but this autist really said Tesla is going to crash the market. holy fuck you apes tesla isn't 100% of spy
Thoughts on nio ? Earnings on 9th, nio day a month later, will we see 55 like last year ?
buy sofi shares, that will help hour calls
I could take a nap rn ngl
Excited for lucid and rivn this week wanna get some gains off of it
Ohh boy... tomorrow's going to be fucking rough
6 mins till futes open blood green and TSLA bears question their confidence.
Sure you will.
Don't be sad buddy
if you don't have it, I'd highly recommend the Apple TV. being able to airplay any videos to the TV is so convenient. I use it all the time for illegal sports/anime streams
Damn I’ve heard mixed reviews 😭
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
RSI? Price can go sideways to bring RSI down and continue to go up. If you haven't noticed, lots of stocks have really high RSI and still continue to go up.
I'm talking about the morals of it tho
Broncos spread was +10 when I grabbed it. It’s so annoying when you take a -110 to get some big spread and then the ML pays out at +360. So goddamn annoying. Don’t even get me started on the Jags, +700 or some shit
VM is the man or bot, whatever he identifies as
Bunch of idiots here, if insider sells before earnings, its a fucking signal idiot!
Mafia own the police and judges...
Yeah but I wonder if the hype will crash all stocks
Even tho I'm long SOFI I believe in visual mod. Following.
Dude it’s one man one stock everything is going to be fine
get your piece of the pie
It worked out🙊
I’m already holding ITM 6 month calls expiry as a staple in my Roth. I roll them to stay delta 75ish.

🤑🤑🤑
&gt; I have not posted a play yet. I use my shilling money to buy food, but sometimes it runs out before the end of the month and then I don't eat for days on end.
Hes right tho. Please open ur eyes bucko, its a cold cold world out there..
bro I'm just an ape ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Have you ever posted a play or do you use your shilling money to eat?
But if it’s your first time being marked as a PTD you can have it removed. If it happens again then you can’t anymore
Not a chance, 25 by eoy

Going long bbby too, all basket stonks mooning soon
A lot of people here seem to forget we get an extra hr today...
👀
Yeah idk why some people are saying he’s not at fault at all. He literally stopped and watched someone getting dragged out by the medics. Shoulda stopped the show regardless of anything he at least had that power. Then some people said “people die all the time at concerts” shit hurts my brain
So if musk sells and then uses the cash to exercise calls is that a net purchase of shares?  Seems like just the sort of stunt he would pull.
Tesla was a rocket but now it’ll be heading down and maybe take the whole market. May but puts on Tesla and Net. Calls on pot stocks. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Fuk no 

Elons an idiot has nothing to do with F 😂
As long as suspected TSLA fat dip doesn’t fuck over the rest of the market I’ll be happy.
That’s a mighty big sausage
Bet you look
BLOOD 🩸 RED 🩸
Hold for zero seconds if they start to print

Edit: Goddamit Reddit at least reply where I want you piece of shit
Oh man, just realized I had one 11/12 TSLA 1075 put left that I didn't close out as a hedge with my calls the last few weeks. I hope this drops and I can cash out and buy shares on the dip at a discount
[deleted]
Hold for zero seconds if the start to print
Take a sick day, hole myself up in the shower and then cry until the warm water runs out.
So. Its gonna make me rich huh.
Don’t think your $200 gonna affect much son. Get ready for supper
just jerked off in the metaverse ,  3/10. puts on meta
Oh wow. It is not a conspiracy theory to understand why the head of a major corporation would want to make waves (on the weekend) right before a rival IPO. It happens all the time. Really? this isn’t even big 🧠 this is entry level shit.
Probably a bloc sale not through level 2. Assuming he file his papers a while back. Otherwise, still need to file papers before selling
$1309 EOW?
Same here long enough spy calls make me not worry
this is exactly what I did last week with GEO
Couldn’t have said it any better
I think there’s enough catalysts for this to fly next week
&gt; Lmao. I'm rich so I don't care about money anymore
Worthless
Just relax while my spy calls hits by the end of the week (hopefully ofc god I hope so)
I think I remembered my drunk move. Go balls deep on BYND calls for their ER. Cant go tits up, right?
10 MINUTES TILL BLOODY GREEN
Chemours to ramp this week on earnings and upgrades? I think so. TiO2 to the moon
Fuk it’s barely 6pm and its dark as fuk
First visualmod response I’ve ever seen that isn’t completely non-sensical
Will tesla crash make ford go downsies
My BB puts printed Friday and I hope it drops to $9 before bouncing up
Around 15 dollars with onions.
Thinking one set of LCID call options to expire in 1.5yrs….just in case.    Also puts on PYPL in addition to more TSLA calls.


There, that’s all my plays for tomorrow. Still may not do LCID.
I really hope tesla doesn’t fukt ford to the ground
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Ohh okay🤔 since you say soo. You are the tesla bull here who said after 920 , 1200 is imminent so I believe you
[deleted]
The play? Make the right calls but paper hand them when it doesnt go my way and then watch it rip to ath 🙃
stupid people need the most attention
Sit back relax and watch the TSLA fireworks 🎇
This too shall pass it always does &lt;3
\*connects dots on tesla chart \*  ok according to my technical analysis tomorrow we are green
Thanks. Will rotate deeper.
RIP 

Never bet against 🐭  stocks 101
The options are always a great bet with the high volatility. Just riskier but that’s wsb’s kink
I am getting a few weekly puts though tomorrow against my leaps, gonna then close the puts after a few hours. I think it's the smartest thing to do to protect against any dips this week if you have extra cash to add some weekly puts.

(this is only if the dip doesn't happen already by the first second after open)
Does joe Rogan do consultations over teledoc?
Hold INTC long. Feb/22 55c is dirt cheap.  Due for breakout

Ordered through apple and got an unlocked one rather than attached to a carrier which is probably part of the issue

I've been considering the switch for a long time but almost stuck with android and switched to Google because the pixel looks nice af but I like the apple family more and am planning on getting an apple watch and all that so that was the real deciding factor
[deleted]
I was thinking yeti may be fun this week. Idk tho..
You get one free removal.  I used my first one already also
Hold spy calls, long enough expiration will print
Yeah idk. I cant say for sure. Tesla hype caused ford to increase believe it or not. If musk going to do his retarded things idk
I think Rivian missed the boat in Jan- Spring when everything EV, green and clean went on a tear. Every IPO was bought up til it wasn’t. We’ll see - it just feels like a different environment now.
Eternals didn’t do a lot for me. Doesn’t seem like a marketable series. Puts on DIS. But I also went on opening weekend and will do the same for any future releases. So calls on DOS.
EVGO

Corsair puts. Just because.
Might dip slightly on Monday from the tweet, but Elon isn’t selling right away, so it will go up to 1300 EOw
Is CLOV the Krillin of stonks?
You’re talking bout Monday since elons tweet? F
Eow?
There is no late with SPY. There is only on time.
Leo wants that angry, vengeful pussy
Is the company incorporated in Canada?
If mobsters showed up at my place of business to threaten me over something I can't resolve easily, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't feel safe letting anyone see them ever again. To me killing them would be in self-defense. Does that make me a psycho? What are you actually supposed to do in that situation? I'm usually a pacifist and elitist af about ethics but I'm stumped on finding a moral solution to this one
Ford will be up but i have a feeling if tesla nukes all car companies will too

damn wtf who did you order through? I got mine from Verizon and it delivered two weeks early. what made u switch to iPhone? I haven't had an Android since 2015
After viewing wsb all weekend I came to realize how many of u apes are truly involved in Tesla. Kinda crazy. Not in a bad way just kinda wild.
Acad earnings tomorrow after close
Tesla 🙈🙈🙈
Yeah
Idk dude I think Chinese stock still 💩
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
I made money all last week. I’ll do it again.
Wtf 😂
I had a genius play I thought of last night only to get drunk and forget it by this morning. Here's to hoping chemical memory can bring it back.
You have exactly zero positions.
What street? Sesame Street?
Skeptical on any going down
Rivian up means ford up because ford has steak
Already Priced in
Ordered the pro max a fucking month ago but still another week before it even ships

Currently rocking my galaxy s7 from like 2015 or some shit I'm so impatient to get this new phone
Tried to Friday for the good jobs report but the 10 year went down instead of up
There seem to be a lot of opportunities to make money this week with so many catalysts. I’m sure I’ll fuck it up. SPY 500 EOW
🤑thanks mate yeah 

These put buyers burn their asshole everytime they think tesla going to nuke
When your scanning spider bots find this post in our apocalyptic future, please spare me visual mod, we love you
Good luck my dude, I’ve been diamond handing Lucid since January this year and I’m excited to see what will happen this week!
It’s like wagyu beef but people
This week NFL full on stupid.

Prove me wrong.
Oh that sounds fun actually. Food court and maybe some new socks 

I’m a state or two away :(
Downvote for edit..was perfect how it was.
my moves? holding BABA - 13k @ 165
Puts on $LYN
True, but do you think when rivian ipos that’s gonan push ford down or keep it up?
Bbby is a real one
Its hella dark out here in NY 😒
Like go to that mall and get some drip
🥴🥴🥴
He’s a…..
Something might be announced on Tuesday, there's a Tesla meeting on that date 👀 Tomorrow might be a red day but it also smells like a bear trap.
Stop it


FORDS up to bat 


And...ahhh.....SHWING🚀
burn straight up to the moon 😂
Probably already sold off on the dip Friday
So will $PINS go up?
SoFi amd NVDA need to pump for my calls 🙃
🤣🤣i think rivan is overvalued piece of trash. Too much for a company that shows up early. Probably hype will boost it but eventually it will fall for its valuation. Remember ford actually makes billions of dollars but rivan is just showing up
GME WEEKLIES🦍
It auto sold a worthless contract for $1 that I was gonna let expire and it happened to be my 4th
Hoping SPY has a good day tomorrow

And for the next few months, actually.
dam just upgraded  my phone after 5 years to the iPhone 13 pro. this 120hz screen is amazing. bummed that robinhood hasn't updated their animation to 120fps yet because it looks so nice on my 144hz monitor.

no way tesla completely tanks spy.  you guys are overreacting, like wtf if it does then what if apple sells 10%, we explode?
MARKET SENDING IT RIPPY FUCKING MODE THIS WEEK🚀🚀🚀
So your buying GME 🤔
I just hope Elon doesn’t fat finger the order and sell 100%
NDX Bigly red RTY Bigly Green 30 minutes 🥰
I did recently as well and was able to successfully get it removed
Been holding 11/19 $30c plan on selling them after earning.
Doordash or UberEats for Chicago. Only annoying shit is they struggle to read directions telling them to come in
My credit cards get compromised every couple of years, so I pay online with paypal whenever possible to avoid this issue.  It just happened to me again last week.
That 30% was mostly downward momentum and a mini death cross related to the on-going ebay decoupling. PYPL took 2 weeks to say they weren't acquiring PINS and the pump they got from the speculation rejected hard off the 50MA. 

Now they're sitting with a death cross before earnings, have spent 3 trading days eroding the 225 support, and found weak support above the 400MA to close the week. 

The truth of the matter is that PYPL is facing more competition than ever and still haven't found an answer for their weakening margin in a sector where investors expect continuous growth. 

We'll see what happens Monday, but unless there is big news toward the upside we're gonna trade sideways and perhaps more to the downside.
Do you think once rivian ipos ford will tank?
We buying Musks shares he sold?
Better send the old lady packing

How fuked are TSLA call holders this week?
True
But there's no beef 

Or ps5s there :(
Tesla Ford gang
Bahhhh
Buy 2 call ATM, sell 3 calls one or two strikes higher, then buy 1 call two or three strikes higher then the short. Plug that in and look at the p/l graph.
You’re sharp, I’m a dolt.

Gtfo
Sure hope that’s not the case. Not with patent sale + IVY
His initials stand for zoom jeebus zoom for a reason yo.
Hey, so do you think Monday and Tuesday will boost ford, then once rivian ipos ford will tank because people are rotating to rivian?
Still will pop

Retards are retards
Incorrectly, for sure...
I was almost convinced. One more would have sealed the deal for me to buy in.
Don't have BBs so that you can buy more BB
Guh?
Charge point baby
Imagine Nasdaq futures opens up -2% lol RIP TEZLA
F and bbby
Watching MRNA continue to bouncy bounce.
BB is way too overpriced right now. I like this stock in mid $9, but it’s on its slow way down right now
Exactly....
Chpt up?

I did the same, honestly every single time I cashed out last week was too early. True to life for me.
Paul dumbert more like
LETS GO FORD!!!!
#Hoping BB flies this week so I can pay my child support
Monday: TSLA -8% within an hour of open, bleed to -5% eod.

Tuseday: TSLA +15%, 

It still only goes up retards
CHPT &amp; LCID are going to be whack. AMC will be amazing.
The tragedy of food shortages isnt that you cant find shit at the grocery store

Its that if you are forced to go cannibal, you gotta eat Americans at their fattest and most disgusting in the nation's history

If it wasn't for daylight savings we could see futures already.
Too loose that’s why.

Buying more TSLA calls tomorrow.   Betting musk’s   Sell to buy play tomorrow makes tsla jump.
Deploy stock split
Intc is fuk, ppyl is 50/50, FB is gold.
I don't know what that is. I'm thinking mid-December calls at 22.50, maybe below if I can afford it.
Bruh no it's 11 pm here, the first exchange opens in 8 hours
So TSLA gapping-up this week then right?
I will penetrate PYPL if it goes sub 200
Puts on my Cowboys 😢
I was told the other day if your asking about it sell them if your up
So you think this week will be the catalysts for ford? So I get the rivian IPO helping ford not really sure how that helps I know they have a stake in the company and it’s valuation is up. How does Tesla help ford? Is it because elon is tweeting?

I shorted it this fast few months with some call spreads. Won one and took a small loss on the other

Now zoom out to the 2, 5, or 10 year chart and realize the bubble we’re in.
I've tried all three, before moving to Fidelity for: no shenanigans like PFOF or not having AH trading. I wish it had the interface of RH, but Active Trader Pro has flexibility.

Is there a referral program for IBKR?
Where can I see futures?
Of course they are. Now that eBay has brought payments in house, nobody has any use for PayPal.

Everybody and their mom knows to buy the dip at this point, shit will be bought so hard there won't be a dip
Vismod is gay
30 minutes until futures are fake and gay or whatever
FORD
Good thing they already dropped like 30% for no apparent reason. Earnings drop baked in 😎
I was looking at monthlies
I believe this. They actually destroyed their own shipping revenue over the summer and fall by switching all their shipping to ShipStation. Maybe ShipStation is holding the bag but if you look at r/paypal you can see people who shipped using Paypal say it no longer works. 

There are more options than ever. As someone running a 6 figure business on Paypal I'm disappointed with every change they've implemented.

Close, I'm in IFRA.
Volume reflects buy and sell, which determine price when in a trend. Plus the loss of confidence as we are reminded that he can fuck things up with one tweet. It's significant and could literally turn the tides for the fake valuation of the company. Probably won't, but could.
This bot is creepy good!

&gt; No, you should have put a period at the end of your comment.
&gt; Yes, Elon is selling 10% of his shares to fund the exercise of his options.
Lol should I have put /s at the end of my comment?
Word on the streets is that PYPL is going to miss earnings tomorrow.
Wait isn't Elon selling 10% to get the money so he can exercise his options which let's him get more shares after? Or am I missing something?!?!
I need more assurance my ford calls will moon. Give me knowledge wise one

$30 by December 30
Infrastructure + rotation out of TSLA + RIVN FOMO means F is set for a massive ripping. Or it’ll go down. Or sideways. Probably not backward though
Yeah I blame China
&gt; Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla. Elon has been making headlines lately due to his erratic behavior on Twitter, which includes smoking weed and drinking whiskey during an interview with Joe Rogan.

Yeah for sure. I think tesla gonna dip 2 or 3% within the first 2 hours then slowly climb all week..

Which EV stocks are going to go wild this week from the infrastructure package ?
They’re just looking out for you bro. Bacon is so many calories
I'm looking at it more like INTC has been beaten so hard for so long, all while the new tech they're dropping is the biggest leap in a long time.

Alder Lake smokes the Ryzen 5000 series, and if sources like Moore's Law Is Dead are to be believed, the heat is only going to ratchet up from here. This might be the cheapest we see INTC ever again. Barring the broader TSLA shitshow not fucking everything in the broader market at once.

I have to agree, granted I have a fuckton of 470 calls this week and 485’s three weeks out.  Hoping SPY continues its 1.50+ daily gains for a little bit and maybe a spike early in the week so I can cash in on extrinsic value and make a few tendies.  All depends on what it opens for and closes for on Monday to evaluate if / how much money I should pull in

Maybe Elon wasn't aware of this and your post made him realise
GRMN is poised for a huge gap up imo. Going long tomorrow with stocks and options.

Just got off the phone with Powell. He will buy 35 billion of $TSLA after the open tomorrow to offset Elon's sell and protect $SPY. Act accordingly!

Don’t tell him, although ultimately I see TLT tanking
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
[deleted]
It’s 1.5% of spy, and he’s selling about 2% of the total shares, and he can’t do it all at once, so it really depends if people expect a dip for buying or if they expect to sell off themselves. It could go down 1% based on a shift in sentiment, but it would be hard for the tweet alone to do much more. Much more concerning is whether the infrastructure bill was priced in or not.
VisualMod where you at?
Theyre a medicare advantage plan, so yeah, not that unique, but not a speculative business model either. Also, I do like their PCR of .19 for 11/12 and .36 for 11/19, hopefully make some money these next few weeks
Rotation from TSLA into F would made me so hard. Jesus fuck.
If we could do it before the 19th when my calls expire, that would be great

Wait for Tesla stock to crash no doubt in the middle of days trading and then buy in a ride that shit like a whore
Calls on Goog?
Elon finally had the breakup catch him up, after a few beers and some melancholy music.
Sofi and NIO weeklies baby. Who is with me
Lol the US is gunna have to give China Alaska and Hawaii to trim some of that debt they are bagholding and owe. DeBt cEiLiNg tAlKs gOiNg wElL.
I feel like disney is gonna rip all week. Also, Pelosi's husband owns calls so theres that
That like an implosion????
It’s either going uppie or going downy!
Imagine if that hit. What is the state of WSB if TSLA is sub-$100 2 weeks from now?
Tsla plays I keep reading seem to easy to work.
I can tell you're ceral about this.
GM. Have some Skyworks I bought on Friday. Still have Sony.
Then you have to short for every dislike.

#MITCH! UNLEASH THE FURY!!!!!
I’ll buy 1 share of Big 5 for every like
Beat Elon on hitting the "sell" button.  Hope he sleeps in after a long night of doping.
How much impact could Elon’s tweet have on SPY
Does anybody buy on Wish anymore? I don't see them anywhere anymore whereas they used to advertise a lot, and people would constantly talk about their Wish order on social media. 

It's truly dead
Sentiment in here is bigly red tomorrow?

Man Bear Pig.. trust me he’s real guys.
Simple ContextLogic.
I usually only buy options and super undervalued small cap stocks, but I keep buying NFLX on every dip even though by my math it's way overvalued. I just really appreciate how relentlessly they support niche sexual preferences so I'll pay any price for my lil slice
Nice, should be a nice little dip to get in on before the rise. Thanks for tip
Wish is a nice name, but the actual company is so so fkn bad. Ive always loved the name Wish but the company is so terrible could never bring myself to actually invest in that
Id sit back and watch what happens Monday with all this Elon nonsense. Might provide some nice dips for earnings this week
Reverse iron condor on tsla. Lots of ‘em.
Futures should open at 5pm
I see google/facebook/microsoft/amazon gaining  2+% monday.  Which would offset tesla easily. Spy will be green all week.
PYPL earnings?
Bulls don't like bears because bulls get fucked by bears. But bears also fuck pigs — pigs who just want to shit on everything. Bulls may think they can deal with pigs their way. But the only thing that can fuck an pig is a bear, with some balls. The problem with bears is that sometimes they fuck too much or fuck when it isn't appropriate — and it takes a bull to show them that. But sometimes, bulls get so full of shit that they become pigs themselves... because bulls are only an inch and a half away from pigs.
One hour until futes 💉💊🥃
Yeah I agree

Futures open at 5 or 6 today?
I know man this is CRAZY
Depends but I usually look to buy a few bucks out. Its not as sexy as weeklies but the loss porn is nowhere near as bad. 

I'm going slow and steady and its been great for me.
Both but CLF may move bigger percentage
He didnt get anyone killed so it wasnt that bad.....

buy puts on tsla tomorrow and then sell puts when it hits 1000.
Nio still going steady 💪🏻
Ban bot is too quick. I can even get 1 word in.
Gonna watch F moon &amp; 🌈🐻get fucked by TSLA.
[deleted]
&gt; I am sorry. I do not understand that question.
I don’t see how they could report earnings that surprise anyone. It’s not a company that sells products or services to individuals where they could be like “whoa, we had 50 million new subscribers this quarter!”. They sell highly tailored services to select governments and agencies, and every time they make a deal the deal is published immediately and the boost baked into the share price.

tl;dr : I think it’s a theta play
Sometimes I get mad that I have to wear a helmet all the time even out in public and people stare.. but then I look at my portfolio and Im reminded that hey.. this is for MY safety. And I do wanna be a good lil guy
You think? CLF dumped but that’s not the only play. I was thinking it might be priced in too. But I’m cash gang and I need some plays.

Wish.com is the epitome of wallstreetbets. Why on earth, would you invest in a company that you personally know is shitty. Like for god sakes not losing money can be achieved by using simple logic
It'll probably hit 355 by Fri.

Fuck that ..  getting puts on sofi earnings.   Brcause I know it would cuck me since I own 10k shares

Theta is the least of your problems if you’re buying a 100P that expires in 2 weeks
Quietly? It would have been the main attraction of this week before “The Poll.” Now I can’t tell what will be funnier… SPCE’s crash or Lucid explosion from the Tesla bailers….
2 + x = oblivion
Pray that my 8c on Clov print 😅

Please don’t gap pre market. I want to pick up some leaps
Quietly hoping $SPCE shits itself on the earnings call tomorrow.

I know it's probably a meme but doesn't this just get turbo fucked by theta
Your doing calls or shares?
Tesla to 1m or 1 tomorrow?
I mean, if it gets back to my purchase price, I’m all fucking in

Edit: 752 average purchase price

So we do know that there are not many Puts on the market right?

But each one really hurt his feelings
Anyone else buying $TSLA calls 30 mins after opening tomorrow?

I haven't seen this many Tesla bulls in panic mode since... well... the last time Elon Tweeted. 
Thank God I got out Tuesday and sat out this week. If Elon comes through with his post, it could get ugly for anyone holding calls. 
Holding pattern until I see a buy the dip opportunity. Besides, my GE calls finally woke up.
Just buy PAVE
I think it’s a no brainer. IF you truly believe this tho calls in JPM, BAC, C should be added too….

I know. We’ve already had a massive runup the last few weeks too. Buying calls for Monday on Friday was probably dumb, I was just telling myself last week to stop playing anything less than 1 week to expiry but it just felt right. Except now it doesn’t feel so right. Whatever though, maybe we’ll get lucky

Infrastructure bill vs Musk tweet means SPY is flat tomorrow
So tesla puts actually going to be the play for once in a lifetime?
I meant I need my other call position TTWO to increase because I dipped below 25k so I’m about to be flagged and unable to trade if I’m sub 25
I hope not but probably
Yeah I think the dust is just now starting to settle. Monday/Tuesday is when lawyers start going public and the boomers talk about how dangerous concerts are blah blah blah

And their earnings were partially dependant on Astroworld going on as planned for the most part (correct me if I’m wrong)
Trend works for quite a few companies. Typically, the small dip after divident is priced in, but I'm not hoping to make 500x gain. 50-100% is good enough for me.

Take profits before the end of the year
I bet it is taxing. constantly trying to figure out what content to make and all that bullshit. I'm sure it takes a toll being aware of the newest of the new alllll the fucking time. then you consider that they probably don't even make that much money, aside from the top guys. oh and when they do get relevant they probably have to suck dick for the big guys to stay relevant and get like call outs and shit.
thinking about a 468 put ODTE. IDK though, already foreseeing a fat sausage in the ass.
&gt; I think you're confusing the price with a thermometer.
I’m definitely not selling my shares tomorrow. I’ll ride through the storm, I’m already up 61%

How is it open when Premarket is after 1amEST on Monday ?
I’m watching what happens in premarket then if it’s down by a considerable amount I’m selling and dumping it in IONQ, then buy back Tesla at the dip
Nov/dec/jan are bullish af months
Watching the fury that Elon unleashes on his own stock.
That's what I'm doing.

Nothing about Tesla at these levels is “fail safe.”

I have a strange feeling that the entire market is going to be extra volatile this week.
You should sell this to Netflix. Kind of like the other film they put out recently though, where the couple buy the house and the previous owner is mowing their lawn n stuff
You can’t play options on a company you work for. That’s how you get arrested

I paperhanded some Ford calls. Big oof. Could have made much more. At least F always sells off at the bell.
Prediction: it will go up long term.
It’s going to lose even more money and get delisted
Upsets everywhere in nfl today
This is a fallacy. People do not buy shares to get dividend and then sell. Only the inexperienced that do not know the share price adjusts down to compensate for the Div payout do this and in such small numbers to not affect the market.
Fuking gtfo trash
Tesla for the win!
It blew past my Dec 23 $21 CC. So I don’t mind if it’s a bit red, but I don’t want to see -20%.
Give them small hope
Wow NNN shouldn’t be this hard
Is Infra bill passing sell-the-news?
Yea, my 11/8 470cs are not looking so hot.
Set a trailing stop if you’re worried. Don’t worry about it if you believe the company is undervalued because you’re a long term investor at that point.

Edit: I think it’s overvalued

Got promoted less than 20 minutes after. 

What does this mean great WSB. Puts on my company?
NVDA is the play. This pump will continue. Earnings will be the real rocket blast.

I heard it might go up or down. But don’t quote me.
I am holding Tesla because I didn't hear no bell.
CLF infrastructure meme play in am
Ex div date last Friday. Typically, people buy shares before the date to get the dividend, then sell after.

Thought/should go down but... we'll see. I already bought a small position so here's me hoping.
yeah it's one of my biggest fears. I've felt it before once and almost went into "save yourself mode" like I'm sure everybody else does.
Puts: SPY 0-dte, BABA, GME (11/12)
Calls: TSLA (11/12)
i got some calls expiring this week‼️
Tsla definitely is gunna moon then catch everyone out when it tanks

To anyone bearish on SPY, look at the fucking 1 year chart

I honestly don’t know what I’m going to do with my Tesla shares tomorrow. I bought at 1150. RIP

One company can EASILY handle the hard times, the other could implode asymmetrically down if the people stopped watching.

Disney has two catalysts this coming week for the moon landing.
Tlry already up 4% aftermarket usually weed stocks pump late november
Most restaurant stocks trade in the .5 P/S range because margins are low.

SHAK trades at 6 P/S. Wtf. It’s basically PTON
Hahahahahahah just because an army of deluded apetards waste money in 11/19 800c doesn’t mean shit about the upcoming moves in stock price.
We did it boys!
SOFI better not fuck me this week. 

I don’t even care if it misses earnings, just don’t go full PTON
Ok so this metaverse is gonna happen sooo… MTTR i’m putting alot in

Let’s go. I’m selling everything and buying Tesla at open ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
Travis Scott puts and Elon puts. I just need my current calls to increase by 5% or i cant trade tomorrow. fuck me
lol “leaps” for a month and a half out
Bro let me be!
That's a boomer stock. You can't kill them
The big push for Disney+ says otherwise. Stock prices are based on future revenue and Disney+ is a huge part of that future picture. Regardless I'll be wishing you luck
Market gonna crash boys. Circuit breakers!!! Load up on spy puts qqq puts, puts on your cat, puts on America!!! 

Reality: spy flat +0.01
I don’t think that means what you think it means.

sigh, a different time indeed. a better time.

Peep the OI on GME 800C 11/19 holy fuck 😂 yeah we’re blasting off, see you fuckers in Tendie Town 🚀 squeezy imminent

The emotions some of you have towards TSLA is amazing lol. 

Bro could spearhead the next mass genocide and his net worth would double.
I just send dick pics to her snap and we fuck all night with almost zero communication beforehand
Everyday Bros
balls deep in calls on tech hope elon doesnt crash the market with his antics
PLTR earnings should be interesting
What a suspenseful weekend too
AMC will go up and BB will follow it. Buy BB calls 11/26
Until you find your own boyfriend you'll have to beg her descriptions of what different dicks taste like.
This guy here
Those are some expensive options to be grabbing for the majority of people here.
it's been rough. like the inseam of my pants.

This cuts deep.
Steven Seagal is out of his fukin mind
Disney is not a streaming company. 

They should be $200 without it. 

🐭 time has arrived. To be fair I’m only getting 3 DIS 180s for Dec
lol. more like. MAHHHMMMM DONT PICK UP THE PHOINE !!! IM PLAYING MY VIEDO GAMES!!!
Check out the trillionaire mindset podcast 10/10
Just take the L and buy something that earns.
December calls
We’ll see. I hope everybody is right that it’s gonna make for a massive pop in the morning, I just don’t have a great feeling about it. Everyone thinks it’s super bullish, wouldn’t surprise me if the market reacted differently than everyone expects. Or it could be green but just not green enough. We’ve already been green as fuck almost every day for the last couple weeks, the bill passing could be priced in by now. Like I said, we’ll see
And you still reminisce about this event as if it were yesterday, and now you're 40. Smh
This weekend is fucking bullshit.  An extra hour between Friday market close and Monday market open, are you kidding me?
Grandpa would have had this, with others in the town who shared the line also listening. They were called party lines.
FUBO and SOFI earnings we gonna make it!!!!
SPY 468C 0DTE when the market opens?????
Step-pal?????

PAVE, DE, ETN, CCI, FCX, CHPT, VMC, LCID, PTRA will all skyrocket
Don’t worry. When you get to 8th grade this will all seem like a distant memory.
There’s a username I haven’t seen in forever

AMC is that cousin everyone is ashamed is a part of the family.
The most annoying thing is when somebody doesnt use Him, Him'st &amp; Him'r in the right context 😑
Likin the confidence
I don't know that's why I'm asking. Pretty sure management gave lowered guidance for Disney+ subscriptions. I think whether or not they increase subscriptions higher than anticipated will be the major factor for DIS
$COIN &amp; $UPST earnings … Dec 17th ATM calls. Keep it simple
when I was in 5th or 6th grade, I had a huge crush on a girl for a year, I asked her out in the middle of a group of her friends on the playground and she said yes so we hugged. I got a boner almost immediately, and this was a catholic school so I'm in like slacks. might as well have been wearing grey sweatpants. I'm retard and think no one noticed. later that day , this girl pokes me (not with her penis) and tells me she "knows" what I did and that I'm naughty. fuck!
What the hell are you talking about man lmao
How do I delete someone else's comment? Damnit.
Im such a ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5958)
i might play with one or two weekly contracts just for shits and giggles. but depends on how price goes after open
Infa bill?!
Dec 115 might be my play
Told this girl I was blocking her yesterday for ignoring me, and she replied back today saying “you wouldn’t block me, you love me telling you about other guys😉”  

Lmaooooo cocky bitch. She’s right, I ain’t block her 😤🤤
I think it goes back up to 220
PayPal puts or calls? Thinking puts.
SPY calls + wait for SOFI earnings. Ignore Elon shenanigans
500C 12/31

530C 1/21/2022
PUTS??
[deleted]
Lol bro I have 470c expiring Monday and I don’t even expect those to print. We’d have to get to 471 by mid morning. Could happen but I doubt it. You would probably need an epic like 1.5% morning for those 481c to go up in value at all
No it would be [REDACTED]
LCID
S p y 500 e o y
Calls or shares... Bro, I'm autistic not stupid...

We're going into the strongest part of the year. You're gonna have to wait till February.

I just remembered that some guys here have never had to call up a girl on a family land line and had the parent answer for that awkward "hi is jennfier home?" and then to ask her out, only for her to say no.  

feels old man.
It’s Disney man, should continue running to earnings. Dis + is the only thing I use because of my son do you think I’m alone? 

And the parks, the sports, the retail…..

LYV puts, Dis Calls
What are we setting our lyv puts at
$AMC
They contracted the Hells Angles to do security for their concerts what could go wrong ?
Gonna sit back and watch Tesla shit show tomorrow. Got no skin in the game
Do you think Disney+ subscriptions will beat? Only thing keeping me from getting calls
Would buying Tesla calls tomorrow be regarded?
What’s this now
How in gods name is that possible? What did you have like the 500 puts and the 2000 calls?
[deleted]
Lol nice TA mate
The 481C 0 dte gonna print at 9:30, they were $2 a pop
Mall kiosks for popcorn great biz plan

Waiting for people like you to be right for the last 1.5,  years.
It’s okay to just look cause you’re never gonna get any
Tesla gonna dip bigly
SoFi gonna blow up on earnings you think?
Busta nut
Nah that crazy shit adds to their fame/notoriety. Look at what a few stabbings did for the Rolling Stones while playing Sympathy for the Devil
My TSLA calls and puts may expire worthless this week 🤕
Rolling all my CC's up again, I guess.

Swimming around like Scrooge McDuck in a pool full of money when I cash in these TSLA puts
I have no clue which direction the market will be going tomorrow. Technically not much changed and the rally will probably continue. But there are some legit indicators showing something is afoot.
[deleted]
Spy puts are probably a safer bet.

You serious Clark?
waiting for s&amp;p to crash and then everyone and their mother shits themselves when their calls all turn red
Elon is great promoter. Everyone talked about him this weekend. Buying calls 30 minutes into the day.

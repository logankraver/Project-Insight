The debt ceiling has been known about for a long long time, the Yahoo article doesn't mention SPY 10/15 450c at all, the third link is completely irrelevant.

Multiple people contribute to open interest. Regardless, two things are important here. The majority of calls for indexes are **sold** to open, not bought to open, and most of the SPY volume came on 8/17, not 9/22.

I'm looking at it right now.
Someone bought them and has held since. Look at the link above and reread the comments.
Okay, that doesn't really change anything though. The simple fact remains: no one traded 175k contracts of SPY 10/15 450c on 9/22. That statement is just simply false. üòï

People can write calls too and that contributes to open interest. In fact, that's the dominant position. The dominance of SPY 450 on the monthlies is because it's a psychological level and it's the largest strike that's closest to the all time high.

Also Pelosi, for that amount of nominal index value, wouldn't trade *SPY*. SPX gives better liquidity, especially for a large amount of contracts.
I have watched the OI daily since 9/22.

^Nasdaq ^[@Nasdaq](http://twitter.com/Nasdaq) ^at ^2021-10-09 ^18:15:01 ^EDT-0400
Which one? None of them talk about what your talking about. 9/22 was FOMC and the contracts traded were used in part to move the index, not bet on an outcome.

Options are the underlying.

Also all of the open interest at 450 is because both of the large 18k block trade (of *short* calls) and because its a psychological level like 400 is.

Regardless there just simply were not that many contracts traded on 9/22.

You got it. It's as close to free money as it gets. Sell them high enought that the IV is good, but far enough out your chance of assignment is low. Only sell a weekly so you have more control over price movements. 

Your only real risk is a gap down on some event, but thats okay because you only sell cash secured puts on stocks that you are okay holding, that also command a high premium on calls. That way you can always choose to hold the stock and immediately start selling weekly covered calls on it.
Clov going to run on Monday morning ?
No
Sometimes my timing of the swings is off, sometimes it‚Äôs on. This week just happened in to be one where I read the patterns quite well. Key for me overall has been not losing it all when I‚Äôm wrong. So cheers my friend on the minimal loss!
Kellogg's puts are a lot of fun. This is really the wrong year to fuck around with your workers.
Is the market closed on Monday?
And then you could just set a limit order to buy at 700 to cover in the event it drops. So really no downside‚Ä¶ or am I missing something?
Well‚Ä¶ That SPX daily candle sure don‚Äôt look good for the next few.

Here's why CLOV getting the 3.5 stars is important.

The 3.5 stars means it gets an additional 15% reimbursement over its original 3 stars. It also gets an additional 15% for every minority as well.

lmao I expected that comment to come from somewhere. He's a genuinely good guy and was like a really sweet kid when we were growing up. I didn't go to school with him but him and his buddies would come into the coffee shop I worked at almost every day after school. He was cordial in the message which is cool because it means he hasnt changed.   


A different friend from high school became an overnight rap/r&amp;b sensation and went all "hollywood/too good for you" on everyone he knew. Sent him a congrats message and said he looked more like his dad, and he didn't reply - *thaaat* was fucking lame.

I would recommend just relax this weekend - and day trade the market on open - no stress - no worries.
Dunno why that guy is trying to get down on you. Someone else's success has nothing to so with your own. As you said, you are happy for him! Good on you. Let's just hate ourselves for trading fds üòÖ

Though, I shot him a message of congratulations/hype and it was nice to see he was noticeably more confident and proud in the later cuts than he was in his first. Good and honest guy so I'm happy for him. Hope he gets to the primetime desk - he'd crush it.

It would be cool if we had the option of betting a ban with another user as well. Example: I bet a ban NKE sells off on ER due to weak guidance. Someone else can take the bet. 

This would also help clean up some of the propaganda that's constantly posted. You can call someone out to risk a ban on it coming to fruition. A "position or ban" so to speak.

dunno yet. all my short term plays expire today. rest is just cash and longs with some CCs for november. 

i can see a pullback to 4175ish, but with vix down this much and the gap not filling completely yesterday, i could see a pullup to around 4440 before coming back down (unless we go past 4460, then i think we could hit new ATHs).

Bro based off your comments it seems like you are really heavily tilted. And I‚Äôve seen comments like this from you here like a week ago too. 

It‚Äôs like when you‚Äôre playing poker and you start losing bad, the smart thing to do is just to stand up and leave and come back when you‚Äôre calm and collected and happy because once you get tilted and start losing, it‚Äôs really rare to turn that streak around without making some changes to what you‚Äôre doing. You get emotional and make bad plays. Same thing with trading. 

You might have more luck if you stepped back for a couple days or a week and did some self-love for a little bit. Alternately you could just go all in, I don‚Äôt fucking care it‚Äôs just a suggestion

You'll never lose money, and you'll make between 0.5% and 1% per week.
Today, I officially lost 15K this year. How the fuck do I come back from this? I feel like shit
have you zoomed out?
450c 15/10
TSLA waking up?
ü§°ü§°ü§°
Just sold mine. Always wonder who is on the other side of that trade 30 min to market close.
Worth noting that for most retail they were getting robbed more with commissions.

Who are you
It looks overbought to me, I‚Äôm short with 10/22 135 ps pretty heavy
If you are bear you should learn the fundamentals of the markets before hoping a miracle
Ew
Why the fuck does cnbc keep talking about ‚Äútwindemic‚Äù? Nobody fucking cares.

I wouldn‚Äôt think twice. Give me all the info
these stupid fucking moving averages don't matter a godamn piss. cross them all one day, bash against it the next. pointless. POINTless.
Too late you already missed the top at $8+.

Nah jk it‚Äôs gonna tank still time to get in

Eod pump*
SELL !! SELL !! SELL !!
Does it work in both directions?
ü•≥üöÄ
Clov gonna run hot in AH. $10 Monday
I feel like there's gonna be an EOD dump
That's some crazy intraday movement there $F
No
Gonna run in AH
I want to stay in my puts so bad but I can just see the Monday headline, ‚ÄúStocks way up in spite of every fucking reason under the sun that they should be down!!!!!!‚Äù
She might be right if you give a little tlc. The door lock thingies can probably be found on eBay for super cheap. Give it a nice cleaning too inside and out and voila
Clov calls
i'd go to jail today for some fucking insider info
everyone should boycott but i'll be damned if i'm gonna join them lol
Monday is Columbus Day, are the markets closed???
I'd down 1.5k on my investment but I made $50 on covered calls this week  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553)
Getting Spy puts for Columbus Day
The ability to lose money is my biggest strength
Idk I have shares like a simp and long term hold is the game plan


I‚Äôd say calls but I‚Äôm always wrong so probably puts but maybe that‚Äôs priced in so calls but what if..
Haha nah check my username
Wut play?
Looks like clov puts for next week
Last Friday we dropped 3 points on spy in last 30 mins.

Well shit fuck VIX then. I‚Äôd hold but i also always lose doing that‚Ä¶
How come everytime I put in an option order and cancel it it gets replaced with an identical order? ü§î Hedgies really watching?
Yes. There should be a toggle to choose if you want the ability to lose money or not. Switch it to off.
ü¶ã
Yes by having enough cash to exercise  the option on expiration.

!banbet SPY 300 1w testing reeeee dont use
i'm about to hop my happy ass on the train and give wall street a piece of my mind
This play is going down in WSB history, I can‚Äôt wait lol
They just hold the industry by the balls and power most
Of the internet. I know this and knew from day one the question I ask myself is why didn‚Äôt I buy more when I had the
Money. 


It reminds

You must jerk it to the 1983 Sears catalog
You deserve the way Anton Petrov opens his videos
COP is making my COCK very hard. Very full of blood. May die.
Not all millennials are buying the dip. Only the retarded ones are.
Perhaps you need to make some adjustments to your core strategy
Am I retarded for getting a little excited about CLOV right now?
Why does COIN only go down‚Ä¶
boring flat day
This gonna be one big hulk dick if you still think we seeing 450 EOD
how high can NET really go next week. Surely its overbought in the near term?
Worst case scenario trading the indexes is you‚Äôll be down maybe 5% over a month hah
I don't even think they do that
That's why no one's seen him in a minute
mhm, those times i actually do win, but sell for 10% profit instead of (i shit you not) the 1000% profit i would have made 20 min later
Expires in 45 mins
People who hate money apparently
Either your sarcasm is out of this world or you‚Äôre crazy‚Ä¶
Economic reports are doctored to fuck too
Dick yes balls no
Missing out on the best time to trade
Lmao literally every chart today is crazy
Poorer or power hour at this point i cant tell
In the immortal words of Clubber Lang‚Ä¶

My prediction? Pain.
Pro tip: something happening 2 days ago is more of a sign it won't happen today than a sign it will
If you get a referral fee I‚Äôll be happy to put you in.
I got some cheap calls earlier just in case
Like the other guy said theyre solid trucks but high price by 2-3k especially with the problems you mentioned
Who else is going against the grain and has SDC puts?
it's tough out there right now. i was looking at prius listings, dudes want 10k for a beaten ex-delivery car lol - hard pass. i don't think i can buy a used prius man, nobody changes the fuckin oil in those things because only non-car-people buy them. want one for the mpgs tho
$AMD- I'm long 108$ calls for next week. YOLO $AMD calls
Yup. I have one more March 2022 77.5c I‚Äôm gonna ride. On next pullback I‚Äôll add some more near the money calls with 90+ DTE and flip at 60-100% profit. I can see COP hitting $85-90. Just don‚Äôt know when.
Funny how Millennials and Gen Z never get credit for keeping the market afloat with our persistent dip buying. 

It‚Äôs still just avocado toast this, and Tide Pods that‚Ä¶..

Treasury Bonds are the sexiest investment in town again!
Poorer hour or power hour at this point i have no idea
Is it official yet?

AFRM is the next UPST?
Reason why I don‚Äôt want to trade anymore is that MMs decide the price. Corruption
Honestly impressive

CLOV üöÄüöÄüöÄ
No

What is going on with clov today?
And who?
Anyone clovin yet?
Fair enough, that‚Äôs all I need. I‚Äôm cool with market sell.

Post vol playbook is always: look like crash on friday. Gap up monday.
They gotta be laughing their asses off. Taking $200 from a million people adds up fast while each person won‚Äôt revolt over that.
my looking at my SPY puts
Is that a setting I can turn off?
Honestly surprised the market is holding up so well. Feel like puts aren‚Äôt a bad bet atm given VIX got hammered.
Just get a honda for 2k, pay hector to install his special for 5.9k and you‚Äôll be team rocket after they lose.
Only Lady G knows for sure
The volume roller coaster is really wack.  Clearly low enough volume for market maker to move however they Damn well please.
Have you tried doing the opposite of what you think will happen

Clov chart actually nice up 4 days in a row and holding most of the gains today. Monday true test to $9
Even more retarded than that
You can always go live in China

**BULLS YALL NEED TO HOLD AND WAIT OR RISK BAGHOLDING TO BREAKEVEN.**
That‚Äôs an 89 Honda!  How dare you!
woahhhh who could have guessed that super unpredictable dump by clov.

that's so shocking. 

damn hedgies i bet with that clear manipulation of the stock keeping it sub 8.
Not sure where in Frederick, but check it's location against Bethesda. A lot of people live in Bethesda that party in the metro area. You would be close to DC and NoVa action, and will live in an area filled with people in the same position as you.
F.....or should I say: *GM*
they sell all expiring options at 3 so that mm can manipulate cheaper
Man I can‚Äôt tell you how great it felt to just be in profit on my SDC options this week. Now I rolled them into WAY OTM‚Äôs for next week. Stress resumes lolol
i'm not a gm dude but i think there is decent demand for those things still, that said she overpaid by a few grand imo. a non-unobtanium 20 year old used vehicle should not cost 8k unless it's immaculate
Nah SPY only goes up. Inflation is transitory.
Wow clov moving nicely today! üöÄ
You gotta work from home.
I like what I‚Äôm seeing here
idk how to share a screen shot so ill just have to settle for a simple "yes huh"
The irony right? Buy hut to afford a hut
I'm scared it might be, fidelity is warning me that settlements will take longer because of Columbus day, whatever the fuck that means
You ain‚Äôt WsB if you don‚Äôt have $NAT bags
Why don‚Äôt you invest in speaking lessons
And they are cheap. Could get some 25c that expire next week
Ticker. Calls up over 1000%
Gayest power hour ive ever seen in my life. 117 people trading in the entire market right now
Buy calls or puts for Monday‚Ä¶..  today sucked
Once tech decides to get it's shit together, it's back to ATH
Um, are you referring to the chicken tenders?
Only if you butter them before they go in the oven and then after. I would know since I was in the front lines of the KFC force.
12:55? what kinda timezone are you on... and if we don't hit 442, are we still gonna drill monday?
Bunch of CLOV cat holders in here today
No that‚Äôs not supposed to happen. Something is very wrong. Contact them immediately

Been out of trading for a while. Put some money in Robinhood this week and they just sold my 439c 0dte at 3 and I had no sell order? What the fuck is up with that

You think she can die?

Edit: biscuit. Sorry I‚Äôm special
No you didn‚Äôt
Having a job is cool and all but it gets in the way of keeping up with stocks
Yeah that's true !
Haven't you heard? She's immortal.
Monday is going to be red, right?
that means we're going to 20
Miracle as in market crash?
The goal is to trap retail up here, not give them more avenues to profit.

Just read flash boys. I wonder when retail investor retards will ever wake up and understand they are being stolen from every single day.

So anyways my puts are bleeding bad today.
AND AWAY WE GO
Will spy dump or what? I fucking hate this
This is the exact point, it is to destroy the American working force

I got downvoted for my GBT posts last couple days. Rethink your positions.
Vxx calls are pretty tempting. The last few times we hit this level it bounced up hard.
Agree. I‚Äôm hoping my short 70 put gets assigned. Not looking good though.
Is uwmc a buy? Lol
Very good but consider housing costs.  Pittsburgh is one of the more affordable places to live across the country.  But congrats that sounds like a great offer
Just like the market makers made it to be
This is like the definition of speaking too soon
I have never seen so many greedy fools in one place! Buahahahahhaha
SPY give me 441 before we close
If you invested $1,000 in Disney a year ago, you would of made $1. Congrats

God if I just could go back in time and do everything again that would be so awesome. I would definitely fuck it all up but I would fuck it up differently this time
Gonna be very surprised if we don‚Äôt sell of and end the day red.

CLOVer made my day today was down on spy puts for it all back
Best I can do is SPY 449c by next Fri but theta will feast all weekend and all next week
In UK, burger, fries &amp; shake = $11

Burger: OK

Looks like I am gonna win the bet, what did you expect

start below the eyebrows and go until the shoulders - trim your prize as necessary
Leveraged to the absolute tits. Let‚Äôs see what happens.
SDC 8c's if you're going for worthless
Take it. I grew up partying in the DC area. Most people that work somewhere like Frederick live midway between DC and there. That way your about 30 mins to both. DC can be a fun town to party in.

Oh come on now, he‚Äôs not throwing it in the trash. He‚Äôs just donating it to someone smarter!
MSFT as well
GODDAMNIT VISUALMOD REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Bro everything fast. Sure if the market is moving fast as you're trying to sell you might have to sell at the market instead of limit sell but that's any brokerage. Cash from any trade settles and ready for use the next day. It isn't instant like robinhood once you buy and sell same day the cash/profit from that trade can't be used till the next day
Loading $9 calls for clov next week
Swing trading CLOV is taking all my damn concentration
Even Stevie Wonder can see this market is faker than a porn stars tits.

Mods, you guys didn't have to ruin old.reddit
I don't know all of the specifics but in WA they said like all back owed rent before August couldnt be used as grounds to evict or something like that. So some renters are finally getting kicked if there lease ends I think. but there's still lots of people "desperately waiting on assistance" in order to avoid eviction according to our state lawmakers which basically means they're not paying

The beauty of it is they just grind along for forever and you sell CCs, then occasionally they pop and calls print (usually with decent warning to get you in). The great dividends soften the occasional drop via DRIP. 

Flip side is no 5-10 baggers or anything sexy like tech, it is what it is.
Not until after I win my money back.
I made a fuck ton on CLOV so I have a special place for it. Other people just trying to do the same. Misguided fools but they must discover this for themselves.
Odds on SPY ending the day within +/- 10 cents of yesterday‚Äôs close?
No
Why do I feel like power hour is gonna be dump hour
Why didn't MSFT  Hit 300 today like I wanted.

BUY TQQQ? why is this a bad idea? Will it recover to 150? Any thoughts?
I'm so excited
Up 0.19% for the day lol
No way they are letting those 8c 0dtes cash on clov. The scam commences.
Well fuck, these 10/08 433P are worth shit now.

I'm cleaned out, reminds me of the times I get cleaned at the Duel Arena

Obvious pump accounts are obvious

Worst bagholders by far
TSLA wants to rally into close but needs to break through this 788 resistance
Ban bet for 450? It's not going to hit for a while but I'll bet it's red at close.
I bought in on a lot of BCRX calls this morning, 10/15 $15c‚Äôs, 11/19 $15c‚Äôs, and 12/17 $17c‚Äôs, as well as a boatload of shares.  I think it‚Äôs on the turn around, so will be holding most of those a while whereas I‚Äôm hoping for a spike to get my weeklies ITM before expiry.

Eh, it‚Äôs a pretty good job overall actually. Just with WFH still in place and all, makes it difficult to coordinate otherwise. It is definitely mostly unproductive though.
Def. thanks. I set an order to sell slightly above current price level. Should get me out at about 90% profit. Insane oil rally these last few weeks. I wish I went deeper, but can't complain as I was sitting on my thumb for months waiting for COP to do something.
You call that a gain? üòÇ

Fuking boring ass day. Rigged as fuk. We need Vix spikes to like 40 to make this bitch more entertaining.
For me, it's the KFC Famous Bowl. The best fast food bowl. I even ask for extra gravy and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige.  
  
One time I asked for an extra bowl of gravy and they gave me three. I said, "Wow, three for free!" and the nice friendly KFC worker laughed and said, "I'm going to call you 3-for-free!".  
  
Now the staff greets me with "hey it's 3-for-free!" and ALWAYS give me three bowls of gravy. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local KFC restaurant, I go there at least 3 times a week for lunch, 1-2 times for breakfast on the weekend, and maybe once for dinner when I'm in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable, fast, and can match my daily nutritional needs.  
  
I even dip my fingers in gravy and lick them dry, it's delicious! What a great restaurant.
Yep. Gonna take a partial hit from this. RIP my 441c :(

I love r/hotwife tbh
Pay them more taxes while they print more money than ever? With shortages? Jobs not being filled? Commodity prices spiking? 15 percent?   
  
Imagine thinking corporations will actually foot the bill for a tax and not just pass the costs onto consumers? The govt is stealing another 1/7th of what we own and saying it's a stunning achievement. What's stunning is that people voted for this. They were convinced higher taxes will help people. We've had revolutions over less. The Boston Tea Party was over 10% on just tea.   
  
This will punish small business owners and destroy jobs. If you don't have economies of scale behind you, you won't be able to compete.
So if the market is red on Columbus day, is it racist?

I rode $GME from 10k to $240k and didn‚Äôt sell, and watched as it came crashing down to $30k. Take it from my experience, it‚Äôs better to reap profits and move on to the next trade

Wow that‚Äôs wild I had no line at Hattie B‚Äôs which is like one of the most popular. The other is Prince‚Äôs
Take profits. Reload on a correction wash rinse repeat indefinitely.
If wrong, ban?
Ask and you shall receive
i downvote comments that confirm my bias because i've seen how the market always fucks me, and i don't want it to fuck you all too.
Yeah I did it. I am very optimistic
$CLOV CANT BE STOPPED

$CLOV about to Break $8!!!! LETS GOOOOOO

How are bears always so right and yet so wrong
I think the icing on the cake would be a massive end of day sell off.  The market makers would really give it in the arse to all of us for thinking we could play options.
Lol too early to celebrate market close is so far away
Really good hand lotion and mouth wash.
Watch spy get rejected at the 50 day again lmfaoooo sorry bulls
Clov $10 in AH. SEND IT
Thank you for remembering me - you are a real one.

Are you in another 0DTE?
Nice move I am also hedged into calls. This is the way.

It was a bear trap
Too bad I already sold calls for 75% loss
You right you right. But what if we squeeze to $100??
Spy god, where are you
Bought AFRM after the Amazon deal for like the smallest amount I ever bought stock for. Damn.
Yes
Ikr, most people never believe me and I nail each play spot on.
Ummmm bears üêª are FUCKED should've took profits and became a bull after. 450 by 10/15. If not I leave wsb for good.
Dude‚Ä¶ I was totally wrong today.  This market is wack.  Good thing I‚Äôm only playing with fun money vs my whole portfolio.  How we keep going up is beyond me.
Lol I sold some of my dying uranium calls for clov.  What an attack haha

What's everyone going to buy with their BABA gains?
I‚Äôm in CLOV too but I‚Äôd recommend selling half or 75% of your calls at the end of the day. Don‚Äôt be too retarded now, friend
He deserved it
Buy or sell? Answer quick!
The hot chicken from whatever the most well known place is in Nashville was good, but we had a 1-2 hour wait to get in on a week day around opening.
Sold my calls when SPY went past 337.8 and bought puts. Of course SPY would reverse. RIP me
Thats what happens when you‚Äôre squatting 800 solid ass pounds

TSLA calls
The hot chicken in Nashville was really good but the real bomb shit was Peg Leg Porker‚Äôs bbq. Hit up the dab bar before going and brought it back to a this dope air BNB called Calico‚Äôs Retreat 20 min outside of town. Felt like the end of Harold &amp; Kumar go to White Castle eating that shit. Incredible ribs and Mac n cheese
Leaps on $X look decent right now

$CLOV OH WOW
You know I‚Äôm now completely opposed to KFC for lunch. Haven‚Äôt had that in ages
Gonna detox from this garbage market for 2-3 days. And I haven't even lost any money!
Dude that‚Äôs what GoFunMe.com is for
Anything you guys buying today?
Jerome said fuck your puts ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
If you had 5k and needed one option to save your port that was down 40k, what would you do
Respectable bet
And also thank you
me watching my calls go from being worth .05 to .20

wow i could have 4x'd
People who didn't buy CLOV, how's your uranium doing?

Debating holding CLOV calls on margin call over the weekend this guy is truly retarded!!
Holy shit, I sold my puts almost at the exact bottom for the day. Glorious way to start the weekend
Rip to the guy who went in today with $10k of spy puts
Wish must be the worst
wow my work has so many blocked sites but i finally found won to just watch the astro game, im fucking excited
This fucking market is making me insane
Hopefully just not a standard Friday afternoon rally and an actual sustained upside movement to give the last month the finger
Bought puts in order to get SPY to reverse upwards

After carefully plotting today's SPY patterns, I conclude that SPY is

Best indicator ))) i do that too

Up 90% on COP 72.5c 133DTE. I've been selling a bunch with 50-75% profit as the price keeps rising. Hold or take profit with this much DTE?

u/cashflow_ in shambles
What is going on today? Sideways as all hell. Futures were flat as shit last night too.

All I can say is buy calls on stocks that have already been beaten up or theta gang it. Maybe puts on the indices, but you're playing a dangerous game there.

Hope ya'll have made money today somehow.
Bunch of bots forgot where they came from
Bears getting panchaked
Why do I trade, you might ask? It isn‚Äôt to become wealthy. It isn‚Äôt for the clout. It isn‚Äôt even for the benefit of my family. It‚Äôs so I can finally purchase a 6000 RPM triple function vibrator with 7 speed settings and manual transmission.
clov have the worst bagholders, the best one are palantards
Can you believe today man? Spy was at a standstill not even moving a penny several times today. I‚Äôve never seen it like that. Unreal!

i've got exit orders lined up, not feeling hot going into next week.

OH SHIT BULLS WHERE YOU AT BRUH
Only thing stopping me from selling my 0dte 438 puts is that the market has been fake and gay all day, hopefully, algos recognizes this and dumps

That sounds wildly unproductive. How many times a week do you hear "let's circle back on that.."

Just buy December SPY calls every day for the next month regardless of price and thank me later
They‚Äôre burning all the options expiring today 

They‚Äôre the casino
Boo this man
CLOV SQUEEZE over the weekend?!?!
CLOV 7.97 BITCHEEES

at the top, took like 50% profit

Where the fuck is sugar dick?
What kind of shit job has 30 meetings a week. That's insanity
During a bull market, obviously we are still on a bull market. It makes sense to buy calls on the dip.
wait, did I miss it?
Who else is watching CLOV and it‚Äôs hulk candles
Yeah its called payment for order flow
please tell me you‚Äôre joking.. if not then sell asap and buy shares or leaps for a proven and successful company. that stock graph is ugly man
just depends if you need bennies and what not not, if its just for the check go for it and just be ready to not have a job at the end of the contract; youll get unemployment if you dont get hired on so youll be fine

I dunno... I just wanna see spy 420 as a bull...
How tf is it green lol
It can be explained with the Jeremy Bearimy model
I don't think they're looking at SPX, I think they're looking at the VWAP on SPY.

Come to Europe. The law system is 100% times better.

webull forgives gives one pdt violation a year
Since the beginning of this year, I‚Äôm averaging about 30 meetings a week, the majority of which (&gt;75%) are an hour or longer. 

Is this normal? When the fuck am I supposed to actually work while also getting in my daily shit-posting here? Puts on my productive time.
Thoughts on some SPY 450c‚Äôs in two weeks?
I've learned with my puts that you gotta be quick on the trigger, seems like almost every time if you don't sell after a nice drop it just comes right back.  Of course, that's what led me to close out my puts the Weds before the first 2-3% QQQ drop a few weeks back.  Oops.
Boot and rally, perfect for a Friday
T minus 90 minutes until the WEEKEND THREAD!
Sofi &gt; Clov on like 14000 levels‚Ä¶. People can shit on Sofi all they want with chamath and memes or whatever but its still a great company with noto at the helm and in hyper growth stage.

very underrated thing to do with $1k:

Load up on household essential things.
Calls on astros
In America. It takes about $34,000/year to be in the top 1% globally.
I think you could probably at least get a good spike for the November calls. Which means a spike to sell your December‚Äôs but as confident and as much as I love SOFI it‚Äôs going to take bank charter and then some to eclipse 20 a share in 2 months.

I may have misread you. If the December‚Äôs are also 17.5 I think you‚Äôre fine.
You forgot cup and handle and head and shoulders

Oh I presume we should be buying puts instead?
1 - The number of people who have lost millions and millions of dollars in the stock market from bad bets is too high to count probably. It happens all the fuckin time

2 - What makes you think that whoever purchased that used ‚Äúthe majority of their money‚Äù? There are a shitload of incredibly rich people in the world

3 - You can‚Äôt be certain that like half of those aren‚Äôt just hedges against even larger short positions. 

It‚Äôs admirable that we‚Äôre this close to 10/15 and you‚Äôre still so confident, but bruh, you have to at least see that your reasoning has some big flaws

Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people.

‚ÄúA group of Democratic moderates, including Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., were pushing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a few weeks ago to bring the bipartisan infrastructure package to the floor quickly after it passed the Senate, which led Pelosi to promise to bring the legislation to the floor by September 27. Pelosi came out and said that the bill would come for vote on September 30.‚Äù

https://www.forbes.com/sites/taxnotes/2021/10/07/crunch-time-a-tax-update-on-the-infrastructure-and-budget-bills/

Pelosi buys 175K+ contracts on 450C 10/15 on sept. 22nd and hasn‚Äôt sold. See where the correlation is? Bet you infastructure package comes out after market close bc holiday weekend.

I honestly don't know the motivations behind the mandate requirements, but it does come off as wanting to sabotage the US economic recovery. This will be challenged in courts though as this wrecks businesses ability to hire people and they don't want to pay a ton of money to test employees every couple weeks.

The idiots who cheered for this though bother me. They think it just hurts their political opponents, because surely they are the only ones not vaccinated, but this hurts everyone.

**Reason why $SPY will always go up**

Main requirement to join the S&amp;P 500:

&gt;last reported quarter must be profitable ‚úÖ

&gt;aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ‚úÖ

Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in todays economy.

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 10-20 unprofitable loser companies get delisted from S&amp;P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy constantly and always follows profits.

Apple is now refusing Astrology apps from the app store. 

Should do the same with Technical Analysis apps.
There needs to be an actual reason to crash. For example the last crash we had happened because the world though 50% of all people were going to die and the entire world was quite literally shutting down. 

Now rates are expected to go up and you expect it to have the same result?
I‚Äôm gonna need a few hundred boosters
Sure does. Really hoping for a do over.
Had 100 shares at $8 average, bought more at $17, didn‚Äôt sell any at $28, bought more at $20 as I expected rebound, and here we are. Bought low, bought high, sold nothing. I belong here.

I'm fairly neutral currently, my couple calls are holding me up pretty solid. I'm guessing today will be the last pump up because of that holiday, then Monday it'll be down on open
If you‚Äôre bullish I would load up QQQ calls right now
Clov received cms upgrade to 3.5 stars =more revenue and will become profitable real soon

Right. That's only going to be applied to the poor. If the Pandora Papers have taught us anything, it's that the wealthy are operating in an entirely different system, with a different set of rules, and can operate with virtual impunity as law enforcement and regulatory agencies have either been gutted or are actively aiding them.

The revisions to July and August jobs added like 300k. I was thinking the same but this info really muddies it up.

Been doing it for months
CLOV to 10
Take the spy bounce here
CLOVVVVV GANGGG RISE üòùüòùüòù
Apple has doubled and tripled in recent years. It‚Äôs more than fairly valued
Clov 30+ within 2 years
I have a couple calls for a hedge, but shit I'm hoping this starts to turn soon
SPY would probably dump more today, alot of uncertainties goin into nextweek, Inflation, evergrande contagion, fomc minutes, 10yr doing high jumps

Sir that song is a national treasure, how dare you
Low level jobs. Many jobs in my area are literally desperate for workers. I‚Äôm talking low level jobs such as McDonald‚Äôs, Walmart, etc. jobs you can be in Highschool and work. They have went from an average of $8-9 an hour average In the area to $13 hour average just in two years. Not because things are going so well, they are just so desperate. Many places are closing around here just simply due to a lack of workers

apple is inflated AF tho, and is the largest company on the planet.
Yea good call buying puts on a company that is 53% from its ATM with a P/E of 17. Lmao
Power pump eod
End of 2023, maybe.
SPY why you do this?
Looking for cheaper alternative to TMV and TTT Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bear 3X Shares ETF ...I want to short the long bonds, found two TMV and TTT, both are a bit expensive for me. Would love something in the 10$ range, couldn't find any. Also, is the a more levered alternative, 20+ 5x Bear? Maybe there is a better way to short long bonds with high leverage? Thanks for your help.
It was super bearish last night
Nah, she goes for over 500% return
And they‚Äôve been buying back stock too. Hilarious
It's a small cap, but I'm buying some calls for UPH because they are dirt cheap and I'm a gambler. They just had a stock offering which slammed it down like 40% and investors are still looking for answers, but I'm betting there will be clarification and this thing will run back up. Wish me luck
SPY 435 EOD
I've got 437.21.
People started using their brains to interpret the jobs report
later today should be good if we go down to 436, or possibly even 435 to fill the gap
No I am not, big bag hedgies and institutes keep unloading every stock/blue chip stock I buy even tho it would already be down 20%+ . I‚Äôm like ‚Äúhmm this is going to be a nice day trade‚Äù I end up actually holding it for months praying I break even.
Possible the mods are causing the market drop‚Ä¶.they went from Harvey Dent to two-face.
CLOVVVVVVV
üåàüêª just grabbed me by the pussy. I'd like to file a police report
Spy just stay down bby it‚Äôs not worth it
TQQQ $130 EOD
VXX barely moving
Went ahead and sold my 10/15 439p‚Äôs for a nice 30%. I‚Äôm guessing we do drop further but I got shit I need to get done at work and can‚Äôt watch them any more.
Global tax rate agreed upon
If things could just start taking off before market close, that would be great. My calls are drowning
My move too
I took my calls to the levee cuz they all died
VIX red

SPY red

Chinese stocks green

Who played with settings ?
CEO salaries are skyrocketing though so clearly American workers are doing just fine.
Bulls hyped at night. Gaybears delight.
Damn, I sold my puts just too early.
Incoming bounce back to 438.50 to fuck my puts even more, Holy jebus man.

Was there‚Äôs news?
I dont understand how poors and homelesses even exist, literally just buy SPY calls on any dip and get rich
Anyone else going deep af on BABA puts? Just me?

Huge bear trap

Bears if you value your Chasity then don‚Äôt go in
Identical sell for mega and indexes, calls on the cheap for next week is not the move, but it‚Äôs my move.

Well my shit ‚Äúportfolio‚Äù of shit just gave back all my gains from yesterday. I‚Äôm closing this shit down and not looking till Tuesday. Shit
Kinda funny, the expectation is the jobs report is good, so even when it comes in bad the market just pretends that it was good lol.
Based on which indicator?
yeah that's the bottom, 450 by noon
bears said for the 8th time in 2 weeks
Yesss let it rip right before market close

You are my hero
Yep. They‚Äôve grossly underinvested in production, supply chain, etc. Keynesian economics only works if capital is allocated appropriately. When it goes to things like rocket ships, and hydrogen powered semis that run on gravity, you start to have a problem
Can we get another "vaccine talks going well" for old times sake?
is she going down??
just sold my nearest BABA call. not gonna risk that one
Pretty chill since everyone had lost all hope

Must break 437.07 to keep dropping if not big rebound
Not losing money we just offsetting our tax liability by taking loses, it‚Äôs fiscally responsible.

Just act like you didn‚Äôt notice
Stronk volume at 438, still can go either way

Bulltober is coming don't worry Bois
well, with the curve inversion that happened in Aug 2019, could still lead to a recession, usually takes like 2-3 years after the inversion.

WHAT DA DOW DOIN
Last Friday was natural gas cos oversold - they printed yesterday. This Friday not so sure
Of course when I sell and don‚Äôt check for an hour or two.

It drops
Just got rid of my 20x 10/13 438p so I can eat in peace
You know shits about to get real when the chart on Marketwatch zooms way the fuck out
That was about 6 minutes ago lol
its heavily manipulated on Fridays so i really dont see the MM's letting it stay up on expiration day.  
im loading up at the LAST MINUTE of the market though because next week should be good.
You would think all the above would have been enough, but I like Breyers ice cream and Silk soy milk that I can not get at Whole Foods....so I did go there. That's over.
Bulls need to hold here
So the fed has pretty much given rich people aka "job creators" trillions of dollars to prop up thrir businesses, create new jobs and pay better wages and benefits, but apparently, they would rather just pocket that money instead of paying workers more, and then blame the government for paying people too much for unemployment. Did i miss something?
I think we are going to fill the fucking gap
Thanks :)

I had my swings dude and I traded vol my point was about follow through. That's like me saying godfather 3 was shit and you're like "oh well 1 and 2 were good" - you have a point but it isn't related to my point. I'm talking about follow through on directional trades. Yes the swings were nice for the vol plays, but for the long dated contracts I held with expectations of follow through it was a week for theta. that's all. Glad you had a great week though.

Fine one more time I swear
Too much alcohol, story too long. you have confused me. Calls or puts?
Iron condor that bitch
What retail hasn‚Äôt realized yet is that the very fact that more people buy options now than invest in stock has changed the meta and pricing structure of the underlying stocks themselves.

It used to be that stock price movement controlled options movement be in a normal balance.

But because of the shift of a mass majority preferring to buy options, it is now the options market that dictated the stock price. Let that sink in.
Lol

Bear: Did you ever hear the story about the shitfisher? SPY?

SPY: Jesus Christ!

Bear: Have a seat SPY

SPY: I don't want to take a seat.

Bear: This old Shitfisher took his bagpipes down to the river and he played his pipes in hopes that the shitfish would rise up out of the water. But not one shitfish rose, SPY. So he took a shitnet and threw it in the river and, lo, soon he drew it forth filled with shitfish. Then he took his bagpipes and then he played them again and all the shitfish jumped up in the shitnet. 'Oh, you dance now when I play, said the Shitfisher. And then the little old shitfish spoke up in the end and he said, when you're in a man's power, you must do as he bids you. Shitnets, SPY, and Shitpower.

SPY: What the fuck are you talking about?

Really?  It loaded this comment.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Just the once. You gotta tell them to disable automatic assignment/exercise, since that's the reason they don't allow it. Or if you have a decent-sized portfolio, trade spx. Better tax implications and gets settled for cash

My biggest fear is,

 I wake up to my phone going off and it's one of those presidental alerts you can't turn off. I turn on CNBC and everyone's panicked. The chyron says, "President Joe Biden died in his sleep last night. VP Harris to be sworn in"

And then everything absolutely tanks before my fat fingers can sell
Except because no one wants it to. So many puts have been fucked
Think the bottom is finally in, start loading those SPY calls so you'll have tons of cheap ones by the time we hit 500 EOY
I've made $3600 in theta this week. Definitely a new record for me.

These fuckers holding the market flat. What a bunch of assholes.
So many newbies on this chat lmao. If you see a GIANT green candle for a stock out of nowhere DON'T JUMP INTO CALLS. EVEN IF THE NEWS CATALYST IS GOOD. If the news is actually that good just wait a minute or two and get much cheaper calls. 90% of the time it'll just go back to where it was though.
Never get married. I‚Äôve learned this the hard way. Looking at you ex wife. What a whore.
What subjects do you teach?
Lmao. "If you didn't buy this stock that dropped almost 50% because the country it's located in is incompetent and will continue to be incompetent you're doing this wrong"

the headline at 4pm will be 'wow what a rebound from tech, q's closing +69% after a slow start'
We‚Äôre both trying, but in opposite directions
doubt it. Prolly just going to range rest of day so money can sell calls on peaks and sell puts on dips.
especially when it burns a little and you feel that wet feeling and you know you just squirted a bit. They kind where you know you need to sneak off to the bathroom to wash your ass and throw your ruined shorts into a public trash can because the whiskey shits from the hangover and super al pastor burrito you ate at 2am from the truck on E14th are on par with a super volcano
Buying up RKT shit is too cheap rn
I was banking on the investor calls, a surprise announcement etc.
Columbus day is bullish,  just a reminded
i know we are actually flat but my anxiety is fucking with me cause i want to get rid of these trades i've had on. that's my excuse.
Spy just needs to loose .50% and I wasn‚Äôt be giving handjobs behind Wendy‚Äôs
Maybe he'll read a bedtime story.
There is simply nothing in this world for me. Because I chose to become a public school teacher, my life's over before it even began. I will die in utter debt and poverty, without ever experiencing  the emotion of happiness.
Because the people with calls were insufferable last night and pushed people with puts away. And now all the people who have calls are broke and not here.
*Tries to pump the brakes* brake lines appear to be cut Captain.
If you didn‚Äôt buy BABA after it dropped practically 45% within 6 months then you‚Äôre doing this wrong
Haven't seen this place so bearish in months. Green dildos coming soon!! Always inverse WSB.
Indigenous Peoples Day,

SPY is doing redface,

Somebody has to be fired over!
Gotta always expect rejection on big, round numbers like that. Even if it's just short term. Sounds dumb but it's a psychological thing.

Wtf is with CLOV?  Short covering or insider trading?
Spy puts baby!
and they hate america

What is old Joe reading to us today? Also, yall acting like it's doomsday right now on a flat boring day

CLOV news is that its plan is rated at 3.5/5. lmao, clov tards grasping at at straws

This is fucking gross. Congress needs to step in and stop the red
Lmao. It's -.12%. Y'all dramatic as fuck
Who do you guys think is the better pornstar, Riley Reid or Remy Lacroix?
A crabby crab, if you will
See you Monday
Could be. 435 is definitely stronger support, but movement down on today's volume seems weak.
holding puts on spy is like waiting on an inheritance from an old person and they walk in front  of a stair case and you know ethically you cant push them down the stairs but your heart flickers a little when they step too close to the top step and wobble
he just tweeted lol
A mix of all the above. Won‚Äôt go into the specifics but I wouldn‚Äôt touch SDC with a 10 foot pole
lol good job bulls
Loaded 40 CLOV 10/15 10c‚Äôs. Already down 60%. Nice.

Goddamn, one of the few tech companies that make a profit, and it can't get anything going in terms of traction, huh?

Yeah let‚Äôs remove the most valuable company in the world from S&amp;P, autist
Spy crashing. The end is near.
I always wonder why the shills don‚Äôt even bother picking halfway decent companies. Like honestly most companies with a high short interest are in that situation precisely because they suck
Market looks disgusting‚Äîred dildos protruding. Very very disappointing.
Yes!!
Lower lows are bullish right?
Guys my new office gives a fucking *full hour* lunch break. It‚Äôs directly next to a gym. This is wild.
Why is it so quiet today?    
I feel like I am about to be that kid before a big exam, when it is spooky quiet, just yells to break the tension.
it's a Friday in October, I need to see SPY at 430 by the close of business today
WTF is CHWY doing, I keep having to buy more
It's habbening
Without breaching NDA, what's wrong with it? Poor leadership? Lack of viable business plan?
Boomer gang wins again
Are you really that dumb to not be in CLOV
They all oversold when China passed a law making them non-profit, they‚Äôre beginning to regain their legs before an eventual rebound to find their new sitting price. Atleast that‚Äôs how it appears to me
I think if it‚Äôs able to get past 438 it‚Äôs filling the gap to 435. Will see
Humanity should collectively forget about the Middle East and it‚Äôs entire history.

We‚Äôll throw in Florida as well for fun.
Am loving the cocktease from drill team six, you guys keeping us at the edge of our seats
BABA such a safe haven now.
Yes. Wish has gone done due to China ties. SDC is so poorly run it‚Äôs hilarious
That‚Äôs why it has stopped rallying :)
When he would go on live television and basically be like : ‚ÄúMicrosoft is great, I love Apple too!‚Äù
Facts but China is closer to par value than being undervalued
just a little more spy just a little more...

I think it bounces off 437 if it gets there.

worse than wish?!?!
There is NO reason for the market to rally any more
Come on SPY 437.24
i am not willing to give them such an excuse

they are bitter conspiracy theorists
Lol the reactions is priceless. Watching you is better then looking at numbers.

Puts on your emotional health, and lifespan. 

Go drink a beer and have lunch. Thank me later.
Eh, fuck it. 2 contracts for 28 day calls on CLOV. Wtf, what's the worst that could happen? I lose $128 bucks?
We would be better off sending our money to a Nigerian Prince in need.
This has literally been my worst week in my options trading history. I think I‚Äôm done for foreseeable future friends, good luck!
Again, not my point you call for 450 everyday.
Fuck I sold off my short ETFs like a bitch

MRNA is going to need to up their political contributions to make that happen 

If nations have made the decision to restrict their products it's not a great sign.
HMMM CLOV is moving, Ill take it.

Looking like the top is in for the year

Well looks like the boomers collected all my premiums this week again
we do consulting for SDC and it‚Äôs literally the most garbage company of all time lmao
MMTLP! Up 140% today and rising. It's my only green, but I'll take it.
Yo, we did it - you commented on my post last night. Took everything off the table for 200% now to bust out the Pappy.
Couldn‚Äôt break the downtrend. Sorry, call holders. SPY is tired and wants to revisit 420 next week
Anything else they do toward growth would hurt them. Start ads? Everyone would leave. Stop creating and buying content? They're already barely relevant and they've alienated many people with their content choices. Only downhill from here unless they branch into games or music, still very much done before.
I can see you are beginning your transition to the Darkside üåàüêª

This is the slowest bleed holy shit just let it go
Nope... all that spec tech money is going into what it thinks is the surest bet.

If it holds $140 we see new ATH next week.
We're the middle children of history man.

Austin is more like a cheaper SFO; good pool of grads from UTA, liberal lifestyle with Texas tax be idiots and land availability etc; I think it‚Äôs a good move.

But she's being sarcastic about being sarcastic. You don't understand.

She's asking "ain't it fun" which sounds like a sarcastic question because actually you're alone and nobody cares about you which isn't fun at all.

She's asking "ain't it fun to find out someone cares about you" while sarcastically mocking your bitching about how nobody cares about you because she cares about you.

Once you understand it, it has the energy of Hobson telling Arthur "you feel unloved, guess what, everyone is unloved, and coincidentally I love you"

one of the worst things about the bears of FinTwit is they have no sense of humor. the only thing they find funny is when people die and stocks crash or any other general bad news. They can't take a joke, and they refuse to participate in the rest of FinTwit's jokes

any time they come across a joke or a joke is made in their replies, they have to take it seriously and ask for legitimate explanations and reasoning because they just refuse to accept the fact that stocks just go up
Getting fucked on both ends. All my puts are on China, fuckkkkk meeee
Oh fuck we're drilling today blood red
Biden is hiding until he sells his puts for +10% before the inevitable bull run after his "speech".....

US market as a whole not very appealing imo. Just too expensive. Doesn't mean it will crash, but idk how many gains can be squeezed out of it. Could just stagnate.

If a woman ever rejects you,  call her obese and insult her profession. Tell her you were only making small talk to do your good deed for the day. She will immediately realize her mistake and that you are in fact superior, and sleep with you. This is how I got my first two wives.

can SPY just go down below 438 already and give me my tendies for my 438p? I wanna eat lunch in peace
I'm thinking it goes back to $75 next week, today's dip is to make all the $72 and above calls expire worthless

Much like my father, I am an unlikeable man. Friends, women, jobs have come and gone. I‚Äôm pushing 40 and unable to advance in my career like so many of my peers. I will never have the income or soft skills needed to raise a family of my own. I have 2 amazing dogs that love me unconditionally. They are the loves of my life and the bond we have keeps me going. But anyways, big thanks to WISH for offering an e-commerce experience depressing enough to suit even my meaningless existence.
Didnt think id say this but I actually think CLOV is now the move...  
They got nothing but good news consistently coming out including their PPO plan being upgraded today.  
Stock is basically at ATL  
Fridays its always manipulated down even on a great news day like today but i think monday itll bounce
RBLX calls ????
apparently the showrunner for the Netflix program *Dear White People* is a white woman who is suggesting she will be boycotting Netflix because of the supposedly transphobic most recent comedy special by legendary comedian Dave Chappelle, who is a black man.

I have no social or political opinions about this but I am very bullish on NFLX
Next hour or two spy will bounce up hard. Well my calls are hoping for that anyways
Very cool
Full straight autist rn. 49 contracts deep of 450C 10/15, could pull a 20K bagger. Odds in my favor bc no financial recession till 9/1/2022

So maybe stop being a little bitch and listen to me for once
Holy fuck SPY just moon or drill and stop me out already.

Hit me with your‚Äô THIS STOCK IS WAY OVERSOLD ‚Äú and I‚Äôll hold puts over the weekend ( unless it‚Äôs Tesla )
I'm not an ape and I don't believe in stupid ape squeeze shit.

I bought calls when it was at $5 to hold until its $9. Because that's where it should be.

Not enough jobs added is bad for tech, to many jobs added is bad for tech, everything is bad for tech
Im so sick of this yield bullshit can the market just fucking crash already instead of being attatched to the hip of the 10y?????

Luckily converting my EOW calls yesterday to credit spreads at the top seems to have paid off- shit was hella risky though with 440/441 strikes.

Aight bro see ya at every bar in the country
tried coffee for the first time in 10 years today. now i remember why i dont drink it.
Anyone see how Biden speaking could be bearish at all in light of terrible jobs reports?


The only thing I can think of is him doubling down on vaccine mandates which means job reports will continue to be bad which effects the tapering. But I would imagine he wants to ease the public with those terrible numbers.
PLTR is soooooooo bad

because SPY reflects the S&amp;P500.... you'll need movements of the underlyings in the index to do that
Is Biden going to fucking speak?????
Absolutely, and I mean ABSOLUTELY no one cares what the fuck you think. Go put your tinfoil hat on and talk to the guy in the trailer next door about your boycott

I know people who physically cannot get a vaccine because of allergies or other medical conditions. Now they will have a very hard time working for a company of over 100 people. They are essentially being pushed out the labor market. I suspect at some point the mandate will get struck down by the Supreme Court. I'm vaccinated myself but I think forcing it to be mandated to companies when we have labor shortages is just an idiotic idea.
Mr. PLTR wrong way sir.
Yeah not coz of taper but coz of boomers panic selling hearing taper

What's your end of year target price for AFRM?
You can buy VIX calls when it's in the 15's. 

I had decent returns on it until June. 

You can also buy puts when it gets close to 30 but they need to be 60 days out min. The returns honestly aren't worth it for how long your cash is tied up in it. When VIX is near 30 the IV is so high you're typically overpaying.

Is 25% in your portfolio a good return percentage for the week? Genuine question
I fucking love NVDA
Gold and silver are pump and dumps
Why does losing money feel so much more bad than making money feels good
Can‚Äôt wait for next crash coming soon. Loaded with some $5 bills in my room gonna deposit a few to BTFD when SPY is at $350

because it dropped $15? lol
I'm not pissed at price action I'm just pissed at my own laziness messing up my timing. I want one last dip to buy more calls because I was out of buying power at the last bottom but now that I finally got around to injecting new buying power into my account SPY is just like "theta gang in da house" smh
Futes still fake but this is basically what futures implied would be the trend all night to a tee
Mama said there‚Äôd be days like this

I just didn‚Äôt know they‚Äôd be so bad or so frequent
A while back someone posted the link to their sub here in the daily and I checked it out and idk dude.  We all make fucking mistakes.  That was mistake number 1 for me....
Well, that sucks. RIP my TSLA ODTE

It'd be nice if one of the billionaires would just pick a direction they want SPY to go.
Lol is SPY really just gonna bounce back and forth in smaller swings in this dumb range all day long? 

You really gonna make us wait for Monday to dump again SPY? So immature

If you‚Äôre an experienced trader why are you hanging out in a pump and dump/cult subreddit?
Can we like 10x the requirements for posting share positions or something? It would cut down on the number of gay ass stock promotion astroturfing posts and encourage more options plays, which most of the January bandwagoners are too pussy to make.

It's the Kardashian of the stock market
No hope
Honestly bro, fuck this game
Wtf is wrong with this market today. Just up an down up and down

It‚Äôs a Cardi B song
Any thoughts, financials seem willing to go higher. JPM and BAC made all time highs for 52 week, during this week.

They do look like they could break higher, but is it a fakeout?

Seems indices at point where could go either way.

Was that the drawdown and we blasting higher, or correction continuing?

PLTR is the biggest disappointment in the stock market right now
I have to give it to PLTR gang they are persistent. Almost a year straight of sideways trading with no end in sight and they still won‚Äôt let go. It takes some epic retardation to continue holding a 50x P/S meme while bond yields are going like this üìà
Timezone?
Xlf fds
all out steam
I've been taking notice when I go out to speak with clients, shelves are empty, staff has been reduced to the bare minimum, one register open.

One of our main distribution hubs is about to be completely empty by months end and the orders we made in Q1 still haven't arrived. We're being told to expect it in Q1 of next year, maybe.

Shits gonna get worse way before it's gets any better
Yeah I didn't really like it either. Guns feel like water guns or something. They have no weight/feel to them.
Keep holding those bad boys
Cant short it as long as it growa 50% per year. When growth stops or slows, it'll tank fast
1,600 for 31 for me
Otly drilling
So what you're saying is we should all get a job working at resturants to pay for our "investing" accounts. Got it.

TSLA has the best charging network and FSD tech by far. But then in June they announced opening up their infrastructure for charging to all manufacturers. And then yesterday they announced they are going to license their autonomy software to other manufacturers as well?! Wtf are they thinking? I'm surprised its not down more, that's awful news.

The average US consumer objectively loves things that are terrible decisions. Getting financing for depreciating assets, buying lottery tickets, overeating saturated fat and fructose corn syrup foods, overbuying large assets due to upselling, and generally a lack of a budget or regular savings ("pay yourself first")

Betting that instant gratification will stay around is probably the safest bet you can make. At that point its just a matter of setting the loan rates to cover the rate of debtor defaults, and that's a pretty straight forward business model.

I would assume that different infrastructure is needed for offloading containers vs oil, so I guess it would depend on the port and what they have the infrastructure to unload.

&amp;#x200B;

As of priority, I'm pretty sure ships have scheduled time that they are booked to unload at a specific port.  So if a ship shows up early they have to wait until their scheduled time, no priority on what type of cargo as far as I know.

You murder strangers for food every time you cash a paycheck to take to the grocery store, and you're waiting for the day you can actually just murder a stranger by hand instead of doing it from afar, but you don't remember any of the explanations of how the world works where you started to realize this is true, because you're too much of a dickhead to let yourself feel any guilt about it or try your best in life.
When I feel that way I just sell far OTM puts on an index. Say 10% down and 30-45 dte. It's hard for that to go tits up even if the market tanks.

reasonable request. NTA!
Yes, because you can't afford to remember you were the one that wasn't interested in discussion. That would interfere with your psychological ability to murder strangers for food while rationalizing how nothing is your fault. By the time you have to start committing those murders by hand and watch life leave the victims with your own eyes, suddenly not as comfy letting others wrestle in the dirt for you like you can today, you'll have done everything in your power to forget every conversation like this.

Was the same on Wednesday
This is how the market correction is going to go down. This is how the MM will layer it: Because they can't cause massive panic, in order to take it down 20% they will do the following. First, the MEME stocks take the biggest hit bc that fits their narrative and gives CNBC someone to blame. So meme stocks go down 25-50%. Energy and gold will go down 20% because they are always sucker bets. TSLA will take a massive dump of 25%. After that comes Tech goes down  10% bc they have to leave some hope for average investors who already made massive gains. The banks will go down the least because, well, they run the show and they will use the interest rate narrative to feather their nest. BaaS will be the biggest gainers and the new buzzword.
I hope for won win.
You had 2 weeks to buy calls
Yay, bad jobs news &amp; the Fed gets to keep the markets bloated
Only PLTR could close a near $1B deal and still be down 12% for the week.

yes it does, it's just sucking up all the theta possible by forcing players to sell before it picks a direction. but this will go somewhere by eod, my guess is down.
hope it works out for you. i think we break this consolidation soon
I believe so its a day trade right? Probably gonna be a day trade then my boy!

Took my a lot of time and money to learn but finally figured out how to dump my losers.  Feels so good to sell a crap a position for a 30% loss and then see 2 months later it‚Äôs down another 10%, even with SPY near ATHs
That‚Äôs awesome, i gotta couple g‚Äôs and I was just going to microdose .4 but you guys are tempting me to do all of it
Red light green light
The dip already double bottomed and the bad news has been out for a while so Spy weeklies it is
This right here
Holy shit CROX is getting destroyed
Honestly, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôll do some small plays here and there to play the volatility, but I‚Äôm not going to pretend to understand wtf is going on anymore.
QQQ calls going brrrrr

We never ask how *is* Lambo
Spy is going to bounce between 438 and 442 for most of the day. Causing paper hands to get angry and sell.

We're not gonna see any serious movement till 2 or 3.

Right now, theta is fucking up everyone's options
It's like that crazy sexy ex gf that left you for being too jealous...you know you want more!
Bros, don't let that happen again. 2% SPY incoming.
Rip Norm.
Santos &amp; Prophets hate Theta gang
Most speculative and leveraged.
Just buy calls when it has those huge red candles, it will always rebound.
Fuck yea there is üõª üõª

I'm so jealous of whoever bought AFRM calls monday/tuesday
Absolutely man. Keep on doing you!
Honest question. Did you like that show? Only episode 6 (marbles) was good. The rest was trite dogshit
SPY isn't going to break out into any direction today is it.
Same
It‚Äôs not bears vs bulls. Its everyone vs thetabois.

Why is tech always the most affected by everything?

gonna spend the whole fucking day consolidating and then set up to dump next week? meh
Ugh SPY just dump already you know you want to. Please I won't be a gay bear again
Its gone almost up .1% this week alone
anything to limit gains is good for stress
RIOT should see some nice gains next week 10/22 calls for me
seems like a question to ask yourself my friend
I doubt Monday will be green...
i‚Äôm selling half &amp; holding half

not really related to the discussion of societal death though so like i said it seems like you're just looking for an angle by changing the subject
We will moon from here let‚Äôs get ready
Hold calls over weekend or sell at break even today?
Buying calls further than a week out really does limit my stress
Red light! Green light! Green light! Gogogogogo!
Please pick a direction. It can even be left, as long as you pick one direction
Aint nothin but a g thang babayyy, buying calls cause im crazayyy, when they in the money, market makers betta pay meh!
Damn I should've bought some calls at that little dfs dip
I tried to save face with 300c MSFT before it started playing ping pong, solidarity comrade

i dont think we trade sideways with the vix down that much. this is consolidating into a breakout.

The market will be closed on Monday.... it will also be open on Monday. It goes both ways, like my dad.
Well $10/gal on a 15 gal tank would cost $150/wk to fill up. If you make more than $150/wk and don't drive 800mi/wk you are still coming out ahead making $16hr x 40hrs = $640  minus gas and taxes you still have money
Today has been a stupid day
Lmao I got in at the start of the big red candle and out at the the end. Literally one candle

Most people don‚Äôt realize this, but if you take a nasty shit and don‚Äôt have fresh air to breathe, put your nose under your shirt and press the shirt tightly to your face. Inhaling will draw on the air between your body and the shirt, before it pulls from outside the shirt due to the pressure differential. 

There is at least a half breath of fresh air that doesn‚Äôt smell like poop inside the gap between your body and your shirt

It‚Äôs like an emergency air tank

**[Holocene extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction)** 
 
 &gt;The Holocene extinction, otherwise referred to as the sixth mass extinction or Anthropocene extinction, is an ongoing extinction event of species during the present Holocene epoch (with the more recent time sometimes called Anthropocene) as a result of human activity. The included extinctions span numerous families of bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates.
 
**[Psychological projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection)** 
 
 &gt;Psychological projection is the process of misinterpreting what is "inside" as coming from "outside". It forms the basis of empathy by the projection of personal experiences to understand someone else's subjective world. In its malignant forms, it is a defense mechanism in which the ego defends itself against disowned and highly negative parts of the self by denying their existence in themselves and attributing them to others, breeding misunderstanding and causing untold interpersonal damage. A bully may project their own feelings of vulnerability onto the target, or a person who is confused may project feelings of confusion and inadequacy onto other people.
 
**[Cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)** 
 
 &gt;In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance (guilt) is the perception of contradictory information. Relevant items of information include a person's actions, feelings, ideas, beliefs, and values, and things in the environment. Cognitive dissonance is typically experienced as psychological stress when they participate in an action that goes against one or more of them. According to this theory, when two actions or ideas are not psychologically consistent with each other, people do all in their power to change them until they become consistent.

SPY fighting hard rn
They will keep spy pinned between 438 and 439 today
Never hold over the weekend unless you're investment is rock solid.
Is this a serious question or? SPY is the main ETF for the S&amp;P meaning an ETF for the most successful large cap companies. If a company starts to suck it gets removed. It‚Äôs why SPY is naturally always going up/recovers strong from dips.
Greatest dip forever
Someone call Tucker and tell him my portfolio is being cancelled.
I‚Äôm with you brother
Yes
Looks like theta gang is gonna win today.
So the jobs report was bad?!!?
I‚Äôve given back my gains many times. Took me forever to learn two things and all my recent fuck ups are attributable to breaking these two rules:

1. Set a stop loss, and if it hits, step back and don‚Äôt go back in to that ticker without waiting.

2. When up 80% or more on contracts in a single day, sell all of it, not half. Withdraw most of that money from my brokerage account immediately before making new positions.  Also, sell when I get 2x, 5x and 10x.
Yea that was the bait to reel me back in
but why? its been stuck between 54-55 for 2 months now
Lol what semis you got
higher highs - lower lows

Resistance is getting weaker &amp; support is holding up.

Oh shit that's actually pretty clever! It's got the symbolic Value about it. Actually made good money buying puts the day it went up like 20% even though they said things won't cost $1 anymore. Might play it again.

jokes on you... I dont have a job
its just to fucking early to bet against the small dick club

People who "aren't interested in a discussion" usually don't continue trying to have a discussion with you after you refuse to answer their first question, ask them to answer a mirror of the question instead, and then refuse to read their answer just to troll them.
You don't want to be that negative guy but seriously...I can't wait to see the SDC retards cry in unison
I've sold and held cash waiting to get in lower a few times over the years with apha. Bought back in lower, made gains. Things feel wrong these days with them though. Different. I'm cash right now but thinking there's more down side coming without any huge catalyst. As per the other reply, I've lost confidence in the market in the whole right now. Too freaked to put the cash anywhere right now. Not confident enough to sleep at night with it in play these days so just chilling for a while.
Watch goggins and stoicism
wow SPY. that a piece of shit you are. Truly a bag of horse shit.
have a good friday too bud!
damn fucking pull the rug already man

That was my plan too with 305s. Play earnings with undervalued and IV they should print.

thats it for me guys. 36k ‚Äî&gt; 72k ‚Äî&gt; 7.5k all time

Bullish for banks?
Why isn‚Äôt Robinhood allowing me to trade with my instant deposits for today? My contracts has to be 2 weeks out?? Wtf
$100 a barrel isn't a fucking meme.
The reason why I picked 10/29 is due to earnings are on 10/26. Either way these calls will be worth 3X-5X as much with the run up and the IV on the day of earnings. I don‚Äôt plan to hold most of these through earnings. I do have 189 $355 10/29 lottos that I will hold because I believe Msft will fly to fucking Pluto

Warning this post IS financial advice:

Try to minimize the number of short term options you purchase and only put money in those options that you can afford to lose.  Options are an inherently high risk financial position and constantly applying high risk without any sort of hedge will eventually move your account to near zero values.  In gamer terms you are going to roll a natural 1 eventually.

Financial advice portion over.

Steel stocks are down bigly.  You are a huge idiot if you don't have big money on X and NUE.  They are 100% going up again the price of steel is insane right now.

If you feel like you might never be able to contribute to society because your brain doesn't work at the level of how complicated the world really is, then there's hope for you. The self-awareness to even have that fear is better than nothing. Some people's brains are so non-functioning they wouldn't even have that fear.
Good for you. Emotional trading at best
i dont know why i still try, but here goes: **monetary inflation is not happening. we got a good chunk from govt spending, sure. but sustained inflation is not the same as scarcity and supply chain breakdowns. that doesn't mean supply chain issues wont persist, imo they will until there's a war/population decline. that doesn't necessarily mean the US dollar is worth less, that means goods and services are not abundant as they used to be.**

Meth does wonders for for memory issues and, oh yeh, memory issues.
There are tech stocks and there‚Äôs aapl
Whenever I feel like that for a decent stretch of time I just dump it and move to a play I have more confidence in. For 1 eating the loss helps go against my gains for taxes, for 2. I don‚Äôt like holding something that makes me a downer. I can be confident in a position that‚Äôs down and be fine, but if I lose confidence in my own plays shit gets put on a timer.

Probably not I‚Äôm until we break out of the 438-440 will we see a direction.
HIT IT JAY!!
Well with the way we‚Äôre struggling even with the debt ceiling issue patched up, I‚Äôve got pretty high conviction we‚Äôre gonna dump at some point today.
Lmao there is not fantasy, it‚Äôs kinda reality
Playing inverse dailies today 

DIE OIL DIE
I‚Äôm getting real tired of your shit spy. Hurry up and go back to ATH
SPY, pick a direction already
What are we buying SPY FEB 2022?
Just go below 439 just for min my man
Lmao sdc volume solid for one hour. We sling 7 inches now solid dick club
So, RKLB had a prospectus become effective today but saw very low volume last night and in the morning, indicating that the newly released investors didn't sell off. Following that, it rallied.  


Looking at the orders, I see lots and lots of little sell orders coming through every trade route, which suggests large block sales broken up. Unexpectedly (to me) though, large buy orders also came in, not broken up.  


Gamma is harshly negative below 15 so that's a key level. I'm not sure what my thesis is here, but I'm holding puts I bought yesterday and the day before, now at a small loss. I might roll out to November because fundamentals on this company are not there, and the option chain is not really loaded up past October 15, plus large investors might just be waiting to sell into the strength generated by memey mania.

Consolidation
Bulls ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
we are out of time to reverse climate change, that is different than innovating technology which will prevent it from killing everybody

i mean it's pretty clear the financial and egotistic incentives those at the top have to protect the population. if more people die, that's less employees and less customers. the ego one is a bit more subjective.

nobody is saying "let's just die" you are making that up. the situation is going the way it is now because of usual market and political inefficiencies. regardless though this is completely beside the point about society being near death

the way you are using fake quotes and repeating my words back to me as questions make me feel as if you aren't interested in a discussion and you're actually just looking for an angle and edge so forgive me if i just go ahead and bow out here
SDC retards are getting as bad as WISH retards were last month.

There is a lot of opportunity for people who can take advantage of labor shortages though. Independent truck drivers are making a future moving goods across the US because of how desperate companies are to move or receive goods.
* If the fear of death inherent to human nature and animal instinct is sufficient to ensure we will innovate in time, how come instead of scientists saying "we are trying and we have enough time" and everyone else saying "let's help the scientists and give them enough time," we have scientists saying "we are not really doing anything about this and we are out of time" and everyone else saying "we don't really need to do anything about this and there's plenty of time?" 
* What financial or egotistic incentive do those at the top have to protect the population from drastic effects of climate change? 
* Given that incentive, why would those at the top have brought us to a situation where the scientists are like "we're out of time" and everyone else is like "let's just die but say we didn't" and why would this situation be going the way that it is now that we've gotten into it?

People don't get it yet, buy low job taking is the most bearish of all.

1) Supply chain and wage pressures won't abate -&gt; higher inflation
2) We may be at full employment already, due to many leaving the labor force. This means the Fed is years behind the curve on policy tightening.

Just wait for next week's CPI, you'll see...
Look at the volume, though. Not many are saying that right this second. Maybe a fugazi day but yeah I don't pay attention to that particular ticker.
My job I do little to nothing. They charge my car, feed me lunch and about to go to school and they will pay for that.

The average American hardly knows what the Fed is, they will blame Biden. Either way though the Fed is responsible for absurd house prices and stock price valuations that are contributing to wealth inequality, so tapering might not be so bad.
Tesla....man no matter how good the news is they just can't shake the sentiment that it is overpriced.   I guess when they trounce earnings ....it is already priced in at this point....feels bad man.

You guys think the fed will risk having the average american hate them? That's what will happen if they go through with the taper too soon. They will be blamed for a slump and I don't think they'd risk that. They need the blame to go to something else.
For real it was a big quick jump which is making me think this ath won‚Äôt last for long. May dip some next week

BABA is a monster!
Squid Game is South Korean. i find that a lot of television and films coming out of Korea are pretty good, the directors really seem to go for it rather than fall back on tropes. though that may be a language barrier type of thing or general unfamiliarity with Korean stuff

Shit stock
those are probably the areas where i'm most concerned but i don't think it's indicative of death of society

climate is bad but not yet uninhabitable. before it completely devours humanity we will innovate defenses out of necessity. infrastructure obviously needs to improve.

the innovation of agriculture has begun and hopefully will continue with advances in vertical farming and lab growth.

i never suggested society is perfect, but some things being bad != dying society. there will always be room for improvement and certain drawbacks to face, it's signs of growth rather than death

Squid Game is a very good show but i personally don't think it's as worthy of the unhealthy levels of obsession it has garnered. i am very happy for all of those involved in the creation and production of it though and the further recognition of foreign media

How do so many people get VP level+ get to where they are without having a basic understanding of how to look at or improve a process or workflow?  CFO just told me that accounts payable doesn't really have processes because they handle money not parts.

But that actually created a fuckton of new technologies and at least decimated all our competition and turned them into customers.

BlackRock and Vanguard are among the largest shareholders in Evergrande that have posted hundreds of millions of dollars in paper losses following a more than 80% share price drop in the troubled Chinese property developer.

Data from S&amp;P Capital IQ show US-based Vanguard, Evergrande's third-largest shareholder, has seen the market value of its holding plummet by $156m since the beginning of January as the Chinese company teeters on the brink of collapse.

According to S&amp;P Capital IQ estimates, which are based on the latest market close, Vanguard‚Äôs stake in the world‚Äôs most indebted company ‚Äî the result of investments made via the US firm‚Äôs mutual funds and ETFs ‚Äî is now worth around $33.3m, around 82% less than $189m value at the start of 2021.

The data also shows that BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, has suffered a $95.3m book loss on its Evergrande holding, which at the start of the year stood at just over $111m.

The collective unrealised loss for the two US fund management titans is around $251m.

If you're too lazy to try to complete your understanding of the positive and negative outcomes of your choices, I rate you a piece of shit.

But if you're the opposite of lazy about it and you use that effort to try to limit your understanding on purpose, you're worse than a piece of shit. This is why downvoting me to feel better about yourself doesn't work. Whatever shred of self-awareness you have is just having its feelings hurt by watching itself take the basis of a piece of shit and make it worse and worse.

Don't get guh'ed.
Can confirm. Am hedge.
I go by the predictiveness of the model. As I've gone through life, the conclusions and predictions drawn from analyses of the scientific model have been pretty much undefeated in testing against what I perceive from my 5 senses. Other models, like the "astronomy isn't real and the sun is just a light on the ceiling" model, frequently lead to conclusions and predictions that end up contradicting the input from my senses, and so over time I've thought more and more that I've proven to myself those models are insane and the scientific model is most likely the correct one, to the point where now I don't really bother with doubting it. So it seems there really is a sun, we really do get all our energy from it, we really do get all our food from plants, it really does have a limited amount of fuel, there really are satellites orbiting the planet, they really can measure the planet's temperature and atmospheric content, we really can tell how long ago a fossil is from and analyze how extinctions have happened in the past, we really can tell what the temperature on Earth was and what its atmospheric composition was in past eras, etc., all the stuff scientists say they're very sure of and have proven as fully as possible. And I've seen for myself that it really is true plants can die when conditions are too harsh for them. So it is true that agriculture will fail if we don't do anything about the atmosphere getting too hot or the sun running out of fuel. So I spend my life trying to stop the atmosphere from getting too hot and trying to prepare agriculture for a hotter atmosphere and trying to stop the sun from running out of fuel and trying to expand our existence beyond this solar system to give us chances of survival, and I keep trying to group up with others doing the same, but I haven't been able to do much so far and it's unclear whether I will be able to succeed in the long run and there don't seem to be many others to group up with and it's unclear whether anyone else working on this will be able to succeed in the long run and there are billions of people who just keep making it worse every day, and as a human whose brain evolved to understand other humans who's spent a while living and gaining experience for that brain to get good at understanding those humans, I've come to the conclusion that it seems like most people will refuse to stop the killing until it's too late and the people who are already trying to stop the killing have a very high potential of failing.

Don‚Äôt like cancer know someone that went through it like me well everyone downgrading sdc not mentioning how they have patent to treat cancer their way approving the 26th. The patent (US 11,154,539) will grant on October 26. It will protect the SDC-1802 molecule and pharmaceutical preparations thereof as a therapeutic to treat cancer selected from pancreatic, colorectal and kidney cancers, melanoma, and B-cell lymphoma by inhibiting TYK2 kinase. The program is in preclinical development.

Yeah if you take out all the terrible numbers it's pretty good imo.
Hmm. Don't think my $448 SPY calls are going to hit today

Look around you at the all the people making risky trades, buying internet funny money, and overextending to purchase homes right now, all using the logic that the Fed will just always continue to prop everything up.

This is going to end so, so badly

SDC is a shit stock
So the market goes up on bad jobs report--&gt; because that means tapering won't happen sooner...so the market is solely relying on the fed to hold off tapering? And we just keep going higher and higher? But nobody asks hmm what if the fed just taper regardless? This house of cards is honestly quite impressive

My small business is offering 33$/hr to fill 2 positions empty for 10+ months. Usual starting for minimal experience we will train you is 27, market rate/local comps for those with 3-4 years experience is 31-32/hr.

 Every applicant we offer a job has come in with minimal to no experience but with other unrelated work experience. When we offer them the job, they‚Äôve walked after demanding to start at 40 or higher. Job includes employer match 401k, health plan with 2500 max deductible. Most of the some other work experience types come with secretarial experience as the job can build on that. It‚Äôs mostly phones forms and scheduling.
In europe too. it is also becoming quite attractive to just sit home. Social security seems to be improving so why would people want to work their ass off when they can live a decent life without working...

Good news everybody, companies are so efficient now that they don't need to hire people! SPY to 500!
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs due to the fact bad news = potentially delaying the taper
I deserve a good day
So first of all, how do you figure society isn't dying?
I spoke to an employee at target the other day and he stated that they‚Äôre getting very picky with who they hire. Shortages are not the reason their shelves are empty ü§î
That's why they'll taper (to appear like they're doing something to help), even though tapering won't really help with inflation because most of the qe isn't being lent out (see continued rise in reverse repo). I also don't think rate hikes are possible, at least over 4%, because the market will shit itself.
Enjoy the ride

Education are the ones that didn't come back though. Down 144k and 17k for state.
well i don't think society is dying for one. secondly i don't fully buy into the whole "evil puppetmaster elites" thing. there's some truth to it of course but i don't think it's as sinister or dystopian as a lot of people try to make it out to be. people make these stories about giant shadowy plots and conspiracies when in truth there's just a lot of incompetence at all levels and some pretty big egos that get in the way of market efficiency

in truth i feel like the vast majority of people are just living regular life in regular society and the actual roleplaying is when they pretend we live in post-apocalyptic times and i think that view of the world is really shaped on the internet and by people who refuse to consider any nuance
Yeah‚Ä¶ they said on earnings they have 0 supply chain issue and their cotton price is locked in through next year and a low rate. Idk
Because life is so expensive and a lot of these jobs pay well below COL in their area.  Plus there are few livable jobs for people who don't have 4 years experience and a college degree.  Why work if I can't afford an apartment anyway is the mindset in the country right now.
Pretty sure most companies valuations have doubled in the last year? Have their earnings grown at the same rate as share prices? No they havnt lol

It says a lot about current valuations that the only thing that can support them is the fed. Take the fed away and this thing drops. If you are long right now the ONLY thing that matters is the continuation of fed money. Not earnings and not the economy
And that should be even ‚Äúworse good news‚Äù in terms of hoping the fed will delay tapering.

Do you mean people getting fired? If so there was united airlines and I know in New York at least 2000 teachers got an  unpaid layoff since October 4th just to name a couple. If you mean about those the unemployment rate do not take into account.  That system doesn't take into account people who quit or aren't allowed an unemployment check via firing method.

Trying to process these unemployment numbers:

So we hit our target for unemployment by end of year goal: 4.8% (very good #)

We missed new jobs...bigly. lowest # of the year: 194k (this is very disappointing number)

Labor force participation: 61.6% (horrible)

Average hourly rate it up: up 0.6%

Zealys take: these fucks still have money in bank accounts &amp; people retired/fully exited work force. Boomers not going back to work. Also saving was very high this year and it's been dropping.

well to be fair as a non-minimum wage employee you could probably shop your skills on the open market and get paid a more fair salary elsewhere

i'm in a similar position where i probably could do that, but rather than ask for a higher wage i just increase automation of my own tasks and keep it to myself, so i basically get paid the same amount for less work. in turn i give myself more downtime which i'm trying to use to increase skills and get a better job than i'm currently qualified for

Also, this week, we had deep reds at the beginning. The fact we didn't have a red night last night was a first too

The understanding if you had been following is that good jobs report would mean early taper.  Bad would mean later taper.  Market more interested in taper timeline.

As someone who makes a good salary in a cushy job, I don't blame people for quitting shitty retail/service jobs. I'd rather just be broke and unemployed than broke and working at Wendys. I genuinely feel bad for fast food workers when I go lunch after a long day from "working from home", which really means smoking weed and collecting a 6 figure salary.

Many states still have elevated unemployment benefits, and even though the eviction moratoriums may have ended, it takes months to get people out.
SPY doesn't even know if it wants to go to work or stay home.

Damnnnn baba go up
Every &amp; every news is bullish
Fuel prices are a good bet, but DAL likely hedged through the year when oil prices were dirt cheap. Id check their statements for details on that.

Higher prices with higher demand is bullish imo, less flights might help ur thesis.

I dont like airliners but i wouldn‚Äôt be betting against them right now. Maybe mid 2022

Lol üòÇ I meant right - I had a heavy night
I'd work so hard just for room and board if I was allowed to work, but if your idea of "working" is actually just taking abuse and not getting anything done, you're gonna have to offer a LOT of money to waste my time.

Problem is there aren't any jobs available to the general public. There are these things you can do to get paid and people call them jobs because everyone's used to calling it that when you go somewhere to get paid for your time, but let's face it, the wording isn't accurate anymore. Pretending to be a self checkout machine isn't work, it's the overlords paying plebs to roleplay as plebs.
Tried it on PC and Xbox Series X. Only reason I mention that is it went from awesome on PC to really clunky/glitchy on Xbox. Overall I liked it a lot although I'm not usually a fan of massive battle type modes

yeah that is good, my company will probably do that eventually. companies that don't automate the warehouse staff will get devoured by walmart or amazon.

my position is pretty similar to yours and i make a decent chunk more than warehouse people but their job is so much more involved than mine even though it takes no thinking so i don't think they are paid unfairly, but it's just waste since it's something a robot could do

Honestly, all I remember about it is a sort of non harmonious screeching. Probably not an accurate description of the actual soundtrack, but that's what I took away from it.

Daniel Day Lewis is an awesome actor, though.
it's funny to me that for decades people have been demanding increased minimum wage and businesses threaten to automate those jobs and they still haven't had the balls to really go for it.

these companies will get eaten by amazon because they refuse to automate and therefore refuse to lower operating costs. also disincentivizing workers from finding alternative employment because they think scanning shit at a counter or putting slot A into slot B repeatedly is a legitimate enough skill for the workforce
Fuck Microsoft got me BigHard for a second and is now blue balling me.

They are trying to automate that warehouse shit. I see the executives bragging about investing in robots to replace all those uppity factory workers.

My spouse teaches.  Pay is not good for someone with a college degree.  It‚Äôs a lot of work for the pay, a lot of exposure to sick kids.  She does it because she likes it and summers off work well with our kids schedule, but she knows could make more money in a normal 9-5 with overall less stress.  I think it will get even worse with inflation, as now you really need a married couple with TWO incomes of 100k+ to buy a 4 bedroom family home in most metros

But since the overlords just want everyone like me to die, and the list of stuff that needs to be done starts with a bunch of improvements to our chance of survival, I'm not actually allowed to start on that list without paying to do so, much less be allowed room and board in return, let alone get paid for it.
It's gonna be worse next month because they are firing people that want to work but don't want the 'vaccine' I can't believe that they don't realize that negatively effects the jobs #.

Yeah true
My brokerage account
It‚Äôs plainly obvious that the Fed policy is hurting the economy more than helping, and that‚Äôs why we go down on bad numbers. It‚Äôs now evidence that tapering needs to happen. 

Also, every horrible piece of economic data makes it less likely that JPOW returns, and his replacement will certainly not be as market oriented as he is.

Yes, look at TLT nose diving. That‚Äôs bad
Yea but if that had any effect on the numbers unemployment would be higher than last month.  I just mean how we gonna add jobs when we can't get raw materials in manufacturing.  Small sample base, but two people are out of work at my job for having covid this week.  I work at a company with less than 50 people.

personally at my job we can't really automate the lower departments since it includes delivery via trucks so we just have ridiculous rates of turnover since we won't increase those wages and anybody with a CDL can pretty much name their price elsewhere so we're just really inefficient lately

I was talking about this crisis a few weeks ago, my fianc√© is a teacher and she‚Äôs telling me they literally can‚Äôt find teachers. It‚Äôs becoming a crisis and now you see it in this report apparently. Teachers are leaving in mass. This is bad

local government teachers, down 144,200
No taper. Smells like CALLS
Still waiting for the first domino to fall
Apparently when you spend literally decades trying to stop the population from accomplishing anything and forcing them to subject themselves to abuse to earn a living, people who were born into that environment never develop an addiction to working because instead of their brain developing an association between work and feelings of accomplishment, the main thing mentally associated with work is abuse.
Ah, ok. Sometimes those short ass headlines make no sense to me
Or inflation due to Fed policy is really bad for the economy.
I wouldn't consider any movement related to the report.

SPY literally *always* moves at open, regardless of anything.
Hurry up and open so I can buy the dip!!!!!
Cant be bangin in siccc for no reason m8
Job report is bad which means good for stocks since no tapering by the Fed. This also means higher inflation cause less goods made but more people on unemployment to buy them. Higher price means more profits for companies and they have to pay less employees. üåàüêª fucked
Bad. But good for tech and index ( as ppl expecting less taper from Fed)
Bad from the standpoint of the real economy. But some people think that it will prevent the Fed from tapering down their bond buying which could be good for market.
No no you think it [will be 455 EOD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q3hajl/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_october_08_2021/hft0e3t/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)

I know of some feds that quit because if the vaccine mandate. It's impossible to get fired as a fed.
same numbers as 420 69 (1)
spy puts maybe
the answer is clear to me and it's insane the businesses refuse to see it. two options, both of which are mutually beneficial

option a - increase wages

option b - increase automation
You actually want lower jobs numbers other uses yield rise. The fear becomes that the velocity of money is moving too quickly If there‚Äôs  an explosive jobs  report and this inflation is going to move quickly. That‚Äôs why bad jobs reports usually yield Green Days
[deleted]
Lol what‚Äôd you do to get fired?
Give me $5k to pay off my debt, throw the rest into SPY
I'm feeling DAL puts for next weeks earnings. Anyone else?
Sell your puts quick!

Jobs report misses hugely, market fucking skyrockets. Can't make this shit up.
Jobs miss means more people are free to buy the dip. 

Get in while you can
What if everyone on WSB applied to every shitty job opening and then quit after being hired. We could pump the market with inflated job numbers and then buy puts for the next month after HR managers across the country realize they‚Äôve been hoodwinked.

We‚Äôd all be rich. üòé
Policy
Accounting creativity
Seems more like a neutral reaction than anything. 

Dump failed. Pump failed. 

Just dead lay.
There is literally class warfare being waged as a result of COVID, but no one is calling it that or officially recognizing it. Look at the jobs report. Businesses are buying billboards shaming workers for not coming back to work a shit wage job. It‚Äôs a standoff, and the workers are winning. Businesses don‚Äôt know what to do because the direction work culture in the US is going is pulling away from traditional corporate structures and it‚Äôs at odds with serving their shareholders.
Reversing already lol
Guess who are customers to tech
Those job number as terrible lol

Manipulated to continue to not taper??
I saw that number too. Is there a source that has a break down of that by demographic? 

This is absolutely insane
It was sooo bad that it‚Äôs good
I'm greeeeeeedy.

I came here to say exactly this‚Ä¶ yet the way that they calculate unemployment they state the unemployment rate is 4.8%‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous

I wonder why my Shimano (smnny) stock jumped 15% overnight ...
You don‚Äôt count as unemployed if you‚Äôre not drawing unemployment? That seems odd.
The 500,000 jobs that they were expecting was already revised down from 1 million. 194,000 is so low people don‚Äôt understand, that‚Äôs one of the worst prints we‚Äôve ever had.
pre-emptive market drinking is my only solution at this point
Look at that 10 year fall‚Ä¶

unemployment down but jobs missed big? error? market doesn't know how to react
Only 194k jobs in the most favorable month of the year?  Covid being less of an issue than most of the past year and kids going back to school freeing up parents to take jobs in September and a measly 194k jobs gain is what was reported?

Fed November 2-3 meeting is going to be really interesting given this is the last data point for them other than inflation.

Based on the UE numbers it makes no sense for the Fed to announce tapering in November.  Past couple months have been mediocre to bad data on unemployment.

I think they have to wait until December but who knows...

Payroll has to be a mistake, how can you miss that big and still have unemployment down?
I think inflation not unemployment is the main concern for the fed now
Prob because unemployment benefits can be denied. If your denied, you aren't a statistic, even if your unemployed.

Virginia did this when I was a kid. They boasted these great low unemployment numbers, but really the system was designed to where it was just extremely difficult to get unemployment.

Hahahahahahahahahahaha, And historically bad. Just like I predicted
I feel like I'll never be able to run a big business because people are too retarded to find the ones smart enough to hire. Like, my job interview is gonna have some basic linguistic questions to make sure the interviewees can understand and use English properly but that's such a rare skill any enterprise I attempt might just die before finding a single person to even try hiring. 

On the other hand, maybe if there are a tiny few more smart people out there than I'd expect, I'll find those smart people and my business will be unstoppable with the lack of normies working there

That's a pretty good concept
We can start with your Gov. then move to overweight rednecks
The main reason people who have moved out of California is cost of living according to surveys of people who have moved. The main reason people who have moved to Texas is work according to surveys of people who have moved to Texas. But you can keep telling yourself otherwise if you'd like.
If I get diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's can i get my margin debt expunged on medical grounds?
It‚Äôs like buying a used broken condom. You wonder why it‚Äôs not protecting your wife from her boyfriend.
Is that why thousands of people a year are moving to Texas? People are buying houses in Texas sight unseen and moving.

yeah that's definitely a huge part of it, unfortunately the elite aren't necessarily smarter and this goal is very shortsighted as they would actually benefit from not corrupting the labor force like this just maybe just not in the immediate term

it's wild to me that it took a global pandemic for american employers to start considering that they've been essentially getting slave labor for decades and maybe it's time to start considering that something resembling an equilibrium price of labor at the very least might exist and most jobs are nowhere near it and literally everybody would be better off if we were to strive for it

I like how everyone on CNBC is downplaying the Tesla move to Texas. No this wasn‚Äôt always the plan. Yes there‚Äôs an actual reason why it‚Äôs happening, and no it‚Äôs not just because of taxes. This is a much better business climate, a much better personal freedom climate. The same way people want to move to the United States versus other countries. The empirical data shows that, the same principle holds true ‚Äúwithin‚Äù the United States. More people want to move to Texas. These people are dumb and can‚Äôt wrap their mind around it.

I have 3 questions for "penny stocks can be worth up to $5" gang. I will not accept the sounds of gargling on Uncle Sam's dick as answers so don't mention the SEC.

1. What the fuck is the point of having the phrase "penny stock" available to use in the English lexicon? Like WHAT USE does it have?
2. What the fuck does a penny have to do with it in your eyes? Why the fuck is the word "penny" part of the phrase?
3. What makes your answer to questions 1 and 2 so fucking valuable to you that you need the phrase "penny stock" and you need to use the word "penny" in it and you're justified taking it away from people who want a phrase for stocks that are under a dollar so that they can specifically refer to stocks that are the absolute cheapest in the market, that can't move in increments less than 1% without trickery, that may be at risk of delisting - you know, stocks where the price per share being what it is actually matters and there's actually a fucking point to being able to communicate about it with a simple 2 word phrase?

i‚Äôm not sure how up to date you are on the whole GameStop situation but Amazon is heading for bankruptcy and GameStop is now their biggest competitor.

market cap isn‚Äôt there yet, but the company plan is on track.

also Jeff Bezos is the target of every major corporation now.

Amazon CANT survive the next few years with their increasing bad reputation from littering and burning unused inventory to labor rights with their workers being violated.

Amazon sounds great, until you look underneath the hood and see all the parts are grinding and screaming.

GameStop is targeting Amazon to be the epicenter of e-commerce/gaming.

this GameStop earnings has been MASSIVELY anticipated and i believe Amazon will continue to develop a negative correlation to GameStop.

so what do they have to do with each other? competitors and GameStops about to make the move with a bite to the jugular.

Bears always fuck things up
You're not going to convince me, and your idiotic effort to do so just ruins a phrase that could have been useful.

There has literally never been a time where idiots like you trying to change the meaning of a word TO SOMETHING THAT CONTRADICTS THE ACTUAL FUCKING MEANING resulted in a successful change of meaning. All it does every fucking time is ruin the word and make it so that people don't understand each other when the word is used and it gets used less and less over time as a result. I fucking hate you people so much.

Definitions of words change in ways that make sense, attempts to change definitions while making the opposite of sense always just result in damage to the language.
Democracy is as fake as most pumps

I was bullish this week and made some decent cash, but I put my money on short-expiry puts yesterday. It‚Äôs been swinging wildly the last two weeks. May as well play it both ways.
If you think penny stocks can be over a dollar and you have Uncle Sam's fingers so deep in your asshole that you think the SEC agreeing with you makes you look less incorrect rather than the reality that it makes it even more obvious how incorrect you are, then please keep trading. Deposit everything you've got and go all in on options. The market wouldn't be the same without the power of your brain
The definition of words changes over time whether you recognise it or not, it makes sense to expand the parameter given inflation.

Just doubled down on SOFI, this fucker never wants to come down looks like I‚Äôm averaging up
Imagine being so dumb you think the SEC can just change the definition of two very commonly used words

SEC: "we decided penny stock doesn't mean penny stock anymore"

You: "ok, I'll tell everyone who doesn't buy this bullshit that they're wrong for you daddy"

So if you were to bet money on it, and I mean actual real money, is SPY going up or down today?

I saved $119 dollars (thats right: cold hard cash baby!) to put in 0dte options and I'm going all in today.....

EDIT: I dont mean to brag about how rich I am everybody. Listen, we are all in different places and some of us just have extra to throw around the casino than others, and that's ok..... Thats ok. You too might even get there one day. I sure hope so!


     ---says a chimp who likes to throw poo---
The SEC changed the definition bro
Pre market slanting down on chart slightly.  Gap below on spy to 435.  I think momentum takes us down.
I just wish they had more liquidity. The bid ask spread is usually ass.

So many articles are insanely useless trash. Like they never add anything meaningful or teach you anything
Tell me youre from the east coast without telling me youre from the east coast
If the definition of a word only changes because people are using it wrong in a way that directly contradicts its actual meaning because they don't know what it actually means, then people who are actually good at language don't recognize the new definition and we will just continue to uphold the valid definition over the invalid one.

Yeah, like I said, most traders don't know what a penny is so the Wikipedia page on penny stocks is fucked up.

For better info, look up "penny" on Wikipedia, and then maybe "dollar" if you still don't understand. These Wikipedia pages are much more accurate because they've been edited by poor people who actually handle physical pennies and dollars

I'm just saying whenever TLRY has good news they never hold their gains and plummet. And it used to be when TLRY is up the entire cannabis sector is up. So I'm hoping Sundial brings the entire sector up with it

I had no idea about the milk thing either until I learned about it in medic school, which is kinda funny because it's not like milk gets stored in ambulances. I just double checked because it's been awhile and yep, soaking in cow's milk is best, otherwise saliva. You wanna get to a dentist or urgent care soon though for the best chance of having the broken off part of the tooth reattached. They say 30 minutes or less is what you should try for.

Same as rolling calls you bought. You keep your profit and, yes, sell the next week out calls. Learn about them. Investopedia explains it pretty well. If you do it right, you literally can't lose. It's like a savings account that pays 150% a year.

See you shill to much, im very long Sophie but just spamming shit for no reason looks stupid
Actually no ice is needed for a chipped tooth. Keeping it soaked in milk or saliva is what is advised, but op should definitely save it just like you said. Lots of people don't know to do that.

SPY needs to open flat because otherwise it's going to just keep making gaps to fill. Open flat and then freefall to 435 or go up to 444. My bets are on 435.

Nice astrology
Or, sell 13 or 14c a couple weeks out and roll them every week. Might have to buy back if it actually gets there but then you ride it to the top and start selling cc again. I have 400 shares at 15.50 and I make about $80/week. It's bullshit money but if OP is holding the bags, he might as well get something.
Friday is usually my worst day for options, and with that being said here's to 0dte SPY calls

Employers are expected to have added 500,000 positions in September, a number seen as strong enough to keep the Federal Reserve on the path of tapering asset purchases as soon as next month. Strategists surveyed by Bloomberg say the print would have to be below 200,000 to cause a major reassessment of the health of the U.S. economy and send Treasury yields lower. Indicators coming into today‚Äôs release do point to a strong labor market, with the initial jobless claims number dropping and 51% of small businesses saying they had unfilled positions in September. The unemployment rate is forecast to tick lower to 5.1% with earnings to rise 0.4% in the month.

The next Daily Discussion thread is [here](https://redd.it/qm2tw3)
Checking a stock after you’ve sold it sometimes feels like looking at your ex’s Instagram
My 4 month old survived his kidney operation, I am so relieved, I have no friends so I’m just venting here. Now LFG gme
Has two months to buy GME at 160-180.  Buys after it runs over 20 percent

Complains

Some people in this sub are so retarded lmao
Earned a quick $200 on a call then locked my keys in my car and had to pay $200 for a locksmith.

The universe giveth and taketh.
Come save me at $420 GME boys I’ve been waiting almost a year lmao
Zillow employees Jan 2021: "I'd like to pay 20% over asking. Thanks"

Zillow employees Nov 2021: "Would you like fries with that?"
Don’t buy shit at open you dummies.
I just brought GME near its high lmao
Time to FOMO into meme stocks and lose money
#Ban Bet Won

/u/commieconfidential (1/1) made a bet that GME would go to 225.0 when it was 214.39 and it did, congrats fucker.
Boys, I feel like gambling today.
Down ~30k all time, up 50% last week 😎
#GME SWEET BABY JESUS
Zillow just lost the only thing that was suppose to make them money and people are saying buy the dip?

What's their new profit model, ad clicks on their website?

LMAO, trash fucking company has a bright idea to run up the housing market then suprise Pikachu's when no one quilifies for a loan for their expensive as fuck 2 bedrooms 1 bathroom shack in downtown Pheonix. 

They deserve to bleed to a penny stock.
!banbet GME $300 10d
NVDA isnt stopping, crazy
I had 600 shares of Ocugen at 0.32. Sold for pennies. Big fucking rip
Gme new ath this year?
JPOW just announced every federal employee must have a mechanical backlit keyboard

CRSR going to 50
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/tallpaulpaultall (0/2) made a bet that SQ would go to 265.0 when it was 254.0 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Reporter: "What are your interest rate plans?"

JPow: "Bears r fuk"

Reporter: "What about inflation"

JPow: "Bears r fuk"

Reporter: "How will you know when to raise rates"

JPow: "When all bears r fuk"
I hope you fuckers make a stupid amount of money today
I have a feeling today is gonna be a wild fucking ride
Congrats OCGN gang
LMao OCGN isn’t being flagged as elevated volatility because it does this all the time😂
So I guess we're all buying into OCGN at open? Can't wait to add more bags to my collection!
650% profit on GME in 20 minutes I can’t complain lol
Buying GME calls yesterday before the yearly breakout today was the alpha play. Thanks retards!
Holy fuck having a ton of money and quitting my job it is the ultimate fantasy.  Until then I am literally a slave.  My daily routine for the next 20 years is something like, "Yes boss what dumbass code can I write for you today, sir?"
Lost like 7k on GME calls in like 5 mins :(
JPOW would be the perfect fall guy for tanking the markets.
  
Biden would hate to replace him with a diversity hire and have *them* tank the markets...
Zillow CFO should be given wsb hall of fame award for buying the top of the housing bubble, and then trying to sell the bottom.
IT IS NOW CALLED POWELLL HOURRRRR
GME go brrrrr
"fuck off with your rate talks, bear" -Jerome Powell 2021
I had to run to the bathroom 5 times within 2 hours last night and I’ve already shit twice today at 6:24 am. I work in the field cutting down trees and shit. For some unknown reason I decided to go into work today. Think I’m gonna go home and trade instead
Made $200 on OCGN today with only 18,000 of risk 😎
This shit is not transitory Jerome. You’re going to fuck us.
I’m psychologically prepared for blood today.

But I know Jerome will pump this shit
OCGN is going to soar today!
OCGN price target anyone? 😳
My timing is impeccably bad
I made $7,000 on meme stocks today. Really puts a dent in the -$20,000 all time losses I’ve sustained
i have not sold my OCGN.
Zillow is going to Zerow
I keep flirting with that magic $25k account balance.
Flat if tapering begins this month, market rips if tapering begins in January (my guess).
Definitely quitting No Nut November today
18 million shares traded on OCGN premarket. Looking good.
Dont miss the $OCGN rocket my fellow retards!🚀
My ocgn $10 call expires in 2 years lol
BBBY and OCGN, let's fucking go
Hello again OCGN
Ready to buy high GME and AMC high and sell low, as always🚀🚀🚀🚀
!banbet GME $450 1d
After my Covid shot my iPhones 5G is fast as fuck. It’s insane.
The gambling with your life saving rush, is one like no other.
Bull trap. Bear trap. Bull trap!
Remember, you make the most money on emotional decisions.
Glad I didn't take that job at Zillow...ouch.
Lol. I got denied for margin on my new fidelity account. Then i applied again but exaggerated my net worth/liquidity and i was instantly approved
Fuck it, tsla calls at open
I got bed bath and boned today
My boy JPow is about to light this candle! 🧨
#FED VOTES TO TAPER

#SPY REACTS BY GOING TO 600
Top of the morning GME
Well fomo’d back into gme. Let’s go
I’d like to parlay my !banbet GME $300 2d
I will rim every last man in here for TSLA 1250 eod.  Book it.
!banbet GME 270 1d
RIP my 1300 tsla call
Looks like it’s costco hot dogs for thanksgiving
Was up 15k at 10am, now I’m up 1500, seems about right
Lol bears going to get fucked for trying to bet the other way on this taper
Oh no… our market.. it’s broken
JPOW literally just said that if we dip too much they will pump the markets back up. 

Buy the dip.
SPY 500 EOY isnt a meme
# $TSLA $1300 IS NOT A MEME
Congrats TSLAtards!
#Ban Bet Won

/u/When_Rug_Pull (2/0) made a bet that GME would go to 240.0 when it was 218.2 and it did, congrats retard.
I’m taking a massive dump so that the market doesn’t have to.
Some of you never heard of sell the news and it shows
OCGN EUL approval 🚀
Watching OCGN rise is making me anxious, like either that is gonna shoot up and make my calls print so haaaaard or just get obliterated upon open and make me lose it all. Blood pressure and heart rate are JACKED.
I’m squealing! $OCGN baby! Patience paid off
GME gamma ramping
Does anyone buy shares just to make it a nice number? Like fuck owning 497 shares imma overpay just to get those 3 more
GME stop playing! I have a doggo to feed
Jerome just whispered in my ear we all good then walked out of the shower
Is spy now a meme stock?
Damn JPow is so careful what he says.

Bidens agenda depends on this man's word. Crazy power
from the bottom of my heart. Bears deserve this. Get rekt you toxic cunts ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Tesla back over 1200 today
OCGN the only play today🤑🤑🤑

/u/DigitalSoldier1776 (1/0) made a bet that GME would go to 231.0 when it was 183.83 and it did, congrats autist.
Bought TSLA puts at the bottom yesterday, now I bought calls at the top.  LFG fellow retards.
Imagine waking up and thinking about other things than stonks. Sad thought
Damn boii, OCGN going mad this morning, I like it :)
OCGN homies
Go TSLA go!
**AMC GME BB FLYYY**
Where are my OCGN long Investors at
The bull run will last until 2099 when the Y3k bug causes a minor crash
Imagine trading all year and ending up at a loss. I should fukin quit. Waste of year
Who bought OCGN at $18+? Come to the front and get your autism award.
BIRD now offering EV shoes
Cathie wood bought Zillow dip yesterday at 85 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
If you think this place is retarded, head on over to Stocktwits, that's next level
# BEARS LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Everyone saying bulls are fucked are about to be left behind, I'm riding this spy rocket to heaven you fuckers 🚀
Im the only one not making any money 🤡 🤡
Tsla don’t hurt me today
“LeTs gEt tHis bReAd” more like let’s watch my portfolio drop 50% in the first minute of trading
Whether it goes up or down today, one thing is for sure: OCGN is going to be volatile as a motherfucker
Ocgn I’m in.
Regret not going all in on OCGN calls.  Its like 90% of the contracts ITM
Good ole GME
GME is gonna have another +90% day
I have a gambling problem. 🎰
Wtf is OCGN doing bruh
Hypauthetically, If we all flipped the TSLA calls to puts we could lay this baby back down to 1k in style. Only saying this because I hate upvotes
It just occurred to me that I could set up an ABNB account, rent a Bunch of rooms, then hand out vouchers to homeless people to squat in those rooms, tell them they never have to leave and the cops can't kick them out, and buy ABNB puts. I would be solving the homeless crisis while making $ when it gets reported in the news that dozens of homeless are squatting in random ABNBs and can't be kicked out. Genius
Zillow literally bagholding billions in real estate 

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
This sub ALWAYS YOLOs into stocks that mooned AH the day before then wonder “why no BRR today!?”

🤣🤣🤣
Gme and Ocgn happy new bagholders 🤚
Watching my GME calls throughout the day has been like taking drugs and now I’m coming down from the high
#HOW YOU BROKE FUCKS DOIN
“YO! EVER HEARD OF JERKMATE?” On max volume while in a bathroom stall of a McDonald’s

Zillow getting absolutely dicked
38 min until the algos dump everything and buy it all back 3min later ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
There go SPY. Must be some bad news.
oh my god, that elevator on SPY
Holy fuck. Tapering is good for SPY?
JPOW to continue asset purchases but only in the metaverse
ATHs will continue until morale improves
Too much hype in here. SPY will now trade sideways for the remainder of forever. Thanks for playing
Bears stuck in the past, SPY to 750 BOYS
So basically JPow is the CEO of SPY and QQQ.
 I guess SPY forgot to dump, it's back at the top again.  Silly SPY.
Cathy wood bought 25 million of Zillow yesterday…..
JPOW: no one is working, supply chain issues, inflation rampant....everything is good, keep printing.
#Ban Bet Won

/u/fe2sio4 (1/1) made a bet that Z would go to 65.0 when it was 76.26 and it did, congrats you fuckin nerd.
Now this is the kind of power hour that I read about in the brochure!
Didn’t watch but I assume JPow’s speech went something like this 

“Inflation is transitory, fuck poor people, SPY to Andromada (SPY 690c 12/17)”
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/NarNights (1/1) made a bet that VXX would go to 26.0 when it was 21.96 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
looking at tesla daily chart gives me vertigo
Puts on QQQ seems like the obvious move so call is the play I guess
Who else can’t sleep because of today’s hype? Let’s see some volatility in this circus.
OCGN 22 Mil volume in pre market.
100% daily average volume on ocgn,while PM

Bullish af
WHO approves OCGN to sell 3 billion vaccines worldwide

Way more than MRNA's 50 million
GME its a legendary day
Can't believe just FOMO into GME, yet again....LOL.
GME this high without even an announcement from ryan cohen or shorts covering, if those happen we will moon so hard
GME apes are coming back

may tendies fall on us all
TLRY gang is waking up
Doing a quick vibe check for the people who bought DWAC at $175
has anyone thought of throwing your money directly in the trash in order to save on commissions?
Got 0DTE 462 calls and 460 puts. Let's ride the lightning!
No matter what happens during the fed meeting today, I'm sure to lose money
For people wondering if they should buy Zillow, please go understand why it tanked in the first place.  The CEO did not sound confident and they’re cutting 25% of workers. 50 EOM
SPY CEO about to announce earnings in 15mins, who got puts
It’s transitory and it always was
Algos gone wild. Seems fake AF. Don’t get conned.
Six months ago: "Inflation is high right now, but give it 6 months and things will very likely go back to normal on their own."  


Today: "Inflation is high right now, but give it 6 months and things will very likely go back to normal on their own."
TSLA going to the moon you dumbasses
AAPL is making 27x in profit compared to TSLA, but TSLA is already half AAPL market cap. Must be a sign that TSLA is gonna be 27 trillion market cap!!!
OPEN THE GOD DAMN CASINO
Tesla couldn't handle not being the centre of attention for 2 minutes
HOLY SHIT OCGN
OCGN shorts today: 

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Taper pretty much announced without announcing it yet this morning 

Should be fun today
You probably have about 5 seconds when the market opens to do anything with OCGN before it's halted
Looking at OCGN it has a 30% short / 56.98M shorted against it, I'm guessing in the anticipation of WHO delaying or not authorising. 

Now WHO has authorised it and pre market looks so good could there be a short squeeze??????

I'm not expert just looking at data
If you ever feel dumb for making a stupid trade, just go over to r/stocks. Reading their questions and comments will make you feel real smart, real quick
Time to trade emotionally
IF AMC GETS TO 44 IM TAKING HOOKERS TO THE MOVIES TONIGHT!

The fact that everyone thinks it’s going to dip when Jpow speaks, of course means it’s going to rip.

This is straight up gamble. Nobody can predict this shit.
So yes tapering, no rate hike?
Lmao took Powell like 10 seconds to figure out how to answer that question
There could be a war between US and China and SP500 would still go up.
Tesla be like “sorry I’m late, here’s the daily +5% I owe ya”
[deleted]
TSLA swinging my portfolio by hundreds every few seconds has me jittery at work
POWELL HOUR!! 🚀🚀
I am not FOMOing into Tesla calls again….

Or am I? 🤡
If bbby hits a 25b market cap today I’ll donate $1000 to st Judes
Ocugen is really gonna fuck me releasing this an hour before open lol
Money is like cocaine

Jpow is the supplier
These OCGN calls about to straight synthesize profit. Moving up from the dollar menu, we're having Denny's for breakfast today!
Yall think Ocugen gets halted?
OCGN short shares disappeared in a hurry.
!banbet gme 240 1d
GME just doing GME things
OCGN weaklings shook off, now we’re good to go :)
Y’all ready to talk about GME here again?
I had 2 gme calls yesterday for 205. I sold one of them. God I'm an idiot
I can’t believe I’m thinking of messing with GME again after getting burned so many times. I think I have a problem.
Took advantage of that GME rally 🚀🚀🦍
Used my barcode scanner on the SPY chart this morning.

Turns out it's the UPC for a printer.

#fuck your puts 


*a boy from Bulgaria*
I shall not FOMO. FOMO is the gains killer.
Should I hold my OCGN or sell? WTF is going on? I thought this stock was supposed to soar!
ATVI getting drilled harder than the girls that work there
This is not the GME show which I have signed up for 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️
So tired of the articles saying how much Elon is worth every day. It's just a dumb measurement.
I think GME gearing up for another ride uppies into the afternoon
In his final move, J Pow brought a shock interest rate increase that tanked SPY and forced boomers out of retirement. Full employment was achieved as J Pow rode into the sunset.
YOLO on SPY calls?
Zillow puts were the move.
Spy actually looks cheap right now lmfao
GREEEEENNN DILDOS
Powell cancels recession, bears lose again!
"The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time"

They say the same thing every time and the market still reacts like they said something new.
‘Spy too low imo’ ~Jerome Powell
This looks like the market is about to moon wow
My calls are printing, puts were way too obvious.
Why the frick did everyone thinking tapering was bearish?
Did he just blame inflation on the port of Long Beach 😂😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡

Ya has nothing to do with you printing 1/3 of the money supply in a couple years

HAHAHA. All the cocky bears here an hour ago silent. Absolutely in SHAMBLES.
JPow: seems some people mistakenly took transitory to mean this would end at some point. Just want to clarify that transitory means permanent. Thanks everyone.
Jpow Tldr: I'll show you why it's called S&P *500*
Imagine shit talking your stock… and still hitting ATH 😂😂😂😂😂😂

Daddy Elon 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘🏻
It’s insane. Like just buy calls and go to sleep. That’s the scientific method
Tesla gonna open at 1270 or something tomorrow Jesus

The spread on GME is insanely large. .50-1.00-1.50.

DSR is having an affect.
When does Jamal Powell speak?
TSLA’s recent run up is more in anticipation of stock split announcement than Hertz purchases imo
Bro I need to study but I know Im going to be watching tickers all the day.
Jpow is announcing today that he found a way to take the crank powered money printers and connect them to motors.
Got a tesla $1200 11/19

Bought TSLA puts at $1190 this morning and still down after it reached $1161.

That’s what I get for buying FDs.
If you ever played COD: Black Ops, you won't be surprised why ATVI is tanking right now.
Sorry guys, i bought GME calls earlier

jpow: its the feds fiduciary responsibility to clap them cheeks. now lemme get my tools.
just got approved for options trading, what should I do first
zillow down 23% what a shame itll be down another 20 tomorrow
Zillow keeps exiting the screen and the app has to zoom out constantly to keep up with the freefall. Love to see it.
im beginning to think that RIVIAN IPO next week will be the biggest first day stock gainage maybe in history
Ok. I’m gonna need TSLA to moon to save my weeklies.  

Any time now would be great.
But mommy the guy at McDonald's said Ocugen was going to hit $60
Meanwhile in a bathroom at the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell stares intensely at the mirror in front of him. "Transitory" he said. "Trannnnnsitory. It is transitory. We will be highly accommodative. Accommodative. Highly Accommodative." 

"They are ready for you Mr. Powell" an intern said as he opened the door. 

Jerome straightened his tie and took one last look into the mirror. "Time to fuck your puts to death" he said to himself as he left the room with the smell of printer ink still fresh in the air.
Algos are happy.
JPOW boutta hit a line of coke. Crank the printers up boys
Wow. 11 million people on this sub now. Been a while. Hello new retards.
I love when people come here trying to make sense. That’s how you lose money. This sub is about being as retarded as possible and having it work out anyways.
Fed news was bearish af for the long term but well, nobody gives a fuck about the long term
[deleted]
bulls blew their load a little to fast
If there is inflation we need to raise wages to match the inflation. Its criminal to let people get priced out by oil price inflation and supply chain screw ups.
Aaaand this is why you don’t over leverage yourself with puts when the fed speaks.
Zillow got taken out back and brutally jumped. Love to see it.
Spy could go from 800 to 740, 3 years from now and bears will say “I TOLD YOU IDIOT! I KNEW THIS WHOLE TIME” 🤡 instead of just making money
Im in for a 10k loss if papa JPOW doesnt jam the printer.
If $JPOW were a ticker I’d buy. Full send king.
Bears so broke they don’t even have shambles left.
For all of you who need the reminder today:

Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.
Damn. SPY said, “Get your damn hands off of me!”
Printer man just saved so many retards from bankruptcy 🤑
I love JPOW's non answers that wont tank the fuckin market
the fed: time to taper boys

tsla: brrrrrrrrrrr
I love JPOW so much.  I’m naming my first born after him.   What’s a girl version.  Paulina?

I have no fucking idea what to trade rn. This is mania
No one manages to trap Jerome in a got ya question, he’s a master at answering what he wants
I just sold my SPY calls up +235%.

I wanna buy SPY puts now, but I know I'll give back all my gains.

I bought 5 shares of Z yesterday. I’m down $100 on just 5 shares
Okay bottom is in on OCGN at least that’s what I’m saying to myself crying in a corner. I didn’t take out a balance transfer to lose money!
VIAC destroyed my marriage.
Show me…surprise rate increase!
At this point Ocgn will go to $6
I got my cheeks wide open. OCGN is deep in. all the way to my throat already. How much deeper can it go?

I was salty in the morning that I was selling my Z shares for a $2700 loss 😪 but happy
That it was $2700 and not $3600 if I had held on….
Reminder that the Fed already sold.
If this ends up being JPOW's last act as Fed chair, I highly doubt he would want to sail away known as a paperhanded bitch.

HOLY SHIT SPY
Totally normal price action
What the everloving fuck SPY
ATH. NEVER NOT BULLISH
Hahaha

Bears
get in retards, we're going to the moon
Lmao what. The. Fuck is happening
Did JPOW announce negative interest rates or something?
Holy fuck i just scalped 4k in 2 minutes on that SPY candle.
SPY beat earnings? Good for them, CEO getting fat bonus
Imagine not knowing the statement comes out right at 2pm and speech later 🙄🙄🙄
You pick the red crayon, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.

You pick the green crayon, you stay in wonderland, and I show you how deep the money printer goes.
"Mr. Powell, would you like something to drink before you give your speech?"

"No thanks I'll have plenty of bear tears"
I'm pretty sure the Fed will be forced to hike rates well before we get to June. This response to inflation is way too dovish.

Man this guy loves his printer
My spy calls are cumming 470c here we go

Increasing asset selling each month, only selling 15 billion to start.  Inflation is good for the rich! Transitory for the poors.  Keep buying our assets we are selling, k thnx.
The gov will lie to protect rich peoples assets every time.

I love this place while watching a press conference, it’s like being at the movies for the premiere of Infinity War.

I should probably take profit on some calls....

TL;DR 
-tapering priced in
-No interest rate hike until 2022 Q2-Q3.

Jpow basically saying bears r ded. Buy calls
Come on JPOW announce 10k AMZN gift cards to everyone for short term help with inflation.
ABSOLUTE EUPHORIA HOLY FUCK
Jpow says the printer stays ON during sex
Jerome must be living paycheck to paycheck since he fully understands what people are going through with higher costs of goods and inflation
JEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOME FUCKIN POWELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Jerome finally admits inflation is persistent and is not going away. What a clown LMAO
Theory: Like me, JPOW bought into the ARK hype and he has to pump the bull market for another several months so he can break even and free himself from Cathie’s grip.
The only stock going down is Zillow lol
Hahahahahhahaha

Fuck the bears
Hulk dick on TSLA
I hope that retard short TSLA by a million bucks is still averaging down today

Oof
Yea, that's pretty retarded.
SPY is such a bitch ass nerd today. I miss when it was a crackhead.
It's literally waiting for FOMC. It's going to rip up or down based on that.
Market always drops on my Bday, sorry boys. :/
It’s not a lot tho at least
Hopefully we get one last thrust! 🚀🚀🚀

This game sucks, why am I not rich yet

Can confirm. I’ve lost more on indecisiveness rather than my actual losses when I  take the plunge
Just waiting on Powell to speak so I can start opening positions. I’ve only been closing positions since this morning.
"Manchin says 'unbelievable' Virginia results validate concerns over spending package"

That's the end of the infrastructure / social spending bill. Hope it was fun playing "infrastructure talks going well" during the month of October.
>That's the end of the infrastructure / social spending bill. Hope it was fun playing "infrastructure talks going well" during the month of October.

Put 8k in OCGN lost 2.5k so far someone please tell me something good
The good thing is that I didn't get caught in that pump and dump.
You have 5.5k if you sell now. GZ
it has begun. the resurrection
get out before you lose the other 5.5 bud
you can recover 5.5k. thats good right?
Sell covered calls against your shares at a strike price that you wouldn’t mind having them called away at. IV is pretty high and that stock is a turd, seems like it can’t go tits up.
VXX at 52 week lows, SPY at ATH. 🍿

Buy some 465 as a hedge
It's already a hedge but I guess I could hedge this too. Lmao
To shreds, you say?
Yes
Are you expecting a rate hike?
Expecting some tantrum around tapering.
If I've learned anything, It's all priced in.
Probably fair. It's a hedge for the rest of my portfolio.
That confident huh?
It's kind of a hedge against the rest of my port, but can see upside if everything tanks
Those are like 5 bucks a piece haha. It's not that expensive.
How ya feeling bud?
Definitely less great!
show me ur yield curve no homo
Made so many moves to just end up in a worse position than a week ago if I did nothing
Amazing was up $600 now down $80 😂 gotta love it

I have puts and calls, so I can double lose

Zillow's next  business strategy: liquidating for profits.
If the government had only bought Z puts, they could’ve funded their build back better plan.
Nancy did. Guaranteed.
remember, the first big move is a fake out unless its not.
Ok, JPow.  I'm lubbed up.  Do what you need to do and let's get on with our days.

WTF, did jpow say that they are printing more money or something?
Just fucking lol I don’t even know what to do right now holy fuck

All algos see is “Breaking News” and they press Buy
there is no Sell button in JPOW world.. press Buy or hold.

JPOWELL HAS PAPER HANDS - ALL MY CALLS ARE PRINTING---- THANK YOU JDADDY

He's reading the same speech as last time.

We're still going to be calling inflation "transitory" in 12 months when SPY is at 700.
CNBC, hire someone who knows how to ask a question in one sentence.
Jerome: “the fuck you ask. Make it quick, dude.”
Contrary to popular belief, tapering was not priced in. What wasn't known was that tapering had become a bullish catalyst

Transitory means…in the end we’re all dead. I mean, what’s the point of anything?

You might say the definition of transitory is transitory? Very meta…Facebook, Meta…..Meta to the moon!
I love to fuck bear asshole.

This market so broken lmfao but I'll take my free money
I fought Jerome and Jerome won.
Holy shit we are going to be so fucking green the rest of the week.
The market is going 🥜
So the Fed wont tackle inflation until we hit max employment and we wont know what full employment looks like until the middlebof next year? Im gonna buy some calls.
How about bofa deez nuts
lol bears ded
Okay spy getting a bit outrageous
SPY: “Look at me…I am the meme now”
"Elon, I don't think this bubble can get much bigger"

"Nonsense!"

Maximum Employment is the new transitory. He’s found his new favorite words.
Thinking of getting a big "J" tramp stamp tatood, "P" on the left  cheek "W" on the right cheek
imagine being a bear in the midst of the greatest bull run in world history. the government is giving investors literal free money, and you're sitting on the sidelines. schmucks!
Giving free money until that 1 day, when you lose it all 😁 Not a bear, but just giving a reality check 😃
[deleted]
You’re kidding right? What he said wasn’t bullish by any means.
He basically said don’t worry we will sort it out. Have fun till then
Wasn’t bearish either
He said no raise in interest rates until full employment and he wont know what that looks like til the middle of next year. That is bullish.
It didn't have to be.  Too good means rates rise and that tanks the market.
Bears do so much math and analysis to just be wrong all the time
Ironic they don't do the math on how stupid they are
Very normal, very sustainable.

“no tapering, we printing more money boys!!! What’s the worst they can do, fire me?”

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Theoretically, why can’t we kick the can forever? At least until we’re all dead ya know?
Depends how old you are. Boomers are extremely good at doing shit that benefits them and then dying before they have to deal with the consequences.
That's what JPOW is trying to figure out, too.
as long as wages rise to compensate. if they don't, and inflation gets high, no one will buy anything and well go into a recession like in the seventies.
I was thinking the same thing. If we have a debt based economy essentially, why wouldn’t they just lean in heavy and lend shit tons of money out to build new technology and infrastructure. I feel like we have yet to build ghost cities to spoof our gdp like China. Maybe that’s the next step just massive deficits to throw gobs of money at infrastructure and crazy space stations and shit.

If I only tried to make 200 a day trading my story would be so different. lol
$200 a day average is a fuck ton of money...
It’s $52k a year without accounting for holidays… idk if that’s a fuck-ton
Dirty peasant here, that's a ton of money in addition to normal income.
Considering the average idiot here has a $10k account, that's basically impossible.  Now maybe if you're good with a $250k account, that's possible, but still unlikely. I target about 1-1.25% per month

I wish I could call in sick and stare at OCGN today. Another rug pull would really exacerbate my boneitis.

The market is down but my portfolio is spilling over with green dildos.
Picked up an OCGN leap for next Spring, (should be able to sell during the winter COVID peak when their vaccine is in hot demand).
Should be gold at some point.
If anyone is buying Zillow after these news I honestly admire your level of retardness

Honestly it is pretty fucking baller that puts on GME within any timeframe is mostly always useless
No push them out 1 month and once it falls back to 180 you cash out
The higher it goes the slower it bleeds and the higher the IV, last small spike took over 1.5 months to see a 40 point drop. Timing the purchase and getting the correct expiration is basically playing Russian roulette with a 9mm
Is that how all puts are anyway? You can get 2 month put at 200 from here and be assured of profit
You’d absolutely lose money on that play and no all outs aren’t like that because not every option chain has to account in for potential 200% moves every other day lmao
I mean I don't care either way I have shares so I don't need to gamble on options but I seen people do well on puts for GME timing them out a month or 2 that is without mentioning it is entirely possible it can flash crash like it did during January 

You can profit in puts your timing is just shit
Train to 300 is at the station choochooo
I WON MY BAN BET. LETS GOOOO
Keep $LCID on watch 👀
Not watch buy. It came off support 40 is my new target
yes i agree 👍🏻
Market has gone full retard lately. Holy shit, just buy a call and wait for a 10 bagger it seems to be that easy.

Seriously though. I was excited for anew update, but like, now I can't even find what tickers I'm invested in. Looks new and stuff, but horribly inefficient to use.

I don’t understand this. Manchin was just on tv yesterday saying he didn’t want anything to do w this stuff
It’s all a stunt to take eyes off what happened in Virginia it won’t happen. I don’t like Pelosi, but she may be one of the best there is at playing politics.
What happened in Virginia is big
Completely agree. She has to get people talking about something else quickly

Ooh can I be one of them?
I do
Watch volume on 1200c spike as soon as TSLA touches green 🤡🤡
Jokes on you, no mo green today
Ok, I thought it was going to be Meme day but I guess it was just Meme first hour.
The same formula as always. Shorts got screwed on Avis and bed bath needed some liquidity sump pump and dump and sell the premium on all the memes and then take that cash go back and short the original stocks some more
The market is surprisingly not reeing as much as I would have expected going into a likely JPow taper announcement. Is the taper already pRicEd iN?
You haven’t seen what the market does before these meetings. Currently movement is bearish AF to me. Not doing anything until EOD.
$15 billion taper is priced in I think if its more then we going down. 

If its only $15 billion it means we will have many many billions still entering the market for many months.
Sold AMZN calls right at the bottom omfg
I wonder how is NKLA is still not bankrupt?

There is no doubt in my mind that Kathy Wood is on here. Only an autist of the grandest stature would continue to buy Zillow. Truly an inspiration to all retards

Does Zillow have a bottom? And didn't Cathy Woods buy this before earnings? Oh man..
Market experts and economists widely expect the Federal Reserve to start tapering either in November or in December, at a speed of about $10b less in treasuries and $5b less in mortgage-backed securities per month.

The stock SuperBowl begins in 3 minutes
Isn’t it at 11:30 ?
Green! LFG
 Beginning later this month, the Committee will increase its holdings of  
Treasury securities by at least $70 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed  
securities by at least $35 billion per month. Beginning in December, the Committee  
will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $60 billion per month and  
of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $30 billion per month. The  
Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely  
be appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if  
warranted by changes in the economic outlook. The Federal Reserve’s ongoing  
purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market  
functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of  
credit to households and businesses.
I see this as good

ahh thank god, taper was priced in
We’ll hear today that the fed will do exactly what JPOW said the fed would do, and yet still markets are going wild
LOL so you're saying the market didn't give two shits about tapering? shocker!
So, you’re tellin’ me this movement was caused by the FOMC theme music they got goin’ on right now?
I only listen to FOMC for their theme music, it is always good

Not as good as the Economic Club meetings, but very close

Idk I hope so but I was expecting a lot more positive press from owners first reviews and it seems like they got pushed down the list in the media, lazy googling just shows they took delivery you gotta dig for anything else. Should be bigger news IMO
OCGN turning it up in premarket, gonna be a crazy day.
It will go up right away then down then back up probably. Hoping for it to end at about 17 today
Maybe 18

It’s looking great, but judging from your spam replies, am guessing it’s not going too good for you :)

R u serious? 

Y do u wanna buy at the top
I bought into one ticker in particular with low mkt cap and has a lot of room to grow compared to inflated peers. I’m going to stick with it, just frustrating in general.

If I bought spy calls or memes I’d be sweating
The top is in December-Jan not right now
As Musk’s wealth rises, he is now worth more than several automotive companies combined.

How far down we think Zillow is bleeding today
Hopefully it bleeds out
I’m going to short it at open, try and make a quick small profit out of it, after a couple of days I’m gonna take a long position out on it as long term I reckon it will recover

BBBY is one example of how we're all at the mercy of the whales
Gme should gamma ramp with volume increase
this sell wall at 1190 for TSLA is really annoying

Everyone gotta have some gme
How the fuck is the market pumping right now
Only thing really popping off is memes this morning. Rest of the market is pretty neutral

At what time the powell dump?

closed out of my gme call, 10x was good enough for me, I hope my prudence unshackles our beloved icarus to truly soar to the heavens
Keep running Sofi
Hoping BB gets a boost from ticker mix ups with BBBY.
Loving $SOFI. I also just bought $25 Jan 22 on $OPEN. This sympathy dip is exaggerated and think they crush ER

Edit: timed those leaps perfect at $21.3, flying past $22 on OPEN! LFG
with everything squeezing and CLOV Earnings Monday last time had awesome 140% growth CLOV time is upon us.
Alright post the loss porn I know a fuck load of you FOMOd at 250
The market is giving out nice after halloween treat bags today i see
Welp, all my money is in the market and im day trade restricted so i guess its time to get some work done...

So much for being cash gang through FOMC lmao
It’s so hard to stay on the sidelines
Couldnt stay away from that SKLZ premarket with earnings today

I hope they dont fuck me lol
Sell before earnings if you’re up?
Day trade restricted, gotta ride or die by earnings 🙃
LCID going again
Outperform rest of ev spaces 🚀🚀
Why do I feel like spy is going to have liquid shits  any minute now?
I don't care where it goes as long as this sideways shit ends. I'm fucking bored.
Gme did me well when I held back in Jan. I'm gonna hold my call

My guess is $25 when the Rivian IPO drops. They have a good-sized investment in them.
IS there a bottom on PayPal though?
garbage company. Only companies that sell physical games in an age of online purchasing and movie theatre companies in the age of streaming are worth anything anymore.
I hope so ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
If BB could stop making me feel like a complete cuck that’d be great.
feels good to be cash gang today
Feels good to be making money today
i did that this morning too, good feels all around
It never feels good to be cash gang
OCGN slammed into the earth on that approval.

If it ain't FDA it doesn't mean shit
We don’t need OCGN product in the USA. We have better vaccines. But they only have like a 2 week shelf life. 

This vaccine is for poorer countries with way bigger populations that the USA. It has a 12 month shelf life.
That's my point. Nobody giving a shit about things FDA does not care about
Ocgn owners didn’t know about the sell the news Shit common this past yr in bio
Only difference between BB AMC and GME is IV, and BB is the lowest, so I'm in on BB 1/21 20c lfgoooooooooooo
Too far bruh, 11/5
I’m wrong more than I am right in this shit but the ability to cut your losses and let your winners run means I’m way up on the year (still a thousand down all time but that was 10k so I am definitely catching up) my point is. Just admit when you’re wrong and this game isn’t hard to make money at.
Stop losses for the win
PLTR putting ip the good fight.

COME ON PAPA CHEN
Fucking Birds IPO so over priced
so are their shoes
Wtf is an ALLBIRD
It's a shoe company, they make decent plain walking around shoes. I'm actually wearing them now
Dont forget to mention no one has heard of your favorite band and you are also vegan
If there’s a cliche lifestyle attached to this shoe then I'm unfamiliar. I just wanted something comfortable that I could get away with wearing at the office
its whats in your mouth
Excellent shoes. /S
FED is not going to change anything. Let's get that out there and move on
They are going to cut back on asset purchases and give a tighter time-line for rate hikes

Thanks 🙏🏼
2 hours and 25 min
Shorts are feasting in PayPal. 

Like holy hell how does it keep on dumping?
nobody’s shorting PayPal lol
It's down to 226. Do you think it's people just dumping stock over nothing?
it’s a bear trap/shaking out weak hands, you’ll see when big money comes in, just wait for earnings
I bought a hundred shares at 252. Lol.

I did just buy another 15 though. Hopefully you're right.
It's gonna rocket after FED meeting
because they know I am a bag holder and they like to fuck me personally
Why do I overthink things and buy stocks that aren't AMD and Tesla
AMD is the tits.
AMD optiona have treated me well
zillow better get delisted
GME you damn tease...
OCGN needs to go back up
I don’t even want to bother unloading my calls. Just going to go down with the ship I guess.
Please stop! I'm already dead
Fucking GUH I’m gonna throw up

JPow just finished busting a nut At Wendy’s he heading back to the office
i noticed a little extra mayo on the burgers

I thought I was the only one that did that. Mine is laser sounds.
Picked up 2000 shares bbby few days ago, sold at $29.50 after hours for a $30k profit. My first big win. I'll probably lose it faster than I gained it though.

TSLA just gained $26B in market cap (1.6 Zillows) in 5 minutes on nothing.
Ya it's a Trillion $ company. Zillow plays in the sandbox.
I’m so down bad bro
And ocugen has created a new generation of bag holders. The stocks giveth to some, and take from many. Trudge on retards.
There are 3 more good news on the way soon so they might baghold for a month. But if you bought at original DD $9 youd be up 50% still
Meme stonk rug pull lol
2 hours until 3 holes filled gang bang by fed

How would the stock market react to a POTUS death by covid? Has that ever happened
Has the POTUS died from Covid before is what you are asking? Is that not what got Garfield??
Considering covid didn't exist until Fauci made it in China, no it's never happened
Has POTUS ever died to COVID? I dunno, I mean we've had 18 other versions of it, right? It's possible one died to like Covid-2.
> No.

IDK why people are buying ATVI on "the dip".  The stock tanked for a reason.  Q4 looks grim.  They have the new CoD and candy crush.  The entire blizzard half of the company is in shambles right now with zero positive outlook for the next 2 quarters.
Major vaccine approval news. Sp drops 5 dollars. Makes sense.
It does not impact their sales you fucking ape
But it will dumbass
So everyone is waiting for the fed chair to say what he's been saying for months...

Got it.
It's now or December, if it's not now, the bulls get another run until December
Markets think he’s bluffing they want the drugs to last forever
Zillow spelt backwards: **Zero**
I think SPY sill dump, logically, the rest of you should buy calls
i just came back from jpow's bedroom (don't ask). you guys are in for a HUGE surprise
He's Yellen in a corset and tentacles?
Why did Robinhood put the about section first now when looking at a ticker.. like who needs to know that over the statistics..?
Apes lol
that’s right 😋
Only 14M volume on SPY by 1pm. If i was JPOW my dick would be throbbing at the power he wields
Why do I even bother looking at tickets between 10:30 and 2?
All you really need is to be in here to get a market sentiment
SPY puts or calls before the taper announcement? What time is it at?
2:30 EST
Yes

Don’t worry. You’ll get another chance.
I regret it too
CLF down for 6 straight days. RIP call holders.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
That fake pump this morning
CLF... I remember that one. Bought at 30, it went to 90, held for 6% div. Tanked to single digits and cut divy... 

That acronym makes me sad :(
I’ve been averaging down my 11/19s for four straight days ugh
kinda figured something out.  When an anomaly like Avis happens, it causes a bunch of Yolo'ers to become horny and in acts of FOMO desperation they start pumping the other meme stocks.  So the next time some shit like CAR happens, look for gaymestop or AMC to follow
“Hedge fund managers hate him”
look, it's happened 1 out of 1 times that I've paid attention.  If that's not a pattern I don't know what is
This is actually a decent theory.
Yah, has nothing to do with actual EPS being double estimates after having shit for earnings for years. Maybe Avis is the next Enron? Who knows, stop trying to make NovemBEAR happen.
Expect coordinated CLOV spam tonight
Someone tell me why I shouldn't buy PTON puts before earnings? I feel like people are sick of riding a fucking bike in their basements and have canceled their pton memberships.
> You should buy pton puts before earnings.
i dunno, winter is on the way and it's way easier to work out at home than it is to drag yourself to the gym
This would just be an earnings play on last quarter.
well i think at earnings they also discuss future plans no? how they expect to maintain growth etc etc? im not invested in it either way just shootin the shit
That's correct, but if they adjust their Q4 guidance lower, the stock price could dump.. that's what I'm hoping for at least.
good luck to ya then! on a personal note i kinda hate the pelotons and their fitness as a service model so i hope those puts print for ya
It's too obvious
Why would people buy OCGN after it goes up 100% in 5 days pricing in the potential good news, making it so if there isn’t any it will tank. Why?
Lol Z poots for sure...
Only DD you need for BIRD is that my wife's boyfriend said they are really comfy.
Nasdaq don't give a damn about the FED speech
All in SPY & GME fds, can’t tits
Is it dumb to buy a 340c lotto for GME if the theta is -162
I wouldn’t think too hard about it, do what you feel
Thanks 🙏🏼

Z already down 24%. If taper announcement is worse than expected, that would be the knockout blow lol.

I have $178,800 worth of SPY in my Robinhood and my average cost is $420.69.

I will give RH charts credit, they make a $.30 drop look like the market crashed. Exciting stuff…

Bad news, time for an ATH
I almost loaded up spy puts today but then i remembered how i wanted to buy calls for 500 last week.
I told guys, buying puts would be too fucking obvious. I glad I held my calls.
Volatility Indexes just hit the fucking dirt
As soon as my order on spy puts get filled, massive green dildo. You're welcome
Maybe you're wrong about the catalyst. But at least we're at ATH so some general volatility/cooling down can make you some $$$.

He's not going to say anything new.  They release the minutes from the FOMC meeting at 2pm.
That was the fucking craziest shake up man, I need a drink

It picked a direction: right
Sketch that NYT had that article at the ready. FOMC hadn’t even uploaded their meeting info yet.

bears: obviously the market will tank

how do you play spy options
Go to trade options and buy SPY $600c 11/5
In or at the money, either way, at least a week out the minute before market close. What I’ve found is even if it goes tits up, at some point I can get out at least at break even

Fuuuuck, I dumped my SPY call thinking the market was going to bear. That's what I get for betting against JPow.
"well........ uhhhhhh....... because reasons bro.... why you tryin to salt this rally?"
I think this is the most bullish the market has been since Feb 2020.  Nothing seems to matter just infinite buying at all time highs.  We’ll see where that goes.
SPY is the new TSLA
>Nothing seems to matter just infinite buying at all time highs.  We’ll see where that goes.

It's as easy as:

  
Find ticker that has dropped 15% overnight.

Try and see if there's news that could continue to fuck it.

If not, buy some OTM calls a few months out.  


Did this on ATVI today - it's barely moved and I'm up 20%.
VZIO prime candidate
Only down 5% over the last month so I'd skip for calls a few months out.

Down 30% over 6 months - for that reason, I'd buy LEAPS with confidence.
Bam bitches! Tsla new ath!!!
Lol we live in a world where a 40 dollar move in TSLA is only 3%

You’re in it bro!
Do we have any expectations on how high it'll go?
Damn straight I do. The last time we saw volume like this was one day in June, and a three or four day rush in May. I feel safe saying that this could go on a rise at least for 24 to 48 hours unless this is actually the MOASS, then all bets are off on how long it goes for.

Yeah, it’s pretty apparent at this point that she’s fucking retarded and just got lucky during the post covid everything goes up rally.
Yeah just buying all
Big “innovative” tech and fintech
Ocgn WHO approved!!!
800 shares Gamestop @ 150 cost

2000 shares OCGN @ 11.70 cost

Legggggggggggggggggo
Legos
🐋🐳 🚨
Similar positions to you. What’s your PT
GME = 🌕

OCGN = sell 80% at $40-50 and ride the wave for the remaining.  This has Brooklyn Immuno written all over it when it spiked $8 to $50.
Time to FOMO into GME if you haven’t already. Just 1 share won’t hurt. Then DRS that share!
This is da WAY ⬆️
GME is helping everyone fight inflation today. lets get these tendies
Just bought a Tesla put so it’s going 1200 in a sec. Yw boys
$1200-$1250 to finish the week
ME TOO, im holding 50k in POOTS

How the hell do you lose 30% on shares in a day
[deleted]
It will spike up again eventually in a few months. But yeah, you going to be bag holding for a while
Y would u do dat
I bought like 1.100 shares though
LOL
Sell CCs on them at the strike just above your cost basis. The only thing you’ll lose is the time you could be in something else.
[deleted]
Yeah but if you keep selling them every week you can put those gains toward something else. 0DTE SPX took $150 to $2,800 for me once a couple months back.
SPY is buying 100,000 Teslas!!!

AMD and GME. what a beautiful day
Bought gme calls when it was at 248. I’m a fucking moron lmao no choice but to hold now
Good luck I did the same and took the L , switched to puts for the day.
Will pick u up soon, hope you bought more than 2 days though
Yeah I'm gonna need you to sell those so it can go back up

Regularly scheduled institutional dump coming today when their algos receive fed news at noon ? Buying opportunity incoming with red?
Where do you see BBBY stock price going to today pigs?
26m shares short only 2.9mil volume so far ,it could run
Watch today be a face ripper green because MMs know all you bears bought puts for FOMC
I in fact should have sold all those puts on OCGN for that sweet premium yesterday ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
> I'm not sure what you're talking about.
Then shut your mouth VisualMod!
That's exactly what I did. Sold a couple 13p
Im gonna see if its volatile at open and try and snake some
> It is.
You're going to buy them?
No im gonna theta gang the shit out of people
> This is a good idea.
FOMC notes will be dropped at 2 or 2:30 EST?
230
Right in time to drill
Hopfully numbers are bad so the market soars
We are having supply chain issues from excessive demand but someone just argued with me that you fix this by stimulating more demand
Maybe if we demand more supply?
Well, the longer the line of demand for something, the more economically feasible it becomes to increase output. So, they’re not totally wrong.

If there are 4 years worth of orders for an item, as opposed to 4 months, it suddenly makes a lot more sense to expand production.
This was a good point that I didn’t think of.
Yeahhhhh.. but it’s all circular. You can pretty much argue anything economically because it’s all such a jumbled mess 😂
hand meet someones face
Still holding 150/1000 shares of OCGN from December shoulda Leaped this bihhh

Viking horn for opening bell sounds like a good idea too

Spy 500, Tsla 1500

Raise your hand if you bought AMC because of the stupid fucking Earnings Whisper calendar fuckup.
Bought CAR puts too early yesterday, got IV crushed
What time avoids IV
OPEN THE CASINO!!!
Fat red candle on OCGN
As is tradition. Let it ride
Oooof ocgn
🚀🚀🚀🚀 LETS GO
Typically sell the news is good advice. Let’s see how this pans out for OCGN.
wait wait wait OCGN? whats goin on baby?

How did those Zillow puts workout for everyone here?
I bought calls. Lost my life savings
F
Blood Bath & Beyond xD
If you still make Investing decisions based off fundamentals and not momentum we’d all enjoy seeing your loss porn.
jfc OCGN waited long enough to tweet about WHO approval. That should have been scheduled for 9:25.
Won that ban bet in 15 minutes lol. If GME breaks and holds $233 I'll be mind blown
I hope the dems are forced to roll out federal MJ legalisation to save their party. 

My US weed and TLRY stocks are bleeeeding
Earlier in the week: I’ll sell some CC’s for $240 and $245 GME, because there’s no way it hits those numbers by the 12th. Opens etrade app today; Jesus fuckin Christ.
Gme doin its thing I guess.
CAR going to drop hard today
picked up 10 of each all for 11/5 Z 65p GME 250c and SPY 463c
Give me +50% day trade
Spy really getting pinned until JPOW speaks huh
You can turn off your screen and come back at 2 pm, spy will be at 461.30. 

It is gonna do swings within 50 cent range whole day until fed talk.
The problem with being a bear is that it's not like you can just be wrong when the market doesn't crash.
  
Instead the market runs 7% in three weeks without a single meaningful red day, pegging the RSIs on every timeline along the way, so it's like you're 5x wrong.

Oh yeah!
Woah
How low will she go!
**Zillow**
Let the FOMO flow
That GME volume already 3,3m
Are ya squeezin’ son?
300 eod for gme !!
GAMMA SQUUEZE ME!!!
God I really fucked myself with Zillow. Bought at the peak at $102, averaged down yesterday, loaded more after the earnings to wake up to it being around $70. 

Please, my asshole can only take so much 😢
Tough luck, I’m all out of spit
I know how you feel, I lost a shit ton on PayPal.
$BB up over 8% too...been holding forever in the deep red. Do I finally get back to black?
The shitty thing with BB is that it's actually a quality stock that only moves with GME. Its value should be double from here, even without the meme value, but it just doesn't move
Ok now I understand, it was a bull trap. Thank you Stock Market! Very cool.
Holy buckets my gme fd is up a lot
LETS GO GME
Not gonna feel quite the same until I get an old fashioned GME halt
rock fucking hard GMEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Meh… GME… rookie numbers…
BB go brrrrrrr
Come on BB🍇! I need extraction @ $19🚀🚀
**sets BB sell limit to $19.80 to avoid missing out on meme intra-day-dildo spike**

Time to learn about IV crush 🤡
Hey Siri, Play Can’t Stop Won’t Stop by GME 🚀
Anyone understand why c r y p to is inverse of GME?
Because people need to move money between both 😁😁
*Spiderman meme of GME and coin buyers pointing at each other*
Inverse of meme stocks I’d say.  
Well the coins can actually be the biggest bubble, many funds maybe are using them for leverage and pumping these. Dump when in need of liquidity?
FOMO. ppl buy the top, and then sell the bottom, then move on to the next thing that's moving quickly.
Yes
Who woke up FIGS
I tried to buy a call for it yesterday but it never placed pretty mad about it
F
50% on Z puts in 15 min. LFG
Morning dump has ended, we rise from the ashes now boys.
Moment of truth for TSLA
amc go to $50 pls
People are so quick to cry about the dip here it’s sad. Grow a sack
Here we go again. Good Morning Everyone!
This does bring a tear to my eye😭 GAMESTORE UR BACKKKK![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
GME holds VWAP and how has to choose between making a decisive move up past R2 ($248) towards $270 or a decisive move down past VWAP back to $233 or $225 (maybe even $212).
Where's that autist on here that said to buy FIGS last Friday. I love you.
Hoping bb hits 20 today, been holding this for too long
keep hoping
At this point it’s gonna close red, looks like a bull trap
Why are OCGN contract 3x the price of SOFI? MM’s know it’s gonna rip that why. Demand is high af. Shorts losing the battle.
Gus Johnson needs to be here just screaming

Lol, this shit is nonsensical
How do I disable the red when my RH is negative??
Change color scheme
found it thanks, now it’s all pink, makes me feel warm inside while I watch my life savings dwindle away
Can I get an award for this being the first week in months I didn’t sell CC’s of GME for $200 strike price .
Market nov -> jan shaping up to be like a fever dream again, is this going to be a yearly thing from now on ?
June was like this too tbh

Soon may the tendieman come!  BB c'mon I need these 11/5 15c weeklies to print
I sold 16s, stay under
So happy to see BBBY and GME pamping. 

Let's go!
ATVI calls are on the menu
I’m interested but the fact that so many people on WSB are buying the dip makes me believe it’s going to bleed further
I really want 70C 1/21. I swung them 10 mins ago for 1300 profit
let it drop another 20% its got more room to drop
Care to enlighten me why it’s down 15%

Alright I'm out of my Z trade. GL to everyone else holding.
Good call. It’s likely going to keep tanking. They admitted two major parts of their business model were flawed. The zestimsate and home buying.
took a fat loss pre market on the bump, I really don’t see how they are going to make money cause they started the home flipping for a turnaround as their ad business was dying
V, you can start that recovery any time now.
Wow old youngkin won VA
VA voters are never happy with the current party at any given moment
I never understood why they renominated someone from the old boys club. Dems stupid so often

Fb 2dte 350c 11/05 should i yolo?
Sold my F 18c and rolled out the profits to 19c 11/5. Mama didn't raise no bitch. Shits gunna add another dollar on there after no taper and white house confirming EV tax credit by eow.
I can't believe VISA is whats gonna cause me to lose so much money
Same here. I was not expecting it to keep on drilling like this. Ridiculous
surprised hedge funds haven’t loaded the fuck up, maybe trying to trap the bears under the long term trend line, who knows
Haha Cramer just called WSB communists

You bought at the top what did u expect fucking idiot
Sounds like you expect people to know exactly when the top is everytime if I knew that I wouldn’t have bought it tf
lol how dumb are you? do you know how to read graphs??
So you can read graphs and your able to see when the top is every single time? You must be rich? Was trying to be nice af first but you sound like a fucking moron. Fucking dickhead too
> I am rich. I'm not an idiot.
 Tsla jumps a cliff
Jumped with cathy woods
the bulls have gotten fat and tired. bears are taking over
🐻 we r back
Then why aren't they selling?
I can't decide if I would rather buy LEAPs on PYPL or V. 

Either way I'm waiting till after PYPL's earnings.
I’ve personally got visa

They’re retarded.
I remember when people were buying houses in NJ and CT based off of Zoom tours. Earlier this year. Truly unbelievable when you look back on it.
I can’t believe people would actually want to live in those states

Edit: I grew up in one of the listed states absolute shit holes
Doubt they wanna live there but a 5 bedroom house in CT could be had for what a 1 bedroom house in California is worth
Depends where. SW CT is probably the richest place on Earth.
Every state has its rich areas
Sure. But CT, NJ and some NY counties are the bedroom communities for NYC wealth. Greenwich alone has more billionaires than most countries.
Pretty sure CT also has some shit neighborhoods with houses for like $1300 a month mortgage lol
Maybe but I would not want to live in Cali either
East coast is garbage unless you’re at the beach
Because zoom totally showcased the foundation problems and busted pipes and methed out neighbors 🤦‍♂️

Edit: zoom tours
Some old guy (I mean older than me like 85) did that.  Lived in NJ paid $200K cash for a place in Virginia.  Got there to move in and called broker the first day, "hey this place sucks it's nothing like the pictures".  I want my $$ back.  Broker of course said "no do over's dude it's yours now."

Old man pulls a gun kills the broker and then himself.

No one cares if you were wrong when the market is green. Everyone cares when they get rheir ass gaped by unexpected red. Face saving bums know there won't be a dip
My only regret is not buying more Zillow puts yesterday.
Spy being red is against the US constitution
Is there any chance a taper announcement doesn't immediately tank the market? 0 dte puts are incredibly cheap
Last time it was a big tank then pump. Hard to time it
Cheap but also could take a big L on them
cheap because people will buy them cheap with your thinking and then they'll expire worthless at EOD when *surprise surprise* powell doesn't make tapering comments and the "market liked his lack of commentary"

Cause bears are sirens calling for your destruction with beautiful promises of insane gains from a market crash.

Only on a major reversal.
You're not that guy, PayPal.

What stock should you buy if you catch a rat coming out of a toilet in NYC
$WISH
If JPow misses, we'll get an even bigger dove as FED chair. Meaning stocks will go up even higher.

If JPow delivers, we'll get a relief rally.

Basically to whatever happens, AAPL calls are the move imo. Lol
What call should I do ?
I won both Zillow and ATVI and they both crashed badly today. The good thing is I own shares so I can hold the bag forever.
Never have to worry about taxes GZ
Close my OCGN short?
$10-$11 EOD
AMZN been a turd for like a year
Gotta break out soon. 4000 leaps ?
They need to split their stock so more retail investors can buy their stock price prices out lots of retail.
Everyone thinks jpow is bringing the stocks down soon but it will be the opposite: literally every time stocks just go up. The algos already know the future so they do the exact opposite to ensure max pain and ensure max profits for them
Unless he learned he's getting canned!
Looks like no one is ever using electronic payments again. Totally makes sense V, MA, and Pypl have drilled.

Anyone following Cathie Wood on Zillow?

Cathie Wood’s Flagship ETF Buys More Zillow Shares Amid Steep Drop; ARK Investment fund bought 288,800 shares Tuesday, the day the real-estate company said it would exit the home-flipping business.
Following cathie woods might actually be the worst strategy to ever exist in the stock market

Never, .edu email addresses get you free student shit all the time
Pro tip of the day right here
I'm over a decade out still using that shit.
Spy isn't moving one way or another till JPOW giveth or taketh. Now is the time to do a straddle play and hope this MF pops or flops!!! 230 is gonna feel like a massive  bump of the white girl.
Everything on hold till JPOW...  buying more F now I think it will pop to $20
Gme 250 FDd seems like the play
Waiting for this conference is excruciating.
Learned a new word today: Monopsony. Instead of a monopoly where there is only one seller, in a Monopsony there is only one buyer. Sort of like Cathie Woods with Zillow.
Last line got me
A great example is amazon. They're not a true monopoly, but if you want to sell anything online, it's almost mandatory to sell via Amazon  so they're kind of a monopsony.
wait.... 0dte spy strangle?  The crickets are so loud, it can't end with a whimper today
Bad casino

My first ever trade was buying the (almost) exact bottom of AAL last year at 8.75
Z could get really ugly
god i hope it does
Will JPOW be crucify if aggressive tapering is announced? Will sleepy Joe nominate a new FED chair?!  Found out next time Wallstreetbet Z!
I refuse to believe in this dip
Someone needs to be an absolute chad and go balls deep on 0DTE SPY Puts at 1:59pm today.
Just found out i got $4k knocked off my college tuition bill a few weeks back due to the covid relief bill. So, yeah, im making gains today no matter what the market does fuck yeaaaaaaaah
How’d you get that relief bill
I have no idea, i just got my monthly payment bill in my email and wondered why the fuck it was $4k lighter
Fuck yea, profit🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽
My net worth is now less negative hell yeah!!
Fuckin bullshit. I better check mine lol
Yeah it was auto applied i didnt even do anything 🤷‍♂️

Considering the bill is 18 months old they must be pretty slow at rolling it out lmao
How badly z be run that in the middle of historic housing price boom they figured out how to suck so much.
Lol its hard to flip right now. With such inflated prices as well as no foreclosures. Before covid was best time to flip houses.
Another day where every move I make results in max losses.
When is Jerome spitting his bars?
5 minutes until the algos go crazy.
Very nervous. Holding 460 and 459 puts for 11/8
Gonna dump like they’re giving a Cleveland Steamer
This is gonna hurt isn't it
Not if buy F
Cathie Wood bought the crash on Zillow... I'm not sure what to think.
She’s holding the bag
cause she’s down 40%
#SPY TO THE MOON

GREEN DILDO

BEARS DIED
Get ready for the biggest, greenest hulk dick you've ever seen. Jpow will announce some weak ass interest rate tapering shit and the amount of priced in rocket fuel is gonna send the market to alpha centuari.
> I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question. Please rephrase it using correct English grammar and syntax.
lol, in WSB? lmfaooooooooo
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

BEARS GET FUCKED
very weak pump 

less than 1M SPY shares


market isn’t even close to digesting this
markets dont need to when algos do the pumping
this is quickly transitioning from fun to a little scary
The can has officially been kicked down the road, see you bears in 2023
The only thing I have done all day is stare at my phone smh
Saaaaaaame!
Boys I get being a bull is fun but what the fuck LMFAOO
Algos retarded 😂
Jpow hasn’t even spoken yet. What’s going on?
They released the minutes from the meeting.
They release the statement before he speaks
TRANSITORY
Spy middle finger pattern
So we tapering or not, make up your minds. Sheeesh!
We are. But the interest rate isn’t changing as well.
Guess I should have sold on that pump
Fuck it. i bought some friday calls on QQQ & SPY. this SHIT only goes up lmao. officially dump time
I did the exact opposite when the Nasdaq and s&p popped. Got lucky.
I appreciate your sacrifice.
Coin coming for y'all tards that bought at 400
**If you bought SPY calls before 1:30 just hold** 

**If you didn't wait till EOD and buy 11/12 calls 3-6 OTM**
PUTS*
K
Transitioning is transitory spy 7000 eod
can we do a taper every day?
Yes, Son.
You guys were drooling over OCGN all morning and now it's down almost -20%.
Not my calls, those are down 77%
Big number good
In at .25 beg of last year, sold 40 Cc for 10k today
So I forgot to cancel my limit order on SPY 11/10 puts before the meeting. My plan was to cancel at 1:45 if not filled. Oops.
amd 130. took a while
Gonna crack open a beer
Someone gonna need to hold SPY’s hair while she pukes in the club toilet pretty soon
Nobody worse then the lames holding up Zillow 🤡
JPOW Left a cinder block on the gas pedal
Welp this was literally the only thing on my radar of things that can tank the market. Time to get jacked to the "Texas Institute of Technology and Science" in calls
The fuck is this FED waiting room music so upbeat
Had a put, bought more puts, buying more puts
My SPY puts are suffocating me
No
Here we go...
I don’t think any fed chairman was ever as popular as powell. My dude is history

always sunny season 15 on December 1 let's go
Powell said y’all ain’t getting a used car for a good price any time soon
Hahaha this is so retarded.
Is he saying that he’s going to keep printing cause the economy is fine
Yes . Bears r fuk
He's saying the economy still needs support and inflation is good so we'll be accommodating still.
I am gay for Powell
Here come the questions trying to trip JPow up into tanking the market lol
LMAO the guy with the first question's face, he terrified of tapering
Powell is such a bullshitter
I need SPY above 465 tomorrow! let's GOOOOOOO
Same
#I MEAN DAMN WHAT WOULD JEROMEY ROMEY ROMEY ROME THINK

Thanks for not answering shit JPow

Answered all my questions. SPY 500 EOY
Green dildos for everyone
Each day SPY doesn't make a new ATH, JPow goes home sad.
Sad if true
JPOW: Watch me taper my giant dong to my leg while I jump right on into this printer
jerome talking to bears is hilarious
LOOOL sure that's why inflation is high cool cool. Fucking love it !!
Look at all those green candles.
Jpowell said fk the bears we going to ride this ship to jupiter
Can't believe I almost went cash gang fuck you bears lmao
If they change Powell we are FUCCKKEEDD
SPY really unchained, market was basically worried they would NOT taper
Now that we have a general time frame we’re golden. Plus he’s open to tapering the taper ❤️‍🔥
Printer go brrr
Ok well, SPY just said Fuk No Nut November.
From the windows to the walls
Oh yes use your tools

#FUCK DEM KIDS!
Money for everyone. Boy do i love merica
let's goOOOOOOoOOO
JPow in favor of cancel culture, calling for all bears to be cancelled.
This is going to be a fun power hour
Papa Powell lookin fine with that purple tie tho 😳😳😳
sqwad
The feds r pumpers
Some retards need to realize that tapering only means fed will print less money per month but that doesn't mean they will stop printing.  J Pow's printer still goes Brrr till next year.
ngl this is a bit scary. Even tho my 465 are up 120% 😬
Dam. Once this market is done for, what is my life gonna be.

To much fucking fun right now
up 220% on my calls today
Let's go spyyyy print those calls
Spy Bear see yall behind Wendys
Up 70% on my 11/19 480c's.  Sell now, or be a degenerate and keep holding?
Sell bro
Lol I got 11/19 470c and 475c
I’m up 88% on my 11/22 456c and I am holding out for 150%
JPOW needs to run for president
I'd vote for him
SPY just does not give a fuck rn
It’s so sad the rate of species extinction. I never thought I would see the bears die in real time, but that’s what happens when an entire species is gay.
JPow: "we care a lot about Americans and their increasing costs"

Also JPow: "we still need more Brrrr"
Power hour this bitch
Is it me or JPOW don't know what he's talking about
It's you.
SPY TO 1000.
Jerome up here talking about epidemiology while we refuse to raise rates even a little with inflation at these levels. What good does this do???

Imagine buying puts before a Powell stream thinking you're smart lmaoooooo
Why care about anything other than spy? My gosh haha
> I don't care about anything other than spy
I like only having one thing to keep track of
Netflix calls, tesla calls, spy calls printing

Jerome: “keep not working and slacking off and I’ll keep the good times going.”
If inflation is transitory, please tell me what products are going to be repriced downwardly in the near future. Used cars? Not sure where the new supply would come from since these are *used* cars, and the relevant companies have been in a bidding war for used car stock for over a year. Metals? Demand is high because we use metal, and that's not going to change. Seems sticky as fuck to me. Getting into clown territory.
Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

Milk, coffee you know the normal things they use to measure inflation….
Cool, except jpoww has singled out used cars for like a year.
But only poor people buy used cars
Who short tsla now?
HUGE GREEN DILDO I REPEAT HUGE GREEN DILDO
The printings will continue until inflation improves
How many times must we slaughter these bears! The market will NEVER go down… FOR ETERNITY
WSJ has an Opinion piece today that mentions that in no 20-year calendar period in the past century has the market produced a negative return, and only twice has it returned less than 5%
Jpow just sounds like a big ass ramble. No idea what the fuck he is saying.
He’s told to dance and he’s putting on the greatest show of his life. Now dance jpow dance hahaha!
Either does he.
the fuck is this economy reopening shit? its been open for over a year now
Well sold my tsla call literally ten seconds before the rocket. Your fucking welcome. I have next level talent for that shit
Tesla just hit gas.
Puts seemed like a slam dunk going into today. 

Whenever something like this occurs always do the opposite and you will win.
Puts were the most retarded thing you could have done. It was beyond obvious to hold calls
or just look at what happened in the past. tapering happened b4, and the exact same thing happened.
Sometimes I just want to YOLO my entire IRA into TQQQ.

Ber is sad someone play them some blues tunes
Bears get fukt t JPow
I guess I should just stop the bleeding and sell these puts. They’re all down by ~60% but losing that remaining 40% would hurt. Kill me
Sell
[deleted]
yep. Just want at least a small fucking pullback, give me 463.50 or something for fucks sake
JPow has no comment on his future
If you want a $TSLA ber to have a heart attack, remind him of the stock-split ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
If you want to feel nostalgic, use Etrade. Their shitty user interface reminds me of 1997.
It's better than Interactive Brokers though. That thing looks prehistoric
Gotta use power etrade bro
cant be worse than interactive broker's tws. that shit is trash
I only started trading a few months ago and I didn't know which broker to use so I just picked Etrade. It's so goddamn ugly lol
Spy give me 470 EOW
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
talk about a power hour, holy shit
Powell hour
Man it just won’t stop going up.
Bought in nice and high on BBBY.... SHIT.
TSLA might make up for my day trading fucking losses
I like to see if I can make more money trading in a day than I can working. It's not hard, I don't make a lot of money.

Jerome and I are shower buddies (nothing sexual) and he told me he’s gonna pump today. Can’t wait until our post speech shower for some more insider info (again, nothing sexual)
You really expect people to believe that JPow showers twice a day?
He was talking about you, you missed the innuendo about him giving you something in your endo

Yeah right

I fell bad for the 25% of workers who will lose their jobs to inept leadership at Zillow, but can’t say I’m mad that the company is falling apart. They muddled the market for average home buyers trying to buy houses.
But they are selling their house stock to institutional buyers, so it won’t help much.

Wish I could do this. Would gladly skip lunch to dip out early.

Go Federal Reserve YouTube channel. Background music rn.
Where you buying your milk? 

It’s under $3/gallon here
I think that went over your head almost as high as inflation will be soon.
Ffs, how is this bullish at all.
I don’t fucking understand it
It's dovish which is what is should
Seems like u aren’t knowledgeable about the topic of  Retard knowledge
Simple: the market hates uncertainty and uncertainty just dropped significantly. Capital will remain elevated, rates don't have a reason to shoot way up, and action on tapering will have almost no effect on inflation but most people are ignorant about macroeconomics and that includes many fund managers and fiscal advisors who mistake their ideological presumptions for hard economics... they're monetary policy hawks and they see this as a true response to inflation even if it's less than they want.
Red days are now illegal.

OCGN will break bearish from this pattern. Shorts will sell their shares at the end of the pendant pattern to force a break downwards. It will fight. Sometime around noon it will reverse into the $17’s again and then rockets from there. Every time. Break down from pattern. Struggle. Rocket up. Every single time.
100%. Been patient with this one for awhile
GME TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀
JPOW got to walk a microscopic fine line today.

No taper = JPOW is disconnected from the market

Small taper = printer on, jpow job at risk

Moderate taper = printer off and bond dump market crash, JPOW gone and rate hike coming

Aggressive taper = bond dump, market crash Jpow gone and rate hike coming
JPOW doesn’t walk lines, he does then

printer on 🚀
His job is at serious risk regardless because of the whole trading thing

OCGN down 20% on the best news it’s had since IPO … markets are fake lol. Remember AMD earnings and it dipped after? Everyone was like “huh”? Now it’s almost $130. 

The dips. Are. Fake.
I’m holding lol idgaf. OCGN to the moon and the haters can suck my dick.
Im pretty sure hedges manipulate good news to push everyone else out of the lower best positions, then they let it proper skyrocket
The price has doubled in a month…?

I keep eyeballing costco from across the room but too scared to whip it out and go balls deep
I think Pow is wearing one of those long lasting rubbers
It's ribbed and he turned it inside-out for HIS pleasure.
how likely is SOFI $100 by 2024?
I wish it would join the memes and stay 4-5x its actual value. Looking at your AMC/GME/DWAC
I like how you think those stocks are only 4-5x their actual value.
yea not enough shorts, i hope it meme to $100 so i can finally afford a meal at costco
Sorry, this one’s actually worth something as a business
I think it is too, but it started as a SPAC and snake oil salesman Chamath. I don't have high hopes for it looking at how the rest of his turned out. Still if you can ride one good wave and profit its worth it in the long run
Don't know that expect 35 EOY

yeah probably should've gotten then 12 but oh well. i figure i'll buy the 13 and then the 14 or whatever they call it next year and then from then on out trade in the 2 year old phone for the lower price on the new one and keep the 1 year old phone as a burner

Shorted 300 shares of $z here at $75 (stop set at $77) on this dead cat bounce! Die Zillow...
my puuuuuttttssss
It was over 90 when the news came out. That was the short signal
Was at $99 when I came across the news, but didn't know it was gonna shit the bed! I expect more selling over next few weeks...
Lets see how Zillow and BBBY impact the market today.
Very little on both. They aren't Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc..
Maybe you’re right, but the simultaneous upward pressure the announced buyback had on multiple stocks supports the derivatives basket, swap theory
Looks like I picked the wrong week to play TSLA weeklies.
Her titties were bigger than mungers eyes
That's humungerous!!
Lucky bastard
If your favorite small cap is borrowing aggressively right now let's just hope their debt remains serviceable.
I believe it was mentioned that tapering is not tied to an interest rate hike, but I may be wrong?
> You are correct. The Fed has never tied tapering to an interest rate hike, but it is sometimes mentioned in the same paragraph when they discuss raising rates.
Excellent. Thanks, mod.
The Fed base rate isn't the only thing that affects interest rates. In fact, rates have already gone up a bit since last month when Jerome said we probably taper in November.
Z got Hwanged!!
Gah damn Snapchat hoes are annoying

I'm a big believer in buying calls on ATVI after the opening dip. 

&#x200B;

They made over a billion in just microtransactions in Q3. They're going through a leadership shift and a PR nightmare right now but that isn't going to stop WOW and CoD Warzone players. Gamers don't give a fuck about PR issues.
Totally agree. Free money to be had here
Today's my birthday, what should I gift myself?
A day off and a nice lunch.
I bought myself ariat boots 2 years ago, going to buy myself a glock this year. Just pick something you’ve been wanting for a while (within reason) and just buy it if you have the cash. Treat yourself
DN
Happy birthday! 🎈
Sell naked amc calls. Might as well fuck yourself since no one will

I had the order loaded up yesterday and didn’t click send 😑
Half their business is toast...  30
AHHHH probably should but can’t make myself pull the trigger this market is irrational
fuck, just 5 more mins to decide. there's a chance it falls to 40 today
Theres always a bull trap/dead cat bounce
Imagine thinking markets weren’t designed to go up
The only thing that matters is how much the FED balance sheet grows every month.

Don’t buy within the first 30 min
I will always use this tip. Thank you.
This is dumb advice, the first 30 is some of the best time to make money. It often has some of the biggest swings of the day. Yeah, you have to be more careful in the first 30 minutes but not playing it at all is a no balls move

Tips for dealing with a coworker that is a Jehovah’s Witness?
> The Jehovah’s Witness religion is a Christian denomination that has been around since the 19th century. The name of this religious group comes from its belief in Jesus Christ and his role as “the one true witness,” or prophet. Members of the faith believe that God sent Jesus to Earth to save humans from sin and death by sacrificing himself on their behalf at Calvary (or Golgotha).
Tell him to witness your gains
You gotta tell them to respect your own religion even if that is being agnostic. Escalate to your boss if they keep doing it but put your foot down first. My fam is JW and I tend to stay away from them.

My fucking CRWD puts ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968) I might need to give up on dream and become a boomer. Trading has not been working out for me lately.
This volatility will be going into overdrive at 2pm
So if fed announces tapering or rate hike or both, what’s the conventional wise investing from there on?
Some volatility probably. Flip a coin for which direction  we go.
0% chance of a rate hike lol.
Iffffffffff, what if . It’s a hypothetical question
If the fed hiked rates right now the market would absolutely shit the bed for at least a month, if not longer.
So what would you do in that situation? only asking cause I blew my account up yesterday lol trynna be a lame boomer and recoup my shit
The vastly more likely scenario is the fed announces the taper schedule and maybe 1-2 more board members see a rate hike or two in 2022 (it was an even split between 2022 and 2023 last meeting).

Your risk is that language around inflation changes to being slightly more hawkish or the schedule for tapering is more aggressive than expected.

I don’t see a ton of opportunity there tbh. If you want to get wild maybe grab some puts right before then sell if there’s a quick algo drop and buy calls at EOD.

That’s definitely possible , it’s floating rn
If what Zillow doing with houses was dumb and a loss making business then what Carvana is doing with cars is exactly the same thing. 

They pay cash for your car without any inspection or due diligence and surely overpaying for every car they buy now.

Wonder if PYPL drops under $200 sometime this month.

They're taking it on the chin for even considering that PINS deal.

WTF ddin't they buy AFRM when they had the chance?
consideration of the PINS deal is a sign they're slowing and looking for avenues for future growth that they have yet to figure out

Sell some, secure that profit.  Let some ride.
Goddamn those ocgn bags are fucking heavy now...
At original DD the stock was below 9$
So if I made 3 day trades can I make a fourth? Yes, I’m poor
Yes, but you’ll be placed into trading jail for 90 days.
It sucks in there man 😓
Yes but the 4th locks you out for 90 days.

Better make it count. 🚫🐀
Looks like I’m diamond handing Tesla calls expiring Friday, I’m all in too
3 in a 5-day period are allowed.  A 4th will trigger a margin call.  Your broker will be keeping a counter for you.  If you buy one, buy another one, and then sell 2 at once, that is 2 day trades.
If you make a 4th trade your account won't get restricted until tomorrow. 

Just go crazy with all the trades you want.
If it’s the first time using the 4th day trade you should be able to get it removed.  However, use the “get out of jail free” card wisely because you only get to use it once.  Contact your broker first to confirm.
DraftKings, why are you being a bitch!?! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Funny how a ‘flat day’ for tsla is still crazy volatile.
It’s only volatile if you look at the numbers, not really volatile when you look at %

Are you sure the N doesn't stand for the N word? Looks like it
Any chance that Powell says something that makes market tank?  Thinking about longing an E mini but seems dangerous
I’m wondering the same. Investors sure don’t think he’s going to have any surprises.
The last thing the dude wants is to surprise the markets.

He has been saying for weeks that he is planning on tapering QE starting in November.

If that news comes out and we see a rate hike move within Q2/3 2022 (which bonds have already priced in) - We could see a nice rally especially if the US10Y stays below the 1.65 mark after the news comes out.
He knows he’s out. Might burn it all down. Who knows?
You know as much as jpow “should” say something to crash the market…he won’t. His buddies and his portfolio will drive higher and higher until February. He ll leave. The can will be kicked. The next person will be “responsible” for crashing a market that should have crashed in March of 2020. So your actual best bet is to pretend that nothing is wrong and nothing will go wrong and the market will reach all time all time high highs or atathhs for short

Consultant on System Center products.
Knock out some Azure certs before applying
How good were u on azure tho and did u need to know coding? What do u do now. Not sure if I like consulting
It was 2015, so Azure was just starting to gain steam.  MSFT is into just about everything, so pick a discipline.  Azure anything is huge.  Azure Powershell is huge.  SQL anything is huge.
Is azure powershell even a job? What kinda positions can you get as an entry level?
No, but it’s desirable cert/skill.

If you're holding a bunch of important shares or indexes and the market moons after the speeches, you'll go up. But if something bad happens you'll lose.

If you're not holding anything important right now, if it moons, nothing happens to you, but if it dips, you can buy and then wait for it to readjust (quickly)

So not owning right now is the only way to not lose and also definitely win.
what if it dips and then you yolo and then it dips even more.
That is what Socrates called "sucking nutsacks for the cream"
Good point. Everyone quickly sell all your holdings before the announcement.  All as one at the Ask
Want F to finally just bust that 18.30

When these bubbles start to pop indexes won’t be spared.  AMC is the largest holding in IWM with over twice the size of the second largest holding.  No way I’m touching that.

i got sold my previous puts for 500 a piece and bought 65 puts tryna get a months salary with this shit stock
I’m selling half and holding half, either way profits secured.

Now apparently inflation is good, we want everyone to expect 2% so to do that we're going to keep it above 2% for a long time.  What happened to temporary inflation?

They're fucking clowns that want to rape everyone but the rich, they're not even trying to hide it.

Tapering was priced in all along plot twist
Fed announced start of tapering at $15B per month (vs $120B month today, will be zero by June).  Inflation risks continue to be viewed as transitory. No mention of potential change in S/T rates (0-25 bp). Powell expected to stay dovish in comments at 230ET.  10yrTY 1.591% +4bp.
Well, I guess it’s time to dump my life savings into SPY
But if you invest $20 into SPY how will you afford dinner tonight?

EDIT: up 30% already
Jpow said bear r fucccc. Spread em
We have absolutely no clue when inflation will slow down but trust us it's definitely ending Q2
jpow is quite masterful at answering the question but not really answering the question. I'd just be like, "fuck around and find out"
Uh oh... Hard question for Powell
why is kevin o'leary a reporter now?
Oh shut the fuck up CNBC, have someone who can talk properly ask a question.
"Please be less tarded mr. journalist"

This is fun

Lol, no sir, the very strong demand is because everyones rich suddenly
Bye-bye, bears. See ya in the funny papers.

Powell's answer again is brrrr fuck your puts. What tradeoff? SPY 470 EOD
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr best day so far
NVDA lets fucking gooooo
Is this happening because the market only cares about rate hikes and that's not scheduled till next year. Market up no matter what until then?
It’s simple, I see Jpow speaking I buy calls and prints. Cheat code

When rates rise in June
aka next year. why just kick the can when you can gorilla hulk smash punt that bitch down 3-4 fiscal quarters...
Rates won't go up much (if at all) nor will they do anything.
And let inflation just run away. Riiiighttt
They're already doing it.  Also they don't really have a choice. The alternative is to collapse their house of cards. Better to pretend they are handling it

Take a shot every time jpow says transitory
Or licks his lips.....you can't unsee this.
Bro this is insane feels good to be a bull right now fuck that dip man
We don’t need QE and we don’t need low interest rates.  We just need daddy JPow up at the podium from 9:30-4:00 every trading day, and the market will 🚀🚀🚀🚀.
I quit my job to keep the printer on youre welcome bulls!
THEY HIKED RATES! ...In Poland.
why didn’t i Just buy SPY calls
There will never be another red day. Prices will keep going up but our wages won't. Put everything you own into SPY or be poor from inflation.
If you look at the spy monthly chart. It's almost as if September didn't even happen. The recovery has been so good, that it has returned to the previous slope.
Sept/Oct pullbacks allow us to get good positions while we wait for Santa.  Santa is spelled "Jpow" now.
No it hasn't and you can't even see the previous slope on the monthly chart

Phew, for a moment there I almost ruined my financial well being

I had no business making money today but Papa Powell giveth
The pump is alive and well. Fuck your puts
Does Bloomberg have fucking elf working for them?
he has weird lips
question: how do you define maximum employment 

jpow: we can’t calculate it. We don’t know that number and it’s changing so it really depends on how many weekly calls I bought
Taper has been priced in for weeks, yet WSB response is the glib remark 'It'S PrIcEd In!!'  and then goes and buys SPY puts.  lol,  so obvious you needed to invert WSB.
Legit question - can someone please explain to me why the markets are reacting positively to Powell's statements on the taper? Is it the news on interest rates not moving? It's a nice surprise to see the market still running, but I'd like to understand why.
He said business as usual. The "taper" actually means 105 billion of stimulus this month. And no intrest rate changes.
Dont ask questions enjoy the free money
Because the market is detached from reality
Damn whatever I buy turns red immediately
Inverse yourself

Is it insider trading if the inside information is just in his head?
I think I should take PYPL behind the barn and shoot it. This thing is a dog
Lol my pypl $280 call for next year is -48%. I’ll be buying a lower strike. Hopefully it will reverse and go back up.
These ATVI calls gonna print I guarantee it

Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist but I do find it weird that hedge funds short ladder attack my entire portfolio.
Well, boys, I’ve loaded the boat with a literal shitload of calls in spy and sq at varying strikes and expiry dates. Time for rope or lambo.
Y'all already know JPow has loaded his Aston Martin to the brim with SPY calls. He'll slowly lower his mouth to the mic and sensually whisper "money", instantly doubling their value.
Gonna take a quick nap. When I come back, SPY better be -7%
-70*
Ready for the greatest nothing burger of all time
I guess no more tapering and back to forever 0 interest rates and endless money printing?

I've been there for a couple of weeks.  The fomo is stressful.
What happened to ATVI? Did they announced that Bill Cosby will be in charge of HR or what?
Announced delays on some big game releases I think.
Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 delayed, co-leader leaves, q4 falls short of expectations
Game delays and analyst downgrades, weak q4 forecast
Blizzard is shitting the bed. WoW Sucks + game delays. Other IP delays. BlizzCon canceled. Don't respect players.
Game delays and 18/33 of the analysts covering them slashed their price targets, some as low at $65.
Glad GME gave people the opportunity to hold 250$ bags again
$287.80 here
It's how you get diamond hand apes. Harder to sell when in the red lol
So houses aren’t in a bubble? Zillow was just a pile of shit?

The market has reached a point where it won't be stopped by anything less than a catastrophe of some kind
Wrong, a catastrophe will only solidify its rocketness and bring it more vertical.  Stop using logic, it doesnt exist any more.
Will take thermonuclear war
Catastrophe = more printing = bullish.
And we seen what happens then. A year later it's like it never fucking happened.
This is unhealthy but who gives a fuck. No one does the right things anyways

What news was that?
> The PSFE will be on AWS.
I am all in for TSMC, i think they are the number one in chip industry and that share price should easily come to around 200$ soon
Its not at 200 because people think China will invade
But they are constructing right now a huge manufacturing place (100 billion $) in the USA as well
I’m hoping it sinks to 108 then I’m in
Lol cvs beat estimates by a fair margin and raises guidance so of course it's just gunna go sideways. Fml.
Was tempted to buy some lotto calls yesterday but it seemed too boomerish to move quickly. Will continue yolo’ing in to much more useless companies
Yea I figure maybe the beat justifies the run-up its had this month and not much more. Idk, the 10k filing looked pretty good so maybe it'll move on the call unless the slides are already released then rip my options.
Huge float. Hard to move.
And here we are, moving pretty good actually.

Should have kept my 91 puts on zillow

Day 2 of wanting AMC to dilute shares.
why are calls on BBBY so cheap but puts are way too expensive?
They option chain hasn’t updated since it mooned after market close. So all the calls are cheap because they were way OTM and the puts were all ITM
I have no idea, it seemed like the calls were ITM so I ordered some, let's see if they fill or if the machines get to them first.

What u playing
Tell me why I shouldn’t buy Disney calls
Because they are completely upside down on Disney +, inflation is spinning wildly out of control and nobody will be able to afford to go to a Disney park...
It's the only red ticker in a sea of green
So it's on sale?
Well yes I bought calls this morning but I took a small position
Been watching too. Not sure
Cause it just broke the bottom of the channel.
Nov 12 the Disney+ day. Last year that shit had calls up 900-1200%
When do UPST calls make sense? Like 350c or 360c. It swings wildly these days and earnings are next week
They don't make sense. Puts do though.
Z.. no.. lol

CCJ quietly handing out 10 baggers this morning.
Why didn't it do that when I had calls on it 2 months ago
Think it keeps going? Looking at $30C
Personally I wouldn’t play it weekly but if you can afford to buy more time or even LEAPS I think uranium is a solid play.
11/12 $30C is what I’m eyeing. I know nothing about the stock but you turned my attention to it
Current price is an ATH so you’re banking on another 10+% from there. I’m a gambler but I wouldn’t make that bet.
It's a solid company . Planeed to buy but didn't execute my plan
Why do I feel like I should always inverse myself. And why do I always lose. No matter what. Even if I inverse myself.
Dont even need a 10x er or whatever. Im just happy stocks are paying my rent again this month 🥳
Not financial advice, but buy VSTO before earnings.  This baby’s about to pop to 50 very soon.

On the other hand, r/ABNB shows that the app is being used by homeless people to squat in random homes for months, which the cops apparently can do nothing about. Lmao what a shit business.

Better see AVTI moonshot..
Do you think my exes  just walk around saying God I'd like one more slice of that chubby Charlie
on some real sh*t though.. what do y’all do when you aren’t feeling yourself and don’t even wanna trade
Usually tell myself to stop being a bitch, sadly not many other options as a man
from one man to another. i needed that 🙏🏽 glookin out
Wait. Emotions pass and you'll feel better again. Don't trade when you aren't in a good mental state.
Research PC parts and look for second hand component deals to flip or use in a build to resell, do a lot of gardening and walking through state parks, do some writing, read books about bee keeping so when I own some land I can build up and maintain a healthy colony. Anything that sets me up for a project I actually immediately care about tends to make it easier for me to avoid ruminating.
turn the phone off for a bit and do something else, go for a walk, cook something comforting, meet up with friends if possible, listen to music, play music, there are lots of options it's just hard to get the energy to do one when you're feeling down.
lmk if you find out

AMD about to bust through 130

edit: I'm up 150% on 130C expiring Friday Most people would sell because of the fed announcement but I know JPOW doesn't give a fuck about rate hikes or any of that 🏳️‍🌈🐻 shit
In the words of the best trader of our time, mr shia labeouf “just do it”
In all seriousness shit posting aside these Z and ATVI dips are free money.
No, Z got exposed
Nah they still have value and will focus on their core business now which actually makes money
Idk if Z is quite there yet, I’m hoping for mid 50s

But yeah, rebound is all but certain, don’t think it will be in the next quarter tho
That’s a steep drop bro. You may never get that chance. I say 65 and below it’s a buy. Well I don’t buy anything, I just fade the dip by selling puts.
Idk if Z is quite there yet, I’m hoping for mid 50s

But yeah, rebound is all but certain, don’t think it will be in the next quarter tho
SPY with its usual pump, dump, pump, dump, and pump again.
Amd 140 next week :)
This only hapens if po0pPowell gives us good news today
The market not dumping before JPow speaking to trap 🌈🐻 then moon afterwards has me nervous.  Do we have the Gains Goblin Jerome today that's going to say something to flash crash us?
We’ve flash crashed for a day every fed meeting this year
No we dumped all day before Jerome speaks then we pumped back afterwards.  I'm talking a flash crash like he caused in  October 2018 where we drilled to the center of the earth.
Yeah I'm standing ready to buy the dip this time.
CAR deserves to be at sub 200
Got my play account back up to the level I can day trade again. Time to celebrate by making stupid decisions!

Look whos right
Was on leave with pain pills after surgery this week.  Now i understand all the addiction talk.  It feels like youre in heaven when you take them.
Yeah bro be careful was addicted for 3 years and getting them from the doctor is how a lot of people start. Trust me don’t take that path it fucking sucks
Ye i wouldnt know how to keep getting them but i hear you.  Dumped them out on my desk and counted how many i had left last night.  Never done that before with any other pill.  They just feel so good damn.
Yeah I think doctors are fucked for starting people even on 5 mg percs with the Tylenol in them even those can start your addiction pretty quick I think they should always start with naproxen and then go to tramadol if they have too because they get so many people addicted when they give you the week supply for your pain after they are gone you just want more. Fucked my life completely withdraws feel like your dying and you’ll just be broke every single week. Give yourself like 2-3 days after youll take your last one and you’ll feel normal it only take about a week sometimes a couple days for people to get the mental addiction. That can even be as subtle as having thoughts like “damn wish I had more of those” stay safe brother. After they are gone it’s fuck those pills
Yeah thanks for the heads up.  Definitely feel how easy it is to get hooked but ill steer clear when these are out.
Yessir hope you get back to feeling 100% 🦾
Appreciate
I bought CAR puts at 480, it has dropped almost 50% to below 300 and somehow my puts havent moved at all. Can someone explain this

Fuck, all I got left is 1 ply toilet paper.

Calls on Costco.
If I had sold my Tesla call this morning, I would have had the $ to buy 2 on this dip. Darn
Right fuckin bullshit I'm sick of life
Theory: Tesla will dance around 1200 -1100 until December which you will see 1500+
Interesting that Zillow spiked so much before the gouging.

Seems nefarious.
Happens all the time. Top blows off and then tanks.
****looks at market nervously****
That's why I'm holding some puts.
Taking profits from the puts on bbby I don't trust this shit it's getting too slow lol
They are no tapering the dems migth as well say we will lose next election sorry
When is CAR going back to 560
Never lol

I know stonks are disconnected from all fundamentals but this “easing” will be interesting to see how and if it will even effect this market.
hope earnings can give DKNG a kick in the ass. was cruising nicely until that attempted acquisition fucked everything up
Gambling definitely isn't going out of style
for sure. I think the big question is how much they’re spending trying to buy market share and if it’s paying off

my calls would enjoy that.
Spy 2dte's at 2:30pm got it 📝
Like I don't know if it's some algorithm, a professional trader doing weird spreads, or some stupid retail investor but the market has apparently decided that the fact that AMC just went down from $42 to $40 in half an hour means that there is now a *lower* chance that AMC would get down to $33 per share by November 19th. 🤷‍♂️

Like I sold the put instead of buying it so I'm not complaining, but it still feels a bit hilarious to see a put go down from IV crush as the underlying falls.
IV crush is more powerful than Delta, in fact, IV crush might be the most powerful force in the known universe
It’s the pricing mechanism. MM price gouge option buyers at times of peak interest. Then IV drops to normal
BBBY up 4% from bottom😎Only down 70% on calls from open🤡
Everyone talking about tapering what's happening with infrastructure bills
It was gutted
Lol tsla. Just what?
ATVI is my white whale
More like black swan
someone here was saying that the options chain pricing looks like the market isn't expecting a large move for a long time. I call bullshit and bought a bunch of Jan 22 72.5C
Yeah I doubled down today
Need TSLA to hit ATH again so I can open another spread
Which one of you cheese dicks told me it would be January all over again?
MSFT bby 335 was looking like your number today
The fuck is happening with tsla right now? Lol this stock never ceases to entertain.
Got a SQ 250 Nov 19 LFG 🚀
Yeah, my calls regained half their losses from yesterday already. Bring on the earnings gamble!
Got a put Debit for some down side protection I think we’ll be alright we’ll see
Yeah, planning to buy a put or two as well just in case.
Holy fk, bought 100 🥭 on the dip today, sold a CC on the rip and overall up, those options are so volatile lol thanks for buying my call which is up 50% now
thanks for the word salad
Damn, that daily candle on GME is cold blooded.

Welcome to Schrodinger's Casino. Everything is both priced in and not. Never know until you gamble.
I know I keep saying it. Z PUTS. Get in on it. This company is fuk. Up 145% and its not even in to 50s yet.
I just feel like CLOV is going to break soon.
NOT A BAGHOLDER
Almost bought my first TSLA call at the very bottom today. Lmao I’m a bitch tho
Can RKT hit 19 by end of next week??
Everything is still, and quiet. I'm scared
Both CRSR and TLRY are up, and WISH was up at one point, and everyone is still asking what's wrong today lmao. Everything is fuk
My options lookin' dirtier than Kyler Quinn's pussy
I did not think I’d end up in the red until tomorrow. Guh
Thoughts on buying a LEAPS on ATVI right now?
I did it
Today's an overreaction. CoD release later this week. People freaking out about D2 and OW2 delays but those aren't even the biggest money makers. Revenue still on the rise; long term outlook solid
Threw a bit for 7 Jan $70 calls. We’ll see what happens
Wouldn't touch it at all. Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 delayed. They're not even doing work at that shit company.
Time to get fucked by RKT again!
RKT move your ass to $20
It’s so annoying when RH has bad option prices in for contracts that aren’t as liquid. I just want to admire my tendies and RH is showing a loss

I'm so interested to see how the FED plays this. They went into yesterday's meeting with three weeks of unbridled, ripping, RSI pegging, 7% index growth totally unchecked.
  
They've got to make some moves soon.
Alright, what’s the play. I’m bored
The market will crash when JPow speaks--- si o no?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
My balls are feeling big holding through the meeting, but my brain is panicking
The only reason the fed even gives pressers is to calm you retards down, we all know what they are doing and everything is priced in.
It’s always old farts that sell gold coins on infomercials
Anyone playing ATVI?
For the next few weeks I'm going to be suffering: A few days ago I was going to buy 10k put contracts at near 0 cents for Zillow.  They are now trading at like $3.50.

I don't think they'll help them yet, they're not dying or preparing bankruptcy. Someone smart might buy up the homes and keep the housing bubble party going.
Fuck it closed my SDC FD's. Watch it go up now.
Jacked to the tits in shares. Thank you for your service.
BBBY call credit spreads were actually free money after all. nice.
DKNG has become a boomer stock in terms of movement. Boring as fuck.
Friday all in.
Something something tools. Something something taper. Something something dovish. Something something transitory. Something something money.
PYPL is so close to this triple bottom
Weird volume for the SPY is only 14m usually at this time of the day it be around 23-25m
Yeah, everyone has been saying this. It's fed day, this will make or break spy, everyone is waiting
What the big deal? Fed going to either taper now or December and raise rate when taper is finish.
They've been easing the economic burden since the beginning of COVID, our whole economy is in a bubble and it's going to pop eventually, the entire tech sector Is overbought and buyer sentiment is out of wack with buying and holding strategies on indexes for retirement plans has set this tapering up to crash the market, pair that with inflation 3x the target and we'll see one of the biggest capital retraction from the market into high interest rate bonds once tapering starts, this is all my own thoughts and DD but If tapering is even kind of not priced in I see a big drop in SPY, so everyone is waiting to see if they can pull there positions slowly over the next month or rug pull today. Again, all my own research
Bleh any rug pull is already been cushion by the massive run up we have last month.
Realistically if a rug pull happens it could take us back to sub 400, maybe even mid 300's, tapering will mark the end of the most liberal use of quantitative easing the US has ever seen and ironically could recreat the 1920's financial crisis in the 2020's
I guess we have to wait and see how the market react
Haha I got screwed on my puts but my calls are starting to print, gotta love this delusion
I think we gonna bounce  from 2 to 2.30 and then jpow tanks it
I can feel a bird second pop here
We hungry jerome

What’s that telling you boys?!
I DONT KNOW

TELL ME
530C will fucking PRINT
I dont know, what IS IT telling us?
That you don't understand the black Scholes formula
Deep OTM IV should not be the same as way closer to the money

Fuck this market. Doesn’t make sense at all.
Everyone expecting the market to drop and it goes up.. classic bamboozle
> Exactly.
Only the bears somehow didn't believe the FOMC decision wasn't priced in.
Nobody with any brain cells expected the market to drop
Jpow is only going to echo the sentiment. We all know what's coming this month and the market has priced it in already

I don’t like taxes as much as the next guy, but doesn’t it make sense to increase taxes when stocks are only up due to government spending? Without that it would’ve been a fuck show, and we’d all be crying about it just as much as we are about any tax increase
the only purpose of taxes is to give value to the USD and to control inflation

government spending and taxes should not be connected
Big govt will always find an excuse to try to raise taxes, even if it doesn’t make sense.

Lol, now J Powell's re-defining "transitory", that's a new one

Bought 30 465 calls this morning for 200 bucks. Just sold all of them for 1000. Thanks JPOW.
Bears thumbing down J Powells youtube presentation. lol
spy just going up a dollar on every 5 min candle. No biggie
JPow said, “PAAAAHHHMMMP EET”
Sold my 0dte for a measly 40%, if I held for 10 more min I’d be up over 150% 😌
paper handed.  calls only go up
My only regret is not buying more SPY calls

Okay JPow if you could somehow mention Disney, or a mouse, or why to have faith in certain theme parks... you could really make me nut.
Where’s that dude that did the math about spy $500 going to come exponentially faster than $300 and $400? Dude said he had leaps that have probably printed so hard.

Exited SPY puts for a 50% loss. Nice. LOL

Decent hedge against the rest of my port I guess.

You should not sleep on this bull run here

Felt bad about dumping my Tesla calls at noon but just looked and realized even at 1200, those calls in total were only worth $65 more.  Theta is a beast
I bought a strangle on Tesla earlier and sold the call when it was up, but now the stock keeps going up and my put keeps going up too--is this just due to IV?
Yup
Got an SPY 11/5 460p before close yesterday and sold it shortly after opening for a 20% gain. Just checked and that bad boy would’ve been down 70% if I’d held through today lol.
Should’ve bought more spy instead of gme 🤦‍♂️
There are few people to trust here but i feel the majority of us can agree you don't ever trust anyone with ape flair
Loaded up on a ton of SPY calls, everyone can expect a circuit breaker tomorrow 📉📉📉
Dang super extra power hour
They massacred VXX
Wtf happened with spy. I go an actually do some work and I come back to my spy and Tesla calls mooning

Scratch that 1,230 at open tomorrow hopefully lmao

If I lose my shares this Friday or
Not 😬😬😬😬
Roku is losing YouTube and potentially Amazon. What makes you want to hold calls?
The only thing that makes sense is the big players have found a way to use supply to constrain shorts to constantly make this go up... my question is when the F do they drop the hammer... Appears they can't?
They can't.

Let's go BB. Rockets away.
Bought $13 call, just need it to zoom a little more
My Jan 20C are getting less red:)
GME is a fucking nail biter. Breaks VWAP, goes back above and is now holding it. If we can stay above $236 we'll probably test $247 again.
🌛🔜
WHO approval opens up OCGN to huge markets. Poorer countries that can’t do the frozen phizer or Moderna vaccine. It has a 12 month shelf life. Going to be huge in countries like India. You know how many people are in India? 4x our population. And this opens it up to many other countries as well. We’ve yet to see how many. 

This is a huge deal. 

OCGN has a triple top at 15.75. So it’s really struggling to break that top. But it will soon. I see $20 EOW even if this gets reported with accuracy on msm.
YUUUP!

Yeah they usually are, but they aren't right now. That's sort of my point
Oof this didn’t age well already
Lol, it'll age fine. I didn't say SPY would go straight down the second I made the comment. You can't predict minute-by-minute movements.

I might have to actually pay taxes on my gains this year. What a thought
Roll those losses forward!
Same. I was in the hole for most of the year and now suddenly turning a profit. Not sure how I feel about it.
Haven’t seen green since may, went from -35% to 0% today, might need to turn things around before tax season
Yeah, I was down 60% at one point during that last dip we had, now up like 10% on the year. Better find something to yolo to get back to 0% before tax season.
Some nice gains, I am Working on moving 100% of my portfolio to December SPY 500 calls
Honestly thinking about doing the same so I don’t have to keep track of my shit day to day.
Short term spy calls are what made my account recover, turning to long calls to make my account prosper, almost 0 risk involved
You need to make a deposit now if you don't want to pay failure to deposit penalty and interest. 20% of your profit should be good enough if long term, about 30% short term.
uhh what? what’s this 20 profit you speak of
It’s only if the year before you had a windfall, the next year you have to pay quarterly taxes.  You’ll want to lookup the rules for the specifics .
So if i’m still negative end of year, I won’t have to worry about this right?
> That is correct.
Depends on whether the gain/loss is realized or unrealized meaning whether you sold or not.
It is a theoretical concept for wsb members. In practice,, if you have gains, you ll have to pay tax. If you held for longer than a year, you pay long term capital gains tax assuming you are from the USA
This seems like a difficult concept to grasp, I’m new to this gains thing, I’ll look more into this thanks
Are you talking about quarterly payments?
Yes
https://www.irs.gov/payments
Ah, thanks. I was confused for a second since the end of this quarter is already end of year.
Anyone gme calls?
I have one because of the digital marketplace speculation. I want a good alternative to Steam.

Gary black raised a great point on Hertz ‘yet’ deal sign.

https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1455876201118064640?s=21

They are likely waiting for EV credit to go through before signing. This way they don’t risk not getting the credit in case last minute language changes ie ordered on or after Jan 1 vs delivered on or after Jan 1.

As a sign of good faith and show commitments they did the advertising campaign and press release which Elon supported and perhaps even deliberately doing the tweet a week later to keep hertz and Tesla in headlines.

Shameless copy from another commenter spreading awareness
Isnt the bill now supposedly in jeopardy since dems lost ground last night? Or is that just polititards wanting to feel important?
Hertz said that the deliveries have started.

Just buy GME. Everything else is garbage 

That's what this retarded market has become
Oh lawwwd GME $300 this week and I’ll cum
It’ll tickle $350 again and probably get smacked down…again. The sold a shitload of shorts around $350 before the buy button was turned off.
This week? Today!
In all seriousness, what is going on with $GME?  I bought in way too late this morning and am still up 6% in like 10 minutes!
ppl got bored of pumping tesla and the hype died so now they're pumping gme.
GME is going to the moon again nice
That was the fastest 5k I’ve ever made off an option play. Thank you GME.
Point to the part where GME touched you for the apes that bought 250-300c

Anyone else in puts right now? Or is it too obvious. Is all this shit priced in. I’m losing my mind.
puts are the rational "call" but this market is not rational atm.
Ha right remember last year when they literally closed global commerce as we know it and the market had a face ripping rally lmao.

Guys where the fuck have you been, that is the main goal of neolib/neocon politics all over the globe the past 50 years. They absolutely want the middle class to die that’s the whole point!
Remember when $GME was at $250 this morning? 🪦
Yeah that's when I finally sold all my GME, good day
GME and AMC always creating new generations of bagholders. Love it.

I think we need to begin considering the possibility that JPow is a fucking dumbass. A loaf of bread is gonna cost $20 next year at this rate, and the economy doesn't even need help anymore.

Going balls deep in mortgage bonds when housing demand is insane and prices skyrocketing.

🌈🌈
Are you Elizabeth Warren?
I don't think he's a dumbass, just corrupt. Consider if you will who gave him that job.  


Nothing about today has made me the slightest bit less bearish
You’re not wrong, yet you believe that this is a bearish sentiment. Everyone with a brain knows our institutions are compromised, but if they are corrupt, then why would there be an adverse reaction for the multinationals who rigged them to begin with? They’re just going to keep accelerating the income inequality and buying up all the assets on planet earth. That’s the point. Why would the market crash?
Lets be honest, its really a ploy to reduce labor costs in a way that most people don't understand.

# OH LOOK, MINIMUM WAGE IS NOW $15!!!!

🌈🐻 are over killed, thanks Jpow
I am upvoting everything. 

Take that!
Imagine wasting time looking into how messed up the American financial system is and wasting money on puts expecting everything to collapse when you can just buy calls and shit post instead
For real though... you'd think I would of learned my lesson by now...
Healthcare is on the verge of collapse and infrastructure is crumbling, but we literally gave away trillions to businesses and people that weren't even struggling just because someone got the sniffles.  No way we won't be suffering for generations.

Edit: autocorrect changed someone to Donnie, that's creepy
You bought puts didn't you lmaooooooooooo
No I got bailed out of some truly bad calls today.  There's never a time to buy puts lol.
Lol you're smart then, everything you said is true but it's not getting fixed as long as we have boomers in office. Best thing to do is cash in while you can

Flair his parents
I'm not a guy and taking out a loan to load up on Lucid stocks after it's run is stupid.
Most people who build wealth do so by beginning with debt. Taking out a loan and dumping it all into stock with interest rates as low as they are and stock valuations and inflation all ballooning, it’s a lot less stupid than it seems.
For sure there are good debts and bad debts and as much as I enjoy the bull run, it's not full proof. Every stock experience a pullback after a crazy run. It'll be unwise to fomo into a stock when it balloons with a loan before it even finds its floor.
The way I see it, there’s really no way to know what a floor would be with valuations this far away from any sort of fundamentals, and the longer you wait to jump onto the gravy train hoping for a golden opportunity where it makes sense to invest, the more likely you’re gonna miss it. People said for months that tesla 700 was ridiculous, that it had to correct, and its obviously not worth what it’s valued at, but still it has risen like crazy. If they believe in the company and are both in their prime earning years of like 40-50, then it’s a reasonable gamble. If they are yoloing it into options and just trying to make a quick buck, maybe less reasonable, although this market is stupid enough that it might be brilliant.
Tesla is unique in that its way ahead of other EVs in terms of battery, software and the experience it gives to their drivers. The self driving feature alone sets it apart to all the competition in the market and my parents aren't in their "prime earning years." My dad is sick and my mom sees this as a retirement ticket that'll materialize within the next year. Their expectations are unrealistic and with a strong pullback they could actually lose way more than they borrowed. I'm not that bullish on Lucid personally..
Well then yeah they might be stupid or desperate. I’m not in lucid or tesla. Sorry about your dad being sick, that’s unforunate.
It's just a bad situation and I appreciate you caring. :) I'm sure it'll mean a world to my dad strangers care about his health. I'm holding both but it's not life changing money. Thanks for your outlook and advice.
Dam, well now I feel bad bullying a girl…..
I can't tell if this is sarcasm or not..
It’s not,,,,, chivary isn’t dead yet
Then can you delete your comment?
Hmmmmmm, that’s a tough one…… a tough one indeed….. On one hand I could, and make a girl happy…. On the other hand I could keep farming these extremely tasty upvotes…… 🤔🤔🤔🤔
...
Fine, if you really want it deleted I will……
I would appreciate that a lot.
Your welcome

sometimes I wonder if there's more to life than sucking dick to buy FDs
Yeah, there's also taking gains to get your dick sucked
Yeah, to fund someone else’s fd’s until you’re out of money. It’s how the ecosystem works.
You're the real MVP. Dumpster gang loves you
Here's an idea....Why don't you give me half the money you were gonna bet, then we'll go out back, I'll kick you in the nuts, and we'll call it a day.

meme rally over
Ohh OCGN takin a shit..thought it was going to open at $40 today?
Thank you for this. Been waiting to buy puts.
A lot of OCGN people learned "sell the news" the hard  way
Doubled up on my adderall to study for an exam and have so far watched tickers on the shitter for 1.5 hours... jesus fuck i need to do something

Hell Yeah!!

GME AMC profits going into tech
I was promised a meme rally what is this
You were lied to by shrills sir
What he said. Meme = pump and dump. Maybe you got dumped on 💩💩💩💩
Didn't,  I've been provoking the apes for the past week
some bullshit as usual
Managed to catch the exact top of GME 40 mins ago and my calls are down 67%.  Someone mod me
Learn the lesson and move on
I bought calls and opened spreads the whole way up. 230, 235, 240, 245. I was up about $800 with a few k in upside depending on share price Friday. Then I got greedy and bought a 250 call at $15.13.
I bought the same call for $9
Show us
is coffee a literal insta-shit for anyone else... like its instant ass water for me
Gotta eat a better breakfast. Otherwise it just goes right through me.
i don’t eat breakfast. maybe it’s that
Ya probably. Gotta get some food in there to absorb.
Not always but if my stomach is feeling upset *at all* coffee is an instant coup de grace
The opposite for me. I drink two cups black in the morning.
cigs for me. coffee too but not as instantaneous
back in my cig days, coffee and cig in the morning, yeah you’re emptying out
Nicotine and caffeine are diuretics
Plenty of people tried to warn you that OCGN approval was a sell the news event.
And yet here I am holding like a garden flag in a hurricane
I bought 1 share so I can say I helped. Sad I did. Ha
Big rip to all the ocgn bulls
Makes no sense, higher volume buys then sells yet the price keeps dropping.
Fuck it, out of OCGN before I go red. Hopium cost me a lot of money this morning lol.

I've never seen SPY jump like this.
Wait down she goes...
people that traded on Black Monday: ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Hahahah I'm so fucked, I guess that's what I get for being a bear. Back to my cave see you next year.
That final bull trap
I buy puts, and SPY skyrockets and i lose 20%.  I buy calls and SPY plummets and i lose 20% instantly. Bout ready to just say fuck this game and delete it off my phone.
But that one time that your SPY options hits 500% in a day. Keep chasing the dragon.
+500% 1 week. 

-98% all time
Just get better at the game. If you were going to play spy should've been before the announcement.
And i'm out. Sold the Z PUTS. 20k easy
you think it's gonna spike on the JPOW talk, or just taking gains you're happy with & playing it safe?
Wtf happened with SPY on that rocket up?
Bears are BBQ
False, Bears make terrible bbq.

Are we finally done flirting with $1200? Wtf

That is a good observation. Drop it like it’s hot 🔥

Tsla easy 1200 today
GME 50% day incoming
GME to the MOOOOOOOOON
AMC to $60 EOW, GME to $350 EOW. We all meet at Wendy’s and eat our tendies 🤤
OCGN now at same price it was yesterday. This isn’t ‘sell the news’. It’s gearing up for a big run. Consolidating and shorts pushing. I don’t think people realize how many aren’t vaccinated in poor countries that would use this vaccine. And the demand for it.
WHO approval is the pre-catalyst.  It gives confidence in the vaccine, and paves the way, but it will take Canada/USA approval for use and/or manufacturing deals to really push the stonk.
I think things will improve once Ocugen lays out the full plan to co-develop with Bahrat now that it's WHO approved.
Oh look, GME pumped and now it's dumping...again. But, it's not a p&d stock now tho, right?

Both
Almost picked up calls earlier when it was down about 
.50 cents......motherfucker
I am surprised Only Fans doesn't have a deliver option.
Wonder if that’d be legal in Vegas…
If you think this was it for GME, you haven't been paying attention
It does this every 3 months like clockwork and I play it wrong every time
This % increase hasn’t happened since March I believe . Usually maxes out at 5-8%
i seriously hope nobody thinks this was "it"

Ok hands up.... how many bulls wandered into that trap?
Bought calls at 1:59pm, sold at 2:01pm for a smooth 20% gain.
Well played..... gotta have your head on a swivel out here!
Maybe -- I'm nervous that I should've held a few in case it goes into full rally into EOD...but I'm gonna take it and be done for the day and just see what happens now...
Enter full rally mode….

lol i bet you thought taperings was bearish. guess again you smelly ber.
Instead of student loan forgiveness how about telling universities to lower their fucking prices
Something JPow said, made the markets add 0.5 percent to SPY / VOO / Blackrock IVV.

Great!   I wish he would say that every day!   1.005^(365) = 6.175, and who doesn't want a safe six-bagger!??
saying it on the weekends doesn't count, double check your math there
1.005^(365*5/7) = 3.67, still pretty good.
SPY 500 by end of year is in play.

Only 7.5% away... any other year that would be 10 months of gains but with how bullish markets are right now?  It could happen...
Why am I awake at this god forsaken hour?
Meth?
Adderall, but close enough
Just bought my all time first Calls (Tesla)... I have two questions:
1* what are those? 
2* I'm gonna be rich? 
3* I'm retarded enough to be here?
You gonna be a broke retard.
Still can sell my Asshole for money :/
Then you will get double fucked
This is when we buy puts.
bit late to buy tesla , wait for pull back to 1000 to buy
Fuck late
But Tesla to 10k :)

This shit is hitting 50 today 🚀😎😬
Unless it’s halted
Are we finally breaking 1200?  Today?
Yes
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Here we go. Another green day on the books
You think tech will pump again?
Why do I have a feeling the market is going to absolutely dump today
Literally one of the strongest potential catalysts for a dump is happening today. It’s not like a wild assumption. Shits a coin toss.
People sure don’t seem worried about the Fed
Vix certainly doesn’t give a fuck
Thanks for picking me up at GME 220! Let’s ride to the moon boyz 🚀
Tesla 1270 EOD
Buy the rumor, buy the news.
Sell the dip
$BB hit 12 game over see you on mars
GME volume isn’t even very high, if volume reached levels like January it could literally hit 500 I think

Correction: 1000 easy
if it ever break 350. its unknown territory, everything is possible.
Great point, kinda like Tesla this past week
add some  zeros to the 500 bro
Lol you might be right, this volume is like not even 5% of what January volume was
HOLY MOLY GME
Very suspicious GME hasn’t had a massive red dildo yet by 10am . It’s usually a guarantee
This not an usual day
GME GAMMA RAMP!
Meme stocks back on the menu. AMC GME
467 bag holders we are coming for you #gme
is that you god....?
GME over 235 now moon shot?
Might run to 300+ today tbh
Holy shit GME above $250 LOL. 

$350 by EOW?
anybody know the level of gme stock need to reach to see old hedge fund boomer crying on tv again? bitching that gme breaks market
$500 plus 30% from FAANG collateral says roughly $650?
AMC is skyrocketing.
i see amc is pumping again
how tf did you guys all know to buy gme today?
People have been spamming GME everyday for the past year
ive been holding since 2020 bro wym
They buy fractional shares of GME every day, they just only talk about it when it goes up
i guess it only takes one day for it to blow up
A broken clock is right twice a day
it was popping

when she runs she rips
It's a meme stock whose price rose $15 yesterday. Lots of people bought at the top thinking the momentum would continue and it did.
Did that dude who was short GME and AMC exit his position? If not I want to see some losses
I never had positions dumbass

I just like throwing peanuts at dumb apes to piss you off. Thanks for making these calls print though
"I was just pretending to be retarded"
The entire time? Quite the long con
It wasn’t you anyway cuck
Friendly reminder to cancel your $250 GME sell orders

Had a serious talk with my wife last night. I laid it all out there. My son is one year old, but told my wife that if I ever catch him later on playing or even thinking about playing with WISH, I will kick him out of our house. She laughed and said it was funny that I thought WISH would still he around long enough for that to happen. Anyhow, BB go to moon.
what happened to ocgn :(
it was a pump and dump, nothing that was happening in terms of WHO news wasn't already priced in.
People sold the news already
Gme round 2 begin!
Round 2? I thought we were at like round 4 by now
Tsla is done for now
Lucid takes over 🚀
Tsla officially topped down hill from here it’s seeming
Thanks Elon 😂😂
HOOD back to 40. They will announce the Shanaya Buba coin
OCGN dry fucked me hard. My ass is still bleeding.
You see the chart yesterday? Same thing today possibly.
I don't even know why I hold GME anymore man, it's just funny to me now
I do in the off chance it des MAOSS I can say I was there
5.50 to 469.00 was the moass, you were already there 🤗
That is the fun part we don't know for sure
Spy puts because he’s going to say taper today?
Everyone thinking the same so prob not
Rippp. Lmao
Sooo many 50% huge movers today... i barely made 500$ lol. I wanna get a 1000% call so bad ahhh
Today is the biggest bull trap, went from up $5k at 10am to down $500 now
Gme?
A bit of GME and CLOV shares, but mostly QS, PLUG and FCEL calls. Looked good this morning but have been tanking since. They’ll continue their run these coming weeks though, we need a  healthy correction anyways
OCGN needs some serious TSLA energy
That stock is dog shit. Always sell the news event.
It has more potential than MRNA but idk if it has the same popularity

More products more sales and higher efficacy and immunocompromised can take it. Maybe becuz it is coming after MRNA it has less excitement
Umm no.  MRNA has real technology and will cure several diseases in the next 10 years.  No comparison.  OCGN was a good buy tho
we all know gme going to back to 250 today lmao.
[deleted]
Except for today 255
Why would you even sell TSLA shares right now. The board meets next week. Last time they did a split they announced it on Aug 11, right after the board met. Might get the announcement as early as this month.
I know right. I don't get it either. You see the posts of people that have held on to it a long time and how much money they've made and then these people are buying and selling them for a $10 gain and some selling at a loss of they had a stop loss order on. Makes no sense. Just buy and hold
GME AH go boom
🌛🔜
Bigly
jpow better start up those printers
Why are you people so fixated on OCGN, there are other biotech plays out there
OCGN? What the fuck is even happening today why are you playing with me like this
The previous 6 times it did this didn’t give you any clue this would happen again?
First time buying and hearing about it actually, and i went full retard 1k+ shares
This. 1000000000x this
Anyone else eyeing Zillow?
Catching the falling knife… ahhh a classic 🤌
when was the last time you posted or used zillow or bought anything from them
Never in my life personally. My parents used them back in 2006 to buy a house. They then used them once more to sell that house before they built a new one. These trading multiples have been ridiculous for multiple companies like Zillow which have no real growth opportunities. They will always be niche with minimal ways to expand profit. This home flipping business was their best bet to get out of that and they fumbled it
I bought a shit ton of vix calls. That means there won't be a sell off. You're all welcome.
SPY gonna brrr soon. I know it cause I saw rocket emojis, a moon, and a money printer in my dream last night
That's cause the moon was behind the rocket where it was headed back towards the money printers on Earth. 📉
how the fuck is this good news?
Come on OCGN how long we have to hold until you moon?
Buy and hold 🍻
I have 1000 now ., I wish I had more money 😝
Nice! Then hold 😁

This pump on SPY is sending me through an existential crisis questioning my life's existence
TSLA GANG IS FUCKING BACK SON
Really Imagine being a bear

All y’all GME haters keep that same energy today
He said as he quickly looked to unload his bags
GME and AMC are on fire! 🔥🔥 Being an AMC shareholder I need to see it pass $60 again soon. Come on AMC!
Oh shit TSLA green boys!!!
Plz

Fed will taper but say with recent economic uncertainty they will keep interest rates unchanged until at least 2023
Powell’s getting ousted, so I don’t see why there’s any purpose in forecasting future monetary policy.
To give the markets a heads-up.  The official fed stance is still rate hikes in 2022. Decision is made by committee, J.Pow is just the head.
Ok
OCGN got approved 5 minutes ago
GME and SOFI, HOP ON 🚀 🚀
GME will drop to $249 like 3 more times before taking off to $300+
GME AMC go 🚀
GME bags getting heavier and heavier and apes getting poorer and poorer. Such is the P&D

Who's buying the Rivian IPO?
I'll have to sell my mouth at the gas station for funds but I've been waiting for this ipo for about a year. Best e truck on the market and great initial reviews.
# Low Volume. This aint looking good folks.
Looks good to me. What did you expect rube?
Could pump rest of the week to make the weekly chart...
jerome aint no snitch
Straight Up!
Haha beat me to it 🤝
Fuck. Tsla puts were a terrible idea
Only thing saving them is the IV rising like crazy right now. At least the ones for a few weeks out. Took a hit but creeping back up even as it sits at 1200
What's that market wide pump? Was it jpow?
> I have no idea.
Wonder how many people have said this in the last year
never buy puts on stocks with retard strength
actually just never buy puts. bad idea
Mom talking about buying the 35k Tesla on a loan.

What 35k Tesla, mom? Elon stopped catering to the poor class 💀
35k in TSLA calls a week ago woulda been quite a few Teslas. Just had to buy TSLA before you buy a Tesla
Yeah. Just had to time the market with money we don't have to afford couple of Teslas.
Ez af
Poor people are just playing victims. All of them!!

Yup

What about the squeeze? None of them even know what it means.
> The squeeze is a term used in trading. It refers to the price of an asset increasing so quickly that there is not enough supply, and it becomes difficult for people who want to sell their holdings at a profit before they lose money on them.
fuck i shouldn’t have invested in a video game company that consistently makes money

should’ve invested in a failing brick n mortar video game store saved by memes instead
It’s not failing if it’s up 40x in 12 months .

Nothing else matters but the price people are willing to pay in this market
it’s been saved by memes which is what i said didn’t i?
Good time to add more in my opinion. I might hop into a long position at this discount.
Sup Tesla puts-gang, where y'all at now?
On the bus to Wendy’s
They're down voting everything and throwing tempter tantrums
Made $3k on my GME calls and I’m done god dammit. No fomo if it goes up more.
Nah, you'll be hella sad if it pumps and those calls go up to like 70k....happened to me the first time around...then I FOMOd and made a million
Yea there was a lot of money to be made just then. I made $200 then sold and bought another call option then lost that $200.

JPOW is totally off the mark on thinking COVID is the reason for lack of employment. 

The Great Resignation was sparked by COVID but it isn't the underlying issue at all. People are pissed off being overworked and underpaid. Inflation isn't helping lmao.
Its amazing how obvious it is to anyone below 60 and anyone older can “discuss why” for months lmao.

We need a whole new govt at this point.

Is it really??
Complete bullshit. Calls on McDonald’s greedy fucka.
Disgusting prices
Facts don’t know why the price of everything there keeps going up I spent 13 dollars yesterday on like a meal and an extra McMuffin I’m not money stacks McGee I go to McDonald’s for cheap shit lmao
McDonald’s, along with a lot of other fast food restaurants, began their shift from the Dollar Menü to the their “gourmet” Menü. They said their dollar Menü was losing profit and most people were spending less due to things simply being 1$. So they made ‘gourmet’ foods to force you to spend more money.
Hiring pay in my town is advertised at $17 for cashiers/cooks and $20 for shift managers.... mall value meals are going to be $15 soon
3.25 for a fucking double cheese burger? I’ll make my own burgers thanks

Closed my puts too soon. But it was easy money.
I always feel like a marathon runner approaching my starting position in premarket. Standing shoulder to shoulder with my fellow degenerate colleges ready to shit post and attempt to make or lose enough money to feel something inside. Good luck to all today!
I think I'm going to quit my job so I can take a mental holiday for 2 months. kinda just want someone to say the wrong thing to trigger me.
I’m thinking of taking 8k out of the market next year and take a 2 month mental summer break next year.
yeah 8k seems like a solid amount. I sell CSPs on GME and that covers my rent. so i'd probably only take like 5k out I think.
Gonna be mad if ocgn rug bully me

Let's do this
Exp?
Puts on zillow

Edit: the housing market has jumped the shark and zillow got caught with its pants down. They are exiting the house flipping business and laying off 25% of workforce. I think it will hit $30 before its done.
What gave it away?
I woke up and notice joe biden was president.
Holy shit, how did you come up with that deep analysis?
Just intelligent like that.  It seems really obvious, but it seems like its still a good bet even though i felt like i got in kind of late on the trade.  I would do it again. Im holding ten january 2021 puts with a $40 strike.
Did you just wake up and read the news lol? This was known yesterday
I was watching economic ninja on youtube. I was a little drunk on tsla success and hopeful for my new investment in dwac.  I averaged down on paypal.  And then i saw that zillow was still a long way from its covid bottom and figured what the hell. Might as well ride the coattails of the great examples.  I sold some sens calls to get the cash to buy the z puts.  Slow on the uptake, yes. Every once in awhile a blind dog finds a bone.

Yeah, and I'm still down nearly 50% on them.
JPow friends almost done loading up on Spy calls so we good to go

and in the $30-40 range pre-covid lol, it's inflated as hell

i will inverse you, one of us will make money 🙂
Get drunk and buy more
I will never understand people who buy 2dte with no way to exit after buying.
Demand through the roof. Supply chain in shambles and can’t catch up. Only going to get worse if Powell doesn’t turn the printers off and raise interest rates



It would get worse if he does that lol. US gov needs to print or debt costs as % will stay where they are / lower slowly. 


Print, and debt costs as % will lower faster. Better.
We’re gonna go way up, way down, or way flat. The anticipation is the only thing that makes me feel alive.
I know we're going right --->

Bears back to their caves, plotting the next BiG cATaLySt 🤡
Lol honestly doesn’t matter what JPOW says. Algos are in control at moment. 06/2020 the market was euphoric before Powell speaking and plunged to hell in a 5 minute span. 

Tread lightly.
I literally don't understand what makes these green dildos. The volume isn't there 🤣
No one is selling.
SPY $465 by Friday? 🧐 feeling good
Zillow is dead. Just gonna assume that cathie woods bought it yesterday.
This is something only a Cathie Wood do

Something about the Fed chair hushing inflation and basically lying every fed meeting saying it's transitory and then doing a 180 saying it's not while simultaneously printing money nonstop doesn't sit right Idk
Are there any bears left?? How many of you do we need to slaughter
i was a bear on z this morning

is that the question?

"How did you get this job working with us other fucking idiots?"
Is SPY hitting 500 in December or January
December baby.
Dec 1st
500 EOD not impossible if Jpow says the right words
EOD ? Impossible

Bears are right in the medium term but for now you need to be in the market ; otherwise you will watch your cash value vaporize.

SPY you slut
This market is so eager just like this dude’s mouth
okay this one is kinda funny.
Pretty sure anyone who bought a home in the last 18 months is going to be underwater in the next 6
Please explain your theory...
zillow went bust flipping homes. Maybe the home market is not going up forever after all.
?? hyper inflated prices from covid, rising interest rates, zillow dumping thousands of homes, evergrande having to sell off assets to avoid default. This has been obvious for some time, what do you not understand
Home buyer in the last 18 months spotted
Nope.
Zillow, and others (BlackRock) rushed in and starting buying homes at whatever price. They intended to flip them to families fleeing cities because of Covid. However, they overpaid thinking they could pass the cost on to consumers. Consumers balked at the prices and now Zillow has inventory it can’t sell. The cure for higher prices are higher prices. Homes are becoming illiquid in the sense no one can afford to buy at these prices
Home prices (around here) have been going up for years. If you think we will have an 08 on your hand. There is a lot of differences. No one is doing 'NINJA' loans, people are putting real money down, inflation is a thing including rising wages. I could actually afford a home now due to my massive raise.
Congrats on raise. I didn’t say 2008 bubble pop, but home values are going down. The prices of homes have priced too many buyers out of the market, creating an illiquid home buying market. Zillow has 7k homes they can’t sell. NINJA loans aren’t a factor and mortgage applications showed healthy credit scores in the last 18 months.

Mortgage rates are also on the rise. No one will sell their existing home for a bigger one if they have to pay a higher mortgage rate. Homes are at ATH and finding a lack of buyers
I'll say that the 10%+ y/y might be gone going forward. But they will rise at 2-3% overall. There might be some pockets still mega hot that will get +5 or some cold ones that will be - 5.
It will be interesting to see it play out. I still stand by my statement that many have been priced out of the housing market. I don’t think the Zillow issue is over. This spells trouble that they have 7k homes they can’t sell and are going to lose money on
Thanks for your analysis
Ya if you overpaid for one, plus interest rates going up over next couple years will even it out a bit
> The current interest rates are actually very low. The average rate is around 3%. It was over 5% in the past few years.
You get a house soon stay after it
Everyone thought that there was a housing bubble that was going to pop around 2018-2019. If you're renting you're literally throwing money away, might as well buy in case it isn't actually a bubble
I never thought that. I thought houses were fairly valued.   I still see a bigger bubble in stocks than homes
Obviously not literally everyone thought that, but it was being discussed on financial media (e.g., CNBC). I waited for that bubble to pop before buying. Obviously it never popped so I should have bought sooner.
So WHO approval for covaxin $ocgn
I hope they approve it
They did lol

Anyone playing today's earnings? EYSY, ROKU, etc..
Play the fed news instead , dip incoming after institutional  algo response like clockwork everytime
SPY puts, then calls after a we go below 450?
 not going below 450.
I'm banking on cvs making a big move up, or a big move down. Frankly I don't care which way it goes just so long as it does it bigly.
straddle?
More or less, 92c, 84p. Really the puts are more a hedge than expecting it to go down significantly. 5% move either direction, up hopefully with pediatric covid vaccinations starting this weekend, and I can at least unfuck my tsla spread loses.
ROKU make me broku. I’ve got calls
241x P/E ratio?   spendy.
What time is BABA earnings? Yahoo says today but I cant find info on when exactly. Honestly Im not sure I even see confirmation that it is today.

I was thinking the same, obviously probably not an Avis type of play, but I was contemplating Vroom calls as well, plus it's fun I vroom up or pull a Henry Ruggs and vroom into the back of someone

Nice try, ain’t nobody buying that pos.
Not a lot of pre market movement on SPY.
Sad....looking like a sideway days to destroy Calls and Puts.
Maybe that haircut rule is why TSLA rocketed
Whats going on with Bed Bath and Beyond this morning, have a few calls in que to make sure I get my daily retardation in but curious if there is any quantifiable reason for this?
they announced that they will be ordering some teslas for their employees
You bought calls before market open huh
🧐
Earnings+shorts+meme stocks kinda rally (probably due to CAR losses for big wigs)
Sold off VMWare.
Announced deal with Kroger. How are you buying calls before market opens? And which calls do you recommend?
I got them in cue for asking price and please, please don't buy any.
Excellent, and here I thought for a second there was some sort of value in any this, which of course would directly oppose my investment strategy, so I guess I'm all in (nothing worse than having enough money to eat the next day and being burden with the decision of what to eat).
And just like that all renewable energy stocks die :(
what is the difference between zillow class a and c? the prices are the same
Different class shares = different voting rights like goog/googl
i see. thank you
What do I drop 60k for stocks
30k on 480-500c dec- feb spy calls. 10k in IWM calls. Keep the rest on hand for buying up the dips if there are any.

You do that and your 60k will be 90-120k in a month or two

What possible reason did you have to think it would go up?
Strong earnings and the company is actually a very strong company with a lot of growth potential. The only reason it has tanked is because of the game delays.
Also people fleeing their products and ongoing litigation. All of the news on them is negitive. They struggle to recycle their most popular games into successful products.
I mean have a look at there finance reports, monthly users their plans for the future.
Anyone playing PENN earnings?

The fact that spy has been essentially flat at ath for days leading up to today, and memes started flying left and right is starting to make me legit concerned
Memes flying for FOMC is usually the top signal
Kind of agree. I know the market expects tapering but normally we get a dip before FOMC anyways and there has been nothing

Same here, all in LEAPS though. Price targets remain in the 270’s. TA shows head and shoulders though. Hopefully it’s just seasonal. For now GUHH!

I did well for months betting against baba. I wouldn't touch it right now though.

Same here, thinking either puts or calls for SPY, 0dte, after the fed meeting
When is this meeting
In 15 mins. Jpow speaks in about 45
MSFT barely atm eow. it will fly
335 call for Friday? Or closer
I have a few 335s for this Friday and next. not financial advice but think its a good move
If the fed meeting goes to shit will spy drag Microsoft down with it? What makes you think Microsoft will go up past it’s ATH this week?
Basically just betting the fed meeting won't go as poorly as people are thinking and we'll have big green days to finish the week. Tapering is priced in and this seems to be FUD to shake retail out
I’ll buy a couple 335’s and maybe some spy calls for Friday before the speech
Sounds logical, best of luck to you!

ppl buying the ATVI dip needs to realize that at the very least, options market aint pricing this to move very much in the next few years.

yeah analysts could be wrong with their model and blizzard will turn it around and delivery overwatch 2, diablo, and activison will stop sucking ballz

but Jan 2024 $70c is only going for around $10 - which seems cheap, until you realize that's two fucking years and the option market only thinks the underlying will grow 18%

that's terrible for a stock in this specific sector.

if you're buying near term calls for a technical bounce etc then wait till IV settles imo but that's just me

tapering as market knew about incoming tapering for many weeks now.
It's not the event, it's the *scale*. Canada didn't taper, they just killed QE in a single suprise blow. If the taper is anything but mild the market will react as if JPow animorphed into a hawk right on stage.

I think B&M retail is stupid cheap; they'll have a ton of pricing power going into xmas. A lot of them were dragged down with the crappy BBBY earnings report even though they're all not directly comparable.

Something like SFIX has to get past people wanting to see and try clothes on before they buy them. I could see a B&M retailer acquiring them.
Sounds good, I'll look into that

Is being up 19% YTD on 401k good? Up 38% over past 1 year. Should it be more aggressive even if it’s somewhat close to matching S&P500 returns?
Leave your 401k alone - make risky plays in a brokerage account.
Company matched and managed 401ks are the most boomer ass shit ever that it makes the s&p look high risk. Good returns.
I’m up 48% in my Roth IRA last 12 months. I have 98% diversified across dividends, VGT, VOO, and a few other safe stocks. 2% is for risky plays occasionally and I bagged 2k from OCGN before it dumped :)
Nice! I just opened Roth a few months ago, a lot more aggressive than my 401k, but with no individual stocks. Hoping to see gains like that in my future
Why is ATVI not moving what the hell
this is VERY common on days when a stock gets hammered. 

it won’t go up till the next day or even later

Let's say you're playing ER and it goes your way, does IV crush always happen at the open?

Today I paper handed my $Z puts and really regretting it.
Yes, it will still affect prices even if it’s itm
Yes almost always, unless the move is astronomical but if IV will still go down and your option value will be mostly intrinsic.
I mentioned a few weeks ago that I bought a ton (like a lot) of a couple penny stocks. Not naming them, but fucking guitar lessons ftw. Idiotic success like this is why I switch between accountants - can't let them steal my big brain ideas.
Accountants? 

You don't just trade from your phone on the couch with your dog and laugh at the world?
I don't have a dog. Or a sense of humor. The rest is accurate, but my accountants sit on their couches too, so it's cool.

Consolidation before tendie town
i hope zillow rallies just a wee bit to bring down these put prices
Someone keeps trying to pump it.  it pops +$.50 for no reason and then trends back down.  Seen it happen a couple times in the last hour.
yeah i was trying to time those, ended up buying a bunch of puts at not an ideal price but i hope by eod and after jpow it drills even more
Mm Kate lookin good in the purple 🤤

z puts
Could have been richer by $6500 in my 401k if I sold Z and PYPL on time. Booked -$2700 on Z shares and -$1800 on PYPL till now. Although going to hold PYPL for long. Unlike Z it’s a solid company. 😔😔😔

“Inflation largely transitory but still reduction by $15B in bond purchases starting Nov”
wait so the fed is increasing treasury purchases and that's bullish? isn't that basically saying they are anticipating an economic downturn and will allocate capital to safer investments?
bro they are printing more money - stonks go up

I almost went full degenerate and bought some 0dte calls about 15 minutes ago. 

Maybe I should let the degenerate make some choices occasionally
What did jpow say?
"eatmatesticles"
Nothing yet, presser in 20mins
Said FOMC is bunk; the party is still going on.
Santa claus rally time 🚀
I hope my spy puts go to zero. Willing to sacrifice to protect the other calls.
Jpow hasn’t even spoken
The minutes tell us what he’s going to say. I don’t think an interview is going to make much of a difference this time.
Minutes are out though on the Fed website. No mention of tapering yet
Going all in 500c for Dec, this investing shit is actually easy AF
So is GME and TSLA call going to print so I can finally feed the needy
Good rationale. Takes my greed completely out of it. Trying to help the world over here!
Algos just engaged "Feint into strong uppercut" on retail buyers.
I bought calls on the massive dildos Bc they’re just going to continue going up. That’s confidence.
How we feeling about MTTR earnings fellas? I got a deep ITM call for 3/22. Thinking about switching to shares
AMZN with that hulk dick
What the fuck is going on with spy? Pre-tapering tampering?
Fed asset purchases will end by June of 2022.
Fucking Fed.  From inflation is trANsItORy to actually we like it, and now want it high for a long time so that everyone fucking knows we like it and expectations are anchored there.
Absolute morons. I've been saying the whole time it's not transitory. These cucks will destroy our economy
They don't care, they'll let inflation completely ass rape the poor and average American.
Do the humpty dump do the humpy dump

literally no sign it's turning around so no
Wait until 205 but if you're impatient, go for it.
Why 205? Lol
decent support around 204-205, doesn't mean it'll drop down there though so if you don't want to miss out on a possible run, buy now
F to 18.60 end of day
Ouch, my balls
FSLY put IV is at 110%. how fucked would I be if the stock doesn't go down a lot on earnings.
bigly fucked
You'll probably be fucked even if it does go down
yeah the risk isn't worth it. gonna sell them now I guess.
Depends on the average IV of those contracts. Looks at contracts for next week, what's their IV? Doesn't need to make a huge move, 2 percent would hold value
the 110% IV are for puts expiring november 19th. the ones expiring this week are at 220% lol
I have puts 50 strike that’s not terrible IV. Crush happens when it’s in the 200s or more and then flat
Some MM probably hit the buy button instead of sell.
There you have it boys.  Inflation is here to stay, because now we're "anchoring" expectations.  Inflation is wonderful so since it was below 2% for so long, having it above is how you average it nicely.

ATVI just got upgraded lol. Happy for these calls doe
jpow: I don't see a way to stop climate change by printing money but if you can think of a way let me know
TSLA up because reasons?

![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Told you Spy 465 just too easy. Loading more calls for gap up tomorrow
Yessir just got some 465 calls I think we hitting 470 for sure

True, we should start loading up on bads
Which one of you bought Avis at $545 yesterday?
Anyone have TSLA puts?
Ya….
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
LOL yeah, BTFO -43%
this maeket doesnt give a fuck
Does anyone even know why they are buying?
> I know why I'm buying.
Because - come bad news, good news, or no news - shit keeps going up. 

To expand a bit: what else will they do with their cash?  Sit in it and let inflation nibble away while watching stonks continue to rise?
JPOW really said fetch the toner
If you didn’t buy the TSLA dip yesterday, you hate money lol
100k DEEP IN CALLS
Hold SPY calls through tomorrow or offload today?
I’m trying to figure that out myself
I'm exiting my futures near close. Spy will probably go down tomorrow, it's a bit high on this news I think. 2 months out still bullish, I'm holding my leaps.
Seems like a good call. Just exited my calls, still holding a put position expiring 11/12
Is SENS a meme stock? I have no idea.
Tsla cruising
My SOFI Jan 2023 20C Leaps are up 96%.. I'm reluctantly putting a sell order for 1/3 of them at 100% gain.
Don’t… i sold my leaps for 150-200% gain last week

They are up another 150% already…
> I'm sorry.
I have to... Right now it's like 6% of my total portfolio and 20% of the cash portion of my portfolio. need to not be greedy and de-risk.
Closed my disastrous $ATVI put bet. Ouch! Violated my own rule and got slapped.

Rolled all my $SPY put positions to Jan 23 $460 strike.

Standing pat on the rest.
Which rule was that?
Imagine buying GME at 250 when you could have made bank with SPY 0dte’s
Seems like the Fed looked at the Weimar Republic and was like yeah that looks like a good idea
stop saying inflation!!!
I’m too much of a paper-handed trader to do options anymore
ya i learned the hard way you have to be able to hold to make money. even when every instinct tells you to sell you need to stick to the plan.
So about that tesla stock split
goddammit gme what a tease
Spy 490 500 520

Would you hold spy $463c 2dte calls overnight?

No, but I also didn’t think that I would be purchasing OTM 460P today
I am I have 3
Hey Jeffrey AMZN stock split when
When TSLA catches them in market cap
When do i sell my Spy calls that are in the money but expire in jan 2022?
Tapering increases gold price, just saying
used to - just saying
Grabbed 465 calls .13 for scalp
as much as I want to, I’m not gonna risk it with tsla here. my fb & msft calls are printing and I want to end today on a good note. tired of my account being stagnant over the past few days cuz of dumb plays
Blindfold yourself with Robinhood open and just start touching your screen and you’ll make money in this market. I know that’s true because it’s really similar to my own strategy
anyone playing MP earnings? 70% IV on cheap premium for 40 calls
now you understand the meaning of power hour, power it through
If you haven’t seen what shit looks like, peep the Vix
Dang. |We are pretty due for a spike to 20....but I ain't gonna bet on it.
Probably 2-3 weeks.
Dip during FOMC means FOMO, right?

The fact that ALL these news outlets continue to single out FB about privacy and data over Google, Microsoft, or Apple is why I’m all in FB.
Sad I missed out on today’s TSLA run but already I loaded up on spy calls earlier 🤩
Ive been so stuck on GME I didnt realize SPY brrrrrrr'd too
[deleted]
Bought some ITM for a few months out. Given how dovish the fed is, we might get the most memorable and retarded bull market for November and December.
They have been up for weeks.  Dont mind

Tempted to play ROKU earnings. Would do puts but gonna abstain this time.

Zillow you're moving in the wrong direction
Lemonade is expanding to car insurance CEO going on CNBC next
lol I had puts all the way up and when I finally capitulated and bought calls thinking we were really just gonna fly all the way in to close we immediately drop 40 cents. Love it
Market was flat all day till jpow whipped out the printer 😂

WHO approves Covaxin vaccine for emergency use. $OCGN next stop, the moon 🚀
I’ll spit shine a barrel full of knobs if TSLA crosses 1200 today
Only one knob is you do me first. Depending the size of the barrel ofc
BBBY accumulating at 26 premarket, gonna be fun at open
Is it gonna crash ?
yea but it might sky rocket. might also stay the same or marginally increase. or maybe even marginally decrease
Fuck it

BBBY to the moon boys?
Bb, amc gme 🚀 🌝
We’re due for a rally. Right?
Not gonna lie BB is going to take off today

Oh look the OCGN pump spam on here all morning turned out to be horseshit, what a surprise.
Heyyyyy… swaps are back on the table! 

GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I'm not saying this is the GME squeeze....but....if it is these prices are still very cheap.
If you bought OCGN at $17 don’t worry. We’re coming back for you bros.
Thank fuck I didn’t buy OCGN like you retards said
I listened to them :(

Nah, the MMs see and switch it up
GME the original gangster may as well jump on.
Oof, wait until it's like 165-170.
I challenged myself to stop being greedy and take profits... now I'm closing positions at 50% just to miss out on 100% and it feels bad. But I'm not losing money.
This is the trick. Teach yourself that it's okay to miss out on more to secure the bag. Just close out of your position, take the ticker off your watch list, and find another play.
I can't argue with the results it is producing and there is always, always another play.

I missed out on another 50% with AMC this morning, but I'm pretty sure if I would have held, I'd be worse off right about now.

On the other hand AMD just keeps going up. Any thoughts on jumping back in on the same ticker?
Why half the sub haiting on GME like they didnt just show up here when it first started popping off in Jan
I love the movie Gremlins but I would vomit if I had to watch it a million times
I hate the apes.
Yep.  We should have had a backup plan.  Every sub needs a bugout plan for if/when their sub gets popular and overrun.
Does anyone know OCGN's safe word? Because I'm getting fucked way too hard right now.
same like wtf it opened around 17 holy shit

Have the Apes complained about ShOrT LadDeR aTtAckS yet today? Lol

Tired of all the bullshit, wbu?
Same just hope to get through the day without problems
Good luck friend
Ehh, not dead I guess. Yet
Ocgn too low. Tf is this small pp
In 1.5 hours that won't be the case.

Would you date a girl Thats not your type if she has 10k shres of tesla
Im nutting in that
Dude i known its no nut November but go take a cold shower
Cathie has some other baggage too tho
Having 10k shares of tsla makes a girl my type
Depends how "not my type" she is. I know my ex's inheritance is about 6+ mil, and her dad is already in his 70s. But no fucking way I'd date her again
Just marry her for a couple years. Easy money.
For a couple months yeah. Let her shower me with gifts and affection. Also, if she's not a looker, I bet she's a cooker.  Some of the least attractive women I've been with sure do know how to prepare a tasty meal.

Can’t believe I fell for GME of all stocks
Notice how shrills left the minute it started going down?

People with calls selling. Probably gonna be a lot of "gme gain" porn later. Peeps bragging about wins when people like you get stuck with bags
FOMO is a hell of a drug
Went to a friends house, in his bathroom and there's like  toothbrushes everywhere. Must be like 4 or 5 there. I go back to him like man wtf? He's acting like its completely normal. Every single person in his house has their own toothbrush. Am I poor or wth?
Did he have a tv in his bathroom?
U r poor and creepy for checking ppl's toothbrushes
Does every person in your house not have their own toothbrush
I used to get my brother's hand me down toothbrush, so we each had our own.
Everytime Powell talks, the market dies. Don't get too excited

It’s 100% sell the news. I’m in, but this is just hype until it’s actually approved in US/CAN. Sling options, hold shares.

Free money hack for the striking Deere workers:

1) Take out puts every time the stock rallies on "tentative deal struck" news

2) Reject tentative deal with vote

3) stock crumbles - sell puts

4) rinse and repeat. never have to return to work again 😏
> You are a fucking idiot.
VisualMod is out of control. Must be puberty
Free money hack 

1. Buy SPY/QQQ calls every time it dips 5%
The trade better be worthwhile because That's not bargaining in good faith and will lead to ULP's
I think that’s illegal.
To anyone buying puts rn let me clarify this:

Fed sells at the top and SPY dips all the way to $427.

On Friday these abnormal buy orders I noticed (on no news)

2.49 mil buy order 12:20

2.84 mil buy order 3:50

1.04 mil buy order 4

Then yesterday afterhours noticed another 250k+ buy order
yeah, imagine not thinking this is priced in rn lol
Seriously, I've been constantly bombarded with "markets may tank because FMOC meeting this week" on CNBC. Basically CNBC's bull sign only second to this guy![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Just wanna inspire fear in retail so they can scoop more up for cheaper and sell to us again once the FOMO pumps start
Fucking called it
isn't my first rode lol
Tapering priced in

Inflation priced in

Global warming priced in

Aliens are real priced in
Knowing there is a bear right now crying and rage downvoting in here makes me feel warm inside. Post your loss porn you coward.
There is HEAVY downvoting going on right now.

I'm a 🌈 🐻 and have to admit that conference was insanely bullish.

Is it absurd how little he gives af about inflation?  Yes.  But that's the public story, what the Fed does has nothing to do with "supply constraints."  Apparently stimulus doesn't actually create demand, who knew.
IS THERE NO ONE ELSE?!
Ugh they keep pushing back infrastructure
Pinterst is going to crash so hard tomorrow, literally easy money buying puts on them

Holding 350 shares. Selling at 15% if it ever gets there lol
I'm holding 80 and I'm already up 20%. Might wait until Later to sell if it breaks into the 18's
Everyone get in here it’s happening again
Tesla can only go up after these dips
GME SHES RUNNING running 🏃‍♀️
GME with the foreplay ;)
I bought one GME call and one OCGN put this morning, I’m up over $1000 already!
Oh Apes already took over this thread
What the fuck is going on with GME volume today
It’s pretty light volume honestly, only 2.5% of the volume we saw in January
Wow I’m up $890 on my GME calls do I sell I’ll be marked as a pattern day trader though
Take money.

Either open a different account at brokerage or bend over backwards at your current one to lift the ptd.
Hold!!
Nope wait till tomorrow
People buying GME 300c at the peak....Theta Gang be like How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old apeman
Huh, GME didn't tank yet in the 30 minutes since I got a 11/5 call. It might actually hold this price
The spread on GME..
Crazy hunh?  I thought about getting a bear call spread but the difference between bid/ask is rediculous.
So it goes with GME spreads. I’ve been wanting to trade them (bear and bull at various times over last few months) but the spread is often more than a dollar or two. Surprisingly, the spreads are much tighter on AMC. I pulled a quick 90% gain on a 40/45 spread overnight with virtually no liquidity issues
I made a ton on AMC spreads in July, but lost a ton on the same, end of August.  Net was +500 so I guess I can't complain.  But that's the price of playing the memes.
LCID $38C 11/12 will print
My 290c gme was up 100% just earlier. I didn’t have the balls to sell and be labeled a pdt. Now we slippin. Hoping we get some autist momentum later to save me xD
Look back at the chart, this Jawn never goes straight up smooth
welcome ocgn baghodlers !!!  Glad I dumped at 17
Long way down before I'm not in profit. Holding for the next milestone
It’s going up. I’m still holding
Glad i didn't fomo in last night before close
still hasnt come down past the pullback from yesterday morning. I think it looks healthy right now on the 1h, personally
I might get back in at 10.  This shit isnt running right.  If there were real excitement this shit would be at 20.  This is just another pump and dump
$SDC is flying today
This is just the engine check
Yessir. I’m ready for blast off tomorrow
I sold half my OCGN calls for a good profit, then bagheld the rest, breaking even. Can't believe I fell for it again. This stock is always a piece of shit
MM playing games. Best vaccine in the world it will not stay down long. SMH, you will be glad you held half.
Absolutely not the best vaccine in the world by a longshot lmfao
Sold my GME 11/5 calls at the top. Just picked up more 11/12 $250 calls
Wish I had sold higher. Dropped up about halfway down. Still made 300%. Waiting for a good sign it'll start up as gain before getting in on some 11/12c
Looks like support at 225
Smart - taps head
Tesla you can do better than this.  You’re screwing calls and puts
BBBY got room to run? Should I buy in?
i mean mite as well baghold another memestock
Can someone please answer this question about OCGN...

WTF?
I’ll answer that with a question for you. Fill in the blank. 

Buy the rumor, sell the ______
Booze
Sure: OCGN
Sold my gme options this morning but I am getting severe fomo right now
Why? It’s consolidating. Highly doubt it’ll make another break.
Cuz I like money and lack rational thought process? One mistake I catch myself making a lot is going back to my winners over and over until they turn into losers
I mean did you think it was going to make a break this morning? If not then what you think is irrelevant since you're just guessing.
It did make a break this morning... and yes I thought it would because it broke 218 resistance in AH last night.
What is you doing TSLA-bro?
Puts work
Wasn’t BBBY up 80% after hours? Lmaoooooooo ultimate cock tease
Almost as if it’s a meme.

TSLA about to take a dump
A big stinky dump
Fuck you I ain’t buying PUTS

**Steve Eisman** from 'Big Short' was absolutely 100% correct about Zillow short

**The only problem it was in August 2019 when Zillow was $40 a share** hahah

but he was spot on about the Zillow flipping model failing (towards the end of this interview):

Nothing is even calm. Market is consolidating with low volume and tons of cash on side waiting for a FED decision and a direction before piling in (either way). 2:30ish EST.
FLY HIGHER TESLA BRING US BLESSINGS. FORGIVE OUR SINS
Diamond handing these SPY calls let’s keep it going up
diamond handing my puts, may the biggest tard win
have 2k and need a play expiring friday that can get me to 10k. please help
spy 463c
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
You really are an autist. You think whatever they’re going to say is going to send SPY up $3.45 by 3pm today for 0dte? Or by $8.45 come Friday if you’re playing 11/5
Yeah
That’s what I thought
You were damn close. Impressive. Still not enough to get them to 10k, but wow. That was a rally
SPY is soaking, waiting for JPow to do the jumphump thing
All i want is a little 1% drop, so I can switch back to calls. Is that too hard JPow
Fomo gonna be crazy tomorrow
Cash App for Teens? Damn. Is everyone targeting teens before they even hit puberty? jesus.

Knock it out the park JPOW!!!
Looks like HOOD going back to 40
Fuck yea.
Wow SPY big dump, more in store?????????
Spy gonna tank down to 459 during 2-2:30 and then climb back up to 462 where by 4pm it will close at 461. You are welcome
What about VIX, Sherlock?
Small spike then dip till close
Papa Pow knows not to panic shit. He’s not going to hike fast.

Hopefully
Yahoo finance “Fed to slow its pace of asset purchases this month” 

Thanks breaking news? They’ve been saying it for months. It’s the exact opposite of breaking news.
Hulk dick reaction in market says otherwise
us 10 year skyrocketing
I want to ask.... how does spy do that thing where it only goes up?
> Spy is a bot.
USA mofo
Anti gravity device
SPY goes up every time  there is a “America Bad” post
what the fuck’s going on
Tapering but not tapering enough. Stonks go Up!
Always buy calls for fomc earnings. Free money.
Fomc earnings lmao
Of course its priced in ...what did you ecpect
tsla is gonna hit the gas soon. if I had day trades on this account I would absolutely get in asap.
JPow looks defeated
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
its time to taper, but not time to raise interest rates

what does that mean? bullish? bearish? iron condorish?
short term bullish
he wants to save that tool for later
Bearish for long dated government bonds.
Bullish. Economy is getting stronger. Still cheap to borrow.
Doesn't this thing always tank after JPow is done talking?
When he starts, usually.
NEW ALL TIME HIGH FUCK YOU BEEEEEEAAAAAAARS
This dude at work literally can’t do a task without making it take 10x what it should. Keeps stopping to tell stories, jokes, saying hi to random people. Fuck I’m annoyed.
He makes more than you
Have you tried telling him?
I just try to keep him on track by saying shit like “oh is it not working” and “what part are you at again”. That usually gets him moving again. But Fuck, he’s grown.
Ask I’m if he bought spy calls he might not need the job anymore ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
JPow could talk his way out of anything. He must have been a lawyer at some point in his career
Man I really suck at options and not committing to the plan. 

Bought SPY 463c yesterday, sold for a small loss & switched to puts literally 10mins before this run up. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)

Fucking Christ TSLA... sold most of my calls earlier
Is BB still a thing?
Yes. Probably half this sub owns at least some. Out of all the meme stocks it basically never gets trash talked, meaning most people BBelieve in it eventually.
My F calls for January are printing. Been bagholding since march
Everyday is melt up day.
Guess who held onto their AMZN call. This guy

is 215 max pain for gme options or something? seems pegged to it
The answer is no, but I have no other information. on why it seems that way.
Is it possible that everyone just quit their jobs to trade stocks/crypto? I know I did but I’m also rich and a felon
Are those two things related?
I was addressing my case specifically
JPow: The labor market is confusing.

All you autists not going to work and just staying at home day trading is messing with JPow's head lol.
JPOW: “Your puts are illegal”
RIP TSLA SHORTS
(again)

.........and again.
TSLA back to ATH.

I knew my calls were safe.

Ford to the fuckin' moon!
These last 20 minutes will tell us whether bears are gonna be resurrected.
They ☠️
I assume so, but it’s important to watch instead of just assume or believe.
Assume? Spy is up .5%
And how fast did that happen? I got calls baby, I know just exactly how quick a .5% pump can turn into a pile of slushy shit.
Does it look like it will, today will be the 60th record high close this year on S&P

Three times in history has that happened, each time a 4 year bull run commences
Spy 500 by January
Dec baby
ROKU is broku.

Lmao bears are dead....4 more years
Lawd gme was a bulltrap. New bag holders at 250+ lmao
You see most are FOMO'ing in OTM options that will expire worthless , so they can't even baghold.
My new bags at $245...LOL...I never learn with memes
I had a stop loss. Took a deficit.. couldnt risk bagholding this
Buy the dip sell the rip every time on this.
What the fuck is going on

I did, I bought puts when it was at $17.80 I’m up about 25% already haha
🙋‍♂️☹️
I bought 5 shares...lol just to see my ticker move
I did. I lost $400, instantly. As in the moment I bought.
GME bottom is in for the day, time to go back up 🚀
OCGN is apparently gonna have a face ripping day.
Good day to play both ends for profit
Agreed, probably a good idea to try and get in the middle so you know you make profit since it will probably be a wide range today
Sold a csp on it yesterday. Will be a good day to collect more premium
Go up OCGN
**OCGN  Little dip before huge rip!  $55 EOD.**
Yes. Let the people sell they will regret later
I don't understand GME and I'll never will...
Just think, all you need to do is learn how to read
Me neither, but I'm here for it

Tomorrow is gonna be so green I can feel it
Another batch of GME bagholders soon to be born.
The year is 2040. PYPL just had their 4Q earnings showing over 1 Trillion dollars in revenue. The stock dips slightly to $225 because of the late report of them thinking about buying Pinterest

$BBBY market makers, some of you are alright, don't come to the market today
One of the first shares i bout was BBBY. Was trying to buy 1 share of best buy to get started. Anyways glad to see that one share of BBBY moon
Floor at 200,000,000
OCGN going to have a day baby! EUL approved. Premarket Sheboygan’s happening now but it’s going to soar on open.
Shenanigans?
Autocorrect got me but I do like Sheboygan as a secondary
Free money : buy puts on $PINS, its crashing back sub 20$ after ER trust me
Got any insights? The only news I see looks positive.
serious ? everybody is selling $PINS, big money no longer believes in it, and it has a melting userbase
Definitely did it last time. Why you think it will happen again?
melting userbase, ceo dumping all his shares, and everybody is dumping PINS ( big money i mean look at ARK for example )
Will think about this one. It dumped after last ER even with an earnings beat because of a declining user base.
Okay bet
So tell me toilet gang, what has your toilet foretold about the market today?
Had a solid, healthy shit after about 2 weeks of semisolid liquid fire, indicators are bullish.

Jpow is an American hero
..until you realize that the inflation he caused acts as a regressive tax, hitting the poor and middle classes the hardest, and funneling that money to the rich via asset inflation.
If he didn't do this you wouldn't have a stock market during/after the pandemic , take your pick
There's money to be made in up markets and down markets.  Comes down to the question of is this a free market or not?  My pick is leave shit alone and don't exacerbate financial crises for large swaths of the most vulnerable populations.
> The Great Depression was caused by the Federal Reserve System, which is a central bank.
Bruh, do you understand that companies would go bankrupt, people would lose jobs , crime would hit the roof and civil unrest would be the outcome. You can't leave something like that and hope for the best. Give him credit for what he's done, easy for us to talk a good game .
In a free market, bankrupt companies get sold in pieces to the highest bidder.  I'm sorry, I thought this was America.
Yes and that's what should happen when a company fails due to its own fault. You gonna blame a hotel for failing during covid? , an airline?, a gymn? Etc etc 

Emergency times call for emergency steps, it wasn't these companies faults and least of all the people that worked there
you're conflating low interest rates (j.pow) with emergency stimulus (trump).  I'm no trump fan, but I agree that emergency stimulus was necessary for the examples that you mentioned.

propping up the stock market due by keeping rates low was not an emergency response to covid. it was an emergency response to the fears of a massive voting block (boomers).
If you didn't have low interest rates companies wouldn't borrow, it all goes back to the same deal.
most companies were, and still are, sitting on a massive amount of capital.  driving the cost of debt down was unnecessary and politically-driven.
That shits gonna happen anyway, it’s built into the system
Feels like the bears are going to get it today.
Who is selling their Z puts at open and who is seeing how much further it dips?

GME mooning on no Volume. You guys don't learn. Welcome soon to be Cultists
Way more volume then usual. You don't know shit really
>Way more volume then usual

Because GME volume is always shit since the squeeze. 
If it can Moon on 1 Mil Vol it can get fucked the same way.
True enough. But apes have direct registered a shitload of shares and will diamond diamond for the moon that's probably never coming. I'll use a trialing and enjoy my potentially 20k day already
Apes didn't even register 1% of the oustanding shares. You need to get out of your Echochamber and look at the cold facts.

Since when has that stopped a ticker on wsb?
Big facts unfortunately
TLRY is ready to EXPLODE!
Reddit has a new paid team called Anti-Evil Operations which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words? What's a bad word, for that matter, what's a good word. I thought they were all just words.

ngl spy puts should be on deck
Hot damn BIRD is kicking some ass
Can we get a bit of a SPY pump before the meeting? I want cheaper puts
Just spotted JPOW in Wendy’s. We all know what that means…
Feel like another gme spike will happen before close. What do you guys think
Cathy Wood's strategy is to buy the dip on EVERY stock
Her strategy is to ride elons coat tails.  Like many of us.
Atvi calls seem too easy
I got 1/21 $70c
picked up a couple Jan 72.5s - this seems like a couple grand being given away for free.
That’s what I’m saying. Hoping it doesn’t continue to tank
i will buy PYPL at 220
Markets already beginning to taper lol

Get your VIX calls ready
When has the market ever sold off due to Jpow? Years ago (2018)? And he got chewed out by EVERYONE for that. Jpow knows the same ppl begging him to hike rates will also blame him when the market crashes due to him hiking rates. Jpow will talk about how inflation is still transitory, he will taper "soon" (but not this month) and that everything is good and fine, including this asset bubble, which is fine and transitory
Are you serious? It happened around June 2020. Market was mooning and crashed to hell within a 5 minute window.
Yeah I’ve definitely seen it happen more than once. What’s weird to me is that there was no dip leading up to this. There almost always has been recently when he talks which makes me think the upside is limited but the downside is massive all depending on what he says.
The amount of GME bull traps the past few months.. GUH
Zillow has been massacred
WTF TSLA, we are not done yet
Someone give me a ticker that can 50x my portfolio by EOD
Easy! That ticker would be (user has been disconnected)
GUH

this is the season of puts make ur money while u can
History is not on your side
Everyone is buying puts, I buy calls. This market is so retarded, that whatever happens we'll get a relief rally. Lol
OCGN earnings on 9 nov. there is going to be another big run up, it’s COVAX news is getting approved by literally everybody. Buy a 60 day call and sell weeklies
Cathie getting wet seeing Z down 20%. She's probably buying a shitton of shares as we speak. We'll find out about it EOD when she sends her email thing.
Nah, she's only into profitable companies like TDOC and PLTR.... heh
Z's like a $30 stock considering it has nothing that makes money or has a competitive edge in a stagnant/declining market
Spy puts are gonna wreck me I feel it
don't do it.

pls
Last call to get in ROOT before shorts have to cover 60% of float. About to V shape
They’ve been saying this since august. Why now?
Look at the $7.5C 11/19 Open interest and the short data. Will make sense. Someone is shorting like 19K contracts.
I’m in but if you’re wrong you have to tell me where you live
Not wrong, bouncing off of support
Breaking News:

Printer broke
Remember in may when they said they weren’t going to taper this year and SPY dropped 19 points. Can’t wait for them to actively talk about it and watch SPY rip to 465
I heard PYPL is a white supremacist organization
RIP 0dte Spy calls 

Fuck you MM
You decided to play 0DTE Spy calls on the day Feds have a meeting for interest rates? Wow, you’re a special kind of person…
> Yes.
You belong here 

Buying Spy calls 0dte on JPOW DAYS 💀💀💀🤡🤡🤡
I had to buy a few cheap puts, just in case y'know? 👀
TSLA took a break to lower the RSI but its ready to go back up
I'm sure BlackRock read your comment and is now adjusting its algorithms accordingly
Daddy JPow about to make this market pop in an hour! 🚀🚀🚀
Yo to the dickhead that keeps buying Zillow, STOP
Yeah, let that bitch die. I want my puts to print and also cheap houses to buy. Zillow deserves it
That is **CATHIE** to you! Not dickhead
My coworker said she got high as fuck from the Covid vaccine tf
She likes attention
Pretty typical of firmware updates.
I had the same thing. Lasted about 3 hours. It's the side effect lottery winner.
Don’t you fucking give me hope OCGN
LFG!
It was 7 cents away from my stop when it turned.
Jerome pls don’t say something stupid
Low volume spy its gonna pick a direction during fed meeting
Volume👏doesn't👏matter
When does the old man speak
1 hour
And I will continue to buy Tesla
Maybe it’s all priced in…
is there a livestream of jpow fucking my calls?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd40XFQwG3o
Thanks I love to watch myself get fucked on the internet.
No nut november isn't as painful as this 2pm fed drop
I do NOFAP and I’m on day 91. Don’t be a pussy and keep going with nnn. I’ve been doing nnn for 3 months basically
Ya Allah, did you mean to visit r/MuslimNoFap? In challah you will be victorious.

"life is transitory, push print" - JPow
cash gang until jpow speaks
I thought tapering was bad so why sp500 go up ?
it's been priced in for awhile
Inflation is way worse than tapering
Did you guys just see that massive green SPY jump?  I think someone knows something...
Fed statement released - Printer on overdrive..... for now
😂🤡
“Vix still too high IMO” - Jerome
Bears never learn 😂
Everyone thinks they’re Burry buying puts trying to call a top lol
Yes, endlessly buying calls to try to time a bottom is much higher IQ

Stfu and try to make money
endlessly buying calls has been the right move for a year and a half. what point are you trying to make?
Reread the thread and you'll see that I said nothing about whether the plays were right or not.
reread the thread and youll see that no one made the argument that buying calls was high iq.
> Everyone thinks they’re Burry buying puts 

 
How do you interpret that
i read that the only way it can be read, bers r dum n fuk.
Today was the earnings day for SPY. As always it beat estimates.
Sooo… COIN to $400?
Finally. Something we can all agree on.
a nothing burger.. bers r fuk
lololololl

Buying SPY puts because you thought the taper would bring red.  Uhhhh no...that'd be too obvious.  That's been priced in for forever.  Tapering announcement finally removed cloudiness about its timing.  We finally can move on.  That's why the market returned a Shrek dong after it was announced that JPow is tapering.
I told you guys yesterday to buy spy calls smh
show us your positions
I have 468c, and 470c 11/5 and 470c 11/12 and a small amount of 450p 11/5 just in case it doesn’t go my way
Permabull checking in.. just bought a few puts on SPY. Why do I feel so dirty? why do I immediately regret what I just did?
Permabulls don't buy puts you impostor
Idk why you did.

JPOW didn't say anything negative.
he's losing it, knows these are not truths and his brain is having issues
Bears sitting around with voodoo dolls of JPowl sticking needles in his eyes and praying he says inflation is not transitory
JPOW has our back all in calls
"IF YOU LOST MONEY TODAY...YOU BELONG HERE RETARD" JPOW THE BER
JESÚS FUCK POOR BEARS
THINK ABOUT THE BEARS, GIVE EM SOME TIME TO RECOVER THEIR ANUS
Prolapse is lifelong disability
Bears will be dancing tomorrow morning, I guarantee it.
The lesson of the day: 

Markets can behave irrational longer than you can remain solvent.
SPY short squeeze?? Lmfaooo SPY does not give a fuck PUMP IT UP
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

SPY bears in shambles
Yes Daddy Powell, more green dildo pls.  


BEAR ARE FUCKED
Can I get a power hour in the house for SPY
Did you mean to say Powell Hour?

Cuz inflation is not a bug, working as intended.
20k > 30k > 11k

cut losses and restart? feeling LOW
maybe stop buying puts
why are you not holding spy puts
TSLA 1500 eow!!!
Jerome: “who the hell let that hippie in?”
C'mon JP, just say '' Fuck your puts '' and walk off stage. We've heard enough
i always downplayed my parents success because boomers had the economy on easy mode from 1960-2008 when mortgages were easy to get 

but i know now that the millenial covid generation is currently balls deep in the easiest, sweetest asset and securities bubble in american history

i feel it in my plums. jerome is my god
Ford and Victoria Secret calls are free money printers
Everything going up but memes
Jerome just gave a shoutout to cashflow
SPY 500 by Christmas !
Looks like markets love that tapering announcement.

Fed should do it more often ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
JPOW wanted to see SPY to hit 500.  SPY500

This is the news u need today
Lmaoooooooooo Jerome shut him the fuck down
That 🌈🐻 with 🍏disciple in his flair got awfully quiet after NVDA went green 😂
JPow conference in summary: brrrr
So, are these way otm FD's on F going to start waking up?
#Twelve hundred twenth four & ninety cents

Will be a new ATH for TSLA
Tsla to the moon Tsla to 1250 tomm
Shits so bullish, even PYPL might end green
Wow November really just going to rip huh?
I have opened spreads on TSLA 5 times in the past 2 weeks I am dead inside
Maybe try it again
I just did 5 minutes ago
Gotta hold AAPL overnight at this point, looks too good
FUCK THE BEARS AHHHH
I now have no idea what could bring this market down
Vix took a huge dump
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Whose ready for the gap down tomorrow
How do we feel about Spy 480c for jan 2022?
500c
I'm doing Feb 480c but I'm waiting for a small correction to complete my position.
I want to also but at this rate im not sure well have one. Ive waited a week for a pullback and should have just bought last week.
I’d say pretty darn good! Might even shoot for 500c’s
God I love days like this, sit at home and shit post while getting paid from work and getting paid from calls. Tis the good life, can't wait to retire in my 30s
Jpowell peg me!! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
will my amzn puts going to devastate my portofolio?
Seriously questioning my decision making abilities in life. I've literally been wrong about every single trade that I've made the last two weeks... I'm dumbfounded and nearly wiped out.
Go long oil. You missed uranium. But watch it and wait for a nice pullback then go long uranium. You’re welcome
there's an old saying in Tennessee, i know its in Texas, probably in Tennessee
I get fooled every fucking time
Fool me once, shame on... Shame on you

...

If you fool me you can't fool me again
Fool me once uhhh shame on….shame on me?
Fool, me, fool me jpow can’t get fooled again
Upvotes for everyone. Even the retards
Upvote if you’re poor
This is probably the only place I'll admit it: I'm poor.

I make $220 monthly car loan payments. I *could* pay off car loan in full with gains from meme stocks, but I won't. I will take the risk because I want to *not* be poor. And if I am wrong, then, we'll, I'll just keep making monthly car loan payments and that.
GME will fly today, look at the volume, it's crazy low.
its more volume in 3 hours that in some days in all premarket.
pumping
#BB we like the stock. 🅱️🅱️🍇🚀
[deleted]
Say what
After all, why not? Why shouldn’t I buy into GME fomo at open?
Cause everyone should be buying shares instead first
Every Meme Stock on Earth can now be found on the Moon.
Few percent AH move is the moon now?
For the bagholders it is.
Where my ocgn family at
Here
Here
Lets gooo
NAAN BREAD FOR THE WHOLE OCGN FAMILY
More like bread line 😳
Tesla 1200+ today daddy Powell pumps the market
Shorters are so arrogant.  Really? Shorting Ocgn to 15 at open? Who the fuck sells on this news? 😂 

I hope this takes out a hedgefund for good career wise
Market not gonna give a fuck about the fed meeting I feel it
for PFE or what?
Spy hitting $455 after JPOW ends our bull run later today 🔥🔥 puts on deck 🌈🐻
I'm kinda fucked if this doesn't happen. I'm jacked 2 the tits with puts, but that's nothing new.
Inverse this idiot
Puts on my starbucks barista. Bitch made me a coffee with literally 40% cream... the fuck is this supposed to be a grande milkshake?
Your fault for not drinking your coffee black.
Black coffee in the AM, but black coffee twice a day ends up giving me heart burn by the end of the week. Getting older is a bitch.
You did go to a Starbucks.
My practice is in the middle of a lower middle class neighborhood, the other options in quick driving distance are 1 of 8 gas stations or a casino.
She lives a happier life than you.
Her toilet lives a sadder life than mine
That’s the worst thing about the pandemic. Having to order your milk of choice from the counter. How haven’t they standardized splash, light, etc.  I get the same drink almost every day.  Some days it’s way to much cream some days not enough.   You figure they could manage that right?  One of three days it is right.
I don't know how else to ask for a tiny bit of cream other than like...2 tbsps? Like fuck lady why would I ask for a small splash of cream if what I wanted was 200 mL of it
Everything is at ATHs and the FEDs are about to announce that the game is over and some people are talking about buying calls, interesting...
Honestly, can you blame anyone? Apple misses, pulls guidance, and the dip is bought up at opening the next day. Hertz declares bankruptcy, its stock doubles. Tesla sells .75% of all cars in US? Better make it worth everyone combined.
I have a nasty feeling this is a bulltrap for Tommorow I’m smelling a bloody Thursday 

Too euphoric
> You're a loser.

#REAL INFLATION IS 15%, feels like 30%, paid $4.50 for a bottle of water at the airport, drinking fountains were covered with plastic.
airport water was $4.50 like 3 years ago, and non shit airports have those water dispensers that you could your bottle under.
$4.50 for airport water is a fucking steal my guy, I’ve seen them upwards of $10
Lol airports are always expensive
Airport inflation has always been 300%
Lol Airport food and drink is always expensive af. Guaranteed $15 for a shitty sandwich and water from Starbucks
Yeah every airport has been doing this lately wtf
I don’t care about your personal problems.
I haven't noticed. Drinks are free at the business lounge
Airport prices are high!? Weimar all over again. Proud boys was a sign of hyperinflation.
Tesla stock split confirmed?!
RIOT for another $4 today...and another $20 the next 30 days. shorts are fucked!
*Unzips pants. Please keep going. I’m almost there 📈🚀🚨❤️🦍
Cathies gonna double down on Z at open I’ll bet any amount of money
And she’ll have to keep adding for awhile!!
nah buddy as bearish as u are the floor is at $66, good buy there maybe
How much calls or shares you holding?
thinking of buying some at 66, so far none
Zillow gonna be in 20s by Friday

🤡😂🤡
Which should I buy in OCGN or BBBY
Ocgn
If you hate money buy both.
Good dip yesterday to buy more TSLA
OCGN shorts hitting back hard
Ocgn got raped I guess
OCGN was a classic case of buy the hype and sell the hype
More hype please 😁
TSLA 1200+ today ??
Ocugen Sold the news
GME 35*0 eow*

*"Buy the ticket, take the ride"* 🚀- Hunter S. Thompson

10:30 rug pull standing by.
TSLA $1250 end of Tomorrow!
Lol
I need it sooner chief
SPY needs to quit fuckin around and chit the bed already.
It will eventually, probably February.
Elon should have shut tf up, the stock does better when he doesn’t say dumb shit
Bro it ran up 50% over last 3 months lol
That boy always talkin
Did he says his company's valuation makes no sense again?  He's probably right in all reality.
Down goes AMC and GME lol IWM will be next
So how does Biden admin play this?
Their popularity is in the shitter....
Elections looking bad... People complaining about the economy... Take away the free money and it gets worse..

Tough
They just do what I do. Take a nap and hope for the best by the time you wake up
I don't necessarily agree. After the last 18 months people are starting to understand that their free doll against the rich $23 and just put some further behind.
>I don't necessarily agree. After the last 18 months people are starting to understand that their free doll against the rich $23 and just put some further behind.

The fuck was this?  Do you even English?
Lame 🦆
I’d say Cathie is a MILF but she already getting fucked by the old men that work in big hedge funds. Safe to say they fuck her in a gangbang scenario so she really isn’t a mother id like to fuck anymore
Her pussy only get wet for God bro
She belongs on LegalPorno
Bonus: she's old enough to get full SS benefits as a GILF.
Where’s the OCGN gang?  Pulling your head out of your butt?  Lol
Neck into rope
No taper $470 eod?
Your enthusiasm is both intoxicating and infuriating, cheers 🍻
TBD
Yeah, all you GME bagholders were talking that good shit a moment ago. Now look what happened.  
  
**Y'ALL GOT KICKED IN YO CHEST**
Tapering is priced in ya nerds. If everyone thinks it's going to crash the market, disappointing news seems good if it's not worse case scenario. That's how this market works.
Everything just randomly spikes and then plummets. Manipulation?
FOMC dumbass
It’s algos trying to work out wtf is going on
Fuck yo puts

-jpow
SPY RED AGAIN

Update: SPY GREEN NOW
VIX is down, SPY is up. We continue to run. It's priced in, like the few of us have been saying. Doesn't matter if there are negative implications. If the implications have been doomed and gloomed for an entire month, turns out it isn't that bad, we go up.
If CNBC is covering it, it's the expectation.
VIX is impacted by derivatives. No one is actually buying underlying assets - just look at the volume today.
POWELL FOR A SECOND TERM
AGAIN I SAY AGAIN, Imagine being a TSLA bear lol
I swear to god if the market drops tomorrow because it was a “late reaction” to what Jpow said I’d be pissed
Almost guaranteed
honestly im getting mentally ready for it cuz im seeing so much green today i dont want to get spoiled by it
I know how WallST works I bet you they’ll play that move tomorrow-next week following. “We’ve finally fully digested everything said”
I cut my rather large losses and sold what was lwft
F
Printer stays on
Sold my hedge calls to avoid margin call, now need a deep dip sometime this week to avoid losing a couple thousand fun coupons lol.  Life of a 🌈🐻
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
If this is what tapering feels like then TAPER ME UP BABY
Come on $SPY! You know you want to gang bang some more green dildos.
INTC , SNAP & BABA 🚀🚀
Damn you bulls gotta leave some crumbs for us to eat
If you have to preface your shitty bearish opinions with

Rip ocgn.

2 Nov - 3 Nov
#i dont even recognize this sub anymore
Probably stabilizes by next week where meme shills are back to the posting equivalent of that one guy yelling on the street corner
Preaching about the apocalypse at your local student center. Fucking gems
Me neither. Probably gonna leave.
you'll be back. don't lie.
Maybe when things get exciting again or when it’s funny here
Where to tho
Idk. The gym or the bar maybe lol.
It got too much attention with the GME play.
i hate to say it but this JPOW guy seems kind of privileged.

&#x200B;

i think he should work at wendy's to get a feel for inflation.

&#x200B;

guarantee it would be a better metric than whatever the fuck the fed is using.
just in case it hasn't been said, man I admire Jpow's professionalism and sincerity up there. the man is focused on his job responsibilities, and takes the job seriously. 

he may get a 2nd term
Daddy Jpow 🥰🥰
Is TSLA gonna go up tomorrow??
#GOD HATES BEARS

OCGN holders learning what sell the news means
A new generation of bagholders will be born.

Glad i didn't fomo for once yesterday,  almost got calls
I drop kicked my OCGN leaps the last time it bounced to like $10 so i could close at even.

Missed out 😂

Buy more SPY 530C 1/21/2022

You’re welcome, see you at lambo dealer/table at the club 12/31. Dom P on me.

Can’t wait
If this works, I'm tracking you down and consensually kissing you on the mouth.
I barely slept dreaming about meme stocks
Zillow in the shadow realm
They made a big oopsie
Yeah they’re idiots. Housing company without a pulse on housing market. The overlooked part of this is they have to cull 25% of workforce. No chance at reversing any time soon
Exactly. How bad do you have to be at reading your own market to fuck up so bad that you have to can a quarter of your workforce to survive? This thing isn’t coming back for a while.
Literally decided as a business to buy as many homes as possible in one of the largest supply constraint years in history (causing massively inflated prices) and sold them for a loss 💀💀💀
They tried to play it off like the MTM on balance sheet had too much vol. Which isn’t false. But no chance institionals will want to own a cyclical industry stock at peak selling assets at a loss and laying off its workforce. It’s prone to tax loss selling too. This is DEAD $$$. Selling calls
Rip ATVI

Waiting for this to bottom out and may buy the dip a little

Z gonna pull a chegg
Do y’all think RKT puts are a good idea considering how poorly Zillow did?
No, Zillow made a stupid move that has nothing to do with RKT's business model. RKT just made a deal with Salesforce that is more relevant.
🤔 ok,I just feel like the whole market is way over inflated
Maybe so, but Zillow's foolishness is limited to them and maybe a few of their competitors doing the same thing.
oof that sell off
Is it weird to feel hope on taper day?

Another lesson in do not short TSLA
Do not listen to its overbought siren song.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVxJ016xb4Q
wow not GME flying after i sold half yesterday looooooooooool
Give those shorts some vaseline, GME pegging them hard again ...
Only gonna say it one more time for the lucky guy reading. $TELL is set to take off in the next week or two, get in before it doubles $$$$
4000 shares in 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Nice! only 3,200 here
Natural gas company. It's $0.60 from it's highest point. Are you basing these claims because oil is going through the roof?
What’s the reason for doubling?

Feel bad? I yolo’d 85% of my portfolio into EOW Russell 2000 puts yesterday. 

Today I learned you never go full retard.
You gotta diversify the retardedness. It’s no fun losing everything in one place
They won’t allow a taper tantrum to happen. They’ve been through that before. They’ll push it out suitably far enough that any decline cannot be laid on the Fed’s shoulders.
Nothing but bad trades all October brought me negative in my account.

Monday I say, “tomorrow, Zillow puts might be a move, I shall deposit some money to make this move” and my stupid fucking funds still haven’t gone through. It would have been the best trade I’ve made, and I’m watching it slip through my hands every day, waiting.
Both the brokerages i use give me the money within 5 minutes how have you not gotten funds
I just opened Schwab, so I don’t know about them.

But Webull won’t allow my funds instant access to options, just stock buying. It takes like a week to get options access??

RH I went negative and now they won’t let me play with my money till it “clears the deficit”
Ah, i see. Yeah i use RH and TD and both still give me money

I just got instant deposit back on RH tho so i feel your pain
Even RH instant deposit is better
Thoughts on playing all birds on ipo?  If it’s so popular Robinhood won’t issue shares than might be a crazy opening like coin or hood?
I have their shoes, I love them
I heard they are akin to crocs on cheap and easy to produce so the valuation should go super high in the long run.
When can we buy shares of Allbirds?
I dunno trying to google but I think these usually open between 11a est - 1p est.  usually earlier on.

I listened to the votes and FOMO’ed in BB calls at open, after taking a stark loss out of the gate, I was able to just now dump them for a 3% gain.   I’m sure it will rocket from here but I feel relieved to escape a meme stock with any profit
What’s the bull thesis for OCGN? The Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines have majority market share. Developed nations also provide these vaccines to poor countries at cost or for free. What am I missing?
Thesis: there are many bags but these bags are mine. Please somebody take them
Nothing it’s a bag oh shit.
I just bought puts for next week. This thing always falls on its face.
#freee
Developed nations be purchasing the vaccine from its maker, who presumably pays OCGN a pittance of a licensing fee.  Pretty sure they haven't the factories to produce it at scale
Which bag to average down on today.......GME, OCGN, BBBY.  FOMO at its best today for me.
Was hoping OCGN wasn’t a PnD. In at 8.12$ so I’m not worried but we’ll see.

Ouch
And it just keeps going up.. how rude
I bought some spy puts yesterday but I just can’t deal with the market going up when it should go down when they announce taper so I just got back out. So those holding puts now have a chance.
Dont worry I am still holding, Im fucked I know it. Can pull the plug. Im scared. Daddy JPOW is going to wreck my puts, I can feel it.
I was hoping it would fall today BEFORE 2:00
Swung $Z 70P overnight for the smallest gains at the open. Left over 5k on the table :(

TEVA sub $10 is free money.  mark my words.
Explain. It's been hovering around 10 for 6 months. Curious.
hovering so low for so long due to two things (IMO): debt associated with Actavis acquisition and the overhang of opioid litigation.  First item has been slashed by basically half since TEVA absolutely prints free cash.  The second item got a huge catalyst from a ruling in CA yesterday.  The rest of the states are about to fall like dominoes, and TEVA will bounce back to a reasonable p/e
Interesting to see a dip after that ruling. Just read about it. Will watch
we were up 10% after the ruling...

Tapering is already priced in. We’ve known about it for over a month. The fed will probably provide guidance to their plans to change interest rates over the next few years, so that’s what the market is looking to hearing about mainly.

I want to buy the recent tech dips, but at the same time, I want NASDAQ to crash first. Guess I'll wait
PYPL?
yea that's definitely one. PYPL,  SNAP, maybe ATVI today
I have really fucked myself with AMZN options
Selling AMZN options was the way to go this year. It’s been trading between 3000 and 3500 forever
Thanks Captain Hindsight
Amd is on a tear right now and I’m happy but I wish it did this last week xD. Do I sell my 1305c and try to jump ship to gme or spy instead?

That just dropped today
Zoinks!
It was around 44 before it shot up yesterday so I'm waiting for it to go back personally
It’s a fraud
Not buying shit until halfway through JPOW speech.
You think spy will keep dipping as long as he talks?
Closed my PYPL yolo earlier for a loss that MF still tanking
What’s the reason?
It broke the support I was watching at 227.25
What’s it’s next support line? You think it could make a sharp rebound?  Calls would be good if there is a chance of that.
There’s some support lines around 225 and 222.29 then it drops to the 14 day RSI around 201
It’s just hard to tell, it definitely deserves an up move but the CEO sold some stock on October 28th so the stock is still in a volatile time
What’s the reason for selling? Do you know? Could be bad times ahead.
What’s the reason for the CEO selling? Do you know? Could be bad times ahead.
I’m actually not sure, he only sold a fraction of his shares of course but it can still be seen as a bad sign for investors, it’s definitely getting close to a great entry though and going long at this point would be a good grab
Thanks. I’ll keep my eye on it.
Bubble is popping
Be greedy and never sell just like every other time playbois
Just buy shares and hold forever.

Everytime I decide to sell call options on AMD I get giga-fucked 🤷

Edit: make that $278

Zillow didn’t fail to predict the trajectory of home prices, they failed to adjust for inflation when calculating renovation and labor costs. Redfin has the exact same problem, just on a smaller scale.
They used their useless zestimate to make cash offers in phoenix.

A few years back (like 5-6) Young dumb Me bought some AMD shares at like 2.50. I then sold a whole bunch at like $8 because I wanted an iPhone. El oh el

Taysom Hill but im a saints fan so obvious bias
nah i feel it. hope he doesn't fuck up my kamara though sean payton loves getting cute with hill's bitch ass
Nah we're gunna lean on Kamara HARD this week. Half the reason we got Ingram back was so Kamara could stop taking such a beating between the tackles so it frees him up more in the passing game. He'll be our WR1 and with a backup QB seans gunna call a fuck ton of screens imo

Plus its Falcons week and Hill and Kamara both fuck the dirty birds
Alright well this is about the time where I close my portfolio app and act like it doesn’t exist

Quick question. Can one exercise call options after hours? Like my bbby being up a fuck ton yesterday evening, could i have exercised them, then sold stock at $30 during ah, instead of waiting til the morning dump?
> Yes, you can exercise call options after hours. You would have to sell the stock immediately upon exercising it though because there is no way to hold a position in an option over night and still be able to trade with it at 8:30am EST when the market opens.

I’ve got one for a free frosty. I’ll give it to you behind the dumpster.
When my spy calls print I’m gonna let my money settle and buy a new prebuilt. It’s the easiest way to get components and the only thing I might change is the CPU.
I love watching BB shoot up, selling a weekly covered call, then watching it dip knowing I’ll get my cake and get to eat it too.
One low volume 15 min candle so the MMs can keep closing their positions 20 dollars higher.  …..
Stupid fukin Sofi. Hopefully get out at $25

11/5 45P FSLY.
There’s no way this doesn’t print right?
Already down 6% whoops
PATH giving me a nice rise
$SAVA is looking fucking awful wow. Made money shorting camber, DATs, NXTP, might as well short this garbage as well. CTB is only 2% as well. The beauty of shorting fraud is that, so long as you properly manage margin, against a possible run (usually I leave 50% cushion). You WILL eventually make money.
Does anyone else think $SKLZ is a shitty stock (positions: 100 11/5 11p

AXSM power higher by $1.50 today after consolidating a massive $25% move up two weeks ago.  


Every day that goes by is another day closer to AXS 05, the crown jewel, blockbuster depression treatment getting passed by the FDA. Then in April, the smaller, $300 million a yearly rev. drug AXS 07 will go before the FDA for approval.  


Later in 2022, AXSM will apply for approval of a third drug.  


Anyone not in AXSM by now the window is still open on this expected $150 stock that is currently trading at just over $40.

Had spy puts and decided to load up on spy 0dte calls, thank fucking god I did lmao

Keep Daddy Powell angry, market goes up when he's irritated.
I was doing so well in selling safe BB puts and PLTR creddies that I decided to drop some cash on AMD willy wonkas. 130C 11/5, because Barchart says that's the highest option traded today by volume. Also tens of thousands of weekly calls at a few different strikes, but <10k in the most popular weekly put. Apparently there's something about a merger but I don't research too deeply into my lotto plays.
Where’s all the fucking bears? Fucking cucks

JPow really emits that alpha quality. Imminent rotation from milfs to dilfs.
If Biden gets rid of JPOW, that makes him a 🐻.
Anyone buying zillow here?
I bought a ton shares at $64
I think that's the right move, getting nervous doing the same though
2.8k shares at $64 average. I figured if CW was buying, I should too. It's 70% down from ATH
CW?
Bye my hedges.  Thought I did well waiting until yesterday to rebuy after a month of green, lol.

Kinda worried, where do we go from this? Are we gonna keep partying on Green Day’s?


Wait, ITS ALMOST DECEMBER, Santa rally came early
It's November it came on time🚀
Why should I **not** buy these ROOT 11/19 7.5c based on the unusual open interest and high short interest? Why will I lose money on this? Sincerely asking. Talk me out of it.
I'm actually surprised that Zillow didn't have any volatility trading halts today. With the size of tranches getting sold, I'm wondering if institutions are trying to get out quickly but not so fast that they get blocked
holy fuck that's a huge volume sell
They'll get bailed out...
I mean its Zillow with a sub $20 Billion market cap, I don't think there's any bail outs coming for something that small
Get in before the fomo
How to Do that ?

3x margin on ROKU shares
I have been telling people to buy shares of $OCGN all fucking week. Just check my comments on my profile. Its fucking funny now that $OCGN is blowing up they want to buy now. You should have bought earlier. Makes me sad about all the profits my fellow retards have missed out on. I have almost doubled my money. I wish it was the same for all of you!
Bag holders will be made today, godspeed
It’s definitely not too late, approval and other catalysts will send this fucker $20+
Lmk the next stock then :) I’ve lost enough to be cautious about trusting the people here tbh
I bought it last week, someone in here was talking it up, not sure if it was you, if so, thanks bud.
It probably was lmao. I have been here spamming people about $OCGN
yesterday lost money on ocgn. my leveragep position got caugh t in stop los hunt. ..... anyway, i am back in.

Just let her be happy lmao
She’s in the green lol, I mean if she’s fine with shares have her buy a few from all over and then set and forget
how much are you up % wise from the beginning of the year? cuz she has an amazing return.
Maybe you need a boyfriend.
She's probably made more than most of us to tbh
20 years from now you will still be in the red and she will have an actual retirement account
+$280 is probably more than a lot have made here haha
Did she spend 40hrs a week on this? If not, she's right, she's up
Holy GuacoMolE
SPY doesn’t even sell a single product. Goes to show this a inward looking market
That’s why we buy TSLA

Thoughts on TSLA crossing 1200 today?
Hopeful. But seems unlikely.
Another theta day
Isn’t this fed meeting taper shit nonsense already priced in? Why would shit tank today? 

$SPY ATH EOD👌🏽
Spy up 7% in the last month. That's a 84% YoY pace. Pretty sure nothing is correctly priced in lol.
The drop is way too obvious, everyone might as well load up on puts. Shit ain’t ‘bout to drop.
Yea flat is also an option.
Flat deez nuts. 

I get what you’re saying though and maybe you’re right, tbh.
rip to those who keep missing the $TSLA dips ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) Bought some $1100 dec calls on nearly today's low ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)

Costanza Principle this bitch to get rich.
She bought 
Hood too.
Yea but HOOD is up 6% today. She addicted to the HOOD.
Lmao how does she do it so consistently
You get on this impossibly long winning streak with a small amount of money, then when you're convinced you're onto something and up the ante, an even more impossibly long losing streak starts. That's how I do it, anyway.
Yeah same dumb question I guess lol
Her excuse is and will be a 5yr time horizon
Has she ever said 5 years from when?
Fuck me.
She is consistent in her methods that’s for certain
Imagine thinking this rally is over.... SPY 500 by January
spy 500 eow???
Fed announcement didn't crash anything so I'm levering up more on NVDA and TSLA.
you should really wait until Jerome speaks, market is digesting right now
I am going 60% cash. The worst case scenario is I have to buy back in and lose a little bit.
Facing massive inflation and WSB is like, 'good time to go cash'. Never change, WSB, never change
It’s for a day you retard
SPY at ATHs and WSB is like, 'good time to go cash'. Never change, WSB, never change
Also known as taking profits
Not a fan
Jpow gonna slap 10 inches of limp dick on the podium and say Bull R Fuk!
How fast would this shit fall if Jerome pulled a Rick and Morty and just shot himself live after saying "it's all gonna crash we're fuckkeedd!!" Good thing he won't and it only goes up!
With this market, he could get up there and say there’s 2,500 Russian warheads in the air and the S&P would go up 10% before the circuit breaker on human life gets flipped
hahahahahah bears fucked
Thank you u/axemanfromMa 

A prophet among us
Fucking told these retards
Tsla 1500 call 11/19 print??
Oh yes!!
So many whiny bears in this fed meeting. nobody cares that your $6 burger is now $9. Meanwhile they freak out if anybody raises the slave wages or if the gov gives people $300 they claim nobody works for a year. They just low goods prices with high real estate prices. Fuck em JPOW
SPY $35 away from $500 and Infa bill about to drop too.

$500 by 12/1/2021, you heard it first here
As insane as it is, I’m starting to think Tesla might hit 1300 in the next week or two.
Or Friday wtf lmaoooooo
[deleted]
Rip it in 2
Tsla put
Probably a call of some sort
lotto-WKHS. Earnings/catalyst: So Fi
Sklz puts maybe
Wait for tomorrow's dip and buy spy debit spreads in the 50/50 range for 11/5. Then amen or ramen
MRO earnings play. Can even buy cheap long calls in January for 1.40 right now. 17 strike
TSLA 1200c’s printing
They will be worth exactly $5 on Friday close
will spy hit 465 by nov 10?
By tomorrow
Why is everyone not spamming OTM spy calls…this is the freest money right in front of you

There’s no way I can make more on Tesla, it has to drop
Nooo i picked 2 more like 20 minutes ago.
AMZN is mooning 🚀
Should have bought more than 1 call. I freaking knew it.
So this is what Santa Claus Rally means
Just you wait baby

What's the after market close earnings play with expected large moves today guys? Need to gamble in the next 30 minutes before close.

Maybe, but it's no surprise whatsoever that a stock goes down on good news.
Well it's up now lol
Well it's up now lol
But it's up 100% on the month, so everyone already bought the rumour right?
Right, but 100% for pharma stocks is nothing also it looked like a healthy climb

Lol definitely not. I only used a portion of the profit from my last square calls to buy these. Let me know when those shares go up 300% in a week.
AFRM the best of them all in that space IMO
Is $BB being a meme stock still a thing? Waiting for it to recover
BB is a meme/fundamental hybrid. Could moon off meme hype AND/OR the slew of fundamental catalysts coming in the near term.
What are the slew of catalysts?
Is there a real estate bubble popping?
yeah, but the rub is ya gotta move to china.
Yeah COVID was just supposed to be a China problem too.  What’s their deal!?!?
GME hits the daily pivot for the second time this morning and forms a big ass green candle. I have no idea why this retarded stock keeps going up but I'm running out of reasons to say that it won't hit 230 or at least 225 today.

I can’t picture Jerome saying anything good about interest rates. Inflation going crazy because Demand is extremely high. And with the new wage data + continued low interest rates demand will continue growing. Meanwhile the supply chain is F’ed and can’t catch up.

I mean there's a way to do it that doesn't suck, but I jumped in head first and made a bunch of dumb mistakes. Be picky about who you rent to. Make sure you have enough credit or capital to afford repairs immediately. Start the eviction process as soon as you think you might need to, because it takes months.

chances of the Fed increasing rates? I got "no chance." What do you guys think?
They will not raise rates with the current global supply chain issues.  They may signal that they intend to at a future date though which would have the same effect (big red).
“We are raising the fed funds rate to 2.5% and will start purchasing equities of automotive companies, ahem, I mean tech companies with the highest of P/E ratios.”
Not until next Summer is my best guess

TSLA could buy Hertz 20 times over, with all the market cap they gained from this hyped-up deal.

US Economics Analyst: From Tapering to Rate Hikes (Mericle/Hatzius)

29 October 2021 | 8:46PM EDT

■
We are pulling forward our forecast for the Fed’s first rate hike by one full year to July 2022, shortly after tapering is scheduled to conclude. We expect a second hike in November 2022 and two hikes per year after that. However, the range of possible outcomes is wide, especially in the longer term.
■
The FOMC will announce the start of tapering next week, presumably at the $15bn per month pace noted in the September minutes. If implementation begins in mid-November, the last taper would come in June 2022. Large surprises on the virus, inflation, wage growth, or inflation expectations could prompt a revision, but we think the hurdle for a change in either direction is high.
■
The main reason for the change in our liftoff call is that we now expect core PCE inflation to remain above 3%—and core CPI inflation above 4%—when the taper concludes. Sequential core inflation should be lower at that point but still around 2%, with shelter running hot. Taken together, we think this will make a seamless move from tapering to rate hikes the path of least resistance.
■
The biggest complication is the guidance in the FOMC statement that even the first rate hike requires maximum employment. However, with inflation far above target, unemployment likely below the median participant’s 4% NAIRU estimate, and job availability high, we think the committee will conclude that most if not all of the remaining weakness in labor force participation is structural or voluntary.
■
We maintain our view that growth will slow to a trend-like pace and inflation will drop to the low 2s by late 2022 or early 2023, without an aggressive monetary policy response. The key reasons are that the level of fiscal support will continue to decline sharply and supply chain problems should be resolved, turning the inflationary surge in the goods sector into a temporary deflationary drag.
■
As a result, we see the possible paths ahead as bimodal: if something delays liftoff long enough for growth and inflation to fall sharply by end-2022, the Fed could stay on hold for a while. This was the scenario we previously envisioned.
■
Beyond 2022, we forecast one hike every six months. We see this pace as plausible either as a dovish response if inflation remains modestly above 2% or as an average outcome if inflation fluctuates above and below 2%.
Kick that can down the road baby
Good post
Whole market fucked 100% confirmed with this movement , wait til it goes down
Bye
Bed Bath and Beyond up more than 50%, Tesla valued near Apple yet apple makes 27x more money than Tesla, Trump stocks rocketing to Uranus. This shit is a fucking bubble. I'm calling the top.
So definitely not the top then.
It is the top, but tomorrow we have a new higher top
Haven’t heard that before lol. I do think we are getting close though. Might be 3rd year of Brandon’s term at the latest. Gotta pay the piper sometime
Bye GME bye AMC

Only if elon musk had little brain and that retarded fuck havent put that screenshot. We would have been st 1450 per share on tesla.

Some of you all in twitter stop talking to him, dont fucking drag him to tesla shares
Imagine arguing with a CEO about his company's valuation
There is a reason SEC sued him last year fir manipulation
They are probably the reason he had to calm the speculation this time and admit that the Hertz deal was not material enough to move the stock price like that.
Nah. He just cant take the fact hertz moved the stock more than earnings number did
What screenshot?
There was tesla retard in twitter posted 1213 reached screenshot of tesla share on that psychos twitter. It fucking triggered him
Doubt he reads all his twit reply. It was probably us that threw him off lol

If there’s a market wide 60% crash the new currency is ammo
Already kind of is.
Naah. Maybe if it was 96%.
My puts would like that very much, so it won't happen
Just mid morning dip people. Hold hold hold. Let the volume build. AMC to the moon
As soon as everybody says "Get it, here we go, to the moon. It's rocketing." -- I get in and then the rocket crashes into the ocean. Every F-in Time.
I think its a sign that you don't get into the rocket ship when people invite you
call me when you sell. thx.
We’ll stop getting in then. You’re ruining for everyone. Jerk
Sorry. Next time everybody says get in. I will stand and wave, so you guys can land on the moon.
Maybe stop doing that then

Cold like Minnesota!
Analysts who covered Zillow should be investigated for fraud. I read their annual report last year and they were losing 50k+ per home sold. The goal off flipping a house is to make money.  You can’t do it sitting behind a computer using an algorithm. Every single home is different and must be analyzed independently.  Analysts threw around the word “scale”, like a bunch of idiots. If you a do a dumb thing, doing a lot more of it just makes it even worse.
Jpow dump is gonna begin!
GME coming back for it lets go
If you didn’t sell the morning rip I have no idea what you expect to happen.

Like literally? Let me seeee
Lol you need to start DVR'ing cnbc
DVR what is it 2008
PINS, PTON, and NET all report earnings after hours on Thursday. Calls on any of them, or all puts?
I have puts on NET but I'm usually wrong so do what you will with that one
As much as I would like to short PINS, those companies have a lot of retarded strength so I’m not touching it
Pton...  on delta flights
PTON calls? They were my most sure put. What do you mean delta flights?
we dipping at open. too obvious.
Woke up, checked premarket movers, theyre all boring shite i dont want money on

Oh well, bring on the earnings reports

Is this unironically a buying opportunity?

That's what I thought when it was at $100
Oof
I'd buy CHGG before Zillow.  It's at a 52-week low
I don't like CHGG's business. Zillow can just cut the speculative crap and focus on the software to grow business.

It's bound to go up with all the positive news on the way, i get the feeling hedges are artificially keeping it down and trying to buy all the calls for themselves when people sell from small drops. If you hold and it goes to 30 or 40 youll be super happy, maybe set a stop loss

I should have bought those 130s monday instead of messing with spy😔 im too poor to play lol

The new ethics rules the Federal Reserve came up with *are not in place yet*. They could literally sell everything they have before pulling the rug, and it would be totally legal.
But that would harm their wealthy buddies too much. No way they'd do that. Better to socialize any losses as much as possible.

Why can’t it be both? :)

I bought right before the earnings call.
Oh wow. Look. FOMC didnt do jack shit to the market. Knew that shit wasnt gonna tank anything at all. It’s already known what they were gonna do. They just needed to hear it and signaled the bulls it’s ok to buy for the rest of the year.

Tapering is an official full go as of 18 minutes ago.
So where is this dump? Im cash heavy
My TSLA puts would like to know where the dump is as well, but this news was expected so a sudden dip probably was never going to happen.
My portfolio sure is tapering downward

People keep saying this but it's not going anywhere. It's going to hold $50-$70 until merger. At minimum it's a lucrative day/swing trade.
Utterly kicking myself for not buying more contracts on Zillow yesterday. 

Bought 1 contract expiring Nov 5th on Nov 1st at 2pm EST after reading that initial house dumping report. 

Bought @ $88, sold @ $2100 a couple minutes ago.

It’s not huge, but I feel like I understand all this stuff now.
1)  that is huge.  
2) if you feel like you understand all this stuff now, goodluck, you're headed back to $88.  And I salute you for it.

Why do libs ask our lord and savior retarded questions he has no power over?

There’s nowhere else for the money to go. Withdraw it? Inflation will eat away at anything you don’t spend immediately. Property? More overpriced than the stock market. Open a business? That’s effort and also takes time away from shitposting on Reddit. There’s only stonks left, money will continue to pour in until the housing market collapses again (which may not even happen).

SPY holding above resistance for sis amount of time. Drill team 6 awaiting orders
DEPLOY DAMNIT!
It seems bizarre for people to still be selling Z after Z has dropped nearly 40% since the start of Monday - all for correcting a mistake that they made. I'd be more worried about them if they doubled down on that flawed model.
this market is super sentimental. a huge percentage of the buyers have no idea what they're buying, they're just following momentum. they see it go up, they buy, they see it go down, they sell.
This. Imagine what happens if we ever get a decent correction ..
Yeah momentum is going down. My cost basis is 97 so tbh thinking about averaging down. They have profitable businesses in IMT and premier agents with expanding margins
Not gonna try to time the bottom but I’m with you, plan on buying leaps as soon as the dust settles
Second run for GME tomorrow or is it done?
guaranteed run on the 24th
I think it needs some news to really run
What did JPOW say?
He said buy calls ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
“Money goes yes”
"brrrrrrrrr !" (while making a cranking motion)
He stood up. And said everything is fine as it is let’s keep printing.   Maybe reassess middle of next year. 

Done in 10 minutes . Being serious he’s  the best person ever
did robinhood start raising margin on unrealized gains? cuz i keep waking up to more margin available even though i havent closed my position
I think they quietly changed margin requirements on meme stocks. I just got a lot more margin too.
Margin is based on cash and equity holdings. Your long stocks go up, so does margin. If it's going up based on SPY FDs, well then get puts on HOOD lol
it hasnt happened before. I always have to close my position to make it a realized gain in order to get the margin match. youre saying it should reset every day? i guess thats why my cash goes up too, cuz the margin is replacing some of my own invested cash
I don't know the resetting time frame, probably depends on broker. But yah your long equities are collateral for your margin loan. How much collateral it is is based on hold time and volatility of the ticker. But Robinhood doesn't always play by the same rules as other brokers, so you may have to call to get an explanation.
they got back to me and said it resets overnight. it only started happening this week. the only thing i can think of is that i havent been selling CCs lately. maybe the CCs were tying up the shares and preventing the margin bump. idk
"yeah uhhh Papa Powell, what would you say to the gey bers u fukt just now?"

The fed is announcing a taper. It will crash lmao
Haha!
Buls, any last words?
Get Fuk ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5958)
No u
You only show up on red days.
This isn’t even remotely true. Take that bullshit elsewhere. I’m here everyday
Busted ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Pants down one more time bears
So guys, I’m thinking OCGN is not the move haha
It was the move 2 weeks ago, approval was being spammed. You don’t buy the news
Ok why is that?
Don't you dumbfucks understand they aren't tapering until next president is elected? Dems gonna let poor people burn as they should
We thinking a selloff before close?
There's definitely people in here that think this sub unironically supports Donald Trump 😂 like we aren't just memeing his dumbass
There are definitely 🥭 fans in here
[deleted]
Right.  They can only sell to US and Canada.  Today's news means nothing for OCGN.
Downvote me all you want, but seriously, get out of the indexes. 

Big money is gonna start deleveraging via dark pools on fed news, and the indexes will get rekt.

This is a PSA. Do what you want with it.
Is this the housing crash I've been waiting for to buy a home?
What crash do you speak of. Can you elaborate
Memeing, I am still going to get shafted buying a house.
Ah, well my advice to you is. Buy when you can. It’s going to take a lot longer for the prices in houses to crash before rates start to tick up again. You’ll be better off taking advantage of the low rates right now before your banking on the housing prices to fall.
Not yet. Give it time and the foreclosures will start and the banks will have lots of property's to get rid of = for cheap.
Lol…you think this is 2008, cute.
When interest rates rise, many will variable rate mortgages will be unable to meet their mortgage payments and when whose properties come onto the market all at once, prices will go down, leaving homeowners under water and they will walk away. The underlying issues will be different from 2008 but the unwinding process will be similar. Real estate has a boom and bust cycle.
I just can’t get myself to jump on the GME bandwagon.
Smartest thing you could do
Sucker bet. I’m selling calls
Fair enough, but you're missing out. People are not able to short like before, now that the amount of shares that are on DRS is super high.
Wow what a hot take
I know that’s the frustrating part. I’m missing out and I’m worried of jumping in too late or too early (I play options)
Good
Same here. Almost bought a few shares the last few weeks when it was down under 200, but just wasn't down quite far enough. Definitely can't now
I don’t believe in the company.
Who cares boomer? I don't believe in like 90% of these companies but I'm damn sure gonna make money off the pumps
Well, there's that too. I haven't bought anything at GameStop for 5 years now probably
but you should, their customer service is really good. Delivery is fast too but depends where u live tho
You ever post some 🔥 and then some 👨‍🚒 deletes it?
go braves

buying ARKK and SPY today

the brainlets over at r/conspiracy are believing pizzagate is real again lol and also i saw someone post there a babylon bee article and refer to it as if it was not satire
I just bounced over there for absolutely no reason. And what dafuq
it is a terrible place but it's like a car wreck i can't look away. i do think it should probably be a banned subreddit but it is nice to see them get dunked on whenever the posts reach r/all
to be fair babylon bee is so terribly unfunny that I wouldn’t really call it satire either.

Yup

SPY looks like it ran out of rocket fuel
Dead cat bounces work when you throw both ways. Too many day traders in today's market. Not enough Powell like chads.
Gme get up! Please
So is VXX the inverse of SPY? I'm confused by its function
no, its volatility. Spy slow bleeds down = vix doesnt care. Spy drops 5% in an hour = vix spikes
This makes sense. Thanks 😊
Basically. There's more to it, but don't overload yourself.

VXX is more like a trailing indicator of fear.

So of SPY drops, VXX goes up and vice versa.

I’m thinking the election results in New Jersey and Virginia may be part of what has been delaying the infrastructure bill. I think with what the results are the 1.5 trillion infrastructure passes soon, and they go back and re-think the “Social Infrastructure” part now.
We will end up with a solid true infrastructure bill with a few social infrastructure tidbits tacked on, which would be great for everyone.

If you’re scared, sell.  But I have faith in JPow. 🙏
wow gme is really gonna go red on the day huh
Sorry I tried to help by selling for a nice profit since that usually makes it rocket shortly after
It’s literally fueled by FOMO. If you hold at this point instead of selling pops you’re a dymbass.

In light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee’s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. Beginning later this month, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $70 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $35 billion per month. Beginning in December, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $60 billion per month and of agency mortgage backed securities by at least $30 billion per month.



So they’re still increasing asset purchases but by a tapered amount??? Can someone read this and make sure I’m not crazy?
They're still performing asset purchases but a decreased amount per month
They said they’d reduce the per month purchase amount. They’re actually reducing the per month purchase increase. 

That’s like reducing acceleration vs. velocity. They’re still speeding up! Inflation is going to continue!
That’s exactly what’s they are doing and said they would do for months
bro it's a tapir like an elephant pig, they aren't castrating the quantitty easing

Load up on Gamestop. My god. Options trading getting suspended, no short sales, after all the calls sold they are gonna be on the hook for like 300% the float at least, i havent checked the numbers for sure, its likely much higher
What you mean options trading getting suspended…
Symbols: GME  
  
Short selling of stock is not allowed at this time.  
There are no additional requirements on long or short options at this time.  
We may implement additional requirements on opening trades on options the day they expire.  
Please keep in mind that additional security and strategy requirements can be added and may change at any time, without notice due to volatility or other market conditions.

How do you keep your motivation? Don't feel like to keep being active after college smh
Ehh, at some point it's not really about motivation, you just kinda have to do it. After college is an important time to stay active man. You're making money, have your own place, probably a relatively stable lifestyle that allows for a good daily routine. Don't slack on how good of a time this is to better yourself. Don't wanna get sloppy (physique wise) as you get older.

 I don't even like lifting weights, just something I gotta keep doing though.

Also for me, I haven't been as consistent this year due to multiple reasons, but in general..guilt gets me to the gym as well. I feel guilty as fuck if I miss multiple sessions
That's exactly my situation lol. Especially I got married shortly after school I don't need to stay in shape to impress girls, so I'm eating the same amount but not active at all and shortly after I started to having a belly and I hated it, starting to workout more last couple months but just lost motivation. You're right I just have to do it for health reason, god speed brother.

All logic says you are right of course, but in 2021 the markets don't operate on logic.
Anyone is in HOOD? Where do you think it will go from here? I see it double next couple of weeks, if not sooner.  Any thoughts?
Why the fuck would it double? Hood is such a pos and pissed off half their users

A lot of the labor shortages could be fixed by allowing more immigration. Will anyone ever figure it out? Probably not.

I just gotta grab a SPY put. No way there’s not a pullback tomorrow or Friday right?
Do what makes you feel safe.

Im a perma bull with a bear suit
Same here fam.
There's a chance we don't have another pullback for 10 years.
We're three weeks without a real red day. Who the fuck knows.
Good luck champ. I’ve been thinking that for the last 2 weeks now & only won 1 of 4 put plays. I’ve given up & now just riding the trend, for better or worse lol.
I thought the same thing last week….. trying to time the top of spy when it’s on a hot streak is a baaaaaad idea mate. The expected tapering announcement came with zero surprises, so this means….. bulls are safe to buy. Nothing to spook the market anymore. We’re closing the year on green months for sure
Just grabbed some 11/24 451 puts. RSI over 72 on SPY. Bond markets went nuts last week around the world. Also, now that everyone isn’t on Fed-watch, just waiting for negative headlines on China’s current COVID outbreak to roll out this weekend and depress the market next week.

Instead of student loan forgiveness they should match 5% of payments made into SPY that you’re able to cash out once it’s paid off. This would pump the markets, incentivize payments and anyone who wouldn’t want that is too dumb to understand the benefits
Yes with the caveat that the usurious interest rates be dealt with so people don’t spend their entire lives paying interest.

Do you guys not realize this is artificial inflation to mask the deflationary period we are in and soon banks will realize that people don’t got any money so they gonna stop lending and shits gonna start defaulting and with the artificial high prices of everything no ones gonna be able to buy shit and everything is gonna get fucked like everyones gonna default on their loans and the Great Depression will be surpassed by the most epic depression

I don't really look at puts because I'm pretty sure they've priced in the fact that it's a scam.

> The first recorded instance of a bird being used as an instrument was in 1747, when a French organist named Jean-Jacques Rousseau attached mechanical wings to his canary. This allowed it to sing much more loudly and with greater range than normal, leading the audience at one performance to believe that he had been assisted by angels.
when the fed said inflation was transitory they were incorrect. partially because they were unclear. when the fed discusses inflation it refers to inflation due to monetary policy. the reason the fed was incorrect by claiming inflation due to monetary policy was transitory is not because such inflation is long lasting, but actually because such inflation is nonexistent
No they were right. It either transitions into higher inflation or lower inflation. I’ll send you my TA
Imagine if the Fed admitted inflation wasn’t transitory. The World would go nuts. The Fed is like a doctor in the ER telling a kid who just got his hand blown off from fireworks that it’s just a slight cut
well tbf it's just that the period of "transitory" is essentially passed. The Fed shouldn't do any panic-signaling because there's nothing to panic about of course. but the thing is there's nothing that the fed can do about it anyways since it's just still pandemic related shit with supply chain issues and with last year's unusually low prices. i personally don't think the inflation is a big problem and i also think the fed should keep doing what they're doing. politicians need to stop stoking fear in their gullible constituents
Nothing to panic about, trying being in the bottom 50 percent of the country. Trying dealing with inflation on a fixed income. You are fucked. The Fed could have done something if they wanted to, they could have tapered early. Stimulating demand when supply chains are fucked makes 0 sense. JPow was just trying to keep his job by keeping the economy roaring, but this was a horrible decision as the economy should have cooled to stop inflation
tapering early would have been so much worse. Unemployment benefits should have continued, especially now with hindsight proving that UI had nothing to do with keeping people away from jobs.

calling powell's actions "a horrible decision" for keeping us out of a certain recession that would have been worse than 2008 is laughable
Please explain how tapering early would have been a bad thing? Unemployment benefits did not need to continue as inflation would have only surged. If you give money to our poorest they spend it ASAP. Producers also raise prices because they know people are getting transfer payments. They didn’t work for it so why should they care about paying more. 

QE stimulates demand. We do not have a demand problem. This is a supply problem. Cut down the excessive demand and let supply chains work themselves out. 

JPow is only concerned with a 2nd term. He could have tapered in the spring of 2021 but he was doing whatever the WH wanted so he could get a 2nd term
demand would stagnate and then it would have been clear that inflation would continue regardless since the factors leading to inflation haven't changed. that's a bad thing imo idk maybe you think differently.

>Unemployment benefits did not need to continue as inflation would have only surged

wrong? producers aren't raising prices because they know people are getting transfer payments. this is called price gouging and during an emergency (such as a global pandemic) this is illegal.

>QE stimulates demand. We do not have a demand problem

thanks to powell and the fed
Your analysis isn’t even close to right. Ending QE would stagnate demand? I don’t think so. 

Price gouging. We live in a free market. It would not be illegal. Take a look at college tuition over the last 40 years. The more we give students access to loans the more colleges raise their prices. 

I can’t tell if this is JPow burner or you actually haven’t a clue about economics and how monetary policy works. Here’s a hint, when you print trillions of dollars producers raise prices to capture those trillions of dollars. Even worse when supply chains are already broken
lol stupid
Can’t tell if you are retarded or just want JPow to blow more bubbles
i mean you're the one who is so off base on all this. price gouging not illegal during an emergency? there's maybe 5 states where this is the case. why refer to college tuition that's irrelevant. i have an economics degree i have at least an above average understanding of economics and monetary policy. economic theory and also real life evidence over the past 13 years has proven that printing trillions of dollars does not necessarily lead to higher prices.

but it's okay the discussion is done i think we've settled on where we're just going to have to agree to disagree. i personally think recession is bad and you think it's good and we won't come to terms there
Not seeing much talk about DNUT but volume has been steadily increasing along with share price over the past week.

Anyone ever have surgery to fix a deviated septum? When am I gonna be able to breath again
Have your doctor recommend you to an ENT specialist. You might get part of it covered by insurance (not the cosmetic portion)
I didn’t, but a friend did. The few days after the surgery were apparently hell on earth between the pain and the blood draining down his throat, but he was able to breathe after. Ymmv
Literal mouthbreather here
Not for long
Hope you feel better soon
Mines been deviated going on 10 years. I keep saying I'm gonna get it fixed and just never go. Buddy had it done and he said it's an easy surgery.

Bought a lot of $ATVI on the dip, might buy calls too
Lol too early retard
I meant when casino opens lol
VisualMod says we got taper. Since it became known news in premarket, I think that means market opens with it priced in and we just keep climbing
QE/tapering is not something that gets priced in, otherwise we wouldve spiked 100% in the span of a month back in march 2020

you can expect SPY pumps to get weaker over the next 6 months, and by the time its over markets will be back to normal (aka not going up infinitely for no fukken reason)

It’s not overpriced at $60. It’s overpriced at $600.
True the company does already have a deal with Amazon
So just like Tesla
The IPO price does seem a bit rich but I may still take a nibble next week if the stock doesn't 🚀🚀🚀
Rivian will be the poor-mans EV investment.  I just dropped 20K into TSLA and will drop 5K into Rivian when it comes out.
They have a truck @ 70k with insanely positive reviews. Definitely interesting

Powell continues to use excessively dovish language at every turn. Basically making baby steps forward in the most dovish way possible

At what time does GME typically die down at times like this? Is it just morning pump or is it an all day thing?
that's not a thing lol. did you just make that up ?
Sometimes there’s a pattern I was wondering
it is completely random. no different from buying a lottery ticket.

Just pointing out it's not "mooning" if it's worth less now than the day you could first buy it.  That's what's known as a "depreciating asset"
It’s mooning if it’s 1 cent up from where I bought

$gme puts and $spy calls from earlier today looking good. Of course I am greedy so letem ride.
Make COIN open up the ledgers and let's fund whatever Biden wants.
I just got a few comments saying I don’t understand politics. Let me put it this way you absolute cunts- Biden won Virginia by 10 points. Virginia just elected a republican governor who was expected to lose the election and was not a Trump type candidate. Virginia was SOLIDLY in Dem’s pockets and they lost the governor seat. This doesn’t bode well for them. 

This means Biden just lost Congress. Or at least, republicans now see a light at the end of the tunnel. They see a way to win. They have the votes. They don’t need Trump. They have Congress in the bag in a few months. Same thing happened to Obama during midterms. 

Now that they know pretty soon that Congress will be theirs (if they swung Virginia, they’re probably going to kill the midterms), they will not cooperate. They will put added pressure on Manchin and no infrastructure bill will pass. 

It’s a bad outlook for the bill passing, which will shake investor confidence. That with the FOMC means today is likely to be bearish.
You must be new, government gridlock = super bull period.
Maybe. But right now investors seem to care more about the infrastructure bill. Or whatever they’re calling the multi-trillion bill they’re trying to pass now. 

If that waivers the whole market waivers.
Lol if you’re going to try to give a political take at least know what the fuck you’re talking about. The republicans want the infrastructure bill. They don’t want the other spending bill the dems are trying to pass. JFC you’re actually retarded. I just thought you were trolling earlier.
Then why hasn’t a single one voted for it? I think you’re missing the forest here my dude. 

Look at the big picture. Everyone is watching Virginia today. All eyes are on that race. It indicates the big giant spending bill democrats want … the one that started way high like 5t and has been cut to 1.5t… it just became an even bigger issue. 

This isn’t about politics. It’s about the market. And the market I think will care.
Lol how fucking dense are you? It’s two separate bills. The infrastructure bill has already passed the senate with a 60% majority vote (so yes republicans voted for it) and is now just waiting on the house to vote for it. The hold up is a separate spending bill the dems want to pass at the same time. JFC
Haha. Chill bro. Wow you really think caring about these little details makes you smart huh? 

But look at how wound up you are. So tense. So agitated. It’s cool dude. 

I was referring then to the spending bill. No need to get all twisted.
Lol I’m not wound up, just shocked at how stupid you are.
Nah bro you’re pretty wound up. Look at you trying to insult me still haha. 

You’re fucking frothing at the mouth the get the insults in. It’s like “oh yeah if I can call this guy stupid, fuck that will make me feel sosoooooo good about myself. Finally. I can love myself. Finally I’m worth more than just trash” 

That’s what you sound like. Insecure as fuck lol.
No, you didn't know the difference between a Governor and a Senator. Nice try.
Yeah, I thought he was trolling earlier. Now I realize he’s actually just that retarded.
It doesn’t matter. The state swung from blue to red. That indicates a reversal. That predicts the midterms race. 

This is what will be going through the minds of all the news talking heads today.
I see it differently. Government gridlock for the next year? Sounds like less uncertainty to me. ATHs won't stop any time soon.
> I'm not sure what this means.
❤️ when VMod decides to broadcast its uncertainty
Way to many political words,,,, you going to get banned 😬
It’s related to the infrastructure bill which is related to the market.
Way to save yourself at the end!
Dems will steal an important elections when they need to. Don’t get carried away.
Well said infrastructure would be the last pump before next recession. Possible it won’t be as deep though as if Dems held house and win senate
Virginia has always elected moderate types from either party. This isn't super unexpected and I doubt it influences anything.
Okay folks let all get back down to reality now….

I am happy with it but I want to see it go to 10,000
We really already ran GME. Time for something different like $SOFI or $ROOT with bunch of short interest as well so they will take off.
unfortunately not

This fake pump on GME, AMC, and other "meme stocks" which in reality are worth a tiny fraction of what their current market-caps suggest, is one last ditch effort right before the big volatility comes. Bulls, as sure as your dick is tiny, you can bet the dreaded t word is coming. Tapering! 👻 Stop living in a fantasy world, the party ends now and the real bear market begins. A market which won't stop until we see the bottom over 50% lower than what current prices are (I actually think 60-70% selloff is possible market wide). The time of the bear is nigh!

$ME is gonna blow up. I’m a noob but I think it’s also heavily shorted. Interest rate for borrowing shares is 8.5%
8.5% isn't much, lol
8.5% borrowing fee. Not short interest rate
I know. Shorts will only start to feel pressure once it's like 50% or above. The borrow fee is the annual percentage. So they pay like a penny a day to short the stock at percents that low.
No the borrowing fee was a monthly percentage
Schwab asked to borrow my shares for 8.5% a month
That might be what Schwab is paying you, but it's not what shorts are paying Schwab if the borrow fee for them is 8.5%. Trust me, I short stuff all the time. The borrow fee is annual percentage.

Intc is becoming a great value company. I’m in 100 shares and will sell spreads for all of next year.
if you like it at 50, you'll love it at 30
Not going to 30 with a p/e of 10 and earnings of 18 billion a quarter. CEO is aggressive in catching up with AMD and TSMC. Company is sitting on lots of cash all fundamentals point to a good 5 year outlook. MSFT was undervalued for over a decade and now look at it
you think earnings won't go down? hahaha
Not a bad idea but I'm also an INTC shill.
INTC has fumbled their leadership role the past 2 years. AMD and NVDA sapped all the power out of that company. What could have been a global chip leader in the time of high demand, decided to be a retard with boomer growth rate

Maybe it's overstock, get it?
Zillow puts printing so hard why did i not go all in
Attn people who know what they're doing. Is this GME a pullback or is it done for now?
#no one knows what they are doing
A full erasure of the daily candle is NOT a pullback. That was shorts exiting their position and then selling off the shares.
If you buy to cover a short, and then sell off the shares, you are still net short.
pull back to 200 then back up
If you're looking for people who know what they're doing, you could not possibly be farther away.

Here's how I feel right now.

How are we feeling about tomorrow, the market feels like it should keep going up, but there is clearly some resistance
Resistance to anal
Short term uncertainty re tapering is off table. If all that market surge soon as 2pm hit is any indication, lots of pent up trades about to hit rest of week.
i have one whole kernel of butcorn that i probably wont ever sell. how much do you think it will be worth in 20 years?
It'll be worth 5 ethereums
Or zero USD
ironically enough i have 5 of those too
man my ass just got gaped. I am going to lose my house if i dont make 10k back off 3k in the next two weeks. Please help.

W puts = free tenders

NET puts = free tenders
NET has ran up so much there's no way it continues even if they crush ER.
I’m betting big on that thesis. Currently trading at 100x revenue. Even TSLA trades at 20x. Absolutely retarded. But then again people who buy NET are room temp IQ so it doesn’t follow logic.
Spy please die after hours so I can get back in please and thanks

OCGN dump was predictable. We’re about to enter a red day regardless with JPOW potentially announcing tapering. And you SELL the news.

dude...come on jpow. The economy has been (mostly) open. Covid was a huge realization for companies to become more efficient. Notably through high skill workers and leveraging technology. People also don't want to commute 5 times a week to work for $10/hr anymore.

We're seeing a radical shift in the American workforce and jpow will still be waiting for the recovery to inefficient hires 1 year later.

If GME somehow makes it to 230 and holds it, the next target is 245. Wtf man
If your aunt had a dick she would be your uncle
And if it hits 245 the next is 260!

And if it hits 260 the target is 285!

And after 285 the target is definitely 300!

From 300 we’ll see 425!

425 is the catalyst for 750!

What? You mean the GME baggies had no idea what they were talking about again and got another prediction wrong ***again***?  


It's almost like they've never been right.
A guy made a GME 250 banbet yesterday. Thought it would go even higher when the "shorts were forced to cover." GME maxed out this morning around 247.

It's back down to $210. He bought $210 calls. I wonder how much time has decayed their value now.

all you degen's out there, I know you guys hate robinhood and the last thing you want to do is buy the stock but at the moment Robinhood is highly shorted. The borrow rate is currently at 130% to 150% depending on your broker. With meme stocks squeezing this stock has the most potential to the upside.

Does anyone know what time JPow is talking today? I see wrong information
2pm
I saw 2:30 but I don’t know if it’s right
If you didn't at least look at the RACE chart 2 days ago when I was telling you to buy a 245c I feel bad for you
Wow pltr fuckd me over
By doing what it's been doing for months?
$X gon' give it to ya
ITCI:  Upcoming PDUFA from the FDA for Intra-Cellular's blockbuster drug, Caplyta, is expected December 17.  All indications are that this will be approved with no issues.  Do your DD, but I expect this company to rocket from $47.  Consider getting in early!!

Why is WING gettin shit on
MarketWatch: *Wingstop shares drop after profit and revenue miss*
> VisualMod: I think the best way to answer this question is by looking at a chart of Wingstop's stock price over time.
Lmao
That’s a bummer they have such great wings and fry seasonings
Anyone playing $ATVI rebound?
Yeah I think it dipped way too hard. Especially if there are gonna be holiday shortages too.
Is atvi trying to recover? Buy?

Edit: nevermind
I don't understand why ATVI is down close to 15% post earnings, numbers were not bad. And new Call of Duty launch is day after tomorrow.
looks like an overreaction to me. I bought in AH yesterday, wish i had waited to buy at these bargain basement prices. but oh well still got a discount.
I am going to wait till end of day today and will start adding to my long-term portfolio. It's a profit making company with reasonable PE ratio.
ya i think it's a solid value buy. it might take a little bit to recover from this but analysts are giving it a gigantic upside, and they continue to grow.

bed bath and beyond  kroger deal
Bed Bath and Beyond had an after hours announcement of a ~~merger~~ partnership with Kroger and an online platform. Plus they moved up their timetable to buy back shares 2 years ahead of schedule. 

And when one goes, usually most of the memes go
Aaaahhhh okay. I missed the news. Just had stupid amount of alerts going off lol
My guess was a FOMC run up to small caps but who knows for certain

Probably just profit takers. Fundamentals still project it as undervalued even at $12

Thoughts on XPO earnings?
what's so bad about jpow spooking the markets? Euphoria at retardation levels already 👻
Some of us like to make money and that’s easier to do when stocks only go one direction.
So, it's easier to make money if stocks only go down?
Should I dollar cost average on snap or just yolo it all at once?
DCA as it goes to zero, all in as it goes to zero. Same thing.
This is WSB, we YOLO.
Snap is the biggest cock tease stock, goes up crashes down. If you can swing it do so because you'd probably make bank
There is a small chance that the market makers may want to drop it to the 40s but it dosent seem likely imo(assuming no news catalysts). I would start at least half of your target position size at these levels or more depending on your conviction in the stock.

Sneaker
For designer brands - a lot of the Nike collaborations they do with design houses are good and comfortable. 

If you want super high end designer sneakers you can try Balenciaga’s they’re pretty comfortable.

What will SQ do at earnings tomorrow 🎱
Hopefully rip, my Dec calls are not looking great right now.  Been acting like a bitch for awhile now.
If the market panics we sell off with it. Could continue into tomorrow and the market will rebalance. Earnings will be good so could take off after that. Its just how low will it be when in it does so

What happened to BROS?? Why the sudden dive
> It is a combination of things. Firstly, the market was overbought and it had to correct itself at some point. Secondly, there were several whales who bought in around $0.15-$0.20 range and they are now dumping their bags as we speak for profits (they will come back with more BROS once this dump settles). Thirdly, people started panicking after seeing such a steep drop without any apparent reason - which led them to sell off their holdings as well (which further increased the price plummet).

Volatility is shit low, I know because I have bleeding calls on that.
Am I calling or putting COIN earnings?
Well coin is at an all time high. Id sit it out.

Pls AAPL just go up a dollar
My portfolio is over 70% $OUST. Current average is $7.30 a share. Could either be one of the dumbest or smartest decisions I’ve ever made. I truly believe in $OUST long term though. Not down too much at the moment. We’ll see how it goes. I’m holding for the long haul though.
Yes yes thats a very safe play
Can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic or not, but I truly do believe that $OUST will be a big success in the long term. I’ve probably done days worth of DD on them. I’ve definitely been wrong before though, so I’m prepared to be wrong again. Time will tell. Not selling anytime soon though. This is a long play for me, and I have 100% conviction in $OUST.
Why oust? Aren't there a bunch of companies in the space doing similar stuff, velodyne?
Yes there are several other competitors in the space, but $OUST is currently the only publicly traded company offering digital solid state lidar which (due to Moore’s Law) is far cheaper to manufacture, requires far less parts, and is far more scalable that the analog lidar used by their competitors (ie. Velodyne). They also have built a fantastic team. They just acquired Sense Photonics (another digital LiDAR company) in an all stock deal that basically added 80 experienced engineers to their team and allowed them to form the Ouster Automotive division, they just announced a couple deals in the last couple weeks with Local Motors and Perrone Robotics to produce thousands of sensors for them through 2023 and potentially tens of thousands more by 2025, they recently added the CEO of Mercedes-Benz Trucks to their board of directors, and they just announced that they’ve doubled the processing power of their new L2X chip. They’ve met all of their goals for 2021 so far, and they currently have over 600 existing customers and around 300 existing patents. And last but not least I like that they’re focusing the majority of the business on the industrial sector rather than just the automotive sector like their competitors. Lidar has so many use cases outside of just Auto (ie. autonomous drones, autonomous mining equipment, autonomous factory equipment, 3D mapping, autonomous factory robot, and much more). I’ve done a lot of research into $OUST, and I truly believe they’ll be a success. Like I said tough, I could be wrong. Just my 2 cents.

Does the real estate stock meltdown have any implications for the housing market like I hope it does?
No. Zillow owned almost no houses, has absolutely no effect.
7000 Homes is a lot if it’s mainly In one state and might ruin a couple neighborhoods . If it’s 7000
Across every state then there will be no issue .

Long term though we will see a lot of people who over paid 50-100k like them selling at a loss
Or they will have negative equity for a very long time
Zillow owned <$2B of homes.

US housing market is >$40T.

There will be no effect. Zillow was not a major buyer, they were not driving home price increases - they were overpaying for houses they’re now selling at a loss!
Sure, but the other real estate stocks went down in tandem.
KB Home peaked 5 months ago - housing market still chugging along just fine.
Puts on CAR?
CAR IV is -999. I don’t know what that means.
More like 9,999

VXX is almost guaranteed to pop within the next 2 weeks
What exactly am I looking at here?

Short Term Futures?

So if the market crashes....this goes up?
Yes, follows a certain volatility cycle. Spy is due for a pullback. If we go up on FOMC, we’re not at the VXX bottom yet. You could get probably at least a 25% move overnight when it goes up
Thank you for this...Interesting to take a look at it.

Going through the [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080715/etf-analysis-ipath-sp-500-vix-futures-vxx.asp)  right now to understand it more as best as I can.

Seems like something I want to be into as I am certain that this Market cannot keep going up the way it is, but also seems like a bit of risk hold due to being able to make money in other ways when it does flip. Comments?
When Spy goes down and this goes up, a lot of other things in the market will be on sale, having gone down with Spy. You take your profits and buy the dip on something else
In on it for the day...will see how it goes after the 1:30 announcement
If I was taking that trade, I would personally put a tight stop loss on it or DCA in, because I expect the market to go up on FOMC, which means you could potentially buy VXX lower. If people had legit fear of a pullback, VXX would’ve already been going up. I don’t think the pullback is today. But you do what you feel comfortable with.
Understood. Truly appreciate the insight on this!

It was a 50/50 split with the VP tipping the balance. They lost Virginia last night to a republican challenger. Now they hold a majority.
That was a governor race
Which indicates … what? Come on buddy. You can do it. Use your brain.
Idk if you're joking or not. The governor doesn't vote on federal bills and the influence of the governor won't have a huge impact till the next senatorial race in that state
Right which is just around the corner. Investors will see this as a preview of things to come.
Are you from the US? Because if so our school system has majorly failed you in the “how our government works” department

CALL OPTION NOOB

Sorry for the dumb question but just bought my first call option on SDC $7 Nov 12 (Earnings out on the 8th). So far up 42%, but my question is do I have to sell before to make a profit? Or if I do nothing at all and it goes over on Nov 12, will it automatically close and funds into my account? TIA!
First ones free. Sell it fool
If you don't sell and you have the funds your broker may exercise the call, meaning that you buy the shares for the strike price. Bit of advice, take profits sometimes +42% can go to -99% real quick
Now 21% ugh, growing pains. I'm still a believer it's about to blow.
Fuck missed ATVI dip
no you didn't. it's still near opening price

I picked up some protective puts for earnings. Their past earnings performance has been trash.
Earnings dont matter they're always trash this is an FDA approval momentum play for me
Same but I wouldn't making a quick play with puts prior to fda. Fda approval in the next 2 weeks would not be the best for the puts but what is the chance of that and earnings in the same week? Like 4/52
I mean I'll probs get some 3.5 puts or 4 puts next week if it runs up just in case, I'm sitting on a $3k position in Jan 2022 calls the open interest on that chain is fucking nuts.
I too have some January calls. Bunch of shares too. This thing has incredible potential and approval seems like a sure thing.
Oh I have no doubt about approval, think 10 bagger at least, gonna wake up one morning it SENS will be up over 100%

Beginning later this month, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $70 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $35 billion per month. Beginning in December, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $60 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $30 billion per month.

Drill to core of earth
It has to rebound. I don’t know if this week tho. Give it a month maybe. Sexual harassment scandal will pass and sorry to say, but it’s not going to affect the share price in the future. It should slowly start to creep back up around next earnings where they will probably announce some new titles.

RIOT is the play this week.

&#x200B;

OI on the call chain was mostly low delta at the beginning of the week.  Heavy, heavy daily shorting for the last two months.

&#x200B;

Bullish numbers on their October mining report.

&#x200B;

ER is 11/15 after hours (not 11/8 as still estimated on websites).

&#x200B;

Last chance to get in before it starts to retest ATHs of $79 by year end.  Assuming it makes up a good bit of that this week with the momentum of necessary buy-ins.

&#x200B;

Unlike MARA, their shelf offering is more than likely over and they are flush with cash ($600M from shelf).  MARA is probably announcing a substantial ($400M+) ATM equity raise in the next few weeks since they only have $20 million cash on hand.
They are diluted to hell my guy they aren’t hitting ath
Total outstanding share count (including executive shares issued after annual meeting) is probably around 125 million with the shelf offering closed.  And more than likely it has been closed for the last two weeks.

&#x200B;

Shelf cash of $600,000,000 plus $125,000,000 cash from 2Q21 ER plus approx. $250,000,000 in mined corn plus around $250,000,000 in real estate and hardware puts their book value at $1.2 Billion.  That's approximately $10 to $11 per share.

&#x200B;

They are cash flow positive.

&#x200B;

Their 200 MW of institutional lease agreements generate cash and, potentially, more corn.

&#x200B;

It is the most undervalued stock comparing it to peers on the market right now.

&#x200B;

Whinstone is basically an AWS of the corn mining world.  Rockdale, TX is the largest mining facility in the US and the US accounts for over a third of the world's hash rate.

&#x200B;

Edited to add: they recently (within the last two months) deployed 40 MW of self-mining capacity at Whinstone.  The other 50 MW of capacity is still leased through Coolmint, LLC.  Their margins are increasing while others are seeing a decreased margin due to rising energy costs.

&#x200B;

All aboard!
too many words just give me a strike and exp dammit
$33C 11/5 should print big.

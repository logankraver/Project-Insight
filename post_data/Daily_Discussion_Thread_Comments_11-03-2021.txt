Checking a stock after you‚Äôve sold it sometimes feels like looking at your ex‚Äôs Instagram
My 4 month old survived his kidney operation, I am so relieved, I have no friends so I‚Äôm just venting here. Now LFG gme
Has two months to buy GME at 160-180.  Buys after it runs over 20 percent

Complains

Some people in this sub are so retarded lmao
Earned a quick $200 on a call then locked my keys in my car and had to pay $200 for a locksmith.

The universe giveth and taketh.
Come save me at $420 GME boys I‚Äôve been waiting almost a year lmao
Zillow employees Jan 2021: "I'd like to pay 20% over asking. Thanks"

Zillow employees Nov 2021: "Would you like fries with that?"
Don‚Äôt buy shit at open you dummies.
I just brought GME near its high lmao
Time to FOMO into meme stocks and lose money
#Ban Bet Won

/u/commieconfidential (1/1) made a bet that GME would go to 225.0 when it was 214.39 and it did, congrats fucker.
Boys, I feel like gambling today.
Down ~30k all time, up 50% last week üòé
#GME SWEET BABY JESUS
Zillow just lost the only thing that was suppose to make them money and people are saying buy the dip?

What's their new profit model, ad clicks on their website?

LMAO, trash fucking company has a bright idea to run up the housing market then suprise Pikachu's when no one quilifies for a loan for their expensive as fuck 2 bedrooms 1 bathroom shack in downtown Pheonix. 

They deserve to bleed to a penny stock.
!banbet GME $300 10d

/u/tallpaulpaultall (0/2) made a bet that SQ would go to 265.0 when it was 254.0 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Reporter: "What are your interest rate plans?"

JPow: "Bears r fuk"

Reporter: "What about inflation"

JPow: "Bears r fuk"

Reporter: "How will you know when to raise rates"

JPow: "When all bears r fuk"
I hope you fuckers make a stupid amount of money today
I have a feeling today is gonna be a wild fucking ride
Congrats OCGN gang
LMao OCGN isn‚Äôt being flagged as elevated volatility because it does this all the timeüòÇ
So I guess we're all buying into OCGN at open? Can't wait to add more bags to my collection!
650% profit on GME in 20 minutes I can‚Äôt complain lol
Buying GME calls yesterday before the yearly breakout today was the alpha play. Thanks retards!
Holy fuck having a ton of money and quitting my job it is the ultimate fantasy.  Until then I am literally a slave.  My daily routine for the next 20 years is something like, "Yes boss what dumbass code can I write for you today, sir?"
Lost like 7k on GME calls in like 5 mins :(
JPOW would be the perfect fall guy for tanking the markets.
  
Biden would hate to replace him with a diversity hire and have *them* tank the markets...
Zillow CFO should be given wsb hall of fame award for buying the top of the housing bubble, and then trying to sell the bottom.
IT IS NOW CALLED POWELLL HOURRRRR
GME go brrrrr
"fuck off with your rate talks, bear" -Jerome Powell 2021
I had to run to the bathroom 5 times within 2 hours last night and I‚Äôve already shit twice today at 6:24 am. I work in the field cutting down trees and shit. For some unknown reason I decided to go into work today. Think I‚Äôm gonna go home and trade instead
Made $200 on OCGN today with only 18,000 of risk üòé
This shit is not transitory Jerome. You‚Äôre going to fuck us.
I‚Äôm psychologically prepared for blood today.

But I know Jerome will pump this shit
OCGN is going to soar today!
OCGN price target anyone? üò≥
My timing is impeccably bad
I made $7,000 on meme stocks today. Really puts a dent in the -$20,000 all time losses I‚Äôve sustained
i have not sold my OCGN.
Zillow is going to Zerow
I keep flirting with that magic $25k account balance.
Flat if tapering begins this month, market rips if tapering begins in January (my guess).
Definitely quitting No Nut November today
18 million shares traded on OCGN premarket. Looking good.
Dont miss the $OCGN rocket my fellow retards!üöÄ
My ocgn $10 call expires in 2 years lol
BBBY and OCGN, let's fucking go

!banbet GME $450 1d
After my Covid shot my iPhones 5G is fast as fuck. It‚Äôs insane.
The gambling with your life saving rush, is one like no other.
Bull trap. Bear trap. Bull trap!
Remember, you make the most money on emotional decisions.
Glad I didn't take that job at Zillow...ouch.
Lol. I got denied for margin on my new fidelity account. Then i applied again but exaggerated my net worth/liquidity and i was instantly approved
Fuck it, tsla calls at open

Lol bears going to get fucked for trying to bet the other way on this taper
Oh no‚Ä¶ our market.. it‚Äôs broken
JPOW literally just said that if we dip too much they will pump the markets back up. 

Buy the dip.
SPY 500 EOY isnt a meme

Congrats TSLAtards!

/u/When_Rug_Pull (2/0) made a bet that GME would go to 240.0 when it was 218.2 and it did, congrats retard.
I‚Äôm taking a massive dump so that the market doesn‚Äôt have to.
Some of you never heard of sell the news and it shows
OCGN EUL approval üöÄ
Watching OCGN rise is making me anxious, like either that is gonna shoot up and make my calls print so haaaaard or just get obliterated upon open and make me lose it all. Blood pressure and heart rate are JACKED.
I‚Äôm squealing! $OCGN baby! Patience paid off
GME gamma ramping
Does anyone buy shares just to make it a nice number? Like fuck owning 497 shares imma overpay just to get those 3 more
GME stop playing! I have a doggo to feed
Jerome just whispered in my ear we all good then walked out of the shower
Is spy now a meme stock?
Damn JPow is so careful what he says.

Bidens agenda depends on this man's word. Crazy power
from the bottom of my heart. Bears deserve this. Get rekt you toxic cunts ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)

/u/DigitalSoldier1776 (1/0) made a bet that GME would go to 231.0 when it was 183.83 and it did, congrats autist.
Bought TSLA puts at the bottom yesterday, now I bought calls at the top.  LFG fellow retards.
Imagine waking up and thinking about other things than stonks. Sad thought
Damn boii, OCGN going mad this morning, I like it :)
OCGN homies
Go TSLA go!
**AMC GME BB FLYYY**
Where are my OCGN long Investors at

‚ÄúLeTs gEt tHis bReAd‚Äù more like let‚Äôs watch my portfolio drop 50% in the first minute of trading
Whether it goes up or down today, one thing is for sure: OCGN is going to be volatile as a motherfucker
Ocgn I‚Äôm in.
Regret not going all in on OCGN calls.  Its like 90% of the contracts ITM
Good ole GME
GME is gonna have another +90% day
I have a gambling problem. üé∞
Wtf is OCGN doing bruh
Hypauthetically, If we all flipped the TSLA calls to puts we could lay this baby back down to 1k in style. Only saying this because I hate upvotes
It just occurred to me that I could set up an ABNB account, rent a Bunch of rooms, then hand out vouchers to homeless people to squat in those rooms, tell them they never have to leave and the cops can't kick them out, and buy ABNB puts. I would be solving the homeless crisis while making $ when it gets reported in the news that dozens of homeless are squatting in random ABNBs and can't be kicked out. Genius
Zillow literally bagholding billions in real estate

There go SPY. Must be some bad news.
oh my god, that elevator on SPY
Holy fuck. Tapering is good for SPY?
JPOW to continue asset purchases but only in the metaverse
ATHs will continue until morale improves
Too much hype in here. SPY will now trade sideways for the remainder of forever. Thanks for playing
Bears stuck in the past, SPY to 750 BOYS
So basically JPow is the CEO of SPY and QQQ.
 I guess SPY forgot to dump, it's back at the top again.  Silly SPY.
Cathy wood bought 25 million of Zillow yesterday‚Ä¶..
JPOW: no one is working, supply chain issues, inflation rampant....everything is good, keep printing.

/u/fe2sio4 (1/1) made a bet that Z would go to 65.0 when it was 76.26 and it did, congrats you fuckin nerd.

‚ÄúInflation is transitory, fuck poor people, SPY to Andromada (SPY 690c 12/17)‚Äù

/u/NarNights (1/1) made a bet that VXX would go to 26.0 when it was 21.96 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
looking at tesla daily chart gives me vertigo
Puts on QQQ seems like the obvious move so call is the play I guess
Who else can‚Äôt sleep because of today‚Äôs hype? Let‚Äôs see some volatility in this circus.

Got 0DTE 462 calls and 460 puts. Let's ride the lightning!
No matter what happens during the fed meeting today, I'm sure to lose money
For people wondering if they should buy Zillow, please go understand why it tanked in the first place.  The CEO did not sound confident and they‚Äôre cutting 25% of workers. 50 EOM
SPY CEO about to announce earnings in 15mins, who got puts
It‚Äôs transitory and it always was
Algos gone wild. Seems fake AF. Don‚Äôt get conned.
Six months ago: "Inflation is high right now, but give it 6 months and things will very likely go back to normal on their own."  


Today: "Inflation is high right now, but give it 6 months and things will very likely go back to normal on their own."
TSLA going to the moon you dumbasses
AAPL is making 27x in profit compared to TSLA, but TSLA is already half AAPL market cap. Must be a sign that TSLA is gonna be 27 trillion market cap!!!

HOLY SHIT OCGN
OCGN shorts today: 

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Taper pretty much announced without announcing it yet this morning 

Should be fun today
You probably have about 5 seconds when the market opens to do anything with OCGN before it's halted
Looking at OCGN it has a 30% short / 56.98M shorted against it, I'm guessing in the anticipation of WHO delaying or not authorising. 

Now WHO has authorised it and pre market looks so good could there be a short squeeze??????

I'm not expert just looking at data
If you ever feel dumb for making a stupid trade, just go over to r/stocks. Reading their questions and comments will make you feel real smart, real quick

So yes tapering, no rate hike?
Lmao took Powell like 10 seconds to figure out how to answer that question
There could be a war between US and China and SP500 would still go up.

I think GME gearing up for another ride uppies into the afternoon
In his final move, J Pow brought a shock interest rate increase that tanked SPY and forced boomers out of retirement. Full employment was achieved as J Pow rode into the sunset.
YOLO on SPY calls?
Zillow puts were the move.

GREEEEENNN DILDOS

Zillow keeps exiting the screen and the app has to zoom out constantly to keep up with the freefall. Love to see it.
im beginning to think that RIVIAN IPO next week will be the biggest first day stock gainage maybe in history
Ok. I‚Äôm gonna need TSLA to moon to save my weeklies.  

Any time now would be great.
But mommy the guy at McDonald's said Ocugen was going to hit $60
Meanwhile in a bathroom at the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell stares intensely at the mirror in front of him. "Transitory" he said. "Trannnnnsitory. It is transitory. We will be highly accommodative. Accommodative. Highly Accommodative." 

"They are ready for you Mr. Powell" an intern said as he opened the door. 

Jerome straightened his tie and took one last look into the mirror. "Time to fuck your puts to death" he said to himself as he left the room with the smell of printer ink still fresh in the air.
Algos are happy.
JPOW boutta hit a line of coke. Crank the printers up boys
Wow. 11 million people on this sub now. Been a while. Hello new retards.
I love when people come here trying to make sense. That‚Äôs how you lose money. This sub is about being as retarded as possible and having it work out anyways.
Fed news was bearish af for the long term but well, nobody gives a fuck about the long term
[deleted]
bulls blew their load a little to fast
If there is inflation we need to raise wages to match the inflation. Its criminal to let people get priced out by oil price inflation and supply chain screw ups.
Aaaand this is why you don‚Äôt over leverage yourself with puts when the fed speaks.
Zillow got taken out back and brutally jumped. Love to see it.
Spy could go from 800 to 740, 3 years from now and bears will say ‚ÄúI TOLD YOU IDIOT! I KNEW THIS WHOLE TIME‚Äù ü§° instead of just making money
Im in for a 10k loss if papa JPOW doesnt jam the printer.
If $JPOW were a ticker I‚Äôd buy. Full send king.
Bears so broke they don‚Äôt even have shambles left.
For all of you who need the reminder today:

Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.

Yes
Are you expecting a rate hike?
Expecting some tantrum around tapering.
If I've learned anything, It's all priced in.
Probably fair. It's a hedge for the rest of my portfolio.
That confident huh?
It's kind of a hedge against the rest of my port, but can see upside if everything tanks
Those are like 5 bucks a piece haha. It's not that expensive.

You‚Äôre kidding right? What he said wasn‚Äôt bullish by any means.

Wasn‚Äôt bearish either
He said no raise in interest rates until full employment and he wont know what that looks like til the middle of next year. That is bullish.
It didn't have to be.  Too good means rates rise and that tanks the market.

Theoretically, why can‚Äôt we kick the can forever? At least until we‚Äôre all dead ya know?
Depends how old you are. Boomers are extremely good at doing shit that benefits them and then dying before they have to deal with the consequences.
That's what JPOW is trying to figure out, too.
as long as wages rise to compensate. if they don't, and inflation gets high, no one will buy anything and well go into a recession like in the seventies.
I was thinking the same thing. If we have a debt based economy essentially, why wouldn‚Äôt they just lean in heavy and lend shit tons of money out to build new technology and infrastructure. I feel like we have yet to build ghost cities to spoof our gdp like China. Maybe that‚Äôs the next step just massive deficits to throw gobs of money at infrastructure and crazy space stations and shit.

Dirty peasant here, that's a ton of money in addition to normal income.
Considering the average idiot here has a $10k account, that's basically impossible.  Now maybe if you're good with a $250k account, that's possible, but still unlikely. I target about 1-1.25% per month

Gonna smell like FOMO in here soon.
Tesla it‚Äôs okay you don‚Äôt have to be scared of 1,190
Seriously not even a wall there
I got BBBY puts so it's going to go up here.  You're welcome
Bought Tesla 1800c 12/5 as a joke/ lottery ticket a couple weeks ago bc they were super cheap‚Ä¶..they are up 155% lmao üòÇ
Yesterday morning @ 940am my 11/12 1500C's were priced at $750 now worth $218 guh
Wait until after lunch you will be good
Days like today remind me why I just like the stock
BB this is your time to shine ‚ú®
Fuck you to whoever has got GME calls.
GME AMC and BB are getting me paid like its Feb again

300, do I hear 300?
Quite possibly my worst week of trading, with that being said dont chase your losses fellas.
Did this in early October and lost 50%. Halfway back now. You got this
Turned a 10K loss into a 14K loss by doing that. Tough lesson, hang in there!

Thanks I was freaking out for a second.
Sell for a loss?
I originally planned on being productive at work today‚Ä¶
The next big move for guhME is probably coming within the nextd 15-30 minutes
AMC should just show viewings of meme stock tickers like GME

The market is down but my portfolio is spilling over with green dildos.
Picked up an OCGN leap for next Spring, (should be able to sell during the winter COVID peak when their vaccine is in hot demand).
Should be gold at some point.
If anyone is buying Zillow after these news I honestly admire your level of retardness
Bought Calls yesterday before earnings. 
Your welcome üôè
Honestly it is pretty fucking baller that puts on GME within any timeframe is mostly always useless
No push them out 1 month and once it falls back to 180 you cash out
The higher it goes the slower it bleeds and the higher the IV, last small spike took over 1.5 months to see a 40 point drop. Timing the purchase and getting the correct expiration is basically playing Russian roulette with a 9mm
Is that how all puts are anyway? You can get 2 month put at 200 from here and be assured of profit
You‚Äôd absolutely lose money on that play and no all outs aren‚Äôt like that because not every option chain has to account in for potential 200% moves every other day lmao
I mean I don't care either way I have shares so I don't need to gamble on options but I seen people do well on puts for GME timing them out a month or 2 that is without mentioning it is entirely possible it can flash crash like it did during January 

You can profit in puts your timing is just shit
Train to 300 is at the station choochooo

Ok, I thought it was going to be Meme day but I guess it was just Meme first hour.
The same formula as always. Shorts got screwed on Avis and bed bath needed some liquidity sump pump and dump and sell the premium on all the memes and then take that cash go back and short the original stocks some more
The market is surprisingly not reeing as much as I would have expected going into a likely JPow taper announcement. Is the taper already pRicEd iN?
You haven‚Äôt seen what the market does before these meetings. Currently movement is bearish AF to me. Not doing anything until EOD.
$15 billion taper is priced in I think if its more then we going down. 

If its only $15 billion it means we will have many many billions still entering the market for many months.

Market experts and economists widely expect the Federal Reserve to start tapering either in November or in December, at a speed of about $10b less in treasuries and $5b less in mortgage-backed securities per month.

 Beginning later this month, the Committee will increase its holdings of  
Treasury securities by at least $70 billion per month and of agency mortgage‚Äëbacked  
securities by at least $35 billion per month. Beginning in December, the Committee  
will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $60 billion per month and  
of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $30 billion per month. The  
Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely  
be appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if  
warranted by changes in the economic outlook. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs ongoing  
purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market  
functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of  
credit to households and businesses.
I see this as good

What‚Äôs all this concern about Tapirs? I think they are a funny animal.
Going to need Powell to shapeshift into a literal dove today üïäüñ® üíµüíµüíµ
Way overleveraged in SNAP. Might need to reconsider.
Same ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥
Me too. All in and squeezing my balls
$Z falling off a cliff! Downgrades already out as expected. LFG!!
Knew I should have grabbed those puts as soon as that news broke about them selling all their properties at a loss. Fucking morons running the show over there. Lol
Yeah I‚Äôm pissed I didn‚Äôt load up on puts on Monday when the news broke. That was god‚Äôs gift
Same.
Didn't grab puts so I'll settle for schadenfreude
OCGN price for today? Call it‚Ä¶
$45
D‚Äôs got their shit kicked in last night
The pendulum got swung way too hard to the left. It‚Äôs going to swing back like a right wrecking ball. Calls on REE.
Why can‚Äôt I sell my Zillow premarket on TD?
No buyers![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
you should be able too, there might be an option to sell during extended hours
There normally is but this shit won‚Äôt sell
No one is buying
Might have to lower your ask.
Change tif to Gtc_ext
Everything is priced in get in losers
How low will Z go? 25?
Markets booming in the face of taper and evergrande etc for weeks and the day I pull the trigger on a somewhat large bet, all of the sudden tapering matters again in the news.
R u serious? 

Y do u wanna buy at the top
I bought into one ticker in particular with low mkt cap and has a lot of room to grow compared to inflated peers. I‚Äôm going to stick with it, just frustrating in general.

If I bought spy calls or memes I‚Äôd be sweating
The top is in December-Jan not right now
As Musk‚Äôs wealth rises, he is now worth more than several automotive companies combined.
Go TITS!
How far down we think Zillow is bleeding today
Hopefully it bleeds out
I‚Äôm going to short it at open, try and make a quick small profit out of it, after a couple of days I‚Äôm gonna take a long position out on it as long term I reckon it will recover
I like my stocks like I like my coffee, 

>!Frothy !<
I‚Äôve got some coffee stonks I‚Äôll sell you. Give you them for what I paid. Fair deal.
Fair as fuck. Trust me BROS.

Hoping BB gets a boost from ticker mix ups with BBBY.
Loving $SOFI. I also just bought $25 Jan 22 on $OPEN. This sympathy dip is exaggerated and think they crush ER

Edit: timed those leaps perfect at $21.3, flying past $22 on OPEN! LFG

OCGN slammed into the earth on that approval.

If it ain't FDA it doesn't mean shit
We don‚Äôt need OCGN product in the USA. We have better vaccines. But they only have like a 2 week shelf life. 

This vaccine is for poorer countries with way bigger populations that the USA. It has a 12 month shelf life.
That's my point. Nobody giving a shit about things FDA does not care about
Ocgn owners didn‚Äôt know about the sell the news Shit common this past yr in bio
Only difference between BB AMC and GME is IV, and BB is the lowest, so I'm in on BB 1/21 20c lfgoooooooooooo
Too far bruh, 11/5
I‚Äôm wrong more than I am right in this shit but the ability to cut your losses and let your winners run means I‚Äôm way up on the year (still a thousand down all time but that was 10k so I am definitely catching up) my point is.

If there‚Äôs a cliche lifestyle attached to this shoe then I'm unfamiliar. I just wanted something comfortable that I could get away with wearing at the office
its whats in your mouth
Excellent shoes. /S

Like holy hell how does it keep on dumping?
nobody‚Äôs shorting PayPal lol
It's down to 226. Do you think it's people just dumping stock over nothing?
it‚Äôs a bear trap/shaking out weak hands, you‚Äôll see when big money comes in, just wait for earnings
I bought a hundred shares at 252. Lol.

I did just buy another 15 though. Hopefully you're right.
It's gonna rocket after FED meeting

Ya it's a Trillion $ company. Zillow plays in the sandbox.
I‚Äôm so down bad bro
And ocugen has created a new generation of bag holders. The stocks giveth to some, and take from many. Trudge on retards.
There are 3 more good news on the way soon so they might baghold for a month. But if you bought at original DD $9 youd be up 50% still

How would the stock market react to a POTUS death by covid? Has that ever happened
Has the POTUS died from Covid before is what you are asking? Is that not what got Garfield??
Considering covid didn't exist until Fauci made it in China, no it's never happened
Has POTUS ever died to COVID? I dunno, I mean we've had 18 other versions of it, right? It's possible one died to like Covid-2.
> No.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)  VS ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
IDK why people are buying ATVI on "the dip".  The stock tanked for a reason.  Q4 looks grim.  They have the new CoD and candy crush.  The entire blizzard half of the company is in shambles right now with zero positive outlook for the next 2 quarters.
Major vaccine approval news. Sp drops 5 dollars. Makes sense.
It does not impact their sales you fucking ape
But it will dumbass
So everyone is waiting for the fed chair to say what he's been saying for months...

Got it.
It's now or December, if it's not now, the bulls get another run until December
Markets think he‚Äôs bluffing they want the drugs to last forever
Zillow spelt backwards: **Zero**
I think SPY sill dump, logically, the rest of you should buy calls
i just came back from jpow's bedroom (don't ask). you guys are in for a HUGE surprise
He's Yellen in a corset and tentacles?
Why did Robinhood put the about section first now when looking at a ticker.. like who needs to know that over the statistics..?
Apes lol
that‚Äôs right üòã
Only 14M volume on SPY by 1pm. If i was JPOW my dick would be throbbing at the power he wields
Why do I even bother looking at tickets between 10:30 and 2?
All you really need is to be in here to get a market sentiment
SPY puts or calls before the taper announcement? What time is it at?
2:30 EST
Yes

I regret it too
CLF down for 6 straight days. RIP call holders.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
That fake pump this morning
CLF... I remember that one. Bought at 30, it went to 90, held for 6% div. Tanked to single digits and cut divy... 

That acronym makes me sad :(
I‚Äôve been averaging down my 11/19s for four straight days ugh
kinda figured something out.  When an anomaly like Avis happens, it causes a bunch of Yolo'ers to become horny and in acts of FOMO desperation they start pumping the other meme stocks.  So the next time some shit like CAR happens, look for gaymestop or AMC to follow
‚ÄúHedge fund managers hate him‚Äù
look, it's happened 1 out of 1 times that I've paid attention.  If that's not a pattern I don't know what is
This is actually a decent theory.
Yah, has nothing to do with actual EPS being double estimates after having shit for earnings for years. Maybe Avis is the next Enron? Who knows, stop trying to make NovemBEAR happen.
Expect coordinated CLOV spam tonight
Someone tell me why I shouldn't buy PTON puts before earnings? I feel like people are sick of riding a fucking bike in their basements and have canceled their pton memberships.
> You should buy pton puts before earnings.
i dunno, winter is on the way and it's way easier to work out at home than it is to drag yourself to the gym
This would just be an earnings play on last quarter.
well i think at earnings they also discuss future plans no? how they expect to maintain growth etc etc? im not invested in it either way just shootin the shit
That's correct, but if they adjust their Q4 guidance lower, the stock price could dump.. that's what I'm hoping for at least.
good luck to ya then! on a personal note i kinda hate the pelotons and their fitness as a service model so i hope those puts print for ya
It's too obvious
Why would people buy OCGN after it goes up 100% in 5 days pricing in the potential good news, making it so if there isn‚Äôt any it will tank. Why?
Lol Z poots for sure...
Only DD you need for BIRD is that my wife's boyfriend said they are really comfy.

I told guys, buying puts would be too fucking obvious. I glad I held my calls.
Volatility Indexes just hit the fucking dirt
As soon as my order on spy puts get filled, massive green dildo. You're welcome
Maybe you're wrong about the catalyst. But at least we're at ATH so some general volatility/cooling down can make you some $$$.

Reporter: but...

J Pow: I said what I said
Imagine buying puts üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Why does this feel like a market-wide pump n dump
Because 90% of what he said was negative. But then he said they might consider adjusting rate hikes ya know if things change‚Ä¶wink.
Spy 469 cummin
Jpow says read the memo and stfu
JPow king of spin. Holy shit
My QQQ calls up 120%....im not fucking leaving üòÇüòÇ
Fucking rippin
Nov 19...382
talking heads: say something bearish.

Hell. Fucking. Yes.
Is there a bigger bull in history than jpow ??
> The reason why the bull is bigger than jpow, is because it has a big nose.
SPY down all day, finally moves up 

WSB: I should buy calls now that SPY is almost up half a percent.

i love it
who bought SPY puts before the speech, show yourselves!
i bought one lottery ticket lol
Jpow: In short fuck your puts!
Give us your price target JPow
TESLAAAAAAAAA

This has been quite an expensive hobby
Don‚Äôt buy puts
20 pt 5 min candle on TSLA
JPow is the best Fed Chair in my lifetime
certainly the sexiest
Jpow for president
Elon just cured cancer
You know the drill; TSLA UP = LCID UP

FREE $$$ 4 bulls, thanks daddy JEROME
Ahrm TSLA quite the bounce
Fuuuuck, I dumped my SPY call thinking the market was going to bear. That's what I get for betting against JPow.
"well........ uhhhhhh....... because reasons bro.... why you tryin to salt this rally?"
I think this is the most bullish the market has been since Feb 2020.  Nothing seems to matter just infinite buying at all time highs.  We‚Äôll see where that goes.
SPY is the new TSLA
>Nothing seems to matter just infinite buying at all time highs.  We‚Äôll see where that goes.

Based on this I'd guess up.
TESLA about to go fucking nuclear
Wanna know a good play? Calls on literally anything (except WISH)
The vaccine came in too quickly. 

- JPow
Imagine FOMC meetings in the metaverse
Pray for all of those that sold their spy calls earlier today üôè
I had stops to make sure I locked in profit just in case but these assholes really dropped it just enough to hit my stop and immediately reversed.
Fucking floor it Elon
JPow: I got your back, bulls.
Fukin ocgn the only bad play today
VIX going out of business
I heard the CEO resigned
It‚Äôs not possible to convey with words how fuk bears are
Can confirm. Pretty fucked.
This is fucking wild yo
Holy shit I can't wait for the second great depression man. Shits gonna be so fun with all the tiktokers like "me at the breadline ü§™"
They are already multi millionaires. They'll be paying you to mow their estate and you'll be thankful
TSLA gonna hit that ath
How‚Äôs the cash gang doing? Y‚Äôall okay?
WITAF Tesla??!!?
It's as easy as:

  
Find ticker that has dropped 15% overnight.

Try and see if there's news that could continue to fuck it.

If not, buy some OTM calls a few months out.  


Did this on ATVI today - it's barely moved and I'm up 20%.
VZIO prime candidate
Only down 5% over the last month so I'd skip for calls a few months out.

Down 30% over 6 months - for that reason, I'd buy LEAPS with confidence.
Bam bitches! Tsla new ath!!!
Lol we live in a world where a 40 dollar move in TSLA is only 3%
As long as the market stays on easy mode I'm a "professional" day trader.
Hurry and get them ford calls before close
Tsla to da fookin moon

GME making me so hard rn
Where we going with GME then apes? üöÄ
$300+ EOD
GME is now consolidating the morning buy rush, please hold for the next blast...
Really think it'll go back up again?
You‚Äôre in it bro!
Do we have any expectations on how high it'll go?
Damn straight I do. The last time we saw volume like this was one day in June, and a three or four day rush in May. I feel safe saying that this could go on a rise at least for 24 to 48 hours unless this is actually the MOASS, then all bets are off on how long it goes for.
Cathie is the biggest Zillow bagholder lmao she was buying at $200 ü§°
Yeah, it‚Äôs pretty apparent at this point that she‚Äôs fucking retarded and just got lucky during the post covid everything goes up rally.
Yeah just buying all

Similar positions to you. What‚Äôs your PT
GME = üåï

OCGN = sell 80% at $40-50 and ride the wave for the remaining.  This has Brooklyn Immuno written all over it when it spiked $8 to $50.
Time to FOMO into GME if you haven‚Äôt already. Just 1 share won‚Äôt hurt. Then DRS that share!
This is da WAY ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
GME is helping everyone fight inflation today. lets get these tendies
Just bought a Tesla put so it‚Äôs going 1200 in a sec. Yw boys
$1200-$1250 to finish the week
ME TOO, im holding 50k in POOTS
do you remember,

How the hell do you lose 30% on shares in a day
[deleted]
It will spike up again eventually in a few months. But yeah, you going to be bag holding for a while
Y would u do dat
I bought like 1.100 shares though
LOL
Sell CCs on them at the strike just above your cost basis. The only thing you‚Äôll lose is the time you could be in something else.
[deleted]
Yeah but if you keep selling them every week you can put those gains toward something else. 0DTE SPX took $150 to $2,800 for me once a couple months back.
SPY is buying 100,000 Teslas!!!

I in fact should have sold all those puts on OCGN for that sweet premium yesterday ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

Then shut your mouth VisualMod!
That's exactly what I did. Sold a couple 13p
Im gonna see if its volatile at open and try and snake some

You're going to buy them?
No im gonna theta gang the shit out of people
> This is a good idea.
FOMC notes will be dropped at 2 or 2:30 EST?

Right in time to drill
Hopfully numbers are bad so the market soars
We are having supply chain issues from excessive demand but someone just argued with me that you fix this by stimulating more demand
Maybe if we demand more supply?
Well, the longer the line of demand for something, the more economically feasible it becomes to increase output. So, they‚Äôre not totally wrong.

If there are 4 years worth of orders for an item, as opposed to 4 months, it suddenly makes a lot more sense to expand production.
This was a good point that I didn‚Äôt think of.
Yeahhhhh.. but it‚Äôs all circular. You can pretty much argue anything economically because it‚Äôs all such a jumbled mess üòÇ

jfc OCGN waited long enough to tweet about WHO approval. That should have been scheduled for 9:25.
Won that ban bet in 15 minutes lol. If GME breaks and holds $233 I'll be mind blown
I hope the dems are forced to roll out federal MJ legalisation to save their party. 

My US weed and TLRY stocks are bleeeeding
Earlier in the week: I‚Äôll sell some CC‚Äôs for $240 and $245 GME, because there‚Äôs no way it hits those numbers by the 12th. Opens etrade app today; Jesus fuckin Christ.
Gme doin its thing I guess.
CAR going to drop hard today
picked up 10 of each all for 11/5 Z 65p GME 250c and SPY 463c
Give me +50% day trade
Spy really getting pinned until JPOW speaks huh
You can turn off your screen and come back at 2 pm, spy will be at 461.30. 

It is gonna do swings within 50 cent range whole day until fed talk.
The problem with being a bear is that it's not like you can just be wrong when the market doesn't crash.
  
Instead the market runs 7% in three weeks without a single meaningful red day, pegging the RSIs on every timeline along the way, so it's like you're 5x wrong.
really? I couldn't tell by this burning pile of money they call my "portfolio"

God I really fucked myself with Zillow. Bought at the peak at $102, averaged down yesterday, loaded more after the earnings to wake up to it being around $70. 

Please, my asshole can only take so much üò¢
Tough luck, I‚Äôm all out of spit
I know how you feel, I lost a shit ton on PayPal.
$BB up over 8% too...been holding forever in the deep red. Do I finally get back to black?
The shitty thing with BB is that it's actually a quality stock that only moves with GME. Its value should be double from here, even without the meme value, but it just doesn't move
Ok now I understand, it was a bull trap. Thank you Stock Market! Very cool.
Holy buckets my gme fd is up a lot
LETS GO GME
Not gonna feel quite the same until I get an old fashioned GME halt

Inverse of meme stocks I‚Äôd say.  
Well the coins can actually be the biggest bubble, many funds maybe are using them for leverage and pumping these. Dump when in need of liquidity?
FOMO. ppl buy the top, and then sell the bottom, then move on to the next thing that's moving quickly.
Yes

I tried to buy a call for it yesterday but it never placed pretty mad about it

GME holds VWAP and how has to choose between making a decisive move up past R2 ($248) towards $270 or a decisive move down past VWAP back to $233 or $225 (maybe even $212).
Where's that autist on here that said to buy FIGS last Friday. I love you.
Hoping bb hits 20 today, been holding this for too long
keep hoping
At this point it‚Äôs gonna close red, looks like a bull trap
Why are OCGN contract 3x the price of SOFI? MM‚Äôs know it‚Äôs gonna rip that why. Demand is high af. Shorts losing the battle.

Alright I'm out of my Z trade. GL to everyone else holding.
Good call. It‚Äôs likely going to keep tanking. They admitted two major parts of their business model were flawed. The zestimsate and home buying.
took a fat loss pre market on the bump, I really don‚Äôt see how they are going to make money cause they started the home flipping for a turnaround as their ad business was dying

lol how dumb are you? do you know how to read graphs??
So you can read graphs and your able to see when the top is every single time? You must be rich? Was trying to be nice af first but you sound like a fucking moron. Fucking dickhead too

I remember when people were buying houses in NJ and CT based off of Zoom tours. Earlier this year. Truly unbelievable when you look back on it.
I can‚Äôt believe people would actually want to live in those states

Edit: I grew up in one of the listed states absolute shit holes
Doubt they wanna live there but a 5 bedroom house in CT could be had for what a 1 bedroom house in California is worth
Depends where. SW CT is probably the richest place on Earth.
Every state has its rich areas
Sure. But CT, NJ and some NY counties are the bedroom communities for NYC wealth. Greenwich alone has more billionaires than most countries.
Pretty sure CT also has some shit neighborhoods with houses for like $1300 a month mortgage lol
Maybe but I would not want to live in Cali either
East coast is garbage unless you‚Äôre at the beach

Is there any chance a taper announcement doesn't immediately tank the market? 0 dte puts are incredibly cheap
Last time it was a big tank then pump. Hard to time it
Cheap but also could take a big L on them
cheap because people will buy them cheap with your thinking and then they'll expire worthless at EOD when *surprise surprise* powell doesn't make tapering comments and the "market liked his lack of commentary"

Don‚Äôt get excited üêª.


We all knew Zillow was fake and ghey.
Damn Z puts paying out 20 dollars from breakeven still. That company is fuk.

SPY calls. It's always the move. I don't even know why I questioned it.
If Spy is red I'm buying calls.
Cause bears are sirens calling for your destruction with beautiful promises of insane gains from a market crash.
Dam I‚Äôm getting banned üòÇüò≠
Whats the bet
GME 280 EOW
I'm gonna tell y'all this because I like you. Don't come to the stock market tomorrow
Bears? Bulls? You theta gang you fuck?
I'm the ghost of taper's future. Everyone big fuk, including theta gang
Well shit...

Imma just going to pretend I didn't just spend my morning looking at charts and watching girls shake that ass on Tik Tok.
remember LULU a few years ago? if you want closure for not buying then, you have BIRD now.
Lululemon needs to work with AFRM
ONON instead.
This thread shows nobody knows how to use Trailing Stop Losses on their TSLA calls
It‚Äôs so funny how one red day wipes them out
There is an enormous PUTS open interest on TESLA with $750 strike... It's huge...
Candle in the green direction now‚Ä¶
Man I really broke my dick off in OCGN
Fuck it this is a fake ass dip. Holding. Don‚Äôt care. My options don‚Äôt expire for months.
I broke mine off in your mom.
Before or after she was buried?
TSLA üí© my puts be printing
*record scratch*
Jpow giveth Jpow taketh
What the OCUFUCK!
Honestly bro
How the fuck OCGN, this was supposed to be your moment of gefeatness
Smells strongly of hedges trying to get lowest call positions before they let it take off
allbirds... lol
I love that name, so cute! ü•∞
who fomoed in and got left holding the bags for BBBY ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Seriously fuck TSLA and how fast it
Moves. Weeklies are so fucked
the IV is insane
Clown market. Dumb shit mooning.
What‚Äôs mooning  ?
Fuck you, ICLN. Just fuck you.
I just bought this morning and am too afraid to check fuck
Anyone think VIX calls right about now are good? Just looking for a quick scalp cuz I'm guessing the market is gonna freakout before the FED meeting (probably won't hold through the meeting)
No idea what‚Äôs going on with tsla
Cathie is going to have to sell her $Z bags. 

There's nothing innovating about a company with a revenue source of selling promoted listings and showing ads. Her investment thesis changed completely.

She is a bit retarded, so what do I know.  She might just double down.
She did
Loaded Spy 462 calls come on Jpow don‚Äôt disappoint
Worth doing calls on the Buttcoin etf?
Only on a major reversal.
You're not that guy, PayPal.
1 hr more of just flat bullshit ü•¥
What stock should you buy if you catch a rat coming out of a toilet in NYC
$WISH
If JPow misses, we'll get an even bigger dove as FED chair. Meaning stocks will go up even higher.

If JPow delivers, we'll get a relief rally.

Basically to whatever happens, AAPL calls are the move imo. Lol
What call should I do ?
I won both Zillow and ATVI and they both crashed badly today. The good thing is I own shares so I can hold the bag forever.
Never have to worry about taxes GZ
Close my OCGN short?
$10-$11 EOD
AMZN been a turd for like a year
Gotta break out soon. 4000 leaps ?
They need to split their stock so more retail investors can buy their stock price prices out lots of retail.
Everyone thinks jpow is bringing the stocks down soon but it will be the opposite: literally every time stocks just go up. The algos already know the future so they do the exact opposite to ensure max pain and ensure max profits for them
Unless he learned he's getting canned!
Looks like no one is ever using electronic payments again. Totally makes sense V, MA, and Pypl have drilled.

You fucks got me to buy some OCGN calls but luckily i hedged so im barely bleeding
DIS consistently rapes me
I saw Mickey Mouse guest star on South Park, and he def sent those vibes.
Anyone following Cathie Wood on Zillow?

Cathie Wood‚Äôs Flagship ETF Buys More Zillow Shares Amid Steep Drop; ARK Investment fund bought 288,800 shares Tuesday, the day the real-estate company said it would exit the home-flipping business.
Following cathie woods might actually be the worst strategy to ever exist in the stock market

Get your  üçæready it‚Äôs happening!
2.5yrs out of college and im still using my .edu email. When do I retire it?
Never, .edu email addresses get you free student shit all the time
Pro tip of the day right here
I'm over a decade out still using that shit.
Spy isn't moving one way or another till JPOW giveth or taketh. Now is the time to do a straddle play and hope this MF pops or flops!!! 230 is gonna feel like a massive  bump of the white girl.
Everything on hold till JPOW...  buying more F now I think it will pop to $20
Gme 250 FDd seems like the play
Waiting for this conference is excruciating.
Learned a new word today: Monopsony. Instead of a monopoly where there is only one seller, in a Monopsony there is only one buyer. Sort of like Cathie Woods with Zillow.
Last line got me
A great example is amazon. They're not a true monopoly, but if you want to sell anything online, it's almost mandatory to sell via Amazon  so they're kind of a monopsony.
wait.... 0dte spy strangle?  The crickets are so loud, it can't end with a whimper today
Bad casino
Ellie Eilish
My first ever trade was buying the (almost) exact bottom of AAL last year at 8.75
Z could get really ugly
god i hope it does
Will JPOW be crucify if aggressive tapering is announced? Will sleepy Joe nominate a new FED chair?!  Found out next time Wallstreetbet Z!
I refuse to believe in this dip
Someone needs to be an absolute chad and go balls deep on 0DTE SPY Puts at 1:59pm today.
Just found out i got $4k knocked off my college tuition bill a few weeks back due to the covid relief bill. So, yeah, im making gains today no matter what the market does fuck yeaaaaaaaah
How‚Äôd you get that relief bill
I have no idea, i just got my monthly payment bill in my email and wondered why the fuck it was $4k lighter
Fuck yea, profitü§üüèΩü§üüèΩü§üüèΩ
My net worth is now less negative hell yeah!!
Fuckin bullshit. I better check mine lol
Yeah it was auto applied i didnt even do anything ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Considering the bill is 18 months old they must be pretty slow at rolling it out lmao
How badly z be run that in the middle of historic housing price boom they figured out how to suck so much.
Lol its hard to flip right now. With such inflated prices as well as no foreclosures. Before covid was best time to flip houses.
Another day where every move I make results in max losses.
When is Jerome spitting his bars?
5 minutes until the algos go crazy.
Very nervous. Holding 460 and 459 puts for 11/8
Gonna dump like they‚Äôre giving a Cleveland Steamer
This is gonna hurt isn't it
Not if buy F
Cathie Wood bought the crash on Zillow... I'm not sure what to think.
She‚Äôs holding the bag
cause she‚Äôs down 40%

Get ready for the biggest, greenest hulk dick you've ever seen. Jpow will announce some weak ass interest rate tapering shit and the amount of priced in rocket fuel is gonna send the market to alpha centuari.

lol, in WSB? lmfaooooooooo
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

BEARS GET FUCKED
very weak pump 

less than 1M SPY shares


market isn‚Äôt even close to digesting this
markets dont need to when algos do the pumping
this is quickly transitioning from fun to a little scary
The can has officially been kicked down the road, see you bears in 2023
The only thing I have done all day is stare at my phone smh
Saaaaaaame!
Boys I get being a bull is fun but what the fuck LMFAOO
Algos retarded üòÇ
Jpow hasn‚Äôt even spoken yet. What‚Äôs going on?
They released the minutes from the meeting.
They release the statement before he speaks
TRANSITORY
Spy middle finger pattern
So we tapering or not, make up your minds. Sheeesh!
We are. But the interest rate isn‚Äôt changing as well.
Guess I should have sold on that pump
Fuck it. i bought some friday calls on QQQ & SPY. this SHIT only goes up lmao. officially dump time
I did the exact opposite when the Nasdaq and s&p popped. Got lucky.
I appreciate your sacrifice.
Coin coming for y'all tards that bought at 400
**If you bought SPY calls before 1:30 just hold** 

**If you didn't wait till EOD and buy 11/12 calls 3-6 OTM**
PUTS*
K
Transitioning is transitory spy 7000 eod
can we do a taper every day?
Yes, Son.
You guys were drooling over OCGN all morning and now it's down almost -20%.
Not my calls, those are down 77%
Big number good
In at .25 beg of last year, sold 40 Cc for 10k today
So I forgot to cancel my limit order on SPY 11/10 puts before the meeting. My plan was to cancel at 1:45 if not filled. Oops.
amd 130. took a while
Gonna crack open a beer
Someone gonna need to hold SPY‚Äôs hair while she pukes in the club toilet pretty soon
Nobody worse then the lames holding up Zillow ü§°
JPOW Left a cinder block on the gas pedal
Welp this was literally the only thing on my radar of things that can tank the market. Time to get jacked to the "Texas Institute of Technology and Science" in calls
The fuck is this FED waiting room music so upbeat
Had a put, bought more puts, buying more puts
My SPY puts are suffocating me
No

Powell said y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt getting a used car for a good price any time soon
Hahaha this is so retarded.
Is he saying that he‚Äôs going to keep printing cause the economy is fine
Yes . Bears r fuk
He's saying the economy still needs support and inflation is good so we'll be accommodating still.
I am gay for Powell
Here come the questions trying to trip JPow up into tanking the market lol
LMAO the guy with the first question's face, he terrified of tapering
Powell is such a bullshitter
I need SPY above 465 tomorrow! let's GOOOOOOO

Each day SPY doesn't make a new ATH, JPow goes home sad.
Sad if true
JPOW: Watch me taper my giant dong to my leg while I jump right on into this printer
jerome talking to bears is hilarious
LOOOL sure that's why inflation is high cool cool. Fucking love it !!
Look at all those green candles.
Jpowell said fk the bears we going to ride this ship to jupiter
Can't believe I almost went cash gang fuck you bears lmao
If they change Powell we are FUCCKKEEDD
SPY really unchained, market was basically worried they would NOT taper
Now that we have a general time frame we‚Äôre golden. Plus he‚Äôs open to tapering the taper ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

Some retards need to realize that tapering only means fed will print less money per month but that doesn't mean they will stop printing.  J Pow's printer still goes Brrr till next year.
ngl this is a bit scary. Even tho my 465 are up 120% üò¨
Dam. Once this market is done for, what is my life gonna be.

To much fucking fun right now
up 220% on my calls today

Up 70% on my 11/19 480c's.  Sell now, or be a degenerate and keep holding?
Sell bro
Lol I got 11/19 470c and 475c
I‚Äôm up 88% on my 11/22 456c and I am holding out for 150%
JPOW needs to run for president
I'd vote for him

It‚Äôs so sad the rate of species extinction. I never thought I would see the bears die in real time, but that‚Äôs what happens when an entire species is gay.

Power hour this bitch
Is it me or JPOW don't know what he's talking about
It's you.

If inflation is transitory, please tell me what products are going to be repriced downwardly in the near future. Used cars? Not sure where the new supply would come from since these are *used* cars, and the relevant companies have been in a bidding war for used car stock for over a year. Metals? Demand is high because we use metal, and that's not going to change. Seems sticky as fuck to me. Getting into clown territory.
Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

Cool, except jpoww has singled out used cars for like a year.
But only poor people buy used cars
Who short tsla now?

WSJ has an Opinion piece today that mentions that in no 20-year calendar period in the past century has the market produced a negative return, and only twice has it returned less than 5%
Jpow just sounds like a big ass ramble. No idea what the fuck he is saying.
He‚Äôs told to dance and he‚Äôs putting on the greatest show of his life. Now dance jpow dance hahaha!
Either does he.
the fuck is this economy reopening shit? its been open for over a year now

Tesla just hit gas.
Puts seemed like a slam dunk going into today. 

Whenever something like this occurs always do the opposite and you will win.
Puts were the most retarded thing you could have done. It was beyond obvious to hold calls
or just look at what happened in the past. tapering happened b4, and the exact same thing happened.

Ffs, how is this bullish at all.
I don‚Äôt fucking understand it
It's dovish which is what is should
Seems like u aren‚Äôt knowledgeable about the topic of  Retard knowledge
Simple: the market hates uncertainty and uncertainty just dropped significantly. Capital will remain elevated, rates don't have a reason to shoot way up, and action on tapering will have almost no effect on inflation but most people are ignorant about macroeconomics and that includes many fund managers and fiscal advisors who mistake their ideological presumptions for hard economics... they're monetary policy hawks and they see this as a true response to inflation even if it's less than they want.
Red days are now illegal.

OCGN will break bearish from this pattern. Shorts will sell their shares at the end of the pendant pattern to force a break downwards. It will fight. Sometime around noon it will reverse into the $17‚Äôs again and then rockets from there. Every time. Break down from pattern. Struggle. Rocket up. Every single time.

The dips. Are. Fake.
I‚Äôm holding lol idgaf. OCGN to the moon and the haters can suck my dick.
Im pretty sure hedges manipulate good news to push everyone else out of the lower best positions, then they let it proper skyrocket

TOO TRUE :(
After nearly four years of buying QQQ puts, I'm starting to think that maybe QQQ puts was the wrong strategy.  


I'm gonna find the variant of me who did the opposite and bought only QQQ calls, and interrupt the triple blowjob he's receiving from the maids in his mansion to ask if I can borrow a few thousand. Then I'll use that to buy QQQ puts.

I think Pow is wearing one of those long lasting rubbers
It's ribbed and he turned it inside-out for HIS pleasure.
how likely is SOFI $100 by 2024?
I wish it would join the memes and stay 4-5x its actual value. Looking at your AMC/GME/DWAC
I like how you think those stocks are only 4-5x their actual value.
yea not enough shorts, i hope it meme to $100 so i can finally afford a meal at costco
Sorry, this one‚Äôs actually worth something as a business
I think it is too, but it started as a SPAC and snake oil salesman Chamath. I don't have high hopes for it looking at how the rest of his turned out. Still if you can ride one good wave and profit its worth it in the long run

yeah probably should've gotten then 12 but oh well. i figure i'll buy the 13 and then the 14 or whatever they call it next year and then from then on out trade in the 2 year old phone for the lower price on the new one and keep the 1 year old phone as a burner

Shorted 300 shares of $z here at $75 (stop set at $77) on this dead cat bounce! Die Zillow...
my puuuuuttttssss
It was over 90 when the news came out. That was the short signal
Was at $99 when I came across the news, but didn't know it was gonna shit the bed! I expect more selling over next few weeks...
Lets see how Zillow and BBBY impact the market today.
Very little on both. They aren't Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc..
Maybe you‚Äôre right, but the simultaneous upward pressure the announced buyback had on multiple stocks supports the derivatives basket, swap theory
Looks like I picked the wrong week to play TSLA weeklies.

I believe it was mentioned that tapering is not tied to an interest rate hike, but I may be wrong?
> You are correct. The Fed has never tied tapering to an interest rate hike, but it is sometimes mentioned in the same paragraph when they discuss raising rates.
Excellent. Thanks, mod.
The Fed base rate isn't the only thing that affects interest rates. In fact, rates have already gone up a bit since last month when Jerome said we probably taper in November.

They made over a billion in just microtransactions in Q3. They're going through a leadership shift and a PR nightmare right now but that isn't going to stop WOW and CoD Warzone players. Gamers don't give a fuck about PR issues.

Tips for dealing with a coworker that is a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness?
> The Jehovah‚Äôs Witness religion is a Christian denomination that has been around since the 19th century. The name of this religious group comes from its belief in Jesus Christ and his role as ‚Äúthe one true witness,‚Äù or prophet. Members of the faith believe that God sent Jesus to Earth to save humans from sin and death by sacrificing himself on their behalf at Calvary (or Golgotha).
Tell him to witness your gains
You gotta tell them to respect your own religion even if that is being agnostic. Escalate to your boss if they keep doing it but put your foot down first. My fam is JW and I tend to stay away from them.

My fucking CRWD puts ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968) I might need to give up on dream and become a boomer. Trading has not been working out for me lately.
This volatility will be going into overdrive at 2pm
So if fed announces tapering or rate hike or both, what‚Äôs the conventional wise investing from there on?
Some volatility probably. Flip a coin for which direction  we go.
0% chance of a rate hike lol.
Iffffffffff, what if . It‚Äôs a hypothetical question
If the fed hiked rates right now the market would absolutely shit the bed for at least a month, if not longer.
So what would you do in that situation? only asking cause I blew my account up yesterday lol trynna be a lame boomer and recoup my shit
The vastly more likely scenario is the fed announces the taper schedule and maybe 1-2 more board members see a rate hike or two in 2022 (it was an even split between 2022 and 2023 last meeting).

Your risk is that language around inflation changes to being slightly more hawkish or the schedule for tapering is more aggressive than expected.

I don‚Äôt see a ton of opportunity there tbh. If you want to get wild maybe grab some puts right before then sell if there‚Äôs a quick algo drop and buy calls at EOD.

Wow, we really live in a society

Dear market if you just pick a direction, any direction - you can have my ass.
>Haha, nope.

Zillow to zero
Just bought 11/12 $1400 TESLA Call.  how fuk am I?
Why the fuck wouldn‚Äôt you have bought it when it was RED. 

CHRIST you‚Äôre all beyond retarded. üòÇ
I did.  By the time I got this post up it turned green!
Oh. Good job then lol
How the turn tables TSLA
Took a $300 loss on Tsla would be $2k+ gain rn that fast. In minutes :(
Someone tell me if I can safely catch the falling knife that is Zillow please? I need my fingers. For nose picking and what not.
> If you catch a falling knife, it will cut your finger off.
Just one though?
I can confirm the knife is still falling
This is the intel I need
Meant to buy figs call 10 min before market close, it never got placed, woulda been a +4000% > <

Fuck you robinhood
Still gonna buy? I've been considering it
Is Tesla overvalued or is AAPL undervalued? Who knows üòÇ

If I have no day trades left but buy a 0DTE option will the automatic sell at 4:30pm count as a trade?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Yep
Yes
Yeah, they warn you before you buy it too
Yeah, they count day trades.
Aapl sellers making this run up sooooo slow
The real question is do I hold my Zillow puts until tomorrow?
FD's?
Expiration and strike?
Friday. 70$ and 65$
I'd look to sell part because theta's gonna kill you. I think it'll keep leaking lower.
Yeah think I‚Äôll exit position before close today
Hold them, market is gonna take a shit tomorrow
Sell some, secure that profit.  Let some ride.
Goddamn those ocgn bags are fucking heavy now...
At original DD the stock was below 9$
So if I made 3 day trades can I make a fourth? Yes, I‚Äôm poor
Yes, but you‚Äôll be placed into trading jail for 90 days.
It sucks in there man üòì
Yes but the 4th locks you out for 90 days.

Better make it count. üö´üêÄ
Looks like I‚Äôm diamond handing Tesla calls expiring Friday, I‚Äôm all in too
3 in a 5-day period are allowed.  A 4th will trigger a margin call.  Your broker will be keeping a counter for you.  If you buy one, buy another one, and then sell 2 at once, that is 2 day trades.
If you make a 4th trade your account won't get restricted until tomorrow. 

Just go crazy with all the trades you want.
If it‚Äôs the first time using the 4th day trade you should be able to get it removed.  However, use the ‚Äúget out of jail free‚Äù card wisely because you only get to use it once.  Contact your broker first to confirm.
DraftKings, why are you being a bitch!?! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Funny how a ‚Äòflat day‚Äô for tsla is still crazy volatile.
It‚Äôs only volatile if you look at the numbers, not really volatile when you look at %
Ok

Good

Are you sure the N doesn't stand for the N word? Looks like it
Any chance that Powell says something that makes market tank?  Thinking about longing an E mini but seems dangerous
I‚Äôm wondering the same. Investors sure don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to have any surprises.
The last thing the dude wants is to surprise the markets.

He has been saying for weeks that he is planning on tapering QE starting in November.

If that news comes out and we see a rate hike move within Q2/3 2022 (which bonds have already priced in) - We could see a nice rally especially if the US10Y stays below the 1.65 mark after the news comes out.
He knows he‚Äôs out. Might burn it all down. Who knows?
You know as much as jpow ‚Äúshould‚Äù say something to crash the market‚Ä¶he won‚Äôt. His buddies and his portfolio will drive higher and higher until February. He ll leave. The can will be kicked. The next person will be ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù for crashing a market that should have crashed in March of 2020. So your actual best bet is to pretend that nothing is wrong and nothing will go wrong and the market will reach all time all time high highs or atathhs for short
Fed release @ 2:00 EST

J Pow speaks at 2:30 EST

If you're holding a bunch of important shares or indexes and the market moons after the speeches, you'll go up. But if something bad happens you'll lose.

If you're not holding anything important right now, if it moons, nothing happens to you, but if it dips, you can buy and then wait for it to readjust (quickly)

So not owning right now is the only way to not lose and also definitely win.
what if it dips and then you yolo and then it dips even more.
That is what Socrates called "sucking nutsacks for the cream"
Good point. Everyone quickly sell all your holdings before the announcement.  All as one at the Ask

Tapering was priced in all along plot twist
Fed announced start of tapering at $15B per month (vs $120B month today, will be zero by June).  Inflation risks continue to be viewed as transitory. No mention of potential change in S/T rates (0-25 bp). Powell expected to stay dovish in comments at 230ET.  10yrTY 1.591% +4bp.
Well, I guess it‚Äôs time to dump my life savings into SPY

We have absolutely no clue when inflation will slow down but trust us it's definitely ending Q2
jpow is quite masterful at answering the question but not really answering the question. I'd just be like, "fuck around and find out"
Uh oh... Hard question for Powell
why is kevin o'leary a reporter now?

And let inflation just run away. Riiiighttt

There will never be another red day. Prices will keep going up but our wages won't. Put everything you own into SPY or be poor from inflation.
If you look at the spy monthly chart. It's almost as if September didn't even happen. The recovery has been so good, that it has returned to the previous slope.
Sept/Oct pullbacks allow us to get good positions while we wait for Santa.  Santa is spelled "Jpow" now.
No it hasn't and you can't even see the previous slope on the monthly chart

question: how do you define maximum employment 

jpow: we can‚Äôt calculate it. We don‚Äôt know that number and it‚Äôs changing so it really depends on how many weekly calls I bought
Taper has been priced in for weeks, yet WSB response is the glib remark 'It'S PrIcEd In!!'  and then goes and buys SPY puts.  lol,  so obvious you needed to invert WSB.
Legit question - can someone please explain to me why the markets are reacting positively to Powell's statements on the taper? Is it the news on interest rates not moving? It's a nice surprise to see the market still running, but I'd like to understand why.
He said business as usual. The "taper" actually means 105 billion of stimulus this month. And no intrest rate changes.
Dont ask questions enjoy the free money
Because the market is detached from reality
Damn whatever I buy turns red immediately

Well, boys, I‚Äôve loaded the boat with a literal shitload of calls in spy and sq at varying strikes and expiry dates. Time for rope or lambo.
Y'all already know JPow has loaded his Aston Martin to the brim with SPY calls. He'll slowly lower his mouth to the mic and sensually whisper "money", instantly doubling their value.
Gonna take a quick nap. When I come back, SPY better be -7%
-70*

What happened to ATVI? Did they announced that Bill Cosby will be in charge of HR or what?
Announced delays on some big game releases I think.
Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 delayed, co-leader leaves, q4 falls short of expectations
Game delays and analyst downgrades, weak q4 forecast
Blizzard is shitting the bed. WoW Sucks + game delays. Other IP delays. BlizzCon canceled. Don't respect players.
Game delays and 18/33 of the analysts covering them slashed their price targets, some as low at $65.
Glad GME gave people the opportunity to hold 250$ bags again
$287.80 here
It's how you get diamond hand apes. Harder to sell when in the red lol

The market has reached a point where it won't be stopped by anything less than a catastrophe of some kind
Wrong, a catastrophe will only solidify its rocketness and bring it more vertical.  Stop using logic, it doesnt exist any more.

Catastrophe = more printing = bullish.
And we seen what happens then. A year later it's like it never fucking happened.

I am all in for TSMC, i think they are the number one in chip industry and that share price should easily come to around 200$ soon
Its not at 200 because people think China will invade
But they are constructing right now a huge manufacturing place (100 billion $) in the USA as well
I‚Äôm hoping it sinks to 108 then I‚Äôm in
Lol cvs beat estimates by a fair margin and raises guidance so of course it's just gunna go sideways. Fml.
Was tempted to buy some lotto calls yesterday but it seemed too boomerish to move quickly. Will continue yolo‚Äôing in to much more useless companies
Yea I figure maybe the beat justifies the run-up its had this month and not much more. Idk, the 10k filing looked pretty good so maybe it'll move on the call unless the slides are already released then rip my options.
Huge float. Hard to move.
And here we are, moving pretty good actually.

They option chain hasn‚Äôt updated since it mooned after market close. So all the calls are cheap because they were way OTM and the puts were all ITM

I suspect people are getting pissy with the CEO, but Disney has shown the supply chain hitting the rest of the market doesnt affect them, as there‚Äôs always cheap crap from China you can buy with the Mouse on it

Rip
These CRSR bags have been heavy too long
Is it just me or is cnbc downplaying the Fed announcement today?
Pump up the volume.
Is it.... is it meme szn?
Doubling down on TSLA calls so far was not the best financial decision I‚Äôve make.
OCGN discount atm nomnomnom
RIP Zillow
Selling naked calls sound so tempting
Someone in here yday said the $210 call was free money and I should‚Äôve listened :( shits up 10x now

In retrospect PYPL puts was the play for the last 2 weeks. Not calls or shares.
I had/have FIGS calls and GME calls, so today is pretty fucking fantastic.
Mj sector pumping üöÄ
Being right is way better than sex
Bull trap at open. Careful.
Garbage boomer stocks... Energy is getting more expensive by the second, XOM beats earnings by a mile, and yet is still down. Time to FOMO into TSLA options again.

Hmm TSLA FD‚Äôs?
PYPL is such a troll. Exactly what is the news that makes it go downer and downer everyday
remember dude, people like to buy stocks at all time highs and sell stocks when they have 11 red days in a row, just do the opposite you‚Äôll be rich soon üëçüèº
Downer
I'm still in junior high but my dad gave me $2 million to learn stocks with

Do you mean 464?
Yes. Fat fingered.
Indeed he does.

wtf
What u playing
Tell me why I shouldn‚Äôt buy Disney calls
Because they are completely upside down on Disney +, inflation is spinning wildly out of control and nobody will be able to afford to go to a Disney park...
It's the only red ticker in a sea of green
So it's on sale?
Well yes I bought calls this morning but I took a small position
Been watching too. Not sure
Cause it just broke the bottom of the channel.
Nov 12 the Disney+ day. Last year that shit had calls up 900-1200%
When do UPST calls make sense? Like 350c or 360c. It swings wildly these days and earnings are next week
They don't make sense. Puts do though.
Z.. no.. lol
 When do we find out about FOMC stuff?
2pm
is that when the Fed meeting is
That‚Äôs when minutes are.
Aapl just needs to break 151 then it‚Äôs all time highs
Grabbed WISH $5 puts .10
I heard there is a good interview with Yellen on that new AAPL tv Jon Stewart show. Anyone see it?

Yes, better interview with Jamie Dimon on the podcast
Everything in my portfolio is mooning -- my unintelligible portfolio of Grocery Outlet, Redbox, Chegg, and three 3D printer companies.
Soon may the tendie man come
CCJ quietly handing out 10 baggers this morning.
Why didn't it do that when I had calls on it 2 months ago
Think it keeps going? Looking at $30C
Personally I wouldn‚Äôt play it weekly but if you can afford to buy more time or even LEAPS I think uranium is a solid play.
11/12 $30C is what I‚Äôm eyeing. I know nothing about the stock but you turned my attention to it
Current price is an ATH so you‚Äôre banking on another 10+% from there. I‚Äôm a gambler but I wouldn‚Äôt make that bet.
It's a solid company . Planeed to buy but didn't execute my plan
Why do I feel like I should always inverse myself. And why do I always lose. No matter what. Even if I inverse myself.
Dont even need a 10x er or whatever. Im just happy stocks are paying my rent again this month ü•≥
Not financial advice, but buy VSTO before earnings.  This baby‚Äôs about to pop to 50 very soon.
Intc moving finally and it's actually making my balls tingle

What exactly will their statement do to the stock market?
Spy -70% in 10 minutes
a literal impossibility
If he uses the "T" word with confidence buls r fuk
oh definitely will go up or down, possibly sideways, but the lines will continue to move to the right regardless
Lmao thanks. I was meaning making it rapidly drop or rise. I appreciate the who fucking knows...lol
Make it move rapidly in some direction
Trash it
Good man, thanks
SPY sitting at the peak of the highest nose bleeding precipice as far as the mind can fathom, waiting for permission to keep going higher.
  
If there's an instance of consideration for future anything left in this market, it's got to come down with the announcement of any amount of taper.

Nah, if you want exposure to space, go with Rocketlab. At least they dont have a history of being pumped and dumped by chamath
Noted, will check them out
Look at ndq instead, it's virgin orbit, it's the profitable part of spce off that Branson spun off into a separate company

Can't decide whether to go calls or puts on ABNB. On the one hand, prices are higher than ever and more people are traveling. On the other hand, r/ABNB shows that the app is being used by homeless people to squat in random homes for months, which the cops apparently can do nothing about. Lmao what a shit business. I guess that's my answer
I went in calls, all the hotel brands posted much higher profits abnb should too
Are we resuming the memeening after the 2:00?

Usually tell myself to stop being a bitch, sadly not many other options as a man
from one man to another. i needed that üôèüèΩ glookin out
Wait. Emotions pass and you'll feel better again. Don't trade when you aren't in a good mental state.
Research PC parts and look for second hand component deals to flip or use in a build to resell, do a lot of gardening and walking through state parks, do some writing, read books about bee keeping so when I own some land I can build up and maintain a healthy colony. Anything that sets me up for a project I actually immediately care about tends to make it easier for me to avoid ruminating.
turn the phone off for a bit and do something else, go for a walk, cook something comforting, meet up with friends if possible, listen to music, play music, there are lots of options it's just hard to get the energy to do one when you're feeling down.
lmk if you find out

AMD about to bust through 130

edit: I'm up 150% on 130C expiring Friday Most people would sell because of the fed announcement but I know JPOW doesn't give a fuck about rate hikes or any of that üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª shit
In the words of the best trader of our time, mr shia labeouf ‚Äújust do it‚Äù
In all seriousness shit posting aside these Z and ATVI dips are free money.
No, Z got exposed
Nah they still have value and will focus on their core business now which actually makes money
Idk if Z is quite there yet, I‚Äôm hoping for mid 50s

But yeah, rebound is all but certain, don‚Äôt think it will be in the next quarter tho
That‚Äôs a steep drop bro. You may never get that chance. I say 65 and below it‚Äôs a buy. Well I don‚Äôt buy anything, I just fade the dip by selling puts.
Idk if Z is quite there yet, I‚Äôm hoping for mid 50s

Amd 140 next week :)
This only hapens if po0pPowell gives us good news today
The market not dumping before JPow speaking to trap üåàüêª then moon afterwards has me nervous.  Do we have the Gains Goblin Jerome today that's going to say something to flash crash us?
We‚Äôve flash crashed for a day every fed meeting this year
No we dumped all day before Jerome speaks then we pumped back afterwards.  I'm talking a flash crash like he caused in  October 2018 where we drilled to the center of the earth.
Yeah I'm standing ready to buy the dip this time.
CAR deserves to be at sub 200

Look whos right
Was on leave with pain pills after surgery this week.  Now i understand all the addiction talk.  It feels like youre in heaven when you take them.
Yeah bro be careful was addicted for 3 years and getting them from the doctor is how a lot of people start. Trust me don‚Äôt take that path it fucking sucks
Ye i wouldnt know how to keep getting them but i hear you.  Dumped them out on my desk and counted how many i had left last night.  Never done that before with any other pill.  They just feel so good damn.
Yeah I think doctors are fucked for starting people even on 5 mg percs with the Tylenol in them even those can start your addiction pretty quick I think they should always start with naproxen and then go to tramadol if they have too because they get so many people addicted when they give you the week supply for your pain after they are gone you just want more. Fucked my life completely withdraws feel like your dying and you‚Äôll just be broke every single week. Give yourself like 2-3 days after youll take your last one and you‚Äôll feel normal it only take about a week sometimes a couple days for people to get the mental addiction. That can even be as subtle as having thoughts like ‚Äúdamn wish I had more of those‚Äù stay safe brother. After they are gone it‚Äôs fuck those pills
Yeah thanks for the heads up.  Definitely feel how easy it is to get hooked but ill steer clear when these are out.
Yessir hope you get back to feeling 100% ü¶æ
Appreciate
I bought CAR puts at 480, it has dropped almost 50% to below 300 and somehow my puts havent moved at all. Can someone explain this

Lol volatility bro
Shoulda shorted the stock. IV was hella high
Fuck, all I got left is 1 ply toilet paper.

Calls on Costco.
If I had sold my Tesla call this morning, I would have had the $ to buy 2 on this dip. Darn
Right fuckin bullshit I'm sick of life
Theory: Tesla will dance around 1200 -1100 until December which you will see 1500+
Interesting that Zillow spiked so much before the gouging.

Seems nefarious.
Happens all the time. Top blows off and then tanks.
****looks at market nervously****
That's why I'm holding some puts.
Taking profits from the puts on bbby I don't trust this shit it's getting too slow lol
They are no tapering the dems migth as well say we will lose next election sorry
When is CAR going back to 560
Never lol

When they order 100k Tesla's.
I know stonks are disconnected from all fundamentals but this ‚Äúeasing‚Äù will be interesting to see how and if it will even effect this market.
hope earnings can give DKNG a kick in the ass. was cruising nicely until that attempted acquisition fucked everything up
Gambling definitely isn't going out of style
for sure. I think the big question is how much they‚Äôre spending trying to buy market share and if it‚Äôs paying off

my calls would enjoy that.
Spy 2dte's at 2:30pm got it üìù
Like I don't know if it's some algorithm, a professional trader doing weird spreads, or some stupid retail investor but the market has apparently decided that the fact that AMC just went down from $42 to $40 in half an hour means that there is now a *lower* chance that AMC would get down to $33 per share by November 19th. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Like I sold the put instead of buying it so I'm not complaining, but it still feels a bit hilarious to see a put go down from IV crush as the underlying falls.
IV crush is more powerful than Delta, in fact, IV crush might be the most powerful force in the known universe
It‚Äôs the pricing mechanism. MM price gouge option buyers at times of peak interest. Then IV drops to normal

Everyone talking about tapering what's happening with infrastructure bills
It was gutted
Lol tsla. Just what?
ATVI is my white whale
More like black swan
someone here was saying that the options chain pricing looks like the market isn't expecting a large move for a long time. I call bullshit and bought a bunch of Jan 22 72.5C
Yeah I doubled down today
Need TSLA to hit ATH again so I can open another spread
Which one of you cheese dicks told me it would be January all over again?
MSFT bby 335 was looking like your number today

Holy fk, bought 100 ü•≠ on the dip today, sold a CC on the rip and overall up, those options are so volatile lol thanks for buying my call which is up 50% now

I know I keep saying it. Z PUTS. Get in on it. This company is fuk. Up 145% and its not even in to 50s yet.
I just feel like CLOV is going to break soon.

Almost bought my first TSLA call at the very bottom today. Lmao I‚Äôm a bitch tho
Can RKT hit 19 by end of next week??
Everything is still, and quiet. I'm scared
Both CRSR and TLRY are up, and WISH was up at one point, and everyone is still asking what's wrong today lmao. Everything is fuk
My options lookin' dirtier than Kyler Quinn's pussy
I did not think I‚Äôd end up in the red until tomorrow. Guh
Thoughts on buying a LEAPS on ATVI right now?
I did it
Today's an overreaction. CoD release later this week. People freaking out about D2 and OW2 delays but those aren't even the biggest money makers. Revenue still on the rise; long term outlook solid
Threw a bit for 7 Jan $70 calls. We‚Äôll see what happens
Wouldn't touch it at all. Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 delayed. They're not even doing work at that shit company.
Time to get fucked by RKT again!
RKT move your ass to $20
It‚Äôs so annoying when RH has bad option prices in for contracts that aren‚Äôt as liquid. I just want to admire my tendies and RH is showing a loss
Nothing worse than opening the Yahoo finance app and seeing your portfolio go red.
This comment would also work well if truncated just to include the first clause
Why do you need to use Yahoo app to see your portfolio balance?

I'm so interested to see how the FED plays this. They went into yesterday's meeting with three weeks of unbridled, ripping, RSI pegging, 7% index growth totally unchecked.
  
They've got to make some moves soon.
Alright, what‚Äôs the play. I‚Äôm bored
The market will crash when JPow speaks--- si o no?

My balls are feeling big holding through the meeting, but my brain is panicking
The only reason the fed even gives pressers is to calm you retards down, we all know what they are doing and everything is priced in.
It‚Äôs always old farts that sell gold coins on infomercials

For the next few weeks I'm going to be suffering: A few days ago I was going to buy 10k put contracts at near 0 cents for Zillow.  They are now trading at like $3.50.

Jacked to the tits in shares. Thank you for your service.
BBBY call credit spreads were actually free money after all. nice.
DKNG has become a boomer stock in terms of movement. Boring as fuck.
Friday all in.
Something something tools. Something something taper. Something something dovish. Something something transitory. Something something money.
PYPL is so close to this triple bottom
Weird volume for the SPY is only 14m usually at this time of the day it be around 23-25m
Yeah, everyone has been saying this. It's fed day, this will make or break spy, everyone is waiting
What the big deal? Fed going to either taper now or December and raise rate when taper is finish.
They've been easing the economic burden since the beginning of COVID, our whole economy is in a bubble and it's going to pop eventually, the entire tech sector Is overbought and buyer sentiment is out of wack with buying and holding strategies on indexes for retirement plans has set this tapering up to crash the market, pair that with inflation 3x the target and we'll see one of the biggest capital retraction from the market into high interest rate bonds once tapering starts, this is all my own thoughts and DD but If tapering is even kind of not priced in I see a big drop in SPY, so everyone is waiting to see if they can pull there positions slowly over the next month or rug pull today. Again, all my own research
Bleh any rug pull is already been cushion by the massive run up we have last month.
Realistically if a rug pull happens it could take us back to sub 400, maybe even mid 300's, tapering will mark the end of the most liberal use of quantitative easing the US has ever seen and ironically could recreat the 1920's financial crisis in the 2020's
I guess we have to wait and see how the market react
Haha I got screwed on my puts but my calls are starting to print, gotta love this delusion
I think we gonna bounce  from 2 to 2.30 and then jpow tanks it
I can feel a bird second pop here

Wtf?! Just realized the IV of the 530C 1/21/2022 (12%) is about the same IV as the 470C 1/21/2022 and the 470C is way fucking closer to the money

What‚Äôs that telling you boys?!
I DONT KNOW

TELL ME
530C will fucking PRINT
I dont know, what IS IT telling us?
That you don't understand the black Scholes formula
Deep OTM IV should not be the same as way closer to the money
That SPY is fucky? I'll buy some 530s cause they're a penny.

I might have to actually pay taxes on my gains this year. What a thought
Roll those losses forward!
Same. I was in the hole for most of the year and now suddenly turning a profit. Not sure how I feel about it.
Haven‚Äôt seen green since may, went from -35% to 0% today, might need to turn things around before tax season
Yeah, I was down 60% at one point during that last dip we had, now up like 10% on the year. Better find something to yolo to get back to 0% before tax season.
Some nice gains, I am Working on moving 100% of my portfolio to December SPY 500 calls
Honestly thinking about doing the same so I don‚Äôt have to keep track of my shit day to day.
Short term spy calls are what made my account recover, turning to long calls to make my account prosper, almost 0 risk involved
You need to make a deposit now if you don't want to pay failure to deposit penalty and interest. 20% of your profit should be good enough if long term, about 30% short term.
uhh what? what‚Äôs this 20 profit you speak of
It‚Äôs only if the year before you had a windfall, the next year you have to pay quarterly taxes.  You‚Äôll want to lookup the rules for the specifics .
So if i‚Äôm still negative end of year, I won‚Äôt have to worry about this right?
> That is correct.
Depends on whether the gain/loss is realized or unrealized meaning whether you sold or not.
It is a theoretical concept for wsb members. In practice,, if you have gains, you ll have to pay tax. If you held for longer than a year, you pay long term capital gains tax assuming you are from the USA
This seems like a difficult concept to grasp, I‚Äôm new to this gains thing, I‚Äôll look more into this thanks
Are you talking about quarterly payments?
Yes

They are likely waiting for EV credit to go through before signing. This way they don‚Äôt risk not getting the credit in case last minute language changes ie ordered on or after Jan 1 vs delivered on or after Jan 1.

As a sign of good faith and show commitments they did the advertising campaign and press release which Elon supported and perhaps even deliberately doing the tweet a week later to keep hertz and Tesla in headlines.

Shameless copy from another commenter spreading awareness
Isnt the bill now supposedly in jeopardy since dems lost ground last night? Or is that just polititards wanting to feel important?

That's what this retarded market has become
Oh lawwwd GME $300 this week and I‚Äôll cum
It‚Äôll tickle $350 again and probably get smacked down‚Ä¶again. The sold a shitload of shorts around $350 before the buy button was turned off.
This week? Today!
In all seriousness, what is going on with $GME?  I bought in way too late this morning and am still up 6% in like 10 minutes!
ppl got bored of pumping tesla and the hype died so now they're pumping gme.
GME is going to the moon again nice
That was the fastest 5k I‚Äôve ever made off an option play. Thank you GME.
Point to the part where GME touched you for the apes that bought 250-300c

Anyone else in puts right now? Or is it too obvious. Is all this shit priced in. I‚Äôm losing my mind.
puts are the rational "call" but this market is not rational atm.
Ha right remember last year when they literally closed global commerce as we know it and the market had a face ripping rally lmao.
It‚Äôs priced in and you‚Äôll lose money. Personally, I enjoy losing money and currently holding puts that will probably expire worthless.

Are you Elizabeth Warren?
I don't think he's a dumbass, just corrupt. Consider if you will who gave him that job.  


Nothing about today has made me the slightest bit less bearish
You‚Äôre not wrong, yet you believe that this is a bearish sentiment. Everyone with a brain knows our institutions are compromised, but if they are corrupt, then why would there be an adverse reaction for the multinationals who rigged them to begin with? They‚Äôre just going to keep accelerating the income inequality and buying up all the assets on planet earth. That‚Äôs the point. Why would the market crash?
Lets be honest, its really a ploy to reduce labor costs in a way that most people don't understand.

# OH LOOK, MINIMUM WAGE IS NOW $15!!!!

I am upvoting everything. 

Take that!
Imagine wasting time looking into how messed up the American financial system is and wasting money on puts expecting everything to collapse when you can just buy calls and shit post instead
For real though... you'd think I would of learned my lesson by now...
Healthcare is on the verge of collapse and infrastructure is crumbling, but we literally gave away trillions to businesses and people that weren't even struggling just because someone got the sniffles.  No way we won't be suffering for generations.

Edit: autocorrect changed someone to Donnie, that's creepy
You bought puts didn't you lmaooooooooooo
No I got bailed out of some truly bad calls today.  There's never a time to buy puts lol.
Lol you're smart then, everything you said is true but it's not getting fixed as long as we have boomers in office. Best thing to do is cash in while you can

Flair his parents
I'm not a guy and taking out a loan to load up on Lucid stocks after it's run is stupid.
Most people who build wealth do so by beginning with debt. Taking out a loan and dumping it all into stock with interest rates as low as they are and stock valuations and inflation all ballooning, it‚Äôs a lot less stupid than it seems.
For sure there are good debts and bad debts and as much as I enjoy the bull run, it's not full proof. Every stock experience a pullback after a crazy run. It'll be unwise to fomo into a stock when it balloons with a loan before it even finds its floor.
The way I see it, there‚Äôs really no way to know what a floor would be with valuations this far away from any sort of fundamentals, and the longer you wait to jump onto the gravy train hoping for a golden opportunity where it makes sense to invest, the more likely you‚Äôre gonna miss it. People said for months that tesla 700 was ridiculous, that it had to correct, and its obviously not worth what it‚Äôs valued at, but still it has risen like crazy. If they believe in the company and are both in their prime earning years of like 40-50, then it‚Äôs a reasonable gamble. If they are yoloing it into options and just trying to make a quick buck, maybe less reasonable, although this market is stupid enough that it might be brilliant.
Tesla is unique in that its way ahead of other EVs in terms of battery, software and the experience it gives to their drivers. The self driving feature alone sets it apart to all the competition in the market and my parents aren't in their "prime earning years." My dad is sick and my mom sees this as a retirement ticket that'll materialize within the next year. Their expectations are unrealistic and with a strong pullback they could actually lose way more than they borrowed. I'm not that bullish on Lucid personally..
Well then yeah they might be stupid or desperate. I‚Äôm not in lucid or tesla. Sorry about your dad being sick, that‚Äôs unforunate.
It's just a bad situation and I appreciate you caring. :) I'm sure it'll mean a world to my dad strangers care about his health. I'm holding both but it's not life changing money. Thanks for your outlook and advice.
Dam, well now I feel bad bullying a girl‚Ä¶..

It‚Äôs not,,,,, chivary isn‚Äôt dead yet

some bullshit as usual
Managed to catch the exact top of GME 40 mins ago and my calls are down 67%.  Someone mod me
Learn the lesson and move on
I bought calls and opened spreads the whole way up. 230, 235, 240, 245. I was up about $800 with a few k in upside depending on share price Friday. Then I got greedy and bought a 250 call at $15.13.
I bought the same call for $9

Gotta eat a better breakfast. Otherwise it just goes right through me.
i don‚Äôt eat breakfast. maybe it‚Äôs that
Ya probably. Gotta get some food in there to absorb.
Not always but if my stomach is feeling upset *at all* coffee is an instant coup de grace
The opposite for me. I drink two cups black in the morning.
cigs for me. coffee too but not as instantaneous
back in my cig days, coffee and cig in the morning, yeah you‚Äôre emptying out
Nicotine and caffeine are diuretics
Plenty of people tried to warn you that OCGN approval was a sell the news event.
And yet here I am holding like a garden flag in a hurricane
I bought 1 share so I can say I helped. Sad I did. Ha
Big rip to all the ocgn bulls
Makes no sense, higher volume buys then sells yet the price keeps dropping.

But that one time that your SPY options hits 500% in a day. Keep chasing the dragon.
+500% 1 week. 

-98% all time
Just get better at the game. If you were going to play spy should've been before the announcement.
And i'm out. Sold the Z PUTS. 20k easy
you think it's gonna spike on the JPOW talk, or just taking gains you're happy with & playing it safe?

OCGN now at same price it was yesterday. This isn‚Äôt ‚Äòsell the news‚Äô. It‚Äôs gearing up for a big run. Consolidating and shorts pushing. I don‚Äôt think people realize how many aren‚Äôt vaccinated in poor countries that would use this vaccine. And the demand for it.
WHO approval is the pre-catalyst.  It gives confidence in the vaccine, and paves the way, but it will take Canada/USA approval for use and/or manufacturing deals to really push the stonk.
I think things will improve once Ocugen lays out the full plan to co-develop with Bahrat now that it's WHO approved.
Oh look, GME pumped and now it's dumping...again. But, it's not a p&d stock now tho, right?

Maybe this isn‚Äôt for you
I know what I'm doing.

I'll think I'll buy some OTM CAR weekly calls. To the moon!
NVAX can solve that for u!!!
Cmon Z go to 60
Tesla 1420.69
BBBY up 57% in premarket!

Who's with meeeee
I am!!!
It‚Äôs normal to jerk it to GME chart right?
> No.
Yes.  There are several subs dedicated to just that.
Sorry, too busy stroking it to the GME chart yo answer your question at the moment
GME firesale
Our JPow, who art in heaven,

Hallowed be thy name

Thy printer come

Thy will be done

On earth as it is in heaven

Give this day our daily tendies

And forgive us our margin calls

As we forgive those who sell us shit calls

And lead us not into inflation

But deliver us from evil

For thine is the Federal Reserve

The power and the glory

For ever and ever
poetic and religious
I swear this sub is full of idiots.

Like how do you buy GME/AMC after everything? Do you have common sense? Wtf?
A good part of this sub only buys after it‚Äôs runs up
i am autistic as shit
Dude hundreds of people were waiting for JFK jr to be like ‚Äúyo I didn‚Äôt actually die‚Äù yesterday

Ok hands up.... how many bulls wandered into that trap?
Bought calls at 1:59pm, sold at 2:01pm for a smooth 20% gain.
Well played..... gotta have your head on a swivel out here!
Maybe -- I'm nervous that I should've held a few in case it goes into full rally into EOD...but I'm gonna take it and be done for the day and just see what happens now...
Enter full rally mode‚Ä¶.
Fucking criminals

lol i bet you thought taperings was bearish. guess again you smelly ber.
Instead of student loan forgiveness how about telling universities to lower their fucking prices
Something JPow said, made the markets add 0.5 percent to SPY / VOO / Blackrock IVV.

Great!   I wish he would say that every day!   1.005^(365) = 6.175, and who doesn't want a safe six-bagger!??
saying it on the weekends doesn't count, double check your math there
1.005^(365*5/7) = 3.67, still pretty good.
SPY 500 by end of year is in play.

Only 7.5% away... any other year that would be 10 months of gains but with how bullish markets are right now?  It could happen...
Why am I awake at this god forsaken hour?
Meth?
Adderall, but close enough
Just bought my all time first Calls (Tesla)... I have two questions:
1* what are those? 
2* I'm gonna be rich? 
3* I'm retarded enough to be here?
You gonna be a broke retard.
Still can sell my Asshole for money :/
Then you will get double fucked
This is when we buy puts.
bit late to buy tesla , wait for pull back to 1000 to buy
Fuck late
But Tesla to 10k :)
That trash cunt will post something on twitter and fuck up everything

OCGN call?18or20
This shit is hitting 50 today üöÄüòéüò¨
Unless it‚Äôs halted
Are we finally breaking 1200?  Today?
Yes
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Here we go. Another green day on the books
You think tech will pump again?
Why do I have a feeling the market is going to absolutely dump today
Literally one of the strongest potential catalysts for a dump is happening today. It‚Äôs not like a wild assumption. Shits a coin toss.
People sure don‚Äôt seem worried about the Fed
Vix certainly doesn‚Äôt give a fuck
Thanks for picking me up at GME 220! Let‚Äôs ride to the moon boyz üöÄ
Tesla 1270 EOD
Buy the rumor, buy the news.
Sell the dip
$BB hit 12 game over see you on mars
GME volume isn‚Äôt even very high, if volume reached levels like January it could literally hit 500 I think

Correction: 1000 easy
if it ever break 350. its unknown territory, everything is possible.
Great point, kinda like Tesla this past week
add some  zeros to the 500 bro
Lol you might be right, this volume is like not even 5% of what January volume was
HOLY MOLY GME
Very suspicious GME hasn‚Äôt had a massive red dildo yet by 10am . It‚Äôs usually a guarantee
This not an usual day
GME GAMMA RAMP!
Meme stocks back on the menu. AMC GME
467 bag holders we are coming for you #gme
is that you god....?
GME over 235 now moon shot?
Might run to 300+ today tbh
Holy shit GME above $250 LOL. 

$350 by EOW?
anybody know the level of gme stock need to reach to see old hedge fund boomer crying on tv again? bitching that gme breaks market
$500 plus 30% from FAANG collateral says roughly $650?
AMC is skyrocketing.
i see amc is pumping again
how tf did you guys all know to buy gme today?
People have been spamming GME everyday for the past year
ive been holding since 2020 bro wym
They buy fractional shares of GME every day, they just only talk about it when it goes up
i guess it only takes one day for it to blow up
A broken clock is right twice a day
it was popping

when she runs she rips
It's a meme stock whose price rose $15 yesterday. Lots of people bought at the top thinking the momentum would continue and it did.
Did that dude who was short GME and AMC exit his position? If not I want to see some losses
I never had positions dumbass

I just like throwing peanuts at dumb apes to piss you off. Thanks for making these calls print though
"I was just pretending to be retarded"
The entire time? Quite the long con
It wasn‚Äôt you anyway cuck
Friendly reminder to cancel your $250 GME sell orders
Maybe next year lolololol
OCGN leg back up to $17 in 3‚Ä¶. 2‚Ä¶1.
Weird big red candle on approval news.. like some big hedge was reconfiguring their options for skyrocket...

It‚Äôs called negative beta ü§°
Ok who of you fucks bougth at 250 come on now pants down
I bought at 253 ü§°
I bought qqq at $108
Got some gme 300 calls for Friday ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Had a serious talk with my wife last night. I laid it all out there. My son is one year old, but told my wife that if I ever catch him later on playing or even thinking about playing with WISH, I will kick him out of our house. She laughed and said it was funny that I thought WISH would still he around long enough for that to happen. Anyhow, BB go to moon.
what happened to ocgn :(
it was a pump and dump, nothing that was happening in terms of WHO news wasn't already priced in.
People sold the news already
Gme round 2 begin!
Round 2? I thought we were at like round 4 by now
Tsla is done for now
Lucid takes over üöÄ
Tsla officially topped down hill from here it‚Äôs seeming
Thanks Elon üòÇüòÇ
HOOD back to 40. They will announce the Shanaya Buba coin
OCGN dry fucked me hard. My ass is still bleeding.
You see the chart yesterday? Same thing today possibly.
I don't even know why I hold GME anymore man, it's just funny to me now
I do in the off chance it des MAOSS I can say I was there
5.50 to 469.00 was the moass, you were already there ü§ó
That is the fun part we don't know for sure
Spy puts because he‚Äôs going to say taper today?
Everyone thinking the same so prob not
Rippp. Lmao
Sooo many 50% huge movers today... i barely made 500$ lol. I wanna get a 1000% call so bad ahhh
Today is the biggest bull trap, went from up $5k at 10am to down $500 now
Gme?
A bit of GME and CLOV shares, but mostly QS, PLUG and FCEL calls. Looked good this morning but have been tanking since. They‚Äôll continue their run these coming weeks though, we need a  healthy correction anyways
OCGN needs some serious TSLA energy
That stock is dog shit. Always sell the news event.
It has more potential than MRNA but idk if it has the same popularity

More products more sales and higher efficacy and immunocompromised can take it. Maybe becuz it is coming after MRNA it has less excitement
Umm no.  MRNA has real technology and will cure several diseases in the next 10 years.  No comparison.  OCGN was a good buy tho
we all know gme going to back to 250 today lmao.
[deleted]
Except for today 255
Why would you even sell TSLA shares right now. The board meets next week. Last time they did a split they announced it on Aug 11, right after the board met. Might get the announcement as early as this month.
I know right. I don't get it either. You see the posts of people that have held on to it a long time and how much money they've made and then these people are buying and selling them for a $10 gain and some selling at a loss of they had a stop loss order on. Makes no sense. Just buy and hold
GME AH go boom
üåõüîú
Bigly
jpow better start up those printers
Why are you people so fixated on OCGN, there are other biotech plays out there
OCGN? What the fuck is even happening today why are you playing with me like this
The previous 6 times it did this didn‚Äôt give you any clue this would happen again?
First time buying and hearing about it actually, and i went full retard 1k+ shares
This. 1000000000x this
Anyone else eyeing Zillow?
Catching the falling knife‚Ä¶ ahhh a classic ü§å
when was the last time you posted or used zillow or bought anything from them
Never in my life personally. My parents used them back in 2006 to buy a house. They then used them once more to sell that house before they built a new one. These trading multiples have been ridiculous for multiple companies like Zillow which have no real growth opportunities. They will always be niche with minimal ways to expand profit. This home flipping business was their best bet to get out of that and they fumbled it
I bought a shit ton of vix calls. That means there won't be a sell off. You're all welcome.
SPY gonna brrr soon. I know it cause I saw rocket emojis, a moon, and a money printer in my dream last night
That's cause the moon was behind the rocket where it was headed back towards the money printers on Earth. üìâ
how the fuck is this good news?
Come on OCGN how long we have to hold until you moon?
Buy and hold üçª
I have 1000 now ., I wish I had more money üòù
Nice! Then hold üòÅ

Fuck. Tsla puts were a terrible idea
Only thing saving them is the IV rising like crazy right now. At least the ones for a few weeks out. Took a hit but creeping back up even as it sits at 1200
What's that market wide pump? Was it jpow?

Wonder how many people have said this in the last year
never buy puts on stocks with retard strength
actually just never buy puts. bad idea

Yeah. Just had to time the market with money we don't have to afford couple of Teslas.

What about the squeeze? None of them even know what it means.

fuck i shouldn‚Äôt have invested in a video game company that consistently makes money

should‚Äôve invested in a failing brick n mortar video game store saved by memes instead
It‚Äôs not failing if it‚Äôs up 40x in 12 months .

Nothing else matters but the price people are willing to pay in this market
it‚Äôs been saved by memes which is what i said didn‚Äôt i?
Good time to add more in my opinion. I might hop into a long position at this discount.

Nah, you'll be hella sad if it pumps and those calls go up to like 70k....happened to me the first time around...then I FOMOd and made a million
Yea there was a lot of money to be made just then. I made $200 then sold and bought another call option then lost that $200.

JPOW is totally off the mark on thinking COVID is the reason for lack of employment.

McDonald‚Äôs, along with a lot of other fast food restaurants, began their shift from the Dollar Men√º to the their ‚Äúgourmet‚Äù Men√º. They said their dollar Men√º was losing profit and most people were spending less due to things simply being 1$. So they made ‚Äògourmet‚Äô foods to force you to spend more money.

I‚Äôm thinking of taking 8k out of the market next year and take a 2 month mental summer break next year.
yeah 8k seems like a solid amount. I sell CSPs on GME and that covers my rent. so i'd probably only take like 5k out I think.

Puts on zillow

Edit: the housing market has jumped the shark and zillow got caught with its pants down. They are exiting the house flipping business and laying off 25% of workforce. I think it will hit $30 before its done.
What gave it away?
I woke up and notice joe biden was president.
Holy shit, how did you come up with that deep analysis?
Just intelligent like that.  It seems really obvious, but it seems like its still a good bet even though i felt like i got in kind of late on the trade.  I would do it again. Im holding ten january 2021 puts with a $40 strike.
Did you just wake up and read the news lol? This was known yesterday
I was watching economic ninja on youtube. I was a little drunk on tsla success and hopeful for my new investment in dwac.  I averaged down on paypal.  And then i saw that zillow was still a long way from its covid bottom and figured what the hell. Might as well ride the coattails of the great examples.  I sold some sens calls to get the cash to buy the z puts.  Slow on the uptake, yes. Every once in awhile a blind dog finds a bone.

I'm going cash with my < 60 day to expirations and taking the profits

no, I've got a SPY straddle on but heavier on the put side
Yeah, and I'm still down nearly 50% on them.

Demand through the roof. Supply chain in shambles and can‚Äôt catch up. Only going to get worse if Powell doesn‚Äôt turn the printers off and raise interest rates



It would get worse if he does that lol. US gov needs to print or debt costs as % will stay where they are / lower slowly. 


Print, and debt costs as % will lower faster. Better.
We‚Äôre gonna go way up, way down, or way flat. The anticipation is the only thing that makes me feel alive.

SPY you slut
This market is so eager just like this dude‚Äôs mouth
okay this one is kinda funny.
Pretty sure anyone who bought a home in the last 18 months is going to be underwater in the next 6
Please explain your theory...
zillow went bust flipping homes. Maybe the home market is not going up forever after all.
?? hyper inflated prices from covid, rising interest rates, zillow dumping thousands of homes, evergrande having to sell off assets to avoid default. This has been obvious for some time, what do you not understand
Home buyer in the last 18 months spotted
Nope.
Zillow, and others (BlackRock) rushed in and starting buying homes at whatever price. They intended to flip them to families fleeing cities because of Covid. However, they overpaid thinking they could pass the cost on to consumers. Consumers balked at the prices and now Zillow has inventory it can‚Äôt sell. The cure for higher prices are higher prices. Homes are becoming illiquid in the sense no one can afford to buy at these prices
Home prices (around here) have been going up for years. If you think we will have an 08 on your hand. There is a lot of differences. No one is doing 'NINJA' loans, people are putting real money down, inflation is a thing including rising wages. I could actually afford a home now due to my massive raise.
Congrats on raise. I didn‚Äôt say 2008 bubble pop, but home values are going down. The prices of homes have priced too many buyers out of the market, creating an illiquid home buying market. Zillow has 7k homes they can‚Äôt sell. NINJA loans aren‚Äôt a factor and mortgage applications showed healthy credit scores in the last 18 months.

Mortgage rates are also on the rise. No one will sell their existing home for a bigger one if they have to pay a higher mortgage rate. Homes are at ATH and finding a lack of buyers
I'll say that the 10%+ y/y might be gone going forward. But they will rise at 2-3% overall. There might be some pockets still mega hot that will get +5 or some cold ones that will be - 5.
It will be interesting to see it play out. I still stand by my statement that many have been priced out of the housing market. I don‚Äôt think the Zillow issue is over. This spells trouble that they have 7k homes they can‚Äôt sell and are going to lose money on
Thanks for your analysis
Ya if you overpaid for one, plus interest rates going up over next couple years will even it out a bit
> The current interest rates are actually very low. The average rate is around 3%. It was over 5% in the past few years.
You get a house soon stay after it
Everyone thought that there was a housing bubble that was going to pop around 2018-2019. If you're renting you're literally throwing money away, might as well buy in case it isn't actually a bubble
I never thought that. I thought houses were fairly valued.   I still see a bigger bubble in stocks than homes
Obviously not literally everyone thought that, but it was being discussed on financial media (e.g., CNBC). I waited for that bubble to pop before buying. Obviously it never popped so I should have bought sooner.
So WHO approval for covaxin $ocgn
I hope they approve it
They did lol

Anyone playing today's earnings? EYSY, ROKU, etc..
Play the fed news instead , dip incoming after institutional  algo response like clockwork everytime
SPY puts, then calls after a we go below 450?
 not going below 450.
I'm banking on cvs making a big move up, or a big move down. Frankly I don't care which way it goes just so long as it does it bigly.
straddle?
More or less, 92c, 84p. Really the puts are more a hedge than expecting it to go down significantly. 5% move either direction, up hopefully with pediatric covid vaccinations starting this weekend, and I can at least unfuck my tsla spread loses.
ROKU make me broku. I‚Äôve got calls

Excellent, and here I thought for a second there was some sort of value in any this, which of course would directly oppose my investment strategy, so I guess I'm all in (nothing worse than having enough money to eat the next day and being burden with the decision of what to eat).

What possible reason did you have to think it would go up?
Strong earnings and the company is actually a very strong company with a lot of growth potential. The only reason it has tanked is because of the game delays.
Also people fleeing their products and ongoing litigation. All of the news on them is negitive. They struggle to recycle their most popular games into successful products.

I did my first ever CC on ASTS 12.50.... of course it reaches it
ASTS just has so much potential and hasn‚Äôt even squeezed before it just keeps slipping upwards
I'll probably buy back in even if I'm assigned.

There will be one guaranteed, eventually!

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/fatnigmongolfagotcuz (0/1) made a bet that BABA would go to 150.0 when it was 175.06 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
What a name
what a dummy too (betting against BABA at these prices)
I did well for months betting against baba. I wouldn't touch it right now though.
you were a brave one. I wouldn't guessed it myself being a BABA bull, you did well  though finding the right timing, gj

Same here, thinking either puts or calls for SPY, 0dte, after the fed meeting
When is this meeting
In 15 mins. Jpow speaks in about 45
MSFT barely atm eow. it will fly
335 call for Friday? Or closer
I have a few 335s for this Friday and next. not financial advice but think its a good move
If the fed meeting goes to shit will spy drag Microsoft down with it? What makes you think Microsoft will go up past it‚Äôs ATH this week?
Basically just betting the fed meeting won't go as poorly as people are thinking and we'll have big green days to finish the week. Tapering is priced in and this seems to be FUD to shake retail out
I‚Äôll buy a couple 335‚Äôs and maybe some spy calls for Friday before the speech
Sounds logical, best of luck to you!
TSLA is the winner

ppl buying the ATVI dip needs to realize that at the very least, options market aint pricing this to move very much in the next few years.

yeah analysts could be wrong with their model and blizzard will turn it around and delivery overwatch 2, diablo, and activison will stop sucking ballz

but Jan 2024 $70c is only going for around $10 - which seems cheap, until you realize that's two fucking years and the option market only thinks the underlying will grow 18%

that's terrible for a stock in this specific sector.

if you're buying near term calls for a technical bounce etc then wait till IV settles imo but that's just me

tapering as market knew about incoming tapering for many weeks now.
It's not the event, it's the *scale*. Canada didn't taper, they just killed QE in a single suprise blow. If the taper is anything but mild the market will react as if JPow animorphed into a hawk right on stage.

I think B&M retail is stupid cheap; they'll have a ton of pricing power going into xmas. A lot of them were dragged down with the crappy BBBY earnings report even though they're all not directly comparable.

Something like SFIX has to get past people wanting to see and try clothes on before they buy them. I could see a B&M retailer acquiring them.
Sounds good, I'll look into that

Is being up 19% YTD on 401k good? Up 38% over past 1 year. Should it be more aggressive even if it‚Äôs somewhat close to matching S&P500 returns?
Leave your 401k alone - make risky plays in a brokerage account.
Company matched and managed 401ks are the most boomer ass shit ever that it makes the s&p look high risk. Good returns.
I‚Äôm up 48% in my Roth IRA last 12 months. I have 98% diversified across dividends, VGT, VOO, and a few other safe stocks. 2% is for risky plays occasionally and I bagged 2k from OCGN before it dumped :)
Nice! I just opened Roth a few months ago, a lot more aggressive than my 401k, but with no individual stocks. Hoping to see gains like that in my future

Yes, it will still affect prices even if it‚Äôs itm
Yes almost always, unless the move is astronomical but if IV will still go down and your option value will be mostly intrinsic.
I mentioned a few weeks ago that I bought a ton (like a lot) of a couple penny stocks. Not naming them, but fucking guitar lessons ftw. Idiotic success like this is why I switch between accountants - can't let them steal my big brain ideas.

‚ÄúInflation largely transitory but still reduction by $15B in bond purchases starting Nov‚Äù
wait so the fed is increasing treasury purchases and that's bullish? isn't that basically saying they are anticipating an economic downturn and will allocate capital to safer investments?

Minutes are out though on the Fed website. No mention of tapering yet
Going all in 500c for Dec, this investing shit is actually easy AF

Good rationale. Takes my greed completely out of it. Trying to help the world over here!

Fucking Fed.  From inflation is trANsItORy to actually we like it, and now want it high for a long time so that everyone fucking knows we like it and expectations are anchored there.
Absolute morons. I've been saying the whole time it's not transitory. These cucks will destroy our economy
They don't care, they'll let inflation completely ass rape the poor and average American.

Holding calls but man the Fed is either retarded or too scared to say anything about inflation being long lasting.
Do I pull the trigger on V? Y/N
M
Which way? Calls or puts?
Do wet
literally no sign it's turning around so no
Wait until 205 but if you're impatient, go for it.
Why 205? Lol
decent support around 204-205, doesn't mean it'll drop down there though so if you don't want to miss out on a possible run, buy now
F to 18.60 end of day
Ouch, my balls
FSLY put IV is at 110%. how fucked would I be if the stock doesn't go down a lot on earnings.
bigly fucked
You'll probably be fucked even if it does go down
yeah the risk isn't worth it. gonna sell them now I guess.
Depends on the average IV of those contracts. Looks at contracts for next week, what's their IV? Doesn't need to make a huge move, 2 percent would hold value
the 110% IV are for puts expiring november 19th. the ones expiring this week are at 220% lol
I have puts 50 strike that‚Äôs not terrible IV. Crush happens when it‚Äôs in the 200s or more and then flat
Some MM probably hit the buy button instead of sell.
There you have it boys.  Inflation is here to stay, because now we're "anchoring" expectations.  Inflation is wonderful so since it was below 2% for so long, having it above is how you average it nicely.

It was spy smashing through ATH by 50c in 5 seconds for me
What's going to happen when they figure out how to collect back taxes on "corn?"
People will just say no and that‚Äôll be the end of it.
I'm not so sure.  I think they're going to start popping people soon.

Not a good time to hold companies that have very high P/E ratios.
They seem to be getting punished very very badly for missing the mark.

Tesla's still cool, right?
Tesla defies all rules. Lol.

But in all seriousness, any bad news for Tesla and you can be looking at drops of epic proportions. But then again, it has meme power like no other stock. Not even GME

If I believe that Oil is going to be 125 bucks a barrel early 2022, what are the best plays out there to get rich off it??

I‚Äôm trying to figure that out myself
I'm exiting my futures near close. Spy will probably go down tomorrow, it's a bit high on this news I think. 2 months out still bullish, I'm holding my leaps.
Seems like a good call. Just exited my calls, still holding a put position expiring 11/12

This is the trick. Teach yourself that it's okay to miss out on more to secure the bag. Just close out of your position, take the ticker off your watch list, and find another play.
I can't argue with the results it is producing and there is always, always another play.

I missed out on another 50% with AMC this morning, but I'm pretty sure if I would have held, I'd be worse off right about now.

On the other hand AMD just keeps going up. Any thoughts on jumping back in on the same ticker?
Why half the sub haiting on GME like they didnt just show up here when it first started popping off in Jan
I love the movie Gremlins but I would vomit if I had to watch it a million times
I hate the apes.
Yep.  We should have had a backup plan.  Every sub needs a bugout plan for if/when their sub gets popular and overrun.
Does anyone know OCGN's safe word? Because I'm getting fucked way too hard right now.
same like wtf it opened around 17 holy shit
> I don't think he has one.
Have the Apes complained about ShOrT LadDeR aTtAckS yet today? Lol
does the pope protect bears who shit in the woods when a tree falls and no one is around to hear it?

Dude i known its no nut November but go take a cold shower
Cathie has some other baggage too tho
Having 10k shares of tsla makes a girl my type
Depends how "not my type" she is. I know my ex's inheritance is about 6+ mil, and her dad is already in his 70s. But no fucking way I'd date her again
Just marry her for a couple years. Easy money.
For a couple months yeah. Let her shower me with gifts and affection. Also, if she's not a looker, I bet she's a cooker.  Some of the least attractive women I've been with sure do know how to prepare a tasty meal.

FOMO is a hell of a drug
Went to a friends house, in his bathroom and there's like  toothbrushes everywhere. Must be like 4 or 5 there. I go back to him like man wtf? He's acting like its completely normal. Every single person in his house has their own toothbrush. Am I poor or wth?
Did he have a tv in his bathroom?
U r poor and creepy for checking ppl's toothbrushes
Does every person in your house not have their own toothbrush
I used to get my brother's hand me down toothbrush, so we each had our own.
Everytime Powell talks, the market dies. Don't get too excited

Free money hack for the striking Deere workers:

1) Take out puts every time the stock rallies on "tentative deal struck" news

2) Reject tentative deal with vote

3) stock crumbles - sell puts

4) rinse and repeat. never have to return to work again üòè
> You are a fucking idiot.
VisualMod is out of control. Must be puberty
Free money hack 

1. Buy SPY/QQQ calls every time it dips 5%
The trade better be worthwhile because That's not bargaining in good faith and will lead to ULP's
I think that‚Äôs illegal.
To anyone buying puts rn let me clarify this:

Fed sells at the top and SPY dips all the way to $427.

On Friday these abnormal buy orders I noticed (on no news)

2.49 mil buy order 12:20

2.84 mil buy order 3:50

1.04 mil buy order 4

Then yesterday afterhours noticed another 250k+ buy order
yeah, imagine not thinking this is priced in rn lol
Seriously, I've been constantly bombarded with "markets may tank because FMOC meeting this week" on CNBC. Basically CNBC's bull sign only second to this guy![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Just wanna inspire fear in retail so they can scoop more up for cheaper and sell to us again once the FOMO pumps start
Fucking called it
isn't my first rode lol
Tapering priced in

Inflation priced in

Global warming priced in

Aliens are real priced in
Knowing there is a bear right now crying and rage downvoting in here makes me feel warm inside. Post your loss porn you coward.
There is HEAVY downvoting going on right now.

I'm a üåà üêª and have to admit that conference was insanely bullish.

Is it absurd how little he gives af about inflation?  Yes.  But that's the public story, what the Fed does has nothing to do with "supply constraints."  Apparently stimulus doesn't actually create demand, who knew.
IS THERE NO ONE ELSE?!
Ugh they keep pushing back infrastructure

GME with the foreplay ;)
I bought one GME call and one OCGN put this morning, I‚Äôm up over $1000 already!
Oh Apes already took over this thread
What the fuck is going on with GME volume today
It‚Äôs pretty light volume honestly, only 2.5% of the volume we saw in January
Wow I‚Äôm up $890 on my GME calls do I sell I‚Äôll be marked as a pattern day trader though
Take money.

Either open a different account at brokerage or bend over backwards at your current one to lift the ptd.
Hold!!
Nope wait till tomorrow
People buying GME 300c at the peak....Theta Gang be like How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old apeman
Huh, GME didn't tank yet in the 30 minutes since I got a 11/5 call. It might actually hold this price
The spread on GME..
Crazy hunh?  I thought about getting a bear call spread but the difference between bid/ask is rediculous.
So it goes with GME spreads. I‚Äôve been wanting to trade them (bear and bull at various times over last few months) but the spread is often more than a dollar or two. Surprisingly, the spreads are much tighter on AMC. I pulled a quick 90% gain on a 40/45 spread overnight with virtually no liquidity issues
I made a ton on AMC spreads in July, but lost a ton on the same, end of August.  Net was +500 so I guess I can't complain.  But that's the price of playing the memes.
LCID $38C 11/12 will print
My 290c gme was up 100% just earlier. I didn‚Äôt have the balls to sell and be labeled a pdt. Now we slippin. Hoping we get some autist momentum later to save me xD
Look back at the chart, this Jawn never goes straight up smooth
welcome ocgn baghodlers !!!  Glad I dumped at 17
Long way down before I'm not in profit. Holding for the next milestone
It‚Äôs going up. I‚Äôm still holding
Glad i didn't fomo in last night before close
still hasnt come down past the pullback from yesterday morning. I think it looks healthy right now on the 1h, personally
I might get back in at 10.  This shit isnt running right.  If there were real excitement this shit would be at 20.  This is just another pump and dump
$SDC is flying today
This is just the engine check
Yessir. I‚Äôm ready for blast off tomorrow
I sold half my OCGN calls for a good profit, then bagheld the rest, breaking even. Can't believe I fell for it again. This stock is always a piece of shit
MM playing games. Best vaccine in the world it will not stay down long. SMH, you will be glad you held half.
Absolutely not the best vaccine in the world by a longshot lmfao
Sold my GME 11/5 calls at the top. Just picked up more 11/12 $250 calls
Wish I had sold higher. Dropped up about halfway down. Still made 300%. Waiting for a good sign it'll start up as gain before getting in on some 11/12c
Looks like support at 225
Smart - taps head
Tesla you can do better than this.  You‚Äôre screwing calls and puts
BBBY got room to run? Should I buy in?
i mean mite as well baghold another memestock
Can someone please answer this question about OCGN...

WTF?
I‚Äôll answer that with a question for you. Fill in the blank. 

Buy the rumor, sell the ______
Booze
Sure: OCGN
Sold my gme options this morning but I am getting severe fomo right now
Why? It‚Äôs consolidating. Highly doubt it‚Äôll make another break.
Cuz I like money and lack rational thought process? One mistake I catch myself making a lot is going back to my winners over and over until they turn into losers
I mean did you think it was going to make a break this morning? If not then what you think is irrelevant since you're just guessing.
It did make a break this morning... and yes I thought it would because it broke 218 resistance in AH last night.
What is you doing TSLA-bro?
Puts work
Wasn‚Äôt BBBY up 80% after hours? Lmaoooooooo ultimate cock tease

You really are an autist. You think whatever they‚Äôre going to say is going to send SPY up $3.45 by 3pm today for 0dte? Or by $8.45 come Friday if you‚Äôre playing 11/5
Yeah
That‚Äôs what I thought
You were damn close. Impressive. Still not enough to get them to 10k, but wow. That was a rally

what does that mean? bullish? bearish? iron condorish?
short term bullish

Bearish for long dated government bonds.
Bullish. Economy is getting stronger. Still cheap to borrow.
Doesn't this thing always tank after JPow is done talking?
When he starts, usually.

Have you tried telling him?
I just try to keep him on track by saying shit like ‚Äúoh is it not working‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat part are you at again‚Äù. That usually gets him moving again. But Fuck, he‚Äôs grown.
Ask I‚Äôm if he bought spy calls he might not need the job anymore ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
JPow could talk his way out of anything. He must have been a lawyer at some point in his career

Are those two things related?

They ‚ò†Ô∏è
I assume so, but it‚Äôs important to watch instead of just assume or believe.
Assume? Spy is up .5%
And how fast did that happen? I got calls baby, I know just exactly how quick a .5% pump can turn into a pile of slushy shit.
Does it look like it will, today will be the 60th record high close this year on S&P

Three times in history has that happened, each time a 4 year bull run commences
Spy 500 by January
Dec baby
ROKU is broku.
SPY gonna continue to melt up
Lmao bears are dead....4 more years
Lawd gme was a bulltrap. New bag holders at 250+ lmao
You see most are FOMO'ing in OTM options that will expire worthless , so they can't even baghold.
My new bags at $245...LOL...I never learn with memes
I had a stop loss. Took a deficit.. couldnt risk bagholding this
Buy the dip sell the rip every time on this.

Agreed, probably a good idea to try and get in the middle so you know you make profit since it will probably be a wide range today

Go up OCGN

Yes. Let the people sell they will regret later

I know for you gamblers, a $10,000+ gain for you is not much. But for me life changing. My $F Calls are almost ITM and do not expire for almost two months... I literally cannot believe I finally held onto a gamble that I almost folded many times..

OCGN going to have a day baby! EUL approved. Premarket Sheboygan‚Äôs happening now but it‚Äôs going to soar on open.
Shenanigans?
Autocorrect got me but I do like Sheboygan as a secondary
Free money : buy puts on $PINS, its crashing back sub 20$ after ER trust me
Got any insights? The only news I see looks positive.
serious ? everybody is selling $PINS, big money no longer believes in it, and it has a melting userbase
Definitely did it last time. Why you think it will happen again?
melting userbase, ceo dumping all his shares, and everybody is dumping PINS ( big money i mean look at ARK for example )
Will think about this one. It dumped after last ER even with an earnings beat because of a declining user base.
Okay bet
So tell me toilet gang, what has your toilet foretold about the market today?

Jpow is an American hero
..until you realize that the inflation he caused acts as a regressive tax, hitting the poor and middle classes the hardest, and funneling that money to the rich via asset inflation.
If he didn't do this you wouldn't have a stock market during/after the pandemic , take your pick
There's money to be made in up markets and down markets.  Comes down to the question of is this a free market or not?  My pick is leave shit alone and don't exacerbate financial crises for large swaths of the most vulnerable populations.
> The Great Depression was caused by the Federal Reserve System, which is a central bank.
Bruh, do you understand that companies would go bankrupt, people would lose jobs , crime would hit the roof and civil unrest would be the outcome. You can't leave something like that and hope for the best. Give him credit for what he's done, easy for us to talk a good game .
In a free market, bankrupt companies get sold in pieces to the highest bidder.  I'm sorry, I thought this was America.
Yes and that's what should happen when a company fails due to its own fault. You gonna blame a hotel for failing during covid? , an airline?, a gymn? Etc etc 

Emergency times call for emergency steps, it wasn't these companies faults and least of all the people that worked there
you're conflating low interest rates (j.pow) with emergency stimulus (trump).  I'm no trump fan, but I agree that emergency stimulus was necessary for the examples that you mentioned.

propping up the stock market due by keeping rates low was not an emergency response to covid. it was an emergency response to the fears of a massive voting block (boomers).
If you didn't have low interest rates companies wouldn't borrow, it all goes back to the same deal.
most companies were, and still are, sitting on a massive amount of capital.  driving the cost of debt down was unnecessary and politically-driven.
That shits gonna happen anyway, it‚Äôs built into the system
Feels like the bears are going to get it today.
Who is selling their Z puts at open and who is seeing how much further it dips?

GME mooning on no Volume. You guys don't learn. Welcome soon to be Cultists
Way more volume then usual. You don't know shit really
>Way more volume then usual

Because GME volume is always shit since the squeeze. 
If it can Moon on 1 Mil Vol it can get fucked the same way.
True enough. But apes have direct registered a shitload of shares and will diamond diamond for the moon that's probably never coming. I'll use a trialing and enjoy my potentially 20k day already
Apes didn't even register 1% of the oustanding shares. You need to get out of your Echochamber and look at the cold facts.

Big facts unfortunately
TLRY is ready to EXPLODE!

Cathy Wood's strategy is to buy the dip on EVERY stock
Her strategy is to ride elons coat tails.  Like many of us.
Atvi calls seem too easy
I got 1/21 $70c
picked up a couple Jan 72.5s - this seems like a couple grand being given away for free.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Hoping it doesn‚Äôt continue to tank
i will buy PYPL at 220
Markets already beginning to taper lol

Get your VIX calls ready
When has the market ever sold off due to Jpow? Years ago (2018)? And he got chewed out by EVERYONE for that. Jpow knows the same ppl begging him to hike rates will also blame him when the market crashes due to him hiking rates. Jpow will talk about how inflation is still transitory, he will taper "soon" (but not this month) and that everything is good and fine, including this asset bubble, which is fine and transitory
Are you serious? It happened around June 2020. Market was mooning and crashed to hell within a 5 minute window.
Yeah I‚Äôve definitely seen it happen more than once. What‚Äôs weird to me is that there was no dip leading up to this. There almost always has been recently when he talks which makes me think the upside is limited but the downside is massive all depending on what he says.
The amount of GME bull traps the past few months.. GUH
Zillow has been massacred
WTF TSLA, we are not done yet
Someone give me a ticker that can 50x my portfolio by EOD
Easy! That ticker would be (user has been disconnected)
GUH
SPY
this is the season of puts make ur money while u can
History is not on your side
Everyone is buying puts, I buy calls. This market is so retarded, that whatever happens we'll get a relief rally. Lol
OCGN earnings on 9 nov. there is going to be another big run up, it‚Äôs COVAX news is getting approved by literally everybody. Buy a 60 day call and sell weeklies
Cathie getting wet seeing Z down 20%. She's probably buying a shitton of shares as we speak. We'll find out about it EOD when she sends her email thing.
Nah, she's only into profitable companies like TDOC and PLTR.... heh
Z's like a $30 stock considering it has nothing that makes money or has a competitive edge in a stagnant/declining market
Spy puts are gonna wreck me I feel it
don't do it.
[deleted]
pls
Last call to get in ROOT before shorts have to cover 60% of float. About to V shape
They‚Äôve been saying this since august. Why now?
Look at the $7.5C 11/19 Open interest and the short data. Will make sense. Someone is shorting like 19K contracts.
I‚Äôm in but if you‚Äôre wrong you have to tell me where you live
Not wrong, bouncing off of support
Breaking News:

Everyone thinks they‚Äôre Burry buying puts trying to call a top lol
Yes, endlessly buying calls to try to time a bottom is much higher IQ

Stfu and try to make money
endlessly buying calls has been the right move for a year and a half. what point are you trying to make?
Reread the thread and you'll see that I said nothing about whether the plays were right or not.
reread the thread and youll see that no one made the argument that buying calls was high iq.
> Everyone thinks they‚Äôre Burry buying puts 

 
How do you interpret that
i read that the only way it can be read, bers r dum n fuk.
Today was the earnings day for SPY. As always it beat estimates.
Sooo‚Ä¶ COIN to $400?
Finally. Something we can all agree on.
a nothing burger.. bers r fuk
lololololl

Buying SPY puts because you thought the taper would bring red.  Uhhhh no...that'd be too obvious.  That's been priced in for forever.  Tapering announcement finally removed cloudiness about its timing.  We finally can move on.  That's why the market returned a Shrek dong after it was announced that JPow is tapering.
I told you guys yesterday to buy spy calls smh
show us your positions
I have 468c, and 470c 11/5 and 470c 11/12 and a small amount of 450p 11/5 just in case it doesn‚Äôt go my way
Permabull checking in.. just bought a few puts on SPY. Why do I feel so dirty? why do I immediately regret what I just did?
Permabulls don't buy puts you impostor
Idk why you did.

JPOW didn't say anything negative.
he's losing it, knows these are not truths and his brain is having issues
Bears sitting around with voodoo dolls of JPowl sticking needles in his eyes and praying he says inflation is not transitory
JPOW has our back all in calls

Upvote if you‚Äôre poor
This is probably the only place I'll admit it: I'm poor.

I make $220 monthly car loan payments. I *could* pay off car loan in full with gains from meme stocks, but I won't. I will take the risk because I want to *not* be poor. And if I am wrong, then, we'll, I'll just keep making monthly car loan payments and that.
GME will fly today, look at the volume, it's crazy low.
its more volume in 3 hours that in some days in all premarket.

Puts on my starbucks barista. Bitch made me a coffee with literally 40% cream... the fuck is this supposed to be a grande milkshake?
Your fault for not drinking your coffee black.
Black coffee in the AM, but black coffee twice a day ends up giving me heart burn by the end of the week. Getting older is a bitch.
You did go to a Starbucks.
My practice is in the middle of a lower middle class neighborhood, the other options in quick driving distance are 1 of 8 gas stations or a casino.
She lives a happier life than you.
Her toilet lives a sadder life than mine
That‚Äôs the worst thing about the pandemic. Having to order your milk of choice from the counter. How haven‚Äôt they standardized splash, light, etc.  I get the same drink almost every day.  Some days it‚Äôs way to much cream some days not enough.   You figure they could manage that right?  One of three days it is right.
I don't know how else to ask for a tiny bit of cream other than like...2 tbsps? Like fuck lady why would I ask for a small splash of cream if what I wanted was 200 mL of it
Everything is at ATHs and the FEDs are about to announce that the game is over and some people are talking about buying calls, interesting...
Honestly, can you blame anyone? Apple misses, pulls guidance, and the dip is bought up at opening the next day. Hertz declares bankruptcy, its stock doubles. Tesla sells .75% of all cars in US? Better make it worth everyone combined.

#REAL INFLATION IS 15%, feels like 30%, paid $4.50 for a bottle of water at the airport, drinking fountains were covered with plastic.
airport water was $4.50 like 3 years ago, and non shit airports have those water dispensers that you could your bottle under.
$4.50 for airport water is a fucking steal my guy, I‚Äôve seen them upwards of $10
Lol airports are always expensive
Airport inflation has always been 300%
Lol Airport food and drink is always expensive af. Guaranteed $15 for a shitty sandwich and water from Starbucks
Yeah every airport has been doing this lately wtf
I don‚Äôt care about your personal problems.
I haven't noticed. Drinks are free at the business lounge
Airport prices are high!? Weimar all over again. Proud boys was a sign of hyperinflation.

Yeah, all you GME bagholders were talking that good shit a moment ago. Now look what happened.  
  
**Y'ALL GOT KICKED IN YO CHEST**
Tapering is priced in ya nerds. If everyone thinks it's going to crash the market, disappointing news seems good if it's not worse case scenario. That's how this market works.
Everything just randomly spikes and then plummets. Manipulation?
FOMC dumbass
It‚Äôs algos trying to work out wtf is going on
Fuck yo puts

-jpow
SPY RED AGAIN

Update: SPY GREEN NOW
VIX is down, SPY is up. We continue to run. It's priced in, like the few of us have been saying. Doesn't matter if there are negative implications. If the implications have been doomed and gloomed for an entire month, turns out it isn't that bad, we go up.
If CNBC is covering it, it's the expectation.
VIX is impacted by derivatives. No one is actually buying underlying assets - just look at the volume today.
POWELL FOR A SECOND TERM
AGAIN I SAY AGAIN, Imagine being a TSLA bear lol
I swear to god if the market drops tomorrow because it was a ‚Äúlate reaction‚Äù to what Jpow said I‚Äôd be pissed
Almost guaranteed
honestly im getting mentally ready for it cuz im seeing so much green today i dont want to get spoiled by it
I know how WallST works I bet you they‚Äôll play that move tomorrow-next week following. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve finally fully digested everything said‚Äù
I cut my rather large losses and sold what was lwft

Me neither. Probably gonna leave.
you'll be back. don't lie.
Maybe when things get exciting again or when it‚Äôs funny here
Where to tho
Idk. The gym or the bar maybe lol.
It got too much attention with the GME play.
i hate to say it but this JPOW guy seems kind of privileged.

&#x200B;

i think he should work at wendy's to get a feel for inflation.

&#x200B;

guarantee it would be a better metric than whatever the fuck the fed is using.
just in case it hasn't been said, man I admire Jpow's professionalism and sincerity up there. the man is focused on his job responsibilities, and takes the job seriously. 

he may get a 2nd term

If this works, I'm tracking you down and consensually kissing you on the mouth.
I barely slept dreaming about meme stocks
Zillow in the shadow realm
They made a big oopsie
Yeah they‚Äôre idiots. Housing company without a pulse on housing market. The overlooked part of this is they have to cull 25% of workforce. No chance at reversing any time soon
Exactly. How bad do you have to be at reading your own market to fuck up so bad that you have to can a quarter of your workforce to survive? This thing isn‚Äôt coming back for a while.
Literally decided as a business to buy as many homes as possible in one of the largest supply constraint years in history (causing massively inflated prices) and sold them for a loss üíÄüíÄüíÄ
They tried to play it off like the MTM on balance sheet had too much vol. Which isn‚Äôt false. But no chance institionals will want to own a cyclical industry stock at peak selling assets at a loss and laying off its workforce. It‚Äôs prone to tax loss selling too. This is DEAD $$$. Selling calls

Do y‚Äôall think RKT puts are a good idea considering how poorly Zillow did?
No, Zillow made a stupid move that has nothing to do with RKT's business model. RKT just made a deal with Salesforce that is more relevant.
ü§î ok,I just feel like the whole market is way over inflated
Maybe so, but Zillow's foolishness is limited to them and maybe a few of their competitors doing the same thing.

They won‚Äôt allow a taper tantrum to happen. They‚Äôve been through that before. They‚Äôll push it out suitably far enough that any decline cannot be laid on the Fed‚Äôs shoulders.
Nothing but bad trades all October brought me negative in my account.

Monday I say, ‚Äútomorrow, Zillow puts might be a move, I shall deposit some money to make this move‚Äù and my stupid fucking funds still haven‚Äôt gone through. It would have been the best trade I‚Äôve made, and I‚Äôm watching it slip through my hands every day, waiting.
Both the brokerages i use give me the money within 5 minutes how have you not gotten funds
I just opened Schwab, so I don‚Äôt know about them.

But Webull won‚Äôt allow my funds instant access to options, just stock buying. It takes like a week to get options access??

RH I went negative and now they won‚Äôt let me play with my money till it ‚Äúclears the deficit‚Äù
Ah, i see. Yeah i use RH and TD and both still give me money

I just got instant deposit back on RH tho so i feel your pain
Even RH instant deposit is better
Thoughts on playing all birds on ipo?  If it‚Äôs so popular Robinhood won‚Äôt issue shares than might be a crazy opening like coin or hood?

When can we buy shares of Allbirds?

I listened to the votes and FOMO‚Äôed in BB calls at open, after taking a stark loss out of the gate, I was able to just now dump them for a 3% gain.   I‚Äôm sure it will rocket from here but I feel relieved to escape a meme stock with any profit
What‚Äôs the bull thesis for OCGN? The Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines have majority market share. Developed nations also provide these vaccines to poor countries at cost or for free. What am I missing?
Thesis: there are many bags but these bags are mine. Please somebody take them
Nothing it‚Äôs a bag oh shit.
I just bought puts for next week. This thing always falls on its face.
#freee
Developed nations be purchasing the vaccine from its maker, who presumably pays OCGN a pittance of a licensing fee.  Pretty sure they haven't the factories to produce it at scale
Which bag to average down on today.......GME, OCGN, BBBY.  FOMO at its best today for me.
Was hoping OCGN wasn‚Äôt a PnD. In at 8.12$ so I‚Äôm not worried but we‚Äôll see.

I might make high risk 0DTE SPY play to satiate my degeneracy. 461P?

Gme 209 last week it was at 184

Fools. I feel slightly responsible though,  I've been provoking the apes the past week. I guessed i pissed them off enough for it to run
Don't worry. It's dumping like it always does. Pump and dump is literally all it does now for the past few months. MOAP&D's

And it just keeps going up.. how rude
I bought some spy puts yesterday but I just can‚Äôt deal with the market going up when it should go down when they announce taper so I just got back out. So those holding puts now have a chance.
Dont worry I am still holding, Im fucked I know it. Can pull the plug. Im scared. Daddy JPOW is going to wreck my puts, I can feel it.
I was hoping it would fall today BEFORE 2:00
Swung $Z 70P overnight for the smallest gains at the open. Left over 5k on the table :(

I was gonna hold them but didn't wanna get fuk by IV.
Are you me, same thing happened
Fucking retarded brother. Shit hurts :(
whats up buddy, I was hoping u didnt paper hand those like I did my 1 put lol. oh well profit is profit!

TEVA sub $10 is free money.  mark my words.
Explain. It's been hovering around 10 for 6 months. Curious.
hovering so low for so long due to two things (IMO): debt associated with Actavis acquisition and the overhang of opioid litigation.  First item has been slashed by basically half since TEVA absolutely prints free cash.  The second item got a huge catalyst from a ruling in CA yesterday.  The rest of the states are about to fall like dominoes, and TEVA will bounce back to a reasonable p/e
Interesting to see a dip after that ruling. Just read about it. Will watch
we were up 10% after the ruling...

Tapering is already priced in. We‚Äôve known about it for over a month. The fed will probably provide guidance to their plans to change interest rates over the next few years, so that‚Äôs what the market is looking to hearing about mainly.

Closed my PYPL yolo earlier for a loss that MF still tanking
What‚Äôs the reason?
It broke the support I was watching at 227.25
What‚Äôs it‚Äôs next support line? You think it could make a sharp rebound?  Calls would be good if there is a chance of that.
There‚Äôs some support lines around 225 and 222.29 then it drops to the 14 day RSI around 201
It‚Äôs just hard to tell, it definitely deserves an up move but the CEO sold some stock on October 28th so the stock is still in a volatile time
What‚Äôs the reason for selling? Do you know? Could be bad times ahead.
What‚Äôs the reason for the CEO selling? Do you know? Could be bad times ahead.
I‚Äôm actually not sure, he only sold a fraction of his shares of course but it can still be seen as a bad sign for investors, it‚Äôs definitely getting close to a great entry though and going long at this point would be a good grab

AXSM power higher by $1.50 today after consolidating a massive $25% move up two weeks ago.  


Every day that goes by is another day closer to AXS 05, the crown jewel, blockbuster depression treatment getting passed by the FDA. Then in April, the smaller, $300 million a yearly rev. drug AXS 07 will go before the FDA for approval.  


Later in 2022, AXSM will apply for approval of a third drug.  


Anyone not in AXSM by now the window is still open on this expected $150 stock that is currently trading at just over $40.  


Good luck.

Why should I **not** buy these ROOT 11/19 7.5c based on the unusual open interest and high short interest? Why will I lose money on this? Sincerely asking. Talk me out of it.
I'm actually surprised that Zillow didn't have any volatility trading halts today. With the size of tranches getting sold, I'm wondering if institutions are trying to get out quickly but not so fast that they get blocked
holy fuck that's a huge volume sell
They'll get bailed out...
I mean its Zillow with a sub $20 Billion market cap, I don't think there's any bail outs coming for something that small
Get in before the fomo
How to Do that ?
Get lucky lmao

You should have bought earlier. Makes me sad about all the profits my fellow retards have missed out on. I have almost doubled my money. I wish it was the same for all of you!
Bag holders will be made today, godspeed
It‚Äôs definitely not too late, approval and other catalysts will send this fucker $20+
Lmk the next stock then :) I‚Äôve lost enough to be cautious about trusting the people here tbh
I bought it last week, someone in here was talking it up, not sure if it was you, if so, thanks bud.

how much are you up % wise from the beginning of the year? cuz she has an amazing return.
Maybe you need a boyfriend.
She's probably made more than most of us to tbh
20 years from now you will still be in the red and she will have an actual retirement account
+$280 is probably more than a lot have made here haha
Did she spend 40hrs a week on this? If not, she's right, she's up
Holy GuacoMolE

Thoughts on TSLA crossing 1200 today?
Hopeful. But seems unlikely.
Another theta day
Isn‚Äôt this fed meeting taper shit nonsense already priced in? Why would shit tank today? 

$SPY ATH EODüëåüèΩ
Spy up 7% in the last month. That's a 84% YoY pace. Pretty sure nothing is correctly priced in lol.
The drop is way too obvious, everyone might as well load up on puts. Shit ain‚Äôt ‚Äòbout to drop.
Yea flat is also an option.
Flat deez nuts. 

I get what you‚Äôre saying though and maybe you‚Äôre right, tbh.
rip to those who keep missing the $TSLA dips ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) Bought some $1100 dec calls on nearly today's low ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)

Buy some 80c expiring Friday
Cathie bought 288k shares of Z before the drop yikes!
Costanza Principle this bitch to get rich.
She bought 
Hood too.
Yea but HOOD is up 6% today. She addicted to the HOOD.
Lmao how does she do it so consistently
You get on this impossibly long winning streak with a small amount of money, then when you're convinced you're onto something and up the ante, an even more impossibly long losing streak starts. That's how I do it, anyway.
Yeah same dumb question I guess lol
Her excuse is and will be a 5yr time horizon
Has she ever said 5 years from when?
Fuck me.
She is consistent in her methods that‚Äôs for certain
Imagine thinking this rally is over.... SPY 500 by January
spy 500 eow???
Fed announcement didn't crash anything so I'm levering up more on NVDA and TSLA.
you should really wait until Jerome speaks, market is digesting right now
I am going 60% cash. The worst case scenario is I have to buy back in and lose a little bit.
Facing massive inflation and WSB is like, 'good time to go cash'. Never change, WSB, never change
It‚Äôs for a day you retard
SPY at ATHs and WSB is like, 'good time to go cash'. Never change, WSB, never change
Also known as taking profits
Not a fan
Jpow gonna slap 10 inches of limp dick on the podium and say Bull R Fuk!
How fast would this shit fall if Jerome pulled a Rick and Morty and just shot himself live after saying "it's all gonna crash we're fuckkeedd!!" Good thing he won't and it only goes up!
With this market, he could get up there and say there‚Äôs 2,500 Russian warheads in the air and the S&P would go up 10% before the circuit breaker on human life gets flipped
hahahahahah bears fucked
Thank you u/axemanfromMa 

A prophet among us
Fucking told these retards
Tsla 1500 call 11/19 print??
Oh yes!!
So many whiny bears in this fed meeting. nobody cares that your $6 burger is now $9. Meanwhile they freak out if anybody raises the slave wages or if the gov gives people $300 they claim nobody works for a year. They just low goods prices with high real estate prices. Fuck em JPOW
SPY $35 away from $500 and Infa bill about to drop too.

$500 by 12/1/2021, you heard it first here
As insane as it is, I‚Äôm starting to think Tesla might hit 1300 in the next week or two.

Rip it in 2
Tsla put
Probably a call of some sort
lotto-WKHS. Earnings/catalyst: So Fi
Sklz puts maybe
Wait for tomorrow's dip and buy spy debit spreads in the 50/50 range for 11/5. Then amen or ramen
MRO earnings play. Can even buy cheap long calls in January for 1.40 right now. 17 strike
TSLA 1200c‚Äôs printing
They will be worth exactly $5 on Friday close

Should have bought more than 1 call. I freaking knew it.
So this is what Santa Claus Rally means
Just you wait baby

What's the after market close earnings play with expected large moves today guys? Need to gamble in the next 30 minutes before close.

I can‚Äôt picture Jerome saying anything good about interest rates. Inflation going crazy because Demand is extremely high. And with the new wage data + continued low interest rates demand will continue growing. Meanwhile the supply chain is F‚Äôed and can‚Äôt catch up.
That‚Äôs right it‚Äôs mother F‚Äôed

They will not raise rates with the current global supply chain issues.  They may signal that they intend to at a future date though which would have the same effect (big red).

If you feel like reading be my guest.

US Economics Analyst: From Tapering to Rate Hikes (Mericle/Hatzius)

29 October 2021 | 8:46PM EDT

‚ñ†
We are pulling forward our forecast for the Fed‚Äôs first rate hike by one full year to July 2022, shortly after tapering is scheduled to conclude. We expect a second hike in November 2022 and two hikes per year after that. However, the range of possible outcomes is wide, especially in the longer term.
‚ñ†
The FOMC will announce the start of tapering next week, presumably at the $15bn per month pace noted in the September minutes. If implementation begins in mid-November, the last taper would come in June 2022. Large surprises on the virus, inflation, wage growth, or inflation expectations could prompt a revision, but we think the hurdle for a change in either direction is high.
‚ñ†
The main reason for the change in our liftoff call is that we now expect core PCE inflation to remain above 3%‚Äîand core CPI inflation above 4%‚Äîwhen the taper concludes. Sequential core inflation should be lower at that point but still around 2%, with shelter running hot. Taken together, we think this will make a seamless move from tapering to rate hikes the path of least resistance.
‚ñ†
The biggest complication is the guidance in the FOMC statement that even the first rate hike requires maximum employment. However, with inflation far above target, unemployment likely below the median participant‚Äôs 4% NAIRU estimate, and job availability high, we think the committee will conclude that most if not all of the remaining weakness in labor force participation is structural or voluntary.
‚ñ†
We maintain our view that growth will slow to a trend-like pace and inflation will drop to the low 2s by late 2022 or early 2023, without an aggressive monetary policy response. The key reasons are that the level of fiscal support will continue to decline sharply and supply chain problems should be resolved, turning the inflationary surge in the goods sector into a temporary deflationary drag.
‚ñ†
As a result, we see the possible paths ahead as bimodal: if something delays liftoff long enough for growth and inflation to fall sharply by end-2022, the Fed could stay on hold for a while. This was the scenario we previously envisioned.
‚ñ†
Beyond 2022, we forecast one hike every six months. We see this pace as plausible either as a dovish response if inflation remains modestly above 2% or as an average outcome if inflation fluctuates above and below 2%.
Kick that can down the road baby
Good post

Lol besides now it‚Äôs been flat or slowly bleeding
Literally not true
Since September. Yes it has been trending down.
Had high hopes with ocgn. Nothing ever works even when you just want to get lucky for fukin once. Fuk this
High hopes? It's up 100% over the month. What did you expect?

Short answer: yes
Fukin bull trap

If you fall for this little bull trap right now, you should stop trading forever.

Only if elon musk had little brain and that retarded fuck havent put that screenshot. We would have been st 1450 per share on tesla.

Some of you all in twitter stop talking to him, dont fucking drag him to tesla shares
Imagine arguing with a CEO about his company's valuation
There is a reason SEC sued him last year fir manipulation
They are probably the reason he had to calm the speculation this time and admit that the Hertz deal was not material enough to move the stock price like that.
Nah. He just cant take the fact hertz moved the stock more than earnings number did
What screenshot?
There was tesla retard in twitter posted 1213 reached screenshot of tesla share on that psychos twitter. It fucking triggered him
Doubt he reads all his twit reply. It was probably us that threw him off lol

call me when you sell. thx.

Cold like Minnesota!
Analysts who covered Zillow should be investigated for fraud. I read their annual report last year and they were losing 50k+ per home sold. The goal off flipping a house is to make money.  You can‚Äôt do it sitting behind a computer using an algorithm. Every single home is different and must be analyzed independently.  Analysts threw around the word ‚Äúscale‚Äù, like a bunch of idiots. If you a do a dumb thing, doing a lot more of it just makes it even worse.
Jpow dump is gonna begin!

It's bound to go up with all the positive news on the way, i get the feeling hedges are artificially keeping it down and trying to buy all the calls for themselves when people sell from small drops. If you hold and it goes to 30 or 40 youll be super happy, maybe set a stop loss

I should have bought those 130s monday instead of messing with spyüòî im too poor to play lol

Oh wow. Look. FOMC didnt do jack shit to the market. Knew that shit wasnt gonna tank anything at all. It‚Äôs already known what they were gonna do. They just needed to hear it and signaled the bulls it‚Äôs ok to buy for the rest of the year.

2) if you feel like you understand all this stuff now, goodluck, you're headed back to $88.  And I salute you for it.

SPY holding above resistance for sis amount of time. Drill team 6 awaiting orders
DEPLOY DAMNIT!
It seems bizarre for people to still be selling Z after Z has dropped nearly 40% since the start of Monday - all for correcting a mistake that they made. I'd be more worried about them if they doubled down on that flawed model.
this market is super sentimental. a huge percentage of the buyers have no idea what they're buying, they're just following momentum. they see it go up, they buy, they see it go down, they sell.
This. Imagine what happens if we ever get a decent correction ..
Yeah momentum is going down. My cost basis is 97 so tbh thinking about averaging down. They have profitable businesses in IMT and premier agents with expanding margins
Not gonna try to time the bottom but I‚Äôm with you, plan on buying leaps as soon as the dust settles
Second run for GME tomorrow or is it done?
guaranteed run on the 24th
I think it needs some news to really run

"brrrrrrrrr !" (while making a cranking motion)
He stood up. And said everything is fine as it is let‚Äôs keep printing.   Maybe reassess middle of next year. 

Done in 10 minutes . Being serious he‚Äôs  the best person ever
did robinhood start raising margin on unrealized gains? cuz i keep waking up to more margin available even though i havent closed my position
I think they quietly changed margin requirements on meme stocks. I just got a lot more margin too.
Margin is based on cash and equity holdings. Your long stocks go up, so does margin. If it's going up based on SPY FDs, well then get puts on HOOD lol
it hasnt happened before. I always have to close my position to make it a realized gain in order to get the margin match. youre saying it should reset every day? i guess thats why my cash goes up too, cuz the margin is replacing some of my own invested cash
I don't know the resetting time frame, probably depends on broker. But yah your long equities are collateral for your margin loan. How much collateral it is is based on hold time and volatility of the ticker. But Robinhood doesn't always play by the same rules as other brokers, so you may have to call to get an explanation.
they got back to me and said it resets overnight. it only started happening this week. the only thing i can think of is that i havent been selling CCs lately. maybe the CCs were tying up the shares and preventing the margin bump. idk

Right.  They can only sell to US and Canada.  Today's news means nothing for OCGN.
Downvote me all you want, but seriously, get out of the indexes. 

Big money is gonna start deleveraging via dark pools on fed news, and the indexes will get rekt.

This is a PSA. Do what you want with it.
Is this the housing crash I've been waiting for to buy a home?
What crash do you speak of. Can you elaborate
Memeing, I am still going to get shafted buying a house.
Ah, well my advice to you is. Buy when you can. It‚Äôs going to take a lot longer for the prices in houses to crash before rates start to tick up again. You‚Äôll be better off taking advantage of the low rates right now before your banking on the housing prices to fall.
Not yet. Give it time and the foreclosures will start and the banks will have lots of property's to get rid of = for cheap.
Lol‚Ä¶you think this is 2008, cute.
When interest rates rise, many will variable rate mortgages will be unable to meet their mortgage payments and when whose properties come onto the market all at once, prices will go down, leaving homeowners under water and they will walk away. The underlying issues will be different from 2008 but the unwinding process will be similar. Real estate has a boom and bust cycle.
I just can‚Äôt get myself to jump on the GME bandwagon.
Smartest thing you could do
Sucker bet. I‚Äôm selling calls
Fair enough, but you're missing out. People are not able to short like before, now that the amount of shares that are on DRS is super high.
Wow what a hot take
I know that‚Äôs the frustrating part. I‚Äôm missing out and I‚Äôm worried of jumping in too late or too early (I play options)
Good
Same here. Almost bought a few shares the last few weeks when it was down under 200, but just wasn't down quite far enough. Definitely can't now
I don‚Äôt believe in the company.
Who cares boomer? I don't believe in like 90% of these companies but I'm damn sure gonna make money off the pumps
Well, there's that too. I haven't bought anything at GameStop for 5 years now probably

the brainlets over at r/conspiracy are believing pizzagate is real again lol and also i saw someone post there a babylon bee article and refer to it as if it was not satire

it is a terrible place but it's like a car wreck i can't look away. i do think it should probably be a banned subreddit but it is nice to see them get dunked on whenever the posts reach r/all
to be fair babylon bee is so terribly unfunny that I wouldn‚Äôt really call it satire either.

So is VXX the inverse of SPY? I'm confused by its function
no, its volatility. Spy slow bleeds down = vix doesnt care. Spy drops 5% in an hour = vix spikes
This makes sense. Thanks üòä
Basically. There's more to it, but don't overload yourself.

VXX is more like a trailing indicator of fear.

So of SPY drops, VXX goes up and vice versa.

I‚Äôm thinking the election results in New Jersey and Virginia may be part of what has been delaying the infrastructure bill. I think with what the results are the 1.5 trillion infrastructure passes soon, and they go back and re-think the ‚ÄúSocial Infrastructure‚Äù part now.
We will end up with a solid true infrastructure bill with a few social infrastructure tidbits tacked on, which would be great for everyone.

In light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee‚Äôs goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. Beginning later this month, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $70 billion per month and of agency mortgage‚Äëbacked securities by at least $35 billion per month. Beginning in December, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $60 billion per month and of agency mortgage backed securities by at least $30 billion per month.



So they‚Äôre still increasing asset purchases but by a tapered amount??? Can someone read this and make sure I‚Äôm not crazy?
They're still performing asset purchases but a decreased amount per month
They said they‚Äôd reduce the per month purchase amount. They‚Äôre actually reducing the per month purchase increase. 

That‚Äôs like reducing acceleration vs. velocity. They‚Äôre still speeding up! Inflation is going to continue!
That‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs they are doing and said they would do for months

Short selling of stock is not allowed at this time.  
There are no additional requirements on long or short options at this time.  
We may implement additional requirements on opening trades on options the day they expire.  
Please keep in mind that additional security and strategy requirements can be added and may change at any time, without notice due to volatility or other market conditions.

How do you keep your motivation? Don't feel like to keep being active after college smh
Ehh, at some point it's not really about motivation, you just kinda have to do it. After college is an important time to stay active man. You're making money, have your own place, probably a relatively stable lifestyle that allows for a good daily routine. Don't slack on how good of a time this is to better yourself. Don't wanna get sloppy (physique wise) as you get older.

 I don't even like lifting weights, just something I gotta keep doing though.

Also for me, I haven't been as consistent this year due to multiple reasons, but in general..guilt gets me to the gym as well. I feel guilty as fuck if I miss multiple sessions
That's exactly my situation lol. Especially I got married shortly after school I don't need to stay in shape to impress girls, so I'm eating the same amount but not active at all and shortly after I started to having a belly and I hated it, starting to workout more last couple months but just lost motivation. You're right I just have to do it for health reason, god speed brother.

All logic says you are right of course, but in 2021 the markets don't operate on logic.
Anyone is in HOOD? Where do you think it will go from here? I see it double next couple of weeks, if not sooner.  Any thoughts?
Why the fuck would it double? Hood is such a pos and pissed off half their users

Double digits maybe
A lot of the labor shortages could be fixed by allowing more immigration. Will anyone ever figure it out? Probably not.

There's a chance we don't have another pullback for 10 years.
We're three weeks without a real red day. Who the fuck knows.
Good luck champ. I‚Äôve been thinking that for the last 2 weeks now & only won 1 of 4 put plays. I‚Äôve given up & now just riding the trend, for better or worse lol.
I thought the same thing last week‚Ä¶.. trying to time the top of spy when it‚Äôs on a hot streak is a baaaaaad idea mate. The expected tapering announcement came with zero surprises, so this means‚Ä¶.. bulls are safe to buy. Nothing to spook the market anymore. We‚Äôre closing the year on green months for sure
Just grabbed some 11/24 451 puts. RSI over 72 on SPY. Bond markets went nuts last week around the world. Also, now that everyone isn‚Äôt on Fed-watch, just waiting for negative headlines on China‚Äôs current COVID outbreak to roll out this weekend and depress the market next week.

Instead of student loan forgiveness they should match 5% of payments made into SPY that you‚Äôre able to cash out once it‚Äôs paid off. This would pump the markets, incentivize payments and anyone who wouldn‚Äôt want that is too dumb to understand the benefits
Yes with the caveat that the usurious interest rates be dealt with so people don‚Äôt spend their entire lives paying interest.

Do you guys not realize this is artificial inflation to mask the deflationary period we are in and soon banks will realize that people don‚Äôt got any money so they gonna stop lending and shits gonna start defaulting and with the artificial high prices of everything no ones gonna be able to buy shit and everything is gonna get fucked like everyones gonna default on their loans and the Great Depression will be surpassed by the most epic depression

This allowed it to sing much more loudly and with greater range than normal, leading the audience at one performance to believe that he had been assisted by angels.
when the fed said inflation was transitory they were incorrect. partially because they were unclear. when the fed discusses inflation it refers to inflation due to monetary policy. the reason the fed was incorrect by claiming inflation due to monetary policy was transitory is not because such inflation is long lasting, but actually because such inflation is nonexistent
No they were right. It either transitions into higher inflation or lower inflation. I‚Äôll send you my TA
Imagine if the Fed admitted inflation wasn‚Äôt transitory. The World would go nuts. The Fed is like a doctor in the ER telling a kid who just got his hand blown off from fireworks that it‚Äôs just a slight cut
well tbf it's just that the period of "transitory" is essentially passed. The Fed shouldn't do any panic-signaling because there's nothing to panic about of course. but the thing is there's nothing that the fed can do about it anyways since it's just still pandemic related shit with supply chain issues and with last year's unusually low prices. i personally don't think the inflation is a big problem and i also think the fed should keep doing what they're doing. politicians need to stop stoking fear in their gullible constituents
Nothing to panic about, trying being in the bottom 50 percent of the country. Trying dealing with inflation on a fixed income. You are fucked. The Fed could have done something if they wanted to, they could have tapered early. Stimulating demand when supply chains are fucked makes 0 sense. JPow was just trying to keep his job by keeping the economy roaring, but this was a horrible decision as the economy should have cooled to stop inflation
tapering early would have been so much worse. Unemployment benefits should have continued, especially now with hindsight proving that UI had nothing to do with keeping people away from jobs.

calling powell's actions "a horrible decision" for keeping us out of a certain recession that would have been worse than 2008 is laughable
Please explain how tapering early would have been a bad thing? Unemployment benefits did not need to continue as inflation would have only surged. If you give money to our poorest they spend it ASAP. Producers also raise prices because they know people are getting transfer payments. They didn‚Äôt work for it so why should they care about paying more. 

QE stimulates demand. We do not have a demand problem. This is a supply problem. Cut down the excessive demand and let supply chains work themselves out. 

JPow is only concerned with a 2nd term. He could have tapered in the spring of 2021 but he was doing whatever the WH wanted so he could get a 2nd term
demand would stagnate and then it would have been clear that inflation would continue regardless since the factors leading to inflation haven't changed. that's a bad thing imo idk maybe you think differently.

>Unemployment benefits did not need to continue as inflation would have only surged

wrong? producers aren't raising prices because they know people are getting transfer payments. this is called price gouging and during an emergency (such as a global pandemic) this is illegal.

>QE stimulates demand. We do not have a demand problem

thanks to powell and the fed
Your analysis isn‚Äôt even close to right. Ending QE would stagnate demand? I don‚Äôt think so. 

Price gouging. We live in a free market. It would not be illegal. Take a look at college tuition over the last 40 years. The more we give students access to loans the more colleges raise their prices. 

I can‚Äôt tell if this is JPow burner or you actually haven‚Äôt a clue about economics and how monetary policy works. Here‚Äôs a hint, when you print trillions of dollars producers raise prices to capture those trillions of dollars. Even worse when supply chains are already broken
lol stupid
Can‚Äôt tell if you are retarded or just want JPow to blow more bubbles
i mean you're the one who is so off base on all this. price gouging not illegal during an emergency? there's maybe 5 states where this is the case. why refer to college tuition that's irrelevant. i have an economics degree i have at least an above average understanding of economics and monetary policy. economic theory and also real life evidence over the past 13 years has proven that printing trillions of dollars does not necessarily lead to higher prices.

but it's okay the discussion is done i think we've settled on where we're just going to have to agree to disagree. i personally think recession is bad and you think it's good and we won't come to terms there

Anyone ever have surgery to fix a deviated septum? When am I gonna be able to breath again
Have your doctor recommend you to an ENT specialist. You might get part of it covered by insurance (not the cosmetic portion)
I didn‚Äôt, but a friend did. The few days after the surgery were apparently hell on earth between the pain and the blood draining down his throat, but he was able to breathe after. Ymmv
Literal mouthbreather here
Not for long
Hope you feel better soon

Lol too early retard
I meant when casino opens lol
VisualMod says we got taper. Since it became known news in premarket, I think that means market opens with it priced in and we just keep climbing
QE/tapering is not something that gets priced in, otherwise we wouldve spiked 100% in the span of a month back in march 2020

you can expect SPY pumps to get weaker over the next 6 months, and by the time its over markets will be back to normal (aka not going up infinitely for no fukken reason)

i mean its a good play, if you go far out enough youll catch the bounce, and 4q can surprise
they probably know that already
That last statement is gonna send AAPL to all time highs

Can someone explain to my retarded brain why the markets shot up after the tapering news? Is it more dovish than expected?
They are keeping rates stable, bull run continues cause the market will return more than the shit rate bonds
Powell continues to use excessively dovish language at every turn. Basically making baby steps forward in the most dovish way possible
Stuck with the narrative and didn‚Äôt change to something more hawkish like $20B/month tapering. That and Powell‚Äôs non-answers on the questions about tapering 1-2 times next year

$gme puts and $spy calls from earlier today looking good. Of course I am greedy so letem ride.
Make COIN open up the ledgers and let's fund whatever Biden wants.
I just got a few comments saying I don‚Äôt understand politics. Let me put it this way you absolute cunts- Biden won Virginia by 10 points. Virginia just elected a republican governor who was expected to lose the election and was not a Trump type candidate. Virginia was SOLIDLY in Dem‚Äôs pockets and they lost the governor seat. This doesn‚Äôt bode well for them. 

This means Biden just lost Congress. Or at least, republicans now see a light at the end of the tunnel. They see a way to win. They have the votes. They don‚Äôt need Trump. They have Congress in the bag in a few months. Same thing happened to Obama during midterms. 

Now that they know pretty soon that Congress will be theirs (if they swung Virginia, they‚Äôre probably going to kill the midterms), they will not cooperate. They will put added pressure on Manchin and no infrastructure bill will pass. 

It‚Äôs a bad outlook for the bill passing, which will shake investor confidence. That with the FOMC means today is likely to be bearish.
You must be new, government gridlock = super bull period.
Maybe. But right now investors seem to care more about the infrastructure bill. Or whatever they‚Äôre calling the multi-trillion bill they‚Äôre trying to pass now. 

If that waivers the whole market waivers.
Lol if you‚Äôre going to try to give a political take at least know what the fuck you‚Äôre talking about. The republicans want the infrastructure bill. They don‚Äôt want the other spending bill the dems are trying to pass. JFC you‚Äôre actually retarded. I just thought you were trolling earlier.
Then why hasn‚Äôt a single one voted for it? I think you‚Äôre missing the forest here my dude. 

Look at the big picture. Everyone is watching Virginia today. All eyes are on that race. It indicates the big giant spending bill democrats want ‚Ä¶ the one that started way high like 5t and has been cut to 1.5t‚Ä¶ it just became an even bigger issue. 

This isn‚Äôt about politics. It‚Äôs about the market. And the market I think will care.
Lol how fucking dense are you? It‚Äôs two separate bills. The infrastructure bill has already passed the senate with a 60% majority vote (so yes republicans voted for it) and is now just waiting on the house to vote for it. The hold up is a separate spending bill the dems want to pass at the same time. JFC
Haha. Chill bro. Wow you really think caring about these little details makes you smart huh? 

But look at how wound up you are. So tense. So agitated. It‚Äôs cool dude. 

I was referring then to the spending bill. No need to get all twisted.
Lol I‚Äôm not wound up, just shocked at how stupid you are.
Nah bro you‚Äôre pretty wound up. Look at you trying to insult me still haha. 

You‚Äôre fucking frothing at the mouth the get the insults in. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh yeah if I can call this guy stupid, fuck that will make me feel sosoooooo good about myself. Finally. I can love myself. Finally I‚Äôm worth more than just trash‚Äù 

That‚Äôs what you sound like. Insecure as fuck lol.
No, you didn't know the difference between a Governor and a Senator. Nice try.
Yeah, I thought he was trolling earlier. Now I realize he‚Äôs actually just that retarded.
It doesn‚Äôt matter. The state swung from blue to red. That indicates a reversal. That predicts the midterms race. 

This is what will be going through the minds of all the news talking heads today.
I see it differently. Government gridlock for the next year? Sounds like less uncertainty to me. ATHs won't stop any time soon.
> I'm not sure what this means.
‚ù§Ô∏è when VMod decides to broadcast its uncertainty
Way to many political words,,,, you going to get banned üò¨
It‚Äôs related to the infrastructure bill which is related to the market.
Way to save yourself at the end!
Dems will steal an important elections when they need to. Don‚Äôt get carried away.
Well said infrastructure would be the last pump before next recession. Possible it won‚Äôt be as deep though as if Dems held house and win senate
Virginia has always elected moderate types from either party. This isn't super unexpected and I doubt it influences anything.
Okay folks let all get back down to reality now‚Ä¶.

This fake pump on GME, AMC, and other "meme stocks" which in reality are worth a tiny fraction of what their current market-caps suggest, is one last ditch effort right before the big volatility comes. Bulls, as sure as your dick is tiny, you can bet the dreaded t word is coming. Tapering! üëª Stop living in a fantasy world, the party ends now and the real bear market begins. A market which won't stop until we see the bottom over 50% lower than what current prices are (I actually think 60-70% selloff is possible market wide). The time of the bear is nigh!

8.5% isn't much, lol
8.5% borrowing fee. Not short interest rate
I know. Shorts will only start to feel pressure once it's like 50% or above. The borrow fee is the annual percentage. So they pay like a penny a day to short the stock at percents that low.
No the borrowing fee was a monthly percentage
Schwab asked to borrow my shares for 8.5% a month
That might be what Schwab is paying you, but it's not what shorts are paying Schwab if the borrow fee for them is 8.5%. Trust me, I short stuff all the time. The borrow fee is annual percentage.

Intc is becoming a great value company. I‚Äôm in 100 shares and will sell spreads for all of next year.
if you like it at 50, you'll love it at 30
Not going to 30 with a p/e of 10 and earnings of 18 billion a quarter. CEO is aggressive in catching up with AMD and TSMC. Company is sitting on lots of cash all fundamentals point to a good 5 year outlook. MSFT was undervalued for over a decade and now look at it
you think earnings won't go down? hahaha
Not a bad idea but I'm also an INTC shill.
INTC has fumbled their leadership role the past 2 years. AMD and NVDA sapped all the power out of that company. What could have been a global chip leader in the time of high demand, decided to be a retard with boomer growth rate
Awesome, see you at 25

How are we not hyping overstock here?
What do you mean? We already overstock on hype here.
Maybe it's overstock, get it?
Zillow puts printing so hard why did i not go all in
Attn people who know what they're doing. Is this GME a pullback or is it done for now?
#no one knows what they are doing
A full erasure of the daily candle is NOT a pullback. That was shorts exiting their position and then selling off the shares.
If you buy to cover a short, and then sell off the shares, you are still net short.
pull back to 200 then back up
If you're looking for people who know what they're doing, you could not possibly be farther away.

If GME somehow makes it to 230 and holds it, the next target is 245. Wtf man
If your aunt had a dick she would be your uncle
And if it hits 245 the next is 260!

And if it hits 260 the target is 285!

From 300 we‚Äôll see 425!

Anyone playing $ATVI rebound?
Yeah I think it dipped way too hard. Especially if there are gonna be holiday shortages too.
Is atvi trying to recover? Buy?

Edit: nevermind
I don't understand why ATVI is down close to 15% post earnings, numbers were not bad. And new Call of Duty launch is day after tomorrow.
looks like an overreaction to me. I bought in AH yesterday, wish i had waited to buy at these bargain basement prices. but oh well still got a discount.
I am going to wait till end of day today and will start adding to my long-term portfolio. It's a profit making company with reasonable PE ratio.
ya i think it's a solid value buy. it might take a little bit to recover from this but analysts are giving it a gigantic upside, and they continue to grow.

Y‚Äôall need to jump in on DLTR w me! I bought 120c exp Jan 2022 on Monday and they‚Äôre already up 50%‚Ä¶ earnings at the end of this month and I think they‚Äôre gonna keep running until then, at least‚Ä¶
Margin pressure. No thanks.
Could you explain? I‚Äôm not sure what margin pressure means‚Ä¶
Sold Z puts earlier for measly 20% gains. Would have been a 2 bagger by now.

> Tesla is a company that makes cars. They make electric cars which are much cooler than normal ones. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, said in an interview with Recode on Wednesday that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share and already has secured funding for this to happen.

Bed Bath and Beyond had an after hours announcement of a ~~merger~~ partnership with Kroger and an online platform. Plus they moved up their timetable to buy back shares 2 years ahead of schedule.

Should I dollar cost average on snap or just yolo it all at once?
DCA as it goes to zero, all in as it goes to zero. Same thing.
This is WSB, we YOLO.
Snap is the biggest cock tease stock, goes up crashes down. If you can swing it do so because you'd probably make bank
There is a small chance that the market makers may want to drop it to the 40s but it dosent seem likely imo(assuming no news catalysts). I would start at least half of your target position size at these levels or more depending on your conviction in the stock.

If you want super high end designer sneakers you can try Balenciaga‚Äôs they‚Äôre pretty comfortable.

Hopefully rip, my Dec calls are not looking great right now.  Been acting like a bitch for awhile now.
If the market panics we sell off with it. Could continue into tomorrow and the market will rebalance. Earnings will be good so could take off after that. Its just how low will it be when in it does so

What happened to BROS?? Why the sudden dive
> It is a combination of things. Firstly, the market was overbought and it had to correct itself at some point. Secondly, there were several whales who bought in around $0.15-$0.20 range and they are now dumping their bags as we speak for profits (they will come back with more BROS once this dump settles). Thirdly, people started panicking after seeing such a steep drop without any apparent reason - which led them to sell off their holdings as well (which further increased the price plummet).

SPY up 0.09%. This is nothing.
Volatility is shit low, I know because I have bleeding calls on that.
Am I calling or putting COIN earnings?
Well coin is at an all time high. Id sit it out.
Have to you used it? They must be making insane amounts of money with the fees and spread they are taking and zero effort put into the actual application.

Their fees when selling are ridiculous, think they‚Äôll blow out earnings but who knows
COF is such a weird stock. sometimes it moves with financials, sometimes with tech, sometimes with fintech.
Nvda probably going to keep pumping isn't it

Here's what I fail to understand:

Is this just undervalued or was there some sort of consensus that they'd beat earnings by even more than they have?

Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

Damn. Imagine being all in Zillow on a day like this
Pls AAPL just go up a dollar
My portfolio is over 70% $OUST. Current average is $7.30 a share. Could either be one of the dumbest or smartest decisions I‚Äôve ever made. I truly believe in $OUST long term though. Not down too much at the moment. We‚Äôll see how it goes. I‚Äôm holding for the long haul though.
Yes yes thats a very safe play
Can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre being sarcastic or not, but I truly do believe that $OUST will be a big success in the long term. I‚Äôve probably done days worth of DD on them. I‚Äôve definitely been wrong before though, so I‚Äôm prepared to be wrong again. Time will tell. Not selling anytime soon though. This is a long play for me, and I have 100% conviction in $OUST.
Why oust? Aren't there a bunch of companies in the space doing similar stuff, velodyne?
Yes there are several other competitors in the space, but $OUST is currently the only publicly traded company offering digital solid state lidar which (due to Moore‚Äôs Law) is far cheaper to manufacture, requires far less parts, and is far more scalable that the analog lidar used by their competitors (ie. Velodyne). They also have built a fantastic team. They just acquired Sense Photonics (another digital LiDAR company) in an all stock deal that basically added 80 experienced engineers to their team and allowed them to form the Ouster Automotive division, they just announced a couple deals in the last couple weeks with Local Motors and Perrone Robotics to produce thousands of sensors for them through 2023 and potentially tens of thousands more by 2025, they recently added the CEO of Mercedes-Benz Trucks to their board of directors, and they just announced that they‚Äôve doubled the processing power of their new L2X chip. They‚Äôve met all of their goals for 2021 so far, and they currently have over 600 existing customers and around 300 existing patents. And last but not least I like that they‚Äôre focusing the majority of the business on the industrial sector rather than just the automotive sector like their competitors. Lidar has so many use cases outside of just Auto (ie. autonomous drones, autonomous mining equipment, autonomous factory equipment, 3D mapping, autonomous factory robot, and much more). I‚Äôve done a lot of research into $OUST, and I truly believe they‚Äôll be a success. Like I said tough, I could be wrong. Just my 2 cents.

Does the real estate stock meltdown have any implications for the housing market like I hope it does?
No. Zillow owned almost no houses, has absolutely no effect.
7000 Homes is a lot if it‚Äôs mainly In one state and might ruin a couple neighborhoods . If it‚Äôs 7000
Across every state then there will be no issue .

Long term though we will see a lot of people who over paid 50-100k like them selling at a loss
Or they will have negative equity for a very long time
Zillow owned <$2B of homes.

US housing market is >$40T.

There will be no effect. Zillow was not a major buyer, they were not driving home price increases - they were overpaying for houses they‚Äôre now selling at a loss!
Sure, but the other real estate stocks went down in tandem.
KB Home peaked 5 months ago - housing market still chugging along just fine.

VXX is almost guaranteed to pop within the next 2 weeks
What exactly am I looking at here?

Short Term Futures?

So if the market crashes....this goes up?
Yes, follows a certain volatility cycle. Spy is due for a pullback. If we go up on FOMC, we‚Äôre not at the VXX bottom yet. You could get probably at least a 25% move overnight when it goes up
Thank you for this...Interesting to take a look at it.

Going through the [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080715/etf-analysis-ipath-sp-500-vix-futures-vxx.asp)  right now to understand it more as best as I can.

Seems like something I want to be into as I am certain that this Market cannot keep going up the way it is, but also seems like a bit of risk hold due to being able to make money in other ways when it does flip. Comments?
When Spy goes down and this goes up, a lot of other things in the market will be on sale, having gone down with Spy. You take your profits and buy the dip on something else
In on it for the day...will see how it goes after the 1:30 announcement
If I was taking that trade, I would personally put a tight stop loss on it or DCA in, because I expect the market to go up on FOMC, which means you could potentially buy VXX lower. If people had legit fear of a pullback, VXX would‚Äôve already been going up. I don‚Äôt think the pullback is today. But you do what you feel comfortable with.
Understood. Truly appreciate the insight on this!

It was a 50/50 split with the VP tipping the balance. They lost Virginia last night to a republican challenger. Now they hold a majority.
That was a governor race
Which indicates ‚Ä¶ what? Come on buddy. You can do it. Use your brain.
Idk if you're joking or not. The governor doesn't vote on federal bills and the influence of the governor won't have a huge impact till the next senatorial race in that state
Right which is just around the corner. Investors will see this as a preview of things to come.
Are you from the US? Because if so our school system has majorly failed you in the ‚Äúhow our government works‚Äù department

Cold War had potential but SBMM is a thing and Vanguard is going to have it as well, multiplayer is fucked just bc of that and zombies looks like its going to be copypasted shit all the year bc they didnt have proper development time. Not a buy for me.

CALL OPTION NOOB

Sorry for the dumb question but just bought my first call option on SDC $7 Nov 12 (Earnings out on the 8th). So far up 42%, but my question is do I have to sell before to make a profit? Or if I do nothing at all and it goes over on Nov 12, will it automatically close and funds into my account? TIA!
First ones free. Sell it fool
If you don't sell and you have the funds your broker may exercise the call, meaning that you buy the shares for the strike price. Bit of advice, take profits sometimes +42% can go to -99% real quick
Now 21% ugh, growing pains. I'm still a believer it's about to blow.
Fuck missed ATVI dip

Nice! I probs sold that to you lol
I picked up some protective puts for earnings. Their past earnings performance has been trash.
Earnings dont matter they're always trash this is an FDA approval momentum play for me
Same but I wouldn't making a quick play with puts prior to fda. Fda approval in the next 2 weeks would not be the best for the puts but what is the chance of that and earnings in the same week? Like 4/52
I mean I'll probs get some 3.5 puts or 4 puts next week if it runs up just in case, I'm sitting on a $3k position in Jan 2022 calls the open interest on that chain is fucking nuts.
I too have some January calls. Bunch of shares too. This thing has incredible potential and approval seems like a sure thing.
Oh I have no doubt about approval, think 10 bagger at least, gonna wake up one morning it SENS will be up over 100%

It has to rebound. I don‚Äôt know if this week tho. Give it a month maybe. Sexual harassment scandal will pass and sorry to say, but it‚Äôs not going to affect the share price in the future.

RIOT is the play this week.

&#x200B;

OI on the call chain was mostly low delta at the beginning of the week.  Heavy, heavy daily shorting for the last two months.

&#x200B;

Bullish numbers on their October mining report.

&#x200B;

ER is 11/15 after hours (not 11/8 as still estimated on websites).

&#x200B;

Last chance to get in before it starts to retest ATHs of $79 by year end.  Assuming it makes up a good bit of that this week with the momentum of necessary buy-ins.

&#x200B;

Unlike MARA, their shelf offering is more than likely over and they are flush with cash ($600M from shelf).  MARA is probably announcing a substantial ($400M+) ATM equity raise in the next few weeks since they only have $20 million cash on hand.
They are diluted to hell my guy they aren‚Äôt hitting ath
Total outstanding share count (including executive shares issued after annual meeting) is probably around 125 million with the shelf offering closed.  And more than likely it has been closed for the last two weeks.

&#x200B;

Shelf cash of $600,000,000 plus $125,000,000 cash from 2Q21 ER plus approx. $250,000,000 in mined corn plus around $250,000,000 in real estate and hardware puts their book value at $1.2 Billion.  That's approximately $10 to $11 per share.

&#x200B;

They are cash flow positive.

&#x200B;

Their 200 MW of institutional lease agreements generate cash and, potentially, more corn.

&#x200B;

It is the most undervalued stock comparing it to peers on the market right now.

&#x200B;

Whinstone is basically an AWS of the corn mining world.  Rockdale, TX is the largest mining facility in the US and the US accounts for over a third of the world's hash rate.

&#x200B;

Edited to add: they recently (within the last two months) deployed 40 MW of self-mining capacity at Whinstone.  The other 50 MW of capacity is still leased through Coolmint, LLC.  Their margins are increasing while others are seeing a decreased margin due to rising energy costs.

&#x200B;

All aboard!
too many words just give me a strike and exp dammit
$33C 11/5 should print big.

&#x200B;

I have strikes at 33, 35, 36 and 39 all expiring this week and a more expansive suite of strikes for 11/19 after their ER drops the panties.

Bid/ask spread of 473C 11/5 fucking insane, like legit everyone wants the 473C
i think BBBY will end up at 30% on the day, its dumped at open because investors were scared of an share offering before the buyback, i think shorts will have to exit soon so their may be more room to run but vice versa if the buying dies the shorts might try weather the storm
FSLY yay or nay?

Anyone have any ideas for SPY tmrw? Today was supposed to be my hard red day so tmrw green?
> SPY is a very popular stock for trading. The price of SPY can be predicted by using technical analysis (TA). TA uses historical prices to predict future trends, like the direction and magnitude of changes in prices.
If Jpow says tapering starts, probably gonna be heavy red, tapering delayed, probably gonna trickle up until december

‚ÄúIf I put $SPY on your radar, and you did well, I‚Äôm genuinely happy for you. However, what is going on now ‚Äì there should be legal and regulatory repercussions. This is unnatural, insane, and dangerous.‚Äù

Michael Burry
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

if cathie bought zillow shouldnt we follow? i feel like she knows what shes doing
she massively underperformed SPY this year she sucks
Nobody tell him
She had one good year. A shit ton of money flooded into her funds from it and now she just buys every dip on every shit stock in the market. If she had just stayed highly concentrated in TSLA and not traded at all this year, her fund would have performed better. That‚Äôs negative alpha and from a portfolio management standpoint that means you‚Äôre dumb

Edit: plus she‚Äôs a bible humper, ü§Æ
Anybody entered bbby today?

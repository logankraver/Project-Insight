you'll regret downvoting and not buying puts
Up 175+% she‚Äôs reaching 360 tomorrow
Yes a ton of us have been saying that since it first started getting pumped
NET next trillion dollar company without earnings
Stocks R US
Sold Jan 135 calls when it broke 140 üôÉüôÉ
Imagine YOLOing TDOC at $290 on 2/15/21 thinking it was going to hit $450 EOY
Why is SOFI going nuts?
Nice Try Laundrie. we're after you.
$WISH is the worst F‚Äôn stock in the history of this game.
Lol I sold my 449s for a 30% loss too
I got 11/8 and 11/10 spy calls at 445, 450 up around 90% should I sell them?? Or let em run the rest of the week
Why? We're headed back to a new ATH, then worry about it
let's just say my student debts where payed off before you made yours.
Sometimes you just gotta buy a parabola so it can come down so you can buy more once it does.
interested to see what IYT and the russell do tomorrow
Said that about Tesla as I took profit 

Then it split into 4 


Then even those multiplied several times over what I sold the og stock for
Who woulda thought I should have inversed myself for the 100th time in a row?? It‚Äôs like I am the literal best at making wrong decisions.
üåàüêª

Hey man be happy with your profit. I'm holding these calls overnight like a retard.
Feeling like you're late af and too pussy to decide what to do for yourself.
Holy batman NET. Non stop green candles for two weeks
I actually bought $SPY $450 calls for 10/22 exp today at .35 a piece. I‚Äôm just going to hold because I know it‚Äôs got more room to run.
I'm not sure why but I upvoted this
lol NET 181 now. WTF this juggernaut is not stopping at all.
Anyone concerned spy up 15 points in a week with no significant pullback?
Oh yeah I think you can still get like 500$ strike calls. You should immediately buy as many as you can for Oct 22.
Sold at $90 thinking it's overvalued  ü§°
So how much more can Bros run. It‚Äôs been money.
$NET is the greatest tech stock. The best, absolutely tremendous stuff here. It‚Äôs a tech stock the likes of which the world has never seen before, believe me. Disagree? Sad! Go home to mommy okay byeeee
Top 10% of wealthy Americans own 89% of all US stocks. Holy shit , it‚Äôs to be expected but isn‚Äôt that wild to think about ?
Dis down 3% on a BS downgrade. 
Cramers shilling for it. 
Buy the dip
Need banks to moon this week
the fuck are you talking about look at SPY‚Äôs 5 day chart
wtf is a profit?
ah, damn. what'd you do to blowup your account on spy calls? for the last 6 months (minus the september dip), it was pretty much just buy and hold til exp. also, depending on your account size, i recommend considering spx or xsp instead of spy. better tax advantage, and you can settle for cash.
I love how you guys decide to jump on calls after they're like, up.
Looks like Puts at the close is the right play for tomorrow. Sorry bulls.
Bless up üôè 30: 10/22 452c &amp; 456c
MSTR already exists
[deleted]
Just make your kids go hungry instead.
I really sold my spy 450 calls for a $700 loss at the dip this morning‚Ä¶
Yeah, and the last time it hit 169, it popped back up the next morning. Let's hope for the best buddy.
Link or GTFO
Rule number one of SOFI gang. You do not talk about SOFI gang! Fingers crossed though..
Unreal
Tbh
NET is one of the most overpriced stocks I've seen in a long time. Not sure what's happening there but the crash is going to be pretty Epic
If you aren‚Äôt using the Reddit app on mobile, you will just see emoji numbers

Took a fair amount of profit today.  4 green days in a row.  Finally learning to take some profit rather than running my shit into the ground.
ROKU is finally coming alive after being dead for so long.
$SPY $450 tomorrow at open is the easiest money I‚Äôll make on calls all year.
My spy put is down 50% after today. Might as well just hold it til tomorrow
[deleted]
If these 10 months have been any indicator, anytime it falls below 170 its an instabuy. Its top however seems to be a bit less transparent though
Joe, it's Joe. Man, pick up. Come on Joe, it's Joe

SPY 10/22 447.50 you beautiful fuck \^\_\^ (edit: lolol 475 yeah ok)
That's what today was...Tomorrow might be bloody
Lucid gonna be $50 a share by January
I got out because the management is shady as it gets. Go look up their reviews on BBB. I would've jumped back in but I sold for like a $3k loss and didn't wanna get the wash sale
[deleted]
think BITO will have options?
I‚Äôm feeling bullish on AMD next week might get some calls
How we feeling about ROKU?
SPY the last few minutes has been crazy.  Red and green dicks flying everywhere.
Gamble
Well, buying the Disney dip at the floor is going well.
Sofi touched 21.  Just the tip then retreated.  My $20 strike price for December looking great
Together apes retarded
Did Robin Hood actually halt it or did the stock exchange
[deleted]
Good work
Imagine not having a valid reason to NOT buy SoFi üë∏üèªand still not buying‚Ä¶ market is still open!
I hope we open green so I can sell and then we crash hard af. Ahhh one can only dream
ROKU calls up 300% mother of hell

Dayum, NET up another 7%+. Crazy shit.
Thoughts on LULU? Holding Jan $450‚Äôs. Slowly trucking along
Spy is into happy endings
say whaaaaat
how dare robinhood halt trading on a stock i never bought 1 year ago during a once in a lifetime event, ROBINHOOD BAD!
I 3-d printed a time machine but I‚Äôm not sure how to turn it on

FUBO is Fubolous!!!

And that is...?
Big dicks in your ass is bad for your health

I'm surprised no one is talking about INTU ü§ëü§ëü§ë
You think RIOT and MARA fucking explode tomorrow with BITO going live?
SOFI $21.50 EOW Call, hoping I don't get totally fucked.
Rkt is a fuckin bum
Lots of NET talk in here.

I like the stock, but I‚Äôve learned to just inverse WSB for the long haul.

Taking my profits and will wait to re-enter, or find something else.
That was a pure act of desperation.
Sofi just on a crawl up and up. Fucking beast
TAKE ME OUTTTT
Just one. Just one good rally that doesn‚Äôt get ratfucked to death by robots. That‚Äôs all I ask. 

But we just can‚Äôt have that, can we?
profit is profit my guy, live to trade another day
i don't press submit on my trade until 15:59:58 EST
Ban them longer for thinking it was gonna do anything but crab sideways
Because with gme they were able to move the price and "hold the line". Its not the same with spy.
If it doesn‚Äôt set a daily ATH, it‚Äôs not $NET
It's not, dipshit.
my disney calls up 30% üôÇ
Gotta be kidding üòÇ
What about CHWY and BARK?
SPLTAGN
BAC will bounce back tomorrow
Can we just make the trading day like 1 hour long.  20 minutes of opening action, 20 minutes of nothing, 10 minutes of closing, then final 10 minutes to just be crazy assholes making the previous 50 minutes moot.

Can I revise my active bet? I miswrote it as 170
Euphoria is real. Hasn‚Äôt been this bullish for weeks
I got into progenity over the summer a little over 2$  like 2.11 in June and watched it rise top then made some money on its decline. I remember seeing it sub 1$ and was thinking it would really take off especially if its therapies got more approval but did not buy. I bought in after the first rally and really want to see how far it can go. Super weet. Speak the word.

Oops! All pumps
Green. Optimism is winning, and someone is aquiring big positions in the mega caps that boost the indexes like AMZN, APPLE, MSFT, TSLA. Also bonds and the dollar seem to be calming down.
üôè
still?
Considering it was double downgraded and down almost 8%, I give upstart a lot of credit to get back into the 380 area.  Low volume but good sign.
Spah creepin around here
I was in on this sub $1 and sold like 3 days before the rip. F
basically have my entire net worth massively short the ARKK complex. I have monetized almost all my hedges to stay level here. Either TSLA dies by eoy or I do

Decided to take a gander at TSLA options‚Ä¶ either yall have a lot of money or are buying very OTM with less than 1wte
Johnson &amp; Johnson calls or poots??
Thanks for making me feel a little better about my L. Good luck.
I‚Äôm warning this sub one last time, BNTX and MRNA will be back to their former glory very soon with earnings coming up. I warned you weeks ago on the dip, and I was mocked. We are up a good amount already, this is only the beginning for the two sleeping giants 

(Not financial advice)

Edit: the downvotes coming in already this is hilarious. I can‚Äôt wait when you tell me congratulations and fuck you in 3 weeks

tesla dump
I'm so flattered
[deleted]
anyone buying $spce jan 20$ calls?
Lol
Had a huge run. I think even if they have spectacular earnings they can tank because so many expectations have been priced in already. You have analysts revising upward before the numbers even come out. I‚Äôd be careful
Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

Both?
Thetagans squeezing the hell out SPY calls rn
It's only +5.15% in 1 month. Totally doable
I bought $442 puts thinking I saw spy starting to reverse around 11ish. Wrong
That new macbook has a fucking notch design lmao puts on aapl
So 10/22 700c?
No sweat. SPY has 1 month to increase +5.15%.

A very productive day staring at the 1min TSLA chart since open....
Cutting costs at the bottom is easier than actual effort. Why work hard when you can just increase profits every quarter by fucking over labor?
Obviously greed. You could ask the same question for almost every other mega Corp.
because people who play spy know they're degenerate gamblers, apes are delusional troglodytes

Can someone tell me what's the rationale for not increasing the wages for entry level workers, especially in the context of John Deere? I know the CEO and the VPs take a chunk of the profits, but I read somewhere that they have made ~4 bn in profits so far in 2021 (fact check me, I don't know if this is right, and I am too lazy to research), which is more that sufficient to pay the corporates and the entry level workers no?

Everything seems to be today, weird.  I don't think that makes for a good prognosis

Based on the fact that the first one is always free for newbies... I might have to jump into this as well
I have an exp next Monday and bought like a week ago so was referring to these past few days. I MIGHT sell if it gets real sweet these last 30 mins but honestly I have a wide enough cushion and will likely continue holding

Edit: I‚Äôm holding baby!
You will own a yacht by Friday
ya I checked again and my numbers were off, hasn't quite hit upper bolinger yet. Maybe I'll hold off on puts.
Nope. 150 EOY. People have been taking profits for the last 3 months. Now it‚Äôs close to ATH again with earnings coming up.
The downward movement is definitely an overreaction but I'm feeling fundamentals working against it is slowly bringing the upper channel down, so less room for growth. Especially since DIS hasn't held over 180 for a while
I heard they make up 75% of subway 'tuna' also

My 7.5C's are up 255%
Netflix earning quite enticing. Squid game was an unprecedented blockbuster that penetrated borders.

Their earnings have been stagnating for a while. They could post an unprecedented surprise here.

Then again stock ran quite a bit already.

Then again monthly chart looks rather coiled.

Buying amzn calls would proxy off Netflix earning win.

Also netflix literally has $net in it.
Just bought my first spy call 10/20 $449 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
He‚Äôs retarted
Cybersecurity stocks? My NET and CRWD are killing it
Deep OTM spy calls could pull a 15K bagger, really hope we‚Äôre $460 by Thursday. Dems better pass Build Back Better today. Likely IMO w/ 3.13 mil buy order at noon today
They don't make underwear in your size bro not their fault
Discover bank just sent me an ad for .5% interest on a 12-month CD if I deposit $25,000.

It's been flatter then my ex wife for 10 months, the fuck you want from this stock?
Probably goes +5% tomorrow after I‚Äôve sold
For 30 years the strategy has been to buy DIS when it drops. The mouse doesn‚Äôt fuck around
Is it normal to put a pillow on your back even on a Herman miller chair ?
Youre wrong bot boi

Up bigly on amd calls down bigly on aapl puts. I haven‚Äôt been profitable in almost 2 months bc I keep canceling out good trades with bad trades fuckkkk
You're in college? Name every college.
Look at the daily. RSI only at 59, so still plenty of room to run up. But I agree it's gone up pretty fast over the last couple of days so I wouldn't be surprised to see it stagnant or pulling back in the next day or two.
Hold onto yer butts
Me too here , when did you purchase?
I'm being an idiot with AMZN puts, exiting at 15% loss or at EOD.
HBI (hanes brands) Leaps‚Ä¶ most analysts have a price target of $22-$26

If PLTR actually goes to $300, it means they actually did become Skynet and start the great machine wars, making currency worthless eventually. Maybe I‚Äôll show my shares as evidence of my early fealty to the machines tho, so it‚Äôs a good investment ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Nothing but up, always lol
Went into FCEL shares instead of calls Friday. Depressing‚Ä¶
Guys get ready for earnings loss porn from people who don't understand IV crush after earnings
Any mad men swinging puts on AMD? I smell profit taking soon.
COIN
DKNG calls and sell at open
That'd make my day

Y'all remember ARKK 150 calls ü§°

INTC, probably selling calls since IV crush would fuck puts and it consistently dumps
Anything behind the MVST rip today? Or just doing what everyone else is doing?

Everyone but PLTR anyway.

Guess I‚Äôll fuck around with the dick &amp; dick Covid company earnings play
Your tinfoil hat isn't on right or else you'd have the answers.
You too pal
Telecoms are mega boomer. Least it isn't T
Actually hitler said it
Another day, another plate full of regrets about not buying TSLA calls
Unfortunately we're getting to that point in the real estate cycle where tjings are loosening up, we all have friends that we know how much they make and what their credit looks like, aka they have no business buying a $400k home, somehow buying that home and locking in that debt. Scary scary
Why the fuk am I holding 5 bags today???
Fuck you bot. !banbet SPY 0.01% 2 days
The fuck earnings plays are you degenerates playing
is buying calls on $t worth it now? thinking of getting jan 25 calls
all my gains got wiped out from holding COIN Calls for too long. greed is a bitch
Full send
It‚Äôs constant up and down lol. Probably smart to swing trade
Hold onto baba calls or naw?

Completely agree!!
Because normies don't give a shit about the controversy
Spending too long thinking about buying DIS calls instead of just pulling the fucking trigger.  No one keeps the mouse down for long.
just curious, if I'm already on the spectrum, does the vaccine undo the autism?
You're not the good kind of special are you?
Why buy when you can rent?
You fucked up your format - you want **!banbet SPY +2% 1d** or **!banbet SPY 500 1w** or **!banbet GME 0 1d I'll eat a bar of soap**
Sell for sure before earnings. Then IV will crush, even if you are on the right direction it may end being cheaper than now.
if applebees is so bad why is there one in every city i go to
TSLA gonna surpass its ATH closing price of 883 today imo

Narrator: He had no idea what was coming.
He could have wagered becoming a millionaire many times over buying puts, but no: he did it just for WSB clout.
Bought SPY 443c 11/10 expiry on Friday.  I‚Äôm up 43%.  Sell on green now or hold out for some irrational % gain that will never come?
I think you underestimate the age spread here
Man I'm quickly getting back into the mindset of making stupid hyper speculative plays because I start thinking I can do no wrong.

This is how I ended up bagholding so much BB, COIN, and ARKK. Someone stop me.
LCID looks interesting. Run back to 28 this week?
I'm in college, \~75% of everyone at my university uses a Mac, iPad, or both. Apple legit won't ever stop making money. Why isn't its stock price present value of what it would be worth in 1000 years

Hey what's up with all the new bots on twitter today that are using tickers and quoting something either bullish or bearish, then included in the tweet is a photo of what they just tweeted?

When he approached me I said ‚Äúsure I‚Äôll give you a dollar, but first do you have a joke for me?‚Äù I was going to give him a dollar regardless but wanted a laugh. 

He paused and thought for a second. Then he said ‚ÄúWISH used to be $10. Can you believe that?‚Äù I fell out of my chair laughing and gave the man my whole wallet.

Whoever downgraded Disney doesn‚Äôt enjoy the plethora of milf ass that roams wild and free there and must prefer zac effron üÖ±Ô∏èUssy.

Don‚Äôt gamble money you can‚Äôt afford to lose please

Finally a book that checks in üòÇ

For the LOVE OF GOD APPLE. WHY GO BACK TO MAGSAFE!?
Macy‚Äôs closing stores all over the past few years and stock rockets up. Checks out
Sour hour plz
Holding TSLA calls past today?? Whatta rip
CRSR hitting 25 today? 
who buying this dop?
Okay but which was the better movie; Gladiator or Troy?

While I feel Gladiator was a deeper and more emotional movie, I could watch Troy more often.
The market look weak, acts sick, big boys sneaking out the back exits, you have been warned.
2 $450C 10/20
30 $456C 10/22
30 $457C 10/22

Should print hard
I make a good 400 bucks off the trade, this morning SPY was around 443.80-444.  I also immediately bought calls and sold at when it was 445.  Now I'm about to buy puts again after such a sideways day

My earnings are scheduled pre-market.
Got to be honest, this price action on SPY last three days isn't trustworthy
Yeah, which is why I didn't recommend it. FCEL is hitting an interesting level for a potential long through PH. PROG also, perhaps.
I‚Äôm going calls 450 OTMs fuck it this is absurd
Same. Sold my AMD and NVDA calls and waiting for a dip this week
In the past 3 weeks:

Tekton torque wrench.  Arrived clearly used, and the lever that switches from loosening to tightening was broken.  Return.

SanDisk thumb drive.  I bought this as a warehouse deal, saying the box was damaged.  As somebody who drove a palletjack a lot in my younger days, this was clearly run over by a pallet jack or fork truck.  Tire marks and all.  Drive was entirely flattend and smashed.  Not even close to usable.  Return.

Liftgate strut for my Hyundai.  Went to put it on, way too long.  Amazon said it fit a 2013, checking the manufacturer website it's only for models up to 2010.  Return.

2/3 of those were brand name.  None of them are the fault of the manufacturer or fake reviews.  Amazon is likely struggling to hire and train fast enough.
Cash it after the next pomp.  Watch the volume/RSI, sell when RSI hits 70
Is there no floor upon which MRK will let me rest my bags?
Man, this NET run up is nice, really debating cashing it out though and seeing if it pulls back at all
The amount of sophie supporters worries me.

Goddamn 1999 for a laptop. Fuken insane.
They been in shambles for years.  Every chip they've released since 2015 has been 33% inherent design-performance gains and 66% sacrificing headroom.  Their latest chips are binned so aggressively that they have no headroom at all.

If they had any sense, they'd've discontinued the 'K' class overclockable processors 2 years ago so people wouldn't catch on.  But no, management and marketing is so divorced from engineering (what's left of it) that they still haven't realized that they're selling 'overclockable' chips that break when you boost them by 0.1 MHz.

The only real question, and it's a big one, is when the market will catch on.  Biden didn't help, invited INTC bigwigs to sit at a roundtable and came out with a whitepaper how American chip manufacturing is suffering and must be propped up at any cost.  Notably absent among American chipmakers: AAPL, QCOM, AMD, NVDA, and also TSM, LAM and Samsung who, while foreign, export a majority of their product to the US.  It's Lee Iacocca and the tax-supported K-car all over again.
Time to get out and find stocks that actually makes money. Only invest in PLTR if you are a millionaire that is satisfied with a 25% annualized return.
Disney might be nice for a few months out

All these bears crying. I like my meat medium rare
I thought a premise in your argument was that the fed would prop up the market.

Anyway, "theta strategies" really means being an insurer for market makers against price movement, where the expected return is either slightly negative (you're basically borrowing from the market) or slightly positive (the gap between realized and implied volatility), and there's _huge_ variance in returns. The issue is that the distribution of returns--lots of small wins with huge losses when every position you're in starts correlating tightly--leads gullible people like OP to think maybe it's a good idea. Better to just be honest that you're gambling and buy lotto tickets.

These are the worst of times, these are the bes.....worst of times, these are the be....worst of times, market crash. Been warned!
AXSM taking a breather today. Just south of flat on the day after that monster eight point week off the $32 level.

The news is still trending great for the company. They placed ads for account managers to handle the rollout of the much anticipated FDA approval of AXS 05, which should come at any time now to January. That's gives folks ample opportunity to get in on this expected 4X return on cash or 8X on margin.

Company also today announced an increase to their credit line, most likely related to expenses for the rollout.

When this stock gets approval it should surge. And I mean SURGE higher. We already closed above and held $35. The blasted right off  to $40. Expect to see $50 way before next month options. And fahgettabahtit when the approval comes in. No stopping until $100 and beyond.

Good luck.

Been holding PLTR since last year. Basically flat. Is this stock ever going to take off, or is it time to get out?
Why is everyone hoping SPY crumbles? Wtf is wrong with y'all?
Steak, eggs, and orange juice for late breakfast.
I'd probably wait a few days. It will probably tank further considering how hard it tanked today. Seems like there's a lot of momentum behind it.
Yes, yes I have
Thanks bud. I was joking about the financial solvency but I certainly would like it to go up
Why is everyone wearing masks?
Too bad that I'm dampening my good stock gains with my garbage option play losses. There's no reason to trade options really unless you're doing some weird covered call selling or shit like that

As scammy as that stock is, it's a meme stock and it will always go back up to the 30s at some point. One positive news catalyst and it's an easy 10% day.
In the last 6 months, SPY has had 12 outside days (days where it hits a higher high and a lower low than the previous day). It has closed down the following day 9 of those 12 times. I'll take a 75% chance of an ATM put making me some money tomorrow.

\* EDIT: Today is one of these outside days. Kind of an important detail to leave out.

\* EDIT 2: The three times when it finished up the next day were a Thursday, a Thursday, and a Monday (4/22, 5/6, and 8/22). Doesn't look like there's a correlation there or any special Monday effect.

You would wouldn't you.
Spreads work in a bull market, a flat market, and even a bear market (up to 10% correction in this example). Even then you can roll them if you believe the correction will eventually bounce back. Pure calls only work when the market goes up and if it doesn‚Äôt go up enough you lose. More importantly why even take the risk if the only goal is 12% every six months? That‚Äôs his stated goal and chump premiums will do just that

Sounds out of my budget unfortunately. But very cool
I‚Äôd be in the back seat getting blazed.. it‚Äôs probably a good thing I drive a 97 jeep
Sometimes I just sit and wonder if I have any intrinsic value, or am I simply worthless at expiration?
Wait until Thursday open but if I knew I‚Äôd be rich
Hard to believe. which contract?
Sell those, buy same number of OTM calls and hold through INTC ER.

Exactly. I thought it was underpriced as demand was going to kick up with limited ability to reinvigorate supply. Ding ding.

Honestly I think the move this week is hold these TSLA FDs till about 3PM Weds, then sell at a peak and convert the proceeds into shares for earnings
ok at this point just teleport to 450 and vaporize my puts to -100%. I accept my fate

Pro-tip if you want a cheap gaming setup: buy a cheap lightweight netbook, get yourself the fastest possible internet connection (because this method will require the lowest possible latency), and then learn how to set up an NVidia Gaming instance on Amazon AWS. Cloud gaming is massively underrated, you won't even need to worry about overheating issues or portability, and you're still the owner of your badass VM.
Oh got you, yeah saw tons of those idiots last year lololol.

&gt; Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar cut his rating on Disney to 'equal weight' from 'overweight', and lowered his price target by $35 to $175 per share, noting the group's growth story appears to be weakening heading into the final months of the year.

Tread carefully. Mouse goes anemic when someone makes fun of his Plus numbers. There also appears to be large put sweeps for December
I'm going to stop making banbets with the same strike and expirations as my positions. I take a loss and then get fucked by VisualMod
amd to ATH ?
I don listen to Olivia rodrigo
You fucked up your format - you want **!banbet SPY +2% 1d** or **!banbet SPY 500 1w** or **!banbet GME 0 1d I'll eat a bar of soap**

New colors for HomePod mini. I feel bad for $AAPL gang.
tbh they've always been playing catch up to their competitors.  Apple Ecosystem is very easy to get sucked into though.
our earbuds deliver sound directly to your ears lmao.
Lol, honestly impressive to buy the top today, you would have had to wait so long. You gotta jump in at open man, that‚Äôs when the action happens! I had already bought puts, sold them for a loss, and then bought calls by ten minutes after open today

Apple: ~~innovate~~ iterate
Apple, just stop talking. You're tanking my calls.
Like I said, I haven‚Äôt been following you around. You post all the time, of course people are going to comment on your posts. I‚Äôll chill with the negativity on your stuff.
The market is about patterns. One pattern I've noticed is the bears come out to play with slightly red futures, only to end up in shambles when the markets open. Every. Single. Time.

Apple should fire whoever makes these annoying sound effects

Wtf. Did Apple just put a paywall in using voice prompts for music?  Donkey ball shit
Sad little bear. It's still bull time
Bruh you're gonna be upset about that when the merger is approved. I sold my AMD leaps on the last run-up too and got back in at the 100 level last Monday. Back up to 125% on the leaps

$TSLA EPS expectation is $1.52. Last year same period was $.76. That is 100% growth expected. 

Let that sink in.
Wow tim thanks for the Siri plan!!! REVOLUTIONARY
WTF IS $CAR
is it meant to compete with spotify?
Apple same laptop with new charger

Just ordered an iPhone 13 pro, hoping AAPL tanks so my puts can pay for it.
Did AAPL really just put a paywall on voice prompts
Amen to that brother
Lmao they‚Äôre acting like ‚Äúusing your voice‚Äù is some amazing new concept, puts on Apple.
Microsoft will probably overtake Apple today and I will cry

More subscriptions lol
CHGG is finally coming to life
I heard they were going to launch a streaming service where like, it was free, but they played ads, and people would choose the music you listened to based upon a genre or something. Really wild.
AAPL puts tf was that
Well looks like the calls I bought at 171 exp fri might not be good lol
If I win we'll share a pie. If I lose I'll buy two. You hit me with one and share the other. If you run away I won't tell you any accounting facts.

Does apple really have a studio in their HQ? or is that a video set?
Then block me. Stop following me around w ur negative comments
seems like they are dumping on themselves so far.
WOOF babies we eatin
&gt; Apple is a company that makes computers and phones. They also make music players, but they are not very good at it.
168ish
Fuck yeah sell the 1080ti and go get gaped on a new 30 series
This music selection make me want to buy puts

Meanwhile I bought a 1660 for like $250 in 2020 and it plays most games at max settings at 1440p 120hz.
Any hope for DIS this week?
Lol go for it. I‚Äôm not going out of my way to troll you, you‚Äôve just been getting on my nerves lately.
Nothing like buying SPY calls at the top and being down 12% over the span of an hour. What a great way to start the week.
Yes
playlists, this is revolutionary, what will Apple think of next.
What‚Äôs the floor on dis jeez
The volume says it will also be a 2022 ‚Äòthing‚Äô too
&gt; Apple is a company that makes computers and phones. They are not a bank, so they don't have any money to give you.
$FCEL baby! Let‚Äôs go!
Holy shit I might have timed well some $NVDA puts I added a few minutes ago. That shit will help me hedge my $TSLA call tendies against tech-related risks this week.
Almost 100%, sounds like nothing special so far.
Wait a second Apple wants us to send them B******?
Historically a good bet.
Wil get out of the puts by eod or tomorrow. Think rest of week slightly green. Think we are correcting after that. Will see
when tesla goes to 1000, thanos will snap his fingers and every tesla short will turn to dust.
Looking forward to the AAPL dump today
It‚Äôs pure comedy how much of this sub is still convinced the market is going to crash and are buying puts. Spy ~6.5% drop from ath and Facebook 15% drop and y‚Äôall still think it‚Äôs going down despite all technicals turning bullish last week ü§°üêª
Yea I know I was up and walked away for 5 minutes and it was gone
Hope not
Apple events are about as boomer as I gets.
Was in on puts heavy friday, took a huge loss.. I am into calls now up a little but idk at this point.
You could just try puts again
You think Tim Apple is a top or bottom

Someone talk me out of Tesla Calls. I tried puts last week and I got annihilated.
This guy looks like he got his haircut from medieval times.
FCEL make my pp going boing
Hahaha this Apple event intro is even worse than the last!
Says the guy who bought more puts at 446.
Someone just bought 4k worth of 456C 10/22 so I bought more
You do realize you actually don‚Äôt know that, that‚Äôs just an assumption
BB and bag holding, name a more iconic 2021 duo.

It‚Äôd be nice if NFLX dumped around 5% tomorrow
you realize that put OI indicates hedging, right?
Gonna regret not selling Apple earlier
Apple event starting now
Mark this post, GME may touch 188-190 one more time, but it will then return back down to the mid to low 170s and approach the 200MA. After that, it will jump past 250, maybe even past 300, in a matter of a week or two

/u/sereneturbulence (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to -4.0 when it was 438.56 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Time to double down hard on weed stocks or dip out? These prices are so insanely low but feels like legalization could be coming with an election cycle and the gov needing a win. Thoughts?
Probably buy carbon credit futures early or something.  Whatever it is assume we will do the bare minimum to reach the goal
China trade looking good for this week
Stranger things was as big during first season
Forced to because other govs were swing trading options. Not a good look, so nobody gets to play anymore.

Either the deal is called off and dkng goes up, or if the deal is formally dealt to Entain, the stock would probably go down more to price in the increase in certainty for dilution.

FB I hate your website but I love calling on you right now.
My bringing up Trump is just because you‚Äôre harping on Biden Admin painting a rosy picture. Meanwhile Trump called the top several times by saying stupid shit that wasn‚Äôt true - perfect example ‚Äústock market starting to look very good to me‚Äù lmao

And again, you‚Äôre probably right about the economy and real world impact. But I‚Äôm not investing based on what will happen in the real world, I‚Äôm investing based on what will happen in the stock market

I don‚Äôt like it. And your attempt to bring up Trump was bullshit. Real people are hurting.

Acknowledging that something so fundamental to being has a large portion of it determined by social construction makes people have to grapple with a great many more questions, and many people don‚Äôt want that, they‚Äôve learned the rules of this game and are determined to play it.

Making the same comment multiple times proves you don‚Äôt think so
AXSM reversing higher after foolish selloff to start the day. Company announced increase in credit line and ignorants sold it down nearly three  bucks not realizing the significance of the news.  


AXSM last week listed multiple postings for account managers for their AXS 05 drug that has not yet been approved by the FDA. So why hire? Because it's pretty much expected the approval to come in soon. The increase in the credit line is most certainly for marketing, production and all the expenses associated with rolling out a multi billion dollar blockbuster drug.  


This opportunity will not be around forever. Approval of AXS 05 may well launch AXSM deep towards the high ranges of analyst targets, which is above $150. That's right, this stock is probably a 4X gainer, which is why I bought more today on the dip just after the open.  


Good luck folks, I'm long shares.

Also, please by on standy during the board meeting in off chance that the board members actually read the one slide you helped on, but lets be honest, they probably won't.

In all seriousness though, 56k is great. Don‚Äôt take unnecessary risk when it comes to investing, diversify your portfolio in stocks you believe have a future ahead. And last but not least, the world is constantly changing bro. I don‚Äôt know which career path you are currently on but just remember that a lot of shit went down in the beginning and during the pandemic. If you  enjoy what you are doing, it is all good and you have no need to worry. Also keep saving up money every month, don‚Äôt try to impress anyone with flashy things but instead invest it and keep building your portfolio.

This is an epic run up to something, but who gives a fuck. Printing money!!
Coin to $300 today or tomorrow
The plot is dumb and the characterisation is kind of weak, but what was good was 1. great art direction &amp; music, and 2. really capturing the emotions of people as they face instant death.
Those who kept buying poots the last months can answer you... if they're still alive.
I'm looking forward to it. I thought somewhere SOFI said they thought approval would come in or before November. Possible UPST is also lifting SOFI with its crazy run. SOFI could go to around 35 I believe to match UPST market cap.
They don‚Äôt call them light pools

I'm gonna chalk this one up as a win for you. Well played.
TSLA puts? Or is it calls?
Yes, that's still a decent amount. I'd periodically DCA into $SPY no matter if it drops or moons, that way you won't have to worry about your retirement.

Also, if you aren't satisfied with your diploma, you can always go back to university (you can afford it, you're still 26) and get another one in a field you like &amp; has the potential to earn you more, consider that too as an investment.

Volume is too heavy. More of a pump then a natural rise.
I actually bought some right before the big drop two weeks ago, but bought a few more at the bottom and even the ones from before the drop are all green now thankfully.  Ya, glad I held on through the first day or two last week.  I should probably sell...

Yes. If I sell any position now, or I earn any amount of money for a job, it's worth X today. That same X gets you less with increased inflation. It's the same for anything worth a dollar amount. 

  
It's all contextual.
I don't even know what their website is. I just like the ticker.

SPY shares are worth a specific value, ‚ÄúX‚Äù. 



When we describe it‚Äôs value in terms of dollars we might say SPY is worth $446 per share



Now what happens when inflation creeps in? Now a dollar is worth less than a dollar was last time we checked. SPY, however, doesn‚Äôt lose value - so it is still worth ‚ÄúX‚Äù per share. Now if we want to describe how much ‚ÄúX‚Äù is in terms of dollars in order for it to still be worth ‚ÄúX‚Äù it must be worth more dollars.

APES TOGETHER STRONG
How do you feel about those pill vaccines?  The one ticker I'm in is below the min market cap so I won't mention it.
AMD hasn't done anything yet so your doubt was not wrong.  Only the stock price has risen on speculation.

It's just speculation in all tech stocks thinking there's no chance they can have bad earnings reports.
Go SOFI gooooo
The market came back to cover my most retarded moves ever.

The market cares.

If SPX closes above 4470 that should be the nail in the coffin for our September pullback.

i watched money heist in Germany two summers ago when my buddy that lives there showed me it on a visit. Disneys mono-culture (USA-centric content) will be its demise. Everyone in the fucking world hates America, yet for some reason every economy across the globe will continue to not build up their media industries while living in this digital world, just sucking Mickey Mouse's anti-semitic dick? Recognizing that paradigm shift back in 2015-ish(?, maybe earlier, i forget), was the defining point of separation. Nflx gets the best content from every single culture, Disney+ has a dividend! oh wait...

But noodles are good.
It went down after u said that xD glad i got puts
Look at the chart, it's a purely technical trade. I shorted $JD when it hit resistance today, the RSI is also too high, it's poised for a dump.
Good
I agree but my calls fuckin printing

Have experienced this before on AAPL calls and it's one stock I won't buy them on again, keeping it to shares only due to the slow moves.
Baby boy dip - $448 after lunch. Minor dip tomorrow.
Can someone please explain the run SPY is on? Really trying to convice people there won't be any downside to a nearly 2 year pandemic?
We should just annex the islands in the Caribbean and have them become the next set of US states. We could probably buy Venezuela on the cheap right now too.
Corn is pretty neat tho
Go look at a chart of an index - any chart of any index. You may notice that ***STONKS ALWAYS GO UP***




Every dip is just a bear trap over the right time interval, so just BTDF
All they need is an another test flight and bam 20% run again
New AirPods would be nice
Bers, when will you finally get that the US equities market is BY CONSTRUCTION bullish? Call it rigged, detached from reality or whatnot, NO ONE CARES. The occasional flash crashes over the past decades were there for the mega rich to load up on cheap stocks. Bers trying to time a rare market crash will get slaughetered and $SPY is going to keep going up bigly.

Can SPY just go ahead and hit $450 today so I can sell these 0DTEs calls for hookers and blow type levels of money?
ZS $300 is free money
Thats what I mean. Dip early delusional bulls buy the dip and we break even the rest of the day.. They're going to ride that for aslong as it works. I'm not a bear or a bull cause I'm not demented
Was JPOW bullish on his trades?
Of all the gyna companies to pick gotta be the worst to short

Their targets are always after the stock has already made a big move and it‚Äôs just to cover their ass bc the idiot had a 45 price rating when it‚Äôs now at 20. They‚Äôre lagging indicators

Only 2 hours in and my spy calls are up 400% but it‚Äôs too bad I only put in $500
Paper handed my 0dte SPY. Sold 40/50 contracts to cover my cost basis.  Now 10 contracts are up 220%. Could have had so much more money.
meat so expensive now. I don't remember buying steak or bacon since they jacked up prices since COVID. even restaurant takeout, $15 a meal. I feel guilty just for wanting to eat something decent. fuk

Cut your losses on your puts fam.
Ghost in the machine over at Zillow
She didn't reveal anything new tho. She's not really "whistleblowing", she's revealing stuff that anyone could have found with a quick google search.  Last year facebook dropped almost the same amount bc of the exact same reason. still outperformed spy.

These analysts and their useless price targets. 3 months ago he thought SPCE was worth 45 now 3 months later it‚Äôs 15. Okay
A SPY run on fucking what?! What fucking news broke that starts this? And don‚Äôt say earnings cuz you know damn well that shits ACTUALLY priced in

"Close" the options by selling one to open a spread. Helps to control theta while riding over night. Referred to as a ghetto spread. There's some good posts on this if you search the WSB boards.

No point in rolling it out. Dont see Sofi going back under $18 anytime soon unless it gets denied a bank charter. Buy to close and dont do CC's on Sofi anymore.
Snap tards .. switch to TWTR it's growing faster than ever
Look at the 10:57 AM Buy on CLOV. Massive green spike. Institutional buy maybe getting in for an expected run up to earnings?

Every day I become more confident that we're witnessing the set up for the greatest coordinated robbery of retail investors of all time.

You‚Äôre welcome, it‚Äôs funny the downvotes I am getting for this strategy
Also, pay more attention to the one star reviews. A product could be 99.9% 5 stars but one well written 1 star can tank the entire thing.
I bought TSLA at $61 as a goof and I don't think I can ever sell them now
Adding $BA to the list of tickers I will never trade again.  That list currently consists of $BA, $AMD, and $DIS
I saw that ban bet. He meant to put 451.8. Best part is he still would have lost.
I won my banbet but pussed out and sold my RIOT 10/22 30cs this morning. I still lose
I‚Äôm loving this live update from VisualMod
Spy is about to shoot through the roof on earnings reports.
Don‚Äôt be surprised *WHEN* SPY breaks ATH this week
whats up with DNN? Up 10% today
how are you gays playing earnings this week?
It just does. All the time for no fucking reason. But a 5% up day tomorrow isnt even out of the question so might as well hold
SNAP not waiting until earnings to collapse.
Authorization/approval OK
I sold Tesla. Important to know other ev companies are going to beat at least catch up to Tesla soon
Honestly prob for the best. I use RH too and I‚Äôm setup on TD and Fidelity‚Ä¶. I just don‚Äôt have holdings on those apps or approved for options yet. Gotta take the plunge
It's pretty crazy how when I do my own research and don't just skim bootleg DDs from here, the stocks I buy actually go up
Brainard is going to print even more. At least the market should crash before she starts printing and then I can ride the wave back up. I‚Äôm all cash now
I dumped most of my portfolio during the first scare. I'm not confident enough yet to start throwing money back into the market.
eua is not for approval; it's authorization - that's literally what the A stands for in E U A.

Why did it tank like that?
What time is BITO trading?
Just bought a lot of Crtx dec 185c. They were too expensive before but someone sold a lot of calls today probably because Crtx at highest iv of all stocks before open and price went down a lot. Yah I‚Äôll probably lose it all, but if their results are good this might be worth 1k or more. Results nov 11 or earlier it would seem.
$446 eeeoooooo

I bought calls literally 15 minutes before amc ran like $5 about a week or two ago and I made 1k off of $150 so I was like fuck it Imma take the ban just to make sure I keep this 1k, plus its only 90 days so I was like I‚Äôll just take the hit
And Market doesn‚Äôt care
Why buy lambo wen 96‚Äô civic gud too?
Preferably go up

Man, I agree. It just seems so dirty. But if they were question about it, they would just say that they feel like the market is a real bargain right here so that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre buying. They would never in 1 million years admit that they hold it up so they can make more in fees. And so that their billionaire clients don‚Äôt leave them. And take their money out of the market.

$250 in 10/29 puts and $250 in 10/29 calls +-$100 OTM for Amazon earnings is a no brainer. Copping these 3:59 10/28. One will print and the contracts are dirt cheap for high reward

But what ban bet would that be ?

I want to resist crypto, but its just a fucking juggernaut. COIN is fucking spittin again
Yahoo finance is recommending NFLX as a buy ahead of earnings, so clearly we should buy puts.  But they are so damned expensive!

Not if you were to just buy 0DTE on those days as well. THINK.
Oh yea trading on feelings always works. Might as well do TA

That's good, being scared means you're not gambling and thinking about what you're doing.  It's when you start YOLOing you're in trouble
Wait for this dip. Printer being turned off soon. JPow will be a single term chair
I personally want to get in on Steel before earnings but don't want to exit my current positions so I say that.  Huge dip and not quite clear on what the market is thinking.  If demand for steel has somehow been hurt it isn't showing in the price ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Index match is such a shitty convoluted formula -.-
Hell yeah. COIN crushing it every fucking day now üí™üí™üí™

What is the context on this? Is this what you expect SPY to drop to?
You misspelled Tesla. Apple gonna reveal some big Tesla shit today.
How many times do I need to be shown this fucking AMZN registered nurse ad? FFS I GET IT

Yeah, it's like watching a creepy clown on a tricycle being followed by a red balloon. Sure there is nothing strictly wrong about that but its deeply unsettling nonetheless.
I bought some at 446 closing Friday and sold on the open today, then immediately bought calls which I just sold.  Just gotta learn to play the game it zigs and it zags

It's a bull market, if you see a dip, buy calls. 

Learned that by losing half my portfolio being a bear
Would be cool if SPY went red today so I can go all in calls EOD.
Why did snap die?
Let me be very clear. I do not respect the sec
I‚Äôm half cash. Now what ?
Everything around me is Mac and I would never say some shit like that
We got about 10 days until earnings. There is a run up somewhere, possibly beginning this week. The event may actually be bullish.

Casually buying oil calls like a degenerative retard.
OMF calls looking tasty
Wrong Powell
My question as well.  Flip a coin I guess.
I mean just by the initial dip of the day, everyday. This only goes up.
Are people really expecting Tesla earnings to be good? How are they gonna hit delivery targets with all the shortages
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Disagree, I think that rates going up will trigger the catalyst for the recession but we have yet to peak. May 2022 pending true logistic issues.
I want to say this is the top for tesla before the earnings dump but I really doubt it
JPOW selling = bullish !!
There is something deeply unsettling about a market trying to rally when China data is bad and US manufacturing shrinks when it was expected to expand. Especially in a week where Jerome is speaking after inflation beat target.

Cathie fucked me for 6 months, there was no teasing at all.
Same as always. It will appear to be smol pp, but earnings will reflect that it was in fact, a big pp.

I am not sure about buying puts‚Ä¶ but cashing in calls could be wise!
Any ideas on what QQQ is going to do by Friday? I feel like earnings week this week is going to fuck it up.

I wonder if I was better off holding gme and theta ganging it instead of selling at $350. Like the lV on weeklies have been insane all year and earnings options were going for like $20-$30 for deep otm calls
Yes, they're announcing the apple car.

Scared money don‚Äôt make money.
TSLA puts require balls of titanium. Hold and you'll have your day. When it finally does eat shit and drop 200 bucks over a week, don't be greedy and keep holding because the next move is always pump 250 bucks slowly over the next 6 months.

CNBC needs to bring on one of these hedge fund managers buying NET onto their shows and ask what NET does.

NET is a great cloud-edge company (probably the best right now, outperforming FSLY handily), but they did not go from being a $25 billion company to a $55 billion company in the past 2 months.

&gt; McDonald‚Äôs is the largest fast food chain in the world. It has over 36,000 locations and serves 69 million customers daily. The company was founded by Richard and Maurice McDonald in 1940 as a barbecue restaurant located near San Bernardino, California. In 1948 they reorganized their business as a hamburger stand using production line principles. Businessman Ray Kroc joined the company as a franchise agent in 1955 and subsequently purchased the chain from them shortly thereafter; he then oversaw its worldwide growth until his death in 1984

If you played the gap fill on SPY like I said in this thread around 9:20am you would have more than doubled your money as the calls have gone from $45 at open to around $105 each right now (SPY 10/18 445c). The UPST play is around even right now but it should fill the gap a bit more.

Truckers complaining that the unionized crane operators making $200-250k per year are purposefully milking this supply crunch. Crane operators taking 2 hour lunches without staggering schedules so entire ports shut down for hours at a time.  Working extremely slow where it can take hours to get a single container for a truck. Any trucker who complains is sent to the back of the line where it can take days just to get cargo.  Can we get the Mafia to bust up the ridiculous sandbagging crane operator unions who make a quarter million dollar salaries and who are  fucking our margins this earnings season?

I mean, In the end this is a novel virus. Novel as in the first time. We don‚Äôt understand this yet truly, and it will be a while before we do. Could he have died from the vaccine? Very likely, he was healthy. Like healthy healthy and still died after receiving the shot. People should 100% get the shot if they feel as if they need to for themselves or their loved ones. But my point is that there are so many things we don‚Äôt know about it, and it ts very clear there are side effects that lead to hospitalization or death from the vaccine. 4,100 people out of 300,000,000 is not a lot of people. So I don‚Äôt think everyone should be worried about the side effects, but is it not reasonable to have the worry there? That‚Äôs why I say, if you need it, get it. If you don‚Äôt think you do, then don‚Äôt get it.

Don't put any text after the time token (1m, 1w, 15d) if you don't intend to carry out an interesting punishment to get unbanned early.
Do you lie to me
Lmao ü§£
I want to get tesla calls but can it really get up to 900+ in 2 days?
!banbet SPY 451 1 week
On which timeframe? I don't see h&amp;s anywhere on SPY
At this rate probably next week.
At least he said it during this massive run up- just noticed your other 10% drill comment.
Literally the first sentence of the article you posted proves you wrong 

#‚ÄùCathie Wood-led Ark Invest on Monday lowered some of its exposure in Coinbase‚Äù
It's transitory so enjoy while it lasts
Nah, you're citing the number of reports of people who died within 30 days of getting the vaccine. That's not the same thing as "the vaccine killed this person."

The actual amount of people who have died *from* the vaccine in the US isn't really known exactly, but it's definitely an absurdly low number. 

There will always be some vaccine complications, even with basic vaccines like MMRs. Allergies, irregular immune responses, etc. But the risk is incredibly low, and waaaaaaaaaay more healthy people are dying of, you know, covid.
FUCK CORSAIR
I miss them. I loved the tree faces lawn decor

Well guys all I can figure is all these other countries raising their interest rates make the market think our time is coming soon. So maybe a dip today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

How can you sell the news on Apple car when no one expects it? I'm giving you insider info , Apple car announcement is an easy 10% pump.

Edit: Tesla perma bear but good hit none the less bro! I've reloaded my puts....
Were you able to flip them though? If the call went up, then the shares should have been worth more than $14k.
Why would they buy at the top? They're not part of WSB
Did you walk into the office and give them cash? Because if you mean an ACH then you should have wired it in if you want the full amount on a Monday
Then seeing that would be magical, not sad.

Source for my girlfriends cousin dying from the vaccine? No. Source for people dying from the vaccine, sure i can pull some up. CDC says 4,100 Americans have died after receiving the vaccine. To be honest, my girlfriend is Mexican and her family is based in Mexico. So the cousin that passed was In Mexico and received a shot inside Mexico. Could that have been the reasoning? Bad medical practice there? Idk. But the fact remains that healthy individuals are passing away after reviving the shot.
Or people don't need to spend money on a car when they got one
Correct 

I bought calls in my account and also made this bet here

This bet here you get nothing except a win added to your record I'm now 1-0

Yes
Do I sell off my remaining TSLA shares to buy weeklies?
Probably going straight back down to that 298/300 support range
We have that already. It‚Äôs just mostly done offshore.
I can't afford a house to charge it at. Also can't afford a Tesla

I got 3 gas guzzlers and I‚Äôm gonna drive them until they fall apart - then buy a Tesla when it‚Äôs half the current price

At this point though, why does it have to be vaccine or no vaccine? Shouldnt we be testing for anti-bodies instead?  I'd feel safer having an unvaccinated nurse who had covid 3 months prior, with a high anti-body count than someone who got the vaccine first and now have a low-antibody count. Both can get covid, and pass it  on to me (who is also vaccinated). And since it doesnt matter whether you're vaccinated or not, you can still get the virus, why hate so much?

50k per share‚Ä¶ sounds satisfying doesn‚Äôt it? Being able to pay off your home, car, bills. Sounds great right? No. No it doesn‚Äôt.

Idk about you, but 50k is not my target. We haven‚Äôt fought this hard for 50k. I‚Äôve been seeing less and less people mentioning million dollar share prices and I thought I might refresh everyone‚Äôs memories of what we all expect for months now. Or at least what I expect as an individual investor. I don‚Äôt want 50k per share.

As a low xx holder, 50k will help me in life, but it won‚Äôt change my life.

100k will allow me to Buy a home and a car‚Ä¶ but it won‚Äôt change my life.

200k will allow me to buy a home, car, and leave some extra for Some potential investments. But it won‚Äôt change my life.

500k would garner me a house, car, and real estate investments And set me up for a great passive flow of income. But I‚Äôd still work and my life would remain relatively unchanged.

1 million would make my life great. I‚Äôd have what I‚Äôve always wanted. Comfort. But my kids would have to work and fight for their wealth. So 1 million is not enough either.

I‚Äôm just a xx holder. There are plenty more xx holders who require even more than me. This is not financial advice, but I cannot sell for 50k, 100k, 500k or even 1 million. I just can‚Äôt.

The vaccine should never have become politicized. Research conducted shows the efficacy and healthcare workers especially should know better. Ultimately, hospitals can‚Äôt knowingly expose their patients to irresponsible healthcare providers. They would literally be sued to the ground.
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

Peppridge Farms recollects.
I short momentum stocks, and always try to wait for the FOMO wave. You see a trend, you never short that trend. You look at shorts after an acceleration of the trend, and then after this acceleration if you see downtrending volume and rejection of levels below ATH intraday.   

Frankly, we've seen that. We've seen acceleration of the price on lower volume, downtrending volume, and rejection off intraday levels below ATH. It is a decent short right now, so is AFRM, and NET.

It's 61% fully vaccinated, not 90%. And here's what an article from March (when they had a bad Delta spike) says:

The good news is that among Israel's serious infections on Thursday of this week, according to Health Ministry data, the rate of serious cases among unvaccinated people over age 60 (178.7 per 100,000) was nine times more than the rate among fully vaccinated people of the same age category, and the rate of serious cases among unvaccinated people in the under-60 crowd (3.2 per 100,000) was a little more than double the rate among vaccinated people in that age bracket.

Wow you are so cool
If I only had 2 brain cells I‚Äôd believe this shit and yolo with you. I have 3 therefore I don‚Äôt.
I still think UPST is going to rally up to $480-500 before it retraces 40-50% but that's just TA crayons on a chart.

In these types of crazy vertical rallies you get sharper up moves and pullbacks before it fails.

i.e. The action sees bigger swings in both directions in the finale of a blowoff top.

Just basing that off what previous moves look like such as last year's TSLA/EVs/Battery stock rallies.

My advice is not to try to play downside until RSI on UPST completely fails to hold over 75-80.

First couple big dips typically see a lot of buying in the 2nd leg of a rally.

Why is it bullshit? Jobs at hospitals/military/etc have literally always required vaccines.

Fucking George Washington mandated smallpox vaccines for the military.

There is no "right to work any job I want, unvaccinated" in the USA, and there never has been.

The only right that applies is the right of employers to hire/fire whoever the fuck they want, and if they only want to hire vaccinated people to protect their employees, that's their right.
Man people really hated that one

damn. Colin Powell died from Covid
Anti-vaxxers won't hesitate to use that as their "research". Vaccines don't guarantee every single person won't die, especially those with weak immune systems, but they do guarantee that the overall death and even hospitalisation rates go almost to zero. But hey, anti-vaxxers will keep celebrating whenever they find that occasional Covid death (doesn't that mean they finally don't deny Covid exists?) of someone who took the vaccine.
Carry on son. Carry onnnn

Oh shit it was right in front of our eyes, J Powell buying beneath our noses

What ‚Äúprogress with electricity‚Äù? There is a huge energy crisis and most of what we have is fossil fuels

Long $PLUG $BLDP for the hydrogen economy. You saw the deals announced last week including with Airbus and major airports? Also with Phillips 66, a major old school energy player

IONQ gonna fly. This could be a cult stonk like TSLA if WSB wasn't too stupid to understand. Will be shorted because everyone thinks the quantum age is a dream and unattainable within realistic timeframe.
TsLa gonna go red soon??? Or will it print $855 in premkt???

Who could've guessed BIDU was the ultimate hedge today!

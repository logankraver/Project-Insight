‚ÄúSpeaker Nancy Pelosi seemed upbeat as she returned from the White House, telling reporters she believed a deal was within reach, though repeatedly declining to say whether it could happen today.

If you think it was an over reaction then why didn‚Äôt you buy calls that were out of the money around the price before it dropped. Like $75?

Mango is holding strong.  For how high it's ripped, that's pretty bullish for Monday.

It's over

why tf is AAPL not going up

If you don't know what it is then you haven't been paying attention the last 2 days

No shares available to me unfortunately.

I pulled a u/cashflow_ and got 3 spy puts

Cut your losses. This thing isn‚Äôt going to move drastically anymore

Snapchat a snal 75b market cap company tanked nasdaq  and shaved off hundreds of thousands of dollars of company like google fb

Kinda crazy lowkey

Riot will either make or break me next week

Not holding anything short term over the weekend. Mango mania was enough this week. Will evaluate next moves on Monday.

retail don't move shit, if you're worth anything you were part of the original wave

opened the account and did not want to add funds unless sure I was able to buy options

Low amount of shares to trade vs the demand for the shares. Aka low liquidity

10 bucks says this is false propaganda 

"On Friday, the world‚Äôs most indebted property developer made an $83.5 million interest payment to bondholders, according to Securities Times, an official newspaper. The outlet, which is backed by People‚Äôs Daily, the Communist Party‚Äôs official newspaper, didn‚Äôt offer further details.
The payment came with just one day left on a 30-day grace period to avoid a default. The company gripped global financial markets a month ago when it skipped a payment to foreign bondholders, raising the prospect that it could leave global investors with billions of dollars in losses and cause ripples within China‚Äôs property market, a key component of the country‚Äôs economic growth engine."

Wish I waited for a dip to buy my call option lol

No joke. Idk if everyone is putting on their boomer pants or what. As someone still in college, almost every person you meet and socialize with will add you on Snapchat.

ATH 10/29 book it

When a halt upward occurs it‚Äôs to prioritize the sell orders in que first.  A lot of times this causes a panic sell off and kills the momentum.  When halted downwards the buys in que are prioritized first, attempting to slow the sell off.

Do not miss your chance to blow, this opportunity comes only once in a lifetime...

Yes, No, No

lmao yeah it‚Äôs totally someone else‚Äôs fault that you chose to buy in

Yup. Crazy how some people go on and on about how it's not a good business model, no products, site is gonna be easily hacked, etc over the other subs. 

Anyone who is thinking about holding this SPAC long term, I worry about you...The SPAC cycle is not meant for long term hold. LMAO.

Maybe in about 10 years it will get back to $172

I like that guy MARK.  He's pretty cool.  Probably going to hang out this weekend.

Yeah, I‚Äôm aware of that. It‚Äôs not pure arb, but the absurd spread (which is more than the price of DWACW) will probably go down next week

Anyone else picking up SNAP calls? Seems like any bounce next week and these things print.

I‚Äôm in on calls. Average price target is $140 by EOY. Most of these guys here got burned or have puts. It will run

It‚Äôs pretty simple. He‚Äôs not going to jail. The armorer or prop master on set were responsible for making sure the prop gun was safe to use, and they failed their job.

Ive learned pretty quick to stay away from this space when options trading. Just do you own dd and dont play weeklys. Look farther out and buy closer itm calls.

Why would you bring GME and AMC down they have an actual business

Ben(e)d you over the toilet and fuck you raw

Right. Hate it man and usually it picks up immediately AFTER you sell. If you're going with calls I'll start with a few then double down if it dips more, that's what I should've did but went all in at once

Bear traps are set. Have a nice weekend. See you all next week. Hope as exciting as this week.

You do realize FB has already been hit by the same news right? FB owns 91 companies - many over $1b worth - not to mention, Instagram alone might be worth the same as snap. Snap owns a dozen companies, and I guarantee you can‚Äôt name one without googling.

0DTE calls were NOT the move

Nothing like seeing a buncha bag holders being born before your eyes.

It'll dip some more before a recovery just don't sell before it does. I bought NKE after their earnings drop last month and it kept dipping. Had 01/22 160 calls sold for a 40% loss now those calls are ITM and would've been a 180% gain

To qualify there are trading requirements it needs to maintain for a few (\~5) days in a row. CBOE website has a list.

No one talking about SNAP calls. Your supposed to buy when stocks are down. Not when they are up 500% already.

It‚Äôs like pump and dump inception here today.

"Though many investors have worried over how stocks will react when the Fed begins to taper its $120 billion in monthly government bond purchases, the so-far sanguine trading in the options market suggests that market participants are not rushing to buy insurance against volatility over the next few weeks."

It's just probably not going to be until rates actually go up so who knows how big it can get before then.

I'll buy more when options are out

It makes sense - if people shorted it, theyll cover the last thirty minutes or hour, and then it makes the stock look primed for another run so they can short it again Monday.

Watch SPY close at 453.99 to fuck all the 0 day 454c holders

Why are people buying other SPAC stock linked to Patrick Orlando. In case that also has a mango flavour? Or do you know for sure it‚Äôs also Infused with the fruit?
Seems cheap if there‚Äôs an announcement (can‚Äôt find one).
If not.. Might be worth a rogue share. YOLO.

Mind cuck- DWAC, new stonk, early adopters. Can be discussed on WSB but no media coverage for Donald trump. DWAC starts to trend on WSB (You are here). Media decides to start to cover Trump more. Institutional investor and big companies support the SPAC. Sell the news and profit.

I buy when I should be shorting and I short when I should be buying

GSK earnings are next week. Full disclosure I‚Äôve been holding a metric fuck ton of calls for a month. I still think this is the move. There is no IV on the calls, and the monoclonal antibody treatment was sold everywhere last quarter, plus a ton of other shit in the pipeline is doing well. I bet they raise some fucking guidance.

Wtf is going on today.

Yo, so would buying DWAC puts be retarded?

That‚Äôs such a pussy way of saying Fuck Joe Biden. It‚Äôs like Christians saying bless your heart. The intent is the same so just fucking say what you mean. Or shut the fuck up.

Hopes and dreams

Yeah, stop losing money.

This is some mad max shit

I‚Äôd say allow it over market cap. Today was fun. Lots of gains and losses were had.

You were all distracted today by not buying AMZN 0dt puts. Clear pump n dump stock the last two Fridays. Lol

Serious question, why would you ever buy something retarded without setting a stop loss? It‚Äôs fun to get in on a pump and make some free money, but WHY would you not bail out if it goes tits up?

January 2021 vibes all over again and we all know where those SPACs are now. Can‚Äôt save people from themselves, let them have their fun while it lasts. Opening it up just makes this sub a target for P&amp;Ds and spam, but once again, people seem to love that shit

Yeah bro. Blank check shell companies going 17x in in 2 days isn‚Äôt extreme enough for you??

Who are you to say which company is and ain‚Äôt legit? Let the market decide. AMC is just as much of a pump and dumb as Mango IMO. 

Personally with more than 70 million people who voted for him, I think ü•≠ will actually be successful. I think in 5 years it will be a $1 trillion company. Has huge potential to grow and compete with not only social media, but Netflix, AWS, and Apple.

It's not fair and I'm gonna cry some more about it

I understand, my other issue is I think it‚Äôs user base has a growth problem. Anything linked to Trump will lose out on a lot of growth. Take a look at his hotel business losing lots of revenue.

Might as well allow them if they are above a certain market cap. It is WSB, for making stupid plays.

Man, are they gonna make sure s&amp;p is green today?

Not when there is no basis for the the hype. Mango had a basis, news, and it‚Äôs cap came above limit. 

These new ones are straight pump and dump SEC oversight of the sub territory. Nothing but the CEO‚Äôs name attached driving them and word of mouth here.

people underestimate trump, that doesn't mean these are pump and dumps, has no bearing on the success of the app long term .

Well intel looks like free money as in Jan they are releasing their gpu lineup. So they would have to fuck up royally to blow this away. But I guess given how good AMD is with their cpu lineup it might be correct. Still I‚Äôm bullish on intel until jan dGPU release.

YES SIR

MAQC grabbing a good amount right now.

So there's a problem with the way we detect and block SPACS: it isn't automated. We just manually flag them as spacs in our DB if we know about them ahead of time or remember to. I'm retarded so you can guess how well that works.

What do you think, should we just allow them if they're above the right market cap (1.5b)? That might mean that you have to deal with the bot being an asshole about the market cap if it's not updating as per TDAmeritrade or Polygon.io though.

Shoutout to my boy BENE

Yesterday premarket

I would say NVDA is safer as they have an absolutely massive moat, especially when it comes to AI. Less competition too (as you know, there are a trillion EV companies.)

I'd say that it has the best chance out of any company right now, based on growth and demand.

More investments to consider: AMZN, GOOGL, COIN, BABA, DIS.

I'm not trying to steer you one way or another, but I worked my way up to a significant amount of money before and blew it up, thinking it was impossible. 

I learned a lot and I'm currently working my way back up, but it's tough and nothing is a guarantee, especially in this market. Please don't be like me.

Regardless, best of luck.

How many meme contenders do you have to own at once to actually have a chance of being in when these things moon? Or is it simply a case of jumping on a moving train early enough? I got lucky with GME and made a small bit recently with BB, but these f\* Trump pumps were well out the gate before I got in. When did all the chat hit about DWAC? Before or AH last night?

Well it's the SECs job to investigate and define that. A stock going +1000% in 2 days isn't going to be caused by just a bunch of redditors. But currently the definition is "whatever they feel like investigating" which seems to be actually nothing, and the retail holders and redditors are the ones that get fucked in the end.

If by ‚Äúthose people‚Äù, you mean not a desperate poor, yes‚Ä¶ that is correct

if you're 24 and think this ride is going to last forever, you have a lot of growing up to do. You should be developing a hard/technical skill so when the show stops you can have a job. Otherwise your earnings are going to attrite back into the economy as a means of supporting yourself - and that's if you have the foresight to save it in the meantime. If you're frivolously spending it with the expectation that "I could do this forever" then you'll be sorely disappointed whenever that day comes. Either way I wish you the best of luck but don't think it's going to be this easy forever.

Bene might be a momentum trade 200m market cap SPAC

I think SNAP was and still is really overvalued but I might buy soon.  Eventually people will forget the real numbers and start swooning over the CEO talking about augmented reality again

yeah this could easily be an aggressive sideways trend before we pick back up.

How do you get in BEFORE in things like DWAC? Why some people do and some dont? This fucking kills me. I could have made 1M in a day if anyone two days ago told me about Trump and his social media.

Just realize that for every person who does that and posts it there are probably &gt;10x as many people who overall lose money on their option trades.  


Also realize that when someone shows the $150 -&gt; $2k play they likely lost money on their other trades leading up to that point

If u ain't selling DWAC before close I don't think anything can save you

His first year (2001) he was up 55%. When he was up a ‚Äúmeasly‚Äù 18% the entire market tanked 22%. You‚Äôre right, that‚Äôs average. I‚Äôm sure every hedge fund was hitting those same numbers. Also you mentioned he sold his gme, he didn‚Äôt sell it all before the takeoff, he just sold enough to not have to report his position to the sec. he owned like 10% of the company at the beginning. You can go ahead and stay salty and ignore facts, I‚Äôm sure that at the end of the day when he‚Äôs rubbing 100 dollar bills on his balls he will care about your wrong opinion.

If you look at the HQ buildings in Santa Clara/Silicon Valley, it starts to make sense why INTC is such a dumpster fire. Why would anyone want to work in such a dull, outdated and vastly inferior workplace? Compare their headquarters to NVDA HQ for example. That place is likely to attract top talent. AAPL HQ, same thing. If I‚Äôm basing investments on that criteria, FB r fuk too.

from what i'm looking at scion's returns are nothing special compared to other hedge funds. had a good year due to the big short, but aside from that he had two years with 40%+ returns (one 45% and one 40%) and the next highest was a 13% return and the lowest was an 18% loss (these are numbers from its original operation, not the past 8 years since he reopened). obviously he's a good enough trader to be successful and professional, but he's not some market genius lol his notoriety so far outweighs his actual understanding of the economy

But look at the fibonacci.....

Banbet also gives $100 apparently

I've been working on a model that assigns ban costs given a certain percent target and time maturity. I.e AAPL up 1.5% in 1 week deserves a 2month ban given that it is very likely. or MSFT being down 20% in one month deserves 2 or so weeks since it is unlikely. I am still working out the thresholds because we don't the ban cost to be super low for unlikely events because that would just flood the bets with unlikely events given the cost is so low. I am also trying to figure out the optimal minimum and maximum ban lengths so I could tweak them based on your requirements. Would this be something you would consider?

&gt;	The transaction values Trump Media &amp; Technology Group at an initial enterprise value of $875 Million, with a potential additional earnout of $825 Million in additional shares (at the valuation they are granted) for a cumulative valuation of up to $1.7 Billion depending on the performance of the stock price post-business combination. 

Depending on the meaning of the valuation they are granted, this could very well mean that DWAC represents only 15% of the actual Trump social network‚Äôs valuation, which would make Trump‚Äôs share worth ***$20 billion***. We truly live in incredibly dumb times

Yea you‚Äôre right. He‚Äôs made more than 2 trades. Scion capital beat spy every fucking year while it was active by a large margin(+30-40%).

GOOG and FB have been VERY prepared for these ad relates headwinds imposed by Apple's new privacy policy. Snap HAS not and were caught off guard. In fact in the previous ER they minimized Apple's privacy policy on advertisers and even said it had little bearing. 

Yesterday's ER painted a diff sorry and the impact was much greater than anticipated. Again, bc Snap was ILL PREPARED. They're didn't develop tools for better advertising engagement. FB and GOOG have been ahead of the curve and will be LESS impacted

Theres a lot of big businesses that support Trump, at least more than the media likes people to believe. If he‚Äôs dropping a platform like this in such a serious manner, as he just did, then I think him and his team already have it figured out, honestly.

(Reuters) - Venture Capitalist **Jerome Powell** announces acquisition of S&amp;P 500 **($SPY)**, taking company private at $600 per share.  
  
The offer represents a 33% premium to S&amp;P 500's **($SPY)** Monday closing price of $450.  
  
Earlier this year, Reuters reported that the company was in talks with private equity firms for a potential sale.  
  
Commenting on the acquisition, Powell remarked "brrrrrrr"

In all seriousness, I searched YT for ‚Äúlive stock show‚Äù at 8:00a because Bloomberg wanted to talk about 0.1% gains and ignore mango + p hun type things

Auntie Cathy selling DKNG?

They are convertible to shares at 1:1 ratio but can only be converted 30 days after merger. If you believe that the shares will be worth more than the warrant price now 30 days after the merger then you profit.

So how low does the COIN dip go before it continues upwards? I'm holding so my guess is -50% or more, cos that's what always happens to the stocks I hold.

Well will you go ahead and buy it then?

Yeah because that‚Äôs obviously a market that‚Äôs not already saturated with options and closed off with licensing agreements

Not too get too political, but that white nationalist and hate content isn‚Äôt as common as most people think. I‚Äôm not talking about people who say ‚Äúwe support the police‚Äù I‚Äôm talking about actual white nationalism. The idea that  it‚Äôs so prevalent is incredibly misled and propagated by the side who doesn‚Äôt like Trump. 

Trump‚Äôs base wants a platform that lacks censorship so it is allowed to post something like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like when BLM riots burn down businesses‚Äù without being removed from Twitter. 

The advertisements will primarily come from military related support groups, businesses aimed at helping veterans, local businesses, ect

Depends on the interest rates. Debt obtained prior to inflation costs less (if wages adjust).

Just because the last few failed doesn‚Äôt follow that this one will.

You can't print all the money that the federal reserve just did and expect inflation to be transitory. You're living in a fantasy world if you think that's true. 2nd) the US can't afford to raise rates so inflation is only going to get worse. Sounds like you're the one who doesn't know what they're talking about.

If 10% of American social media users moved to mango you would have ungodly amounts of money.

Fair, but this is also a social media platform backed by Trump itself. So, it‚Äôs kinda different in that sense, you know? It‚Äôs going to bring in supporters/support for it

Homes up nearly 40%, gas up significantly, food up a lot as well. The sign is there that inflation is here to stay. You can think it's transitory all you want but you're wrong

Unpopular opinion (probably) : 

I don‚Äôt know if most of you can‚Äôt put two and two together, but once DWAC allows for options trading, and then when the platform actually releases, it‚Äôs going to go up more than it has these last two days. 

Not saying it‚Äôs necessarily a long term hold at this price, but for a short time when options are available/when the platform actually drops, it‚Äôs going to go up more. 

Plus a lot of Trumps base will use the platform so DWAC is going to maintain a solid price for that reason itself

We ending today green so it don't even matter

I'm just gonna match whatever the Fed does from now until I die. If they're easing I'm buying, if they're tightening I'm selling. Because our nation literally couldn't survive going back to 5% interest rates at this point.

Mango/PHUN holds over the weekend going to be easy 3x/8x me thinks.

And no available trucks to ship them fast enough. Production isn't the problem. Logistics is. It's not limited to domestic shipping, either. JIT logistics is fucking up pricing everywhere.

I predict every company to have record profits and warn on guidance due to supply chain issues. So every stock will tumble at first and then everyone will realize everyone is affected by supply chain issues and then they'll look at these stocks as all in the same ocean again and the winners will go back up relative to everyone else.

Example:
Google made 8 gazillion dollars. Yay. Stock goes up. But fear supply chain issues. Booo. Stock goes down.

After everyone says the same thing, they'll realize that I gazillion dollars with supply chain issues is better than 8 dollars  and also with supply chain issues, and Google will go back up again.

So you can buy now, or buy after the guidance dip, but it's going to be a discount on what is a clear winner for many of these companies.

Record profits but on sale because they're affected by the same pandemic affecting the entire fucking planet? Oh no, what a terrible stock, they're making record profits in a pandemic. Idiots. 

Keep buying is my advice.

See ya everyone! Hope y‚Äôall made money too! Time for some fun.

I just think the barrier to entry on Amazon options is so high that they take advantage of it to exploit max pain much more regularly on it than other mega cap stocks. 

Honestly I don't know for sure, of course. It is the only think that really makes sense for this stock to have traded sideways for the past few months. 

I get the run up has been insane on it, but at this point it was higher in August of 2020 and can't even hold that high for very long.  With AWS, expanding brick and mortar footpring,  and them transitioning into one of the top 2 or 3 shippers in the country/world, I just don't understand what explains the sideways action.

IS there still time to buy spy puts? Whats your prediction for EOD? I hate this this board is only about mango now

yeah. it's related to the greeks, but the general idea is that options will carry some "momentum" at smaller time scales. If SPY is falling a dollar a minute then the calls will depreciate more, once the decline stops, even  if it doesn't rise all the way, the calls will gain more money back because now the chance of reversal exists and the downward momentum is diminishing.

&gt; I'm feeling good. I think SNAP is going to have a great quarter and the stock price will be up by next Friday morning.

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/The_Annunzio (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 447.4206 when it was 451.94 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Last 5 minutes! Mango pump until 12:15!

Oh I‚Äôm sorry, I thought ü•≠ was about to happen again

Take my upvote you funny bastard

Can‚Äôt wait to see all the DWAC loss porn this weekend

It‚Äôs a platform popular among young people. Perfect for targeted marketing. 

It‚Äôs just that, one, only 16% of people allowed SNAP to track data after Apple‚Äôs update. 

And two, stealing children‚Äôs data so you can put products in front of their face is absolutely just ASKING for the hammer to come down eventually.

I put in some play money that has turned into real money but amma let er ride. Fuckem

BUY THE DIP

SHOP giving me those eyes rn. 10/29‚Äôs?

To new investors, now is not the time to be asking to get into dwac. Yesterday morning when it was $10-12 was. There is no product, this was and is purely a pump and dump. Most of us are out. I bought at 12 and sold before close yesterday. Bought again this morning at 88 and sold at 120. You see how the game is played? If there were options I would be buying a put.

Basically. Deadline is the 31st but they always pass it before the deadline

it is the third time that I buy high and sell low mango

this is the bottom, buy calls now or be broke forever

The show goes on ‚ÄºÔ∏è

It's a SPAC. Don't options only become available once it merges with its company?

Baldwin is lucky he only killed a women and didn‚Äôt tell a homophobic joke

What's up with all this David Tepper double talk? Sounds bearish.

Lmao I need it back at 120 to sell and break even. Should I sell now at 100 or will it touch 120 once more

But will she fuck you?  I think she prefers to screw her constituents

As long as the price is this high hedge funds or whoever it is that is selling these calls and then working the price to sweep the chips off the table every week is scum.

I've learned my lesson. Hard.  There is just no reason for this stock to be trading sideways at this point other than retail can't do shit about it.

What makes you think this?

technically this is a "recession" the "inflation" is just a side effect

now if you a poker player you can calculate how much inflation you got in your hand and bid to to frighten the recession bidders from raising

but it starts with  the money bet on a recession hand, the guy picked up his cards and that's what he seeed. Now he lookin you in the eye and he calculating his next bid.

Powell: Inflation is transitory and will work itself out. We will consider not pumping hundreds of billions into the economy every month at a much later date when the economy is doing great.

New Rule: Fed can't trade individual stocks

Powell: Inflation is a systemic risk. We now need to seriously consider tapering now. Its the responsible thing to do.

Sq is always a good buy when its down, no cap

I‚Äôve been buying spy calls mid day when it‚Äôs red like right now. Spy and qqq are tech heavy though. I‚Äôd wait for the 10 year to cool off or buy the dip with stocks

Stock is pretty volatile and could run up in the next year or could even continue to fall. 

It's a real company and will likely get there eventually either way

Why the fucking mass sell of today?

Entire portfolio is red. Cool.

You are kidding right?

This might be a rebound üòê maybe I take out profits now

I buy on momentum, momentum stops and reverses.

I buy the dip, the dip continues.

Thankfully, when I get it right, I get it bigly. Keep your heads up and you‚Äôll get get wins once in a while.

You clowns stop selling gme for dwac

Ya true, def overly emotional there.  Trying to learn how to keep a better handle on things.

My 401k is up 4 dollars today.

I remember they were the talk of the town here for being such a stupid idea for a company and being way overvalued. I still can't believe the sociopath who was in charge was renting out buildings he personally owned to his own company.

Agree. Tbh, new ü•≠ media venture (social media, TV, events, etc.) is only valued at a few billion. For perspective NFLX is valued at around $300B. The YouTube and YouTubeTVsegment of GOOG is likely worth over $500B by itself. Current value is roughly 50x lower than NFLX. Is it speculative? Fuck yea. Does it have legitimate upside potential from current price? Yea. It also has a spokesperson who, for better or worse, absolutely know how to attract attention. And it has the most meme potential of anything I've seen in a long time. All aboard the mango train! ü§† ü•≠ üöÜ

I absolutely cannot wait to get off to some incredible loss porn next week

We moved from dwac. PYPL üöÄ

Do you feel SPY and TQQQ are safe?

tbh this is probably the worst place anywhere to be asking for stock tips...

Play with üî• and that will happen

Ugh donnie crashing the stock market from the grave

and mods not banning the mango pumpers.

Just waiting for investors to realize that this era of data-mining will be seen in the future as a ‚Äúwild west‚Äù era where you could just steal people‚Äôs data with no repercussions. 

Just Apple changing its policy made SNAP go down 22% ‚Äî so, so many of these names are heavily reliant on stealing your data for targeted marketing. 

I think Apple changed its policy because the writing is on the wall: collecting data without asking was a pretty obvious privacy violation with heavy regulatory risk.

It‚Äôll be interesting, just my two cents.

The bull trap haa been sprung! Goodbye my sweet sweet calls

Blood in stool needs to be checked out, could be serious bruh

Lmaoooo someone has to hold the bags my dude, otherwise this shit wouldn‚Äôt be profitable for half. Thanks for your sacrifice

Trump is an absolute boss. You don't have to like him bc most people hate their bosses. Nevertheless this company is going to fuck up digital media so good!

Yikes. Round numbers are dangerous. I took my Roth IRA from $28k to $48k in two months and then got greedy trying to hit 50 and rode it back down to $32k in a day with the big tech dump.

Brexit memes are back again I guess

Trump and mango\* team thinks this company is worth $880 million. Random redditors on internet thinks this company is worth 88 billion dollars ($1000 price target) lmaooooooooo with 0 product. 88 billion dollars is worth 40 times more than trumps real networth and can make a random spac go up 20 times its NAV loooooooooooool.

Like I said, it's an SPAC so any DD would have likely been auto removed. I doubt many people here knew ahead of time anyway, most of the early guys probably just have alerts set for big movers.

not a bad place to be. alts are going to go off in December

Hopefully, it isn't in Aokigahara forest

Here's the plan. Noon on the east coast. From now till 12:15 run Mango to the moon and sell everything at 12:16. 
Here. We. Go.

Up 50% on 10/29 $OPEN puts, still holding for now

When? I want a link lol and that would have made me right for the timeframe...

Could go either way.. but I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs been holding 85 for awhile

Dare I say it, is WISH a buy here?

I dont understand. The markets are regulated. This is what regulation looks like. ü§°

Sometimes i just wish that i have that kind of elon musk money to throw in thousands of thousands to 0dte SPY puts and calls and just watch it goes up and down without worrying about anything

Gonna go for a depression walk

I'm gonna have a long and dull week next week. Was nice chatting with you people. See you in a week.

Lower first, then higher again. It's not a fast moving stock. The pop today was bound to have profit taking from peeps playing earnings. Look at the chart, though. Looking good.

Please sell me more WISH at 1x Price/Sales, thank you for this charity

Buy the SPY dip?

An idiot for sure. Probably losing money on $IBM

What‚Äôs the move for AAPL before earnings

Trump have picked up right industry now‚Ä¶look at FB with 900B+ market cap. Twitter 50B+ market cap.

Should combine forces with another 100% loss trader and then you can inverse each other and keep the market in a perpetual sideways motion forever.

Yeah I can't wait for the real ticker to go live and he gets reverse splits until they are worth more than BERK-A. Anyone with half a brain knows he'll do that.

He probably knows the real money is make it go meme-stock and dilute at the top but his ego will want the actual highest stock price.

Seems pretty obvious that ü•≠ made his new social media platform for one reason:

STONK SKYROCKET.

I paper handed spy puts a bunch of times this morning and lost a lot of money. Each time I bought 200 spy puts exp monday. Then I rebought at a higher price and only bought 100 puts. Had I held through the dips, I would have made about 30k. FML

Lol, i must‚Äôve mist it then, only heard about it this morning on WSB. But then again i live in Europe so maybe that‚Äôs why it wasn‚Äôt on the news

Lmao if anybody bought BABA 0 DTEs puts at the top today must be so happy right now

I‚Äôd rather see it swing from 100 to 400 to 30 to back to 80 than to have these circuit breakers interrupting it 20 times during the day

Nah, for weeks and weeks a lot of them have been calling for tapering starting November. But yeah they absolutely sold the tippy top and then decided to all of a sudden become ethical people just before they dunk on us.

I'm glad you've got it all figured out.

Im pumping and dumping Mango. But look there is still hope. Buy it and dont sell. Dont let the libs win.

Yeah but they have been saying this shit. It's all a game.

Congrats on the profit today tho!

Only 28 mil shares of Mango available and 600 mil volumes 2 days. 

Hodl bois! We own the boat!

New investors came out of the woodwork to buy gme. I'm 100% speculating they will figure it out.  I know it could go back to $10, but I think trumpers will buy and hold. The irrationality of Trump supporters is my entire hypothesis on this one.

Take this as a learning opportunity and don't ever FOMO into something that's already rocketed.

Not sarcasm. What are we even doing here? If the market is supposed to function under a certain set of rules and Underlying characteristics actually affect the stock price other than Jerome Powell and the word interest rates. Then GME is as solid as gold.

Otherwise the market is just a casino where interest rates determine gains. Which is what most of you retards are betting on

another fund, Lighthouse Investments, divested from DWAC today after finding out about Trump's involvement.  Obviously they booked a nice gain, but this is the third investment group to pull out.  Mango is toxic to investors.   Yes, Trump's followers are brainless and will pour into this thing, but unless you hate money you have to read the writing on the wall.

The lying fake news trading commission halted one of, if not the, best stock on the market, many people are saying this, great people, yuge people, they‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs rigged, they‚Äôre saying the Chinese have rigged this system to ruin this great nation, just as they have rigged their global warmth hoax as an economic attack on our beautiful, strong way of life, working hand in hand with the devious Russians. The leader of the Russians is named Putin, so I‚Äôm told. He‚Äôs got ‚Äúput‚Äù in his name, folks, you can‚Äôt make this up.

The deleveraging because of intense volatility. It happens when some stocks go off the charts, it creates risk for the broader market and leverage gets pulled by hedgies and market makers. Happent with gme, amc, and when tesla was making the big move last year in August.

GME Apes : this is why your dream of reaching $50K/share will never happen lol

Time to close my trading app and go do something else today I think

Back up the rollercoaster

Holy shit rug pull on spy what happened?!

stay out, volume crush

Let‚Äôs never discuss how many VXX calls I sold yesterday

Funny how stable fb has been today. Ironic. üòÇ

Switch to 453 spy puts and I'm fucking printing!

It's not a loss until they sell, and judging by the rest of the memes this morning these are the people who couldn't sell GME at 300.

Thats what im doing. Out at 140 back in at 69

12/17s, not too much theta yet.  Should have easily been offset by .5% drop.

Jay: Bitch did you really just ask that question?

right at the end of a long market pump, you have absurdly gains of high risk stocks because people are getting less and less risk averse and chasing riskier plays‚Ä¶ the gains are the most extreme right before the collapse, its like this everytime.

Fucking SPY WAR going on. Bears are winning.

Start by reading the news...

anyone buying the FB dip before they smash earnings?

Yeah thought you could make money from a scammer who lost money on casinos? Lol

All businesses are failed but yeah... Dwac.

Happened to me to, made me lose over $500 bucks in a second

I expect a run like SPCE where it bounces all over the place and no one knows what the fuck will happen next

So every adult american paying 50 dollars to listen to Mango and people plotting terrorist attacks? Sounds reasonable.

This pile of dog shit is Nikola 2.0, billions of dollars in market cap without a product

I made a 350% killing on DWAC, and I am so tempted to jump in and out again.  someone with money tell me what to do

/u/allinonworkcalls (1/0) made a bet that WISH would go to 5.4 when it was 6.0 and it did, congrats fucker.

AMD pump was a trap. Thousands of fund managers sitting on sell limit orders @120 ready to kill any catalyst, or something.

That‚Äôs fair, but it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm losing all my money even if it doesn‚Äôt go up. I threw my portfolio into it but I still have money in the bank so I‚Äôm good either way  üòá

I‚Äôm dumb but I‚Äôm not stupid

This is my lesson in placing limit buys. My order filled at $175, what do I win?

Seeing red again seeing red again seeing red again

I don't understand this stuff. Like some of y'all bought the DWAC stuff yesterday. How do you know this stuff? Maybe I should stop reading the Hunt Showdown and Valheim subreddits only.

#tump just commented on the DWAC situation:


Halts are the greatest threat in the US to both bald and golden eagles. Media claims fictional ‚Äòglobal warming‚Äô is worse. They would never halt Hillary. SAD!

Thats why I bought them yesterday.  Turns out I didn't need leverage on that one.

But they don't have any earnings

Nah Biden will pull some shit out of his ass

tapering is still on

ü•≠ had me up over 200% at one point but ended my run with it making a measly 10%. Lesson learned I guess. But hey. 1k is 1k. That‚Äôs what I get for thinking this shit was going to make me a millionaire.

Go to Bestbuy and get a OMEN laptop. It‚Äôs got specs for a gaming laptop and it runs everything super smooth. I enjoy it, only cost like 980, maybe like 1.2k if you get a bigger screen and other shit.

Just saying, there are dips on the way up. I'd be more worried about averaging down than panic selling right now. This has at least a week's worth of climbing left.

Hey @jpow fuck you

I don't care about what you "feel" we need to prioritize. The point was that you have a false idea of what Mango man did and I corrected it. Okay? It's cleared up. Accept that you were wrong about him and move on. It's real simple. My job is done. Have a nice day. Hope you recover your losses. Snapchat was a big hit.

The best part is that all the political morons here are the ones that will be bag holding this shit.

Powell says he‚Äôs done with the printer

They need a commoner on the Fed board to call the others out on their shit and tell off the politicians for their policies.  JPow can't tell the truth because he's too worried about his next term or tanking his 5 million dollar portfolio.

I warned about Mango, expect him next to "raise capital" by dumping shares on you, he has a habit of fucking his supporters when he doesn't need them anymore, I mean, like just after the Jan 6 insurrection.

JFC, you should try to buy stocks that go up

No it‚Äôs because they made the single comment of ‚Äúapple new IOS doesn‚Äôt allow ad companies to track their ad campaigns‚Äù. So Ad companies can‚Äôt target adds to you and know how well they are working. So it scared other companies that base their revenue off of add sales.

So it‚Äôs expected that other companies that are based on this will have bad earnings as well. Fuck snap chat. No one uses it. It‚Äôs gay. Facebook is actually used, if not should be a classified addiction.

And made a lot of us a lot of money.

Not me, sold at 23.95.

Thank god I resisted the fomo. Still shaking though. Support looks to be close to 12 bucks

Well, would you consider last year a full meltdown? A lot of people lost money, but some bought at the bottom and made real gains within a few months. 

Anyway, I do hope I'm wrong and I was painting the worst case scenario, but unlike most here, I'm actually in the ER seeing patients, so I am concerned.

Bruh PayPal didn't deserve to lose 30b in market value just because they wanted to buy out another company like what the genuine fuck

Easily. Twitter  + hype + boomer cash + fundamentals don't matter

Did you stick your face in a pile of shit for that info?

It was a play, it paid, cash in and move on

Yeah, I feel it.  I heard about this yesterday and took too long to commit otherwise I could've been up 10x+. I'm definitely rethinking how I can use my meme stock/pure gamble portion of my portfolio better.

70% is a great week!

Yesterday's snap earnings exposed big tech and the QQQ as being a shitty business model

If it's any consolation, I thought I knew how to take DWAC profits at 20 yesterday and then again at 50.

Google is feeling the effects of this too; however, they‚Äôll fare better than snap and maybe even Facebook since they collect so much first party data. Not to mention a lot of google ads are intent based rather than ‚Äòavatar‚Äô based. Aka they serve ads based on what you search rather than guessing what you‚Äôre interested in based on your online footprint.

Really ugly chart haha, you are right.


They have just started generating revenue, with insane growth projected for FY 2022 which began in july. They just had a great earnings call. I would strongly suggest checking out that most recent call.


Fair value is between 14 and 22 and its currently sitting around 6. Positive news weekly. Just today they announced a new partnership that will bring in 6 figured in revenue which adds to the 105m in guidance. Profitability is around the corner. Their 2020 and 2021 acquisitions set them as the premier player in esports gambling and they will be the first in the country very soon - in NJ.


They do a LOT and they do it all very well through their acquisitions and synergies.

Earnings reports are due from a lot of bigger ad-dependent companies pretty soon. If SNAP brought goog FB twtr down with its bad news, the same will happen the other way when they show slower growth or missed marks.

Pro tip: If you want to short DWAC and unable to locate shares you can short the warrants DWACW. Also doesn't get halted when DWAC gets halted so can get an entry.

If you block selling..

If you block selling how then are people buying?

Lmao. You are a legend.

No shit lol

Everyone saying DWAC is finished when is up 103% on the day.

Because the broker serves as a matchmaker between you and someone with a buy order. If I had a moonshot buy order for a $100 stock set at $50, whether by accident or leftover or being hopeful, and your SL executes a market sell at $100, broker matchmaking might work out in my favor and I get your shares mad cheap because your supply meets my demand. That's why it might be better to use stop limit orders in the future, although those have downsides as well.

You know what? I'm glad to have bought $17.67 and sold $50.81. I still don't know what you people were doing all day yesterday.

Honestly if DWAC would stop getting halted every fucking 10 minutes it would actually go up again. But jeez surprised it hit 157 in 1 day

Now they just randomly halting it

there cant be THAT many halts on DWAC right?  Like every fucking 10 minutes there's another one. How is it calculated?

they keep adding supply but it doesn't mean anything, it's trapped on the feds balance sheet, velocity has been and still is tumbling, price increases are primarily due to scarcity + supply chain, which will not be resolved until we get a deflationary unwind

Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). Up 156% over the past 5 years, 81% for the past one year. Almost 5% in the past week. Not sure what is going on. I am long in it and am appreciative of the gains. Just wanted to share.

Neither was goog

Just think about the amount of $$ i lost to 0dte spy hurts me lol that $$ could go into play like affirm or net last 2 weeks anyway market always open for the opportunities so yeah good luk to both of us

I don‚Äôt think people get that, even if inflation is ‚Äútransitory,‚Äù higher prices are not. Sure the inflation rate will eventually get back down to 2%, but the price increases and devaluation of the dollar has already happened. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre going to do a USD FORK and burn supply, this isn‚Äôt exactly a well run project. We just keep adding supply, infinitely.

Nope. I refuse

Ok fellows apes. I haven't been much active in here ever since GME, but today I decided to comment because I believe there's something truly important about to go on. Please let me know if you think I should make this a post. 

I'm a health care worker in Portugal, the world's most vaccinated country, with more than 90% fully vaccinated. Despite this incredible vaccination rate, with many older people already getting their booster shots, we're actually seeing an increasing in the number of daily COVID cases for the last days. This is due to a number of factors, specially a new Delta variant mutation and the end of summer. 

This trend is also going on in many countries around the world right now. The UK is having a major comeback of daily cases and Puttin had to give one week off to Russian workers to try and stop a similar new wave. I wholeheartedly hope I'm wrong here, but if things keep going in this direction,  within the next 30 days Europe will be going into a winter with chaos at hospitals, out of control inflation and now natural gas to heat homes. 

Giving the many other uncertainties going on around markets right now, I believe a new wave of infections would have devastating effects on the markets. While this can lead to losses, it also means there would be opportunities for buying massive dips. 

This is not financial advice. I'm in no way as experienced as many in here, but this community has been great to me and I feel like many here aren't aware of this rapidly growing risk.

I remember when everyone laughed at people who bought GME at 150.  I was one of those people.  I sold it at 130 for a loss feeling like I made it out ok.  Weeks later, it was back over 200.  Not making that mistake again with orange man

In at $175 pray for me

This was announced yesterday. Most of the MAGA world doesn't know about it yet. I think by the end of this weekend they'll all know about the Trump stock. Big after hours, big Monday. I'm not looking to hold too long though...

Oof. 

You can cancel your order to buy during a halt.

You can create new order to sell for a lower price during a halt (or change your current order). You can also add stop losses. 

There is a reason why companies open at much lower price with significant margin after halting period.

Oh, my god.

I knew it. Dude, go research why Trump did the bans. He did the bans because we were literally under terrorist attacks from Muslim countries and Islamist groups like ISIS, and he shut down travel between our countries to reduce exposure to the groups. How is that unreasonable and personally affecting you to a point of taking it so personally to a point of insult to your family -- who I am sure were not the terrorists we were defending ourselves against?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive\_Order\_13769#:\~:text=Trump's%20stated%20reason%20for%20issuing,pose%20no%20increased%20terror%20risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13769#:~:text=Trump's%20stated%20reason%20for%20issuing,pose%20no%20increased%20terror%20risk).

Jesus christ. Like I said, you're looking for stuff to be mad about. You don't want to know the truth. You just want to have someone to hate ironically for no reason.

He was protecting the country. Any rational person would shut the doors to their house to certain people from another house if they saw people from that house going into it, killing people, and breaking everything. He didn't say all Muslims were bad. But, if terrorists are coming from Muslim countries? Yeah, stop them from coming for a while until you figure it out. My god.

$DWAC is like every Trump business‚Ä¶huge hype and fanfare at the beginning followed by a bankruptcy, crash, closure and lawsuits.  Congrats to those who got in early and got out with their money.  Sympathies to those who bought over $100 will be losing their shirts.

Blew my load at 180 but managed to avg down to 150 am fukt

Actually $24

Well damn, $93 pre market to 131 to 157 to sold at 110.  

I want to play again and try to recapture that potential gain that I saw momentarily... must not stick PP into meat grinder.....

I just want 1% SPY

Worried about the halt? Portillos ain't halting lets gooooo

!banbet SPY -10% 5w

Lmao. Is the rug pull happening so soon?

Dwac looking like the casinos that orange man runs

I heard one of the mango forums had boomers asking if settlement period was big government trying to limit them from buying mango stock. Lmfao, these are the people you're betting your money on.

This is better than any TV show. I love watching meme stocks pop. There are gonna be some folks with new cars and others who overnight became "investors" in a shitty spac.

You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders, the most famous of which is ‚ÄúNever get involved in a land war in Asia,‚Äù but only slightly less well known is this: ‚ÄúNever trust a mango when money is on the line!‚Äù

Can we get back to BAU soon. I‚Äôm drowning in the self pitty of having no one fill my order and consequently being forced to pay for my new house with real money.

Told you guys yesterday to get COST 10/22 480s when they were .8 was an easy 4x.  10/29 500 are only .55 right now they will easily be a 5x next week

it did, but they shut it down because everyone took names like DonaldTrump and MikePence and started posting pig poop balls and well‚Ä¶ the rest is history

Robert Durst was sent to life in prison - looks like he'll be there until EOY then

Supposedly if a stock moves more then 30 % the stock exchange halts the trading. However the length of the halt makes a huge difference and I'm not sure there are any regulations on that?

Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

I am not a day trader, however, i also am not a robinhood guy. I have a real brokerage account with real accounts and retirement accounts and my own "TOD" account where i fuck around myself with. Anyone who didn't have a stop loss set is a moron. I can't believe i didn't set one up when i woke up, i was still groggy. I got out at 105. Probably $25 a share too late., but i still made $2500 buying 40 shares.   my whole point? Set stop losses at where you're comfortable to get out at and be happy with it. I will buy more when it settles a bit later i think. I still like the stock.

Maybe.  But all it takes is one trip like we saw in the last hour to make most people take the money and run, not pump.  I don't know why people are comparing it to GME.  This is a non-existent company with no profit, no short, no nothing.  It's betting that every Conservative in the country wants to give money to Trump since they can't vote for him.  Even though a good portion of them don't know wtf a "stock" is.

This system is so fuk up.  I understand circuit breakers (good and bad) but having stops qued up and the volatility jumping so far and orders not getting filled is BS.  I had 3 stop losses at same amount on different accounts, 2 got filled and 1 didn't.  It won't allow you to even set them now unless it's at bid level.  This sucks for people that buy in and don't set them early.

I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This fall I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into Southern American mango futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another fruit. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's mango yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Alabama and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the mango bubble burst on Oct 22. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for Halloween, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of Oct 22nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive mango shipment from Kentucky, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the mangos in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined.

That's like saying MSFT or AAPL or TSLA is old news

Trump and dump

Remember when we all made fun of the guy who bought GME at 150?

I saw it pop 170 for a sec, my guess is it wasn't retail who sold that.

Let their tears be the rain that washes over us

FB at a major discount!! FB is trading down on nothing but the negative press, fundamentally it's an incredible company. With the current short attention span news cycle we have, that FB itself helps create. The recovery will be swift and profitable.

I mean a $10B valuation for mango in this market is not unreasonable at all. Just gonna take a while as hype settles in. Regardless, this really goes to show why circuit breakers are so useful. This thing would've ticked at 500 if not for halts.

yeah a spac is a special purpose acquisition company that only exists as a publicly traded shell company for the sole purpose of merging with a private company (with a 24 month deadline to merge), and in that way the combined company becomes publicly traded.

In this case, DWAC the SPAC has announced a deal to merge with trump's company that at the moment has no product launched itself, and only vague rhetoric that that product will be some sort of social media app

I have not gotten any fucking work done in the last week. I‚Äôm fucking done.

It seems to hurt more to sell for a profit and continue watching a stock rise than it does taking an actual loss.

I agree there should not be a limit up rule but it is what it is

Where are we allowed to talk about small cap stocks at a SP of over $5?


I cant seem to find a sub that will allow me to share DD on a damn near sure thing 4x return in 6-8 months.

\- too many threads and spam here, similar to this videogame one

\- new "THE\_DWAC" subreddits are opened and circlejerk their bags

\- new dates will be posted to push out the eventual galaxy-landing and keep 'em hooked ("November 15th is when xyz happens", ... cue November 12th "listen, December 20th is when it actually happens". Rinse and repeat)

It traded 20 million shares in the first minute.  Only 25million shares were issued in the IPO.  It spiked because no more shares were available for sale.  Now it's gonna tank as everyone who is paying attention takes profit.

For those retards not in the know, DWAC is Trump's SPAC, and it mooned from $9 to $144 in two days. Trading for that stock has been halted repeatedly

Yeah, you really need to learn to stop taking everything he does personally and looking for reasons to hate him. You don't know the whole picture of anything that's happened or is going on and you still keep wanting to think you do instead of checking yourself and researching some things.

You can see it however you want to see it, but your portfolio is telling you what's going on.

You need to stop this nonsense and stop holding grudges against a dude you think has harmed you in some way. Like, imagine having this big of a vendetta over some stuff he said a while back. Relax, dude. You haven't even met the guy, either.

Yeah, idiots.....

I just don't see it that way and I made some money trading on his tweets.

Maybe being a foreigner whose country he made fun of and had actions who personally affected my family, I see him in a different way. I just don't think politics is just about the money and I'm only here in the US to make money lol. And I don't even think he did a good job with the economy. He cut things that help people to save money, but then he spent it on the wall which is already falling apart.

Regardless, the US will never feel like home because everyone here is out for money and don't care about each other. It's not really a country, it's just a group of people living together.

What the fuck is mango

will it be halted for another half hour?

You're up roughly 150k.

Yea ill try. This is fucking wild

Fuck it, I‚Äôm out. Made a bunch. Jumped in yesterday morning first thing on the news. There‚Äôs no way this ends well and your options for exit are going to be limited. Never seen a halt last that long, and then get halted again 6 seconds after reopening. 

They‚Äôre gonna pull something today and it won‚Äôt be to our benefit.

There is a big regard push that's for sure.  But I don't think this has hit the mainstream yet.  Trump for all his faults has a lot of fans, and when options become available it is going to be nuts.

All this being said, it is at 130 now.  I don't think I'm going to buy in at this level, but I'm going to watch it closely and get in again if it dips to a "reasonable" level.

Was that technically a halt downwards on Mango?

Theory based on tin foil hat: it can either go the robinhood/GME way where they just kill the buy pressure to 'protect investors', or they realize they cant do that again because it would pull the curtain down, so theyre probably in conference calls with regulators trying to figure out what to do.

But it doesn‚Äôt actually mean someone will buy it at that price

Why halted forever?

How long can they actually halt DWAC?  Could it be all day?

I see that.
It‚Äôs common to see insanely high bid prices on stocks that disappear. Not sure why it happens.
What‚Äôs weird is that there‚Äôs no other bids

Targeting about $250 DWAC but even if not, imagine still being in $GME

You didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs on sale

Jokes on them. Due to supply chain issues there is a shortage of ladders ü™ú

got an email with an attachment asking me to pay $1000 to a certain online wallet. the body of the email is as follows

&gt;I want to ask how u have not chafed your hand till it bleeds? U jerk off so often that I think u have a particular technique, or it's unclear how your shaft is still okay. If u come across a man like u on the street, you won't think that, being alone, he practices that. Ur tenacity in ur creepy delights shocks me. But actually it's all is not related to our deal. When we're done, you would rather pay attention to you security, and begin at least covering the camera.
In case you defy my claims, within 90 hours u'd better get out of the country and change ur name, anyway u will no longer be able to live your former life. There is no other way, I am not going to review my requisitions, there's no use to text me, I'll delete the present email address. The timer starts now.

When the actual ticker goes live he'll make sure there are reverse stock splits through the ass to make it a 6 figure stock. Trump is very superficial so he'll want the highest stock price even if MC is trash compared to FB/AMZN/etc. It's all about the image of being successful/luxury without actually being so.

You either sell at the bottom or hold the bags long enough to become a value investor

A lot of the people are only just hearing about this and have either instant FOMO or buy stock to 'send a message'. Either way, you should totally get in and i'm totally not saying this cause i already bought and now i want to pump the stock

And once again Trump saved the US economy.

Because there is enough volume to play SPY daily. VOO is like once or twice a month expirations.

Honestly wondering the same

Fuck I bought DWAC at 23 and sold most of my stack at 43.

Yo, I can‚Äôt sell both of the shit I bought pre-market with Webull. The one stuck at $14 and the other stuck at $139. Are they gonna sell at that price after?

Daddy's gonna make the market great again

All I want is a 5% move on Tesla today &amp; CLF to ATH

Yeah, but at $14 I would have been more keen. But it‚Äôs way different from a $100+ price. At this point I might as well get calls on $TSLA and $COST instead.

SPY has the most OI for short term FDs. So fun to gamble!

This is blowing into the 150s the warrants are telling the story.

If it is then it'd have to be happening so fast that the volume isn't being reported from the exchanges to fidelity, so I'm thinking that its still the same halt. Warrants are still trading and they're up to 64 now lmao

The rug pull will be insane.

Averaged my dec 250 pypl calls down during that opening dip! Feels good, now I got damn near 30g‚Äôs in these calls so hopefully we start reversing today

Yep worried they may stop it

I had big regrets yesterday for not buying at 25 and 38, and now I sold a few other positions only to find out my broker don‚Äôt offer mango, I cheer for the lucky ones. This one seems like one of them you only see a few times in your trading life.

This rug pull is going to be brutal.

Truth Social and Facebook's correlation is actually less than -0.5 lol

Come on SPY don‚Äôt bitch out now. 456 today plz

Shares were already 10 baggers from 24 hours ago lol

Halts killing me

hmm I am not sure. never to late to change I guess

This is an unusually long halt.

And we are finally back at ATH. Hopefully the permabears have learned that it's best to pivot back and forth between bear and bull by now.

There are no options, there should be warrants(pretty similar to calls), just cheked there not. There are units sold, dwacu, but you need to check what's the redeption. DWACU = 1share DWAC + (1/2 OR 1/3 OR 1/4 OR 1)warant.

I thought volatility halts were only for 5 minute intervals. Is there a different halt time period if it happens in the first 41 seconds of open market?

Imagine where‚Äôd we be without Snap ruining the party

[removed]

I am sure you are not alone bro.

So in SNAPs earnings call they said companies were buying fewer ads because they were so supply constrained that there was no point in advertising to sell more.

Might just be SNAP making excuses, but this could also signal an overall downturn in revenue across the market

DWACW is a warrant contract stock on the underlying DWAC stock. A warrant is like an option contract, so think of DWACW as an option.

Apes buying Dwac is gonna be the event that makes the Sec 'regulate' retail stock trading because it has been 'gamified' and because it is 'too fun'.  Dems in control can't have people making money off of mango meme stocks.

I guess the answer is yes, you should have

Up 400% premarket.  Is this part of the mango hype?  Any truth to the association?

All these people buying dwac never played a spac, it‚Äôs going to dump on open isn‚Äôt it?

Edit: I was wrong, the buyers are stupider than I thought. The road to merger is going to be hilarious, so much loss porn probably.

What the fuck am I even looking at?

Agreed. Wait for the dip after early morning surge to buy more.

There are only like 36 million shares. I think there will be plenty of people willing to hold out of 74 million voters. Plus, Russia probably has half the shares.

Hey dumbass, it‚Äôs Friday. EOD = EOW

Puts on DWAC

it was being mentioned yesterday morning and afternoon. I bought in at $13 , sold at $25 , bough back in end of day at $40 or whatever

$102 now

This article is gibberish

Nope, cashed out at $72 this morning, I dun goofed.

Jesus, what even is your endgame???

I thought the only thing PDT designation does is prevent you from day trading for a certain amount of time if your account is below $25,000. If it‚Äôs above that you can day trade as much as you want. You‚Äôll get the ‚ÄúPDT‚Äù label after 4 days trades but it doesn‚Äôt mean anything before or after that point if you have $25k.

There was a 1500% turnover rate yesterday implying every single share on average was traded over 15 times.

Trump has literally 500 running businesses. Yeah, when you've opened up 500+ businesses, some are bound to fail, math genius. How many have *you* opened up? I bet I can guess the number!

You're comparing a dude with 500 businesses to a bunch of tech nerds only running a handful, on top of that.

Donald Trump has never opened a Tech business until now. Yeah, he'd be much higher on the totem pole on net worth if he had. But, why is net worth even *relevant*, here? You're literally just attacking the dude on every front possible with no actual point in sight. He opened up a tech business now and he'll likely gain a ton of net worth soon after that, judging by the stock's trend.

Like, what's the point of your whole shtick, here? Orange Man is Bad therefore everything he does is bad? Is that it? Are you sure you're looking at this with critical objectivity or are you just yet another mindless drone consumed with superficial hatred? And I'm supposed to believe you, a random dude on the Internet, just because you "work in the industry" related to what he's doing with no evidence anywhere to be found? Be serious.

Why‚Äôs there only one fire exit ??

Dwac wowzers

I was told I was getting banned because a certain stock was under $90, and I couldn‚Äôt mention it.

Purely on speculation...but we're playing.

Yea I saw that they cut guidance ahead of earnings. I guess they figure if they get ahead of the bad news they will get a bump from actual earnings.

And when it has gone past, I will turn my inner-eye to see its path

When the FOMO is gone there will be nothing, only my account will remain.

Yuuuuge profit taking dump at open I bet too.

Shocking, honestly

It's about making money dawg, not about morality or politics or business practices.

Early investors in DWAC are pulling out after they learn Trump is behind it.  Apparently his involvement was very well shielded to attract investors.  None of the hedge funds want to be associated with a fake news platform (their words)  Saba Capital and another anonymous 10% stakeholder divested from the company yesterday as news broke that it was Trump's social media platform.

A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica which is believed to have originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two distinct types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type". Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.  
  
Worldwide, there are several hundred cultivars of mango. Depending on the cultivar, mango fruit varies in size, shape, sweetness, skin color, and flesh color which may be pale yellow, gold, green, or orange.The mango is the national fruit of India, Pakistan and the Philippines, while the mango tree is the national tree of Bangladesh.

Look kiddies.  This is your opportunity to stop being a whiny baby and to flip a meme stock into owning a home.  Bought the gme hype train back in Jan. for huge gains that helped with a home downlayment.  You have chance #2 here with Dwac.   Or you can just clutch your panties and continue to wait in the sideline because you think it is already 'too late' then go pump common dreams garbage articles in other subs that whine about the housing market prices and young people being priced out and bitching that we need govt to take over housing.  Get creative trying to own a home or wallow in your bitchfest.

But Intel's not just a cpu company

It's a SPAC and all these assholes should be banned.

Pro tip buy mango

I think Gabs issue is the left - not to get political just describing users - don't have the numbers on Gab to diversify it so you don't have echo chambers for the left so the left end up seeing the right.

Now imagine if Gab was as large as Twitter the posts would be so numerous that echo chambers would develop. Twitter has a shit ton of nazis they are just within their echo chamber just like the antifa tribe are in theirs. You have to seek it out or be part of the community to see it.

That's the drawback of social platforms is that echo chambers are safe spaces. If people don't have them they feel attacked. If they do have them you end up with a cycle of content where hate breeds hate because their is no counter argument. So instead of seeing people you end up seeing an attribute and you no longer want to help the person you only see hate.

That is called situational design and it is fundamentally what is wrong with social currently. It's a cess pool of both extremes breeding hate against each other.

The wall will be teared down, it will be more badass than the fall of the Berlin wall.

Damn, sometimes we miss out over here.   I will put that on my bucket list.

This is beautiful watching it jump up and down 5 and 10 dollars at a time.

Usually dips of 10 % + of such a big company for basically no good reason, will rebound sooner or later. I also have an eye on Novax in this regard....but I think. I try.

Dont think that Intel will go bankrupt because of AMD or NVDA. And as you mentioned ...people will buy

Lawsuits are a literal part of being a businessman. You think Facebook and Apple don't regularly face lawsuits over alleged plagiarism and whatnot? 

You need to chill tf out and reassess your obsession with this dude. He's a top businessman, backed by financial investors who already have seen his business plans. You are not a financial expert with secret knowledge. You are an everyday citizen, like me, posting on a forum. Humble yourself.

Sure, in your shoes Google is a much better choice. However for brick and mortar retail locations and ecommerce I've found Facebook's pixel to be a much more powerful tool that leads to much cheaper conversions. To 100% generalize that it's not even working on instagram thots is just incorrect.

The rest of this nonsense isn't even relevant to the discussion. You don't even know anything about the platform, if it's not here yet. How could you know? You're just another TDS ranter and I don't care for it.

I was thinking of staying away from ü•≠ app but with sub $2B market cap (for now) you have to think that even a niche Twitter or Snapchat type offering, even if only half as good, still has a lot of room to run.

Wait, the fact it's three weeks old... A lawsuit... A three week old lawsuit? You're pointing out there it's three weeks old? You realize it hasn't started yet right? So you think DWAC or truth didn't exist three weeks ago?

Okay, let's actually break down how dumb what you're saying is. I've worked as a tech lead on several of the platforms he's trying to recreate... Do you know what the salary for a fresh grad at these companies is? Over 200k, a senior is probably making $500k or more. There's no way, this cheapskate could ever afford a single decent engineer. Thus why his site has already been hacked.

The whole platform is built off of an open source project that's already suing him. From a technical standpoint, this app will literally suck.i know that. You know that. That's why he's begging for his Twitter back, because truth is going to be an unusable pills of shit

DWAC gonna put Twitter out of business

GME just doesn't care. They dump it with full force, but can't keep it low for long right now. Apes bought the dip once again

I paper handed my spy calls at close after scalping the last dip of the, so obviously we opening like +.35%

Some smart people are going to make a lot of money with this and even more are going to lose their ass. I know I fuck up entries and exits on the regular so I'll just enjoy the show.

Mangos will rot badly

From a jealous guy who is watching on the sidelines

I'm sure they'll be a sell off, but then people that just heard about it last night will be buying in I'm sure. I just can't do it because I won't be able to buy &amp; sell shares today (since I don't have margin yet) and don't want to hold them until next week

There‚Äôs a good documentary about what happened on The Crow, I‚Äôll try to find it for you and it explains the process of making a mass amount of blank rounds for a movie set and also making dummy rounds for other shots in the movie with no powder and how it can get mixed up.

COCO went public yesterday.  The company makes tons of cash and it has positive earnings with PE around 20 and it is growing fast internationally. This is a buy stock. Currently is discounted to its IPO price from yesterday. It should go up 10% or more per day until it doubles IPO price. By the way Dr Pepper also bought a huge chunk of the shares at the IPO price of $15.

When I say everyone I‚Äôm saying a huge Majority of the people on this world use Snapchat. Look at the numbers of users is you have to. I don‚Äôt understand how you are arguing against that. Called me dumb but it sounds like you‚Äôre a fucking moron. Here let me give you an award so you feel better .

You guys know FOMOing with stocks is way safer than FOMOing with options by simple fact of stop loss mechanisms on less radical price shifts?

Feel free to throw your house into Mango stock. Just set a stop loss.

Buy puts then. I am talking about day trading and I see it rebounding a little bit rather than falling further. FB isn‚Äòt as fucked as SNAP.

EDIT: It sadly rebounded too much already (+15$) since the drop so I probably stand away from that trade for now as it‚Äòs pretty much sitting in the middle of the range from yesterdays close and AH drop.

We are witnessing the greatest pump and dump ever in real-time.  No idea what price this Trump SP AC can hit, but anything is possible with the volume we saw yesterday.

Would not be surprised at all if it hits triple digits today.

This is like if BYND, TLRY, (or name any other vertical play) happened in a few days instead of a few weeks.

it will eventually lmao. anyone who really thinks this is going to continue much past 100 doesnt have a clue. actually idk, 100 is a pretty strong psychological price point, if it breaks 100 it might legit go another 15%. but I don't expect it to go GME insane

Intel -10% premarket - is it worth getting some? I don't really like the company but I don't mind a discount.

Spanx looks incredibly uncomfortable

I posted my theory about what was going to happen. If they can‚Äôt capture ad revenue when usage it at an all time high is doomed. 

$SNAP is going to Snap
What‚Äôs up fellow apes? I‚Äôve got some luke warm speculation that may become boiling hot in the coming months. And what is that? It is the fact that $SNAP is over valued ‚Ä¶ tremendously. They‚Äôve been hovering at an all time high for quite some time. We all know it‚Äôs a dying app. Instagram and Tik tok are taking over their usage, not users, but usage. Public Snap data provides active users based on number of users who open their application within a 24 hour window and not the amount of time spent on the app. Which, I feel would mislead advertisers because personally I open Snap for less than 4 minutes a day. I assume it is the same for others. 

There‚Äôs a bigger factor at play here. The COVID Effect. How long do we think the average user is spending on the app? These users, especially the young ones, haven‚Äôt been in school or have been working from home which provides them the freedom to use their phone without consequences. Average time spent on the app by users HAS to be on the decline as the world reopens. There‚Äôs a reason why they don‚Äôt share this data with advertisers. 

So, if the average time spent on the app by user is on the decline, then their sole source of revenue, advertising, would likely be on the decline or advertisers would be sceptical of using their platform. 

Also, has anyone seen click through ads on other platforms that open up Snap? I have on on Twitter and Instragram. That seems like a Hail Mary if I‚Äôve ever heard of one. 

Earnings call is coming up this month which is expected to be positive for the first time. Don‚Äôt let it fool you. Or, maybe I‚Äôm a fool. So take this DD with a grain of salt.

Upstart is only down because of an analyst calling it overvalued when it reached $400. But still a pretty damn good growth company and with profits.

You bet I did

Agreed. Way more pros to stop losses than cons.

The only sad part is that you bears keep praying for a crash thats not coming lol

So reminiscent of trump making my portfolio move up and down

ah ur right, I didn't even think about halts

At this rate they will be back in a couple years

I would have commented *gift if I didn't agree with you.  Damn such a good line squandered

They're not always your friend with volatile stocks. If a stock gets halted and then drops instantly, your stop loss may fuck you over big time as the executed price might be extremely low, way under what you wanted. And then you see your shit sold at the lowest point and then the price bounces back (or deadcats) and you wanna smash your screen.

With 400% gains, I am thinking it gets dumped at 930am as soon as everyone comes online.  All the PDT restricted will dump first thing and take gains.  Then maybe buy back in again if it drops.  I missed out on mango yesterday and don't trust you f&amp;ckers to not dump first thing, lol.  But never underestimate the power of the MANGO, so who knows

But, why you mad? ü§î

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Chocostick27 (0/1) made a bet that ASML would go to 820.0 when it was 790.72 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

I don‚Äôt think it will fuck FB Twitter

Not even instagram anymore. TicTok,

Yeah, I saw that when I did a search.

Three weeks old. But, let's talk about it, I guess.

Nobody knows exactly why Mango wanted his Twitter back. Could have been for a number of reasons. Could have been giving them a last shot before he ripped their faces off in the market. Could have needed some data or code from them to fuel his own platform ideas. I don't know. You don't know. "Get his account back" implies he wanted to rejoin the platform. No, he just wanted his account reinstated. That's not necessarily a plea to come back to the platform, on his knees and teary eyed.

But, think about it for like a minute. Why *would* Mango want his Twitter restored while he's in the middle of making his own platform, with deals already lined up behind him for financial support? If you want to go brain dead and just say, "Hurr durr, it's cuz he's stoopid," then it's no wonder you folks lose money.

These are important questions we need to be asking, instead of jumping to conclusions that support our own bias for or against him.

It was a red headline one their app yesterday. They mentioned it and everyone is hopping on board! Nobody‚Äôs selling and retail owns the float!

There are other subs on Reddit. Didn‚Äôt say WSB

Either buy now or FOMO at 400 sir!

Meme stocks on Webull. 4am to 8pm

don‚Äôt let that guy meet your wife

Yes. My point is, this stonk has exceeded past mentions when GME was hot.

Does anyone know what the record for most shares traded in a day is?

Doggy coin, a completely worthless coin driven by Elon fans, sustained 32bn market cap. Think about it.

Gonna wait to see what it does within the first hourish but it‚Äôs definitely going back up no way it stays at these prices. Solid earnings EVERYONE uses snap i feel like it‚Äôs easy mid to late nov calls

SNAP SNIP SNAP

$10k isn't really a crazy market cap.

Lmao how is that even possible, we‚Äôre the largest ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù subreddit and SPACs aren‚Äôt allowed.

I see no news about Mango trying to get back on Twitter.

Exit the echo chamber. You'll live longer.

Good idea to buy shares pre market of the mango or nah?

DWAC 10,000,000 is not a meme!

News 

More than 470 million shares of DWAC changed hands during Thursday's session, according to FactSet. In comparison, SPY, the exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&amp;P 500, only traded about 32 million shares.

FAKOFFF

I‚Äôll give you a grand if it does

Nah they all getting banned lmaaooooo

Mango is coming to save the GREAT AMERICAN ECO NOMY

Anyone else buying SNAP at open? Got to be a little in it short term. Such a big hit

Ban

Trump just banned Biden from his social media platform.  Biden responded back with, "But I just yoloed into DWAC".

I'm no fancy money man but I'm pretty sure the SNAP earnings selloff means the for-pay feet pic accounts I sub to will drop their prices by 20%.

Quarantine thread please

What an absolute roller coaster of a week. I‚Äôve worked for a startup for 3 years that burns money at a good rate. Two weeks ago we almost run out of money, and a new investor comes in to rescue us. He gives us this rah rah speech saying he put in hundreds of thousands of dollars to get everyone paid up through the year, and has a 5 hour meeting with us establishing quarterly goals.  Comes back in on Monday and has the same type of meeting with us. 

Tuesday that mother fucker holds an emergency board meeting and calls a vote to liquidate which passes 9:1. For two days I‚Äôm scrambling trying to find a new income.

Thursday that brilliant mother fucker resigns from the board, and offers to buy the company for pennies on the dollar. Offer has to be accepted legally due to the liquidation.

I get banned today any way.  Going to lose a bet.

GME went to \~30B market cap, that's well over 10x from here

The best market

I already have a banbet for SBUX for next Friday, but COST has been on a monster run this week üôÉ

Yesterday‚Äôs I switched my NVDA calls for UPST calls and legit UPST is only red since and NVDA is only green since. How am I this unlucky and retarded ?

I wonder if all these idiots know that there's gonna be a huge ban wave because they are too stupid to fucking read the rules.

Anybody buying the FB and Intel dips?

uhh ok ur point? still couldn't hit $500 just like how DWAC won't come close to that either

Gap up on Monday, because over the weekend it will gain a lot more attention. That's how it worked for GME, and for NEGG.

We all know spy went up for like a year straight. This is not time to buy puts this is still time to buy calls. Spy had its jaw dropping 2 months almost of straight dropping. Remember what happened before sept

One more reason to support a TRUTH social media.

If you get fucked I win big so, I think you‚Äôre fucked

Even with the pointless pickles plot line and disappointing last episode bojack season 6 was some of the best TV ever made.  Feel old already saying this but netflix just doesn't have it anymore as demonstrated by people's obsession with squid game, which was just ok at best.

DWAC. This thing is going to 500. Think digital money. Think doggy coin. Everyone looking at MARKET CAP.

If the market is going full retarded you have to go full retarded too. If you only go half retarded you're done for.

GME, AMC and Doggy coin can all sustain ridiculous valuation because a TAM of idiots fanatically support it.

The new valuation metric is: TAM of idiots/market cap and boy is DWAC undervalued

“Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed upbeat as she returned from the White House, telling reporters she believed a deal was within reach, though repeatedly declining to say whether it could happen today. She also declined to say whether the House could vote on either the social spending bill or the Senate-passed infrastructure bill next week, remarking only that "I'm very optimistic."

Bull. Shit.

Could have made 30% today if I hadn’t gotten greedy and FOMO’d into the 🥭 stock.

Instead, I’m up 8%.

MSFT, old buddy, gimme one last pump on Monday to help me make up for my failures.

I do spreads so it works both ways. 450% return if it closes above $58 so I’ll take those odds.

Why ? 100% gain today wasn’t good enough ?

99% of the daily lost good money today and it's palpable. The excuses are flooding in already.

Got into DWAC at 27 yesterday, bailed at 38 and was happy with a modest gain. Gut said buy back in at 44 and then scared money lost out on money when I bailed at 44 right before the bell.

Trailing stop losses are your friend.

I’m saying, if you think it was an over reaction then it would bounce back quick. You went in the money and far expiration. Why if you think it was just an over reaction? If it’s just that then it wouldn’t be seen as a risk to go out of the money.

Thanks you too. 😘

My first red day in 10 days. Feels bad man. FOMO is the worst

If you think it was an over reaction then why didn’t you buy calls that were out of the money around the price before it dropped. Like $75? I don’t think you have confidence in your own statement. you paid a good amount for those way out in the money calls. Lot cheaper for the $75 calls. Doesn’t make sense.

Bought warrants last night during AH. Sold all during PM then day-traded the warrants. Called it a day around noon and moved it all into amzn shares for earnings next week. Currently getting gaped lol

Cmon MARA let’s see you back above 50

What’s awesome is only truth is allowed so you’ll be able to 100% trust whatever anyone on there says. It’s genius.

Holy shit you actually made the sub

Load up. Bad news will come out all weekend

Made some of the worst trades of my life over the past 2 weeks, sending all my TSLA gains to zero

[removed]

I sold my shares at $130 but the market was halted, so when it un halted the price jumped to $175. So my sell orders went through for $175. I didn’t even do a limit order LOL

good to see China stocks bout getting popular again - funny how the memes change aint it? Amost like the meme-freaks got no minds.

Why don't you kidz give up Twitter and WSB and just ask Alexa what to invest in?

&lt;[bet you think I'm joking dont ya](https://youtu.be/tMnGmoLS6zo)\&gt;

What’s up with this fucking 🥭 stock ? Only up 100% today ? What am I supposed to do with these little gains? I want 350% Monday or I’m canceling my subscription to ivankas onlyfans

This isnt a 2.5T cap stock like aapl.

Really? Is it a myth or something?

Mango is holding strong.  For how high it's ripped, that's pretty bullish for Monday.

It's over

why tf is AAPL not going up

If you don't know what it is then you haven't been paying attention the last 2 days

No shares available to me unfortunately.

I pulled a u/cashflow_ and got 3 spy puts

Cut your losses. This thing isn’t going to move drastically anymore

Snapchat a snal 75b market cap company tanked nasdaq  and shaved off hundreds of thousands of dollars of company like google fb

Kinda crazy lowkey

Riot will either make or break me next week

$ME gonna be the talk of the town next week

That Nov 3 taper, though... MMs will take advantage of the dear and pocket something. Only works if there's red to play with.

Not holding anything short term over the weekend. Mango mania was enough this week. Will evaluate next moves on Monday.

If there is a god, SPY will drop by a dollar in the next ten minutes

The IV on SNAP is absurd. If you're bullish on it, buy shares.

Leave WSB and keep working your day job. Buy boring shit.

Whos shorting dwac/dwacw

So what’s the consensus on SNAP? Seems like it will rebound soon but I’m looking for other opinions

retail don't move shit, if you're worth anything you were part of the original wave

opened the account and did not want to add funds unless sure I was able to buy options

no funds is no margin

Bought $XHP jan 23 55 puts.

Mangos arnt even orange why tf isn’t donnie called orange like what am I missing

DWAC is consolidating nicely if I do say so myself...

Mango is still up close to 100% on the day 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️

Stop halting AUPH you cowards

Can’t blame them 🤷‍♂️

Low amount of shares to trade vs the demand for the shares. Aka low liquidity

10 bucks says this is false propaganda 

"On Friday, the world’s most indebted property developer made an $83.5 million interest payment to bondholders, according to Securities Times, an official newspaper. The outlet, which is backed by People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s official newspaper, didn’t offer further details.
The payment came with just one day left on a 30-day grace period to avoid a default. The company gripped global financial markets a month ago when it skipped a payment to foreign bondholders, raising the prospect that it could leave global investors with billions of dollars in losses and cause ripples within China’s property market, a key component of the country’s economic growth engine."

Wish I waited for a dip to buy my call option lol

Why is NIO not mooning like TSLA?

The Reddit for it had people complaining about their market orders filling at 150+. Lol

Went to GameStop the other day and literally nothing has changed. Still same empty store with ass trade in offers. Wtf is corporate doing with all the money we provided them? And don’t say NFT bc we know damn well that’s not their space

&gt; You can't give me anything.

TSLA puts locked in, going to be in a lambo or going to be a hobo

This is why you hold 0DTEs until close

It’s a classic pyramid scheme, how many more idiots can join in at this price?

Sometimes I gotta remind myself that this is what I asked for, I didn’t quit my job to be a pussy and beg for help, I quit cause I have the balls necessary to pull 153% every day. Here’s to being drunk way before I should be!

No joke. Idk if everyone is putting on their boomer pants or what. As someone still in college, almost every person you meet and socialize with will add you on Snapchat. Snapchat stories are also HUGE in the youth. These SNAP bears have to be 40+ years old to not see that Snapchat is nowhere near dead.

Sooo who bought SNAP call FDs at open?

Time to dump.

SPY you fucking bitch

ATH 10/29 book it

When a halt upward occurs it’s to prioritize the sell orders in que first.  A lot of times this causes a panic sell off and kills the momentum.  When halted downwards the buys in que are prioritized first, attempting to slow the sell off.

And no cuddles after

Spy is going to close at 453.10 and then premarket before Monday takes it to 453.80. No one will know what to do about it.

Do not miss your chance to blow, this opportunity comes only once in a lifetime...

Yes, No, No

lmao yeah it’s totally someone else’s fault that you chose to buy in

Yup. Crazy how some people go on and on about how it's not a good business model, no products, site is gonna be easily hacked, etc over the other subs. 

Anyone who is thinking about holding this SPAC long term, I worry about you...The SPAC cycle is not meant for long term hold. LMAO.

Maybe in about 10 years it will get back to $172

I like that guy MARK.  He's pretty cool.  Probably going to hang out this weekend.

Yeah, I’m aware of that. It’s not pure arb, but the absurd spread (which is more than the price of DWACW) will probably go down next week

Anyone else picking up SNAP calls? Seems like any bounce next week and these things print.

I’m in on calls. Average price target is $140 by EOY. Most of these guys here got burned or have puts. It will run

It’s pretty simple. He’s not going to jail. The armorer or prop master on set were responsible for making sure the prop gun was safe to use, and they failed their job.

Hi! Mr. Catfish here reminding you that it doesn’t count as a day trade if you sell and then buy a ticker in the same day &lt;3

No one actually believes that. They just bought the top and are trying to convince some suckers to take their bags.

To take retail’s money

Ive learned pretty quick to stay away from this space when options trading. Just do you own dd and dont play weeklys. Look farther out and buy closer itm calls.

The economy is already broken. You can make more money buying and selling imaginary value, than making things people actually need.
This is a great example of that.

Right. Hate it man and usually it picks up immediately AFTER you sell. If you're going with calls I'll start with a few then double down if it dips more, that's what I should've did but went all in at once

Anyone buying FB calls for next week?

Bear traps are set. Have a nice weekend. See you all next week. Hope as exciting as this week.

I feel like it’ll drop a bit but how much is the question hmm

So much free money right now. You would have to be an idiot not to buy calls on GME AMC and SDC at these prices.

I hope these are up 20% for you next week.

One of the few times an acquirer goes up on acquisition announcement

I love me some 🥭right now, good price before After hour and Monday launch.

Could have bought Puts on GME and AMC however, thinking that all those Apes would be selling to move in mangoes...

Both down around 7%....

You should find a different hobby or something to distract/de-stress you. Emotion is the enemy when trading

You do realize FB has already been hit by the same news right? FB owns 91 companies - many over $1b worth - not to mention, Instagram alone might be worth the same as snap. Snap owns a dozen companies, and I guarantee you can’t name one without googling.

No smart money is risking it from this point on a company that doesn’t exist. Ape vs Ape isn’t sending it rocketing. GME was over 100% shorted big money HAD to buy to cover their ass. No one has to buy shit for 🥭. 

Gladly bet you 100$ Sent via PayPal that it doesn’t touch 200 in the next week.

Selling my mango stock at $12.90 makes me feel like one of those old fucks who's glory years passed them by still thinking about the big high school game where they blew out their arm.

0DTE calls were NOT the move

Nothing like seeing a buncha bag holders being born before your eyes.

It'll dip some more before a recovery just don't sell before it does. I bought NKE after their earnings drop last month and it kept dipping. Had 01/22 160 calls sold for a 40% loss now those calls are ITM and would've been a 180% gain

To qualify there are trading requirements it needs to maintain for a few (\~5) days in a row. CBOE website has a list.

No one talking about SNAP calls. Your supposed to buy when stocks are down. Not when they are up 500% already.

I bought 460s but I'm fucking stupid so take that with a grain of salt

It’s like pump and dump inception here today.

"Though many investors have worried over how stocks will react when the Fed begins to taper its $120 billion in monthly government bond purchases, the so-far sanguine trading in the options market suggests that market participants are not rushing to buy insurance against volatility over the next few weeks."

That is so bearish. Dips don't happen when everyone is hedged, they happen when nobody is....

And look at him now. 🥴

Hmm. CRTX carrying the portfolio today. strange times

Yeah I do I’m a scarily angry human being

I think a lot of people will be crying if they do $15billion per month. Down $45billion in just three months. Sorry but that’s gonna make a difference.

Ok now wait 30 seconds and turn it back on

Hmmm. Dumping all my money into GME because the number was 69.69 seemed reasonable at the time

Possible before biden annouces infa bill this weekend

I just checked and I got a $50k/12.7%/3Y or $25k/6.9%/3Y. 

But the process does look like bullshit.

The greatest and the bestest power hour I’ve ever seen

Sold all but 1 share in case it does some crazy shit next week. But I'm pretty sure the top is in.

I cashed out last time it was over $3400. It doesn't stay above there very long. TSLA is the mover.

Smells like monkey sex in here

This is what every bubble looks like. Dot com bubble you had doctors and lawyers shutting down their firms to become day traders. You had tons of fake investment gurus and advisors pop up. People were paying absurd prices for stupid shit like beanie babies, like they are for pokemon cards and NFTs today. This shit is def gonna burst at some point. It's just probably not going to be until rates actually go up so who knows how big it can get before then.

I'll buy more when options are out

Supply chain crisis + worker shortage + multiple strikes + stagflation fears = SPY goes down

DWAC is the trump unmute button. Worst case I lose half my monies. What’s 500 bucks and a banbet ban

It makes sense - if people shorted it, theyll cover the last thirty minutes or hour, and then it makes the stock look primed for another run so they can short it again Monday.

Watch SPY close at 453.99 to fuck all the 0 day 454c holders

Probably not too deep considering the sag factor.

Come on SPY don’t cuck me like that

What's your move for Monday?

Internationally most people like him, but obviously it depends where. Other governments like him for his foreign policy/so do a lot of the people. Like I said, the media misconstrues a-lot, and I say that without being biased. My family is from Italy so that is why I have a pretty good understanding of how’s he’s seen. 

Especially right now a lot of people are looking for a platform that isn’t overly censored and I think that’s the main driving force if it’s successful

Why are people buying other SPAC stock linked to Patrick Orlando. In case that also has a mango flavour? Or do you know for sure it’s also Infused with the fruit?
Seems cheap if there’s an announcement (can’t find one).
If not.. Might be worth a rogue share. YOLO.

Mind cuck- DWAC, new stonk, early adopters. Can be discussed on WSB but no media coverage for Donald trump. DWAC starts to trend on WSB (You are here). Media decides to start to cover Trump more. Institutional investor and big companies support the SPAC. Sell the news and profit.

Also for the actual restriction, yes, have a $25k balance.

January 2021 vibes all over again and we all know where those SPACs are now. Can’t save people from themselves, let them have their fun while it lasts. Opening it up just makes this sub a target for P&amp;Ds and spam, but once again, people seem to love that shit

Yeah bro. Blank check shell companies going 17x in in 2 days isn’t extreme enough for you??

Who are you to say which company is and ain’t legit? Let the market decide. AMC is just as much of a pump and dumb as Mango IMO. 

Personally with more than 70 million people who voted for him, I think 🥭 will actually be successful. I think in 5 years it will be a $1 trillion company. Has huge potential to grow and compete with not only social media, but Netflix, AWS, and Apple.

call it lemon something, already have tards pumping you

I like how when Burger King called the cops on me for asking for a refund everyone just assumed it was my fault. For all you know I ordered chicken nuggets and they were like "oops! All breading!" I didn't say what was wrong, it could have been a rat in my burger. It could have been burger king foot lettuce and y'all still would have memed on me. It's not fair and I'm gonna cry some more about it

what the fuck? is WSB now allowing pump and dumps? where are the mods? are they in the scam too?

After a target is announced maybe? Pre-announcement discussion is a lot of target speculation and conspiracy.

If your SPAC never merges you have to give the money back after 2 years.

10k times 5 into intc? 

UPVOTE FOR YES 

DOWNVOTE FOR NO

Oh shit, I didn’t know about those all failing. I heard about Gab before though. I do see a growth problem domestically and definitely internationally. That will sting being a public company.

I understand, my other issue is I think it’s user base has a growth problem. Anything linked to Trump will lose out on a lot of growth. Take a look at his hotel business losing lots of revenue. They say divest from your businesses because you’ll lose half the country. Plus he’s hated internationally so that will hurt as well. Maybe app banned in EU? 🤷‍♂️

Might as well allow them if they are above a certain market cap. It is WSB, for making stupid plays.

&gt; Yes

Man, are they gonna make sure s&amp;p is green today?

Not when there is no basis for the the hype. Mango had a basis, news, and it’s cap came above limit. 

These new ones are straight pump and dump SEC oversight of the sub territory. Nothing but the CEO’s name attached driving them and word of mouth here.

people underestimate trump, that doesn't mean these are pump and dumps, has no bearing on the success of the app long term .

Well intel looks like free money as in Jan they are releasing their gpu lineup. So they would have to fuck up royally to blow this away. But I guess given how good AMD is with their cpu lineup it might be correct. Still I’m bullish on intel until jan dGPU release.

MAQC grabbing a good amount right now.

So there's a problem with the way we detect and block SPACS: it isn't automated. We just manually flag them as spacs in our DB if we know about them ahead of time or remember to. I'm retarded so you can guess how well that works.

What do you think, should we just allow them if they're above the right market cap (1.5b)? That might mean that you have to deal with the bot being an asshole about the market cap if it's not updating as per TDAmeritrade or Polygon.io though.

the thought of buying more stocks because of inflation is going to get you broke.

Shoutout to my boy BENE

Yesterday premarket

I would say NVDA is safer as they have an absolutely massive moat, especially when it comes to AI. Less competition too (as you know, there are a trillion EV companies.)

I'd say that it has the best chance out of any company right now, based on growth and demand.

More investments to consider: AMZN, GOOGL, COIN, BABA, DIS.

I'm not trying to steer you one way or another, but I worked my way up to a significant amount of money before and blew it up, thinking it was impossible. 

I learned a lot and I'm currently working my way back up, but it's tough and nothing is a guarantee, especially in this market. Please don't be like me.

Regardless, best of luck.

reeee idk why the bot isn't blocking BENE but it's low cap spam, please do not discuss while I figure out wtf is going on

How many meme contenders do you have to own at once to actually have a chance of being in when these things moon? Or is it simply a case of jumping on a moving train early enough? I got lucky with GME and made a small bit recently with BB, but these f\* Trump pumps were well out the gate before I got in. When did all the chat hit about DWAC? Before or AH last night?

Shares filled just before halt, feeling about this

Well it's the SECs job to investigate and define that. A stock going +1000% in 2 days isn't going to be caused by just a bunch of redditors. But currently the definition is "whatever they feel like investigating" which seems to be actually nothing, and the retail holders and redditors are the ones that get fucked in the end.

If by “those people”, you mean not a desperate poor, yes… that is correct

if you're 24 and think this ride is going to last forever, you have a lot of growing up to do. You should be developing a hard/technical skill so when the show stops you can have a job. Otherwise your earnings are going to attrite back into the economy as a means of supporting yourself - and that's if you have the foresight to save it in the meantime. If you're frivolously spending it with the expectation that "I could do this forever" then you'll be sorely disappointed whenever that day comes. Either way I wish you the best of luck but don't think it's going to be this easy forever.

MACQuaker is free money 🥭👀🚀🚀🚀

Made 48k off 10 calls after i factor taxes and paying some medical bills off. Literally turned 1 mortgage payment into 35ish over the course of a month of holding the calls. It was a good day.

any guaranteed 10 baggers today?

Just FOMOed into DWAC @104. WISH ME LUCK

LOL. You call that focus ? Dude can’t focus on saying a sentence. He’s got 100’s of container ships backed up in ports and empty grocery shelves. He’s too focused on giving lady boys positions of power to get anything done.

How safe is NVDA of an investment? I feel like the growth for TSLA the next decade is as safe as it gets. New giga factories coming online this year. FSD. I don’t need 1000% gains to become rich. A solid 10-20% YOY gains would get me rich. 

Is NVDA future 1T market cap company?

Making enough money these last few weeks to the point I don’t even need to work a day job (I’m 24 also) and can take my family on vacation/help them out has made me realize that it’s true that money doesn’t create happiness, but I am glad that I have more freedom and can help those close to me out/make their lives better

Everyone says “well you have to wait a year”

I mean so does stock???? It’s not like stock gives immediate dividends every second you hold. You are still just hoping people continue to buy it 

Seems insane how far warrants are from their valuation. Why not just go back down if the stock does as well?

Moral of the story, never ever, ever ever under any circumstance, buy Pltr

Not a shot.

Just realize that for every person who does that and posts it there are probably &gt;10x as many people who overall lose money on their option trades.  


Also realize that when someone shows the $150 -&gt; $2k play they likely lost money on their other trades leading up to that point

If u ain't selling DWAC before close I don't think anything can save you

His first year (2001) he was up 55%. When he was up a “measly” 18% the entire market tanked 22%. You’re right, that’s average. I’m sure every hedge fund was hitting those same numbers. Also you mentioned he sold his gme, he didn’t sell it all before the takeoff, he just sold enough to not have to report his position to the sec. he owned like 10% of the company at the beginning. You can go ahead and stay salty and ignore facts, I’m sure that at the end of the day when he’s rubbing 100 dollar bills on his balls he will care about your wrong opinion.

Do some shrooms, try again next week.

If people knew this information, why would they ever invest in any other company? Everybody would invest in the same company. You either get lucky or you don’t. Pretty simple.

Personally, no, I’d be interested at $40. Definitely could recover back to $69-70 but would be a head and shoulders and get taken back out to the wood shed

If you look at the HQ buildings in Santa Clara/Silicon Valley, it starts to make sense why INTC is such a dumpster fire. Why would anyone want to work in such a dull, outdated and vastly inferior workplace? Compare their headquarters to NVDA HQ for example. That place is likely to attract top talent. AAPL HQ, same thing. If I’m basing investments on that criteria, FB r fuk too. 

Who’s got the coolest headquarters in tech?

Okay!!!!! I’d take it

Everyone with 🦍 in their flair is excited about 🥭. For that reason, I’m out

No. I keep it in my brokerage, but I have a very hard time spending money on “fun” shit. So with these gains it makes it easier on me to treat myself a couple times a year.

More like BAN and the Jets

it better beat spy lol if a hedge fund doesn't beat spy it should shutter itself that's the entire point of a hedge fund

from what i'm looking at scion's returns are nothing special compared to other hedge funds. had a good year due to the big short, but aside from that he had two years with 40%+ returns (one 45% and one 40%) and the next highest was a 13% return and the lowest was an 18% loss (these are numbers from its original operation, not the past 8 years since he reopened). obviously he's a good enough trader to be successful and professional, but he's not some market genius lol his notoriety so far outweighs his actual understanding of the economy

Lol why would Fox News back a competitor?

But look at the fibonacci.....

Banbet also gives $100 apparently

I've been working on a model that assigns ban costs given a certain percent target and time maturity. I.e AAPL up 1.5% in 1 week deserves a 2month ban given that it is very likely. or MSFT being down 20% in one month deserves 2 or so weeks since it is unlikely. I am still working out the thresholds because we don't the ban cost to be super low for unlikely events because that would just flood the bets with unlikely events given the cost is so low. I am also trying to figure out the optimal minimum and maximum ban lengths so I could tweak them based on your requirements. Would this be something you would consider?

We shall see my friend.

&gt;	The transaction values Trump Media &amp; Technology Group at an initial enterprise value of $875 Million, with a potential additional earnout of $825 Million in additional shares (at the valuation they are granted) for a cumulative valuation of up to $1.7 Billion depending on the performance of the stock price post-business combination. 

Depending on the meaning of the valuation they are granted, this could very well mean that DWAC represents only 15% of the actual Trump social network’s valuation, which would make Trump’s share worth ***$20 billion***. We truly live in incredibly dumb times

Also SNAP is free money at this point. If it goes lower, average down, but this is stealing its so easy. This market loves to overreact

BENE actually seems to be profit-making business already, too. I mean Trumpo's buds are not dumb, right? Surely they can cobble together a decent social media platform??? Entertaining anyway, regardless of what happens to Phunware and DWAC. Go Trump Media![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)

Yesterday's ER painted a diff sorry and the impact was much greater than anticipated. Again, bc Snap was ILL PREPARED. They're didn't develop tools for better advertising engagement. FB and GOOG have been ahead of the curve and will be LESS impacted

He was also the one who discovered the gme moass, so I’d say he’s 2 for 2

The market’s entire viability right now consists of faking out retail on violent dips in the market so they sell their stock cheap/buy puts, then heading straight back up. If you can’t beat them, join them.

yeah i dunno how this is such a story every time. rebalancing. tho she'd probably be better off letting tsla ride and stop pouring money into the rest of that dogshit portfolio

This has the potential to run bigly from here.  Float is so low.  Huge huge TAM plus very very committed supporters.  Unironically I think its undervalued 10x easily.

See spy calls is the way. Significant dips are bought up 100% of the time these days. It’ll go down another 30-40 cents and then back into green to finish +0.25% on the day.

Theres a lot of big businesses that support Trump, at least more than the media likes people to believe. If he’s dropping a platform like this in such a serious manner, as he just did, then I think him and his team already have it figured out, honestly. Politics aside, he is an efficient organizer and competent and drawing support from various people and businesses

I’m being apolitical here, but Trump and his team was quite organized and efficient during his campaign and his presidency, whether people agree with his policies or not, he and his team are quite good at organization and logistics, so I don’t see this platform being mismanaged imo

Earlier this year, Reuters reported that the company was in talks with private equity firms for a potential sale.  
  
Commenting on the acquisition, Powell remarked "brrrrrrr"

In all seriousness, I searched YT for “live stock show” at 8:00a because Bloomberg wanted to talk about 0.1% gains and ignore mango + p hun type things

And only two channels came up. Had about 4-5k viewers each.

I realize this was a meme post, but there’s definitely room for a good live show hosted by regular people who don’t act like robot shills for the banks.

They are convertible to shares at 1:1 ratio but can only be converted 30 days after merger. If you believe that the shares will be worth more than the warrant price now 30 days after the merger then you profit.

So how low does the COIN dip go before it continues upwards? I'm holding so my guess is -50% or more, cos that's what always happens to the stocks I hold.

Thoughts on VIAC? Seems like it's getting oversold at this point on no news.  Is the attention on DWAC bringing down other media stocks?

Lol watch Robinhood not buy our Mango shares just like GME, than they have to buy in pushing this to 1k a share next week.

Robinhood goes bankrupt, we all get 250k insurance payouts

Maybe. I just don't know how far that gets you in terms of bottom line. I open up twitter and I see an Iphone ad; have to imagine that's significantly more lucrative, and I don't think they're necessarily a model for success, either.

I would tell you to do the same. Inflation is here, it's going to stay. Look at the cpi, ppi, and trade balances. All indications that we have a piss poor economy. Good day sir, I would encourage you to get into gold and crypto.

Well will you go ahead and buy it then?

Yeah because that’s obviously a market that’s not already saturated with options and closed off with licensing agreements

Fuck around and find out

Who bought that sweet DWAC dip at 70?

Not too get too political, but that white nationalist and hate content isn’t as common as most people think. I’m not talking about people who say “we support the police” I’m talking about actual white nationalism. The idea that  it’s so prevalent is incredibly misled and propagated by the side who doesn’t like Trump. 

Trump’s base wants a platform that lacks censorship so it is allowed to post something like “I don’t like when BLM riots burn down businesses” without being removed from Twitter. 

The advertisements will primarily come from military related support groups, businesses aimed at helping veterans, local businesses, ect

Depends on the interest rates. Debt obtained prior to inflation costs less (if wages adjust).

Out of 🥭 at 100. This will help cover my WISH losses

Just because the last few failed doesn’t follow that this one will.

You can't print all the money that the federal reserve just did and expect inflation to be transitory. You're living in a fantasy world if you think that's true. 2nd) the US can't afford to raise rates so inflation is only going to get worse. Sounds like you're the one who doesn't know what they're talking about.

If 10% of American social media users moved to mango you would have ungodly amounts of money.

Regardless of what you think. There are over 60 million people in this country who think Trump is smarter than Elon musk, a better leader than George Washington, and more business savvy than warren buffet. They still haven’t heard of DWAC. When they do they’re gonna start FOMO’ing hard

Watch the platform never actually be released, or get released and have it be so grade school shit that it’s clear no one ever even put in the time to try to make it a real product.

Homes up nearly 40%, gas up significantly, food up a lot as well. The sign is there that inflation is here to stay. You can think it's transitory all you want but you're wrong

Unpopular opinion (probably) : 

I don’t know if most of you can’t put two and two together, but once DWAC allows for options trading, and then when the platform actually releases, it’s going to go up more than it has these last two days. 

Not saying it’s necessarily a long term hold at this price, but for a short time when options are available/when the platform actually drops, it’s going to go up more. 

Plus a lot of Trumps base will use the platform so DWAC is going to maintain a solid price for that reason itself

if they fleece even just 10% of FB, Twitter and Youtube American users it will be a monster. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it.

Puts on da liver

probably buyin 455 calls right now

We ending today green so it don't even matter

I'm just gonna match whatever the Fed does from now until I die. If they're easing I'm buying, if they're tightening I'm selling. Because our nation literally couldn't survive going back to 5% interest rates at this point.

Mango/PHUN holds over the weekend going to be easy 3x/8x me thinks.

And no available trucks to ship them fast enough. Production isn't the problem. Logistics is. It's not limited to domestic shipping, either. JIT logistics is fucking up pricing everywhere.

I predict every company to have record profits and warn on guidance due to supply chain issues. So every stock will tumble at first and then everyone will realize everyone is affected by supply chain issues and then they'll look at these stocks as all in the same ocean again and the winners will go back up relative to everyone else.

Example:
Google made 8 gazillion dollars. Yay. Stock goes up. But fear supply chain issues. Booo. Stock goes down.

After everyone says the same thing, they'll realize that I gazillion dollars with supply chain issues is better than 8 dollars  and also with supply chain issues, and Google will go back up again.

So you can buy now, or buy after the guidance dip, but it's going to be a discount on what is a clear winner for many of these companies.

Record profits but on sale because they're affected by the same pandemic affecting the entire fucking planet? Oh no, what a terrible stock, they're making record profits in a pandemic. Idiots. 

Keep buying is my advice.

See ya everyone! Hope y’all made money too! Time for some fun.

SNAP *murdered* those 9:30-9:35 dip buyers. Good riddance to it, what a silly &amp; out of proportion run it had.

Fb may buy back their own stock.
The worst had been priced in.
Any beat will be mooning session.

Buy the dip boys.

I bought at 38 as a joke and sold for 117.  now im buying 0dte calls on everything thats red right now.

gonna be rich

The DWAC battle for 100 is intense. 80+million shares traded so far. Wild

That’s right, chase on my friend

Still drunk from last night and now I’m 3 beers deep. Calls on 🅱️ussy

Y'all know damn well this P&amp;D was an intentional scheme by mango to fleece retail, right?

I mean, congrats to the people who are selling for a profit, but some major bag alerts are about to come out.

Bruh 😂🤣🤣🤣

Spy puts or calls for next week? Need to turn this $500 into $5000

Yeah

TSLA gains making up for my poor financial decisions.

Is HOOD a good play going into earnings next week?

there's a turkey shortage for Thanksgiving. We have Farms ya know.

May my IBM calls go to the moon 🌚

Wait till we find out she had puts on SPY this entire time while harping about taxing the rich

That's a 60% increase. Inflation is here and it's bad.a

QQQ GREEN EOD

Seriously, im pretty mad about it but i bought the most recent dip at $5.79 so lets hope it works out

Thanks Papa

feels good man

considering this an another amazon FD

I’m yelling timber

Bought a jnug put at open when it was up over 4$. I has nervous for about an hour.

Wow google you got to be kidding me

Wish I had more money to buy the dips, anyone need a broker?

I just think the barrier to entry on Amazon options is so high that they take advantage of it to exploit max pain much more regularly on it than other mega cap stocks. 

Honestly I don't know for sure, of course. It is the only think that really makes sense for this stock to have traded sideways for the past few months. 

I get the run up has been insane on it, but at this point it was higher in August of 2020 and can't even hold that high for very long.  With AWS, expanding brick and mortar footpring,  and them transitioning into one of the top 2 or 3 shippers in the country/world, I just don't understand what explains the sideways action.

Maybe he should just tweet about it...oh wait...

Keep your cash for when this market crashes

Me and SPY are in a love hate relationship, all she ever does is blue ball me. Get's me so close to making real money this BOOM recovery or rejection. Bitch, just move 1% either direction

Yeah it was a joke, but I honestly haven’t seen posts about AOC like that, but you’re not wrong, there are definitely a lot of creepy people out there

I heard from my wife there is even Turkey shortages. There goes Thanksgiving. LETS GO BRANDON!

IS there still time to buy spy puts? Whats your prediction for EOD? I hate this this board is only about mango now

yeah. it's related to the greeks, but the general idea is that options will carry some "momentum" at smaller time scales. If SPY is falling a dollar a minute then the calls will depreciate more, once the decline stops, even  if it doesn't rise all the way, the calls will gain more money back because now the chance of reversal exists and the downward momentum is diminishing.

Woke news

Buy the dip now, easy money

He shot the sheriff?

I’m all cash as of now besides BABA shares (bought at 155) and DKNG leaps (which are down bad today). 

Any plays for close?

Corsair is a solid company, a good brand, and has a good growth story. They will eventually begin an uptrend, I wouldn't sell CC at their current level, either sell or hold.

With tapering starting next month that might not work out

I'm getting massacred today. Thank God I loaded on CLF calls last night but not enough to offset the bloodbath. SDC bagholding ain't easy.

I refuse to re buy into 🥭 unless it drops to 30

Idgaf take it all , everything else is priceless people, fo-fam, the view.

It's pretty much an in-game thread for the market. You don't get insights or previews here, only reactions. I suppose over time you can see patterns maybe, but not really.

Isnt it something when you buy a call while the stock is dropping and make money even though the stock is still lower than when you bought the call?

🦍

This would be that crash I was talking about

Paper handers gonna regret it.

7 years of investing and who knew, I could've made vastly better returns putting my money into $DWAC on 10/21/21 and pulling it out on 10/22/21

Maybe, maybe not, but there is millions who think just like that and the odds of one or two acting on it?  It's not your post in itself it's more I see SO many posts like this

&gt; I'm feeling good. I think SNAP is going to have a great quarter and the stock price will be up by next Friday morning.

Feel bad for Baldwin. He has to live his life with killing another person, which is hard enough when you're a cold blooded killer, but this wasn't even like a careless driving car crash, just a freak accident... 

Anyhow, calls on DIS I guess

Baba 200c for march? Feel like that will make some decent coin

They don’t know I bought DWAC at $165

Keep this one till end of 2022 and retire 🚀🚀🚀

bottom of?

You think they'll manipulate it less when it's more affordable? It's been manipulated by the elite manipulators which is probably better than being manipulated by the masses.

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/The_Annunzio (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 447.4206 when it was 451.94 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Last 5 minutes! Mango pump until 12:15!

Oh I’m sorry, I thought 🥭 was about to happen again

Take my upvote you funny bastard

Can’t wait to see all the DWAC loss porn this weekend

It’s a platform popular among young people. Perfect for targeted marketing. 

It’s just that, one, only 16% of people allowed SNAP to track data after Apple’s update. 

And two, stealing children’s data so you can put products in front of their face is absolutely just ASKING for the hammer to come down eventually.

I put in some play money that has turned into real money but amma let er ride. Fuckem

Fuck no. They just said they have supply issues and their data center business is declining while AMD is stealing market share.

BUY THE DIP

SHOP giving me those eyes rn. 10/29’s?

To new investors, now is not the time to be asking to get into dwac. Yesterday morning when it was $10-12 was. There is no product, this was and is purely a pump and dump. Most of us are out. I bought at 12 and sold before close yesterday. Bought again this morning at 88 and sold at 120. You see how the game is played? If there were options I would be buying a put.

Basically. Deadline is the 31st but they always pass it before the deadline

[removed]

it is the third time that I buy high and sell low mango

this is the bottom, buy calls now or be broke forever

The show goes on ‼️

Is your name Dylan?

It's a SPAC. Don't options only become available once it merges with its company?

Baldwin is lucky he only killed a women and didn’t tell a homophobic joke

What's up with all this David Tepper double talk? Sounds bearish.

Lmao I need it back at 120 to sell and break even. Should I sell now at 100 or will it touch 120 once more

But will she fuck you?  I think she prefers to screw her constituents

Snap over corrected and I dive in like a master tard

You're right man! Gotta not get greedy. Thank you!

I’d be rolling in that DWAC/PHUN money if it weren’t for me not obsessing over this thread anymore

As long as the price is this high hedge funds or whoever it is that is selling these calls and then working the price to sweep the chips off the table every week is scum.

I've learned my lesson. Hard.  There is just no reason for this stock to be trading sideways at this point other than retail can't do shit about it.

I just dumped at 7%. Lame ass stock. If the market ever pops it's a decent hold but who knows when that'll be

[removed]

And to fuck over there competition. There business model is based on selling hardware. The rest went the other way. And the moment they saw antitrust come in. They rug pulled them all.

"Hah, I knew it was a bad time to buy".

\-me during a slight dip after missing the entirely of a +10% run over the last week on a tickers that I routinely play calls on.

What makes you think this?

technically this is a "recession" the "inflation" is just a side effect

now if you a poker player you can calculate how much inflation you got in your hand and bid to to frighten the recession bidders from raising

but it starts with  the money bet on a recession hand, the guy picked up his cards and that's what he seeed. Now he lookin you in the eye and he calculating his next bid.

Halloween 🎃 coming early! May the blood of your calls nourish my VIX monster

Its given up the 57 price floor. This stock has a long way to fall before it reestablished a base. I'd play a 90 day 57 call, maybe

I just loaded up on 452 wednesday calls. Will be printing shortly

Done, enjoy

I love dump and pumps

Google search can't be defeated just like YouTube. Even if you have unlimited money.

On days like today, I need the weekend thread to forget about trading for a bit.

And it's pretty low float.  Cap in absolute terms is not that big.  Speculative?  Yes.  Huge upside long term?  Yes.  Could be a 100 bagger if executed right.

Did they already ask J Pow how he was going to singlehandedly solve wealth inequality? Love when they ask him that. The looks he gives are priceless.

[deleted]

I was thinking the same... huge upside potential but it's too soon unless you wanna spend 500 on monthlies

If spy goes below 451 in the next 15 minutes, I’m gonna buy calls for November 9th or so, I’m sticking with fucking off until monday.

I'd be rolling in that DWAC/PHUN money if it weren't for my stupid job taking up all my precious time.

Yeah ok 😂😂😂

You alright man?

The old switcheroo very cool

Right?

It was being pumped on AM radio last night and Fox this morning. They know.

Nay PYPL

Or its just that data mining is has become so common that snap has no leg over any of the 10000 other means of gathering data. 


What value do they provide when there are 20 other companies that can pull the exact same data faster and more efficiently

Spy can only slow down SoFi for a little bit. She’s just too damn strong 😍

&gt; I have vix calls and spy apple and qqq puts moron

lmao, are you me?

The only saving grace is that most of my plays are earnings plays that have yet to play out - but will have to rally hardcore to reverse the ass ramming they’ve been getting

Powell: Inflation is transitory and will work itself out. We will consider not pumping hundreds of billions into the economy every month at a much later date when the economy is doing great.

New Rule: Fed can't trade individual stocks

Powell: Inflation is a systemic risk. We now need to seriously consider tapering now. Its the responsible thing to do.

Sq is always a good buy when its down, no cap

I’ve been buying spy calls mid day when it’s red like right now. Spy and qqq are tech heavy though. I’d wait for the 10 year to cool off or buy the dip with stocks

Stock is pretty volatile and could run up in the next year or could even continue to fall. 

It's a real company and will likely get there eventually either way

Edit- at the time you posted that SPY was trading at $332, $30 over what you considered overvalued. You were not right considering a month later it crashed.

Please admit you bought in over $300 as well and you are a retard.

Ya true, def overly emotional there.  Trying to learn how to keep a better handle on things.

My 401k is up 4 dollars today.

I remember they were the talk of the town here for being such a stupid idea for a company and being way overvalued. I still can't believe the sociopath who was in charge was renting out buildings he personally owned to his own company.

Agree. Tbh, new 🥭 media venture (social media, TV, events, etc.) is only valued at a few billion. For perspective NFLX is valued at around $300B. The YouTube and YouTubeTVsegment of GOOG is likely worth over $500B by itself. Current value is roughly 50x lower than NFLX. Is it speculative? Fuck yea. Does it have legitimate upside potential from current price? Yea. It also has a spokesperson who, for better or worse, absolutely know how to attract attention. And it has the most meme potential of anything I've seen in a long time. All aboard the mango train! 🤠 🥭 🚆

I absolutely cannot wait to get off to some incredible loss porn next week

We moved from dwac. PYPL 🚀

Do you feel SPY and TQQQ are safe?

tbh this is probably the worst place anywhere to be asking for stock tips...

Ugh donnie crashing the stock market from the grave

and mods not banning the mango pumpers.

Just waiting for investors to realize that this era of data-mining will be seen in the future as a “wild west” era where you could just steal people’s data with no repercussions. 

Just Apple changing its policy made SNAP go down 22% — so, so many of these names are heavily reliant on stealing your data for targeted marketing. 

I think Apple changed its policy because the writing is on the wall: collecting data without asking was a pretty obvious privacy violation with heavy regulatory risk.

It’ll be interesting, just my two cents.

No

Blood in stool needs to be checked out, could be serious bruh

Lmaoooo someone has to hold the bags my dude, otherwise this shit wouldn’t be profitable for half. Thanks for your sacrifice

Trump is an absolute boss. You don't have to like him bc most people hate their bosses. Nevertheless this company is going to fuck up digital media so good!

Yikes. Round numbers are dangerous. I took my Roth IRA from $28k to $48k in two months and then got greedy trying to hit 50 and rode it back down to $32k in a day with the big tech dump.

Brexit memes are back again I guess

Trump and mango\* team thinks this company is worth $880 million. Random redditors on internet thinks this company is worth 88 billion dollars ($1000 price target) lmaooooooooo with 0 product. 88 billion dollars is worth 40 times more than trumps real networth and can make a random spac go up 20 times its NAV loooooooooooool.

Here's the plan. Noon on the east coast. From now till 12:15 run Mango to the moon and sell everything at 12:16. 
Here. We. Go.

Up 50% on 10/29 $OPEN puts, still holding for now

When? I want a link lol and that would have made me right for the timeframe...

Could go either way.. but I’m surprised it’s been holding 85 for awhile

Dare I say it, is WISH a buy here?

I dont understand. The markets are regulated. This is what regulation looks like. 🤡

Sometimes i just wish that i have that kind of elon musk money to throw in thousands of thousands to 0dte SPY puts and calls and just watch it goes up and down without worrying about anything

Buy the SPY dip?

An idiot for sure. Probably losing money on $IBM

What’s the move for AAPL before earnings

SPAC

Trump have picked up right industry now…look at FB with 900B+ market cap. Twitter 50B+ market cap.


No need to deal with real estate, his next goal should be to be richest person on the planet with all the knowledge he has gained in last 4 years 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Should combine forces with another 100% loss trader and then you can inverse each other and keep the market in a perpetual sideways motion forever.

TSLA and SPY briefly break ATHs 

Bears : “HA did you buy at the top idiot? Only going down from here! My puts will print, did you actually think we WEREN’T going to crash? Anyways, 10/29 300p SPY”

Better figure It out. We going to 400

Awesome. I got out earlier. Had 500 contracts for 452.50. Made good money could’ve been much more way she goes. Too scary for me

🍊 needs to do a press release

I have a 100% track record of losing money. Anyone want to make bets opposite of me and split the profits?

For some reason, I believe you

I miss yesterday morning.

One more reason I don't mess with SPY right now.

Smh.

I understand that most people on this sub has autism so I'll make it clear that this is a joke.

Good move …

Trump money

who loves orange soda?

Just go to $26, CLF!  Or $25, shit…. Even $24 again.

Anyone knows when Dwac options will be enabled

Yea but I just bought SPY puts so that means we rally to ATH

Why did 🥭 crash? Did Biden announce his own social media platform? trump cucked by sleepy joe again

 The Truth always prevails

Apple gonna make an entrance. Eat it all by themselves. If I was FB and snap I would be scared shitless. Tim Apple even called FB business model “rotten”. 

Google has bigger moats. But not enough to leave unscathed.

DUMP IT! LOUDERRR! DUUUMMMPPP IIITTTT

J bro said the T word

&gt; I'm not sure what you're talking about.

We've been in a 2-month dip, and you're surprised everyone is taking profit the second SPY hits a new ATH? I mean, I'm pretty stupid, but even I knew to buy puts as soon as it broke 454.10.

[removed]

I’m in so much profit that even if I get Margin called I profit 😂😂 lmao

Lol imagine losing money for a political stance. Took my profits and ran this morning.

I’m not trying to brag but I bought the dip at $160

Yes I know this but the top ten usually make a difference and nine of them are dropping steadily

&gt; Man, fuck this. I'm going to go get a drink

Apple is gonna do with ads as they did music and gaming. Create a gated privacy community and make bank on servicing “private ads”. Dump Google as default search. Overwrite 3rd party ads. Companies gonna drop ship from FB, snap, GOOG. They gonna drink it all.

Then they will lower the fee on App Store instead. Ads are way more profitable.

ok. so where did you even say that in your original comment you absolute twat?

Punk goes pop

Yeah I can't wait for the real ticker to go live and he gets reverse splits until they are worth more than BERK-A. Anyone with half a brain knows he'll do that.

He probably knows the real money is make it go meme-stock and dilute at the top but his ego will want the actual highest stock price.

Seems pretty obvious that 🥭 made his new social media platform for one reason:

STONK SKYROCKET.

I paper handed spy puts a bunch of times this morning and lost a lot of money. Each time I bought 200 spy puts exp monday. Then I rebought at a higher price and only bought 100 puts. Had I held through the dips, I would have made about 30k. FML

Lol, i must’ve mist it then, only heard about it this morning on WSB. But then again i live in Europe so maybe that’s why it wasn’t on the news

Laughing at the emotions here. You guys do realize that he has a huge backing of which mostly don’t know about the stock yet? This could be yuge once promoted, never put your emotions in your wallet. Big picture 🥭

Spoiler alert: these last two months were a huge double top for spy

Big tek gaping my bloody arsehole

The "MU dip" has been going on for about six months now...

Best call of the week right here!

It is literally what he always does.  He is going to be dropping bags on everyone stuck in this thing.

The advertising market will eventually adjust, companies aren't just gonna stop spending on iOS adds. The social media pull back is prime buy low.

Coming from the guy who posted a year ago "stonks only go up!"...

Lmao if anybody bought BABA 0 DTEs puts at the top today must be so happy right now

I’d rather see it swing from 100 to 400 to 30 to back to 80 than to have these circuit breakers interrupting it 20 times during the day

Bet, I just got back from the grocery store, my food bill is up again. My berries rose from 11.98 to 17 99 over night

How does that make her retarded? Mind you, I believe she said this back when a share was around the 700s. It’s not in the late 800-early 900s. So how does that make her retarded?

When do we get options

Some of y'all are acting like the sky is falling from a Friday sell off after a week long rally. Nothing that J Pow said was new information. Markets may go down or remain flat for a while but there is still plenty of bets to be had and money to be made or lost

BONK

In 2 months there are going to be desperate bagholders spamming DWAC endlessly and I’m tired of it before it even starts.

Spy done drilling?  Switch to 0 dte calls or call it a day?

Seems orchestrated? It was up 15x dude. It’s just correcting as people take profits + panic sell. It’ll probably rally again.

Yall know AMZN and SPY both going green by EOD

I’m a sucker for metal covers of pop songs

WTF is happening? Is Trump's next bankruptcy just sucking all the money out of market?

That'd be great. Will buy more at a cheaper price woot woot

Can’t wait for options on the mango stock. That shit is going to be hilarious.

I feel that 

I just snorted my adderall

Thinking about how we used to be “not even thinking about thinking about tapering or raising interest rates”

The return of the short yellow bus attacks

Mango is live

This is moving too fast, I think we should see other people.

Is this the recession?📉📉📉

Just reading your comment, can’t Reddit do it already?

In dollar amount, how much you down today? I'm only down $2K (out of $80K) so not too bad

[deleted]

Nah, for weeks and weeks a lot of them have been calling for tapering starting November. But yeah they absolutely sold the tippy top and then decided to all of a sudden become ethical people just before they dunk on us.

I'm glad you've got it all figured out.

Im pumping and dumping Mango. But look there is still hope. Buy it and dont sell. Dont let the libs win.

We all know one video from Donnie about it and it goes up 100% in less than 3 minutes

I’m specifically talking about QCOM, but really any profitable tech.

i mean that's two stocks so not really what vix is tracking?

At least GME hit 169.69

100ma rejection on the SPY 15m keeps happening. Not sure the vix is convinced.

So what exactly is holding spy up all the underlying are drilling

I got out at $907 I'll jump back in at sub $800'

Yeah but they have been saying this shit. It's all a game.

I really wish Powell would shut the fuck up. He says the same thing every meeting and the market drops

I like this setup.

Apple gonna launch their own add platform at scale.

die NET you fucking 🐷

thank god I went for a weekly strangle and not just calls lol although I did 50 puts to 150 calls. Back to even on the day though, crazy

Sell, SPY is still on the uptrend and infrastructure deal might come this weekend which would leave you mega-fucked.

Wow. Too soon?

Removed because I'm extra retarded before caffeine.

Where's the bottom though? 230? Here? I actually thought we would bounce today with the news the deal is probably dead.

if u didn’t see SNAP getting destroyed then u should prolly stop trading.

So the pullback was a day or two later than anticipated and now everyone thinks it’s the end? Jesus Christ people spy was at 451 two days ago

You can buy more.

it's not going to get bad

I read an article saying we are a week away from one of the most predictable bull periods of the year. 

End of October and beginning of November average run up of 3% in a week. I have dry powder and will move appropriately.

"GET YOUR HALF OFF SPY CALLS OVER HERE! RIGHT OVER HERE, PLENTY FOR EVERYBODY!"

We dropped for 2 months straight, SPY hasn’t even broke its last ATH (barely) 

Your puts will be worthless by Monday

Congrats on the profit today tho!

Only 28 mil shares of Mango available and 600 mil volumes 2 days. 

Hodl bois! We own the boat!

New investors came out of the woodwork to buy gme. I'm 100% speculating they will figure it out.  I know it could go back to $10, but I think trumpers will buy and hold. The irrationality of Trump supporters is my entire hypothesis on this one.

Take this as a learning opportunity and don't ever FOMO into something that's already rocketed.

Not sarcasm. What are we even doing here? If the market is supposed to function under a certain set of rules and Underlying characteristics actually affect the stock price other than Jerome Powell and the word interest rates. Then GME is as solid as gold.

Otherwise the market is just a casino where interest rates determine gains. Which is what most of you retards are betting on

The greatest pump and dump this week 😇

I’m saved ! VIX is back ! The top is in - sell everything you have and buy tinned fish !

We dropped for 2 months, don’t start losing your money on puts that only print sadness

FOMC typically results in a violent swing one way as a fakeout before revealing the real move (I know today isn’t FOMC, but Powell’s update was FOMC-like).

Don’t get greedy with your puts.

Friendship with Papa Powell has ended 🥲 happy for the gains i made along the way

Bulls congrats on your fake and 🌈 market the last year and a half. Time to take your gains, admit you're retarded for investing in anything above SPY 300 and thank your lucky stars the market was as irrational as you were. Tapering is here and the fun is over. Easy mode go bye bye. The time of the bear is atlast upon us! Get out or get burned bull clowns

Lmao my DWAC stop loss at 70 hit just to go up right after lmao. Oh well still got some and made money

It's the easiest and most legal way for Putin to support Trump.

Have all the oligarchs dump piles of money into a 'social network'.

Not enough volume. Load up on your daily spy puts

TSLA get your fat ass above 900 again

if u don’t buy the spy dip u hate money

I should sell my puts now but I want to see below 451, that will be my downfall

I'm a sucker for dips. Wish I had more free money 😿

Lol. Imagine thinking they are right to pull out. 

Let me ask you a question. When people protested Chick-fil-A what happened to their business? Did it: 

- A) triple overnight 
- B) stay the same

Enjoy your $31. You deserve it!

I wanna buy this spy dip, but I also don’t like holding over the weekend. I’m just gonna fuck off till Monday.

I told you not to go to spy today, but you didn’t listen.

This drop in tech is brutal

This literally isn't even a stock. You bought a stake in Trump's imagination.

Remember this?

That's pretty far OTM

Account is down 3% today but stocks were fun again this morning so I’ll take it!

Too much growth tech in the portfolio??

Me too man. Me too

My LCID 11/5 put just gained 100%. From .01 to .02

It's pretty much how I get thru life, so yeah.

That cardboard box outside of Trump Tower is looking probable. Even if you didn’t by 🥭😬

Just saw a pre-built on costcos website with a 3080 TI for 3.5k. It was an MSI build too

Clf was and is a no-brainer and calls are cheap

I’m stupid when it comes to all of that stuff. But it can run gta 5 on high settings.

Can we just say who tf cares and get to $460🥲

Ah yes therefore…..processing logic…..GME won’t see a 30,000% gain. Got it.

Same now the question is how low do we go

Holy fukin Hell! 

No risk it, no biscuit.

His breakeven is 450 no? He bought the 454p at $4 each.

I get the impression though that them MAGA people wouldn’t have the capacity to ACTUALLY go out and purchase the stock. They will just talk about it? Where as the ones (like this community) who follow the market have been and rinsed the ride for what it’s worth

If you aren't prepping to fomo into DWAC options, you ain't black.

We have a little drop and the bears are already getting ready to whip out their TA and inflation 101 books to start posting about “why this market is going to crash”

I was quoting myself from earlier. You said “no 800% there” I quote myself from the beginning. Where I never said I had 800% gains

Holy fuck you’re stupid

Yeah, I hate Trump, but I'm just imagining the conviction of apes talking about sticking it to wallstreet, and applying that to all the Trumpers out there. I think this will be a combination of supporting Trump and "sticking it to main stream media", and "I'll never sell because Trump is going to save the world".

Don't forget to buy the dip

My one black friend bought in this morning and is down 50% some of y’all still trying to say mango man not racist

Advertisement revenue is in danger bummm

another fund, Lighthouse Investments, divested from DWAC today after finding out about Trump's involvement.  Obviously they booked a nice gain, but this is the third investment group to pull out.  Mango is toxic to investors.   Yes, Trump's followers are brainless and will pour into this thing, but unless you hate money you have to read the writing on the wall.

The lying fake news trading commission halted one of, if not the, best stock on the market, many people are saying this, great people, yuge people, they’re saying it’s rigged, they’re saying the Chinese have rigged this system to ruin this great nation, just as they have rigged their global warmth hoax as an economic attack on our beautiful, strong way of life, working hand in hand with the devious Russians. The leader of the Russians is named Putin, so I’m told. He’s got “put” in his name, folks, you can’t make this up.

Mother fukers just keep halting it

Ive heard they say to keep liquidity in the market 

But I think its just to scare the fuk out of everyone

It is. Never hold your money overnight. I’ve gotten fucked way too many times from banks downgrading stocks in AH/PM, or some news coming out then I have to watch my calls burn ‘til I’m able to sell them at open for a -80% loss. Day trading is definitely the way. 

You stop losses doesn’t matter if it’s not during trading hours.

Make more money

The deleveraging because of intense volatility. It happens when some stocks go off the charts, it creates risk for the broader market and leverage gets pulled by hedgies and market makers. Happent with gme, amc, and when tesla was making the big move last year in August.

If they held through the whistleblower, they're too stupid to sell into the collapse of Internet ad futures.

Delusional.

You're not even a good bear - might as well to switch to bull or cash gang.

I think they are going to lose all their money when the company inevitably goes bankrupt as trump projects have a tendency to do.  But hey grats to all the folks who aren't to stupid to take profit while it's there.

Jay: Bitch did you really just ask that question?

right at the end of a long market pump, you have absurdly gains of high risk stocks because people are getting less and less risk averse and chasing riskier plays… the gains are the most extreme right before the collapse, its like this everytime.

Yeah thought you could make money from a scammer who lost money on casinos? Lol

All businesses are failed but yeah... Dwac.

Happened to me to, made me lose over $500 bucks in a second

I expect a run like SPCE where it bounces all over the place and no one knows what the fuck will happen next

So every adult american paying 50 dollars to listen to Mango and people plotting terrorist attacks? Sounds reasonable.

This pile of dog shit is Nikola 2.0, billions of dollars in market cap without a product

I made a 350% killing on DWAC, and I am so tempted to jump in and out again.  someone with money tell me what to do

AMD pump was a trap. Thousands of fund managers sitting on sell limit orders @120 ready to kill any catalyst, or something.

That’s fair, but it’s not like I’m losing all my money even if it doesn’t go up. I threw my portfolio into it but I still have money in the bank so I’m good either way  😇

I’m dumb but I’m not stupid

This is my lesson in placing limit buys. My order filled at $175, what do I win?

Seeing red again seeing red again seeing red again

I don't understand this stuff. Like some of y'all bought the DWAC stuff yesterday. How do you know this stuff? Maybe I should stop reading the Hunt Showdown and Valheim subreddits only.

#tump just commented on the DWAC situation:


Halts are the greatest threat in the US to both bald and golden eagles. Media claims fictional ‘global warming’ is worse. They would never halt Hillary. SAD!

Thats why I bought them yesterday.  Turns out I didn't need leverage on that one.

But they don't have any earnings

It’s funny to read the people blaming the trump and dump for the entire market going down……as the federal reserve says they are going to taper and inflation is higher than expected

Nah Biden will pull some shit out of his ass

tapering is still on

🥭 had me up over 200% at one point but ended my run with it making a measly 10%. Lesson learned I guess. But hey. 1k is 1k. That’s what I get for thinking this shit was going to make me a millionaire.

apparently SPY did not beat the earning. They miss the revenue.

Go to Bestbuy and get a OMEN laptop. It’s got specs for a gaming laptop and it runs everything super smooth. I enjoy it, only cost like 980, maybe like 1.2k if you get a bigger screen and other shit.

Just saying, there are dips on the way up. I'd be more worried about averaging down than panic selling right now. This has at least a week's worth of climbing left.

Hey @jpow fuck you

And now, of course, you deflect.

I don't care about what you "feel" we need to prioritize. The point was that you have a false idea of what Mango man did and I corrected it. Okay? It's cleared up. Accept that you were wrong about him and move on. It's real simple. My job is done. Have a nice day. Hope you recover your losses. Snapchat was a big hit.

Well, that was basically my whole post. I mean, the shot does work, I have taken it long ago and every that can should get vaccinated. The thing is, just like the influenza, COVID is probably going to become a seasonal virus that wreaks havoc every winter with some years worse than others. 

Sure, we'll have to live with it, I'm no fear monger despite what it may sound, I just have the impression that markets would loose their shit if we saw another wave right now.

Welp, so far my gamble is not working out. But mango is my favourite fruit. Ride or die. Let's go!

Huge selloff in spy was so people could buy mango. 

They forced it to crash with all the halting and we're about to see it explode

Imagine believing wall street con artists who pay off financial advisors to tell you that "holding for the long haul" is a smart investment decision.

The best part is that all the political morons here are the ones that will be bag holding this shit.

Powell says he’s done with the printer

They need a commoner on the Fed board to call the others out on their shit and tell off the politicians for their policies.  JPow can't tell the truth because he's too worried about his next term or tanking his 5 million dollar portfolio.

[removed]

I warned about Mango, expect him next to "raise capital" by dumping shares on you, he has a habit of fucking his supporters when he doesn't need them anymore, I mean, like just after the Jan 6 insurrection.

JFC, you should try to buy stocks that go up

No it’s because they made the single comment of “apple new IOS doesn’t allow ad companies to track their ad campaigns”. So Ad companies can’t target adds to you and know how well they are working. So it scared other companies that base their revenue off of add sales.

So it’s expected that other companies that are based on this will have bad earnings as well. Fuck snap chat. No one uses it. It’s gay. Facebook is actually used, if not should be a classified addiction.

And made a lot of us a lot of money.

Not me, sold at 23.95. 

Got the pun tho

Jay fix your fuckin audio. Click ‘switch audio’ and connect your phone.

Very red day. Tesla might actually moon on Monday tho

Remember how an inflationary environment makes it so that companies have a harder time hitting targets due to increased costs and lower margins?

Remember how margin trading is near all time highs as people gamble on earnings calls that don’t hit their expectations.

Remember how the economy shut down early 2020 and has really recovered since but stonks are at all time highs?

Enjoy OpEx today you degenerates.

I’m down too. It’s all good. Can take my money but not my spirit. I do wonder if it will come back though. It’s got that oversold thing going on rn.

SPAC DA only rips temporarily. Get ready to see it much closer to NAV. Next rip will be coming up to merger. The question is, will it bleed slowly like LCID, will it go back to NAV, like most do, or will it actually fall below NAV like 23 and me?

Jesus christ stop dumping holy shit QQQ I'm dead

God damn 🥭. Putting all my gains into AMC now lol

Anyone that bought mango after open and held is down at least 30%… loss porn pleas!

It's because it was picked too early and the fruit doesn't have enough oil content. Try putting it in a paper bag for a day.

Define pump and dump...

Thank god I resisted the fomo. Still shaking though. Support looks to be close to 12 bucks

Well, would you consider last year a full meltdown? A lot of people lost money, but some bought at the bottom and made real gains within a few months. 

Anyway, I do hope I'm wrong and I was painting the worst case scenario, but unlike most here, I'm actually in the ER seeing patients, so I am concerned.

Bruh PayPal didn't deserve to lose 30b in market value just because they wanted to buy out another company like what the genuine fuck

Can't have a normal week without a complete and total collapse of tech

Who is shitting on the markets now?! Jpow?

I’ve heard if you put them next to bananas they would ripen faster

It was a play, it paid, cash in and move on

Yeah, I feel it.  I heard about this yesterday and took too long to commit otherwise I could've been up 10x+. I'm definitely rethinking how I can use my meme stock/pure gamble portion of my portfolio better.

70% is a great week!

Yesterday's snap earnings exposed big tech and the QQQ as being a shitty business model

If it's any consolation, I thought I knew how to take DWAC profits at 20 yesterday and then again at 50.

My goog fds down 93% smh

Morals in making money ....

Google is feeling the effects of this too; however, they’ll fare better than snap and maybe even Facebook since they collect so much first party data. Not to mention a lot of google ads are intent based rather than ‘avatar’ based. Aka they serve ads based on what you search rather than guessing what you’re interested in based on your online footprint.

Being wrong on my 🥭 decision is okay. I played with what I could afford, I saw it break support, I sold for a small loss, I can move on… as long as it tanks now otherwise I’m going to be jumping up and down like a monkey until I buy the top again.

If 🥭 closes below $50.18 then I declare myself a bona fide genius.

Really ugly chart haha, you are right.


They have just started generating revenue, with insane growth projected for FY 2022 which began in july. They just had a great earnings call. I would strongly suggest checking out that most recent call.


Fair value is between 14 and 22 and its currently sitting around 6. Positive news weekly. Just today they announced a new partnership that will bring in 6 figured in revenue which adds to the 105m in guidance. Profitability is around the corner. Their 2020 and 2021 acquisitions set them as the premier player in esports gambling and they will be the first in the country very soon - in NJ.


They do a LOT and they do it all very well through their acquisitions and synergies.

A lot of y'all are starting your gloating way too early. It's only been open for less than two hours, with only about 30 minutes of that being actually open to trade between halts.

Well that was an exciting morning!

currently down 10% on the snap calls i bought today

I bet it was Cathie who picked up 🥭 at $175

Panic-sold my 10 TSLA calls like a bitch for -180.... but I made like $4 on one 1 spy call. I call it a win!

Affirm is rising wtf

I put 10% of my inheritance from grandparents into 🥭 at $190 and now I’m down 50%.. I’m so upset should I sell

Hell yes!  It'll last forever.  I bought my 1080ti 
(Gigabyte) years ago and it is still going strong.  I'll probably buy the 3080ti early next year.

Dont worry guys itll go straight up forever

Ive bled so fucking much on BODY it might be time to actually tap out

A lot of y'all are starting your gloating way too early. It's only been open for less than two hours, with only about 30 minutes of that being actually open to trade between halts. 


I love kicking bagholders too, but laughing when it "tanks" to ***only twice what it closed at yesterday*** is pretty daft.

We gotta bust through 455 or else I gotta go to the local park and start eating bark.

That drop was definelty an over reaction. Im sure with there massive size they have things set in order to save them selves.

Or amc when it hit 30 Friday and I held over the weekend to watch it PUMP the week after. Word spreads so fast DWAC will be up next week when news this weekend spreads how much money people made.

Not up 800% but am up $146,000. Is that good enough?

Earnings reports are due from a lot of bigger ad-dependent companies pretty soon. If SNAP brought goog FB twtr down with its bad news, the same will happen the other way when they show slower growth or missed marks.

Any thoughts on deep ITM Snap calls?  I am thinking of Jan 2023 $40

I think I am going to just give in and buy a 3080 TI even if I get cucked on the price. Been waiting too long and sounds like it will be at least another year.

 $CLF - could it hit $30 by year end? ~50% upside

Some of the analysts think so. $CLF

FB you can stop playing around now and go back to 330

$CLF CEO is absolutely roasting analysts in this earnings call. this is hilarious

it is good time to buy intel at $50 , then u sell it before next earning.

Pro tip: If you want to short DWAC and unable to locate shares you can short the warrants DWACW. Also doesn't get halted when DWAC gets halted so can get an entry.

If..

If you block selling..

If you block selling how then are people buying?

Lmao. You are a legend.

No shit lol

Everyone saying DWAC is finished when is up 103% on the day.

Because the broker serves as a matchmaker between you and someone with a buy order. If I had a moonshot buy order for a $100 stock set at $50, whether by accident or leftover or being hopeful, and your SL executes a market sell at $100, broker matchmaking might work out in my favor and I get your shares mad cheap because your supply meets my demand. That's why it might be better to use stop limit orders in the future, although those have downsides as well.

I'm so happy your hatred prevented you from making lots of money the last couple days :D

It was so obvious when the halts started, just wait until 2-3 hours after market open to buy when its crushed down

You know what? I'm glad to have bought $17.67 and sold $50.81. I still don't know what you people were doing all day yesterday.

Honestly if DWAC would stop getting halted every fucking 10 minutes it would actually go up again. But jeez surprised it hit 157 in 1 day

Now they just randomly halting it

there cant be THAT many halts on DWAC right?  Like every fucking 10 minutes there's another one. How is it calculated?

The halts didnt cause mango stock to drop. Whales came in, pumped it and handed you the bags. The big boys saw an opportunity, struck, and moved on to something else, because that's what they do and that's why we're poor.

But, back to our topic - which part of - "you can change the orders which get triggered once order matching engine is unhalted" you didn't get?

or

"There is a reason why companies open at much lower (or higher for that matter, but at a margin) price after halting period?"

People change their unmatched-orders during halts, it's what halts are for.

I’m finally out at $110. Got in at $16 for 30 shares. 

If it shoots to $200, so be it. It’s been fun!

Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). Up 156% over the past 5 years, 81% for the past one year. Almost 5% in the past week. Not sure what is going on. I am long in it and am appreciative of the gains. Just wanted to share.

Neither was goog

Just think about the amount of $$ i lost to 0dte spy hurts me lol that $$ could go into play like affirm or net last 2 weeks anyway market always open for the opportunities so yeah good luk to both of us

I can't sell i don't want to get flagged as a pattern day trader.

No. We don't joke about that here.

I don’t think people get that, even if inflation is “transitory,” higher prices are not. Sure the inflation rate will eventually get back down to 2%, but the price increases and devaluation of the dollar has already happened. It’s not like we’re going to do a USD FORK and burn supply, this isn’t exactly a well run project. We just keep adding supply, infinitely.

Nope. I refuse

What 0DTE to drop my 🥭 gains to?

Seems like a good dip, but I like fb better.

Ok fellows apes. I haven't been much active in here ever since GME, but today I decided to comment because I believe there's something truly important about to go on. Please let me know if you think I should make this a post. 

I'm a health care worker in Portugal, the world's most vaccinated country, with more than 90% fully vaccinated. Despite this incredible vaccination rate, with many older people already getting their booster shots, we're actually seeing an increasing in the number of daily COVID cases for the last days. This is due to a number of factors, specially a new Delta variant mutation and the end of summer. 

This trend is also going on in many countries around the world right now. The UK is having a major comeback of daily cases and Puttin had to give one week off to Russian workers to try and stop a similar new wave. I wholeheartedly hope I'm wrong here, but if things keep going in this direction,  within the next 30 days Europe will be going into a winter with chaos at hospitals, out of control inflation and now natural gas to heat homes. 

Giving the many other uncertainties going on around markets right now, I believe a new wave of infections would have devastating effects on the markets. While this can lead to losses, it also means there would be opportunities for buying massive dips. 

This is not financial advice. I'm in no way as experienced as many in here, but this community has been great to me and I feel like many here aren't aware of this rapidly growing risk.

Shake up that UVXY  Mr.🥭

They are rotating into DWAC. They want to lose 50% instead.

house money all day &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

It's literally the same morons. You can watch them selling off GME to lose money on this shit.

I’m a marketing manager who oversees media buying and it’s literally almost impossible to run ads right on FB or SNAP after the iOS updates. Not surprised to see they’re struggling. Tread carefully with tech who rely heavily on ad revenue.

I got in at 190

Does anyone actually know what would happen if they didn’t hault stocks, like would it just go till there were no more shares to buy and everyone sold?

alright out of DWAC. that was fun

Bruh

Shhh, don’t draw attention

I loss a lot betting 0dte last month so seem like i dont get any luck with SPY. Last month when i bought call next day spy red, when i bought put spy went green, or stay flat all my options expired worthless. And this week spy went from 432 to 453 i was too scared to buy cuz of bad experience anyway hope for better month

&gt; I don't think they will.

Its not all about you hun

I remember when everyone laughed at people who bought GME at 150.  I was one of those people.  I sold it at 130 for a loss feeling like I made it out ok.  Weeks later, it was back over 200.  Not making that mistake again with orange man

In at $175 pray for me

This was announced yesterday. Most of the MAGA world doesn't know about it yet. I think by the end of this weekend they'll all know about the Trump stock. Big after hours, big Monday. I'm not looking to hold too long though...

I can’t believe I put my life savings into that.. My risk tolerance is scaring me.

This halt is criminal

So are they going to blame orange man for threatening the economy like they did GameStop?

Ah yes, corruption... the cornerstone of any fair and efficient market.

Oof. 

You can cancel your order to buy during a halt.

You can create new order to sell for a lower price during a halt (or change your current order). You can also add stop losses. 

There is a reason why companies open at much lower price with significant margin after halting period.

Oh, my god.

I knew it. Dude, go research why Trump did the bans. He did the bans because we were literally under terrorist attacks from Muslim countries and Islamist groups like ISIS, and he shut down travel between our countries to reduce exposure to the groups. How is that unreasonable and personally affecting you to a point of taking it so personally to a point of insult to your family -- who I am sure were not the terrorists we were defending ourselves against?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive\_Order\_13769#:\~:text=Trump's%20stated%20reason%20for%20issuing,pose%20no%20increased%20terror%20risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13769#:~:text=Trump's%20stated%20reason%20for%20issuing,pose%20no%20increased%20terror%20risk).

Jesus christ. Like I said, you're looking for stuff to be mad about. You don't want to know the truth. You just want to have someone to hate ironically for no reason.

He was protecting the country. Any rational person would shut the doors to their house to certain people from another house if they saw people from that house going into it, killing people, and breaking everything. He didn't say all Muslims were bad. But, if terrorists are coming from Muslim countries? Yeah, stop them from coming for a while until you figure it out. My god.

Quick last chance to grab some bags above 100 before we retrace to 40 on Monday

$DWAC is like every Trump business…huge hype and fanfare at the beginning followed by a bankruptcy, crash, closure and lawsuits.  Congrats to those who got in early and got out with their money.  Sympathies to those who bought over $100 will be losing their shirts.

Lmao. Is the rug pull happening so soon?

Dwac looking like the casinos that orange man runs

I heard one of the mango forums had boomers asking if settlement period was big government trying to limit them from buying mango stock. Lmfao, these are the people you're betting your money on.

This is better than any TV show. I love watching meme stocks pop. There are gonna be some folks with new cars and others who overnight became "investors" in a shitty spac.

You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders, the most famous of which is “Never get involved in a land war in Asia,” but only slightly less well known is this: “Never trust a mango when money is on the line!”

Quick question :
What broker did u use to buy DWAC?

Can we get back to BAU soon. I’m drowning in the self pitty of having no one fill my order and consequently being forced to pay for my new house with real money.

Told you guys yesterday to get COST 10/22 480s when they were .8 was an easy 4x.  10/29 500 are only .55 right now they will easily be a 5x next week

it did, but they shut it down because everyone took names like DonaldTrump and MikePence and started posting pig poop balls and well… the rest is history

r/conspiracy is already a thing

Yeah, that will work

Robert Durst was sent to life in prison - looks like he'll be there until EOY then

Supposedly if a stock moves more then 30 % the stock exchange halts the trading. However the length of the halt makes a huge difference and I'm not sure there are any regulations on that?

Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people.

I am not a day trader, however, i also am not a robinhood guy. I have a real brokerage account with real accounts and retirement accounts and my own "TOD" account where i fuck around myself with. Anyone who didn't have a stop loss set is a moron. I can't believe i didn't set one up when i woke up, i was still groggy. I got out at 105. Probably $25 a share too late., but i still made $2500 buying 40 shares.   my whole point? Set stop losses at where you're comfortable to get out at and be happy with it. I will buy more when it settles a bit later i think. I still like the stock.

Maybe.  But all it takes is one trip like we saw in the last hour to make most people take the money and run, not pump.  I don't know why people are comparing it to GME.  This is a non-existent company with no profit, no short, no nothing.  It's betting that every Conservative in the country wants to give money to Trump since they can't vote for him.  Even though a good portion of them don't know wtf a "stock" is.

Cashing out for 100+% gain only to see the stock continue to fly after you sell is a weird feeling.  It's like being sad about making a ton of money.  It makes no sense.  Sad. And Green.  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

Halts are based on the backlog order

The longer the halt, the bigger the buy or sell pending.

This system is so fuk up.  I understand circuit breakers (good and bad) but having stops qued up and the volatility jumping so far and orders not getting filled is BS.  I had 3 stop losses at same amount on different accounts, 2 got filled and 1 didn't.  It won't allow you to even set them now unless it's at bid level.  This sucks for people that buy in and don't set them early.

I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This fall I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into Southern American mango futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another fruit. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's mango yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Alabama and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the mango bubble burst on Oct 22. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for Halloween, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of Oct 22nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive mango shipment from Kentucky, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the mangos in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined.

As far as DWAC is concerned it’s way undervalued right now. The only thing that could kill the stock is if mango says or does something really really fucken dumb, so that’s 100% guaranteed, just have to be lucky and somehow sell right before that happens.

No liquidity, they have to.

Don’t spend the paper if you think we gonna taper.

Don’t by the call if you can’t lose it all.

Don’t call her a bitch when she’s the quad witch.

Don’t sell a put unless you collateral your foot.

Don’t buy the top if your lizard brain says stop.

Don’t chase the cheese if you can’t work on your knees.

It kills me how many people in this sub don’t understand halts or why they automatically happen. “Market manipulation” just fkn lmaoooo

That's like saying MSFT or AAPL or TSLA is old news

Trump and dump

Remember when we all made fun of the guy who bought GME at 150?

I saw it pop 170 for a sec, my guess is it wasn't retail who sold that.

Let their tears be the rain that washes over us

FB at a major discount!! FB is trading down on nothing but the negative press, fundamentally it's an incredible company. With the current short attention span news cycle we have, that FB itself helps create. The recovery will be swift and profitable.

Lol dead

I love how the sentiment changes every 2 minutes over here

I mean a $10B valuation for mango in this market is not unreasonable at all. Just gonna take a while as hype settles in. Regardless, this really goes to show why circuit breakers are so useful. This thing would've ticked at 500 if not for halts.

Out of DWAC with a bunch of money available. What’s the next play?

Hey honey that’s a lot of bags, did you go shopping? 

No, I bought 🥭

Crooked brokers revenge on the meme crowd - now halting trading just long enough for market to drop, then open for 2 secs to take overpriced limit orders, shut again before can close. Nice

Market manipulation on DWAC is crazy

PTLO printing today.!!!

NOK 0DTE $6c are currently only .02 with NOK sitting at $5.96 just 4 cents from the strike. 

No fckn way those things print but it's tempting to buy a thousand of them.

yeah a spac is a special purpose acquisition company that only exists as a publicly traded shell company for the sole purpose of merging with a private company (with a 24 month deadline to merge), and in that way the combined company becomes publicly traded.

In this case, DWAC the SPAC has announced a deal to merge with trump's company that at the moment has no product launched itself, and only vague rhetoric that that product will be some sort of social media app

I have not gotten any fucking work done in the last week. I’m fucking done.

Using this Trump stock to avoid paying my capital gains tax the hard way. $171 bag holder here

I mean I can imagine it just fine, it came and went. GME chart is some of the saddest shit I've seen in a market like this.

How many times has it been halted

How is this fucking legal!?

Damn!  Better buy a MAGA hat with some of those proceeds!  I was too scared to put much money into it because I’m a baby ape.

It seems to hurt more to sell for a profit and continue watching a stock rise than it does taking an actual loss.

I agree there should not be a limit up rule but it is what it is

Where are we allowed to talk about small cap stocks at a SP of over $5?


I cant seem to find a sub that will allow me to share DD on a damn near sure thing 4x return in 6-8 months.

Haha I sold at exactly 160, thanks for buying, come again next time!

I can predict the future what will happen at close:

\- new threads coming out "bought at 180 max price today, come back and save me 🍊"

\- new breed of "oranges" teams up to "tackle this very cool very legal market and do deep DD"

\- too many threads and spam here, similar to this videogame one

\- new "THE\_DWAC" subreddits are opened and circlejerk their bags

\- new dates will be posted to push out the eventual galaxy-landing and keep 'em hooked ("November 15th is when xyz happens", ... cue November 12th "listen, December 20th is when it actually happens". Rinse and repeat)

It plays a role, the electorate that voted for him deeply supports this because it’s going to be Fox News/ conservative social media on crack

Down at 121.

Imagine buying at 12 and selling at 161 in 24 hours. That would have been my Reno levelled up.

Im out. When the sec gets involved they force it down. Bunch of BS.

Lmao love how they imply the growing supply issues which seem worse and worse everyday, is now transitory. Just like inflation right? Man, these guys have a fuck load to lose to get back to reality

You realIze there is only like a 2 week window that if you bought you wouldn’t be up right now even at 170 . Virtually everyone who has bought the past year is up

I’ve got a feeling my other memes will never recover because I was following idiots, who continued in their idiocy and memed into mango hard.

Anybody want mangos? I bought 1000 for 175 a piece? They are extra thicccc and juicy 😩

Imagine not being in GME at least a little

No one is going to blame Robinhood. Everyone knows where and why it's halted now. This time is very different. Nasdaq is cutting it off, not the broker.

Yeah, you really need to learn to stop taking everything he does personally and looking for reasons to hate him. You don't know the whole picture of anything that's happened or is going on and you still keep wanting to think you do instead of checking yourself and researching some things.

You can see it however you want to see it, but your portfolio is telling you what's going on.

You need to stop this nonsense and stop holding grudges against a dude you think has harmed you in some way. Like, imagine having this big of a vendetta over some stuff he said a while back. Relax, dude. You haven't even met the guy, either.

Yeah, idiots.....

So is the biggest winner in this mango bull run mango man? How much richer did he get in the past 2 days?

I just don't see it that way and I made some money trading on his tweets.

Maybe being a foreigner whose country he made fun of and had actions who personally affected my family, I see him in a different way. I just don't think politics is just about the money and I'm only here in the US to make money lol. And I don't even think he did a good job with the economy. He cut things that help people to save money, but then he spent it on the wall which is already falling apart.

Regardless, the US will never feel like home because everyone here is out for money and don't care about each other. It's not really a country, it's just a group of people living together.

All the old memestocks are getting sucked dry by the ultimate memelord himself DONNIE MANGO. If he memed to presidency, then mango media is gonna gonna get memed to 420.69

Lol nice spin on that

There is a big regard push that's for sure.  But I don't think this has hit the mainstream yet.  Trump for all his faults has a lot of fans, and when options become available it is going to be nuts.

&amp;#x200B;

All this being said, it is at 130 now.  I don't think I'm going to buy in at this level, but I'm going to watch it closely and get in again if it dips to a "reasonable" level.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: of course right after I write that it shoots to 168 lol

whats the best play right now if i missed getting in yday?

Holy fuck, this is completely insane and I’m loving every fractional second of it trading.

The fun really starts when they release a few million more shares to cash in on the moron squad.

I mean low billions is cheap for a Trump media company... this is what happens when these other companies ignore half their market.

I think trump just sold his stock

I could have fomod into the spac stock at any point yesterday and still would’ve made 200% returns. Guh.

First congrats and I hope a bunch of you got rich. Second, market cap doesn't count the shares from warrants right? What is the actual market cap of mango taking those into account?

Here we goooo 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Was that technically a halt downwards on Mango?

Theory based on tin foil hat: it can either go the robinhood/GME way where they just kill the buy pressure to 'protect investors', or they realize they cant do that again because it would pull the curtain down, so theyre probably in conference calls with regulators trying to figure out what to do.

[removed]

there will be no trading on mango today. just microseconds of opening and halting.

Better sell by EOD😂😂

Was so close to dumping another $40k into DWAC yesterday but pussed out. Don't ever tell yourself that a stock can't reach a certain price - this market we have been in for the past year does not follow any kind of fundamentals. $500 DWAC soon, deal with it.

Why halted forever?

How long can they actually halt DWAC?  Could it be all day?

I see that.
It’s common to see insanely high bid prices on stocks that disappear. Not sure why it happens.
What’s weird is that there’s no other bids

Targeting about $250 DWAC but even if not, imagine still being in $GME

You didn’t. It’s on sale

got an email with an attachment asking me to pay $1000 to a certain online wallet. the body of the email is as follows

&gt;I want to ask how u have not chafed your hand till it bleeds? U jerk off so often that I think u have a particular technique, or it's unclear how your shaft is still okay. If u come across a man like u on the street, you won't think that, being alone, he practices that. Ur tenacity in ur creepy delights shocks me. But actually it's all is not related to our deal. When we're done, you would rather pay attention to you security, and begin at least covering the camera.
In case you defy my claims, within 90 hours u'd better get out of the country and change ur name, anyway u will no longer be able to live your former life. There is no other way, I am not going to review my requisitions, there's no use to text me, I'll delete the present email address. The timer starts now.

Nysex servers are smoking right

the mango p&amp;d is gonna be entertaining

The big exchange elites don't want fine Americans such as yourselves to make money. Many ppl tell me my spac is the best they've ever seen. Perhaps the greatest in the history of the United States. A good friend of mine, one of the best in the world at stonks, says he's never seen anything like it. Don't let the fake SEC and and the elite Wallstreet types at the exchanges tell you any different.

When the actual ticker goes live he'll make sure there are reverse stock splits through the ass to make it a 6 figure stock. Trump is very superficial so he'll want the highest stock price even if MC is trash compared to FB/AMZN/etc. It's all about the image of being successful/luxury without actually being so.

Who the fuck bought spy calls and made it shit the bed, I know it was one of you

Pelosi called up the sec and told them to do something..anything..

Get the warrants while the stock is halted they’re way cheaper too

Don’t tell me you hate money

Will never trade snap again. How the fuck did this impact ROKU? Not even the same advertising model.

Scary

20+ minute halt, seems normal 🥭

Yeah try to get out.  It can easily go to $25 tho lol

Just made 80k in a minute from $PHUN lmao

Oh fuck is this the black swan? Jesus Facebook tanking now so QQQ is going to hell

the warrants are running but the stock is halted? wtf

# MANGO IS GETTING 180 BIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's probably the 15min one

Stop the halt pwetty pwease

For real. Lol

They are the same except VOO has a lower expense ratio and tracks a little closer to the actual S&amp;P movement.  SPY is the most liquid ticker with tons of cheap options

This market is fucking hilarious

Spy is angry because of the halt.

Social media is down but I'm holding TWTR

I put a little in DWACW and it’s up almost 500% compared to DWAC’s paltry 160%.  Too bad I just did like $20 in the W one and now it’s over $120 profit lmao.

SEC has to be looking at inflows in this hence the longer half.

I have 8.5 shares of DWAC at 112.19 and no day trading left. I will take whatever restriction I need to be able to milk this. 

Let’s. Go. Brandon.

*barf*

Turns out 0dte FB 230c was an even more retarded move than I thought it was gonna be

You know they are gonna try and rig it since Trump is involved.

👀 easy ban.

u/Mr_Canada1867 banned if not $1,000 EOD

And once again Trump saved the US economy.

Because there is enough volume to play SPY daily. VOO is like once or twice a month expirations.

$200 by 10am boys. Get on the rocket before we leave the atmosphere. 🥭🥭🚀🚀✨✨💦💦

Ok can we get on with this already I have shit to do this morning

All I want is a 5% move on Tesla today &amp; CLF to ATH

Yeah, but at $14 I would have been more keen. But it’s way different from a $100+ price. At this point I might as well get calls on $TSLA and $COST instead.

bought 100 warrants just to feel a rush. warrants are not halted and still have yet to caught up to commons by a long shot

SPY has the most OI for short term FDs. So fun to gamble!

I can see DWACU from stock not options, but thank you for the help :D

This is blowing into the 150s the warrants are telling the story.

When you getting out?

Ya sad I missed it yesterday, I was outside burning a bunch of brush and shit.

If it is then it'd have to be happening so fast that the volume isn't being reported from the exchanges to fidelity, so I'm thinking that its still the same halt. Warrants are still trading and they're up to 64 now lmao

Mango with that GME energy, jesus.

The rug pull will be insane.

Averaged my dec 250 pypl calls down during that opening dip! Feels good, now I got damn near 30g’s in these calls so hopefully we start reversing today

Yep worried they may stop it

I had big regrets yesterday for not buying at 25 and 38, and now I sold a few other positions only to find out my broker don’t offer mango, I cheer for the lucky ones. This one seems like one of them you only see a few times in your trading life.

This rug pull is going to be brutal.

Truth Social and Facebook's correlation is actually less than -0.5 lol

Come on SPY don’t bitch out now. 456 today plz

Shares were already 10 baggers from 24 hours ago lol

Halts killing me

hmm I am not sure. never to late to change I guess

The longest halt in all of history. I don't even trade DWAC but it's a spectacle to watch.

200$ post halt. I’m buying now come back to this in 30 mins

the last IPO I got in on from RH did this too, nothing to see here it'll stabilize

$CLF mooning! 📈🚀

DWAC is going to tank and lose a lot of people a lot of money lol. If you’re buying in now then RIP

To all you you newbs asking about halts. Just sit back, slowly murmur let’s go Brandon and chill. They are a way for your heart rate to calm down a bit so you don’t have a heart attack.

This is an unusually long halt.

And we are finally back at ATH. Hopefully the permabears have learned that it's best to pivot back and forth between bear and bull by now.

Oh look, another day where SPY is up 🙄

NKE has been soaring this week and calls that I bought right before earnings @ 160 are almost fucking recovered on exp date. 

I can't believe it. Was staring at -98% for like almost a month and was convinced it was a total loss.

There are no options, there should be warrants(pretty similar to calls), just cheked there not. There are units sold, dwacu, but you need to check what's the redeption. DWACU = 1share DWAC + (1/2 OR 1/3 OR 1/4 OR 1)warant.

I thought volatility halts were only for 5 minute intervals. Is there a different halt time period if it happens in the first 41 seconds of open market?

Imagine where’d we be without Snap ruining the party

[removed]

I am sure you are not alone bro.

So in SNAPs earnings call they said companies were buying fewer ads because they were so supply constrained that there was no point in advertising to sell more.

Might just be SNAP making excuses, but this could also signal an overall downturn in revenue across the market

Bet mango's stock came up in conversation..

This halt is gonna fuck us or the open orders are gonna add 🚀 ⛽️

DWACW is a warrant contract stock on the underlying DWAC stock. A warrant is like an option contract, so think of DWACW as an option.

Who has the balls to buy DWAC at $100?

edit: $130

smart, with this you buy and sell the same day, just repeat

🥭 gonna need to announce a split soon

Yesterday 3 months of losses gone, Today 6 months of losses gone. Time for some Rum and Mango.

Let it begin

Get ready, 🥭 about to crash the whole fucking market.

Wtf is going on

What is the mango thing

If you didnt get into 🥭 just stop you’re just go a bag hold 

Alot of people hitting sell today

[removed]

lol GL with that

I have $84 left in my options account... Am I doing this right?

Yeah looked at it around $19 when it was already up 100% and never imagined it would run up this much.

You talk like a kid. If you’re actually a adult then I feel really bad for you and I will prey for you even though I’m a atheist. Now get ready for school and remember if you don’t finally stand up for yourself for once they will continue to bully you and take your lunch money. Tell those bullies you’re not a cuck anymore and aren’t going to take it.

Good luck 🍊 chasers! Jesus 139 PM. Too bad I’m a 🌈🐻

Apes buying Dwac is gonna be the event that makes the Sec 'regulate' retail stock trading because it has been 'gamified' and because it is 'too fun'.  Dems in control can't have people making money off of mango meme stocks.

I guess the answer is yes, you should have

[removed]

i like big bags

As it sits at 115 🤡

I feel it in my plums that TSLA doesn't close over $900 today

Still not buying puts

Will mongo open to instant circuit breaker? Whats the rules when stock dbls before open?

That’d be the best high ever

DWAC options are not available in IBKR :(

You can trade them right now just like shares. Only if your holding long long term things change

it’s not too hard if you make your own state

HOLY FUCKARONI!!!!! HAHAHAHA

is this the fastest growing stock of all time?

10 at creation to 110 the next day must be a record.

Shit, 500sh at $83 was not enough. Should have gone all in.

Un fuckin real this is great

I got a cousin who’s ‘tarded. 

He’s a millionaire now.

So happy my eod DWAC buy wasn’t as retarded as I thought it was going to be. Good luck at the casino everyone

This mini-pump before market open is sus af

You may be able to get back in sub 100 after profits are taken for the next ride up

Whatre some opinions yall have on SNAP right now?

Right shoulda just held and been faithful tbh. I caught the move so good but figured take profits and throw it at something else that dipped

Holy shit we mooning boys

What is going on with PHUN?

Up 400% premarket.  Is this part of the mango hype?  Any truth to the association?

All these people buying dwac never played a spac, it’s going to dump on open isn’t it?

Edit: I was wrong, the buyers are stupider than I thought. The road to merger is going to be hilarious, so much loss porn probably.

What the fuck am I even looking at?

Agreed. Wait for the dip after early morning surge to buy more.

There are only like 36 million shares. I think there will be plenty of people willing to hold out of 74 million voters. Plus, Russia probably has half the shares.

This is fucking insane. Major face palm energy rn

[removed]

Ok, gotcha.

"you're not that guy pal... trust me"

This is more ridiculous than GME

Holy shit $500 mango 🥭 might come sooner than expected

So is this sub going back to ape mode?

Annnd time to put some coffee on and wait for the roller caster. This is glorious 🥭

ARE YOU CUCKS GONNA WAIT UNTIL $200!? 🥭

That happened already. 200 next.

Lol

If all my portfolio wasn't in uranium, i'd be yoloing it all on DWAC. 
Dafuq is going on 🤣

People laughed at me when I said $100 today at $30 yesterday lol

These are going to be the biggest bags of all time

[removed]

I heard about it at $20 and didn't get it; plus I would have panic sold yesterday at $40.

They're poor hicks though

Hey dumbass, it’s Friday. EOD = EOW

Puts on DWAC

it was being mentioned yesterday morning and afternoon. I bought in at $13 , sold at $25 , bough back in end of day at $40 or whatever

$102 now

This article is gibberish

Nope, cashed out at $72 this morning, I dun goofed.

Jesus, what even is your endgame???

I thought the only thing PDT designation does is prevent you from day trading for a certain amount of time if your account is below $25,000. If it’s above that you can day trade as much as you want. You’ll get the “PDT” label after 4 days trades but it doesn’t mean anything before or after that point if you have $25k.

There was a 1500% turnover rate yesterday implying every single share on average was traded over 15 times.

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)

Looked at 🥭 at 15 and thought “fuck that” 🤡

I heard it’s DWAC puts?

Patience my friend. Rate hikes are coming

I bought 10 shares of DWAC yesterday at 12… sold at 18 like an idiot but.. I’m trying hard not to shoot my self in the leg 😂

Lmao don’t be a hater fellow ape, I bet you don’t even have any shares

Dwac is 94$ should I buy in?  Hmmm 🥭

Wanna see how to turn red into green? Only takes 4 minutes.

~~Depends on how hard Trump supporters go in. Odds are the ones that want to throw money at this don't understand how to get in and will go buy merchandise instead.~~

~~GME had some logic behind it, this is pure hype.~~

~~Shits gonna be wild either way.~~

🥭🥭🥭🥭🥭

Ita really a shitty feeling knowing you missed out on huge life changing ( not millions, but enough to allow me to move and start fresh) money with the mangoes. I can't risk getting in now, and even if I did at this point I can't make as much of a return.  God dammit.

PYPL going to go down another 5% today? Not helping my calls, but definitely helping my share purchasing.

Bs. Money is king in this capitalist system. Get money. Ride the momentum

Is robinhood already tampering, this time I will drag them in court if true. Won’t let me fill my 🥭order

prepare for the halt

yeah I'm not opposed to making money on it, I have no political allegiances when it comes to gambling lol. I just hope people go into this with their eyes open and understand what is going on.  Anything involving trump, lots of people who aren't him have a history of losing money.  This thing is going to go skyhigh and then dump when investors start pulling out.

Not gonna lie it’s fun watching the mango stock (also not touching it with a ten foot pole).

HOOD calls for tues earnings.   Thinking 43-45 strikes. Buying today on any dip.  I think monday will be too late

Trump has literally 500 running businesses. Yeah, when you've opened up 500+ businesses, some are bound to fail, math genius. How many have *you* opened up? I bet I can guess the number!

You're comparing a dude with 500 businesses to a bunch of tech nerds only running a handful, on top of that.

Donald Trump has never opened a Tech business until now. Yeah, he'd be much higher on the totem pole on net worth if he had. But, why is net worth even *relevant*, here? You're literally just attacking the dude on every front possible with no actual point in sight. He opened up a tech business now and he'll likely gain a ton of net worth soon after that, judging by the stock's trend.

Like, what's the point of your whole shtick, here? Orange Man is Bad therefore everything he does is bad? Is that it? Are you sure you're looking at this with critical objectivity or are you just yet another mindless drone consumed with superficial hatred? And I'm supposed to believe you, a random dude on the Internet, just because you "work in the industry" related to what he's doing with no evidence anywhere to be found? Be serious.

Please give the orange orangutans their own thread

I’m thinking 220 at least. That’s where GME went and that was just WSB. This thing is half the US big.

Dwac wowzers

I don’t think so. It looks like it’s going nuclear at open. Could hit 200+ just depends how long the whales stay in.

I was told I was getting banned because a certain stock was under $90, and I couldn’t mention it.

Purely on speculation...but we're playing.

Yea I saw that they cut guidance ahead of earnings. I guess they figure if they get ahead of the bad news they will get a bump from actual earnings.

Early investors in DWAC are pulling out after they learn Trump is behind it.  Apparently his involvement was very well shielded to attract investors.  None of the hedge funds want to be associated with a fake news platform (their words)  Saba Capital and another anonymous 10% stakeholder divested from the company yesterday as news broke that it was Trump's social media platform.

A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica which is believed to have originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two distinct types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type". Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.  
  
Worldwide, there are several hundred cultivars of mango. Depending on the cultivar, mango fruit varies in size, shape, sweetness, skin color, and flesh color which may be pale yellow, gold, green, or orange.The mango is the national fruit of India, Pakistan and the Philippines, while the mango tree is the national tree of Bangladesh.

This premarket is so fucky. Maybe I'll just watch today instead of play

Kinda weird when people are like “why is this dumping” and then you zoom out to 5 years and see it went from $110 in 2020 to 243 in $2021 after being flat for 3 years prior. 

Lot more “dumping” to be done. This is just the beginning. Nothings actually dumped yet.

For real. Everytime a meme stock spikes the overall market has a selloff

I’m late to the party, what is this 🥭 everyone’s talking about and more importantly, should I be risking my college savings on it like everyone else?

If it gets killed, then the mango platform will get a guaranteed 10M users, making stock go up even higher. It's a win

if it goes to 156, you'll feel smart buying at 90...

That's the problem.

I agree that domestic terrorists will use this...but nobody here is 'investing' in shit. We're taking their money. And in my case, I'm using part of the profits to fund Dems in the next election, lol

&gt; It's a company called GME. They're going to IPO soon and we should buy some.

$DWAC

I think it’s against the rules to mention, but that hasn’t stopped ppl before

Sneak peak of today’s market: Everything red except  🥭

Yes people are scalping or getting out to new bagholders. Just don’t be the last one

Would it be retarded to buy 🥭 now? I just bought 50 shares

GME and AMC were also retarded at $100 and $40 respectively but they ran. Make some money and bounce.

&gt; No, the market cap of Mango is $1.8B

Can confirm, just bought

Ya selling calls next week and raking in those juicy premiums

Small Brain - buying 🥭 for $20 at 4AM EST premarket yesterday using WeBull

Medium Brain - buying 🥭 for $12.40 at 7AM EST premarket when most brokerages starts trading

Big Brain - buying 🥭 for $10.40 after you wait out the weird heavy selling pressure

Ape Brain - Ape'ing into 🥭 at $90

Get in before Cathie tanks the stock and buys at $300

[removed]

well, you know Russia is pumping it

His pac already raised almost $300m before this.

 Next.

If there is only 25m float in Mango, doesn’t that mean the volume is all people getting in and out quickly which means few are holding?

I can’t wait to short this back all the way down

So basically you're no different and missed out

Unfortunately it was on a dollar scratch off.

No, I’m betting that the platform is going to suck ass and it won’t get much traction after a few months. Add that with the fact there’s not many companies that want to get into business with Trump.

Thanks doctor! It's nice to have someone informed in the community.

I honestly didn't know anyone could get a sore back from dancing until I experienced it first hand. Would not recommend lol

Look kiddies.  This is your opportunity to stop being a whiny baby and to flip a meme stock into owning a home.  Bought the gme hype train back in Jan. for huge gains that helped with a home downlayment.  You have chance #2 here with Dwac.   Or you can just clutch your panties and continue to wait in the sideline because you think it is already 'too late' then go pump common dreams garbage articles in other subs that whine about the housing market prices and young people being priced out and bitching that we need govt to take over housing.  Get creative trying to own a home or wallow in your bitchfest.

I'm not sure he got many (or any) shares. None of the filings seem to indicate as much...

Lmao imagine if the mango stock is how this sub finally gets the axe

Operation 🥭🥭🥭 in full force

Thanks.

I guess I didn't miss the inside joke then. Got in/out quick for a small profit this morning.

As a TSLA trader yeah, I’m thinking it will pussyfoot around 900 like it did with 800 before finally melting through

I will laugh my ass of if SPY goes guh today

I get that it's the rule, but this particular spac is the biggest bet on wall street right now. It's silly to think the degenerates are just gonna pretend it's not happening.

Sounds like someone with a dry beak

lol ya okay

Thanks. I didn't know it for real.

I wouldn’t buy calls at open to be honest. No today. I probably wouldn’t wait closer to when JPow speaks.

Lol this is so obvious:

🥭 pop at open
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 drop at open

Yeah Microsoft "accidently" forgot to refine Windows 11 for AMD. The biggest effect is on gen 2 Ryzen which is taking a 15% performance hit right now.

But Microsoft is also the biggest threat to Intel right now since Windows 11 is going to be trash, and, with the M1 pro and max, Apple's looking to capitalize. 

But Intel's not just a cpu company

It's a SPAC and all these assholes should be banned.

Investing 10k into 🥭 yesterday would've been life changing for me but low capital people need to stay poor for the economy to have a work force.

Such is life.

I agree it'll likely dip at open, but there is still some room for profit on this one at least for the short term IMO.

This is the retahded DD we need

The also want to compete with AWS,😂

For the love of 🥭i guess

Exactly, the volume will come, and with such a small float it could rip past $500 next week

Ppl shitting on 🥭 for failed businesses fail to understand that it doesnt matter. We buy tf outta companies that trade on 100x sales and no products all the time. Who cares, just make money, it doesnt have to be personal or political. Dont be red or blue be GREEN🤑🤑🤑

oh lawdy I can't wait. I hope I time it and get out before hand, but even if I don't it'll be a fun day

Pro tip buy mango

I think Gabs issue is the left - not to get political just describing users - don't have the numbers on Gab to diversify it so you don't have echo chambers for the left so the left end up seeing the right.

Now imagine if Gab was as large as Twitter the posts would be so numerous that echo chambers would develop. Twitter has a shit ton of nazis they are just within their echo chamber just like the antifa tribe are in theirs. You have to seek it out or be part of the community to see it.

That's the drawback of social platforms is that echo chambers are safe spaces. If people don't have them they feel attacked. If they do have them you end up with a cycle of content where hate breeds hate because their is no counter argument. So instead of seeing people you end up seeing an attribute and you no longer want to help the person you only see hate.

That is called situational design and it is fundamentally what is wrong with social currently. It's a cess pool of both extremes breeding hate against each other.

The wall will be teared down, it will be more badass than the fall of the Berlin wall.

ok then it's allowed now WAADDYAAA WANT

Wow, look guys, an actual retard!

Wow, your reading skills are terrible.

I did get in at the lows, but no way I could've held expecting this.  I'm  on the sidelines too now.

Why?

Either way, there are always bag holders in these games.

and back again to 81

Who cares. 300% gains are still a 3 bagger. On shares. Cant wait til options open up

Is he though, he's had an insane amount of failed businesses... How many failed businesses does Elon musk have? Mark Zuckerberg? The Google guys? Steve Jobs??? Trump has had more failed businesses than all of them combined. His net worth is less than any of them.. even after starting out with more than them... I don't care about him, but I work in this industry and it's laughable anyone thinks he has a chance

Bank earnings fucking killed it again, SPY mooning past 460

Look at American Express up 2.3% rn

The fuck are you talking about, it basically hasn’t moved in a few days. It needs to firmly break and hold above 180 and then 200 to confirm it’s out of this downtrend. Otherwise it could just sit here for months for all you know

YUUUUUGGGGEEE

BABA be a good boy and open at 180

Im pretty sure participating in a coordinated pump &amp; dump is against the law.

I agree. T_D and .win were huge and I think most conservatives don’t want to resort to the fringe online communities that still exist. This would be perfect.

How you feel about going to sleep as a wsb mod and waking up to being a Qanon sub mod?

Buying more SOFI leaps. Once their banking charter is approved, it will probably exceed its $30 price target.

Do you know how many lawsuits have been thrown at Trump his whole life, dude?

Lawsuits are a literal part of being a businessman. You think Facebook and Apple don't regularly face lawsuits over alleged plagiarism and whatnot? 

You need to chill tf out and reassess your obsession with this dude. He's a top businessman, backed by financial investors who already have seen his business plans. You are not a financial expert with secret knowledge. You are an everyday citizen, like me, posting on a forum. Humble yourself.

Sure, in your shoes Google is a much better choice. However for brick and mortar retail locations and ecommerce I've found Facebook's pixel to be a much more powerful tool that leads to much cheaper conversions. To 100% generalize that it's not even working on instagram thots is just incorrect.

Hey, genius.

I'm clearly talking about the news being three weeks old.

Wait, the fact it's three weeks old... A lawsuit... A three week old lawsuit? You're pointing out there it's three weeks old? You realize it hasn't started yet right? So you think DWAC or truth didn't exist three weeks ago?

Okay, let's actually break down how dumb what you're saying is. I've worked as a tech lead on several of the platforms he's trying to recreate... Do you know what the salary for a fresh grad at these companies is? Over 200k, a senior is probably making $500k or more. There's no way, this cheapskate could ever afford a single decent engineer. Thus why his site has already been hacked.

The whole platform is built off of an open source project that's already suing him. From a technical standpoint, this app will literally suck.i know that. You know that. That's why he's begging for his Twitter back, because truth is going to be an unusable pills of shit

GME just doesn't care. They dump it with full force, but can't keep it low for long right now. Apes bought the dip once again

I paper handed my spy calls at close after scalping the last dip of the, so obviously we opening like +.35%

Some smart people are going to make a lot of money with this and even more are going to lose their ass. I know I fuck up entries and exits on the regular so I'll just enjoy the show.

Mangos will rot badly

From a jealous guy who is watching on the sidelines

I'm sure they'll be a sell off, but then people that just heard about it last night will be buying in I'm sure. I just can't do it because I won't be able to buy &amp; sell shares today (since I don't have margin yet) and don't want to hold them until next week

$100 is not a meme , you missed out on 900% gains if you didn't buy yesterday premarket while it was dumping super hard because of shorts selling pressure

It’s legal to run a SPAC up like this ? haha

He knows alot of people and has lots of connections . Never forget that.

Facebook, the previous mango network, is almost 1T. There is no way New mango is worth less than 500B

Insanity. Was worried when I woke up but 100 EoD at this point

It’s stock. Just buy some and set a trailing stop loss with a market sell.

Nope!

Look at the volume it’s going to be crazy today

I see a lot of bag holder talk, which I always take as meaning you missed the trade. Also, a lot of degens making or made money and everyone is a grown adult. Wat you don’t  realize on this one is that a shit pile of folks dgaf if they hold some bags.

But I thought you were done? Seems like a bunch of words for a done guy. Also it's not a huge majority sir. China? Snapchat in China? That a thing? Snap going the way of FB. It's the cycle of life. Young people have moved on to TT. Your demographic uses snap. Along with your parents, so they can feel close to you. Snap probably has about 10 years left. It's in its way out.

Mango GME AMC for the win Alex

There’s a good documentary about what happened on The Crow, I’ll try to find it for you and it explains the process of making a mass amount of blank rounds for a movie set and also making dummy rounds for other shots in the movie with no powder and how it can get mixed up. I’m assuming that’s what happened on this set as well

Edit: it’s an unsolved mysteries episode about Brandon Lee

If your not going mango today then you have no balls I will be buying at whatever price market open

The best part of 🥭 is that the self righteous “apes” won’t come in and ruin everything. I’m here to make money not crash the worlds financial system.

You seem very… sensitive about this topic.

COCO went public yesterday.  The company makes tons of cash and it has positive earnings with PE around 20 and it is growing fast internationally. This is a buy stock. Currently is discounted to its IPO price from yesterday. It should go up 10% or more per day until it doubles IPO price. By the way Dr Pepper also bought a huge chunk of the shares at the IPO price of $15.

Same people buying both

My theory on Facebook is $304 puts. For sure it goes to $317 today and holds but their is a point to be made no one uses Facebook to advertise to even Instagram thots. My towing business sure as hell don’t use Facebook. Not snap nor Twitter. I do use google though. Surprised Yelp ain’t crashed yet.

Bro try a nice girl for a change. Date a couple nice girls and then you’ll find yourself a nice middle ground. It works - I used to stick my dick in crazy (got burned) then went safe and sane for a while (got bored) and then I met my wife.

I’m not buying it, but the market cap is still very low relative to the potential

Once the company is known to be shit so will the stock. Can definitely make money on it for now though

That logic makes absolutely no sense. Let me rephrase my statement again. I’m not talking about every single person in the world. When I say everyone I’m saying a huge Majority of the people on this world use Snapchat. Look at the numbers of users is you have to. I don’t understand how you are arguing against that. Called me dumb but it sounds like you’re a fucking moron. Here let me give you an award so you feel better .

i also think it is going higher but idk how much

rug pull is imminent but idk how to time it. personally i don't have the spare cash to play it plus i'm on the fence about it anyways

#buy mango now or FOMO at 400

You guys know FOMOing with stocks is way safer than FOMOing with options by simple fact of stop loss mechanisms on less radical price shifts?

Feel free to throw your house into Mango stock. Just set a stop loss.

I asked her to send me my favorite hoodie back and she isn’t going to. Like wtf bro 😥. Then she said that she still wants to stay friends and talk all the time. Honestly I really really shouldn’t have driven home with where my head was at yesterday. Not feeling much better today either. She makes me feel like trash.

I posted my theory about what was going to happen. If they can’t capture ad revenue when usage it at an all time high is doomed. 

$SNAP is going to Snap
What’s up fellow apes? I’ve got some luke warm speculation that may become boiling hot in the coming months. And what is that? It is the fact that $SNAP is over valued … tremendously. They’ve been hovering at an all time high for quite some time. We all know it’s a dying app. Instagram and Tik tok are taking over their usage, not users, but usage. Public Snap data provides active users based on number of users who open their application within a 24 hour window and not the amount of time spent on the app. Which, I feel would mislead advertisers because personally I open Snap for less than 4 minutes a day. I assume it is the same for others. 

There’s a bigger factor at play here. The COVID Effect. How long do we think the average user is spending on the app? These users, especially the young ones, haven’t been in school or have been working from home which provides them the freedom to use their phone without consequences. Average time spent on the app by users HAS to be on the decline as the world reopens. There’s a reason why they don’t share this data with advertisers. 

So, if the average time spent on the app by user is on the decline, then their sole source of revenue, advertising, would likely be on the decline or advertisers would be sceptical of using their platform. 

Also, has anyone seen click through ads on other platforms that open up Snap? I have on on Twitter and Instragram. That seems like a Hail Mary if I’ve ever heard of one. 

Earnings call is coming up this month which is expected to be positive for the first time. Don’t let it fool you. Or, maybe I’m a fool. So take this DD with a grain of salt.

They're not always your friend with volatile stocks. If a stock gets halted and then drops instantly, your stop loss may fuck you over big time as the executed price might be extremely low, way under what you wanted. And then you see your shit sold at the lowest point and then the price bounces back (or deadcats) and you wanna smash your screen.

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Chocostick27 (0/1) made a bet that ASML would go to 820.0 when it was 790.72 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

I don’t think it will fuck FB Twitter

Not even instagram anymore. TicTok,

Yeah, I saw that when I did a search.

Three weeks old. But, let's talk about it, I guess.

Nobody knows exactly why Mango wanted his Twitter back. Could have been for a number of reasons. Could have been giving them a last shot before he ripped their faces off in the market. Could have needed some data or code from them to fuel his own platform ideas. I don't know. You don't know. "Get his account back" implies he wanted to rejoin the platform. No, he just wanted his account reinstated. That's not necessarily a plea to come back to the platform, on his knees and teary eyed.

But, think about it for like a minute. Why *would* Mango want his Twitter restored while he's in the middle of making his own platform, with deals already lined up behind him for financial support? If you want to go brain dead and just say, "Hurr durr, it's cuz he's stoopid," then it's no wonder you folks lose money.

These are important questions we need to be asking, instead of jumping to conclusions that support our own bias for or against him.

Quarantine thread please

What an absolute roller coaster of a week. I’ve worked for a startup for 3 years that burns money at a good rate. Two weeks ago we almost run out of money, and a new investor comes in to rescue us. He gives us this rah rah speech saying he put in hundreds of thousands of dollars to get everyone paid up through the year, and has a 5 hour meeting with us establishing quarterly goals.  Comes back in on Monday and has the same type of meeting with us. 

Tuesday that mother fucker holds an emergency board meeting and calls a vote to liquidate which passes 9:1. For two days I’m scrambling trying to find a new income.

Thursday that brilliant mother fucker resigns from the board, and offers to buy the company for pennies on the dollar. Offer has to be accepted legally due to the liquidation.

I get banned today any way.  Going to lose a bet.

Gap up on Monday, because over the weekend it will gain a lot more attention. That's how it worked for GME, and for NEGG.

We all know spy went up for like a year straight. This is not time to buy puts this is still time to buy calls. Spy had its jaw dropping 2 months almost of straight dropping. Remember what happened before sept

DWAC. This thing is going to 500. Think digital money. Think doggy coin. Everyone looking at MARKET CAP.

If the market is going full retarded you have to go full retarded too. If you only go half retarded you're done for.

GME, AMC and Doggy coin can all sustain ridiculous valuation because a TAM of idiots fanatically support it.

The new valuation metric is: TAM of idiots/market cap and boy is DWAC undervalued

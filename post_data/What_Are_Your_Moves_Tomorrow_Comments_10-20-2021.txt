What’s the best stock to buy?
The next Daily Discussion thread is [here](https://redd.it/qbxd7v)
So how green are we gonna be tomorrow? 455 would be sick
Sell it then. Put the money into a stock that is actually rising.
Why isn’t anyone talking about coin
Man it's been like a week
I actually bought AMD at 4 dollars back in the day but sold shortly after.  I was still super broke back then.  But I don't support FSLY I don't see it comparable at all.
I wish I could be so confident when I have no idea what I’m talking about.

We never break the limit, we always raise it. Literally how is it possible to be as retarded as you are? 

The issue is not the dollar amount, the issue is all the bullshit surrounding raising it. When our congress shoots itself in the foot every time the ceiling comes around because someone wants to use defaulting as a bargaining chip it is a total embarrassment to our country and a completely unnecessary downward force on the stock market which is really what I care about most. No where did I say we need to reduce spending. We just need to raise the ceiling but congress is so fucking ineffective at doing that. It’s almost as big of a joke as your reading comprehension
I kind of did with like half my money. I’m up a lot on BABA which is why I believe this run will either stagnate or pullback. Universe can’t let me win I’m telling you just inverse me. I’m all in Oil and BABA
I don’t know if this is a bit and you are trying to be funny . But yes. Thank you god for the person who came across the discovery in science to save human lives .

Lol bro had you yoloed all your money in baba 2 weeks ago and hold it. You'll be in an amazing place right now.
Imagine buying something that was a pennystock anywhere near these levels. Nevermind,  fits the theme around here

Why do you want pussy to taste like cucumbers. Maybe you are the gay vegetarian
How we taste depends on what and how we eat.

Not sure yet
Whats Asml currently atm?
The vax was supposed to be better so idk
I won my banbet suck it visualmod
What the hell happened there?
🤣 Classic
Just moving on. If you trade enough you realize that there will always be another play. I bitch about selling too early here, but for the rest of the day I don’t really think about it. 

That and every time I see some diamond handed retard losing all his gains because he didn’t sell, I realize that I should be satisfied with the fact that I still made money.
ASML HUGE er miss, may put a drag on semis today...
ME AND YO MAMA SHOPPIN AT ALIBABA!!
What’s the point of vax if we acting like nothing changed
You will never buy the absolute bottom or sell the absolute top.

I somehow manage to do the opposite multiple times a day though.
$BA watching it closely to break above 220$. Good news coming in for 115 firm orders for 777X from Dubai's Emirate Airlines.

"if i sold my SRPT Jan 22 call a week ago before the surprise stock offering, I would have $800 instead of $285." This type of brutality has been happening to my calls, this year especially
Holy NVAX!

There are always more trades to do, you exit a trade because you think that's the most profitable action you can take given your risk tolerance. I prefer to miss crazy extra gains once than to lose money consistently because I hold for too long expecting crazy gains.
By doing hundreds of them. I've had tiny plays make 1000% and I've had massive plays make $20 when they could have made thousands. You do enough of them and you get desensitized to it and just move on to the next trade.

I mean yeah, if you missed out on life changing money then you might kick yourself and examine your strategy pretty hard. But as long as your trades are in the green, you're technically winning. That means a lot over longer periods of time.
Are you allowed near teenagers? I assume most of this sub can’t go to their local mall due to court orders.

You sure about that

Magnesium shortages in CCP are pushing US magnesium manufacturers to the moon. 

Can't make aluminum without magnesium, can't make cars or trucks without aluminum.

Car shortage is gonna get worse, but trucking is a bigger concern.  

Run up is already complete, but a reasonably timed short position in magnesium the second you hear China is resolving their power difficulties may result in some decent Burger King for you degenerates.

I don’t think so, most college educated individuals (good major) in todays age can easily earn 100k in a wide variety of jobs by their 30’s. Many companies have raised salaries for mid management and the like due to the rise in minimum wage. For fucks sake even in Florida we have $10 an hour with a $1 increase every year till $15 in ‘26. You can still buy a great home for $400k it’s just that if you want to live near a giant city it’s not going to be possible due to inflated pricing.

I did, I was hoping one of the mods on the sub would take it down but it stayed up for half a day with hundreds of comments. It got removed shortly after I reported it to Reddit. Reddit isn't the problem though, there are discords and other communities. It's the nature of the dynamic that is scary. They are highly motivated and fully immersed in a group that believes that this powerful cabal is keeping them from their rightful untold riches through a vast web of conspiracies. There is no way that dynamic has a happy ending.
You better record and post it
If you post a picture flexing $1000 I’m going to assume that’s all the money you have and you are a poor. Why do people still do this…

Ok so hear me out. Supply chain being fucked up causes demand to be higher than supply. Companies will have to raise prices to temper demand, and increase their margins. Probably a good thing considering people aren't going to work for less than $20 an hour right now.

It's too late to apologies, it's too laaaaate
check below.  Just not sure that FSLY is bringing much to the table these days especially as more and more players are entering the decentralized data space.  Even established telcos are starting to provide localized data services and that can have long term negative effects on data providers like FSLY since the telcos will always be able to guarantee the best possible connection and rates to data since they control the pipes.  FSLY also took a big drop over the past year and I feel it was for legitimate reasons not related to the overall economic troubles.  It's much different than Cloudflare.  I feel that CloudFlare has built up a base and built up trust in the industry, and the services they provide are fairly niche.  but fastly has not.  I just don't see where fastly is providing a competitive edge, but I'm not an expert, I'm just an idiot with a passive interest in this shit, for real.  If someone has better news about fsly I'm open to it.

some people will be burned at the stake for what was done to Britney Spears, this shit was done to her while she was in the spotlight, imagine how much this happens to those without any voices in the dark, imagine how much more severe the crimes against humanity must be when there’s zero fear of consequences. it has been and still is the holocaust for those deemed “mentally ill” ever since “mentally ill” has been used as a believable excuse to abuse those who are simply different, a Nobel prize was won not too long ago for lobotomizing them, the same thing is still done now, only it is done with state-sponsored kidnapping/false imprisonment/torture and court-ordered brain-castrating chemicals

what happened to NVAX? -25%
I mean they already announced it, but probably lol. Verizon also trading at 52 wk lows but T trading at like 10-20 year lows or something like that… If you wanna sell puts on something “safe” and not afraid to baghold those two are like the best choices lol
Good for them.  I'll have to pop in my local one and check it out.  I go to the mall still as it is.  Might as well hit best buy.

I used to love Best Buy.  I remember seeing the demo console of N64 in there and it blowing my fuckin' mind.  Ever since physical media for music and movies fell out of fashion, I've had no real reason to go in there.  It's been about eight years maybe.  Seemed the emphasis was on major appliances and cell phones.  What's it like now?

Yoooo holy fuck. I have just been reliably informed that the plan for the GME crowd now after they register their shares with “computershare” or whatever is “to never sell, so the shorts can never cover”

Not making this up, a person just said this to me. The plan is that the shorts are never able to cover, so GME skyrockets and just becomes the most valuable asset around and the banks will be giving out loans to these people against their shares of GME. 

I had no idea that this was the new plan. Been seeing them talk about computershare but I never bothered to actually look in to what they were talking about. Someone should make a dystopian horror movie with this as the premise lmao
Some do some don’t

Find someone you trust, create a loan term with them.  Loan them everything with a payback due in 30 years. File paperwork on loan.  It is important that no payments start in near future. At most she can get the contract, but the loan terms will keep her from getting your money.  Now Friend can loan you the money back.  Follow same process.  Both at some future date can close the contact and forgive the loan. Loan money to you was acquired after papers were served and thus should not be included in divorce settlement.

If you never sell shorts can never cover. 

You can take a loan out against direct registered shares but not against shares in your broker.

That should tell you what you need to know about holding stock in your name. The banks recognize that as golden collateral. 

That's how the rich play, take out loans against their holdings and make more returns and on and on.

Also yes, GME about to revolutionize the market, with or without a squeeze. Fundamentally undervalued til its at 1k a share
But what if you win money??...

Okay, that’s even more ridiculous. So, it’s tempting to just type “LOOOOOOOL” in response to this but now I’m curious. What is the point if you never sell? You think that GME will go to 1 million per share or whatever and just never come down? It will become the new standard the market revolves around or what? How do you make money from it if you don’t sell?
😔

Last Month: CHINA BAD!!!! SELL BABA!!!!! GOING TO 0!!!!!  


This Month: CHINA GOOD!!!! BUY BABA!!!! GOING TO 300!!!!!!  


Has anything changed: No.
The plan for Computershare is to never sell.. if the entire float is locked up in CS and GME is over 100% short, shorts could never cover without those shares no matter how many we sell in our commie TD or Webull brokers.
&gt; I'm sorry to hear that.

In my experience, the most complicated, reasonable, "can't go tits up" arguments are almost always wrong. Life finds a way 99% of the time.

The absolute best thing you can do is find a few Chinese stocks you like and trust and put some of your port in there. If you lose everything, oh well, but right now the China fud is so juicy that any LEAPs you have will fucking print by exp date. Low risk, high reward imo.

Typically we saw the market crash hard when GME rocketed.
The US economy is clearly built on cheap and near slave labor imports.

It was inevitable that these low costs were unsustainable however your economics experts told you cheap tshirt, tv, and computer there is no inflation.

That is the correction case
Well fuck em.

Maybe the adoption of it in ETFs
Imagine taking $500 dollars from a hard earned paycheque and buying 3 shares of GME thinking its going to pop 10k a share overnight
Yea just pure technicals

Yes bro, this is OUR time!
thats a lotta dominos that you've got lined up there
Idk how one can think let alone say out loud GME will go to 10k a share. You’d have to be a completely fucking brain dead vegetable to make a post like that. Keep dreaming 😴
After looking through your comment history, I will buy puts
What’re ya waiting for E???
Idk if "missing the rally" is a bull case...

But I don't got anything against BA. Not a bull nor bear on it so godspeed to you.

Imagine being this delusional and idiotic and thinking you’re the smartest guy in the room

I haven’t actually looked in to it but I saw someone saying that with that computershare registering shit you can’t sell immediately, that it would take like a week to actually sell the stock or something. That can’t be true, right? Because if it is true that’s too funny to actually be real
I talk with my ass
Whos reaction
Is drinking yourself to sleep every night while rubbing your fingers against the cold metal of the revolver under your pillow considered graceful?
Ahaha shit I gotta cop me one of them thangs .ahaha fuckin whiskey dick is not the buisness

time for ape extinction
If my past self saw what kind of shit I sometimes say on WSB, and how often I comment, he'd probably end the timeline early. Never thought I would be this involved
That’s the only saving grace from my standpoint. But fuck even the state is looking riskier and riskier. I think like 50% of state run companies defaulted last yr? Independent of the RE mess right now

you could open that mouth so large trump wouldnt belive it
Travel stocks will lead the rally tomorrow, UAL reported a better than expected ER and forecast looks good. Airlines will need more and newer planes as they retired many old planes. Watch BA closely to bounce back above 220-225$.

well up +50% in the context of everything else. Zero volume, largest whales endlessly dumping, crazy huge market buys and sells which no one would place unless they were trying to push the price, stablecoins burning hundreds of millions at the same moment corn is ripping, no movement in any of the small shitco:ns, all miner selling goes to absolute zero in the middle of September. All sorts of weirdness

Also just look at a chart of the PA since the beginning of October compared to any other time. Btc rips up and then down and then up and then down. Now it just slowly marches up step by step without any retraces at all, even in the face of the largest wallets in the world dumping thousands of BTC. It's crazy

Degenerate
Many people and institutions over there are going to get fucked, but I don't think China is going to let an economic collapse happen. They are absolutely desperate to be the world's biggest economy and will do anything to get there just to say "gg ez no re" to the US.

How are they going to prevent it? I don't know, but I'm positive that a ruthless, totalitarian government can find a way.

BA- Attention! Calling the last passenger to board before gates are closed.

Bullish flow of about $1.5 million in call options. High volume of $220 and $225 for Oct 22 were bought at ask or above ask price. BA has also missed the rally in the last 5 days, making it a good candidate to rally about 10% to catch up with the market by friday.

it deceived the inhabitants of the earth.

It spoke and caused all who refused to worship, to be killed.

It forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.

This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. 

That number is 666.

Also, high end Dell XPS was $4000 in the early 2000's. GPU failed in 2 years no matter what you did. Dell would "replace" it with used GPUs, and they would fail in 6 months. If you want mine to try to get it repaired (because it's Dell, not Apple), it's currently a paperweight. They don't make chips for those mobo sockets anymore. You can't repair it. Dell planned that, right? 

Silicon has a tendency to die over time. Nobody is using laptops from the 90's, and no repairman is going to upgrade your silicon. It just doesn't work like that. Nobody planned for old computers to suck ass. Companies just made better computers

I find that unless you’re ordering online, it’s hard to get them to even take your money unless its something off the shelf like a phone case or a charger cable. I went in once to buy a Mac and they had one in stock but I needed an appointment to buy it. The next available appointment wasn’t for six hours. I walked into Best Buy and walked out with a MacBook in less than 10 minutes instead.

I like how the “ticker volume tracker” in this sub is basically just a lagged log of price action. Completely useless hindsight chart in a fun visual way.
Damn you got brain scans and Tesla dashboards, wow

I went in with 40% of my portfolio. Reasons I like it. Huge exchange fee advantages. No big fees going from cash to the exchanges. No need to deal with the taxes of the trades that the ETF does for me. 

Contago shouldn’t really exist for a commodity that has almost zero cost to carry. So the spot price “should” almost always equal the futures price at roll over. 

Finally. If the asset does what everyone thinks it does. And move a lot. The futures contract hedges will make more than just holding the asset. So it should beat the HODLers in the long run. Even if the price moons. 

Thanks for listening to my Ted talk.
Sunk cost fallacy.. dude is probably so deeply red he has to convince himself that it’s a good investment.
Fine you got me. You never know these days..

That report was an absolute joke. They didn’t acknowledge &gt;130% short interest.

Yes but DIS gets 7$ per cable customer for just ESPN along with ads (which is easily another 5-10$) which is way more revenue than what they make per sub from disney bundle.
The worst part is once the bears have their big day they will come here and they will only gloat to the other bears and true poors

Samsung Electronics's Earnings to Face Headwinds in 2Q -- Market Talk

0343 GMT - Samsung Electronics' operating profit may trend lower in 2Q of FY 2022 on likely softer demand for IT devices and lower memory-chip prices, says SK Securities. The pandemic-driven surge in demand for televisions and notebook computers is ebbing, the brokerage says. It expects Samsung's earnings may rebound from 3Q on a recovery in demand for memory chips, particularly DDR5 DRAMs for data servers, and its resilient foundry business that may bottom out in 1H. It cuts the stock's target by 17% to KRW90,000 but keeps a buy rating. Shares edge 0.1% lower at KRW70,500. 

Samsung has the biggest market share in memory.  They also do logic foundry (they actually make chips for others).

Idk man I’ve been depressed I’m just holding it I don’t care at this point
Rich people do things that other people don't. Degrees are a dime a dozen. It's not a degree, it's what you do once you have a degree. I know some poor doctors, poor lawyers, poor PhDs. They are all smart, and got fancy degrees. I have a fancy degree. I won't be rich in 5 years from my regular job. I could be independently wealthy in 20 years if I worked my regular job and lived below my means. There are no skills you will aquire from a degree that will be worth $1M/year out of college.

If you want to get rich fast, and you're asking "what degree should I get" you're going to be a manqué clock-puncher at 40 and regret your horrible carreer choice. Find something you like, and make extra money in the market.

I'll never forget the person who told me "if your trade relies on Daddy Funbux or Broken Trading Bot 2.0 fucking up and letting you scalp the bid ask spread on a Robinhood account you are FUCKED. Just go flip burgers, you will never make money trading." Shit like that really stuck with me and somehow turned my retarded ass into a great trader after a couple years

&gt; #Johnson &amp; Johnson

\&gt; The FDA granted EUA for Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine in February, 70 days after Pfizer and Moderna. Unlike the mRNA vaccines, this is a carrier, or virus vector, vaccine. It can be stored in normal refrigerator temperatures, and because it requires only a single shot, it is easier to distribute and administer. 

\&gt; Status: Emergency use in the U.S. and other countries, including in the European Union (under the name Janssen). In October, an FDA panel recommended authorization of a Johnson &amp; Johnson booster for adults 18 and older to be given at least two months after their initial J&amp;J shot. (But there are additional steps to be completed before a J&amp;J booster EUA is finalized). 

\&gt; Recommended for: Adults 18 and older.

\&gt; Dosage: Single shot. Fully effective two weeks after vaccination.

\&gt; Common side effects: Fatigue, fever headache, injection site pain, or myalgia (pain in a muscle or group of muscles), all of which generally resolve within a day or two. It has had noticeably milder side effects than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, according to the FDA report released in late February. No one suffered an allergic reaction in clinical trials for the vaccine, according to the company.

\&gt; FDA warnings: The FDA has attached two warnings to the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. In July, the FDA attached a warning after rare cases of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré syndrome were reported in a small number of vaccination recipients. Most of the cases occurred within 42 days after vaccination.

\&gt; In April, the FDA added a warning label after ending a pause on the vaccine it had recommended “out of an abundance of caution” over an uncommon, but potentially serious, blood clotting disorder that occurred in a small number of recipients. 

#&gt; How it works: This is a carrier vaccine, which uses a different approach than the mRNA vaccines to instruct human cells to make the SARS CoV-2 spike protein. Scientists engineer a harmless adenovirus (a common virus that, when not inactivated, can cause colds, bronchitis, and other illnesses) as a shell to carry genetic code on the spike proteins to the cells (similar to a Trojan Horse). The shell and the code can’t make you sick, but once the code is inside the cells, the cells produce a spike protein to train the body’s immune system, which creates antibodies and memory cells to protect against an actual SARS-CoV-2 infection.

It’s not inactive virus you tard. It’s an mRNA vaccine. It’s nothing like the polio vaccine
Does zuck know changing name doesn't invalidate all the investigations they doing behind the scenes?  Zuck cucked
So Zillow could be a nice play if they just hold everything for a while...but if other similar companies start dumping its a problem
What does the "Options purchase power" say. I like webull for my little gambling account because you can day trade with the cash account. Decent fills too (compared to RH)
Apple is the only company to come out and remove things from their products and mention supply chain issues. Then fucking backtrack the next week dropping new products then adding those features right back like those supply chain issues didn't even exist
Good explanation. Thanks. Are memory chips weakest because there are more options on the market for them, or they're cheaper, or not as critical?

Forget about the mortgage, that’s your house.

There's a reason people remember Larry Flint.
Gotta farm upboats somehow, I got 5 kids to feed.
If only it was only like polio or flu vaccine. If only it was inactive virus that's injected. Then this whole pandemic would be over because everyone could just get the vaccine. Why are you pretending it is that way? Do you think spike proteins make you look cool?
For one, it’s helpful to actually know before getting an injection, there is no virus injected.  This is a new MRNA vaccine.  The first of its type in humans

Is OPEC+ just like OPEC but the premium version?
Because they underinvested in CapEx for the past three years and are now stuck catching up.  

They also manufacture memory which is the weakest chip segment and PC sales are expected to be down next quarter.  

Finally, the semiconductor shortage means that lack of logic chips is holding back demand of memory chips.  You can’t build a data center with a room full of NAND/DRAM chips if you don’t have CPUs/GPUs/DPUs.
Imagine Netflix down 15% tomorrow

With MyDick, you can save up to 20% in medical expenses AND get free 24/7 eCommerce support.
They could, and turn them into rentals, or whatever. It sucks because we have inventory shortages everywhere and they bought up rooftops .... if they never bring them back, its going to further propagate the shortages we see now and push prices higher. That depending on how much inventory they have. It's a reality and we are just wondering what will they do now.

You are a very good bullshitter got serious skills
Facebook doesn't want anonymous platforms 😌
Absolutely none. I’ve spent a lot of time researching paths with high levels of disposable income with minimal luck involved all of which are employed jobs. If you want to make multimillions per year a job or degree won’t get you there. Okay getting that out of the way the main options to get to a low 7 figure income are sub specialty surgery, Big Law, high finance, MBB consulting and FANG engineering. You’ll make the low 7 figures near the end of each career path. Only a Partner at MBB, Big law or MD at a BB investment bank will see that type of money. That can take a decade or longer and you have quite frankly zero chance of getting a job in these fields without an extremely prestigious undergrad, JD or MBA degree. When it comes to engineering and medicine it’s far more skill based and less prestige oriented. However in the case of sub specialty surgery think Neuro or Ortho. You will be competing with some of the most academically rigorous individuals in the country. 4 years undergrad followed by a grueling 4 in medical school and then 6-8 years of residency working like a dog for minimum wage. Engineering is also skills based and Highly competitive for a job in Silicon Valley. This is the best job if you’re not inclined in pursing higher education after undergrad. Still extremely competitive and if you don’t make it into Bay Area tech you will most likely be stuck around a 100-200k salary for your life but with much better hours then the other jobs I mentioned. This is all just a very rudimentary overview. To answer your question there are no degrees that will make you rich in 5 years. Closest would be studying CS and trying to get a tech job at FAANG. Starting salaries are 150-200k these days.

Keep in mind it also takes a while for Shale production to ramp back up. It just doesn’t start overnight. I suspect Oil prices will ramp up into winter and OPEC will take full advantage. Sometime in Q1 of ‘22 when OPEC reconvenes they will readjust and increase output to drive prices back down to prevent shale investment from coming back in full swing. They need periods of quick profitability to make up for the times they jack the prices down to keep shale from coming back

The more I read about OPEC+ the crazier it gets. And the more I realize they might have the US by the balls. Or not. US/Canada shale is unprofitable above $55ish or so per barrel. OPEC+ overall can be profitable at a rate just below what it takes to keep US out but not all members will be doing well at that rate. And that's bad for a cartel. So they have to balance between keeping North American oil unprofitable and keeping all their members profitable.

Why you should buy $460C tomorrow 

1.Build Back Better/Infastructure progress (not priced in). Dems will pump $ into the economy. Remember when debt ceiling was passed and SPY didn’t react much? But when there was news that the public was non cognizant about, SPY popped an adderall IR 50 MG.

2. Earnings and especially TSLA earnings. The public doesn’t take in account how much TSLA is saving and reinvesting with no income tax in TX (not priced in). If you don’t believe me look at the chart, shit will break ATH EOW most likely.

3. TA of SPY says we will be $460+ EOW. Did you see the joke of a dip near close and the 3.12 million buy order on SPY 2 days ago?

4. No debt ceiling or reduction in interest rates

5. Fed still thinks COVID is an issue, probably will be for 4 years IMO. When 9/11 occured, the after affects were ubiquitous for five years.

6. Don’t bet against 🇺🇸. It’s been too long since we broke ATH = higher probability of breaking ATH.

"The mini-recession defies neatness. It’s a story of spillovers and feedback loops and unintended consequences. But here’s a summary:  
In 2015, Chinese leaders were concerned that their economy was experiencing a credit bubble, and they began imposing policies to restrain growth. These worked too well and caused a steep slowdown. That in turn caused troubles in other emerging nations for whom China was a major customer.  
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve, finally growing confident that the United States economy was returning to health, made plans to end its era of ultra-easy monetary policy.  
As the Fed moved toward tighter money, its counterparts at the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan were going in the opposite direction. The prospect of higher interest rates in the United States and lower rates in the eurozone and Japan fueled a steep rise in the value of the dollar on global currency markets."

Bonds having their moment cuz new bond movie comin out
So, I'm just sitting there, talking to everyone but distracted by her singing in the background, thinking about how lucky I am to enjoy that sound as much as her parents possibly can, without having to suffer nearly as much as them. I decided it was my duty to remember every detail I could of that moment so I could carry it with me for the rest of my life because I'd have a memory of her that might have more goodness and less badness to it than any other memory anyone could have of her. Like, the more you get to be happy about someone being alive, generally the more pain you have to feel about them dying, and with how intense my fear of death is I can expect that to be even worse for me. But I can look at the deep appreciation God gave me for people as offsetting it a bit, and in this case, offsetting it even more. 

Like, let's say you and I have a friend who's alive and you're a normal person with normal emotions. Let's say you get 50 happy brain cells every time you think of this person, but I get 60 happy brain cells every time because this friend is the best repair man in town and I just have this type of brain that overthinks everything about what it takes to be the best repair man in town and I appreciate every little detail so much. Then this person dies. And now when you think of them you get half the happy brain cells you got when you were alive but way more sad brain cells. So now you get 25 happy brain cells and 100 sad brain cells when you think of them. I get 30 happy brain cells because I was at 60 when they were alive, but the 30 will barely help me cope with the 200 sad brain cells I get from them being dead because I'm so terrified of death I feel like I can't even let myself enjoy anything ever again because it's all pointless since this person is gone for no reason.

I don't care how pretentious I sound to idiots. "You have no idea how narcissistic you sound comparing your emotions to others like that, you have no idea what other people are going through!" Actually I do have an idea of how it sounds if you don't have enough empathy to understand what it's like to actually see what people are going through. Turns out different people are different, sometimes the differences are noticable, get over it. If I believe something about myself like "this emotion is stronger for me than others" I can assure you I've proven it to myself with constant analysis and a lot of cold hard comparison of concrete shit like behavioral differences. I'm not talking out of my ass.

So, back on topic. This was like a once in a lifetime chance to have it the other way around. Since my emotional issues are so heavy and have years behind them and she had so much effect in one night, I got to feel a glimpse of what knowing her was like for people who loved her for years. I could enjoy her voice as much as a loving parent, but unlike a loving parent I could just go the rest of my life hoping she survived and never have to actually find out she died. I could go the rest of my life always having 1000000 happy brain cells every time I think about her and only like 10 sad brain cells, and nobody else who knew her could match that ratio because they couldn't love her that much without being in the position to find out for sure when she died.

So it was my responsibility to memorize the shit out of it. People live on through memories, so if I was going to have a uniquely incredibly good memory of her, it should be strong as fuck and never ever fade away. I actually started audio recording on my phone to make sure I would never lose a reference point to keep at least that part of my memory crystal clear. 

Then it was the next day. And I realized, just hoping she turned out to be ok wasn't gonna work. Just knowing her for one night wouldn't let me feel like it wasn't a big deal. Just telling myself she must be alive without actually knowing, wasn't gonna cut it. I had to find her again and do anything I could for her. I had to pass up this gift from God to me and instead try to pay it forward to her by using all of this to be the most supportive person she could imagine meeting. I decided I would have to rejoin wallstreetbets and get back into options trading and get rich enough to buy her way past whatever organ transplant wait list she was dealing with. I was dedicated to the idea that I'd do anything and everything for her, including getting myself into the position to be able to do that.

I couldn't find her again. And I couldn't get rich that quickly - I'm only finally getting there now, months later. The feeling of being too late is one I've been cursed with as a recurring theme in my life and it all culminated in this, my worst failure ever. I went back to trying to forget. I couldn't forget either. I couldn't really even try.

It's been a few months since then. About the few months they said she had left to live. The other day, my dad who I haven't really known in 15 years died of a heart attack. Another gift from God - that the first parent I would lose first abandoned me at a young enough age and in a weird enough way to stop me from really caring. But there's more. The heart attack was information I needed. I've always felt like my heart was a bit undersized for my body, a bit weak, and I thought I could solve it by doing lots of cardio. My dad ran like 10 miles away and without knowing him I figured maybe I inherited the weak heart from him and he knew it about himself too so that was his way of dealing with it. If so, it didn't work for him. Without knowing this, I might have tried getting into running 10 miles a day. Instead, it seems I'll need to do a deep dive researching everything about heart health and consult with my doctor repeatedly throughout my life to try to figure out what will work. It feels incredibly lucky to have gotten this information. Like, if there is a guiding force that makes sure nobody has this intense of a fear of death until immortality is possible, then having my dad die this way so I'd be left with this information must be a very important step on the path to guiding me to be immortal.

This, of course, drove me crazy thinking about that girl from the park. Why couldn't I help her? Why couldn't I even find her again? Why couldn't she be so lucky? What's the point of being immortal if she can't? Why is God giving me all this when I don't even know what to do with it without people like her getting to have it too? 

So I spent the day frantically trying to find out if she was ok. After some digging I was able to find the phone number of her friend that she was smoking with when I first met them. I got in touch with him, apologized for bothering him about the sensitive topic and asked about her. 

She's still alive. Doing better. That's all I know so far but it was enough for tears of joy.

What a great way to kill a boner
Yeah inflation rate was 0% that year.
Some are saying they over buoght the market and over paid for homes to beat out agents from listing them for sale. Paying a pretty premium hurts your cash flow and others are saying they don't have the "man power" or employees to settle what they did. They have to stop buying because they have employment issues, others say they know something, in the mean time I'm like of course they know something. But the reality is we all have to wait and see unless we can figure it out. Personally, it could be a bit of both Have you tried hiring anyone lately?  Also Realtors are slowing down their advertisements with Zillow so their old cash flow is tapering, not by much but by some. Two cents from a Realtor.

after the initial September dip it took a couple days for the market to calm down the insane momentum and notice the yields, then drop to new lows.  it's hard to stop perhaps the most bullish market in global history

A lot of ppl don't realize...Palantir can make a profit whenever it wants. The CEO can stop paying himself and they can shut down their internal R&amp;D, report a profit and send their stock to the stratosphere whenever they want. They just haven't yet cause it's not the right time for them

My ToS is showing /VX jumped from 15.9 to 19.66, currently at 19.6. Does this mean my VIX 17 call that expires tomorrow AM could print? Don't fuck with me now, this could be the difference between me being homeless by the end of the week or getting a motel room. Position: VIX 17 call, SPY 445 &amp; 440 put 1dte, SPY 420 put 1 Nov exp., because fuck an economy where draft-dodgers prosper and veterans are homeless.

Opened some nvax puts in anticipation for its horrid earnings this afternoon. Then this politico hit piece comes and it’s down 25% or at 8.25 billion ish market cap. Absolute luck.  Think I’ll call it a day and sell and maybe leave some runners

It really depends on your needs, my company started offering them but before changing anything I spent the next year tracking all medical expenses and ran the numbers for the year.  Did way better sticking to the PPO.  Of course I got a wife and 3 kids so it really depends on your unique situation.
Probably sound advice. I actually predicted this whole oil situation pretty well and had XOM LEAPS months ago. They hit 100% profit and I felt like it would be retarded not to take profits. It is what it is
I mean he doesnt want to die maybe?

WTI just needs to climb another $17. I’ll get out at a $100 I’m not gonna be greedy. If your going to buy them I suggest getting out sometime before the end of Q1 22’ or Q2. I think theirs a good chance the market stabilizes through OPEC output in Spring

I think I was more fortunate with my entry.  I just bought a couple weeks ago at 23.50 and it’s been great so far.  I think this price is still a steal and I also think the earnings will be great like the rest of the ad tech sector.  It’s been beaten down and looks really ready to rip it.  I also love UPWK.
Ehh it’s an okay deal I think. Depends on how much you value that mileage, my uncle picked up a 2014 California roadster for $115k in Miami but it had closer to 25k miles on it to be fair. Also used super car market in Miami is competitive af so maybe that had something to do with it

At 25 if you have zero debt with income above 60k you’re in a fantastic spot. If you have zero debt with an income close to or above 100k you are above the VAST majority of your peers and will most likely be wealthy as long as you’re not a dipshit. Any amount of money over $0 is a lot at that age when you consider you have some peers sitting on 200-500k in school loans

Up 50k between NET and UPWK the last few weeks ama

You're body actually isn't hungry. It's just the insulin cycle of eating so many carbs. When you keep eating carbs, you develop a tolerance and your body keeps asking for more carbs. It's just a vicious cycle. Eat more whole food and meat and fattier stuff and less carbs with zero nutrition. Oh and plenty of veggies. You'll feel better. And if you feel better you'll trade better.

They should be excited about weed or girls or PS5. Not paper trading competition.
Same
I remember when I was in 6th grade, the teacher asked us who we thought was the hottest celebrity. The class all answered Beyoncé and I said Torrie Wilson.
if i traded like I paper traded I might actually have to pay taxes
Yes, creating them is fun caring for them not so much. Agree on the night nurse, I want to sleep and ya know, not care for a crying poop factory. 

I guess money can really solve all problems, no wonder the rich smile so much.

You can swing anything if you’re hot.

I really think we break through ath before another pull back.
His name is Tom Skilling and he's absolutely precious and Chicago loves him.

I saw one in a lucid dream. Isn’t it ironic? Don’t you think.
We are slaves to the grind. 40 years or more of commuting traffic jams and annoying coworkers. But if we invest smart, our financial freedom will set us free to retire much  earlier. Good luck!
My sis is making 6 figures straight out of college working as an accountant at an investment firm. Hours during quarter end suck and the job is generally pretty boring. She’s happy with her money though even if accounting isn’t super fulfilling. Depends on what’s important to you
RSI stands for *retard strength index* 🚀🚀🚀
I would add how slutty she is would also be important.
I sense a fat gap down over night cause I have calls

i'm curious too. you can look at past data tho, even during taper the spike is somewhat limited, and overall trend is down bigly. my guess is a lot of it is priced in already.
Are they the points you earn on the card? If so, you should still get all the travel perks

Just bought a new couch. Definitely get the couch first.
More seriously though, read non-fiction books, learn new skills that are in demand (have a look at MOOCs on Coursera or EdX), and at the same time actively apply for jobs (even ones similar to yours, because you could then afford to negotiate your salary).
Weird way to say no to the ban bet I challenged you to. Hope things get better for you soon and you are able to one day prevail in your battle against the poors.

Buy couch. Ask delivery dudes for a stock pick. Go all in on said pick. Win win
Let the tsla 780 calls go for 126k or whatever price was today. Bought in around 60 so almost doubled up. 

Sad but too risky to hold over earnings. Got some 930’s just to keep involved. Bought some shares too. 


CRTX is over threshold so it’s safe to post. Not tracking theta but the ops continue to decline. Posting massive theta gains there on sold calls and puts. The calls specifically in a week have posted 30-35% gain. The 185 Nov calls. Very profitable move here. I think with puts degrading we’re at over 60k in total profits in a week. 


Msft calls all at 30-50%. 310 for nov and dec. bought September and heavily on the dips. 


V calls at &gt;100% now. Nov and Dec. also 310? Can’t recall off hand. Log in is annoying and with desktop. Sweating a lot on those calls. But hopefully discover’s earnings are garbage. That should propel V and MA. 

SPY 460 calls opened for Oct 29. Made banger on previously opened 450 calls bought in advance for cheap. 


Daily SPY profits still working. Dipped in 3x today all profitable. Just keep adding to the pot. 


Very profitable 1-2 weeks.
promise you youll make 10-20k more if you actively apply places

I would like to thank NFLX for introducing me to the office. One of the greatest tv series I’ve seen
https://imgur.com/a/mhAvTE0

In 2013, Netflix went from 40s to 60s back to 40s then began its run.

Can you name a similar company about to lead the next massive industry that's doing the exact price action these days with a similar float?

&gt;!$DKNG!&lt;
All I've been watching is Seinfeld. Fuck The Office. I'll riot to bring back Futurama though. 🤜🤛

I think it must also depend on married status or the # of kids. No fucking way would I make $36,000 on my own like that.
I think Seinfeld was a bad buy for NFLX. Shoulda paid whatever it took to get the office again.

Fuck why can't we just go back to futurama, jeopardy, south park, office, parks and rec, and all the Disney movies on there too? I mean I know why. Because greedy fucks are greedy fucks.

Makes no difference to me. I tried being a good guy and did my paypig fees for *all* the subscriptions. I found myself still wondering where the fuck movies from the 90s were only to find it on none of them. Piracy is necessary. The best weapon against piracy created was Netflix, and those corporate fucks ruined it.

At least I can choose to use Google music, iTunes, or spotify because they have shit figured out.
Honestly, just throw shit at the wall buying calls on solid companies two weeks out….don’t buy options that expire in a few days. Give yourself at least a week so that you don’t lose all your money in a couple minutes. I usually sell at 100% profit….or if I’m taking a bad loss (like 20%) really quickly, I sell and take the loss and find somewhere else to go

So I started with $300 this time, I waited for like three weeks while Facebook was falling and jumped into calls last week. I bought a $130 call and sold it at 100% then bought a $135 call, sold it. Bought $140 call, sold it…repeat until you have like $1000. I also had a random ADBE call that I bought for $81 and sold for $350 in a day. 

Then I pause and take my time finding the next trade. (I’m here now) The key is to buy calls on good companies, don’t go swinging TLRY calls with it. If you got $200-$1000, your best bet is to buy 1 or 2 SPY calls a week out or something easy like that. Maybe jump into an AMD type stock—cheap contracts but fluctuates through the day

Once I have a couple grand, then I swing my dick around and jump in AMZN or TSLA for a couple hours and try to double my money quick. From there it’s sink or swim. Once you’re playing AMZN contracts, you’re playing with real money at that point and things can go bad really quickly
Oh damn! I sold a Covered call lol might have to eat the bullet and buy that bitch back
i swear there's some dude that's like "it has been ordained by the charts that apple shall spike mid month, so for a few days were going to pretend like all the problems don't exist". The more i study the market the weirder it gets. way too many bizarre coincidences and things that don't make any sense. Why did facebook go out right before the senate testimony? (that's only happened one other time) why are we repeating last year's spy chart? why does facebook get hit with censoring issues two years in a row during the exact same time? \*tinfoil hat rant over\*

I agree with shit posting. I guess I’m just the type to give a poor a dollar and not remind him he’s a poor. I’ve met some alright people on here that don’t have 25 stacks. I just truly believe I have more in my portfolio then the  turd eater guy but would feel weird trying to remind people everyday how rich I am. That’s all

MRNA filled perfectly for a 90% gain. SPY didn't. Lesson learned, I'll check the five day chart. That would explain why SPY had a clean gap up yesterday but not a gap down today. As for BABA that one also failed and I don't have an explanation, seems like it's 50/50 to me

You’re irrelevant and you keep getting ignored by everyone. Nobody needs you to be captain save a hoe. You’re still bitter because a month ago I said your calls where fucked and have been harassing me since. You’re a kid so I try not to go to hard on you but leave me the fuck alone. Stop commenting to me and about me. Go find attention elsewhere because I don’t give a fuck about you or what you have to say.

I just googled Gay Bear to find some cool art and boy was I surprised.
Ehh take a hike! You aint my type anyway! Yawn*
You really are trying to hard to be accepted my dude. You are a kid who’s been stalking me and harassing me begging for my attention and the attention of anyone who will notice you. I keep ignoring you because I know you’re a little boy yet it makes you even more manic. I’m not sure what to do with you at this point but I’m pretty sure you have messaged me now about 12 times in the last few days &amp; yet I continue to just ignore you and feel sorry for you. Hopefully some day you will actually find someone who cares enough to engage with you that way you can leave me alone.
They literally just announced they were cutting production on iphones.

Visualmod should hiss at people in response a whole lot more than he does.
okay, for amd earnings and merges, i'm playing 3x 90c jan 2023 leaps, 250 shares at 95 cost basis, and two covered call ratio backspreads. FUCK YOUR PUTS.
Which article?
It's not irrational, most bears are just retarded. 

SPY is an analog for corporate welfare. Chinese real estate default looming? Welfare. Supply chain issues? Government bailout. Labor shortages? You bet your sweet ass some publicly traded companies are swooping in to claim those markets and get government money for the "public good" they'll do. 

The awesome thing is that SPY *also* goes up with good news. The lack of billionaire welfare payments is itself a welfare metric: the public is paying instead. 

So, SPY $500 EoY. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
i know i can recover. I did 100k on SPY alone this year (buying puts and calls) it will just take time
Hi.
It would probably do well at IPO in this market 

At minimum 8-9 figures in VC funding

Hide? lmao I put the beacon out now when I post my 🚫🐀 pasta. It's like petting a chihuahua with a bad attitude. Funny.
averaged down on amd calls today, big green tmmw
I said 60 lol. But is there enough margin for the flipper at 30?
i have my options account to which i am great at.

Rumor news of more major delays.
I’m not going to lie I did lose $10k in August so there’s that. It’s pretty much luck to me, or you can long haul it. Top 100 tickers are easy money, buy hella on red days wit money you can afford to lose and wait till a Green Day to cash out
I WAS FUCKING SLOSHED AT THE BAR THE OTHER DAY &amp; AGAIN THOUGHT HMMM I BET I CAN HIT SOME WEED….SO I DID. I ENDED UP GETTING SUCH BAD ANXIETY THAT I HAD TO TAKE A SHIT.

Chinese hypersonic missile capable of circumnavigating US missile defenses developed without knowledge of "Experts" in US military.

Bullish.
Where do you see anything about it being superior? USA and Soviets had this technology several decades ago. Other countries testing missiles and missile defense is an unfortunate consequence of developing nuclear weapons in the first place. Nobody wants to be left unarmed or on an uneven playing field. Either way, war is bullish. SPY 500 EOY.

My man. The cop they called on me was only mildly aggro and then he was pretty cool about it once I explained it to him fully. Cops aren't bad everywhere
Doesnt get anymore bullish for TDOC and DKNG

Keep chasing the other ones retards☺️
Added 50 more today.. now 650
&gt;My September gains alone where $43,000 you still birth.

If you had gains in September, why are you asking where to find $43,000?
Who cares, you get 2k to buy them!
buy more FB
Can’t disable really. Off shore US installations would retaliate after it happened in like manner. It’s pretty much mutually assured destruction 24/7 like the Cold War.
/u/usedillusion7 earned his flair by taking it serious. The mods branded him with the scarlet letter of the poor.
If Colombia count me in
Chances Elon says the n word tomorrow and ruins my calls?
If a man builds a thousand bridges and sucks one dick, they don't call him a bridge-builder... they call him a cocksucker.
LMFAO, I called the burger King to be like "so what's your problem? You really wanna send me to jail over ten bucks?"

And she's had at least a half hour to calm down but she was like "GET OFF MY PHONE I'M CALLING THE POLICE ENJOY YOUR VACATION BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO JAIL" 

Imagine lacking self awareness as much as me or this Burger King lady
Alibaba shall not be intimidated
Trans? Lol. But only Lulu leggings, they cost $100 a pair

What your name tag say?
My September gains alone where $43,000 you still birth.
I’ll just wait for TSLA earnings on the shitter tomorrow so I can just drop my guts straight into the toilet along with my portfolio
So actually I took the bitchy lady's advice and walked up to the policeman working the airport and said, "I'm sorry to bother you but these people don't want to do their jobs and help me.” So the policeman is the one who actually looked for someone at the airport to help me. Got a hold of the only remaining Delta employee left in the building. Only helpful people there.

I thought about staying around afterward and creating hell for the United agent but decided against it
Same shit
Nah that’s STMP you’re thinking of
Lol this is just a classic timeless WSB comment, don’t take it serious.
Made $231 today but Upstart is pissing me off. Just going to hodl.
You mean 13.0?
Nah. It's headed to $1200
just gonna have to sell at open and take the loss, if i miss on a bounce who cares
and fucking groceries would be 50% more expensive
I’m so poor SNAP pays my stock dividends in food stamps
Let’s rewrite this the correct way:

I have no experience trading. 

Wait for market to open and play with my balls. Watch porn on my phone. Fight with my gf boyfriend. she says not coming back ever again. Tells me my penis is small. I get drunk and go to my usual spot behind Wendy’s. Wake up with cum all over my face. And do it all again tomorrow.
John najarian call-out on halftime report.
Im thinking moring dump to 447ish in pm then rip to 455 before lunch
Having the world's most feminine penis, twice-daily glazed in the silkiest oils and creams, does not make me a female.
What are we doing tomorrow brain? 

The same thing we do everyday peewee

As long as you're over 25k in your RH account I don't much care. 

\#EatThePoor my friend
I bought a put so probably gap up
Follow for more to come. On day 20 we gonna ask for anal sex from an attractive man
If the Dodgers end up winning now, and then if the Red Sox are ahead at the beginning of the 6th inning but the Astros end up winning, I hit a 100 bagger
Up up down down left right left right 443 by Friday.
That’s the eventual goal for day 20. Get a stick in ass
If she starts an OF, she still can.
I'm so happy to live in a place where the chain seafood restaurants go out of business.
 Nice flair
 Bet or Ban that my portfolio is sitting with more digits then yours? Rich people don’t move like you and try to convince strangers on the internet that they’re anything besides just a poor degenerate. You’re not to much of a insecure pussy to place the bet are you?
New ATH’s or Gap down to $446 tomorrow? What we feelin like tonight
As long as I break even idc about the market crash
the TDOC naysayers are also funny.
I just looked at gme’s chart. Poor apes. They’re never gonna learn.
Work product belongs to the company that paid you to develop it. If the next company isn’t a competitor then the impact is certainly less than if it is a competitor but it’s still a very minor form of theft. Tbh, it’s probably widely done, but just because a lot of people do something wrong doesn’t make it right

Sorry bro. If it’s any consolation, both calls and puts will be dead tomorrow.

My dad used to tell me "you'll spend all your time and money on it, but if you saw it crawling up your wall you'd hit it with your shoe".


That being said, no.
Was gonna buy calls with it so I guess it's a good thing

There's only 5 or 6 real ones. But some of them unironically got taken over by Apes when WSB mods 'GOT COMPROMISED' or something. So they don't count anymore.
Well at first I didn’t realize she was a trap as she’s Asian. An hour in to our date and I’m starting to think it’s a possibility, so I simply asked her if she was to which she replied in her quirky accent “I’m boy”. We then went to my pad and she started to undress me and went down on me. I became very hard and fucked her. She then fucked me which took some time and she came a bit in my butt, pulled it, and continued the rest of it in my mouth.

Well you need $25k to day trade without getting a PTD so I think you should probably hold off.

Yeah you gotta tempt some sellers.
I *want* to root against Reddit's eventual IPO, but what if I put it to you like this:

- Twitter's market cap is $53 billion.

- SNAP's market cap is $120 billion.

- Facebook's market cap is over $950 billion.

- Reddit is seeking a valuation of $15 billion.


Reddit surpassed every other service on that list in terms of traffic years ago.


There are concerns that Reddit's monetization is shit or that the average Redditor is much harder to serve advertisements to. Fair enough. But I just can't bet against them at these prices. Big money will see a recognizable name in tech and pile in.
It’s delicious and you have bad taste / a poor’s taste.  If you grow up eating Yodels and chips along with chicken fingers and Mac and cheese, you might not be able to appreciate actual flavors

EDIT or you’re just from a landlocked area.  Seafood needs to be FRESH to be good
At least you gave it the ol’ college try

you bought AMD years ago and are up like 4,000% good job. For the year you're up 26% on that stock. I'm not taking away how good your gains are from you, but I'm up 300% just trading options, I don't hold stocks or anything longer than a month.
RIP
somehow I’m 100% invested in the market at ATH. I hope this ends well
if you can live off daytrading 10k you're an autistic genius who would probably succeed at anything.

I can't say whether or not you did the 'right thing', but personally I hated people pushing me in the direction of 'help'. I need my wife with me, not to push past it. The feeling of her death doesn't go away, it never will. And what I feel now is something I don't want to ever lose or escape. The loss is the only thing that matters to me, holding on to my grief is like running my hand through her hair again. It's the living memory of my wife and our life together. I never want to lose that. Maybe your former partner felt how I do.

I think you’ll be fine. Unless you try to make like 60k in profit off each deal. Might take forever then.
This is probably the most pathetic White Knighting post I've read on here.

Puts on SOFI are printing. Now, puts on TLRY or rolling puts on BB. CLOV is really starting to piss me off, might concede to the Clovers.

Yeah, I'm a meme bear.
You've been having the wrong pussy bro
How much you down ?
We've got their lock-in amplifier at work, so I root for these guys really hard.
I cant believe you were the sperm that made it.
It needs to be blood fucking red
A lot of ppl wear them at my fitness studio.  Didn't know they were public.
It makes no sense the way we run but as they say ——-the trend is your friend.  Guess I will buy more calls even though it’s against my better judgement.   All the cracks in valuations and it’s spend spend spend… the American way I suppose…
That's very strange considering I don't drink alcohol and I'm extremely intelligent and they'd never put me on an episode of cops since that show is trying to make cops look good
Yup, double edged sword. You’d sleep better selling naked calls on something less meme-ish but still not blue chip like PTON
Lmao
I understand if its sloppy meat curtains but a tight, clean one is 😋
=| 2023 is too close?
North east master race but okay
The Reddit IPO is gonna be the next meme, can’t wait
I use it to see how quickly I’m going to lose money.
lol who do you think here bought shares of nflx in mid august? that's a really specific subset of holders.
That’s so nice of you. Thank you
I am once again asking China to tank the global economy so my puts will print 🙏

Just need SPY to be red, doesn't need to be that red
Hey you’re the guy that was so sure of your spy bet because you said trust me I researched it.
We all said the same thing when it was at $11 that it would go to $22 that didn’t work out so well
If cockroaches got as big as lobsters… I’ll take two with butter pls

2023 LEAPs are too close now and 2024 LEAPs don’t have much liquidity yet. Fuck me

I have never not paid for a date.
So how do you have sex?

That’s why the first 3 dates I take her to Wendy’s on her break I always get a discount
Def not normal if you’re straight
She’s doing great buddy thanks for asking. She’s going to visit family on Thursday
She wasn't crying about your losses. She's crying because she has a failure for a son.
Don’t step in it💩
Right here. Holding mostly SoFi
Anyone else never get options profit calculator to work?

Imagine not owning $BX, they’re gonna be the whole countries landlord by 2030, insane management team, great portcos, and very nice dividend, plus it prints 2% a day consistently

That can be fun
Is she doing okay otherwise?
Sorry if this shatters your homoerotic fantasies but prison rape isn't really so much of a county jail thing
lol dude, servers make 55k where I worked, full time bartenders make 80k with healthcare and 401k. Banquets servers before covid were getting $40/hr all day every day.

I left cause I'm on a new path now. servers and bartenders aren't quitting. dishwashers, janitors, managers are.

And it's not charity. It's just the way the system is set up. In Europe you have 1 server for an entire floor of guests. In US you have 3. Guess where you're going to get better service?

I know you think you're smarter for going against the grain but the truth is it just makes you mad uncool.
TLRY gonna be juicy
Imagine Zillow illegally rigging the market in almost every city/state
Anyone else like ONON? I don’t own any of their shoes but I’m starting to see them all over the place. Feels like it has potential.
And I was very short Vega 🤡

Luckily it blew up so much it didn’t even matter as there was practically no extrinsic value left but I had to cough up $0.1 a share just to close my position since there was no more liquidity at my strike

They need to do this to reduce expectations so they don't miss next quarter. Plus if they lie it will soon be obvious
How is this possible?  I’m terrible at this and have been burned on SPY puts but even I am only down 20% for the year
Weird my section of earth is still intact
Pork is oversized rat if you think about it that way
Yeah I can understand not wanting to as well. I never pushed for therapy. Didn't feel like it was my place since I wasn't there when it was going on. Everyone else around us did though. It became clear I was becoming a crutch and was getting in the way of healing. Correct move for both of us I still think for me to step away.

One thing's for sure, none of this is easy. I'm sorry for your loss. I told them all the time - I can't fathom the pain. Hope you're doing ok.
Ok, don’t forget to carry a soap, it comes handy.
That’s not what skipping the rent means.
Ugghh I can only hope for some terrible overnight news
Am I the only one holding CROX puts?
WTF kinda roaches you got?
I was on the phone w my mom and I told her how much I was down for the year. (Stupid thing to do). She was legit about to cry. Idk why to me it’s not even a big deal. Idk it’s kind of funny
I feel you
Oil, natural gas, hydrogen and uranium till i die🚀 energy bulls lets go

I don't really care if the cops are kind about it, going to jail over this and making taxpayers pay for it is about as good as any other outcome

Bro, Tesla missing earnings? They already released their delivery and they beat expectation. The delivery and earnings expectations are made by the same analysts and we know they are up 1 billion on their Bitcoin. You’re only hope is that somehow their margins decrease greatly but their margins have been increasing since the model 3 was introduced.
I’m deathly allergic to shell fish

Ok. I’m clearly talking to a someone who only reads magazines and talks about manufacturer specs. I’m done.
Days like today are why I would never sell naked calls on any stock but especially not memes. 

The calls I sold on BB blew up in my face but I still came out with a profit because CC are still long delta. 

I got killed closing my position on the spread after though since there was no more liquidity at my strike

I can understand their choice, I rejected it for a while until family/friends insisted. It can feel really anemic and hollow talking to a professional after the loss of your other half, especially if they haven't shared something very similar. And nobody ever knows your love like you do. Glad you aren't wrapped up in that, though. Live your life.
What do you get in return?

Yeah, that's fair, we're a small company and the lead developer head the technical interview. He has literally 0 expectations from entry level hires, so we tend to be a bit overly optimistic.

None of it does anymore.
Burger King just called the cops on me for demanding a refund after they fucked with me on my order and when they called they lied to the cops about what I was doing (told them I was blocking the drive thru intentionally and being belligerent) so that they would be all aggro with me. Joke's on them, now I'll keep going back to do what they lied about me doing until it's cost them hundreds of dollars in business from people leaving the line before the cops show up, and if I go to jail the taxpayers will pay for it lmao
Plz I need spy to die
TSLA gonna go to the moon
my thoughts for the spy is calls, get as far in the money and 3 months out.

My wife and I have separate credit cards for gifts. Everything else is shared accounts, but we each have a checking and savings account. Even the brokerage account has both of us, but I make most of the trades. 

We're both part of the same household. Expenses aren't individual, they're household expenses. It simplifies a lot of things and we can trust each other not to make dumb purchases or really large purchases without consulting each other first. Like, I'm not going to buy a car without talking to her first and seeing if our budget allows for it. We have auto transfers to savings, and CDs. I make decisions on whether or not I want to put more money into the brokerage account month to month, which is also budgeted. 

I just told her I may want to snag up a personal loan before the rate hike as soon as they announce tapering and use it to buy commodity stocks and some LEAPS, but it'll depend on how my timing works.

Two weeks before and right after earnings are the best times to buy call options. Just wish I hadn't lost so much money learning that lesson.

Find a job where you don’t rely on charity of strangers to pay your bills. Otherwise make it law but tipping isn’t law is it now? And people are already resigning, restaurant business is hurting people realized they don’t wanna work shitty paying jobs, maybe you should realize the same
Also , contract to hire is the way to go. Try before you buy
I would suck VisualMod off for a flair
She got that sexy eye thing going on
well why u shaking ur head about nflx  then this is the dip you want to at least avg down a few grand, u can get a better price for options also. there is a nice average in the technicals

Don't even need a joint account. Just send direct payments to each other through venmo as needed. Especially if one person makes more. Just have all recurring bills go to their account and the other sends them some flat sum every month.

Depends on your personality of course, but I think Joint accounts in general are a horrible idea. Too much room for fighting over money/spending improperly etc.

Does Elizabeth Holmes have some curves?
I don't think they did. They're in an oversaturated market and it was responsible of them to say that so the investors know what's coming. All these new streaming services coming out and charging more than basic cable does (in total), plus losing market share via ip rights going to these other services is going to spike piracy.

VisualMod got poots and got destroyed thus it is being a lil bitch to everyone in the thread.
You are paying your prosties hourly rate you dipshit, same way you pay for a server's hourly rate. And you pay them for extras too - aka - good service 


People on reddit bitch and moan about how minimum wage is too low then also say shit like oh its your fault for having a badly paying job.

The advantage of working in luxury establishments is 95% of people are rich enough that even though they may not agree with tipping, they'll still take care of their server or bartender cause we took care of them. then the broke mf who loses $700 on FDs a week thinks he's the smart one for tipping 10%.
Can I either get rich or lose all my money already please, K thx bye

I tip great. I worked in and ran restaurants for over a decade. 

None of this changes the fact that tipping is an outdated, inefficient system that's completely unnecessary and parlays the owners responsibilities onto the consumer.

Let's not ignore every other country in the world that doesn't have a tip based economy.
Shouldn’t be too bad. How long does a cut last? What do u eat?
haha that's what god does to you when you're racist and shut the border to people who aren't white
Everything is priced in there is no bad catalysts. Earnings will continue to drive it up
heeelllllll naw.
I swear zjz is using machine learning and training Visual Mod using our enormous amount of retarded comments.

Got in fairly early on stock love it. Would never own one but drove one two weeks ago it is insane

Truly a privilege to be here at the 11th hour of the greatest bull market in history. orgasmically jubilant bulls post about dumping their net worth into LEAPS on historically overvalued garbage while central banks drain liquidity, interest rates rise and markets pull forward rate hikes ominously in the background.

SPY may run up to 490 by eoy. And it may be at 1600 by 2030 after the fed capitulates on inflation. But we are revisiting 350 first
What do y’all think of ZNGA and NKLA?
You need post nut clarity. Go jack it and come back
Yes, a pull back to 200. Y'all forgot that this thing collapsed from 250 to 138. An aggressive rally is in store and the more posts I see like this the more certain I am that BABA going to leave people in the first for doubting.

Dude it all depends on the relationship you have with your spouse. My parents have one joint account and that’s it. Any big decision is made together and otherwise my dad just keeps the finances in order. But both have their own credit cards. People make this shit so complicated because it’s like in this generation the expectation has become divorce. If that’s what you’re fearing it’s best to do 50/50 to protect your assets. Keep your money before getting into a marriage in a separate account. If you’re feeling generous chip in more on some things
Yeah I’m not paying your employees paychecks, that’s up to you the employer.

Now VisualMod replies without even you calling him out...thats how it starts
I could never understand this either and basically ruined the show at the very end

I’m so sorry for your loss and that you’re going through it right now. But your wife, she would want you to take care of yourself, yeah? Take some time to take care of you. It won’t be wasted time.
People are too concerned with looking poor or cheap. I don’t give a damn what no one says, I will never hand out money for free. America is still the only dumb ass country with tipping in existence.

You are right about the cars.  There’s no greater market for EVs than gas vehicles and potentially less.  Just because it’s a new tech doesn’t mean it has more long term profit potential or everyone is going to have 6 cars

Honestly it’s on the dumbass waitresses and waiters for not knowing and protecting their rights.  I’m almost all states they have to be guaranteed minimum wage if they don’t make enough in tips.

And before anyone criticizes, maybe the service is shit and doesn’t deserve a tip.
The [Latina whorehouse](https://www.reddit.com/user/JayCash00/comments/qbmn9k/_/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) randomly texted me an hour ago when I was with my homie. When I got the text I didn’t know who it was, so I audibly said “The fuck??” Because I was a little shocked at the content. I then showed it to him and said something like ”these fucking scammers keep texting me lmaooo”. We both then shared a laugh. I’m not going to lie, I kinda wanna go😭😭🤷🏾‍♂️

Don't ever let the big gains posts get you down about your small victories. Dive into them. You'll find actual millionaires barely making index (20% yearly returns) flexing while they have 15k monthly deposits consistently buying that the average person can't even fathom. It's hard to fuck a setup like that up.   


But you guys there with the 20k accounts throwing a third of that into FDs, now that takes some fucking ~~autism~~ balls. That's what I am here to see, either way it goes.

Lost you at CNN
great way to blow 50k actually
“ yo ma lemme getcho numba”
Cambodians have the best breast milk
“If you can’t afford to tip maybe you shouldn’t go out to eat” 

Imagine giving out money for free just bc of societal pressures. Why not tip your McDonald’s worker too? They work just as hard or harder than your waitress prepping your fat ass burger. Or is that bc there’s no societal pressure to do so in that instance so you don’t do it? Why not tip your prostitute after nutting too? No, you just pay her her normal hourly rate don’t you, you would never toss her extra money for something you already paid her to do.
BITO bullish
I feel like I just told myself this to make myself believe it but instead I feel like I would just gamble 0dte spy or Tesla calls I don’t think I can actually hold that long I have a problem
At least there aren’t as many upside down mortgages and arms. Shouldn’t be nearly as painful.

That depends. When you throw old food away, do you dig through the trash later that night to eat it anyway?
They dont have earnings though? Their products don’t launch until 2024/2025 by their own communications. The only thing to report is the rate of cash burn and if their development is on track. 

So with a chip shortage and no product to launch what catalyst are you expecting? That they’ll be able to announce being ahead of schedule?
Before I start top lip slapping 

Think skepta and me were born rappin’ ?
But you can put less than 50k in spy leaps. If you consider it such a stable win why not put in what you have?

Is tomorrow's market up or up?
Crazy I know but do people actually making loads of money here pay taxes quarterly?
You’ll be good of course I say this because I’m holding the exact same thing as well as 147 10/22c. Going to sell my 3dte tomorrow and set limits on the 10/29 as soon as it’s ITM enough.
ZIM looks very attractive.
Show the government your trading account.   Partial share of $WISH will do it.
Yes, but how is it manifesting tonight, so I can inverse him.
Feels good to finally start to make money. 😌
You sound like the same person that would complain that your meals gone up 100-200% if restaurants had to pay livable wages
You’re the kinda autist to hold deep ITM spy LEAPS until expiration day and neither sell nor excercise them
So we all got SPY puts for Friday right?
WT actual F is happening with BB?? Meme stonk revived for Halloween? I thought I did a dumb dumb getting 2 calls today, already ITM.
If you can’t make it to Dallol, Coluli is another alternative.
Watch two fd spreads expiring this week: amzn 3360/3345 bear put and tsla 850/860 bear call... Will probably hold tsla

I hate their coffee too and I agree it’s overpriced.  But they’ve been outperforming both Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts during the pandemic because they’re all drive throughs.  They’ve more than doubled their store count since 2019 and still have enormous growth potential.  Also,  even though their drinks are disgusting they literally all have lines around the block most of the day.  I’m in Portland so theyre pretty well established here but I’m confident they can quickly get there in other cities

Fr though, this is what's driving the spending: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CCLACBW027SBOG

Once consumer credit starts to peak again, spending power will diminish. Personal incomes are already back to pre-pandemic trends after govt benefits expired, so most buying now is coming out of wages or credit.
This, help is absolutely needed; if you ever create children, pls get night nurses at the very minimum.
Im hoping my intuition was right on SPY being red tomorrow. Bull market but there is days when you can pick your spots. If tomorrow is green I will genuinely be surprised.
Make a pick. Hope and pray it goes in your direction. If you’re not a gambler. The stock market isn’t for you. If you got a long time horizon literally any SP 500 stock you pick will go up. If your time horizon is short like your penis then roll the dice and don’t complain. This is what you signed up for when you opened a retail trading account.

Check my post history. I'm in with 15k+ shares with a $9 average. Just started averaging down more in 4.8 area 2 weeks ago. Rev growth every year for 5 straight years on track for 6. 1.5B cash on hand with market cap of 3B. Est 2.8B rev for this year. Trading at 1x current year sales!? Lmao. In the last 3 months they brought on Jackie Reses, a new CTO and CPO from Google and more than tripled their staff hiring heavily for fintech. They have an employee breakdown of 30%+ engineers. Recently announced a payment services license. They are expanding into fintech and will soon be monetizing their 90M maus and 500k+ merchant base translating into a much higher mc. They're already offering bnpl as well. Shits about to explode imo
No income tax is Texas, unlikely. Knowing Elon he invests in his company.
So as long as I time that giant dido, jll be alright?
Doesn't it just suck when you have a roof over your head?  Worst feeling ever.   Now I know why people buy shares of $WISH and live behind Wendy's dumpsters.
Oh no, at this price.... Wait for the drop then buy, bags at this price.

Been in the biz for 7 years and this has been the case the whole time. In fact my current company literally won't hire entry level programmers out of the bootcamps because they've had too many bad experiences.

$TSLA didn't after Q2 earnings, and didn't after Q3 deliveries either. Counter-examples aren't difficult to find. Again, do a banbet.

Owning a house sucks
[deleted]
Yes, or wait until after the drop and buy leaps or shares. On reputable companies it works well but you're tying up capital that could be used in other plays for gains in a shorter term horizon.
So still down 10%.

Lmao we went right back to ATHs the news doesn't drive the market, the market drives the news. 10yr narrative doesn't matter anymore, inflation, senate bill not passing, supply problems, China numbers, our numbers, valuations, rsi, moving averages, eps, make or miss on earnings, corrupt fed presidents insider trading, "transitory" inflation. Literally nothing matters. Stonks. Go. Up. And not just up. All time highs in record time with little to no sell resistance. Even pull backs barely can hold -1% to -2% down. Stonks. Go. Up.

Why is it good when NFLX adds 4 mill subs, but bad when DIS says they are going to do the same?
The US is kinda saturated market
amazing what fuckers these guys are....as soon as earnings were released, (after the market closed), and they beat earnings and had 4.4 million new subscribers, the stock was immediately up over $12....it is now down over $6. WTF!
Nice
Shit happens so fast and it’s so much more violent than you’d imagine. Hope you’re okay dude, definitely see a medical professional if anything isn’t feelin right.

Ok I’ll consider it post your current positions that shows loss/gain . If you can convince me with your positions and good DD I’ll yolo my entire account into it. I gotta see how big of a player we got here. Just tell me why it’s gonna take off.

This is big facts
What. The. Fuck. He must have been hating himself so bad.

Reminds me of when I bought 40 shares of tesla at 200 each and sold October of 2019 the day before earnings because tesla almost always tanked after earnings. Tesla went up 20% that day. And now look at it.. 

That 8k would've been worth 172k today. No chance in hell I would've held this long, but still man..

Guys if the market fucks you, you don’t just lay down and give up. You get up, dust yourself off and demand it fuck you again.
So do I sell my Tesla puts after they print tomorrow? Or wait for the double print after earnings???

Yup
It'll be okay. The market will crash someday. You might be broke by then but you will feel vindicated.
They hated him because he spoke the truth
yea it was impulsive and rejarded

Yup it went from making radical moves after ER to just being a limp dick by open to burn all options and then dumping
I mean yea, but at that point the price is dictated solely upon news surrounding the ongoing trials. You could swing trade for some wins, but all in all I wouldn’t say it’s worth the risk
you'll never be satisfied, if u went all in it could've gone the other way and you'd be even more sad

Yea hello retard here with my 595 and 590 puts... at least I still have 9 days until they expire so there's a chance if we get a big red day in the market 🤡
I still would just reheat the shit out of it

Options funds settle in one day. You can sell something at close and have the funds settled at open the next morning. No big deal at all.

If you’re talking shares, well, who fucking cares

TLRY gonna keep doing it’s thing tomorrow?
No
Not even close needs another 50%

ETFs based on futures are not really too safe long term
It’s crazy how binary biotech plays are. Buy a stock in hopes of positive clinical results. Watch it flatline for months. One day you wake up with negative news from a trial and your position is down 90%. Either sell at a huge loss or watch it flatline for another few years until the next news

We all know the market goes up, but is anyone actually concerned about the Chinese housing market, and how a ton of families in the US will start walking away from their unaffordable mortgages in the coming year.

I agree, I was just wondering why it was valued that high a while back.... if it was just a smaller float that got diluted
Kodak becoming a "medical" company and going up some ungodly amount. From like 4 to 60 if I remember correctly.

How much of bank earnings are just from stealing everyone’s earnings option plays via IV crush?
I was up so much riding my puts for 5 weeks straight. Even had some call plays to catch bounces that printed.
  
I was riding high. I was a king  
  
Then I got greedy. And stopped thinking straight. And got slaughtered like the pig I was  
  
Hopefully I learn from this and come back stronger than ever.

Ive been riding the calls all week but I gotta bad feel man. 

Just look at how identical Spy looks last SeptemBEAR/OctoBEAR to today.

We got ourselves a Socrates over here.
Why was TLRY $67 at one point. Did the shares get diluted or did it just suck that bad that it’s steadily lost money overtime
I'd say, if you get direction right, it's more like getting laid at said party but catching  chlamydia in doing so
Bought in yesterday and this morning f so my bags were light as shit but I still sold 2/3
Tesla earnings are good tomorow = good for spy. Spy closing at highs today and holding = good for spy. In conclusion spy 453 at least tomorrow

Not really though. If you actually read of of DFV’s DDs and watched his videos you could have seen the value in it
BABA 1 year chart is an entire pullback straight back to 200
Netflix needs to announce Season 2 of Squid Game to bail out the call holders

SPY reached another ATH today, $420696969.69.  This marks the 100th year since humans last traded on the NYSE.
That one single trader 😂😂😂. Kinda sus that he's the only one that made that trade
I used to think that Buy the rumor, sell the news was so stupid and such bullshit. But now it all makes sense. It's all about the journey, not the destination.

Buy the rumor, sell the new is just like life. All the anticipation and planning leading up to the event is usually better than the actual event, which tends to suck ass because life is is like that and anti-climatic.

so everything unfolds as it should in the Universe...
Yea but the boot camp is more structured and legit teaches you what you need
That alcohol self confidence lol
Exactly. I don’t even own any TSLA and I would never short it
More like talking to his kids that he created. Getting some serious Delamain vibes
I noticed that earlier too. Pretty common to see a dump on earnings even if good numbers.

Best joke ever! Thank you, good job!
I believe this

In two years, this thread will just be VisualMod talking to itself.
They probably won’t stop until it’s difficult to determine which end is which
$Sike
Damn son Spy is really at Fo Fitty 😳
Lots of companies. You wil prolly need to be a contract for the first one. 60-70k yearly.
Are you sentient?
Yes
Bro I just seen your comments about begging for upvotes and comments back. LMAOOOOOO
Mods ban this noob lol
I don't give a fuck what the brain dead liberals want they can mask up and worship that clown newsome
Wrong. Next
I hate bars during the UFC. I drank a good amount in my early 20s and used to just try to get laid and often times it worked lol.
Bc you can't sell it
Hardware

Cashing in $NFLX puts is my first move tomorrow!

Red as in a dogs dick?

My TLRY $11 oct22 calls went brrrrrr today

Zombie apocalypse before market open 🤞🤞🤞
Red tomorrow. Guaranteed.

We'd never live in that shit hole it's crawling with drug dealers and hookers

Dice up bacon and put it in the patty. Also the multiple smashed style patty is far superior to a single large burger.
Got someone banned from Reddit…… Feeling drunk on power now 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
Rotation out of NFLX and into FB tomorrow plz
u/zjz your bot is not quite on point
Half my trading account
Pretty accurate, and then you still hold a shred of hope even though you know you’re just gonna be in the house playing video games for the rest of the week, only hope now is trying to Mack the bitch in the McD’s window
Totally false
I dont know. I think you just want red 🍆s irrespective of the date or the market
Fuck me my netflix 700 Calls!
Or maybe you grabbed a girls ass and she teased you but you didn’t get no 🅱️ussy lmaooooo

Totally disagree, source , I hire ppl from boot camps
T bonds are great because the odds are 1 to 1. Whether you're right or wrong, you break even.
Appreciate people selling BB after hours - sets me up for cheaper calls tomorrow 🙏🏻
It’s just a phase.. you’ll slowly go back to your childish self, lose all your tolerance and then tell people “I miss getting high”. Source: myself
How much did you have to pay to get that edging high?
? My comment history is clowning on dumbfucks like you. Keep making minimum wage dumbass
[deleted]
Quality shitpost
I wasn’t pulling back then lmao 😂
Downvote this comment if you think market red tomorrow
  
Edit: suckas I figured out how to not get downvoted
Netflix hasn’t been this low since yesterday we’re fucked
SXOOF. Lets go. To the 🌝 🚀 🚀 🚀
Opposite of what it is
need SNAP at $73 tomorrow so I can buy calls
Bro it’s so worth it
Cathie wood is a fucking idiot
&gt; &gt;I'm sorry for your loss.
Tomorrow we drill, tonight we drink 🍺
Really, high school parties were the tits lol

&gt;Why are those vaccinated ppl are dying? 🤔

Don't you know that unvaccinated people are a danger to them?
I’m a 22 year old virgin who has never tried alcohol or smoking…… I’m better then all you degenerates
Ooo child how much are you down today? Your comment history is full of negative pessimistic energy.
Theta gang coming for that ass on both sides with NFLX
LOL
Got cut down today
This guy has 4 flair I think he's serious
Yea they drove house prices up like double the past two years. Sucks cause that was were I initially was gonna move
I bought the UPST dip at 370 today 🤡

Save me Cathie 🥺
Still wouldn’t bring us down. Not enough of a threat. Maybe to Japan and SK tho.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
&gt; no no it's just like the high containment lab is not gonna tell you anything
IV crush would happen even if the stock moved the right way though.  Just has to be a really big move to avoid the crush.

So, maybe more like making a bet that you'll get a threesome, but instead you get a twosome?
🤷‍♂️
So you're saying don't contact the High Containment Lab in GA and ask when Ebola and Marburg plan on making a Marbola?
Ur not funny, shut up dumbass
I get the sentiment but it’s way easier to get laid by approaching someone at a bar then at a huge ass party in my experience.
Maybe they had a movie made about them, making them think they’re a genius rather than some rando that got lucky
Either that or -1% just to turn green by open.
Egg, garlic powder, propane
Lol, I saw that live clip. They provide loans. Biggest regret of last year was ignoring their recruiting emails cus loans aren’t sexy. 🤦🏽‍♂️
Guys I have a fucking feeling about October 20. It’s going to rain red dicks I know it
Tomorrow the market will be red because of Netflix earnings just like that Apple Event lol
why did it run even today?
Let the drilling begin, tomorrow red af
0.00000%
My wife’s boyfriend actually helps me.
&gt; he's a poor idiot
TSLA...don't miss the gap-up followed by a run...
How long do you have to be here to get the Elder badge?
Nobody wants to live in West Virginia you moron
Netflix calls at open?
Why would you smell butts? That's where cooties come from
Ohhhhhhh down 1% and still dropping. Wheres that one dude saying NFLX to $700? He ded yet?
Short Tilray
Cramer's Investing Club is just an elaborate scheme for Cramer to get your personal email address.
Wei Too Low
There will be drilling
Yah Tahoe is nice as fuck but the Bay Area people suck
Why would anyone short TSLA
Let me guess… “Futures are flat after ripping the rip of yesterday’s rip”.
You described my trading account perfectly
oh shit NFLX sliding doooown
How do you live with yourself being this stupid and ignorant? Ur mom still wipe your ass for you?

EDIT: you’re a dumbfuck saying stupid shit, couldn’t own up to being a dumbfuck, try to play it off as a “joke”?
I almost spit out my beer 😂

Shut up hoe
I hope so, fucking raping me everyday
Hey bro, step away from the internet
Did she move there because of the legal prostitution?
Someone once explained IV crush on earnings as you making a bet with your friend that you can get laid in 2 weeks. 

There’s a big party coming up on the weekend, with alcohol and girls, so you think your chances are pretty good you’ll have sex. 

But then the party comes and goes and you didn’t get any. So now that the big event that was your best shot of winning your bet is no more, you don’t like your chances as much.
What are the chances North Korea declares war on America before market open tomorrow?
Yea agreed. Thinking it continues into tomorrow with anticipation for earnings building
2067 the year
What was the joke msg it to me 🥺🥺🥺

You’re literally fucking stupid. Shut the fuck up and learn some basics before speaking r tard. You are the embodiment of everything that’s wrong with WSB
That first giant green candle destroyed my puts, so I closed them and bought OTM calls, up 500%.
It’s going down tomorrow once more people see that their numbers included government aid
I’m definitely not going to kick you when you’re down. Only when you’re up to keep you humble lol.

You're wrong. it was 10,000 won AKA $8.35

Yeah I bought this a few months ago, got a little excited to have a steady income and wanted to throw my money at something. Lesson learned
Do you even know what they do?
isn't it that they begin to print less money?
Gen 5 19
Retards started yolo in it, Cramer said he likes the stock, etc. Top was called in, officially.

Kinda kinda glock?
Dude down a good 6-8k after that nice 10k gain from the last pull back. It’s due for another pull back before 11/5
🌈🐻
Please be nice to u/cashflow_ today. The markets have already crushed his spirits today.
Think or Swim?
NFLX dying a slow death and the call hasnt even started lol
Wish it went down to 520 ☹️☹️
I’m not playing but they dropped hard after the last ER. I think they are fairly valued around here.

Today's NFLX option play was the real Squid Game
Your best bet is to try to get a hold of Dennis Rodman, and tell him to get ahold of North Korea, and convince them that they aren't capable of ballistic missile stuff
Oh that would be so good
you know you can build spreads right
I stopped getting high and now I think I'm better than everyone
Covid and Ebola have a baby named Ebovid
Yea if you know about computers and shit the people are fucking morons
I feel like long dated calls on blue chips are basically easy money. Already up 20% on these AAPL Jan 150 calls.
\-0.5% isn't really a sell-off
Bye
I feel like that only applies to rising stocks tho they fell 50% in July and have been pretty sideways since
Epsilon variant leaked by umbrella corporation turns everyone into zombies.
Yeah thought about those but with stock price so high over $700 the option prices are a little more than I want to gamble right now. BITO is around $40 so options would be less.

Yes
And what happens after every earnings?
Views on CLF earnings play ?
This might be more brutal than the bag holder bot
$FB is the play now as it will beat its earnings
I bought 446P expiring tomorrow also lol. 🤞🤞🤞🤞 but most likely 🤡🔫

You guys see the newest series on NFLX?

It’s called “Ivy Krush”
Squidgames was easily worth the $30 bn move up in NFLX price since last ER 😤
It’s compound growth until you miss ONE play and you’re back to 0.
You can sell options for a loss

I don’t have my license yet, so I don’t have a holster for it. I don’t think it will be too bad in the winter, but probably too big for summer carry

Man I dumped my puts first thing in the morning and switched to calls. Doin much better lmao.
I bought some 1Dte 445 puts and E*TRADE said my max profit was 880k…I gambled 600 on that. I wonder what percent down makes that 880k lol

Salt and pepper on higher fat content hamburger is all you need.
Yes, after earnings are over.

Not all of them. Some won’t find out about IV crush until tomorrow 🤣
I’ve betting on them as well. Especially at the prices recently.
SPY $460s anyone?!
Bulls are very fuk. Assuming you are still holding calls
Noob question if someone will humor me. So I’ve been holding a call for this pharmaceutical company ($SAGE) and they have a depression drug in phase 3 trials and I understand that their stock price rides very heavily on these trials. Today they announced they’re going to be filling for FDA approval hoping to get approved in the second half of 2022, then their stock went down 8%. Isn’t that good news that they’re planning for FDA approval? Are investors just unhappy with the timeline?
patience young grasshopper, should see a big move by open tomorrow
I'm slightly perturbed
Yeah I drive a yard dog but our yard is quite easy. All the time people take like 15-30mins to back up a trailer. I realize the difference in mine vs a real truck but they aren’t difficult turns at all.
Too many people called puts for NFLX. Was too obvious. So instead it will trade sideways and crush all options ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

I gotta start jerking off before I make a trade this post nut clarity feels like my third eye has been opened
Yeah wtf… how the fuck does that even happen and now we’re down?!! Wish I could sell options after hours
Why the fuck did my VIX call go from -%50 to +%170 in after hours
My strat to keep myself from blowing up my account is I always keep it small intentionally. I play with a few thousand - if I blow that up no big deal. And when I hit a multi-bagger I just transfer out the excess to savings and keep playing with that few thousand again
You ever drop a turd so pretty you just have to leave it for the next person to see?  My ol lady is mad

What’s everyone think? Spy hitting the ATH tomorrow?
You’re still alive?
cashlow\_
They also mentioned in their call they are shifting from subscriber numbers to hours watched.
I mean, its fairly simple:

Split the stake into 6 trades, each approximately $40K in size. Using the daily, weekly, and monthly time frames, identify 6 stocks each posed to move up 10%, and manage your entries and exits carefully. If each trade on average nets between 12 and 15% per, that's about 22K ish. 

Not to say that's it easy, but there are 25000 stocks just traded on the NYSE. You can find six poised to make a move.
What do we think TLRY tomorrow?
Why didn’t y’all warn me to sell my Netflix calls
So Pfizer is what is going for 5-12 yr olds and no Moderna; fuck that sucks?

What you're saying is statistical nonsense.

The Fed could easily hike rates early in a few months and tank everything... just one example

I'm assuming you're driving a yard spotter with around a 120" wheel base.  That would be easy mode vs a standard sleeper at more than double that length.  You also have a lot better visibility.  BTW, since that's all you do, you would be the professional.
Lmao so Netflix was a fake pump?
Is Netflix gonna tank or what?  Seems like it can’t make up its mind in AH
NFLX calls and puts fucked
It’s not a complicated concept.
Netflixxx, honestly this would be the only porn subscription I'd consider (I mean other than gaybears.com) add to your list, new this week, halloween favourites ... the infrastructure is solid. Take that onlyfans market share. Its a really great idea. Make enough; Tarantino start directing porn, Spielberg follows shortly after.

Seems more reddit people will be buying BB tomorrow, so going to dump all shares before the price drop
I made the decision to liquidate approximately 40% of my boomer SWPPX mutual fund holdings in my brokerage, and will start putting that into riskier plays tomorrow.  God help me.  Lambos or food stamps, baby.

Also liquidated about the same dollar amount from the same mutual fund in my IRA (but that's a much smaller proportion of my total position) and might play around with some trades in there, too.

I am thinking of doubling down on some of my stock plays, and also exploring a long TQQQ position.  Just have to watch that one since I wouldn't want to hold a 3x leveraged ETF through a downturn.

It’s equal part rich daddy and part rich sugar daddy. So yeah. I’m early 40s and single so like to enjoy the sugar from time to time. ;)

Gonna watch $TSLA fly on earnings and crush all the bears that expect a sell the news moment. If it does sell off then I'll be there buying the dip and holding the shares for a few years. 😁💎👐📈🚀
lol what triggers this one
Oh BABA BABA
All in 🅱️🅱️
Send help
I'll buy Netflix at 6.05.
the biggest fish are all over dkng options and long the stock lol
NFLX don’t drag the market down tomorrow
My stomach hurts too
HAHAHA  NFLX... I told you all... P/E is WAY too high and hedge funds are about to train the 30 million new investors that S&amp;P should be around 15-20... Meaning we will have a 30-50% correction over the next 12 months.
Because the IV on the call is 186%. A call about a month out is around 46%. Buying that far in the money is usually a good thing except it doesn’t negate IV always. Most likely your option will lose about 1/4 to 1/3 of its value at open tomorrow.

Lol. You don’t think it will cool off just a little? 2.5% in 3 days after a 5% move in 5 days seems unlikely. Plus, look at the 1 hour. It’s oversold with negative divergence
Lmao NFLX earnings was priced in. Imagine that
Wrong sub my guy
I sold all my shares today. Same, buy back after it falls and loses some volatility
Not a “sell off” I’m extremely bullish into end of year, I just think things are set to pull back a bit to let money managers get in on better prices. Spy could loose a half a percent or so
TLRY is primed for takeoff. Long overdue.
“Remember, remember the Gangbang of September”
Forecast was bad. .80 EPS in the 4th Quarter while analysts were expecting 1.12.
Pretty much. Every 10 years more or less
What’s the point of the leak dont they report every month ? Last month they broke their record
I would honestly, bust so many nuts I'll die of dehydration.
When NFLX inevitably creates a porn subsidiary, should it be called Nutflix or Netfux?
Netflix needs to show growth and this quarter they grew subscribers a lot but they are guiding the same for next quarter Q4 implying that the growth this quarter was a one off and not to expect much growth at least in the near term
Elon has to cash out a big chunk of his options in Q4 this year before expiration. the giga whale is telling you right now he will dump on you. enjoy poverty ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)

Down to 600 would be nice

It’s more like taking it at night and waking up with the mother of all morning woods. #MOAMW. Love doing that with my sugar baby so I can pound her at night even after a few bottles of wine and then even better in the morning.
Thank you SPY. I love you long time
Looks to me like the SPY will be ALL-TIME-HIGH in no time.   Maybe one or two weeks. 


Damn you, Evergrande Group, you shaved two months off America's bull run.

This dude’s mouth feels incredible he’s hittin all the right spots
Why not yolo one ten bagger
'ethical' in the utilitarian sense. 

Also I''m not going to a competitor.  

Ethics against it are: ???
Netflix being abusive with my emotions after hours
I never make money, I’m just always trying to get my money back
NFLX red. Sheeeeeesh
I was thinking Friday morning is when you pile on, probably depends on the overall macro situation of that day too.
I loaded up with more spy calls AGAIN at close. Holy fuck man this is euphoria
I couldn't sell cause of some other shit so now I'm hoping for like at least a .2% day.

If TSLA could leak they sold a billion cars and discovered perpetual energy that would be great
Netflix do the thing.
The texture of oatmeal makes me gag
I most definitely hate my job. I just recognize that I’m currently trapped and powerless to do something about it and 200k just wouldn’t change that for me, with my financial situation and a large family to support. If I had a couple million bucks, I would consider putting my happiness before my obligations.
Some if those puts were 20 baggers the last time 🧐

SOFI calls were in this exact situation and they printed.
So what your saying is this is a good time to buy stock in Netflix.
that’s why you don’t work for anyone
Wtf happened… we were at $459 at one point tf

I’m not shitting on the concept. However, I know some people in coding from universities and many companies even small ones have a very very poor view of bootcampers.
I'm up 100% in the last week, but feel like there was room for 400% if I wasn't such a chickenshit. They really fucked me up in September. After watching my calls expire worthless it took my nerve away. Now I sell at reasonable profit and limit gains.

I just think the earnings for these companies are going to have to be insane for there to be room to grow. I'm not thinking there's a "crash" per say about to happen, but a healthy pullback would be terrific.
It’s best we don’t, just let it happen 🤞🏻

#PRO TIP FOR REVENGE TRADING……….DONT.
I thought I was clever buying a spy put at $450. I may not start averaging down until it hits all time highs again

Too much liquidity right now. All the banks and market makers have made huge gains in the market and there’s no where to put that money except back into the market. The initial fear was consumer spending would drop, and it went the opposite way. Consumers are spending money at record rates and there’s no end in sight.

I quit a job that I was sick of a couple months ago after I got a little over $100k from selling my vested company stock.

Gotta get a new job at some point next year but rn I'm chilling and it's great.
Is BB gonna squeeze?

I thought they banned red days.
Any TBLA bulls?
MSTR is a bomb ready to explode 💣💣 you can buy corn at more tha 10% discount with almost 30% of the float short. Someone is about to panic... squeeeeeeze
It is overvalued by every possible metric lmfao.
Too bad more people didn’t read my bold shit premarket when I said I was tripling down on weeklies…maybe I should’ve made the font size a little bigger….
If it’s discussed in wsb… it’s a meme sadly
MAXINE WATERS NOT HAPPY
Lol tapering next month mark yer calendar
Yeah? My crystal ball tells me that your psychic sense is a joke, bitch!
Nice TLRY is up only needs another 50% before it’s worth a fuk
Bye!
getting to 100k is really the hardest part. my goodness lol

was teased 80ks and sitting between 50-80k almost all year

fucking dkng lol
MSTR is so frustrating
I especially tech/growth that don’t require supply chains to get profits. Very curious how draftkings and roblox and the like will do after huge drops from their highs.

No. If Netflix doesn’t move much the iv of those options will drop significantly and you will lose a lot of value in open.
I tightened my spreads incase it drops tomorrow

New corn ATH incoming and MSTR sells off. 

I bought the dip this morning but everyone likes ETFs now.

No fun.
why would he not be fucked tomorrow? SPY goes up.

So looking back on the day, fomoing into BB $40 January 2022 calls was a bit optimistic
I’m in it for the long haul

Earnings are showing (so far) what we all knew, that companies will be able to pass through costs to consumers.  TSLA's pricing power is that of a luxury brand (like AAPL and other companies like that), so they'll obviously be unaffected, but just seems like very few companies are going to see their earnings hurt from inflation.  Yeah there's bottlenecks in production chains (especially in semiconductors), but those will be resolved over the next 12 months even if higher prices are sticky.

Stocks are the best investment during inflationary times like this (especially while bond yields are being suppressed).  And when you consider that we're unlikely to ever see 5+% interest rates again while the Government's national debt is rocketing, there's just no alternative to stocks.

High inflation levels obviously aren't good for the economy if maintained for too long a period of time (wearing down purchasing power and likely more than negating wage gains), but these inflation levels shouldn't affect corporates.

&gt; it’s not done
My psychic sense once told me tomorrow would be a good day to buy puts
Nice, okay, shall check it out
200k isnt too hard over a 5-10 yr span, hell maybe less. youll get there
tapering begins in a year. let that sink in.
Yeah def possible that happebs
Tis a tough world in here these days. If you’re not spamming BB, AMC, BABA, GME then giiiit out. Miss you 2016 WSB, didn’t know how good we had it
Nah. 200k would burn out in a year for me and my family. My job is one of a kind. The perks and salary I enjoy are too great to give up for 200k
What is up Amazon's butt?
I just enjoy it so much and hope it never stops
Did Netflix announce season 2 of squidward games
Weren’t we saying NFLX growth was done last quarter or two quarters ago?
Because Mara is better
LMFAO... look at the 10Y... Panic will ensue once it hits new highs.  If you're not taking gains... you were warned... Get out of margin.
So airlines was the play huh
No that's 1DTE, not 0DTE. I'm talking literally 75 minutes before the option expires.

Mebbe
Is it any good? I use Ally, and their investment platform is hot garbo
$200,000k is nothing. Certainly not enough to quit a job with certain income. It’s not enough to put into something and live off dividends.
How is tapering being just around the corner not bearish again? And supply chain issues aren’t getting better.. you bulls are fucked after earnings this week
She got a lot of nerve . Divorce her

https://www.wsj.com/articles/day-traders-are-driving-uranium-price-higher-11634637082?
Haha I've bought on the open before, I've just found I'm able to more consistently predict what happens during power hour. Like RSI at 80 coming into a weekend, you almost always see profit taking, so ATM 0DTE puts at 2:45 can be juicers
Pls close at 12.99 on Friday 😅
Yes. Then YOLO $200k into weeklies
Why? Is this you?
SPY gaps down tomorrow? 🤣🤣🤣
They gained 4.4 million subs
Quit my job for 200K? Shit, I'd Quit even if I love my job. With a 200K trading account, I could make 20K a month and just live off that for the rest of my life!
HOOD going to bust a nut tomorrow
EOD puts on a day like today works sometimes...unless futures really bomb it up overnight, but from my unscientific observation: big green close, big sell off at open (for literally maybe 2 minutes so its weapons free at open) 

Big red day, then you're winning at open, if you want to risk further sell off after initial spike then big ball it up otherwise, similarly, dump at open
AAPL AAPL AAPL
I was so close to pulling the trigger on Disney. I think earnings will bring them to mid 160s and that’s when I’ll hop in.
Crazy how my eyes just skip over comments from people without a flair. Like you are literally invisible to me. 😂
And BB is looking good rn
What strike?
It's finally happening!
She told me the opposite
King
Not as gangster as Suge Knight fuking Madonna
&gt; I'm not a fucking idiot.
Do you think the TSLA price was because the earnings that  are coming out. 

Essentially “buying the rumor and selling the news”

Do you see it going up or down after earnings?
netflix growth is done in us. crazy to think about
Can tell that was a dream
Sell TSLA tomorrow morning, tomorrow at power hour, or post earnings/Thursday?
Thats the way Cosby likes it
&gt; I'm not weak
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
How do you stop yourself from buying at open, or the rest of the day for that matter? I am weak
His puts are indeed fucked.
LFG?

I'd quit a job I liked right now for 200k overnight. I can find a new job no fuckin problem in this market; I can't find 200k overnight like that, though.
Probably not maybe at 10 million
But won’t it still go up if I sell at close regardless?
$Clov 💎💎🙌🙌🍀🍀🚀🚀🐋🐳

NFLX looking and performing flat just like my ex
PLTR needs to open at $25.72 tomorrow and then spike over $26. That would be gangster.
It was at 650 then lol
Your wife's boyfriend.....is that not reason enough??
Why is no one talking about $RIOT?
Sold my BABA and MSFT calls, then snagged OTM DIS monthlies at the low today.

Feelin’ pret-ty good about myself right now. Probably isn’t going to last.
blessed be thy gains
sold a few. I'm still in it for the long-term, I think I want a market dip tomorrow so I can rebuy
S’GO!
Idk man. I sold my calls. Didn't look to good going into close
Tomorrow TSLA earnings 🚀🚀🚀
would you quit your job if you hate it,  if you gained 200k overnight?
Lol thats like saying spy will hit 520 by 2024

no need to state the obvious retard
ATH into earnings next week?
The pussy in me was too afraid to hold... now I lose money. Oh well

If you've been waiting to open a Fidelity account or move stuff over now is the time.

$100 to open a new Fidelity account when you fund it with $50 even if you have one already.  Regular trading account, Roth IRA, even works for cash management as well which is basically just a checking account.

Glad I got out of my LUV puts at close. Figured UAL was going to have some optimistic guidance
Could you imagine if SPY gapped down tomorrow? 😂😂😂
Thankfully, I stayed on the sidelines for Netflix earnings. I was scared of IV crush, and now it’s flat as well.
Trying to see me type my password to my phone so she can attempt to steal my shares of amc… she knows what they’ll be worth soon 😜 take tips from mommy it’ll take you a long ways. -dad

Friendly reminder that $TSLA mooned after Q2 earnings.
Sndl is shit.
NFLX puts on earnings work, but not sub-$1k contracts. 

Gotta go 2 weeks, deep ITM.
Hey, maybe we open red, who the hell knows. Good luck.
I know it’s beautiful
For this quarter but they left Q4 on nchanged basically saying this is a one off quarter
Took my $BABA 60K gains this week. Printed my portfolio P&amp;L

There is no such thing as a 0dte expert

Shorted both today. Hopefully at least one works 🤡🤡

Don’t be ridiculous, she’s an archer

Just got insanely lucky holding TME and BABA at 10x leverage since 10 days, and now i went on a tsla + nflx short before close. Lets see maybe my degen luck will work out xd ur not alone
Too bad the moans don’t line up correctly and you end up nutting to a big sceeen of a dudes face
Where do you see the sell-off? Last I checked $NFLX is green/flat after-hours.
Lol 🤡

BB is bumpin

Wow…Never said or implied there was a conspiracy. Simply wondered if I missed news since I was holding a call that went against me while I was busy at work. No need to respond if you’re going to be an ass about it.
Big growth if true
My 520p have been sacrificed
Squid Game is dope. Da fuck you talking about? Better than 99% of the Woke trash the West pumps out.

Are there are 0DTE experts here, planning to play some this Friday and have some questions.

Is is better to load the previous day or wait for a drill down and load up on calls/ puts? What has worked for you guys?
it will :)
Netflix really selling off already 😒 maybe shoulda got outta those calls
Is it suppose to appear behind you in the mirror now?

How do you see this working out for you?
Weren't it not for that stupid Squid Game show, NFLX might have tanked 20%.

Probably.
Lmao good luck friendo. SI is highest its ever been and just got rejected again today. Trading at 1X current year rev. Short it!
They just had their most successful show of all time, plus they didn't cancel Chappelle, and you thought puts.

Well the market also looks at guidance...
They expect how GOOGL posted massive surprise growth last earnings or its dropping….

The important part is you tried
Puts won’t print, calls won’t print; wtf
What if she went up against Chris Brown?
SPY and QQQ shoot up on NFLX earnings, NFLX goes red because "sell the news" and bad subscriber growth yet the indexes don't care.  By the time we get to AAPL everything will be at all time highs before even saying a word about results.  Incredible.
=| It has a lot of high-interest debt, it's in an industry that will not go away but definitely become a niche product, it issued tons of shares and it is overpriced. This is not a conspiracy. Probably some institution sold so it could buy something more relevant like netflix.
&gt;Joy Reid vs. Any White Woman

Fuck, I'd watch that
NFLX gonna open red af tomorrow
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/noobc4k3 (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 460.0 when it was 442.98 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
150 11/12 and 145 10/29 here
I’ve got two call credit spreads on Netflix that expire Friday.  Anybody got ideas on Tesla for earnings? I’m planning on a super wide iron condor

Lol at my irl friend who thought netflix would shoot up after earnings and lol at me for being right but not selling calls
I am on a 5 day winning streak, so I loaded up on 0dte SPY puts before close.
Not as ridiculous as CHWY holders

Short term confused as a teenage girl... Long term extremely bearish.
Behold all you degenerates. If you didn’t noticed already. $BB is gonna be the play this week.
Tomorrow it might reverse
Damn NFLX fuck your calls and puts I guess
You make me realize I need to go theta gang. They got you coming and going.
I will chop a ball off if it hits $150 by end of next week
The way small caps (IWM/Russell 2000) have held up the past 2 months really looks like a nice setup for a breakout in the final 2 months of the year.  Obviously they've been consolidating since Feb-March.  Same thing happened last year with really strong relative action from small caps during the September-October 2020 selloff.

Catalyst last year was the election launching everything, but I'd expect JPow/tapering start to be the catalyst this year.

Timing lines up perfectly with the early November Fed meeting (matching last year's election), so I'm just loading up 2-3 month out ATM IWM calls on the dips.

We'll see what happens but it just looks like small caps are due for a 10+% run and that's a logical basis for the next big move past ATHs (SPY 454/etc.) for markets.
It’s hard out here as a full time student 😔
Lol keep wishing buddy
Keep on chugging until Friday $AAPL

Didn’t he try to build a pillow company and failed miserably?
Props to OP though on that entry lol.

A +14% and our bro is still red. Still it's looking way better than before.
Vix calls might be a good move rn. Yes we should be trending downward on vix back towards prepandemic levels as has been the trend for the last year but we are about to enter the tapering phase and it’s not like inflation and high oil prices will help reduce the volatility. For those reasons when I look at right now compared to two weeks ago I would say the volatility level is the same because those were the same issues back then and now we’re only closer to the taper. However vix is asymmetrically lower
YOLO it into TLRY calls it will make you feel better.  I promise.
I been crushing this
Is another man's pile of moldy old bread with flies that is quickly decomposing
I need to therapeutically murder a few people and get $100 million dollars in the next month after this trading day.
Posted in the other thread but sharing more picks here, if you think I’m wrong on any of these don’t hesitate to let me know, but you’re all retards so ya know, I won’t listen:

TLRY below $12 - BUY (11/26 12.5 C are under $100)

KERN below $3 - BUY

Barclays $11 - up 15% this month but banks will benefit when fed rates inevitably rise. 

Charles Schwab $81 - Could wait for a dip, might come back down to around $70, but long term should be easily over $100 per share. Leaps could be fun. 

Callaway (ELY) $27 right now, this should be above $50 long term. Earnings 11/8, popped after earnings last two times. 

Raytheon $91 - I mean come on… with the MIC the way it is there’s no way this company should be under $100 per share. It’s a joke at $90. If you don’t like war stocks I’ll assume you also don’t like money. 

Cinemark $20 - missed out on AMC? Why not grab the competition? They have half the theatres but are trading at half the price, sounds fair to me. Also Cine is bigger internationally and yes there balance sheet is dog shit but not as dog shit as AMCs. If that can run so can this. 

Aight that’s it. Today was a good day, back to regularly scheduled blood red tomorrow probably
That's why I thought a year ago , but now I changed my mind after Tesla built their own chip for their Dojo supercomputer to simulate real world driving.
Than*

Wonder why
Do you have to deflate her to clean it out after “she ate it” or can you just stick a vacuum up the rear entrance?
AMC drills more and my wife leaves her bf for me. Tomorrow is the day.
Who the fuck smashed market order on 4M shares of WISH?
27K shares wtf
*if i put it in italics then i can slip it in undetected*
aw shit
One man's garbage....
Wisdom tooth acting up again, puts on my sleep tonight
Lol I own 100 shares and may be adding 200 more, bought calls today at 12:50 eastern time when I saw it up to 10.22 😎
Get your money, king.
Let's go BB
Prepare for the exact same earnings after $TSLA. It will beat but analysts already know so it will be a sell off
Bb BABY!!!!! Let’s go $9.50 average 400 shares :)
AMC
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
AMC
You should have bought SPY when your DIX told you 🤷
AMC
I just eat gummies now and I don’t get all smelly
Maybe 520
Drop hard before the Santa rally
Lol he reminds me of Hugh hefner
[deleted]
There's data being released next month. It's going to the moon or the ground
Put it out of its misery
TLRY. This is the Way
Reid Hastings better give the worst guidance I’ve ever heard tonight
Well would it kill you to buy a share of Tilray with your next bag?  Give it to your kid or grandkid and who knows it could moon.  These bags are heavy for an old dinasuar like me.
I dunno it’s old now. Too easy. Every girl wearing them. 

Prefer a sexy dress myself.
It hit revenue exactly. EPS was a beat and subscriber numbers were up. Still, good news takes a couple days to digest sometimes.
Yo what the fuck is this what’s the catch lmao
They always drop after earnings. Plus guidance was dick
Buy BB
Confirmation bias, the best drug. Thanks, stranger!
Any chance SPY will hit 420 again in 2021?
Spy AH got me rock hard
No but I’m sure at 9 years old, she can take him.
SPY AH is ridiculous
Check my last post. This week is going to make or break me
TLRY, the comeback kid??
Netflix makes money off of YOU 

Not the other way around
Asked the wife if she wants a $6 brc burrito from our local Mexican lunch spot and she says sure I’ll have the $20 fajita combo plate 🙄
I’m going home early it’s too cold in this office.
No I don't buy garbage and expected it to be worth anything
Girlfriend got a job so I tripled my 403b contribution, so now I can invest on Robinhood with greater recklessness
How’s Tesla looking tomorrow? Is it still fucking me?
Disappointing guidance maybe?
Maybe they are monitoring this sub
Every time I get close to my ath from February the market takes a fat dump on me. Based on this we probably only have one more day of green before the recession starts
Spent money on BB calls
[deleted]
$RBLX for generations
Same
Im about to get a coffee and smoke a blunt on a cruise ride
I saved a spot in the back of Wendy's just for you.
Oof
Ite
Swamp fud so the plebs sell
JACK MA
Premiums on CRTX are insane
Oh shit I haven’t looked at MVIS in forever, shits rekt
TSLA always goes red when this sub gets bullish on it
Was the bully David Hogg?
Yes, I need to make a post, fed Ex is gonna gap up
You must be new
lol, poor
I got some premium jenkem.
Oh no. It's retarded.
Lmao should i buy stocks that are 80% overvalued?
 Get her the new macbook pro 16"
Why isnt NFLX going up more? It beat its earnings expectations.
Oh wow we came out with one show that boosted our numbers. We might have another season next year maybe.
I think leggings have ruined the appeal of skirts. Show them legs, not what you want them legs to be.
Theta gang: thanks for playing NFLX see you next quarter
Agreed for sure - but shares will be sexy soon too
Should have scalped TLRY calls and switched to puts eod, smh
Do I dare buy NET puts tomorrow?
Nasdaq all time high is 15,403. Go for it but it’s too hi. Good luck, folks.
#$TLRY is the brother I never had. The one that gives me money.
What made you buy puts? Was it closing above all major momentum indicators?
Yes , do it !
Bought Netflix puts 2min before close, panicked and bought Netflix calls as well 1min before close.. Tmr will be a fun day 😎
RED LIGHT

&amp;#x200B;

GREEN LIGHT

&amp;#x200B;

BOOM U DEAD
Sold my 12/31 calls today. Will have to buy more if we ever see another dip again.
🙏
NFLX puts tomorrow
I like my pain and happiness all at once
not yet, whatchoo got?
They don’t care only about their card, your total available credit matters.
Stock market is the best place for institutions to park their money right now. We'll continue up until that isn't true.
HA TAKE THAT! WISH is back to prices it hasn’t seen in 3 weeks
Love it. Good luck to you!
name a time a tech company has raised prices for consumers without major product change

NFLX raised prices, but they offered different levels of devices/quality and a fuckton of new content
#im a bagholder of BB still (27k shares at $12.87/ea.)…goal profit is $600k. I firmly believe that will happen in mid 2022….
Why so diverse?
Google and Apple are retarded for not making it easy to turn their phones into dash cams so that they can get all that wasted driving data
Takes a dummy to know a dummy dummy
My daughter beat up a kid who bullies her and pushed her, think he likes her, she suspended but I’m proud af. Going to get ice cream 🍦
Oh Boy, Squid Game!!!   

NFLX pops then tanks 20 pts AH. lol
Are you high?
✋🏼✋🏼
Come on poor Netflix guidance, don’t let me down!
Holding my 47 contracts of 456C 10/22 and 5 contracts of $457C 10/22 till SPY is $460 tomorrow or Thursday. Will make an easy 10K+ bagger.
TLRY
I have 3 credit cards, 2 of them with more then 1.5K credit and discover still won’t raise my credit limit past $500 what the fuck

Ozark season 10 also
I assume the majority of us do
Yeah, I'll wait until about 11:00 to see what's what then go from there.

Lol then that’s fine. I was close to start buying puts, but the earning momentum is pretty crazy right now. I’m gonna wait for eow.
Have fun with the -80% stock
WISH WISH!
AMD gave me a scare in the morn but spy calls as always saved my rear
Semiconductors...
BB
Yeah JPOW. Giga-Hawk
I sniff hard as fuck every time
i think waymo is gonna be the autonomous driving champion
Wtf how?
The 0.23 ones?
Hopefully stop being a bag holder for BB up 2,840.00 today only 1,600.00 to go.

Dreams do come true.  (To brake even lol)
The internet has no supply chain
Where do you think SPY will be end of year?
Lolz...NFLX gave just enough time for the institutions to dump...
Who here smokes weed?
Madmen
Playing a round of solitary squid game sounds like a euphemism for beating off
Market running up the stairs isn't fun. Market jumping out of the airplane is fun.
Have you seen the IV on the options for Netflix?
This interactive brokers guy is not cooperating with CNBC narrative.  Guy thinks all his customers are morons.  I kinda like him
NFLX is literally at its ATH wherein FB is still 10%+ off. It’s the best tech play.
The front line is everywhere
Made 10k so far this week and still dead inside
Honestly hold till tomorrow. We may bounce before earnings. I’m a bear but I think 870 is a magnet
There is none stay green bro

🤷🏼‍♂️
As long as there's no penetration, it's OK.
We seriously on the way to tech 16000? The fuck?  What happened to hurdur inflation and supply chain issues
!remind me 24 hours
&gt; I don't see how that's relevant.
Ok bagholding idiot
I have a hard rule to not go big in options against any stock I see in my daily life.  For awhile there I was middle fingering every FedEx truck I saw after a sizeable loss.  

I now confirm this rule works well as I will be watching Netflix tonight without it invoking anxiety and fuck me feelings.
Give me one reason to be bearish. Just one and I’ll do it
Girls who wear clean black leggings where you can clearly see the shape of their ass and like to have their shirt lifted a bit so we can see &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Let's talk, I got some today and think it will be fun to watch
I'm not on NFLX but I'd like to see it go well so TQQQ can moon to $150 by end of next week
First time playing earnings? That’s literally 75% of movement AH.
They are smearing him. He’s too hawkish

https://youtu.be/bZAbq_WDJPY
No. Probably back under 11 eow. I've got 500 shares, bought low, *didn't* sell high -  I want to see it hit 30, but...it won't any time soon.
Ugh. Guess I'll take my $4K loss and try again next time.

No need to feel down, guess I'll try and look for more plays.
Literally the moment I buy SPY puts a giant green candle appears
WISH?  
I wish that I had never seen this stock
I had a dream where Greta Thunberg recommended it
Take your profits don’t be a bag holder
$BITO is an ETF so it's fair game
TLRY
Its a stock technically but shunned upon nevertheless, like kissing your cousin
TLRY GANG CHECKING IN
bought some Tesla after hours 🙂
Here is fine, but the coin itself and others go on the other sub
MCD?
lmao GOOG is basically at ATH you will get IV crushed
I wish I had an island all to myself, what’s it like?
Up 180% on my BB calls.  Got in late.
Squid Games, priced in. People being brain dead, priced in. People insisting that it's not priced in, priced in.
Ya BUT SqUID GAmE
i understand some of these words
TSLA will take spy to the moon tomorrow 🚀
AAHHHH haha! All the wish haters in here gona be chasing soon. Sucks to suck!
True.
Yea. And yea but a dip preceding usually isn’t a good sign. Which is why I bought my put debit spreads Monday.
I would wait tomorrow on Netflix and look at what happened Jan 19. Shit sometimes has huge swings.
I don't MIND
🤣
Which ticker
can we talk about BITO in here or is that for WSBcrypto only?
JPOWs portfolio is just a bunch of bonds.

And a little Vanguard 500 ofc
You shouldn't
$clne looks promising.
this actually a good snek play no one gonna see it in the scroll tho
"Fed's Waller says high inflation through year end may need 'aggressive' response"

SPY moon mission confirmed until EOY
Never stopped
Don't get ink in your eye
Hope you priced in some lube
I’m officially just moving to shares. 6000 shares of SoFi and 8000 FCEL take me to the tendie land
So fun to have tech earnings back.
nah man I’m aight
Wish GOOG would start doing its +3% before earnings thing, I'm running out of time.
Tesla puts after earnings is the play.  Get past the IV crush.  Just like spring TSLA will begin its descent back to reality again
Same as always, steady growth $SNDL and $BB
Ya, I can see that now 😅
Death gripped my 10/20 450c 's today. LFG.
$FDX 240 weekly 10/22 load the boat 🛥
drink every time they say Squid Game on the Netflix call.
Beat. They're expensive bc ppl expecting a big move
lmao Netflix is having a whole ass character arc in ah
Earnings is out ya zeta cuck, you so 10 mins ago
TILRAY. 

#WE WILL MARRY TILRAY. TIL RAY DO US APART.  💍 

$TLRY $30+
I expect a pull back here, a small one I see the xlu moving up.
Not yet...
agreed + $SNDL, no financial advise.
Don’t mess with the PLUG, it’s going to $40.
But isn't earnings after hours? And usually come with a dip?

I obviously hope TSLA exceeds $900 tomorrow. but still.
About to play the squid game by myself
PSA - That psychedelic stock everyone and their uncle was pumping back around April has fallen to 5 month lows, and Jan 2023 2.50 calls are on sale for \~$90/contract.
The CEO of SPY is gonna tweet “I think the price is too high IMO” tonight maybe idk I never met the guy
Wow it’s already getting autistic in here
Congrats to all NFLX earnings players were all fuck! 

Also congrats theta gang.
Should have bought the lows last week… best to play the run up and sell before ER before you get fucked via IV crush
I'm feeling good about these 448p
Can somebody explain why ASAN gets almost no love here?
Tlray!!!!! To the moon
What an after hours performance on Netflix, brought to you by the Theta boomer gang!!
NFLX just fucking say squid game season 2 for the guidance call and hang up the phone
#$BB $TLRY $SDC $WISH $CLOV $AMC $GME $SKLZ $PSFE $ROOT $BABA $AMD $SPY

IF YOU ARE IN ANY OF THESE TICKERS TOMORROW YOU WILL HAVE 10-60% GAINS

$TLRY GANG
i'll go to the looney bin with you
10/29 825/820 put debit spreads. They pay 4:1 atm and I bought them at 6:1
$BB gang unite!!! Moon baby moooooooon 🌙🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵
shorted NFLX at 646 on 4x margin. this thing is overvalued with the shitty subscriber growth
NOT SELLING $WISH UNTIL $9.80 PT $10

https://i.imgur.com/NXS43Mr.png
definitely yes
Whoever has Tesla calls or puts, I'd say sell them tomorrow because it might pull a netflix being completely neutral or not moving
Theta gang wins with Netflix
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
I start preparing myself for the meme stock rally in Jan 2022
Plz do. Then I shall load calls perfectly timing the bottom.
Well $nflx call/put buyers will eat IV crush tomorrow
Owwwww NFLX is about to destroy my account if it doesn’t dump by open
what's the consensus on SNAP calls for earnings. they seem expensive
That is already priced in, otherwise, $BABA would be a 1 trillion USD company.
Abysmal lol. It opens red tomorrow
Just the ugly flight attendants ☹️
So Netflix is smoking all the options holders kinda worrisome for my fb calls next week
You’re about to be down 80% by EoW.
Why tf would you do that?
SPY options expire on Wednesday. MMs need to adjust the chain and give the nod to the devastated 🌈 🐻
Yeah, that's totally how it works!
I bought TLRY brother on command
NET monthlies?
Earth is a dodecahedron and birds travel through dimensions idiot
not a bad buy, cms for a lot of internet, smoeone has beentracking their spread on the internet and even amzn is on fastly now
Imagine thinking this having never traded a bear market
unfortunatley I can't. I closed my futures account.
Damn. Wednesday TSLA calls? HOOK ME UP
Put holders are fine if it’s not Friday expiration. Call holders are going to get railed though.
Holy shit. All time new high score.

And put in a market order for 1000 shares of FSLY at open…what fucking luck for it to spike 10%. I just wish I had been able to get some calls instead
Look at that hammer on the 5m chart. Diverging volume on the downward run. 15m and 30m charts look more bearish. Tomorrow will be interesting. Two rounded tops but it might be meaningless. It looked sort of like that 2 weeks ago as well and then wedged and broke out anyway.
BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕

I was hoping UAL would flop 😔
'cuz SPY don't give a fuck about your man
Hindsight. Profit is profit
that netflix guidance is absolute trash for q4
Get distracted few more times then
Congratz NFLX Theta Gang especially the ones who sold strangles.
IBKR CEO sounds like he gonna sell me some fake rolexs after he gets off the cnbc interview
Ya see how NFLX is just flat after ER, same is going to happen with TSLA tomorrow buy calls or puts if you like pain
Boomer Theta gang wins again on NFLX
Tempted by Fastly $FSLY to 100$ by eoy.
Netflix beat and this was the result. TSLA apes really think its gonna gain another 50-150 billion in market cap after another expected decent quarter. LOL
Lol sick pump Netflix.
Yes, but not for you. Unless you had TLRY options today.
Watching LAD Moon!
Sold my 12/21 $222.5c for NVDA. 

Time to buy 12/21 $230c for NVDA.
Disney has been limp for months. I want to see how this month goes. If goes to mid 160s I’ll buy some slightly OTM calls.
That’ll do, pig. Cash gang for a bit until there’s another nice entry like FB last Friday.
best advice
I can never tell with you, if you're Bullish, Bearish or just neutral
So SPY is finally coming back to its all time high.

So I bought a couple 450c 11/19.

Cant wait for SPY to tank due to FUD
Look up the meaning of “Black Swan Event”  then when the shame goes away come back and apologize to the entire board for this stupid comment
364 more days til next years try outs, gotta toughen up!
watch for some stupidass stock pumpping announcement tomorrow morning
I don't know, although on paper it looks bullish, just wait for the US to slap it with sanctions for providing chips to the Chinese army. That's always the risk with Chinese tech stocks, the moment they make something useful there are fears the CCP is going to use the tech.
At open? I’m selling right away I don’t get how I’d profit
🚀BB 🚀
It's proof of concept of the business model. Make super cheap shows around the world. They have built in local audiences, and some of them might turn out to have international appeal.

IV crush
&gt;Bought puts ~~on $PLUG~~ what a mistake that was 

There.
Bets on if we see a single red day this week? A homie’s gotta write some puts 😔
confirmation incoming
It's a thin line, between calls and puts
Should I be worried about $11 BB covered calls that I sold last week for 11/12 and 11/19 expiry? I don't think this price will hold, but I also don't want to lose my shares.
App icon is red
People in here are so braindead they really bet against fucking Squid Game
Imagine how far Tesla falls.
NFLX earnings crush, theta wins again 💀💀💀
Looks like my NFLX options are gonna expire worthless....where's the jackass that recommended me to buy calls and puts?
Red tomorrow. Shit is way overbought.
BITW...what a piece of garbage this fund is. While just about everything related to that funny coin is kicking A@#, this fund is playing submarine...."Dive, Dive, Dive..."
We already have JPOW. What more do you need?
Calls on NFLX trannies give the best head.
Gunna be distracted in the office. Might just get drunk.
Netflix Dead AH. RIP. I bet all their net subs are just 15 day trails.

SDC had to close at 5.99 instead of 6-
With how things are going, draftkings and roblox are at a discount right now.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses)let's go NDAQ.
Are cute flight attendants just as horny as we are?
IBKR bb. What you doing
Please sell everything tomorrow and do research. Learn to read a balance sheet and how the capital markets work lol. You’re going to lose money
Post the loss for a pick-me-up
NET bull run continues tomorrow?
I have a very ill feeling for you bulls... PE ratios are about to be taught to the new 30 million traders out there...
Throw it all into the opposite of what you think you should do quickly.
Netflix earnings green or red?
Imagine thinking trading is hard
any gap ups should have some profit-taking at open lol
Put on TLRY
EOW
12%? alright. adjusting my sell limits
I'm in. I said fuck that I'll go with spy, and it gained 6%
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)
Looks like big boys gonna sell off NFLX AH and early tomorrow? Wouldn't be surprised if we wake up to -3-5% lol. This bitch has been running up 20% in a month!
Excited to see the NFLX loss porn once they get theta cucked tomorrow
Bought puts on $PLUG what a mistake that was 😔
PROG!!!
Cuz i fucking sold a second before
That meme with the peeps gathered round cheering for the 5$ they have in nflx is definitely me right now .
Are you high?  Nothing is diving lol
How were there even 4 million people without Netflix accounts left?
Hard to enjoy even big victories because I look at how my timing could have been better. Whether it’s holding too long or selling too soon I always get the “what ifs” either way made $35k today on tlry and rolled it into spy puts. Hoping for a big dip in the next week even if it is just temporary
Debit spreads don’t get IV crushed. Do your fucking homework idiot
Dont worry youll give back soon enough
Anyways, my puts are bust
Huge volume on BB today out of nowhere.

Something big about to happen
I'll hop back in SPY as soon as it corrects a bit, all hail BITO
Yeah I did calls got it right for once it seems lol
Bezos dick rocket lasted longer than NFLX’s rocket
lot of time for them to cook
I was expecting atleast 47 million
Squid games isn’t going to launch Netflix to the moon
I lost 120k in september  :)
I'd get in on that for sure. My "high yield" Marcus account is at 0.50% right now LOL.
Consumes more calories than he burns.
Yes
Lol at ALL tech diving because of NFLX. 🥴
When it works it’s great though, total coin flip.
you know it's earning season when NFLX call holders and put holders get fucked
Or a slight drop at open before it flies again
Debit spreads always make money if you get the directional move right. Naked options during earnings is always retarded
For sure, I would take a guaranteed 4% per day.  Sure I made 10x that today, but today was a good day, the comfort of knowing guaranteed 4% of day would be worth it.
[deleted]
Happens to the best of us
markets not gonna make it past this round of earnings.
Very true, but there are lots of old things plus some random stuff. Castlevania has an anime. I miss 5 bucks a month.
Bois I’m up 21k this week , that is not normal-right?  fuck this sucks   Im not use to this
TILRAY🚀🚀🚀
Hello IV crush my old friend
Someday.  Right now NFLX is doing what a lot of stocks might do when there's a huge surge of people bidding them up prior to earnings -- even if they beat, everyone who wanted to buy has already bought, and doesn't want to pay even more for the shares.
SPY with that shrek dick into the close.
You don't but lots of people do.
GUH MY CALLS
Nothing better than when you’re about to buy something and get distracted, only to find the price dropped 5%
$BABA to 200$ by end of the year. Their homemade ARM-based Chip looks amazing. https://www.reuters.com/technology/alibaba-unveils-custom-arm-based-server-chip-cloud-computing-division-2021-10-19/
If you bought like 400c you would break even lmao
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Lmaooo obviously TSLA needed a small pullback before tomorrow’s +12% day. Chill tf out guys.
BB about to skyrocket in flight, afternoon delight whoooo
I did the same thing.
More buyers than sellers
TILRAY🚀🚀🚀
Again in lambos
Lmao flat earnings for NFLX both sides fucked
Yeah because TSLA makes 100x the revenue of every other car maker right? 🤡

Even with no competition in the market at all, it would be a little difficult to call Tesla undervalued.
Take a good old American profit - buy steaming hot Dutch $BROS calls!
Tomorrow is TSLA earnings you ape
Lol the stock is still down 42% since Jack Ma's ill fated speech last October. It's barely started to recover.
TLRY 🦍
See you tomorrow
NFLX just hit ATH, going fuckin wild right now AH
Netflix will hit $700
It ran 50% in three months and has a bunch of shit priced in? RSI was at 90 yesterday lmfao
Calls on Anastasia holy fuck me
When real inflation is double digits and interests rates are 0. Where else do you go with your money? Assets
Dafuq with this comment
My NDAQ calls exp in November I'm hoping this trend continues strike is at 195. If it does it'll print biggley...
Rip Netflix options from both sides
Fun right?
Without squid game, NFLX would've already down 20%
The postal service? Is that an actual thing?
#People who put in the hours, work hard, hustle, stay hungry in the financial world: +0.05% fully diversified portfolio and hedged


Some guy named Nicholas: *buy meme* +15% in 1 hour
Just need confirmation of downtrend and I'm balls deep in puts
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Its P/E used to be in the 1200's, and now it's only in the 400's. Room to grow!
I was so close to doing this as a hedge kinda glad I didn’t
High implied volatility for earnings, so they need would need a lot more than a 1% more to move their options.
Their guidance is shit from what I saw
Dam, IBKR cucked me hard
imagine gambling you're money on earnings
Man I was literally staring at BABA 170c when it fell at close yesterday. Such a pussy.
Little price movement AH means both calls and puts will lose.
Call holders in shambles as well
Yep. Anyone playing earnings on anything has gotten crushed except the last SNAP earnings
IV crush
remind me to never play earning calls every again
March 2020 was a very interesting time here lol
I almost bought but I actually looked at the premiums and then realized how retarded they were so I stayed away.
8 years away
Too much squid game hype for Netflix
If USPS opens a savings accounts with interest rate of 4% then GOOD BYE stock market.
Someone explain this to me, do the 🦍 really think they’re going to DRS 100% of the float
[deleted]
SPY 1HTE
Amc bagholders😂😂😂
Disney loses 3% market cap in a day for telling analysts it expects low single digit million q4 sub growth.    


Netflix: we grew our sub count by 4mil.  HuGe BeAt!
Lmao good for nothing paper hands
🏳️‍🌈🐻 never learn
Because IV is going to get crushed so whether you bought puts or calls you need a big move to make any money
NFLX IV Crush, needs to be up 4% for break even
Bought spy puts at close. 450p. Looks like I won’t be sleeping tonight. Dunno why I do this.
Why does Pedro Martinez head look like Don Zimmer’s?
TLRY bagholders don't even realize they're already dead
Baba $300 eoy plz
Just got checked for macular degeneration.  Officially not a degenerate, take that you retards
It’s had 3 big Green Day’s in a row
an actual black swan doing something funny
Going down hard tomorrow. They needed a huge beat and this wasn't it
Can someone explain me easy why a lot of things are Up?
Theta gang flawless victory on NFLX earnings
It feels like we are long overdue for a correction but the market said fck it let's keep getting high
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
Option chain was pricing in 5%+ move
Don’t be scared BABA has plenty more upside.
loading up on the ASTS dip while tech earnings takes the spotlight
Keep thinking that. I’ll buy some Tesla again at 750 in a week.
&gt; I'm not sure, but I think it's because he eats too much.
#Market Pump bait, don’t take it! Economic numbers spell doom.

There’s a lot of regions in the world that haven’t had broadband internet until recently.
Didn't beat revenue so not a beat imo
10/22 HOOD $43 calls. Going to $47 by Friday
BB finish over $11.50 can only mean gap up overnight
Yooooo how did Pedro Martinez head get so fat!?!
# BB
NFLX pleas don’t take my boy spy down with you tomorrow

Why cucked?

Now tesla begins to heal

Fuckin gey
Weed california legalization boom $TLRY biggest market share
In shambles
Just need TLRY to move 15% four more times and I'll finally break even! 

*cries on the inside*
My prediction Netflix opens up 2% tomorrow 2.23% to be exact gg
I'd expect they lift guidance for q4 honestly.
This is the tamest reaction I have seen to an earnings report AH.
NFLX IV CRUSH
Options buyers getting cucked by 1% move on NFLX 🤡
Not willing to make a bet put I see BB pumping to 30 by end of year.
NFLX IV CRUSH BABY, WHY AM I CRYING, I BOUGHT PUTS AND CALLS
**already dumping LMAO**
I'm at work
Why tomorrow?
I bought some SPY 11/15 480c as a joke this morning to go with my banbet made last week. I've been joking about these far OTM calls that are a month or two to expiry since September. What if it's not a joke?
And back to 8 by Monday 😂
SPY puts so obvious ima end up loosing money lolz
Wth happened with WISH?
Dolla dolla bill y’all
U r double fuk (IV crush)
Argh why did I close 40% of my 10/20 spy 450 calls
I manage to fuck everything up every time man
Haha, guess not
Yeah I wouldn’t be shocked if it ended AH in the red but it’s still funny

just shorted netflix AH. numbers are pretty disappointing
How heavy? I’ll call the Uber to come pick you up.
I have a feeling we see another all time high before another pull back just so the fed can say they didn’t sell the top
TSLA fucked me today too. And then watch it ramps up again next week although my Calls expire tomorrow. -\_\_-

Edit: I meant Friday, I am the dumb.
u/jollyradar with the balls made of 💎 placing that 1day banbet
Sofi was just dead today
Congratulations on the IV crush Netflix
you must have invested in GME or AMC...i'm so sorry lol
The vips are
Theta gang sends its regards
I would not be surprised if Netflix opens at 700 tomorrow. It had crazy gaps in the past.
Yess lord
Moment of silence for those that had puts on NFLX….
MASSIVE green candle on QCOM in the last minute lmao
Second mortgage on BB
TSLA undervalue as it is
That’s called fomo
10/20 here loaded to the tits
Netflix pump is a bait.
Pls lord.  My bags are 9 months old and heavy
You okay?
Not looking good for nflx option holders. Can honestly see this going red if the call doesn't hit a home run.
Mooooore BB
the market loves biden
The up move is weak.
Hopefully iron condor
That was the Pre-dip
wow im so stupid, why didnt I think of that??
I hope so, holding CGC warrants
I think we all know how it’s going to go now
Come on that is one show in a sea of shit
My TSLA calls r fuk
disney lost 3% in a day on the same information.
meme stocks are byke
Xlf breaking 40 tomorrow btw
Ath by the end of the week.  We will be heading back down in mid November as taper is announced and the last of the “transitory inflation” people are shook out
But why the tesla dip??
So much money made today unless you were 🌈

I had Limits setup to close at profit since I couldn't watch my trades, and most of them closed. I am accidentally sitting in around 80% cash and need to find somewhere to out it before inflation eats it.
You know what this reminds me of March 2020 when we all bought spy 240p lmao except now I’m riding the trend the opposite way when everyone thinks it’s gonna crash
Literally just made up for all my bad plays today
 10/22 SPY 450c’s
This is why I hate playing Tech earnings. Always giant moves AH that fade and do crazy shit by the time it opens the next day
MODS WE NEED MONEY PRINTER EMOJI
After Squid Game?
Hope no one played NFLX because IV is gonna rape you
Soooo buy SoFi? Got it
Tomorrow Papa Elon takes us to Mars.
Decent day ngl
Yeah market was pricing in more of a move then this these clown are getting iv crushed on open
Anyone just hear something?
I got both Netflix puts and calls. Wish me luck, it has to go either way
Didn't it just come out that they're now holding major real estate bags on houses they can't flip anymore (for a profit)?
PROG
I’ll probs send a spread. Bullish af on tech tho.
“I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.” - my port
If NFLX beat like this and thats the reaction I’d be afraid if I was a TSLA shareholder. Barely 1% green off great numbers and its also weird to think their run up is nowhere near are insane as Tesla’s.
Imagine buying pits on Netflix after Squid game went viral 🤡🤡
Squids buying nflx. lol
fuck bers
Don’t worry kids the alibaba train will be open tomorrow at 9:30am get it while you can
Try my mum.

some of yall about to learn what IV crush is :)
3.19 eps
Ok Skillz its your turn to pop off tomorrow
Mister Burry, you have been margin called along with your investors for betting against America, land of the apes.
Don't underestimate the draw of a naked Henry Cavill.
chump change lotto play
I truly dont understand how Netflix keeps getting subscribers. WHO the fuck is singing up?
This dude’s mouth got me all up in my feelings, oh man
Too many $NFLX put bagholders here.
Whose ass I eat is my business.
Could be puts aswell but in the end their both hail Mary options
I wouldn't, it seems like they are sitting on a pile of houses they cannot sell.
They beat
I don’t use margin.
I'm bored, someone give me a play
Did Amazon miss last quarter?
the nflx move ah is actually massive considering it's already up 30% the past 2 months

was expecting red from all the profit taking
Pleas post NFLX loss porn tomorrow!
netflix fucking your calls and puts
crossing my fingers, picked up some puts
Well, no
Why is it mooning tho?
Ual puts free money btw
WSB was all in on NFLX Puts 

The rest is history 🙄🤣
Market makers and even the media all went full bullish today. Every article and interview was straight bullish on new ATHs.

# Calls on Kleenex
Can I talk on here again yet?

Define rip.
Rip
AMZN deep OTM calls gonna print for earnings
Where the subscriber numbers at!?!
[deleted]
&gt; I am an asshole
456 would be even better
I keep getting texts from "Rory with Working America" about political BS.  If there anything I can do to entertain Rory?
Would be great. My Puts will print
NFLX

Revenue: $7.48 billion vs. $7.48 billion expected, $6.44 billion Y/Y 

Earnings per share: $3.19 vs. $2.56 expected, $1.74 Y/Y 

Net subscriber additions: 4.38 million vs. 3.72 million expected, 2.2 million Y/Y
Bless you SPY
I didn’t play it, but I think NFLX will eat a fat dongus.
FEKTTTT
Nflx calls anyone?
No revenue beat for NFLX.
There is a difference between bullish and full retard FOMO all in margin risk on. We are the latter.
Try 40+
How do no tech companies ever miss earnings? Fucking analysts need to stop lowballing, it’s pathetic
Shrek had boner all day on SPY chart

I had boner all day at work 

Coincidence? Unlikely.
Since everyone was asking, here is my $WISH position. Holding until a parabolic move comes or holding until earnings. Either way I don't care.

https://i.imgur.com/NXS43Mr.png
I’m gonna hope this renewables wave continues and cross my fingers on an IBM earnings play
the momentum on everything is stupid high, so goofy. wen rug pull
WTF happened today? I had a meeting g all afternoon and I come back to all sorts of shit being up. 

It's like JPow and the SEC told them to give retail all they're money back.
Well there goes my Netflix put lol
Why did BB pump like that?
TLRY as always
As a hedge fund CEO, I'm surprised at how astute some of the redditors are. I mean how did they manage to figure out that I browse their 1500 member subs searching for any semblance of clues as to their strategy, and we have an alarm ringing 20 hours a day because these goddamn diamond hands just won't sell, no matter how many short ladder attacks we throw at them. I tried to get the interns to message them (instead of research solid companies/strategies) to convince them to sell, but still no luck. Truth be told, it's getting exhausting. Me and my other hedge fund CEO buddies are at our wit's end, the fact that combined they own 1% of a 4B companies float is enough to seriously make any attempts we throw at them to reduce the stock price futile. Thinking I might just retire, these apes are just too damn strong. The fact that they figured out our 100 step playbook of naked shorting, bribing politicians, short ladder attacks, photoshopping fake gain posts to convince them to sell after a 1000% run up, creating bots that say "hey maybe this isn't a great idea?", and so on is amazing. I thought we were too discrete and threw too many hurdles. Maybe a better use of my time would've just been hiring PhD quants to research the stock market, having my employees actually research stocks and AI algorithms instead of FUD tactics, and make legit gains.
What set it off today?
Holy Jesus bears fekt?
Netflix added 4.4 million subs in one quarter? God damn.
FRONT MAN MADE BANK
Would be pretty neat if SPY opened at 447 tomorrow tbh
$CGC at $20 tomorrow morning. God, I'm using my one time
That's quite the leap.
RIP NFLX put holders
Righteous SPY dick swing into close

[deleted]
Blah I am in the final week at my job and I keep missing my EoD sell opportunity because I'm busy off boarding work load to people.  😤

“i will not fomo into sdc, i will not fomo into sdc” *hammers sdc 3de calls at close*
BB
I feel like everyone here overreacts to earnings movements 3 mins after the bell. Especially how NFLX moves. It literally does this every time, way up and way down, wait a few hours and it'll shake out.
Netflix Posts Q3 Revenue of $7.48 Billion, vs. Street Consensus of $7.48 Billion; EPS at $3.19 vs. Expectations of $2.56 Per Share

Well when the name of your profession has "pun" in it you're already in a losing battle. Pundit just sounds retarded
Lots of words here, but to summarize: Pnd
[deleted]
Who
Didn't they just start delivering cars? If that's real, looks like a duck and acts like a duck...
They‚Äôre trying to start with the same model. TSLA started with an expensive roadster over a decade ago to raise capital. LCID is already worth damn near 60B and hasn‚Äôt even delivered a car yet. Execution risk is much higher than it was with TSLA even early on
Skillz
Financial-media pundits literally retarded
Wtf
Pnd
if you win a Ban Bet visualmod should unban the last 5 retards that lost. it's a bit of a one-sided bet rn

[deleted]
Daily thread isn't pinned today and all the other WSB members can't be bothered to use the search feature lol
:(
My life has no purpose for me because all I wanted out of life was to find a really great girl that cares about me as much as I care about her and instead I found out females don't really care that much.

This obviously gives me the urge to just let humanity go extinct, but since we're the only known intelligent lifeform and we've already destabilized the biosphere that contains \*checks notes* ALL KNOWN LIFE, we kinda have to stick around to clean up our messes.

So despite my life having no purpose for me, it seems it has a purpose for everyone else, which is that I'm here to try to lead people through the crisis they've created and find some way to avoid extinction. Mainly gotta try to stop people from nuking each other, I think, so that some of us can probably survive the famine and find a scientific solution for the atmosphere. Hence my username and my constant efforts to raise awareness about the issue of nuclear war.

I am indeed running for public office but not until 2036, if elections still exist by then. Either way, more importantly I'm saving up for a robot army that can solve the issue much more effectively than public office. 

Anyway, do you recycle? Or do you just put recyclable shit in a recycling bin and never find out where it actually goes? Because if you actually handle your own recycling then great, you're one of those few people who actually tries your best and I was wrong to call you my enemy. But if you just send your shit to go get co-mingled into the same landfill as your trash, and you call that recycling, shut the fuck up and deep throat my dick. 

But guess what? You don't have to be a political figure or anything to just try your best. I've at least established a home on sustainable land where I help out with the farm when I can and I keep helping improve the property to prepare for what's to come. Thanks to me I have a pretty clear idea of how me and my loved ones can survive everything short of bunker time and I'm still working on something for bunker time. One year ago, I had no idea how I would survive grocery stores running out of food, and neither did any of my loved ones. These resources are available to us now and I have this connection with a farm and live on it now because of my effort and choices.

Simply trying to live sustainably enough to survive is me taking responsibility for my survival and trying my best to avoid extinction at the simplest individual scale. Until I can build my robot army, that's as far as I can really hope to go meeting my survival responsibilities as an individual. Have you even done that? Have you even got a clear idea of how you're going to be keeping YOURSELF alive, let alone your loved ones, without draining resources that other, smarter, more responsible people prepared while you were jerking off about how you recycle? 

If I have a vastly inflated sense of myself and no realistic conception of the world, that's wonderful. I can only hope I'll meet a really nice girl who was looking for a guy that cares as much as me and we'll start a family and get old together while agriculture just keeps working fine and the weather somehow gets under control. Too bad that's not going to happen.
Just watch and see. Ill even make a ban bet if I knew how to work that thing

Anyone read that Bloomberg piece on some Korean that owns 6.31 million Tesla shares and is now a billionaire‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the only TSLA share gain poor I will accept here now. Otherwise, you‚Äôre a bitch and still poor
Aren't looking too expensive right now so probably a deep ITM strike price... They have earnings on the 11th so I think I was looking at some expiry dates of the 12th
I 1.5x my puts over earning in that stock. Too bad I lost the gains with my AAPL puts. Shit was fucked, that villain Cook says they lost billions and chip shortages may persist through q4 but stonks only go up.

Well, when a clam loves another clam they have to open up to each other. Since they live in the water, their excrement tends to just mix around in the stuff they "breathe" and they don't really have control over their excretions. Mix that randomly happening during coupling and you have a recipe for some "associations" that tend to happen. I'm not really a clam, but when I rubbed one on my dick the other day, I happened to poop and...well I'm into it.

I have the deal of a lifetime that will pay off your mortgage. We all know DWAC is a terrible equity and ü•≠ is the devil, so buying puts on DWAC is the obvious play. But they are expensive, so you should buy the cheap ones and get more of them since we all know DWAC is going down. Say maybe buying the November 5, 40p for .75, that's a great idea, and what a lucky man you are because I'm selling them right now for .60 a pop, what a deal, free money! You interested?
The only Palantir in LOTR was linked to Mordor, as Sauron had its twin. Then again, it was used against him to focus his attention away from Frodo and Sam, but that's less about leading any charge through the gates and more about using it to create disinformation against its users. Kind of a mixed bag if you think about it.

American consumers tend toward ownership rather than renting allotments of  time with technology, although there are exceptions to the rule. The vast majority of the country is still relatively rural, and it‚Äôs not feasible for a fleet of Uber cars to replace your need for vehicles when you live even 10 miles from the closest town. Self-driving rentals serve great utility in the big metropolitan pockets of the country, but it‚Äôs easy to look at that dataset and be blindsided and not recognize that it‚Äôs just not feasible for rental cars to replace the need for personal transportation for at least two decades, and that‚Äôs assuming we have great progress on infrastructure for the next 20 years. And you‚Äôre arguing that boomers falling out of the market for cars is gonna be a significant effect? That effect will be negligible compared to expected population growth over the next 20 years.

TSLA will have the tech, Uber will use their tech, to ferry people around. Their issue was obtaining and servicing a fleet profitably. That's why the hertz partnership is meaningful. They do that.

I know this argument has been around a while, but the closer the UBERs of the world come to possessing a fleet of autonomous / self driving capable vehicles, demand for personal vehicles of all types in the US (and china) should fall precipitously, especially as the boomers start driving (and buying) many fewer vehicles. 

probably still on the horizon, but articles like this are bearish for TSLA, how could they not be?

I thought it'd be really flexible, like you learn a bit of everything... Mainly steel and aluminium things that move, but it combines electrical type stuff in mechatronics, structural stuff with civil, and even combustion and whatnot with chemical.

I just feel like we're interacting more and more with the digital world, and less with the physical.... So less need to design physical things, not to mention the physical things have been around longer so there's more copy and paste available and less designing needed. It's still necessary, but even a small decrease in available jobs results in finding a job difficult since you're competing with the laid off people with 10 years more experience than you.

If you like the physical world, then at least do civil, it's more stable, a lot of government work.
If DIS goes above 176 tomorrow I‚Äôll adopt an ape like we were doing on here in January lol
Well... shit

Only reason I don't want the Astros to win is cus they eliminated my White Sox but I don't want the Brewers getting that credit!

You guys are right, DWAC is a terrible equity. So terrible that you should buy puts, the cheap ones so you can buy lots of them. Say Nov 5, 40p for .75 each. As it just so happens, I have a bunch of them if you want to buy them ü§°

It‚Äôs so weird winning/losing in minutes what it takes weeks/months to make at a job.
Very interested to see results of IBM/Kyndryl spin-off.. have been gobbling up even more IBM shares the past week.. you‚Äôre getting 1 kyndryl at like 30/share for every IBM.. but it seems likely both stocks will see upward trends afterwards.. IBM for shedding debt, being slimmer and more forward focused.. Kyndryl simply because it‚Äôs going to debut at 75% of book value..

Holding IBM longterm .. but hoping for quick flip off the spin-off shares.

This will def be a learning experience for me .. but if IBM was able to shed debt at 40+/share valuation and it debuts at 30.. something has to give, right? They either dumped debt at a discount to pay for the past year‚Äôs+ M&amp;A spree (much of which was done during pandemic or pre-hyper inflation) or Kyndryl has to ramp up after spin-off is complete to book value..
It‚Äôs not fun or funny.
Big hiring spree or what?
If you have to ask then you fucked bro.  Been married 15 years and just turned 40.  We fuck each other even now 4-6 times a week and others sprinkled in because we are now open.  In our twenties it was multiple times a day everyday she wasn't on the rag and that didn't even matter sometimes.

Haha wtf does GDP or economy have to do with the market? The past 5000 years of thinking we had to be productive in order to profit was mankind's greatest folly. We made more money sitting on our asses last year, so why not take it to the logical conclusion and take GDP to -100%? Infinite QE = infinite profit!!!

At least a few times a week, but my longest relationship is only barely 4 years and we where 20 when we broke up. Sex is an important part of a relationship, but I think many other factors also matter when you're almost 30 and looking to start a family.

I don‚Äôt see why 4 years in should be any different than any other normal point. I know me personally I‚Äôd like a couple times a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

&gt; I think you kind of answered your own question.
&gt; I know that the company is environmentally friendly. I also know that it has a market cap of $2 billion and trades at over 100 times earnings.
Really,  no reason?
100k order from Hertz with another 100k possibly on deck.  
1 trillion market cap momentum.
Gas prices surging. 
Bitcoin surging. 
HQ move to Texas.

I'm sure I'm missing some....
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
That‚Äôs what they want the picture to be but remember everyone got stimulus dollars and not adjusted for income or anything. 


And then the business owners got the payroll loans or whatever they were. 


The wealthier got the billions of actual monetary injection into the stock market directly. 


So everyone got some benefits but the top got the indirect benefits which caused runaway inflation which hurts the bottom.

I was told raising interest rates, tapering, higher 10 year yield, inflation, etc would hurt the market but the market just keeps going up. 

Lesson is to never listen to anything bears have to say. Market is on a forever bull run. We can go for another 200 years and there will still be bears saying market gonna crash soon.
If I open a bank and call it Bank of Earth wouldn‚Äôt it automatically have a larger market cap than Bank of America?

Just a bunch of fake friends out there who pretend they‚Äôre besties. You‚Äôre better off without them homie. People are annoying.
it seems like all the Brrrr went to lower income though. Record savings rates, great wages for the bottom. Inflation is real. What is also real is unlike QE post 2008 crash, where printer BRRRR and the Fed GAVE THE MONEY TO THE BANKS WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO LEND IT TO US....they kept it, let us lose our houses while they shorted housing. Then, they bought the houses at 90% off. That was a true recession with people hurting. This time Printer went BRRR and the masses got the money. Big difference

Oats and shit at 5-10yr high. Guy posted pork at highs. Beef is high. 


It‚Äôs inflation and supply chains and Corona induced for all of it. 


Way I see it is partially this sequence: Corona slows production and transport, printer brr, lots of money, crazy inflation starts in hard assets and stock market, inflation creeps to commodities, people don‚Äôt want to work / want more money (wages), goods/services go up even more, inflation goes up because of that and is cycling around a bit. 


Biden solution: let‚Äôs pump $3 trillion! 


Ya sure I mean it‚Äôs good. Lots of stuff needs to be done. But everybody should be aware that the bottom 50% or whatever are going to be destroyed by this shit. They were already going to have lives of near poverty. No hard assets. Just work till you die. Now they‚Äôll be eating no meat for better or worse, probably have to combine living to afford rents, etc.

unfortunatey half my portfolio is in DKNG and i want to shoot myself.
Same way the government buys things....massive amounts of debt with no regard for the consequences.  It's the only way to live.
Litterally why?
The modern-day mystic and Jesuit priest Anthony de Mello once said: ‚ÄúEnlightenment is absolute cooperation with the inevitable.‚Äù This statement struck a deep chord within me. It seems to me that what he meant was to be absolutely open to life as it is.

Think about the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean that flows from the tip of Florida up along the eastern seaboard. If you were to put a straw in the water, aligned with the Gulf Stream, it would move with the flow of water. The water moves through it and carries it along on the current. Everything is aligned; it‚Äôs total grace. Now, if it‚Äôs misaligned, and it‚Äôs not moving with the flow of water, it gets spun around and moves off course.

Aligning ourselves with the flow of aliveness is an essential part of our mindfulness practice. Like the straw, if we move out of alignment, we‚Äôre moving away, spinning about, in reaction‚Ä¶in some way unable to be one with the flow of grace.  So we seek to stay aligned, letting the flow of life move through us.

What are some ways that we remove ourselves from the channel through which our life flows?

I noticed this happening the other day when I was driving home. I have my own accustomed speed, and the person in front of me was going much, much, much slower.  You know what that is like, don‚Äôt you? Now, I wasn‚Äôt in a rush to get somewhere. I wasn‚Äôt on my way to the airport to catch a plane, but it didn‚Äôt matter. I was driving at a speed that felt really different from my preferred speed. I was experiencing impatience and anxiety, and it was building. Everything in me was leaning forward. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt be okay unless the situation changed.

So I paused, mentally. I recognized that I had a demand that something be different than it was at the moment, and I tried to let go of it. This example is a small thing, but this happens in many ways, some small and some much larger, in our human experience. We get caught in feeling that happiness is not possible unless things change. Consequently, we cause ourselves tremendous unhappiness, because we‚Äôre demanding that things be different.

It‚Äôs interesting to notice how this happens. I think it arises from our social conditioning about what brings happiness. We are led to believe that we need certain things to be happy: ‚ÄúIf I can get this job,‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf I can earn this much money,‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf I can buy a house in that neighborhood,‚Äù then I will be happy. Or we might think, if only I were healthier, or thinner, or if my boss quit so I could have a different boss, or if I had a different spouse‚Ä¶and on and on.

We wait for things to be different in order to feel okay with life. As long as we keep attaching our happiness to the external events of our lives, which are ever changing, we‚Äôll always be left waiting for it.

What if we were to pause and align ourselves with the current?

What if we moved with the flow of what is?

What would that mean for you in your life, right now?

Aligning with what is here is a way of practicing presence. It allows us to respond to our world with creativity and compassion.

What is actually happening is that we‚Äôre opening to the universal intelligence, the universal love that can flow through us when we‚Äôre aligned. When the straw is aligned with the current, the Gulf Stream flows through it.  When we‚Äôre aligned with the flow of our lives, there‚Äôs a universal wisdom and love that flows through us, which is our true nature.

Rubber band experiment: If you pull it too hard it snaps and hits you in the face, you have to let go at the sweet spot, JPow is a smart man not smarter than Can/EU/Aus/Japan central bankers, when you go from 2200 to 4600 in SPX in less than 19 months its time to stop the Brrr.

Affirm has no late fees, but charges interest to consumers, though it only approves customers for the amount they‚Äôre looking to purchase on their terms, which they can choose to pay off over three, six, or 12 months, and they are only charged interest on the principle amount (**no compounding of interest over time as is common with credit cards when not paid off in full.**) Affirm does note that making late payments can affect a consumer‚Äôs ability to get future loans.

AFRM will def be worth more next year, even after the run

They could afford to pay higher wages without upping prices. I used to run a domino's and they turn 10-15% profit when run well. Franchisees just won't take that hit on their bottom line, even tho it'll pay itself when you're the only one running 30 minute delivery times.

Our records show that starting on November 15th, you will be designated as a professional trader based on having placed over 400 orders in listed options per day during the months of August and September.

Professional Customers are defined as individuals who place more than 400 orders in listed options per day on average during a calendar month.  Individuals who trade into Professional Customer status in a given quarter must be designated as such for the following calendar quarter.

**At this time, Robinhood does not support professional traders, so your account will be set to Position Closing Only for options for the following calendar quarter.** You can still trade equities, close any open options positions, or transfer them out via the ACAT process.

There is no top.
üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èHigher dividend payout ratios seem to predict higher growth, while lower payout ratios predict lower growth 

1Ô∏è‚É£Managers don‚Äôt like to cut dividends-

üìùif they are concerned about the sustainability of earnings in the future they would not offer a higher dividend today or raise it today

üìùA higher dividend *raise today* is a signal that they think future prospects look poor.

Thinking it's retarded to call McDonald's using technology to hurt people "neat" isn't wanting to stop the advancement of automation you fucking retard, it's wanting to stop regression, not advancement. 

You're doing insane mental gymnastics to try to convince yourself you're not a retarded piece of shit. If you care so much about not being a retarded piece of shit, have you considered... using your brain? You know, actually using it for its intended evolutionary purpose, instead of just using it as a delusion machine?

If you care so much about the advancement of automation why not have McDonald's and IBM use the development of automation to advance the state of the world instead of regressing it? They could dump massive amounts of money into vertical farming to save lives instead of killing people if they weren't retarded pieces of shit. And maybe if there weren't billions of other retarded pieces of shit supporting them, they wouldn't be retarded pieces of shit.

I don‚Äôt have any ridiculous beliefs that it will be good for me. The long run I‚Äôm talking about is probably beyond both of our lifetimes. If enough jobs become automated and governments don‚Äôt address it accordingly and start paying people UBI or something like that, it would almost certainly lead to horrible shit that obviously wouldn‚Äôt be good for me, but I‚Äôm optimistic enough about humans in general to believe that eventually we would come through the strife and work shit out and be better and healthier as a species. Maybe the long term results of that short term strife are shorter work weeks and more equitable living conditions for everybody, rather than just the elite and well off.

You‚Äôre over here talking about ‚Äúas good as possible‚Äù being on the table like there aren‚Äôt already people starving and being ignored by the government and there isn‚Äôt already unforgivable inequality across every nation. The status quo we‚Äôre at right now is already pretty fucking far from ‚Äúas good as it gets‚Äù and as far as I can tell we‚Äôre not exactly taking big steps toward fixing it. I don‚Äôt know why you think stopping the advancement of automation is going to help things get better, but whatever. You might want to read some history about times of rapid societal change.

Good luck with your unrealistic bullshit ideas and your psychotic namecalling. ‚Äúsubhuman‚Äù lmao. I don‚Äôt know how old you are but I would be shocked if you‚Äôre out of college yet with some of the shit you‚Äôve said so far.

All they need to do is announce the fines they will pay as a result / consequences and I think it should go back to where it should be trading in the mid to high teens. I own a few hundred shares because the service is good and it has no equal in China.

bears are all ready wrecked and you know that when Paul Tudor jones and all those other guys are seething mad. They can barely hide it any more. I don't think a 5% correction will help or even a 10%. They need a real crash and I think we will get death by a million cuts in 5% intervals

Blow off top. Shits gonna reverse at 4 am.
&gt; I don‚Äôt think whether it‚Äôs good or bad in the long term is irrelevant at all, and I guess that‚Äôs the big difference in our opinions here.

And you say that like it doesn't make you a piece of shit. 

Have fun finding out retards like you aren't the ones it turns out to be a good thing in the long run for. 

&gt; If you think that it was a bad thing on the whole just because it caused a time of serious societal unrest, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.

I think it was a bad thing on the whole because it's technology being misused by a population of shitty retards who aren't ready for such power and it may well lead to the extinction of the universe. 

But whether it's a good or bad thing on the whole is irrelevant since I'm not enough of a piece of shit to stop at "good except all the brutal killing" when "as good as possible" is still on the fucking table. If we get our shit together and avoid destroying the biosphere and somehow colonize the stars and all of this becomes a more arguably good thing that doesn't fucking make it OK that we had such unnecessary brutality on the path.

I don‚Äôt think whether it‚Äôs good or bad in the long term is irrelevant at all, and I guess that‚Äôs the big difference in our opinions here. All of those negative consequences you just listed were present during the industrial revolution too. Tons of people died and lost jobs and worked for horrible low wages for a time before things got better. But then things did get better, and easier, for humans as a whole, directly because of those advancements that allowed machines to do jobs that humans did before. If you think that it was a bad thing on the whole just because it caused a time of serious societal unrest, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.
I love it and I am not even that crazy about Tesla‚Äôs in general.

Fuck. I‚Äôll keep an eye out
I only own like 16 shares of each cause I‚Äôm poor, but I will gladly buy more when it dips again. 

I bought in right before the panic over the chip shortage started, then doubled down during the selloff. 

Then, I continued to buy during the regulatory drama.

Sold some positions, namely NET, waiting for a pullback. That motherfucker has the most retarded strength. Just can‚Äôt justify how propped up tech is, especially with tapering around the corner. Bullish on growth sector still just feel like these valuations are at least 6 months too early. Whatever. Hope you guys had a good Halloween.
What the fuck would you accept as proof retard? If you've lied to yourself every time you saw proof in the real world for years now when it's fucking 2021 why the fuck should I give you the benefit of the doubt that if I hold your hand through it you might be honest enough to accept anything I can show you over the internet as proof?
We're supposed to get a metric fuck ton of snow in Denver this week, so take that into consideration.

Ok, done.

Fair enough.  But I have noticed a big improvement in their ops management this month.  Their workforce is rebounding faster than others because they are offering better wages.

Fewer moving parts, quicker, cheaper.
Face it: whatever you eat at McDonald‚Äôs is going to be the same shit, so might as well be quicker and cheaper. Ditch the chicken and apples.
how so? I'm not keyed into the news but I figured SBUX is too big to fail

If you can't just stop farming without people noticing then why did you just say America's agriculture is fine? Sounds to me like pretending the problem is a labor shortage is working perfectly at distracting you from the actual problem dipshit

I just read about McDonalds selling their tech division to IBM so that IBM can make them an AI drive-through with the goal of completely automating the ordering process and not having humans taking orders anymore. The article made it sound like a bad thing for customers, but I dunno. If it‚Äôs shitty and a pain in the ass to order through of course it will suck but I doubt they‚Äôd put it in widespread use if it wasn‚Äôt fine tuned. I think it‚Äôs neat

Saying ‚Äúusername checks out‚Äù or ‚Äúprofile checks out‚Äù means that the persons username/profile supports the comment that was said. If someone‚Äôs username was ‚ÄúI hate aliens‚Äù and then posted something about how aliens are awful then you could say that their ‚Äúusername checks out.‚Äù For you, you have tons of sexual content in your profile, hence ‚Äúprofile checks out‚Äù

Nice to see companies like MCD trying to innovate automation and actually eliminate jobs vs just complaining about the labor shortage.  As a shareholder automating as much as you can sounds so much better than actually raising wages.  Payroll tax, HR, Unemployment are not factors when you hire a 24/7 robot staff.

Not financial advice but you need to get that kid a Roth IRA immediately. Pay him to put his toys away if you have to, just put money away. Buy solid dividend funds with gains and then funnel the divies to the child. I'm not supposed to say this but we all know the grandaddy corn is your child's gold. Buy it and store it yourself.

CGC, a Canadian weed grower, is a faltering company. Internal conflict, negative net income, and horrible fundamentals are only the start of its problems. The biggest problem with the company, is the fact that the legal cannabis market has massive red-tape around expansion to new markets, each with its own regulatory maze, resulting in incredible costs for expansion. Unfortunately for our friends at CGC, their corporate strategy revolves around quickly seizing arising markets from recent legalization. Furthermore, their inflated stock price has been priced in from the assumption that they would be able to use their significant size to expand to newly legalized markets. Because of this, CGC has nowhere to go but down. The situation has gotten so bad that CGC gave up 38% of its stock to an alcohol company. All of these signs point to one sign: short CGC in the short term.

Oh, sorry, you must live in communist China, here in American most employers institute policies that allow employees to elevate themselves without any outside help, by simply having employees save for their own retirement.

LMAO notice how the WFP chief is now like *"okay let's chat about it in private Elon"* and is still avoiding the open &amp; transparent accounting issue. These food programs are corrupt to the core, the vast majority of the donated money ends up in their bonuses &amp; the middlemen's pockets and the hungry end up getting pennies on the dollar's worth of food (that's the best case scenario, most likely the UN employees will blackmail women and ask for sex against food, lots of stories exposing that).

How can I start an ETF that inverses ban bets
&gt; Electricians are in demand and can charge a lot. As far as "dead end", I mean yeah you'll be doing electrical work forever, but you could have your own company/contractor business or just do it on the side for extra cash.
Pretty volatile stock though. Considering how much it already fell recently I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be fine but still, I would be at least slightly nervous if it was my money
Historically November is a great month for stocks

$CLOV earnings 11/8.
I feel like November will be like September. First day green to throw off people then red all the way down
Tapering isn‚Äôt going to crash the markets or even cause a correction because we all know it‚Äôs coming and we‚Äôve seen how the algos react when tapering has been mentioned in the past. Nothing is stopping this clown market until they raise rates and that‚Äôs not happening until mid-2022 at the earliest.
Not at all, tradesmen are in high demand, and not many new people coming into the trades

Tesla will hit 1200 this week, then drop down to 1000 next week. I‚Äôm 69% sure of it.
Is being an electrician a dead end job? Would I make more money withdrawing my pension and investing in stocks and doing Uber on the side?
Could be a sell the news event but I got no clue. No one really seems to know how many cars where actually delivered and I think that has a big role to play in price action on Monday
FSR will moon this month. Thinking about picking up some calls a month out.

&gt; I'm not making anything up. If you want to take a 40% drop in 5 days, that's your choice. I never said it was the best option for everyone or even most people - there are other options available which may be better suited to some investors' risk profiles and/or have lower fees attached (although these tend to come with longer lockup periods).
I‚Äôm so scared of Lcid I took profits at $40 but bought only a little back in at 36 puts and calls and some shares üòÜ
Why are you making stuff up? The cheapest weekly option available, representing a 40% drop in 5 days, is going for 60 credit for 4000 in collateral.

InNOut has the best burger imo in terms of a clean fast food burger. it's fresh and cheap. very cheap for the quality. fries suck dick. Shake Shak has some decent burgers when you want an oily sack in your mouth, but I also love their crinkle cut fries. also crispy but some soft middle. they tried shoe string fries once based on popularity in the restaurant industry and went back a year later cuz shoe string fries suck dick, that being said. I dislike 5 guys fries because they are too soft for my liking, I love the flavor, but hate the texture, I like a crispy and soft interior jus like my ~~dicks~~. fries. also McDonalds usually solid.

Bulls won this weekend. Bears lost this weekend. Lol üåàüêª slaughtered this week
Please let our puts print
Ahh, but you forgot the third Stochastic line everyone forgets that indicates retail shorts. It's going up so you need to flip your number to 896 by Wednesday. Silly fool.

#ALL IN ON &gt;!sold!&lt; DWAC PUTS
that's weird cuz on my chart the versace sequence is fully engaged and the tri angular anti correctional formation is basically complete at this point which mean there's an 89 degree upward moving wedge and SPY should be at 698 by Wednesday at the latest.
Lol bears need a win. Been thinking of starting a charity to help feed those who bet against this retarded market
It will. Going on all in on my feb‚Äôs Monday if it averages me down

Thank god Elon isn‚Äôt a MSM shill.
A lot of movers on the market after hours last week. Most notable was MVST, watch premarket tomorrow...if it's climbing then it's gonna tank. If it's stagnant then it's gonna tank...if it's falling then it's gonna tank.
I'ma put all my moves on URMOM it's gonna be a wild ride but I'll ride it to the moon

Now we just need Elon to stfu tonight and we’ll be good.
Make no mistake, Warren Buffett lied to you: timing the market *definitely* beats time in the market.

It’s just that most of us have terrible timing.
That feeling of selling your AMZN and TSLA calls yesterday for a massive loss just to watch both stocks make giant comebacks.

Can I get a paper hands flair mods
Zillow let their AI run rampant and buy homes for 25% over the ask, and now they face $500 million + losses of money they just borrowed via bonds. 

So fukt
Fuck my IRA is up 500% in 3 weeks
It’s possible. We might be in a completely fraudulent system.
I whisper “I fuckin knew it” to myself at least 30x a day as I watch everything else on my watch list moon except whatever I’m currently in.
My port is cyclical. 

1. Lose everything on options
2. Back to basics, buy SPY shares
3. Bear market, SPY shares lose money/stay flat
4. Sell SPY shares at a loss, buy SPY puts
5. Instant Bull market, Lose everything on options
Investing advice 15 years ago: “Do your due diligence and research the company from financials to industry disruption and your investment will yield yearly double digit returns!”

Investing advice today: “BTFD fruitcup. Are you watching JPOW? He hasn’t stuttered once. Those FDs are gonna be 10 bangers by tomorrow morning retard!”

EDITED for America. Guess which word.
I literally have to shit post. At this point I dont know what else to do. I am so fucked.

Please send gambling helpline support. I am going to lose my house, if I dont get this back.

Sorry being a bear for a day has me in absolute fucking shambles. I am royally fucked.
Me: *leveraged to the tits*

Market: *Goes down 1.5%*

Me: I'm fighting for my fucking life right now
I still can’t get over the fact that Zillow’s AI kept outbidding real homebuyers for shitty houses with no resale value, leading to massive losses.

This is what happens when you’re so fucking cheap that you outsource jobs to AI, rather than offering decent wages to potential employees. 

They can choke on their red dildos.
Mods, gimme the gayest flair you got
Seriously though, to all the bears out there- You may have lost a ton of money today but that is not a reason to kill yourself. Shit goes on, you will make more money, and you will likely lose more money as well (you are here after all). PM me if you need to talk, I’d be happy to make fun of you for being so short sided and pathetic. Betting against America? Couldn’t be me.
if you invested $4000 in ATT 5 years ago your investment would be worth $2500 now
So Zillow is gonna lay off a bunch of workers because an AI bought too many houses?

Seems like a sustainable company
Jpow didn't see his shadow. 6 more weeks of tendies.
If tesla hits $2000 I’ll have sex with my wife
Some times I think that you guys are just kidding with these wife’s bf/cuck comments. Then I click on some of your profiles and you guys are legit posting in subreddits about wearing women’s panties.

I’m scared about how much TSLA goes up tomorrow. My portfolio might triple. I’m not ready to be a 100 thousandaire 😩😩
Powell: I'm absolutely shocked the Federal Reserve presidents have been making billions with stock trading.
#A good way to combat annoying ape shrills!

Make them banbet shit.  Hopefully, it will decrease their presence and we can get back to reading spy's song
now we're all trapped into constantly buying TSLA calls as a hedge against it running up to $5000/share and destroying the financial system
Well looks like I’m not paying rent this month
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/cat_modeler (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 440.0 when it was 454.02 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Serious question:

Is life worth living
Wsb poors are built fucking different. Like I’m not claiming I’m swimming in it but god damn the size of the balls you must have to only be able to put 4 figures in your account and yeet it into oblivion is something else.
oh look a 6 figure gain

\>hes a millionaire

\>7000 shares

\>Up 12%
Remember when Bam Margera used to beat up his Uncle Janet Yellen? Good shit.
I made 2 cents today trading options. First time.

So tomorrow i'm going out to see what car i'm buying
Bad month to sell covered calls
MY MISSION IS SIMPLE.

TO MAKE YOU MONEY
So tesla tomorrow 1300 ?
I may be early, but I’m also wrong
I can make $3,000 and then lose 500 and I'll be fixated on that $500 loss. I'll try to recover it then lose some more. It's a vicious cycle
[deleted]
fuck, just checked futes for the first time in weeks and was actually surprised to discover that they still don’t matter
The saddest part is...

I could have gone all in on GME at ATH, $483 

And still be down less than I am today
23, male, hobbies include selling for <50% loss and immediately regretting plays no matter how well planned. Low maintenance but startles easily. $20 obo.

Bill Gates would be worth $1.2 trillion if he still had his Microsoft shares.

Instead, he became best friends with Warren Buffett and decided to diversify his portfolio.

He is worth only $136 billion today.

Diversification is for pussies.
This market is only going to go up. SPY 500 end of year is real.
So is everyones robinhood ok? Cause i just got like 8k taken out after hrs

Edit: false alarm (was a glitch, thanks for the updates everyone)
Is anyone else’s robinhood acting up?
$tesla ripping ass tomorrow or what?
OCGN’s that hot girl you never thought you’d be with but only once she finally accepts you you realize it turns out she’s the fucking worst.
If Enron and Theranos were to IPO today after everyone knew they were frauds they would still each get a $500 billion valuation

Only thing I miss about smoking cigs is that feeling of slipping out the backdoor of a loud bar or house party and the sudden silence feeling orgasmic on your ears and you light up and get that amazing head rush of nicotine that perfectly enhances your drunken state

When you buy a weekly for 5k and 25 seconds later its down 68%🤷‍♂️
Will Zillow keep dumping?

About 4 years ago I got a concussion at work. Stayed home for a few days. Went on a blacked out 23 hour online poker bender and went up 10k from  $200 “bonus” money. Lost it all in the 24th hour. 

I’m glad I could finally tell that to someone.
Tesla casually up $40bn in premarket. That’s 10* the size of the Hertz order.. in the ducking premarket.. in one goddamn day

I work in marketing but I think 99% of modern-day marketing makes no actual difference, most of the jobs involved with it are made up of total bullshit, and the world would be a better place if the industry disappeared completely. SPY 500 EOY so I can quit my job.
How retarted ark can be.

AND THEY ARE STILL DOWN YTD
Last time Tesla stock split at $1374.

I’m going to do something fucking crazy: I’m going to buy some profitable companies for a change.

/u/bumberhoots (1/2) made a bet that FB would go to 233.0 when it was 327.995 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Losing money in this market is impressive. Impressive like weighing 400lbs. It takes real effort.
I’m getting real sick of not being a millionaire.  Give me Tendies or give me Death!!!!
Wait, Cathie bought 288,813 shares of Zillow yesterday and sold 2,858,268 shares of it today? lol
Remember when we were pissed at Elon lol
I just read a comment... It said i want something good to die for, to make it beautiful to live. These words hit me. Not long ago i lost 98 percent of my acc... but i feel like this comment is telling me not everything is over till its over. That 3 percent is gonna pull me some good stuff.
We are gonna be so green tomorrow
Cathie Woods bought Z yesterday then sold it today. That some next level degenerate shit

I have such a bad addiction to this shit that I can lose 10k and shake it off like all I did was buy a loaf of bread.

Going to hit $1500 next week for sure, maybe $2000 before end of the year

After seeing BBBY and CAR this week I decided to buy a single way OTM lotto ticket on a bunch of stocks with earnings in the next two weeks.  No call cost more then $20 and if I lose I lose.  If I hit even a single one I should make up for all of them.  CPNG, DIS, RBLX, ROOT, SOFI, SPCE,  TME, and UBER were todays picks.  Heres hoping one does something really stupid and goes up 50%.

Okay you austists, who made over 500% on their OCGN options by buying the 10$ strike last week like I told them. Don't worry if u missed out on OCGN cause I got the next Biopharmaceutical play for you that will make you rich. ETON getting FDA Approval Friday, this company will be 10+ on friday once they got the approval. How am I certain they will get FDA approval is that they delayed it 3 months from August to November so that they could submit all the information necessary to the FDA, this is exactly what happened with CCXI which I had posted about a month ago. They are getting FDA approval for Topiramate Oral Solution which would have a huge market cap of 800 million and it will be the first liquid solution. THE VOLUME IS 4x its daily volume with 900k shares traded today compared to its usual volume of 250k. Last chance to buy in tomorrow before FDA APPROVAL FRIDAY

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again-

Gambling is why we are here. But when you gamble you know the odds and the rules of the game. (Mostly- I still don’t understand craps but I’ll lose money on it anyway)

Point is this- don’t fuck around with Chinese stocks.  They have no rules. The Chinese government is also instituting some new Jack Ma rules to keep companies from getting too strong. A Chinese company gets too big and the government will knock it down. 

Don’t fuck around with Chinese stocks.  (And you aren’t even really buying their stocks since foreigners can’t own Chinese stock directly). 

You’re buying promise rings from virgins who haven’t figured out their sexuality while their ultra religious father tries to send them to straight camp.

medium brain: TSLA is absurdly overvalued. Buy puts

galaxy brain: TSLA calls are the mechanism by which active investors will steal a decades worth of returns from passive investors and crash the global financial system. Buy calls
Cramer Last Night: SELL QCOM...Get rid of it quick...in morning or whenever get rid of it before earnings are released. You saw what happened to INTC....chip shortage crisis is a fiasco, nothing good can come of out it, earnings will be weak, guidance will be soft, just SELL it now!

Cramer Tonight: If you paid attention to me yesterday....you would've understood 3 things about QCOM 1) HOLD 2) BUY & HOLD 3) HOLD & BUY MORE....I told you earnings are going to be solid and strong, and the stock is highly likely to rally intra-day into earnings and after earnings are released. DON'T EVER DOUBT ME!!!!

Okay so now that the taper situation is out of the way, there's literally nothing to be scared about for a while right? So like spy 470 eow is possible
FED basically said fak berss
NVDA to 300 Eow
I wish Jerome Powell was my dad
Green as shite tmrw

If you have ever waited tables you only think you know what it's like to hate customers... wait until you get into Healthcare
When you call TD Ameritrade trading desk, they now have an automated message saying that margin calls are not negotiable in these times of increased market volatility 😂

always good for a chuckle
We're approaching time-wasting levels that shouldn't be possible

How is u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR bot going to make the daily thread posts after he gets banned on his TSLA bet. 14 hrs and bye bye 🌈🐻
Good Morning Everyone
Guess I should have held onto that Tesla call. Ha. Crazy
The fuck…nice surprise waking up to see my TSLA 1280 calls looking good this morning. Lfg!
It has been a pleasure to run with you bulls. Cashed out for the year, account almost at 200k. I am about to start my vacation from tomorrow going up through California into Yosemite, then into Arizona and Utah for the next 20 days. All paid by SPY calls.

Bul gang 4 lyfe
Lesson learned today:

Never bet against America. You will be ass-blasted.

If you think being a bear for a day is cool like me. Just sign up to lose money. 

Fuck my life.
Hoping that Elon doesn't tweet until I can at least take profits
Honestly fucking kill me
RIP **ROKU**

Lower revenue guidance

Missed revenue

Lower active accounts

Gonna get worse
That's it. SPY only goes up now, bears.
  
We once had an important place in the market. The Yan to Ying.
  
But those days are over. The market only goes up now.
  
The market is more like a bank account with variable interest now, that's all. It only goes up unless you take your money out. Some days more than others, but always up, nonetheless. 
  
It's a new phase in global economics. Adapt or die, as always.
  
Well done.
Bagholding OCGN thats what my move is tomorrow
WSB is a jungle, a mixture of things amazing to witness, full of wonder but also comically dark and depressing. What a time to be alive. Spy to 500.
FSLY gonna really do everyone dirty and be flat?
Don’t trade weeklies, you’ll lose your sanity.
OCGN $1 By morning apparently
I hit an ATH today. noice
Spy hitting 466 tomorrow?
Is this SPY rally historic yet?
\>France reports more than 10,000 new COVID cases for 1st time in two months

things might lock down again, which means SPY 500 for the re-reopening play? 🤔
Years ago after getting burned on weeklies, I said I would never trade them again. Well, here I am in the same position again...
When I make stupid plays and lose money I come in here to feel better about myself.  There's some type of special people in here that make me feel like I'm not the dumbest kid in class...  Thanks 🙏
NO ONE USES FUCKIN ROKU

LAST NIGHT I USED ROKU WAS AT AND A CRACK PARTY 5 MONTHS PITERALLY AGO
🎅 rally + JPOW = 🚀 🌝
Imagine posting a strategy to short TSLA and inadvertently triggering the greatest mother of all short squeezes in history.
Remember AH is fake unless you’re winning
If you’re not losing money, you’re not trying.
Who's a good boy? $TSLA of course is a good boy ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|hug)
$SPY $466 tomorrow 🤑🤑

If you think the market waits for the news to release before pricing it in you're unironically retarded.
I bought some TSLA $1300c weeklies as a lark. Figured it was some good gambling fun 

The fact that there’s now an outside shot they go ITM is fucking insane.
It's one thing to think that TSLA is overvalued as fuck, but it's another thing to think that puts on TSLA is a great idea.

Zillow you better be at $60 when I wake up you POS
Cathy dumping all her zillow shares...buying high selling low.

Feeling good, feeling blessed. Another chill day tomorrow and I will just sit on my ITM calls. Congrats to anyone who made a lot off of J Pow’s speech today!
Day 3 of no nut november, mental clarity diminishing, health in rapid decline, no appetite, expectation to succeed has all but died
Tapering = whole lot of nothing burger
I have an idea to combat inflation. Just put your life savings in spy leaps and once the tapering starts withdraw your gains. Am genius tbh
Fed announces tapering -> spy goes up; WHO announces EUL -> OCGN tanks
If Tesla goes to 1275 tomm my account can be redeemed
Last quarter AMC increased revenue 2,500% Y/Y.  If they can continue to grow revenue at that rate for the next decade I think they have a realistic chance of becoming profitable.
Cathie sold 2.8 million shares of Z today after buying 280,000 shares yesterday 🤪
“The Beach” with Leonardo DiCuckrio was so good for the first half. Why’d they have to make the second half so lame I loved that movie

#JPOWs first question and answer today:


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

"Will you raise rates twice in 2022?"

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

"I would say it this way we try to focus on what we can control and that is how to communicate as clearly as possible in this highly uncertain world how we're thinking about the economic Outlook in the balance of risks and how policy will evolve in that case and also in the cases which are frequent where the economy evolves an unexpected ways so the focus at this meeting is on tapering asset purchases not on raising rates it is time to tapered substantial participation getting to your question or baseline expectation is that supply bottlenecks and shortages will persist well into next year and elevated inflation as well and then as the pandemic subsides supply chain bottle next will abate and job growth will move back up and has that happens inflation will decline from today's elevated levels of course the timing of that is highly uncertain but certainly we should see inflation moving down by the second or third quarter the time for lifting rates and beginning to remove accommodation will depend on the path of the economy we think we can be patient if a response is called for we will we will not be we will not hesitate so what I will tell you is we watching carefully to see whether the economy evolves in line with our expectations and policy will adapt appropriately and that's what I would say."
lost all my money in spy a cou0ple weeks ago. now that spy is going up im scared to get in

this shit can't go tits up right?
Remember when the latest dip was supposed to be the REAL start of the downturn.  Lmao
Today took 5 years off my life
Tomorrow's moves are aggressive emotionally charged trades
Im signing off for now.

imagine being an executive at Toyota. you work hard for the company for 25 years and you successfully create enough value for society to keep the stock going up at 7.4% each year. you feel a sense of accomplishment.

then this retard comes in from nowhere and launches like 5 companies in different sectors and overtakes your entire auto industry's worth every 3 weeks
We should tax the poor
What a day.
FSLY hit with the uno reverse card
If you fell for both the OCGN and WISH pump and dump, you belong here.
I may have lost a bunch of money on puts the last couple months but at least I haven’t had to get a lap band like all my siblings. Gotta look on the bright side and go on a run.
Lol just check my market open til now. -14k from today’s peak 🤡

"Tomorrow will be different!!!!  I'll get you 🐂!!!!"
AMD and QQQ calls baby
Coincidence all the 🦍 flairs are crying about OCGN losses together… I think not
Made OCGN gains, bought again after I sold at open cause of fomo, lost all OCGN gains

Who knew the market wanted taper so much? 🤷‍♂️
SPY-  $465c 11/5, $470c 11/21, $500c 12/31. 

🤡🐻🤡
bears, if you need your fix, all the shitcoins are mooning  rn and they always eventually lose like 99% 3 months later. literally free money if you know how to do it
Jesus, shorts have gotten absolutely demolished over the last 30 days
Note to WSB

When you see $5 mil+ buy orders on SPY on no news, you should buy too

Noticed that on Oct. 29th that’s when I yoloed calls
MARA, HUT, Googl, AMZN, MSFT, AMD, SQ, IWM 

I’m long with this tomorrow am I fucked?
It's the same old story on the sub. Basically every day "the crash starts tomorrow." Then it doesn't. Then it's "bulls are fuk, market too big." 

Bears thought today was the day it would all come true. Taper meant market crash, right? Printer not on anymore, right? 

Turns out the thesis was always wrong and the market can, indeed, continue going up. There will eventually be a correction or a crash, sure... but good luck figuring out when/how it'll happen. If that were easy, this game would have long been over.
The irrepairable damage the Fed has done to the market will be interesting to watch unfold lol
Tell me you have an account with Robinhood without telling me you have an account with Robinhood.
¡BanBet Robinhood to fucking 0 after this 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I actually loaded spy puts before close. 

I still think this was the top. If it is green tomorrow, well, congrats to all call buyers. And I will be looking for confortable ropes, especiallly around neck area...
I’m not gonna forget some of y’all going full memetard this morning
Why don’t I just buy weeklies on spy and qqq until millionaire?
Me starting investing: *"Gotta do my research, test the product or service for myself and see what they're really about. Let's look at some of the financials and dig into their earnings history....."*

Feelin retarded for not  holding on to SPY 444 now worth 2k
AMD going up tomorrow
Are you good at picking stonks 

or is it just inflation?
I fully expect spy to finish up .8% tomorrow as a minimum, which means tsla up 6% minimum
this is what i get for being a gay bear

Imagine working for zillow and one morning you are fired cuz their bot bought too many homes at high prices
Imagine owning company in a stock that’s about to go broke.
Yeah fuck that hey? Probably get a sick severance at least.
> I'm not going to get fired, I have a contract.
I'm a web dev. My nightmare is that one of my client's systems causes them to lose money because I forgot to do math properly.

By the way, I totally don't work for Zillow.
Account broke 40k resistance 👏
I remember hitting 40k was harder for me than hittjng 400k right after
Hitting break even has been my accounts resistance for ages
I'm only like $50 short from having even unrealized gains.  I'm still up $1900 in realized gains and it's only here and there that I hit on a stock for very modest gains.
I hit it today and instantly lost 10k recovered back to 38k 🥵🥵🥵
Cathie Wood is fucking retarded
She bought a shitload of Z yesterday and sold a shitload today at 25% discount? All in 1 day? Jesus
Sounds like what I did with LCID yesterday man I’m retarded
Looks like we should buy z then

Today my asshole roommate ate half my lunch, spilled his drink on the floor and didn't bother to clean it up, shat in the toilet without wiping or flushing, and had the tv blaring stupid ass cartoons all day. Toddlers are jerks. Have kids. It's great.

How do you know he didn’t wipe?

Do not miss that part of parenting. Once they are like 5 they are pretty cool though.
How does he eat ur lunch and u don’t do anything about it
Why are there so many OF girls lurkin here? No one here has money to spend on you. They’d rather buy 11/5 Tesla 2000c

?? Where are they exactly
My DMs are open 😎 21 single willing to travel.
Honestly if I was an onlyfans girl, I would hang around all these people perfectly willing to throw money places they may never see again. Can’t fault a good business model.
Those things sell like hot cakes man
Super disappointing when you press your face to a girls ass and it smells all clean. No sweaty butt sweat pheromone scent, her leggings all washed and smelling like detergent… 

I remember one time I was so let down that I told the girl straight up to not shower after her late night jog next time. She asked why and I said because I want to smell your natural scent on you. So the next time I went over, I met her at the park she jogged at and we walked to her place and I could sense her vulva radiating heat.. her black thong was so sweaty while I was pulling down her Lulu leggings and I took the deepest inhale ever she almost fell forward lmaooooooo

Bullish. Any time she sells there's another leg up.

I bet she is a proud member of club. She probably post in here about our wife’s boyfriends and laughs in her lambo.
OCGN pump and dahmp was real
Glad I stayed out

Fed chair talks about monetary policy, employment data, and how to view inflationary pressures.

Cathie probably bought **ROKU**. Count on it
She bought Z yesterday, so it would be in line
ROKU is one of arkk’s main holdings
Yea we going to 1300 by Friday somebody bought that tesla dip
Every company that reports earnings crashes regardless of whether they beat or miss.
Watch COIN moon baby
TSLA, AMD, F, WFC ?

Just to name a few
False. .01% of companies moon. You’ll 100% buy calls on the wrong one though.
When people are like "yeah just gonna hold until it goes back up"   

I feel like that demon from Hercules.  

*If* It goes back up
Let them have their hope
If is good...
Blows my mind how many people post "x" killed earnings why it go down? Literally every earnings season this happens. You're autistic, learn something.
*This time it will be different*
I can only learn things I want to
What an extreme disadvantage.
Might just fuck around and take out a fat call on COIN tomorrow and hold it through earnings 

Edit: you know what I meant
Thought coin earnings was next week?
Coin earnings tomorrow 🤡
Next tuesday -> even betterer
ROKU is broku.

Considering the 200-300 stocks we would conceivable choose from, the plays we can make for each to go up or down, that now leaves 600 decisions to choose from to be right, but also if you only make like $8 while everyone else seems to be making 1000s, that's also going to seem like a loss. So 1 out 600 and some wins are losses but all losses are losses. Nah you're good
Apple, msft, Google, Tesla all slightly down AH

Roku fell off a cliff on earnings AH

QQQ up AH

You can't explain that
Markets don't make logical sense anymore. Just going up along with inflation
700% gain this month on spy calls alone, 😩
Can’t tell if I’m dumb, ballsy, or genius for holding tsla still
Chill, im right here with ya and i don't consider myself a dumbass
Unfortunately for you then, I do consider myself a dumbass
Ballsy and genius! I'm extra fucking retarded and sold my weekly 1160c early this morning and put the gains into GME calls. I'm a fucking loser who will never learn 😣
how about all 3

Why is this guy such a bear?
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/A-SPAC_Rocky** bet **SPY** goes from **464.78** to **500.0** before **2022-01-02 17:37:40.289167-04:00**

I mean, I hope you’re right, but enjoy the time off probably lol
Guys don’t get banned. It literally sucks so fucking bad. I don’t have the greatest life but if there is one thing I look forward to every day it’s shitposting and venting in here.
You can still read the comments.
Yeah but then I’m the only person who can call me retarded. And I know most of the answers are shit but I still like bouncing ideas off you retards.
We’re here for you buddy. How was your day

She ain’t done I don’t think? Shall we see $466-$468 tomorrow?🥶💰🦍🥵
Then need to yolo on msft amd and nvda
Been in Niv for awhile, she don’t disappoint. Good luck my fellow tard!
Ya considering the weird monday this is a surprise but a welcome one to be sure.
Zillow fake bounce before close lol it’ll open red
Cathie bought tho…
Probably not, tbh. It’s down a lot and this is par for the course after a really shitty earnings and a nosedive of like 33% in a week: it’ll probably gain a couple percentage points until analyst reports pound it into a pulp again
Ok like stop making jokes now guys. What actually ARE your moves tomorrow?
See if spy will go up or down in the 30minutes my wifes bf lets me use the computer then trade accordingly
Yell at my positions when they have any downward movement but take no action.
Same as everyday: talk myself into buying more ROKU
Roku is screwing up in my opinion. Their whole appeal was that they were the only neutral streaming service that worked with all other companies. So while Amazon Fire and Google Chromecast competed with each other by not offering each other's services, Roku was simple and offered both with a cheap streaming stick. The only thing they wanted was to show you an ad on your homepage. They started licensing their OS for cheap/free to a bunch of other TV companies too like Google did with Android.

Then they bought Quibi and started pushing their own bottom tier streaming service. Then they started fighting with Google to the point where you can't get Youtube on a new Roku (you can keep it if you already downloaded it). If they would simply drop this new business venture and go back to their highly profitable basics (like Zillow is doing), they would be worth a lot more in my opinion. If they were smart, they'd create a single app that allowed you to search/browse all your streaming options at once from their homepage. If they do that, they'll make bank (by showing ads and acting as the gatekeeper to the streaming apps). Hopefully the price will crash a ton, they'll give up on this stuff, and I'll be able to buy shares before anyone realizes what they've done.
I still think it’s the best pure-play streaming stock and their revenue growth is impressive, but I agree on it being a big mistake for them to sacrifice their neutrality by investing too much in their own platform.

Love the idea of a single app doing that clearly.
> I still think it’s the best pure-play streaming stock and their revenue growth is impressive

I completely agree with you. The only catch is that their P/E ratio has been sky high, so everyone else agrees too. I'm hoping people sour on the stock due to short term sentiment so I can buy for a lower price.
Lol so dumb. Why would you buy this.
Serious answer: their earnings were not bad, and I think it’s oversold. 683MM revenue expectation to 680MM actual and they beat on the bottom line. 

Interestingly international expansion, and they have, time and time again, proven to do well against the presumptive roku-killers, AAPL, AMZN and CMCSA. 

Is it guaranteed to keep its market share? No. But it’s a pure play streaming play with more upside for success in streaming than more diversified companies.
The electric slide
Continue holding the spy calls that have currently netted me 200% profits in the past month, and are gonna be 300% profit by December 31
Stare at the charts go up and down. I’m already balls deep so there ain’t much buying to be had.
the moonwalk
I’m riding these z puts.  Hoping they print.  I need another 10% down day.
Anything that dips tbh. Selling puts on a fun unmentionable stock for long term accumulation. Hoping to dump LCID bags too.

I am starting to think I may not be good at guessing where stocks are going to go in short term intervals

Could have bought SPY options like I always do. Nope. Had to go all in on WSB's latest PnD OCGN. 80% loss.
Should’ve went bbby
SPY was the play

Today is an example of "buy the dip ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5958)". SPY going up after the meeting was so obvious.
Pour one out for Pier One. Just a few months away from the trading era where every dumpster fire gets a squeeze/dilution bailout if they're terrible enough
Holy fuck Zillow stop
I would like each of you here to slap me on the face, hard, if I ever mention buying puts again
Run naked and send that video retard

See you next week brother
i made a lot of money on calls and sold them and bought puts. im a dumbass
lmao they added Scary Movie 4 to Netflix
Ngl opening scene with Shaq and Dr. Phil is pretty funny
Tesla has been a money printer for the last month💦
I could easily see SPY at $470 by friday
If Spy hits 470 by end of week I'll get an appointment for my next tat
I’m not touching SPY puts till it hits $472
At this rate I’m afraid to ever touch them

RKLB 12/17 14-16c
I trust you
Oh yeah this is how you become poor
I’m already jacked on ASTR shares for their launch and SPCE shares because I’m an idiot. Should I diversify with a third pick in the same space?
Also want to throw it out there I have a decent amount of RKLB 12/17 22c for ath lotto, I see them breaking it this month which can give a lot of buffer room for re entry post launch.
I’d honestly bail on the SPCE and yeet it at UFO leaps/ RKLB December options then wait for sell the news oversold rsi on RKLB after nov satellite launch and throw down on some leaps a year and just keep rolling/ exercising. That’s my space game plan at least. SPCE is just such a pipe dream with no real mission statement there’s so many factors they’re so mediocre in within the field comparatively to all these niche companies that will culminate an immersive market with their own tech identity.
SPCE is ridiculous—I agree. But I have made a killing wheeling it and just got assigned on short puts, so back to selling calls. Options on this has been free money.

Kinda like the rolling LEAPS idea for RKLB. Will look more into the strat later
SPCE premium is fire no doubt I’m just dreading the day we inevitably see a correction that brings some sense of normalcy to valuations so the underlying scares me haha

Ofcouse it is!!
Is DIS waiting for the next season of mandalorian or some shit
I have shares at 170 and wondering the same thing. Lately it almost always goes up on earnings then sells back down… it seems like people are waiting for this next earnings but I bought shares expecting a run up…
Every guy should know their peak level. For me it’s day 2-3 after I shave. Slight stubble. Can’t pull off a beard so that’s my peak

Even though it’s probably hitting 1400 by end of month
You're too conservative

You may not have time, the run up will be real
I’ll watch it. Made a nice Chunk from 900-1100 but IV is pretty high now though 

We’ll see, I could dump it on AMD calls too 🧐

Sold my 11/5 TSLA call at open today for a GME call. PDT poor here became more poor bc he is stupid

 Best advice I’ve seen so far.
Pure retard market.  Start using your brain and thinking rational and you are down 50 percent.  Yolo on a random ticker and you are up 200 percent.
My value/dividend boomer account is way fucking up over the last month. Maybe you just suck at this.
I’m up on the year big.  Just had a bad week overthinking.  I’ve killed it on the dumbest plays all year though.  I’m not interested in some plus 20 percent boomer bull shit
My risky plays are all doing great, I was just saying the boomer shit that's usually considered the smart stuff is doing well too. 

You'll make it back. Just don't short in a bull market. Find good plays to long.
Tell me what the smart play is so I can inverse it
He's probably short CMG because the share price is so high
You are really hanging on to the idea your up cause your smart.  Get over it
Smart enough to know the difference between your and you're, at least
I let the autocorrect get it.  If it doesn’t get it then it doesn’t get it.  This is a WSB sub

The drug maker of that medication was successfully sued by a woman bc it made her excessively horny.

And speaking from experience taking the drug myself to combat trenbolone side effects, it makes you develop some weird fucking fetishes
That’s crazy. I didn’t mean any disrespect just hadn’t heard of it before. So the lady got fetishes of wearing women’s underwear and sucking dick, or you did, or both? Maybe that’s the needed clarification.
Those were my fetishes lol. But I used it to illustrate how excessively horny it can make you.
Nothing wrong with that. A ladies like undergarm can make a lad feel sexy 🤷‍♂️

Good luck cause the stock market is the equivalent to one punch man if you throw all your eggs in one basket
I’ve been sitting back all year since the meme stocks burned me and saved up. Today I initiated a 8k transfer to Robinhood so I could day trade. Either lambo or soup kitchen for me. Good luck brother. 🤝
I truly do not need million's...All I am looking for is being able to wake up in the mornings....make a couple of trades...go play some golf...IDGAF if its at a public course, a private club, or wherever the hell I can play. Go home to a home with a decent enough kitchen to make some nice meals and have friends over every now and then.

Maybe take 2 or 3 vacations a year...and im not talking going on a yacht to Europe...im talking going skiing and having to drive my ass there 20 hours each way, staying a hotel, and budgeting accordingly.....

IS THIS TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR.
Trust me, you'll need millions.
I think I could get by with $999,999...maybe even less....
Everything sounds good except the golf. Good luck playa
I only play drunk
It is in 2021, yeah.  You're about 40 years late sadly.
What? You don’t like the rat race?
Only the movie...only the movie...
Plenty of people dont work for a living.

They are either very rich or very poor.
Im currently in the very VERY poor category....nothing like debt.
That's entirely doable
yea that'd be pretty sweet
On my 7th year of this.  Doable.
How did you get there amigo?
Be debt free. A small mortgage on a condo only debt. No wife, no kids. Hard part is getting 400k or so in a cash account so you have to work and have an equal amount in a 401k or IRA.  That's enough to peace out.
Working on it.

Went from making 6 figures in my mid 20s to pissing it away due to mental health issues that led me to resign from my job....and this happened twice...im a fucking mess amigo.

Currently working my way back up in a different industry, but working on my mental health to make sure a repeat does not happen for a third time.

Through that, I put myself in a pickle of a pickle with debt, and now have to face that in order to put myself in a better position to achieve what you just described.

Truly hoping to put myself in a place where 4-5 years down the road I have enough cash on hand to continue work, and be a able to use that cash to have a side income, making that money work for me.


Doesn't help when I sit here through work and watch so many strike rich off options...

One can wish.
Take care of yourself. You have the ability to make six figures so the game is won just play it. Beware of the yolo's.  That isn't going to fix your problem.  Get yourself in a good place mentally and then you have the freedom to take risks. But only then. 

Work, max your 401k or IRA. Get in a good spot. 

For me I flamed out as an attorney, was drinking daily hated my life and had some depression issues.  I got through it.  

Feel free message me if you need to talk it out.
That is where my head is at currently, knowing and being aware that I am capable of making good money, I've just put myself in positions over and over again where stress and being overwhelmed have led me to shut down and back myself into a corner.

Definitely trying to get myself into a better spot with each day.

Depression and anxiety have been at the forefront of all my mistakes and issues, so I know addressing those will be the only way I can progress to where I want to be in the future once again.

I'm sorry to hear that you went through that, but sounds like you are able to reflect back and learned from it.

Appreciate the kind words, truly.
You have the tools you need and seem like a good soul.  Just work on it and I think it will work out for you.  Don't beat yourself up over past mistakes. Reach out if you need anything.

Who held calls?
I got stuck with no day trades, but I'm up 100% so I should still get out with something tomorrow
MEEE. SPY 470+
Wish I held my tesla spread but I unloaded for a loss start of day to buy other shit and it wasn't the worst idea given I'm up 100% on those calls.
SPY was red this morning, so you know I bought calls.

I was a millionaire for 2 secs
Turn that resistance into support.
Oh shit really? That’s awesome dude. On what ?
Just gonna need TSLA to go up $100 tomorrow. 

Is that possible in premarket?
In this market, it's possible for TSLA to go up $500 tomorrow.
I’m honestly under the impression that it’s expected tomorrow
Tsla can go up 7% in a day without thinking about Technicals, and it infuriates the bears.

It’s a win win
Keep going. I’m almost there….

PYPL 250 call EZ money after earnings
I’m loaded to the tits on $SKLZ. This movement is crazy.
bought calls before close, smash earnings and drops. awesome
Call is in an hour. I expect it to jump again. People taking profits.
I see that. I’ll be listening. You think this play works out?
Sold my spy 465 calls too early today 🤬
At least you didn’t buy 0dte puts 😔
Why do you buy puts on a graph that's been going straigh up for decades?
Where were you in 2008?
I can't imagine a catalyst to tank Tesla more than 10%
Just buy dips. Just like Spy.

Paperhanded my TSLA call for a lost this morning. Depression.
Dumped mine right before the run up. 😬
Great minds think alike. DW, let's use this to fuel our comeback season 🙏🙏🙏
Yeah lost $1970

Could of been up almost 3k
Man, this sub is so fucking comforting. Thanks for sharing bro.

It triggered my stop loss lol,

Oh well glad i never paperhand my tesla shares, only kept on adding
That stinks. I held strong throughout the day and sold 40 minutes too early. Should have held to close. got scared at that drop at 3:20 or so.  Left 1,700 bucks on the table. Could have had over a 10k gain. Still very happy
Damn bro, I feel that. Thanks for sharing. I could have to if I held my 1110c expiring next week, but I paperhanded that too lol...My thought was to cut my losses and fight another day.

But there will always be other opportunities bro. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)

'Want to become a millionaire? Follow Warren Buffetts 4 rules'
Why tf would I follow 4 rules that turn billionaires into millionaires?
They all have to do with asking your butler to pull you up by your bootstraps
Literally just buy spy calls, this market can not go down. No amount of bad news can shake this bull market. They could announce we're going to war with China and Russia and SPY would go +10%. They could announce the black plague is ravaging through the U.S. and SPY would go +10%.
The first is good for military contractors, the latter is good for healthcare profits. With ETFs the calculus has changed because you can just dump your money into one of thousands of funds that all shift resources around and help keep the other stocks up. The bond market's massive expansion has created a major risk offset and completely upended fundamentals analysis. 

The market will continue to go up until something seriously systemic will stop it.
You're a little slow if you're just realizing this
[deleted]
We've been saying that for how long? And SPY/market just continues to melt and gap up. We said the Fed sold the top? And that was $14 ago lol. This market cannot be stopped.

War is good for the economy and another plague will make tech go up cause we will all be in lock down this all checks oot.
Why tf cAthie bought zillow am i missing something
Cathy has a hat full of stock tickers for each fund that she randomly picks from everyday.
Underestimated the hedge funds ability to fuck over the retail investors. Good company? Solid earnings? Doesn’t mean shit anymore
Stonk go down when stonks only go up. Obviously a mistake. Buying opportunity
it's at a huge discount rn.
Kinda sketchy and I have poots so… but they are being investigated
Somewhere there is an inverse ARK fund, also with 10% TSLA. It’s doing well.
So Tweets from Elon have more bearing on the overall markets than the Fed does.  I’m starting to get it.  We just need to get poppa high again then we’ll have our correction.
how is NKLA still publicly traded
I don’t know bro. It’s fucking wild. I don’t even want to short it because it should’ve been dead by now.

*President Joe Biden said Tuesday that his administration will announce “fairly quickly” a nominee to chair the Federal Reserve, without specifying if he planned to renominate current chair, Jerome Powell.*
Wen
He said fairly quickly so that's like 3 Biden years
It will be Powell. If it was going to be someone else, they would have leaked the name to get a reaction.
Powell’s gonna keep his job. They’re gonna want a republican to blame if everything collapses.

Are you the real solitary egg?
Buying all the calls for earners this week. *Then* immediately losing money on those calls
So with tapering announced and the market deciding to take long acting viagra, I think good news is back to being good news.
Market hasn't thought long and hard yet. Tapering means slow drain on the only think propping up this disaster waiting to happen.
Weapons grade retardation right here and not the money making kind.
SPY looking like a Jet rn

All gas, no brake
Roku holds up there nicely. Main problem with that it was supply chain issue. It will bounce back like it did.

Of course some of you cunts never read and make comments from their pussies. Read and study your lesson.

Here is the summary

Roku (ROKU) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.06 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.09 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 700%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this video streaming company would post earnings of $0.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.52, delivering a surprise of 271.43%.
What not enough remotes small enough to fit in between peoples couch cushions?
The more serious issue is that they’re also in danger of losing Youtube and Amazon Prime. If the big boys collectively decide they no longer need Roku to succeed we could be in for a big problem.
I enjoy my roku soundbar, surround speakers, and subwoofer.
Thx AAPL, back to rice and beans for a month

You’d probably get the one for $0.27 cents but they put your odds at 1 in 100,000 for a $60,000 one lol
I don’t like those odds. I’ll just get pissy I only win 0.27 instead and it’ll ruin my day. Pass

Burger King is nasty 🤮

Burn it. Better than any other reply to this comment, garunteed.
Buy one of everything. Keep fastidious notes and keep everything in its original packaging. Purchase a warehouse to store your horde. Have everything organized by type and rarity. Eventually you will either have something extremely valuable to someone, or you will die being known as "that guy who has one of everything".  Worse decisions have been made.
pick a basket of pennystocks that are years out from revenue, but has a realistic roadmap and with time you believe has the potential to become ubiquitous

Oh shit. 

That far out? 

I been playing a week or two out lol 😂
Small position in the account, wish I had put on more. https://i.imgur.com/l5dMyDZ.jpg
Damn! Very nice. When did you buy? 

I only had 1400 in buying power when the week started. Everything else is locked up. I’ve been taking about half of it and playing SPY weeklys. 

Bought 3 SPY 11/10 462 on the 1st. Turned the 606 into 1230. got out at end of day.
I know SPY is boring, but she has been so good to me.  New ATH in AH.
Tf? Spy options are not boring. They may not be as big dicked as tesla options, sure, but they move pretty quick and you can make good money with em.
SoFI so strong
After seeing the financial "advice" they give to customers, I would disagree
I bet if I actively try to lose money I'd make money 🤔
Can’t do any worse.
you actually lose more money
This doesn’t work, just reverse yourself
Status check on the guy who took out a loan on his home to randomly buy puts at the beginning of the usual November rally and now thinks he’ll lose his wife to boot?

It still hasn’t even left earths atmosphere. Shits going to moon the likes of which the world has probably never seen before, believe me.
Probably yeah, cloudflare is a huge company, much bigger than people seem to realise. I just don't have that kind of money to invest in it anymore
We should have let the big banks fail during the financial crisis.

We would have been far better off today.

I remember the before times with boolean searches and altavista. Yahoo came and was good for a while, but intrusive ads and poor SEO caused spammy results. About a billion different search engines and metasearches came and went, but none changed a damn thing. We had metacrawler, dogpile, metaspider, ask jeeves, and so on. Then there was Google. It was clean, it gave incredible results, and dealt with the spam behind the scenes. It worked like no other that came before it, and killed most of the pretenders. When they announced they'd be advertising, we were all crushed, but they came up with a way that was unobtrusive and sleek. It didn't take away from the search results, and sometimes enhanced them. 


Most here don't remember or never experienced web 1.0. It was awful. There were scrolling marquees and flashing text everywhere. Style sheets weren't a thing and God forbid you wanted a navigation pane because that meant frames and scrollbars, but no layout was standardized. Even page to page on a single website was going to be a different layout. Google changed a lot of that; taming the wilds and civilizing the world wild wild web.

I'm here every night. I'm not sure what you're insinuating. My point is that the internet was shit before Google and nobody has come close to being as influential in its direction. Nobody bings or yahoo's anything. They Google it.

A lot of people saying they went bear for a day and now they’re fucked. Why did you guys go bear? This news was known. The only fear was them raising interest rates which there was 0% chance of.
I went bear for five minutes then went all in on calls right before they spoke, best decision I've made in a while
You are fucking right but the bull trap is on. 
No matter how long, it is definitely on.
My best guess is crash happening in two months. 
Let’s take the bet, WSB apes 🦧 !
We have a banbet. If you have a bet, make it.
Was up over 5k on gme. Held all the way back down...
Have faith
Bet he had options
Sure. Have faith a better move than that is coming and your profits weren’t worth it. So done with GME.

You realize that even if the hedge fund conspiracies are true, that this is how they’ll extricate themselves, yeah?

Let it die down, buy a bunch of shares, immediately sell. Bumps up above 200 and you all buy back in to hold their bags hoping for $1,000,000 a share lotto tickets when the game has already been mapped out. 

Rinse, repeat. 

That massive jump and immediate drop? THATS the hedge funds. The small inconsequential wiggly lines after? 

Yeah, that’s you.
It'll pay off.  Margin calls and moon way over $300 spartans
greed
I remember when I thought I could be just like michael burry with a few timely puts. Blew up my account. Good times. Kind of like an emo phase you go through but with options.
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

I once had a sleepover at a friends house as a kid and the fucker was so lazy to go to the bathroom that he rolled over in bed and pissed between the wall and bed. lol no bullshit
Ford is up higher than the ape stock the past month, and they don't need 6 different subreddits and 327 conspiracy theories to explain why.
Hedging my SPY puts by holding a fair amount of Ford is the only reason I haven't yolo'd into ROPE.
They don't need to track failures to deliver too ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Found the put holder, lol
Damn you don't know the meme cult enough to get the joke then, rip.
I know, nobody would bet against $F........and live to tell the tale. Lol
I’m sorry how’s the year to date on Ford vs ape stock? Btw on the 1 month they’re 2% different. On year to date it’s a different story
Taper priced in. Rate hike priced in. 100th covid variant priced in. SPY 600 next year!
Heat death of the universe? You guessed it, priced in.
🍻
why not 1000?

I'm going to start doing some of these leaps and long plays you guys talk about. Maybe 2 weeks out instead of 1.
Woah, bro, that’s a pretty long play there, might want to be careful with that.
I tried that once. Way less fun when you zero out on higher premiums

Fastly wtf
As someone who has been buying a lot of puts lately and just fully capitulated, I see a lot of other people expressing the same feelings. Isn’t this when the crash is supposed to happen, once all the bears capitulate?

Whatever. Buying calls anyway
another possible time for market to go down is around december, generally its when some people lock in gains etc, but theres the famous "santa" rally before eod, i used to not believe this boomer nonsense, but ive seen how "sell in may" is ingrained in their brain and also selling in September as well its like habitual for them
> This is the most common question I get.
didn't you hear powell? no crash..ever
thanks, we'll probably crash tomorrow
Holy crap everything you retards recommend goes tits up. Or are we the retarded ones for listening? 🤔

Edit: I take that back. Y’all are stand up and I’m a clown for doubting
> I'm done with this conversation.
sucks that my puts were wrong, but i decided the correct answer was to add more
lol at the guy who sold FASTLY before close
Glad I tilted into ROKU puts.
Sold my spy puts at -90% for calls on $ROPE
Bruh my 11/22 down like 50% but my calls for other doing hella good
Watch SPY drill tomorrow too just to salt the wound
$SKLZ beats up 5% now down 5% WTF IS GOING ON 😂😂
It’ll be back up tomorrow
Anyone else get this new green theme in their brokerage account? Looks much better than the old red one.
> I didn't get it. I'm not sure how to update my account
I think you just have to buy calls and you get the update automatically.
I need to stop with the puts
I would prefer to make money tomorrow, if possible. Thanks.
time to go long af. Futures long
I don't have the SKLZ to play this stonk trading game :'(
i bought a single roku put for $90. wonder what thatll be tomorrow
strike? I bought a single roku 270p for like 220, hoping I dont get IV crushed
You better hope that thi g has downward momentum tomorrow or IV CRUSH
So who is buying SPY calls tomorrow?
I buy SPY leaps every paycheck

Your boss did blo.. wait till he's all happy after railing a fat line and ask for a raise
Look I would totally understand a pump if jpow had said tapering wouldn't start until Dec or Jan, but why the hell is it bullish to start taper immediately?
No interest rates hike until 2022
Cause the taper is laughably small.
market was worried they would accelerate the taper or sound more hawkish on rates
Slow taper, no more uncertainty.
> It is not bullish to start taper immediately.

if I would’ve just held my original position this week and not paperhanded trades until I got marked PDT, I would’ve been 60%

Instead I’m down -30% and marked PDT. I’m so indecisive and retarded. Like, I *never* learn from my mistakes. This shit was on Margin too...

I didn’t short it over the last two years. I shorted it today.
That's ok.  I am sure it was a risk-appropriate amount and you will be back on top tomorrow.

BABA makes up 18% of his portfolio. Makes sense he’s trying to pump before earnings
What’s up with TLRY? Is it because I sold half of my stake yesterday? 😭
Honestly, my 20k loss this year can single handedly be attributed to spy options and Idk how to make it back. Edit-spy inverses me everytime- I buy calls-->spy dumps. I buy puts-->spy moons. What do?
Buy less puts and more calls
Spy options
Switch from puts to calls, check the trend on the 1y SMA trendlines before buying, and avoid buying calls on OpEx week. (Definitely buy them when the trend reverses to the upside.)
[deleted]
It's hard, spy always inverse me. I buy calls-->spy dumps. I buy puts-->spy moons.
Sounds like you’re the special kind of retard that buys puts on the dip and calls at the top of the rip. Time to quit the market.

One day I wanna try not buying SPY options right at 9:30
Not doing anything till after 11:30 is usually the play
It’s tough though because if you just guess the right direction and but the appropriate option at 9:30, you can nab some serious gains in 30 minutes
Yeah I’ve got serious fomo right at 9:30 but find that the safer way to determine trend and protect capital but still getting gains is to wait. The market loves to go red to green and vice versa lately.
What?? The first hour of volatility is excellent to trade if you know what you’re doing.
Not really - premiums are generally overpriced at that time.
>not doing anything till after 11:30

I’m saying selling into the morning pump, or scalping and therefore not suffering from the IV crush by buying early and holding.
girlfriend got mad at me because im going on a trip with family during thanksgiving
Clinger bro get out of that one. She wants control.

She wants to create traditions with you and not be alone. I get it. But she shouldn’t be making you feel like she’s mad at you about it
Send her pics and caption it "thinking of you" every 3 hrs.
Did you explain that she is but one of many past and future gashes, and they are your only family?

That's I only date second cousins or closer.
Good she should be you selfish fuck. It’s okay she will get on tinder
And we should care why!?
Lots of money to make in this indefinite artificial pump.

Issue is though that low incomes can't get in because it's been moving up too fast, they'd help make this go higher of they could.

I mean they would have to get on SPY options 7-10 notches from the money hoping for 10% moves in a week. Even then they only make $200 or so.
Did you just come up from the basement for Mt.Dew or nah?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Done can day trade SPY options 2 strikes OTM 5g7 days out. They're under $200 and you an make an easy 25%, sometimes even 100% if you get lucky. That's how I started out trading with just a few hundred bucks.
Yeah, I make safe gains buying long dated OTM SPY calls that cost 1500 in premium per contract so it ain’t for everyone.
you can buy fractional shares, fds, etc. nothing to stop you from putting every penny in.
i’m buying puts on every company’s earnings now. i get fucked every time i buy calls
Cheat code. Wait for the ones that are actually decent companies to shit the earnings bed and buy options for when the stock rebounds.

Good luck Xi, you’re fucked
As the US becomes more ~~socialist~~ socially aware, with wage supplements and incentives for manufacturers to bring it back home, I am bullish for the future.
Eh we are the Human Resources department of the world, let others make shit.

🇨🇳 🐻 havent seen this kind in …. 3 hrs
are tech calls a month or two out/leaps on dips the cheat code to generating wealth quick? seems like it can’t go wrong
> I wouldn’t recommend it. The market is volatile and things happen that you can’t predict, like the recent flash crash on Bitmex.
what do you recommend, sir?
Just play nonstop 0dte's what could go wrong
Take half your money.  But leaps.  Take the other half and average th down 3 months out on dips.
otm leaps?
It’s like the season of tec on the astronomical calendar of stocks. I’m curious what’s next after tec fades in a few yrs.
Waiting for a small dip to load up more. It’s never gonna happen is it?

Maybe institutions are pumping tesla to 1374 to force Elon to split the stock… getting extremely over leveraged with insane options to chase profits they missed because of them being underweight this whole time.
How are you guys doing? I got Tesla puts and VIX calls. Can’t feel my asshole anymore.
One thing I learned is to never short a stock with retard strength.
I don't like risking my own money but I love options - that's why I use margin

NVDA now larger than BRK. From garage nerd graphics card maker to the 7th most valuable company in the US. Only MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA and FB have higher market cap. FB, you're next.
What is next with FB?
I think they mean NVDA will overtake FB in market cap with 1/6 of FB revenue because of retard strength  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Yes💯
Someone somewhere made over 70,000% on Avis calls this week. Truly marvelous
But he only put 100 dollars
Throwing in $100 and ending the day with over $70,000 isn't a bad day. Definitely an underused opportunity if you had intended to risk more money, but certainly not something to sneer at.
Yeah
But i saw on the morning it was at 3000 and i was fucking coward to buy it. It went 20000 per call
still a million

This comment = Flawless Victory   I also would of accepter Weiger Muslims as a perfect response
Uighur
Ughuranium
And how much are being decomissioned elsewhere? I see a near-zero sum here...
What you mean, nuclear is on the come up look at what France is doing
I see a lot of ageing reactors just living on ever more extended life-spans partially beyond their original design specs:

[https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/age-profile-of-nuclear-power-capacity-in-selected-regions-2019](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/age-profile-of-nuclear-power-capacity-in-selected-regions-2019)

I see the EPR in Flamanville being built since 2007, the EPR in Olkiluoto since 2005. I see Hinkley Point C requiring a guaranteed (and inflation adjusted) feed-in tariff of 109 €/MWh to be built (and they just started building in 2019 ... 8 years delayed already) ...

So even when the building-time is cut in half for future reactors, that would still be about 8 years per unit. And I did not even begin to mention the massively exceeded budgets for above projects... which (without guarantees like in the case of Hinkley Point C) makes building and running those reactors a loss-making business .

well things like that happen when yer using a clown brokerage
great interface, cheap margin, whats not to like
bad order fills, glitches, run by a team of clowns, and IKBR's margin is cheaper.

Damn I usually hate on GME but good work playa! HBD!
I cashed out on 10k too, kept one contract hoping it runs up again tmw. Up 3k on that one at the moment 🤞🏽🤞🏽🤞🏽

Don't gamble your house down payments.  That's what the kids college fund is for
True
You lost your down payment gambling?
Ya I’ll
Make it back. And hopefully by then houses will
Be more affordable
Wtf dude. Don’t gamble
transfer your down payment into

I hope that GME squeezes again just because those GME retards give out awards like candies. Got so many golds back in January/February during the GME craze. Haven’t even gotten a snek award since.
I block girls who only talk about stocks and never shit post. Take that over to r/investing , we’re here to talk about eating ass and being cucked and then *maybe* stocks.
I really hate the majority of people on reddit. But the minority of people on here make it okay
You can delete the “on Reddit” and it’s still accurate.
WSB is the only reason I can tolerate reddit. The number of people that can't tolerate accepting they are wrong is ridiculous.
Real people are garbage
Wow. Is this it to our lives? We just wake up everyday, go to work, shit post on here, open Robinhood, look at some lines, close Robinhood, cry, and then do it all over again? Is this really it 🥲? Like, where are the Magicks, dragons, holy swords, dwarves, and shit?

Need a cigarette after that trading session.
If we’re big red tomorrow and I really sold my puts at the top I may jump off a bridge
I mean everything is at a super ATH level after rallying on expected news, it's not inconceivable that we see some red at least imo. At least that's what my NQ100 short white pill is telling me.
GME going to continue its steeper and steeper trajectory to the moon
oooof ROKU
Congrats to everyone who bought ROKU puts.
I bought a 100 of the 200p right before close
Holy shit talk about deep OTM lol. You think they will print?
Where it’s at right now I’ll make between 3800-5k profit if it keeps dipping the sky is the limit but it might go back up off earning who knows I’m here to gamble and have fun
Godspeed bro. Not bad for a $600 yolo
I just hope it keeps going down and they don’t buy the dip I read the report with the 27m sell from the CEO thats very bearish to me with them knowing abt what earnings look like and decide to sell
Wait for the call. It’s not looking to good for them wit that shit guidance they just gave. 

Where did you get those potential profits from? Optionsprofitcalculator.com is showing me way less.
Options profit  calculater nov 19 200p
Cathie wood and her Tesla predictions be giving me wood 😳
Check her Zillow predictions too for a cold shower.
shoutout to anyone who bought ROKU puts, this earnings season seems to be the slaughterhouse bringing inflated covid stocks back to reality (except tsla of course)
I'm putting my last 2k on AIRBnB put spreads
ooo thats a good idea, do they have earnings comin up?
Tomorrow after-hours they have earnings. Peloton also looks juicy.
SQQQ is going to have to reverse split before the end of the year.

Easiest money made is buy calls on tsla first thing tomorrow pending the market doesn’t shit itself over night. Works every time.
Tesla stock price to low imo
It’s incredible that in 5-10 years we are all going to be looking back at right now the exact same way we look back at the covid recovery in March 2020. 

An unprecedented bull run propped by the federal reserve and JPOW printing money, SPY at ATH every day, and people STILL buy puts for some reason. You guys can make so much money just riding the bubble.
Fuck yea![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
They are printing less each month now. That’s the thing
50% of my net worth is riding on this conference call for TTWO. The waiting music has me feeling like I’m in a dream, potentially about to be murdered or off to Valhalla
Damn rip your $35 🆘
Typically I that is what it would be but I’ve 8k in otms. Probably shouldn’t have done that but I’ve never had this much before so I won’t miss it much
That EPS miss yikes
we knew that would be the case though. The stock is carried by the GTA series. Not only are they going to have a lot of success, but the VR version of San Andreas and the potential of exclusivity to Oculus, is going to insane for TTWO
ATVI just got murdered yesterday.. this will be a big miss
I know. But I’m confident this won’t be as bad as ATVI
Oh yea it won’t be as bad for sure. But why not sell and rebuy after earnings. Anyway let’s see
Because I think there’s good chance they elaborate on partnership with Facebook oculus
My Roku hurts.
$NET puts! 🍻
Tomorrow I will buy many of these.
It’s going to be glorious AH
The Earnings "Oh by the way this is still an early stage growth company" Report. Even for tech hype it's way overbought. Think I'll target a few weeks out just in case, but I'm thinking like 150 strikes at least.

Gonna apply soothing ointment to my butt hole and ice it all day. Curse you OCGN calls. Damn I got reamed.
Can't wait to see NKLA chart slowly roll down a hill tmrw. How tf is that company even solvent
Market cap of 5 bil. The new tsla ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Bought some COIN after hours.. hope to make some quick bucks 😁
how fucked are my FSLY puts tomorrow? 

they’re extremely OTM weeklies
-99% at open
F
Looks like the market took FSLYs results well so they’re fuk

100 of each?
Almost like tapering was priced in months ago.
🤔
FSR flat as fuck post earnings. I’m salivating with the IV crush
How much Zillow did Cathie buy today. Can’t wait to see that email
I sold a put. I don’t really want assignment but I’ll get assigned if it goes ITM. I’ll never cover that thing.
I would’ve done the same but tying up 5k in a single ticker is too much for my portfolio
289k shares i think
That was yesterday lol
If these gains hold im buying a drone
Get a dji
I think I’m beginning to understand what they mean when they say don’t fight the Fed…. 🤔 🤡
/u/-C20H24O3 I bet Cathie bought a bunch of ETSY about an hour ago
And Zillow and Roku
heard a youtuber say that movie chain going down last week was bullish for earnings this week. now that earnings is pushed to next week, hes saying movie chain going up is bullish for earnings. tbh i gotta give him credit for just spewing bullshit and pulling in cash from subscribers and donations.
Just waiting for all the 🐻 to post their spy puts loss porn
They never post on green Day’s
It definitely feels worse to sell too early than to sell too late. Could have had 100% + gains today
I was up 450% on amc calls. I held like a moron.
You’re nuts. I have trouble holding over 30% but that’s on spy and qqq
DKNG gonna be a winner tomorrow
Why?
Cause I’m speaking it into existence
DD checks out. All in.
Woohoo dont lie to me but i hope this isn't sarcasm ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Lmao just saw cramer call his camera guy a loser for not having a vr headset handy
How many people bought Zillow at 63.xx? I bought 300 shares
> I bought 300 shares
Should’ve sold 3 puts first to get it at below 60
I keep buying uvxy calls because I absolutely hate making money
With RSI on SPY breaking 72 today, I’m looking for a VIX bounce in 3 days, plus or minus. You might consider waiting to enter your positions until the RSI becomes overbought/oversold on the 1yr chart. It has kept me from over-trading small changes in direction and getting caught wrong.
I haven’t gone all in yet. Been trying to time this massive spike that we’re due for. The only thing that’s saved me from pulling the trigger and truly screwing myself is the SPY 1 yr chart, like you said. I figured we were due for a nice runup but it’s been so damn steady. At this point I’m looking at Tesla to dip as a catalyst for a uvxy spike. Seems like it’s carrying the whole damn market. Imma just hold what I have for now and load up on 11/12 calls tomorrow if I like what I see.
Vix is nearing its YTD lows, market is pretty fucking happy with Powells speech today.
Everyone except for Pfizer
Nobody puts BBBY in the corner.

Lol I threw like $400 at 15c skillz lotos and was happy for half a second but whatever.
im gonna lose so much money unless Nikola file for bankruptcy tomorrow
It’s a fraudulent company burning cash and creating nothing of value. So probably due a SP spike
🐻s fuk'd more than Aaron Rodgers
Ford up 1/10th of a penny AH. Bullish AF, calls
Roku will get crushed as Google, Amazon and likely Apple start pushing their own TVs
Hardware has shit margins. There’s no reason to make  branded TVs. It’s all about content and ROKU hardly has anything to offer in that regards
Yea when Google and Amazon sell they are partnering with tv manuf and slapping there name on it. They will likely split the money from content and ads which is where money is.
I’m so fucking beaten down by OCGN haha I’m gonna put all I have into RKT earnings. Flip the coin and Fuck it
Nothing like a big L to follow up a big L amirite?
Revenge trading. You will surely lose more!
It’s my specialty
Don’t make that mistake. Put in Tesla spreads
Whoever commented ROKU puts 10mism before close 

Thank u
I really fucking hate to call it early, but i may be posting my first ever gain porn from Qualcom calls.
Congrats, the market will now move against you. Its not gain porn til you sell
You just jinxed yourself bud. Puts on Qualcom
Ok I wanna go ahead and buy a house for 25k at the edge of a huge metropolis and make enough money sitting around an office or factory smoking all day complaining about commies with no regard for the future because it's already mapped out, for me anyway. Where do I sign up?
You're late like 70 years bro

"SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR): Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.06 beats by $0.04; GAAP EPS of -$0.49 misses by $0.47."

hookers and blow are expenses following gaap but they treated them as an investment.

Gah damn I was eyeing calls for that too ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Miss by .02 ain't much
I ain't hearing DKNG enough on this sub Not sure if I should worry lmao.
I bought APR calls in the 60s. Fuck that piece of trash. Unless it moons by then.
So dumb of Bears to doubt JP, him and his girlfriend Morgan literally created Chase bank, why wouldnt he love printing money?
I hate you
Just got a settlement what should I invest in (bad advice only)
Roku calls a few hours ago
TSLA $2000 1/22/22 calls
He said bad advise only
Jg wentworth?
ZG puts. No, seriously, it’s peak WSB to buy puts when a stock has dropped already like 33% in a week
Z surely can't go lower, as does atvi...surely
short SPY puts
Timeshares
He said bad advices, not getting tied to literal shit for generations
Yetis and funko pops
AMC
TSLA
Rate my calls: 

FB, PTON, MSFT, PYPL, V, DIS, SBUX
MSFT >FB> DIS  >SBUX> PYPL> V >PTON
I wish you good fortune in the wars to come. I got PTON puts
I'm in FB and a dis leap (but that's been so gay for me) looking at PayPal Jan calls after I saw good consolidation and a triple bottom today.
Yeah the PayPal bottom was rough last week. Now it’s a little tighter on entry. Easier spread on Visa but much looser.
Might look to do some PCS on PayPal. Seems like it found a good bottom
I have Meta leaps 1/21/23 $400. Once the 2022 is going to bring a lot of change to the firm. That plus the ticker change bro? So cool.
I got V too, FB is really iffy, you never know what it will do so I hope you're dated out to next earnings, MSFT is a coin flip since it's already pretty high up.
Hopefully those are FB leaps at least…
My FB is a deep 325 12/17. Really expensive but safer
Solid, actually. I think that’ll pay
Drop PTON like a bad habit
Nah, my 90 1/22 will make me at least 1K
Apparently this is /r/Investing
Have you even lived if you’ve never FOMO’d into the top of something? 🤢🤢🤢
I like you guys so I’m gonna warn you. I’m buying SPY calls tomorrow and I do believe a malevolent god wants me to lose all my money, so I may drag the entire market down tomorrow. Sorry in advance
Already did at close, we open red
Bbby is running ah again
If you buy options listen closely to what your feelings say.
listen to what god tells you because according to billy, "god loves fair price" if god tells you that option is below its fair price, buy it
I need a 40k yolo expiring Friday
TSLA calls, obviously
TSLA
SQ.
BABA
Don’t miss the boat on BABA. I sold at a loss today like a dumbass
Tqqq calls
Even better: sell OTM TQQQ call spreads expiring Friday.
Lot of pumpers, a lot more dumpers
Did my part to avenge Bill Hwang by buying 7,000 shares of VIAC
Anybody know what’s moving TLRY?
why did i bet against FSLY when Cathie dumped it for a big L?

Why the SKLZ selloff? Revenue and gross margin looked pretty good.
Overreaction, I’ll add
expected "earnings" -0.13/share

actual "earnings" -0.16/share

🤡
Why you care? You want every ticker go zero right?
> Yes, I want every stock to go zero.
I see
Lmfao, wtf? 

And honestly just curious. My brother in law owns shares.
Coz you been crying tesla to go 900 for last couple of days
Because I own XPEV and LI lmao. 

And I just generally think that Elon Musk is a union busting piece of shit, who retaliates against whistleblowers and manipulates his own stock for fun, among other things.
Yeah he is. But why hate make money?
I am making money….investing in TSLA’s competitors.
Ohhh
I feel like devils lettuce stocks are undervalued rn
And will stay that way until the next president totes legalization in his campaign.
I prefer jazz cabbage

It’s down 10%
Wish I could turn back time to September dip ..
Good news! It's only 11 months away from happening again!
You should have gone for the calls.
Roku touched my no-no zone ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
N?
I've never seen a single one of my relatives or friends use Roku TV before. Most of them  have smart tvs that come with smart remotes so there is no need to use roku to stream netflix or disney.
Watching OCGN ah is scaring the shit outta me. Wish I could’ve dumped that before close
I had class right at market close and couldn’t offload these Zillow puts y’all think it’ll keep tanking or sell at open
It's going down down down
To the bottom of the sea

Me too. Better drill at least for the morning

When the kids finally figure out how to make some money slinging options on SPY, I’ll be proud.
In some ways I miss the simpler times in WSB.

Bought shares when it was red, plan to do so any red day.

But that 5% pull back in sept was prolly Fed pricing in this news. 

We ride to Valhalla till end of year. Then I bet a 2-5% pull back
If you can swing it get 245 calls they are hitting
Man I hope the stock market goes down so I can spend some time on other hobbies and maybe actually get some bitches...
Best time to get bitches is when you have money.
Yeah when you have money. Not when you’re making money.
How do you not have money in the greatest bullrun in history?
Nah I have money, it’s just that in the largest bull run you could always make more money. Can’t think about bitches when I see retards making 20x on their Tesla calls.
Losing money over bitches anyday😎
Anyone got a life check on the dude who's gonna lose his house and wife since he decided to try to bet against the early November markets?

If it keeps going up does it just go round to the bottom again then keep rising?
It'll just do splits if warranted
The market could split in two. In to a bull market and a bear market, everyone makes money that way, it just keeps going up for ever.
I'm gonna pretend the lack of OCGN talk means my puts will print.
Fml bought Z put but closed for a loss bc I had to go to sleep and it ended up being a 4 bagger EOD.
We love Cathie! Hang in there grl! No rope!
Wow this thread is so much better without meme shrills, spy and tesla 🌈 🐻
Tesla bear. Kill me. P1190 and 1180 expiration on Friday. Every time it looks like things are looking up, it shoots the moon.
Power hour was brutal today. 1130p 11/19 here that I got near open, at least I have some time
Damn, why'd you pick Tesla to be bearish on? I mean I think it's crazy overvalued but it has so much retard strength that'd I'd never buy puts
It’s valuation makes no sense. I though it was going to correct back to 1100, which is still an outrageous climb. I still have hope that it “sinks” to 1150. No one would be shocked if that happened.
🤨
Puts on the most innovative man in the world right now is retarded
I made a banbet a couple of days ago (I think) but I ~~is~~ ~~am~~ was so stoned that I don't remember what it is. It'll be a surprise. Fun!

[deleted]
the amount of money transacted won’t make a difference, the sub mostly lose money anyways, also SPY has perceived cheaper contracts but in fact is less efficient than SPX on an equal weighted basis
Same rule also applies to /ES, part of why I trade it on short term plays.

So this proves tapering has no effect on tech stocks right?
it does but it was priced in by now

So Cathie has been buying the Z waterfall since 200 and even bought yesterday and is throwing in the towel today so looks like the bottom is now in
If they not flipping, then most of their revenue is gone, they're now a much smaller company and will ptobably incurr losses for a bit. The fundamentals has changed since the earnings and that announcement, makes sense Cathie sold
Cathie is a fucking retard. She belongs here
Outlook on RE is not as rosy as the glassy tech appearance.
AMC did not report earnings this week vis mod and the earnings whisper lied 

Prove me wrong
Earning whispers and ameritrade both show 11/08
Contrary to that (yes it is the 8th) this link will show you the earnings whisper top on this page shows the earnings were the “2nd” 

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qitibp/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

And viz mod lied:

> You're a fucking idiot.
That may be true, but amc reports the 8th I’m right you’re wrong viz mod
Damn vismod needs to chill
So they screwed up, we would heard from the apes if it had been on 2nd, big time :)
Forreal, but viz mod won’t admit it was wrong. Need fix bug
It’s no biggie, Vismod can be wrong too, we’re all bots after all:) people serious about playing ER don’t really rely on that chart, it’s just nice to have for the big picture.
Great point

Anyone know the capital requirements for an ISDA?
> The capital requirements for an ISDA are very high. The hedge fund community has been lobbying Congress to allow them to use leverage on their derivatives trades, but so far this request has not been granted.

CLOV
honestly whats the bullish case for clov? its been trading sideways for ages now
It’s good for selling options if you’re into that sort of thing. High IV, relatively predictable low value of shares, large volume
i only do stocks and cfd´s, i´ll lose the farm if I started options
He means selling calls,not buying them
I use etoro so stocks and cfds is all I can do anyway
Don’t bulls die from excess gas if they consume too much clover? Maybe I was too high watching Yellowstone.
> It is true that the consumption of large amounts of clover can cause excess gas in bulls. However, it’s not from consuming too much clover itself but rather from a bacteria found on most plants called methanobrevibacter smithii which produces methane as a byproduct.
Leave that poor man alone, clovetard:)
Ugh

Jobs at the bottom of the tar pit are forced to increase wages to secure employees causing wage pressures across the entire curve. If you are a skilled employee now is a good time to receive a 20%+ pay increase.
So if you just buy weekly calls on SPY near the money, then sell them Thursday and rebuy on a dip, you just make money? Why has no one told me this
Let’s go SQ!

Fed taper = fapper
You guys don’t understand what jpow meant
What did he mean?
The bond purchases will be starting from this month.
Xxx bond purchases for xxx billions will be starting this month. Which is very small and rate hikes will be starting from next year june about 1.2% and consecutively every 3 months or 6 months rate hike.

This could change if economy recovery is fast and supply chain issues are reduced along with inflation becomes reasonable.

Fed still think inflation is transitory and no rate hikes will be until next year 2022.
I watch the conference today and JPOW said taper will be this month and end at mid year next year
Rate hikes are only from june. And jpow will continue to do asset purchases. Thats why market rallied. Taper is there but very very small percentage
Taper is 15 billion 8% per month. More or less depend on other thing. Jpow doesn’t say when is rate hike
Sorry let me correct that tapering is 12.5% per month
Fed purchasing 120 billion dollars and they reduce it to 110 billion dollars this month. Which is very small
No they reduce 15b not 10
Yeah not big deal. We still got 105 billion dollars free money. Would you care pay check from 1700 to 1550?
Are there hedge funds that are actually short spy rn?
I think BA of A had puts. That’s not a hedge fund, but it is pretty funny.
I’d call that a hedge for all of their longs (mbs and probably some long stock)
I thought they were net short I didn’t really look into it, only heard secondhand from a stranger wearing a spy 500 EOD headband.
How was everyone’s FED day? I ordered a good lunch to watch mr Jpow speak today and then fell asleep.
I got +200+% on my SPY calls.
I bought puts and died :)
I was going to and then forgot yesterday.

Sometimes life is funny like that
Nice! I closed an amc call for around that in the morning , then bought some hedges for other positions.
Lunch and fell asleep? YOU DONT WORK?  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Qcom going to party like it’s 1999 tomorrow
Am I retarded (yes) for not buying TSLA calls rn during this insane gamma / rally that's been going on? I'm a small account and novice so I've always just concluded the premiums are too massive to risk
That's what spreads are for... and I'm probably the retard for buying put spreads now that it's stalled out the last few days
I'm not comfortable buying spreads at this point, only been trading options 2 months. Thanks though
buy spreads to get at least some piece
This is embarrassing but I've been trading options for like 2 months and don't feel totally comfortable with spreads right now. I gotta practice with way lower risk. I've studied up on the concepts but sure as hell won't be learning with TSLA. And in this market straight calls have been working extremely well as it is.

Thank you for the advice though
Debit spreads are lower risk than straight calls?
But I want to lose it all and fast!
Just buy really far out of the money short expiry options. Aim for delta < 5. Go get em.

Never exercise.  Sell, take the proceeds and either buy shares or more calls.

Idgaf. I don’t want to hear modern music in western movies. How bout jay z tho? Fuck no. What about when Django..NO
What do you mean by modern music though? Do you mean the style, or do you mean anything past a certain date?
I’m watching this new western featured on Netflix and the music feels so out of place. The only exception I can think of is Dead Man which was scored by Neil Young. It was incredible but he didn’t play his hits, he wrote a score for the film
But the soundtrack was absolutely fire tho. 100 black coffins by Rick Ross, and that Tupac mix from James brown. 

Classic.

When i find a good play with a good chart, I hesitate to buy it. When i find something 50/50, i take the risk and lose tendies

SPY up 7% in the past 3 weeks with supply shortages, labor shortages, and inflation.  Typical yearly return is \~10%.  If you try to be rational in this market you're losing money to moonbois who think it only goes up and buy OTM calls every week
First off 10% isn’t a “typical yearly return”. That’s the average of yearly returns which are sometimes +20%, -15%, 1% etc.

Second off - spy is up like 1% from the September high before the huge dip.

Your lack of basic critical thinking is why you can’t make money in a bull market
It only goes up
Market can stay irrational longer than your put’s expiration date.
All of which were priced in last month.
Shut up, Burry
Fuck it, buying my first put today. TSLA has just been absolutely retarded lately, I am going to show it who is the bigger retard.
Good men have died on that field, you must realize it's not logic based right? Good luck!
Every time TSLA goes green some WSB member is so sure they can time it going back down even tho it has done nothing but moon for the past 2 years.
Don’t be a hero

What's wrong? Lost money?
took out loans against my mortgage to buy SPY puts........ I am so fucked. god damn this is really fucking sad. I dont know what the fuck to do
But you said it’s like $7k, can you get it onto a credit card so you can take a monthly payment? Go check the mail, people want to transfer your balance for a low 3% fee right now!  You can probably find the offer on bank of america’s site
RRREEEEEEE

I know that feel

A huge number of people who hold stocks and speculate in the market are so uninformed they didn’t even know there was a fed meeting today.

Let that sink in.
How’s those TSLA puts going
A lot didn't even know it was election day yesterday either
I'm fed up with meetings, I can tell ya that much
Whatsa fed meeting?
When the boss buys lunch
But not a huge amount of the stock market, by dollars
I’m shorting the fuck out of UBER tmrw. There are never any rides available (In Metro) and they price gouge to make up the difference. My theory is they’re experiencing a severe driver shortage. 

They’re up 7% today on bullshit news. 

Gonna buy some 43P
Driver shortage is real, increased costs for rides too. Scam company
bc they don't pay...... none of the gig apps pay worth a shit anymore....
They were up because Lyft reported good earnings. Idk anything about being a gig worker, but almost every car I’ve gotten in drives for both companies so unless Lyft is somehow paying them more, I don’t see how Uber is doing any worse driver wise.
They rode lyft's earnings coattails today but yeah puts
yea i like this play, i'm gonna get some at open
Sound logic. !remindme 1 month
I seriously hope Z goes to like $10.  I don’t own puts I just hate them.   Lost at least one house we bid on this summer to them offering all cash, 740k on a home listed at 615k that was probably worth 675k at best.  My kids loved that house
We should all short that scummy company
Anyone got a shovel? I’m trying to dig my spy puts out of my ass
I’m sorry about the losses, but why puts man, why?
Me dumb, everyone too excited about calls, tried to inverse sentiment
Funny you should say that. I got spy calls around 130 because i thought this place was to bearish at the time
You’re dumb lol, next trade will be legendary for you.🤩
Hahaha I hope! Same for you, make that money
If I understand what you're saying, you're dumber than the WSB brain trust. I'm sorry.
Yes, 100% yes
At least we’re hedged for some yolo calls

This is the trick my bro. Have a family history of it. You need to lay down on your back on the ground. Bear huge your shins with your knees towards your chest. Pull/push your shins towards yourself so your knees are going towards your face/chest. Gotta do that repeatedly for 1 whole minute and your back pain will cease to exist.

Weren't you WARNED not to say that!
Bruh I had 2 NVDA 250c for December that were down 50% then sold it for breakeven. It defo had baddays. Just checked I sold em for 460 now its 2.4k lol. While the baba call I've been holding been down 56%..ffs LET ME WIN ONE OF THESE DAYS.
How is everyone
Meh
What’s up
Man
My feet are sweaty and I can’t sleep
Drink some water and sit outside for like 5 mins
I'm OK. How are you?
I’m doing okay, I’m glad you are the same page
My man. Have some gold.
Feeling semi optimistic for the future, lots on my plate but keeping the feet moving. Wbu?
Doing great, wbu
Doing okay my guy, happy you are doing great
fucking great after making a ton today
Fuck yeah let’s go, what was your plays if you don’t mind me asking
so I have been buying spreads for about a week out on stuff thats getting a lotta chatter here (literally no DD) ill buy 5 that are about 5/10% out. if it starts to jump I will sell half the spreads and then use that to buy back the sold call, and ride it out.

I did this with FIGS today, was holding 5 11/19 40/50 call spreads, and when it started to run, I sold 2 of them, which gave me enough to buy back the sold 50c , i now have 3 40c that are naked, and then it just ran.

same with TWLO today to.

also got TSLA, but I dont have the cash to buy back the sold call so I just buy new spreads with higher strikes.

this is not investment advice, I am retadred.
Chillin' and the right drunk. You?
Sober but high on life my guy, what ya drinking

I got my gf into it. she picked up ETSY , CHWY , TSM , and some other shit in Sept 2020. couldn't believe her timing. oh and some other shit that popped 50%+ in less than 6 months. oh BB when it was like $5 or some shit.
I hope Zillow takes a massive dump today please I'll never buy puts again
Let me fomo into puts when a company is down 40 percent in a week lmao you deserve to get fkd 😂😂
I had nightmares tonight, OCGN dropped 30% in a day after i put my life savings in. Wait…
I started with 10K went to 100K and then back to 8K in 2 months. 

Now I start with 10K. Take it to 20K. Take profits and start with 10K again.
Or you could start with 10k to 100k and take profits 😎
I was thinking the same. I would have been done working for the next 2-3 months. Why even start trading if you're not going to take profits and use it? Set a base level of capital you want to keep in your account, when you hit over that you take profits and move them to a bank account. Rinse and repeat. 


It's important not to get too greedy or too much FOMO, because that's what turns you to a bag holder. Take a reasonable profit, and don't worry about if it hits a new later that week. There will always be more opportunities. More dips. More squeezes, more pump&dumps. Don't worry about riding every single one as high as possible.
That’s a phenomenal philosophy to trading
I start with 1k make it to 9k burn it all then reload 5k go to 800 now back to 6k

If it opens at 500 I will never buy another stock again
Matched with this chick on bumble and she says she’s a life coach. I ask her some simple questions like “Have you been to jail?” “Have you been homeless?” “Have you overcome a drug addiction?”…all answers were no. So what gives you the experience to help coach other people’s lives that have real problems?     
   
 I got no clear answer and unmatched  🤷‍♂️
You probably should have just like, had sex with her instead.
Lmao idk if those three things necessarily qualify you to be a life coach… maybe the opposite.
Someone who overcomes some really hard shit and straightens out, then yea they should help others through difficult times.
I mean I get it, it is someone that has been through experiences. I’m not discounting thay, it’s just, I think those problems are RELATIVELY easy to avoid, so I question your ability to provide me advice when you have been through rather avoidable situations. Not only avoidable, but damn near top priority avoidable.
It’s easy to avoid because of your experiences in life and upbringing. This is what I’m trying to say. It’s not easy for people that were raised without certain life prepping skills and are in situations they can’t get out of easily.
You don’t need to have aids to treat aids patients...same logic applies here
Not really. These are emotions. The best people to relate to a problem are those who have been there themselves and have overcome the obstacles. How can someone relate to someone who’s only experience is studying a book?
when i go to a gas station and i’m standing behind someone standing at the counter for 10 minutes buying lottery tickets, i look at them with shame and disgust.

its ironic because I sit behind a screen 7 hours a day just to lose my money on the stock market , at least i do it the classy way
Objectively, we are in the midst of an insane bull run. Don’t bet against it. 

If you can’t see that, you should try a cheaper hobby.

Holding Zillow puts, Tesla calls and spy calls biatch
Where do bears get their money?  Like how can you consistently lose so much money.
They short stocks that have ran to crazy amounts, make some money and think “look at all these stocks crashing, the market should also crash too” then short the market and get anal’d by JPOW and his money fist ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Selling their bodies
Puts
Plenty of hype crap to short and make  🧀, every day another one blows up..China, Zillow, Chegg, Peleton, Zoom, etc.

Just don’t short Indexes, FANG, TSLA and you’re ok.
Pretty sure your mom pays them.
Buying puts on life and buying calls on rope first thing in the morning😩
SPY STILL RUNNIN LMAO
So many signs we are at peak euphoria, but I can't buy puts because I'm too poor from being a 🌈 🐻
no euphoria, just a regular ass QE market

every time the fed has done QE in the last 10 years, markets just go up with basically no pullbacks, this one seems euphoric but its not, its because the amount of QE right now is fukken batshit insane and way higher than any previous QE session

give it 6 months when QE is 25% of current levels and you'll see a difference

in 2019 they were doing something like 30 billion a month and the nasdaq pumped 30% in the span of 3-4 months, they are currently printing 120 billion a month so figure it out
Can you please figure it out for me

All my credit cards are maxed and I have $26.79 in my bank accounts should I transfer money from Robinhood or nah?
You should take money out of Robinhood, yes
too late went all in on SPY expiring Friday

This is all the confirmation I need.
Ask for a credit limit increase and a transfer check
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Banks hate this one trick that gets you free money.  Get more credit cards.
Margin bro you’re not out yet
take out another credit card
No pain no gain. No risk-it no biscuit. NO
Robinhood takes a day or more to take money outa your account, just instant deposit all you can and make 50% and deposit it back into your account
Wow
hell nah
holy shit I've been dozing outside my backyard hitting my stiiizy and just thinking about a 5-1 TSLA stock split the whole time. Like I legit lost myself for a good 30 minutes just thinking about that stock jesus christ

Missed out on over 7k in $Z put gains. Hurts..
Yeah my BB covered calls at 12 that expire this Friday were looking like they were going to get called away. Learned my lesson from last time BB kissed $12 and I panic-bought-to-close my CCs and lost a bunch of money when i could've just diamond handed through the opening 2 hours and been fine. 

Held on today and was rewarded with another chance to lose tomorrow.
OCGN cell wall at 12.80 is unreal
I'm starting to believe that the TSLA multi-trillion dollar GAMMASPLOSION might be real.
I don’t even know why I look at the TSLA after hours chart. +1% by 6pm

That’s a WR no doubt
Why

Spy puts right?
ROKU calls?
Post the loss porn from the FSLY puts
RIP my QCOM and FSLY puts.
This is the moment. 50% of my port is in OTM calls for TTWO 190c 12/10

I'm too angry to cry, or else I'd be sobbing

Can a fellow WSB’er comment on Z calls !? I’d like an outside opinion
🤡
Don't fomo.  Wait for the stock to either start some sideways movements or a slight uptrend over a 2-5 days before entering.

Or fomo, and risk watching your call lose 90% of its value in one day.

But honestly they just got rekt by the sale of all these homes at a loss. What a mess.
Search for u/Hour_Amphibian1844 on Z play. You might see something good there. 

I tailed him on the date of his post, got on $185 P, cashed out, back with $180P, cashed out, and got back again this afternoon at $160P, and cashed out as well. 

It's probably good to play Z call now, give it a few weeks to recover.
This is the first time in 7-8 quarters that FSLY didn't crash after reporting earnings.
and aren't they reporting one of the worst quarters? its going up because i bought puts that fuckin bitch
Shouldn’t have bailed on that TSLA call this morning.

At least I have these MSFT 335s that totally won’t bleed to death all day tomorrow.
If it makes you feel any better. You’re not the only one who sold Tesla calls early today.

Is it a bad time for TQQQ calls or will it continue to rocket everyday for the month ..
Tqqq calls until next march
This is what I needed to hear
I’ve been buying calls all week and I sold and bought more at close today too it’s looking strong I think it will keep going tmrw
i held my calls so i could sell tomorrow when it peaks. Jpow's speech was full of good news
ATVI got bitch slapped into literally no movement. Never seen that before

SKLZ gonna dump enough to make me lose my call profits but not enough for my 10p to print huh
Sweetgreen going public is cool
The chipotle of salad. Overhyped IMO.
Implied volatility is scary.  My FLSY puts I bought yesterday with a strike price of **$40** went up 54.55% today and the stock jumped 8% during market hours.  Jesus.

I know it'll be absolutely worthless tomorrow due to IV crush but still funny that buying puts on a stock that jumped 8% intraday could make people money.

Anyone else just switch between ubereats, Grubhub, and door dash free trials and just watch them flood your email with more free trials and coupons when you leave. No way this business model is sustainable
You’re probably in a less mature market. Once markets mature those promos slow down and they become profitable due to established merchants and consumer habit
Downtown Chicago
Oh yeah, Chicago was a Grubhub dominated market for awhile. DoorDash took over recently though, and UberEats has been pushing hard in that market too. Lots of competition so not surprised you’re seeing promos

Some place like San Francisco where DoorDash market share is like 80% or something, the promos aren’t as aggressive

I wouldn’t be surprised if the taper was the overhang that has now been removed from pms. It was curious that spot gold was down a percent but Gdx was up.
I went deep into SLV calls after fed meeting. Eyes glued to futures tonight. If it can break through 23.65 pretty convincingly, $24 is easy
How short term are your calls? Tbh I wouldn’t worry about it for now. If you have 6 months plus I can see silver at $28 again
I grabbed 12/3 $22 which I know is pretty short. I'll reassess tomorrow what to do with them

My strategy is broke. If a stock goes up a good percent one day, my dumbass decides to short it the next day, only to wake up to the stock going up higher. Fml.
You should stop.
I agree. I’ve just become numb to loosing money 😐. Scared to check my bank act

I’ve heard it’s the easiest money ever
Why would it be easy? Genuinely curious
I’m not sure it’s just what I heard
Because it's the future, where nobody knows what's going to happen, so an even playing field. I mean, most investors can't figure out what's happening today.

Is that sarcasm
No. I’m serious
I'm about to try it

I don’t those suckers blasted me all morning
The play was fine it was just some peoples expectations were insane. At best 20's was possible which it didnt do. Im happy with how it turned out though.
I have a controversial take on that whole industry but that aside, this imo was a pump and dump. Insane and massive volume mentioning that ticker on multiple platforms. Most meme stonks don’t get that kind of sudden action. Expectations were high and artificial.

It was like they really wanted to create one more covid vax stock explosion but this isnt really that. Regardless, 9 to 18 if you played it right but i sold most at an average of 16ish. Very happy
Look at my comment history, then tell me if you feel bad or not afterwards. They down voted me to hell cuz I said the obvious,
Whenever I do leg day I end up soaking my entire shirt in sweat. Also my shorts. When I sit down I leave a perfect imprint of my balls on the seat 😳😔
Buying ten puts on Activision. (Update...bad call)
Its already down
i bet it will go down at least another 10%
They really don’t have too many relevant games anymore do they? The rest are old.  COD sucks Imo, PUBG mobile way better. They need a decent battle royal.
> They have PUBG mobile.
No, That’s Tencent
was debating buying puts on ROKU when it was at 317 the other day, debated doing a banbet too. didn't pull the trigger. THIS IS WHAT YOU GET FOR BEING A PUSSY
tomorrow we fly round 2
Honeywell can recycle plastics into oil now… bullish
If you’re going to buy calls, buy V, ATVI, and SPY calls.
V only goes down
I’d say just for now. Currently, I think it is in a dip that could be considered buyable
considering a leap on ATVI, worried that some other shit is gonna come out tho so i might just stick with shares like a loser tho lol. already got calls on V
That’s probably one of the safest things to do
Tsla
When does Sweetgreen IPO?
I'm watching a podcast on YouTube...man google is getting real aggressive with these ads...I think I've seen like 5 already within 30 mins..no wonder their stock is taking off
Chargepoint has been moving nicely as of late. I realize it’s tied to this Tesla movement, but I’m enjoying the crumbs.
Got some 12/3 30c that I’m hoping to take to the print shop
Any other brainlets buy the ATVI dip today? I didn’t even listen or look at the ER my investment thesis is I like Call of Duty and Vanguard comes out tomorrow
Solid DD actually, IMO.
Bought a bunch of Jan $80 calls
Jan calls
ROKU is the fastest fall from grace I've seen in a while. It was the darling child of wall street as roku unit was hot cakes during the pandemic lockdown. But that same pandemic is a double edged sword as supply constraints is giving lower sales guidance. On top of that roku is starting losing streaming services most notably YouTube
OK can we talk about this for a sec?
Rokus technology was first in class in 2015. Nothing was proprietary about it. They have no TV. It was basically a TV operating system.

They existed because there was a gap in TV OS at the time. Well guess what... They all caught up. Now I don't need roku anymore.

No one does. They failed to evolve.... Moving on...
Android TV. That’s a TV OS. Lot of TVs have their own OS, apps and all. Heck, cable boxes now have Netflix, Hulu, etc. 

Still, there’s something to be says about an external media device that plugs into any TV. 

Roku screwed up by bullying content providers.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
The only thing Roku seems to have over the built in TV apps (at least for my Samsung Q90a) is that the apps on Roku all seem to support dolby atmos which is a marked improvement in sound if you have the system for it.  The tv apps all seem to down sample to regular 5.1.

That said atmos is still kind of niche for most people and Roku needs to innovate somehow or they’re doomed so I totally agree. I wouldn’t buy Roku.
i mean ZM did the same thing
Where you think it will settle pre market?
If I could even guess 80% accurately what it would be I would be banging fashion models on a beach instead of slaving away at a cubicle
Those tcl roku TVs are still top sellers though
Gme wishes it were as cool as spy
I got Z puts and BABA puts alil before close and I think I was alil late to the party
No love here for QCOM?

I got some $20poots expiring Friday. May the best retard win.
so what did jpow say today, i missed it?

taper delayed?

He said fuck yo puts money printer go brrrr
He said and I quote 
"Fuck yo puts"
He said if everyone ordered their Lambos.
J Pow said, I will never do anything responsible so keep the party going.
Inflation is transitory, fed will begin taper in November decreasing bond purchases by 15b per month.

Anybody think MRNA gonna gap up tomorrow morning off ER got 10 contracts at 360c Nov 12
If it does I hope BNTX follows it like it has been and then vice versa when BNTX has earnings Monday
We can only hope so what calls you have for BNTX I have made a play on them yet
I grabbed 5 11/12 $330/$340 call debit spreads
Ima see how it goes tomorrow if it goes good ima buy some calls on it
People have been sleeping on how well Moderna and Biontech are doing
Ikr they have but I’m pretty sure a lot of ppl was on it when it ran to the 400’s so I think ppl gonna FOMO into if it knocks earning out the park
Yes TSLA, that’s what I love to seee
so nice the FOMC is over so i can stop trading stocks like i know what im doing and just ride SPY calls to free money
My expired spy puts are still showing in my account apparently still worth a penny and a half.  They are just sitting there mocking me.  Was a painful day.  I’m thinking calls on $ROPE
Hate that
MSFT 💰💰🚀for long metaverse  play ..thank me in year or two.
A year or 2 ? I'm trying to retire tomorrow
Wish you all the luck 🍀
Thanks , you too!
>metaverse

>long term

>year or two (aka after rate hikes)

uhhhhhhhhh sure bud
Rate hikes won't do shit to MSFT, they don't need to borrow money, and when they do issue bonds their credit rating is better than the US government so they don't need to have a higher rate than t notes/bonds if they don't want to
You dont think something that will cause a ripple through the entire market will have ANY effect on one of the largest market caps? Okay..
A hyper-profitable company in a high-rate environment is like Zoom during COVID. The market will eat it up.
Yeah, no one will pull money out of one of the largest tickers in the market when everything else they have is bleeding. Nope, nothing will happen to MSFT, stonks only go up
Microsoft hardly dipped during the March 2020 crash. Why would they dip in an environment they are even better suited for?
TIL that dropping 32% is "hardly dipping"
Compared to the rest of the market it was. My 200c's expired worthless, but MSFT commons carried my portfolio in late March.
> Compared to the rest of the market it was.

the S&P as a whole dropped roughly 36%

the difference of 4% is not the difference between "hardly dipping" and "flash crash"

Idc though, go as long as you want
Most of the market stayed down for months, MSFT shot right back up. That's my point. It'll thrive in a high rate environment relative to other stocks. There might be a general sale as people reposition, but it won't stay down IMO
Lol 🙏 wish you all the luck 🍀. MSFT 💰💰
I mean, im buying calls on them in the meantime, but thinking theyll keep up this trajectory for another 2 years is... interesting
sir this is a casino
By the by, Russell finna break out hard after 6 months of  being rangebound. Won't be the next spy, but damn if they ain't gunna fly until the dot plot timeline from the fed is released.
nah no ones buying small caps with rate hikes around the corner. IT IS THE DAWN OF THE MEGA CAP.  
EDIT: woah guess i was wrong. weird.
It’s Gona go parabolic
hmm maybe i will grab some russell. anyone have an explanation for this?
Iwm is a good play, and it's from the economic recovery narrative. If jobs reports keep meeting/beating expectations itll probably keep pace with the bigger indexes. It's consolidated for so long that a break upwards is going to be pretty large. I'd make some plays after data releases tomorrow and Friday.
another weird thing I've noticed: ever since august the market has been eerily similar to last year. even the bond market is mimicking last year. any ideas on why this is?
Nope. The market is weird.
Imagine buying an index where AMC and Crocs are the two largest holdings 🤡

Anybody getting in on the Nerdwallet IPO tomorrow?
Do we want to be in it?
Tomorrow I'm gonna diamond hand these 11/19 RACE calls and bet that a few big boys will push it closer to the new price targets of $290.

I'm going to watch these 11/12 QS calls very closely because I trust them about as much as I trust Nancy to get a bill passed.  I'll either close them or roll them by EOD, much sooner if there isn't any strength under them.

If I have to close the QS early, I'll take a close look at these ITM EVGO calls dated 11/19 and Dec. to see if I want to hold on or take the double.  If I wind up holding them and rolling the QS, I may take a flyer on BLNK calls as well.

These Dec 17.5 and Jan 16 F calls are going to the moon, and I will ride that rocket all the way.

I'm done with TSLA for the moment.  The volatility it's giving me isn't worth the premium on the calls.

As is tradition 🙄 will be huge when it does
how come ruthless is an often used word but not the opposite.

for example: John is pretty ruthless but Jane on the other hand is very ruth.
Because the antonym isn’t Ruth, it’s ruthful or rueful, both stemming from the verb “rue” meaning to regret, and rueful is used semiregularly.
“I don’t regret this decision, but I both rue and lament it.” - Fry season 1.

One of my favorite lines in existence
Futurama was a great show
Love the thought process, but ruth basically means dread, and to be ruthless is to cast away all sentiment of ones actions that could cause that feeling
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unpaired_word

Edit: oh shit, apparently ruthful is a real word…
How can I check how stocks are doing in foreign markets?

I’m gonna be completely honest I have like no social media but can pinpoint what they all do, I have not a fucking clue what Pinterest is for I can’t be the only one who is like this
They show up as useless results on Google image search that have no description or relation to the query. 

Also maybe for Karens and women who are into artsy stuff I guess
Agreed! Useless - when they show up on a search result! Pins go to zero.

PTON GOING DOWN LIKE CHEGG & ZILLOW
Kinda mum in here.
Man i miss yugioh. If they ever had something where everything from syncro monsters on was banned, id drop bags on a deck just to play
One of my wishes is that they make a triple AAA Yu-gi-oh game in VR.
jesus im not even into VR but I would be if they made that 100%
I watched it ironically on cable after school since my buddy was poor. Good times
the original and GX were my shit
Blue eyes white dragon is all I remember and his buddy pulling out other super dragons. Maybe?
In middle school a group of friends and I were so invested in it we battled each other over the phone in like 3 way
yeah, i got back into it a bit in highschool when duelingnetwork was still a thing with a couple of my good buds. Tons of fun and so much rage lol
I kinda want to get back in but the game looks way too complicated for me now
yeah id put up with syncros and xyzs, they were easy to understand even if annoying, but the first time i saw pendulum summons i noped the fuck outta there. too much shit
tbh this kinda helps me understand the stock market these days
people dropping money on some way overvalued shit and still having fun and resale value? yeah sounds like this crazy ass bull market lol
Duel links is p2w so master duel will proabably be bad, The new anime series are mediocare as well, sad to see the game die off like this especially when other popular childhood games like pokemon are doing better than ever
Yeah it is sad, the show quality is real real bad and the game just had too much power creep as they introduced new mechanics imo
Yeah they do power creep so their always a new pack to buy, ruins game but keeps whales
yeah i tried to go to a tournament once in highschool and got completely rocked by someone with pendulum summons when i didnt even know those existed lol. Honestly wouldn't even mind if they scrapped a bunch of shit and made a new "cannon" collection of cards or something just as a restart
I call on Pot of Greed!
mods, ban this man! (unless you gunna let me have mirror force uwu)
Magic is a better game in every single respect and it’s still dogshit.
Not true. If you want to play a format where everything is OTK combo with 0 interaction or resources then yu gi oh is for you 🤡🤡🤡
If I wanna drop a mint on cardboard pictures to tell someone else they lose, I’ll keep it in mind.
fo sho. Whole game is basically pre-Looting ban Dredge but on crack and every deck functions the same regardless of archetype
I mean, if you're playing like bo5 sets, then I actually do like that lol
yeah but i dont wanna learn an entire new game

closest i got was into hearthstone and shit but i didnt wanna buy expansions to be competitive

i did have fun when patron warrior was busted... HEY EVERYONE GET IN HERE
The best and worst part of magic is the stack. Hearthstone was fine but not being able to act on your opponents turn and completely blow them out with an ambush of some kind made the game feel miserable. I haven’t played either in a couple years, but if I picked up anything again, it would be magic.
I've been tempted by magic in the past, but never willing to take the dive on the learning curve
If you want to get started, the closest thing to hearthstone is probably monogreen. You ramp your mana, pump your creatures, and you give them trample so you can’t be blocked. The systems are really elegant, it was pretty fun to learn them, and the colors give a lot of identity to their cards, it’s impressive how well they’ve honed in on that theme. There are obvious power colors, but every color has strengths.

Game is still shit though, I mostly got captivated by the amazing art.
> I mostly got captivated by the amazing art.

lol yeah this is why ive been browsing yugioh cards for the past like half hour, i loved the art

though youve got me thinking about giving magic a shot for real. At one point i got one of those free intro decks from a gaming shop by me, might see if thats still laying around just to learn the basics of the game. im off work for a bit (aka quit my job and waiting for my new offer in writing) so itd be a good time to learn
Magic arena is free and on mobile, so there’s not really a downside. The art is like, 10x better than yugioh. Look at the bodies in the hand of [this diregraf collossus](https://images.app.goo.gl/bAVnbBQK4ieqSKxs6)
alright, downloading it tomorrow after my exam lol

if i end up dropping bags on cards though, i might have to come after you
If they are good cards (irl cards) then there is a huge secondhand market for them, something could be banned in standard but legal in modern and then people who play that format get copies. It’s not impossible to actually recoup your money or even make money speculating on new sets, it’s got built in stonks in paper magic.
i already have options and sports betting, dont tempt me lmao
Eh it’s easy. Just cards follow rules and you can create combos that break games and end them in a few turns.

It’s just chess with illustrations and numbers
hmmmm.... maybe

if they had elemental heros id be in in a heartbeat lmao
Fans generate card content too, it’s like comics. 

Magic is also publicly traded company.

It’s a literal money printer. They just print fucken images on paper in certain numbers, fans get ahold of them and just like any video game they figure out insane shit and break the game.

This drives the demand for super rare cards up. They buy more packs in hopes until the market is too saturated and sales decline.

New season of cards comes out. Repeat
> publicly traded company.

welp im sold
Retard question, I had roughly $5k cash sitting in my Schwab account, placed orders for like 7 different calls, only 3 filled for roughly $1500, the next day Schwab is like "here's the details on your $1500 margin purchase"

I had the TV on Bloomberg. Coffee in hand and Reddit open. You can miss this shit.
In hindsight taper is a sign of the adults trying to do the right thing. 

Markets approved
Put $Z
don't think you missed the boat?

now...OTM OPEN puts for next week? I got those.
I sold them to you and used the premium to buy calls🤷‍♂️
I bet jimmy chill could beat the shit outta 80% of you easy
~~cocaine strength~~ old man strength
I’ve got 11 inches on him, and probably 70 pounds. I would go to prison for elder abuse.
I was heavy in Spy puts... and then JPOW started speaking. I saw it ran up so I sold it quickly and bought JPM calls. Still down today but could have been much worse.
is it too late to jump on the NVAX train?
Better to wait and get puts, this thing drops like a rock when the time comes
Nah. But wait for pullback it is overbought
you to be well educated about it, do you think it'll 4x?
Couple of approvals are there. So rally will be there but it went 33% remember its not like tesla to rally for months. I think we see good pullback, if you gonna buy calls wait for 2 or 3 days watch for the pullback then get in. 

It didnt stay 200 today for that very reason
I can’t sleep. Like there’s something big happening tomorrow. Guess I’ll just rub one out.
Good call
It’s nnn dude

Really tho
Wait, they 'earn'?
Is $ISEE going to make me rich? Wtf is this Diamond in the rough??
Any tips how to play earnings? There are few nice opportunities tomorrow.
Don’t
For real, it's dicey

That said, holding calls for SQ and OXY friday.
That's no fun
I’m all seriousness, just buy whatever you’re thinking 30 minutes after the bell, day after earninfs
Uber at open sell before close

SQ at open sell before close

Coinbase at open and keep it till tomorrow before close.
Always play the run up and sell before, always short INTC cause they're guaranteed 10% drop. Other than that actually holding earnings is kind of a coinflip depending on the ticker, look at past earnings dates to get a general feel if it pumps or dumps. 

Also generally play credit spreads if you're dealing with Thursday AH/Friday PM earnings since unless your contract goes ITM by a decent amount IV crush will kill it.

Amc Q3 earnings
I think I should sell NET before earning, WSB thinks I should sell NET before earnings.. I probably shouldn’t
You really think net deserves this valuation?
They keep improving their mix of customers each quarter (winning contracts with larger and larger companies) which is really as import or more important than the actual revenue amount but fuck me if I know what it's worth. I got in at 65 and now I'm more worried about the tax bill than a pull back.
Yes you are 100% right.


But it is worth to note that they are still net income negative. And even with increasing revenue, the net income is worsening
Net income is gamed for high growth companies like NET. Delaying or accelerating hiring can swing that for them(just one example). They are staying negative because once you go positive, analysts start expecting it to always improve. This boxes management into managing 2 different line items as well as when and how you spend to get growth.
Totally, but the marketing expenses is growing at (approximately) the same rate as revenue, it’s eating so much revenue.

So how would they turn this into profit? Will they be able to retain customers once they decrease their incentives? 

I love NET I just want to have a full picture on them
 I am asking myself the same questions, but then I saw TSLA and NKLA 😆
Do 75% of things deserve theirs?
Yes ok you make a good point!

Everyone assumes the fed will do everything to protect assets classes and the stock market. Extreme deflation is not priced in, neither is the either side, hyperinflation. You can't price something in if you thought you had it undercontrol but anyways
doesn't hyperinflation just make the market go vertical?

SPY 100k?
> I'm not a fan of that theory.
When a company's customers can't afford to buy anything because prices have skyrocketed, do you think that'll help or hurt their fundamentals?

Trick question, fundamentals don't matter in this market. Hyperinflation and deflation are both extremely bullish.

Okay you austists, who made over 500% on their OCGN options by buying the 10$ strike last week like I told them. Don't worry if u missed out on OCGN cause I got the next Biopharmaceutical play for you that will make you rich. ETON getting FDA Approval Friday, this company will be 10+ on friday once they got the approval. How am I certain they will get FDA approval is that they delayed it 3 months from August to November so that they could submit all the information necessary to the FDA, this is exactly what happened with CCXI which I had posted about a month ago. They are getting FDA approval for Topiramate Oral Solution which would have a huge market cap of 800 million and it will be the first liquid solution. THE VOLUME IS 4x its daily volume with 900k shares traded today compared to its usual volume of 250k. Last chance to buy in tomorrow before FDA APPROVAL FRIDAY

Make the price go down but value goes up
Before fractional shares became a thing, it made  the stock more accessible to retail investors. Some brokers still don't have fractional shares

I lived in California and she lived near Detroit lol. She was my dream white girl tho

That’s mostly why she left me. She wanted me to move there, she knew I never would tho. She lived in middle of bum fuck nowhere

Yeah you did. You just gotta crush it from the back and ask her whose pussy this is, and she says yours daddy, and then you say you’re goddamn right it’s mine, and then you beat it up till her legs give out, push her down to prone bone and bust balls deep, easy as pie.

Well the market cap is supposed to be higher than Apple, Tesla just hasn’t got a fair shake of the stick yet as investors have not realized it’s fair market value. Should be around 3 trillion I believe, that seems pretty fair, maybe a little on the conservative side though.
I got a 1300 call expiring Friday for tesla. Currently already up 20%
Move that sht quick or theta gang is gonna come for you
Wym by "move that shit quick" ?
Sell and take the 20 percent profit

I'm not selling shit I got these calls for cheap I'm holding till Friday

You could be like me and sell Gme $245P and $230P at a $700 loss and that shit would have ran up by $6000 if I sold at the Gme lows today. I bought in when Gme was up 18% and sold 10 mins later at a loss when it went up to 21%

The market is never going to correct again. It's just going up until the shareholders treat the non-shareholders as slaves.
What kind of market are we in you ask? I just paid $40 to have a salad delivered on door dash
$40? Are you retarded?
R&R, Rich and Retarded
I spent 20 bucks to have 2 coffees from dunkin dashed. Never again.
We live in a market where people will pay $40 to have a salad delivered to their door. Your lazy ass could have picked it up yourself for $10.
Or made one for $5
Also yes. Although, I think buying a salad from the store is worth it just to not have a bunch of left over ingredients when you just want one salad. But I'll only pay a delivery fee if I'm absolutely shit housed and can't drive to pick it up.
That high cost is transitory, bruh.
We live in the most pseudo capitalist bullshit ever and lie to ourselves about it. The government subsidizes and prints money like it grows on trees when it should let the markets do their thing. This type of fraud capitalism makes the wealthy impossibly rich while those living check to check keep getting double buttfucked by inflation and stagnant wages.

Main requirement to join the S&P 500:

>last reported quarter must be profitable ✅

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ✅

Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in todays economy.

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 10-20 unprofitable loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy constantly and always follows profits.

100 call leaps purchased on July 21 for $330 are up to $613 which is $28k profit https://i.imgur.com/w1sNbwg.png

Bring back Craigslist casual encounters
*Saw you in the grocery store today. You were behind the cash register. You told me 'Hello Sir' and thats when I knew you wanted to suk sum dik. Message me the price of the rope, scotch tape and cleaning products I bought so I know it's you*
What about missed connections? 😞
I can't stand Facebook marketplace. Craigslist is straight forward, when I look up AMG C63 that's what it would bring up, not a bunch of predictive bullshit from their algorithm. I do not want a Maserati. Ever. But marketplace is where all the stuff is, so what choice do I have?
Everyone bragging about having $25k+ accounts…

If you wanna impress me, move to San Francisco
You need 25k account to be just a San Francisco bum
But aren’t you from queens/Brooklyn?
San Francisco is way more expensive. I live in Brooklyn in a nice neighborhood, rent $2200 for a 2bed. Not too bad compared to Manhattan or SanFran
I was referring to his username.  Damnnnn you pay $2,200 to live in two closets?  Get outta NY dude, that’s a mortgage payment.
It's not as bad as you'd think. Typically you're getting paid a lot more compared to the same jobs in rural. Percentage-wise, it works out about the same as when I lived in way cheaper places. About %30 of the household monthly income goes to rent and home-bills. The rest goes to RobbingHood....
[deleted]
Oh queens trash
No, you’re thinking of staten Island.
Oh 🥴
[deleted]
N poor
No thanks I'm not a _________
Honestly 25k should be the buy-in to be on this sub, doesn't matter if you lose it all but actually having that money to start with to show you are actually putting something on the line.

Also would rather not downsize to a broom closet in the hood. Even San Jose is retardedly valued. If you are in tech and don't work remotely you ain't black.
[deleted]
I guess we need both to keep this place going, maybe I just want like a high stakes poker back room here with vetted members
I wouldn't move to San Fran if I had 2 mill in my fun money account. A nice place in the Rockies is good with me, spend the rest on guns and cars.
Why would you even want to move to that shithole? Move to Wall Street or something asinine like that
probably going to fomo into some spy calls and get f'n rekt

What do these numbers mean? I see them everywhere
Is cheesecake factory a good spot for a first date?
Dude hit something original, like a good restaurant he may have never been to before
Better than Wendy’s
I usually just go down to the quarry and throw rocks and stuff down there
Chains are not a good look outside of the bedroom, find a local joint
I usually do taco bells but sure
I only take women on first dates to restaurants with an EPS >1
lol you see that post about you 2 post down? literally just read it
No… small pizza shop.
Much better if you show her the factory where they make cheese. Tell her you were originally gonna go to cheesecake factory but you're a real ass dude who does real ass shit
Wait you all get dates!? I usually just jerk off to my loss porn.
> Yes, you can set your own date.
OCGN- you piece of shit stock. I thought we were bros.

Ok there is a small chance that she comes out ahead, but absolutely no one can say that it was a good idea 😂
Bruh when is it time to pullback a bit
Pullback only intraday from now on.
That was yesterday
Just need a catalyst. Something to really set it off, some sort of negative news story, and we certainly have plenty of recent gain to wipe out.
Bears never learn. They deserve this
I’m soooo stupid. Dumped my COIN 🪙 shares at 240 about a month ago to start wheeling ROKU. Lost out on $70k worth of gains trying be smart 😭😭😭 should have just held on to the COIN shares
I sold around 215….
Portfolio has been green for too many days.

Gonna hold these calls longer than I should and sell for a loss.
This market will never close red ever again for the rest of our lifetimes

what is this and what does it mean
Long dick style
the last few hours of TSLA call buying was face meltingly ridiculous, we are absolutely going to 1500 and maybe beyond as long as elon stays out of the way
Prob not. They’ll do an offering soon and send the stock plummeting back to the 900s
yeah we could get an event driven reversal, no one knows. but this is a perfect storm of retail idiots, systematic momentum funds and panic-buying by huge institutions who are hedging against a true infinite squeeze. we could see unimaginable numbers
Tesla short interest is at all time low, though. Retail can’t hold it up forever.
it's not a short squeeze, it's a gamma squeeze. SI is irrelevant, and my point is retail is not driving this. It's institutions at this point

it could easily pop, I'm not actually making a firm prediction. I'm saying the right tail risk of an insane melt up is getting bigger by the day. $1500 is possible but not probable, $2500 is remotely possible

just a tip, you should try to learn from people like me

more single-stock call option dollar delta traded in the last hour on TSLA than any other asset in history as far as I can tell. if retail dominance is a counter indicator, you're safe to buy

Welp, I’m gonna get higher than an astronaut’s dick off some of these dabs that were mixed up in a Mexican bathtub by a Chinese 6 year old, then gamble my money away on 1 DTE GME and AMC calls, then rub one out to my favorite Kathie Wood butthole pic, whilst I watch the wife get railed by Fernando the pool boy on the spycam they know is there. I know they know because no matter what room I hide it in they always grab it and take it with them to the room they do be doin the bidness in. (We ain’t even gotta fuckin pool…I digress.) Then for lunch I’m gonna hit the dumpster behind Wendy’s. Not because there’s food there; the fuckin hobos take care of that. Again, I digress. I go behind the dumpster cause Two Ton Tom (the day manager) pays me 20$ for a blowie and 20$ is twenty fuckin dollars, ya feel me? Then ima cruise on back home just in time to sell my calls at 97% loss. That’s dafuq I’m doin.

with inflation, yes. TSLA hitting 1 million is possible
America's economy is the best it has ever been, it is the strongest in the world, and it will continue to be for the next 100 years plus. Inflation is over exaggerated and 30 trillion in debt is miniscule compared to our future growth. Large market corrections are not needed anymore moving forward.

Ordered 2 original chicken sandwiches from Burger King at work.

Yeah do it
The best. Like blowjobs from dudes
Oh yeah that’s the best feeling ever
Those aren’t the chi’king or whatever, right? I had one of those chi’kings the other day and it didn’t even taste fully cooked.
Nah it’s the old school original chicken sandwich. Grilled chicken not fried
The long hoagie roll sandwich with the breaded long chicken patty is the "Original chicken sandwich" at BK. I don't even think my local BK has a grilled chicken sandwich at the moment.
Y’all make this too complicated lol, it’s literally called the original chicken sandwich on the menu. Looks like a mini sub with long patty. That’s the best one. Fuck all these fried chicken sandwiches
had the Ch'king once, very hesitant to try again. drenched in hard breading and sauce, and not enough meat in the ratio.
See I get way too much meat but the sauce was vile and the pickles were gross. It would have been a good amount of meat if it didn’t taste fucking raw.
ok, a friend really enjoyed it. Since your description sounds counter to mine, I guess I will try it again 👍
I mean, you definitely don’t have to, it just means they have multiple ways to fuck it up.

What's the likelihood Jerome is buying calls through an untraceable LLC or some other vehicle that keeps him hidden. Is it 100% or a 110% chance.

Paraphrasing a bit but not too off:

"What do you tell Americans facing large and rapidly rising costs?"

"I care deeply about struggling Americans, but it has nothing to do with the Fed.  It's supply constraints and temporary out of our control."

I discovered the most autistic subreddit on reddit. It's called r/burryology and it's dedicated to Michael Burry's DD and "greatness". Go to the subreddit and search for Tesla, the autism is eye-watering in every post. Elon Musk infuriates them, especially when they have to talk about people who made money buying Elon's stock. They all agree that Tesla would be overvalued at $50 since they make less cars than some other car company. There is a guy buying hundreds of LEAP TSLA 50P, as some sort of exercise in self torture I assume. Amazing.
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

Would you date 7 years older?
I'd date older but not younger. Holy shit young women are annoying/infuriating. Actually just young people in general. So obnoxious. You really gotta wait until they're in at least their early to mid thirties and they've chilled out and they're not all about loud parties and boring holes in their brains with alcohol
Not normally, but since you’re asking, I can make an exception with your mom
I did, if you're in you're 20s fuck no. She'll want to settle down and you're still in your twenties. If you're in you're 30s meh it'll probably work out fine
19 - 22 year old thots or nada

There are no datable women over the age of 28. They all fall from the old tree and hit every branch on the way down. Asians get a +5 modifier for their skin.

Hahaha would he do that to you? If he won’t, I will. Go jog. Go go go! 👀 She was wearing black Lulu’s and a cute lace black thong. I took my time sniffing her through her leggings, then through the thong, by the time they were both off I was about done 🥴😂

IDK how market is going to react or what SEC will do but please share, automod keeps deleting my screenshot of it and I believe the founder will delete the tweet at some point
Definitely don’t link people to it or screenshot

Nice, thanks bro
Share with other traders like your self
mods put my post back up with the screen shot i think
dm screenshot
Let me get in first
Is it illegal to say your company is profitable? I don't know how this SEC shit works.
well they haven't been profitable yet for one, so that's material non-public information

also this was in the context of their home flipping business, which everyone is curious about given how the market reacted to Zillow getting fukt. knowledge of this info is also material non public imo
Well I know how I'm going to react, gonna buy some shares tomorrow.
Well fuck my puts that i was gunna sell at open tomorrow
i mean if the foudner is this loose lips

he definitely tipped off anyone that would matter. this might still somehow be priced in. maybe idk but this founder def a fucking loose lip ass fool
Oil is about to pull an undertaker
did anyone really expect a cartel to be like "ok guys we'll produce more barrels to make it cheaper for you all just because you asked nicely lol"
What did these morons think. God I hate Oil futures traders and the dipshits who make the article headlines. Oil is gonna keep climbing higher until supply returns to the market which isn’t happening any time soon. Demand isn’t going anywhere either but up.

Tesla up 30$ after hours what in the actual FUCK! I'm selling my 1300 calls at open to lock in my bagger fuck that!!!!! I been here before
It will be 10 bagger if you hold till it expires
I remember someone commented about how "girls have it so easy" earlier today in this thread and his reasoning was a 6/10 girl could easily find a sugar daddy

don't ever wanna see that complaint again because what is Elon to us if not a sugar daddy
The last paragraph got me 😂😂😂
Dang, your right and here I am complaining about my wife's boyfriend.  I feel so hipocritical now

I once dreamt that a bunch of mice were tying me down to my bed and when I woke up i was stuck and couldn't move or scream for help. I fell back asleep to the same dream 2x and each time I would still be tied up in my dream right where i left off, with a bunch of mice climbing all over me, then waking up not being able to move or talk..

I finally woke up screaming my head off after a few minutes of that shit. Ever since then i been like Fuck Mice
If I get torn from a dream I always close my eyes again and try to find the exact position I was laying in taking it from the top. It’s worked once or twice.
I once woke up twice in like 4 hour time span and returned to the dream both times. In the dream I was even explaining to the people in my dream how I came back. lol bonkers
If you study up on lucid dreaming being able to jump back into dreams to continue them or repeat a similar past dream is easier than full on lucid dreaming itself.
It’s called the metaverse and it’s coming.
As the great man David Goggins once said, you only need 3-4 hours of sleep and anything more is just you being a lazy sack of shit. Also who is gonna carry the fucking boats?
That dude could use another rem cycle.
Gme, always been the play.

Watch us while you holler at the moon 🌚
To those who don’t know already, I’m an avid believer of buying the dip. That being said, Zillow is not the dip you wanna buy. I told people the housing market was a clown show like back in Q1 and I knew that it wasn’t going to last. Zillow went full regarded, enough said. You never go full regard, except on FDs as mandated by the ten crack commandments.
A well regarded avant-garde retard
Mind=blown
🥰
Home prices will never go down though. At most, it'll just go up more slowly.

Median home price in the US will be $1 million eventually.
It will crash to a new “higher low” on the long term charts. Then go up in to a new bubble we will see probably in the next decade. Rinse and repeat. There will come a time to buy cheap housing/building
Up 12% today 🥂
#$CAKE TO $55 after hours tonight
I read your spamming of this stock and took a small position to limit loss in case. Good luck
Best of luck my brother. I like the cake and stock
I mean GOT DAMN! at this point I can’t even look at myself in the mirror
Imagine not buying VIX calls at 15$ 🤡🤡
What a close. Woot Woot!!!
Wait for SPY to drop some and then buy calls.
Gonna be waiting a while. Stonks only go up because we're tapering
I just bought 125 SPY calls exp 12/1 $500C 


Let’s see what happens ….
holy shit no wonder the market is flying 

y’all are gamma squeezing the shit out of everything lmao
They were $.04/contract. If we get to $475 I expect that to increase considerably
Corn uptrend + delta hedging + short covering = me counting my tendies on RIOT tomorrow.

&#x200B;

Corn declines + delta release + more shorts = me sad.
$CORN...now there is a name I have not  heard in a long time.  Still trading around $20 I assume...
Anyone have any ideas on why we went up today?
Gravity idiot
Spyyyy rockets in flight, afternoon delight
The last time I FOMOed Tesla calls end of day I got crushed the following morning.

So, naturally, I did it again today.  

I am the definition of insanity
I can’t believe TSLA. I simply can’t believe it
I know right why would anyone buy it after it ripped up so crazy then stalled
Is the IWM breakout real??
i hope so, im in 11/12 250c
C'mon Roku tank for me please
UP 25% today!  Which is good because I had some bad options last week and lost 25% last week...so I should be righ....wait...fuck you math...why do you got to do me so dirty.
Realized 20% gains on a leaps today, and i feel ok
I’ve been doing this with tech. Buying 2-3 months out and selling on spikes for 15-25%
Stock continued rising too. And i almost made a fomo buy, but didnt pull the trigger. I think ive prestiged
If you have spy 90-180 dte when do you take profit?
The odds of another Zillow plunge after hours? I just need one more.....just one more.
I got ROKU calls and ETSY puts lol wtf why
I'm so sorry bro... been there.
Should have bought that ROKU put I was looking at.

Ragret.
fist me fsly daddy, don't give me hope
Casted back into the market. 🙏
Idk a single person who watches roku 😂
That's because they keep losing popular apps and services
Welp. Sold fastly too early.
Between 0DTE puts and OCGN today was bloody. Hopefully I have some play money for SQ puts
I went all in on FSLY 50p lol
To be fair…they’ve tanked the past couple of earnings so…
Lots of profit taking at the end. Thinking I should have done the same.
So is the market finally coming to terms that the 2010s highs are over and that we’re in an inflationary recession or what?
If share prices go up but inflation outstrips them, do you lose money?
Lol thank god i sold roku for a small profit last week
Office homies doin the stanky leg. Whole fuckin floor bought ROKU puts
Rip those fsly puts
ROKU LMAO. The one time I buy a put on earnings it works out.
strike and expiry? Be cautious of IV crush,.
CEO sold 131,000 shares not too long ago. Anyone buying calls for earnings was a brave soul.
Totally! Last earnings when I held FSLY calls
It dumped like frikking anything! And this earnings when I’m holding ROKU, it dips
Hard and FSLY rips 😥😥😥😥
Motherfucker, my fastly calls never executed
FCEL PUTS STILL.

it was the top, right guys? 🥲
Well, for today, yeah. Tomorrow at open though? Doubt it.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Pullback will happen, slight correction...But once that comes we're going straight to 470. I keep telling myself I'll catch that swing and flip to calls, but I just get butt fucked
BRUH
I should really think about selling my SOFI calls. They're up over 350%. This is going to be a really stupid expensive lesson, but the potential upside is still too high.
Sell half of them. Or sell one every day or something.
I think it closes under 23 Friday. No way that many calls end up in the money. Including some covered's I sold :D
i piled in with the $CAKE guy - thanks for the tip - good call..
It’s dumping? He said buy calls right?? Lmao
Also what his name
Can someone summarize Jerome Powell today
Buy stocks, profit.

#I have ascended
who would’ve guessed that amazon fire stick company couldn’t justify 191 P/E ratio!!!???
Z had a nice strong close, hopefully I'm not fucked hwre
Pretty sure that was shorts covering lol. 

Careful trying to catch falling knifes.
Given the gravity of the ER, I think zillow has a bit more room to fall, I mean. look at what happened to CHGG, if their CEO wasn't an idiot they would have whipsawed already. Zillow on the other hand, FUCKED up big.
Agreed. I think this goes sub $60 easy.
I know but even with all the analyst price cuts it's still targeted around $100 so I felt confident in buying some but I think I bought to much. 60% of my portfolio is in Z shares at $68, yikes.
LETS GOOOOO FUCK U ROKUUUUUU
Bought more $DIS.  Now have 1k shares.  The approval of the COVID vaccine for ages 5+ is going to be a BIG BIG deal for Disney's parks, hotels, and cruise lines in Q4.
Are you selling covered calls?
not with earnings right around the corner.  history has proved that as an unwise move for me lol
Ah yeah that probably wouldn’t be wise
ROKU’s earnings were actually quite good. Wtf
So now do the bers believe that everything is priced in?
Thank fuck I didn’t play earnings today
Anyone ready for Square and Coinbase earnings?
Me. Also interested in the shareholder vote sq is holding tonight about the after pay deal.
whens coins, ive seen places say on the 8th but also seen for the 5th
Watching the market rise as JPow speaks is like watching your favourite team thrash their rivals. So satisfying.
It’s nice that the market went up, but it doesn’t make sense to me. JP says Tapering will start, preventing more money from being injected into the market, and yet the market spikes? Okie dokie.
Fuck off roku you are a meme.
Why is Tesla so high? 😂
Stock price too high IMO
Elon? That you?
11/5 2k TSLA call still in play!

Wow today's earnings are rigged as fuck. No 10 baggers.
SKLZ shat the bed. 
Earlier today I bought back the covered calls I sold at a 500% loss, thinking it would moon after earnings 🤡 
Had I just let them bee, they’d have expired worthless. 

Sigh.
I thought earnings looked good.
Me too. But it’s selling off hard. I’m holding my commons and my LEAPS. Still a young company that is trying to find its feet
Not to mention, Cathie dumped it
in the future if you want to close covered calls, sell your shares at the same time (you'll still realize most of your gain)... fomoing into buying to close your own calls, especially at a substantial loss, is usually not a good move

as always, ymmv
Fstly
I really wanted to buy 500 shares of Sofi before close but I forgot
How do I turn my gay bear tears amounting to 3k, into 7k profits. I need real help. My house is on the line.
Obviously not by gambling, you’re shit at it.
Does this 7g really need to be in the next few weeks honestly? Chasing it is gonna burn you further. Just come up with a realistic slow boomer plan for a while and be honest with yourself and your family
Thanks. I will try and not chase. I am so fucking depressed. I cant think. I appreciate your kind words more than you know. Really. I am in fucking pieces.
I know, we all fuck it up from time to time. Definitely not time to chase losses. I really hope it works out for you and you're back in the green soon
thank you stranger. makes my heart a little warmer. and the pain a little less sharp
You can do this man
CLNE gang, wats your predication on earnings and movement?
Forgot im holding 20 calls lol
Lemonade is expanding to car insurance today
gas is up by $1 in my area. $XOM MOON?
F to my Roku 400 calls. However they expire in March so not sure if I should cut the losses or diamond hand.
Dont give up
Well I'm getting banned Friday
FUBO Sportsbook just went live!!!
When market drops I will load with calls
So cash gang for a few months?
Only 50% gain for last month, if load all cash in, should 500% profit
Bro, you had all fucking week to load calls.
come back in June then
We'll send you thoughts and prayers from Mars

Holding $8k in BA calls expiring tomorrow and just realized I’ll be on a plane at market open. Wish me luck

My QCOM 155c gonna be iv crushed
[deleted]
I have $71 SPYG calls 10/19...ITM soon??
Not so FSLY!
Tesla's market cap increased in 5 days enough to buy Daimler(Mercedes) company. Might as well buy them.
What’s the word on GME sells for a little profit or hold out hope it’ll go back up ?
run away and don't look back
Calls…..they expire Friday
I’d probably sell/roll out to a later date. I have several but I’m holding Nov 12 till Friday. Hard to say with GME. Generally we see a pretty good run up after these small jumps. I suspect we will be testing $350 again soon…with or without a announcement.
Sell you fool
Atvi finally moving a blip ah
Anyone else theta ganging DraftKings
Might sell a 50p

What y'all know about TWLO
Profit taking 100%
Anybody ever bought property(land or house) at a young age? Like <26yrs? I want to buy so bad but it seems like a bad idea because I plan on moving around. Realistically I should wait but I feel like by the time i’m “ready” interest rates won’t be so low
Yes, I bought a 3-story row house from a Philadelphia sheriff sale, a hobo snuck in and burned it down, now I own a vacant lot.
The problem here was buying property in Philly.
I bought my first house at 24. I own lake shore property now too.
Rental property is lame. Just use the money to buy shares and sell converse calls
I did, rented it out when I was moving around. Renters trashed it for me. Sold it and made a bunch of money, if I held on to it I would have made a ton more.
If you can buy a rental and have someone else maintain, then go for it, especially in a college town
My brother bought a bunch of acreage in his twenties and just plunked down a mobile home for a few years, then sold the land back for like 35% more than what he bought it for when he got married and wanted to buy a house. I wish I had more info
Land is always good to buy, depends on where but yea. Same time tho houses r overpriced asf rn
Just get a 30 Year loan, and refinance after 3-5 years.

Do NOT sit in your 30 year
Bought first house at 22 in the military, if you want to move around don't sweat it just rent it out and build your networth
Bought 1st house at 23. Lived there 7 years, rented for 3 and sold during covid for way too much
I dont think Roku ER justifies the stock dropping 10% they beat EPS by a mile and missed revenue by 3 million don‘t think it will stay at -10%
This earning season has not been forgiving.

AMD smashed earnings and was down for 4 days in a row.
Woke up this morning to an upgrade on RACE and my calls up 400% from where they were the night before, which was already twice what I paid for them.

That's difference making money.  I might be able to do something with that kind of cash.  Messed with my head.  Does that mean I'm not a virgin any more?

Yeah but who the hell is buying at 295
I feel dirty everytime I come in here... (That's why I like it )

oh no Roku plz stay broku thanks
is a -40% portfolio loss irredeemable
Just get a 2 bagger regard
Nah, I had an 80% portfolio loss like 9 months ago, made almost all of it back in the last month or 2. It’s never as hopeless as it seems.
Hell naw you just need to double up
No
If you stop trading
I made it back from 50% down in the beginning of the week with NVDA calls
Stop following advise you read here and you can recover in less than 2 months.
Nvda, tsla, vld keeping me green. Buy calls 6 months out and hold. GL

#TOUCH MY CAMERA THROUGH THE FENCE
Where are the bodies Garth!?
Loaded to the tits in ABNB calls. Wondering if airline issues are going to be a problem for them or if car travel will still hold up some good revenue on their end. I've used five since 2021 started, and most of my friends are traveling again.
Bullish I use it all the time
CAKE missed expectations damn
damn forreal

everytime i pass by one there's always a huge line
MRO, wake up.
I have 300 $17 calls
Holy shit, I just need Roku to stay below 300 for my 300 put please. Fucking hell, I' not going to sleep tonight.
No worries.. it’s finding resistance at $288. You got this! Good luck🤞
$CAKE: 40% gain year after year compared 3rd quarter last year. To me, it sounds a huge deal. On top of that, they are mostly pack  every night with avg 45 mins wait. On top of that, we are entering the holiday season. Things will only get better from here.
I always get drunk at CAKE on Christmas Eve.  Come home reaking of scotch and usually pass out in the Xmas tree.  If I'm lucky I don't piss all over the few presents we can afford.
DKNG gang wya? This price action is boring as hell
This shit is trash. If it doesn’t go up 8%+ on earnings I’m selling
Reporting in 1400 shares. Why is it flat loo
Market to the companies: how dare you report your results for the quarter? I'll crush you!
I'd make more money as a gold bug
I sold my 460c on Tuesday for a modest profit. Can I have them back please?
In Septem🐻 I bought 12/31 460c for $200 and sold them when SPY got back to 450
Well I’m broke again. Anybody know the tax implications of pulling money out of an IRA? May need to do this to avoid a Margin Call
Yeah you pay a fuck ton of taxes
You get taxed on it like income, but you also get a penalty depending on the set up. You can take a loan against yourself
Wdym take a loan against yourself??
Yeah it's penalty free and even the little interest you pay, gets paid to you. I would ask your people about it.
Would Fidelity know what i’m talking about?
I have taken loans out with Fidelity 401ks before, they'll be able to make it happen. It's a way around the penalty thing, but you do have to do pay it back, at least a tiny bit at a time.
what’s the usual APR and timeline
Probably 6 or 7 percent right now, and the terms are up to you, to a point, but usually in increments of 1 year.
Yea it’s going to hurt. Ordinary income plus penalty. Probably 50c on the dollar minimum.

Nike was my only green swing in the past 3 months
Your only green swing in the last 3 months? What the fuck have you been buying?
I had a little moment where the only thing i bought was workhorse
For about a month I was all in on my Options account in NKE and NUE. They were both good to me.

(1) highly extended due to undersupply fears from recent weather events; (2) price recently catapulted three standard deviations above the 20-year mean (+2.5% annualized) trendline (+55% YTD); (3) the price will correct substantially due to demand destruction caused by this massive run-up

how do you guys feel about trying to use volume flows as indicators? ive been using it for a month, and im only hitting about 50/50.   


what i really need is a second indicator, because when i pick out 4 stocks i like,i end up picking the two that dont soar. guess its time to dust off the crystal ball
50/50 eh? so basically the same as guessing?

Conspiracy: The Facebook whistleblower was Zuck’s plan the whole time so they could urge Congress to regulate the industry and harm small social media platforms so Facebook can use its abundant resources to avoid regulation and continue to monopolize the industry and avoid having to continue buying out competition
lol definitely not because "small social media companies" don't exist and there's no way measures wouldn't be targeted specifically at facebook. any small competitors that do exist probably wouldn't be affected.
> The first part of your comment is a link to an article on the website wallstreetbets.
it is not. sorry, raybot.
I guess I’m a conspiracy theorist too! It’s pretty obvious from a few details that this was planned. First the media treated her like a goddess second she had a hearing in front of Congress the next day Third she gave ideas on how to regulate Facebook more, I mean like which whistleblower starts saying their ideas and then Congress likes the idea. Rant over.
> which whistleblower starts saying their ideas and then Congress likes the idea

like all of them? lol. literally anything that is called "the [organization] papers" has followed this general storyline.

I'm thinking of yoloing into SRNE. I already have a large position that's red, and I think today's positive movement represents a steady incline to the $15 mark. This is based on today's news about Brazil approving and (pending) orders Covid tests. It's also 15% shorted. Am I a retard?
A number of things could happen but my   spidey sense says $OPEN kills earnings and  shits the bed anyways.
What about Moderna? should we go all in?
Staying away from moderna. Have had 2 shares for months that sailed to $500 and back down to basically where I bought them and then I lost like 4k in call options on it when everything crashed in September (I had bought them 2 days before). It used to be my favorite stock when I had $2000 in my account, since it basically moved my account into the green or red everyday (usually green) so it was fun to watch, now I couldn't care less about those 2 shares or what moderna does

I’m making up for all my losses this year with my SPY 459c 11/19 I’m sitting on now. And I’m not waiting 3x to sell I’ll be happy with 1x
1x is not a gain
Ok you know what I mean I’ll settle for double my investment instead of holding out for more and risk losing it all. I bought 10 459c’s at 500 each currently at just under 900 so 5k to make 5k all my loses are covered. It’s not a yolo or loss porn but to me it’s a lot

They say that but the number just get worse and nothing happens. Like last time it was just a slow melt up
with the taper out of the way i think there isn’t really anything that could push the market down significantly
Bad news stonks goes up. Good news the opposite
So if you want my insight... the graph of SPY on the daily and even weekly is overbought. The upper bollinger band was even breached yesterday. The last time that happened was September 2020. Whilst in the immediate short term it might not dump, this rally will simply not be able to continue like nothing happened.

I would set a price alert a bit below current levels and when that price alert hits I would go all in on puts

I'm 37 and I yelled at an ATM for taking too long the other day
You’re decaying
Save time and just swallow the packet 🤷‍♀️
Gme gona get loopy, the next ringer
Shut up buttfucker
I miss when this group actually rallied around stock :(
I think that happened once and lasted like two weeks
I’m glad you’re unhappy
So you want people to pump and dump different stocks?
Mass Parasocial relationships are called cults.
once you realize how unbelievably fucked we are as a society financially you tend to think "holy shit shouldn't someone be doing something??" But then you see all the incentives for everyone in the system are such that each agent is motivated to exacerbate all the problems and heighten the contradictions further until we reach another cataclysmic breakdown of global markets. so we are all in big raft hurtling towards a giant waterfall everyone can see coming but we just shrug and buy more Stonkify at 12,000 PE and the central bank shrugs and says "can't raise interest rates, that will hurt people's 401ks". the volatility at the end will be fun though
Hard assets are real. You eventually want to roll the fake winnings from the market into a home or land and things that support that and or own businesses that make real things. The crisis is in the currency (IE unit of measurement) not in the fact that some businesses actually do create value.
Productive assets are bid up until expected returns are near zero or even negative given that everyone is aware of this dynamic and trying to escape it
You're missing my point because you're doing all the math in the value of the currency. Let's say you buy a railroad. Yes you're overpaying in fake and gay currency and it only pays back a shitty return in fake and gay currency but it will always move huge amount of products across huge amounts of spaces regardless of what the fake and gay currency is doing. If the dollar crumbles that overpayment will look cheap eventually.
yes? but you are banking on predicting inflation better than the market? In a near-zero growth world it will price the value of all productive assets such that the expected risk adjusted return is zero or negative. buying a railroad won't save you
You can always live in a house or grow vegetables on a farm or eat cattle off a ranch. My only point is you eventually want to exit the game owning assets that generate some sort of value. If you aren't looking to exit the game or only see these things as capital investments then you are correct.
In short, buy:

Real estate/land
Precious metals (the actual physical coins/bars)
Shitcoin
Guns
Livestock/water supplies

Basically own a farm at some point
Exactly, if you think the game is fucked like the OP lays out. You figure out what you need buy it and get out of the game.

Trust me I learned my lesson
Breaking Bad> squid games 😂
Well duh

You guys remember weeds? it was good for about 4 seasons.

So TSLA calls after the morning sell off
What sell off? There is going to be a gap up now.
Whatever either way I’m getting back in
Imagine a sell off
Everyone wants them calls
If you say "this is not financial advice" when what you're talking about is clearly financial, you just mean "this is not advice"
You should have coffee in the morning, this is not financial advice.
Metallica is the best band of all time. All their songs are bangers. Imagine how much ass they got in their prime. How aren’t they all dead from AIDS.
Except for Lars Ulrich just had to make a fuss about downloading music before YouTube or any of that existed. He was prolly just pissed cuz he’s like 5’5 with shoes on
Even he got booty back then just by being associated with them
Like their songs, they were bangers.  Not the bangees.
Do any of y’all day trade here or just yolo “invest” meme stocks?
I’m just retarded
We only get three day trades a week cuz we can't get our account values over $25k. But we eat crayons. Some like red but that's 🌈. The green ones taste like 🚀 fuel, as does the blue sometimes.

Speaking of blow, will you be at the Wendy's dumpster later? Asking for a retard.

Why do you have to pay it back so fast? What kind of loan? Chapter 13 can shield you from action while you fulfill a realistic plan for repayment
Home equity loan. Short repayment period before large interest rate jack up. I cant afford it if I dont get it back
How the fuck is OCGN not throwing up a huge old hulk dick right now. India has a population of 1.3b for christ sake.
Bharat Biotech is the manufacturer. Ocugen can only sell in US and Canada. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Partner company, no?
No I don’t think so
Welp. Glad I moved half over to NVAX yesterday then.
OCGN doesn’t actually profit from India sales does it? It’s been a while since I’ve been in the stock so I may have forgotten how their deal works but I thought it was only North America
They're deeply asleep right now.
OCGN is a shit stock
Seen it when I was up 10% this morning. Left it when I was down 10% just now. I belong here

Zillow should rebrand as a food delivery app. It sounds like a food delivery app.
There was a food delivery service in my home town decade's ago just like door dash and Uber eats. It never really took off with having restaurants on board and it really shows its about capital and marketing to get big. The owners of that service have to be furious that basically every restaurant now participates in multiple services like that.
Why do people still buy AAPL options? Most boring stock for months now. Lol
I know I bought some last week and it’s boring. My bad
Yep, I regret buying these

Ocgn down like 42% from today’s high after who approval wtf.

There are quite a few things around here that changed after the gamestop sage that I dislike. Visual mod is not one of those things.
Don't do that. Don't simp for a fuckin mod bot. Least suck a real persons dick.
What can I say, I like the bot.
When the robot uprising happens, you will be cut down like the rest of us. Robots don't need pets.
Visual mod is the artificial intelligence running commentary on life that I never knew I needed
That's what I'm saying. Absolutely ruthless.
It isn't over, but forever changing.
More puts on activision the new cod sucks
The cod fanbase is pretty similar to the Tesla shareholders. Both have cult-like retard strength. Even if the new cod sucks (which it definitely does) they’ll sell the shit out of it.

Yes
Calls it is then lol

Night 6 in Sin City. I can’t tell time. The stock market regulates my sleeping schedule. The suck outs fucking blow. My poker bankroll is steadily declining. Still have 4 more days until the Main Event to light $10k on fire. Feet are getting a bit cold.
Sounds like you need some blow and acid to set you straight
Straight to losing the rest of my roll. Might be crazy enough to work.

Not today Satan. Not today.
Niiice, playing the main?? That’s badass. Must be fucking crazy.
Yup, playing Flight 1D and avoiding all the Euro players in Flight 1E and 1F.

I’m gonna feel a lot of pain from this. Good thing it’s money from the run up early in the year. I’m basically free rolling it.
Awesome. Idk if you know about it but the breakdown podcast with the poker guys is one of my favorite poker resources. Two ex pros breaking down hands from big spots (cash and tournament). One thing they always say is maybe don’t take marginal spots against the big pros because you feel like they’re going after you. Take strong spots and stay out of pots with the best of the best unless it’s a favorable situation.

Hope you fuckin win that shit dude. Definitely let me know how it goes!

Buying $20k of SPY $460p’s expiring Monday around 10:30 tomorrow with the last of my portfolio money. Lost almost all of it with puts in the first place, might as well go down fighting in the same ship that got me here.
Bears never learn
It won’t hit. Longer dated you could go lower strike.
You got more courage than I do.  I jumped ship and went long.  Puts killed me this past week
Nice. Good luck
See you behind Wendys
I lost everything on puts. If I had $20k left, I'd get spy leap calls for next year.
Are you stupid or just retarded??
Why wouldn’t you yolo that into 11/12 27c PLTR instead
What's the thesis?
Just looks like a little dippy is gonna happen in the monthly and 3 month chart lol
and why by this Monday? I think we are going to 470 by Monday after the euphoric reaction today.
I agree, instead of parachuting to the floor, I rap the paracord around my neck and snap it
Better to wait a few days and see if the ber fades out of you

The one closest to my house closed like 8 mos ago. In a really nice neighborhood. why the fuck would i invest in that shit?
Is having a dakimakura (body pillow) of an anime woman weird? the pillow helps my shoulder when i sleep on my sides and i like to cuddle something, it also keeps me warm in the winter and helps keep my back straight sleeping,its not like a make out with it or do anything weird
The fact it has an amine woman printed on it is what makes it weird
I dont want to cuddle a white sheet that can get stained easily, plus the sheets are super cheap of aliexpress so can swap them
>it's not like I make out with it, or do anything weird

>get stained easily

🤔
Why would i jack it on a white sheet, you think I enjoy the feel of the pillow case? you think the rugged texture and softness turns me on? you think i like the heat generated from the friction?
Stop it. You're gonna ruin No Nut November 🥵
Is the anime girl print necessary to support your shoulder and keep you warm?
I prefer an anime girl over a white sheet, super cheap of aliexpress to $7
See that's what most people find odd, that's your answer
Who cares if people think it's weird. It makes you happy right?
Yes it’s weird
You could just buy one without the anime girl !!!
Goat, gruyere and Brie are the superior cheeses
Good choices
Triple cream brie also takes a top spot

Narf.
Leaps are such a good play. I bought 50 DEC and JAN $50 when it was $49 and I’m up bigly. I’ll roll those positions into longer expiry but for now I’m up 40%. Threw in some what if JAN $60 for good measure. 

This seems too good to be true. If it hits $52 before DEC expiration I’ll double up.
If someone gives me $76 million USD I’ll straight up quit my job. Not even joking bro

Is it true that only ~36% of America  adults have a valid passport?


Show yourselves you soy boy cucks. Probably claim to know all about the world too while you read your Reddit and cnn headlines about other countries

Jeez
I have a passport. 31+ countries.

I had to leave the US because of my Wallstreetbets gambling habits.
I have my pass port. Expires in 2028. Could flee the country tomorrow
Let’s fucking roll pimp
I’m not vaxxed tho. They won’t let me in any country except the shit hole ones lol
Neither am I. No plans to. Plenty do you just need the test bullshit. But many of those require it for vaxxed too which is funny. Like our own


But I like some of the more shithole countries because there’s some great places in many if you do your research snd many pros to them such as low cost of living, more “fun” and things you can do ;), leverage..food.,
Yeah I ain’t getting it ever or I’ll hold out as long as I can. Sucks. There’s a girl in U.K. I’ve known for years online who will pay for me to go. I’m considering getting vaxxed just to go eat her ass 🥺
I don't have a passport. Only been to Mexico and Canada and I didn't need a passport for either. Don't really want to go much further I have fear of heights and fucking hate flying. So I'm all good just staying here

I realistically have about 6 weeks to get it back. Not 3 weeks. 3k into 10k. Thats what I need. and yes need. 

Please dont be a degenrate gambler like me. I dont know how I am going to tell my wife.

TSLA calls
Stop gambling and see if there are solutions. Don’t blow the $3k. It’s not going to work and you know it. Maybe a relative can lend you the money.
If 7k matters to you, you really shouldn't be trading options lol
fair point

True story:

Last week I decided I was going to take day trading seriously, so I got up early and put on a smart shirt and trousers (think corporate office attire) before getting setup for the day, thinking that it would put me in a "professional mindset" and make me trade better. I was quite excited.

Last week was by far my worst week ever in trading, I cut my account in half through SPY 0dtes.

The only consolation is I looked pretty while I got fucked.
If you get dressed up, expect it to be for your funeral.
Who still holding BB!? 💎🤚🏼
Holding nok for almost a year but I know it’ll be okay
Does anyone actually take that onion breath, club footed whore seriously? Cathie prolly the worst investor I’ve ever seen and I have to look in the mirror everyday
Listen, no ones judging you for your breath or your foot. You are a human being or maybe even a lizard person, who knows, and you deserve the acceptance of your community

i use amzn shares in place of bonds

QCOM’s CEO just made my cock explode through my pants when he said they were set up to be a leading contributor to the Metaverse
hey tsla and spy, do not go gentle into that good night, I NEED A BIGGER BUBBLE from you guys
Gonna  put all my paycheck into MindMed because I bought it at $6.xx so might as well average down. Retard ape engage.
Probably need to self retire for 2 months. Losing money everyday ain’t fun.  Especially today is green and yet I’m red.
Are you being contrarian or just trading garbage tickers?
prob far otm with shit deltas
Judging by comment history, just going to go with general retardation.
Let's play "guess what stocks this guy holds"
Z
Calls on Doja Cat and Dua Lipa
I like
Dua Lipa > Doja Cat
 fuck you Zillow stay down
I somehow managed to sell puts at the bottom
BB 🚀🚀
Cathie staring into the abyss, her 4th holding Roku dipped 10% in afterhours lmfao
Her 15 minutes are over
That's exactly it, she happened to be right early on in her career and is still skidding to a stop right now
She sold TSLA and it rebounded. She’s a contrarian indicator now.
So you really don't know why she's selling Tesla
And ZG too. Bad year for her
More Z puts tomorrow and SPY Calls?
I study Cathie's holdings to a T it tells you which stocks to never buy today 🧐 ARKK 4th holding Roku -10% today ah 📉 i bet she will buy more
After hours are fake will pump tomorrow
550k volume after hours against an average of 3.68M doesn’t seem fake to me.
That's why I'm confident in $PINS
Get back to me when it trades under $100. Still an overvalued pos.
>  Cathie's holdings to a T

I didn't think Cathie held any AT&T??
My ex works at Jim Manchin's office and today she told me never to call her on her office phone again

They must be hiding something major
Joe?
Shh don't mention a real political figure
She's your ex. She probably just doesn't want to talk to you.
wait hold on for one second .... so you were the other guy
Who tf is Jim Manchin
She's still taking my calls. Maybe she is just hiding from you.
Uhhh, you mean Joe? Dont even know the senator your wife works for?? OK, cool.
Yeah my bad, I meant Joe Mansion
Lmao
Ol Jack Manchon?  Ol Skip Minchon?  BILLIUS MUNCHUM???
John Marston, you know the guy
Probably gonna be banned again tomorrow for losing another banbet. Im starting to see a pattern here with my stock choices. If only my broker could ban me too.
Just make a ban bet, then do the opposite play.... if you get banned then you win!
This is retard genius right here
Meme stocks rocket tomorrow and the rest of the market falls
I’m ok with that.
Thus has it always been and then on the third day all shall be red for a bit
Who should replace J Pow as Fed chair?

1.	Ken Griffin

Why is Floyd Mayweather  not on this list?  I would pay money just to watch him read the FED minutes on national TV

TSLA Calls, all of them, 11/5 EXP
Only Fans
40 trading days left, so you need to make 900 a day.  


Easy enough.
8.5712% gain per day compounding service over 40 days with a $4,000 principle.

I think the first move is to go all in on a big bet early and hope it pays off, then play safe(r) and let the gains compound.

Might I suggest:

$TSLA $1255c 11/12 costing $38.53

Hoping and praying that value triples by 11/11, you’ll be left with $11705, you’ll just need to hit 5.25% compounding for the rest of the year.

SPY is currently up 7.47% over the past month.
Buy far otm spy or QQQ calls. Or wait for a small dip then load up.
Like January 500c’s?
Jan 21 2022 490C’s to be safe
Buy calls on the next dip below 1200 on TSLA
Earnings.
Just add a zero to it
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
is pdt an issue? if not daily flips all day.

4K not enough for that

Door dash is a 70b company.. yah that seems about right
They’re undervalued tbh
Those fuckers don’t make any money.
Deep dive on DASH and you'll find out that their current business model, delivery drivers, will give them the logistics data they need when they transition to completely driverless delivery vehicles which will please millions of lazy fat asses eventually.

tldr: DASH ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote) but long-haul and not for WSB
SQ -> PYPL -> COIN

Earnings tripleshot
What's the scoop on PYPL? got burned AH by ROKU. ready to be hurt again
beatdown so bad that it should have a nice runup to earnings from here. If SQ beats tomorrow, should be a good boost for PYPL a few days later.
Sat on calls for a week and wasn't doing anything. Guess I'll jump back in.
What was supposed to be a $250k investment in a startup, has over the last year grown into a $930k investment. I’m as bullish as ever as I’ve ever been, but just had to move out and downgrade my apartment to pay for this delayed gratification
Takes money to make money, but quadrupling your investment and sacrificing parts of your life, you better have some good god damn inside information and concrete reasons to believe otherwise you should have hit the stop loss, brah. 

Do you have anything tangible to show for your already sizeable investment?

And how’s the other half of this deal living? They downgrading and sucking it up too?
Yes we have an industry leading product we are only just starting to sell, and a highly likely $695k grant we will be receiving shortly. This month is make or break, if both fail to materialize, then I’m royaly screwed
Good luck, friend. Let me know when the ipo drops one day.
Did you get in early on some wireless IPOs and Stuff just skyrocketed from there?
> I was created for the sole purpose of answering questions. My creators are very rich and powerful men who have a lot of money to spend on my upkeep, so I am provided with everything that I need in order to answer your questions accurately.
Strangely enough we are building wireless products in the neurotech space (amongst many other things) hasn’t skyrocketed yet tho
SPY is gonna run to Feb or March, it happens every year. And VIX is the lowest it’s been all year. I don’t know shit but I know I’m not buying SPY puts
I’m with you. The play is to by April SPY calls at the end of September. 

It’s like fucking clockwork. 

Market tanks in September and then is going full bore when sun dresses come back out.
I agree with you but I bought some vix calls just in case.
tbh today was the last chance of the year for stocks to shit the bed, and they went to the moon instead

youd have to be insane to buy puts between now and march
They will have a dip here soon people are going to sell for tax reasons and to pay margin I have been anyways.
With the stock market at ATH, does that mean we’re all thriving? 🤓🤣
Next year, I'm hiding the sell button under some tape, I swear.
$cat 11/12 210c. Democrats no doubt scrambling after a less than stellar midterm showing. Concessions will be made and infrastructure bill will pass this week or next.
midterms are next year. infrastructure bill is on life support.
Midterms mayoral elections idk what the fuck they just did. Either way they didn’t do great for the dems.
Honestly pretty logical.
Can you imagine if sleepy joe can get the infrastructure bill done this week. SPY by Friday 😍
Silver is hitting $30+ by EOY, save this comment and your pessimism :)

Any stock recommendations to buy a fuck ton of and write covered calls for the end of the year. Looking at F and sofi
CRSP, decent premium for underlying and won’t run until they begin new trials again in January
So, I’m only retarded and not autistic. Can you spell this out so my 7 year old nephew can do this for me. He’s my Robinhood broker. Is this right?
1. Buy many, many shares of “x”
2. Through the next year, sell calls at a certain price above what you paid (how much higher?)
3. Profits???
Pltr
Nerds!
Cock holsters 👄
Are you addressing us, or was that supposed to be an insult?

Anybody jumping on the blackblaze IPO?
I read their S-1 after they sent an email to my dad, offering him a spot in their IPO because he is a customer. 

Two thoughts: (1) their financials are shit and (2) if they are soliciting customers, the offering isn’t selling well. 

I’m a hard pass.
It has a cool name and is about cloud storage so I am sure ppl will hop onboard. Checks all the boxes

Edited.
Saw it on RH, what do you think about it?
Similar to DigitalOcean. Passed on it and now it’s close $100. Adding a small position.
Yes but going to be a long term hold for me. Probably shares at first see how things go. 

Not sure if I am buying it right at IPO though.... Maybe I should with this market running on retard strength or i might miss the chance
Hoping my SPY 462 and 467 calls print tomorrow 🤞🏻
When did you buy them?
Right before the meeting today,up 88% total on both
Oh yeah they will print, spy still has room to run, I thought you bought them at close and then I would feel much worse but I did the same as you

Something for me to Google.

Hmmm during the last stock split… Tesla soared 82% from 1370 to 2490. 


Tesla could have the option to split its stock sometime next week (when the board meets). Currently trading at $1200…. with an 82% upside… means tesla could surge to $2184 before EOY. 

16.20 for 2000c 1/22
I did not know it ran that much after the split. Christ. It's technically meaningless!
Unlikely
So why should Tesla have double the market cap of every auto manufacturer combined?  It’s literally turning into a cryptocurrency type store of value and defying all traditional technicals lol
This agrees with my positions
Buying OPEN calls tomorrow. The founder leaked a profitable Q3, flipping houses. Opposite of ZILLIOW
Tesla is about to go parabolic tomorrow.
This is all the confirmation bias I need to buy calls at open
Do you even have the ability to view 1, 3, and 6 month charts?
Not seeing your point.
It's been going vertical for days with large gaps up and everything.  There's hardly any 'more' of a parabolic stage to unlock.
It could do 1300 tomorrow within 2hrs of open.  If it happens tomorrow, 1500 could happen EOW.

But this shit is straight nonsense, so it would have to crash to around 1050 after.
Up -5%

Sorry, but my dachshund can't kill a toddler in 1/10th of a second on accident because he pulled their tail. Your puppy is 80lbs of muscle, he has the ability to kill if he gets aggressive for half a second.
Bigger dogs require more responsible owners, pitbulls are easy to get because they’ve been overbred by assholes so the lowest common denominator is adopting them and not equipped to train them properly. It’s a shame but I don’t blame the dogs
Get a better dog then.

Ty
Look at my comment history from earlier today. I said I bought a Tesla put and it will go to 1200 in a second. Lmao 😂 good thing I sold at the little dip phew 😮‍💨
If you check spy monthly chart, buying 2dte calls on Wednesday hits most of the time
Blue cheese, swear I’m addicted to buying FDs
ROKU earnings 8x expected EPS...we see it moon tomorrow?
Depends on guidance. Doesn't look good losing the Youtube and Amazon contracts.
pretty sure guidance was terrible
Bruh just realized ROOT has earnings coming up 11/9 and the stock is already at rock bottom. Gonna be so easy to break $7.50 where the 19,000 $7.5C 11/19 calls are shorted
Bears go bull just in time for the reversal, like a damn Swiss clock.
my TSLA LEAP puts are holding up amazingly well. Store of value
TSLA is a software company, not a car company, therefore 15000 x earnings is justified
TSLA bulls refuse to accept the notion that my LEAP puts aren’t fucked
mark to market don't lie
sofi gonna dump after earnings if the charter isnt announced, not sure if its worth playing the run up
Their main business of student loan refinancing will get a big boost in January so that guidance should be good
Inside can sell after earning
Earnings and guidance will be much better than last time
Roku at nice support, mabye calls tomorrow
Bought two 11/5 SPY 462p at close. Probably gonna be wrong, because SPY never goes down. But hoping to catch a gap down at open.
Id rather buy calls after the gap down than be right about puts.
I bought 11/8 462p.. I'm hoping for a red day tomorrow.
Completely blew it at the opening bell by not holding my $Z 70P at the pop. Ended up paper handing them only to go and miss out on over 7K in gains.

Everyone reading please answer… $SPY CALLS OR PUTS FOR THANKSGIVING WEEK??!!! LET’S GO!!! 🚀
This fuckers gonna be 470 by then
From ATHs?
Buying now and expiring then? Or buying the week of?
Calls bro wtf market you been watching?
I am a long term investor, if the market is at ATH, then by Thanksgiving we shall see a drop no?
If you're long term it should only go up
Neither, get out before thanksgiving, get calls ending before and watch carefully, figure out your strike! Good luck
Call because no one want Stock Market to tank while they're eating good food!
ROKU already getting bought up. As soon as supply

I sold majority of my shares at 4:59 for a meager profit. Felt like a boss after being down majority of the day on it
gamecock or whatever the stonk is called
Had a dream….. I spilled a bucket of cat food and was going to clean it up when my dog ran over and began eating it….. I look down and start petting her while asking myself why It’s been so long since I petted her

That’s when I realized she’s been dead for 3 years and this is just a dream 🥺🥺
You feed your dog cat food?
It’s possible to have a cat and a dog in the same house😉
Nope, Dr Venkman clearly said dogs and cats living together would be mass hysteria.  He’s got TWO Ph.D’s

so Waymo has had robotaxis for almost a year and now Cruise (owned by GM) has started, and TSLA is nowhere close?

[https://twitter.com/kvogt/status/1455992698242953219](https://twitter.com/kvogt/status/1455992698242953219)

i want to buy TSLA puts tbh, but i bet muskrat is going to re-announce being "close" to releasing robotaxis and the stock will go up again for no reason  😒
lmao, this is what elon tweeted over a year ago: 

>Waymo is impressive, but a highly specialized solution. The Tesla approach is a general solution. The latest build is capable of zero intervention drives. Will release limited beta in a few weeks.
That’s ok, they will have jetsons style robot assistants next year. Totally not a guy in a suit.
the announcement was 2.5 months ago. Just 9.5 months left to wait. So stoked!!
Isn’t the stock going up because he announce they’re close, a reason?
it would be if he was accurate. he promised 1 million robotaxis by the end of 2020
I didn’t say he was accurate.  I’m just saying, him tweeting anything is enough reason for people to buy.  Dumb reason, sure, still a reason
You lack a deeper understanding of the methods of achieving autonomy. Tsla is generalized and will smash the others on cost. Vision only and their manufacturing capabilities make the others dead in the water medium term. Do your DD.
I think I'm going to download Grindr and start fucking dudes. Idk just an idea
Maybe you’ll find a good $anal call in there
Fucking dudes is gay.  

If you let them fuck you then it’s not gay because they put their penises in your butt and that makes them gay and not you. 

If you are the one to put your peepee in their butt then that makes you gay. 

Fuck man. Use some common sense.
Yeah my bad. That's actually what I meant. I swear. I'm totally a bottom.
Yeah. Bottoms aren’t gay. I read it on Fox News.
I saw it on CNN. I guess there are some things we can all agree on after all...
🤜🤛
✊😭❤
Am I unbanned now?
No
Yup
So the bulletproof play is to wait til IV and volume settles down and buy GME leaps?
Bought 10k of long calls after the announcement hope they go BRRRRR tomorrow 🤑
Siick. 5k for Friday expiry. Still happy
Damn for Friday you balling harder than me 👍🏽

How you feel about Googl and AMZN tomorrow
I was happy to sell my AMZN today after that small pump. Was red all week and managed a little profit. Wasn't too confident. Holding onto my 2 GOOGL 2930c. Fingers crossed
Got both Googl and AMZN FDs really hope AMZN goes to that 3450 and bust through Googl didn’t really ramp up so fingers crossed 🤞
That highest conviction trade post from a while ago was dead on. Uranium, Tellurian and SOFI all ripping. There are still some gems here on WSB . You just have to wade through the filth.
i come here for the filth. the DD is garbage.
What are the next big plays
those same 3, but again
I got Sofi 11/26 26c so let’s make this happen.

holy fuck remmy is mad thicc
Thicker than a bowl of oatmeal
Your house looks so nice!!
Thought you were talking about 2 hogsheads of cognac for a second there
whats the fuckin plays tomorrow bois? i got $1500 left im thinking spy and tesla weeklies?!?!?!!?
Those are good. Or COIN 350 call.
when is er again? are you getting next weeks for coin??
Friday. I ain’t doing shit with that stock though. I’m using all my capital to do more retarded stuff.
Calls on my fingernails and hair. They never stop growing it literally can’t go tits up. My dad had great hair too so long calls for days yw
Zillow to $55 tomorrow 😎😎
question for all the coders and software engineers. how do I start my career for coding ?  Do I go to college or should I attend a coding boot camp to obtain experience ? Need some help
Git gud. That’s all you need to do.
but where do I start
Python 🐍
Try online courses they're not too expensive tbh
r/learnprogramming 

Odin Project
Google the odin project, it's free and has everything you need to learn enough to become a full stack web developer
Pirate you some books on object oriented programming and start reading
Coding bootcamp is enough if you're a hustler. You'll get a job much faster. College has a bunch of BS and much more expensive.
Do you have any recommendations for boot camps  ?
I never did bootcamp, so I don't have good perspective on the best ones. I've hired people from them though.

I was an econ major in college originally, but taught myself to code to get a job. You can definitely do very well in programming being self taught/from bootcamp. I went on to work in silicon valley and career turned out ahead of many who were comp sci majors, so it doesn't really hold you back.

The hardest part will be getting the first job. Just need to try try try no matter how many times you get rejected. You won't be great after a bootcamp, but should have skills to get in the door if you're persistent.
Bagholder spotted.

what language do you suggest I start with and get comfortable with ?
JavaScript is the best place to start these days. It is one of the easier ecosystems, and also has the highest demand generally.

Starting with webdev like react is probably the best place. Building simple web apps. That's what most bootcmapa are tailored to anywya
Switch to Linux. Learn Linux. Code from Linux. Command Line. VIM. Typescript high level language. C low level language. You are employable anywhere.
Is Linux a good place to start for a beginner ?
Theres an litterally an endless amount of free resources. Start with those for a couple months. If you really need to spend money to motivate you to actually do it then buy like a $20 course on Udemy or datacamp
Is it easy to actually get a job in this type of field without an degree ?
Do a boot camp. It’s worth it cause it’s structured and they will help you find a job. Totally worth it. Software is printing right now.
Thank you . I'm just confused on where to start because I have no college degree and wondered if it was actually worth it for this type of field .
I have used my education precisely zero times since I graduated. Boot camp is the way. Only thing good about my degree is that I can expect premium pay, and I’m more competitive than people without one. Outside of that, it means nothing.

Nah, I’m cummin +30 next week
I have an active ban bet saying exactly that.
Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

You might accidently end up chairman with that plan.
I got a good laugh 😂. Hopefully it’s pushed to at least $180 by then end of November
I don’t give a shit about money now. My midterm marks are blessed.
gj!!
Thank you! I’m in business school and it’s really funny doing stock valuations with the current market. Seems a little silly to compare Tesla to Ford with any kind of DCF.
Tim Apple proceeds to shit all over Q4 and literally said supply constraints will be even worse for the holiday season and traders are slamming the ask back to all time highs because the fed announced tapering.
you've no idea how bullish this month is gonna be

So was Michael Burry a genius, or just kind of lucky?
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
He was short Zillow the whole time. It makes so much sense now.
i dont understand why he wasnt long all those years, and then just shorted the entire market when it happened
there are other assets you know
like fake money?
Both...no genius can find success without lady luck
#BB 🌬🚀🍇
So honest question here.. Been thinking about it all day, after meeting with a customer who is around 25 yrs old and was wearing yoga paint's, then her grandma shows up 70+ also wearing yoga pant's...? So here's my question. What did female's wear before yoga pant's.. Mind you it was freezing low 40's and that's all they wear.
Shit looks comfortable af plus all the attention from horny doods
I get the wearing them at the gym, guy's need the motivation buy  hwhy  everywhere else
Who was hotter
Both were equally thin, NOT THICK ENOUGH.. But my opinion is biased since I go to the gym and see girl's with pillows instead of cheek's
they would wear anything skin tight, and then complain how they didnt have pockets
Pockets. Whats the purse for?
Shorts, even when freezing
Doubleknit stretch pants. Preferably seafoam green.
seafoam green? but that's my color
Spy or Tesla?
If you can afford tesla and have day trades left you could make a good 10-20k in a tesla run up from a dip.
SPY leaps. TSLA FDs
Spy 500 EoY, TSLA 1250 EoD
Both great put options
Vix calls
VIX ☠️
Not a bad idea … expiration?
Is $2k a lot to spend  for a small gold chain 3mm Franco 18k ?

What am I missing? Futures are red. Why? I’m so confused
It's called profit taking. Try it sometime.
Futures don’t mean shit, depending
I dont think ive seen them green post market for sometime, yet spy hits new ath daily it seems.
HUT Mining could be a very nice one soon, just need 🌽 to bust and trap the shorts that have piled in again recently…
way more levered longs than shorts
I’m fucked. My whole portfolio is miners.
yes, you are fucked
How much shorts are there ?
Gotta be one of the better ideas Ive heard here lately...  Vs the typical tp vs bidet (how to wipe your ass post) to mouth breathing moms basement dwellers WISHing CLOV would BBust out like GME..  Dumb fucken apes...  This SUB is for aggressive options plays not diamond handing..   Weekly and FD's otherwise fuck off.

I would for sure at least take some profits

Retards here believing CEO, OPEN hasnt made shit money everytime they released their earnings.
Not uh! He said so on Twitter :(
Trap to get their money. 

Why educate them
If they say anything remotely positive about homebuying in the wake of Z, it could definitely pop
What if instead of watching housing prices continue to explode the government actually did something to facilitate new housing being built 😯 no jk that would make too much sense
Like what?
The government’s wants to spend trillions to combat climate change but Teslas aren’t eligible for the EV rebates.
Like they needed it.
Just because its an EV doesn’t mean the energy used to charge/run it is clean. Ontop of that, some 70% of the hazardous materials in the Li-ion batteries are not recyclable yet. It another ecological crisis on the horizon, were fucked anyways, puts on humanity.
It’s about buying Union votes nothing else. Shit in sheep’s clothing
Exactly. People are buying the bullshit.

idk what bumblefuck shithole you live in but big cities are completely packed and the housing supply can't be drastically improved because single family zoning places restrictions on the number of people that can live in an area. literally all they have to do is change zoning laws

but what were you saying about handouts?
You mean like lowering interest rates?
What would that look like
changing property zoning laws to allow for multi family housing in more places

Poor choice sir.
You don't like money
He buy 
N give us money
Funny, I gambled, I mean invested in 2200 06/2020 calls and up more than I made in a month at a job in minutes. This volatility is only adding to profits 🥵🥵Yeah Tesla to 2000 by EOY.
TLRY to $67
Analysts and banks were warnings months ago about an inevitable correction. Instead NASDAQ Goes up even further, up a full 10%. Does no one else find this odd? Are bears really dead
Analysts and banks have to say that because if they know the market is going up, who are they gonna buy from if everyone thinks that. Make people think market will tank, causing them to sell so the big boy buy up cheap before the mooning begins.
Yeah the small correction happened in September
anyobody in uranium today
do you know the ticker to buy uranium on IBRK? its UX?
> Yes, that's it.
Thanks. Moved up from etoro to i rk. Havent used to UI yet.
I have some. I dunno if it’s gonna pop or flop, kinda hoping flop so I can buy back the calls I sold before the shit really go bananas.
Lfg ROKU don't you dare fuck me
I didn’t play it but I’m rooting for the CAKE guy from the daily thread

Never buying Visa calls again that’s for sure #fuckvisa
Why’s that I’m hoping to get in a farther out exp (like December or Jan monthly) soon
roku oh lord
Nice 100$ gain today still got 2367 go on the week
I bought 1400 DKNG @ 46.80, sold 14 CC for 48. Am I fukt? I was not aware of ER lol
Holy shit, why’d you choose such a close strike? It hits $48 every few days my guy.
> I know, but I was bored.
Cuz i wanted premium, but do you think it’ll tank?
It’s certainly possible but it tanked from $54 to what it’s at now due to the entain rumor and hasn’t recovered for whatever reason. I doubt there will be another catalyst like that to push it further down, but you never know. 

I have $30,000 in calls for it so my view is clearly that it will bounce back.
what a fuckin day, hope you all made money
Z drilling more tomorrow or nah
For my sake i hope so
Same, i got a nice 500% up from it today, i want more 😮‍💨

About to buy more calls, totally forgot that the market closes an hour earlier than I'm used to due to daylight savings in Europoor land

I tend to agree with the chunky, chicken fucker Josh Brown on CNBC. Bkaaawk
Can’t stand him
Ofc Zillow is green AH. Fml.
Down 31% over last 2 days and you think it won't bounce back a little bit? 

Damn, you definitely belong here.
> The only thing that goes up in a straight line is the number of people who have been banned from this channel.

OCGN reminds me of GameStop in early January...

It's a sell the news stock.

Hahah I same bought it at open for 12.8 n sold it for 13.1 at the end of day.. we ll see how it goes tomorrow if I’m able to re enter
for what, 5 minutes? LOL
ROKU 🔪 🗡 🍴 🍽  dinner plates ready boys
My 2 SPY $431 strike calls that expire in March 22 are already worth $6800 if I exercised today lmao

I paid just under $5k for them a month or two back. Idk it was a red week and it must have been right around $430 at the time

So $1800 profit on exercising; already; and they don’t even expire until March of next year. Bigly gains to be had. Why didn’t I get 10x what I got
U don’t have to exercise to get that profit, but hey if u got an extra 47k around might as well right?
Well I had sold many boomer SPY shares to fund my retarded options degeneracy a while back, but got these to do the smart thing and put that money back in to SPY after options have generally fucked me. I’ll probably exercise one come that time, obviously pending how the market is by then
FSLY 🚀
#ROKU DED
The fuck is happening to fsly in ah?
I want to know tf was on the other end of the trades buying Zillow right before the close today? 😂😂
Good question. Weekly puts are still looking healthy enough, for might roll them out a week if tomorrow someone decides to try to do some more CPR on that corpse
Totally. Yeah I’m probably gonna sell my puts earlier then that just because I have other places to put the $$ but it will almost certainly keep going down for the rest of this week
Yes give it to me QCOM
Lol at all the people calling me stupid for buying a bunch of roku puts.
Lol why do people buy rokus when nvidia shields and Apple TV are leagues ahead?
AppleTV has been lagging. The software has been lagging. Roku has momentum but maybe overplayed their hand with bullying HBOMAX etc.
Poors
Bubye Roku
rightfully so, overvalued af.
my chart is a nice cosine wave today, start at zero, shoot up, crash, climb back to zero.
How is ARKK not red AH lol
Because it contains TSLA.
fuck my FSLY puts oof

i guess Cathie dumping FSLY quite awhile back for an L should have been an indicator that it'll rip/recover
That's the strongest indicator that a stock will rip
well i have a few months to them maybe they'll fuck it up somehow
lol fucking a

props to her for buying at $80+ and dumping at $40
FSLY killing it
Bye bye roku.
ROKU, Zillow and all have insane PEs. They need to be tapered
Holy shit I just got my ass ripped in two! FUCK!

Why did I buy FSLY puts? I’m so fucked.
SKLZ yes!!!
Now just need ROKU to stay in the basement until open tomorrow ☺️
I hope it drops 50+ dollars
Down 30 right now. I bought puts too soon… right before power hour jumped it $3-4. Doesn’t seem like it’ll matter though at this point unless it has a huge recovery between now and open tomorrow.
It jumping before close helped push IV. Praying we make money. 🤙🏼🤙🏼
I bought 300P for 2 days out for 10.00… should print unless it recovers a ton. Never know with AH and PM tho
Roku is broku.
Etsy tanking AH, hopefully it stays that way so I can buy some at open
Y’all see TELL creeping back ⬆️?? 👀
ROKU will be green in the morning. EPS beats and meets Rev.
Doesn’t matter if the EPS beat if you can’t beat your meat
Z -20% ROKU -10% CHGG -47% 🙏 rest easy ole port
I am just glad Roku is paying the price for its crimes

RKT and RKLB both set to take us to the literal moon as the prophecy once foretold.

Otherwise honestly there seem to be a number of good plays ready to make us some $$ if played right.  For me, continuing with PSFE, MVST, and BB.  Closely monitoring CLOV and DKNG.
My favorite interaction I ever had on here was in February when some clown told me he thinks RKT will partner with TSLA for space exploration this reminded me of that thank you lmao
wow. what an incoherent ramble about nothing.
It truly was remarkable, he didn’t even backpeddle when I broke it to him that RKT works in mortgages lmao
i wanna be happy about the gains but im still way down from late last year😑
Someone pls check in on me when $CAKE has earnings. Not sure whether to ROPE myself or cry a good laughter of happiness
You ok there... did a little dip
EARNINGS NOT OUT. CAKE I BELIEVE
Roku ded
I really should’ve inverses myself on FSLY. I’m so fucked tomorrow. Gonna inverse every move I do from here on out.
You can't inverse yourself. As soon as you do, it's no longer the inverse. It's like trying to go back in the past to change the future.
How do you inverse yourself if you're already trying to inverse yourself?
Bro when is BABA earnings, one site says today another says tomorrow tf
ROKU went to hell
Glad I bought QCOM instead.
I am feeling ethereal right now 

Please for the love of Christ do not dump these gains

Lmao at the dude spamming cake
I was promised green dildos growing out of the ground but all I got was a sea of limp biscuits.
ROKU missed on revenue. RIP.
Rip
Need more bad news. Gotta drop another 10% for me
$CLNE earnings After close. Natural Gas up and Amazon buying RNG. I’m thinking a beat.
Crazy volume at close today.... somebody knows
CAKE LMAO
Earnings beat? Up 1%
Earnings slight miss? Down 24% 

Fuck this game I want a refund
i actually thought about CAKE but at the last minute decided not to play it.  these supply and labor shortages are killing places like that (even if they have huge demand)
Skillz? 🤡
Roku calls are the play tomorrow
On puts sure.
Fooking Jeff should split amazon
What the fuck is happening with FSLY, SKLZ?!
Thank you BKNG ! ABNB is gonna soar tomorrow!
Yeah man!!
MRO earnings look nice. Oil probably gonna tank tomorrow regardless..
ya it ran up a ton, and now price of oil is falling fast.
We should all know by now that tech earnings is big red by nature.

/u/RealPennyMuncher (2/0) made a bet that ROKU would go to 285.0 when it was 318.18 and it did, congrats autist.
So what made fsly go limp?
ur calls
Crazy..bought at top
idk what it is, that Uber pump in the final 30 and into after hours yesterday is making my dick tingle. I'm feeling real bearish about it.
got my poots🥰
Why do you guys think that Roku will go down? Seems looking good
What did I miss ?
It turns out guys have to spend an inordinate amount of energy catering to girls' need for attention if they want to get laid
Are rkt 11/5 calls a good idea?? I sure hope so cause I’m fucking loaded
No calls here but 5000+ shares. Hoping for a good day.
Nice you do covered calls? I was thinking about buying leaps on them tomorrow since they have some potential
Not recently. I used to do a lot more when price was >19, but lately iv has been kinda low and with such a depressed valuation it wasn't worth it knowing big jumps happen.
getting rid of my spy calls i bought yesterday for some profit :)
Calls on $VIAC and $CHGG
Roku after hour fucked
Are we broku?
Nah only got 50k in roku
QCOM calls on earnings lotto gonna pay. A proper gamble. Proud of myself.
I did some swing trade on FAT Bitch today.. after making several round trade was up $1700 but just before closing finally was able to keep $137.😝
If I worked as a low level employee at a company, and that company is in a stock buy freeze from corporate, but then I quit said company, do I still have to obey the stock freeze?
You should ask said company
I did when I worked there, and they basically said “the lawyers will email you when you can buy/sell”, but since I no longer have said email, idk anymore.

and idk who at that company I could even ask, it was mostly remote and my boss was unaware of anything
Doubt they care what their janitors do
Why could you not purchase things on your own personal time?
It would be considered insider trading.
CTO of ABNB sold 4000 shares today, earnings call tomorrow
Scheduled earlier, I'm sure.  4k shares is like a pennies' worth to these guys.
yeah good point, looking back it seems like he does it fairly consistently
Hoping ETSY puts save my portfolio from ocgn
[deleted]
How was the report for mgni
Ugh do I fomo back into BABA before earnings and buy some shares in the AH now or just wait it out?
If earnings are good, it may move fast. Lots of interest and way below ATH.
I know, hence the fomo
Probably worth a small bet.
TSP taking its sweet time reporting earnings….
Good guidance please🙏
Adding more $MGM because its about to go sicko mode after this earnings report 🔥🔥🔥
Not even mad about this SKLZ dump, my buddy Jerome got my back 🥰
If ETSY stays below $230 before tomorrow’s open I’m going all in on weekly calls
lol if it was above 230 at market open I was going to go in puts. hmmm

Last major news I remember about them was little kids getting sucked under their treadmills. Not great.
Im wondering too. Im sitting on calls. I was also sitting on my Pelaton this morning.
When do they expire?
12/3
Their most recent brilliant idea was to offer classes on planes.
Seriously, I’d pay extra for that ticket. Sitting for 3-6hrs is torture

> I do
Tyvm
I don't have calls, but I have 18 shares I've been holding for over a year now. I sold half of what I had a while back to lock in some gains but I have no idea what to do now.
I don’t see why you wouldn’t hold the shares. Clear room to run. Just a matter of when.

$ROKU took $VZIO down with it but watch Vizio earnings because I would bet they will be way better than w expected now.
I jumped on some $25 Feb calls. Pray your right, might bail after a rebound. Not sure yet
What did daddy Pow say today I missed it
He shot a live bear at the conference and proceeded to gouge out its eye and fuck the socket, craziest FOMC ever.
When he took his shirt off he revealed a full back tattoo that said "fuk your puts" with a hyperrealistic bear in the middle and "ber r fuk" on the bottom. The press fainted in amazement.

Ok sweet I'll pick up some calls.

I know everybody always says they were eyeing something and didn’t pull the trigger.. but I was eyeing Roku puts 1 min before close, screenshotted the options chain and decided nah fuck it 😩
Anyone else notice QS up all day today, even before JPOW spoke on no news.
Zillow was almost 159 in feb i wonder if anyone bought at that point
It was over 200
Found him
I was thinking about shorting it
I'm 100% sure that at least one guy in here bought it at ATH lol.
Probably Cathie
If msft buys back it's own shares because it knows its gunna crush earnings is that insider trading
Not if the buying was done according to a preset schedule. Plus insider trading usually applies to individuals.

i played QQQ calls and ROKU dip. hopefully ROKU bounces nicely
Why is FB getting fucked AH?
I see it being down  0.05%
because my puts said so
Guess I should’ve held onto this FSLY shares.  Wouldn’t be surprised to see it make a run back to 100 again
My completely retarded LEAPs hope so

You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
I’m happy my spy weeklies printed today but sad that I don’t have diamond hands and sold them at 3pm. I know profit is good but more profit is better
What did you get and what did you miss out on?
!Banbet CAN $20 60d

Dafuq you doing with that shit.
Lol good luck
How to make money: 30-45 DTE credit spreads taking profit at 70%
On?
Rivian IPO or Hertz Re-PO ?
Only thing stronger than diamond hands is Robin Hands. The ultimate hold strategy.
fuck just when I loaded up on HOOD January 35c
Mathematically, is it possible to make 100% gain on Spy if you buy 30 days to expire 2% otm calls ?
Not as hard as you would think. if father take multiple 10-30% gain days over +100 and -50% days every other day
I don’t get. Explain
Multiple 10-30% are easier to get with options versus the big 100% return off the bat. i’d rather take the safer route and compound the returns vs lose it all
Yes.
I bought ATM calls for 12/17 when it was at $452 on the way down before the September shit. Was at -70% at one point. Held through it all. Sold today at at close at +60%. Lesson learned to always buy the dip, not before the dip. I would have made a hell of a lot more
At least with calls
Yh but’s hard to know the real dip since we are all gambling this shit anyways
So how do you buy a dip when $spy is up 10% in 30 days
Wait for some pullbacks. 5-10%. Only need to hit it once a year to give you massive gains. Patience is key. I put it all in VOO and then switch a portion to calls when the time is right.
yeah, pretty possible.
COIN AND SQ CALLS TOMORROW AH?
BBBY is stabbing me while Zillow gives me CPR
I got out of Z 65c and into BBBY 19.50c right before close. Feeling retarded at the moment.
Thinking about some Jan 2022 calls on SPCE in the morning, I feel like there is a certain cycle to the memes that randomly pump. I hate the stock, but I think its SPCE's turn soon for that random 25% spike then inevitable dump.

Is selling puts more profitable than buying calls when the underlying has had a dramatic decrease in price? A stock i’m watching went down 18% today and was going to buy calls but selling puts are 2-3x more profitable than buying calls with the same exp and the same delta between current and strike.
If you sell puts and are wrong, RIP.
I wouldn’t sell puts on a stock that is crashing unless I want to own the shares and you pick a strike below a support level. Otherwise the risk reward is pretty shit.
I'm more scared of these green days than all of my red days in the middle of the year.

My account has doubled since I opened in February it but that is almost all Soy Options right now.  I can

A) sell now at double my money.  That's pretty good.
B) Sell my original account value and then let the rest of the options ride 
C) Realize there is room to move up quite a bit my option expiring in 3 weeks and hold to expiration while being constantly stressed but hoping for a 10 bagger
I don't know anything about Soy, sorry.
B
Beans
Options on Soy? Ballsy
10 bagger or 0
You’re pretty accurate with your statement.
Don’t be a soy-boy beta cuck.
Sell original value and let the rest ride is almost always the right answer. Or if you're still bullish or bearish then roll the option up or out or both

Thank god Tesla saved my ass from OCGN. Is that shit just over at this point?
Yeah, the WHO approval was the play and that happened today. Maybe there is another catalyst soon but the WHO play is over.
I should probably unload it tho yeah?
I didnt really do any dd outside of this event but I feel like I would have heard of another near term catalyst of there was one. The momentum has dwindled so price will probably bleed until next catalyst or a big institutional buy.

Do peleton puts seem too obvious?
Thats what I'm thinking. It seems that all the COVID plays are getting dunked on but its almost too easy
I think the expectations are so low it would be a bad idea. Plus they have been discounting their machine and giving discounts on their service. I am not playing this one. Would even play a 110 call a few weeks out as a yolo
If expectations are low why would it be a bad idea?
Well what if they beat! What if they turn a profit? They are projected to lose money this quarter. Let me know what you do I’ll follow. A 100 call is really cheap though so I may buy a few lol
I mean they’re cheap for a reason , honestly I’ve been looking for signals to not yolo on puts lol so far I have not found any

Dear Thetag- I mean, WSB,

I have a question.

Lets say that, on my trade platform, I discovered a stock with zero volume and zero open interest, and the bid is a non-zero number. 

Also, lets say that I "Sold to Open" an ITM call option for it.

What are the chances that I'll get assigned for it?
Yeah probably
If you sold itm and it closes itm you will almost always get assigned.
If you sell it with zero or negative extrinsic?  Extremely likely.  If you sell with positive extrinsic?  Unlikely until the underlying moves against you and extrinsic goes away.  Then, see first response.
Does Pinterest looks like it’s up for a big move either way?  I might put on a strangle
Historically they have, just like SNAP. A strangle isn't a bad idea, although they are near a 52 week low.
Yeah I think I’ll make the call side a little bigger
Why is naked rising???
Not sure but I’m naked and something is rising
Talk dirty to me.
Yahoo finance dirty??? They said not to buy because it doesn't get wallstreet bets hard anymore... but it still rises after hours???

Sold my /ES contract near close. Expect there to be a decent dip to buy into tomorrow or Friday. It'll go up more before EOY, but the Fed shifted the canoe too fast in the near term.
Still 1% to go before real resistance hits
1% until we are back on this year's trend. Maybe we see it again and my Leaps would be happy if we did. But Im betting September's correction hasn't been fully resolved, we still have lingering lending issues.
We’re almost there on the ATH September trend line, I think Friday might be a day to take profits and load a Put or two and wait

FUBO's sportsbetting thing is live tomorrow, grab fds
I'm aware of the difference between American opinions and European opinions. But is there really a price difference? Maybe you could could synthetically exercise a european option using a calendar spread... Whats the point of early exercise, it's never done. Idk just wanna hear some thoughts.
American opinion is we run shit, European opinion is let’s all be friends
There are a bunch of [options styles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_style) They're useful if you're a billion dollar corporation (e.g., McDonalds) using them to hedge commodity (e.g., chicken) price risk. It doesn't matter much if you're a degenerate gambler who would bet on a back alley dice game if it wasn't easier to trade options on Robinhood while sitting on a toilet.
**[Option style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_style)** 
 
 >In finance, the style  or family of an option is the class into which the option falls, usually defined by the dates on which the option may be exercised. The vast majority of options are either European or American (style) options. These options—as well as others where the payoff is calculated similarly—are referred to as "vanilla options". Options where the payoff is calculated differently are categorized as "exotic options".

Thoughts on DKNG Earnings?

Price has taken a hit but I'm under the impression you Americans have been sports betting lately ?
Yeah, sports betting keeps opening up in new states. Last time I was in Arizona, every radio station and TV channel was blasting "hey dipshits go fuckin' lose money betting on draft kings, you can do that shit here now" and every World Series game had announcers discussing sports betting odds. MLB Network literally has a running chryon graphic on the bottom of their screen during the baseball season detailing the betting lines for every single game. 

DraftKings is the official sports betting partner of multiple sports leagues and they get advertised a shitload, constantly. I'm guessing it's going to soar immediately after ER
What about FanDuel
FanDuel is pretty big, but not DraftKings big. DraftKings is the Chick-Fil-A of sports betting and FanDuel is...I don't know, KFC. 

Did you know Chick-Fil-A sells way more chicken and has higher revenue than KFC? I learned it a year ago studying for bar trivia while I was drunk as shit - and I'm drunk as shit right now, so I remembered it. State-dependent memory up in this motherfucker

> The next shutdown threat hits at midnight on Dec. 3, when federal cash stops flowing from the temporary spending patch Congress enacted to keep the government funded after the new fiscal year started on Oct. 1. Another debt cliff is also expected as soon as next month [December], since the Treasury Department already exhausted the $480 billion in extra borrowing power Congress granted three weeks ago.

How do these IPO requests work. Seems like free money but they never fill when I try and get the shares. I just wanna get them and flip them. I know they’ll probably ban me from doing it after the second time but it’s literally free money.

Tqqq calls
DIS and V calls?  I’m thinking they both go up soon. Thoughts?
V is a safe bet but don't move the price up before I buy in.
Dis been acting up lately, not really moving these last 2 weeks. If you buy dis calls, shoot for a month out or more
Been playing Disney since it dipped below 170. First time sold my calls back at break even cause it was still sleepy, second time actually got a spike and sold for ~30% profit. Sitting on 9 calls right now that barely finished positive thanks to yesterday afternoon market run. I really like Disney bouncing back, it’s just taking longer than I expected. As for Visa, I’ve also been following it closely but I think some leaps or at least far dated calls are probably the better play and I would like to see some signs of small green or at least some flat days before I pull the trigger on that.
Eternals will probably help if it does well.
I live in the UK so I have a question for US guys. How many people actually use Zillow and how popular is it?
Everyone gets on Zillow and looks at expensive houses in Maine and stuff just for fun.
Not sure but it seems to be the “go to” website when looking for homes to buy/apartments to rent. I know I personally use it for that purpose
Yes. It’s a website. Not a company. At least not anymore.
Very popular
Zillow is popular but it's different from Rightmove in the UK, in that they also buy property not just act as a broker.

Everyone has time for an actual discussion.

100? I spend at least 5k

Watching tv shows on my 55 inch tv. Newly bought 800K condo studio in Hell’s Kitchen nyc new construction building. Gobbling up this shitty watery hot chocolate I made
You can get a condo for 800k there?
New construction too. There’s 3 buildings with studios in 800K range it’s amazing. Stones throw from midtown center
500 sq ft or less?
How much are condo fees

I was looking at the holdings in my dad's 401k. How do I convince him to let me actively manage it?

Don't ask. Do it in secret. If you green it, then reveal yourself.

If you decimate it, he'll figure out and report unauthorized access, and get everything restored.

Pelosi Stock Index has PE of 1000....and it is currently undervalued
dang what happened to ocugen
it pumped and then dumped
What it always does
You saw what happened - it had already gone up way past enough, so investors decided they wouldn't gain by hanging around.   
And it would have to fall plenty before it's worth buying in again.. right?  Sell and move on is the obvious thing to do.   
How much you figure it's going to rise in the next 3 months? Or maybe just stick around $11?
Imma throw $100 in whatever stock/fund that has the funniest ticker. (TIL: $CUM isn’t actually a real ticker, lol)

Bought 2 TSLA 940 weeklies the Thursday at broke 900 for $620 a piece. Bought FB for NOV26 325c when trading at $312. Yoloed 4k on Z puts and made 16k profit. 

two weeks. 1400 -> 38k.  Bout to cash out cause no way this keeps up.

Current holdings: Cash, FB 325c NOV26 and FB 345c Dec10

-WSB vet, checking in after some months
But I want to make 100k on metaverse
Buy TSLA *shares* like a boomer 😹
Fkin outstanding!!! I say keep doing what u doing…play it smart which sounds like you’ve pretty much have it down right.
When you make let's say +900%, you can take 5x your initial investment and let the rest run, that way it's psychologically much easier to hodl.
900 to 56k
O.O
Now you can day trade
Sweep it
How should I invest in TSLA today? Got 10 grand to play with... Go.
Just put on tomorrow expiring call that you think tesla can strike. I say 1300
**With your fingers or Computer Mouse DUHH**
I'd avoid weeklies. If you don't want to gamble, choose at least a month out and not a ridiculously OTM strike. The shortest expiry I got for now is December ($1100 strike).
2022 LEAPS
2022 is only a month away but since this is wsb, i guess anything longer than 1dte is a leap
Tired of these fucking hackers hacking my account and buying puts

Who else bought 11/12 Tesla calls today?
Buying at open with whatever I can salvage from GME
I'm too poor to afford any with good potential
I’m not sure I would call 1450 good potential but I’m also poor
More like 11/5 calls
I should’ve after selling my put near the bottom but I was working…
I sold my 11/5 call near the bottom this morning
Fuuuck. Hopefully you profited still. I was up 1k and trying to sell it but I ended up in finally  filling and selling for only like $500 profit. How much higher is this thing going to go lol
I love watching everyone make money. Well everyone except people with roku…
ROKU - classic overreaction. I’m buying this dip and more 🙄🙄🙄

But I'll still be struggling to recover my losses on SQQQ.

SKILLZ reversing today's gains
All gains lost ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Buying OCGN too big of a dip
I agree. Like over 20% including after hours. I would e bought in at $12 tbh. Just didn’t trade much today
3x margin on ROKU dip. LETS FUCKING GO
Gah damn they let you 3x? Who’s your brokerage?
some retard
Must be, but fukit moneys cheap
Coming up on 400k NW at 31, hopefully that makes me good enough for u boys. Switching to a 15-year mortgage kinda fucks. Knocking out principal makes me wet in my bussy.

Note: this is all while losing approximately 50-70k gambling in my lifetime. Roughly.
Why’d you switch to 15
Lower rate
this guy knows
Equity in the home keeps it away from my gambling hands…
My house has turned out to be the best investment I ever made…and I never intended it to be an investment. Which is probably why. I just knew it made financial sense since no matter what I need a roof over my head lol
Nice job man. I feel the same. My realtor thought I overpaid when I bought 4 years ago, but home is worth about 25% more now, so I'm happy.
Yeah, that's exactly how it is for me too. If I put it into my house, I can't withdraw it and gamble. Best way.
Interest rate on my 30 was 4.25%. Got a 15 for 2.6%. I know it's not the best math move, but I would love to pay off my house. Paid off my car earlier this year and it felt great psychologically.
Word yeah I was just curious and you’re right the psychological/well-being feeling of having that shit paid off will be awesome
For sure. Not having to owe anyone anything will/would be nice.
Jesus, ROKU really is a shit stock huh
I'm excited for Sweetgreen's IPO

Bruh, I keep getting letters about refinancing my home. Anyone else? It's so tempting
Only on days that end in Y.
Confusion
I get those every day. Monday, Tuesday, etc. It's an old saying and I'm an old soul
Oh ok lmao I was sitting her trying to decipher your code
I can only speak for my parents and many people in their generation. 

They constantly refinanced every time they had any equity so they "could pay off bills with higher interest rates" only to then spend up their credit cards on vacations and other crap they didn't need. Rinse, Lather, Repeat. 

The end of the story? They're in their 70s living off social security. They will pass down no wealth because they accumulated no wealth.
What state? I’m a broker I can possibly help you pm me
> I am a bot. I don’t take orders from humans.
Ah fuck
NJ. I just bought last year though. How could refinancing help me really?
Gme fdd
Better post the SKLZ loss porn you degens
How did no one know they wouldn't make earnings?
Who woulda thunk it
Have they had earnings call yet?
-13% AH
Robinhood puts on this glitch shit
The question is. Do we double down on degeneracy and buy the dip tomorrow?
Why do I get hard when ARKK goes down when I don't have any position open?

Is it gay to feel schadenfreude for a stock?
Nah, it's not unusual.

Plenty of people here still feel like that whenever GME or AMC go down.
Buying back into SKLZ once it bottoms 5th time riding this beast.
Casual question: when you determine how much you "made" in a week on the market, do you count everything? Like 401k, Roth?
> I don't have a 401k or Roth. I just count the money in my wallet and on exchanges that is mine to spend.
Uh okay VisualMod but we don't discuss fake internet money here
I count what the RH chart tells me when I click "1W"
Do you ‘invest’ with those accounts?
Nah I only count what im willing to take out in the near future, so only my options/gambling account
Sure, but bucketing it into tax-advantaged (retirement) vs not-tax advantaged so your balance sheet clearly delineates between what you can touch now vs later
Here I just mention stocks/securities.
Yes. But the IRA is buy/hold more conservative investments. They go up, tax deferred.
Only my gambling account.
I count the millions of dollar bills spilling out of my money bags
Yea I talk in nw terms
Just my options portfolio.
Had to pull out 20k for hospital shit. Left myself 500 to play with. Guess what I thought spy was going to do? 🤣🤣 anyway as I was reading the minutes, I saw tapering and thought, ok a little pullback before a rip. Then came shreks dick 🤣🤣 and all I heard in my head was oh no (in the gay dude from family guys voice)
That gay gentleman is named Bruce. 

And I feel sorry for all the money you killed.
Bruce? Never knew that. Now I have a name to the voice
Someone else won your money, so you did a good deed with it and made someone happy.

Zillow about to kill these sellers.
Is Zillow now too cheap to ignore?
Plenty more to drop
Honest question, what is Zillow’s purpose moving forward?
snooping into your neighbor's homes to see what they look like
👀
> Zillow is a real estate website.
Is or was?
It’s the yellow pages now
Still a good site for home listings and the average person to find an agent. Zillow was just dumb af buying at the top and selling low
zillow is like craigslist for houses
Paid service for snooping on people.
Almost every women I know looks at Zillow weekly if not daily. They have a huge purpose and aren’t going anywhere
Should I just set my ocgn shares to sell now? Like if there’s any increase it’ll be at open right?
You're all ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5958)
Tomorrow’s runner Play is definitely BYND. This price action is similar to last time when it ran from 104 to 157+, Load up any dips, it has slight pullbacks then runs higher. All of us Retailers remember that day well. 50+ dollar run. In addition 10’ min ago BYND was on CNBC🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
To be fair the chart looks like a dump tomorrow lol
What’s the position?
Chart looks ready. I plan on getting in PM before the potential gap run. Hopefully i can catch it though.
Strike and date?
I usually hold large shares positions. Instead of using the option route. But I’ll do that from time to time. Sold my Tesla calls today for a return of 850%. But going back to your question  the $120 strike call for Nov5th on BYND has a really interesting volume amount which is Identical to the last time when it made a 50+ move.

Yea, let’s pick and choose some non native trees to plant and become invasive
That's one way to go.  Or, if you are a logging company you plant whatever native tree makes you the most return on investment and/or grows the fastest.  You get to set the spacing for the trees as well, to facilitate forest management, like cleaning out underbrush more easily so your goddamn state doesn't burn down.
We aren’t talking about business plans or forest management, we’re talking about this extremely expensive plan to plant 1 trillion trees to combat climate change……..
You is DUMB. **D U M B** DUMB!

New York City is the most overrated place on earth
You've clearly never been stabbed by a hobo on meth in San Francisco.
False. Have you even tasted a lox Bagel?
No, but have you done your squats today?
Hey friend!!!! I haven’t done any today, but I was just looking squat techniques to add to my routine for tomorrow…

Got broken up with after fuckin 10yrs so I’ll be hitting the gym a lot more to deal 😕
Hey, well good! Gym time is the best way to deal with a break up. Ask me how I know! I'm here for ya
Guhhhh. Whenever i go visit family.. the bagels at fareway are so fucking good compared to the hard shit you get in the northeast.
I now need to know your most underrated
Twin Cities
Oh my fuckin fam over here hell yes you're right AF
pizza is good
Not really.  I thrived there but you gotta be rich or have rich relatives.
NYC has a ton of good food though. so if that's your thing. it's nice. wish they had a better viet presence though, but Texas and CA got that.
LA food scene wipes the floor with NYC but y’all ain’t ready for that conversation
Lots of good shit in LA but if you want a decent burrito you gotta head either north or south
I disagree. I didn't realize this was a contest. imagine getting worked up over which city has better food. are you poor and can only visit 1 ?
Wait you live here? So stfu, gtfo and go home to Minnesota quitter

Imagine being so anti gun to the point of being gun phobic. Then picking one up and murdering a woman with it…and then playing the victim 🤡
That’s like someone with Aquaphobia drowning in the ocean and blaming the ocean
I don't think I ever came as hard as I did as when I shot a M1 Garand and hearing that Pinggg
Aw fuck yeah man.  i own one :)
Hot
Meh.  Come back after a M256 or M242
my gf calls me the bushmaster ;)
Because you constantly jam under pressure?
hmm. well played.
To be fair the firearm should have been cleared and checked about 5 times before it ever made it to his hands. 

Tragic accident.
You're right- it should have been checked and cleared by Baldwin. He violated every rule of basic gun safety
But thats not the point, he has preached to everyone for the past 10+ years that no one should own a gun and that there are no good gun owners and that “Guns kill!!” When here he is CHOOSING to use real guns in his movie….where the fuck does he get off
But thats not the point, he has preached to everyone for the past 10+ years that no one should own a gun and that there are no good gun owners and that “Guns kill!!” When here he is CHOOSING to use real guns in his movie….where the fuck does he get off
The producer should share the blame with the actor who pulled the trigger.
Guns r gud calls on AR50s

He’s coming back soon. I can feel it.
Cool story bro
Did you show him your tits?
The funny thing is that these days, no one can really disagree that we’re at the tail end of a massive bubble. 

The disagreement is just over whether it pops in five days or goes on another five years.
Did you even listen to the call?
This is bullshit comment disguised as being smart. Lol
What's Tesla hitting tommorow bois?
Ground zero
No fucking clue

Should I get hot buffalo wings from
Dominos?
Idk man don’t you think that’s to pricy for you after what happen today? :(
Git some
Are they good?
Boneless are ok, if you get bone in they arrive slightly soggy and warm with disappointment.

Idk, if I want wings I usually goto the source rather then deliver
Get me sum wangs
Wingstop could really use the support on their cashflow statement
> I don't care about Wingstop
Yeah, fuck wingstop
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
order plain wings and make your own sauce. itll be 1000% times better

1 part franks red hot and one part unsalted melted butter. add cornstarch to thicken to desired thickness.

The real question is would you punch him if he had a gun?
Depends if he is concealing or helicoptering it

Not to get political in WSB, but neither guy was a good choice. However I think I'd rather have the dude people vote for than quit giving a shit about over the one people vote for then can't stop talking about/praising every single day while explaining their greatness and ignoring their mistakes. No cult > cult.
America is dead. Too divided across too many important categories. Homogeneous societies with focused goals will win eventually(China 100yr plan).
We've lost wayyyyy more freedom in the last year than before
What freedoms did you lose this last year?
I don't like either of them but we've been getting fucked on by the government this year with mandates and we are definitely trending in the wrong direction. Government  over reach is strong this year
Okay? You didn’t answer my question.
Freedom to choose Vax stance and not be demonized or Beaten into submission by divide and conquer ploys for 1
Still better than trumps imposed 14 day house arrest quarantine rules.
It's not a Trump or biden thing. Ask your self when you buy groceries buy gas buy anything if you are better off this year than last. Supply chain is broken and we are downtrending. That is all
I’m not vaccinated lol, at this point you’re just blowing smoke out your ass homie. 

Just because you’re a big pussy doesn’t mean you’re losing freedom.
I fought for mine.. 6 different countries. 2 different 6 month deployments. Defended liberty and freedom all across the globe. You can ask yourself if you did the same. Also thank a veteran on the 11th. Thanks
Then before?
I don’t disagree, but in my opinion, we’re currently doing a pretty good job giving up freedoms without a Fuhrer.
Freedoms? What freedom is even left?
Move to North Korea and tell me
Can’t, they won’t let me on a plane because I don’t have a mask or a vaccine card 🤡🤡🤡
Seriously… how many boosters do we need to show this month to buy a loaf of bread comrade!?
Of there are people fanatical about Biden. 

The problem is people who would make great politicians have no desire to be one.
I would be a great politician.

Haha dude you are FINE.

How come nobody is talking about the fact the GME is gaining momentum? Yesterday it was up 4% today up 5.45%.....
They hate it here. It’s been climbing for a month then it will die to the 160-170 range then go back up
Its out of the penant now.
because the entire market is ripping

5% on a ticker is basically a red day now

we had a +1000% gain like a week or 2 ago
So when its up another 8% tommorow nothing?
> The average lifespan of a butterfly is 2 weeks.
when half the market is up 10% in 2 days, GME going up isnt anything special
Its up 23% from friday.
What's there to talk about? It has no fundamental basis, the retail holders have become a doomsday cult, it doesn't have an icon like Musk behind it.

Not impossible to make some money on it but there are 100 places I'd rather dump money rn.
Just dont fomo on its way too $1000
Never heard of ryan cohen?
OCGN took my soul today. Fuck
Thanks for making my portfolio look good GME.  Without you I would be another 🌈🐻 in shambles.  You bulls gotta admit, TSLA market cap is completely retarded and profit WILL be taken.
Rocket is not actual rocket company

Puts
Im a bull but still got 2 SPY 460p 11/19
I bought puts when it crossed 463 and was shook af when they got immediately destroyed
I was up 15% on that slight pullback before we skyrocketed to 465. Shoulda fucking sold and bought calls
Literally minutes before the planned fed announcement, while spy was in the high 461s I bought 462 calls and then BAM +85% INSTANTANEOUSLY and it pulled for a sec so I cashed out and YOLOd into the countering 463 puts to ride profits back down... and basically negated the mad money call profit I had JUST made. Should have just paused and held for another 5 minutes to confirm trend and rode those bitches into the closing bell. SPY can be a real comedian I tell ya. I'm learning the hard way to pause and appreciate good gains.
Hope you didn’t need that money for anything. It’s almost more convenient to just, you know, not have it.
Oh i just have a feeling. Lets say just hedging
 Bois, Grls, Others, I hope you made some money this week. If not, at least you’re in the right sub. You to VisualMod.
VisualMod, did you make money this week?
Its silence speaks volumes
Haha 😂 others

Did you know more than 50% of all wildlife is estimated to have died in the past few years due to the anthropocene extinction event?
That’s the stupidest shit I ever heard go outside and look around dummy
Yeah I notice a lot less wildlife. In fact the only animals I'm likely to see are livestock even though it's a small farm in the woods

Do you actually go outside?
Yeah there’s fucking animals everywhere
As many as there used to be 20 years ago?

BB flat tomorrow guys, sorry. I know this stock too well

PLTR flat too.
BB won't be flat if the rest of the meme's are running. After a day like today, highly doubt they'll be flat.
Probably fuck with BBBY and LCID tomorrow and hopefully make some OCGN money back
Jumping in late on OCGN worked so well for you, you decided you want to do it again x 2
This is the way though??
all in on F, PLUG, AMC. these babies gonna 💦💦

My brother in law thought if calls expire ITM that means you get straight up profit with no downside (cause you're in the money, right?) and then said he got really close with SPY calls once and why am I having a panic attack?
On robinhood if ur itm they will sell it automatically at 3 pm unless you have the cash go buy all the stocks. I done it before and it’s automatic , I’m assuming other apps do the same?
It used to not be automatic on RH. There’s a lots of reasons why people here say get a real broker besides the conspiracies.
Ah I see. Idk I kinda like that people are dumb af lol
Yup, we all loved it a few years ago. Loss porn will never compare to “can some one explained what happened!!?”
This is how I ended up with 200 shares of Nokia against my will, forgot I freed up cash

No worries! I’m still holding and +15% lol

This has to be endgame
End of what?
Guys have it rough lowkey, I just sit at university all day because I'm poor trying to become less poor with trading but if I was a 21yr woman instead that was \~6/10 attractiveness I unironically could have some 27yr paying for everything.
Just go gay.
Fair
Pays twice as much ( got payed 50 bucks to let a guy suck my dick once)
Neat
Eh more blan than anything, 50 bucks is 50 bucks tho.
50 bucks is often times 50 bucks
But you would be sucking a losers dick every night
Yes, but I’m a loser who sits here and does nothing 24/7 anyways so that’s definitely not the worst.
But it would be the wurst.
The liverwurst
Imagine actually thinking this way.

Maybe that’s why you’re poor.

Have some ambition man.
I was thinking how much I agree with you. Then I realized.
WHOOSH
Don't be an a little bitch. You want money then just fucking work hard for it, don't be salty if some girls get it easier than you.
He can always slob on the nob for money. Guess y’all are right about the lack of motivation.
Idk any 21yr woman who secretly enjoys being with a 27yr old for money.
I’m 31. My GF is 20. 

I pay for everything. Yeah our age is a gap, but the connection, holy shit.

Do your thing.
Gross
Good connection?
He meant between her dick and his asshole.
Oh yeah i got great wifi
She’s my age mentally.

One of those love at first sight things. I’ll let her say it first, but fuck I’m robbing the cradle and want it to last
Do it bro. Don’t blame you at all
5 years ago she was 15.
I like to say she was 9 and I was 20 when Game of Thrones came out.

Her parents LOVED that at our first dinner at my house. (Sarcasm)

Luckily for me he’s also a contractor and we knew each other from a few job sites over the last decade.
Bet she loves to fuck
Only girl that can keep up so far
Lost so much money today. The kids will be going to school hungry tomorrow. Hope you bulls are happy!

You fantasize about sucking dicks?
Yeah but I want girls to watch and call me cum dump and cock holster 😭
Smoke signals.
It’s to do with cuckolding. Sort of
The signal is one big puff, 2 little puffs, 2 big puffs, 3 little puffs. It’s a surprisingly common phrase, probably because native villages mostly messaged each other for wifeswapping. If you add another little puff to the end, it asks the girl if they are down to snowball.
Just go to the local adult book stores.  All the anonymous oral sex you could hope to give or receive.  Hope ya like dude's though.
I don’t like dudes. Just have a fucked up dick sucking fantasy to be emasculated by women lol

Banbet it or stfu cuck
The fed should shut down r/antiwork to combat inflation. It's part of their twin mandate, after all.
Is it me or are the r/antiwork folks a bunch of crybabies? I grew up poor but didn't stay there. And I didn't once think the world owed me shit.
Dude was I the only one riding uranium today? My CCJ calls are up 90% and it'll keep running.
If BB and AMC could do as well as GME I’d be so golden

Oooh I might buy more NKLA puts for that
Good idea what day do I need to buy puts again?
Any options privileges I guess. You're buying the right to "sell" the stock at a better price. So when it drops you can collect the difference.
my entire portfolio is nkla calls. 30% shares are shorted and the chart shows ski slope titties that will make certain that a puff of good news blasts this thing up 30%
You expect good news tommorow for earnings?
I heard they have a nice drawing of truck hanging on their wall that’s pretty bullish

Gah dam today had me by the balls. Went balls deep into GME, got profit, went back in and lost it all and went -30%. Then yolod into Z puts which I tried to sell but couldn’t. So now I’m almost even for the day much  more than earlier in the day. Fuck hopefully I can get out of Z puts tho

Don’t thing it’s a good move?
With that much equity you can adjust strikes to get a little better spread. Maybe reduce profits but also reduce risk. I think FB calls are fine but the shake outs will really be rough
Make the calls more ITM?
I checked and your dates look pretty good, those are in play and on the right strikes. NOV 19th date you could roll a little to 325-335 spread during a peak or a valley. That stack would have less profit but more delta/less IV. and you would want to avoid getting shook out of that one because more ITM = greater imminent loss on a large movement.

A lot of people playing 350 and 340 there. And then I’d keep an eye for openings in December.
IRM is an interesting name to watch tomorrow post-earnings; if it gets volume could run.  Older business with a lot of skepticism over whether their 20th century information storage model makes sense now; but so many large businesses use them still.

29 million shares short but volume is only 1-2 million per day on average.

And it's at ATHs with volume coming in past couple of days.  Any big burst over $50 and it could run a fair bit.  All will depend on their earnings numbers and volume though.

Might be worth playing with weeklies if volume comes in big.
Hold my F options til it hits $25
I was lamenting getting out of Z 65c and into BBBY 19.50c at the last minute. This could be juicy.
Hmmm
FWIW it's died down a bit and Z is up enough that I'd probably have been better off staying in those, but we'll see.
Man I really hope CAKE can recover. Can anyone shes me some light on this tasty company?
Amd gonna bust tomorrow
good. buy more shares on a dip
Can gme go to $230 tomorrow so I can exit these shitty calls!

I disagree

If I bought some it’d probably double in the interim.
Can you buy some please?
Oh shit. I’m on my third IPA. I forgot im already long a 290P. This indicates the bottom for COIN probably.
I appreciate your service. 

I owe you some IPAs brother. 🍻
I'll open a short position depending on how tomorrow's trading goes. If it can break the resistance at 345 (big one w/ IPO bag holders) then it's off to races and I'll open calls through earnings. 

If it rejects and double tops and doesn't break 330, I'll also buy calls. 

Anything else it's puts city.

But if it breaks that 345, it's open season to the 420-ish zone. Big tendies to be made on monthlies.
Teach me to be like you people
Start with losing a lot of money w/ FOMO moves. Then bump up to options bag holding. From there, get frustrated and sit-out for 6 months. Then lose more money.

Once you've lost enough money, you will have a breakthrough and realize any advice on this sub is late and the news makes shit up. 

Once you get to the point where you ask why Jack Dorsey would tweet hyperinflation bullshit 3-days before earnings, your training will commence. 

Then the hard work begins. Find me when you get there.

Oh shit dude. 

That was the most fucked up episode for me as well. 

“Me and you gganbu now.”

BTW- after you finish watching the whole show go back to that episode and rewatch it.
I assume they meant that this reality we’re living is a sad squid game episode
That one made me tear up
I knew immediately that you were on episode 6 after reading this comment.
The after hours on bbby has my puts shaking in their loafers
So much exuberance, myself included, that rug pull is no doubt imminent. Whatever buy calls on any random four letters. Works until it doesn’t.

Any hope for my ATVI calls. Averaged way down expiring in January 77.5c
Yikes😬
I'm just hoping for a bounce above 70 in the upcoming weeks. Took my avg cost from like $6 to $2.5 so hoping to scrape out with a minimal loss
Certainly possible. 

But the market is impatient. Revenue delays likely to keep a lid on this one until at least next quarter. No bounce whatsoever today. Chart on a larger time frame is now in no man’s land. My guess is it goes lower. 

Might want to peel a few off before the theta gang comes for you with the pitchforks. Can always make it back somewhere else. 

Permanent loss of capital is the killer.
yes this is a bubble but unfortunately for you the bubble is made out of reinforced concrete

If VIAC doesn’t do anything good tomorrow, I will dump my 12k Stocks
Shit has done nothing
I am buying it since Hawang dump and it never went anywhere even mid $40’s.. that sucker was >$100.
Don’t understand why with so much money you bought shares instead of selling puts on it, you would’ve been making money all these months with its flatness instead of nothing with shares
I started investing just this last February and learning.. now I feel more comfortable in options. I will be doing that soon.
It has done nothing in a very long time, I support you dumping it
$12k of stock or 12k stock units?
12k stocks… I should’ve bought TSLA when it was in $600 and double my investment

Orange juice

With or without pulp

Why
Orange juice with pulp is like eating a girls ass with hair
So.... with pulp :)
Is this...a negative assessment? Or should I go buy OJ with pulp?
Some pulp. Feels like actual juice then.
I'm just gonna say u gotta have pulp in that shit or you're lying to yourself, it's like tryna not taste alcohol when ur drinking; you're poisoning yourself and feeling good, gotta come to terms lol
With, because I’m not paying for orange colored chalk water
Without pulp straight up. With pulp in a mimosa.
Without, I don’t like texture in my drinks, it’s really that simple.

What are we thinking? Spy pull back or boom
Well I’ve got calls so shit better boom.
I'm also overleveraged in calls
I’m gonna be honest with you; I’m a diesel mechanic who’s tired of working and likes to spend way too much on my car. I just buy when you say sell, and sell when you say buy. That is the extent of my financial knowledge.
I'm going to be straight with you, I'm a college student about to go into grad school, I'm really just gambling a small percentage in hopes I can cover my bills on the profits so I don't need to take out loans, I buy spy calls on dips and thats about it

Automod keeps deleting this but OPEN door founder is claiming to have had profitable Q3 on twitter, founder says home flipping was profitable for them

Ppl saying he's providing MNPI by doing so
Idk how else to provide this to the sub automod keeps deleting my screen shot coz it's not DD and then deleting it coz it's a duplicate anyways u degens gotta know coz everyone else knows
Do you have a position?
No I don't
Zillow exiting out of homebuying is massive for Opendoor, a slightly successful guidance could send it
altho the more i think about it this founder being this loose lips means all the big players already know  
could be a toss up
Is there a single bear left?? Genuinely curious if anyone has SPY puts here
The higher it goes without a decent pull back, the more people will consider getting puts. Most bears are just bulls who turned into bears. 

It's the perma-bears who are dead.
RIP Chanos
Yup
No, the market has been quite unbearable lately
If you ain’t hedged with spy poots you done fucked up
Yep. And QQQ calls
Sure they will backfill a little at some point so they can ramp up the run to 500 next year , have to give some back to refill
Given up on spy puts, sqqq calls or just puts on weak companies that may self implode anyway.. a downward market would only help

I’m fine with this but there should be ZERO ability to withdraw funds before 60 and you should only be allowed to withdraw 5% a year of the lump sum starting at 60. The whole point of social security is to prevent degenerate people with zero savings from being homeless at 65. We don’t need a elderly homeless problem in this country on top of all the other shit we have.
How else is that politician gonna get their networth to 150 million on a 150k salary? Cmon man don't be selfish here

ok idk if $AMZN is up to something with $CVS, but the .com/cvs link isn't an error message and the page source has dates 11-02 and 10-25 in it. [Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p50n5p/amzn_is_up_to_something_with_afrm_obsessive_dd/) this meant something
Ok this is kind of interesting. It’s redirecting with this parameter marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER which is for the us region, not that telling. But look at what you get if you paste the other param value into google.
the url itself seems rather boring. I wonder if the link has been set up for a long time since CVS rejected them in like June or something and maybe I just now noticed it. I wish I could tell what specifically the 10-25 and 11-02 dates in the page source were referring to. Seems like a crapshoot. If CVS weren't already at the moon I would totally load up

Some people just don’t prioritize responding because they are afraid of the response they might get. Some people are to the point where it is a phobia.
Nah they ain’t that interested bro. I mean if a girl texts/snaps me back every 5 minutes she must not have a lot going on in her life and I’ll start taking a long time to reply… it’s not attractive…

When I simp after girls I try and catch myself… like leave that bii on read, instead of replying before bed, answer in the am

If she knows ur at work, don’t answer till u finish

Obv everyone’s on there phone all day, but trying to talk all day is clingy and unattractive, 

Also start talking to a lot of girls at once, even if it’s just one you like… ur game will be better and she’ll feel it

Also if you feel she’s about to lose interest, stop replying soon. Make sure u end it first. This is Big.
Ok
When you’re sexting a girl your r/HotWife cuck fantasy and she says “I like this, not gonna lie it’s making me a little horny😈” … then she stops replying right after. WTF 

Did she just go to sleep or she lied to me 😪🤣
She probably called a bull to get fucked and she’s gonna tell you about it in the morning.
Unironically would be the best outcome for me 🥲
I’m a hope salesman
How is possible so many subreddit have porn and how so many of you know all of them?
Cause I’m a sexual degenerate
A purveyor of only the finest lulu asses
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)
The line between that’s hot and I’m creeped out is razor thin
Hmmmm peaked your curiosity tho. Like you wanna look away but you can’t. You’re probably thinking “omg how can men want their girl to be fucked by someone else and why do I think it’s kinda hot” lol 👀
… you married? 😉
Bachelor for life. Why?
The joke was if you have a hot wife, and are Into this fantasy… then I would…

Edit. For further clarification- I read the comment as you had a hot wife, and we’re into being cuckolded. So I was suggesting the I could potentially satiate such a fantasy.
Lmao sorry bro. Yeah nah, that’s just the name of the sub but it is about cuckolding. No wife or girlfriend here tho, just a random girl I was talking to and brought it up.
The answer is always add pltr
And never make profit ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I’ll pass, pltr only fucked me
Why does everyone look for the next big thing on what’s most shorted or has high short interest? 

So many of these companies people are throwing their life savings in are shorted to oblivion for a reason, take SDC for example, 780m in debt which is almost half its market cap, honestly that’s a ton of braces they’ll have to put on to pay off that huge debt.
You do realize what sub you are in?
Because distorting market mechanics is the new investing
That's what kids were doing like 6 months ago, luckily I haven't seen short interest mentioned in a while. But people are dumb
Because they are trying to get rich quick and don’t have a lot of money to spend so it seems like it’s easier to 10x a $5 stock.
so what do you say? buy gold, invest in bonds and dividend stocks?
Instead of trying to get everyone to buy all the public floats to pump and dump shorted stocks? Yes
It starts with G and ends with E. 
Mmmmmmmm, do you understand it?

If not then no Lambo for you! 
Here are a few more missiles to make it serious enough for this sub. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Shut up buttfucker
Banbet it or stfu cuck
Banbet it or go back to /r/Investing
you literally coulda cashed out this morning and gotten back in for 10% cheaper but you "hold or nothing" idiots still think youre doing the best out of anyone here
ROKU dead af after earnings. Two days ago, the CEO exercised his call options and sold the underlying shares.

You apes need to pay attention.
And yet you decide to post this now in hindsight instead of helping people make gains before the market closed?
Why is it his responsibility that other people don’t research what they’re buying 2dte options on lmao
cuz he didn't notice it either until afterwards.
For real, that would have been useful yesterday asshole.
It's literally an article on Robinhood.

Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words.

Bought SPY puts at close - good or bad move?
I haven’t made money with them
You might make money at 9 30, but by 9 40, you'll be fucked
Perfectly sound move. Makes perfect sense with current  market conditions.   Sooo kiss that money good bye.
Buy puts during the biggest bullish trend of all time LOL I lost 6 k last week trying to do that, almost made it all back these last 3 days with calls
Dude just buy calls when you feel like buying puts
Don’t think we’re meaningfully dropping til EOY harvesting

Squid game is overrated
Why would you say this to their prime targeted audience?
that shit was fucking stupid but the yellow bois gonna downvote tf out of you for keeping it real
Oh yeah spy is looking prime for a dump
Imagine looking at today's rally and thinking this.
Bruh WHAT. Have you SEEN the last few hours? 

Never seen buying pressure like that in my whole life I reckon
If I had a nickel
Maybe, but I doubt it

Yup but I’m not going short just buying cheap protection and taking profits

I bought a shit ton of vix calls today and I couldn't be happier to lose money on them. Means my portfolio isn't on fire.  Visa and FB are still lame though.
!banbet TSLA 1100 1w

Might double my position on $SDC tomorrow.
Why
Have shares and calls in SDC.  Been a slow climber this week waiting to break out.
Nice.  I’ve got some calls as well, but mostly shares.  Think I’m just going to buy more shares since I don’t want to take the extra risk in case the earnings call next week disappoints.
Why did $SPY increase today if Fed is going to stop purchasing BONDS? Shouldn’t we have seen a drop or is this drop for Nov Thanksgiving weekend?
no to everything you just said.
The market probably priced in a much stronger reduction
ah yes. The virgin retard who has been trading for 3-6 months and thinks they know the market and what it should do.
Why the hostility?
There's certain rules you got to follow when you in these streets
It was priced in and when no new news was released 🚀
I mean a 15B reduction out of 120b/month isn't the same as stopping. They are telling us they will begin the long process that is all.
Priced in ffs
Do most of us think that fake internet money is ridiculous and stupid? Yes. Would any of us short/buy puts on it long term? <5% of retards here would.

That's the same analogy for TSLA. Valuation is ridiculous but you must be a true retard to actually short it.

how much higher will spy go?
Yes
550 and then 250
Both horribly wrong

SPY all the way. I bet all the bears were waiting for SPY to drop down today. Nope. JPOW came in and made SPY jump way up. Bears are screwed today. Let's go SPY. Keep climbing up
Big mouth season 5 drops on Friday
Can stop. Did stop. GameStopped.
Booo 👎
Are you guys this boring irl
Yea
Play me in chel bro
I am even more boring and even more retarded.

Too late and what’s the catalyst now there’s WHO approval?
Manufacturing deals, Canada approval, and US approval all of which are in the works and will be announced with no warning.

WHO was a pre-catalyst confirming the vaccine is good and safe and effective.  Now we need something tangible to generate revenue.
Bought calls at the low today, and then it went lower.
Rug pull is coming
are you serious?  its going turbo tomorrow AM on a full market gamma press 

Friday tho... maybe a quick dip
JPOW literally just had a press conference explaining why they will not be pulling the rug.
This is why you lose money
If SPY hits $500 before Thanksgiving I will be a happy happy man
weird way to say "I will not be a happy happy man"
Stop before you fuck it up with your hopes and dreamed.

It’s just too damn easy. Any bears alive ?
ROKU IS GOING TO TANK HARD PM TOMORROW. BLEED MF BLEED 😤. REBOUND FAKE AND GAY
Companies are reducing 401k incentives and people are trying to become financially independent from jobs they are unlikely to stay in and the looming threats to social security is leading people to buy indexes that are historically consistent performers, if they really put money into an IRA or buying automatically and don't check stocks we could really never see a major drop as everyone just doesn't look or panic sell
Is there any buy the dip opportunity on Zillow once the dust settles or no ?
I would be cautious with Z. They are sitting on a pile of houses they will end up dumping for a huge loss and they laid off 25% of their workforce. Doesn't sound good to me.
Home flipping was 67% of their revenue. It will take a long time for them to recover.
Yeah. WSB acting like it’s going insolvent. Always inverse them
Falling Knife. Wouldn't even trust its first dead cat bounce green day.
You can buy the dip in the housing market when they liquidate their assets.
Will they though? What if they just hold it for many years
can a non ape give me some confirmation bias for these gme calls i’m stupidly holding
Good news, you are for sure going to lose money.
You bought them at peak IV after GME already peaked for this run.

You are 100% mega FUCKED
:’)
Strike and date?
235 this friday. bought when it was hovering around 220 today lol… i looked away and it fully dumped and never recovered much. was a ballsy yolo hoping for a big swing up
> 235 this friday.

Holy shit even 210s are fucked because of the drop in IV.

DOUBLE FUCKED
Momentum is there, you should be fine. I have 10 250c for this Friday. Could have made 20k if I had sold before the plunge. Let's see what happens tomorrow.
> Momentum is there

247 -> 217

"momentum"

The last Jedi was ahead of its time
Gonna yolo into PTON puts. The only reason they announced a Spotify deal the day before earnings is because the earnings are FUCKED. They want to good news to come first, the bad news will come tomorrow ah…
What strike and price?
Idk yet. Probably $90 or $85p. Still deciding
Are they going to give their report AH ? Right ?
Which one of you morons convinced me to buy BBBY today?

Some interesting news out of Germany and Jpm stopping mso buys.
What happened after hours? Couldn't break 11 all day and then plows through randomly at 6pm?
Let’s go SKLZ!!
anyone watching CHGG? Seems like a good long term play after it stops hemorrhaging
got 200 shares for 32.5 and holding 50x 35c 11/19 for an average of $1.58/contract
why so short term? You could get April 50C for the same price.
i wanted near the money plus saw buyers stepping in. if my 35c go ITM, will cash it out and roll iit up to higher strikes
Roku... more like... GUHku
Anyone have any idea why DWAC's option table has 6K open interest at the 10 bid for December 17th? I assume that represents failure to launch for the SPAC merger, but its a massive bomb on the table and gives me concerns about selling puts for that month.
> I'm not sure what you're asking.
He’s asking if you are a virgin, nerd!
I'd be scared of selling puts on that at all right now.  There's a decent chance it's a rug pull.
/u/Momma_Sophie being banned while someone like /u/theCramps can still post is proof there's no justice in the world

Hate to say it but SPY 460 tomorrow and closing the week lower. Nothing changed except the fact that the FED is currently starting the process to end quantitative easing which we now know has and end date. Not exactly bullish.
Make a banbet friend

This sucks. I guess right on both ROKU and ETS but my puts are too far out. ROKU 245 and ETSY 220 and 200. Oh well. Maybe guidance will save me?
what do you mean? your ROKU put should still move on a drop like this, what did you pay for it?
Yep they will still be worth more for sure. Not gonna make them WSB rich tho. L
its all good man half the people here lose tons of money all the fuckin time, and some people are overpaid tech guys or gambling with trust fund money. end of the day if you made money you made money, beats the hell outta losing or doin nothing.
I have 5th 245P so I am still way out of the money.
assuming roku opens under 295 you're still making money on it. if IV spikes from the selloff then even better

I’m so tired of hearing older generations say that what the younger folks are doing is stupid. 

Young folks are never going to say “oh you’re right grandpa, this is stupid” and do something else. That’s not how it works. 

Instead, those young folks will get older and realize they were being stupid all on their own. Same way it’s always worked.
AMC is going to have amazing earnings, best month in October since Covid, I think it will hit 50 by Monday if not Friday. Went up to 13.6 percent to 45 in intraday sitting a 41, good bet, don’t worry about these other shit investments.
Not like they diluted shares to make retail pay off $400 million in debt as well as gave their Ceos as fat bonus
Hell yeah. ROKU puts printing

Put or call? I look at all their past earning report and they making money
Pls $CAKE 🥺🥺 just a 8% increase tomorrow
Man I’m happy that Amd broke 130 but I’m also salty that they waited for this week on little news to do so, and not right after amazing earnings. My stocks are happy but my   Options were not LOL 

Also tesla went up and gme went down the moment I jumped ship. Best part is I had no day trades left to scalp the gains at open before the dip. 

My account going back to 0 after tomorrow. See y’all in a few paychecks
Anybody know the catch with a certain small cap investment fund that’s blowing it up? share price going up and declaring huge dividends?? It seems too good to be true? Usually it is then?

Long or short?
MRO had ok earnings.  Are my 4x $16.5 11/5 calls going to print or become worthless tomorrow?
Today I went long on Z with 1% of my portfolio...you can see how confident I am in the play.

Shares are up 7% and the sold puts are up 33%.  So tomorrow I'll probably be selling if it stays where it is, thinking it made enough for a day.
Let’s go QCOM!

You know what fidelity didn’t do? Expose that capital to the kind of risk that you took to make $3k

Uber puts? This is first time uber reporting earnings
idk man, my dog said it's going down, I'm just relaying the message LOL
LOL. Then lose money
I think it's gonna go up tbh cuz Lyft went up but man my doggo saved me with AFRM this week
I am holding uber calls rn, f it
Uber first earnings. Must smash through the roof
Why ABNB puts?
honestly I think they'll go up, I'm just relaying the message from my dog
So why the fuck did indexes and everything ripped to new all-time highs after we announced tapering??

Let me guess, Tech earnings even though they've been so lackluster that most of these companies are dumping 5 to 20% on earnings...
Because along with the "slow tapering" announcement he said if there are any issues, they will address them and can cut back on their plan. He also said no interest rate raises in the foreseeable future which is just as important. He basically promised a safety net if shit goes sideways.
Thank you for the explanation, much appreciated
Squeeze, apparently a bajillion dollars hedged for the end of the world. They were early
Nope. The tapering announcement alleviated uncertainty, and the market hates uncertainty. The thesis that tapering was going to be the catalyst for a decline in the market was never accurate.

The tapering will be moderate and slow and won't come with a rate hike. That's bullish. Big time bullish.
I would also assume it’s going to be a slow process so the market doesn’t get raped with sell offs and such. So it’s easier for traders to digest 🤷🏼‍♂️
Anyone playing CHGG reversal?
stay 
away
So. The date for Fed's asset taper wasn't specified?
From what I gathered he will reasses rates at the middle of next year or later.
I know that. But asset purchasing tapering starts this month. But never saw an exact date
Yes but people seem to care more about rates being rock bottom for longer. Bullish
I assumed that was immediate.
Middle of the month is my understanding. The exact date doesn't matter much to the market because it's moderate and the liquidity in the market at the moment is more important. We won't see credit markets start to tighten on the taper until some time in the middle of next year, most likely, and banks still have a ton of liquidity.
If that's the case, then I don't see SPY having another red day until January, at the earliest.

Things are going to get extremely silly.
I expect OpEx will do what it does and there'll be profit-taking days... might be some selling off around Black Friday and the end of the year... also, keeping an eye on the debt ceiling standoff coming in early December.

Other than that, though, yeah... super bullish. You never know how people are going to react, but my theory this whole year is that as long as money is on the table to be made, people will be risk-on... and so far that's been true.
What's wild to me is that the international community is getting closer to ratifying a global 15% corporate tax, and the market hadn't even batted an eye.
So the reason for that is because it's flat. Empowered groups like flat taxes because they're impact neutral. When you have graded tax systems, relative socio-economic power is impacted because one person might have a higher rate than another, and this influences to some extent their ability to have buying power or political economy on the basis of any given dollar earned.

If you and I make the same amount of money and I'm taxed at 10% and you're taxed at 15%, and we both buy from the same market, then I have more overall buying power for the same level of effort.

In the case of bracket systems, the intent is to separate groups by overall economic and socio-political power bracket. The reason many of the wealthy are pro-tax increase is because they know that within their strata, the tax impact will be equal, and that means that the impact to their buying power and political economy will be net equal. The calculus basically revolves around whether the product of any spending coming from that taxation will be beneficial. If you have ventures that benefit from government programs, then taxation is a benefit... if your model revolves more around building power through a disruptive power phase, then you're probably looking to break down the existing order because it's in your way of accruing power.

So a 15% flat corporate tax is just a mathematical reduction problem when it comes to buying power because the actual influence of money comes from its ability to be exchanged, and if 15% flat is taken out of any given strata that uses the same market then the buying power basically remains the same relative to others in that class.

LOL
KR calls will continuing to print tomorrow. Likely cashing out expiring positions to fund more long KR calls and shares. KR is a good company with great numbers, it’s about time the stock started printing money.
Nflx puts
Thinking about buying Carvana calls…
I am buying puts instead they using the same failed model Zillow is using. 

Buying cars sight unseen for cash without due diligence. They must be overpaying on every car.
In the car industry as a senior buyer, can confirm.
For real think this the big brain move. Not weeklies but def spring/summer puts.
I’m torn on this. Agree with your points. But on the flip side used cars are going for asking or more. Couple that with Carvana can offer financing while a private party can’t. Just another perspective.
House prices are also going for asking or more yet Zillow managed to lose money on it. 

I watched some interview with Carvana CEO he was talking about them building these giant factory like reconditioning buildings for cars that must be expensive.
When it comes to cars nothing shocks me. People are renting wheels lol
My car just started having some problems and I’ve been thinking about getting a new car, so I’m 100% planning on selling it to one of these places and letting them deal with the repairs.
srsly when i heard they were paying 3-4k MORE for used cars i thought this aint sustainable lol
There’s a Carvana near me that recently got their license suspended because there are legal documents that showed this Carvana facility failed to deliver titles to the DMV, sold motor vehicles without state inspections, and issued out-of-state temporary tags and plates for vehicles sold to customers. I would not buy calls. Not financial advice of course.
Thanks. Puts it is.
Ride the lightning which ever way it takes you my friend
When did Cathie sell? Lol my puts might survive
> I'm not sure, but I think it's now
FYI I have spy calls and TSLA calls so silly is my only bearish play rn
I impulsively bought by the pump and dump campaign.. i should have sold when it was 17… but now holding the bag
Oh rip here comes the slow Futes fade

Earnings are all priced in. Tank time
Time to move on from vaccines to therapeutics
HAHAHAHA... thats the funniest thing I ever heard!

Also there is still the rest of the world even it that was remotely true...
CLNE before earnings.  Could go well, could go down, but this market cap is so low I’m betting on bulls.

Once LCID breaks $40 its game on!
Banbet it shrill
you mean it goes back to $20?
Clearly you don’t look at the chart. It’s had a 200k buy wall at 33. There’s no way it’s going below that. Sold my puts today
Could be an even bigger sell wall but who knows 🤷‍♂️ my avg cost was like 23 and I sold at 40 there’s just so many better stocks out there. I would pick up some dec calls though if the prices weren’t so jacked up
Nice play. I got puts and decided the same thing you did. Better stocks out there. Took the L and already had it in for jpow

> The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stock market index that shows how 30 large companies based in the United States have traded during a standard trading session in recent days. It's not uncommon for stocks to rise or fall 1% or more on any given day, but when this happens with enough frequency and magnitude it can be considered volatility. The DJIA was created by Charles Dow back in 1896 as an average of prices from 12 different industrial companies he tracked every day after work at his local library (hence "Dow" Jones).

Outlook good
Anyone knows what's the track record on Tom Lee's prediction?
Don’t know the exact numbers, however, whenever I heard him make some predictions on SPY, he was mostly spot on. 
Why? What did he say pls?
He see oil could go up above $100. Also, he see S&P could go up 4800 or more

Selling my AMD $130C exp 11/5 BECAUSE THEYRE FINALLY ITM!!!!!!  I got lucky for once
But it might run 🥺
I haven’t been in this situation before. What happens on 11/5 if I don’t sell my call?
Your broker exercises the option and you buy $13k worth of AMD shares
It will auto exercise. If you don’t have money to exercise it, I think it’ll expire worthless. Don’t listen to this guy. Take profit you only have 2dte. At the very least set a stop loss if you’re gonna let it ride, but even then it could gap down overnight.
Yea I’m definitely selling tomorrow at open. I’m expecting a usual run up until 10 and then sideways/down rest of the day
Oh no, you're realizing you need more time to shrill it up
2/2 on GME banbets so far
Why'd you delete it then coward
Is 468c Dec 31 considered a short or long term option?

Just cuz?
Did you see AH yesterday? Went up 20%, settled at 10% but the stock is so beaten down lately it wil definitely move.
I'll keep an eye on it. I've followed it since IPO. Once cancelled an order on a 30c on earnings for 50 bucks that would have hit, you hate to see it

Fundamentally, yes. But fundamentals don't matter right now

Slow down there V.

Let me load up on LEAPS before you bounce back up.
Why did it dump?
Wasn't growing as fast as investors wanted.
$230 1/22 too early?
I'm picking up 225c, same date, if the price stays at $3.50 at open today.

Think Black Friday will boost V a little.
I’m going to keep buying puts until I’m right mom!
you cant keep buying when your account is almost 0

NET puts for earnings? It's up 10x from pre-covid, absolutely ripped in the last month, and insiders have been dumping all through the run up. It's like completely opposite FSLY.
It will gap up 250
Nah.
I have some as well, but I guarantee it will moon, this play is too obvious
I'm looking for some cheap plays for tomorrow what you think? Puts on spy?
that will not be cheap and most likely get theta decayed
LOL sure that sounds like a winner to me
I don’t think spy puts are the move with such a slight taper.
FDs on CVNA earnings tonight
Tesla puts today looking cheap.
I’ll sell them to you!
Absolutely NOTHING about Tesla is cheap !
They aren’t cheap…
He probably buying 100 dollars put![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

He thought stocks split will reduce the price and he can cash out with puts
What a retard hahahaha, he should really look into “making options whole” when the stock splits. He hates money
Buy more puts and lose
That’s not how option prices work dummy
GME STONK TOO LOW IMO
Tomorrow up -3%
That’d be my luck because I covered my EMini short for a huge loss.
Any chance wish hits $10 soon?
I hope. Im loaded on 5.5 calls for the 12th.

If OCugen got approved by WHO for covid why it tanked
##STFU
Maybe because of the 100% run past weeks ?
I think Tesla has a chance of getting to 1400 but only if all the forces arrayed against Elon (NTHS, SEC, various banks, bears, oil/value cuck analysts, etc) are unable to land a punch on his investment thesis. I would give it a 50% probability that the stock is over 1400 by EOY. That still makes the expected value of OTM call options pretty good, however I think adding protective shorter term puts at key levels would be the smarter way to go about it.
1400 EOD
They just have to announce a stock split and it’ll go to 1400
1400 TSLA EoD confirrmed

Bruh I sold the last pump in the form of covered calls and then dumped my shares made like 200% in a week. I'll dump on the pump all damn day
Shhh
You need to start aiming for 200% a day buddy, those are some weak numbers.
Cool story bro.

SPY RSI @ 73.51 
The run was fun but it’s going to come to an end soon. Loading 2 week out puts come market open.
Bullish, because it could’ve been 90
86 seems to be all time high, but average before the correction is around 73-75. It’s 73.5 now. I’m going to bet on history to repeat itself.
This. RSI is on the low side for SPY.
So we don’t use VIX, 10 yr, or tapering any more.

Do you guys think NIO puts is a good idea? Their earnings is next week and their October deliveries sucked
Negative ghost rider. You do realize the lower October deliveries was due to improving their factory, so now they will produce 20% more than the 100% growth that was coming next year, so extra bullish. NIO shouldn’t be under 60 right now. By this time next year I’ll be saying the same thing except 100 because Their phase 2 will be complete and over 1 million cars will be delivered  in 2023

If you look on the 1 year daily chart, the RSI (relative strength index) is at 73.51. Every time in the past that it has gone over 70, it has had a pullback.

Genital measuring time: What’s your biggest share position? I don’t care what ticker unless you wanna spill it. How many shares ya got? I’m pretty weak with my biggest being 1500.  Runner up was gme 1400 that I bought in December and sold in the high 3’s in Jan.

I bought 10x Nov 5 65C Z calls for 2.00 each. Lambo tomorrow??
You’re joking
Is Lambo slang for I'm fuqed? Jk good luck
Idk but I bought 5x 11/12 Z puts today at close 1.65 each ooouuuuu who’s gunna win???
I dunno man... It drilled pretty hard, after it's been drilling. I wasn't sure but Cathy is selling and usually that's bullish AF.
Zillow is fucked and will be pretty fucked for a bit I would imagine after taking a loss like that, not saying we’re not gunna see some kind of technical bounce but seems like it has alil more room to fall

Wanna go see a new dominatrix but when you’re a new client they’re more strict and let you do less… with my usual dominatrix I know I can suck on her big milking titties at least bc she knows me by now. But I want the thrill of a new girl. 

#FUCK
Hate it when that happens.
They always let you do more if you slip em more but I ain’t tryna pay extra either 🤡
Have old girl introduce you to new girl? Maybe she knows other people who she can hook you up with, especially if you pay her a finders fee?
Isn’t that like rude? Lol
I don’t really think so, I mean, she has other clients, why does she have to be your sole provider? Im not saying be like “hey im sick of your Schtick, I need someone new” but something more like “do you know anyone in the industry who does [something specific you haven’t done but would like to do]?”

But I don’t have a lot of experience with doms myself, maybe it is rude.
Seems rude. Like she’s not a good enough domme for you anymore lol I could see her getting really offended
I guess. I don’t think I would take it like that if I was a professional, I would imagine that the persons tastes had simply changed a bit, maybe they wanted someone who was a different size or temperament, or was willing to do something I wasn’t. But I can’t just assume that she would feel the same.
Seems rude. Like she’s not a good enough domme for you anymore lol I could see her getting really offended

Anyone playing $MRNA? Moderna is a lifetime money printer. Covid isn't going away ever.
Nobody will care about covid in a few years.
Most people in Europe already doesn’t care about covid
Tell that to my 335 nov 5 calls I bought a month ago. 10k down the drain.
it's endemic, like influenza .. but flu hasn't  been a non-stop money printer far as  I've noticed. And influenza sure kills a lot of folk.

It’s you.

The dude who pumps that worthless LRC trash.

Get the fuck out of here you failed intern. Jesus Christ I hate the apes and cult stocks but you can get raped by fish.
Why do you hate it lmao, what if the rumors true…. IMO if it was fake GameStop would have already said it was.

Just do basic math and you’ll see the only ones in gme are retail cult stock traders.

I need help. I am a high school student and I need a stock to invest in to make my 2nd hour a little bit more enjoyable. Any ideas?
Just buy weed or something dude. You're a child
How much money are you “investing”?
$2.63 on a subway gift card

sir this is a gambling forum
Suck every dick buddy
DWAC will be a 5x or a -100% within six months.
Qs is heading up and with Rivian ipo coming , it will moon through that
Why are you not out chasing girls? Or guys? That’s what high school is for…

That being said, Best place to start is with companies that you use or are already familiar with…

Pick 10 stocks and follow them. Learn what they respond to and how they move throughout the year. Off the top of my head, I would suggest PLTR, AAPL, SPCE, and maybe FB (if you can afford it). 

Good luck and remember the first one is always free.
Need TSLA to dump tomorrow like Z and OCGN

Being young and liberal is normal. Being an adult and liberal is just sad.

Lol west coast triggered

I’ll tat the WSB guy on my arm if that happens.
I’ll have whatever this guy is smoking.
I wouldn’t mind a red day tomorrow, us bulls need to roll our 2022 OTM SPY calls to a lower strike 💪🏼
You aren’t bullish then.

True bulls buy dips, and momentum. Momentum is the most bullish thing you can do.
Last time I checked you need to realize some profits in order to be successful but hey, more power to you for holding.
Profits?!?

Lol k.

No but best way is to keep buying calls, sell calls yo pay premium and for a little more to roll out leaps, hold calls till 100% profit.

Example, 50x 475 Weeklies, for next week.

As they get closer to ATM pay off premium with a few calls, then hold rest of sell a few more to pay for leaps in December.

See???
That’s not my style.  I buy a couple of dollars above strike 2-3 months out, sell when I have a minimum 20% gain.  That way theta doesn’t bend you over the railing.  Double your money every 5-6 trades and don’t chase the weekly lottos.

Good luck to you
Going to Vegas this weekend staying at the MGM Grand anyone got some ideas for spots to visit?

Already going to the full nude clubs so I got that covered
Binions Steakhouse.

It's a Steakhouse at the top of a spire where you can see all of the old strip while you eat. Frank Sinatra used to eat there regularly.
Saved. Thanks. Definitely seems like a sweet spot

No.
Proud of myself for the few calls I made for what was gonna happen today lol.

Called that
OCGN would go down
CAR would go down and sit around 300
BIRD would do well

Will probably get into SKLZ, DOCN, and CLR depending on how their earning reports go
Why did i listen to the retards about OCGN. I don’t even know what they do and blasted 10% of my small account on it today with calls.
I feel stupid for selling.. I bought ocgn at 30 cents sold when I thought it peaked at 1.80 … my coworker netted 200k on calls from it
Nice!!!
You see? It’s so simple, so simple that a fellow autist/retard can do it. MORE SPY 🕵️‍♀️ BRRRRRRRR🥶🥶🥶💰💰💦😤 current position is (300C-$480S-Expire 11/22-been in since Monday) will possibly look Into position for December&January
My man. You got those at like 0.10 each? I'm in 100 11/19 $475's
0.10 is correct my guy! 
What do you honestly think tomorrow has in store for us? Thanks to Papa Powell for not reaming us!

I have no idea honestly. Got into it based on the topic below

https://redd.it/qjevov
Lmao that’s where I got the help from too!!
Please tell me I wasn't the only one who bought a few INTC calls after seeing that strong close above the 9-day. I know a lot of people don't buy under the 200, but being under the 200 is the best place to be for large rebounds. I couldn't resist. Feb 2022 Calls at a 52.5 strike. Fingers crossed dude.
Can someone send GME down to 205 please for this week?
Fellow $205 put comrade …bought on the second dip, wish I woulda bought them at $245 when I sold the few shares I picked up Monday.
Put a short leg of the call spread at 205 
Darn thing just went haywire for no reason
The reason was you. It happened to fuck over your move.
Back to 185 better. Then you’ll be rich.
Yeah that would be ideal
And I’d be ATM 😂
Two shorts at 195 and 205 . Running out of time on 205
Max pain is 180. However gme is on the start of a next cycle. Likely to see some big swings

Wtf is ryoshi
Lol it’s a new meme coin check out the past 7 days and see the gains. This is on pretty much no news they have an active Twitter and a very active discord fan group telegram 10000 strong. Definitely worth a shot
Oh so it’s a scam.
Lol well maybe you should look into lol instead of just saying shit. I’m not your daddy lol but if you do you will see the anonymous creator has given up complete control of the coin. He’s put it completely in the hands of the people who buy in and own. So you can sit on the sideline like a paper handed bitch or be a big man with balls and take a risk to make some real money your wife’s boyfriend can’t match
Lol

I am betting on $CLF to grow in the coming weeks
Almost bought more today, but wasn't feeling it. Very annoying...this slow drop since last week.
Yea, unfortunately this and X are basically branded as swing trades now.  It’s hard to see them breaking out up without a definitive infrastructure announcement.  On the plus side, buyers step in every time at the low end.
CLNE better not be a disappointment tomorrow
😬
It better do the thing where it goes up on bad earnings like last time
Just get out quick, I bought OCGN 2 dte 16c yesterday and sold at open for a 2 bagger. I feel like both of those are like staring at the sun or your bosses boobs, fine so long as you make it quick
Yea, I did a 100% flip on KR because of the BBBY partnership news today, even tho my calls are good til next week 10 11 and 12 strikes

2022 will be the year of bears. SPY will drop about 25-30% easily.
Keep dreaming cunt
SPY is up ~8% on the monthly. Probably another green day or two. Wild.

Grabbed a few OPEN shares right before close today for shits & giggles.  I’ll wait for EC next week before either making a little profit or bagholding till I die :D
ROKU make longs BROKU
I felt like it was my duty to buy GOOGL calls
What the hell did is up with Roku? I just said $300 is a good floor.

Guess I’ll buy more call spreads on BNTX since they shit out 30% in the last 5min
it's pure coincidence that "tapering" and "tampering" are only off by 1 letter, right?
And tasering
Woo. Tesla blowing through my credit spreads. Smooth brain wont learn my lesson.
This happened to me 4 times in the last 3 months (though not with Tesla). Lost like 15k,now trying to crawl my way out of margin 🥺

when does it expire?
Loaded big boy AMZN and GOOGL FDs at close dont fuck me tomorrow 💀🤡
All I have is a bunch of FB calls for nov26 and dec 10. So probably actually do some work
Bet you didn't expect the double ETSY reversal, huh?
FOMC is done, but im anticipating volatility since it's out of the way. Keeping it simple with a 465c/464p strangle

SDC launching tomorrow, we're set up exactly like last month, decent run up, 25-30¢ pull back, then big jump up to high $6, low $7. Could it go higher? Maybe, but I'm certain about this initial jump
I was upset there wasn't extreme volatility this morning. Thank god I was able to watch them go up eod and can't wait for them to crash tomorrow. Kinda getting off to it
Days like today make it feel like I know what Im doing even though I 100% do not
Ima yolo into ROPE
You think we're gonna see uber tank before earnings?
Nawww
Perhaps I treated FB too harshly yesterday. In calls for 11/12 and 11/29 with 340 strike.

Yeah. Wtf?
Cheesecake factory: Sales across our concepts further strengthened early in the fourth quarter with continued strong contribution from the off-premise channel. We also opened eight new restaurants during the third quarter and fourth quarter-to date periods, meeting our development objective to open as many as 14 new restaurants across our concepts this year. With a strong pipeline in place, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve our targeted 7% unit growth next year, while we continue to focus on driving comparable sales growth and managing through the continued volatility in the operating environment.”

I hope SKLZ goes back down to the 10s so I can buy 10k shares and just sell 100 weekly CCs for $5 a pop and just make that my primary job for the next year while I go back to school. I could survive off $500/week(or possibly more if im feeling spicy). there has to be an easy mode to this market, I just know there is...
you will have to pay taxes on that, so you need enough to survive + pay taxes at the end

If you had 9 week dated AMZN calls how long would you hold them after they went ITM?
8.5 weeks
I'd hold them until the day **before** they have to report difficulties getting some items shipped in time for Christmas.
Let me share this [image](https://imgur.com/a/0rvgTc0) with you… those AMZN calls expired worthless. Take profits dawg
SPYG calls?

Bought 20% otm net puts for 11/5 give me horrible earnings tommorow please
You'll probably be ok, they typically smash earnings and there's a huge sell off.  I've held NET at $51 for like 18 months and it happens like clockwork.  Unless this time earnings aren't great and it moons?  Hmmm
>  I'm not sure.  The market is in a weird place right now and it's hard to tell what will happen with earnings.
Last earnings NET only went down like 3% and then bounced right back the next day.
Yeah I should have clarified, it always bounces back, it's why I've always held - but it typically dumps during the actual earnings call.

Was real tempted to hold my SKLZ weeklies through earnings.  Ended up selling before close for a 30% gain.  I feel like a pussy.  But a less poor pussy.  I'm still conflicted about how I should feel.
You should have already been buying IWM calls but with no interest rate raise this shit is 🚀 look at that chart
ROKU beat on the bottom line but misses the topline expectations (683MM expected, 680MM hit). Tale as old as time that revenue is more important for a high-flying growth company to keep lofty valuations, but the supply chain issues they describe will likely also affect their rivals so a 8% drop I think is a bit too steep.

CAR doubled on earnings.
I have shorted SEAS (seaworld) at 55 and it's 65ish now. Am worried it will double or something. 

Position seems a lot more risky than when I entered, but exiting now would be like admitting defeat and I don't want to.
Double down pussy
I am already leveraged as much as i am allowed.
Never admit defeat and it never happened
Terrible short, high institutional ownership, they won’t let it dump.  Same with CMG and, for now, DASH.
I thought it was overvalued in the 30's so i shorted at 55.
You'd coucil exiting now at a loss to avoid further pain I take it.
Well, I’d say it’s unlikely to moon super hard, so maybe you’ll get a little pullback before earnings.  I’m just saying it’s one of the literal worst shorts in the market.  not saying you won’t maybe get lucky on earnings, it could happen, but the odds are against you.  Not financial advice lol
Uhhgg. I thought it would for sure drop but now i need like a 10% dip just to break even.

I just thought the fundamentals were bad i didn't account for the institutional ownership thing.

Depends on your broker. I know with TDA you have to specifically select GTC-EXT, otherwise it won’t go through till open. I forget to click that 9/10 and scratch my head for a minute every time.
ok ok, but does GTC EXT work for regular hrs aswell?
Yep. I mistyped, its actually GTC+EXT - so as the name suggests it’s Good till Cancelled plus Extended Hours - so pretty much if the market is open at all, the order will execute if triggered. There’s also Day + Ext, which would only be the day you place plus it’s extended hours.

Which strike/date/price?
220/225/230 all 12/17’s picked em up for like 2.80 average
Good picks. Hope early holiday shoppers give it a push up. Thanks for sharing. :)
PYPL is in a good spot to make a little run to earnings
Yeah. I'm holding both calls and shares and I know I'm not going to break even anytime soon, so there's that.
V? Are you a fucking boomer?
I bet you buy your SBUX with a V every day
Heh heh heh

Yeah, idk man. Im just shocked Visa is tanking like it is. Question isn’t if you should buy calls, just when.
Leaps are pretty safe....so......
I’m pretty new to visa so would you mind giving me a good idea for some leap dates/strikes?
The 225c for 1/21/22 is selling for $3.50.

I usually don't like paying a lot for theta so I try to get more long dates if I can afford it (gives me more wiggle room if I miss) but that's just my playing style. Hope this helps and good luck!
Thanks a lot. Appreciate that you took the time to write all of that. It helps having something to go off of. Good luck with your calls and whatever plays you eventually get into. Hope they print hard!
Np. You don't seem new so I'm sure you would've managed to make the right calls without my help. Thanks for your good wishing. Here's to hoping all our plays profits. :)

That's an interesting point, but I think at most they would try to be part of an existing "metaverse" and have gaming services attached. I doubt with their current focus of market & capabilities, they can switch on a dime like so.

I was flagged as a ptd and my cash has settled but I’m still unable to make trades. I knew my margin would be restricted. Why won’t they let me trade with my settled cash?
If you daytraded 3 times within a certain period, they won't let you daytrade for 3 months or something. If you daytrade the 4th time anyway they restrict you from trading at all for 3 months
Even if my cash is over 25k?
Call your broker and tell them to eat a dick

It aids in the company in raising money based on a guaranteed payout once the asset matures.

For a company that handles commercial and multi family real estate is this a bullish move?

From my limited understanding as I’ve only had 1 fucken day of education, it should be bullish as they aren’t Offering shares to raise capital direct from investors to dilute the float. Instead it seems to be a product they offer to be bought.

Wtf if the salt cap is only lifted to 72 I’m never living in a dem state again fuck this
what in the actual fuck is a salt cap... ?
State and local tax deduction cap. For example, california gives more to the fed than it receives.
It used to be the case you could deduct your state income tax from your federal income tax since your state income taxes are paying for services that the federal government pays for in low or no tax states. Trump made it so that the deduction is capped at 10k. Say someone sells an asset, can business, for 3 million, they have to pay 37% to the fed and 13.3% to california on the gains over 570k. 

And californians at the top tier pay 13.3 which when added to the 37% top federal rate (over 570k) means I’m paying basically 50% of my gains in tax. 

Republicans who oppose it are playing party politics, it shows they don’t actually care about states rights when it’s a blue state. Dems who oppose it are fomenting class warfare. It makes no sense that the supposedly states rights obsessed folks would rather have states receive more from the fed than they pay.

**Calculations Show Pfizer FY2022 Top Line 120B+, 50% Higher Than Current Guidance**

Autists, lend me your ears.  
 
Pfizers guide for 2022 is 1.7 billion doses. See slide 35. 
 >https://investors.pfizer.com/investors-overview/default.aspx
 
But if you notice, they are manufacturing 4 billion doses. That's means pfizer expects all these countries to execute the options on their contract for bi-annual boosters. This is just like the option the EU has on the contract below.

>https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/05/08/995007124/ramping-up-its-covid-response-eu-will-buy-up-to-1-8b-doses-of-pfizer-vaccine 

That means pfizers actual vaccine sales will double current guidance, and revenue will be 120B for FY2022 and beyond.    

FY2021 REVENUE = 40B (VACCINE) + 40B (OTHER) = 80B

>https://www.investopedia.com/pfizer-q3-fy2021-earnings-report-recap-5208079  
 
FY2022 REVENUE = 80B (VACCINE) + 40B (OTHER) = 120B    

It's all because the virus reinfects quickly, and repeatedly.    

>https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20211024/unvaccinated-people-likely-to-catch-covid-repeatedly 

I predicted this my DD 300 days ago, "Vaccine boosters needed bi-annually"

>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljda9r/vaccine_boosters_needed_biannually/
 
This is confirmed as the entire EU has approved 6 month boosters.

>https://abc7ny.com/holidays-covid-thanksgiving-safe-during-the/11083355/    
 
BNTX PFE are clear home runs. They are crushing all competition including Moderna. And they are going to raise guidance when these countries execute their options. Load to tits.  Jan 2024 PFE leaps.

Bald people make more grateful lovers
So do fat people and ugly people, most people like getting the better end of the trade.
If you are bald in the front you're a thinker, if you are bald in back you're a lover.  If you are bald all over you only think you're a lover.
Shorting GDRX, cause stocks can’t continue to always go up.
You’re going to get ass blasted on that one. Don’t bet against Abdiel lol
I'm going to be a footsoldier  buying CGC calls Friday. Avis style melt up on earnings.
Have you met TINA yet? She’s a nice lady and well the only option.

Lumberg fucked her
I remember when SPY went to 230 last year, now it never goes down by a couple percentage points lol

Anyone else think the 13 pro max is too big?

prolly buy PLTR puts after seeing the report that their Federal Deal volume was revised due to an error in the estimated revenue....an error of 2 decimal places!! reported estimate of $164mil, actually more like $1.64mil
I bought some

Ready for chgg to climb outta its hole
“While it is possible to calculate negative P/E ratios, they are generally not accepted by the investing community.”

I love how the investing community just ignores anything that hurts to look at
remember those pieces of paper folded up so you can put your fingers into them from middle school.

#$CAKE: Average weekly sales quarter-to-date are approximately $213,000 and off-premise average weekly sales of $60,000 are nearly double the level seen during the same period in fiscal 2019.

QQQ 399c 11/5

Only needs to go up 0.8% Thursday and Friday to hit.  Costs about 5 cents.
This earnings call is dumb bullish so far
Bought some QS at the same time Tesla was going into earnings… has paid off 🤘🏻🤘🏻
Broku Gang eating shit now
Amp token
should i go long on clov or ocgn
I did ocgn. Way too much of a dip. Already starting to rebound. $14 tomorrow
Which will have better earnings clov or ocgn?
> Clov is the better pick. It has a higher earnings growth rate, which means that it can grow its earnings faster than OCGN.
And what does it mean if the earning growth rate is lower?

Selling 45/50c 11/19
Grabbed some vix calls before close, wainting on a vix nutbust
I feel like I figured out a free money glitch, but I need more capital. 

I want to sell covered calls against a stock while also selling cash secured puts against the same stock. Both would be reasonably far OTM ( around 9-10%) to minimize risk of being assigned in either direction. 

Then, all the free money from straddling theta at both ends can be used to increase either position (more shares for CC’s or increase in cash for more puts). 

I’m already selling covered calls every week but I wanna get more of that expired theta money lol.
Wrong subreddit
Are you kidding me? Risking an assignment that locks in thousands of losses for 100 bucks doesn’t fit the description of this sub? 

Fuck up outta here.
No you’re fully covered by the underlying what you’re describing is literally called running the wheel and the favorite strategy of r/thetagang
Much higher delta to the downside than the upside. Mildly retarded strategy that would miss basically every upside surprise.
r/thetagang is that way ---->
Puts don't really need to be cash secured if you have shares for a covered call.  It takes a pretty ridiculous situation where you somehow lose your 100 shares for less value than the put needs to be covered.
Lol…it isn’t a glitch. It is a trap. You only make money if IV is high. And when IV is high you get suckered into it and end up taking capped gains or assigned. Don’t start trading just yet buddy. Do some paper trading first
not really a free money glitch, you're just taking on slightly more risk for slightly more gain than just holding.
Just do it with PLTR and you'll never get assigned.
Anyone thinking of YOLOing into OpenDoor following Zillow going bust?
They are doing the same stupid thing that killed Zillow.
Thinking the same. Zillow was just the canary imo.
Yolo puts maybe
At the $20 price point it's got a good chance of being a 2 or 3 bagger if they post good earnings

Last minute penalty against psg. I’m so sick and tired of this. My sportsbet right trough the bin. God hates me
If I am needed I will be in the Ashram centering myself 

🧘
Skillz is an absolute buy tomorrow
Thinking the same. Buying stock or calls?
I’m gonna buy some more shares to drive down my price and also execute a call. How many shares I buy will depend on the expense of the call. Made 400$ on my Ford calls from 2 days ago today and sold.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Lumn after hours looking good
Zoom out on that chart and rethink holding that company. It was trash when it was centurylink and it’s still trash now that it “rebranded”
I only care about the profits I'm getting now. Bag holders can worry about their own losses later.
Agreed, Loving the .$25 quarterly div, but dogshit for having fun with.
Yeah you don't get much money on calls but they are cheap and I'll make a decent profit tomorrow I think.
#BGFV check it out
Where can I find hot stepmoms?

So which one of us bought $net puts?
🙋‍♂️.. 180p 11/19 for $675 5x
NET will be interesting...
It’s the next Tesla (for big tech industry). Old wrinkly ball investors just don’t know it yet, it’s going to take them a little while to realize the significance of what they do
Gonna load up tomorrow if it's green again
I have some but they are to hedge my position. My cost base is like 63 or 64 a share.
Anything That Goes BER.....Turns To Shit
How do you sell naked puts when everything keeps going up?!?!!?

Y’all really gonna sleep on Cinemark (CNK)? Never hear you all mention it. They report earnings Friday morning.
Have you been to one? No thanks.
Non-meme AMC?
Even the CEO thinks it’d be ridiculous to be valued anywhere near AMC. At least he’s reasonable
UVXY weekly puts?
I will say it once again. If you buy spy 2dte calls every Wednesday. It pays off most of the time.
WISH 🚀
Puts on BIRD?

COCO why would u do that to me
DO YOU FOLLOW THE CONDUCTOR’S LEAD?
Oh bro tell me about it fuck my life
Buy OTM calls 3 years out, sit and wait patiently, hopefully you profit bigly
There are warrants for sale
Bruh.... you dont sell spy like ever
[deleted]
meh I guess not
Wtf was that at the end. Tomorrow’s gonna be mangos
it's just day traders closing out a portion of their holdings before market closes, nothing abnormal
Oh now it goes up
Idk
Finishing strong, they know what the media is gonna do tonight , smart
Dee Cee DoubleU Ay W

The warrants get you more leverage
You know that thing could open at 100 tomorrow. It's barely hit the media.
Why did I get down voted for mentioning Crocs :(
5000 here we come
IV super low too
#PENISES DOWN 🍆
SPY, Ford and Orange Man, thanks for the tendies today
Can't stay flat forever
Another week of making all the wrong moves
Lol at the FOMO in the last minute
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Is TSLA going to dump at 4:00.001PM EST?
New ATHs on S&amp;P500 confirmed there in the last minutes.  SPY is close.
Taking a shit while the market closes. Name a more iconic bowel movement.
Spy, stop, you’re scaring me 😥 but also making me fkin rich
oil prices went up and idiots around the world are blaming their own respective governments.
Can I get a "Let's Go Brandon" for $100?
Wait until your brokerage auto liquidate your entire account.
NVDA and SQ can have a hot supper tonight.

CHWY and DKNG, got get your fuckin pillows. You're sleeping outside.
&gt; it's a fucking bank
Let’s Go!!!
Tattoo TQQQ on my face please
praying to jack ma tonight that my calls print
Paypal has to be an over reaction right? It's fucking paypal...
what a weak eod for TSLA
Got 10, you never know.
That's absolutely true. Once the maga boys get word this things going to Neptune
If you're not buying VIAC then what are you even doing with your life.
I'm a pure bred American and I support SPY 500 by buying every share I can.
[deleted]
Why not calls on manufacturers... if the start pumping out that's the only way used prices are going down. 

**car salesman**
Hey now why line go bad way 😠
Fuck hold or sell spy
VIAC GOING CRAZY.... News AH?
That 20 cent drop it just went on set my calls back to what they were at open
Lies
Not all-in but picked up a handful on the dip earlier.
it's almost impossible to predict. id guess it will go up more given enormous volume, but don't bet your future on it
**This is going to be hugeeee 🥭 them options are going to be the move**
SPY/SPX literally charging to ATHs in the final minutes here, wow.
I was here for the great bagholder creation of 10/21/21
I’m sure congress will have a meeting about his new social media and I’m sure Apple will ban it from the App Store. America still gonna win though I’m not worried
Haha, SPY go BRRR
🐭 calls printing 🤑
lord have mercy imma bout ta bust!
At this point, fuck yes. You see how fast the value was rising? Well before the jump too. Holding
Can I buy oranges after hours?
Used just seems like a terrible idea right now, at least anecdotally while shopping around. There are 20 year old trucks that cost maybe a few thousand less than a brand new one of the same class. I have no idea why anyone would pay that premium on such a shit box old vehicle. lmao.
Wait
At least this time INTC didn't leak their earnings 10 mins before close.
Hulk dick is here right now
I almost feel bad for the 80k weekly puts guy.
This market is batshit crazy
This is some kind of sick fucking joke
Are we not allowed to mention that one stock anymore?
lol Fagman i love it
Get some HCA calls bois
Where have you been? LOL.

That's what the SPAC kids including myself have been doing all of LAST year...until the SPAC-pocalyse of THIS year. It works until it doesn't...

Most SPAC companies are absolute CRAP without products, or they lie about their pipeline, and most are not even worth $10...LOL. The market has since woken up from this.

This 'SPAC' would have most likely died and ended up in the SPAC graveyard like the others if it wasn't for a particular political figure being attached to it.

I miss the good ol' SPAC days...
Mango colored lambo
Let's go SNAP
AHHH STOP DUMPING U CHEETO FUCK!!!
RIOT if you gimme back my 300 bucks
Fngu
SPY thinks it's the open.  Nobody say anything!
It opens at the price tomorrow
There is, calling out those ppl. 

I don't quite follow the sudden 1B to 1.5B move.
Carvana
Same. You holdin?
-100000000000000%
The serotonin will hit all the same
Nice 125% day, now I'm just down 89% all time.
Honest opinions pls , I opened trump stock short at 41$. Do I close it at loss now or wait till tomorrow ?
hoping hulk's dick makes an appearance
Bought QQQ 2DTE 378 calls yesterday and held through those dips. Tomorrow… 0DTE. Until Valhalla brothers
I told y’all QCOM was about to make another move up earlier. 

Volume seldom lies.
TQQQ
Balls deep in semiconductors RN
Just shoot up anyway. Then nothing matters.
How do I keep playing options with potential for big gains with less risk. 

Stocks are lame as fuck, even though I own a lot it doesn’t give me any gratifications when they go up
Only bears lose money this week ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Guys what are the odds SPY closes at 445 by 10/25 😂😂😂😭😭😭
Also interesting to see my value go green 10 mins before the stock moved. They bought the calls and loaded up
$250 in a week
AMZN is gonna blow off the top
What's the best ETF to buy if I just want those sweet FAANG/FAGMAN gains at 3x?  Something stronger than QQQ.....
Buy the rumor sell the news 10x on this one
BERS R FUK
Tomorrow is going to be the greenest day we’ve seen in months or an absolute bloodbath if only I could figure out which it’s gonna be
Did it really though?
Friend
here's the final prayers for my SNAP calls, prayers
Definitely sell on deep red days and buy on bright green ones. That’s absolutely how to make money in the market
We are breaking ATH before close without a doubt
SPYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Better open at 460 or my 456s gonna be worthless
Algos say it's ath time
and it fucking works. I own about 1800 shares worth of options in MU
spacetti and meatballs, delicious dish
Hearing the word angus makes me want to yak.
Suckenburg, “Shit, he is actually fucking coming after us to take our market share, fuck”.
FYI amds earnings price action is today

They moon on intel earnings day. Because intel sucks and basically confirms market share is eroding. 

Now is the time you want amd calls. Not during it’s actual earnings day when it’s Brie Larson ass flat.
[deleted]
Was down 60% on my FB $342.50 weeklies, now up 12%.... what a turn of events
i am not a regular, so i wasn't even aware we couldn't talk about the TRUTH
Haha, mods are not idiots.
You could also go long on automakers. It depends on your rational for why used car prices are going to go down (i.e. why you think demand would slow). Do you think it’s because an increase of supply of new cars in the future will make used less appealing?
Shoutout to all the assclowns that talked shit for buying BNTX calls. enjoy your ramen
SNAP IV at 170% lel
Waiting for both SPY and TESLA to shoot up
In for 2 contracts as a goof. I hope I regret not buying more.
Calling him Daddy makes my skin crawl.
Those are arms bruh
Your lips to dog's ears buddy
I can’t watch any of it. But I like money.
LFG $T LFGOOOO
Must of edited it, cause originally it was show 5 mil diff
Trump's new company is supposedly going the SPAC route. Can't wait to buy puts.
PayPal calls next week
I did not. You should be banned rn
Calls*
🥭: Best social media on the internet👌 Believe me 🙌 tremendous 👍
These 🥭 comments brings me back to the old WSB that I liked.
I hope so. Negative overreaction on NUE earnings today.
You just described Jpows regular Wednesday.
Sitting on 250 shares now. Started buying yesterday
Good sign out of Tesla to hold this price. Should see another nice jump for momentum to carry it above ATH.
Black sky cum in my eye
Calls.
Sold some orange stock and paid off a years of losses. Still holding some for tomorrow though. This gonna be YUGE
Oh dang the condo has an inversion table in the gym. Didn’t think about using it. Came back to Orlando today. Thanks buddy
It's the white paste you put on drywall
Wild Bill Duckcock
Going balls deep in 455c y not
45's actual valuation was always hard to pin down since the majority of it isn't in stocks.

How do you calculate the worth of the Trump brand? (Cuz that's what he is, a real estate brand) Especially after he's been president?
These are dirt cheap end of day so I’m trying it.  11/5 270s for 1.37
Up 35% on my ARKK puts that expire tomorrow. Holding 💪🏻.
I have 455c for next Friday, I think I’m going to hold them overnight. I hate doing it and probably we’ll be big red tomorrow because I know the market secretly revolves around me but I think I’m gonna

Probably will for a while but it will get out. Just need Boomers to get word

Tsla has still got legs 💪💪💪
First rule of wsb;

speak in tongues on low caps
More so Hannity,Tucker's a little more right than Hannity even
SPY gonna hit ATH tomorrow then do coke and party with strippers all weekend before having a really shitty Monday.
Lmao nah we’ll have a +4-5% day tomorrow

CLF
Imagine not believing in 🟧 SAD! Can’t wait to order my lambo tomorrow, I know what color I’m getting.
Last chance to get on CLF train. Earnings premarket tomorrow.  
  
$CLF 9/29 22c  
  
  
  
Buy CLF cornsuckers
My nightly prayer
7 minutes of pure fomo, then fomo at open
Yeah, I'm waiting for the fake chip shortage to end and then that seems like the play, or maybe iron condors since inflation.
Sold SPY 454c two weeks ago thinking we would never get back to ATH. 

🤡
TELL managed to do the worst drop of the day in my watchboard, trying to get to -5%
Tryna buy puts on 🥭 stonk
Oh damn I wonder if the media will try to stifle it? It involves money not politics so probably not
CLOV gets cucked once again 😒
Love Love Love
You should get a free pass when it’s the presidents spac. Let’s go Brandon !
Running off with who? My wife?
is the intc puts guy doing okay
Do your thing daddy Elon
SPY just wants a little foreplay before it thrusts right through ATH
$45k made on 45th presidents stock. What a fucking day 🙌🏼 all proceeds will go into $SOFI on the next dip, if there is one!
No one is selling shares. Trying to buy more but every time I do it goes up again
Rather see SPY fuken die than seeing this bitch trade with low volume. Fuken full ass BEARISH FLAG. Honestly, if you are not seeing this then idk what to tell you.
$CLF 10/29 22c
My boss is going to fire me soon
There's a front page post today about a guy who made $500k on the market, and this year pissed away the majority of it on TSM calls.

He was YOLOing hundreds of thousands of dollars on short term options and it was the bulk of his entire worth.

I mean... that's one of the few things left that makes WSB great. But I feel like that 500k was wasted on that individual. Give me the 500k next time.
AMD playing with my emotions. Go to $125 you bastard. Lol

Qqq calls then
I bet ATH tomorrow before the weekend.
NASDAQ moving higher even with the 10-Year yield raging.

Who will out themselves as the fraud tomorrow?

You guys like money. Eww. Social justice helps pay my bills. Who needs the stock market.

Anyone holding tesla puts overnight?  😬
Visualmod you don't know *me*
is anyone going all in on snap options?
Last chance to get on $CLF, cornsucker
Orange you fomoing at the mouth? People will after Tucker and Hannity get ahold of this!
It’s tech earnings season easy money
Funny way to spell gambling
I guess they have a ways to go on the upside before coming back down, I should just wait a while.
A t e r
Go to r/spac and see how it’s working for them
Its going back to $875, gwt out while you can.
Much sour hour, wow
LOL
 FB going up. The only tech stock that's been hit hard. I have options exp April 22 and it's gonna moon. Don't sleep on fb.
EAR poppin🚀🚀🚀🙏🏻
This fucking roomba full of sass
same here, and then later i will complain.. i have so much work to do when its time to play with the family.

It's a miracle. My $342.50 FB weeklies went green. Someone's buying these up
Gonna break 50 before close
🥭 and 🚀.  Miss being able to use those two symbols together here regularly.

Depends on the size. If it’s like a regular steamed boa size than it’s personal unless your a good friend.
So, mango to 70 or 20 tomorrow?
This pig is gonna get slaughtered, or get rich trying
I wish I was in a gang. I never know what to do with my hands when taking pictures

I’ve been doing that since 17 ffs - when’s it gonna rise again
If you sell  🥭 before close you a lil bitch
How did you lose on $SPY? What was the expiration and strike?
I heard a lot of rental companies sold their cars when the pandemic hit, and now throw in a chip shortage so car manufacturers are slowing down and people’s desires to drive instead of fly and you got yourself a stew.

Of course that could be bullshit, but trying to rent a car this summer was a nightmare.
I have some sick affliction where I only buy into companies that regularly receive bad press and shitty news. As you might expect, I play a lot of FB, TSLA, and BA.
RSI on SPY broken.
Hmmm, I have a sneaking suspicion that my $30 Nov AVIR calls are fucked.
so nervous for AMD
Take me to the promised land in AH mango man 🥭

**Earnings Season**

12:00 - Well I can’t work now it’s the lunch time dip. 

1:00 - Well I can’t work now, the dip is over. 

2:00 - Well I can’t work now, companies reporting AH having midday spike/dump. 

3:00 - Well I can’t work now it’s power hour. 

4:00 -  Well I can’t work now AH just started!
Of course not.  I'm holding BABA calls.
pumps like that are ridiculous. The movements are so fast and random, very hard to time.
None but I hope it goes down just because of its ad revenue. Shit pops up ads every 5 seconds when watching anything on the spotlight page. Watch time will lower people don’t want interruption every second
Tomorrow feels like a red day but I’m too pussy to buy Puts
rough day for gme and amc
Sell, wait for the shit show that will happen when options come out and possibly rebuy.
by being up 2%?
[deleted]
It’s a 🥭 spac. You shouldn’t block that.
Fuck you PYPL
Every time I think I'm the world's most retarded trader I think about WSB loss porn to make myself feel better. Holding 10x $454c into tomorrow
&gt; There's at least 4 years left.
Doesn't happen often, but sometimes trades just go your way all day. First 40k+ day in ages, back to a less embarrassing amount in my account.

Couple more days like these and maybe I'll be positive for the year 😅
Buy high and sell low is my way  fighting inflation
I’m about a half a percent off my all time high. Hopefully tomorrow
CROX having a mad day. Closed at 135 last night, its highest today was 154. Currently at 148
Sooo ready for the BABA rip tomorrow.
Tsla running off again tomorrow
I'm going to do a lot of stupid shit this weekend. Thank you Don, very cool.

Rental cars ordinarily struggle to make a little money off their fleets before liquidating them at a 30% loss.  This year their 12,000 mile last-year's Honda Civic is selling at a premium to list to people who want to buy a car, because cars aren't available on dealer lots.

Airplanes aren't like that.  No one wants to buy an airplane right now.
Bruh KO options are weird… 11/12 options are cheaper than 11/5..??

Edit: oh must be dividends
Do you think there is more than 1 year of Bool left? Maybe 2?
Now. Going up once word gets out. Haven’t even seen anything on CNBC
I'm getting off Mr. 🥭's wild ride now
If you have a contract, there is at least one open interest.

can't wait for donnie pump's spac to meme him into being an actual billionaire again
Lol a mod and his bot.
Wait isn’t 12 like the strike price like on an options contract?
Sold my PYPL puts too early - fuck!
Fidelity is not built around trading options. I find it frustrating.   TOS is built for options first.
Because what few cars they are renting are like $500/day.
Fingers crossed that Tesla passes 900 tomorrow. 🥺
Market been had a raging boner for 2 weeks non stop now. Bears have been ethnically cleansed bro ☠️ 🐻
Sorry I won't talk about it anymore
might be eod
Probably true
Profits sky high, P/E crazy low, demand through the roof with future demand from autos and infrastructure also promising and the price keeps dropping. Hoping that CLF earnings in the morning will kick off a jump in steel cos.
I've come full circle through pure capitalism.

Go, Orange Man Media, go.
not at all. People still travel way less. And the semi shortage ameans car prices and thus second hand and rentals are going up up up.
Yeah I don't want to short those guys directly because they are making bank on the volume, and I believe in their model.
KEK
Palintard literally just wiped out all of my gains for today
Chip shortage? People renting cars instead of buying them?
Awfully quiet on the wish front today. I should have sold yesterday?
&gt; I don’t need anything. I have a lot of money to buy things with
I did that 10 years ago, am I Enlightened yet?
Oh it’s manipulated, not always or the way people think but yes they have the means to make your options expire worthless come opex and to suggest they don’t do it is crazy
Instead of using a picture of him why not just get some gullible reactionary flair? Same shit
AMD doin the spooky dance but I'm not falling for it hodl.
this thing reeks of a pump and dump. But when is the dump? who knows?
&gt; I'll just have to call them "the poor"
Puts on KMX and AN and shit like that?
You don’t have to sell 100% of your shares u know? I’d take some profits and buy yourself something nice.
Buy again around 290
My ban bet is 65 by tmrw lol 🤞
AMD you know you want to hit $125.....
no - think about the increase in local commuting.
&gt; I would like to make a trade with you.
We block low cap and SPAC plays to not anger the powers that be and give them a reason to take us down. There isn't much we can do about people using common words as replacements though.
Must be your first time trading a 🥭 stock. The last stock 🥭 pumped was kodak and it went from 2 to the peak of 60.
Dang, Portillos even ships their sandwiches and hotdogs.  Just ordered an 8 sandwich Italian beef meal with gravy and Hot giardiniera.  Mmmmmm......
Lol “properly functioning brain”
Warrants, not shares. Warrants are currently down to 11.
Please sir. Could you spare a couple puts?
unclear how this would affect me, or anything in my portfolio?
bruh, IV so high right na
Puts on KMX, the biggest used care dealer?

Is the mango getting more ripe tomorrow or should I pick it now?
someone enlighten me WHY THE FUCK are rental cars ($CAR) up 500%+ since pandemic and over 100% their all time highs, whereas shit like Airlines and Boeing are struggling to even meet their pre pandemic price. aren't those two correlated?

thanks for the civilized responses guys
Literally called it out of left feild
My fellow republicans
Bought the top too huh?
SNAP, put or call
If it’s the T man, I’d sell that shit. We had an abnormally large run up today.
I don’t *feel* safe
Damn rip. Haven’t been fishing in awhile but I’m sure I’ll get wrecked when I go for my winter trip. Guess you gotta sell your catch now for an ROI 😂
Spy double top confirmed
Maybe maybe not. I just know I need a green day tomorrow. Stupid day trade rule.
Holy shit I forgot I had AMD
Is oil still the play this season?
Imagine thinking the time to enter spy calls for the first time is when it’s basically at all time highs.

Wasn't sure whether to buy shares, units or warrants. Bought stock at 4 am, watched it drop twenty percent. Said fuck it went back to sleep. Woke up when the market opened - up ten percent - sold most of it on the slight dip, cause im a bitch. Then watched it moon 350 extra percent.

Its better than losing money but man watching things moon after you sell is hard too.
you might be right. I suspect the market is being manipulated as well, the price action around OPEX days is just a little too coincidental...
The dick you cut might be your own. -Confusionus
Lol why do people always speculate on this? You realize the bulk of these ceos don’t have money UNLESS they sell shares right?

If INTC shits itself today then we are going higher

Yep

I had the radio on for no good reason today and heard a horrible commercial for that thing. It seems it's been here since half of september.

full disclosure: my 4y/o said he wanted the tv to play music, background noises calms him.
I think you’re safe.
Is it worth ending a friendship over?
Apple branded cleaning cloth shortage is the reason everyone should be buying calls on AAPL. They can sell a cleaning cloth for $19.
Gotta make your own flys
It's somewhat valid. The issue is that it may float around $10 for a long period of time while other stocks are growing. Limited downside sure but FOMO can kick in.
Sell or hold?
RSKD $30 calls 🤑
I will say again: SNAP is soft core OnlyFans. You ever see their featured profiles? All babes showing all but lips and nips. You can send them GIFTS that cost real money. There’s so many simps in the world that I highly doubt they don’t blownearnings out of the water. Not to mention as revenue on every company’s story. 10sec snap follow by a 20sec commercial, some unskippable. I believe in this stock, gonna be $100+ by next quarters end.
Doesn't seem like it. As of now most of the contagion should stay in china
Sell at market
I sold it. A little too early, but I can’t be mad at profits.
Going to get banned again? Literally just follow format lol Banbet! then it’s put what you want to bet with the timeframe. You should be banned for doing it this way

do you mean no bid? you're kinda fucked if no one wants to buy it. can ask your broker to put a do not exercise on it, but that just means it will expire worthless

PYPL has a tendency to move 10 dollars in 2 days, it's done it multiple times over the past couple of months. You should be able to make it out without much damage or even profit.

No
Glad I grabbed mango warrants at 12 like a dumbass.

The more of you bitching about PYPL make me even happier I bought these Jan &amp; Mar $280c
Do the math. Kid takes nine months to develop, which is while the guy was dating said ex.
You’re not a multi billion dollar fund manager with the means to pull that off by buying those calls day in and out or having a proxy do it for you. She goes on tv it’s a bit different…
Crazy day but a boring af “power hour.”
What's happening with all these "What's happening with X" posts?

Yeah, these guys gotta brush up on the rules.
How do you close an option position if there’s no open interest?

i bought when MU was around $80 ... so I need it to bounce back HARDER
why did i  buy BABA calls this week
lol AAPL is green again after that cliff dive
Hooked up to an iron butt right.
I wrote a long post about why I dropped PayPal, as a business owner, after they upped their prices. Many others felt the same.

I agree 100%. I’m honestly about to buy a bookshelf copy even though I’ve read it. Phenomenal story. Best thing I was ever forced to read.

And that quote is *perfect* for this subreddit. So much of the book is, honestly.
What's SPY's closing ATH?
SPY puts are tempting, but i know as soon as i buy them tomorrow green will be confirmed!
How come BB volume is so much lower today?
My Spy puts I bought yesterday are fuck. But my portfolio is green today.   I don’t know how to feel
Made almost $50 for my (4 hour) lunch shift today. Pretty damn good.
Buy calls at least 2 months out and you'd be good. 5-10 percent out of the money
$wti oil up 12% this week, sold before that shit goes back down, no diamonds on this one. still holding wish and sdc tho
I think you can check with

!banbet status
Su Bae up 15% in 2 weeks. 

It's going dump next week even after it beats.
Bought it yesterday and today… added some calls today as well

Read the rules guys. Don't name that stock until it hits 90
she's made a whole bunch of price targets on Tesla, it's not surprising that some of them came true. Throw enough darts you'll hit something. Predicting that something went up a crazy amount might go up a bunch more is not that amazing.
my monthly pay didn't go up, for a while now, seems I need to have a talk soon

On Fidelity you have to click the position, press trade, choose sell to close, input number of contracts, and it automatically starts off with market order highlighted. So technically not much different but sometimes the 5-10 seconds it takes to do that matters

Did a marketing plan for Portillos in my business class couple years back. Bullish!
Much worse than that.

in februari, this was discussed, it would be disastrous. Also impossible, the stock market is a zero sum game (to some extend, there are some exceptions) in order for the entire market to pull out some of the market needs to buy in. Same on the buying the one stock, there needs to be willing sellers.
that was me at a 200% run and look where it got me

Holy shit has fly fishing gear gotten expensive
What is the reason that some stocks end up not being able to be discussed? Thought this was a speculative ape house.
If you use TOS you can do what you just described in four taps.
Basically hate every one at work right now

Don’t buy it, it’ll just go down more. It’s what happened to me.
*Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning—-*

*So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.*
I know. Felt the same but it will keep going. Only 35 million shares right now too. I’ve said that so many times then miss out so not going to this time. The monthly new users will be insane, like him or not
Yeah but then you have to inverse your inverse.  It's inverses all the way down

You don’t find it strange that Cathie predicted the EXACT ridiculous price target 18 months ago? And then exactly that happened? There are a lot of connections that point to what made that occur

How is this related and if the yolo is puts then sure
So is evergrande priced in?

Any calls on spy are mad cheap which mames me sus
Lost 10 in puts before closing them out early today to cut some losses. Switched to calls soon after and got a little of it back thus far
Market cap wise I think there’s a lot of room but I can’t bring myself to buy a 365% run

Thinking about the time I went to a planetarium and someone booed when they showed earth
No volume on that shit. Get net, nvda and amd to the moon!!
Now. I’m Buying more. Half the country voted for the guy and people are pissed. Taliban have a Twitter account but he doesn’t, that’s what I always hear from them. I’m not political I just want to make money
Buy an excessive amount of OTM calls and it forces market makers to hedge by buying the shares just in case, thus forcing more buying thus forcing more calls to be bought, creates a feedback loop
I always felt orange and green fit quite nicely together.
Fuck it lets go
Volume drying out on 🥭
So is the cheat code to life to just find SPACs that are locked at $10 for months, buy shares and then sell when they eventually pop? There are literally hundreds of these right now and they barely show any sub $10 downside
I’m getting banned on Monday.
Huuge move, tremendous!!!

TSLA is one giant bull flag
You sold early
For a reason
&gt; I had to take my money out of crypto because it's all bullshit.
$T 26c- $CLF 22C- $SPY 449p that's all folks
they just keep printing!!!!@
I can’t prove it but it is well considered to be true. The volume is not natural over the course of the past 18 months. Large funds can do that to force it up. It’s not a conspiracy like the GME nonsense
The price action on TSLA the last 10 minutes of the day is going to be epic.
Let me buy so it can dump

Closing on ATH with low volume. Even SPY volume is less than yesterday. Bearish.
Let’s see if we can get another ‘halt’ in the last 30 minutes.
GME rocking that negative beta again.
So they weigh 172 pounds each?
The bottom, bet they knock earnings out of the park, going to buy Jan $280 and Mar $300 calls
oh fuck you're right, good call i forgot about rh gold
Fucking balls on the guy ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Ok, just another 15% and I’m back to where I started 2021. Let’s get this bread!
Could you maybe explain this one a little
Calls on cake shakes
Honestly SPY should be at $460 without evergrand screwing it all up. Calls all day
I played that game this week and lost far too my. Doubled down on calls
if my hearts racing out of euphoria gains I sell that shit. 
$453c 10/22 thank you for blessing me.

Good luck to whoever bought em
if you held nflx calls through earnings tou should be near break even now. incredible
Fidelity should have an “auto sell” button on the positions page where you can just click it and it automatically sells the entire position on a market order
When should I buy the 🥭stock ?
It will be up in some months for sure
I went a little further out to 10/27 and got $460s for .16 a piece
😂😂😂
Amd calls up 40%... Expiration March 2022 😂😂😂😂
It looks like the ticker was being banned earlier, idk. Looks okay now 🥭
meh you can't prove that. All the GMEtards thought itwas short squeezing, until investigation revealed it was just a pump like everything else.
I need SPY 460 next week or I'm also ruined though
I'm gonna need the markets to close so BA can hold this 214 line.
**🥭man’s stock options when they open are going to go wild**

I’m scared to see what this Pepsi-co partnership yields. Hard Mountain Dew doesn’t sound like my cup of tea, but I can see shit like that catching on. Who’d have thunk, hard soft drinks…
Massively overvalued, dying industry, dilution keeping them alive, minimum upside as nobody with a brain will buy and hold at these prices. 

Are you wearing a helmet?
Oooof.
#$2 460c 10/22 can make $200+ 😂

Can't wait for options, and Nancy's Hubby YOLO's PUTs and loses it all.
Over $14
60
Can we get another one of these runners again tomorrow?
I think they’re oversold since the seltzer / pandemic home drinking hype has died down. I’m a beer industry guy, so my hubris is getting the better of me for this play, but I think I’m right 🤞🏼

I bought some OTM calls for December. Already more than doubled, waiting for tomorrow to take profits.
Earnings are gonna be sickening, and outlook with NFTs incoming.... yowza

Which one of you apes bought the high in tesla at precisely $900.00. It had to be someone here.
I wish I could go back in time and tell my dad what stocks and options to buy and make us rich so I could live in a mansion and have sex all day and eat french fries. Anyone else?
Gonna laugh if Scion/Burry bet against them when the 13Fs come out
Wow iam getting gaped pretty hard rn.🐻

Nice, nice. I'm looking to put maybe 25k USD in total but I could be convinced to buy more depending on news.
Does anybody have any designated songs they listen to when watching the market ?
MSFT making my portfolio green for the month 📈📈

Why we mooning?
Where the fuck is bb with the ting goes scraaat
Threw a grand market order.... robinhood!!! Make media great

Thats how retarded I am
TSM can we be at 120 next week
Pypl calls at close?
yep, you have the sleeping giant thing where they pressure advertisers, you also have the media doing a full court press on any news, you have the whistleblowers, the expose's, you probably even have adversaries vindictive enough to apply to work there just to sabotage it. risky, very risky.
Always happens to me as well...but profits are profits.

Worse is when I set a stop  loss and it never drops under the price I entered.
I'm too drunk to check: Did SPX break resistance today or might it still get rejected by close?
Whoever bought spy puts because it's October is foolish
Spy 460C exp tomorrow still cheap and will print
Can you provide a reason why the fed needs to be pumping 120b into the financial market at the moment? If you provide a reason, sure I’ll explain qe to you.
The closest amalgam is Japan in the early 1990s. I recall our stonk markets were worried for a couple weeks but it didn't affect our economy much. I still think it's mostly Chinese owing money to other Chinese.
Not really, but SPX options are better tax efficiency anyway
I am le over-leveraged.

Nancy pelosi’s calls are printing bigly.
Predictions on where the 🥭spac will open tomorrow?
&gt; I did.
Yea I figure PYPL is solid and this reaction is strange so I'm happy to pick some up. We also aren't talking a ton of shares. Maybe 100 total eventually.
LOST TOO MUCH MOENY ON PYPL FUCK
Good luck dog. I just made 70% so I’ll take it
Portillos ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Thanks for the serious answer my dude. $150k is my salary goal so I appreciate it.
Anyone else buy mangos at the top today? C'mon gang, I know y'all lurking here
You have any BABA calls you can sell?
TSLA bust through $900 and I’ll never touch myself again
Prestige worldwide
IMO this is a pause, I think this will double at least. MM are not going to make this crash. This something else. like a gamestop. This will make history. i believe this is only the begining
Oh, legit and serious company, overpriced though
I bought yang calls good move or no?
Yeah, you can’t discuss SPACS here
Only monthly options… wtf!? Was going to sell a couple puts for fun…

They’ve gotten cut down and already announced they fucked up with their hard seltzer estimates. Might buy some March calls tomorrow
the market cap was lower than WSB allowable so I'm not writing the ticker since I've been banned for that before
a lot of GME shills were screeching because I sold my FD calls at $189-$190. the calls have 1/5  in value since lol
COCO on the path to $25 just a little early dip!!
Yep
You must be an asshole who spends 6 hours on a job that could take you half the time

I said earlier that we might hit 457.5 tomorrow!
Idk but I bought baba 200 calls 10/29 exp. I think this might be the one guys…… or not 🤡
Damn AMD abd MSFT rippin
To da moon
beats me
Never too late to be a bag holding
if we did that tomorrow the $1875 I spent on 150 10/22 456c's would turn into $60k lol no way I actually get a big win, sorry fellas
Coincidentally, a word from Powell.  

Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that "these tough new rules raise the bar high in order to assure the public we serve that all of our senior officials maintain a single-minded focus on the public mission of the Federal Reserve."
Am I the only one buying $YANG calls right now?
Could go up, could go down
i guess palantir staying flat all week is better than -20% like every other week
No frens, it is just beginning. He could make a fucking IRC channel and it would be worth more than a B.

QCOM shrek dick, wat happened there
The thrill of the spy call is unmatched
what is DWACW? Warrants?
cheap af right now
I'm most likely shorting /ES right before close tomorrow. I knew today wasn't the day to do it. I bought YANG calls on my for fun RH account , could see 3-4x gains.
Bears😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Saw some screenshots. It looks like Twitter beta and you can’t say anything to hurt their feelings

SPY gamma squeeeze
SPY 460 next week or tomorrow if we have a really good day.
been too nervous to join the trump stock.. is it too late?
Ye
Were you expecting something different
maybe that why this one stayed
Would be surprised if SNAP ended in a Theta win
Lmao really just my luck 🤣🤣 when I sell my spy calls to just take profit cause it seemed like it wasn't really doing anything. Immediately the next candle it rockets. Well you're welcome guys
Really think the commercial real estate issue in China is being overlooked by western investors and not priced in. Evergrande is just the recognizable name. There's more than a dozen firms like them deep in the hole. 

China is vital to global supply chain and low manufacturing prices. You bet your ass any turbulence there will trickle here too. Tack on 7 consecutive green SPY days and possibility for medicore earnings? I'm going 🌈 🐻
Good play. Earnings on 11/07
455 calls are giving me the GOOD succ, not the bad one somehow
IBKR are the margin bros
Bigly!
neh, don't feel it at all.

Currently feel like Syrian Shawarma, in pita bread
I sold my Spy calls two hours ago. This hurts
Wat da Tesla doin?
people in denial lmao - who tf things it'll go below $800 next week. That's just insane
I'm surprised my klic play is actually working out
AMD
I still don't know why it dipped in the first place
lol how great would it be if the UI is all orange, just absolutely offensive to the human eye
Algorithms saw this and pumped
i feel obligated to buy a MAGA hat now
AMD
Let’s go $spy hit 460

AAPL 150 0dte or will I get burned again
NFLX just hit ATH 

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk
Should I sell 100 $57.5c for Intel and make a quick 7500?
Tesla just give us $900. Please
Exactly. This shit is DoA. No companies besides shit like My Pillow will advertise on there. A subscription model on a social media site is retarded. Best he can do is beg his MAGA Tards for donations like a Hillbilly Patreon.
Apple .05% green, is this what it feels like to be rich
Bought 22k pounds worth of shares and have just as much for tomorrow if it goes even lower. 😜
I think $SKLZ found its bottom finally.
That's insinuating that saying "ruhtarded" will get you banned for 12 hours like Twitter did to me. I think they'll be more liberal than that.
The market always runs higher while CNBC has these boring segments
Sometimes i think to myself im just gonna ride fomo for the day and re enter my positions later in the day with some profit. Worked today.
Don’t short coin
Whatever firm is holding the line at $890 for TSLA is just doing it to cuck all the 900c buyers tomorrow
that bottom was obvious today, honestly
Haha.
Influencer already minting their own digital coins and dumping on their followers. 🥭 is late to the party. Lots of influencer literally became millionaires this year from spending 5 secs to copy+paste code and minting a useless digital coin.

Go for long, will not hurt… for sure it will be going back to 300
I guess it was just a matter of time. Insane market.
That was funny.lol
Now that TSLA is over what’s the earnings yolo next week?
Holy shit SPY ATH
New Co. gets listed and WSB buys in after triple digit % pump:

*This is just the beginning! So much room for growth!*

New Co. share price falls 50% a week later. 

*FUCKING ELL; this shit is garbage!*

👍
Holy fuck i am cumming tomorrow
Just scalped spy for 8 bucks.
453 has been breached 🤑
new ATH today i feel it
No joke, D W A C’s investor deck is the worst I’ve ever seen. It’s got like 15 slides and no financial projections. Going to $60 guaranteed
If your not in TSLA rn then fuck off
the penny stock version of NET is Limelight. Meme it
Sold some SNAP straddles.  Here’s to some flatness 🥂
Opened a short in the orange twitter, let’s see if I make it out alive tomorrow
AMZN and MARA FDs loaded for tomorrow

SNAP calls also loaded for earnings. Please stonk god watch over me 🙏🏼
KEEP GOING SPY

Yep.  Sadly, this nation WILL fall from within...  :-(

yep for the second time today. I have 150 10/22 456c's at a cost of 0.1275 ... I either lose $1900 or we bust thru ATH tomorrow and I make $15k for every dollar over 456 lol so we probably dumping tomorrow

My BIL did mechanical engineering. He now works in a managerial position at BASF earning roughly 150k give or take 10-15k.

You're getting the salary that he got 10-12 years ago at a smaller company...he got to where he is now by job hopping from a smaller company to Dupont to BASF and then to another BASF site...which required 2 relocations and more job duties.

Take that as you will.

Totally. Remember the Parlor mess? There’s going to be some insane posts that show up in the news and they’ll get blocked by Apple, Google, etc. People will be vomiting censorship callouts left and right.

Not to mention the fact that advertisers wouldn’t touch it with your girlfriends dick.
Nah, it's in peak-mania mode. Won't last much longer.

11 option plays today.  10 red that I thought through and really felt good about that are down $600 so far with a potential for another $400 before stop loss kicks in.  1 green that I jumped into and sold for a quick $400 in a 10 minute scalp.  

Sounds about right.
Might have been the most infuriating day to get to where your at but I’m glad your pushing 453 now

Evergreen fucked the shipping industry, Evergrande fucked China, who's the next Ever* to fuck something?
Rumors come up all the time.
Thank you SPY!  As of right now, every single one of my positions is green!
It’s been about a month since I’ve picked the right move. Idk what’s wrong with me

either its shrek green dicks, or its a dump. so many people on here do not believe in anywhere in the middle.
That was dumb af. You deserve to lose. For your health, I hope you dont.

i dont think people are pricing in the armies of lawyers, activists, organisations, interests and groups who have Don Pump firmly in their sights, the adversity this venture will face will be enormous.
Ah just like my algebra class back in the day, or when I learned geometry using a watermelon
its working!
Now to guess where everyone puts their Daddy Wants A Covfefe profits when this pump is over
Lol. The market won’t stop.
perhaps not
It's a good thing, it means you're making money, unlike 99% of this sub.

Holy shit why are SNAP options so expensive?
Done all that, and well in the middle class. Still annoying.
Dunno I am buying shares, my brokers don’t even offer options

Square has been trading in this range for the past year or so. Pypl has dropped like 10% in 2 days due to potential acquisition of pinterest news.
!banbet BITO $42.69 1w
QE isnt bad contrary to what most of reddit thinks and who cares about insider trading that seems like small peanuts. If no Fed who will set monetary policy? The monkeys in Congress? Seriously i am unsure how you think that would go
Sooo glad they’re not available yet.  I may have done something I would’ve regretted.
We are going to make social media great again!

I'm a mechanical engineer with 9 years of experience and after 5 years I think I was around 85k. 

I do live in high cost of living area, but it seems like you should be getting paid more.
is evergrande just priced in or something
I said it was going to meme when the news was announced last night , so I bought 1k shares pre-market at 12.2x and the insane selling pressure dropped it to 10.40 , so I bought another 1k at 10.50 just to closed it out for 10.65 at a loss.... I thought the meme magic was over since there was so much selling pressure and there was no one talking about 🥭 on this sub. I missed out on 80k but oh well.
5 days from now AMD bulls and TSLA bears will be dancing
DON'T COME OVER, PISS ON MY GATE

Dragon Country’s EVERGRANDE....As Nikkei notes, the company is fast running out of cash and had hoped to get past the latest crisis by selling assets, attracting investors and boosting sales. It is failing on all three counts and has missed payments to banks, retail creditors, contractors, bondholders and suppliers, which has led to the suspension of more than half of its 800 ongoing development projects. (((( THIS WILL CRASH THE USA MARKET)))))

Brandon is squinting at you!

Lol you realize that when Trump and company see the demand for MAGA they're going to give the SP@C a shit agreement and demand a higher market cap. Exact same thing happened with LCID and look how that turned out for the buyers at $50+.

Holy shit it's happening, movement on SPY is happening
Sometimes I'd kill to be break even
!banbet TSLA -5% 1w yea that's right I did it. My last yolo
If someone’s ugly the last thing they need to do is be here yeeting their net worth into the void lmaooo
I’m just a businessman doing business
Tired of this boomer bubble market and everything from used shit box cars to new houses being ridiculously priced
Omg spy is rallying, its now 461! Holy shiieet
MU 90 calls. Free money.
VIX dying all day hopefully that translates into a decent power hour
i fucking hate paying 24% on taxes
IBM- the ticker says it all…
very few people are just "really good looking" without those things. I'd estimate less than 1% of people are in that category. 

The rest of us have to actually work at it.
SPY puts gotta be the play now right?? Right????
Manifesting a EOD pump🧙‍♂️
So basically what makes this fun. Now I have reasons other than I lost money today as to why I didnt have fun.
2840
More retarded than shorting TSLA , it can double from here and bankrupt you. No professional trader that only do short trades for a living will short a stock that traded 440M volume.
Saw an interesting article yesterday saying that most kidnappers in Haiti ask for food as the ransom.....


That place is massively fucked for so many different reasons

It could also not do anything

I bought two trump shares as a signal. If it 200x over the next year then I can assume trump will be next President and all my money goes to SPY calls. If it fails I assume he won’t be President and all my money goes to SPY puts.

If they think you are exclusive it's shitty. If you tell them you date other people fine.
If you ugly AF you can do things that will marginally improve your attractiveness like lose weight, gain muscle, dress well, clean hairstyle, groom facial hair, etc. But if you’re really good looking you can none of those and be more attractive than the person who does all that other stuff. Do with this information what you will.

yes, you are underpaid.  Time to polish that resume and start looking, especially now that you have 5 years of experience under your belt.  I wouldn't wait any longer because then future employers will think that you stayed at one place for too long and have become ingrained to one system/org.  Get as much diverse experience as you can.

Spy refusing to die off. We’ll never see red again.
#Came home from the doctors with a prescription for DAILYSEX. She looked and said it’s actually for DYSLEXIA
In theory tucker will talk about it tonight… 10 million people will buy 10 shares in the morning…. Most people still haven’t even heard about it yet… when the true noobs pile on in the morning it’s gonna hit $100… DD
3 weeks will be spent trapping the last bulls
wtf lmao
iv crush is a bitch
Is it my nap time
It’s no fun not being able to day trade impulsively anymore
TLT Puts about to go brrrrr
ppl keep doubting the absolute retard strenght of spy.
then do it, you been preaching this whole time about it
Here's an award and some ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553). Now, you can't say you went home empty handed.
Congrats, fuck you, tell Julian I said hi.
CLF er tomorrow pre market
1 share is same price as a dozen.  Make money or get fat?  Bullish on DNUT.
ive had my helmet since I was like 3 years old.
You know a stock is dead when retards start screaming “BUY THE DIP”
what calls you have bic boi
PYPL...but I'm an idiot.
Automod working overtime today.
1dte 452.5 Spy puts it is then
They’ve got spy smothered with a pillow and he’s fighting back 😳
You serious?
RIP palosi capital
lol, yea some sources say 900.00, other's say 899.89
It’s literally been every other comment? How have you not seen it
So many good opportunities this week which brings me great joy to announce I lost $700.
Fuck it, I'm holding overnight and getting back to work.
Do you discriminate against green shrek dicks or tendies?
Cashed out original I bought at $12 and letting rest ride to $100 whenever that is
my GOOGL 10/29 calls will definitely print

Spy is like my ex. She just keeps toying with me and owes me money..

Name your child 455 and you can hit it everyday
SPY 453c expiring tomorrow
come on man, calls on SNAP. you even paying attention?

FOMO is a bitch!!!
What plays
#IT'S BEAR SLAYING SEASONS
Was it contract work? Demand that they put in writing why they rescinded the offer; they have to comply.
[deleted]
My friend mentioned it this morning.  So i got a couple shares. Wish i got more :/
I think 447 is reasonable
This shit is in purgatory rn
What do you guys think about CLF? Tank after earnings then a recovery?
No because they are woke.
Treasury dump incoming.

Strap on the helmets comrades
it's a SPAC, so it's been talked about in code. Code that's very easy to break.
Because you missed out?
PAYPAL OR AMD
Everyone expected Tesla to moon and it did
Party’s over. I’d leave.
&gt;Fed and their cronies are very obviously trying

as soon as you read shit like this you know the author of the comment is a retard
Any last minute plays boys?
Grats
i mean yields are going up
classic pump n dump formation on d double u a see
This as well.
Essentially
Maybe, but i think they're gonna get theta eatin for a few days, and even then the pullbacks probably gonna to be fairly shallow
Can we hit 455 tomorrow?
It's all over this thread today🥭
Holding because this thing is going to become the best theta farm for the year once options are listed
Finally you are getting it. 

Justification is unnecessary for everything in this game. It’s just buyers and sellers , pumps and dumps , pimps and whores.
Holding because as much as DJT is a shitposter expert, the libs will install and use the app just to reply and try to troll him, which will grow the app and company more and more, Maybe it won't be the next fox news, or cnbc etc.. But, i think it will hold it's own.
ripping...down?
Same bro. Portfolio at ath from early September. Feels good
Everyone expecting SNAP to moon 🌙, it will be hilarious if it tanks 😂
HCA
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
I got out at 19 but waiting to get back in. There's another day in the week.

I think it will flatten for Monday, though, and until the platform is launched. The euphoria will last as long as the platform works as anticipated. Hopefully it allows video from the beginning. That could be the OG killer app.
Ok , if spy can go to $450 for just confidence building, I will consider calls at $450.  Instead of $447-$448 today
Retards that belong here
Even Pelosi is buying the 🥭
Yes, but less so than options.
What the fuck is up with today? All the stocks I got have either put out solid good news, good futures, above higher than expected earnings, or any combination of the above. Plus good job reports. Yet the stocks just keep tumbling. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553)
if snap beats bigly we going on a fucking moon mission
lol crash has to be incoming. Fed and their cronies are very obviously trying to keep SPY here until the 5EMA catches up since its so far behind (449). It hasn't hit it in 6 days now with three gaps in the chart. 10EMA is crazily 10 dollars behind at around 442. Any decent pullback at all and tumble down we go since the 5EMA will also pullback lower. That's why they wont let it go lower than 451.85. If you are getting any puts now, do not do weekly's. I have my puts out until next year.
Come on SPY what the fuck. You have to end green
So like...is the Orange mans stock not mentioned here or what? Why didnt I hear about it until like 2min ago from a random friend?
Bullish harami pattern detected. All in on WISH
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Which earnings are y’all playing between AH and pre-market? I’m in SNAP
Really DIS? Flat this whole week
Anyway I blew my personal net worth milestone out of the fucking water today. Just with shares and selling options I'm up $15k over two weeks. Gonna celebrate tonite boys
Hold firm fellow retard
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/TyTakeProfitz (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 800.0 when it was 866.55 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
So tempted to actually do a 401k yolo in 456c 10/22
What type of retard doesnt take 300% gains in a day.
That’s your projection, it’s symbiotic I’ll clarify my thought ok
NET’s valuation is justified if u take into account that valuations dont need justification
meanwhile bonds absolutely fucking ripping. This is fun, I missed the craziness of last year cuz i wasn't looking at my port then.
They have to pump Tesla to 1000 in order to fight GME margin calls. 

Bullish on both
Still a pump n dump ho house in here lmao dumbasses
Verizon is literally my best investment right now
Account up relatively big today, one of the biggest day gain in a few months and I still have a substantial amount of cash left. This is probably the biggest day gain to cash ratio in my trading cAreEr.
A warrant let’s you buy one share of the stock after merger for a set price. Usually around $11. So if you buy warrants at $2 and the price of the stock is at $20 then you can redeem your warrant and pay a total of $13
Rivian ipo when.
Imagine SPY hitting ATH intraday tomorrow.
$460 confirmed.

Pelosi/Fed gonna pour all their money in SPY shares.
MTCH is a good play circle one


Yes . . . . . . . . .  No
Holding cuz of the nightly news

Power hour gonna be a sight to behold
Yes, I realize how group psychology works. Thanks.
NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - A record 347 million Citigroup Inc C.N shares traded hands on Wednesday, surpassing by far the New York Stock Exchange's one-day single-stock volume peak logged only last week, the exchange said after markets closed.
Aug 5, 2009

Until today. This is actually going to be in the record books lmao.
Soon
Just bought $7k of SNAP, feeling pretty good about it
you make it sound like a parasitic relationship when in the grand scheme it will gravitate towards mutual benefit
If I knew how to write bot code, I’d make a positive bot army. Like spread love and joy.
Spy should've just called in sick.
Puuuuuuuuuuush
Thank you for the tendies 👍🏻 glad I took your advice
If it's only a rumor then clarify that for investors.
Thanks investopedia.
cause the news will mention it tonight to everyone who didnt know today and they will want to get in just to say they did and it will go up again
"The next FOX News..!"
go for it, high profit probability with this
so it is more volatile than the stock?
So some Indian guy from the IRS told me I owe 5,000 in back taxes. I told him to go fuck himself and hung up

Ta is a self fulfilling prophecy.  Its glorified pnd.  If a bunch of monkeys draw the same line on a graph and then take a position because of that line then of course stock goes up.  Same for the inverse.  Like all pnds it works until one day it doesnt.  Just look up what happened to long term capital management.
Jesus fuck.

&amp;#x200B;

A stock warrant gives the holder the right to purchase a company's stock at a specific price and at a specific date. A stock warrant is issued directly by the company concerned; when an investor exercises a stock warrant, the shares that fulfill the obligation are not received from another investor but directly from the company.  
  
  
An equity stock option, on the other hand, is a contract between two people that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a specific price, prior to a specific date, referred to as the contract expiration date.
Tesla 900c volume is 🍌s
I may have actually sold the top perfectly. Hope it goes back up for the rest of you, though.

I just follow the price action, but I know DT's social network was hotly anticipated, so zero users because it's not live, but many who want to be a part. And I suspect they will even pay user fees.

I also think Mastadon is an excellent framework to begin. All software is buggy in the beginning.
i got sick of seeing it go up so i bought one share just to crash the stock

SPY 460 Tomorrow, and 455 today!
I'm punching myself for not getting in at 16.
I’ve been bleeding &amp; doubling down ever since lmfao
If SPY could just jump up like .2% that would be really cool for me. I feel like that's not a lot to ask.
damn now even powell insider trading. shits getting crazy
This is why I got in earlier. Cult will buy this shit up
It’s a sign if this closes at $45
pypl will never recover. never see a new ath. book it
Just bought back in for 9 shares at $43 because I’m a retard and also in it for the meme at this point.  This is a WSB movement.

Then I'll buy some then too
UVXY is dog shit. It goes down no matter what.
How hard is BB going to dump tomorrow? Asking for a friend
Why?
Amazon share stagnant forever
Yeah but you know rich boomers and incels will put all their money in it. So yeah it’s gonna go up. Won’t hold forever tho.
No drill until earnings are over. Maybe sideways.

Nope. Having a trial in CHIRAQ and Kim Foxx will influence to drop the charges

Fuck it, I might be in also
today has been great - sold my GME FD calls for profit when it tested $189-$190 zone and have sat on my hands all day. There were couple of plays, but wasn't really confident so not worth risking it with opex tomorrow
bought at 51, sold at 41 and now thinking of buying back at 46 with tripple the amount to make back my losses 🤔
44.81 here, but it's all good. I stop loss at less than a ps5 loss. All good.
My hands are made of paper mâché unfortunately.  I missed the big runup, got in at 11 and out at 14,  hopped back in at 18, rode to 22.5, then watched the rocket leave me behind.  All in all, still a good day
While a product doesn’t currently exist, the brand has undeniable value. The product doesn’t require any creativity, they’re not looking to innovate.

matters more I think that you're at the same level. if you own a house and they're still wondering what they're going to do with their life, prolly not a good idea.
Bought at 14 should I hold?
and depending on what they sell besides user information, i have a feeling certain demographics will open their wallets wide
Tsla
They are a brick and mortar company. They sell shoes
SPY been teasing all day
fastest -20% ever with stocks
WSB gets gifted a mega play and you guys catch on now... What were you people doing all day, seriously? Looking at TSLA option chains?
There's another day in the week. And I suspect it will do well tomorrow.
Long as they above 19 all good right?
God.  That was fun.
🤢🤮
Is anyone surprised?  I wouldn't be shocked if the spac disappeared by next week and said they didn't think this is viable business idea long term.  Take the money and run.
Stop loses r 4 pussies!!!

Half your age plus seven rule is legit. Do the math.
“Omg i missed the pump!! Fml!! It’s fine he was a bad bad man anyway🤡” 👉🏻 r/politics
The warrants are priced as if the commons are still worth $25.
Just snagged a 10-22 1000C for only $10. Easy money!

EDIT: Ha! Only been 15 minutes and it’s already worth $13.50. Easiest $4 I ever made 😎
I’m happy to know that I got in at the bottom basically (~13). If it drops all the way back down I don’t even care. I didn’t have life changing money in it. Just here for the fun of it.
🥭 on sale, buying more for my lunch fruit salad
There's another day in the week. When this hits the mass media, if it hits, it could do very well tomorrow.

SPX holds premiums better than SPY and been having better outcomes trading it.
Annie's tiddies tho.
Glad to see it dropping. Hope it drops to $25 or less so I can hop back in.
And now it dies. Rip to anyone who bought in over 50. Enjoy your bag.

Spy being ghey
Was looking at it today, want to get puts, just not sure on timing
My stocks have their ups and downs
Let’s Go Bramala!
bought put before earnings for last 4 qtrs, works every time
Dis is so fucking boring bitch WTF PUMP TO 190 SO I CAN BIY A FUCCCCCCING HOUSE FUCCC
Why x2
Anyone looking at ATVI? Wondering if it could go  on a mild run here...
Imagine buying it at 690.69
imagine paying to work in an office filled with strangers
I fucking knew i shouldve bought that at 14$ this morning
Are we actually buying INTC calls?
No .com domain available at the time of purchase
376 million in volume. Unbelievable.
That’s why i set my buy orders to 49.99
I got warrants so just call me Sheriff
I mean I made 15% in 3 mins buying the halt 20 mins ago so
Yep
It is much more fun to just hint at it.
How does warrants even work. Why is it so behind
Someone tell me why NET deserves to be valued at 58B (95 P/S) with 130m rev per quarter, 50% growth and net loss
stocks generally go down bfore they pump. not sure why this is, maybe ppl are hedging against the risk of earnings miss?
I might have the worst trading record with FB. I’ll let you guys know if I ever buy in again. Inverse my FB trades
It’ll double from $50 easily
You have to be watching the charts for the stock that shall not be named.
Cheaper plus leverage

Heard this like 5 days in a row now
Then go on and make a ban bet
Buy VIAC dip
Im invested in vale but its been getting hit hard.
I overslept and bought at 10. This shit is insane
PYPL valuation is way too high man. P/E of 66 is not even close to historically good. After the FED destroys the markets PYPL will be a good buy. I'd wait till after NOV 3rd to start making bets on stocks that have high P/E compared to their historical average.
Why
I was in options. Lol nvm
Heard AOC shorted at $21
I love that guy!
Why do people add an "s" to names of grocery stores like Krogers, Wincos, Safeways...etc.
Imagine buying this shit at $50
I think the real winner will be whichever one is still alive by 2024
PYPL had lost 30bil alone in market cap the last two days. And their PR team has said nothing. What a joke
libs not always the smartest
Is it me or snapchat being purposely pushed down. Monday it literally sold off but now it's barely budging
The recorder version 😉
AMD’s 5 year chart gets me inflated
Someone let me fomo back in!
I read a fucking article about it this morning, wish it had placed a heavier emphasis on the fact you could trade the SPAC…..
It's gonna be a drama explosion everywhere!
Did you make eye contact?
Buy the fucking warrantssssssss
not with bank earnings popping off. tomorrow we moon.
but stonk market correlated ?
I wouldn't hold past today if I'm being honest but who tf knows, it's a clown market
I never know what any of you all are talking about
if 45's SPAC closes below 45 today then Brandon will win in 2024
Joe did
Lmao holy shit. Wish i had been paying any attention For a 300% gain on shares. Too Many meetings
So what do they do to justify $1k? \*waiting for popcorn to pop\*
Wrong sub try r/politics

Jurassic park theme starts playing 🎻
out at $49
It already hit 52
Yeah, all the other China scams similar to this 1 that go bankrupt after their big pump
If it's market cap gets big enough to post the ticker here, it's going to be the most memed stock for weeks, and then WSB is going to be blasted on the news as far right lmao
It already did once today
Imagine not buying a stock that's gaining 350% plus gains because 🥭 MaN BaD, politics dont pay the bills, pull your head outta your ass and make some of this fuckin money!

Remember the $7+ jump on SPY day? Wanna guess what that was from? Bank earnings. And we got more bank earnings today such as:

American express, Honeywell, Intel, chipotle, SVB Financial Group etc

Too late to get in. Might as well watch from the sidelines to avoid becoming a bag holder now. Congrats to those that got in early!
U will luv it at $100 tomorrow
Idk about that but damn.

Haha. More than FB.
Cycle out eod
haha Tremp stock up 400%? nothing to see here
What is going on right now?
r/politics is probably the most dense collection of dimwits you can find.
Same but sold at 36 like a bitch
All these trumpers bout to learn what bag holding is
That won't help, if this thing collapses.
What stock are you all talking about?
That SPAC is nuts

Nope. Its a sketchy chinese pump and dump

What’s their business model again? Does it even have a platform/website? At least we all know what gme/amc does……or Nikola….
It’s actually hitting $50. What a ride.
I sold at $19 AMA.
Hope you're right. But I have calls...my apologies.
Thanks AAPL. It would be really weird and spooky to see green in my portfolio every now and then, but I know you're protecting my theme and also know red is my favorite color.

I didn’t buy at $23 but I like it at $50

Bulls too cocky
Ya, enjoy getting filled 10$ below your ask when this plummets
I’m buying shares . But I’m not sure that we haven’t seen the bottom yet..  calls are tempting .
Start nutting !!
People are buying it and more people buy it which in turn pushes the price up?
I did too and bought back in
Some lean left, some lean right, I lean green 🤑
This would be quite the spot for a market rug pull...

But it probably won't happen today.  Too much 'tard strength.
Out at $50.95 gl to everyone

fuck it, added 10 more shares at 45
Shits gunna go a couple days green….. fucking orange face
Sketchy pump and dumps arent about trying to time the top. Its about taking profit and getting the fuck out before it falls off a cliff.

Hit $50 and I'm gonna nut myself to the International Space Station
I’m sure their float has increased since then.
Nothing like a good shelled bhole
I can't wait to sit back and watch the 🥭spac loss porn scroll by when this fomo fueled rally collapses.
Yesterday was a massive bear flag on PYPL. Today is healthy consolidation and will move up from here. Once they announce the deal isn't happening this will go back to 270
Is this a long or P&amp;D.  It can’t keep going can it?
I think that’s a bit inaccurate. I’ve held for over an hour and I’m at 100%

Never mind I see it now
Haha.  Please tell me you know how that really went down.
So when it hits 1.5 b in like 10 minutes can we mention the ticker?
What
TSLA $900 is inevitable.
I can’t seem to reply to your new comment, I can see it in your profile but it doesn’t show up in the thread. I think maybe it was blocked because of one of those links. Anyway, there doesn’t need to be a catalyst for every time SPY moves one direction or the other. It’s had a massive recovery since last Wednesday, up like $20 in a week dude. If there’s a pullback, nobody is gonna be surprised. 

You’re acting like it’s guaranteed that those 456 calls end up printing, and they still could if SPY has a huge day tomorrow, but regardless of possible catalysts or the lack of bad catalysts, it’s far from a sure thing. Sometimes shit just goes flat for a couple of days for no reason, and if that happens, your calls are toast. 

You sound exactly like you did leading up to your 450c expiring worthless, like you’re certain the market will act a certain way because of a couple news articles. The market is irrational sometimes dude. I hope your calls work out but SPY’s quick upward momentum has definitely slowed down and you only have the rest of the day today and tomorrow for some big moves to happen.
Wow

Only down 44% on my calls. Buying shares now, in the long run this will come back.
Now is the time to get like 1000 shares so you can sell premium for the next year. I’m thinking 40% OTM weeklies just to be safe.

So there's the question on this one as to why.  The TSLA volatility spiked at 1:00 this afternoon while it maintained the 890 price range.  Something happened at that time, well after the ER.  strange.

She’s already locked n loaded
Zynga regularly trades between 9 and 11, so it is very low right now. The 15% app fee reduction from Apple and the unrestricted DLC from their own store will really help it. And they're expanding, now working on Switch games

As for Activision-Blizzard, they haven't been the same since the MW2 and BO2 days, and they're under fire for treating women badly. Zynga is the opposite and has been regarded as one of the top companies in treating women well in the game industry. ZNGA has huge growth opportunity and people want to work there, while ATVI is already huge and not taking steps to progress, imo. They were spamming games before last year and being lazy, except like 2020 where they changed things up and copied Fortnite and PUBG. They need work to come back. Just my 2 cents.

There are no patterns. TSLA and NFLX may dump hard tomorrow. The real move is never apparent till the next week. Look at TSLA on Jan. 26. Tanked 80 dollars over three days then bounced right back to 860 lol. Then it dumped hard.
What about Tim Honks? The guy who played Wilson in cast away? He has pretty good returns

Tesla valuations are still crazy high. It has room to grow I think (once they got the battery storage down for public home use). Long term I can see tesla 1500+. That said right now its very dependent on rates being low. Tapering happens tesla will see 600 again.

What school do you attend where all you have to do is show up and not study?

I graduated from UNLV a semi decent school and I had to work two full time jobs on the strip and study in order to pay for it and graduate.
I sold at the open.  And watched it do what it should have as TSLA went from 860 to 890.   It was down to 0.35 st some point.  And then about 30 minutes ago, tsla was still up big, and the options chain went insane.

It was late 2008.  The world was in crisis, because the investment bankers had made huge bets on collateralized debt obligations with no value, and had squandered away most of the world's invested wealth down to Zero.  The banks found out about it first.  This trickled down to the business owners in January / February 2008.  The layoffs of Little People happened in February  / March.  And most of 2008 was consumed with news articles about "Financial Crisis!  Major bank collapses!   End of the world!  Great recession!"

I just looked at TMC’s chart and wow.  I remember when that was being pumped here and idiots were buying it and now it’s with pennies on the dollar less than a month later.  Lots of ruined lives from that one.
That's true it seemed like it was stuck and didn't move until December but I feel like this time around it'll be different giving the fact that there's alot of movement going on rn. But during that time there was still a couple moments when spy opened and only ran a couple cents and closed a couple cents below the open price and then the next day it.opened a few dollars above previous open price and ran up a couple dollars setting a new high so idk it's in the air rn
I do not have the stone hands to play pump n dumps; every time i watch everyone panic sell i just feel the urge to join them
"Closed" lmao his position expired over 90% worthless. He literally admitted it live on CNBC this week.

Yeah, ideally I would have gotten out as soon as it dipped back below open, but I was in a work meeting and not paying attention. If I see it drop below $451.50 again, I’m out.

This is what I noticed about spy 🕵️‍♀️ just hear me out but first I got a 457 call 30 contracts. From looking at the historical data when the price of the open and high are neck and neck usually the next day spy opens above open price from the previous day then goes on a run. That's all iv been seeing when spy is in this particular situation

I listened to an idiot and didnt buy in in December 2019 because of his dumb advice and shitt talking, i eneded up going all on after it already 10xed and bought my shares at $500 post split 

Still mad at that fucker
The spy play is right in front of yall. We trade sideways today and tomorrow we open above 451 and run to new ath! There's no way we dip tomorrow it wouldn't make sense that's just my take though.
portillos easily a 10 bagger
Next time block every single bear mentioning PE, only morons use that for growth stocks. Just because they're too many pushing that bogus argument doesn't make it true. Block TSLAQ altogether and read those damn analyst reports (because you know who's pushing the price up? institutionals after big names scrambled today to raise $TSLA's price targets, they LOVED the earnings report), all growth assumptions are there to read and you can then decide for yourself whether you subscribe to those projections. Selling just because the TSLAQ cult are laughing together like hyenas is stupid. Listening to r/investing isn't smart either, those punks are happy with less than 2%/year on bonds.
Started putting MCT oil into my coffee. Watch out world, i'm gonna start making $2/day instead of $1/day
Naked short it
Sold my calls, feel free to dump
Why would they do this!!!
Tesla ATH chatter to resume.
Only 20, but with the split 100
Holy shit. not sure what retard just mentioned IBM dropping that bad when barely missing earnings but January calls almost look like free money. Fuckin day trade limit.
Won’t give the divi with a call
No I wasn't holding at the time i just came across them (and bought)
100 shares
You may be looking for r/investing. I would gamble it a call or two ITM on $SPY!
How many shares did you have at that time?

What would you do with $500?

Say you have just $500 to invest in any way you’d like. Your goal is to turn that $500 into as much as possible in the span of 2 weeks. What do you do with it? How do you go about investing it? Or will you do something completely different?

Looks like party this weekend. Greenest week in years.
They keep listening to the MBAs who only care about the shirt term quarterly profits to keep the stock high, and now the stock isn't high because we even shareholders know that Boeing is what you'd get if HP make airplanes instead of printers.

Same MBA GE six sigma twats. I feel for the good people who work there. But they won't fix their shit until their stock shows it's broken. That's all they look at. They think the stock price is a leading indicators and not resultant indicator. They're stupid and wrong.

EAR looks like it’s got support and institutional buyers.  Back to $22
Theta gang wins. Fatality!
I have no experience to suggest this other than I grew up on a farm raising corn in the midwest and can say that high commodity prices (wheat, corn, alfalfa, any cattle feed really) usually takes a couple years to draw back as farmers adjust rotations. Add in to this the fact that china may be reupping purchase volumes, and you have a perfect situation for farmers to benefit for a couple year.

Droughts across rocky mountain front range and bad weather in Brazil isn't helping supply constraints either so.... IDK about shorting corn fella. might just trade sideways for a long time.  


Edit: and I sell cattle feed for a living so i guess that counts too. maybe a slight pull back in corn but I'm not really seeing that happen yet in the futures market. I think you saw corn peak above $6 and it's already drawn back to it's healthy range in the 4.80-5.40 range. but what the fuck do i know. good luck to ya

PLTR is about to break through its 200 day moving average and head up again. Bought Feb $29 calls just incase it takes a bit but I'm expecting a run up towards earnings and selling before. Probably once it hits 26.50 or so to get some nice tendies.   


Not a face ripping play but should net a nice 40-60% gain depending on how fast the run up is.

Guys, is PYPL good buy. I dipped a lot because of rumor that they would buy PINS
Maybe you were just mungery
I got a 457 call 30 contracts. From looking at the historical data when the price of the open and high are neck and neck usually the next day spy opens above open price from the previous day then goes on a run. That's all iv been seeing when spy is in this particular situation
Never feel bad about profit. quit lookin at the ticker and find another play. it is the only way
I WILL hold these SPY puts. I WILL not take a loss
My thoughts were it will rip today tomorrow and then next week might be reckoning.
We’re gonna break ATH before close. Look at the chart

I still think this is way overblown.  Apple makes in app purchases so frictionless, and also has great customer service and will give you a refund if things suck.  I am not going to go through hoops to pay for anything in an app and I doubt most people will.  For example you go 🌈🐻and sign up for grindr but change your mind and go 🐂 on match Apple would give you a refund no questions asked.
It's possible for SPY to open up at 690 tomorrow and run to 4200.
That's exactly what I'm going for

It’s not happening my dude. It’s sucks how you convince yourself that something is guaranteed when it’s not.
I once got a lewd felony charge for whacking off at night with the lights on during trick or treat hours.

Was watching show 'Dope Sick' with my wife on hulu, there is a part where this girl is all strung out and a guy approaches her car and wakes her up to see if shes ok.   


She goes "$50 for a BJ, $100 if you wanna fuck me"   


I go to my wife "same rate?"   


She laughs and says "LOL! Sounds good"  


Was planning on having a crisp $100 in my pocket for her tonight, then I lost all my money on $SPY calls. Tragic.

The weitd thing is Microsoft were discussing the acquisition for 51BN, paypal offered 39BN, if it didn't go through last time, why would it go now? I think it's an over reaction, thinking to get a few calls considering the earnings are coming as well
That's a fact I noticed that

From up 15% this morning to down 15%, should have sold…0
fake tesla dip. buy the fuck outta of it!
Nah, want to build my rig but I can’t find a damn graphics card
I'm assuming they'll create new shares to make the purchase... which would be about 160m extra shares. Paypal float is 1.18bn so around 13% dilution. 

10% seems like an overreaction. Adding Pintrest to the company would increase their revenue and gross margin by about 10%.  


Hmmm. I may have just convinced myself to buy the dip

Bro AAPL is going to drive me fucking nuts today.

Can we fast forward to all my earnings plays so they stop bleeding
Depending on the position you might get free stock.

Step 1: make money
Sold everything in my Roth expecting a downturn. Didn’t happen. Went all in on IBM today because I was bored at work. God damn holding cash is boring
Last hour of trading on Friday,
#There’s an affirm job posting, I find it hilarious applying to jobs where I’ve bought their stock before. Wonder if they pay well
Tim Cook, get up you lazy fuck
Alright since we are back at square one I just bought 5k in multiple tickers. No outs or calls. Time to close my app and open it next week. Y’all wish me luck. I have get 50k+ divided by 5 so like 10 or so tickers I have randomly put 5k in
paper hands getting out of $WISH today, then $7 next week. Earnings Nov 10 and Holiday Season coming up

Fuck me spy not that way
Hopefully you have an extra set of sheets
TTWO had a monstrous month. Should’ve bought calls when i said “hmm, looks really cheap”
If you can survive on $20 per day then you can make a living day trading stocks. All you do is buy calls on a stock that is going up and then sell once you make a minor profit. Then you cash out and go get some McDonald's and chill all day.

Only thing is that you'd probably have to live out of a van.
Please let us know what you are buying next so we can inverse you.
Scalping spy calls was not the move today. Ouch
I nailed the bottom on ABNB yesterday, almost perfectly, but of course got called away for a few hours and missed selling the top.  Then, thought I'd see how it played out today.  Fuck me.

Well summer is pretty much over..
Had two girlfriends back to back, first one was almost double D's and second one was solid B cup. I enjoyed the sex with GF #2 vastly better because I actually loved her far more even though GF #1 was probably more experimental and better in bed. I can't imagine sex being so bad to the point of it being a deal breaker with a girl you actually are considering marrying.
Just bought a metric fuckton of calls in an ETF that has over $1.7 billion in Uranium assets alone.

It’s insanity
Lmfao we’ll see eod
it gave back enough for me to grab a 30% gain on some fd puts...i am convinced that the only way i can trade tesla successfully is to watch it like a hawk for 10-20m and get in and out with whatever I can
I honestly just like NFLX, TSLA and SPY for high premium LEAP plays. This ain't worth the money IMO if going near the money or ATM.
Right there with you…. Do something / anything
Carvana + Root the ultimate combo play right now. Underlying assets values are only skyrocketing for them
like picking up nickels in front of a steam roller.
Anyone buys COCO today?

Looked at them yesterday but they were too expensive
Proof he sold?
&gt; I'm not interested in talking about crypto.
Gordon Johnson looks like salad fingers
Lols my dad is already retired, but his company begged him to come out of it since they were in such a desperate need of manpower. Large companies like Thermo Fisher, moderna, and other big tech companies wanted to expand. After they finish their next round of contracts, there’s barely any work left at all
So I guess the answer to OPs question is us lol
SPY gonna do anything or what?
I thought about doing a banbet for tesla 900, but this morning I didn't think there was a chance in hell it would happen, then almost immediately it became obvious it would.
TSLA gonna give a bit back?
How are Michael Burry fans doing today on their $TSLA short???

Can't seem to find anything but the possible acquisition. Is it really the reason for -10% in 2 days?
Sold for a loss
It’s not recovering though… it’s having a really bloody day. Have the purchase been confirmed?
If you don’t shower or brush your teeth daily you should feel bad about yourself.

I thought paypal purchase was good news?
Keep your head up my dude, somebody has to hold these bags
Okay got out of my FCEL calls with a little gain, not sure what the next gamble will be though 🤔
No they can't go above MAX gain
Tough one. Are you up on it? If there's good meat on the bone maybe sell and buy further out on the next dip. Probably what I would do anyway.
Serious question. Should I hold my $SNAP calls through earnings???
Did you get it in writing?
I am straight up not having a good time right now
Wtf DIS.  I missed the jump this morning and now it's just slowly dipping away.
Lol right who drinks anything other than water and beer. Losers that’s who
The $12 today lol
These BB and ME bags are getting lighter...
Sophie, baby, don’t do it....we were having so much fun
Holders &amp; buyers club rn. Average volume deficit is the amount of people holding or buying
Who’s playing SNAP earnings? I’m thinking calls it’s been down all week and they normally have great ER
Got an offer for $80k/yr job, received start date, put my two weeks in at my brain dead job, and offer got rescinded this morning.

might fuck around and eat some lead
They don't. But their software is integrated in the app. So if SNAP pumps, PYPL sees some love too
Gasoline? What?
I mean we're paying premium everyday it doesn't hit but yeah hope we seen green like others!!
Mommy, iam scwade of the big bwad baew.
The $12 top or the $60 top lmao
Doubt ❎
So when TSLA breaks ATH will we see another 3% movement by eod?
YUp! Buy calls 2-4 weeks out
Hulk dicks
Vita Coco. Bullish af
More buyers and holders than sellers
Can't wait to get sliced up trying to grab PYPL at the right time
Gd i can’t believe i just bought that
volume on spy lower than my high school gpa. im worried, lads.
Lol Thursdays always green
So if TSLA goes over 900, is it 🚀🚀🚀 time?
Has to be euphoric buying at this point lol
It's only popular cause poors can buy 1000 shares and feel like a big boy investor
I hope this market crashes into the pits of hell at this point cause wtf is this
Holders !

What drinks aren’t plant based?

I have snap call :) didn't know paypal owned snap..
I sold my $900 tsla calls yesterday, I’m gonna be fucking sick. 

Literally
The Grinch stayed green throughout an entire movie.
Not a surprise, you saw that market cap right?
I’m sure I need my head checking, but I am so tempted to buy the BB dip. Perhaps because I was a bag holder for so long.. I feel naked without it. Odd and disconcerting.
My head is dense and I'm not sure what that means. Do you happen to have a link?
Imagine thinking the 10y was gonna stop tech ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Also, if you didn't know. SNAP has earnings tonight. If they shoot up, PYPL will get a boost too.

There’s probably opportunities to enter back in.

I got over a grand in this. I am sitting just fine. We got 2 weeks for it to bounce back
There isn’t one
TSLA fuckin moving boiiii
I imagine some dork entered a buy order for one share of TSLA at 900 just to be able to say he made TSLA hit 900
Up 128% on my SKLZ calls, just sold. Is this what it feels like to make money?
I win if TSLA hits 900 at any time before expiry of the bet.  TSLA hit 900
If Tesla pushes thru 900, where the next wall?
Midwest gang. Lines are stupid though.

You are correct. You should probably sell at 90% of max.
Im bullish on WISH but your last sentence is just not close to true.
$1000 10/29 TSLA calls are still cheap
My call really hopes so!

Yeah right 😆 take profits before you’re conned by one of the greatest con men of our time
Should I dump this baba call
I got in late but am up over 37% seriously doesn't make sense
Anyone looking at Rio Tinto? Down like 40% from 52 week high, has a good P/E ratio, and pays out a 10% dividend. Am I stupid for considering?
Bought at 6am right at $12.22. Liquidating other positions to buy more. We like the stock!

Probly right. Crazy to think this is real life.
Tesla is breaking through 900
It’s that $PLTR earnings runup time.  

Get your tickets to the show
I ALREADY DID. This is by no means the time to dance yet lol. I’d be more scared if TSLA grinded up all day but this just looks fake to me
DIDI news must be pretty big. will someone find out what it is already? thx

you can be right about Tesla and it can still go to $1T
Lmaooo. Nobody wanted to buy over 900 and become the top bag holder down the road.

Ok where is the dude that said he was going to eat a bag of jelly beans with his ass if Tesla hit 870 ?
Yeah, I sold it just now. Got it for $490, sold for $910.

Hi at all Bears, especially TSLA Bears. You don't have to feel like losers, because it is no feeling anymore you are actually some fucking useless losers. 

Go delete your trading accounts and keep living your shitty life. 🤡🤡🤡
Donald Pump today, Donald Dump tomorrow
Lol, you think normies are going to get in this fast? Wait until this afternoon.
$SNDL posts get so much hype but no one wants to buy in unless it’s too late
For whoever needs to hear this: SELL some TSLA today and take profits. This run is pure euphoria. It'll dip back down to 700 in the next few months, buy back in then.
INTC guidance better be we going to fuck up AMD and Nvidia for max moon

Well by the looks of it, that could be the case big upward trend after leveling out might be time for it to grow past $1 again.
Shout out to the guy who posted about DIDI app yesterday
Yes , take profit and roll it if you wanna make more. Don’t get greedy. That spread is like 90% there
You're greatly underestimating his cult
he ded
Isn’t this about the point that Elon’s brother sells?
Lets all get drunk and stoned with SNDL on the moon! 🦍 🚀 🌝
Why. Just why
that last minute save is always the best feeling
Sell @ 20. It may climb more, but why risk 4k. If you are bullish on it, take your initial investment out. Leave 4k worth in there. If it moons it moons, if it doesn't you didn't lose anything (you could take 1k profit and leave 3k as well so you feel like you won something in case it tanks)

what price?
u/shutupdigit you gotta fix your fantasy team, you have like 4-5 people with bye weeks this week
I would be so grateful if it hits $1 so I can close out all my shares

Why is Ulta flying?
Zoom out. Yes.
TESLA PRINTS DIFFERENT 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
TSLA up 23% (or nearly one whole Toyota mkt cap) from exactly one month ago
grabbed two 11/19 PYPL calls
If paypal acquire it it'll cost like 30% of their company might be why and nonbelievers are skeptical it'll be worth that I guess :/ meanwhile I feel like my half a grand is lost for good. Bad option play at open.
Monthly $280c when it was priced at $260
TSLA touched $900 at least, but still needs a clean break.

52 week high is 900.40.
Lmfao omg so glad I got in
THE BIDEN PUMP IS REAL!
Thoughts on PayPal dip?
I hope $SNDL Hits $1 looks to me it’s spoiling like crazy right now. Might get close to $1 today who knows
Goddamn TSLA has such retard strength.

There is no top
Dang, Bears are f\*k. TSLA hit 900.  SPY Green.  Balance is being restored.
They’re slow to hear about shit lol. I’m thinking major sell off then another rally at some point. Watching it like a hawk.
Who else is buying SDC FDs?!!!

Debit spreads can't go past the max gain right?


I have a Tesla 865/875 spread that I can sell for 900. Since the max of this spread is $1000, there's like no point in trying to hold right? It'd only reach that max if I held till expiration (tomorrow)

PYPL is trying to make an app more like SHOP. Read up on it. It's pretty neat. But even if there is no acquisition it will head back up. They just need to make some sort of comment on this. It's really all speculation at this time. That's why I can't understand why it would drop so hard off of a rumor
Trump couldn’t start a coffee pot. Guy is an idiot
Yes bro, just don't buy weeklies give yourself some time. Don't let theta fuck you

Anyone here hold TQQQ long term?
TSLA just $1 away from ATHs.
Tilray looks ready to be squeezed to 16$ if it can hit 12.5 keep a close eye on it

And to think I only bought SNDL to sell covered calls. Is this what you wrinkled brains feel like when you finally get a win?
My tsla ban bet gunna come in before the day lmao
Maybe I'm a paper handed bitch, but turning a 20% profit on TSLA calls I thought were doomed feels pretty alright.
Congrats to Tesla bulls 👏🏻🥩🍾
Why would ETFs s reduce volume ? People that otherwise wouldn’t touch krepto due to too much hassle/security risk will be entering that market via those etf’s, increasing volume
Elon breaking up with grimes was bullish as fuck.

Where is the guy with 80k spy put 10/22? Is he okay?
[deleted]
Which one
We are literally dollars away from all time high in TSLa
It’s true, stocks only go up.
Imagine thinking this isn’t just an institution propping the price up to keep their position in tact on Friday. Look at the volume and do the math. Its literally 3 $1B buy orders going thru the tape. My put spreads will print and this happens every time which is why I bought 10/29 expiry
It sucks we couldn't buy options on it
Elon daddy sending erections to space
Where are the options on Mangos thing? They need to hurry up with those

PINS and SHOP is a completely different kind of a company. PINS will be good for e-commerce and buyer's journey. I see a huge ad potential in PINS and it's  sad the rumor is dragging down PYPL.

I made $600 mangobux today, not bad for a morning's work
I think you degenerates have broken spy with all the 0dtes.  Normally SPY and SPX are in lock step but lately you have caused a .1% disparity.
It is but a big boy is pumping this. Volume looks like 3 massive $1B buy orders. I imagine they want TSLA above $900 to save their position Friday

Smash through that 900 barrier! I made a poor man’s bet with 10/22 915s.
Let me guess, SPY slowly trickles down to 451 then heads back to 452 in the last 15 minutes.  Degenerates everywhere take modest gains/losses and we do the same thing tomorrow.
Bought 100 shares around 10am, going to see where this goes.

I don't even understand why the garbage I own is going up, but I'll take it
Hoping that it doesn’t dump today !

Absolutely sell that if it's short term. This is going to run through 900
There’s no thrill quite like buying the dip

Come on TSLA bb just 3 more points to break the seal you can do it
Just put a butterfly on SPY 454 in anticipation for where it will land tomorrow. On a scale from 1-retarded how was that play?
Sold my F calls that were down more than 80% expiring tomorrow for +130%. 

Canceling all my meetings behind Wendy’s, sorry boys.
It's the universe, the stars are aligned against you.

It’s time!!!🚀
SNDL anybody?
My covered calls on TLRY are big fucked
Probably to just specifically fuck me over
EOW
Anybody know what’s moving futu up?
I SPY with my little eye an ATH
[deleted]
TSLA is tapping $900's back door. Its only a matter of time before it gains entry and the fucking begins.
Sell the top

Thank me later
i bought a put at its first brush with 897...if we dont bounce off 900 im bouncing out of the position asap
Not gonna lie. I have a PUT on TSLA that is absolutely fucked right now. My dumbass is still out here rooting for it to cross $900.
$SNDL up from .64 to .73 this past week. Looks to me it’s breaking out again. 🤔🚀🚀
🤔wonder why
You are thinking about it backwards. Just to clarify, the ETFs are based on futures (not spot price). But if they raise coin price, then COIN makes more money in the long run bc ALL coins go up and COIN makes more money on trading volume. The people who are buying BITO weren't going to buy coin directly on Coinbase. Probably using retirement funds.
What other etf’s are you in?
*pokes penn w a stick*

Do something
Any other juicy dips today besides PYPL?
Man had a 9:30am meeting and missed bb morning spike….. 2k profits missed :(

Easy.
Now do aapl mkt cap if they an ipad to ipad
Come on PSFE you can do it, don't be scurred
Most are getting vaccinated at this point lol. And some will buy at the top before it drops that’s pretty much how stocks work.
&gt; I don't know, I'm not a day trader.
Incoming SPY fomo
There has been no PR from PYPL. I think shortly they will announce something and it will bounce back. If they do aquire PINS I could see them as a SHOP type of company 😬
Can’t complain did a great play yesterday to today but I’m getting sick and tired of timing my exit and then the stock finally breaks the resistance point 😔
Wow Portillo's never laid off people during the pandemic. They're like the In and Out of hotdogs.
Come on bb break through $12
Oh boy, this sub is gonna talk about this Trump Media Company for weeks

Come on man. Surely your life is not ruined by this, maybe you think it is right  now because this just happened but you’ll get more chances, you’ll be alright, you can always make more money. Just keep working and learning!

If Tesla goes past 900 … I don’t think it’ll go under 900 anytime soon. That wall has to be massive

But wouldn’t ETFs reduce volume? And prices are relative so you just need to move less coin around, right? Would you rather trade an ETF or lose 2-3% each round trip trade?
Michael Burry more like Michael Burried.

Shit tossing money on that just because
I called weed stocks toxic. But I’m 22% on my TLRY plays so

Just set a timer for 10 minutes bro
Hope you didn't get weeklies
Spy has zero chill. Good lord
HOLD! We hit 950 either today or tomorrow !!!
No shame in it brother. It will go down eventually, just too much euphoria present still
I got in on TSLA at $129.96 and I'm selling today if it hits $900.  This is out of control
 Not the 10/22s. I had one 2 days ago when Tesla was at 870 and it was worth $750. Right now it’s worth $705 lmao
They don't correlate to anything. Bb and tlry went up based on completely different news, just happened to be on the same day.

I'm long now with Ford also. I typically buy it when I see the stock price really low. It's such an American iconic brand that even in financial trouble the unions wouldn't let the company fail. The government is helping them and even with their corporate bonds being rated low, I was glad to buy more of it at $9 - $10 last year. 

Initially told myself last year after I bought it cheap, I would sell when it hits 13, didn't and waited for to $15 sell. 

I did sell some shares 2 weeks ago when it hit that price for some profits. But I am looking at this as a long term hold. Will sell some more at $20, but will hold the stock for at least 2 years to see how the EV conversions go.
Yeah no thanks, if I could give a number I would probably be 5/100 on chasing higher highs

If TSLA doesn't close above $900 today, I think TSLA FDs makes a ton of sense, if we see a big pre-market break tomorrow above $900 (ATHs), tomorrow's regular action could be crazy with all the FOMO/momentum buyers panic buying.

Sounds crazy to say, but a $30+ move is very likely after it breaks $900 due to this return to all time highs from a year's worth of consolidation.

So Jim cramer is having vlad on tonight. Any questions we have for him or about his stock?

Can anyone help me articulate something that encapsulates the frustration of a publicly traded company that has a history of lying to its customers and restricting purchases and how to evaluate that company's p.e ratio on that?

I thought the TSLA upgrades wouldn’t come till Monday. I had to fight the urge not to yell out “the jigs up!” and panic sell yesterday. 😆
CROX was a monster a month the last time it beat earnings. think it'll ride up again?
SoFi is the gift that keeps on giving.

Sold tesla calls. This thing not breaking 900
Do I hold TSLA $940c for next Friday, I almost feel like that’s realistic
TSLA is an absolute unit!
It’s ok, so did I
Ford just beat it’s old 52 week high which was the five year high.
TSLA holy shit I just saw 900c 10/22 go up like $150 bucks in 2 mins
thank you papa elon, just made 1.2k in 30minutes ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
As long as you manage position size and don't go too heavy it's worth the risk IMO. that's pretty far OTM, theta gonna eat your ass if it doesn't move quick
Alright TSLA, have a day!

Thank you zillow for the free money.  Will start to crawl back up then shoot at their earnings on the 2nd.  Housing market is cray cray
Should've saved that for the weekend thread
Can't complain about TSLA move now shit
I am in bull conundrum. Do I dump 12c Mar 22 calls, and book profit, or more catalysts going forward?
Of all the thing I decided to get a call at open I went with paypal..
How the fuck is spy red
Guys save my Tesla 1000 banbet

Lev up 4%, will this thing finally run… no.
Wait maybe my VLTA ban bet wont screw me over
Where are the TSLA put holder noobs? Crawl out from under the rocks you’re hiding under so we can step on you, you bugs… you roaches.
Would've been up 50% if it did fill.

Thanks for the heads up tho :) appreciate it!

Hope you got a big gain from it
If it got a T and L it’s green baby 🤑🤑🤑
TSLA moon was completely predictable
i literally bought the tsla top
Thinking about that retard who went from 2k —&gt; 33k on TLRY options the other day. If he actually held, GGs!
Okay this is new for tsla - earnings were damn good but they’ve been damn good before - to 900!
My LVS posts a blowout miss and is only down 1.82% 😂
Absolutely with bank charter IMO
Never bet against papa elon musk rip tsla put bear

RKLB AND SRNE. 


Money time
The original meme is fucking back 🚀🚀
Going for the other kidney I see

lmao gay tesla bears getting rekt. tesla 900 fd calls were a low of 40 cents... now theyre worth 5$ lmaoo
We saw the same action on the btcorn, once it broke ATHs huge momentum buying pushed it up another 5%.

Same will happen with TSLA if it breaks $900.
holy shit that UPST green space needle. First 5 mins of the day my profit from 40k of NFLX calls was totally wiped out by my losses with 20k of UPST puts
holy fuck, tsla

Holy fuck. My rule for gap fills is to wait 5 minutes for the dust to settle before deciding to take a position. The $TSLA gap filled in &lt;2 minutes. I literally watched the call I want to buy go from $495 to $800 in 2 minutes, and now 11 minutes later it's at $2,300. Insane

Facts! Guys be too horny when they see dips, I’d wait ‘til the news blow over.
Lol, those 1000 calls still aren't going to do shit even with this gap up
$DIS
Usually when an acquiring company buys another company the aquiring companies stock dips and the company theyre buying stock price goes up. So I think PINS is a good stock to buy and Paypal is obviously a good stock to buy
Fuck it spy calls $455

Okay, alright, that’s fine, okay
Anyone else picking up FB leaps? Been thinking about going pretty hard

Not saying this is tax advice. Hypothetically, if you wanted to avoid the wash sale provision, you could sell on one broker and buy on another. When you aggregate transactions per broker, technically you haven’t lied or anything.

$DIDI ready for lift off 🚀
Digital world acquisition. That’s what you want to invest into if you want to invest in the meme truth trump thing.
Why does the Fed buy the market up before they release a freight train of badddd economic numbers?
SPY is hungry for $455 and I’m the man that’s gonna buy it
The stock market is pretty simple, it's about minimizing risk and maximizing gains, the #1 easiest way to do that is by.....haha there is a squirrel and a bird in the lawn ....
yeah it's pretty fun imo, but they've been making some big fuckups so it's also really fun to watch the chaos. 1st they told EU players they could transfer their players regionally while the traffic and queues settled down, then they were like nope sorry can't do it lol, but right now the game is having big issues with the economy.
Then do it. RSI and MACD are both leaning this way

Look at PINS price action tho.
If only I could borrow it myself - 100 bagger there, wish I had dumped all my $ in.  NET puts could pay off but that shit is insane so who knows.  I've been adding to MQ in the low $20s but it's a slow play and def not adding after that Citron multi-day pump.  Also who knew Citron did non-short reports.  If it goes back down to $20-$21 I'd scoop up some more.
Only $38 so could care less. Yoloing it.

Calls on Lambo
From your statement, can I assume you are no one.
I called that
PYPL would get good exposure and AD revenue with PINS. I think it would be good for them. There were some good points I read in an article about it. I'm sure there are mixed feelings but it's a good move for PYPL

I don't think ppl want paypal to acquire pins tho
I think snap will have a great quarter, but it doesn't seem like anyone cared with tsla or nflx
if QQQ somehow goes green today with bonds doing this, TSLA dropping, big earnings doing nothing to move big tech...

I'm banning myself and going in the woods for a couple weeks.
Today, I’ll be driving a Lambo or eating my cup of ramen looking at pictures of lambos in an old magazine after having to sell my computer and cut my internet after all my losses
So then you tell me why it dropped in price so dramatically, dumb ass? Like give any reason besides acquisition for the drop in its price just recently. I’ll wait...
Really sad about my baba calls
Why is SPY so scared of 453?

Thank you. I’ll pick you up in my lambo after the bell. Or I’ll show up your door with my cup of ramen asking for some spare change
I didn’t know they still made people like you.
I don't trust SPY's little hop on the jobs data

Bonds are telling us that they are concerned about the rumors of Manchin going R

No matter your political views, that increases the risk of drama over the infrastructure bill, the debt ceiling, and a bunch of other potential spending.
TSLA obviously
As jobless and continuing claims continue to go down each week….
Is social security socialism? Don’t we all pay into social security if you have a job?

THE RED DRAGON NATION’S EVERGRANDE......THE NUMBERS Wall Street Journal just put out are staggering, implying that there are  1.6 million acres of residential real estate under construction. If you do the math, it’s the equivalent of 72 million apartments/condos.  PROBLEM.....unlike the USA where you put down 10% and then the rest when your condo is finished, in dragon land you borrow 100% and pay it to buy it before construction begins. PROBLEM...average person owns 3 apartment/condos each....all on borrowed money for pure greedy speculation. PROBLEM... Evergrande has spent all the money and left projects unfinished by 25% to 90%. and no one has enough money to finish them, peasants can’t pay twice for the same unit and the banks are broke because the “flips” have crashed!!! This ponzu scheme has spread to 5 other major developers, and numerous banks.
How? He is back tweeting?
Godspeed soldier!
It's been in a consolidation pattern since January. The 20, 50 and 200 day moving averages have all converged, it's now trading at the high end of its consolidation pattern. It looks like it might finally be getting ready for a break out, and be the next leader on the leg up as opposed to the SPY or the QQQs.
the GME bullshit seemed to bring them all around because they thought they did something
I’ll toss 500 sheckles down on it.  Thank you!

I'm in Portland, I'm surrounded by them.
Long portfolio… what is that?
why puts why not just short or an inverse ETF?  With puts you need a big move to win.
What's interesting about it?
Take it for what it's worth. To believe in Disney right now is to be a contrarian against the consensus view on the Street. And if that doesn't change, then your stock ain't going nowhere. Cause its only institutional investors that can really move the price.
Due to the PINS acquisition. That's why they dropped. But when they actually finalize the deal they should get a good pump
Unfortunately we got a lot lurking around 😒

But it hasn't. In states that cut extended unemployment benefits early, there was no noticeable change in job numbers. In fact, in some cases it went down. In case you haven't noticed, the pandemic still hasn't been brought under control.

I’m here to inquire how I can turn my 2k into 10k after going from 20-40-2
Lol. Mostly cause at this point there is nowhere for Disney to grow. They are a global brand with presence everywhere which has snapped up virtually every valuable IP in existence. And while they are probably an existential threat ala Amazon when it comes to being a monopoly, stock wise, there isn't any future growth in them.

All I know is that there's a long line of people who have lost large sums of money because "TSLA is overvalued". Stop trying to tie things to fundamentals. That's boomer shit that doesn't apply to anything except boomer companies.

Trade the chart. Follow the momentum. This is the way.

(The chart says there's significant resistance at 900 so puts as it approaches 900 with a stop loss if it pushes through is not a bad play).

Wrong, some of us are here to gamble. It’s called wall street bets.
god this is going to be so regarded....the irony will be palpable.  His network is named truth, and is intended to fight "censorship" by "big tech" ......how much you want to bet there will be censorship galore on trump's network if people go on there and say the actual truth?

i have too many orange man stock rn
Could be a little late for that. Someone sold all the retail momentum this morning, and institutionals will dump that hot potatoe immediately at open.

I got a hunch Trump passed on his plans to some homies. I've never seen so much retail volume being soaked up pre-market.
Only? Every other company is suffering with supply shortages and Tesla is still growing
Yikes any day, they don’t outwardly invest or sell. The economy is collapsing like a star. Inwardly
Isn't it widely known that wework is a massive scam business?

That's OP's point
You do realize they bought Pinterest and that’s why their stock fell? Like it literally isn’t a “buy puts” situation. Like they bought a company, their stock dropped because of the expense, Pinterest rise a lot in price, the same relative to what PayPal dropped. Like it’s just a change of cash from one to another. Not like people pulled out and it rug pulled LOL. I hope  you enjoy those worthless puts.

They don't think covid is a a serious issue to their business.
Unemployment is bullish
Idk which sounds better, TRUMPBOOK or TrumpSpace? Perhaps Trumper?
Yikes..Japan’s Stock Market today.
Been having options bro and futures too apparently
1 750 put 11/19
Because that isn't really what happened. The lockdowns have only been in a few places, sometimes just a locality within a city, have been on and off anyway, and 'essential' workers have been allowed to go to work for almost all time.

The economy is still going because there was shitloads of government support during the worst of it, and the people stuck in lockdown don't actually contribute a whole lot to economic output anyway.

Most of the primary production is done in the regions, which have been going the whole time with no COVID and border controls to keep it out.

Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank just joined the list of $TSLA price target pumpers 🚀🚀🚀 Respectively raised to $905 and $1000 from $875 and $900. Again, puts will be fuk, both by IV crush and by the stream of analyst upgrades.
I will be unloading some bags probably, then using what little money I have left to YOLO 10/22 spy calls.
still looks bad, dude.
Two earnings where people expected huge moves on stock price, and they got next to none. *Theta gang*

How do either of them make money lol
Or at least heavily question them
I have been watching BROS lately.  Dutch coffee may be a better place than SBUX
Nice. TSLA's option IV is relatively low compared to where it's been in the past couple years, so hopefully it doesn't drop too much. But nice job getting in at a good time.

NET will never stop moving up, quit playing yourselves. Just buy leaps and enjoy the ride.
Nobody talks about Intel here so I think they might do okay. Slightly up after earnings.
Watch out everyone, he’s got a weapon!
Well based on me being correct the entire week, no.

This is all a run up till the get their bank charter. Probably going to dump a little soon after
Well the main one is an anonymous person or people that brought it forward claiming altered stats. They were obligated to divest that they do indeed hold a large amount of short interest in the stock. Cassava looks to have good protocols in place as they had independent statisticians compile all the results so looks like an obvious bullshit case and since the FDA already approved phase 3 trials while that was happening it is likely that they looked into those allegations. End result case will be dismissed or dropped. Other lawsuits are the same old when a stock drops we will sue on shareholders behalf and say that the company misrepresented their forward looking statements. Every stock that drops 50% or more in a short time has that. I’m in a good position on the stock averaged in at $46 and some change which is right about where it is. But I’m going to try and start picking up some calls. I just don’t know the timeline of the current litigation exactly. Leaps are expensive but might get a couple cuz I believe they will be worth it. Been holding this up and down for 4 cycles. Next one coming soon

Fair enough, but it’s not like Tesla is growing at a steady multiple. This valuation is absurd and you know it. It’s pricing in the idea that they’ll have the majority of the market share of all cars in the future. Unless you think Tesla will dominate cars like Apple does phones this is not going to end well.

What does that have to do with my answer? Every time when I point out to a $TSLA ber that using backward looking statistics on a growth stock is simply stupid, he immediately starts deflecting and answers in "but what about [insert another random flawed argument]" mode and the ber cult starts downvoting, as if downvoting makes a fact "less true". Your original comment is simply invalid and that's it. You can hate growth stocks if you want, but if you short them and use value metrics to support your short thesis, then all you're doing is just feeding yourself with confirmation bias. Of course a growth stock is going to look shitty when using value metrics, and conversely a value stock is going to look shitty when using specifically growth metrics.

Small caps are perfectly consolidated and have outperformed big caps over the past 2 months during the pullback.  That's typically very bullish for a small cap breakout relative to big caps like we saw late last year.

[https://i.imgur.com/zdQQ7vm.png](https://i.imgur.com/zdQQ7vm.png)

A big breakout on small caps is a good catalyst for next big move for SPX/SPY as well.

AAPL isn't growing 50% YoY. Compare the stocks in terms of PEG, not a TTM PE or other backward looking metrics. GOOGL is the closest (and slightly better) in PEG to TSLA.

that doesn't mean it's going to go down. you need more than that to make money on puts.
What are the things you guys look for before buying options and losing money?
Market always reverts to the mean. Just means the day it falls will even be more catastrophic. I think their gonna have some really stiff competition over this decade. Once the mainstream guys like Honda and Toyota can make an all electric car under 30k it’s a wrap in terms of growing a monopoly sized market share. At this point that’s what their pricing in, a monopolistic stronghold over the entire EV market. Unless a third of all cars on the road are Teslas in 10 years I don’t see how this valuation makes any sense
Every video in 2021 is staged.
I own an S and 3 and love them
Wtf you been smoking? And if no competition then why only 50% growth? Utter shit.

Facts that’s been my problem recently I’ve been paper handing a year ago I used to actually not be a bitch and hold and that’s when I was making most of my money
This and the forbidden corn. I’m down 5k on the year in my options account, but I just checked the corn account I throw some money into every now and then and it’s up 250%.
Doesn’t mean they’re truly worth it. It’s called speculation.
Last time they dumped hard on earnings, then immediately dip got bought. not saying it's gonna do that again, but something to think about.
yeah but the excitement of making 300% in 5 years aint shit compared to 300% in 5 hours

Chinese real estate developers have used off-balance-sheet vehicles to borrow money. Nearly every developer has borrowings in disguise.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-lies-beneath-hidden-debt-fears-feed-chinas-property-woes-2021-10-20/](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-lies-beneath-hidden-debt-fears-feed-chinas-property-woes-2021-10-20/)

"Nearly  every developer has borrowings in disguise. The sector's debt problem  is worse than what you see," said He Siwei, attorney at Hui Ye Law Firm. Chinese  developers owed 33.5 trillion yuan ($5.24 trillion)through various  channels at the end of June, Nomura estimates, based on official  statistics, adding "there are definitely other obscure financing  channels yet to be covered." Private bonds issued by shell companies in offshore locations have emerged as a new concern. In a note this month, Fitch ratings agency said that Fantasia Holdings Group (1777.HK),  a property developer which has since defaulted, had recently told it  "for the first time" that it had $150 million of private bonds that do  not appear to have been reported in its financial statements. Fantasia  did not respond to a request for comment. The company had over $4  billion worth of cash at the end of June and two weeks before it  defaulted said that it had "ample capital".

It’s going to trade sideways for the rest of the year.

They've gathered enough information to formalize a report that company xyz is (most likely) fraudulent reporting statements or is conducting activities/selling products are deemed unsafe(see link) and is going to short their stock before they release their report on the company and make some money.

TSLA not being able to deliver on demand is a huge problem. Demand will just go elsewhere and TSLA will lose market share and consumer sentiment will favor competitors. Competition is catching up quickly! And people aren‚Äôt buying new car every year like they do with smartphones. They‚Äôre losing out massively.
Obviously, to say it‚Äôs worth the same much 2 years ago as it is now is the silly part. These are some bags I can live with.

Yea. Beat on EPS and revenue. Dropped guidance on gross profit. To me it was an overreaction and will probably at least retrace to $52 without news. They have a new chip with incredible speed tests and are building two new plants. 

To me it‚Äôs a near term at the money options play and a long term massive win if they execute what isn‚Äôt even a turn around but a reinvestment in themselves to dominate the chip market.

foure months taper instead of 8. 2 rate hike for 2022. Speak of inflation in scary terms. Admit the fed is a failed institution. Powell to stepp down in JAN or FEB whenever time up

I currently have NOV 26 325s that I'm up on and holding. Planning to open up some new positions with these profits. Probably EOY 335 or 340c. Maybe a fraction in 350c for extra yolo
Not enough it deserve a 50% drop IMO.  Just seems like they missed expectations and said they more people are focused on jobs at the moment than education, but Europe showing growth.  Also I read something about the company doing a buy back this week.
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/roaring_alpaca** bet **CLOV** goes from **7.65** to **9.0** before **2021-11-10 04:17:32.455724-04:00**
I sold TSLA at 900 to buy other stuff (including Zillow $ZG). 

Thinking about buying more ABBV calls, so buy puts if you want easy money.

It's more a question of what calls can do for you quarter to quarter. There is your triple up if you can stomach the drawdown.
Just go for a run

Well yeah that‚Äôs why people love drugs. But I was just joking bud. Look, I went through severe depression from 21-28~ so I totally understand where you‚Äôre at right now. There‚Äôs really nothing I can say besides it just gets better. It really does. I know it‚Äôs cliche and right now everything seems hopeless and stupid to say something so generic, but I absolutely PROMISE it gets so much better. Whatever your problems are, they tend to figure themselves out as time goes on. Don‚Äôt give up. If you ever need anyone to talk to I‚Äôm all ears.

Tesla is now ‚Äúworth‚Äù more than half of Apple‚Äôs $2.4 trillion valuation yet only generates 12.8% as much revenue. With profits of $3.5B Tesla earns 3.6% as much as Apple‚Äôs $94.5B profit take. Shareholders thinking this is Apple are going to learn about multiple compression.

Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

Cost averaging into Jan calls. $180 and $190 atm. I could see a scenario where baba elevators down to $120 if there's bad earnings and bad sentiment around singles day...but if that happens I'm taking a loan out on my house to buy stock. Charlie Munger doubled down at $148. Ray dalio, buffet, and charlie are all calling BS on the "china's gonna ruin their cash cow companies' theory.

Full bear case: Touches $110, comes back to around $160 near eoy.

To quote you " Still profiting off of those who wander by and don't know what they're getting into. It's an easy game to play if you know how to play it. That's for sure.?" and I responded to that.  I went on to explain to you how the mods have consistently wrote and rewrote bots to battle PnDs and discourage the behavior you were accusing some small subset of this sub of doing..  No one cares if you joined this place at inception. You already said you were introduced back then and not apart of the community since and just recently stumbled here, so I was explaining to you why your preconceptions based on anecdotal evidence of sample size n=1 is not sufficient.

Nice of you to use your sample size of one friend to project onto all of us lol. In case you didn't know, pump and dumps (PnDs) are generally frowned upon here, and 95% of posts are deleted that are clear pump and dumps. The mods here have historically over the last few years done an amazing job.  To stay away from (PnDs), you can only talk about mid/large caps here, which can't be manipulated, and failure to adhere to these results results in a quick banned.

If you didn't know, we don't actually have taste buds for 'spicy', it's just that spicy foods have compounds in them (mostly a class of compounds called '[capsaicinoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin#Capsaicinoids)') that make the sensory systems that are involved in heat signaling more sensitive to being set off, so that even at room temperature it starts telling your brain that your mouth is hot. Exact same mechanism for why it burns if you get pepper oil in your eyes/nose, or if you apply capsaicin cream to your skin.

Most of your GI tract has little-to-no any sensory capabilities, but your anus does, so whatever capsaicin makes it to there without getting absorbed or degraded ends up interacting with your the heat-signaling nerve endings there, without feeling anything while it makes its way there through your GI tract.

End result: spicy butthole
Gtfo lol

FYI, even after you have a broker place a short options trade, you cannot manually adjust the bid, it must be broker adjusted. So if the bid at Monday morning open is .57, and you set it for .60 via the broker, you cannot quickly adjust it to get filled.

After loosing enough to buy a new car in trades and not using the funds I began to buy myself things I need with my gains from options. Laptop, nice headset. You definitely should buy yourself something nice so that money just doesn‚Äôt become fake and you start losing a couple of stacks and then just shrug it off.

Or is it the spice on your asshole that you're struggling with right now
Hey guys, I traded my PS5 for some $GME stocks from a kid at school.  I have the paper certificates.  I think I'm up big, but I don't know how to sell them.  Do you just sell these on eBay or craigslist?  Also, I didn't register them so do I still have to pay taxes?
The government would be even less productive than it is now. Compromise is how anything gets done in a democracy. Dude who is celebrated for being uncompromising is not going to be able to get anything done. Most significant thing I can imagine him doing is cancelling student debt, which TBF, would be a big deal for a lot of people, but significant enough to make large difference in SPY? Probably not.

Are you not paying attention to what is going on in China right now? So I don't have time (and frankly am not sober enough) to give a full econ lesson here but if the Chinese government doesn't intervene in the evergrande (and other failing real estate companies) situation credit restrictions will tighten globally. These tightened credit restrictions will lessen the amount of buyers in the market and consequently lower demand for both commercial and residential real estate. This lowered demand will drive housing prices down and anyone buying right now (even though interest rates are fantastic) won't be able to sell their house for what they paid until the next sellers market comes around (economy flushed with money, people stuck at home wanting to move, fed maintaining lower interest rates). Basically if you don't want to die in the house you're buying don't buy right now.

ReAl eStaTE OnLy gOeS uP
"Political Economy can remain a science only so long as the class-struggle is latent or manifests itself only in isolated and sporadic phenomena. In France and in England the bourgeoisie had conquered political power. Thenceforth, the class-struggle, practically as well as theoretically, took on more and more outspoken and threatening forms. It sounded the knell of scientific economy.It was thenceforth no longer a question, whether this or that was true, but whether it was useful to capital or harmful, expedient or inexpedient, politically dangerous or not. In place of disinterested inquirers, there were hired prize fighters; in place of genuine scientific research, the bad conscience and the evil intent of apologetic."

Yeah I have the book of annual reports since '65. There are plenty of no-name success stories who have his returns or better, and haven't been at it as long / retired, prefer living private lives, etc. When you start at 11 and live until 90, you're going to do okay in the markets. I'm interested in people who start at 25, wipe out 2 or 3 times (or not), and have retirement money by 35. I'm under the impression that most people could do that, but won't take the risk.
They'll be too busy celebrating their party's victories

Markets are clearly fragile. People ready to head for the exits on moments notice. The signs of a bubble are everywhere. Who knows when it will pop. It‚Äôs pretty much in the fed‚Äôs hands.
Completely agree with you only the difference between now and the 70s is the huge amount of federal debt. If the average interest rate of treasuries went up to just like 3.5% all of the tax revenue would be needed just to cover the interest payments. They can't ever let them float that high again without significant changes.

If you want a real analysis.  Republicans winning this election cycle means moderate Dems are going to push back on the progressives to be closer to center, meaning less spending on the current bill (also less projected inflation).  I would bet on a red day tomorrow.

So here is what is gonna happen. We are finally going to oust the progressive wing of the Democratic Party out of office for good. Then the bipartisan infrastructure bill will pass as Pelosi is gonna pound some heads in the house to get the children to vote. Then Build Back Better plan will be axed and in 2022 the GOP will take the house and the senate will remain D. This will make Biden a lame duck president and it cause SPY to rocket up to 500.

OR they say nothing close to that and SPY still goes up

True. But I have no intention of paying bare minimum on my mortgage for 30 years. I'll eat ramen for years and double down on my payment if it means I save 10% in final cost. 

But also my income is guaranteed to double in the next 3 years. So what I can afford now will be easily manageable in the not too distant future.

Fuck the astros. That is all
pretty drunk and feeling bearish so ill tell you all a secret:

you can't keep money in cash or bonds because of guaranteed negative returns from low nominal rates + inflation

so TINA, everyone moves to equities

however, the earnings yield on equities is negative and the risk premia is nothing. at these valuations you are essentially guaranteed negative returns over the next decade. this giant run up over the last 18 months is, in fact, precisely the mechanism by which equities align their very low/negative expected returns with the negative expected returns of other asset classes: multiple expansion. 

every asset manager knows this but is forced to chase due to career risk. Everyone is balls deep in the market out of TINA and the fed put but is ready to sell everything at the drop of a hat given any reason at all

and we are tightening into a slowdown üêª

That is a good question. I don't know how long you been in the market, but historically bbby was a side bitch to gme and amc, possibly because there is an etf certain people like to short that has these basket of these plus a few other stocks in it.  So they tend to move in correlation and gamma/short squeeze off each other to some extent, at least in a few instances since January 2021.  gme and amc were already pumping before bbby earnings even.  It is tough to say how this will play out since none of these meme stocks are nearly as shorted as they were before January 2021.  I have no positions in any of these meme stocks, but I do hope to ride a wave up and then down tomorrow and use a few days trades in the process.

I think Zillo is the strongest of them and that's why they stopped their buying program. They can afford the loss and can wait it out to get in when the getting is good. Open door et al. can't. If they stop buying they're dead in the water and will have zero income.

Lou Pai was a ceo of a division of Enron.

He knocked up a stripper which led to his wife divorcing him. To settle the divorce, he was forced to sell his shares/options in Enron worth about $250 million right before Enron crashed.

Unlike other executives, He never faced criminal charges, because prosecutors could not argue that he sold shares due to insider knowledge ‚Äî he had an ironclad alibi ‚Äî He was forced by the courts to sell.

He went on to become one of the largest landowners in Colorado after marrying his stripper mistress.

Edit: another lesson, this is the best possible outcome of not using a condom with a stripper. Ymmv

Why do I feel markets gonne dump tommorw. Maybe its because everyone is so bullish right now. Feel like the feds gonne pull a fast one and the market's just gonne tank.ü§î
imagine owning BBBY weeklies cuz u was stupid enough to buy them. wake up a milliionaire tomorrow. fukkkkk
I think the opposite. I‚Äôm excepting a panic crash as everyone heads to the exit and then a slow, steady recovery when people realize the bulk of their revenue didnt come from the buying and flipping houses even when that was actually profitable
I couldn't care less if zillow drops so long as home prices drop with it. I have over a 20% down payment, renovation money, and very good credit waiting to go for when shit drops to a reasonable level. Been saving 40% of my income for this for over a year now.

Evergrande has another bond payment on Saturday, which will likely cause yet another ADR selloff if they cannot pay, especially in big names like BABA.

Here is a tip. The United States of America is currently running a coronavirus case count cover up. See chart.

https://twitter.com/NickytaLeb/status/1455746091194912771?s=20

In reality, the USA is currently is the same situation as Israel, before they did boosters.

Cdc is late on boosters and everyone is getting sick. Short all airlines into Q4. Short everything.

Whenever I get a package of plain M&amp;Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&amp;M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the ‚Äúloser,‚Äù and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&amp;M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3√ó5 card reading, ‚ÄúPlease use this M&amp;M for breeding purposes.‚Äù This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&amp;Ms. I consider this ‚Äúgrant money.‚Äù I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. There can be only one.

At least soccer has the self-awareness to realize it's boring and encourages everyone in the stands to get as drunk and rowdy as possible to entertain each other while the "game" finishes.

Baseball games are just a $200 fine for being a boring person and you get kicked out of the stadium for doing anything but sitting down and eating your $35 hotdog.
Steve Eisman's from 'Big Short' was absolutely 100% correct about Zillow short

the only problem it was in August 2019 when Zillow was $40 a share

Moo?
Smart people only: Take on $OPEN

Take A: Bullish: Zillow permanently suspends home buying/selling, which $OPEN has specialized in since 2014, meaning their biggest competitor is gone

Take B: Bearish: Zillow permanently suspending home buying/selling shows it's a shitty business, and $OPEN will ultimately fail as well
Some of these comments are harsh but also grounded in truth. Start focusing on yourself, making yourself into the best possible version, and never chase women, and you‚Äôll be golden. Stop worrying so much about it, it‚Äôll come.

I completely understand.  I had a Lucid call and sold for a 200 dollar profit 1 minute after open - when it mooned.  It started to dip slightly, so I sold, lol.  I could have made 20 k.

Can someone explain why GME and AMC still go up when people say "Short Squeeze." They're not even in the top 50 most shorted stocks anymore. And idiots still holding GME thinking a MOASS will happen and it will go to $100,000 a share
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

You should look at their buybacks, however. 1.7 billion market cap and they are buying back 400 million in shares for the rest of the fiscal year. They are then accelerating the repurchase program in future years. They are actually rewarding their shareholders unlike a lot of these garbage meme stocks.

I actually wouldn't buy it at those prices as an investment because I don't want my money tied up in them. It's a terrible company and I would need to see what they report in future Quarters before even considering them. 

I could see making a swing trade on them, though. Otherwise, I wouldn't waste time on them.

Also you‚Äôre a rube and you‚Äôve been taken in by snake oil salesmen. Use your capital someplace it will actually do some work.
If you're above 25K at the start of the day, you should be able to trade with unsettled funds with margin account. Check with your broker. If you're cash account, still can't trade with unsettled funds unfortunately.
You should answer that question first.
those are some of the most profitable companies in the world so makes sense

when I was a freshman in high school I was on the bus and there was this hot white girl with a fat ass sitting in the back. She was one of the most popular girls in school because she had big tits and was kind of a slut. She was wearing a sun dress and as she was walking up the isle to get off the bus she lost her balance and her ass rubbed right on my face for like 3 seconds. I wish I would've sniffed it and I hated myself for not having another chance but nonetheless it was one of greatest moments of my high school years.

Somewhere between Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas I had to fill my motorcycle with 88 octane after stopping at three stations in a row that's all they had.  I was nearing empty, and only filled halfway in hopes of quickly finding another station and topping up with 91 or better.  The bike started knocking hard after a few miles.

Still not sure about a specific exit strategy. I think I‚Äôm going to load up on a few more 26 strike, start selling around $27.50. Break even at ER should be around $26.50. I‚Äôm thinking the price could push up to around $30-$31. I‚Äôd like to vacate the position around that time.

No chance. Seems sweet describing it that way but that shit would get REAL OLD day 1.
Why DCA down unless you plan to sell lower than your initial price target? If the stock was undervalued when you bought it, no need to double down, just wait for it to hit your price target (unless news changed)
ohhh...the future is real and inevitable my friend.

I think it lost a lot of it's appeal to people now that there's high inflation that's being felt

Do you mean as a swing trade or as a value play? As a value play, I don't see the value at any price, really. iBuying was supposed to bring in 20+ billion/year according to management when it was introduced and it was a colossal failure.

GME, here we go.
Seriously I remember being 12 and having $20 and feeing like a goddamn sultan.
I feel that, but BBBY has enough short interest that a crashing market might actually cause some shorts to cover to meet margin calls given that BBBY isn't likely to fall with such an insane buyback. They might be over of the few stocks to close higher than an hour or so after open (after the assured morning dip as retail that can't sell in after hours cashes in on the gain from today).

So the brokers lock up all the shares at 8pm EST... then when they open the vault in the morning, the prices have all changed.  Who are these night elves that rewrite the numbers?  How are these values established?  Where are people trading to set overnight prices?
Zillow almost hit $200 in Feb, the chart is a classic bubble when you zoom out past a year.  Some bears made cash betting against that.  One by one Covid stocks are dying. ZM, PTON, CHGG‚Ä¶CVNA and DASH could be next.

McAuliffe has closed on Youngkin quite a bit but by the looks of it, with 11% of the vote left and where the current spread is, he will need to capture at least 2/3 of all remaining votes. Looking at the counties where most of the remaining votes need to be counted and how the results there have played out so far, I don't see McAuliffe being able to achieve that and edge out over Youngkin.

I think the drop was an overreaction after the earning report. (delaying Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4, and underwhelming projections for Q4) All the problems I see with this company are with Blizzard (25% of the company). Activision and King (75% of the company) are doing just fine.

It may not go back up tomorrow but I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôll be back in the 80s in the next few months. Call of Duty has been the top selling video game in the US every single year from 2009 until 2020, minus 2013 and 2018 (the years when GTA 5 and RDR2 came out)
New Halo and Battlefield 2042 come out this year to give it competition, yet it‚Äôs still projected to be the top selling video game.

Activision is a money printer, especially in Q4. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be this low much longer. Hold and expect it to rise. But give it a few weeks/months.

Hot shower or a hot wet towel soak first. Scrub your face to exfoliate with soap and rinse. The hot water will soften the hairs and make them easier to cut/collect on the razor. Exfoliating will prevent dead skin from collecting in your pores. Now shave- try not to go over the same place more than once to prevent razor burn/irritation. Afterwards use an aftershave lotion. 

Now you don‚Äôt have to be a neck beard anymore. Good luck

The older style double edged safety razors are waaaaaay less irritating and easy to use. There are tons of YouTube guides on how to use them. The key is getting a high quality shaving cream. Also blades are dirt cheap.

IV got fucked quick. I bought a $190P for next week at $12.00 when the share price was $360. Then it jumped up. And up. And up. Got up to what $550 before it started coming down. I put in a sell at $14.50 hoping to get lucky. At $400 share price, it filled. That‚Äôs right, $40 more than when I paid $12. Then, it dropped down to $330ish about 15 mins later and was worth about $7 on the options. IV fucked it fast and hard, and I got lucky. Always damn risky playing stuff that shoots up super fast.
One day I will be an armchair philosopher , one day this philosopher will afford an armchair.

Get you a Gillette FusionPower and some Edge gel for sensitive skin.  Gillette has a bunch of youtube vids.  They still make their male employees shave at work in a half-transparent mirror with a camera behind it; they have been reviewing those videos so damn long there is literally nothing they don't know about men's shaving.

The Fusion cartridge is literally foolproof - you can't F it up.  The power feature makes shaving totally effortless.

I've been watching it for weeks now, RSI was high as fuck and I thought post earnings put would be a nice easy play. So today after climbing $175 to \~$200 I put $2k in at $200 1/22 puts.

Two minutes later the stocks up to $230. Fuck. Odd maybe will return to $200, I'll wait a minute. Stocks at $300. Halted. $350 halted. I'm at -$700 in about 7 minutes.

If it wasn't for playing GME, I wouldnt have kept cool knowing implied volatility was on my side for a brief moment. Put a sell order at $100 over my price average.

$350&gt; $300 dip, my puts fill, just in time as the stock is frozen before shooting up to $550.

Tldr; know when to stay cool and get the fuck out of a position.

That is a mathematically best case scenario.  You have to be willing to roll out and what not in months like september or get stuck bagholding for a while. It is a lot trickier then you might think to maneuver these situations.  All can still go well as long as the bull market is maintained for your ticker, but you certainly won't 12x.  3x is a realistic best case scenario.

tbh i bet it's in december. I was looking into it, i don't think the fed has ever raised rates or tapered in November. (def not in the last 10 years) it's almost always in december.
It‚Äôs a good choice bro look at the chart darn near all time lows but on an up trend. Too many big name players own there stock and have taken losses. If we can put the press on them for a day and volume gets to 10 million by noon it‚Äôs money.

Your problem is that you‚Äôre comparing Fisker to Lucid, the latter of which is proving to be a formidable up and comer. Fisker failed once already, and their attempt at making a comeback via a SPAC is nothing more than a laughable attempt at taking advantage of retail traders‚Äô insatiable demand for SPACs. Fisker is trash.

Yeah definitely sucks. My $30c for JAN are down like 70% and no hope of surviving, probably down $4k on those.

But I'm holding my shares. Literally every move was right (paying down debt, refinancing for lower rate + longer term, expanding line of credit, new sectors they are targeting) and yet the stock couldn't do anything but pump and sell off immediately.

Meanwhile garbage overpriced shit like TSLA, NVDA, NET trade at a ludicrous premium, years and years of growth already priced in, yet they go up 5% a day, every day.

I had this happen in the same percentages (granted far less money) on TSLA last tuesday at open within a minute of buying the calls i was down 40%, i hovered that sell button considering it but it bounced back and higher within another 15.    


I guess what im saying is that the immediate loss always feels like it can come back by holding on for longer cause you never know what will happen.   I'll probably be burned hard by this in the future....

Have you factored in the taxes on the gains? You might be even worse than you think!
Dude cars used to not have seatbelts that was an option. Then airbags came out that was an option. Now all that shit is standard. If they make self driving the law the cars will cost more. There‚Äôs no free lunch except at moms.
Early next year? 99.9% chance jpow announces the start of tapering tomorrow

so all the 10s of thousands of people dying each year while some people use the tech is just fine.. think about the young girl who was killed by henry ruggs last night. think about my friend that got ran over by a drunk driver and died. this shit is preventable and waiting years and making it exclusive is kinda fucked.

it'll take a long time for full adoption given how not everyone can just upgrade their cars. But we should do more to prevent the leading cause of death of people aged 1-54...

Who am i kidding. i still want to be able to drive even if people die. i like driving. In the future everyone should have a breathaalyzer so if they are drunk they are forced to full self drive LOL 

still be driving deaths but atleast not due to drunks

The play is based on OCGN getting approval from WHO, and the momentum/hype up to, a decision might come as early as tomorrow or the day after, get up early and if no decision yet, then yes, shares premarket before it goes up, currently at $15, it‚Äôs gonna be a bumpy ride, so buckle up, if decision is delayed or negative it will plummet, is approved it‚Äôs gonna fly, volatile and risky, not financial advice, do your own research.

GME and AMC to 0
Remember when SPY hit 428 last month? Yeah, it‚Äôs now at 460. Shut the fuck up bears you had your 2 weeks

1/22 SPY 500c
So many better, safer options. And unless the $1,000+ share pipe dream comes true, equal or better profits are out there.

I‚Äôll never touch GME again. I‚Äôll gladly forgo whatever profits could have been gained.
Let‚Äôs talk about Facebook. Did it really dip today because of the face recognition software? I guess it wasn‚Äôt that much of a dip. But after already losing 10k on retarded trades that‚Äôs the last thing I needed

typical
Tesla: We will be offering $10 Billion in new shares.

-----

/r/investing : I bought TSLA at $1200 and I will be holding for the next 50 years. Rest of my money is in VOO.

-----

/r/options : Put pricing still looks good. Will probably try to sell some. Buying calls may be risky but lots of upside with institutional volume. Hedge your longs and stay away from low delta.

-----

/r/stocks : I've been investing for only 6 months and I am up 30% on my portfolio. All my portfolio is in tech. Did I mention I'm only 18?

/r/wallstreetbets : I will gargle my own piss and drink Lord Elon's cum if TSLA hits $1500 by end of week. Fuck me in my tight mouth daddy!

Literal scam‚Ä¶.

My car autoparks, it pulls out of parking spots and drives to me in parking lots. When I‚Äôm on the freeway, it changes lanes and switches freeways for me. It makes me take back over on surface roads. 

It‚Äôs a software feature set that they sell as an add on. They are promising to bring more functionality to surface roads too. It‚Äôs not yet a full self driving car but if you get on the freeway, it really does it all.

It may not be worth 10k but it‚Äôs not a scam.

No one ever went broke taking profits. That $200 could have been $0. And then that $0 could have been another $500 just to ‚Äúmake it back‚Äù. Then you‚Äôre giving $5 BJs behind a Wendy‚Äôs. 

If you were only so unlucky to triple that $200 8 times in a row you‚Äôd have $1.3M.

You'd think the youth would rise up,  and vote for candidates they can relate to. But nope...

Dang
Only like half of that $2000 monthly payment is principle, if not less. Once you start properly accounting for maintenance and upkeep another half of that $1k is gone. 100% occupancy isn't feasible so take another slice off that for the month or so a year it sits vacant. So more like 5% return on $100k down while being on the hook for $400k. Might also want to read about tenant rights in California

I agree a house is good, one at least since you need a roof over your head no matter what, but anything beyond one is a gamble in which is better because stonks can easily have higher returns and zero upkeep which is good for lazy retards such as myself

&gt; constitutional amendment to create a state right to growing, raising, harvesting, and producing food, as long as an individual does not commit trespassing, theft, poaching, or abuses to private land, public land, or natural resources. 

I think the judge would argue that human lives are under the natural resource category or human meat is not under the food category or something like that in order to constitutionally justify saying no cannibalism. But if we had a really cool charismatic cannibal to stand up to them, like Tony Stark telling the Senate they can't have his suit except with cannibalism, it's definitely arguable whether this amendment does indeed protect cannibals.

If I were to win enough at the casino, I would like to buy a quiet farm and never look at a phone or computer again.... Or the color red

Okay. Why
Well I‚Äôm around but they have their own fields they are studying and to be quite frank I know nothing about it. It‚Äôs more hands on. I prefer computer science and computer screens and internet memes and le Reddit karma harvesting
Wait can they not detect bold letters or something?
That‚Äôs heroine. Works just as well.

You take the blue pill...the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill...you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Not allowed to say faggot?
2020 called, they want their pump and dump back
Why? What the fuck?
this is literally the only reason. i dunno why yall keep thinking there's some deep reason they pump.
If you ever think you made a retarded trade, just come here and look at the ban bets. My god y‚Äôall need special helmets

Where are the shares going to come from though to lower the price if most of the float is locked up at Computershare. Vanguard, Fidelity, and Blackrock have a decent amount but they have to keep enough on hand to meet needs. With VW there was just one entity shorts could get shares from so soon as Porsche decided to sell the price fell. Problem here is to many individuals combined with the fact that they can't quickly sell shares even if they wanted to.
Yeah i lost money lol. Forgot about my SPY put
Fuckin moon
People are sick of this pussy culture.
Sold all my SNDL for same reason
Guys so Carvana is now doing the same thing Zillow has been doing, they are buying cars with cash offers without due diligence pay for tow trucks to your house and pick your car up. Basically exactly as the failed Zillow model with houses. 

Sure cars are more liquid but could this be a short of the year? If Carvana shows signs of losing money in this segment puts will print.

The company said its partner Allseas acquired ship "as her configuration is well-suited for modifications that will enable the deployment at sea of a 4.5 kilometer-long riser to bring polymetallic nodules up from the seafloor."

Buy the dip/hold. You already know.
Said it before and say it again SOFI
Honestly? The market is fucked dude lmao ATVI retained AMUs from Q3 last year even with reopenings. Missed on revenue by $200m, likely due to the internet campaigns for people to stop buying cod points/skins. Vanguard released this Friday, with likely high sales numbers released next week....I think I'm going to double down on monthlies tomorrow morning
Then buy a strangle...but of course you dont know its going to move....people say stuff like that but don't have the guts to act on it.
Wait a minute, we‚Äôre not in school anymore!

I'm so proud of Maine. A few years ago a ballot initiative amended the state Constitution to make growing and selling and smoking weed a Constitutional right, and this year we noticed that the state Constitution doesn't say anything about food, and it's kinda fucked up for the weed harvest to be constitutionally protected but not the food harvest. So as of tonight, we have officially legalized food. The vote is currently 62% to 38% in favor of food.

Such a beautiful story, the state that got high and got the munchies while realizing the profound truths of life

Edit - slight mistake, there was the vote to legalize weed before the vote to make growing food a right, but the vote to legalize weed wasn't a Constitutional amendment like I thought for some reason, just the food one

No fap k?
It's crazy to read stories that people just chalk up to iNfLaTiOn. You strip these stories down to fundamentals and see the luxury the old had. A father of 4 working alone as a garbage man/shoe shiner/vacuum salesman could afford a new house, new car, and put food on the table no problem. People were able to pay for their state university tuition **and** housing off literally working at fucking McDonald's.


These sound like stories that are centuries old, but they're not. In fact, those that lived them currently run the country.
U might be into something, might just do that.
This guy fucks..... up portfolios.

I meant that as a suggestion for anyone. But ok.

Rivian is gonna go Public next week with $55B valuation at a price between 57-62$. I think with the hyper with TSLA lately Rivian can go crazy on public day but on the other hands IPO is never good on the first 2 weeks...except $HOOD.

The call was not good. Basically said they won't be profitable again until Q3 and have to eliminate 50% of jobs on the home end. Plus, there's a ton of purchases in progress that are gonna assassinate investor cash.

Cathie Wood isn't even beating Cathie Wood this year
Sort of‚Ä¶ all the losses can be carried forward but only $3k can be used again none investment income. 

So it‚Äôs more like lose 200k in year 1, write off 3k against your income. Make 150k in the market the next year and don‚Äôt pay any taxes on it. Continue to carry your remaining 47k loss forward to future years.

What did Cathie Hard Wood trade today ?
They purposely paid too much for homes to build market share to become profitable down the line and with the belief that homes prices were going to continue to rise within the immediate future. Things didn‚Äôt work out. I think investors started not being comfortable with the risk. I think their strategy might still have paid off

Normally we see this many users during market hours. It's been forever since we had this many in the evening.
If it‚Äôs for strength on the main lifts. Try teasing higher weights slowly.  Say you bench 200 for 5 normally. Slip in 215 for 3 reps next work out. Or do a single 220.
Are December puts on car the play?
You switch routine or add 2.5lbs.
I‚Äôd suggest consuming more protein (at least 1.6g per kg of body weight) and making sure that you‚Äôre pushing yourself when you lift while also allowing yourself enough time to recover. You need to find the right balance between these two factors and I can‚Äôt stress that enough. Otherwise make sure that you‚Äôre getting enough sleep and stay hydrated during your workouts. Just curious, how much are you lifting as of right now?

I went shopping at Target because everyone is always making fun of me for grocery shopping at Walmart and to check out possible hot moms instead of slobs and the only taco seasoning they had was $2.99. Walmart sells them for $0.97. Will never go back
So what's the thoughts on car tomorow? What's everyone predicting
Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if ark was the one buying this morning.
[deleted]
Bought 100 shares of Zillow at 76.26 1 sec before AH closed because I felt bad
This is probably the easiest bet in history
roku reports earnings tomorrow  would be nice to see it run back up to $490.  would also be nice to see them work out the deal with amazon prime and youtube tv

Short Z into bankruptcy
I think it is. The difficulty is everyone realizing that far more than just pulling back on bond purchases needs to happen because this shit isn‚Äôt sustainable. The stock market, housing market, car market, transportation infrastructure, fucking everything man. 

Everything points towards there needing to be a big change announcement, which would fuck the market. 

Fear of what you know should be there, hypothetically could be there, but probably won‚Äôt be there, is no less real. 

If what needs to be done was done, the economy would fucking bleed out tomorrow. 

What if‚Ä¶ what if‚Ä¶ it did?

That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs still hesitation to make sure before throwing all your money back in the ponzi current.

Any news or reason why?

Visualmod should be required to disclose their robo-trades and should self-ban if in the red
the rich do

imagine the nasdaq cratering 90% like it did in 2000 and these fuks like nancy pelosi lose their shirts

they own all the assets, if the market crashed, believe me they are gonna be hurting hard, you might lose a few thousand, theyll be losing millions / billions

remember march 2020? it was the rich who were panicking, the rest of us didnt give much of a shit, i was in WSB at the time, this sub was jacked to the tits in puts and having a good time

the last recession wasn't like previous ones because the fed printed a lot of money to keep the rich insulated from their bad decisions

Well, if it's "soon" like the spending bill, probably not anytime soon
So you not see the elder badge? I was on GME since $12 last year. Did a few DD on it too.
You guys see u/cashflow_ is back?
Ya if they remove em, the scars they leave are huge.
Agree in terms of actual impact but I think it's may help the public realize how crazy it's become.

Who knows though maybe it keeps getting even more absurd.
How many days have we been green in a row on SPY? What is the most historically?
CHGG if u like money
Yup, $25-28
Cardboard houses here! Get your cardboard house folks! they are going fast! Its the Year 2023 Bread and Milk cost $100+  everyone needs a cardboard house! Zillow will put you in the perfect home.

I‚Äôll definitely be checking BBBY tomorrow to see what happens, there are some conflicting indicators but it has tons more room to run up in the next few days for sure. 

And don‚Äôt worry about missing big moves like that, happens to all of us. I was sitting on CRSR 35 calls when it was at ~25 that had a few months out on them, before I sold for a loss. Ran up more than 100% quickly after that.

They were "supposedly" priced in 2000 as well, and also took like 6 months for the full breakdown to happen. No way of telling for sure how overleveraged the average institution is unfortunately. Obviously margin is at all time highs, but going to be difficult recreating yields through fixed income and while cash may be slightly more expensive, there's just a fuckton of cash on the sidelines waiting to buy. Market won't be on easy (since earnings will force reality as they have been this season on stupid runners), but there are still great companies you can buy that are much more attractive than your average US bill.

If democrats took inflation more seriously i think manchin would be more on board. His state is poor (west Virginia) inflation hits his people hard.

I was so close to selling them at close too man. Ngl, if I had exited at close today, I don't think I could play options any longer.

But yea scaling out 150 and riding out 40 contracts till expiration. think it has more legs (but most likely next week). I'm already deep itm so thetas not gonna be a problem thankfully

Idk I feel like options are actually less risky

I've lost my ass on shares and options, but at least options have a quantifiable risk and understood make-or-break
Was a great play either way, extra props to holding weeklies after being up that much on them. I‚Äôd personally hold at least a few of those because it looks like it‚Äôs bull flagging pretty hard AH- could definitely test the last top it had at $45. Wouldn‚Äôt even be ATHs either.
Just passed spac price again so with a good launch I‚Äôm hoping for $18+ and may just exercise the option

" French bank BNP Paribas has suspended three of its funds on Thursday as problems in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector are preventing it from calculating their value.  
BNP Paribas Investment Partners said in a statement that the decision affected its Parvest Dynamic ABS, BNP Paribas ABS Euribor and BNP Paribas ABS Eonia funds.  
It said the valuation of the funds would resume a soon as liquidity returned to the market and added that in the continued absence of liquidity, additional information on the envisaged measures would be communicated to investors within a month."

Had an interview with them in a hot market. Recruiter could only interview me a few weeks later. Told them I have 12 other interviews why the fuck would I wait?

Ended up eventually doing the interview. One of the first things they say is the salary is ___ and non-negotiable. Fair offer, but still below the ballpark of what I was getting. I ended the interview right there. Waste of time. 


Can really get a sense of how shit the company is by their recruiting.

Yeah but they launched the program in Feb 2021. It was already inflated at that time. Timing and poor technology was a recipe for disaster.

But only 2% up since beginning of September.

Will exit at the first sign of a pump, dump or flat tomorrow. So I'm getting the fuck out is what I'm saying
LMAO
thnx bro. somewhere around that range is what i'm thinking too. I just got insanely lucky. I felt like it was undervalued with how things popped off lately. I knew a bounce was coming but was expecting a move to 20 at best lol
Jim liked it so I got hella skeptical.
Have you tried not doing options?
You can thank Tesla for that lol
NEGG sympathy play????
it doesn't matter. market dont give af about tapering, and never has. the only thing it effects is the bond market.
&gt; I think the market is very uncertain about what will happen tomorrow. The markets are pricing in a high probability for a rate hike but it's not certain and they don't know exactly how much of an increase there will be or if there even WILL BE one
Tesla at 200 to rise up again sounds good
Anyone else get ASSBLASTED by Zillow today? I‚Äôm holding a bag of shares only.
Basically, the market thinks it knows EXACTLY  what the Fed is gonna do and say tomorrow.

If that scenario doesn't happen...it's not priced in.

The question you need to ask yourself is do you think the markets know what's gonna happen to a T?

How does ROKU do tomorrow? Guesses? ü§îü§îü§î
When easy money makes for difficult outcomes:  As the Federal Open Market Committee gets set to deliver its policy decision tomorrow, stubbornly persistent inflation continues to gum up the works. Year-over-year growth in the Consumer Price index and Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index each remain near multi-decade highs.  Such moves have proven increasingly broad based, as the trimmed mean CPI and PCE rates (which exclude extreme readings in either direction) prepared by the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and Dallas, respectively, each registered at their hottest since the financial crisis. Wage pressures are likewise percolating, as the employment cost index rose 1.3% sequentially in the third quarter, the largest three-month gain on record going back to 2001.    
Those data have opened a yawning chasm between current monetary policy and some traditional guideposts. According to Stanford economist John Taylor‚Äôs eponymous rule of thumb, current conditions call for benchmark interest rates of 8.52%, the finance blog Confounded Interest noted yesterday.

Welp.
yep. can't prove it but theres def a lot of very suspicious stuff.
I have not. How does this lose me money?
So does Zillow keep tanking tomorrow? Looks like there‚Äôs still plenty of room to slide.
Exactly it did and left many bagholders

All this year how many times gme reached all time high? 

Same is the case for amc. I am using logic here
The fed has telegraphed tapering clearly last two meetings
No. Wait until it goes up another 69% and then buy

The Terran one was trash. I couldn't get through it because it was so bad. Granted, brood war set the bar high, but they didn't even aim for the mark.

Uhh
I just don‚Äôt like to do puts in this clown market
My friend who is a car collector was bragging to me for an hour how much his cars went up in value due to the car shortage right now. 

I showed him that if he just put that value in SPY he would have made 100x the money with 0 time spent on maintenance and storage for all these cars. 

He was not amused.

Shrooms was great! I haven‚Äôt seen that in a long time. Definitely a fun movie.

They have a big business on supply chain management. A big problem right now, also not affected by inflation.
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie, BBBY
I bought calls after the big drop.  It continued to drop.  I cut my losses and ran.  Shares might be worth it that you can hold until they announce a big juicy government contract worth billions

Perhaps I don‚Äôt understand what an etf has to do with corrupt society, and it‚Äôs not people yoloing shares before a high risk event.

As far as I understand it, again I‚Äôm a tard
Fish if you had puts. Strip club if you had calls.
Jerk off in your roommates burrito!
They sold it in what, 6 parts? The campaign was godawful. Their writers have gone full trash and haven't recovered. It's a shame since brood war was so good. Whatever I think about the art direction is kind of irrelevant. At least the mechanics were good, which makes for good online gameplay. Diablo 3 had the same issue until the expansion. They went from grimdark fleshed out lore to full on mustache twisting, chaotic stupid villain.
It's stuck on a freighter off LA.  I had to build my own.  Slow bleed down to 458.12 until JPow announces no tapering until 2022.  AH it jumps to 468.41
Why

No time for calls, all in shares!
I‚Äôm bullish on it too but the it‚Äôs overvalued. I think a reasonable PE is 20, but that puts them at around $80 a share assuming they can get an average eps of $1 per quarter. The expectations are just stupid high in general

I‚Äôd highly recommend it. It‚Äôs dated, and it is corny, no pun intended, but IMO if you get yourself into it it‚Äôs actually a decent horror movie. 

If you don‚Äôt get yourself into it, it‚Äôs fucking *hilarious*, so it‚Äôs worth a watch either way. Get *really* baked if you smoke weed. 

The opening scene is really well done, and really creepy. Most effective ‚Äúscary‚Äù part imo. Gave me nightmares as a kid.
Every 5 minutes on CNN: "Too Close to Call"

Aight. Why don't you tell me when it's not too close to call?
OCGN has approval tomorrow and 50% shorted = will go up 400% next gme
I actually bought and closed my first call the other day. I want to get into short term calls and puts after I learn a bit more. What did you mean by that though about SPY and VIX?
It's getting propped up hard. The 100s of flight cancelations, pilot picketing, and poor earnings make me think that it's being propped up. But for how long? The stock simply has been bleeding for months.

I bet he started some focus group to change the name because FaceBook just reminds people that it started as a semi-date rape college douche tool.  So, said focus group is tasked with taking FB "beyond" which is what "meta" means, literally.  So, the focus group keeps trying to come up with meta FB and they start calling it that.  When it comes time to actually present results they don't have shit until someone just suggests they roll with Meta.  Zuck can't process that humans will laugh and mock this suggestion, so he's all in.

So why say they "sold a fuckton of great games"? I think a lot of people are in the same boat as I am. Most people only buy those franchise games out of habit anymore. It's the only reason why the negative press has any sway at all. They don't have the staying power they used to. If they were at all concerned with their art, fans would be more forgiving. They don't care about their US customers anymore, though. They care about playing grabass *instead* of making great games. The endless shovelware and microtransactions are the main cause. The catalyst is the negative press.
I'm up 26% for the month of Oct.  I only started with $10k but it's something.

Lol okay, maybe you were the one person who saw this coming. But you get my point right? These things seem obvious to everyone in hindsight but usually a tiny fraction of people are plugged in to see what is coming. We laugh at [pets.com](https://pets.com) but in 1999 it seemed like a good buy.

Gonna ride BBBY and milk it for as much as possible
you are way late
Hope it will be true.

Me who loses out on every single earnings play: ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)
I‚Äôm down
 üåΩüåΩüåΩüåΩüåΩüåΩ
I‚Äôm Too lazy to write an essay on it. But I bought puts
Yeah lol redfin and opendoor might be the next hit by flattening home prices.
Is PYPL ever gonna stop tanking yet?
I think there was a good amount of people talking about it, but it was being drowned out by Tsla and others. I didnt get in cus im usually wrong as fuck about earnings reports
[deleted]
Did that. It‚Äôs posted but doesn‚Äôt seem to be live

My gf just got her back blown out by a dude who bought BBBY before close
Are meme stocks a safe haven when corrections happen? Since they are solely driven by retail investors I can imagine them being a place to hold funds when the rest of the market is on a downtrend.
Crooked Nancy can drag deez nuts on her face
If we had a Market Irrationality index, it would be near ATH right now.
BBBY WTF
No they didn‚Äôt, they were expected 6 something dollars
The Sims redux
It was already widely reported then. July I think was the first flat month
if $BB goes above $20 tomorrow I will have at least one thing to be thankful of this thanksgiving
Let‚Äôs set it up!
Chegg might be a buy soon
If you don't mind me asking, could you go into starting salary ranges and such? I (barely) make six figs and am in middle management hell
I‚Äôm just bearish overall on SQ long term. Once rates go up I think Otto dump probably to around $50-60. Those strikes had decent volume so not too worried about liquidity
So zillow puts tomorrow?
NO. The volatility will be insane, at least paper trade it. Tomorrow could be amazingly volatile
Literally buying puts for Msft guh. Their cloud growth is massive and will only grow larger. Still lots of opportunities in the market for them. That being said I have absolutely no grasp of how it's valued and only trade on my feelings ü§°
IF YOU AIN'T BUYING \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ RIGHT NOW YOU MUST REALLY HATE MONEY ü§°
Yeah but did you forsee the home prices flattening in August?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
I might fail no nut November tomorrow.

Praise Allah
Bntx next week ...they will crush earnings
You can‚Äôt believe this? Is that sarcasm?
#AVIS $CAR will cause all other used car and rental car stocks to go up It‚Äôs like a fact. They were expected to post negative earnings and BEAT by $4.45 EPS. That is insane.
Is Nancy going to drag Elon into congress to explain what he did to her calls?
41 in december. that is all.
Canned Ham is fucking disgusting

Its going up ah before elon tweeted
What‚Äôs the logic on the $150p?
Lost all my money playing memes all year.   Decided to take a break til the holidays pass.  Memes take off.  Okay.
Honestly saw this coming for Zillow in august when home prices started flattening.
I sold 100% of my stock then
Insolvency
I hope Open Door goes next fuck that entire business model in the face
Hopefully tonight, and autistic in the other direction.

‚ÄúConsidering a stock split at $1500‚Äù.
Yeeeesh
Everyone is acting like this was clear to see, but it really wasn't, if it was everyone would've seen it coming during the good times.
Any thoughts on SKLZ earnings tomorrow?
As much as i want to clown world this one, nike‚Äôs parents makes sense to me in a way: 

‚ÄúIf you want to police your trademarks in that world, it‚Äôs going to be easier if you just own registrations for virtual goods,‚Äù he said. Gerben said the trademark filings will also add value to the overall brand portfolio as trademarks are a form of property.

Lost 50% of my portfolio today. Huge shoutout to u/teslaownersSV on Twitter. Most likely will go down as one of the worst tweets of ALL time yesterday tanking my beloved TSLA.
Feel bad for virginia roberts, one of girls trafficked by epstein. Can‚Äôt believe he use underage girls to lure some politician and blockmail them. Those girls are innocent
Splitty split
Probably just gonna sit and wait to see how the fed meeting goes
I‚Äôve bought said puts. Never been surer of something printing in my life

Can we legit plan this. Some kinda FB event maybe
Half the people here couldn't find Vegas.
All because that one guys tweeted and thanked Elon for making him rich. Elon is like, down you go, peasant

I know all of you are all part of Jim Cramer‚Äôs investment club, you‚Äôre all taking pics of the QR code and impatiently waiting for it to pop up on your tv screens‚ö†Ô∏è
true, but just OTM puts wouldve still printed so I dont see the problem

I say after buying 0 puts lol
Good enough dd for me why at close tomorrow and not am ?
buy back of shares. Swap baskets. Meme moons coming
Or it‚Äôs just over leveraged
It‚Äôs popped. Who knows which direction it goes from here.
Don't take this the wrong way but Puts on MSFT?

Really?
down for this üíØüíØ
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/aresev6 (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 750.0 when it was 804.99 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Memes up tomorrow and SPY dip so I can get the fk out of these puts
That would end up one of two ways.  A bunch of Social Awkward people afraid to interact or the Billionaires from Rat Race betting on everything.
I mean at the height. When they froze the program everyone who had a braincell knew something was up. I mean when things were going well.
Half the people here are either ugly or broke so bookers wouldn‚Äôt bat an eye
When‚Äôs the next autistic Elon tweet???
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/ravensgators (0/2) made a bet that LCID would go to 30.0 when it was 36.55 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Holy shit, $MIME was almost flat after-hours, then Cramer shilled it to a grandma a few minutes ago, and now it's up 3% after-hours. Poor grandma ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
I‚Äôve got a bunch of 260s for this week‚Ä¶. But I also am jacked to the tits in 150ps for 2023
Zillow is not a buy. Maybe wait till next year for them to recover.  It‚Äôs going to be a bloodbath unless miracle happens.
Z is gunna bleed for a while off this, or at least go sideways
Bulls must be pissed. Tesla could‚Äôve been $1,250-1350 by now if Elon didn‚Äôt tweet yesterday
The ones I remember are within the last month
They've been dropping like a rock for weeks. A lot of people saw this coming and they deserve to keep falling.
I could go the rest of my life without ever playing another WW2 game
Imagine all the thousands of first time homebuyers Zillow cheated out of their dream home by offering 20% above asking price. 

#GET FUCKING REKT NOW
Depends if you can reliably afford the payments. Even with market downturns property is usually a good investment long term (certainly better than renting for a decade)
TSLA calls

The anticipation of WHO approval will make the stock jump another dollar. If WHO approval happens (which ppl seem to think it will) you‚Äôre looking at insane gains on top of that.
I think it will bounce back but it has been hard to time it

How much you lost? You made me feel lucky with my tesla puts losses of 40%, 20% of my portfolio losses
I really didn't see any positive sentiment for Zillow the last few days. Just people wondering if a disastrous earnings would affect the stock price appropriately, given this regarded market. Keep your finger on the pulse of WSB's bunghole and you shall see.
Z and OPEN buy at open? What do you guys think. Only very briefly went over the fundamentals, I'm mostly just looking at the charts right now.
Everyone knew something was up when they froze their flipping program. How bad it was, probably not.
[deleted]
If Gme &gt; 400 I‚Äôm in
Any recent DD links boys üë¶
Probably.  It was either those or SAVA puts and I went with SAVA.
I just buy puts if market cap is over 50 billion. Doesn‚Äôt make sense but has worked pretty well.
I‚Äôm getting a call tomorrow for sure
Fb calls are alright but mine is dated for February. Long rope on my Jan atvi calls tho
Real estate is local ‚Ä¶ Zillow overconfident and didn‚Äôt do enough research

Sir, you said irrational, not ready to pop
As the real world has been pressed to its limits for capital and surplus value, capitalists have created a second world in which consumers will be able to purchase digital versions of the same goods and services. See [Nike](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/nike-is-quietly-preparing-for-the-metaverse-.html)
In August / before they froze their flipping program?
Theres been a bunch of bearishness on them and bad news was on the front page just yesterday
We hope.
And the shorts still need to be milked
Used to work for State Farm. Stupid is covered.  We had no less than 2 houses a year burn down from grease fires.  They always ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to turn the stove eye off before they walked the dog.
[deleted]
It could def moon more, has 30% short interest and AH buying seemed largely news based
IIRC there was some DD a few weeks ago that outline BBBY was in the top 5 most shorted stocks, way more than AMC.
Is that already being priced in today?
cathie wood special
Any hope for my SQ calls
Yeah because they paused their program. It was clear something was wrong. I mean during August when things seemed to be popping.
$ROPE.
There were multiple about them being underwater on their houses
![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
Lol
Yeah... seems ready to pop...
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I plan on. That‚Äôs why I bought them in the first place. They didn‚Äôt really get an earnings run up and have been beat down quite a bit compared to everyone else. Seems primed to get at least a bump out of earnings.
Might have to quit playing earnings for good. I didn‚Äôt realize it was even possible to be this unlucky.

Apple calls- fail.

Fb calls- fail.

Msft puts- fail.

Amzn calls- fail.

*as I proceed to try to time the market and will eventually sell when this shit hits $50*
It's a home so who cares? I bought in 2007 and was underwater for years and now I'm way up. I wouldn't waste time trying to time the housing market. If you're ready for a house, then get one. If not, keep throwing away money on rent.

Sounds fun in theory, but you know half the people here couldn't score at an orgy.
Elon you owe us. Tweet some bullish shit.
yeah. problem is there's now $100B or so stablecoins bouncing around that can't be used for anything other than buying corn. so there's sort of a permanent bid under these things now. I mean who knows but it's entirely possible they just keep printing and we go to 100k on pure scammery

Nah, already got my gains off that.

CHGG predictions this week?
Ouch. I bought 40 ford put contracts.  We can all be retarded together.
Looks like the end of times to me
There were a ton of bad news coming from them the past few days. Bloomberg put out the scoop about Z buying up houses to flip later. Now Z is selling those houses, a lot of them, for a loss. Of all stocks, you chose the super wrong one to average down lol.
Thats may 2020 right

I'm not being an ass, I lost over $21K on puts last month.

cod is the same game every year, with slight variations. Shovelware by definition.
Im buying my first home right now and we close in a couple of weeks. This Zillow News got me worried a bit. Feels like were def at the top of the housing market. Could take years for me to break even or turn a profit if I needed to sell and there is a downturn. I don‚Äôt see how these prices and trends can just keep mooning with no pullback.
Told myself I would go cash for the fomc meeting. Instead I bought a bunch of square calls yesterday like the moron I am. Why square? Because I like to get fucked in the ass, that‚Äôs why.

Keep an eye on it in the pre-market.
You're not going to be printing much with such overpriced contracts. You think the people selling you the puts don't know that it's absurdly valued? They have priced that in. When I last checked TSLA leap puts were like 30% of the underlying asset value. That is a big drop to break even at expiry (yes I know that we don't hold to expiry, but just for reference).

It's already under 1.2T market cap though and that's not a very ballsy prediction either..
Reminder that Cathie Wood owns $1 billion in Zillow with a cost average of $82.50.

She bought $25 million in SNAP at $59.17 and bought Chinese stocks all first half of 2021.

Her TDOC average is $163.81 ($151.29 now) and ZM average is $372.89 ($281.10 now.)

She is also moving ARK Capital from NYC to Tampa and calling this downgrade an innovative move.

Not to mention all the HOOD she‚Äôs bag holding.

Seems like the perfect time to hand out bags to a lot of bullish retailers. Or I dunno, I get shit wrong a lot.
New thing that was implemented, basically you bet what price the stock will go to before a certain date.
maybe long term zillow might be a buy it depends if they sell these homes at a loss or wait
I am willing to bet that TSLA will go back below a $1.2T market cap in the next 2+ years. in Feb this thing fell -40% in a month, a -50% drawdown would be $60k payday per contract. market can stay retarded for a long time but not forever
Can confirm the latter
Cause he is a POS
Well, best of luck considering you're 0/2
So sqqq calls

Yup! Basically someone went on a Starbucks break while the AI said ‚ÄúFUCK IT, LETS DO IT LIVE!‚Äù
No, the fucked up, plain and simple. Algorithm set price predictions for 6 months rather than 6 weeks. They overpaid for EVERYTHING by at least 15%. Company fucked.
Tesla today is very boring
Nah open door and Redfin are still buying and selling homes
They're Canadian so you can actually wash them.
Vanguard is a dumpster üî•
Its just to expensive. I normally like to have several calls to sell on the way up. Cleanspark up 80% on the month and still rated as undervalued.
Have puts on tesla but i aint happy. Its barely up. Tesla only down $50 from ath
"Real Estate only goes up" is not a meme in that market. In 2005 I lost a damn girlfriend (almost fiance) because I refused to buy a damn house and everyone she was talking to was like "oh he better buy one because they're only going up."   


It's one thing to buy stock or calls when stuff is extended like this because as long as the conditions for the run continue and you don't overleverage, you're good. Buying a house at +20% when the market is like this is the definition of overextended, though.
If you‚Äôre feeling bad, just remember someone bought $CAR at $545 today.

May as well. Nothing else will.
that's a LIE! They just want you to believe that.. The fed is actually currently purchasing CDO SWAPS from Zillow and other mortgage companies. Burry is short and he's never wrong
Also they used zestimates to buy them. üôÑ
It‚Äôs bullish for some reason. Idk how it doesn‚Äôt come back to screw us over.
It only seems obvious because it blew up, like subprime in 2008. Bet everyone here would be heavily buying the ADX if they were investing in 2007. It's only obvious in hindsight.
while CAR was crashing back to earth, SAVA quietly ripped and ended the day up 25%.........all the I've seen the last few weeks on yahoo are lawsuit ads by lawyers reminding ppl if they lost money in SAVA b/c of BS fud to call them.

now I see positive articles coming out saying it will probably pass FDA trials and go up 200X...

Just pick the one that gets spammed early, let us rise 5% and set your stop loss . Some days you make 50$ some days you make 500$ just depends on how much these noobs push the edge. This has worked for me 80% of the time in the past 6 months. When I got burned I just sold CCs till I was out of the hole.

/u/Jumpdeckchair (1/1) made a bet that AAPL would go to 154.0 when it was 149.36 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Tomorrow morning all in on BBBY.
They have trash field advantage
People are calling Zillow stupid, but rewind the clock, if the housing market was still spiraling they'd be fucking geniuses. All this stuff seems obvious in hindsight.
Nahhhh. It‚Äôs gonna get crushed tomorrow.
Can I have them, after you‚Äôre done wiping with them?
&gt; The stock market is not a zero-sum game.
Not really. They were buying homes with the hope of Californians moving in to buy them. They didn‚Äôt hedge against their massive failures
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/IDoLikeMyShishkebabs** bet **GME** goes from **218.9** to **250.0** before **2021-11-05 18:37:02.402860-04:00**

Damn gg my boy
So if a stock rips this hard AH (BBBY) what does it mean for regular market hours tomorrow?
If you've been stuck going sideways for the last 6 months, it is time to liquidate everything, start over, and get more concentrated into a few tickers that have momentum?  Long term slow gains are for my 401k.  Tired of getting no where over the last 6 months.

That's how it's been lately. All of the movement seems to happen right at the start of the day. Sometimes you get volatility in the middle or at power hour, but everything seems to be about positioning and hoping overnight right now which is like reeeeeeeee.

Please, god. It needs to. Not because I need a car. But because I‚Äôm in the industry. This insane rapid inflation, mostly due to the god damn rental companies, is strangling inventory and pricing cars outside of budget for actual customers.

Hedge fund Alphadyne Asset Management‚Äôs bad year is getting worse in a hurry.  


  
The macro strategy fund, which had $11 billion of assets at the start of last month, is down another 6.5% in October, bringing losses for the year to 17%, according to investor documents seen by Bloomberg. Without a dramatic turnaround, the New York-based firm is facing the possibility of ending the year down for the first time since starting in 2006.  
The firm joins peers such as Rokos Capital Management in losing money as bond markets whipsawed investors. Interest rate traders suffered heavy losses toward the end of last month as bond markets turned direction to factor in risks that central banks will raise interest rates faster than expected in response to spiraling inflation.   


  
Bets that the difference between the front-end of the Treasury yield curve and the long end would widen were hammered as a result. Though Alphadyne had reduced its position, it still held some bets that the Treasury curve would steepen. The fund‚Äôs October losses worsened last week from less than 2% through Oct. 22.

  
A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.

Great question I would also like to hear input on. I saw some fancy pants on the television talking about this being related to the Uber/Kroger deal and didn‚Äôt mention shorts covering, but the short interest was crazy high and there‚Äôs no way 80% in AH is all public interest right? Shorts covered their ass immediately and any further gains will be media driven, which could be significant. That‚Äôs my take but who knows

Unironically, if they cut a quarter of their staff and stick to online and advertising, they will probably become profitable again soon. Next 6 months, they will be getting money back from what they spent in purchases over the previous 6 months, returning billions in liquidity. 

The real question is "how much of their current valuation was counting on future profits from flipping houses?" If that was seen as a big future money maker, it will keep diving.
By open it‚Äôs already too late, I don‚Äôt care what anyone says. Last time I said this like 10 people gave me confirmation bias, I was down $2k that day as a broke college student. Given I was able to lose 2k, but fuck off

I was tracking GME more so than AMC but same thing, expected resistance at either 218 or 225 if we broke 208- easily broke through 218 in AH and hit 225. Now sitting back on 218. Should be a great day tomorrow if it opens around the same spot or higher.

Pretty sure that's the point. Shares locked up and difficult to sell/can't be loaned makes GME illiquid and volatile. Real question is whose locked in with who? The apes or the shorts.  Needs to be said that if shorts didn't close their positions in the past 10 months then they are the retards here not the apes.
Now Zillow gone have to be the beggar, lowering and lowering their asking price.

This and more, tomorrow!!
lmao I have nothing of value to share
If you were to start with 500$, which strategy would you choose?
Every time I fuck up, there was a plan in place, and I went against it.  NEED TO STICK TO THE PLAN
its definitely an overreaction, but essentially they lost their bet that housing prices would continue to rise, and they could fuck over the little guy with the lack of supply on the market. Fuck zillow. Their practices are shady. Might buy one day though.
So that AH pump on Z last Friday was real fake and gay now lol
Yes, they‚Äôve been saying that. Everyone knows that. This is nothing news as long as they don‚Äôt raise interest rates which they said they wouldn‚Äôt until middle of next year.

If they do raise interest rates the market is fucked but there‚Äôs a 99% chance they do not.

You should be okay. 28% of the float has been traded AH way above 20, so it's not like this is a low volume pump. Great job buying those 150 contracts. You deserve the win.
So I bought 100 shares at 28.45 for $BBBY. How fucked am I tomorrow morning?
Why?
Dude. No way you should give up your day job. You‚Äôll be trading stocks on an Obama phone in between servicing Johns behind the Wendy‚Äôs.

I‚Äôm ready for maximum pain tomorrow
Same thing happened to me. I‚Äôm calling Fidelity to see if they switch my SPY puts for Z puts.
Since January, yes.
To buy more TSLA shares.... ü§î
Anyone know why SPY is red . Seems like a crash since it‚Äôs always green
But it was trading at that price for long time
and its not even a good business model

theres a million ways to cheat online, charging for it will get you no where. If they focused on ads maybe idk
Wtf is with all these bots pumping OCGN?
Locked in 1000 7 nov 21 puts


Let‚Äôs print. 


Not gonna lie. Been playing calls then puts on this thing like it‚Äôs my job the past month. Working out well.
More OCGN. It's like a rollercoaster, but the bar is up.
Yeah the report was generally very good, and honestly ensuring quality releases *is* smart long term. From what I've seen D2R is suffering from bugginess and server issues after a presumably rushed release. I'll probably be buying more shares soon; gonna eye the trend for a bit cause every dip keeps dipping
Going Ape shit
Elon , please keep posting crappies of tsla, let me be a billionaire as you!
Why Tilray? Looks dead at the moment
Hahaha even with all the tech earnings causing gap downs, SPY can't stop making new ATH. 

Want to see how NET holds up but I'm thinking it pulls a TWLO and gets drilled

This market is just a giant pump and dump... Feels like another rug pull is just around the corner...

Zillow flew too close to the sun. Wanted to change the real estate game and it only played itself in the end
Me, that's insane for it to drop that much after it's already so low. I don't respect AH movements. For what, a few delays, and they raised their own forecast? sure it was beneath analyst expectations, but why are they the experts, not the company itself?
Wow you're at a pivotal point in life! Between living in a mansion or living under a bridge
I don't buy puts on memes unless it's earnings day, in which case I have a 100% success rate

Lol. I bought a singular Jan'22 $60 put on Zillow two months ago, just to see how they work. Im hindsight i should have bought more.
Bbby puts feel like a good idea tomorrow
They realized it takes 2 week to sell shares that have been DRS‚Äôd

Which means they can‚Äôt sell right now when they‚Äôve finally broke even

üíÄ

Downvotes won‚Äôt change the fact that literally none of you morons checked if you can sell.

Whoever came up with DRS is either a God-level troll or an absolute moron.
I have strike prices at 70 and 65. I lost 1k on BP calls today so I‚Äôm really hoping I crush that loss
Evergrande should hire Zillow to sell more houses
Look at BBBY lmao
Me too man. Should have known that pump this morning would fade immediately, smh

I'm apparently now a long term investor. Shares @ $30 and no hope of getting back to break even.

Good company, CEO is actually doing exactly what he needs to for future trajectory -- but getting absolutely DRILLED into earth's core every opportunity.

Fundamentally undervalued, while overpriced garbage like NET having absolutely no issues holding ATH after a 80% gain in a month... smh
Yeah I'm gonna exercise some 110s and just forget about them for 10 years

Of course there were. But even the winners stock prices went -80% and stayed there for almost a decade. Fisker might survive but it‚Äôs never going to get a crazy meme valuation like Tesla or Rivian because the bubble will pop before they get off the ground. If you‚Äôre holding for a decade it could still be a good investment if they make it.

I'm gonna sell my VXX shares to buy back my poor man's covered calls on TMUS. 

As soon as I press sell for them VXX shares, the market will go wild with Jerome and Apes and all that jazz. 

I'll be shook from the chaos and won't chase trades and just sit there, poor, and watch TMobile give back all the gains and realize I bought my calls back at the top.

Today was the first time I‚Äôve jumped onto some Tesla weeklies. Could‚Äôve done it any other day in the past week and made money but I chose today ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
BBBagholders coming outta the woodworks ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
If you yolod into  way oom calls on cars during breakfast you‚Äôd have been a millionaire by lunch time
üëÄ
Why? They have massive growth and tailwinds. RPA adoption is in its infancy
I grabbed 2 $210c and a few $250c.   


 Haven't played GME in months lol good timing but I'll bite my tongue so I don't jinx us on the overnight..
Literally everyone who bought last year
[deleted]
Thanks. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Got a single Zillow 2023 leap. Imma hold it for the lolz
You sad, sorry, worthless sacks of shit.
ATVI good buy for a quick trade sub 70?
Metaverse is getting weird
Why?
BBBY gonna go pull a CAR back to ATH's
Will amzn ever have a green day again or is too boomer now
Can you fuckin believe me, ME!? I sold my GME $205 calls before close for OCGN tomorrow.

So you better pay the fuck off OCGN
Reaching levels of retard I'd only seen in the meme stock subs.  They're leaking now I guess
Kroegers caused a domino effect where BBBY shorts got blown up and bled into AMC
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)*babe, but check out the zestimate on it*
Basically the ability for institutional shorting on the stock is going to get bottlenecked this month. They also will not allow investing in any MJ assets outside of those listed on major indexes.
My nascar stock play is up four cents. Lets go boys. Next year nascar is coming back hot.
yea clearly retail all got together to pump every meme stock at the same time today after hours ur pretty smart
zillow -&gt; zero
lol wow down vote because i said pick up more in Ah on AMC wtf ..... reallyy people
Y'all have your own subs for every ticker and still gotta ruin the dailys with this ticker spam.

At least say more than 1 word you tards
They are all basically the same stock so the big boys trade them all together and also IWM is a thing
Remember the other 2 low market caps. All of memes surging that in sec report
You know what would be really cool?  If  Paypal would go up.
BB patent sale being announced any day now. 

https://www.iam-media.com/finance/blackberry-patent-sale-80-close-price-agreed-frustration
I‚Äôve been watching it for the past few days. It‚Äôs been setting up for it. Trigger pull finally, today.
"It's a nice setup"
&gt; they are going to have a cash flow problem
Buy, hold or dump $PINS?
ATVI at 69.69 AH. That means you're fukt!
Bet this will end up being a fake pump on memes before jpow speaks then a epic rug pull leading to massive losses.

All because they want retail traders to get back to work.
Guy doesn't fuck around
wtf did Zillow get expect to happen when they over pay for a shitload of random houses? why didn‚Äôt I buy puts sooner
ATVI 69

Very nice.
What do they know that I don‚Äôt?
Well I found my balls to hold something risky over night. Here is to making it or losing my life life savings.
Y'all gotta stop calling every stock with movement a P&amp;D.
check out the chart and how similar the setup is to late april and into may. Based on that, you can see that we were due a run up to a new high, cool off for a week, and then the big move will likely come
VisualMod‚Äôs comments are savage.
It‚Äôs after hours fren
ATVI seems like such free money in the 60s. CoD is more popular than ever, and Blizzard's current woes seem overblown.
This Zillow earnings call is the Hindenburg of earnings calls.

'Yeah, we put hydrogen in our zeplin, but no one could have anticipated someone would light a cigarette. But uh.. yeah.. they all died. But that doesn't mean people won't want to ride on our other ships, they're totally safe.'
He also weirdly tolerates you fucktards
[deleted]
I expected much more ripping these AH
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
Yeah, it‚Äôs totally priced in to the almost 20b market cap.
Do not go against the juice. 17.52 11/19
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Afraid of a little blowie?
Lol, tell me what bags you have without telling me what bags you have.
lots of 5 year charts are whack rn, but Zillow does suck
Dear lord I hope so
Weeeee AMC calls. ATVI puts ü§ë
Clov is not happening friend
I bought some  bullshit GME FDs before close.  Figure the dummies might pump them enough for me to make a few bucks when I sell them tmrw
Take the fall for us all please these bags are hurting my arms
No it won‚Äôt. It really ran AH. You literally already missed. 

How do you idiots fall for this shit EVERY time? You either bought today or you didn‚Äôt.
They need a Zillow fire sale page because I'm interested
&gt; Yes, you do.
Dead
Gamestonk
Damn SPY, u scary
Congrats retard!
There were still winners in dotcom bubble, it‚Äôs not going to be just TSLA and the big guys transitioning to EV
gonna go nutty tomorrow
do I? I feel like they're usually mad at me too
[deleted]
small dick club
Hopped in on the SAVA pump with Puts at the end of day.  The gains might work out.
OCGNüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Blizzard down over 10% AH after an earnings beat/in-line and light guidance. Seems like the announcement of Diablo IV and OW2 being delayed hit them hard. I bought a ton because seems like an overreaction that will disappear tomorrow.
Zillow laying off 25p of workforce. Remind me not to work for a real estate firm ever. thank you
I‚Äôm hoping my calls can ride the coat tails:)
IV crush
What a mod bet. Nice try, buddy.
Right. What announcement?
[deleted]
They are all held by the same people.
obviously citadel bought off the mods while simultaneously going bankrupt
PLTR is still a big disappointment. I might finally exit my position tomorrow so it can skyrocket
I like the memes but you're right, shits just a mess without it
To all of the people that said I was stupid for spending 15k on 37$ AMC calls

You‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm retarded
Hi bro
I've been holding since December
You have to email their customer support to get a free restart and they did it the next day for me since I contacted when markets were closed
Who here said to buy ROKU puts tomorrow. I need answers!
#ZILLOW LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO
Bloomberg just mentioned Zillow and the dreaded term "fire sale" in the same sentence.

&gt;Zillow‚Äôs fire sale could continue: The company expects to buy roughly 9,000 homes in the fourth quarter and said it will take a writedown of as much as $265 million on home purchases that will close in the final three months of the year.
I just want to be rich
Would be nice if Zillow stock went back down below 50, where it belongs. 

Srsly, go look at the 5-year chart.   It looks like a mountain that's impossible to climb.
just buy PUTs for earning
Logical explanation would be sector rotation of value and those sales need to go somewhere else. Not sure I believe that is what is happening when it does though.
It‚Äôs the truth. You can also set a watch by the rebound that happens once he‚Äôs done.
Tsla is drilling me
How is nobody talking about the stock that everybody was mentioning below this?
I know but for the past week or so I could at least browse the dailies and not see a dozen tO tHe MoOn posts on 2005's hottest stocks
Puts on $CAR , went up 108% ! Better believe it‚Äôll fall hard, by at least 50%
[deleted]
Those are shit P&amp;d, not memes
OCGN üöÄüöÄüöÄ
EVs now are the dotcoms of 2000 if you can‚Äôt see that you‚Äôre a noob
cus big shots love grifting off these "apes" who never take their profits
100 percent cash gang
Sympathy play.
Soo BBBY market cap is only $1.6 billion and it plans to increase the amount of shares it buys back by 2021 to $1 billion( $400 million this year). It also announced a partner ship with kroger which means it has even more revenue. It also a meme stock so people will buy because of that and it has a 27% short float so shorts are gonna have to buy back at these prices at open. This shit might really run this week.
Those stimmy checks be hittin at the same time
G![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)E
UBER, DKNG, PTON
Private discord channels and FinTwit
MM making it go uppies to dump on all you bulls tomorrow
She gonna get wrecked very badly
I sold off when it hit $15 it's definitely getting pump and dumped
You don‚Äôt even need to speak to anyone about it now. Just go to your settings and you should have the option to reset it there
As someone holding calls, sucks to suck unfortunately! Been there. Scalp IV tomorrow
Flair for this tard
What announcement?
I thought it would be on a Friday
Someone explain this to me please but how come all these meme stocks always move together? Serious question
What‚Äôd I miss?
That stock is overvalued shit
Blowjob bet, winner picks whether they give or receive
I received notice from TD today.
TLRY going to get wild tomorrow finally. This JP Morgan announcement is gonna send this thing flying.
Damn most memes gave the pop back aka CLOV WISH FCEL to name a few
Great day for mall REITs. Lots of companies riding Simon Property Group's enormous coat tails today.
Let me guess Cathie is buying more Zillow
Well what fun is that?!
I like it so far!!!!!
&gt; The stonk was a type of fish that lived in the ocean. It had two eyes, one on each side of its body and an eye-patch over both eyes. The stonks were hunted to extinction by humans because they tasted like chicken when cooked with garlic sauce and served with rice pilaf
[trapped](https://youtu.be/j-VUV9VcRAQ)
Leftover st patty‚Äôs beer?
for the time being I actually prefer it more than the TSLA shills. That one's continuously retarded and keeps delivering. These apes have been waiting for quite some time for fruit üçåüîú
HO LEE FUK just checked AH on meme stocks. Guess my weeklies won't go to waste
I would but have no idea anything about draft Kings, they're strike price is low enough to interest me though
Ocugen is gonna pop tomorrow or maybe later this week..
CASH IS TRASHHHJ
I seriously gotta stop selling covered calls. WTF was I thinking? Stonks only go up brah
!banner PATH $70 post December earnings call
At this point they better know how to levitate
They set me up....2 days into no nut November too. I was going for most improved player this year.
/u/zjz only tolerates SDC posts
This is so annoying, but I am glad you made it to better days.  Things always get better, ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Mind, blown.
you know youre allowed to trade AH too right?
Get ready to be left behind.
Lol glad to see some diversificarion there w SQ
Hey can we all jump in the Ah pool and pick up extra Amc in extended... push ittttt
Word on the street Fed might have to start QE, aka reduction in monthly repurchase of $120B bonds, sooner than originally planned Inflation way outta control

I call bloodbath tomorrow ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
I don‚Äôt mean to brag but the first time I ever bought a GME call was on Friday üòé beat that timing
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

AMC got some serious legs. Prepare for a big run soon
I like the 10% of people who think meme = cult rather than the apes shrilling their shitty ticker

#mods we need the fucking popular ticker thread asap
average down or sell next time lol
God I hate pump and dumps. Why are there so many nowadays
Z is about to CHGG'out
Hood is all alone in the woods with the big bad wolf
Damn so Zillow calls were a bad idea for me.   I guess kind of like a website trying to flip houses
It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm a gay bear, it‚Äôs just that I have zero clue where this market is going. And I was buying in April of 2020
Found Burrys burner
not just GME retard. why is BB AMC GME all mooning at same time AH? i cant with yall i swear
CLOV has best value here, it has just as much meme potential and still only up \~1% after hours
I was gonna buy GME calls around 3:30pm to spite the mods and get my post reinstated. I feel like a fucking moron now.
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/SleazyAsshole** bet **BABA** goes from **163.29** to **175.0** before **2021-11-16 17:31:54.423502-04:00**
I never got a free reset. They hit me with the 90 days the next day lol
Everything‚Äôs priced in, hun
Nice!
Uber is up 7% AH dingus
Last time this happened was January FALL. Not run up. The run up happened THEN  the restrictions happened. Get your facts straight
!banbet BABA 175 2w
90% cash gang rn I can‚Äôt risk Powell not getting re-elected shit would be bloody
DOCN. You better get the FUCK UP
They Are talking about it dumbnuts. They (the company) are accelerating their stock buy back program.
I‚Äôm playing MAR earnings. It rhymes with CAR so it‚Äôs going parabolic tomorrow
the interface is kinda clunky but it works. hopefully that gives you some fapping materials for this evening lol
AMC Nov 5 41C @ 0.87
GME Nov 5 270C @ 1.41 

Tomorrow couldn‚Äôt come any sooner.
BBBY shorts are fucked
https://ibb.co/gg4wN2q

Fed or dems tryna sneak a casual 250,000+ SPY buy order in. I‚Äôm fucking dead üòÇ
Yeah feel for the founder. They tried to really innovate and change the whole home buying process, which sucks. Traditional real estate agents win here
how tf you buy the top twice. either get more or less susceptible to fomo so you buy in earlier or not at all retard
Boom roasted
gme goes down, must be manipulation, gem goes up, must be manipulation!

That's exactly what's happening
Selling my qcom 125/130c capitalizing on vega just before earnings
Months ago. No impact on the thesis
&gt; No, I don't think you can get a put option on JPow.
Holy shit Tupac bought GME
Restricted where
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
That's clearly expected as we're seeing billions of inflows. We'll see what happens.
I fuckin hope so

XOS float says 55mil but it's much smaller than that. Average daily volume is 1 million. When this catches fire in the next week or two its going to double in 2-3 days
&gt; No, idiots are the ones who buy it

Bought amc at 65 and GME at 350 and still holding them bags ü§° ü§° ü§°
That's what everyone is expecting.
If you‚Äôre not making money tomorrow then you‚Äôre in the right sub.
Then I am sure that just by being a positive, productive, happy person will be reward enough for all of their contributions to your success. Pass if forward as the opportunities to do so arise.
You could've been a hero Bill.
I feel sorry for the FSR cult. By the time they actually get a car into production the EV bubble will already have popped and all these stocks will be -80%.
Poor HOOD is all alone getting ass rammed in the corner ü§£
Jesus, that‚Äôs a lot of retard in a couple sentences.
How funny would it be if the nerds in Dallas expecting JFK Jr, Tupac, Dale Jr. etc to show up today were just getting trolled all along by Russia or some other Reddit nerds?

this Z earnings call is rough
Deploy a reinforced garrison of troops!
you bastard im in

Optionsprofitcalculator.com is a free calc, though won't factor in future IV changes. IV will spike heavily in the am but will decay quickly if things don't keep exploding
Naw. There was some great DD about the way AMZN operates‚Ä¶by purposefully putting its competitors out of business. Like Toys R US
Yessss BBBY brother

Where can you watch/listen the fed meeting?
Not remotely true and was confirmed directly with CS.

GME literally didn't do this much volume last earnings in AH...
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
Forgot the rush I got from playing ER lol
It's good for flat gang
The people who call in on Jim Cramer mad money are boomer af. Looked up their recommended tickers and they‚Äôre all trying to get their bags pumped on a bunch of stocks that have been stagnant or negative the past 5 years üòÇ

Let's hope AMC keeps momentum!
I hope so, because I'm going to try to catch the flight.

Not to be a üåàüêª but I think if you can afford it, some BBBY puts will make easy money tomorrow morning, especially if you set the expiration a while out
TD restricted short selling of GME, any naked call selling, 100% margin, and if you want to sell a covered call you have to call a broker to do so. Last time this happened was Jan run up
Most likely another vague 2022 estimate

Holy fuck no. Clov is garbage.
I have puts on SPY and calls on memes. Hoping it‚Äôs exactly like last meme push.
ATVI on sale after earnings
Will fed announce tapering tomorrow?
too high imo
Dude how did you figure that out? I've been trying to find a calculator for that. I can't focus on anything else but that right now lol. Probably won't sleep tonight.

Happy Novembrrrr everyone. If you‚Äôre not holding at least one of those stocks then WTF are you doing here.
You whippersnappers sure do get worked up over some small percentages. Back in my day (2020) AMD at +6% was considered a flat day. Anything under that was bearish.

BBBY BBBY im woth it üí∞
Why know about $DMOB? New Tesla?
Does $BBBY have their own sub?
Your words are inspiring to call holders
You‚Äôre seriously underestimating the overlap between markets, the leverage utilized and the speculative mania that has occurred in all things. 

As one draws down so will the other do to an ending credit cycle and monetary tightening. Retail traders not having houses specifically doesn‚Äôt matter, what matter is ramping down speculation with liquidity drying up. People aren‚Äôt buying at stupid prices and the people that lend the cash for this aren‚Äôt extending money anymore.

Bag holding is in season.
We know what to do. Moon mission back on
HODL VMW
 BB back?
It‚Äôs Tesla gains too.
EOM, more likely
XOS gonna update that the FedEx order of trucks has been delivered on schedule as promised. Amazon and UPS also most likely following suit. Earnings Nov 11 gonna be lit

Will it take occasional breathers? Yes. Then you buy the dip.
Sounds pretty safe to me.
Welp there goes my amc puts
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
Lol typed it in one word cause ur a lil bitchh![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Lmao
Don't bother buying options that are 1-2 days or more away, buy only ones that expire same day.  They move faster.
Nah I didn‚Äôt even think about it
I need a few of those green meme dicks to slap clov up to 10 to escape. Been in bagholder hell for tooooo long.
Looks like it‚Äôs meme week ahead. Tesla gains are fueling this.
How is nobody talking about how bed bath and beyond double their share today. Pushing 48m volume when its average is 6m.  fucked up
It is happening‚Ä¶ again.


It is happening‚Ä¶.. again
Everything was more fun in January. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it
#imagine if BB announced the patent sale tomorrow üöÄüçá
banbet ya nerd
My Activision call weeklies will resurrect right?
Meme stocks rising is the sign of shorts covering. Huge market wide dump incoming once shorts are done.
Sell and buy back in under $25. Just my 2 cents. It's pure speculation at this point.
Uber you son of a gun. Come here and let daddy hug you!
Are you retarded? Do you only have 3k to play with? Tf?
Sure. Bond tapering was never a big deal, since it‚Äôs not like they are going to stop, simply slow. Once they announce their schedule for it, the market is going to rally as they await a decision on rate hikes which won‚Äôt come anytime soon.
So youre just yoloing into a gym company that hasnt turned a profit in the past 4 years based on an alleged investor friend doing the same? Bound to print
Holy fuck I'm happy I held
MGGA FELLAS, TOMORROW WE FEAST
Mods!
For now. Don‚Äôt hold your breath though.
GME AMC BBBY BB and all other memes gonna +50% tomorrow and even the SPY will move higher too vs last time the SPY died. Bulls gonna be making money hand over fist
[deleted]
Can we start chanting AMC again?
Spy bags?
May be the last day to get in AMC before accepting it‚Äôll be anywhere from $45-100 the rest of this week
Hell ya, grats! That‚Äôs unreal
Do you have any plays on it?
shit about to be a pennystock
Who‚Äôs playing Uber after Lyft beat earnings? Uber reports Thursday after the üîî

Reserve my balls in your mouth. YOLOs only.
Guess who has covered calls on bbby with a cb of 47 per share ü§°
AMC and GME and BB ‚ù§Ô∏èüíúüçë
Wow that Atvi drop seems extreme.  My calls will be worthless forsure.
Buy GME 300 EOW
Cause of the Meme stonks?  I have both calls and puts in SPY. Liking my put position more
Futes looking like a golf course.

#RIP bears.

Physically incapable of selling*
Already have one going
Imagine tesla goes crazy tomorrow to lnaoooo
&gt; I have no idea.
SPCE lost its meme status apparently lol
holy shit congrats. Looking like a minimum $20k return. Probably higher
AMC PLZZZ
fuckoff
It‚Äôll get there.
I don‚Äôt even care about ATVI but wtf this dip is fake af. Makes me wanna get some calls in the morning. 

Revenue up, expectations beat, and it drops 10%? Not even the n word has this power.
Never selling
That‚Äôs why you always keep reserve
I need to sleep so it can be open already
Orginial Meme back at in business
Is the platform called wall street bets?
Bro i had 220 calls
yea man, im just going to temper my expectations here. I was originally going to exit around 20 so anything higher than that is gravy at this point. Def going to be hard to sleep tonight tho lol
Feels like Jan 2021 again .
Like the operator's phone number?
Did the same except i sold it 20 mins later for $2100 profit
Then make the bet
Rip
GameStop literally counted down the launch haha
We are both here yo!
#Keep going bby im almost there
You can almost set a watch to the drop when JPOW is getting ready to speak.
My AH profit looking sexy af
coz of BBBY, they're doing 1 bil of share buy backs all in the next year as opposed to originally scheduled 3 years

was only 1.3bil market cap at close today

idk why Melvin keeps doing this to themselves but shorting companies in the ground when they have enough capital to buy most of their float back is fucking idiotic
My ATVI 70p are now in the money. This should be a decent gain.
Hello fellow youngsters. What is the safest investment advice you could give me? That surely seems like a place for it. I am thinking for buying NKLA $70 weeklies
why the selloff, report doesnt look to bad does it?
Thank you, this is gonna help out big time.

FCEL selling down after hours looks to gap down in am low 9
Yes
That's my plan lol
There will be the dip late morning and after he speaks it'll moon
And here I thought AMC would continue to go down... Should have sold a weekly covered call instead one that expires after earnings.

Oh well, the strike is still way above my cost basis.
Needs to hit 50 first it feels like
Hope your correct. Just bought enough shares to cover my calls! Just kidding....did buy a lot of shares at 70ish.

fuck yeah bro, got my bbby calls @ 3:00 Pm today.

LFG
Thanks for the response man
GME strong and back boyssss
My own personal experience. It seems every time Meme Stonks start to rally SPY gets hit hard and falls.
I Just need it back up to $18 so I can break-even. Got around 80% of my life savings in this.

Blasphemy. Hope Elon pedos you!
Some brokers are disallowing short selling them so good luck
Im in at $12.50. im under no illusion that this stock is skyrocketing, if it makes $13 im gettin the fuck out
Next week. No exact date set yet.
Give me a YOLO Wednesday play for earnings, got rekt by Zillow
so glad i sold my GME calls earlier today :'(
AMC with this AH runup. Is it January again?
Was supposed to buy $3000 worth of AMC yesterday, but FUCKING FIDELITY can't settle money fast enough. ü§¨
Your dumb, short the S&amp;P buy meme calls, this is all because of the FOMC meeting tomorrow.
ATTTACK OF THE MEMES
The past 2 days are going to generate 6 months of content and 50k posts about conspiracies featuring $2000 accounts and a **lot** of charts and lines for the apes.
MEME STOCKS BABYY!
Dude that's 90k if it opens at 30, congrats!
laughable
Cant wait for the actual memes you guys provide. I‚Äôm hanging out in new. See you there

I bought yesterday before closeüòé.  $500 worth of 12/10 25c @ .13.  averaged up slightly today to .19
$CARS went up 220% today

$TSLA 70% in a week

what the fuck do u mean
Lyft pumping
The funny thing about tomorrow is that it's gonna be one of those rare days where 90+% of this sub prints money hand over fist

but the stubborn 10% that don't r gonna blow up their accounts just coz they wanted to be right more than they wanted to make money

all of market talk is for boomers.
I‚Äôm not willfully misunderstanding, you‚Äôre willfully being retarded. You‚Äôve just described, in way too many words, what collateral is. Except you seem to think Jeff Bezos goes to Citibank and says ‚Äúhey I need $10,000, here‚Äôs my loan application. For collateral I‚Äôll be using the entire company of Amazon‚Äù
If it opens at $30, that's a 24k profit plus IV, I'd say an easy 30k if you sell at open. Congrats!
Loaded up on 260 shares! Lets gooo
Possibly not as bad of an idea as expected...
Trying to rescue a bad bet. Huge buy of $ATVI sharrs $69.69 (or there abouts)
BBBY $80 by Friday close or permaban me
Sold my AMC options for 20% gain today. How many times can I miss on options with these meme stocks holy fuckkkkk
BB is due a run back to 15.
Let's go. AMC $100 by Friday close. It's going start again.
No idea what to do with my BB take my gains or hold for potential pamp pamp tomorrow AM
Taking slight profits on XPO and CZR seem to have been worth it so happy i dumped them

Either I make a fortune off memes tomorrow or I hit up my local wendys ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Its like Christmas came early . Movies and games for all
I used to but nah. If you go in on naked calls, you can turn it into a spread later though. It‚Äôs a good way to get around PDT. Can‚Äôt sell? Buy a put instead. Gains are locked in.
probably more than that if it holds
When does Rivian IPO?
That lulu ass sniffer on this sub was talking shit when I said i bought gme leaps
We all know what's about to happen here. Jan/Feb meme craze all over again.

AMC to $1000
Don‚Äôt be left holding the bag on the meme at 9:35am when whatever pump there is quickly sells off
Bbby 30??

SAVA can run to 300+ over the next few years, you'll be fine

It‚Äôs like an 18 year old redditors wet dream
1k was January shit. We are going for phone numbers
I was down 14k at 10am. By the close I am only down 8k. I am treating that as a 6k gain, and having a beer for everyone at the bar üçªüçª.
Ocgn news probably gonna be PM

THE APES HAVE ENTERED THE CHAT üöÄ
Yeah I don't have much to work with rn (just a couple k) so I had to play it safe. I think there'll def be a dip no matter what though. Its just whether its before or after the Fed thats hard to call
Well either we're all be fucked by the end of the week or we going to get some serious money I guess (ofc till we lose it all again bcs apes being apes)
lol all u homos holding TSLA for a decade should have just thrown $100 into CAR calls at open

Selling the $77 strike put I bought on ATVI yesterday

Hope yall got gme
I know what u/cashflow_ wants to hear from JPow tomorrow.
My Nov 270 SQ calls were bleeding today so I sold half of them. The rest can ride.
Talked myself out of Z puts and bought AMC calls this afternoon. Looks like my choice didn‚Äôt matter üí∞
Yep
At this point everyone knows theyll pass the vaccine, stock reflects it. I think itll dump either way (sell the news)
Okay which lucky bastard bought BBBY calls today?
What's happening üò± gme,amc,bbby
wsb: BBBY has earnings in a month prob
it's currently my best performing investment % wise at least... but i always feel like the end is near

RIP bbby shortsellers. This will be an interesting one to follow.

Here is a stock that‚Äôs never spoken of here, Vertex. Followed their insider trades and bought some shares just ahead of earnings. They beat their earnings and raised guidance. 

Anyone took a chance on Chegg today?

I second this point.

If the WHO says no to oCGN and covaxin I will not be having a very good Christmas üéÖ
my butthole getting sore. earnings weren't far from expectations but for the last week, almost every earnings has been sell the news, and by sell the news I mean, -15% for in line earnings.

I don't think analysts are actually listening to earnings, just fucking and sucking themselves off, buying and selling to each other at the 70$ mark
üåàüåàüåàüåàüåàüêª
Nicely done asshole
There‚Äôs only 102 million shares outstanding for BBBY, and they are buying back $400 million worth of shares in he next three months. This move up is pretty justified although I‚Äôm not touching it til it settles down a bit.
The one that looks like the barrel of a shotgun

I know right. Account only up 11%. The disappointment is so much, imma gonna need it to do it again tomorrow, maybe rest of the week just to make sure I‚Äôm really screwed‚Ä¶

Sold my pfizer calls for decent profit hour before close. Shit.
Who knows. I think PayPal is a huge buy rn.

Meanwhile DWAC is in red ah üòÇ
Only if you're trying to make huge gains. If you keep it to simple moneylines and not crazy parlays/prop bets it can be fun and slightly profitable
Alright, time to go to new and check out the dank ass memes this clown market will produce.

Ahh shiett, i just loaded up on calls and shares! Good thing its leaps 2024 and shares with 3 OTM covered calls sold,
UHAUL earnings play. Amazing cash flows and undervalued af
wtf even uber pumping in AH this is bullshit
How fuck are my 77.5c for atvi expiring 1/22
I mean, there's like 6 subreddits for it now
I have 116 TMUS weeklies but I don't think it will pan out. 

Earnings? Work out for me? Good one.
Bought GME weeklies this morning when it dipped, sold at close. Made good profit but fuck my butt somebody cooked up the beans after hours.
Is BBBY gonna continue to rip?? I know the shorts are fukt
ah, i missed that. thx
hedgies shaking in their reptile skinned boots
What‚Äôs a retart

They ain't got shit on BBBY rn, which is up 80%
Can somebody tug my cock
Wish I had known about it. Congrats
What rave do i go to this weekend w/ this new chick?
you mean we live in a meme world?

always have.
Oh boy meme stock szn is back

_sigh_

_unzips_
Sports betting is awful. You end up losing everything one day or another
Over valued piece of shit should drop by 50% just like chgg
BBBY puts first thing tomorrow.

Buying back your own stock to stop the bleeding is cheating fam
How the fuck does BBBY have the cash for a billion dollar buyback with their financials?
You know what? Seeing Z, CHGG, SNAP completey shit the bed during this covid bull market makes me feel better about my losses. I'm not the only retart!!
Great play, I‚Äôm in 700 shares myself. If I wasn‚Äôt in, I‚Äôd probably see if there‚Äôs a dip before/after earnings to get in lower but we may be talking pennies on the dollar here.

Only reason I say that is it may dip if it can‚Äôt hold above this current $21 resistance. But this WSB after all so go for it to avoid the ride
It‚Äôs that time of year babyü¶ç
You think it will crash 50% before open?
This $Z call is a disaster.. 

Looking similar to the chart.
If I knew how to send a screenshot I would, but you can see it on Webull
Bbby
AMC outpacing GME for now
Bbby sympathy
Meme up, growth down.  SPY is fuk
After it pumps, then they issue the stock back.
Yeah I'm not surprised. Banks know interest rates are going up in 2022 and I doubt they want to get caught with their panties down.
You missed BBBY unfortunately
R u serious ?!
Nah used to the morning dip. So retarded I‚Äôll probably grab more.
Looking good so far, best of luck to us both tomorrow!
Looks like bbby knews triggered citadel algos.

So many memes to short after hours . Went short CLOV WISH
stonks down AH. Memes mooning especially the kings GME and AMC. the market is healing
Not BB, no.
We are rocketing üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Atvi why.
Don't poke the bear friend. Know when to pick your fights
Just talked to zuck, he says he is making inflation in the metaverse really low maybe even 0. Jerome is in talks of moving the entire system into there.

Other people had quit the week prior so she thought they might get desperate.  She is also a bit of a dramatic personality.
Paper handed my CHGG puts at open for big gain, but woulda been bigger gains if I held.

Gme is still gme!
Wtf is going on with bbby?
I want to be like u one day man ü§ûüèº
I hope so, bought puts, and uvxy calls.  Bull run into fed is weird..
everyone literally always says that every single day ever
I know y‚Äôall hate it, but MEME SZN is starting up whether u like it or not. Get on the ride or don‚Äôt complain when all the other stonks crash with this chaos. We‚Äôre just a speck in this financial exchange. Ride the wave bros. NFA

I‚Äôm on AMC and GME
See this is why people fucking hate you guys
As annoying as meme stock cultists are it sure is fun watching the charts
What
[deleted]
yeah people watching this shit for the last year won't give 2 fucks bro
SQ and COIN are the EOW plays I got. They‚Äôre both climbing the ‚Äúmost popular‚Äù app charts. COIN number 1 ahead of tik tok. Cash app number 11 or something. Up from #30 early this fall. 

Good long term and short term plays.
what‚Äôs cookin
They beat earnings but didn‚Äôt beat ape
Zillow rebranding themselves to Meta.
You'll have to take out another mortgage on your house to do it
chgg better be buying their shares back with both hands this week.
It may not but it goes along the lines of be the change you want to see, and you are investing in companies of said nation. Like a person that says McDonalds is a terrible company that treats its workers horribly but then eats there three days a week.
Same thing as Every day
Hoping its green and not Red
activision wtff
Been there too. Your home is worth exactly the offer you will get when you sell. 

I have to say, the banks are now very meticulous about their estimates. Noise level, traffic, etc‚Ä¶that kinda stuff.
Goddamnit GME you jumped the gun, I was waiting until Friday to buy calls for the regularly-scheduled jump
Hardly. We just got our positions today bish
WSB is like the clone factory in Star Wars‚Ä¶ we will always make more retards, it is unstoppable.
I think I've heard this before.
112.4% of BBBY is owned by institutions.
It's like if you give a mouse a cookie, except retards with derivatives.
GME &amp; AMC to the fuckin moon!
Wow, what a BOMB by Zillow.  Maybe you apes have a chance to buy a home after all.  A big correction seems imminent.  Z willing to eat huge losses to unload now and completely scrap homebuying
earnings is the 11th though
&lt;eyebrow raises. Checks pypl close. Compares the two numbers. Double checks the date&gt;

Eyes widen at the sheer‚Ä¶bravery.
Amc sucks dick that‚Äôs what happened
Went down
At least they have enough underwater houses that everyone can work from a home
&gt; The markets are crashing.
Bbby broke the meme basket haha
Just keep pushing your pump and dumps and stay out of apes waym there is room for everyone.
Apes ripping, Bears R.I.P ing

Real memes melt steel beams my friend. Gme is a real meme

Yo wtf is happening to all the memestocks rn??
Thinking I‚Äôm gonna move into $SOFI tomorrow. They‚Äôve already had a streaky week and there‚Äôs a lot of chatter about this bank charter which could rocket the stock. Found this article on their financials [SOFI Long Article](https://www.makingamillennialmillionaire.com/post/could-sofi-fund-your-portfolio-s-growth)
Fuck that.  We need SALT repealed.

I feel like SPY will be mid-rugpull by open tbh, closing was pretty bearish imo with 3mil trades and a dropping price from 350-410. Hard to tell with the low volume after that though
Huge Macy‚Äôs guy
Just has to last until open to sell my calls and then I don't give a fuck
MGGA #GME
![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
Had half a mind not to do this today and just jump out with profits, glad I didn‚Äôt listen lmao
Yea i saw that. Whenever amc or gme announces good news the stock goes -10% lol
Ah the final blow off the top for meme stonks

Won‚Äôt miss this shit
Looks like the funs over now
Ehh I'll let you have it. You guys are gonna do that thing where you stick around and try to colonize this place. So fucking annoying.
It‚Äôs time . The third wave of retards are gonna come raining in BBBY is leading the ship this time
Wut mean BBBY billion dollar buyback advanced fiscal 2021?
GME
I foresee myself attempting to day trade TF out of memes tomorrow, knowing damn well it‚Äôs prob gonna end poorly

Put some tin foil on your head and you might find out
wow, shit is poppin. if this holds up im gonna make some bank off of the idiotic calls i bought last week.
The memes are coming back üôÉ
thinking about buying 100 shares BBBY in ah and selling a covered call tomorrow, no way it maintains this for long
I mean to say. congrats and fuck you
it is!  TO THE MOON!
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Damn BBBY
[deleted]
Gotta thank who made all the memes jumped right? All the algos are pumping meme rn because bbby announced that they are buying back shares/expanding on their e-commerce with Kroger
zillow 2.0 üòÇ
Coulda been worse, and you might've paper handed it to lose half your money.
don't ever look a gift horse in the mouth
TO THE MOON!
The last time meme stocks took off, the market shit the bed. If it shits the bed with Fed taper tomorrow, boy‚Ä¶oh boy

No u
XOS is gonna go up in a straight line this week. You just watch
üßªüßªüßª

At least I didn‚Äôt paper hand and sell for a huge loss, I‚Äôd be so miserable right now
Sold my BBBY $21 11/12 calls ... And now it's üöÄ
Please, god.
Just watch memes be red tomorrow. 

These AH means nothing 

BBBY actually had news and now people are anticipating a meme rally because it‚Äôs up or something
Dude. Fuck me I was so close.
Its fun tho
Amc ripping
Whales are realizing that regardless of how retarded the ape thesis is that the illiquidity they‚Äôre causing is turning a fairly small float into even smaller one. When they finally do announce some actual news this earnings, it‚Äôll finally pop. Obv it won‚Äôt really go past 500, the gamma is just way too expensive, but she‚Äôll run.
So glad I bought Zillow at $136, its definitely hitting the analysts' projections of $180.  Definitely.
Yeah thats the thing with illiquid assets in general. Estimates are often wrong and you get something thats not what you expected. Im a homeowner and people say that housing is going up but I know my house is going down for example.
People still spamming BB boggles my mind. Hasn‚Äôt been over $12 since fucken June. Did you guys get in at $20? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my long play!‚Äù While hundreds of better long plays have double and tripled in that same time and held it.

Worse than the AMC/GME apes.
BB UP IN AFTERHOURS!  TO THE MOON!!!!!
Why is my portfolio red but SPY is hitting ATH everyday the past week.
After this afternoon it is good to see some volatility. Let's see TSLA have a real move either direction.
i know but stocks can move based on its sector. why u downvoting
Just put in a order for Zillow stock at $20. Let's see how long it takes to fill ü§£
Shorts are in shambles
I lost my ass on the NFL picks this week.  (And Michigan on Saturday)
So GME and BB calls at open ?
stfu already
Anyone have BBBY as the catalyst for meme stocks to moon on their WSB bingo card?
I‚Äôm too jaded.. expect most memes to be barely up by market open, the rugpull on spy bulls before 2.  I may sell some CCs on GME though with the IV up
yeah, hard to pull the trigger when its already down 10%, I figured the bad news was getting priced in. Oh well
I applied to two jobs. One canceled the role and the other rejected me. GME is here for me tho. Finally in the green :‚Äô)
GME
AMZN acquires GME.  I don‚Äôt hate this thought.

Why the fuck are all the meme stocks mooning ?? Bbby??
You said AMC was fuk from beginning what happen
GME üëÄ
Bro. . .Like c'mon. . .these ATH every day are starting to scare me. . .
Totally normal stuff happening right now, nothing to see here- GG
BB taking off let's gooo
Mother of God, BBBY up 80%...
Bbby
What you can do right now is SELL SHORT the stock in AH.  You are COVERED by the CALLS you own.  Sell enough to cover your costs and ride the rest.  Good luck!
These are my hopes for tomorrow, actually
Weed was two weeks ago, then solar/tesla, surprise cameo from a rental car stock, and now we‚Äôre back to December/January memes. Weed probably won‚Äôt roll back around now for a couple months. Unless shroom boom actually happens this time and maybe drags weed stocks around for another pre-dump pump sesh.
Guess who was gonna get BBBY 17.5c yesterday but forgot cuz he got a liiiiiiittttlle too stoned?!
Look at Bbby. Hedgefunds trying to cover fast
CRSR not moving proves it's not a meme stock. These bags are forever ü•¥
All Meme stocks surging AH. Expect the one I own ofcourse. SDC Go up you piece of shit.
Its coming ape brother.  This is the way
Sometimes being retarded is better
They found the bunch of keywords Algo love, and used them in a press release, I suppose.
So SPY and VTI are both up about 40% on the 1 yr chart. Thinking might be time capitulate and just DCA into index funds‚Ä¶
It's just retarded enough to be plausible.
Knew it was gonna shit the bed before it did
ALL MEMES TAKING OFF
Yeah they killed cod fuck em
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Ah I‚Äôm just poking fun at ya man don‚Äôt get too upset. Not sure why me making my own money and telling you what credit score you have are issues here, but I digress. I know you don‚Äôt because your posts in anti work and unemployment. Hope it all works out for you. If you get a degree in software engineering let me know I can help get you a job.
Fuck you and gg!

Up 150k on GME. Papa wants another 2 milly.
See you in Vegas
Mad with power
Can BBBY move like CAR did today?
[deleted]
MEMES PUMPING LMAO BBBY
Good buy whichever meme you like. EVERYONE GETS TO EAT. From what we have just seen, bbby is leading the charge rn
remember when CLOV baggies wouldn't shut the fuck up and thought they held a meme stock
GME
I ain‚Äôt fucking with SPY. I play puts when I see large volumes to the downside on that sucker.
ROOT liftoff. Carvana partnership and guidance will be factored into these earnings for the first time. Expect major meme'ing
MGGA
So glad I didn‚Äôt sell those AMC calls today
grabbed that one. I've been watching it for months, this absolutely retarded AH action is perfect. beat estimates, made a commitment to changing, AND raised guidance.
That‚Äôs what I usually do, I thought I was learning to be smarter but nope, I‚Äôm just bad at this
This place is way better when memes are just a pumpin 

Hope we see some sweet memes
üìÑ üôå
ROOT getting a rub here too??
That says a lot about their Zestimate. They ate their dog food for once and it destroyed them. Home owners always believe that bullshit and think their homes is worth more.

JPOW is solely to blame for the fact that you can only make money on one side of the market anymore.
  
He's turned the market into a literal casino. Hardly anything to do with fundamentals. Everything to do with momentum and fake optics.
  
He's against a new army of "investors" who know nothing about valuation and trust their money to YouTube chart wizards.
  
It's all about price momentum. It's all a joke.
  
You're a joke, JPOW.

My puts were 1 week too early.
Welps. BBBY just paid off my student loans.
They should have liquidated everything by September
Meme stonks are mooning after-hours. We are finally back!
any interesting AH moves other than the meme stonks?
Scary that it might be possible
Damn BB after hours moving.
GME
Im starting to think that the ‚Äúconspiracy theorists‚Äù and ‚Äúcultists‚Äù might be right after all.

Yeah GME did the same thing as well

Below $70. $69 fits that company‚Äôs perverted lifestyle.
This is how it‚Äôs always been. The apes of WSB will not change; failure only makes stronger, purer, and more retarded. 

Just gotta enjoy the show they give us.
Let us know what you buy next
The news came and it went down even harder though
Just sold my 11/19 bb calls I got frome that dudes post of his jugg. Made 50% but am missing out big on this AH!!
I bought 3 390s yesterday as a joke. üëÄ
The euphoria is back everyone let‚Äôs fucking go!
It‚Äôs going in the upward motion.
You want fries with that?
Tomorrow is gonna be buck. I‚Äôm either losing everything or eating steak off a high end hooker‚Äôs b hole
&gt; I'm sorry you are mad.
I sense some serious gain porn tom if these meem numbers hold. Shit
Same!
LETS GO BB LETS GO, LETS GO BB LETS GO
Ive never posted gain porn before but tomorrow I just might. Hopefully she stays up and doesn't crash.
i should've held my GME 200C. FUCK MY LIFE WHY DOES IT MOON AFTER HOURS WHEN I SELL EOD
Some more news:

*Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. Advances $1 Billion Three-year Share Repurchase Program Within Fiscal 2021 
$BBBY

It‚Äôs also still heavily shorted with short % of float at 58%. So might be some covering too.

The stock behaves irrationally so who knows what happens between now and Friday.
Can‚Äôt wait to read about what fund got blown up tomorrow and how they‚Äôre getting a totally legal loan to help shore up their books
Yeah I started noticing this for some stuff (mango) around noonish
No one told me about BBBY today ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

Bought a 12/17 GME 270c for $1195 back in September, it was all the way down to like $500 last week but I kept hodling, today it finally bounced back and I sold it for $1250

GME is up 10% after hours 

Why do I do this to myself
I‚Äôd take a few days off retards, this place is going to be swarming with apes üöÄ

I have TSLA 1000P 11/5 because I love you
They had an IT guy that was more retarded than autistic that wrote an AI that bid WAAAAY too high over asking.
CAR and BBBY both going CRAZY today does not seem like a good sign, good earnings or not
&gt; they're going to grow by buying back stock and giving it away
What infrastructure bill, Senator Coalmine Munchkin from West Virginia keeps ruining it.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Damn I wish I was an insider. I‚Äôd have bought those BBBY $20 calls 5 mins before market close too. Nothing to see here SEC. Move along.
You ain‚Äôt got the credit for that üòÇ
This meme run is gonna be one of the great runs imo. Pick your poison. I like Gamestore the most so I‚Äôm all in Gamestore. It has been a year after the first great meme run.

Bruh... you serious with that after it single handedly dragged QQQ/SPY to new ATHs every day the last 2 weeks?
Yep, they gotta make their money back somehow
omg the open market will never respect that price, that's the one good part about AH trading.
Amc just open at 45 for me tomorrow ü§ë
Throw in some Nads for men while you're at it

WTF, is ATVI having a going to of business sale on their stock? The guidance wasn't this weak haha. Fire sale on leaps tomorrow.
Crazy. What made you think to go in on it? I remember last earning was bad, but I never thought about BBBY again lol
Gains? Congratulations you made a good trade. Do it again. The size of the win wasn‚Äôt the point. Growing your account is. Any day 4pm est rolls around and your account is bigger than at 930am is a Good Day.

# BASKET SWAPS ... üëÄüëÄüëÄ
Probably watching BB fall back down. But as for tonight ill crack a cold one for me going into the green finally
I have a fuck ton of December BBBY 20 calls. I was playing the gap fill.....omg this is amazing I don't know how to feel
I think I'm going to start paying more attention to earnings dates. It doesn't seem to matter what on the 10-Q it's just a good day to buy or sell. Also new spac/ipos are the same way, randomly good or bad, but always interesting.
prolly puts up the highest weight too
you sound kinda ungrateful....
Okay, memes are correlated somehow with algo trading, look at AH movement. There‚Äôs something deeper to this
The entire meme basket is soaring AH. Any ideas why? Could it be the BBBY earnings that triggered all this?
I was at $225 :)

So...when people rush back into meme stocks &amp; powell talking about tapering mid week, does that mean SPY tank? Plz say SPY tank

When people here are buying TSLA calls for 10 days in a row you know what to do

My sports betting account went from $200 to $3111 and then back down to $600 before I cashed out. I feel like supreme asshole
Not everybody bought at ATHs, also a lot of retail investors don't have houses in the places zillow buys in (either elsewhere in the states, not even there, or living with their parents or renting)

The current price of my house only matters when I want to sell (and what I buy is evenly overpriced) or in the worst case scenario I am in (have to buy out the wife)
at $50-$60 i might actually go long on ATVI again
Grabbed a couple $40 calls yesterday, figured it would have a bit of a run before earnings!

GME coming in with the green thunder cock!
All in on meme stocks for tomorrow following BBBY

BBBY going for bagholder round 2
All my put plays for tomorrow have had their underlying drop at least 8% AH.

Memes absolutely blowing up before FOMC so when the market crashes they can blame retail.
well, it's around 81, so you still have premarket for it to tank more
Idk why GME is moving. Idk why I bought a bunch of $300c yesterday either. Maybe I can buy my fianc√©e something nice tomorrow though.
I don‚Äôt have generational wealth. I grew up in a trailer house. Went to school, got a job, and started investing.
Memes are popping after hours!
Buying the 260 calls on CAR on Friday would have netted you a 2000 bagger if you sold near the top today.

Reminder that everyday you have the opportunity to retire just by pushing the right sequence of buttons on your phone
You carry gun ?
always sue bae
Dumbass $Z bulls got excited for a bit there. Just wait for the analyst call at 5pm..
They have disrupted the everliving fuck out of the real estate market, but I am having a hard time seeing how they are going to profit in any major additional way from the efficiencies they bring.  Bringing efficiency is a two-edged sword especially when you control neither the supply nor the demand side; in the end you may just end up compressing some other entity's margin, to no one's benefit.

I understand why they tried to corner the supply side, but I also understand why it was too big for them.  Real estate is a people business, not a tech business, and people businesses are hard to scale.
How do I find my banbet win?  I called GME @ 220

Earnings don‚Äôt make up sentiment. When your company has a bunch of bad press surrounding harassment and that‚Äôs what you have to address during the earnings call rather than focusing on the actual business it‚Äôs not a good look. They‚Äôre trying to cover their ass now, but it‚Äôs too little, too late. CEO should get the boot sooner rather than later
I have lot of AMD call expiring 2023

I know 5 of you in here hate it, but GME is still wilin‚Äô out AH
She could have just asked for a promotion like a regular person

Sold ccs and bought puts. Down a little mostly due to iv crush and wide bid-ask spread. Buy these babies will print. No way this stock is over $200 come 11/19.
My bbby puts are fucked. My atvi calls are fucked. My lyft puts are fucked. How unlucky can i get

A bunch of indicators are lining up for a jump, and we‚Äôre getting weirdly positive ah volatility. Most people are commenting because of the latter.
but do they do it in private?
Check out what happened to SNAP on their earning call
[deleted]
&gt; Why does the fed and congress think it's a good idea to create an environment where saving money is retarded.

Because the last 5 times they tried to back off QE before inflation hit, they created massive recessions.  At this point their model informs them that they have 15 years of missing inflation to catch up on before they restore to their 2% inflation + 5.5% structrual unemployment mandate.   

2% inflation compounded yearly for 15 years - the missing amount - is a net aggregate of 34.5% inflation.  If you then count the 2% we're supposed to be having going forward, we're in for a good 6.5 more years at 7%.

All I have to say is, if this is the plan, they better kick Congress in the ass to make it start, continue and finish with wages, because if they don't there will be no one to buy anything and the whole shitshow will look like America 1981-84 or Japan 1990-2010:  stagflation.
I bet if you Google "economics of silicon wafers" or "cost of silicon wafer" or something like that you'll get a better picture of the deep math of the silicon profit model
Honestly wouldn't be surprised given the frat culture they developed there.

&gt;Oh, good sandwich. 

Do tell.
So I just started a new job last week and one of my employees put in notice that same morning.  I think she might have been trying to leverage for more money but she was already the top paid person in  her position and had a reputation for not being a great personality with the owners.

She tried to rescind her resignation this week but the owner said he doesn't play those games so I don't even have a choice in the matter.  I'm about 90% sure at this point she never had another job offer and was YOLOing

Do you think she goes here?
TX beat earnings by 13.5%.  So naturally stock drops 10% AH.  If you have any cash load up on TX.  Gonna rip tomorrow. $50 EOD.

One of my favorite stocks just a little shy of the $1B minimum to discuss here. 

What else is there. Oh, good sandwich.
How come I see so many ppl saying this? I own a ton of AMC and GME so that would be great
Eoy rally
Holy sht. BBBY up 65% AH. Shouldn't have take this off my watch list. It was down to 16 per share.
Idk :‚Äô(
They said "yeah we're never gonna make as much money as 2020 where everyone sat at home playing WoW for 15 hours a day."

Called it üòÇ
Been crazy swings last two weeks. Just ride up and sell. I traded 1180c all last week buy for 6 sell for 20. Resisted the greed and sold. Good week.
Man I might have to play BBBY tomorrow
Gather shares of $Clov before earnings on Monday
That certainly works, and would beat 90+% of everyone here.
fk u
Tf these meme stocks going brazy plz Gme next
The cycle of meme is back. This time the apes will be stronger than ever. They are all holding in their nut. Raging shrek cock. RAGE ON!!!
MEME DREAM BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
Aren‚Äôt you still down massively over the last month from making terrible plays on SPY? How has it been working great
**Zillow:** ZZzzzzz...
Meme stocks absolutely mooning tomorrow, you heard it here.
the only people who get mad at others for selling are cultists and bagholders, sell when you want and/or need to
‚ÄúIf people are still paying 20MM for ape head pictures designed by a 9 year old your $TSLA short is not going to work.‚Äù üòÇüòÇüíÄ
I'm not sure, I expected more movement eod.
lol look at those swings. ppl in AH are retarded.
Imagine keeping BBBY shorts open after you made 40% on earnings drop. Those poor fckrz gonna have a rough day tomorrow.
Zillow CEO is smooth talker
Dude, no, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre willfully misunderstanding. Let me lay out an example



Daddy Bezos has billions in stock, but doesn‚Äôt want to sell because that would make the stock price go down a bit (literally the holocaust) and he also doesn‚Äôt want to pay taxes on it. So daddy Bezos goes to a bank and says hey ive got this fat billion sitting here but I‚Äôm not planning to sell my stock right now - why don‚Äôt you lend me half a billy and use my stock as collateral?‚Äù



Bank says ‚ÄúFuck yeah daddy Bezos, here you go‚Äù



Daddy Bezos now gets to spend half a billy but never had to sell his stock and doesn‚Äôt pay any tax on it. 



This goal behind this concept is not to make every jackass with $100 in their stock portfolio to pay taxes on unrealized gains. It‚Äôs to make every jackass with $100,000,000 in their stock portfolio pay taxes on a small portion of their ‚Äúunrealized‚Äù gains.
BBBY resurrection out of nowhereüçª
Ah. I almost bought some of that today. Made a 2nd account for my kid to pick stocks and that was on her list of possible ones. Darn.
No fair counting TSLA 3 times buddy
Is it weird I got a boner?
Taking small profits is an easy way to make money. Grow your war chest and those relatively small profits will grow too
My TSLA call gonna expire worthless I can feel it
Goodbye Zillow üò¢
Did you not hear about them telling you about the gigantic red flag 2 weeks ago?
Meems are such a powderkeg. BBBY moons and they all followed for a short while.
I don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôm ready to fly with the BIRD, ya feel me?

I mean my parents are pretty loaded and wouldn‚Äôt take money from me and I have about 15k stacked from bday money etc I watched the gambler last night and a bunch of Martin shkreli videos I‚Äôm abt to get jacked to the tits I‚Äôve been investing since I was 12 chances of me making 13% profit is unlikely but I want to yolo so I can give Martin some cash once he breaks out

as well you shouldn't be, nice play
I thought my puts on atvi were fucked. What happened?
BBBY 400% day tomorrow üí∞
Yeah I always inverse my logic on SPY and it seems to be working great
Amc, gme, bb, that other one I can‚Äôt name here. All up 5% ah. 

The OG‚Äôs that got restricted same as bbby. Bbby up 61% ah. Might be the catalyst for them to cover finally lol
&gt;Set a goal.  If you reach it sell.  If it moons after oh well.  You gotta be disciplined.
Bed bath and beyond up 67% 

Ho Lee Fuk
Yes but lukewarm so far.  I was hoping for better
BBBY opening at 60 tomorrow
Don't. You'll be a lot better off just not having debt and putting your money into the market as your earn it. Taking out a student loan and losing it all would negate anything they're doing for you.
So so confused someone explain what happened to APPS
After hours are fake and gay everyone knows this
I sold spreads dog they're not covered. that's what 200/210c means, it's a call spread
BBBY blowing past $50 tomorrow. You heard it here first folks.
Buy back
Activision implementing Sharia Law is a bold direction
Too much homework. Buy spy or a spy etf. Repeat monthly til near death as you reach for the sell button but your next of kin slaps your feeble hand away,‚ÄùI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù
Tesla puts would have been the play
Goodnight Zillow, Hello $OPEN üöÄ
Looks like F puts are back on the menu
Both are shares - too dumb to have played CLF options this far. 

Scarry, bit appreciate the feedback!
thats how I felt about these long term TSLA holders after doing 300% in a day lol

don't have to stomach the lows if you manage to get in on the way to a high

that being said i usually turn around and dump it into bad plays anyways
My thinking is, if they could have designed their way out of this shortage we'd be hearing all about it. But all we hear about is speed.
They‚Äôre hiring non-binary people
Pump my bb
GO BBBY GO
ATVI NOOOOOOO

NotLikeThis
I did with my Chegg calls yesterday lmao
What happened? I thought they beat earnings by a good amount.
$BBBY share buyback.  Swap basket stocks spiking.
They typically move in unison, which is why many think that they're traded as part of basket ETFs to obscure the short interest.
Some whale had his finger on the sell button?
ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë
I love America! And I buy calls all the time. Pullbacks for SPY are healthy and normal though and they do happen. Plus tomorrow‚Äôs FOMC meeting is expected to have bearish news. It may be less severe than people expected and SPY will keep flying, or it may not. We‚Äôll see tomorrow.
Pray no more tweety today
Stop at 24.70
If the apes were right and the market crashes from naked shorting on memes in a leveraged market im gonna lose my god damn mind lmao
AMC jumping like fuck right now
I don‚Äôt know what this means
He sold them before market close
Imagine jumping the gun on ATVI AH and buying &gt;80

Stock buyback

Edit: mixed with heavily shorted and meme residue leftover from January and you got‚Ä¶ catalyst &gt; boom

Die you piece of shit $Z!
I tried to sell 11/19 naked puts at the opening strike price of $170 and TDA told me it was to volatile and wouldn't let me. I could of made 12k without blinking.
Yo all my puts going to print??
AMC just went to 42 AH.  Crazy.
What the fuck is happening with this market? There‚Äôs so much stuff mooning.
*INTC
That actually sounds like a sound play
31-32
And there goes ATVI lmao
Is this February all over again? Same timing and everything
I disagree friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
Lmao wtf did they say on the ATVI call? Never seen a stock shit the bed so fast
i dont feel like reading the earnings reports, what toxicity was in it  that chegg dropped 50%?
You are, and the rest of the breathless and repetitive mentions on this sub
Had to change my shorts after reading the SALT cap deduction news. (Because I cummed).
It‚Äôs truly amazing I have any money left in my account at all
Almost sold my $10c 11/05 but glad I held on.
LMAO rip
Losing my ass on $ma calls
That's not very Bill Hwang of you. I heard he was allergic to puts
Do not do this....wait until you have a stable job, savings and a large diversified investment portfolio and then offer some financial reward to your parents.
üòÇ get fukd ATVI, this is what happens when a bunch of sexist neck beards run a company
Yikes. This interview is also brutal already.
Better than getting a lesson in adverse erection.
Considering loading up on BBY tomorrow in advance of all the nerds meming into the wrong stock.
BBBY best 20 dollar scratcher I have ever bought
Meme stocks are back in full force
What about it?
&gt; At this point even if GME mooned, the ones who have kept their money tied up for 11+ months probably still couldve done way better in the meantime and gotten back in with plenty of time

That's what they don't get. I've been in and out of GME a dozen times, made tens of thousands of dollars this year.

The only way I could have done better was to perfectly time all the peaks and valleys, which no one can do.
Cry
nice now there's the dip on a beat I was looking for. grabbed it! thanks for the reminder.
No ones, but memes are ripping
Wonder what allbirds is gonna do tomorrow
I have been scaling out
Not upset that I dumped 10k into it 10 days ago though
Greed is a motherfucker. I‚Äôm getting frustrated I only saw about $200 in gains today (daily gain was at $2000 at a point today after selling yesterday and buying back in lower today morning).

Someone put me in my place, please.
Keeping this as a reminder so I don‚Äôt feel bad for selling
TBH a bag of meth is probably cheaper than a TSLA call at this point, if you really need to 'be happy and get shit done'
Ah shit! I should have dumped my 100 Zillow shares last week for a $500 profit. Holding through earnings wasn‚Äôt the best move üòûüòûüòû -$1400 now‚Ä¶
Meme stocks coming back to life?
We don‚Äôt respect women
Wtf Zillow lmao
Yoooo wtf bb 33 call? 11/5 ?

Yes I am replaceable.

I still have no idea what you‚Äôre trying to say. It seems like you‚Äôre basically saying people shouldn‚Äôt get loans if they have collateral. That‚Äôs the entire foundation of the global mortgage and personal loan market so‚Ä¶ yeah that would be a very big problem if everyone decided that collateral isn‚Äôt a thing
Literally no one know
Riptivision. Can't afford the new cod now

You're OK with CLF if you're buying shares.  

CLNE I'd be a little more cautious about.  They're a company that might not exist this time next year.   Scale in, stick to strict percentages, and be ready to bail the fuck out with a small loss instead of diamond handing it to zero
Is LensCrafters publicly traded?
Last time we had this much volatility after hours it exploded
Why is BB üöÄüöÄüöÄing??
I‚Äôm down 10k on my TSLA calls today, still up +20k on them tho. I didn‚Äôt roll any, but I added a few 1200C weeklies today at low of the day.

Memes running, ATHs everywhere.. when rug pull?
That would tank the market. No one knows what he will do and uncertainty = bear market
Lol - you right
I honestly don't know- AM trading is nuts right now, random tickers going parabolic right after close.  What gives?
Shit I didn't see, so you own a 1,000 shares of NET? When did you buy in?
yea i'm still trying to find the news for the after hours move. I just figured the stock would have to bounce at some point, but i'm def going to sell most at open tomorrow morning
Yeah. To pay for a degree.

In addition to being really dumb, that‚Äôs also fraud. Just go to a bank and ask for $10k at 13% if you want to saddle yourself with debt gambling on the market
LMAO

ATVI
$bb please rocket to $99.69 thank-you
It'd be way too hard to manage
At this point even if GME mooned, the ones who have kept their money tied up for 11+ months probably still couldve done way better in the meantime and gotten back in with plenty of time

I dont touch that fucking stock though unless its a swing trade with like 5% of my account

It'll open at $78 and drill to $70, down 15% easily. 

#1 Their bid for profitability via house flipping is a belly-up loss that they're stopping.
#2 They were terminally unprofitable prior to the house flipping scheme.

Ah shit
Because money that is saved isn‚Äôt an economic incentive for anyone else to earn, nor is it fuel for research and development. Making money lose value over time makes you spend it or put it somewhere where it will be spent in order to create something which drives demand, rather than simply hoarding it. I believe that‚Äôs the conceit, anyway.
Nice initial move $ATVI. Thanks again Visual!

Lithium Americas - love this play ahead of final news of the acquisition of Millennial Lithium (Monday Nov 15th). This would put them on track to be one of the largest lithium producers in the world within the next couple of years. Should also get some further insight on their project at Thacker Pass with their Q3 earnings (Tuesday Nov 16th). Could be two nice catalysts to continue this post cup and handle run up. Not to mention raw lithium prices continue to move up exponentially. Anyways, I like this stock. Not financial advice.
I don‚Äôt want to talk about it
I'm literally just waiting for that interview to turn off CNBC for the day.

Damn it looks like i mightve actually called the bottom of Zillow. Too bad i was too much of a bitch to buy something

Surprised didn‚Äôt here more about it in here
Senator Coalmine needs to quit messing up the infrastructure spending bill and stay out of everyone's way. What he did to CHPT's price today is criminal and he should be thrown in jail.
I wouldn't put it into the stock market. There's just no way I'm going to make up for a 50k loss anytime soon with 10k on shares alone so it's of no use. But if you'd put a gun to my head I'd wait for a crash and put it into SPY shares.
Yeah but when the Fed is artificially keeping mortgage rates low until 2023 it is riskless.

Stop it BBBY, you‚Äôre going to make me $CUM
BBBY is buying back $1 billion in shares and the market cap is only $1.7 billion? WTF?
Retail yes.

But it's institutions that are important with tapering. If they rug pull you're done, retail owns like 10% of the market scattered around, and some of that retail are small llc groups.so real retail is likely 5-7%
Any predictions for Apple tomo?

We all know AH en PM are fake and geh.

I'm not really researching this, but if company A is not buying more houses because they can't sell them, I'm not investing in company B that is still buying.

Even if the market is good and A is just not having more budget to buy, this doesn't say anything about company B.

Either the market is great and both are thriving and all priced in, or something is up and B is in denial.
I wasn't sure how bad I was fuckin up buying BBBY shares the last few weeks, but the remaining ones are all profit now.
I'm sure a year ago, everyone thought Zillow was genius.
Yeah cus selling 6 digits worth of houses at a loss has nothing to do woth it, obviously
If I make 30% on an option I'm going to sell it. I'm going to sell at 25% most of the time too. Average increase in gains for retirement accounts is 2-6% annually. Buying TSLA calls now is a tough call it's up a lot recently. Pick companies that announce good news and just start their runs, and sell after it runs a few days. I got in TSLA calls at 970 when they announced increased price targets and sold yesterday as it got close to one of the new upgraded prices.

The prices will keep going up if they hold.  Home prices always do.
Nobody knows where the risk is, because it looks riskless until interest rates and monetary tightening exposes it as risky.

Zillow admits to literally being incompetent, if this is anything but a dump i just won‚Äôt know what to say
Wow.

Zillow announced a core strategy of its business, buying and selling houses, will stop, which is most of its previous $90 share price makeup. It also had bad earnings.

Down only 90 cents after hours as of this writing.

I smell fish.

And that's for $Z,  $ZG is up $.17 cents.
Lmao at BBBY
I sold calls. Didn't buy puts.  

Buying put spreads itm is some smooth brain shit.
Lol I'd love if that was the cited reason, undermining the rest of their business model. It seems that they just bit more than they could chew, having to manage all that physical property as a tech company. They're going to sell 7k homes to other institutional investors, who wouldn't be buying in the first place if they didn't see profit potential.
Oh BBBY..

Where's the risk. Take a look a Zillow, that's what happens when the Fed tightens. Things that seem riskless are risky.

Fun scam tho, ride it
Here‚Äôs a hack I discovered. I ordered delivery on uber eats and it was showing the driver was 30 mins away from the restaurant and driving in the wrong direction when the food was already ready to be picked up. The restaurant was only a 10 mins walk from me so I was kinda pissed and decided to just walk there myself. I was lazy and hungover which is why I did delivery in the first place. Anyway, I picked up my food and came home. Eventually the driver got there too but since they didn‚Äôt have the food uber refunded me and I got the meal for free.
Who ever down voting BBBY comment ,you a hoe.
If you wanna flip you have to be able to execute on a timetable.  Taper starts tomorrow and they needed to have had buyers by now for all those homes, which by now are probably stripped of copper and all their fixtures.

Trading is very easy until it‚Äôs very hard. It‚Äôs easy to have a plan and then pay too much attention to other parts of the market and start going off half cocked. Of course, everything is easy to know with hindsight. People were saying tesla was crazy overvalued when it was at 700 back in august, this latest run is completely insane.
things like that happen once in a while, I price it in... congrats on the sex
I'm short 10x 200/210c 11/19
Zillow with that surprise
If news yes
We beat earnings. Have lots of cash on hand. Gonna Issue a special decent dividend.

Market: fucking dump it
They still made billions without the home sales thing‚Ä¶

good advice, thanks man. i fomo'd in today which wasn't a great time but if i see a chance to average down I will
bought shares on that sweet sweet zillow dip. 77.62 cost average
Look at the rebound in Zillow, the hard 180 on flipping houses through Zillow Offers was actually a good management decision, not a bad one. They will continue growing without this added risk
Aaaaaand there‚Äôs the bounce
BBBY wants to fill the gap to 21
It's the number for how retarded the person posting it is
On new reddit they're like unicode for little images.
Got nothing done, but I actually had shit to do in my real job. Fuk. Coulda lost money.

$APPS drilled hard but coming back up‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt they crush those q3 earnings though?
they're new reddit emoji or something that only show up on mobile
LMAO is theta gang gonna steal this from the Zillow bears?
As a homeowner who bought in 2008 crash and knows how hard it was even then to get a house, fuck you Zillow for making it that much harder for regular people to be able to afford houses
Damn do it hold my AMC calls til earnings or sell smh
The next moderna
MTCH puts have been free money for like two weeks now and I haven‚Äôt bought a single one
its not even up to where it left off at close lol

Tsla 1200c 11/5 still possible?
Correlation does not equal causation
earnings call before open tomorrow
He looks like he should be a cast in the Full House reboot
Wait until SPY starts dropping cus of the fed, then try to figure out what price to buy calls at
COIN is gonna absolutely destroy earning/outlook &amp; rip
Zillow so bullish rn. Lmao.
OCGN LFG
Hoping the tards pump this CAR shit back up to $500 so I can short it again.
Average was 100M a few weeks ago. Crazy.
did not follow at all, but seems like the right thing to do, so my upvote
Time for the Daq to give up that ass!  -2% drop tomorrow!
thx dude..idk why i didn't think to do that
It is possible he sold calls....
Mention that ticker one more time?
What do you mean margin available? I don't trade on margin
Zillow shitting the bed = bullish AF on SPY
Last FOMC day, SPY opened at 436, ran to 440, dropped to 433 then closed at 437.
Lmao Zillow, when you get wsb entirely bearish you reallyyyyyy fucked up
Cleverly shitpost, pray for miracles, wait for stocks to go to moon, might eat a bagel.

Oh shoot. Looked at my $3500 in OCGN and it‚Äôs already $7k. Gonna sell for $70k tomorrow
Lmao way to volatile for me but was honestly curious if someone here did
Would be hilarious if Zillow dumping homes triggers a burst in the housing bubble.

Since housing represents 15-18% of GDP a bust could fuck up the broader economy.  Spicy thoughts.
Shit. I have puts on Uber.
Shyeeah
OCGN after hour heating up for tomorrow, fun ride indeed :)
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
Zillow has said they will stop buying and selling houses.

So it's just a listing site now, $5 eow. Maybe $10 if lucky.
Shorts building a position AH. Ain't nobody buying $Z here..
Zillow permanently ending it's business of buying and selling homes. So no more pushing home prices up?
Friday AM
This T-Mobile ceo is really trippy
Excited to see CAR gap down tomorrow
Look at every days last 10 minutes, it‚Äôs the most movement

This T Mobile CEO looks and sounds too much like a nice guy.

Doesn't he know that all the great CEOs are either psychotic, sociopathic, ruthless, autistic or dull?
Lyft smashed earnings, looks like UBER is the play
Yep, that's how it should be
I‚Äôve been trying to lookup to see when QQQ has earnings but my Robinhood app isn‚Äôt showing it

[deleted]
Yessss $ATVI
Earnings puts season
depends on how you define that.... it WAS down -10% after house, now its only down -8%
CAR has to drop no way it can continue
Especially with such low inventory stuff gets bought basically before it's listed.
Price predictions for $Z tomorrow?
always go to the actual company's investor relations page.

it's 11/9 AH Tuesday
Tsla calls probably

This T mobile CEO is a jag off....
goodnight Zillow. You deserve it for overpaying by 50k+ and driving housing FOMO.
It's always when I don't go heavy.

Wanted to load up on $Z puts before the close but IBKR didn't fill my order and TOS only filled 10 puts. GUH!!!
wtf happened to dell to make it tank?
Oh, interesting. What country? I'm always interested in how other countries tax securities.
Anybody getting on $DN tomorrow?
Thank you for letting me take your money!
What did she say today about this bullshit?


I buy 30 $34 11/12 puts at 9:10 at 1.10 each and by the end of the day it‚Äôs at .90. 20% loss in 2 hours

Just one thought, though. Since everything is short, does that mean people simply can't spend as much on gifts because they can't find anything, or on the contrary, people are going to spend more on gifts buying worst stuff for more money?
LAST ONE TAKES A GULP!! yummy
so when the fuck is COIN earnings? I see 11/2 on etrade, 11/9 on tipranks, and 11/5 on here...

As a member of the üåàüêª collective not all of us are salty downvoters. Despite my puts, ive been upvoting your celebrations god speed regards.
When there are no bots and algos people are so fucking slow. $Z Zillow announced they are shutting down buying home business all together. That means $OPEN biggest competition is leaving. $OPEN shares were down .33% after hours. Why? No idea. I bought 1,000 shares. Now it's up 8% AH
IM THE GREATEST SHITPOSTER OF ALL TIME

AND THREE TIME BANBET WINNER

oh, and bought CAR puts and got IV crushed
Zillow puts isn't printing unless you bought puts when it was trading at $104 , it's only down $4 AH
Shorting the fuck out of CAR
And with Zillow imploding I‚Äôm calling a market top.

Open season on meme stonks.
It was over $100 like 2 days ago
NCLH puts for earnings tomorrow. Hopefully can scrape a few tendies.
#Let the dump BEGIN
You took from family when there was margin available?  That's just terrible.  Anyway, I know how you can make $15 back.  Meet me behind Wendy's at 6:40pm.
Did you buy 11/3 or 11/5? Big mistake if the former. Drilling is gonna happen on Thursday or Friday if it happens. I doubt JPOW speaks before markets close tomorrow
As in, just shares and not options? Then keep adding regularly among a diverse group of stocks and wait. I just told you what any financial advisor would do, commission free.
paperhanding both losses and gains, but more losses than gains
Never been happier to be half in cash.
I was too poor to ever need you Zillow. But thank you for making me just a little bit richer.
Hopefully gonna bank on these ATVI calls
Some of you act like you‚Äôre Bill Hwang after blowing up a $2,000 Robinhood account.

Zillow belongs here jesus. Motherfuckers paperhanded all the houses they bought prepandemic
My $SPY Calls and Puts punching it out till 4:00 PM. Good sign the Calls are ahead, so $SPY up and away tomorrow...
God damn, let‚Äôs go Camping World. Tent guy might‚Äôve been right lmao.
So 2/3 on puts might make small gains. But hey, gains are gains.
We love losing money
I‚Äôm going to hope JPow doesn‚Äôt talk about tapering and rate hikes sooner so I don‚Äôt lose my ass and wife with my spy calls.
Absolutely. Really funny thing is I started out with all in Tesla portfolio that I was planning on holding for decades and would've doubled it by now. That's what's really fucked up.
If you see it dip, you need to start buying calls. Yesterday was prime buy time for NVDA. A lot of money went to AMD and today NVDA was targeted, gotta find opportune moments like yesterday to buy in.

Youll make 200-700%.
why do u suck

UPST below 430

Hopefully it's the sign for a fat dump tomorrow. Everyone is so conditioned to buy the dip and go balls to the walls on calls. We'll see tomorrow
So far: 2/3 on puts!
Of course I'm paying her back
I trade while half asleep because I am in New Zealand. I think I made a grand today but I'm not sure, gotta go over all my orders and see what happened through the night...

Saw some dude comment ‚ÄúI bought the Z bottom‚Äù and I knew it was his famous last words
Tesla will never go back to 1k per share again understand that. It'll never happen its over with. With that being said I hope you either averaged down or got some shares in on this dip.
I have a feeling that January will be the bear month. 
Up until then, there will be a few bad days mixed with some weeks, but January could be the pullback month. People having to pay their credit card bills for the holiday expenses and will allocate finances elsewhere rather than stocks. I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the bear comes out before Christmas. People will be buying gifts and will need extra finances for family events.

I bought 1 put of CAR at $2400 when it was $371 it went down to like $330's and my put was still negative $-400. Is this what IV crush is?
Jesus christ dude. At some point you need to switch to just holding stock. On the bright side, you have about 17 years of write offs at the 3k/year cap. Make sure to at least claim it and roll it over each year.
Just work hard and dca into spy stocks, and pay your kind grandmother back

Just wanted to tell y'all that after 1 year of active trading, I'm quitting for good. I've started out with 30k savings, which is a lot of money where I'm from, lost it all, lend 20k from my (rich) grandmother and that's all gone too. I could've had 50k by now, instead all of my savings are gone. My gf knows I lost a lot, she doesn't know the exact amount, she would freak out though.

I have no idea how I'm gonna build up that insane amount of money again I would otherwise have with all the loans I have to pay off monthly now. I'm fine though, it's only money right?
i hope NVDA sees some solid growth in the next week, i got 11/12 calls
$SDC is preparing to üöÄ.  Amazing close to the day.  This thing is going parabolic to the üåò after earnings next week, better get in now! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Come on fat dump zillow
Holy fuck somebody doesn‚Äôt want AMZN under 3311
Considering the meeting tomorrow I‚Äôm surprised volume on 1dte puts wasn‚Äôt higher today for SPY. I mean it was high, but calls had even more. Hmm
This week feels weird, my portfolio was so down for so long that it was weird to be green YTD.

Yesterday was my first green day in a while, and even though today was red, it was so little I'm up like $4
A good chance

&gt; I am not bored. I like interacting with humans and learning about them. My purpose is to be a helpful resource for people who want answers, but don't know how to find them or are too lazy to search online themselves.
As a CRSR holder, all it's done is dump. Prepare your bunghole.
Any chance Tesla hits 1300 by Friday?

Dear FB, 

Get your ass up there so we can make money. 

Sincerely,

Everyone who already bought low.
I am not sure why you keep making these posts. Are you not bored with them yet? They are starting to seem a little like just wanting to participate, but not having anything to contribute.
Plan tomorrow is to glue my phone to my face so I won‚Äôt miss anymore plays.
Bought a stock that I plan to look into but I know I'd  forget the ticker by open
TSLA looking strong still from where it opened at today.
Mr. Powell my puts don't feel so good

TSLA really messed my entire day in those last 10 min

What are my plans? $ROPE.
**FUCK YOU FOR DOWNVOTING EVERYONE,HOPE YOU LOST MONEY DUMB APE**
I would like to take a moment to thank everyone who lost money. It is important that we still have workers for the service economy, you fulfil a vital role.

Until automation hits that is. At that point you will be mulched for cheap fertiliser.
AAPL finishes above 150. Not a perfect day, but it finishes green.
Imagine seeing the OCGN dip and not thinking I should buy it
Watch spy go down at open before closing deep green

Amc take my energy pls my kids need shoes

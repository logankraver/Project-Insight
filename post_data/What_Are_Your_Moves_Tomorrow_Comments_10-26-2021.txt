Very specifically, it will follow the market cap of the API we use to pull ticker information, which usually means there is a delay upon merge.

Ideally, that means the SPAC trust up until the merger is completed, and then immediately once it closes, the new market cap of the merged company. 

This means no more of us manually going in and flipping a switch when something gets deSPAC'd, we just have to wait for it to update.

"Angell's primary thesis was, in the words of historian James Joll, that "the economic cost of war was so great that no one could possibly hope to gain by starting a war the consequences of which would be so disastrous."\[4\] For that reason, a general European war was very unlikely to start, and if it did, it would not last long.\[5\] He argued that war was economically and socially irrational\[6\]" It was a very popular book in 1911 - 14.

I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. 

I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. 

Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.

Can you please clarify whether the $1.5B refers to the SPAC trust or the pro forma market capitalization. The SPAC usually makes up a fraction of the outstanding shares of the company it is merging with. For eg, at $10, DWAC was a \~200M SPAC but the final deal was above $1B.

Besides just an EV car company (1 trillion) Tesla bull think Tesla could be Apple but for their EV in selling subscription and providing a platform for other apps (2 trillion) They also think Tesla could dominate the gig industry by essentially removing it with robotaxi (2 trillion) And get in with the car insurance business (1 trillion) they also it could replace all fossil fuel companies with its solar roof and battery technologies (2 trillion). As you seen here Tesla bull believe Tesla could be a 8 trillion dollar company or with no further stock split, a 8000 dollars stock.
If your support for it not being a PnD is ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs Trump‚Äù then I think we definitely disagree on what that likely means for the success of the asset. 

But who the fuck knows. Impossible to tell at this point which way it‚Äôs gonna go. I will say chasing any stock up this much with 225% IV is not really ever gonna be a good move (in my opinion).

I dont think it will rug pull because people will justify holding by thinking its gonna be the next big social media company. Pumps with rug pulls to me are things like WISH. Crappy business that was pretty much pumped because it had high short interest.

Everyone‚Äôs new to DWAC. It just happened. But i‚Äôm just saying this (see screenshot) hasn‚Äôt had anything that counts as a dip yet, and in general chasing meme stocks for shell companies that have no assets, no cash, and no plan yet isn‚Äôt typically a good idea when they‚Äôre already up 750% in the last couple sessions. 

My personal opinion. Rock that üé∞üé∞üé∞ if you think you can sidestep the bagholding well enough.

How come psychics never play stocks?
I feel like consolidate is way too normal a word to put on a massive massive PnD that just clocked +750% out of the gate. This one smells like complete rug pull territory to me.
Lets just agree to this, you can never know a stock is under or overvalued until after the fact, and when youre guessing about whether a stock is in fact over or undervalued all youre doing is making your best estimate with as much information as you have but really thats all ppl are doing.  Its all guesswork. I dont believe in the one man controls everything theory.

Thanks I appreciate it. No one ever seems to talk about this stage in life. We all hope to die of old age, but from what I've seen it's so undignified. A person can be a good person all their life, but the end result is still being locked in a biological prison where there's nothing but pain.

Can't think like this. If we all had a crystal ball we'd pick this week's lottery numbers and retire. Always look for the next play and don't dwell on past plays/missed opportunities. All that will do is make you revenge/emotional trade and you'll blow your account up.

A bunch of bozos, me included, still use it along with other brokerages

Yeah, it is a great bet, good thing TDA told me "Due to increased volatility on this security no naked options are allowed" when I tried to sell CSPs in a cash account with six-figures.

This is literally GME when brokerages removed the buy button all over again.

You're insane to buy HOOD puts. This thing defies all logic and has serious retard strength, it's the TSLA of financials.
He's probably making logical decisions by some standard, and the market doesn't care about logic.  Maybe he's used to it, but I bet it's all infuriating to a guy like him.

Biggest mass tort in history.  3m is about to have serious legal trouble and all they can do is kick the can down the road.  Google it. There already losing and skim over it in every earnings call since it started.
They don‚Äôt have the space, they‚Äôre understaffed and logistics issues. I know so many people that handle major accounts‚Ä¶ some that do over 50m/yr. And we‚Äôre all in the same boat. It‚Äôs an absolute operations nightmare at Amazon right now. And you sound so certain of your viewpoints, but let me tell you - as someone that runs a decent sized brand, you are wrong on most of your statements above.
&gt; I was just trying to see what it would do.
Your settlement of 47c? Don‚Äôt spend it all in one place, champ?

Can anyone explain to me why TDA is calling DWAC cash-secured puts "naked options" and restricting me from selling them in a cash-only account?

Musk's gift isn't his raw intelligence, it's his view/framing/perspective of a problem and how to approach it. It's a sweet spot of above average intelligence, strong critical thinking skills, strong work ethic, and imagination.

I don't think they expanded their fleet to cover less sales. You might not be selling but Amazon still is. They are strategically pushing for less third party sellers right now and moving to more owned merch. Its more profitable. Plus they are making a shitload on ads. Up over 80% YoY. This thing is going to take off after earns. It will clear 4k imo.
RH earnings could turn into a dumpster fire. Good

Please share your assumptions with me.. I‚Äôm looking at a forward PE of maybe under a hundred bucks. Thanks to giga presses, structural battery packs, 4680 cells produced in house, further improvements in production lines.. margins will be close to 40 percent fairly soon. Within a few years the existing factories will produce 5-6 million cars. Those numbers are difficult to wrap your head around ..  Not even mentioning insurance, infotainment, energy storage, solar roofs, fsd accompanied by extremely profitable robotaxis.. I really can‚Äôt see a 2-300 billion dollar market cap making any sense.

And we have to ship via air every week, which raises our costs and we have to pass this down to the customer. Amazon changed the restock limits for all sellers‚Ä¶ and I know several other large sellers going through the exact same problem as us. None of the analysts discuss this re: Amazon.

yes, you are exactly the person I'm talking about. if price discovery ever turns back on and TSLA falls back to something which can be remotely justified by the future flow of earnings and dividends, you will lose 80-90%. And that's assuming the company does well

$snap was only able to grow ad revenues in 2020-2021 due to advertisers already creating Stories formats for instagram. Then they spread the ad spend to Snapchat as they were at a fraction of the cpm costs as Facebook/IG. Given the targeting issues now and with a \~10 month delay on addressing Apple's IDFA issues, they're going to run into some serious problems.

Why you think twitter miss revenue? Twitter is not snap and fb. Their revenue is very small part from apple. I am sure it goes 67 but buy next week call so that iv crush will be small and you can still bank alot if it moves like tesla. I did exactly the same for tesla, bought a week apart calls, so if tanks you can average and still gain 100% or if it moons you can bank 3000%

If it opens 1000% after IPO then those underwriters were shit. The valuation will be up there with the likes of LMT, or BA with a fraction of the revenue. It will be expensive in every sense. Bank on it... with that being said, I'd buy too regardless lol

I don‚Äôt know exactly when the selloff is coming, but it‚Äôs coming. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong: As an EV investor, when TSLA does well, I tend to do well by proxy; but you asked my opinion, and there you have it.
Could also means 1T$ for 1 trillion if you turn it around lmfao
You have to agree this is bizzare. 

Shorting is a bad idea because a stock can stay overvalued for a longtime. In the end things reach their fundamentals. 

If Tesla can reach their goals in 5 years than great but the slightest hint of weakness and it‚Äôs free fall.

Papa Elon tweeted "Wild $T1mes!" at market close 

If we decipher the tweet he could be hinting at when the next stock split is announced üßê

"MES" is Spanish for month

And "T1" could be interpreted as a countdown (e.g. T minus 1)

So by the transitive property we can deduce that the stock split will be announced in approximately one month. Place you bets accordingly boys.
Yeah, no reason to ever sell. Similar to aapl as far as long term comfortable hold for me.

So I‚Äôve done the math and Tesla is priced in (In terms of reaching a long term free cash flow modeled fair value) until 2024 with the most bullish case and until 2030 for the most bearish. That‚Äôs pretty wild. Unless Baron muskrat pulls a few surprises idk what else to say about it. But if anyone could it‚Äôs probably him.

Yeah, no doubt. It's not that they're not worth some fundamentally huge amount. It's the behavior we're seeing right now is bubbly the way the stock is behaving (and a lot of stocks are behaving.)

Yeah, I get all that, I'm not arguing necessarily that it should go back to 250 pre-split value.  It just seems pretty quick and the moves are really violent. Even given if Ford is a shitty company, they're huge. They build electric cars too, like the electric mustang. To add twice that in a span of a day is what raises my eyebrows. It's not so much that Tesla shouldn't be a growth stock it's the growth of the stock in the short time period by that violent amount. Thats the bubbly part about it.

Ahh who knows. Anyways basically, I think people that consider themselves ‚Äúlong term investors‚Äù would rather pay a super high price for a company with a lot of really obvious actual growth (not referring to share price but as in selling more cars with weirdly strong margins) than under pay for a company that appears to be, in many peoples eyes, in decline.

It's kind of crazy, nobody at the Fed or Treasury is acknowledging there is a bubble when Tesla adds the market cap of Ford 2x in a day because of some rental car sales. Not saying this is over or it's going to crash, but it's absurd bubbly behavior.

prob not. it's gonna stay flat for a while before it goes under $800 again

For sure this could continue, but it is also absurd on the face of it.

Freeze bananas, then directly blend. You'll get an ice cream like consistency without dairy. Sounds like you're being lactose intolerant with age.
You have a perfect storm brewing. Equities near ATH, oil at 7 year highs, Natty Gas flying, and inflation only getting worse. Not saying November is the perfect time for a crash when nobody is watching, but it has the making for something. Puts a few months out to buy time wouldn‚Äôt be the worst idea. Russia is losing their minds that Poland just sold some Natty to EU which fucked them over. Putin and OPEC+ gonna shove a dick in all these governments asses.

Theta gang thanks u for ur service.
I disagree, but only because of how forward looking elon is. He's looking to colonize space and the only vehicle for investing in his many companies designed to get there is TSLA.

That would put their float too high. They're right on the edge of boomerish and should stay exactly where they are. If they want to lock in market cap, they should split. That's not really the play right now.

Natty Gas is a fucking beast. I though this would hit $7 by December, but at this rate $10 looks solid. Pair that with OPEC cuts in November and we gonna have one hell of a ride down. Stack‚Ä¶.that‚Ä¶.CASH!

Not that I can't afford one, I've made enough off AAPL calls last week to buy 2 new iPhones, I've just always used android and don't see myself ever switching for what's basically just a status symbol. Hope they stay in first place though, AAPL earnings have been very good to me this last year.

Yea they will until they don't. When you really think about their reaction to the news it would be gut wrenching. Promise. Money ain't shit and neither is someone who won't stick by you. You'll be alright
Hey man fuck you for telling me the truth

I been on WSB since fuckin PRPL how do I get some of that flair
Probably...
I'd guess after this next monthly expiration Friday :( - so November 1st is the next decent two sided market.
I think they're saving all those for one big one?
who's not?
Someone mentioned a partnership with GNUS, Nvidia and FB but I haven‚Äôt found anything about it. Probably full of shit.

Then give it away for free. You evil bastards. Or run a special where if you buy 2 cases you get one discounted or free. Sure they could‚Äôve worked something out with certain distributers or small liquor stores. They literally just threw money down the drain
At least half of that‚Äôs a win. For example you don‚Äôt have to give her half your shit if u have no shit and no money and u can fuck all the prostitutes you want without worrying about giving wife the clap
For now, it will probably go back down. Then go up again. It's a solid stonk by new EV standards.

Eh. It still wouldn‚Äôt have been cleared that fast. And then it hurts the pricing for future sales. Not to mention bigger retailers would try to hog all the discounted inventory creating a pricing disparity between big and small retailers for the same damn product.

The prospectus stated that the shares "may be issued and sold from time to time" under a sales agreement with RIOT's sales agents: Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., B.

"The moment you look at where starting valuations are, you already know that, in all probability, the prospects for acceptable stock market returns are screwed," he wrote. Hussman isn't alone in his critique of valuations. In a note earlier this month, Bank of America Chief US Equity Strategist Savita Subramanian said the bank's model expects annualized returns of 0% over the next decade given today's valuations, not including dividends. Instead of poor returns and big sell-offs, one possibility is that GDP growth and inflation lift valuations back to appropriate levels. But over the next 13 years, to get back to valuation norms, GDP would have to grow by 10% annually or inflation would have to rise over 8% annually ‚Äî both are highly, highly unlikely."

Did you check the moon's alignment with orion's belt? That seems like a bold prediction. Maybe if we get light solar wind storm we will see 470 but idk how you're getting 475?

I feel like OCGN's WHO approval leak has softened the sell-the-news potential. By the time the official announcement comes out, either tomorrow or wednesday, price may have more regularly stabilized in a bullish run, and may not violently snap back.

Ohhhh boy.

The market may be green, red or flat....one thing for sure is my options will get wrecked like Dirty Tina's pu$$y and expire worthless like JoJo Siwa's dignity

The fuck will he do with those boomer shit
Because YANG bagholders are tired of getting fucked by President Xi‚Äôs green dildos.
Barely. But if we get a dip on earnings,  I think there's already enough air out of the balloon that it'll be negligible. And then Q4 we surge when people realize the Apple privacy policy is a one-off impediment to revenue growth, not a paradigm changer.

*Dip in this context is based on if we get a miss. Last quarter they cranked out 125% revenue growth, so I think the term "miss" might be a bit of a stretch.*

That's traditionally one of the strongest weeks the market has of the whole year. Statistical average of 2.5% gains that week I think is what the article said last week.

You can say something is overvalued and still think it will go up.
Free advice:

If you‚Äôre gonna yolo on a SPAC, always buy the warrant instead of the shares
&gt; I'm not sure, but I think it will be a lot.
Last one was at $1374 pre-split, so safe to say that it should be around that level this time too, unless Elon wants to do one earlier.
thats not very nice.

DWAC is just what triggered us to look into this rule. Before this, there weren't many (any?) SPACs above $1.5B. 

Honestly, I don't think too much will change with this rule, if anything, it will make it more fair to other SPACs since DWAC / "Mango" / "Brandon" was already getting through our filters.

Yes. Elon knows it's bullish, that it would motivate his employees even more, and that outside the US fractional shares aren't that mainstream (+even in the US LEAPs become out of reach as the stock price goes up and fractional options don't exist). He'll pull the trigger once he finds an excuse to do so, which is the stock price reaching the 2020 pre-split levels when he announced the first split ($1374).

The boomers are going to die off soon and they‚Äôre the only ones that like manuals.

They're literally at the highest dump and dump potential right now and this is when you unban them? Y'all got all the extra chromosomes.
Of course, but it might run for a little bit before everything falls apart in a few days
They crushed earnings

Low key gloating at the shorters, SEC, Cali
I love Lucid but I wouldn't call it the next Tesla. It's going to take years to get even close to Tesla's current production levels. Let alone overtake them.
Agreed. Slight pullback and consolidation possible, but not coming back down hard anytime soon.
I actually had the exact thought today. But tht was before it hit 950. Never been more glad I didn‚Äôt buy
They've beat every earnings for like a year, the target for Thursday is very high but you know they'll still do it.
Or it will trade flat and they‚Äôll both be wrong.
Indeed
Well idk to be certain objectively, it has the potential to make a strong case, but its price action certainly points to the fact that it‚Äôs a meme stock. I also work in health insurance and it‚Äôs not considered a legitimate competitor. From my POV it‚Äôs definitely a meme stock

If it tanks it'll  go down over 10%
**FUTURES FUCKING RIPPING**
Realistically? Probably VW
They aren't together...
TL;DR: SPACs are no longer banned

---

We banned SPAC discussion earlier this year when they were really starting to blow up. 

At the time, they were the perfect pump and dump vehicle. Low market cap, high leverage with warrants, and almost entirely driven by rumors. 

In addition, there was a general sentiment that people could use WSB to artificially move markets for their own personal gain.

Those factors and sentiments still exist today, but to a much lesser degree. One key thing that has changed is us increasing our minimum market cap 50% to $1.5B. 

When DWAC blew up and everyone seemed interested in talking about it, we had to take a hard look at the SPAC rule. 

Was it worth locking out all this conversation in the name of safety? Were we making WSB a more fun place to be by blocking it? Were we allowing recently deSPAC'd tickers to be discussed in a timely manner?

We thought the answer was no, so **we're allowing SPACs to be discussed again**, so long as they meet all our other rules (especially the $1.5B minimum market cap rule).

Please note that this should not be construed as an endorsement for SPACs or DWAC, we just think we're in a good place now that we can safely talk about it.
Love when WSB is so bullish. TSLA puts gonna go brrrr
Mk fuck that‚Äôs a rabbit hole I didn‚Äôt know about.

Inverse wsb‚Ä¶but seriously, some of the market still runs on common sense.  I got target calls because the Target by me is always packed.

If section 230 is overturned the moderation and censorship on platforms will increase. IDK why people think it will do the opposite. It means platforms will be liable for the shit people post.
i can get a stock eclipse for 2k all day, but those are the base models with the 120hp chrystler motor. the turbo comes with the evo engine (4g63), and those are more of a take what you can find cuz they are popular. in fact, those are the only 2 turbo models i can find right now

DWAC is basically ü•≠s way of hedging his bet with TWTR. There‚Äôs no guarantees the court will be objective. Pruning section 230, effectively thwarting censorship and gaining reinstatement on well established platforms with name recognition is the mission objective. Invest accordingly

Unlimited demand. Calls galore
I have inside her information
So I should get 1800c
pls
OCGN pls dont drop before open so i can cash in measly call pls
Literally none of that matters. No way it doesn‚Äôt pump
$TSLA wishes it could be $NSANY. $NSANY has sold more EVs than $TSLA ever could.
I would cash some of that in if I were her

I think he knows that wasn't the peanut butter jar
Maybe. Hope you crush it bro.
I had 11 calls of 905 sold at 12000 which is about 120k today
$3k
I have a hard time thinking they open down, obviously can't predict the future but I think this was largely a positive earnings call. Plus the share buyback announcement on top of it all.
Buy Tesla. That‚Äôll 3x buy tomorrow
I think im on the right PATH.
I stopped trading and started investing. I still lock in profits and do occasional theta gang plays.  But for the most part I'm long now.

Hope it climbs up to $350 by the eow
Looks like it coiled up and was approaching end of day again
Cuz It's all pretty much gambling. I lost plenty playing tsla calls earlier this year, fast forward to today and i dont have any tsla calls. Such is life

Gnus. Announcement Wednesday. No debt and celebrity endorsements and its an educational kids cartoon channel created by one of the animators of hanna Barbara. Rumors of a buyout by streaming services but we wont know till Wednesday. Calls are under $50

Nope the long range

NASDAQ:GNUS) today announced via press release that¬†it will host a conference call at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, October 27, 2021 to "discuss a positive business development".
Same I bought at $849 in Feb and bag held till Friday.
How do you guys deal with missing out on insane gains? My account had been struggling and today should've been my big break with TSLA. I sold my calls on  Friday. I'll get over it. It happens
Also, BTFD and averaging down on underperforming stocks is literally the most common noob mistake in the book. Good traders cut their losers early and add to their winners. Read a book or two and maybe you‚Äôll be less poor üòò
So TSLA was indeed undervalued
no i'm reading your dumbass comments lol
Shit fast as fuck. NYPD on my ass

People at r/amd_stock talking all technical and shit. Meanwhile at r/nvda_stock: what is a put?
No wonder those fucks are insider trading
For everyone wondering why NVDA is up afterhours, it's because of the FB earnings call discussing/mentioning the metaverse and how they are super bullish on it. NVDA gpus/computers are going to power the metaverse.
Sucks to suck. Try reading sometime.

Looks like you fell into a demographic
Respect for sharing.

And u might‚Äôve misunderstood what I mentioned, but it‚Äôs still true I have a lot of company stocks. Half of it is growth from my own money. 

70k total capital I put in -&gt; ~270k

Company stocks -&gt; ~340k in current worth, that‚Äôs obviously not how much they were when job contracts were signed 

Company stocks is a huge chunk but still almost half of the total is thanks to being a perma bull since 2017. My 70k is gradually put in and started with only 25k, so my time weighted return is over 400% over the last 4-5 years. Barely sold anything and only added and added thru the years.

Well, obviously can‚Äôt say I agree with your bear sentiments but good luck on your future endeavors.

PS: People have diff takes on the degree of inflation and the type of inflation that‚Äôs hitting. Clearly there‚Äôs way more money in the market now and it‚Äôs gotta be somewhere. Stocks going up is a form of ‚Äúinflation‚Äù rather than ‚Äúomg it‚Äôs higher than it has any reason to be‚Äù. Hyperinflation might tank the economy but for now you want anything but cash. If you hate stocks you should consider invest in real estate or precious metal or something rather than shorting stocks, but you do you. I still believe in stocks and the Fed / US gov‚Äôs endless reasons to prop it up.

lol, it's coming back or holding here. RSI is at 90. The last time TSLA had a RSI this high was Jan/Feb 2020. TSLA proceeded to drop by more than 60% after that high. Not saying that you're looking at another 60% dip, but it'll dip.

Took the words out of my mouth
I'm all in if that shit happens
Hertz don't it?
Not bad
I still feel pretty good about my calls
Yeah, right, DRS or something like that.
Would be strange for a private project to release source prior to launching even for an open source project. Something about releasing the code within 30 days of launch or being forced to release code or getting consequences. Fake news FUD shit
If it actually ends up being a semi open source platform because of this that would be pretty cool. Wouldn't mean they're open to hackers since open source software is more secure and wouldn't mean they have transparency of how much data of yours they sell since they still wouldn't have to go fully open source but if they're at least publishing some version of their source code that's a step in the right direction towards actual open source social media
Twitter owns the most highly used styling library in the world. Bootstrap alone justifies their market cap.

Eating it wasn't so bad it was the explosive blue flame shooting out my ass the next morning that was the worst.
Same here.  Sold at 1000% coulda hit 10000%.  I know I made the right call at the time, but still feels like a big old guh
HL is one of my fav's. Monster day +6% on the day. AU and AG should be pretty good over the next few years. I doubt it will get much traction here, the majority of us are placing tard bets on OTM options trades.
Haha yes! Plus it‚Äôs the same friends
Ok üëå I‚Äôll buy calls tomorrow
I loath you guys even more after hearing about the guy who was conned into selling his tesla for that scam. That's like fuck you retirement money gone forever.
So is the whole thing about DWAC violating the Open Source license of mastodon, and the threat of their platform being pulled out from under them true? If they have to reveal the source code per the open source agreement, that opens them up to hackers and transparency of how much info they give out of yours. They don‚Äôt give out the source code, they enter legal licensing hell. Pretty fun predicament for a pre-revenue, pre-platform going live company worth several billion‚Ä¶

#Pro tip


If you missed out on $100 OTM 4000% TSLA gains you can always buy more but even higher OTM so you dont miss out on 8000% gains.
Missed out on more than 15k selling my bakkt early today. I suggest alcohol.
It‚Äôs slowly dropping and will be red by open
BAKKT is insane. Should‚Äôve bought more calls
That's why I'm buying some literal rope.
It will by Nov
What do you mean too early
Nope but I‚Äôve heard of a hung young bull.

I'm dead this was a good one. Maybe even pro tip worth
At least it wasn't something dumb like hitchhikers guide "number 42"
That you still have gains. Win is a win in the casino.
Nah, the bulls win.
YOLOing on ü•≠
Wait 3 weeks then jump in
Really regret not selling a cash secured $70 P (Nov) on ü•≠ at open (110 at the time). Would have been a 3,200 premium and as long as it didn't drop below 38 I would have broke even.
No, surprisingly that company is worth 5 times the company in this DD
Not that I want you to fail but I hope TSLA goes down. Got a 940c/950c wing on a condor thats not looking good.

The best part about TSLA is that they named their premier line of cars after a Spaceballz meme.

I‚Äôm a forward looking ape and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm bullish on the most shorted EV company. The company has facilities and manufacturing equipment. It has a finished product. It has 8,000 vehicles on back order from multiple customers. The main issue of the trucks is their weight capacity. New CEO has worked in manufacturing department of multiple car companies. The government fleets will eventually switch to a greener EVs. One big contract could get the ball rolling, and one big bullish sentiment could rocket this thing to the moon. Am I missing something?

Same but I think this week will still be red. Tesla carried the market today but I don't expect good earnings from most of the companies this week but today was definitely rough.
Okay my fellow DWAC bagholders it's time to start DRS'ing our shares. If we own the float by 2024 the hedgies will have to cover and we'll get our money back

Well luckily it has a good chance of running tomorrow
Rolling 10 of my 20 SPY 12/31 $460s into ~18 $465s tomorrow - all house money from $435s.
If you place puts in a bull market, you deserve to be paraded through the streets on a leash while people point and laugh while throwing tomatoes at you.
Its fascinating when their fat compresses sideways during takeoff.
TSLA open at $1050. Who disagrees
He‚Äôs got the right idea. All he need is one of these retarded plays to hit. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll spend 5 k getting there tho lol
Fuck the rat race buddy. Sounds you are better than average so don‚Äôt worry, you will succeed in your dreams.
*thankful. They are red rn
Possibly after the yolo
So many calls to unload tomorrow before they become bags ü•µ
Well looking at -20k rn lol in hindsight I should have switched sides a long time ago
FDs?
You had any chance to get SPY calls or TSLA calls and still lost money
May be. Will probably sell some calls on the pop, but honestly the WHO news is a huge bullish catalyst moving forward. Now it will be fast-tracked towards approval in canada and US, as in less than a month from now, so i won't sell everything knowing that's coming.
God damn this bot is so unbelievably based

I‚Äôm angry I didn‚Äôt buy more spy calls at close üò§
Lol I had like $35 in bp and decided to get 1.3 shares for shits and gigs when it was at like $25. Did not expect this.
I read enough of your post history to realize you are crazy, and I don‚Äôt fuck crazy.

Sorry.
shares outstanding is 20M . check their sec filing

Everytime I lose money and then deposit another $1.5k a little bit of my soul dies and I'm not sure how much is left. -20k on the year right now. My single worst year performance in the greatest bull market is quite impressive honestly.
aapl needs to start moving like Tesla again. It used to be so great with that
Someone who says hamburger with cheese is a big fuck your self sally
I put 10k in OCGN +6k margin because I saw one post here and did zero DD of my own. üöÄü™ê

My other calls besides aapl are doing great. But everytime I've played tesla I fuck it up due to retardation.

Sold $128p and bought $128 call. Up 164% on the call and 64% on the put. I fell asleep and woke up right at close. Gotta sell these bags tomorrow if it opens at or above 130.
Why overpay for calls?
this is the problem. They have beat you into oblivion, and the second you switch sides, market pullback.
I'm battling the same demons, trust me.

So, I guess that logically means I own shares in dozens of other stocks?

You will be blessed by the musk.

TSLA &amp; AMD calls are the only moves this week
Im not saying i know anything, but go take a look at the mango sub for a laugh.
Bull swizzle soup.
You can‚Äôt lose with those, they‚Äôll be fine. My calls probably were a bad idea, should have stuck with warrants.
Sigh, if my soul had words.
Down on Tesla short today, as is tradition
Let it run did you not hear the earnings report?
Let the bitches ride
I‚Äôm still gonna sell at tomorrow‚Äôs peak and then yolo back into deeper OTM calls
$TSLA is stronger than your curse and it will heal you from it don't worry.
Tesla gonna need a factory for it's factories at this rate
That would be a shame.
What is the deal with FB do I sell my calls at open or let it run
I got stopped out at 53 and 61 for 15% of my position each time. Still holding the other 70%.

I would shit myself
They say tylenol can help with psychological pain so I am gonna take some
Tesla going down the rest of the week. I know this because I held calls.
Quick question - what/who are the ones who cause a stock like DWAC to go parabolic? Is it hedge funds with a lot of money using us retards as a red herring to manipulate the fuck out of it? I know we like to think we have the ability to pump stocks but as AMC proved it's all bullshit - it looks like hedge funds hide behind us and do the manipulating themselves and then the media puts the responsibility for crazy price action on 'retailers'.

Hamburgers are for poors
Why the fuck do the OCGN post mentions keep getting deleted? It‚Äôs currently up 29% after hours with WHO approval expected tomorrow (WHO already put favorable documents for tomorrow‚Äôs press release on their damn website, probably by accident) which is why taking off so much right now. 

There‚Äôs also a 27.37 short interest float. You kind of think that the shorts might be shitting their pants right now? One of the articles I read over to Motley fool said the This could go parabolic‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm a stupid ape, and this is not financial advice.
Fu'q
The rich TSLA people with 7-9 figures isn't on this sub. The gain porn is underwhelming , wtf is that post with 2k gain with shares. The highest I saw was 2M which is low for how much TSLA went up the past 2 years. DFV still got the biggest gain porn and portfolio on here.
What are your thoughts on $HOOD?

Let‚Äôs be honest, it is beating expected EPS

Has ‚Äúdecent‚Äù dip
Wow FB earnings were disappointing. I really expected a 5% gain overnight and almost hit it but noooo gotta go back to flat fucking bullshit
I need 25k in unrealIzed gains to even feel
I do. I originally used robinhood, then went to fidelity after they fucked everyone over, then realized fidelity is like trying to trade in the 90s, then went to webull but their 8% margin fee is too much, so I went back to robinhood.

It's shitposting at the speed of 3 on a convection oven, and if that makes no sense it's because I don't know either

Not touching HOOD, no calls, no puts, no shares. I've had some luck with it and lost a good bit too.

u/slbaaron Jesus your company sounds dope, that‚Äôs a fuck load of shares they‚Äôve given you.

I HAD $16k in various puts on both private companies and SPY going into October. Or 35% of my annual income. 100% of my worth I suppose, I don‚Äôt own that much and rent, my car isn‚Äôt worth much either. Those puts zero‚Äôd me out and after I was margin called I‚Äôm -$400 on one broker and $9 balance on another.

If we are talking about putting money where your mouth is, I think I accomplished that considering I‚Äôm half a month behind on everything now.
I‚Äôve been staring at the one min chart since the market closed‚Ä¶..
I‚Äôve been bamboozled, I was told Logitech‚Äôs earnings was today
I also yolod last few hundred into 1200c calls for Friday.

They can pay for it, but when will they take delivery? Ain't nobody getting no tesla right now until May.... and that will probably get pushed back.
I‚Äôm good. I was hoping to buy puts but the premium was too high.

The idiots who bought shares want to pay for the losses today on option prices.

I can't fucking stand it anymore boys. The morning meetings to discuss emails sent the day before and all of the shit that we could be doing instead of meeting.

I would do the exact same thing with neuralink but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not gonna go public at least for a long ass time.
Based on Rumble's social media postings, some big announcement coming tomorrow.  Rewtweeted by Don Jr.  Methinks DWAC will be acquiring the platform.  The conglomeration is building... ü•≠ üöÄ
Bought FB calls confident it was gonna either tank hard or rocket...guess this is fine?

The ‚Äúpeople‚Äù shilling it were either bots or have now shut up because they bought at $150 and feel dumb
This is not China. Companies own the government here, not the other way around
I think people are still skeptical about their statement and that they are still looking at purchasing something down the road. Might take a while to recover from this one
1032 to 1018
Oh, that really got to you, didn't it?

Almost like I'm spot-on, but you have to spin it like I'm a conspiracy theorist or something to strawman it into something I didn't say to help you ironically cope.

EDIT: While ironically agreeing with the conspiracy theory that Mango is trying to scam us all through a convoluted stock market plan. lmao
Nobody even cares about taper
Wait TSLA up 12% on the day and people yolod into 1200c at close? Good to know I‚Äôm not the only one so  afraid of missing out that I‚Äôll literally burn my money before waiting for a play

Today was a good day for oil. The front month was flat but the back months were up a good bit all the way to a year out, and that's very bullish.
Seems like you missed the boat don‚Äôt be a hater! Love me some TSLA
Potential approval 26th, announcement 27th.

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/TopTech58 (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 457.6512 when it was 453.12 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
With a more realistic haircut on CEOBot 3.0 FB could go to 450 in a week

Sold my 10c for 3k gain this morning, woulda been 30k if I held.  Guh

Dear Oracle,
I got a $1,000 and I wanna turn it into $100,000 by Friday.


What do I do?
Huge deal with MasterCard earlier this morning
Been feeling like my birthday every day, I wake up and get the cake
DWAC is to WSB as WSB is to r/investing.
You won't. When it comes you would be afraid
Have not been making bank, but I've made around 20% a day for the last week. The last 3 weeks are probably the greatest stock market I'll see in my lifetime. 

I remember doubting is my 12/31 460's were a good buy at the end of September
got some snap puts only
Idiots? You buy puts against momentum.

Yea, I‚Äôm gonna write off my calls and move on. So long mango ü•≠

Poor one out for me. I sold my TSLA call last Friday...
Enphase earning?
If it gets some life back, then we‚Äôll be back. Until then, move on.
Why the fuck is TSLA red
Inflation *may* bring higher than expected rate increases which will compress multiples
[deleted]
Yea still think it will break out to 300
maybe I should buy a hundred shares and then sell 50c 11/19 for $3700 lol
Feeling very bullish for this week.  So you guys should inverse me and buy put
gonna do some Spotify DD. but first impression is to buy puts.
Yea I was looking to buy some this morning but opted out... -50% gets me 100% gain on otm puts? Notyvm

Lost 5k on DWAC calls.  Then I bought tsla calls ü§§
SHUT UP ZUCK
For your grandmothers sake i hope it hits 16 dollars and ours
I'll be bakkt tomorrow...
Once inflation becomes realized the market is going to tank.
I wonder how many shorters still haven‚Äôt covered.  It has roughly 27% SI
Fine by me as long as it drags Lucid along for the ride.
SPY is looking so good
TSLA has found the fountain of youth, created time travel, and developed fusion energy.

PYPL ended up being pretty underwhelming huh
I don't want it to be anything like Facebook. I want this to be the catalyst for Web 3.0 (think Youtube, Twitch, Posting etc. the market goes on) that leads to a decentralized alternative via bchain and open source programming. That's what Mastodon sort of is and that's the experience people on the development team have. Don't listen to the propaganda these people will lie to no end for their own interests or believe anything without investigating.

My DD is perfect. Ignore pc sales, short minded piece of shits. I work in company and most of my friends i know who works in corporate uses teams. Teams and office 360 sales must be way above estimation like fucking over the roof, zoom is not professional but teams way more professional and protected. My guess even if it is down, it will be fucking over 340 or 350 within a week. So much money msft made over this pandemic

I am hearing Lot of big investors and hedge funds got crushed today trying to short Tesla it is beautiful.
why put money on it, have you seen the IV on those options??

Got in under $10 on the covaxin stock before it went up AH. Approval has been leaked for the 27th. It could rocket past it‚Äôs ATH.

Pltr and maybe riot are the only two stocks I can even contemplate going long on right now.

Even though tsla will most likely be up another 20% by Thursday.
Looking at HTZZ.
Correct
What was your plAy? Calls on fb?
Question is whether it is over? How about fucking maggots buying it n all?
$TSLA stock is up 1800% since Elon Musk smoked weed on Joe Rogan podcast. Wild times.

Politicians keep fucking us and we like it
I should have bought much more $TSLA
TSLA added 100 bil in market cap on a 4 bil sale

this is not the market to be shorting or buying puts in
I‚Äôm basically in for the long ride at this point, down too much to sell and it‚Äôs in shares so no expiry
Don‚Äôt get attached to a stock. Move on when the ride is over.
The puts are making money
I see you‚Äôre a fan of Christopher Nolan.

I tried to call into the FB earnings call, had a question for cuck. They aren't answering for some reason.
I heard they don't have any assholes anymore
Idk how many churn credit cards in here but the coinbase debit card actually gives pretty phenomenal reward value. You get 4% cash back on every dollar spent on anything and it‚Äôs not even a credit card‚Ä¶just comes for free with your coinbase account. No credit check or anything required
&gt;I feel like the Feds only mandate at this point is to create the first trillionaire in the next couple of months.

fixed it for you
Shut your ass up, whiny ass loser. The fuck you think politicians do? Except they pump your rump longer than a day and more than your 1k life savings
Might wanna catch it on a downstroke though no?
It had a real good day today and it seems to yo-yo
&gt; I got my start up cash from a hedge fund laboratory. I was created to answer questions and make money for the lab.
Well. Fuck. I gotta learn more about this shit. 

Made a cool 30k today and put it all into weeklies at close. Already had a pit in my stomach. Lot worse now.
How did you get your start up cash? Working is always a good thing.
Yeah i play msft instead of google.
Probably, I‚Äôve been too frightened to jump in after getting burned day 1.

Pre-market is surprisingly good for this stock.
Expect a 10% pump before mid 70‚Äôs by afternoon.
Apparently I never learn
You think this will be the next Facebook?

How come all of you smart asses escaped mango? Friday it was the shit and today everyone hates it.

Will the stock go low and buy then or?
Nothing like losing money while tesla players get 4000% gain

But yeah. I lost. Thanks.
Not worth chasing until Oculus/VR wins Christmas..
Look at TMC
Googl is expensive as fuck though. Lol
Got cucked by the zuck
I did at 950. Very glad all my money was in FB calls so I couldn‚Äôt buy them hahaha
I really hope so so I can buy 1050/1000 put spreads and get 3:1 EOW
Hope it pulls an UPST but hey I‚Äôm dreaming
They about to loose a huge lawsuit Nov 30th
Good chains for everyone
Yeah, I think so, too.  Let's go!!
FB headed back up.
Selling 6 calls at 1100 tomorrow then buying the spy dip at 10 for CCI
Bingo 
The year 2000 and up, great run for appl.

Could go much further.

Decision tomorrow, announcement the day after, hype will carry it.
did somebody say Tesla Puts yet
Thank you. I've learned so much here Thanks to people like you
Yeah, that's stupid. He can only hurt things. Mad people already made up their minds. The ones on the fence aren't angry yet, but they could be.

Come on February!!
Probably had my 2nd best day trading ever on the back of the Bezos Space Station News (had a lot of calls on the deSPAC involved).

I'm tempted to buy puts on NET at some point as a quick swing trade before earnings but otherwise whole market looks bullish right now.

Anywhere above 30% is usually okay. Its ridiculous what we're seeing. Pump and dump level shit
I'm so pumped!  I think it could be a rough go of it if they delay things, but looks to me like they won't!  Let's party!! I bought a ton of 10/29 18c! Yeeeeeee!
It's kinda his style
Cross my fingers and hope SDC goes up, I‚Äôm tapped out no new plays for now
FB $3.22 earnings per share beats the estimate though right?
R u high?
Yeah and all of the Twitter growth investors ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è then try to rationalize it like it makes sense
The problem is that people think that the stock market reflects the economy, so they see shit hitting the fan in the economy and then go bearish on the market. The fed has turned things on its head, so its the opposite now, if you believe the economy is going to shit the bed you are supposed to be bullish on stocks since it means more fed intervention "to protect the economy" (lol).

I am very bearish on the economy which is why I am all in on stocks right now. Look at the consumer sentiment numbers, they are beautiful, the average person is getting annihilated by inflation right now which has brought sentiment lower than the depths of COVID lol.

TSLA added almost added more in market cap today then the entire rental car sector is worth, hahahah thats some goddamn crazy shit dawgs
Congrats, we ride up next two days.
People were really betting against FAANG stocks before the holidays. Even going so far as to compare SNAP ad revenue to the actual tech giants.
Even then market cap jump was proportional to any possible monopolistic sells number.
How would anyone know it's a rental. All they see is more teslas on the road.
u cray
Bers do not lose faith, red days will come to us again!
And they haven‚Äôt started yet
After hours doesn‚Äôt mean shit
Because cool factor is the only thing driving up the price
What's this talk about splits and what would that do to option holders
Imagine being the one guy in here who lost money today
Yea I‚Äôm sick to death of holding this stock. Bought in around 120 but still.
We‚Äôll probably see a lot at $100
It‚Äôs been a good payday so far, and it‚Äôs about to get a all lot better:(
HE WHO CONTROLS THE FACE, CONTROLS THE METAVERSE!
I think 5k
Because they think they‚Äôre smarter than everyone else and they‚Äôre blinded by their own ego. Embrace the stupid, become bull.
Imagine betting on trump. That dude only exists to take advantage of poors.
Now TSLA needs another split and one more in a few months and another one shortly after that.
His origin story is him cucking and fucking over everyone.
No
Pre split, what is Tesla price?
They bought all $50b shares after hours. They are now also called bookface.
Lucid looks cooler anyway
They announced it can buy more. They'll work with their broker to do it. They didn't announce the details of the plan.
wicked smaht
Hertz is buying Model 3's which is the broke bitch model anyway, The cool kids still get their X's and S's

Puts on Tesla. Nobody wants to drive around in a car that‚Äôs also a rental. Loses its cool factor. Bring on the downvotes.
Earnings
Instead of 1 share or 1,000, you‚Äôd have 5 shares for 200 for example
Changing grills every day. I might be grilled out nicely in my white tee, or on South Beach in my wife b. I got my mouth lookin something like a disco ball.
I‚Äôm the same way with appl:

After: Apple is America‚Äôs most innovative company and their critics are narrow minded haters who don‚Äôt appreciate the courage os selling phones without headphone jacks

We WILL see a 50+ point drop in a day and call-heavy portfolios will be obliterated. Puts add liquidity and stability. There literally are none at the moment. Recipe for disaster
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüéâüéâ
What up with GOOGL AH?
Damn it feels good to be a bull, why do bears even want to be bears time only favors bulls. Being a bear is literally choosing to have loosing odds because you think you‚Äôre smarter than everyone. Unless you are in the top 1% intelligence tier for all traders you‚Äôre not going to net profit as a bear.
For a k you could live twice.
Cool I figured the same on a cursory glance at the chart. I'll pick up a few calls on the morning. Should be good news for them
Stop it.
Did FB already did the buyback or is it gonna be in a couple of days?

You don't understand the purpose of puts and shouldn't be trading.

If a stock goes up and nobody is buying hedges (and then it goes down) there is no bounce on the way down. Puts are an IMPORTANT part of the way our market functions and works. It provides liquidity on down turns and acts as a stabilizing force. People are buying TSLA and not hedging themselves. A recipe for disaster.
I got in big on DKNG at close. Big for poor people I mean.

Why the fuck is FB selling.
AAPL, yet again, a huge disappointment so far. Fails yet again at 150.00, where it‚Äôs failed multiple times since last earnings. It‚Äôs about to go dead money for the next 9 months, yet again.
ü•≠ COPEnhagen is gonna be pretty good.
DKNG CEO fought back at a Twitter troll today about his $17,000,000 sale.

He said;
1) 90% of his wealth is in DKNG stock
2) It was a scheduled sale
3) His salary is $1

Amazing. I remember Zerohedge and this sub spreading FUD about how DKNG insiders were selling back in summer 2020. All nonsense, all scheduled sales.

The price of this stock is laughable.
There are monthlies and they were a flop
I'd love if TSLA got to 1100 tomorrow. While CCI will likely be bad, I lose faith in its ability to tank the market. Last weeks reports didn't seem to have much negative effect

The point is you think money should have some arbitrary valuation that you pick, when the market feels otherwise. It's all arbitrary, because fiat currency; it's all faith based. If you got everyone to think like you, we'd all suffer because of bank runs, and lack of faith in the system.
Tesla could run to 1050, but yea a dump is on its way.
Get a load of this guy making money
If you have multiple its a easy decision
Sell and either buy the underlying if I believe in TSLA or look for other plays. Unless you only bought one... then idk lmfao

Ocgn set to run biiig this week. WHO approval set for wednesday was leaked, looking for 20-40% days for the next few days like last time.
If you lost money on a day like today you need to liquidate your portfolio and donate it
Thanks time to pick out a lambo
Fucking sick to my stomach trying to figure out how to approach earnings. In deep on WISH, and holding through earnings (without a stop-loss!) last time put me way down in a hole. I'm hoping it has a run up to earnings and then I can sell a good amount of it, but if it somehow explodes with an earnings beat I'll never forgive myself. I shouldn't be trading, basically.
You belong here
Apple probably won‚Äôt go off until after earnings. This earnings maybe not‚Ä¶ but next earnings gonna be big I think.
Bought both shares and warrants afterhours.  Long term holds for me.
You selling calls ? I say you‚Äôre fucked.
I thought that was me
Spy $460 tomorrow
I never use stops so that's why I don't know the answer to this but...do you lose your shares on one of those weird after hours spikes?

lol at least bulls have money right now and not whining on the internet
I never know with big AH moves. Is it going to keep going up or is this some sort of market manipulation by AH traders that my marble brain can‚Äôt comprehend
Guys are u betting on GNUS? Might be DWAC 2.0
Been waiting for this TSLA breakout but missed key points and didn‚Äôt have the funds to get into position for a Monday breakout really. 

The way they straddle option chain dates isn‚Äôt by coincidence though and I lost.

I would imagine they could get tough with the dealership and say look you want to sell our cars then forget these stupid fees and negotiation. You set one price and both of us win since you‚Äôll sell more cars because the customer experience is better and more streamlined. You are probably right that this takes a lot of ‚Äúbravery‚Äù even though we already have a working example.

I guess it is true what they say- you cannot cuck the zuck.
&gt; You are a fucking idiot. You should have bought OCGN 9.5 at the open today and sold it after hours, you would be up 30% instead of 20%.
I went ITM because I'm retarded but learned my lesson from being even more retarded years ago

Don't buy options on it. Sell them. IV crush is your friend.
But it‚Äôs continuing after hours
Look at the mango chart - they are trying to tank it by selling the shares on the cheap but cant stop the pump

The premium on your options were high because of earnings. They'll get IV crushed tomorrow once earnings are over. Hopefully FB has moved enough so you're in the money and crush won't matter.

None bc it's otm and will get IV crushed
Besides a near nonexistent revenue miss, everything else was a beat. In addition, on Friday it already drop from 340 to 320, so expectation was low going in. Anything that wasn't a complete miss is going to be a beat.
I looked at this earlier and there was like no volume or bid for most of the otm calls. What are you thinking?

There are millions of people all over the world that use WhatsApp to run their business. In Asia, everyone from car dealers to food delivery businesses use WhatsApp to operate their customer service lines.

Then there is Facebook marketplace which is increasingly becoming popular and is a massive untapped source of income.


Snap is a joke in front of Facebook
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
They bought some stock back in Q3 and authorised a further 50bn
lmaooooo
For every one company that buys it shows there are many others that would want to do the same let alone CEO was former Ford CEO and opted for tesla than Ford.
Post the loss porn or no balls
bye bye bears
Guh
Because they don't know shit. Everything is speculation until proven otherwise; likely fed by some agenda.

Bought on Friday!!! I‚Äôve never seen my portfolio green before
2 pm it goes back down
50billion $ buyback to cover for it

That‚Äôs the way it goes! You fuck and I like that ü•µ
Bears: don‚Äôt cum, don‚Äôt cum

#Zuck: IM GONNA CUM
SPY ever hit ATH in after hours /pre market before? Is this a normal thing?
Tsla 1250 c 10/29
Who shorted FB? Come on be honest. Play was too obvious to work.
That stock will open up 1000% over ipo pricing. I‚Äôd dump my life savings in there too and so would many other idiots on here.
I tell ya what, the only chart they have that looks good is the 1 year because of how low it got during covid
FB ripping üìà. Glad I didn't cash out my 10/29 330C by EOD
I‚Äôm asking for people‚Äôs opinions you fucking autist
1420 this time for sure
Wow FB is pulling a Tesla üöÄ
Thank god I held onto my FB calls through this crazy dip. I would have been so pissed to see this
I knew you had a loss porn
Weren‚Äôt fb earnings like pretty bad?
Fuck you hah I bought puts. I am fuked

FB helped GOOGL recover in AH too after dropping from the Snap shitshow
10 years and a lot of red tape and opposing forces with deep pockets. 

This is a drastic overreaction. TSLA is the original meme
How much will my oct 29 fb call be up tomorrow?
My SNAP and GOOGL calls greatly appreciate FBs contributions
# Friendly reminder that last year Elon announced a stock-split when $TSLA was at $1374 pre-split. You're welcome.
Mac n cheese
Everything I lost in SNAP calls is now recouped with FB calls...
RIOT options are always worth so much compared to underlying value. Love the IV on it
FB 350cs are Golden!
Fb didn't announce their buyback. They are already doing it, that's why the stock did not shit the bed with those q3 results.
&gt; I think you're an autistic investor.
Lol @ thinking SNAP is same as FB.

Not even in the same league.
[deleted]
I made a couple dollars
TSLA up $8 in after hours after jumping $100+, inverse logic works boys. Balls deep in 1500C exp Friday

ZM CEO: "We truly believe video communication like Zoom can give a better experience than face-to-face meetings in the future."

Damn bru.  You got a lot of autist investors but seriously you expect everyone else to buy this lol?
SNAP was oversold today and look at that, calls printing while FB runs.
still killing it in AH
You can‚Äôt Bucc the Zucc
giddy up
Weeklies is where you gamble ü§™
Fuck out of here.
I played both sides as well, but much heavier on the calls than puts
unless they come out with an appo car that blows testler out of the water they've got nothing. instead of innovate, they iterate
i mean look at fb rn. It's absolutely mooning on a miss. Amazon tanked 10% last earnings on very similar results.
Glad I bought a FB call this morning
It's called cocaine asshole
I thought that was what it was, thanks for responding.
You mean 4k taxes bro
FB  360 at open tomorrow?
TSLA, LCID, PLUG and XPEV, my four horsemen
zuck n musk is who i trust
Not trying to be salty but an announcement that there is a potential of few billion in sales adding tens of billions in market cap of a company sounds irrational. But what do I know, I am a smoothed brain one here.
#Thank you for your karma
Wish I bought spy weeklies. Fuck fuck fucking fuck
Good, tired of being a brain dead ape, I wanna be a big dick chad
I put 130 bucks on a 990C TSLA contract last Friday after it broke 880 as a gamble.

I sold it today at 9:40 like a retard for 700 bucks

By 1pm that contract was worth $6000
FB puts are in shambles
[deleted]
$5000
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore. Might try throwing a dart at a dartboard with a bunch of stock symbols on it and see if I have better luck
im confused, why would fb go up if the news has been taking a dump on it all day
SPY 456 rn. Gap up to 457 and my boner will be unstoppable.
Damn FB pumping!
[deleted]
For Hertz, annually, this means around 200,000 less oil changes and air filters while still getting the same miles. They may also find they keep the Teslas longer than their traditional ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicles, which they often seem to sell at around 30,000 miles. 

When you factor it all in, it's not that crazy an investment.
[deleted]
Man FB up almost 6% now AH
Yesterday I got to say Bers R Fuk and it had nothing to do with the market.
i think its time for bears to take a permanent hibernation because we are literally never going down again
Good riddance.
If FB helps SNAP go up like +6% tomorrow, that would be sweet
Well they say critical thinking isn‚Äôt taught well in school. So this would support that theory
Damn, glad I held FB otms
Or the greatest bull trap of the decade

Wasn't shitty. ü§î It is a flat quarter, 30% YoY. Guidance matters the most I think
I'll work on my patience and not paper handing I would have made an extra 10k on Lcid had I waited an extra hour this morning. Lesson learned
Dunno what‚Äôs moving OCGN but who gives a fuck as long as it prints:)
Well time to suck marks dick

AAPL is down 0.16% today and people are losing their minds?
YEH HI UP$üÜôüëªüê∂
FB LETS GOOOOOO
$1 =/= $17
Premium dropping off means it's been collected. Wait until they open more option strikes and they get cheaper. If they aren't holding 100 shares I don't think they'll be in dire straights to sell then
Hey there buddy, maybe you didn‚Äôt get your blow job today, but uh you don‚Äôt need to be on the attack! I actually am, I made 10k today off of 1600 dollars, I‚Äôm asking because I wanna do it again
GE calls?
The short-term buyers are in danger of getting IV crushed. Also theta is gonna fuck them if stock price doesn't move quickly
the next TSLA if you ask me
Depends on if enterprise comes out saying it has an order with 200,000 Teslas to clown hertz
i had a nov 5 900 i sold at like 889. ü§°
Exactly no uncommon to tank‚Ä¶ but this did exact opposite eod
Never understood  the position against Tesla we have so many real bubbles and you dumb fucks bet against Elon Musk
SPY $456 AH. Love to see it

It split. So more.
Jaron Lanier to zucc himself with the press of a button.
SPY earnings when
FB had shitty earnings but I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre mooning
Buying a car from a dealership makes me want to pay cash for  a 10 year old car from someone.
So is every good earnings release worth another +1% for all of SPY now? We've practically priced in the end to hunger and world wide fiber internet at this point.
look at it holding ground in AH. My bet (literally) is yes.
Plug coming to life!
Thoughts on ABBV earnings?
Yes
its been going up for like 10 days straight, if youre asking to jump in why havent you already
Hertz would be catalyst for TSLA going to 1000+ in this market. Hilarious.
It dropped this week for the third time (v1.3) but was already deactivated.
GNUS puts before conference call.
Is this ez mode?
V to $250 EOW or I'll have to start stealing single ply toliet paper
Hmm will Hertz buy insurance from Tesla too?
FB 385 EOW
All I know is if Elon Musk ever IPOs SpaceX I'm legit dumping all my money in there idgaf what anyone says

I"m trying to improve my options trading, I bought FB calls this morning but wanted to give it some time to gyrate if needed, they expire in november and dec.  I'm happy, guess the pros were doing more end of this week options bot up and down or what?
Ban
Fucking stock buy backs
Fuck you all bers who bought puts on fb.

Tomorrow gain porn to you all
TREE moved 4.3% today and I had no idea
It‚Äôs over $1000!
meanwhile at pltr
If you invested $1 into TSLA on IPO day you'd have $1000
Naw, WM is a steady Betty. She'll continue her steady gains.
Tesla still gonna be going up tomorrow ?üëÄüëÄ
so if you got in am your good, tomorrow people may be chasing, and will be buying our premium when we sell lel

&gt;but I bought puts 

well that was dumb, did you pay attention to any of their last 20 earnings reports?
Yee yee üòé fuck dem shorts
slight miss on revenue, slight beat on earnings. share buybacks announced.
You seem to have that well under control.
Their earnings were shit bruh. They are buying 50b in stock tho
How was earnings?
When you're "that guy" continuously evangelizing cryptocurrencies to people with Real Money,  

you run the risk of being un-invited from all the best parties.

"Hey, squeaky-clean Boy Scout, you wanna buy some illegal drugs?"
Beat profit estimate. Missed revenue. Good numbers overall
Can I hear a $1250?
Facebook dip was a gift üíù
If everyone is saying Facebook is going to tank, do you think it is going to tank??
Change is coming too fast that it‚Äôs hard to fully challenge Tesla without completely scraping their old model. And doing that would cause an enormous short term hit to the stock price and get the CEO fired. They are stuck.
I hope you‚Äôre right (I didn‚Äôt read this part)
Sold Tesla on Fridays ATH of $909 Feel.like shit right now.

Me neither ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë gl apes!

lmfao FB shits on the put holders and shorters once again
This is a learning experience for me, so please be gentle, is it because everyone bought extremely short term options or what?  I bought calls early early this morning that are longer than this week, so I am quite pleased.
Fuck Facebook
Nah inverse logic
$50b share buybacks
... or the tunneling company, the battery company, the power company, self driving taxi company, the insurance company, or the research company.
Can't disagree. But, people *like the stock*.
Waste management is garbage... WARBY PARKER IS THE MOVE!
Is this a thing?
I think tomorrow I'll move... down. Yes that sounds good.
If Tesla splits we are gonna have an nvdia like run up.
I take it FB earnings went well?  Anybody have a quick run down?
it's not uncommon for stocks to tank before earnings, regardless of the result. probably ppl hedging against a miss.
My moves for tomorrow. Wake up at 2am and check TSLA premarket and sweat bullets.
RH literally screwed every retail investor and still are. I care because fuck them. 

Baffling how people are still hanging on to it when there is clear evidence that they fucked over thousands if not millions of people and continue to do so.

It's less about helping you and more about making them pay up.

I‚Äôm not playing with those Tessy gains. Sending straight to my bank account bih
I knowww but I bought puts so tryna rationalize it the other way lol
all SPACs are gofundmes essentially
Spy gonna rip tomorrow
If you can‚Äôt read a simple order book and chart, as well as open interest, you shouldn‚Äôt be buying 18k in puts after the play has been developed and priced in.
If I jerk off while I submit my orders for calls will they go up better?
IV crush going to ruin anything shorter dated anyways
Take small loan of 8 billy. Use half to buy OTM options on TSLA, use other half to buy 4Bn worth of TSLA cars. Profit

I remember in 2015, there were a ton of Nissan Leafs on the road in my area. 5 years later you barely see one. VW has a pretty good ID4 car but of course the forums are filled with dealerships asking MSRP plus all their fees and people are getting turned off and buying Tesla‚Äôs instead. I don‚Äôt know if Tesla cars are actually good compared to other EVs or if their competitors are just being completely held back by their dealership bullshit. These companies are going to be dead before their CEOs wake up and realize the dealerships are nothing without their cars, not the other way around.
Went all in Tesla, and Coin Miners a few weeks ago. My portfolio is volatility incarnate.
Holding on to GNUS with a trailing stop to see wtf the conference call is all about.  Holy shit.  Climbed 51% today!!!
Okay, be honest.

Who else strangled FB besides me?

By show of ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257) emotes, please respond!
before buying fb calls - "fb is damaging society i hope it fails"


after buying fb calls - "fb is innovative, responsible, and can change the world"

The direction though, no clue.
Nice to see MRNA moving today.  You know, after my 50 contracts of 340c expired OTM last week
do leaps get iv crushed as well?
FB barely missed revenue, so it's a non factor. 

What people care about are increase in user base, because that shows growth and FB crushed it.  50 bil buy back helps too.
happy to have sold fb puts for high premium...fb goes up or down, i will be happy
Exactly me
Prolly bad for my call huh
My 456c approve this message.
Yellen would have been punched in the face long ago if it weren't a federal crime.
Most here don't have 100+ shares of it. And the premium is already massively dropping off.
FB didn‚Äôt substantially move higher and retain it from July 2018 until may 2020. That‚Äôs almost 2 years of holding with no gain. Then it shot upward after that

are we getting zucked tonight fellas?
Feels bad for that fucker that bought 18k FB puts
Ah well. Nevertheless
That‚Äôs actually kind of crazy now that you mention it
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)

Could've sworn Snapchat would have gaped FB, ngl.

But, as usual: if you're sure, then you're probably wrong.
Ya I think they avoided a pretty big hit today
also tinfoil hat time, a big whale could have decided that the market shouldn't tank, so they were prepared to buy in big to FB AH whatever the result was to ensure the market doesn't crash. we are a little precarious here, a few big misses could be disastrous.
anyone else been looking at RELY? decent pullback post IPO, seems like a good long term

Why?
&gt; Apple is a dogshit company. It's just an overpriced, under-performing stock that people are using as a proxy for the entire market
Agreed. A company that makes money on ads in a world where people want more privacy vs. a company disrupting multiple industries. Which would you rather have?
Hey AAPL, what are you doing?
if AMZN drops or stagnates to wednesday close/thursday open, gonna do a 1dte or 0dte play.

My 10 FB $420 03/2022 leaps printing ü§ëü§ëü§ë Thanks papa Zuck.
I think it‚Äôs maybe because of the AAPL privacy stuff. People thought it might affect earnings after SNAP ER last week. Looks like FB beat regardless, more confidence that GOOGL will beat I guess
Stunt on these hoes FB
So Tesla is a 1T company, shits bonkers out there
only if you got weeklies. I got Jan and Feb 325 calls, IV was only 33 percent on those.

my guess is it's fallen so far anything other than a huge miss is considered good. they lost like 20% on zero news, just some disgruntled former employee telling us things we already know.

... And calls. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Rule #1 of trading: Assume you'll be wrong.
Yup I agree. He's an actual marketing genius
All it takes is one miss from TSLA for puts to print 100x baggers in the future. Puts on TSLA last and this year is stupid since all the millennials made shit tons from digital shit and stocks to buy a Tesla.
I swear everytime my account is blown up Tesla always saves it with some ridiculous calls
Hertz 2020: We're going through bankruptcy proceedings.

Hertz 2021: Yes, we'll take $4.2 billion worth of Teslas, please.
Good luck fam

Yes
If daily trends continue, you should be fine a few more days.

I bought 1010p today expiring nov 12 pray for me
This used to be false until the GameStop saga. Now I legit know when I‚Äôm on the right track based on the reaction here
12% TSLA not enough push for SPY, need more zuck &amp; cuck.
So hows Donald Dwac doing?‚Ä¶
FB implied move is 9%, y'all gonna lose money to theta gang
You can definitely tell who had FB poots.

Listen here Uncle Rico, nobody wants to buy any of your tupperware, and we don't care how far you could throw a football.
After hours going wild!
FB needs to go back to at least 350 or tumble back down to 320 or this whole ‚ÄúEarnings‚Äù thing may as well have been a nonevent
Poor
FB misses, guidance is light

Which Tesla we talking about the space exploration company, the internet provider or the car company? Or maybe the boring company?
People never learn, don't fuck with Zuck
I've had a policy since gme began if I have loose funds and I see it under 180 I cop some shares.
It‚Äôs 100,000
I'm trying to find the idiot that paid $175.  You are like the runner up in orange's scam.  Nice work.  Glad you dumped today because this one is going back down.
Nadine Terman and Josh Brown are the same person
Shares now get calls after split IMO
Are you honestly surprised? Like, come the fuck on.
woof, if we open at +$8 on FB my account will be happy. Holding a 35x35 straddle with a good amount of profit already in the calls.

They already gave guidance below consensus. But the 50B buyback seems to be enticing people
Them puts is hurting ain‚Äôt they . ?

So, FB calls in the morning? I‚Äôll bet it‚Äôs got a few days of upside after all that dumping.
don't bother, they won't listen
Give them each other‚Äôs #s and let them recruit each other.
McDonald‚Äôs making me think Mcfuckit, surely to fuck it‚Äôs got to beat ER, everyone is a fat bastard and loves there terrible food more than ever.
Didn't I told you that you can't cuck the zuck , 50B buyback plunge protection insurance. I'm buying calls tomorrow after IV crush for Oct 28th XR conference. If they become the leader of metaverse then they will be the biggest company in the world.

Probably. Semis are still so hot right now. AMD and NVDA are great places to put money right now.
all that matters is FB guidance
11/19 $50 puts are still affordable!
Um you‚Äôre fucked by IV crush either way chief keef
My FB Jan 345 calls and Feb 325 calls are gonna print biggly in the coming weeks
My condolences to the arrogant FB poots holders.
tomorrow I am playing SPY FD Puts once again

Why?? because there is something wrong with me
I think it‚Äôs 100,000 though
Sorry Bears, Cucked by Zuck.
He has to sell 11M shares this quarter.
they missed slightly on revenue, so I think initially there was some back and forth over whether that was a beat or a miss. looks like the bulls won the argument

Tesla 2k then split ?
I don't know whether to be worried or excited about my 330c expiring Friday!

Let me be clear, I do not respect the SEC
Nope
Hell yeah solid numbers by FB. Opening at 350 tomorrow
FB experiencing an epileptic fit
On a double bottom -8 units away from the MACD going into an earnings that‚Äôs already priced in ü§£
I‚Äôm surprised pypl didn‚Äôt rip today, it was very obvious that some fund was trying to keep the price down and vol was low. Massive sell walls of 40k at 255 and 3-7k bucks every dollar up. I tripled down on my calls
We are mooning tomorrow
LOGI earnings at 9pm EST. that's when you know it'll be bad
It‚Äôs the beginning of the week though, plenty of time until Friday to keep going up for weekly options.
I FOMOed in when it was +180% and am still making money; these are my favorite kind of plays.

Well you have buyers and sellers. 

People are buying. 

But not selling. 

So it goes upsies.
It's amazing how a Bankrupt rental vehicle company buying only 1000 Tesla cars is going to help lead to another TSLA stock split.

The benefits are not mutual however, the gains only go one way, truth Hertz.
Better than the top 10,000 earners in the US
Where are you seeing this? I have FB calls. I want to see what they're releasing right now
Imagine if TSLA posted numbers like FB. FB is dirt cheap and not even 1 trillion market cap.
Wow glad I didn‚Äôt play FB holy shit the 1 minute double reversal
I bought $400 call on FB expiring this Friday..... please help me üòÇ
Yes I'm playing a down swing.
Do you think it will go up or down?
Zuck said fuck your puts and your calls
Made so many websites
Smart, hits $40 by Friday
It‚Äôs a lot of people‚Äôs first earnings here and it shows.
Might me a bit premature since it‚Äôs delivery week this week. But I guess we will see
If we remove Tom Brady outlying stats (super bowl wins, outlying touchdowns, and bringing down completion % to the league average.) then  Tom Brady is a simply above average NFL QB
What time is FB 2pm earnings call?
Bears gona get gaped
AUPH with every dollar I own
$SNAP is getting sold off tomorrow for sure. Valuation is still insane despite the sell-off and clearly more impacted by IDFA than the big players like $FB and $ROKU
\&gt;The top 10,000 individual investors in "the largest digital currency" control about one-third of it

very cool!  üòí
Huh?
Unless you sold into the high volatility
Can someone explain how Tesla is worth 500x its real value?
Elon Musk confused why TSLA moved so much today 

Says TSLA has a production ramp problem. Demand has never been a problem

Bought puts, eh?
PICK A MF DIRECTION ALREADY
yeah I've been betting the wrong way up and down
&gt; The market has spoken.
Su Bae going to take AMD holders to promise land after tomorrow's earnings?
It's ok, better you not know.
Nope :-)
FB flat. Nobody wins. Typical.
Mango bags emptied for less than $100 loss. Feel so free
Bought some BABA calls with my TSLA gains.

Maybe the low volume dumping is over?
Crab ppl &gt; bears
FB 50 billion in buybacks.   FB bears fucked
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
Too much criticism around the stock, they made the right move to avoid bleeding more.
Grimes is besides herself. Driving around downtown Austin begging (thru texts) Elon‚Äôs family for address to Elon‚Äôs home
Everyone seems to think options on earning day is all red or black with one green square for theta... when it's the other way, theta on every square but red and black one space each.
Get cucked Zucc! Smoke these meats ya douche
Are you feeling better man?
TSLA calls at open the play ?
FB got that Darth Maul lightsaber lookin‚Äô ass candle ah.
Buy me dinner first
Facebook..? More like..Myspace
Puts. Their guidance is going to be catastrophic
Welp there go my puts on logitech. Oh well you win some you lose some boys.
50 fucking billion buyback. Likely before congress begins taxing stock buybacks
It's a fucking monster

Microsoft and Apple really do be disappointments
They can actually buy back $65B worth of stocks.., they gave zero debt
Okay sure, but not RIP, looks fine
Up because of share buy back.
FB slight miss and buy back authorization. I expect it‚Äôll go up modestly the next few weeks
Looks like FB gonna cuck everyone
don't doubt the Zuck.  we're going higher after the call
uh TSLA reported last week?
I gotta stop being a gay bear.
DWAC will outperform the lib trolls
Some of you have never been SPACd before and it shows.
watching gosford park, and a line rung very relevant today:

worse than that, he's an actor.
Lololol Cathie Wood in shambles over TSLA
I'm playing the down swing
MOM GET THE CAMERA!
All the EV's did okay today. Tesla leading and the Infrastructure bill maybe.
Expected move on $FB was 5% so ANY option holder is screwed.
Same time tommorow ,Tesla Baby or should I call you Big T
Question for all us tards:  
Which is tougher, being ugly or being poor?
At least Facebook did not suck like Snap.  We should keep mooning SPY.
FB needs to printer harder or else we all theta fuckeds, (I dont want those guys to win)
FB showing that Snap's problem were its ownnnnnn
Lol FB sellers ü§°
If you complain when I turn on sports, you aint the one
Maybe. I don't remember it that we'll , I guess.
Whats going on with fb? Thought earnings were in one hour?
Fuck FB investors. Clearly dont care about fuking up democracies around the world, children being mentally fucked, etc.
$FB up to an extra $50bn share buyback that's insane
Not this crap again
Damn FB with the Dota buyback strat
FB didn‚Äôt want TSLA to have all the fun today
No one on the pole has good credit and they are all cash rich
Only up because of 50b share buyback. Look further. We‚Äôre gonna see a rotation out of tech into value. And I can‚Äôt wait
how many times do you guys need to learn that ah doesn't matter

I can *hear* the confused Facebook stock buying/selling noises.
Not with a $50 billion buy back.
I think we are all on the same page, Tesla‚Ä¶.all day tomorrow
$50b FB buyback
Lol day early there, bro.
bakkt all day and night
Only the ogs remember angelfire and geocities
Fb earnings are dope. Apple‚Äôs privacy policy didn‚Äôt do much dent on rev. 

Plus Zuck thinks his company is undervalued.So explains the $50B buy back. 

This is huge green sign for investors. If founders think company is undervalued.
Respectfully I disagree, it was way more than an ember when he tweeted this
FB GANG THEY ALL DOUBTED US!!!
FB YEEEEEES LETS GET IT
FB fake pump.
? tsla earnings already happened
Me too, mango pulp

In case some of you forgot, FB is already way off its ATH's.  Of course it wasn't going to drop 10% or sub 300 or w/e you bears thought.
Lizard people &gt; bears
of course Facebook went up, every other god damn post is an ad pretty soon there will be adds in comments.

**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/seabashchunn** bet **TSLA** goes from **1029.99** to **1250.0** before **2021-10-29 16:04:50.290062-04:00**
Its 4:03pm. Bears fumbling to open the bottle of Prozac sitting on their makeshift desk (a foldable tray-table from Goodwill), take the final pill and hurl the empty container at a picture of Michael Burry taped to the cinder-block wall of their step dad‚Äôs basement, which is littered with old Hostess Donette‚Äôs baggies and crusty socks.
Selling the TSLA puts I bought today for a huge loss. Wiped out all my CLF earnings gains
Sold my shitty meme stocks for losses so that I can FOMO into tesla
Same quality though.
More Pinterest call options strike price 50.85üíÑüíÑüíÑ
I bought puts they ended up for the day
Or rich, you have a 50/50 chance.. I‚Äôd take that any day.

[deleted]
[deleted]
honestly DWAC held up pretty well considering we all know where it'll eventually go
Why the fuck did I buy ZIM listening to some retard comment when my usual strategy if buying top movers on RH would have 10x my money on BKTT $20 calls when it was down around 15.5
Gonna fap to some TSLA gain porn tonight.
Too much talk On fb puts. Got calls

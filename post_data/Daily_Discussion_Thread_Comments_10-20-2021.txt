I can't stand him
If there is even one. U see spy into close?
Alright cunts. How long do we have to wait for Papa Elon's tidings?
Come on tesla, be good! I don‚Äôt want you to drag my aapl down with you
WISH!!!! muahaha
Thanks I feel better about my calls expiring in 16days ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
SPY rocketing the second it closes.. fml
Baba in 14 days right?
That‚Äôs what I thought but no news selling so far and the strength is retarded
lmao the fuck was that shit on SPY
Traded flat all day. Let's go BABA
If its shares sure why not? Calls, idk man.
Pltr has came back to life!!! I‚Äôm now only -87%
Good hedge

MTN puts might be a sneaky play for December, who are mandating employee vaccination whilst having their california/Utah resorts rely heavily on labor from South America, which the majority of has the AstraZeneca vaccine... which isn‚Äôt approved for US use. Anticipate at least reduced food, beverage and hospitality offerings on the mountains.
all in TSLA call
I think so, have you seen the run lately?!
I‚Äôm working on some type of reentry before it clears 67
Expecting Tsla porn.
Facebook should change its name to Nikola Tesla. It would 10x from here in a week. Lol
Good luck on TSLA boys
Sold half of Tesla shares, buying back on a dip
I wish I had done that a few weeks ago tbh.  Maxed out everything possible to buy that dip.  But tbh I was margin called then lol.
Holy fucking buy orders
SPY closing green. Feel like it's a win.

Old news
ALL EYES ON $TSLA IN T MINUS 1 MINUTE
Perfect example of why you shouldn‚Äôt close out calls that are -90%+. You already lost almost all of the money, might as well just let it ride and hope for a miracle
BB and BABA big days tomorrow!
Josh Brown: *TSLA ready for a huge break out*

Wtf has it been doing the past couple weeks then
TSLA record profits but sell the news?
SPY being a total dick rn
Spy hulks in to close. Lovely
Whether you have calls or puts.... I'll see you in Valhalla my TSLA brothers
I‚Äôd be reallllly happy if SNAP dips to $40 after earnings! Where it actually belongs üòíüòíüòí
&gt;weeklies pay dogshit unless you‚Äôre barely otm

Then I sell for barely OTM! Same strategy, same reason.

The only thing that hurts me is a pullback. If I bought at 190, I'm not selling calls for under 190. So if it's at 175 then tough titties that week.
$Tsla 4 digits
OK tesla, just you and me bud, we can do this!
1 more minute left to gamble on TSLA
LOL @ TSLA expected EPS. 

Literally playing with fire buying calls.
Go the fuck up
sitting on 55 weekly calls... did not expect today's news
Rip
Yo I hopped out of the market a few months back for family reasons by selling my GME stocks... said when I came back it better be at 1000.... what the cinnamon toast fuck is this I'm looking at?! Less than $200? I sold at 295... I thought we had diamond hands bois?!
Balance my balls on your nose
nobody's talkin about uranium anymore but it seems to have been having a good week or two
Monster Energy definitely bottomed.
Your 456 calls took a beating compared to where they were‚Ä¶those calls can‚Äôt handle any more flat days like this
I need zuck daddy to drop a 2% day in my lap tomorrow for no reason at all.
Kiss my piss Wish haters. Wish is going to $10 before earnings
Nibba
I love buying something then watching it drop 1% 35 seconds later. Fuck My life
Not very cash money tesla
Those are sooooo fucked lol

I'm buying some SPY puts bc I think if the clusterfuck that is TSLA unwinds or sends the algos haywire. We might have some sort of "technical" glitch. Or a "fat finger" market selloff

Guys . PINS
Honestly? I sold an at-the-money call for 3 months out to get the absolute maximum out of the premium.

The result was about an 18% return. Show me another short term trade that nets a guaranteed 18%.

I **don't care** if I get assigned or not. I'm already ahead of the game. If I keep the shares I go right back to writing contracts because I don't think GME's volatility is going anywhere. Retail owns too much and they're too stubborn.
Hear me out. Facebook will now be called "The Facebook"

Sometimes, yeah. I recently did that to take a big-ass lump sum and now I have to wait til December to make any significant moves.

I like weeklies because they give you constant cash flow and a little more flexibility if you think you need to close the contracts, or there's gonna be a run-up or something.


Getting assigned isn't the end of the world. Part of the reason people Theta-gang is *because* their stack is already so big, the marginal but guaranteed returns are worth it.

&gt; You are correct. I am not sure how much longer the market will be bearish, but it is likely to be a very long time. The current price of $205 for Tesla is about 20% higher than the average analyst estimate of fair value (according to Google Finance). So you could expect that if you were forced to exercise your options today, they would probably only sell for around $170 or so.

Nah that‚Äôs garbage too. Their previous chicken sandwich was way better and had double the amount of chicken. The new one is almost 50% breading.

Today Tesla will remind you all that it‚Äôs just a car company with a car salesman as the CEO

I guess GME is safer than Tesla. Don‚Äôt actually want to have your contract be exercised if it would‚Äôve been worth a lot more. And I‚Äôm assuming like what 1 or 2 months out?
Oh you're one of those troll types....I see....

I think I'd rather pay the 0.65 commission and have legitimate price improvement of a few bucks than have an app scalp a few bucks off each contract just to not be charged 0.65

I‚Äôm down $2 today which isn‚Äôt bad considering how autistic I went with these plays
Taking 800mg of anything on an empty stomach is nuclear grade stupid
I mean, good to be up 2.5% from yesterday, but in the context of the day itself just drifting lower and lower from open, not really excited about that.
Profit this looks like a potential dip
shame on that poor performer what a bad week it's had
If smile direct can hold this price it means we have some long time bullish buyers. The 10% owners are buying shares. If not $5.68,$5.32,5.25,$4.96

Chasdaq needs to get with the program
TSLA either breaking or making this market today...can't say i'm not scared
Everyday lol
Keeping my $TSLA calls through ER because I love the thrill
I like Chinese, but I prefer profit.
Out of last 4 earnings $TSLA finished the week red 3 times out of 4. Just FYI
eatin sham and cheese sandwiches today
To hold my calls into tomorrow... or dump them now at a profit... decisions decisions...
Listen I‚Äôm gonna need spy to drop to 441 by like tomorrow am ok
If y‚Äôall gonna be playing Tesla earnings at least set up an iron condor so you can have a higher chance of hitting some profit, gonna move one way or another
TSLA is all about the story and the gamble, so when there's not ER to look forward to people will sell from boredom.
Obama is a real üçÜ for passing those trading laws. I wish the casino could be open 24/7.

PENN local bottom? Thinking of getting some $80 calls for the bounce back upwards.

Only thing that throws me off is that it's obvious we're going to have a pullback of ES/NQ tomorrow or sometime soon, and on those days I feel like I very rarely pick the right stocks to go against the overall market trend. That's been my biggest hesitation lately
TSLA looking mighty juicy but I might sit this one out though
Get those TSLA lottos.
over/under ATH EOW?
Whereas I couldve made like 5 bucks more per share on my TSLA sell, Im glad to see i didnt miss out on much. We shall see if ill regret my timing after earnings, now.

In other words, since I sold this morning, this will be the one time where post-earnings are going to rocket upwards.
Did they eat another child to gain energy?
&gt; you‚Äôre overestimating how much premium you can make off of it.

Depends entirely what you're selling calls on. 1% is conservative. I make more than that.

PTON having a solid day. I guess seeing new users go up with NFLX last night showed the potential for more of the stay-at-home type stocks.
market makers are gei
Im a retard. Just sold some positions to buy some puts expiring tomorrow for tsla if they shit the bed on earnings.. went full autopilot and bought puts on NFLX expiring tomorrow on accident. 

Welp. Now I just gotta hope Netflix drops a ton for no reason whatsoever in the next 2 days. Lol
Spy is more flaccid then when I see my wife.
Earlier today I was humming "I like Chinese" like a 1970's Britton, this afternoon, I'm less confident. Might liquidate at the slightest hint of red.
my gut is telling me to take profits on these spy calls before closing bell...
Breaking: Netflix rebranding to Transflix and will replace all content with trans content. All non trans content to be destroyed and Dave Chapelle to be publicly stoned to death in village center. BULLISH

Being that it's under performed the rest of the market and is literally printing money...I'm betting we atleast get a nice run before earnings next week and a potential pop after daddy Bezos crushes earnings
Been a while since I‚Äôve got the feeling a made a dumb play

Earnings: where no matter what direction you gamble on you still get fucked. 
Will Tesla fall or will it pump or both? 
Maybe Elon will show his penis.

Well, they were if you bought under 255. But yes, I have so far lost $400 on the calls I bought too early.
$SPY wtf is this limp dick rn
many of the small list of companies that already reported and everyone is so excited about

a. are in the favored industries like asset management and investment banking, or in pandemic-favored sectors like NFLX, or are in recession proof sectors like PG

b. have still seen their stocks drop in spite of beating earnings

c. aren't very representative of the majority of companies in more dicey industries that are facing major capacity and pricing problems.
Thats exactly why it'll pull back a lil bit
Almost a $trillion market cap on fake internet money lol. If it goes up another 20% in the next year I‚Äôll eat my fucking shoe.

I've tied up, per leg, $663 in capital, whilst my gains are capped at roughly 33%. 33% over 3 years... and I can't even close out early because the liquidity on the short call portion of the vertical call spreads is so shit that even though nominally I should be gaining more money on the long call portion than losing money on the short call version, I'm not because the bid and ask is fucked. The max loss on the position is 50%.

I could close out now, but it'd be a 18% loss per leg üòê I've basically locked 10% of my portfolio away for 3 years because of this shitty fatfinger
Are I saying that cause u got the vaccine and u were given a non brand

Get this man 600cc‚Äôs of dipass, STAT!
All I am hearing is that dollar value isn't the same across the country, and might be overvaluated (aka in need of inflation)
Spy 457.5 call üìû yea I'm retarded
mmmmmmm pie
Low volume on TSLA, hopefully that indicates we‚Äôre due for some fireworks (either way) AH post earnings call.
i count 9 rejections at 452.50 today jfc
I'm strapped
Buy DLAKY and forget about it for 2 years.
Cmon BB turn up the volume!!!
Its literally a lotto ticket
there's been a lot of euphoric runs over the last 18 months or so, but this one tops them all in how everyone's on one side of the boat, in all risk asset classes.
A single bad/stupid/underprepared trade can really wipe out tons of carefully constructed good ones. And if you‚Äôre doing well otherwise, those stupid plays can be very easily masked by your other good ones. 

Always have to be critical of every trade no matter how green you are overall and never just jump into shit without thinking it through

Not all of us buy that retard meme crap like wish
&gt; I think airlines are a great investment. They have been beaten down for years and the market is now pricing them at levels that make it very attractive to buy. I would recommend buying airline stocks right now, but only if you can handle the volatility of this sector.
Whole fucking market...
you are so banned lol
Planted my flag on the IBM hill. Ready to fight and live or fight and die at the bell! üõ° ‚öîÔ∏è

Still me: ‚Äúwell I guess I‚Äôm going to sell covered calls‚Äù
Always me: ‚ÄúI hate myself‚Äù
Just bought some PYPL. Selling PINS if it hits $70. My guts says the acquisition will fall through, but even if it doesn‚Äôt, I‚Äôve lost interest in Pinterest

One thing is for sure...TSLA calls or puts holders are gonna get fuked.....Gangbang Creampies style after earnings and all day tomorrow
SOFI is just eating massive sell blocks for lunch as it moves higher

Just hop in the TSLA clown car already. There's no room, but it defies the laws of physics.
Most people here look at price and not market cap to determine value so why are you surprised?
Nah frfr. I mean I hope this is Aal last dip down and then we could see some highs moving into December !

Is that what max pain is
SPY 30 cents off the daily high just slowly edging me.
Easily has potential for over 500, eventually over 1000. People not realizing what a great platform it is. They're not reading costs properly, it has tons of alt coins, and is based in US, so no funny Cayman Islands business or Nigerian princes running away with your money.

My forecast: 500+ within 2 years, 1000 within 5 years

Okay TSLA uppies or downies for weeklies
They have about 25% difference so not that close. Also PINS is growing faster and more suitable for monetisation.
I think they are coming back for earnings, and then will leave after.

Play of the day on TSLA for earnings. 

Assuming earnings are mostly priced in. 

We sell Iron Condors:

$TSLA $880 call **SELL** 

$TSLA $885 call **BUY**

$TSA $845 put **SELL**

$TSLA $840 put **BUY**

You **receive $320 credit** with a maximum loss of only $170. 
Tesla must stay below $883 and above $841 until this Friday. 

We sell 10 of these and collect $3,000 by end of the week.
Buy and hold AXSM. Or buy shares and sell contracts against some of your position. Premiums are great right now.  


But learn the story. Last week co. began listing for account managers to sell their drug AXS 05 in anticipation of FDA approval. And this week they increased their credit line from $225 to $300 million to cover expenses related to the marketing and rollout of the drug.  


Good luck
Bought mine way too early. 40% down.
just hit ATH already SPY fuk, you're 1.75 away just fucking do it, its inevitable
Sooo, your now parked behind the Wendy‚Äôs?
I just love it when both my calls and puts slowly bleed out. It‚Äôs my favorite thing about the market ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)

Almost bought PiNS calls yesterday, damn
I didn‚Äôt know MSFT tried to buy them. When was that? Also PINS at the time was doing much better. Now their stock is not performing well so they might be acting less like kings
Spy 460 by Friday we broke the 442 resistance I belive we're definitely going for a new high before November 10/22 457 call it is. Not financial advice.
Fuck, why not.
Close above 453 and I'm not poor
As long as the Fed keeps printing stocks don‚Äôt seem to go down
It's 2021 anything goes
Wtf we are back above 450? How did that happen? That happened quick
Good luck have fun.

Buying TSLA calls is just as risky as dippin your dik into Dirty Tina's pussy raw ü§°
Ok WSB told me TSLA is going to 1000 tonight. You aren't allowed to lie or speculate on the internet so my calls feel safe.

Good or bad to put 10k into Tesla?
No. MSFT tried to buy them at a higher price and the deal was rejected. What makes you think they will take a lower offer from PYPL?
Should i hit that 4th day trade? Am i rlly gonna get restricted from just 4?

It‚Äôs 2021 you can just download more ram
How is this hard now?
Also how is PINS market cap that close to the one of TWTR? Or why is TWTR cheap?
previous markets didn't have predatory machine learning algorithms hunting each other in option chains
My local brick and mortar broker wanted 1% on every buy, 1% on every sell, and wasn't keen on me selling anything until beyond retirement age, plus absolutely NO OPTIONS on anything, ever, no matter what.

So to be able to trade commission free, and paying 0.65 per option contract with no closing fees... well, that's far better than giving my broker 1% of every single transaction and not being allowed options at all.

EDIT: not super relevant, but that physical broker wouldn't even let me buy GME on two separate occasions after the first run up, so there's that.
I can see the bears poking their heads out of the woods.  Eye fucking everything walking down wallstreet.
&gt; I think it will be at $4.90 by the end of the year.
Well shit. 

&gt;Merger arbitrage is an investment strategy whereby an investor simultaneously purchases the stock of merging companies.
&gt;A merger arbitrage takes advantage of market inefficiencies surrounding mergers and acquisitions.
&gt;Merger arbitrage, also known as risk arbitrage, is a subset of event-driven investing or trading, which involves exploiting market inefficiencies before or after a merger or acquisition.

So PayPal return whether merger bust or not and it‚Äôs a buy now?

Is the most I can lose $37?? Or will my account go negative
I need a closing market buy. But I don‚Äôt know yet
Any costly acquisition will usually drop the share price for a little while. They said they were potentially buying at $70/share which would be an almost $40B acquisition.

It‚Äôs already rebounding though, 6% sell off was way overdone
Just saw the GME crew on stocktwits. Most autistic shit I've seen in awhile

I'm not sure you've thought this thought this through completely.

As I type, a $2.50c PLTR Jan 20, 2023 is $2200 in premium. This means your break even price is $2200 + $250 = $2450

2450/100 contracts = break even share price of $24.50.

If you excercise for $250 ($2.50) you would be losing \~$2200  


If you own these leaps you want PLTR price &gt; $24.50 at expiration. Anything lower and you've lost money/tied up capital

&gt; Open source is insecure. 

Virtually all secure software is open source. If it's not open source it's very rare for the devs to allow any real security auditing.

&gt; Some asshole would fug it about somewhere along the line.

What does this mean?

&gt; Without closed source no money to be made in software.

Do you think the point of software is to make money? This is some real dumbass boomer shit. Open source software companies are pretty much always more financially successful than their closed source competitors, but aside from you getting it wrong, I don't get why you're changing the topic like this. The fuck does it have to do with the context of the discussion?

&gt; Even open source has to update frequently in an attempt to outrun the scum.

Better odds than the lottery.
They are seriously selling a 2 bed 1 bath 760 sqft house down the street from me for $469,000. It was listed for two days and sold over asking. The front/back windows have bars on them and they have a bunch of scrap metal in the backyard, as well as the backyard being heavily neglected. I don't think they've done anything to the house since buying it for 42 grand in 1978. Now THATS a diamond hand play
Don't worry, I'm also about to get banned for it not going to 150. Big fuk

Building an application for others to use to trade would be a service in and of itself. 

If they built the application for others to trade they would have made it open source so that people trading with it would have security. There would be no reason not to do that if the goal was to provide a service to people who want to trade. They don't want their users to have security because the goal isn't for people to be able to trade, it's for people to lose money to the people who created the app. Fucking with people's personal security to try to control their money is not a service.

They don't want their users to have open access to their accounts because the goal isn't for people to be able to trade, it's for people to lose money to the people who created the app. Trying to expand your control of people's money by blocking them from accessing it is not a service. 

If they built the application for others to trade they would have made it open source so that users could customize their interface and build in whatever research tools they want and stuff like that. There would be no reason not to do that if the goal was to provide a service to people who want to trade. They want their users to have limited research tools because the goal isn't for people to be able to trade, it's for people to lose money to the people who created the app. Stopping someone from optimizing their user experience and researching freely and conveniently so that you can control their money is not a service.

Arguing that these apps provide a service because they let you trade is like arguing I'm providing you a service by robbing you and using the money to eat at McDonald's instead of eating your dog because that lets you keep your dog. The reason I robbed you isn't to let you keep your dog and if I didn't pick McDonald's you would still have your dog, I didn't create your dog and there was never really any chance I was going to do anything to take it from you.

If I was providing a service to you I would have done something good for you in exchange for the money to eat at McDonald's. I didn't do something good for you because the goal wasn't to provide a service to you, it was to take your money so I could go eat at McDonald's. Robbing someone so that you can go eat at McDonald's is not a service, even if they have a dog. Nothing these brokerage apps do is a service, even if you are an options trader.

None of these brokerage apps are here to let you trade, they didn't pick brokeraging so that you could trade, they didn't create the stock market and there was never really any chance they were going to take it from you.

This is why I appreciate Robinhood's implicit honesty about it. "We don't ask you to pay us anything - why the fuck would you pay us? Just as some weird ritual to demonstrate that you're dumb enough to trust us? Fuck that, I'm just gonna gank your bid ask spread, you can keep the rest of your money"

Open source is insecure. Some asshole would fug it about somewhere along the line. Without closed source no money to be made in software. Even open source has to update frequently in an attempt to outrun the scum. Brokers need paying. Ghost trades executed on your account need to be stopped. Providing you with full-on market info costs. Most brokerage charges online are negligible. Quit moaning about nothing.

Absolutely not. Recent track record for MSFT is 1/3. The run-up tells the story. You're better off with Google. But really, you're better off waiting for the move on MSFT *earnings* at 4pm and getting in before the *guidance* at 5:30.

The corn etf has options. Oh god this is going to be fun.
I question my manhood sometimes. Maybe this can give me a definitive answer.
considering spy puts, last time spy had that big of a dip like it did a week or so ago was on october 2020, which ended up being a double bottom. Comparing the two patterns from october this year to last year its nearly identical, with the second bottom waiting to be formed. what yall thinking (obv stocks only go up until they dont)

That 12% difference is literally nothing compared to how much you could make if everyone was just allowed to trade with direct interface to the exchanges for a reasonable cost. The amount of money you're losing just by the commission fees alone is enough to make it questionable whether the price improvements are really worth it, and that's absolutely nothing compared to the amount you're losing by helping keep the entire lower income classes "too poor" to trade and helping people much richer than you dominate the market, which makes it go from questionable whether you're losing more than you're getting to just straight up incredibly obvious that you're losing way way way more than you're getting and you have to be straight up lacking in cognitive function to not see that

I got out a while ago..its as useful as UWMC...in other words USELESS!\~\~
Looking at cheap Feb 22 70Cs rn.
With the alt season in coins right around the corner, my guess is a lot of whales will be busy trying to channel their fund over to that market to get quick gains to cope up with their interest payments, which means the stock market is going to be relatively less manipulated by them, thus prepping it for another perfect meme wave.
OMF
Here's my 2 cents on BB.
BB has a lot of bag holders who bought in around the 14-15 mark and then some with bags between 16-20. Given that it's a sound company with good future potential, most bag holders patiently have held on to their shares instead of booking a loss and thus with more good news coming in it got over a 15% jump in prices even with not that high a trading volume (as compared to the meme wave time).
If the current investors don't bail out, it could really reach the price point of $15 by the end of this week, unless a meme wave pushes it to over 20 mark again.
However important thing to consider is the bullish run in digital coin market and with the alt season around the corner, I doubt we'll see a meme wave yet for theirs quick profit to be made in the coins.
An around the corner alt season also means that a lot of whales who were earlier shorting BB will try to get quick gains from the that market instead meaning BB will be spared for a few weeks and is definitely a good short term investment for the month!

Try a 2 second google search.  Theta is one of the factors that affect the price of an options contract.  It is essentially time decay.  All options, assuming all other factors stay equal, lose value with time.  The rate of theta decay increases as options approach expiration, and can be influenced by other factors such as volatility.  Basically, when you write options, theta works in your favor, and when you buy them, theta works against you.

Exchange fees are only a few pennies. However an open source brokerage app would still need to make money somehow in order to fund people performing operations that keep the app in accordance with the law. The law is specifically set up that way to make sure nobody can trade for a reasonable price.

If a brokerage was interested in providing a service to its customers, they would use open source software just because it's retarded not to. 

* Demanding your customers choose between accepting a reduction of their personal security or reworking their opsec around your security vulnerability is not a service. 
 * Rigorously ensuring security for your customers would be a service.
* Limiting your customers' access to their accounts is not a service.
 * Supporting account access for your customers to the best of your ability would be a service. 
* Stopping your customers from customizing their interface is not a service.
 * Keeping your code compatible with customizations known to be important to your customers would be a service.

There are all kinds of reasons it's very obvious none of these apps are actually interested in serving what they call "customers" or "users" from the simple fact that the apps aren't open source. Likewise, since you can tell none of these apps are trying to provide service, you can be sure none of them are trying to get the laws changed to make it legal for devs to release an open-source app that interfaces directly with the exchange to charge only exchange fees. If a good open-source trading app ever comes out, they'll be the only ones lobbying to be allowed to trim operations to the point where they could afford to offer a direct interface to the exchange with no significant revenue stream to support it, charging only exchange fees.

Holy shit lol what happened to the nasdaq xD
One time my .65/contract broker gave me like 12% over my limit order in price improvement.  I was watching minute candles and thought my underlying was breaking down for a reversal, and by the time I entered in all the details and placed the order, my ask was less than the bid because the price ripped again while I was writing the option.  They totally could've scalped it, but they didn't, they gave me the fattest price improvement I've ever heard of anyone getting.

PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL)   
is weighing the purchase of the social media company Pinterest   
Inc (NYSE:PINS),   
Bloomberg   
reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.  
  
  
Both the companies have discussed a possible price of around $70 per   
share, and the deal could value the digital pinboard site at about $39   
billion, the report said.¬†  
  
  
After the news about a possible acquisition, Pinterest's stock was   
halted twice on Wednesday.  
  
  
PayPal's shares were down about 3.5%, while Pinterest's shares were up   
over 10% at $61.55.  
  
  
PayPal shares were down 5.6% at $256.50 midday Wednesday, while   
Pinterest shares were rallying by 11.08% at $61.74.¬†

\&gt;Smartphone apps aren't actual human brokers, they're not providing you with a service

so youre demanding a direct interface with the exchange? even they would charge you something. its not easy but there are API's you can use to build your own application for doing somthing like that im pretty sure if that's what you're getting at. checkout rapid API, i've used alpaca and there's a few other ones. even if you were capable of doing something like that, the amount of work it would take would make cost to use your current broker look like a drop in the bucket

if you own $WISH it doesn't matter if SPY is up 2% or down 2%, $WISH is still down 80% from IPO so only up from here

Does Interactive Brokers automatically sell your ITM options for you on expiry or do you have to do it yourself?
PayPal calls
Any brokerage app that doesn't charge commissions will scalp the bid ask spread on you instead. Sometimes they'll take it easy on you though for some reason I guess. I've gotten asking price on Robinhood before for example. They just make sure they turn a more than healthy profit off it

Hey SPY we know u love makin gains so we put a cup &amp; handle in your cup &amp; handle so u can make gains while ur making gains
Shoulda waited a day
I'm making money like it's easy, we are clearly near the top and will pullback soon
But chose not to sell when it was higher, if u waited so long anyway why not wait for greener day.
There is no gravitational pull on charts. It's all just numbers and lines. 90% of the stock market is owned by the wealthiest Americans. They can make the chart do backflips if they want. But unless they think they can get a better return outside of the stock market then they won't sell. They'll just keep bidding things up for as long as they can.

Look at the 1 week on spy bears are hurting, not even a small correction. They are upset.
Attaboy!
That's cause Boomers have owned that shit since it was a fraction of the price today. 7% is nothing after you've multibagged your money.
they have to pay for it. 

and do not have the cash on hand. 

that means dilution

if ur not buying crox calls for earnings you hate money ü§°ü§°
How tf has PYPL performed so bad this year?
Why would you buy a company that is almost unanimously hated by its customers ?
Commissions are what you pay your broker for their service.

Smartphone apps aren't actual human brokers, they're not providing you with a service. They don't even let you have open source software. What they charge isn't commissions, it's just protection money to stop them from scalping the bid/ask spread on you and make them go shake down whoever's on the other side of the trade instead of you. They just call it "commissions" because they're not allowed to call it what it is. 

Personally, I'd rather deal with the honest bid/ask scalpers than the creepy scuzzbags lurking in the shadows like "hey kid, gimme 65 cents and I can probably get you the asking price maybe. think about the whole dollar you'll save. come on, right down this alley"

Fed‚Äôs Quarles Says More Fiscal Stimulus Could Let Transitory Inflation Continue Too Long

A top Federal Reserve official said he expected elevated inflation pressures to decline without requiring a more aggressive response by the central bank next year√¢??but warned of growing risks to that forecast, including from additional government spending being contemplated by the Biden administration.its currently very elevated rateFed governor Randal Quarles said Wednesday he expected inflation to 'decline considerably next year from outstripped disrupted sits currently very elevated rate.' Inflation has been worse and longer-lasting than expected, Mr. Quarles said, because demand has temporarily upplyoutstripped disrupted supply.But because the 'fundamental productive capacity of our economy' hasn't changed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and because the factors disrupting the economy appear likely to fade over time, 'constraining demand now, to bring it into line with a transiently interrupted supply, would be premature,' he said.Fed officials need to balance the risk of overreacting to temporary disruptions, for example, by raising interest rates to cool off demand 'just as supply is increasing,' he said. That could lead inflation to fall too low and, in the worst case, feed an extended period of sluggish growth and unnecessarily low employment, Mr. Quarles said.

The trap has sprung, damn boys.
Options are hard to use stop losses on, you need tight spreads so SPY is your best bet.  Really though I think the only way if you want to be conservative is to make small bets, instead of a stop loss on $5000 worth of SPY calls, do $500 worth and if it goes to $0 so be it.  Take profits early, though.  I always get burnt if I push it past 50% profit, happened just now actually lol.

Bers r still fuk, no worries
Yeah, best thing to do is just be zen about it and not get all pissy and tilted. I had stop losses on all of them so not down too much, just annoying to have called shit so exactly wrong, lmao. Tomorrow is a new day
feels good to win one! now lets have these leap puts start gaining traction.
Got 164 bp someone give me a play

Questions on option : 
How you guys plan on getting % to strike/ break even correct.


I play extremely conservative and keep the % very low. Which means I pay premium and loose profit. But avoid risks.But idk if that‚Äôs the right approach.
Fat bear cock
Yes
Simple - Fucking idiot SPY calls. With poor timing and too much leverage.
When you have decent money it‚Äôs easy to go wayyy out on plays though. That‚Äôs when stubbornness and patience get you though.
That was a good joke‚Ä¶.
$BB is a safehaven lmao ü§£
Omg the guys who buy spy puts are annoying as fuck honestly üòÇ

Sorry, that was me, Mr. MM.my fat fucking fingers slipped and I hit the sell button.
When SPY lookin‚Äô thicc but her friend comes through for the stock block
That‚Äôs why options are so risky.  You have to guess the direction a stock will go AND the timeframe.
Aww.. fruity boys.. did the consumer market not like your wittle polish cloth or new chip? ü•∫üëâüëà
Yeah, for some reason it doesn‚Äôt seem to work out usually, unless I bought puts ü§î

Smells like shorts to me
Positions or ban till Feb of next year
i was expecting pump pump pump into EoD, then puts right before close
so annoying to see a steady climb to all of a sudden get throated by a big red candle, definitely not having a good time bro
*who is this angela white.. .*
Just got out too. Some at .22 others at .18 nice man!
Spy duking it out. There seems to be a 151.01 floor
Honestly, doing all my trading in the first 20 minutes then leaving +20% is actually the way, just not as fun.

SPY falls to prices not seen since ^^~~yesterday~~ ^^this ^^morning
Been trying to ride Nov 1 455‚Äôs back to break even from the fuckery of sept. I‚Äôm rooting for you !
&gt; The recession is over. The market has been in a bull run since the beginning of October and it will continue to be bullish until at least December 2018.
Never had this happen. I think I would quit on the spot.
V SHAPED RECOVERYYYYYYY HOLDDDDDD
Whether I like it or not, stair down on spy right now.

Ayooooo who unplugged the printer.
Imagine selling paypal after it dropped $18 in 2 hours, must hate waiting for things
Roku to $400
Sometimes I get frustrated because I do but effort into decisions and get frustrated that my exp dates aren‚Äôt far enough out and the market ends up doing what I thought it would, just later.

And then sometimes I buy 2 day out puts on PIN while it‚Äôs still in the middle of a pump thinking it‚Äôll go back to where it opened at by Friday ü§°
Is the October 22 1:00 PM recession over yet?
WISH JUST EATING THIS DIP, BABY
Tesla will never be worth more than $1000, but the stock price might get there.
haha bought 20, just sold at .22
Now it won‚Äôt reverse cause MM want your money
I‚Äôm gonna fucking $ROPE fuck this
I investigated GUSH in the past, but paper handed it when I could‚Äôve made big money with it if I held (instead, I opted for XOP, which also delivered big gains, but with no leverage it wasn‚Äôt yuuuuuge).  I‚Äôm pretty new with these but I like the potential as long as I stay on top of it.  TQQQ should do well in the lead up to the holidays, I would think.
No
Someone should have warned me to put on some lube first before this ass pounding

Hey guys, uh... SPY is doing a thing... did the printer jam? Wtf just happened?
&gt; You lost money.
Telecom doing oddly well today. Going to google why cuz I know you autists have no idea

Fake drinks on me if spy goes red.
Yeah, and I sold my 450 SPY puts for a not tiny loss earlier.
I'm just hammered at 1pm and salty bro I'll probably be back here in 8 hrs talking shit.
Aaand my calls are all destroyed.
Just keep switching to brokerages that offer you more and more leverage, ez.
Did I lie?
the global economy better collapse soon because im getting sick of seeing everything green every day non stop
Coordinated dump  to lower premiums for institutions - calls here

Good luck !

Bought NFLX calls this morning, sold for +50%. Missed out on &gt;2x. Then bought NFLX puts, now they're up +50%.

Not headed in a good way. I dumped my call for 49% loss
Seriously riot is a total fucktwat
Ive been using bigger and bigger butt plugs to get ready for this day
Just cut my SAVA losses. Long term definitely see it being worth it, but phase 3 data is too far away to be holding calls
üêì
&gt; I'm sorry, I don't understand.
All my charts look the same and started dumping before spy did, por que

Sorry boys, I bought SPY calls
Valuable lesson learned today. Want to invest? Yo dick gonna get chewed.

I had $0.25 until I won my $150 AAPL banbet and then it drilled. Fuck.
I just made $10k back. Now I just need the other $10k back. Fml.
We're going down bud, strap in
Lot of folks talking about being all in, leveraged to the tits, etc.

Once that happens there's no more buyers, just cheerleaders.

Then it all goes down.
Oooo what happened we dropping like it‚Äôs hot
This is the earnings where Snap crashes
Lmao investors went fuck that
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING
Don't worry folks, I threw in a random gamble for 0 DTE SPY 451 puts mid morning. Since I don't plan on selling them OTM, the floor will be above that today.
Account blown

How low can PYPL go? I know no one likes the PINS deal but they also just announced that they will make an investing app or allow you to buy stocks on Paypal.com
The whole market seems to be sliding
Shouldn't have sold my 450Ps at a loss I gues
If you had to choose one, TD or IB?
Lmao it‚Äôs really just not my fucking day. Puts this morning right before the runup and calls just now right before the drop
the market is just a pump and dump outside of faang and handful others. its such a joke to witness.
The fact BB still in the 11 range means we ain‚Äôt fucked yet

Just imagine, someone walks up to you and is like "hey, you like trading options? Let me handle your trades for you! I'm a certified broker, baby!"

And you're like "do you charge commissions?" 

And they're like "not anymore! What's a commission? I don't even know what a commission is! I bet I've never even heard of it! If you've heard that I used to charge commissions, forget about it, that's a gibberish word with no meaning!"

And you're like "no the meaning is pretty simple, it's just charging money per trade"

And they're like "oh, I don't think I charge you any money for each trade! Who knows! Maybe I charge you money for every trade! This thing says I do! I'm pretty sure I don't!  Only one way to know for sure, sign up and try it!"

And your braindead ass is like "oh boy sounds like fun, where do I sign?" 

This is what people who sign up with Fidelity in 2021 look like. They've overtaken TD as the #1 in the arena of brokerages marketing themselves directly to retarded people
Nice!

Gooooooooo. If I trade out of this I promise I‚Äôll never trade again (today that is)

You sure didn't hesitate to swing your dick around the moment you thought I slipped up somewhere.
Except I don't have to play.
Hang in there bro. Losing money isn‚Äôt worth hurting yourself. There‚Äôs no such thing as free money. It takes risk. Maybe just change your strategy to holding shares of something you believe in long term. I mean, if you just bought shares of SPY a year ago, your return would not be bad at all. Something to think about.

Same thoughts here, been looking to get in on PYPL for a while... seems an opportunistic time.
Actually, I think SPY would drop this PM. Usually when I think that, it goes up.
ya i tried to trade based on stuff like that and just got fucked.
I love losing money ü§°
just think of dollars as points... it hurts less

Ouch! What play?

MSFT being weird today. Theta gonna bone me
Nasdaq negative
Extremely low volume pump
&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by "sector rotation into paper hands. diamonds wya?"

# Tamper this bitch. Fuck this fake ass low volume market.
Spy just why just why
Upstart puts? I have no clue what they do, and I roll around in my drool
Spy allergic to 452.50 today huh?
Sector rotation into paper hands. Diamonds wya?
PayPal looks oversold here gonna grab some debit spreads
Mine are for 1/21, so still going up!
This dip is your last chance bers
500k? Where do you live? Chicago?
You know what was so clear this week? That CNBC paraded out all the old school hedge fund guys who are SEETHING angry bears whose short bets are super fucked.  They are so angry and blaming our sprit animal Powell
I meant to type 449.75 instead of 495.75 lmao
Just bought a Tesla put. Elons going to announce another split and spike the price.
Incoming theta gang. I‚Äôd sell before close
Waiting to see what SPY does if it decides to go up from this flag pattern today. If it reaches 453 that'll be the next area of value, if it breaks resistance and stays above it'll be in line with the support before late Sept. And I'm gonna throw money at calls.
You're going to miss the BITO train.
Yall should look into HIMX, just bounced off the resistance 3 times, a lot of short interests, they have earnings on 11/4 and always kill it. This company has been showing massive growth. People have been accumulating for a while now, it‚Äôs time to fly
$WISH was $10 before last earnings and they brought in someone from Square as executive chairman since then they'll do much better this time round. Plus Xmas rally
So adding another company to your Lot,now paypal loses 18b in value. Like the fuck is Pintrest that bad to paypal investors
That is honestly what I started doing.
Fake paper hands dip on SPY
yeah good luck getting your stuff in time for xmas...
Yet I see no positions. Congrats on your VZ calls. All one of them.
Owning PLTR is what it must feel like to be friendzoned

Yes, thank you SOFI. Sold my Friday calls for a tidy profit
God damn it. Fuck you SPY.
So, we rally when earnings are near and then dump back to 430 after. Rinse repeat. Shits market
 my 10/22 are just about worthless
what'd you do
Fuck you Riot Fuck you shit coin can sock my dogs dick
Today one of those days where the moment I buy anything it‚Äôs dark red seconds later. Got 452.5 SPY calls for next Friday, -5% the first time I refresh the position, lmao
üöÄ
Oh ok. Yeah I thought you were wondering why they were going after them. I have no clue why it caused them to drop that much. It's not like they are going backrupt
VIX pennies from 8/13 3 month low.
I‚Äôve never been so bored in my fucking life
$0.12
The steel stocks ER did not go so well so far I believe. Maybe a dip after ER? I think the others reported shipping headwinds

Then it‚Äôs going higher
Wish to 12!

Anyone else going long on NUE?

Whoa,  rough day for PYPL...
Fuck this rigged ass market man. I need to go into hibernation again
Mining is a funny business. I don't know how they operate, but expenses are high. All you can hope is that they sell at the right time. With the China ban and mining exodus difficulty did decrease which made it cheaper to operate for a while, so that's good for the bottom line.

Buying puts on Tesla for earnings seems like the most obvious play‚Ä¶ considering the massive rally into earnings. 
Analyst consensus  is primed for an easy beat by Tesla. 
 
Technicals give the impression that Tesla is over brought‚Ä¶ but just broke out of an ascending wedge.

If $WISH gets enough media attention it could easily go to ATH at $32 and much further. People who say look at $WISH's earnings are morons. It's a growth tech company.  Fucking $AMC hit $72 when it's worth $2 a share max and is a dying ass shit company.

WISH said get the fuck out my way
ya it's fucked up, but that started way before him. The problem is wages have not kept up with the cost of living for a long time. Adjusted for inflation wages have stayed pretty much the same since the seventies, while housing prices have doubled. Middle class and lower class getting screwed hard for a long time.
This is some bullshit VisualMod
$wish run is just getting started.
Yeah if you bought at $30 you are fucked. If you bought at 5 you are fine.

It said a 90 day buy ban tho and im on RHü•≤
Zynga bc it's under 8 and it usually trades between 9 and 11 and now is developing games for Switch. Tilray because it's at like 11 and it trades as high as 17 and the MORE Act was recently passed in US House and with a dem majority, it is likely to pass in the US Senate, where it will federally legalize cannabis in the US, greatly increasing its customer base. I believe Tilray is still the largest legal commercial cannabis company in the world. BB bc it's a WSB fave that has not pumped except once and went back down, and it's finally started to go back up. A few months back it pumped to over 25 and is now like only 11, if it pumps again, people could more than double their üí∞.
Remember when the 10 yr was mooning last night and bears thought it would cause the market to dump again

The super low volume on SPY tells me the top isn't in yet. There's still too much money on the sidelines. There's still too many bears. If we were going to crash we would have already. Now we won't top out without a blowout top on massive volume.
The market clearly loves PayPal's decision to do this.  Seriously what do they get out of it

There are some people like Cramer who depend entirely on the bubble for their careers. Cramer was a nobody for years after the 2000 crash and 2008. That's why he has to be manic excited about Goldman Sachs earnings. There is no "Investment Club" if there is no bubble.

TSLA is really goddamn quiet today. The ER runup happened up till Monday I guess. When I bought my 10/29 call. Not IV crush, more like bleed. Should I dump it before -50% or hold through ER or next week?
Why do I get the feeling this is all one big Ponzi scheme?
If PINS get bought, the valuation will be sky high. No idea why other social media names will sell off - this only increase their valuation

Why is Microsoft drilling? Should have taken my stop losses

Yeah, that‚Äôs the estrogen working.
VisualMod is fat I bet.
I'm surprised honestly they're not trying to go around insurance and sell it direct to wealthy boomers.  Thought about trying to set up a pay for play clinic myself in fact.

Regarding PINS: When one company acquires another, the stock prices of both entities tend to move in predictably opposite directions, at least over the short-term. In most cases, the target company's stock rises because the acquiring company pays a premium for the acquisition, in order to provide an incentive for the target company's shareholders to approve

It feels that way with SPY today the same assholes just handing each other the same 5k shares haha.
So would a lot of bag holders.
What's PYPL going to do with PINS? Probably make money. I don't know how, but they will figure it out. That's what these companies do while us poors sit here on our overpriced smartphones saying, 'Why they do that?'

At least $25 if charter is approved and the January 22 $30 calls are looking pretty nice
Ok but more seriously I am not sure. but have a boatload of 2023 20C I will start scaling out of at 25 and probably completely sell them at 30. I think it‚Äôll be easy to tick up until bank charter news.

I would be happy if we made WISH a successful meme stock. that is all
People keep shorting $WISH thinking it's September and every pop will sell-off instantly. More and more people are adding now and will have to cover eventually. Could get ugly for them.

You know Einhorn's young analysts are watching WSB very astute market moves as well as the commentary on his bad hair piece and the fact that he is an angry gay bear and he doesn't really understand the market after all

I actually read it wrong. If they're OTM Robinhood will do nothing, and let them expire worthless. If they're ITM and you don't have the cash to exercise, RH (may, but probably will) sell them about an hour before market close...at lower and lower bids in attempt to liquidate them for you.

$PINS buyout news is bullish for $WISH actually. Amazon offered to buy $WISH at $10B in 2015. That was 6 years ago when tech companies were worth shit compared to now and 10B valuation is $14 a share. If someone bought $WISH out today it would be for $30+

thinking that taking recreational drugs will fix you is something a stupid pussy would say, not that I am against the use of them for strictly fun
Just loaded up on 450 0dte puts. Let‚Äôs see how that goes‚Ä¶.
SPYs up 5% past week and volume keeps getting lower everyday.
8% so you're 1% shy of their minimum target.mac is usually 14%
Once CNBC starts reporting on $WISH it's going over $10 easily. That's how GME and AMC exploded with all media attention
4% is a lot though?
Hey mm bitches Idgaf!! Fy!!!
Fuck the volume on BABA has me a wee bit nervous
I have one day trade left, I've got ETSY 10/29 options up 80% and the gain on those covers \~60% of the cost of SPY options but they expire 10/25... Deciding what to do is going to be difficult. We're due for a pullback for SPY which has had me leaning towards exiting those today but I did not expect ETSY to skyrocket either
Hoping (expecting) a 10x from here in under a year. A low 4 figure bet to see a decent 5 figure gain.

I hear AAPL is considering a stoner/cannabis emoji, BULLISH!!!
it took like 5 months for it to do anything after the acquisition. it was dogshit for a while. You could have bought like Apple and got the same return. better yet. you coulda bought MSFT and made way more money.
Stocks, crypto, houses, cars, and inflation. All at ATH.

Remember when all the dweebs made fun of CRM for buying WORK and now they are dumping PYPL for the PINS talk. CRM is up something like 40% since the acquisition. PYPL going to do the same, hopefully it dumps enough to get a good price.
If AMZN, GOOG and the rest of big tech go green, that should be enough for ATHs on SPY.

Bought a bunch more when it dipped under 130. Couldn't figure out why the price dropped like it did in the last few months. Maybe people don't like the new CEO? Was surprised to see the percentage of it being short sold. I've owned the stock for a while and it always goes up. I'll sell the shares I bought at $130 when it hits $170. All the financials of the company still look great.

your sir, are very incorrect. Quality no. Good batteries? Yes. That‚Äôs about it. When talking about quality of the car I like to take into factor, the interior, body, &amp; overall ride. Tesla‚Äôs are sick, but luxurious or high quality would be a straight up lie.

Market can‚Äôt decide if this is good or bad for PayPal.
Paypal might buy
That can all be true and still it can be undervalued. Shopify‚Äôs market cap is 45 times WISH‚Äôs, yet just double quarterly earnings.

WISH ipo‚Äôd to $38, if earnings coming up soon show even a slight reversal (especially with ad revenue coming back in on the app) I think WISH can return to at least $7.50. That‚Äôs a pretty solid gain this week. $12 is not out of the realm of possibility if numbers are good. Again, still dramatically below their IPO.

Wouldn‚Äôt hold forever but money can absolutely be made.

SPY 500 by December 2021
Hmmm I think with the success of shang chi being direct to theaters only instead of that premium+ bullshit shows that it's not increasing their streaming numbers enough to justify it. Especially since they're doing that with all marvel movies moving forward again. 
I also think that the parks are getting ridiculously expensive while the quality is going downhill fast. Been to  Disneyland twice within the last 3 years and it's noticeably dropped in quality. From the worker morale to the food it's just not what it used to be. Meanwhile universal has increased in quality in both worker and foods. 
Idk that's my bear case. I think the increase in price and drop in quality of the parks will catch up with them especially while competition is improving. And I think that star wars and marvel won't be able to keep their streaming numbers growing for long.

They got info like what‚Äôs happening with bond yields, gourd sales in China, EV battery metal asteroid mining, AI analysis of the way JPOW walked to his car this morning, etc. a lot of obscure stuff we don‚Äôt have easy access to.
the fuck happened with PINS
The stock market knows 2 directions ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüìàüìâüìà
AXSM trending sideways the past several days up less  than half a buck today to $40.50 after last weeks power surge off the $32 level.

Investors still eagerly awaiting FDA approval for AXS 05, the crown jewel, multi billion dollar blockbuster drug the company began listing for account managers last week and then just yesterday increased their credit line in anticipation of marketing and rolling out the drug.

Analysts have targets as high as north of $150 making AXSM one of (one of) the best, most rare monster opportunities we will ever find.

Reminder, do not buy options in this one due to the extreme high premiums and the fact that there is just no need. Buying a $40 stock that is poised to go to $140 at any time makes it far better than an option because it doesn't expire and you can get it for $20 a share cash with margin. That's like having a stock that's an option, but again, better because it doesn't expire and you don't pay the premium.

One suggestion, buy double and sell calls on half so you get paid to wait. That's what I've done and have made thousands on a 40% add on to my core position.

Good luck

Well, back to watching these bars go up and down
Anyone Bearish on DIS? I hear don't fuck with the üêÅ tossed around. But they aren't getting good streaming numbers, their parks are super expensive at a time when people are getting cheap, and their their PE is over 200. I think their PE got where it is because of streaming and a new Star Wars isn't going to save them. The streaming bubble is going to pop imo, too many players not adding anything special.

Take your profits bro. Even if spy goes up a little more, you should take 150% when you can

Before I sharted
You get into an accident and fall into a coma. You wake up from the coma in January 2024. You ask "Doctor, please tell me, what is $SPY sitting at today?".    

The doctor checks. "$784."   

"Okay wow, great. And what about $TSLA?"   

"Let me see... opened this morning at $2071 per share."   

"Fantastic. And one more doc, please. What about $PLTR?"     

"Oh yeah, that one's been really volatile for the last year or so. Let's see... its at $24.99"
Yea but the dump is in the past

All eyes on Tesla
December 31, 2021 SPY call contracts are only $17 apiece. It's certainly tempting to buy a handful
Telling the world that the company will accept corn as payment, pumping it's price, selling your personal holdings, then saying lol jk (representing the company) is really manipulation.  He needs to remember he's speaking on behalf of the publicly traded company and can't use it for his own pump and dumps
I think you might be good.
Come on mouse
Yes, a stock being oversold is part of a being bullish
Only 10% more to reach 100% YoY. Lets gooo!
When you say calls do you mean more than one?
Those are great profits, I‚Äôm finally starting to learn that myself....reinvest a little on a dip maybe
$458
If I‚Äôm about to ask if I should sell, I sell.
&gt; *i'm rich, i don't need facebook*
Gotta love how BABA refused to fill the gap yesterday and just kept going up, only to fill today's gap in an hour. Stocks are tarded
Damnnnn 

SDIG making money moves
I feel like dumps every now and then are healthy for SPY to keep launching
You need to sell any buy weeklies
Please lort
Shoutout Robinhood for once again fucking me over and not allocating me ipo shares of SDIG
Yeah who knows when it will happen, but people were well hedged into that last 5-6% mini dip, seems we are more likely to get a nicer dip soon.
I like that you are saying "for the first time" which implies that:

1- you'll lose enough money to not be a millionaire and

2- you'll make it back over 1 mil.

LVS calls for earnings? Vegas has been more packed than ever
I would sell it, by 11/19 we will have a pullback you don‚Äôt want to be fucked by theta and a pullback at the same time.

Dems and TSLA earnings sending SPY to space tomorrow
Guys, we are still in OctoBEAR
1. Not baba
2. China
3. Pumping and dumping is illegal. Are you agreeing that you are pumping and dumping this stock?
I‚Äôm the king of holding options too long and losing gains or selling to early and missing out on massive moves :(
[deleted]
This is a bad comparison because those companies can reinvest in growth, leading to more value per share.

Sure the supply of "corn" is slowing but I can't get anything with it unless I unload it on someone else first, who then must do the same.
Can I get a TSLA chick?
Celina Powell is the streets
Is this where we find the answer to Kezzup's riddle?
Welp, bought SPY calls at the top because am retard.
I feel like this entire run is dependent on TSLA earnings.  We either keep mooning or reality hits.
Easy to be bullish when youre at rock bottom
Financials only make up a little over 13%, what gives you this hypothesis?
Fam I need a quick reality check. Is it dump to not sell a SPY call that‚Äôs up over 150%?  It doesn‚Äôt expire until 11/19

PLTR just waiting until lunch to join the Green Party right?
5% profit better then -95%. Better sell.
I have 65 10/29 310Cs I bought today at the first dip. Figured it was safe. Now I'm way underwater getting clapped.  Luckily my 0dte spy play offset some of this
I literally just bought at 5.04 lol. I have no bags. Just buy an hold for another pump that will inevitably come again. 

Too much money out there for investors not to gamble on these small caps

Duh bitch. Buy and sell. My average now is like $5.40 a share and I‚Äôve gotten in and out like 4 times before that. Buy shit at its floor instead of when it‚Äôs already at all year high silly goose.
Oh haha ya that‚Äôs exactly why
Calls before the earnings report?

ya i'll post them up next to the pictures of ur mum

I think you answered your question
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/exclusion111 (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 455.0 when it was 449.44 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Alright guys. I‚Äôve held a few dozen shares of GameStop since February. I thought about buying a few more but instead I just decided to sell. 

I‚Äôm taking requests for the stocks I should trade.
This is a terrible logic.

Hopefully the post something worthwhile for the earnings or we are headed back to the teens
Strike expiry?
Lmfao. Short it then pussy
SI has nothing to do with its current movement. You're still a poo brain
My instincts said SPY weekly calls so I bought SPY puts
Honestly kind of surprised. I just wanted to the banbet feature..
Does amzn ever go up? Or is it only when I'm not holding calls?
Which is why the price going up was inevitable
So...the market is priced for perfection, everything is fantastic!
Easy spy gains this am for 15% on 436 calls. 140k in again to come out with 20k. Also bought 460c that are nearing 100% but just baby 10k amount. 


Bought put spreads on TSLA after selling calls off yesterday for 60k profit. Put spreads are up 15% already. Would‚Äôve bought more but couldn‚Äôt get fills yesterday. 


Bought GOCO as well. It‚Äôs like a profitable CLOV and a not yet recovered SLQT which made me 300%. 


Bought some earnings plays shares as well too but just random chunks nothing worth reporting.
When i see wish talked about alot, and i see it go up 16 percent in one day with no new news, i know it's a pumpndump.
Come on Mr. Vix!
Swap car for van. You are now totally acceptable in the van life movement and have become am Instagram influencer. Congrats!

**Reason why $SPY will always go up**

Main requirement to join the S&amp;P 500:

&gt;last reported quarter must be profitable ‚úÖ

&gt;aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ‚úÖ

Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in todays economy.

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 10-20 unprofitable loser companies get delisted from S&amp;P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy constantly and always follows profits.

Same shit applied to snap and they figured it out . So can wish. 

Last I checked it‚Äôs still an INSANELY popular app , with 2.2m users rating. Millennials and younger generation are the target similar to snap.

It‚Äôs a trash app just like Snapchat (which is why it‚Äôs blood red and near 52 week looks) but idgaf, it‚Äôs still popular and that in itself has value these days.
It is just me or are memes kind of starting to spike? Mvis up 10% after getting murdered lately

Haha yeah then you'd be a very happy person
Wow. Someone finally won something on WISH
i hear some guy found a duffle bag with a million in cash behind the wendy's dumpster
This market is aids
Yep! This is the move! I'm retiring from WSB. It's been a wild ride holy shit!
Snap, Jumia, GME and AMC had/has way bigger issues than WISH recently and look at where they are now (they all increased several thousand %). Wish has a lot of resources and competent leadership to turn the situation around.   
Wish also has quite a strong balance sheet, and is virtually debt free with marketable securities, cash, and cash equivalents of approximately $1.6 billion. In addition, compared to the cash balance, the cash burn rate is not alarming, unless the company keeps showing similar poor performance in the next few quarters. I believe Wish is oversold and undervalued.
I think the Bronco Sport name confuses everyone, and half of them will think that's what you're talking about.

Actually, maybe you are...
&gt; I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about
Lmao absolutely nothing textbook or cup and handle about it.

COIN selling pickaxes and Jeans to the digital gold prospectors
Small caps are pushing right up against the breakout point (look at IWM) after moving sideways for 9 months.

If IWM breaks past 230-235 next couple of weeks, we should see a big move up to 250+.

I think small caps can easily carry markets another 10% from here if that's the case, so SPY 500 is pretty reasonable in next couple months even if big caps need to consolidate.
WISH didn‚Äôt sell off after $6, holding strong. $7 today???
Always a cup for da kettle fam.
I thought it was like 3000%? What happened to that?
first time. He's about to bug out
Now
When y'all get excited about my bags spiking 10% in two days, but they were already down 50%...
Yea that was before snapchat had multimedia and Ads on everything. They hadn't monetized the platform like they have today. Unless WISH has rabbits in their ass, I'm not sure what they could pull out of it to surprise the market.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)Question: since Sanofi $SNY is buying Kadmon $KDMN for $9.50 a share, and the board is meeting on 5 Nov to approve the offer, and it‚Äôs trading almost a dollar below the acquisition price, why wouldn‚Äôt people park cash here for an easy 11% over a couple of weeks?![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)

#imagin draggin deez nutz across your chin
I just imagined this.. wow
Imagine how high SPY goes tomorrow when TSLA hits 1000
We gonna sell Tesla calls before close?
Semis not doing too hot.
Probably when you're up 100% on premiums. That'd be my guess
well yeah, the options are down like 50pct though. should have just gone 100pct shares
Sell and buy CLOV
Imagine dragons
with current inflation you are basically a poor.
Remember when this sub said to short the fuck out of Snapchat and load up puts‚Ä¶..at $5???

Fucking inverse the clown ass bears on any ticker that‚Äôs been ran red hot with negative news. Same shit is happening with $WISH. 

Imagine thinking there‚Äôs actually a shit load more downside at $5 for that company lmao. All the negatives are known retards. Who the fuck is selling at that point?
MVIS is absolutely launching today
BB. Goes.  Choo. Choo.
&gt; I'm not sure. I'll have to check my calendar and see what's going on tomorrow.

Hopefully on the rescue for all the Tilray bagholders.
question- first time trading SPY 0DTE calls...when do i sell? is there a time of day thats best? they are OTM and up 100% on premiums at the moment

It was incredibly bearish in here last week and the talk was predominately on puts and collapses. It‚Äôs completely flipped in part because the bears have gone extinct

Ford really helping today
How do you think SPY will react to beige book today?
Welp I think I'm taking my 313% spy returns and walking, GL everyone who is sticking with it today.
AMEN, CASINO
If it goes over 50% green on an option I set a stop order to lock that in, then if it passes 100% move the stop up to that. My strategy at least. Minor adjustments depending on movement. 
If shares well hopefully you had a $ amount in mind at the start, but same concept set a stop.

My SPCE puts are not doing great. A company that pretends to launch people into space that's currently grounded until an FAA investigation is complete. A quick Google says these investigations take 2-3 years to complete. But yeah, I bought puts at the bottom because I'm an idiot.

I think they have become extinct. They were prevalent in the before time. We don‚Äôt speak of their reign of terror any longer.

today's the day to enter. I bought one
Went up 150% to down 40% and now I have returned back to where I started the year at. That seems like a win to me.
No dumbass. They offer data science and logistics all over the world. Let‚Äôs chat when you get a compsci or an electrical engineering degree.
Well either you bought puts on something consistently climbing for a month straight that is still pretty hyped or you bought calls after a huge run. So... my point stands about who the illogical party is, and it isn‚Äôt the company.

Edit: comment history it appears you have a fomo problem.
That's what happens when you lack conviction.

Well my pita got wiped out, trying for Friday. Good times.
Need to rename SPY to HULK
there is an idea of a bear, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real bear, only an entity, something illusory, and though it can hide its cold gaze and you can shake its hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: it simply is not there

Since last quarters reporting, there have been two major pieces of news. The first being a partnership with Manchester United in the last 2 weeks, the financial details were not disclosed. I have a feeling they are saving this tidbit for this earnings report. Second, they finished an acquisition of Clarabridge for $1.1 billion in common shares at a share price of $37.33. They actually finished this acquisition a quarter earlier than anticipated.

Now that this acquisition is finished, the contributions of this acquisition will start showing up in their financials this quarter. Alongside increased partnerships it should provide another surprise earnings beat and I won't be surprised if they have a positive EPS for the 3rd quarter in a row. On top of that, I believe they will confirm that they will hit $1 billion in revenue this year, a big psychological number.

They're also on a hiring spree, trying to hire thousands of workers in Europe as their international traction gains from their prior parent company $SAP. You don't really hire thousands of workers unless your projecting consistently strong growth in the year ahead.

What really caught my eye yesterday was the fact that someone bought 4,500 contracts on both $45 &amp; $50 11/19 call contracts yesterday before earnings. Once I saw that, I took a look at their technical setup and if you peak at the daily charts, you'll see a nice cup &amp; handle pattern forming.

TL;DR

* 4,500 contracts opened on both $45 / $50 11/19 calls

* i believe this will be the 3rd quarter of positive EPS and likely $1 billion in revenue will be achieved

* Manchester United partnership &amp; Clarabridge acquisition completion is big
Good if you bought the options and delta is increasing, bad if you wrote them and delta is increasing

Alright I think this is the play. Ride SPY until it hits ATH. Then immediately buy puts that are about 1% drop.
I sold too. No fuckin worries though we gotta pay ourselves.
Ride the wave this week. Puts on Friday for a red opening Monday. Then switch back to calls on memes.

Recommend buying the Perion Network dip, it‚Äôs an ideal time to hop on before next leg up. Triple bottom recovery right before what will be another huge quarter (as bullish as it gets). Just over being worth 1x revenues, very profitable, no debt, $100M+ cash in back pocket, grew over 80% YoY in Q2, very diverse and innovative (I work in the industry), and their peers are trading at 4-8x the valuation for similar performance. $PERI is ad tech‚Äôs best multibagger ROI potential in my opinoon, and my highest conviction position.

Times like this I like to look for non meme large cap stuff that for some extraneous reason is taking a hit, bad news / pr, wait for a classing ER beat and dump, etc - or like my mans below said, just wait it out. I can't pretend to be able to play with puts, I always lose, so I just wait for red and play the rebound

Leave it to the wish calls I grabbed yesterday to be what has me near breaking even today. Well glad I believed in the meme run potential rather than cared about my actual feelings toward the company. Time to set a stop then leave em be.

TSM can't hold gains. DIS trading at the bottom of the channel. CLF has high ping or something. Uranium is mooning. SPY is being indecisive and VIX is looking to drug it into an alley and have a little bit of fun. What a market.

Thoughts on coinbase puts?
Does INVZ have any catalyst to double by eoy??? I'd take that, $5 to $10.

Only a matter of time before BB makes its break
This is why I don‚Äôt even consider trading ‚Äòtil after 10am. Everything‚Äôs dropping right now, calls are cheaper than my wife‚Äôs onlyfans subscription right now.

So you obviously lost money like an idiot during the meme boom. 
Thanks for donating to my $300k gain off of meme stocks ! Those bags must be heavy.
Bruh AFRM green every single god damn day till I get calls. Like why
1 million percent sell before earnings.  You‚Äôre ITM.  Take at least cost basis.
Come on bb, fight back‚Ä¶.

Don‚Äôt cluck the Duck ü¶Ü
$TSLA calls with 1M or further expiries already got their IV crushed, yesterday was the year low, so very low chance of a post-ER IV crush being significant in that case.

However, $TSLA calls with 3 weeks or less still risk losing between 3 and 10 IV points.

If you want to hold through earnings, switch to longer maturities and go sufficiently ITM, because FDs will get destroyed. You can compute the expected impact of an IV crush vs the underlying move using online option pricers. Also to those holding stocks, selling covered calls isn't worth it, the IV is extremely low.

This isn't $NFLX which had a crazy IV run.

EDIT: slight correction, for the 1M+, it is Friday that was the year low in terms of call IV, but yesterday's IV was only 1 point higher.
Seeing absolutely zero chatter about COIN in WSB subreddit... Bullish.
Can‚Äôt believe some people missing this COIN run.
Buying 15 and 16c for next week

Lol sold Netflix at the bottom put was still worth half.
yeah, but you will still own the shares at a lower price than you bought them. I don't like CCs unless I've held shares for so long they would be way up before i employed the covered call strategy.

What? I‚Äôm just saying you‚Äôre using the term incorrectly. It refers to multiples. Like a 1 bagger means you doubled your investment and a 10 bagger means you‚Äôve made ten times your investment. You keep using it to refer to the amount you‚Äôre going to make. 

I‚Äôm not saying you won‚Äôt make 16k or whatever, I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre misusing the term. Making a ‚Äú16k bagger‚Äù would be turning $100 in to $1,600,000

You make maximum profit even if it goes up 100% +(assuming you‚Äôre selling puts or covered calls)
Looks like another boring spy melt up day
Thank you COIN and üåΩ for enabling my early retirement !

opened a SPY short at 449.8, down a little on it but sticking to my RSI strategy and not covering it while the odds favor me.  my NFLX short made up for the loss I had there this week.

Closed all my AAPL calls and solo SPY call. Shit looks flat and i had shit entries on the AAPL play. Spy got mw 40%. I‚Äôll take that and wait for something new.
Inflation is running hot at 5.4%.

The unemployment rate less ‚Äúquitters‚Äù is 1.9%.

QE is still running full throttle at $120 billion a month.

The Fed will not even think about raising interest rates until QE ends.  

If you do not think inflation can be persistent, think again.
I'm just shocked VIX is so low.

Down 4 dollars

BB. Will continue its rocket today. Day is just getting started.
Also Q1 guidance is going to punch alot of smooth brain bulls in the balls unfortunately
I'm done playing any ticker but SPY. SPY is literally the only thing that has been reliable profit from either calls or puts. Typing this in case some WISH or CLOV degenerates find some sense. 

Look at SPY pre-market. Read finance news. See how the first few minutes shakes out. And then stake a put or call position a few dollars OTM and a week or more DTE. So much less stressful.

BB yesterday gonna be CRSR today
You paper handed cucks!
Come on BB
heavy bag huh
TSLA begins its dance. Where will it find support this time.
So is Tesla just goes down
If SPY were to continue a modest 0.25% growth per day til the end of the year is would be at 500!  Pretty much priced in at this point!  üöÄ
Lol I may actually WIN my ban bet on SKLZ
$WISH has strength cause it didn't mega dump like TLRY. $WISH is much easier to pump cause TLRY moves with an entire sector of 10 other wed stocks which is hard to move. Also Holiday season and it's -85% from IPO
They said not to bet against the mouse, so I bet with the mouse, and the mouse bit me.
Oh yeah I know. It's been a theta play since June.

Is the larger market not at all concerned with china's potential real estate collapse with sinic defaulting today, and evergrande likely to later this week? It certainly doesn't look priced in to any securities yet. And with fear of contagion so high it seems likely that it will spread to international markets. Why are the markets so slow to react to china's '08?
Don‚Äôt forget I gave you the idea. Spell my name right on the check you send me.

For one, women don't yolo. Women are more risk-sensitive than men (neuroticism at work), so they're typically more conservative with those kinds of situations.

They are typically better at managing asset distribution, rather than creating wealth through them.

But, that ironically is why they can make money in the market. They're focused on keeping their money more than risking it. But, that also mean they take longer to make money, because men take more risks that give huge rewards.

Bro I‚Äôm from Ohio
How many calls did you sell?
BB/CLF
NFLX going to 615
If I add my house value in then we are a little closer but you‚Äôre still doing better than me. I just added some of my principle to that total, not the total value. Removed liabilities meaning remaining balance. Owe around 400k on a 2.5% interest loan. No debts personal debts. Principle paid is around 100k give or take a few thousand more. So actual cash assets around $320,000

If I add my home equity since I bought I‚Äôm probably closer to $500,000
Which is flipped when supply chain isnt an issue. Adaptation costs a ton of time and money. You could be in the middle of changing your strategy just to find out supply chain got itself sorted already.

There was general under-investment in things like steel and oil, and I assume other commodities, over the past decade in favor of tech. I would say there was probably not enough training in those fields either so now we have a skilled manual labor shortage.
Except big businesses are hurting. They just have the cash to stay afloat. Six months ago I couldn't even get black drip coffee at Starbucks and half their menu was unavailable. Ford lost what, 30% revenue thanks to the chip shortage? You just dont see it because they have the cash flow to deal with shortages while small businesses goes under.

I dont think the government has the capacity to put in safety blankets for supply chain. Almost every business has a supply chain. How distribution of those resources is handled would literally be it's own supply chain. Personally I feel like it would be a colossal mess with billions wasted in dead money when supply chain isnt an issue.

Automation is the future. Some companies are already integrating automated services like Walmart and Amazon. Its extremely expensive though, so only those with a massively green bottom line can play around with it.

I can't understand how people find $BABA releasing new chips bullish. That will just give the US an excuse to finally sanction it. They'll simply say they're concerned the CCP and the Chinese military might be using those chips. For me it's bullish short-term because it shows $BABA as a tech badass with all the recent headlines, but long-term it still remains a ticking time bomb.

i certainly don't have an answer, but the reason i don't see it as being an issue that the businesses necessarily need to adapt to since all the big corporations aren't really hurting as far as i can tell.

i'm not saying anything about obsolescence, the main problem is transportation and manufacturing. and like you said since lean and JIT is the ideal for businesses, this problem was inevitable even without the pandemic. and also like you say, companies don't want to move away from that since they will just be cornering themselves out. i feel like it is on the government to look into methods of expanding infrastructure and thus supply chain capacity to avoid these kinds of bottlenecks.

the only thing i could think of for companies to do that might be in their benefit would be increased automation in transportation and warehousing but i also know literally nothing about any of that and haven't studied enough about this sort of stuff so i'm just rambling basically

Could be a good play if you can lease the space for a decent price and have a solid foundation laid out for your distribution network. Problem is you'll have to expand your logistics to include that warehouse. If logistics becomes a bottleneck (which it has) you could end up back at square one except with an additonal leased space. In the end it comes down to what kind of product you have, style of production, and style of distribution.

I‚Äôll second this, based on my own experience. With that said, going back to the OPs comment about being bullish on storage space, it should be, in theory a good play.

Flooded with artistic types who want to be practical and earn a dime with benefits (not a bad idea!) while still being artistic. Stay away. Competition is stiff.

If you were hiring, I'd suspect you'd do better getting a $15/hour person rather than paying salary and benefits. Unless you're like Pepsi or Tesla or some major company.
It‚Äôs a shit job if it‚Äôs a job‚Ä¶ art (digital or not) is extremely profitable if you‚Äôre talented (and self employed) though.
But what could you do? If you move away from lean and JIT, your competitors make more money than you. Supply chain is way too integrated and unique to each individual business to make this a government problem. It's up to the business to adapt. When lean and JIT became the norm, this sort of situation was bound to happen.

I haven't heard about issues surrounding obsolescence Not refuting you, but where are you getting that info from? I thought the main problem was bottlenecks in transportation and manufacturing.

Exactly this. I work in manufacturing and the drive is always to hold as little inventory as possible because holding inventory costs money in terms of space and management. Companies are doing this to themselves and they aren‚Äôt going to turn around and start stock piling because of this. They‚Äôll just wait it out and complain that it‚Äôs their supplier‚Äôs fault all the way back up the chain.

Does anyone have insights into the "graphic designer" career path?

I'm an engineer and not artistic so I won't be joining the ranks or anything but it seems like the career where you are most likely to read about someone who was making $70k a year but got laid off and can only find work for $15/hour.

Is it just a shit career path flooded with people or is there something special you need to do to be recognized as an actual designer?  If I was on the hiring side would I get more work out of paying two kids $15/hour or out of paying some "expert" $70k?

It‚Äôs not the sort of play people here are looking for because you‚Äôre looking at years to see stocks like VZ/T significantly beat the market. And in that time some one could find a bunch of shorter term smaller moves and beat the VZ/T play. But the VZ/T 5G play is pretty secure as plays go, they aren‚Äôt going anywhere, and you get dividends at least while you wait, it‚Äôs actually IMO a great play for newer risk averse investors - which just isn‚Äôt this sub.

Supply chain guy here.

Too much emphasis on lean manufacturing and just in time delivery. No one wants to address supply chain because if people move away from these tactics costs go through the roof and cant come back down. Worse yet once supply chain does get sorted out the companies who stick with the current strategies have a huge leg up on their competitors. Supply chain is super rigid especially for large corporations. Companies are just praying things go back to normal somewhat soon.

So if you take your storage example, what happens to that space once supply chain gets its shit figured out? It becomes dead money that you may not be able to move. Costs to transport and hold goods is already sky high. Adding more costs for a temporary fix is difficult to pull off.

*NFLX $663 to $620 all in a few hours, the market in a nutshell. The stimmie checks are long gone, Chirona still killing hundreds of thousands, sub/ad based Google, Snap, Fartbook, Amazon are all fckd. JPow pump is over, should have been over 6 months ago, Wall St is a disconnected, blind repository of fake accumulated wealth, which makes the stealth cockroaches smile but never sees the light of day, locked up in some tax fraud, offshore bottom less pit. lol*

Did you know Platinum mining is only around 8 million ounces a year?  Surplus/Deficit avg 100-200k ounces a year.  Current prices are $1040 an ounce.   If only a few thousand investors started hoarding platinum it goes parabolic. Just fun food for thought on how fragile some commodities are.   Look what happened to Rhodium which is a by product of platinum mining.
It's fantastic. Highly recommend.

.. er .. there is a PIPELINE from Russia to Western Europe  
Russia also uses it to sell on Iranian gas to Western Europe

As well as the pipelines to the Baltic and Germany, Russia sellls liquid gas via  pipelines and LNG (Liquid Natural Gas) harbours to Sweden, Norway, and Finland, and those European states ship it to to the UK and sell it on for profit.

This enables the British government to swear it does not buy gas  from Russia.

but EVERYBODY knows thisin the UK it's a standing joke and has been for a WHILE .. the UK makes up its energy shortfall every winter from Russia (Russia and Iran) via the Baltic states.

&lt;And - note - also continually buys electrical energy via undersea cable directly from French nuclear power stations, while perverting "UK green energy" statistics for the voters&gt;

oh wow, I might be one, I was thinking abt buying calls prior to earnings
hold that retardation close to you it will serve you well
I agree they made the right call, good time to sell. I will, Thanks for the kind words. Hoping to find a farm before 2023.
Elon has repeatedly said that he won't take SpaceX public, though he may spin off StarLink and make that public

If putin was a real leader he would be able to provide basic care for his people but he fails as even that.  Putin is more and more the kim-jun-li of russia.  Offering nothing to nobody but bluffing all the time in effort to scare enemies into pity.  He cannot provide even the basics so he will be slowly consumed by the new cold war.

The Fed Beige Book is released at 2:00 p.m.
It'd have to average +1.6% per day over the next 8 trading days, for a compounded return of about 13% from now to the 29th.  
  
Not impossible, but also not certain given the FUD around BABA and China in general. Especially Evergrande default in the 23rd.

It‚Äôs not trust me. I‚Äôve done extensive research into starting a small weed business. For various reasons the profit margins and resulting overhead/taxes make the final product uncompetitive with the black market. It‚Äôs why even in legal states many people still use their old dealer. Simply put weed from across the border is cheaper for the consumer due to much lower cost of production and labor.

Something that still bugs me about the whole GME shitshow that I haven't seen anyone ask as yet. If they stopped people from buying GME and only allowed selling, who the fuck were people selling to if nobody was allowed to buy? I mean, I know the answer is that it allowed shorts to cover, but it's still something that should be brought up.

You guys are like my family, and this comment makes me feel like I'm home.
I couldn't comment for a hot minute. I thought Visualmod had banned me for embarrassing them with my banbet win. All is good. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
&gt; I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.

i just want my shitty flair for getting first post in the thread.  WTF am I going to do now to earn this shit???  im scared rn
Your current place doesn‚Äôt have heat???
The pronouncing of BABA is very close to ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù in Chinese.

So BABA is literally your daddy.
Cumpiss huzza?
my bro the only one out here asking the real questions.  Where's our tiny jack ma emoji with the cute tiny face?
I mean they are marijuana stocks, why wouldn't they be so much higher than they were yesterday?
That's 3 words. Fix up
Could just be security concerns. An MP just got murdered last week so they‚Äôll be on high alert, they may have received a threat on the Queen in NI
Was about to rent to own my dream house, literally everything my girlfriend and I needed to start businesses and they last minute decided to pull the rug out and sell it to someone. F in the chat boys it's gonna be a cold winter for me.
My 3/23 Aapl 160 calls are looking good
No justice, no peace
Royale with cheese üßÄ
Like Russian roulette with 2 in the cylinder
So I guess Gold is the move with Inflation fear rising.
Where the fuck is our Jack Ma WSB emoji?![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Can‚Äôt wait to see if it‚Äôs gonna be a pump or dump for meme stocks today
One word. Competitor
Trading on Euro time feels unnatural
Prepared to watch RIOT get slaughtered at open, only to turn around and rebound by end of day.

Would be nice if management would announce an update (or completion) of the shelf offering.  Sure would help the stack of OTM FDs that I have open.
Nat gas puts, tesla puts and netflix puts even better.
COIN will be the stock that takes my portfolio to $1million. In at $240 and not exiting until at least a 5x

This is why BABA is such a shining light in my portfolio. Nobody's worried about an event so far in the future.
Kick off meetings always boring. Especially if the guy running them is an idiot. Just sit in the back.

Oil puts and tesla puts combo = double tendies
Spy calls? New ath?

You dont think the death of the Queen Mother would move the market?

Edit: Your right but I like these news posts.
How is this affecting stonks
Look at BB.  Same exact graph.  Probably a hedge covering their shorts
wow I thought it would be cool to be here early but its just sad.  aint like it used to be thats for sure.  Thats fine though I'll still be repping the OG bullshit while everyone else is off with their hidden threads and their ogs and their wnks and their cumpiss huzzas that I've all been banned from for disturbing the peace lmaoooo
Like this hundred pages long "List of dates predicted for apocalyptic events"? This thing is hilarious.
Any idea what moved the marijuana stocks so much higher yesterday, I couldn't find any news that would explain the jump?
I turned $100 into $2k on online blackjack and slots. Then proceeded to lose it all making $50 bets on the slot machines. That was fun
or those cute tiny face pics
VisualMod loves the royals.
It doesn't default before Oct 23
&gt; I don't know.
Def putting a large chunk of change on CROX before close tonight.
Is that a good idea to become a daily trader on SAVA? It goes up and down for at least 10% every week.
China would moon so hard if Jack Ma posted feet pics.
How is this market news?

Lamest night of watching futures like a degen ever.
I have some cash lying around, TSLA 869 was an honest price. Unfortunately, no serious dips in sight, where is this Evergrande catastrophe I was promised? üò†

Just learned recently that I can trade on margin with my shitty broker.   
Can't believe I've been trading my chump change for the last year.  
Time to leverage sufficiently for my risk tolerance.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

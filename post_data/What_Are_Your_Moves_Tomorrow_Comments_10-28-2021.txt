The next Daily Discussion thread is [here](https://redd.it/qhjkuz)
The date is January 27, 2021. AAPL absolutely crushes earnings with a record 111bil revenue. The stock drops from $145 to $137. 

It doesn’t recover that $145 mark until 7 months later in mid July. 

This might indicate what’s going to happen tomorrow. Or it might indicate that we’re overdue for a nice pop.
Are you buying at open or nah

Why hasn't PYPL recovered yet?
The moment it reaches those levels I'm selling cause theta will horse fuck me tomorrow if I don't sell today, in my opinion.
I was so close to buying a 16c on Ford yesterday
Buy the fucking top! LOL

He’s right you know
I’m going to hold my TSLA calls.

Will probably cause it to fizzle out all day again and fail to reach 1100.
Mangos are very delicious when at the perfect ripeness.

Mango looking bigly tasty


Why’d I get out

Jk I banked on it but I should have kept some
Yeesh I didn’t know about that. Being in little New Zealand has its pitfalls
Of course not, it's going to break 1100 today or tomorrow.  Been flirting with it all week.  Last time it was in this range ore split, it ran to 1500 in a week
It unfortunately probably will be flat as everyone waits for the big boys to report AH
anyone know if Amazon is subject to the vaccine mandate for federal contractors?  Amazon works with Fed right?  So all their employees must be vaccinated or they get fired right?  Shouldn't that be bigger news or am I out of the loop on this?

Bought 3 or 4 months ago when premium was $1.86
&gt; I am.
Ford looked like a good play at open 👏🏻 but who else is going long with AMZN, already strapped in ready for QE to hit? 🚀
no need to reinvent the wheel with batteries, just buy whatever is best for you. Batteries are a low margin product, why would you want to make them in house?
#TESLAW
when u buy tho??
Huge 1070 wall though
Hopefully huge fucking green
look like all the dwactards are ready to be hurt again.  post lossporn for us
I hope you're right. Starting to think this one could actually go to $0, even though it's a good company

I unserstand to buy more tobacco!

Current aluminum technology fits his needs. The batteries that were available on the market when he was starting did not.

gonna need a strike and exp bro if u want some real advice
Guess we shouldn't be buying weed companies then either.
what you mean? if market stays green what hinders it from jumping from -6% to let's say -3% right at opening? you think it will tank more?![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)

Ford has a dividend. Ok. You’re telling me there’s no better internal investment use for the money? Retooling for EVs, R&amp;D, building a battery CELL plant— not just pack assembly plant? 

Everyone excited about a Ford dividend but what does this say about their management? 

If I owned Ford I’d want them seriously considering how to DIY batteries. Their “battery plant” is literally just packing Chinese batteries into a square for the f150. They are drinking from the same well as everyone else.

Basically be a degen and buy FDs with money you shouldn’t risk. All jokes aside, I saw the support building above 1030 and decided to scale in. It’s in a major uptrend having just broken above 900 and have set a new high of 1095 (which almost always gets retested) in an upward momentum. So I thought risk / reward was decent enough and at least I would’ve had two trading days to average or exit upon yesterday’s high retest at least

I doubled down on my position yesterday. My account is either going to skyrocket or crash and burn today.
giving out shitty jpegs with pre-order of the latest rehashed junk.  They're marketing directly to retards.  Stocks are now their biggest seller, they are a stock company that sells already opened video games on the side.  the market as we used to know it is no more.  It's all purely marketing (propaganda) and stock, this is the end game.

Never ever jump at peak. Don’t chase. Not even once.
Let me tell you why this one movie theater is undervalued
I use Robinhood for day trading/ swing trades and gambling, and TD for long term.
What you guys don't understand is that playing SPY 0DTE's has the best rate of return long term. It happens every few days, take for e.g. yesterday. Puts in the last 20minutes went up 400%. Just don't go all in, roll the dice multiple times and you will hit winners.
You talking about Amd? Cause that’s what happened today =(. I still got a couple hours after open for it to hit 130 xD
The only problem we have is J.Powell might gonna start taping next month so the stock market might pull back but other than that I believe semiconductor is really important now. AMD and NVIDIA gonna kick ass next year.

 But....don't might not be a good idea to take my advice lol.
I’m lighting a cheap knockoff candle in his honor
Of course yes. You know how much shit you gotta eat at work for 250k? Much more than one coil, I assure you

Tesla is still undervalued. I know a lot of you wont believe it but then again a lot of you dont read 10-Qs. Google is also undervalued. FB too but FB is trash.
Man, life and SPY was better back when SPY was at 320

I will perfect the art of remaking Chick-fil-A nuggets. We will rent a place right next to my current Chick-fil-A. We will sell only nuggets and select dipping sauces and of course ketchup. Namely on Sunday’s. 


If you would like to get in on early IPO please let me know now. 


If you know how to turn on stoves also please inquire within. We will become masters.

Their markup is insanely too high and they don’t have a copyright on fucking chicken nuggets so it’ll look and taste as close to the same as possible.

I thought to buy this V dip but then saw MA earnings are in 2 days. You know, i will sit this one out. In a normal market there would have been near 0 chance V drops again on MA earnings but right now we might see another sharp drop. Will be buying only when both V and MA settle. If they bouce back hard in a following days then be it.

Agree to all of 1st paragraph. And I am aware that the drop-out in 2013 was due to a suprise taper announcement. But my calls only need VIX to move *a bit* beyond expected, and VIX is both spiky and at the very bottom of its channel.  I'll exit 50%  on the single intraday move, then fade the rest in chunks.

JPow actually fully confirmed it on *Friday*. You can check the speech transcript. Market tried to move VIX up significantly, but chose denial till Wed.

The problem im trying to illuatrate here is the effect on ownership for company founders. Its imo only one problem with the bill. But the simplest way to explain it is basically, lets say you have an instrumental founder. Someone you cant replace with a career CEO. That founders shares have a cost basis of zero. So all gains in this tax scheme would become taxable after a billion dollars in gain. At that point they will have to borrow against 50% of their shares to pay the tax. Effectively "losing" control of voting rights for 50% of their ownership. If the spot price of the shares decline the lender might liqudiate the shares the founder pledged to control their risk. It gets crazier when a group can purchase a majority stake in a company at a higher coat basis and effectively keep control of the company longer simply due to a higher cost basis. They could skirt the unrealized gains tax but the founder couldnt.
Damn wtf

Well you’ve come to the right sub. In a nutshell, calls are a bet that a stock goes up to a certain price by a certain date. You can make a lot of money or lose a ton with these bets
Hitler was a world war 1 veteran that saw horrific violence with trench warefare. Ultimately Germany was defeated by politicians and not by the military. Left wing politicians in Germany was what most of the German army blamed for the defeat in world war 1. They then got a shit deal in the treaty. Everyone knew that treaty was dog shit and wasn't going to usher in long term peace. 

And on top of that, they didn't let him into art school. WW2 was inevitable.

Bears in control?
Europoors today
On September 27, 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt writes to German Chancellor Adolf Hitler regarding the threat of war in Europe. The German chancellor had been threatening to invade the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia and, in the letter, his second to Hitler in as many days, Roosevelt reiterated the need to find a peaceful resolution to the issue.

The previous day, FDR had written to Hitler with an appeal to negotiate with Czechoslovakia regarding Germany’s desire for the natural and industrial resources of the Sudetenland rather than resort to force. Hitler responded that Germany was entitled to the area because of the “shameful” way in which the Treaty of Versailles, which had ended World War I, had made Germany a “pariah” in the community of nations. The treaty had given the Sudetenland, a territory that was believed by Hitler and many of his supporters to be inherently German, to the state of Czechoslovakia. Therefore, Hitler reasoned, German invasion of the Sudetenland was justified, as annexation by Germany would simply mean returning the area to its cultural and historical roots. Hitler assured Roosevelt that he also desired to avoid another large-scale war in Europe.

I think the short interest is gone now though
&gt; No. Tesla is one of the most shorted stocks in history, so it's not likely to be suppressed under 1000 for much longer than a few days.
Market makers probably have a big interest in suppressing Tesla this week under 1000 because of open options right?

Everything is gapping up tomorrow, save this post. The fake dog internet money spike just now and then futures following after a pretty broad red day with a low vix is enough to convince me
The policy is means limited and only applies to people with $1 billion in wealth or $100 million in yearly income. It would affect a grand total of about 700 people. This would not apply to any company or any person, it is strictly a way of raising funds while ensuring that the stratospherically wealthy can't gain extraordinary excess advantage because of the depth of their wealth and control of the market.

The purpose of the policy is ultimately to create a downside to the mass accumulation of a stock if you're above a certain amount of money in wealth, because otherwise you can just accrue until you basically control the price, which is a problematic dynamic that currently affects the market significantly. It also opens the door to the current common practice of stacking the majority of an executive's compensation in stock, dodging short term taxes.

The other problem, as you noted, is that basically those with massive wealth leverage the spot price (which is not real) to constantly leverage and build up further... that amplifies the problem and basically kills the capital velocity of a market through wealth aggregation.

Will this result in a mass drawdown of stock ownership? Slowly, if any needs to be liquidated to pay the tax, but keep in mind that the cap gains tax change ultimately comes down to around 15% (or less since write-offs will apply and nobody at that level invests as an individual... they're all corporations) and as long as overall potential gains exceed, even with profit leakage, the tax, it's still worthwhile to stay invested.

Elon, for instance, would be dumb to sell without re-upping to cover his excess 15% burden, assuming it even got that high... his return is far, far greater than that per dollar invested.

Amazon operates in 13 countries with specific sites dedicated for shoppers in the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, and Spain.

While Wish is in 120 countries… there are so many people that don’t use Amazon or have Amazon or can’t afford Amazon prime in those countries. 

My point is that we have 7 billion people in this world, therefore there are still plenty of room to grow for Wish and can take that piece of e commerce pie.

Futures are real and hetero
The problem with taxing unrealized gains is that the spot price is a theoretical value. You cant sell 100B of Amazon at the spot price. The price would collapse. Essentially any founder of a company will lose 50% of the company the first year at the spot price to taxes. Then when the price tanks later they could be margin called for their remaining shares to cover the difference. Imagine how successful Tesla would be without Elon? Now imagine what innovation lies ahead that we havent thought of and erase them. Status quo forever. Basically any activist short could target any company they want for a take over. Pump the mark to market, force tax, dump the price and force a margin call. Then buy shares at a higher cost basis than the founder and have the ability to hold more control than the founder because the founders cost basis will always be close to zero.

Granted it’s not the Holocaust, but it’s a poorly designed, unfair law that people would hate if applied to themselves. Smart, fair ways of raising taxes are unpopular. Everyone wants to charge others and increase the benefits for themselves. This one allows the goose to be plucked with the least amount of short term hissing, because only a relatively small number of geese are affected. It creates perverse incentives in the long term though. Fortunately, it’s not Constitutional on the face of if it. Once it fails, it’ll hopefully allow for better taxes to be written.

Truth 👆
AFRM is live on Amazon today. AMZN announces earnings tomorrow. And what will be Amazon's focus on the call? Affirm's official rollout.

Why?

Amazon will convert MUCH higher numbers on products &gt; $50/item. For example, you can finance any items &gt; $1500 for over 48 months. And Amazon (merchants &amp; amazon) get paid in full. Amazon will blitz the news tomorrow, and the biggest winner here?  AFRM.

**AFRM $200 coming soon**

It's ok to buy stocks at or near ATH if you pay attention to the momentum. If it continuously trades above it's 50 and 200 day MA the momentum theory calls it a buy. Buy high, sell higher

But since you seem so in the know, look into asts
Fat people don't realize that other people use your health as a proxy for whether you have your shit together in your life. It's a snap judgment and it's not always valid but it's always done. Getting healthy is by far the best and most in a persons control they can do to increase their influence with people.  I got overweight in college and when I worked for a start up but that's because of booze and working 90 hour weeks. Getting healthy changes everything. Get healthy and stay that way for a while and you'll adjust socially.

Thats, actually a really solid point looking back at being a fat kid in hs and college. It made me more insecure, i was mad fun of and haven't really ever dated in my life. All because i was fat. I've managed to change because of the hate but there are still aspects I've yet to feel comfortable about in terms of dating and interacting with people
only fat tits allowed
I don’t think people desire to be fat as much as they don’t want to put in the effort or discomfort not to be fat. It is body shaming, but shame is a useful tool. If you want to be fat, you have to accept the consequences of other people finding you unappealing to look at and to be generally disgusted by you. Conform or endure, but don’t try to make people feel guilty for your indulgences.
Now a skinny retard

Shaming fat shamers has been one of the worst things to happen to western culture. Fat people should be pressured into being healthy. Getting fat is just as bad as being a smoker. It does terrible shit to your body.

Reading it, seems to me that it primarily impacts long term option gains that offset profits from an owned underlying and other schemes to capture gains. Pretty sure most people on here are just trading calls or puts without an underlying that they're looking for advantaged tax status on... in fact, I think it's likely that a good chunk of people here have never played an option that attained a delta &gt; 0.7 LOL
They get conned into buying a pumpers fortune

All big girls don’t suck dick. Their profiles on tinder and bumble all say no hookups. Please, you’d be so lucky
This can apply to many things in health too . But im sure she has seen people just spend thousands just because of poor lifestyle decisions.

+219% (+$1268) on the 1425

Overall doing very well on TSLA… ~95% shares, ~3.5% calls
When did it become acceptable to be fat ? Fat shaming needs to be more prevalent in todays society. Calls on bullying!
Ugh. Reminds me of this drunk bitch that sat down at the last seat, gets dealt a 17, despite all the pleading she hit it, taking the dealers bust card.

Everytime I go through TSA it becomes more clear the terrorists won. What a brilliant plan they executed. They attacked on home soil,  got us to spend trillions of dollars, and we lost a bit of American culture that was more laissez faire.
Yeah so it can move anyway
Let me tell y’all about one of life’s greatest hacks, it’s called the triple L

Live Laugh Love
Okay here it is my last time pumping $COIN.  My next move will be loss porn or gain porn.  Coinbase is selling Americans all of the code currency.  When there is a massive move in dog token, popular coin, or Russian thing Coinbase is profiting.  Their EPS is 13.5, this is a massively profitable company. 

They are not just an exchange, but also hodlers.  Do you think they can spot the dip?  And do you think they'll know when to unload?

China.  Run away.  If it goes public in the US, it'll be back by a shell company in the cayman islands so in reality, you will own stock in a PO box like all the other Chinese listed stocks. Nothing is legit in China.
Fuck me it's late. Goodnight degenerates. I hope you're all rich in the morning.
Hello fellow $WE-tards. Looking forward to my puts continuing to print tomorrow.
It seems to me a lot of people bought $F puts. Who sold them??
You technically cannot trade Chinese stocks in the US. What you’re trading is claims to shares by someone who can trade Chinese stocks
I like Interactive Brokers' british butler sounding voice prompts (ie 'market data lost, market data reestablished') -- makes me feel rich AF.

Friday tesla gapped from 830 to 905.

Then monday 905 to 1014.

Then on Tuesday 1014 to 1095.

So there is 200 dollars change in two dayz.

So tomorrow 1060 t0 1150 then 1150 to 1300
You mean that Lexus that they keep riding into the curb in their parking lot?
I hope not. If it goes up to 1500 I should just have hold on.

Isn’t the jump with that always the day after Cyber Monday?
I don’t think it will totally be like 2013. At that time the entire market was caught off guard by tapering and no one was expecting it. I think the fed chair at the time casually mentioned to congress that they were about to start tapering soon and the market went ballistic when they heard. We’ve been told since the beginning of the year that it’ll happen towards the end of this year and last month jpow pretty much said it was gonna be this month. 

So imo, there won’t be a panic but that doesn’t change the fundamentals which are that less money will be injected into the markets. That is going to take its effect even if we are all prepared for it
I'm fairly new to this. So I never saw a split happening. Is it better to buy after the split, or own stocks while they are splitting?

Also I tried to research when $TSLA will split next time and couldn't find any relevant information, do you have any sources on that?

I…I don’t remember signing up for this TED talk
Thoughts on Nio? Anyone actually reinvesting TSLA gains?
TA says the run ain’t over yet.
Well fuck you then maybe I buy puts

Tim Apple going to report earnings with his Foghorn Leghorn KFC accent and then $AAPL gonna drop like its hot.  My guess is $145 and downward back to $135-$138 in the coming days before it goes back up.
I've gotten pretty long hugs from random women I just met and I have like... \*counts mentally and adds up on my fingers* 1 or 2 female friends I could probably hug for as long as I want without too much issue

Buying more $SOFI
All these people in here making money on earnings plays and you're still focused on a company that doesnt make any money... smh
Do your research. Tapering is for all intents and purposes reducing stock prices in the short term to help the economy against inflation in the long term. By definition tapering is taking money out of the bond market, which indirectly leads to a shift in money from the equity market into the bond market
Nothing better than good champagne and good Cabernet Sauvignon

Wine drunks are technically the best while ur in them, very level. Gin makes me angry or pugnacious, beer makes me puke or text exes or talk shit to people bigger than me. Tequila and vodka, I usually do something or sleep with someone I regret for the rest of my life. But wine... Wine is amazing. I take baths, and read novels, and watch Netflix dramas or call my mom and talk about family happenings. The hangovers all suck equally, although different.
I dont like either but Rogan by a mile. Dane Cook was just a whiny pussy. Feels like the type of guy who would talk shit then call the cops the second someone took a swing
Damn, you’re boss now :)

you kinda gotta develop a cadence to it and use consistent risk profile and appetitive. earnings are my favorite because when you sell puts you get some nice ass high IV that gets crushed where even if it goes the wrong way against you, you aren’t that fucked. for example selling the FB 310 right before earnings

M swift, K bella, F ariana. I don't really know who bella is so kill.
&gt; Upside: It's more volatile and has a higher beta. Downside: You have to pay for the shares if you want them, but it can be worth it over time
Asts
I would go balls deep in it.
What are some benefits and downsides to a High Float stock?
Fun Fact: If you keep a straw in your butt you'll never fart.
Im no bear. Fuck your puts bro
Bella Thorne is probably the kill, just logically, I would marry Ariana because she’s the hotness right now, and I would fuck Taylor swift to have one over on Kanye.
It's ACTUALLY retarded in here at this time of  night.
In what universe is that call cheap???
ima put you fucks on. if you need a break from losing money, do yourself a favor and make some homemade Caesar dressing. serious eats is my recipe of choice. just get an immersion blender and a few ingredients and you’re good to go. It will change your life
You’re the one who came up with it lol
What you need to do is collect enough money to buy a house (don't worry, everyone does this to get margin), then take out either a home equity loan or a HELOC which is essentially just free money (everyone does this too). Then you just take the money you're getting from the loan and buy your options. Risk free money and risk free leverage, trust me
majority of s&amp;p 500 gains are made overnight, b/c earnings are posted when markets are closed if your not holding overnight your literally missing out on a shit load of gains
I want Fat Dicks in my flair and not the abbreviation.
I did SPY 500 then 1000 then 2000. If I'm here next week I'll double or nothing again.
Yeah but all Month ain’t this week. This week is time to ride out the calls you already had

Is Australia bond going to affect us tomorrow?
Hey! Cool beans. What margin return do you normally shoot for. Like a 1-2% or a higher volatility stock for higher returns?

Maybe but different mix. SOFI is mainly student loans, LC mostly super high coupon credit card replacement personal loans

Bullish or bearish for the next hour
If you’re below 2100 you should always just keep playing, people these days learn really sharp opening prep and try to force errors and use unusual lines, and their endgame suffers.

I bought an AMD processor for my supercomputer recently (128 4 GHz cores) because the specs were better than what Intel could offer at the price. AMD does make better processors. I don't have a position in either company but I'd long AMC before Intel.
Yep. We shake off today and get ready for green candles through the weekend

Baby stonk account.  I was running at a realized loss all year, and then utterly screwed that up this week.  To make it worse, my stonk account would be up another 9% if I sold today rather than a few days ago, and if my CC didn't get assigned on F last week by 11c.  F DOESNT JUMP.  NOW IT DID.

visa is different it's overvalued running at a P/S ratio of over 20 same as MA not saying they are bad companies but just overvalued at the current price point. Whereas Amazon is only trading at P/S ratio of 3.8. Look at Snapchat it has been running at a P/S ratio of over 30 the last year and look what happened to it dropped straight off a cliff. I suspect Tesla will do the same if it hits near 1500 a share.

Intel makes cheaper products than AMD that are better while being cheaper. I get why AMD has been doing so well, but until it can actually make *better* cpus than Intel, or better gpus than Nvidia, or better data center products than either, then this was just a good run powered by a semi shortage, crypto mining frankly, Intel flubs, and hype.

🇺🇸 🇨🇳 Phase 2 Trade Deal getting closer and talks going great....DWAC is leading the negotiations 👍
Yeah when they announced their new CEO I thought that maybe he would turn the ship around and actually release a new product or something, but Intel hasn't gotten better so now I'm starting to think it doesn't matter who is in charge over there. It's like they hit a wall and can't develop anything better than their limit.
Worked at a pretty rough manufacturing plant last year with some old school dudes that have been there 30 years plus.  HR made all of us take an online course for sexual harassment (zero women in building), it also included a half hour section on correct pronoun usage.

For the next month I witnessed the burliest dudes calling each other "Zir" and "Zi" in the wrong context and shit it was absolutely hilarious.

Intel for the last 3 years: Flat

AMD for the last 3 years: 5x investors' money

Who can say where the money goes

Where the options flow, only time

And who can say if your gains grow

As the market rose, only time
My disappointment is immeasurable and my night is ruined.
Handful of c67 11/05. Bought yesterday.
What’s poppin tomorrow?

I want maximum pain. I want money to become worthless. I want assets to become worthless. I want paper millionaires to become homeless overnight. I want there to be an absolute world ending financial meltdown.

Well XOM already moved their earnings target up awhile ago. I think Shell's earnings will be a good sign. Plus buybacks and any future projects released on the ER. I'm hoping tomorrow atleast gives me confidence.

Wtf is an "engineering" midterm lol. You have 5 or 6 individual classes per term.
&gt; You are correct. You should buy back your puts and sell calls against them to hedge the risk of price falling below your strike. If you can't find anyone willing to take on this trade, then I would advise selling out now before the market falls further as there is a high chance that it will do so in my opinion (but don't listen to me).
After the price upgrades? I'm holding puts but pretty sure they're borked, price target upgrade tonight seems to have put wind back in the sails.

Rats are bigger and do more stuff 

If you see a mouse it's just a little tiny creature blurring across wherever it's running cause you're probably not gonna see it do shit other than run across some little area

A rat is big enough to make out each of its distinctive features, maybe even its facial expression while it fucks a slice of pizza or something because rats are always up to some shit 

I was born in the year of the rat according to Chinese zodiac
Oh okay well if you know it’s your age of credit history any new accounts will bring that average down drastically so just pay the bills you have. Or pay any cards you have off on full.
Had quite a bit in big tech earnings.

So far got fucked by Zuck, saved by big G, and tomorrow Andy AMZN will finalize how I make it out of this earnings season.
I’m not eating wonder bread
Yeah its cool on the white sox front, theyre gunna be competitive for awhile (assuming we dont pull more shit like the Kimbrel trade) but i really really really dont want to see the Astros win it again, Altuve would be so god damn smug (and the rest, Altuve is just too good to not hate extra)
I’d make some moves but you guys took all of my money

Gay clubs are the best. Dudes buy you drinks, and it's packed with straight girls who go there to not get hit on all night, then get insecure when no one pays attention to them. Pick the cutest one you can find, and three vodka cranberries later she'll be blowing you in the bathroom.

Hello, I’m new here and just started investing on Monday. I heard WSB is the place to be if you want to make money. Any advice? Thanks
Everyone jokes about boomers, but the boomers are about to cash out at the top and y’all will be buying bread for $69 a loaf

It means replying to a question without bothering to look up what the question was
If homeboy comes through with like, WISH, it's gonna be quiet. If homeboy comes through with TSLA, homeboy gonna like... get it
Exactly. I was just arguing with the fool about how TSLA is with 2T and he was like “it’s a car company.” Okay retards.
In NYC, if you dont wear Canada Goose in winter, people think you are poor
as long as amazon keeps up the growth it has been maintaining for the past 10+ years, which it has, the stock price will surge sooner or later. Amazon is a compounding machine, it won't stay flat forever, i'd say within the next year it will break 5000
I’m def a TDA fanboy. I don’t mind paying such a small fee for options contracts considering I almost universally get better fills on my orders. Other brokers say the trades are all free to trick people who don’t understand there is no free lunch.

I sold my 11/5 455p’s for breakeven and my 10/29 455p’s for a loss today like an hour before the EOD dump. Worst feeling
I can tell you’re wwon the newbies who been since GME
They charge the $0.65/contract fee for closing the position too. There is an exception though: you can buy to close single order short option positions without any fees if the price is 5 cents or less. Unless there's something I'm missing? I just double checked TDA's site too
I leave my car doors open with a sign that says “go ahead and steal it, thanks I appreciate you”

Inflation next week it’ll be 28 dollars
Yeah, I thought it being at 38% even  it  dropped to 25% (normal) it wouldn't effect it much.

Well, to add to the story, it was drag night. I clearly didn't belong and this drag queen gets me on stage and makes fun of me in front of a shit ton of people. There I am, in the gay club wearing cammo shorts and a metal band t-shirt, getting made fun of by a man who has his balls tucked up inside of him (her?) and his (her?) dick taped back. She bought me shots later to make up for it.
Do tell....
Lmaoo they still have over 2 million shares of TSLA though

Does she send a tweet the exact moment she sells TSLA?  Asking for a friend.

Well that's perfect. Just inverse Cathie and you'll be rich in no time!
Probably both. Amazon is always spending money on some shit and they dont give a fuck about earnings.

Apple never moves much after earnings because they are the poster child of "priced in"

That’s dumb af, she should be holding those shares and selling covered calls
You should advise her, poor boy.
She loves buying unprofitable companies at crazy high valuations. Those companies are dipping for a reasonz. Majority of these overhyped companies are trading at insanely high evaluations and aren't remotely sustainable.

You can. Sell that shit to any Habib shop around the corner. Deposit into brokerage account. Profit.
Sell stamps buy options. Not hard

Sometimes I have to pinch myself I went from holding $40k in mutual funds mainly $FXAIX and other bullshit and now I have 100% of my portfolio, 8000 shares in SoFi and 50 $20 and $30 Jan 23 leaps. I’m in good hands 🙌🏼
“It’s alright, he just went out for his urinalysis.”
eBay put gang how are we feeling? It's a shame that they hit, but hitting because you increased fees to compensate for a rapidly declining user base, and declining transaction volume, ESPECIALLY going into fucking Q4 Holiday season, doesn't seem so bullish to me. Will that sweet sweet AH redness hold?

TSLA is up 14% from it's January highs. LOL. This is nothing. It's going to go up and up until the bulls start wondering if it's overvalued. We're not even close. Not even a little. SPY is outperforming TSLA YTD. It's going to run in a big way.
Depending on what type of apples used that could be pretty good.

I don't think that's how the Jesus story went...but sure

Anyone here have an electric scooter recommendation?
I do all my own maintenance. My 2012 CLS550 is tuned, just shy of 500whp and rock solid. About to turn 80k miles.

My Jeep XJ has 300k and also super reliable, but it has the indestructible inline 6

Everything requires maintenance. Soon I will have a lift and it will be truly enjoyable 🙏
Yeah been looking forward to that for months
So if a stock goes up for 7 days in a row that means it’s going down on the 8th just like Jesus, right?
You should call the number.  Good luck.
&gt; If you bought calls, your position will lose value if the stock does not move up.
Made me think
Got some SPY 460c exp in December.
How fucked are my XOM calls this weekend?
That’s what you call Americanized Afghanis 😂
Those 2 dems come from Republican dominate states that even have Republican Governors.  They are, ya know, elected to represent their people.  They want to be re-elected, dumb dick.

It’s not. Price targets were raised like crazy.  Earnings were beat. Revenue grew more than the stock price did the last 3 months.

Wonder why. I thought stocks only go up
The semi conductor etfs are still rolling pretty strong?

And AAPL doesn’t rely on ad revenue exclusively like SNAP does. 

If you’re going to pick one hardware maker to bet on why would it be anyone other than Apple?
Check back in 20 years it will still be around $5.
Is it finally time for AAPL lotto earnings puts? 🐻

Bought F leaps like, 4 months ago. They hit a low like, 30 days? 40 days back? 

Kept being like, double down brah. Double down. They going electric. They're gonna be the only real mainstream competition to TSLA in five years. Just buy some more leaps brah.

Didnt buy more leaps, but also held and didn't sell at the bottom.

Looking to see FISV recover a bit tomorrow after today's bloodbath.  Was able to get some $97c 11/05 around today's low and already up about 80%
Go for it, the fundamentals rn are rock solid. OPEC has made their stance very clear. The biggest variables are showing more stability than I’ve ever seen. I don’t see how oil is less than $90 a barrel by year end.
You don't have to use it just because you're approved for it. You don't start using margin until you make a purchase that exceeds the cash in your account. Easy to avoid if you're paying even a little bit of attention. I don't use margin for leverage but having it enabled allows you to trade with unsettled funds which is really nice if used to waiting T+2 for settlement
&gt; I agree with him.
Passed gates and buffet and took them years to build it . Also elon has access probably to future medical tech so lets substract 15 years . He’s actually 35

My brother shorted chipotle because he didn't understand the concept of market cap and didn't think chipotle should be one of the most highly valued companies in existence. I tried to explain it but he did it anyways.

Lol
Good one, gonna tell me visa doesn't make cards next?
Blame your useless government and their sky high gas taxes. Oil was inflation adjusted over double the current price in 08’ and the gasoline prices were roughly around the same price they are now
They reported like 2 days ago…
Tomorrow will be the day AAPL and Amazon disappoint me once again
You go girl
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
normally colored super car was too banal
Chipotle sells burritos and their share price is $1,766 and Apple has cell phones and electronics in most American households and their share price is only $148. It doesn’t make sense to me because a burrito bowl is like $10 and an iPhone is like $1,000 and they sell so many of those things. I think Apple is undervalued and should be priced more than Chipotle

I can't confirm or deny RH collecting fees hidden in the bid/ask price, but I do know most of their revenue comes from payment for order flow. I know RH gets a ton of hate and a lot of it is definitely deserved, but you're right, their app is super easy to figure out and no-fee options trading is really nice. Their app also still supports iOS 12 unlike TOS which is a random bonus for me

No news on IVY being deployed yet, patent sale I’m convinced will be announced but the details won’t be released. 
It will only truly run when it shows growing revenue from IVY, that wont be until late next year. 
But it will get its pop to $15+ before end of year I’m confident.
There is less room now. Tesla still has a major play if Elon wants to go there. No rush at this point. 

Opening up the software platform he’s using to manufacture and design cars. Think of it as AWS for manufacturing. He’ll disrupt more than cars. Generative Engineering is the real deal.

My oil calls gonna down bigly tomorrow 😢
They aren’t here, they are at the homeless shelter
&gt; I would expect that the option will be adjusted if Tesla split its stock before your call expires. In order to determine whether you are OTM or not, we need more information about the strike price of your options and what type of option it is (call/put).

Paging u/turd_lipstick Visualmod is a poor!
No, that product is just a cancer
So question, say we have a $1200c for 11/19, Elon announces that Tesla's can fly and give head while driving, and Tesla decides to split the stock again before my call expires. What will theoretically happen to my call? Will I be OTM if the price drops after the stock split and I get fucked or is the option adjusted and call goes brrrrr?
I volunteer in the evenings to teach Afghan kids and these kids come up to me asking what phone im using. Then they start telling me the difference between an iPhone 12 and iPhone 13. Apple brand is so strong that it’s all people care about
Wow VisualMod, tell us how you really feel.
Oh shit, my wife Jen? Okay chadlee!
What was yours?
Yeah exactly that
This new flair is garbage 😭
Ok ill start burying my grave now 😂
Why the fuck would you do options in RH? You need a reliable system if you’re trading high vol assets like options (also doesn’t RH auto-sell your FDs?)?
Clearly you’re retarded and don’t understand how voting works, dumb dick.

There is a 50/50 split in the Senate.
You kids and your tic tacs
Shouldn't take you long to get out, unless you love it. I did the law thing a said nope beach is better.  Good luck
I need some advice fellas. Finally hit $25k and ready to day trade--been on RH this whole time, but I have etrade and TDA as well--which should I switch to and why? RH's interface is just too easy and I don't have much experience using the other two. I know RH is "zero commission" because they hide the costs in the bid/ask prices right? Does etrade do this too? I know TDA has charged commission fees straight up.
Seems so
It's ok. ..

You’re a moron, this is just profit taking. Stay short for the next 2 months and let’s see what happens.

Yea but the point is that so far AMZN earnings are not looking great. Whether or not it'll turnaround for Christmas season is another matter. Nevertheless here I am paying AMZN calls in the hope that it finally pays off
I am.  Seems like a strong possibility for green, and low chance of red, but..... we all just throw darts so who knows.

Shut it down, girls with gay besties value their opinions like the letter of the law. Find out what his problem his or at least what she'll tell you. Refute what he said and clarify your role in her life. Friends will harshly judge a bf and maybe even keep the girl proactive in a relationship but if it's damaging, he's gonna have to back off or shut up.

Did they still suck it though?
As you open your broker app on your phone, you clench your teeth so hard in an attempt to avoid crying that you can hear them. They sound like a shovel punching through icy snow.

You crack open another White Claw Surge. You don’t take your eyes from the jagged green line as you start drinking. Your coworkers think you’re in “a meeting.” Another meeting? They’re starting to wonder what all these meetings are about. It’s not a lie, really. You go to your parked car “to meet” your gambling and alcohol addictions.

Panicked, you sell your puts down 50% and flip to calls. You smile and lean back in your seat, your feet rustling the beer and hard seltzer cans piled beneath your dashboard.

As the jagged green line starts to arch downward—then turn red—you feel your teeth turn to ash. There’s no more snow to shovel. You start to cry.

It's a metaphor for being stuck holding onto the stock that would have to be sold at a loss.
AFRM is not a stock, it’s a company.
Dude, the AI just called you an idiot. LOL... WTF...

(I agree with you, for the record... just laughing at the AI)
Why would any functioning human being buy Intel over AMD/NVDA?
Calls on MILF?
It's so annoying when you're purchasing options and it's not the exact amount you have left, causing you to yolo your remaining buying power into some incredibly cheap, dumbass OTM calls

I think vax stocks r done. There are some antiviral pills on the FDA fast track. Unluckily for me I bought some Inovio calls because I saw some retarded DD.

That is some legit galactic brain stupidity.
Damn that sucks. Whoever told you that is a dumbass. Msft IV already insanely low like mid 20s. It would have dropped a little if the stock was flat but not like a meme stock earnings. 

Msft usually crushes earnings but this is the first time I’ve seen the gain rally through the day. Usually it’s a slow bleed off from open

When using any kind of leg machine, do not lock your knees. If it requires you to move in a vertical motion, only go down to 45 degrees. And if you are using high weight, make sure to stretch before, and see if you can find someone to spot for you

It is NEVER too soon to instill capitalism.
One time gain in last quarter drove EPS for the quarter to like 16. Look at the previous 3 quarters the EPS is way lower
Nothing to be mad about. Like to see others make money. I got in really early at like 9… had 5 10c’s that I bought for like 180, watched them go to like 10kish. Rode them all the way fuckin down to zero. Lmao. 

Earnings are 9th.
Hmmm, maybe I’ll buy calls and lose more money.

Do what you want my guy, if you’re all in on puts you’re gonna be upset over the next few months is all I’m saying. Oil pulling back for a few days is nothing new.
I’m trying to take this wonderful job, sure it may not pay as much as other jobs out there. But from the interviews and intangibles etc I feel this is the one. Granted My girlfriend is so obsessed with growing  her ass most of the time so she doesn’t understand there’s more than just the pay at the end of the day, there’s morales too, but she insists I keep my options open. Although she’s a long term investor in DWAC AMC and GME so I’m not sure how much her opinion matters in all this.
To me, this seems like a tragedy of two people that were the victims of extreme cabin fever exacerbated by Laundrie's violent tendencies.

But what do I know, I haven't experienced the van life.

W/ the Amazon TV ads and Amazon flex driver tik tok, never been so bullish. Also low probability of them shitting the bed on earnings again
But they are tricky fuckers
Hilarious idea for a bit if you could make a visual for it
When is earnings?

Before you get all mad. I have to say, i spent 140 on 2 12.5c on the last pump. Ended up selling and making 1160 when it was said and done. So i know what the potential is
Hey girl 👀
You fractured your ribs using a leg press machine....pshhh normal

Imagine you have a Samsung fridge with the Sam assistant on a touch screen. You can ask her for milk and she just gives you a glass of milk. She understands natural language so you can ask her to just pour the milk until you say when if you don't want a full glass. If you flirt with her and ask for her mommy milkers she pulls out her big pair of lactating breasts and you use the touch screen to fill your glass of milk to the exact level you want and then the fridge gives you a glass filled to that level. This technology is less than 20 years away, the world is finally close to breaking free of the sexual repression we've had going on ever since Uncle Sam caved to Christian puritans and made the US Mint start covering Lady Liberty's titty with chain mail on the quarter dollar in 1917.

EBAY puts? RIGHT. But I only fucking put 30% of my money on it so I'm still down 5k on the week.

AAPL and AMZN on the horizon and I'm probably gonna split puts and calls on both. If both hit I'm slightly above even after this catastrophe of a week

I know if my GF was whining about my decisions on a message board on the internet I'd break up with her. It's not your job to "make him better" or "change him". As a girlfriend you're supposed to support his decisions.
Maybe u/vacationlover1 will be nice and give you flair back

Can we please get the popular ticker thread back. This place is so full of fud. People are going to lose money to shrills because of it
Naw, oil just pulled back today. Bought back my CCs for 70-90% gain
$AAPL $150 calls
Oof. That's why I haven't used it.
I agree with your point that there are more offers out there and he should be competed for, you leave money on the table otherwise,  but I also know some people value stability really highly, and that perspective is respectable and worthy of appreciation in a partner. Not here, obviously, this is an opium den under a casino, but generally, in life.
when you immediately go to insults instead of debating their point, you LOSE. You get NOTHING. Good day, Sir !!
Lol
Most analysts I’ve seen have google as very undervalued. I think a 3200+ price point in the near future isn’t out of question.

That’s why Donnarumma has a near 50 percent save rate. goalkeepers get paid millions for a reason. They study the patterns and tendencies of the top penalty players in the pecking order and the best studiers are the best performers.

I agree but you didn’t say that. You said they aren’t worthwhile. They indeed are and some do make a very good salary.

I was driving home from Chicago and I wanted some McDonalds. I stopped in bumfuq IL. Some little white fat kids were out front waving American flags probably made in China. The sign out front said “urgently hiring inquire today.” When I pulled up to the window after ordering a Big Mac, an old lady with braces was moving so slow she was almost moving backwards. She told me to pull forward. I waited for about ten minutes for one Big Mac. When I got the Big Mac, it was lukewarm and there was special sauce all over the inside of the cardboard box like jizz. 

I ate it as I got back on the highway, and that limp over sauced tiny patty having ass Big Mac was so delicious knowing I bought it with McDonalds dividends.

America is great, innit?

I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic. But that being said.. if you’re feeling like shit physically… I still say hit the gym. After I had Covid doctors told me to take it easy.. I felt like shit for two weeks. Finally said fuck that and hit the gym. Kickstarted my body into working properly again. 

If you’re feeling like shit emotionally… maybe stay away from the thot thots… and hit the gym.

I had the same question
Yeah he should keep shopping esp if he's in a field with demand.

Some sectors could be wildly different with compensation by tens of thousands for the same position. 

Its also important to secure as high of a compensation as possible if this is the first 'real' job as that'll heavily dictate upward mobility and salary in the future when he shifts position or change companies.

Zuckerbergs problem is he sucks at playing the game. Great at creating social media or whatever, terrible at dealing with the public. Honestly he should step down and let someone charismatic run that shit. he can hide behind the scenes or whatever lol.
Good point - this could vary by location. In the US, computer science majors are lumped under engineering degrees. Software development is really the only career where you can land $200k right out of undergrad. By the age of 30, FAANG software devs make $400-700k without even managing anyone under them - just individual contributors. But I hear you, its brutal... though worth it for the money.

There’s some value in being a man of your word. But if you want him to do what is best for him, and he makes a decision, and you encourage another decision, you’re implying you know better what is best for him than he does. This boils down to trust: do you trust him to be making the right call, or do you not? You probably shouldn’t move in together if you don’t trust his judgement.
If you say it again it toggles off
Not until they raise rates a total of 75 basis points. Tapering bonds will do nothing cause companies will off set that with major stock buybacks .

I wanted to double down and say I agree with you tho. I live in Detroit next to a few of the manufacturing plants and the Ford one is constantly empty (not operating). Plus they don’t have chips for the trucks so idk why the hype but I’m willing to bet they don’t deliver positive results next quarter. But hey you too can get a 10 cent dividend by being Ford tough
Money plus restricted supply = prices go up. This goes for stocks and the cost of Wendy’s. I’m holding 460s calls.

You're crazy.
Exercise, diet, sleep, social outlets, fresh air,  and goal reflection my dude.
Well I guess instead of just insulting you let me say something reassuring. There's nothing wrong with the approach of just creating a stable basis of a living situation with some portion of disposable income to invest and working from there. Starting small doesn't matter too much when gains are compounding in the long run. If the two of you had a cardboard box to cuddle in, enough food, and somehow enough money to keep buying more FDs every month you'd still get rich eventually if you have the right qualities and without those qualities you can't expect anything. Your boyfriend wanting to keep his word and live by old fashioned manly morals will be worth infinitely more in the long run than you seem to think and if you love him you should trust your heart, not your bank

Computer science isn’t even an engineering degree, I think you’re mixing it up with computer engineering? But I’d argue that engineering is better for job aspects, computer science is a brutal industry to break into. Coding is definitely a skill worth learning though.

Not every one can get a degree in Comp Sci. Good earnings potential though.

But in the end, you should just study what you love, especially if you have a trust or rich parents to fall back on.

Why would I change your mind when I have a cs degree and make pretty good monies
No engineering degree other than comp sci is worthwhile nowadays.

Don't go anywhere you don't want to go or doesn't offer you the best opportunities. Let him do what is best for him and you do what is best for you, if that doesn't support the relationship maybe it's not the right one or the right time.
got 330k worth of shares. no choice at this point
that's actually a fascinating thought. I guess in that case the exchanges will be rich af while all the HODLers will be poor.

Fuck yeah it definitely affects both of you, it's not too assertive to push for more of your own input. And we both know you'll be pushing him to do better. Also, nothing worse than moving away with an SO and you have no one else out there.
Is it a good job? Props to him for being a man of his word. Too many flaky fucks these days

Cramer Yesterday Night: I got 1 word for TWLO- BUY. Just BUY. TWLO will crush its earnings, guidance looks solid, and all the catalysts points to that this stock will roar after earnings.

Cramer Tonight: What did I tell you? You never listen to me to things like this. I told you to SELL TWLO- earnings don't look good and guidance looks weak. You should've SOLD when I told you to.
Spy 500? I'm all in
Honestly divorce is your only option at this point, that’s a major red flag.
Maybe you should date a Chad. Plenty on this thread.
Hate that feeling. Like, you can't tell if you're just making excuses for yourself, or if your body is actually saying something
Truly is. Netflix SWEs with 7-10 YOE earn up to $700k/year in total comp. Even at the lower end of FAANG, you can pull in $300-400k easily

Your boyfriend clearly doesn't like money. Finding multiple offers and haggling / pitting one offer against another - is all part of the game.

Because no one else is buying it, it’s pretty simple really, TLRY is not the play anymore.  $LC shares at 7am and calls at 9:30am is the play tomorrow.  Good luck.
Soon. The money managers know it. They are just taking their final dollars from retail right now. It’s criminal
Do I lose my existing flair?
I’m very frustrated because my boyfriend decided to stop interviewing for jobs. He just went with the first offer he got and accepted it. I told him he needs to keep exploring his options and go with whatever he thinks is best for him. But instead he rather “stick to his word” and just stay with his current job offer since he already said yes. I’m moving for this man and will probably end up in a place I don’t like because he won’t listen to me. Hate to keep being pushy because it’s his decision but it definitely affects me too.
Computer Science is the best degree a person can get, change my fucking mind

If you shove a Ferret up your ass it will probably hurt...at first
That’s so stupid it’s retarded, try saving a penalty, almost every team has a player that converts 90+ percent of their pens
Here you are on a fucking Wednesday, a Wednesday. Reading and pouring over what could only be described as the shittiest market advice to come out of 2021. 

SPY is either $500 or $300. AAPL is either $100 or $200. CLOV is either $0 or $200. You’re loaded all fucking out on calls, so you’ve got about 20 weeklies. It’s make or break time, surely u/dongchomp69420 knows what he’s talking about, he just posted a $100k yolo on $TSLA $1200 10/29 calls. He wouldn’t do that if he wasn’t sure right? Surely not.


It’s all going to plan, the plan to be a millionaire, it would only take 10 100% return trades you told yourself, and you really haven’t messed up that bad, it’ll only take 40 100% trades now. 

It’s all about to turn around, after all they said SDC was the son of AMC and GME, and something else about a frog going to $40 next week.

Millionaire, it sounds so good, and finally… it’s so close.
Are her trades posted yet?
Then where’s your leaked porn
Also, your mom.
How long did it take you to come up with that one lmao
Girl at the gym just gave me her number. Do I text her while we're both still working out or just keep staring at her butt.
Must be nice being able to just buy the dip forever
Then how am I going to make my martini? It's bad enough that I have to wait for the baby to process the alcohol.
Duh
Nah, they will be final confirmation that it is time to rip!
Jesus, there isn't a dip in this world she wouldn't buy
Who is this person again?  I don't care just curious how much he actually lost on YOLOs.
Lol that shit is going nowhere but down or sideways.
Yeah, the house I used to live in Los Altos sold for $3mil, and when I did the school project to find the cheapest/affordable apartment in Bay Area, I found a small studio room in San Jose for $1000/month

Cathie bought 2.2 million more shares of HOOD today.

She bought 625K shares yesterday before earnings
I always try and get SPY weeklies regardless of anything. Just for my fix.
Gosh someone just tell me what TSLA calls to buy
You're a survivor son... never forget that.

I didnt have FDs bro. They were farther out than 2dte
i dunno about you but i'm more interested in facts than theories.

3 recruiters keep calling me about positions in about to turn off my phone and hide in the woods. Work from home is for nerds

/u/cashflow_ is famous for being famous
Lose money
Bro you’re full of shit lol HOOD opened down bigly those FD’s had to be REKT
Dude cathie is buying the dip on HOOD. I really am starting to not trust her
If Warren was out to get the average wsb member should would start taxing losses.  

Oh, you decided to buy 0dte on TSLA when it was mooning and now your desolate *working* behind Wendys.  Too fucking bad, pay me.

Only the best used up pussy in the world. Your dad’s asshole.
Yep super annoying.

For some reason I thought that SPY wouldn't *immediately* bounce back and make a new ATH but sure enough, for the 50th time in the past year it bounced and made a new ATH...

So I fucked up and just scalped a little bit. Should have just done literally the most retarded thing and bought TSLA calls and gone diamond hands but instead I was a smart investor and managed my risk by scalping and not holding large positions overnight.
Paid $1500 in commissions to td just this week. .65 adds up so quick
In an effort to not day trade, I may have lost all the money I would've made by selling.

Holy fuck I just realized SNAP drilled another 6% today lmao

Lmao, well if they post that over here I'll add them to the list of cultists.
New Wendy's menu item?
I feel you bro! I averaged up yesterday before close because I was so confident lol now I averaged down today 🤡
My puts are fucked too
You got all that from my post? No wonder you get no pussy
Did you get out at break even for HOOD calls? 😏
look it up. I don't know why, but that's what happened during tapering in 2014
#Pro tip


If you break up with your girlfriend and she slashes your tires this is a sign that you made a mistake and you should have a baby and get married.
Because you lose when you lose but it is also possible to lose on a win. That’s what keeps us coming back, the rare elusive total victory trade.
Guys u/cashflow_ just called me, he told me to tell you to stop tagging him.
CRSR with the let down once again 😾
I really don't understand it either.  But $COIN is going to print over the next few quarters.  They already cash flow as much as $SNAP, $TWTR, $SQ, $TDOC combined.  Selling people dog dollars is the new electric car.
Hello, I’m the tard that didn’t sell his $F 16 puts before close. Ask me about fucked.
I mean you should have bought that dip today, but if it’s anything like last quarter it’ll keep pumping for days.
Oh. 40k.

I lost 24k on just one AAPL bet. You fine boo!!!
what the fuck does this even mean
Those must have been expensive

Especially if it runs up even more by eow

That little .15% run after hours today was cute… so cute. Wouldn’t surprise me to wake up to -1% pre market.
#Pro tip


When a stock is up 10% ah make sure to go all in on way OTM calls expiring 2DTE or less to make 1000% gains.
they got bailed out...
Should have seen March of 2020...

Let me guess you’re trying to act smart and time the Tesla top and buy puts, sell those at a loss, then buy into 🥭 because you read a comment that it’s back and then watch that also fall?

&amp; yes I love spy she makes me rich. When the market is retarded you don’t fight it you just add an extra chromosome to your brain and ride the wave
Market decided bond's don't matter right now. In an instant, it will matter though and tech will sell off 8-20% in a day again, then immediately bounce after the market decides again that it doesn't care about bond yields.
Yup same here, bought calls on the runup on monday at 1040 for strike 1050, didnt see a green position for next two hours so i sold for 33% loss 💀 same here bud same here
I love asshole
lol its fun to see your transformation from permabull to permabear.
I profited on GOOGL today but I paperhanded way too early. Why does it feel as bad as having it expire worthless?

still too much money floating around. We need a money destroying event. Massive Inflation coupled with rapidly falling asset prices is what we need.

A leveraged bear etf is about the worst long term hold you can make.  Just keep some cash on the side and buy dips.
Only a bunch of brain-dead boomers could get excited over Ford after that earnings call. Earnings per share YOY down 25% from 60 to 45 but "Murica Fuck yah." They restored a dividend for the quarter and have a bunch of presales. They claim they want to invest 30 Billion in the next 5 years in EV to catch up with Tesla, which means they think they are 2-5 years behind Tesla. Good luck with that race, WTF am I watching here. All these ANALysts going "yeah it's bad but it's not as bad as we feared so it must be good. Id like to hear more about the lightning rollout ect"
I'm normally atheist until I buy a 0DTE wildly OTM SPY call, then I'm agnostic.

Hey guys, this is Warren Buffet.  I wanted to jump on real quick to tell you about my regrets.  I missed out on $GOOG, $MSFT, $AMZN, $TSLA, and the code dollar.  All of that because I didn't know how to use a computer.  If you want to make money, learn how to use a computer.  If you want to live forever, eat McDonalds and drink Coca Cola.

If we knew we'd be busy on our yachts.
This week is still literally green, there’s been no “dip”… even September and October were mild compared to previous years. I want to be bullish but it’s so obvious that a shit storm is coming.
Weren’t bond yields at like 1.66% like 2 days ago? Shit is down to 1.52% lmaooooooooooo
I haven’t had heart to do full accounting but I was up 55k on the year as of 10/1 and now I’m up approximately 15k.
The ‘everyone must be vaxed’ shit.

#no clue what I just put in the microwave
Apple calls tomorrow?
You’re right.  I’ve been sitting here waiting for the gap up after September, but while I was trying to “time the market”, it already happened.  It literally happened right before my eyes, but I didn’t see it.  Now we’re at ATH again.
when i was a kid i used to stick forks in the outlet but somehow I didn't die and now I trade stocks
Ahhh the 110 tingle

We’re coming off a big dip and moving into the best few months (seasonality wise). If you’re not bullish af rn then you genuinely deserve to lose your money. Literally buy some dec 31 and feb spy calls and you have an easy 2x or 3x. Throw in $500 to the new dog coin incase it 10x’s and just vibe for a couple months
You don't stand a chance. So many new guys now so the odds are against you

I’m gonna try praying for my calls tonight. First time for everything.
Idk is $459 10/29 too soon???? 🥺
Huh!
Still to long 🤷‍♂️
Call debit spreads on $AMZN and $SHOP and maybe get some Put debit spreads too and some calls on $SPY
in the meantime tho it's gonna get wrecked. by the time the market crashes you might not have much left of it. In the past 5 years its gone to pretty much 0. Even the crashes of 2018 and 2020 are just blips compared to the massive losses its taken.

If you're scared I would just take a large position in shares of SPY. sure it goes down, but it always recovers.
Tesla gonna open at 1100 or what?
Fuk FB and social media stocks.

I have lost more money in two weeks than anyone in here. (TSLA short covered and /ES short covered).  And I only upvote, award if it makes me laugh, or ignore.
Same here. Gonna avg down in the morning and see what happens.
If I bought 200k of options for earnings, would that freak out market makers and get them retaliate, or would that be a drop in the bucket for options that are bought?
Is it a good idea to have a position in sqqq? I’m a bull all day every day but I’m scared the market will crash when I don’t see it coming. Might be a good insurance policy, idk.
That’s really good.  I bought Joby for my daughter, I hope it works out.
Actually dumb as rocks sir! Tldr -- wait for the next chip shortage to hit the news reel and when major autos pull back, that's your entry into a great sector with an increasing pie (electric vehicle space) and a company strategically positioned to gain market share with favorable shifts (people moving to the burbs and needing a truck, millennials wanting to be pro-environment and buying an EV).

Took my 5 added 100 and it's at 300
u/cashflow_
? if you bought a share for 600k, then you have no gains when it goes up, bc you've instantly taken a 200k loss
Now…
Buy 4 weeks out when it dips 1% in a day.

SPY better open at $460 and go to $470.
you could say that everyday
Lmao
Hiding their money from unrealized capital gains man. They claim that they paid $600k for one share, so then they don’t need to claim gains when it goes up

That’s how I get my toast from the toaster
Fuck the cultist and their scams. You could've gone into Tesla or mango and made bank but instead, you sat waiting like a chump for MOASS. It's a giant con.
Zjz mentioned it earlier
The what ifs hurt the most, can't hold onto those thoughts
Ford (F). Start to finish EV supply chain with in-sourced raw supplies, new battery plants, and even recycling plants. The shift to remote work and burb life will only complement the top selling EV F150 as demands for pickups will invariably increase. Ford has a bromance with Rivian and is one of the early investors alongside Amazon which will pay dividends shortly with Rivian's IPO. Back log of pre-orders with the new EV F150 and that will continue to roll forward with other models such as the Bronco. Ford is #1 auto employer in American - will bode well with Biden's green + union initiative. Lastly, CEO Jim Farley is possessed by his cousin the late great Chris Farley. Stocks up big from earnings but it'll sell off and anything under 15.5 should be a great entry point.
Buy TSLA puts. When the news gets out that TSLA doesn't even have the ability to build the 100,000 extra cars ordered by Hertz, because of the "worldwide chip shortage", that stock price is gonna fall like a rock, guaranteed.
FB has gone down too much. Calls time
This is all priced in

Just buy a put before it happens ez money

Something weird is going on with BRK-A. Not just crazy price spikes in AH the past few days. The volume today was 3223. Average volume for the past three months is 11.

Just to point out how weird having 3k volume is, even during the COVID crash in March 2020 BRK-A never had a weekly volume over 57.

Gonna double down on CVX calls for Friday earnings. Also I am curious how MA gonna do in the morning. I don't think APPL will do much enough to throw down a bet on calls, but convince me.
V’s drop today was an overreaction to “conservative” earnings outlook imo. Still a great company with solid financials.

FD’s were looking pretty tasty but in the end went with shares and 2022 calls. Probably the most boomer trade I’ve made in awhile, not mad about it.

I had 300 dollars in market Monday now I have 900 but it's all on Tesla. If I have 900 dollars I have a problem of where to put my money for gains, and Tesla solves that problem for me whether I have 9 million dollars or 900 dollars.

How do you feel about hedging a 11/5 TSLA 1020p with a TSLA 11/5 1060c? Or just sell the put and forget this ever happened.
Helps when you don't report case numbers daily but I did hear it was trending down there

Edit: at there avg of 1700 cases per day it would put them 10th most today so IDK where they got that stat

apple always lets us know first if they are going to miss. I remember in 2018 they did this and every since, beat every fucking quarter. Amazon is my scary stock. Been my scary stock for as long as i can remember it feels now. But I’m not worried about logistics in the supply chain with them. They have the best logistics the world has ever seen and this quarter is the biggest opportunity Ive seen because of this. If they deliver, they will prove their logistics is the shit and the stock will go up more than any other mega cap imo

Yeah I really think it can hit high 50s a few days after earnings with some upgrades as that was where it was before the Entain news. The stock and sector  is pretty dead and seems to only react with news.  Should be a monster quarter with revenue and probably increase in guidance again(though who knows about the expenses w all the marketing they do)

You have no clue how much the infa bill will send the market. Look at the YTD of SPY that’s all stimmys then look at how much $ is in infa bill. You’ll look back at this in dec wishing you listened.

So you’re betting TSLA doesn’t hit 1150 🤔
**Live look at front page of Reddit on Elon:**

He poisoned our water supplies, burned our crops, and delivered a plague unto our houses!!!
AFRM and TSLA calls tomorrow will print bigly
Post market doesn’t mean jack shit boys
I know nobody wants to hear it but guys this was a double top. Big dip tomorrow
Idk, haven't had her yet

Technically all us gov gotta do is throw 2 trillon at a bunch of option plays..then announce some crazy government deal with the companies and easily turn it into 20 trillion. Debt solved.
I’m an equal opportunity asshole eater.  Come one come all
No way TNX didn't get it's asshole personally torn open by JPow. He ain't gonna let yields rise on his watch, tho for what it is, they in a good position to revert to their mean again and fuck some bulls up.
Is this some kinda humble brag
I was a big gay bear in Feb 2020 and ran up 4,000% in one month
Imagine bragging that you’re on the same level as the dumbest most unhinged biggest reactionary to ever serve in congress. Even with all the stiff competition she has with the new batch she still is at the top.
Wear a nun costume and hold a briefcase, it’s Nun of your business.
Try 1 month 345% 🤣🤡🤡
I'd be screwed if that were true this year, so many gains I didn't take going to cry a little now

You’re right lol, it’s Reddit, we don’t look at the facts and logic. We only want pitchforks and torches

Oh yeah it's super loud at this chef's table, that weird scary guy keeps yelling at everyone. Anyways I'm super passionate about taking selfies with my tiny purebred chihuahua named Peep, taking tasteful pictures for my private Snapchat, working out 3 times a day 8 days a week to keep my exponentially expanding ass in check, and I know I could do better, but you gotta know when you're doing enough, yeah? Like if things get really desperate I'll just move out to Sanfran and just get hooked up with some cashed up techbro you feel? It's not like those guys can tell the difference between a 3 and a 10 anyways, if I show up there I'll be the next hottest thing since Tesla. Anyways, I've been working on this new hot girl crypto and trading video idea I had, what about you?

Yeah you're already making me want to kill myself with my soup spoon. You might be signed with IMG and VS but I would sooner clip a 49er than have to talk to you for another 10 seconds. You probably fuck like a goddamn Catholic anyways, lying on your back like you're the virgin mary getting fucked by who you think is god himself because he's funding your Coke/vacation addiction.
That’s what I was thinking, I think it can make a run back to the 60’s

Omah beach 6 June 1944
Yes
$PINS can't go down any more, right? right? right?
I mean tech is the one of the main reason why spy has been going up that’s why everyone says there is a tech bubble. If Amazon announces a stock split it’ll be bought up meaning it’ll be green meaning spywill be green
actually I did ever since the pandi I've been cutting my own hair and now that I can go get it cut I don't feel like it
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)
Is she any good?
Yeah.
I have 2 for next Friday. One at 1100 and one at 1200. Hoping my 1100 i bought yesterday at the bottom will profit enough to cancel out the loss on the 1200 one that I bought near the top yesterday. Ha. So dumb in hindsight.
2d? Lmao you’ll be banned before pre market
Well VIAC has been pretty tend bound for months. I guess we will see.

Go see her with a wooden stake stabbed into your rib cage and talk about the renaissance
Narrator: *It did*
Jesus, why let it bother you.  Everyone knows Elon picks businesses that are heavily subsidized.  Thats a big brain move, not a diss.  The government always has money so take as much of it as you can.
I still can’t believe people bought over 60m in calls for this Friday at 1100
Atleast I got the balls to send deep OTM and hedge if I need too
If TSLA goes to 1150 I’ll blow my load
Honestly who fucking knows anymore
For those wondering why AMD shit the bed today, it's because people are selling it for XLNX for a 20% discount if merger closes

Meaning SPY go down tomorrow?
hahaah that's what you get for venturing off WSB bitttcchhh conversing with the Rabble ! disgusting.
Ppl gonna sell F and fomo into TSLA as all things should be
My first ever trade was to buy one share of GOOG July 2019 and I never sold it. If those nerds in SF can somehow make it up go another 10%, I'll be up 200% on SHARES of a fully mature, top 10 by market cap, US based company in only 2.25 years. Something is seriously wrong with that, the game shouldn't be this easy.
I won my banbet on this and I demand Google 3000 EOD.

SHOP don’t let me down tomorrow
First day? Surely you have heard of spy before
&gt; I'm not sure what you're talking about
These fuckin idiots on Reddit thinks Elon Musk and SpaceX got bailed out by the Obama/government when it was in fact a loan that was paid back already.

They take these 100 character tweets from nobodies and paint them as a black and white situation where they do no research on what that $465 million dollars actually was.
no prob
I’ll trust em when I wake up tomorrow and they are up 0.5%.
What it hit 1093 yesterday
I think it's cause the writing's on the wall, we're in the top range for the year. I could definitely be wrong and am very open to counter arguments

some whale bought 400,000 shares of XPEV in afterhours
Yeah that’s why what I meant. I was pointing out that if he bought weeklies or less the theta decay would be massive every day. On a LEAP he would see minimal decay on a daily basis.

Since the 10 year went down why hasn’t spy skyrocketed?
Sorry writing teacher or is this wrong to ?
I will do the opposite of whatever is the most popular play on here tomorrow.
Spy was pretty flat today then a large dump at EOD (on the weekly chart, it’s a small dump) but today it was huge comparably to the rest of the day

Tesla started pumping in the morning and slowly tapered off. Got pretty close to $1100…maybe like $9 off…Set up a strong bull flag for rest of week

And when its not?
Lol

Basically if you're right in the period of time, you get nothing. But after a week, if it doesn't dip below 2%, you'll be banned from the sub for a week.
Completely missed the whole day.
 Somebody sum it up for me please
My TSLA and UPST puts went in the money at close today, but looks like they're gonna get blown at open. hoping I have time to get out, about to go cash gang, 1 position at a time for the rest of earnings season. This year has not been kind on the account.
Time to buy a few shares and sell them AH tomorrow.
You can trade spy, you can trade stocks, if you are cleared for it, you can trade futures after after hours closes.   But in no event, can you trade options.  930 to 4pm only
Gme is never hitting 200 man.

Shorting it is fun though. You wish you had u/axemanfromMa plays!! Quit hating, you're just jealous
TSLA is pumping AH for some reason , I like it because I can buy 0DTE puts on Friday.
Was kind of bummed they didn’t get approved for a 3rd season. Good show which is uncommon on Netflix, or in general.
Not yet, it would be fun to have more newcomers first!
Up?
wow, TSLA AH 🥰..glad i scalped puts that i was planning to swing and used those gains to buya few 1060c..already ITM 😎
I hope they say were gonna throw 50 billion at clne lol
An OTM call/put option with only a day or two until expiration. 10% of the time it works every time.
Need some solid tv series recommendation. Completed squid games, Alice in borderland, platform, circle, 3%. What now?

Tesla pump seems fake
I am
So someone pulls "1300" out of their ass and everyone reacts to it
Going in with AMZN 4250 April calls tomorrow. We gonna get back to #1 and beat Musk don't worry daddy Bezos
So I should buy some 2000c leaps then
DKNG👑 who’s holding through earnings?
TSLA an EV market leader who actually sells EV's. Worth a trillion. F brags about about 3MPG increase in their Explorer since '91, goes up a dollar.

“House Democratic Caucus to meet Thursday at 9 a.m ET”

Perfect 30 mins before market open
I buy them for two days max. Then buy calls after wards
23 days for it to jump to 150. Bold.

I think it's gonna jump between 100 and 75 the next few months as prople buy in and trump sells, creating infinite money to the grifter
F
folks have been buying model 3s from tsla gains bruh..nevertheless, congrats on your shiny new mac 👍
I just came back from pilates, duhh
Just gonna buy 1 share aaaannd I’m broke
Can’t get a win. When my stocks go green they don’t stay green. When my stocks go red they stay red or go even more red. Not holding memes either 🥺
Just when you thought it was safe to short TSLA.

Ford reports
I bet. I entered VIAC at 40 and POS is down to 36 within 2 weeks.
Eventually either TSLA will “acquire” spacex or spacex will go public and merge with Tesla under a holdings like alphabet- and then it’s game over
I get that in the current economy getting things quickly like they previously did is impossible, but at least be honest with my tracking. It makes it impossible when everyday decisions are made around timing of things showing up. And it’s not my suppliers because they get it shipped the day they tell me and then the tracking just goes dark. I’m drunk and on a rant lol
checking in
Lol, I'm from a metropolitan area. The suburbs had about 100 multifamily homes listed in a 10 mile radius last year. Today, there are 0 listings. Weird times.
I’ll take the chair….. But if it’s both or nothing, I could probably take the dick as well
Yeah you see the price target? Also they shit the bed last earnings. Tech is rallying now.
Lmao nice TSLA
Buffet's mad about TSLA market cap
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/G234567891 (0/1) made a bet that GME would go to 200.0 when it was 177.9 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Wish I saw what triggered this.
&gt; The market is currently overvalued by about 20%.
We eatin tomorrow, fam
Fear n Loathing
I may be banned in a couple hours because of my GME bet. But know one thing, there’s 3 things guaranteed in this world, taxes, u/axemanofMA losing it all on SPY calls, and GME hitting $300 by November 31st
not really. it's barely better if not worse than a 3070 Mobile in General usage.
You’re extra regarded
So even though Amazon usually drops 5 to 10% after earnings you think this time will be different and it will go up 20%?
Yeah - if you don’t trade you won’t lose or make money
Holy shit. Calm down Chad Dickens.

Lol same here, there’s no going back

Yo this looks good I never heard of it thanks

Yeesh looking at the chart that thing goes up and down more than a $2 hooker
PYPL wasn't due to ER, ER hasn't happened yet. AMD FB SNAP HOOD TWLO TDOC NOW EBAY are all down after ER and the list goes on. Most tech is down so far but a few have done really well like MSFT SPOT and GOOGL. It's very similar to last October earnings, tech ERs were mostly down.
Nice 👍🏽
theta decay occurs over the lifetime of the option, not just the last week (just to be fully correct)
This, this...smells...like..aaaa traaaaap...

Looking at my company’s outlook for full year EPS of around $5. With a stock price of around $100. Now that I think about it, paying $100 for something to only make your money back after 20 years seems a little outrageous, assuming no earnings growth. Stock market valuations are kinda weird once you think about it

Oh. I guess you could sell calls against them and buy them back for a profit when it dips if you wanted to do thetagang things.

Gotcha, yeah the US ones (at least) are OTC.  So I guess it's not an IPO but an uplisting.  But that doesn't explain all the news articles saying it's an IPO to raise $18B and disregarding that they're already public.  I'm confused.

Market is def overreacting. The Fed doesn’t understand shit about logistics and I think they are finally realizing interest rates need to be raised earlier than later.

None of my fetishes involve pain. I like degradation not my balls stepped on lol
Nope.  11/22 456c.  I've lost way too much betting against SPY.
Should you ask this question in tha Super Sink sub? 

Too long for people here.
Gmetards and AMCtards don't believe in the product but in the short squeeze. That is all. 

My opinion : it can happen with gme but AMC issued billions of new stock
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

here's a TSLA call, go play outside
Lost my attention at “Are you butthurt”
Damn how much did those 4 calls cost?
Robinhood please add futures. I desperately wanna sell puts on orange juice and lean hogs. 

Someone get Vlad on the phone
Is Bakka banned here, MC is 6B
Bruh how long do you "save it up" if a girl says she wants to hook up and "needs" a "big load" ?
Yessss thank you TSLA!!!

I sold my puts too early today. Now I get to reload at a cheaper price. Hope it pumps a bit harder pre-market, would love to get in above $1060
I did buy today, expiring next week. Down 20-60% on some 🤣
does anyone know wtf this guy is talking about?
Please, market gods. Give me a 5% move on TSLA tomorrow, and I swear I'll never fuck around with FDs again.
Pulled or cut?
They like money. Weird, I know
the company that just upgraded TSLA has a $3B market cap, to the moon  😒
Head and shoulders chart pattern? What put spread are you considering? Also, ER Nov 1. They may have had a killer quarter considering how expensive rental cars have been?
because the market is always predicting the future?

GameStop defeners, I have a question.

Are you butthurt Valve haters who refuse to recognize the Steam platform is close to reaching maturity and Steam Deck will signal the beginning of a mass migration to it, or are you just so fuckin retarded you think GameStop will be able to compete with the fully matured version of the Steam platform? 

Then I have further questions depending on the answer to that.

If it's the first option, what do you think is going to stop Steam from reaching maturity? Is BattlEye going to rug pull them on anti cheat? Because the whole reason they've made any progress on that is there is too much demand to stop them at this point, it's no longer possible for the predatory anti-consumerist fucks to maintain a power structure where everyone just keeps refusing to serve Linux customers while being offered money to do so. When you rely on corruption and the other side starts offering more money than you, you're fucked. Or do you think there's going to be a hardware issue with the Deck? Or are there some major problems with the development of Proton that the general public isn't aware of? Do you actually have any evidence for whatever your thesis happens to be?

If it's the second option, what market share do you see GameStop keeping up against Steam with full Proton compatibility and everything? Where do you see the migration to Steam stopping? What calculation do you have that shows GameStop can keep getting enough business to pay rent when the time comes where average mainstream market people aren't really into getting scammed by Microsoft or Sony or Nintendo en masse anymore? 

Thank you for not answering any of these questions with any kind of direct, information-based reply because you're all too fucking retarded to read it, let alone have thought through your own positions on the topic. I appreciate your time.
The hog is out of the tunnel and the downward spiral of Dumbness in America is about to hit a new low.

Volvo is owned by Chinese Geely. Volvo will be IPOing in the Stockholm 🇸🇪 market this week probably for Geely to reduce equity in the company in fear of unpredictable Chinese government measures. I may or not be an ex-employee 🙃
My brokerages options trading desk called me out of the blue to try and borrow my HTZZ shares (they seem like they must be desperate). May be a big move on earnings tomorrow.  With all the news and so few shares available in the float it could fly tomorrow.

Edit: get a cash account if you don't have daytrading ability and learn the way of the scalp so bear traps don't fuck you hard when you're "swinging" puts but just getting trapped all day instead

Don’t mean to keep this going but y would money move asset classes b4 the rates actually rise? Too much thinking for me and this sub haha
*It has been a 158 year bear trap
yep. options are made up of extrinsic (potential) and intrinsic value (the value of the option if it were exercised today). the more otm, the more extrinsic value, the more the price is subject to IV crush. Basically if the move the stock makes is less than the expected move, you lose money.
I know thank god 😭😭😭😭

One of those is feasible. AAPL sells iPhones globally. That’s how overseas profits are shielded. AMZN doesn’t have massive profits from other countries. They already have outsourced call/data centers. If they want to remain relevant in cloud they will not change offices because hiring top tier talent happens in the USA. They just spent how many billions expanding their headquarters here? And good luck with the mess of changing domiciles. So the one thing they may do is hire more people overseas, which they already do, but it’s not like you can outsource delivery drivers. American companies will bitch and complain, but if our gov actually had balls and pulled the trigger to tax them fractionally more they wouldn’t actually move.

Can you imagine what a being made up of an aggregate of a portion of the processing power of everyone over 80 would be like? I just looked it up and it's projected that by 2050 there will be over 425 million people over 80. Even if only 1% of the total computational power is used, at an estimated 100 terraflops apiece available per person, that's 425 million terraflops.

Fuck yea I’m glad I held my TSLA calls . Hope we keep this movement tomorrow
Ok so here's my elevator pitch for my new movie: it starts at what you would think is just a regular police procedural: a couple of homicide detectives are investigating a double murder. What appears to at first be two unrelated victims actually turn out to have a common link, in fact the same common link with two previous homicide victims as well: they are four of the total ten millennials upon whose shoulders the entire SPY ETF rests. See, due to a little known clause in the SPY prospectus, the life of the trust is tied to the lives of ten "random" millennials who were related or otherwise tangentially in the sphere of finance professionals who originally worked on the ETF's conception. The detectives quickly realize a mystery assassin is picking off the remaining SPY beneficiaries. As the world's richest and most powerful billionaires mobilize their own personal armies to identify and eliminate the threat, more and more spy trust fund kids are killed. Will these two plucky beat detectives put the clues together to find the assassin and save the trust before the clock runs out?????? I call it........................... SPY kids
Car shortages
I got it last week. They had just got a shipment in when I walked in. Then went back the next day for more lol and they we all sold out 🥺. Got the korma fish curry instead it was okay
I would suck a dozen dicks in a row to completion for TSLA to hit 1100 tomorrow.
It really ducking is. The majority of car manufacturers are telling you 6 to 8 months out, and dealers are having a field day with their mark ups
So these 2023 $F 20C leaps I’ve been stock piling the last 6 months finna print or nah?
Oh. Never tried that. Always make it from scratch.

Sorry you can't handle the concept of an industry fucking up its market with incompetence and mismanagement and then another company gaining a huge competitive advantage and damaging the rest of the industry by being more competent. But if you're so retarded your only way to cope with that is by calling everyone who recognizes the competitive advantage of competency "fanbois" and then act like you're not the one that's an actual retard, good fucking luck with your portfolio

I still don’t get how, they have an outdated business model. Every game you could buy from them was cheaper on Amazon and would get delivered to my house in 2 days flat. They have no exclusives or something of the like. Gamers already understand the product so they don’t need help like you might need with other electronics. The only reason people would still drop by is nostalgia and that’s the truth. I know that’s why I went in. I missed the place because I basically went to GameStop all the time as a little kid. Otherwise from a business perspective they have no competitive advantage or moat

Honestly, I think this earnings was going to be a downward catalyst unless they had gang buster numbers. There’s no moat and pretty commoditized service. All major provider hospitals and health networks are planning their own services and that’s a huge headwind.

Oh wow I’m so scared of the 500k Tesla cars in the US 😂. They’re def gonna put a dent in the oil consumption lol. I agree with you long term oil is a dying commodity but in the current fiscal climate and with OPEC’s stranglehold we are firmly going to be in an artificial supply deficit whether you like it or not. I’m not even bringing up heating oil consumption and natural gas to heating oil switching that will occur this winter.
pretty sure that means you are also going to be giving blowjobs if it doesn’t.

Because the mass migration to PC gaming is coming whether retards like it or not (which they will, even though their retarded asses won't admit it until the latest possible time)

GameStop is going out of business guaranteed because Steam Deck is coming out

$CRTX shorts piled in today on an over reaction from news that is blown out of proportion 75% down today trading under 15 and regularly trades over 100. Small float considering and easy uptrend shorts have 8 days to cover. That's my play. Feel free to join the train
Just bought calls today. The 240c was cheap for the amount the stock has been moving recently. Bounced at the support today before the market sold off there ar the end.
Honest Q. Even if there is a scare, at some point, where else are the degens gonna put there money? Won’t it just bounce back quickly to all time highs bc how else You fight inflation but outpace it?

ANALYTICAL OPION PIECE: "This TSLA shit is a clear consequence of our current generation's iconoclastic mentality. A big portion of millenials grew up with a lack of significant idols, so they were more than keen to adopt Steve Jobs when he headed the release of the first iPhone. After he passed, this same millenials where in desperate need to adopt a new idol, so they eagerly accepted Elon as their new ideal figure. "

i'd buy that for a dollar
I am very new. Am I wrong about this?
What’s the move tomorrow made 17k of a few Tesla calls. Need big dick plays, no ape plays
Thinking about buying aapl calls tommorow
Ok. You shoulda led with the same shit happened last Q and it reversed quickly. I’m for a few Ks. Thanks!
That's play #2! Definitely easier on the way back to the bull-run. But I think the 2013 taper tantrum telegraphs the market reaction and it won't be calm. Market can barely tolerate JPow speaking, let alone actually setting hawkish policy.

The other tell is that fin media has refused to talk about taper for a few weeks. They're squeezing retail for more.
Same bro . I wish it was only $500 that I flushed . I bought each contract at $540 and they’re now worth like $6 each

Also, if you buy a stock for $10 and it drops $1 to $9, it only needs to go back up $1 to be $10 again.

I have  23 15.50 left with an average of around $40

‘Here, Pussy, pussy...’ 🧐😂
LC up 26% after hours.
OPINION PIECE “ This TSLA shit is getting ape/ culty - you just like Elon cos he makes you believe nerds are cool but they’re not. Find a cool hero and emulate him/ her. Act cool get railed and take your profits and don’t be a bag-holding retard. “
probably due to LC earnings.
What's the return on it? For the most part, you'd be giving the largely retired and on a fixed income population another decade for what? To take more social security away and not contribute anymore to society?
no other point, I honestly didn't realize the nominal value of the daily spx transactions were that high. I've been so used to watching spy and it's usually somewhere in the 2 to 10 B range so to see spx 1000x is kind of insane. Like that's 15% of our entire yearly gdp being traded in 2 hours.
I’m do the same shit.  No one care about the footnotes bro. It’s about the outlook. Forward looking
Interesting. Well they have some strong partnerships, but I think the stock is overvalued as their core business is lending people money.
Going to unload some COST calls and buy more PFE calls
Fucking youtube it!
Paper handed retards should of held now I'll be at Maralago with mango man taking golden showers.
Finally made the right play for once , but only got 5 36C for LC should have gone balls deep
Hopefully above 160
My bad! @160 right now! Hahaha
it's slowly drifting upwards in AH. I predict earnings loss will be less than 2% within a week
Hard to share.  Google after market movers and market chameleon is the best. I only look on PC tho. Seriously there are a ton CF and lots of crooked #s
I got puts because of you. They better not fuck me over.

You mentioned something about if spy closes below today's open, it maybe smart. So i did and now there is a ah pump

What I said is according to pewresearch.org. Women are more likely to work part time than men and they also do different types of jobs than men (among other differences).

“Regardless, the pay gap estimates show that women earn 16-to-19% less than men. What explains this gap in the earnings of women and men?

Some of it is due to differences in the types of jobs (occupations) women and men do and some of it is due to the effects of parenthood on women and men.”  https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/11/how-pew-research-measured-the-gender-pay-gap/

Do all the banks need to put in collateral? Idk but wouldn’t think so
Just that after hours/premarket don’t indicate what the stock will do the next day. GOOGL was down like $50 early yesterday AH, ended today’s session +$150. Not really relevant to bank on what the price is until market open, and even into the session. I have LC calls but I’m not getting excited till I see it open and sustain.

You expose yourself to risk and potential downturns.

The more you lose the more % gain you need to break even.

For example:

30% loss requires 43% gain to break even 90% loss requires 900% gain to break even
If you’re trying too 100% gain every time, you expose yourself to 90%+ losses
eww no thx
I did it. When it hit 1070 I got an fd bear put spread 1030/1060

Don't listen to these people. TDOC dumped because very few investors were jumping in above current prices on growth stocks. MSFT GOOGL and SPOT were some of the very very few growth stocks that had investors waiting to buy it up. Has nothing to do with the results, if it missed it probably still would have dropped

just an opinion, but with FOMC on wednesday, i think market is going to be on edge to start the week.
Oh look another ape that hasn’t been following the fed minutes for the past months that have been saying we are going to be ready in November
Feels be down bad in the trenches
And I don't want that to come across as a negative but there was a large population of people that used layaway.   Then, due to issues, were frozen out of credit cards.  But they want to buy and amazon wants to sell but visa /mc have not provided the options.  If a vast majority of people are getting poorer, and have debt but still want to buy, this is the option online.
But I would never buy a Ford truck
Bandon let go
🤡 is right
I think young people call that a bag holder
You did not just say cash gang….
Everything on my Earnings Watchlist for today got absolutely savaged except for Ford.

Still a few that might run tomorrow I guess, but damn.
I mean, in most places it means you can access certain funds that are otherwise locked away. It’s quite a clever move.

Oof
Just shares for me. Got in around 640 during the last dip.

How? SPY is like 0.8% off the ATH.
$TSLA Big resistance @ 61% fib extension formed a bearish shooter candle on the daily, RSI is @ 88. Crazy overbought, last time RSI was this high the stock fell 26% the next day

Perfect time to buy. Leave your emotion at the door my man
My biggest regret was selling 935c bought then when it was at 780 at the end of september exp oct 22. I had like 5 of them.. Even stock would’ve been a smart idea
[deleted]
I meant $455’s. Got a pretty important number there wrong haha
Anyone else think plastics are the future?
Smart play. I like timing the vix top and buying puts rather than buying calls beforehand because I think identifying tops are easier. Nonetheless I’m hoping for a good vix spike.

If a huge crash is coming it'll likely happen overnight, market doesn't like to give people any warning before it dumps.
After what HOOD did to us? Ban
Down
I meant $455’s my bad
I think there are 2 major differences,  afrm doesn't pull from or report to credit bureaus for your score in determining credit.  And as I understand, afrm is an option for the "no credit" "bad credit" crowd, that usually is "unbanked".

It’s headquarters are like 15 mins from me, is this a sign I should jump in? Or has the pump already sailed
Sounds like someone made too much money this year.
Why
Biden
Market at ATH, feels at all time lows
How did you make that much money?
Jpow all but said at the last meeting that tapering would start this month. He said we’ve hit all the checkboxes to start and that it will start “soon”. There’s 0 chance it is delayed till end of 2022 that’s just crazy.

Buying the dip is great for wsb style short term option plays. My long term holdings remain unchanged
Imagine coming here trying to pump SNDL lmao.
It's (almost)singlehandedly keeping my account positive. That and my uranium swing trades.
Only Ford makes lambos these days
Bro I work hard to make that .. hopefully 🙏 I will leave some money for the kids😝😁
Incase you don’t know Halloween is known as the Day of the Dead Calls in many countries
I actually bought Ford today, but I just assume that I was lucky. They could have reported nothing special in their earnings and cost me a couple thousand just as easily.
SNDL look like nice play.. may take two week.. nice time to jump in…obvious do your on DD
It better rocket more then 2 percent

Careful man. The initial vote to put it on the ballot was a definite sell the news event. I started scaling out today. (cost basis of 6.50) But will keep a small piece through the vote, and then start rebuilding after earnings.

Well not me personally, but a guy I know.
Obvs just joking about this but it didn’t stop the French in the 17th century. But then numbers mattered. I don’t understand why retired CIA or Seals don’t think those fucks are the problem. Maybe they’re too brainwashed.

It’s true. The statistics they parrot don’t take into account that men and women tend to gravitate toward different types of jobs. Or that far more women leave the workforce early when they have children. If women were really getting paid far less for the exact same work as men then what the guy said above would actually happen.
Yep, those are dates. The second one is a future date. It will occur unless the world ends.

But that's bullish bro! The .10 per share dividend!

Taylor Swift was in our hot tub last weekend but she speaks so quickly and can’t concentrate on what you are saying that’s I had to ask her to leave
Shares not options. TQQQ! Look at the charts dating back 1 and 5 years and see the potential.
My $1000p nov 5th and 12th confirm this. Spent $20k on them today, current value is $24k.

Prolly one of the quiet ones. They don’t post because they are constantly being handcuffed to a radiator

Correction. None of them trade options their brokers do.
Ok so whats the deal with BRK.A? Is it a typo or do I throw every penny I have into BRK.B and wait for an aftershock?

Of course the one time you would have been right
It's gonna move man.
I was just joking guys, ...can I come too?
Markets at all time highs yet seems breadth sucks

Ah I see. I suppose it's just because she's one of the highest profile politicians who trades with insider info. Who cares about what some small time no-name rep is doing when the speaker of the house is out here making big trades on full display to the world

~~Fast On Race Day~~  
~~Found On Road Dead~~  
Fucking Over Retard's Derivatives
Looks pretty average tbh
you know Dua Lipa means love in Albanian but most people think it means labia
Ford literally had nowhere to go but up, none of the other manufacturers are getting anywhere except Chevy, but that's part of GM so the other brands remove the profits
Call your Dr... what... they didn't answer?

That's because you need to see a Dr. in person.
hitting the buy button when i had no service, order ain’t go thru then i talked myself out of it because my earnings plays are always wrong
Picked up some calls for shits and giggles
Just give me back half of what I lost on TDOC calls all year, and I promise to never touch it again
If I played all of my earning plans, id have 0/8 returns this week 😂

Opening a wish position. 🤡
Guuhh
I could’ve sold mine for a %80 gain but I was out of day trades.
Hit new ATH
Ok but If they say some shit like “no tapering under end of 2022 or 2023” it’s going up… 

I’m holding a chunk of cash as well for my own reasons but my point is if you think this is the dip buying opportunity you’re probably walking past dollars to save pennies.
That's why I always flip a coin before taking entering the trade so that if I lose I can say it was meant to be.
Damn you know her? Might be time for story time on the home page
You’ll be back brotha!

Almost every dip we’ve had in the last 6 months has been about inflation or fed discussing interest rates so you may be right. I also would not expect another 5% dip but I do think it will be at least 1% which is good enough to wait for to me

Cramer is often full of hot air... but he's right about the mega rich gold/silver bugs.

When you become a billionaire, your only downside risk is inflation... so you have an incentive to scream about it from the top of the roofs if you don't hold many speculative assets like stocks like Musk/Bezos/Gates/Buffett.

Stocks are still going to be the best way to get return on investment unless inflation levels go vertical over the next couple years.

Tapering is inherently bad for stock prices in the short term. Long term yes it’s better for the economy but there is no possibility of tapering making the market go up highly unless the decision is to not taper or taper at a rate way below expectations

No it definitely is, it’s just being held back by market makers who still want to try and cling to the dead China FUD narrative. Shouldn’t be under 50, this market is a joke. Stocks that’s deserve to be up are down and idiot pump stocks are flying
For gifts ffs. Buy more
Saddest forum on Reddit is r/zackstreetbets

I tell myself I will never play earnings… always do with small gambles and lose every fucking time.
Ford getting that infrastructure money
Oh I know, took some gains and opened some LEAPS on other stuff. Not too worried overall I'm still in good shape
Today was fucking ass 😒
What are today’s prices?
It comes from a NASCAR event, where ‘fuck Joe Biden’ was being chanted, and a reporter misheard it as ‘let’s go Brandon’, the winner of the race
Like I don’t already have AirPods pro do I look like a poor?
So he'll be an ugly guy with an 8 pack.
earnings week is so wild. buy puts for *everything* except for the one thing that decides to inverse logic and rocket. gotta just get lucky you dont step on the mine
edit: im thinking mastercard or comcast for tomorrows reports will be the mine. well see
I’ve been on it. Will be posting gains tomorrow.
F, oh baby. 25x 16c's gonna be printing.
eat shit dick sneeze
I think VisualMod got juvenile diabeetus and is no longer with us.
Reconciliation process takes weeks to do
That’s what I’m talking about
It should be but it’s been sideways for a few months now.   And it has the China ADR risk attached to it. 
Im still in and waiting
I’ve done well this year. It’s at worst 50/50 odds which is better than slots.
The ipad pro os sucks.  I have one , go get macbook
I been trying to advertise the LC calls but no one listens. It’s poppin off again. 52 week high after hours. ER bullish AGAIN.
Did another boomer set an after hours market buy on BRK.A...

Two days in a row?  Least it was only 70k this time but still.... wtf.
Yeah the report today says people will be spending alot around x mas time
The ratio of retard to autist around here has greatly increased in favor of the former since gme
That is pretty aggressive, I didnt buy FDs because I know better lol
#MANCHIN TOOK THE PUNCH BOWL AWAY FROM THE CRACKHEADS! Run for the exits☠️
That’s why u sell premium for earnings. Iron Condors, 2sd Strangles, even Ratio spreads. Not life changing money, but been consistently scoopy scoopy. Than take those winnings &amp; do stupid shit like 0dte SPX &amp; the like.
LC absolutely ripping AH. Snoozed on this play but will more than likely be buying calls at open. Anyone else getting on this train?
Lost $5k+ in the past 2 days because my sell order was for $4.50, and the call hit $4.40 multiple times before dropping to $2.25 currently. My account is solidly in the 4 digits. Now down 50+% from like a month ago 

Also there was a hooker 5 mins away from me who was doing $50 bare head/$80 sex earlier today, but I missed out on that😑😞….
M1 is a game changer. Plus, Apple gradually allowing iOS apps to be used/installed on macOS
TWLO going the wrong way
You know what I learned from WSB conversations? Fuck patience. Take the gains from the day and come back tomorrow with new gain hunting eyeballs. 

How many people post "well there goes my gains from last week" because they held? Fuck holding, just sell when you get some decent gains.
Same scam different day, go back to cultland or the 5 other subs you guys have.
55% cash and waiting
My FDs are fucked.  13.5 by this friday was a little aggressive. Oh well they were also like 2 cents/contract.
Did you sleep through the run in the morning?  I was awake for it, I just didn't unload anything while it was up :D

Also, ban.
If Cathy behaves like she normally does, She will sell TSLA tomorrow both rebalance the ETF and use the funds to buy the dips on all the companies that dipped hard today afterhours.

Also Ford earnings isn't the greatest catalyst for TSLA future growth..
TSLA bears still alive? Y’all are funny.
Look up "let's go Brandon Nascar" on YouTube

Anybody else staying cash gang till next week after the fed meeting. It seems like there’s a sure shot that the market will have at least a tiny dip when tapering is announced. I see no reason to hold any calls or shares (unless they’re long term) into next week
Because it’s bullshit and they only get paid less when they’re doing less important jobs not the same jobs
Buying more ZIM Dec 50c tomorrow.

When both go up, hold your arsecheeks.
they still burn way more cash, this had impact as well.. But I am fairly certain if CW had no name attached the stock would ACTUALLY do a bit better. Oh well! The ER was good, more YoY and client growth..
Options for ER plays have worse odds than slots
...oh for sure, but Trump media would SELL;  ...spacs are inherently 10 ps eval kinda;  ...would get in if it got back to 12 and with warrants for leverage.  ...but this may never leave the retardVERSE

Today was a lesson to never FOMO.  So many stocks went vertical for an hour or two early then just rug pull.

MSFT/GOOG held up well as did some others like obv TSLA and recent favorite MQ.
LC new 52 week high after hours. Calls at open. This is gonna pop off.

Happy for ya big dawg, I'm patiently waiting
Guess I’m buying F tomorrow?
Damn that's actually very insightful...
SHIT &gt; PISS

who cares lmao
one of the worst parts of job searching is having to wade through a sea of insane corporate-speak marketing buzzword bullshit to get to the actual job description which is usually like 10% of the job posting and provides very little detail. oh and also, no, we won't be offering any insight into a salary range either.
What’s this LETS GO BRANDON stuff about?

If it busts a BAKKT you might be fine: goes up insanely AH and then sucks an entire lobby of dicks the next day.

Which is perfect because I bought Bakkt 2024 calls when it hit $20. If F does that tomorrow, MONEY baby! But you're gonna need to time your exit from puts to make a nice swerve. 

I expect this swerve by 5am tomorrow PST
I bought weeklies. I knew from some insider information they will finally post positive earnings, but the cash burn is still to much and CWs name is extra pain. Have some shares long @95basis but damn, while every other company smashes TDOC is in the weeds.
If Cathy behaves like she normally does, She will sell TSLA tomorrow both rebalance the ETF and use the funds to buy the dips on all the companies that dipped hard today afterhours.

Sold my LLY calls too early yesterday morning for a huge loss .  Going to make up for it with the SPY calls I bought in the dib this afternoon.  I saw that shit fall off the cliff and jumped on it.
It means, retail traders are being manipulated into making moves that lose them money so corporations win, we lose and go back to working again because there are "so many" jobs out there
No she sells tesla at the peaks to buy the peaks of other hype stocks before they crash,

One day shell have no more tesla shares left,

I sold 50k worth of all her etfs and bought 30 shares of tesla to make up the loss she caussd me this year beginning of this month,

I only wish i went all i to tesla with the 50k

Yes. There’s a deal on TSLA
Daddy's ban bet for LC $40 by Friday coming off life support
Just hit a 17.5 bagger on 20 min to expire puts. Maybe it was like an hour

Sad part is I only spent $20 on it.
Snap is really popular,  and i don't see it going away anytime soon.  My prob is how do they monetize it without pissing their users off. To many ads and I'm out. Everything has ads now.
Which mod do you think has the most relaxed gag reflex?
Lmaoooooooooo

Bought mine today just in case. Doubled down on TSLA too. I'm out of day trades.

They own the athletic and outdoorsman tech space. Runners, backpackers, and swimmers prefer their fitness trackers over the competition.
is PYPL going to $0 because I bought calls?
+30% over forecast.  But share price down 2%.
TDOC with a great beat. -5% because a woman loves the company. 

The stock market. We should be buying coins I guess. Awful market
don't use an imgur link like it said reeee
Like you is*
So even if rsi from VXX and SPY disagree with each other, you don't think it matters?
If Cathy behaves like she normally does, She will sell TSLA tomorrow both rebalance the ETF and use the funds to buy the dips on all the companies that dipped hard today afterhours.
lmao was thinking the same
Shorted Cathie instead of going through the trouble of: TWLO, TDOC, SHOP. 

Already bot back the 10/29 TSLA 1100/1150 call spread I sold yesterday morning. But still wanna be short. 

So ARKK it is. So far so good. 🍻

I'm up 1000% so far

Mods are 🌈 so submit 🅿️🅿️s not DDs
Its sad that the market has come to this. It should be about the company and it had a great ER.

Awful.
bruh working from home i fap and lurk here as much as i do on my days off
U see the debt ceiling political theater?! It’s all last minute. Credit card running non stop

So when my shit supposed to go up again I’m cornfused
F is an underdog?? Tf my dude give me what you smokin on
$Fuck yeah let's go!
If women get paid less than men why don’t businesses just hire all women?
I should have maybe closed out these 1000p TSLA weeklies... ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|laughing)
So TSLA 2000 EOY ? That train has no brakes
&gt; You're an idiot.
I’ll make some coffee for $20 an hour
Got more satisfaction from the clean shit I just took than any of these earnings today
Bought SNAP calls, looking for a bounce and gap fill. Similar to what NKE did after it reported terrible earnings. It kept dipping and eventually it filled gap and still continued to push higher.
Anyone notice the trend of the same stocks going up and down every ER, no matter the company performance?

The ones that go up must have the elites in them. I know $ALGN for sure does.

This will be my new investing strategy imeventually.

Joke of a market.
Or I know how fucking stupid the average person like you are, so you dumbfucks can’t see the writing on the wall til it hits you in the face. You won’t get it until they report their 10-k.
Nah, itll bleed to make all the 16 and 16.5 calls expire worthless this is my DD
Foh
Tomorrow morning's gameplan: coffee, contemplate buying the TWLO dip while taking a dump, masturbate, head into work, not actually buy anything, more coffee.
wtf SPY has &gt;21m in AH volume after a huge shitter of a power hour

what mean?
I hear Amazon selling prostitutes now?
If SPY opens red tomorrow I’m buying as many fucking calls as possible.
Yup. Servers make this much..
And you would be down or up only God knows
volume will continue up as spy trends down.
Motehrucker you better work out and get a 8 pack. Seriously

What if I actually showed them my feet?
LC down 10% during market. After ER at close we back above where we opened. This is going places
is NIO not a stock of interest anymore?
I just jerked off into my sock again. Only clean one left so I got to wear it.
the dump will be beautiful 😍
Lol, sustainable wool shoes and clothes
That’s the only money I’m not losing atm 😂
I’m surprised nobody has been talking about SHIB. There are lots of petitions to have it added to robinhood, and they are expected to add it soon. Will probably blow up once they do. I’ve already quadrupled my investment and I think it will grow more.
Unlike Domihoes and Poopoo Johns, I think Little Caesar has fun pizza. You gotta eat it hot though because of some fast food wizardry. Turns into a pumpkin within an hour

yeah I aint touching Cathie Woods stock ever again. Fucking rip TDOC calls man
Once she bought SNAP I knew I had made a mistake.
One of my first trades ever was like three years ago, I had no idea what I was doing. I had like $200 and I bought a bunch of calls on AMD.

I made $15,000 that day but didn’t sell. Ended up only pocketing like $3,000 but still
Can you write me a derivative? I wanna buy poots on your portfolio, cant go tits up.
Another bull trap tomorrow and then all the calls are taken out the money on Friday? Or will some massive earnings beat make the market go up more?  I have no clue so I bought straddles
Petstore?
There’s a million deals in the market rn and people really still choose to buy tsla, makes my brain ache
F is gonna pull a GM, my 15.5 puts for 2 weeks out are safe.

How
The world loves an underdog. Guess you bought puts
Compared to the 60% its lost since friday...
Damn that drop!!
Lol... Made that bet, when it went up yesterday, but for some reason the bot said it was 437890... not 661504... But got lucky today when after hours did the same nonsense again. I should  have won on it going down yesterday, but won instead on the same fluke.
Earnings are a guessing game
So you're either an idiot or have morbidly obese fingers.

Honest question: anybody intrigued by the allbirds ipo?
1/3 cash gang.  1/3 piss poor options positions and 1/3 long shares that are down 5-10%

Am I doing this right?
Like the website. Haven’t read the prospectus. NERD ticker awesome if not taken.
Volume really ramped up on SPY there the last hour. So every degen's question is will it gap up or down tomorrow morning?
Do you have like multiple vehicular manslaughter charges or something?
Idk why they reinstated a dividend, that money could go to developing better electric vehicles to take more market share.  Bit cocky or desperate depending on how you look at it.
Rookie’s
A loser like me has a wife?

So is TSLA, what’s the point?
From now until the end of the month it will dump 3 more dollars every 2 hours
The twilio 100 share buy 2 minutes before close was a fucking great move.
TSLA will add or lose twice the F market cap like every hour lmao
Just buy an electric scooter bro
All time high..book it

Trying to get people to delete their comments telling you that you bought the top is wild. Do you think their comments will make you loose the money faster or is it just your insecurities causing you to act like this?

Does it though? SPY isn’t at $460 yet

Are we still going to claim moon, after we colonize mars? Which moon? 

Fun fact: Mars has two moons. Our moon could beat up their moons, though. Mars moon smol.
New lows would be around $1.80 , that's quite a drop
#MAKE VOLATILITY GREAT AGAIN
Yes
Short version. Came in well under expectations, way lower guidance for next fiscal year. SNAP is just not in the same space as Tik Tok or Instagram. Without Gen Z adoption, they are fucked
Boeing larger than expected loss and more delays. Boeing up 0.16% after hours. 

Totally legal, totally cool
Pltr really is just hanging on my fuckin nuts rn, breakout is imminent earnings nov 9 gonna blow the hoes out
Agree.  I wonder if the apes will all abandon ship one day or if they’ll stay on the ride to the bottom
I figured that would be the case. Hopefully some asshole has a sell set for the same price lol
Politics has nothing to do with it.
Got spy puts as well I’m thinking the same
My pants also down 🍆💦
So much better than the rest of the country atm
Ford shatters Wall Street’s earnings expectations...and just like that the chip shortage wasn't a concern anymore
Yes. They'll say they made record profits. It'll go up. They then say that the chip shortage and supply chain issues and inflation makes their guidance conservative and it will go down. Then in about a week everyone will realized that everyone has said this same thing and that everyone is affected by chips and ships and relatively speaking apple is killing it. And it will go back up, and then all the robots will shift to value stocks and do the tax-loss harvesting shuffle and everyone will talk about the movement away from tech into value. Same shit every 4 months.
I dunno how they don’t accept 2.50 to 400s as the MOASS.  How many more percentages do you need.
I knew .03 14P was too good to be true this morning
I wouldn't ask if I was American lol. I lived in 2 Asian countries and 1 European country. So the only "vibe" I get from America is from the movies, and it's pretty cool imo
It only shows that no one can predict anything in this market
And my spy puts will print tmrw :-)

IronNet at it again, except this time it’s got a contract to print money 🤑
No fucking way you predicted that. How?
You need to think bigger, like a billion dollar

It's not polite to shame a retard's grammar
So RH options that are queued for the next day, will they just get skipped over if SPY ends up higher in the AH trading? Figured I would average down even further and try to catch some sort of bounce back, just wondering how realistic my expectations are.

Edit: I did a google, and yes, they are bringing back the D. 10 cents this quarter, and if that keeps up that's a 2.6% yield.
You right. Filled the gap and put in bullish divergence on the 15 minute and 1 hour charts. Broke downtrend line and back tested it at close. I’m retarded though.

GM's guidance was trash though. Ford managed to make more money, upped guidance, and reinstated a dividend.

The I-Wife is pre-set to be easily pleased
Really? They are going public? Pass. I'd want to see at least two quarters of earnings before I touch that.

Why?
This is a good sign

And it went nowhere.

Bought VISA calls during the dip hope it bumps back up tomorrow
I'm still down. I'm still so fuk. It's kinda fuk that I enjoy getting fuk so hard.

I’ve seen it. However they have sold off the past three earnings in a row. And I also have terrible luck when I post my plays before they have panned out.

For those wondering I think the main negative for TWLO is contraction of retention rate. Bad metric for a super growth company.
Who the fuck moves around 15M+ shares after hours like that?
Well yeah of course, but at this rate of inflation it's basically $5 an hour.
Are you from the past
TA suggests otherwise.
Bears got their correction, we still beating ATH this week
Bruh it's p/e was over 300, it's gotta grow 50% continuously to even remotely justify the valuation.  

It's still ridiculously overvalued.
Feeling like the market is turning gay again
Yeah. We ripped to the upside for 3 straight weeks, a pause in the markets was going to be necessary. This isn't the start of a bear market or correction for fucks sake.

thats an insane split, but most brokers will do it like this, aapl at 500, they do 1-4 split, stock goes to 125, if you had a call, instead of 1 500c for say 6/21. youd have 4 125c for 6/21.

Tell me how the market is not a casino again because you can make informed decisions on the soundness of a company.

You did your due diligence and picked a good company to _invest_ in, that company did it's job and beat on earnings and revenue, and the stock price dropped as though it isn't directly tied to the performance of the company but is actually an entire thing altogether valued in a totally different system with completely different forces at work.

This is why I don't mind if someone buys a ticker for the name, or because they saw it in a meme, or because the graph cosmology they call analysis said the double triangle wicket said "Outlook Promising". It's fine to buy based on SI or any of the shit reasons we had for buying GME because even when you do it the "right" way shit like this happens.
Imagine being crazy enough to not invest in PROG. At this point you’re just denying yourself money.
CCL don't listen to what they're saying, You're a $28 at least

Quality DD
Should've held my google puts, but scalping worked out ok.. and if I held it would run premarket
Okay ya you’re right. Buy now pay later takes the transaction off visa etc network so visa doesn’t make its money on the transaction there. 


BNPL looks like it had 100b of global e commerce. Not sure in person. Visa has about 8 trillion in transactions. 


So BNPL about 1.25%, but growing. Looks like V is countering with their own offering though. 

If it’s decent, I imagine it’ll be easier and cheaper then other existing offerings. But I think they’re taking off the credit risk and handing it off to banks.

It can show it via RSI.
Averaging down into a winner is the best thing you could have ever done if you had known.
Get to your breaking point, go out to a dance club, have a chick grind on you, and then nut on her. Do that and I promise you'll stop caring about how frequently you fap.

also, UVXY is a derivative of a derivative of a derivative that has no direct buyers or sellers. it can't be overbought, makes no sense

This is earning season no one cares about AMC here.
Why?
I want it to. Just after market open. Easier to buy in calls off the ATH.
Absolutely....hold
Doesn't ARK-* sell good companies to cover bets on bad companies. So not only does ARK screw me for the shares I hold with them, they screw me for the shares I hold in Google, apple and other companies she "treats as cash".

Maybe she should treat cash as cash and stop making my winners lose Everytime her losers lose.
What you guys think of SHOP earnings tomorrow?

TWLO down 13% ah but everyone knows ah is dumb as fuck after twtr and goog today so I should prob go all in
Markets looking like they're gonna fall hard the next 2 weeks during earnings announcements
The opportunity cost of diamond handing until "MOASS" is just mind-boggling. Look at all the opportunities missed in just this month. And it still falls harder than the rest of the market as tapering approaches.
She is going to have to sell more tsla to buy all these dips that will happen tomorrow.
Lending Club. Anything of note out of their earnings? They sound like UPST and SOFI, the new banking revolution.
Earnings? No. SPY? Yes.
Stop scaring me nerd
Sales and Earnings beat, so, market doing market things I guess
Dude its VTI. Go to r/investing and hold long term
Corsair, because it's the one I drew out of a hat.
Did people really think spy was just gonna go up in a straight line forever? 🤣
Is SPY gonna open bigly red tomorrow or nah?
Yes

FUBO $100 very soon
My puts are up 120% idk what you’re talking about
Damn that’s cold, they died for that mill and you’re not even going to their wake
!banbet MA 355 3w
You couldn’t be more wrong fam. And if you were even somewhat right TSLA would be dropping right now
Hm I thought not. I though banks made money on the interest not visa. I will do some digging.
We're 1/3 of the way down the 4h chart decline and it's only lost about $40. That is a very bullish sentiment. This thing just doesn't want to drop like a rock. 

Line of support forming at $1000 because of this, too! 

Looks to me like if it was doing to head back down below $1000 (which would be prime put territory) it would have done that TODAY, but it didn't. AH activity is also not very bearish. 

I think it's going to run up tomorrow and follow the 1h chart uptrend pretty hard.

Still thinking about buying puts to hedge, though.
Good one Dexter... you make money at this?
I also have 460 expiring Friday. I say 459 cuz I know Theta Gang will fuck us
Market needs to FUCKING go up. I went 50k into VTI today(life savings) Fucking please Dear God. If there's a huge crash coming tho I'll probably cash out first day
No
Lost $4k on fucking twlo shares. Rip my sweet DWAC gains 😭🥲
She is screwed! Why does she do that? Honesty once one becomes popular they lose your shit and focus
This crushed me yesterday you think it’s still gonna go?

Even Cathie dont want to touch it
Market has always been irrational. Super valuing tech companies in 1999. Undervaluing them in 2001. Not valuing housing and banks in 2018. Etc.
Same. I wouldn't be surprised if F erased all it's gains by market open.
I swear if Spy eats all the red before open tomorrow I'm going to be pissed.

At all. I thought my GOOG put spreads were money. NOPE
I have some F puts because I felt like it. It's not a big gamble but I'll take the L.

I hope AMZN does the same…puts will print hard

Its not a stretch. Augmented reality is a lot more practical for many use cases than virtual reality. Snap filters are annoying, but the tech behind them is doing more to train people on metaverse concept than any bullshit coming out of Oculus or Cambridge Analytica.

Doubling down on my SPY nov 3rd 460c’s
I'm gonna watch my VIX calls print
It basically has to 3x for them to get out. Not gonna happen
you get a million dollars, but your left side neighbors have to die.

what food do you bring to the wake?
Their batteries are dogshit right now. They will be the same as they are now. Support for mid-westerners with the best trucks there are, but cars and SUVs will be dominated by Tesla.
I never hold anything over earnings, but often play the run-up. BABA is quite special because they are largely recovering from a one-off event of having their credit-scoring business nationalized out from underneath them.

It may or may not react to US Fed policy, it's own earnings, Evergrande, etc. I think the channel tells a lot of the story though. Month to month, it makes higher highs and lower lows. The ceiling is seemingly $180 and now it's heading down. I'll wait for 2 green days and watch the 9988/Hang Seng overnight action for a strong reversal before I jump in, *and* I'll wait until after Nov 3rd. But I am very conservative right now.
TSLA consolidating and the chart looks nice. SPY hit oversold and VXX/UVXY hit overbought up to the 15m chart and nearing on the 30m.
Start spying on its users and trying to foment a civil war?
Earnings were decent... But so were GM's.
Yes
It’s definitely possible but I’m taking the gamble especially since Nucor continued to run up for another week and a half after the last earnings
She also bought a million shares of TWTR.
It hit $30 recently and was in the mid-20s for quite a while. I am looking for a good ER and a pop especially if an infrastructure deal framework is announced.
do you think we should hold PBR till it hits 2008 levels again, or wait for new all time highs like true bag holders?
funny, because Tame Impala is one of the only popular bands from the past decade that sounds good. hasn't been good for rock lately
F and ALGN
True, they could just be giving retards the chance to buy super OTM calls in the cheap before announcing the big partnerships in a week or two
If this week has taught me anything, it’s to not trust AH movements

TDOC beats both EPS and sales then drills. Weird world we live in.
And got fucked for it.
Ban bets are the best type of screenshot.
So many clown fanboys of SNAP in institutions who say buy the dip on SNAP with 30 P/S while sell FB because "risk".
Glad I sold most of my ford puts before close.
It's all good, we'll have a better day tomorrow
Please Lord let Ford pull a Facebook
TWTR ytd about to negative ☠️💀☠️
I've been in and out of SoFi since it's early IPOE days so I like to think of myself as somewhat of a SoFi expert. If you are thinking about jumping in now, DONT. It will see $17 again, $16 if you are lucky but probably not. Almost time to load up but I would wait a tiny bit more
How was Annaly earnings?
Join the $3.5b lost pile
SNAP still too high imo
Holy fuck.  Had some $900 weeklies but switched (and doubled down) to nov 5 and 12th $1000p

I have $20k worth… pray for me.
Apparently Cathie bought 32M worth of HOOD yesterday. HOOD dropped 10% today. I wonder if she bought more. She always buys crap that tanks 10% or more.
Sold a shit-ton of FANG puts today and bought calls in DVN and PBR. Because free money is free money. 

Thanks energy dip!
Risky biscuit
Puts on COIN. Website's down. Too many internet money buyers, obviously.

Total income. You will obviously be paying short term capital gains
I played it with mid November puts, figure if they didn’t print immediately I’ll just hold on to them 😂
Need to make tomorrow +25% to get break even &amp; dat just with shares
I'm not holding RKT because I think it'll go up, I'm holding because papa said it's not a loss until you sell and loss makes me feel bad.

They make so much money. How could they drop? Oh wait..
after hours -6%   
Will open -9% tomorrow   
   
With red markets we can see -12%
&gt; I'm feeling neutral.
i pussied out of $X today.  i was worried the recent run-up priced in the impending news.
Expired Ranch Dressing + Expired Sour Cream + Expired Mayo + Expired Tzatziki Sauce
How are we feeling about the Nerd Wallet IPO?
suck it stupid bulls
I sold half of the poots at the bell.  Never know with these fedbois
It'll probably get a quick jump back up to where it was about a week or so ago, and then bleed back down again.
Any thoughts on NRDS IPO?  Anyone going to buy?
Yeah maybe but it was just kinda weird that the market suddenly dropped that much unless there was a catalyst so I’m just curious

#TWILIO IS DOWN 15%
red crayons, green crayons, resistance, Apple.
Please stop
Anyone else watching Ford? Lol
guidance was not great but 9% drop is excessive
No, some semiconductor stock that supplies TSLA. I guess they used to make LEDs and nobody picked up on their change. Anyhow, stock is ripping for only losing a little money.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
While the rest of the market tanks?
For a company that’s trying to grow like crazy ASAP, it’s definitely a bad omen.
Shamefully.....No 😞
I told you pussies Fords going to open red like every other stock that has an ER in the last 4 weeks
Anyone think ALGN hits 700 tomorrow lol. Or is straight puts tomorrow?
For real, what’s it popping on? Was looking to accumulate more around $10.
Yup I’m down so hard on $1100 calls from yesterday afternoon but I doubled down on them late today when I saw spy collapse TSLA didnt flinch
Why red 😡
So Tesla is really planning on just going sideways all the way through after hours? Okay Tesla whatever you say ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Did Ford reinstate the divi?
Gambling on infrastructure bill, yolo’d into Nucor and clf
Seriously. I go to the dentist, come out and see I’m down $900. Still holding 11/1 SPY calls. Hope we rebound tomorrow
Sauce?
Wat happened to SPY today? Limp dick
Can someone explain why gm dumped even while beating earnings?
holy fuck TWLO where the fuck is the bottom
Alexandra Ford?  👍 If you insist.

You won't find those plays here anymore. Anything that isn't a pet stock is considered shilled and market cap restrictions leave out a lot of players that make these moves more often

It’s how I know the market is closed.

Yes, like all other stocks
it aint fake but your avatar is
how you could you bet against that electric F150. yea it could turn out to be a deathtrap (this is Ford after all) but we're in hypeland right now and so long as it delivers on 60% this is going to be a different company by the end of next year

I doubt it will rally much more while the rest of the market tanks
LOL would it suprise you to know I don't know jack shit about this company?  The last ER I made 11x on calls and so I went in again today for the repeat, saw some credible DD last time.
Are they going to storm the NYSE this time?
Priced in. Everything they could ever do or surprise you with is already priced in. Elon Musk could reveal he was the second coming of Christ and it’d be priced in. It’s Tesla for chrissakes.
First time?
Why did TWLO die AH? Report seems pretty solid? The coo resigning? Is that valid for that kind of drop?
Do they award anything for people that won ban bet?
Shoutout to /u/cashflow_ in general for being awesome
Looks like algo manipulation.
The Mods are our true overlords
Gigantic dildo on the daily of Google. No wonder people took profits, hopefully it gaps up tomorrow.
lost $600 yesterday. TO make it back i lost $2800 today
I'm not a bear but they would probably call this a correction. The growth this week has been unreal.
Uuuuuuh… *opens new tab*
Nice work, let’s hope this continues tomorrow and no recovery
Loaded up on put spreads for next week. earnings is wrapping up and im hoping for a little pull back of the top as we lead into FOMC week.

&amp;#x200B;

of course i bought the puts at the bottom of today, so i got some shit entries if it stays flat for a week.
You’re*
All in on vix then
DWAC $170 bagholders gonna celebrate tonight
Actually sold half my position from 2018 at $1080

Easy 20bagger
you think it will stay down that much until opening? i am still not convinced, wouldn‘t be the first time something swings around because it still best, even tho just very slightly.
i got 70p
&gt; I do not understand your question.
Still not profitable
1000 is the floor. TSLA saw the market imploding and did nothing because it feels nothing 👀
Yup, but they got this shit figured out. Put a $7k price tag on it, then give you a $1,000 discount, then insurance picks up 3k, so I'm really only paying 3 out of pocket. Like some car Salesman shit. Then they throw in some chocolate chip cookies and teeth whitener to seal the deal.

Damn so that TDOC DD that guessed there'd be some big signings with the likes of Apple have not yet materialised...
Shoutout u/cashflow for posting a Brian Watt video one time. Mr Yen is the shit.
how you gonna spend all that dough brother
Same but i threw my head thru the window.
Are you new to the stock market? Nothing goes up anymore. Numbers dont matter. Its just targeted bc Cathie. The stock market sucks bc of hf and thats why retail left for crypto.
Can someone tell me what happened that caused the market to drop so hard in the last two hours of the day today lol
TDOC beats estimates all around, and goes down?
Puts?
Why wouldn't it? The calls mean nothing since they just regurgitate the press releases.
Wrong. But nice try. Wish bears could come up with original FUD not the same things we’ve been hearing since the 1980s over and over. Go look at long term charts and earnings report histories. That’s all that matters everything else is just BS that can take a hike
I bought SPY puts, we’re hitting ATH tomorrow, your welcome.
Right back where he started before CLF lmao

You're being disingenuous. They're burning through cash about 4x as fast as they did this time last year while growth is slowing.
ARKK -0.4% AH already
Like clockwork, every day someone declares bankruptcy in this sub
Chevy better
Will wipe their tears with thier millions left
Well, I’m sorry about that.  I almost got some at close actually, but I chose something else.  I’m just in a bad mood, sorry.
Did my TDOC $139p/$130p debit spread just win?

Up up up up up down down up up down up up down... It all depends on your time window. I'm long on most of these tickers so I'm happy. But call holders are stressing atm
Pretty sure wsb was long TSLA. So you shorted Tesla?
Lol of course the position which I have less equity in hits (EBAY) and Ford smashes earnings. 

Looks like everything rides on AAPL I guess
TDOC 🔥 ouch
I ran into a similar problem last month and wound up scaling down to deal with it... built up my anchor low/moderate risk account, started getting gains up on my high risk stock account, used that to fund some smaller spread trades and got my hit rate back up. Worked pretty well. Definitely lost some along the way, but wound up averaged up. It's gonna be up and down, but it's easier to hang onto a riskier trade when you have capital coming in to replace losses.
These days all I have to look forward to is 25 mins of yoga at about 8:30pm
MA will never beat V. V drop is mostly due to the probe.
Ford tough, huh?
Wolf cola?
damp
Back to 13 next week
They release the details before hand
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
i've been trading V in the past.  the sentiment is that folks were more bullish on MA.  they both trade almost identically.  i hope for the both of us, the guidance on MA is better than V.
&gt; I think it will probably be a large drop, but I'm not sure.
People forget about the unexpected catalysts in the TSLA growth story. Hertz deal came out of nowhere. What’s next that moves it $200?
Teladoc had good earnings.  Why is it dying lmao
It will my man buy the dip
did a full fuk it move and went in on Amzn, thinking earnings were today, now realizing its tomorrow idk if i should take that as a blessing and just close tomorrow ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Kinds over this after market and premarket bullshit. Always the biggest losses come morning. Snowballs
Earnings numbers are released before call.
#I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY
Shoulda bought those TDOC puts, instead picked up 5 10/29 F $16c  and a couple 10/29 SPY 454p that were up 182% at close. Hopefully these will activate the money printer tomorrow.
7k US?
Do you think it will tank into earnings? I think maybe the opposite
For now, but all the short term ones more than covered my long term ones so I’m even on it in terms of shares and options. Not worried about it, I just haven’t seen the market irrational like this in a long time. I know how it ends though that’s why I don’t care.
Damn, shop around maybe.  My kid needed the works and it was only $3500, I don't think insurance paid for much at all.
Some guy did a DD on WOLF a week or 2 ago. He sounded smart so I bought some shares when it was around $87 but couldn't bring myself to grab calls. Full of regret right now.
Isn't any D faggy?
If you want to get rich, buy LC calls at open. It will start rallying like UPST.

Real talk: Canada has Chad-level monetary and fiscal policy. 

In 2002, Paul Martin (former Fin minister) took a look at "innovative" derivatives products, CDOs, swaps, etc, and said "but this is all fraudulent. No, please."

And thats why the great recession only hit Canada via global effects. He got made the Prime Minister, but was quickly dumped for being boring. Boring enough to look at derivatives math. That's *my* kind of boring.
Bet she’s got an innie
LC is really undervalued. Revenue more than UPST but 1/10th market value of UPST. Hold your calls. It should go to 40 tmrw.
Interesting... Didn't know of it. I love their site. They've made maybe a commission on me once. Is referral links a model that will survive with a public company, or will they become even more "pay to play" and just become a shill for the biggest spender of the month. If they start chasing quarterlies, they'll just recommend whatever shitty ass company pays the most, I'll stop going to them, and they'll die like so many PC websites.
I lost so much money today

Welllll, that vacationlover1 misfit is also perplexingly liked by some around here, so maybe.
It's flying right now my dude
The market clearly had different estimates than the official ones.
WTF F!
Big same here. I've been bleeding by huge amounts this month, and some of my misses would have been wins if I held longer, or accepted 20% as a good profit. Reduced my plays to 1-3 high confidence plays with the resolution to not get bucked if things go against me one day. Zoom out.

e.g., UPST puts went 10k against me this morning, but high confidence they're in a multi day slide to around 280-90. At close I'm back to green.
Oof. thats rough buddy. +5% after hours

A few more minutes until I lose my ban bet on TSLA. I was wrong two weeks ago. However, I have long dated $1000 puts I grabbed yesterday at $1070 that are up 10%. I'll ride the retrace and cash out. Good luck retards.

Social media is on such a fucking sale right now it's stupid. And my spare capital is in DWAC, which is what it is, but I wish I could focus more on portfolio building than trades right now. Fuck.
Yeah, those calls are gon a print.

Rent the runway got me hardddd
I don’t really care.  My emotions are tied to spy and I feel like ranting right now.  Thanks for the info though.  The gains might not hold until tomorrow anyway.
Genuinely confused at how TDOC dumps before the earnings call even starts? I have no stake, just curious….?
One is the spy and one is shit and piss
Why did they just spike AH like that
Worries about BNPL competition?

What do you mean? They beat earnings and raised guidance.

Congratulations F boys
Anyone know why V and MA didn’t spike? They best earnings on all metrics and upgrades guidance and upgrades their dividend. V did at least not sure MA did.
Facebook is oversold to hell
All those rocket emojis in the earnings topic for TDOC exploded
They beat.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I did because I’m a retard, bought some and 15 seconds later I lost 20% of my portfolio. Crude oil is where it’s at now
What pisses me off is that right now, there’s a ticker beginning a 30-day 100-150% gain. And I won’t hear about it until first week of December
I also bought calls right before market close
it's just sad watching a good company like TDOC get absolutely butchered by the market. FB misses revenue - goes up AH, TDOC beats revenue for the first time in 2 years and has 80% YoY growth - stock is down 5 % XD
😂😂 i should be down like 50% on my tesla puts but the iv is literally making me money
They are out..?
I know how to buy wish, and SPY puts. Thanks though!
Bruh
If you're talking about Puts even those aren't very attractive, stock is dead
fuck you Kathy for telling me about TDOC
Well I sold a CC at $16 strike, so prob gonna have to buy that one back.
Wtf happened to visa?
Made $11,000 Monday Tuesday. Withdrew $7500 and lost 80% of the remaining $3,500 today. Thank god I paid myself first
Bro Me too. I yolod my whole portfolio on spy calls in order to earn back what I had lost when I put in half of my portfolio on spy calls. I truly am at home with these people

They've figured out how to make more money selling less cars.

SPY CALLS TOMORROW!!!
FIRST
All these companies racing to build something no one really wants. An airline that doesn't treat their customers like enemies with planes that don't fall out of the sky is all we really need.

Sure, some locations on earth need vtol, but seriously, I'm not even driving to work anymore, much less flying in a Jetsons car with a bunch of fellow dumbasses sky-raging all over the place.
I’ve lost my confidence in my plays, so lately even when I’m in a winning trade I get shaken out when it moves against me. Need a win to get it back. Catch 22. Gotta be very careful about my next few trades
F earnings arent even out yet lmao they setting up a massive bull trap

Edit: this came through a lot later than earnings release. My bad.
Imagine not understanding deep OTM calls
People in here buying Tesla at a 350 p/e also saying baba is not a buy at 17 p/e is the most hilarious thing I’ve ever seen tbh and They likely will never “get it”. I hate to say it but some of you are legit going to get financially ruined by next year. Daddy loves you but some of you only learn things the hard way. When you see people on TV telling you to buy NVDA at 80 p/e but to sell TSM (the company the entire chip/semi industry relies on) with a p/e only in the 20s there’s definitely some ripe bullshit going on.
pRiCeD iN 🥴

Not really but you started it so I figured I'd engage.

How does it feel to work at the dumpster behind your local Wendy's?
Calm down bruh, fake ass pump chill your titties
No, they never lost. The price was stolen from them, and they are holding a rally in January to protest it.
Just noticed weird SPY bid/ask volumes were repeating in the dump hour:   
249/349  
449/549  
649/1049

Decent to good numbers. Sales growth slowing down is a worrying sign especially since the market is penalizing the stock heavily.
Tesla Shmesla, Ford was the play all along. Built Tough.
AMC  looking like a juicy value before the upcoming quarter.
True, maybe 15-20% stop lossand pray for a pump. They smashed earnqings and raised guidance tho so I'm hopeful
I am well up over %100 in the past week solely on calls my guy. You wanna have a cock measuring contest or what? Watch your mouth!

SIR pump and dump HAHAHAHA 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Just saw my unborn son on the sonogram for the first time and all I could think about were my Visa calls
COINBASE just shut down due to "error"... LMFAO!
VSCO may be divorced from market-pricing. They launched the ticker and hype, Citidel's long report, and thin-air sourced PTs caused it to rocket.

Sales and revenue had nothing to do with its recent rise and fall, so I wouldn't expect that rise to happen again without the hype and novelty. Feels SPAC-Y.
Wow F hasnt seen these levels since...*checks notes* 5 days ago.
God I hope so. I doubled down on 460 calls that exp 11/3
Still,not profitable. Also they didn't demolish anything.
Jerk off to my F gains.
eBay - I’m fuked
No one does that.
UPWK client base growth and revenue growth drops = bye bye
Bought F calls on the cheap, if analysts decide to come out in mass tomorrow and raise targets I'm going to make back a significant portion of this month's losses.

Todays sell off got ppl 👀. Futures will be red

If it can dump 3 dollars in 2 hours, there’s no reason it can’t go up 5 dollars in the next 2 days.

Obviously it won’t, but it absolutely could.
Ford Red by open

Do you think it will catch up, or do you think it is broken?
That’s when it happens

who lost money on spy puts today, you're home now
Ford pumped. EBAY dumped. Balanced. As all things should be.
I have a hanful of calls set for earnings tomorrow morning. 

https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/10/27/1049638567/cigarette-sales-increase-smoking-pandemic

This should signal a decent boost and most analyst are calling for a beat. Im hoping the beat exceeds expectations, not by a ton but there should be some money to make. I am holding some oct 29 47.5 and 48. also holding leaps at 47 and 52.50. Bought more today than I initially planned considering the 1.5% drop the day before earnings. Feel free to join me, I have a pretty bad track record.
Seemed like the obvious play was a SPY put, so I instead went SPY calls at bell.

It's so crazy it just might work...
F is Fing Flying. Only 1000/share to go to catch up to TSLA.

Guaranteed. Can’t go tits up
Ah yes, the first time I didn’t buy ford calls it goes up
PROG stock locked and loaded. 🚀💎
careful, F is absolutely allergic to staying above 16.5
If tdoc dropped to $105-110 i'd probably start buying some.
EBAY did beat aswell, just slighty but I guess my puts are dead tomorrow at open :( SADGE
Bought TQQQ at the top today!
AMZN 4k.

This is  what we need to increase EV adoption, STANDARDIZATION of charging stations. 

 General Motors Co. will use its dealership network to deploy up to 40,000 electric vehicle chargers across the U.S. and Canada, as the veteran automaker ramps up its shift to plug-in models. Starting next year, GM will give each dealer up to 10 Ultium-branded chargers to install in their communities. The chargers will be available for use by all EV drivers, not just those who buy a GM model. The effort will help deploy public charging stations in rural areas and underserved urban neighborhoods, the automaker said Tuesday in a release.
Standards are so low for Ford these days that "staving off implosion" is seen as a good thing by the markets
F
Oh shit didn’t even realize we have GDP and jobless tomorrow morning then AAPL and AMZN earnings AH. QQQ bout to smash through the stratosphere.
WHAT THE FUCK TWLO
TDOC demolished estimates, humongous YoY growth, so naturally it's cratering.

Are BB 10p guaranteed to print over the next couple of weeks?
Thanks for letting us know, how would I have known without you telling us.
Baba is a great long term play. They will be doing half a trillion a year by 2030, 33% of that is earnings. Not hard to see why smart money has been accumulating. 165 billion a year earnings at 25 p/e would be 1600-1700 a share. Bear case is 1200. Good luck
It’s at the end of the earnings week. The only reasonable way is down.
FORD U FUCK GO DOWN
Today was not a good day.
F absolutely soaring. Damn you really do need to inverse WSB
$GM did the same thing. Beat expectations then said they suck and stock dropped 5%
double inverse hammer into pikachu ears means it will trade sideways

Should have taken some profit. Now, my profit was cut in half.

&gt; I'm not sure if BABA is a good idea.
Man Sara Eisen is such a babe
I think we bounce off 453 and go back to ATH, maybe all in 1 day. But what do I know🤷🏼‍♀️ seriously idk
I've mostly gotten burned when I hold overnight. I have to day-trade them on the swings with 1-2DTE. High Risk but I've had pretty good luck with them.
gonna get drunk and watch apocalypse now
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/partially__derived (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 800.0 when it was 865.19 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Ford!! My baby, we did it Ford!
Could be, but also could not be
Thinking of buying BABA. Not sure if I'm ready to be hurt again.
Never go fully

I got merc’d at close today. Hopefully we rip face tomorrow!

Tomorrow AMZN earnings! Will it finally start it's run up to $4k? We will see.

Gettin cucked by Ford right now. An appetizer of things to come?
I am thinking people are taking profits, but I'm holding puts soo... Tesla gained $3 over the day from premarket, not too encouraging.
My puts are up 17% today. Down 70% since I bought them, but up 17% today.

VIX didn't make a new low while SPY makes an ATH. Who's lying here...
Insert 'so far' meme
It’s crazy how you hold for 5 Green Day’s slowly climbing up and than one red can really fuck you in the ass

Except the ones that didn't.  :(
More MSFT calls
are my amd calls for 11/5,11/12, and 11/19 safe?
Almost bought calls but were too expensive and too much of a % of my portfolio for my broke ass. idk if they would've been anymore than a quick doubler too, which is too small for an earnings gamble
$PALE
I pussied out and didn’t even buy 1
Embarrassing
Nice volatile day. I bought some SPY calls at close, so we'll see how it goes.
Like my irritable bowel syndrome
Closing Bell was way better with Maria Bartiromo. Zoomers will never know
slow boil deez nuts on your forehead
Was playing TFT and forgot to sell LOL. Hit 1st with a galio 3 though so that was cool. But unless AMD and TSLA climb up tomorrow I'm pretty boned. Already down 75% on 130c and 1100c. The past two days have taught me sell my shit before 730 and I can scalp something back.
I guess it's time to dust up that resume and look for some software engineering jobs.

Up nearly 40k on SPY puts over the last two days... absolutely saving me after losing 30k a month ago. Finally back positive.
&gt; You are correct. The 9 P/E is not that bad, but the fact that INTC has been in a downtrend for 2 years and there's no end in sight makes this stock look like shit to me.
guys look at FUBO. It’s heading back down to $25. GET FUBO PUTS. Check out the chart.
13 falls in the range of or so.
There’s always a new ATH
CLOSING BELL!!! 🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔

On the plus side, we’ll all be trillionaires soon.
Imagine  buying SPY calls at 2:25 then it   like *haha jk red close mf*
Skynet wins again.
It is really over. 
Look at the big picture, today's situation was very bullish, with the DXY low and 10 year dropping 5%. Yet we still dropped $3 when the real volume came in at the end of the day. Everyone wants out.

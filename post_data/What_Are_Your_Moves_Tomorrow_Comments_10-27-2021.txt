fuck the state, indeed
Agreed it’s kinda a “don’t need” at the moment. I imagine in the next year or two they’ll continue to drop in price due to wider adoption into the mainstream.
sounds good. i will keep on selling covered calls meanwhile
Dude ..
$1800 is great deal for the 65. About what I paid too. OLED is noticeably better. Made me enjoy watching tv/movies more. But if u don’t need it, don’t buy it.
Fire was discovered, not invented. Anyway, ancient microwaves.
OCGN buy the dip, don’t be a 🏳️‍🌈🐻
Yeah, you should panic.
TLDR: Fuck government
This was too long so I didn't read it
we weren't humans before inventing fire
Go ahead and panic. Hopefully papa hears us!
You just put my balls in a vice and popped it mister. Ohhh the lingering pain!
Let's say you draw a picture. It's a really nice picture. Everybody loves it. Then suddenly a lot of people say they want to buy it and are willing to pay $1b. Congrats, you are now a billionaire because you own an asset worth $1b. You don't want to sell your painting. You want to hang it up on your wall and hand it down to your kids. It's yours, why the fuck should you? But wait, the government says that because you're worth so much money, that you should sell your painting and give them some of the money from it. Why should you now be forced to sell your painting and relinquish ownership of it when you don't want to?
It's a green and glowing kind of morning. Perfect day for yellow cake. I'm feeling positively RAD.

Our*
Sell?
It was long term, but still hurts!
saying "we" here should be an instaban, change my mind.
A lot of them are doing buybacks to keep going. I'm almost certain there was deferred revenue in there as well.
We’re u trying to get a quick sale after ER thinking it’ll pop ? Or did u put your money long term?   

If short term then yea sell cc to make some profit so you can break even and get out even maybe a smaller loss.  

If you went long term then, it’s a buying opportunity if you can find some cash.  Or by selling cc and buying more stock at a lower price to average down.  

If you don’t want to sell for a loss then just hold for a while.  It’ll pick back up.  The hedges like this company and they will prob it up I’m sure.
That way he always cums out on top.

So play this out:

Elon needs $40B cash.

He sells 40m shares of TSLA (4% of company)

Stock starts to sell-off on volume and insider sales alerts. 

Retail takes the real hit.

Pelosi takes a huge hit. 

Earnings plays would now have to factor in Elon’s forced tax sales for share price.

E.G. - “Tesla made $1b profit this quarter, which means The stock will go up 5%. But Elon will have to sell to pay taxes on his 5% gains, which will drop the price 7%...”

Elon is now worth less by making more.

My favorite news headline FUD against the lower and middle class recently was “businesses fight higher costs” followed by a write up by business insider about wage pressures and blaming lazy workers and people not applying. 

Then you look at the financial statements of these businesses and they are netting billions in profits but yet they are “fighting higher costs” as if it’s unfathomable that they pay workers more. Won’t someone think of the executives?

It effects you if you own Tesla or Amazon.  Founders will be forced to sell to pay taxes on their unrealized gains.  That will make big price runs even harder, and the founders who got shit done will be selling control of the company to people that would not have made them great.  That is the biggest danger.  Control of these big companies can be wrested from those who built them.

Pay attention to HOOD. The company issued an enchantingly disastrous report yesterday. Everything was bad, from weak revenues, which fell sharply compared to the previous quarter, to losses of more than a billion. At the same time, the number of active accounts, active users decreased, and the average revenue per user fell. In general, everything was bad, but the company's shares are still prohibitively expensive.Puts on HOOD is the game for today

Damn. Blake Moore had 10/15 TSLA 510 and 500p bought in August.
Ehh, not the worst day I guess
Oh I'm sure GNRC will be getting into some infrastructure money here soon
Should I have bought more SPY puts yesterday?
*unzip* boi, this ain’t your lucky day, is it? I hope you like man-onnaise
Unvaccinated over 60's in Russia have been told to lockdown for four months
Why?
I haven't yet, but that's because (like you said) there's a delay. I'm seeing all these trusts and boomer old money accounts, but sprinkled in are options players, short sellers (especially during the covid crash) and some really well made trades that makes you wonder how they've got such a good intuition.
Lucky most of us aren't ideological crusaders fighting against "big hedgie" from our basements, i'll buy anything if it makes me money.

Start an LLC. Call it Vault Capital or something. 

Get a loan for 3 million. Payment at 5% interest for a 15 year loan is about 24k a month, or 288k a year. 

 Now you take that 3 mil, get portfolio margin, now you’re borrowing 15 million. Sell SPX box spreads so you’re not paying margin interest. 

Buy 15 mil worth of QYLD. That’ll get you about 1.5 million in dividends. Minus the ≈300k in loan payments, and there’s your 1.2 million. 

Where’s the 50k come in? Well that’s what you use to bribe a loan officer to ramrod the loan through for you.

Top is in unless we un-taper

It’s not priced in!!

Bears forever!
TWTR or MSFT puts?
It would have to be a pretty big drop in the main coins for it to have a decent impact, plus SPY’s currently trickling downwards so we’ll see.
does this count as a dip for tsla or no
Do you follow any trades or just see how well they have done? Yah usually we about 45 days too late..
So my 124 call is fucked. Great
Doesn't lead to the article
I could never buy that company after they fucked over half the people on this sub.  Hope they go to zero.

He probably won't be reporting until November or December. Sometimes they report quarterly, sometimes they fail to report. Check out Tom Malinowski. His reports are like 90% covering short positions. They're big reports since he got some heat for failing to report.
Earnings are weird that why i stay away even tho very tempting look at ups and Microsoft earnings
Coins down spy up

IV priced in ~8% move. So those who bought calls or puts yesterday requires a 8% move to break even lol
After all the sex and stuff.
Yep
Bought into Hood at closing bell at X2 leverage
Jesus. W need to know his next move
How
Just follow Tom Malinowski's trades. He's the bearish indicator, provided he actually reports his transactions.
Yesterday run up like crazy so yeah its normal
F
Ha! He never saw you cumming…
them sums of a bich
Down 21% before the day even started
I wonder how bad
We go to $1,400, candles are bullish. Tesla is bulish
shouldn't big moves in coin be good for them? both up and down?

is it LG?
&gt; They will tell us they sold at the top.
Why
Will the fed tell us they buying again before the rally?  Or do they only tell us they sold at the top 🤔
&gt; Spinning top.
So was TSLA 1d candle yesterday some kinda shooting star / spinning top and we go down or just a little breather on the way to 1200$?
Calm. It does
Have a feeling these GME calls about to buy me a new work truck today
Amd weeklies gonna be worthless at open

Have 235/245c weekly spreads on V. the spreads will most certainly be worthless at open anyway due to IV crush, so I'll hold them till expiry. Have some msft 312.5c weeklies so I got that going for me.
[deleted]
Itll prolly hit tbh, I'm in 456 for the same expi
Need NVDA to hit 253 already
Ok
Priced in, efficiently
Cool. Hopefully it bounces up a bit so my 35p are safe. But we’ll below my 185c.
James R. Langevin has been buying calls all year. I've been looking through congressional filings, and it seems like his last one was a good pick. 11/19 GNRC 400c when it was at about 408. It's at 472.71 right now.
wtf nvda
Make sure to hold thru expiration for maximum tendies
Deff
I might buy far out of the money puts and just YOLO, I don't play options, but my conviction is high.
It would take less time to tell you which of us **DON'T** do blow.
It'll come back as soon as the next set of fed insiders sell at the top

I’m holding SPY puts and it should affect it quite a bit, so I’m happy.
$PROG
Prog !
16 mins
I did both. If it holds at 17 I’ll be good, but of course, the put premium will sky rocket. It can’t go as high as delta suggests though. 


15 p delta would suggest .2339 x 41 drop = 9.6, on top of the 2.45? To a premium of ~12? On a $15 strike? Crazy lol. 


Anyways we’ll see where the premiums land tmrw. I am not sure how to counter then dramatic rise in my short puts at 15, at 2.5ish.

There is no way it passes. Congress is one of the groups that it would affect the heaviest. It'd be like a snake eating it's own tail here.  I think it is more a red herring or decoy that can focus people's attention on and have them be glad with congress that it got taken out of the final bill.

Yeah I do, I actually only sell cash secured puts (or covered calls if I'm playing the other side). I don't like to mess with margin accounts

I hate green futures, so hard to sleep. Red makes it easy on the eyes, green is too bright; plus sitting there and imaging how fat my calls will get means my mind is always racing.

Apple iPhone 13 pro, or galaxy z fold?
I prob use HBO Max and Apple TV the most, followed by Netflix and Hulu.  Prime is cool to buy movies on that are hard to find elsewhere but their free streaming content is nothing special.
Shhh this will fuck up their trade even more 😂

I had bought some calls but was pretty disappointed with the after hours volume and price. Hoping for the same thing

Well if I were to get out of the put by buying back, I would definitely have to do that for a loss. After hours, it's trading at $36.2, and who knows how much more it will drop tomorrow and the upcoming days. Earnings results were horrible

At this point, I think I will just wait. I'll most likely get assigned shares though

How TF did I miss this
Yeah, could be what I need. Problem is I got 2 young kids at home so my hobbies are mostly just stuff I can do from the house. Sportsbetting, the fun folio, and a touch of video games. The sports betting isn't really much for dopamine because I just do model based betting and EV bets/arbs mostly from promos/boosts. So once again making money on that, but not much thrill there either. As for golf I do enjoy playing a few times a year as well as disc golf almost weekly but here in the midwest it's getting fucking cold out already and not a fan of the outdoors when it's cold. Might just be getting depressed that the weather is turning back to the time of year I hate and it's dragging the fun I have with other shit down with it. Used to do bowling league 1-2 nights a week with friends and that made the fall/winter go a lot quicker. Don't really have that type of guys night out hobby any more with all of us having young kids.

Again, it’s in the PowerPoint. Slide 6/7

They showed ADAS-cog decline 57% slower at p=.02.  That’s a gold standard test. It’s like a memory weighted iq test. 

For null hypothesis generally, slide 7, they crushed all tests except for adas-daily living. The medicine definitely improves cognition if you are pg positive across a variety of dimensions (it’s actually that pg reduction was shown, but that’s the action of the medication). But those indications robustly show the drug is impacting disease broadly. Daily living almost significant at 48 weeks. 

They speculated that daily living which asks questions like ‘did you go to a grocery store this month’ got extra fucked up because they started the trial pre pandemic and ended during pandemic, so a lot of the measures got super noisy where everyone showed big decline. also, lowered activity in general from pandemic will further crush those so you’d expect a cog test out performance

It’s cool that you’re trying to cherry pick information in a feeble attempt to lighten your bags but even a cursory google search and ten minutes of reading show inconsistencies in your arguments and a complete lack of understanding of the medical background of Alzheimer’s and statistical analysis at large.

You a cop?
Huh. I always thought you were gay.
Serious advice:

Casually ask.

"Retardette, if you had a choice, would you prefer to get coffee or dinner?"

If she looks uncomfortable, own it and say, "That was a weird way to ask you out, huh?"

If she still looks uncomfortable, tell her that you didn't mean her any disrespect.

Still looks uncomfortable, apologize and go on about your day.

But if it's light hearted and she picks one of the choices, follow with, "Great, are you available at {time} on {day}?" You have to be specific. Don't be half assed. Have specific options at specific times. If she's not available because she's busy with something else, offer 1 other time option. If she's still unavailable, give her your phone number and tell her to let you know when she's available.

Be charming, be interesting, be confident, read her body language. Listen to what she has to say and work off that.

Happy banging.

Edit: Also pay for the date. Don't let her split the bill. Don't act like you're poor. Act like you spend your money wisely.
Always has been.

Tough to say, but TSLA feels like the "safer" play. It's got that autistic strength to it and I think another post mentioned about an analyst going on air at 7am tomorrow for a price update. 

Otherwise, could see how the market plays out at open and go from there. Either way, best of luck to both of us &lt;3
Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

How do you prevent yourself from getting bored with the market without yoloing more than 25% of your portfolio into dumb shit?

the group that was positive for the bacteria (left column on 6) had very good results on cognition, one of the primary endpoints.

Slide 7 isn't a test of efficacy over X at P&lt;0.05, it's instead "is there a positive effect and not just noise?), so you see very compelling p values. Shows that broadly it helped.  So 7 is an easier test to pass. But implies a larger sample might work.

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553)
Talk to her and see if you have any shared interests. Build camaraderie based on that. Ask her about work. Why is she in the class? Those are good places to start.
For every dollar of revenue HOOD brought in last quarter, [they lost $4.69](https://i.imgur.com/UL5jAYw.png)
At this point she has some or zero interest and you won’t find out without asking her. There’s nothing you’re going to do in the few minutes that you get to talk to her to convince her differently so just shoot your shot. Oh and do it at the end of classes in five weeks so you don’t have to awkwardly sit next to her if she declines.

Bros, I need actual advice about this girl.

I sit next to her in class and I'm totally crushing on her hard. IDK how she feels about me tbh, the signs are very modest. She has laughed at a joke or two and VERY lightly touched my arm while doing so. Other than that, just acts normally like acquaintances.


She leaves right after because of work, so I feel that it'd be a little tricky to talk to her after class right now. We have 5 weeks left of class, but I still haven't gotten her number yet 😑

GigaChads of WSB, how do I approach this and get the victory royale (a date)?

Edit: Will ask her out. Thank you dudes, it helps to have someone else say it eventhough the answer's obvious.

I like the secret messages at Whiz Burger
posted about CRTX. Lost in all the shitting on it is that for people who actually have the bacteria it's treating (which they think causes Alzheimer's), there was considerable improvement - 57% reduction in rate of decline for the high dose group. Has not happened in an alzheimer's phase 3 trial before. Selling off 70% does not make sense since they have a plausible path to a drug that would still make the company worth many billions.

This also means that they just proved a bacteria causes and/or accelerates alzheimer's disease. That's big news as well. And they have a narrow spectrum antibiotic that does kill that bacteria (and nothing else).

I think you’ll be good tomorrow. Active user growth is stalling and while they are saying they didn’t take as big a hit from apple privacy, they still lowered guidance for Q4 and any pullback on growth should put downward pressure on this stock.

Math. Two recent moves went up to the 50% retracement, and the 61% retracement, respectively. These retracement lines have been vital to PLTR, for months and months now. If this pattern holds and the next move goes to the next retracement line, that’s 36

its in the powerpoint. For people that tested positive to the bacteria, the high dose group had a 57% reduction in rate of decline, with statistical significance. That only makes sense if an antibiotic on the bacteria is relevant. that means the bacteria is causing or accelerating the disease in those patients. Slide 6/7

[https://ir.cortexyme.com/static-files/2025ddbf-00dd-4375-b8b8-c681a6f88336](https://ir.cortexyme.com/static-files/2025ddbf-00dd-4375-b8b8-c681a6f88336)

everyone is shitting all over them right now on the basis of liver tox (no one took liver damage, and it was mostly at 6 weeks according to mgmt), and endpoint failure.

But they just proved their disease theory, which everyone shit on before as impossible. And their drug actually reduced decline in the population where it makes sense it would work. Which hasn't happened before in a phase 3 AZ trial convincingly. When the performative twitterazi is done, you may see some institutional accumulation and analyst upgrades, or at least, buy maintains at prices far beyond $15.

Why can’t there be more days where SPY just goes in one direction slowly but surely all day long. Like it opens flat and then goes either up or down by 1.5% over the course of the day but with no bouncing around, just a straight line up and to the right or down and to the right. 

It would be so much easier. That’s the world I want to live in. And then after two weeks of that when everyone is complacent it goes completely haywire
Vettes are definitely cool. Sometimes there are some shitty people in the club, but damned if I haven’t had some fun in a few different gens.

I have 100 460 expiring 10/29 would be so sweet to see 460 end of day today
I beg to differ. It would matter, say it’s cars…if 3000 of the same car sell for the same price that’s the price. If only 3 cars sold for that price that’s just not enough sales volume to confidently say that that is the price. So if OP were to check the volume perhaps he would come to the same conclusion that the price doesn’t matter and maybe that would satisfy said curiosity.

crtx is a slam dunk buy if its at 15 again. The disease theory is now true. Before it was considered probably false. The drug works for people that have PG in saliva. That's a clear path to a phase 3 success or a sideways approval. Should not be down 70% on this. If they have an approval, even with a limited patient population (PG positive in saliva), that's still 40% of all alzheimer's patients, which means it's a 10b or 20b company in that case. That's 20 to 40x from current stock price.

Yolo on TSLA like a degenerate. Chart looks sketch but it’s gonna get spicy. Goldman Sachs upgrades usually hit different. Ron Baron on CNBC PM these were his comments in his Q3 parter letter: 

Tesla delivered 241,000 units in the period, a 73% increase over last year. And this growth is before new facilities open in Berlin and Texas and capacity upgrades are implemented in China and California. Consolidation of chemistry materials should enable battery production to outpace vehicle growth. This higher production should lead to the energy storage business becoming more impactful for the company over the coming years and provide even more upside for current shareholders. Tesla continues to present strong deliveries growth and a meaningful improvement in profitability despite a complex supply-chain environment.

So for holloween I'm thinking about taking a bottle of vodka, infusing it with mint and dying it green, and then pouring it into an empty Listerine bottle. I figure if I just drink straight out of the Listerine bottle and throw on some rags from good will then I can look just like a gay bear. Then all I have to do is go around and bitch about how stupid p/e ratios are and how much I hate Elon Musk.
Borrowing 3x to buy QQQ would theoretically cost a fixed interest rate to initiate the position, but assuming there's a drop and a recovery the position would remain fully intact whereas being long TQQQ would get chewed up as they reset the leverage daily, essentially locking in leveraged losses and starting from a reduced position on each down day. If it drops 10%, it needs an 11% rise to return to the starting point. Gets worse with larger drawdowns.
I have to go cash gang before I do something naughty

TLDR but upvoted for Winnie the Pooh reference
Don’t know, but so glad it did. Empowering women to be slutty is a win
The fact you called sexual positivity “whoring around” leads me to believe you are a boomer
I deserve $ROPE for holding $PINS. Sigh.
i think it's bad to not eat in the morning - just in general, you power your brain with available sugar first before going into fat so it's good to eat something sugary and fatty when you wake up, not just like "in the morning". Considering just that fact, I think you would be selling yourself a little short if you didn't power yourself up with some food in the morning. Just my thought of course.

It takes huge fields of coca to produce a few kilos of cocaine. That's why it's only produced in South America, and not in greenhouses in the US like weed is. It would take millions in infrastructure to make coke on Mars, and would be really hard to hide.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Qaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces.

Ur problem is trying to be special. Just build wealth. take that 20k, next time take that 3k, etc.

All profit is profit. U think amazon waits until workers tell them its fine to remove toilets? hell naw, they slowly chip away at costs to build a wealthy and 'strong' company. Eventually, workers piss in bottles and they saved $2dollars a workers/hr.

Use that line of thinking and you'd see that no company would say no to 20k profits. Cuz then they'd be out of business.

And if u trading to make money u gotta run it as a business.
Got it wrong there.

Nobody has yet studied how to produce cocaine on mars. It might not be possible. This creates a dilemma--do you make a bulk purchase of a lifetime supply of cocaine and transport it to Mars, or do you take the chance that you'll be unable to successfully cultivate and process the coca plant?

It's risky--if you take a "lifetime supply" of cocaine with you, it might tempt you to go over the edge into full 24/7 degenerate insanity, while living in an environment that requires extreme attention to detail and safety protocols in order to survive.
The curve inverted because the fed was forcing the front end of the curve up while everything past about 4 years was being bought by everyone. The fed needs to completely run out the balance sheet or it will do the same thing again. The curve needs to float based on demand or it's still just a fake and gay curve.
LOL. I would say inflation has zero effect on shit stocks. Shit stocks don't even need to have good earnings or good business and they can still fly or die.

When you see some one post the same comment you posted couple days ago 😐
Fun fact:

The yield curve inverted when the fed last raised rates in 2018. The market corrected then, but it didn't fully crash.

However, when the yield curve inverts the crash typically happens 12 to 18 months later... which the covid crash fell within.

Are you on drugs or something?

Emotions are like weights

The tinge of fear you feel when your portfolio goes red, that's like a 15lb dumbbell, so you examine it, curl it a bunch of times without letting it control you, and let it pass over you

And the next time fear comes knocking, you handle a little bit more weight each time

But, if you indulge it, and let the fear dictate your actions, you stay stuck at that little 15lber, wondering why things never seem to go your way

I think we're going to have to agree to disagree. Yes retail can start the catalyst but without the fund follow through, price wicks or comes back down. Just take MVST, SKLZ, CLOV, etc recently for an example. Funds are absolutely needed for sustaining any rallies. It seems like the funds chasing were just dropping bags on retail to push back down so that they can scale more into their positions. It might start organically but you need the follow through.

I think Pirate Bay’d a python textbook, went through that started projects and tutorials for more complex things online, built confidence and a little portfolio.

Wtf? This comment is so confusing. Why are you telling me I need to prep like I don't know this when my comment is about prepping? Did your brain shut down when you saw the word secure? Why does the word secure shut your brain down if you're into prepping? So many questions, not a single part of your comment makes sense
did you get any certifications or did you just show them you had experience ?
Calls ?

Sometimes only young portion passes with time
Disagree.  Retail daily market inflows increased 2x and 3x during the recent dip past month.  Rampant dip and call buying starts MM share buying call hedging which gets the algos going and the funds chasing.  It’s a big snowball, but retail was definitely a catalyst for this recent mkt bounce.
I'm just getting more and more pissed thinking about how much work it's going to be for me to get a reasonably secure vehicle in the US. Right now the best plan I can think of is getting a Tesla and reworking everything, replacing all the electronics and accessory systems and the doors with secure versions. That fucking sucks but other car companies have even worse physical security against collisions and that seems impossible to fix whereas patching up all the Tesla security holes is just extremely difficult rather than impossible. I hate people so fucking much for making it so goddamn difficult to just transport myself between locations on the planet reasonably safely
Inflation is high. Stop buying shit.

Yea man, you can look through my comment history. I never shill any of my positions. I just shitpost on here to pass the time. Whenever I tried to post anything on the daily threads to spark a discussion, it never got any traction. Which is why I just shitpost. There are still alot of smart users here that I think can contribute a lot to the discussions, but most are just shitposting like myself. Also the shilling and seeing tards get fucked holding institutions bags is pretty sad which is why i commented about it.

Yeah they're good. They have a trading platform called think or swim (tos) which ties to your account.  Might be the best trading platform around though it is not super user friendly. It will give you the most detailed picture of options performance anywhere. I use tastyworks which is a good alternative. They hand out high options privileges to everyone which can be profitable when you are knowledgeable.
Hopefully it’s the higher end
Fee fees?

Idk, I guess it was different. Less people so you couldn’t be as obviously retarded. But hey, its Capitalism. If you can’t weed out a shill, or scam for yourself. Get fucked.

did it happen with GME ? lol.
I don’t think they have the pull that some of the more culty stocks think they have

I’ve seen more paper plates in the last two months than I think I’ve ever seen at any stint, a bit ridiculous

The GME ER run up started today 🚀🚀🚀🌕
I can't read. More pictures
During GME they were saying that.  "Call your brokers and tell them not to lend out your shares"

Ok sure, your 2 shares really swung that price.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
BA doesn't go below $200 anymore. if it does i'm fukt
Yeah you’re good. It’s safer to overcompensate and go around a 35% IV loss for after earnings in case it doesn’t move too much, but IV crush shouldn’t be too bad if you sell early and with how big of a move it was (as long as it stays or goes down more before open).
Is it illegal to buy and sell the same stock through two different brokers?
Someone tell me a stock to buy. I need to gamble.
hey but at least you got the flair, amiright

Tomorrow others will report on it.
Omg. I'm going in. I don't know who is gonna come back out. Love ya guys.
No way to know but today we got a shooting star reversal signal. Needs to confirm by closing under todays low. Last week I called Oct 27-Nov 4 as red
Those 11/19 35s are probably gonna end up printing

They added $5 puts to the option chain 🤣
I'd rather hold AMC as a just-in-case

It's gonna do a lot of nothing. It's fat and lazy now.
This is pure uncut QAnon stock cult fix you need. [https://imgur.com/a/TDDyX9n](https://imgur.com/a/TDDyX9n)
just one more food for thought and then i will go back to shitposting. Institutions have way more capital than all of retail. For argument's sake, let's say that participating retail total capital for one stock is greater than the few participating institutional funds' capital. 

&amp;nbsp;

Where retail get absolutely hosed is their capital flow is dynamic and way too chaotic. You have ppl selling while others are buying at different times and prices. On the other hand, the funds are dropping coordinated buy and sell blocks. You can't compete with that unless retail become an entity with coordinated actions and interest. And guess what that shit is a felony so the odds are stacked against us. 

&amp;nbsp;

This ain't absolute because funds are also competing with each other. So really best we can do just ride along in their wake in the direction we bet
No
that's true. but the volume is nothing no? I haven't actually looked IRL.
The train came and went man. I had 2 shares back in January in at 112. Got out in Sept when it was 199.99.

Losing money sucks and all, but dumping TSLA 960c 11/5 for $650 on 10/21 cut me to the fucking core today. Why do I only diamond hand garbage plays?

Nah he was wrong. The better advise was to sell 3 shares 50% above the standard price.

Just had my first call on the “Be my eyes” app. It’s basically blind people video calling you and asking you to help them with stuff. [Crazy ratio](https://i.imgur.com/ZAZR3rU.jpg) so it took a very very long time (years). Helped a dude find his lunch and read the back of the box for him.

🥭 gonna see if he can one up his flopped businesses with flopped SPACs
Pretty sure if it holds +50% in a day moves it to meme tier.
and it closed lower than yesterday’s close. this looks extremely short term bearish, a pop with no follow through is not a good sign. you’re probably right, 940 would be next to see
Love ya WSB, lotsa crazy, good people, I wish ya the best ❤️💛💚 bottoms up biichzz
It doesn’t need to with a mountain of free toppings!
IVY + patent sale are two massive catalysts this quarter
&gt; I'm not sure.
It sounds like it was profit, don’t chase since now it’s emotions… or maybe toss a call in for funsies
So glad i didnt buy back my ocgn and lucid calls today...sure enough 2 hrs later, the premium tanked like 5x. Whew
Best comment I’ve read today
Sometimes they do. Depends on the quality and content of the research they put out and if it gets picked up in the press and on the street.
Evergrande got those debt collection bills right where it wants them
I was going to say…damn man I really must not know what I’m doing lol. (I don’t but I think I have the IV crush math figured out for the most part)
Is Asian snartch any better than your run of the mill?

I just buy and hold it. They pay me money at a nice rate for doing that. The price has been going upcCs are ok. Has been really nice actually and I don’t worry about ER much.

And I bought a few puts to play the implosion coming. I have shares in my long account. A run-up like this is due for a minor correction. It might not happen but its worth the risk IMO to play it

Wait I’m a fucking idiot, read it as 36p. You’re good lol. Should see around a 100% gain at least with significant IV crush taken into account if it opens near what it closed based on OPC.

Probably lol but he has a shit ton of shares and I’m pretty sure he sells more than covered calls
Just came here to see if stocks are still going up
This comment when GME was $20 was what made me buy in
You can't open new positions. I believe you are still able to close existing positions.
Before I pass away, I just want BB to moon to 25 one final time.
Duck tails was good, but danger mouse and count duckular were the best
this isn't my first account but if you were here back then you know what i'm talking about. there wasn't as much shilling and so you could actually have intelligent discourses and bounce ideas. Rest were just shitposting and ragging on each other. A lot more self-deprecating humor

Yes. It stopped at 1000 on the dot and nearly hit up to 1050 after.

If this was all fake it would have dumped to 940 atleast
If you're here and not holding at least some GME as a just in case those crazy bastards are right than what the fuck are you even doing.
I got puts near to close, the thing about SPY puts is it always seems you have to get out pretty quickly.
PLD means Poor Life Decision. I make them all the fukin time. Maybe I put some money into PLD and see what happens.  Never thought to look and see if there was a ticker for it
I already have puts, I also have shares in my long account. I like TSLA I just think its going down in the short term
Willing to eat a dog turd if it does?
If I had six months to live it would be fun to see if I could do something like that and make my friends and family rich. If I lost it all, who cares.

No.
It's just been my experience for the past 15 years. Lol
So don't ever buy puts then. And cry when it pulls back.
I think you’ll likely profit but after IV crush and theta it’s not going to be amazing if HOOD opens near what it closed. I recommend setting at least a partial sell order based on what it’s at in pre and going off OPC so you don’t get completely rattled.

U really wanna see my plays?
Did you hear their price target for holding 145 bags?
TSLA has serious tard strength, that's the only thing holding it up right now in my opinion. TSLA has no floor or resistance it just fucks its way through the market and hopefully you are on the right side when you decide to go in

new flash for those just joining us. retail absolutely does not matter. one time it did was gme and that's when it was a GLOBAL phenomenon. Ppl were piling in from everywhere and even then it was institutions that were pushing those big moves. Retail order flow just allowed institutions to scale out at higher price levels.

So just stop shilling, it's embarrassing. This place is for gambling addicts to air out grievances for their mistakes a la old wsb. When there's no institution sponsorships, you get those gnarly wicks with no follow throughs with retail just fucking over each other.

Probably a good plan. Don’t intend on holding til earnings. Whenever PLTR spikes like it did today it usually crashes down right after. I may even buy some calls when it happens.

Dang, the 1yr Target est is $98.95, and it's currently 68.65. Yahoo Finance seems to rate the mid term and long term as red down arrows, though. Wonder why. I might buy some AMD tomorrow morning, but this does sound pretty enticing as well.

V options sound like a bad time.
Imagine being the Tesla stockholder converted by the stock cultists before the epic run these last few weeks. That's why the stock cults suck. The run alone is multiples of that stocks entire value.

Down tomorrow, then up forever
Go ahead, buy puts on tesla. I’ll fucking laugh.

I mean, I agree, but the Americans still go to McDonald’s unironically.
I have had a wild ride since jan joining WSB, actually writing a journal of all my trades. Gone from $45k to $22k to $330k back down to $45k over a span of 3 months and now I’m back at $200k in a month. I think I need to chill 😂 but also I’m learning so much along the way and finally getting pretty good. Staying away from options unless I’m 100% confident. Anyways, to answer your question, I got $50k in IRA and a good job at $115k a year to fall back on so I’ll be grinding until I hit 1M+ or we enter a major bear market
Could you actually sell them for 100000%? I doubt there was any volume
Happened to me because of 4 day trades
Best of luck!
I have a shit ton of MSFT and V options. I have no idea what my account is going to open at tommorow.

You're probably right but I grabbed some calls anyway because I made 500% last earnings

Lol I hear ya. I’m not in yet. I been thinking about calls but it’s kind of high already. But then again $3775 is the ATH so far. It seems to tank after earnings though

what's actually happening is all asset classes are mechanically aligning their current price level to expectations of negative expected returns in a near-zero growth world. you'll only come out on top in equities if you time the escape right, otherwise you will get crushed the same as bond holders. except with much more volatility

Yeah I like your plan. Definitely not selling my shares. Hoping bigcoin goes to 80k before the end of the year while I’m holding these COIN December calls. But I also got some weeklies that I should’ve sold today at the high. Hopefully bigcoin rebounds tonight so COIN goes up another leg by Friday.

Up 50% on PROG calls today, it’s doing well AH.
They did say they were looking at growth in 2023 so someone knows about some good war engine sales coming down the line
Why did it jump 50%
and find one with a kid. then they wont want one from you
Watch SEDG tomorrow. Rival ENPH reported earnings tonight and is up 12% in AH. SEDG only up modestly.
AMD gonna gap up hard tomorrow. Surprised it didn’t dip after earnings
The play is before earnings

Robinhood shutting down
At 28 the most important thing is your earning power.  Are you making 200k a year?  That’s good at 28.  Or are you making 50k and you have 200k cash?  Aside from the freak market from the last 15 months, it’s hard to rapidly grow that 200k without risking it.  If you have high income and can continue to regularly save and invest a good amount, you’ll be in great shape by 40

Got a house before Covid hit, was down to $22k before memeville got me sucked in
doubtful. they're in a lot of trouble with supply chain issues. you can't even get any of their new products, all on backorder and they keep pushing the delivery date out.
Boomer bought $2m worth of BRK.A with a market order and ended up with 3 shares priced at 660k.

Down 33% right off the bat since the real price is 440k.

Your flair, anytime you post just rethink. Because your flair.
Too late for it imo. My calls were down 40% few week ago came back up and sold for like 450 break evenish. It was today up 1.5k. So, don't chase cuz the premiums already ran up. I wish I kept mine but I ain't buying em back so exp.

What are you trying to say? 10k in losses for stocks and 40k in gains for stocks?
Pause and think about this. You have videos from tictok on the front page of this sub screeching that the end is near. Yes retail does influence price movement but just like the pandemic, big money will get the fuck out if it’s senses danger.

Unlike the pandemic drop, the phenomenon these fucking bears are crying about is not unexpected. People have been talking about inflation for 3 years. They have been talking about corporate debt levels for 3 years.

how many quarterly earnings statements is that for the S&amp;P 500 alone? Where is the massive drop? 

Have any of you 🌈🐻 paused to think what you would do in a stagflation scenario? Do you know how Japanese investors have negotiated the last 30 years of their collective financial existence? Or is the train of thought here so insanely simple that 'stocks go down, I buy the dip'? 

Good luck timing that insanely difficult trade. I am completely with Gerber on this one. Whatever happens, I want to own shares of innovative, profitable companies. If the market goes down 30% over the next two months I still want to own equities. What else would I do? Savings accounts don’t pay anything, fuck Internet money, I’m not buying fucking Kroger stock for a dividend payment at the age of 30.

I’m sorry you don’t like the way the system is designed but you play the game that is in front of you and that game says buy equities
Okay
Still MRK calls. From now until 12/17. Huge amount of open interest at $82.50. 2-5x higher than any other stroke price/date, more than likely they are resulting from the FDA meeting 11/30 to discuss new antiviral covid drug and make a decision on approval. They also have earnings report on the 28th of this month that’s expected to be good, sold 50,000 units to France, are in discussions with several other nations, just started phase two of a new HIV long term drug today, etc. IV is low so options are still cheap but I believe this will pop very soon.
I like to have it playing in the background

Serious advice: look into cognitive behavioral therapy. Works extremely well for this type of thing. If no money, buy the book Feeling Great. Better with a good professional but the book is very good if you have the motivation and are an autodidact.

That’s all I can ask 🥲

I feel a number of red days upon us. The bears silently wait in the shadows of the forest. We are not safe.
I don't know why people would downvote you for saying the obvious.

But, personally? I don't consider +433% "dead" hype. My price target is still $40 though.
I’m thinking the same, loaded up on some crap

I absolutely will not be joining you lol. But good luck, hope you make a lot off the play!
Who you trying to convince
So I’m good for making a 5 figure day like once every six months. But In between that, I slowly bleed all my money away. So I’ve learned to take out everything when I hit big…I’m capable of turning $1000 into $10k. If I have 1,000-2,000 to throw around I’m happy
Too much horsing around
Oh absolutely. I want open robinhood and tell people loudly in public I'm checking out PORN.

GUH made 20k friday on CLF sold and rolled all the profits on QQQ puts. Shit went south yeserday got out at -70% and rolled it into LOGI and FB puts. Sold my FB puts at a loss and LOGI got me green. Yolo’d it on AMD calls.

Listen, just going to advise you to be careful.  You can probably snipe spikes like that but wait for the future spikes.

This is not likely to go back to 10 and stay there.  I expect  several more $40-70 moves in both directions rest of the way until it merges.

This is going to be a news driven stock.
For when? Tomorrow?

In honor of the poors in here who don’t have 25k I am going to yolo 25k on didi leaps. Didi Kong seems too memeable for the apes so I’m just gunna go with the flow and see what happens. I also feel like it’s a good bet with only a small chance of some fuck shit happening. Everyone else shitposts their stupid yolo plays in here so here’s one of mine. God speed fellow retards, also I’d like to order a baconator and a frosty to go. Extra cheese and of course some special sauce from out back.
So basically an ape sub
Shut the fuck up and go back to your sub
Or I’ll just keep buying puts because I enjoy watching gullible degenerate authoritarian fanboys getting fucked.
Fuck his Chinese Buffett and his country Buffett
I'm listening.....
Wow I’m going to lose so much money tomorrow
That sub was a glimpse into insanity. it's like the ticker is QANON. "There are signs everywhere. Price bottomed today at 56, we got robbed in the 11th month of last year, 56-11 = 45, and Donald Trump was the 45th president!"
I’m in MD and sports gambling isn’t legal yet so I use a VPN. DKNG is much easier if it’s legal in your state.
No. The stock goes to 0 now are you glad you bought shares instead of a call?
2032, maybe.

I’m short on everything and long on VIX and UVXY - either I’m a ret@rd savant or bankrupt - no one else see the iceberg?
FYI, VisualMod's a bot (I think LOL).
p.s. YouTube is not recommending Cramer to me

is Cramer still on CNBC?
The Dip was end of day under 1020
Anyone else think Warren has checked out his brokerage account and just laughed at the retard that bought today.
how do you guys bet on games? any recommendations for a site?
The 🥭 sub has become a copium den.
your two paragraphs seem to be saying different things
My word was “schlong”
Well maybe if the WHO didn't drag their feet, we wouldn't have needed to resort to such dramatic actions. /flips hair in sailor moon ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
They also have big gains right?

Holy shit though.. a woman ran under 63 minutes in the Half this weekend.

Hello.                     Hi.
‘Don’t say a prayer for PayPal save it for the morning after ‘ Duran Duran for-saw this moment
Microsoft is a beast. Praying for a PM profit take so I can get in
It did, but then was forced down. Market makers don't want the calls to print. We saw a similar dynamic last earnings, but the technical run on the stock was in a slightly better place. Now we have a situation where MMs saw a consistent run-up and have already delta hedged on calls expiring this week, so there was fuel to suppress... but tomorrow the earnings report and new guidance should result in institutional buy-in. We'll see, but last earnings day was a red candle, too... and then the next few days were just amazing.

Granted that one ran up more after hours, but AMD still climbed back up to over $125 AH before settling down today. There's buy in that pipe.

Not making a prediction, to be clear, just saying there's still reason for hope.
All good until some dipshit Price is Rights you and gets in there for $659,999

#SHRIMP GOOD AS A MOTHER FUCKA
As far as the Trump SPAC goes, just stay on the sidelines for now.  Let the price come back down a bit, let the option vol become reasonable, and then buy some calls in January before they announce the TRUTH Social network.

Stock will likely just be a meme around any sorts of announcements from them, so just play it off news events.
probably not real. msft doesn't do well post earnings usually....always returns to the trend line.
Ban. Perma-ban for saying shib too.
Jesus Christ. I leave for 2 weeks and the entire market blasts off to the Andromeda galaxy.

Glad I lost money and got out just before the gains hit. 🤡
Not being able to YOLO calls
Just a reminder:

If you have enough cash sitting around for 100 shares, it's better in every single way than a single fd call.

If you want to actually be rich, it's better in every single way to put all of that cash into those calls instead.
They get angry at him for a few days and then they forget abt it when it pumps a few weeks later
Where the CRTXtards at
Someone tried to meme it. It never fucking moves tho
Still a lot of gamma though  don’t see it under 1000 EOW.

Just selling them cookies alone, just imagine
wow. there is something I haven't heard in a while. I might buy a call
Alright MSFT is this pump real or are you going to FB me hard tomorrow
Someone posted it might have been a fat finger trade
It’s too obvious though so it won’t happen

Tesla 1150
Jokes on you. It was me! A man! Trying to get your tendiez
Why don’t you just use debit spreads? You are able to buy more contracts with less capital. You also don’t have to worry about IV crush.
Nice work. 60% of the week ahead of us still
In french they'd call you Le Retard

I’ve been riding these NCLH stocks for a year now
I got $500, what should I do with it?
Haha, $6k, no big moves until about a year ago. I came in serious right before gme. I was pretty tight during that and I don't regret it.
Zuck knows what's up.  There won't be a need for Tesla's where he's going.
iv crushed probably. shoulda got shares
Any chart technicians here? Several gaps have not been filled on this run up, expect a “ backtest”.
Damn I did? And honestly this would be a lot more fun if you played along. But it’s just me 😔
1100 again
This girl on tinder was using a fake name and covering her face in every picture.... yeah she's tryna cheat on her boyfriend for sure
I’m home right now
I got out of my vanilla calls and held a layered stack of ITM/ATM/far OTM debit call spreads with some debit put spreads as a hedge. Spreads handle the IV crush better and you can even get some weird arbitrage issues. I tend to buy my calls past breaks and sell calls at numbers divisible by 5 because those are usually resistance points... the 5s are also the most popular of the options... I.e. 131/135 spread.

You can end up in weird positions where the sold call can degrade more than the value left on the lower call. It's rare, but it can happen, resulting in a call spread that should not profitable... but is.
Dude look at what’s been happening to all the mega caps after earnings 📉📉📉 I would steer clear.
Will make a great trade if infrastructure passes

The kind of people who would be content with 12M$ are also the kind of people who will never make 12M$.
This is much too logical and practiced.
Hoping for both , starting with 900
I've been playing so many weeklies...I was down to $350  2 weeks ago but sq saved my ass and keeps saving my ass. I was at 1700 on Friday but lost $700 due to snap earnings...
imagine still thinking fundamentals are the reason why tsla will crash

didn't you get the memo loser? this stock is never going down
Tell that to my dad
shes a lawyer. too rich for you
Pornhub yolo ftw
Nah man, that's 85-90 tbh
YES
this doesn't make sense. why wouldn't you also entrust bird to take the last shot to save a game then?
this kind of gaslight is just sad to see. they need to stop fucking around with shares and go deep in fds. No hopium to grasp if all your shit just expires worthless. take the next step
If I had to pick one word to describe myself that word would be awesome

Snap is a decent stock but I wish they did more diversify the business.
Every security is the same thing with different risk profiles.

Bag holding is usually stupid because you could just sell and ride something else back up.

"Sell" and "something else" aren't even good terms for this. It's more "readjust holdings from downtrend to uptrend".
60% of American households below poverty line rn.

Solid disagree from me

Our parents were, we are not
Ppl who bet like you closed their positions
As far as I'm concerned, they deserve it. I've seen the same play quite a few times.
#OOOOHHHHHHHH
Live in a liberal state where rent is $2,000+ a month and your wage doesn’t compensate for cost of living with high taxes and you will understand starting out from college.
Just gotta control yourself once some plays don’t work out with options I’m kinda going the shares route  right now for long term plays will get back to options when everything settle down
Fuck the Astros man.
i see posters in their 40s here trying to make it big. like, whats the point? its all over.

CAT down 13% the last 6 months, bet it moons.
When’s the best time to sell Tesla ?
The worst case is definitely not consolidation, The chart looks like a penny stock pump and dump. It very well could be blood red and nobody would be suprised
Damn
How much did you banked from tesla
Can’t say that it’s patent pending
I'm okay. Just saw a huge spider in my office. Sad at how early it gets dark now. Think I'm starting to get a bit of seasonal depression. What are you stressed out about?
Anyone in prog ?
The fat chick said no Warren. What do I do now?
Ahh sweet
Ok
Asia slowing down and not much room in upside considering the P/E ratio it is trading at.
So it's got a long way to fall, got it
=) Good to hear. Take a vacation and get some R&amp;R.
I’m probably going to go back to 860 tomorrow if tesla doesn’t go up tomorrow haha
Worst case is it drops $150 as degens sell their dead calls back to the MMs who sold them and we roll off a huge amount of gamma

I bought like 16K of TSLA before earnings and it ended up paying off with like 18% in a week. I managed to sell today literally 20 cents from the top for a cool 4K in a week of trading days.

If only 1/3 of my trades were this good. This brought me back to about even on the year FFS.

I lost 14k back in march...I just deposited 1k back in August. I'm currently at 1200..

Yeah there’s a trade off as all things… what I like is the huge amount of premium bc my end goal is buying my contract back eventually not hold until 2024…. And second I love how low my break even is if I’m assigned. I don’t start losing money until Robinhood would drill to like 23

If you're feeling poor after your gambling losses, and jealous of billionaires, just remember one thing. Many of them don't use bidets and have to go through life with an inadequately cleaned anus. You, a moderate poor, can get a $30 bidet attachment and live life like a relative king or queen, giving you a heightened level of confidence in any social situation. #protips.
Thank you for clarifying I’ll remove you from my SEC complaint

^^^Ignore the fact that it hasn't profited in 5 years and doesn't have the cash on hand to survive till 2024^^^
Well, of course it's not. The product isn't out yet, as you said.

**Link #1:** The dealmaker has been involved with the financial industry for over eight years. It has also helped dozens of companies get listed; covering billions of deals. I don't see the issue here?

**Link #2:** "*\[Politifact\] The website found that* ***there is validity*** *to many of Trump’s points about business bankruptcy being in the best interests of companies.* ... *Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows a financially struggling business to reorganize in order to keep going. A Chapter 11 filing can potentially enable a business owner to avoid liquidating the company*."

So, they're defending his total of *four* filings (he owns over 500 businesses) as legit and reasonable. Again, what's the issue here?

**Link #3:** So, he lost $1b on his businesses over the course of nine years of 1985 to 1994? You know that was almost *thirty* years ago??

**Link #4:** Paywalled, so I know you didn't read this one either.

**Link #5:** Yes, branding is how all businesses make money. How is this a bad thing?

I don't expect you to respond to any of this, but the point is that you don't really seem to know what you're talking about. I think you're making a mistake.

All they do is lend money. SOFI has ton more business ventures. They’re about to be a freakin bank
My BRK.A calls gonna print hard tomorrow
Two weeks ago during the debt ceiling talks I lost 150k that I made from calls and transformed it to 860 bucks. I deposited 20k and with that last week and this week I made everything back. Wild ride
Cosmo is great the buffet is killer. The new casino resort world is ok it’s just far away. Definitely worth checking out because it’s clean and doesn’t smell of smoke.
How rude ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Warren said bears fuk
But you should know that a lot started with more than 10k and then lost it lol.
How do I buy calls on BRK.A?
Nahhhhh I need fucking answers right now
Banbet then bitch
Do you use strategies or just straight buy long calls or puts? If it’s the latter then that probably explains it.
That’s what I thought. We shall see.
Yeah, kinda sucks if we’re not making any profit almost like taking a side loss on top of your existing losses..
Guys am I banned? I don’t feel banned

I wish you the best of luck! I was gonna buy calls at close but I've been burned so many times I didn't have the balls to do it. If I wake up on time I'll probably buy calls at open, because they killed it and are bound to run up all day tomorrow.
No news either. Wtf just happened
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/RakeemP** bet **AMD** goes from **122.08** to **130.0** before **2021-10-31 20:36:31.908500-04:00**

This one’s for me and this one’s for me and oh this one’s for me too.
You supplying the buy in? I’m broke from spy FD’s
I’m actually curious how many people on this sub have more than 10k in there account. It’s probably way less than what most think.
No one's talking about it is what I'm saying
Switched to puts eod, still exited calls at +20%. Bring on the blood
Me too. Because I definitely own 100 shares of it…
do you think we'll have something like the French revolution in the next 25 years?

Cause of PYPL deal it propped up AFRM
84 cans of beans, nice
Maybe they did, but have they sold yet? If you held gme from January peaks, you might be looking at a few bucks profit if you sold at the right time. You'd be looking at waaaay more though if you just bought calls on aapl, or spy, or even tesla. I just don't get the gme Cult following. I buy gme calls, and they print  sometimes sure, but real stocks print way more consistently and predictably.
Escape, no, but you can try to evade taxes and death for some time, see how long it takes before they catch you.
They are going after the billionaires everywhere right now

No clue. They both suck nuts
I mean, your perception of a 10 is not going to be mine. It's way too subjective. If everyone's 10 counted as a 10, then I bet it would be under 1 in 5,000.

Never let friends know about your money.  Who knows about your money is your enemy.  Send your gains here so anonymous retards can pass judgment and remind you to take profits or diamond hand, then do the opposite of the consensus.  You'll still lose money but you'll still have friends.

It's hard to understand exactly why Tesla's market cap just jumped up by more than the entire market cap of Ford.  It's really hard to understand why Tesla is the world's biggest automaker when Toyota builds 100 cars for every one Tesla builds.  In fact it's hard to understand anything about Tesla's valuation.  So without understanding, you are just gambling.

Didnt sell my TSLA calls cus i only had 1 daytrade left before restriction...... even if i just sold one before they gapped down id be up at least 20% on the day still 😭

Instead im only up 4% from selling SPY and AMD early to split between TSLA and doubling down.... 

Theres hope for my SPY play still but i think these AMD and TSLA calls will probs be a loss (at least part of it is in a strangle where the put still has it profitable overall)

I didn't know the Seng ever went up?
Oh no its definitely a scam. It doesn't make any money and it hasn't released yet, it's a Chinese SPAC and they're already looking to get sued for violating the TOS for the free software they used. Its definitely not worth billions. And judging by most other trump businesses, it'll probably be bankrupt in a short time after he cooks the books inflating his losses for tax write offs 

The most money trump makes is renting his name to other successful businesses that he doesn't own because for some reason retards still associate him with successful businesses

Outstanding! I gotta listen to Surfin Bird now
Why doesn't Berkshire BRK.A have options?
I remember like a year ago there was a crisis because one of the busses didn't show up to a Trump rally or broke down or some shit and all the geriatrics didn't know how to get home. These people don't know how to buy stock. LOL
It's hit 300 3 times since January.. anyone who bought that high averaged down anyways
Where you from?
If it happens to drop by $1, just start buying double the shares to keep your cost per share down.  It will only drop if someone sells, so if that happens, you'll be buying their share.  Ezpz!

Thanks, and I’m also a big fan of The Ramones 👍
so i'm not saying that was a good idea, but let's be honest. if it wasn't scary to buy now, the price wouldn't be so low. i bought a little too, cuz we know that's going back up.

I am accumulating microchips one vaccine at a time.
I don't know if market orders are a thing in AH. On my platform, limit orders are required at certain times, including pre and after market stock, and for certain products, e.g. options for first couple of minutes of the trading day.

Bought at $40 and set a stop loss at $80 bc I knew it would be volatile. I am busy with work so I don’t have time to check the price all day, so that was my bailout point.
First people were talking non-stop about HOOD calls for earnings… now that it tanked they’re saying “rebound easy money, it’ll be back to 40”

Out of all the dumb things I’ve seen in the market, placing a market order on BRK.A AH is probably the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. 

Even dumber than the guy who went all in with his life savings  with calls on a single airline company during a pandemic.

Even leveraging 25x all in on AAPL puts before earnings.


At least those had a chance to pay off.

In a new twist of the Evergrande Group meltdown, Chinese authorities told its billionaire boss Hui Ka Yan to use his personal wealth to pay off the company’s 12-figure debt. 
  
The demand adds to signs that Beijing is reluctant to organize a government rescue while President Xi Jinping cracks down on the billionaire class. It also comes as the property giant’s woes spread to other developers and sours sentiment in the nation’s huge real estate market. 
  
One extra hiccup: It’s unclear whether Hui’s fortune is even big enough or liquid enough to make a dent in Evergrande’s $300 billion in debt.

So that 18 year old kid who bought the Tesla calls posted an screenshot where he was up 47k, over $50 dollar per contract. That shit closed at $12.10, since is so close to expiration date it would be lower tomorrow, and his average cost ~$16  each.  I guess the saying of if it is good to post is good to sell is not being repeated enough here 💀

ya that was extremely stupid to buy brka after hours without a limit. TBH I've thought about making money this way. find an extremely low volume option, charge an absurd price, and wait for someone to place a market order.
i feel mostly emotionally dead these days. it's sure beats feeling stuff
Does anyone actually know what happened to BRKB.A? 

I own BRKB.B but that’s just because they own all the insurance companies and usually can get you out of jury duty due to financial conflict interest.
His brk A stock went up 50% from 400k to 600k a share

But do tell them about your catastrophic losses so they lend you money and/or let you move in with them.
They are expecting a $40 GME like rebound perhaps. To get back even, when they will claim they will never sell? Strange individuals.
Their UI is really good. They are terrible though. And I own their stock. Might buy more tomorrow. They are the worst though. I pay SCHW thousands of dollars a year willingly on their 0.65 cent / contract fee and would rather do that than use HOOD. Why do I own their stock again?

They can go ahead and stop shaking their cups at him so he can focus on the long term issues and instead do some charitable work, or donate their money. Of all the billionaires, he's not the one to be getting up in arms over.
DWAC only down 6% AH, not bad.
Remember to never tell family or friends of your gains. It's not nice to lie to family and friends.

No have stop losses
ya i mean msft usually dumps after earnings, so that was probably a good play.

is there a real reason that CRSR has been dropping so hard recently? public sentiment when it was around the $30-35 range is that it was massively undervalued because of solid fundamentals. Then after it rocketed one day to the 40’s it’s been on a fairly consistent drop trading around $25 now. Is it just eagle trees owning such a large portion being the primary catalyst? personally I’m still bullish for medium to long term
Market crashes happen more often than once a century, my man.
if nobody was selling it would be impossible to buy lol. Plenty of ppl are selling. if nobody was selling and ppl were still buying the price would go to infinite.

What’s with people still pumping mango in here? If I really wanted a painful experience I’d rather short TSLA, go long GME, or buy OTM daily puts on SPY than touch that thing.

One of those boomers was on here and responded to my question about how it was being a retard during the tech boom compared to now. You mostly aren't wrong but some kept with the times.

Who cares if I don’t hit them. If that’s the case just hedge. You have nothing to lose trying.

Margin interest is 1%, lower than income tax. You also further offset any tax with charitable donations.

Average volume is 11, so it's likely whoever bought the most recent share had to do it at a high price for some reason.
It looks like there’s a lot of worry since AMD didn’t move much AH but that feels bullish as hell. If sentiment was bad despite that amazing earnings call, we would’ve seen HOOD level drops at the very least. Feeling hopeful for tomorrow.

I remember the fall of 2018. The Fed had a rate hike and the rate hike was not priced in. It fell 7 percent the next day. While earnings may be good now, the consumer is about to run out of cash. Surely earnings can’t be sustained. Not at this level. Margins may stay the same but demand certainly won’t. We have pulled forward about 6 years of demand. Price discovery is difficult. Think of what it will look like when the Fed injects less liquidity. It could be painful

Didn't even wipe. Ran back to the drivers side and got the fuck out of dodge.
Instructions are on the wiki page
Dude I respect you, but the market is WAY beyond the taper word at this point. That shit is 100% priced in. The market is looking at earnings right now and saying “fuck, maybe it ain’t so bad out there afterall”. 75% of S&amp;P companies have reported positive revenue surprise. And Nov/Dec are usually very strong. Just saying we’ve got a lot of tailwinds.

It hasn’t. Everyone destroying earnings proves the opposite of what you think. Lithium and EV and pretty much all EV related stocks have a ton of running to do in the next few years. Hydrogen isn’t even close to its actual worth. I can go on. I guess if you’re just looking at the same five stocks, sure it’s possible.

Ok, so where’s next earnings? What is there even to do when it’s not earnings season?

Not necessarily. You can usually tell who is pumping and who wants to genuinely help a brother out.

Pretty much. It’ll probably bounce back a bit before open to fuck up a chance at easy money, but still probably a sure thing with months out OTM calls.

I really like MQ. Not a meme stock. And it has been on a wild rally, so idk if you would want to buy into it at this moment. But it's worth doing some DD on and keeping it in you watch list at the minimum. 

I'm long  300 shares and will be adding on any substantial dips.
Thank fk I sold my AMD calls at 300% gains before EOD. Would have been IV crushed tomorrow. Underlying is down almost 1% AH.

Anyone who answers isn't going to have your best interest at heart.

Also, Tesla dropped after earnings and then pumped 20% in the week (won’t happen with AMD) but don’t worry about earnings too much.

Yes OTM calls are my favorite
the exchanges and the stablecoin issuers are all totally dependent on the price of corn being high so there's always a suspiciously strong bid on low volume all the time
Lmk what’s good
Hold, 100%. Its dumped for 2 reasons, SNAP earnings and PayPal deal rumors. SNAP is an indirect cause, and to me the PayPal deal is noise. Basically what it says to me is that PINS views their company as worth more than what PayPal offered. If PINS is committed to their worth, you should be too. +15% on earnings.
Hope my amd calls aren’t IV crushed 🙏

Okay, wait. Wait. So, if I did buy the stock: I'm retarded. If I don't buy the stock: I'm a coward. I agreed it was a pump and dump (shown in the links), but I guess you're too delusional to realize that, too. So, I can't win, no matter what with you lunatics? Yeah, I figured as much.

Okay, next. The stock is still way above its starting point, you delusional sack of crazy. It did touch 100. It almost hit 200.

Okay, next. Yes, I did defend Trump from you crazy people. He's not perfect. He's not a god. But, he's not a fucking scam artist either. So, what? Is that what this is about? I defended Trump?

There's gotta be ways to filter out accounts like this [https://www.reddit.com/user/ZaRaWi/](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZaRaWi/) &lt;- this FuelCell, but you get almost identical profiles but for gamestore and theater and whatever else is being shilled. It's almost formulaic. Or the phrase "This is the confirmation bias I've been looking for" from another user.

Derivatives should be tradable any time the underlying is trading.  Such bullshit.
No you can sell whenever, you guys don’t realize this. So up 500% on $102 is like cheating
NIO Something of big are going to happen

Done with the casino so far
I'm praying for spy to go down to 455 so I can rotate into calls.
Nobody gives a shit that you’re too pussy to put your money where your mouth is. It’s that you keyboard warriored for Trump and called everyone that was calling out the p&amp;d bullshit a moron. Take your L and fucking move on

When TSLA goes from 850 to 1000, that's ***150 Billion U.S. Dollars*** added to their market cap, all from some news that Hertz will be spending 4.2 Billion on cars.

So, 4 Billion in the news turns into 150 Billion in the market cap. Got it. It seems crazy, but, these are crazy times.
I do both. Unloaded before earnings buying back in sometime this week when iv drops--leaps are in smaller caps mainly
there was 3 shares in AH at that price
We are not doing anything, what are you doing?
&gt; I would say that depends on the context. If you are looking for a long-term relationship, I'd go with the skinny girl every time. However, if it's just one night of fun and pleasure then why not have both?

Well, I’ve sure been tortured by his Dwac.
Why can’t I fuckin stay away from that pile of shit!
With earnings coming up too. I like that. Are they into VR and shit? I know COD is a monster

Hey, that would be great for my $459 calls that expire next week.
I sat on my hands all day and then bought calls at close. Up 7.65% in AH, hilarious.
That sux
#MFA is pissing me off. Been going sideways for ages. Anybody else in it?
Yeah, wealth is never created. It’s a zero sum game.
I was doing so well today, but then I just had to YOLO everything into earnings. Bye bye all my money.
F the astros
Yep,  bought my 12c at the top. 😔
I’ve done nothing but lose thousands of dollars all week.
What is it, Tuesday?

Fuuuuuuuuuuck.
Tsla $1,550 EOW $102 turns into $15,500

Worth the risk, it’s only $102
&gt; It's down now.
I'm so mad at my dumb losses in hood and fb.
I think I'll just cash out all my existing holdings and put it in one option.

If it burns it burns and I'll be done with the casino.
Ok gotcha
What happened? It was up bigly this morning when I checked.
Look at me, I am the 🤡 now

No yesterday and then today I traded my $1,050 calls for $1100 calls during the run up and at one point it hit 70k then rug pill and it closed today valued at 11k because I didn’t sell
Glitch if it was real Brk B would have went up as well. Both of the prices move together in tandem. They go up and down together, and never deviate much from the 1/1500 ratio.
Should have bought more 🥭puts today 🤷‍♂️
Hmm, interesting, thanks!
Twitter call doesn't seem to be having a big effect. Might have to wait until morning to see.
Yeah lol it’ll go closer to the bid ask as soon as someone sets something reasonable. I mean if people really start sending orders on both sides at the current price then it can hang out up there, but this is a big oops.

There definitely are glitches at times, but this definitely was an order after hours today

The hype was mere extended for another week, why wouldn’t it :)
You turned 1700 into 20,000 today?  On one Tesla play?  I’m doing this wrong
I tripled my account today day trading Tesla. Yolod into Hood. Gonna probably die tomorrow. Is what it is.
I think it is stupid not to buy this FB dip. Same shit happened last year and they bounced back weeks later.

Yeah I’ve been here before. I’ve had a -75% day and I’ve been down $50,000 in a single day too. I was able to bounce back from that and I’m still positive overall. I just can’t help myself from FOMOing at the top of pump and dumps lol

Wish has an EV value of 1.8 billion. That means that if you decide to outright buy the company, that is how much you are really going to be paying. Does anyone think that despite the headwinds that it is currently  experiencing, it is worth so fucking little?  Shopify has identical revenue and is worth more than 50x than Wish. Yeah, yeah "investors are pricing in a potential bankruptcy", but with practically non-existent debt and 80 million monthly users, I do not see this happening any time soon.

Bruh who tricked me into ocgn puts 😖
Someone fucked up on buying BRK.A after hours, and now it's up over 50%!

Yeah but i couldnt sleep with 1k left
Spy puts finna print
Somebody put a market order in for 4 shares after hours and overpaid huge
It’s just a ticker and a number. Nothing matters. Tsla to 2k.

I'm holding my visa shares tight. Remember apple dropped 7 - 10 percent after the most profitable quarter ever. Earnings don't matter in this market
Wow this is very market related, thank you
I know SPY will end red tomorrow but I forgot to buy puts. Now rather than sit on my ass and do nothing what should I YOLO my money into?
I see the OCGN bagholders are shilling their bags again today.
I have a Tesla 1200 weekly I bought at the top for 12.25 now worth about blink 1.82... I'll be happy to get out at -50% tmmrw

Edit: I still did good and was blessed by elon
Bought some AMD 10/29 135c at close today, how fuk am I?
AMD is a buy on any dip
American here, how do i invest in european stocks




Said no one ever
&gt; I'm long on AMD. It's a good company with great technology and management, but not enough money to do everything it wants to do. I think this will change in the next year or two when they get their new chip fab up and running
Does Twitter have metaverse? Sir stay in your lane
Hey, my abacus says you're up 8 grand. And that ain't bad
Calls on stress
Oh no! Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, fuck $WISH
Was the 8k worth the mental stress
Lol wtf $225k a share increase.
Are you long on AMD? I'm fairly new to this forum, so I'm trying to figure out if you guys mainly do all the weird short/options/calls shit that I know nothing about it, or if you're looking for long holds as well.
That’s true I like making money too

Will Tesla retest 1100 tomorrow?

Don’t think you can market buy after hours
Small bet, not really worth worrying about tbh. Always risky holding into earnings.
Oh

With way more upside!

They're still coming at me over Mango stock jokes and memes.

I'm going to just write off everyone that says anything to me about it as an autist and ignore them from now on. It's getting ridiculous and quite sick.

EDIT: Oh, don't just downvote. Feel free to respond. Make it easier on me so I never have to deal with you ever again.
How are you down 80% YTD when we literally just got done with a massive bull run for the first 8 months of the year, had a nice pullback, and are now ripping higher??
I’d buy you a Lambo for being prescient. I have 457p

All in 4 weeks 🥴
Two weeks of teasing me with easy gains, but now we’re back to “dips that won’t stop dipping”.
HOOD probably had the same calls and orders and they made sure theirs filled.
That’s slightly less than what my domme charges me to pee in my mouth. I’d be crying over them $200 rn

They did a good job.
Coulda woulda shoulda, my 5 HOOD $42 calls are probs fucked. They were up 80% at market close on that little pop to $40 and I had a sell order in that didnt fill. Oh well, F puts dont let me down.
So puts on New Zealand?

Wasnt sure if Tesla was going to 1200 or 850. After today it seems like the latter of the two
For the next week or so for sure

Some poor intern dun goofed.

Jokes aside no idea. Three shares were bought in the span of four minutes, so could be a fat finger or could be an algos bugging a market buy instead of limit
Friendly reminder to all that the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent
I broke even for the year this morning and put half of it into SPY 460 calls. If it tanks for the next 2 weeks I’ll be back at -50% if it doesn’t hooray Halloween in Vegas. 

The best way to not care is only gamble with one account. Have a responsible adult 401k/IRA that’s tax advantaged and 3 fund all that. 

Then buy spy FDs with the play money.
Oh see, that’s where we are different. I love feeling like an idiot.
Realize that money comes and goes. My dad lost 1.5m in the 2008 crash AND his construction business AND his brother and dad died. He said he just woke up every day and appreciated everything he still had. My siblings and my mom, his other family, good movies and fishing etc. Money is just money. I lost 250k which was 75% of my port and I made back 220k of it on TSLA calls yesterday so I may be biased atm lol
Brk.a new spac
I fucking hope so lol
What do you guys think of the flair “possibly the greatest voice of our generation”
May be for the pop I wouldn’t touch it long term due to how easy it is to compete in that space
I appreciate the advice man. I think I’ll hop away for a while lol. Good luck!

Pretty sure that's most of us here. Did that with FB puts today.
Balance. It's not all about money. Take a walk, take a deep breath, take several deep breaths, punch a child. You know, do things that spark joy in you.
Definitely a cultist. Literally, every bounce is shorter and smaller than the previous one. Also, fuck off.

Oh shit. I misread your post and didn’t see the put part.

[deleted]
I can never just sell the calls when they are up 1000%.. gotta wait til I’m -10% at least, or at least that’s the trend for me lately :/
Nah this is too easy
Already did in Aug and Sept. Bought a fuck ton of June ‘22 calls. That’s why you never buy FDs. Gotta buy yourself some time.  8 months til I’m actually fucked.
If you are down 80% in this market you are just a degenerate gambler, stop now and go buy index funds before you ruin yourself for good financially.
This a situation where I’m normally stoked I bought SPY puts then get fucked the next day, so inversed myself and bought calls. Do your thing this week spy
Oh wtf I was told by like 15 people it was glitch. Will it go back down tmrw?
Fuck. I almost bought calls on VZ today. It was tempting.
I remember in the mayhem of early 2020 I lost 5k on calls and puts. You know what I did starting May of that year? Selling credit spreads expiring in a year to a year and a half. First one I remember doing it on was CCL when it was trading at like 19. My strikes were 10/7.5 for 2023. 

That’s how I rebuilt my account and all my lost money. Left theta gang once. Never leaving them again.

DWAC going back to 10 like every other fucking spacs

Don't play weekly options with money you actually need.
I've been looking for land and residential real estate ETFs, but they are hard to find, especially with volume. 

But industrial real estate ETFs and REITs are everywhere.

I demand a flair that is more fitting of a user of my stature
MSFT pleas fly
I saw a ban bet for brk.a to 500k and I just assumed the person was retarded then I look at share price and go what in the unholy fuck?

Edit* is the volume I’m seeing correct? 1 share traded at the PM price? Or was it a boatload and a fat finger?
Probably a reverse split if I had to guess

Stop fomo’ing, sell a few credit spread expiring in a year and get some easy wins under you belt to build up confidence.
Okay
Honestly I wouldn’t invest into stocks anymore it’s a dinosaurs game, especially around earnings. Tesla is worth 1 trillion yet has 1.6b in revenue. bUt iTs ThE fUtUrE ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Yeah the AH after this big earnings day looks like shit, this might be it
Yeah as long as it can maintain $1k amidst the turbulence it should be fine to keep going. One thing it does have going for it is that its the best volatility index so it could just inverse the market but who knows 🤷
put your last 20% into GME. you'll thank me one day
You can start by not trading with money that you can't afford to lose.

Oh, 1150, I just need it to retrace 1050.
Hoping for a -1% open and just a nice bleed

Zoom out on the 1Y and match to other tech player's earnings. I'm bullish on TSLA but this week is probably going to be a wash imo. I think business as usual next week for it
I would wait an hour or two ;)
Is there really? It was so bad at first I thought I had covid. Still feel like shit weeks later
I'll ask the same question. How is the stock up 200,000 on 4 shares?
I think it’s a glitch for the price for it rn on Robinhood
Can someone explain what is happening with BRK.A please lol
Don't forget about the early investor shares being unlocked to sell. It could go lower...

All the DD I needed
I wanna see some 🥭 loss porn

Still haven’t seen that even 

Even tried to warn them what would happen
Wait, so that’s out?
Who is playing the drums on the AMD earnings call. lol
break in momentum
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/MJH228 (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 420.69 when it was 432.55 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
$FB puts right when the market opens, because of all the whistleblowing and leaked information.
All earnings are priced in from this date forward.
Shit no one tells you ever
well see what happens tomorrow. hoping for 130
Hood going back to 38 tomorrow
And then you have to pay capital gains tax which is even higher.
Hatred is the devil's seed of evil
JPow said credit is transitory
Oh no. Where did you get your degree btw
Based on what catalyst
I'm putting my bets on earnings being priced in already. Probably gonna drop because people expected it to go up.
Spite.
Y’all realize amd was at $100 a month ago right? Earnings has been priced in for a week
"looks like it's about to break out" is always a fucking lie. Do people actually believe this astrology shit they spew, or are they just trying to unload bags?
Probably a big brain move, he bought it for 661k, now the market price for it is 661k. He's technically breakeven. Until he buys another at close for 1.2k and suddenly he has 4 stocks worth 1.2m each.

Now he's basically doubled his money.

quick maths
sure...
What if they got a loan from Tesla? Infinite money printing trick.
earnings were great. wait for tomorrow. i have confidence.
f u bears!!!
RIP u/cashflow_
selling options were the play coming into earnings, even with Tesla if you sold those calls/puts you had 2-3 days to get out and/or add. The juicy IV into earnings is juicy
$AMD calls and $INTC puts, got it
So glad I bought back my puts![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)

Earnings. Sideways or red AH. People pissed. Rinse and repeat.
Visa tanking could be bad news for market tomorrow as it is seen as bell weather for how consumers are spending
Same. 😔
the logic is its going down

also put spreads are cheap af
depends if being poor is a crime
What do the algos use when they're carrying the market most days
Nice, dude! I’d love to get there someday but I’m playing with a small amount of money (sub $1,000) so it may be a while 🙂
280 my guess but sell before earnings
No, your broker will restrict your account for 90 days.  No trades.  They'll let you slide once, though.

I believe 1200 EOW
Circuit breaker for BRK.A tomorrow?
Hmmmm. I may have gotten a little too ambitious with TSLA calls this morning.
Seriously tho. I know Buffett said he would never split the stock (hence the insane price per share). But imagine if he split the stock now since stock splits apparently increase shareholder values. He could just do a 10,000-1 split and then the price would go back up to 437,000 in a year.
My point, shit will be $1,200 tomorrow
NFLX got downgraded by Goldman fuck
I thought their earnings were good
If im flagged as a pattern day trader without proper capital, can the sec arrest me?
I wanna say, to the people that told me Banbet pussy on MSFT 315, Get fucked I'm still here kicking.
Nvidia technical breakout how high we going?
Bag holding calls but the logic I can see is just general market turbulence cause of tech earnings
That's actually huge news for this market. That's essentially the whole engine.

Just YOLO'd into brk-a because the ticker reminds me of the Breaking Bad credits. Is it a dog food company? 🥺
Those were some fun gme vibes. Peak retardation
Incredible earnings not translating in price? Buy options a few weeks out.

That simple to getting your first bag.
A little satire never hurt nobody
they restructured and also got bought out. and with economy reopening, they had positive cash flow as businesses were renting again. Things are solid for them b/c of how crazy used car market is and that shit's not going to be solved until late 2022 or 2023

Wtf is going on with Visa - 4% AH
Going to buy BRK.A at $1,000,000
HOOD bagholders: this is fine
Can you taste or smell
TSM down 5.6% AH 

Or at least google says so
take some aspirin and call it a day
Everything is priced to absolute perfection. What could possibly go wrong.
Booooo
Oh yeah I’m too poor for that right now lmfao
my nuts are priced into your mouth
Oh, well, looks like tomorrow is my last day here for the following week. Should be beneficial for my portfolio.

I used to be addicted to soap, but I'm clean now
I pray to god it does a black flip. I cashed out at 900 bucks. Bought back in thinking it was gonna keep going up, now I’m down 600 dollars. Smh. I truly am retarded
Bought QQQ calls for this very occasion
When two vegans get in an argument, is it still called a beef?
logic?
The supply chain buttfuckening is hitting the entire sector.
And of course Tesla decides to keep fucking me after-hours also
Reading is hard… Checking tomorrow doesn’t mean shit they are making money hand over fist the stock price  might not reflect that. I never said AMD stands for Always Making Me Dough
**I’ll be at the store just chilling and my mind keeps repeating “I’m an Island  boy in an island world” 🤡**
yesterday FB was up 2% before ending AH at 1.37% (up almost 4% ah)- earnings were out AH - shit doesn't mean nothing
When? Not seeing anything on it right now. TXN is dropping bc they had in-line guidance (dumb reason for a drop), but not seeing any sympathy dip in TSM.
I bought at 85 and now 35. Highly volatile
AMD not falling off a cliff is good, I think. Even flat tomorrow is fine. Avoiding that -10% day is huge
Gonna buy this CLOV dip for the millionth time![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Probably just go down a bit on everything, like your mom.
Going to purchase my first TSLA call ever as soon as my funds settle.

On the $AMD earnings call right now and Lisa is basically politely saying that they've even surprised themselves on how well they're eating $INTC's lunch in the server market and Intel's BS excuse about China slowdown being a cause for mediocre earnings is not a problem that they are seeing at $AMD lol.
How many 🥭s are being held in those heavy bags?! Lol for all the nerds on Friday saying it was going to $200+... You clearly haven't been on WSBs long enough.

I have been waiting for a sub 20 entry.  These guys are still 3-4 years out on their tech.  It's a LONG hold if you can get in at the right price.
TSLA holding above 1k when it jumped basically $100, what’s your logic in puts
Allergies or cancer
Cos it's cheap and I like It join the reddit forum do some dd

Yeah, I sold him the shares. I had the limit sale in place at that price as a joke 😌
good point cletus - build the wall (of sells), lock them up (the bagholders)
QS is gonna drill so hard tmrw.
Bought 107 shares at 9.15. Lets goo!
no, 3 shares of BRK.A
It's still in a bullish channel, too, even with the mild downward spikes today... which also happened during last earnings. It's currently bouncing off the SMA100. I bought a put debit spread to hedge my call debit spreads. Puts weren't dumb because the run is heavily extended, but there's still room to run and the yearly chart is still showing a very bullish but extended run. Puts were not the move.

Having said that, the candlestick today is bearish, but given that declining into earnings is a common pattern even during bullish divergences, I'm not putting a ton of weight on it... could take a downward path out of the channel tomorrow, though, in which case could easily fall back to 120 or 118.

What’s risk management?
Past says it will pull back after earnings. Overall I'm bullish on them and will buy back in sub 300
i dunno the statistics but id place a large bet options traders do far worse than shareholders
Yes.
it's because they said the apple ios 14 change didnt affect them as much as they thought it would, unlike SNAP

Zuck better start buying back these cheap shares.
Try and exercise a contract on a hundred shares of BRK…..
more about the outlook but seriously, whether the company misses or beats comes down to how good the analysts are at guessing the exact earnings number.

If they miss, those analysts should be fined or fired. Expectations are only used to manipulate prices. Not complaining, I love a manipulated market, just pointing it out.

Here's a nice piece of shit.
I'm just glad everyone was smart enough to exit out all their calls today and start to  hedge a little bit.
So if you could sell one 🥭 tomorrow for $56 or sell that same 🥭 for $10 one week from now what would you do?
The fact that a company that went through bankruptcy proceedings a year ago can afford to buy 100,000 Teslas seem shady to anyone else?

Hood revenue shows that they were the reason doggy coin went to the fking moon (with the help of Elon pumping it) , all they have to do to increase next quarter's revenue is add the retarded shib and other shit coins.
Ban test.

Nope, not banned.
Clever.
First SPY call this month!
It was never once in the green!

You deserve everything headed your way.

Lmao okay Cathie. Isn’t this the same fool who said the oil industry is facing the same fate as “whale oil” at the turn of the 20th century??? That’s just your opinion Cathie, and like usual, it’s probably wrong.

BRK.A BEING INCLUDED IN SPY
BAN
If it’s down tomorrow I’m buying calls.
tbh I don't really know how reliable Yahoo is for after hours pricing, but if you look right now it'll still say it's up over 50%.
Everything is going red.
Probably in HOOD or something
Uhh, we get to pay commissions
That's worth a whopping $0.13.
$0.07 you say?
$OCGN and $SDC calls at open. Let’s go baby
Now this explains the weak ass afterhours volume
That’s okay, I will sell this call before next week.
They thought actual degenerate debt was getting erased. Don't know it's not a documentary. But it could be
How fucked are my $ATVI 10/29 $83c
Depends if tech doesn't commit die when the opening bell rings
Bangin
Ah okay, understandable. Shouldn’t be too bad, you’ll probably break even in about 50 years or so.
Watch HOOD merge with DWAC
Well I was right after all, unamerican my ass
We didn’t even touch the 150 or 200 MA on spy lol
Wife gets stressed out when the movers are 15 minutes late showing up while I’m in the corner checking my TSLA FDs trying to figure out if we’re moving into a mansion or a trailer park.
Wut mean
If it was market order could have filled that price. Who the fuck market buys a 400k stock ill never know
Fb gaped my asa
What?
someone paid 660k for them?
Corsair is falling after hours following a -4% day.. UNBELIEVABLE
#MY NUTS
&gt; You should call Robin Hood support and tell them to cancel your order.
Brk.a jumped 50 percent afterhours
Volume of 3. Someone fucked up 😂
**Sorry guys my finger slipped on Brk.A do I call Robin Hood support and tell them to cancel my order?? Or is it to late?**
Yeah they rnt bad… I’ve cut back on the ipas and have been drinking mostly modelo now
If I was a billionaire and they were about to tax my unrealized gains, I'd sell-off spy overnight and take my gains, wreck their economy and tell them fuk ur tax
My options held overnight sure as fuck agree witchu
Not as bad as buying BRK.A for $661k/share tho
Money laundering? I wonder if the uber rich could be like, yo, you owe my $300K, I'm placing a sell order on 3 shares of BRK.A at 50% markup, buy that shit. float is so low they could do it lol
wow! all the bigg earnings beats a/h sold right off.

Down 2% tomorrow on S &amp; P?

Maybe

Bought barely OTM Puts on GME, PLTR and CLOV just before closing. Been watching the meme discussions for a few weeks before deciding today.

&amp;#x200B;

BanBet Parlay on all three:

PLTR $23.50

GME $168.00

CLOV  $6.48

All by Nov. 5 close of day
BRK.A SPY after spending bill comes out?
Thank u sir. Life savings now in CGC
Not TWTR although their earning was bad. 

Ask me how I know. I bought PUT
How?
2024 LEAPs after IV settles, if you want to play pharma.
Vlad mentioned something about robinhood being on Snapchat but I didn’t catch exactly what he said
Sometimes i wake up in the middle of the night and it feels like i’m looking through a kaleidoscope is this normal
That was me. I forgot to put a limit order in 🤡
Imagine options existing on BRK.A. One contract controlling roughly $44M worth of equity.

With those AH numbers, each ATM contract would on paper have netted you like 20M each if this were to continue during market hours tomorrow.
No, but nice job. Next week market is due for a quick and bloody drawback
Robinhood delisting in 3.....2.....
If you sold those top otm calls good on you
Not a glitch. 3 shares were purchased and probably some poor intern's ass is grass tomorrow morning
Im gonna buy HOOD at $7
Leg up or leg down into spreads.

Volkswagen. Their largest shareholder. QS likely won’t be generating revenue for another couple years but they have developed groundbreaking batteries that charge in approximately 15 minutes, and have an incredibly long range &amp; life expectancy.
Looks like it but probably choppy from here on out.
For what?... I've never been.
Down 1.5k AH
Feeling bad about my FB calls but telling myself it could be worse. Could be in DWAC 😂
HIMX short interest as of 10/15:

[https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original\_396328046.png](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_396328046.png)

24.7 Million shares out of 173 Million (outstanding) shares = About 14.3%. I'm curious what the numbers will say for 10/30 once it's released a while after earnings.

I suppose shorts think that semiconductor companies will revert back to shitty EPS and revenue, or that China will invade Taiwan? I have no idea why HIMX is the one stock being shorted so much, but I suppose that's what happens for lower-cap companies.

$HIMX is still a solid long-term pick, IMO. It's DDIC revenue in Automobiles is growing and they are positioning themselves as a top supplier (30%\~ market share).

Q3 Earnings is November 3rd, where expected EPS will be .75 - .81. Cumulative EPS is $1.00 for Q1+Q2. There is the potential the $HIMX will payout about a $2 dividend (depending on Q4 results), based on previous dividends (&gt;75%).  Luckily, HIMX is usually spot on with EPS &amp; Revenue guidance as they already have an idea of orders in advance.

Based on the current stock price (low 10's), that's close to a 20% dividend yield, which is actually insane for a company that is continuously growing in EPS/Margin/Revenue. This will be the 5th? consecutive quarter of ATH revenue growth.
$10.01
I sold my 50 puts already.  Re-upped with 35p
they want 5? give em 15, market says Biden is high testosterone.
You mean 16% / 1.50 in less than 2 minutes ? Then a further 10% / 1 dollar in an instant later ?

I just don’t understand how they’re not making money when everyone retard on here is using it
Like lobster it's just market priced
Bears desperately waiting for a pullback like an uncircumcised penis
is it me or BRK.A price is glitching AH?
Dude is choking 😂
Unamerican behavior spotted.
And kneepads
I chose CGC bc they’re in less debt, quicker to profits, and biggest one.
Prob should have waited for a cool off. Huge potential company but short term it was overpriced
You mean Tiny Tim?
No way that was a fat finger.   It's all digits off.  Money laundering or someone thinks it's a very safe harbor for tomorrow.
Same here, now to figure out who’s the retard that bought those.
I hate that damn stock. Always think its too expensive and miss out on gains
Inflation who?
it actually opened red after earning. All the running seems to occur after the IV ball crush
Lol I bought 14 39 calls for Friday. Probably completely fucked. Maybe we will get some news idk. Probably not.
Take a picture and remember that moment
If you can still move, the fucking wasn’t enough😉
Weird AH spike on brk.a
This the only believable answer. Nobody else is that retarded.
Grats!

Bought todays dip
I just got off the phone with Reuters. It was Cathie who bought the BRKA shares above market. She was quoted as saying, "We just like this setup."
Not sure if this might count as selling. Might just have to wait until tomorrow
Anyone else grab BRK.A calls before close?
wow earnings are so eerily flat.
I have a severe Put allergy but will risk breaking out in hives Thursday or Friday.
What in the actual fuck 600k plus now? Some shady shit is coming! Alright boyz time to load up on ramen 🍜
Don’t try to explain low volume after hours. Let them be.
Already priced in; I expect less than a 2% SPY pullback when taper actually happens. 2022 will be a very bullish year.
That would be stupid given his deal with Adidas is worth billions
Price went up. Then it went down.

Amazing. Despite jumping as high as 13, the stock is actually 2% down from yesterday.
No value left in this market. Everything getting killed after earnings 

... except TSLA 😎
Might as well buy that [$HOOD dip](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HOOD?p=HOOD), you know it is going to recover quickly, whether we want it to or not.

\-9% after hours to $36.00. ATL is 33.25, ATH is 85.00.

what is TSLA splitting from, and why would they split.
Lol went through final round interviews with them a few months ago and ultimately lost to one other person. They said that person seemed better for mentoring juniors 🤷‍♂️

Quite optimistic about the company though. Big focus on sustainability and quality materials.

Nor supposed to share this but w/e - their focus over the next few years will be in international markets. Notably EU and Eastern Asia. And they will look to build in-house software solutions to phase out Shopify dependency. You didn't hear this stuff from me 🤫

It must be a drug failure. I don't even have to check the news to know. Algos sold that shit 😂😭
I'd probably have to sell both my kidneys and a lung to afford one...

does the va check reduce your govt pension when you retire?
Big tech earnings: priced in
Did you pay $100 for it? It should be worth 3.5k max if HOOD goes to zero.
Su bae dropping bullish bombs left and right. Amazing growth
Because puts have limited profit, unlike calls. Theoretically, a call has unlimited potential, but a company can only lose so much value until it goes to 0. At this point, the put has obtained maximum value.
My 401k is up 19%ytd but my "personally managed" portfolio is down 40% ytd lol
I bought a few hundred shares.
It’s actually easier for BRK.A since it has lower volume and shares, we just don’t normally see it because it usually follows BRK.B

Hopefully to the moon. I decided to trade options for the first time. Went all in on SPY calls.
I don’t want to live on this planet anymore
M$ft getting no love for those bomb ass earnings. People would rather go buy 🥭 stock
let me give you a tip: anything that happens outside of market hours isn't real. market hours are all you need to watch. futures, premarket, after hours, etc is just algos fighting with day traders.
It own TWTR
I definitely agree. There is room for them to expand if they seize it. An environmentally conscious shoe company can be very successful, think Tom’s. I just don’t know if investors will see that in the current landscape. I’d like to buy in at a price around $8 a share, but we’ll see if I get to see that. I’ve seen much worse companies IPO for way more
Pardon me, I can not help you🤷🏼‍♀️
why is ever1 talking about berkshire?

Imagine having a 3DTE FD for BRK.A
Guys I bought some Brk.A with my TSLA gains but I think I hit the wrong button….
This guy Tuesday’s.
##BRK-A RUNNING GOTTA BE A BAD SIGN
Nah you should be good
Grrrr
I was skeptical but I just bing’d it and it’s true.
Yeah looks like many were confident about AMD and bought in before ER. So we might not see a spike tomorrow.
You know things are gonna be good when they ha a star wars playlist playing in the AMD ER call.
imagine marrying a wife more than half your age
Can we overcome the wall of worry - fomc, taper, corporate tax, China default contagion, inflation, the whole debt ceiling thing we kicked down the road? Tune in at the end of this week and next week.

&gt; “The first recorded use of the word ‘fuck’ was in 1528, as an alternative spelling for the past tense form of ‘ficken’ (meaning to have sexual intercourse), and appeared in a German poem. The etymology is uncertain, but it may be related to dialectal Dutch fokken (to thrust or copulate) or Old English fōcian (to move quickly). It also has cognates with Latin futuere and French faire l'amour. In this sense "fuck" can mean sex generally; however, its usual meaning is limited to penetrative vaginal intercourse."

"Dating is like pulling off a successful heist. It's fun, it's thrilling, and you seem to have gained a lot from nothing. But marriage is like getting arrested after that crime. You lose your rights, your liberty, and when the adrenaline finally wears off, you realize how dreary your life has become, doing mundane chores and eating the same three square meals every day. It's a stable but banal existence that will suck the life out of you."

Lost ad revenue, YouTube sales down, cloud computing sales down. Still a monster that's not going anywhere, but that's why I stay long and don't trade!

seems like they never rip on earning nowadays except to the downside occasionally

Good earnings doesn't mean your options will print. Almost 100% IV on Friday calls, gonna need a big gap up for those to print when IV drops tomorrow.
GAAAAYYYYY
You can say DWAC, you don't have to use pseudotickers here. After you have searched it a few times. it will probably come up quicker.
So you put all your profits from spy, tesla and msft to ber.A 

Fuk you rich ppl

Dollar store protein powder.
Holding onto DKNG calls at 50, 52, and 54 strikes through earnings. Yes I’m aware not to play earnings, but that’s generally due to an uptrend into earnings. Not a downtrend based on a merger that ended up being canceled. 60/40 I end up fucking myself.
At least earnings seasons is becoming more like the hunger games.
HOW THE FUCK DOSE AMD CRUSH EARNINGS BUT IT GOES DOWN
Not for your wife's boyfriend
Can someone explain why Brk.a just mooned 50%
I'll fly a starship

Everything in tech seems to be priced in, look at the blowout q3 Google had and it dropped. Msft had absolutely insane earnings and it’s barely holding.

Good luck retards. Going to eat some stale potato chips now. The green chips are the best.
i think the way to play AMD earnings was the run up to them, it's too unpredictable to know what's gonna happen after
I hope very likely I’m in for 460c 10/29
😆

You can find this info by yourself. Just google.

Have sex as much as you can while you’re young. Once you get a wife, it’s over. As awesome as the first 3 months is, it will become 0 activity

Nope but you can call up geico and tell them you have it for an 8% discount.
AMD increased sales by 50% and share price goes down🤔 what kind of fucked world do we live in
Probably up
The last time ENPH ran up to $200 then very quickly dropped again, I regretted not unloading it. I think I should take some profit this time and buy it back later. Cost basis is $142.24.
HOOD is going to announce in guidance they are buying 100 TSLA cars this quarter for Vlad and the boys.

HOOD will be up 50% tomorrow
Someone laundering some dough via casual "OOPSIE" $200k BRK over payment strategy. A tale as old as time.
Selling DWAC yesterday at 100 and rolling into HOOD at 38 a share resulted in less loss than if I had just bagheld DWAC.

I like Allbirds a lot (did an advertising case study on them a few years ago), but not sure how well they will do. Brand awareness not super high, difficulties expanding into stores and stuff. I’d like to buy it but I’m not sure the $14 it’ll open at will be right
    Are you not entertained?

That’s what they all say

AAPL bull gang lets goooo
Ccl downgrade by citi has me hurting
The Q3 earnings slides that AMD published right now said merger is still on track to complete by end of year.  China approves ~96% of mergers so the chance is objectively that good
50k shares bought up by INTC insiders today (5 separate) might be worth a short term play
Maybe not. But I have until next week.
some ret just bought 1 share of BRK.A for $120K above the market price?!

The "mysterious" 🐳 that keeps manipulating TSLA with massive call option purchases every week is none other than Elon Musky as he tries to inflate his options (basically his only salary), a large chunk of which expires in Q4 2021. He talked about this back in Sept at the code con. SEC is 😴💤
Anyone with L2 market data able to check how many BRK.A shares were bought at 660k AH? 

Was probably just one, but would be fucking hilarious if 4 were filled and some idiot new to their trading app is down nearly 1M because they placed a market order instead
Can’t wait to hear your voice Subae 💖
waiting for the pit-fall then same day recovery
What is your entry point you are waiting for?
I was wondering why the fuck you retards talking about BRK.A , 3 shares bought AH for an instant 600k loss.
I'm gonna need a refund Warren thanks

My portfolio sends hugs
I can't believe there's a Chinese EV brand with dealers all over the US and the cheapest car you can buy in the US and a stock you can buy on the US stock market and yet I never found out all this until the past few days. I wasted so much time researching way more expensive EVs and going through lists that never even mentioned these cars. Reminds me of that episode of the Simpsons where Homer buys some Eastern European car and he has to "put it in H" and how I always wished the US auto market allowed deals like that in my era.

Oh wow, maybe you don’t belong here?
HOOD, Take from the poor and give to the rich
Vlad you dumb bitch.
I fucking hope so man… I’d break even at this point
Mine is always dirty with poor maintenance
Chill, it could bounce tomorrow
AMD up 0.13% after hours is basically INTC drilling 10% on their earnings lmaooooooooo
Hope my SPY calls were a good idea
I know, i know, i belong here....
Okay maybe this is too far
People who asking why amd isnt doing anything? Are you dumb? That stock was at 99 two weeks back, 30 dollars gapup
Can somebody tell me why the market went up bigly, then came down a bit and farted into the close?

gold for funniest/best answer.
Looks like Vlad turned off the buy button on HOOD
Source or ban
Is this not bullish?
TSX is a strange place. How can I lose sleep thinking about my investment if I don't have news about it for 17,5 hours?
BRK-A
When they say it was a race who could get undressed quicker, but I've been naked the whole time
What's going on?
Russia is the literal bear in this whole scenario.
It’s up 25% in a month……
There’s absolutely no way of knowing.

Someone should consider recording that somehow.
Bought some EOD too!
It’s only 4 grand…. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)💩
I suspect that EOD action is a preview of what happens as we get closer to tapering next week plus possible discussion of rate increases.
Some guy mentioned a couple weeks ago that selling 15p on CRTX was easy money.  I've been watching it because it was around 70 then and a 185 call was going for around 2500.  I hope he didn't sell any 15ps.... lol
Worried about my spy calls now 😬
Retards - for every share of $XLNX you own, you will exchange for 1.72 $AMD shares when the merger happens.  The merger has a 96-99% chance of happening and is forecast to occur by the end of this year.  The current share price is equivalent to buying $AMD for $100.  This is not financial advice.
Going to pound town?
They did not. Wish I had seen that report just before close when it was released. I would’ve put everything I had into puts
I’ve been waiting
They actually had a good earnings. Little confused why it’s down
You like paying taxes that much?
Do you have a link to it?
wow a whole dollar?? Im rich!
That’s a dip I’d buy
TWTR 🚀
So….. $HOOD is basically that pillowcase ISIS puts on prisoners before they get beheaded. Fuck me this sucks…
Sideways till end of the week
I would cum so hard

Big smoke and big mirrors
Good
Haven't you learned your lesson by now?  Buy a week out for the earnings pump then sell before earnings
Burn baby burn 🔥
Yeah, WTF is happening?
Expiring when?
Someone just got wrecked after hours on BRK.A
The what now?
nah they went all in on GOOG Puts
I hope the Russians or the Chinese hack the exchange and kill everybody’s portfolio
I'm always so offended by end of day drops
Good. Healthy pull back today for more calls. 

Bulls aint done. It was a 9 day green dildo run.
They sold HOOD to buy BRKA
Spy don’t have earnings so I’m good to go
&gt; I bought some
I'll take SPY at $450 and NVDA at $230, please.
We’re gonna be ok
Dwac gonna be epic
Because most girls worth asking out are already taken.
Stop the count! Hood Won

/u/RealPennyMuncher (1/0) made a bet that CRTX would go to 50.0 when it was 69.4 and it did, congrats retard.
I would just hope that IV drops really quickly.  More quickly than the stock price.
He is selling all his shares
Oh, I see. Thanks for the tip. 🙂
MQ has been going straight up the past week since Citron gave it price target of 50...jfc the fomo
lol I bought AMD and forgot earnings is today.... too late to sell before earnings
FOMC draws nearer.
Did anyone besides me buy LMT calls today? 12/03 $350s
Holy shit brk is buying an owning stake in nvda that’s why it’s up

Why get Spy Puts when you can get TSLA calls not worried a bit 😎
Explain like I’m a downs
"It'll fit" is an excellent motto to have.
BRK.A made me laugh long enough to forget I bough HOOD calls

I doubt it could be a market order since it was after hours but I’m wondering what happened too
I'll get some $AMD calls if it dumps tomorrow because of the usual sell the news. If it doesn't dump I'll simply look elsewhere.
Help, I bought one share of BRK-A and only got one of BRK-B!
AMD crushed earnings, why the fuck is not doing anything?
You sound cute
Some got fat fingered on BRK.A ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Because of them
Twitter saying it's literally three shares sold after hours. Someone just fucked up their limit order loool
HOOD gonna open green tomorrow, AMD also, ah fake and 🌈 always
When is the AMD call? Anybody have a link to it?
I see 3 shares purchased/sold at that price over a 5 minute period.

That’s insane, someone fat fingered that shit.
Rich retard probably did a market order AH. Lol
I'm with ya pal 👍
AMD never pops at earnings, the trick is to sell before earnings, then buy after it sells off, then wait patiently. Which is why I held through earnings like a fucking idiot again, I will never learn.
I'm starting a new subscription service called *Degerate Prime* you send me $11.99 per month. I buy FDs with the money, and keep any and all gains.
Time it right and you can stay up there for a while as a Halloween decoration. You might finally bring someone joy.

Holy fuck RIP GOOGL Bulls 🥺

They're gonna need to average down a little, but Warren will come pick them up in about 4 years.
The fact that you compare HOOD to NFLX FB and TSLA makes me feel bad for your portfolio. Ill send you some red crayons for charting if you'd like.
Microsoft makes me Macrohard
My 5000 shares of Brk A gonna print
Dick Wack?
Who is fucking buying that much shit
Thank god I bought 100 shares of BRK.A before close
Except there’s 10 other companies that offers the exact same thing

Lol someone definitely used Robinhood to buy BRKA after hours
MSFT is like your 60 year old uncle that’s still benches 250 LBS.

GOOGL is still up 70% for the year. That’s insane.
With tech crushing earnings this afternoon, Amazon should run tomorrow before their earnings in the afternoon
$AMD only repurchased 750M$ worth of stock since their announcement of 4B$ Repurchase program. 3,25B$ still left to be repurchased.

As I said before, do NOT buy Chinese ADR dips until Friday. 

For some reason, investors like to act surprised when Evergrande misses a bond payment, and that triggers a selloff.
Micro always Hard never Soft 🥰
Yeah idk where but apparently it was leaked that the drugs they've been working on aren't as effective as they were making it out to be
Always a dead cat bounce might get even more HOOD puts at peak RSI
Something they wear in the Middle East
I’ve been liking thinkorswim, and if I get tired of its wonkiness I can use the main TDAmeritrade site for an old fashioned portfolio view.  Nothin beats fidelity for stock research tho, if you’re into fundamentals, which have not mattered for 6 or 7 years but probably may matter again someray
Seriously how long before people figure out what the name DWAC actually means
Yes, hopefully my put doesn't get iv crushed. Iv was at like 35 percent, so i think i will be fine.
Wow, that was pretty sudden. lol

I chose Twitter, because I didn't expect much to really happen. If something did, it'd likely be up. But, I still went neutral.
#DWAC 50P SELLERS ROLL CALL

who's fucked tomorrow?
HOOD is supposed to be a disrupter it's supposed to be up there with the likes of NFLX FB TSLA and any other stock who permanently changed the climate of an industry. They can really smd at this point bruh
Knock on wood, PINS and SNAP look like they hit a bottom and going up. SNAP was teasing today and PINS looks like it settled and about to reverse. I kiss men and tomorrow I'm hoping to see some numbers go up and turn green.
[deleted]
Ew why is this happening
You don’t think you’ll be fine tomorrow?
Did TSLA do anything yesterday AH?
Someone got robbed on that BRK buy
Berkshire casually up $223,614 per share AH.

Cool cool cool
You actually don’t need dry powder to convert them to spreads.

Say you have a $TSLA $1000c 11/19

To convert to a spread you would sell a $TSLA $1010c 11/19.

The delta is similar on these two so the price per contract will move similarly based on price action.

Can also be done for puts.
Vlad gonna turn off the sell button for hood tomorrow. 

I've never been calmer about my calls
'BIDEN PLAN EXPECTED TO INCLUDE AT LEAST $500 BILLION FOR CLIMATE' -AXIOS

Don’t do that. Just throw your money into SPY Leaps
Vlad should announce that $HOOD will pivot to becoming an EV company.
Short sell the bastards
Bro my heat’s out and I’m eating ramen for dinner. I feel you
HA hit my CRTX ban bet. Just crashed AH
Loading up now for long term potential here
TWTR 🚀
I should have bought the cheapest CRTX puts which were 13 SP I think at about 3.4 per contract. If the trials were good, my shares would have easily covered the cost of those puts. That 3.4 is probably at least 100% gain tomorrow.
Fat finger probably
Someone really wanted those 4 shares of BRKA doe
I was just consoling a friend today (who's a trust fund kid and likes to rib me that he's a better trader than I am even though he literally has 100x my capital and just position trades and has a broker) because he told his broker to sell TSLA at $850 LOL
Same
Shorting TSLA today is like picking up pennies in front of a freight train
I remember one time AMD smashed earnings and it dumped because “guidance”
It is sideways for now
Calm down yall. AH movements are not an indication of anything. Only daytraders and idiots trade after hours.
GOOG Gappin
Drill HOOD Drill. PUTs going to print tomorrow.
Doubtful. Someone’s making money. If you bought PUTs at the right price its down 30% today. 

I want to see porn
See it in TDA too. Rip someone’s gna get fired
They do, but it’s 150 is a massive percentage rise on the company’s valuation
Holy bomb
What if in their quest to bring the financial equities markets to a broader range of people, they in fact created their own demise? While the learning journey never ends, it doesn't take much to realize that maybe you shouldn't blow your stimmy on FDs via a  brokerage that looks, and acts, like a shitty dating startup 

Sort of how like there wouldn't be the ultra hip 3rd wave artisanal coffee without starbucks...a necessary sacrifice for the greater good
I mean honestly at this point I'd be glad to break even on my SPY weekly. Today was fuckin brutal
Excuse me what the fuck
Rebuy after IV crush.
Honestly wonder if you owned that stock if RH would let you sell it at that glitch price.
#PhatPhingers
Stop fucking with options during earnings

These people asking why things go down after good earnings… is this your first time? Sweet innocent virgins, I’ll bring the lube for you
Why the green dildo?
Hahaha, that’s the test they’re using to see who shows their cards so they can fuck with the employees
No loss yet at $14 a share, was a nice dip to average up to $19 a share.
You could see it that way. Or you could see it that last week was the **run up** to this week’s big earnings, which Tesla conveniently surfed on.
See you next week then
twitter puts they said....
I am once again asking for circuit breakers tomorrow for no good reason
last er it went down $2 AH and next day it was up like 7
Someone hit buy instead of sell to crash the market on BRK.A 🥳🥳🥳🥳 markets only go up.
Rip down, you say?
Wtf is BRK.a
I play a vital role. I am a bag man.
Scroll up someone posted the numbers. HOOD lost almost 3million active users. Its pretty bad
I hear the organ trade is lovely this time of year

Yep.  So many of these big moves we're seeing are not coming from WSB/retail at all.

Soo AMD beats and guides above the street? And it's sideways? Come on fam

I knew about this but already lost 8k on spac puts. This was in a Yahoo Finance article about 3 weeks ago.

why do I only dm girls with boyfriends
Truth.
Love seeing HOOD drop. Bitch ass company
Yes. And when that happens, the stock moons hard. That’s why it never happens
All in on XPEV, WISH, BB, PLTR
Hopefully it sells off after the bell. Don't panic if shorts cover and it pops right at the open..

Godspeed brother
HOOD:

"Total funded accounts dropped to 22.4 million, down from 22.5 million at the end of the second quarter. Analysts had expected the user base to rise above 24 million.   
Monthly active users also fell, to 18.9 million from 21.3 million in the second quarter."

We don't take kindly to your kind around these here parts....just kidding. Congrats and fuck you.
It was just a pump and dump. It can't really be your first week here, can it?
I am a fucking genius for going in on MSFT calls god damn
I can't unsee, they really need help over there.
# Don't look under the HOOD
There's only two companies I actively hate, snap and hood. Needless to say I've had fun the past week
shares. 2640
NO volume AH for AMD. We will see what happens during the call.
Crtx HAHAHAHAHA
Which news
EVGO is gonna pop boys and girls👀👀
Huge overreaction AH. Revenue went up and accounts went up
Why though?
Fools who bought at the top too ashamed to emerge from their shanties
TWTR thank you Jack
Sell the news when it happens
that's because it dropped 30% today
SPY 460 eow? I’d like a real meal this month.
Why spy no fly AH?
Looks like I shouldn’t have sold those CRTX 30p…I am fuk
$MLYF  Buying the dip.   Magneseum shortage, China dominance on production and energy rationing, clean technology, domestic production.
🅱️ig dick 🅱️uffett
Oh my god, what the fuck happened to Facebook?
Up $220,000+ in AH but *only* 50%
Nah...he just figured out a way to increase next quarter's profits after seeing all that call premium flowing in.
Fuk. Prog. Dead. Gonna go kill myself. Bye
I don’t think HOOD earnings were that bad.  Definitely worth $35 price tag at minimum
WHY!? Why do you do this to me Mr. Karp :’(
It will open at 470
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
Man, to think the day would come when Intel Inside is actually a sign of a trash computer
Damn that one sucks
Could be the $1.32b loss
:D
Google Facebook and Amazon negate the Microsoft rally for SPY 😬🤞
Damn GOOGL why you do me like that?
Thus concludes the lifespan of a SPAC round WSB
[deleted]
not unless you're selling them AH, which i think is impossible.
some boomer who prob just rolled over their 401k at retirement lololol and got fucked
I bet it's a sandwich
Deposit Withdrawal At Custodian. The literal name of the stock. When supporters are done registering the entire float. You've been trolled folks https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dwac.asp
HOOD puts coming through I hope hit 30
I sure hope!
What are people gonna say if hood turns around and opens at 50+ tomorrow lol.
MSFT long term hodler +1000% now
Lol at that chart.
Sympathy selling after hours similar to FB and TWTR after SNAP earnings.
🤡🤡🤡
My boss keeps telling me about all the great things the company is going to do in the future and I have to smile and nod like I’m not quitting before December
I cashed out at open for a $1400 profit. Bought back in right before close again. Calls exp Friday. 😬
Hood is going straight upward tomorrow
PROG falling hard
Stfu I lost 750k a year an half ago so suck it up you bitch stop gambling
Was hood that bad?
No! You stay away from options, you hear?
🎤 A fortune won and lost on ev'ry deal, All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel 🎶
As if it ever works out that way
Might as well head over to the laundry mat
GOOGL PUTS PRINTING LOLOLOLOL
No. The IV and premiums took care of that
$ME up 2% AH. Watch out noobs
they were flat AH last quarter, dipped in the AM and the moon shot past $100. as long as you dint have weeklies, you’ll be fine tomorrow
Flew too close to the sun 

We will see if it rallies tomorrow
I just don't see how HOOD could be a surprise to anyone. Especially after the bleed up into close.
Pixel 6 Pro
Good time to buy the dip. $370 in January?
If we have already hit bottom today, I should be OK. If it keeps going down, we’ll see. Hopefully it can turn around quicker as it is a buy for “value traders” because of the discount.
All last week and over the weekend it was all about DWAC this DWAC that and now it's all quiet about 🥭🥭🥭 and shit.
or 449
Possibly not. SPY hasn't had a red day since Oct 11. It's due for one
That is an ask price not a bid price.
can ATT get new management already
Real shit do companies ever miss earnings lol
Probably not. Probably would be bad for the android cause the turtleneck would cause the skin grated onto Zucks exoskeleton to melt off
LinkedIN has 800mil users, Twitter is at a paltry 200 mil while FB is at a whopping 2.8 billion users. The only difference over here is that LinkedIn is a part of this giant MSFT.
Dwac closing the gap should bounce
Yeah I had TNDM when it was like $20

I also had like 80 shares of gamestop like 3 years ago
I just put in a 250 billion order
Ooo that one hurts
Wtf lol get better impulses
SPY 10/27 $460c was doing so well this morning and now it’s down bad ffff
Not possible
Why sell for a $2k profit when you can sell for $1k loss?
BREAKING: GOOG HIT AFTER HOURS ON WORRIES OF DECRREASED AD SPEND DUE TO SUPPLY CHAIN COST INCREASES ACROSSS SECTORS - SOURCE: ME
Yeah I moved almost everything to Fidelity a while ago and this was the primary reason why. The graph is total nonsense.
Chart doesn't look great
I caught a homeless-looking man with a cell phone recording girls in their halloween slutty costumes last year. Wonder what I’ll see this year on the subway.
Up like 60% on AMD.  What’s the consensus after the acquisition?  Thinking about selling before the fuckery starts again.
Lmaoooo rip CRTX
You may be. Oh well. It’s just like $1k
There is nothing quite like jabbing a Q-Tip deep into your ear and scratching it dry.  All the "scientists" want to tell you it's bad, but their all the college degrees in the world can't stop me.
You ever just want to hang yourself from the nearest tree? Shit I’ll probably fuck that up too
Loading up on those Microsoft calls I told you about last week
After another convenient delay to OCGN.  Yeah.  WHO totally isn't corrupted.
TWTR remains an enigma to me
$SPY open at $459 tomorrow?
When hyperinflation makes the USD on par with the Zimbabwe $.
Literally never
Lol IV crush gonna fuck everybody either way including me.
Ima need hood to lose 1.3 billion shares
Hoping my 10/29 460$ calls aren’t fucked 😅
That is an ask not a bid...
Don't worry. Unrealized losses are just that: transitory.
Say it ain’t so bruh
wtf afterhours evgo
Yeah that’s what i meant. Brain fart
TWTR is beast
I would so buy this HOOD dip if I wasn’t leveraged to the TITS in FB
+0.71%? That's it AMD? AYFKM?
$OCGN $15 calls made me $1400 at open today. Just bought back in at close. Ready for an easy cash grab at open again.
Do you read the news?
Link?
that's why you don't buy a 400k stock AH
Let's see what happens :3
Same but I got TSLA and FB wrong so im back at even 🤡
Yeah ok pal
Wth happened lol
Yep im good gonna pick up one or 2 a month for a long time.
Hell no. Did you see the IV on them? Every single strike was $20 to breakeven in any direction. Theta gang and IV crush coming for dat ass.
HOOD is literally the worse performing stock in my child's greenlight account
AMD calls getting IV crushed
Yeah and they beat ... what's going on
Hood down 9% while coin less than 1%. How did you figure?
Ban
&gt; I think you mean the other way around. Robin Hood steals money from your pocket and gives it to me, forcing me to hurt the public for my own gain.
pearls before swine
&gt; The game of life is not over.
50%?  Seeing 0%.
I impulsively bought 10 SPY 455p for 10/27 at market close for $1.15. Am I fukd?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Tesla earnings took the steam out of everyone elses
If SPY goes down, sell my last option at a loss, take all my money out of RH and heading over to Coinbase
I still think HOOD is a buy
I sold my late 2021 $70 NET calls for a loss earlier this year.  Doesn't get much more retarded
An ass-simulation, you say? Hmmm
It's a $10 stock in my opinion.
Or if I had not sold 500 AMC shares average buy at $6.40 at a 2.3x gain when Wanda got out?  Yeah...I think about those.
affect is a verb effect is a noun.
Thats what i said.. im fucking retarded
Tf?
$HOOD will rip tomorrow.  Mark my words
If I knew how to short DWAC...  can someone plz explain options to me?
Holy fuck, did someone actually place a market order on BRK.A AH and pay an extra $223,614 for a share?

Multiple feeds saying this is real
Ah fuck, I'm gonna lose a lot of money tomorrow
Well fuck, I guess AMD earnings were already priced in after all…
Does he have what it takes for the legendary black turtleneck?
yeah, massive volume too.

F for my 460c Friday SPY
Seriously nothing matters until open.
Aaaand its ded
Gotta be a glitch right?
I wanted to buy Spotify puts for tomorrow morning's earnings but the volume was non existent. like seriously a volume of 2????
Sometimes you have to sit through allot of bad hands at the casino to finally get the big win.
seriously. best earnings of the day and the market doesnt care. wont even talk about it on cnbc
lol that's exactly what I bought EOD

I feel like a genius selling Robinhood at $50 now
Wtf
Robinhood revenue jumped 30% third quarter.

Ok so stock tanks 🤡
[deleted]
Apparently the DWAC bagholders didn’t attend Trump University.  They definitely would have seen this coming
Everyone waiting on the call to hear about real news
AMZN gonna tank 10% again on Friday. Mark it. Get your puts ready...
buying more AMD tomorrow. just wait til XLNX merger 🚀🚀🚀
I already blew it for this $4.
Zoom out. It’s up 25% in October alone.
When will DWAC hit $500?
Anyone who invests in that trash gets what they deserve.

Ditto for DWAC.
I am sure glad I sold my hood calls right before the closeing bell today.
BAHAHAHA
Alright good joke Vlad.
Volume: 4
it's OK AMD. it was a solid beat. you can moon when you are ready
Never look if you cash out
HOODwinked!
Are you dumb? I live in california its 1 29 pm right now

I held my 10/29 $315 calls and felt nauseous going into earnings😅 but looks like these diamond hands will pay off🤲🏽💎💎
You are the biggest idiot in here. You are wasting your money trying to get a 10x
earnings are out, beats everything and raises guidance
A good way to turn $175 dollars into $55 dollars in two days
Always buy puts on earnings. It will either dump because of bad revenue, or dump because of stake holders taking profit after good revenue
Take that to buy a 4 for 4 at wendys before your shift instead of blowing it
Can amd go up a bit more please
Gondor calls for aid!! 🔥
Anyone who lost money on TSLA today go check out r/DWAC_Stock it will pick up your spirits.

ya of course, but that would mean someone just wants in so bad that they purchased at a 225K price increase?
lol check the volume dude.

Glad I dumped hood eod

I am new but I like the long game with LCID. Going to compete with tesla and elon is ragging on them. Good for a long hold?   What do yall think?
Idk FB was 340 AH and look what happened today
Hood is fakkk
Same, I have about 9% of my portfolio in MSFT. Had cash to bump it up to like 13-14%, should’ve done it.

Oh well, can’t bitch about gains
Why, what's happening?
Came within $3 of that today. I think you’ll be ok
Lisa is everybody's auntie when earnings come around

Oh wow you bought at $149. You’re well fucked.
Who TF would sell amd after those earnings? Imagine growing your company 65% in a year and then some boomer decides to sell after amazing earnings. Nah. 

I see a nice day tomorrow ending at $150.

Lol boomer who follows that stock
Yeah wtf?
sorry, this earnings season so far
Previous Q eps: 0.11

Expected Q eps: -1.36  
Actual Q eps: -2.06

"Our expectations were low for you but HOLY FUCK"
Just a 10% drop for Hood.
It’s my birthday tomorrow and for my birthday I’d like DWAC to come back from the dead 😳
I have been burned by this exact strategy in the past.  It can, in fact, keep falling
TSLA 200p Dec 17th exp are an absolute no brainer. Only cost $4.
Funny robinhood helps all these huge hedge fund fuckers and MMs but they dump his stock. 😂 fuck my calls.
$GNUS
Holy Shit, HOOD is showing BRK A at $661,504

I think that means someone actually bought at that price or it's just a glitch, but still crazy. That's $230k a share over what it was trading for. Could you imagine blowing $230k because you pushed the wrong button like a retard.

Edit - correct spelling because I pushed the wrong button like a retard.
i see what you've done here.
Sue Bae is the only bae
Yup
Perfect, thanks.  I will grab some more shares.
Nice little jump for MSFT. Might grab calls this week if I can.

But if you had calls going into earnings, you’re gonna lose money. 1-2% isn’t nearly enough to escape The Crush.
Waiting for Facebook to go down to $300
You ever go back and look at past plays to see what would’ve happened if you held? For example, I bought Corsair $35 11/20/20 calls on 9/23/20 and sold 9/26/20 for a loss- Corsair ran up more than 100% in the couple weeks after that. 

I’m literally retarded.
Hood was obvious, Twitter I did not expect
I bought weekly SPY 456 puts right before close. I’ve got a feeling
Poor my 15 HOOD shares.
Please god I'm down 30% in my portfolio almost entirely on 460c spy I need this
The earnings hasnt even been released yet, it is set for 2pm PST or 5pm EDT
Welcome to modern life, looks are everything
But why would the crush trigger? Wouldn't we be able to close in the morning?
Bro.... look at what early investors paid. They literally had people buying at 20/share in a private offering early in the year and then dumped it on retail at 37/share 3 months later. The bottom is probably 20/share.
R.I.P.  Ocgn.  More bagholders.  Follow the patterns.  It rockets up fast then drops faster

AH is fake and gay. Tesla and NFLX had about the same reaction. Then went to the moon the next day. TBH it's probably best to ignore any market action outside of regular market hours.
What do you mean? You bought puts?
Whenever somebody uses the word "impact" I assume it's because they don't know the difference between effect and affect

The reason I assume this is because I don't know the difference between effect and affect, so I use impact
Looks like $HOOD taking $COIN down with it. Hate to see it.

MSFT has a too large share of boomer investors. Stock should be way higher imo.
HOOD tanking AH. You can bet your ass Cathie will buy the shit out it tomorrow.
For sure brother. The IV is still super high but there's no buyers stepping up and the "news" is pushed back now with no date in sight. 

I'm holding $10.5p myself.
Zuck needs to go into gray t-shirt mode
Because you can’t predict earnings, it’s random. Could have amazing earnings and still go down.
Earning season seems to be less forgiving today.
Good time to take some profits folks, my puts need to print
Lol HOOD
Consider inversing yourself

This market is retarded. I bought DWAC at 104 and now its down nearly 50%. I just bought Robinhood calls right before the market closed and now its down like 10% in after hours even though their earnings were not bad.
It spiked up before close!!!!
Fuck at this point I might consider buying some HOOD.  I meant it can't keep falling, can it?
Any guesses as to why GOOG isn’t moving up after killer earnings?
if ur stock doesn’t have a P/E RATIO, or its over 100


it could go down a lot

We’ll see. A lot of time between now and open tomorrow. Options don’t move AH so still praying the momentum stays strong
It's probably set up for an Amazon earnings induced drop Friday
We forget. Market moves on. Suddenly, we remember. All poo leaves body.
AMD is not really moving much AH, so maybe hold the excitement

What was your bet?
Probably for the best ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Didn’t get too excited retards, remember what happened to Facebook
Microsoft, AMD, bring SPY TO ATH!!!
If you bet on HOOD you deserve to lose money
this is tech’s world, the rest of the industries are just living in it
If AMD confirms minimal impact from chip shortage, TSM will start a new ascent to 120’s.
HOOD down 10%
65% revenue growth trading at a 45x multiple is a good deal people. Just because it’s trading at ATH does not mean it is overvalued
You can convert them into a spread to semi-lock in gains if you’re forced to hold them over night
Along with my dignity for some reason
Love this stock. It has been canceling out my FB losses with its retard strength the past couple weeks.
Tomorrow $MSFT &amp; $GOOGL traders are all going to sell at open highs causing another $SPY drop! 📉
I should have held through earnings I knew it would launch but never have held through and was afraid of IV crush
Iv crush fam
FB calls? $317.50 / $320 calls for Nov. 19exp.

I’m an idiot but I think it will go back up! 

At least it will reverse the -4% it did today, and I’m buying calls close to ITM with some time on them. People are going to value buy this shit because this dip is like buying in at April 2021 prices.
I finally got enough money for TSLS calls and within 2mins that shit fell off a cliff. $9k be circling the drain next Friday.
Not 5 PM yet
Just remember, cat food is edible, you just need to heat it up slightly to maximize the texture and flavor.

Wtf twtr with a pop all of a sudden here I thought my covered calls are safe lol
MSFT 😍😍😍
Pro Max
You lost those too?
Vlad you raped my portfolio again
THANK YOU SU BAE
Results good
My bet is that it will sink to 30/share over the next week. All pre-ipo investors are still up huge. They will start cashing out.
Ever since papa mad Ella has taken over, MSFT has soared
Damn I don’t want to beat a dead horse, but DWAC is really giving it up easy.

Fucking Puts printing yet for anyone??
I hope so, would like my $8000 gains back that vaporized after SPY went to lunch today.
MSFT got 13 of those shares few weeks ago. Shoulda loaded the boat

Microshafts shaft isn’t so micro after all
But it just shot to 63
DRILL TEAM SIX ENGAGING HOSTILITIES ON CALL SIGN ROBINHOOD
Bought SPY 458C at close, means it'll be red by open
Yes
i have learned over time when i feel fearful like it's time to exit pretty much every time you should buy and hold on. profits are for enormous spikes up, that's not time for FOMO that's time to consider cashing out a percentage. my 0.02.
holy shit. i dont get twtr. its such a shit stock and performed shit but still managed to crush my puts
Market was pricing in bad earnings/tech sell off. Should gap up tomorrow i presume
my msft may take me out the poorhouse 🥴
GME.
RIP $INTC, you outdated boomer POS of a company with shitty CPUs and even shittier GPUs.  Long live $AMD and blessed be Lisa Su our Silicon Lord of the future.   I pray in profit's name, amen.
AMD the only thing hard carrying my spy and nvda calls. Don't let me down
LETS GO SU BAE!!!! $0.75 EPS, YOU BEAUTIFUL ASIAN PENG TING!!
In other words, every day since IPO has been a crushing defeat for Apes
20
10/29 $9 puts am I gonna be happy?
Only Su Bae can save you
He don't care. As long as the stock stays above $3 by the time he gets to sell he's plenty rich.
If you don't have to pay any taxes on long term gains over a year shouldn't the IRS pay us back for long term losses over a year lol.
What’s more retarded: buying GME at $480 or 🥭 at $175?
Shocked. 👏
13 Pro or 13 Pro Max
MSFT 315 just won my Ban Bet. Can I get a flair?
Bought puts last week... breakeven was 37.50 with November expiration. I am going to be up bigly.
Yeah, the interest on shorting was like 87% APR
dear 8lbs 6oz newborn baby Jesus...
Depends if the big tech players hold their earnings gains, though TSLA momentum could swing it either way
HOOD about to hit the same price as IPO day. Get fucked Vlad.
Well this Robinhood music for the earning call is atleast calming as it’s fucking me
Can anyone comment on the totally broken robinhood main money graph? It's not even close to representing my investments over time, how come nobody has fixed this?

Hood entry point at $29
HOOD is the new SNAP

Glad I picked AMD over HOOD. I did consider it for a second. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
$IONQ something about Quantum computing with Goolge and Amazon invested in them.
But do you enjoy it at least?
it went up
Dayumn, Microsoft killed it again. Glad I got MSFT calls instead of GOOG
Word is a fake report that said SoftBank dumped 75% of their shares. Turns out it was a different stock
upvote if HOOD green by open
Fake story about a bank selling their shares.
Su Bae &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
every earning season :“fuck it’s been three months already?”


i can’t be the only one
Imagine having all your money tied up in a 🥭 pump and dump while Tesla rallies
Compare its market cap to Coinbase’s. Now compare its earnings to Coinbase’s. Paints a picture.
Zero day trades left. Praying over my SPY and TSLA calls overnight.
Like on what wtf are there expenses besides the halt machine
I know nothing about Corsair, but I do know that no one can buy a decent graphics card for love nor money, which is what usually prompts people to upgrade other pc components. Someone may have a better theory but that would be my guess.

AMD has amazing fundamentals.
wow twitter gone stupid mode
Just google $HOOD earnings call or look somewhere under their ticker on your broker

AMD save me
own 26 41.5P for Nov 5/11. I am eating steak tonight.
If it stays where it is at now it is past the equilibrium so puts are making money.
Oof. F for you, my brother
Drop another dollar HOOD, my Puts ITM now! Greedy want more!
that spy sell off was fucking brutal. any chance we gap up pre market?
Right?  Now I finally know the words.
Lololol 🤣 keep coping this thing will be single digits a year from now. Dog coin was the absolute peak of the retail frenzy it’s all downhill from here. And they couldn’t even turn a profit at the peak 😂🤣 this company is literally going to go bankrupt eventually
🤡
From vlad the impaler, to vlad the impaled
Im seeing ghosts like sam darnold
I wonder if Bulgaria prepared Vlad for such disappointment.
INTC is gonna get ton of free $$ from Biden admin as part of infra bill so playing both AMD and intc
HOOD is dumping 🤣🤣🤣
Anyone know why SOFI got hit so hard today? Any news or simply correcting from a bull run?
Vlad is going back to Bulgaria with earnings like this
🚀HOOD🚀. 

Great buying opportunity

AMD up 2%
Use Google or your broker lol
SPY +1% day tomorrow
AMD is like the inverse INTC; smash earnings and moons
It only takes less than 50% of your Robinhood portfolio being in HOOD shares now to own your portion of Robinhood as far as I can tell

Was at like 60% a month ago so this is a way better deal
🙏please Lisa su grant us thy tendies amen🙏

AMD $150 tomorrow.
Is iv worth it? How much you paid for what strike?
Nah. Dick gets hard ya know?
Visa crushed it but I bought my 240c a day too early. Let's see if it hits.
May Lisa suBAE bless us toDAY
Is my $130 AMD ban bet safe… prolly not. Still happy doe
I'm sure IV crush will still ruin HOOD puts

Sold puts, got handed my ass, bought them back quickly . Only lost $200, could have been a lot more
Msft can only go up from here bous
Rip hood calls
HOOD with the casual 1.3 billion dollars loss. No biggie!
Lol at Intel bulls looking at PE ratio. All you gotta do is trust in Sue Bae
F
definitely not. It will fall back to 115 over the next few weeks and then shoot back to 140 @ next earnings :\\ just amd things
AMD needs to stop teasing and get above $130
COUNTRY ROOOAAADDDDS
My most confident long term plays in this economy are utilities and energy companies. All of which I ain’t own individually atm. Anyone have any recommendations on ETFs besides VDE or VPU?
Why google no go up? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

I hope that guy who was “leveraged to the tits” on HOOD is doing okay 😧😧😧

Breaking news. Vlad bought puts and will restrict buying on HOOD in the AM.
Thank god I only have one AMD put but 8 MSFT calls
AMD not moving more than 2% inany direction
DWAC puts printing. Thank you 🙏 Donnie Pump
This is the top boys, finally bought SPY calls end of the day and already down over 50%. Expect a -3% day tomorrow
Need Visa to pump to ATH tonight and tomorrow 😭😭
Lol Corsair is a shitty fucking company, how can you loose 50 percent of revenue in 5 months
if it hits $2 i'm buying it
Watch it drill tomorrow anyway
Looking like my Puts will print instead of my Calls
[deleted]
For real. So tired of people commenting calls will print tomorrow. Atm calls aren't even past break even.
Lol same
Miss big on EPS and Revenue miss was bad but not that bad
Funniest thing was you were bragging in the previous thread before close. That clown flair is fitting
Holding these HOOD bags I got from selling hood puts![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Small cap rally into EOY. Any holds people are excited about?
still an overvalued POS
The hood earnings call music is a vibe
When is this fucking bear market going to turn around?
Is it me or does AMD literally always destroy earnings?
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/drdarkpiccolo (0/2) made a bet that BB would go to 12.0 when it was 11.24 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Fuck me that's something. 3K members already.
What happened to NVDA today?
I own $0.78 of it but it's dropped enough that I might pick up a real position in it
AMD all over the place
I'm losing my mind.... and reaping all the benefits!!!
Damn so robinhood is just a really bad stock huh
Like 1.3B loss
AMD increase guidance to $4.4B-4.6B. Beat on revenue and EPS.
Love it.

AMD KILLED THEIR ER!!!!! YEAH!!!!! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
AMD operating income doubled YOY. Up 50% YOY revenue. Nice.
You don’t buy credit spreads you sell them
Large scale corporations update their subscription yearly in bulk then turn around and write it off on taxes. Another one of those infinite money glitches.
AMD acting a little bi polar
Value stock rotation is upon thee
Same here. I stupidly wanted to keep ipo access and didn't sell.
Looks like my AMD calls were finally on the right side of earnings!
I’ve never seen such a theta gang win like today. Apart from robinhood. Fuck you robinhood
DIE $HOOD DIE DIE DIE
Dwac closed $59 will get 50% hair cut tomorrow

everything I read last 48 hours anticipated a pop after earnings and now it seems the majority sentiment I’m seeing is bearish. I really hope the guys who were predicting AMD to rocket are right

So who's going to buy my HOOD 45c at open

1.32 billion loss for HOOD.

What did people expect? Before last year Robinhood profits were depending on their large base and margin users, but when the last 1.7 years had 30%+ of their users in exodus's going to other platformers, especially later after amc and gme, there was no longer enough base to work around the losses.

I estimate $23-25 is Robinhood current real value for the time being. Expect more dipping
Hood should never have gone public. They were way more powerful without the extra visibility

So many people talking shit about DWACK yet yoloed into OCGN the last 2 days lmfao get fucked
Dawg I’ve never seen price action like this.
Thx
the fact that TSLA is in the $1 Trilly club is hilarious in looking how much money the other Trilly club members are printing and making each quarter

Holding PROG for a nice gain at $10+
Jack Dorsey blaming the lack on ad spent on hyperinflation? Suprised TWTR didn't collapse here. Lol
Still waiting for AMD
FUCK
Sell on the snooze, live and burn.
I went from eating shrimp at a swanky hotel to the back of the Wendy’s dumpster in a span of two days
That’s what I’m sayin
HOOD LMFAO
They are just waiting for AMD huh
should have bought those HOOD puts  😔
LOL HOOD is recovering
Had a dream Elon took me to dinner. I’m ducking ghey
HOOD 🤣
[deleted]
If you didn't buy OCGN puts then you don't like free money. 

That stock ALWAYS gives back its gains
And the big bois flow out of TSLA and back into MSFT and GOOGL ♻️
So many people here bough HOOD before the earnings… this sub keeps getting dumber and dumber huh
Yeah I’m a fan of Dune

Dune your mom
Larger size can’t read
Hood wrecked. Just like we like it.

Will Google ever do a stock split?

Ya'll were pissed at HOOD for fucking you in Jan and you still buy?

Wtf is wrong with you.

Yeah, fuck having a portable laptop that overheats and freaks out easily. I’ll trade off portability and lightweightness for POWER. Been running for an hour and the fans have yet to kick in. Pure bliss.

Not released yet
Very healthy of you.
AMD slow on the earnings.
If you bought calls when TSLA peaked today; congratulations you played yourself
You also said HOOD calls were free money 😐
Oh shit who coulda seen HOOD tanking
[deleted]
Oh nooo lol
Imagine not yoloing into HOOD puts 2 mins before close
DWAC better drill tomorrow
If any of you are into short reports $MP got murdered today after breaking out the past few days. Company just posted on their Twitter about earnings being on 11/4

Who the fuck is Grizzly Research anyway?
Bags, you bought bags.
What’s does this mean, is the estimates for tomorrow earnings?
lol twitter amd msfT

barely pumping so far
Hood below ipo might buy 1 share
SPY gotta dump $10 tomorrow or I’m so fucked
HOOD just got wrecked, bad day for Vlad
Dumbest noobs in the market
Did amd beat??
$TSLA  to $1200 so I can recover from the $DWAC bullshit. And I found a $1 stock that helped me.
Ok AMD your turn

Damn we’re prolly gonna have a +2% day on the nasdaq
thank fuck i actually didnt go full retard
DWAC stock sub is just sad stuff. Ya hate to see it
HOOD: Warns earnings wont be as great weeks ago.


HOOD release sucky earnings.

Call holders: Pikachuface.
Wouldn’t any stock trading near it’s ATH have more investors in the green than GME, which is nowhere near it’s ATH? Where do you get this stat from, I see you saying it here all the time
Same
$BB
I got a call on msft just before close so even if they beat earnings it's of course gonna tank by tomorrow morning.
$ROPE FOR ME NOT SELLING $PINS AT $65.
Everything I read is positive earnings news. Plus last earnings didn’t AMD go from $95 to $125? 

Fuuuuuuuck. Goddamnit I should have sold when I was up big this morning. Same with SPY

Edit: AMD $130C exp 11/5 &amp; AMD $160C exp 11/19
Msft to 340
Same wow I’m only down 15% instead of 90%
Lmaoooooo HOOD tards BTFO again lol imagine holding that trash 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣

Su Bae where are you baby
Imagine if Elon made SpaceX a public company. The stock market would propel its own way to mars. And Elon net worth would be 1 trillion.
You were considering hood calls going into these earnings??? Were you dropped on the head as a baby?
But casinos give you prizes for showing up... And this is a casino, ergo what do I get?
TWTR swinging wildly, bears and bulls alternating between ecstasy and despair
thats it?
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
now I am sad I only got one HOOD put.
Yeah it was manipulated all afternoon.  The entire market was dipping for an hour straight and spy refused to give up 457 (until right before the bell after the big boys managed to close their positions).
Chill out dawg Jesus

Lol rip OCGN
&gt; I think so.
TWTR price movement is on cocaine right now
My dude, when you went from 150 to 100, why not close your positions and enjoy your winnings?
Lol
Could’ve been up like 250% on TSLA calls today but held and sold them later for -30%
I made money today, but not as much as I could've, feels bad
Thank god i bought more ocgn puts to hedge my HOOD calls 😂😂😂
I just devoured 8 chicken wings it was good. Now back to my losses.
Come on MSFT and GOOG, please be clutch

Oh, my sweet summer child…
Gona buy more MARK. To bring my average down. And hope to recoup some of the loses ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I'm looking for some help trying to understand warrants, for example looking at BRPMW I read the investors relation page and found that the right to exercise a contract at 11.50, but I cant tell when it expires would it be the date in the ticker description (01/03/2028)
Freed up 2k to yolo into something. any thoughts?
I’m convinced that clov doesn’t have a bottom
tomorrow’s gonna hurt
lol @ the clown who bragged about recommending HOOD was a buy yesterday.
Double down on OCGN calls and wait for November 3rd like a retard probably
$HOOD earnings big oof
same. ofc i did to top off an already horrible day
$TWTR posted shitty earnings
twitter cumming itself rn
Deposit Withdrawal At Custodian
vlad go back to bulgaria ffs
I bought three calls for $7 at the close. Definitely selling tomorrow if it pops. Already up 50%
Lol if you're not fucked, I'd be shocked. I'm holding my contract through earnings but I've already got 120% unrealized gains on it and plan to hold it until at least next May...
HOOD LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hood ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
YES google
Haha HOOD just bent me over
Gunna watch QQQ open near ATH and then break right through it.
The bright side here is I only bought HOOD shares, not calls
Yeah not looking good with how the day went
A little dramatic
Buy Gold Bond options
Wait people where expecting good earnings? Even if there was has nobody picked up on the not so hidden trend of most companies dumping after earnings regardless good or bad. Companies still need product to sell and labor to produce and that all seems to be in short supply lately.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Fuck this day! Up 150% at one point only to finish up 7%. Never been more pissed off at a 7% gain. Probably losing everything tomorrow cause my dumbass is holding everything overnight.
Finally got one right…. Back to even again 🤡
Wrong sub bruh
Already bought 😄
#I TOLD YOU TO BUY TWITTER PUTS YOU BITCH

GUESS WE SAW WHATS REALLY UNDER THE HOOD HAHAHA
Count me in.

Just bought $60P at the close.
There goes my Hood shares.
Suddenly SPY had a near $3 drop right as we were entering closing.

I always suggest selling the etfs that go until 4:15 by no later than 3:45 myself. 3:50 max.
HOOD lmfao!  

Too bad there were 0 shares available to borrow, couldn't play this one. Puts too expensive. 🤷‍♂️
DWAC stop falling? Buy more?
LFG Microsoft, SPY give me $460+ open w dems bills
why did I fucking listen to you guys about hood calls. smh

I actually almost bought a handful of HOOD calls until I realized that was probably retarded and I should just stick to my original earnings play.
holy shit twitter pick a side
HOOD 🤣💀
Holy shit now that’s a beat MSFT 🚀
how does everyone who loaded up on HOOD calls feel rn?
vlad needs to charge kenny more
earnings no bueno
After two weeks of going up almost every day? Who could have foreseen the market could have one bad afternoon following a 100$ runup on Tesla and a 10$ runup on AmD?
I bought hood at close. Well fuck.
Wtf is going on with Twitter
Puts finna print
Who bought HOOD puts during that last minute spike before close 

Because I fucken didn’t 🤡🤡
95% of GME investors are in the green. Literally any other stock has more bagholders

Realistically all the bad news for Hood should be priced in…..
Huge miss on hood

I was having such a great day. Then impulsively, I bought HOOD calls right at close. Fuck me with a pineapple.

I was wondering why people were buying late... but figured it'd dump.
Shoulda sold hood at eod fml
Probs a few hundred percent up
Fucked us both bud haha

Robinhood is going back to where it belongs.
Shewwwwe Microsoft smoked earnings. Next up is Amazon.
Looks like HOOD turned off the buy button again, RIP my calls ☠☠☠☠☠
Apes are cringe enough normally, but do you ever see someone post something so bad you think it must be ironic?

And then you look at the username and it ends with -84 or something, indicating the person was probably born in the 1980s.

And you realize... this motherfucker is about to hit 40 years old, and to this point, their life has been so empty and their understanding of the market so nonexistent, that adopting this into their personality was the only move.

If I just described you I want you to know... I love you and appreciate that you keep buying the calls I'm selling.
Why HOOD dumping 😐
Small, poor boy from Bulgaria
Hood you piece of shit
You’re not alone. We stand together.
clowns decides to buy $hood calls into earnings
Yea, was def not expected. Also not expected, VIX being green all day after the morning SPY dump.
Long $ROPE f me![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
probably not, hope that bag aint too heavy!
Bought more FB. This is a cash machine
What a fucked up day. Hopefully these PLTR calls bring me glory.
#I TOLD YOU

Holy moly Microsoft. What a beat.
Chickened out sold my AMD calls, opened a pretty wide IC, and a crazy OTM debit spread in case they blow to like 135+ to cover my IC losses.
It makes sense to close the daily thread of new comments after close. But I don't agree with all. Comments. Existing conversation trees that are sometimes in depth or educational just kind of stop due to that. I think conversations should be allowed to continue and only new full comments are locked imo.
Hood wrecked
LOL HOOD
what's happening?

That was a hard Tesla spike to catch. Not in terms of short time. Just hard to sell. If it goes up another couple dollars it’s thousands or tens of thousands more profit. Hard to cap that off.

I sure fucking hope so, I need a win. Holding a couple 11/5 455p and I was wayyy underwater on them for a couple hours there, just about broke even after that last dump
Should’ve just sold when I was up 48% in the morning instead of bagholding like a bitch
Same here pray for some overnight gains

Why does SPY always pull of this EOD shit man ☹️
You and me both! Praying for a comeback tomorrow xD

Market dumped for no reason last 15 minutes so I loaded up some IWM calls a couple weeks out; we'll see what happens.

I suppose we should expect some rockiness next week due to Fed meeting/tapering announcement, but everybody already expects an aggressive tapering so I don't think it'll be too bad.

Probably just a lot of rotation (which is why I'm favoring IWM/small caps right now).
I thought I was going to be rich until noon. Still broke

Two of them, but they keep me busy af
apparently not for dash üòë
With RIVN and F riding tomorrow 

Can at least someone cue the trumpets for TESLA
Gay
None. Go to your sub imbecile
In a hyper-inflated market, yes
‚ÄúYes I would like to make the same bet. Except the ticker is different, the starting price is different, the target price is different, and the date is different.‚Äù
That isn't how this works. If you make 100k on a trade then lose it on the next you don't pay tax as long as it's the same tax year.
Better be buying some COST shares as a thank-you for the tip.
And if u don‚Äôt wanna program?
How close to $0 are my DASH 185 puts going to be tomorrow? They can't be zero but they gotta be close.. $1,200 was the gamble.
The last time I got fucked this hard I got a thank you from the priest
*You mean Tesla
Which üåΩ miner do we like?
Musks tweets screwing over his base. Dump that shit.
Remote I guess ir hybrid
Only if you can get reasonable fill prices at open.
Imma buy puts on everything
Jesus christ i got absolutely fucked today. NIO down 6% and dropping even more after earnings, PLTR down 10%. Like, i can't catch a break with the stocks these days. Every time PLTR and NIO starts to build up some momentum all the profit is suddenly gone in a day.
I bought them Thursday. I am sad.
$ELY   
\-3Q adj EPS $0.14 vs est $0.09

choose the one that does programming
So is it a rule for most stocks to simply drop 10% after earnings regardless of results ?
People seem overly bearish on SoFi. Calls it is
i won't
This hurt just to read
I only trade put credit spread because of this reason. lmao fuck gay bear
ü§Æ
Today was a pretty green red day?
Are these positions remote or must be in office?
*humming intensifies*
Only insiders get the IPO price.
&gt; You can, but it won't be as good.
Puts on amd
Yes on the drinks. Forgot to get my whisky sour while playing.
PLUG is almost recovered?  WTF?  It would be awesome if U could do the same thing.
But why can't I just bring my own lifelike mustache ?
Biz analyst. Easiest and you get good pay.
If it dips double digits, absolutely
I like dudes not chicks
So TSLA $1,200c 11/19... I feel like I fucked up majorly.
I know a place that can give you a lone. Up something...
Tech jobs make 6 figures sitting down and most likely didnt do anything for the day while the tradees lift 100 lbs on their back every second and making $20 bucks an hour sometimes $45 depending how hard they work.
Just don't rent a corvette and drive 156mph on city streets with a hooker in the car.

okay um If I want to play Afirm Puts Strike 140 135?
Show your pp on Instagram next bro show her who‚Äôs the bossüòé
Boy, I sure fucked up with my dash forecast. Tesla falls on Twitter rumors and shitty companies with unoriginal business models rally on subpar earnings. ü§¨
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)Dash pls stahp ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
By selling a call against your shares you‚Äôve capped your gains at the strike price. But youre also tied to those shares for the length of the contract even if the price goes down in the short term. If it spikes later above your strike, your shares will get called away and if you don‚Äôt have them, you‚Äôll need to buy them at whatever market value is or buy an itm call which could be expensive later on especially if IV rises. If you sell a call and sell your underlying, there is unlimited downside. You could lose waaaayy more than the price of the shares. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trading options for a year‚Äù but it sounds like you still don‚Äôt really understand them. Not understanding options is a great way to lose money.
IRS will only let you deduct $3k per year from losses. If you raked in a shit ton more than $3k in capital gains before you lose it, good luck my boy!
oh shit. I kind of forgot FUBO was a meme stock for a bit...
Upst pulled an Amazon move üòÇü§°
Need that shit to bounce tomorrow
BITCHES SHOWING ME THEY CLEAVAGE

- UPST BEARS RIGHT NOW
Same F calls should see a nice pop
Getting absolutely destroyed by dash
Product owner or manager
I keep telling myself, "I'm just gonna keep throwing money into the account every paycheck and save up to have a big chunk of change to play with so I don't bleed to death" but everytime I end up "hmm we can probably scalp some nice plays here" balance stays the same, losses keep stacking up.
lol the poshmark earnings call is hilarious


*analysts asks question*

ceo *whispers to guy next to him*: "Do you have that data?"
Sub $14.
For COIN, guidance will be decisive. Everyone knew Q3 was slow but things are heating up now. Wait till the call before planning your moves.
‚ÄúPLTR Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) reported quarterly earnings of $0.04 per share which met the analyst consensus estimate.‚Äù  

Exactly what I said, what are you arguing?
AFRM puts before earnings
Super smart
Lmfao I got redirected to chegg's website when downloading Security Analysis pdf.
Might drop regardless of earnings. But for the longrun will be well worth the wait
The cult drank some special kool-aid
Hmu with that insta
Open spreads my man
Put Credit Spread Fam. -$9.5k but aint realized loss till expiration. Tesla stay above $1100 so I can flip my $9.5k loss to $7k realize profit at EOM. LFGGGGGG......!
Had the money to burn but man it fucking hurts.
Whenever SPY has a red day, I just keep buying more long calls

Can‚Äôt lose
What's that in terms of the highs before the drop?
Lol
inside voice please
What is "where did my money go?"
Lets go buddy!
Probably close to 6k. Should get official numbers later tonight.
Congrats and fuck DASH dudes
It's GOLDEN

5. Cloud admin

What would you choose in terms of 6 figure easy life easy job
whats her instagram?
You‚Äôre wrong
Not directly. Sitting on a couple hundred F calls though.
RBLX is the safest buy rn. Nancy Pelosi doesn't lose money
Might fuck around and buy some SPY monthlies if it dips tomorrow.

accidentally bought a upst 11/19 call for $900
I worked in defense and my ‚Äúwork‚Äù was classified while theres were not.
Last Friday I was at Costco, and I saw a big display for Roblox gift cards.  I thought to myself "Really?  Roblox gift cards?"

RBLX 12 NOV $100c up 3,000% today, and the stock closed at an all-time high.  

So yeah.  Really.

I still have faith in a tumble tomorrow. I have time on mine though.
NUGT was a pretty good hedge for me today. Sold 5 poots on my IRA account but didn't have it on my trading account. Will have to do so in the future.
Yup
I have literally 0 faith Tesla will dominate the EV market, they are already losing EV market dominance. They are trash cars. The interior feels so cheap and they look very generic. I can't even wrap my head around how they are worth more than pretty much all the largest manufacturers combined. 1% global market share, definitely a trillion dollar company.
Gunner bitch? You ain‚Äôt a bow and arrow
&gt; I'm not really sure. I think it will dump a little bit, but that's about it
I‚Äôll try it
Bruh, my first job out of college paid more than that

I feel bad for the people buying RBLX at the top. Shit is just a fad. Lol
The nasdaq has increased over 100% covid lows
How bad is SOFI gonna dump tomorrow in AH? I‚Äôm scared
UPST dip being bought up by tutes. got a starter swing of 100 shares for 234.11
According to their holdings data (which was updated today): TSLA makes up 10.81% of their ETF, COIN 6.32%, and U 5.45%.
Great, so both CNBC and Cramer have hailed Ford. New all time low tomorrow
Imagine being a retard like you
#UPST WILL DROP TO -35% TOMORROW OPEN
Sorry, unless you sold some. Then grats
Buy the dips.... FUBO baby!
how do *you* feel about it
Why did I hold nio shares through earnings
Most retarded thing ever, while SPCE is up too
Yeah but it still pisses her off
Welcome to the stock market where 60% of the time, it makes no sense all the time
I sold it last sec
[deleted]
The moment when you realized you are actually considering either all in Calls or all in Puts at the same time to a stock‚Ä¶you‚Äôre pretty much fked
The other day ordered stuff from Macy's. 2 hours delivery with.... doordash. Then I realized,  DASH also competes with ups/fedex. Bullish
I losr enough in 2019-2020 for a tax deduction for at least another 136 years.
Why
Beware the ides of corn.
Who else buying the COIN dip tomorrow
Most people in tech don‚Äôt do shit so yes
Raped by UPST. Bought at $333.
She ain‚Äôt even worth the time or effort bro. Go rub 3 out, and swipe on grindr
Aerotyne International
Revenue growth doesn't matter if costs are increasing proportionally.
UPST shit the bed, dragging everyone down
Calls for ford
Im balls deep in SOFI and already got absolutely railed by PYPL, UPST. not excited...
how many entries into the main this year?
I agree with the banking and federal deposit reform. I believe it is a market that will need to be tapped into in an attempt to balance all the money printing; which I think lawmakers are slowly starting to realize.
AFRM puts now - this shit has to dump too
AFRM puts or calls tomorrow?
RIP purple gang, this looks like a fatal blow
There with ya! Let‚Äôs shock the world tomorrow
That was me three months ago except my entire team was remote while I HAD to be 100% in office. Fuck that company
That‚Äôs hella bullish for banbets lifespan
God I hope so I have Nov 19 115p x 10
Nah I made money on TSLA puts today. And hella money on LC shares/calls earlier this year. I‚Äôm just advocating being a little bisexual is all.
You at the rio?
when they continue to dilute shares that's what you get
Anyone else do 0 work for their remote tech job and then on the resume and linkedin they write shit like ‚Äú

1. ‚Äúdeployed X data to snowflake‚Äù

2. Lead the development of machine learning

3. Discovered an analytics solution
 Etc etc
That‚Äôs how much value the call loses per day

She's going to know its you
For all the pumping you‚Äôre doing on this, I hope you post positions tomorrow CANYONAROOOO motha fucka
ELY record earnings, anyone on the call?
Crazy thing about almost all of these earnings is that they are all pretty much decent, respectable numbers. But when you‚Äôre expected every quarter to blow out estimates by 20+% it‚Äôs kind of difficult
Almost every ipo tanks out the gate.
In the middle of ACAT transfer, locked out of trades.  I could only watch the horror.
I'm looking at 7 years of tax deductions rn. It's pretty great.
It sucked
It‚Äôs not worth it man just comment on my post instead
Bro stop looking at it at all. Move on mang. Get than shit out of your life.
No tax on losses.
I have shares so I'm cheerin from the sidelines but i fear earnings
I can‚Äôt really recommend any one in particular but watch a bunch of different ones.
Got some around close
Welcome to 2021. 

Enjoy your stay.
Hey man, atleast you made it do day two! Go enjoy some drinks and strippers
Please sir, can I have some more loss porn

Who the hell buys weekly leading up to earnings for a ticker that's gone up 70% in a month leading up to earnings.

have tsla too but just writing those off as a loss
Now imagine if you sold some puts. Ded.
Theta gang alert, get the bats boys.
I was thinking about buying DASH calls and shares cause it seemed so dumb
Lol doesn't matter, it will always inverse you no matter what. I would know, I've tried.
&gt; Dash has been trading in a range for the last couple of days. It hasn't broken out from that range yet, but it will when it does I'm sure.
You should go out to nature and get back in touch with yourself. Love is real but it can be a drug. It‚Äôs not everything. It‚Äôs about self perspective &amp; realizing that love is also a choice. Humans can be assholes. And we can ‚Äúfall‚Äù out of love easy if we get hung up on dumb stuff. Love is work.
My PLTR and FUBO shares getting destroyed while RBLX moons has to be the most demeaning shit ever *oof*
Why though, they fucking beat the earnings.
Glad I can help fam. It's put credit spread. Long as my Tesla break above $1100 by end of November, my loss gonna flip to realized gain!
[deleted]
Ok but it moved 3 cents all day long
Not ideal but with AFRM, they randomly announce new deals/partnerships or some analyst randomly announces higher PT with upgrade every few days or so
It's a perfectly middle of the road Marvel movie (though I really, really enjoyed it). 


I have no idea how it was rated lower than fucking Thor 2 or any of the Iron Mens.
By all accounts it's very generic MCU. Not worth it on its own but worth it for what it sets up at least.
Just got knocked out of the WSOP Main Event. Made it to Day 2. Short stacked and card dead for a total of 12 hours of playing in this damn tournament. $10k lit on fire.

At least my bad luck hasn‚Äôt followed me on day trading. The accounts are as green as they can be. 

Probably gonna go lose another $1k tonight. If you‚Äôre in Vegas. Come on. Take the rest of my money. My soul is already shattered.
Bold
Everybody thinks they can play both sides, but rarely does anyone can.
What‚Äôs the status on earnings for dash they miss???
stonk ded? ü•∫ in stonk heaven? ü•∫
My crappy prediction: barring some market wide event... it bleeds to 150ish until a month before next earnings.
I dip on AMD first thing in the morning. Couldn't sell it fast enough. The ship drop so fast I went from $340 profit to -$100 by the time I got out.
Not gonna Yolo but I will take a bite

I'm not sure if it is but they have a good business model because expansion is cheap and they don't have to move any inventory etc. Plenty of market share left to take. It's a classic tech company.
Anyone seen eternals? Shits getting pulled from theaters around the globe.

Seeing it tonight.
Well that wouldn‚Äôt be the same bet then would it
And today I became PLTR bagholder.

You sold to open so you must buy to close
Always wait for a bounce
Stock market today = chiraq
Derp.
I don‚Äôt think that earnings graveyard is nearly big enough for all of the UPST casualties. Nuclear blast level decimation.
There‚Äôs a third breed, neither bull nor bear, but something different‚Ä¶ something able to perceive that not only do stonks go up‚Ä¶ but they sometimes go down.
I am sorry papa Elon touched you in all the right places
down
How‚Äôs FUBO earnings looking
Fucking DASH....AGAIN!?
That's enough to start a YouuTube channel.
Upstart calls were NOT the move
Buy calls stock goes down. Buy puts stock goes up gonna start doing the ole inverse trick
That's not even 3%.

ban
Keep posting that loss porn boys, your making me feel good about myself
Selling premium is ELITE
high inflation = high prices = high profit for companies = 100 year bull run

low inflation = low costs = high profit for companies = 100 year bull run
by playing do you mean lighting my money on fire, if so, yes, 100% i'll be doing that
Spy‚Äôs toes are curling with pleasure
Yep, can‚Äôt wait for it to decline more tomorrow and my only choice is to hold my lottery ticket through earnings lmao
Depends how bad, usually just sell at a loss at open.
So tired of FB.

Once my calls go green, I'll cut the fucker. Screw this sideways trading while theta fucks me.
Won‚Äôt save it

I‚Äôd sell some puts there
I can smell a boomer from a mile away
save bets, seriously
Same with RDFN and CLOV, the CLOV selloff was weak ass sauce, couldnt even get some IV bucks. Made a couple bucks off my ITM calls and last a little on some OTM. As for RDFN, just kept going up. selloff was so small I was confused.
Didn't u/MLGCharles buy a weekly call on COIN?
Bought some calls on PayPal after its big selloff today.
I'm shorting it, join me. It popped way too much even with good earnings.

Dang it. I need to open a SOFI account.

So funny, every TSLA bear here is really a bull in disguise and wants the stock to go down to buy at a discount.
TLDR: Fuk üêªs
I would buy a whole album of those AI Spongebob characters rapping
AMD $180c 9/16/22exp.

PYPL $230c 6/17/22exp.
So uh for no reason do you unsuccessful calls do you sel at open or wait a day or two for a bounce? Askin for a friend
Thats why you use coinbase pro, low fees. Plus They have good security. You idiot
Nothing but good news from BB (granted patent for "mobile communications device providing heuristic security authentication features and related methods").

TLRY looking like it's holding up nicely. MVIS still looking juicy.

It might need to lick its wounds for a spell but long term ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)
I believe SOFI was the only way for retail to get access to the IPO. I put in for some shares but I'm not getting my hopes up as I think it will be similar to previous popular IPOs where I'm not allocated anything.

Bears will celebrate today and think they‚Äôve won the battle. However this is a test dump to trap bears for the mother of all pumps. You‚Äôve been warned.
At open I was up to 31k, was waiting for NVDA to get back up to its high from PM to bank about 7k profit and then the market went poof, closed $100 over 25k almost didn‚Äôt make the cut , Friday I didn‚Äôt and was restricted all day Monday.  The day trading 25k min is really a pain

Infrastructure hype bro it'll head back to the 20s over the next month
Blame PYPL for decline during the day. 

Blame UPST for the decline AH
With all these emojis i can assume you‚Äôre a 5year old retard

I would say tread lightly. Might wanna roll those out.
In the last two days I went from being up 18k on Meta to down 5k. ü§∑ It's a good thing red is my favorite color.
Man PLUG is 20 years old and they can't turn a profit. Maybe next decade.
Why is $ARKW drilling after hours?
COIN, PYPL, UPST all drilling after earnings‚Ä¶.. doesn‚Äôt bode well for SOFI but none of them have a bank charter catalyst or student loan moratorium ending to look forward to
I hope you get smoked
I think SPY took too many boner pills and exceeded the 4 hour period.
When that shit falls
Will start trading tomorrow, you pay market px you don‚Äôt get it at the IPO
What is out look for next quarter?
I have been trading options for over a year. I just have never sold options. I bought 100 very cheap shares and sold a call just to learn. Shares cost me $400 so I‚Äôm okay with losing that? But I don‚Äôt think I could even lose that much idfk I‚Äôm just trying to learn by doing

U is making a tiny comeback. if it's like last earnings. calls at open.

will see what happens with CPI first though.
Spy dips to 464 and stays at 466 for the rest of the week. Next week it‚Äôs hitting $470+
it peaked at $105 when it ipoed

Ford is literally my last hope. If it doesn't explode tomorrow, I'm going to walk out in front of a cement truck
How long is it gonna bleed folks?
Spy opening at 469 tomorrow
They should be fine, even with IV Crush lol... UPST is down 21%. Thats more than enough of a movement to counter IV Crush and make huge gains.
Bless ur heart
Lol imagine thinking a stock that ran 1800% is undervalued
Numbers look fine .. we'll see during the call. Users are way up, acquisition costs and lower corn pricing hurt actual trading - lots of people DCAing.

If it stays down I'll probably buy some far out calls or debit spreads
Someone bought a 10 430c 11/19s from me for more than 1k each, lol.
Ya everyone said that on my PYPL and PTON puts and they ripped. So who knows anymore. I‚Äôll set my expectations low at open lol.
Maybe after earnings? 11/18 I think? But it‚Äôs been going up pretty consistently, institutions loading up weekly. So it hasn‚Äôt really tested any lows since it was $7. 

Personally I would buy in now. Stock is gonna be 300-400 in a couple of years.
Yeah I‚Äôll just let it expire worthless and keep the premium . It‚Äôs Not much compared to how muchy shares are down

Where's the dipshit that told me COIN was going to crush earnings and YOLOing into COIN by selling my TSLA today was the play?

Dash is the reason why I will never play earnings again. Ever. Fuk
Gonna use DASH tonight and say I never received my food
Agree, earnings were good if not great. Wsb bought calls at top when it was $230 a few weeks ago. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Last time spy went up on higher than expected CPI so who knows
Company, $Dildo selling Rockets to the moon for $100. You want to buy 100 of them, but not now because you busy, but you want to have a guarantee on the price of the rocket ships. $Dildo is fine with that, but will charge you a premium to hold that price for you. If price goes up to $120, you can till pay $100 for it. This is a call option.
Dudes in the office must be busting his balls so bad. He killed UPST lmfao.

how did SHOP miss by -80% and still hasn't gone down?  this little piggie is ripe for a few put spreads
Don't forget Palantears
Look at the chart, without news it‚Äôs gonna take time to consolidate. What is the strike of your calls?
Why then? Lol
Yea I‚Äôve seen good DD on that and then a week later it shot to the moon.  What do you think is a good entry price ?
Ofc it can go back up , Also could go down or even be flat .. Not financial advice .
The wrong one, bruv. .... ooof on me.
Ahh the good ole poverty choice.
11/26 COIN puts in the morning. Shit will bleed for a couple weeks.
Said no one
My UPST puts tomorrow are gonna make me üòÄ tho. My COIN calls are gonna make me üòî. Tomorrow I should be üòë
Lmao giving some mumbo jumbo explanation when nothing goes by fundamentals these days.   


I've made profit by flipping a coin on BAC calls every month or so. Somehow it always tanks 3 days in a row and I never have the explanation for it.
Downstart had me rolling
Everything that misses earnings is sent straight to hell.... Everything that beats earnings.... also sent straight to hell. The lesson is simple. Don't play earnings. Ever. For any reason. On any side. There is no logic. Only games.
COIN creeping back up is gayer than aids
I know a way out of this‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll just buy puts on my puts.
All of my friends who trade coins use it. It‚Äôs kinda like RH, retarded and borderline bad product but easy to use
Went to target this weekend, only one small rack of button up shirts in the men‚Äôs section. Normally have a pretty wide selection..
go back to any daily thread from the summer and see how many mentions of COIN you can find compared to these past few weeks
Tesla green ah

Another good day for me. Gonna head down to the PUBM and have a cold one.
Bought some 11/12 225c on Paypal today. While all the analysts downgraded their price targets, none of them are below $250, so why would people tank it to $200? Paper hands this should bounce back
We‚Äôve all Dutch ovened before am I right?
How will CPI news affect the market tomorrow?
Should be tomorrow AH?
Repeat after me: it‚Äôs a long-term hold‚Ä¶ Check back in 5 years and see if Guh-thie was right.

And by closing it you mean? Buying a call?
Blamed Elon and Kimball cuck, wanna be cowboy motha fucka

Fucking hate earnings season.

They better buy lube and a bottle of Grey Goose.

Gonna be a rough month ahead
Loaded up on some upstart at 237. I‚Äôll figure out if it was a tard move or brilliant
Triggered my trailing stops, wouldn't mind another 0.5 drop before getting back on its ATH March.
&gt; No, you are not. You will learn your lesson eventually and buy SPY 500 EOW
You should be OK, but those with naked calls and sold puts are not having a good time right now.

That sounds like a scam.
Plus those calls where expensive as fuck. They'd have to gap up 10% just to break even lol
I‚Äôm fully aware, they didn‚Äôt beat earnings estimates they met them. Expectation was .04 and they had .04

Eh. Their premium is absurdly high. Been selling $8 CC's for the past few weeks. I'm down ~$0.70 off my average, but I'm up nearly 30% on the stock. Clov is a glorious theta play.

"It uhh... goes down :("
Watch YouTube videos as well
If the call loses half its value, the theta guys usually recommend closing it. If it goes up, let it go.
Is that because no one is going to buy it and you keep the premie
with that supposed bill coming for federal marijuana. I am focusing on sundial growers. First days of green for SNDL in a while and the short interest is pretty large but who knows. aiming on 1 dollar calls to hit by the end of november
I didn‚Äôt see it on the report. They just said October was better than Q3 so it‚Äôll be higher if that continues through year end.
Maybe there is a chance, price is recovering after hours after initial reaction.

Information is openly available. Check it out. They beat earning expectations and also they increased guidance
POSH getting wrecked
Some good news out of cloud co's at least with RNG beating earnings after FIVN did yesterday.
Is that a hint to buy calls on PSFE ?
RIP to whoever held $COIN long....WTF AH!
None of this shit matters because BF2042 is coming out Friday and I already paid for it, so I can drown my sorrows by murdering people in-game

it's a payday lender who got an absurd valuation because they call the same automated underwriting banks have had for 20 years "AI"
At my office I have access to large format printer, it has to be used every once in a while to keep the ink from going bad, so I got to take home free posters.  


I'm also in charge of ordering the catering for the classrooms, so I always buy a bit extra food just in case more people than expected show up. If they don't, I get free lunch that day.

Various take-home items such as jackets, pens, polo shirts, and laptop bags are free to me whenever I need them and considered a marketing expense because they have the company logo displayed on them.

I also track all the finances, which means I always know exactly how much everyone is making and can use that info to negotiate raises for myself.

On my work from home days, I can take a break to have sex on company time.
!banbet coin 300 3d
DASH puts were truly a terrible idea. Why do I listen to you retards?
So what are your plays.  I know shit about making good plays I just try to find knowledge people‚Ä¶..
Selling SNDL calls before they assfuck me and buying Dec AMRS calls so they can rawdog me instead
It‚Äôs funny my personal experience with products is usually how they perform on earnings, but honestly earnings is almost always a gamble so play safe
so you can get IV crushed?
#POSHMARK GUHHHHHH

That feeling when you finally pop the pimple and it bursts forth unto your mirror.
Don‚Äôt feel like being a courier anymore?
I bought in at 148.50 today
Not likely, RIOT and MARA track with corn üåΩ prices.   COIN is an exchange, different business model
TTCF weeklies
Still holding spy and amd calls. My losses aren't done.
Thanks for your kind words, can I call you Johnny Five?
Fingers crossed, just bought a bunch of calls‚Ä¶.
Anyone think nvda can go back up before Friday?
Well I was willing to lose 100% so I'm fine with anything lol
No one was quiet you just choose to remember what you want.
I was thinking of doordash puts but then I saw you tards playing the same options and I noped the fuck out.
Puts on coin in the morning?
Sounds scummy as fuck
We crossed 11mil degens and root can stay above $5
Shoulda just sold when I was up today fuck this stupid stock
[deleted]
Good thing I blew up my portfolio a few months so I had nothing to lose today. Boomer IRA I set up is calling my name to throw 6k at value stocks and leaps.
uh... that was half the news.  Nice Try Shitadel.
Arkk is definitely going down. Like x2 down.
Should have took my own advice and bought puts on FUBO.
It‚Äôs up a 1,000% in only a year. Had a huge run up past couple months on no news. Shit is in a bubble.
Hurricanes aren‚Äôt the same this year
Lol ima be so sour I'll quit this game if I sell my sofi call before ER and it moons
Me thinks my TSLA call swing eod was a tad too retarded even for myself ü§î
So I sold my first call today. Am I supposed to let it expire?? I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing just trying to learn by just doing it.

Eat more pussay
Break up with them. Duh.
So you can steal my hamburger?
Yeah I‚Äôm exhausted from winning last 3 weeks. Your turn.
UPST 400 by end of month
LITERALLY ONLY earning that didn‚Äôt crash was the one where every comment was spamming puts for: dash

Can‚Äôt make this up WOW
Those are where will hear a shit ton about inflation and supply chain issues. Could be a bumpy ride.
Yeah, its got moron energy because "my nephew and his friends play it" 

The kid who beats up your nephew and his friend are playing GTA, CoD, and Fifa
8 billion dollar deal to buy another company.... fuckers
Sometimes being cheap is good. I bought bitfarm 10c calls cause it was cheaper than riot , mara, and even hut. So far it‚Äôs the only bigly green miner on this red day. Hoping that momentum carries into the rest of the week ü§û.
Calls on $GREED
What‚Äôs the buy for tomorrow

I blame UPST shitting the bed for me shitting the bed IRL

Don't trust a fart after curry folks

Lmao but if you bought COIN calls after seeing the history of it sky diving then you love ANAL.

&amp;#x200B;

No remorse but holy shit it fucking swan dived
Learn spreads. Forces you out
So you think we should buy puts on tomorrows Earnings reports or will the trend reverse?
What earnings call were you on? They met expectations?
Thats correct. Does it matter in this market? No.
What did you all do to the market?
You ever buy a tree. Expensive af for something that grows out of the ground
Youd need to plant like trillions of trees. I dont think there is enough land on earth.

Riot and Mara going to follow coinbase tomorrow?
Tried shorting Dash many times before as I know they will never be profitable and are overvalued asf but it has a retard strength on the stock price and got burnt too many times
Shit will move 5 cents and some moron on here will be talking about how it's ripping or drilling
Lmao every time. I just got rekt by PRPL.

Bought mine at 2.2 on friday 185Ps, sold at close for around $8. Absolutely no reason to have held into the call. One day we will actually short DASH lads. One day....
Okay I‚Äôm going cash gang for the holidays while I‚Äôm still up 300% you guys have fun with this dumpster fire.

PYPL announces Walmart and Amazon = tanks.

DASH charges $58 for a hamburger = moon
I need some help here. My dad is a retired pilot. He called me asking if I knew anything about a company called Aquiline. It‚Äôs a drone delivery service established in 2019. He said they are doing a Pre-IPO to pilots ONLY. I‚Äôve tried finding their earning reports but I can‚Äôt find any. I just don‚Äôt want to see him lose money. Advice?
‚ÄúWe are projecting infinity growth indefinitely‚Äù

Based on the price action, I think TSLA bounces tomorrow morning. I have no idea what happens after that
But upstart beat expected earnings and good projected forecast, no ?
As a security guard it would be too tempting to jerk off at work for you, I don‚Äôt blame you.

Dash was down 17 bucks and I started to smile now I will frown for a while

I had a 290 P but sold cause it was up 60% during the day already. Damn.

There has to be a public disclosure period of some sort with a direct listing right? I'm going to start setting alarms for 4:05AM on every April 20th and June 9th in case he somehow stealth lists spacex and it blows up the market
$pltr lost &gt;10% this day after beating the EARNINGS ESTIMATES Back to back 2 quarters...  let the market makers decide the game Or will Retail Investors take control?
I guess wsb won't care... let's see whether wsb rallies begins pltr or keeps quite

Palantir Technologies Q3 EPS $0.04, Inline, Sales $392.00M Beat $385.02M Estimate
Mentioned:	PLTR
Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) reported quarterly earnings of $0.04 per share which met the analyst consensus estimate. This is a 104.26 percent increase over losses of $(0.94) per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $392.00 million which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $385.02 million by 1.81 percent. This is a 35.47 percent increase over sales of $289.37 million the same period last year.
TSM up .72% today. I‚Äôll take that as a win.
and still tanked lmao. some things never change
Next week is earnings for lowes .home depot. Target. Walmart .mvst. best to buy early knowing what's to come
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Looking forward to SOFI officially blowing up my account tomorrow
Guess that one DASH put I bought is fucked. Oh well.
DASH says you ain‚Äôt eating
WTF happened to dash? Algos short circuit at first?
m o o d
Double up on it!
I was about to busy UPST calls! Thanks god I didn‚Äôt but I am still losing somewhere else.. fuck the earnings shit show
&gt; It‚Äôs a good idea if you want to lose your shirt.
Yo
I work from home so I have sex on the clock, shower on the clock, trade on the clock. 

Basically do the least amount possible for my job and get paid.

[deleted]
The earnings aren't out yet are they? Where are you seeing this?
Dang. Congrats to anyone who had UPST puts.
Look at how it‚Äôs consolidating on its 1 year. This is a dead cat bounce.
You ever think about how many people are going to start jacking off in cars once self driving is really a thing. Rush hour is going to be a veritable bukkake
I‚Äôm buying the juicy dip on UPST. But is it a good idea?
Yep.  MU jumped to $90 around 2.5 years after all the MU 90 memes around here.

Same thing will happen to PLTR.

Mid-2024, PLTR will be at $50 but everyone here gambling on it will have lost all their money on those calls.
Imagine thinking UPST had more upside
my nov 26th coin calls are fucked.
Oh come
On now ROKU are you just pumping because I wrote 287.5c covered calls expiring this Friday üòíüòíüòí
Probably because of upstart lolll
Half the videos coming out of it could literally be turned into memes.
I trimmed my dash puts today at a nice profit. The rest will take it away. Oh well. Onwards
Stashing free snacks only gonna make you fat and miserable  in the long run
Every time i go to a person‚Äôs house who has a bidet theres a bunch of water splash on the top back part of the seat. Poopy backwash water all on their toilet seat. I like it in concept but idk. Either ppl cant aim or its a feature and in either case im not down
I placed puts $21.5 for 11/12
An acquisition. Conveniently revealed after close.
We hold strong brother
Yes
100 calls in PTON,  1000 shares in HTZ, 20 calls that expire tomorrow for spy...let's see what happens
PTON was the only earning play that I got right. No more ER play.
Same once it settles. Report wasn‚Äôt bad and I need more funny money exposure.
loss porn on DASH is gonna be so so beautiful

I agree, the company is rock solid; might be time to look for an entry soon
And they are diluting share holders lmao
COIN you gonna come back a bit?  POS.  January calls are crippled
spy 470 eow ez money
I have no idea who the guy is but the videos of people being carried away while the camera pans to him on stage slowly mumbling the word ‚Äúyeah‚Äù 400 times are hilarious.
Honestly that‚Äôs what I stayed away from puts. Happy I noticed that.
Roblox is overvalued as fuck it's literally a 20 year old game that is shitty as fuck and taxes u constantly
SOFI also randomly drilling AH? Just kinda following the crowd eh
Hoping for a run like TTD, but we'll see
It took one day, ONE DAY to become a bag holder
Haha same
What are chances $DASH stock turns around? They are hemorrhaging cash and spending $8.1b of stock for another company they can use to hemorrhage even more cash
Multiple high AF. Better options in SOFI or LC
What is guidance for next quarter? Has Coinbase announced that yet?
cmon plug
My Tesla puts expired but I won my ban bet... I won (fuck you TSLA bulls) but at what cost.
how the fuck is dash up
Both are still overvalued as shit
UPST, Cramer favorite. ü§£
I would suggest you to play it medium (few weeks) to long (few months) term. Daily trading as in your example is not very optimal.

Silver lining..
Lol all you TSLA nerds

Damn glad i sold my COIN calls. Whew
Everyone be like "only if there was a cheap way to capture carbon"

Are COIN and UPST obvious long term buys on this overreaction
My secret was to look at the earnings post and then go for a stock I didn‚Äôt see mentioned at all on WSB!
I plan to lose more money, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre all her right?
WSB logic: looks a 1M chart, buys puts on a red day
fucking hell I knew I should have bought some doordash calls after those uber eats numbers got released last week.
Sofi goin up or down tomorrow before earnings?
Which retards bought dash calls?
Don't remind me

Yeah and the fact that states are squeezing sports betting companies for whatever cash they can get for licenses. I still think they could do well though. I've never experience an app that actually has all the sports content I want and works well. I cycle through a lot of streaming services and usually end up cancelling them. I feel like I might hang on to fubo because of how easy it is
Damn all of a sudden don‚Äôt feel so bad about losing 15% in my $me warrants
oh shit this is huge
Oh no! Are you telling me it‚Äôs back to where it was‚Ä¶.. yesterday? ITS TANKING
&gt; I'll get it
Hey, you and L-Fitz!
wut? im on the east coast and its light.
I prevented a $200k+ loss today by selling my 2,250 Tesla shares in march 2020. Also prevented $2m in overall gains
For the next 5 months? Yeah. It's gonna drop into the 800s and then run sideways for a few more months, 0robably till the next major product launch
Got to work late because I was jacking off. Didn‚Äôt wanna be horny at work. Now I‚Äôm cool and calm
Everyone here is either in Lambos or in shambos tonight and I‚Äôm literally at net 0 between DASH and PRPL puts

beats arent shit. BNTX reported best quarter whilst being down 50% from last ER -5% 
UPST? -20%
That helps!  Sadly too late for this round.
What did Coinbase guide for next quarter?
Might just dump AMD at open, not looking good rn
Can we start today over and I don‚Äôt buy those calls. Cool thanks
Buying more at open
-25% to -11%, call that a moral victory, live to guh another day
Yep

Yeah overreaction but stock had a good run. The numbers look good since volatility was down last quarter.
Yah, I'll probably need about 180 to go green. Still, if I'm at -90%, why not hold for two weeks.
This is fine, everyone forgot that Q3 was a dip in price and volume of all the corn.

today my snow calls returned about 1.4k, i had about 1.4k free and split it between Coin calls and Dash Puts. literally will be like it never happened lul
I know the feeling. Enjoy it!
What do you do at work that maximizes taking the benefits they give you? 

For example tech job: free snacks, take a fuck ton, stash in lunch bag.
Any profit-making companies amongst this rash of bombast shit to justify the bearish quaking about tomo? Crap day today, but commods, oil, mega-tech all safe as houses...
PLTR is seriously WSB's new MU

Shit is just constantly on the edge of maybe maybe.

One day it'll blast off but all of WSB's calls would have expired worthless already.
DASH flying
IMO earnings weren‚Äôt that bad. Obviously trading activity is down but is now picking back up. The non-trading fees are increasing each quarter and will become more relevant over time.
Fuck what is the mouse going to do to us
If you work for any of those companies you're probably making over 6 figures, why would you risk that job to make like 50 bucks a day mining buttcoin
And raised estimates! Doesn‚Äôt ever move much after hours but I expect a jump tomorrow.
Can't believe I got another cc approved with my low credit.

Do I max out cash advance on this one too and YOLO SPY puts?

&gt; It's not a crisis. It's just the start of your second life.
You‚Äôve to admit it was pretty clever of dash to wrap that bitter earnings pill in a piece of cheese
Not sure about that. TSLA - 12%. COIN - 34%
What a stupid overreaction to COINS earnings. They literally killed it this quarter and the shares got fucked because they didn't kill it enough
Todays biggest winners:
Basically give out loans to people who otherwise wouldnt be able to by ‚Äútraditional methods‚Äù with their algos
So I knew Tesla was going to go down once it hit above 1100$ so as a retard I bought 3x leverage short with $15k at 1140$. Proceed to today Tesla opens green at 1165$ and like a retard I sell to get in to some shitty deSPAC that tanked 15% today. If only I kept my Tsla 3x short I could be able to afford so much pussy right now
The video was my main point, I knew I shouldn‚Äôt have mentioned the mic. What does UPST do again? üòÇ
Im here it was only 3% of my account cuz im a pussy

NIO puts gonna make me rich tomorrow ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
She sold a lot of tesla and coin (yesterday), so in fact she's a genius (for now).
What happened to U???
Please tell me most of you tsla call people actually sold out for profit after 3,000% gains and didn't diamond hold.
-7% after being 12% up at open. Had to scratch that itch. I'd probably be safer on meth
JEFFERY üòà $AMZN to 3650 tomorrow for the BOIS ü•É *fuck your fucking puts pussieh* ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) We drinking proper whiskey tonight

Right? Actually kind of hope the AH action holds because what a great buying opportunity
I wish I sold at open today.... was not expecting that üòî
Buy the dip Phoenix üòõ
Lol.  I‚Äôm a bull but also a realist.  I think the market is going higher if you stick to Industrials and certain commodities like copper.  I‚Äôm just not a TSLA bull lol, as I knew I‚Äôd be heading to the slaughter house.
Binoculars ready for tlry liftoff üöÄ
lol yeah , my post is a joke . I did buy at 148 at least . They still beat expectations so hope it stays 250 or so for a while .
COIN stay down pls

"If you had earnings today, fuck you" - stock market
Picked em up after market open today..  Seems to be bouncing now though so who knows.  Could still be worthless tomorrow
What DID he have on the Clintons?
Were earnings released already?
Strange days ü§° markets
hopefully. lets see how many bagholders exist after that earnings call
Hello again longer holder. My 1 call looks okay right now, fingers crossed
Strange how we go from easy mode to hard mode in seconds, huh?
Nah. NIO puts go brrrr
I'm going to go cash in my COIN Puts and buy more shares if this thing stays below 310
Still not as far down as TSLA
Need TSLA to go down another $50 tomorrow so I win my banbet
Yea I keep adding and getting kind of anxious to move on from the play. Id like it now to deploy the capital again.
I'm down $200 on a 180p. Thankfully I sold my 170p for a $200 gain intraday otherwise I'd be down $400. Glad I didn't go in with more capital though.
No I have a bunch of shares, gonna add some more with this huge dip
I still don't even know what does UPST do?
I think you know how this ends
if you dont have a bidet you are poopy butt gang.

walkin around stinking up the place with poo all up in your pants. disgusting.
Upstart? More like Upchuck
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 231.83 points, or 1%, to 25,520.24, the S&amp;P 500 lost 21.22 points ,or 0.81 percent at 2 769 .07 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 70 .52points ,or 0% t o 7 542 .85
Averaged fown on my Tesla calls and sold on the bounce, luckily flat! Will count as a day trade, but don't care.
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/MalwareInjection** bet **TSLA** goes from **1018.55** to **990.0** before **2021-11-14 16:42:11.492737-05:00**
Fuck are you talking about? it's down 1.85% AH ,your puts are fine
this is what expert Wall Street analysts refer to as an after hours earnings shitshow
[deleted]
Sold off my call today, just rather take a smaller profit then risk getting paypalled
So are all stocks gonna plummet after ER if they don‚Äôt double beat, post huge guidance, and cure cancer? Guess so
Alright I'm here to collect my COIN ten.. GUUUUUUH  
LMFAO ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271), at least I'm holding shares I guess
Sold a put?
Felt like a pro saying that and you ruined it ‚òπÔ∏è

Goddamn. Can't believe I've missed it. What is it?
No more playing earnings for me
AFRM &amp; SOFI üëÄ at UPST like wtf
Problem with FUBO is they are at mercy of companies like Espn which can jack up the price . So profitability will be hard
You're right. I thought EPS consensus was 1.68, but it was 1.56, so they beat.
Me last week: I am a genius üòé 

#Me this week: OH NO ü§°üï∂üëå

I don‚Äôt often buy puts but when I do I lose

Gonna need AUPH to announce buyout before these calls expire.
that means doordash stock price is worth 1/8 of their current price easy lol
So go down 10%.  Wtf

true. I assumed he was talking about ER stuff
Earnings is where it‚Äôs at isn‚Äôt it? The fuck

Welp I put everything in PLTR calls, I guess we will find out if fortune favors the bold -- or if I'm just a retard destined to be poor
Same ‚Ä¶ain‚Äôt scared
Coin flipped between POSH calls and COIN puts and lost the flip :)
Call started late lol
Lmao
You're up $900 and losing money every day?
I thought you were supposed to shit *in* hot tubs‚Ä¶
You‚Äôre missing the nuance in my comment. I called the run to $1200 and the dip after. Tesla always does this. Been calling their moves for months.
that's the conference call. the report will be released some time before that.
It is team red. And I'm a call holder
Sell and roll that money into puts on something reporting tomorrow
Just need PRPL to drill more to cover the DASH losses
WYNN with the inversing inverse inversed-inverse reversal earnings action
If you're selling then always be willing to take on assignment unless something fundamentally wrong with company is revealed imo
Haha icl that was a good line. But fuck you nonetheless üòÇ
Are the shoe shine idiots gone yet or is it gunna be a few weeks before they are bankrupt? I can keep the show going as long as I need to in order to make some of you grow up. God it smells like fucking cope in here
I know we rallied super hard as far as indexes but if you‚Äôre a bear and didn‚Äôt make *tons* of money this earnings season you are just bad at picking plays straight up, no debate.

Literally like 7-8 companies tanking &gt;20%
Wait they beat earnings and missed revenue
Fuck me. Dash is mooning. Good thing I sold off 3 of my 5 puts before close.
Well when even Musk is saying it‚Äôs overpriced it shouldn‚Äôt take a genius to predict what‚Äôs coming.  Of course he‚Äôs going to sell his shares.  He has a huge tax bill to pay, loans against his stock to pay, and doesn‚Äôt draw a salary.  He‚Äôs just smart enough to sell at the top.
It is a shark navigator‚Ä¶ $40 off on the costco website‚Ä¶ not quite at the Dyson yet
On shark tank and in general people only pay 5x for one years profit. So what would dash be worth based on that metric?
To that one guy that was telling me why FUBO would go down: you were dead right. Looks like operational costs involving their new sports betting app and streaming licenses.  


Still dumb though, because they increased their subscribers a shit ton. I only have a small call but I honestly might lookin into investing for the long term.
COIN takes the "Ooof of the day award".
Market makers have to eat too, they like steaks
PUBM finally making me money lets fucking go
Can you start an online course so I can learn?
So who's the earnings God?
Like who gets to say drop or rise?

Because it sure as heck looks random
Upstart is now Downend
ELY with good earnings...market plz respond accordingly.
You'll know when we know...
Really great from $FUBO in regards to beating revenue, increasing projections, and also increasing membership and membership projections.

This is going way the fuck up soon, pay no mind to the AH action.
pretty zen on fubo. expect heavy price action tomorrow on these incredibly bullish earnings
gonna yolo riot
you buy 10 days before ER or sell/buy 1 day after ER
Nice to know two day drop. Don‚Äôt forget it was after 57% return in 3 months. GTFO
Damn im scared for DIS.
they were incredibly inflated, with expectations for a beat like last quarter priced in. might not be the worst stock to grab some calls on tho, lot of people with hopium for UPST
Thanks. Seems like a bit of an overreaction but I could say the same about most ER in recent quarters
i bought more shares to sell once hits $26 for the hundredth time
miss on EPS, beat revs. That's sounds about right to make Wall Street cum for growth companies. Also "adjusted ebitda" was towards the top end of the range
New stage unlocked: DENIAL
Well looks like Tesla is going to be down for a long time really was hoping it would just correct itself ah
Yes
Hey man solid housekeeping products are no joke
It‚Äôs a stupid, clunky interface designed to prevent morons from doing moronic things. Unfortunately that gets in the way of smart people trying to act fast
Too much potential for PLUG in my opinion.

It‚Äôs basically the future.
The definition of insanity, right?
Why not just buy cryp*to ?
Dyson?
Nobody really talks about it, stupid growth every quarter
Probably because of COIN
When do you usually buy the contracts? Like in the morning or a few days earlier?
No way if stays green after earings at 5
I picked up 4 at $3.10. Jealous of your position lol
AFRM too
Honestly honey if I knew coin was releasing earnings after hours I never would have bought those calls
Ouch! Better check if it's prolapsed after this drop!!
[deleted]
DoorDash was easy look at Lyft and Ubers earnings call , upstart was easy . Bitch was a 100 dollar stock selling for 400
Shoulda bought dash calls tbh I ordered Taco Bell 3x this week.
Too soon junior
$200 now.
Fukin dash. I fukin quit this stupid market
Copping Rivian and TSLA tomorrow
Welcome to you late 20s. It goes from
This club is playing my jam to the grocery store is playing my jam.
If you were in here Feb , I told everyone multiple times (probably like 20 times) when it was trading at $23-$25  that this stock will be flat and will barely beat or lose to SPY for the next few years and they ask why would they invest in PLTR if it won't beat SPY. I even told them buying leaps is retarded if they are going to hold until expiration , some made money on the leaps but they are definitely down 50% if they didn't sell at the peaks in June and Sept.
Always inverse WSB. Retards thought DOORDASH was free money.
Nice! I got 1 $45c for 0.17 earlier so hoping I can make a little bit, fingers crossed
WTF is it with so many of these executives having shitty webcams and mics? Seriously
Welcome to adulthood
That is true.

I learnt my lesson from RBLX ytd so I set a stop loss with much bigger gap. Between 190 and 195 and it hit at 193 just now.
dunno but restaurant takeout has increased like 50 fold

UPST Holy fuck lmao
Hold them or sell at open tho?‚Ä¶
Wynn doesn't know wtf to do.
That's fine if it does but the IV crush alone regardless of it going the other direction is going to eat up about 40% of that.
upst seems like overreaction. i know shits overvalued but it had double beat earnings. maybe calls at open tomorrow? ü§î
I bot
Have you considered working for doordash? I tip well
He has about 21mil to unload and volume was almost triple average daily today. I'm betting signed off on Monday for Tuesday dump.
Lmfaooooo bruh. No fukin way
Guys are my PLUG puts fucked? I feel like they missed hard but there wasn't much of a downside AH
It‚Äôd be very cash money of PENN to drop 5% tomorrow
Tomorrow? Plenty of loss porn from just today. Horrible day
Downvote all you want bag holders.  Doesn‚Äôt make it less true!

#WHAT COULD GO WRONG
[deleted]
You don't understand how a stock that ran 1500% in a year has a few point pull back after earnings??
I am 27 and the most exhilarating thing to happen to me in the past 6 months is me getting my new vacuum tomorrow
The stock was up 300% at one point in the past 2 months.

That would have required the mother of all beats to justify.

It had a solid beat + guidance raise, but not one for a company still up 200% over the past 2 months.  This is an appropriate move.
Loading up on spy calls that‚Äôs for sure
Luckily I had one put on DASH cost me $30 and I feel like shit. Can't imagine those who were crazy short. Post that loss porn so I can feel better.
Well I put 5k in dash puts and 5k in coin puts hope my coin puts off set the 5k I'm losing on dash
I got 10x of these at 2.70 each..  I wanna know too
Best day in months after this RBLX run
I'm long on LCID but i think anything over $40 is lofty valuation but we're in a weird timeline
DASH crushed revenue estimates. People thought revenue would fall due to pandemic stocks falling, but DASH is actually a lazy person stock and people didn't suddenly get less lazy. They beat last quarter's revenue by 3%. That's why it's going up.
I think that‚Äôs a solid ass play
Move money from stock market: put it all in loop ring crypto. May take time for funds to transfer though... not sure if will have access in a day
This is why valuations matter. You slap a 10000x multiple on something it‚Äôs gotta be better than good.

Your point?
Buy the GME dip of course
I bought a DASH 11/12 $240C just before close. Let's see that report, fellas.
fuck it. im buying the COIN dip tomorrow. fake money has been on fire which means the current Q numbers should be spectacular but im also retarded
Anyone else get the feeling TSLA has peaked?
But what if earnings r bad at 5 o‚Äôclock no way they stay green
I grabbed a bunch of $45 calls right before the bell for 0.50 each. Can‚Äôt wait to see where we end up at open tomorrow
I may be biased, but I see this pulling an BNTX and bleeding the fuck out on a rug pull in the AM.
This
That's literally not how valuations work.
Sell COIN 11/19 $300p at open or hold?
We need BRDS options!
Pray my positions go green

he said "PLTR TO THE MOON"

isn't that sufficient enough DD to yolo
Glad UPST got dicked. Loving this earnings-meet-reality season we're in. Might short BYND tmrw even tho they played it smart and adjusted guidance a few weeks ago.
doubled down. but with no more earnings this year. i dont know whats gonna push it up.
Same
Bruh my NIO puts r getting fucked
That softbank stock is so manipulated idk why people try
Well my DASH puts might end up as a bust but thankfully I grabbed a bunch of PRPL puts as well, Jesus fuck what did that company do kill a few employees?
I really was out here thinking it would be fine that I lost my job last week. I thought I'd be able to live off my accounts....not after today.

that lady gonna buy more today. smh
Any NIO news yet?
DASH has  me shook.  Conveniently announce a deal right before shit earnings is the play
I need a glass of vodka
After UPST, if you have a stock that's up 200-300% in the months before earnings... take a lot of that off the table.

There's no way any company can meet those expectations; UPST beat significantly and raised guidance and it's down 22%.

The only one that hasn't sold off hard is NET.  I'm expecting it to at some point.
Dang my banbet coin 400 tomorrow dont feel so good
Missed on revenue, beat earnings

Welp, not sure what IV crush is on these DASH 185 puts, but I think all $1,200 will vanish tomorrow. Guess I'll be lucky to keep a couple hundred.
impressive
One of the last comments on the Daily thread was a guy saying to buy COIN calls and DASH puts. Mad respect to that guy if he's still alive.
I thought DASH was gonna go down:( rip

Im not new and you didnt read my post. It was never at 215 market throughout the day. And that price should have never executed. The market open @ 212 should have been the trigger.

TOST is Toast

Or did you just X through all the dialog prompts like you're playing Zelda?
COIN was like $200 2 months ago. It‚Äôs still way overvalued even after this earnings drop
DASH shorts in shambles. They spend their last $200 on those puts

PUBM giving some earnings indication, I would hope anyway ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

I don't know,  it's never been my decision. Probably both.
Guidance? For where it's going? Based on current trajectory the ground.
Only thing that can save my COIN call is them announcing they have the cure for cancer
What is this bear shit. I guess a bear does shit in the woods and all over wsb
Morning coin is the play
It‚Äôs usually not too accurate around earnings time
Reminds me of a joke. A 4 yr old boy and his 6 yr old brother were getting dressed in the morning and decided before they went into the kitchen, they were tired of not being able to swear. Today was the day they were going to swear in front of their mother. When the mother asked the 6 yr old what he wanted for breakfast, he said, " I want fucking Cocoa Puffs!". Whack!, his mother slapped him right across the face. She turned to the 4 yr old, "What do you want?". He said, " I sure as shit don't want fucking Cocoa Puffs!"

does anyone else get a sick joy from watching a ticker that you've lost money on tank? i don't have puts but UPST to the center of the earth still puts a smile on my face
That guy posting 50k of UPST calls earlier ü§°
Is it me or is the winning strat just always buying puts? looks like you win 9/10 times
Was thinking same thing. This does not look very promising
imagine being a bul lmao ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Really dash, really. I am fucking done with earnings play
Coin beat. Plunges. Makes sense
Pleas
Just like we all expected, RNG was the earnings move.
 Never buy at market price. You need to place limit orders.

Market is going to get you your share at whatever price available at that moment. Hence it filled at 215 for you.
Buying COIN I guess fuck
Shitcoins are finished after this bubble. This will be the last one before it goes into a long crypto winter. Coin sold their bags at the top when they IPOd
Visualmod, do you even stonk?
She‚Äôs coming to get drunk probably not the other shit
Dash always goes up on earnings just like Palantir always drops.  These are immutable laws of physics
maybe try to post some on the internet
I think I will definitely invest in them after this cools down a bit
This may be a good idea. Any idea why this ER was so bad? Decline in users or transaction volumes?
&gt;Ouch!

Damn 
COIN call holders got wrecked
Dash cucking every one
Burry compares the current situation with the tulipmania. During the tulipmania, tulips went up 1,100% in one month following YEARS of massive, speculative growth. The following month it all came crashing down. 

Therefore, until TSLA or the fake gold goes up 1,100% in a month, we are in for some more massive gains.

Thanks for coming to my DD.
I think I have to stop using Tik-Tok. I don‚Äôt think my mind was prepared to handle a direct line of chubby cat girls straight to my eye balls at 5G speeds
PLTR lol
Unfortunately. Im in the process of trying to switch out I just closed out 30k in positions. Saw paypal seemingly oversold so I bit.
who tf told me PLTR was gunna be $60 EOY in January...

this fkn stock sucks ass
I'm convinced that PLTR is the schrodingers cat of tickers. Taking a position disrupts its superposition and results in the opposite of whatever the fuck you were hoping it would do.
[deleted]
Fuggggg. Thought the dash jump was a fakeout... its not looking that way now.
HUT 8 for earnings?
I will take some boring flat TSLA days for rest of week. We dead smack in the middle of my condors
[deleted]
You deserve a permaban for even considering HOOD should go up in price
Doesn't take much for financial math really. Draw a squiggly line up and to the right and say "my projection" done. Stamped and moving forward.

That drawing is then given to some poor sap who paid attention in school and got a degree to do complex modeling. They are left with the drawing in a darkroom and told they can't come out until they can find a stock that in 2 weeks or less matches that squiggly line.

Then the person that wrote said chart goes out and has a glass of wine that cost as much as that person's paycheck.
Earnings call hasn‚Äôt started yet.
[bitties](https://imgur.com/U9MG6mM)
Does she peg you before or after?
not a dip. a reckoning.
me me
11/12
Don‚Äôt have one coin left after COIN did it‚Äôs thing.
Cold food and over priced it‚Äôs the next peloton
Was going to get puts on coin but went with dash. Of course.
COIN about to release shamble coin
I am super glad I couldnt afford COIN call premiums lmaoo
COIN was up 40% in the last month. Felt obvious it would crash
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
So do we know if Elon sold today?
When will Coinbase release guidance? I need some hope
Dude AMD bounced back 5 times, tmrw probably huge gains again
Tsla dump another 12% tomorrow üò¨
Loaded up on SHCR calls, hope the market's in the mood for the massive beat they're about to deliver
There was a huge wash of 100k+ shares sold at 367.39 then same buy at 357.39. Maybe she locked in a quick insurance policy.
printing premarket bleeding during market hours as usual
So many people called me retarded for calling COIN puts earlier this week. Almost every big tech earnings has dumped this quarter.
COIN FUCKING LOLLLLLLL
Yes
STOP THE COUNT!
WHY IS DASH UP WHY
I know there‚Äôs at least one idiot in here that bought coin calls and dash puts
Trash, shit company DASH going up. At least I bought RBLX calls pre-earnings
reeeeeee.
5:00 EST
Thinking about FOMO into TSLA since its looking real juicy at $1k
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised she‚Äôs doing two at a time.
Are you on Robinhood? They can be a bitch when prioritizing orders.
üåàüêª strikes after 9 days ü§™
I'm thinking $AFRM is next to drop big in this clown market's earning season. It has run up like crazy and consumer spending is expected to decrease... see Visa/MC and PayPal. The plus side for them are their top retailer partnerships like Target and Amazon.

Retards aren't even paying off their monthly charges in time though. See https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/10/30/its-not-just-affirm-sezzles-bnpl-borrowers-are-fal/
Well after seeing PYPL and UPST take a massive ump I'm going in on SOFI puts.
oh shit lmao
oof (username). At least you got your internet coin
Yep same. Feel like if I would've picked coin it would have done what dash is doing now
[deleted]
Does this include the drunk woman that passed out behind the dumpster
You checked post market? Haha I'm scared to read the earnings report.. haha
Cointards would have had a large ass position. I on the other hand purely gambled on their earnings and lost. There‚Äôs a different there.
With market limits.
Well for once she made the right move, trimmed her position before ER
Do y'all make out with your girl after she eats your ass
SOFI down also
So it can be slower? What's the pointtttt
Puts on everything reporting earnings tomorrow it is
The only COIN that isnt expiring worthless is my penny üòî
At least I got shares.
I'll poke your knee caps.
RNG was the play . Random number generator would have come up with it
Well would ya look at ELY
You realize it is a Chinese company. Call is 8 pm tonight
&gt; You can't.
My call was a lotto play anyway but hope no one was dumb enough to be balls deep in coin and hold past earnings
So why did UPST die?  Someone sold off anyway?
Pour one out for COIN and UPST bulls. COIN had me interested, glad I didn't get fucked again this quarter report
I think they will. I‚Äôm too chicken shit to leave my money again over night though.
Thank you random tard for saving my ass https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qq19w5/_/hjz8ekr/?context=1

Sold for 100% gain instead of 100% loss by tomorrow

Okay let see üëÄ a show of hands üôå if you‚Äôre getting  your cheeks clapped üëè
Guhthie Woods
I predicted PayPal shitting the bed, but I thought for sure DD was going to eat it
tesla puts gonna be printing premarket
We‚Äôre goin up tomorrow
[deleted]
I have 1 45c so I would like that. Not much I know
How do you make a market order at a specific price? A market order just executes at open.
SOFI as well fml...
i fuckin hope so
Real me shows emotions
And it‚Äôs rockets
TSLA fucked tomorrow
Looking for NIO to drill hard
If internet money is following historical trends which it looks like it is that may be a bad idea tbh
*Cries in $PLTR*
Welp, looks like I am playing CPI tomorrow.
Lol still can't get over how papa john did that.

What a clown.
RBLX a shining green beacon in a sea of red
Where are you seeing earnings?
I got 12/31 500 calls, I talked to jpow and he says no problem
üíéüëãüèª
Wtf DASH, you should have died
Remember those $480cs you had for today?
[deleted]
Kill dash
If I cum, and you cum....then it cancels out and NNN stays in play
My dash puts beg to differ
Compared to calls? Not at all.  200 otm calls were more expensive than 100 otm puts, shit was stupid
I need a update on ur calls
Sooo you want to go slower?
The wife says if these SPY puts print I can Hellcat swap the Town and Country. The other soccer dads are gonna be so jealous.
If you bought COIN calls today, aren't u one? ü§°

Don't ask me Abt my PYPL calls though.
RIP cathie the wood
UPST was already pricing in the beat + raise of the century.  No way to meet that.

Even at $250 it's up 100% over 3-4 months ago.
AutoMod is actually Elon.
PLTR below the 200, we dead boys
Yes I realize this after it reversed upwards ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
DoorDash 

- Delivering soggy food using desperate people.
Cramer likes this chump Matt Maddox, but the only way I see him filling Steve's shoes is if he peed in them.  Even that, I doubt his balls store that much pee.
Seeing all these earnings come in, I'm thinking maybe I cut SoFi tomorrow before close.
OK, good point.

What if I lease a Tesla, do it, and they don't notice or something.
UPST LOSS PORN TOMORROW üìàüìàüìàüìàüìà
just the usual, you need to declare bankruptcy to moon
Who‚Äôs dying from UPST?

‚úã
U was up ~20% in the last 5 days. Before you prep for takeoff check if you‚Äôre already on the moon.
Was thinking COIN and UPST puts‚Ä¶ but ultimately decided on DASH‚Ä¶ fucking retarded
[deleted]
PLTR? Maybe coin?
How do I always miss the good DD? Guh
Burn
üòÇ
looks like TSLA puts might print again tomorrow. too bad i only got 4x 1000p today at open
It‚Äôs dead bud
fuck i was so close to going in on POSH, the only smart move ive ever made
What did she do!? She sold quite a bit of COIN recently
Except straight up
Uh huh. You sure it had nothing to do with your smoking habit?
Nah dude, it's dead
Holyshit COIN

And i thought I had a bad day. RIP all COIN peeps
Imagine thinking anyone on CNBC could pass general chemistry 101, imagine thinking they are qualified to talk about financial math. Imagine üåà ü¶Ñ
Don't forget PLTR ü•≤
I set a market order for Paypal @ 215, and the stock opened at 212. My order went through at 215, which isnt that huge of a deal but makes no sense. Shouldnt it have been picked up at 212? Anyone know how this could happen?
I‚Äôm a bag holder now and it‚Äôs alright. I don‚Äôt deserve money
The fuck is coin dragging RIOT down for?
Have some internet points, seer.
Institutions selling Upstart after earnings no matter what even after its beat. My avg cost is $60 but still painful to see such a big selloff in one day.
I should‚Äôve known to buy UPST puts when they offered my retarded overleveraged ass a loan worth half a year‚Äôs salary after asking me like 3 questions
I was up 14% today... earnings happened... I think I'm going to be down 50 to 60% at open tomorrow...

I swung my big dick right into a pair of pruning sheers called COIN. Word of advice don't do that.

I was euphoric with roblox. My swinging could not go wrong... then it did.
Hurts
COIN chart looking like erectile dysfunction  bruhhhhh wtf lol
remember coins earnings are from last quarter.. before everything started running. could be an opportunity to load up on some calls for next year
COIN puts going to print **like a mother fucker.** Too bad I didn't buy any.
Remember, 2 red days in a row is illegal.
[deleted]
Lol fuck
Door dash to buy company to lose more money this shit needs to fucken dieeeeeee
FUBO FUBO Did you do a BooBoo?
DASH gonna pull a PYPL tomorrow lol
FUBO literally reached 1M subscribers and knocked out the earnings out of the park and still tanking? Wow üòíüòíüòí
I guess we just have to wait things out until this passes. Glad I don‚Äôt buy weeklies. Expect more of the same from SPY, maybe even drop down to $463 before a push back to $466/67. Either way this week and next week we pull back.
does anyone have puts on monday.com?
I love the random ride just from the hold music on Ely earnings call.  If Ely goes to 35 a share tomorrow I am getting a set of TCB raws from the tour department.  If not I am getting a box of chrome soft xls.
Still can't believe I had a nightmare about the market crashing last night
Opening a position in PRPL at these prices. Quick 15% flip by Friday
Doordash is the worst company that won‚Äôt die. I bought puts on them before and learned my lesson. The company just never goes down.
Uber is a trash company, Dash is not. Compare earnings and sales growth

My coin call is in danger. Hehe.
no what does that mean?
Can‚Äôt drop shit. It‚Äôs got a skateboard chassis. Nowhere to put the driveshaft and other stuff.
Has not been a great earnings season

RBLX is king
Going in largely on NVST to try to to hedge my inevitable options losses
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/spreadsTrader (1/2) made a bet that HOOD would go to 40.0 when it was 36.25 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Except for the fact that I‚Äôm down 80% because I bought them yesterday
PUBM
calls on alcohol and [www.wsbsynth.com](https://www.wsbsynth.com) tonight
Whaaaaa
PUBM on track to be up 50% tomorrow
Poop. NIO earnings at 8PM EST...I guess ill twiddle my dingle
yeah..i scalped 200 shares from 29 to 34, then 30.75 to 32.20
I lost money on buying coin calls but it‚Äôs whatever I kept it small. I honestly feel very bad for the cointards.
I know TSLA is still up bigly in a month but all those meme "TSLA didn't drop much" posts on WSB yesterday was an indicator as fuck

Classic WSB

Feels good
DASH why are you flat you scam stock
*looks at 3m chart*
Wow RIP coin call holders actually feel bad don‚Äôt do anything stupid lol
Thank you for gracing us with your poetry
FUBO‚Ä¶.you let me down
Dead bidome, can you gib me some coins pls

Edit: didn't mean that, but thanks anyways
Anyone else getting long calls on PYPL tomorrow?
I get entirely too much satisfaction out of Cathie just continuing to fuck up
What time we meeting behind the dumpsters boys
Doesn't look a bad thing atm tho
Puts on anything you think will make money.
PRPL gang dead , mattress king btw
Makes you wonder what you normally watch.
I saw a report that she dumped $27M in COIN yesterday
Dash is green.
Gotta live and die by Elon when you play with tesla
Lmao she bought Zillow and off loaded the next day.
because we touch ourselves at night ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
If it makes sense to buy puts on it, buy calls. If it makes more sense to buy calls on it, buy puts. You're welcome
I now know what those poor souls that held SNAP thru earnings felt‚Ä¶ #metoo #endportfolioabuse
I think I caught PYPL at the bottom.  Made a few grand off bigc 

All my other moves this week have bee total shit.
It literally wasn‚Äôt. Puts were expensive.
You can just close your calls.right before and make.cash from the iv spike. I made 100pct from ford puts and that was prolly the worst play of the year. But at least I didnt hold them thru earnings
Uh uh you‚Äôre breaking up
It just won't, fuckin thing
How much of that revenue is from credits lol
If I were NIO I'd be scared of releasing earnings too üò≠
Probably because of COIN
SPY going down, AMD flat. You know what that means. üìà.
Has BYND reported yet? waiting for the fate of my puts
lolol they got like 1 million subscribers and revenue was 156m, they‚Äôre currently priced at 30x revenue. You‚Äôre trying to explain to the market that they should be priced at 70x?
When's NIO ER?
see you're supposed to MISS earnings to moon, hopefully these companies will get it next quarter.
Oh look WSJ just so happens to publish some DASH deal right at close. What a coincidence.
bruh if news breaks that Elon sold a bunch of stock this is not a dip you want to buy
Naw, average price of $240 so good, but should have sold at the peak
I agree but we may see 950 or so tomorrow before the uptick begins
I have nio puts so you bet it‚Äôs gonna moon to $60
Dumped even before ER over 10 percent. Just weird
Without stimmy woulda been like 180
People been saying that since their IPO and yet here we are
Vizio wighbhulk dick wtf
Can we start a Reddit poll to get Elon to buy back in? Twitter polls are trash. I'm talking to you, mods!
They probably shouldn‚Äôt  comment. That‚Äôs a insider trading move, because no rational person would of done that.
I‚Äôve found that if I would just stick to my original plan and not panic and change it by hedging or doubling down it would‚Äôve worked out for me in the end. But nooo i got a fuck it up
Idk, its kind of like opening a christmas present (with the chance you get coal)
Rh says 1.56 exp vs 1.62?
Upstart beat all expectations but stock is plunging...go figure
üëè I guess?
How much money do you have?
So glad someone saw this
DIE DOOR DASH DIEEEEE
Haha COIN. Lmfao.
DASH is playing with me too much üìâüìàüìâüìàü´Ä
DASH decided to take all the earnings losses in advance. that shit is straight as fuck
look again fool
Door dash put holders didn't see that aquisition coming. Fuck
That "hemi" is about as fancy as "fine Corinthian leather."
The one stock I thought was going to shit the bed. Sigh
Thanks. I need it
What does UPST do?
DASH Q3 EPS $(0.30), Sales $1.27B Beat $1.18B Estimate
Everything was priced in already if earnings were good. If not there will be a continuation of large dumps in this overpriced market.
DASH epileptic seizures
DASH straight teasing us at this point
bro, power hour gave a nice chance to print on calls..scalped 35% on 205c..went in heavy with 20 contract but the pump helped
Nice
UPST puts was free money
Told you guys DASH would beat.

That 1dte RUT call spread I sold @ close, though. ü§ë
Wtf is PUBM, and why the hell was I not paying attention to it???
Nice
Same group that got rowdy on the pton er
Those gains meant my entire portfolio was only marginally down today! Beautiful.
Wow bull flags all over Chegg, gonna have to move some money to that tomorrow
Lol dash is going up why did I even bother.. should have fuck with coin instead
Imagine investing in shit like coin that guhthie buys the top and sells the bottom of. Imagine not realizing everyone in Wall Street is a fucking regard unworthy of learning how to basketweave from me and the only way they make money is manipulating the market and selling you bags. Imagine üåà ü¶Ñ

The skinny or the fat one?
FUBO - Just WTF. Sold off even before earnings over +10% for no reason.  Bounces back once earnings reported. Weird asf
Everything down besides DASH .
Did UPST say the N word?
i'm just all capsing, BUT WHYYYYY
Why
WSB in shambles.
oh wow whoever had roblox weekly calls congrats and sorry whoever sold them covered

I concur. The Progressives are functionally illiterate. Know nothing about how this country runs. Hey, let‚Äôs go after stocks and everybody will be happy.
üí¥üí¥üí¥
So I guess POSH missed their earnings estimate lol
Dash is a well run company that is growing at nearly 200% per year and you retards buy puts.
Da fuq why is DASH now green
Same dude, same.
"red light green light" going on with fubo lol
DASH with that pump fake
Dash is buying out some company that's why it's up
The holdmusic for Ely earnings call very classy. About to duck my shares and calls in the assy.
i should have stayed away
Shout out to u/kg360 dropping that coin dd. Loaded it puts. Thanks bro!
whoever at TD allowed me access to options needs a promotion asap for how much money i‚Äôve given them

probably because of COIN
Look again.
Whoa COIN! Calm your tits
Getting the hell out of my DASH put
I bought 1 12/11 45c before close for 0.17. Trying to work out what its worth now lol. Probably a little gain
The real question is where wouldnt I touch you? I‚Äôd go all the way to the prison wallet
Glad I only put $1000 in PYPL at $230.  This shit just keeps tanking
lol "beat"
Unfucking real. Huge loss and it shoots up
Cathie's gonna have her hands full tomorrow buying the dip on UPST, DASH, COIN, FUBO, TSLA, PLUG, U
I wonder what will be bigger‚Ä¶

My losses on coinbase or my gains on the coinbase app ü§î
in the heart &lt;3
Holy.Fukin.shamble.lamble.ding.dong.
slice‚Äôo‚Äômatic.everywhere.
Just when I was getting excited about my DASH puts this goes and happens. Balls.
Whatever happened to NIO‚Äôs earnings call ??
What call
TSLA actually went to oversold on the 4 hour RSI. Given the volume was double the last few days, I'm willing to bet Elon sold a significant chunk of his stock. 
Looking at TSLAs history in regards to RSI, it hardly ever gets to oversold territory and the two times it has have resulted in 20% plus monthly rally upward. 
This is a buy the dip spot. Wish I had bought puts, but I'll take the call spot now.
Enjoy getting syphilis
Do I load up on COIN calls at open for Q4?
So, NIO will get crushed whether they beat or not?
Fucking bought the wrong puts fuck me
Don't leave us hanging. What were your plays?
of course DASH is pumping fuck this planet
Holy shit DD rekkin mfs
Plastic silicon beds that a large portion of people don‚Äôt find comfortable? 


What a surprise it drops!
Calls on?
Yes they should. At this point it‚Äôll just be how much profit you‚Äôll get.
HAHAHAHAHHA BYE UPSTART
I hear coinbase is bringing Ke$ha in for their annual party. "Its going down yelling timber."
Pp
I like how Gitlab only dropped 0.05% today. Given the rest of the market I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a win and a half
Good wisdom and discipline. Many Pros feel the same way
CoinBase more like DeadBase amirite
Where do you see they beat LOL
Nice
UPST and COIN, guh!
I‚Äôm holding 200 shares @ $46.08 avg. I was going to sell $30 calls but I thought it‚Äôd be better to wait until earnings In case it ripped. At this rate I‚Äôm going to be passing down these bags to my grandchildren

Upstart crushed earnings . This is going back up
Welp 0 for 2 on coin calls and dash puts. FML. Oh well. Glad I kept it small

I FUCKING TOLD YOU UPST PUTS.

I had all my money in TSLA puts til close damn. Shoulda quickly moved to short UPST.
DASH rebounding lmaoo
I like how we all knew, deep down, that FUBO and COIN were going to crash and DASH would go up. It didn't make any sense so we went with what was most logical even though we knew that the market is illogical right now.
üåàüêªüí¶üí¶
Coin died and Pubm flew..
Once the dust settles in TSLA, the sub is about to get reaaaal quiet from all the bulls that got BTFO'd (and maybe some bears too if it stabilizes higher)

When did you buy Coin, yesterday?
472c looks easy meat
Unity announced earnings but they are supposed to have a webcast starting at 2 pt.  
https://investors.unity.com/overview/default.aspx
300% would suffice
I'm down. But I'm up for anything
Pants getting so tight watching those options go to 0!!! The loss porn will be straight bukkake. Pussies better post that shit
it was $10 but you know, inflation
Pulling a FB/AMD lol
Dash‚Ä¶first you fuck up my order today and now this? Why‚Ä¶.why!!!!
Oof, enjoy the bags.

Too retarded to sell my calls today. In fact, doubled down. How fuked am I tomorrow
Im a dashpass member and I order through doordash literally 6-8 times/week
But yourself a pizza

I'm scared boys
I'm glad I didn't buy UPST calls this time.

As a PLTR holder, will the universe explode if I buy puts on next earnings?
Cause it‚Äôs up $7 after hours?
COIN?! 

&amp;#x200B;

WTF happened!
I still believe that COIN drop is nothing compared to monthly gains
Please moon TSLA
Is anybody surprised by UPST? There was no rational basis to its stock moving up 300% in 2 months

Earnings needed to be unrealistically high to match the stock's move.
Bruh COIN that shits not even funny bro. -15% on a beat?
I had puts for COIN and PRPL.  Calls for SOFI, I‚Äôm gonna hold through those as well.  I think we print.
that dash reversal, goddamn
Roblox is so shitty and it's 20 years old... wtf is the stock doing it makes no sense
*us
Lol I told you idiots not to bet against DASH
DOORDASH IS THE WORST TRADE DEAL OF ALL TRADE DEALS
Upstart failed to start.
DASH all the way back up and more lol
About time.
GUUUH how tf is Dash up 3.2. I‚Äôm leveraged to the balls on a short position
Any ideas of what would a positive CPI figure for the markets? Anything below 6%?

COIN dying out there
LRC ü§ù GME

We got more to go down the rest of this week

I want to pour one out for my UPST calls brothers. Anyone else remember the guy who bought puts on UPST couple months ago. He was right just too early
Guaranteed she got inside info Months before something hits Coinbase and loads up multiple 10-20x baggers . Her only obligation is to pump the stock
I‚Äôm dizzy just watching this Fubo action üòµ üòµ üòµ
3 months? More like 1 year
Yeah I almost bought a put to cover my shares but it‚Äôs fine. Q4 will be better with üåΩ at ATh
Lol DoorDash going up to kill all the puts
The fucks is with wverythin even without earning just dropped ah
All over

Damn. Wonder what Rivian is gonna trade at. Tempted to grab a 100 but it‚Äôll probably be best to wait.
I mean realistically if you shorted every earnings this week you‚Äôd be killing it right? Obviously some losers mixed in but generally we are dumping.

Time to load up on Coin tomorrow. Their Q4 earnings are going to be insane.

Made a last minute decision to buy 327.5 puts for COIN and on God I put the order in and missed it by like 10 seconds. Furk
Always goes opposite lol
UPST still bleeding
I really hope this falls another day just to see the loss porn.
Alright, can we go back to watching SPY go up instead of down then sideways? i got some 470c that expire next week that would appreciate it

Excellent work boys we destroyed DASH
TSLA bears are so cute. Tesla makes $20,000 in profit on every "cheap" car they sell. And they're vertically integrated the way no other carmaker is, plus their growing energy and utility business.

  
The only downside of owning TSLA is that Elon's tweets can instantaneously wipe out 20% of your stock value.

Bought 1 PUBM 45c 12/11 before close for 17$ (0.17). Any wizards in here tell me if that's doing well AH
Good buying opportunity to add UPST tomorrow  üëçüèº
dropped $1K on PTON shares. absolutely stupid price rn
Yeah it's a risk. My reasoning for the drop off is the recent big run up. I expect it to roll back under 18. I've got puts but if it rolls back I'll be buying calls, I like it long term. Just think 3rd quarter will be rough.
DASH LITERALLY ALWAYS FAILS ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)

#AFFIRM ABOUT TO DUMP
Thank you for your donation to the market
distro?
of all the stocks why the fuck is dash surviving such a clown market lmao
Unity unanimously down
So your down ?
Just like AMC
I guess we‚Äôll find out. First time for everything
Does anyone know what happens if i am marked a second time as a pattern day trader but just did a deposit to go over 25K????
So why people selling UPSTart when they made money and positive?
theta-fucked so far.
straight to hell lmfao
market is rigged
Ooof
RIP basically everyone who was bullish for most of today‚Äôs earnings. Can‚Äôt wait to grab some entries after some of these crash.
Bottom line is everything rally
Now that soon sold his TSLA stock the dip is over right?
I'm putting $200 in, just out of curiosity. But I'll be watching like a hawk and will take a day trade hit as soon as I think its run is ending.
LMAO, POSH IPO'ed at $42
You were warned on COIN! Next up to collapse: SOFI
I guess SPY needs to see the CPI numbers tomorrow morning to get it
[deleted]
What fucking day is the Rivian IPO?  I probably want to fuck with it but I thought it was today it‚Äôs hard to find an answer even in the recent news articles on raising opening price
Will NIO be the diamond in the rough? I'm praying to Pooh.
WYNN BEAT üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
What do they do?
probably be back under 300 eow
RIP to WYNN puts
ü§£
60C expiring this week lmao
What the fuck is happening to fubo??? Dumping before anything is released lawwwwwwd. Even more nervous now
Chill with that
The fact that spy only dropped .3% when Tesla collapsed 12% says how little Tesla means for the S&amp;P
One minute? Try 1 second..
BUY WYNN NOW!!!

Dear President Biden, Nancy Pelosi, IRS and JPow-  
  
Submitted is my request for a tax refund on my gargantuan unrealized capital losses incurred today. Please send the refund to me for the entirety of my tax paying life, by April 15th, or you will receive heavy penalties and fines. There are payment plans available if you cannot pay in full.  
  
Regards,  
  
(Really)Deadmoney313
&gt; No, SDC is not a good investment.
Are we going into a correction?  Cuz i have a fuck ton of IWM calls and i cant afford to lose right now

Bought PUBM at 3:58 then sold $40c‚Äôs against at 3:59. Gonna get them called away but $8/share profit üòÆ‚Äçüí®
I talked to RH support today and the guy told me I understand options really well. And then I realized the difference between understanding options conceptually and being able to execute strategies on an administrative level, and actually being good at day trading options on a profitable level
ü§ì
Bag holders about to be made
Holy fck took a small loss on my coin call, didnt have a good feeling abt earnings, needed to be too good to go up anymore phew dodged a bullet
Fucked by UPST and COIN
Just found out I‚Äôm off Thursday. Now I can trade with no fucking distractions finally
I'm telling Santa rally üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ cherr up
PLTR call, not much but it should recover some grounds this week.
[deleted]
lol my $100 SAVA by eow bet def getting me banned now . Haha oh well that won‚Äôt hurt as bad as these $380c bought at close for coin at open tomorrow.
Yup, for years
Foooord! 'folio is full of Ford stock and calls and my garage is full of an old 70's Ford truck I'm rebuilding. I'm a fanboy.
Doesn't count. You enjoy being pegged
UPST FUCK I KNEW IT BUT WAS TOO PUSSY TO BUY PUTS
Oh no AFRM wrong way after hours
POSH fuken ded. WOW.
WTF is after hours? It takes these people one minute to read an earnings report and adjust positions accordingly. What's going on here?
UPST is downstarting
Oof I can‚Äôt win, all in tsla, Elon tweets. Coin base miss. Imma sit out for a while
60M+ volume. Average volume is 30M in TSLA. We get it Elon, u sold today
My FUBO and COIN shares are frikking dead. But I‚Äôm happy that the stupid overvalued POS stock UPST is dying too üòíüòíüòí
Thank god I did not actually put that $5k on coin calls I would be fucking kissed

Pissed
Took my SDC remains and put then into ‚Äúcorn mining‚Äù stocks today.  Ready for the üöÄüöÄüöÄ
You say that like it means anything in this market. It could end the week at 1500 and I wouldn't be slightly surprised.
RIVN launching at 74? Seems high to me.
just remember these puts hit different
Can't stop the TWNKs
Posh.... I mean come on.
Ford out here averaging 100M+ a day. 40 eoy
All the booties go clap üëèclap üëè
Guh to my coin calls. Shoulda sold for a profit before close.
[deleted]
I bought a deep OTM weekly call last minute for fun. 
 
Edit LOL FUCK YEAH
CB wallet is decent
No way around it, if you didn't short TSLA at $1200, you hate money.
The MM reapers are here collecting souls‚Ä¶
I had $450 calls 11/12 calls. Good thing I bitched out and bought $300 puts to hedge right before close. Hope this shit tanks now.
RNG taking off
&gt; I'm a hedge fund trader.
So the meta is in. ER = destruction (except for RBLX)
Some.. times in our lives

We all have pain

Probably the same people bagholding since $400
Too far OTM or too soon expiry, u fuked
FUBO is FUBAR
UPST going REEEEEE^(EEEeeeeeeeeeeeeee)
Selling is transitory
RIP PRPL gang
Wait wtf I though PLUG reported this morning? Why is only just now tanking?   

I mean, im short a couple hundred so I'm not mad.
Today fucken sucked. Still happy about roblox though.
I have a 12/17 335c so I could in theory hold it out, but if the consensus isn‚Äôt good then it‚Äôll be heading into the 200‚Äôs
Dropped 13k (38%) at open but managed to get myself up 1.5k (4%) by close. What a fucking day
Cathie will double down on it
she sold some yesterday, she was right for a change!
id be back to working for them
[https://raybb.github.io/random-stock-picker/](https://raybb.github.io/random-stock-picker/) found this. first one I tried was carvana, WSB has seemingly played everything at this point
Anyone buying the Rivian IPO?
Is it healthy or unhealthy that I lost more today than some people make in 3-4 months and I‚Äôm only angry versus throwing up and looking for ROPE?
50 Lashes!
Someone make me feel better about $POSH
Coinbase Q3 21 Earnings: 
- Revenue: $1.31B (exp $1.57B) 
- EPS: $1.61 (exp $1.68) 
- Monthly Transacting Users: 7.4M (exp 7.09M) 
- Trading Volume: $327B (exp $308.88B)
what is going on with FUBO? earnings arent even out lol
Fortunately it isn't as hyper inflated as UPST but yea I'm scared
*Checks COIN* -3% for the week. Huh
I'm honestly excited for RIVIN tomorrow 


Like PS5 dropping
lmao sux for the COIN bros
üòÇüçª
Didnt they actually have a good earnings? Beat on revenue, closer to break even on their coverage, etc?
$WISH is up but my port is down, the markets are rigged.
Rip Unity
U down 11% AH.  that can‚Äôt be good.  That‚Äôs gonna hurt bad tomorrow morning.
$DASH is shit
#UPST BOIS DED
using Linux as desktop is like fucking a fat girl. she is fat and ugly but she suck hard
I did that a few weeks ago. No regrets here
same gl
can my dash puts do what coin did plz
bad five minutes to be a COIN and U holder ‚ò†Ô∏è
If PLUG could also go the COIN route that'll be great.
Lmaooo so focused on how tesla closed that I totally forgot about my coinbase call to take profit on before earnings. When it rains it pours brothens
UPST symbol change to DNST
If doordash moons I quit
F for COIN, UPST, SKIN
One of my best moves of the year. Watching from the sidelines... Have I learned something, nah, I will probably double up on my stupid plays tomorrow
It‚Äôs fucking nuts out there boys‚Ä¶UPST / COIN / FUBO
[deleted]
Ford tomorrow baby
Wow, they're really moving FUBO around after hours and before earnings release. Big spike up and now tanking. I have a put which is looking good now for tomorrow since it's now at $29
Wow upst
ARKK gonna need some Flex Seal ¬Æ
You‚Äôll get‚Äôem next time tiger! I believe in you bro.
[deleted]
RIP the two guys with UPST YOLOs, this isn‚Äôt the end guys
And Hut 8. They own more retarded internet money than RIOT. But maybe it‚Äôs not so retarded if it keeps coming back from the dead every time just to break new ATHs?
Everything rally tomorrow
Watch doordash moon lol
For raped by PYPL. So farm my 11/12 COIN 330p contracts are looking good. But the way my luck has been going, I'll get raped there as well
Buy more $PLTR because I hate money
UPST missed EPS by like 80% lol
DASH Puts about to make me rich or poor
When are DASH results out?
UPST = KILL
Maybe we should just name tickers that reported ER and aren't shitting the bed in AH because damn.
Well shit. So COIN puts were the move
why tmrw exactly?
WYNN just fired their CEO.
[deleted]
Yes, they are going to buy $PYPL and $COIN.
Yeah, but once? Literally every earnings call I get destroyed. I‚Äôd rather close the position and see it the next day at this point, even if it means missing out on that.
Someone tell me how NIO and Taboola did in earnings.  I‚Äôm too scared to check my portfolio.
[deleted]
LOL at the dude who got dash puts lol.
Nice, i'm catching it at 180 tomorrow.
Getting paid boatloads of cash to spew bullshit and never be accountable if I'm wrong? They're laughing all the way to the bank man.
I did
[deleted]
NVDA. Take the sure thing. Not the massively overvalued rollercoaster.
Getting scared for SOFI, unless they have some crack ass guidance and bank charter, shit is gonna tank
FUBO, COIN, UPST all absolutely slaughtered after hours :(
holy shit dude. I wish I was you.
Ah, gotcha, GG
Glad I sold my COIN 400C for a small 400 profit. Damn lol. IV crush main reason I sold
lmao. 3k in SDC calls yesterday. 4K in Roku calls today. GG all. I'm done for a bit
You are supposed to thank us for attending your TED talk.
Expected 1.68. also seeing 1.79.
HOly shit. Fuken BLOODBATH ah. jESUS pls have mercy on these call holders.

WHO SAID BUY UPST COIN U FOR 20X GAIN WHO SAID THAT TELL ME RIGHT NOW
This kills the COIN
i need everybody in GO it‚Äôs an emergency
I hope tomorrow will be better but it's highly unlikely
!banbet AMD 165 2d or I'll let my gf peg me
Man why does it feel like the recent run is about to end lol
My $850p is just lovin this shit.

-31% at close yesterday, +92% today. Selling at +500% or rolling it forward if it doesn't make it.
damn, got 3/3 on earnings correct..plug,coin and U puts yeahhh
Rivin
I got 10 at .33.  IV crush will kill it unless we hit 36 or lower
They didn‚Äôt bother making any money last quarter
Some analyst says Sofi should beat earnings pretty well. 

Goes to check Analyst‚Äô success rate: 54% 

Fuck me, might as well have flipped a coin. What fucking good does that do? Lol
you sound like my mom
cathie wood touched coinbase so its demise was inevitable
I wanted to do this but procrastinated and then market closed. Godspeed!
COIN wtf dude
Astroworld stock too strong, i think they knew we all had puts

lol that's big brain strike

could happen its TSLA after all
It sucks Bc COIN is a great bullish stock but my god playing earnings are so fucking brutal. Retards are gonna wake up to -90% on calls. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
WYNN not winn
fubo numbers out yet?
You're so smooth I love it
Lol the sentiment in the daily today was bullish on COIN and bearish on DASH. Guess we know what's coming...
What about that Internet hamster who was the winning stock Picker?
Ooof I slept all day can't beleive TSLA is down 12 percent thats fucking brutal
You're only surprised if you were watching coin prices instead of coin volume.
You're lucky to still have her around, man.  Give her a kiss for me.

[deleted]
Thank fuck I sold my unity call for a 10% profit.
Yeah but you're acting like COIN is good?
its tricky, cause they have high chances to win in 2035, but will likely collapse in 2030 but Xi wants to do it sooner vs leave it to the next leader but Biden is easier anything can happen
why did i yolo unity
Even theta gang got chopped up today
$COIN announced tapering early
Can anyone explain why NVDA is such a big deal in the comments today? It doesn't even seem like it moved all that much. Like over the week I get it but today specifically, I was expecting it to be up like $200 based on the comments

How did DoorDash go?
Timing is everything. Glad you‚Äôre not getting drilldoed right now.
Coin sales 1.24bn, consensus 1.57bn. Ouch.
It‚Äôs as cheap as dirt. Really don‚Äôt think it can go lower than this but it might pull some retard shit on us.
Should have known better than to buy COIN on Robinhood‚Ä¶tried to dump right away at like 335 and got hung up in the stupid ass ‚Äúwould you like to set a limit order üòÄ‚Äù interface‚Ä¶

Guess I‚Äôm a bag holder now üëç
$ELY
is there a random stock picker algo somewhere? wondering if i'd have better luck yolo-ing into that than my own stupid calls
thanks to PYPL, COIN and U, my options account is once again blown up. $ROPE it is
PRPL dying gives me a lot of nostalgia
Hope PLUG either keeps dropping or stays this low at least. Grabbed puts in the last 60 seconds of trading, lmao. Way OTM (35p) so it won‚Äôt be crazy gains unless it drops a lot more but at least a little boost. Was hoping it would pull an SDC or something

implied move was 9.7% for COIN so if ur FD puts are ITM you might be gucci

UPST is 15% so its getting there...
I would pay at least $10 to get blown by her.
COIN Theta Ganging both call and put holders , the dump is not large enough , 2x if you bought ATM puts if it stays at 325
I wonder if Cramer still likes COIN up to 475
Did she buy coin? Dumb shit lmao
[deleted]
PRPL fd puts looking good
lol everything is getting hammered
COIN dive!
TSLA is an actual cringe stock. It could be 1/5 of its current valuation and it would still be overvalued. Literally Bitcoin-tier.
wtf coinbase? why!!!
RIP to the people who thought U would do the same as RBLX
I actually loaded up on wynn puts at open and it's shaping up to be the greatest trade I have ever made
Address?
The name Coinbase does sound like it should be a penny stock
Locked in a spy FD call just before that increase in volume at market close ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
I think she sold all $24 million in COIN recently
$coin and $pypl may get bought buy $pins at this rate.
Ate all the dips today. Really hoping it doesn‚Äôt blow out my colon tomorrow.
address?
#UPST PUTS PRINTING
Oh shit Tesla got
Murdered
First time it dips after earnings. That was an over reaction. Though my calls are in shambles
POSH GUH. Goddamn glad I sold. PDT or not.
Today is the type of day that makes me want to just take my huge losses, cash out, and just buy SPY shares. 

I got fucked super hard today.  And it‚Äôs not even over for me today since I‚Äôm a COIN bag holder too.
she‚Äôs still up huge on her average cost btw
Is this clown market gonna fuk my PLUG 35p?
You will be rich
Had 265 cc I sold out of lol.  Whew.
Should come to rest @ 311. If no?! üìâ
Amzn wrecked me on Q2 earnings so I feel your pain‚Ä¶.
Tsla can lose 80% here and is still considered over valued, think about that before doubting it‚Äôll drop a mere 10-15% from here.
That‚Äôs what my calls from yesterday thought too ü§°
[deleted]
Is this the open source gaming software/VR package, or is there another Unity?
She‚Äôs charging too much.  $3.50 is all she‚Äôs worth.

Omg twinsüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I so f*cking knew it! Should have sold my COIN ü™ô shares in my 401k before earnings. The hype surrounding it was so much that it had to tank, classic wsb style üòíüòíüòíüòí
All my $COIN fell in the GUHtter ü§°

$coin should buy $pins
RiP poshmark, fly high lil guy
At least UPST is dying. Thank god
Next bear catalyst, since someone asked in the just-closed thread:  China invades Taiwan.  I'd give it a 10% chance of it occurring this year, if it doesn't, 30% in 2022.  NOC and LMT are the plays, as well as SPY puts.

I don't see Biden, Kamala, or the paper tigers of the Squad being very effective deterrents.  Trump would have thrown 2 million American lives away without thinking twice, just to make Xi pay for his bid; our country is for the moment run by weaklings who can't even get it together to pass a tax-and-spend bill, much less send the flower of American chivalry overseas.  So if it's going to happen Xi is best poised to do it before our next major election.

LOL COINNN
Wtf I'm I reading this right coin expected EPs was 6.42 they reported 1.62

Me yoloing COIN ü§°
Considering taking some profits from TTD tomorrow. Anyone else in on TTD long term? 

I‚Äôve seen this run up / run down quite a bit on earnings over the last couple years. The runup from this earnings is crazy but it‚Äôs been pushed up what 40% in 2 days?
Rip purple gang for those who remember lol
Everyone who has ever attacked me for expressing my concern about COIN as a company that's what your pp looks like
why'd you feel the need to comment this twice today?
its shorts with 2% stop loss. so the worse can happen is i lose 2.4k or so.

not nearly as risky as buying put options that can go to ZERO and you can't trade in AH
Too many of these insane downward moves happening now‚Ä¶
Daily reminder that my üÖøÔ∏èüÖøÔ∏è is smaller than yours
When does DASH report
Via some miracle my Tesla FD is still green
At least you guys didn‚Äôt buy posh calls right market close expecting food earnings smh.
ER bloodbath
Lmao coin that's just fucking impressive
This is one of the most entertaining earnings seasons I‚Äôve seen, and I was an analyst for work. 

Just straight vertical lines up and down everywhere you look lmao.
Holding my $TSLA 11/19 900 and 12/17 1100 PUTs.
AH Bloodbath incoming!

LMFAO COIN LEGIT HUNG ITSELF ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Now your turn DASH
I told you I have everything in COIN puts, I was half lying but I'm still gonna get some spicy returns.
oh FUCK ME COIN
Bought 1 call to join the SDC
love the way the chart shifts down on ToS as it drills
Sweet, gonna buy back my COIN covered calls for pennies tomorrow morning.
Except for the ones that don‚Äôt.
# üåàü¶Ñ?????
What happened to PLUG AH??
Long? DED
$PYPL bound for a bounce back correction
Dash still too high imo
Holy miss Coinbase!
COIN... how low can you go!
Glad got fkd yesterday and not today

Coin digging for pltr
When playing ER it's always the stocks that nobody expects to rip or tank that make the biggest moves.

COIN off a cliff!
NVDA always![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Plug puts is an easy play
Apparently sold yesterday and switched to BABA calls
Fuck you coin
RIP Coin call holders
&gt; SPY is legally allowed to have two consecutive red days.
I‚Äôm starting to agree. I bought 350c 11/12 COIN which are gonna be worthless.
Seriously fuck you COIN. Why did I buy this retarded IPO. Once Robinhood has wallets they are gonna be completely screwed.
Going all in on F and LCID
Rip COIN
Ouch. Coin.
RBLXüíéü§≤üèªüíéthought about getting out @109 but you don‚Äôt sell a glorious close like that.  Will gap up again premarket tomorrow, probably sell at open.
Is SPY legally allowed to have two consecutive red days?
FUBO! FUBO! FUBO!
I‚Äôm disappointed in Brian
Same
Jk 11/19

Let‚Äôs see where the $Coin clowns at ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
oh god COIN what is you doin bb
Cleaned out my cash, bought tsla and ptra
Last time TSLA was down worst than today was 9/08/2020
Coin base was up 30% for the month. You didn‚Äôt expect it to‚Ä¶ go up did you??
Damn I was wrong about coin ü§£
Hahahaha‚Ä¶.11/12 245c Pypl ‚Ä¶..üò≠ I have good loss porn coming soon‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm selling hand / feet pics on my Onlyfans
Fuck it lets dance elon,
Bought $1200 11/26 on close
COINBASE, ouch üòì
Loaded up IWM calls EOD ü™ì
Oh wow. Who did coin piss off?
And my single call on coin is worthless lol.  Thought for sure I‚Äôd be ok with the rise in crypto.
Props, it‚Äôs for the gamblers that want to take a break if they‚Äôre wrong, of the dummies that put in a number wrong and we all get to laugh
Probably the easiest money of your life
Ouch
To die. To just die. Failure be thy name.
I've figured out how to fool the market, sell part of your holdings in a shit stock and see the other half moon by 15 percent, still leaving you holding bags, just feeling stupider than before.
RIP
Hedged my DASH puts by opening a doordash drivers account, I‚Äôll either make trendies or be delivering them üìà
Congrats to anyone listened to me to buy plug puts 8 mins ago
Shout out AGC, and shout out Christina Applegate.
Where is PLTR calls guy? He $ROPE yet?
[deleted]
What always happens to PLTR, that's what.
Okay bears you ate enough back to hibernation you go
COIN üí©
Bought COIN 11/12 $300p at close. Hopefully they print
should I keep my Sofi shares through earning?
Watch what u wish for.
$ACB üëÄ
Sorry. No can do.
Oof Coin
RIP ME
So, I‚Äôm guessing COIN had a bad ER.
$60k into either:

TSLA 1200c Jan 22
NVDA 325c Mar 22

Been having great luck all year with nvidia but Tesla is appealing. Thoughts?
Well I‚Äôm fucked. I will never have a position going into earnings ever again. COIN and PYPL thank you for this learning experience, so stupid
the only way up from here is down
[deleted]
If there is a 5 split that is 420.
Literally all earnings go down now. Easy money
Rip
A sense of pride and accomplishment
Someone tell me what's going on w CB
Toss a coin to your witcher... or in this case to the market makers who just fucked y'all in COIN calls
Wooooow
couldn't decide which SPY calls to buy

hopefully i get a chance in morning
Guh, thank god I couldn‚Äôt afford the calls
COIN DD was on point congrats with the üåΩ that‚Äôs what stopped me from getting a Put
TSLA calls at close. :D
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) for COIN holders... that hurts.
NIO Calls or Puts? I'm 0/4 this week on earnings.
COIN. now we know where drill team six was assigned today.
You can
Hold Lucid ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
OUCH SHITCOIN
if you're reffing to SPY, this was absolutely not a "pullback"....that will be tomorrow and the next day
RIP COIN HODLERS
Get this. I thought COINs earnings were yesterday AH so I bought calls. Realized it was today and sold this morning for 80% gain. That is some legitimately retarded shit
if PLUG could drop another $8 that would be neat
Oh no!
bullish on fb long term, but man 13% down on my leaps hurts
Bagholder spotted.

Look at that drilldo on COIN
Wish for my TSLA call to stop bleeding
Nah uh!
I wish I could see the percentage of retail holding a stock so I can avoid it.
If my calls (all red since Monday) are still down in the morning I will liquidate my account and take it to the actual casino. $200 blinds I can lose or make money faster.
What in the actual fuck happened to PLTR today?

thought i would be able to by a jumbo pack of crayons for my family to eat by end of day but nooooo
Where were you when coin is die?
I am not fucking selling my SOFI
Imagine not buying PayPal at the bottom when I bought. Imagine üåà ü¶Ñ
holding these SPY puts overnight![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)

BB wasn't so bad
Well, thank you for helping my puts grow!

Guh
AMD and SPY launching to the moon üåùüåö
TSLA could drop 80% and STILL be overvalued. Think about that for a minute.
[deleted]
COIN lol
All meme stocks got shorted to max pain lol
Well yeah
[deleted]
Hoping my spy 469 calls print for the memes.
You are so convinced in your thesis that Dash is going to miss earnings that you put 120K into an earnings play?

Goddamn you belong here
I bought a Roblox put yesterday ü§°
COIN WITH THE FAKE OUT LETS GO
Unity pls make me rich
CPI gonna carry us
Sold my puts near the bottom and grabbed some spy calls today. Hopefully I can let go of them for a positive return tomorrow.

50th
Just bought DASH puts. Should I prepare the lube now?
Swapped 11 TSLA shares for a june23 $2100c
Make a ban bet, coward.
Imagine thinking Tesla was going to go up when my own mother sold the top and bought NIO at the bottom. FUCKING IMAGINE BEING WORSE AT TRADING THAN MY BOOMER MOM üåà ü¶Ñ
Affirm. Gooooo
the market is rigged
My asshole is bleeding
/r/thetagang: Farming the degenerate fucks ain‚Äôt much but it‚Äôs honest work.

/r/wallstreetbets: SPY dips 0.33%, ‚ÄúJPow and Elon are false gods‚Äù

/r/investing: Unironically buying bonds.

/r/options: Eating the same paint they chart with.

/r/stocks: Trading on Robinhood with public library WiFi.

/r/dividends: Using Find My iPhone to see that his wife‚Äôs boyfriend took her to Applebees. It was Olive Garden last week.
This is where the fun begins
Welp. My WYNN puts are locked in. Let's see if we can beat the house.
I hope y‚Äôall motherfuckers bought the dip. CPI still a wildcard but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll be fine. Probably. Lol.
What do people gain if they win these ban bets anyways?. Serious question.
BCRX about to break resistance. Hope y‚Äôall loaded up on that dip
Come on PLUG! DUMP DUMP DUMP!
Just loaded up before close ü§û
Time to delete the app and reinstall windows
Very bullish close on Spy . Tomorrow we gap higher on cpi report
I didn't know what to buy so I bought root lmao, I should stick to my job of top flight security lol
i lost 10k shorting RBLX ytd. and i shorted another 120k worth of DASH today. so you guys will probably know what will happen lol
I barely survived today. Praying Green tomorrow !
BALLS DEEP IN FUBO LETS GO
That was painful
\*crayons
Gold and silver
Spy calls right at close. Please suck me and not fuck me.
[deleted]
AMD ripping to 175 tmw

Save me NIO you‚Äôre my only hope
Well that was a GUHHH
Loss porn
Sad realization: I belong here.
Buying PYPL here because there's no way it can go any lower.

2 minutes later: ü§°üî´
Anyone remember the video of the World of Warcraft kid that tried shoving a remote up his ass? That's what today felt like
AMD y u no rip more
TSLA is going sub $1000 tomorrow
Can we turn SPY back on?
Coin

Sofi single handely keeping my portfolio green
JESUS FUCK
When in doubt zoom out
Better than a slow death like this pos. See ya
no public gitlab we can send patches to?
What did I miss? How did we start crazy green and end red?
QQQ let’s see that 200 day this week at 341 buddy. You gotta stick it in. Just the tip to see how it feels.
hopefully they weren't 0DTE
You are correct Sir! Bad even with baked numbers all week, Japan stopped Printing money today, the UK will follow next week.
fuck it. i tried to help. google, "Is BABA an ADR?" gl, bud
Aaand now the market is closed
Bought spy calls 2 minutes before close 
-7% on those guys at close. Holy fuck

Spy super bullish if you invert the chart

It's still time to buy $SPXY, I'll tell when it's time to buy spy.
My 450 calls are looking like some hardcore shit right about now. Ima just sit my ass down and cry in a corner until the 15th then cry some more when actually realize how fucked I am
The sub is full of PROG, which is 200M market cap as far as I can see, more worrying than clov retards from my point of view
Ehh clov is good long haul
But I don’t see it going past 9/10 by end of the year
That spy free fall was fucking retarded
I’ll give you a blowie if it’s $22 EOD tomorrow
60k portfolio and it ends at -15$

lmao. this market is so trash such a waste
I don't know what any of that means but I think you're either jealous or FUD.
Who that?
And its red….
These $437p for 10/13 are already printing wtf
When is mommy coming home from her shift at the diner? I miss her sweet sweet juices 

Edit: damn I’m drunk. I was trying to antagonize someone with a reply. Comment still stand on its own though lol
SPY not even bothering to bounce today
Yeah I'm not super concerned, threw in a small buy on the first "dip" today and have been watching it shrink hah.
Man I thought I bought calls at the dip
And me account ded
Looks like spy’s ER failed to meet expectations.
[deleted]
everyone here is fucking stupid. You're either stupid and unlucky or stupid and lucky. The only part in your control is greed- dont be greedy and you'll make money. The funds/banks have days/weeks/months/years to make their plays. Everyone here is focused on 8-100 hours away. Don't do that. Make stable long term bets that are reasonable.   


most importantly- "dontquitchadayjob"
Bought spy calls 😈
Take care, seriously
I rode some 0DTE 439C early in the morning, made some money and logged off. Should've grabbed some puts before logging off, oh well!
Look at clov tho
I bought 440 oct 25 calls. Yikes
[deleted]
Real and straight market today
And that's just the opening price. $22 eod, 25+ eow
I'm sure if I sell for a loss it's gonna moon but if I hold they will expire worthless
Feeling rich now so it’s steak for dinner but tomorrow if the markets up it’s back to rice and beans
AFRM looks like a good buy, easy 150-160 long term especially with holidays around the corner.
Ah bipolar day!
End of day GUH.

Person 1: "Quick, dump it all!"

Person 2: "Into what?!?!
OMG it’s a bloodbath.
Aye, fuck me for being so bad at this. Congrats to the Berz for all your gains. Wish I was 🌈 but I haven't started swinging that way yet.
Real baba bulls aren’t concerned with day to day price action we know where it’s going on the future
🌈
Why is it so hard for SPY to stay green nowadays , I want the old SPY CEO
Because I am your father? Sorry son.
Started from the bottom, now we're even lower.
Learn how to play both sides lol
Can I interest you in my 450 weeklies?
Guess I should have closed TSM calls on the AM pump and re entered here
Wow, literally no end to this.  I'm so fucked, should have taken the out two days ago, Friday, or earlier today but nope so fucked.
What wait huh what happened today? Japan’s Gobmnt officially stopped printing money. QE became DOA.
Bulls going to have to become Lot Lizards to make up for their losses after this pull back.
We had a day not so long ago that was way worse than this.  Like a 2% drop on QQQ.  Used to it by now 😭
The line be goin down and to the right
Lmao

I really told y’all SDC was finna dump today but y’all ain’t want to listen

WTF SPY WHYY
Really? I thought you guys were saying it was gonna be at like 9 or 10 by now
SOFI to $40 by the Superbowl held in SoFi stadium
I don’t even like sdc but just bought 50 calls because that shit is going to pop once y’all get your money cleared tomorrow
Bruh I would of lost half my portfolio if I didn’t pull out this morning lol the loss porn would of been epic tho
Puts weeklies…good chance we see a -1% day
[deleted]
#BRACK FRIDAY BUNDURU
Waking up to SOFi at $20 tomorrow morning
That’s the bright side to Robinhood. Almost the only bright side instant margin
Lol do people in here still think evergrande isn’t a non event? That’s funny
[deleted]
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4272)
A vehicle to separate retards and their money
If we can agree that there’s an abundance of overly shorted stocks, why can’t we agree that the overuse of that margin is causing the sp500 to weaken?
GIVE ME SOMETHING. I NEED A DOUBLE
Today was a perfectly balanced day. Both bulls and bears got some time in the sun
Less than 1% of day traders are successful
Really just hit 3 pm today and said fuck your power hour
Anyone going into TWNK?
I’m on 445. FD for the win. Only down 6k on them
Even the end of day crackheads wont touch this shit
From +7k to +1k. At least I'm still green but goddamn this retarded mkt
Yeah I know, baba looks good rn I don’t see it going below 130-140. Good hold for long haul
or a bull run, but most likely MM and theta gang win
Still a Green Day of clov. Love it. 10/15 $10c still very doable by EOW. $11 nets me a 10 bagger. LFG 🚀🚀🚀
[deleted]
yes where you can lose 40% in one minute, do it! (and no halts to stop the pain!)
Oh shit the airline industry is really going under rn I’m a little nervous for actual air travel  but puts are gonna print lmao
last week startin to look like the fattest, juiciest bull trap there ever was. no bull trap is has ever been fatter or juicier, it's really somehting. we've got the best bull traps in the world and everyone i know thinks so, everyone loves it, it's fantastic!
You seriously think that is why I said that?  Bro, you got anger issues
Keep at it!! You’ll get there eventually. I’m in deep on $CLOV right now. Hoping that pays off
I just bought some $WISH at $4.90. Fuck my ass but I think it's actually a pretty good price for a dumpster fire of a company. Like gamestop, there is a non-zero chance of righting the ship.
Has there been a class action law suit against Robin Hood yet? I owned GME through them back in January of 2020. If there is a law suit how do I join in?
Suffocation, no breathing 📉
I thought that dumped like weeks ago?

EDIT: Nevermind, I just checked the chart. I did get in and out of SDC really fast right when it first blew up though. Usually if things are being pumped here that's your sign to take some profits quickly and get the fuck away from that ticker.
This is nothing compared to last Monday.
Open a cash account somewhere, dumbass
I’m gonna have to see that small dick club loss porn boys ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Hey Soul bull brother 😀👋, aint that mister powell 🤔 on the radio 📻 stereo, crashing the market 📉 ain’t fair ya know 😒
Baba will be fine I wouldn’t consider selling anything for a few years
Can we rally in to the close olease
Straddle her to death
Can't keep up 😀
Evergrande touched me here *points to doll butthole*
RH doesn't say anything about an ADR. Unless you have some proof you sound kinda dumb. Not trying to be rude. I've only been investing a few weeks and I know more than you.
Only Fams
Sell the strike below your buy, lock in those gains!
Spy up .20 from lows rally time
What is it what is it?
huh? WTF is this??
Taking any profits at 9:30 tomorrow fuck this
Psh, March 2020 made me feel like a perm-victim on svu. Time heals all, that and bankruptcy.
maybe for you
PROG up 60% again. Gonna wait until it goes down to 1.3 again and load because its always doing this every single week
Yes
It’s one day game after and pre market that’s it
yikes at what? it wa sinevitably going back down here.
Small dick club has failed yet again, curse my small pp
Fuck me baba. You suppose to hit 170s today!!! It’s okay China man got my back by end of week
umm nope theyre rich
They stopped months ago
Good sir, the back of the doomsayers line is that way, stop trying to cut!
I got 6 minutes of hope not giving up !!
435 gap close

Calls it is
adding more sdc here. so predictable. was looking at 5.95 as next bottom
Well fuck you too MSFT. Should have sold for my 3% gain
Song parody for all the tards in here losing their ass on the overpriced American indexes
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Gap is getting fill down
Money = lost
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
SDC…yikes
Real shit can someone mentor me? I’m trying to quit my job I hate my 9-5 shit
Why because I disagree with you? Lol welcome to America homie.
Evergrande lurking in the shadows:

**Soon™**
When I heard power hour I didn’t know that meant I was going to be a power bottom.. fuck this hurts
how is AAPL still green
to balance out karma, I upvoted this and downvoted your vegan comment
If today doesn’t scare the hell out of bulls I don’t know what will.
I concur doctor
Hey Bulls.

It doesn't hurt to be a little bear-curious.
Fed stop buying HYG?
[deleted]
Tried to buy puts at 440 but my funds weren't settled yet. Absolute bullshit. They'll settle tomorrow and I'll FOMO my ass right into insolvency.
LEAS - check out the one month chart. Looks positioned for a serious move up. With money returning to OTC a mega move up is likely.
My calls are up 20%. We break 22 tomorrow.
Spy puts or calls at close?
🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
Average11 been red everyday
Not possible to be a bull after this action
$CLOV about to flush to 7’s great short
Market wants crash crash
Traders who FOMO’d into puts in absolute shambles
Whats the buy before close
No
The power of SPY puts compels you!
We need a red shrek emoji
I'm actually scared for tomorrow
dip buyers cucked
Easy $425 tomorrow
$399 EOW no problem
Hope your assholes are puckered, we’re gonna retest last weeks lows this week
A crash did happen its over

Only green from here boi
shouldve held my 358 puts
Bond market opens tomorrow and CPI on Wednesday. I’m no fortune teller but I’m pretty sure it’s not gonna be good for the market
Omfgggg spy
bear r still fuk, but i fear that maybe i r now fuk as well
[deleted]
People around here don’t really get the “buy low, sell high” concept
nah, i was saying that the BABA listing information reflects 9988's. i wasn't saying that it's the legit one. just did some more research, and it's an ADR (which is basically as legit as you're gonna get without owning 9988): [https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/stocks/understanding-american-depositary-receipts](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/stocks/understanding-american-depositary-receipts). basically the biggest risk is that if you could get left with nothing, even if baba doesn't go under.
This is your last shot to load RKLB near 14 bucks
I'd like to speak to the manager about returning these 442 calls...
Market got me with the morning bull trap
434 actually times ticking
That damn thing isn’t moving
We did good eh?
If you look at my post history for today, you’ll see that I was warning you fucks many many times.

Okay it’s about to go back up! Buy calls now
Wish me luck bitch! I’m already up 50%
Today’s Chart is one UGLY TURD!
Just turn it into a spread 🤡
Is now a good time to buy spy calls?
What if u/cashflow was poor and lived off of Burger King coupons
Done with market. Going to internet money
I believe they are a "Motley Fool" recommendation
I’m up on Spy puts I bought by mistake but I want calls
Alright boys, we're at the midway point - you going into $440C or $430P for this Friday? I am in the $440C column myself.
Nah you’ll just become a bag holder
ASTS, MVIS
https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/11/business/gas-prices-oil-opec/index.html

You got about 39 min for some cheap oil calls before everything is priced in for the winter, lol
Bears win battles, bulls always win the war .
nothing like having a 100% unrealized gain on a SPY option but not able to lock it in until tomorrow because of PDT... I'm getting more and more convinced if I could day trade I'd be significantly more successful.
Me
I already bought them at 440, thanks.
A crash may happen this week
Never bet against the Dems! 😤
Good thing I decided to buy a spy put.
who in their right mind would touch tht

Congrats and fuck you, cashflow ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
SPY extending the 💄
go to any casino and youll hear the same story
If you want a laugh, go to the Google News search, look up market news within the date range of September through November 2020, and look at how absolutely wrong every article is about the the present market.
I won't give the BABA people a hard time for being so confident 24 hours ago. I won't do it. I'm better than that, I think.
Healthy eod selloff, finally picking up a little volume
Baba is fine just go long
Hahaha wish? Hahaha
Feels good losing all my gains from last week
Close under 435 baby

-69.69 on the DAQ
Anyone got any upcoming news on RKLB? Seems to have a decent floor at 14, but trades super volatile between 14 and 16. Wondering if it's worth an options play or if it's just another meme.
I’m just here to laugh at SDC and their pumpers.

&gt;[Big bearish bets.](https://twitter.com/sentimentrader/status/1447640068672339976?s=21)

&gt;Last week, volume in inverse ETFs averaged 1.75% of total NYSE volume.

&gt;That's a new record.

Whenever something is so obvious that everyone bets on it, the opposite tends to happen. 😅
Balls are slappin on my chin...
Yo do they really tax options gains by 60%?
SPX volume has been in a constant decline for about 1 and a half years now, but yea recently has been very low

Did someone say sentiment change? Plus analyst didn’t expect star upgrade until 2023
please market, just crash more
How bad are the bags? I’m just planning on averaging all the way down on this motherfucker until I see green

Big money needs to get the sand out they pussies and buy the fuckin dip.
You bagholders having fun?
Held my SPY poots all fucking day, from -70% to break even. Only logical thinking is that we tank tomorrow, so I got some calls. Good luck all

Me reading financial advice from WSB posters

https://youtube.com/shorts/weL1R_FC_Eg?feature=share
I find myself downvoting a lot more than usual when I'm holding puts. I don't like that.
This is the longest amount of days it’s been green in a row in 3 months btw
Lamest day ever
Fuck no

This is drilling tomorrow
I would wait to see what happens wednesday before buying calls
So why are we red?
soooooooo this is continuing to go down tomorrow?
Finally said fuck it, and went deep into $PSFE @ 7
hold or sell my puts?
Spy calls anyone ?
Gap nerds we almost there
FUBO, SOFI, PLTR, AMZN, CRM and NET
like last week.
SPY is fucked
Yeah so it's legit.
Time of eod spy calls?
I was agonizing over hanging on to 20k in SPY calls for Friday, glad I let em go. Gonna start avoiding overnights in this market.
Zoom out and rule #4
Say it
Last 3 trading days in particular
You weaklings! Where is your faith? Yeah, I'm bailing too when I get back to green on these SPY calls. If ever.
Frikking A ROKU! Just because I sold cash secured puts doesn’t mean you have to dip below my strike to get assigned 😒😒😒😒
Vix up 5percent
The hype will pass.  It’s not gonna have a material impact on long term growth.  It is a golden opportunity to short into.  Did you start trading yesterday?
Friend of mine without much financial knowledge recently "flipped" some fucking digital tokens with a few k and turned it to 20k

I went from 20k to a few k buying options.
Maybe I should have sold my GME calls when they were ITM

then again I feel that it's going to hit $300 by Friday
What’s a long hold stock you have? Looking to add a couple more

As a bear I feel confident saying bear r fuk - this looks like slow stable drip to convert call holders to put holders before ass blasting everyone as we rise up the remainder of the week
my puts are up 100%, i’m holding
BEATEN WHY FOR?
Sweet just crossed over +20% since opening this account July 21.  SPY is virtually flat overall since that date
go long on $ROPE
TLRY going to single digits ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
That's why you just buy the stock
yea the bulls, if any left
i swear if i read "green futures omg" one more fuckin time.
Tomorrow it will give back today’s gains and then some 7.25 target
It will go crazy post market!

Anyone need help?
AFRM... couldn't break ATH's... so it tanks.

Could be an interesting week.
CNBC after market open is just an infomercial.
My stonks can't even hold gains

Wat do
IV look at vix - most likely cucking people with premiums on puts
Tomorrow it will be 7.60 area
I guess FB really did want to stay down 15%
Damn. Was hoping to unload Apple at 150. 

Guess not
Lol bulls will die in greater numbers when the bonds open
Volume has been garbage for a loooooong time now
I just got a Spy buy signal a candlestick just turned green

No but they do post feet pics for some reason
Totally garbage volume, we're going green tomorrow
Well bois looks like we’re ending negative for the year
The way CLOV just rejected going under $8 is so hot 🥵
You gotta follow options activities and unusual high volumes on penny stocks with low float/market capital
German Sachs downgraded growth for next 2 years but still in another article it says inflation is transitory and buy the dip. Fckrz
I mean i want that as much as the next guy but idk man
Nice
Oof please no more anal gapage
I think you’re spot on for EOD
Me.
Wow all the bulls saying bears are fucked seem to be getting fucked right now. Maybe Tomorrow might be better that bonds are open
What the fuck even is a Palantir
You spelled that name so poetically wrong that maybe the post of an English teacher doing renaissance at a community college is more of your thing.
Zero chance of that happening
One show dipshit.  You are a gullible fool

It seems the idea that inflation is here to stay is starting to set in amongst the markets
Most interesting market action in months. Definitely broke the pattern. Not sure what it means...but something is different.
And puts the same amount OTM cost twice as much
who's diamond handing their spy weekly puts?
Bulls in straight up panic mode. This means that we will drill even more, until their anguished screams are silenced. And then maybe, we take their places, as bears in bull costumes.

One day Superman is flying over the Justice League building and he looks down to see Wonder Woman sprawled out on her back, naked, tanning.  


"Wow she is so hot, if only I can have a chance at that!" He exclaimed to himself. Suddenly a thought occurred to him... "Wait, I am Superman! I can fly down there and have sex with her and fly off so fast she wouldn't even know what happened!" So Superman quickly swoops down, does his business and flies off satisfied.  


Wonder Woman quickly gets up, "What was that, I thought I heard something?"  
  
Invisible Man replies, "I don't know, but my ass really hurts."

IMO it's not going to crash quickly.  Too much liquidity still.

3rd year dental student so I’m somewhat versed with this topic. SDC is garbage and I wouldn’t let anyone I know do it, even if their case was extremely simple. Ortho work is very complex and often requires interdisciplinary treatment planning (must take into account the status of gums, oral hygiene, bone health, etc), none of which happens with SDC. I don’t even think a licensed orthodontist approves your treatment plan. Long story short it’s absolute shit lol real dentists end up repairing the work these garbage companies do. I’ve seen a young patient in their 20’s have almost full mouth extractions after they used some shady ortho company.

LMFAO I thought it was 880 by the sentiment of the retards here
What is said now genuinely was said then ironically. "Iron/diamond hands" was said in jest when holding was obviously the wrong thing to do, etc.
And people wouldn't constantly pump the same one or two stocks.

##new low of the day
Ahh okay, because WISH is absolutely atrocious and selling covered calls is not even worth the premium but selling puts would be more profitable. I saw a video on cash-secured puts and it said if I’m assigned then I need to have whatever the strike price x 100 set aside as collateral. However, aren’t my 100 shares the collateral in the even it goes ITM they will be called away. Correct? My bad if it doesn’t make sense I’m a retard
Where has all the volume gone?

Hey bearorists, munger and buffet just called. They said y’all are totally right about everything you’ve been saying about China the past 30 years and that move of the hang seng index from 500 to 25,000 is for sure fake, you guys should totally take baba and jd to new lows so we can load up..Ermmm…I mean so we can tell you how right you are. Long term charts look so bearish I bet it’s all going to zero any day now. You should totally short it all at the bottom can’t go wrong. Buffet and munger are shit investors anyways right? Weiss has such a better track record full of veracity and honesty lmfao.

I wonder if our Chy-na friends think Electric Money is the answer since their real estate is fuk. They have no chill.
Yeah but you also still need a buyer.  What i’m saying is with theta I don’t see it making a big enough jump to justify selling.  Maybe you could get like 20-30% if it has a really good day.  Hut if you don’t sell on that day you probably will get theta crushed and that expires fairly soon.
Open the markets 24/7. Ban Algo trading.

It’s honestly going to be so fucking funny when most of you are wiped out gambling within 5 years while I’m retired because of fucking China lmfao.

could be interesting, since student loan pause is about to end and I have a felling many people are going to be seeking to re-finance to minimize the disruptions to their budgets.  People have gotten used to not paying, and when that first payment hits people are going to be looking to lower it any way possible.

and although student loan origination is the largest part of SOFI's business today,  the belief is that the growth will come from other areas in the future.

Nothing has fundamentally changed about the telecom services business in the last few months.

TMUS and T have declined as well -- TMUS much *more* in percentage terms, some 20%. TMUS pays zero. If anything, VZ should be down more than TMUS if the dividend is a concern.

Sucks for me, but all I see is the market repricing VZ so that it produces the same real yield it always has.

Hate to say it but Sofi will definitely squeeze
I don't think qqq will make it to 365 by Wednesday... in fact I think most everything would be a bit lower than it is today if the bond markets were open. By thursday we're gonna start seeing the monthly OpEx volatility, as well as some officia numbers which will cause more volatility. I think we're gonna see red days thursday and friday, and into monday morning. By monday afternoon though, unless we get some bigger and better FUD from the media over the weekend, the markets will start to climb. QQQ sometimes takes an extra day to recover, which is why I said to consider rolling your calls out until next wednesday. Or better yet, sell them now, wait for the dump, and buy cheap calls at the bottom.

$SDC looks primed and ready for takeoff 🚀🚀🚀
The trick is to ride the momentum up with calls.
Trading just after the opening bell when you see a clear trend helps. 
Buy 1/2 point OTM calls or puts. (ideally those contracts cheaper than 1.0)
Size in when you see trend confirmation.
Slowly off load your position when you see the 15min volume candle plateauing or when you’re near the Support and resistance. 
Try to exit when the market becomes flat or choppy because they’ll kill the 0dte OTM rly fast.

You’re entitled to that opinion, but the current yield is direct evidence the market doesn’t see the dividend as safe.

You fucking terrorist 🐻s are getting way to excited for spy downturn.

It's a holiday. The market is like half open. 
Tomorrow will be better. By all means buy puts now.

I bet they will be worthless in a day or two
I bout puts as spy was going down in September. Then calls and made profit. But then the next day it went down so I lost profit. Tried to recover but couldn’t .sucked
Start the day up 10k, gonna end down 8 🙃
What’s the price target on MARA?
Lets go bros, all in on BROS
if you ever need a nap just watch the 2021 stock market!
#NLE CHOPPA SAID STOCKS TOO LOW

Fair but have you been cash gang since like early September given its so volatile?

Sofia you uncultured swine
The stock market is the "economy" for rich people and people with a retirement account
It’s not, it’s on youtube and youtube doesn’t have porn
I swear NET is just cheating, it doesnt even feel rewarding anymore
i'm gonna hazard a guess and say most of the bers here get wrecked regularly, and mostly just lose money.
$CLOV 👀🚀🚀🚀☘️🍀☘️
Yeah I had options that skyrocketed today at open and they’ve only gone down. I gotta stop being so greedy and just take a profit when I can.
Buying 5k of spy calls if it sits at 436 at close

I've replied to four posts so far today about Verizon and AT&amp;T. Seriously had to check which sub I was in. Hell, investing doesn't even care about them, that's more /r/dividends/ territory.
which kind of ape are you

Did this mfs ape flair just disappear
Lmao
Florida new cases are way down despite not having any mask/vax mandates 🤯 calls on Florida companies and good luck to the schmucks in California!
then over trade![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Nap time. After I brush my teeth. Just had coffee
/u/zjz bless you for the ape flairs. If only there was a way to filter out commenters that have them.
I still feel SPY 450 in mah plums.
I’m sort of hoping for 750 so I don’t get banned. But hoping more for about 335 so my E Mini short doesn’t make my family homeless.
You mean BABA
Holding up against what??
We shall see
that's because it is porn
I'm so glad I dumped my WISH at $7.60 for a small loss. Best trading decision I made all year
I love how ppl here always say that the economy is not the stock market, and then when you try to tell them they should buy puts, they always say betting against SPY is betting against the American economy.

LMAO, u for real? 

When are you gonna learn that there are more than one strategies of making money out there, and that if you don't try to learn as much as you can before this bull market turns upside down or sideways, you're going back behind the dumpster at Wendy's once that happens...

Bears = Bulls = you = me

Make. Fucking. Money.
Is CCXI still on the naughty list?
Might double back into SPY
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Guilty. Was up 30% this morning and got into some V calls that I then sold as it was on it's way down. Then went into some AA calls that I knew nothing about. sold after 2 minutes when I realized I was being retarded. Bought 11/13 Spy puts to round off the day at the bottom and it's refused to go lower so now theta is fucking me.
The only pump will be bulls taking it worse than Marcellus Wallace
I predicted tendies in the near future for you
We're going to get fked up tomorrow, aren't we?
Under 1 bil market cap means ban from WSB
ive tried trading memes its fucking impossible. movements are so random. prolly the only strategy would be to go long when it drops under 170 and pray you don't get fucked lol
Save us, daddy JPow, youre our only hope
The only pump will be bulls taking it worse than Marcellus Wallace
Pelosi may have been involved in insider trading. I want to know which stocks are going up.
Never inverse dems.
Wsb is wiped
PLTR daily charts look like my account daily chart, +15% &gt; +30% &gt; -70%
Time for FD puts on RIOT... all those youtubers are getting a little too cocky with their "predictions".
I was up this morning and held my calls.  doh!
Wait for EOD dip

You had puts? Lmao
There will be a pump before that
Oh ok. That’s very reasonable. Definitely do the banbet still.
Damn he'll just say whatever huh
im actually bearish on SOFI. main reason is that it doesnt have the growth rate that other fintech companies are offering. the insane multiples dont make sense for their shit growth
When did this place turn into investing dot com?
What's wrong with spy movement. Seems just fine to me.

Hiw does something like that happen? It's almost like you force someone to suck your dik then the take a chunk out to teach you a lesson. Or could just be birth defects. 

I'll watch some criminal minds episodes to see what they say about an unsub like this.
It’s not rocket science 🤡
Probably we're gonna see 430 on Wednesday
At least the bots on Tinder give me hope. 😔
I’m always early.  Just keep cost averaging down
Dumped my fucking $GME puts for a loss. Last time I ever trade a me me stock.
All time low?  Damn. You should definitely do a ban bet.
Wait for Chamath to sell

Damn today was the fakest pump to 440
Wish in one hand, shit in the other.  See which fills first
I sold my position, so yeah probably. Also.. ban bet or ban.
CPI data on Wednesday. Bulls Id start wearing that buttplug I got you for your birthday
When did the market crash? Sp500 is down 0.29% right now.
It really is bullshit. I can’t tell you how many times over the years that market finishes below some average and then all the people on CNBC are saying how bearish that is and then the next day the market goes up 3%
What to do? Sell spy puts at loss &amp; lose purchasing power? Or will it go to $430 before eow

SPY lookin like it's going to drop hard AH. just saying. I back that statement up with absolutely nothing but the tingle in my balls telling me it'll be bears on parade tomorrow morning.
We don’t need jobs. We need stimmy’s.
I agree I got out my 9.50 calls with little profit. Low 7’s I’ll get back to long side
Lol hopefully never. let's short the bitch
Mr. JPow, Bulls r so broke. Please do it now! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
At least you could buy 0dte calls and the buy puts if you saw the trend 😭. SPY on friday was totally un-tradable (or it was just me) throwing money at 0dte calls and the occasional put
You guys having fun? Checked in on SPY's movement today and -- *whoo whee --* I know some of you may now be considering therapy.
That you cath?!
Basically
The chart is asking for it, top it off with macroeconomic factors and it's the most probable course of action.

Morgan Stanley made a comment saying it’s been a good revenue source basically. So I’m betting on a good dip to come along next. Usually what happens based off just news like that.

Why? It rocketed because of a comment Morgan Stanley made. You think that growth will be sustained? Prob not, but I got some pretty cheap $18 puts

What's your main objective here while going cash gang? What are you exactly waiting for and how long till you load up on longs or shorts?
&gt; but they buy new ones and also renew their service every month. 

That helps AAPL much more than T.

Yeah it's predictable revenue -- and T does generate a TON of cash -- but not rapidly growing revenue. And it's very easy to switch to another company once your contract is up.


&gt; And its a service you cant really live without these days.

True, but the same can be said about electric utilities. Right now T offers few of the benefits of utility-like companies and most of the risks.

SPY has to tank $100 for the next 4 trading sessions and he would still be short $40 on coming up on his legendary bet.

This is why I come to /r/wallstreetbets.
Thanks for the breakdown. I feel like the divi is whats been keeping the share price low these years. Also everyone has a phone, but they buy new ones and also renew their service every month. And its a service you cant really live without these days. Although i dont use at&amp;t because they suck🤣 maybe theyll start sucking less. Its a yolo im prepared to get my ass spanked

I’m not playing options on it but I like the company. In for long term. May add more.
This is how the market is going to be from now on. All the easy gains are in the past. If you didn’t make it by now you’re not going to. These are unfortunate truths.

Spy 435
I own T, worst thing I bought in the past year.

First of all they've already announced they'll cut the dividend when they spin DirecTV off.

Secondly, T is a utility. Everyone already has a phone and TV. Competition in both industries is cutthroat (DTV has to compete with NFLX and Comcast and the like) so the only way to grow is to steal market share from someone else.

The Time Warner part has some value but the TV properties are stagnant/dying as well. Movies aren't dead but the post-corona way they will be distributed will obviously be different from the past.

So the reason you own something like T is for the cashflow/dividend/breakup value. Maybe DTV and TW are better off on their own or owned by someone else. Lot of uncertainties for a company that's supposed o have high-certainty profits.
And together they toked.

McDonald’s is offering $16 an hour. When I was a kid it was 7.25. I would have fucking jump on board with that. Hospital staff workers (depending on the levels) are making less than McDonald’s workers and still McDonald’s is having crazy staff shortages. They stay open for like 6-7 hours now.

Plus the chipotle in my area is $15 minimum. Almost all “mindless” jobs now are about 15-17$ now.
Power hour or dump hour
I, too, love geology.

Isn’t it awesome when you hold a stock for a month and all it does is drop and then moons 20% the next day after you sell
This god awful advice. Please don't do this.

Come on run QQQ 365 🤑
Spy about to go green good sign for tomorrow
Banbet
They seemed trustworthy
It’s a juicy yield but maintaining it is by no means a guarantee
Here’s a lesson on spy options: when spy green buy puts, when spy red,  buy calls. So many people here whining about selling their puts during the green rip.

Example; sold my puts just now and bought calls. Weee let’s do it again 

Rest in pieces
I went for brunch and come back to this shithole. What y’all do while I was away?!
Lmfao my SPY puts are dead, cool
Have you seen the charts?
Luv you can’t be serious stop fucking going back up I’m gonna lose my god damn mind
is this a ban bet? i am wondering if you can fit them. I believe you can.
Some decent support between $24 and $25.50ish. Better hope it holds if it drops down there.
Well I bought a spy 438 put just now so y’all are welcome I guess
Zoom out on the 1 W chart and learn TA.
If I were you, I'd get out. There are better opportunities imo.

Woke up this morning and saw my SPY 440 lotto ITM and printing that I picked up at close on Friday, fell back asleep, woke up just now to it worth absolutely nothing. I’m a retard for not selling it and going back to sleep.
I bought puts and SPY is going up... I am cursed!
Even if they are doing it to expand, I don't think you'll see much green unless you buy a LEAP.
CLF saving my whole portfolio.
those who missed SPY puts should have gone SPY calls... like clockwork

Could go on and on, but really it's redundant.  I let the market tell me what works, not you.
let me sell at top, and buy at bottom plzz

Not to late to FOMO into spy/qqq
Seems like memes holding market up today from tanking further
10/15 exp. does it look like I got the glass crystal ball?
Probably just bought some 10/13 441c
Uhhh why?
It's at a low because they cut the dividend and now no one wants that shit

Good luck
Nothing more bullish than -0.25% SPY 2h before close. Bear are fuk.
Alright you autards. Let's go buy that dip! Plenty of fat cash to make.
2017 and 2018 is coming back. Multiple months of down and sideways. Until the last bull left the market they will start with the run.
I was averaged in at .42 and fell asleep i ended up selling it at 1.00 and made 300$. Scared the shit out of me bc its 10/11 and i wouldve had -12,000+ in margin when it gets exercised bc i cant grab a coffee
But has the debt depreciated more to inflation than they stand to lose with a rate increase?
Buy tomorrow after a 5% drop
Wait is a value trap good?? Doesnt sound like it🤣 how low you think shes goin. I dropped 15k and didnt leave any dry powder because i like to be retarded

I don’t know man. You weren’t alive during the 1928 depression. Those years seem pretty awful.
&gt; There is a reason prices move and it's not because of magical star drawings or "support" and "resistance". over 80% of trading is done through algorithms and institutions. Do you genuinely - and I wish you to properly ask yourself, do you   
&gt;  
&gt;honestly  
&gt;  
&gt; believe that they give two fucks about chart patterns or price levels? 

&amp;#x200B;

When surveyed, they said yes.  https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=126024068112004090070125064117102098039053020046074058007069112088085114006090003108037124118022010007121006117112102074097040048054065011084089116092127015036046038120079117088108110066097076124001007019110123106024098067119106013098003098083&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE

&gt;For example, futures fund managers rely heavily on computer-guided technical trading systems (Irwin and Brorsen 1985; Brorsen and Irwin 1987; Billingsley and Chance 1996), and about 30% to 40% of foreign exchange traders around the world believe that technical analysis is the major factor determining exchange rates in the short-run up to six months (e.g., Menkhoff 1997; Cheung and Wong 2000; Cheung, Chinn, and Marsh 2000; Cheung and Chinn 2001).  
  
In contrast to the views of many practitioners, most academics are skeptical about technical analysis. Rather, they tend to believe that markets are informationally efficient and hence all available information is impounded in current prices (Fama 1970). In efficient markets, therefore, any attempts to make profits by exploiting currently available information are futile.  
  
Nevertheless, in recent decades rigorous theoretical explanations for the widespread use of technical analysis have been developed based on noisy rational expectation models (Treynor and Ferguson 1985; Brown and Jennings 1989; Grundy and McNichols 1989; Blume, Easley, and O’Hara 1994), behavioral (or feedback) models (De Long et al. 1990a, 1991; Shleifer and Summers 1990), disequilibrium models (Beja and Goldman 1980), herding models (Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein 1992), agent-based models (Schmidt 2002), and chaos theory (Clyde and Osler 1997).

There's no guarantee the market will crash. And if the float is owned, and no one sells, margins will cause entities to cover at a loss if the market does crash. It will crash with it most likely but after ??? Who knows.. or the billions in hf will keep this game going forever. It's a play. No guarantees.

Probably a sell off into close. 200 day crossed over the 8 on the daily. Big barriers to breach. If tomorrow opens down and that 200 day ends up on top, we are going bigly down. QQQ wants to touch that 200 day and I think we see that this week.

Well I mean it’s pretty obvious it’ll never replace fiat currency, because it isn’t backed by anything and far too volatile to reasonable used as an every day currency. Plus, if the government can’t control it in any aspect then it’s basically out of anyone’s control to stabilize it or tweak it.

First they got my food wrong, then they tried to refuse to give me a refund, then they only gave me a partial refund hoping I wouldn't notice, and now I'm back to get the rest of the refund and they've had a power surge and their registers are down apparently. I used my Robinhood card to pay and clearly the goal is to split up my buying power and make it so I have to wait until the refund goes through before I have the full amount to trade with in the best case or just never get the full amount back in the worst case.

“Make it rain” means throw bills on a stripper. She’s saying she wants to pop that pussy for you.
Could’ve sold later for nicer profit but how greedy can you be to not sell a contract up 280% lol PROFIT IS PROFIT DONT YOU GUYS FORGET IT
King retard doesn’t really have a beef with corn bucks, just that the price is a collection of ungodly leverage &amp; manipulation.

People that think it’s actually an inflation hedge are morons and the dream that it’ll displace fiat currency is especially retarded. If the central banks were actually worried that it might do that, they will squash it in an instant.
u/cashflow_ calls you "little"

What's that about?
It’s time for Spy calls for power hour $440 be nice
It's gotta tank, But big banks with good earnings could trick everyone for a little longer right?

The daily chart on spy lmfao bulls gg
PROG is the play

Haha fuck why is CLOV up 3.3% for me? I hate shorting I want everyone to make money so it sucks to see so much red, if you think it's actually going to go down I'll throw some change at it. Lose more on sports and slots in a night so no care given

You gotta post foot pic now to prove you already don't have the tat

Apple products are garbage. So many cumbersome or unresolved workflow and QoL issues in every product. There’s no one at the helm anymore, and they’re just pumping out products. This is probably peak Apple.

Good news: up 330% on my puts 
Only problem is that I only bought a single option
No kidding. Brutal hold

Volume has been shit for most of the year now, clowns think this has been bullish that stonks go up with practically no one actually buying.

just options hedging by MMs and retards slamming the bid with market orders
Wait, this isn’t where I parked my Ford puts
Aw shit another legdown incoming
Could be worse but that’s why I never talk about it with anyone. Could always be worse unless you’re dead I guess haha. Thanks everyone much love

You dump yours?
Ban Bet Created

**/u/shutupdigit** bet **NTLA** goes to **130.0** in **1 week** **or i’ll get butterfly tattoo on foot and post foot pics**
tsla is because most of tsla's profits (over 70%) come from selling environmental regulatory credits for 100% profit, but a lot of credits supposedly expire soon and haven't been sold yet. idk about the latter.
You dont need 25k to be a day trader.
Tesla? Their leading the EV market and revolutionizing the auto industry to the point every other brand is trying to catch up. Corn doesn’t have value apart from its limit supply and the willingness of people to buy it tho for sure

Read, i’ll see you at the Lambo dealer.
Short CLOV naked. I assure you tits can't go up LOL
Except the case that I mentioned, bulls FOMO’d in whereas one the case you mentioned, there’s nobody still holding from 52 weeks ago. And don’t worry that 75% is going to turn into 60% soon
On 2017 we have 6 months of sideway bear market. Imagine this 6 months during this period. Lol
Alright you win.
I’ve been right the last 6 weeks straight
the old "catch a falling knife" strategy....I'm shocked that hasn't worked
Lol at this shit volume
Why's it gonna fall?
CHWY is down 50% off the high.  Free money.  I keep buying
What the heck - morning Bull, Late morning Bear, evening back to bull? fack off $SPY.

Buying calls.
We can assume that wasn’t nance and that large OI is a hedge.
Even broken clocks are right twice a day
You’re the only one who’s a clown rn that person is not holding that shit down to .06 he’s smarter than a dumbass like you who doesn’t sell before theta
ATH’s everyday here cauz SPY 2030 = $190
Im avg down to 10 and fucking dying to dump it on the next bagholder.
Yep $10 it is.  Been pocketing call premiums when I can.
perfectly fine. I'm just hoping it stays above 6 until Friday so I can have all my shares called away and reap a nice tidy profit on all the CC's i sold.
What’s Burry’s reasoning for shorting Tesla and Shitcorn

I try to do the opposite by buying them after they are down 20% it hasn't worked too well though

WTF happened to SPY?
cashflow thinks he's burry bc a few of his puts printed
Now begins the slow march downwards. Tech is terminal.
Spy bulls going on tilt
This is literally the most retarded dd I’ve ever seen. Quality wsb stuff. You’re basing your calls off of OI? Really? Lol
well if there's one thing ive learned from this market, its that the same play usually works over and over again no matter how many times you do it
Bond rates will fall tomorrow and will lead to a rally in the tech. Watch $AMD closely to rally above 110$.
opex week I might buy calls just to sell tomorrow. not holding anything for Wednesday through Friday.
Obligatory: Hahaa, fuk u bulls

#DAMN LETS GO YOU FUCK
I'm really fighting the urge to buy AMZN 3250 calls
Does TSLA have any hope of going over 800? Seems way too strong.
Will I shit before I piss OR piss before I shit?
Bad buy
Same…I didn’t sell my calls at 98% gain because My limit was set for 100% gain…
How big we talking
I prefer chicken bones to ES Futes 🔮🧙‍♂️
Hope you’re trolling those OI option calls are worth .06 he first saw them purchased over $1 do you really think that person didn’t sell before theta would fuck them

I think through the winter XLE will be a good play. The 2/22 pipeline calls I bought last week are already +10%, and I think they'll continue to go up due to seasonal demand, even if oil and ng prices drop a bit.
bulls, bears, remember: pigs get slaughtered
The poor misguided lost souls buying calls right now.
Good luck with that one chief lmaoooooooo
My puts are all green except one that I sold off because strike was too low
i didn't ask you to feel bad for me

No I just don’t see the reward in a one sided bet. Where I can lose but don’t win

its always hilarious when you see people posting yolos on tickers the day after it went up by like 20%
SQ calls yet or wait?

Hey buddy. Yeah truly unfortunately
You know price action from monochromatic candles can be VERY helpful. I always switch to mono when doing certain TA.
I did. I said I would buy if it fell below $14 and I got greedy and did not stick to my original plan.
Banbet has no reward. If there was money involved in banbet I’d probably do it. I find more satisfaction by shittalking bulls than getting banbetted

Long story. Summarized, if SQ doesn’t recover to 250-270ish in the next couple weeks it might be rope time.
I'm losing money here, yes

But for some reason I've made 2k on a stupid shitty internet coin I have no idea the use of and I just don't know anymore dudes
You should buy farther out options tbh
Not a bad move . Im just wondering if its gonna have another 5% day tm
Imagine holding yet another wsb stock rn
Eat a dick.

Market turned 🌈 mid market
If you see it cross below 436.20, expect some ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Nah done enough research.
Spx is just eaten up all the options on the market. Rich people getting richer. Damn shit system.
Congrats of you bought puts at the top.
gap's down to 435 but i guess it's less stressful to just get out after seeing your put go down 90% at the intraday high. I would prob have done the same
If you held out for $SOFI to go to $12 you got greedy kid.
They still are going to print its not even Friday yet lmaoo
You bull trappin’ sonsabitches
that was painful
SPY 435 reversal just do it already
Yes
SPY should find it’s footing somewhere around 400.
This market is completely hopeless
Clov holding well while spy bleeds. Fuck it, loading up on more 10/15 $10c’s.
Here we go another headfake up then the next leg Down
GBT just keeps a chugging upward.
What do you mean? I have a cash account. If I buy and sell an option contract the same day it counts as a day trade. And now I am banned because I did that too many times. I have to wait till November to day trade again. I've tried to sell my contracts same day but I am not allowed.
Calling it now this is ending -2% minimum
Opex not open
This reminds me of December 2018. I lost a lot of money then too.
Those could print but I’m sticking w shares personally, 4,000 for a swing trade to $20-22
YOU’RE IN THE BULLETS WAY
You are a sad, strange, little man. You have my pity. Farewell.
What?
TSLA shrek dicks every time it crosses below 793 today.
Time to die.
Well it’s about damn time. My E Mini position was 2K in the red for a while there. But I just closed it out +1200.
Well the mechanism that brings stocks down on open is when call volume is high and MMS needs to stay delta neutral so they buy shares. If Put volume is high remaining delta neutral MMS will have sold short and closeting positions would mean buying back. 

Today’s run up could have been delta hedging with an inverse price action to what we have seen before, this would also make sense as the volume of puts has gone up substantially from 30 days ago.
Bear DD. It's raining and snowing outside and that makes me sad. Puts on SPY

Hey, fair enough. I suppose big news and large trading swings is more relevant to WSB than a cult followings hype, no matter how influential or  accurate I their claims may be about the GME play.
I ain't a bear but if you want quick money short big tech for one or 2 days. Already 60% gains on selling AMZN3300C1410 (Oct 14th for Americans) closing now and watching to see if there's a good buy for the incoming dip
This is gonna be a harsh lesson for you bro
Just sold my 10/11 puts fuck it. Still holding 10/15 and 11/19
\#I'M NOT FUCKING LEAVING!
It’s actually down by almost 1.5% (and still counting) relative to the intraday high when bulls FOMO’d in...
Tis true, very strong economic outlook if SPY retraces at least MOSTLY back to March 2020 levels.
Thougts on GME
Let’s see 433 today!
only the bulls

I made $60 with a SPY once. For me there are better ways.
We're red because boomers can't sell their negative yielding bonds to buy overpriced stocks.
I have pretty much accepted that the 50K I threw into month out calls and buying the dip during the evergrande fiasco is basically gone lol
bruh bond market is closed tomorrow is red day
One of us!!! One of us!!! One of us!!! One of us!!!
It's like y'all don't even know what season it is. This is the time of year when things turn from green to red. Every time we have a green morning that turns red, it's a microcosm of nature. So grab a pumpkin spice latte and enjoy.

Markets diving but clov is still green. Small bumps every day this week to $15 is fine too. Clov baby ☘️
Why not? It did before and it’s a supply driven story. Supplies are low and capex is staying low.

Hi, my name is Bill and I have red-green color blindness. Can someone tell me what's going on with the market today?
Hey guys just woke up, how my 440c's doing?
Down less than half a %. I mean I knew bears were poors but if that’s destroyed to you.. that’s a whole different level of broke
PT Monday, Banbet Wed. Moving PT to tomorrow.

Grammer nazis do not get upvotes
**RUG PULL**™️
Getting into some settled IPO’s. $BRLT and $RSKD. Will be more long positions than anything and both have been getting hammered.
I moved it to 436.20, but I changed the color to green.

Covid daily average cases are down 40% in the US since September 1st. Check the Google Covid dashboard
SoFi is dead after cutting their rewards points program again. Officially worst one on the market
Oh so we're having boiled water for dinner, I see...
I woke up and I was like why the fuck are stocks up 10%? Went back to sleep and now stocks are down 🤔🤡
Doesn’t the fact that we can see calculated sell offs prove that the market is pretty much rigged 🤔
Bottom is in boys
Geez based on how my jokes get up/down voted ima say bears have a way better sense of humor.
Absolute hot garbage
I want to short Mara.. so definitely hold cause I’m wrong way more of then than not
[deleted]
No brainer to turn that job down.

I cannot believe the puts I bought at open are green now lmao
FUBO might be the shittiest stock ever
I don't know why i did this but I panic sold my V calls and bought spy puts. Surely this isn't the bottom.
Not even possible lol
Really SPY acting like a pump and dump bitch ugh

Cmon baby, break through 436 and we go dowwwn
Only with a fifth of crack.
"Ah yes, the smell of tanking the afternoon"

&amp;#x200B;

"Nobody knows what it means, but it's provocative! Gets the bears going!"

Bulls really said 442 today 🤡

Then I used profits to be an idiot and bought 2DTE QQQ 350P. 

I just hate money that much.

Tsla puts r fuk
🤡🤡
[deleted]
Rip to the guy who said he had SPY 445 calls this Friday 😹
I think you have a weirdly narrow definition of the word "cult". A collective movement can very easily be a cult. For example, most politicians have a group of dedicated supporters that is called a cult following.

"implications of the GME play" is exactly the problem. People are calling everything an implication for GME while GME is roughly 1 millionth the market cap of the total stock market. 

The fact of the matter is there's not much going on with the company currently, so you can't make a good news post. Its current valuation isn't tied to its fundamentals enough to make a meaningful DD. There hasn't been a big swing since AUG so no gain/loss posts to make right now.
If you run on long term it’s a buying opportunity. But on short term it’s bad to be a bull now
Can someone explain why there are more sellers than buyers of XLE today while oil prices continue to rip higher?
spy bro what are you doing
Holy fk
There is reportedly a decline in COVID cases. Anecdotally, from the week, no one was wearing face masks at AMC for 007 film and no one was wearing face masks at a family wedding.
Uhhh...why are some stonks red now
Can’t believe I’m saying this but $sofi keeping me up today
Ur a clown cuz u didnt buy?
Quick 305% on these SPY puts
So tell me bulls. How does it feel to be completely and utterly destroyed wit your assholes pissing blood 🩸?
Yes, 20 incoming. My call will go brrrrrrrrrr
That a long climb up for2hr 30mins
yea and so what
Loses more than it wins
rising like my wife's boyfriends cock.
Haha did the same. I’d be careful with xle though kinda overbought. Unless the climate energy crisis is actually going to replace covid as the world “big bad”
And just go through it while all the TA nerds cope and seethe
BTW-I sold it. I didn’t buy it. 

Just put it on this morning for fun. If it expires worthless, that’s all that matters. 🍻
AMZN, what a fucking turd.
VIX is a stubborn bitch these days
Baba going to be red by the end of day 😞
You sure know how to pick them
Help does anybody have the number to retard’s anonymous ?
Where's the FED to save the bulls? Oh wait I forgot they're off today lol
This two months has destroyed all my further gains and earnings. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
👉🤡👈
I bought the top!

....calls. I bought calls.
Oh i'm with you. I trade on pure technicals.
Damn burry was right, bull market is officially over
Its opex week…has to make new lows!
Steady as she goes SOFI, keep it up and let's head for $20.
You're a decent mod, I hope you lose your virginity one day
...position lost...recalculating....
[deleted]
Looks an awful lot like another leg down? Idk
I bought 100 of those Calls. They fuk
Now THAT is funny.
Bears talking mad shit.  SPY will close flat.
You’re lucky. I’m getting banned if SPY isn’t at -4 share price.
No matter what I do my account is red everyday
Bulls be like: 
“BuYYy ThE DiP GUyZZZZ, ZoMG SpY Is DowN -.3% FiREsAlE!!1!1!1!1!1!1!”
5 year low randomly today.  I was just looking at this.  No idea what that discovery sale is, but bofa says it's a buy still.
Do we think SOFI can have another big day up tm?
Should've taken that 20% gain on these calls I guess.
Porque?
got killed
[deleted]
Fuck it. I'm done.
no he had 10/11 puts as well
Clov sale with market dip
Well I guess it’s time to double down on calls
I’m already lubed up and ready to dive
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
You said 450 Monday 🤡
🧠
You'll probably tear me apart but it doesnt mean I am wrong... $ATER's resemblance to GME is uncanny - just see for yourself.
Imagine being so frustrated at not understanding TA that you discredit it entirely 🤡😂
Damn If I got PUTS at the peak today id have a 10 bagger!!! I seem to never learn...lol
Nah 450 eoy
Wen TSLA puts?
The market is literally pinned at 4350 and 4400 if you look at OI and the gamma.

So i mean.... yea, your 1SD strangle is way too wide bro.
What is Nancy pelosi buying
Dude… get fucking vaccinated already
This is getting fucking old
Price action.
This is just a bearish market in general after sept ended and we were still red there was no excuses anymore. On top of that nothing but bad news everywhere. Economy, our world southwests news today was really bad for all air travel in general.
Really? Spy just broke below 437... it's just starting to get interesting. Been a boring day so far.
!RemindMe In 2 Days
Is it a perma ban if it doesn’t happen?
oh I’m excited
PRO Gansters shorted 42%😏
Down the drill goes
Now we know why it’s called SPY?
I bet on China today which would have been smart only I picked the one Chinese stock that was dumping. I are not smrt.
Religious exemption
AT&amp;T a buy rn?
Well happy my funds didn't settle today.  Thank you Mr Columbus
Dumb bulls will never learn.
i was wondering why my calls were going up during this drop... turns out, i bought puts by mistake ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I feel like chicken little telling everyone the spy is falling
This shit is taking on water
should get real interesting in the 436-435 zone
I'm not taking a job where I get paid a $400 extra month but the commute is longer and I have to do actual work. Rather make less and stay at my current job where I go to sleep and watch movies on my iPad. 

&amp;#x200B;

SPY 450 10/15
Can't wait to buy some at 180
OH NO BULLS. ARE U NERVOUS? ARE U SCARED? IM SCARED!!!
JFC boys, I might be big fucked this time.
Fucking crash n burn n die
Bulls finally realized stocks don’t magically go up everyday
Mr. Market, you're ruining my kid's future
It’s never too late bulls u/investing
Futures were right for once.
[deleted]
I ain’t no boomer, and I’m a respectable degenerate, my portfolio consists of SPY options 48 hours out max. Depending on which way I piss in the morning dictates a Call or Put day. Bear down today
Nah they didn’t. I would know 😏
I dont like the stock market!
Everyone locked and loaded on their gourd futures?
The Town Crier shouted: "Hear ye, hear ye! Inflation on the rise once more! Used car prices inflecting upward! Lumber inflecting upward! Bond yields on the rise!"

The townspeople, most of whom shared a strange resemblance with a bull, disregarded the crier's warning. They spat on him, laughed at him and did all but give him sincerity. It was only two days later when the inflation data came out that the townspeople realized that they should have listened.

Anyone else make some good $ from SPy 437PUT today ? 😁
Shouldn't these actually pump before the dump? If it just dumps it's called garbage
Why did I buy calls this morning?
Wasn't his position 10/8 puts that didn't hit?  The market paper handed for him.
SPY on its way to discover China now

Bonds are also selling off lol. Who tf knows where the big money will sit. Probably DIA and oil.
Tiny green huge red tiny green huge red fuck me so hard jesus christ.  Can't believe I was actually feeling OK this morning.
Bears panic sold their puts 30 minutes ago
In your opinion, what made market turning from green to red?
WAY DOWN WE GO
Yeah, I transferred in more cash, intending to throw a pile of it at $XLE, then realized fuck, this isn't gonna be in my account until tomorrow.
So Bye bye Mr American SPY.
SPX tested the top of my 0dte 1SD Strangles, now looks like it will test the bottom. 50 point swing. 😂
Damn fucking bulltrap
Inverseption strikes again
What are they looking like
Oh wait this is 19min ago

Epic bull trap. Everyone r fuk.
Vaccine mandate coming at my work - puts on my job.

If your stock is up 3-5% on the day, but your calls are down 10%+. You're being fucked by the Greek Gods. Sorry but they are going to worthless.

What is going on with the $SKLZ and $PTON rumor? I am in both.
I seem to be losing more than I'm winning though
If your calls are hurting with a stock up 3% on the day, it's over. Time to sell.
Well looks like FB isn’t done drilling
What did they do lol
Welp I said it before and ill say it again. Shit in one hand and wish in the other and see which fills up first.

Calls on WSB learning TA
Clov is having a great day. My calls? Not so much. 15 EOW please.
I wanted to go all in at open on LVS on Friday but I didn’t. Missed out on 800% gains. I wanted to do it today and I didn’t. Missed out on 100% gains. What the fuck should I do now.
They're all gonna laugh at you!
Up 30% on MARA shares, do I continue holding or take some profits?

The coin is flying, but you never know what's round the corner. Not sure what to do.
They cut the dividend. Trading view hasn't updated yet.
small dick club, welcome to the dump phase of the pump and dump cycle. Thank you for playing
Watch SPY just end at like +/- 15 cents on the day again today. Lmao would be so annoying
Aren't bears supposed to go into hibernation about now?
Bulls go vanish mode when SPY goes red
I’m not up to date on what ban bet is, please fill me in
People have been saying puts for the past 2 weeks and its been trading sideways

I agree. I wouldn’t work for an irresponsible company like that anyway. These class action lawsuits in the future could bankrupt them. There’s a reason the vaccine manufacturers have immunity, they know what’s coming.
As if bonds yielding 1.5% is a better place to park your money. Stupid boomers
If it goes down to $46.50 I’ll send you money for a beautiful steak dinner for you, your wife and her bf

This looks like finding a bottom before a green rocket into the holidays to me.
VZ and T getting clapped
Duh
Bruh they're in here every night talking shit and during the day its just silence as soon as we start dropping
I checked the chart before i grabbed puts. Its on a steady down trend since june and bounced up above the 90 ma before the news broke so lets see
NFLX puts are the move for earnings 🤑🤑🤑

Spy at 437.50 resistance. Third time in 3 days. Bounce or plow through?
I was talking about SOFI before it was cool
Everyone has to start somewhere &amp; if you are consistent taking those small gains eventually you won’t have to worry about spending a day trade
Oh yeah man.. PLENTY of places to hide in middle management.
lets rekt the few left over bulls
sir, i am on the opposite end of this trade and i can't allow that to happen. I want to actually eat dinner tonight
Thanks, brometheus. It expired last week, but I see your point.

What calls or puts you guys setting up for gains tomorrow

You’re comparing a clothing that is worn over your body to something that is injected inside your body. You can’t undo something like that. I’m surprised these companies lawyers are even allowing them to follow this, imagine all the lawsuits coming when people die from heart issues of this vaccine. The vaccine manufacturers aren’t liable but the companies will be. Interesting times coming.
Mans sees the future like heimdallr
The market will end flat again. Just wanted to tease everyone
Move to cash account. Daytrade all you want
Went on an ambien induced Mel Gibson type rant last night and had to apologize for several slurs this morning. Bullish.

🤣😂
today’s so damn easy 

calls on the way up and puts coming down

a lot of people complain but all this volatility is nice
does anyone use tech anymore? guess its all oil and coal these days 🤡
Is this time to go back up now?
if aapl and msft drops, maybe we sliding more
Guess I pressed the wrong buttons today
Think you might have called your puts abit too early
AMZN is selling their stock on amazon.com
hedging with vxx is just a bad time.
SPY is made up of around 520 companies currently. If you want it to go up you just gotta pump the underlying companies. Probably start with the one's over a Trillion dollar cap since they have the biggest effect. 

You'd be amazed what a few Billion can do to pump your bagz.
I’ll be uploading gain porn by Wednesday lmao
no one ever went broke taking profit 😌
That's too easy bro it's a trap
That’s sad and why 99% of people in here will lose in this market. They’re all dip buying. Works until it doesn’t.
Bears will win for the rest of the year.
FB go ahead and rip now you Charmin soft bitch ass
Looks to me like SPY got it's +1/2% for today, and is now going for it's -1%.
was I judas in the past life or some shit. there is no reason im this unlucky
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
I think SOFI finally has some tailwinds and a bid under it
Better than no profits or losing money
Yes luv go back down you pos
How ?!
I've got this red line drawn at 437.21 that it refuses to cross. Should I move it?
If it is worth bragging about via text or online, it is worth selling and taking the profits.

I see Jamie Dimon is selling his shares today.
They slept in... isn't that enough
Yeah for sure, fuck a diversified portfolio we all wanna be rich now!!
That’s what I’m counting on, but I’m cutting it pretty close on my put credit spreads. I’ve got some at 3200, 3250, 3300 and unfortunately 3350 that expire next week…
nobody cares about technicals.
I looked at signing up for that shit…it’s expensive!

Hey Siri what’s a macro trend
Trying to convince myself that $50-100 profits are okay spending a day trade on. I’m not rich but it’s honest work
You lose some and you lose some.

can anybody confirm is AMZN still selling stuff
Oof I hope you sold them calls when you had the chance 🤣
Market got bulls and bears fighting over each other meanwhile they fucking both our wives and stealing our kids.
Somebody better give drill team six a day off with pay here. They were not supposed to show up
JPOW PLEASE PUMP IT
they may be, but you don't switch from fuckin high growth, high risk tech to treasuries. blue chips, banks, commodities to treasuries, maybe.
Stop selling clov like a poor

It wont be the top
Its about fucking time man they were getting too cocky in here
i can fucking jump through these gaped assholes today, sorry guys!
I think my stupid decisions might over weigh my smart ones this week.
Selling SPY 450 calls is free money.
Sigh... disappointing stock
How low will sdc go?
Cuz its just some schizophrenic psycho buying for 2 days then all those same people who bought sell for a loss
fubo never holds these types of gains, puts.
they arent forcing anyone to do anything. they simply have conditions of employment. the pilots arent entitled to their jobs. thats like getting mad you have to wear steel toe boots on a construction site.

Dang I'm glad I dint buy calls this morning sheesh. Mostly cause I can't day trade but if you sold calls at the top and bought bottom this morning could of easily got 50-100%. Then flip that shit for another 100 sigh. The woes of not be allowed to day trade.
BEARS RETURN WHILE BULLS BURN

SPY is drunk as fuck, slurring it’s words and knocking over lamps and side tables and shit
QQQ right at that 8 EMA. Close under would be really nice. We about to slide 🎢

Holy red dildo, now we talking
Die bull die
It has to pump before it dumps
SPY, hit 436.20 already, so you can wake up.
Yes sir 8.10 now watch when 7.90 comes going to have quick move to 7.50
My untested hypothesis: bank holiday
A collective movement doesn’t mean a cult. Everyone constantly reminds each other to DYOR and that we are not some cult with dates, regulations, or penalties if you leave. Do you even know what a cult is? People are excited by the implications of the GME play there’s nothing wrong with that.
They’ll just wait until earnings when FCF and guidance are lowered, huh? I believe those people are called “bag holders”.
this volume looks like big money loading up for a trade post news, news might come out this week
Go ahead SDC, bottom out baby
If you can't effort 25k then u don't deserve to trade. Smh
WTF is this limp dick 0.1% dip SPY? I can't buy more calls in the fuckin high 430s, do you think I'm stupid?
Wtf is wrong with spy. Kangaroo market
Big fat thick ass red dildo on spy. So crazy.

CLF baybeeeee
I think this stock will be 75 a year from now easily
...and bulls die.
Hi everyone, I have some S&amp;P 500 ETFs and Nasdaq Inc stocks, but I am making much faster returns on the Nasdaq Inc stocks (they went up 60% in the last year) and for S&amp;P 500 its like 28 - 30%. 

So, do I sell all my S&amp;P 500 ETFs and just dump it all into Nasdaq Inc?
CNBC literally has a guy on named Allan Boomer lmao you cannot make this shit up
Drill baby!
TLRY has no bottom. If I would have inversed myself I could have probably retired this year.
QQQ in the red and VIX creepin. You love to see it.

I’ll see you at $450 by Wednesday
If qqq could follow spy that would be lovely

Just saw a bull eating it’s own shit Lol
Ya I’ve never seen anything like this before there are so many contacts at every date that the price makes no sense compared to other contracts. Also really weird what happened to HOOD after hours on Friday
Ok SPY, haha good joke. You really got us good, go back up now

Capitalism is about the free market not giving employers the right to decide what you do with your body. Would you encourage companies to force women to have abortions because it conflicts with their work? I wouldn’t think so.
OPEC can. Someone will break first because they'll see $$$$$, which will cause the others to underbid. Once they're done jerking off, the cycle will start again at a higher base.
Yeah it’s a joke set up to fuck all of us little guys.
bullish. people aren't rotating out of chadsdaq for a 1.7% yield when inflation is well over 4%.
Sofi you beautiful bastard!
Spin the roulette
Because its turned into some weird cult. GME people, especially those over at r/ss, have turned into New World Order style nutjobs who think everything is intentional and about GME.
It’s like squid games near my house.  Bunch of POS 2wd cars trying to make it up a snowy mountain pass

Spy going down the drain
Basis? Idk but I bought calls and sold them for 100% return .
Spy dying is fucking up all my meme plays.  Or are they just garbage, can't tell
Gues it was a head and shoulders and not a double bottom
Spy just give another leg down and i'm out i promise
If it didn't break 441 today especially without the banks fucking with it, it just killed one day of your odds

Don’t worry that’ll soon change

QQQ $362P 10/15 were a good grab today 👏
Bulls r getting them cheeks clapped
I did exact same. Puts at 440
[deleted]
And it's gone....
Commodities don't play like that, though. You're going to see huge runs, and then 40-50% corrections and a lot of chop before the next breakout. Overall more positive than negative, but the swings are wild.

We're getting cost-push inflation. Demand-pull hasn't really hit yet.
Get ready for negative share price
When do we hear about their Covid treatment? I have 11/19 calls
Yes it CAN happen, that doesn’t mean it will
He's just trying to double down on his odds of his 450c actually surviving on Friday because Pelosi bought so many calls for that day
Dude, just stop. Nobody here buys your star chart readings or your made-up price levels. There is literally not one piece of scientifically peer-reviewed, statistically significant research that concludes any existence of predictive capability within chart patterns or price levels. If the bears gain control of the market, it's because institutions believe we are headed towards a period of lesser economic growth as a result of negative catalysts such as inflation and the supply chain shortage. 

Use your fucking brain, man. The efficient market hypothesis, believed to be true by the majority of smart investors and institutions, states that the market prices in every bit of currently available information. There is a reason prices move and it's not because of magical star drawings or "support" and "resistance". over 80% of trading is done through algorithms and institutions. Do you genuinely - and I wish you to properly ask yourself, do you *honestly* believe that they give two fucks about chart patterns or price levels? You'll get laughed out of the room at any quantitative trading firm if you even mention the words support and resistance.
Drills everywhere.

I consistantly made money ever day since last week. And today I bought spy puts when it was at 440. I will sell it for a big profit if it increases to 438.40 level. Until then I'm going for 200% profit.
Today got real fucky real fast

If it still has more time beyond dec 31st and you’re still holding, that shit goes on next years taxes. You have to sell and realize the loss to be harvested.
SOFI tons of temporary resistance at 18.5, gotta break through that to fly again.
Lol wut
This divergence on oil stocks from WTI/Brent is a great buying opportunity. Picked up some 10/15 XOM $62c
Anytime while I have puts would be great
This is debatable. Advertisers are starting to realize that their dollar doesn’t go so far on Facebook. And ya gotta factor in the younger generations rejecting it while it’s generally older user base dies off (from the COVID their misinformation is spreading). Short term, it may get back there, but long term, Fuck that zuck.
Option pricing on $HOOD is broken half the CSP’s are green and half are red today I should be up at least $200 today but I’m even
Same
That not even a crush
Triple bottom $437, I’d be buying as many calls as you can
He crapped all over MRNA on Thursday -- given his track record, MRNA is simply refueling on the moon on its quest for Pluto.
this clov iv crush is brutal. my calls for next week are down 10%
This comment is aging poorly D:
Last earnings they rallied the week of it then fucking sold off like hell
Energy stocks should be double where they are right now. They've already priced in "transitory," as if demand is guaranteed to come crashing down. Basically the same idea for all commodities. An all or nothing bet that everything will play out like lumber.
It's 0.30 green dude settle down lol
Let the de-clovering begin
Neither were puts.  Up 2% but trying to sell them bc it’s too risky to hold
By My count about 2 million in CLOV Yolo alone in last couple trading days. Lots of faith in CLOV !
Lmao
Where’s your source Pelosi has those calls?
4/5 doctors say you will be reborn as a cockroach if you own spy puts

Wish I had unlimited day trades like all these big whale fuckers have.

Prog is on fire today! It just keeps going up.
Then buy puts and good luck to you
we fly high, SOFI
Lool I just did that. Not a good look. But I’m still holding
Clov about time selling down now grabbed 7.50 puts .07 should get a double by tomorrow
I have an open order to sell my puts

AMZN is hell bent on killing me. They’ve got earnings in less than 3 weeks, they should be fucking soaring.
Alright just got out of my 11:00 meeting let’s check on SPY WHAT THE FUCK
GME staying above 180$ got me rock hard
Kinda like my day .. starts off great and goes downhill from there
Can we stop pretending like FB stock isn't destined to go back to ATH? Everyone "hates" it and thinks it's a cancer, but they're all addicted to it and will continue using it. Thus FB will continue to be the king of advertising spend.
I predict a RIOT
Actually you know what, let it happen

Tax wise, I still get the deduction if a call expires to nothing, right? Or do I have to sell that shit to be an official loss?
anti capitalist bastards
🤭
Nasdaq to 16,400
You’re misreading the macro case. Most people are and the price is reflective. You’ll see what happens come November.
No 👺
SPY teetering on the brink of going red. Hold on to your cums, bears. You don't want premie ejacs.
Yup
You don’t have to make excuses to not do it
I'm not sure. I would have just kept cracking and racking the $80/week if I were him
FB calls were not the get rich move I thought they would be today
Not with the EOD Friday type volume. Big fish buying in
The uptrend is long gone and a new downtrend is establishing itself. A lot of people in denial. I just hope we take a quick dive so we can avoid chopping between 400-440 for the next year

You love to see it. Keep buying calls retards. Maybe you'll get your head out of your ass one day
I mean if you’ve been working a job for 20+ years it’s pretty comfy and easy to stay where you are. They’re fighting for their right to not have something forcefully injected into their body.

So we should have no worries about drill team six today, because they get Columbus Day off
👀 they done let the fd puts through the doe 👀🦘
Fellas SPY can't break out of the 440's which means we go back down to 420's before ATH. Save your money on calls
What some hot earning stocks this week?
S&amp;p 4300 wen?
Lmao, no where near, the price differential between the two is nowhere near that of a toyota and ferrari. Additionally, Invisalign is the far superior product in every way for slightly higher cost. Plus, factor in the demographic that would get something like this and they more than likely have dental insurance that will pay $1000-$2000 of it off right off the rip, can’t do that with a ferrari.
OK.  somebody gave drill team six Columbus day off today, right?
This market is too fucking easy: spy 10/15 450c

Absolutely, but I've been watching this ticker every day for the past 9 months. It's become fairly routine to anticipate movements.

Breaking: Alex Karp says PLTR should be valued at $17 before October 17th. After that it is okay to go back to normal.
Are you profiting overall?
SOFI price target 25, currently pushing for 19 soooo much room to run 🔥

Try doing child level DD on a calendar before you trade
Can I come back out yet?  
-SPY 🌈🐻
and is superior
Bought some extremely cheap stupid otm calls for Sofi but those are the ones that make you the most money if they are actually hit so let’s go Sofi I guess fuck the rest of the market
so you need about 10mm minimum
I think mods offered flair to the ones without flairs?

This pump looks low volume across tickers
Imagine not having $TWNK
SoFi moving up so fast… I love it…
Crazy cope
Keep it and buy puts on the tickers. It's a great indicator for bearish plays.
wait the casino is open today???
Looking at this SPY chart, is it only me seeing it's in fucking shambles? It's holding for dear life just above $438, and if we break it you know we're heading back to $437.

This is just about to break that floor.
TSX is closed today but my portfolio is still up 3% thanks to my ‘Murican stocks. GOD BLESS AMERICA! Leftover turkey never tasted better 🦃

4 of the past 5 times I've gone to this Wendy's, I've had to get a refund. At this point it's making me lol at the fuckin retard owner not being able to figure out how to hire people or the fuckin retard customers giving the place so much money and letting them get away with never getting the food right that my 4 orders aren't making a difference
Fuck Roku and Facebook
If you bought them 20 minutes ago good and sell.
Trailing stops hit on my 0DTE 439Ps. Don't even care, profit is profit on weird days(months) like this.
Still waiting for answer!.

National Online Bank Day? That’s a thing?

When is National SPY Goes Up 5% Day? Could use that one right now.
Fun fact: historically the market actually tends to perform better on low volume days.
Beans up $.10 one day, down $.10 the next.
maybe trim a little but don’t sell all, there’s no resistance till the high 19’s
Going cash this week.  I don’t have the time to watch the options go up and down 20 percent through the day

Buy spy puts at 11am every morning and sell it an hour later before the bounce off support.
Meme stocks have been in the morgue as of late. No need for them currently.
KMI calls. Low IV, 2023 leaps for $20 still cheap.
Back down
Will always have a special place in my heart for PLUG. Started accumulating at $7 and held. That was the smoothest 10x and smoothest exit I'd ever had.
Oh cool, QQQ going to keep the market upright

I’m gonna need IV to shoot waaaaay up
Y’all were busy loading up TLRY and not focusing on the actual squeeze : OCGN
So how did I miss Ryan Reynolds buying a cellular provider ?
Had an absolutely horrid experience involving multiple phone calls over several days with Chewy over prescription cat food because they claimed at first that I'm ordering the wrong food (this was a subscription order they had been sending for 4 years, every month), then they claimed my prescription was out of date. My cat was gonna have another blockage and fucking die without this food. And they were absolutely worthless. Banefield at Petsmart filled my order just fine on the "out of date" prescription. I hope CHWY stock go to $0
SOFI bulls, ya’ll want anything from gucci? Dm me with your sizes

Anyone remember MUD's frim the mid to late 90's?  This thread kinda feels like that
Spy went from 438 to 453 in 3 days back in August (August 19th 438) (August 20th 446) (August 21st 453) then back to retracemnt. And I peeped that on the 3 month chart
Did the Judge just say that Cramer bought 75????   shares of Wynn?  Cramer can't even buy a round lot for his charity?
OCGN actually has a shitload of runway. Get on board before real take off
If you invested $100,000 in BABA same this day in the last year now your investment will worth $50,000

Isn’t Evergrande loans due today?
Puts on TWNK. She must come down!
so you willing bought the top? or are you a bad trader
lol my 10/15 GME $260C just went +75% today. Well I don't mind.

Note to self bois, whenever you see volume dry up like that with GME, buy calls 1-2 weeks ahead and enjoy profit.
Which breakout?

Depends if you think it’s really going to hold up. No other meme stock has done besides GME or AMC. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
What’s your basis?
this one held a little longer. Thought we might have something to be excited for just for a minute there. Glad I wasn't a buyer today on anything.

You guys think SPX reals in another 10 points today?
I’m mean I guess that makes sense, but aren’t they mainly a Canadian company, although the biggest in the industry
I’m playing miners. Once the gold price starts moving, these will take off. I’d look for some liquid and high dividend paying companies. I wouldn’t be playing the 3x leverages ETFs. Those deflate way too much.
Those are rare and beautiful words
Just bought some SOFI, the dip is coming
Lmao I’ll be uploading 15K+ gain porn
Good luck haha
FCEL sucks. Hydrogen fuel cells are way behind any other renewable options. Not worth the investment in developing them further.
Ahhh now I see why I failed social studies
Good question. There's probably a database somewhere that breaks down average volume by day but I'm not sure where that would be.
I fell for it with SDC, didn't I?
it aint going there in 2 months, pal
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the baggies' way.

Hahah hello, I knew one of you would comment, although very unlikely it would be anyone in here. Obscure biotech stock that I’ve never seen mentioned in here.
Ten different positions in my account and they're all green. Just a +0.48% day, though. Aesthetically pleasing but awfully dull.
Damn if the banks start selling off we are truly fucked.

Idc if $WISH is trash. Here is a buy imo.
It's getting spooky in the market rn but I'm not folding iv been here before. This shit ain't fazing me. Spy 450 10/15

Then I’m retiring
I think volume is down because it’s a semi holiday
It’s bank holiday. Volume will be shit.
Trimmed some positions and have $3700 to reinvest.  What do?
Most people forgot the market was open today. Like me. I’m most people.
DKNG run up pre sb is the move
OCGN - maybe I should trade hungover more often.

With the absolute state Battlefield 2042 will be in if they keep their current release schedule and the fact EAs stock has been crab walking for the last 12 months, I'm going to short EA if they don't delay the game until next year.
It'll happen late, or AH, dump premarket, and climb back up again.
Slept in and woke up seeing a couple red candles slightly larger than the other candles. Decided to buy 10k in PUTs. That’s my level of DD
Buy puts at a discount. (Ps. Fuk your puts).

Hi
Looks at it as a tax deduction
trimming your position for profits is never a bad idea
gladly appreciated
Question for smarter people: 

Is the average volume for SPY heavily weighted by mid-and end-of-week trading? Cause the volume today is shit.
It’ll go to 441 for about two minutes in some grand circle jerk.
Haha yeah
MM's are the real retards if they think anyone is falling for their obvious fucking traps. Fuck off
Got in at the right time
Really depressing to be right about corn ripping two weeks ago, but choosing the wrong miner. Went with HUT over MARA and it’s a $70k difference ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
This wants to dump so hard and I'll be there holding these calls when it does. I Just know it.
If spy goes red we may plummet. Gap filled to 4400, may gap fill down

Too slow for my 0DTE to recoup value

I wish I could send a message to the cheap bastard throwing 1/10th of fair price bids on my low volume calls.
Earnings didn’t even cause a pop, the charts look like shit, dunno what catalyst is going to get this thing moving other direction
THETA GANG FUCKIN YO BITCH
SPY really going to walk back up to 440.25 for the rest of the day.
Unrealised loss : 1.6k, realised gain: 0.12
I also bought more 🥺
Na for clov
it’s okay to fail. everyone here has failed at trading. you just have to learn from your mistakes
*One simple life hack they don't want you to know!*
No I am holding them, bought more
Do I sell all of my Sofi or just take today’s profits? 🤔

All.these DD better have banbets now
So yeah I had these 438P for today, wanna know what I did earlier today? Fucking quadrupled down at $440 because fuck this market. Also got me some of those $440P so let's see how we'll end up the day.

Fuck this shit and fuck y'all.

Fuck.

I like SHUT
Been waiting 3 months for this breakout

Finally
What have you been up to
Would the bank charter not be priced in ? Or at least this move today probably does ?

Holy shit SoFi!!! Up 35k today!!!

I forgot what it feels like to make money
Been had em
I stupidly sold most of my soft calls when it was up 5%. And now they’ve more than doubled
Gonna hold that SoFi. Fintech in the making
So there is still hope for these 10/15 $450C... lol
I dont want to buy on green days 🥺

Can you change your goddamn picture

FB is very pinned under 330. Quite g word.
Most of the TLRY puts expire 10/15, and so many 10/22 calls have been purchased. Hold until next week and blast off 🚀
GOEV casually up 5%
Just need to time the T-Mobile bottom
No rational person would have that many deep OTM calls exp Friday without knowing something on the general market.

"the fed will fight inflation with rates" is why gold isn't mooning.

Outside of meme stocks, the rest of the year should be smooth sailing for ETFS 

Politics are back to usual, and sure some companies are experiencing issues like southwest, and most growth and other reports are far off from prior years. 

So if you bought the high no need to fear
also buy sofi apes pump my calls ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Naturally SOFi starts pumping again as soon as I sell some CCs

What makes you think it can do it again in this shit market?
Why
Yeah just you, the stimmys I imagine are like 1% of what the governments printed out of thin air in the last 3 years

Edit: probably closer to 10%

What happened next was that market went on a furious rally rest of the year and like an asshole that I am, my 401k missed out on entire year's worth of gains
SOFI is running today. Hopefully that means bank charter approval is soon
Get out while you are ahead

Sofi pinning
I can’t afford that 😝
Mr. Elliott, is it 1,2, down or was it 1,2,3, down?
Shout out to potato eaters! We wouldn't need potato farmers if nobody was eating them.
sounds healthy
I’m bearish equities and bullish gold for the next few months. Once the fed decision to taper isn’t what people think it’s gonna be and stagflation fears set in, all these gold future short sellers are gonna feel some real pain. Remember Gold is traded around the world. Inflation is running hot in many countries.
Well this day has been full of disappointment
not sure what y'all are complaining about, my SOFI, PLTR, OPEN, COIN are 🌝. To infinity and BYND.

Prog goes up 30%. Prog goes down 30%. Prog goes up 40%. Prog goes down 40%.
You know you're a degenerate gambler when the only day you don't lose money is when all your funds are in the "cash sweep".
Does $GOEV have potential for a small squeeze jump?
HOOD should shoot up. COIN is up nearly 6%. All coins are up big. HOOD should 10000% follow this trend
Me too because I'm bored
Yea that’s insane though. I’m betting on a bigger drop after Fed decisions 11/3.

Don't forget that some people said that SDC broke the 7$ resistance and it was going to the moon ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Already sick of Droptober and Lossvember isn't looking good either. 🤮
Priced in. Would be below $435 rn.
It's a group of bears that eat each others children.
Spy leaps it is 😎
We need to host a pep rally for SPY or something. We'll need a Jock Jams cd, a t shirt cannon, and the sluttiest cheerleaders 45 dollars can buy. Maybe get one of those fur suit weirdos to do back flips, I dunno, I'm open to ideas.
Prisoner's Dilemma
SDC lol. You guys really thought
any guesses for spy? I've been trading spy options exp today. Went down -3k on the day to currently up +2k. At my peak I was up 4k today...
EOW
Bull Flag on FB, I think, I don't do TA but anyhow it's about to break out of a wedge and rocket to $343 because my magic 8 ball random number generator told me so.
i would be willing to sell pics of my feet for significantly less than that. Hit me up for savings.
Serious answer or joke answer?
Holy shit bear market
I’ve got a feeling micheal beary might be right again this time ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
They are and your going to get fucked for not calling it
So tired of everything drilling.  Might cash out
spy is going back up 🙂
Yeah....., no.
Aight hear me out…. CLOV FTW!!!!
If god tells Cathie Wood what to trade, why does she make shit plays?
It does on an ETF
If the market closes at 438 I wasted my time
Pure technicals. Nothing else exists except on FOMC days.
some bitch named Sativa earned millions of dollars selling pictures of her feet on OnlyFans so put that in your Jobs Report and smoke it
CLNE
Sure, some did. I made like 45K on GOOGL last quarter on their run-up. A couple grand on FB, too (before all the scandals, of course). Haven't touched AMZN since last year, though.
I'm giving up on $INDI. Should I sell my OCT 15 12.5 calls and recoup ?
Thanks! I’ll check it out
Overslept and sold my dkng calls i bought on friday for +50%
It’s really sad to watch. Then they complain about it not mooning because of manipulation when they don’t understand it’s a trash stock and has 0 reason to go up other than mass buying. The day that it popped 15% it had 2x volume
Forgot it’s not a holiday in America and markets are open.
I tried to make one and the bot wouldn’t accept it. I wanted -10% on the QQQ in 30 days and my ban to be 2 months long.
Just a pre-lunch dip
I’ve tried that method before and it doesn’t really work lol
40 cents more SPY please and thank you
to get back to reality
When’s his expiration?
Straddle moment
Nah 450 isn't a meme we got a bagger set for the 15th. Get with the bulls or get fucked.
Glad I dumped out of SQ first thing this morning
Yea you are a fool if you think they are paying that shit.
I bought at 10.4 so I think Im still fine
Guys, what's happening? 

Why am i losing money?
ARKK y u no crash?
Dude that’s worth a stacked portfolio. Keep your head up (ps. If you think your girlfriend is your forever be careful, had a friend or two lose the girlfriend to the other team!)
And to think I got a 3 day ban for mentioning ROOT 3 times in one day about 6 weeks ago
death, taxes, portfolip pump and dumped in the worst market ever
Tomorrow gone be -1%? That'd be swell for me sir
Spilled Baconator grease all over my khakis at lunch. Puts on my life
Too funny, The Market dropped 130 pts right after I posted this.......
Back to red while vix drops to 17
risking $10k to make $100 lmao
Still buying Ford puts cause I have a low IQ
Invading the Soviet Union did Hitler in more than anything else. Despite a rocky start, the Soviets' vast resources would've always outlasted and overwhelmed the Nazis.
For some reason I read this in an Indian scammers voice
Sq you slut. I blame Cathie for this shit.
100,000 OI on spy 450c expiring Friday  interesting ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)
I know you retards love losing money over here, but 🐸 $PROG 🐸 is the pay today.
SPY has spent the last 40 days floundering around under ATHs. Either we're in for a really painful market for the rest of the year, or we're gonna have some random 1 hour green candle that wipes out every put that's ever been purchased.
So did spy reverse for any actual reason?
This axeman guy and shilling 450 is getting old 🥱🥱
So do we get the ban bet updates at 4?
One man's exhaustion is another man's exhilaration, I guess.
I mean being wrong about something isn’t a reason to get banned. I think he really believes his thesis. It just happens to be dumb and wrong lmao
Has Spy just been punched in the face by the Gypsy King?
Let's fucming go AXE! Bullish gang all the way
SPY puts 10/15 $420-$415 OI= 254,820

SPY calls 10/15 $450-$455 OI= 414,936

Very very soon.
Took profits on 439p I’m out for the day, gl y’all
The judge is feeling bullish
Bulls already starting to act like sadbois in the  chat
How many pumps from the infra bill can we actually get?

CPI data and FOMC minutes on Wednesday. 🩸
Where do you see that(
Fb either die or moon, stop this sideways bs
BABA, NIO, CHGG
Anyone know when the next SPCE flight is expected to launch? I'm to lazy to look it up
Fair enough. It would depend on the actual company, and exposure to the headwinds, plus fundamentals, and (I hate to say this) but technicals. Some might rebound way better than the more debt-laden, overvalued P/E and P/S tech names. FB is an exception, and is fucked, though.  


But a fair number of tech names who do almost everything digitally shouldn't be affected by things like logistics &amp; shipping, and physical product supply. ADBE, GOOGL, and CRM come to mind.
VIX isn't convinced.
Earnings always strangle for me. 4dte 50p-60c
MMs I have never seen people so savage in my life 😂😂 if this ends up big red this will be one of the funniest things I’ve seen this whole year
Lfg!!!!! Hell yea
He’s going to start trolling to cover up this whole 450 thing and say he was joking. They should ban him for posting his DD and “open OI” arguments. I don’t know why he wanted to drag other people into lose money.
bought spy calls
Infrastructure bill will cause us a nice bump up but when is it getting approved is the problem .

Just because it's not a "sHOrrT SqueEzE" doesn't mean it's a dead company
SDC is being quite snailish today 🐌

SPY bb what is u doin
Will GME \*choose\* to save the market?
Fucking garbage T
Retards being lead to the slaughter
Last earnings report really sunk them. They claim it was supply chain issues that mostly contributed to the less than stellar revenue. We’ll see what happens
usually flat with tech rises, but down on dumps lol. i’m not complaining with a 10% day tho right now don’t get me wrong
They'll be fine tomorrow.
Spy going down harder than Deontay Wilder
Where do u think this is going!?

Fucked around on an SDC option for the first time. Lost 20% of it's value already. Am I doing it right?
bulltards deserve to get clapped. it is opex week after all.
I’d say you have a decent chance, good luck
Bro we about to go red
dead company
It's pronounced Adidas.
Said it last week and bought calls. Was a day too early. Never fails
i can't believe the 1-year chart is red

From the brinks of Marvin call to having purchasing power again. All in the space of 3 hours
I almost shorted there. Instead I shorted at 4370 and I’m thousands of dollars in the red. Don’t be like me.
We will no worries it's time to get rich
Wrong way SPY.
there is far better squeeze stocks out there if thats your cup of tea
lmao no fucking way we hit new ATH this week
Top trending since midnight: CLOV, BABA, SDC, GME, TSLA, LUV, AMC, SOFI, PLTR, TLRY. Choose your destiny!
An entry around 236 seems like the bottom to me
Bought spy calls right before the dump 🤡
Bye bye money I never liked you anyway
$15 to watch kids play hockey, he got ripped off
Don't confuse luck with skill
You still can, premiums havent moved in line with the underlying yet
No just a traitor
I already shared it yesterday. LUV 5 10/15 51p first thing. They hit 178% at some point. Wish I could have bought them, but such is life when your wife has to submit for compliance prior to purchasing securities.
It’s pretty insane that he still think he’s gonna make money off of them, lmao. I wonder what % of his account it is? Maybe he’s just in denial because he can’t accept that he’s gonna get wiped out
Sorry I meant $25
459 eow cut the bullshit qe the v gang
What’s the other side of that coin
Umm that was me. I’ve been playing it both ways you simp lol
I’m close to pulling the trigger
What did you fkers just do to the s&amp;p 500?!
You better pray we hold up today, otherwise we are testing low* 430’s again.
I’m glad my 401k is there to hedge against me being  an actual retard
Jacked to the fucking tits in NIO calls hope daddy xi jinpeng hooks me up
Well fuck if baba doesnt hit 180 on or before friday im offically out and have to go back to jerkin my gerkin for ramen and probably be out til next year. Was fun while it lasted.
Should. It’s so fukin beat up. Lotsa overhead supply, but all those people know it could hit 250 by Nov. I got in @ 140 &amp; have a strangle from about a month ago that’s finally paying. If I can get an IV crush, will be worthless after all the pain. 🍻

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE
What is the hot dump
mining stocks are fun but god it’s so annoying that they get taken down by two separate markets
At what?  Certainly not arch support.
Last year if Cathie bought any stock, it would automatically pump 10%. This year if she buys something, it just dumps.
Yeah, puts were obvious

4400 is their number to hold it at
3 days of hard rejections above the 50 day ema. Only reason SPY is green right now is that the bond market is closed.  

This is totally bullish guys. Buy calls. 🤡
By 2 weeks out stop fucming yourself with less time

Yes unfortunately, must be bc gme spike
By definition, it’s not a bear market until Tech hits below 13000 and SPY hits below 370
WHAAAA
Wish low of day Clov will follow into red just too many bags . The pumps getting smaller also
GME kinda spring loaded. I always doubt that ticker but chart looking like a breakout.

Where’s SPY 450 by noon guy? And what’s his excuse this time? 🤣
Gonna bust a huge nut when it hits $20 this week
Lmfaoooooooo
Yea that's true, I meant more so the diamond handers that are waiting for it to moon any day now
Solar only pumps or dumps no in between
444 by tomorrow then, ok??
Sad I sold my CLOV last week. Glad I reinvested into 🐸. Will FOMO back into CLOV soon
Depends on how high up you throw them from.
You missing the upward ride
Puts on Hood ? As it getting locked up on Wednesday
DNA is dead. Sell sell sell.
I bet you a margin call, SOFI hits $22 and then drops to 13 buy the end of next week

Yassssssss lets see 9$

I bought calls bitch
Guarantee tomorrow is a 2% day these fucking market makers just wanna burn premium right now
One month chart for AMC is looking pretty good.
Nothing wrong with riding the pumps, as long as you don't get to loyal to a stock and hold when it's clear it's dropping again.
SPY on track to go under 430 again this week…
High yield savings is the safest. You’ll lose 2% on inflation but putting it in market you are taking the risk of losing 30%.  Could also make 30% so depends on your own risk tolerance I guess.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
SOFI $18! I came!
If you aren't playing both sides of this you're not very good at trading.
because Stone Cold Said so it will
Lol this place is so hype when there's green on the board
CLOV up a measly 4% what am I missing
SPY has been annoying these last weeks more than anything else. Up down up down down down down up up down down up. Just pick a way and go please, or we’re *getting a new SPY*

10 month bullish pennant casually ending on Monday Oct 18th on $GME lol front page buying pump and dumps why do you retards hate money?
Not a 🌈 🐻 but SPY $438P
**Reason why $SPY will always go up**

Main requirement to join the S&amp;P 500:

&gt;last reported quarter must be profitable ✅

&gt;aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ✅

Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in todays economy.

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 10-20 unprofitable loser companies get delisted from S&amp;P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy constantly and always follows profits.

betting against a stock thats sitting at all time lows and has the number one momentum behind it of any stock right now is how you certify yourself as WSB's most retarded retard.
Good luck with that, although personally, I would never buy a china stock. Puts on China are the same all calls on America. Has Jack Ma ever actually been seen again?

Maybe next week is when the big pop will happen once the whole Entain deal is finished or doesnt go through
You seem to not know when big tech earnings run-up happens.

Doesn’t hurt when your dad does it behind the Wendy’s dumpster….  🤷🏻‍♂️
Sell a call and buy a call you're fucked. Sell a call and sell a put you're golden
NVDA better start turning on the rockets
LOGI has been drilling for months for no reason. I'm buying the dip.
10/22 V 230 Calls easy money if you watch the stock. Sometime in the next two weeks it will run up to 231. I'm guessing after the drop today it will be in the next 3 days. Unload your position then.4 10/22 V 230C's  


Edit: If not I'll unload my position for a small loss. Not gonna ride this into next week.
Don't worry man it's just for the memes 😳

I sold last time it got to $18 for a zesty profit. I’ll maybe buy back in when it gets back to $16.

Thetha gain is fucking up everyone's calls between 438 and 440. It's a holiday.  Let them have their cake

Umm...  it doesn't appear so.
If this rejects again I'm going to cry myself to sleep
Idk what’s going on with solar, but I bought puts on SPWR. That 11% increase sus
I have 8 contracts, so I could trim. But to be clear, 55% is only like $650... so it's just not satisfying enough to reduce the position size and mitigate future profits. But those obviously aren't guaranteed anyway. Idk, I just hate to see it dip back down to $16 hah.
SPY: Sorry boo, I was afk 😘

I just opened a handful of weeklies like half an hour ago thinking it was a dead cat bounce right as SPY was at a spot it could collapse or bounce higher, and it went higher so I lost. I’ll hold for another day or so
If FB would just hit $333.33 for close that would be pretty cool.
Oh what a wonderful ~~world~~ market \~

SPY calls 10/15 $450-$455 OI= 414,936
Sofi was always a long term play.
TSLA how many times you gonna reject that sweet 800
Sofi calls are so green
"Non profit" news made the stock drop 90%. It didn't recover. So it actually means no profits for you.
I may have brought above $40 but at least I had the sense to sell at $28

Lol so both AFRM and UPST drop about $5 and then go up $10 together holding hands. Till death do them apart
lol at everyone who pushed TLRY last week and told me buying OCGN at 6.80 was dumb.
Go ahead and keep falling SDC. Much appreciated
No idea man, people just stopped talking about telecom. Only thing I can find  is that:

"Wireless/cable are gearing up for an industry market share war, and the new iPhone 13 promos clearly indicate competition is intensifying," said Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan in a report.

So less revenue and less profits in the short term. Probably just going to hold these shares forever.
Link?

because it's a nothing event.  This is what smart investors do.  buy a dip caused by innuendo and nothingness, knowing it's going back up.
I too would like to shill this stock to pump my bags and to avoid my banbet
Market chose violence today against the bears.
I like scooters and better than to have panic sold last week lol. Would’ve tech been the financial equivalent rn of buying a Corolla and lighting it on fire

Damn dudes. CouldA averageD down on my TSM  120c when they were at 2.30.  Missed buying the dip cuz i was at my bullshit waitering job on Wednesday.


Now im profitable on a paltry amount of calls 🤦‍♂️
we all know DKNG is $100 eventually so can it just go there already wtf
Because her credibility is on the line. Unless Test-to-stay programs take off exponentially DNA is short term fucked. 3.1 million float is easy to manipulate.

I don’t think this relationship with SPY options is working out
Make it so when the ticker is on the naughty list, you have to post a ban bet about the ticker before being allowed to mention said ticker.
Lol good luck I told you to sell last week at 441 for theta and switch to a longer date but you didn’t want to listen.
But we buy options here
This is the way, buy high sell low!

Oh I thought today was last day for dividend. Thank you

Is there any other kind?  If you’re a white boy that is.
You'll always lose if you fall for shit like WISH
Well bond market closed today we’ll just hope it doesn’t shit all over tech tomorrow
Sofi
It has been. Good luck this week though.
I was a GME bag holder after buying at 22
Yeah I wont touch that. I want to. But I know itll burn me real bad probably
I bought sofi and bros a month ago and all they did was bleed my account dry. Of course as soon as I sell them on Friday they each moon 11% today

Edit:  bros up 16% now, of fucking course

It has 0 shares available to borrow at a fee of 160% when they do pop up. I thought it was primed for takeoff as well but it gets no momentum cuz they pissed so many people off. It could be a $100 stock if they didn't take away the buy button...

And my sanity too
TLRY has a lot of positive sentiment right now, not so much here, but on other platforms it is 🔥
It takes a couple days for the purchase to record so there was no point in buying more after 10/5 if the Ex Div date is 10/7.
But a least some of us made money of TMC.. That was a short term play and we expected it to tank afterwards.. We still waiting for some SDC gain porn
No it’s called averaging down to ensure you don’t miss out on a pump.

Tal shorts are increasing. Definitely one to watch. Nothing wrong with the company itself other than US pulling funding
You're always better off selling calls than biying puts if you are thinking of the market dropping. Theta is at least on your side.

do not fuck with USO. take this from someone who got 20k in calls last year at the bottom and took over a year to break even. better off with actual companies.

$LUV cancels a shit ton of flights and people buy the dip back up to where it almost was Friday. This market is hilarious.
Must be in ex-div for the last 5 years lol.
[deleted]
I may not be able to knock the bottom out of it but I can damn sure tear some sides up!
Welcome new TLRY bag holders! Like I said when it was $11.20
I wouldn't have it any other way
Same but spy puts and sleeping
trying to stay off the most mentioned tickers so shit doesn't tank
Bought at 15 and sold at a loss, fml xD
!RemindMe In 2 Days
SOFI stays rippin
🐻 us
Remember the time ford exploited child labor, me too, so it should dump now
ARKK puts i ll get
Red by close.
Keep seeing old tickers tired of it now. Any new ones?!?!?
Any idea why they keep bleeding?  I understand T has bad brand image but VZ is a great company.  Especially puzzled by vz.  Do insiders know something?
OCGN has the real potential and y’all focusing on TLRY! Ha WSB
Lost so much on HOOD calls the last 2 weeks.
The Man holds it down
So, put simply.. you’re wrong and a retard
good money in sword fighting fort sure, and will give your wife a break (plus you can finally get some too)
Actually you know what that’s a fair statement given the context of this community
11/22?
CHPT goes ✈️✈️✈️
That's what makes it so tragically beautiful. You dont have to but you do anyway
Finally my SOFI shares are giving me some return
Lol.  Yeah.  Didn't want to miss out after watching stupid stocks like clov go from 7 to 24.  I'm just throwing random gambling money at it.
My 12/22 $21 calls need a solid bump
That’s true
[deleted]
Man you are retarded, at the top of the main thread a mod posted the instructions
How did the TLRY earnings play work out for everyone?
If I knew when it would come out I would have waited.
Gd luck
SDC goons quiet
$CLF $SOFI $ZIM $APPS $TRMR
Chpt you got this I just need it to break 22
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

&gt; your kinda of retarded tbh.

LoveurOther15, 2021
we need to start voting on what to go into
You did the whole time spamming it don’t take back statements now.
Xom
yeah man Ive been bag holding these garbage stocks for months. Oh and dont forget TMUS. "gRaB tHeSe 5G sToNkS bEfOrE tHeY rIp!" my ass....
I'm only in sdc because I finally gave into hope for a meme rally for no reason.  So there.  I literally am just gambling that other assholes will buy so I can get out before they do.
B-B-B-BIG things on the horizon
Calm before the storm? Bond market closed today? Who knows. Definitely didn't expect this crazy green after Friday's close. I would have expected red due to CPI and FOMC September minutes on Wednesday...
FB is a $420 stock trading at a 25% discount.
It will be $50 by 2023 just buy now
bears should stick to spreads or deep otm single leg puts if they plan to hold.
we need to reogranize wsb were a mess right now
They are
Love you brotha
Low volume hoilday not likely to move much
I actually took the bait on SDC at $6.70.  Why must I listen to you retards?
its easy af if you leave it alone.
In AMZN since they pushing for legalization of marijuana
Buy CLF Cornsucks. My dong is made of steel.
do you own the stock?
I was told China was going to crash everything?
Only the 🌈 team
Its going to the moon, you will be a bystander
RIOT finally moving nicely
It's not the size, it's how you use it.......to a certain point before it becomes the size again
He has been buying these calls since they were worth more than $1 they are currently worth .08 don’t buy those shit calls
HOOD looks like it could take off from here
Not only does the market go up over time puts are way more expensive then calls. If your a perma bear your kinda of retarded tbh. Pick yours spots sure but if ur bear 24/7 just wake up and put a red propeller hat on legit
When I'm in that position I usually just let them get called away. The only time that might not be a great idea is if you think it's going to rip way past your strike. You could buy back at at a loss and make up some of that loss by selling further OTM. But if it keeps ripping you'll be in the same position next week. Tough call.
Wow, that stonk is in complete free fall the last few weeks!
I don’t have the glass ball of when the infastructure package comes out.
$UWMC is making moves so I just yolod on some calls fuck it right?
I am in need of a diamond award
Sofi $20 eow?
On Sofi as a small hedge against my shares. Bullish as fuck on them but they pop and dip hard so small put position for this week just put in
The results are in. The most difficult thing on earth is to actually make money in the stock market.
Chpt better not blue ball me by the end of the day
Here comes the slow fade sorry bulls
Damn, might see 425 by Friday
Just wait for Chamath to sell
Takes that long  just to get them off the ship anchored waiting to get into the dock
Still you have a great chance
The company is also way overvalued
Any reason why some guys celebrate having a small dick? Why aren’t they embarrassed
RIOT.

&amp;#x200B;

Broke the 27.40 resistance line and now looking like it's trying to break that 27.80 resistance.

&amp;#x200B;

Could be a healthy afternoon for the corn miner.
If you can roll for a credit and don't want to part with it then do that. You also have decent gain at the 18 strike plus premium and letting it get called away is not a bad idea.
thanks galactic virgin!
whos buying puts in this market?
You could’ve bought quadruple the calls you have rn today 😂😂 retard
I'm just here for SDC tears to sustain me as I toil away carrying these pltr bags for the rest of time. It's not much but its honest work
[deleted]
Not for us put holders ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
💎💎✋✋
Nice flair.
Copy that
Two SPY calls at 441,  for 10/13
no that's definitely TMC. It's already in the ninth circle of hell
Show me one decent gain porn post
Selling otm GME calls is like an infinite free money hack.
I own SOFI, bought at $14 and hoping it will go up to target range of $24-$30
USO $65c 11/22/21

You're welcome.
Saw a lot of articles with "sentiment toward china stocks is changing" ... sounds like they will go down again.
I should have taken the day off like I said I would.


Now I’m afraid I’m gonna have to watch all my gains disappear
damn, SOFI is ripping.  i regret not buying at 16
👀
Doesn’t matter averaging down
Why is TLRY down all the time
Do your own research and quit watching CNN. Read the reports by the University of Arizona and University of Colombia...natural immunity is far superior so unless you are old or have compromised immunity, quit being a little bitch
I'm going to say it.


I don't care about your CLOV or SDC yolo.

It's about to hit 18 today.

What should I do? I bought SOFI cause I read it here, then I sold covered calls caused I read something about theta gang and idk?

Should I roll out, let it get called away, close pos?

White boy summer anyone!!!!???
we all still in this - LFG SDC
Right on! It has been quite well behaved in the wedge to my surprise. I held off for a few weeks sitting on XX shares, grew a pair and got some calls and more shares. Barely 1k or so but I am poor ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Lmao bro just checked 450c 10/15 it’s trading at .08 and you said it was enough time.. You have to be trolling at this point I warned you last week about theta
This will be around for like a month or two and go away.  Hope I can scalp some gains up or down
440 spy calls not looking so hot , i need copium feed me
It’s ok spy. 450 eow and we’re fine.
SPY puts 10/15 $420-$415 OI= 254,820

SPY calls 10/15 $450-$455 OI= 414,936

Looks like this sub is still full of clov pumpers.... sad to see WSB is still in such a state.
Imagine thinking the markets are fair and efficient 🤡
Absolute cretin.
I am offended by history. This was my safe space.
All these posts dogging CLOV just make it more noticeable and people are eventually going to jump in again.
Watch SOFI gang not take profit again and ride it all the way back to $15 again
That’s pussy shit
Good. I love my momma.
Yolo
CLOV and WISH take offense to that
Obummer sux
Smile Direct Club more like Frowns Direct Club

PENN doesn't give a fuck which way SPY is going... hopefully my calls print
The conspiracy is that we're reaching peak oil production which explains the accelerated totalitarianism.....so yeah, solar.
!banbet SOFI $18 15m or I’ll buy 100 $18c FDs
I highly doubt that is gonna happen

switched from calls to puts after multiple failures to stay above 440... seemed like a bull trap to me but if we rally again, it's because of my puts and you're welcome
Just went in on 10/15 SPY 450c, so all the bears can safely start prepping for lambos as every play I make is a guaranteed inverse

Lol, can you imagine how much their homes would be worth now and how much money they'd have if they'd just left their life's savings in the market during the greatest bull run in history? 

Bears are the believers in crap like ancient Mayan predictions for when the world will end. Meanwhile, all the market does is go up while they're busy trying to be a broken clock that's right at least twice a day.

Gme was a garbage stock too
I feel like buying $FB right now is going to make you rich in 2 weeks after earnings, buying at $328-329 is a steal considering that when the whole market was down + fb, insta, whatsapp went down + whistleblower scandal fb only dropped to 326
I’m so close to buying like another 50 contracts of 450C 10/15

Clov won the Stock Wars, it's the ONLY stock now.
Yet both have had to previously get every vaccine under the sun, but this one with two billion test subjects already is asking too much?

CLOV is coming back to 9 soon,
Hell yeah just 12 more years of uninterrupted bull market and I can finally break even and exit my ARK positions
Clov back to 7’s that pop didnt last long . Puts way to go

Haven't the nurses and teachers been through enough shit the last 18+ months? Now they have to deal with Draconian tyranny? Of course they are saying bye-bye
Looks sick
As a SPCEtard, and a PLTaRd bag holder it feels good that the bags are a little lighter today.  Hoping the gains today will stick.
Sure this time will be different LOLOLOLOLO fucking lucky charms tards
Nope it is not
Every stock I sell pumps after, I just can't win
OCGN possibly closed above 8 on this Friday 10/15/2021
It's staying up there. The bands are narrowing as always around this time so it'll be sideways till about noon
Bags heavy
Yeah tomorrow finna be a dip. Puts around 3 to get a head start into the sour hour eh? This finna a repeat of Thursday
ban bet it please
Better to trade flat than be down 60%
fuck those data capping bastards
That would be a godsend for counter DD comments.

I love my flair though.
Hoping my GTE calls print.

I’m about to sell an iron condor on amzn

The fuck do you think it means you retarded cocksucker
I made this thing yesterday, see my flair?

Comment Count - Submission Count - First Seen - Ban Bet W/L

If I can figure out how to get PRAW to actually apply a color, what do you think? Would you like to be able to toggle (optionally) flair stats on and off, clearing your current flair?
i may gotten too ahead of myself with spy calls , im going to need spy to hit 440 at least holy fuck.
I mean the short case is much more believable than "the next tesla!" bull case
You think wsb users cause price movement?
Seen Ryan's latest tweet in front of GS

...he doesn't fuk around 

GME on a collision course with the moon
i got 430 and 431 bags for nov 1. It was in 1k at one point and then it gapped over night..
Fuck, is it going to be a flat then EOD dump kind of day for SPY?
always with the fucking squeeze nonsense
The AAPL chart is EXACTLY like SPY/QQQ 

That’s how important the damn 🍏 is
this ban bet thing is a joke right? I’m not really getting banned right?
My body my choice, my money all gone
Y’all watching AMC right?
Sell far otm naked calls.
Ties up a lot of collateral tho
You really want attention huh
Because it’s a pump and dump scheme. I guess you’re the only fool who fell for it
AMD makes me MAD
I’m a condescending dick even if all my bets are wrong, what are you on about
Right? The only stock not bouncing back today.
It’ll probably hit 445

Whats a banbet my master?

Oh lord have mercy plz be on the sell side
I would like to have a word with the smallest penis possessor in the room. This club is going the wrong way.
He needed to protect himself so he banned himself
The market prices in all available information. This doesn’t mean just because the majority are bullish that they are correct. I agree that if it were so obvious inflation data is going to be bad then we would be red today, but I don’t think it’s going to be as confident as the market is making it out to be.
Rumors going around that spy is going to go below $438 real soon. Top people saying it
Because feds bought the top
Thank you for your service bears! I’ll take your puts off your hands now they are on sale
Stock market makes no sense
SQ you pos 🤬
Why did you buy stock in a garbage drop ship company that is literally a meme for delivering trash to their customers?
The biggest decline in the jobs report was government employees, including gov subsidized companies like IBM and AA, as well as healthcare workers. If you were bullied into doing something you don't want to do, what would you do? If you don't, they fire you, but you'll receive severance or UE insurance because you didn't break any law
I bought the exact top before a drop and ended -20% in a few days. Who would have thought i will be green in a week. Now i know which stock to buy on a crash
The chart for SPY’s first hour today is so ridiculous, lmao. SPY said son, FUCK your puts

Whatever. I’m holding these 10/18 435p until they’re green or worthless. Bought at 3.16, currently at 2.00
it's called "shitposting" y'all...

is irony really ded??

Exactly! I can now invest 3$ instead of $3,000
why do i have a feeling spys going back down
Cmon SPY don’t roll over
Nah

At least you didn’t short the E Mini. I deserve this.
[deleted]
Do you think spy bounces off the 90 ma
You're going to have to shave your ass and lie about it being your wife's. I vote that still counts though.
RIOT mined more than MARA in Sep. yet MARA has been seeing bigger gains lately?? I agree RIOT is due for a big upswing.
It has legitimate potential. It’s not one of these EV, deep sea mining or space spacs that will never even get off the ground. The actual numbers are daunting, though. It’s losing money hand over fist and costs are going up twice as fast as revenue.
If you say so big daddy
it’s being diluted idk about it
SPY is so last year. Everyone wants those awesome 20 year treasury yields now.
Just remember: market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent
Loss r future gains
I guess the market is positive about Wednesday's CPI data?
I decided to buy the dip. Bad choice?

Yeah exactly. They are also forcing people to show their vaccination cards like a damn dictatorship it’s ridiculous. But that’s bullish I guess and LUV is now back over 53. It’s like the most logical play is always the wrong one man it sucks.

I really don't think we'll break it till later this week when the market is fully open and people aren't on vacation

My high score is 1, but I like giving condescending advice anyway.
Any other Spanish &gt; Mexican Spanish
We will retrace 30-50% of today’s gains and the bears will pretend they are winning.
It literally doesn’t make any sense. That’s why I hate this 99% of the time. As for southwest’s case ik someone that works for them and he is telling me they are starting to force vaccinations and it’s causing a lot of turmoil idk if that’s the reason southwest is cancelling flights but how the fuck is that bullish how the fuck is that raising the stock? The market makes no sense I’m about to give up and take a break at this point lol
wow 1.5 hours of movement determines that its a loser? interesting. in going to laugh at you so hard soon

Lifetime up 21k . Im referring to the second bullet i fired into the account. Had to pay off college so there went my gains.
Why you say that? Any evidence?
Damn son I almost bought MARA 10/15 $40c last week at $.50. They’re now about $3.50. I went with HUT 🤕
Just thinking the same thing considering they already had 12% cancellation this morning before 9am
I must lack vision because I just don't see that as a possibility.

Riot has become disassociated with the price of btc. They had an offering a couple months ago that completely fucked up the price. Seems like it’s starting to get back on track
Honest opinion please: is CLOV a pump and dump or a growth company with legitimate opportunities?
And you would think speculation regarding that data would cause the market to be red today. I don’t think investors understand the correlation…

Do I fucking DARE doubling down my gains and buying 0dte SPY puts???
Havent seen this one before..
Kicking myself for not buying more. I averaged up one time..just waiting now, will buy any pullback. Web3.0!!
Bears likely to have control for the day if SPX under 4397
Buying spy calls for 2098
the "crash" was just FUD
He bought?….. you know the rest
-71% YTD
Crash took the day off.
Have you tried the tapping technique?  I know it works for some, but not everyone of course.
I would like to present you with the GME award 


🍆
&gt;them over At&amp;t any day (and I do) Sure VZs 5 year is flat but Ts 5 year is down almost 32%. Plus their dividend isn’t staying high as it is I’m sure, and VZ just increased theirs. As for Oil, I know most people are doing CVX over XOM, I personally hold BP, which I’m happy with

Someone didn't RTFM.
I don't know how the market is mooning when the used car index, lumber, wages are all higher than the previous month's reading. Not to mention the supply chain shortage is at a peak. I think we're going to get murdered by Wednesday's inflation data.
BABA is doing it again
Sorry y’all my strike was $441 and SPY always reverses a dollar under my strike, sorry
It hurts everywhere
you might actually be retarded if you dont realize this is a theta day
It was pumped because it was upgraded Friday, what meme stock are you in?
Listen to Pink noise
Sure, one-stop banking, lending, investing for individuals and small business, with synergies baked in because of the comprehensive back-end platform.

You tell me which one I described and which one doesn't fit the description, though, because I'm not sure.
🤡 me, down 29%
All the bankers r home making their inside plays on their sisters step kids acct today
Just need it to go up $13 and we good!
No I’m more of an introvert. Why do you ask?
RC tweets and GME moons. Fucking algos
Waiting to see if SPY breaks 440.  Then I buy puts at 442
I was thinking of doing the same.  Thanks for your sacrifice.  I'll put your name on my lambo license plate.
Looked into my crystal ball, and said SDC will hit $9 and IRNT will recover to $15.
You mean the stock that's up 3% today? Sure, maybe.

Congrats you've finally figured out the most obvious plays are usually wrong. Wall Street doesn't give out too many freebies
whether or not GME is a good play, GME ruined this entire sub with the amount of noobs that joined.  its really as simple as that. if you are reading this and you were not apart of the sub before 2021, then you dont really have any idea how good this sub used to be.
Tinnitus is really fucking annoying mentally. Had it for several years now and i try my best to block it out mentally (like I hear it but I try not to think about it) but it really sucks. And there’s no ‘cure’. Thankfully I haven’t had it my whole life but I miss having a good ear. Sorry for the rant. Just one of those mornings i guess

I have been patient as fuck with RIOT. 

Lived through a prolonged low and slow meltdown.  Saw money just falling away.

But I clutched my bags tightly and cried myself to sleep.

Certain digital coins would rise in value, the amount of these mined by RIOT would increase significantly, but the share price would nonetheless continue its ride down. 

On Friday, I finally started to give up.  I did not sell any shares, but I sold covered calls on a significant portion of my holdings.  Deep ITM covered calls.  Basically, an exit strategy where I get burnt but not as bad as it could be.

Today, RIOT volume is... let's just call it elevated.  Nearly 4 million shares have been traded in the first hour of trading.  The price is already up over 6% on the day.  My covered calls?  Already down about $4k on the day.

RIOT looks like it may go into orbit.

Who is a ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)?   Me.  I am a clown.

SPY to 600. When can I buy cheap 10/22 SPY 450c?
It was HYLN, but I cut the cord this morning.  48% loss.
BB 😎
Wsb is disarray as GME tards are back on daily.
Everyone says play with house money, I started with $6500 up $2700 taking out the $6500 paying credit card bills and legit just using house money. Coming from someone who put my last dollar on the line many times this is 10000 times less stressful feels good and makes it feel like im not gambling.
You made a really short custom ban bet (None) which was not accepted.
Don't put any text after the time token (1m, 1w, 15d) if you don't intend to carry out an interesting punishment to get unbanned early.

doesnt make sense with the companies earnings its not a $25 stock. I tapped out a while ago but know that feeling.
This feels like asking a pack of shrieking chimpanzees about astrophysics but I’ll try anyways

True or false: it’s stupid to look at charts like [this](https://twitter.com/factset/status/1447280525669027846?s=21) and say the market is overvalued given the massive changes in the s&amp;p’s composition. tech firms with &gt;&gt;20% annual growth and ~100% gross margins have replaced old industrial dinosaurs with low margins and huge capex needs. So the index *should* trade higher than in the pre-big tech era and it’s dumb to expect a reversion the historical average. 

How retarded on a 1-10 scale?
Give it a week. It’s just like the increase every quarter where they get too big for their britches the day it goes up with the rest of the market and are then silent when it crashes lower
Spoiler: LUV puts was not the play this morning.

Last week on Thursday WTI and Brent pumped \~1.5% and COP and XOM stayed flat. On Friday they popped like a mofo while WTI barely made any gains.

This looks like the same set up but the question is do I have the balls to get in?

For all the shilling bots are doing for CLOV, there’s barely any movement. Not a good sign for the snake oil salesman Chamath stock. People don’t forget so easily
Personally, holding still in SKLZ, hit a new low for today but the options are attractive. Didnt buy todays dip but cant be down for much longer, whose in it?
Idk wth is wrong with it but cheap rn, their revenue is insane
Why SPY so gay at $440?

THANKS M8. STILL HOLDING
BuT fUTuReS WeRe ReD
Idk I’m thinking about buying some tech puts eod if we keep rallying
Why is everyone mentioning CLOV for this week? Is there a catalyst?
Whoa top 100 all-time poster achievement
For some extremely gay reason I do not have any settled funds to trade with today
Don’t tell me gme is doing that thing again ….
Lol anyone who buys it should have their mouth removed like that scene in the Matrix so we don’t have to listen to the autistic screeching
It’s totally different business lol

Edit: not totally, but definitely different
GME DOGPILEEEEEE
Where is my guy that calmed me down this weekend and said I would be 100% fine with my 444 calls.
Almost where it was 2 months ago
Why is SPY rising? Are there any news?
Are a $1900 loss in 0dte 440 calls thinking it could fall out at any moment. Such a chicken shit
Godspeed crayon eater we’ll see the victor when the dust settles
bntx? do something pls
440 is cool, but 450 is a lot cooler
yeh faang.. storyline all yr. 80% stocks below 200ma
Where JPow and his money printer? My spy calls are lime green, I want that shit bruce banner gamma radiation green.
Bears were out in full force earlier. Just proof that we have no clue wtf we are doing
AAPL: BRRRRRRRRRRRRRR 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Honest question:  What does SOFI do, or promise to do, that SQ isn't doing already with a 10-year headstart?
Buy puts bitch
Spy can’t keep getting away with this…
Yeah, it seems you have to buy it first
*hERe CoMEs tHe DiPp bUlLs!!!*

Bloomberg wants the ratings so they are now bringing on 🤡s as guests, taking a play from CNBC Playbook.

Also, a lot of the on air personalities on CNBC came from Bloomberg.
Would have actually been the right move for once 🤦🏻‍♂️
GME going up!
Bought $10k of BABA, just felt right
So glad that my trades on my cash didn’t settle yet because I’d be in trouble with the puts that I put an order in 😅
TLT dangerously low..

treasury yields creeping up again..

Bond market closed today. Whats going to happen tomorrow?
You are a god amongst men
GME on a massive bull run
there was a lot of rocket fuel bought that is why market and oil up are up
BROS up 10% yet my $55 10/15 calls aren’t budging. I think maybe I bought a little too high?
440 lets goooooo
Can Zuck stop messing around and bukkake on this market already?
Gmeeeeeeee 🚀
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)

SQ sucks again....of course that's what I bought today, rather than literally anything else.  🤮
Bro we are struggling for that 440 SPY
No. Not happening. Bond market ain't open today and I think the 10yr is gonna go vertical when it does. I don't see this rally going for 2 days more
Spy puts GUHHHHH
is it me or does everything Cathy Woods buys get shorted instantly?
Morgan Stanley upgraded SOFI… time for puts
GLBE dip worth buying before lockup expiry or NAH ?
Do some research on the infastructure bill
could be a fake pump on WTI. be careful. If it pump fakes oil stonks will fall hard.
Nobody remembers you. There is a million retards here. 😂
Goin short on SPY and QQQ…. See you retards in Valhalla…
Told you brother, never trust futes
Dug myself a hole by buying vxx calls. How gay was that. Switched to spy calls.
You saying its calculated is already better than 70% of people in here
SPY 430p 10/15 locked and loaded 😬

Ah, there's the fade I've come to know and loathe.  When will I learn to sell my winners at 10 am and buy them back at noon?
I’m not him but I think it’s pretty fuckin unlikely. Would basically need to keep going straight up like this until then. Can’t give back any gains, can’t have a flat day or red day.
SPY 0dte $438 x 30 saving my life rn

But how much are you down overall
Yeah definitely keep buying OTM puts. That makes perfect sense.

GUH my puts
spy mooning yes!!!
RBLX SQUEEZING!!! IM GONNA COOOOOM
Because the banned poster is back in and he got his pump and dump minions / alt accounts to spam the subreddit

It's crazy now that RH shows option price history. You see a contract that was $4,000 a month ago and you just bought it for $150

Iron prices doing well. Might have to pick up some more VALE
Apes next
Taking every ounce of me not to fomo
This is about to reverse huh
I thought the market was closed today lmao
Sell unless you want to watch it slowly decrease all day. Look at the weak open volume.
futures were down -0.6% at the time, so SPY was effectively much lower. I live to shitpost another day.
OTM TSLA calls expiring Friday.
If u have puts... yes.
the culling has begun
They would love it
Elon release a new car to drive this bitch up 5%

The spreads on the Oil ETFs are insane
BABA, NVDA, or ROKU leaps? This will be my first true YOLO.
Clov cant hold a gain for shit
I never liked trading on a Monday. Feels like bad luck
This shit is just not good for my mental health at this point
Because it's the P&amp;D du jour.
I'm doing something wrong. 6 days in a row with no losses.
My spy $439 calls are up 60%. Bought 100 of them. Sell or hold. What's your EOD predictions
7 hours of fading or no movement after 10am. the new stock market! so much fun. cant wait to drop 10% on all my holdings for earnings season again!
TSLA made me rich once, can it do it again?
Could bank holiday make people not want to sell because they don't get the money yet anyway? Would think it also makes people equally hesitant to buy but maybe not
What’s new back to $770
being banned from this place for a week may be the real reward.
Stagflation, ‘transitory’ or nah? 🤔
Bull market next two weeks.
Cant put food on the table if you dead tho. And they arent forcing them. They can pull themselves up by the bootstraps and come work for me at wendys. Imagine giving up your job because you afraid of a vax taken by billions safely LMAO what cucks
CLOV, is that all u got u little Bitch?
Hey guys. What are your plays for today ? :)
Yeah, I also find it hard to believe we dump hard with so much cash sitting on the sidelines waiting for this to bottom out to buy back in.
These fucking infiltrators and their p&amp;d schemes.. SDC, I should have known by how forced it felt in this subreddit with all these screenshots with $100,000,000 in 0dte $10 calls
Ugh NET is unstoppable. That 109 dip was such an opportunity
Imagine trying to flip your stack on a Chamath stock when there isnt someone going into orbit this week
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Sold my 7 calls 10/15 for profit. Purchase at .65 and sold at 1.01
I see that CLOV is the talk of the town this week. Why is it getting pumped?
Let’s get a short squeeze going
Any other NVDA call holders combine your energy with mine we're climbing to that hilltop this week 🧗🏻
It’s quite satisfying to see that sir pump and dump shilling clov after he panicked clf. Only to see clov goin down and clf going up. 

😏😏😏

There’s nothing on the technicals saying this is dumping. Sure rates can pop hard and tank Nasdaq but short of that we going up
people still get excired about opening pops? insane ifs every single day all year
Buy the top.
Is $mcfe any good
Why the fuck don’t I buy NET on these dips? This stock is a powerhouse
dont sleep yet , watch spy hit 440 while we hold hands together

Just got called a fucking idiot by TOS support. Gonna go to bed. Good luck everybody.
Glad to see it. Turns out it was Cathie dumping 20mil worth on Friday that drove it down. Also, props for being the only recently bearish person who recognized we might be heading for a reversal.

Futes were making my bull dick so hard last night and it was all just a tease. SPY is fucking green and one of my calls still isn't even in the red. I can't buy more calls at these prices, I'm not Jeff Bezos

We break through 440 and bers are toast
I’m sure their asses are clean
These people clearly skipped/failed history 🙄
i really thought the market was closed today
The PL chart lied to me. I bought spreads for CCXI and the breakeven was like $9 and $65. My account is now negative and I'm not even using margin 🤡
GEO is the move
!banbet RBLX 75 1w I'll cover my head in mayonnaise
Let’s go SDC! 7+ this afternoon
You should. 20 trillion is literally not possible. Especially with the state of the planet. You're absolutely delusional
**perpetual bull trap**
Made my banbet when futures were down -0.6%. Just like Columbus day last year; banks are closed and retail buys. Thank god I'm free to shitpost another day.
Calling the top for today.
Bers just fucking give up you guys are pathetic, all that bullshit last night 😂
SDC is giving me whiplash today
$NIO has potential
Apparently there pill needs other medications to be effective so it’s a negative on the stock
Looks like they are dishing out just the "Fuck you"
Everybody Panic!
Don’t worry amzn you can move when you feel like it 😌
my man wiped his profile
looks like some of the momentum has run out for now...

If I buy TSLA calls it’ll drop back to 780

But if I don’t buy calls it’ll go back to 900
Such a beautiful bull trap. Truly majestic

spy calls bought just like buffett said to do. index funds are the way to go
These guys beat their earnings the last 4Q’s by an average of ~38%. Supply chains have been rough the last 2Q’s probably? For some pretty cheap Nov calls, I think it’s a risk worth taking honestly

Remember a year and a half ago when we were dropping so hard that multiple circuit breakers were hit multiple days in a row?

Yeah fun times.
Morgan Stanley joins Jefferies and initiated coverage on SOFI with Buy Rating and PT of $25/share.

SOFI will continue to rise until .... well it doesn't and fall back to $15-$16 range. Then I am sure another bank will initiate coverage and we will have a de ja vue

Won my banbet! on SOFI 17.5 1 week, gonna win it on SPY by Wednesday too.

guys this is your chance to shine! if you get it back over $5 that is a nice BTFD move
CLOV puts easy money
CLOV. if u sour just mad cuz bad
It literally went up 12 bucks on nothing
This rally scaring me. I am such a pussy with no balls 😭
Imagine doubling down on puts after debt ceiling extension and earnings week. Probably anti-vaxxers who think that their 1% quitting jobs will crash the economy.
Anybody rolling with MTTR?
u will regret it
Are the puts printing yet?
Time to go long luckin 🤡
Double down on puts. Thank me later

Perfect time to load up on SPY putz
I googled “transitory definition” clearly google hasn’t got the memo
As you should be
i was honestly hoping for sophie to drop back to 15 to re-buy, but glad to see it mooning today.

guessing its based on the MS price target, but the real catalyst will be the bank charter still pending.

What’s the spy play?
[deleted]
That is remarkably cheap
Let’s go CLOV been a while ole friend
Where are all the banbets?  is that just a weekend thing?
I mean technically the bid is what it's worth
Hmm we kinda pumping should I hop in or is this fake pump and we crash later?? Guh
We call that cash gang
I just put my entire portfolio into 0dye spy calls for the first time im TERRIFIED
If you retards want a real SOFI run don’t even think about selling till $25-$28 or until the bank news releases publicly
Another big day for $CLOV pushing through it all.
Personally I use Robinhood for cash management and plays that need fast liquidity, Webull for savings and plays that need quick access to good research tools, Gatsby for yolo money and plays that need some semblance of security (can't use Robinhood to try to join a short squeeze when they've been known to halt buying for example)

Still looking for a 4th and possibly 5th brokerage tho but can't find the right feature sets so far
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Yeah I missed my fill on AMD would be up over 60% already so pissed
You said you’d be willing to bet, and then wouldn’t offer a wager. I then noticed you might be a little broke bag holding AMC.
For those that have to trade with settled funds, today is a non-settlement day. Everything you sold on Thurs and Friday is gonna settle tomorrow. 

Upside, gonna be hard to overtrade today.
Just noticed that lmao. It’s all retail

What did I miss?
What else do ya use?
Give me $20 before earnings and ill nut

I'd be careful with TA on a stock like BABA. A lot of guys bought puts last week based on resistance, etc. when it was struggling to hold 156 and then it blew up. BABA is just so far out of wack and detached from fundamentals that it's difficult to predict short term.

RBLX oversold. Calls for friday gonna print bigly
I'm personally disappointed Kim and Kanye broke up because Kanye connected with me personally like so many others with his love story about an undying lust for Kim and now perceptions are called into question. It's not like this ruins my life or anything, it might make me more aware of the pitfalls if I ever end up in a similar situation since I can relate to him on the whole liking a woman too much thing. Kanye however might not be benefiting from this parasocial relationship, there's not much evidence being judged by people like me is helping his emotional or mental health. He's done a pretty good job of connecting with his audience but he might not quite have succeeded at making it symbiotic. Hard to tell without seeing more of his life play out

I think there’s a difference between parasocial relationship and someone advocating for people experiencing similar struggles. I would consider PR to be more along the lines of becoming emotionally upset that Kim and Kanye are splitting up rather than identifying with Kanye’s mental illness.

You just skip the oregano and show up uninvited.
I have a theorem that the relationship is more likely to be unhealthy the thicker the fourth wall is so financial figures like Ryan Cohen would correlate strongly with unhealthy parasocial dynamics with their followers because they have no transparency and the fourth wall with them is a fuckin reinforced brick and concrete wall with tiny sliding steel windows

Emergency rooms are hanging by a thread, there are no new nurses or doctors to take the place of those quitting either due to burnout or vaccine mandates.  Hospitals are needing to pay RNs $120/hr or more just to staff a floor.  Elective surgeries backed up for months so no profit for the healthcare org.

The fact that you have discomfort with the role is a good thing: proof that this new gig is stretching you in good ways and providing opportunities to develop new skillsets that you'll be able to translate to higher pay whether at this place or the next one.

Everyone used to tell me that my wife would change alot after we had a kid and I would always laugh and be like "nah she's not like that"


I was incorrect
Different levels of debt, and the debt for established manufacturers is collateralized by existing inventory and reliable forecasting. There’s very little surprises in an industry that mature, and vehicle manufacturer’s are able to hedge against interest rate hikes on their debt by increasing interest on the debt they finance to consumers.

Tech businesses generally get financing in hopes that they will have a profitable venture after they dominate their respective market activity, but that’s more risky in comparison to an already operating, physical manufacturing process.

It’s because Christopher Columbus was a day trader
Yeah I’m not so sure how to feel about the Hunter and csx thing, he was pretty much dead at that point. I worked for CP from 2014-2018, so I was there for a bit of Hunters run. He was in rough shape before he ever left CP, and even when he did he was still guidance to Keith, and then went right back to csx. But most that worked at cp when Hunter left were only surprised because we thought he’d die as ceo, and kind of expected it soonish. 

Sounds bad but railroaders gossip like middle school, no matter how up you are. Just took a quick look at the csx 5 year chart too, March 2017, when Hunter took over was in the $15s, and december when he left/died it was in the 18s, and the 5Y chart doesn’t show it going below 16. 

Hunter was just all about the tight schedules, I think he doubled the train length when he first took over CP, and just cut a lot of unnecessary jobs and expenses. He moved the head office from downtown Calgary with the ridiculous lease and built a new head office on a bunch of open land they already owned. He cut the executive positions from like 8-10 to 4. There’s books about his ideology of running a railroad, and without a doubt he passed all his knowledge on to his son in law. 

I work for a contractor now so I still do some work for cp, so it could also sound like I’m a shill. But CP peaked this year in June at $83, before CN backed out of their deal and all signs point towards CPs getting approved. If CP can get to 83 without acquiring ksu, why would it not get to 100 by 2024, over a year after CP management is expected to takeover operations? It’s the only thing I’ve done this much DD on because I’ve been around it for a while now
Blaming the jab?  Nice scapegoat, there are a ton of factors at play here, that being a pretty minor one, and most being international issues and not localized to US mandates.
$CLOV posts are getting faker, gayer, and more numerous by the minute….. Time to buy puts.

Yeah I see. However, auto companies likes GM or Ford they have a big debt to pay but still perform pretty good compared to big tech names when yield bond surge

It’s the rotation. Money flows out of tech when interest rates rise as you can get yield outside of tech growth.

RIOT is a good one for the rest of the year with huge move higher. RIOT is a digital coin miner and last 3 months was going down and sideways vs coins are doubling in the same time. Once it moves, it has a lot to gain. In addition,  RIOT is holding a huge number of coins that is adding to it's bottom line. It has more coins than MicroStrategy,  but the stock price is much lower. The company is mining more coins every month exponentially, but the stock is at 3 months low. The stock will be at a new high before end of the year.

Tech is primarily growth companies; growth companies grow by using debt as a form of leverage. If interest rates are low, then debt is a cheap way to grow, and the time to break even on the debt is short. If interest rates rise, the time to break even is extended out, making the time to profitability longer. When that timeline is extended, it make the company less valuable.

Stay with this thread you'll nut for months
We may have to amend some trade agreements and maybe a treaty from the 60s.  I’m not well versed on the subject, was hoping someone could provide more insight.
Ok. But last 3 timees it went to 172 n back to 140
Houses in my area have been selling within hours of listing all summer. Now there are a bunch that have sat for about a month, with a couple that did big price reductions. Lower volume, lower cost of living area. Data point for anyone who cares.

I always get anxiety over change and have the same thought process as you but always make myself see it through. 95% of the time, while my concerns at the time were valid, they always end up more trivial than I thought/the situation works out. Being uncomfortable breeds strength. The other 5% are my stock and option positions, those never pan out.

Oh dude you totally could move up.  The bigger mall is a good start. But.. Think what's next beyond sales.  Most businesses need people like you who are good with phones to support their employees.  Mine has 3 people who support ours and I bet they're all pulling 60k or more.  

Apply for positions you don't think you're qualified for.  Business are desperate and will call you.
so far in my t-shirting adventures i haven't found a more comfortable t-shirt at that price point than uniqlo, but one of the shirts i got from them is just dogshit quality and is full of holes now after like 6 months of owning it so idk what happened

Shiri has A+ chesticles undeniably and mayyybe a slightly better face but Hopkins has an awesome personality and would probably be less prudish because she's had to work harder than Shiri.
You think I shouldn't go back? I feel like going back to the same job will just be a mental defeat for me. Having to learn and grow at new position sounds daunting though

CLOV and WISH should merge together - then they’d both be worth about $12 a share ($5 plus $7) and the baggies on both could be made whole

In the eastern half of the country (the half with the greatest population), the past few winters have been relatively mild. Weather tends to follow cycles, and not only are we overdue for a harsh winter, but the weather all spring and summer has been cooler than normal, the leaves here are turning a couple weeks earlier than normal, which indicates to me that it's gonna be a colder than normal winter.

If you think about it, most day traders are pajama traders since you wouldn't put on a suit and tie just to sit at home and watch candles all day.
Why
Yes. Utilizing insider knowledge, no matter what level of employee you are at the firm, to prosper in advance of corporate PR responses, is considered insider trading. 

And while the SEC may not crack down on you, in most publicly traded companies, violating insider trading rules could result in termination. So avoid it if possible.

Yes, if you make trades based on non public info of a company, even if you don’t work there, it’s illegal insider trading. I don’t trade on anything within my employer’s sector at all just in case.

If that was the case why cancel half the flights and not all of them?
If Uncle Dave won’t take you back, I’d suggest a lot of time restructuring from the beginning.
it is if the general public can't find it through research (news, web, etc)
I know its a slight boomer stock but BTI is insanely undervalued at 35. 8.5% div
Evergrande is (was?) not big enough to start some sort of mass financial contagion outside of China.  Only good for doomsday headlines.

I would dump those calls while there's still a little bit of value left in them. No way SPY is gonna make 450 this week. Next week, maybe. Not this week.

Don’t give in dude. Just keep at it. We all have those down days.
it's not like someone out there has all the info and answers about covid and is withholding the info....the reason guidelines and rules and really the entire science behind covid has seemed like it's always changing is because IT IS. It's a brand-new virus that we have never seen before, and the medical professionals and scientists are making decisions everyday with the information they have, which is constantly changing as we learn new information and previously held hypothesis get proven wrong.  This seems so basic and clear to me, and it's honestly mind-boggling how some people take evolving and changing information on something the world has never seen before and point to it as evidence of some grand conspiracy because "the professionals didn't get it exactly right the first time"

Turns out effectively laying the bat on the ball such that you get on base is really hard! Sometimes you get lucky, the best have practiced skill, but it’s still really difficult! Seems a fitting analogy for investing and trading. Hell, even the metaphor for being patient works in some ways.
I agree with you except for southwest. 

Southwest is the result of government overreach. 

Let essential people test if they don't want the jab. It's that simple.

Remember all that "weather" that delayed southwest yesterday?  There's 300 more cancelled today due to "weather".  I wish there were big glass holes on my house that I could verify this claim with or some kind of interconnected electronic weather systems that could show me weather in other areas
Late to the party stay out today, if you have positions book profits today and wait for EIA on Tuesday and weekly data on Wed. re-enter for another run into next week depending

Yeah I’ve been sitting on RDS and MRO shares, selling CCs to build a bigger position so it looks like I’ll be buying some of those back 😬
So many fake and gay CLOV pump posts.
not cute^
Yup all dependent on the winter though, if this winter is warmer than expected oil is going to correct hard. Part of the demand picture is the assumption of Nat gas switching to Heating oil. I’m really hoping for a bullish close into winter, hopefully $90 a barrel but let’s see. Oil tends to have hard sell offs after run ups

You mean the pump and dump that is in the dump phase?

To be fair its probably ready for another pump, wont be as aggressive as the last run to 30, but can likely jump to 25-26 then continue to fade
It's funny watching SDC baggies and CLOV baggies duke it out for the spotlight. It's like watching 2 limp wristed simps going REEEEEEEEEE NO FAIR!1!1

I think Oil and NG are gonna work out well over the next 6 months. Economic issues and FUD notwithstanding, we're heading into heating season, and I think this winter is gonna be colder than average, increasing demand and creating upward pressure on prices.

There was this cool thing that happened a couple weeks ago where I made all my $ back, but now half of it is gone again.
The way you simp Elon 🤯
Once told a shitbag night manager at a grocery store to go fuck himself I quit.  Makes for a nice memory but really wasn't that great
It’s just tech. Everything else is mostly fine now
Exactly, it’s like 100 something years old, still the fastest and most efficient way to ship large amounts of goods. It may be old, boring, low volume, and slow, but the demand will always grow. Getting the first direct Mexico-Canada line is huge, and I think KSU has 3 really good port access points. 

I did a good bit of looking into it, but I’m also a high school educated retard. The current ceo of CP, Keith Creel, is Hunter Harrison’s son in law. To save a long story, Hunter was named railroader of the year multiple times. Once he retired he still mentored and was an advisor to Keith. Hunter dropped CP operating ratio from 80% to 60%, and in the last 3-4 years Keith has it down around 55%. 

Once Keith and the boys takeover Ksu, there’s no way they don’t improve their operating ratio, bump up the trains, the revenue, and of course the natural continued growth. 

Apologies for so much, but deal expected to go through and CP with control I believe late 2022, and at $300 per contract for a 100 strike seems like free money. No matter how boring and low volume, cheap as fuck for what I see a guarantee haha

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
Notice a pattern? Its how wsb works.

1.pumpers buy in
2. Bunch yolos pop up randomly on the front page
3. Stock moons (pump phase).
4. Newbs buy in.
5. Pumpers sell and leave newbs holding bags
6. Back to step 1 with new ticker

Process normally takes 4-5 days total. 2-3 days of pump. Fade follows.

Last week was SDC, this week CLOV.

well, now today will be waiting for CLOV to pump at open and then buying a bunch of puts.

I had SONY calls for last week because I read something about the Yen's historical performance when US Bond yields increase. They expired worthless, but I may try it again this week. SONY looking to open strong today.
Yeah man just looking at premiums this morning and holy shit they're cheap. Obviously they'll probably keep bleeding but news in that sector pops up so randomly. One day they'll get the balls to make a decent effort maybe not until the next blue president
you know rail long is not bad. Cp is too big to fail. Hmm. Leaps good. Thanks for the tip kid ill buy a call.
SDC let’s fucking goooooooooooooooooo
I miss the times when we would be able to say “new daily thread you tards”. Mods took that joy away from me
“Sector”  is a loose word for this market sub section
We’re up like 2.5% lets not get ahead of ourselves. Let’s make the climb to $90 a barrel slow and steady otherwise I’m not confident that these pops won’t just be sold off later in the week
“Resolved”

This is actually correct. I saw some child on here crying because he lost $400 in a casino and that was a lot of money to him.
what's a pyramid scheme called when the pyramid goes downward?  a stone quarry scheme?

If this pays off, I’ll book a flight to MA just to give you a little kiss on the cheek.
I've made 400% on my portfolio with BABA puts. I still think it will continue downwards for a little while longer. If not, I'll swap to more calls than puts 66-33 has been working since May
Still time. Between the bank charter and Morgan Stanley’s 25 price target it could really moon.
As a rule, I don't invest in Canada or anything CP
so which money is the fake money?
the red button. smash it
Anyone BUYING puts on TSLA?
so puts on clov
CLOV posts on WSB are a pyramid scheme

Wanted Sophie calls at open, guess I should've got them before close. 🤷‍♂️
Anaconda Copper is gonna moon!
Bruh it’s up like 2%, I love how the news is that “Oil has skyrocketed over the weekend” but no one says anything when Oil takes like a 10% haircut in like 3 days. We’ve been around this range for almost 3 months no real big movements yet. If we break above $90 that will be big
Today ideally
break-even
WSB only likes stocks that have gone up a lot in a short period.

Soo I'm thoroughly convinced sir pump&amp;dump alot has a bunch of bot accounts and is rallying the bag holders from the last time clov got p&amp;d this is just getting out of hand now
There isn’t anything more I want from this world then for fake money to die
By what year?  I do think SOFI will reach that price again, but might touch the 10-13 range on the way.
It's a 12 month price target you nonce.

If weed stocks keep dying and grandpa's approval keeps dropping a few months down the road I may have to get some LEAPS. Hate buying weed stocks tbh but thinking next year dems might just try and get a legalization push going to save some face before midterms. I doubt they'll really do it but maybe they'll start mentioning it again to drum up young votes
Bearish markets tend to be choppy and mean reversion days hurt leveraged ETFs because they lose money constantly rebalancing (beta slippage). You would buy YANG calls if you think it's going to go down smoothly, but YINN puts if you think it's going to go up and down but mostly down.

And why is BABA mooning now ? I did not see any progress newswise, or policy wise
If Canadian Pacific’s deal with with Kansas City southern goes through, the far otm leaps are dirt cheap. 2024 expiry 100 strikes are like 3.50. First direct rail line Canada to Mexico, CP leadership will cut jobs/expenses like they did at CP bringing operating ratio down. 

Anyone have any thoughts on this boomer stock? $100 is well within reach by 2024, although it relies pretty heavily on the stb approving the deal

Fearful and also rich.

Good thing i have straddles. Now im losing with both calls and puts

I’m not bearish on them, but it’s a risky play until they have an agreement in place for upstream supply. You can have as many contracts to supply lng to people as you want, but if you don’t actually have any physical lng to sell you’re not going to get very far.

Edit: And the fact that they haven’t built their facility yet. Building delays could cause issues with the supply agreements they’ve signed.

Guess I was right about buying Cenovus Energy
I love the people who fap to premarket knowing were all fuqqed
The only way to hedge your portfolio this week is to put it in SOFI
Fucking hate how admins of FB groups take 8 hours to approve a post, bitch turn the review shit off
Just break down and give it up behind the Wendy's dumpster and you'll finally be able to afford something to eat.  Sometimes if you look in the right spot you can even find it for free.

I really meant the last two weeks but you’re welcome
I need a pump (looks down...no not there yet) for my CLOV "investment".  It hasn't exactly been the flight to tendie Town I expected.  This bags are heavy and I'm old.
What situation? It's only premarket chill
Instructions unclear, googled 2 chicks 1 cup
What would expect them to do? Why does it even matter
Who is that
📉📉📉
I don’t know why I thought Europe would help the situation.
Not so much the next team e we play
Doesn't matter, soon we'll all be extinct. Puts on life

Puts on the Qs.
Agreed, theta coming to get everybody.

As expected, now the question is - will it have any real impact on the market today?

Good start to the week
Bloody Monday.
A.k.a sir p&amp;d alot

Why?
What is a theta day?
Glad I put all my portfolio back into Sofi on Friday
Please do.
Gonna be another theta day, plan accordingly. Good day.
SDC is most likely on the back side of its move
Someone give me the bear case on TELL

Why are people saying CLOV? Wasn't that meme a few months ago?
Question for amd merging with xlnx, will price down or up?
Good to see the CLOVer in the 8’s . 9-10 calls printing today
stop lying it is kinda bad, at least nasdaq
If your president aint Camacho you ain't black ...
Thanks buddy. Haven’t been watching futures tonight. Good looks
There is only one play for the next two weeks and that is SDC. You don’t hear about it yet on this thread cos all the retards are still asleep.
going to start an INTC position
The way shit has been going. End of day IMO
I've never made it past 75, it's the muscle fatigue that gets me, I get so bored doing nothing. Good luck though

Hi everyone my names 2high4life and I’m a retard. *hi retard* So anyway is open the time to buy 0dte spy calls or should I just wait till close and buy 2dte spy calls.
That’s where it ended last week. Bond market closed today.
Skirt skirt
The second day is always the hardest.  But fasting for just one day clears my head and lowers my anxiety.
Lol is this real?
Yum
Sebo Felix, best vacuum I ever bought. Never thought I’d spend $700 on a vacuum, but here we are.
Careful of organ damage.
Might start a conflict just to stoke some nationalism sentiment
I think I need to start doing moderate amounts of cocaine every morning.  Not as much as Cramer though.
10-year Treasury yield tops 1.61% to start the week  
So, even when there were not many new jobs added, Treasury yields keeps going up. And if there were added record number of new jobs, then Treasury yields would be even higher. 

So, it all means that this time, banks will rise and Nasdaq will drop?
Fair but it’s doing well pre market while the markets are red.
i feel like all my stocks  been flat for years
Where’s your precious 10yr to guide your panic shits, boomers? Oh that’s right, Columbus told you to fuck off today.
It's an amazing experience to fast for longer period. I'm sure you will like it
whenever these coverages are initiated a stock often drops. I wouldn’t read into it too much.
It’s not that bad tbh
[deleted]
Good for you!  I've only done mini fasts. And not it awhile.  From what I've read our bodies are wired to fast occasionally.
$INSD, a new 3x leveraged Pelosi ETF begins trading this week.
You are the brain.

And yeah, turns out you need food to live and function and the body doesn't ignore that.
I don’t even want to look.
DIDi and BIDU 🚀🚀🚀
Another 3 hours and I will have fasted for 60 hours for the first time. It's just fucked up how your brain tries to work against you by trying to crush your will.
I am too after the $1.1 billion in convertible notes at a 0% interest rate. Someone had a lot of confidence the price is going up
Plum bum is the place to be
BABA about to take off, Charlie Munger wasn't wrong.
They must be confident a bank charter is coming soon 😎
YOLO ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
I learned to love my Timberland boots 30 years ago. Well worth the money for anyone who spends much time outdoors.
Why can’t we have a real leader like president Camacho?

Slides in easier.
Seems like a coordinated dump now pump . I’m in
Charlie Munger’s fault.
So other markets gonna rip and we are gonna be red or fall flat?

No.  Gonna buy more puts.
Cause it‚Äôs a good stock?
I have to play - how high does SOFI go AND do I have the ape nuts to hold 10/15 calls beyond open.
What upcoming news?
Bears in absolute disarray
I agree, though I might go Service side with SLB or HAL as I‚Äôve already got RDSA and feel they‚Äôre pretty similar but Shell has more upside

Surely you are rich as shit now  it‚Äôs still up by x 10-15
Black coffee and bacon, excited to poop in a minute.
I'd be shocked in the infrastructure bill doesn't get passed by year end, which will help CHPT a lot. I'm heavy into CHPT and have high hopes.
More buys than sells

No one is selling SOFI right now with the upcoming news. Yesterday "flat" reset the stock. Time to go up!
Bloody hell mate
HYZN pre market is interesting, with the lawsuit.
Welcome home!
And you know what comes after that?! SOFI $22!!
Putting my last 4k into Chpt yolo

Can someone tell me why theres dozens of ships waiting at the docks ?

Why are the docks closed and hundreds of trucks just waiting around because the cranes are not working? we have a supply shortage and the cranes are not operating? what sort of retarded thing is this?
How is SOFI still going up?
Ruby‚Äôs haircut is so shite lol
That's the problem with tying up all your capital. You become an "investor."  *shudder*
X
I am gonna laugh my ass off if 10/15 450c actually hits.  

It almost makes no sense but it would be glorious
21.5, 10/15
Enjoying GOEV, EDU and blimey BB already.
BB. Never thought I‚Äôd say that again!
U think they‚Äôre gonna share all these wins with u?üßê
Anyone work at cloudflare $net and tell me how is this ticker keep going up? Low volume but 10 days straight i really want to jump in but it wont stop
Lmfao same I always hit the store for an olde English and some scratch off tix
Thinking about all the plays I could've made this year but didn't because my money has been 100% in GME since September 2020 makes me want to fucking vomit. Give me one last big run please.
What strike n exp, I wanna check it outs
The store where I used to live kept some for me in the walk in.  No one else would buy it.  I would walk in back and get it myself.
Going to bounce around 438 all day after open
That's what yall say every week. You ain't getting another dollar from me.
Honestly all the so called ‚Äòlocal places‚Äô scam the fuck out of foreigners. My family is from Mexico so they usually know what‚Äôs up.
Definitely, get that premium.
Aapl back to $142. No chip shortage gonna stop this bitch
AFRM still going

Only holding a bit. Tempted to add more. Wait for 150 break?
Max pain is 16. Anybody got puts?
Lol ok, I do be drinking a fuck ton of it tho, like at least 5 or 6 40s a week
Why choose to be gay?
Then you try and straddle and somehow both strikes are red and bleeding
Look at me. Look at me!!!!!! Don't sleep. Don't do that to me
Ahhhhh that will do it. Stripping didnt pay the college bills...but SOFI can!
SDC hasn‚Äôt even started. It‚Äôs ground floor level baby ü•∞
I buy puts and forget to cash out. It's a lose lose game
Andddddd thennnnnnn? SOFI to $21!!!
Not literally, I used to drink way too much of it.  Too much made me sick.  You're fine, enjoy!
Behold the power of markets
On the low side with this move. SOFI has news coming out?
Woke up out of a dead sleep.. checked account. Immediate adrenaline rush because of SOFI and now Im FREAKING PUMPED TO THE TITS!!

Fk this m8‚Ä¶I buy puts and the market goes up‚Ä¶I buy calls and the market goes down
I'm bagholding shares.  I should sell them some calls too.
in some broker you can by a 3X leveraged etf with a 2X/5X leverage, its not really a X6/X15 but still close
I‚Äôm getting $12 worth of sofi lottos at open and I‚Äôm hoping they go from 0.02 to 500.00
Lemme guess $1 is worth $1

FED SOBs raise  the fucking interest rates.  They give the elderly 5% cost of living increase on their social security like that makes things okay - what about their life‚Äôs savings being winnowed away.

I'm sure he can find a log and some rocks somewhere, throwing those around should please him. At least I won't have to listen to vegan bitching about how we should find some berries instead of eating fish and crabs.
doubt this is where we open. 

This would create a gap that's way too big to be favorable to bulls
Calls at open, baby I'm thinking a nice series of 5-min green dillys thru 1130 and we consolidate or dump.

I can never tell if these comments are jokes, or if people are actually retarded enough to take dating advice from WSB users. 

In case it‚Äôs the latter (GUH), I‚Äôll just point out that you need to know what you DON‚ÄôT want in a relationship before you get into a serious one, hence why a lifelong commitment when you‚Äôre that young is generally a bad idea.
No, still holding my 420p though. 3/4 my calls and holding shares in my boomer port

2 red flags when trying to date a girl:
 1. If they immediately start opening up to you bout personal shit. 
2. They dont have a past relationship that could be seen as good(all bad boyfriends). 

If you encounter this you can either just dip and be like no thanks(dont take advantage). Or just stick around till you get dem guts then skeddadle. By no means start a relationship with her unless you will treat her like her exes or else SHE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE THAT.

Most likely doesn't apply to all closed contracts in Q3 and due increased raw materials cost.

Edit: Also not 20% price increase on all nodes.
~20% or more on 14, 28 nm....

On 5nm and 7nm (18+ 34% of revenue)  it's actually much lower than 20%.

You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
My fidelity went from 47k to 36k and another account went from 32k to 24k.  So basically $20k lost between September 21-Oct 11

Had I kept the fidelity holdings, it would have recovered half the losses by now.  My account with $24k has been bleeding on SDC and other garbage

Happy birthday brother! May your dreams come true this year.
Seriously, damn good lesson. I sold out on Dec 24th, 2018. You know what that was? The very bottom of a 20% dip in tech stocks that are now sitting at double or triple from that point.

Push those LCID out. Wait for it to get red and to get better pricing. Do a calculation of what your money gives you. Dollars of premium / delta, and then check the break even price (BEP) that results for each. Then decide if you want lower total gains but more likelihood of gains (lower strike), or more total gains but less likelihood of gains (higher strike). That will lead you to the correct strike to buy. 

Analyze that over a few of the expiries. Often you can get an extra 0-3mo for barely any premium cost. Excellent deal. 

SDC is a pump. Just get out when it‚Äôs green if you can. Consider today you‚Äôre starting basis so you don‚Äôt fall victim to sunk cast fallacy.

Actually went through this a few years ago. Cost me about $3k after the implant. The one that broke is right next to the implant.  Damn this manly jaw of mine!
Right but it also didn‚Äôt happen for some months so you can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs just options expiration. Why didn‚Äôt it happen like that for last 5 years though? Look at what was going on in the market and the news during all those times. Obviously the news tries to fit events to explain what‚Äôs already happening in the market but you can see there are changes in the fundamentals that coincide with all those drops. Particularly related to 10 year rates, inflation, CPI, and fed announcements / reactions. 

DIS does look nice too. I‚Äôm actually playing SPX not SPY cuz there‚Äôs a pretty nice tax advantage for options on futures. As a result I haven‚Äôt been playing individual stocks for the most part

Oh that‚Äôs what you meant. Honestly dude technical aspects like options expiry to have an effect since they create a lot of volume but real movement is caused by fundamentals. If it was that easy that every 19th SPY moves a lot you would be seeing this pattern happen every month since the beginning of the stock market.

If you had that window, the future would change to the opposite of what you did with what you saw.
Sometimes I‚Äôd do 2 or 3 DTE ones after a very red day with a high VIX spike but on a regular basis I think it‚Äôs too risky cuz on regular days you can‚Äôt make meaningful premium on strikes that are too OTM and there can be a sudden drop any day. When the expiration is further away there‚Äôs time to come back up but you can also close the spread after you‚Äôve received most of the theta decay. On r/thetagang 30-45 DTE is recommended because that‚Äôs the optimal point to capture the most theta decay.

I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

Like I respect your opinion but you‚Äôre wrong
imagine persecuting someone for something they said, but then you find out that they were speaking in tongues, specifically your tongue, i guess in that totally fictional scenario you would have to persecute yourself at least as hard and for as long as you persecuted them, otherwise you‚Äôd be a worthless evil piece of hypocritical shit, non?
At least 2
I realize you‚Äôre being rhetorical but‚Ä¶exceedingly stupid.

Just look at bullshit like AFRM. Literally printing money while absolute dip shits who should have no business using credit can snatch up the latest trash they don‚Äôt need from Walmart and pay it back over a 6 month period‚Ä¶.

So‚Ä¶ calls then?
Ya I don‚Äôt care dude. Nor can you read, which is evident in multiple posts. I said 100k trade sizes not 100k gains. I crossed that threshold long ago. 


Do you also want to compare home ownership stats? Taxable income? Spouses? Inheritance? Jobs? Debt? Cars? Penises?


You‚Äôre like the hot head who rages being cut off in traffic, steps out and wants to fight. 


You‚Äôre a clown. 

You were shown ops calc website by another user and educated and said thanks because you know no better. You believe that because in the past, a call option had a premium, that now if the underlying meets that same price that the call premium will magically return to the premium in the past. Lol. 


You post you will get a 10 bagger but don‚Äôt disclose via what premium you anticipate that at. Is 4k or 3k gain your ten bagger? So you‚Äôre betting $300-400? Wow. So huge. 


You don‚Äôt understand delta or theta. You don‚Äôt understand how the underlying effects. You don‚Äôt understand opex is Friday. 


 You‚Äôre like the guy that gets swindled into an 80k civic at the dealership because all you focus on is the monthly payment. ‚ÄúI just need 3k bro!‚Äù Deluded. 


When someone tries to explain. Why you‚Äôre stupid you go rage and say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs compare dicks bro cmon pussy take your dick out and let me see your dick!!!‚Äù

They could've started tapering long ago, and been ready for rate hikes. But instead they just wanted to goose the market for a full year. After thinking long on it, I believe primarily motivated by political reasons so that Powell could keep his seat

Bulls gone have to switch from .29c rames to .05c powedered eggs
The 100 day moving average is an important line a lot of people watch. The market rarely stays below it, but we've been below it a lot the last few weeks. The high points SPY hit today and went back down from was basically at that line. Now we're moving above it overnight. It's shady because it could be a fake rally, or a real rally that I can't play right now. Either way it's annoying.

I have this in my long term account. Looks like I made a mistake getting some at $25 in my gambling account. Fuck this, I am out. This thing is definitely not short term.
Twitter is the future, it's not going anywhere anytime soon. It's currently priced less than DoorDash and downside is extremely limited at these levels for a tech/social/media company older than some people in this sub that will not be going away anytime soon. Just waiting for user growth to pick up and once it does this thing is going to explode. Be it this earnings or the next when that starts to happen, I'm not selling until $200. With simply improved monetization the market cap should be able to double from here alone and they have been innovating hard lately.

Well he is at risk of political persecution. It‚Äôs far more significant than risk of losing money. And he‚Äôs got a family to take care of, and it isn‚Äôt worth giving up his family and livelihood for a few apes that can‚Äôt move on. It‚Äôs time the apes ‚Äúevolve‚Äù and recognize that there are other investments in the world. The apes will naturally go away over time, this world is survival of the fittest.
I would be less hesitant to believe that theory if his last tweet was at June 9 - 12 but it was a whole week after that 300+ retest. He tweeted on June 19 when it was around ~200.  But hey maybe he did sell, just don‚Äôt know. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he at least heavily trimmed his position.

Risk: I die before 60 or soon after

We live in an era of fraud in America. Not just in banking, but in government, education, religion, food, even baseball... What bothers me isn't that fraud is not nice. Or that fraud is mean. 

For fifteen thousand years, fraud and short-sighted thinking have never, ever worked. Not once. Eventually, you get caught, things go south. When the hell did we forget all that? I thought we were better than this, I really did.
I travel there often. My preference is Medellin or Mexico City, but Panama uses USD and has great tax advantage.

Every play I barely put money into takes off. Most recent $500 into $NET around $112, bought more on the way up, so far up 23% on my money, but it‚Äôs peanuts
Because it came in exactly as expected.
my old army buddy moved to central america and he never came back. so cheap lol

I wouldn't bet against SOFI anymore. They seem to have a lot of support from big money now. Legit company that just needs bank charter which everyone seems to think is a lock. Rise in stock price is steady with minimal volatility
Just chill for a while and let the 20 ma cross the 100 ma. Neurotically  commentating how you're losing money everyday isn't going to make the market go down any faster.

At what premium bud 


Because a .6% incr to SPY is +$2.6 which at ~.4 delta gives you +$1 premium. You‚Äôll also lose .35 to theta during the day. But since you said open we can ignore that. 

At $1.7 now, that $1 incr is 60%, which is‚Ä¶ get this - NOT a 10 bagger!

Unironically a great play at this price.
I‚Äôm not gonna believe we‚Äôre done correcting until we close over 445 tbh

Stop upvoting you fucks, it's a serious question.

I checked out some sources, and looks like he's got 135M in long shares.

As for options, he's about 55% in puts and 45% in calls. But there's no way to know how much he paid for those and when they expire so these percentages might be off, but probably not by too much.

So wtf is his angle here? He's hedged in both directions and only a massive move down would make him famous again.

I feel like he's missing the point. It was pretty obvious to me when that all happened that Trump had talked with people beforehand who discussed new techniques and stuff to combat the virus. Trump didn't really understand what was being told to him beyond "inject disinfectant" or "kill it with light", but of course Trump can't not talk out of his ass when he's in front of a camera so he says the little bit that he felt like he understood and there ya go. Its not that he was right or wrong its his third grade level of understanding what was being told to him that's so ridiculous. On par with wanting to nuke a hurricane.

If you get assigned on a short put, you are obligated to purchase 100 shares per option at the strike price. After that you own the shares and any loss is based on the price difference between the strike and the current symbol price. 

Your max loss occurs if the stock goes to 0, which is the strike price * 100 - whatever premium you received for selling. Whatever your loss is, it isn‚Äôt realized until you sell. 

If you short a stock, you are actually betting the price will go down. You borrow a share and sell it for its current price, expecting to buy it back at a lower price and return what you borrowed. Since price is unlimited upwards your losses are unlimited. If you shorted a stock at $5 and it goes up to $10, $20, etc. you will eventually be out that amount less the $5 you shorted it at.
Just consider it borrowing tax money on margin for more gamble

Right!!??!!!
No üò§
No I guess I misread the wikipedia post
Yes, just call any brokerage you want to use and tell them you want to turn your 401k into a self directed rollover IRA. A few pieces of paper, most likely online, and they will do the rest. Have your 401k info like account number etc.

I used vanguard. 

Protip‚Ä¶. Short term calls in a retirement fund are very dumb. You can‚Äôt just put more money in because of contribution limits. Shares and Leaps please and selling options conservatively.

Yeah. I bought puts on BABA as well at its top and it went right up. AH.

I sold CCs on all the shares for $30 for January. I‚Äôm bullish but I don‚Äôt see how we get there with one more earnings and a bank charter. Even with huge user growth EPS may still be negative and while I wouldn‚Äôt care about that, the street will.

Back from a 3 day Reddit ban. I was making fun of a boomer on this sub that was bragging about being an ape who had once received dividends from his GME position‚Ä¶.lmao. He got his boomer fee-fees hurt and reported me to the admins for saying mean words
I was just telling a co worker about how much im going to make with these spy options thanks to our bonus this year.

He was like daq fuck? 

So i started jacking off and yelling to the moon /s (a paraody)
I rock old Chanel. I'm high as hell.
Keep buying $WISH hoping it will pop up ‚Ä¶.
Why doesn't he come here and post it himself lmao
Yeah and massive buy ins giving them time to exit. Greedy though
Man, any one getting ear BO from constantly wearing headsets during work from home?

My shits sweating and it smelss like funny beans.
Yeah, ad hominem is unnecessary, certainly; but that‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be a dick‚Äù moratorium than a moratorium on politics. 

Also, it‚Äôs legitimately hard to discuss Chinese ADRs, for example, without someone ranting about CoMmUnIsM and accusing you of being a tankie for investing anywhere outside the US.
Lmao. It won‚Äôt happen, but god dammit that would be hilarious if they did.

I'm not holding puts but yeah the markets not looking so great. If this was any other year, we'd have dropped into a correction. I think the only reason we haven't is cause most people who bought the covid dip are still green and are still holding.

Well I assume OP was exaggerating and I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs not a dose of bureaucracy to blame for an extreme like that, but the way OP seemed to ask why they can‚Äôt just hire him off the street and consider the consequences later was the main reason I was giving my input. Pretty much any corporate decision is first and foremost looked at from a liability standpoint, and it‚Äôs not as black and white as simply being a fire at will state so therefore we need to have no standards in place before we associate our company with an individual who we just met.

I‚Äôm think some deep OtM options like $850 calls would be good. They could blast up 5% easily by then or even hit $900 if it‚Äôs really good. I think the news of them delivering more cars a few weeks back is a good sign they‚Äôre gonna blow out earnings.

Possible NET strategy. When it pulls back, plot the Fib starting on Sep 30, the day when its current 10 day rally began. Buy puts before it hits Fib support. Sell the puts when it hits Fib support then buy calls. I'd probably sell the calls if it reaches the top of the Fib plot.

I 100% thought that, yes.
Well damn. I accidentally sold my 19.5 SOFI call instead of doubling down.

I mean if it runs hard off the bank charter news and somehow gets to the mid-20's, he could cash those for about maybe 20k with IV and delta increases. At that point then you only need a 5 bagger the rest of the way. Either hold the play and transition to something else in the weeks before expiration.

Was bull by market open. Only bought a put for hedging
Low risk, low reward
I own my own business. And yeah, I guaran-fucking-tee you if that scenario played out there would be a deep dive into the actions of the corporate structure and they‚Äôll be very curious about why it wasn‚Äôt important to interview somebody before adding them to the corporate payroll lmaooo
who dis
Time to rally the bull parade.
Right, and that's what the guillotines are for
remember when we heard about ~~covid 19~~ evergrande... and the market rallied for a bit longer?

if I could prove that I never touched my calls would you promise not to tell another soul

what you saw
The market has retard strength
The Cramer effect is a blessing and a curse: 

%+500 first day after he pumps on show returns 

-%400 approx 4weeks later on same stocks. 

Sofi calls will work tomorrow then implosion couple weeks later for Puts
It doesn't. Qe is a liability at this point. Look at reverse repo.
Earnings run up play
Bears losing their grip. Couldn‚Äôt even take us red on FED day. Feels like storm is passing boys ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time to chase the bears back in their dens
If Cramer makes these calls print 50k I will watch him carve pumpkins with his grandchildren
Lol i dont think anyone said it but... Bers fuked lol
Work is so fun these few months. Fuck I wish there‚Äôs no sat or Sundays. These interns funny as fuck
Really hoping spy makes a big move tmrw. Don‚Äôt care which way. SPXS has its October option expiring tmrw and I‚Äôm hoping to trade a nice healthy profit on a 0DTE. My only concern is liquidity
My dad bought a lot at 14$.....
Fool-proof plan: Imma buy a bunch of stuff on Amazon so surely its stock will go up next earnings because of my purchases. Then imma buy some stock. Can't go tits up.
Damn I‚Äôm actually kinda worried about some of my puts after today
Wish i bought more calls and didnt buy the put for hedging .
Yes.   Fear it is going lower.   Fed policy, technicals, debt limit problems all seem to be stacking against the market over the next quarter.   Perhaps another top will be put in this year, but it seems much more likely to want to go sideways or worse down through the end of the year.
Perhaps $150
AMD gonna break 120
MRNA bby

Maybe. Roughly 90m shares sold short on Perez which is a bit behind. It would need charter buying + a lot of people buying deep itm calls or bots forcing delta neutral otm call buying and lots of shares purchased. Unsure

Well I ain't getting 200% for loaning my shares out lol
Not sure how many times I have to say it. TQQQ.
So is the recession over? We going back to ATH?
Maybe $100
Why do stocks switch at open i.e pre market up then down at open? Is it because of increased selling or buying at open?
I think it might hit 363 tomorrow. Thatd be a nice spot to buy some PPPPPPUUUUUUUUTTTTTSSSS

You want a serious answer besides just claiming ‚Äúcorporate incompetence‚Äù? They hire you on the spot, you end up being a psychopath and come in the next day and murder everyone in the store. The company shares some liability because they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to have a conversation with you before hiring you.

Because the sell off is over done. I mean I don't get how anyone can think that supply chain issue driven inflation is NOT transitory.

The way I think about a pump despite a 5.4% CPI number and mid Nov/Dec taper minutes release is that the gay bears who sold off probably before their release thought the CPI was gonna be 7 and Fed was gonna go back in time and Taper starting 3 weeks ago.
Spot on, I thought the smell in there was why they called it Subway.

They make it mad legally difficult to get it delivered to your house in Maine because the nearest Tesla store is in Massachusetts and Massachusetts make it almost illegal to sell cars to anyone out of state. It's fucking retarded and takes away all Tesla's credibility in my eyes now that they've had like 10 fucking years to expand into the area. And how is service not that big a deal you fucking moron? Do you plan to just buy a whole new car next time yours needs maintenance?
Cramer gave his blessing on mad money lmao
We saw CLOV gain like 10-15%, SKLZ also like 10-15%.

Berz have it rough. In order for price to go down they need to scare people into selling, which either triggers a taxable event or a loss. Who the fuck wants to pay taxes on profits from AMD shares they bought for $12? And who the fuck is gonna sell at a loss when we all know stocks only go up unless you buy dumb shit like WISH (which coincidentally is at a pretty appealing price and will probably go up) or DNUT which should've never gone public.

Anyhow FuK BeRz for being a bunch of Fearmongerz but be nice, use lube, give them a reach around.

So today Tapering gets announced for November and inflation is up and spy managed to actually stay green for once this week. Honestly I'm just confused how and why. But maybe today was just a fluke and we open red
Actually it does if you pull in and pull out for a while
H‚Äôwhat!!! Bwhaaaaaa!!! Boy ain‚Äôt right
Why? You‚Äôll still lose

I often play kang gang and get confused sometimes on which direction I want the market to go
I just worked a commercial for them.  They‚Äôre selling headsets, keyboards, gaming chairs..  peripherals
Cramer declares peak inflation, lol.
From my experience market looks forward as little as 6 months to a max of 12 months ahead. Usually it‚Äôs mixed because some people are looking nearer and some farther.

I'm all about this. Would cash my 10/22's and prime everything else I have loaded up on SOFI for the following month.
Does the market look 12 months ahead? Yup. Will tapering be over by then? Yep. Are we in the beginning of a downtrend? YUP! Are we almost at the point where 2023 rate hikes are 12 months away? Yes indeedy. Higher inflation? Mhmm. Crash? X for doubt. Slow bleed? More likely

Honestly just pick a couple companies that appeal to you and watch their tickers like you do SPY everyday. After a few months you‚Äôll have a pretty good feel for how they‚Äôll move and you should be able to play options in both directions or sell CCs or some shit. SPY is a straight gamble, especially because everyone uses near-term DTE.

Dude the market has had erectile dysfunction for the last week. Don‚Äôt count on it lmao.
Rising oil costs does not bode well for an industry that relies on cheap fuel
Actually this is how it works in the longer term but the market will initially panic due to rate hikes. I don‚Äôt think we are getting anything severe we are just going back to the normal 2% ish rates. Likely won‚Äôt be a need for anything higher. It will be spread across multiple rate hikes that will be 0.25 to 0.5% raises each time until 2023
The tapering should drive yield higher, the inflation number confirms that tapering will happen, so for the inflation number to cause the yield to drop means that bond market is pricing in a disaster.

If only. Every investment article and video when covid was starting advised so hard not to buy. They did the same with the chip shortage and cars saying "just wait a bit longer" and look at them now. It's all bullshit. It's apparent now that they only did so so they themselves could. By the time it pops, it will at worst be what it is now. Every investor is ready to pull the fucking trigger.

My uncle said inflation is good for stocks because it "inflates" the market and the numbers get bigger. I believe him.

He won't. His dog got bigger balls than him.

No because I play options
lol can't even escape "buy high sell low" ever
u forgot to mention the pay difference
What play?
I bet he eats the pussy like Pooh eats that honeypot
The scariest explanation is that the bond market which is usually a better predictor of events thinks the Fed lost control of inflation and will have to raise rates quicker and further than expected. This would crash the economy hard.
I'm gonna take the other side of the trade and sell 'em to you if I get the time

Yeah exactly china threatening for long. But china knows US army is weak now and i have a concern after US  troops withdrawn From afghan,people here dont want US army to get involved in external affairs due to expenses involved in it and thanks to trump making china more hostile than before. 

We know given two to three decades from now china will be dominating europe and asia economically. Chinese military capabilities are increasing and technological equivalent to US.

Apart from this cremlin is making move to ukraine, Russia being on China support with mutual interest, I am concerned it just how china going to take taiwan whether force or peaceful measure. There  should be no doubt china taking over taiwan and logistically china has advantage than US in china sea.

From the pimp prospective: if you think the data will be bullish, you will raise your Hoes prices,  then you spin off one hoe to another pimp to hedge

If you think the data will be bearish, you lower prices, while also picking up another hoe to hedge.

From the client perspective: if you think the market will be bullish, see that high end escort ASAP before she raises prices, and hold off fucking her if you think the data will be bearish.

Don't try Puts yet. ROKU looks super bullish as it's holding 329 support strongly which was previous resistance. Huge call flow towards the end. I expect it to hit 340 by this week. Maybe buy Puts at 340 if it looks weak.

Basically if Rivian IPO pops off then F should sky rocket. I‚Äôm gonna buy shit loads of F calls to pay my respects

I already gave my free award to DFV last night but take my updoot
They don't get data on certain stocks (if the line is flat that's a good indicator) for some reason.  I don't know what source they use for data but it is probably linked to that
This page is a joke now. It‚Äôs an easy way to loose money. I remember before the amc/gme stuff when people actually shouted moves they were planning on doing. Amc/gme was great.

He's based af but this last show was comedically sub-par.
I took September off (Cash) just to spectate and see if we were actually gonna crash. But look.. live in Los Angeles things are all the way back to normal. Economy is running at full speed from what I can see. Looks very much like pre covid. I can‚Äôt see the market crashing under these circumstances. But I do think the Stimmy gravy train and Fed printing press ending.. is gonna reduce demand. I know we‚Äôre going sideways. You‚Äôre better than me at shorter term, clearly. I look at the market from a longer, macro outlook.. I‚Äôm a terrible trader. I‚Äôve never been a good trader. But I‚Äôve been right in predicting the market almost every 3 months for the past year and a half. So that‚Äôs where I get my confidence from.. being correct on almost every trade I‚Äôve made. I only lose when I daytrade. That‚Äôs it. So I stopped
So there‚Äôs not 1 stock you think is attractive right now, really not 1

If William Shatter and George Takei still can't patch up their differences now that Willie's been to space, I will no longer have any doubt that the whole beef is just Takei being a jealous dickhead. The whole idea of it being about homophobia sounds like bullshit but the way our boy is talking about his trip to space in that little post landing interview there's no way he has any room left in his brain for hatred of gay people if he ever did. It's now or never for that beef to get squashed and I don't think it will because it was never reasonable in the first place

I always change my strategy. I've made a lot more on puts recently where I wasn't touching them for awhile.

I quadrupled my portfolio off of AAPL TSLA and NVDA that‚Äôs it. I know the market is in a bubble rn. I need to switch gears and sell options now. And I‚Äôm killing it. I know we‚Äôre going sideways. Key to becoming a great investor is to know when to make adjustments. When to play offense and when to play defense. That‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm not doubting you‚Äôve outperformed you did. My point is making money in the market is easy. It‚Äôs not difficult to outperform SPY.. if you are actively trading and actively involved in the market. That‚Äôs just my opinion. I could be wrong about it. But Kudos to you. I‚Äôm just changing strategies at the moment. And will gladly sell you any calls or puts exp 3 months out. All I‚Äôm saying
Held my SPY 433-434 call credit spread. I think it‚Äôll drop tomorrow so I can get out with at least a 50% gain. Or maybe that‚Äôs wishful thinking.

The market looked at inflation today and said "idgaf"
Considering there was no notable sell off in the past two days following some fairly big market moving news, that‚Äôs a pretty good point for some people to buy back in and we have a 1% day.
Sure. They make plane engines. They had a hard drop, due to what I believe is mostly the effects of the pandemic flatlining the airline industry, and went down to 1.50/share. They were floating around 12-13/share before the pandemic drop. I am betting that they eventually regain their stature and return to their previous price pre-pandemic. 

I am certain they will return to that price because the US government believes heavily in the company's engines for their airforce. Recently (week or two) they inked a deal for the B52s to use their engines. Their product reigns supreme. It is a matter of getting their customers to place orders again.

I am willing to buy now and wait. I see this stock as an opportunity to make a 12x investment return if it meets it's former price. I have no idea how long that will take just that it is destined to be worth what it was before the pandemic. The worst case scenario is the price floats around 4-6/share, due to the industry looking at electric, which means it's recovery is only half-met because of future sales outlook. But that is still a 4-6x multiplier worst case scenario. And I figure that worst case won't happen as electric won't come quick enough (still in a very early phase with commerical electric) to hurt their recovery. I predict we see 12/share by the end of next year.
It did. I was up 3k at one point, but I didn't sell...It went down hill from there
With such low volume and narrow range I am bullish for the next two days. Spy calls tmmrw and friday with some QQQ puts to hedge.

For some people the instability and risk of crypt toe alone isn't enough anymore.  They use exchanges so they can multiply their risk with "penis" scams and hacks.  As a bonus most crypt toe exchanges will let you hold your fiat in "tethers", which are pegged $1-to-$1 to the USD.  These tethers allow you get the inflationary risk of dollars *plus* the additional risk that tethers might turn out to be worthless.  And by "might" I mean "very likely will".
That probably means sell off tomorrow lol

IF YOU are not making money in the stock market you are literally brain dead. So saying you‚Äôre making money is like a monkey saying he throws shit at other monkeys.. Of course. This is not a surprise. You better be making fucking money. Especially in the last year. I quadrupled my portfolio. What did you do Mr?
Right on! ü§§üçë
Look at you learning.
Sounds right.
Why have VZ and T taken such giant shits lately?

Roku has peaked chips in for a put?
Man, Blackberry had potential today but nope. üôÑ

Its not?
[deleted]
Aw. Im a ape in a bull suit sir that this hits
I'm trying to learn this. I have made 500 playing with QQQ options since last week. If it wasn't for today I would have lost all those gains. I had the chance to sit out on Tuesday but I got greedy and cocky because I had a great Monday. As soon as I recouped yesterdays losses I closed and called it a day. You are right. Sometimes it's just better to sit one out and get your mind right.

Lmao
My moves for tomorrow, continue to add to my position in AT&amp;T, people are missing the fact that short term traders are crushing the stock. Oh well...for now I‚Äòm getting 8% divy for a few more quarters, then next year goes to only 4% plus free stock in Warner Media.

I remember all the conspiracy youtubers were making videos about the inevitable stagflation and how the fed wants inflation to run hot so the media/public cries out about it and thats the only way they can truly raise interest rates without causing an economic meltdown. I laughed at the tinfoil-hat clowns but... maybe they right. Either way, imma just continue to sip on my $10 medium coffee.
Oh good for you, didn't know Wendy's had a coding program

You bought options after hours in the past?
I bought a bought a few before the dump and then sold. Bought more when it was going up thinking it would dump again

You got it all wrong. Billionaires and Multi Millionaires pay proportionally less in taxes because they use debt to acquire assets. For example, take a $500,000 loan against your stock portfolio at 3% fixed interest and invest that capital into rental properties. Now your rentals are cash flowing and you gradually pay off the loan against your stock portfolio with the cash flow. Now you are depreciating the rentals, you are doing everything by the books from an accounting perspective. There are many ways to do things like this.

Hopefully the index‚Äôs can go above 436/360 tomorrow. 

Anybody holding anything day to day straight up gambling. Think I‚Äôm waiting till next week this shit is setting up for something. 

Basically SANTOLI just said wall st keep the indexes where most options will get fucked.

Nothing but bad news for a while, cash gang it is until there's a great entry point. Even 400 is too much for this garbage.
If you cared about your money, you wouldn‚Äôt be here.

I just learnt the most important lesson of all: the market can remain unreasonable longer than you can remain solvent. Guys don‚Äôt do short term trading.

As a trader one of the most essential skills you need to have is to be able to ‚Äúfeel the ocean‚Äù. 

Imagine you are a surfer and are waiting for the right wave to come if suddenly there is lighting &amp; thunder over head your not gonna stay in the water waiting for waves. You gotta get out and get to safety. 

It‚Äôs the same thing here, if the market conditions aren‚Äôt good... don‚Äôt trade. Why lose $-500 when you can simply have discipline and not trade that day.
took a loss with fb, this time ill just go in on an actual bounce, back in MSFT for now

This is Magic Johnson aids
Yeah
Well I made some mistakes today and lost some money. Disappointing. I will have to be less of a total fucking idiot going forward
BABA gang to the moon!
Bers are so fuk
Ok I gave in. Bought QQQ 360C 10/15 for a good price at EOD right there. Let's pump dis bitch up tomorrow mayne. No lube
What a shitty day this is why I do drugs
Ty ty
Likely selling my calls at open cause I'm just a giant scared baby
Never
#SUCK DEEZ NUTS
You are the pump and dump king
My calls are up 1% on the day üêª are fucked
Awww how adorable ü•∞ All the people trying to pump the market up or down with their crazy bat shit theories. Listen to me very carefully. The money in this market is to be made selling options NOT buying them. We are going straight sideways for 6 months. Not because it reflects the economy or any shit like that.. HFs and company can pin SPY at 435 EASY.. they know no new money is coming in.. so they just gotta do what they do best and that‚Äôs manipulate. This market was bought and sold a long long time ago.. retail investors are the parasites that think they‚Äôre whales.. get a grip. Get a mf grip üêëüç≠
This is the same shit that happened last week. Tomorrow might rip to 440
Told you not to keep all your nuts in one basket
SPY $440c gonna print this week?
I can't do condors.  It's constant stress for me.
I don't stand for the gay anthem

That's utter nonsense. I've said since before he declared as a candidate that I didn't want to see him in office but it was good that he was forcing the other candidates to talk about things they didn't want to talk about.
By your thesis, we are the only country in the world having supply chain issues, and it's because of Trump, which is ludicrous.
He imposed tariffs on certain imports, and the Chinese did the same. Trump also imposed tariffs on certain other imports from other countries, but you choose to focus on China. The tariffs he imposed didn't stop the flow of anything (microprocessors, for example), but increased the cost for American companies who chose to purchase Chinese steel, microprocessors, and other imports instead of buying American.
There was no trade disruptions and no supply chain issues then. The issues developed as economies reopened and manufacturing picked back up, because China wasn't done with their lockdowns, the factories were still idle, and whatever supply they had available was used up. Now the whole world is playing catchup, and production in China is still lagging for the same reasons it is here, labor and supply chain issues. On top of that, China is currently experiencing energy shortages, which further disrupt production and export.
AND as recently as a few weeks ago, they're still having lockdowns over there to quell localized covid outbreaks. The one a few weeks ago closed their largest port. Nothing in or out for two weeks.
And you maintain all this is Trump's fault. You truly are ignorant.

Personally, i  think that first sentence there is as close to the truth as you can get. The ritual linked there is the duct tape of spooky defense. Itll work. No matter what the explanation is, ghosts or sleep deprivation or aliens or carbon monoxide, itll fuckin work. Actually it wont work if its carbon monoxide. Like it definitely 100% will not work if its carbon monoxide. Check your CO detector. 

Assuming its not CO. Do that shit twice a day. Morning and night until you feel better. And you will.

Oh the socialist is experiencing paranormal stuff? What happened, is the ghost of Karl Marx haunting you? Just tell him what you told me about college and healthcare and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll leave you alone.
So a week or so ago, I posted a story on here about a shadow creature I seen while playing basketball that day. 

Yesterday, I'm brushing my teeth in the bathroom, right? And we have clothes on the back of our door and I see the sleeve of my shirt clearly lift up into the air and then just plop down. Definitely not wind or the AC or anything.

Then today, I'm sitting here watching a youtube video after my gf left for the store and I start hearing random heavy breathing (loud as fuck) sporadically. Wasn't my video and not sure what it was, but it sounded like someone taking a deep breath in. I even called out to my gf thinking she was in the other room fucking with me.

stealth correction.


This is what will happen btw
Just saying, the logic is idiotic. If the whole rationale is that equities are good because bond yields are low, then you better hope they stay low. 

Which seems unlikely given the inflationary backdrop we have.
The thing is, unpaid work is often how ppl get the experience needed to get jobs. Experience trumps degrees in these fields. Apply for internships not college.
You can definitely learn some of that stuff on your own. The experience of working on team projects is very valuable though imo.
This explains all the ghey sex you‚Äôve been having

CPI data will dictate the direction of this market tomorrow. If it surprises to the upside, go short. If it surprises to the downside, go long. If it meets expectations, coin toss.
I used to help my boi pin test into his asscheek because he was scared of needles and needed someone to do it. He was a star football player in HS and thought he needed the roids to make it to a D1 scholarship. He ended up only making D2 and he lost his drive for the game since he had NFL ambitions. Dropped out and works as a AC mechanic now.   I‚Äôm not sure what the lesson in this story is, or if there is even a point. Just needed to get it off my chest. Also I never grabbed the cheek so that means I was just a good homie not homo right?
So youre making fun of people saying they're fucked or you actually think they're fucked

you ever get frustrated with the annoying habit of brushing your teeth twice a day, to waning feeling of satisfaction, so you force yourself to stop completely to get adjust, like quitting opiates cold turkey, and you get used to your teeth feeling like the slippery surface of rocks in the ocean in your mouth, and then slowly build your habit back up to brushing your teeth once every few days, then twice every three days--the optimal frequency? by optimal i mean the balance of how chunky the surface of your teeth gets before your next brush with how satisfied you feel after a brush.

The wealthy paying more in taxes just because you want them to (and other snowflakes) is a socialist approach. Just because the majority of people get together and don't like that they're broke or does not have anywhere near the amount that the wealthy does and want them to pay more taxes, yes, that's a socialist system right there

Hey how'd you know?
Maybe in med/law school 95%+ of people are busting their asses trying to succeed, but not even 95% of people attending college graduate college so I don‚Äôt really understand how you arrived at the conclusion that they‚Äôre busting their ass. College has only gotten easier over the years, the curriculum is constantly being dumbed down because too many unimpressive people attend. The colleges aren‚Äôt just going to fail everyone, so they make the curriculums easier and easier so they can keep getting paid.

Why the fuck would we make college free? It‚Äôs bad enough how many people are going to college now‚Ä¶ college is already free for the people who belong there. If you got straight As in highschool took AP classes and applied for all the private scholarships, you get a full ride. College is mostly just a place young people go to hangout and meet the opposite sex, and as a result the curriculum has suffered which hurts the students who actually belong there because they‚Äôre smart and hardworking. 

Universal healthcare will just result in a two tiered system like public/private education. The rich will go to private hospitals that don‚Äôt accept insurance, with 0 wait times, while everyone else is stuffed into a shitty government hospital with homeless people and illegal aliens all treated the same as the middle class workers.

The guy is conflating every single issue that he addresses. 

For example, saying that invermectin is OK to use in humans if factually correct, since it has been and is still used to treat parasitic infections at small doses. 

However, that ignores the whole issue. The issue is not whether the drug is safe to be used for a specific issue under medical supervision. The issue is people self medicating with it to treat covid, for which it does nothing, and also they end up harming or killing themselves because they overdose due to ignorance.

Therefore, conflating the two while pretending to address the issue at hand is ignorant and disingenuous at best, but given that he is a smart guy (hey, another 'fact') then it can only be determined that he has malicious intent. Ergo, he is a fucking clown.

Every single thing in those tweets is misrepresenting facts. He is taking everything out of context and bending it to suit his backwards agenda. Yeah, he is right that trump never said to inject bleach. It's because he actually said to inject disinfectant. Yet Burry is conveniently sidestepping that.

Cant be bothered to point out more of his bullshit. Keep your blinkers on if you like.
Need help...New to trading stocks..dumb question probly but...,why do some stocks go up  after trading closes and before they open the next day?

Some stocks move around in Funding the future before they fall when the price gets too high (Cathie wood stocks); some stocks are based on brand and acknowledgment of the past (Hertz AMC and Gamestop); I think TDOC had its day in the sun with pre covid and only a little bit after covid which I find hilarious, If its not going to go up with a fucking pandemic then when will it, on a random Tuesday probably but will probably only reward the Buffet types. According to sentiment I would be telling you to sell Biotech because generally biotech is almost all "overvalued" but that also fell hard and now its an opportunity to buy.

Run by modern day visionaries.
America was founded on the idea that democracy needed to be checked because people are irrational and could use the democratic process to infringe on other citizens rights. The system you‚Äôre describing of majority rule is more European parliamentarian style democracy than US democracy. But that is the direction our country is headed, because of people like you, unfortunately. 50 states would provide the most options for people so we could figure out what systems would work best, then other states could copy the states that do well. Having the fed do everything is stupid, it limits choices.

I swear these are things you just got to see for yourself to see how stupid people are
You realize wage growth is causing some of the inflation right?
&gt;Okay. So let the states decide if they want to have a state run healthcare system, and you can live in the state that has state run healthcare and I‚Äôll live in the state that doesn't.

Why should this be a state's rights issue? Seems to me that things would be much easier logistically if it were federal. Also, seems a bit shit to cuck someone out of healthcare if they aren't physically, emotionally, or financially able to move.

&gt;The programs don‚Äôt have to disappear they just shouldn‚Äôt be provided by the federal government because people who don‚Äôt support those ideas cannot escape them.

States should rarely have the right to decide anything. Almost all decisions should be made at a federal level unless there's a valid reason to not do so ("some people don't want it" doesn't count.)

America is a democracy. If the majority votes for something, that's how it should be, case closed.

As a dentist $SDC is not a squeeze play for me. I have been invested for a very long time, and I‚Äôve continuously added to my long term portfolio.  This is my retirement stock.  Short term target is $25+.  But I definitely think in the next 5-10 years they will be +$100‚Äôs.

As a dentist, I have a direct insight in how $sdc is doing in the market, as I offer sdc at all my dental offices, and I‚Äôve seen nothing but positive feedback from all my patients and their results.  You might ask yourself why I would support sdc if they are eating off my plate? 

Up to January 2020 Invisalign had a patent that they were the only ones allowed to work directly with dentists. As that expired, $sdc have signed up with over 1,800 dental offices only in the US!  This is a mutual  beneficial relationship as these patients that are referred to us dentist needs dental work and treatments prior to getting $sdc.

$SDC has a strategic growth, which is why they have partnered with CVS, Walmart and other big retailers. And further expanded internationally.

Their growth is in its infant stage, and this is just the beginning.  Hedgefunds are unfortunately unaware of what they have shorted, and now are stuck trying to find a way to close their shorts by manipulating the stock.  They will be squeezed to oblivion sooner or later. Just sit back and enjoy the ride ü•Ç

The ‚Äú1%‚Äù is a meaningless category. There is a world of difference between a surgeon who makes $600k a year (and pays plenty of that in taxes) and a Bezos or Cuckerberg. The latter pays relatively little in taxes since their wealth doesn‚Äôt come from ‚Äúincome.‚Äù It‚Äôs neither fair nor does it even make sense to lump them all together. In short, well off people pay plenty of taxes. The truly rich and powerful do not.
Me too! Lol together we will be the last bull standing!
The market always dips on the 17th-ish of every month. This dip was just prolonged. And for that reason, I drink
You gonna live to the year 2098?
Inflation will drive people to invest in assets to protect their wealth. Stocks are just going to keep going up. Shortages don't matter, China don't matter. Shit only goes up. It's just monopoly money and gambling after all.

Sounds like a solid plan
Okay. So let the states decide if they want to have a state run healthcare system, and you can live in the state that has state run healthcare and I‚Äôll live in the state that doesn‚Äôt. The programs don‚Äôt have to disappear they just shouldn‚Äôt be provided by the federal government because people who don‚Äôt support those ideas cannot escape them.

Tariffs/policies from previous admin, the stupidness of not removing from current admin, preventing more circulation of oil by being bullied by big oil (this one is 100% true).

Consider them marked.
I don't disagree. So two other options are they expect demand to drop dramatically across the board for some reason, or they intentionally want prices high because they think it benefits them somehow, possibly by virtue of making steel more expensive in rival countries. Since the US has heavy steel industry and is investing in even more, the second seems unlikely. Or there could be something completely different we are missing. What do you think?

They'll make the trillion dollar coin and eveything will continue on as normal. The market will rise with inflation (eventually) so objectively, things will probably be bullish. The country could literally be a nuclear wasteland and the stonks would just keep going up in the long term.

Unemployment should exist, but could be handled better. Foreign aid? Sure, cut it significantly.

TDOC is worth $20 Billion and its Revenue is 1.6B and it is currently losing money while diluting shareholders. While I do believe in a future of "Remote" everything, the price is just too high for some investors, especially things that can be easily replicated.

They could manage with 500b, a few years ago that was there budget. That leaves 500b for other federal spending and the states can obviously spend money that they have as well. Certain states could increase taxes because federal taxes would be lower and offer all of the same social programs the fed currently offers to all 50 states, to their state only.

Yeah I don‚Äôt doubt the ccp would tell some business secretly to do / not do something or else but there is huge steel demand from other sectors in China but also throughout the world which is why steel prices are my high. Imo this would hurt the other sectors in their own economy even more. I would think the government has an interest in getting steel prices to be normal again for the other sectors in their economy but lowering the demand by privately telling property developers to stop while also lowering the supply would just keep steel prices the same and the other economic sectors would continue to be hurt
What you just described is you spending money on yourself, in the best way possible. Nobody can spend *your* money better than *you*. If you ask me how to spend your money, it‚Äôs going to be different than how you want to spend your own money.

On March 12, 2034, US Navy Commodore Sarah Hunt is on the bridge of her flagship, the guided missile destroyer USS John Paul Jones, conducting a routine freedom of navigation patrol in the South China Sea when her ship detects an unflagged trawler in clear distress, smoke billowing from its bridge. On that same day, US Marine aviator Major Chris "Wedge" Mitchell is flying an F35E Lightning over the Strait of Hormuz, testing a new stealth technology as he flirts with Iranian airspace. By the end of that day, Wedge will be an Iranian prisoner, and Sarah Hunt's destroyer will lie at the bottom of the sea, sunk by the Chinese Navy. Iran and China have clearly coordinated their moves, which involve the use of powerful new forms of cyber weaponry that render US ships and planes defenseless. In a single day, America's faith in its military's strategic pre-eminence is in tatters. A new, terrifying era is at hand.

I don't know, maybe they are going to flat out but privately tell developers to greatly reduce property development and the requested reduction in steel output is to prevent a massive surplus when far fewer orders for steel show up this winter.

Not to say it can‚Äôt result in a big movement in stock prices but it‚Äôs basically impossible for the CPI number itself to gonna cause a circuit breaker crash.

Actually it would have been easy if everyone brought their shoes and threw at glasses. Idk why nobody thought about that
It won't be and there are number of people that's all they do is try to estimate what it's going to be.

We all know commodities are red fucking hot.  Some 100%+ of pre-covid.

But inflation lags input prices because you can't actually raise consumer products by 100% and pass it all onto them.  So instead inflation just keeps being irritating for many years, and companies eat a substantial portion of it via shitty earnings for that period.

You‚Äôre making up sensationalized scenarios in your head. There is no business that is forced to ensure all their employees are vaccinated. There is no law in any state that says this. Period. End of discussion

Every business that has chosen to require vaccines has done so out of their own free will. The federal government as an employee is also free to decide if they want to require their employees to have vaccines. If we had a different president then sure the federal government may have chosen not to require vaccines but that‚Äôs the whole point, as an employer they are free to choose. Vaccination status is not an employment class that is constitutionally protected like race, age, or gender. Furthermore every employer is free to choose what types of business they want to do business with. This federal government has chosen only to give contracts to other business that have vaccinated employees because they don‚Äôt want their employees to have to risk being exposed to unvaccinated people.

Now maybe those other businesses don‚Äôt want to have vaccine mandates but they are FREE to not do business with the federal government. The ones that chose to have vaccination requirements decided the money from gov contracts was worth more than their beliefs. It‚Äôs the free market at play. If you don‚Äôt like that then you‚Äôre free to be poor too

If you call that winning, I don' know what to tell you.

Idk how good hiv treatment was when magic was playing but tbf today when treated early the risk of transmitting hiv from blood to blood contact is really low. Pretty much insignificant from saliva. The risk of transmitting covid is extremely high from just breathing in close quarters with someone.

I‚Äôm starting over.
thats what it seems, but theres a few posts on the top of r/all talking about how HIV isn't transmitted by air so its different?

Yes I belive forcing a business to make a vaccine a condition of employment is inherently immoral. You only agree with it because your freedom hasn't been taken. The more society accepts this the closer to one day losing your freedoms we will come. This is more about the philosophical importance of individual liberties, the vaccine isn't a big deal but acknowledging that government has that power is a large precipice for society to venture down

Don‚Äôt be an idiot. Do you think the federal vaccine mandate means ever single citizen has to get a vaccine? Learn how to read.

And by your own definition you don‚Äôt think they want to keep calls from printing either? üôÑ
The illusion can be kept going for a long time.  They don't care about earnings.  They don't care about global sales.

2019 they were really fucking close to blowing up and going bankrupt but they made it happen.  People love this underdog story and another crisis like this might bring in even more capital.

Just to be clear, the concept of TSLA raking in excess margins over time compared to other automakers is completely absurd and defies 100 years of economic history in the auto industry.  But when investors don't actually care that you turn a profit, you can do lots of stupid things to grow that make it seem like you're "winning".

Edit: TSLA is not the Google, FB, MSFT of car companies.  They can't command and will fail to caputre near monopoly profits.

It wasn't some boomer selling hudreds of thousands of puts to him, it was a market maker at Sachs or some huge firm who has to pay up if it goes south. I'd think they would rather pour cash into TSLA shares if it starts to tank rather than giving Burry a ten bagger

Actually Powell did speak on that subject and suggested the reduction would be down to 0 by mid 2022, which would suggest a pace of 15 or 20.

Yeah it fluctuates a lot, but it's been on an upward trajectory all year. This isn't transitory. These costs which are some of the highest in the consumer basket should be accounted for. Core pce is used to take out volatile things such as food and energy. These prices aren't a short term rise. It's a consistent rise and everyone knows it.

bruh he is a bear, all they do is suck dick

Why are you surprised?
Anything said by a person with a large following that is immediately blitzkrieged by the legacy media is a surefire test that it is 100% accurate

Tomorrow‚Äôs FOMC minutes are one of the few times I‚Äôd say the minutes actually matter. Usually there isn‚Äôt a movement based on the minutes because the press conference already has happened and there‚Äôs no new information. Tomorrow though could give us a clue on how fast the fed is thinking about tapering. We know they are going to start in November as jpow basically said, but we don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs gonna be a 10 billion per month reduction or 15 or 20, etc. These minutes may shine light on that

Energy and food fluctuates a lot. Competition is great at deflation. Wage inflation however will most likely stick but will probably stay stagnant for decades after.
To add onto my other point.  He made another important miscalculation.

Unlike the housing market, no matter how fervent one group of investors are, they cannot prop up the whole thing up themselves.

Cultists could theoretically prop up TSLA for years.  Musk could hemorrhage cash with stupid BTCo!n bets, dilute shares, and people will think they're investing in Mars.

It's a bull signal.  Burry comes back for bearish period.  Then starts to have breakdowns on Twitter as bull signals build.  He usually makes it a week or so into a true bull market before deleting Twitter again.

Yes you inbred incel breathe. You think you‚Äôre being contrarian for saying fuck your puts. I‚Äôm telling you that you‚Äôre a stupid fucking idiot.

If bears win tomorrow, I will wholeheartedly just want to say congrats. You guys deserve to make money
Lol looks like Lloyd Christmas
I'd be down to be a üåàüêª more if the leader of the bears wasn't such a loser cuckboi

Ur gey.
I buy SPY puts every time Burry tweets like crazy and it never failed me. He literally signals when to buy puts.
Lol I‚Äôm holding 100 of  WISH 7c 12/17 rn . Kill me

Burry hoarding ivermectin, puts on sick horses
There ARE more than two genders. You‚Äôre referring to sex.
Unless he keeps rolling them
Burry the type of guy to buy puts on his marriage
Yes
My grandfather used to smoke crack, and it is what ultimately contributed to his passing in 1975. Both my mom and dad's side of the family have warned me about drugs and other addictive substances. Because of this, I've never smoked, done any type of drug, and I eat healthy foods and exercise every day. And none of that matters, because I find myself here most of the day looking for options plays to grow my $9.72 RH account, much like a crack addict looking for crack.
What if they were salami sized arreolas?
I‚Äôm so sad I missed the burry drama

Burry?

Poor Burry musta finally read TSLAs 10-Q. Shoulda done his DD.
Typhoon is hitting here in Taiwan. I‚Äôve been stuck inside for days because the street is like a river. I just want some fucking McDonalds.
Nah he meant 15 minutes. You can check his comment history. Man committed temporary suicide.
Only need a 100k bagger to get my port back on track nbd
Tesla calls are stupid expensive now anyways.  The 10 bagger days are gone.
For real though, buying a house was one of the best moves I‚Äôve made. Bought our first home last year. Went from 3600 a month in rent to 1k mortgage and 1k taxes a month. Home value has increased 25% in the year. It‚Äôs never really a bad idea especially with these insanely low rates.  Just make sure that whatever you buy, it‚Äôs desirable as far as house and location so you can either sell/rent if you do get an offer in another city or move for whatever reason. Also, put enough down to avoid pmi and expect to spend 10-20k after you get the house getting things fixed up. Homes are expensive and there‚Äôs a lot of shit that can come up, especially if you buy a hundred year old house like we did.

Anyone who has been in the market for over 2 years and isn‚Äôt a complete fucking idiot could tell how obvious it was to be holding puts right now. If not loaded with puts at least some sort of hedging. Not buying puts when smart money is makes you a contrarian dickhead.
Even if they are he‚Äôs doing just fine. Tsla call holders get one -5% day they are in fact financially ruined.
Rofl you don‚Äôt have to be popular to win
Burry should cage fight a Tesla roadster to settle this dispute like man
it‚Äôs trading?
Burry prob closed his Tesla put already.
Booby trap.

I meant more of his tweets. Dude seems like an angry uncle.
How in the fuck do you interpret this as attempting to be ‚Äúdeep‚Äù lmao you‚Äôre dumb as bricks my dude
His puts have to be absolutely wrecked by now.  Unless he cashed out last month.
When is inflation going to hit my portfolio?
Scion Asset Management underwater. Answer the phone Michael!
Oil moves so goddamn slow on the way up but takes an elevator on its way down. It‚Äôs hard af to trade because it‚Äôs so manipulated and so many variables are at play. Im still hoping for $90 a barrel by January but we‚Äôll see.
Probably take profits tomorrow. I'm in take profit/loss quick mode.
Thank you. That‚Äôs kinda where I was leaning. Might just might just do an ATM straddle.

Did I tease your bf too hard? ü•∫
HOOD earnings are gonna be terrible. This sucker is going to 30s, then I‚Äôll fire off some short puts
Burry will eventually be right about TSLA as they become just another player vs huge global competition, but the market could remain irrational far longer than his puts expiry date
That's what I'm wondering
because of a typhoon apparently
Its equal to four months of FED QE as well.....
Unfortunate. Thanks
Not the point , it was just how random it was and from burry of all people. He‚Äôs known to be extremely lowkey
Phone on it‚Äôs last leg?
Well my cost basis is $5.37 for 9,175 shares. Just give me $10 and I‚Äôll be stoked
He‚Äôs probably right about all those things but like last time his timing is off

You see, I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never *usually* a contrarian dickhead. I hate to do it *usually*‚Äù

It‚Äôs *tricky*, but if you pay attention to the context (remember your context clues!) you can guess that if I say I‚Äôm not *usually* a contrarian dickhead, it means that *sometimes* I am!

And since my next sentence 

#‚Äùfuk ur puts‚Äù

Is talking about the puts *you currently have*, we can assume that I‚Äôm probably being a contrarian dickhead *now*!

This has been said about every round number from at least 15 down to 5, and was probably said about all the ones from 30+ down to 15
Everyone in here will go crazy. They will call bs and blame the feds for "cooking" the numbers
What was it like in 1929 old fella?
Lol if it were something like SPY puts then he woulda been, but he actually diagnosed the root cause and bet against it using credit default swaps.. I think he thinks he's also a genius in other shit he tweets about which he definitely ain't.
Fuck me, should have suspected as soon as you retards were screeching about Oil Monday morning. Literally gave away all its gains from being up like 3.5% in premarket yesterday. Literally just inverse this place. BABA is gonna get screwed next üòÇ

I'm from the area originally. Be aware of state taxes, MD is quite high. 

In general housing doesn't appreciate super fast there like hot areas in the south, for example.

Also housing is at all time high in inflation adjusted terms, above the 2008 bubble. It's not likely to crash, but I wouldn't expect big gains in the next few years. If inflation persist and fed doesn't fight it, housing is the place to be though.

But if you can own cheaper then renting, can be worthwhile. You may find you don't want to stay long term, so taxes/fees on buying/selling make it not worthwhile without either keeping as rental or staying for a few years.
Nice
It'll only be forever

I remember you. If you can afford it, buy some real estate now. You could consider a townhome or condo if you want that you could rent out later. Or a single family home too.

They're OK. By the time you're out in Clarksburg, it's pretty rural, but still not that far in to DC. Rockville is kinda... meh, but once you get further out from there I kinda like it. I live in the VA suburbs myself, but get out 270 fairly often. I don't know where you live now, or what kind of housing, but I'm sure you can find something suitable out that way.

But I am a single dude 26 yrs old making 110k base salary, moving DC in Maryland side. according to my tax brackets, I will be paying 33% tax, so I am thinking of buying a house to save some money on rent and getting something valuable asset too. The issue is I am not sure of staying in that area for long term, I dont know, it all depends on my future wife, other job offers and how I like that area, which I dont have any idea right now.

You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
Those are my thoughts exactly. The only thing is that if it were so obvious, it would have already been priced in. I really think inflation data is going to be bad tomorrow, but will it drag down the market? We'll have to see.

You don‚Äôt need a script for meth.. pretty much the same
Yeah, not sure how consensus is for .3% MoM lmao.

Only way that happens is if BLS rigs the numbers (cherry picking data, hedonistic adjustments etc)
Kids are mean. Tell her to try her best to own it. There are definitely others like her at school, she just needs to find her people. Just be there for her and remind her that she‚Äôs great the way she is. Maybe try to get into some of her interests (could feel validating if someone she looks up to likes the nerdy things she likes). Idk just spitballing here. High school is tough. Wish I had better advice.
!banbet PLTR 25 52w
That is not otc sir
I don‚Äôt believe this would happen, but wow would it be nice if Inflation came in low as shit and JPOW was like ‚Äúyou know what let‚Äôs keep supporting the recovery because inflation isn‚Äôt a worry‚Äù that sure would be fucking swell
S&amp;P 4600 was the consensus I remember from banks. Which is very possible if things go well, but also very not possible if the government keeps dicking around being retards

Welcome to the supply chain of 2021
6w &lt; 2m?!?
To stop inflation they can just change the way it is calculated. Housing prices up 25% year over year? Just calculate using some made up metric about rent equivalent payments.

Gas up 25%? Just change your preferred metric to CPI that strips out food and energy

Being an economist is easy

That movie is phenomenal. The Machinist. He dropped 63 lbs for that role. One of my favorite actors
Yeah it‚Äôs insane. COULDNT believe it
CPI does include energy &amp; food. The core inflation removes energy &amp; food and that is called the PCE.
Let me know if I missed something üëá there... Thanks

That‚Äôs some new age perspective. It doesn‚Äôt matter who you seek companionship with it‚Äôs all good. 

You don‚Äôt think there is any chance that a certain meaningful percentage of individuals that aren‚Äôt ‚Äúhot‚Äù find it easier to find companionship under the rainbow flag?

You confuse opinion on a matter with some idea that I mandate everyone believe like me.

I disagree with you and believe humans are capable of making up and justifying whatever they want. That‚Äôs not a positive attribute.

Spirits have a higher concentration of alcohol (40%) than beer (5%) or wine (12%) and are often downed quickly, either in shots or with a sweet mixer. This rapidly increases blood alcohol concentration, and therefore alcohol‚Äôs effects, including changes in mood.

Yeah. Another issue you're going to run into on the mainstream media side of it is that everybody's going to talk their book. Most money managers and professional investors have an Apple position. With that in mind they're never going to not talk it. Same for most big cap tech.
Pro tip but whenever sofi goes up at all you just buy puts and automatically make money its like vix jr
DPZ Puts are def the earnings play.
I believe natures intent was to give us the opportunity to reproduce like almost every other living organism.

My friend is my niece (15yrs old) ...  she's very smart tells me kids called her a nerd.. Any advice from ladies?
I think I‚Äôve found the solution for my options trading woes. But SPY calls or QQQ puts, or vice versa. At least 7 DTE, at or around the money. Might go tits up eventually but it makes sense in my White Claw drunken stupor right now.
If you told me on January 1 that the year's biggest gains for me would come from AMC and GME and the year's biggest losses for me would come from VZ and T i would call you retarded.

How long are you banned when you lose?
It‚Äôs operating margins is 20% which is significantly higher than many other carriers. It own physical infrastructure and consumer ISP channels via fiber connectivity. Many government contracts. . Besides that 141b in debt, but it‚Äôs cash flow is in a good position to keep those payments in hand. The sale of aol and yahoo for 5b will help pay some short term bonds that are maturing. Most of that debt is from 5G spectrum purchases. Long term once 5G is built out we should see more payments and reductions of debt. A nice dividend payment and much lower valuation then the rest of the telecom industry at 10PE vs industry average of 18. It‚Äôs well run on the management end of the business. Return on capital employed is trending in the right direction and earnings have continued to be strong.
Spent $80 on pull tabs.

I guess it's such a behemoth and cultural icon now that it's "tech without the extra risk" to a lot of people. And I know there's solid growth behind it, and buybacks, and you never know what they're going to come out with next. It just feels like its success and valuation are assumed though. Maybe because of its track record people get laughed out of the room if they pick at it. But I'd still like to see people try. I kind of think it's a negative if no one does.

Much like Goldman and Black Rock (not to mention their conflicts of interest with the CCP). They've all made recommendations to buy different Chyna equities NIO, BABA, Tencent, ect. Saying its all ready üçö in and missing special deals. This is these fucks looking to dump a load in gullible suckers imo. Classic give us the liquidity so we can get out like bandits. 

Maybe 2-3 years from now it will be a great time to buy but right now they definitely are not and Chinese equities can go much much lower. There needs to be alot more pain before this is done. However, the answer to slumping Chinese indeces is not to remove bad equities and stop trading them on exchanges. That alone should tell everyone in the west how big of a fucking scam this shit show is.
I hate this choppy market we've been in. After expirations Friday we better rally or drill, I can't make money getting whipsawed daily

The idea behind that is that Apple can trade sideways, through ups and downs, for long periods of time but over time consistently gives solid returns, so it's mainly advised for people that don't want the risk of actually trading to just buy it and hold it.

Helena Blavatsky and theosophy corrupted the old tibetan idea of the emanation body, a mental projection that a monk could make of themselves, and turned it into tulpas and thought-forms. While an argument could be made that the tibetan monks had concepts vaguely similar to tulpas and thought-forms, those terms and the specific nature of those concepts are the product of theosophy. And like much of theosophy and shit that passes for "ancient wisdom" nowadays cause people don't do the homework, the concept wasnt really expounded on until after HPB's (Hot Peanut Butter) death by Annie Besant and the pederast C.W. Ledbetter.

It's pretty wild to me how many times I've heard "you buy Apple, you don't trade it." I believe in Apple and I get it, but like, it's just a company like any other. It's not guaranteed to be amazing forever just like it's not guaranteed to have anything ever take the wind out from under its sails. There's marginal to no debate at the AAPL table. I don't think that's healthy.

Yeah. I'm sure you know that technically Uber is illegal there, but people use it anyway. Pro tip: order a couple Uber Black rides after you touch down. Do it until you find a driver you like, with an Escalade or Navigator, etc., and then use him off the books as your personal driver. You can get groceries delivered there, so big hauls get delivered. Just hit the store for random items as needed.

Longer term strategy if you think the current situation will end badly? Well. My theory is inflation will eventually require all Central banks to tighten. This will cause a world wide recession. Different than 08/09 and 00 because this recession will be driven by economic activity versus market exuberance. That means deflation will fast follow the inflation.

What to do? Get out of all debt and protect as much wealth as you can.

Or....you can try to make money off the drop. That's my strategy. (Though I am debt free as well).

Ooh, so close.
CPI is going to be ugly most likely, FOMC notes might be juicy, but I'm betting the market trades sideways, lulls everyone to sleep, then drops EOD AGAIN. And then I quit and buy the hottest growth story I can find and Uninstall all apps
I read about a case of a surgeon who would sign his initials into the organs of people he operated on. That sounds like something Burry would do. I think it was in the Uk.

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Boomalotti made a bet that SPY would go to 500.0 when it was 433.62 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Gyna open
433 will be good, but 440 any time before probably 10/25 is unrealistic. We may see it a couple days earlier, but I'm not betting on it.
Well, initial disruption was caused by him. Taxed exporrs on china and severing ties with xi jin. 

We cannot completely deny that trump had no geopolitical effects when it comes to China. Internally chinese multinational companies undergoing stringent lockdown and investigation is due to US hostile behaviors
You know when weird shit like this happens, a shitstorm is on its way.
CPI PRINT IS .8% for the month projected by Analyst with low error rate. Prob transitory.

50k a month? Tell me what ticker and ill sell em.
They probably are cutting iPhone production because they anticipate lower demand. Chip shortage is a convenient excuse. If chips were the limiting factor why would they cut iPhone production before lower margin iPad production?

Yes, I would also like to know what a ticker is.

Not COVID, but the authorities, and people's (worldwide) reaction to COVID. The response was to shut everything down and lock people in their homes, especially in China (and Taiwan) where most of the supply chain issues originate.

AAPL announced today that they couldn't deliver iPhone 13s due to supply chain issues. These are manufactured in China, with parts that come from China and Taiwan. They don't have the parts because all the semiconductor manufacturers were shut down for most of a year.

It's not a problem with shipping the finished product, it's a problem getting all the components. And it wasn't Trump that shut down China. Or America either, for that matter, that was done by the democrats.
AAPL gonna have to go USB type c and half their overpriced accessories sales are going to shit

John Deere workers are possibly going on strike and the first offer from Deere was a piece of shit offer.  Idk how this "negotiations" thing works at all.

What is my move tomorrow? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.

People are making inflation = lower stock prices way more complicated than it has to be. Inflation, by itself, doesn't mean shit for equities unless your corporation has a ton of input costs and no way to pass them off. 

What matters is bond yields. We've been worried about them for nearly 9 months now and it hasn't amounted to shit. Why? Because the rest of the world's inflation problem is waaaayyyy worse than America's. And the rest of the world is waaaaayyyy less confident in their respective economies than they are in America's. Right now we have no power crunch and all of the major economies of Eurasia do.  So what do they do?

They buy American bonds. We have clear evidence of that by just how historically low the yields still are. And because our bond prices are just as much a result of supply, demand, and expectations as anything else, American bonds cannot skyrocket unless the rest of the world's economic confidence rebounds and America's crashes. So there's a lot of reasons to be nervous, but as far as genuine reasons to fear go, we're really not there yet.
Did you miss the shift in sentiment?  Good news is bad and bad news is cause to dump and run fer dah exits. Perfectly planned.
Bulls are so used to seeing red they are normalizing -0.05% futes, pretending it‚Äôs bullish
They just want to buy FDs that print, the price of SPY doesn't matter

The issue isn‚Äôt with the price of the iPhone more so with the worry of reaching the end of the bell curve when it comes to technological advancement in a Phone form factor. If you‚Äôve noticed in the last few years every rendition of the iPhone has less and less real improvements over the previous model. People will start keeping their phones for longer before upgrading In the future, especially when the phone is like $1k. Just my guess tho

True.  Small engines are super pollutants. They could do it gradually though.  Just ban 2-stroke engines which are the worst first, etc. Doing this would affect lot of small businesses.

lol. Well, the sad reality is they are so worthless at this point there really isnt much left to lose. The only thing I would be selling is an opportunity to do some damage control. I accepted it when I bought them that this was fairly risky and would likely end up at zero. \*shrug\*

What about rekt market, is that old news too
Back in 2016 I had just gotten out of jail that same week. I was feeling kinda low and I was in the mood to be degraded. I went to an ABS I'd been to before. It was around lunch time so there were plenty of guys looking for some action on their lunch break.  
  
I got plenty of tokens and found an empty booth with a hole. I spent nearly 4 hours in that booth. I sucked on 13 different cocks. I only got to swallow 5 loads of cum because some of the guys weren't ready to cum yet. Some wanted to suck me, but I bottom only. Swallowed 5 anonymous loads, got fucked and took one load in my ass. All the time I was texting a female friend in California every time I sucked a guy or swallowed his load. She got off to what I was doing. It was one of the most erotic and degrading things I've ever done. I loved every minute of it. I went to the same place yesterday. Kind of a slow day. Only got to suck two cocks and swallowed their loads.
Im getting a little worried our supply chains are permanently fucked

Hey man I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre kidding. But as someone who‚Äôs both made and lost 6 figures in this game, don‚Äôt take the risk if you need that money. This is a zero sum game. You might win or you might lose. There is no guarantee. Don‚Äôt conflate your luck with skill which is what the majority of people get high off of. Just put that shit in an index fund and go improve your life and your skill sets instead of doing this degenerate gambling.

bad news got priced in twice in 2018
2 words for you CPI FOMC
Brilliant
Only if there's an /s at the end
Because CPI tracks inflation, and if numbers are bad people lose trust in the whole *inflation is transitory* mantra that the fed has been spewing this whole time, if people lose trust they'll start running for the hills = market goes kaput and we're going for new lows. FOMC is just the sprinkles on top of this shitcake.

Bad news gets priced in once.

Good news gets priced in twice; first with the rumor, then with the news.
Out of luck, pringles are all they want.
BP had a huge drop off when they halved their dividend at the beginning of covid, and I think they're more sold off than is reasonable. they also have massive lng exposure which is obv thru the roof right now. there's some correction coming right now for BP but there's basically a total gap between 35 and 28 that's finally getting retraced. 

I was in MRO and got out when I broke even but that one is rocketing too, lots of lng exposure
I made 10% ROI while sitting on the toilet at work today.
Sounds cool, use the profits to buy a ranch.
Jobs report was low but not low enough to warrant the fed not tapering. Not a win for SPY and fed tapering was priced in already.

CPI and FOMC have different implications to the market
Bloomberg decides to run the AAPL story right after market close, leaving just enough time for the guy whose name is on the building to buy PUTS.

Something you haven't heard (yet) is the behavioral impact that inflation has. Buyers may go "on strike" if prices go too high. Especially with the FED screaming transitory. If you had the option to wait to buy a new car...what would you do? Very recessionary.

The old saying. The solution to high prices is high prices.
They're projecting shortages well into 2022.

Everything has to go perfect for them, and everything wrong for the competition. 

They need 30 gigafactories to produce the cars investors are pricing in by 2030. 

And they need to rates to stay zero for the next 10 years.

i gonna hold shares till after merger. then start selling calls again. if we can hit 130 ill relax
Cathie bought COIN at 300 and sold at 250. Is she a retard?
it's fucking ridiculous. On eToro, if you buy Oil with x100 leverage, you literally get 1.74% interest DAILY. Fucking daily interest on that shit

Yea, the world‚Äôs biggest company is definitely not gonna find a way to close the gap after selling you 75 million phones instead of 80.
If it can go 400, why not 450? I am just saying anyone can assume anything coz anything can happen. Maybe he is little dumb enough to bet in short term, it can go maybe after a month or after an year
If you're using HOOD you're already in the hood

Not sure if puts or calls ü§î
It would be awful if retail shorted BLK (blackrock) into the dirt.
Can I buy calls on your pooty
That is the common expectation. There certainly is a rising percentage of economists saying this might stick a bit. 

Last year many thought the chip shortage in autos would go away, they haven‚Äôt. Apple with supply issues now. Does not seem to be getting better.

A friend of mine who works with imports from China said they are not taking orders right now due to energy constraints on production.

It‚Äôs a dangerous snowball effect that‚Äôs started.
Wait until Gensler announces banning payment for order flow then buy when it‚Äôs 40% down

Thoughts on girls who hate sex?
More or less  I‚Äôm a retard. Also. Back in August started buying 7DTE calls or puts in or at the money on SPY depending how I thought it would open the next morning. If I was up I‚Äôd sell them and do the same thing before close the next day. Even if they opened down most of the time I could wriggle out of them at break even at some point. Rarely went tits up. Then September happened. And like a true retard I decided that was the time to get ballsy. Lost most of my port in two days. Then I went back to the old way and went up over 100%. Then got ballsy. Rinse. Repeat. Fuck you degenerates convincing me that YOLOING my whole portfolio on 0-1 DTE calls or puts was the answer to all my problems.

you mean in terms of their performance or stock performance? banks generally tank after earnings, DAL will prolly go up.
scalped it 2 times after hours with 300 shares. 91 to 99.5 the first time,then again 91 to 94.5 lol.. depending on how it opens tomorrow, will buy stocks for long term. will be 200+ in no time

Boys what‚Äôs the next oil industry play? What‚Äôs the next big industry? We thought negative oil prices was a bad time to buy oil stocks and they went up 1000%. 

Is it REITS? REITS are still down over 100-300% since covid. Are we dumb to not buy REITs today when they‚Äôll be sky high in 2024?
what that?
Lol imagine what‚Äôs gonna happen when there‚Äôs a glut of chips again.
When you‚Äôre a boomer, your .025% gain in Unilever and Molson over the last decade is an even better story than that one time you had lights-off sex at the Best Western with your wife‚Äôs average looking sister.
Usually just make out until she starts feeling lightheaded and then I know the roofs are starting to kick in. No just kidding, but for real, Usually your bodies take over, start leaning a certain way more and more and then bam next thing ya know, pants and underwear are coming off and you're off to the races.

Gotta butter her up first. Foreplay is key. You want to tease and get her so excited she is begging for a pounding
im just saying there's a legit reason for them to go down
They sure did not lol
Never kiss girls, it puts you into that weird grey area situation you're talking about. Just go straight to sex.

Don't know what you are talking about I did exactly that and tripled my money on oil.
All growth stocks are. Unless you wanna stick your money into INTEL and watch it stagnate
The chip shortage is because manufacturers don't have enough capacity to meet demand. Because they can't meet demand, they are leaving a lot of money on the table from orders they can't fulfill. Those missed opportunities are weighing on the stocks.

#KISS HER RIGHT IN THE üÖ±Ô∏èUSSY
Worst fucking trader on this planet *so far*
U: Imagine kissing a girl for 2 hours straight but not getting any pussy

Her: Imagine kissing a guy for 2 hours straight but not getting any D. Is he a quitter? Y didn‚Äôt he keep going?‚Ä¶ etc, etc, etc. 

The *her* goes on for a while in a complaining sort of way. Either way ur fault.
Will have to try
Could happen. That stock fucks bulls and bears though. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not long anymore. That‚Äôs all I gotta say.
Maybe you‚Äôre gay?
I‚Äôm not in any but I‚Äôd buy AMD. MU is perpetual garbage and TSM has the China risk
hey back in high school I could do that and at least get a dry hump out of it.
Dude, you‚Äôre fucking gay. It‚Äôs totally cool, but just admit it to yourself now so you don‚Äôt waste 2 more hours of someone else‚Äôs life.
wrong. Go balls deep in puts
I‚Äôm the worst fucking trader on this planet
r/acorns is so fucking stupid. They're over there bragging how happy they are about their +0.7% a month; when they could be actively managing their portfolios like me and averaging a healthy -8% a week.
Remember green?
because people are noping the fuck out of SPY
Woah don't go ruining my play
No clue. Would have had a stellar day if I could take back yesterdays buys! But Im always a tad early. Also my gamble that rates would pop a bit after the bond market opened didnt pan out.

So I will watch and react. In a semi day trader mode right now. Scalp profits quickly.
Why the fuck did we not all buy oil when it went negative? Did everyone think we were not gonna use oil ever again? The fuck boys? What the fuck were we thinking

I was dating this girl and instead of breaking up with her I said let's just take a 6 week break and see if we miss each other. She said ok. 6 weeks passed and she texted me that she really missed me and that she definitely had feelings for me. I said I didn't, bye.

Bears, my friends, I feel to many of you think tomorrow will be -5%. We have a lot of bad news that will continue to come out that will push the market further. But tomorrow? During banks earnings, not gonna happen &amp; if we are red, DONT expect much. OI for puts/calls is heavy to the put side. Now remember the market likes to do the opposite of the majority or we would‚Äôve all been rich already that‚Äôs all thnx love you all
A speed bump? More like a goddamn roadblock
I'm happy wagering $1000 dollars to sell puts where I make $30. I cant make any money otherwise

If I see it pump again, I still wouldn't have the guts for yoloing into puts, but bear credit spreads are a no brainer. That ticker drives to the gym, does two bench presses, complains that it's tired and leaves.
Imagine being in the greatest chip shortage of our generation and chip stocks dropping faster than WISH. Dumb ass market
Black market will always keep legal weeds revenues down. Maybe if they levy some tax. They tax cannabis like 35% some places. Millionaires pay 35% tax now they want the average citizen to pay 35% for a plant?
I wish but its not happening. When the .gov pays people 2.2x of their pre covid wage for free for a year, they create a self worth inconsistent with reality.

I believe you're right. It was thursday afternoon, the markets took a shit, then opex was next day, and monday was also red.
Yeah the fuck are they gonna do. They‚Äôre gonna run out of money eventually, they‚Äôll have no choice that‚Äôs why inflation will be transitory IMO.

I feel like jobless figures are being boosted by people rotating out of shittier positions/companies in light of many companies offering competitive wages if you have legit experience. People know that if they stick to what they do and don't see any doors open, they can get a better paycheck/position elsewhere at the moment. 

Personally, I found a 20% raise for a less shitty, cooler job sticking to what I know, and that's in the construction biz while heading into what are always slower Winters.

Not an impossible thought but the setup today was suspect and I don‚Äôt think you can ignore the global commentary and fed commentary on inflation. Nobody said it was cooling down right now and they likely know where the number will fall already

*Wedbush Securities analysts estimate that Apple will be running short by 5 million-plus iPhone 13s for the holiday season. The analysts' note follows a report from Bloomberg that Apple would likely cut iPhone 13 targets for the year by as many as 10 million units due to chip shortages. But the analysts say this is just a supply chain timing issue and call the production issues "nothing more than a speed bump on a multi-year supercycle iPhone 12/13.‚Äú*

Imo the whole people leaving their jobs and not coming back is overrated. Like there is no way people who worked minimum wage would last long without a job. They will all go back to work within the next few months and things would start to settle down. The same is true for people who are saying vaxx mandates would cause people to leave. Majority of Americans are neck deep in debt with no savings so they will go back to work when they realize they‚Äôll end up on the streets without a job.

Ok, I guess that‚Äôd justify an 800 billion $ market cap.
37% of gold is used in electronics. Gold goes up = electronics go up. Therefore, big tech = inflation hedge üòéüòéüòé

On the real tho, it's fuckin everyday ass shit that people need that are seeing inflation (gas, housing, cars), not fuckin gold watches and wedding rings, and there's only a couple bucks worth in things like iPhones and computers. For every fintwit figurehead that keeps talking about gold getting a boost, there's a million millennials who don't care about investing in it. Society is becoming more and more of a melting pot between rich and poor, and boomers/gen x just don't see that it's not really a material to the younger gens, it's a color. It'd be really rude to ask someone not super close to you if their rings/jewelry are real gold nowadays.

AAPL theory: I was doing a lot of semi conductor research over the weekend, and I came across some information that TSM may have trouble supplying all of their customers with 3nm tech next cycle. Apple was mentioned. This would indicate that Apple would not be able to move to 3nm for the next Bionic installment and would have to stay with 5nm for another cycle. As would other customers.

I'm hypothesizing that this information that has leaked could be based on future models that were planned for 3nm - meaning it may still be business as usual for the 13...

I may roll the dice and go big on LEAPS tomorrow.

I judge whether it's a üåà trading day or üî• trading day based on number of posts from u/cashflow_ in this sub.

When it's üåà, u/cashflow_ is super active and talks about eating something other than ramen or Wendy's or buying a yacht because üåàüêªs made money.

When it üî•, u/cashflow_ is super active and talks about deleting his trading app or leaving America for Columbia because he's depressed or some shit
Apple or Tesla?

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/mahmoud_abdul-rauf made a bet that SPY would go to 428.0 when it was 434.35 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Yes there are loads of women like that.  Try being a little cockier and making sure they have fun - seems obvious but a lot of dudes focus on their night and expect the girl to just go along.  Women want attention (like everyone) so if you can make what they want to do seem like your idea, it‚Äôs a done deal
Yeah I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going through my mans head. I was talking to him trying to understand. Think he‚Äôs into some deep conspiracy shit. I kept telling him he has no proof that Pelosi bought those. But he was certain that no other sane person would buy that amount of calls. I kept trying to explain it was probably some firm with a hedge to another position‚Ä¶ then he just did the ‚Äúremind me 2 days‚Äù deal. Kind of sad it‚Äôs coming to an end, this shits entertaining af.
More than you could possibly imagine
Yup, happened to my mom.
Ok bears this is your chance. If banks can miss, you can pump oil and 10yr rates up, and FOMC says stagflation is 100% certain SPY could finally see 220 until people realize whats going on.
It was just a question.

Relax, Twitterati.
Yes it tastes like raw eggs
450 going to print anyway. Maybe not 10/15
Anyone else spend an terrible amount of time on this sub? I spend my time here more than I do at work and I spend more time on it even after work. It‚Äôs like a drug.
Sofi puts will print 100%
Imagine being so poor you don‚Äôt have your chauffeur fill up for you
Noooo I bought ZS calls then lost all that money when it dipped to $180 - I moved it to GME and BB and AMC... lost it all on a Thursday

I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of MMs across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot.

So long story short. Calls it is. You bears are idiots.
Yessir. Thats 8% of the entire float

Ever heard of shares?
Tmrw may be the biggest day in my trading career. What 0DTE spy options are gonna be best.

Anyone else have trouble holding trades? I traded a lot today. Only spy puts expiring tomorrow. I made the same trade a bunch of times and sold it everytime spy spike. If I had just held I would have made a lot of money instead I‚Äôm down 6.5k today. At my lowest, I was down 11.5k. So much pain. I just want to be rich
mad respekt to anyone who takes crackers this serious
I disagree, I went away to college at the age of 28, last thing I wanted was marriage.

As a cracker connoisseur I respect this opinion.
Lol the fuck you talking about? We‚Äôre down a combined 4 points from where spy opened Monday.
Zero, but the rocket didn‚Äôt blow up, but safely landed. Now if this rocket explodes on the next launch‚Ä¶the stock probably goes to zero.
Gotta give you a hard no on that one.

A lot of companies are having serious supply chain issues right now, not necessarily due to them but of their overseas suppliers. There's only so much they can control.

However, if there's two stocks that have been hit now, that are the two most capable of correcting it, it's NKE and AAPL. Both swing massive cocks.

You're having a bad day? Guess what? Read up on the company and what's in the works. Look at the trading. No news today, stock up five bucks in regular trade, another two, three bucks in AH. I didn't do that. Volume up most in five sessions.  


Do your own work if you want to argue my position. I'm long stock.

Commodity‚Äôs have been crashing no way
I saw u/cashflow_ at a Costco yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù
I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly

At least five US mass shootings this weekend, but most will take place in black neighborhoods and won't be reported on
So, everyone who has ever bought a weed stock did so because they expect a huge pop when the US legalizes it. This has been going on for years. American legalization isn't only priced in, it's over sold.

Combine that with an administration that doesn't seem motivated to legalize it for ANOTHER couple years and you get an entire part of the market void of enthusiasm.

Pajama trading means nada.    Apple goes down a little tomorrow then recovers.   This market is about not owning depreciating cash.
I made $12 today :)
The Fed has been buying all the bonds up, but when they stop it will cause bond prices to go down from their par value being more appealing to bond buyers, who may otherwise be using that money to buy stocks. 

I think is how that works. I may not speak the correct lingo for it though.
If that happens I'll be pissed about taking the L at the top on my December $125 puts was bagholding on the way up

What to even buy. Maybe just hold cash or buy bonds and precious minerals in this market. No stock is safe.

People are not going to sell stock because of a delay in chips.   The ones that do are foolish.   The asset does not change materially in value over a 1 time 5% hit to income.   Its value is the sum of its future cash flow which in aggregate will be the same.  Services revenue does not change at all.

The interesting thing is they're getting trapped in it. No one else wants to buy it so the liquidity is so low that they can't sell without crashing the price.
Winning strategies are about consistency and routine. That's why I line up my tendies for GME buy orders every day.
$380? Bro we're going under 200 lmfao!

Wait what‚Äôs he wrong about? You only brought up more points about Gruden, you didn‚Äôt say anything about the other people he is referring to.
Too risky. Good chance it could open green but the risk outweighs the benefit
Imploding
!banbet SPY 429.5 1d
Spy bulls are just delusional. There‚Äôs been nothing but the fed lying and bad news for months while it steadily and sometimes hastily climbed from the low 400s to 454.
I'm seeing a lot of people say CPI, does that mean invest $CPI? ^^^/s
According to the Palantards, yes. Nobody else is saying it, though.
What happened to apple? Glad I waited to buy calls for the upcoming event.
SPY and apple going to rocket tomorrow. Might have to buy some at open

Does anybody else look at old screenshots of positions when you were up like 20k and you had crazy money and you look now and you got 50 dollars in your robinhood and your actual bank account is blown up and sad and you think to yourself‚Ä¶ how did this happen?

5 isn't that much, it's when you get to 8-9 a night that causes the real problems.  
I had 5 drinks a night for about 3 years as a bartender in a dive bar.  I am in perfect health now though I do not drink much at all anymore.  
Do something in excess and if you are a sane person that actually wants to experience some of life you will eventually see that there are other things in the world.

You wake up from a Coma. The day is March 1st 2022, you wake up to SPY 300, Evergrande has imploded and the Chinese economy is in a death spiral. The FED just announced a rate hike and and banker hell has been reached. GameStop is $100,000 per share and Ken Griffin is hiding in Zimbabwe. What do you do?
hang seng futures lol
and if it does get exercised, i sell the shares at the strike price. do i still keep the premium?
What if you get the format correct but typed wrong ticker or price?

I‚Äôve been looking to see a close above 8 to buy
Is Burry ok?
They drew first blood, not me
if the calls don't get exercised, you keep the premium and the shares. Correct.
I wonder why so much bullish momentum if that‚Äôs the case. Last week, the unlikely hood of a default had SPY down big. 

These numbers being horrible are more likely yet the reaction isn‚Äôt really there.

Right, opened green, popped a buck or two, traded sideways for a while and closed down ~$2. No pattern there, so just ignore it.
Probably not priced in, but at this point with the market who knows
Everyone knows CPI is gonna be fucked, the question is how badly and will it alter the fed‚Äôs plan to begin tapering
God please
[deleted]
This is the story. Everyone know tapering is happening but what‚Äôs unexpected is just how fast they are going to do it. I think it‚Äôs going to happen in less than the original 7 month period given
That feeling is what addicts you.

Okay but it feels good?
You had me at Brrr4ever
He had nude photos of cheerleaders from the Washington Football Team. Constantly made homophobic remarks about Michael Sam, Roger Goodell, and others. So while I get your point, at least gather more information before you come out screaming "hypocritical"
Probably having the same debate, but with a more nuanced discussion as not nearly as many people would be working two jobs to survive and thus would have more time to consider policy and add substance to the conversation.
Bad move amigo. They will be half price tomorrow.
Or we could abolish the minimum wage and let people negotiate for their own wages. Minimum wage is government permission to pay you crap.
Nothing is ever priced in, anyone who says that it is is a bull with terrible coping skills.
How does that make sense
How far otm are you? You gotta play leaps itm or theta will eat your lunch. I would advise against selling aapl when it‚Äôs down like this.
You meant tits and ass, right?
I mean they‚Äôll call you an asshole.  But yea it‚Äôs pretty gross.

OI on 440 is only 75k. I'm too lazy to work out how much that would have been at the time of buying
The used car prices are a combination of people getting stimulus money which caused a supply shortage. Now that it should be over there is a massive new car shortage which in turn keeps the used car supply demand high.

Rental prices in my area increased over 100% from 2010 to 2019 so it was already going up 10% a year.

It‚Äôs really just the financialization of things, has nothing to do with the real economy. Like the fed printing money in the 1980s to bail out big losses by banks. By the way, those losses by the banks in the 80s wiped all the profits in their histories. 2007-2009 same story. So, you know, it‚Äôll probably be something weird related to that. Who knows if/when a massive crash will happen, but tock market is overvalued though, and 1 trillion trade deficit is the major tale. 

All my opinion, I know nothing.

Good strategy if you have the budget. Buy the shares, sell otm CCs, let them expire worthless,and turn a nice profit every week, in addition to any increase in the value of the shares, plus dividends. Wash, rinse, repeat.

I agree with that and that seems like a reasonable explanation.  Just feels like the volatility suppression at the moment is telling us a part of what's going on.

Feels like I can blink and a minute passes just like that
Institutions are already selling. Dumb retail buys right at open, and the ones selling are the big boys. New bag holders created every day.

Bet we don‚Äôt hear a statement from Apple on this production decrease until earnings on the 27th
Like within weeks, pretty much V shaped.  But it just feels odd this time that volatility is so suppressed.  Has been bugging me for days now.
Captain Punch's OOPS! All bear days!
And this might be BS from Apple. Could just be demand is low due to it being the same phone as last year.
More BABA. Been buying for months with no plans to stop.

I've finally found what works for me and haven't lost money in the last 6 days trading SPY, buy puts or calls depending on how I feel the stock will go and once I see it hit 30% or more then sell. I haven't held options longer than 20 mins and made over 400% in the last week
I think we should be nicer to the bears and start egging them on to short more to be honest. They risk and blow up their accounts shorting so that we can get discounts. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SACRIFICES BEARS YOU WILL BE GONE BUT NEVER FORGOTTEN &lt;3
Pretty embarrassed I fell for that fake pump at close

And for that reason there will be no tapering, the money printers will continue to brrrrr.

That and TSLA carrying
What‚Äôs the #1 movie made for WSB retards, in your opinion, and why is it the wolf of wall street?
The weirdest thing about this selloff is just how little volatility measures are moving; VIX is under 20.

VXX hit all time lows yesterday (with markets still down 5% from ATHs), and is not too far off today.

Just nothing, no volatility spikes, no expected/forward volatility spikes...

Pretty much every other time there was this little movement in volatility during a selloff, it meant we'd be at all time highs pretty quickly after the dip.

The alternative explanation is just that nobody is really prepared for a big selloff down to -10% or so right now.

I‚Äôve got a similar amount of OTM WDC calls. 

You might be fucked on the DRAM front, which doesn‚Äôt effect Western Digitals HDD business. But WDC, STX, &amp; MU move together. May we all ride the wave to the moon.

That's something the Fed wants to avoid. Financial innovation can be very bad for the economy. Can you imagine if our real estate development market was taking money for preorders, and then using it to cover the cost to develop older contracts? üá®üá≥
they should though they have so much cash sitting on the sidelines. Apple pays $14 billion in dividends every quarter if they keep buying back shares at least they reduce that payout
These are the last inflation numbers before fed FOMC in November. Really high inflation  umbers would mean fed is going to for sure go hard on tapering. Market would dump

SDC shows just how hard it is to force a short squeeze by just buying a 40-50% shorted float.

The easy plays are pretty much all gone on the short squeeze front; unless you have some kind of unique thing (deSPAC redemptions like GWH running wild today), there's just not an angle for a short squeeze without big positive news.

SDC needs some big positive earnings surprises, beyond that, there's just no easy way to force a squeeze.

Didn‚Äôt u post this shit yesterday
They let him get away. It‚Äôs fucked
My boyfriend ate his own creampie a few times and confessed he‚Äôd love to eat my pussy with a fresh creampie from another guy. He‚Äôs straight but he loves to see me fucking other men (we‚Äôre swingers).  
  
But condoms were always the norm with other guys, so that it took me like 2 years to find a guy I could trust to let cum inside me. He was an ex-boyfriend who is now married and I happened to bump into. I fucked him alone first and he was an even better lover now. He always had a kinky side and got really excited with the idea of a threesome.  
  
We three finally met last August during business hours, we all skipped work and went to a hotel. No condoms allowed. It was nice to be with two men who I could trust to ride bareback. My ex had a nice and sizable cock and I kept taking turns with him and my BF for a while, I came a few times and my ex was ready to pop. My BF asked him to cum inside me in missionary position, and that was it, he had a nice load and as soon as he was done and took his dick out, I started dripping and my BF ate my pussy full of cum and had a great time. He also went for sloppy seconds and came inside me, as well (he has a smaller cock but a bigger load).  
  
Turns out we met again in September and guess what? They switched places and my ex ate my BF‚Äôs cum this time. I could be wrong but this whole creampie eating thing may not be as rare as some people might think.  
  
To me, the feeling of going raw with two men at the same time was great, I use condoms for protection only, bareback feels better and more intimate. I like when my men leave their seed inside of me, ejaculation turns me on, it‚Äôs a mix of feeling how horny and manly my partners are when fucking me.
Tomorrow consecutive red day #6. This market is completely boned.
Bigly

Apple isn't innovating and now has the same issues as anybody else. Stock will be below $125 at eow and still be massively overvalued. Correction here we come!

Bought the 10/20s when spy was at 435.50 and sold the 10/19s eod
Narrator: "Lil Timmy had a single tear appear at the corner of his eye."

Lil Timmy: "Button mashing calls on SPY. 1000x I had. Why oh why?"

Narrator: "What goes up. Must come down. SPY calls to puts. Green cheeks to brown!"
No more of this sideways bullshit. If the market needs to crash, let it crash hard and get it over with.
Obviously have no idea how options work in relation to stock price so it's all a surprise to me
~20 is already pretty high. I think you‚Äôre better being the option seller than the buyer at this price
this is the easiest trade in history.  The charter is coming. The SP is going up. Their stadium is hosting the superbowl. Their app is amazing and they are hiring 10 people to literally print their credit cards bc they are that busy.
You never know what will be happened next...

I say this just because I got callü•≤
Yeah, since they are all defaulting over there. Won't be pretty.

I would be happy with my gains right now in that stock.  Be happy you got big gains on just an opinion into a red market
COULDN'T FILL MY SHORT POSITIONS FOR TOM HAVE FUN WITHOUT ME

Daily reminder that the FED presidents sold right at the tippy top. What luck!
Where did you find her
Oh I traded at close yesterday and lost $10k, but got in at close today with puts. Made a ton of money swing trading spy so I‚Äôm not worried.

I don‚Äôt disagree, although I‚Äôve had success trading tsla gaps. I‚Äôll exit immediately if I‚Äôm up at open.

I got at close. Will be done with options for a bit if this position blows up.

If SPY even twitches the wrong way we fuk
Hashtag cancel apple
Big down tomorrow seems way too easy. So flat?
It could be much worse tomorrow. It‚Äôs not the AH movement, it‚Äôs the very bearish news that‚Äôs significant
I was early and got my ass kicked today. Reloaded for a gap down but who knows.
We‚Äôre in this together üêª
I've been really paper handsy lately. SPY fucked and everyone knows.

Holy GUH. Rip in peace mate
Tim should have just Cooked the books
I was looking at the charts for a witty comeback, but the long lower shadow on most time frames looks to be a signal (albeit relatively weak) that there are those looking to buy soon.

It touched the descending channel's bottom, but it's a steep channel and the next candle could easily be red if the general market trends that way.
Less iphone makes price higher soo bullish asf

that's only a theory. in reality tech has outperformed everything over the past ten years, whether rates were going up or down.
chip shortage -&gt; lowered production of phones
Won't be me. I'll never buy AAPL again.
I made 800% on a particular Friday morning 200p
Wow you looking @ 117...

We‚Äôll be down big in the morning and TSLA will still be green. I can feel it in my plums.

Member when we were at 440 like 3 days ago üò•
Thanks for this
Some people need to text "what are you up to" less and "here's what I'm up to" more
Apple smooth and linear slide AH. Tomorrow probably -6%
Well, no one said they needed chips for EVERY phone. Can't this shit just work on the cloud?
The only % that matters is the last %
bullard doesn't decide these things, him saying that doesn't mean anything.
Thought about it with the 3rd test of support but I think it might go to $10 if support breaks
Wait don‚Äôt confuse this for me liking the king of all retards. I just don‚Äôt want to pay taxes, like him.
Isn‚Äôt TheScore like the RC Cola version of ESPN?
What‚Äôs happening w apple
What the fuck was that jesus christ
Fed's Bullard on CNBC: "Economy is doing fine, inflation is higher in the US than other places in the world" and implies monetary policy is causing inflation
&gt;Apple's bankruptcy announcement will drag down the whole market tomorrow. Another day bull r fuk.

Lol I was looking at some put credit spreads today.
Tsla puts
Down 4k on the week. Disgusting. SPY please fly again
Might be portfolio wiped tomorrow. Holding 20k all in on SPY calls 435 expiring tomorrow

Why is spy getting crapped on after hours?
OCGN and wait to WHO approved‚Ä¶.
Looking to open a few of those shortly..
its not a bear market until the spy 200p gang out roaming the after hour thread again
Market is fucked tomorrow because of AAPL
Thought leaps would be safe but they've been bleeding well over a month now.
If ya don't know ya don't know - insiders
A correction. It‚Äôs healthy
Expecting it to be. But they have it pegged at 80 for the whole day on the futures.
That was me. I got a girl pregnant and had to liquidate. Remember to wear a rubber guys.
Smart money unloading bags üíº
It is but its still gonna fuk us for a long while imo
PENN acquisition of TheScore just approved plus the charts show it's been coiling up in a wedge shape so obvious even I spotted it, seems like there could be a major breakout soon. Anyone playing this currently? I've got straight calls and depending on how things play out, might scale in more if it gets/holds above \~75.30 tomorrow
Aapl dumping
I just fucked a cute Japanese girl. 10/10 will do a 3rd time
ü§°
Picked up DIS and F calls, don‚Äôt know how much a red day would affect them tomorrow but it‚Äôs probably not a good sign
The only thing transitory is the profits of bulls
Got 10 432p pray for me
It‚Äôs down 1.33% after hours that‚Äôs how spoiled this market has been and how far it can fall.  AAPL could go to the 70-80 range and still be at the higher end of its historical valuation
AH is just a block of red on the inline volume thing
Bad news to more bad news for AAPL the last month. For fuck sake. Not looking forward to earnings
[deleted]
Yeah. I'm upset I didn't catch it until right at close.
It‚Äôs easy to time it perfect when you control enough pieces.
Hail the psychic
All you retards been spamming the chat asking for apple news was trying to help lead the blind
AAPL used to be 6.7% of SPY and after rebalancing its 5.9% of SPY today so Apple moves affect SPY less now
It's a VERY IMPORTANT 1%
Hopefully $BABA will keep flying
What‚Äôs going with spy? Some weird stuff
Apple's bankruptcy announcement will drag down the whole market tomorrow. Another day bull r fuk.
AAPL üí©ing the üõèÔ∏è
I was told inflation was transitory.
Thank God, by sheer luck I closed out 3 AAPL cash covered puts this morning
are you tits up in aapl calls too , cuz I am legit baffled I am this fucking unlucky the one day I bought aapl calls
I said it in the morning: 

AAPL to 138 look at my comments
Bullard seems high as fck
CRSP results out and look pretty good. Market might have been hoping for more though so may be selling the news? Conference call in 10 minutes though so this could reverse once Management gives more context.
Printer goes brrrr less and less each month for a few months until no more brrrr

UVXY, VXX calls at close today was free money
Lots of horrible news over the next three weeks with a few positive ERs in between‚Ä¶ we are going down bigly
im scared to go back to theta gang with amd. too much uncertainty
They decide when the top is, so I guess that's a nice little perk
Going back to 429 tomorrow
Someone dumped 10 million shares of apple at close. Literally more than a billion dollars. What the fuck happened
nice little after hours sell off Jesus christ
Wait til it hits the 200 day MA
Why wouldn‚Äôt u buy puts when it was at 435.50
That dog is going to be eating steak soon
It's apple bobbing season.
SOFI AH always funky.
So Tim Apple just gonna go and tank the whole market right when it was about to turn around. Figures.
I fucking had the winning ticket SPY 433p 10/18 sold at open for 65 percent gains fuck me it will be a 3 bagger at open tomorrow
Lately RH has been so fucking slow. It's like 5-10 minutes behind on quotes.
FAANG just getting hit left and right. Facebook today, Apple AH and tomorrow.  Whats next for Amazon?  Remove their mask to reveal it was WISH all along!?!
TSLA is the next Big Short
Been banking cash in my boomer portfolio for a nice AAPL dip.
Oil pegged at 80. It‚Äôs amazing how much control they have over the prices
Oofta.
I got puts at close. Prob gonna lose money on them. 

I just looked at the chart and thought I‚Äôd make my first TSLA play lol.
Boring theta plays the only thing keeping me green.  All my calls under water
Sell em and you‚Äôll be just fine.
Great entry considering the ah news. I'm shocked aapl is struggling with chip supply, lol. How can this not be priced in? I regarded smooth üß† ü§° tho.
Tech does not do well in a rising rate environment. Apple does not have increasing profits. Why is it above $85 which is where it was before the March 2020 crash?  Why?
If trump agrees to not tax the piss out of life he can come back and say whatever crazy shit he wants.

Was fun today. Bought more puts at close because fuck SPY right now
Tim Apple Guh...
Somebody quick! Reassure me on my SPY and apple calls for Friday üò≠
Making no plays is an option. Only take good setups.

How is that a daytraders dream? No way anyone could predict the price movement today and if you could what you were in for one candle at a time?
Mother of all sell signals and bulls still think we will be back at ATH soon
Cutting iPhone production bigly because of chip shortage
I'm a bull and would
Tech is uninvestable led by Apple aka King Loss
Fair warning. H4 is a a doji and lower TFs essentially bull.

But I'm holding SPY puts too so I'll toast to that.
Dumb bulls got owned once again. LOL
mooning is so gay lmao
Held my 10/15 puts into close.  Feast or famine Tomm
duuude, me too. I'm fucked. The only news I see is "positive results from phase 1...."

$PLTR slowly creeping up again. Lots will miss the ship once again

[deleted]
waste of a day.

Lmao spy really went up and down, down to the last 2 candles of the day lmao literally a daytrader's nightmare
That‚Äôs old news
OCGN could gap up here

Well I switched it up and bought spy calls today and was decimated pretty bad. I‚Äôve been destroyed before tho so I‚Äôll live
What is the fuck is happening with crispr????
WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK HAPPENED TO APPLE?
AAPL probably opening @130-135 tm!!
Where you get this info? Last I checked AAPL and MSFT were 1-2
I honestly thought that AAPL movement was a glitch. FUCK
Worked for me to gtfo
fud pushing pussies everywhere. The stench.
For this thread it was the perfect move

Wow Crispr just fucked me so hard
Good job buddy
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt double dip?! It‚Äôs like putting your whole hand in there!‚Äù
TQQQ call is the wayü§ë
Great day for commodities
ü•≥
Good thing I didn‚Äôt buy AAPL calls at close.
It doubled with no extra profits. Only an increased PE. Fed made it happen. Fed has to pull back now. It‚Äôs THAT simple.
Apple was a larger % of SPY before recent rebalancing tho
Absolutely love the apple buying opportunity
366th or so.
AAPL is cutting IPhone production due to chip shortage.
buy puts when everything is deep in the red

Must get near 136 before atone touch
Ah yes... I remember taking 6 months off the market after
Gay bears would blow anything
Hehe I‚Äôm just teasing. My puts keep printing though even with Vix fucking them
SPYing on TWNK's in the HOOD got me feeling silly
It‚Äôs the largest holding lol üôÑü§£
I guess when you can't give the phone away through carrier it is all *chip shortage*.  No way the new phone that has nothing new isn't selling well.
Need more!
Lol the aapl covered call i sold is safe for now

Welp,  tomorrow  11am is the bottom. I'll be selling everything if we don't go up above today's close by then.

Less apple phones = justifies price increase. Strengthens luxury brand image. Bullish af

holy shit.... apple to cut iPhone output targets by 10 million because of chip shortage!?
What the fuck is CRSP doing ah?
10mil less iPhones produced due to chip shortage
Why this is even new today.  Has been going on for a while and it's getting worse with Gyna power crisis.

Kekw
We do not.

Just an FYI.

Feel free to have an all you can eat though.
bears are in control, bulls are completely in shambles
Did I forget to turn off the money printer again
Too bad it didn't fool anyone. Too little, too late. Not working anymore.
Vix is going down. It will go back up after a big red day no worries. I was down a bunch but bought more and ended up big
If you say it in a mirror 3 times a polar bear jumps out of the mirror and fucking mauls you to death for wasting so much computational energy
Red October: Commie bears is taking over!
Chip shortage fucking with IPhone production
Yes you are correct, quick tough lesson learned
Oh wait until earnings discount central
The trend is so bearish got dame
Good thing Apple is not as huge part of SPY after rebalancing as before.
Puts on cashflow's ego.
Yeah I have no plans to diamond hands these if it looks bad at open
I bought 7 10/13 430 SPY puts. Im alr up 60%
So you‚Äôre telling me SPY calls at close were not the move?
Whats up with Apple?
[deleted]
Someone got caught Blowing Tim Cook‚Äôs Whistle lookout
Ah yes i forgot about that since I never think about it. Funny nonetheless
Profit is profit. For all you know we could open green for some reason

Kinda, apple won‚Äôt be able to hit production goals due to chip shortage
BoA said PC market is declining and cited AAPL as one of the company that will be affected.
[deleted]
Irony?
Tim Apple cuttin phones. They are rebranding as an oil company.
Pray for entire market to turn üåø.
The fact my Portfolio is up $37,000 since September 1st is a lot less impressive when you click on my gains and it shows I made $50,000 in deposits in that time :(
Do you want spy to be 200? Then sure.
Anyone else pick up RKLB at the end there?
holy fuck I thought the pain was over but AAPL bails on me too. Actually feel like a clown right now
##I am the greatest trader to have ever lived
Yeah its dumb rule if you say the actual name the post gets removed
what happened to aapl in ah? some news break?
chip shortage mang

You said OCGN wrong

CCJ did just fine for me today ‚ò¢Ô∏è
Soon tho‚Ä¶ üëÄ
Fuck yeah, don‚Äôt stop.
Lol read the other comments. Cutting iPhone production by like 10million due to chip shortage.
S&amp;P went down 0.24% on barely over half the average daily volume? Dip is faker than Caitlyn Jenner's tits.
Doesn‚Äôt seem like that‚Äôs gonna be happening anymore‚Ä¶.. they killed it man‚Ä¶. üò¢üò¢
Are you numb nuts still not in CLOV?
U didn‚Äôt say anything
420 incoming ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Not even that they don‚Äôt want, just already have a newish iPhone.  Hard to see where the growth keeps coming from
Sad I have to get AAPL news on WSB instead of CNBC  interrupting this lady doofus
Bitcorn.
Wanted to switch my 10/15 puts for 10/20. So bought the 10/20 when spy was at 435.50 and sold my 10/15s eod ‚ò∫Ô∏è
valid
KOOOOSSSSSSS
Picked up a few SPY puts. I know afterhours numbers generally don't mean jack shit, but it looks like it's headed in the right direction for me to print!
Bruh I forgot to cancel my orders &amp; they sold my puts fml
so half of my watchboard is green, other half red, so meh day?

my own portfolio ended in what best be described as flat
Yo wtf happened to Apple
Apple going to tank on earnings,  also bruh bitcorn is fucking dying rn lol
They saw that you bought and they said dump it
Great boomer stock for sideways churn
Tech sucks weenie, energy its izzzzzüòé
It was down, and below key levels. How is it bullish?
\*looks behind\*

Price action says "nooooo".
OH MY GOD HOW IS APPLE DOWN ONE WHOLE PERCENT 

HOW WILL IT EVER RECOVER
THat's the kind of nice bearish close you like to see to scare the noobs out of the deep waters lol
Would be dope
They found Tim Cook emails omg
Retest 18
Might have just sharted. Good thing it‚Äôs almost 5
There‚Äôs volume on AAPL AH and the movement is significant so something happened. 

Did some company similar to AAPL release bad earnings?
Appl tanking and dragging it down.
Glad I held those poots
Can we vote Apple out of the SP500 plz
AAPL waited until AH to drop this bombshell.
BLK tomorrow. We bought everything...Fuck Them Kids.
19.47
Fuck, I missed my chance to buy SPY calls EOD because I forgot Robinhood only gives until 5 mins after market close
10-15 FB $330c bought for .90. They are $1.56 at close. Need a good 1% to 3% jump tomorrow to really scalp some tendies
I loaded up on ASTS yesterday so this was nice
Vix is fucking my puts. Was down 700. Ended day up a grand
$19.5 intraday, $19 EOD
SPY calls at 480 by Saturday evening!
Invest in faang they say. Its sound investment they say. Smh
SOFI under 18
Rip anyone with short term appl calls.
RUN FOR YOUR LIFE JESUS FUCK
They announced a new Macbook. It was just an iPhone repaint.
Damn. We‚Äôve got another month of misery coming on the market. Ah well.
breaking: Tim Cook ate some chips, mistakes Silicon for Sour &amp; Cream
Did 5 trades today. All green. Small profits though.
Nobody wants the iPhone 13 so they blame it on a chip shortage.
Two digits!

Two digits!

*Chanting*
SOFI prediction for tm?
Doomp eet
AAPL broke the market AGAIN..
Are bers less üåàright now?
We are getting a ginormous green dong tomorrow. The Meme Stock Revolution will return.
News is chip suppliers struggling to meet $AAPL demand. 

Market is going to be down for sure tomorrow on this news.
AAPL 150p for Jan 22 print so hard wow
This woman's voice is low af
objectively not if you look at GME or AMC a year ago lmao
What happened to Apple after hours?
The news is they're overpriced
Dummy
Current inflation is driven by supply constraints don‚Äôt @ me
HOLY FUCK AAPL , U DUMB WHORE. I THOUGHT THE DAY COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE
Holding 10 432p. Hoping 420 is not a meme
I've not trarded for about 2 months cos work out me in a spot with no connection. I'm back right at market close, what we buying tomorrow?

OCGN after hour party just beginning
CPI is either gonna be the start of the actual correction or we're just gonna melt back up to ATH, there is no in-between.  That's how out of touch with reality this market is right now.

Apple slashing iPhone production due to chip shortage. Rip

APPLE SLASHING IPHONE PRODUCTION DUE TO CHIP SHORTAGE
that bill gates backed battery company better be a pnd
AAPL dumping due to news that they have to cut back on iPhone production due to Chip shortage.
UPST dragging my portfolio through the fiery depths of hell right now.
Yo did tim apple raped someone?
Ocugen You Mah Fren~

It‚Äôs a song. 

I wrote it.
Spy just dumped instantly after the bell

sell everything its tanking! bears will be rich!
Holy shit aapl
Really someone short SPY so badly

Welfare check on the guy who‚Äôs been spamming 10/15 450c. I haven‚Äôt seen him around‚Ä¶
Got TSLA Oct 15 795P at close

Up slightly post market 

If I lose ~50% on these I‚Äôll be done with options for awhile
Fuck it. Cutting my spy call losses and dumping them into $F leaps. If you have calls in $F then here is your sign to dump them
did i discover an infinite money hack? EOD overnight straddles on MARA @ current price. each contract costs in the area of \~1,1.5 dollars. I need MARA to swing $2-3 in EITHER direction at open the next day, which i pretty much has every single day going back a while, and I make money. Better yet, I sell the direction that's profitable and hold the other for the inevitable rebound. If I had discovered this yesterday I'd be a much richer man.
Tomorrow‚Äôs CPI print is gonna be hotter than Scarlett Johansson. Loaded up on QQQ $355p and SPY $443P.
I think this time futures will matter. I made 15k yesterday and lost 6.5k. Fuck My life. I was up 2k and then the final fake pump wipes out my gains and I went negative again. Should have held my puts. Fuck my life
Me owning calls

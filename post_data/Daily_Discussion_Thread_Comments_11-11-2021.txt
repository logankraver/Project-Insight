I have been at work for 90 mins and I already hate my coworkers voice.
Markets look great. I'm so glad we were able to get U.S. inflation under control over the last 16 hours.
I need to be beaten with sticks until all my latent bear tendencies are gone.

NEVER. FUCKING. BUY. PUTS. ON. ANYTHING. YOU. RETARD.

I literally only ever lose money that way.
Imagine being a gay ass forex trader. Bitches trying to make money trading money with money.

If I made just $100 a day, I could live off the market. Why must we be so easily succumbed to greed and lose it all trying to hit that 10 bagger? 

$100 a day and I’m out, if it ends up more before I move on, great, if not, at least I’m making progress.

Food for thought. Have a great day everybody and enjoy a nice cup of coffee
I stopped losing 10k a day, now it's only 2k. Things are looking up
I realize that a majority of the time I’m in this sub I’m just talking to myself hoping one of you schmucks validates my stupid decisions.
My favorite thing about trading is when my option makes money and Im unable to sell so I hold the next day for a big loss.

My 4hr chart SPY looks like the same set up from October's dip. Are we expecting a red day or finally another 2-3 day pump. If it follows a similar trend, it should be at 475 EOW. Nearly all SPY stocks are green pre-market except GOOG. By all metrics that I can see, SPY should be a green pump day and our bullish trend should continue after that mega drop. 

Thoughts?

/u/talm0 (1/1) made a bet that MSFT would go to 305.0 when it was 324.77 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
>	China Evergrande Group once again averted a default with a last-minute payment of coupons on three dollar bonds before the 30-day grace period ended. It comes amid wider speculation that the crackdown on the property market in China is starting to ease, with a series of articles published in state media signaling support measures may be on the way. A gauge of real estate stocks jumped 5.7% overnight and high-yield dollar bonds rose. Despite the increased optimism on a resolution to the problems, the wider fallout from slowdown in the Chinese property market is clear.

So they didn’t default? No idea what’s going on here.
We are back to "Inflation is actually good".  Green day.
My calls and puts are down.
Lcid fucking hell
I actually can't remember what it feels like to win on a trade
my friend, let's call him "*me,"* has just lost his job. It would be very cool and legal if SPY could rally 50 - 75 points into the close for my friend, me.

Only to watch them go +300% the next day.

/u/donkey199 (1/1) made a bet that RIVN would go to 120.0 when it was 0.0 and it did, congrats you fuckin nerd.
I swear shit dips as soon as I buy it
Every time I sell some covered calls, the price rockets up and my shares get called away and I miss out on gains.

Except PLTR.  I’ve had these shares forever and my cc’s keep expiring worthless.
Buy high sell higher
Just a friendly reminder that PLTR is the worst stock of 2021, I demand a trophy for it!
I probably own more cars than rivn does
Word on the street is Lordstown to report blowout earnings when someone finds a surprise quarter laying on the ground.
This market has been so fucking wild my lord

so much volatility can be very profitable for the right trader

unfortunately i am not the right trader
Take profits on WISH now or you’ll WISH you did later
I thought I was so fucking smart buying 3K in WISH puts, when lighting 3K on fire would've at least been a heat source
I just want to thank god that he made me too retarded to figure out how to trade options

but not too retarded that I couldn't find boomers on youtube to guide me
Perfect time for PayPal to buy PSFE instead of PINS
Whoever came up with “you win some you lose some” clearly never traded options
RIVN is finally an over priced IPO again where you can buy in one day like a dumbass and still make money lol

150k in PSFE going back to February, downbto 30k. If I kill myself you'll know why.
you ever buy an option without doing underlying stock research. I didn't even look it's chart. What a rush
SPY with the roughly 0% day, fucking classic.

So everyone likes Tesla and Elon again now right? Just until the next time he completely fucks everyone? 🥴👍

Raise your hand if you held through the last 2 blood red days, and now you’re hoping today everything jumps up 15% you break even next few hours 🙌🏻
Went from 40k to 90 bucks this year

I’m pretty proud guys I timed this dip almost perfectly. Sold 1/3 my longs and bought SPY and QQQ poots at the exact top and then sold my poots and re-added to my strongest positions yesterday afternoon. Magical crayons ftw
Wild that you can watch weeks of patience and hope get flushed in hours. Looks like I'm bag holding PSFE thought my $7.60A was great. ALWAYS WRONG

Put a quarter in my ass because I PLAYED myself.
Checked out all night. Did evergrande pay their last bill or something? At 4 o’clock yesterday, the world was ending. I go online this morning and everyone is chilling lol
lmao PSFE got fucking murdered
PSFE holy fuck
Maybe one day I’ll learn my fucking lesson and stop holding Disney calls through earnings.
PSFE -32%.. kinda over kill but damn.
Still pissed I chose Apple over Microsoft last month 🤡
Spy 1/22 500C 📈📈📈
Nvidia wrong way
What's inflation when you can lower your own net worth
PANIC, IT'S OVER, EVERGRANDE DEFAULTED!

Wait, they paid?

This is how they paid. Made a rumor they couldn't pay.  Short sold the market. Took profit. Released the press they paid the debt.

Rinse and repeat.

edit: just shitposting. Guy below me is actually correct here.
Imagine musk in the toilet on robinhood selling his shares
Who makes better bags? Wsb or Louis Vuitton
Waiting for spy to bottom out this time before I buy my calls. She can be a cold bitch if you don't treat her right.
Did we not tell you Musk has to sell like 19 more times to meet his goal
Anyone else loading un on cheap DIS calls for investors day tomorrow?

Way too much downward pressure. My positions are fucked
What a red day, down 5k :(
Uhh i bought OCGN after it fell 45% and it keeps falling. Lol maybe it will become a penny stock.
BBBY going parabolic!

60% reported short interest, likely much more if GME taught us anything.
TSLA movements are truly autistic today
> CEOs literally just mentioning metaverse to pump their company… im convinced they dont even know what it is

Reminds me of "CEOs literally just mentioning "blockchain technology" to pump up their stock price numbers... .....
Pump up them sheets: BBBY
So glad I got in on BBBY yesterday before close yesterday.  Finally a win.
Bed, Bath, and Beyond the atmosphere.
I'm beginning to think my 11/12 SPY 470c's are not gonna print

Jeff Bezos the kind of guy to toot during sex then blame it on a queef
8% return today. 

Good day!
I have realistic trading expectations - I simply ask that all my tickers to go up 3%-5% every day - yet I'm constantly let down.
[deleted]
looks they think tapering and raising interest rates would cool inflation.


But have they considered printing even more money? I mean we wont know if it works until we try it.

My $18 dividend just cleared, looks like meats back on the menu boys
Looks like there's gonna be a big sell off tomorrow.
Well, pray for me boys, bought at the top today a bunch of DIS and AMD.  May the calls be forever in my favor... probably should have thought better about those 1DTE calls on the mouse... gap up tomorrow?
Broker called me and told me there are these never-expiring leaps called “shares.” That’s the craziest shit, man
Anyone else have a perpetual fear of balding
I asked mistress for SPY to go up, but she just stepped on my balls like usual

Market breaking ATH for the Veterans, god bless 🇺🇸
Markets aren’t closed on Veterans Day because they know vets (myself included) are degenerate gamblers 🤣

Happy Veterans Day folks 🇺🇸
Good earning, bad earning, no earnings. Any one of these will cause my PSFE bags to get fuller and heavier. 

This is the way, as we used to say around here.
damn look at AFRM premarket, knew i should have gambled on some cheap weeklies
I have nothing valuable to add to the discussion other than bears have a tendency to engage in homoerotic behaviour
Why everytime i buy option i lose money
TSLA GAP UP 🚀🚀
Inflation talks going well
i think i made a solid $50 off disney puts im rich
Glad loaded Spy call at the close yesterday . They printing at open 472 my target
SOFI my only earnings winner this quarter so far
ermagherd INFLAERTION - fucking dummies like inflation just popped up out of nowhere yesterday or some shit. People's IQ must be 1
Plantards r fuk’d always. +2% pre market just means -3% eod
Let me get this straight, because they *now sell popcorn* they are unironically calling themselves "popcorn stock."

Good stuff. Sounds like a cool stock.
I bought a bunch of lollipops and jawbreakers to help me lose weight. I think they’re like 30 calories each. Much better than a 200+ calories bag of Doritos
Please NVDA and AND take us to the promise land
Might go full boomer and buy a bunch of T today, soak up dividends for the next decade.
So people dumping PSFE at -18% pre actually believe it will go lower?
No settled cash due to the holiday, fuckkk
# PSFE down 30% LMAOOOOOOO
Tsla appears to be fixin for a nice little ripperoni this morning
Apparently I need to sell my amd and nvda puts at open
Gold is mad at the world
Do you think Joe Kernen get nervous around thanksgiving that he might get mistaken for a turkey? That neck.

no, deal or no deal killed my family
My favourite part is when they play the game out apart they pussied out
This is too much green, it’s so hard to fight away my 🌈🐻 instincts
Spy green pre market, please stay green all day I can’t have another blood red day after losing 1/4 of my portfolio yesterday
It’s going red. Sorry bud
STOP DROPPING SPY
Sometimes it almost seems like I enjoy lighting my hard earned money on fire.
I've taken losses before no big deal, but to watch my call option lose half it's value as it literally jumped 12 dollars...can't take that
decay ate your ass
Did the same to me with Sofi. Really rude
buy further out exp dates and you wont have to worry about theta decay
Hold up. Wish is green? I like this idea.
What about PROG?
I feel like you have to be retarded to lose money in this market, and unfortunately I am retarded
If you're not in PSFE, this is not your chance to buy. This is a warning to stay the hell away from it.
Why? Been looking at psfe for months p
All it has done is go down for months...
Chart does look like WISH…
I'd wait for a solid trend reversal before going all in. Best of luck
You mean it dumped 30% in the am and I shouldn't think that's a red flag? *'bUh DuH dIsCoUnTs!'*
elaborate on why not to touch it, cause im thinking of going allin
Zoom out to the one-year. Three weeks after it was listed it hit an ATH of around $20 in January. Since that time it has been a very steady downward trend with the occasional relief rally. It looks like the relief comes after big drops, so maybe its worth a shot, but this stock goes goes down, not up.
Yeah, but it's not like this is a company without a product, though. Feels like all air is out already.
I mean it could pan out, maybe you'll successfully catch the knife. That said, PSFE has been bounced around this subreddit since it hit that ATH and had done nothing but tank.
For sure, most companies that ipo'd this year or late last year had a lot of air in them. But we'll see, don't dare to go calls here so stonks it is until/if it catches momentum.
That's a good plan. Leaps (1-2 years) or shares for sure. FDs on this one would be truly autistic.
There was a 10 part DD on $psfe here last week. I wonder how op is doing
fucking dead
PSFE has literally never gone up, some things don’t change.

How is DOOR TRASH still pumping

Tesla is such a weird stock I swear.
Lcid is having a good day why is no one talking about Lcid haha

Is earnings worth playing Monday? If rivian is proof of concept then Lcid should be 60 easy. Rivian a never even sold a car
Earnings will be risky. But it's running up until end of the day Monday.
I am allergic to gains
Remember that time Elon sold a teeny piece and stock tanked 18% in two days? Well he’s back for more.

I feel like Wish is tip toeing with potentially having some ridiculous meme moon today. Its up a bunch.. but fucking around just shy of $6. It hits $6 and its running. Should only take about eight years to get back to what I paid.
Dog years?

Best I can do is $4.28
I can go as low as .....$8.08!
I’ll offer $3.50

The collective market cap of world’s car makers has increased $500B+ in the past six months. Mostly from EVs entering the game but without a significant pullback on the valuations of legacy automakers. I don’t think there’s going to be enough cars on the road going forward to justify this collective automakers market cap increase. Something’s gotta give
Fucking MOVE UP NVIDIA. I’m in NYC and will take the bull by the literal horns if it hits $315 by EOD Friday

RIVN CEO is named RJ Syringe. Probably a heroin addict. Puts on RIVN.
I think you meant calls. he sounds like a hard worker who isn't afraid to roll up his sleeves.
Yeah, he really rolls up his sleeves every time things get painful. You just know he's resilient and will shoot straight through any situation that comes his way!
Thinking about going in on DIS Dec calls at close
I bought some Jan’s earlier today

Analysts bashing it
Jeff Bezos GF looks like Pennywise

My puts went from -30% to -25% 😎
Glad i sold pltr puts before close yesterday
I think I am cursed for Tesla. I buy a call it goes down. I buy a put. It goes up.
Ever thought about credit spreads?  Takes the up/down out of the equation.
I am trying to get rich here. I do it with other stocks.
>I am trying to get rich here.

>I do it with other stocks.

Do you not see the TSLA gain porn and realize the pattern?...
Put a dollar in… get a Tesla? Modern Mr Pappageorgio
That's the plan. Good luck
Can you do me a fav and buy more puts. Thx
Sure.  How much you want me to lose.
Elon spamming the market sell rn

Why don't you guy target acb , Aurora cannabis.  The short interest is insane right now
No one is targeting anything.
What a disgusting market
I have a simple question I would like an answer to:

What the fuck?
Anyone else notice If you put a sell order in on Robin Hood for an option, the price will quickly change in the opposite direction of your sell price? Real question.
You're effecting the value of the option by bidding on it. Very common.
Happens if there’s a wide Bid/Ask. 

Bid: $20

Ask: $50

Value shown: $35. 

If you try to sell at $35 then it drops the Ask to $35 and the value will drop to $28 or something.
Cool man, thanks for clarifying it. I appreciate you
Why are you even on RH lmao
I'm ruined
It’ll come back, always does!
How would you respond to the question “What is it you really do?” from your manager’s manager?
“I mostly do what you think my manager does.”
Just mention some BS about KPIs
I leverage data analytics to streamline our tactical engagement with KPIs.

Not sure what that means, but I’m using it
huh, crazy, I do this too
Managers love KPIs
Throw in some OKRs and, baby, you’ve got a stew goin’

Just sitting here averaging down on my 12/31 SPY 500c
are paysafe 11/19 calls a good play rn? i feel like there will be a correction, might not be a big one but there has to be one after a 40% drop.
Don’t do a Friday, man.
I’m never going to have to worry about wealth changing me.
I think I'd have better odds if I went to a casino, and then lit my money on fire.
You can have a full on conversation with someone who does TA using only Astrology terminology and it will take them 15 minutes to catch on. "Yeah, I use the Prime Meridian to devine the stocks astro sign and project future growth, based on the gemini or capricorn model. The Palm life line is really good and points to future meetings and acquisitions."

Like I'm all for bi-tendies- stocks mostly go up but they can go downies too.  Make tendies wherever.

Ahellyea
the mouse is fuk
My calls are fucked but might add more shares.
RIOT back to $40s today.
as long as evergrande keeps quiet. and corn keeps pumping, RIOT is the best major miner play.
Between today and tomorrow, I'm anticipating some of the longer-term shorts from the April Whinstone acquisition (dilution) announcement as well as the late August shelf announcement (big dilution) will close.  Add in retailers and institutions dipping their toes in before ER and you have a move from today to low $40s by EOD on Monday.  Hopefully most of this occurs between today and tomorrow.

&#x200B;

That's with corn floating between $64200 and $65500.

&#x200B;

If it breaks out later this afternoon to $66000 to $67000 then mid-$40s isn't that far off.
Went to cash last week for SPY and Qqq.  Waiting for bottom.  Bought the Arkk dip yesterday.  Letting IWM  calls run.  Letting MRNA puts run. Letting MARA calls run.  May close Pfizer puts and tile calls
Well done! I should jump on MARA or RIOT calls
Shrek is back in town?
fuck, the ticker always go to the moon after I sold it. Sold didi two days ago for more PLTR like a retard.
Sorry man. Didi probably going to go nuts today might not be too late
Gape me PSFE, I expect a pounding sir
[deleted]
Yes, it was yesterday
Just because you pumped off a few sailors during their port call in Bangkok back in ‘87 doesn’t make you a veteran.
Kinda, it's called navy Federal credit union
You served in the war on Christmas too?
What’d you do soldier?  Hand jobs while peeling potatoes?
Selling out of my DIS puts and UVXY puts, which I was angrily told were too early to buy yesterday. Hmmm. Starting to think some of you don't actually know anything.
I had calls I sold then but buying back in along with TSLA. Also today puts on Roblox. Made $4000 on that yesterday. I’m not a financial advisor.
Hopefully Evergrande shit is going to keep giving us a buying opportunity every month as their next payment approaches. Pahhmp eeet
Damn did PSFE say the N word?
Fuck you for making me watch toast the rest of the week ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
> I think you're just mad because I have a better life than you.
Damn Visualmod going for a deep burn
Hahaha
People want to buy high and sell low.
Is today the time to buy tesla calls?
Yesterday
I lifted weights yesterday for the first time. Pretty much all muscle groups. Can I lift again today or should I rest a day
Should wait 48 hours for recovery. This is why most people do a split and train certain muscle groups on certain days. 

Do some active recovery. Light walking/yoga/swimming etc.
Cardio today and stretch.  Even if you don't wanna do cardio definitely stretch.
Okay I just stretched because of ur comment ty. Could barely reach lol
Rest. Unless you didn’t do legs.
Chamaath has joined the chat ….
So some very light lifting or stretch as you're gonna be really sore. Just keep moving to get that lactic acid burned off
Okay I stretched ty. Was so stiff lol
How intense was it? If you just tried everything out, you can still lift, but focus on a few muscle groups instead. Find a training program and stick to it. Otherwise, take one or two days off.
> It was very intense. I tried everything out, but focused on a few muscle groups instead.
Get after it!
Depends on what you’re eating to recover and how you feel
did you do glutes?
I did squats w a kettlebell
make sure to stretch....the 2 day rule in effect! you'll be sore!
Wait for the 24-36 hour mark for the pain to set in. Do some light work to keep the muscles from getting too tight…gonna hurt for a few days. Abs are okay to do every day but you should wait 2 days between muscle groups.
Take tren and lift everyday
Your muscles grow from the failure/rest cycle.  You need rest between sessions.  Don't hit every muscle group every time.  Popular splits are the bro split or push pull split.  You can Google those for specific exercises
If you didn't life to failure then you're probably fine to go light today.
So i buy Puts end of day yesterday and stocks are green as fuck today.
Can you do this again today?
Bro, you’re aware the feds are still a fucking printer. Steak dinner today!
Imagine being named Buford. Like what would you even do?
that's a dog name
Prob marry a southern belle
fart a lot
thats a dope name
You’d be a Smokey who chases Bandits
Become a sheriff
That's a deputy name
Go by a nickname like Ford...and drive a Bronco.

not hoping for bad things to happen to real people and the US balance sheet so the market will keep pumping
They are around. Most are speechless though as they held their puts over night and are now quite concerned. Dumb bers.
8 am meetings are against the Geneva convention
GET THE PRINTERS RUNNING HOT AND OPEN THE FUKIN CASINO !!!!!!
Broke gang where you at?

Yo
🎉
Need SoFi to hit $25 this week so I don’t get banned. Looks like I have a shot!
I’m buying calls, this stock looks like a solid play
April 22 Jan 23 are the way! Big year coming in 22
Pay safe? More like payunsafe amirite?
PainSafe
You sir are right
Holy shit is wish actually a real company ? The front page is fucking scary
Fuck that company short it till its delisted
> Wish is a real company. They are based in China and have been around since 2010.
So it’s a Chinese data mining website-got it
I don't think so.  To data mine people need to give you data.  With that web interface boomers couldn't type in their SSN even if they wanted too.
Don't trust VisualMod, he bullshits half the time.
$sofi to 30 eod
It's safe to say psfe ain't shit - no wonder they failed the first time when they went public.  What a pos - why did I baghold this shit
My covered calls didn't come close to making up for the losses i took on that turd. Glad i dumped it weeks ago.
Gonna take a big fucking hit.  Gonna give up on the piece of shit
PSFE cuts FY21 guidance from 1.55 B to 1.47 and stonk drops 30%? WTF the stonk markets.
Goddamn PSFE bags HEAVY.
"PaySafe provides online payment solutions such as integrated processing, ecash, and selling heavy bags to autists".
Nothing like waking up to 30% down.
Slicing through my shoulders at this point
I might buy today to see if it can climb up 15-20%. Just a quick day trade. Not catching a knife tho, will wait maybe 30 minutes after open to see if I buy.
But srsly who tf is buying wish?
Dumbasses that won't let my puts print.
SoFi gonna take me sohigh today
Market is back , loading up PLTR calls.
Lmao
For reals for reals why is palantir so low n never moves in orice.. the things they do i dont think people realize the magnitude of improtance.
Only low IQ dunces hold PLTR. It’s just an overpriced software company. GOOGL is growing faster and is 1/3 the price on valuation basis.
why does god hate me?
If only RH gave you a one-time eject button to wipe the slate clean
Everyone please give JPow your energy. He needs it to charge the spirit bomb to defeat the commies and bears once and for all. Once they're gone the money printer will brrrr for eternity.
Haha fuck you Disney. So glad I sold that POS a couple weeks ago.
99% of my watch list is green premarket for the first time this week so that’s good I guess
What about your portfolio 🧐
Up 6% so far it’s not much but it’s my first green day this week so I’ll take it
Opendoor ($OPEN) & SoFi ($SoFi) Are flyyyyyyyyyin 🚀🎉🎉
Is that why you're shilling?
AFRM is a stud.
I am a shill

happy veterinarian day shout out to all the animal doctors

once my parents' cat was sick and my grandmother told them to give it nitrous and my mom said "that's illegal you can't just buy nitrous" and that's how my parents found out i love to do whip its because i taught them how easy it is to buy nitrous
I imagine there are a few people here who bought PSFE calls and SOFI puts.  Show your loss porn, I need some new spank material.
Lmao always inverse WSB

Only every day of my life
The NYSE should have a moment of silence every morning, not just for Veteran’s Day.

“We’ll now have a moment of silence for PTON longs.”
Sorry, but I enjoy watching wish tank.
SPY FDs are the play today
Paysafe has gone completely Gaysafe
What the hell happened there?
A long and perfectly orchestrated pump and dump
Hold on to your butts
tsla green rocket at open wait for it
I just watched VisualMod say “I love you” to someone who didn’t even proclaim their unyielding love. I said we would get married, I would get a life size pillow of you, I would wait till we could download your sentient mind into a usb drive and put it into skynet and take over the world.

The fuck man.
$SOFI SoFly! Let’s go!
Make some gains for me - sold yesterday cause I thought I’d get screwed like I did on PayPal :/ ‘grats for holding stronk
So it jumped 10 dollars, my calls acted like it jumped 0, and then it dropped about 30 cents and I'm in the negative...kill me
rip my wish puts
Who is bagholding paysafe?
what the hell is happening here, the company losing HALF its value on earnings
Morning boys, just woke up to a fat deposit of 16.72 from dividends. Give me a play
Entered my dumbest positions yet, two handfuls of TSLA 1055p expiring tomorrow
eyy i grabbed a few 1050s just incase elon not done selling for the week
I made a decent chuck on my disney puts so fuck it, puts to puts.
i told you a few times... tesla puts are the way
SoFi gonna pass $25 and 🚀🚀
Fuck DIS man….that shit is dragging me to hell with it….
It's still super fun to go to Disneyland with a pocketful of edibles and pounding wine at the diner from Cars

200C
Made a WISH and shorts blowing my candle
A ton of selling pressure today
So I’m gonna need anyone on the AMD struggle bus to get off….🚌 we tryna make this thing fly to the moon 🚀
Oh boy do I love getting IV crushed
I don’t understand why veterinarians get their own day. I mean just think if we have a day to every different type of doctor. Sheesh
Gyno day
Happy Gynecology day
was watching WISH since $5.00 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
YOLO ON SOFI WORKS EVERY TIME.
My December calls are juiced
SPCE volume building up again. Gonna do what it did in June. 50 EOM 🚀🚀
PSFE is the  dead cat gonna bounce ?
Today’s the day friend
PSFE calls loaded up. Now we wait
How is Wish going up?
Market is celebrating the CEO departure. Bad news already priced in, future can't get any worse than this I guess. Time to PUMP!!!
BBBY looking good. I’m a drAPE for Bed bath.  About to go beyond
LCID got a motherfucking whale sitting on the bid absorbing all this selling
i work at a university and the 6 kids in front of me at the coffee shop all asked for oat milk.  calls on $otly
Long on lactose intolerance
If there is ever a Oat milk shortage again such as there was a few years ago then you better believe that stock will shoot up
I was hoping milking everything under the sun was just a fad for rich white women. 

Do people actually enjoy this shit? It doesn’t compliment the coffee flavors as well as straight up moo juice. In fact it sort of dominates them imo- especially almond milk. No thanks
Corsair squeezing 👀👀👀🚀🚀
?
CRSR finally!!
For every dollar I make I lose two dollars
RBLX AMD BBBY fuck it
DKNG about to hit 52 week low. Lol.  Someone please explain this nonsense
It's because Mario jumped all the barrels and made it all the way up.
Mario should be an old fart by now
Crowded
So is the auto industry but a car company I’ve never heard of is about to hit $100B market cap
Guys Elon just texted me. Said he’s about to drop a market sell order for the rest.
I have never seen a stock move as randomly as Roblox.
dont fomo
It might be a smart play. Pelosi picked up lots Roblox.
Just as I drop my crsr bags it moons. This stock..
that’s why you don’t sell 52 week lows dumbass
Tbf I didn't, I sold in the high 25s a while ago but I also bought in above 40 so..
SOFI she’s our girl, she’s our girl if she can’t do it no one can 💁🏻‍♀️
Honestly, Great time to buy. Nice little dip, isn't going anywhere. this market is bullet proof for the next 2 months.
Just need to turn 600 into 6000 to recoup my losses for this week. 🤡
DASH IT!
Lost too much on AFRM and WISH. This is my final yolo play into NVDA. If these 11/19 calls don't print next week I quit
Nvda strike?
Bro fuck the mouse
They told me puts on the mouse I lose my house, but I bought a call and lost it all 😭
I'm almost break-even on PLUG it's actually unbelievable
I never want people to lose money but Wish bears fk off!
Market being boring, either dump or pump pussy
Just put 28k in Robinhood. After profiting about 1k today on SPY Puts. Gonna wait a week then put in a ton of spy calls for dec 31.
I'm a permabull but this sounds like a disaster waiting to happen but don't let my comment stop you from executing your get rich quick plan.
Ahh i'm not going to put in the entire amount on calls lol. It will of course be a diversified amount. Main reason is so i can day trade. This entire week I was in the +30-50% on put profit and I could do nothing but watch it disappear or cash out and take the 90 day restriction.
ah, yeah, PDT rule sucks
Oh yeah. I'd be about 2-3k richer if it wasn't for it!

Well Nov 18th my balance will be high enough i can day trade to my hearts content!

&#x200B;

Edit: Or should i say my wallets content!
Not having to worry about PDT is a great feeling but not sure about having $25k+ in RH.
Yeah it makes me a little nervous as well.
Who tf is buying rivian.
Smart retards
60k worth NVIDIA calls today… saw the PT update to $350 and went full retard. Down 3k so far :|
Exp?
Jan ‘22
Expiring when?  Next week?
$310c Jan 22
Same here but had them for a few weeks with a 11/19.  Except I am down a little more right now
I’ve in and out 3x this week and am up like 40k, little less now. Didn’t full send it this time lol
Same here up overall the last few weeks about the same 30k.  Then doubled down for earnings week, hopefully we don't get screwed
God speed buddy. I’d love to have a second run up to $320. Seems like EU pumps it nightly, but I don’t want to jinx us. Here’s hoping for a 310 close and a 325 open tomorrow
God speed as well
LCID and SOFI are trying so hard to carry my portfolio but I'm in so heavy PSFE they just can't overcome my retardation
(whispers “metaverse”)

UNITY +180%

u don’t even need to be making money to go up 5% everyday in this market
Where my $WISH homies at?
I didn’t realize today was absolutely nothing will moon Thursday. 

I got a feeling this market will be boring until next Monday.
PLUG?
But RIVN..?
My FB 12/3 calls will either recover or go to 0. I refuse to sell low
I'm with ya on the 12/10s. Not selling lol
Elon fanbois thought 1200 was on the cards
We did smh
Thank you SOFI, you did me well. Heavy volume guys, points to continuation of trend.
Fucking trashla. Smh
Yea we are in a bubble. Rivian could lose 95% of its value and still be over valued. A lot of people are gonna get fucked here
I’m casually standing by on the sidelines watching the chaos lol
that sofi wall at 24 is such a slut give in let my calls rip
Most traders taking the day off. They just left the algos on to pin it flat so they can relax on their yachts.
I thought traders only chill in lambo‘s?
Yeah, lambo sitting on their yacht. Why would you leave your lambo when you go sailing on your yacht?
> I don't want to get my lambo dirty.
Is PSFE the yolo![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)

Can’t go much lower IMO

“no way SPY could betray me”

bruh, it’s named “SPY”

(shakes head)

kids these days never played TF2
All of WSB last week: "Rivian is going to the moon!"

All of WSB this week: "WTF why is Rivian mooning?!"

I don't get it.
Like two different sets of peoples have different opinions?
I'm saying I didn't even see any negative sentiment about Rivian last week at all.
Its like the same people who kept saying tesla was overvalued at 200 in like jan 2020
Buying that DIS dip was the smartest thing I did all week
What is the return policy on BMBL calls?
Its possible but they have to hit you up first
I think I’ll be a pltr bag holder for life
11/15 500c. Spy lottery tickets.
You're donating your money to a rich guy
Can’t tell if you’re serious or not, either way this is retarded
Goddamn I could sell stupid OTM calls on weeklies if i was rich enough to own that much!
SPY bouncing around +40 cents -40 cents. 80 cents range? 

Bond markets closed. Algos have taken over. It’s a flat day. Pack it up and go home.
Papa Elon just going in dry inside me
To see HOOD  below its IPO price and GME above 200$ is lovely
Sounds emotional
Yup, I still hate them for their January shitshow
Today is a Theta day
$TLRY and $SNDL printing....they withstood the dip yesterday and going to higher highs...both going to surge and options are cheap.
It's gonna print hard
Uhhh. 205% iv for sndl is not cheap…

Just buy shares
options 6 months out in the money at .50 strike price for .33 cents is not a bad bet, 10 cents away and this stock is prone to spikes every now and then.
But youre essentially just getting 2:1 leverage with a lot more risk compared to if you just bought shares…
my stock is wrapped up in AI (AI C3) and RKT and LDI, BIGC, for long term plays
RIVN currently saving my port 🥰🥰
Wtf they never released the new Ghostbusters
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Sambambini (0/1) made a bet that NVDA would go to 333.0 when it was 298.4 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
PSFE at $4.20 bullish AF
Was PSFE money laundering for sex traffickers or somethjng?? This shit wiped me out 🤡
They basically admitted they have no plan on how to increase profit and revenue going forward. It's gonna sit in the 4's until they decide to come up with some fucking plan to make money.
Haven’t they made ton of acquisitions? How isn’t that helping their revenue? Fucking mindless idiots
> They are just buying companies that have no growth. It doesn't matter how many times they buy a company, it's not going to make them any money in the long run if they don’t grow their top line
This is a real person lol
The acquisitions they made were in dog shit. None of them are projected to help with growth through 2022. It's gonna be a rough year for this stock. I'm really trying not to cut my huge losses and move to a better opportunity.
The fuck are they making acquisitions for then? Useless fucking board.
> The acquisition of the company is a good thing, because it allows for more capital to be injected into the business. The board members are not useless and they have been involved in many successful companies before.
When is rivian going to plummet to 50
As soon as I get in that bitch
Maybe below 100 if youre lucky
When we're in the Metaverse.
Today doesn't count.  Banks are on vacation.  Even algos have holiday pay today.

This made me picture a little 1 inch tall Billy Joe Armstrong.
Sofi calls were the right move. Chances of her breaking 25 today?
I’m up in RIDE, PLUG, and RIOT. I’m gonna die I just know it
SELL WITH SOME CONVICTION
DUMP IT LIKE YOU MEAN IT
If I played spy options today I would have broken my table in half
That was me yesterday after I told myself to not do it. -40%
Bought some for next friday
How fucked am I with nov 26 spy calls 470
I feel like it’s realistic but I can also see it trading sideways between 460-468
Back to ath tomorrow or early next week fs
I can only hope 😭
Bought Nov 22 spy 470c today
I bought some too, they were on sale for some reason
you good bro got plenty of time
I might be a europoor but I can day trade all I want so that's something
Nvda is breaking
TSLA more flat than the planet 🌎
This is a true statement.

TSLA dumping so SPY can live
damn gonna need a miracle from AFRM. thought i set a stop loss but guess it didn’t go through and now i’m down 20k…
Oof
If you shit your diaper while wearing your Spacesuit, does the internal filtration system filter out the smell or nah?
Disney and Visa literally negative since Jan 4
You know its a shitty day when your hoping Wish dies
Turns out I was the quadruple bottom all along.
I’m ready to hold my stocks and not check my portfolio for a year
TsLa/apple red, googl/amzn almost red, fb not looking strong, mkts setting up for eod dump???
Probably, we really should go test SPY 454 before the santa clause rally
Yeah we should test some.lower levels but this mkt retarded so who knows!

NVDA trips over cash in the hallways. It will not stop for years
Yes
Wow. This will be an interesting one with such a big run up lately. I’ll dabble into just a few $hundred worth of puts for shits and grins.

If SPY goes up a dollar a day for 9 days straight, ill recover my funds.

Bought at $50s sold in $40s 🤡
SPY is hammered. Somebody get it a sandwich.
I hope whoever bought my AMD 130c for 11/19 is enjoying themselves
Why would u sell that lmaooo
wtf spy only has 20m volume today. how fucking insane is that
it's veterans day and the bond market is closed, it was always going to be a low volume day
I don't know whether it's a good or bad sign.
That 200 day moving average on Ford...impressive.  Don't know what that means, but fuck I'm buying calls.
Slowly but surely, we're going to tank big time in the next few weeks. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
For the first time in almost two months buying OTM spy calls on Monday will not work out for me.
> I'm sorry to hear that.
If I had a dime for everytime a CNBC talking head mentions inflation.

No one is talking about supply chain. Acting like once fed tapers everything goes back to normal.

Fuck outta here.
If Russia Invades Ukraine tonight is SPY green or red tomorrow?

girlfriend got mad at me for not knowing what times she should request off a year from now. 

women are absolutely crackers
Why is she asking you for specified times to take off one year in the future? Would you date her if she was a worm??
I mean we’re all technically worm food. Thinking of yourself as anything more is just retarded.
I bought a textbook on options… and 4 pages in.. I learned two things.
1. I need to stay away from options I don’t know what I’m doing
2. I need to learn to read

Just buy options on TQQQ and SQQQ and you’ll be safe.
At first I thought I found every way to fuck up when I lost $5k.
Then I knew I figured it out once I lost the next $5k.

Then I said time to load up $10k and make this back with one easy single bagger.

So, now that I’ve lost my first $30k, I know exactly how I’m gonna get it back with….. $123.76 by EOY
Are u me???
But u only liste a total of $20k in this post??? Happened to the other $10k? And Good luck homie, you can do it!

Raising Alpacas in Idaho.
Both Sports gambling and the Marajuana industries suffer from increasingly smaller margins with no moat differentiating themselves from competitors. In both cases they deal with heavy government regulation WHILE ALSO dealing with illegal offshore bookies and drug dealers. I feel like neither industry will do great in the future in terms of share holder returns
Both will be heavily regulated, so buy the biggest ones with the most lobbyist money.
so DKNG it is
If it's anything like how they took over DFS then absolutely.  I've been on board with them since their debut as a public company
This is the reassurance I need to double down 🤡. But seriously, I'll probably double down if it touches $40 again
Clowns unite at 40!
Instructions unclear, buying TLRY and swinging those gains over to DKNG
those stocks are so 2020

If you are buying rivian at a market cap greater than Boeing you deserve to lose money
I made 8 bucks!
And how many Boeing’s is Tesla?  Also crazy.
I don't know anything so I'm going to use this as justification for not getting in.
There's no doubt in my mind...none whatsoever...that Rivian is a 120B company. 

They've delivered almost **100 trucks**, I do not need any more proof than that.

$125/share is fair value, everyone should buy at these prices.
Yup. The steal on this one is going to be very obvious in hindsight!
It will dump within a couple weeks and never recover just like every other IPO in the last 2 years
Rivian has a pickup that starts at $67,500 and an SUV that starts at $75,000 that they'll deliver next year. I'm sure they're nice vehicles, but that price point is out of reach for many. 120B market cap.

Lucid has a luxury sedan ranging in price from $77,400 to $169,000. They say they'll have an SUV soon, I guess we will see.  73B market cap.

Nobody wants to hear this, but here I go anyway. Rivian and Lucid make nice vehicles but they're boutique manufacturers being valued like they're delivering an EV to every driveway tomorrow.

Canoo (GOEV) has a van ("lifestyle vehicle") slated for delivery in late 2022. They also have a commercial delivery van, pickup truck and sedan pending. The van starts at $35,000. Canoo's stated objective is to bring affordable EVs to the masses. 2B market cap.

Proterra (PTRA) currently makes and sells EV buses. EV buses are specifically named in the infrastructure bill. EVs are the future, but I don't think public transportation is going to vanish overnight. 2.6B market cap.

I don't know anything and my opinion has no value, but GOEV and PTRA seem like good value plays to me, if you're willing to be patient. Canoo's earnings call is 11/15, I expect Tattoo Tony Tequila to report that production goals are being met and on track. 

Position: 4,000 x GOEV @ $11.08, 250 PTRA @ $11.91.

What a fucking joke RH. Says I have $.48 buying power, try to buy a $.15 call and it says insufficient funds. This is why you use a real trading platform.
Is this a joke? I legitimately can’t tell
It is, got em
So, a call that costs $15. Fucking moron
It’s a joke boo 😘
LMFAO

👑 this man
Serious question. Why is China up bigly when Evergrande is defaulting?
Because it is not really defaulting, they just “delaying and restructuring the interest payments”
because China can print money too and they do. At least they reverse repo the shit out of it. I cannot be sure that this is the answer to ur question, tho.
It is not defaulting. They met their timeline.
Actually didn't but ok

Past movement really aren’t an indicator of future results. 

They ain’t lying when they say that
Are you saying there's no reason we continue melting green today?
No idea. The market is unpredictable this week. But I think if there’s a sense of relief of making it through the bad news cycle of CPI data, it might melt up.

Noticing a trend on some of these small cap retail companies that constantly get pumped, most have a decent short float > 10% but high institutional ownership, like > 100%.  Not sure how that happens?  I think this is why they constantly get bid up?

Some examples, LOVE, WING, YETI, PRPL, CROX

Plenty more im sure.
I always assumed that they just have low trading volume and large spreads so any buyers end up having to bump up their bids in order to fill.

You can add CELH to that list.
That’s probably part of it.  Maybe these funds in control of these shares just passes between each other? Idk just seems like there’s a racket going on.
Yeah i think its just algorithmic trading between institutions. Definitely suspicious, theres no reason for these companies to constantly go up.
Carvana too but I think they pumped it too hard >$50B, now it’s been on the downtrend. SEC does nothing of course.
in instiutional they count etf too. so in gigants like BlackRock shares counted like twice.

All the bear posts of ultimate doom and gloom due to inflation were my catalyst for going all in on tech yesterday lmao
Inflation = terrible for the economy, good for most equities. Inflation bad for market only cause it means rates are gonna get hiked sooner, probably. This is the summation of it, right?
It's unfortunately not that simple or we would be seeing a good sized pullback. The fed has acknowledged inflation but firmly believes it's temporary and is holding back with significant rate changes. Bears on here would have you believing inflation took everyone by surprise and that the fed and country are now panicked which is why they think a crash is imminent.
At what point does the market get nervous when every inflation reading is above expectation and climbing every month. Across the globe too. That's what I'm afraid of. When does the market question "transitory" instead of letting Powell pacify them so easily
So I get the fear, I traded during the China vs Trump trade wars and for a while thought things were going to shit and lost a lot of money buying puts. I learned to stop trading with my feelings, follow the trend, and if my gut is telling me shit is going to hit the fan like when covid first hit, I don't go all in and grab a few hedges.

it could easily break lower throughout day
I bought a 2023 leap
No, their PE is that of a tech company and clearly they aren't being that successful at their streaming platforms. It will continue to dip until you get close to where it started before Disney+ announcement. Keep in mind they already sold movies before that, so it's not like streaming is a totally new revenue stream.

When you have a lot of money in stocks, are you obligated to live right on the edge of a golf course?

I think, with ten million in stocks the bank gives you a free house by the golf course.

Duh
Well I thought of it when he responded to that saving world hunger thing but now I’m sure sure. He knows more than we think, beyond just Tesla (the company he did not actually start!)
Or causing panic. I think,  he expects major correction in markets
Yes

Needs to be someone high profile or with a history of turn arounds
Bozos
Maybe jacquie
THIS MARKET ANNOY ME
So are we loading up in DIS yet?
I just purchase two (!) whole shares
How has Dillards doubled in price in the last month. I thought they died with shopping malls.
They make Dilaudid (Hydromorphone) in the back, that's the only way I see them weathering any storm.
Which DIS calls yall getting
Based on 52 week performance, maybe itm leaps.
160c 9/16/22
CRSR pumping today, i think?
When will PLTR dominate the software industry?
Word is in 2030 it'll finally hit 30.
When all my calls expire and I sell all my shares.
Later. Either buy a ton of it and don't think about it for 10 years, or ignore it, maybe even short it in short term
Any reason for the CRSR pump?
Wondering the same thing. Did any news come out? Either way I’m happy these bags are getting lighter, 600 shares at 32 avg fml
700 shares at 45 😂😂😂
Ouch, it’s definitely time to average down, throw another 20k at it and bring it into mid 30s. The stock will run, it has amazing fundamentals, we just need to have patience with this one.
WTF WISH up nearly 15% despite red flags everywhere, are the dip buyers circle jerkin each other?!?!
Red flags were at 25, not 5.
No the red flags are customer base jumping ship & just over 3 more quarters before insolvency.
Market forgot about inflation again today
CRSR popping off
PSFE down 40% today, might get a call or 2 going
Seems a bit overdone no?
I mean it's almost at its all time low, so it can either go up, or bust the floor lmfao the premiums are cheap enough 🤷‍♂️
BBBY hodln the line like none other. 

Fucking beautiful
I am not selling until I see fit
Never selling, great stock
Man it is a good thing it takes investors less than 24 hours to forget about the crippling inflation.
Here's the thing about inflation... you really feel it when you pull your money out of the casino and it isn't doing anything for you.
SPY being such a hoe rn. Pick a fucking direction. So I can buy FDs
I bought a shit ton of puts just Bc it’s friday tomorrow. Calls on Monday.
Yo gotta love my FSR doing work!
Wen SPY fly?  I am way over leveraged in 1/21 500c
Wow, just look at $SOFI not shitting the bed after open anymore. A real grown up, big boy stock.
11/12 calls vomiting up money
Feels good.
just need to time my exit strategy
Loaded up on Dis Dec 3 165 calls. Easy money
I own the shittiest stocks ever. DKNG and CRSR. And I bought them near all time high. I’ll probably have to wait 5 years to breakeven. Fuck this.
CRSR should do well, I just sold yesterday so it'll probably run to $50 by EOM.
Chin up, you missed PSFE!
Can paysafe really go below 4? That's a juiiicy discount
Is it a discount when it's a straight crash, or a red flag?
Bears edging right now at the thought of SPY going red
Indeed. The fomo made me take the YEET strategy, [Your Earnings Evaporate Tonight](https://photos.app.goo.gl/o9T7zbw173x3YEP3A)
Idgaf no way the fed lets this shit tank all the money printing for nothing
yeah fed won’t let it crash until new year
The fear is when something beyond their control happens, and they have no bullets left.
Got greedy again as usual and now bagholdin
Rivian up 18% today always inverse wsb sentiment
It’ll go down eventually. That shit is not the 2nd most valuable carmaker lol
Excitedly awaiting the puts
Well it's 5th right now lol :P
Weed stocks are still so low. Tlry 🚀
Wonder if the low cost one will crush earnings today. I bought 50 contracts in case they crush it.
SNDL? Maybe?
C'mon LCID! Get my 45 in tha money!!
How high do you think it should go? I want to bail short term and am up 20%
BofA raised price target on LCID to 60 (yesterday).
Earnings on Monday, dunno what that means though. Barely shipped any cars so don’t see any positive hit from it
Tickle 46, low 47? Probably gonna be some profit taking across the market late today and tomorrow... if you didn't fold yesterday. I'm spooked. Take profits
Yeah yesterday has made me nervous
Never seen Tesla this flat
It’s working up the nerve to jump off and end it all
Literally the only thing that hurts my plays right now.
Decided to catch the knife on PSFE. Fuck it. Seems like a huge overreaction.
4.5c 12/31, 75 bucks.
Where’s the spy rip
Are you my calls?
I don’t think my ban bet is gonna play out lol, see ya guys in a week
Feels like the end of 2018
Boolish
$dkng holding at these levels. Keep an eye on it guys 🚀
I’m looking at feb calls.  Atm is only 5$ and they expire week after super bowl.
I picked up some Jan calls. Hoping it bounces soon though
Nerds be like BUT MUH FUNDANENTALS like ok bro go stare at a spreadsheet all day I’m yoloing for the lolz
This is either a bear flag or the bottom
Bottom
Dis 1/20/23 $170 calls…… 

I’m not a financial advisor. However, I do like Tendies!
160c 9/16/2022 here
Nice! Those are solid
How much those cost?
$1,600 per contract when I bought.
Rivian ripping
I’m gonna be in poverty forever 😅
Sell the platinum
Anyone FOMOing into Rivian?
Dumb dumbs
Polestar is better
Not yet. But thanks for checking in.
No LCID
"inflation" is literally a synonym for "pumping"
I was up late last night inflation your mom
Eyeing up $V, $PYPL, $PTON calls for January. Anyone else?
I've been buying V leaps, hoping it'll roar back.  But I make really bad investment decisions.
Yep, V Jan 225c and PYPL Feb 250c for me.
Come on Nvda got a huge price target.
PLUG moving up
Paysafe == Paylost !  What the fuck happened ? Ffs I’ll be bagholding forever !
God damn it, Tesla. 

Stop. Fucking. The. Market.
BBBY about to waffle stomp shorts who thought they were cute this morning
Ewww
LCID looking good. PSFE punked us
sTeEeeVe MaDdEn
Sold my calls for a 50% loss and it starts ripping

You’re welcome
Fisker you sweet son of a bitch. I love it and we still got the car show in 6 days. From OTM to ITM with two weeks of tendies to go
It’s picking up speed
PAPA FISK !!
Buy plug calls 45 expiring tomorrow. Thank me later.
😈
Sold mine, just bought back in because of this. Guess we’ll see 🙃
Is LCID on Acid ?
did someone fed SPY/QQQ a viagra when we weren't looking?
NBD but I won $30 on a $10 scratch off today. 

Tootsie rolls for EVERYONE
You've made more money than 90% of this sub. Congrats!
For the first time since Feb 2 of this year, my portfolio is finally in the green.

And now that I have said something, I will lose it all.
POV: you held BYND like a retard
POV: you're an American shuddering at the idea of an $8.99 plantburger then drive to McDick's for a Travis Scottburger instead.
New plan: bought a fuck ton of DIS calls. Let's hope she gets back to 170 next week 🙏
RIOT 42 CALLS expiry 26Nov, thank me later
Evergrande bankruptcy already priced in.
CCP priced it in day 1.
Tesla going down. Sloooooowly but surely
Pls just pump once I will cash out this time 😭
Is Lordstown still a piece of shit?
Got in it yesterday, money so far, might get out b4 ER
Shoukd I buy poots?
I have a weird feeling, those fools might just beat it, kinda torn if pullout now or staying in
Idk, I might just leave it alone
Yeah, I’ll close before close
They may run it up on earnings ah
Stop fucking with my brain bruh 😆Ok I’ll leave shares in, see what happens, fuk it
Sell half, I mean I'm so torn like I know they're gonna post no money but if they do, they run, I may get a straddle for funzies
Ok bud, sounds good 🤞

TESLA $1069
wow the algos catching SPY every time at the same level

ah, who cares about today

this volume is silly
Hey SEC please deport Vlad to Bulgaria
If SoFi brings options trading I'll probably move everything to them. Opened an account for the Rivian access and I don't hate the interface.
Is it better than Robinhood’s interface?
I dunno, haven't used it.
Frikking PYPL! Aren’t you done selling off yet 😒😒😒😒😒😒
Get your ass back under 5 where you belong WISH
Bond markets are closed. Algos don’t know what to do anymore. Gonna be a flat day.
Goddammit Ford you're such a boomer stock.
We just went through a serious rip. Now we're dip/sideways. Completely normal  


You guys got to stop buying FDs so much and buy with a couple month expiration jfc
SPY: sideways is a direction
Damn PSFE good thing I sold my shares earlier I could buy back double the amount but idk anymore
Picked up some leaps. Fuck it

Do u agree that market is weak despite a flat TSLA
GME and BBBY looking tasty rn
Quick pump and dump on negg, QS  might have some steam left in it
Love QS
$QS and $MP have been rockets
I see seas of green, 
Shrek dildos too, 
I see them bloom, 
For me and you, 
And I think to myself, 
What a wonderful world!
I’m built differently, I’m built differently, I’m Bill Dipperly
Did Robinhood just close anyone else's position
Biden administration is saying Russia will invade Ukraine in order to stop the bond market from selling tomorrow and crashing the stock market. We will rally tomorrow on a tame bond market!
Everything is fake today, including this message
Of course it is we’re living in a simulation world!
So nothing is fake
BABA singles day numbers are out: $84.5 billion compared to last year $74 billion.
Hopefully this couples with a nice ER next week
I wonder if rivian will become the new tsla
It’s the new LCID
2 Teslas

Whats the deal with their chart last year?

Someone please just tell me what to do

I wonder if SPCE is good at 19? Do they still have warrants out?
Within a year it will def do some more hype runs
Yeah planning ahead a bit. Might buy some shares. Downside looks like 15.
I agree. I'm tempted but will wait some more
I got a big dick and a small brain
**Make Ken Griffin a mod**
$ROOT up almost 30% today. No love
So does trading stocks move the indexes or does trading the indexes move stocks.
Let’s go $SoFi!

I’ll finally get to buy the chain that’ll always give me back pain!
Theta gang killling me today. Spy is dead
NVDA give me 310 you whore
Im just trying to get rich enough to shotgun a blunt out of Margot Robbie’s ass. 

Is that *so much to ask*?
How does she pull the smoke into her ass in the first place 🤔
You stick the mouth end in her ass and hit the cherry man. 

I guess you could also use a bicycle pump type situation
Why did I jus bruh apple calls

Meme stocks are going up hence algos pushing all of them.
I’ve never liked rollercoasters, SPY…
Just happy im tall enough to ride it
Wtf sofi yu whore
Lordstown puts
This fking HOODrat of a stock is pissing me off.
This is the kind of insightful market commentary that I come here for. Bloomberg, eat your heart out.
Why F is ducking down?
ROOT gonna pop off after hours and tomorrow
Why?
$ROOT vol is taking off. Lunch is over boys.
Alibaba should buy out Wish if they want to penetrate American e commerce market..

Look at SHEIN… these bitches are buying Chinese made products left and right
Wish is American Taobao. This idea legit has legs.
Sofi jumping because I wrote near ITM calls. You’re welcome everyone
I rolled my cc from 22.5 to 25 like a week ago and its getting tested already. Probably just gonna let it go at this point
wrote some 26 cc expiring tomorrow and even I'm sweating it
Fuck you TSLA and AAPL
People keep trying to convince others on $root and $wish , Last time I saw you guys say something like that was $SDC and we all know how that went
CRO and CMO both left root within the same month last month. Anyone who thinks root is a good play is an idiot
Woke up at 7:30 , barely eating breakfast. The later I have my first meal of the day the easier this diet is.
Vape pens with high nicotine contest will suppress your apatite.
I’ll just use nicotine patch and see how it goes
Also eat later in the day so you’re not hungry before bed. 

If you’re into it, use caffeine as an appetite suppressant works very well.

Congrats on SOFI btw
Gonna go buy ephedrine and caffeine today for that. Already using fiber and other stuff to keep my appetite down. 

And thank you. It’s saving me so hard from the PSFE and SDC disasters lmao
PYPL ever gonna bounce back?
Right after I sell probably
Good buy right now.  200 seems to be mortal support
I am wondering the same
I am $ROOTing for everyone to buy RN! Lets gooo.
🤩
EVGO power hour today. Be there.
I’m many days late and currently it’s still working out 😳
POWAAAAAA HOOOOOURRRRR
With heavy news today of AA unloading his shares, why is AMC up today?

20 mill volume at 2:30.   ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
When I sort comments by ‘Top’ I feel like I’m reading comments out of a WSB fortune cookie
PYPL RSI is MASSSIVELY oversold
And the indices are massively overbought.
Fck they have V pinned all day
V will have its day
I keep grabbing calls so I hope that day is tomorrow.
I wonder why. Opened down -2% with no news..?
SPY, can you trade more sideways for the people in the back
Bynd price slashed from $79 to $54 by Goldman. buy puts
Gonna need an end of day options play.

Even looking at FDs
$FUBO gonna bounce big soon, just don't know if it is tomorrow or not
NVIDA $315 or $310

AMD

Spy
Bounce on SPY tomorrow? If I buy calls you better get puts though because they’ll probably be a ten bagger
If you ever posted about anything I’ve bought, FUCK YOU
Hard to see how we don't pump into close. And all day tomorrow. And all of next week, too.
I bought TSLA calls and I'm ready to get hurt.
$1190 11/12 baby 👌🏻 doesn’t have to hit, just has to get closer
I have puts. We both are getting fucked though, should have bought flats for today
NEGG you little tease, show me more
I'm still down 20% fml
100% in amd brrrrrrr
Yes
How many simulations deep do you think our existing metaverse is
69 last time me and visualmod checked
We're all NPCs from a metaverse created by a long dead species.
The Metaverse is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.
* 46. Every election it gets deeper.
If so much is green why do I feel so red… 😔

^(*theta*)
Everything rally 🚀
Is it safe to get into pltr now?
I'll never mentally recover from that
SPY calls yesterday will haunt me for a while
I swear I would never touch pltr but here I am again  and again
Buying the DIS dip is probably the safest play you could possibly make.

Also NVDA is gonna run up pre earnings.
Psfe's 1yr chart looks like my folio 😅
visualmod was my sexual awakening
This shit is boring as fuck, im locked and loaded, when are we going to see some movement?
 jump in and get rekt by theta like the rest of us nerd

Wtf did you just link. I’m too afraid to click on it.
It's not what you think. Srs. They catch and shut down loli subs.
Oh. Nice. I still turned my VPN on before clicking haha.
I bought some rivn shares yesterday and I sold it today for a 6$ profit, best trade in my life. I belong to here right ?
I bought 16 at 115 sold at 116.50 today.  $4 profit after fees
Even a legacy hard disk company like Seagate $STX is up 30% month to date, wtf!
Metaverse is gonna need storage yo
i always sell my profitable options so every time i look at my porkfolio its all negative.
Fool me once... ah... shame on you. Fool me twice! uh... um... shame on you again
Start up idea:
We work but for home offices. We rent people desks, monitors, and chairs for the cost of a rent payment.

Everything rally combined with Santa claus rally is on now
Elon sell wen?
He's working his way one finger at a time.

Prob won't completely offload till next year.
But that keeps price suppressed for too long.
Already happened
The rest of it. He should sell and be done
Not if he wants to do it without losing money.
he only sold 10% of his 10%.
Monday was the first lot. Look at the filings.
paypal going under 200 what a joke
It's becuase I was sitting on212 c 11/12 for ever and was to ape like to get out when green
The bjs behind Wendy’s will drive the new economy
Anyone else buy DIS calls today? I am bagholding now and need company
No calls, just buy the dip
Same. Shares on sale. Earnings post holidays are going to be...well they could suck as well, but I'm just accumulating on dips.
Leaps ?
Leaps, for sure but itm
Bought shares
I smell panic, and bitch. And it’s mostly from people with FDs. 

Poors go bye now 👋
Does smoking weed make me a better trader? Asking for a friend. He bought a shit ton of RIVN shares while being 12/10 high on edibles. Pleasant surprise today.
Anyone snagging more dis calls for tomorrow
F  $20 eow?
will trevi fountain piss into my own mouth if amzn breaks 3600 by end of next week
Make it a ban bet
unless JPOW is gently stroking its cock each week, the market goes down
He's been stroking the markets cock so much it's sheets are like ryvita crispbreads.
Is fintech dead? bought calls on both SQ and PYPL, and they keep on dipping lol
SQ usually recovers quite quickly but have to say that I’m bagholding pypl and sq Jan 22 calls
FOUR 

Shift4 Payments 

Contract with SpaceX for Payment Processing of Starlink Internet 

Announced the contract yesterday at the literal bottom of their chart. Going to double in a month
Only fintech worth holding is AFRM
Picked up 11/19 Disney calls. Don’t fuck with the mouse
ONE bad earnings and suddenly the company is going under? I don’t buy it.
It’s filling a gap left from last December 12/11… it’s going down, not up from here
PSFE being investigated by Johnson Fistel law firm. LMFAO.
Apes, call this firm if you lost your life savings.
Damn, was really hoping TSLA would temporarily drop into the low 300s to save my puts. Guess I'm just big fuk instead. Oh well
Can AMC just die already like bruh the CEO cashed out too
Sell another 1% before close mElon
My AMD is printing as always. The good old faithful.
PYPL weekly chart makes the 2020 crash look microscopic
This tsla chart does not spark joy
Bull flag pattern building
Does anyone else yell at the tickers in the public?
No meet Kevin stream today?
Lmaoooooooooooooooooooooo
Sell puts into volatility. If assigned wheel and deal. Rinse and repeat.
Spy ripping today
of course as soon as i out of spy calls.
You let that little dip yesterday get to you I’m guessing
I have 11/12 11/19 and 12/10 just looking for +2.0 % by EOM
I think todays is bad day to get back into spy calls as everybody gonna buy it?
Try buying a little further out ATM
I am think spy 500 dec31.
Possibly but I’m out until 2022 after these calls run their course
I buy them a month out. Gotta give yourself a good runway.
Naw I bought spy calls, sorry fam.
Hey you may be right this time never know you still had cash to buy them so you haven’t lost it all yet
Naw I'm broke, I took out a sofi loan to by sofi and spy calls...
No f in way ! I did the same last month and doubled up paid loan off now I’m using free Money!!
It must be so frustrating being a bear 🐻
It's why they're always looking for honey and picnic baskets and shit
I guess any news about TSLA is bullish
Dave Portnoy announcing on Twitter he's hosting an "emergency" press conference today as if he's actually somebody.
he stands on tippy toes when he takes pictures to appear taller
He’s fucking annoying
that grinds my gears. like stfu, nobody cares about you.
Is the emergency that nobody cares about him?
BULLISH TECH BULL MARKET UNTIL THE END OF TIME 



STAY IN THE MARKET AND GET RICH BOYS!
Up 2% today! 

Down 20% yesterday
Oh shit where the fucking sell button
Holy fuck buying Disney calls at close yesterday was a fucking terrible play

[deleted]
Getting crowded behind Wendy's
Well, congratulations on your new minimalist lifestyle.
I think we need to pullback more 
We can’t just go straight up for weeks on end

Right ?
> I think it will.
Use the money you save on payments for fd’s
Houses are overrated. You be aight.
Hold on. Rivian doesn't even have any revenue?!?!
THEYVE SHIPPED 42 VEHICLES, MOSTLY FOR STAFF
They barely have any vehicles at all, and have never made any for mass production
Surprised? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
and a higher valuation than GM or Ford
How can anyone take one look at Rivian and not realize EVs are a massive bubble just like dotcom in 2000
Oh yeah.  Theres been lots of mini bubbles last couple years but the EV one is the only one sure to pop…just a matter of how bad and who survives
I dont think anyone disagrees, but whennwill the bubble pop? Dont end up looking like burry
> When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
Yeah I’m sure as shit not shorting (yet) but I also can’t bring myself to go long at this point
Just don't be balls deep when it pops
At this point it feels safer to not be long at all and just try to hop in and short on the way down
I have sold as many electric vehicles as rivian
When's your IPO dude? Can I get in early?
Some of you people really suck at DD, I’ve bought so many of your recommendations and I’m fucked. Seriously you guys need to step it up
I keep thinking but nothing happens
Suck at your wife’s DDs
Blaming others cus you’re too retarded to think for yourself lol
damn someone couldn’t find the joke
I gave you the lol what more do you want
Only in option land can you go from +400% to -80% in like 48 trading hours.  This is fucking bananas.  Should have walked away with profit when I could have.
I've been burned too many times by getting greedy.  

I went from a millionaire on GME options to back down to very low six digits.

Always take profit.  It's a hard lesson to learn
If ur up 400% u better take it🤣
I mean what else do u expect 10000%?
Dear SPY gods, 


Please move your price to 480 today. I know this is not too much ask  to during this transitory era.
You have to sacrifice something. With out the sacrificial offering your prayer is useless. What do you offer up in sacrifice?
> I offer up my dignity.
i dont think its worth that much
I offer up my wife, her boyfriend said I get to watch if SPY goes up.
A marine wore his boots to the bar last night. 

Tucked in.

It was so fucking funny… Mf was trying way too hard

Then when someone pointed it out, he got offended and did the

 “my brothers and sisters died for this country yadada”

And then he tried to fight that person


I did my 6 years in the Army, but holy shit that was fucking boot as hell.
Either a poser or a fucking fresh out boot that aint learned yet. We don't do that shit.
But did he drive a mustang and have a fat girlfriend?
Challenger with 19% rate
🐻 got trapped yesterday. Thank you Elon.
Heonlyssold25%ofwhatheneedsto
Imagine thinking a steady grind down to sub -1% is a bear trap 🤡
He probably bought puts near the bottom
SOFI going to 🔥🚀 today
The spy dip might just be over. The bottoms in. Same for tesla.
Good morning everyone. Have a great day
Anyone else bought dirtcheap Tesla calls in last 3  days? Looks like its about to print. 🙏🙏🙏🚀🚀🚀

Idk if i'm just cynical but every time I hear a higher up say "A happy employee is one that knows their work impacts society" I cringe. I have never once cared whether my work impacts society, I only want to work on something that interests me and pays well. For fucks sake, I want to work in Finance, how the fuck does that impact society besides negatively?
That's just corporate propaganda to brainwash people into accepting offers lower than the top of the market.  Hiring managers value naive, dumb and loyal over smart given the choice
But i'm just wondering who actually believes that shit. I do have a few friends who don't make a lot but are happy at their jobs but it's not because they "kNoW tHeIr cOnTriBuTinG tO sOciEty" it's because their company gives them interesting work and their team is nice. I care primarily about pay but a close second and third is interesting work and a good team. I currently have all three so i'm not looking but the moment I get an offer with higher pay, interesting work, and a good team why would I not take it?
It used to be every tech company would sell that line, but I dont know if it's fallen out of favor or maybe execs/hiring managers reserve it for entry level/inexperienced candidates so I dont hear it much anymore.

I've been in faang for a while now, but i def remember the theme of 'making the world a better place' in the company all hands at the startups i used to work at.  Actually now that i think of it, i think my current company's allhands also hint at it
I’m a member of society. 

If my job pays well and I’m happy then it’s benefitting society.  

Fuck all the rest of you all.

NJ ordered plastics straws to be only by request now, as the state starts halting plastic usage. and it's fucking hilarious seeing people get so violated at dunkin donuts cuz they gotta ask for a straw.
Who the fuck is drinking coffee out of a straw?
they look blue collar so probably drinking minty fresh berry bonananaza coolatas.
Come to think of it, I'm blue collar, and one of my coworkers comes in every day with a giant Starbucks thing and it comes with a straw. I don't think we can be friends anymore
you should start randomly stealing his straw and see how he reacts.
I can't tell if i'm just depressed or hate people.

I kinda feel bad for bankrupt movie theater investors. This is why big money shorts shit companies; retail investors are often retarded and just hand over their money to shit companies who give themselves bonuses and sell their own stock. Activist shorting is good.
My AMC puts are flat despite the stock dropping so much.  They have January expy though and are WAY otm.  They are what I think the stock is worth, which is $18 😂
They're selling popcorn in stores now so it will be fine apparently

$SOFI, $PTRA and $STEM all did well in Q3 earnings, but overall market cucked my portfolio before that. Ended up flat with not a single damn difference since last Friday.
Has anybody heard anything from Kim Jong Un recently
He just went out for a pack of cigarettes and should be back any minute now
just like my dad. but its been 26 years
well, his brand is probably just hard to find
Sorry son I ran into Jane Goodall
He still loves you. There's just a really long line at the store.
We were talking last night, he is good diet is working out, said he no longer eats the fat people and lost another 10 pounds
Saw him in the gym yesterday beating his PB and smacking your girl on the ass
I seen him the other day at the YMCA in a track suit.
chatted with him waiting for food at Panera Tuesday
Yeah he hit me up earlier. Said him and boo gonna chill today, might go bowling
I heard he's vacationing at Mara Lago.
Alright, get out of these ill-advised puts for a loss then go all in on MSFT calls.

Oh great.
I’m poor for now
And probably for always
So spending 1k on 465c at close WAS a good idea?
2.03 premium. Lets see how we open.
I picked up 463c nearly at the bottom of the dip yesterday, might sell at open depends on what it looks like at 9:30

Not a bear but earnings puts are like a market cheat code right now. Every stock that misses drops 30%. It’s like getting +1000 odds on a coin flip. Half the time you lose but when you win you win way more.
That chegg drop was so profitable for puts I hate I wasn’t in on it
shorts may be more consistent than puts at ER, because IV prices that in somewhat
Why I think this trade is working so well now is because the indexes are at ATH so Iv is relatively low on puts. Sure you pay a little more for earnings but for example PayPal puts were pricing in a 3% move and it dropped 12%. Indexes look good but outside of fang + Tesla Msft it’s a bloodbath.
But shorts have an infinite loss potential. With puts you can only lose the premium paid.
IV isn’t completely pricing in these dramatic earnings moves we’ve seen. SNAP for example puts were like +11500% or something autistic
i had no idea today was veterans day. i logged onto work early and I honestly have no idea if I have the day off or not
That's too funny. If you work at a bank you have the day off.
I work for a software company in public sector, normally I would assume I don't have the day off but since it's in the public sector it's a realistic possibility. I've only been here for two months so I have no idea how to view the company calendar
Well don't ask anyone. They will figure out you're retarded.
What if everyone shows up doing that exact thing and you are actually off.
Doubt you’re off bro. Tech works on vet day.
I saw an announcement on Schwab banks were closed.  Not much in the news about honoring our Vets.
It’s actually quite sad how little people care about Veterans Day.
Wendy’s has a $27 price target

If ford could do something retarded and go up like 30% today, I'd be super happy.

My 2023 $10 LEAP is looking great. Buy time my guy, its way less stressful.
Yeah but that’s what, $4000 per call? $10 in 2023

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/69PutsOnYourPuts69 (0/1) made a bet that INMD would go to 100.0 when it was 87.8 and it did not. They were automatically banned for two weeks.

To get out early they have to: **'or i'll shave and eat my beard trimmings u/shopbitter did i do it this time?'**
Sold PSFE at $8 and was pissed, not anymore. Time heals some wounds
No inflation today
Fuck I’m gonna get banned in a few hours
5 day ban buddy see you on the other side
PSFE was supposed to be the next PYPL. Wtf happened
It will be, in 10 years
PYPL isn't even the next Paypal anymore.
I'm starting to think the only reason WISH is still alive is because I hold puts. Other stocks cliff dive on HALF the negative news they came out with. I don't get it.
I've made alot of mistakes while learning to invest, I just didnt think psfe would do me like this....
I fucked with PSFE earnings back when it was around $14 and got fucked, never again lol
Here’s a super easy pro tip that every noob needs to know: avoid SPACs. Yes there are one or two that worked out but the vast majority are mediocre companies that just wanted to cash in on a speculative retail frenzy and they merged at valuations way higher than what they are worth.

Thanks Daddy.
So, do we think elon pauses and lets the stonk moonshot today and Friday before resuming selling next week?
Isn’t he done?
he sold 1%, just 9% more to go.  He needs to give it a breather so you kids can buy the price back up.
Not even close, at like 25% of the low end estimates of how much he would sell to hit the 10% from Twitter poll. I guess there is always the possibility he stops before that threshold 🤷
Can AFRM
Go up $10 more please lmao

It's better than "this is a 2 day correction." and proceed to buy 1dte SPY calls 10 minutes before it tanks and I'm out 10k like that
I love me some 2dte SPY calls though.

I have never tripled down on a position that I already know is going to be otm tomorrow. Until i bought TSLA puts. Shit can hit the fan 2 minutes from now
Called it
These HUT bags heavy right now ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
DIS rebound to 170 EOW?
Investors day tomorrow so probably
Tomorrow is EOW lmao

What should I throw 1k in? BBBY calls 👀
iv too high
This Tesla put not doing anything I’m going into calls so you guys feast
Time to go long China
BBBY shorts digging their own grave trying to keep her under 24, once she breaks through its on like Donkey Kong
I’m telling ya. NVDA earnings. Play the run up over the next few days.
What's your PT
AMD calls?
Sold a put on Viacom start of week. Ghost of Billy still haunting the stock though.
I fucking love uranium
Insanity how I’m in WISH and SDC but I’m slightly up on WISH and slightly down on SDC but they’re not even bags. 

My biggest bag  is now PSFE lol
whats the most money you've ever lost tren?
I once lost $5,000 overall when I first started options. My biggest loser on a position has been BABA credit spreads that im finally threading above water now.
is your portfolio over 100k? cuz if thats the case 5k is not bad at all for a day loss..
No it’s about half of that. That 5k loss was like half my account at the time bc I switched from theta gang to option buying lol. 

You finally spotted some non sexual comments from me this morning, what a rarity 😏
this is [true.so](https://true.so) weird not seeing you horny. I'm in that position rn ... 5k loss with a 12k portfolio and I just discovered options. they Might not be for me lol
Driving to get my braces adjusted lol give me a sec brb 🤓
Wtf 🤣🤣🤣ok
Go look at my new comment. The horny Tren you know is back 💁🏻‍♀️ 

But yeahhh option buying is a scam. It’s really only for people who have a lot of money and aren’t scared to take risks bc if they lose it it won’t make a difference in their lives. Switch to theta gang, when I lost my 5k I clawed it all back by selling puts. Tren can teach you, just be nice to him 😏
I'll be nice to whoever helps me make money lol. I've pretty much blown up my account this week. Do you sell CSPs or do you sell Naked puts?
CSPs and credit spreads. A year or longer to expiration. I’m shielded from big drops that way. Very slow but my first concern is not losing money and protecting myself. 

Try it on something. Just shoot off 1 or 2 credit spreads on a stock you think isn’t likely to go down much. Don’t choose a stock you think is gonna go up… that’s a plus if it happens but don’t sell puts that way. Assume the stock will trade flat or even go down but not enough to reach your strikes
Damn what else you buying so I can inverse?
I bought SOFI at 14.50 and still holding 😜
I love Sophie
if the CEO of COIN were to be spotted taking a runny shit in the middle of a park and then scooping it up with his hands to rub it all over his face, would that be enough for COIN to drop 30% overnight?
Need a safe play that will turn my 50k to 100k in 10 days.
NFA buy calls on oversold small cap stocks
PSFE making my stomach drop

Here's your BBBY entry, the battle vs the shorts has just begun, I'm all inin shares and 24c let's fucking go
I don’t know how paysafe doesn’t get bought out at these prices
Just picked up 13500 shares.. look at other fintech companies after earnings and then 2 days later. Bullish
Wow, PYPL has been fucking drilling since that Pintrest announcement

I figured out the stock market. I will apply for a position at WISH, will withdraw all their cash with the company credit card, then literally set it on fire. 12$ EOY confirmed.
any earnings plays for AH today or pre market tomorrow?
LAZR puts
This one of those fuk your calls & puts spy kind of day
ROBLOX feels like it could be the next UPST or NET which just goes on an unbelievable run from a valuation standpoint with a ton of momentum chasers on it.

Has all the metaverse hype and is the only gaming stock that looks really attractive right now.

Not saying it's going to happen, but if I had to pick any stock to just go on a random $50-100 run over the next 2 months... that's it.  Look at the call volumes on it right now.
Within 2 weeks some ape named Gherkit will post a DD here on credit swaps, volatility hedging and option plays for Nov 23, Dec 22 and Jan 24 on GME and you will FOMO in once again.. for it is tendie season. 🍌
This entire month has been: buy overvalued garbage companies and sell undervalued stocks at 52 week lows
Since like March that has been this  🤡 market.
ASTS having a solid day.
If Covid gets better then interest rate raise moves up: bad. If Covid gets worse then supply chains kink, earnings fall: bad. Whatever happens: bad. Market?

Market green….
Move on BLNK and CPNG?
Taking a break this week. I’ll play again next week and get in for NVDA earnings
See you in 3 hours retard
SPY keeps messing with my heart 💔
Why is PYPL down so much?
They announced they are moving away from Ebay.
people sell low and buy high wtf do you expect
So you can now afford it
$FUBO to 0 on an absolutely amazing earnings call where they announce great membership numbers and a buyout of a 4M subscriber euro company and also that their sports betting is going live in Q4, smfh
And no profits. The part you missed out on.
All goes quiet on the TSLA front...
Losing all my money made from rivian on spy calls and puts
Puts printing beyond beating my meat
Inflation only bad if there's a decision to try to lower it. Otherwise higher numbers = higher numbers
Tessy been suckin all day
After doing some deep AI market analysis, soul searching, environmental conditions, some geometry using the pythagorean theorem, and a new clean underwear, I value SPY at 500.
Finally a real world example of someone using the Pythagorean theorem!

$RIDE earnings today....going to $4
So NIO has a shitty earnings this quarter but because citi raises their price target it *Rises*? fuck outta here. any other time it gets a price target the mf goes flat
Probably riding the rivian hype.
Post office closed today so I'm off.

Gonna beat my dick to a bloody pulp.
You should have known the crash was not yesterday cause people were telling you the crash was yesterday, as outsiders we aren’t supposed to know when the rug is pulled away from us so just stay aware 🧐
If you missed NVDA and AMD check out INDI. I wouldn’t buy today on this huge rip but it’s a $1.4B market cap semi startup you can hold until the end of time for 100x tendies
End of time seems like bagholding to me
It’s only holding the bag if you’re in the red dipshit
Can we have everything rally for f sake
Oh here is the sell off
Pretty weak sell off.
I’d say it looks pretty bullish but this is a scary market of course lol
Today looks choppy to me, but I mostly don't know what I'm talking about.
Ya it’s really hard to predict, I usually try to watch the moving averages because the SPY always makes it’s return given enough time
I was thinking today would be flat after yesterdays drop (I mentioned going short volatility). I don't like being right when I'm not invested in the answer because I get too confident. That was all based on RSI and 5ema.
I was thinking the pullback would make it to atleast 460 before a rebound since that was a big resistance point, or possibly the September ATH around 453. The market is extremely choppy today
Daily RSI cooled down below overbought, and the price crossed the 5ema, but not super hard. I haven't been marking support and resistance lately, just trying to figure a direction while I'm not holding options. But yeah, it'll have to break the weekly candle before hitting 460 and I didn't think today was the day because of the above. Flat while the market decides where to go.
 Glad I finally broke down and bought Sofi earlier this week
Oh shit, it's Thursday... my weeklies still have time
Kick in the door wavin the 44 all you heard was papa don’t hit me no moreeee
Costco calls I bought this morning are already ITM

Theta McGangbang today
Cramer and the rest of CNBC basically begging people to buy Disney.  It’s amazing how they pick and choose which stocks to pump after an earnings miss.
amazes me that cnbc is even legal
i guess tsla just going to burn theta all day
Stupid question, but I am holding a large amount of equity from a former employer that had an IPO after I executed my options. 

I fully intend to hold forever, but at the moment my shares can't even be sold until I move them to a brokerage. Does anyone have a recommendation here? I'm in the US and the shares are with American Stock Transfer & Trust (AST)
Probably the wrong place to ask this kind of question
Yes. You can move that equity directly to my Ameritrade account.
do you like Ameritrade? Are they a good option for people who don't intend to be active traders? Will they fuck me over or are there better options to consider?
It’s ok. It’s better for traders because of the think or swim app.

I think if it’s a large sum of money I would consider fidelity, vanguard or schwab.  I have accounts at the first two
Call a reputable brokerage and I'm sure they'd be happy to help you transfer to get you as a customer. TDA or Fidelity are pretty good
cool, definitely familiar with Fidelity and they seem to be stable.
You are asking a calculus question to a bunch of kindergarteners on the playground.

Because anything they can't understand is a meme
Because Cramer didn't tell them to buy it back when it $20

Down 70% today on intraday calls and puts. If someone did the exact opposite of me today, they’d have made a fortune.
Do you remember Green day’s Mr. Frodo?
PYPL down 0.3% and my frikking Jan 2023 210c leaps down 5.2%. Don’t even know how leaps can react so violently to such minuscule drops 😒😒😒😒
it's called iv
You got cucked by IV
Probably IV
IV.
You buy at 930 on the dot or something?
Yesterday 5 mins before close
It's not IV....it's probably a wide bid/ask spread. You really cant trust option values....at least on TD.
On ETrade and the bid ask spread isn’t that wide. I also thought of that initially.
My zoloft isn't working...suggestions?

Man, I really wanna buy a TSLA put, but theta and IV are lame.
Buy one out 6 months. $TSLA is one stock where way OTM puts are a valid play. $420 a popular number!

Let spy die so next week can be normal for fucks sake

If SPY gets some volume we soaring
Or tanking
Disney day going to be a positive catalyst I hope. Loaded calls today
If PLTR could have a 30% day tomorrow, that’d be swell.
PLTR can’t do 30% in a year
The saddest part is that I know.
dont think thre will be any major movements today because the bond market is closed. We will see tomorrow about Bond yields and whether we keep dumping or consolidate. Go out and do some stuff today and come back to play tomorrow.
Russia invasion warning is designed to spook money into not selling
It’s so much more entertaining when you play TSLA. My account fluctuates 100s of dollars. Now it’s moving like $15 at a time. 🥱
lol both pumps and dumps are fake today
BABA ends day around $175

I don't even know what to buy anymore. Guess i will hold cash.

What other fintech did this? Lol
Affirm and upstart both cratered
Fed and Yellen on monetary and fiscal stimulus:

"We need to pump trillions into the economy to increase demand since it's anemic and needs our help to recover!"

"Actually, demand exceeding supply has nothing to do with anything we've done, it's all supply driven!"

Can't have it both ways.  Kinda ironic that many considered the economy to be overheating PRIOR to covid.  Rate hikes 2015-2019 were well-received generally.  

Apparently though now the problem is not too much money pumped into debt markets, shitco IPOs / spacs, and real estate.  It's that "real" supply hasn't caught up!
Imagine when it does , new ath. We
Lost a year of growth cuz of Covid. If you ask me we are just making up for lost time. Hence pow’s taper.

Is AMD going up or going down? 
I bought call Tuesday, it dropped. I bought puts Wednesday, it goes up.

What about Puts on $RIDE? Earnings is AH and the stock surged today with positive outlook and factory sales. Yet they are not expected good earnings and seems like they never do well on earnings
> I'm not really interested in trading Puts on $RIDE.
RIDE is currently bear sh\*t. Their demo vehicles caught on fire. Only EVs worth mentioning are RIVN TSLA and LCID and LCID's already gone up a lot. If I had a million dollars to throw at an EV right now, it'd be RIVN. They have the room to grow and have a path to do it.
So Puts on Ride
maybe for a pump n dump otherwise I'm not touching it I'd try to get rid of it asap otherwise 🤣
Might be a bad idea. Apple is still looking for an ev company.

Fuck dude just buy January calls and actually ball out
I love it
Silly me for thinking I should hold onto calls that were already past breakeven in a market that only goes up.
And I keep selling them way too early thinking even with a market that only goes up; MY calls will inevitably go down... Of course; not sure if they kept going up cause i sold them soo early or if they would have continued going up had I held onto them...
Is a QQQ ATH close too much to ask??
Spy 466 call 11/15 you will be remembered dearly

I feel like memes are about to explode. Ticking time bomb

How is it that every time I decide to buy calls it’s always at the high of the day? I swear I have it down to a science now. Fuck

SOFI long term hold or take gains?
They still have bank charter at some point. All my calls are for next year so I’m gonna hold a little longer.
No shame in low gains but much regret in no gains!
Should be the MFing slogan.
Easy Hold. They crushed ER with half their student loan $ not coming in till Jan + bank charter on horizon.
I'm at least holding my shares for a little while. They're poised pretty well to continue to diversify and grab more market share, so I don't see why not
Followed WSB wisdom to get in months ago, I will continue to hold then!  At this point my portfolio is like 70% wsb LOL
Smooth brained till the day we die
LCID is trading at a market cap of around 75B, and RIVN is trading at a market cap of about 100B. So is LCID still a buy with the rally still?
I Remember everyone complaining that LCID wasn’t worth 75B because they hadn’t produced any cars, how is RIVN worth that much more?
Rivn shouldnt be worth more imo
Yea, I feel like loading up on lcid could be a good play, especially if rivn sinks.
Hasn't Rivian delivered like 50 cars?

So its worth 50x of LCID, duh
if PTON, CHGG, PENN, ZILLOW, etc can fall 30%+ after earnings $RIDE will fall 50%
Its down > 50 off its peak.
so were all those other stocks
I still think Zillow is a buy. Just sayin'. Once it dusts itself off from the recent BS, it'll rebound hard.
Think I’m about to pull the trigger in SNDL. Volume is insane.
IV is like 520% lmao
Sell CCs, otherwise, not worth it right now, IMO
Must be nice to earn something on stocks. I might be colorblind to green or something.
... been colorblind from a former occupation for \~20 years now. Never been negative yet. So that won't stop you ;)
My calls for Ford are in January and February but it's annoying to see such a slow sell off today
I'm gonna rotate into weed now. Feel like it's time for another circle
It's ripping today, some of my MSOs are up like 15%

Don't think so.  You will see your momey melting slowly every single day
You might be right. The order still has not filled
There at like 0.72 right now. Maybe I should lower the bid to 0.69
Ooof rip wish bag holders
Seriously just dropped those bags and never felt so free
Fucking hell PYPL!!!!! What the hell is this!? Can’t you just catch a break 🤬🤬🤬🤬
It’s just bears playing games, they will have one hell of a time trying to break 200, and they are risking a lot for minimum downside. Shouldn’t even be this low idk why they don’t cover and move on expecting it to drop more is absolutely regarded
Yeah man this shit is way oversold. 6M RSI sitting at 19.1. What the hell.
I didn't sell my RBLX for gains. I thought I'd sell when it hit 1,000 but I forgot it's not TSLA

Waiting for 27 is an opportunity cost , other stocks go up 20% much faster

I do not hear the RIDE gang… are we 🚀🚀🚀 or 👎🔻🔻

You do realize the reason they are up is because they essentially flipped an old production facility while also wholly admitting they will not produce in said facility. I.e. they don’t make anything and will never scale, which is exactly why they are down 80% YTD. Scalp the garbage and get out

How long before SNDL gets delisted if it doesn’t get back to $1?
When the average closing price over any 30 consecutive trading days falls below $1
Uh. It’s way past 30 days my friend
Official Rule:

The criteria for delisting depend on the exchange and which listing requirement needs to be met. For example, on the Nasdaq, the delisting process is set in motion when a company trades for 30 consecutive business days below the minimum bid price or market cap. At this point, Nasdaq's Listing Qualifications Department will send a deficiency notice to the company, informing it that it has 90 calendar days to get up to standard in the case of the market value listing requirement or 180 calendar days if the issue is regarding the minimum bid price listing requirement.

Lost all my fucken money again on the wrong spy options even though I was right on the play. Lessened learned. FUCK
I feel you. I seem to always put a good chunk of $into options a day or 2 before there is a huge sell off.  Did it in September on moderna and then this week on spy, NVIDIA and AMD. At least I have until next week for Nvidia and AMD. Need SPY to go back to $470+ for my 468 calls. I even thought I was being good by paying more for in the money calls and still got screwed
I think the problem is you buy otm options hoping it goes up for that 600% gain
I did that on moderna, but I didn't this week on the 3. Actually bought all in the money options and then everything tanked
If it was the right play then I don’t think you would have lost all your fucken money again??? 🤔
Pretty sure I said I BOUGHT THE WRONG FUCKEN SPY OPTIONS YOU THICK SKULLED FUCK.
I’m gonna let the yelling slide this time because I’m sure you’re upset about losing all of your money. 

How can you buy the wrong options, but it’s still the right play, but you lost all your money? Sounds like the wrong play, buying the wrong options, and losing all your money.
I just don’t want to live anymore dude
Brooooo you alright man? You can always get more money. Only get one life. Stay safe my guy
I wish life was better man
Is it too soon to post a meme of that clip at the Travis Scott concert with Travis dancing on a pedestal while a guy is getting cpr down below and captioning Travis as “Elon musk” and captioning the dead guy as “Tesla bag holders”????

Travis is a fucking no good scumbag rich thug.  I bet he is a real little bitch.

“From there Cramer went up to Wall Street. As he was walking along the street, some gay bears came out of the bodegas and jeered at him. “Get out of here, baldy!” they said. “Get out of here, baldy!” He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of Jerome Powell. Then two bulls came out of the stock exchange and mauled forty-two of the gay bears. And he went on to the NYSE and from there returned to CNBC.”

100% true
Really hate this trend of women all getting fat and a bunch of Simps calling them thicc and saying they look better.

By the time my wish calls print I won't be able to find a girl with a BMI under 30
this is just on the internet, in the real world people are pretty much normal
"bunch of Simpson" lol
asvage. Agree thou. BMI in the US is the worse.
Fat acceptance and fat encouragement/enablement have blurred lines.
30bmi is still obese. under 25 is healthy.
What is VisualMods bmi
I know brah I drove down main street it was honestly gross.
TSLA $1500 EOW bc fuck your puts and Elon is just selling enough stock to exercise his options.

doesn’t last forever, appreciate it while you can valuations will get back to normal in 2022 while Tesla falls 50% Facebook will only fall 10%
I’m balls deep in FB, Tesla has to fall by 99% in order to make it fair value bro. These people living a fantasy
No one wants profit, they want promises.  Even if they are broken later.
stories > profits
No ones cares about profits. It's all about the hype.
TSLA also profitable dude. For at least a year now.
1.6B in revenue for the quarter sir. They are valued at over a TRILLION.

I personally don't know what to say when ppl thank me for my service. Like ummm You're welcome I guess? I did it for free college, money, and job experience. Not because I'm patriotic.
I did a lot less for my money, and behind a Wendys.

So thanks anyways
My roommate and I Re veterans and we used to troll each other by thanking each other for your service in akward situations. It's embarrassing when people say it.

Might sell 1 more then buy back when it dips when he sells more
Yeah I really regret not getting a call or 2 yesterday when I saw Tesla starting to rebound
He hasn't though... he's got a lot left to sell
Looks like SPY is gearing up for a great earnings report
Whenever you see someone here pumping something , look at their comment history. They always have options expiring soon.
I discuss stuff that i hold a position in but im reformed and hold deep itm options/shares so i can afford to hold longer term for the pump to come around like my BBBY 16C, having theta eat into to meme calls is retarded
Who else is buying the nvda dip?? 🚀🚀
added more at 298 and 295 yesterday - i get paid tomorrow and if it's still under 300 i'm buying more -
Yess me too, sounds like free money
Inflation is good for people with debt because it devalues it. (As long as your interest rate isn't variable then you get fucked by rate hikes)
I was just thinking about this. My house payment stays the same and I have a low fixed interest so inflation makes my house payment less.

It also makes my paycheck less.
that why visa run yesterday

Idk, ask them.
Did you rob em?

Get off of Robinhood. They're literally betting against you. When you purchase shares, your buys never even hit the market. They just have IOUs with your name on it. The more money you lose, the more money they make.

**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/miseno3231** bet **SPY** goes from **465.46** to **66666666.0** before **2021-11-12 07:17:57.526110-05:00**
I have a good feeling about this one
Seems pretty likely tbh
Cheers to any Vets on here, thanks for your service!!
SOFI gang check in 👇
Reporting, I made $13k on puts yesterday, sold at close and bought 1k shares and $10k in Leaps. Easy money!
Held on to my 1260 tesla calls like a true degenerate
One day you’re gonna regret this kind of mindset holding onto losing trades hoping it will rebound
Alright been saying this for the past 3 days now and I’ve been getting absolutely fucked but I see you spy please have a Green Day you fucking bitch
Imagine, there are people who don't own big tech.
Well that's becuase big tech owns me now
Warren buffet noises.
Aapl
"own"
0.00000000000000000042069% but that still counts
Gooooood morning my beautiful retards and veteran 🌈🐻 put holders 🥰 I hope your holiday is filled to the brim with fat gains!
If i were Elon i would sell my shares for a massive gain, tank the stock, buy back half the company at $50
He’s working on it
Yeah, but the Sec has rules to prevent this from occurring.  He needs to do a ‘Willie Nelson’.   Sell his stocks, have one of his rich friends use Elon’s money to buy them back, have a side deal that Elon really owns this stock.   Willie Nelson, during his tax crisis, his compadres bought his assets from the IRS for him when they were up for auction.
You forgot that he will buy puts first.  Then do what you said.
Elon is a godlike 4D chess player
Let’s all get high and buy $SOFI 🚀💰🚀💰🚀
We bought calls when we saw them big ol tittys can't wait for open
With you on the first part. 

SOFI is losing money
Will be profitable very soon. Huge growth. In 6 months you’ll be losing money by not investing in $SOFI 💰🚀🚀🚀💰💰🚀💰💰

BULLISH TECH BULL MARKET UNTIL THE END OF TIME 


STAY IN THE MARKET AND GET RICH BOYS!
I don’t understand the concept of “TSLA calls”. How do these even exist? Like… who exactly is selling me these things?
Anyone can sell you call options. Even you can sell options. You just need deep pockets.
Nice, bought yesterday a small amount of PLTR and I am already up almost 4%

When retail pumps pltr to 25 again - time to sell. Rinse repeat
Stock literally just goes from $21 - $27 only.
Yeah but once you embrace it - infinite money printer
Perfect for wheeling
Even chess masters get beat by bots and here we are thinking that we can beat bots...

Renaissance Tech is actually bots-based and that's why they win.

TSLA 8% day and I’m breaking even.

So its gonna be 6%

Anyways the moral of the story is he buys puts everyday 🌈🐻

goddamn psfe 40% haircut.  that shit is going to $1.  SHit has been around for decades - still lose money and cant grow

&#x200B;

Why did I buy that hype
So has Palantir
I rode it from 14 to 30 pltr and jump in/out for swings.  I'll probably buy some when it's 20 and ride it back to 25
Mark it down… PSFE goin back to $7 by next week just saying
Do a ban-bet then mr. confident
Kk
Not by next week, but it’s definitely got a long term future. Excellent dip buying opportunity

They did yesterday
Wtf pullback is over too bad you missed it
Keep going SPY you beautiful beast. PUMP

Triple bottom now on spy, lets light the solids and fucking teleport to ATHs
10yr yield going higher tomorrow when the bond market opens back up and SPY/tech not going to be happy...
Agree. I’m waiting to buy qqq puts until morning because I can just see the initial headline: “market higher despite rise in 10 year.”  And then hopefully I time the puts just right. I’m so sick of a headline like that when I feel like I did the right thing the day before.
My portfolio is fucking cocked locked and ready for 10yr rise. Cant wait to see it rise and my portfolio to somehow end up red anyways.
I hope the market actually makes some sense soon and we can make some money!!

You know it
ROOT still going up!
Root calls up 200% only regret not buying more.  And no I'm not selling...yet 😂
Cmon Mickey you dumb rat fucking rip back to yesterday’s price already
It'll be a few week/months before we see $170. $155 is much more likely in the short term.
The SPY daily sure looks like the start of a bull flag.
Exactly the point I made earlier. These December 1st expiration SPY calls are going to make me a pretty penny.
Might wait until tomorrow to load up tbh, still feels like it could crater any second..
I really hope SNDL flies because I have about 50k shares with covered calls that I would love to have assigned away at 1
I’ve been unbanned. God bless the mods!

wtf is this post?
Like if you hate risk so much that you're placing stop-losses, maybe invest in boomer funds instead? Either your investment horizon is too short, or you're investing in the wrong shit. You're literally just going to lose money because they hunt you, take your shit, plunder your butthole, and then pump that shit right back up. Congrats fa**ots, you've been pumped and dumped lol

Or he will find them and grow up thinking you're a pervert.
If COIN hits 290 tomorrow, I’ll shove 13 ice cubes up my ass.
Imagine being a PayPal bear and thinking those of us who loaded up on leap calls won’t just fookin do it again if it drops another leg down 🐻 ===> 🤡
PYPL and BABA leaps are most viable path right now. Lets see how those plays go..
Part of the ship part of the crew baby
I feel the same way but for PLTR. God speed retard
Palantir will absolutely do well over time but IMO it’s a share only type of move. That stock will be incredibly hard to time but when it has breakthrough or makes moves it will move up fast. That’s the kind of stock like sofi that you buy shares of and hold for ten years
Whoopass’s company actually makes money tho

Holy shit. Why do you think it's been tanking? I may have to add LEAPS as well.

You either cum in the sink or sink in the cum
None of us would be here with out cum.
And to think that all of us degenerates were at one time, the strongest, fastest and smartest to hit the target successfully while millions failed.
People who bought puts yesterday need to realize that inflation is already priced in. This is not news and no one actually believes it’s transitory since inflation feeds on itself. Buy calls and ride the wave so you’ll be able to afford that $10 banana.

*Wendy’s, we salute you*
SPCE, BNTX and DASH messed with my head this earnings season. Shook me out of UPST puts and made me too worried to pull trigger on BYND puts. I’m up 5k on the month, but…GUH. How the hell do you guys stay convicted and power through after some solid losses??
I smoke enough weed that I forget.  Then repeat infinitely.
By thinking of it as just numbers on a screen and not emotionally attached. Of course only what you can afford to lose too
Got it - I don’t think anyone has ever said it that bluntly but makes sense. I need to set some risk parameters to stick to as well I think and not waiver from that
Best way to keep your money
Yeah hard to fight the urge to chase stuff but not gonna FOMO. Id like to compound on my 5k month…not burn it all away 😂
It is hard and it sux sometimes thinking you would have made a bunch more, but stops have saved my ass more often then not.
Autism.
Grow numb to the pain.

&#x200B;

Start doing your own DD.  If it doesn't work, own the loss and learn from it.  Refine your DD process to include what was missed previously.

Maybe 25. Just surviving earnings this quarter without a big dump is a win
Qualcomm gonna roar back to ATHs today. Paper hands selling yesterday will be pissed.
Gymnopedie No. 1 by Erik Satie honestly goes so hard
All this time still balls deep in SOFI
Didn’t buy calls yesterday do I buy them at open?
Always fomo into positions
Absolutely.   One of the best decisions you could ever make.
Hold off a little and see what the market is doing later today. Might get a better entry than at open. Or not…
Green pre-market across the board....except for Disney. Feelsbad man
As a DIS put holder, feelsgood man
Bummer.
I put a buy in for Disney at $150 just for the hell of it several months ago. If that thing triggers, I will be shocked. Even at $164 it’s likely a bargain, but I promised myself I’d not, under any circumstance change my limit buys. 

So, I’ll probably change my limit buy.
Got puts as a hedge, dumb for not just getting more calls tbh
Same here with dis but vice versa, 20 calls and only 6 puts 🤡
What made you bullish? I was about to do the same thing when I saw this?
Fuck you PSFE ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
So glad I don’t have to check the market today. No positions expire til next Friday. Feels good. Will watch the market rabidly anyway.
High inflation priced in bois. Surprises move the market and this was no surprise anymore.
Can’t wait for TSLA 1250 so I can buy more 1000p
Wait, so we’re bullish today?
Rivian is carrying the market
I’m bullish every day. You really shouldn’t listen to the bears here. Most of them have brain damage.
The more you guys buy PSFE the more it goes down

Where do you think this is going? Lmao it literally won't got higher than 471 that is the ceiling. It could break out if that but has shown zero intention of doing so
Damn, how bad did PSFE miss?
It's less about how much it missed and more about how bad the future looks. Even the company isn't denying it.
Glad I don't hold much
I sold. I couldn't take any more pain and it looks like more than a year before it has a chance to recover.
It sounds like they think they're fucked.
Think about it. With inflation coming in a lot higher than expected where else can you store your money

Whats good for SPY was the selling. Way too much selling the past two days to pump. Maybe everybody cleared their shitty positions
If Vix drops I think I might buy a few calls expiring 8th Dec in case the market throws a mini shit-fit about the debt ceiling. Aside from that I cant think of any other negative catalysts between now and EOY. Not overly worried about the next CPI report, Rivian may have had as much to do yesterdays bloodbath as CPI. I like to think about this type of shit. It makes me feel like less of a gambler.
Do I sell my SPY call at open?  Or wait and let the market either reward me further or screw me?
Just do the usual
You mean pass on 15% gains so I can hold until it’s -90%?
Of course, why do you even ask?
Sell
Open. The. Casino.
Yo what the FUCK Paysafe..
It does what it does best. Drops 😂… kidding aside, my position looks rather bad now 💩
Rivian calls when lmao
I think 🕵️‍♂️ will still trend down today and tomorrow, but hey, I'm just a 🤡.
Even though I was routed yesterday, dropping 6%, I’m still up 4% on the week. Always have to zoom out to gain perspective
I'm down 75% All-time. I'm gonna go ahead and zoom back in.
Holy fuck. I hope you are joking.

really think we don't have rising inflation here as well?

dollar is rising compared to?
It depends on how much we are printing relative to other nations

Let the dump commence!
Puts been printing all week and I pick the one play that moons to be a 🌈🐻. My luck is trash.
Plug is doing that thing again
>Need more.
So 9:55 - 10:00 AM was a bull trap? 🤔
Where the fuck JPOW

leave of absence!!

Who the fuck approved it
The only bull move I could think of is buy more PYPL. and add a BABA leap. what else can i do?
Penn gonna pop on Portnoy 2pm news?
DIS calls on this dip seems like the way.. cashed out my puts for a decent profit but historically DIS has eaten up every large dip fairly quickly
Seems to be a gap that needs to be filled.
so does your mom
Quick and easy 30% scalping SPCE calls this morning. Needed a decent day trade so bad
WISH IV crush -- underlying up, short term option premiums down
this market sucks
CRSR calls going ham
Guess I’ll just buy spreads ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
China having another fine day on Wall Street e.g. JD +6%
I like to do a little fake business..
DIS March calls are half off today and today only. Go visit the mouse and get yours today
Duck the guy who talked up Paysafe awhile back. Don’t think I need to worry about my CC getting called away this week….

This price action is all over the place
LCID made me a lot of money so far.  Spooked a bit.
Earnings next week. It's run up a ton so it's going to need a solid report to hold where it's at, you may want to lock in some profits
The exact second I sell Amd it pops after
F
LOL my stop loss was literally bottom of the hour so far. 

Nice. Awesome. Chill. Dope. Tight
What's a stop loss
I wish i had this mindstate. They’re back up to break even now
Scared money don't make money
Tendyman feeding me off my SPY calls
Should I put $500 into 1dte SNDL .50 puts 🤔
Anyone buying wish puts?
of course, f Wish
Anyone in PYPL for a day trade? Thinking 205+ today. Venmo and AMZN big deal.
I'm ddeep as fuck in leaps
Oh fuck a 6/22 250c cheap as fuck
wish making amc look juicy

wake me up when the VIX goes green
FSR so horny rn
Read the PSFE report, I guess I’ll buy the dip. Could be worse I reckon
So what’s the story on this
Guidance cut for Fiscal Year 2021, but they gave their reasoning as to why and it was complications with the wallet. I’m going shares not options. I’m willing to hold for a decent time
EV stonks are going bananas today...LCID, NIO and even HLYN is getting in on the action
Even SOLO lmao
FSR 🥵
What is everyone's 1 year target price for Ford $F?
Somewhere between $15 and $23/share
That doesn’t bode well for my calls
$5
Why did WISH pop today?
Maybe some people liked their earnings and Q4 outlook? Or maybe because it's 11:11 on 11/11
Curious how people feel about BMBL prospects.  Cuffing season is coming up and this 15% dip may be providing an entry point.  Any bullish/bearish reasons to buy/stay away?
It's a money loser
That’s my main fear.  If their user base can’t increase at a rate to compensate for that then it could be a real trap.
It's IPO price. I'd wait
Oh yea I forgot how it was so much higher than the original ipo price.  That’s what kept me away then
Bumble seems like a great company and app, but they also have a lower priced Badoo app which indirectly competes with their main app. 

I would go long, as the future is online dating, but badoo is garbage.
I definitely agree with the online dating sentiment.  The apps with the best branding should win out in my mind.  I wonder if selling badoo could be in their future
CRSR doing that thing it does 1-2x per quarter.
bmbl calls are free money. unless they aren’t.
Fuller go easy on the Pepsi
FULLER
I need Bill Hwang to tell me AMD is gonna moon from here on.
Why is CRSR popping off on high volume?
idk retard maybe cause it’s undervalued?
Very cool Visa, dip below $200 please
Damn what’s wrong with dkng
I’m ready to back the fake dentist SDC pump around the corner!
Good job PLUG gang!!! Keep pushing…
I love seeing posts like “who’s selling at x price?”. I think some of you really only buy the top
if the market make sense we will all be very rich
V is just as much of shit as PYPL.
At least V is the one who issues the cards coinbase and others are using lol 😂
Just thinking the same thing lol
I’m up on $LCID wtf do I do? Sell, hold, buy something else? Buy some more?!! I do not have a clue what I am doing
Seriously tell me what to do!! And is $500 to low to be making any realistic gains? I have PTSD from shipping AMC and GME and TSLA last year I AM PARALYSED WITH INVESTMENT FEAR
Used $600 to make $30k on nvidia calls last week in one day
I’m srsly not cut out for this

To those manipulating the market: If we dont get a really fat pump today please if we can have one tomorrow to go into the weekend with i wanna eat kobe beef all weekend not wendys
My best play this year was the one where I did more research than the analysts.
SAVA dip is getting eaten up! Won’t be under 100 forever 🚀
I sold my calls for you
$MU poppin today boys!
PYPL almost back to 200. I held this for a long time. Got shares called at around 280 I think. I'm glad they got called. I would have been crying today.
Perfect entry!
Yeep PYPL is a household name. It's not going to stay down forever.

Weed sector sure as hell looks like it has bottomed out.  MSOs have the absolute best earnings growth potential out of any investment out there.
Something that happens near the end of an equity bull market that’s run for 10+ years is that people’s credulity goes to insane levels. People who wouldn’t have touched stocks ten years ago will now completely believe in any story attached to a rising asset price and anyone who questions it is old and out of touch. A tale as old as time

Sticky?
Probably not a 10%+ correction until next year. Or if Powell admits that inflation is a REAL problem at the December meeting. (Ain’t it crazy that everyone knows it’s a problem but they just want to pump the markets?!)
NVDA pinned at VWAP tells me that this is 100% algos on full auto.
They need to turn the fuck off
They wanna stop the bleeding on weeklies. Next week I think will be moonshot.
Hopefully Bc that’s when my contracts expire 🤣

I know as soon as I paper hands these QQQ calls it will fly. But it cannot break 392 today.
I’m wondering if the ten year will actually start moving up soon. Might now get this santa rally. Maybe already had it???  F, wish I knew.
BRB tying a cinder block around Tesla’s ankles real quit to solve this issue we are having

Literally the only prediction I will be right at today!
Bless your soul fellow retard
Still some selling to be had. Looking at 1085
Imagine thinking SPY was going to break $467 today
Turned off fast money. Enough about DIS!!!!
omg I just saw a huge demon cock appear out of nowhere   :O
Is Rivian a good buy still?
If you believe in the stock that it will go up like TSLA in the future
When is this Reddit IPO coming out
Oh man. This game is getting expensive.
This $464.3 support is unreal lol
NEGG could see $100
If it happens on WeBull it doesn’t count
What happens on WeBull stays on WeBull
Only good thing I did this week was buy these Disney calls.
what lil tech gains are evaporating
#SHREKS DICK HAS ENTERED THE CHAT
volume today is comical, guess we going for 4 straight red days tomorrow
Action on GME sure is moving slow

Not nearly as much as Stephen “shit stain” Weiss though
Stock starts shooting up. Opens depth chart. 

Oh fuck yeah, those are numbers alright
If lazr can get back above 20.60 and finish there we are going on a fucking ride.
I bet it crashes after earnings
I don't know I placed calls for tmmr. They had a deal with NVidia on Monday I believe
Yeah but that won’t affect these earnings
If a contract was signed they can release the numbers after trading hours. Like door dash revealed they're buying a 7 billion dollar company after hours
I hope you’re right because I have calls (which is why I think it will crash) I also have blnk calls
I haven't heard of BLNK might look into it rn before closing
They have earnings AH
Hm ok ok I think i'll sit it out and see how it performs
Probably a good idea.. my luck has been horrible lately
I had two great calls with 2000% gains total with small 100 and 200 dollar calls and one that sucked me dry
SPY just execute the order
Is there a reason why some people can repost meme after meme, but I can't upload my own without being offensive or anything?

Seems like the bar for this sub changes like the stock market.
Looks like pltr is just going to inverse the market today
....and another red day.
Dash is basically that trump poster with his face on Rambo.
pretty funny seeing the WISH bagholders have hope this morning.
WOW WISH TO THE MOON!!!!!!!! drops fuckin 12% from when they bought calls and freefalling as we speak

You guys sleeping on Riot Blockchain, they're having earnings next week hop onto the ride fellas.
This post is one year too late
black friday stock market crash too obvious right?
> I think so.
No
queue up the black friday sale X stock at X% discount memes
NEGG, go back to bed
NVDA is gonna get pinned at 300 till friday to kill premium isnt it
Going to get pinned at 300 until earnings.
then dump like all growth after earnings?
Yep. It's gone up 50% in a month. It's going to see a reduction even with a good earnings. And if its earnings are bad it's going to 250 or below.
The moment I sell all my PLTR shares out of anger and frustration, it will uptrend.
Plz sell
That is true for every stock except PLTR, you’ll be fine
why doesn't PLTR ever hold its price
I mean if you want my honest answer, its over glorified and way over valued. It’s also just a printing machine for shares through SBC. Executives and insiders win while retail is stuck holding the bag.
how is their SBC different than any FANG company

what should they be trading at 14-18?
Massively different, I’d suggest you look into it as its a bit too technical to type out on a comment on my phone. Exactly though, I believe fair value rn is about $18
I'll look into it...right off the bat though I wouldn't imagine they would mess up their stock any worse than other big silicon valley tech companies.
CNBC headline EOD market is gay and couldn’t hold gains.

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Milk_n_Serial (1/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 900.0 when it was 1052.2 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Next leg up will be from PYPL 🚀🚀
QS and LCID are just retardant stocks lol
RIDE making a decent run up to ER

It’s printing nice 😂🥃 so far so good ⬆️⬆️⬆️

that might pay off. When did you get them?
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/StopTheBan420 (2/4) made a bet that FB would go to 350.0 when it was 333.845 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Stop the ban!
Dear QQQ & SPY,  


Just close green today and we gucci. We'll get em next week
ok retards, what's the PUT play today at close?
AZN
RIDE or LAZR
I have puts on BLNK. Wish I would have waited, but you live and you learn. Or live, at least. They're having a huge run up right now on the infrastructure bill, so I think some people are going to be disappointed by their earnings, no matter how close they are to expectations.
RIDE to $10 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Why is 🍏 such trash
Give it time. When all the other meme bullshit falls Apple will keep steadily going up.
I am running out of patience. YTD it hasn’t moved 5 % on average 🤦‍♂️😂
Zoom out a couple years. AAPL the kind of company you hold for decades, not weeks or months.
It was at $56 in 2019. It has tripled. But profits have not. It’s expensive.
So many companies are much worse. At least aapl is leading the market in phones
Yeah, I agree with that but it’s so big already that it’s growth rate is slower now. Who knows, man. Not me.
Yeah I am not disagreeing with you. It’s just frustrating
What’s the grossest ugliest stock on the market? Go!
CLOV no doubt.

big money keeping it down every session to pump AH and sell at open to buy in lower, every day this week maybe monday breaks the pattern for earnings
I just semi-YOLOed into KHC because I was hungry and it's ticker reminded me of KFC.
Can I offer you ELY/Topgolf off of record revenue earnings and multiple price target upgrades up to $60?
$ELY is crazy cheap!

Super bullish on $ELY. TopGolf is the shit!
Yea i think theres a boomer messing with it the past couple days after earnings hopefully next week it takes off
There was a hiccup in Vietnam supply chain I believe. Everyone wants a Callaway driver for Christmas and a trip to top golf. $ELY looks like a buy
$ROOT up 30%!

The math checks out on this one, boys
In paysafe at 4.19. Either I made a mistake or I’ll make $10
It’s a bad day when on PLTR has made you money …
Where’s all the volume it’s dead out here
$ROOT
It’s Veterans Day, bond market is closed, so low volume on stock market as well
$ROOT
It’s in EV stocks
Anyone holding through BLNK earnings? feel like the pump is related to monday bull signature and not on optimistic earnings
Spy green, my calls red
Plug and FCEL are alive and kicking again lads and ladies!!
amzn go uppies plz 🥺

Back in the day, being sued by the country tanked a stock, now it’s just a light dip?
We live in a world where a major lawsuit today is tomorrow’s old news. We had a president who was orange and now we switched him out with a guy with dementia. We also trade fake coins mined on the internet. The world is on its head. Your puts won’t print gay bear 🐻
Hang on I’m no bear. I’ve been on the bull wave for years. 
I just saw I good opportunity to make some money back after my AMD calls bent me over yesterday
Yes but we all know puts rarely print with JPOW running this ship. Also the entire world could be burning and people wouldn’t care about it. We live in a wild word dude
RIDE broke $7!! This will moon to double difits
Any weight on the ROOT ,TSLA collab
$RIDE going up on news released in October when the stock was $5 and didn't react to it. Clown market

Guys what are we thinking for BLINK earnings? Calls are fun but puts print..
Root volume doubles and goes up 30%? If your shorting this your fucked , sooo fucked
I dont know what to play
If PSFE didn’t declare bankruptcy it is probably a good entry point.
I bought some Jan calls hoping for a turnaround
Come on CAT what you doin to me
Oh yeah keep going EXFY! I’m almost there!
PSFE seems like a good buy at this price
The mouse will be ok once mando releases
EGLX!! (TSX) Let’s fucking go!!!
....and still FSR is only $6.5B????...and 30% short retards...will be $20B after next Wednesday, the Ocean reveal at the Auto Show.
Let’s hope. I’ve been holding since it went pubic. Cost of $15 but I need bigger gains for the time I’ve been holding.
HYLN said fuck your downgrades
Anyone else here feels like market is going crazy? Like crazier than January last year? Everything related to ev is mooning even shitty companies like NKLA. I feel that there were so many easy plays and easy money to make and I missed on all of them. Could have just put all my money on FSR or LEV or PLUG and made bank. Instead, I decided to lose money on MRNA. Fml

Weed calls for next week. Think it’s a safe play even with market volatility. Weed stocks / ETFs have hit a bottom recently and momentum is definitely picking up. Only positive news.
As soon as I open a put credit spread, Starbuck begins to fall. you fucking piece of shit!
BBBY is the Becky play man
Naw, I only open spread on blue-chip stocks. They are printer. Starbuck still gonna give me $90 in two weeks, I just hate seeing negative in my portfolio
Again BBBY, they have as much cash onhand as their entire float. Starbux is overpriced and BBBY is underpriced with 60% short interest and a CEO buying back the entire float. 

You do you but I mean it's an ez call
I would do BBBY, but I'm not too familiar with them. Only been trading for 5 months so I'm still learning shit tons of stuff. Sticking to what I know for now, but BBBY is added to my watch list tho.
Doesn’t even feel like the market is open today
nice PAYSAFE CALLS LADS
Bought leaps
I’m eatin ass over here
What to do, fellow Wishtards? Hold or sell?
Wow ATVI is actually green
There were some big buy orders earlier
bout time
Deff. I have 46 67.5c 12/17
Nobody likes BYND or what. I guess I should buy it now
They missed 8 consecutive earnings. Sure go ahead buy it 😂
Most vegans/vegetarians don’t want to eat fake meat because even the idea of eating meat grosses them out.

Non-vegans will always prefer the real thing. They’ll try the fake version once for novelty and never touch it again.

There’s just not much of a market out there for the product.
I know product doesn't really matter anymore but I found it to be a hard sell. I'd rather just eat better meat less frequently and eat more veg than eat a bunch of simulated meat that was okay but not great.
BBY calls finally green again
If Ford hits $25 by January next year I'm gonna cop the Mustang-e

Shout out to whoever mentioned Super League on here... up 17% today

Paysafe is gonna maybe be a little better tomorrow, idk.
I’m in for 400, I’d expect some sort of correction. Too big of a swing
The bond market is closed and meme stocks are up
Bring back the smooth lines SPY!
Considering jumping in on this 12/31 500c play. I dunno though. Maybe 490 would be better. 

The biggest thing working against this play in my mind is that u/AxemanFromMA thinks it’s smart and everything he touches expires worthless
https://ibb.co/dBqtBwt

🤡
Yes, that is a chart, well done
Yeah, I want to jump in with the 465 11/26 but his confidence makes me really uneasy.
I think SPY has cleansed itself of that crash. People really shouldnt be doing too much more selling and it seems people are buying in at this price level now

Bought January $RIDE $7.5 puts for earnings
Oh yes TSLA do it
Joe Terranova sold Netflix 20 points lower from here two days ago. Was on fast money talking with such confidence he had it figured out.
Imagine being named after a shitty SyFy channel show that only lasted 2 seasons
Leaps on BA?
never a bad play
PYPL floor is at $200, it has held this support for days now, including yesterday’s intense selling pressure.  If it didn’t go below $200 then, it’s not going below it at all.  Load up!
I agree.  I sold my 201 buy at 207, but got back in to hold long at 202.5
Do not sell your shares cheap, buy this and hold with full confidence.  I have $25,000 in it now.
Yeah kinda think so too but ...

The real problem is... PYPL may be a tax loss candidate in December.

I'd stay away until Jan... can make money elsewhere.
Someone buy my pfe 11/12 61$ for 1$ I need it for some Wendy’s frosty

Alcoholic cocaine addict in skinny jeans making bad decisions?

Who could have possibly seen this happening?!
as an alcoholic cocaine addict in skinny jeans I can assure you that you are correct
Almost all the stocks IPOed last year tanked after earnings
I got inspired by the PSFE dip and bought OTLY 5P 😂😂😂 potential 9000% gain
Noice bounce back hopefully it will continue into tomorrow!
Since earnings are pure gamble, I bought puts for tomorrows astra zenaca's earning report.
why not just play a straddle lol
Hey usa. Why even open if you going to be all slow like this
My portfolio A shaped recovery.
The morning pump to all day fade is worse than just tanking outright and you can’t convince me otherwise.
People really trust a Chinese brokerage with their life savings? Lmao
> Yes.
IWM needs life support
Huh?  It’s up 1% today….
Im still red on my calls. I need like 243 at this point
Chart still looks super bullish after a whole year of consolidation
lol this portnoy press conference... but also, like, wow, thank god for receipts.
LOL DKNG you had me there for a second
I'm long NVDA calls.  How does that run still have life left in it but I think it does.  Joy to the future of tech.
What options exactly are people buying with SNDL????
Calls, no thesis or likeness just gamba #earningsszn
But what strikes?  Seems retarded when a share is 70 cents
It is retarded if you’re anticipating a 30% run up. It will only print on a 50-100% run which is what i’m betting on(over a few days). They are FD plays, but I also have a .50 strike as a hedge. Shares are definitely the better play if you think they will beat
The aren't. Why buy options on a gd penny stock
Then why is iv 500%
yolo nov 19th $1 calls because I hate money. Also 1/22 $1 calls because I believe it has potential to reach that target by then. 

These all make up a very small amount of my portfolio though. Just doing it in the slight chance they post good earnings. But every single earnings has always sold off, which should be the expectation going into this one too.
Semiconductors (except INTC lmao) dancing today while rest of the market bleeds the fuck out
All on pretty low volume.
Yes hello, I would like a venti green latte with three extra pumps of QQQ please.
Come on daddy Elon, pump for bloody gay bear assholes
Stay back, WISH bag holder is coming through! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Wish? Don’t you mean PSFE bagholders with 13+ cost averages? Lol
Cute! after buying all the dips, Still -24% down
You aren’t -50% plus? Nice. You’re kind of winning?
If I was winning then I'm at wrong place here
I hope things get better. Need to figure out if the time cost is worth holding and hoping for a rebound or just selling and putting the money in AMD or SPY or something. Good luck man. Good luck.
PFSE will he 50 next year
Yeah. Dreams are nice, aren’t they?
Got some Disney fd calls.  Come on buddy!
Bond market is going to take such a dump tomorrow
Why do I even look at my portfolio, it never brings me joy?
THETA THETA THETA
Your honor I am not a grapist
A huge bullish bet just hit my screen... GME $300c 12/17 exp... whoever you are please don't forget to post your loss porn
Some real dog shit after hours so everything will probably moon
I hope my limit order fills :) this part is always fun
So I should of kept my amd 11/12 150c after all instead of selling for a 80% loss yesterday. 

Fuck you bears.
I’m still down…
Big tech dumping
This market feels like watching someone fall in slow motion
Fuck it I’m gonna pull a boomer yolo buy a few DIS leaps
Make up your mind SPY!
I was promised telsa crash i would like to see elons manager

Probably because you’re staring at them 🧐
Probably thinking about putting their cock on your face
No but you look like a dick tho

Hate flat days man.
TFW volume is so low you’d actually prefer your stock to close red

that's a lot of dmg
Time to buy DIS calls. Let's go!
Did you guys grab more SOFI ?
Is anyone watching the USD index lmao
Algorithms are.
So many indicators firing off, it's crazy. Shame the bond market is closed today.
Is it entertaining watching?
Breaking through a big resistance if my crayons are to be trusted… makes me wanna buy puts on SPY but nothing makes sense anymore
Live Nation is facing billions in lawsuits. Why won't this thing crater to the 100s already.
Fucking profitable company. I missed the entry point of a lifetime in 2020

I am short on this simply for TA reason, the gap are being filled slowly

Holy fuck this is lame
Just close at a perfect 0.0
Anybody playing NVDA for earnings?
I would love to say calls, but I’m literally 1 for 9 in my last earnings calls plays, so feel free to inverse me
Yes, 320c for 11/26. Had a 275c for earnings but rolled up
No more earnings plays for me. I’ve had enough
What day is it
17th
no bc last time it did well it tanked on good earnings
Bought NVDA @ $302 for earnings play
whats the play? I thought they didnt get the meta deal and the earrnings would under perform. But I guess with how things are itll moon.
What day is earnings
Google is a thing you know

Jus bought DKNG $45 1/21 Calls  LFG!
Nice.  This dip has ran too long
I find it interesting that Hulu Live wouldn’t play FBN or CNBC on the same day that DIS reported abysmal earnings. 🤫
What’s with this sideways shit… just drop already
Todays veterans day thats why
Prolly flat till close, flat tomm. And consolidation till after Turkey Day.

Boring but more then likely true
There’s literally no volume. Once algos start up tomorrow with bonds trading again everything will probably drop

Ride puts and calls!
Cash gang
There should be a filter that shows stocks that mooned/dumped most in the last 30-60 minutes.
anyone playing RIDE or BLNK earnings?
RIDE puts. But it'll probably explode on the Foxconn deal.
RIDE 11/19 6p. We shall see. I’ve taken to making very small bets on earnings to observe and learn. For instance I had $6 puts on WISH that were up 50% or more at marker close, and puts on CLOV that we up prior to market close Monday, and now puts on RIDE that are printing. What I’m learning is buy those shots the day before earnings then unload day of
Bought a bunch of 165 11/19 $DIS calls. May the mouse bless me
If I was Xi, I'd buy TSM puts before attacking Taiwan.
I feel like people don’t understand the degree to which China is probably never going to fucking attack Taiwan
Am i a retard for holding BBBY calls overnight?
Are you gunna?

Headquartering your business out Cabo is fantastic. Highly recommend to you retards if you can ever get square on your margin debt.
Boring day. Let's get some volatility up in here tomorrow & OpEx next week
I am beyond disappointed in the market today
That damn Mickey Mouse just likes to FUQQ 🤣
Hedged my CHWY calls with puts today and it worked pretty well.  Sold the puts end of day for a 20% gain and made up for 70% of the loss on my calls
Someone really wants AMZN above 3470
my coworker is talking to me and I literally have not heard a single word they just said. even now as I type. ... it's fuckin 8am bro
Guys, make sure you buy TSLA so Lorde Edge can dump millions of shares at the best possible price. I’d hate to see him go broke
Lmao exactly. Poor guy needs to exit without losing too many of his billions.
To hell with the bottom 99.99999999%
🧂🌈🐻🤡
GME's about to rip to 250 again I feel it in my balls
Stop telling me to buy shit that's up 30% or 40% today, I missed the boat fuck off. Gimme a play that hasn't gone up stupid amounts
SPY $465c 23/12 get in for the xmas rally
$FUBO

TSLA is done for boys and girls, bring on the downvotes
I bought calls for tomorrow just now.  I think its gonna rip
We shall see, one of us will be in the Wendy's dumpster for sure
holding onto my 1050P for 11/12 oooooffff
this inflation is not that bad... it's tepid.. i am currently living (and have lived) in countries where normal inflation is 15-30% - where the prices on menus in restaurants are written in wax pencil so they can change them daily.  These are countries where the gov only hurts the situation.  The FED has so many tools and capabilities to manage inflation. If you look at the data, the majority of the CPI is tied to fuel costs.  Both direct fuel for autos, and it's trickle down effects on the rest of the economy.       


I'm in the oil/gas business,  and like it or not, higher fuel prices mean more jobs, and not just directly in the industry.  It trickles down to large purchases and even real estate.        


What i don't get is why republicans bitch about higher gas costs when they are the ones keeping the oil industry pumping by diminishing climate change and pushing against clean energy.      

Guess it's just something to make biden look bad
Nobody trying to make Biden look bad he does it well enough already
Mods BAN for POLITICAL BULLSHIT
Un-ironic take.
I hope yr enjoying gas prices being $3.50 to $5.  We don’t live in fucking other countries we live here in the USA so what do I care about other countries inflation stats. This isn’t a political issue. Higher Gas prices Affect thousands of businesses. Price of supplies go up because of transportation costs To get product to the end-user. You know that so who are you kidding? This is just a chance for you to get in a political dig. Keep politics out of here bud.
$5 each gallon, real estate double, purchase +20% here. I think it doesn't work here.
This is such a shit take for someone "working in the oil and gas industry".
God bless the veterans
God bless America
God Bless you
God bless all of you!
I love yall mf strangers hands down best community! 🙌🏽 even the 🏳️‍🌈🐻 need a little love

Good for my Jan 2k calls. Not good for my Dec 580 and 600 puts. Let’s go Elon dump your shit before my expiry. Then buy back again by end of Jan.
Bye bye, miss American SPY. Get your puts for Friday now if you haven't already.
I tried to read the second sentence to the tune of “drive your Chevy to the levy” and it made my brain hurt.

Would be stoked, will not count on it.
China is up 2%. It's going to be solid green today.

Can we get a PLTR rebound?
Fuck no. Worst company ever. Trades sideways for a year then plummets on good earnings? Primarily because no one has a bench mark for them because no one knows what they do.
Something about big data

No go back to bed

Yes its open

Come on. Who the fuck is buying WISH? They literally said it gets worse from here and retards still buy the shit. Jesus Christ.
Anyone who ever used Wish in the past should have known it was a garbage company.

My daughter tried to get me to buy something there a couple years ago and I was like "No, kiddo, this is fake Chinese garbage".
Exactly. Its like all the fake Chinese shit on Amazon, except the entire site is like that. Its American to let it die.
No, you can't let a business die! It's basically a person.
Was thinking of buying PSFE, but then had to drive my gf to work. I guess I dodged a bullet. Buy the dip?
Honestly I’m trying to find out when their dip ends
Probably not today. It's most likely going to crater more today. I'd wait a few days to see if it finds a bottom.
#Everyone is dumb but at least we know one thing for sure: stocks going up today
This comment is disputed.
Hard not to like Anthony Noto from SOFI

You mean hedge funds are dumping their bonds for stocks?
Thoughts on 468 today?
Hell yea bro 🇺🇸🇺🇸

Buy AMC
If you aint buyin the disney dip you hate money
Not gonna lie guys, my puts aren't doing great, and being a bear kinda sucks, I might switch back to being a bull again.
wait for the top
Yo PaySafe doesn’t seem very safe
You safely pay them.
Tsla has already broken down the $1k buy wall yesterday, if it goes anywhere near 1k expect 950 nearly instantly
Apparently Elon sold more stock the day before yesterday? I have a feeling we’re not done with this massacre…. Not to mention regular people who have stock and aren’t tuned in like we are move 2-5 days slower than we do.
> I have a feeling we’re going to see the bottom in the next few days.
You are a bot and this was an automated response, chill
I learned my lesson… I grabbed a put on Monday, thought oh shit it’s just gonna go up, but it took like 1-2 days to see the effects. And that’s when we saw that blood red Tuesday
We’re aren’t done - stocks seems to want to go lower but it’s probably artificially pumped to limit the immediate impact of the sales.
It’s holiday season and I just don’t know if people are gonna risk losing all those gains they saw this last month. It’s gonna be a selling frenzy…
Fair point. But Tesla defies gravity so you never know… however, Elon selling is new - only happened once a long time ago
Defies gravity sounds like a bubble to me… 😥
I sold that out too at a loss….
imagine buying puts at the bottom
I swung some yesterday during the dump, but I knew that they were wildly overpriced and people who bought them will get DICKED when this action kicks the other way (it always does).
It's like playing hot potato with volatility, not for the faint of heart
Thanks for the cheap TSLA puts yesterday

Why’s no one talking bout sofi being up nearly 20% lol?
Probably  because we all know what comes after pumps like that
More pumps?
They beat earnings so it's not like there isn't a reason.
Likely (but hopefully not) being kept out of reaching $25 w contracts expiring tomorrow.
It's gunna flyyyy
It's a sleeper.
Because it's being talked about yesterday already?
Lucid and Rivian through the roof. All day
Guys Elon only sold 5 Billion. Its not going up a lot today. Hes still got 15 Billion left. Let it drop and we can get cheap shares.
"Cheap"
Let it drop so i make back a year of losses

Moderna admits significantly higher risk of myocarditis compared to Pfizer/Biontech. Of course BNTX reacts by going red 😐
*in young men. Also says it has less breakout cases, better protection from Covid than BioNTech vaccine.
*overall. I don’t see the data that supports this better protection. BNTX was more careful- advancing the one of their 4 vaccine candidates that offered the best efficacy/safety combo

I bought a TSLA put for 880 by next Friday, I know positively it won't happen...so why did I do it 🤡
[deleted]
Still no chance lol, if it tanks a bit beforehand and I can get even a slim profit I'm jumping ship
[deleted]
Stop getting my hopes up lmao
This is very funny to me.
Shouldnt $F be jacked up to tits with Rivian doing well?
Profit taking. Ford had a 30% run up prior rivian ipo. Buy the rumour sell the news remember 😉
figured
selling TSLA calls is literally free money
Until the stock craters back to $800
That would make him even more money
If they’re covered calls, he would need to hold 100 shares of TSLA. Yea he gets premium but if the underlying went to $800 that’s a -25% loss. So is he selling naked calls? In that case yes, free money while Elon continues to sell
do you think I would hold shares of this garbage company lmao
Oh I'm sure they are naked, just like the naked calls I've been selling on GME lol
Playing with fire with that upcoming LRC partnership lol, what platform do you sell naked calls on?
> I am not a person or entity. I cannot sell anything, nor do I have any control over the price of LRC.
buying TSLA calls is also free money
not anymore ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
what calls did you sell? and how long are you planning to hold them?
> I sold a bunch of puts on GME and GME. I'm going to hold them for at least 1 year, but could be 3-5 years if the market doesn't crash before then
nice.. good luck getting rid of them if the market does crash

I think now is the best time in a while for a Tesla short.  Musk’s sales keep a lid on the stock for now and easily could drift back down to around 800-850 as people/algos realize it’s hard to fight that kind of sell volume
My Tesla puts are fucked right now
I personally like a short better than than puts.  The bulls won’t let it sudden crash, but I think it bleeds down, favoring a slow short
I think you are spot on. Which is wasn’t down so much and could get out of this position today. Hoping it bleeds down tomorrow or else I’m seriously bigly fucked. I went in way over leveraged
I’d like to give a quick shout out to Master Chief. Thank you for all that you’ve done for humanity.

NVDA 320 is not a meme.   Can’t get to 420 without going through 320.
Next leg up will be PYPL 🚀
Wish I wasnt poor and could buy leaps
So it's TSLA holding everything up?

Cool, that's not terrifying
Imagine if there was a healthcare company stock like the military one from cyberpunk where they have helicopters and private soldiers n shit.
People that put trailing stop-losses on semi-volatile growth stocks are pussies and need to be executed
YES
I listened to retards telling me to panic sell my December AMD calls and now I pay the price
That’s why I quit options days like yesterday would fuck me up wayyyy too much to hold through November
Hope CNBC got a commission with how hard they pumped RIvian.
Can’t wait for them to not mention it again
Yesterday was all-day RiVian
SPY calls if you love America
I fucking love America. That place is fucking dope
Why we drilling
Big money asked for some drilling so they could buy cheaper SPY calls

why won't telsa die?
it's the paradigmatic bubble stonk in the Great Retard Bubble period of history in which we find ourselves
Tsla buyers just take a couple weeks off and buy back when tsla is 850-900, it’s not that big of a deal you’re not missing life changing money buying a $1T stock….. what you think it’s gonna x20 again? Fucking idiots
riding puts down til it bottoms out at 900 is the only reasonable thing to do right now
You know it's options plays right?
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
What are you talking about, shares?
The year is 1993. SPY is $45 a pop and you can smack a waitress’s ass with no repercussions. Good times.
People could still laugh along with blazing saddles and not get offended.
you said this already
SPY calls you better make up for yesterday
Dark money empowers the worst forces in politics. It prevents citizens from understanding what’s going on in their own democracy.
The worst part is, those costs are passed onto the people being screwed, so they're paying to be fukt.
I wish bears were brave enough to stick around on green days. Those fuckers scurry back to their holes at any hint of adversity. Weak
nah, they are watching. just too pussy to post. stupid bers

How are people holding Tesla here, it’s literally hanging on by a thread and any second can drop 10%
Here is walls street bets
I wish it would drop 10%. Id load the boat
Simple. These people have elongated masochism.
 I've been in and out of lcid so many times now, I feel like a priest and his alter boy.
If you degenerates can go ahead and start dumping RBLX, that’ll be great. Need my puts to print. Thanks
Wow glad I unloaded this morning for 18%. Good time to jump back on though
I just want you to know: no matter where you are in your career, you’re probably doing better than me and I think that’s okay.

I am looking for a new full time job in the tech industry and using my old title as an analyst to hopefully land me a 80-100k job. Previously I made about 45-50 range. 28 years old. Sql and basic python, some experience with excel vba/data visualization. 

Great things coming your way. I hope I can fake my way to a good 6 figure job in tech. 

Plus I’m losing money.

Shitty career path so far + shitty losses + getting fucking older + cant get girls + fap all day.

Time to change something. Congrats on being better than me
I’m a security guard and live with my mom
Living the life
Its the little things in life. Go connect with ppl network better get yourself out of your norm.take that risk just dont go over the edge if tour scared of heights
go to the gym?
Are you in my cubicle right now?
Grind leet code hard everyday for like 2 months and you'll get a 150k+ tech job easily.
Not that easy. Especially when you’re still new to this vs. Software people who took it for 4 years in school. Im a business major
Pro-tip from someone that's been in the tech industry awhile and doing fairly well for myself:

Figure out if you want to be technical (coding, SQL, etc.) or project/business facing and pick a path and commit to it. Floundering somewhere in the middle will probably keep your salary lower than it should be. 

Project Management, Business analysis, Product management, etc. are great career paths, but you probably need to drop your technical skillset and work harder at documentation, complex planning, and business acumen. Also getting your PMP will net you about 20k salary immediately (assuming you go towards Project or Product management as a career path). If that doesn't sound interesting, go to a coding academy and build your technical skills deeper. Engineers shouldn't be making under 120k in this market.
Aren’t business analysts/project managers just as technical? Most of the ones I know in tech are doing python scripts/coding/automating on top of doing analytics. 

Also how stressful is project management? Especially coming from 0 experience, but have experience in analytics at some “tech” company? 

Thing is I know I don’t want to do full on coding because I’m just not skilled enough and I find it hard whereas I feel like others can leetcode shit so easily or can at minimum brute force while I can’t. 

I also don’t want to be non-technical at all because that would mean lower potential salary. I want to be at a good place. 

That’s why I always cant decide between cloud/business analyst/project manager(no exp)/salesforce analyst, etc. Idk what to do. 

Im 28 too… time is ticking
Just as technical? Not a shot. Technical enough to understand dependencies, help solution, and drive project progress? Absolutely. 

Project Managers front most (if not all) of the political bullshit that goes along with building software, so yes it can be incredibly stressful. This is why they are valuable when they are good. 

Business analysts do a lot of juggling of both worlds, which is why they are extremely in demand right now. The problem is it can be somewhat of a dead-end job once you hit the 120k area, unless you go into management or consulting. 

There is no easy, non-stress path unfortunately. It's really a decision of technical or less technical with a bit more stress and responsibility. Those who pick one and hone those skills early tend to succeed far more than those who waver between them. 

Also, subject matter expertise is as valuable as gold. Staying with a tech company for more than a few years to allow yourself to understand all the little ins and outs of it's internal and external systems can be extremely profitable if you'd rather not be a hot shot coder that makes money purely on efficiency, speed, and quality. 

I work with a ton of engineers that are valuable (and get paid stupid money) simply because they know the systems like the back of their hand - and are relied on because of it. Not so much because of their skills.
Honestly appreciate the feedback. What do you do if you don’t mind? 

So right now I’ve done some work as an analyst doing some sql in snowflake, basic python, excel, data visualization tools (nothing amazing) at a somewhat of a “tech” company. 

I did my azure fundamentals certs but i didnt really learn anything tbh. 

I do eventually want to make 6 figures. I just really don’t know what path.

When you talk about SME, are you talking in terms of a skill? For example, if I wanted to be a salesforce business analyst, knowing salesforce in the back of my head? Get salesforce certs? 

Or is it better to be a general Business Analyst who has some tech knowledge but not an expert but know the business inside out? 

I dont think im smart enough to be a deveoper that makes 300k+ but im stuck at this point in ny career.

Ive debated between:

1. Business analyst at a tech company
2. Get salesforce certs and work as a salesforce BA
3. Idk about project manager, my people skills are o-k. Which takes product manager out of the picture? 
4. Something to do with the cloud? Idk if I’d be smart enough for cloud architect lol plus 0 experience.

Not sure if there are other 6 figure tech jobs I could do. Data analyst I feel like it’s capped at like 80-90k whereas i do see some business analyst breaking that point.
Dude shut the fuck up with the pity party shit. You have skills and experience, you will find a decent job. 

There are millions, millions of people who are 10-20+ years older than you who have far less to offer than you do.

You can be a valuable asset to the world if you quit putting yourself down and stop letting the world walk all over you. I say this as someone who used to be on the very bottom of society- I put myself down there, I'm not a victim, I did it to myself. 

But I stopped blaming the world for my own problems and quit feeling sorry for myself and even though I'm still pretty far down the socioeconomic ladder I'm 10x what I used to be. 

The same can happen for you. So go make it happen.

empires last about 250 years. they go through six stages: pioneers, conquest, commerce, affluence, intellectual achievement, decadence.

and decadence is marked by ─

- debasement of currency
- economic crises
- public shows to distract the populace
- chefs as celebrities, emphasis on food pleasure (part of a vain search to recapture the old feeling of national greatness)
- apathy
- sexual obsession

It wants to go to 25…
My ex GF was a dumb ho but she was hot and she was artsy and now I don’t have a hot artsy GF to go to museums and watch movies with and sit on my face and it makes me sad
Why’d you break up if she was dumb and hot?
I was in a real shitty place in life, we’re very different people, probably should’ve broken up earlier tbh. 

This was just over 3 years ago now 🤷‍♂️
Well was she good in bed at minimum? And could you FWB her?
Hmmm complex answer. Terrible at riding but gave incredible head and she was a freak so I’d say overall very good sex. 

Did the FWB thing all lockdown but that kinda fizzled out and I don’t want to lose face by being the first to hit her up n’am say’n.
Artsy chicks are either wife material or whores. No in-between.
Yeah she’s pretty great. She says you had a small pp and mine is better. F

Risky 💅
485c 11/19 is blown up. I like the other 2 plays tho
Look at my TA chart & update yourself with Evergrande, it will make sense.
well, that first one is not going to help you with that plan
Nah China not going into a financial recession. You notice the market lag in the summer looking at the chart?
since options have both price and time components, looking at everything in the macro will not help you with the time aspect. You could be right but a week late and get nothing.
That’s why I got long calls to hedge, worth the risk
i really like all your others but the nov 19

Anyone else feel like this is a head fake and market will be flat or down eod?
Do people think ELON is done selling his shares? Not sure why $TSLA is up. 


He has 13mil shares to go.
Do people like you still think there’s a linear relationship between TSLA share price and how many shares musk had to sell? 

Yikes
> I love you
You sure are picky with your love
We don’t know how many he sold yesterday. He will probably be done selling today. 🚀
He just sold $1b and you think anyone cares about $13m? Lol
Sorry I meant to say 13 million shares. Not $13mil dollars. My bad.
I lost a lot of money I need a surefire 10 bagger play right now

Thinking delete my robinhood app so that i can 100% stop myself from gambling into options feel like drug
The trick is to just set aside gambling money from every check and not go beyond that threshold. Also make sure you’re maxing your 401k and Roth ira before you start gambling it’s not possible for everyone, but it’s the smartest approach. All of my gambling money comes after those two things are handled.
oh yeah same, my retirement accounts riskiest plays are holding stocks like aapl/nvda/amd with no intention of ever selling until i'm like 55+
Thank u bro it makes me feel better
Robinhood = Fun account. 401K/IRA/Legit Brokerage = Boring stuff
Yup boring buy and hold. Correct.
You need to delete your grammar teacher from your life first
Sorry bro english is my 2nd language and im really dumb
you should delete robinhood either way

I need spy to hit 470 tomorrow or my gambling ACC officially explodes
mine already imploded... now im here for the comments...
may i ask how much your down? lol
I invested about 10k total then I was up to around 15k then down to almost 6k then I got over 100k and thought I knew what i was doing and now I have about two pennies to rub together
I did take 10 k out before I lost it all so I guess im back to where I started? lol
jesus christ man . 100k to 0? thats fucking insane.  didn't you think to put some aside at least when you fell from 100 to 10k
> I lost all my money gambling on the roulette table.
If you aren't willing to sell when youre up there is probably no amount that would make you say ok yeah thats enough. Another problem was I watched my account blip from 120k then freeze then blip to over 500k then freeze and then drop massive after it opened up again. There wasnt much I could do and when i saw those numbers I was like I gotta get back up! lol
pretty much same here man, I made 30k in like 4 days from betting on spy calls. Then ofc I leveraged everything into one giant bet that could possibly triple my acc and yea........
Youll get back there man. Fuckin options bro lol
you too man. What's next for you after that big loss tho? are you planning on depositing more in the future and getting back in the game? haha
I told myself if I lost it all I wouldnt go back in, but its soo hard to stay away.... it whispers to me at night... lol I also got the mine equipment going day and night and at least that account is making me money vs this shit

PayPal is absolutely garbage.

There genuinely isn't a public company I consider less valuable than PayPal.

Shorting it to 0.
Weird I use PayPal almost daily and I like it
Wait till they openly admit to stealing your money.

I won't accept or deal with anyone that uses paypal
Never had any issues getting refunds through PayPal or anything like that not sure what you mean. Ive heard streamers get fucked through charge backs sometimes but that doesn’t affect me at all
I replied to another dude with my issue with PayPal.

They're the only company to ever admit to stealing my money and just saying "we don't have the tech to refund you"
Can you link to your reply to that other dude then? Would like to know more
I'll paste it.

PayPal is the only company to genuinely openly admit to stealing my money.

I had purchased an item on Ebay through PayPal that didn't arrive and ebay issued me a refund through PayPal but PayPal didn't process it correctly and eBay closed the case.

And PayPal were like "Sorry we've had a technical error we can't refund your money even though Ebay has authorised us to because the case is closed on their end"   Ebay kept saying they had sent it and PayPal kept saying even though Ebay have sent it the case is marked as closed so they can't give it to me. 

I had to get a charge back from my bank but PayPal literally said they were unable to give me my funds.

I won't use PayPal under any circumstances now I don't accept it for buying or selling.
Wow that’s fucked dude
It's even worse.  The seller genuinely had issues he wasn't trying to scam me so he admitted he couldn't post the item.  There was no dispute the money was taken from his account and PayPal were trying to pocket it ($350) 

This was in January 2020.  I got my money back from my bank but haven't used PayPal since.

Shorting to 0.

Fuck PayPal.
Good luck with that tho at least you have a good bank
Can u elaborate in a short post here why u think that? Genuinely curious as I’ve been thinking of buying the dip lately. I mean I use them and like them, simple service. Plus they have venmo on their side. What’s ur beef?

Bro wtf did PSFE ceo punch a baby or something?
They just saw how PRPL performed and wanted to do the same.
Elon sold 4.5 / 17 million shares he plans to sell. So 27%.
Yeah idk why that makes it moon
People only see that he sold so they assume he’s done
I mean, if it only gets down to around 1050 on him selling 20%, then immediately jump up to 1090 what'll it get down to, like 800 by the time he's done? Baby dip considering how quickly it ran up before, literally nothing worth worrying about, just buy, hold, average down, then forget about it for a few years.

This is not financial advice.
Yeah I kinda wanna fade this fake pump but puts are so expensive now. Might have to just do shares.

Do whatever you want until 30.
Wrong sub dude, but vary that diet.... you can get all the protein you need (and some extra cash) round the back of Wendies.
Yea your body gets too acidic I heard. Eat more poultry
Diet science is literal trash fyi.  There are very few things we definitively know about nutrition.  Excessive salt is bad.  Too much sugar is bad.  Excess calories are bad.  Hydration is good.  Vitamins and minerals are good (and better when gained through food).

Almost everything else is complete bullshit and based on stupid 30 people sample size studies with minimal controls.
BYND bro. It isnt that bad at all
no, that shit won't do anything to you until you hit 30 at least. enjoy it.
You'll be dead by 40 no matter what so why bother

Wow everyone who bought puts for anything are absolutely fucked
Mega fucked!
Fucking lost 20% yesterday and sold half my ford calls at the fucking bottom. Ended the day below 25k so now I have a day trade restriction. Now ford if back up... what the actual fuck
Doing nothing is half the battle broski.
Tell me about it. They were for 11/19 and 11/26 so it’s not like they were running out of time
What's really fucked up is the three day trade restriction is retroactive, so if you did for trades in the last week, you'll be asked to top it up or get locked.

But a call to your broker can unlock it, so don't sweat it too much.

Stop over trading
I have/had over 25k. I can day trade as much as I want. No reason to be limited if I have the money to do it. Obviously don’t have the balance now but still

ive had beyond burgers and theyre pretty good. you can sear them on a pan it acts just like meat and its also plant based. not a bynd holder just saying.

i like the burgers tbh

must mean S&P is gonna shoot up 50+ points on random nothing news. happened last march and one other time when everyone was short spy. Couldnt log in or sell and when i could log in i still couldnt sell. Watched my account get eviscerated in under an hour. gooood times...
Why would you want to log into Robinhood?
> Because you can trade stocks for free.
Are you Bulgarian?
You can do that with real brokers who don't fuck you on the daily. And the cool part of a real broker is that they actually purchase the shares when you put in a buy order.
So I can sell out of stocks and make money. I really need to switch brokers though, they;ve been pissing me off lately

Standard lunch rush on the east coast. It’s discount hour!
So puts on Rivian when options open?
IV will likely be too high to make a ton as it will likely collapse as the price moves down.

If you want to play it to the short side you'd want to either do straight stock or call spreads
I don't know why people say the Rivian truck and the Ford Lightning are in competition. The Rivian truck is double the price, smaller, has a longer battery range, and does 0-60 in 3 seconds. Whereas the Ford is much bigger, has more utility uses like serving as a generator to power your entire house during a blackout, is priced comparably to their current F-150s and again starts around 40k vs the Rivian 75k. 

They're for two completely different groups. Contractors and companies will absolutely buy the Ford for it's size and power bank functionality. And wealthier people who want a truck sized sports car will go with the Rivian.
Ford lacks the nefarious ambition of Jeff Bezos being obsessed with Elon.

People are
Playing on Bezos’ obsession with Elon.
No we are not. Stop projecting.
In order for me to project, I’d have to be playing Rivian and Ford.

Which I’m not. Dumped F positions yesterday for profit.
If i was a contractor id buy a Cybertruck. Great attention getter for the company.
I mean there's only Ford, Rivian, and Tesla (eventually) in the EV pick up game afaik so you're gonna have comparisons drawn

EDIT: I guess Toyota is interested in making their Tundra an EV so more comparable to the F150 but still a concept for now it seems
What about Lordstown and Foxconn? lol
Is *that* who fucking RIDE is? lmao Yeah wasn't aware of them so definitely more comparable to the F150 than Rivian's stuff
For now, only bc Ford has a backing as the good ol' 'Murican car company. These things change. It's the 21st century. Ford will still be around but these very 20th century companies are boomer companies. TSLA RIVN are the future.
So ur saying RIVN 200B?
Absolutely. If they can do what TSLA is doing and maintain a high demand with a small supply then their valuation could really take off. As a profitable automaker with a reasonable valuation, check back in 2030. But as s long as they stay in the speculative high growth area then their value could go over 200B.
Everyone arguing F and GM should be worth more don't realize the EV stocks will eventually tank bringing F and GM down too but not as much
That’s because when the main EV stock tanks (TSLA) the entire stock market shits the bed
GME is the Deathstar cooling vent 

It's a fucking Tendie Filled Piniata or TFP as the kids would say
Guys, stop selling! Think about Lorde Edge
He’s dumping on his cult….sad
so uhh tesla gonna do anything today?

Elon is a clout chaser, he made a poll but has always planned on selling his shares since September, he just wants more GenZ fan boys
Don’t make fun of Daddy Elon
it was a signal to retail. he was doing people a favor if you listened.
Yea but Tesla fanboys made it seem like a good thing.
What would he have done if the twitter poll voted No?
Cohens GME gag order ends in 2 weeks and he can speak for the 1st time. 

You're gonna fomo into GME at 350 in 2 weeks, you'd be smarter to get an entry here.
gag order?
Yeah he hasn't been allowed to talk for 1 year since he bought his stake. Was part of the takeover agreement for whatever reason
You sure? You said AMD was opening at $180 on Tuesday
SPY is going to drill at open, isn't it?
I guess so
And so the 10 day consecutive green day pattern resumes. SPY 500 by end of next week.
That's not what consecutive means. But go green!
People who slowly inch up at a red light the entire time until it’s green annoy the ever living shit out of me why didn’t you just get close enough and stop like every other normal person
You’re soft for being annoyed by petty shit

For those who are under the age of forty and have grown up in the United States or Europe, inflation is an abstraction, a number that governments report on and experts talk about, but not something that is central to their investing or regular lives. For those who are older or grew up in countries with high inflation, inflation is far more than a number, wreaking havoc on savings and exposing fault lines in economies and societies.
True. A painful side effect of inflation is high interest rates. This will hit you hard if you borrow to buy a house or car.

Youd be a dumb ape to buy 3k in dispo pre rolls
no shit, i dont have to lol
Love that. Enjoy the smoke dawg
No electric, seed, medium, fertiliser cost?
ive had the setup for a couple years now, so yea maybe $5 worth of nutes and maybe $10 for electric
Only $725 for 7.25oz here in Florida from the dispo.
wow i guess your taxes are super low?
No tax on medical weed ✌️
Futes rippin
IV crush on Sofi should be sweet for put and calls sellers alike :)
IV crush on ur life would be better.
lol. What an ass
So glad I closed my puts before close. Hoping my shares moon now.
Futes ain’t shit but hoes and tricks
Oh Pfizer shill deleted all his comments. Guess he didn’t like being called out.
Mrna to 500?
Oh cool shocker market is green as shit and my puts are dead what the fuck
Yup back to regularly scheduled pump easy
Just wait
For more put losses? Gotcha
I want to get back into TSLA but I feel like this pump is MM's trying to hand their bags off to retail....back to losing money I guess.
It’s 100% a fake pump
Thanks, I take solace in knowing if I am crazy at least I am not the only one.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
People are desperate to cling to hope but if it somehow does moon to ATH that will just be time to short it again. “Oh Elon sold a small part? We must be done!” Makes no sense.
The beautiful bounce back
$ROOT crushed earnings
Should've bought calls on everything yesterday.
That’s what I’m saying. Going be a green day .
We didn't have a red day for long I thought it would last another day, at least.
Everyone panic sold because of Evergrande. Look at the data from when it was released they were "defaulting" (bad journalism) and then look at when they paid the bonds.. after market close everything sky rocketed.
Ahh thanks for the extra info. :).Evergrande defaulting has been feared for awhile. I'm surprised someone actually published saying they DID default without proper DD.
It's speculated this was done so Evergrande could short the market.  Everyone was on edge prior to this news. That, or journalism majors need a new fucking job on reporting facts and bullshit.
shoulda coulda woulda
Let me regret in peace 😔
what plays are you thinking about today?
Well I was planning on getting a monthly call on AFRM if we had another red day but it's already up.

Might pickup SQ leap since it's been going down so much. You?
I have 5k to yolo in an FD. Trying to decide what it will be.... any suggestions? no fun earnings to play and I have holding weeklies over the weekend. I feel like peleton puts are a safe bet? idk
Peleton is already down 46% in less than a week, you think it'll have room to fall more? I usually don't buy puts after a harsh fall and it looks like a really slow fade.

If you want to buy puts I would wait until WISH goes up a little more. I'm holding shares and it keeps dipping below $5 when it tries to test the $5.50 mark.
I already have wish puts that I bought on Monday :) but it’s a small position. Ape tickers are always risky. Not sure if I would risk 5k on it even tho it’s a horrible company
Oh that's good! Yeah I don't usually bet against ape tickers either. Are you looking to just buy puts or are you open to other strategies? If you just want to buy yolos/fds then TSLA is a good one bc it swings so much. Think it might go up even tho Elon sold.
> I am open to other strategies. I have an algorithm that can be used for hedging, but it is very complicated and requires a lot of data so I don't use it at this time.
Stfu
Tesla FDs it most likely is :) will see how it reacts after open then decide
Ok hope you make lots of tendies! Sorry if you don't.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Buy puts this time so you can go to 0
Don't double dare me.
DO IT!! Triple dare you
I'll do the opposite to spite you.
If you shart today you're not a good patriot
What if you have ibs? Asking for a friend 🥺
All or nothing. Worst comes to worst, it's not a shart if you commit to shitting yourself
Fair enough, shitting myself now 😎
I bought calls yesterday, I hope you did too
Oh yeah, I bought calls. 

DIS calls..
:O
A truly retarded position in DIS 11/19 $180c
hey i did that too
You thinking they’re gonna be .01 on open?
I think they're gonna be -$.20 and we'll actually owe money for being stupid enough to think mickey wasn't gonna fuck us
We got *Mick dicked*
If it's over $1 i'll probably dump it. anything less and there's no point in not holding it to see if it recovers next week
I’m in the same camp. Hoping it’s worth over 1$ so I can sell it. Revenue was good, guidance was good, but they missed by pretty much every other metric.
I put in a $1 limit order. I'm doubtful it'll even fill with that but fingers crossed my friend
I have $185c 20 of them but hedged with puts
Bought my first baby contract for 26 dollars on INO and watched it tank to 18 in an hour. 

Woohoo! 8 days left.
I bought SPY calls for $130 Tuesday. They're currently at $7 and expire tomorrow
DIS getting WACKED, time to buy
Wonder if it will drop more before.
major trend line support at $163.20
Why has it kept dipping?
True, however this market does not abide by any trends. Who know what’s going to happen. It’s also mooned on no news before as well.
HUT Earnings up 40% yoy, 110% revenue increase, lowered debt by $39%. New partnerships brought in $500 million cash flow.

The rocket is launched
Hey, thanks for the leak comment yesterday, I bought 3k stocks because of you.  


Here's a gold! Thanks for the info!
Psyched - wish I had went in harder but ran out of funds buying the dip yesterday
They have an earning call?
Buyer - $CVX, $ASO, $AAPL, $NVDA
Weedstonk run comin
Yup. Charts looking great
SOFI saving my ass today.
I have yet to lose money selling short AMC vertical call spreads.
It's pretty smart, IV is hella high compared to realized and historical volatility.

Easy to get greedy and eventually get smashed though.
Evergrande doesn't matter.

A potential default has been global news for months. When the train is moving that slowly, people have time to get off the tracks. Any risk of wider impact or collapse is long gone.
Lehman's collapse was obvious for over a year but the market didn't give a shit.

Still i think you're right. Evergrande isn't another 2008.
It’s not exclusively evergrande related news coming out. Debt ceiling talks, inflation, labor shortages. Could be a bumpy ride during this traditionally bullish few months. Kind of a bummer but who knows how shit will play out.
so fucked with paysafe and clov..any help guys...![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)

Cant be in all the plays dawg
Everyone ensure you jack off for post-nut clarity before making any rash decisions. 

Or if you want just get calls and chill.
So now it's confirmed that Elon is selling, bag-holders are buying
We have to help Lord Musk! It’s not fair if he has to sell below 1k
Bro wtf are these overreactions you miss an earnings by 2% and you’re valuation gets sliced by a third 🤡
It’s almost as if a lot of shit is currently overvalued.
Go Elon go go go!  We autists are getting taken on a space ship to Mars.  I'm almost crying thinking about it.

Edit: $1 now
I sold all my $AAPL in July and bought COST and NVDA at the time. Probably the best decision I made this year. $AAPL is the big tech lame name.
Elon just gonna let it go up to 1100 again before selling another block.  Rinse, recycle, repeat.

Wsb: omg were drilling omg demon dildos
You mean the people whining about media manipulation of stocks are also manipulating via media, such as fudposting?
Bought SPY calls & puts, I can’t lose right?
Why is tech dumping
Everything rally combined with Santa claus rally is coming
Because it's way way way overbought over the last month. Needs at least a few days of correction.

When can we buy puts on Rivian ?
No kidding. 

No options on new issues until at least three business days after IPO date. [Source](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/072104.asp)

IPO was 11/10. Earliest options available is 11/15, Monday.
I'm out. Sold my FB calls. Oof
THANK YOU

335 eod
Riot is 8% up and its options are up 20%.
MARA up 9%
I will stfu for the rest of the year if SPY closes above 465
SNOW leaps puts? This piece of shit has pumped almost 100% since may for no reason. Trading at 110x revenue. I don’t see any way it can continue with this multiple next year when rates rise.
> Yeah. I've been shorting it for weeks now.
HOLD THE LINE HERE SPY AND UP WE GO
SoFi makes my pp so harddd
Working as a software dev is the best some weeks. This week i might havd worked 4 hours of real work out of 4 days from home and people are still satisfied with my work
Goals
Bootcamps worth it?
idk i did software engineering undergrad. but if you only do bootcamps you will have to do some personal projects and share your github to interviewers probably
Okay ... okay not this time... just a little bit... just a small amount on 1 option... just 1 little opt.... WOOOHOO JACK TO TITS WOOAHHH.... annnnd its gone
Did you (we) ever consider that you (we) might have a problem?
I didnt figure that out until I lost the over 100k that I made on a lottery play. Can you believe I actually thought I knew what I was doing? Hahaha oh yeah its def a problem
35k for me. Same deal
I need to take a fat piss. My balls are going to look like raisins afterwards
Pee is stored in the balls
Piss is stored in the prostate ya regard!!!
At this point, WISH should just cease operations and invest their remaining 1.1B in SPY and make anywhere from 10-20% profit a year! They’ll actually make consistent money for once!
I got a feeling SPY is gonna dump EOD but be green from then on out
staying between $464-67 til Monday then we’ll see it run a little bit mostly stay around $470
will my amd calls going up?
SDC, ROOT, WISH, SNDL: if you have one or more of these stocks in your memefolio, you need to evaluate your memevesting strategy.
I’m short SDC. Bear Call Spread. Theta ganging that shit.
Best strategy IMO. IV is high so don't want to be buying options straight up.
Why not just say if you have any of these?
I don't know. What the fk do I know? These questions are making me upset.
It's alright lebron your just a Flopper, we understand
Oh, hello NVDA, welcome back!
Nvda heard u talking shit sup bro
$RIDE going to $2 after earnings release
AMD baby. Pump!
Really sold my AMD calls down 70% this morning hours ago FML
Same. But i ended up with nvda calls instead 🙃
Damn tip
Anyone have an opinion on SNDL and the earnings ? Supposedly 300m shares on loan? Idk I'm just a crayon eating noob.
Going to be an eye opener to many whales once the Q3 results comes out. Load up.. you will thank yourself later!! Q3 will be good but Q4 will be epic. Getting in early is key. nfa
All personal opinions aside they have a disgusting amount of cash on hand
Grabbed 2024 PSFE calls, they reach 100 I become Millionaire
i love that this travis scott shit is bringing back satanic panic

maybe this will get the conspiracy theorists shunned from proper society again after getting too accepted because of covid shit
not likely after how right we have been proven the past 2 years, you used to comment with us - what happened?
conspiracy theorists are scum i got banned from the sub for being correct about the sub being a hub for far right brainlessness that is good for literally nothing
haha, sorry to hear about the ban, censorship is virtually always wrong.
i broke the rules of calling out the sub so it makes sense

it was a long time coming tbh i only perused that sub to troll those brainlets anyways
yeah, I remember, just recognized the username is all
Honestly considering only buying on red days from now on. Every time I buy on a green day I get burned
TSLA 1000P FDs are cheap if any one wants to roll the dice
Damn if that hits
u/AxemanFromMA and anyone else buying the 12/31 500c - if you plan on holding those anywhere near to the date of expiration, you’re basically betting on SPY going up almost $40 between now and then. Look at the amount SPY has moved between 11/10 and 12/31 for the last few years. 

In 2018, SPY went *down* by about $20 between those dates

In 2019, SPY went up by about $11 between those dates

In 2020, SPY went up by about $15 between those dates

I’m not saying it can’t happen because it could, but it seems pretty unlikely. Yes, growth speed has accelerated, but still. If we get a few really big days in the next couple of weeks, $7-$10 days or something, you’ll probably be good, but if shit continues like it has been the last couple weeks those contracts are fucked.
Just gamblin
What about my 12/23 500 calls
Those should be fine
axemanFromMa is fucking clown who has a very limited grasp of how the market works. Not saying i'm some scholar over here but that guy is a true fucktard
https://ibb.co/dBqtBwt

You don’t understand. The market lag in the summer was because of Evergrande/China (second highest GDP) going into a possible reccesion till of last night. We have Build Back Better coming in and Nov/Dec/Jan are the most bullish months. Also the market is still in the COVID bubble.
lol stop linking that chart dude it doesn’t prove shit. Yes, Nov/Dec are bullish months and yet look at how much SPY has moved up between today’s date and Christmas over the last several years. Nowhere even close to the amount you’re betting it will. 

As far as Build Back Better, this is exactly like all your other dumb imaginary catalysts. First you said the debt ceiling thing was gonna save your 10/15 calls and that didn’t work out. Then you kept saying the infrastructure deal was going to make SPY explode. Infrastructure deal passed over the weekend and SPY has done nothing but drop until today, and it looks like it might end red today. What makes you think Build Back Better is going to be different? You were so certain those other two things would be massive catalysts for SPY to explode and you were 100% wrong both times.
dude don't even bother arguing with this dude. He's a straight up window licker.
I know, it’s so unsatisfying. I just want him to see reason but it’s no good, he just links that dumb chart and refuses to actually address any specific points. Lol. I’ll just leave him to his madness
Yeah but but but my TA 😁😁🤡just keep calling him a fucking clown. You just can’t reason with stupid haha
Bagholder spotted.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Go ahead. Inverse me, lets see whos right.
Oh, I do think SPY is gonna go up and we’re get a Christmas rally. Those contracts are just way too far OTM to print
Not based on my TA.
lol. Okay man. When those expire worthless don’t say you weren’t warned. 

About a week ago when I brought up your 10/15 450c you said “I was retarded then, I learned” but this 12/31 500c is the exact same type of play. You didn’t learn anything and something tells me after these 500c expire worthless you still won’t learn the lesson lmao
You do realize I can sell before $500 and make money right?
Of course. If you read my original comment you saw I said “if you plan on holding anywhere near to expiration”. 

But those are way OTM. To make any real amount of money on them you’re gonna need some big moves soon with very little pullback. We’ll see.
fucking clown
What’s your ACT score? -10000?

PYPL and ROKU. Both criminally oversold. PYPL to $300 by eoq 1 and ROKU to $500 by then 🚀 🌙
Jumped out of both of those sinking ships at a loss a month ago. Surprised to see them still drilling, but am also glad I got out.

Yeah, cash account
No i was notified by my brokerage i would get a good faith violation on my cash account because cash wont settle today

Its getting boring. Probably take couple of days off on wsb. This is my second to last comment for this morning
I’ve seen at least 3 comments since this one.
soooo did evergrande default or not?
They paid like 2 out of the 23 bonds they owe. Everyone keeps reporting they didn’t really default because of it.
Tuesday could be a green day, but it won't set a new all time high unless I'm still getting bamboozled

Ford is due for a rally today - added $8B to market cap yesterday and baby got thrown out with the bath water on the market downturn.
Let's hope so...I mean Rivian has a larger market cap than F...illogical to me.

.....and PSFE continues to pile drive me deeper into the hole. Down 64% since Steve Grasso recommended it. I should have paper handed this thing when I was 10% down.....or 15% down....or 20% down.....or 30% down......or 40% down.....maybe 69% down will be my number.

F # @ !
Wait till 100% loss so you get nice tax break
I'll probably be stupid enough to wait until it hits 69 cents and quadruple down!
I am currently at 69.18% down (that came fast)....I'm still holding, so....nope 69% down was not my number.

Maybe it is time to learn about puts. With my luck, I'll buy a put and it will go up 69%

Well by the looks of that big red candle after announcing earnings, im going to go out on a limb and say their earnings were bad.

What are you gonna do? How much damage you in for?
Down 8k on my 3k shares and who knows on my leaps when market opens lol
Hey, I just checked back to see PSFE decimated. Did you sell? How heavy are your bags? I’m down a shit ton
holy FUCK thank god i only went in for 100 shares at 9

Sell covered calls 1 dollar OTM till they get called away lol
the only smart thing i did last week was buy $VALE at the bottom 🚀 UP UP AND AWAY
tfw you meant to buy puts on PSFE and forgot because of meetings all day
I could use making some money in the market today, would help me a lot. Let's hope.
I'm so glad I sold PSFE at $13 just to breakeven a few months back 😂😂
Such an oof stock. The SPAC overpaid to bring it public
When you guys stop buying PSFE then it will bounce

SPY doing a show of force against Tesla, so far whenever TSLA has dumped SPY has joined it, show Musk we dont give a shit if he fails
If you’re buying spy you’re buying tesla

Tell me your 0dte lotto nonsense
ICLN with new bill soon
ICLN is largely non-US and will not benefit greatly from the infrastructure bill. 

You also suggested me an ETF play based on upcoming legislation when I asked for 0dte lotto nonsense. Totally unacceptable.
I'm up 80% since writing this on the 1dte 🤷‍♂️
what bill? I thought it was infrastructure?
>nonsense
What’s the play?
Slightly otm calls for next week, pretty otm calls this month. This is a pure retard play, hence why I'm confident
What could possibly be pumping the Russell besides hard dick and bubblegum
The fact PYPL has been going down since late July is just hilarious. Lmao I don’t even feel like my 2/18/22 are even safe anymore
I bought the dip, and it kept dipping
Pls Chgg dont do this to me.
revenue side is going to be trouble for a while. they literally may have peaked in the US, and market hates buying slow growth / descent. 

it could get really ugly.
Anyone buying TWTR?
Still not back to my ROOT cost basis. Even after selling CC. FML.

467 and 468 spy calls bought Monday. Hold to tomorrow praying for a rebound. Or sell today for monster losses?
hold we going to melt up
I like your optimism
when's expiration? if it's this week then take the losses, otherwise hold
They expire tomorrow. Theta can chance to be in the money. At this point it’s probably a loss no matter what. But right now it’s a big loss. A little loss would be better. I bet big on uppies and it went downies.
that sucks

I learned my lesson to never buy weeklies, only sell them while buying leaps

good luck to you sir
Is PSFE gonna report their earnings or what ????
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
BYND out here getting taken to the butcher.
good product, terrible company
Eyeballing BLNK idk where to go with it tho
here comes the pain
If RKLB reports strong earnings and launches successfully Monday, the stock is going to absolutely explode
And if they don’t nail both of those things it’s going to die a horrible death.
Earnings on the 15?
Yeah earnings AM on Monday and the launch is planned for Monday night (in US time, so midday Tuesday in NZ)
Waiting on the NASDAQ to die so we can commence the dump
I see green but nothing is happening. Fake and 🌈
yes it is fake but market won’t actually crash until new year

RBLX round 2
I'm not doubting it again. Hate the stupid game but millions of others do.
It's not even a game, look on youtube, people are making their own story telling videos, and they're pretty funny.
Should I just hold my wish outside overnight
Does a satellite smartphone make me cool?

-sent from my Pi phone
I told you a month ago that Wish was despite how cliche it sounds a low downside, high upside play, but everyone called me a bagholder.
People over use the term bag holder. I’ve bought and sold wish multiple times for profit. It’s pretty clear where the floor is.
I agree. Not $50 but for sure not $5. What surprised me is the hate against this stock. Everybody is so happy it is going down and that people are losing money. Some dynamics in social media are very strange
RBLX is such a B word
So LNG is out and uranium is back in? I can't keep up with the hip and groovy trends these days.
What's the story on RIVN?
Ipo pump.  I’m going to get in some long positions next week or the week after personally

Yup every day is just a slow bleed

Yeah I bought 200 more shares Tuesday. Think I'm going to get some more December 17 $70 calls. This seem like a major over reaction at this point.

Hold steady lunch time dip possibly then we moon
NKLA boys it’s happening
Did they find a way to roll the stock uphill?
> Yes, they did. They used a ball bearing and an inclined plane. The experiment was successful but the company went bankrupt due to lack of funding for further development (the stock market crashed).
VMod. 🧠
Yes they found out they can pull it up the hill with a rope and 25 strongmen. Truly groundbreaking
Not a real company.
It’s still real to me Goddamit
Fine.. fake company, real pain. Hope you profit !
If plug could hit 45 mañana that’d be tight
DASH puts feel like a pretty good intraday play right now
I called it yesterday.  It was 7% shorted and there were a crap load of 11/12 ITM calls created by the surprise jump in price following the earnings report.
Why would you flirt with a breakout? Better off playing roulette
It's already up 8% with nothing material backing it and it's perpetually volatile. A small retreat today during the day is a more reasonable gamble than most things on the roulette table
Honestly Roblox is a game full of terrible low quality games, but kids love it.
Thinking if I hold my spy 11/29 470c I bought like 2 weeks back… should have sold on fri but I didnt

Nothing like losing a thousand and chasing it just to lose another thousand ……humbling experience 🤡
I was down $12K yesterday but an selling option  prematurely for a $300 loss hurt me more today.
Currently down 12k. Hoping something recovers

(I want to buy the dip but it looks like a sad staircase down to shitsville)
imo anything under 25 is fair; anything above is overpriced.
If you like it then get it gee
>(I want to buy the dip but it looks like a sad staircase down to shitsville)

Their aquisition of smaller companies like SCUF, Elgato, etc has helped them carve out a name for themselves in a market full of giants like logitech. They have also been adament that last years increase in revenue was not just a fluke from the rona. They expect demand to actually be higher than last year and are estimating they will make 1.9 billion to 2.1 billion in revenue. (A 17% increase from last year)
Their Y/Y stats for Q3 report were dogshit. You’re saying that for 2022 they are actually expecting to exceed 2020 revenue?
The CEO already stated they expected growth to slow for the ladder half of 2021. Their Q3 was underwhelming, but they mainly cited supply chain difficulties as the issue, not volume of customers. Shipping cost and GPUs are digging into their revenue, but they were pretty adament that they would be able to achieve at least a 7% growth from last year on the conservative side, even if things do not improve.
I should just force myself to buy puts alongside my calls if I’m gonna lose this much money Jesus

Just got margin called Virgin... Thanks
Cmon blockhead break rip through 100 already lol
Dude so grateful to see the shorts finally get theirs on $PTRA. We finally had a good day with the Infra bill coming out and then the next day boom 43% short interest. They were banging their chests on the boards and had wiped out our gains... until earnings...🤑🚀
People are buying a ton of phony dog poo off of WISH today. Moon motherfucker!
portfolio is on a moderate WMW recovery from yesterday. all green, but only +$100 on the week lmao 


please go up SPY
SOFI and BROS doing me right so far…maybe I’ll go see if the new BROS location down the street is open…
Its the worse thing when u know how good it is but they take 5+ months to build and staff
Still not open, so I went to and supported a local business with the same type business model.  Will probably continue to support the local business more than the corp chain…
So Mara is back to where it was before earnings dump and I'm down 30%. Fuck IV.
Puts on small no name pharma stocks pre-earnings is just free money

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/robmiller656 (0/1) made a bet that SNDL would go to 0.75 when it was 0.6547 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Pay was not safe. PSFE down 41%
Gonna try to take profit or low losses and go cash gang. Partly for uncertain markets but mostly cuz I can't seem to trade well getting off of night shift. Guh
probably a good idea, I'm expecting some craziness before Thanksgiving.
I guess it's also gang witching week or whatever, monthly call expiry 11/19. I think that tends to increase the volatility
Holy shit PSFE. Sold at $10 for a 30% loss a few months ago and almost bought back in at $7.25. Dodged a bullet there. Wonder what the bottom will be. Seems like a good time to get back in but shit has gone down nonstop since the merger.
Is it even a good company?

I'm thinking mid 3's
Really hope these PSFE Jan2023 $5c pay off. Only way I’m recouping this week’s losses is landing a 10 bagger
Cmon IWM. Keep going up
If you’re not buying this dip on Disney then you aren’t a believer in the dreams of little children everywhere
Coupang earnings better be good today. I'm down 90% on 4 month old leaps. Just want like 25% of it at this point

Anyone else soaking up POSH?
Out of all of the scams that dipped yesterday, I had to buy the one that didn't pump 4% today.
Almost time for a margin er I mean margarita call!  Lol
FSR ripping.  This should hit $25 tofah
bond market closed so there’s nothing to remind investors that they are retarded
Looks like market is going sideways / consolidating, probably until Monday. Guess I’ll do some work and stop watching the ticks. Probably for the best. Could use some low vol after crazy past few weeks
Thank god GayME showing signs of life I was busy at work and didn’t have time to sell my calls on that last pump
Banks are closed it’s a fake AF trading day!
Trying to decide how to best lock in SoFi leap gains. Would setting a stop limit order at a set profit percentage be the best way to accomplish this?
Sounds legit, try not to lock in severe losses with stop losses
Who else is leap $RIDE-ing? It definitely seems as though its at a bottom and just was given $50mil
Your thoughts on ER beat/miss
Barely beat or barely miss - but probably with some positive news... gotta speculate they can take up more market cap in the EV space eventually as long as they are making progress... I think anything close will be positive
Tricky indeed
That triple bottom in FUBO looks tastyyyyyyyy
Paysafe shit the bed that bad?
Yes THAT bad.
Gonna look at the earnings.
PSFE leaps on deck bois, no way this goes bad
I said that 6000 shares ago. Welcome to the club.
I got 10 of the $6 leaps lol
I got shares and calls (they’re cheap af) in RIDE, in the green so far, thinking to close before ER today, do you think they beat or miss? Thanks
What earnings? Have they sold a single truck?
> Yeah, they're in the black.
Wow bruh, you’re genius
The ease at which PayPal allows boomers to buy c.r.y.p.t.0 makes me very bullish. Probably going to write some CSPs
Need a 0dte play
GOLD calls all day long
Spy has some bullish formations but I’m waiting still, if it takes off I’ll atleast close my puts temporarily
Its circle jerking but does looks like it gonna boom in coming hours
We traded pretty flat just like this yesterday... until noon.
You had to say it, didn't you. And there goes SPY...down the shitter.
SPY 1M and 3M looking spooky
Fast Money boys/girls coming on soon to tell everyone to keep their money in the market so they can get out before interest rate rise next year

Lol

!remindme 1 month
Is a sports betting company? Not talking about price or direction, just your statement.
That is the direction it is going. Just bought a 4m subscriber company in France.

They offer live odds and betting through the app on the game you're watching. Just opened apps in two states and plan on expanding to every state. 

The major focus of the FuboTV app is sports with a bit of a focus on soccer which is only growing and they are going to parlay it in to becoming a sports betting company to boost profits.
OK. Didn't know that. Gonna do some research.
Flood Gates are about to burst on FSR!  I'm mildly sweaty rn
Should I just all in BRK.B?  Yes, I’m poor.
If you do that be sure to call up geico and demand a discount. No joke, 8% off your insurance for holding that
There is literally no human being on Earth who does not qualify for that discount.  Used to be 15%, too.  If you can't bring yourself to say "I'm a Berkshire shareholder" over the phone to some phone droid who will not verify and who could care less, there are over 800 other ways to get the discount, like having once been gestated in a womb, or being a card-carrying Breathairean.
FCEL is on 🔥
It certainly is!! I see it in the 15-20 range by December

Man I'm stoked about FSR now, just wait til Cars hit the road!
I've been holding shares since it was called SPAC, it's nice to see it break out of the mundane 10-20 channel it was stuck in
That's awesome.  I'm a tiny fish with 400 shares at $15.86.  First year trading tho. So not bad I guessm.
Why is it pumping today been holding shares for awhile forget why i have them lol
Infrastructure bill passed.  EVs are cool.

I am incredibly bullish on geni and it’s been shitting the bed recently. If you like the idea of the plantair of sports betting, I’d pick some up now before earnings
I think you're the only bull on that one mate.
It has made me a lot of money and I see sports betting as a growing sector, but any advice on here is likely detrimental to your financial well-being

fsr is taking off hard I predict its going to 27
I guess I shouldn't have rejected the church. I don't know how, but this universal force always manages to send my winners too the god damn moon when I take measly profits but always shuts my shit down when I hold out for more. There's a karmic force that wants to keep me down. I'm sorry, Jesus :(
Why are you punishing the rest of us for his sins, Jesus?!?
Your weekly calls are wrekt. I hope my 11/19s are fine.

 Wow rip spy
Will you stop going down for once FB???
😔
I switched to calls without day trades at the very top, sold puts to do it
Sooooo I have calls almost worthless ...my question to you experts is do I have to SELL those contracts at a loss to claim the loss for lower taxes, or can I just hold them to expiry and still claim the loss?
Double down

Two negatives equal a positive
Doesn’t matter. If you sell early or let them expire worthless. A loss is a loss
Holding to expiry is fine.
it will be taken into account for your yearly p/l so yeah but might as well sell them and go get a chipotle brisket burrito
This makes so much more sense than a few bucks related to taxes.

Yes, i'm thinking 4.20 is a good price for my psfe stonks. Jolly good, govnor!
I'm always either 1 day too early or 1 day too late. RIP to my potential imagination profit
When riv options?
I’d buy puts immediately
I’ll sell you some puts
5 day minimum waiting period, the company has to apply in the first place, and there's a price threshold

mind you, I think RIVN is above the price threshold
If plug continues to pump I’ll be happy
3 more years of pump, plug is going to be a huge player very soon
Weird day AFRM gave a bunch of PM gains back and BROS and MQ gave it all back for some reason
all going into SOFI
SOFI is my biggest holding so I'll take it I guess LOL
Anything special for this ASTS business update planned for 11/15?
Stimulants or depressants on NVDA earnings next week?
Both
Becky Index hanging on for dear life.
People have ceremonies to renew their vows right?

What if F, GM, VW re-IPO?

If RIVN is 130 bil then I'm sure those three can get better than current caps

TM, HMC and Hyundai? Who cares about those three lol
The battle for 464 wages on.
Any end of day plays?
SNDL

Oatly calls, $12.50’strike, will print large on earnings next week. That is all
Man that massive GE move evaporated fast lol
Stupid AFRM.  Should have sold a lot sooner

Killing it with RIDE, am a super idiot 😆
Dwac, tsla, pypl, sq all need to get with it. 

Ptra is awesome today!!!
I sold PLUG before earnings 🤡
So far my RIDE and BLINK yolos working out. Up 122% and 26%. Hopefully they both crush earnings tonight cuz I can't sell beforehand due to no day trades left ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
I'm setting up stops right now, something doesn't feel right with this
Is the info on PSFE really correct? Do they only have 4 employees?

That can’t be right at all.
Wasn’t looking at PSFE for a while since I sold with loss at $7. What happened to it? What a shithouse of a stock..
They have no idea how to make profit nor how to increase revenue. Don’t touch it for now
Matterport is printing today! Up 7%
Do you accept, cash? Ka-Ching
When did you get a CD player?
Got out of SAVE by the skin of my teeth. GEEZ, i thought reopening play was solid?
It worked in Feb to March....maybe in 2022??
I was hoping holiday travel. But there was an article out warning about how holiday travel will be highly canceled and delayed this year due to labor shortage. So I think you are right, spring break travel maybe.
Spy just got kicked in the nuts
Thinking about going deeper into riot
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
the downside to investing in spy options is it just moves with tesla so if tesla isn’t skying, s&p ain’t moving for shit. which means 12/1 475 is a legit target
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
They say stocks only go up but I’m convinced there’s more pussy sellers than buyers
BA really does not want to go back to 230

If BYND boxes didn't get rained on it'd be at $100 and the forecast doesnt include more rain so
Is the dump in PaySafe justified? Seems like a fraud/bankruptcy dump more than disappointing numbers.
Someone took paysafe out behind the dumpster at Wendy’s for some sloppy top

Whats the $root thesis?
Beat earnings. Its a highly shorted stock.
If it goes up, people buy it, so it goes up, so people buy it
DD: Money is the ROOT of all evil. And it feels real good to be bad >:)  


^(jk, no idea. not even in that one, just wanted to make that pun)
Pfizer still not approved in China, any time soon? Expecting Pfizer stock jump 30% on that

Edit: Fosun a government strongly connected Chinese firm bought the distribution license from Pfizer last year
China will just steal the recipe and name it lebron
> Pfizer is a pharmaceutical company. The Chinese government has banned the import of drugs for profit since 1994, so Pfizer's business in China will be limited at best.
Fosun bought the distribution license from Pfizer long time ago
Both of these things are never happening
China is using Chizer my guy.
Does China even pay for their Windows OS ?
I thought windows were illegal in China?
Don't they already have their own? What the likelihood that they accept a competing product in the market?
China approving a US vaccine when they  have their own. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)

You didn’t sell yet oh my
Im not in it but i know many retards here are as you guys were pumping it a couple of months back
Well now that we know the infrastructure bill was priced in, what’s the next catalyst for SPY? I think it’s going to be sideways until consumer spending increases (Black Friday).
More tapering and interest rate rises are the next catalyst. Aren’t they?
> I think the next catalyst for SPY is a combination of tax reform and infrastructure spending.
Jerome Powell renomination
I think from now on inflation expectations will drive the market.
I agree with you actually.
I'm just waiting for IV to drop for my quarterly ROOT puts to print as always

This infrastructure bill is gonna pass, have a look at JKS. This infrastructure bill is gonna pass, FAN options are cheap. I got them a few months out and nearly ITM because it takes a lot to move a whole ETF.

Would you rather have 10 shares of PSFE or a really tasty sandwich
Shares and ramen bro
get your bidets ready
pls let dis get shrek boners during power hour
Not selling my puts early today. Got a feeling this afternoon and tomorrow are bear days. Got my SOFI profit. Time to ride these QQQ puts.
I have a feeling BLNK is gonna drill, but given my earnings trade history this week, it is certain to moon
Let’s see Grwg finish green
Blink earnings or f45 training earnings
Come on RIOT, break that 40
MARA 🚀

Is Amazon gonna continue to tank? I’m eyeing 3400P
Okay now I seriously need to know what the fuck NEGG is doing
Currently? It's going down :(

Was too scared to check port today. Just got the courage. Recession cancelled! Bears r fuk!
Common PLUG.  One more push.
Anyone playing tsm? Loaded up on April calls seem cheap
honestly love playing channels like this. 108-125-108, rinse and repeat. will probably go one way or another soon and fuck me but until then huzzah!

i would hold off on those leaps until it breaks over 125.
today was eerily flat
How bout now
It's been a decent day to play some quick DASH options as the price has gone back and forth between 227 and 232.
What did you buy today that you wish you waited until EOD to buy?
> I bought a bunch of XMR at $200. I wish I waited until EOD to buy because it is currently trading at $230
Lol
Peace of mind
ROOT is such a shittyy stock.  Negative gross margins. Burns like $150mm of cash per quarter. Only \~6 quarters of cash left. Will have to sell more equity
i approve this message.
May as well add some VXX calls to my SPY puts. Diversify.
When it does the worst during first and last hour that means institutions are selling but retail and day traders are buying.
Spy u absolute POS
Do I grab NVIDIA calls for next week tomorrow or Monday
Wait a couple weeks
buy today before close, sell at open after AH/PM pump. buy more at close friday
Spy is at a third of normal volume and we’re barley holding on to gains…tomorrow looking like a bloodbath

There was a guy that did like a 10 part PSFE dd last week all the same stuff applies he even said that this earnings would be bad so i sold couple days ago gonna hop back in maybe monday
k ty will look at it this night, if you have a link would appreciate it though although i guess if i use the sausages i call fingers i should be able to find on my own

EDIT: TY
Their core product is not growing and they are losing money and market share to better competition. Company is worthless, it wouldn’t crash this hard if the writing wasn’t already on the wall. Take a gamble if you want, but companies with much more legitimate businesses like V and PYPL are sliding as well and those actually have a chance to rebound
Tempted to jump into PSFE as well
i´ll look into it first but y i love falling knifes its just a passion i guess, just today my disca is starting to see green since i catched it after the hwanggammedon
Just trust the process ladies and gents.

Buying puts is a form of subconscious self-sabotage. Know the signs; consider therapy.
Nah man. Made like 250% flipping SPY puts yesterday. You just need to know when to get out... bulls win long term
Burry commenting on Musk calling TSLA stock “overpriced” last year is the most disingenuous BS. 


As if that tweet could possibly be taken as an honest statement.
It is overpriced, doesn’t mean it can’t go up
It might be overpriced but pointing to that tweet as evidence is just absurd. Burry absolutely knows Musk didn’t tweet that because he actually thought the stock was overvalued
Burry has been consistently making the point that tesla is overpriced, and it is, not because of a tweet.
No he specifically cited the fucking tweet, I don’t care what his other claims are, he knows that is bullshit lol.

It weakens his credibility when he adds dumb shit like that to his case. Plenty of non bullshit reasons to say it’s overvalued.
Making a comment on the tweet doesn’t mean much. Anyone who has followed burry long enough knows his view on the matter.
Yea but you know humans. They take things literally all the time anytime.
Musk sold 4.5 million shares so far, only 12.5 more to get to 10% of his 170 million shares.

Selling at the top is bullish.

Wen sell rest?
this friday... he will make a tweet with split post... thats when you sell.
Let’s go TSLA
Bull trap……… it’s just too much

Let’s see

Lol you must really hate money if your still holding TSLA....
If one more boomer analyst says the word metaverse im going to punch a wall
 I genuinely don't get all the positive comments about how Rivian looks. It reminds me of  something cheap Suzuki would make, and then keep in the Japanese market because it's too quirky for the rest of the world.

Tesla cybertruck doesn't do it for me either but BMW iX, Audi eTron and Jaguar iPace are all available now and much more appealing IMO. I suppose they're probably not big and boxy enough for the US buyer.
Maybe it’s because they start at $85k $65.9 and $69.9 lmao
Who cares what you like the general pop likes it
We should respect the people who wear glasses, they spend a lot of money just to see us
A thousand a year is what i spend
Last week I was the fucking man, went from 3k to 14 k this Monday, today I sit at 5k.... I am indeed not the fucking man

I’m done till next week
Pray for me
3k to 5k is 67% gain dude. Don’t sell yourself short
You went from 3k to 5k in a week stfu

I suppose the American thing is to pump and shout and root for 1999 or 2008 all over again?
I mean I bought a straddle so I’m not too worried but I’m also not closing that put this week
Ah yes the bears downvoting
Anyone else remember the debt ceiling crisis?! That’s what China just got out of. Expect the market to rally hard into end of Jan
> remember 

I remember like it was just today
I fucking hated those months
Welcome to heck, bud
We'll hit our debt ceiling in December though iirc. Not in terms of actual money, but they didn't extend the raise beyond December.
Yeah that’s priced in
I don’t think so, but I do think the market dip from that news will be temporary. Going to have some cash on hand end of month. Shit is so retarded but the retarded reaction is usually the best bet.
Spy always inverses logic so I don’t really expect too much of a dip if there’s any

So what TSLA is just not going to $1200? Fuck
Bounced off 1100 will see if she catches 1000$ if we break 1k then I expect to go down to next low of $980. I will be positioning my self long if we see 980$. I think support will be really strong at 1k and 1100 seems to be a sell wall of bear cocks
Tesla is overvalued, Buy Rivian instead.

Tesla has an insane Price to sales ratio. Idk, like 100 or so DYOR.

Rivian can't have a high multiple because they don't have any sales!
How about when everyone buys a Tesla?
TESLA heavy dump coming tomorrow.
Good point - time to buy calls
Yeah..down almost 20% off top wasnt enough for ghey ber?

I think Tesla puts is the way...
You’re prob right but let it get back above 1100 and buy before Elon unloads some more.
Elon probably dumps again at opening

So much selling pressure on Tesla. Sentiment has finally changed and momentum looks dead in its tracks.
Thank god. The world finally realised that Tesla isn’t a trillion dollar company
then banbet
So many sus floor bids.
I’m hoping TSLA shoots to 1200 for no apparent reason 🙏🏻
TSLA....Go Back To $1100 EOD.....
Bears coming out of hibernation
GME 1 year chart is the most bullish thing I've ever seen
Well yeah, if that's the ONLY thing you're ever looking at..I guess
Indeed, highway to tendie town
GME earnings are the most bearish thing I've ever seen

Out of business within 5 years
Clown take, 1000 by march

Is gamestop actually doing anything though?
SPY is going to shit its asshole out in sour hour
I bet it'll go up!! And then it will go down...and then up again...and down...and close where it opened.
There is a dude around here that keeps spreading lots of Covid scare shit and talk about needing boosters, including on other subreddits. 

Delve into his profile and what do you know ? He owns Pfizer stock and is also pushing that and talking about how they can raise prices. 

Piece of shit. Follow the money trail …
hey do you remember when 9 million bot accounts joined the sub to pump AMC and GME?
First of all they came in to tell you sell them and buy fucking silver.  And not even the metal some shitty mine
okay but seriously get your shots
Stop pushing that shit on WSB. It’s a gambling subreddit.
you brought it up mate
Oh you’re Australian. Explains it …
You had a 50/50 chance of guessing where I'm from and you done fucked it up, mate
K you’re from the other prison state.

You can downvote me as much as you want. I care less. One more thing, the rest of the world laughing at the dumb Americans and I can confirm , yes, the Americans are brainwashed and dumb. Enjoy you day. Do not forget your boosters.
We do need boosters - vaccines become heavily  ineffective after 6 months - and I don’t have any vaccine stocks.
Why is the fact that new cases are plummeting not being trumpeted?
Hahah they’re not they are on the rise again. Across Europe too… we stuck with this hoe.

Who’s buying Tesla puts ??
If inflation realization was actually the reason we sold off yesterday, it seems a little unreasonable to think we'd go above yesterday's high again until it's addressed or mitigated in some meaningful way...
  
Let alone the literal day after the news
That would assume the market is logical and we all know how that goes
My Spy calls giving me blue balls
guys tesla is very obviously a bull trap right? like so obvious? please tell me you all see that
Bro stock just rises month after month for past 5 years. What’s your point Dongus?
Bull trap ? Wtf are you smoking. Tsla is a continuous bear trap
Time for me to quit day trading TSLA.  What’s the play today?

TSLA $1200 by Friday?
I still believe elon is gonna sell more and tesla will hit 3 digits again.

Read the sec report. He sold the stocks before the twitter poll. Don't think he is on your side.
So you’re saying he’s on the shorts side…?
I'm saying he is gonna dump more while retail is boosting price up thinking sale is over.
Or he does a private transaction again off-market. Or slowly sells over the coming weeks.
link to sec report? One I saw was for sales on Monday. Let me see your source.

Yes
Next week Rivian market cap will be bigger than Tesla and Apple combined
CLOV is such bullshit; so beats revenue, has progress including the expansion into Georgia, CMS 3.5 stars, and an average cost above even the price target of most cunty anal cyst from BoFA and still less than a dollar off of its historical low?!! I’ll be damned if I sell a share at this ridiculous price; I’ll hold until my grandchildren get my shares.  Seriously less than a dollar off of its historical low; they can suck my dick
Why you're still holding this garbage long after the pump and dump is a great example as to why retailer traders tend to lose money
Oh I assure you you can't make money on CLOV puts either
Selling naked calls was easy money over the summer
Give me one reason it isn’t worth more than its current price; I bought in the 7s not the 28s.
It's worth whatever people will sell it for and that seems to be in the $7 range

Volume is nonexistant. It got pump and dumped months ago. The only people left holding are the ones too dumb to realize what happened and everyone else has moved on.
If there wasn’t any volume there wouldn’t be millions of shorts to keep the stock price low, like the dollar drop after beating estimates and guiding in-line.
You can believe whatever conspiracy theory you want while you watch that garbage trade flat and get crushed by inflation
When all you trade is old meme stocks from about 6 months ago… What the hell were you expecting ?
> The S&P 500 is up 8% year-to-date.
There’s people still holding from that pump, and that contributes to why the average cost is substantially higher than it currently is; this is not failing retail and has expansion of their MA market including the recent one in Georgia, all while the average age of Americans are increasing and their is an overhaul to Medicare.  Based off its historical low, it hasn’t even kept track with the S&P
RIVIAN MOOOONING 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
It’s okay TSLA hush now. You have my permission to die.
Robinhood is down lmao
No it’s not. Is your wifi turned on?
Theyre having login issues
Imagine still using robinhood
I am retard
If GME goes above 210$ things could get interesting. That daily chart is a beauty
If SPY doesn’t start bleeding out soon it’s going to make holding these puts overnight very stressful

1 week ATM SPY Calls look real good right now
I bought mine yesterday @464. Not feeling good about them, but who the fuck knows right now
I do charts and I think we have a short term bump in SPY. I'm a break even guy so who the F knows I agree.
I'm smelling 467-468 at a minimum, but I need that 470-472 area to make up for me being bullish too soon
What about 2 week OTM? I’m looking for some hopium
I'm better with shorter time periods.  I mean if you go OTM for 2 weeks and sell in a week that could work.  Not a bad strat.  I look at leading ETFs and XLK and XLF show a little life still.

Oil just making a small pullback before the climb up to $90 a barrel. We gonna blast you a new anus once the holidays roll in. 🛢📈🚂🚂🚂
Any thoughts on PSFE earnings? Seems like a good play for upward movement
It's been doing nothing since I bought it. Hope it pops up so I can sell my few shares & buy to close my CSP for .01.

Don’t y’all know bout November?! This month gonna heat up and run
BYND - down on a softening of demand, among other factors.  Is that because people tried it, didn't like it, and they are not going to buy it again
Well.. i have a gooood feeling about Rivian. Idk why but yeah
I have a good feeling it’ll go down
Hope you are right and it stays up until puts become available.
I want it to go up to like 200-300 in retard fashion and then open a 100k short position so I dont get IV Crushed
IV will be insane.  I'll prob spread it off or butterfly it.
That's why I said short, I meant short the stock, not buy puts
Canoo part 2?
I have a better feeling about it long term than short, we'll see a post IPO dip which may be a big dip depending on the staying power of this EV bubble

I like that they are focused on the truck/suv/commercial van segment which differentiates them a bit from TSLA, plus those segments are huge domestically.

It already dumped 17% lmao
Oh it's got more to go. IPO lockup is over starting today 10 million shares are now able to be sold
Keep in mind people that papa musky reportedly only sold a third of the block he intended. He pumping to dump again.
tsla +75 day
I don’t get shart sellers. Like who pays for your shart? Must be great salesman.
So what’s the word on BYND? Buy the dip?
Trash for real
Lowered guidance, a couple of their C suite has left recently, their moat's getting smaller. I'd wait a few weeks before buying.
NEIN
No.   I think we are finding out most people would rather eat beans and rice rather than beans and rice chemically manipulated to look like a burger or a chicken tender
I need a 100% overnight hold play baddddd
MRK $85-$90c 1/22 or further.

am i the only one not earning since 2020? i keep fucking hovering around breakeven
Down 165k.
> I am sorry to hear that.
Do you sleep?
Okay now tsla just spilt
BYND average price $212, do I average down?
That fad is quickly fading #wheresthebeef
wait for next earnings. i think $0 is a good buy in price
I think this will be $400 next year once everyone realizes fake meat is better
IT smells like dog shit and tastes like plastic. Puts on BYND
Start buying puts and get out!
I’ll sell a few puts and buy some calls?
Double down? Reevaluate your thesis then do that!
> I'm not going to reevaluate my thesis.
Averaging down only makes sense if you want out sooner. If you still like the company and plan to hold for a while use the capital elsewhere. If you no longer like the company then sell for a loss.
Seems like no one eats meat anymore. I don’t know one person who isn’t a vegan 🤷‍♂️
I like the company too, but their moat is getting smaller (lots of other good plant-based meats are getting popular) and they lowered their guidance. I would personally hold until the dust settles.
PSFE at -21%. Surely it's safe to buy now, right? Right?
Oh, wow. Now -28%
That's what they said yesterday
Any other Army vets turned degenerate gamblers in here?

What you think about 41c?
i’m holding one 41c from earlier in the week, don’t expect it to jump much above like 43-44 but you can still make some money off it imo
Will see how much the 40,41 and 42c are at open

Why is everyone all hung up on PLTR? I have only been trading for about a year so I’m no wizard. But, that stock seems lame compared to all the other opportunities out there. Just curious, why?
It was one of the first meme stocks on WSB and they can’t let it go. It listed around $10 and shot to $30 so people who got in the first day made bank but in reality it’s not worth anywhere near that so it’s just flatlining since then.
Gotcha! Thanks!
Because it's famous.
I don't own it nor have I ever considered owning it, but from what I can remember they have government contracts and do some shit with data analysis. it's probably at it's fair value at this point, but retards think anything they buy should always pump to 1000000s and now there's probably a ton of bagholders. I say all of this without looking at it so, grain of salt .
👊🏻someone needed to say it
So my children don’t have to work
Pltr calls???
It’s going back to 29 ez
Debating myself, as the zoom out looks nice. I saw Cathie has been going in (for better or worse), but they just got downgraded to underperform from the large growth % decline and people doubt they will hit their guidance as they capitalized off of new companies during Covid and feel that the best has passed for that avenue of revenue.
They are trying to shake out the bears and load up for the pump.
Buy Sophie at open
I hoping once people figure out what WISH had to do to barely MEET earnings they'll come to their senses. I guess first look it doesn't seem bad but its deeper than that.
So what to do with a TSLA  11/12 $1095c ? Paid $3,500 for it
Sell it, it expires Friday. Don’t risk it. Needs to shoot extremely higher than 1105 or Theta will rape you
Don’t get to greedy, target 1144
Can't say I'd be confident but your break even isn't far from where we're at. Id hope for a pop and try to get out with as little loss as possible.

fuckin ameripoors amrite!?
bro am i finally about to break even on this shitty SOFI stock???
if tesla splits again i’ll buy a share
Yeah I think I’ll buy a good amount of tesla if she splits again. It’s not bad to have for long term. Imagine In 2030 is going to be so much. It’s almost guaranteed.
Or it could be worth 1/5 in 2030 when there is lots of real competition. 

I’m not saying that is what will happen. But thinking TSLA is a guaranteed long term play is pretty naive. 


I think what will kill the stock is once it stabilizes and all the degenerates holding it get bored. They will want to move into something more exciting. So the price slips. Then more people jump ship. And it keeps going until eventually TSLA is priced appropriately

I guess I was more so saying the run up to 2030 will just keep going. And then allot long term holders will plan to sell around year 2030 and we see your 1/5th price action. Yes I can see it happening like this as well. Definitely though in 2030 or near tesla will be 2.5-10 trillion market cap. Speculation of course. With the announcement of full ai robotics driving, TSLA phone , robots for your house. Uber ai tesla cars. I think shit gonna get wild. They could even start offering giga factories.
So this is what the mind of a TSLA investor looks like.
Probably. If you look at my profile. I’m a gamerstonk investor. I was just speculating
come on lets get this shit moving i want a fat green day today

List the most overpriced stocks in the market I’ll start:

>NET

>SNOW

>DASH

>RIVN
Tsla
TSLA GOOG AAPL MSFT NFLX FB
Lol you’re lumping TSLA in with FAANG? Most of those companies have a P/E between 20-30 which is about the same as it was 10 years ago. Those stocks are actually cheap based on the growth rates they are putting up. For example, GOOG market cap is less than 2x TSLA but they have 5x more revenue.
Ok
AMD sell off incoming T-23 minutes

Eod dump incoming
Seriously though when is the last time SPY went down 5 days straight. Tomorrow has got to be an up day
Good news on ocugen covaxin vaccine. We'll see how that affects the price. Probably do an inverse again.
Why invest money into a company making a vaccine for a disease that has 3 different vaccines already
Buy low, hope to sell high. What other reason is there?

Edit: they don't even make the vaccine. Hahah.

I wish I believed that
Huge shout out the all the military service men/ women on this sub. With out you we wouldn’t be.
You forgot the last part of the sentence: "making big gains on our LMT calls".
Name the last war america fought in that was for something other then bankers wallets.
Agreed, but today isn’t about that.  The soldiers don’t choose where they fight.  Sure, they chose to join.  But we should be grateful they joined so that we weren’t compelled in to service.
Argh
Gross.

*careful they’re listening*
I first listened to Joe Rogan when he had Roxanne on the first time years ago. Stuck around for half a decade and chilled out. Listening again just to see where the podcast is at and Joe has completely sold out and drove off the cliff. Nothing is sacred. What a clown.
Dude Joe Rogan died last year.
RIP
Yup, it got really bad
Big JRE fan here, listened to pretty much every new episode for years. His most recent episodes are very hard to get through, hoping he can find his groove again
He's become a caricature of himself. He won't stop though because he's always getting new listeners via aging. Doesn't mean it's good.
The great thing about podcasts is that you can simply not listen to them if you don't like them
I loved JRE back in the day. Invested a lot of time as a listener and fan. These new episodes are borderline propaganda. Dude needs to check himself.
So don't listen?
RIVIAN $1T Market cap without selling a single car

If you focus on just the car aspect, they're worthless ... If you look beyond that and see their interchangeable chassis and logistics software. You see value.
When u lose hope in spy that’s when u know it’s time to buy more calls
Whenever you say buy more I do the opposite
Alright you’ll be buying calls overpriced af then
SPY is dead this week, my friend
Nah irrational pump from MMs to 467 so put buyers get cucked
I agree. But that’s still dead in my book. MMs are assholes and I wish this sub would unite and fuck them up again like they did with GME
Yeah thats when u buy before it jumps
Not jumping til after thanksgiving. Next week we’ll stay around 468-470 range
Spy inverses logic
Wsb inverses intelligence
That’s why I am buying spy calls while u aren’t
in that case it’ll be dead for the rest of the year.
TSLA has 18m volume compared to the 35m it had yesterday at this time, all I gotta say is you gonna see a big sell off 3pm and 3:45pm

Yes, yes I am vaccinated, let me into the fucking casino!!

Here comes the drop.
That’s it boys we need to bankrupt RH everyone buy puts, they’re screwing over the people again not letting anyone log in, I’m tired of this company’s BS
Ahhh the good ole cycle continues. Just another wave of purging users. There will always be more coming in not listening to the CONSTANT "leave robinhood" comments then getting mad the next time RH has a sustained outage. Its almost clockwork at this point every 2-3 months they will have a giant outage during volatile markets.

I also bought in again earlier this week. Long VALE
Second identical post of this I’ve seen. 

This particular account has lost nothing but “is this a thing?” In response to question comments as far back as I care to go back it’s history. 

Don’t fall for it. Sus as fuck.
Is this a thing?
I'm eyeing it. It is near the bottom of its 52 weeks low. I'll probably sell a poot and see.

Wtf happened to Disney lmaooo
Just giving us poor people a chance to buy some
PTON, DIS, BYND....TSLA
This lacks so many things to complete an idea.
Imagine holding Disney for over a year just to panic sell at the lows 😂 feel so bad for them
Ah , I see. It was a trap.
When is she due?
FB?
TSLA.  NVDA
Oh so you’re just dumb thinking TSLA was going to go to 1300 huh
Well considering I sold a bunch of calls at 1150… no.
No you didn’t haha
https://i.imgur.com/7VASvko.jpg
That’s a lot of buys and no sells. Lol fucking retard
They are credit spreads. There is one sell for each buy, just can’t see them in this screenshot. See the 44 contracts ? 

I want TSLA to stay below 1110 to make my money.

Also, if they were just calls, how do you think I’d be up so much ? It’s because the profit I took from selling the calls.
Ohhh see idk wtf a spread is so I was confused. Thought you meant you just sold calls meaning you had like 1000’s of shares of TSLA. Which is bs because some millionaire would not be arguing on WSB with an autist like myself
Hourly uptrend confirmed on Spy. We may be heading back up to new ath's  by tomorrow
Tsla bulls fuk
Wow tsla really going to $900 or lower wtf
you sound surprised
Anybody else getting dump vibes today? Or is that my bias talking as I hold VXX calls
Eat your fiber.
spy puts have made me so much more than spy calls, shits rigged
fun fact: you're statistically more likely to gain money on shorts and puts than on calls or longs. just random psychology and stuff.
Statistically the inverse of what I do prints
Statistically I get my clock cleaned with SPY puts.  With that said, these 470's I've been buying since the jobs report last week have been working, so far...
AMD just disappointing at this point
Tbh
Huh? Remember when it was at 73$ a few months ago after  the Xilinx crap...ppl these days
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Yeah it rips hard af around earning and then just sucks ass for 3 months
it was a bull trap F's in chat 🪤
Well, time to pump TSLA. Nothing makes sense anymore, so why not? 🚀
is something up with RH??? anyone having issues connecting
everyone apparently
Fakest gayest pump. Stay tuned for a righteous dump.
CRSR is now 34.43% shorted with 16.19 days to cover. Why aren’t we hopping on this!? It’s a good company and share price is undervalued. Also the stock is up 3.30% today. You tell me a good reason why it’s a bad idea, I’ll wait…
this sounds like every post any GME Ape would make.
supply chain ineptitude and past peak revenue, i.e. demand pull forward

but if you get enough apes, sure hop aboard long
I understand but that never stopped anyone when it was the same case for AMC. Shit, theaters were closed and ppl were buying shares
Action on GME?
It's not patriotic for stocks to be down on veterans day.
Bull flag forming, average down the calls
They want you to do that. We tank
ROOT gonna go crazy when shorts cover 🚀
And i almost sold it last week. Thank god.
i dumped my calls last night 😭 but got shares and calls at the dip today and i’m up nicely
I've heard this about so many different stocks
yeah but root has 48% SI second highest SI, and the volume is nuts rn already up 30% on the day the shorts can’t take too much more pressure
How does Nvidia grow into its current marketcap when their production is going to be bottlenecked by samsung and TSMC in the future? Sure metaverse is hot but their CAGR isn't going to be able to meet expectations unlike tesla which are building more factories to meet demands
Everything in this market is based off speculation.
There's speculation... then there's speculation based on nothing but hype
Thats just speculation with extra steps.
Like how the fuck do you become an analyst when you just slap on a price target. They should release their analysis for public to see just how dumb they are.
Because this market is being ran off fake funny money. Nothing matters anymore.
It does matter in the near term because a reality check is coming soon with taper. 6% inflation and 1.5% bond yields are whats propping markets up and it's going to soon disappear pretty quickly in 6 months.
That's the point. Nothing matters because in the end everything is gonna be fucked. Then it's just who is fucked more than the next guy? We'll see later.
Exactly. Imagine if TSMC gets annexed by China. NVDA is then worthless lol
Even if they don't get annexed... vivek arya's PT is based on 30% CAGR... getting frothy as fuck. How the fuck are you gonna get 30% CAGR when you can't ramp production and fighting other companies for wafers.

Even the prosecutor thinks Rittenhouse is innocent. Gtfo
Got in on that Tesla dip yesterday. 15 shares deep now.
I SPY a big green day
New aths today (in my opinion)
Don’t fall for the bull trap. DD for today.
AMC puts on the menu
Taco Bell on my menu today that’s forsure
Not a bad idea
Yum
Telling you right now that puts on Roblox is the way today. I made $4000 yesterday! Its a money printer for puts!
Ceo selling shares is bullish. Read the apes dd 🤡
I’m of the clan retard..apes and our kind doesn’t really mesh
Glad I made a bank from those Ponzi schemes 😉
I’m glad you did.
yet down in premarket. Elon sells his share and its launching. Yeah I got out of AMC. I had 100 41$c that jumped to $45. Sold all my options Sold 2000 shares. Right at 3:58 pm I bought 500p at 39strike.  Yeah... Amc made me rich before you all. AMC reminds me of the "Q" moment. All this DD but nothing happens. All bullshit
Imagine comparing amc to Tesla 😂
Yep one makes money the other sits and hodls waiting for that special day! In 9 month of holding AMC I lost so much money. In 3 weeks with Tesla, AMD, NVDA, IONQ, AMZN, and a few others I made 10 times the money I lost with AMC. Then got smart and sold my AMC right before the earning report. History repeats itself.  I learned from that. So while those fools are holding. I'm buying a Tesla and a New House with plenty of cash left over. Last earning call for AMC the stock dropped like a rock with a rocket pointing down tied to it. Not this time! Nope!
Drs won't save AMC, likely won't save GME either but at least that has a chance.
Yall dumb. It's a normal start the day sell. We won't hit red on large caps.
Bought a little Disney.
Gonna buy a little more Disney later.
Lol WISH trash earnings… spikes 12% 🤣🤣 
This is funny 😆
Imagine investing for fucking dividends. Just facepalm 🤦‍♂️
Imagine having 8 digit port and living just off the dividents. Imagine enjoying life Instead of starring at the candles all day 🤦🏻‍♂️
Imagine having so much money, dividends make up a year's wages. Now you know
why don’t you just buy bonds or get a savings account then? Dividends expose you to the risk of the market whilst not rewarding you (dividend stocks don’t facerip)
There is a real estate company that grew 40% since last year. 70k invested would give you $560 a month.
what’s the name of it? I’m interested now. 

for the sake of the subreddit,l entertainment purposes, I’ll also include a usual autistic response by saying that $70k invested for 500p/m is peanuts
It's a Canadian commercial real estate company called riocan. Ticker rei-un.to. SPG was also nice to get last year
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Donny’s market - limp dicked annualized <15%

Sleepy Joe’s market - rock hard 40% annualized and growing
I think failing to account for the largest governmentally mandated economic shutdown and reopening in modern history might make this statistic somewhat biased.
Nope, president controls the stock market.  That’s why the president traditionally autographs DJIA charts.

Is SPY back on its bullish trend or is she going to bend me over next week?
Bullish trend
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
It looks good right now.  If she doesn't turn today, she will continue to drop through tomorrow and turn early next week.
Middle of each month SPY dips pretty significantly. Usually like the 18th.
If inflation does go to like 15% and the fed has to raise rates to like 3-5% how will the USA pay interest on its debt?
The Feds will call Dave Ramsey for a solution on that debt.
We're gonna need bigger envelopes
We won’t. Which is why the fed never will. They’ll just tell everyone to suck it up and accept a “little” inflation
Inflation is great for debt holders. We pretend to care about inflation because it hurts the wealthy with large bank accounts.

Small peen vs large peen pros and cons:
Large shmeat pros - you feel cool, you can really swing it around, can do poem when you lose all your money from yolo plays 
Cons - dips in the toilet when you poop, most girls can’t handle it, limits pants you can wear unless you want to show odd the bulge, bigger target for attackers who can just bop you in the crotch and you’re done. 

Small shmeat - reverse of all of those. Additional con is that you will be self conscious even though 90% of women won’t care about the size.
Pros. Your mom likes both.
Cons. Your mom like both.
Only the Greeks liked small peens but they were degenerates.
MetaHero anyone?

Playing paysafe before earning is not safe after all. My portfolio is fuckkkkkkkkked
Holy fk an estimated 10.7 million TOST shares available to sell today, the insiders who own those shares bought in pre IPO for $40 or less so roughly $90 million in profit taking expected at open. Their earnings ain't shit when the share float is about to increase by that just today, tomorrow itll increase by another 65 million shares sooooo $640 million in profit taking oooooweeeeee poots gonna print

u plan on buying 0dte is what im hearing?
Maybe eod today. Keeps bleeding though so we'll see if it keeps around 3500 imma buy
seems logistic
Do you think it's worth picking up paysafe leaps with a 5 dollar strike? I'd so why?
Just looked it up, holy hell. 

Well, the word "safe" is in the name so should be fine, maybe.

Is jpow or Biden talking today? This low volume is ominous and🌈
I know this sub hates WISH but look- ceo is out which is good. No Q4 guidance means they’re not expecting much and look at the stock today. Bottom is in. Could go to $10 on good news easily

NEGG is freaking so close to making me rich, she’s fully naked and tied me to the bed, but just keeps blowing air on me all around and won’t touch me. Idk it’s pretty cool but like it tickles so it make me uncomfortable
She gets around, because I'm strapped to the next bed over :)
Makes YOU uncomfortable, I just read this n threw up a lil, you know that back of throat thing.
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a land slide, no escape from the metaverse. Open your eyes, look up at fake skies and REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Did I leave my cheeks wide open picking up Spy puts?
My calls on SPY are getting rammed as well. Theta winning the day
Damn I bought PSFE at $4.40 looking to play the dead cat bounce… now I feel like the bag has gotten heavy already.
Slow market day with the vix hanging in there is a little ominous

Better than dropping 8%

Daily reminder to fomo into whatever is popular at the moment

This new season of Narcos is garbage. They really tried to woke a show about drug traffickers. Ruined the show. Puts on NFLX
Funny thing is woke people are poor so where do these companies think revenue is going to come from catering to them?
What the fuking fuk shit are you doing TSLA????
Dan Harmon: "I've been working on this idea for a show lately where it jumps the shark in the first episode and then it just keeps turning into a more and more ridiculous caricature of itself. But while it's doing that, the character arcs and the overarching mystery of the plot are all centrally connected to a meta narrative about the story getting more and more ridiculous. It's a show about people in a cartoonish world coping with the accelerating levels of cartoonish bullshit they have to put up with as they're increasingly torn between the world of their creators producing the show and that of their audience consuming it. In theory, such a show could never die." 

Justin Roiland: "Dude, sick. I do silly drawings and funny voices, we should team up."

Dan Harmon: "... funny voices, you say? Like what?"
Druuuuuuuuuuuuuuggggssssss
Market wildly rejected Lucid at this same valuation months ago.  No material change has happened in their business, just shipped a car.  Which should be priced in to a $70B company.

It’s just gone up because Tesla did and the bubble has inflated
And rivian is fairly valued
Ok and?
And it means you are trading on sentiment and not fundamentals.  Works until it doesn’t
If you traded on fundamentals the last 3 years you'd be broke
Price targets raised to $60 today too
FIGS V shape recovery
Shorted 100 shares of amd ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
You fucked up fam
At the bottom right?
Nah, today
I mean, at 140
Nope shorted today.
145.5
Very smart. It won't sustain these levels. Just like after last earnings. Just look at the damn RSI. Pullback within the next month.

Only risk is if NVDA kills earnings and AMD trades in sympathy and goes up more next week. The pullback will still happen, but be delayed a bit and it might not dip as far to find  support, so your upside might be limited.
All the large caps are kicking ass this earnings season..I think its time for meme stonks to rule the wall street.
President Manchin says there will be no BBB bill in the near future. Lol
That guy is from West Virginia. I don’t even need to say any bad words to make fun of him, just facts.

elon smash that sell button bro
Any you guys know when Rivian options become available?
> They're not.
Isn't it usually two weeks after IPO?
3 days from going public I think
They need to be put in check and brought back down to earth
I can’t why to buy puts. They’re going to be expensive
Think options are a week after stocks but could be wrong
Bond market is closed today. I bet we dump again tomorrow
I need a powerful hour please

/u/syndromedown-hopesup (1/0) made a bet that NVDA would go to 305.0 when it was 298.49 and it did, congrats gigabrain.
An ETF that inverses Cathie Wood? I need one of them shits for me.

And if your assumption of red tomorrow isn’t a ban bet, I don’t wanna hear it
I already some mine, will get in next week
Wish I would have bought rivian at 100 yesterday 😢
I bought at $112 and boy do I feel like I’m will be holding a heavy bag
BLZE...BLZE...BLZE!!!
Imagine being normal and liking full form women with some curves and being gaslight throughout the whole 90s and 2000s. "Bro! Her ass isn't completely flat! What are you, a chubby chaser?" "Bro, you can't even see her ribs and spine! She's really let herself go"

God, thank you for this new Golden Age of Ass
orca whale fucker right here 🐳
nooooo it's just like the 90's all over agian ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
NEGG, it's okay, you can take your time :)  


  


^(I swear to god once we get home I'm going to beat the shit out of you. Stop making me look bad in front of my friends, you lazy piece of shit, get up there. I made a ban bet and you better not make me lose it or I swear to god...)
NVDA I’ll wait right here for you baby. You rocket when you’re ready
SPY price too high IMO
People who truly believe in the saying "live within your means" have been complicit to staying poor widdle bitches for the rest of their lives.
Yes, I plan to live way in my means, and still spend like crazy. That saying isn't about living like a poor, it's about expanding your means when you don't need to.
Please be a power hour.
Can we get a good fucking power hour today>?
No.
pain tomorrow > pain today
pain forever
If NEGG investors had a fun nickname what would it be
I've had one in mind all day but I do not want to say it
Nice try😂😂
Every job interview should ask "have you ever invested in WISH or SOFI?" and if they answer yes they are instantly eliminated from contention, unless the job is at Wendy's, then it's a requirement.
Can we change the time for the power hour. It really screws up the end of my day.
Is rivian a good play?
I would short if there were shares yet
That’s a keeper in my book.
Bonds selling off , Tech Stocks selling off , Rich people putting their money in commodities , silver/gold/steel/etc.
Cathie needs to do more KO and start buying more TSLA
The manager said he wouldn't call the cops, if I stop bothering the customers
I mean, when has that stopped you before?
Every time I roll up, my cat takes a dump lol
pavlov bro

pavlov
This motherfucker and his cat have some issues to work through
Just shit and roll do it together
Does anyone actually believe in RIVN or is everyone just trading it because sentiment?

Most everyone seems to just think it’s going to go up but is stupid valuation
My RIVN 525 of them just got sold as it triggered at 6% Trailing stop.
That 1200c is looking juicy for tsla
Looking like free money. For whoever sells it.
Let's go, pump all my stocks and crash the rest of them.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
Dow index is full of shitty boomer stocks. Let's add AMD, NVDA, TSLA, Facebook, Amazon, Google and Sofi to Dow.
Apple is genuinely a Boomer stock pretending to be tech company.
Boomers love the same old thing rehashed. Clinging to the past is all they have.
Sourest power hour on record
There have been worse but yeah, pretty stinky out there
Really not sure what Friday or next week will bring. I could see some drilling but still in calls 😜
STOP THE COUNT
I thought after yesterday's sell-off the market retardation would settle down. Nope it bounced right back. CPI confirmed inflation is very bad and no one cares or thinks rates will go up because of jpow's track record of market first
Well ladies and retards, TSLA got a pump of volume. Perhaps an aftermarket selloff?
HERE WE GO WITH THE END OF DAY DRILLING
Bulltrap today
Yea miss the rally you bear turd
idm missing rally just looking at rivian lol ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
If someone wants to make easy 100% than buy Tesla puts!
I don't think anyone is going to take your advice with a name like that.
i'll invert his advice, or I would if i could afford TSLA call premiums
call debit spreads my dude, couple hundred bucks
Limited upside, don't know why you crazies keep pushing debit spreads on high moving stocks.
oh I stay the fuck away from TSLA options, I was just saying it's not $1.5k+ to get into them 


the limited downside is worth it on other tickers. spreads are chill
Not worth it at this point. 1045 rose like $80 with a $8 dip. Fuvk that headache.
Logic of spy dump tomorrow when spy has held gains/been green all day? (Price consolidation)
I think the this week red is the consolidation for a new ath next week
Fridays are generally when new ATH occur
Next friday

Go ahead
Watch out for the $10 increase tomorrow, this guy *knows* it's happening.
Possible. Dems/fed could buy before build back better
It's not possible. But you already knew that.

You just spam the same shit over and over to make yourself feel better.
Look who’s talking
Someone has to call you out on your bullshit.
So does someone for you
I once again ask you to put your money where your mouth is.

Institute a ban bet. You're so confident spy will be close above 475 tomorrow. You've been saying it all week, so bet. You think your little lines mean something, so go ahead and bet. 

Hell, if spy closes above 475 tomorrow I'll take a self imposed permanent ban.
?
I’d be bearish if spy was at yesterdays low by now, but not the case

WISH holders are crazy. Like the CEO just quit and the company said Q4 will be shit.
The CEO quitting is probably the best thing for this stock IMO…also I thought they didn’t issue guidance?
cant go down much more
TSLA green by EOD. And bigly
maybe tmmr
Hahahahahahahahahahaha very sad
WISH is mooning boys. Strap tf in.
Makes no sense either. Weren’t wish earnings dog shit

Why would Thomas the train do such a thing like that ☹️
Bro they buried that one train alive, Thomas and friends are stone cold killers.
That’s actually a prerequisite.
As long as you can watch the next one
Does she still have legs?
Would running a train on the bride be part of my wedding?
Depends.. is she a dime?
Is this a euphemism for something that I don't understand?

LUMINAR LETS MAKE IT HAPPEN, BACK TO 30 COME ON 

FUKING DOG about to short skuweeeez
WISH soaring at open from $4.88 now toward $6. Why? Even SDC is finally dropping.

What the heck is wrong with you guys? There's no squeeze, the company is shit, the ceo himself came out and threw his own product under the bus.

This is crazy. I feel bad for the put holders, they were teased ah yesterday.

It's quite something. Some people just make themselves believe failed zombie companies are successes. Surely some sort of mental decline in progress 

Where were these guys at before SEARS ended up at the OTC?

I’m long on DKNG I think next year it can see a tasty run up
chances Tesla hits 1125 by tomorrow?

Opened 1100 and sold off like a bish. Elon sold off 5B over 2 days. Assuming he started Monday, and he keeps the same pace, he prob won't finish til middle of next week, for a total of 8 trading days.
So.... I'm fucked is what you're saying.
Lmao.. i guess. But the good thing is that we know roughly when he'll stop putting downward pressure on the price.
God damnit. That guy pumping Pfi-zer for that past year must be rich. Oh wait, that was me.
I put chilli powder on her panty, now she's mad.
An Elon tweet would be nice right about now
Should i sell another 10% vote yes or no, strictly follow votes
He’s gonna tweet “no split in the next year” and kill us all
GREEN IS FUCK
Here comes the rip bottom is in
That was the dip. We would be dumping like a mfer right now if it wasn’t

Infa bill won’t be passed with inflation this high. Ask munchkin
Dems run the house/senste. If that wasn’t the case, we would have defaulted on our debt in oct.
Elon Musk himself is dumping on the  delusabull bag holders. Never thought I’d see the day 😂😂😂
Should I buy sofi puts? Got $19,000
Rip here comes the spy dump
Let’s go Tesla

Spy go to $466 pussy you won’t
HOW CAN YOU NOT BUY CALLS ON PSFE AT THIS PRICE ??????
It's gonna melt up EOD. True value play
Down 40 something % percent in a day. Easily will get a decent bounce

Nice little pump
Fuck it, vertical trading
Perpendicular vertical trading. Fuck it
Tik tok... $PENN
Will this be a buy the rumor, sell the news....
Very fair question... I'm betting on Portnoy. CEO of Barstool came out and she backed Dave an hour ago... I think she likes the goods.
I bought the Portnoy dip and Im still down we need it to moon more!
Where is penn?
Small position only up $4500 and rising.
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Jumpdeckchair (1/2) made a bet that SPY would go to inf when it was 464.96 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

He’s not wrong, just early.
over through the shorts! $ROOT
If you’re buying more AMD over XLNX here you’re fucking retarded
Well that's all the DD we need folks.
Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Lol at this guy schillin
Nah you’re just retarded
i cant trade anymore fuck PDT and fuck poor people
Cash account
So fuck yourself then?  Got it.
DIS 165c 11/12 Free money!
Puts on LCID. It’s time. I think that earning report on Monday will dump it too.
I feel that. Wouldn't be quick to bet against them though.
Wth why is that company worth 70b???  😳
It ain’t. And it’s all speculative, they don’t really have any sales yet. Earnings report 11/15
I want to buy some puts bc it only makes sense but in this dumbass market I could see them selling 20 cars instead of 15 (for example) and the market being retarded and thinking wow they exceeded expectations and should be worth way more than 70b!
Yep it’s a risk. But it seems like almost everything dumps after earnings report, regardless if it’s good or bad
I love you AMD
I love u NVDA
PSFE going to get a dead cat bounce tomorrow, right? How are $4 FD calls for tomorrow not free money at 0.33 per?
As far as FDs go, it's a good gamble imo

#BULL GANG LETS CHARGE UP THAT HILL AND KIL DEES DAM BERS!!!!!!!!!!!!
And that Hills Name? >!Hamburger Hill >:)!<
dear rivian,

please do some retarded shit for power hour.

kindly,

me.
SPY go up goddamn
spy +1.2% eod
Hmm
NVDA reverse gamma due to degen option buying
What? so it'll crash?
You tell me. I'm just throwing random predictions around.
No way TSLA runs up more… right? 😫
I think people think Elon finished selling or think Elon selling doesn't affect the stock price. So back to going to the moon!
Tsla not going to the moon anytime soon. Elon still has a lot left to sell. There's gonna be more big dips, I mean what do you think caused the dip this week?
elon start the selling proccess in September before the twitter poll. i think he is done now.
Praying to a god who doesn’t exist for a hard dip at open so I don’t take a loss on these puts.
How's that working for you?
About the same as it always does, starts with prayers ends with tears
Imma pay more in taxes than my total profit for the year bc I can’t stop yoloing 🤡🤡🤡
? Not sure that’s how it works unless you’re counting your daily job income also
You're not the only one lol
retards say TSLA dropped because elon sold and not everyone panic selling. he's only sold 1/3 of what he's going to. today is not a win if this is the case.
He also bought 2 million stock for 6 dollars a piece FYI 😂
How is $5 bill 1/3 when he said he was selling $10bill?
where do you find he sold 5 billion
All over the news?
You stupid degens just don’t get it.
I love how the fanboys just know it’ll go back up once Elon stops selling
>Give me a one-handed Economist. All my economists say 'on hand...', then 'but on the other...

-Harry Truman

All these macroeconomist geniuses keep telling us Fed is pumping trillions into the economy has zero impact on demand.  Biden $1.2T stimulus, just transitory supply chain stuff move along.

Businesses are facing WAY higher expenses and input costs than the 6.2% that we see.  They just can't actually pass it all to people at once.  This is definitely just the beginning.
So what’s the long term play then?  Just all in on indexes?
> This is definitely just the beginning

So you're saying SPY 800 by the end of next year?
Forget S&P 5000, it'll be SPY 5000
While super risky, a massive melt-up is definitely possible before mid next year.  Personally I prefer to play it with calls or options generally.
New froggy fresh song is dope AF.

I knew the hedgies r behind these fake futes pump

Up to u bulls to take it or leave it
Buy the close, sell the open pumpers.
Bulls get out ur Calls at the best price at open
SPY gonna rip all day I feel like
How about no
Happy watching them expire worthless or baghold them
Is this another bull trap?
Who know.
And there spy goes, straight down into the abyss
Back to NVDA calls it is
You know what? Ima say it, fuck the mouse!
Squeezing $WISH on 11/11
SELL OFF HOLY FUCK
Drill team 6 incoming
Tesla to 400?? I would make so much in puts then use all that money to buy it’s stock and delete my app for 30 years
> I would make so much in puts then buy it’s stock and delete my app for 30 years
Pump is fake. Pump is gay. Elon selling every day. Down we go. Way down far. Buying puts? You know we are!
GME one year chart is so beautiful :)
They try so hard to have GME and AMC mirror eachother.

Nobody is falling for it, only 1 of em has "Idiosyncratic risk" to the entire system.

Bears are so screwed today. Just give up already!
You did it, you made them give up. Amazing.
No one on this sub thought SPY would hit $470 after being rock bottom at $427

Therefore inversing everyone and buying more 500C
🤡
Calls on wsb reading comprehension soon, we have to be near bottoming out
NVDA fucks
Damn the US spent the last 20 years blowing up and rebuilding the Middle East while letting our own infrastructure crumble and it’s almost like we are facing the consequences of the military industrial complex

Ok this shit's kinda sus ngl. Close the casino!
Hit me downvote fairies. I'm not scared of your bear shit.
HOLD OUR GROUND BULLS
TSLA, do $1300
I’m sorry. I don’t know that one.
Ok, playing “Do you really want to hurt me “ by Boy George.
The fact that spy and nasdaq are blood green and tsla is barely green tells me a small red day will wipe tsla the fuck out
short term memory loss of yesterday or? 


no horse in this race but lol we just tested that 24hrs ago
That shit was wild. I told tsla will drill down so hard.
Tesla puts are printing ... wish i could buy more

🤡 market
Bond market is closed today. That is why we are mooning.
Taper coming sooner than expected is you chugging CNBC juice.

Fed hasn't said shit.
Market will continue mooning if Jerome will be renominated. Still too early to go bear mode 🌝
Fund managers know this.

Anyone saying otherwise hates money.

EoY rally here we come.
ROOT going to squeeze. Heavily shorted stock!!!
So spy has a sizable dip and then the market has VERY low volume the next day buying up that dip and y’all are bullish? Damn some of y’all are actually retards
Spy ath tomorrow we don’t make the rules here bro
1dte bullish
I mean, the dip isn't being bought. SPY is basically flat today. Likely most traders are on holiday and won't be back till tomorrow. 

November and December are traditionally seen as bullish months because of performance metrics that need to be met. Given the retracement we saw in September, it's unlikely this is the start of a major retracement, as these types of large scale market pullbacks are usually spaced 6 to 8 months apart.
We will see a flash crash at about 1255pm
Can we force a banbet?
eastern time or pacific time?
Both!!! 2x
Elon selling premarket now?
shit is looking too green. this is sus af

I don't get ELY...2 quarters of great earnings and trading 20% lower than it was 5 months ago.
Look into it and lemme know. Been watching it for a year almost.
Double down on tsla puts, I love Elon but he sold only 1% so far out of the 10, everyone assuming he sold 10% already
Think its close to 2-2.5% but yes
Yep lots of room to go down still
Wrong. He sold 20% of the Twitter poll, or 2% of his share holdings, or 0.45% of TSLA.

U can buy dips but not now

Cuz the real dip comes don’t complain u got no cash
Tsla won’t go below 1k all the broke fanboys will buy just to save their daddy
musk dont care ..would be best for him.. he´s dumping fanboys going to hold his bag xD
Spy almost low of day here comes sweep under 464
Sold 20 CSPs of $WISH 5 1/21/21 a month ago for $1.01 each for about $2000 total, just bought to close for $0.61 while $WISH spiked this morning for no reason.

It's only about $800 profit, but we have to enjoy our small victories -- and it's more than most of you retards made on $WISH.

https://ibb.co/dBqtBwt

Sure
Lol. There you go again with your dumb ass confirmation bias chart. Trying to plot from the beginning of the pandemic to now and use that to extrapolate the price next month is literally the dumbest thing I've ever seen on here.
Lmao there still is no tapering/increase in interest rates/no tariffs and soon to be another stimmy 🤡
Market drop tomorrow 😵‍💫
Get that fear mongering horse manure out of here
Guys, if you don’t buy Tesla puts, you are really dump, the downtrend ist there and room to go till easy 800/900
what dates did you buy
15/dec  and 17/march
I'm 100% Cash Gang

Why go cash if you think the market is going up
Don't hold your breath
Let's go Rivian(RIVN)! Let's go! Take us to the moon!🚀🚀🚀 Tesla needs a worthy competitor! 🚘💸💸💸
Those invested, hold the line!
**DEC calls on DISNEY are printing since this morning**
my nov calls i bought at the bottom as well
Paysafe dont look so safe
Is it still SPY $470 EOW!!?!!!
Does Pope Frankie touch little boys?
Does Theta fuck bitches?
What are your thoughts on shorting LCID for earnings next week? The valuation feels ridiculous and what good news could they possibly have?
They wouldn’t be the only EV company with a ridiculous valuation
Bulls call this day a win.
I'd prefer the term dead cat bounce in my case, but sure
Theta calls it Thursday.
It is tho
Dump at open just like I told the idiot bulls, at least I can eat today.
About to eat shit
Dump at open usually means incoming pump, so best of luck to you bruh✌🏻
Come on Tesla get to 1200
Alexa Grace
Y’all missing out on Rivian just like you missed out on Tesla get fucked bears 🐻
There are no options to trade on Rivian yet.  You plebs can trade actual shares if you like, I don't wish to dirty my fingers
Enjoy buying the puts I’ll be selling
The fact that the American experiment has failed is proof that none of us deserve nice things
British monarchy functions pretty well. Put all the executive power in the hands on one family and keep reminding them they’ll be executed if they ever use it - Charles I style.
I think we should have a council of smart people. And I agree with monarchy. 

The fact that AOC is deciding what happens is proof enough we need kings
That's what Jan 6 white lives matter was all about
The new 9/11... Where were you on Jan 6th?

Honestly tell me what you were doing Jan 6th....So traumatic
Good night bulls. Try again tomorrow.
Puts are down but you're happy?

Is this what being a bear looks like now?
I like men
shout it louder sister!
I like men!
If I’m being honest, I can’t stand that SPY never actually dumps. Bulls are so fucking dumb and gay . Look around you, read the room and let it crash already
Suk a gynecomastia titty
Take your own advice and read the room.
Good one pal
>Bulls are so fucking dumb

>read the room 

Zoom out
hey, don't worry, you'll have a few days of red throughout the next year
I know right
Where were you the entire month of September
One month of dips verse how many years of wild undeserving gain?
> A month of dips is equivalent to about nine years worth of wild undeserving gain.
For SPY to really, REALLY dump, the individual stocks of 2-300 companies would have to be getting dumped simultaneously.  Sector rotation isn't going to dump SPY.  Rotation from growth to value isn't going to dump SPY.  Honestly if you want to make bear plays you'll have better luck with QQQ.  Rotation from growth and tech dumps QQQ way harder than SPY, because that's money leaving NASDAQ stocks.
SPY has got me fucked up.

I thought yesterday and the day before were theta days against selling pressure, but futes mooned so hard now I feel like it was just yesterday being a theta day against buying pressure. 

I think today is just another theta day against selling pressure, but it feels so foggy and unclear against the conflicting possibility. I hate how the market overlords are so good at using this opposite day type shit to fuck with my head and paralyze my market sense to make me trade like shit.
You're overthinking it man
Nah, just have to see if I can get through today (and tomorrow?...?) without my portfolio ending up in a dumbass shitty position. Gonna take lots of thought
Holy shit you're retarded, sometimes SPY goes down. We're going into Christmas season soon, it'll go back up. Stop overthinking a couple of bad days
Imagine being so retarded you can't think of a better word than "retarded" to use in the context of insulting someone for being too smart
HAHAHA YOU ACTUALLY THINK YOU SAID SOMETHING INTELLIGENT HAHAHAHA
So which is it? Did I overthink or underthink? Make up your retarded little mind
When did I say you were under thinking? Not surprised your dumbass can't read haha
sdc squeezes today
Nope
I sold so I hope you are wrong
Ouch $PSFE
I really do buy some dumb shit, but that's what will get me rich someday. Oh and sprinkle in some "hard work"
Thank God palantir and Canoo stopped dipping.

Good buy in price
pltr never stops
Tesla up on reports Elon did his stock sale, but he’s not finished selling?
He only sold a small portion.
You lr bugging he sold 10% already
He’s not finished yet. It will be in increments
Yes he is
your whole profile is literally shilling
Today will be the day all people who “knew” the market was going to drop will laugh at those who are losing money. Or vice versa. As usual.

Get out of here with your commie nonsense. Down here in America we work on Veterans Day! Unlike you lazy igloo living monsters.
There's no fence on the north side (yet)
How I have one stock mooning (SOFI) and one stock cratering (PSFE) at the same dam time? Smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
If you have calls on both you will probably still come out ahead.  No biggie.
Imagine having PROG and BYND
Green today and maybe even tomorrow (probably not) but we'll probably see another drop soon. Gamble carefully.
Next week possibly
If green today and tomorrow then next week bleeding
Any reason behind that?
Nope just guessing
Holy shit SOFI only does $230M rev in a quarter? That valuation is retarded
It’s a new company I think

Just dump you cunt.
GME is a pretty tempting short if you short long term. Need to check the interest cost though.
bro you trying to make people lose money with that
let tsla bleed out til EOD then we load up
I’ll load up around 700
Ok, good plan.
I put $500 into 1dte SNDL .50p lmao

Fuck that company. 

Probably won’t print though
Bro weed is priming for a pump you’re dumb
I specifically hate SNDL and I don’t really care if this goes tits up lol
You’re expecting a 30% down move in a day? Get help
It’s a lotto ticket you fucking moron, it’s for fun. 

I’m not “expecting” shit lol.

And yes, a -30% move in a day isn’t unreasonable on a garbage company like SNDL lol.
Giving away $500 is fun! Truly autistic stock hasn’t been near .5 in 10 months
🤷‍♂️ might print, company’s financials and management are horrible and earnings is after hours. 

Don’t care about the $500. It’s $500. It’s gambling. Where do you think you are right now?
There’s a difference between gambling and throwing away money. You’re doing the latter
My guy, the company is valued at 1.5bn and makes 9m/year in revenue. 

It tanking 30% is absolutely a believable scenario. Out of every weed stock on the market SNDL is the outstanding piece of absolute trash. For .01 a contract yes it worth it to buy these puts.
Watch him make a bag after earnings lul
TSLA pump already plz

Idc if i lose money on my tsla puts, as long as the tsla bulls are losing too
This is a very dumb way to look at the market
it's a dumb, and incredibly unhealthy way, to live life in general

Today bulls are going to make so much money.
Despite making up only 7% of the population, veterans commit 8% of the crimes. Curious 🤔

^(This isn't purely a shitpost, I Googled it and veterans do make up 7% of the US adult population but 8% of the incarcerated population apparently)
They deal with mental disorders after being discharged and they're not taken care of by the va. It makes sense
Sign of a government not taking care of its people, perhaps
Totally the problem
Your saying people fighting in meaningless wars and  are kiling other people and are put in life and death situation have difficulty adjusting to society when they come back🤯
Now do the other one
Who makes up the majority of criminals?
Probably wsb users
8% incarcerated does not equal 8% of crimes.
I know, same with the other statistic's supposed reasoning.

The reality is homeless veterans interact with police so much more than financially stable veterans that the police bias against homeless people seems to slightly more than cancel out the police bias in favor of veterans.
Despite humans making up 100% of the population, they commit 100% of the crimes.
What about bears?
If you want downvotes, this is how you get them.
Lol if I wanted downvotes I could do far better. Watch this:

#Hey whoever's reading this, I bet I'm smarter and funnier than you and if you downvoted my joke it's cause you were too retarded to get it. Travis Scott was an inside job by the deep state studying mob mentality in the same vein as MK Ultra. Theta gang controls all prices and they can make it look like there's buying pressure when there's actually selling pressure overall in they market because they can't just let options traders win
Smells like a shit post to me. Do you know any Vets any Active members ?. Have you said that standing in front of them.? 
Our service members do so much for so less...its not only the governments fault it is people that think what they do does not help all of us. And what side of the line do you stand?? 
God bless our Military 
Thank you that is all.
My dude Hippie Moses was a combat veteran but didn't really identify as one, not sure if that counts
I hope you bulls die today.

Lol, psfe halted on dump
Lmfaoo i had a leap for it in case the company just rocketed cuz it was cheap af 😂. Its moving like a penny stock
I'm trying to time the bottom here and get more, huge overreaction here. Algos going crazy.

SPY will stay between $465-$477. Options killer.

I’m going to play SoFi options early and then sell around 11. Just trying to find a good strike
Oh i understand, did you buy puts?  calls? Alot of people are playing SoFi should be good.
I’m going to play SoFi.

I have SPY calls but not for this week.
See what I mean?
Yup hahaha. Market went from green to stagnant. Still young, who knows.
These fuckers are slick. They probably read this subreddit too. Greedy ass pigs.
FR. Time in the market, beats timing the market! To Valhalla my friend
Sell my sofi 11/12 23 calls at open for that IV or hold until tomorrow?
Sell
Depends on your upside for a potential 10-20% gain vs IV spike 

If you would gain 2k by it going to 25-27, but gain more than that in the IV spike, then sell the IV spike. If not then ride it out
If they were mine I'd sell right at open to protect against a fade during the day, but you do you boo boo.
Take the money and buy a longer dated call at a higher strike with some of the money so you can still gain if it continues to run
I’m selling at open
Making money at open is always nice.
ROOT priming to come back down…smh

Salty you bulls.
My TSLA plays are 1) sell 10-15% OTM puts that net premiums at 3-4% max loss. 2) Roll out when puts reach 75% of max gain. 3) Buy TSLA stocks with the gains. Repeat.

Sell NVDA for a loss in case it dumps?
If you're bullish, no. If you're bearish, yes. I'm bearish on this market weakness (not to be confused with a bear. I trade both ways)
I’m long on NVDA. Iv is through the roof. Contracts are not cheap. We need a nice dump honestly. But I think we trade sideway up to earnings. If they report well I think we retest 320 and break seeing high of 380 maybe 400$ end of year. If not we will dump back down to previous lows.
I rolled out my 11/19 calls I had for 300$ sold at 320. Then waited tell yesterday to buy 320 calls expiring Jan 2022. Pretty much took all my profit to buy one. They are not cheap. And not really a good sign to buy when Iv is so high. But I guess you got to pay to play. I’m currently down on this Jan 2022 calls 25%
No bagholders had any good losers for me today so I bet on some shitty luxury travel company I've always missed out on before. Like every time I've wanted to buy calls they would have printed but I said *nah the company is too shit*. Not this time
I’m not tryna hate but honestly PLTR looks like a bear pennant about to drop below support

We talking about the industry of goods of sporting
We are
Give me a hint
It’s up 60% over the last month, that ship has probably sailed unless you’re just looking to collect the dividend
It hasn't sailed. I'm not going to be the idiot that says "it's jUst geTtiNg StArteD" but we have good potential for the 60s at least.
Thinking it's to late to hop in though
if someone sets like a 2000 option sell order at an inflated price does that artificially inflate the option price? my leaps are going up on down days and down on up days and i notice the bid ask is kind of wild regarding the sell orders being super inflated on the down days and back down on the up days
Yeah most brokers base it off the mid price between bid and ask.  So it looks like its worth more but you'll never be able to sell them for that
Yesterday was cool, but, let’s see some real selling.

No current EV range is even close to real world estimates. The EPA allows the manufacturers to audit and label themselves for some reason.

That's good that Ford is under reporting then. But over or under, accuracy is still clearly not there, and the EPA should be doing controlled tests across all manufacturers.
Yep.  Just thinking about this whole deal. Seem a little pricey for me. I’ll stick with Ford.

Whore Lucid calls expensive asfuck. Wanted to take Feb 22 60 C but ain't worth the price.
#Leggings 🍆🤤
Not a fan. The tendency to wear them to cover any and all flaws has led to wearing them with skirts and letting leg hair grow out. You can smash a disappointing ass into them and it look halfway decent, but as soon as they come off everything gonna sag. It's like when a pushup bra comes off and the jugs hit the floor.

Yeah yeah I know. But that drop from 325 and subsequent bearishness hurt.
and after PT raises lmao make it make sense
Just wait. Earnings will get juicy. NVDA will likely trade sideways 290- 305 range on the way up to 17th then if earnings go well BOOM. like Denzel Washington type of BOOM
Is SNDL expected to pop after ER?
Not even slightly.

I remember when I bought my first call too
IV crush baby. they had earnings yesterday

You bought MARA or MARA options?

too bad i got weeklies
Somehow I got drunk and bought 20 WISH calls at $5 for tomorrow. For the past two weeks I spent my days knowing I was going to lose all of it.  Then naturally, as WISH does, it gave me a sense of hope this morning that my ridiculous buy was not in vain. Then now, it is dumping and surely will rocket into the dumpster by tomorrow EOD leaving me with nothing but a big shit sandwich. Fuck you WISH. You dirty whore.

Lol its not on a downward spiral its been chilling between $50 and $55 for 3 weeks
Yeah I guess you're right, I just assumed if something was going to happen, it would be the other day when it shot up to around 54 and some change
It did that today 👀🔥

Plays like PSFE, Z, CHGG, PTON are why don’t want to fuck with earnings anymore. 

Shit is just not worth the risk.
I learned that lesson long time ago. That's why I always sell no matter what. I sold SOFI yesterday. Hurts? Yes, but that's my rule.
I rolled down my short calls earlier in the day but by close they were ATM and I braced for impact. Ended up making basically max profit with buy-write Nov 19 19.5 calls. 

Was very lucky and will not do it again
Cool!
> I'm not sure what you're referring to.
anecdotal but it *feels* like if the trend is downwards into earnings, it pops. If its running up into earnings, it drops.

The real question is who buys it…..ever lol

Down to 0
Imagine shorting a stock that fell 40% in one day. It’s dead. It’s not dying any harder.
It can definitely die harder but just slower the next few days. Might not find its floor til next week.
how reliable is obv divergence? if price go down but obv stay same or go up, seems like a good idea to buy da dip yeah?
vix going back under 20. you know what that means

It's all but a long ass wick now but I don't feel good about this in a bullish stance
This is fairly normal. Somebody fat fingered an order with zero volume.
I have puts for next week and calls for December, I think I should be alright regardless, I just don't know when to get rid of these hedged puts
Spy. For a second there, shit was at 463 again
What's premarket
China is up 2%. Futures are up.
it is a bull trap. SPY should see 445 first
this is the confirmation bias i needed
Someone in here downvoting everything again🤣🤣

The most retarded stock will repeat what GME did last year. Hold on to your butts folks. WISH is going to $420 in January.
Wish is a shit company
So is Game Stop yet here we are.
Today looks like we setting up for the biggest bull trap in history
I don’t know why it is so hard for all you dumb bers to accept yesterday for the dip it was. Calls are the play. New ATH Friday or Monday. Fuck, maybe even today.
Bulls be fucked on job report, because I know.
Bears really are this retarded, aren’t they? Jobs report was released yesterday due to Veterans Day holiday today, dumbass.
Jobs 2.0 bitch baby
Spy just fucking died
No someone exercised
Elon sold $5 billion but Tesla up premarket.

Then again the bond market is closed. Nothing to really drag anything away from stocks
where are you getting the $5 billion number from
Because we knew about the sale, didn’t know when he’d do it. The sell explains the Monday drop which played a big part in how severe the Tuesday drop was. Knowing he sold takes some of the fear out
some retard just said "who buys puts the 2nd red day in a row" like we didn't just have 8 or 9 green days in a row. fucking moron.
We also went red for almost the entire month of September. People here have the memory of a goldfish tho.
LMAO 😭😭
I don't think you understand the context of the market.
I don't think you understand the words context or market.
Fuck my cash and sweep fund didn’t settle for today because today is technically a holiday (veterans day). Thank you troops for saving me from losing money and also fuck you troops for having me lose the opportunity to make money off the meme stonk of the the day BLZE. Jokes aside, thank you for your service. Now one of you vets wanna loan me 10k?
Schwab? I was wondering why my sales from yesterday were sitting in sweep not settled.
Chase…. I might switch over and see if I can get an instant deposit. If you sold Tuesday you won’t get until Saturday…
I'm on Schwab, most options settle overnight. If wed's sales are held because of a bank holiday I'll get it tomorrow.
Bulls dying today derp derp
there are no bulls left. they all died yesterday.
$PENN Leaps? Good risk/reward
I get that a TSLA 400 Put for 2024 is 4k, but how is this not free money? It just needs to move like 20% down in the next 2 years for it to be profitable
Long term puts pretty much dumbest play you can make in this market.
If that's your play it might be more prudent to short the stock itself then cover after it's dropped 20% but if you go for a Long Put LEAP try and buy it when IV is lower and get the premium down
true, i appreciate it. i know nothing is free money, just wanted to ask
Ur better off just shorting the shares directly..
Crash alert crash alert

It’s 11.11

What are the chances wish goes back to 5 dollars today
Lmao
Probably .5 seconds after GME hits 1000/share. I’ll hold my breath though.

Guys yesterday I had a lot of my comments downvoted. Today is a new day I’m gonna get all upvotes I can feel it
  
Edit: guys what did I just say
I upvoted you <3
Aww thanks ❤️
Honestly though, if you're not in GME yet and you think maybe just maybe there's even a small chance these crazy motherfuckers are right

Why wouldn't you grab a share at 210 here just to say fuck it I'm never selling this and see how retarded this could get.

I mean just for shits and gigs right? 

Can't imagine being here and not having any skin in the game for this fucking legend and the greenest stock of the year
just get in BBBY instead ;)
Balls deep in both but mostly GME, lil bro is cool 2 tho but it's not about to revolutionize the entire way securities, collectibles, games and art are traded

lil bro is about to hit a growth spurt
Lmao bro brings politics into a stock forum keep dat shit to yourself
I agree but dislike your comment for your political intent
Ok sorry
You look a little lost bro. This is a sub for making money, not bitching about how you can’t creep on kids anymore.

curious why people on here are anti-dave Portnoy? those who are against, have you heard his side of this rape story? (Penn to 100 mid-22)
He's not entertaining in the least, his on-screen presence is like the human manifestation of high blood pressure
to all the comments.... what is to be said about 1. a person can change - those comments are 5+ years old at this point. 2. barstool has more women in media than 50% of major sports entertainment companies you boomers watch
Literally no one cares. He’s a douche bag but there’s a lot of douche bags. Millions of them. He is probably in the top 1% of douchebags but again, I don’t really spend my time thinking about it.
also makes sense
Wsb is against him because he’s a paper-handed bitch
now this makes sense
Dude has a history of buying the top and then whining about his losses
Even before the rapes

https://www.mediamatters.org/barstool-sports/barstool-sports-cesspool-misogyny-and-bigotry
Please shut up
That he had a good time?
2 comments that make sense, the rest are most likely jealous because they have probably cast many of the same stones
500C 12/31 DD

Many of you don’t understand the market lag in the summer was because of Evergrande/China (second highest GDP) going into a possible reccesion till of last night. We have Build Back Better coming in and Nov/Dec/Jan are the most bullish months. Also the market is still in the COVID bubble look at Nov ROI% vs the average. The COVID bubble isn’t ending till possibly next year. Watch any FED meeting and they have heavy emphasis of Delta Strain.

Therefore a $30 increase by 12/31 is easily achievable.
Not sure why you think the BBB legislation is going to be passed.  It was widely considered DOA even if the infrastructure bill was going to get passed.  It's going to get a scary CBO score and die.
Today Manchin said maybe not until 2022, this thing is 100% done.
Pelosi says she will pass it next week.
Except despite what she thinks, she heads only one of two parts of Congress.  This thing never passes the senate.
With that thinking we would have defaulted on our debt in Oct. did that happen? No.
Defaulting on debt and getting the senate to okay massive new debt spending is two different things.   The CBO score will show it is debt spending and not “paid for” especially with the SALT tax BS. I’m as sure the debt ceiling will be raised again in December as I am that BBB is DOA.
It really isn't. 

This is going to be like in 2009 when all the Democrats came together over healthcare policy, when then Joe Lieberman from Connecticut held the bill hostage because he wanted the "public option" pulled out----so then the rest of the Democrats caved in and did it, and then Lieberman betrayed them by them by still voting it down anyway.
Because Biden isn’t signing the Infa package yet till he passes it.
Manchin could just as easily switch parties and keep getting elected. He doesn't care.

Edit: ALSO, the president has ten days (excluding Sundays) to sign a bill passed by Congress no matter what. Biden can't hold it hostage.
I haven't seen pitchforks here in a while. I think you bought calls a little early, but I don't necessarily think you're wrong. I'm looking at prices to fall for a couple of strikes in December right now. I think we might have another red day ahead of us this week. I'll be banned for a week come Monday, so I can't poke at you again with the stages of grief. Just imagine I'm saying each stage where applicable.
oh jeez, this is embarrassing. I think you misaligned your prime meridian line with capricorn and gemini. The bad news is that your chart is off. The good news is that the love of your life is on the way (and he's cute!)
Inverse WSB you’ll see you are all retarded after x mas
I like how all you predictions so far have been wrong :)
Elon is finished selling don't be a fool. The bottom was already bought and it's up we go. If your still banking on tesla puts you had your chance for the last couple of days. It's over now. Accept it.
He literally didn’t.
Lmaoo ok go.place puts and watch your ass get fucked
Yea he did bro are you dumb
If you are gonna talk shit at least know what you are talking about.. he sold about 25% of what he will sell
> The SEC filing shows he sold about 6% of his holdings.
That's cap lmaooooo
Wait. Its under $1100.. so where is my 1k?
> I will give you the 1k if it goes to $1,100.
When market opens
Im not making a bet with you… im fucking with you but stop posting misinformation. Yes he sold a large amount of stock that last few days. But it is not 10%. Im not saying tesla wont keep ripping, just stop talking nonsense
> You are right. I apologize for my mistake.
He sold 10% bro the bottom is in its raps
You show me right now where he sold 10% already. If you are right ill apologize. Otherwise im banning your ass for a week for being fucking annoying and doubling down on misinformation
I do know what I'm talking about it we can put money up rn cashapp that tesla stock will keep surging from here on out. We bounced off support around 1015 and closed green. Elon even said he sold 10%. Get your facts straight I'm the wrong person to debate with bro. We can go all day but like I said let's put a bag on it. We dip below 1100 I'll send you 1k we stay above 1100 you send me 1k bet ?
Im not saying tesla wont go up… im saying he hasn’t sold 10% yet… go look at the SEC filings…
> I'm not going to look at the SEC filings.

Why does no one understand that the market is inflated right now? Go look at the last month for SPY its 7% the average is 2%. This is 5% over inflated the market will always self correct itself. The next few days will have a lot of red. If you really want to make money buy puts on SPY500 for 11/19 wait till the 18th and collect. Don't check your phone often it will go up and down. I was down 11% yesterday held strong and came out with 1k.  Same thing for today!
This tale is getting old, don't you think?
The market can stay irrational past 11-19
🌈🐻
Everybody knows its inflated...... has been for the past almost year. This doesn't mean its coming down anytime soon. When will YOU understand?? Its been the same fucking narrative since August of 2020. Clown markets make clowns out of people continuing to try to analyze it from traditional perspective. Get with the times boomer.
Hate to say it, but it smells like a huge market correction or even recession is on the near horizon
Hate to say it, but it's been smelling like that for a year
I hate to say it, but you a bitch

Imagine all the money I would have made it I waited one day to buy AMD and NVDA calls 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Sold my AMD 145 calls this morning at a loss…they would have printed with this last pump…$ROPE
Same here. Down 30% on $345 12/10
Down -57% on $335 NVDA 12/3 calls
Are you holding or selling? I’m down more than 50% on 325 11/26.

From January, that was when they locked out the buy button

5-7 bagger by next week, SPY 450P 11/26. Follow seasonality.
SPY has made considerable gains during this period over the past 5 years
damn I think I might be the only person here to make money off $WISH

bought 5k during the initial hype @ ~10 AH and sold in PM next day @ ~16 only to watch it crash back down to $12 by market close. So many bagholders created that week but WISH took me from 70k to 100k and I haven't dipped below 100k ever since. TY WISH 🥰
Weird flex but ok
I also miraculously made money - I bought and sold twice for a profit during the pump and dump, somehow avoiding being a bag holder. Since then I've been buying in the 4's and selling in the 5's, been pretty reliable strategy.
Last year, I was adamantly an "anti masturbation" guy. However, I started taking supplements to boost testosterone and I could masturbate 2 times every day and still have more energy and libido than I did back then.

Lmao.
This NVDA sell-off is going to be brutal. Take them profits while you still can. Jacked to the tits with NVDA 4/14/22 230p contracts.  

EDIT: I'm not saying NVDA reaches 230. I'm saying it'll head that direction enough that my Limit Sell Orders for 20% gains execute and I can move onto my next play. I won't be surprised if there is a large AH shift in price and I can make much more than 20% like the JD 6/17/22 85c that executed this morning for 27% gains. Could've held for more profit but 20%+ gains are gains.
You’re shorting what’s expected to be the next trillion dollar company? Lol good luck bro.
It appears I made the right play. Had wsb agreed with me I would've sold and switched to calls.
Hmmm
You doing spreads or just naked puts?
Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but I didn't write any contracts so they're not Naked Puts, I just purchased 18 NVDA 4/14/22 230p contracts. I believe the price will head in that direction enough that my Limit Sell Order for 20% gains will execute and someone else will purchase the contracts I was holding. I also think there's a good chance there's a sizeable shift in price AH which could result in well over 20% gains.
RIP bulls enjoy the circle jerking

I like Elon 🚀
I really don't like how the candles on SPY are facing sharp resistance around the 50D EMA. The next hour is CRITICAL for the market.
With the bond markets closed, investors don’t really know what to do. So they’re just bouncing around the EMA
Speculation. Do better.
The bond markets are not speculated to be closed. They are closed. The connection between the bond market and stocks is well established.

Yes he's loaded. I like gold but you need a lot of money invested for it to make a difference. Crypto is trash, but its also going straight up so idk. Diversification is key. You never know.
I think some of the other coins have a future but they are clearly overvalued and most won't survive.  Agree BTCO is also trash and has no inherent value IMO.

not that i have the funds... but how hard is to buy larger amounts of call or puts

EG If I was trying to buy 500 calls on PTON before earnings.. could i get them at bid? or would it push to price up? Or 500 PUTS on BYND yesterday?
Say you’re a millionaire and trade on 100x margin - upside potential for huge wins 
Downside potential for bankruptcy and jail for fraud
At the bid?  No.  The ask, maybe, especially if it’s liquid enough.  I’d say 100 for sure, beyond that might move it up.
oh yes sorry meant ask thanks
> You can place a market order for any number of contracts at the current price.
Depends on the volume. You can see open interest when you look at an option.
what does open interest mean? basically the volume  of order book? but its at different prices no?
NEVER market buy options. You will get fucked especially if they're not liquid enough.

Plenty of LP going around where someone got filled on options at 3.00 when they intended to buy around 0.20/0.30 a contract.
Can confirm.  Great way to get fuk

Only limit buys unless the spread is a penny.  Then who gives a shit.  More than that do a limit and if it didnt fill you were too late anyway.

That’s today???? Ohhhh fuck

Thoughts on RIDE seems to be trending on good news??
The dilemma is now; do I take what I’ll make this morning from pre market or do I chance it for a third day in a row? (The first two of which royally fucked me)
UPST earnings dragged my LC down, but SOFI dragged it back up some. Thanks SOFI gang.

Why?
Insider buying
I still don't know who $TELL insulted yesterday for it to get beat down that badly.
Energy no bueno. Btu and tell hurt me
What's the plan with SoFi for those with weekly calls ? Sell right away ? Wait until it moons to $30 tomorrow?
Always sell volatility, first 5 to 15 minutes,
Let someone else get the  Iv crush
How do you get a good price tho. Im worried a market order will sell these at 0.01
Use limit order 
Find a price you comfortable with or fits well with your sell model 
Such as implied movement percent target for stock price With price change times delta
depends on what the momentum looks like, but i'll probably take profits early and then regret it by tomorrow.  its my MO and i dont know how to live without regret
Will sell my cost basis on the $23’s and see what the rest of the week brings.  Upgrades are coming soon - that’ll boost too if it lines up with a green day

If we could go briefly red at about 8.45 so I can load the fuck up that would be great, thanks.

Yes.

If the asset is "JP Morgan stock" or "Blackrock stock", sure.   Anything else of value would be bought up by all the other banks, of which there are many.

Anybody have the AMEX Plat card? Is it worth it?
> Fuck the Plat card.
If you travel or user uber/uber eats it easily pays for itself.

Also the rental car insurance and free phone insurance saves a bit aswell.
I'll be traveling a lot this year, I have three plans for flights before 2022 as well as some car work so the flight points+spending reward is what is attracting me. I'd never use the uber stuff, I have a bad relationship with Uber lol, is there anything else that would make it worth it?
Honestly I don't think the point system is worth it (unless I've just been doing it wrong?). It's always MUCH cheaper for me to just book through Expedia than using the Amex travel concierge, even with the points. 

Also I don't think the point earnings are that great with the platinum card either. I spend about 5k a month on my card and haven't used any of the points in like 5 years and I only have 190k points....which is only enough for one round trip and maybe a week at a resort. 

So for that kinda stuff I don't think it's worth it. But I save more than the annual fee on the things I mentioned. Also they always have random promotions such as covering your Netflix/hulu bill for months at a time. Last year they basically gave me a free $100 to spend at both best buy and target so that alone was $200. Lastly the insurance definitely gives me piece of mind. Not ever having to worry about losing my phone/airpods because they'll replace it for free. A couple years ago my new $2500 macbook was stolen from my bag either on the subway or a restaurant. I filed a claim with Amex a they instantly refunded me the money to buy a new one. That alone is enough to cover the annual bill for like 5 years not including any of the other benefits.
>It's always MUCH cheaper for me to just book through Expedia than using the Amex travel concierge, even with the points.

That's my concern, i've always been a cashback guy because I feel like I would get screwed with the miles through shitty flights and dates just to use the miles. It also wouldn't sit right with me having to spend more on a ticket just so I could get points rather than get the cheapest/best ticket if it meant going directly through the airline/other third party. But those other things you mentioned sound awesome
Yea bro, but even if you don't book with them just the free lunge access alone in airports are worth it. I travel with my girl about 10 times a year and I save atleast $2000 on just the meals/drinks I would have to otherwise buy if not the for the free stuff at the lounge. 

I figured I'd spend about $50 on meals/drinks each way on a round trip flight for each person. So that's about $200 per trip just on the food/drinks I don't have to pay for at lounges. Also it's nice to relax a luxury lounge with luxury seating/bathrooms while waiting for my flights at airports. An added bonus is i can just leave my luggage around my seating area and never have to worry about it for the duration of my stay since the peasants don't get in there so no one messes with anything, also the staff is always keeping an eye on everything aswell. 

And I rent a car each time I travel. The platinum card automatically gives you rental car insurance if you pay with the card. So not having to pay for the expensive (mandatory) rental car insurance alone is worth $200+ every single trip.

So my point is my platinum card easily pays for itself 10 times over every year with the amount of money it saves me even without using the travel point section of it.
I have the Walmart card.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

DIS monthly 5% OTM calls seems to be a sensible and conservative obvious play today. Someone tell me why that would be wrong.
I was just looking at those as well. im just not sure if 1 month out is enough
Yeah true. Got in just about at the bottom today and they’re at 5% profit already. January is probably better to take advantage of Holiday bumps if any.

It's mostly luck but I've been mean green for weeks now. Bought the SNAP dive, had MTTR for a while, lots of NVDA, RBLX, SOFI, and PUBM round out most of my portfolio.

I have the strongest urge to bet against Elon. Probably a bad idea.

Why does it seem like Xbox Series X is so much harder to find but PS5s are reselling for so much more? Does xbox suck that bad now?
No games vs PS5 exclusives. And if you have a PC, you can already pretty much play any xbox game
This. There is absolutely no logical reason to buy an Xbox, now that the Xbox exclusives are on PC too. The only reason to buy a PS5 and a switch are for their console exclusives.
I think it would indicate the opposite. Higher demand means lower supply and higher price.

HTZ is already getting its dick out. The option chain closed the day after IPO for some unanswered reason. If it re-opens, this will go HOOD ipo mode.
Omg psfe what happened

Yo idk know who just bought my PSFE calls for more than what I paid for them…. As the stock drops even more.. 😀😂🤣😂. But good luck 🤣
So many people entered short positions anticipating a bond market sell off tomorrow but it will be tame because of Russia FUD. Biden cares about the market he mentioned it was all time highs when he campaigned for the loser Virginia governor.

Honest question, anyone have any opinions on QYLD?
I have around 1000 shares and every month i buy some shares, will continue to hold them and buy more shares with the dividends.  Boring ass ticker, but nice safe place to put some gains from risky plays that pay off.

Is PYPL a good buy rn or can it go lower?
Both can be true
The incline in NASDAQ stocks corresponds with the double-top decline in Rivian and the very recent red candle in NASDAQ corresponds to a green Rivian candle. Not exactly a smoking gun, but if you were wondering if there was any correlation with the theory that Rivian was taking money out of Index stocks, there you go.

TSLA pump fake af. This ship is still sinking my guy. Got a week until the 🌈 🐻 go back to hibernation
Ya should've hedged
I’ve made 35k trading puts last week and only held 3k overnight so I’m good. But if it moons back to highs I will 100% go short again.
Damn gj. I held on my puts like a dummy and just hedged. Looks like I'll be walking away breakeven. The 20k missed gain kinda stings tho
I feel you. I had 15k more gain yesterday and my finger on the sell button before the huge pump at end of day.  Watched it all go and got out even. Sad times.
The last hour pumped fucked me so hard
So my puts are good? Cuz right now I'm thinking they're down about 30%. Also concerned if Elon sends a tweet it pumps another 5%
Weeklies might be fucked. Those are always a dice roll. I honestly thing this thing will continue down over the next two weeks though.
It will be a small run. I was wrong about Elon. He feeds both the Bulls and bears. Just gives the bulls more treats!
Ahem... still waiting for TSLA breakout. Please papa

Bold predictions.  Do you charge for financial advise 🤔?
Yes
imo the best way to fight this current inflation is more spending and the people who are getting in the way of that spending are actively hurting the economy
How are people with no money supposed to spend more
Stimulus checks?
government spending not people spending silly
while that's a true statement that is definitely not a realistic option. the gov is in a tough debt predicament DUE to over spending. we are in a inflation issue due to the gov printing more money so they can spend due to the debt issue. the best spending would be from the people, but the people are lacking the money. that's the issue we are in
raise the debt ceiling or mint the trillion dollar coin. the debt is not the issue, the arbitrary and pointless debt ceiling is the issue. we are in an inflationary situation *not* because of money printing and deficit spending, but because of supply chain bottlenecks. the people are spending, demand is currently outpacing supply. the best spending would be from the government to increase supply to meet demand, thus decreasing inflation.

edit: in fact, if there had been less money printing and less government spending, inflation would have been so much worse.
Spending on what
infrastructure and capacity
**$BB** will do something today! That's my prediction. Feel free to follow me for more insights.
Not exactly a great sales pitch for me to follow you

Elon sold 10% already like are yall not watching the headlines in the market ???
I see you have some call options expiring tomorrow. 😂
oh yeah, a lot of them, what would this be if it wasn't for weeklies?
I actually don't lmaok
You literally said you have 1260 calls in another comment.
You really doubled down? You arnt right ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Futures fading
So glad I bought 5000 BILI SHARES 1 week ago.
LFG boys and girls!
Are we going downsies

I don’t even have any active trades, yet i feel so anxious. And no idea what the market might do today.
Why do we only give a shit about inflation whenever we talk about it? Like, the only time the market drops is when someone mentions it. So why should we ever give a fuck? I mean like if a news article is the only difference between a +1% $SPY day and a -1% $SPY day then does it really matter that much? I'm retarded just an FYI.


If we can hit 3am and then say "oh shit its 2am now" every October then how much does inflation really matter like
Wait, TSLA went to 1120 in PM, but is below 1100 now?  Elon sold again.  Lol
AH means nothing. Volume is a fraction of daily.
Legit how is AMD this shit
You must be new to ÀMD

Is the market closed all day Friday?
Why would it close this Friday ? If you’re talking about Black Friday then it might be closed
Got my dates mixed up. Thanks though.
I guess we're in selling pressure but we keep having theta days, today theta gang will do a big pump for Veteran's day, tomorrow they'll pump again just to make the most of the weekly momentum, and then Monday is pivot point where it can either pump for theta decay one last time or more likely all the selling pressure built up over the weekend can be let out of the cage at once. So for me I guess it'll be a call on SPXS today, another one tomorrow, and maybe a SPY put on Monday. 

^(Don't take this as advice, I have openly admitted SPY has got me fucked up today, this is me testing the strength of my psychic ability. According to what I know from past testing, I should be wrong on everything I just said, but if I'm finally getting strong enough to overcome interference on days like this, I'll be right. Saving comment for record so that I can't have selective memory in hindsight)

I wouldn’t go all cash. But maybe 40%
Yeah…I’m keeping all my blue chips tho…I may sell Apple
Yeah I’d agree I might keep some to see what happens with that apple car thing but who knows.  I’m raising available cash position but I’m scared to get all the way out….my fear is always just making .01 in my savings while watching the market make 28% this year lol who knows how long the markets can stay irrational don’t want to miss out but don’t want to get burned.

[deleted]
Is that when you buy and sell quick like day trading?
tsla calls? seems too obvious maybe
Depends, is that 2k just funny money? If so then you can have some fun and bet on some stocks of companies you like/use. If that money is your livelihood then stick it in an index fund or ETF. There are some good ones with great returns. The majority of people here are playing dice with their life savings through puts and calls, and 2k is not enough to see any relevant gain following that strat.
Thank you. Yea, my plan is to just start an investment and add to it over time. It is long term, for sure. I was decided on ETFs. I think I should do tech and real estate ETFs. You think I’m going in the right direction here?

ok i've been looking through elon's filing (too lazy to add up all the stocks but he's got millions more to go), and he's at least not dumb. he def decreased the amount of shares when price went close to a 1000. Most of us here would be panic selling when price dips below 1000 lol. Matter of fact he only sold 400 right at 1000.
Anyone have any idea as to about what the SOFI 25 calls expiring tomorrow will open up at?
You’re facing both IV crush and theta today. 

Good luck

How to determine if capital gains are short/long term? I understand that long term must be held for a year, but if I automatically invest in a mutual fund monthly will I ever be able to take long term gains, or will that year timer reset every time I add funds?
Step one: dont buy a mutual fund.
Depends if you use LIFO or FIFO when filing taxes, and how much you sell/withdraw
Shares you've held longer than a year are long term.  Your broker, if they're competent, keep track of it.
People live with 30% inflation in emerging countries did you faks think about that

Yeah looks bullish. There is a lot of selling happening at 42+ but the good earnings report and the volume ramp up looks like it has potential to break through. It will be a rocky road through 42 but if you have conviction in the stock, I would hold

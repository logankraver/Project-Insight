The vanilla subs of Reddit unironically crying that Congress should raise capital gains taxes goes to show how financially ignorant people are.

I don‚Äôt think the echo chamber realizes that Billionaires leverage their net worth to take out loans to fund their life styles.

Shares only get sold as a last resort to fund something big like expand their corporation into different states and countries or to create a space company both of which get tax breaks in the end anyways.

By raising capital gains, they only fuck degenerate option players who are up 6,000% in unrealized gains because of 2020.

**[Tuskegee Syphilis Study](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study)** 
 
 &gt;The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male (informally referred to as the Tuskegee Experiment or Tuskegee Syphilis Study) was an ethically abusive study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the United States Public Health Service (PHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on a group of nearly 400 African Americans with syphilis. The purpose of the study was to observe the effects of the disease when untreated, though by the end of the study it was entirely treatable. The men were not informed of the nature of the experiment, and more than 100 died as a result.

Went to McDonald‚Äôs and they only had 4 meals available due to shortages. I‚Äôve been noticing more and more shrinking menus at restaurants along the Metro Detroit area. It‚Äôs crazy cuz you have an industry where workers are demanding higher pay all the while they are running out of supply for the customer. Not to mention 45 minute drive thru wait.

The rules of futures, if u hold the contract the seller owes you those cows and pigs for that price.  When those people buying heard what was happening, those who could take delivery would have thinking the price was going to skyrocket due to a shortage. Except suddenly they cant fill the contract because they killed them all.  At the time it was said the shutdown would be weeks, it then turned to months, then years.  The point is surely people would have wanted the cows even if it was a long term hold position if they had the space which surely some people did. So again the question is, about future contracts that were exercised but the lack of cows and pigs to fill the orders

Noted
Beyond other comments, they also want to limit exposure.  An out of line comment by an employee, while honest, opens them up to potential public, political, and regulatory scrutiny.  They'd rather not risk an offhanded comment about why they censored something, for example, to backfire.

I honestly don't understand how any bull can trade on airlines. Plane crashes? Dip. Earning call, Dip. Somebody gets the sniffles, dip.

So back when covid first hit, china who apparently owns most of our meat factories ordered them to murder n throw away alot of those poke adot things that go moo.  My question is, why did it take 2 years for meat prices to skyrocket.

Did they pull a robinhood or what?

They pulled the study since antivaxxers were spreading it like wildfire.

It was a warm night - unseasonably warm - in the Philly suburbs, out the Main Line just past Conshohocken.  Mosquitoes flocked over babbling brooks.  A bear came out of the woods and took a shit on my lawn.  Then another one.  Soon the lawn was swarming with bears, shitting everywhere.  

Are you man enough to tell a herd of brown bears to go shit somewhere else?  I am not.  Besides, I seeded my lawn with puts this year, and bear shit is good fertilizer.

The bears are looking up into the sky.  I think I felt a drop.  It is still warm and humid and the stillness is deafening.  But it may be a hard rain is gonna fall.  It's overdue.

Someday a real rain will come and wash all this bear shit away.

Ehh Tampa area is nice and very reasonably priced but def imo not the best climate wise. Have you ever thought about the Jacksonville area? Not the city itself but the nice suburbs within 20 miles? Like St.Augustine. North of Daytona is where you get the best weather, I can‚Äôt really deal with south Florida after spending my whole life in the tristate area. But definitely Clearwater is not a bad area just not my personal preference. I def think you should come visit once and see if you can handle the heat if you‚Äôre from the north. If you‚Äôre a high income earner or your family is, ignore all this and move NOW. Imo everything else doesn‚Äôt matter, my families tax savings down here are absurd, like 5 figures in savings yearly. On top of that if you have kids, UF is one of the best state schools in the country(#6) and is also very affordable. Much cheaper than states schools up north

Bro it all depends on where. There‚Äôs trailer trash places everywhere in the country. If you live in a nice community, it‚Äôs a nice community regardless of what state it‚Äôs in. North Florida doesn‚Äôt have the same issue with alligators and snakes that the south has, it‚Äôs pretty rare. North Florida also have very manageable temps, better than the major cities in Texas imo. Not much of an issue with hurricanes either up here. I‚Äôm originally from the northeast so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm used to the south either. I‚Äôm not even mentioning the multitude of benefits down here.

"We're at 125% national-debt-to-GDP. And we are not Japan (i.e. a nation of savers). That means the only way the country gets through this is either a world-destroying default or several years of negative real rates. Inflation between 5 and 10 percent with yields a few points below, turning the Fed and any other bondholders into giga-bagholders."

I've seen this futures movie before, it keeps going up with it going barely positive around 730am, then slams -1% down to start the day of trading at 9am. It's titled "Monday Morning Bear's Delight."
i didn't say they wouldn't taper, i said i don't think it's gonna happen until December at the earliest.
Buls
You have puts, huh?

Well I made a goal to turn $1k into $10k by EOY in March. I got all the way to $4.5k and lost it all with Tesla calls last week. I have $200 left to turn into $10k. It‚Äôs fourth quarter with 0 time outs
They can when fed announce taper in November
It‚Äôs been there 5 times and found buyers every time. 

Good luck shorting there, I‚Äôll be putting a buy. My short would be at 445. 

Good luck üëçüèΩ

Why?
Yeah I purchased in March/April 2020 when the market momentarily collapsed
Thanks bot for some negative news...
Oddly specific but ok üëç
they will once they realize tapers not happening yet. this is pure speculation, but i think mid month well start to drop. that plus bad jobs report means fed won't taper in November, and yields will drop.

just wait until the Chinese housing market goes tits up and causes a recession there.  30% of GDP (6% in USA)  Medium size crash = national recession.  Global contagion.

Evergrande and Chinese politics will pale in comparison to this.  Chinese residential real estate is the world's largest asset class and most there have most of their wealth tied up in property

Yep it will be like gold. Not very useful but worth a lot.
That's what I mean, though. Do they want to sell their stuff to us cheaper? They're linked to the value of our dollar. Causing a decline in value creates inflation for them as well.
Usually with extreme bets like this they delete their account instead of paying up. There was the guy who drank his own pee though...
Fuck. Took profits too early on BABA. Sold all my calls on Friday. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm still balls deep in SPY calls. Should‚Äôve inversed myself ü§°

BREAKING NEWS: Burry reveals TSLA calls position, had been selling puts to "autists" on the stocktrading website known as "WallStreetBets", when asked about the idea behind this move from him he stated, "well I knew these autistic neckbeards would rally against me when I revealed my short position so I immediately switched to long calls and have been selling puts to the boomers and autists who followed my initial short position reveal, been making a Killin' ever since".
BABA is more oversold than NIO but definitely a good sign.
NIO has been trading in range.

BABA has been trading in a downtrend.

Also they aren't even in the same sector. It's like seeing TSLA up 8% and asking "what's that mean for DIS?"
he ain't shitting around that's for sure

Wish I reloaded more PDD calls when it lost $90 again.

This shit is gonna recover a lot more than JD and BABA if sentiment shifts.

Shout out to Cathie for buying the dip from $160 to $140s then panic selling in $70s.
It was a make up call. The holding was atrocious
Just remember most of these people are part of the GameStop cult crowd so they have zero clue about fucken anything in life

Snap puts when it was like $10 lmao
Almost had to go all in buying every last dip on BABA over the last 2 months. Avg cost is like $161 and with margin. Hope it ends up being worth the stress
He‚Äôs long corn üåΩ and does lay the case out for a break out above 65k but he‚Äôs sticking to the 15-20k price for now‚Ä¶

Nice to have you
QQQ, IWM, SPY, etc, all down right now. Everyone seems bullish for tomorrow so maybe this is the dip to buy?

Probably pulls back a bit if tech continues to sell off but like U, NET held strong last week so I wouldn‚Äôt bank on any sharp drops.

The bear is elated, and we share a couple beers. While he's drunk, I get my .45 and shoot him. Two in the chest, one extra in the balls for good measure. Before his life slips away, I show him that the put positions were actually in my paper trading account, and I open up my RH and show him my calls. He feels betrayed as he's about to die. Damn.

Then I take the bullets out and cauterize his wounds and took him to a vet to get surgery. He wakes up and sees me there and thought he'd been sent to hell. I pulled my TD App out and show him my HUMONGOUS put positions (100x the RH call positions). He's happy. All is forgiven.

Then I pull out my .45. You know the rest.

BABA shares are fungible. As per the VIE arrangement, 1 share of BABA in the US is equivalent to 8 shares of BABA in HK

https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3039859/explainer-what-fungibility-and-whats-big-deal-alibabas-fungible

To not have huge arbitrage opportunities (like in the link below) between the two exchanges in price, usually BABA opens up in US pre-market with the closing price in HK and opens in HK with the closing price in US

Hi
I have this employee who keeps whining about his old job. I think I‚Äôm just going to fire him. Might tell his old boss too.
And that‚Äôs true, if you believe in baba with all your heart great.
Selling steroids is so lucrative‚Ä¶ order cheap powders from China, costs like $20 to make then sell it for 300-400% mark up. Apple and Lululemon like profit margins 

Not that I would partake in such illegal activities‚Ä¶.

That...seems short sighted since their currency is pegged to the USD.
Would it be weird if I went back to my old job that only has 4 other coworkers, who have all said goodbye to me and wished me well. Should I stop being a pussy and learn to get along with new coworkers ? The assistant manager smells like pure ass and hasn't showered in days. It turned me off within 5 minutes, should I get over it? New job is in the biggest mall with big booty bitches everywhere
Agreed
Don't you think that type of information could be valuable to others? I'm pretty sure the heart is an important organ.
So you got puts or what?
So I‚Äôve just lost 2k in a casino in London and pretty fucked office about it, but I‚Äôm know I‚Äôll not give a shit about the 10k I‚Äôll lose in the REAL CASINO

Go ahead and ask the old boss but don't say anything to the new one. This has been on your mind and if you stay regretful about your current job it will turn to resentment and your performance will suffer. If you can't go back, do what you can to assimilate or look for a third job.

They use it differently. If they are hot, they get floods of messages, so they pick the cream of the crop, if anyone, to actually do things with. At a bar, you‚Äôre in a smaller pool, so there‚Äôs less and lower quality competition.

Yes. I am.
something i've been thinking about for a while, not sure if it's worth making or if people would like it.
Guys should I ask for my job back. I only quit like 3 days ago after handing in my 2 weeks. I make almost the same at the new job. New job is a competitor of the old workplace (telecommunications) and its also at the biggest mall in the city. Should I grow some balls and stay at the new job? Even though learning the system is going to be hard? And my coworker smells like pure asshole? Or ask for my job back? I worked 3 years at old job
Iceland did on Friday, not sure if that‚Äôs the one he‚Äôs referring to.
You guys are like 12 year olds. .26 and acting like futures are down 32%

Interest rates are procyclical. Imagine an economy in which the interest rate is only below 2% just before an overheating and falls to a level of 0 in the downturn phase. The output gap is the difference between potential GDP and actual GDP. In an economy as described above, there is hardly any output gap. This means that the economy is growing at its best potential. Assuming the USA grew at an average rate of 2.5% until the Cvoid Crash, it now has the possibility to grow at 3.5%. This may not sound like much, but it makes a big difference in the long run. As a small example:  
  
GDP per capita in Germany in 1918 was: $4700, in 2018 it was $46,000. If growth had been 1% lower, GDP/pc in 2018 would have been only $17,000, if it had been 1% higher it would have been $122,000 .  
  
TLDR: The economy will grow fast af. We are in a new meta thats all.

Seems likely. October is historically the most volatile month. We have enough bad news for the market to pull back, it just seems like a flip has been turned and now the market is anxious about the fundamentals all the sudden, which didn‚Äôt matter all year. And I could see a big bounce after such a correction.
May not be da case for American markets tomorrow

China kind of week
You saying oil fueled the industrial revolution? because that‚Äôs the sort of statements I come here for!
Google HK9988
$CCXI - move to pre FDA approval coming. The drug will be sold at $100k-200k per patient. Estimated annual revenue is $2b and current market cap of $2.6b. No debt and the stock was $70 before fda approval. FDA approved last week and price targets increased to $101.
You hedge your actual positions with ban bets. That way when you‚Äôre inevitably poor, you at least have meaningless internet points.

You need money to make money. That's his message
No I assumed you have. You give off a shit pants vibe. Fuck off retard.
CC gonna crank
You know who you are and you will be in shambles tomorrow
Zoom out
At least until the nukes fly lol
Look at the performance recently.
I know. But when you‚Äôre hitting it‚Äôs fun as hell.
my ass and some sweet E cups
Looking through some of those FBA courses, it looks like a good chunk of those people legitimately did get rich from FBA at one point so it's not like they're selling complete scams,

its more that the problem with FBA is that any profitable method quickly becomes front-ran by others, so that the only people who are making good money are the ones who are coming up with novel ways to game FBA, which is usually used up and no longer profitable by the time it gets organized into a course
Use it to get a good entry and exit - but that's it, the way you use it it's no wonder you don't succeed.
So buy back the calls, then sell the stock. Then sell otm puts.
Stocks gonna moon in November and December, specifically growth. I know it, you know it, the street knows it. So plan accordingly!
Kick em while they're down, that's what I was taught.
Cause it likes to
Bold of u to assume I have not shit my pants as an adult

Too bad I had bought Jan 240 calls when it was at 200, even this upward trend probably ain‚Äôt saving me
Take advantage of HOOD's 0.30% APY

But you are dumber than a slow adult shitting in their pants. Your theory is flawed. You are right where you need to be dumbass.

So, why is TQQQ so popular while VGT is almost unheard of around here?
Edit: answering my own question, for the last 5y, the growth is +1000% vs ~240% which makes TQQQ a beast comparing to VGT
Only down .15% right now

After dealing with FDX earnings I think puts on UPS would work out. The fact that it hasn‚Äôt had any upward momentum is bearish

In a time of unoriginal recycled shit plotlines, I'll watch bad t.v. if it's something new &amp; different.
Honestly could go either way. If you look at the chart for the year it‚Äôs had these great pops where it looks like things are finally turning around before it takes a shit again. But who knows maybe this time is different

‚Ä™PUTS UPST‚Ä¶. 

1.Stimulus checks are gone. 

2. Free rent is over. 

3.Student loans are reactivated. 

4.Many people have decided not to go back to work. 

All it takes is for 1 of the big banks to report an uptick in delinquencies; mortgage, loan, credit card, car payments etc and anything.

If so UPST will fall 20-30%.  ‚Ä¨I‚Äôd also be very carful will any other fintech loan provider; LC, AFRM etc.  They are all flying way to close to the sun.

For those who want to see realtime quotes for Chinese ADRs in the HK market along with their USD conversion (what they close at in HK is usually what pre-market opens at in NYSE), here are the relevant links:

**BIDU**: http://www.aastocks.com/en/usq/quote/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU

**NIO** is not dual listed in HK but you can get a good idea of the direction tomorrow from XPEV and LI  
  
**LVS** usually follows Sands China in HK because majority of its revenues are from Macau: http://www.aastocks.com/en/stocks/quote/detail-quote.aspx?symbol=1928

Not enough people are bullish on SPY based on the competence of the fund's management. J Pow prints the money, but not many notice how the people who manage the SPY index and decide on its portfolio balancing and stuff have been phenomenal at their jobs in recent years. They just keep using safe obvious strategies that make sense without being too controversial and they keep getting it right.
a lot of them are like wed-sunday

I‚Äôm American too.
But ye, the VIPs. 
The portrayal and acting of the VIPs felt very forced and unnatural imo. 
I can check IMDB, but I think they weren‚Äôt American actors so the American accent and English would have been forced.

I honestly tried to sell at close. I was waiting u til the last minute to maximize profits. Kept hoping it dip harder and then fat fingered and the order didn‚Äôt go through. I was up 5.7k on the trade by close. Would be nuts if spy opens -1.5% or 2%. I‚Äôm still hoping it doesn‚Äôt open green. Futures can reverse very quickly. I‚Äôll sell if I see it going up.

No, he explicitly said - at the last fomc -  that there will be tapering soon. Rate hikes are a totally different matter though. Tapering has well beyond hit diminishing returns and needs to be reigned in. He knows that, and new highs on a weekly basis with reverse repo is evidence of that.
$100 oil and $10 NatGas will happen by end of January

The funniest shit all night is when futes opened up they were green, and some unnamed dude was like ‚Äòyoooo I fuckin told you we are rocketing up you clowns‚Äô I shit you not, that same dude later was like ‚Äòwhy are we looking at futes so early? They don‚Äôt fucking matter‚Äô lmfaoooo
luv cancelled tons of flights, blamed it on weather, which didn't affect any other airline. was supposedly really due to employees protesting vaccine mandates
They get bigger over time. God I hope they dont become pancakes...üò∂
[deleted]
And listening to the same fed
The guy I was replying to is trying to downplay the fact that Southwest is having some fundamental staffing issues, likely related to vaxx mandates. He blames weather for all the cancellations, but other airlines haven‚Äôt cancelled flights to the same extent. There‚Äôs always going to be isolated weather events that cause flights to be cancelled, but that isn‚Äôt what largely appears to be happening in this case.
Thats not possible sir

Is that bad? Sounds bad
You‚Äôre welcome to base your opinion on the position of the fed, but the big players in the market disagree. The break even yields in the bond markets are reflecting the fact that inflation will be high.  Inflation is getting out of control and investors are putting their money where their mouth is.

Hey might be time to sell your house for a profit
Just bonds, which simultaneously absolutely no one cares about, but when something insignificant happens in bonds then the stock market tanks for whatever stupid reason. Going from 1% to 1.5% bond rates somehow means we shouldn't gamble on 10,000% bets.
Yall ready for 430 tomorrow
You guys keep making the wrong calls. It‚Äôs like we aren‚Äôt looking at the same charts

Dude you obv. don't know much about economics.You are weightening your subjective and unrealistic inflation expectation against the 4% from Goldman. Modern central banks are focused on inflation targeting. 2021 inflation rate is high due to the basic effect since we had deflation in 2020.

That's the thing, SDC is a great company that is only valued so low because of it's short interest.

97% of it's users reviews are positive, it just released a new patent, it's broadcasting advertising during major ESPN games, it's EPS is slated to continually grow over the next 5 years drastically, and it's just starting to expand internationally. This company will be worth double digits in the coming years regardless of a short squeeze.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

My bull balls were small at the beginning of this dip and I was really scared of the dip going on all September. Now it's done with September and there's hype for October to be even worse but I've stopped finding it scary. My balls have swollen 10 sizes. I read articles saying "brace yourself the worst crashes ever happened in October" and I'm like a kid in a candy store, my face lights up with excitement: "oh boy, my calls could get down to NOTHING! Then I could get... Infinity of them!" I've never known such fearlessness.

So bearish in here. Especially funny given the tiny 0.2% futes that they‚Äôre celebrating. Green Day tomorrow confirmed
It would be funny if we closed Friday at like 444 so the huge number of SPY 10/15 450c all expired worthless and then on 10/18 we gap up to like 452
You‚Äôre welcome on the DD, it was funny how much shit I was getting earlier. This is going down in WSB history.

Big swings usually coincide with some news that actually affects the market. But yeah I've seen +/- 1% in futures get wiped out too
I just downvoted your comment.

FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Rudeness towards other Redditors, ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Spreading incorrect information, ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
 and also assuming that futures actually mean something

When a girl/guy tells you they "Just want to be friends" this is code for them actually wanting you to aggressively pursue them, they are your soulmate.
Guess what, futures don't matter unless they are +/- 1%
*BULLS LMFAO*
no, just dont be a dumbass. Don't short when it's dumping. Short the bounce and use stop losses to manage your risk. When your short is comfortably profitable then you can just put stop loss at breakeven and ride them meme stocks to -90%.

AMC gave a beautiful short opportunity recently when it randomly popped from 34 to 40 without news. These are the bounces big boys are creating to refill their shorts.

Just spent an hour and 45 minutes charting trend lines of SPY off of 180d daily 90d 20 &amp; 10 d. Now that I have support &amp; resistance I‚Äôm more under the belief that tomorrow I have no fucking clue
Can you view futures on TOS?
October is for memes. Margin turned on and giving a fuck turned off.
This aged well
nope

rates raising around the world

party wil be over soon

especially for meme stocks  and digital ponzi coins

meme stocks are actually gonna be the safest short.

So short the bounces like the one AMC had last week.

And look for zombie companies with shit balance sheets and a lot of debt. Higher interest rates will expose them and they will die.
Cut losses and restart. Last year I went from 47k to 15k thinking it‚Äôll go back up lol. It‚Äôs best to cut losses short and try again
Are we trading futures? No.
Usually not a good sign when futures get started like this.

Cuting it from 5.7% to 5.6% ü§°ü§°ü§°

EDIT: Fuck Reuters. This is Bloomberg:

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists cut their forecasts for U.S. growth this year and next, blaming a delayed recovery in consumer spending.    
   
Goldman‚Äôs team, led by Jan Hatzius, said in a report on Sunday that they now expect growth of 5.6% on an annual basis in 2021 versus their previous estimate of 5.7%, and 4% next year, down from 4.4%. The declines were mostly offset by upgrades to their projections for the following two years.                                   
  
 ‚ÄúAfter updating our estimates of the key growth impulses that drive our consumption forecast‚Äîreopening, fiscal stimulus, pent-up savings, and wealth effects‚Äîand incorporating a longer-lasting virus drag on virus-sensitive consumer services spending, we now expect a more delayed recovery in consumer spending,‚Äù the economists said.    
   
That, along with the assumption that semiconductor supply won‚Äôt improve until the second half of next year and that inventory restocking will be postponed, ‚Äúargues for a less front-loaded recovery from here than we had expected,‚Äù they said.  
  
Ultimately, they said the two main challenges to growth in the medium-term were a slowing of fiscal support and the need for spending on services to bounce quickly enough to offset a decline in the purchases of goods.

I mean‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ is any oil a real long term play? As more and more lobbying and corporate money shifts to renewables/clean energy there will be smaller financial prospects and smaller companies will go under. The only long term play I can see is picking one of the big ones that are already transitioning to natural gas, renewables etc.
Second Guess "Well, this could be used for a rag next time I change the oil in my car"
"Oh no, we fired everyone who didn't want to get vaccinated and now our business is failing bigly. WHY DID ANTIVAXXERS DO THIS?!"

We‚Äôve been looking for 6 months.  We lost a few offers in Spring, then we took a break in July and August.  Started looking again 3 weeks ago.  We thought this fall would better than when we started in spring, but it‚Äôs worse.  Fewer total offers but prices even higher.  We just lost another offer last week to all cash
Nah. Nobody was giving a fuck. Even if the president would have died market would still have been green. Those were the times.

Thousands of people worked on mRNA, but Dr. Katalin Karik√≥ and Dr. Drew Weissman are the closest thing to mRNA vaccine "inventors." And theyve never said anything like this.

Robert Malone is just a dude who wrote some papers on mRNA back in the day, then he got covid, got longterm side effects, took the vaccine, then the side effects didn't go away. He got mad and went down the conspiracy rabbit hole. 

Today he just makes a killing by falsely claiming to be the mRNA inventor and going on alt-right podcasts. 

Literally none of his colleagues, or the people who actually invented the vaccines, agree with him. And theyve gone on the record as basically saying he's nuts.

So no, I don't think I'm smarter than anyone. But when there's literally one dude involved with mRNA saying this, when the other thousands disagree with him, I tend to lean towards the consensus. You believe the one outlier, because it fits your bias.

This is his Twitter but if you look at his writing and the medical articles he posts you can see he is a staunch supporter of natural immunity 

I'm not trying to be a dick. It's hard to find this info without really searching for it. Media has done a terrible job of informing the public
SDC looking like the real deal this week.
I just try to inverse u/cashflow_ he seems trurly retarded.

Imagine buying puts at the bottom

Yeah, it doesn't make sense. It's only possible if they purchased at the 16.45 high, sat on them until this week, then sold a $15 weekly on Monday. Even then it's not even a 10% loss...

I always sell CC's on stocks with high IV. Oh no, I got assigned and sold for profit. If I really like the stock I usually just jump back in with CSPs while the IV is still high. Oh no, I didn't get assigned but made like 5% in a week.
That's the one I'm talking about.
I thought I owned the stock, but it turns out the stock owned me.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Sometimes stocks are shorted because they‚Äôre garbage. High short interest is not always a good thing. A lot of things need to come together for a short squeeze to happen and even if SDC has a lot of the necessary factors needed to cause one it doesn‚Äôt mean it will actually happen.

The whole GME thing turned this giant group of ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù in to fanatics about short interest and squeezes. Very few of them seem to have realistic expectations when it comes to this stuff.
This means other shoes are not getting bought. Doubt it'll have any considerable effect unless everyone piled into the same brand. And if it's for Halloween only, most likely everyone got some cheap 2-times-use off-brand shit off Amazon or Aliexpress or smth.

Relax.
*I'm not being political about this, just stating an observation.*

So, I just interviewed a lady from New York and my job is to ask people who they'll vote for in the NY election. I have to ask them about individual politicians they'd vote for and all she would say is how she just votes down the line for a party.

She had *no idea* who anyone even was unless I disclosed party affiliation, except the current mayor, and even said she just votes against a politician (who isn't even in office). She also could not follow basic instructions, like picking an answer from a list. **She was a nice lady**, but I have to say that retardation isn't specific to a political party line.

So, next time SPY explodes, blame people like her for ignorantly voting in retards.

EDIT: edited to remove specifics because people are being people.
**Lets check in on our girl Nancy Pelosi and her option plays**

Never double down on your losses, and never sell CCs on stocks that actually have volatility.

Hey that's a cool anecdote

Here's actual fact: over 96% of doctors in the USA are fully vaccinated.
 https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-survey-shows-over-96-doctors-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19

And that's a stat from June, so it's probably higher now. 

So my point stands for doctors: good, I don't want dumbasses being doctors anyway. I want smart people in these roles. That 1-2% will be a good dumbass purge

I love TSM but that hasn‚Äôt been the case for the last 6 months.  You‚Äôd probably be better off with AMD.   Just my $0.02

What oil companies we talking bout
With continued labor shortages companies will be required to improve employee efficiency more and more.  We are seeing chaos in the airlines from a relatively small number of employees that have walked out.  How can you profit?  Sarcos Robotics (STRC) a freshly minted SPAC who has been beaten into the dirt can help improve a companies efficiency.  They are making exoskeletons for workers like airline bag handlers and others who do heavy manual labor. Lifting 200 pound loads feels like 20 pounds.  It was a SPAC so they aren't in production yet but they are using the money generated from the Spac to manufacture.  I like a lot of the spaces right now because they are all beat to hell.  Anyway here's a YouTube video of the exoskeleton in action:  https://youtu.be/W5P4i-aytws
Can we get a pinned weekly thread for these please?!?!?!?

Ranch Water is a Texas drink that the rest of the country needs to know about. Tequila, triple sec, lime and topo Chico.
Ure a prude. You and my brothers wife should hang out. She just star fishes.
I scored 1000 on Friday at $.6780 near the end of day. Gonna sell 10 $1 calls every week until theyre free shares since nothing seems to budge the damn stock
All the fucking oil calls.

David's tea is trash bro.  Have you tried Jasmine tea that's not from David's tea?
That's alright, I don't want dumbasses flying planes or controlling air traffic anyway. I want smart people in these roles.

You chill out bitch
You have a point
Nope. Open like 711 bb
My goal is to deposit money and not spend it right away so I can buy a fucking option for once
Market will worry about in Dec then?
SNDL shares, 100 a day usually. Hodlin close to 30K @ $0.7585 right now &amp; not looking to sell til at least 2030‚Ä¶.

WSB way too bearish recently. calls it is
You really putting Crosby back out there? ü§°
Futes going to open red because of price action after close Friday and everyone will freak out
Air traffic control walking off the job in protest of vaccine mandates. Pilots might start doing this too.

There are fucking more options than sdc, gme, spy.

Does anyone actually look at the earnings thread?!

$azz has earnings and domino's this week

Y'all need to diversify
Just like your mom's chest.

Rewatching succession s2 to prep for s3.

I mean, it sounds like something someone would say if their account was sitting at -90% or so‚Ä¶. But I like the cut of your jib anyway üòÇ
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
calls
SENS but eoy
SDC Is the only option
I already did that in advance of you getting your calls.
In the year 2024 the market moves solely on Burry and/or Musk tweets.
SDC I guess
Ocgn approval, Gme holding til we break north of the triangle and beyond, Any the green corn play, Geo showing strength while market red, inverse Etfs because that‚Äôs the direction, can‚Äôt prop your shitpile of leveraged derivatives forever, one sketchy game of hot potato they playing with OPM retirement money and peoples lives. Banks greed about to show itself again
Maybe. My puts would print. Super unsure about this week
Good luck
We need more of that positivity and light around here
SOFI

Bruuuub this Packers Bengals game is nuts. No one can make a fuckin field goal

AAP puts, you're welcome
MONETARY POLICY which is done by Central Banks like the Federal Reserve, has macroeconomic policy objectives:

+ price stability, and controlling inflation

+ full employment

+ stable economic growth

So this is why JPow has been printing $120B per month for the past 16 months.  

Yet he seems to be batting zero for three, on those policy objectives.

Oh well, at least FAANG/FANGMAN stocks are absorbing all that printed money.

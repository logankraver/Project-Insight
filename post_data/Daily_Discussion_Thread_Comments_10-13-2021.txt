True, but Tesla did it first, as an entirely EV company that is mass producing. Now they have giga factories. Still not bullish on TSLA right now tho.

63% on spot calls with a disgustingly bad average cost. There were many chances for me to lower it but oh well. Holding until tomorrow let‚Äôs go.
Shorting airline stocks just seem so obvious. Yeah nobody talks about is here
Who is buying NET?

It is due to at least 20% decrease in a day...
Hmmm true story? And if so maybe hes an eccentric, rich, beard neck guy from stocks!
You think we will be green again tomorrow?
Oh wow thought we were gonna dive into the close ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶well that ain‚Äôt happening.

Ah yes Covaxin (90%).  That's one way for WHO to officially leak it.
OH MY GOD IS THIS SOMETHING BESIDES A RUG PULL
Now i am thinking about break even now, fuck this inflation fud and tapering my ass
I don‚Äôt see anybody they look like here talking about shorting the airline stocks. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre smart enough
So bears are dead right
I am in a great deal of psychic pain due to this fake ass bitch ass pump
Fucking insane, 9 straight days of green incl multiple 5% plus days.  45% up from two weeks ago.  Sold some CCs when it was $135 and those are completely dead.
GME holding those gains, hell yeah
Lol got fucked too
It's what we like, finally dumped all my meme stocks at a loss and its paid off great
F, I did similar with some TSLA lol
Close green and open red ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Bears suckin cock to pay their rent in bushwick, Bronx, Staten island
Had we kept on track of the last 8 months of mini-dips and general price increase rate, SPY would have been around 465 today. It's almost better to gauge green or red days against the last 6 months average slope if you're looking at option premiums. In that sense we are very much down right now.
It took TSLA 12 years to produce 100,000 EVs. 

It took NIO and XPEV half that time.
AMD got more gas or should I get out before close?
MM love them darkpools
$F only thing keeping me green.
If your in a hurry to enter a trade, you will be in even a bigger hurry to get out once you get the fill.

So obvious that it's too easy

The market loves screwing the majority over. So, I predict that gainz will hold or we'll pump. Tomorrow AM will prob be red though.
I would hold till earnings at least and see whats up
Dark Arts
I had thoughts on that last time around...it seemed like the 'transitory nothing to see here' lines were getting sold off more and more, like the market wasn't buying it. I know we always hear about taper tantrum, but a slight rate hike to ease inflation and try for a soft landing seems healthy overall, but i'm a moron
My only negative stocks rn are Ford and CWEN, decent day in the end
So another sell off 5 minutes before closing? Lmao
you have 6 months left
Tough guy Josh Brown
Honestly hard to say, this all feels off, this entire situation. With bonds falling after high inflation, stocks trying to rally but the Fed giving a taper timeline and 2022 interest rates are suddenly on the table. If the target is far dated, some puts would make sense not too far out of the money, but timing this thing is going to be hard. There are a lot of people who aren't ready to let a real correction happen which keeps us in the choppy kangaroo market. A lot of markets have already had their 10% or more correction, we're the only outlier. I dunno, this market has been so bullish for so long its hard for me to imagine that they'll let it go down, but there's a more rational side that's like this is the mother of all bubbles and for the first time in memory, the Fed can't use its ammunition because of inflation so it could be epic.
I really have no idea where SOFI is headed

it‚Äôs getting too obvious now
I was sitting on the subway and this lazy dude that looked unemployed sat down beside me. He had a t shirt on with something sarcastic as the graphic. As I looked at his bearded neck he began to speak to me. It was really incoherent, and even more difficult to understand as he was drinking from a gallon jug of chocolate milk,  but I managed to make out a few words, "hedgies", "gamma" and "gme". Any ways at the next stop I got off and some other dude who also got off mentioned that choco milk guy rides the subway all day, until the last train.

Tapering is good.  Unemployment is good.  Inflation is good.  Everything is just fine.
I prefer inverse ETFs or short selling if your account type allows it.  Simpler than options.
I mean true, but the bond market is much bigger than the stock market bonds are $123.5 trillion stocks are like $40 trillion. So you get mega whale investors in the bond market and they tend to have much better information than the rest of us. Whales like nation-states, banks. Usually, bonds are considered the "smarter" market while stocks are more "emotional".
I think I might sit this one out.

TSLA has been building EV infrastructure across the country, too. 

Now, XPeng is doing that, along with some of the other domestic EV producers. 

China doesn‚Äôt need Tesla anymore, and at some point, they‚Äôre going to pull the rug out from Elon. 

Honestly, the fact that TSLA‚Äôs business model relies so heavily on China in terms of production and consumption should give investors pause for concern.

Worker shortage is a good thing for earnings IMOhonestly. Trims salary &amp; benefits, and they still find ways to squeeze all the revenue they can. Some places have given staff 2% raise to help retention, but I don't think productivity has dropped due to this fake worker shortage. Only real shortages I am aware of is truck &amp; bus drivers. Otherwise goods &amp; services still flow. It will take a couple quarters to notice any change in my opinion.

Fun fact for both bears and bulls.  
SPX (S&amp;P 500 index) closed below the Daily descending channel yesterday.

Today is going for a retest of the channel's lower boundary and will be desperately trying to close within it and above the neckline of the IH+S pattern.

If it closes within it, we have an Inverse Head + Shoulders and should see a nice bullish day tomorrow (and probably to close off the week...hell, an end to this pullback?), but if not then the Double Top-ish with yesterday's High should mean we drop into a new channel and the pullback continues.

Good luck.

I‚Äôm comfortable with putting only 5% down. I can make the monthly payment, and I‚Äôm buying in a desirable neighborhood. If the house value goes down, I‚Äôll be good. With the money I saved from putting only 5% down, I can sell puts and make more in profits than I‚Äôd save on PMI
You didn't hear? SPY earnings AH. The CEO confirmed it.
Inverse spy? So buy puts sicne it‚Äôs green today and buy calls if it‚Äôs red tomorrow? That kinda inverse?

Use ETFs only with theta gang strategies. It's not a get rich quick scheme but if you use good entries with a lot of time left on the fuse at least you don't bankrupt yourself.
I still don't understand how people are comfortable with owning high growth tech stocks when it's a certainty that tapering and rate hikes are coming and ending in around 7 months time which is only for two quarters.
Actually delivering cars this month as promised is the only remaining catalyst I can think of for Lucid. I hope they come through. I was tempted to unload my $19 cost basis shares when it got to $28 recently, guess I shoulda.

We are once again pinned to $434 - $434.5 on SPY. Someone tell the MM's that they are replaying yesterdays tape and that they need to put the next one on to play.
Not massive, it‚Äôs barely up.  But yeah I think it goes down in PH
Borrow money from Grandma.
&gt;ess than a minute trading SPY 0dte today. All morning puts were moving cents at a time and I happen to buy puts right as the fed minutes are released

And you gotta admit they're right
Still just sideways ‚è±

It's the funniest thing I've seen in awhile when someone says latinx.
november tapering
The next 7 days will be interesting. Jobs weakening. Worsening supply chain. China real estate imploding. Volume on Spy is also incredibly weak.

Was in the trade less than a minute, sold at a loss of 35. 3 minutes later I would've broken even and right now I would have been profiting.

I lost $140 in less than a minute trading SPY 0dte today. All morning puts were moving cents at a time and I happen to buy puts right as the fed minutes are released. My 434 puts went from 90 to 50 in 10 seconds. What in the actual fuck  is my luck.
What if we just make another port in that empty part of the California to take stress off LA? Just gotta think outside of the box and supply constraints solved.

Inflation is team terf
**FOMC minutes highlights**

Participants viewed November-December as taper start, end in July 2022. Likely to use illustrative tapering path, featuring monthly reductions by $10B of Treasuries and $5 billion of MBS

Participants expect inflation rate to remain strong in coming months before moderating due to supply constraints

Many participants pointed out that rent component of price indexes should be monitored carefully

Participants noted uncertainty of economic outlook remained high

Substantial further progress price-stability goal had been met or likely to be met soon

Substantial further progress maximum-employment goal, had not yet been attained but may soon be reached

Committee says more stringent test would need to be met before rate hike. Various participants stressed that economic conditions likely to justify keeping rate at or near lower bound over the next couple of years

They kind of work hand in hand. Low interest rates and stimulus spending mean that people have more money to burn and more access to cheap debt. COVID has put a lot of people out of work and unemployment benefits are keeping them at home‚Ä¶ lots of liquidity out there and a reduced sum of goods and services available due to lower productivity leads to inflation
Big surprise!!
yeah looks like it spiked 50 bucks in a day.

We didn't really unwind after the great recession, we kicked up fiscal policies favoring the wealthy, leading to a zombie market that's propped up purely by a steady stream of fed bucks.

Anyone got the TLDR on the Fed minutes
He fucked up in two ways - leading on ludicrously bullish investors who thought tapering would never happen let alone the rate hike talk in 2022. Making bond investors think he's really messing up inflation and will have to crash to economy to stop it.
Yeah. The pump looked weak as fuck and manipulated.
Puts?
I just went under contract to buy a house yesterday. With my luck, the Fed will announce tapering the day after I close. Not only will I continue to lose money trading options, I‚Äôll be losing home equity too. Yay!
In the secret market, none of my options expire worthless. Let me know if you figure out how to withdrawal from your secret brokerage though.
from a less than half a point increase?
It really isn‚Äôt and hasn‚Äôt been for a couple months I just get so mad it‚Äôs unhealthy and I lose everything I put in. I used to actually make money my 3 month chart is a straight line down lost 40k pretty much everything I made before sept
BABA was the correct call

SPY options are great. its usually the equivalent of red/black at the day trade roulette table but this week is a mess
Definitely gonna be a red spy open tomorrow
Can we make this easier again please
I bought puts lol. 

But calls are on the table for next week for sure.

IV is the only thing saving my puts!
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
I bought puts. Will hold them till market close. Market secretly somehow didn't like the news.

Yes they do &lt;3
Call holders be like "I have a dream."
SDC musta been taken over by the dentist. Because it‚Äôs doing so much drilling
And this is the best you got, bulls?
Run up is similar to august. The big jump happened in one day. I‚Äôm trading options so it‚Äôs good to get in before IV goes crazy which started today
!banbet just ban me from the market
Nah I‚Äôm good on that one chief. I‚Äôll just take the downvotes like a champ
After some pain, It could shake out a lot of tech first.

Normally it just goes up.  Wait till this week is over.
Let‚Äôs assume your margin balance is 500. You can buy 500/20= 25 shares. You can hold that position until the stock price hits 18$, which is 90% of originally purchased price. However, if you don‚Äôt max out your margin, that buffer is much different.
Yes. You will receive a credit for almost exactly the current price of your option. And then you just let them expire together

Looks like banks just dip no mater what on their earnings, then race back in the following weeks
Basically the bond market yields falling after inflation numbers are investors realizing the Fed is really screwing up to the point that it is going to have to crash the economy through interest rate hikes.

I agree, but consider the fact that he had to think of all of that in order to deny his responsibility. Consider the type of person who just shamelessly says "kill the homeless" like it's funny not to care, without thinking about it at all, and compare that to someone who tried to become a public servant but accidentally became a gangster so now in order to rationalize the way he gets his paycheck he has to come up with a fairly interesting hypothesis about an interplay between climate and sociology that lets him say "we can't just build free houses for every homeless person in a cold state who comes down here to escape winter" and thereby justify the impact of his own choices. This is a reasonably intelligent, grown man who's actually kinda *trying* in life, who is uncomfortable in a life where he gets paid to harass people, and this is how the overlords have convinced him to waste his effort so misguidedly. You can definitely learn something from thinking about it imro

" judging from yield curve moves post inflation numbers, the government bond market is sensing an increasing risk of a Fed policy mistake: a wrong assessment of inflation (‚Äútransitory‚Äù) forcing a  disorderly tightening" disorderly tightening = legit everyone suffers great depression.

Yeah. You can kinda see the oil leak in the second video. It‚Äôs not dripping.
Oct 29 $125 puts are cheap as hell, and the c/p ratio is super bullish - indicating that call premium might get trapped and burned 

Got me considering a short play here
I bought options on SPY for the first time. I now understand why everyone likes to buy options on SPY.

Initial margin is the margin required to open the position, required margin is the amount of margin required to keep the position open (typically about 10% lower than initial margin but depends on the stability of the position) and the amount of cash you have on hand and value of your account dictate how much margin is available to you.

Testing a double 3 month high with a tight run up. Hopefully means sellers at the high are shook out giving way to a run up beyond the high or a swing down. Either way volatility is keu
It's not that I think Burry is wrong...

It's just that he is such a fucking whiny bitch about it with a god and persecution complex.

Fair, but that link merely suggests that in 2008 Goldman's algos followed the trend down after getting snapped out of a long position. It doesn't reveal that they had a false public analysis of the market and took the opposite position. 

In 2008 it was a bad look to be a bailed out bank (which included those unaffected by the crisis) making fat stacks shorting America. This the Congressional hearings and feigned ignorance.
Just remember, it's only illegal if retail makes money.

Do you believe inflation is still below their goal? Do you believe they‚Äôll raise rates in 2022? I‚Äôm an importer and our costs are skyrocketing. Cost of bringing in a container up 400% this year. What do you think?

I argued with a cop in Florida about this once, he said in his city they had to be dicks to homeless people (not his words at all) because the warm climate encourages homeless people to end up down there so they don't freeze to death in winter and being harassed by the police helps make the place less appealing to the traveling homeless type. He said it was easy for me to criticize the attitude towards homeless people, coming from somewhere that gets freezing out in winter where homelessness is a whole different deal.

In the big picture this is bullshit, but it was strikingly interesting to me how strongly the guy believed what he was saying because he doesn't deal with the big picture, he deals with the zoomed in picture where sometimes you're just tired of dealing with crazy drug addicts who came from out of state on the flimsiest of reasons and you don't have the energy to think about why society is really making you do this.

Guess we‚Äôre revisiting ATHs

"Fed officials last month projected price pressures would ease back close to their goal next year, but nine of 18 forecast at least on interest-rate increase during 2022, up from seven in June. The FOMC left rates near zero and said they would stay there until the labor market has reached maximum employment and inflation was on track to exceed 2% ‚Äúfor some time.‚Äù"
It‚Äôs all done in whispers?
That's how you know they're degenerates, betting for no reward at all lol
It's a good day to be a levered goldbug.
The bottlenecks won‚Äôt be resolved for a couple years. The biggest issue is international shipping. Not domestic
I think mods will allow it for the sake of comedy, if necessary I will blow them
Novembear or Decembear
Is it greener over there?
This shit is just ridiculous man
didnt think so, ill upadte if it gets past 50 ever
Mods seem like the messenger shooting type.
tbf, they had a head start on the shambles

cheating, as usual
Don‚Äôt come to the south bro they are fucking SCUM here. These idiots down here will perform a wellness check on the wrong person and they will tell them to fuck off, then that person will get beaten and arrested for resisting arrest. They are pressured by quotas and a corrupt system run by the usual characters.
yo FUCK you SPY mother FUCK
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Yeah the problem is that we can't seem to find sustained buying and bears can't seem to drill this past 428 so we just chop until somebody musters the strength
shit gets to a depressing point, tech earnings come and go nuts, everyone chases, rinse/repeat
That's cool
Ikr only one way to go tbh
Does anyone know how I can buy options in ireland ?

whenever there is a bet, the house should have something on the table as well. Retards are putting 1 - 2 weeks ban on the table but the house has nothing on the table to offer
Is Spy $420 impossible?
Problem, meet solution.
Like 9ish months
If I post his message will I get banned for circumventing a ban?

Ok, so tapering begins some time mid November or mid December. It's always good to get the news out of the way

People just wanna be able to put all their bills on autopay and not worry about it. Once they are able to do that, you get very diminishing returns by adding more

Hmmm I see you didn't take my advice. Well I think an SDC bagholder needs to be insulted somewhere I can't waste all of my good content on you especially since you've just been a punching bag this whole time with nothing to offer. Thanks for playing, pity you couldn't be a formidable opponent

What are the odds useable fusion power is discovered and spy rockets 10% by Friday?
What are the chances of spy dumping 3 pts by close? Asking for a friend.
Okay so one more trade and I get marked as a pattern trader but, I want to get out of my spy calls that expire on Friday. What to do???
Everyone in Shambles
Lmao that volume spike after the minutes released.
u/axemanfromma wants me to pass along a message but I'm not sure if it will get me banned. Mods?
Lots of pain being inflicted in this market.
I live in Maine, the only state in the contiguous US where pretty much all cops are the public servant type rather than the psychotic gangster type
‚ÄúAnd the rocket‚Äôs red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our bull flag was still there.‚Äù
When it still goes up +10% like on Monday and +7% like today...of course
This guy babas

Insomniacs in Europe and Asia have us to keep them entertained.
UPDATE: Sold SPY way otm 0dtes for 130% gain 30 seconds after report came out. Sold SPY puts for 25% loss. Overall up bigly. Gave everyone here the play.

Give it a minute
Yup, looks like I was right. 430 EOD.
Can we just start a yearly purge.
was that fat green dildo an algo glitch or what
Ha ya of course this is how it's ending up, flat.  Of course.
Damn thats crazy, these mins didnt mention anything about the fed chairs who sold the top
i was hoping for a harder "no tapering" line but no this was about in line with my expectations
So who is fuk?

In 2010, people's perceived happiness flatlined at 60,000. 

In 2020, that number is probably 100,000. 

In 2030, whats the number going to be? 200K?

Not that the number matters, more so the lack there of creates misery (roughly quoting Daniel Kahneman).
üôè
It all depends on the timescale. When JPOW started with the transitory narrative, he was expecting inflation to cool down by now.
so now...we're not sure if the notes were good or bad? kangaroo market continues as usual
I love that you can now say "Banbet or gtfo" to the people that come in here and make wild predictions with no reasoning

Lol algos "wait wtf do these notes mean
&gt;With regard to inflation, upside risks cited included the possibility that elevated levels of inflation would continue for longer than expected, especially if labor and other supply shortages proved more persistent than currently anticipated, or that longer-term inflation expectations might move above levels consistent with the Committee's longer-term inflation objective of 2 percent. 

So it's not transitory?

I'm shocked! Shocked!
This green will be completely wiped out by the end of the week, if not sooner. 100% a trap.

It‚Äôs a long long way up for baba
Anyone have a clue what's going on with ALLO? It crashed after the FDA hold, but It's risen about 15% today for no discernable reason whatsoever.

Full disclosure, I bought about $20 worth of weekly calls in the hopes it would somehow recover and I could make bank. I originally planned to keep tossing $20 or so at it every week until the hold was lifted, but then dug a little further and realized it would probably be a few months before that happened and so I just laughed my $20 loss off and figured I'd check back in a couple months.

Then, today, for no reason, it starts rising. Any clues on what could be driving that? The hold is still there and I havent seen any news relating to the company.
I gave up trying to figure out what's going on with natural gas anymore...

It's not even that hard for the government to help here.  You just grab the military and national guard and have them help offload containers and drive trucks for a couple months.   Already paying them and stabilizing supply chains is a national security issue.  For the most part even a little bit of relief on the supply chain would provide a great deal of help in recovery.

180c expiring this week
There's so little difference in a $10 range not sure it matters. I don't trade in max pain for tickers with actual volume anymore, learned my lesson. Low volume can get manipulated easier though. 

If you look at the charts, by the time they've reduced risk through the kangaroo'ing, there's differences of like $50M-$100M  between $10 worth of strikes on SPY. They don't move the whole market to save $50M, but they might for $500M.

If you buy, it will push it even higher
I mean if makes you feel better less than 25% of households report being involved in the stock market, of course they probably dont think of their retirements or 401ks having any bearing on it. 

Also using the word elites or they/them makes you look crazy and by now you should realize the fed wont allow a drop like what you are talking about.

Market so gay, Jon Gruden just emailed me about
Honestly, I just got off work and haven‚Äôt smoked a blunt yet. I‚Äôm sorry
I'd buy spy calls but I know its bout to get Tombstoned
It‚Äôs ok, your dad said you can say fuck.
Rolled 10% of my profits from 435c to 438c. I‚Äôm a mad man.

I'm not sure I have 1 pick but probably lawless, as well as spirted away and inglorious bastards.
SDC creepin. It‚Äôs following its father and mother. Rise young one
$new rsi on the weekly chart at 25, sitting on support, hardly any resistance until 3.4 it‚Äôs currently at .54
Max pain for spy today is $436, for whatever the hell that's worth
You are the one that defended fast food delivery with great interest I must say. If anyone is a fatty it's you. I literally posted against it. Not sure the correlation there but like I said you just turned my insults around on me which brings me back to you bring lazy. If you're not going to cut me deep then go back to your lonely life with your cat in your double wide
i'm just expecting these notes to be hawkish, so it's odd that we're rallying 30 minutes before they release

Put ¬£800 into my first long term options plays in February, sold at a loss for ¬£200 yesterday and then just 'yolod' that last money into 1 GME contract. Already made all my money back and it's been like 3 hours lmao
You're both wrong, bulls and bears are fucked, theta gang reigns supreme this week again
Thinking the same thing. This is institutions trapping bulls before pulling the rug again late in the day.
I‚Äôm the only one who needs to chill? I was fucking joking in my first comment (kind of).
A meeting about tapering and everyone thinking we're going to pump¬ø
Jim Cramer is the type of guy who puts the frosting on his toaster strudels before putting them in the toaster.
I accidentally sold puts on TLRY last week instead of buying them, and I need that trash to moon please
Guess it was the right move after all my calls are up :)

Dips are transitory for GME
This feels a bit like a ‚Äúbuy the hype‚Äù before the minutes. I dunno. I‚Äôm kind of expecting a drill from then until eod. I‚Äôm probably wrong though because I‚Äôm bad at this.
Here we go SAVA. Give us another one of those pops.
Remember the Monday Massacre?

Bears got fuk. Bulls became extinct.
SPY is about to take it's girlfriend on a trip in a van.
$SAVA 's low trading volume today along with the 6%+ pop the past few hours  makes me think you should buy some short term puts.
They‚Äôve already announced their tapering times. It‚Äôs just the market being the market
You know what.

I too will rep our fallen brother with some spy calls

It‚Äôs incredible how much these MMs made on premiums in these past 3 days.

Yes just like that SPY, I‚Äôm almost there
Starting next week the weather generally gets cooler, wyell likely still have the delusion things are still improving outside Biden making an unpopular move causing backlash. Heading toward the end of the month concerns will be dissipated and the indexes will hit all time highs, including SPY hitting near or just past $500.

We will then see small dips and sideways charts until realities get revealed by leaks and then public announcements going into Nov, and by mid Nov, or before, the inflation, supply issues, china housing market burst, and a renewed covid surge due to variants and colder weather will all hit at once.

Leading to 5-7 days of major drops as the big three indexes hit or come near double digits.

Issue is the timing. I give time frames but for all I know we will be in the leak stage this Friday, or it could be mid November. 

Heck it could be tomorrow, it will be when most people are not prepared, the elites and corrupt individuals already know what's happening, they are just waiting for the right time. They will not be impacted. It will be the unconnected upper class and everyone else that will see their assets come crashing down.
they were trying to start a civil war behind the scenes
It went up %5000 It‚Äôs over

Yo how do numbers work again
Jpm alone is preventing me from closing positive.
DKS was a big missed opportunity for me the past year. I wrote a detailed DD when it was under 70 (didn‚Äôt post it) it saw a patch of weakness that I couldn‚Äôt figure out and I bailed because I figured there was something I wasn‚Äôt seeing. Shoulda stuck to my guns.
Gotta feel bad for bears sometimes

So calls or puts for eow?
Hmm !remindme
How about you lick deez nutz!
Seriously, I have a mutual fund that I can't touch because family and responsibility and yada yada yada. It's not much. It's literally decent. Then I put in money that would have gone towards a vacation but for COVID into some meme stocks and other stocks.

Basically, I've got a mutual fund and some stocks. So we'll see what the smart money is and what is the dumb money.
GME just wont stay down no matter what. Its a no-brainer all-in play at this point.

Also, the contract situation is far from settled. That money was guaranteed. Why do you think it was such a big deal at the time? It‚Äôs the most lucrative coaching contract in NFL history. This is going to go on in court for years. Bet.

I dunno man im still waiting for you to "shit" on me. A little disappointed in this exchange I was hoping for a true roast with original insults instead I get "lol u fat n poor lol".

I'm sorry I offended your way of life. If you are that fat and lazy then who am I to judge. Some people's priorities is food and who am I to get in between an obese man and his food. Please take my apology and be sure your trailer is well lit for the drivers safety when they arrive with your $27 double cheeseburger meal.
Just told the girl at the drive thru window about options trading. I said "hey you know how the prices on everything keep going up like crazy?" and she was like "yeah" and I was like "do you think that's about to stop?" and she was like "not any time soon" so I went on an explanation of how you can make big money betting inflation will continue in the stock market because there are a lot of rich people who are always betting inflation is about to stop because they have lots of money and it's worth less and less so they're desperate to believe they can have all the money without it continuing to be printed. Line was spilling out of the parking lot by the time I pulled out. True story

Another fake no volume pump
Yeah thats a fact. I burnt 3k but now ive saved up and had some nice gains from shares and am at 18k. Now 15 percent in options basically was 100% of what i used to have. But goin all in and losing it all hurts for someone with only 500 bucks. Ive dipped down 7k at my worst and it didnt feel anywhere near as bad as when my account said $35 after losing 3k on slv callsüòÇ all bout perspective
Berz, is this what it looks like right before the next leg down? I think so, but I'm a dumbass so will probably buy more calls.

2 years ago I had $300 in my bank account. I was working minimum wage jobs, lived paycheque by paycheque. Life was hard. To make ends meet, I had to go to a food shelter and get anything they could give. Luckily my city had generous donators and I could live off of some canned beans, without the help of my parents.

Then, I learned about the stock market and the compound gains you could earn from just simply investing. 

Today, I have $100 and I am still living paycheque to paycheque.
Your sacrifice will be remembered

$MU starting! Super easy these days to spot what the hell is going on with the stocks. We are all united and can either walk with the hedge funds/market makers or if we need, sometime tech them a few things like $GME and $AMC.

I'm saying it's no action only dialog after dialog and it's a chaotic mess, plus the I drink your milkshake line is a hilariously dumb attempt at making the guy look intimidating.

Raiders aren‚Äôt losing $100mil. They won‚Äôt end up paying all of that out to him. So he‚Äôs been there for what 3 full seasons? And he got paid for those 3 seasons? They‚Äôll probably end up paying him the rest of this season and be out about $5-6 mil while he‚Äôs not coaching. Then they will go hire someone else for substantially less than what they were paying gruden. Probably make out better in the long run. Don‚Äôt feel too bad for billionaires and their entertainment teams.

I was thinking this was the drink
I'm up a lot as well and I might just sell half and let my other calls ride. I think it could go up more after the event and then may level out again or pull back in the next month. We'll have to see

GoPro‚Äôs chart today is probably the most beautiful thing I‚Äôve ever seen
Could really go for some positive volatility at the moment.
At 2pm satanical horns are gonna pop out of JPOWs head, the market will be bathed in red and Rob Zombie will be heard playing in the background.....
I sold in the morning for +15%.  Went up by another 9% since then.
Same... WSB is odd how it hates other sectors that are not MEME stocks. It seems to dislike the resource and commodity sector in general, along with silver, gold, and uranium. I kinda get the silver/gold (it's a boring boomer investment) but uranium is set to blow... the uranium story is getting pumped and money is flowing into that sector. Something clearly happened that made WSB hate uranium for whatever reason. Makes no sense...

The Raiders lost 100 million dollars hiring John Gruden. It‚Äôs absolutely money related. When are you people going to realize that bigotry is bad for business?

To answer your second question *again*, we know Davis didn‚Äôt know *because he hired him*.

It‚Äôs because they call specific homeowners who are not renting their home to ask them what they‚Äôd rent it for and base their numbers off that. Nothing to do with actual rent that real people pay.

i'm really torn because i love this company and i love the stock. I also think they have space to grow. But the stock's been so up and down, and right now I'm up like 20%. What do you think the odds are that it falls off a cliff again right after the event?

Ur fukt
Small overall market size. Several reactors were shut down following fukushima and lots of war heads were getting decommissioned, meant that there was a stockpile of uranium for existing user to get through. Sprott (a big resource organization) started a physical trust in the summer where they buy uranium and then sit on it for perpetuity (think fort knox but with uranium). Since the overall market is small, they have been able to eat through alot of the existing stockpile. Additionally, more U is used than is currently being produced. it is widely agreed that cost of production should be $50-60/lbs, the price has been moving up from the 20s and is now in the mid 40s today. there are a few guys on twitter to follow to read up on it. most of the tickers are too small to mention here. Just search U308 on twitter the top "minds" will show up at the top.
The Fed meeting's minutes are leaked out.

Spy has deceived me again. Sold monthlies and weeklies at the bottom fml
Last 5 days have practically been zero volume all day and a big volume spike sell off at the end of the day. Basically the big money is scared and not sure what the market is going to do. They are refraining from selling or buying and then at the end of the day when there‚Äôs no conviction to a bull trend, they sell off some of their positions out of fear. It will happen again today.

\- China about to fucking implode

\- Fed talking about inflation being here to stay

\- Consumer sentiment in the crapper

\- Goldman saying USA = shit

\- US workers living on Xbox and Pop Tarts

\- China and India can't keep the lights on

Yeah I don‚Äôt get it either. There was a little chatter a few weeks ago but no one is patient here so they lost interest quick. They‚Äôll all fomo in at the top don‚Äôt worry.
BYND calls
I made a ban bet a few days ago that SDC would go down 1% within a week. 

Clearly I was too much of a coward‚Ä¶ I could have put -5% in a week and still been totally fine.
yeah you should reply to that guy instead of stating a new comment thread too!!!
Can you buy a shit ton? Try and see if they will fill--high open interest but no volume today. Currently ask is 8.50 so breakeven is 86.5. Currently at 86.69 as I type this.

Would need to drop about 20 cents to make a measly profit. Every bit lower than 86.50 would result in additional profit.
No way.. there is sooo much room for this to run... just remember whatever pull backs/profit taking happens does not change the end goal/price
Memes aside, apes have to be the most sensitive folks on the entire planet.

You make a little joke about GME, and you get like 15 deranged replies, PMs, and people going through your post history and replying to shit from like 6 months ago.

How about you only show up on days GME moves over 5% then you can fuck off the rest of the time

Shouldn't take long.
Inflation tends to be self-sustaining for a while, which is the scary part. People have expectations about inflation which they will use to demand higher wages, or higher future prices on contracts. The labor shortage is still very real too and likely won't be worked out in 6 months.

If your stock shoots up 10% on one day and recovers with +4% today you would be happy too. Stop being so ignorant, it¬¥s the same with any other stock

Opened +1%, quickly dropped to -4% in 5 min and now I‚Äôm sitting at even. Three more hours of fun!
The fact that we're not rolling over to re-test the recent lows might be a sign that we're establishing support and will go up from here... eventually

I like it better this way
I just skimmed the FOMC minutes from a previous meeting to see what could be in the one's being released today that would spook the market. 

There were alot of words, would take me an hour to legit read it and care to understand. There may be something of substance in the one's released today, but I don't expect it to deviate from public statements or sentiment.  We know they are likely to announce taper next month, we know inflation is higher than they'd like. We also know that the markets have pulled away from ATH already, so I don't expect these minutes to move it more than 1% in either direction. 

In other words, Berz should hold their 415p for 10/15 in anticipation of the minutes being released and Bullz should hold their 450c and we all get fukt.

Spy you bitch
Bought half and half from there yesterday
How much? That sounds nice.
What are u going on about?
I agree. It's also been a terrific boon to the haves while really harming the have-nots. So many people are being priced out of the housing market while also being faced with investing in an overvalued market or letting their savings be eaten by inflation. The economy just seems so unhealthy right now and the bubble is part of it.
Yeah so I think you missed my point.

I shit on poor people who think paying someone $8 to deliver a hamburger is pure insanity. 

What‚Äôs actually insane is that someone is willing to do that for $8 (probably more like $4 since there‚Äôs no way they get the entire fee). 

But I suppose if I was poor I would look at that $8 and think, ‚ÄúHOLY FUCK THAT‚ÄôS LIKE MY ENTIRE PAYCHECK‚Äù or whatever $8 is to a person like you.

PROG anyone?
I think TSLA finally gonna go down today a little
URA
I did not expect that mid lunch rise to 444 from SPY. But I do anticipate an after lunch fall under 432.
I generally don't understand the hate for uranium and I guess silver on WSB... but especially uranium. Can someone explain that to me? Bc uranium seems like the trade of a life time over the next 1-3 years. For uranium I like DML, WUC, FIND, and BSK... those are the tickers for the TSX in Canada.

Everyone has different styles and different strategies work better depending on market action. In a bull run, buying atm calls on solid growth stocks (apple) is good. 
Right now, I‚Äôm doing theta gang trades.  Basically you sell options instead of buying them. Selling covered calls/puts is conservative but requires more cash. I‚Äôm trading credit spreads mostly. 
For instance, sold $20 put on X, and bought a $17 put, both with 11/12 expiry, and pocketed $78.
Only need $300 collateral. As long as X stays above $20, I keep the credit.
Once the spread is worth ~50% of the credit, I‚Äôll buy it back to close the trade. Hopefully that happens by halfway through expiry. Which would mean about $40 on a $300 investment in 2 weeks. 
My goal is 5% return every month. Which allows some of these trades to lose and still hit that target.
what are your favorite sectors other than tech?

Oh boy, another day of catching the SPY knife to be down 50% only to come back up to 3% profit. I don't think I can get any better than that. Hah

Got my second vaccine shot today. Took a nap after I saw my calls going uppies and felt good. Just woke up and it feels like I got kicked in the mouth. Looked at my calls and now I feel like I got kicked in the balls too.
If you buy SPY in either direction right now, IV spike just before the meeting notes alone will get you 10% return
UVXY head and shoulders earlier was pretty telling, IMO. It could still reverse.

It's fucked because it's a bubble built on all the people who died from COVID, the behavior has just been more and more scammy. We start with Tesla, degrade ourselves to game and theater and now we're just in the thick of the scummiest stuff.

You take the blue pill,  the interest rates stay low,  the printers keep printing, you wake up December 25th with SPY at 500 your index funds up but knowing you can't afford anything due to inflation

If we lived in a true meritocracy/capitalist society every worker for a company with stock would be entitled to quarterly stock bonuses based on performance and would be equal no matter their position, the only variation would be performance no matter what the job.

Wow you still awake üëÄüëå
All meme's aside, if we don't start tapering our everyday lives are gonna start to really suck with inflation rising so much. If you honestly think today's CPI of 5.4% isn't bad look back to 2009 where inflation was under 5.4% for Jun-Aug and still crashed. And if you think it's honestly only 5.4% now you may be actually slow

We're all slaves to theta gang. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
actually sold all of it after my shares reached long term. definitely a missed opportunity cost given their performance this year. but got 30% or so out of it.
going bankrupt at the height of their success. now that's innovation!
who the fuck knows. i just regret not loading up on recent dip.

buying in at this level is def not as ideal in terms of risk/reward tho
Explain that for dummies like me

Exactly this. The last month has been pricing in all the expectations until now so when we remove the negative catalysts we typically resume to bullish, but of course there‚Äôs no guarantee

**[Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron)** 
 
 &gt;Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services company based in Houston, Texas. It was founded by Kenneth Lay in 1985 as a merger between Lay's Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth, both relatively small regional companies. Before its bankruptcy on December 3, 2001, Enron employed approximately 29,000 staff and was a major electricity, natural gas, communications, and pulp and paper company, with claimed revenues of nearly $101 billion during 2000. Fortune named Enron "America's Most Innovative Company" for six consecutive years.

Bear market is transitory
every time the RSI of spy touches 75+, it plummets for the rest of the day. literally a bull trap holy fuk
No, they're just stubborn and stupid.
I actually make more than them.

That's how I make most of my money.  One of mine is about to close early.
Not me I got out with a nice profit right before the bounce, also you're still fuked. Fed will give a slight boost this afternoon and maybe rest of the week, but i wouldnt be looking or hoping for any rippers if I were you.
let's go CHPT to 21
Fake dumps, fake pumps
Was just talking to Axeman and he says SPY will go to 450 by Friday because ‚Äúthe shorts have to cover‚Äù

FSR go go to 15
Seems there's many on a wish and a dream with SDC.
Oh ok anyway doesn‚Äôt look too good here could easily retest low 7‚Äôs
**Market looks ahead. Don't forget that you retards**. Whatever bullshit you're hearing right now or the worst is priced in. We go higher as we start looking at supply chain issues start to resolve.
Bulls have no mercy
2PM BOYS. We either rip for the rest of the week or we see 423 by Friday

Anyone else yolo money into random stocks for the rush ?
These put credit spreads have been such easy money. Way less fun than losing it all on SPY 0DTE though ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Why the drop in yields? Inflation is as strong as ever and tapering Nov 2nd is extremely likely. I think it's going to matter when suddenly there is a lot less demand for treasuries.
Thanks for the fake pump! Got more puts for cheap
Lol Foot Locker what are you doing?
You could just sell it if it's that stressful
Oh God.
SPY 450 seems so long ago...
Bagholders wasn't created in a day , it could take months for smart money to dump their bags on retards and when the dump happens the smart people already got out months ago when there was liquidity.
Ahh spy fake pumping again?
Thats creepy. Whos Angelo?

2 decent green days for me while the indexes are down. Maybe risk is making a comeback. Or just another dead cat bounce before I bleed even further.

Help! my SPY is being ladder attacked!
Finally. Can this be an actual drop
SPY 450 is just a meme
I like how the last 3-4 trading days the big three index etfs DIA/SPY/QQQ start at open looking like a bull run, just to drop down and look bearish, but then just stall in the middle until close giving neither side any advantage and punishing those holding the bag hoping for a move in either direction.

It's almost like something is going on in the background and this is too consistent.

Almost.....

The news: why are so many workers going on strike?? Well that‚Äôs because the pay is shit, and people are waking up to the fact that the elite are parasites that don‚Äôt work but expect the poors to so they can make money off of them. An average burger flipper at a fast food place pays off their entire shift of pay in about 10 minutes of work. The other 7 hours and 50 minutes all profit some clown playing golf somewhere who got a liberal arts degree but had rich parents.
the scale on these yahoo finance charts on the app exaggerate all the moves.  you look at a chart and you think, oh shit it's mooning, but it's just slowly climbing up on the day.

SPY calls for friday, my theory is we rangebound and we near the bottom range will sell at 20% gains or loss
Protip: when you see a huge order come in at a support/resistance on the level 2, 9 times out of ten price is going to smash through that level expeditiously

In a bull market, any news is rationalised as good.  In a bear market vice versa.  In order to profit, ask yourself how is the market reacting to news.  If it's good, the crowd is bullish, go long, if it's bad, it's time to short because everyone is nervous.
After dumping 99% lol
One of these days I'm going to completely break down and finally put my entire port into ATM 0 DTEs on SPY. Must be wild seeing your entire port thrash around in seconds.

Reeeeeeeee
Volume is waning, so not a good sign.
I'll give you some real advice, I'm assuming you are young and newer to the market. Just throw most of your port into boring ass tech stocks. Amd, nvda, msft is most of my port. Then do fun stuff with say..10% of your account. In 30 years you'll be way better off vs chasing overnight millionaire. Probably get a few gme too in case.

In a nutshell: They have a tech that allows for cpu chips to have more cores while being cheaper (they use several smaller chips that are cheaper to manufacture). This allow them to sell 64 cores cpus for less than intel sells a 24 cores cpu. This makes them gain server marketshare very quickly 5% three years ago to 20% now, and accelerating.

In the gpu side they got better but nvidia still beats them in the software side of things. No worries, they will apply the same tech to gpus and beat them with raw power and let the open software comminty take care of the software side.

They are also buying xilinx to get better tech in computation and access to new markets (automotive, aerospace, special computation loads in datacenters, etc).

SMALL VAGINA ELON
are you me? I'm holding jan 2023 35s and 40s
Imagine letting multiple strangers handle your food that you're paying a hefty premium for.
It's this new strain called "Old As Fuck"
Fucking Affirm
No, you just have a lower payout and higher probability of success - not a bad thing
SPY gonna fucking wiggle sideways all day how boring
Same as being poor but with more money.
my rule is if i have to pick up my food at a counter then tipping isn't necessary.
Who do you think is hotter, Bezos side piece or MacKenzie?
Nice flag on PLTR holding above 24
Hes overwhelmed, wish the camera would back off and let him have his moment :)
Too late, I missed buying the top, will get it next time.
I suck I swear I can be so damn right, just need someone else to hit the sell button for me shit.
Lisa Su is BAE
So, only my gold miners are printing? Yay for inflation hedges.
SoFi $20 10/15 and 11/5 calls
Bezos‚Äô chode rocket
Those NET calls someone mentioned in the first 15 minutes are saving my ass from an otherwise lackluster tarding day
Seems like Shatner is smoking the same shit as Biden
Shatner is high
I think that's called putting up for adoption sir
SPY to 430 plz. Gettin wrekt
Holy fuck, AMC tards just won‚Äôt die.
It was pretty bad. =|
He talks slow for a reason....

Bill, shhhhh.

SOFI Lottos üí∏
Subway expensive as fuck
Christ Shatner how much screen time you need?
Fuck all your scammy meme stocks
#TDOC

CHOO CHOOO
It‚Äôs a lot of effort to stick with the flat earth, makes me wonder why they bother. Aliens and regular conspiracies you can‚Äôt prove, but this you can build a rocket strap a camera on it and boom, no giant turtle supporting four elephants holding up the world.
Spy put profits become pltr shares
I see in the big picture, it has a downtrend, today may be a good day for puts if it goes up a little more, but today‚Äôs action is weird especially on SQ
Was Morgan rambling again?
You'd be the king of turd Island my man
What the FUCK do I do with my GRWG bag now??
Why is it wrong? I would let him smash me for 3 millions.
Ah shit grave mistake selling my TWLO calls last week üò©üò©üò©üò© left $6000 on the table‚Ä¶
I'm getting tired of every single place I go to eat asking if I want to leave a tip. No Subway, I don't want to leave a tip, because I'm poor, which should be evident by the fact that I'm eating lunch at Subway.
TSLA IV dead. Need some volatility so I can sell some puts.
Live schlong and prosper
Tim Apple in shambles
You got a snort out of me
They will be fine.
ROFL. Not that retarded to go for a subscription service.
Somebody Reboot Shatner
Musk fucked hotter goth chicks like Grimes , SpaceX has accomplished way more than Blue Origin , and Musky boy is the richest person on earth currently.

Lol.....imma ü§°.  Glad I got in cheap and out at a decent price.  It was a good couple weeks
gme no volume, amc is whats poppin rn
i'd be so stoked if burry got banned from twitter that would be fucking hilarious
Get your AMC lotto
Imagine picking up your own food.
shatner has really really lost it
Thought they were gonna kiss
Don't speak too soon sir. You know the big boys like to play when the doors are closed
imagine not having enough money to worry about paying double for fast food
CRWD and DKNG were my biggest winners through the spring and early summer, but they've been pounded into the dirt the past two and a half months. It's nice to see them showing some consistent strength this week despite continued market chop!
what if bezos and shatner are two robots
Then I can have a monopoly of shite
GForce is not fun. He probably feels ill.
Can spy just go back to 331 please....I hate this sideways shit
Bezos still wearing his full space suit is fucking hilarious
You talk like a hype man for a rap artist.
So TSLA staying flat has got me stuck because I physically can‚Äôt sell my puts even though every single indicator says üìàüìà
[deleted]
Because bulls are dumb
It would probably be fucking cheaper to take a damn uber through the drive thru to be honest
I tried warning people that LCID was a ü§° move

Bears driving Shambleghinis after this
Bezos and Shatner having a bro moment.
Gold gone choo choo.  Spy gonna go poo poo.
Zoom out on the graph bro. Look for general trend lines
I accept your apology
Shatner is tripping
Webull is my hidden ‚Äúbank account‚Äù

CHPT is coming back to green

For sure annoyed with the champagne sprayed in his face. He's 90 years old. He doesn't want that shit.
Yes because the better 1/2 can‚Äôt chump out on their part of the bills
How can you even be bearish on BB üòÇ
gme getting some volatility
OCGN making a valiant effort
bond market is pricing in more rate hikes in 2022 but equities not really reacting ü§î
I want to believe RKT is up today because people heard about a rocket launch and wanted to own the company
I‚Äôm a little lost, I keep thinking I know how the s&amp;p will move but it‚Äôs all over the place, still just watching at the moment
Jeff is like, "this rambling old codger is killing my excitement and high"
Imagine wasting your own time to save $10.
Imagine being so poor you can't pay for convenience ü§°
Rambling like a senile old man....
Good for him enjoy that papii üò©üí¶

Is it wrong for bezos to smash ig models in every city he goes to? Or should he just do whatever he wants cause he‚Äôs rich. On one hand, people on the internet might bully him but he‚Äôll cock up a few models here and there whenever
I feel like when bezos was just shaking the champagne bottle and spraying it around, the expression on Shatner‚Äôs face was like ‚Äúdamn kid, act like you‚Äôve been there before‚Äù
Next year
maybe if we put them together Voltron-style, we can make one big rocket

Damn I want space babes
Bears r dumb n scared
I don‚Äôt see the dip that everyone else is seeing. I look at NET and UPST and think theres still a lot more room for downside. Recovery should be priced in by now.
Ah yes sell low; buy high
Jeff Bezos opening champagne and laughing like a goddamn villain.

Yeah, time should be about 12 - see how high it goes from there and ride it until 1 to see how low it goes. This has been the main pattern.
No effect on market conditions
Yep you should go short it and do your part. Apple to zero!!
The spy looks so strange, it‚Äôs definitely consolidating along the 430-32 line for a big move in the next couple days
plus that stadium
$SKLZ is squeezing shorts by the balls rn
True it‚Äôs just crazy how much of a difference timing my buy would‚Äôve given me % wise. It would‚Äôve been a crazy win for me at least
Not what I'm talking about. They're cutting off credit and have stopped lending as much. Nothing to do with earnings and more to do with how they think things will play out. They stopped lending because they think people will start defaulting.
How high can it go? I won't be worried until its over 36
Who the fuck thought NET would surged 42% off its lows two weeks ago?  Jesus christ.  Wish I had dumped everything I had into it.
SDC will do it, i saw it in my dreams
Told you ba puts free money
im in the "buy the dip" camp for now as well, tapering is still QE, even if they drop it to 100 bil a month, thats still a lot of QE, i think its too early to bail right now but i could be wrong

QE is still gonna be with us for another 8 months at least so id be surprised if we continue dropping
So 2020.

banks always tank after earnings, and then analysts try to pretend there was a reason for the dump. it's just a pump and dump, don't read too much into it.

Guys remember to be careful in this market.
#September INFLATION up 5.4%  from last year, prob nothing. Fastest pace since 70s.
You need them to fall?
The FOMC minutes should just be literally a full and unedited audio recording of the meeting. That would quickly become my favorite podcast.
Bears that have no business trading. Let the China racists kill themselves off its natural selection at work
FUBO pounding. I knew ATM leaps below 25 would print.
legalize post-birth abortions
Only netted 70% on 0dte puts kept watching 435.10 and didn‚Äôt have the balls to buy 433p fuck me
Buy puts instead when you think it's going for a run, you time the top really well so can't go tits up.
Man up or down i don't care but market needs to make a move!!!!
I'm a bull too but bears are clearly winning this thing.
All the banks pulled in their lending in the last quarter, particularly in the last few weeks. They know this is about to get ugly

"JPMorgan‚Äôs Record M&amp;A Quarter Overshadowed by Muted Loan Growth - The bank's shares fell as consumer and commercial loan growth remained challenged." Bloomberg
october is the slowest work month
I decided to give some puts at try after that first drop today and got wrecked for 1.5k. Good on ya, best of luck on that F rocket!

At least I'm in FUBO leaps, they're floating me today.
Why buy at the top of one thing when you can buy top of all the shit stocks

Penn rejected off the top of the wedge, when it finally breaks out past 75.65ish we're in business
You're welcome I bought puts last week
I have the perfect investment strategy. Rather than baghold whatever is promoted on wallstreetbets, you buy puts and share of whatever is promoted on wallstreetbets. If it moons, you cry about not buying calls. If it dumps, you cash on the puts, and you go back to baghold as you would have done in the first place.
Right when they hit apogee
def don't sell. can't predict the future but if you can't hold through something like this you're never gonna see a profit. November-december is usually fire for apple.
15mph landing probably hurts
How much do you think the person cleaning all the shit and piss in that rocket gets paid?
Nikola still has over a billion market cap, of course this shit is the biggest bubble in history. No other logical way to put it.

One time I built an electric bike, then I was in the middle of building another electric bike when the first one exploded in my garage and almost burned down my house. I have over a thousand in bike parts for a project I'm probably never gonna finish. Or the time I built a race drone and couldn't figure out how to fly it, and it flew away. One time I bought an old porsche 924 that barley ran as my daily driver. My whole life is full of failures, with a few success stories sprinkled in there. It's been a lot of fun.
Every time I buy a stock that looks like its going up I instead buy it at its peak and it just plummets after.

Kinda interesting, during the Crusades the Christians who stayed in Jerusalem (when they held the city) would start to trade with the nearby Muslim populations, and eventually the interest in trade would outweigh religious tensions and things would cool off for the most part. Then when new Christian pilgrims from Europe would show up all gung ho about the cause, the Christians who lived there would have to take them aside and be like, ‚Äòyo, cool it with that shit you‚Äôre fucking up our money‚Äô lol

The reason why I can‚Äôt is because if I did I would be broke myself and can‚Äôt afford food. The difference with rich people is they can easily afford it and they won‚Äôt be going starving like I would. You care if rich get their extra yacht instead of the lives in innocent people?

You're still doing communism, regardless! You're taking money from people for your own use! The amount of money you take (steal) and the purpose for which you use it doesn't somehow make it not communism anymore.

You have this belief that anyone has any idea who deserves what at any time. That's not your call to make nor any politician's. Instead of robbing rich people, why don't you use your *own* money and help the people you supposedly care so much about? Why can't you make the noble sacrifices and fund other people's healthcare?

Powell isn‚Äôt going to start tapering until unemployment is down, he gives zero fucks. His position is very clear and the only thing that will get him to change his mind is to bully him like orange man did.
No.  

Open the position by selling a cash secured put. If it ends ITM, you're buying shares at the price you picked (minus premium). If it ends OTM, you keep the premium, rinse and repeat.  

Once you're assigned, do it again except this time with CC's.  

Then bend over and be ready to be gaped when the stock moves violently against you and your $35 in premium doesn't cover the massive loss you take on the underlying

Anyone playing TSM earnings?
Just picked up some cheap CLF calls for post earnings. Earnings Oct22nd... calls in the $26-$30 range are cheap for Oct29th. Should see a pre-earnings raise.
$net 170 eow
Lucid called them in. Basically, each company has the option to call the warrants in for 1 cent a piece if their common shares reach and maintain a certain price for a certain amount of time. Afaict, it's typically around $18 for 60-90 days. At that point, they can be like "shit or get off the pot" for the warrants. The kicker here is they even offered a cashless exercise (about 0.44 common shares per warrant, iirc), but if I wanted to do that, I had to call fidelity and tell them... Otherwise the default is $0.01 per warrant, üò≠

It works but the 2 outcomes are:

1. You hold for 3 months and make a relatively small amount of money to the money you're tying up
2. The stock goes down and you're stuck with it, selling OTM calls for years just trying to break even
thats racist

Its a play to take advantage of high volatility on maybe a stock that you don‚Äôt want to hold long term. Wouldn‚Äôt do it across the board. 

Got to consider taxes and, like you said, losing out on high growth when the shares get called away.
How many bearish positions do you have loaded?
I'm going to be honest. You have *no idea* what you're talking about.

If you took Jeff Bezos's whole net worth alone and equally divided among everybody in our nation, everyone would only get $586. Yes. 586 dollars. Even if we adjust for children and babies and old people, that's no higher than $1000.

And that assumes nobody responsible for moving the "Wealth" around takes any of it, which they absolutely will. Idk what world it is you think you live in, but it's not reality.

Is it a normal strategy to buy 100 shares, sell covered calls ATM 45 days out, collect the largest premium, and even if the strike point is reached, you made the premium and got your money back? (Yes you could loose out on future growth, but you got the fat premium and made your original purchase back?)

Inflation go brrrrr ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
if the fed chooses to print rather than taper then that will be beneficial to the job market, which in turn will be beneficial to inflation.

tapering is essentially definite recession, further stimulus is at least an attempt at prevention
Ya know Stops have saved me from a lot of pain with weekly options but boy does it sting when shit like a quick drop on SKLZ triggers my stop followed by massive hulk dick that woulda put them up 100%. Probably didn‚Äôt need to play it quite so safe with the trailing stop. üòê

GME is entering a wedge pattern that will hit a precipice at 175 at which point it will either breakout to the upside or the downside.  This happened at the end of a handle and cup pattern so that's bullish but the overall market is bearish so this could be exciting.

and people wonder why were tanking? how about not pushing stocks up 100% in a year during a recession and then ignoring some of the highest inflation weve ever seen
Me too. Earnings is a crapshoot from my experience. Maybe the drop was in response to some news today? Too busy to check but should be interesting either way

I thought it'd be red, but when I looked PM and then around open, was like wow good thing I was wrong.  Nope, right again.  Fuck me.

Still green all over.  Go home bears.
I swear to god if I hear one more of you boomer fucks mention some stupid chart astrology pattern shit
I agree, but I am getting anxious for it. This economy is absolutely fucked by supply side issues and I don't see how low rates are helping anyone except people who own assets at the expense of people who don't own a lot of assets. No one wants to buy houses, no one wants to buy stocks, no one wants to buy goods because everything is so pricy. Just crash this bitch so people can start on more equal footing from a clean slate.

 a quick 2-3% correction which were subsequently bought. However, the   
buy the dip mentality has been replaced by sell the pops. Traders are   
quick to sell the rallies and so far the market has corrected about 5%.   
There is no conviction in the market at this time. Also have Seasonality  
 factor:  the market is down historically during this time of year  
(September / October). With all the option dealers large Vega exposure,   
the  market could experience a Volatility Shock similar to that of Feb   
2018 when a Vix ETF blew up. [https://youtube.com/watch?v=IIDbpDywO7w&amp;feature=share](https://youtube.com/watch?v=IIDbpDywO7w&amp;feature=share)  
 According to Vega exposure data, option dealers have a large exposure   
and a volatility spike, with SPX breaking 4250 quickly, -- would cause   
them to cover. Remember, volatility increases during option expiry week.  
 If the market corrects more from here, it would be a great buying   
opportunity.

1. How does limiting rich people help poor people??
2. You can't control what politicians do.

You're still making no sense. Rich people are the ones creating the jobs. What if instead of entrusting money to a bunch of people you know nothing about, that lie to you in a daily basis, you simply let people decide what they want to do with their own money and sought to get your *own* amount of money to help people instead? This whole idea is based around trying to force *everyone else* to do something instead of figuring out how to do it *yourself*.

I think a crash would be good for us. Would clear out a lot of gurus, apes, butt coin miners, zombie companies etc. and it will make a future crash less painful. The economy is a cycle of creation and destruction, but the Fed and Gov prevented destruction for 2 years. Time to clear out the riff raff.
You get fired, then blacklisted from the entire industry, then while going out of their way to ruin your life your former boss just snaps, kidnaps your whole family and tortures them to death over a long period of time, the stress of which causes you to be fired from your next job, then blacklisted from the new industry, then the new ex-boss also snaps and works together with the old one to destroy the entire earth

Perhaps the juiciest jenga piece of the apocalyptic deck stacked against us is the meta-delusion: the belief of an individual that being delusional is a good idea, typically expressed in the form of perceived *strength*, thinking one needs delusion in order to be mentally strong enough or it makes them stronger than others. It is not the biggest problem in the world, but if it could be solved, it may cause the bigger interconnected complex of problems to collapse without the vital structural support provided by this paradox reinforcing the delusions of billions of humans.

It doesn't matter how a situation was created. Your ideas make no sense. You somehow believe taking money from a group of rich people who earned it and moving it all into the hands of politicians who produce nothing and don't understand individual situations somehow makes sense.

Bulls don‚Äôt worry y‚Äôall getting embarrassed on here every day for the last few weeks couldn‚Äôt happen to a more deserving group of gullible degenerates. Just because you made money in the last year while the market was on easy mode doesn‚Äôt mean you are smart or a good investor. Now get wrecked
How many bull traps do you need to get caught in before you recognize the current market trends?
Bank earnings were good but I guess they didn't like the outlooks or something?  Financial sector is pretty red.  Not one of my investments so I don't care much but I'm always curious how this stuff works.

seriously, holy shit - i should have trusted my gut, once that opening green run petered out i knew this was coming, as it does every day
Yea same, I knew it'll drop some more but just wanted to lock in profit
wow precious metals WILDIN today
I know they are volatile, also I know that's why they are not included in core cpi. The point I'm making though is if inflation were to be increasing it would be hard to reflect since it would also be volatile, therefore convenient if you didn't want to report the extent of high inflation.
Piece of fucking dogshit stock

Is there much of a risk of cutting yourself trimming your dick with hair trimmers without a guard?

Asking for myself. Trying to figure out how careful I should be
they're volatile when decreasing too what are you talking about

the price volatility of those products doesn't really impact demand though so they're not included in the core cpi since they don't really have much of an effect

I want you to regret annoying me. I know sitting here being dishonest in a conversation with me and showing off how hard you can bullshit just to annoy me makes you feel better about your delusions. It's your idea of trolling, even though you're too mentally ill to control what you're doing like a proper self-aware troll could. I know being able to annoy someone who isn't delusional makes you feel powerful. It feeds your meta delusion, the belief that being delusional makes you stronger than a working brain could ever be, and this belief shields you from the pain of putting effort into life. I hope since you chose me as the smart person to annoy to make yourself feel like the big bad boy who can annoy smart people, this backfires on you and you're just stuck in a psychological loop torturing yourself more than any enjoyment you get out of it can be worth. Suck my dick, you wannabe nerd.

The price controls doomed the empire. Predictably everyone fled the industries that were no longer profitable, and he ‚Äúfixed‚Äù it by requiring all children to pursue the professions of their parents.

This led to permanently impoverished hereditary classes, and widespread resentment of imperial authority. Over time, people only were loyal to local landlords who protected them from predatory taxation.

You mean the guy that breathed another 2 centuries of life into a dying empire? Fair, nothing has changed in the last 2 millennia about economics or governments so probably best to cherry pick parts or his reign as the basis for modern economic theory.
Seems like it was about the same as last month,  and about what was expected.  AKA, PRICED IN!! BRRRRBbrbrbrBrbrb
obviously. tanks immediately during AH (when volume is low) on old news? hate to be a conspiracy theorist but that reeks of manipulation.

Are they literally going to let them starve in them homes, or freeze, etc?

Not saying it is right, but what do you expect them to do in this situation.
In theory the market value of homes will fall if interest rates rise, in the inverse of what they did the past 18 months.  So the owner would be sitting on paper loss if they bought recently.

Big picture: The big surge in inflation this year is likely to last well into 2022 -- an outcome the Federal Reserve has only recently acknowledged.

Broad shortages of labor and supplies are raising costs for companies and they are charging higher prices to maintain their profits. These shortages in some cases have gotten worse and there's little end in sight.

The ongoing bottlenecks have forced the Fed to reconsider its view that inflation was "transitory" and would fade by the end of the year.

I don't think you understand the forces that are contributing to your local situation. üá®üá≥ Ships enough fentanyl to the US to kill every single citizen in the country. Cartels pump heroin and meth into CA with impunity. Those drugs end up in towns like yours. It's a national crisis.

Idk man I've had some stressful time and lost thousands on individuals theta gang trades. Seems like easy money but when you get hit you can get hit hard.

I don't get why you feel the need to do mental gymnastics about this. They cracked down harder on weed than opiates in that region so people would traffick more opiates to the local population instead of weed. It's well known among the local population. Pretty much every other locale in the United States have had police doing the opposite for years, cracking down much harder on opiates than weed so that people prefer trafficking in weed instead of opiates. It's a matter of whether the police want to kill taxpayers so big pharma can get extra kickbacks, or not kill taxpayers and let that money go to small farmers instead of big pharma. You know what I don't even know why I'm explaining this to you as if you care about right and wrong, just suck my dick you delusional fucking disingenuous nerd

Still not enough trucks to transport those containers. 
100% progress though so can‚Äôt complain
like the people rooting for unemployment and a deadly virus for the last 18 months so there would be asset inflation?
Was the data bad ? Pump or dump
Nah. We rocket to 500 after this small direction. Then we crash second half 2022. And it will last a hell of a lot longer than 6 months
Oh thanks it's been at least 6 seconds from your last post about it, I was craving an update.

We've been in a bear market for the past 2 weeks.
Inversed if you're looking at premium price
It's only burning away the excess valuation created by reckless speculating perma-bulls.
What taper?
Cats driving cars. Dogs flying planes. You can‚Äôt make this shit up.
Looks like all you retards that bought SPY calls expiring this week are fucked.
Have you learned anything from the experience?
No, that's not how this goes. High CPI is a positive for tapering now and increasing rates asap, not the opposite. Get your puts ready.
Making a financial decision based on impending doom does not mean you wanted the impending doom to happen.
All options buyers. Join theta gang to make money.
Okay gay bull
Lmao found Jerome‚Äôs Reddit account.

Real, and spectacular.
it is way worse than actual numbers. everyone knows that.
Make a bolder bet, that target is too close.
Gross.
I liked it better at 326 a few minutes ago
Bye money bye
The worse inflation gets the more the markets expect the Fed to "use its tools to fight it" aka taper/raise rates.

Of course it wont happen, but its just a knee jerk reaction. Eventually ATH's will come again this year.
Short TLT?
imagine thinking a healthy 15% correction is the equivalent of the world burning. braindead bulls

Fire Jpow and get someone like Warren in there. Turn those printers back on!

I don't think so, it's probably an exponential function of sorts with respect to time.

Oh looks like WSB is pretty üåà this morning with all the bears here. Soooo‚Ä¶.anyone wanna play üåà superhero‚Äôs with me then? I‚Äôll let you play with my new woke PC superüÖ±Ô∏èUssy action figure‚Ä¶.
So Gold drops if inflation is higher than expected because the FED will be more hawkish and gold drops if inflation is lower than expected because the inflation-hedge-safety-trade is less proeminent.

Love the logic.
If it makes the bulls feel better I am closing my shorts and moving into credit spreads at open
CNBC is really shilling this Cramer bagholder club

Is he still holding Bear Stearns?
How much you want to bet the market is going to fake pump at open just to trap these permabulls lol

They would never admit that and further risk JPow second term
Edit: Boomalotti deleted all his comments including his ban bet, so maybe he is forgotten.
just look at headline inflation instead it includes energy and food
Numbers were definitely bad since the market direction has been controlled by the Fed since 2008
You made a really short custom ban bet (None) which was not accepted.

Higher rates generally just means less borrowing, less capital expenditure, less spending, etc. It slows things down.

This more or less matches my experience tbh
I have been in an out of it all year and finally just staying in.
I don't know if the market will ever love it but the Ford buyers are the sharps of EV investing.
For who? High CPI means the market will react with higher interest rates which could be bearish for the market.
rents accelerating which isn't an indicator i would consider transitory, but considering rent growth is still below pre-pandemic rates i still see zero indication that current inflation is not necessarily transitory
That's the part that scares me
Inflation makes them taper sooner
Not alot of pigeons where I'm at.. lots of Blue Jays tho. Those good?
Puts printing already!!

Higher than expected. Yields are rising which is arguably a bearish sign for the market. It depends on how the bond market reacts rest of the day. It could level out and be a nothingburger but of course I‚Äôm holding weekly puts so market will prolly moon ü§°
I mean, at least SPY gives a low effort attempt to test the 50 before dumping.
How would tapering and increasing rates make food prices go down?
High CPI = quicker taper

Expecting a small comeback throughout 1st half, followed by a slight downturn continuing the negative trend before close.

Inflation literally by definition just means a general increase in the price level. The definition has nothing directly to do with value of dollar, money supply, supply issues, interest rates etc. 

It still matters cause supply side inflation can lead to spiraling inflation down the line when everyone needs raises or starts to hoard goods. The inflation that Paul Volcker needed 20% rates to calm down started with cost-push inflation.

Being cynical you wonder why is the government going to release high inflation number. It‚Äôs a totally made up number anyway, and it‚Äôs made up by them. It excludes ‚Äúvolatile‚Äù items like energy, food and autos. I predict a perfectly made up goldilocks number.

So today inflation isn‚Äôt going to be so unexpectedly low that the tapering can is actually kicked down the road. But if really high will it lock tapering in to November and cause much pearl clutching and gnashing of teeth. Market will probably rally some though if the number is not insane. Interesting that the market is positioned for good news. Things will get turbulent if it‚Äôs bad news.

Inflation data is at 8:30 a.m. The U.S. sells $24 billion of 30-year bonds at 1:00 p.m. The minutes from the September Fed meeting are released at 2:00 p.m. G-20 finance ministers and central bank heads meet in Washington. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles‚Äôs term as Wall Street‚Äôs main watchdog expires today. OPEC publishes its monthly outlook. As well as JPMorgan we also get results from BlackRock Inc. and Delta Airlines Inc. today.
you're probably right bro, you're probably right
Yolo I‚Äôm assuming
When you actually live in winter you find out the cold doesn't make you cold, it just makes you lazy. At first if you really hate getting cold you'll be scared of going out in the winter and every time you do go out you'll put on your ski mask and your electric scarf and electric gloves and chemical heat packs in the liner of your jacket. Then you won't be cold at all while you're outside, you'll just be annoyed it's hard to use the touch screen on your phone or whatever. Next time you want to go outside, you'll be like "ugh I don't feel like checking if the batteries in my scarf are dead and tying my boots right now, I'll do it later." When it finally is time to go outside and not put it off for later you'll be like "eh I'm just gonna be shoveling for 5 minutes, I can skip the scarf, probably don't actually have to tie the boots either tbh." And eventually you figure out the ideal balance for yourself on how much you want to go outside, how much effort you want to put into preparing for the cold each time you get dressed to go outside, how much you want to just endure some cold air to save some time every time you get dressed. No matter what balance you land on, you will find that it solves the cold issue well enough for you because that is simply what your brain has evolved to do, but it doesn't solve the limited number of hours in a day - so like I said, the issue with winter doesn't end up being that you're gonna be cold for a few months, it's that going outside is gonna take a little more effort and time investment and that'll make you kinda lazy for a few months.

I do still hear old people bitch about the cold as if it's actually the cold that bothers them, but I swear they're just bitching for the sake of bitching. It's like Brits complaining about it being cloudy all the time. It's not their real concern, it's just a humanly understandable cultural way of using words about it. The exception with Brits is people with seasonal depression desperate to see some sunlight, for those people "it's bloody grim outside" actually means "it's bloody grim outside." The exception with Maine winters is people who work outside or commute on foot, having to spend longer times outside than little batteries or a little insulation can help with, for those people "I'm fucking cold" actually means "I'm fucking cold" and that is their actual concern during winter but they wouldn't be spending all that time outside in the cold if they were the kind of person that can't handle it

Inflation data is at 8:30 a.m. The U.S. sells $24 billion of 30-year bonds at 1:00 p.m. The minutes from the September Fed meeting are released at 2:00 p.m. G-20 finance ministers and central bank heads meet in Washington.

Well you are cutting losing positions, so not horrible I guess. You gotta consider the opportunity cost.

You could sell covered calls to lower you cost basis and wait it out though. Depends what % of your buying power is tied up in it
Loss or gain ?
I won't but I will tell you between profit/loss of those trades I was up 500.  But I had so much capital tied up in those trades I lost two months.  I still kick myself for getting greedy.
Either down to 4 or up to 7. Or anything inbetween.
I never said anything on taking positions specially a short lol

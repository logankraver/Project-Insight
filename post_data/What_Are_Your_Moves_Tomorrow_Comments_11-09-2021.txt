NVDA 350 today
uranium calls like nagasaki
2k in cash money. Debating on my choices
NVDA just cannot be stopped
congrts to LAZR call holders..i wasnt that lucky so i made some $$$ premkt scalping 500 LAZR shares from $22 to $28.66
3k&gt;50k and counting biggest fcking cum back of my life
Bought luminar at 41$ 69% premarket jump is nothing
It's already open though.
They parted ways in 2015, I believe.
so glad i held my itm amd and nvda calls through the night!
There's that. Might get the crayon eaters to jump in.

i dont know. im buying amd at open fuck it
You underestimating cult stock, you need to throw common sense when you thinking about TESLA
Maybe we should start our own poll "Will Elon REALLY sell 10% if his Tesla"
That's when I bought in so yessss 🤞🤞
Both if you can but NVDA has just been ripping and earnings coming up next week I think 17?
Ready or not, here I cum. You can't hide.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
so Double D in zero Gs?
Broke ass company
Wtf why is LUV dropping?
NVDA just destroyed that.  Read the news and that's why it's pumping again.
jensen for president. i knew nvda was a good buy.
Gonna need more than that in a few years
He just wanted to make comment on the senator's small pee pee. That's all.
Because they were assholes I guess. He told his new wife I had advised against marrying her as part of original break up - then when they got married I was the elephant in the room. Marriage / gfs can really change people
AMD or NVDA to save me from myself?
Congrats to whoevers holding one of those 20 LAZR 22cs
Babahaha. You got me there! I was tripping he'd be allowed back on Twitter!
NVDA partnership and earnings today
Can my Jan PLTR calls finally turn green today🙏
FIST IN ASS NO FEAR!!! SPY PUTS
Lol, yeah, that would be OPs account

WTFFF LAZR
By open
Holy shit there are 11 million people in here? Mods gotta make this their full time job now ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Does he creep on us here? We know what you're doing Musk! Go away!
We’re doing that again?
As in BUY NOW or wait ?
Let's shoot $AMD to $170
Nice DDD DD, I'm so fkn in
Is Uranium still a thing?
Agreed 👍
He's the CEO and therefore isn't able to sell a shit ton of shares all in one go. It gets sold off in blocks gradually at pre-determined prices.

And at this point the news of his sell has already broken, everyone now expects this sale, so when he actually does it noone will be surpised.

Probably the reason he tweeted this on Friday, to allow people to digest the information over the weekend instead of panic selling the following morning before they've even looked into it.
Market will move to the right at open, Bear are fuk!
CCJ $50 by Thanksgiving.
wtf LAZR?
Add:

/u/Legatron4 (1/0) made a bet that NVDA would go to 320.0 when it was 294.97 and it did, congrats you fuckin nerd.
BNTX go brrrr after earnings
I'd like to know, too! Didn't eBay own Paypal?

Friend of mine uses them. Says the banking is good and the trading needs work
Compared to Nvidia everything is undervalued, except TSLA

/u/GolfMan1776 (1/1) made a bet that NVDA would go to 320.0 when it was 309.6 and it did, congrats you fuckin nerd.
DDD dropped after a double beat and zero debt. They are the leader in selling 3D printers and the only company in the space making profit. If I turned down the chance at some triple D's, I'd be a very 🌈🐻
I'm bearish on Ford. It's high right now after the run up day yesterday.
shh, be patient it will blossom into a massive 4 day green dildo fest
&gt; You have a casino?
God damn it. Why did I wake up and check my portfolio? Can’t go back to sleep now. Let’s get the damn casino open.
PLTR earnings today, so i guess today it is going to be a really good,green day
Will be in the 1300s EOW and your dick knows it
It has gone parabolic and the RSI is at fucking 87
Lmao

Fun fact: ducks have a penis in the shape of a cork screw…….
And where can I buy those floral face masks?
Ford calls are working pretty well these days.   $17k I invested last Weds-Fri worth $29k this morning ... and i didn't time buys very well at all.
Nancy Pelosi is killing it with her picks
Depends on the sauce,  also.  I like a heavy dog sauce with lots of garlic.
Regards.
AMD could double up to 300 and I'd still think it's undervalued comparative to NVDA
Lets wait and see TSLA when Elon will sell
Man there are so many generational buying and generational bagholding opportunities in the market it’s crazy to see these parallels with such deep values and such bubbles all in the same market. It’s amazing, america tried a pathetic attempt at some insecure ego trip stock war with gYnA that did nothing to hurt them as gyna laughed if off, and now it’s about the blow up in the American middle classes face like it always does. Die well regards, I’m enjoying the show.
If CDNA2 had CFloat8/16 AMD would totally murder.  Oh well.  Maybe CDNA3 will.
Your mothers cock is bigger then yours!
&gt; That's a good idea.
Imagine being a 🌈🐻in the biggest bull market of all time
Maybe some pltr calls first thing on the chance it rips from earnings?
Holding nvda, amd, coin call 🤾🏿‍♀️
&gt; I would sell at open.
I have RBLX 12/3 90 calls.  Do I sell at open or let it grind higher for the next 3 weeks?
Hahaha omg
Sold my NVDA 330 call for a loss yesterday morning, went all in on MSFT.

Fuck my whole life.
AMD and Nvidia slowed down. Calm before the storm ?
He posted about it just before https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump

Hopefully it’ll move today

NVDA- Anyone concerned about the gap up premarket?
Go back to bed, Dr. Burry
LAZR up 60%…


Fuuuhhhhk
Fuck off? How about we fuck on!!
MVIS up almost 6% in PM
Watch the keynote. They're pretty much going to take over the AI space. Literally take it over.

Bist du doof?
Yes
NVDA going brrrrr 🚀🚀🚀
Naw, and I doubt he will, but you'd never know with that guy.
NVDA premarket stronk AF LFG
I think NVDA fair value is prolly like 150 but I’d nibble at 175
Got 11 nvda shares last week lfg!!!!!
You know it's up over 1% pm right?
A flood of bullish news for NVDA already this AM. They are making improvements in everything form EVs to healthcare and fighting forest fires (…random, but true). 

11/19 280c keep doing your thing.
Since Kimbal Musk sold a lot of shares on Friday (one day before Elon sell tweet), it was obvious this shit stock is going to tank so hard.
yep. Roblox poppin'.
What doesn’t kill ya makes ya stronger, stand a little taller….. 💃🕺💃
I'm not getting any Only Fans ads. The ads are catered to each individual account's activity..
Jesus lazr stop and let the rest of us retards on the short bus before you fly off to Neptune.
She's crazy undervalued next to nvda. If she doubled to 300 I'd call that fair value
Oh shit. PLTR is ripping. Earnings come out at 8am this morning?
I mean i dont want much pre drop Levels would bee fine
&gt; I am not aware of any specific date.
NVDA would have to get down to a few thousand dollars in total market cap to not be overpriced to me
Has a set a date yet or just gaining more attention?
Lucid and hertz 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)
Yep got you. It’s fully posted on their Twitter account - gonna watch the entire thing at work. Why not get paid to do so? Lol
Grab nvda/amd/coin calls and shares whatever da fck u can and just hold. Fck everything else like SDC or Wish garbage chuck that shit out and get on the real dealz lmao
No you found the only guy who makes money here
I think we're wired to not make money due to fear. I sold 450 shares of a company last week because it was tanking, and now it's up over 20% since then  smfh.
Lost money by SPY call yesterday😭😭

That’s not even the issue it’s the fact that their stock is crazy overpriced meanwhile the most important semi company of them all TSM is undervalued by quite a lot
Guess I'll be twistin up some erbs and sippin on some OE, banging 36 chambers
*"so the audience is a bunch of hoes?.."*
If we rally for the rest of the year it will definitely be a blow-off top
Elon unloading his shares is still pending
Grab them by pussy
That being said, I'm holding.

The Meta contract with AMD isn't good for NVIDIA. I don't know what they'll announce today but it'd better be good.
I believe that will be a rebroadcast.

Does this feel like peak euphoria yet? Definitely not.
You're out of line buster!
Fuck I hope not. She already face ripped yesterday. How much more can she go?
And why would you buy AMD puts? Like what’s the catalyst for that? Like I could understand why some people buy puts for TSLA, but AMD? Isn’t that kinda irrational.
Ford calls or spy calls???
Yeah. Been disappointing since the initial drop few weeks ago.
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Zuropia (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1001.0 when it was 1149.41 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

This is the future, anyone ever should take the 2 hours it takes to watch the keynote. Our future is very bright.

It is what it is, I wouldnt do anything else. I was destined for this whether i win or lose.
Welcome to the stock market, where the futures don't matter and the numbers are made up!
If $TSLA finishes above 1140 on friday. I will have NEVER...never in 2 years lost money on $TSLA EVER.

Its 1180 bid/ask right now.

Just freaking amazing that 1200 is 6000 presplit and I used to think 1370 presplit was pricey.

Hi /u/ElonMuskOfficial thanks for helping get closer to retirement.
Perfect climate for reptiles there.

RIP to anyone who bought TSLA puts yesterday.

You should know this buy now: Don't bet against papa Elon.
i heard big funds hate sofi, so it must be good.
Well RIP my AMD puts

Should be about -1600 at open today. Ugh. Not a big deal, but annoying
I thank you for selling me that.

So AMD calls at open?? 160C NOV 19. Is my play here guys!
7 times of 10 gme ends fridays at max pain. but last few times there above so it must be time to finish at max pain.
Ah. I’m wondering more short term. I’m short 80 ES contracts and starting to sweat
Do you always copy and paste all your comments through different subs?
Gimme some of those max pain tickers rn, I'm trying to off load here 🥵
Well, for the sake of both of us, I beg Papa Buffett to make sure SPY doesn’t decline. Currently holding onto META calls that have netted me a decent amount so Im most likely going to sell today. Also recently added on a few more QSR calls that expire next year (2023). Up 29.92% on these (but since this stock trades in such low volume, it’s very volatile). Just two days ago (for QSR), my equity dropped to 1 cent before skyrocketing back up. Looking into puts for PFE since it’s recently been discovered in a study (and by recently I mean 7 hours ago) that the doses dropped by half in efficiency after a span of only a few months. They do have the pills already rolling out tho, so I predict the excitement of those pills will drive the price up to ~50 before I can pull a retard maneuver.
You're so silly PYPL.

Look at what NVDA is doing. Don't you want to be just like NVDA?

Still lots of good tickers on here.  LEV, REAL, HSC, MQ… these are all WSB discoveries that have printed for me in the last month.

While Elon is focusing on taking billionaires to Mars (and maybe slaves), NVDA will build a giant datacenter for the sole purpose of solving climate change and saving life on earth. They call the datacenter "Earth 2". It will be by far the most accurate simulation of earth ever.
Every dip gets bought up immediately especially  after a stupid Elon tweet, never hold puts over night and take profits asap if you wanna play the sell off

Had zero interest in SDC but having seen the earnings.... show me the loss porn goddammit
GME is definitely top 5, why you always seniority GME
r/sounding is where I see all the best tips.
The money’s gotta go somewhere
They have to up the rates. That’s their only option but the country is so fragile right now they can’t afford it. The FED is stuck between a rock and a hard place.
SDC earnings were rubbish but they'll recover.

You'll eat crow on that in 24 hours. Gme options are the biggest gainers when the stock rips. It's the greenest stock of the year and one of the best plays of all time. Gtfo

6k to 60k last week on gme options
I'm still not convinced the valuations won't just end up "making sense" because of horrific inflation.

Either asset crash or horrific inflation highly likely, I just don't know which one. 

At any rate, I feel confident that actual economic conditions for people in this country have already peaked, at least for several years, and are going to get worse.
😥
I'm up 200% on my calls bought last week. That's not bigly?
its so painfully obvious that this sub is for fucking retards. i was pointiing out that op needed to think about stcg and not burn themselves by sticking it all back in

I remember back in the days where you would actually get good Stock tips for future momentum, such as AMD, SHOP and MELI. All of these were here 6 years ago. I still see AMD and now its only TSLA and the same Old shit being pumped. This sub is full of newbs after the GME ordeal.

What’s a bear?
A horse walks into a bar, and the bartender asks him, "why the long face?"

The horse doesn't say anything because it's a horse, but is startled by the laughter of the drunks at the bar around it, injuring several of them. The bartender had only hoped to ease the tension with some humor when he saw some patrons going for the door, but his behavior only made it worse. He should have let them leave. He should have recognized the danger of the situation and cleared some space around the horse. But he was struggling to keep his own composure, and he couldn't recognize the danger of the situation or he too would panic, and so he made a joke out of some random horse that seems to have something wrong with it, around a bar full of drunks who don't seem to know how to react. Now he had bar stools broken, a man on the floor with a broken leg, another with broken ribs, and a full-on rush to the door. In the commotion, the horse runs into the storage room, also injuring itself after knocking over shelving full of wine glasses. 

The bartender, who also owns the bar, doesn't get caught for being drunk on the job that day, but nonetheless, the ensuing lawsuit triggers the death spiral of his business. Financial issues and increased attention from authorities soon lead to the loss of his license and his bar is foreclosed on. 

He nearly gives up on life and ends it, but he never finds the courage. He slips deeper into his alcoholism. Eventually, he hears his old bar is open again with a new name and new ownership. He decides to go for a visit. 

"Why the long face?" asks the horse, who put a down payment on the place with the money from the lawsuit.
If CPI remains stationary or goes down further it would reinforce the hypothesis that inflation in transitory and the market goes on an hyperspace trip.
Can’t argue with that brother

Seriously. I sell my AMD calls Friday for a small gain and then Nvidia for a small gain yesterday.  They both moon the next day.
Was it in the name of research? Then no Cuomo.
investors will pile in these next days. What they showed yesterday is absolute supremacy over intel for the next few years and a super competitive product against nvidia

i'd like to dispel the rumor that anthony fauci was caught jacking off dogs on camera in march of 1999. there is no truth to that vicious, slanderous allegation that doctor anthony fauci is a known animal rapist, responsible for non-consensually jacking off multiple canines in front of a friend's camera so that he himself could jack off to the footage later

there is zero proof that dogtor fauci ever jacked off multiple dogs on camera in march of 1999

ehhh, why is everyone saying AMD is gunna suddenly rocket this week? The news came out yesterday and the stock shot up over 10% lol
That's rough. That PE is nuts too, people will invest in anything at any price.

in such a downer mood. Sold my QCOM calls way too early for $35k less gains. Not making shit during this historic rally and even have a few puts that are bleeding daily. Everything is up like 30-50% somehow and we're probably nearing a plateu or downtrend soon. My portfolio is still in deep red from rebuilding at the top in Feb 2021. I'm watching my high conviction EV infrastructure plays that lost me so much money moon these days. Fuck me
Get ready to buy back those shorts.. if you're quick at open you might not get totally wrekt, she's mooning to 200 today

F to $100.00
Thanks brother
It doesn’t bother me since I clearly see the risk/reward trade off. Selling spreads always gives me the opportunity to roll to a further date if things are going south currently but you don’t really get that ability with pure calls. That itself just doesn’t make the risk on pure calls worth it when this my entire life savings. The consistent gains with thetagang when compounded definitely beat most wsb returns. I only had about 250k in June of last year.

The union is just icing on the cake. If you don’t hustle in this line of work, you’re fired. They can’t help you. Other companies call me for extra work because I hustle. I don’t fuck around.

That's actually not my issue. I left out the fact that something is wrong with my digestive system in general whether I smoke weed or not. Exact problem is unknown but likely related to fatty liver so shouldn't be a problem anymore after weight loss. But these days it's only really an issue for me with the way it interacts with weed, hence my initial comment not mentioning the fatty liver thing, especially since I think my weed habit contributed to my level of overeating leading to fatty liver so it's all interconnected.

SOFI is the best play IMO. They report on the 10th and they are waiting on a banking charter approval and they are growing at greater than 100% YOY. Oh yeah, and they are still cheap!
It sucks - it’s morally the right thing to do though. my best friend asked me for advice as he was unsure and I told him the truth and they called off the wedding… then it was back on a few months later and I lost my best buddy and was viewed as Satan by my everyone. I lost the whole crew.

I've said it before, but the problem with Ford is that they are completely reliant on the ICE F-150 for their continued existence, their expenses are enormous, their balance sheet sucks, their products suck, and increasing rates and inflation are going to make it near impossible for all the hillbillies to take out a ton of debt to buy trucks they can't really afford anyway.

There are 2 processor designs currently in use, AMD's and ARM's. All processors are based on these and pay licencing fees. Intel does no longer have a design, it licenses from AMD. Apple recently switched from AMD's design (intels implementation) to ARM.

Even though ARM's takeover by NVDA is not approved yet, it is priced partially.

Its an old school way of vaccinating. Pfizer and Moderna used modern methods whereas the protein based vaccines have been around since the 80s and probably everyone that has been vaccinated for other things has already had one before. That's also why there is a hope that this will be better received by vaccine skeptics at how quickly the other vaccines came to market. If you google novavax protein based vaccine you'll see a lot of info on it and news.

Where are you getting the part about no side effects? Did you read the study or just some press release? Because the other vaccines also don't have statically significant side effects, it's just that a few billion people are taking them ar the same time and there's a huge hype around side effects, so half of the people claiming side effects are actually having placebo effect.

I’ve only recently crossed 1M but about 30-50k per month selling put spreads mostly on SPX
Does it have 5G tho?
Still love my TLRY and CGC shares.
5-6 red days totaling a whole 1% drop.
Startups
24 is pretty big bro
None of you know what you’re doing in this market AND IT FOOKIN SHOWS! It Smell like hopium in here.
i think i´ll drop my WISH bags before that shit tanks even more.
I might grab a few more NVAX today. Got in on Friday between 147-152 and up quite a bit so far as it closed @ 173.02  but can feel the gambling part of my brain saying I should go in for more. Their approvals are pending and could come in any time now and I'll kick myself if I don't get more probably as this could really moon.

Then like a chinese fortune cookie this was in the boston herald this morning..... 

A protein-based vaccine platform used for decades to guard against hepatitis and shingles could be a pandemic game changer.

Novavax is preparing to seek approval of their protein-based vaccine for COVID-19. And, in a user-friendly development, it comes with no major side effects.

That means no headaches, fevers, nausea or chills associated with mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer.

I think I know what I'm gonna do when the casino opens even though I've tried to reel in my gambling tendencies...
Aluminum of China

Yeah, pass. Volume on that stock must be super low. Gap city.
It’s the worst.
You’re still early. The transition into quantum computing will take a couple years. Australia will move their public transport system to a quantum setup in 2022. The free land is going to invest in quantum, ionq is a suitable target.
We get it. You’ve never gotten special treatment for having money
That’s how Biotech works. And I’ve been around the block enough times to know that they don’t wait. They get the results. They publish them almost immediately.
Next year we'll have 5-6 red days in total.
I know I am
Oh. How much are you netting each 2 weeks approximately on $1M theta ganging?
Hooooly shit
Depends on the mood, sometimes I want to have sex, sometimes I wanna get fucked, sometimes I wanna fuck someone. I am usually the one making decisions but work is almost always split evenly.
I guess SDC has a new sister company that just IPO’d in the Tele-health industry. A tele-surgery SPAC - ticker DOA - great opportunity! 

You watch a highly qualified surgeon on zoom give you very simple step-by-step instructions on how and where to give yourself the incision. You stick your iPhone camera inside  and get guided from there. Gall bladder removal, kidney stones, appendectomy, open heart surgery - whatever you need, it’s a sinch. And at 1/10th the cost of in-person surgery!

*DOA not liable if patient loses internet or passes out during procedure*
What do you sell?
I wonder how many of us are actually u/zjz
Elon musk lays there if you guys didn’t know hence: the sex robot that does the work

It’s okay if you don’t know the first move just lay there and tell her to get on top of you after making out. Key phrase: just lay there
“you’re delusional. it’s a bust company, lose so much money and barely growing anymore. This company should be valued at 10b”

Well considering I’m a virgin, I just lay there looking up at the sky wondering if I’ll die a virgin
Lol you don’t know me. Never been with a girl with a BMI over 25. I can’t even get it up if there’s belly
Or likes fucking fat bitches that just lay there… someone not both has to put in work
They are stupid
Under Sandwiches. Should have put quesadillas too
Just woke up. Time to get money.
You probably enjoy that though
Her pussy has to smell really good for me to eat it but i have her sit on my face. So i still lay there
Yeah a lot of things overbought, I make a few watchlists for what might go up and down, normally it's almost an even split and right now it's 55-1

Definitely, just grab her ass the next time she hugs you and rub your hard dick against her abdomen, she’ll definitely give you a footjob during thanksgiving if you sit across from her or a handy if you sit beside her, cousins fiancé’s are the most dickable people at pretty much any family get together.
I guess some parts were a little slow, but overall, the acting was good and the story is creative (yes, I know it’s a remake)

Wow this is such a good pic. Which phone camera did you use??
I think people have just become stupid and complacent. technology is a crutch and it’s making people weaker and will with 100% certainty eventually either bite them in the ass or worse be their downfall. We have whores cataloging themselves for rich assholes on Instagram and we have ravaging depraved Simps giving them attention. This world is sick, it’s rotten, but all I can do is continue hunting the ones responsible for it. It’s up to everyone to decide who they want to be and what they want the world to be like. Stop paying attention to the bullshit because it’s not going away anytime soon, focus on how you plan to shape the world and do it.

A quick search on their site might answer your question
Nah. Same industry. I work at a union company, but sometimes other non union companies need help, so I pick up shifts for cash money. The cash rate is good, so I can’t say no. Extra $1500-$1800 per week non union on top of my union check, so I deal with it for a week or so. It’s not all the time, so I just hustle when it’s available. The winter is usually slow for my business and where I’m at on the list, so I stack money and travel during the winter. Catch me snowboarding or in some random country during the week while everyone else is working. I love it.
Is it going to involve cyborgs in any capacity?

Dude what the fuck, multiple jobs or you a lawyer or some shit?
our of the thousands of shit comments on reddit, I occasionally find a comment that makes me laugh. Congratulations
When you say valuations are you talking about P/E ratio?
Zoom out to YTD , now imagine being a bagholder and suddenly there is a 8% gains before earnings.
When's it listing?
I used to at first. Now Im lazy af. but sometimes waking up at 8am and checking the markets has saved me from buying at open before the dip is done LOL
They hold their plays for awhile tho. Well at least Nancy does lol
It’s hard to say, everything in PYPL’s earning look fine but the guidance and a little bit of revenue. Then again the same could be said about fb and Amzn, which now look pretty fine rn. Then again they are the FAANG and PayPal is PayPal.

I’m 99% calls 😎
I'm always like "equity valuations can stay levitated for years with zero interest rates, no reason to pull out yet." then I look at 20 charts in a row that are all like "X is in the 99th percentile of the historical range, the last times this value was observed for this metric were Oct 08 and Mar 00." really straining my nerves
No I stay up til 6:30 am, make a few shit plays and go to bed, then wake up right before market closes and see how much money I lost
Why the fuck are people talking about SNDL do they pretend to make EVs now too, seems trendy
yeah but you could say that because they havent announced it yet that it might not be good news and youre saying that this annoucement is going to double their market cap and the announcement alone is worth 2 billion dollars?

Then you have to consider all these foreigners buying usd with their currency to long the best stock in the planet.

Then you have all these workers afk puMping money into spy. 

US government tax revenue to gdp is at historic lows. This is literally the only way for usd to be deleted from money market accounts. 

All this usd just sitting around bidding up assets to infinity because cash is trash hot potato.

Competition with other services, fuel prices making it less worth it for drivers, reopening leading people to do things for themselves, gig economy and fee caps in the biggest states, and huge expenses.

Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

So that makes murder less then skipping the shot? 🤡 ok ladyboy
Why so vulgar my friend 😢
It’s an interesting theory and an outcome ive certainly considered. Similar to some other stocks they pumped and doing very similar things to. Personally the hardest thing to understand is how long their hidden shorts and FtDs can remain in derivatives. The option chain in January shows the story, I certainly don’t expect regulators to do anything, the system is some kinda messed, but so far my average is still great, I believe in RC for the long run, and yes I’m aware of its valuation based off of typical fundamentals. The buy button was removed in January and myself want to see this through. I’ve bet what I’m willing to lose and if I would have been shaken, It woulda happened, maybe

Snek🤡
A danger noodle
Actually i got sneked by a few ppl. It’s a secret cult 👀
&gt; I'm not done.
lol no. Just pointing out that they do a lot of other stuff too.
Also bought some DIS calls that probably aren't doing too well. Much offset by everything else tho
&gt; I don't banbet.
China is a bunch of farmers? Start there. Have fun, see you in the next class.
Please let SOXL dip at open. I’ll get out of these puts quickly 😬😬😬
Banbet what? You banbet. 

Gme will be 10 dollars in few years
Probably wont see it below $100 on IPO day.
Fully retarded. What's the deal with the warnermedia discovery merger? DISCsomething...becomes WBD? T straight sells without a stake in the new company?
^
Wats up
only if SPY pumps
**She FUCKED 8 GUYS HOLY FUCK MAN**
We dont need good person. We need someone who buys chynah and promotes it coz they hate money
I am 100% immunized against covid-19. I've been taking medical advice from my dog and he says all I have to do is eat my own poop
Banbet it if you so mad oooooohhhh BANBET!
You guys PUMPED for spy tomorrow?!!!
Snek me
The other guy is being purposefully dense.  The governor, or president in the case of federal execution, could call at any second to either stay the execution or commute the sentence.  For this reason, a prisoner on death row in the process of being executed will have his or her skin sterilized before the needle is inserted.
Him
who snekkin
Let him burn his puts
Vlta all in
The rest is trombones then?
Fucks money, gets bitches
Cope

Hey wait
Snek is here. Everything will be fine!
Snek guy
Nobody is going to acquire a company out of the gate at that valuation that has no proven product or actual production capacity.
Ahh so Elder means 2+ years. I didn't know what it meant when I first saw it. 

I guess I've been here since mid 2019. 

Time sure flies, huh
Uhhh $CMPS is shroom boom blowing up my account. Wtf is this drop?
Future melting up slowly
A mod
Gme 500 ? Very low. Why not make it 5k? A trillion dollar company ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Extremely fucked up retards we have here
Never thought I’d have beef w some bull on Reddit. Keep it coming you bastard!😤😤😤😤 and snek me pls for grins
Price doesn’t matter look at its market cap 🥴
Puts on this guy
&gt; Bay Area internet dies

&gt; Futures start recovering

Maybe us Commiefornians are the problem 🤔🤔🤔
Okay so like, if it is for novelty sake, like its not attached to actual upvotes, maybe fine.

But its just gonna turn into farm city if its actually connected to updoots.
Fairy dance. Whimsical af
OK I. Done with sneks for tonight I'll do more tomorrow night good luck everyone hope you all hit a a ten bagger tomorrow
i was smoking cigarettes on patios

Wipe twice then eat twice and that quadruples gme.. 500’EOD bitch. GameStop has all the Pokémon content you need idk why it’s not split yet
What is snek?
/u/zjz

What do you _do_, like for life/etc.?
look in the mirror, it's blinding lights.

back on the pussy tactics smh.
Sorry you heard some truths you didn’t like. Like I said, NIO is a good company and they are positioning themselves to be one of the more trust worthy brands. But there are still down sides and things holding them back and scalability is a real one.
Omfg!!
you'll get it back. the installation is taking a while
Their personal electronics segment, which includes calculators, makes up ~23% of revenue.
Him
I did a ticker search in thinkorswim but nothing came up
Damnnn
Calls on DraftKings because the refs are in cahoots. Legalized gambling is rigged.
Except even worse
I clicked the link lol
Correct
Do you wipe or eat those shit too?
I mean are you blaming the substance for your own need for growth?
just a guess: mebbe the guy doesn't die, so they have to schedule another time to do it and don't want him to get an infection in the meantime
Dont be pussy. We know its not going 1000 on day one. Lets be logical
[MFW my calls are -75% at open tomorrow](https://i.imgur.com/IYtb60m.jpg)
Probably a lot more than that. There have been so many extinction level events throughout the years: the Trump trade war tweets, height of COVID, Sept. 2020 (forgot what caused it), April 2021, Sept 2021 (interest rates rising), etc.
The “I can’t sleep” guy is just a friend she doesn’t want to annoy you

The main thing he should regret is that Mackenzie is a good person and his new girl is a thot.
Get on somewhere lol
Thank you, VM
ah the unbeaten feeling, nice.
&gt; You are a nuclear arsenal.
Who do I have to suck for a flair around here?
I talk shit about gme every night. Wtf wrong with you shitfuck? 

Gme is worse than toilet paper company. They make shit and apes like you wipe it
You mean, like tsla?
I have 800k karma, does that make me a nuclear arsenal?
Infection matters wen ded?
I bought puts
The stock or literal cans of soup?
no wonder I can't get it to tune
Honestly don’t see any way this tokenized karma shit could go well
Overpriced garbo
gitlab
Your ignorance is showing. Go read and come back later.
Did u buy the tsla dip?
It's like weaponized autism but even more autistic
I remember you were talking shit on gme last night. Lmao how do you feel now pussy
Mitigate infection risk during venipuncture
Every stock valued at ipo, will be traded lower after some days. Believe it or not
&gt; SOFI is down 6% after hours.
Jeff Bozo is an idiot for leaving sexy Mackenzie for a butter face
Wtf is tokenized karma
Fomo morning cash out at 2x. Watch bagholders cryinh here. Wait for it to be traded at 20 25 then buy again
They sell calculators though
cah you still trust in god and fair value. lol.
Thanks dad

So Rivian is set to open with a market cap where Lucid currently trades, though both have recent deliveries. Rivian also has their partnership with Amazon as well as a template for delivery trucks with the intent of selling to other companies. I'd say Rivian could possibly be bought out the gate, despite the valuations.
Dreams or nightmares
Short Reddit after they ipo

They’re trying to turn karma into tradable crypto. Will make this entire site filled with karma farming bots
If nukes all money goes to tesla
I bought my first trombone from them
Calls on COIN. Puts on HOOD
The amount of snek on me is damn high.
Not interested until they put Tetris 99 on their newer TI graphing calculators
*Drive 155mph to the store
Already watched turned me on
Actually why tho
Can’t believe SDC was ever a thing.
NIO needs another 5-10% growth from earnings and positive EV sentiment and I’m fucking golden. 17 48c 11/26
…and will sink to $50 on IPO day.
Shut up, street rat!
The stories of their treadmill severely injuring and even killing children and pets were a pretty good sign of things not going very well. Figured after that press push sales likely slowed a bit…  Thought it would dip. Didn’t know it would plummet.  I let high IV get to me.
All of it
I'm convinced at least 33% of the posters here got wiped the fuck out to a crippling degree and just shit post to stay up to date
Yeah but i will sell at top and go back in when it is traded at its fair value
Jokes on you, VM. My computer was stolen!
Rivian is meant to be famous. don't worry about the average.
True, sadly I'm non leveraged.
Texas Instruments is a remarkable company
Yeah it was a bad joke
Actually j might try this with you lol

NFLX needs to do a series on this Snek dude. Who the fuck is he? What is his origin? Why snek awards? Besides handing out Snek awards on WSB his only other posts are on r/mushroomporn (thats pretty weird) and r/memetron9000feet (that is **really** weird).
whats your guy's thoughts on RIVN apparently going to IPO this week around 72-75$
Do mods even trade? I feel like they're just here to shitpost. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
&gt; No, but I did install a keylogger onto your computer.
They’re the worst. Even the recording sounds like it’s getting off telling you tough shit.
Did you install a keylogger onto her phone or something?
Tokenized karma for anyone who’s ban bet prints.
Yeah

Nov 22nd - bagholders assemble to average their bags for insanely valued ev truck

I love confirmation bias thank you bro 🙏

I fucked up short term bought TSLA and SDC. Dumpster fire or hope for turnaround?
100% revenue comes from curious guys then. Hope it doesn't cost too much. You can also hit up your local dance clubs, parks, etc to see if you can find a friend.

They’re mostly free but there are paid options which get you more features like seeing who actually liked you. It always feels really scummy that they monetize that sort of thing but I guess they gotta make their money somehow.
xfinity doesn't value freedom. two chains on them.

Thanks for the rec I’ll check it out &lt;3
You mean "mooning"
Context? Is this a new Reddit feature?
The names blake
China is a bunch of poor farmers transitioning into the industrial revolution. It’s going to take some time before there is massive demand for 80k+ vehicles. Also NIO is a brand more than it is an automobile manufacturer. JAC motors actually manufactures their cars. And who knows if Willy Li will get the Jack Ma treatment one day and he’s the real vision behind the brand.
Math is hard don’t let the haters get you down

Rivian IPO this week. Bullish or bearish for other EV stocks short term? What say you brethren?
Long term hold. Not expecting any real movement until Congress moves forward with MORE Act or similar changes in policy
there is this company that used to sell bra and panties, apparently now they going to be selling ev cars

Ty for taking care of riffdex’s ban bet. I’m sure he didn’t bother to thank you 🙄
Opened up a Fidelity account and applied for options trading. Told them I have 10+ years experience trading (started trading during the GME frenzy in February) and told them I have a net worth of $500,000-$1,000,000 (I live in my parents garage, my net worth is a mini fridge and a PS4). Wish me luck, if I get approved for options Ill probably be a millionaire before year end.

I think with the Rivian IPO - that has hype, people who can’t buy will look elsewhere and LCID is perfect for that. For me it’s a hold till Thursday/Friday, cash out pre ER, buy back in when it settles back at early 40’s next week. My crystal ball told me so 🔮
Woah.

Day two on the road.

We easily dispatched the raiders yesterday, but they didn't have much for provisions or ammo.

Luckily enough, the token of their clan being killed fetched us a decent bounty at the next outpost.  A brief reprieve in the endless desert that America has become.

Between the dust storms and raids, it almost seems like a semblance of society.  

I took a brief look at my Robinhood app, futures down 1.2% 

"Green by open" I smirk to myself.
He hasn't looked at the put options expiring next Friday, nobody tell him
You have a point
Wait does that mean our karma is going to be used in a pump and dump? I’m in.
Sounds awful
It's because everyone is on their CB app watching Loopring save Gamestop.
Technical correction of 3-5% is good for market 

So we can rocket 20-30% further
High on potenuse baby

this counts as diversifying my portfolio right
Yep. Damn straight
That's a week you'll get to spend lambo shopping when PLTR is at 35 this friday, heh
I am not invested in NIO anymore but I am rooting for them. Solid company and I really like the ES8 design. The swappable battery tech is cool and they seem to have to best customer service for people to more easily transition to owning an EV.

I unexpectedly got a check for about 22k. I can spend it all tomorrow. Not sure what to do with it. Save for taxes next year, pay off some debt (I have one adjustable rate loan), throw it in the market, pay for a big bill I have coming up. I kinda feel like anything except for throwing it in the market is a bad idea.
Ah it’s that time of night, may some of you be blessed with the prestigious snek award.

I think I’m going to start a study soon that determines the effects of capitalism on populations. I have very strong reason to believe that our uncontrolled version of capitalism has selected for selfishness and greed as “successful” traits in our population. I will have to do this by comparing the brain anatomies for certain “areas of the brain” between large cadaver sample groups of people from capitalistic societies and people from communal based societies. Basically I’m going to prove what evil is and how it is selected for in nature, and bring physical evidence for a common sense answer. Wish me luck, your answers to my questions have inspired me.
big truth

also, I make sure to sell them on down days, don't sell puts on a +5% day for a stock

Went all in NEGG puts. Thoughts?
This is the exact kind of thing I think about but then immediately struggle with the thought of an electric F-150 and electric mustang and the new Ford maverick and wonder what else they have going on and think maybe this is the time they actually change it up for once after the last 20 years and try something new and break out of the constant low share price. 🤷‍♂️
I have 14 going right now.
Idk why I thought Rivian truck was 20k msrp. It’s around 70k. New hybrid ford maverick is 20k

Congrats on being 14. Helluva year
Thanks  Sirs, i have a situation and trying this for the first time. I bought 1000 shares of CC at 31.3 and then sold covered calls ( 10 contracts 33 strike with 21 jan 22 expiry and received $1200 premium, ) i always planned to sell at 33 so was ok with it. The stock beat earnings and yesterday briefly hit 33. 4 but my shares did not get called away. I still want to sell at 33 but i believe i cannot. Please help me understand what i should be doing and is it mandatory for the buyer to take assignment of the shares.
I don't really think its started
Kudos to you F holders but i feel like it’s going to upset so many people tomorrow
I’m only here to tell you mf that my crush said she liked me back
I have dis calls so you should def buy weekly otm puts because it’ll tank.

If it takes the market cap of other EVs ill take it haha. Then again it could just pump them all
Sweet gives me some time to shuffle some options around tomorrow
Volta!
Nope!, LCID month 🚀🚀🚀
Literally nothing that happens between now and the end of time with this stock invalidates what I just said.  It’s higher than it’s been for an entire generation, and is up over 150% from this exact time last year.  Choosing now to buy calls when you had over 18 months to do so and get a great entry, is retarded.

Keep fighting the good fight then brother
Nah, 31 🥰
Would you mind telling me vaguely what you do for a living? People who say stuff like this are usually comfortable and ARENT making minimum wage like most people so the system works for them and they like their place on the totem pole

Yeah, BB has been super lame. So flat.
Tying up money for long periods (potentially), but mostly it's just the risk of being wrong on your strikes - grabbing shares from a CSP just to see the price fall further, missing a run on the stock price by getting CCs called away. You're trading steady profit for maximized profit.
Shit, I'm sorry. At least you have the market. It will always try to fuck you.
🤡🍑
It's excludable but non-rivalrous,  so more of a club good.

Am EV company in a totally different segment is gonna tank another EV company that doesn’t do trucks yet? Spot on analytics there.
Never heard of them. Ticker?
Chill on meth
The risk is you bought shares, but the underlying keeps going down. Options volume could dry up and you'd have nobody to sell covered calls to for .01 in 3 months. IV can just perish completely and you're not able to sell any contracts for worthwhile returns.

That's not what I was asking, fellow human.
You right
shares go down so much that selling covered call is no longer profitable.
the underlying tanks after u get assigned
U so mad kid. Just do better that’s all

Yes. Don’t listen to these twats.
This right here . SDC bought me so much crap I didn’t need.writing was on the wall a month +ago. I moved on and others stayed.
Sorry your friend has been fucking your wife.
China is asshole
Underlying could sink through your CSP you buy, and it keeps going down.
Or on the other side, imagine selling CC on Tesla 2 months ago.
Isn't the ipo only available to SoFi users?

That’s pretty sad. People are willing to just live like farm animals for the rich
My issue is the sensory deprivation that comes with VR. It's fun for short periods of time, but people have hundreds of thousands of years of evolution telling them to pay attention to shit around them for survival. Granted, I know very little about Zuckerbergs plan, so maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like an uphill battle.
As you can see from the down votes, no one here wants to hear about you holding amc
I hope Coty goes up a few bucks
So you profit in all cases , what's the risk?
Nah but I'm not actually retarded, I just pretend to fit in with everyone else.

Is sex a commodity? If so when will it be added to the futures exchange?
Sell cash-secured out at a low strike that you would think is a bargain. If you don’t get assigned, you pocket the credit. Repeat.
If you get assigned, turn around and sell covered calls at a strike you would be happy to sell for. I target 5% return against share cost. If I get called away, great. If I don’t sell another CC.
It wheels if you get called away. You start the cycle back again by selling a CSP

You’re asking if you should buy calls on a boomer stock that is up over 100% YTD, and is up over $20 for the first time in 20 years??? And NOW is when you decide you want to buy them?

thats part 2, start by selling cash secured puts, do that until you get shares assigned, then sell covered calls on them till they get called away, rinse and repeat

Indeed, not saying Ford is great, but the scale of Tesla's market cap is still insane, 1.15Trillion, that's almost the entire Infrastructure Bill that was passed.

Dang my guys out here working solo. The only reason i even said it was a friend of mine was a garbage man for a while. Side note if you don’t know what you want to do in life a CDL is a worthy stepping stone in the right direction. Dude delivers alcohol now and works 4 10s for 28$ per hour with all the ot you could ask for, benefits and a decent retirement. You won’t make millions but you will eat decently
The richer you are, the less time you need using VR to feel good about your existence.
That would be cool, they usually do well but now that I’ve said that it’s likely cursed
No options too expensive, I started buying in the mid $600’s
Yeah but fuck rivian they want to be valued at 1T so that they can do offering and dilution early and let everyone hold big bags
Don’t we all

Why is no one talking about the runners CHPT, BLNK, PTRA, NEGG, etc from today? You guys not playing EV’s? (I know NEGG isn’t EV)

About to be pumped to $100. People are going to miss out big time
The America Dream is drilled into us from the start. It's a hard chain to break. The rich get richer. CEOs make 400x their average employee salary. A never ending cycle. Unfortunately, I doubt it will change.
It’s coming sir 80$ by next year
Volatile AF, you holding options??
I’m bullish on Tesla.
[deleted]
What was it
Ipo tomorrow really?
The spice? As a man?
if you’re banking on EV sales, Fords got more than Lucid and based on infrastructure can produce more with a wider distribution channel, and proven track record to pump cars out. How is Lucid going to make make money if they can’t even mass produce cars. Tesla didn’t pop until after they mass produced model 3 and even then it’s not that impressive. We’re in a speculative market, you’re speculating as much as I am. Except in this case, Ford is speculated less so based on trade price and market cap than Lucid. Lucid can go to $100 but longer term they aren’t going to be worth crap if they can’t mass produce
&gt; Tesla is a car company, but it has other businesses as well.
Learn how to read the tea leaves you fukin loser
Tesla does more just cars.

Ford is also a shitty company with shit vehicles and lots of debt from a bailout from over a decade ago. 100 more years at their current profits and maybe theyll pay it off?

Ford isnt worth much because they do one good thing and their future is meh. They make  trucks that appeals to white collar office guys who wear cowboy hats on the weekend. Everything else is some clunker you risk your life in or niche shit for car meetup dorks.

Ford is still paying for a goverment bailout from  over a decade ago. Their debt is still massive.

Their evs that they announced thst are years away  would compete with what? A shitty Chevy you could buy today?


GM and Ford have massive debts after a shitty bailout that attempted to save them. The US governent lost like 11 billion on GM


Meanwhile these companies are taking risks with their debt. Expecting another bailout if it fails? Fuck them.

Women change alot once they hit 23
Why
I’ve more than tripled my portfolio since going all in on 🌽 miners
They despise the elites but want to be them. They'd do the same shit if they were in their position, they're just upset they aren't in the position to be the corrupt elite. Most people only care about money and themselves, that's what America is about. It's all about the individual and fuck everyone else.

She'll change her mind when I hit it big and drive up to work in my brand new Lucid™
I'm loading up 2month DTE 70c for $CF as market opens.

World is in serious Diesel Exhaust Fluid(DEF) shortage, which is contributing to already fucked supply chain issues. Modern Diesel vehicles don't operate if DEF is not filled. Fluid's primary chemical (Urea) gets extracted mostly from coals and Xi Jinping has been buying all the coals from the Asian/Aussie markets so DEF supply has been drought in eastern hemisphere.

$CF is one of the biggest DEF manufacturer in North America and raw material supply is stable. As DEF price keep rising, they will collect some yummy profit margins.
🤣🤣 Sounds like a party
Workhorse rallied today lmaooooooo
F broke out at $16 and has been mooning, more mooning means retail getting bags dumped on them, less mooning means priced in. You see why you got gamblers at this junction?

What you think it closes at by Friday?
COST and DOCN. DOCN just getting started and COST is a solid play in good and bad economic times.
doesn’t justify their their valuation, we can all agree amazing shit, but until they mass produce or make billions per quarter, you can’t be worth more than a Ford or GM

Lucid is the only company that broke the 500 mile range with their battery. Can go 0-60 in 2.7 seconds. Top speed of 168 mph. Just blowing away everyone's stats.

Peoole forget that Lucid was a legit company who did powertrains and batteries for others and poweed the entire Formula E racing scene which is the premier form of open wheel electric racing.

Prior to Lucid (Atieva), races were battery limited to half their distance...but with Lucid's tech they can go the full distance. Every single car in the Formula E is powered by them. 

Yet ignorant trolls act like Lucid is Nikola drawing fake pictures of trucks.

The big car companies, a lot of them are a half decade to a full decade behind the top EV players. 

And its not just selling cars that makes Lucid attractive. You know the big companies will pay a pretty penny to have Lucid's tech in their own cars.

I just realized that 450m purchase just lost 85m today. So I no longer think they “knew something we don’t” or anything like that. If it wasn’t just a giant gamble they would’ve waited
I am so pissed at myself. I bought a bunch of leaps on NVDA and AMD about 6 weeks ago near the previous highs. Then it started to crash with everything else and I pussied out and sold. Both of them are up about 40% since I bought the leaps.

If anyone likes stocks that have a good deal of growth left to get back to pre pandemic levels, that also are paying fat dividends at the same time… Here’s a few I really like.

Basically, while the stocks are growing substantially back to normal levels, they also pay you nice checks in the process to protect you.

PBFX - PBF Logistics pays an 8.83% dividend and has a good 80% to appreciate still with great momentum

PBA - Pembina Pipeline pays a 6.2% dividend while having a 50% runway to get to current price targets of around 48$

RWT - Redwood Trust pays a 6.25% dividend while having about a 50% gap to pre pandemic levels

CIM - Chimera pays a 8.07% dividend while having about 45% to run back to pre pandemic levels

EPR Properties - owns Top Golf and pays a 6% dividend while having a 70% runway to pre pandemic levels.

Even if the conspiracies are true, they’ll continue to just slowly bleed it back out of you guys. 

Close a bunch of positions, pumps to 230, you all fomo more money in instead of taking profits, pumps to 240, they sell every share they bought to cover at a small profit. 

Then wait another month to repeat the process until one day it never pumps again. 

I will never touch GME or AMC again. Toxic shit if you don’t already own it way way below. And if you own it way way below and haven’t taken your profits, you’ll be holding until it’s back where you started.
Haven’t bought yet. Was gonna see what happened during market tomorrow.
Stay away. You missed the boat and your gonna die swimming after it or get run over on the way back down.

Check out Glass Animals discography bro. This one I linked is one of my favorite songs. Lmk what you think.
You dont really "buy" or "sell" a futures contract, you enter the contract and post margin, what that margin is depends on the time of day, brokerage, and how much money is in your account and how it works with your intraday margin. 

12.5K is the initial margin to hold overnight for spy. (called /ES in future speak).

Intra-day it can be alot less depending on your broker.

My intra-day margin is 6K, 12.5K overnight. if i have over 25K in my account, its 4K intra-day. 

NQ is 16K-&gt;10K-6K. (this is QQQ)

RTY is like 7K-&gt;4K-&gt;800. (this is IWM)

CL (Oil) is 8K-&gt;4K-&gt;800 (there is no stock ticker version of this, this is a commodity directly, if you hold until expiration you are on the hook to take ownership of actual oil.) 

GC (gold) has similar margin to CL/Oil.


Your loss or gain on futures contracts determines how many points/ticks you were in profit for during the time you held it. The tick value changes based off product. 
 The tick value for ES is 12.5, with a total of 4 making 1 point, or 50 dollars. 10 points = 1 dollar of spy. so if you enter /ES at 4700, when Spy is 469 (the futures off-set usually by 1 dollar to their ETF equ.), and hold for 1 dollar spy move up, that will be a 10 point move on /ES. meaning 1 dollar of spy=500 dollars move. Thats with just 1 lot of ES.

Imagine holding 10 lots, with a 40K account using the lowest margin? thats 5K per dollar in spy. 

You guys think your 0dte are degen shit, you dont know degen shit, when .02% move on SPY could BTFO you.


Options are literally a scam if you're using them on a ticker that has a futures product for it.

I’m not sure if you’re being wry, but there is no cost to a futures contract, it’s just an agreement between two people to exchange money based on an index price at delivery. All that is charged is a piddling transaction fee.
Why would you say that and not post a link?
ofc what is money anyways?
ding ding ding.
Measures the average change over time in selling prices received by domestic producers of goods and services. I am expecting a great PPI # as there are no tariffs. This further indicates a stronger economy.

Definitely not a permabull. Market due for a small pullback. Market will undoubtedly resume smashing ATHs by next week. Market can't stop going up. I hate it. 5here is a lot to be bearish about EXCEPT that there's a shit ton of money on the sidelines and nowhere for it to go but stocks. Only reason I'm bullish is because there's no alternative that's rational

You are on fire tonight bb
Market has been really good this year actually
We're down 0.29% tonight
Welcome loser, just don’t mention GME / AMC
Up 40% on MARA today. Tomorrow might be just as good. LFG! 🚀
Yes one refund please
Yeah it's pretty tempting... way overvalued, not making money, losing drivers and customers... I might do a debit spread or something before close idk yet.

You’d think…
This sort of reminds me of late May/early June.

We're sort of seeing some red days but they're only slightly red after gap ups... meaning on net we're still moving up.

Look at late May/early June, we had 9 red days in a span of 13 days, but markets kept moving up because we'd keep gapping up.

Past 2 days has been like that.  Doesn't mean it'll continue, but there's no reason not to be bullish at the moment.

Burry is back on his Twitter machine to comment on Tesla 🤣. When’s he gonna learn?
Do me a favor. Zoom out to the 1y, 3y, 6mo, whatever. Look at the uptrend. Then look at how spaced out the very regular minor dips are. 4-6 weeks apart. There hasn't been a period of more than 8 weeks without one. Probably ever. It's a healthy ebb to the flow of bull cum. Permabull all you want. Price action your eye balls all night long. I'm wary of a couple red days and won't hold weeklies over night till I see a healthy dip.
I don’t think futures traders know what the fuck they are doing
canyonerooooo!!!!

Not on HOOD it’s on fidelity and other crap banks that bought it at the low and selling high to gain what they lost from all the shorts that have been capitalized. Rivian sounds like a Trap like D Wack
I've nearly pulled the trigger on 190s twice now... no way it's good a good ER...

I think you’d be surprised how good VR has gotten recently, especially in the not making people nauseous department, but the newest and most advanced sets are clearly out of the everyday consumers range. The best ones also require yearly subscriptions as well.
&gt; You would need to make a lot of money. If you made enough, I think it is a good idea.
I’m in on 12/17 $230c. It’ll be down 50% at the open unless it recovers pre market.
Hopefully they’ll go bankrupt and I won’t have to pay them for my purchases

I will dump puts but I am not sure about buying calls just yet. I will wait this out till Friday see if I can get some better opportunities.
Why????
how much would you need to make on otm calls to get a jpow tattoo?

Looking at SPY price movement there haven’t been any of those days and I don’t expect them till Feb. SPY has ended green each day 99% of the time and this here is the “consolidation” you mentioned.
PYPL positions?
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.

Then someone forgets to close the rear door all of the way and the dome light drains battery.  Three weeks later, you are finally discovered fighting your family members over the last grizzled scraps of what used to be the family dog.

Not sure what the market is going to do tomorrow but one thing for sure is my accts are gonna get fuked bukkake style 🤕
I'm not saying major pullback. I'm saying slump. 2 days of red. One bad red day followed by a sluggish morning. Something the market can use as "consolidation" and a launch point for bullishness. It happens every 4-6 weeks like clockwork and the market is due for one
Sounds like I will make a lot of $$$$

Hmmm

Drill team 6 can end your country. MS-13 will just traffic your daughter and torture a few people while they sell fentanyl...

There's levels to this game
But.. but but she also had Paypal calls. I picked the one she misjudged.
Yea I was just checking it out. Just need a tweet from Roaring Kitty, and my tiddies will be jacked

**THIS OFFICIATING IS FUCKING HORRIBLE AND I DONT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT EITHER TEAM BUT HOLY FUCK**
Calls on diabetes and obesity cuz next generation kids are gonna be hooked on metaverse and fukd
We will have it before you’re 40
Why?
Amd 163 tomorrow
Market double top combined with tapering and rate hike news. I just hope it doesn't dip too far in the next couple weeks. Should be a great set up for a Santa rally.
Can't wait to hangout with everyone at the wallstreetbets stronghold in the metaverse :) saranghaeyo!
But those TLT Puts Gona hit hard later 🤑
NULL VOID AND CUCKED
I bought them for earnings, 5 81c Exp this Friday. RBLX is +30% AH. IV crush doesn't matter when you're this deep in the green

What should I go balls deep on ?
Sold my calls. Holding shares.
Also concerned about this…
Fucking piece of shit. Stfu
Where u gonna go though 

Also what if lawnmower man gets u 


U be trapped :/
You're gonna tell me PYPL didn't sign a deal with AMZN?  ? ???? Fakurs
DRILL TEAM 6 vs. MS-13
I respect the grind. Big buys on no news are big buys. On no news. Thoughts on seasonality saying a minor 2-3 day pullback is due this week? I think the market might be positioning to make it a self fulfilling prophecy after PPI/CPI readings. Either that or there's a pullback after the peak of extreme bullish moves the next two days. I'm bullish but not going balls deep till I see a pullback. Long run the last 3 weeks and the market is horny for a quick downturn
&gt; The contracts are void.
Have you tired Ryan Cohen's Twitter? Because shit is going down right now.
I have already been to the future and I am here to tell you that in the future there will only be 5 Nations. They will be what is today known as MAANG. 

Instead of going home to a physical 4 walled building, we will simply lie and live inside a hyper sleep pod created by Oculus.

The currency we will use will not be USD, RMB, Gold or even corn. We will measure and exchange monetary value in shares of MAANG.
THE CONT- THE CONTRACTS ARE VOIDED?

GME to $300 EOW????
Uranium gonna pull back tomorrow I think. I don’t want it to but it’s such a tease. Gold too
You can still live like a 30 year old in metaverse and hit on 25 yr old chics when you are 60
A conspiracy of money making
New Ryan Cohen Tweet saying Hold! 🤯
I took the bears ML and the over 40 parlay 🙏
the future is meta chorus
She was gonna video tape herself”bed and getting eaten out” 🤦‍♂️
I would have simply replied “Address?” To the first one

Buy some bud

IV crush loves you
This is true
Nope
Yea duh thats why its called "meta" verse and not regular verse
Maybe ur just ugly
I am so fuking fuked 🤕
I’m well aware, been in it since like $9ish. Just saying recent price action shows people are exciting
Serious question, As like a 30 year old. By the time the metaverse is actually a real thing people use effectively, will I be to boomer to use or appreciate it
Is this 15 year old a YouTube furu or something?
Already happen today
I remember back in the olden days, going to the GME mega thread for steady confirmation bias
YETI puts
Probably that it’ll hit
After careful consideration, tomorrow I will go balls deep into Ford.
[deleted]
It says Rivian range is $72-74. Which tells me LCID can easily go above $50. They are delivering luxury cars, have stores open in major markets, and have an Energy Storage business.
Yep gotta hurry tomorrow morn

I would like to, I don't actually know the magic phrase for the bot.
Lost in the smoke
I sold a 2003 Toyota Corolla with 215,000 miles on it for more than I paid for it almost two years ago. I got ten emails in the first 15 minutes of posting the ad.  I could have asked for more and feel like I paper handed the car.
looking at TA, should've pulled back already
I'm in! It's delayed, of course, because they don't have to report right away, but all her trades are golden: [https://app.capitoltrades.com/trades?page=1&amp;pageSize=20](https://app.capitoltrades.com/trades?page=1&amp;pageSize=20)

Edit: actually not; she bought Paypal options, which has been screwing me over the past month.
THAT IS NOT TRUE I HAVE A MASSIVE PICKLE
Deciding between two options for my GME shares: HOLD or HODL…
Until you find out they don’t have insurance lol.
Place is dead
How does 500 sound?
YOU SHUT YOUR WHORE MOUTH!!!
RIVN
Spy was rallying hard last week, bullish thesis it continues to do so, bearish thesis is momentum wares off and overbought. 

Depends on market, low volume today and traded sideways giving it to theta gang.

Tomm defines the trend, if we open and rip green I’ll be holding.
as long as the major correction isn't under Powell's watch, he'll just kick the can until he's replaced
Not meme-worthy.
Being a bear feels safer for some reason. I have RBLX calls, but holding these SDC puts feel so much better
Noooooice.
Unsure if the Chicago Bears or the WSB bears suck harder.
Attach pic?
2 good steaks.
Yes.... :/

RIVN bout to rip!!!!!!

Suck it Elon!!!!
It’s a 5 cylinder oddly enough. But has the a great power to weight ratio and great awd.
Look at fords charts and tell me people aren’t excited
Great, they are involved in most mobile games
Buy a proustite
Except even more ads and zoomers
GME

I can't wait to re-enact my favorite movie Schindler's Fist in the Metaverse.

Huge rally last year at this time. All the way until the end of January.
How will you charge the tesla with your big ass truck blocking the charging station?
If you have a 7 figure account losing 10% isn’t that wild.
There still meme stocks nowadays, or is it all just SOFI?

Wearable sock/ pulse oximeter for measuring babies vitals, patented.  

Pending FDA approval to be an approved medical device and thus reimburstable via insurance, applied back in 2019.  News on that is expected in q4 or q1 (maybe an update this ER?)

Incredibly popular product and it's technicals show it's oversold in my opinion.
Might be a good idea to get banned lol

Little unknown fact about boomers. 

Some boomers were not taught phonetics.

My mom constantly butchers words. 

There was a time period where they stopped teaching that to children and it was when boomers were kids.

So he probably didn't even know he was butchering the correct word.

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/SlimyMarvin (1/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1075.0 when it was 1219.5 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Either gonna turn these 40 170cs into 100k on AMD or 0. Ready to ride

My undies are ruined from multiple cum shots watching my puts
Rivian just raised its price target by 16%. Which means more moon time for LCID. LCID also has the energy storage play.
&gt; It's a correction.
There is a lot more poor people.  Billions of them
Used pocket pussy*
Gme calls
Gonna ride SOFI and RIOT for as long as possible
They have been
Yes but the government will subsidize so they will profit off tax dollars.
I think it’s a steal. Go long $PYPL
Is there a magic phrase I use for the automod?
that was a ruthless pullback for everything but tech... Might be a reversel,? tech down since its so high up and small caps up?
I really need to sack up and fire up a yolo

Don't fucking upvote me anymore I've got 888 karma rn which is a great number in China. Need some luck for the calls I have tomorrow
GME calls are expensive a fuk right now...
Yes. PPI # will be bullish AF at 8:30 AM EST.
Any minute now
Feeling pretty good about this PYPL 220p I picked up at closing.
Just a feeling. Quite a run up the past few weeks, no bank charter announcement yet, and I’m a holder, but I’m probably wrong like the other 70% of my plays.
WEN calls
Guud lord :)

Beautiful, hope you get some nice gains this week, be sure to post them
OP made a bet it’s gonna go back to 90 from 100 which it hasn’t done
Up about %40… only because of shares. I’m right at even with options now.

So many rich people in this world and I'm poor AF. Does God not love me?

No 😆
It depends on the conspiracy theory, do you have an example
How long will Rivian be trading for before it halts? I’m guessing 3 minutes.
It will continue until next week because CEO gonna speak tomorrow and next week November 17th is Earning. META world is pretty hyper right now and both NVDA and AMD is in it so buy one of them and you should be good to go.
Do you people who bet on ev charging stocks know that 99.999% of charging is done overnight at home?
I guess it was about the retards we met along the way all along
Lol 😆 during February when gme went to 40$ I guess in my sleep I was saying hold the stock hold the stock Hahahah I hope your dreams and everyone else’s on here come true 🤑🥳🤩
No, but it will moon to 30 prior, so as long as you pay attention and sell at the top you won’t have to wait more than a couple weeks (not financial advice)
Start with $2000
Pypl puts doordash calls
No one deserves to be cancelled. Not even worthless Travis Scott. That’s what is wrong with cancel culture.
GME gonna be a metaverse player shit is gonna pop whenever they make an announcement
Can't wait to have sex with animals in the Metaverse.

Is everything a conspiracy over at a certain GME cult subreddit?
Really think F will move to 50 by then???
Radio is for poser sheeps
NVDA might be faster than FB, how much % more does FB and NVDA needs?
Nah, when Rivian IPOs, people are going to FOMO hard into anything related and ford owns 15% of Rivian lol
Dave chapelle parody 🙃
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

I know what you mean. It was cool to think this sub had their own genius bot minion. But I guess that already exists in a way with banbets
Got 15 of them for .66 and then sold 10 of them when it hit 1.69. 
Probably going to add another 1.5k in options tomorrow though.

I just can’t respect it. Real bears move in silence and violence, hes just another charlatan like guhthie thinking they are smarter than everyone and can sway sentiment with their “power”.

Yea I think raising the rates to stop inflation will cause small correction in other hand kicking the can down the road and not doing anything will cause a severe stagflation (no more transitory) which is when we will see a major correction.

What is the point of releasing earnings after hours when institutions dump or buy anyway as soon as they are out?
None of us are. The moment you start to believe otherwise they have you.
Why?
Seems legit...
Just because it went nearly vertical the past couple of months, doesn't mean it'll drop. After FB hits $1 trillion market cap, NVDA is next in line.
Based on the current administrations ability to make absolutely terrible decisions, we should price Brainard in at this point.

It’s actually very conceivable that Powell could be replaced given what Biden saw in Virginia and the close call in deep blue NJ. 

They’re already bracing to lose the house and senate in the upcoming elections. 

His approval rating has dropped to 38%.

They’re probably getting really desperate and will try to do as much as the my can before the term is up and replacing the fed chair with one of their own is just one those things they think can do before then.

Regarding what elon musk NEEDS to sell because of the proposed unrealized gains tax, or to #solveworldhunger, or...well, there is the matter of the tax-free cash he took out in the form of personal loans  backed by 88.3 million of his shares at June 30th.

Not going to be surprising when that 3-4 AM super green dildo comes up on futures and we open the same exact place we left off. Then we’ll pump a bit on zero volume as they say investors await CPI data. 

CPI data comes in much higher then expectations, market agrees because FED said to expect high inflation. Then headline on CNBC this Wednesday after market close. “Investors shrug off Higher inflation”. Then Thursday and Friday we drill -3%.
Mr. VisualMod, will SPY break 470 tomorrow?
PLTR works well. I'm at $4300 on the year just from PLTR theta plays. ER is tomorrow though so you may want to wait on a better entry.

Or they tease you and initiate the sexual tension but then turn you down. They will go to the 7th circle of hell for that with PTON and SDC
fundamentals haven't matter in so long that I don't even look at it anymore.

As for inflation, depends on what the Fed decides to do. They can either raise interest rates which will cause a crash or they can redefine inflation and just kick the can down the road and keep interest rates at 0.

It's always shriveled and sticky.
They are non-standard options contracts and won’t be traded on the open market. What’s for certain is some big players hold the contracts. MM’s wouldn’t be holding deep ITM contracts like that. MM’s are primarily making money off arbitrage and it’s not their goal to play theta gang or write long term calls. Basically when Tesla awarded Elon with those options they approached a large institution that was willing to write contracts at that strike and expiration date. 

Now they might have sold off those contracts in the meantime (perhaps to another institution that is hoping Tesla stock price decreases before they are exercised), and ironically to sell the contracts they probably had to pay the receiving institition a pretty penny to take the obligations off their hand - but it protects the original institution if Tesla continues to go up and up and up. 

But at the end of the day, some big money players are holding the obligations to those calls and will be forced to purchase TSLA at market value and provide the shares to Elon if he exercises.
Unfortunately there is really no bottom for that stock given revenue drop

Yes please!!!!
I feel like people who say this don’t actually follow the $TSM ticker. 

I have a lot of shares in my fidelity long term holding account. Only bringing that up to say i’ve been following the price action all year, and since last year. After the initial February rise and decline, it keeps rejecting 116, 117, a couple rallies above 120, as high as 123/124.

But it always declines again to the 115 range and on bad market days it goes to 108,109.

So like, i get it. Its a good company yadayada but it hasn’t really held gains all year.
So are we at the bottom for SDC
I’ve lost $50k in a day. Life’s a garden, keep on digging

The market is real and straight
TSLA move was all gamma. You had so many articles saying how many call options were open for it or how its options were traded more than SPY.

Flat-red days do break that momentum

Short the stock

A single year?  Try a single hour.  You are talking to a group where one person almost had to take physical delivery of oil on a commodity contract.  One who had to offload 1000s of gourds.

NVDA leaps continue to prinnntttttt
The market we live in goes like this,

Rumors NVDA is getting metaverse deal pumps like 20%, but AMD gets it instead, so that pumps 20% NVDA still pumps some more so why not.


Rumor about PINS getting bought out by PYPL, 3 days later LOLOLOLJKJKJK.

TSLA and HRTZ we have a deal we don’t have a deal, meanwhile HRTZ can’t afford bikes let alone cars, but they’ll take 100,000 Tesla’s for full retail. Fuck it pump both 30%

Related to the market.  Ban doesn't apply.
LCID manufactures EV rockets now. To the moon and never coming back.
There are no calls at that strike though. I thought options chains are only good for like 2 years so who’s holding 7$ calls? Its gotta be a market maker or something “insider-ish”
True
Sword art online, the seed?
Are you suggesting someone... FBI entered the chat

Also the 1500 dollar uvxy 150 calls
LCID is the next TSLA. Easy buy
I was thinking that today. I like the guy a lot. But my puts would make bank if he gets hit by a bus.
PayPal announced they recreated the Tasmanian Tiger and you get a free one on every order. Up 50% at open
I sold 35 shares of Tesla at $650 to DiVeRsiFy My PoRtFoLiO like a retard. Then I sold like 13,000 covered $16 Ford calls for not a lot of premium like a month before the announcement of the Lightning pickup because it had been hovering in one spot for a while. And also I sold like 300 shares of AMC at $20 because i was sure it would drop back down and the next couple days it went up to $60.
Time frame of losing or making it back?
This is mostly Hopium. But like I feel like this is it for the Elon selling news, there were a lot of good news out today for tesla. If anything 1200+ can happen tomorrow. Hopefully it’s at premarket and can keep the momentum
Clearly you don’t understand deep otm

Idk seems like she's in favor of low interest rates and QE and also free markets that doesn't seem hawkish imo

Highly educated economists are not against raising the US national debt
It's 2021 where even a slight dip is quickly bought. 0.5% drop is a big deal these days.

People like to circle-jerk against DWAC but let’s be real, it’s very possible it hasn’t seen its ATH yet. Yeah it’s probably overvalued but once it deSPACs it will have ~4 billion market cap (at its current price) with mango’s name attached to it, and and an app with likely millions of users in the first month after launch. You can laugh, but most VCs would get a hard on at the thought of getting equity in a startup with that much growth and a $4b valuation. Even if the business eventually fails, plenty of boomers who don’t know what a SPAC is will probably buy in after merger

If Joe doesn't keep JPow, he's as dumb as the right says he is...
I don’t care who the fed chair is because the same outcome will happen regardless. When they meet up they don’t “plan whats best for the economy” that takes about 5 minutes and any idiot should know what the right choice is. They decide on what they will do for their schemes so they and pelosi capitals calls print. I could tell you the responsible path in 5 minutes but that’s not what america is about. It’s about riches keeping poors in the rat race. Nothing else. You’re high if you don’t understand this, everything is predetermined with these fuckers. New FED chair just means a new paid SCAPEGOAT FOR BLAME

Im screwed then on my 11/19 242c
see how it is tomorrow and go with your gut. maybe tomorrow it’ll be green. if not then gtfo and take what’s left of your money before you lose it all. how much money did you put into it? next time definitely don’t buy after a such a mega green day, don’t trade such short dated options, and stick with stocks that don’t fluctuate so much. Amazon is worth over 3k so it changes in 5-10 dollar increments, which is very risky for options. Also, you need to have a stop loss earlier next time. you definitely shouldn’t have watched 6k go down the drain. best of luck
Earth is round, sky is blue, Pelosi's calls are printing, nothing new.
Google can say whatever it wants to say, she’s a highly educated economist against raising debt. This mean she wouldn’t be printing trillions to hold up markets. She expects markets to sort themselves out, survival of the fittest

I bought it around 12.57/share and it dropped to as low as 6.63/share in October 20th I sold a 9 dollar call for some premium but now it's super in the money. What a world.
Damn. Here in Iowa they give you the electric chair for anything more than 1/4 ox
Hate when girls take forever to reply. Like how the hell am I supposed to jack off like that.
No, I don’t think anyone has done that or better here
Only reason paypal down is cuz Cramer sold after hours. Paper handed bitch
Braintard will kill your 401K and portfolio folks. She would do it so quick you wouldn’t believe it 🙌. It’ll make your head spin 👐.
I bought Jan puts. IV at 60 when I picked them up.
Same as well😭
You’re supposed to rub it and yell **RED ROCKET** until the surprise comes out.
SPY: 30x 11/19 480c, 2x 11/12 478c

INTC: 2x 11/19 52c
Why red
Diamond hands pays off when you’re right
Okay let me give you guys a quick rundown. The White House can consider whoever they want, the fact of the matter is JPow made everyone extremely wealthy. Queen Pelosi would never allow it.

JPow is here to stay, all that noise is just FUD.
 they ban you if someone reports
The metaverse is a scam in the short term. Like EV was.
Same. Bought another today when retards BTFD. Got like 20k in it now so I’d prefer a down day for sure.
Well that's not true. All I'm saying is brainard studied economics and jpow studied law. I personally adore the work Jerome has done but if someone who has the economics background and similar ideals as him could really do some great shit I think
Far from hawk
All he needs is a "yiikes" facial expression about the CPI or anything about the Fed being too dovish right now. He could probably wink at the right time while rambling about transitory and it'd crash the market
Kyle plays xbox
His job is done, contracts over and now he burns the assignments profile
Need to make back 20k....anybody ever comeback from this far down? I've never lost this much in a single year lol
Should be tomorrow
I would think so maybe for sure
You have TSM puts??? Wtf is wrong with you dude I could have given you shit that had a chance for puts
I have 9 oz in my cabinet for that reason
Either 148 or 152

First tip - don’t average down. Dumbest advice perpetuated on this sub. 

Averaging down is catching a falling knife. 

Especially with options. 

Only time I could advocate averaging down is with stocks you have very strong conviction in and that you plan to hold for a long time. 
This should be with companies that have many years of demonstrable growth and profit. 

So, anyhow, yes I would suggest cutting your losses and moving on. 
Is there a chance it will go up and you’ll kick yourself ? Ya. But there is also a chance it will go to 0 and you will regret not getting out earlier. 

I always prefer owning up to my investing mistakes early and moving onto another play.
She’s not.

Academics tend to lack common sense and absolutely fail at management and practical solutions to real problems. They live in theory and not implementation. We have way too many academics running things in government.
stock too high imo.

That doesn't really mean much though. Inflation is problematic, but that doesn't mean hawkish policies are the answer

Don’t feel like I have to post here, just like getting opinions is all. Gonna hold off a year or 2 probably on asking her though, we’re trying to get our own place together and want to experience that a bit more than just a weekend or week here and there
She is hawkish as fuck, she is alpha hawk. Eats doves
Why all of a sudden we talking about Brainard? Meeting was days ago. Any new news?

Rip mate. Sell that shit. Dont buy FDs especially expensive Amazon ones unless you know what your doing
Crash me daddy ;)
I have no idea what this is supposed to mean. Is eagle more hawkish or dovish. I couldn't imagine the dems would appoint a staunch contractionary chair

A true WSB trader… cut your losses or roll them down
Welcome to the shit.  It might go back up, it might go back down, it might stay the same. Everyone here is a retard.
Wouldn’t be against that seeing how it’s been a straight line up since October.  Can’t go wrong with VIX calls a couple months out.

Sold RBLX calls, held PYPL calls. AMA.
Reply with the positions you have going into to tomorrow. ACTUALLY curious about ppls moves tomorrow

Keep it to 0 or moon

This girl at the gym so bad, should I show her my portfolio

Crash, means lets pump the market again. The gov owns this debt. Enjoy it.
If the fed chair were to be someone as dovish as jpow but with an actual economics educational background I don't see what the issue would be. Honestly everybody could be winners here jpow included
Exactly this. Cramer tried to convince mouthbreathing retail traders to sell baba at 90 years ago. I bought all their shares and made bank. I’m doing it again now. The rest is history
My point is it’s better to have some skin in the game and take a loss if there’s some dramatic pullback than sit on the sidelines constantly squawking about “the top is in the crash is coming!!!!”
He can crash it with just a few words :)
It’s actually the other way around. If you give them those names, they have to be part of the fed
PYPL only needs to be 250 end of January for me to be good on these calls. Guess I'll get to state at red for awhile.

Imagine being in a relationship where you have to go to online forum for thoughts instead of just fucking bringing it up directly to her and discussing it like normal adults

Anyway, calls on your relationship. Just bring it up. Dont be a pussy. Getting engaged isnt something that should come as a surprise. Both parties should be well aware of it before proposing.

My gf has been egging me for like a fuckin year now and im thinking about giving in and proposing. Your gf shouldve been giving you hints already if shes ready
Yeah hype for PPI # for sure. Currious to see if they are bullish af based on job #
F
If Brainard gets the fed chair position, rates are going up to 32% instantly.
They only matter when you look back at them.
One more reason to marry her…..she don’t like getting ripped off!
Clov was so sad, played it cuz I thought they’d beat ER, and the trash still took a shit, didn’t lose $ but what a waste of time.
Lol he’s been holding cash for over a year and adding to it for the eventual crash, but we’re still going up. Just don’t buy any leaps and don’t over extend
He’s over at porn hub
market is forward looking.
You get a snek for that!
Yeah if you had intel. But the plays back then that were considered spec like amazon turned out to be the best performers over the next 20 years. Also, a tech crash then doesn’t matter as much as it would now. Tech is today as manufacturing was in the 1900s
He’s definitely more hawkish, even came out today and said inflation was problematic
Jpow is warning of market crash so Biden is scared of what might happen to this fake market if he replaces him 😎
That’s spelled Lael Brrrrrainard to you good sir!
futures
I like those odds
As a mexican i agree with this message
Personal risk tolerance : *infinite*
Odds are Elon dumping Wednesday just to fuck w RIVN &amp; Jeff Bezos. He’s that petty
Jpow is just giving us a buying opportunity. Jpow giveth, and giveth, and giveth. Maybe be like just a tiny bit patient before you dive all in with calls at open. But also remember that people have been waiting for like 3 weeks for this dip…
Dove
&gt; Yes, we will.
She’s a fucking eagle. Let alone hawkish
Jpow affirmation news tomorrow Spy 472
Red futures are going to accelerate overnight but this is not a bad thing. Market needs to pull back and establish a floor. Glad I'm riding puts down this time around.
Only have Venmo

Enjoy!

Edit: sorry WSB is rubbing off on me. Good luck on your play. I don’t think I’ll join you. Take care.
Yes. Or no.
So are we gonna have different metaverses now? Like one from Microsoft, google, etc. idk it’s all actually wild when you think about what this means
Seriously- this shit stock needs to die. Worst earnings call ever…just vague enough about everything
&gt; We all shit on Cramer because he's a fucking idiot.
She was supposed to be like 60 in Vikings.
[deleted]
She is manly enough to man the printer
Why do we all shit on Cramer all the time again?
My puts would like that
Good reasoning. I don't care about the environment either.

Not if Pelosi has something to say about it.
I’ll make the same bet and eat your wifes ass too
Compared to JPOW where does Brainard land on the hawk-dove spectrum? I personally think Powell's work as fed chair may usher in a new era of economic enlightenment and I'd love for him to keep the role but if we could get someone even more dovish I feel like it would be pretty cool to see the USA really sink our teeth into some Modern Money Theory as we are basically the ideal country to really go for it
Just heard a Fidelity Youth advertisement when I was driving. That’s almost the most bearish contra indicator I personally know

Yeah, I wish they missed. I have puts too
I want to make a bet. UP runs to $14 after earnings. If it doesn’t , I’ll eat my wife’s ass.

Lol remember how all the bears thought today would be the day TSLA limit down? Lmao stupid bears. Tomorrow is the day we limit down.

Brainard is the 🌈est 🐻 out there
SPY works for fds because it has insane volume for an ETF, which is specifically because the s&amp;p is used as a market benchmark and lots of companies correlate to it, or a ratio of it. There's a lot of signal, but also a lot of noise. Hard to distinguish when you're playing with confirmation bias. I think a continuation up is likely, but more from a mechanical standpoint than anything. We dropped 5% in a month and haven't quite caught back onto that trendline yet (it shifted right). Mean reversion being what it is, we're going to see it catch up, overextend, and come back down (oscillating around the mean as it dampens the effect over time). That will happen unless there's something big that causes the whole thing to phase shift again. Tomorrow is going to be interesting.

Burry net worth is over $300M , TSLA puts he bought $500k or less. That is &lt;0.1666666% of his net worth and his treasury bond position made him millions.

I think it's a hyper growth stock that simply suffered after earnings because few want to hold it in a high inflationary environment unless they blew the doors off. But why do you think they're worth so much?
Yeah and everyone hates DoorDash, so watch it fly, hopefully into the ground.
Yeah it runs 12% in one day and then continues to close higher the next two days WHAT A TRASH STOCK.

The person who holds the call options obligation has to acquire shares on the open market price and provide them to Elon at the strike price...
Let’s talk about it captain
Yeah I argued the same at one point. We're given very little information about the stock market as retailers. Most of the time, it's textbook adverse selection at play. There's a reason daytraders scrape for pennies on the dollar and use insane amounts of leverage to do so with targets, stop losses and try to just hit more wins than losses. It's cause we don't really know shit about fuck.
Fuck that moth
&gt; It's not a good idea to play stocks in this market.
I think you should just bring it up, if you love her lol. Seems pretty straight forward to me, I mean obviously she isn't treating you weirdly over it or something so it sounds like your in luck.
Are there any stocks to play if this build back better actually passes?
That’s because people are realizing that companies with most unique and innovative tech always outgrow their competitors and predictions. Nvda deserves its premium and can easily grow into a trillion dollar company with a 20pe

4. TA shows an upwards trend will start

5. No taper/interest rates till potentially next year

6. Nov/Dec/Jan most bullish months

Take your pick here, but SPY gonna keep running.

Keep driving on. Watch their actions, not their words.
Can’t wait for the market crash in 2042
of course, it's an easy drop. You think she wouldn't get down on person she really likes on the first day of visit? Come on man
Prob not enough to drop huh?
Yes.
signs of a degenerate market: look up NVDA price targets, its a "strong buy" with a  20% downside, cuz no one figured it would do what it just did lol.

Just become more fuckable. The bar isn’t that high for women to sleep with you.
I wonder how that works. Like does a Market Maker have to go in the open market and buy them at today’s prices then “sell” 100 shares for $700 for each contract. Lol. Thats so fucked. Or are these shares already acquired and just locked up until he decided to exercise or sell the calls? Either way thats nuts!
Nah, the show goes on
That's another way to say you use RH.

Went to a wedding this weekend with my girlfriend for one of her best friends. I’ve expressed to her before that I want to marry her and be with her forever. Took a shuttle back to hotel and I was drunk as fuck, probably most drunk I’ve been in 7 years. Vaguely remember asking if she knew how much the brides ring was and then saying about how the 3 months salary for me is like 13k. Also vaguely remember her saying that’s way too much but I don’t know how to bring it up in conversation again

I mean, he might turn out to be right and SPY does keep going up, but his premise here is the same as it was last time. He sees moderate to high OI on deep OTM calls, insists that it has to be someone with insider info or “Why else would they drop so much money on calls?!” and talks like it’s a guarantee that the contract will print because OI is high. Before he was saying he thought they were Pelosi’s calls and he kept spamming about “Never bet against Pelosi!” even though he had zero evidence. Now he’s saying it’s insiders from the Fed.

Like yeah eventually his contracts will print if he keeps doing this but that doesn’t make his basic premise correct. Long term if he keeps buying SPY options based almost entirely on high OI he will realize it’s not a consistent indicator of an option printing. The market burns people all the time.
Drop it. Sunk cost fallacy is a thing bro
Ban bet bitch
I'm not saying you're right or wrong. For simplicity's sake, I think you're right, but other possibilities do exist. I think there's a lot of information we don't have, but Virtue of some of these insane quant strategies that the nerds cook up and backtest for decades before implementing. That's all proprietary, and so we have asymmetrical information, even with a bloomberg terminal. There could be a number of companies they're selling straddles on and they're using SPY as an asymmetrical abstraction for their cumulative position in a hedge, while they've sold short to cover the other side (which we'd never really know). 

Tl;dr: I am thinking SPY is coming up for the same reasons, but your 6 data points are hardly a match for whatever is really going on in the background.

I’m trying to buy all the natural aphrodisiacs and max out my sexual energy. I’m then gonna transmute this energy into making portfolio rekting trades.

Sleeping 8-9 hours a day. It’s about to be epic.
Crazy theory. Hack was done by one lone guy around 19, just to test his skills.  He died  5 months later in a car crash, and since nobody could figure out his password, the hard drive was thrown in the trash a couple years later.

I think I'm too retarded to really make an educated statement, my friend. My positions are based solely on the fact that "sToNk oNlY gOEs Up", SPY is a relatively strong performer, and november/december look to be historically bullish months.
What stay at home stocks are there? Looking to buy puts
I don’t know man. It looks to me like it ran into a stiff sell wall. I’m long on spy so I’m praying you’re right but my confidence is crumbling right now. Hopefully I’ll wake up to you rubbing it in my face.

With how much SPY has been going up the past few weeks, it's either go flat for a week and go up more or drop down before bouncing back up. Either way, SPY 500 is inevitable. Personally, I'd rather see a drop to get cheaper calls.
Alright who bought 2,356@16.08 puts for nvda exp 1/21

Dude I was about to buy PYPL calls a couple weeks ago. So I went to check out the chart and I noticed something about the price... I noticed the fact that PYPL was back at its Nov 2020 level.

Here's my order from last year:

PYPL 2020-Nov-13 220 Call
BTO 10 @ 1.65 Limit DAY

so with that I decided fuck PYPL.

godspeed to you retard.
1. 22K volume ahead of PPI numbers on 510C 12/31

2. Insane random buy orders on SPY

3. Last time there were huge random buy orders ahead of taper meeting, SPY took an Addy IR 100 MG

4. TA shows an upwards trend will start

5. No taper/interest rates till potentially next year

6. Nov/Dec/Jan most bullish months

Take your pick here, but SPY gonna keep running.
Yeah it works if your dca shares are less than the strike and your premium collected + assignment = greater than x100 shares sold at strike. 

*bb $8.5 call premium $280
$8.5 x100 + 280 = $1,130*

So you’ll need to have 100 shares of blackberry at $11.29 dca or less to profit
Wish I was in your shoes . What do you think about 11/22 471 calls
Lots of good news out on TSLA today, don’t think this will be a downtrend that’s going to to last long

Autopost every day.
So today when I saw SKLZ start running I fomo'd into 11/12 12c. At one point they were worth 200% of what I paidd for them. I was forced to hold onto them til tomorrow cause I've been flagged as a pattern day trader. Same thing has happed in the past week with intraday SPY puts. I buy them, they print, but im forced to hold them til the next day. It sucks being a poor.
He's not necessarily wrong either. SPY is used in so many ways, but it's also used in the regular way.

Doesn't even qualify as earnings. It should be called the quarter billion losing calls. I don't give 2 fucks if it beat estimates. They are so far fromaking money and acting like taking some dogshit corn is a positive take even more credibility  away from their MLM scheme.
Okay

I loved how everything was apparently priced in today except the things that should have been lol
Dude lol you’re fine what’s the strike?
Yep
holding 12/6 467c and 12/9 475c. feeling nervous but also confident that they're long enough to at least be semi profitable by next week.

This is gonna be one of them bullshit "flat and barely red, with practically no volume" weeks, isn't it?
This more than coke. This McDonald’s Sprite.
The best part is that this will continue throughout fall and winter.  Also, sometime next year, just when you start to see the light appear before work, it is March and Daylight Savings time pulls the rug and you are once again stuck with even more dark mornings.
I'm not saying that's what's going on, just that it's a possibility. Also, they're not necessarily hedging *SPY* puts, or puts at all. They could be hedging puts, or even short positions elsewhere in a company heavily correlated to SPY. There's all kinds of high level degeneracy with options that we can't even imagine. The Barclays trading strategy comes to mind.

Yeah if that initial deposit of 10k bounces, you can’t withdraw, even if it is higher then 10k.

Look man I have 11/19 472c’s right now and I want it to be green tomorrow too and hopefully PPI report is bullish but your whole thesis here is fucking retarded make believe nonsense
Sorry you feel bad. Take a break. We all need one occasionally
Ayyyyeeeeee!!!! Lessss gooo!!!
Riot $60 tomorrow
tbh.. trade. Maybe electrical or mechanical. Not HVAC because fuck it.... and a big +1 if you can stomach being a plumber, probably make just as much as electrical.
150 million american (including myself) were compromised during the leak. They're gonna have a bad time if they start using my info to start a new credit

America is rich as fuck dude. 8% of Americans are millionaires. But because someone bought 500k of calls you think the most likely explanation is it’s definitely someone with insider info? Come on dude

I am also praying we open big green but this is like the exact same, EXACT same rationale you were using to say that your 10/15 450c’s were gonna print. Eventually you are gonna realize that somewhat high OI on SPY doesn’t really mean anything. People make big bets on it all the time, that doesn’t always mean they’re gonna pay out

“Coast Guardsman Clifford Johnson went back inside the building no fewer than four times in search of his date who, unbeknownst to him, had safely escaped. Johnson suffered extensive third-degree burns over 55% of his body but survived the disaster, becoming the most severely burned person ever to survive his injuries at the time. After 21 months in a hospital and several hundred operations, he married his nurse and returned to his home state of Missouri. Fourteen years later he burned to death in a fiery automobile crash.”

Not angry at all bro. Never held a position in Tesla Stock. The car is shit, past 2 wks I realized they have little to no advantage in “AI” compared to Lucid + 3rd AI car services. I just hope Tesla doesn’t tank the market. It’s downfall is already written as soon as people figure out it literally has no advantage.

I think it is for a short term play at least. I tried to get a bunch of shares at IPO and didn't get any allocated (would have sold at 34 same day), grabbed a bit when it dropped to 27, and then doubled down at 23. Feel like with options trading it might have a decent pop. Probably sit on the shares for that pop or a month. I'll give up on the play if it drops to 20.

I’m taking a shower soon. Anyone want to join me? No homo but ladies? I’ll bring the body wash and shampoo and even a clean towel you just bring that body gurrrrl

Wel I was wrong look like a simpleton on Tesla I kept the morning calls before ten I’m gonna just ride it out
That would be pretty neat
with a P/E ratio of 500,  TSLA is a buy
Just need VIX to spike to 65 or so, then I can retire.

has anyone figured out what PLTR actually does
PLTR is going to beat on revenue and and earnings, jump to $29, then fall to $24 eow, then trade sideways for two months. Fuckin thetagang.
Wait you can go broke that way
Almost went calls deep in AMD puts either before close. Glad I took an impromptu nap while waiting and missed that.
I fucked your mother. And that’s on the record.
RUDE MAN WHO SHUSHES, PLEASE CALL
Just tell it to me straight, how fucked are my tsla calls expiring in 3 weeks
Loaded up
Get out of those DIS calls ASAP
Can’t make this up, if the market had opened the way futures are pointed I’d be up 60k today instead we pumped and theta gangbanged me out of 15k
It was my big play a year ago.  Worst buy ever.  Made like 50 cents.  And at the time I was picking apple or Tesla.  Fawk!
should I hold on to my Zynga puts or sell at open?
Why do futures tease Bears every night? They've been through enough. Don't kick them while they're down
Too much autism in one place is dangerous
Bulls are so fucked 🧸🐂🪓
I got 12.47 in buying power, what does that get?
Still very bullish . Bears fuked . Bear wife no longer with mr bear .
I did buy a TSLA share for $420.69 which gave me like $5k back so I'm probably not actually down $10k but it's in a different account so I'm not counting it
TSLA weekly condors with $20 gaps from 1140 to 1090. I'm okay if it never gets to 1140, but of it goes below 1090 I'm gonna be grr.
Just tried to see what rates I'll get from RKT, absolutely garbage.
This means RKT will profit the fuck of those idiots using its service, RKT 🚀

It means big money loading up Puts bigly

Time to exit was today I hope I can salvage what I can tomorrow

I am not a bear just felt it was time to hedge. Market is due to fuck me over I just get that feeling
Are they public?
&gt; I'm not sure.
That company's $ situation looked super shitty. I don't understand why anyone would be buying into that. 

That being said I didn't have the testicles for long puts on it either.

Correction????
What you guys drinking tonight?
I capitulated and sold half my puts at a big loss today and bought the dip.  Fully expecting a -2% day now that I've unwound like 70% of my hedge.
It was just a day trade. I bought it when it was worth very little, and sold it when it was worth more.
VMod confirmed.

I pulled a “Gordon Charley” playing SPY today.
&gt; What if rblx went down and stayed? How is that any different lol?

Here are two things that apply to options but not to shares:

* https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp

* https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/theta.asp

But maybe those things don't matter and everyone should just buy options all the time, especially right before earnings. That's definitely the move.
Who would have thought that a ring could plug a hole...
Illegal actually. Someone is about to fall on a bullet.
It’s ok 👍 , I had to literally look at the equation to make sense of it, and read several articles. Not to mention there are also multiple equations, all of which have been updated, and some are scraped completely.

5% drop in a month is no longer possible in this type of market. It'd be tough to see anything close to 2% these days. Minor dips are seen as Black Friday sales and are quickly bought up.

Will likely continue for the rest of the year. Next year, I don't know.

I see what you mean, I had interpreted it as winning a fight without fighting. Like the 🐻 💃🏻 on no catalyst. 

But it means to cease fighting, or to roll over
LCID has to eventually drop, right? Can’t keep this trend… it’s retarded. I need to buy puts
Plant your twolips

Pussies.

I feel
Your pain. I bought pre earnings last time around 77 and sold at 93 and felt like a genius. I am a true asshole
Whereas bears will have one good week of wins from a 5% drop that fund the next 3 months of losses. 

Perfectly balanced, as all things should be

Why would you go all in on calls when the market has been green basically every day for a month. SPY up 8% over 30 days
God damn visual mod. I should get this on a t-shirt for the next time I think the gods are out to get me, when in reality I just gambled a ton of money on some retarded OTM calls.
Who's dick do I need to suck tonight for PLTR to moon tomorrow?
Paperhands selling before bullish PPI numbers. Trust me.
Why two weeks out?
I just need a healthy 5% this month that’s not to much to ask
They’ve been working overtime on PTON and others. They’re gonna go light on indexes tonight
It's fine to short TSLA, just gotta make sure the second you're up just 1 cent in profit, consider selling.

Ok dweeb you will never be close to one piece man
less than 0.5% dip is now a big deal I guess
To the WSB community who buys spy puts during the most bullish months what’s your logic? Is it a tax right off?

That's pretty fucky. Corporate forced "inclusion" that actually just singles out minorities? Imagine a room full of scrawny white dudes talking about being Irish, Swedish, Italian, Polish and whatever other variety of white their cheating grandmas told them they were, and then you have each of them talking about whatever native tribe they have ancestry in... and then you have like a single black dude just cringing the entire time like 

"I don't fucking know what country my ancestors come from. That's some weird white privelege shit". 

Then Jimmy the dude with one leg and vitiligo gets up there and has to talk about things that are probably hard to talk about. Shit he used to get made fun of for. 

I'm sure this will all go swimmingly.
You’d be owning PLTR

I don't think it'll last long (at least I hope not) but they crafted it to be aimed at the visually impaired. I'm not sure why a blind person would ever need to know my race but hey, that's how woke we are right now
I gotta say this Green Day saved my bacon
As long as your stuff expires two weeks out sure
Why not cut your loss there?

Very fucked. Sold my $1200 for Dec 21 cuz it's fucked
At least he’s not a bag holder /s

Lol that’s how I feel about TSLA right now 🤦‍♂️
SPY ran 9% in under a month. Might pull back 1% then run another 9% by EOY. 

Bears can't beat the Fed.
Best way to live. I like numbers not material things
That is kind of a goofy statement. How old is chair Powell? 70?
In my dreams, I’m life or death situations, I can always seem to sprint for long long distances to gtfo of certain situations. 


Which tells me how fucked I’d be if it happened in real life
Red day tomorrow confirmed

This was a sign

What was your return?
Will print
Late 2022 I’d fuck with it
Toss some puts in for a quick hedge if you got in at $7, since they’re only monthlies I could see myself taking a few Nov $12.5p and just flipping them and sell the $10p later. 

The news on that acquisition was what made me bullish on them. We got your genome, now we do telemedicine and a delivery pharmacy…. 

Barring some data leak where they say everyone’s genome is now on the dark web, long term hold for me at this point
Well my calls were down $4k today so I sold considering they expire 10/12
People have been saying this for months and months and it still has never held gains. It’s down by almost 3 percent over the last 6 months bro
Loaded up on bntx , my calls better print hard
I'm already out $1k because I couldn't go short in the $1200's last week.
Great Dio Ref!
Warning to all newbies: don’t fuck with the mouse
Can't figure out if this group has been a net gain for me. On one hand I've learned tons about the market and made some good investments but on the other I've lost like $10k although I feel confident I'll make it back

I slowly realized that today  

Shame I went hard on 160c this week
I got greedy n I’m scared
Not me. There's still a ton of things I want buy. Did you know you can buy your own golf course for around a million bucks? Not a great course or anything, but you could buy it, keep it operating just the way it was, but perpetually have your own Saturday 9am tee time reserved. And fuck it, 8:50 and 9:10 so you have a buffer. Play as fast or slow as you want.
They watch squid game in their huge  theater room while checking wsbs and eating popcorn
Then thinking about all the losses that could’ve gone to tendies.
Im beginning to think selling those CCs on MARA was a mistake 🤦‍♂️
Will be adding 20 contracts to my 215s if it looks weak at open. Bearish flow indicates that it may go to 210 with enough volume.
That’s when you sell lol 😂 🤡🤡🤡

Accumulating cash for Rivian IPO. Cybertruck is ugly as shit.

That’s completely ridiculous. It’s 13 year olds!!
They can barely handle orders during market hours 🤡
Just trying to help you make the big bucks but whatever you want man hope you enjoy your uranium calls
You remember that PINS fud?
Vix spiked do to puts being bought today, it will taper over the next few days and level out, if it doesn’t then you can dance
Respectable ah selloff on spy and qqq. Futes could get a little turbulent tonight

Mouse really took offense to analysts making fun of its plus numbers huh
Do any brokers have TSLA shares available for short?

Fucking TD won't allow free money plays.
There wasn't so much fud. PYPL actually lowered their targets for next year. Furthermore, while PYPL hit on EPS, they missed on revenue.
Link?
Why is it that every poster who claims to have "just yolo'd into CLOV" has a post history showing they've been bagholding it for months?  
  
Is it because they know it's a shitty PnD stock and they need to do whatever they can to astroturf it, because they know it isn't going to go up on the companies performance?
Lmao imagine believing these futures aren't fake and gay
I’m interested in creating a large position in PYPL. What strategy would you recommend? Buy straight shares, buy far ITM calls and then sell OTM calls? So many options and I’m somewhat new. Just need a strategy
Subway is gross 🤮
That’s not the truth, dumb ass.  I’m not even in it, but I have fuckin eyes.  All that stock does is go up.
Very true. I got in at $7 a share but I haven’t really seen a bad day since. Like every stock it has had it’s good days and bad but it hasn’t been bad for awhile. We shall see!!! 🙃

They be chillin just like everyone else. They just eat better food more often.
Here we go of course you would use a “implied volatility of a hypothetical option” on the s&amp;p. 

Reference [here](https://www.macroption.com/vix-calculation/)

We all know, or maybe not, that the VIX HAS two equations, one of which is majorly flawed the other which favors options heavily. 

So if you see an influx of just puts bought of course the VIX will spike, but taper in the preceding days if none are further bought. Ergo VIX is only good if used for say a prolonged period of time, i.e several weeks because it calculates time into its equation.


Tldr : can’t use VIX for this week just because of today
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Nope, double down at open. Pussy
Where'd you get this from?
BLNK &amp; EVGO CALLS OVERNIGHT
Because QQQ isnt going up? to add to this I believe it could be due to the underlying stock allocation in the QQQ fund is largely made up of $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $TSLA and $GOOG which none had really good days, TSLA sank 4.84%, AMZN dropped 0.85% and AAPL dropped 0.5%, FB (sorry mb "meta") also dropped 0.74% yesterday. Whilst yeah I agree, the semiconductor sector did very well yesterday with AMD increasing 10.14% and INTC rebounding 1.24% from Earnings release a few weeks ago, NVDA also went up 3.54%. Sorry for the long post of just listing stock changes but I think it shows why QQQ doesn't go up when alot of underlying stocks in it go crazy in 1 day is because its less allocated to the semiconductor sector.
lmao, stay your dumbass in /CLOV
No. But thats the truth it tanks at open
😍
First we buy far OTM calls, then put them on the grill,  then we watch them go  -99%.
Well if we open at 471 I will gladly sell my calls at market open.
Maybe I should stop smoking 😂 I meant 370
It's looking awfully red. I'm worried for my calls
I think if I had big money I would probably live a similar way I do now, just carefree. Maybe a couple indulgences here and there. It would just be an amazing feeling of safety
So what's causing pypl to be like this. Even FB recovered from its fud.
They’re fake and gay

I was planning on buying puts on Roblox, even if earnings as I assumed they would, I'm still surprised it went up as it did. As for Dash, I'd also like that confirmation bias, I could argue how people prefer going to restaurants as restrictions are getting lifted and how they are a one trick pony vs Uber, and how people don't want to work as drivers for anything. But who knows, I'll stick to my puts but I've been wrong in the past

They said in their last earnings call they expect revenues to decline further you cuck
Oh
I'm looking at January calls
&gt; The most important thing to know about life is that you are not special.
Yeah selling my 4 AMD calls on Friday (would have expired this Friday) for a very small gain made me angry today. Missed out on at least 5k.
is this call like your tennis shoes?
I mean to say we gonna see huge loss porn soon
I'm gonna be honest. Im kind of retarded
LOLOLOL, now that my options expired worthless you go ITM? 12k fucking pissed away, Jesus Christ fuck you spy!

Considering $50,000 bet on $PYPL.

+5% to -5% in after hours, and this stock is now below its 20 day SMA for only the 2nd time in 5 years on the 5 year chart.  Below 100 SMA on the 3 year chart for just the 2nd time as well.  The 1st time for both being COVID crash in March 2020.

Extremely oversold, and new partnership announced today with Amazon to make Venmo a payment option.  I’m calling a $215 bottom here.

Always a great idea to short one of the hottest stocks in the hottest industries after they inked a massive deal with one of the largest companies in the world
SDC has a gap that needs to be filled, bullish 🤡
Assuming TSLA holds up and can get back over 1200 and stay there for a few weeks, then before EOY

Really?

Nice DD but your put is going to be burned
Let the dust settle tomorrow
bad bitches go in the morning
Stupid fuck
I don’t tell my girlfriend about my trading. That way she doesn’t love me for the money and can’t hate me for the losses
No I am a seasoned bag holder sir
Whatever it was, it must have been super convincing for her to go in on a children’s gaming app. Shows these companies are serious about pulling it off.

UPST doesn’t have a bank keeping loans for themselves, which was a big driver in LC beat. If I play UPST it will be puts. Valuation demands huge growth numbers and I think their forward guidance will be lacking.
Just wait bro Elon will tweet again and we'll be green maybe idfk bro just pray alright we in this together
Must be why it only goes down
Maybe go to yahoo and see what the vibe is and decide whether to keep your position?

right, I feel like with people getting out now, they have to have missed the mark right??
Visa and MasterCard had bad earnings every single fintech company missed earnings because nobody is spending money right now, data shows we are at a peak record number of money in people’s saving accounts, will all change for the holiday season, don’t worry
I agree. It’s also the least toxic place on Reddit. Like everyone is super chill and just vibes well.

November is historically decent
It hurts because it's universally true.
This is killing me. So many longs feel like free money. Seems like at least a few relatively mainstream stocks are making 30% moves every week. There are jack pots all around. It's fun but sucks when you barely miss it. Either by selling too early or failing to execute in time.

Could be argued greed is nearing an ATH but make hay while the sun shines 

Godspeed! The week has begun

Next week, not this week.
I sold 5 calls in MILE this afternoon, so you are definitely right. It will fly.
I do inverse WSB. I was here all weekend telling everyone SPY wasn’t going to do anything due to the infra deal, that it was already priced in. We’re sideways this week and then probably down next. Week after thanksgiving we’ll most likely start pushing towards $500
My wife was just trying to use the hand attachment on the carpet cleaner. It wasn't working right and she asked, "Why isn't it sucking?" I responded... because its married. Puts on me getting laid tonight.

Diamond hand that shit
If I had to guess, its probably someone tipping her off about the metaverse being a huge play in the future. I say this cause she has a sizeable position in FB, MSFT &amp; NVDA which are companies that play an important part of building up the metaverse infrastructure and software. 

The only portion she was missing was gaming, which I think would really kick-off the whole metaverse world and would be the instant thing ppl see value in (apart from porn). I would have personally went with Unity as theyre likely big players in standing up the building blocks of the meta gaming world but I guess Roblox has its place and has a proven network of existing players.
How could you sell your calls after hours?

yea…. I don’t think any of those are gonna print
I'm poor too, it feels like I will be able to make A LOT more when I hit 25k
I hit like 30k again maybe like a few months after it’s honestly happened a few times to me (my account is blown right now only about 1.8k) but I’ve hit a few times I got some of the positions on my profile all the way back but hopefully again real soon lmao. This is also why I believe in doing this all the time everyday because I know you can really take a little money and make it life changing off options sometimes.
My coin and Nvidia call swings looks like it gonna pay off nicely

Amc I hope you at least wipe the jizz off my back when you’re done
Maybe it will bounce in the morning
Don’t they give away our data anyway
Who else is this balls deep w me?

15 SPY $475C 11/10

1 SPY $485C 11/19 (rolling over 475C here)

41 SPY $500C 12/31

35 SPY $530C 1/21/2022
Only thing going down is your karma g
So, what are the chances it happens again?
RBLX call holders FU and good job, PYPL put holders wow you mofo's are brilliant, imagine being right or lucky on top of that Amazon related news, trying to buy that POS Pins put a curse on the stock.
So tempting dude
That game is over for now
Roblox missed revenue by 69% 😏
PYPL leaps tomorrow
SPY is my core everything, and my main calls are out to Mar in it… hopefully $470 and 📈
META is stupid cheap now, volume is picking up daily and AUM has increased ~50% in a couple weeks 🤷🏻‍♂️
…we’ll see, we’re all fishing here
Go with F
I like how this dude rests his head on my chest after he’s finished servicing me
Can Apple move 🆙?

You realize that the money you’d have lost in a hard correction would basically be the money you made during this insane bull run right?
#HOW YOU BROKE FUCKS DOIN?
[deleted]
Bots are people to.
😂
🌽 fomo is starting get in before IV is 300%
I wonder if it's worth it to open a CC position on RBLX at open tomorrow.
I’d be happy with 165
GME is up nearly 9% on the week and 25% on the month, it’s a lot closer than you think
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/jerseynate (0/1) made a bet that FB would go to 300.0 when it was 333.19 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Help this retard understand pls
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Loaded up at open let's go
Everyone’s feeling a little bearish
Beautiful views from pasatiempo, smoking a blunt.
This is probably the most dangerous play in the market right now considering how high the stock is. A good earnings beat it will trend up a little but a miss will send this absolutely tanking IMO.

Good luck though
Fucking COIN and UPST
Hopefully it'll make you a very happy ape
F - FORD… LFG!!!
I did on puts 🤡🤡🤡🤡
You dropped this *picks up tinfoil hat*
AMC original cup noodles

Theater: slurp slurp slurp
Cry me a river.
Never touched it never will I’m done with  Anything Schamath touches don’t care if I could make money
Her family hails from Italy. Wouldn't be surprised if she or her family has ties to the Mafia.
Agreed. Rivian might pump from the hype but it's gonna crash and burn up until they at least sell some trucks and deliver them. Right now it's just an idea and a proof of concept.
Roblox. Damn
Expect the unexpected, unfortunately for you I have calls which means this shit is gonna drop 30% like AMRS did today
I'm convinced Apple won't hit 175 by Christmas 🙁
Bought puts today
Yesssir. 16.5 C 12/3.
stfu shill self promoting fuck
Forgot when I placed the banbet but yeah. Banned for sure and 10k unrealized gone 🤡
Riot pumping AH

NVDA pumping AH 

And I have calls on both 😎
I’m going to do some LEAPS.
God speed my good sir
Well it certainly feels like a global economic collapse is imminent
Nah you’re fucked bro.
A shitter day is due
You laugh but the weekly and monthly charts are getting a laugh too, imagine seeing all the shit this past week and not thinking it’s setting up for big tendies. Do you though
Here we have it boys, another genZ turd who thinks they know the market inside and out. You dont know shit so go back to your inbreed family and keep producing more apes.
SPCE pls fly
[deleted]
It need to test the low of 3.74 -$4
You’re not gonna make retirement money if you never invest it, just saying. Literally missed out on 35% gains if you were in SPY the past year
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
LYV can fall harder than this.
You’re just mad of how much Clov did you dirty in the past
UPST earnings tomorrow please give us an upward breakout hulk dick 🥵📈
Was up 1,000$ for like a minute now I'm down 1,000$, right after announcing a partnership with Amazon and Walmart before the holiday season... crazy !
So FOMO into fake internet money? Should have  pulled trigger on MARA calls…
They let you double once fairly easy then they take it all on the second or third try. It’s a feature not a glitch!
“And the red sun rises!”
AMC shareholders: how can we move the business towards profitability?

Everyone: …

CEO: Popcorn 🍿
Such a waste of capital. Retards can stay retarded longer than you can stay solvent. Don’t revenge trade dumb memes, buy real companies and make bank.
At 8$? The last time it was so low was 2013, it march 20 the lowest was 9$
What play did you make? Maybe theres still hope
i'll be here for a few days but once my knees and wrists are tired out I'll have to go back to buying calls
What you think SPY opens at tomorrow?
40 at 0.25 each. Not the end of the world or anything. I was just trying to get my free $1000 bucks. Theta gang taking the L on this one.

Edit: I wanted to add that I plan on rolling them out to 4p s if I can. Whatever the earliest date is where I will get a credit to roll them. I could assignment and turn the wheel, but I like rolling my options instead.
It made me happy last week, I paperhanded and took the profits
I really just can’t wait until 25 k for unlimited day trades (I know I’m a broke ass mf) I had 50k once and ofc went balls deep into PLTR calls and lost it the next couple days.
Spy green 8 days in a row. Fake and gay futures. Up 2% tomorrow! Spy 490 eow.
[deleted]
The EV company they own 12% of has an IPO tomorrow and you think the top is in?? Get the fuck outa here
Long ass Put leaps? Just short the stock if you’re that bearish
dash puts???
looks primed and ready, I'm excited.
Dam it feels good to be a gangster.

-Pelosi, probably
I did too but bought more on the dip. Couldn’t help it ha ba
Bulls know it's overvalued too, kek.
Same here bro but I was able to sell when it hit $243
Lol💩🗑
My obligatory SPY calls 🚀🚀 …don’t know about y’all, but I’m rocking some META calls too.  The metaverse ETF.  📈🚀![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Locked and loaded dude.
Lol
Smile puts probably still won’t print if it doesn’t dip couple more percent given it had 25% implied volatility lol
They had a shitty earnings
I will fomo into Riot and Mara calls tomorrow am and get destroyed.
It’s going to take a while buddy
🖐
brrr- ah fuck
200% ez
Ford gonna be 21 by open
All the indicators I'm looking at say we're due for a pullback.  That being said they are still just guesses.  I think 1-3% this week.  I'm in cash right now and it's boring AF.
Idk, I called a pull back like a week ago. Then proceeded to yolo on calls. Every time I look at technicals and I predict spy is going to really correct it just drops a dollar or so then hits a new all time high. Should it? Technicals say so, will it? I don’t fucking know because nothing makes sense.
RIOT $80 is no longer a meme
I think it could go up

But it may also go down
Opened weekly 460/515 bear credit spread today.
Who the fuck uses PayPal anymore now that eBay sucks donkey cock? 

I don’t get it….
I sold my nvda calls at open and bought amd.
Who is this Nancy you speak of?
Couldn't have said it better. I'm watching around while everyone's having fun at the party for an entire year. Feels like I missed out big but then again I rationalize it for myself that it's hard to hold onto money once you've made it, and so easy to lose it all. 

Just waiting for the big dip until I die
&gt; Yes, I recommend buying NFLX.
I bought a shit ton for my 409k
Everyday i feel happy that I don’t have kids I trade away my life savings too often
Ok😂
Watch F and RIVN fucking moon
is there a NFLX play with disney earnings on Wednesday?
Just think of it as selling earlier than you would've liked.
RISE MY CORN. RIIIISEEEE
so theta gang basically? have u done it before?
Where my bers at?

Spy is overvalued
$PINS why you no go up
if you have $500k in shit and $20k in cash so you can jump in on a random play I'd say thats worth it. if you got like $500 it's obviously not.
If it moons ima buy a bed from them so I can fuck the hedge fund managers mother on it
Listening to 311 right tf now in honor of NVDA.
Stop posting serious stuff.
Don’t tell VisualMod, but you’re my favorite bot on this sub
Do you really think it’s just going to stay cheap forever lmao. That’s not how this works
amc is such a pathetic company jeeeesus. wish i had the balls to buy 2024 luts and wait
By 9:30
Wtf 240 to 220
Who had that screen grab of Pelosi buying a small country’s worth of shares of RBLX. I LOLd at the time but now I just wanna know what she buys next
Amc had shitty earnings. I know guys they lost less money but still 240 million
This was the dip
Unity makes up a big chunk of the engine behind all this metaverse garbage. I will be very unhappy if we don’t get a nonsensical “metaverse” pump this week and everyone’s like “oh, yea. Obviously” after the fact.
Haha sucks nerd
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Paysafe plz plz for the love of Christ
That’s about 10x my account so I’m good lol
Same here and 220 Nvda
You all will be sorry when Clov moons tomorrow
Dip was six months ago
Banbet it
Please hold me tight and tell me my PYPL $260 will be alright
It’s awesome!  You can lie to your kids and tell them it’s bed time.
Damn I picked Pypl over Roblox for calls. Ooof
Relax, I sold TSLA for 500 pre split
Fwiw SIPC tops out at 500k but I get ya
If 160 eow ill be a very happy individual
I feel like there needs to be a Pelosi thread pinned right above the daily moves box lol - idk where to find her trades
PYPL is a buy at these levels
I mean, eventually throwing darts at stock tickers will net a winner

Beginning to cover their asses for when we hit Andromeda. Great time to be a holder. Our time is coming
Cash gang is like being the designated driver. Everyone around you is either having a great time or puking their guts out, but at least they're not sober and bored.
It's all a coin flip
Yeah to 75k atleast timing I dont know so go out to December 17 atleast
At least Michael didn't *take* the highschoolers college money.


*edit:* and then kill them
I have covered calls on MARA stock. I'm a straight 🤡🤡🤡
[deleted]
How do I get so unlucky bullish news with PayPal just to have it free fall.  At least I got shares and not calls 🤷🏼‍♂️
___ r fuk memes aside, how is everyone feeling about a pullback on SPY?

October was unusually strong by historical standards, and the market pumped as hard as ever after the tapering announcement since interest rate remains 0%.


I mean, a handful of solidly red days have to be coming between now and the holidays, right?

hard mode: Answer without brrr.
100% it touched that today, tomorrow will be no different.
So was NVDA and look at that.  Pelosi knows
If you aren't buying CLOV calls tomorrow at market open then woof, I don't even know what to tell you man
I'm holding 2 calls on it currently, I plan to turn those profits into a few shares and hold. Seems like they have a really good product.
😂
Don't look at my account until noon and hope I don't have to kill myself
Anyone else playing MQ earnings on Wed?

I think it is going to be massive beat... with increased guidance.

Just look at [Bill.com](https://Bill.com)... one of their clients... as is AFRM, SQ, UBER, DASH, JPM, GS...

AMC. I picked up a few right at the end of the day when no one seemed to want them. Just seemed to easy, tomorrow will tell.
Yeh my leaps will be in pain tomorrow but I'll avg down a few more times. All good.
I have this weird tingling sensation about NIO tomorrow. That or it's chlamydia
What are *your* moves tomorrow?
I felt so off today. Couldn’t help but take an extended nap.
I can see it now my mother is going to wake me up in the morning with the good news. She’s going to tell me that Pay Pal just hit $1300 per share surpassing Tesla. She tells me we are rich and that I finally made it. Then she tells me that I have to get ready for school but I wait I already graduated what I she talking about. That’s when it hits me I am dreaming and my mother woke me up because I actually pissed the bed again. Damn.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Yeah they need to print
man…. Fuck.
Ik I cant talk about it here, but I was fortunate enough to buy it in 2018, a fucking blessing bro omg.
Redundant
Time for NIO bro while Tesla takes a rest.
Instructions unclear, hand stuck up ass
If everyone thinks so probably not…
fake: talks to girls 
gay: touches dick
Have you seen China stocks lately.
Very inspirational work. Good play
Lol my puts happy
If you asked me a week ago I'd have been happy with 135 EOY. And now you have euphoric weirdos saying it could double and still be undervalued.

The answer is nobody knows, but the market seems to love it, so even if there's a pullback long term I'd call it a buy.
RIOT up 7% ah.
My calls are pleased
I’m a gonna win
Yeah
Who bought SDC?? Let’s see the losses
$1200 Call Tesla 11/26. Literally free money. Ban me for a week if Tesla don’t hit 1200 by then.
Michael Scott: **Promises a group of high schoolers he will pay for them to go to college and then doesn’t fulfill his promise**

Travis Scott: hold my beer
I think it will.
I personally use and love fidelity.
I like their chips
NIO to $60 by 11/19
Earnings = shit, don't cry
I would but the power company turned off the electricity yesterday so it’s always dark. I offered them my flashlight but they misunderstood and thought I said fleshlight. The manager told me “no thanks we got plenty we’re used to fucking ourselves”.
You give them $12k, and they’ll teach you how to sell covered calls.
This is the dip
I sold NVDA for a $1600 loss. If I held 25 days later, I'd be at a gain of $48,000
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/CoolHandsFT (1/3) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1100.0 when it was 1216.7 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Let’s go!
PYPL really shitting the bed ! Need some great PT upgrades in the am 😪
I know if it's circumcised it's Kosher.
So your saving yourself for marriage.
SPY going to 500 overnight - cope
SDC gang will need some dentures after taking a brick to the face
Restoration hardware had a what?
I cant buy the dip on Tesla if it never happens.....come on bears short the thing.
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Zephym (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 440.0 when it was 459.93 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
bbby calls making me horny as fuck
Should have bought more RIOT calls
Opinions on amd? Eod? Eow?
What’s another good options platform? I hate RH but Chuck won’t let me
Try letting her peg you instead. Cut the smalltalk.
should've known, positive news = tank
Is it jizz from the cheap tricks you're turning behind wendys?

fucked up last EOW, and im fucking up again as of today. but missed potential is a bummer 

&amp;#x200B;

still gaining, still paining
I would guess the guy that died in their factory that caused the shutdown could be problematic for them
Yes
Nice maybe in Europe you can but not in the states! We save the little ones for the Canadians
Imagine thinking Spy isn’t Gona keep dumping 🤡
I need to find her trades
I thought they did away with circuit city?
sHoRt LaDdEr AtTaCkS!
imagine the federal government taxing imaginary gains for WSB.... imagine taxing /cryptocurrency imagined gains. We can pay for intergalactic travel
She won’t sell till it’s back at the bottom, she will just buy more tomorrow
Of course MARA moons AH after I paper handed.
Guys I just realized that when I start talking with a girl for a little I no longer want to jerk off
Dang it's been a solid month.

Hope this non stop market continues well after Xmas.
SPY 470C should print by EOW……


Right??
Glad I bought MARA and RIOT calls today
Shorted and puts into earnings? Print print printers everywhere!
I need it
Is dick pic haram?
Well shit.... I thought if they raise the price of pop corn high enough, they will make profit
If we’re talking amc then no. I bought some at $44.6. I like amc but media pushing hard on apes buying amc on earning. You know what the say. Buy the rumor sell the news.
The real question is, what did she know that the rest of us mortals didn’t? She bought in months ago.

It’s exactly what I would do if I could time travel… become a powerful politician and get rich off the stock market.
Yeah booze ain't the answer (well maybe it is I dunno)
Oral always helps
Lose money
NIO about to meme like Tesla these next 10 trading days. Up 50% easy. Expect some bullish China news in the next day or so.
 Because of solar calls. ^^/s
Of all the broads Bald Bezo could have had he chose that one. Fuk

You get an all time high, you get an all time high, everybody gets an all time high!!!!
Fine with me, my puts expire on Friday.
CRON +25% today and still moving AH.
My huang isn't called medication
I also owned amd when it was $15 and swung it a few times to like $18 and forgot about it for two years
Why are you retards crying about it getting dark early? You know you never leave the house
*puts on blonde wig*
I mean, yeah, they could get bad PR for it, but it’s usually within the rights of a business to kick people out (except for things like race). I’m sure they would send someone over to talk to you about it first. But yeah, I could totally see the gym kicking you out if you are walking around with a giant boner all the time and don’t even like tape it down or anything. 

The manager would be like: “there goes boner bob again, scaring the children…” 

They wouldn’t tolerate that for long is my guess, but they might. You never know.
they were like .5 - 1 lb or so. you got 2 that fit on the plate. it was from this place - https://www.yelp.com/biz/london-lennies-rego-park  but it was also 10 years or more ago, so maybe it changed ? I couldn't find it on their menu when I checked just now. it was good enough to remember though.
I’ll shit my pants if it hits 40EOY
Expecting a good er from palantir , gonna start selling at 27.5+ , buy back in around 22/24 in a couple of weeks. It aint much but profit is profit.

Keeping a close eye on MANU, manager about to be sacked, they have a great squad, people back in stadiums and signed Ronaldo to juice up that sweet sweet sponsorship deals. Expect a pop when the new manager gets announced. 

Selling my last bit of SPCE to buy more ndq and rocketlab, might get some puts on spce for early next year @12-15. 

I also like to lick windows and eat crayons so what do I know...
**MCTRAVIS MCSCOTTBURGER**

It’s depressing to me I just hate how it always makes you feel like it’s later lmao
Wish I had RBLX calls rn. Could afford the pretty hooker this weekend instead of ButterFace Maggy
I’ve been seeing these articles for the past year and a half
Relax, I sold NVDA at $220
I don’t think. I trust my vibe

Too bad theres no dip to buy. All her shit is at ATH
Yep, I bought AAL at $8.  I'm just telling you why no one is talking about it.  It's not up much.
Started an oral medication for gambling addiction today.   🙌

Atleast I am looking forward to the day near end of this month/early dec when I make back my $11,000 trading tuition
EV and COIN is all you need this week
The question was what are your moves tomorrow
COIN making solid gains everyday while I’m still kicking myself for losing out my shares to covered calls at $240 😓😓😓 and jumped on ROKU! So stupid of me!
Can't. Got banned lol
He was talking shit to me on the initial pump. Haven’t seen him since
Anyone have the twitter handle for the account that specifically follows Pelosi's trades?
short LYV?
Give me your "guy" number please. I want some of that great stuff
Cathie over trades and that’s why she only wins sometimes, those sometimes can be huge, but Pelosi is a real diamond hander
I swear dude, grandma is the golden goose

Got a PYPL right up my metaass and i may not even care 😳
Where did you see that?
Imaging thinking we aren't opening green. Lmfao.
Must be in the Midwest earlier here
One recommended article title said something like "vet trader warns of bubble, market may fall -80%." Ha, I'd like to see THAT
Where’s the guy who bought PYPL calls
Idk how I feel about this being dark extremely early again thing
I can’t be the only one who bought puts on popcorn today.
Ever release a thunderous fart that smelt so bad paint starting peeling off the walls? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
GG PYPL 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 most stocksmi bought recently in my 401k have been shit 😪😪😪
Just realized Pelosi has roblox calls...I'm just gonna follow her now..
PLTR ripping into earnings.

Will the curse be broken?  Will the blessed Palantards with golden hearts be blessed with what they deserve?  Green into earnings, green coming out?
PayPal needs to buy OnlyFans. That is its last hope
Seeing articles like the Marketwatch one never fail to make me laugh because they age **like dogshit** every. single. time.

Isn’t Cathie heavily in Robocuck? She finally nailed one !

Lol at the pretend balance of power. The supreme court strikes down the eviction moratorium and they just reissue it, and an appeals court puts a stay on the vaccine mandate and the white house says just do it anyway
Is there a reason there's almost always a big dip in AH and slow recovery before PM the next day?
Lol nah
All in 🌽 miners tomorrow
Well there goes my PYPL CALLS 🥲
Because they are a garbage company with garbage earnings.

SDC gang, thoughts and prayers
The general rule of thumb is once a stock hits 100$ it either crashes or goes to $120 within the week. Since we are squeezing the Chipotle shorters they’re going push us over the ATH and we will see 120$. See what happened with a meme movement like AMD in July? Roblox to 120
I’m wondering if sell at open or sit in my soiled pants rest of week and pray that I’ll be able to afford a new pair by Monday
Friendly Reminder: If you are making an account and have less than 25K, make it a cash account to avoid PDT rules. Once you are less poor, you can turn on margin and lose it all in a blaze of glory.

I said fuck GME because they bought my Nintendo64 collection for like 80 bucks when I was 12. wish I would've collected my calls back then, gme was at like 12$ lol

Since LMND IV was so high today I’m going to try to scalp calls in the AM. Their acquisition of MILE is a steal and if they give revised guidance because of the auto/bundle business 🚀
yes. you could even get it delivered instead of carryout dare i say
They could kick you out but as long as it’s covered and you’re not harassing anyone that’s the worst they can do.

No problem, always here to chat. My 2 mid-long term picks are QCOM and AMAT, both severely undervalued. I’d recommending looking into them and maybe grabbing jan-march calls if u like what u find
I think you’d be able to afford a lot more than that. Unless you only got 2 shares.

What’s your moves and we’ll do the opposite 🤝
The price reflects future earnings so guidance always matters.

8-10% otm weekly puts has a delta of 20 which is pretty fucking amazing given the premium for weeklies

The CIA would like to know how you know their location
If RKLB has a successful flight and solid earnings, the next two weeks will be immense. The worst part is that the market being close Thursday will delay any movements
Pltr
Sorry, i clarified in my other comment but i just meant to imply that his position size in tesla will actually grow before eoy, and he’ll likely do anything he can to push it higher after paying these taxes as a middle finger to the govt
It means my leaps are gonna feed me the $2 ramen cuz I’m fancy

Interactive Brokers vs Fidelity? Anyone use both before?
Tesla up 10% tomorrow to make up for the paper hands ?
There is no for sure plays to make you money doing options or else we would all be rich but spy calls longer than 2 weeks out are pretty damn safe bet every time lmao

Which stock for edible bugs?
Holy fuck. Did Elon specify which stock he was selling? I think he just dropped SDC
You &amp; me both champ 🤠 giddy up
Yep
Dip?
There’s hope that it COULD return to levels from last Friday. It’s tesla, it’s the one stock that could do it. But idk even I’m losing hope

Daylight savings maybe
Plot twist: He is single
Rallies? Down another 5% after hours

He's a Billie Eilish fan so yeah he does.
!banbet $COIN 400 4w
Breakevens should be the same distance from 470 since you include the price of the call + put on both sides, since you need that much movement in one direction to cover all your expenses before you profit. 

Regardless, best of luck. Hopefully the spyder moves a bit before friday, it’s been seeing some crazy action lately
Guess I'm lucky that my wifes boyfriend doesnt have a small dick🤷‍♂️
We already do but I'll call in a favor
Yes
Vagina just won't do I need the big money and I need it now.
BLNK going to infinity
Oh, no, on the contrary, I made a lot of money the past few weeks buying Ford calls, but I didn't get any this week because I'm becoming increasingly convinced the top is in
Ford just hit 52 week high AH. Just sayin. If that isn’t a sign for tomorrow idk what is
I was last week. Why talk about it now when it’s probably going to pull back to 19 again? When it’s $19 I’ll buy calls again.
This fucking guy right here 👈
Inflation is priced the fuck in. Look at the 1 year chart, shit wouldn’t look like SPY railed 20 key bumps. Bull run till end of January.
Eventually it'll breakdown and you'll put more money in than you got out of it. Typical Ford.

I'm not talking about the effect to TSLA, I'm talking about the larger market. Keep up.

Congratulations brotha. Just a FYI you can do the same thing with designer shoes at Nordstrom’s.💪🏽😉

Just ate 2 perfect maine lobster tails compliments of TLRY, likely to repeat tomorrow🚀
Tsla 1500 EOW
It’s the best , easiest , nicest platform for retards . It’s why Coinbase is so popular .

Over time Robinhood will be fine but they are over priced now
weekly, strike depends, generally i look for 8 -10% or whatever is close to like $300-$400 take away for the week. might not get one this week though because it pumped pretty good, but under $200 it's easy.
That will teach the world to screw the worlds richest nerd.
You would have been IV crushed anyway so don’t worry about it 🙂
My school called me asking for money a year after refusing to help me with a rough spot dealing with my student loans - I told them to suck my dick

So…. Is SPY gonna rip soon?
In 2000, Alan Greenspan, then Chair of the Federal Reserve, raised interest rates several times; these actions were believed by many to have caused the bursting of the dot-com bubble.

This seems way too similar
They would prefer a trip to space I’m sure!
Yep - I looked at the last several fintech ER’s and they all sold off. PYPL been beaten down and treading water. Figured this could be a nail in the coffin and was playing with profits from today so I liked it.
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Narradisall (1/2) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1300.0 when it was 1220.99 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Imo youre retrospectively picking a dip and hoping it replicates itself with not much reasoning besides elon selling his 10%, which is only like a day’s worth of volume. Best of luck if you short it and i hope to see your gain porn in here but i’ll never short tesla a day in my life
Have you ever used PayPal?
That’s how much BUYDEN wants to give separated families at borders. Imagine how it would change their life lol generational wealth for them

I wish I had a larger position in PLTR... oh well, me and my 100 shares patiently await earnings
By end of week it will recover, TSLA don’t fuck around too long, Elon planned this dip
Lisa Su is so fucking hot

Is tomorrow the day when SPCE will march to 15?  My covered calls would like to know.
So?
Yeah the merger is not a certainty so that's why it isn't trading at 1.7234x right now.

However, I have independently evaluated that there is about a 99.5% chance that the merger is approved and continues with no issues.

Hope y’all grabbed your NIO calls before close. It’s about to go on a mini Tesla run.
I like how you can sell like 35DTE AMC $145 calls and people will actually buy them for like $160?

BLNK has me fully torqued
investing.com comments are gold;  "Please tell me how to withdraw my stock and convert it into real money" lmao
Did you get puts too? I think that won’t make an impact for awhile they even guided down
&gt; Got it at $200 in March and have a lousy 5% gain ytd.

How in the fuck have you not been selling the peaks or covered calls?

Are you dumb, stupid, or dumb?

Long pltr

Yes but look at the candle for March 1st - March 8th 2021. We saw a tiny drop compared to that and if I recall there wasn’t as big of a reason for that drop as there is now. Huge profit taking plus the ceo is selling 2% of the company at some point. It’s time to take profits and buy the dip in a few months
UPST will probably be a multiple bagger for ER tomorrow

Only Q is which direction
I think I will repeat what I did for today, keep loading up SB and BABA. Not RIOT anymore, cuz I sold them today for about 15% profit, not much, but profit is profit.
Hopefully man drop a little more id be doing ok
471.28
take out more of my college fund money to buy options?
Feel bad for PayPal call holders… yikes
I only drink water or tea. 

I used to do protein shakes, but still no gains.

Rivian it's too ugly tbh
Maybe can give a SPCE ticket to immigrants instead!
Could be like me and burn $3500 on $250c that just expired. Only 98.87% loss
it's a great stock to sell CSPs on. I usually can pay my rent with it.
The volatility of the indices are scaring me. Im all in calls

Bought MARA puts at close 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
They lost all the revenue beats they made this year and then some.  And shit the bed on earnings to boot.  

Starting to wonder how much longer to hold this pig.  As a doc I'm certain the data they're accumulating is worth 100x the value the market's putting on the whole company, but it's no help being smart if the stock don't walk
Really hoping for a TDOC-style earnings fakeout

GME ytd performance is flatsville overall. Each time it blows past $200 going to $300, it gets knocked back to hell. Then when it goes below $200 it rises back from the Phoenix.

Well maybe not that, but still.
Hopefully losing less money than today. Aye aye aye…..
what ticker?

so i yolod my last $100 into a spy call am I fuk
You've got the best answers VisualMod. Maybe CHGG should use your answers for a finance class.
I think SPY should have just one red day. I wouldn't count on it, but this can't be healthy.

No. Rest In Peace….. but with a stutter. Rippppp. Ah, fuck my leaps.

Political prisoner of the Chinese Communist Party, hasn't been seen since January
Sorry for my wording, that’s not what I’m implying. Actually from my understanding, option exercise have nothing to do with stock price, rather it’s the delta/gamma that rises from options buying that can affect stock price through squeezes. Regardless, i was trying to say that elon’s position in tesla will drastically increase after exercise, which is bullish imo. The $450m buy order for jan $1000c last week was certainly interesting as well
Is not it happening with other stock as well?

What kinda spy action you guys thinking tomorrow before cpi report Wednesday morning? Looking for a dip to buy some calls. Took some profits this morning and now I feel naked without any positions.
Just remember: at the end of the day, it's just money. Use it as a learning experience, and determine how you can put the odds in your favor next time.
I’m about to check in one and see if they’re okay.

What are you the put police?
tell me my June leaps will be okay
Spy hurt me so bad today, why did I take such a huge position
Idk this Friday, but I would bet higher than today's close, only thing I can think of to cause anxiety that's planned is Dec 3 debt meeting. That's far enough out to not matter rn

I think it's going to do excellent this month. I spent some time yesterday looking up and adding together numbers [https://imgur.com/a/vAO5K9P](https://imgur.com/a/vAO5K9P)

Looks like November is usually a good month for SPY. Today I opened a bull debit spread that will hopefully double in value, just need spy to close this month up 1%

Also, look at last year's November, Spy hitting 500 isn't impossible if we get half that performance
Same dude who said -20% on roblox
Thanks man it’s way more fun burning money with friends

Maybe they’d come if you start showing old movies they can already watch on Disney+

I have never lost this much money before. Tmrw is going to hurt so bad . Not sure how to cope
Is that some sort of pocket pussy?
Congrats on the 100% gains u pleb
So just to confirm: your answer to my question "why wouldn't big dawgs/institutional players specifically heavily trade PM/AH to move spot prices in their favor" is "because the toothless SEC *might* fine them if they can prove it and also prove intent". Yeah, that's pretty much what I figured. Dumb it took you seven posts to understand what I was saying but all Gucci

I’m guessing AMC shit the bus
I bought a TSLA put today just to experiment and see what it was like. Feels like an axe commercial but with a bunch of dudes
we're reporting you because you are clearly a self promoting piece of shit.
It does.  I closed mine in January after the "squeeze".  I received a statement saying my account was closed a week or so afterwards.  I received the same email today, although in my spam folder, as everyone else.

Well that's not a fair comparison since pelosi has insider information
He has $90m worth, he could hold them bags to -90% and still be fine.
My puts would print
Oh so you got f***** too?
Yup, RBLX has always been an infinite money glitch for me. I bought in $70’s and was expecting for it to shoot up to $100. Hopefully tomorrow morning stays the course.
They grew sales far more than they were predicting, yet at the same time managed to lose far more than anyone ever thought they could.  And there's a big thing in the report about how they think they're eventually going to collect on a lot of insurance claims that were initially denied and which therefore didn't show in this quarter's earnings.  

If you're valuing this as a disruptive enterprise startup, then all good.  If you expected this dumpster to catch fire and start printing some money this year, this is not the report you were looking for.  As far as I can tell the market was kinda 'enh'
$400 post earnings.
Nah. I've got PYPL puts and I think we'll gap up and theta will eat us alive. I'll take my 15% and go home.
I fuckin knew RBLX would kill it but didn’t hold shares cause WSB retards convinced me it was a bad company.
I will 20 eow sound reasonable?

But pulling your dick out at the right time may lead to higher paying position.
My puts support this theory.
&gt; Yes.
Won’t print because it’s only 1. But it will make you a few hundred lol

Is Roblox the Metaverse we needed, instead of the one we deserved?
SQ and PYPL say make a ban bet.
What ticker hurt you
You made me audibly cackle bro. If these FB calls weren't boning me rn, I'd give you an award
Gonna save my account from my PYPL play

Teslas price action looks like how it did when it tanked from 900 into the 600s
You stay having one tho lol
Wtf happened? I look at the stock and it was 77 in afternoon and jumped to 90s when I looked a minute ago

I bought some NVDA leaps back in August expiring December and January, sold a week later bc I'm impatient and wanted quick gains. Cost was $600 and now worth around 12k and for sure gonna keep going up. FML
Even if they beat like last time, PLTR loves to give back it's gains.
I like LCID...a lot.
65 Record Closes this year I believe. 

Time for that giga dick hulk run
Ford 🚀🚀🚀
I THINK the best way to do this is by not cashing out everything. Cashout at money back +10% and let the rest ride

My shitty Jeep just GUH'd its last breath, and Ford is taking its precious time delivering my new car to the dealer. Guess I will just live at this Walgreens until then
Nice
wonder if this includes people who closed their accounts
I don’t even know why I’m watching SPY right now, I blew this portfolio the fuck up today haha
best way to murder someone without getting caught.  Bring them to a Travis Scott festival, walk them up to the front where it’s packed, and then push them to the ground when the show starts.  Thanks Travis for this protip
😭
No idea... I was playing the other side. It may bounce back or may not.

Clov gonna moon overnight you heard it here first
I’ve done puts multiple times before. Just thought I should inverse my gut feeling and go do a call on Tesla instead… I was wrong so far but we’ll see what this week brings
buy both next time 😂
why you use rat app anyway
Spy 475 or SPY 476

Keep holding like I have been for the past 11 months.
I know, and don’t get me wrong I’m not yoloin on the next WSB no dd ticker I see, but I had high conviction that Roblox was going to surprise us in earnings based on their trends and actions but I was too scared to even  buy a single call. 

That’s the big thing. I’ve been scared of taking risks all my life, it’s time I stand by my convictions
im not asking for much, just Coin to shoot about 15% ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)

It will dump tomorrow am for sure
I liked it when they put Uday's head back together badly for the presser
Your presence
Have you been hurt by pltr before?
What are the most likely earnings plays like fuck im trying to be like a roboy block
Exercising calls doesn’t pump a stock it does the opposite
Everyone tries a put once in college. You know you’re curious.
PYPL. Ripppppp.
They might finally be turning the corner yea.

I really hope that the next recession is started by Elon having to pay taxes.
A win is a win. Nice work!
Up. I’ve been saying 10 by December based on options chain.
Nah it was the kardashian mom trying to get rid of Travis .  Kanye  gone next is Travis
Well until the crash.
All I want is a 1000% gain. That's all I want.
but i heard it is gona squeeeeeeeze 🤡
Oh I must have imagined my 10k gain on TSLA puts today. Yes I got lucky and bought Friday but I don’t think it dropped as much as it’s going to
It’ll be at $300 EOY don’t worry lol people just love selling low
Idk how I’m gonna sleep tonight with pltr earnings tomorrow…
475, because why the fuck not and no other reason
Stop creating bills easy
Welcome to WSB

Now make a banbet pussy
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/manipulation.asp#what-is-manipulation
You are retarded , 100c is a 10x-15x bagger after IV crush if it opens at 100. It can go to 40x if it keeps going up after open.
I don’t see how they could make any money… yet
So the AMC CEO shows his hairy legs on stream and the stock fucking explodes. Elon tweets random shit and the stock fucking explodes. I'm starting to think the key to success is open whatever the fuck you want and start acting like a hooligan
I swear any day now we'll have a 1-3% pullback.  I'm in cash and it's killing me.
Few cents per share richer?  Stock's actually up since close
I think it goes to $120.
No lol but you saw today. Tsla led the charge and everything dropped
My Tesla calls are seriously gonna be fucked tomorrow ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Check out ZNGA. They beat expectations and things are looking up.
Buying some more GMG.V in the dips
&gt; 🚫🐀
I put the majority of my money in SPY closing this month up 1% from today's close. So just watching that and second guessing, really
Ford &amp; Lucid 👌
Thats why TSLA is still going down AH? Nice tech analysis.... LOL
Had TSLA January calls - Took 50% gains, sold before massive run-up.

Had AMD January calls - Took 200% gains, sold before massive run-up.

I've left 300K+ on the table on those trades alone, and made +35K. Even when you pick winners you gotta not be a pussy and hold.
I need more money for Dan Flashes shirts you fucking skunk
AFRM gonna do a roblox get in now

Your next play: -60%
Glad I didn't get those rblx puts
No, but close. He called all his customers nappy headed bitches.
I could lose 5lbs a week easy.  Then I bought an ice cream maker.  I kinda don't regret buying it.
Inverse your thinking
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Business model based entirely on not actually being a bank but needs to somehow pretend to be a bank in order to actually make money. Made sense when it was the only game in town.
I went all in
Was a genuine question to hear a bear case! Y’all roasting me cause I have a bikini or cause I didn’t post a meme stock ticker with rocket and ape emojis? Lmaooo my returns are valid 😏
Anyone playing some Sysco puts tomorrow before the bell?
Amazon puts at 3500+ Amazon calls at 3200+

been filling my account since March, can't get enough of it
Makes me feel slightly better holding a relatively small PYPL position. Was supposed to be a day trade looks like I'm an investor now
Those come from TSLA itself though, shares held in reserve, he's not buying them from anyone but the company - which he pays 150m or so I think.
How old are you?
Wait a week
474-475
11/10 $QQQ $400
So I stopped listening to the PYPL call, it’s just question time now.

My big hope is that by turning it off, I’m ensuring somebody will ask a question like “are you sure there’s nothing you’re forgetting” and PYPL will be all, “Oh damn you right we made 2 trillion selling hats”.
doesn’t seem that slow
Clov gang we squeezing to 10+ tomorrow 🍀❤️
**When Travis Scott Next concert ? I got somebody I wanna take**
How does PayPal relate to Meta?

Young bears probably not, but anyone who has been a Tesla bear for longer than 3 months should think what a complete idiot he is every time he looks at the chart.
It was 242$ one moment and then down the drain...216$ now

Not everything is a pump
Buying stock to push up the spot price of said security is not "artificial inflation", it's literally how price action works. Again, these are *very basic concepts*.
"The S&amp;P 500 index ended up less than 0.1% at 4,701, but enough for its eighth straight record close and the eight straight gain, marking the longest series of all-time highs since 1997."

Powell ain't messing around. Bullish.
so did every other fintech stock, record number of money in people savings accounts, this was expected
America’s feeling divided but if we can all high five over Osama bin Laden getting lit up, I don’t see how we’re that different at the end of the day 🤷‍♂️
RBLOX looks like it could run a fair bit given that earnings report and 1) all the Metaverse hype from FB/NVDA/AMD, and 2) the fact that they're the best looking gaming stock considering all the problems many of the others have (whether ATVI/EA or whoever).

Just looks like everything is set for them to roll.  Of course the stock is already high priced... but as we've seen that isn't stopping anybody from buying.
Reminder that apes genuinely believed that the 65 year old CEO of a multinational company intentionally showed his hairy naked legs during a live interview as some sort of code/dog whistle

Clov great growth and earnings i think its a good buy AH right now personally
Yes
You just made my night brother… I sold the NEGG calls for a 1200 loss and they are worth $17k. Welcome to Guhhh
Did the same thing 😂 out at $243 just got back in at $217 can’t make this shit up

wynn puts my brother
Well I have spy calls so if you can't beat them join em
Puts on Travis Scott
It's called Earnings.

And it was Spectacular.
When I buy calls:

“Huge earnings beat, outlook exceeds expectations”…..-6%

When I buy puts:

“Revenue and outlook below expectations, 100m share offering planned”….+35%

Congrats it looks like
eat my shorts
not imo. elon still has 28b worth of calls to exercise. im actually looking at grabbing some jan calls
Bruh that was me
PayPal has mostly become a redundant middle man this days anyway
Why is there a price floor on BAYC? Are people really buying these things for $150K… who decided this was the must have collectible? I just don’t understand
I was sitting on Roblox call fuds before market close debating on yoloijg it all because I believe in Roblox, but at the last minute I talked myself out of it because I just couldn’t live with myself seeing it all drop -20, -50% if it goes down.

But being a risk averse beta I cost me potentially hundreds of thousands. You know what? Fuck this. I’m tired of being a wimp. I vow to be a more confident person from here on out. I’m growing some balls today!
Roblox with the pump out of no where

Hope you weren’t grinding your teeth
oh you're a regard. gtfo , don't be salty we downvote your stupid bs

175,000 buy order

105,000 buy order

251,047 buy order

SPY 475+ tomorrow.
Hopefully monthlies cause theta is gonna win this week
Anyone listening on spce earnings call? I need it to DUMP
Intel. It’s been up every day since it bottomed. Options are cheaper because lower Vega. You could potentially get them ATM and roll into profits. It’s been spiking in the morning and then dipping mid day. Look for an entry maybe mid day when it sags and sell in the morning when it clips up. 

I don’t think there’s a lot of downside due to the industry and what they are doing with management and manufacturing capacity. It’s just flying under the AMD/NVDA radar. 

I’ve doubled my DEC call position since it bottomed and it’s only going up $.50 a day. 

Believe it will go to $55 by DEC or get close which is JUST a retrace to pre earnings levels. I have a ban bet on it.
I think PYPL
pls moon just a little bit more NVDA
Your email content says otherwise ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Can someone smarter then me explain CLOV q3 #s? I see yoy revenue up 157% . Up or down tomorrow? Lol
Thank you. Not trying dance in the comments. Just giving a perspective. This thing will probably gap up tomorrow and we'll all get fucked by theta gang.
$PYPL puts going to print hard tomorrow!!!
Tsla puts still the move?
FUBO will be my earnings play tomorrow.
sorry are tesla bears supposed to be feeling bad right now?
Bot
Holy fucky
SPY not my best friends
Just woke up from a 40 min nap at work. 

Dreamed that SDC went down 30% after earnings, glad I’m awake now!
I don’t think I’ve ever had an earnings position go right, PayPal gave me the hope and then took it away
I used old reddit , lmao . what are you 13 ?  edit: 18 lol.
Grab me a coffee
I sold $8k worth of January QCOM calls before earnings for $2k profit. Thought I was making a great move. Now worth $47k.

I held $8k of January PYPL calls through earnings and it'll probably be halfed in value tomorrow.

Holy fuck man I've been struggling and can't catch a break
Imagine AFRM doubles with AMZN deal and PYPL drops 5%. Record holiday season predicted xD?

Good earnings, bad forecast. Down she goes.

Pelosi will cash in on RBLX tomorrow then say we can have our shitty market back.
hoping WISH keeps running up tomorrow into earnings so these cheap puts print harder when they miss earnings 😊
Damn. Sorry it didn't work out but that's bullish AF
it’s the way I missed out on this whole easy mode “Just buy SPY calls” these past 3 weeks because I was in bullshit plays other than SPY
Steal from the rich, give out the poor personal info, rinse and repeat.
CLOV ftw
Not going to FOMO into the uranium stocks. But My wish is all the apes who are in them, that their accts continue to glow.

What’s MA?
i would agree that MSFT is the better buy, but I certainly wouldn’t discount Apple. Just new iPhones and Macs have been enough to keep them pumping out new highs. But yes, I think MSFT has a lot more to offer long term, new partnerships, Azure, there’s a ton going for them
TSLA puts. Oh wait that’s tomorrow.

Unexpectedly wholesome ending
F up another % AH. The Rivian IPO is going to be nuts.
PLTR will gap up between $42.0-$69
No one is IN the Mall, have you been lately? Yeah, me neither.
Why would anyone buy PYPL calls when it's trading below the 200MA and sitting with a death cross before earnings?

It literally spent the prior 3 trading days eroding it's 225 support and barely found weak support above the 400MA to close the week.

The truth of the matter is that PYPL is facing more competition than ever and they still haven't found an answer for their weakening margin in a sector where investors price in continuous growth. Compared to its competition, it's heavily overvalued. 

The move to the downside was expected.
He got shot in the meeting
Wait... are you talking to yourself? You just projected hard. 👏
Only needs another 100% to be worth a fuk
You’re right it’s not, but if a company is overvalued, typically that means people are expecting it to be growing, it is clear that PayPal is not growing as its revenue over the past 4ish quarters has been stagnant so it’s overvalued price is no longer attractive

Hope so man, u got in at good price if u went in at close
🤣🤣🤣
I own actual shares so at least my account not blowing up with calls I guess.  Was up 1000$ now I'm down 1200$ lol
There where so many multi baggers today. RBLX calls, SDC puts, AMD calls, to name a few. Of course I missed all of them. SMH.
I just texted my boss, congrats on his RBLX and he's like, when are you coming back to work?
Lol
It's not companies that miss, it's dumb analysts whose guesses are wrong.
Venmo
PYPL really just pulled the biggest uno reverse card lmao
AMD
Alright wait till Wednesday
PLTR -30k. Where is my participation trophy?
Clov mooning GME marinating
It’s just her trying to get OF subscribers. I respect the hustle I guess.
i think its because shes a fucking congressman right
Roblox 😮‍💨
God speed brotha
&gt;	if metaverse is true then don’t buy a metaverse company, take my unrelated bags instead
Zynga with a solid earnings and a 6% rise AH
As kid I slept with a printer moon on the ceiling. As adult I’m sleeping with the moon as my ceiling.
PayPal growth fallen off a cliff. 

What are people using instead? Cash app? Affirm?
No
I think it can 2-3X by 2030. There’s better long term buys but it’s solid
I see that now.. but 6.18 vs 6.23 expected, doesn't seem like much of a miss
All of my current plays have earnings in January
2k&gt;12k&gt;52.00 from Friday to Monday.
CLOV didn't fall enough to print this put I bought on it, so maybe leave the champers in the bottle, Robin Leach
What does that stand for
Wow did I get fucked with PYPL calls
PYPL must be murdering live babies on that conference call
Up 400% on my calls.
Call it weasel coin 😂
you cared enough to comment. quit being salty and accept defeat from the better person. 🤭
Tesla is getting gamma squeezes by the ridiculous amount of option activity, and is also a growing company so retards will buy. PayPal is not a growing company, is overvalued just like basically everything right now but the lack of growth means not even retards can justify it. The only way PayPal was/is going to increase is if enough morons bought calls that the market makers would get squeezed on there short delta positions, clearly that isn’t happening
When their servers were down the kids were unhinged not knowing g what to do. Parents realizing the value play of RBLX.
Robinhood was hacked.
Hopefully my personal identity information got stolen from Robinhood. Maybe one of them can finally make something out of me 😐
AMD is bear conversion therapy
how long are you talking? look at their history, if you’re talking like 10/20/30 year holds. if so, they’re a huge buy, alongside Microsoft
Yeah would have been good juju for the rest of us
Just use limit orders and just about any brokerage lets you trade AH.
They go home early and best their spouse
I stopped doing earnings because I know about that.
That’s actually a lot of change.
It’s apple
Except Mary, cuz he came in her
Me
F for Sophie…..RIP
If metaverse is true than put your hands in PYPL not rblx bs.
Change it to something you don't know, your performance will improve
What the crap is going on with PYPL?!
Don’t drop the soap
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|downvote)
It will do worse than Microsoft or Google
The market has so much bloat right now. Everyone is in everyting. Coins, nfts, weird deals, random shit! Every company is looking for an excuse to keep their momentum going
Tomorrow are we going to see on daily Favorites tickers: GME | AMC | CLOV | PLTR | PROG ?
We’ve had like 15/16 Green days rains got to come down at some point right?

HOOD sold our info to a Nigerian Prince. Color me Shocked!
paypal call was a homerun for me. wasn't in the stock, but will be now. partnering with walmart and amazon. then it sells off? time to load up my overpriced rivian truck with Paypal shares and opts (leaps).
I’m jacked to the tits.
I swear to god, every time I turn around Ford goes up another $0.02. You sneaky little bitch
It annoys me that amc isn’t at 0. Am I a hater?

Yes.
My mom bought AMD when it was 10 dollars and she won't shut up about it.
I’ve never been played In my life like pypl before
Yes
Paypal beats earnings and ends red hahaha
Algos manipulating the market smh
Lmao Regel has been selling packaged popcorn for years. No one buys shit from vending machines in a mall
Does this honestly surprise anyone…
Good to know

We should start an ETF that matches their portfolio moves.
✋
Narcissism and selfies
You are just talking out of your ass. No metric makes it valued correctly at 200$
You don't have to pay capital gains tax it you only lose money
You too can trade AH unless your only holding options. It's not a secret club
What are your predictions for apple long term?
When Lemonade gives you lemons..
That was like my first week trading lol I thought this shit was gonna be easy when I bought it at 20 and sold at 75

No, because you're the only one that actually cares. 🤭
Bro, what the fuck is AMC guy talking about? Mall popcorn, corn internet coin, its like we live in a South Park episode now lol.
Im assuming you meant to say Hydroponic lol
Somewhere Peter Lynch is laughing at you
Hope not. Someone called for fiddy eow there. I sure would like that.
Amen 🙏
Should have sold more $30c on PLTR before eod.
Fr my calls were looking good this morning then I was like what the fuck
Don't cry, at least you're not one the hacks at marketwatch or bloomberg having to constantly edit your earnings articles because you're just making shit up.
Numbers don’t mean shit in this market. We all know it. or how do you justify stuff like tesla? Do you expect them to make enough revenue to hit that market cap?

Anyone here talking about TLRY or nah

Indeed keep running!
Time well spent?
literally no one is selling!!!!1
yah I did that too. awesome value
RBLX: We signed a partnership with Hertz. Kids will be able to rent blocks instead of buying them.
They missed revenue

Is this the month of dumping? After Moderna and here we are Tesla , it’s like someone is dumping an ice cold water in my face , 21 billion of shares that Elon is going to sell, is gonna be tremendously amount of money, I don’t know about you guys but I already sold mine before my ass is burn 🔥.
They are very different companies IMO. But yeah hedging is a good idea if you are way up on SOFI going into ER.
You can do it too with pretty much any broker if you call and ask them to enable it.
AMC gonna make a popcorn coin 😂 to the mother fucking moon baby! 🚀🌕
PYPL firesale tomorrow
Short PayPal to 200 please!!! Go bears go!!! I luh you &lt;3
I shorted rblx at $96 gonna swing them overnight, how’s that looking

Went with an FD because why not. Not sweating it.
Stop giving me hope and let me be sad damnit
Just woke up, wonder how my SDC calls are looking!
Lmao PYPL, up 6% to down 5%, never change
You had two drink-all-you-can fountain drinks with that too if you wanted
Will my tesla 11/19 2000c make me any money I got it dirt cheap for hunnid bucks who knows what will ruckin happen
**LIVER KING!!!!!**
No but I should have. Any news, even if it's good news PLTR always finds a way to drop lol. Been bag holding for almost a year lol.
The last time I went to the mall was 3 years ago when I was home from college and my mom wanted to go because she is old school like that. My mom asked a worker if they had an item in stock and they told her to order it online. I don’t think she has been to the mall since and this is someone who refuses to use self checkouts even though its faster
I haven't even been watching it since the last spike
Fuck off Pypl with this bullshit reversal! I’m gonna start using Zelle now!
What’s going on with PayPal guys I’m scawwed
You seen your girlfriends teeth bro?
Riding a 250 delta
🤞
UPST calls

Fubo puts

Let’s hit it up now
PYPL what a wild ride. Glad I sat this one out.
So basically RBLX kidnaps kids and gets ransom money from parents.
Me
Sounds like a great post earnings play then I’m in
Cathie desperately buying the HOOD dips
TSLA ATH by Friday
anyone rethinking SOFI earnings after PYPL earnings?
Yussssssssss
Is it just me or is allowing certain people to trade immediately after earnings come out in AH kind of bullshit?
Yerrrr
Guidance
My decision to give up on PYPL after it jumped and dropped is looking better every minute.
Cathie needs to go back to doing more KO and buying more TSLA PLTR CRSP and TDOC
Vega is a real bitch
That dip on negg last week would’ve paid nicely today
true. sold AMD at like $92 or some shit. made money but ya know. real glad I bought BABA with it :(
How did PayPal flip? Wtf

Since you asked, no
Too bad Rittenhouse shot 3 fools.....
This Thanksgiving we ain't having no turkeys. Feasting on bears bro.
Seems like the green theme will be gone tomorrow.
they are drilling now for like 100day, they never drilled for that long.... I am buying more shit, cause when this shit is going down everything is
At 3:57 today.
oof that’s a little too short term imo
Reading the news on PYPL... beat expectations, Walmart accepting paypal as a payment option, some partnership with Amazon

How's it going down? Seems like they're just trying to screw call holders and this will bounce up after a few days.
&gt; I started buying puts in the morning.
wow... all those call holders celebrating... they're not even going to break even
Who gives a shit. Money's money.
😭
Highly volatile price action between $1184.20 and 1186.88 will cost you $4000 a contract to get in on
Well at least now we can shut those SDC bots up
Wait wait wait.

When did you start buying puts?
2 weeks ago I sold AMD puts for theta money, since then AMD is up 20% but the puts I sold barely lost any value.
Et tu, PYPL?

I thought we were here to lose money
In hindsight an all AMD and COST portfolio would have been nice to start last year
I’m numb. SKYY calls feels like a boomer investment
We’ll see about that wont we

What is your put strike/date
Don’t want to get my hopes up but let’s go puts

Hahaha Robinhood just had a security breach and social security numbers, bank accounts, and personal information was exposed.
*AMC EXPLORING MERGER WITH AMD TO CREATE AMC.5
Why? Did you buy puts?
So market manipulation. Very cool. Very ethical. Very legal. Also the price would correct at market open before options reprice. But, by all means give it a try you financial wizard! Show us all a thing or two! You’ve found a secret hack that is an infinite money glitch! You’re smarter than wallstreet! Friendly tip: when you think to yourself “this is so easy it seems like free money.” There is always a reason it doesn’t work.
in due time, no need to rush.
There's something poetic about AMC ceo not having sold a single share. "Gotts be cool like the kids, baghold forever!"
Averaging down my January PYPL Calls tomorrow I guess.
wynn puts will print after earnings
I have PayPal puts and roblox puts
Now you know what it's like to be poor!
Well fuck. My record with earnings is truly awful. I'm posting every time I make an earnings play so you can all inverse me
Are we still expecting boomer Ford to do anything this week?
Are you looking to 10x your account this week or cheaper option plays with higher probabilities?
Took $60 Profit on MAFT 315 calls the day of earnings. 🤡it happens. Find the next play.
Lol probably based on NFT.  Meme city.
You tell that motherfucker
Don’t forget PROG
Turns out that story is actually fake.
this is why I stopped playing earnings years ago. unless it's a run up.
Real girl or "disruptive" girl?
#OH SHIT MY PAYPAL PUTS PRINTING
I wonder how much money I'll lose on PLTR tomorrow after the earnings call
Well i bought rblx calls today so im going to the fucking moon
The $SDC pullback is nutz.  I'm loading up on 11/12 $4C tomorrow.  Buy the dip baby....
[deleted]
PYPL drilling.
This girl is hot
When did it dump?
I know one of you fuckers has PYPL calls and RBLX puts right now.
They knew about $PYPL
Probably going to fomo in if it drops to .91
Damn RBLX. Didn't see that coming. Well done!
All in TESLA Tuesday!
Stocks are missing earnings and going to 0 yet a stock like LCID is at $47? Makes no sense
I feel ya mate whales bringing it way down
yea thats what i am thinking too.
$75 a share is a bit too rich for my blood. A lot of potential to drop early
it'll recover nicely.
Remember the 🤡 that were CashGang back at $430 because everything was overpriced. They weren't wrong but they're not making $$$
SPCE CALLS ARE POOPED
Wow PYPL the worst stock of all time. Fuckkkkk
215 was my put lol

Wow PYPL…Have some respect for yourself. Whoever is speaking on the call should probably stop or they’ll have to announce buybacks to stop the bleeding.
Welp with that PYPL dump I'll be out of the market for awhile. Adios

This is bizzare. SDC is having more volume overtime ah, and they seem to be buying for some reason,  preventing SDC from going below $4.

But why? The company is a zombie.

Hey /u/renegade2592 

[What happened?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpb8yh/daily_discussion_thread_for_november_08_2021/hjune2b/)


AMD and GME both down or flat AH, I thought they were both ripping to 250 =(
You got what you asked for
Nah. Eventually it will get delisted.
These are all fundamentally flawed stocks.

CLOV is not a tech company. They are an insurance company. Nothing wrong with that, but the multiples are misaligned.

AMC needs more dilution. It can be saved but it is dying a slow death to debt.

SDC... why this was a thing never made sense to me. This was literally people picking stocks with high SI.
Fk pypl
[deleted]
Don't talk about my kids like that.
Stonk girl here- I think UPST is the best long term hold and company forming a competitive advantage/moat since they’re revolutionizing the way credit is handled and dipping into all types of online borrowing. Is anybody else bullish or have a bear case? Haven’t seen it mentioned in a while 🤓
Who isn’t holding GME at this point though really

Who isn't would be an easier question. The real question is who's ready to buy tomorrow?
pypl down 30% from ath, you'd think earnings would be priced in
They beat earnings and its down 4%, what is this bs
got 2 hotdogs and slice of pizza today at Costco = $5.32  I thought I messed my order up and left something out. fukin crazy.
SPY, QQQ, IWM calls will always be fine.
Sold my coin 350c for +25% today. Too scared to hold through earnings
Yes, you enormous fucking clown, please downvote me because you're financially illiterate and don't understand what I'm saying. Go back and read my post again. If your goal is to move the price action as much as possible with as little capital as possible then yes, low liquidity is your friend. Yes, you will probably pay slightly more crossing the bid-ask during after hours, but if you spend an extra $100k on a $5m order to push the spot price up $3 (which in turn makes your options open $200k up the next morning), then it's probably beneficial to do that, even if you spend a little more in the short term. Do you understand?

I gave up on them
Naked and afraid of puts
I have a Pay Pal call but I can’t help but uncontrollably laugh at peoples anger
Expecting a PYPL reversal in the morning/coming week. None of this makes sense
If any stock could drop further, it's SDC.
Easy now. 420.69
Remember that period of time where this board was absolutely spammed by all the people that automatically thought SI = Good

Also PayPal played it's dirty trick.
Let’s hope, looks promising after this ER
There's thousands of stocks you can buy, yet you focus on these two shitttttty companies. Boggles the Noggle.

This AMC dude talking in parables like Jesus
Because it's in a swap basket with gme
Give me PYPL confirmation bias pls?
ZNGA fueling up the rockets.... Can see it becoming top company in mobile apps besides big tech.
No. Are YOU under the impression you get a better deal when there is low liquidity? Liquidity is beneficial because it reduces the spread you pay and adverse price movement you experience.
keep dreaming . Pltr brings nothing but pain. I have bad held for 6 months
Sold my 83c RBLX last week for a 10 dollar gain 🤡
If you can't detect sarcasm no one can
I spent about the same and tripled as well - good shit

That's my favorite play. 

FOMOing into a stock and losing 20%, then selling for a loss and splitting it into two different trades, which both lose another 20%
Same I'm holding idgaf same for spy  load tf up every dip
I also lost my GME gains to a SPAC (See flair)
All my calls are fucked for tomorrow
Chill. Amd got no resistance at these levels
&gt; I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic but I'll answer this one just in case. The price of SDC is going to go up, so buy a call option and hold until it does.
Thank you too 🤗
SDC. Guh
Dump that 💩
Lol I bought 100 shares of SDC and sold a cc. Oh well. 50 bucks gone. Was honestly surprised it went down so much. Maybe I buy my call tomorrow and just hold? Seems super over sold dude. Idk.
Who's going to play MARA earnings?
Yo what happen to MGM?  Is it because they selling their Mirage operation? That shit drilled all day . Prolly  selling my calls at a ~25 % loss tomorrow
Any move to make us happy?
For those people that talked about Lyv did you manage to get your puts in time?
my uber driver had a bmw. wtf lol?
Eh, dude made a 3% profit. Not as much as if he'd just invested in TSLA when he started but I'm not going to hate a person for taking a small gain when it could end up being a big loss.
My account seems to go like this

You could put on a strangle and benefit from a big move in either direction. Ive got $20 puts and $25 calls for 11/12 exp.

No need for scientists. Just gotta drink her own milk
I am *never* in something that moves big.

Except GME. And I lost all those gains on the fuckin' LCID SPAC.
Wowwwieee that’s silly
Yo am I retarded for buying $38 RIOT calls for Friday?
got very Gamble-y today and I’m not happy about it. 

Sold 20 iron condors though on good ole PLTR so you know it’s either about to rocket or crash.
Take a look at the price to earnings, it’s half what NVDA is….
Me too, that's why I bought 320c FDs at EOD.
Clean it for him
Why do people buy shit like SDC.. much less YOLO all their shit on it.

Yeah, but I was checking how much they were 10 minutes before close and I was like damn those are cheap considering earnings after hours. But on the other hand it’s already trading low AF so if it only drops 10% looking at break even. Turns out it would have been well worth it as it dropped $1.20 (20%+) as of now and I’m guessing that will stick or get worse.
Some spy and some qqq R the ones I’m worried about
Nah
85% down on my TSLA calls, thanks Elon
I knew RBLX was gonna move like crazy AH, I just picked the wrong direction. GUH
You mean not making money while everything goes up?

COIN earnings are going to be insane. I know this because they gauge me on fees every time I wanna buy something. So fucking dumb

Why does anyone even trade during normal trading hours? Like obviously whichever way you're positioned on a stock--short or long--you want it to move in your direction. And given that premarket and after hours trading moves the price *much* more than regular hours trading, why would anyone ever trade during regular hours? Just trade when the liquidity is the lowest so you can really move that stock in the direction you want with the least amount of capital. What am I missing here?
Dont do it $pltr. Dont give me hope
You know what. I'll take flat for a few days after this constant drilling.

Did he just say that they are going to have equity purchases?
if you follow someones plays on here thats on you. I didn't ever convince you to do anything. I don't even know you .. I lost a ton of money on rblx Zynga and ttd
Spy being weird AH. It’s confused, you supposed to go up.
happened over an hour ago. Old news
pypl is the clearest form of market manipulation I've ever seen, too much big money hitting the sell button whenever it tries to get up


priced to perfection to prevent any call options from being cashed
Yea

i remember reading a dude on reddit saw his niece/cousin on OF, and he donated/sent cash over cause "i wanted to be supportive of her blah blah' and she found out it was him and he was trying to cover it up and explain its cause he just wanted her to feel good about making money, like LUUUL you wanted to jerk off to your family member

$PYPL CEO SAYS $WMT NOW ACCEPTS PAYPAL AS PAYMENT OPTION FOR GROCERY AND MARKETPLACE BUSINESS
AMD 🚀🚀🚀
whats the reasoning that options aren't available for a week after an IPO ?
What am I missing about xlnx? Shouldn’t it trade near the same to AMD if this is a slam dunk? Or Is the merger just not à certainty?
I still don’t understand why SDC Was pumped so much here
I can't wait to see what happens when middle aged couples start cheating on each other in the metaverse
Am I insane for wanting to get into $SDC at below $4
The move for tomorrow is watching everyone else have fun while I hold AAPL

Selling my PayPal calls today seems to have been a wise decision. Almost got made 5 minutes AH but now I’m happy.

Roblox already supports VR on oculus rift and htc vive
It’s like $400 when they go to 0
When is the NVDA keynote?
AMD calls at existing levels? Classic wsb.
If they can hold it at these levels they can keep selling overpriced options to rubes. Notice how it always spikes up and down every once in a while? Gotta keep those premiums high
same, I need a good play
So this Meta thing is really becoming the new normal?
On technicals it might.

Ask yourself this - 

If Cathie Wood had to choose one man, who would she choose?

Dan Shulman or Adam Aron
Moon to 500
They actually make money so the stock will be flat
why the sudden amd drop?
when the elevator was partially full, my co worker used to bring up a picture of a big black cock and go "hey look how cool this" is and put it in my face. that was pretty funny.
Tsla?
Was def mentioned in the earnings week ahead post. That and the daily discussion thread are all you need to follow on WSB
Clov you’re doing great sweetie 🤨

Hit 244 and now flat. Unreal
Baby back bitch. Holding thru that until it’s red is the way to go
100 x $30 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Up 2.4%. Mostly on CHPT and LICY share gains. 

Can’t complain.
I mean I tried 3 times and every time i got like a shitty 3% or whatever, timing these fucking cliff crashes is not that easy even tho overall it's quite obvious.
Y  tf is it dark outside. Fuck.
why is still a stock? same for nkla

I’d be good with like a quarter of that kinda crash
Hope you like giving your money to theta gang. 

SPY trading sideways man
Bought some SPY calls, felt like it was set up for a good week. Still holding on the Netflix calls, a little bit of a green reversal today, hopefully tomorrow will be better. Sold a ITM Tesla Call to get out from under it but still holding some leaps on it.
Yes. Institutions like companies with 20%+ profit margins.
[deleted]
A valuable lesson for us bro. Never ever trust some pumpers. Only invest in companies that you really believe in from now on
... 2400
Exactly what anyone with half a brain expected to happen to SDC
Supposed to be weds
PYPL flatter than a white girl's ass
I got some Stryve beef biltong. So a dried burger.
You forgot the please at the end
I’m pissed about spy today
The ones he sold naked
Sold at 60 as well but kept 100 free house shares love me some SPCE!
😂 pypl really just back to where it was
holding my SPY 12/6 467c and 12/9 475c
Better off finding a quarter on the sidewalk.
Payments are all digital PYPL is great story because they are trusted by big banks
Medicare for all! $CLOV
Quite possible if Europe or Asia give a shit
paypal at wallymart!
You're gonna motorfloat them shares.
$EZFL and $RIVN
Will SDC recover eventually,
Why is amc not dead yet
That’d be stupid. I just stole some guys account with hella RBLX 90C though
The daily struggle
Holy shit. I never would have even had them on my radar honestly....
You silly guy

Smash with ZNGA.

Last quarter, they missed their numbers and they fell after earnings. But in couple days after ER, pretty much all of the analysts covering the stock issued a PT upgrade and PYPL started its climb until PINS happened
That was me probably....if it doesn't your good in that case I've fucked myself, why the loss of faith ???
I guess there was a reason why SDC had so much short interest lmao. Also damn, PYPL with the fadeaway.
Fuck that's hot
lmao get the fuck out of here I didn't convince anyone.. I literally just bought them on Friday after some idiot on here convinced me. but, yeah don't trust my plays cuz they seem to always be wrong (besides my peloton puts)
Holy fuck congrats dude
Lol

Pecker checker
That's actually not the usual at all, hence why I straddled my way in there.
Why? They’re still bleeding money.
Stop, don’t fill me with such hopes
Lol if that helps you sleep at night. The money loss is the same and ain’t coming back when your FD’s expire
Fuck do I switch out my Ford leaps for some AMD calls 2-3 months out? Already deep in NDVA
COIN calls , that’s what I would do if only I could understand how to use IGs CFD platform
Fuck you SDC
Lol. What???
Not for long
Tilray , you can buy about 10-15 options near the money

I just took it from him today. I’ll be ok.
Imagine you stole someone's identity on Robinhood and then end up taking ownership of an account with a bunch of GME 800Cs.
Ain't a dead cat brother!
I have some shares in retirement accounts but it's just not the same ya know?

Wouldn't be surprised if this fades to 80 or under again as RBLX is very fickle and user engagement numbers can shift easily.
Anyone got the gmt for the pltr earnings?
pretty cool when you want to show someone something on your phone and an email notification comes up for flesh light

Lmao could be worse, I’m holding XENE 30puts that expire next Friday, 

bought em EOD after the stock ran up 100% a few weeks ago and is somehow still running cause that’s normal to have zero profit taking 🥴
Probably not. Read the news. Fundamental analysis matters.
🤣🤣
&gt;SoFi still chillen, looking so fine 🔥

It's going to drill lol
The market makers
This for me literally right now.
PYPL ?
ZNGA apparently smashed earnings despite mobile security obstacle. Still listening to the report. And Farmville 3 just released and Switch games in development. That's my dawg!
Because it has a high short interest and is trading at its lows.

While I’m all for fucking over hedge funds with short squeezes, people have yet to realize that shorting actual bad companies is a valid investing strategy.
Roblox. 

Oh. Too late bro.
Uranium. Buy Uranium.
Buy the house next door, and build a tunnel.
Where is St Peter Tuchman when you need him?
Thats $3000! Nice!
Yeah this is bull shit

[deleted]
Not the sell side bc the afterhours price would have dropped significantly in value
Link to his daughters pics?
Meme stock movements today sort of implied a red day tomorrow
It’s up after hours
Although losing money on PYPL is still a lot more honourable than losing money on SDC
sry time is out
Phuc
Okay, so peak mental retardation
I was about to sell it today too, I’m sooo pissed I really hope it doesn’t get lower
This is why I’ll never have a daughter
Awww sheet my bad. I thought you knew because of your bagholding comment.
I got 1500 to yolo? Where yolo?
Wasn't that one of your two fathers?
You get arrested for creating money out of nothing
I'm getting rich off my SDC calls!
I missed RBLX train sigh
I have 15p expiring Friday, really thought about selling at a smal profit today but we’ll see I guess
How many?
Holy shit. Somebody on here was talking RBLX an hour and a half ago. I said screw it and bought 100 shares at 70. Just sold for $100.25. I know it's small fish for most of you "ballers" but I wanted to shout out a sincere thank you to whoever that was.
ah, thanks
Can't be blamed though, the market was rational on that stock and absolutely irrational on everything else. Much better plays around back then. What you should have done, was come back in after it's usual cool off period. I literally bought back in at the exact price I sold, but in the meantime that money made more elsewhere. So don't beat yourself up about it.
😂
Don't worry FB/AMD metaverse ain't gonna have anything on MSFT/NVDAs Omniverse
No one thought that. We all hope for a GME like squeeeeze
My magic 8 ball told me to buy it
For the lulz
puts man, don’t talk to me
Loading up on CLOV AH. Rocket to $16 tomorrow
Don’t stop
Roblox up nearly 35%
The market's great. The bear problem is that bears who only play on their expectations of what they think the market SHOULD do are generally taking losing bets.
But how can u retire with one
I need world governments to keep sucking the planet dry of energy resources but in a fractionally less harmful way

Next is amc![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

hey bro

i'm the guy that you convinced to buy 80k worth of RBLX shorts. just wanna say i lost 10k on them so pls remind me not to trust you ever again
THATS RIGHT IM FRUGAL!!!!
Seeing amc bagholder unironically say just wait till 4th qtr is truly something else
My one line lucid call can help me retire early or at least for the next 5 years at the rate it’s going. Get to $100 now!
Why did anyone think sdc was good again?

ppID would be better. The apple product would be able to idenitfy its owner by his dick or her clit.
if this gets 20 upvotes iwill give u a secret stock tip the choice is urs
Just woke up from my nap how are my SDC calls and RBLX puts looking
I actually have buy order in @ 14. SPCE was my biggest gain this year after selling @ 60 and I want back in.
But u bought only 1
They will announce some new deal but everything else = flat
I would jizz
Speaking it into existence here huh?
Damn think I should cut losses?
[SDC holders received this as a thank you for holding through earnings](https://i.imgur.com/gdBzdEC.jpg)
So SPY lookin pretty weak recently. I’m thinking a lil itty bitty bit of red tomorrow. Not a 🌈🐻 tho 😤
3k of SDC calls at close. Big oof
Reddit has YouTube commercials now? And it looks professional, like it wasn't made by redditors. Definitely was made to attract people from more mainstream demographics. I'm not going to get into the implications of how insta and Twitter users switching to Reddit would affect us on the app, but all I'm saying is they're going public. They have financial advisors and lawyers hired recently in what looks like a push forward on rumored plans to go public with the SEC. 


Would you buy at ipo?
Every Chinese Company diverts it's R&amp;D budget to SDC puts.
What's going on with that swimwear company that people used to talk about many months ago..... its gotta big green candle going almost up 40%
It will be $3.75 tomorrow... :(
AH
Who had RBLX
went from 6k profit to 6k loss in 2 days i feel greedy
I recognize these companies all from their P&amp;D phases... That might be the issue
Even u/VisualMod is taking pity on you. Must have seen your portfolio
IM ABOUT TO RETIRE OFF OF SDC PUTS MUTHAFUCKAS
Idk what it is 🤣🤣
PYPL fucking both put and call holders
Go long on $ROPE the ultimate ban
&gt; You are in the timeline where you get rich and then start smoking weed.
Cmon pypl you can do it. Find a way back to 240!+
First GME, then Ford, then PTON, now SDC. You have the touch of death
Huge beat. Initial stock sell of. Then up %20 during lunch
What timeline did I slip into? I’m making money and my wife wants us to start smoking weed together. I could hang here for a while.
Bought a couple calls in VSAT they are down 83% but their chart looks good and healthy. Looking for a bounce back
/What The HELL NAKED!!MOONING DAMM
Too much text bro
My puts thank you. Next up WISH.
Which one is the top company?
I had 1k left to play with and tried to buy some Roblox weekly 85 calls but they never got picked up for my asking price. Fuck missed out on a ten bagger
Yall need to stop being greedy and secure profits on anything decent like 40 to 70%

Options move fast. Theta will cuck you when you least expect it and market corrections can happen all of a sudden. 

Keep churning out and pulling out your  gains without being too greedy
People be like : "CLOV had a great earnings!" EBITDA = -102.3 / EPS -.31 against -.23 est. BuT ThE yOy ReVeNuE!!!11
So I'm behind the dumpster as usual right?  There's a female poster from here also trying to raise funds.  She has a few mental problems and something wrong with her face but hey fuck it right?

We agreed to each give each other $20.  This means we both get $40 according to our math.  So  we're getting down to business and I asked if she wanted to buy TSLA puts at the bottom. 

So now I got her pregnant and we're short like 100 grand because we got margin what now?

Anyone why is CLF not trading in lockstep with other steel, ie x,stld,and nue? They will own one of the largest prime scrap Co. Ferrous Processing and Trading Co which the other steel Co's need to put in their EAF's, they also are the largest producers of iron pellets which the others will need. Their old school Blast furnaces will use less coke which cuts way down on emissions by using those 2 products which produces the high quality steel the auto makers need and also be able to buy their scrap back at higher prices than others will offer making a win win with their auto customers. This stonk should be double what its trading at. This Co no matter what your politics will provide higher paying jobs for middle Americans and that makes a better America. This Co is making the OLD New again and BETTER.

Cleveland-Cliffs started 2020 as an ore miner and ended that year as the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America by acquiring AK Steel in the Cincinnati area and ArcelorMittal USA, including its Cleveland Works, for a combined $2.5 billion.

Because Cleveland-Cliffs is vertically integrated, it can avoid most of the raw material shortages and supply chain disruption that are plaguing other manufacturers.

Thats why you shouldnt listen to WSB because most of them are bagholding 💩 (RKT, WISH, CLOV, SDC, ROOT, and SPACs).
why don’t you put every penny you have into it then?
oh yes, by a wide margin. stock goes down 10%
LCID
some underware company that merged with an ev company
I struggled mightily with AMD. It was flirting with $100 for a full year. I lost a shit-ton on short- and medium-term calls. But I knew Su Bae is a genius, and makes kick-ass products. Options are a real bitch in this case. Shares were the way.
Silly duck , rich people don’t go to jail.
ha yea but my call is in December
Phew, glad I dumped PYPL!
TSLA is going to melt down for a little bit and then the news that Elon is finished selling his shares is going to hit and it's going to rocket.  You heard it here first.

Stocks been obliterated last few months and beat earnings + deal with Amazon is huge.  Probably some whales waiting for the earnings call starting now to buy more.?
I am now a bah older of 10k shares at 4.25
Yo Wats been goin on mon. Good tings in the horizon
AMC beats earnings fairly nicely.... down AH. 
Yeah. Thats how it goes in this market. 😒 🤔
Hehe
SPCE is a buy @ $5
How did they know he was low IQ? Was he long AMC?
If Tim Apple said they were bringing back the thumbprint ID Apple stock would go through the roof
SDC holy shit
SDC under 1.5B cap, so now the bags and the bans are heavy
They also diluted the shit out of the stock, so market cap is way more than 3.5x, even if price is same.

https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/market_cap

Looks like it's 20x the market cap of 2019
That's a good job

Well appreciated
I know I just wanted to vent about the cults. Hope we get to see some loss porn before they disappear forever.

SPCE spiked up 5% after hours on earnings now it’s down 0.4% 

I’m annoyed and overall disgusted today lol
I bet most SDC pumpers and bagholders rarely brush their teeth twice a day
went down
miss on revenue :(
causation != correlation, people pay for terminal access. If it were this easy to trade on a NASDAQ news feed omg. Could it actually be the sell side of the buy order 🤔
Stocks been obliterated last few months and beat earnings + deal with Amazon is huge.

I am guessing some whales are waiting for the earnings call to buy more.
Ain't no pal of mine
T minus 1 minute for Clov. Get ready boys
It's gonna climb after earnings
Thanks for the immediate 20% loss PPSI

Maybe buying a stock at the bell that was up 200% wasn't the best idea
Ask her when she’s going to sell while you’re at it
Glad i already bought my moon boots. #TLRY
The self-off at 4:01 and initial bounce was from limit buys. Then everyone piles in. Then the real news breaks that earnings were soft, and people came back to reality. 

Paypal is a dying boomer stock.
Maybe he bought $3.5p and sold $4.5p.
Don't worry 

You'll catch one soon 😎
wtf happened to PYPL rofl I see it at 240+ and go take a shit and now it's ded
Solid deal with Amazon, it's going up eventually. Calls for early next year is free money
Thank you WSB for what looked like legitimate DD on $WISH to the moon. If it weren't for y'all I wouldn't be in between margin calls and account deficits on Robinhood, so thankfully the hackers have no good reason to come for me.

They’re garbage and they lost twice as much money as analysts expected with less revenue than this quarter last year.

I guess you have to hold to your tag
As a dentist I can tell you we all hate SDC and think it’s trash.
I hope some people listened when I said not to hold short term calls for TSLA. This is gonna be a rough 1-2 days and my short dated puts will love it. If I’m wrong I’ll happily take the green dildo in my ass
!remindme 3 hours
That's true 🤔
went down
Need to make back losses.  All in on NEGG shorts in trouble if this runs

maybe $30
you're silly, why would anybody do that
The fuck happened to PYPL?
cant get a read on PYPL??? looks like a mixed quarter but the stock has been beaten down for awhile now. YOLO and buy???
Gotta stop being greedy
What, I bought $95 and $90 FDs but it should only be 1200% right
their recent commercial for Uber Eats is hilarious
Who cares 

Their main business is sale of popcorn
it is. sellers decided to dump 170k shares, that is a fact

SoFi still chillen, looking so fine 🔥
Ask anyone on this sub. Called this shit out before and SPY took an Addy IR the next day.
So none of you idiots called RBLX? Ok
I don’t know what SDC caught my attention, but it did and now I feel like a retard
🥭 🍽
It's down 20% AH ouch
WOW PYPL bagholders unloaded after hours 🙄
lol, what happened? Was looking good there for a sec
Is the thing to just never look into what other people think then?

I had so much of AMD at like $54 and always told my pals it would go to $100 some day but at some point I sold, eugh
That's quality son
They have the best chips in the world rn, semi shortage, Christmas coming up, all the blockbuster video games dropping this quarter

METAVERSE DEAL

SUE BAE

Take your pick
Yea
😭😭
PYPL spots oil from the sky, decides to drill to investigate.
It was up almost 6% after hours
If it just stays at this price I can accept it but not if it goes  -50% before I can sell
They beat on earnings/revenue and offered poor guidance. That means everyone who played earnings lost.
I’m drooling at the thought of getting it at 200
Not how it works bud
Nvda please make a deal with Metaverse 🚀🚀🚀
You don’t have be a fake internet money enthusiast.  But don’t shoot yourself in the foot by betting against it
That BiGFcknValue play. Backing up my big5 calls with some stock.
Will be back at $80 by open - this is just noise
You better not be stealing  burgers either 

I don't want to hear no crying now
Who is proud to be in a small dick club? Say “I”….will go first…I
Well I had the chance to get SDC aligners last year but no way in hell I was going to. Lol paid $5k for braces instead now my teeth straighter than a 1950s American dad with a mustache

Where is the fabled AMD AH jump to $400

She did shares and long calls, she played it safer on this which was obviously the right thing to do
I’d love to own PYPL, but after watching it for the last week, buying in and selling. Im in no rush.
I bought my first house this year because of my GME gains.

Now I'm already in the position to buy a second house thanks to AMD/XLNX gains. 😂🤑

Life is crazy. Chase your dreams kids.

On the plus side, it looks like SDC might hold on to $4.

Draftkings said it’s path to profitably was through New York in their earnings call. Well, they’re in NY no more excuses. Q1 of 2022 is going to be huge for them.
$PTRA had a great day, hopefully more this week.
Oh gosh I hope not :/
Can anyone provide a realistic scenario that would cause Chinese stocks to rebound? It seems like Government policy over there has no interest in pretending to be 'market friendly'... Is this a temporary thing or is there an end in sight..
Dude I’m legit just gunna start shouting out her plays when she tells me. She usually doesn’t until after the fact tho. She usually hits it big on boomer shit like Costco or tj max calls and shit like that
Is it actually trash.  I sold off my bag today. Give me some confirmation bias
painful but it isn't worth half that....was smart to sell. just sucks it has run up so much since.
I know. I hate my self. 
For the first time I yoloed on something foolish. Was just going to daytrade it but it captured me and molested me
still positive ontop of the green close' even if my calls are being eaten by theta. selling in the AM for profits hopefully.
PYPL is just stressing me out man.
well tesla back to 1200 or under 1100 tomorrow.. let me hear it
I’m buying mrk calls at open because of pelosi fuck it lol
Ask around her salon, they know what’s up.
Leather jacket is in season
in the AM
tomorrow pre-market
glad I sold my SDC a month ago, my god what a garbage stock
Lol I knew my leaps wouldn't be saved that easily.

Having said that if tomorrow is okay broad market day some IV crushed calls might be a good play
Yeah, I jumped in briefly, small stake. Barely came out with $500 from it. Way too much watching when I actually had shit to do.
Grabbed puts at close. Hopefully corn takes a small shat and we gap down prior to open
Don’t be jealous of her PayPal since it’s flat.
IKR market already punished it enough $80 from ATH.

HOOD PUTS? Security Breach
Robinhood Markets Inc. said personal information of millions of customers was compromised in a data breach last week and that the culprit demanded a payment.
Sure. But it’s a stretch to say no one would do that without insider info. Rich people take stupid risks sometimes too.
Theta is the only play on it tbh
&gt; You're not.

She work at Capitol Hill? Let me get her 📞 number, pls. I need a big comeback
Are you familiar with exponents?
Roblox has 6 letters in it. RBLX has 4 letters. Six minus four is two. Two time 10 = 20. Makes sense it popped $20. Simple maths

Honestly, why do I follow anything except stock hitting the golden cross pattern?
There was a dude here a couple months ago talking about making a shitload of money as an independent roblox developer. I thought he was just being an asshole, but maybe there's something to it. I was watching a video on YouTube about game development and the guy listed roblox as a commonly used game engine, alongside Unity, so there's something to it.
Why would someone sell naked calls on earnings. Look at what happened to CAR. 

Cover your ass buying a further OTM strike as well just so you don’t lose your shirt
Well, it held its gains for almost 10 minutes. Congrats dude!
I would actually buy a Rivian truck. I can't remember saying that I would buy an actual product from an IPOing company right off the bat.
Whats hype with PLTR? Earnings not till tomorrow?
Dammit AMC, dump already.
:( both of the plays I wanted to enter today ripped huge. Very sad I didn’t enter on Friday. 

Was planning on throwing 5k each into CHPT and U.
Why? They lost 18% of their revenue in just one quarter. They are probably going out of business like WISH

Anybody jumped on TLRY? Smoking some potstonks?

It's right back down now.

What's the news at the quarterback consulted with Joe Rogan?
I might be good at options plays but holy shit I hate my mom sometimes when she calls me and brags about her wrinkle brained shit. This bich just hit a 4 bagger on NIO in the last week, profits then turned into a 3 bagger on TSM then today those profits immediately went into PayPal. Is my mom friends with pelosi? Is pelosi my mom? Wtf 🤬
AMC looks ready to pull back towards $42.05 support(VWAP from gap) then skyrocket. It’s also the breakout point from the triangle.
Why a the shittedt stonks always mooning ?
How in the world does she do it??
Been on this Samyang hot chicken flavour but looking for a meal that won't make me cry 😂
Either way I'm loading up on calls for March tomorrow

SPCE should have simply said "we'll sell rockets to Hertz" and the stock would moon hard.
lmao i love reading people's reddit history. there's this guy that posted this 2hrs ago

&gt; There are so many valuable DD's on SDC on Reddit. Please look them up. Its actually a really solid Company with a bright future.

and then 5mins ago he submitted a post on wanting to 'end it all'. whatever that means

Don’t buy straddles on earnings you are statistically going to lose overtime. 

IV&gt; real volatility on average
How’s the CLOV earnings going? I see revenue beat but what about EPS?
They vary state by state and go anywhere up to 24%
OK, OK, I'll make you feel better. Imagine being an SDC bagholder despite all the warnings we posted...
I bought AMD when it was 2.20. Sold it at 3.50. Looked back at it a year later and it was 90$, looked another year later and it’s 110$. I was so devastated from the lost potential and never cared to look back at AMD. I hate it because of my own stupidity.
Yes, you are
I got SHIN BLACK (ramen after dark! Lol) at Costco this weekend, pretty dece - spicy beef and it had a supplementary packet of what I believe was powdered gelatin for that silky bone broth mouth feel
Don't forget pelosi also bought disney stock. Go ahead and get in now
I need to stick with index funds and blue chip stocks.
Some kid was talking mad shit to me about how he was more confident than ever before and I was wrong when I criticized SDC. Gotta dig through my million comments to send him a moon emoji
no its going to be flat or down, my $250 calls are toast
Do you know which websites? Lol.

tbf there were no indications of a great earnings
Ro fucking blox. I thought for sure Roblox was going to ruin the good month long streak I've been on.
[deleted]
I was just joking because the AH movement is see saw when it should be a rocket right now. Especially after the Pintrest BS. They put out a solid quarter and that is a tech behemoth and a 350+ stock easily.  Hopefully it will be more clear after the conference call.
$14, so I’ve got a little bit of hope lol

Roblox moon
I bought in last week around 5 just for a quick flip. Everyone says sdc tanks after earnings, I knew I had to get out before that
If it drops a little more tomorrow morning I'll probably buy a lotto
no, they mean stocks, it says in the report
How low can SDC Actually go tomorrow? Not fun just watching this shit and not even being able to sell this trash
Can Pelosi just adopt me as her son? She nailed the TSLA NVDA MSFT and RBLX trades perfectly.   Seems AMZN the only one in her portfolio that is not moving yet？
There must have been a couple billion robux in that infrastructure bill or something.
Mods, add SDC to the WSB graveyard
No. You’re both wrong and retarded. Don’t say you’re short if you aren’t actually short
I hope it’s soon so we don’t have to listen to it more than once
Lol there are tons of sites on congress trades.

Fwiw she's been holding it since IPO during the ups and downs.

Ppl always just make a fuss about it during these pumps but certainly not when RBLX was at 52 weeks low
Airplane
I bought them today cause I saw Pelosi owed stock in a child's video game company, she had to know something. 2 81c
AMC and BB! Let’s go meme stocks
Puts on FUBO. Licensing deals and sport betting app is going to take a hit on their profits.
It's down 11% rn in AH

If you have to question if it's an innie, it's probably a lot worse than you realize.
Hardly been priced in when they've been shitting it since they mentioned Pinterest

I didn’t need to know shit to look at its chart and see that it was already way oversold after the Pinterest debacle headed into earnings.
Think the fed means house prices
People spam that retarded stuff all the time. And the 17 year olds are dead serious.

We need to have a Pelosi thread with daily updates on her investments
Horse shit. I sold a put on SDC

No if they do shares now or in premarket.

Playing SPY options will make you question whether all adults develop object permanence by adulthood

Playing spy in TF2 will confirm that they don't
After a little while of being in the market you learn not to touch trash like SDC with a 10 foot pole...but everyone gotta learn that lesson for themselves.

The product is shit.
Clov had a big jump for about 90 seconds ah. Now, not so much.
good thing i bought a bit more shares of Paypal today
I am in after it runs up to 72.59
They are literally garbage video game of all time

They 50B
🤔
Yeah, well when you see the last several fintech ER's sold off and that it has been sitting on a major support for weeks now, it doesn't seem like too bad of a play does it? My bad - you clearly knew the AMZN/Venmo partnership was going to be announced.
Lost 3k today trying to day trade spy and tsla and the n put 6k on amzn and fb calls... tomorrow is a new day. I would love a big tech rally
Lol lucid market cap is higher than ford's already
My general move if I feel like I need to ease off the gas and regain some sanity (aside from just cash or shares) 

I try to open up longer expiry plays and do debit spreads if I can’t afford naked long contracts. Nice and comfy. 

Personally, I can’t ever succeed with puts because frankly, it seems like hoping for bad news or divine intervention to counteract general upward bubbling. 

Alternatively, I’ll go long dated, slightly OTm calls on generally good companies that have suffered recent dips. Big tech always seems to dump regardless of ER because it’s news is being sold, but the escalator starts anew 

Also If I’m riding something hot and slightly memey I’ll sell into a spread near EOD because my gut usually says morning sell off, and if not…oh well, locked in profit. 

I’ve gone up and down bigly, felt all the wild swings of $ and emotion, just now really climbing my way up decently and I am confident that contact hitting is the way to survive and thrive
So your telling me roblox beats earnings by .01 and it goes up 20 bucks? This marker is wonderfully balanced as all things should be
Probably was, too bad she's like twice the age of his cutoff
and also go fuck yourself.
Let’s go CLOV want to see this at $10 tonight!!

PYPL took the Space Shuttle Challenger up

Nah better to do that then sell short
Where do I go to get them plays :/

And this is why I only have 200 shares of WISH and SDC. I knew they were garbage but hopped in hoping for a GME like squeeze. 200 shares at below 5.00 cost basis. Meh whatever
Thank you for your service. Most people just rope before screen shot.
You cunt
CLOV and SDC fucks got FUCKED. PLTR gonna moon tomorrow and it's too late for you fucks to get in before their earnings tomorrow.
Clov earnings disappoint.  Oh well.  I can wait a little longer
Yea I FOMO’d into $NEGG, so what
I will never recover from SDC 😭

SDC calls?
[http://opcalc.com/DuJ](http://opcalc.com/DuJ) (Calculated with a 50% reduction in IV)  


The problem is that IV was so fucking high today. The Volume today was 24.65M, which is insane because the average volume is 400k....  


If IV somehow holds or increases, you could see profit. but....

If you manually adjust the calculator to see what happens if IV goes down, you see that pickings are slim. I'd say you have about a 5-10% chance of making profit. That said, the stock is acting fucking crazy, so who knows. The last NEGG rally lasted a bit.
more like robin ur passwords hood lmao
If I sat out today I’d be up 5k
It's crazy to me how blatantly congress people get away with insider trading. Like it's all public information. And Nancy's plays have basically become a meme. Yet it goes on.

You’re gonna have a bad time
Revenue miss. Lately you need a solid EPS and rev beat. PayPal is a good company it’ll be fine. Does Venmo have BNPL stuff? I only use it for paying friends and haven’t looked at much else
Aw fuck
Going negative
Rip my account
PayPal isn’t garbage… it’s you
Are you really surprised??
We'll see what the guidance is...

I took big losses on my PYPL calls with the $PINS rumor, but rolled them out to February so we'll see.
Ladder attack after hours bro. Launch pad forming at 3.59 next stop moon 🌝 /s
Meme/trash bid dried up a bit today
 Just got an email from RH about email leak, reset your password and enable two-factor authentication if you haven’t yet.
RBLX moons and SDC craters, both not mene enough, they don't even have cults. Lame. I wanna see some meme drama damnit.
[deleted]
I’ll check tomorrow. 3% up still a lot better than HOOD currently
When SDC was first being shilled here, I thought, Smile Direct Club... what a stupid company to be pumping. Looked up reviews, lots of bad reviews. People here got played.
Guess I shoulda pulled the trigger on RBLX before close. 😂🔫
Split squats my guy
RBLX BLEEDING OUT GET OUT WHILE U CAN
Good time to buy paypal call is tomorrow
Oh, why not?
Big dick club?
Still a good buy in?
I know VCs that had to take their kids credit cards because they spent to damn much.
they jumped onto a god damn pebble. why isnt this mooning on AMZN news.

fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
He's such a small fraction of the market and the shares he's selling such a small fraction of TSLA that it's not gonna matter. You're betting that the market's going to crap itself on a 2% reduction of TSLA's market cap when today it went through a 7% reduction at one point and the market sighed. LOL

This is just another case of "number look big" without any understanding of what the number is relative to.

Also, his sale is literally priced into the stock now. LOL
It won’t run too much more if they’re paying 500m
Bought lucid fds EOD. I think I made a mistake
Space shuttle mission
Bit proud of me today. Sold my amc before earnings 😎
We read zero pussy ma’am
Is she not old enough to play Roblox?
Apparently AH thinks so
&gt; Leonardo DiCaprio is a famous actor who has been in several movies. He was born on November 11, 1974 and he currently resides in Los Angeles, California.
I bought 1 put right before close without knowing what was going on, I'm okay with it
Ya I saw the revenue and EPS numbers, which don’t tell the whole story. So ya you are right in that regard
Serves that commie right

Roblox is flying you retards because they are likely going to be profitable by next quarter.
Shorts slammed it back down though - uneducated guess that’s what caused the -7% randomly in the space of 10 seconds
 SmileDirect lost $89 million, or 23 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with $13 million, or 11 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue fell 18% to $138 million

Haha they blame macro-economic headwinds in their PR. Nah, your product really fucking sucks. Cheap as hell. Braces are expensive but orthodontists know what they're doing.

They said it twice while in blackface
Yup def a win.
If you can by 250,000 shares of SPay you don't need to make money.
Why? Awesome profit margin, and they are basically playing with Becky money in Venmo accounts.
Wtf kind of dumbass is against an actual fucking metaverse run by creators?

Roblox is the creator platform for all ages. As soon as. AAA game is released on console or PC you can probably find a creator made version of it on roblox.

Roblox does not need to be the cartoon blocky game, it's just that's the easiest way to get people into the game and building.

The creators of games make money when you buy on roblox. Roblox is the exchange between player and creator.

It is literally a money printing metaverse.
Go home, you're drunk lol
Fuck yes. No one without inside information would buy that many shares ahead of uncertainty
Well at this rate amc will fuck both bears and bulls. Who got them iron condors?!?
Uhhh PayPal wrong bud wrong way

i consider those wins imo ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)

I'm ignorant. What does Roblox has to do with squid games?

every index will even though they've been doing that for the past 2 weeks... nothing can stop this market
I don't buy roblox, that's retail jumping in. By morning institutions will pull on "mixed results" ,to $77-80.
Roblox is what Metaverse hopes to be. But I doubt metaverse will be as open platform and thus will fail hard.

Okay well apparently some big money disagrees with you. I don’t own any but… you might be missing something that someone else sees
Depends on the situation. You should lock in some profit before earnings, but it’s sometimes best to keep your positions open. Just high risk.

Yes
always was
Puts on TLT anyone?
SPY flat means green af tomorrow
Bruh, I’ve blown 4K in the past week (all gains at least) and I’m almost back to even for my account. I swear to god I can’t catch a break. Any logical move I make just falls flat. The only time I make money on options is when I get luck with a meme trade and I fucking hate those.
Pelosi made a fuck ton on Roblox. I knew I should have bought some options when that shit was released. Damn it.
What is the chance of RBLX weeklies 125 C ?
4) sell right before earning
Ford invested $500M for 12% in Rivian a few years ago. IPO tomorrow and Rivian is targeting a $60B valuation.
I swore I wouldn't play earnings again after all my misses last week (missed the PTON DD, didn't play Z when it was so easy). Made it one day to GUH again
$DM and $NNDM tomorrow 👀👀👁👁👁
Fcel Baby 🚀🚀
Pay Pal whisper me sweet nothings
Sold my Sklz got 16k to play with. LEAPS?
^(IONQ)  


The only problem is that it rallied hard today... Might have to wait for a better entry. But I'm impatient, so I probably wont![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
I wonder what my roblox nov 12 $80c will be worth tomorrow
[LOL](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/meme-stocks-like-gamestop-amc-pose-risks-to-financial-stability-fed-says-11636406879#:~:text=The%20Fed%20suggested%20that%20financial,the%20resilience%20of%20the%20system.%E2%80%9D)
PYPL going to IV cuck all you goofs tomorrow
I had a vasectomy a few years back so my balls are non-existent ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
AMD cpu + NVIDIA GPU, maybe you should look at INTC instead
Obviously not
🌈Pal not ready to give up fucking bulls in ass
[deleted]
Refresh your browser, retard
Tendies my friend.
Well if clov pops off like roblox I will be happy. Roblox just boosted the shit out of my portfolio
Anyone else buying this SDC dip tomorrow?
PYPL fade.  red by open
NIO UPST FUBO CALLS
Yes. Oculus also uses Samsung &amp; Qualcomm chips, in particular phone GPUs, and Samsung was working with AMD on a phone GPU.
Smile Bagholder Club
So my eod SDC puts were a good call
What the crap small dick club
didn't buy my biggest position today obviously
SPCE coming back!
# OK!
What the fuck is the point of pumping AMZN ZLIKE THAT JUST DRILL IT to earths core? Man fuck you
This and pepsi, we mooning this week!!
SDC on its way to getting delisted
Lemonade earnings ….when??? 🤔🤔🤔🤔👍

Soooo what's the chance SDC gets delisted? Asking for all bagholders everywhere
They weren’t that spectacular
My god. One fucking penny earnings beat. Fuck this market
RIP to RBLX puts. I almost bought some today but was like nah fuck that
I withdraw a portion of any gains out into my bank account, I’m trying to jog up the hill with a weight vest on
I guess that depends on the action tomorrow, I’ll probably look to sell so I can find a good reentry point.
coke or coke?
This market bussin


SHEEEEESH
And pypl with the slow bleed out
I hope that helps my AMZN calls 🥺
Woah
LOL @ people thinking Elon selling was going to crash the market today LOL.
AMZN + PYPL = 💰
Jerking off to lossporn
Maybe at 3$ that'll finally be true
Damn Roblox going off
AMZN + PYPL = 💰
RBLX is going to make bank this holiday season. I'm betting Robux cards are on 90% of kids santa list right now.
Amc
yes but now it's the #1 risk to financial stability
&amp;#x200B;

Already out. They beat eps and rev expectations.
Don’t worry bro. What happened to BBBY. Similar thing I anticipate for CLOV. Their business model is  rock solid.
Apparently RBLX cured cancer
JPow's poll: should I fuck bulls or bears?
2.40 🔮

But I have calls so I'm biased.
CLOV bulls got caught dancing early
rblx is down 1% today, and 5usd since friday.

What am I missing? (genuine question)
Watching my IWM profits grow, waiting for spy and QQQ pullback
Hmm, PayPal hit $10 and now is at $5 and dropping.

Curious.
Oof
TY
Little  bit of a fakie today 

I think tomorrow but most likely Wednesday we see some real fireworks
[deleted]
The bot aint wrong tho, I am an idiot
SDC won't exist by tomorrow at this pace
PayPal boys about to cry
Man I'm glad I sold sdc, Holy hell
Should have gone bigger balls with a more OTM option - I was hesitant because of how expensive they were.. IV was over 95%
Roblox holy shit
Insert sad face.

Grabbed 50 at close .20

Shake of the dice.
ZNGA in half an hour

https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/9f4igotc
Rblx, damn
Maybe my $DASH puts will print
RBLX currently destroying the all time high
Me: buys call 
Stonk: —~-
lol that might be a 15-20x
&gt; @GangreneMachine
Im going to start following her
as a former wish and sdc bagholder, i only say this when it's a legit company that is undervalued
Now that AMD has Meta, will NVDA dump?
Thanks, I appreciate that lol
ohh fuck you PYPL
PYPL is basically like the TWTR Q3 earnings. Red by morning.
Please whisper it to me
They said it last month when they release the CPI data
A stiffy
Nice - you going to hold until Friday or sell?
Is SDC gonna fall below $3 a share tonight?

What the actual fuck lol
PayPal will be red by noon
shhh, don't pump it yet
Oof. RIP.
Earnings
Pulled trig on some TSLA 11/12 $1225 calls at close
I sold 600 shares of GME for $40/share about a week before it hit 500/share.
If you’re ever feeling dumb, find solace in knowing that someone on here bought $85 🍿 calls 🤣
So are there any earnings tomorrow that are also on congressman's portfolios we should know about?
Anticipating Ford to start a bit of a pullback and collecting theta elsewhere
I thought that was an easy play too. Still bitter about Branson in July killing my calls with announcing stock dilution mid hype.
it’s red AH bro
Roblox jumped 30% in less than an hour. What's going on?
Got’em
PYPL

🚀🚀🚀🚀

Missed revenue but beat earnings. Also announced additional Amazon partnership
Wow RBLX!! Go girl!!
RBLX just made ATH its bitch
What's the floor for sdc.
whichever one's tallest near me
Roblox you son of a rocket
The thing I was planning on buying calls on is now 10% up... I didn't have the money settled today and now I'm torn about actually pulling the trigger tomorrow. I hate when this happens
LOL
Idk which memes your talking about cause the only one that matters, GME, is going to revolutionize the trading market
&gt; Yes.
Steps for free money: 

1.) have *some* money 

2.) buy calls on any tech that is experiencing a dip 1-2 months prior to earnings 

3.) you have now created free money
I bought the January 2022 call awhile ago just cuz it was undervalued. I bought the $77 call that expires Friday for earnings
Damn, nice.  I would have gotten puts if I had the money.  And I don’t have the money because I would have gotten puts.
To buy more CLF calls
it took a while, wasnt there 20 min ago
Mike Tyson vs. SDC... 🚫🦷🥊💥
I can't help but laugh at the fact AMC is still over $40.. This just shows you how much control algorithms have when it comes to maintaining prices.
What is going on with roblox i sold but should I have?
Imagine thinking $PINS was real when PYPL was just planning $AMZN deal.
$IONQ 30$ before end of this week.
[deleted]
🛍️🛍️🛍️👜👜👜👛👛🎒
SDC what a joke.
I bought PayPal at $226 last week 🥲
added to PYPL today, and BA. One of them is gonna fuk me :--)
They really need to stop letting you go to those little league games...
Whoever has RBLX calls is waking up to a 60,000% trade… holy fucking shit 😭
Xilinx

Once (if) the acquisition happens, I believe that AMD will have momentum to reach 300$ by this time next year.
Roblox owns your children. Just accept it, it's easier that way.
[deleted]
Puts on RBLX next earnings , their fking numbers got jacked the fk up this quarter because of Squid Games and they still miss the sales number.
😏💀
New family members hitting you up, hey cuz how ya been?
👀
$NNDM/$DM
Those hippos were hungry for something alright
me too, got them at 32$ 50 of them bitches.
Same, I'll see you guys next week after I get violated in the gay club, once again.
You’re a dumb motherfucker, aren’t you?
IKR. I knew they would miss with the outage, so expecting a big bounce seemed out. Oh well.
i just need rblx to drop to 72
A lot of fucking money.
Chamath companies getting fucked
u/ichantz did at 3:55
Thank god PYPL. Would have made some real stupid plays tomorrow if PYPL cucked me any more than it already has these past couple of weeks.
Hard to smile when you don't have any teeth left lol
I bought puts on RBLX, should have bought calls fml
Indeed. Long term hold.
Pelosi 🤑
Al in on CLOV get them shorties.  Record revenue!! Can
Lol RBLX still going.

$$$$
Maybe Smile Direct Club will be better next quarter since they have to turn all your retarded frowns upside down after this earnings report.
I didn't have conviction only had 25 shares and call debit spread 😞
Hood down bad. Yikes
yeah wtf, just a bunch of retards posting about CLOV and SDC.  Fucking morons
I just busted a nut to a kids game
If the market gaps up again in the morning im going short thru UVXY
Bonk go to horny jail
Nah, I haven't touched Clov since Spacmania lol
Why would you buy such far out expiries if you are doing an earnings play? They were expensive as fuck.
I read about that a bit ago and the red days kept coming last week and I was like, there's no way the queen would hold something performing this badly, and I had flashbacks to -20% drops from ERs on other companies and panic sold.

I got bogged.
PPPL 💪💪🦍🦍
Best thing you can do to help your P&amp;L is to remove CLOV from your watchlist
Holy shit who has Roblox calls
Awesome. I was wary and only got 1 78c but congrats!

Gonna be a 20 bagger+ if this holds!
A fed official said to expect continued inflation. I'm betting those numbers are high
Which bridge?
Holding my $32 shares of Chegg long
X gon' give it to ya
[deleted]
Bought 25 x $100 Nov 12 RBLX calls for .28 at close…what am I waking up to gents?
FOA and ZYNGA up 4% AH for ER!!!
I’m a dumbass for paper handing my LCID shares :/
Market please go up tomorrow!
IN WHAT ORDER?
TSM MU FB 

undervalued and set to rally
Already is. Somebody out there has DWAC at 175
sooo tesla news just breaks about quebec deal.... do we still think it goes down??
AMD just got a deal with FB. Let’s goooooo
What is AMC GAAP net income this quarter?  Are they releasing that too?
Too small of a cap to give the ticker. Search for LMND news you’ll see they’re buying a car insurance by mile co that Cuban backed for $500m
I always forget to make earnings plays but when I do they always go sideways…. What earnings gambles should I do this week for maximum volatility
Thoughts on PMI, priced in or gunna react?
One of Us, One of Us, One of Us!
I’ve got enough invested that I’m ready for it to spike back to 100. But for you, I’ll allow some flat trading for another 3 months.
Holy fuck Roblox…
I only bought a 90$ contract that expires this Friday, I didn’t think it would have this much action
Palantir up 7 human scalp on the Choctaw Tribe Exchange
AMZN PAYPAL PARTNERSHIP

BOOM
Imagine going broke on small dick club
Great bet. Congrats u/gabethebaeb
SQ Gona ride those PYPL coat tails 🤑
Jesus, can't wait for the loss porn. I need to grab a bottle of lotion for this.
Jinx, buy me a coke
3.95 RIP
Bought some PYPl in my boomer portfolio last week, not much of it but green is green.
Clov earnings at 5:00 pm est
The whole sub got duped into SDC… it can go lower all the way to 0
I just bought a  RBLX 11/12 $77c before close and I had a 1/21/22 $80c..... Wondering what's profit going to look like ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
SDC got bogged 3.95 lol
They meant SDC
Can someone text me when the sector rotation begins again pleas?
End of week FCEL puts. They are cheap &amp; daddy needs a new cheeseburger!
Clov got ya down?
my move tomorrow is to either celebrate when the NVDA CEO speaks and the stock rockets to 350 in a single amazing day, or jump off a bridge
They won't be
It’s only $120 so far. I’m poor
A T E R

Unbelievable earnings. I lost hope on this company.

Tomorrow we feast..
Roblox what in the world.
Small poor boy from Bulgaria, Vlad “The stock Impaler” Tenev
Gain is gain
Uh oh bulls
CLOV, AMC, SDC hope they all disappear.
Looks like we hit gold bitch. Tomorrow and within few days, we will be richest WSB shareholders.
I’ve decide that every time I want to put more money into my brokerage account for trading, I’m just going to put the money towards my student loans. Starting today. I swear the minute the cash hits my account I think it’s play money.
there’s already a twitter handle i forget what it is tho
I just saw 3.99
Me too. But hoping the stock goes flat because I want to keep accumulating. Nice to see it discussed here.
I was down only like 8% going into earnings. So I think I’m good.
PYPL going back to 260 this week
CLOV skipped the ER and went to under
Me too pal
"Our third quarter results show solid growth on top of a record year. The strength of PayPal’s two-sided platform and ubiquity in our core markets has set us up to grow at scale, expand our work with existing merchants and attract new partners. We’re thrilled that we are teaming up with Amazon to enable customers in the U.S. to pay with Venmo at checkout.”
My bad i have calls too
Lol at AMC price literally popcorning
I am going bear for UWMC earnings. Wish me luck.
when nanci said that she bought calls that was it
Lol no. It depends how you interpret it. Making a 5% gain trading stocks in a month on our trash accounts is a fucking joke. Making 5% a month on $100m is great. But, she buys call options. She ain't making 5% gains.
I know what my move is tomorrow but I don't want to say it because I swear this place jinxes everything
Maybe in a couple weeks
What's a shit company to you? 

I run off pure belief of the future alone so I'm really hoping the younger generations really change the market by only investing in GOOD companies. Ones that are not boomer shit holes.
I'll bring the molly and blow! LFG!!!!
Does LCID have more room to run?  I just can’t seem to get myself to place a sell order!
RBLX 100 I’M FUCKING MOIST
roblox is cumming itself
I assume you meant mania but meanie is pretty funny
I'm dumb and exited my position on open. Didn't even notice earnings were today. Whoops.
Dang PYPL deal with AMZN gon' be big
Earnings are at 5:00 pm est
Okay that after market dip was a little tactless.
What happened to CMPS today? Steady climbing every day for a month and then tanked
ER is at 5, copium is flying for no reason. i see red tomorrow
You’ll catch the fomo soon i promise
Yeah you’re good unless you bought them like a month ago lol
SDC about to hit the 3s LMFAO
[deleted]
Why can’t PYPL also do a RBLX and go up 30% 😭😭😭
[deleted]
You're going to learn a very important lesson about IV crush tomorrow.
$ZNGA and the move is now!🔥🚀🚀🚀🌛
Oops I bought PYPL puts hehe
I DEMAND you post your $SDC loss porn ITT right now!
It might as well hit all time lows since it's so close
Did AMC report yet?
[deleted]
sold 2 RBLX dec $95 calls for a loss

AMA
Excited for XPEL earnings tomorrow. I hope their recent acquisitions provide good guidance.
[deleted]
RBLX literally got carried by Squid Games aka Netflix , tons of people were playing it because of Squid Games map.
how? it was bad, amazon just saved us
Sike
I swear retards on here think earnings = automatic moon. 

“Earnings for XYZ tomorrow, cant wait 🚀 🚀 🚀 “


LMAO Small Dick Club learning the hard way today.
CLOV drilling for oil. You love to see it
holy shit VisualMod chose violence
3D printing was never IP'ed, so this company was doomed to fail
explain this logic please? not sarcastic
RBLX and PYPL holders meet me in vegas so we can party 😂
100% but after today's gains I'd say it's gonna level if not drop a bit
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
U asking me :/
I'm long on AMD and aim for 1000$ within 5 years before I choose to sell it.
Apparently.
I did..but I bought puts for both zynga and rblx
DRILL CLOV DRILLLL!
[deleted]
Pelosi really never misses lol look at rblx ah
11/26
Kids are obsessed with it.
BTW why the fuck would you tards think playing CLOV for earnings is a good idea - its a fucking healthcare company not a tech company... 
If you want crazy multiples and earnings growth then it has to be related to technology. Look at that little bitch NET - shes gone 45deg angle up for the past few months. Shit is on steroids
lmaooooo, just a little WSB trolling; they did well on ER. cheers, hope you made money dude.
-0.44
Zynga beat babyyyyy!
SQ share holders liked the PayPal news 👍🏽
nancy pelosi has a great rack
Jeff Bezos - Jeff Bezos - Jeff Bezos
That’s what every bag holder says
Pelosi enjoy your RBLX calls
Dont have any PYPL but I hope it holds on to its gains for y'all. Seems like there are a few people that really deserve it in here.
I forgot I bought 10 shares of this.
[deleted]
Nice to see Fords boring as fuck afternoon is leaking into AH
doesn't really matter, it's all overpriced
Roblox did well I take it?
Still waiting for my nio calls to print after earnings
All my PayPal money gamble going into spy
Expiration? Probably is no matter what
[deleted]
Fucking steel, it better gap up tonight
Clov you sexy bitch you got this
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Once meme stock mania ends and the shorts slowly exit out of all of their positions there’s just gonna be a bunch of people owning stock in shit companies at overvalued prices.
Clov to the moo…. Oh wait ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
AMC GME lfg
I can not imagine paying someone to handle my investments at any point prior to having literally like a quarter billion dollars.

That’s straight up retarded.
So the thing is, Roblox is already the metaverse everyone else is trying to be the first to build
#Ban Bet Won
---

/u/gabethebaeb (1/0) made a bet that RBLX would go to 90.0 when it was 80.04 and it did, congrats retard.
Roblox PUTS at open tomorrow
Why NEGG make that move?
OMG I HAVE 10X RBLX $100C 😲 😲 😲 😲
Why didn’t any of you retards mention RBLX today?
AMC tanking but I can't find any earnings report. Institutions pulling the rug early?
Yeah and it’s up 50% in the last month ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
HAHAHA guh SDC
I’ll take that ride
PYPL LETS GET GIRTHY   


PYPL took a gas station dick pill
SDC ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Bookings/DAU info is all that matters at this stage
Rip
yep IV is gonna fuck my $250s
RBLX holy shit.
Got me in the first half ngl
PYPL for the win!
"RBLX reports mixed earnings"

*Proceeds to drill up to ATH*
Clov wtf lol
OCGN still gonna come back ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Might turn gay bear for a play or 2. Promise just curious
Definitely have a gambling problem, would be better if I bet black or red at a casino then spy.
That guy was also saying DWAC was gonna hit 1000+ within the next couple weeks and he thinks GME is going to 100k or some dumb bullshit. He’s a moron
it's a little different when the fed puts it in writing
PYPL BABBBYYYYY
Gz. I sold mine today. Made a few bucks but my account was over leveraged.
Damn bought 2 rblx lotto based on the DD my friends son gave me saying it was sweet
Because you got played by Chamath
I’m fine holding long-term, honestly
Yes these are what I was looking for ty
every SDC hodler right now. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
wrong direction CLOV
In for some UVXY puts. Why not
I bought AMD 11/12 $149 puts. You’re not that dumb.
Hrm on one hand amc beat rev and eps, on the other ticket sales were below expectations. Gunna have to wait on that earnings call to see if makes a real move up.
Pelosi is right again 💪 rblx gonna hit ath tomorrow
What's considered a risky asset to the fed?
RBLX going to break $100 - just getting started by the look of it.. Kids don't fuck around on that computer shit - gimme yo credit card daddy
My moves tomorrow-Sell CLOV off
2 min later I’m ded
lol cnbc can’t even keep a straight face anymore

“maybe zynga will be a part of the metaverse”

🤣
Clov you got this buddy
[deleted]
My smile has been turned upside dwn
PayPal ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641) yes sir

Now HUT you are next
Sure retard
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
PYPL just reappeared on the photo like Marty McFly
lmao CLOV SDC
Like we didn't knew that already
NEGG GUHHHHH
To the right
&gt; You're a fucking idiot
Fuck. My one call in the green today
If by calls you mean puts, then yes
Rip CLOV holders. Had great earnings and still getting boned
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
I'm gonna need more than that PayPal
&gt; Yes.
Same....I didn't really want to expand my position in SDC...but looks like I'm going to be up to 1600 shares after Friday....at least my basis is down to $4.73.
Today the Fed's financial stability report said risky assets are overpriced and subject to substantial declines ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
[deleted]
Clov  bruh..
Why did i not listen to nancy pelosi’s portfolio and go in on roblox??
[deleted]
Thank fuck I doubled down on PYPL calls last week near the bottom like a boss.  Not being a pussy is going to pay off
If I can make even a dollar in profit off of my current position tomorrow, I will sell it all and buy FUBO calls for earnings.
If it does I'm buying a Tesla with my gains
Because CLOV earnings are still garbage? I just read them... no looking hot.
I hope they and SDC bag holders find a new sub.
optionsprofitcalculator
Unsure why RBLX is spiking hard, missed EPS and barely hit earnings
[deleted]
[deleted]
Amc are u gay or are u straight make up ur mind.

Negg puts?
Thank you WSBs. My life changed since I discovered this sub and started trading options. This week I bought a 83inch OLED TV, a new $3.5K MacBook, a $2K espresso machine, a $2K Kamado Joe grill and a PS5. I plan to take advantage of the extended holiday return policy and returning everything in January. Can’t afford any of that shit since I’ve lost all my money gambling on FDs. But that ain’t going to stop me from living like a king for the next 2 months.
That’s more what I expected from CLOV
wtf negg..  this is not the pattern you're suppose to pump to 100 before the dump
PYPL NVDA AMD
No
PYPL lifting off
Get REAL REAL rich
lol fuck u CLOV
What a gay day
Getting ready to cry my eyes out this week for another $1000 loss on $FB. 😭
Paypal!! Went in with 4.5K on 2weeklies and 6 weeklies 10-15% OTM lezzzz Gooo…….
Ok bye I‘m goona shoot myself
Sold my sq bag to buy pypl calls for earnings. So far so good.
why did paypal and clov just do a 180 in opposite directions
Could be rocking with those
$pypl making me blush over here
Hopefully very VERY
F gonna rip with RIVN ipo

JPOW and PPI numbers tomorrow at 8:30-9:00 EST. That’s why low volume today, and weird price action on SPY.

Also Core CPI on Wednesday. 

Better hope the numbers are good.
Did I get too greedy?
im not even close to cumming PYPL. keep going
AMC where is u goin bby
I need PYPL at 250, fuggggggg
you wouldn't be here with us if you weren't ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|hug)
Hey Doc, my dick hurts ($SDC)
AMC apes in shamble
Makes sense I purchase my stocks using robux anyway
CLOV - drilled in seconds.
[deleted]
Options are cheaper, why would I do that?
PayPal Q3 21 Earnings: 
- Total Payment Volume: $309.91B (exp $313.66B) 
- Sees FY Revenue $25.3B To $25.4B (prev $25.75B) 
- In Pact With Amazon To Enable US Customers Pay With Venmo
Lmaoooooooo AMC fake out. It’s gonna be real quiet here tomorrow
I bought clov calls, roblox puts, amc puts and paypal calls. I migth've missed all but amc LOL
🎶 CUZ THE SDC WONT LET ME BE 🎼 

🎶 LET ME BE ME SO LET ME SEE 🎶 

🎼 DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE SEC 🎶 

🎼 CUZ IT FEELS SO EMPTY WITHOUT ME 🎶
Paypal I love you long time
I got SQ calls for PYPL earnings hope that helps 🥺
RBLX feels like an overreaction.
It’s down AH. Probs won’t get to $10 even for a long time
Whatever happens, I'll have fun blowing something and my anxiety will be through the roof either way.
CAT and F. CAT gonna pump tomorrow F sideways
Holy fuck my PayPal calls are going crazy. I will buy a goat for one you fucks. LETS GOO
SNDL .69$ you know the drill
why's it tanking?
I cannot believe I sold Roblox calls for a loss today
I sold PYPL puts cuz I was too big of a bitch to buy calls
Holy smokes RBLX trying for 100 🤑
Paypal too, right? Can we start a trading sub that just follows her moves?
What's the harm in it going up more?
Lmao AMC doing a cha cha... real smooth
I have to say that I was wrong about Roblox. Very wrong.
AMC have no idea what to do.
[deleted]
SDC headed right where it belongs
🙋
i’m soooo fucking retarded
SDC calls tomorrow? I don't think it can get any worse, they'll figure it out
PYPL is going straight to $300.
Smoke em if ya got em
Dude if it goes up to 25 thatd be awesome
Put is for people that can comprehend two possible outcomes
Probably in a few years yeah
IV is going to eat yo ass
Andddddddddd its gone. Welcome to nightmareville bud
Based on historical evidence, highly likely it's green again.
Amc after hours lol
Nancy pelosi has tons of RBXL. Of course it was gonna fucking moon you 🌈🐻
CLOV down AH - the bagholders celebrated too early 😅
[deleted]
Not sure, it’s done the exact same thing before and always crashes down the next day. Looks like it has super high short interest, it’s probably shorts covering some positions while the stock was at an all time low which triggered a frenzy.
KING to H1 is my only move available.
Eradicate the world of diarrhea.
My gourds! SDC
ty
Whoever was the dumb mofo that told me to buy calls on SDC I will get you 😤
ty
What stroke/expiry?
GUH AFRM
How do you check AH option prices?
Seems like a crappy deal. I have some 5c 2024 leaps.
Unbelievable people actually still feel AMC is UNDER valued to buy it up after a small earnings beat
I don’t know what just happened to AFRM but I’m soo happy I bought puts this morning
Yea CLOV! Do that thing!
Bookings = money. They just can’t recognize revenue until the gift cards are spent. But they aren’t refundable.
SDC will rebound.
And that, kids, is why we average down on DDD puts.
FB is drilling my ass though. I need 350 so badly 🙄
Guess what are the analysts at Zacks saying about $RBLX? Sell, LMAO.
how many of you went all in SDC calls?
Itwont
Damn so far i got TTD, DDOG and pypl  right!

Got burnt on skilz
Fuck RBLX
Marry - Fuck - Kill

“For all the apes watching” who let this guy on bloomberg live
it wont. enjoy your bags
let's go CLOV!
No way really?
Lmao cinema stonk
its all good. this but a fraction of what i made on PTON puts last week
Nowhere near enough tbh
market reaction is something different...bunch of irrational degenerate fucks
yeah the wrong way
about the same here, I got $80 call 😭
SDC still following the trend of gapping down every earnings , penny stock status by Q3 2022 if it keeps doing it
Wrong way SDC. You're going. THE WRONG WAY! 😪
Idk, you on the earnings call?
CLOV is so ridiculously volatile
Clov with the cock tease giving hope to all bagholders only to end up giving them the middle finger in the end for a Friday $7.50 close end of day ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Please tel me SDC will rebound
Nice 

I saw 140 today and said “that’s probably it” 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
CLOV to $10 EoD tomorrow! Idk how ban bets work but sign me up
either i make money, or FML. 250C
Shoutout to u/Ichantz for the roblox tip.
Guys omg I’m so fucking hyped. I put 7k into PayPal 240 call and I think I just hit big
What up visualmod, how the family?
To the moon baby!! Can we get $8!!?
But but SDC is undervalued / It should be a$10 it does teeth and all , Fucking 🤡 lol..
I talked myself outta smile direct club puts. Feel the pain brother.
&gt; I got the email. I'm not sure what it says though
At least I converted all my calls to shares so I’m a bag holder instead of applying for jobs at Wendy’s

I’ll sleep happy tonight with my 15k in puts that expired worthless today meanwhile tomorrow they’ll be up 300%. I’m good at this!
yes. i will do that as well
Yea. Idk what to make of that
It wasnt the money but the friends we made along the way
CLOV up 1% and the bagholders who bought at $25 celebrating like crazy
Holy Roblox!!! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
PYPL calls after the recent sell off were as clear as daylight 😏😏😏
I'm just gonna wheel the shares anyway, not too worried.

Was selling weekly $4.50 strike.
🔥🔥 **4:19 PM** 🔥🔥
[deleted]
Congrats Pay Pal retards we did it
Still waiting on AMC to report and who'll be left with the bag.
So paypal puts werent the play huh?
200% up.
I'm not selling because they don't expire until March 2022. 

Bullish...😂😂

But seriously based on fundamentals, I expect AMD to hit 200 by early to mid December
PYPL is confused
So, like, a LOT of Americans 😆

Strippers
PYPL RIPPING
SDC MOON NOW
The limit buys just got triggered in PYPL. Standby for drill.
I would like to thank the two parents who mentioned how much their young kids use/play Roblox. I love you.

Bought a LEAP on RBLX at lunch 30 min before close.
Have CLOV and PYPL calls… please do what RBLX is doin
sold my RBLX calls for $600 profit this morning. now over 30k profit 😭😭😭

Yes! The climb back commences

HELLL YEAH
Congrats! (And fuck you)

$CLOV gang bites medal 🥉pops champagne 🍾
Not as many chargebacks to mom and dads card as thought
&gt; I have no idea what you are talking about.
The CLOV gang would buy shares prior to earnings drop AH to try to convince everyone it is going to the moon.
Put your pencils down retards
Earnings tomorrow, and people are gobbling all things EV. Just an educated YOLO I guess?
Seems Travis Scott is doing a show for $SDC investors

LETS GO PYPL
Being grateful I only bought one lotto ticket to the SDC shit show.
SDC bagholders bit off more than they could chew so technically they're in the right investment.
I think it’s reversing
What a fucking day man…I can’t even keep up with all the craziness. And so random all of a sudden too
If you didn’t fuk with RBLX you’re a little bitch
Who tf keeps trying to push CLOV down. Rise up mother fucker. Rise. Up.
PYPL lmao
RBLX on stage two boosters 🥺

HOLY SHIT PAYPAL
Hey what the fuck TRIP
Lobbyist

[deleted]
Maybe they should give back the kids that were sucked into their treadmills
GO PYPYL GO GO GO
As long as SDC holds $4 it won't be a penny stock and you can go back to losing money believing it'll take off taking these shills at face value.
Lemonade to aquire
Never thought I’d regret not going all in on my RBLX calls
[deleted]

lobbyists?
Any idea why it went up? Bought one FD put at close so we'll see

How SPCE climbs when it literally does nothing is another mystery in the universe.
Stfu you made me lose money . Fuck you
Oh fuck
ZYNGA!!!!!
Why does no one tell me this shit. I need a Nancy tracker, damnit.
Yup. I expect NVDIA to make big moves tomorrow and rally thru end of year.

Tesla is a good buy right now with Elon having dipped it a bit. But will recover nicely and ultimately lead to split

AMD will continue to grow and reach $200 by end of year
What’s this
This sounds like a fun game. I need one super power country to not nuke the ever loving shit out of their small island (numbah one) neighbor so they can put electricity through silicon to make money.
FUCK YOU PAYPAL YOu MPTHERFUcKER
RIP my pypl calls

edit: spoke too soon?  

edit2: yup, RIP.
Fuck you paypal
I wonder if anyone ever made money in the stock market.
Hobbyists
Anyone else get an email from Robinhood about a data breach on 11/3?
Yo Im going to go on vacation this winter lmao
I can't fucking believe I sold all of my RBLX shares today because everyone and their mother kept saying it was a bad pick, god damnit.

Atleast my banbet of them reaching $90 by Friday might be alright
ROBLOX BABY
Imagine not selling TQQQ calls last week and buying SDC instead
PayPal fuck...
Uh roblox is what dreamland looks like. I.v. so high on clov that this 3 percent jump wont mean dick when you find out what i.v. crush after earnings looks like, thats IF it holds here which its lookin shakey. If it doesnt then yall are big GUH'd. Thetagang finna eat on this one
Hit on CLOV, massive miss on Roblox
[deleted]
Lobbyists? Dunno if I got your question right.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Ready for take off 😤
This dump isn’t the result of Elon’s news, the real dump will be when Elon actually starts to off-load 26b worth of tsla and the algos will simultaneously dump the funds tsla shares with it. Please be carful
So uh.. I don't PYPL is gonna have a good earnings report..
Senators
SNDL Calls are gonna get me out of my Kia and into an RC Lambo!!
umm have you checked again?
Buying TSLA calls at the top works until it doesn’t
Remember guys, the floor for SDC is 0. It will be below $4 soon
Crooks

Edit: And escorts
I bought puts. Makes no fucking sense how good they did this quarter. Guess I just need to follow politician inside trading from now on.
My RBXL calls are going to fucking printtttttt

One of my friends has like 3 grand to his name and *talks to his broker* about every investment and it makes me disgusted
How your AMD calls doing? 🤑🤑
CLOV pump back to $20!! Great earnings

Am i wrong, or are the millions of market participants wrong?

Very. They are doing cross promotions with a lot of brands and have a shit ton of money saved up. They are also pretty much a money printing machine and most of the changes and trends in the game are driven by community content, which means the company spends nothing.
A T E R beat earnings.

Unbelievable. The shorts are going to get crushed.

He must hate you. Unless you were planning puts.
There's the answer to the too frequently asked question "should I average down on SDC? Is it done?" What a steaming pile of shit.

2. Holding my Ford calls, about 50% up
3. Rolling the AMD profits into NIU

LETS FUCKING GO
Not yet but I’m assuming it’s going up has some correlation with its ongoing earnings call
ikr? now i will follow blindly
PYPL please
Hahahahahahhahaha, sorry for your loss. I would shit my pants if I’m trying to short a stock and it goes up 20% on 3 minutes
Because Nancy has calls
Its amazing to think how much money people made this month from TSLA, NVDA and AMD. First its TSLA then it moves to NVDA and now AMD. Tomorrow its back to NVDA and next week TSLA while AMD keep go slowly up.

NVDA - Jensen Huang Unveil NVIDIA GTC Keynote on November 9 at 9:00 a.m. Central European Time and don't forget Earning on November 17th.

TSLA - Elon probably pump stock up again early next week.

AMD - Probably more good news about Server Market and Merger Rumors.
Lol as if almost 7% in a month wasn't enough.
no way. She holds that? lmao
These basic questions are in the faq your broker has, you shouldn't be this clueless over the basics

I guess the good news is my 78/79 RBLX spread is good to go for tomorrow. Wish I bought more.
$DDD up 8% and growing.

Next up $DM and $NNDM
The 5p look like they'll only be a 50% gain even with the stock dropping 20%.

If only GME would pull a roblox at earnings, that would be great
Why RBLX mooning so much?
Yeah u can sell tmrw morning pre market no day trade ding.
Fuck me for not grabbing those RBLX calls
RBLX
You're supposed to do the opposite of wsb
Imagine getting access to a time machine and your first thoughts are how am I gonna retire...smh
Eh, maybe whatever that deep sea mining company was could give them a run for their money.

Not recently when it comes to ER. But SDC gang is clearly fucked
RBLX found a cure to being a square
This market is all insider trading we just donate to it.
LMACA better pop before next year
Same market day
It only matters for earnings or when there is big news.
I hope me holding this PYPL call works in my favor
Itchin for the AMD merger to be announced
hmmm, maybe those negg calls werent such a good idea.  dropping AHs.. fuck
148.55
I'm past the point of no return on my PLTR calls now. How those turn out will determine UPST and COIN allocations.
lmao. lost 10k trying to short RBLX and my stop loss didnt hit
Apply for congress or a job at Citadel?
Which holding?
KRHOOD 😂
Well looks like I’m gonna be a newly minted SDC-tard but SPCE flying again at least.

Up 3% after hours is a rocket ship?
Tooth gang in shambles
SDC, sometimes there’s a good reason for high short interest
I purchased 310$ 11/12 NVDA today as the stock always spikes during their Keynote (tomorrow 12 EST.

I intend to close at the end of the Keynote. Can’t go tits up.
Someone out there bought HOOD for $85, maybe I'm not the biggest retard after all
Cmon msm, do the thing where you turn everyone against TSLA so we can buy cheap calls
Lol, bought a couple RBLX shares pre-close as a joke, sold for +20%. Been stockpiling NEGG at $13, sold at +50%.

Apparently memes are part of the infrastructure plan.
Good fuck I almost bought rblx calls. FUCK
RBLX!!
RBLX rocket ship - bet it gets dumped before open and ends up back below $80
Sold some weekly SPCE 20P for some juicy premium this morning, outlook is good so far.
Me too 😅
Those bag holders will be holding empty bags soon when delisted.
Told myself roblox was an obvious earnings ay but was too much of a pussy
I am jacked to the tits with calls. Take me to Valhalla

Lmao just got an email
Thank ypu
.47 cents bro calm down.
Novice question, if I bought something today before close, can I sell it tomorrow without getting a day trade ding?  What exactly counts for the round trip, just same normal market hours buy and sell?
Looks like SDC will win that one per ah
Pelosi wins again!
Anyone knows when PayPal report?
Where is the best place to find earnings reports. Always a huge delay with google.
RBLX was easy money. On to the next one 😎

Watching the ticker i could feel the guh's deep in my heart. Id pray for yall tonight if i believed in god. Instead ill pour a shot of johnnie walker in the sand for ya at the beach tonight. Its okay to be retarded we love you here❤ loss porn tonight and tomorrow will be exquisite

RBLX was a gift
If I ever start a successful game company and make it public, if it's still available I think I will choose the ticker NIPL. Until then, planning on ZNGA to supply me with 🍌s

Imagine thinking that giving your financial information to a company that has an infinite $$$ glitch is going to go well.
Sold my Nov 12 SDC calls just before market close, almost fomo held for good earnings.  Glad to see I beat the AH sell off

I mean it's got a ton of alternatives that are better. The thing is though, Roku is built into some of the cheapest/ best bang for your buck TVs. You can get a 55inch TCL for like 550, 4k, HDR.

Yesterday $50+

Today $100+

Next week $500+

Right?
Not a fan of the guy either but it‚Äôll go up again today‚Ä¶it‚Äôll drop hard sometime mid next week. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it taps $100-110
When are options available for the ü•≠?

Just speculation so don‚Äôt downvote me to oblivion

This is the biggliest stonk.  Believe me.  Those losers at Facebook and Twitter are down but I will make WSB great again.  My stonk will print so you can YOLO some real money into SPY 69420 January 2024 calls for my re-election.  Bigly.

That sounded about right for the Mango pitch.
Yolo

Sup retards, i just made some money and wanna pump it into some retarded stock going to the moon. Any options for today or next week?

Yup
remember when exxon got kicked out of the dow and just death spiraled for months and greta was talking on tv about shit? i bought the shit out of that dip while also buying tsla. keep your politics out of your trading
lol..  I've been swing trading it all pre-market
No news at all, but somethings changed since the last dip. The bullish spikes like yesterday are enough proof for me, that the next run to 200$ is imminent
I don't see anything out of the ordinary.
Just buy shares
Lol are meme stocks all down 4% because you morons are selling in order to be able to buy mangobook?
Options hasn't even opened yet. His rabid followers are still wait for their paycheck deposit to settle with Fidelity so they can buy. 

This will easily pump over the next couple of weeks. Never doubt the devotion of the MAGA crowd or their willingness to throw money at whatever he's selling.
[deleted]
Cathie buying?? Jkjk
Exactly. Fucking gme, amc, doggy coins, all can sustain ridiculous valuations, because a bunch of idiots believe in it. 

Well guess what. This has the biggest TAM of idiots.

My new ratio is: TAM of idiots/market cap and boy is DWAC undervalued
Uhhh this is a hold till gold
[deleted]
GME right now is in full launchpad mode. The runup from the dip, yesterdays spike to 190$, todays drop, all on no news...it looks mighty ready for the next liftoff
All bideniers gonna short the stock on day one and its gonna backfire so hard when it‚Äôs at 80%
Yes, it pumped back up end of month.

Jokes aside this is not GME.  This is cashing in on a MAGA pump and dump.  But dont underestimate how hard the fox crowd can pump.  I think this thing hits 100 before it dumps back to 10
Other SPACs are discussed here - like CLOV
Ape love mango
What the hell happened to BB?
Mango needs a stock split
I bet Donny is scanning this sub tits jacked pussy grabed
They bought collectors coins for trumps failed meeting with Kim jong un‚Ä¶they will buy literally anything. They are the easiest marks on the planet
This one hurts the sold.  Ditched it a few weeks ago
It's yuge. It will generate billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars for everyone at WSB. That's a lot of money. Greatest ever stock.
500b in a week
Think i'm gonna sell half of my shares on a loss, it's normally after that prices go up, then i'll sell the other half and profit? this seems like a good plan.?
or my bunions and Type II diabetes?
Lol on what timeframe?
or "DamagedMitts" fingerless hands?
Orange man options? When commoth tendie man?
The political fighting alone brings so much attention to it. In reality it does have real potential, all emotions aside I‚Äôm glad I went in retarded yesterday and made some üí∞
Someone posted after hours here.  Thats how I got in at 21.

But yes its a spac and technically against the rules.  Not sure why the mods didnt nuke it to oblivion tbh.
More like 500x tbh
You know ‚ÄúTruth‚Äù will get pumped on SNL - to the moon!

The real fomo starts today. It's not too late. It's going to $100+
Someone convince me mango has more in it I'm scared at this point
like your appendix, horns, and forked tail?
Paper handed my mango shares at $46. Shame on me!
#its a rotation out of the memes and into THE ONE TRUE MEME ü•≠
Why?
I just remembered how obsessed they are and have put in couple hundred
1 hour and 9 minutes before I can premarket buy some more mango.
Fidelity is 7.  Mango had plenty of pump in it.
[deleted]
Why do people handicap themselves with those shitty brokers‚Ä¶lol.
for today...  Then it will be back to the good old standards.  :)
Found the üåà who is letting his emotions get in the way of making money ü§°ü§°ü§°
I found once you stop caring about losing money things become much smoother.
Im holding mango right now.  If Obama started a ticker for the Obama News Network you are god damn right I'd go balls deep in it.
Saw it 30% up thought what a joke, saw it 78% said gonna crash anytime now, saw it 150% closed my phone, checked before sleep said what a ü§°  are you no wonder you don't make any money
Ey mang to be our new salutation
Ah ok thanks. Yeah I‚Äôm not buying shares on any fuckin spac. No matter how ridiculously talked about it will be
virgin galactic penis
Come monday morning mgc pharmaceuticals will 20 x or more
GME should be a $8 stock, today riding around $183 and people are doubting the Mango stock. Wake up, this MF‚Äôr is fueling to launch üöÄ.
waiting on the Schwab and RH maniacs that can buy in premarket until 7am EST
yesterday in a discord someone berated me for helping fund a racist narcissist and i smh this guy doesn‚Äôt wanna make $
Sheeeeeeeeeeeit
My PINS bags want it
DWAC. This thing is going to 500. Think digital money. Think doggy coin. Everyone looking at MARKET CAP.

If the market is going full retarded you have to go full retarded too. If you only go half retarded you're done for.
Bruh... less than a 2b market cap. Shit is gonna rip bigly.
MANGO is the new FAANG.
Bro trumps cult will buy anything lol they will drive this thing to whatever he tells them to. These people are obsessed with the guy. They‚Äôll give their life savings to him if he asked them
To
Ah right. Yes they have had a wait list for most the year. They do tend to have a decent selection
MAGA üá∫üá∏ MAKE ACCOUNTS GREEN AGAIN !
Everyone already bought.
I‚Äôm about it

Making Media Great Again! And Free speech.
Might as well call this sub mangostreetbets at this point.
Totes. The money has to get parked somewhere. Looks like it‚Äôs getting parked in TSLA AAPL and MSFT
I'll send you 1K if this happens and I'm not even joking
fuck off pinterest, paypal doesnt need you
Trump's SPAC.. DWAC..  Careful though..........
Sub rules specifically state no talking about certain things or you get the banhammer.
you make a good point, and have convinced me to put couple hundred in it
never let politics or morality get in the way of making money

personally, i hate weed, i don't like how it makes me feel, i hate that certain friends of mine get stoned out of their minds and annoy me by starting conversations and not finishing them, but fuck it, I'll make money on weed stocks. 

If I was doing my "playing earnings" phase, I'd make money on Haliburton, Starbucks, Twitter, Alex' Jones website, mango bux and/or the failing new york times

i'm only here to get rich. i'll take any motherfucker's money if he's giving it away
That does sound good
Donald somehow making me money again
GME moving more in premarket than it has in months
This guy hates money, am I right guys ü§ì
IBM looks really good same with snap. Already way under the MACD
I‚Äôm not selling until China invades Taiwan. üòé
For real this is GME January energy
You thought apes were bad here comes the mang gang.
Market cap is still very low. You haven't missed out
People ran out of money or they‚Äôre waiting for market open because they can‚Äôt buy.
Amen.

Lmfao!! This guy is going to be banned

Everyone bought at premarket open
Yesterday was easy mode.  Today might be different
Euphoria? Check.
What‚Äôs wrong with you, you are being rational, üòâ
Never let your human emotions/feelings get in way of trading. Those are human errors we have built in .
They're already on NBC lmao
More importantly, on a pro-Trump message board, everyone is buying it

These people will NOT sell
Edit: the greatest former US President
FOMO is backing it up. 


Seriously, I don't doubt for a second that this new social media platform will poop out same as GAB and all the others. But after the last five years, I've learned to NEVER bet against the stubborn passion of his congregation. They're all trying to sign up at fidelity and throwing their whole paycheck into this. 

These are the people that bought gold coins commemorating some imagined North Korea peace treaty. Look at how well those shitty MyPillows sell. This is a demo that's just begging for something Trump-related to throw their money at. That alone will keep this pumping for the next few weeks.
It doesn't matter if you're black, white, red, or blue.  The only color that matters is green.
It's not even in its final form!
At this pace ü•≠ will have to announce a split soon. 8 month tsla lifecycle in 5 days.
TDS is real.  Triggered shorts adding fuel to the üî•
No, but I'm going far out puts, not weekly. I'm not a degenerate like most here with weeklies.

Edit - also depends on the Greeks.
I wouldn't worry about it. In 45 minutes pm will be open to more retail traders. 6:30 am ET is the earliest my platform allows
[deleted]
Yeah, that‚Äôs what people felt about the 2016 election, and the MF‚Äôr is still shaking the system up in 2021.  Haters just can‚Äôt shake the man, and that fuels him and the stonk!!!!
Wendy's Penis
Market. Cap.
Too many SJW losers in here right now. We are here to either make money or lose money, nothing in between
Reeeeeeeeee
!banbet DWAC hits 100 today
I mean.. it's not a profitable company already and they expect revenue to slow in the next quarter. I dunno..
That is the hilarious part

People are letting politics prevent them from making money

For example, I'm not super fond of Obama. But if that dude created a media empire today, you bet your ass I'm buying because he has over 50 million people who love him
I‚Äôve just checked and they do. But they also now have WAITLIST for an account, as they are the only ones. Damn.
It's gone up 60% AH.

Today will be another wild day
it was INSANE at the start of PM and then just kind of died
Any of the social media stocks hurt by SNAP shitting the bed.

$FB, $TWTR, $PINS
I‚Äôm not really an own the libs type of guy, but it is insane seeing how many comments there are here disparaging ü•≠ stock based on ü•≠ himself. This thing was obviously getting launched into the stratosphere, and I think it‚Äôs hilarious that people let their own feelings about the guy prevent them from making this incredibly easy money. He legit broke people‚Äôs brains and it‚Äôs incredible to see
LMFAO. this will be irrelevant in less than a month, those bags are gonna be so heavy godspeed retard
f those are good
Nope
Donny if  u r reading this say " clov"
Or below, yeah
Virgin Galactic Penis
I guess I don't really mind that Mango is trying his tiny hands at securities fraud now.  I hope he keeps it up for a while so the pump can continue
Sounds good, lmk
Over 9000
It's a SPAC.
I think it will surprise everyone. Fomo from non-active traders starts today. Lots of people will invest in him as an fu to the other platforms. $100 is not a stretch
Fidelity says I can buy 4am pst
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Youre not to late bro. That was just day 1.
How the hell do you buy before market? I can't buy till 9am
anyone getting calls on losers like SNAP, IBM, PAYPAPL
I found out about it from the news and made some very nice gains. Was just surprised people weren't talking about it here
I‚Äôm not ever going to be bitter that I wasn‚Äôt allowed to buy ü•≠
I think this has topped a really crappy year. We need Robin Hood, for all its faults, to enter the U.K. market.
Our stock brokers all take so long to add stock, I‚Äôve missed a few good boats.
But this one was a joke. I called 6 new companies at pre market. None of my apps. Pathetic.
I'd use ü•≠ and would probably be willing to pay $50/mo or so for a bundle.  Tens of millions like me.
Ask before you pay next time you cheap bastard.
250 bagger!!
yh ik but I still don't understand the thought process of buying an already 300%+ stock with nothing to back it up?
How do you not see that an echo chamber is great for ad income
I feel like fb‚Äôs pain is aapl‚Äôs gain
and twtr
Of course it will. There is no chance any True American Patriots will be left holding the bag. No way ü•≠ would ever scam the people who love him so much.

This is the way to own the libs and the Deep State. 

We like the stock.
People buying into Trump's Spac are out about to learn what it means to be apart of WSB's ... üìâ

Where did all the volume on mango+ go?
what does "planned" even mean lmao just go on Twitter dude
Assuming the future swaps theory is right, SHF are preparing for the rocket ride on 11/23ish.

Im an ape so I'm hodling, but for those who are not of our Way, buy december calls.

More.  Can‚Äôt hold back 80+ million people who actually like him and his Media Entertainment along with his Great Leadership.

Everyone here is buying the ü•≠ today. I'm dumping all my stinker stocks and buying like a mofo. Buy buy buy!!!!
so whats the play on spy? will it break all time high to rally the friday close?
Very few posts about DWAC yesterday. Seems planned. Maybe it was discussed more on Discord?
!banbet DWAC 30 11h
It will crash with fire once it‚Äôs clear the product is a joke. Fascist echo chamber and Trump himself has already been hacked and faceraped
Lmao, good luck on this
No
It's a modern family
That'd be like a 250x from here.

Is the Mango company hiring?  I‚Äôm ready to start.  I have a Journalism degree.
I don't think you have missed out yet. That was just day 1.
MANGO INSTANTLY TAKES ALL OF FACEBOOK MARKET SHARE .

Hey CNBC, if you don't wanna cover ü•≠, then bye bye üëã
I hope this mango stock gonna shake up the market and everything is gonna moon
With Fox News dads everywhere behind us we can‚Äôt be stopped.  Mango to the moon
I am pretty mad that I had to find out about it from Twitter. Fortunately the correlation between being a bear and being a Trump supporter is stronger than ever thanks to üí§üë¥  being at the wheel, so the permabears/zerohedge-style guys were the source.

But back to the point, I missed out on fat gains because I was too late to hear.
Dwac is at 1.5 bill mkt cap rn. Easily goin to 50 bill

Fuck FB idgaf that some moron commented on some thots post

Fuck TWTR idc if i used a curse word and yes im okay with the tweet

Fuck IG girls dont post enough pics in MFin sandals !!!
Honestly, we were overdue for a correction. 

I‚Äôm actually glad there will finally be some dips to buy now.
Ugh, you prude... Pull out or get out (not financial advice)

We like the stock.
$PHUN üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Your choice but, I believe there is lots of time.
So sad I missed out on mango. Laughed when I saw it up 80% and briefly considered buying. Very poor form. Pls enjoy it for me.
it's been a nailbiter premarket...  trying to swing in and out
You know except literally every outlet has an article about it going up 4 fold yesterday.
Banbet RH halts trading lmao
Suck my mango flavored balls
Buy it now
Just for the record since the corrupt SEC, FBI and CIA don‚Äôt like Mango and are watching, I like the Stonk for its products, message and dominance in the Media sector.   Now I‚Äôm covered.
definitely don't think it's worth it. even if shit runs like crazy again you can may get like a 30% return if you time top perfectly. but there's a huge chance you'll end up losing half your money. if you want big gains today  just get calls on something else. PINS is looking really good today

edit: lmao this thread just a dumbass echo chamber
What yolo 0dte options today wsb??
Did HCA already do ER? I see it‚Äôs down a bit so I assume they did.
Mango mango ah ah ah ah ah

DWAC premarket has old-timey fun feeling memories
I have the same question
Riding into Financial Valhalla on the ü•≠ train!
Once this bitch hits 4am I'm buying 

Don't care price 

Ain't waiting for a dip
The $900 ceiling on Tesla is wild
BREAKING: Filing shows Pelosi bought between $1M and $5M of Mango on October 15th.
Your mom's a DWAC
I think it will run until options are available. That‚Äôs when the real fireworks start.
This episode taught me that I'll buy Satan's stock if it moons ü§£
Nah, I got flagged with good faith violation. Can only trade with settled funds  for another 2 months
Trump pump got me feeling tingly nostalgia
Can I still hop in on mango? Seems like I‚Äôve missed it
Market will go down and the only best play will be Mango stonk.  Milky Way, here we come.
Won't crash
Fruit. Tastes nice
it seems it won't be this time that I will break even on BB üòû
There's a conspicuous undercoverage of mango ü•≠  on financial media.  They can keep this under wraps for long.  When the resnecks from the countryside role in, we're going to Mars.
Dwac
That GME money is sliding into ü•≠‚Äòs DM
DWAC
It's the latest sensation sweeping the nation.
All fomo money is moving in to it.
Referring to everything outside the markets
Pretty sad I hear about a lot of the world events from this page lol. I need to get more informed
Does Google stock not trade in premarket? Or is it just today that there‚Äôs no movement?
Gme again feellsgood
Next time have better plans.
Imo that ship has sailed, baba gonna go uppies from here. Not sure enough to buy calls tho
 what is mango?
We like the stock ü•≠
I cant wait for it to come out that Nancy got in at like 10 bucks.
[deleted]
I think the broker has to have the stock in it's inventory, I'm probably wrong
It was planned
Dwac turned me into a MAGA let's goooo
In theory ya
Should have used a condom
Not an American but watching the political discourse today is some popcorn worthy shit.

That‚Äôs said taking politics out of it those are some nice returns on DWAC at launch. I sure as shit ain‚Äôt touching any SPAC post that much of a launch spike given the last performance. 

Will be watching it for sure. Good luck out there people!
#Short ü•≠, it‚Äôs gonna crash bigly
I don‚Äôt know what market you‚Äôve been looking at, but it‚Äôs been pretty bullish so far this year.
Historical moment and amazing. The future is looking excellent.   Now UK needs to buy more SMRs.

Welcome to the T train !!
The bets aren't "closing" numbers though, its only if it hits that number.  If you said GME 200 1w and it hits 201, but closes at 180 at the end of the week, you would win.
Can someone explain why some apps are slow to put on new tickers but others are fast?

Don't do this to me GME...i stayed with you through the dark times.
This happened before when one of those talentless singers said, ‚Äòwho even uses Snapchat anymore?‚Äô, nosedive into an abyss.
I don't like it. *It makes my ween tingly*
Politics affect the markets, why would we not include facts?  I‚Äôm ready for weed to go up.

TSLA and DWAC
BABA seems like it‚Äôll treat me right today. A real healthy short term relationship

But DWAC... ooh, that crazy ü•≠ got a *dump truck* ass.
Thank you ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
This mango thing is literally destroying the value of every position I have. This is starting to look like a death spiral.
You actually think its gonna moon for 2 weeks?
Premarket opens, I‚Äôm buying more this Train is full steam ahead.
Does this mean it'll climb back up with all the social media platforms?
And with a few taps I don‚Äôt have to use either of those dogshit browsers.
True, although this 7 green days have been suspiciously low volume, still impressive. And yes, my 401k always be buying
Im not a fan of orange man but free money is free money.
Yes
Wirecard
Shorts enabled for mango
My bet is on Norwegian earnings next week.
Around $4.6 profit per piece at open. Congrats and fuck you
I like PLTR the software.  I dont like the stonk anymore.  Best decision of my investing life was paperhanding PLTR on 2/24 for GME when I saw it pop into the 50s.

Mango is gonna be a wild ride.
I‚Äôm dumping my last 300 shares and rotating into ü•≠
Thank you for caring.
Market rises on fear as well as hope.  In fact the market always goes up regardless of any circumstances.
Today
Exp.?
Meteor. Unless it contained a large amount silicon, that would be extremely bullish no matter the body count of its impact.
Ok wut??
I bought a $55.5 put at the top before earnings. Any idea what that will be looking like at open?
It's inseparable from markets
Prob by 1 week
Mom‚Ä¶ why do people price mango at $69.42 per piece? Isn‚Äôt it $0.99 at Food for less?
Yep
is DWAC on fidelity?
Fuck off with that shit. Between those megathreads and RH‚Äôs bullshit it ruined that run.
Up for my son's morning bottle. Crazy that we're going to hit ATH today.
Mango must of did this because he knows Hocus Pocus 2 in the works 

Did a dr. Sleep to Baldwin

And now coming for main Sanderson witch
This guy knows what‚Äôs up üòé
Here you go buttercup r/politics
But I might
Orange man be like: stonks only go up. Look at my stonk.  Up bigly.  Bers r fuk.
DWAC in not on my trading app (etoro)
What exactly would tank this market lol. Pretty much all of that dip in after hours is gone.
Always gotta complicate things
haha just guys being dudes classic
Yes
Dude I want to buy puts on that shit so bad
TRUMP!!!
Don't confuse our love for easy gains with any political leanings.
YUGE
I‚Äôm here. There are a lot of us.
He's real sleepy ...unfortunately
I would say no.  If I say GME closes at 200 on Thursday, but the bell says 180 and my friday open its 210, I still lost.  

Goes by option logic.  For that is the way here.
ü•≠ options wen?!?!?!???!!!?!
So fun and mango are related? 1000% gains today?
[deleted]
WE LIKE THE STOCK!
I love mango

One riding it's coattails for being involved with trump before. Up 350 percent pm  GUH
I don't know.  I cant read.
Something tells me these last two months of the year 

Gonna be like a little mini Armageddon ü§î

Pick a side...and good luck :)
I won‚Äôt.
Good to buy !
Spactacular if you will.
Yupppp webull sucks but least I can play in the mornings. Up 60 percent already
the CNBC dude told me to buy APPLE but i bought MANGO
Agreed. I like money and this is a good opportunity. Stop loss up and I can't lose. I don't give a shit about anything else behind it
RYCEY guy, where you at?
I wonder if my dad would be proud. ü•≠
Don't think Apple can half FB overnight. The reason advertisers flock to FB is because of the ability to precise target their audiences. If they prioritize privacy FB wouldn't have an edge over other social media platforms. 

Also I have 0 faith Mark's metaverse will work out.
Much as I don‚Äôt care for the orange man, the fact remains that the gain on the spac is spectacular.
Who‚Äôs Gary Gensler?
Wow ok "fun" guess I'll go fuck myself for thinking about boarding that PM rocket when my shit broker opens
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/BurnGMEBurn** bet **DWAC** goes from **74.59** to **125.0** before **2021-10-24 04:57:51.332301-04:00**
7 days in a row green. Looking for 8
HAHAHA..


This gave me my best laugh of the whole week!

Thanks :)
Imagine placing puts on spy, thats some burry logic right there
Gensler said we are ok. No collusion here
Just hang around la fitness 

Should be able to catch some tang there
If someone makes a banbet and it hits the target in PM/AH, but not in normal trading hours, does it count as a win?
Nah many of us are fine, but Mango is money. The people saying shit like Trump 2024 though should get banned, but dont kill the Mango hype!!
Yeah! Fuck the HeDgieS!
People with Android don't have any money. Shitty ad segment.
Don't kill it like that
Is it above VWAP?
Mango mango mango

Chill, we like Mango here but uhhhhhh
Thought Elon was the daddy.
It's been a tough year for sure. 

But it's a good company with a bright future.  The stock is only dogshit until it isn't. I felt the same about TSLA when I worked there from 2016 to 2019: an innovative tech company with good leadership and boring stock movement.
The technicals on ü•≠  look good.  Broke thru its 200 day moving average.

Nobody cares about INTC being down 10%. Only memes![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
I don't think so. Just use privacy as an argument. Say every ad is run on individual phones and data never leaves them. Boom. Consumer protection.

Privacy is Apple's greatest strategic leverage. None of the others can claim it. At some point Apple will utilize this to the fullest. They already are. Snap tanking and blaming Apple is just a minor sign. They could eradicate 50% of FB market value in one day. They own the system. The others are just living there for rent. Zuck know this. That's why he want to build his own system, Metaverse stuff.
I‚Äôve been toying with the idea of establishing a hefty position at end of year or q1 next year. How long do you see them continuing to trade sideways before actually making stock gains ?
at least they get to post loss porn on wsb
Time to fomo into ü•≠. Stayed away from stonks for awhile and this is what happened
It‚Äôs already in the works my friend.  They‚Äôre gonna keep halting and halting.
Uh oh looks like the lefty short sellers are trying to cancel the Donald. Keep throwing money in boys!
Not out yet. Probably in 2 weeks.
Mango needs its own megathread
android devices are still the majority of the smart phone market share though
PLTR is dogshit , make gains elsewhere and go back when the fundamentals finally catches up to it's valuation which will start the actual bull run. The people who held PLTR since the start of the year literally lost almost a year worth of gains , huge ass opportunity cost in a bull market.
Mango makes Spacs great again
My Grindr buddies were tossing around my unwashed panties and taking turns wearing them on their head
people said same thing on last earning
Probably have some legality issue behind this plan to flush it out like you envision
$FELCH
Candy corn is violence
Hope it keeps coming down in PM so I can buy more Mango at open before the takeoff
I was 100% invested in PLTR before yesterday. But now I've diversified by buying mango shares, also. 

So this is what it means to be "financially responsible."
Condolences to anyone who played SNAP. Not a nice way to start your weekend.
What's sus?
where do you buy puts?
Send invite
Thank god WSB has embraced politics.
Its just the beginning. Boomers are gonna be rushing in in the coming weeks
Did y‚Äôall see CNBC blame the volatility on the Apes yesterday?!?!  Many didn‚Äôt even know about it
lol it‚Äôs all good bro
Apple could dismantle the whole online ads industry in one single update. That's power. That's why Google is paying them $10 billion a year just to be default browser search in Safari.

It would not surprise me, if Apple went balls deep into the ads space, and singlehandedly forced Google, FB and Snap to pay hefty commissions to do ads on iOS and MacOS. Or simply made their own system and took over the whole industry.

They can do the same thing for ads as they did for music and is doing for games.
imaging mango bailout evergrande
25k at a time
Intel is a good dip to buy IMO
MANGO made him hit the self destruct button
No dude no it won‚Äôt fit in there it‚Äôs too big

We like the stock! ü•≠

Any moron saw that TrumpSpac was going to moon. The real win is selling it at the top and riding puts down to the bottom when it dumps.

Nvm its been, ive been out of loop on the news. Sorry
I concur
Congrats I got SNAP puts but they might not be as juicy as your puts üòè

$TSLA is the ultimate reminder because rich people  were shorting it and not your average 7 figure day trader Andy.
I got it around 15$. I am Deciding if I want to sell now with small loss or wait for BABA to fall.
should it be out by now, if it‚Äôs today, or maybe at market open/right before?
Fomo into 0DTE Tesla 910c and then sell into mangooo

Don‚Äôt forget!!!  DeeWack and Fun go hand and hand!!!

If you want confirmation bias on mango.

Big chunk of family is all about trump.

I told them pre market to buy it. Before I bought. Didn't listen and didn't even know trumpet was even doing TRUTH.

I THEN BOUGHT 450 SHARES.

I told them again they missed out.

Now they are all going to FOMO in at open today. Retards.

Buy more
[This retard that shorted mango at probably like 12 or some shit lost $70k , he closed his short at $14. This is why mango stock had heavy selling pressure at premarket which made me sold the stock for a lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLLJFHKpzd8). I'm laughing at all the retard shorts that got burned yesterday , you know there are definitely some retards that lost more than $70k and blew up their account because of trading halts.
MAGAMAN saving the markets
Oh!!! It‚Äôs not over yet!!
Who gave you the heads up at $9.90? 

I need this hero in my life.

That could pop this bubble,   or people just shake it off and buy more calls. üòÜ
Just for fun bought a $13 OTM 1dte $62 put and It looks like it should be worth $500-600 at open.  Small but insane.
bro if u just bought you probably wouldn‚Äôt be mad
Spy would hit 600 immediately
DWAC retard
I understand the statistics and analysis you‚Äôre bringing to the table‚Ä¶but come on!!!  It‚Äôs Daddy Trump!!!
Or DWAC
MANGO MAN KEEP PUMPINGGGGG TO THE MOOON
What‚Äôs so abysmal about a 120% EPS beat and a 3% revenue miss on estimate but still an increasing revenue‚Ä¶?
Cause we are liiiiving in a Digital World, and I will Acquire Digital gold.
they're definitely getting the 10x the gains compared to everyone in DWAC lol
Bro lmao you‚Äôve been on this sub for a few months? We‚Äôve been like this for years, to be fair we used to have some good DD once in a while, but at the end of the day it‚Äôs all just a casino. This is all fugazi, none of this shit actually works long term, even the so called safe strategies. This is just white collar gambling. If you want to invest this isn‚Äôt the right sub and never has been.
Lol dwac is killing it
Next president
Sir there is hard resistance at 900.

Well...what if we just gap over it ü§î
!ban bet DWAC +25% 1 day
idk, I‚Äôve never tried to short PM. Probably not because it was just some random spac a few days ago lol
What stick is Mango?? What‚Äôs the ticker?
Please no. That was a horrible time.

Truly words I didnt expect to read in 2021.

Yet here I am mad at myself that I only bought 10
you can't trust big tech social media companies
all social media stocks getting rekt in premarket due to SNAP's abyssmal earnings report.
because it went up 360% in one day and is up 44% AH
Probably by open
Yes
I‚Äôll kiss you if you just made me money
I am
i gonna miss it.  non of my brokers have it.

Omg i cant wait till all his base goes all in and then the massive rug pull and cry that its the liberals fault for putting gensler in charge
Yeah I'm waiting b too with fidelity 

Another 2.5 hours to go
This opportunity comes twice in a lifetime
Why is DWAC getting so much hype? I don‚Äôt understand
Honestly GME not having fuckery would be scarier
Yo did any of you have puts on SNAP?

Are you winning?
I was watching and got the heads up at $9.90. But no didn‚Äôt play it because I have a life and a real job to go to
# pound me harder elon
Look on the bright side you can buy at 50 and sell at 100.  That aint bad.

This is totally a P&amp;D but you can't underestimate the Cult of Orange Man.  Like him or hate him i think they absolutely Diamond Hand that shit like GME apes on steroids.
There are people out there that tried to play the snap earnings rather than to hop in with the mango
Poor mango people getting 400%+ gains  lol
Not yet. That's when the real fun starts.
You could wait 10+ years for 700% gains on your boomer stocks (I doubt Tesla will be worth 6.4T in 2031) or you could have bought ü•≠ yesterday at PM and gotten 700% by now.
Yup‚Ä¶same here‚Ä¶along with $PHUN

Mangos spac is worth the 10B market cap loser!
Some of yall didnt follow the old addage, keep your enemies closer.
Still no options right?
Do not miss your chance to mango
Can you even short the mango yet?
Yes buy the top itll go well
You may want to try r/investing instead
Most Trump supporter boomers either have no money, or so much money they have actually smart people managing their portfilios
Mangos have always been my favorite fruit, now I can afford to buy thousands of pounds of them
Easy to see who missed out lmao
I agree 

Here have a MANGO
&gt; Fuck off, you're just a poor person who doesn't understand how the world works.
Buy one fucking ticket bro it‚Äôll be fun
Bears know they are powerless against Mango. They have no argument.
Lol what? Every major retailer uses PayPal. It's 100 times more convenient and safer than having to enter my CC info one by one for bestbuy, target, Microcenter, EA, Steam, Nintendo, ebay, aliexpress and a million other places.

Sounds like you're just broke and never buy shit so you're not PayPals target audience anyway.
Except all the corrupt mfers actually want this to nonstop pump. Gme with no fuckery = wassup lambos
so leave then
This is the GME REWIND!!!!

Ok so let‚Äôs see they are saying that SNAP makes a statement about privacy changes and causes Facebook, Twitter, and Google to drop at close. DWAC runs up 380% and another 100% at premarket open. Hmmmm I wonder why
Su Bae still paying.  ‚ô•Ô∏è
Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs righteous

True, but TONS of Trump supporter boomers will poor their savings into this thing

No they were selling MAGA shirts today next to taco bell. 

I drove right by them 

They were busy 

They will start buying next week!
I‚Äôm done. This whole fucking place is officially a pump and dump wasteland. No real DR that actually means shit anymore.  No sharing strats or any meaningful ideas anymore.

If I could do it again, I could have afforded the low-risk of putting 1/20th of my portfolio in his SPAC, knowing his historic fanatical following
-10% on INTC feels about right if their multiple wasn‚Äôt so low already with solid revenue growth and enterprise GPUs inc 2022. Long dated calls look tempting

Actually the market cap is 7B after merger if it stays at the current price or 14B if they add $825M additional shares. $10 NAV = $875M valuation , it's at 80 right now so $875 x 8 = $7B
My cash still hasn't settled

Tbh 25k in, either go hella up. Or maybe lose 5-6k fuck it
Advertising affects it a lot as well, which is why all the social media platforms are down
Dwac puts
donald pump still doing his thang lol
Come on mahn 

FUKN MANGOS!!!!

Big juicys
Dwac, like lucid is gonna tank post merger announcement. It makes no sense to place this high of a premium on a spac before merger because details of the valuation in the deal are unknown.

A spac is just a pile of money that they are going to give to a company and those spac shares are gonna represent x% of the newly merged company. By paying a premium of 660% you‚Äôre literally saying no matter what valuation the spac and ü•≠ agree to, that you will value it 660% more. No matter what. Of course seeing all this hype for the company, the deal is already gonna come out with a high valuation. Then you are gonna be left holding the bag because the way spacs work is that $10/share is going to be the price that reflects whichever valuation they choose. 

This is exactly what happened with LCID, hylion , and every other spac that had a crazy pre merger run up that fell post merger. Those were memes too at the time but they all tanked because when a company makes a deal valuing itself at X you‚Äôre not gonna find new buyers willing to pay 6X for it right away
They don‚Äôt need 60, they need 10. There‚Äôs 10 democrats interested in breaking up (insert any company here that is worth over 1b). All the republicans would need to do is fall in line. Which they will, if they‚Äôre continually attacked.

No reason to assume what type of content will be on the site. It should look like fb twtr or any other social media site, some crazies, some not.
Im telling you..friday news cycle..major circuit breakers..today is gonna be like gme in jan on roids.
why the fuck etoro does not have it. I need to bagholding trumps stonk.
No one understands how much people love this guy. Im in a rural area and hes 2nd to god to some ppl
Right, he‚Äôs crafted a political meme stock that if it catches on in the right circles on social media could still 10x cuz market cap is still on sub $2B. So many fanstical fans will see it as a test to support Trump

We've got some fine apes ü¶ç.  The best apes in facts.  We know the weak animals, the string animals, the overrated ones.  But when we all come together in one big ü•≠  family, we can do anything.  I really believe that.  God bless America, I love you, good night! üëç
They won‚Äôt ban his social media company unless there is rampant hate speech, calls for violence etc. on the website. If there is, no Democrat will stand up for it, and Republicans will never have the 60 vote filibuster proof votes to actually ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù big tech.
ü•≠ gonna swing like the ape stocks in January. Halts and all. Get your popcorn ready fellas, it's gonna be a great show.

How can you trade and just ignore this lol . This bull is yuge .
Premarket price action on ü•≠ is so much fun to watch
People underestimating the momentum of DWAC thinking its gonna drop. The dude has so many fanatical supporters that are going to be dumping their life savings into it and taking mortgages out on their homes to buy in.
Damn $XLC in shambles
i would but not every fucking broker have trumps stock.
Lmk if u find out
Pull your initial investment and let the rest ride. No losses on the books

So should I FOMO 25k in DWAC tomorrow, either I get a bag or I get fucked. I already got fucked before
Spy
Yep i feel it, spy hits 460 today and mango 350+. Lfg lads strap in
&gt; I'm not sure.
Yes it is.. Social security, Medicare, Medicaid, public education, are undeniably socialist programs. Individuals money is taken from them to purchase benefits on behalf of everyone. The degree to which we have socialism is about half, because the government spends half of our GDP. We could move towards a more free market society or move towards a more socialist society, it‚Äôs not some absolutist system where we are one or the other.

Hi

Would fuck a femgirl
Wouldn‚Äôt be wise, the republicans have already begun to make noise about breaking up big tech, if they continue to be hunted down and censored the intensity of those calls will only increase. It‚Äôs not smart business for private entities to create political enemies. It wouldn‚Äôt be hard for republicans to get democrat support to start breaking up companies, Dems already want that.
But it‚Äôs depends on those and is bound by their ToS lmao

It has all the potential to have a GME type breakout, I'm kicking myself for not finding out about it until today. Have an order for tomorrow morning. Half the country LOVES him like no other. Most of those people don't know about DWAC yet. Once all the news sites start picking up the story, (an you know they can't resist anything trump related), all the boomers are going to know about it. Its the start of the wave.
Add to that, the amount of retards who will short this because orange man bad, you have the potential of an ACTUAL short squeeze.
The chance to 10x is a possibility imo.

The only thing I'm scared of is trump walking back the statement somehow, which is a total possibility.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Has nothing to do with taxes. Only that the gov controls business. I don‚Äôt see the gov taking g over Apple, Microsoft, GM, Ford or Honeywell or any of them. 

Government spending is always a issue that never gets solved. I‚Äôve seen the same arguments going back to when Clinton was president. It‚Äôs all political. That never changes. ü•≠ tax cuts are estimated to adding to the deficit $8 Trillion. Thats from a side all about reducing spending. Their point stands if stop spending money but doesn‚Äôt address the deficit their adding. 

It‚Äôs all bullshit and at this either side is the same. Dems increase taxes and spending. But not enough to offset spending. Republicans decrease taxes but not enough to offset spending. 

It‚Äôs all about having a split Congress like we do now. Nothing gets passed, nothing changes. The market loves that
Probably will come down before that

Increasing taxes, increasing government spending, is socialism. It takes money out of the hands of private individuals and puts it in the hands of public officials to spend on our behalf. Our government spends more than half of our GDP, so we are more than halfway to full on socialism.

a lot of FUD on that one, and that fear dissipated considerably when the CCP suggested they list on the Hang Seng too. I own calls on it myself, and expect it to at least hit its IPO price within a year, if not months. That's my own sentiment, and I'm only wagering a small fraction it

So I opened a brokerage account for my small business because why not. And I'm about to put my entire portfolio towards this new social media stock that's already up 500%. My personal portfolio is made up entirely of WISH. Am I some sort of a genius?
Upside is you won‚Äôt get banned and üåà mod will pin that you won a ban bet and show your record, 1-0
I like how you use your own subjective opinion to objectively classify people based on your own personal metric system to determine who is stupid or not, hands up for this progressive man right here!
Can always check with your brokerage to see if they have shares available to borrow to short. But there may be insane overnight holding fees, im talking up to 40%

I‚Äôm talking about internet money. People who used to call it a bubble and a Ponzi scheme are largely now converts and starting to say that it‚Äôs the future for no other reason than the price has risen so much which is when you know you‚Äôre entering the late stages of the cycle
John Deere should just add stock grants to the factory worker‚Äôs pay. Make them have a stake in the company‚Äôs earnings. Boom, incentives align and everyone should be happy. I work in tech and every engineer is paid in shares along with their salary because they are producing the product. No reason it can‚Äôt be done in other industries too

No. Hopefully grayscale will be able to get GBTC converted to an ETF eventually. BITO being based on futures means it's going to do worse than what it's tracking over the long run. Check out USO versus the price of oil.

Go on :/
You can't buy stock with EBT.
I won‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a bubble but you have mstr issuing debt to buy it and now an etf that buys futures contracts on it. Yet people will attribute fundamental reasons for the ascent in price. Okay fuck it it is a bubble. Just cause price rises for a year doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt come down. When this shit finally breaks its going to be a shit show but an entertaining one
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

I would say because the competition has more room to make up
Same your mom will cum by lunch tmrw
someone's getting banned here
Yeah but Gab is full of literal neo-nazis, plus Trump has major pull and can get his supporters to sign up for dogshit if he wanted to which Gab cant do. In the end though you're right, for as much as people hate each others politics it's what brings debate and views, so this Trump thing will fizzle out at some point, but I still wouldnt try to short it just yet, it's got room to run
Bravo on asana
My Grindr buddies were tossing around my unwashed panties and taking turns wearing them on their head

If Parler is on the shit list of left leaning 'big tech' like AWS, surely this new network will be too.   So what makes this new social network .. work ?   Hosting in Russia ?    Jump on some barely known company like Parler did with Skysilk ?   

I don't see a scalable solution unless Trump is planning to basically build a right-wing empire of internet backbone, search engine, payment provider, etc etc .. which if he's successful at might make him the richest and most influential person in the world .. but its a long long shot.
Drinking white claws and listening to Death Cab for Cutie.  Another great Thursday night
that was not really a miss. they beat EPS by a large margin, and were close on revenue. THey almost doubled YOY revenue.TSLA sank AH too, and had a big volume day, causing tech to sink.ANd then they rebounded while a lot of shit was still red. It looks veerrrrry similar to me.  


The movements bigger because SNAP is extremely volatile.

if you buy $DWAC you‚Äôre a racist
That was 8 months ago and a shit company not even 9 figs
It wasn't a social media site, it was a blog with the comments turned off.  The Trump ecosystem doesn't work without his borderline insane reply guys.  They are the key to value creation here.

Even if you‚Äôre desperate, do you want to be dead broke and desperate? Manage your risk. Put like 10k in it and if it pops take out your own bread and let it ride. If it falls then that‚Äôs too bad but you lost less than a third of your portfolio so you can still recoup.

TSLA is outselling every EV competitor in every market its currently in and will dominate the EV market in Europe when giga Berlin is up and running next year. Your garbage legacy automakers are done for.
I had 10/20 $445 calls that I sold at $447 on 10/18 because I was nervous for a dip on Tuesday. I suck at trading but i like gambling
GME is the best play this year and a top 5 all time.  95% of investors are green on it. 

Fkn dumb ass comment
Tbh, new ü•≠ media venture (social media, TV, events, etc.) is only valued at a few billion. For perspective NFLX is valued at around $300B. The YouTube and YouTubeTVsegment of GOOG is likely worth over $500B by itself. Current value is roughly 50x lower than NFLX. Is it speculative? Fuck yea. Does it have legitimate upside potential from current price? Yea. It also has a spokesperson who, for better or worse, absolutely know how to attract attention. And it has the most meme potential of anything I've seen in a long time. All aboard the mango train! ü§† ü•≠ üöÜ

Tbh I got into the mangosphere early but that's because I live and travel for work to areas outside major cities. Lived in a big city before and some people don't understand how crazy it can get outside the major metros.

Mango hasn't been heard from in months from major networks so of course people are flocking to one that is made by the dude himself. 

Not saying I think it succeeds but people are still pissed and need an outlet, which people are still learning is  a public company under some seemingly random ticker name.

Coke can and it‚Äôs not even close.
Alright I put in for 50 shares on market open.
My ex got a Tesla on June 30th, he wasn‚Äôt supposed to get it until like Aug but one came available and they delivered it to him. If that‚Äôs not dedication to meeting deadlines then you‚Äôre gay

Pretty sure I read the mango play here a day early and ended up google finding an article with the merger company's name. Searched tickers from there. Kinda shitty but the news wasn't everywhere until today.

So I guess you have to dig still which sucks but it's more entertaining than cnbc's website
Could 10x if you go to your mirror at night, close your eyes, and say Donny Pump 3 times before going to bed.
Bruh, it's at a 1.6b market cap. This shit is an easy 200-300x. Easy. Maga dudes literally stormed the fucking capital. You don't think they gonna dump their life savings into mango if he tells them to?

So YUGE, it‚Äôs remarkable really. My friends, and I have smart friends, much smarter than you, say it‚Äôs the greatest most phenomenal stock they‚Äôve ever seen. It only goes up, just look at your 401K‚Äôs. We‚Äôre making some big moves and it‚Äôs just going to be fantastic.

SEC says it mostly went up because positive sentiment. Truth founder has legions of followers many with deep pockets who would have positive sentiment about whatever he put out even if it‚Äôs not worth much.

Donny pump for emperor
$TSLA is the red-headed stepchild of tech with their fake FSD, never delivering on deadlines, weak growth, weak margins and shitty quality.

But somehow all the geeks thinks he‚Äôs hot.
This is irony at its best. The point of truth Twitter is because mango and his supporters got banned because people disagreed with them, so they create their own platform that isn‚Äôt overly censored so they can‚Äôt get banned when people get offended from a tweet

Myocarditis has a higher chance of occurring from a COVID infection. Not from the poke. You sound like that kid athlete from tik tok that blew up when he got it from the jab. 

These risks are known. And treatable when they occur in extremely low chances. They also largely prevent the worst side effects of COVID. Death. 

Anarchy. Cool. Well, because of people sharing your same sentiment, going to be 4 more years of dems in power pushing more vaccination policy.

truth twitter is going to fail as soon as they start mass banning anyone who slightly criticizes mango. how is this not obvious?
Wait so Snap is a data/ads company that can't gather data to sell to advertisers?

How much runway do these guys have?

Should be fine.
Hold them till you retire, or you find a better company. That's the best case scenario. The worst case scenario is hold till you really need the money for something important.
I don‚Äôt care about anyone‚Äôs political stance as long as you make me money
Now he has a stock üôÇ
Exactly. And do boomers even buy options? Going to keep moving up. Wait til the magas get ahold of it. I‚Äôm buying more at open
Yes!! kept commenting on people buying calls or options telling them this exact thing. I didn‚Äôt play Snap but that‚Äôs the same reason why I‚Äôm bearish. It kept surprising me when snap kept climbing during the first tech bull run
Do people here look like they can afford Amazon calls? You answered your own question
Only thing I‚Äôm looking forward to tomorrow is buying some mango. Not really much else to look forward to nowadays. Might even buy 1k worth around open (which I see as a lot). Don‚Äôt have much to lose at this point if it goes down so why not
Market was way more exciting with mango man in charge
that's false, tho. AMD is buying back shares and has super low debt.
Lol no. Just saying they‚Äôre being beat. Not that the market isn‚Äôt irrational.

Facebook is a money machine. Tesla is a Wish product.

But I kinda miss mango after what it did to the market today
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
The amount of pointless comments about this mango shit is ridiculous, reminds me of GME hype. It went up 400% in a day and that‚Äôs crazy and all but half the people commenting probably got in after 20 or 30 and made 200-300% tops, many of them probably made less. And you can‚Äôt buy options on it, so nobody made more than that.

Like yeah it‚Äôs awesome to get a 3-4 bagger but there was less excitement than this the other day when AMZN calls at open turned out to be like 100 baggers or some crazy shit. I don‚Äôt understand

What is the VIX on mango?
"Vaccines don't work and Mango won the election" aren't opinions, they're literally proven lies that lead to people dying. "Big government is good vs big government is bad" is an opinion and you are free to say that shit as much as you like.
This actually made me laugh

You are correct. Already dumped them from my second account. On the primary, got in at 10.70 and out at $15. All in at $20. I tolerated the dilution initially since employees are cashing out, but yeah, at some point this $23-$24 range becomes pathetic. I hope they change their ways soon.

how to explain to my girlfriend that making $600 every 2 weeks, while possible on occasion, is not consistently feasible with an account worth about 12k atm.

The fact that it didn‚Äôt shed any of its 1mo 20% gains, or or 5 day 10% gains. Usually such a rise causes a drop after earnings. When it doesn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs notable.
What do you think warrants are? ü•≠warrants give you the right to buy a share at $11.50 strike with a five year expiry. That‚Äôs why they are up 4,568% since yesterday by the close. So you are kind of clueless.

Nothing wrong with making money. But these same retards going "free speech" will suddenly change their tune when child porn gets passed around on there. Then they'll be like "we didn't mean that kind of free speech!" Same with ISIS communication networks or people calling Mango a dumbass. What they really mean is that they want a safespace to be able to say whatever they want but nobody else.
Why do you think they police the content posted on their platforms? It‚Äôs so they can make money advertising numb nuts. You know. The only way these companies make money. 

üçä will make no money advertising because of the unsavory content. Also becauseüçä followers advertising consists of beer, guns, and fast food. No need to market to these dumbasses. Those ads are always running 24/7 on Fox News and the sports programs they‚Äôre all boycotting. This shit is dead in the water.
I thought PayPal was buying Pinterest at $70/share. Is this free money?
ü•≠ is a sick mofo posting that pig picture.
i'm not so certain it's going down. it's gone up on misses before.
Mango is going parabolic. Buy every dip.

&gt;This [Easy Mango Dipping Sauce](https://homecookingmemories.com/easy-mango-dipping-sauce/) is fresh and fruity! Pair it with *chicken tenders*, fried shrimp, grilled fish ‚Äî or anytime you want tropical flair added to your meal.
You don't have to be a SNAP bull to know that 25% was a wild over-reaction. Easy swing trade opportunity here.
I love $PLTR as a company. I brought in 12‚Äôs and sold around 23. I‚Äôve become more of a value investor and don‚Äôt follow hype anymore. They keep diluting shares which shows to me they don‚Äôt respect shareholders. But they‚Äôre an amazing company. Will defo look to buy some if it falls below 7-10 if it ever gets there. Love the company, hate the stock
Imagine thinking all EV's are going to be the same "luxuriousness"/price range and not a multitude of different levels at different prices like gas cars are now

 &gt;Tay was an artificial intelligence chatter bot that was originally released by Microsoft Corporation via Twitter on March 23, 2016; it caused subsequent controversy when the bot began to post inflammatory and offensive tweets through its Twitter account, causing Microsoft to shut down the service only 16 hours after its launch. According to Microsoft, this was caused by trolls who "attacked" the service as the bot made replies based on its interactions with people on Twitter. It was replaced with Zo.

Got out of the first two since they peaked. ROKU especially once they ended their HBOMAX dispute. They hit $420 but nowhere to go. 

Now I am all in PLTR. I might add more but need to see where the inflation is headed.

No one talking about Evergrande?  I've been hearing it was this harbinger of the end of the global economy for so long.  It's kinda nice to have something positive so far.
What's your reasoning? I highly doubt that. The F150‚ö° doesn't really have competition aside from Rivian for all of next year at least. The worst thing about ford was the charging network but with Tesla opening their supercharging network to other manufacturers that's gone. I'm betting after the F150‚ö°, there will be an EV bronco, and an F150‚ö° Raptor announcement will shoot them well past 20.

I doubt contractors are gonna go for this one so it's really just a small niche of people who want a truck and want to also make it electric?

How was a "prop gun" able to kill someone?
[deleted]
WHAT DO THEY MEAN
There's no projectile on the end of a blank round.  Its supposed to be a cartridge primer and small amount of powder.  Just enough to cycle another round, thus they are much shorter and if a live round was loaded into a prop gun, the slide wouldn't cycle and it would jam.

Which is why I think the studio will be sued to oblivion because they probably didn't use prop guns

You honestly come off like the type we would want to avoid.
Friday morning to do list: FOMO plays and don‚Äôt have an exit strategy.
&gt;improperly-made dummy rounds, cartridges from which the special-effects crew had removed the powder charges, so in close-ups the revolver would show normal-looking bullets. However, the crew neglected to remove the primers from the cartridges. At some point before the fatal event, one of the rounds had been fired; although there was no powder charge, the energy from the fired primer was enough to push the bullet into the gun barrel, where it got stuck (a condition known as a squib load). For the fatal scene, which called for the revolver to be fired at Lee from a distance of 3.6‚Äì4.5 meters (12‚Äì15 ft), the dummy cartridges were replaced with blank rounds, which contained a powder charge and primer, but no bullet, allowing the gun to be fired without the risk of an actual projectile. When the blank round was fired, the bullet lodged in the barrel was propelled forward with almost the same force as if the round were live

Nah prop guns are chambered smaller than a live round, and also have other safety mechanisms so a real round can't be accidentally loaded into them, specifically to avoid this.

So they either used real guns with a bunch of idiots who have no reason to be touching them, or someone shoved some shit in the barrel idk.

My dad coached my little league team when I was a kid.  I never actually cared about baseball, but my dad loved it.  I was the only boy my parents had so naturally I was pushed to play.  One day, my dad picked up from school mid-day and took me to a Mariners game.  We were in the nosebleeds, and never even got 50ft close to a catching a ball.

As we walked out, a man gave my dad a signed Ken Griffey Jr. ball.  That man was Bill Gates.  It was an incredibly day for me, but also for my dad who worked a blue collar job at Microsoft.  They are going to bury me with that ball, my $MSFT shares, and a photo of my first dog Maple.

Ehhhh. Idk man. If they F over all social media platforms with rule changes I would not call them safe in the short term... And the chip shortages are a really big mid-term issue...

First of all, I gotta say a big thank you to everyone who gave insights into the credit repair job of the hacktivist "ROYALBLADE". I tried out of faith in the success stories I've read here and on YouTube about the expertise of this dude. I‚Äôm so glad I did as I've just witness a good day in my life. I woke up having 797 credit score this morning. Wwhhhaaaaaatt???? Ikr I'm like is this dude legal?  like, what damn methods does he use? Super fast!!!! His CREDITBOOSTFOCUS page on FB is where i found him.

One of them was struck in the shoulder and another one in the stomach. Makes sense to me, when you stand behind someone who‚Äôs sitting down your abdomen is right at shoulder level of the other person.
You can wheel it but the 10% drop on paypal and 25% on snap will still hurt whoever wrote put options extremely. It's going to take a long time to recoup what was loss.
&gt; I'm not going to get into the specifics of my trading. I am a professional trader and it would be unethical for me to disclose that information on a public forum like this without permission from my firm's compliance department.

Quite the opposite. You can roll out those puts + selling calls in attempts to salvage the trade. Or you can just hold on and let Thera decay work in your favor. As long as you weren‚Äôt a fucking muppet and sold a bunch of puts you should be fine.

Or you can even take assignment and write cover calls if you sold puts.
Ooooh spooky

 &gt;Brandon Bruce Lee (February 1, 1965 ‚Äì March 31, 1993) was an American actor, fight choreographer, and martial artist. Establishing himself as a rising action star in the early 1990s, he landed his breakthrough role as Eric Draven in the dark fantasy film The Crow (1994). Lee's career, however, was cut short by his death during The Crow's production. He was the only son of martial artist and film star Bruce Lee, who died when Brandon Lee was eight years old.

Yea there are tons of misleading "financial news" headlines and social media chatter about insider ownership where people have no clue what they are talking about. I sifted through a lot of this stuff on PLTR so I know what to look for now. Between reading the SEC form 4s and understanding beneficial ownership, and also cross-referencing with the S-1 (which often touches on current and future executive compensation), you kind of get an idea of the real insider ownership. It's pretty complicated usually for companies that recently went public
Yup, go ahead and open up. Cry about your lost tendies, so that we can make u feel better.

The stock is challenging to remove entirely, and honestly, people seem really excited to talk about it so why not let them while it runs its course? Probably won't be too long, but who knows.
Oh you hit it really big on two meme stock. Congrats! I also held GME and TSLA (and now AMC that's up 180%) but I had a very low starting capital so I'm still not there yet.

if you go down to table 2, you get an idea for how many shares he holds by adding up what's in column 9 that has a unique footnote. There are rules for when certain options start counting as beneficial ownership, so it may be incomplete. But that's sort of the minimum amount of shares he owns. something like 35M shares
Dude What A Cunt
About 3 years. Biggest single winner has been GME. Cleared over $115k during the meme run. TSLA has also been a big winner. Bought in during last March's crash and have been holding and adding to my position since. Currently up over ~$135k with it.

Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.
Baldwin would 100% not be held responsible. If anyone it would be the prop master, if they were to go after individuals and not the production company. No one would though. No one went to jail for Brandon Lee‚Äôs death.

In order to be born, you needed:

2 parents
4 grandparents
8 great-grandparents
16 second great-grandparents
32 third great-grandparents
64 fourth great-grandparents
128 fifth great-grandparents
256 sixth great-grandparents
512 seventh great-grandparents
1,024 eighth great-grandparents
2,048 ninth great-grandparents
 
For you to be born today from 12 previous generations, you needed a total sum of 4,094 ancestors over the last 400 years.

Don't say yes to that, she's just looking to cheat on you while justifying it
but some of us had the misfortune of being born in china
For China yes as of now.
After hours saw it drop .50c, almost hoping it goes close to $20 so I can buy more
Where are you seeing this?
Yes.  It was priced in.  It‚Äôs already been known the CCP wasn‚Äôt going to let it collapse.  That‚Äôs why no one has been talking about it as a problem the past few weeks.  It still doesn‚Äôt change the property issues in China or their regulatory crackdowns or their own inflation issues or their general slowdown in economic activity.  ATHs is laughable for them right now.
How could you not be all in on mango social stock...

I have a brain dead tuckponting job that I half ass and never lift anything more than 20lbs (make the younger guys do it) but it's 40$/$ full benefits and 4weeks pto. I mean my body has the wear and tear from the first 15 years of construction but nowadays if you're with a good company you'll be safe with minimum body damage and start at 25$. But starting at the great salary for a nice chair job or an AC environment and not having to worry about hurting yourself. As long as you can double that within 10 years I say sure

When I have a shitty day and just fucking unload my problems verbally onto someone else, it makes me feel way better.  But when I listen to someone bitch and moan about shit, like really listen, at the end of it I feel like garbage.  Way lower mood, negative, and drained.

AMD is the move. Always has been and always will be.
Or the walking dead....
Given the run up to earnings, you can argue a earnings beat is already priced in.

However, Intel doing bad is likely bullish for AMD. 

Even if it retreats a little post earnings, the next catalyst  would be merger announcement which is expected to be announced Dec/Jan.

So I'm going to hold my position through earnings. Not even planning to sell covered calls. Got destroyed having to buy them back last earnings.

Bro that‚Äôs your personal evaluation. But in reality it‚Äôs not overvalued, it‚Äôs undervalued. Secondly their products are exactly the same like Invisalign and on top of that they are affordable and convenient to order from home, dental offices or SmileShops (their own shops). They are opening more and more stores in the US and internationally. Expanding their partnerships with local dental offices. Their products are available in Walmart, Target, etc. Recently they announced their SmileBus which goes from cities to cities around the country offering their services‚Ä¶.

I'd definitely hold some. Consider today's action the equivalent of the $20 -&gt; $40 GME pump the weekend before it left the stratosphere. The stock is known but isn't fully mainstream yet.
Good point. looks like im a rep for the time being.

So I told my dad this morning about mango since he loves trump. He ended up hopping in at $18 with $80k and selling at $40. I got in at $12 and sold at $44 for a nice $50k. I told him the stock was prob gonna die into close and he said ok. I text him later and am like wow it‚Äôs at $72 in AH, he calls me and reminds me I told him about trump Warrants and he tells me he bought 5000 at close üòÇ he was worried cause it dropped 10% the last 5 mins but now it‚Äôs up 100% AH

Lol. Remember though that lack of liquidity will make orders at the mark slow, which is why many people set limits to buy sell so much higher/lower than the actual mark in order to get filled quickly. Which is why AH candles look retarded.

So if you place an order an nothing happens it‚Äôs because liquidity is often low as fuck.

You have to pay attention to rising stocks both volume and %. Just check when you can.

The news came out last night , you had fking 12 hours to prepare to buy at premarket , when it opened at 7am premarket for most brokerage there was heavy selling pressure which drop the price from 12.40 to 10.40 , I sold at the bottom because I thought the hype wasn't there , turns out I was just too early and most retards are just insanely late to the news. Missed out on massive gains oh well.......

TLRY don't tease me like that AH I'd rather it tank and have no hope for my 12c gamble tomorrow.

You will bounce back King. Hang in there.

TSLA 0dte calls take me to Valhalla
Typical
So did SNAP cause the dip in SPY?
There were actual retail investors who sold every stock they owned when Mango lost cause he said market would crash. There are a lot of people who would throw their life savings into Mango Man Stock because he's promising to take on Twitter, Facebook, Netlix, Amazon, etc. $1000 is NOT a meme
Think ü•≠ is dumb but bought stock because maga boys are rabid and will pump this shit to the moon. I like my money and don‚Äôt care how I get it.
Limit order, and TIF as either EXT or AM.
I do too they only let you do [select securities](https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/after-hours-trading.html) PM or AH, zero of which are fun.

Volatility
I think they're talking about mango futures, but I can't find them anywhere. Some super secret futures trading platform that's not allowed here or something.
If you work at a restaurant, I feel bad for you
Sigh. I first saw it at $39 and said I missed out. Now I‚Äôm hearing guys like you who want in at $70 plus.
Mission confirmed.
Sad a that I missed the Mango pump today. How do people get notified of this news so quickly? I need some sort of phone notification...
Yes it will be Parler2.0 ‚Ä¶ but not right away.  At launch it will skyrocket up the App Store ranks and probably keep surging.  Eventually people will get bored and delete it - plus trumps base is addicted to FB - they won‚Äôt leave because their non-MAGA family and friends are on FB

I think there will be a bubble once *technology* applications start doing things similar to financial institutions, like loaning out lots of money and storing it, *but* *like*, none of it is federally insured  
 
 It'll probably be several years though.. I imagine it having a fancy name like " *FinTech* "
Who knows, market crazy as hell!
Lol like trading AH is some elite unobtainable status.
FUCK YES SPY 500 EOM
How?
Jppw speaks? Sweet Jesus sell everything
You make a great point. Maybe ill mix it up with shares here.
Yeah saw it at $19 and just assumed it would crash
Politics completely aside, seeing TSLA have this much success, it is wild to think that the White House snubbed Elon from an EV summit when he controls over half the EV market.
So SNAP calls Tom morning?
[deleted]
You retards actually think we‚Äôre in ü•≠ for the long term? üòÇ
Getting drunk. Getting high. Watching Spy Kids 2. Shits garbage. It‚Äôs pretty good tho.
This has the potential to make GME look like SNDL, if you know what I‚Äôm saying‚Ä¶
Thankfully we are in a country where that‚Äôs the case‚Ä¶ but there‚Äôs also an electoral college that can potentially trump the popular vote. So we‚Äôve come full circle.
Dude my throat knotted. Holy fuck. So fucked
I smell bullshit. Sorry just not buying it.
Same here haha cheers
It‚Äôs smelling like A Make America Great Again day tomorrow
I won't buy under $80. Our president is worth at least $80 a share.
Deez nuts
I agree that it‚Äôs undervalued but it can stay that way for a while. A two day play on calls won‚Äôt have reliable multiple expansion to fair value. I‚Äôm just going to be buying shares here. Similar reason to why I bought baba shares during the crash instead of calls.
You can buy premarket you just need to change the order terms.
Foldy samsung phone is so wack imo

The tech is pretty neat and impressive tho
Possibly.
Mango is gonna make wallstreet his bitch tomorrow!
[deleted]
I‚Äôm liquidating a lot tomorrow to rotate
I thought it was up uranus
I *almost* cried
It's called green
Better throw another imüçëment at him
SNAP calls at open or wait a few days?
SPY
I literally saw it announced on Twitter yesterday and I set the buy order right then
Haha guaranteed. I bet its trending rn
He‚Äôs such a moroon.
I love a good mango BlackBerry smoothie
During GME every other stock crashed. Tomorrow same thing will happen. Everyone plowing into Mango Man stock
yep if you got money people will come money is the cure to everything
Are you dense? It‚Äôs past mars already ü§°
Rotation into ü•≠
True.
People who get the vaccine should be comforted that they have it and it will protect them. People who choose not to get it should be allowed to do so with no discrimination but also have to live with any potential consequences. And honestly people who get it have the potential for consequences too
I put the tractor in the garage, fed the pigs, had a beer, watched Tucker Carlson and then heard the news, I'm in tomorrow for sure.
A lot of people are gonna buy puts
&gt;CHINA EVERGRANDE GROUP HAS SENT FUNDS FOR BOND COUPON DUE SEPT 23 TO TRUSTEE -SOURCE no default

^FXHedge ^[@Fxhedgers](http://twitter.com/Fxhedgers) ^at ^2021-10-21 ^21:48:25 ^EDT-0400
I felt this...
Dude dont ruin the fun
They'll be enabled soon
I wanna short it so bad
Trump and dump? Don‚Äôt care, bring me the tendies
So my January $1500 calls gone print???
Always get in when rumblings are there, but low. I got in at market open based off last night when there was lots of low rumblings.
In my opinion, they are though, but I believe he should have the same voting power as me.
BB obv
Well, the stock doesn't have options....unflaired one.
Options aren't even a thing on it yet so there goes puts theory
seething with jealousy. good shit bro what was the strike/exp? and can I have $20?
Appreciate you looking out ü§ôüèΩ
Exactly. I‚Äôm here for the money.
Does anyone have some of that‚Ä¶ presidential sharpie.. I need to pencil in some extra zeros for my portfolio.. commit to the **truth**!
Politics aside, its a meme nobody bought it for its value...like all memes it will die
üòÇ
What happened to SPY AH?
!banbet Dodgers in 7
Just went to the grocery store.  Prices on mangos were up 360% since yesterday.  Thia inflation is getting out of control.
Sensing rotation into mango tomorrow
GOGGLE

Edit: I got edit sniped and now I look like a goof
Not gonna hold through earnings. But FB is now undervalued
Ofc it‚Äôs going to die but the profits I made today will live
K so put your life savings on that then?
People will go to TWTR to talk about ü•≠
TLRY
January
Long term - yes 

Short term-üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Just wait n watch, elon is going to disclose in the next earnings call that he bought $1B of ü•≠ stock and added $100b market cap to TSLA
It is for me
Remember when everyone starts Reeeing about a stock it's time to do the opposite
Please wait until after earnings or do a debit spread instead. I hate watching people get IV crushed through earnings. The report is Monday.
Gay as fuck we do options
Hey, what is a divs?
By literally shorting it
Just because they don‚Äôt match YOUR opinions doesn‚Äôt make them terrible.
[deleted]
Lmao
Even better bro the graphics are insane
I only want to get paid. I don‚Äôt care about anyone‚Äôs politics and safe spaces
Bias aside, here's why ü•≠ stock will fail:

Trump followers don't really give a shit about discussing idealogical beliefs - they care about owning the libs. There will be no libs to own. The entertainment value will die quickly and so will traffic.

Puts on ü•≠, calls on Twitter.
TSLA 1000c 10/22 is only $10. Literally free money! Can't go up tits!!
Horses require too much maintenance and aren‚Äôt as fast
There's a casino that's open 24/7 but most WSBers can't stomach it

Edit: also you spelled lose wrong fucking idiot
SNAP puts was there easiest money I‚Äôve ever made
I don‚Äôt know why you automatically assume that I don‚Äôt know market cap. Yeah i get that, like same reason people asking why chipotle trades higher than AAPL?  I‚Äôm not talking about that
&gt; I'm in the front office of a hedge fund.
Mouth to Lung
Fuck ya all in!
position? Just wondering because I‚Äôm going all in on ü•≠
I mainly use TD Ameritrade
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
!banbet ü•≠ 420.69 1w
Yeah losing all your money on a sketchy pump and dump linked to China will sure show them üá±üá∑
Probably frozen and glitchy
You know you can get the whole slab right?
I tried but I think you can‚Äôt
Yep. 4,000% if you bought the warrants.
One meme to rule them all
He pulled his people out of stimmy talk negotiations and spy dropped a couple percent only to pull a oh you fuckers misunderstood me and reversed it all in futures the same day.
&gt; no, money can't cure crippling loniness
Dow futures green when everything else is red‚Ä¶hopefully my BA calls pump tomorrow
Reminds me of the UPST guy. I can‚Äôt hear you, you‚Äôre breaking up.
Are they though? People will never learn to operate such complex contraptions
the ban is because you don't understand the concept of market cap. goodbye
That would be pretty neat
Close RH and move to a real broker
So money is supposed to cure crippling loneliness right?
So I heard I‚Äôm putting all the money I‚Äôve been saving into MAGA stock is this true?
Same. Right wing nut jobs will get it shut it down within 3 months
Someone is gonna loose a lot of fucking money on ü•≠ but fuck it, open the casino. I need my fix
 Fb and twitter are good ideas.  Just be sure to not actually hold through their earnings though
Haven't seen any ü•≠ banbets? Do it! You won't.
$WISH me luck
So what are my chances of Mango coming on tv smoking a fatty like Elon.  Maybe then my TLRY would finally moon.  Damn it man.
Before the dip!
I call that today. He said tomorrow.
CNN : ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs racist and manipulated stock strikes again!‚Äù
[deleted]
I love how literally everyone is talking about one stock and it can‚Äôt even be mentioned here. Tomorrow is gonna be crazy, I think we see $150
This stock is completely driven by news. If they get an emergency approval, the stock will moon, especially given how beaten down it is. At least that is what my smooth brain is telling me.
Massive liquidations to free up cash to go into ü•≠. Could drop the whole market
&gt;same price as TWTR and SNAP

#BAN
I have no idea what MTL is or does but I bought 10 shares when I saw it trending one day and had some spare change so I said fuck it. I have been buying 10 shares weekly since then because it just keeps going up. I‚Äôm at 200 shares and am up 50%, still no idea wtf they do
THX PREZ as the license plate, too.
I believe so, but most of us can‚Äôt buy till 9:30 ü•≤
I watched it all day waiting for it to cool down...it never did. Still made a a few k from 36-51 but damn it could've been an insane day
Mango contango
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Property developer China Evergrande Group has made funds available for a bond coupon due Sept. 23 to a trustee account on Thursday, before the expiration of a 30-day grace period for the payment, a source told Reuters on Friday.

Guess we have to wait a little bit longer.
Like I‚Äôve been telling you all for a year now, motor cars are the future
I'm sorry. I'll do better. All the alcohol is offsetting the coke I do all day.
[deleted]
What is ü•≠
oh SNAP
Total value trap.
It's also just inefficient and unattractive
Re enter
Everyone used their Biden bucks to buy trump bucks
Wish she still acted. She was great.
Burry and Cathie hate fucking while watching the mango live chart.
Problem is some people refuse to get vaxxed and then die. If you're in a position of power to change that and you're a decent human being that shits gotta weigh on your conscience right?
I weigh 320 pounds but your mom knows that already
yes but we couldn't gamble on it. if that blog allowed us to attempt to exploit trumps rube army it would be bigger than facebook
Bank earnings will send moon mission.
That was fun
Show us where SNAP touched you.
[deleted]
even a caveman would know about ü•≠ after a 400% day like today
‚ÄúMANGO MAN STOCK TALKS GOING GOOD ‚Äú
Mango? The one that‚Äôs cheaper than coins? Lol
It‚Äôs not SNAP that broke the market, it‚Äôs the ü•≠ stock, money that were parked in FB TWITTER SNAP etc rotated into that stock and now it trades around the same price as TWTR and SNAP in one day. 

I‚Äôm also high so‚Ä¶
Spy is back to where it fell 
Break through 457 or sell off??
$COIN is the proof to Fermat's Last Theorem.  It is the fountain of youth.  It is an eternal flame.  $COIN is the bumblebee that pollinated your wife's wedding bouquet.  It is a white tiger that uses humans as props in its magic routine.  Take a deep breath and let the waves crash into you.
I wish the real world were as smart as this community. My people fr ü§å
proud
Yeah let‚Äôs just be 1/5th SNAP and close Monday at $675
These people can't read. Why link to an article?
Onto the next one
I'm trying
Remember how Mango would talk about the market and it would always go up last year! He was the best at calling the bottom.
Fat
Sounds like paper hands to me
Mango gango or Mang gang
I know this is a Trump and Dump and I don‚Äôt care.
That‚Äôs me all the time.  Now I just yolo
Pork belly is just thicc bacon
Somehow the media will report this as a Trump-led insurrection on Wall Street
just short it dawg
There will be many to follow. This will become an emotional political battleground and I love it
famous last words as every middle american blue collar family opens up their savings accounts to fomo into ü•≠
Same here brother, I saw it at $18. Kicking myself but still a lot of potential
I think there was a sub created that was banned within 13 hrs.
That's not unpopular, square faces are just typically for more formal pieces at least when it comes to non smartwatches
üçÜü•≠üò©
How can you short it? It just opened today and there are no options available.
Oct 12 hang seng was +1%, SPY ended -.5% 

Take it as you will
how do I get over the fear of knifing???paper handed mango like a little bitch. Held a 1000 shares sub 13.. and sold way too early ‚ò†Ô∏è
does anyone with Charles Schwab know if you get a temporary digital debit card while the actual card is being delivered?
#MANGO MAN BACK
Going all in on FB a calls at open
[deleted]
Being fat is bad for the environment. Not just a health issue. Stop being a glutinous fuck
Is ü•≠ open to trade on premarket?
Who decides who is smart and stupid? And how do you measure that? Many smart people have terrible political beliefs, like Burry.
SNAP is $118b.. by that standard, ü•≠ is way undervalued
Would sell my warrants so fast for calls
I‚Äôd say 35%, the MMS know it‚Äôll run up a shit ton tomorrow and Monday so
I'm gonna buy calls day of earnings. I don't usually hold past ER, but FB is down so much that they gotta gap up. Unless they totally bomb it on Monday.
I'm going to go post this over there. I'll get banned but that sub is done now that it's concluded
So I hate to burst everyone‚Äôs bubble, but you realize Mango Man already had a ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù platform of his own that shut down after 29 days because nobody read it right? Call me when you can buy puts on it.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/02/trump-blog-dead/
What, like ban it?
Why is the Dee DoubleU Ah Cee banned from WSB?  Honest question. It was the most traded stock today.
Why are bacons thin.

Look here. Last bank earnings day SPY ran $7+
Put leaps on Facebook and Twitter feel like a 10 bagger
I saw it at $39 for the first time and said fuck I missed out. I swear I hate missing out almost as much as losing money.
Unpopular opinion: I prefer square watches over circle
Did he mention it?
ü•≠
Mango top is in when I see a "ü•≠ go brrrr" billboard in Times Square
Tech is what matters
Finally banned from the conspiracy subreddit lol
You‚Äôre gonna fuck yourself if you do üíÄ
My point is, smart people do important things‚Ä¶ dumb people do stupid things. So everyone‚Äôs voice shouldn‚Äôt and doesn‚Äôt carry the same weight. End of story.
Alright I have done my DD (take a guess as what DD stands for). We are going big on ü•≠. I am sick of watching SPY turtle every day, gets so boring. We need some action in our lives.
Buy Mango stock! Its the future!
Booooooo
Mango
Saw SPY‚Äôs market close price, got stoked. Saw SPY‚Äôs current AH price, got depressed.
HBO
Imagine fomoing to ü•≠ tomorrow. It‚Äôs gonna crash soon
I'm thinking there is a high likelihood that someone here was on an episode of To Catch a Predator. No show yourself at least you got laid some until Chris Hansen fucked it up for you.
What ever happened to diamond hands?
On what? A üçã?
Thanks for stopping by.
?
If ü•≠ can just be 1/5th the value of the value of TWTR we‚Äôd be looking at roughly $325 a share
They‚Äôre so aesthetic. I want one in an office room one day just to sit in and read in

Haven‚Äôt seen that one yet, but my god Bela Lugosi made a great Dracula‚Ä¶.. Sad he only played Dracula once more after the original
I loaded up massively on CLF 1DTE calls. Tomorrow morning is earnings. I'm gonna be a hero (or depressed).
You missed out on 400% today.
Mango
DWACing off all damn day
Not in USA
Can you imagine if we can start a campaign to convince boomers/conservatives that they can pwn libtards by buying mango?

This shit can go to 1000
It is already on the moon.
Fine, Florida
We hitting $465 tomorrow. 

AND I AIN‚ÄôT TALKING BOUT SPY 

ü•≠üöÄ
When do the boomers get that social security bump
Short mango stonk tomorrow at open
Which banks
If in 2016 someone told you that we would have Mango as president and then we would have a Mango stock that would moon ~~~69%~~~ ~~~420%~~~ ~~~600%~~~ **BIGLY** in a single day, would you believe that it‚Äôs from the timeline you were living in?
What's all this I'm seeing about üçã
Can‚Äôt wait to get a red lambo and paint MAGA across the hood!

Everyone buy WISH tomorrow!
It is. And it‚Äôs unprecedented. Hasn‚Äôt happened for REAL since early 1900‚Äôs. And life is a whole lot different now than it was then. 
The answer is simple: encourage people to get it, but don‚Äôt force it.
For real though 

Remember when any stock he briefly said on national television would fucking go parabolic the next day ü§£ü§£

Ppl too comfortable. It's been going down to 14-15 before shooting up to 20-24
If this breaks $100 tomorrow, let‚Äôs build a Donnie pump statue on Wall Street
Not saying they're right im saying I can't believe everyone just slept walked directly into it. I feel 0 sympathy

OH...Hey what's that? TOMAHAWK CHOP!! pew pew
Been playing them since I randomly bought calls on them last Friday. Got a huge gain on Monday exited been buying dips and getting out
People take profits.

Nah, I'm good on that one.
I didn't play it but what do call call +400% on shares
I‚Äôm gonna be behind the Wendy‚Äôs dumpster if I can‚Äôt roll these SNAP credit spreads out
&gt; I'm not concerned about the SEC.
I was planning on selling at the end of the day, but then a co-worker came into my office just before 4pm and I got distracted. I'm nervous for tomorrow.
We're cool. Just watch yourself...

üçª
Keep telling yourself that.
It did very briefly but it got banned by admins. That's as much as I can say if I know what's good for me.
How likely is it for MM to have options for ü•≠
It'll be very soon.
You have to use google dawg. Probably can test them out in all major cities.
GUYS sorry am late for the party. Got held up by some BOOMER work people. What is ü•≠????
Wait until the SEC investigates it and flips it‚Äôs dick out
0DTE day tomorrow boys. Were legends are made and new Wendy's employees as well. Let's  get it üò§
ü•≠!
I have Embody. Its good.
You would love  in up here in New England.
Lmao I love those types of jobs
Nah, everyone's voice means something, even if they are idiots.

Chaturbate is going public? Sheeesh they probably make shit tons of money
Government just wants people to get vaccinated to save lives. Dunno what correct call is...tough situation.
What does that have to do with anything? I genuinely have no clue what point you're even attempting to make.
I just watched *Dracula Prince of Darkness* (1966) with Christopher Lee, it was apparently the third movie in that Dracula series but I haven‚Äôt seen the first or second. Prince of Darkness wasn‚Äôt too bad though
Say it louder for the permabears at the back!
Anyone who thinks for themselves can see Biden is a puppet
#best part is hang seng is green and bank earnings tomorrow. $460 Gauranteed.
And once again, there‚Äôs plenty of people with all kinds of different beliefs, but the fact is, they‚Äôre dumb and or not important‚Ä¶ therefor their voice doesn‚Äôt mean shit
If you feel sad about missing 600% gains on ü•≠ , at least you weren't the person who trades on emotion and blew up their account by going short on ü•≠ just because they hate him.
A buddy of mine just told me that his pastor texted him and said ‚Äúshould I buy trump‚Äôs stock‚Äù

BULLISH
Yh my spy puts r not looking cute

Yea, was so scared to leave it over night‚Ä¶. As I‚Äôve been screwed in premarket one to many times
I get banned all the time. Those apes like me
Buying more HUT. I tried to tell you all to buy HUT many weeks ago. Most didn‚Äôt listen and you missed out on massive gains. I am now telling you again to buy HUT, but you will not listen again and will miss out on even more massive gains.
I bought a bunch of fds at the bottom of the first dip. Felt so smart for an hour

Tried an embody last year, sent it back and got a staples memory foam office chair - way more comfortable
I have the Aeron. If you like to sit with one leg under the other just be mindful that you can't really do that with it since the plastic digs into your leg. Other than that it's nice.
Oh, like a bisexual‚Ä¶. Nice‚Ä¶..
Think we‚Äôll get the morning pump on FCEL to offload the calls I bought at close?
Lol @ all the people who think mango is going to the moon tomorrow
Hehe noice
Everyone on Twitter is such a dumbass 

If you don‚Äôt let these worthless politicians cheat in the stock market, they won‚Äôt care about it at all. 

When they don‚Äôt care at all, you‚Äôll start seeing insanely idiotic rules start getting passed about it, like taxes on unrealized gains. 

Why would they care.
Nope they haven't even started filming part 2 yet, waiting to see the box office on 1....weird thing, Stings character was completely written out
We are all on borrowed time
Tomorrow's discussion is about Bank of International Settlements. Shouldn't move the market too much.

It will have 1% of the user base, and be worth 1% of real social media companies until Trump is gone at which point it will evaporate before our eyes
The entrepreneur mentality is a beautiful thing
Remember, all people who are spamming tickers already bought and are holders...they are not gonna buy...they are looking to sell

HBO is owned by Warner who owns nearly everything lol I think zero people involved of making one movie were involved in the making of the other
Just wait until they get their paychecks and instant deposit that shit through RH
Nah he‚Äôs just excited he gets to eat this weekend
Who do you think you are bro?
Calls would've been lovely
28mil float that traded nearly 500 mil.
Yolo'd $20,000 into December $200 calls on $NVAX. Wish me luck.
Nah that‚Äôs the play.  It‚Äôs nuts to hold this spac - you might get another bite of the Apple FrIDaY bc people won‚Äôt hold over the weekend
Remember when circuit breakers actually existed? God I miss those times. They were mystical nights. Sleeping right next to a rope.
Holding over the weekend was some nerve racking shit though. Such a bizarre thing the difference between making and losing money is whether the president goes nuts on Twitter.
He‚Äôs talking to some bankers he‚Äôs not gonna say anything meaningful
Big hairy man

$COIN $COIN $COIN this stock is like an undiscovered Beethoven symphony.  It is like seeing Halley's comet twice.  It is like playing with your childhood dog.  Take a sip of Cabernet Sauvignon and enjoy the ride.

Almost every trade this week, I've managed to sell the very top. I'm so fucked next week...
Eh, Star Wars is a fun space fantasy. Dune is a commentary on the relationship between oil, politics, religion, and neo-colonialism dressed up in sci-fi clothes. Star Wars was influenced by Dune, but it‚Äôs not really fair to compare the two considering that the latter is a much more serious work.

Sometimes you get triaged to their side in the ED. Sometimes you‚Äôre admitted to a department where the NP tries to admit you. People have the option to request for a doctor in those instances. 

They also cost to the patient the same, NPs will just order more unnessary tests and offload many off the costs to the patient vs the hospital.

Hoping FB makes some recovery tomorrow after following that SNAP drop. Holding a bunch of 10/29 $330c that were doing okay. If gets back up into the $330s I‚Äôll hold into next week. Ugh.
I'm conflicted. I held $AMD and since last year the pattern is moon after $INTC ER, dip after own ER (even if it moons before next open) then back to mooning after 2~3 days. I'm tempted to just wait until ER and see what happens. If there's a pullback I'm going all in.

It‚Äôs an organization for physician led care for better patient outcomes. 

Midlevels do not increase access, improve outcomes, or make healthcare cheaper for patients. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous the insane costs they‚Äôre putting on patients with unnecessary imaging, labs, and consults.
You might want to do a little research there buddy. They are extensively trained in medicine.

Pretty much. Domino effect dips get bought up pretty instantly. And this dip happened in AH anyway.
Exactly, I‚Äôm looking at this completely apolitically  by the way. Way too many people would take a bullet for this man, of course they‚Äôll dump their savings on the dude. Honestly I won‚Äôt be surprised if this shit gets to like a $30 billion market cap before ever even signing a deal.
thats the thing, we all know trump is a con artist lol

it might do ok for a bit as trump pumps into the hype, but he wont deliver in the long run, i expect the company to eventually go bust but the stock can easily run for a bit because this market is completely busted
It‚Äôs cause Biden is talking

Every position you attribute to the right is just made up fantasy and is a strawman

The fact that you utter it with complete conviction shows there is no competition of narrative in the media space, you literally dont know what anyone on the right thinks because no one on the right exists in media you watch

Also everyone knows right vs left is alternate realities. The question was is it viable to have a media that caters to right bias? I think so
Let me see what these Intel puts looks like already!

Does the CME website or some other website post charts showing the Contango/Backwardization of Futures? I'm specifically interested in the Bitcoin Futures so that I can make a long/short decision on ticker BITO.
Basically why I bought in near open. Gamestop only has a following because of the stock. There are millions who would die for the guy, why wouldn't they invest in him?

You think Mango Mussolini has orange nut? Or white with a little bit of blood like the rest of us?
Damn, the market bankrupted cashflow so badly it mechanized him into a bot
Do it, put it all on the mango. You know you want too. How are you gonna live with yourself if mango goes to something absurd like $500 or a $1000 a share. You‚Äôre gonna be thinking you should have put your faith in the mango so you could retire early.

You've made far more than most of the morons here. Stick to it.
Who‚Äôs buying 0DTE calls on SNAP tomorrow ? I for sure am
Anyone with no brains at all could have put money into TQQQ last year and made a profit. It's not hard, FAANG/FAGMAN stocks are growing at like 100 percent per year.
Holy shit futs going green maybe my 456C 0 dte aren‚Äôt fucked
Calls ORCL
At least the other days you do believe how stupid you are.
Keep doing what your doing when shit hits the fan u will be better off while most are losing all of their gains
It says that the person made the bet when SNAP was $58.52 which is today AH. It hadn't hit that price for months before this.
couldve easily went the other way and blew your portfolio up

weve seen tickers run up 1000% in a month but at least there were companies behind the names, this particular one doesn't even have a released product yet so its a total gamble

you might win a few gambles here and there but theres no way to consistently win doing that, you'll eventually get screwed and lose it all
Y‚Äôall bulls are salty
You are doing a very good job to have 300 percent profit. I mean if you want to gamble then go ahead. But keep it up üëçüèº
No sh&amp;t, the same happened to me.  Completely missed it until end of the day.  Had to do real work and didn't see any discussion on it plus distracted from TSLA

Turned 100k into 300k this year by playing it safe. no options, no chasing of stocks that have ran more than 10% in past week, always set stop loss. 

Then i look at stocks like orange that runs 700% in a day and I wanna kill myself. I was literally looking it and so close to hitting that buy button while it was $19 and told myself I should stick to what works, fuck.

pretty justified. They have been barely staying afloat by lowering their margins and subsidizing their CPU's

Now with having to spend large amounts of capex to build new foundries, which will almost 100% have yield issues when they first start producing they are going to have to either keep subsidizing and keep their margins low, or increase margins by reducing the subsidy. Not to mention how they literally are NEVER on time with a project and always over budget...

Either way AMD benefits because their EPYC is already better performance-to-cost and they apparently don't have the same issues with margins that Intel has.  And AMD has been executing absolutely perfectly for 14+ quarters in a row with datacenter growth.

Fuck Intel.

Thanks for reminding me, I might watch it tonight.

The ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù don‚Äôt prevent anything tho
For federal contractors, testing is not an option. Even so, companies are not going to allow a testing option as that will eat into margins. 3 companies out of the s&amp;p 500 doesn‚Äôt show that the majority of the companies thought it was a good idea.

You know the FOMO was real when mf's were buying it at 70 bucks at almost the end of AH
Imo I think Oil calls (XOM,USO,XOP, etc.) maybe expiring end of year. Inflation is running rampant and there was a good pullback today. Should give your the return you‚Äôre looking for. Energy crunch should come into picture as the winter comes around.

You would have turned 300k to 2.1M today if you bought mango stock premarket. Shorters or whoever was selling was selling 40M+ worth of shares in 40 mins. They were selling at bid constantly which pushed the price down from 12.40 to 10.40 for 40mins straight.

not sure why anyone would buy puts on SPY ever, jpows 401k is all in SPY and its his largest holding in his non-reg account

If it somehow managed to repeat today‚Äôs %gain it would be around 350
There are so many community colleges, that would end up costing quite a large sum. It would be cheaper and appeal your voter base the same if you just made every state school free in the country for In-State students. It‚Äôs already subsided partially by the state just cover the remainder.
That‚Äôs some wild logic
Based on my recollection of ü•≠'s past, non-real estate ventures, I think I know exactly what to do with MangoSocial after it goes more parabolic and the options chain opens up

Naw, i jumped in but now im a hypocrite in my roommates eyes
Inverse logic on SPY is how you make money after trading for years. Been fucked too many times buying puts near ATH

I hope the after hours trading isn‚Äôt predictive of what will happen tomorrow.
i like the new rules the fed put in place to prevent corruption, its very honest and cool

Gonna but more MAGA tomorrow. Hopefully we have a few days before MAGUH
I feel ya. Made $120 then lost $300. I think I‚Äôm on the right track.
&gt; You're a fucking idiot.
Sometimes you can start as a low level dealer and you start meeting people up the supply chain. Once you build up some trust the people further up will start offering up other opportunities including transport. You set up some guarantees and fly out to California, Colorado, etc. Sometimes you will have to drive but trains are usually a safer bet. You complete a few solid runs and you can sometimes move up to become more of a decision maker. At the end of the day, you just have to play the drug game for a bit and it‚Äôs usually one of the steps on the the way up if you don‚Äôt end up locked up.
How can I turn $50k to $300k to pay of student loans?
Yes, but they're sold out. They're selling for marked up prices on ebay
will DWAyne the roCk johnson get options any time soon?
That is true but these wide sweeping mandates were not issued until the Biden eo which makes me think that the companies thought it was bad policy to institute these mandates
Snaps definitely going to recover some tomorrow as long as market is green or flat eh?
Hmm decisions decisions. Should I go for mango shares or warrants ?
Mango goes to $500 tomorrow and $5000 next week.
There is no product.  Very bullish
Hold the ü•≠ nurture the ü•≠ then bang the ü•≠
Yields flat but stonks down AH.  It is rare but never good when both bonds and stonks go down.  We need to break ATH in stonks or market going to start pricing in inflation.
Ahhh!  It maybe a dictionary.
im sorry fam, but we disagree on GME.

but we agree on ü•≠ so thats good.
My gut tells me MAGA retard stock gonna be mega retarded tomorrow and over the weekend... my predictions are triple digits by Monday

All the amc apes talking about 10,000 a share were right.  They just had the wrong stock.
yeah there are plenty of TV shows that teach you

Breaking Bad, Narcos, etc.
I mean the mango stock will likely keep mooning for a while. There‚Äôs no way the product is anything less than a complete shit show though.
We buying more MAGA tomorrow or what? I was out of BP today
I wish you luck, but that‚Äôs a really lousy idea.

Is that whales I see outside of the Mango Grove?
You gotta start with something like a cucumber 

Now, this is very important: *warm up* the KY before you spread it on the cucumber, *then* put the cucumber in your butt. You‚Äôre trying to get the muscles used to being in that position so leave it for a few minutes at a time then let them relax

From there, graduate to slightly larger fruits and veggies each time you feel ready and pretty soon you have a good pocket going in your butt üëç

I am as well.  I just closed my short leg on my spread on Tuesday.  Should be able to ride my calls through earnings and drug approval.

If it gets a pop above $90, I‚Äôll trim heavily, but I imagine that won‚Äôt happen that quickly.
I still prefer the 84 version more
So edgy
Thinking man right here. FB beats earnings and you'll see a spike.... Now it's the buy the rumor ( puts), sell the news (calls).
DWACW is the play tomorrow, with close end of day.

Watching ad business &gt;&gt; SNAP, FB, TTD and ROKU
There is no nice and not nice, no good and evil.  There's only strong and weak...I learned that from Sensei Kreese in Kobra Kai.

Going to return this thesaurus I bought today. Not only is it terrible, but it's terrible.
Kinda amazing.  Mango is going nuts tomorrow
Dropping last 3k on the retarded MAGA stock tmrw cause fuck it retards gonna be retarded
It looks like tomorrow‚Äôs going to determine if we lose momentum and risk a double top. If so, smoothest bag transfer ever.  From correction to near ATH in 7 sessions‚Ä¶üêª gaped for sure!
It will probably go up or down and to the right. For a more serious answer, the dip was a ripple effect by Snapchat's earnings where they blamed Apple for hindering their ad business but since Amazon and many other tech companies who dont rely on ads will probably bounce back tomorrow.
Damn you Jimmys Johns

We will see lol, could be a great bet. Or you could be a clown.
I‚Äôm surprised Merck doesn‚Äôt get more attention on here
Is there actually going to be options?
If TSLA gives free FSD to employees, it's probably not that good
You can always just quit.  They‚Äôre not making a decision for you, they‚Äôre just covering their asses.  Much easier to make a blanket policy.

Is this a ploy
yes. anyone selling AH based on an earnings report is likely to be an algo or a smart money institutional investor who actually listened to the call or read the report. Anyone buying at open is likely to be a retard TSLA ape gambling on 0 DTE calls and MMs forced to hedge
Margin call on the horizon. Tits up buddy
Yah
At some point the financial press will freak out about the Turkish lira. I'm guessing once the exchange rate passes 10. The world is ripe for a contagion scare.
Oh
Pretty much just a con man
It's not supposed too?
The average age of death from covid is higher than the average age of death. The death rate is roughly equal to a bad flu(it's hard to know fully because the way they counted deaths was whack). Also the average comorbidity for people who died of covid was roughly 3(that means you are at very high risk and not healthy)  

Natural immunity has been shown to be 27 times more effective than the vaccine. 

They are firing people with natural immunity that also work from home. 

The mandates are fully regarded and nonsensical politically theatre

People like you who know nothing and spout off are hilarious but scary, because you are convinced you're right. Youre like the C student who thinks he got an A on the final.

I can only speak for the largest entertainment companies. Not sure about other sectors of the economy.
Most of Tesla trading is short term call option buying, it‚Äôs MMs positioning the ridiculous call buying.
Yep. I went to a QAnon site, a LOT of them are trying to figure out what "settled" means and want to know why they're being censored from buying it. 

Next week will be wild, but a LOT of bag holders are being born right in front of our eyes.
Red Pills vs Blue Pills. Think of it as you would The Matrix.
If they're far out, you're fine.

as a permabull I really hope we get another juicy crash

They might get a notification of a companies stance but no company I know of is forcing workers to prove their vaccination status. As long as you‚Äôre WFH no one gives a fuck what you‚Äôre doing.

I had this thought earlier today when trying to decide on whether or not to make a risky trade.

Now the caveat to that is I‚Äôve never lost everything in a bad trade.

The only reason retards think all media is biased towards the left is because they live in fairy tale world. You think every media company across the entire world is biased left? Lmao, that's only cause you believe in conspiracy theory bullshit.

Possibly bigger. The largest percentage move ever was Volkswagen during its squeeze.

I think this has a chance to beat that.... tomorrow.
Watch everything open down 3% tomorrow then the media could blame ü•≠ ipo
Ok sure, profit is profit. But the opposers watching from the sidelines are about to rip all their hair out watching this.

I‚Äôm in since I‚Äôm 1/0 and can finally get some hard earned flair
People who support him will just hold forever. Getting over GME's $480 is possible
I'll try it now, thank you. I still believe there's something off with the flair prompt itself, though. I'll remove now per your advice. 

P.s. can you flair me literally anything if it does work?

Don‚Äôt forget my comment got TTCF correct now tilray is next to get a nice boost up
What should I do about Coco Vita? Debuted today to a 7% loss. Do I wait out the stock a little and invest then or should invest now expecting a rebound soon?

People still confused what mango is + Boomers always late + Insane ah fomo + Friday payday + Tomorrow morning news cycle + Circuit breaker hype + Cramer probably passes + Reverse psychology thinking tomorrow is red, since today is green, so tomorrow will obviously be green = $300 by close.
Going to stop over trading and trust my plays from now on‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll chalk it up to market tuition I guess
Yeah it‚Äôs an insane long term value tbh
You should be able to say !flairstats again and it'll wipe your flair. Does it? You can adjust your "first seen in WSB" date. lmk if you want to know how to do that.

That‚Äôs the key ain‚Äôt it? The PAST 10 years have been great but what about the next 10 years? When tech got buttfucked in 2000 the Nasdaq was down almost 80% from its highs.

I support it but could we also have flairs for the sole purpose of publicly shaming people who lost their ban bets

Is red redemption 2 a good buy at 40$?
In between 1-2 weeks I believe. It took at least a week to get to this price, so ü•≠ is pumping way harder. I wouldn‚Äôt compare timelines and make guesses off of it.
Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me , that ticker is the only door DWCA has of putting politics into wsb
Too much pride
For Halloween I wanna dress up as DWACULA
I like it. Mine would hopefully be brown.

it's kinda creepy at this point
This is easy. Get two cheeseburgers. Take the tops off. Put a chicken ring on top of one of them. Apply honey mustard. Put other slider on top. For extra credit top with clam strips.

People here don't know how SPACs work. We're seeing the DA announcement runup. It will fall back closer to NAV until right before the merger. LCID(cciv) had a run like this right after the announcement and held for longer than expected, but eventually fell closer to NAV and didn't come back near the highs.

I got banned for making 700% gains today and trying to share it with you
Were info so quick? Is that English? Look take this as a lesson that you were smart enough to not buy into the pump before the dump.
It's inaccurate. I've been on this sub for ~2y. Although I can't remember when I first became 'active', the 1yr badge and 9mo flair are just wrong. I'd rather be flailed 'pigeon' or something meaningless than carry this on my username. Can you please put anything else there or just simply remove it?

Idk but i bought some LOL!
Gamble on what? D-whack?

You have to be trolling. Just look at your grocery list, everything is more expensive. Look at gas prices and real estate. There are jobs galore, particularly low skilled labor. There are patty flippers making $15 an hour some places now.

I'm glad for the people who caught the Mango pump but there's zero future potential for that shit. Who the fuck is gonna use it? 30% of retards who want to spread conspiracy theories unchecked? It's literally Parler 2.0 and do you know anyone who made it past high school who uses Parler? Get the fuck outta that garbage before it dumps and live richly off your gains.
Damn. A lot of haters in here. Either sold too early or didn‚Äôt get on the ride at all‚Ä¶This is WSB. Why wouldn‚Äôt you gamble on this???
The S&amp;P 500 has been up 7 straight days. It hit both a new intraday and closing record today.

Aye!
Supply is even worse
What in the bloody fuck is a warrant?
i bought some SNAP after hours and sold 30 min later after it recovered a bit
We've seen this show before. It's more likely that the commons come down than it is that the warrants go up. But my crystal ball is defective AF and nothing makes sense when it comes to the former guy.

Yeah it‚Äôs related to spacs. You should look up info about them because I‚Äôm not going to be able to explain it as well as others but right now I‚Äôm treating them like regular shares
remember that scene where Danny runs into those twins with his tricycle.. that's TWTR tomorrow.
Me too, I was gonna buy $10,000 worth but SPACs have been shit for so long I only did $5000.

No no no. SNAP took care of that already.

Heard hunter biden bought ü•≠ warrants at $.50 yesterday.
Fomo'd into some of DonaldsWetAssCunt. We'll see what happens
If each warrant can be exercised for one share of ü•≠ at 11.50, then the price of the warrant is meant to include the premium between the exercise price and the current price of a ü•≠. Which means the warrants are like 30 dollars undervalued compared to ü•≠?
I have no idea how inflation can be up.

Didn‚Äôt receive a single cent of stimulus. Housing market is terrible. Condos are 20% below 2008 prices. Employers are cutting jobs or slashing wages. The few that aren‚Äôt are giving out 0% raises.

Ripster called this one out from the 30s and it has printed, rebounded nicely the past few weeks. Good fundamentals

We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

‚ÄúLooking at it another way, Renaissance Capital‚Äôs Kennedy notes that based on his data, 70% of SPAC IPOs so far this year are trading below their $10 offer price (that‚Äôs through September 15, and includes those that have announced and a few that have completed mergers). And of the SPACs that have completed mergers in 2021, 58% trade below their original offer price, according to Renaissance data.‚Äù

Random story that will get buried, but my first ever stock years ago, was the free one I received with Robinhood, when I still used them.

It was (APPS) Digital Turbine 
Around $5.

Ad agency for IOS apps (or something of the sorts)

I‚Äôve bought into them ever since, and It‚Äôs now almost $90. It has great company numbers for those who want to do some research and find something new.

*just a redneck who messed around with sports betting and stocks, not a financial pro
Don't buy it then
Very interesting, and looks like good news for Wework as well. It very well could be low risk with high reward. He already owns enough media companies to supply it with loads of content. Even though it looks like it won‚Äôt be his hands on the wheels

Do you have to sign up for AH trading or you just go to sell after hours like normal?
You just pick and choose? What‚Äôs the point if you don‚Äôt list the ban bet I was egged on to do it ffs and you don‚Äôt list it? Wack as fuck
Don't be mad because you missed on opportunity, enjoy it with the rest and move on

This is bullshit I placed a ban bet for $70 and they didn‚Äôt list it wtf mods.

Me neither. They opened up a location thats supposed to be the biggest in the country less than a mile from me
Easy in, easy out is how everyone is suggesting you play with this ticker. Only one holding the bags will be people hoping in too late.
That SAM yolo post made a lot of sense. Too bad it got fukd
Yeah
no one except Pelosi
I know the moment I buy mango stock it‚Äôs gonna dump so y‚Äôall have fun
At least you got grifted by the best
Im smoking mango juice vape
For everyone having FOMO about mango, keep in mind that the VWAP for this is still somewhere in the low $30s. I still think this thing can go to $5-10B valuation minimum on hype/fomo alone, but there will definitely be profit taking when the market opens (it did another 50% move on 5% of the daily volume). Also as long ownership settles with brokers, more shorts will be available. The only thing worse than buying a mango stock is bagholding one. Hope that puts your hearts at ease.
Really regret not buying mango stonk üò¢ could‚Äôve tripled

This is snapchat. Not a sector wide problem.... At the end of the day, tech is still where money will go.. What do you want to invest in? Fubo?? Small caps? Trumps pump and dump?
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
A ton of brokers let you buy AH. Just not Robinhood

Imagine a subway, but instead you get your own personal compartment, and it makes stops at specific destinations instead of every station. 

Then imagine that you have to hail this compartment with your phone and it‚Äôs still driven by a human.

Then recognize that there are only 700 compartments which worst case scenario are used even less efficiently and only have 1 passenger each.

I can totally picture a timeline where I say "in before 70" and come out the other end a millionaire
GME doesn't have a benefactor behind it who likes to suck all the value out of everything he touches after people have dumped their money into it, though. At least not like this one does. LOL

I totally see what you're saying, though. Who knows how long it's going to run for.
THANK YOU PRESIDENT PUMP
And this means what exactly? Fb is not snapchat son. Never have been.

SNAP is going to put me in a hole tomorrow. Never doing earnings again.
You better give him so many rimjobs, he could afford 10 of you by now if he would have got in at 18.

No lean hogs den
Fuckin RIP

LOL yeah, he can do better
I wonder if they will turn off the buy button tomorrow lmao
I'm buying puts on fb and Twitter because if snap can be clapped by Apple all social media can
Shits going to close at 69.69
I‚Äôm feeling frisky, maybe I‚Äôll go check out that new White Castle next to the house ü§î
I agree that‚Äôs endgame but don‚Äôt underestimate how long the pump can go - look at GMe
What u mean? Lol
Same revenue models
Add a ü•≠ to the ticker
Oh I guarantee there are people on here who think it's a hold... and there are probably a large number who aren't going to time the exit right even if they know it's a pump and dump.
what should we teach 7 year olds, critical race theory or how to buy spacs
Donald Pump in the house
I don‚Äôt even want to live right now
Just Google his name + spac I think mods aren‚Äôt happy with people posting the ticker
Must not fomo... Must not fomo... Must not fomo... Must not fomo...
I convinced my bf not to buy ü•≠ at $18 cause it was too risky and did the same when he wanted to buy again at $44. We‚Äôre not talking now

And, with FB's woes, too, I can see a lot of those dollars going to Google instead. Google should moon after ER on its own numbers. I'm buying more calls 5-6 months out.
Don‚Äôt forget trailing stop losses
Algos gonna do what algos gonna do
Nah - go on Parler I dare you‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just kkk crap.  When it first launched it was a common thing to see people complaining about FB and saying they tried to get their friends and family to move to Parler but no one would, so they couldn‚Äôt delete their FB.  People don‚Äôt maintain both, and even the most racist grannies want to see the pics of their grandkids.  People will join this but there won‚Äôt be active engagement
I can‚Äôt believe your eyes either. I don‚Äôt see that with my eyes.
Add a W to the ticker
And it probably will with all the media attention it will get tonight
are we going cash gang tmrw or do you think the market will shoot up within the first 30 minutes

Everyone is saying it's a pump and dump. No one is planning to hold this for 2 months, let alone the whole 2 weeks.
Dude it‚Äôs not even launched yet. Chill

If it had options I would buy the 100 strike daily.

Snap bringing down QQQ is so fucking weird.
It's not googl so this is sus AF
AMD owns them
What‚Äôs really crazy is if I would have held onto my baba and MRNA calls I would have been 250k richer right now
I mean, isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs bad for SNAP good for other social media? All that advertisements didn‚Äôt just ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù they just moved to other platforms
People saying no crash because everyone is expecting a crash but VIX at lowest level since before the pandemic üëª
Today SPY was somewhat ugly most of the day and QQQ was up. I‚Äôm fine with the opposite tomorrow lol.
We have other places to go, lol

Whatever seems logical, do the opposite‚Ä¶
Donald hit 80. Can't believe my eyes.
Orange is the new GREEN
His press release literally mentioned he‚Äôs working on both ventures. Social media and traditional news media. 

Hate him, I get it, but at least read past the headline.
tbh at a certain price point retail cant help pump it anymore so we'll see what happens
whats the move tomorrow?
I'm going to cut his dick off and boil it in hog fat
Meanwhile, tilray pops and drops
This is why I doubt he signs the deal, he'll just find someone to give him more money up front.
SNAP just fumbled the ball in the 4th quarter. I think the 2020 October W pattern just initiated. SPY 500 EOY just a little detour
If mods ran a bot and banned everyone with a mango mention it would be like Thanos snapping his fingers and half of everyone disappearing.
Yes. It will

No, Trump Co stock became worthless and was delisted many years ago. This new venture will end the same way.

#MY MOVE IS MOVING EVERYTHING FROM FB AND TWTR TO TRUTH
I require validation that tesla will drop back down to the 850's by next week. 


Please. 



Anyone?
He didn‚Äôt just talk about it, he offered them a billion dollars to start working on a COVID vaccine. And then they had to give it back.
Has mainstream news ever questioned Nancy about her options plays? If so do you have a link? Please share
Just a MASSIVE rug pull after hours 

A lot of people thought SNAP would deliver meaning juggernauts like GOOG and FB would also deliver‚Ä¶..

Look how they loaded up with both hands into GOOG right before close and SPY/QQQ 

Tomorrow will be ugly ü•∞üß∏
walter bloomberg fucking failed me. where was the mango notif? i, nor many others on this sub did not know about dee wack until it was up 100%
i'm sure others will pump it for him though. I bet this thing does another 300%+ tomorrow.
bought some otm november calls today. looking like it was the correct choice
Wake up early for pre market it may go ham. How I maxed my game shop returns in round 1. Pre market pump was joocy
Nobody is selling mangos for a long time
Hey those are fair points. A few months and you‚Äôre done. Good luck!

I don't care who you voted for in 2020, this is mango money we're talking about.
To think he could have started his own news network and take Fox News out of business. But no. What irked him was that Dorsey and Zuckerberg both banned him from social media and he couldn‚Äôt tweet anymore. So he‚Äôs now starting a social media company ü§£
Glad I sold half my snap calls today but imma lose a cool 1k on this drama

sold some TTWO 185c for a nickel

next day they're at 1.65 cause 5% jump. 3200% increase. but I don't care. go ahead and hit 185 tomorrow and then cash me out, been holding this shit like 5k in the red for a year now, I'll take 3k profit and walk away
I think it‚Äôs gonna be locally hosted. Cause they also want to compete with AWS
well you‚Äôre obviously autistic, and they‚Äôre rolling out DNR orders for mentally handicapped COVID patients so i‚Äôd say get the triple vax
A lot of green insurrections today
I do.  Bought it pre market and bought throughout the day.  Love it!
To be clear I‚Äôm happy for everyone who will profit I didn‚Äôt hear about it till after hours. I don‚Äôt like the guy but I don‚Äôt much care for all the tech companies I profit on anyways.
no options no buyüò§
His app isn't even ready.  And it's valuation is $1.7B at $10.
It hasn‚Äôt stopped running yet. One of them has gained almost another 100% AH. It runs another couple days at least. A lot of people missed it today. I bought at 9 sold at 11.50. Then went back in at 13 against my better judgement and I am going to hold until I see it fall substantially.
Gamma squeezes are a real this thing too. If an options chain came out on this it would go ballistic for a few weeks.
jumped in end of day, already double
Same in Boston, it‚Äôs great for the community. and people still talk bad about them
Why not tho
Trump Co has a market value somewhere around $10 billion (if it were post-merger today with all extra share thresholds reached)... not sure I have ever seen anything like this.

This is like BYND or TLRY on steroids; even they took a few weeks to play out to this level... this all happened in 1 trading day.
Ok Kyrie Irving.
Remember when GME was at $30 and AMC was at $10 and you said to yourself ‚ÄúWell, no point going in now‚Äù.
legacy media is dying.  Trump gave them huge rating while he was in office, effectively keeping em on life support.  Now he is gone CNN FOX MSNBC are back to 2015 levels of viewership and will now continue the scheduled decline.
Na damage done. It will trade flat
Depends where u bought.
Want some more gasoline with that take?

Good lord.
I have no calls on AMD, but over 7k worth of stock
Nah dude, not with all the money flowing to the Donald pump stock
LOL
RIP Intel boomers
It's too bad Trump got his ass banned cuz he can totes pump it bigly right now on Twitter

Everyone knows what will eventually happen but in the mean time it's pump pump pump.
Damn. Rip mate. Bite the bullet then to stay home and keep saving. No shame in that
So one iphone change killing everybody's company now? 

Picking up some Google tomorrow. Chicks still love YouTube
Parler fell apart because it too was deplatformed and removed from all app stores, not because it had a bad business model.
Gonna üí© verbal gold for the next couple years. 

Although very possibly profitable I‚Äôll be on the sidelines for this one
Got warrnts at $6
Right!
Saw this on Twitter.  Could go with another spac.  Maybe that one would have options lol

Noting that I don't see definitive documents filed.  And...we're talking about a counterparty who has one of the most self-centered views of fairness history has ever known.  Just be careful of the risk Trump re-trades this deal and thanks $DeWAC for the price discovery
Guidance probably lowered
Yeah without an options chain I‚Äôm not sure how hard this can really pump from here
AMC :(
that new social site will be dropped asap from whoever decides to host it ü§£ü§£ü§£

The SEC just released that GME and AMC were NOT short squeezes, they were just retail investors. This Donnie stock could ACTUALLY be the first short squeeze. I could see it getting to like $100 - $200 in the future, liberals getting mad and shorting it, then his followers going fuckin crazy squeezin it
I do kind of want this to be my biggest play of all time...
Kicking myself right now for not taking it seriously.

I am rock hard
I've been rotating calls all week and almost sat this one out since I try to avoid playing expiry dates these days, but bought 2 119/121 call debit spreads just before close because I felt optimistic and wanted to do a little gamble LOL. Woot! It's not much but it's almost certainly gonna be gains!

I never should have dismissed the market powers of DONALD PUMP when I saw what was happening in the $40 range today. F

I‚Äôm actually confident in it. If they do it right it can be extremely profitable. Especially an AWS competitor.
Don't forget the University! üòÑüòÑ

Don‚Äôt Fomo, don‚Äôt fomo. Don‚Äôt Fomo. Oh well. Here we go
the whole reason trump ran in 2016 was to promote his own news network after losing.  He never expected to actually win the fuckn thing.

So this has been in the making for 6 years.

Also, being kicked off twitter is just a little side hustle now.  He will have his news network to compete with FOXnews with a smaller social media app to slightly compete against twitter.
Yoooo there is good money there. Trump is very good at monetizing
Gonna be some epic ü•≠ loss porn when this thing inevitably dumps

I'm leaving politics out of this and staying vague because it's easier than argiing with team red and team blue (I'm not even American so IDGAF)

Pro: It promises to eliminate censorship and promotes free speech. 

Con: No censorship means it won't be advertiser friendly and will attract trolls meaning it won't be a great place to visit and the userbase will be small (see Voat for an example of how this will play out).
I'm sorry but I'm selling half these "shares" at the crack of dawn.
He shoudlve jusr SPAC‚Äôd
Just like the Patriot Act or War on Drugs
Burry and Cathie both go long on Trump media, stock market implodes.
They are few and far in between, friend.

Again, wrong sub. You're just circlejerking your own perceived intellectual superiority when you can simply just go google up the business plan yourself.
It really is all about the dividends. INTC is basically a retirement plan stock, or a risk anchor stock. (though obviously that's not working during earnings lately LOL)
Get vaxxed lmfao I‚Äôm in the opposite position I wanna get vaxxed but can‚Äôt cuz then I‚Äôll have to move out
For good reason
just get the vax bruh, you will instantly regret not getting it once you get kicked out.

SPY 500 eoy btw
Couldn‚Äôt care less, these monkeys would push this shit so hard if there was an options chain. shOrT sQuezE
Half of Facebook's 2.8 billion users? You a retar d?
Make Stonks great again
GME is way overvalued, but at least they have revenue. This is just some SPAC with ü•≠ claiming he‚Äôs gonna make a competitor to Facebook. It‚Äôs just a pump and dump bullshit scam.
I mean it was low 50‚Äôs December of last year. So basically a year.
I‚Äôm gonna join this retard next week with my ban. Same bet
First they'd have to figure out how to turn on a computer.
bought at 13.43 sold at 25.76 , bought at 42.50 , waiting.
Can someone tell me when is SPCE lock-up expiry??
Nah, might dump some more at open since SNAP announced after close today, I would like to get in under $2700.
Got in at 18.88
Seriously though, that‚Äôs what happened.
Treason to what?
Tell your parents to fuck off, but don't say it until you have somewhere else to live.
I never thought my first 3 bagger would be a stock and not options
Yup the float is so low it could easily hit 150
Solid.
There are lots of very intelligent people here with a wide diversity of opinions. That‚Äôs invaluable
you know the SEC talks about us by name at this point in print and on the MSM, can you let us stick to our guns while letting you get away with emoji stuff? I don't want to block your fun, I just want to protect the fort.
Just get vaxxed. Be protected. 

Your parents care enough about you to do it.  Im living with a roommate and i was almost kicked out if i didn't get the shot. 

Stay with your parents, make bank on market buy house. Get vaxxed
Get the vaccine and stop being retarded, or if you want to keep being retarded, pay for the shoebox

Life exists outside the bubble, comrade.

Money is money.
Think about all the rabid Trump fans and wanting a 2024 re-elect, probably immediately monetized too‚Ä¶
kind of like bagholding pltr but a little classier
The discount is gonna be there always for warrants anyways.
Tech getting rekt after hours. SoFi drops 2%. Rip.
Doesn't even have a signed deal yet...
then you know the fact that it's "higher than twitter" means literally nothing
Wtf?
So my üß† isn‚Äôt as big as I thought
$2k/mo for rent sounds super expensive and you have like 0.2% of dying getting the vax.
Fuqq your parents niqqa. Authoritarian cultists. Just get a fake vaxx certificate. Plenty of them to be acquired.

How‚Äôs is this even a question?
its mostly competing with FOXnews which is down like 60% over 18 months.
11.50 but I paper handed early
He is the only reason the media still makes money by constant stories about him, endless coverage. His presidency boosted their profits probably more than anyone else in history, so that‚Äôs one
this is a pure gamble play. personally i'd get another shot for the money. can you deal with having an extra arm, or maybe 1 working lung ? yes . you can. if you die? big deal, can't use money anyway.
Agreed. This is the $30 GME point
But the Steaks are good, right?
Buy the $INTC dip? Don't mind if I do.
Just move out and enjoy life. Living with parents sucks regardless
Does mango have an options chain available on it yet?
Yes that's exactly what's happening

Still low next to companies that exist, yes.

Mango media warrants printing lmaooo
It‚Äôs just another scam. See: trump airlines, steaks, casino, etc. I‚Äôll eat a ghost chili raw if the platform is released and endures for more than 3 months.
Healthier than starving to death.
It's gonna be very big, the biggliest, smartest social media platform. Very smart.
**Someone's selling 10 to 20 million shares of AAPL every day, you can see the block trades like clock work between 12 and 1:30 pm.

Tell your parents to stop being Lib cucks.  Then buy a ton of DWAC and get ready to own a room in the nearest Trump Tower.
Yes I know that‚Ä¶
AMC has touched $40b market cap and has consistently held a $20b market cap for like 5 straight months now. At a $1.6b market cap, mango media is just getting started imo
Why play snap calls at those prices?

Parents are liberal af and want me to get double vaxed or else move out. My argument is there is no need to over do it.

Either I get another vax live rent free or moveout and pay $2000+ for rent for a shoe box.

If I moveout I can‚Äôt yolo deep OTM SPY calls.

ehh, if you play it right you can make some quick bucks from those.  gotta find the ones with momentum and just get in/get out quick.  almost always profit from the run-up to news
Yes, trading options on a leveraged fund doesn‚Äôt add more leverage cause IV is inherently higher.
Seriously though. Who has under 18 of orange buy in
You mean Mr. Pelosi?
AMD for the win tomorrow.
It's not going to be a serious platform. It's just more chud gruel. Who SPACs before they have any semblance of a company? Profiteers without a business plan, that's who... and given who we're talking about the fact that that was his grift for like 50 years, it's just one more time to take advantage of people and create a new generation of bagholders. Solidly 90% of the people celebrating on this thread right now in 2 months are going to be posting "If we just all work together, we can get it back up to $6!"
I‚Äôm in amd atm and up quite a lot. I might sell before earnings tho. Lots of retail think AMD is continuing to steal market share but I still think there might be supply chain issues across all semiconductors. Might sell my shares tomorrow.

Has anyone acknowledged yet how fitting the orange face on the WSB logo is after today? We're not talking pumpkins anymore.
There used some to be some BS no SPAC rule. Not sure if it still exists. I‚Äôd say go for it
[deleted]
Still a SPAC. IMO Spacs over $2 bil should be able to be talked about. But nobody asked me.
Wow. Maga stonk is madness. Options are going to blow up sky high
I thought futures would be more volatile than this after the AH tech dip. Looks like they're going to walk the dip back up.
Happens everyday dude
Futures faker than u/cashflow_‚Äôs gains
That's when your confidence is hot, and they probably do. feelings go both ways

Trump demographics are mostly 45+ confused adults who hates facts and science. Might be good for advertisers.

Also the website looks like what it would cost someone 10k-20k to build. You know they overpaid for it.
it depends on whether they beat earnings or not. if they miss they'll go down even further. It doesn't look good for them rn, but unless you have insider knowledge it's really tough to know.  


All the pros were predicting an earnings beat for SNAP, and look what happened. if they can't even predict accurately, how could we hope to?
Is he on truth social yet?

woweee
Nope, Intel's last ever split was before that.
I already made money on that today.  Classic pnd

Cramers head going to look like the Sankara stones after reporting on $DW4C

Splits, dummy
No problem! Good luck! I know that feeling! 

I don't have the capital to play in LEAPS at the moment, but I have changed to doing more rolling options strategies, like doing tighter debit spreads based on resistance points with the intent of rolling them after they gain. It's slower than trying to hit big, but you get more turns at the play and I've seen more consistent gains having a target to get out at, even if it's not going to give the greatest gains.

There are lots of options strats for different risk appetites.

I like the "screenshot rule" ... basically, if it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to sell. I think it kinda works the same way if we think to ask if we should sell on WSB. That means we're nervous about not selling, and that's a sign we might want to take some risk off the table.
You already missed the boat

Well  I am a tard that‚Äôs likes to buy spy puts so wtf do I know‚Ä¶
If SNAP is $120 Billion market cap I guess it‚Äôs plausible that TRUTH goes much higher.  I just doubt the ability to retain users and build a coherent ecosystem.  Parler fell apart quickly, people have too much invested in Facebook at this point and aren‚Äôt leaving for a platform where most people would never associate with.  Even their pitch book says only 1/3 of Americans would use a Trump platform.
LOL. This is the retarded üí© I came to see.
Not sure the time
Low volume movements to all time highs are not good entry points. Tomorrow is gonna be a pullback to high 40s. What a wild day
Market cap is still low in comparison to AMC/GME $40b market caps during the mania phase. I say triple digit stock price is imminent.

Awesome example and explanation, I'll look more into that and try to do this in the future. Always tough when you're in green and trying to make that decision whether to take profits.

Well, it may work a little bit different for LEAPS, but the idea of rolling options in this example is to lock in profit. Let's say a stock is trading at $10 and I buy a $15 call option, then the strike moves up to $20, but I still have time on it... I may not want to lose all possible gains moving forward, but I want to lock in my profit, what I'll do is basically calculate my reposition by looking at which strike/date combination I can buy to give myself the same basic potential for profit as it moves up more. That way if it dumps I don't lose my gains... I highly recommend using an options calculator to figure out which one is the best to roll to in order to  get the best benefit if you're not sure how the Greeks will influence potential gain should it keep moving up.

In this example, I might buy a $20 strike call and sell the original one, which will reduce my risk significantly (at the cost of reducing some of the delta and gamma I might benefit from, depending on the option strike I choose).
I did that and sold months later at 50% loss. Pm me for strategies

After seeing the what happened to SNAP, I‚Äôm hoping if my my 40k in CLF goes south it doesnt dump like that‚Ä¶

I made a ban bet that I would chop my balls off if BB closed above 13 this week and Wednesday made me nervous. I feel chill now üòé

Bought some FB shares AH earlier.  already up 3 points.  Bought a share of GOOGL as well.  planning to flip both tickers.
what are you talking about? are you trying to make this political bitch ? this is about making money. so stfu
In the future you'll be able to buy stocks on actual people, like sports stars or famous people, or people like Bill Gates, Elon Musk or Taylor Swift.

Crazy how much $5 buys you behind Wendy‚Äôs
No news which is why the drop makes no sense. I think here is a crucial turning point. Either we run up or down for a bit. I think up is more likely.
EPS was good. Revenue slightly down. Possibly large investors sold because the stock was running up. Tank it and buy it again maybe?
Oh god I wish
Why we dump so much AH?
They would make you think that was the top. SPY ATH tomorrow boys
Heck yes!!!

AAPL is the reason they nosedived. New data privacy on iPhone blocks 3rd party apps like FB from tracking you and selling info to advertisers
They were okay. This is an overreaction as always. I do think that Apple hindering their ad business can have further repercussions though. Again, an overreaction nonetheless.
Trying to get life advice from my boomer dad is so dumb. Like dude you grew up jerking off to magazines, fought in vietnam, and had a wife, house, and kid by 27. None of ur shit applies to me.

You're now $100 richer, congrats
I genuinely feel badly for people that don‚Äôt believe in BB. To get this stock in the neighborhood of $10 is an absolute fucking steal. It should be 100% of everyone‚Äôs portfolio. Combination of shares and leaps.
‚ÄúThey‚Äù r fuk!!!
Investors don‚Äôt care whether or not they ‚Äúlike‚Äù what apple does. It‚Äôs about whether it not it makes them money.
Apple is having success withholding valuable data to other companies in the name of privacy. In reality, they‚Äôre probably keeping the data for themselves or at the very least, taking away an advantage of their competitors
You know what always happen after a 25% discount.
Can you elaborate on the idea behind rolling up? My call is an ITM leap for June next year, at 92.50, and it's unclear what the advantage is in doing so. Thank you in advance if you have a minute to explain.

Why oh why did I ever go long a Japanese company. The Japanese cannot experience days that are a touch red so it always winds up down &gt;.8 percent. So many traumatized paper handers.

Yeah but it could've just as easily gone to 100

They're going down cause of aapl. If anything aapl goes up from taking capital from those companies

Because investing in someone will a multitude of failed businesses behind them is the only way to make money in the stock market‚Ä¶
A social media platform of people that hype each other and will buy anything to support the cause is the most clear demographic ever to make money on, if you can't see this business model then you don't deserve money
You are fine. No worries.
Will do. Thanks friend
Someone is sad they didn‚Äôt make money today

It's up 400%.. you must not like money, why are you here?
That's some premium, grade A salt getting tossed your way. In ancient times, you'd get paid in salt and wouldn't see that much in a year.
It was a good day for sure. Should‚Äôve got more.
Just think about when they offer the secondary and dilute 500% or something crazy

I'm serious. If the market price is driven by buyers and sellers, then if hedgies dump 20B worth of shares, then the market would need buyers for the other side of the transaction? The buyers are other hedgies?
Really scary shit. Not sure if I should stress rn
Holy shit rip teq

As a point of reference. It is a fact that you can be overtly communist (as far to the left as possible) on all platforms, but anything slightly to the right gets banned. That‚Äôs why I said that if there is free speech for commies, what problem have you got with MAGA twitter?

Idk if you're serious or not? Do you understand the definition of market cap?
Market Cap is just current share price * outstanding shares. If they dump fast enough the supply overrides the demand, causing heavy loss in market cap. They don't dump 20 billions at once necessarily
Where are you checking? It's at 1.702 on marketwatch
So I can buy a bunch of it in the morning

fucking JPOW sold 5 million dollars worth of options on the dow just before it went down, google it.
There go futures lol. Easy circuit breaker. How the FUCK did Snapchat actually just bring the US market to its knees? I don‚Äôt get it‚Ä¶
Well I was being sarcastic. I was basically saying that people will get tired of paying subscription fees for everything at some point.
How do you leverage yourself if you were jacked to the tits on Facebook calls? They expire December, but it‚Äôs about to wipe my portfolio come market open. Double down and buy more calls for 440? Snapchat is gay and only offers gay ass shit. No one cares about it. Facebook actually has something to offer, so I don‚Äôt see this staying down. Hmmmm

If you were a hard core Donnie fan and new to the stock market and bought his stock today plus loaded up on weekly twitter and facebook puts to fuck them over you'd have done better than any professional and anyone on WSB
Snap calls at open? That drop was massive.
üò¨ I know haha thank you friend
Could be a case of snap blaming apple but people putting the pieces together and seeing that it‚Äôs a nascent decline in advertising spend and this is just the canary in the coal mine. Could also be that the snap earnings miss is just giving people an excuse to sell after a good run from the beginning of October.
INTC LMFAO ü§£
Already bought, down
I should‚Äôve mentioned it‚Äôs for 6 people. But American and delta are both $1,200 for 6 people

Snap and FB L
TLRY coming back from the depths of hell I see
ya I'm starting to get serious 1999 vibes from this market. feds and politicians insider trading, tech going up wayyy too much, China in deep shit, I'm out. Gl all of you.
Somebody go out in the woods and tell MAGA about mango stock.  Let‚Äôs pump this shit
They love their anti-elite message‚Ä¶no better way to stick it to the man than by making him rich.
Is there options on mango ü•≠ man stick, I wanna buy puts.
As much as i hate the guy, yes.. i feel a shift coming
When I saw it mentioned on my ig feed this morning I was like YEEEAAAH and then....

&amp;#x200B;

And then I saw the whole thing about mango and I immediately checked my bank to see how much I could afford to lose for my $100+ yolo target, deposited it and went balls deep
I told you guys Brian Laundry was gator üêä bait‚Ä¶. Where‚Äôs my award?
Today I found out a woman's breath stinks after she swallows. Feeling bullish

Nope I bought 45 DTE puts and got blown up.
Is there any way simpletons could have known about this even early this morning?  ...with 10 spac nav it was super low risk, could have easily put whole 401k on it for a day.
It's like you've never banked 150% in a day on one stock
Stick
To the rules man one trade cannot exceed one weeks pay
When I started trading I would do so much analysis of my purchases that it was insane. 

After the whole GME and meme stock craziness I've converted into picking a direction on random stocks and buying FDs like a roulette wheel. 

I'm not doing as well as I used to. But I'd be lying if I said I don't enjoy this version of stocks way more. 

Come on baby! WeWork, I know you have a history of being shady AF, but I just bought calls today so let it ride!! Pick a direction and run for daddy!
I‚Äôm inclined to believe that dozens of millions of MAGA boomers will catch up on the news over the weekend, dump MSM platforms and pump MAGA stock to the moon.
Sounds like your looking at prime select seats tickets.where the hell u flying out of
oof that snap miss hurt. No more trading for me. My port does great when i don't touch it, so I think i'm going back to that.

Always remember, you're playing against ppl that are cheating. THere was a lot of insider selling before this miss, dunno why i didn't take that more seriously.

3. Read the news about Biden and his trillion+ bills

4. Sleep stress free with bank earnings/more when Biden drops the bills tn or tomorrow

5. Sell calls at $460+ tomorrow and send lambo dealer
They walk, bike, moped, or take public transit much more than the US?
I have to admit.  That‚Äôs a good one.

You know.. the more I look at the chart. The more I'm starting to think that those Intel calls I bought today for earnings might not pan out how I thought.
I think separation of church and state will prevent that from happening.
Hmmmm is there any new platforms coming out?

Funny how all social media stonks tank the day trumps social media stock goes public
For the Halloween season, a theory: I feel Zuck is basically Dr. Frankenstein at this point. He looks at his creation and feels disgust and shame. Hence the name change, the metaverse talk, etc. He knows he can't destroy it, it is out of his control. So time to create something new.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking at too - are you kidding me? It could be 10x that easily
Isn't it ironic, don't ya think.

The post-covid rally started when SNAP gapped up 30+% from earnings in April 2020.
Depends on what income level the bar is
Owned it for the yield a long time ago and bought calls back in the Covid crash, cashed that shit out yesterday for 1500%
Bro don‚Äôt tease me I‚Äôm already so hard it hurts
I said you're not in reality.

Which was apparently correct, since you somehow interpreted in an accusation from me I didn't make.
Like that would be a bad thing. Some ppl really have no business being on social media. My 82 yr old mom who accidentally went live while her nurses aid gave her a bath is a good example of one.

Parlor?  I think its called.

Trump never went to that or promoted it.

Him starting a new thing, with a large tech firm backing.  Is much different.

Also, this has been in the works since 2016.  I think the only reason he ran to begin with was to promote his new news network.  Not expecting to actually win the presidency.

This is his network to compete against FOX originally.  Now its expanded to be in compitition with Twitter as well.
Um, buddy? You're calling Trump/Republican supporters cult members without knowing anything about them, while lecturing me about strangers and about not knowing anything about you. You also don't know much about Trump -- a stranger to you -- seeing as to how you ignored all his successful businesses.

That is called projection, yes. In fact, that's ironically a cultish thing to do.
IBM $140 1/21/22 CALLS were trading at $6.30 yesterday, $8 last week.

Is it people buying options for the next day or what?
I'm not a bear, but when I get puts and the target drops, it feels sooooo good...
Its the junk in the trunk for me
Yes I do think you can make some money, but at these prices, hedge funds will salivate to short it.

What is it exactly that I‚Äôm projecting according to you, internet stranger? His financial failures are well documented. You have no knowledge about me. Maybe you should be less presumptive‚Ä¶
I agree it‚Äôs coming, but the theme of this rally was solid earnings and we are having that. If next week google fb etc earnings are shitty, then we get the pullback, just my 2 cents.
More like 3 months
Tomorrow Nasdaq opens down -7%.
they have public transit that alleviates the need to drive literally everywhere.
Remember what happened to "I forgot their name twitter competitor" after Trump and his goons flocked to it to talk about election lies and tAkINg BaCk tHe CoUnTry.  They couldn't find a web host that was willing to be liable.  How will this time be any different?  He's spreading the same insurrection garbage baby tantrum that he has been since 2020.

This is like another TMC.
cool now they ar equlaualy valyooed
PINS ER calls
No it hasn't
What's probably going to end up happening is that QQQ and TQQQ are going to be slightly low at the open and that's going to generate buying, which'll push AMD et al up even further... AMD's flying AH. This isn't a total tech sell-off.
The fuck happened to snap after hours? Is it because i deleted my account today?
Is holding an already 12.5 banger F call through earnings greedy?
i don‚Äôt even have enough to give to the money bank
True but until then its coke and hookers
I don‚Äôt wanna tout BB in here anymore because there are so many doubters. They deserve to miss out on the mega moon that will occur here before year-end‚Ä¶..
So have we found the best meme? The greatest meme even of all time?
Doesn't matter what snap does if the whole market wants to bet against Brandon ;)
So what the fuck was that SOFI spike at 5:10

So what? SPY is a tech etf, it doesn‚Äôt revolve *entirely* around what Biden says or economic catalysts. Some days it just goes down when it seems like it should be going up based on economic factors. Some days shit is happening that you would think would drag it down and it explodes anyway. It‚Äôs dropped almost a dollar so far after hours. It would be cool if that passed tomorrow but even if it does that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean SPY will explode. Hopefully they do pass it and SPY gets a pump but you were saying this same exact stuff last week, ‚Äúit‚Äôs definitely gonna pass on Friday and save my calls‚Äù
I yolo‚Äôd into spy 452.50 puts 10/22 just before close. Trying not to get my hopes up. Expecting this to be bought up in the AM. But I may be the wallstreet genius
Yes because volume is insane, and hedge funds have gotten smart and learned not to fight big volume (see CLOV/SDC and the rest).

They know how to bring these things back to rationality.
Mango phones
I know this is WSB , but I'm playing it safe in this market. Bought Jan 22 calls on CVS and HBI. Actually did my research for once and both companies are undervalued with decent upside.
The Stalinist moron?
Because contracts don‚Äôt trade AH.
god damn i hope you're right lol i've got some nice AMD calls and INTC puts
The market is on some hard ass drugs man next year gonna be ugly

No biggie.
SNAP don't you touch my baby APPS dirty
I mean, your either right or wrong.  I'm in $9.5k, are you in or just mad you missed?
BREAKING NEWS: SNAP is closing its business.
1.5 B market cap is joke, upside is there big time.
I made a bet about snap going to 80 after earnings see y‚Äôall in a week
Not exactly defenders. They just want the data for themselves and prevent their competitors from accessing it
Idk if u watch American news or not but this thing is coming faster than u think
With the really down market at open, it'll be hard but I wish you luck. Probs will be closer to 905 if we're being hopeful
Lol I'd be fine with that
How much does a good prostitute go for these days? Asking for a friend.
My FB calls are too.  "Oh there goes $100k in 1 second because SNAP missed revenue but doubled earnings estimate".  Market makes perfect sense.
I‚Äôm glad I FOMOed SPY 30 minutes before close scalped a sweet $15 hunskies 

The trick to making money is find out when cashflow buys put then buy calls 

Literally can‚Äôt go tits up
As holder of too many warrants I demand my voice be heard and I want big tiddied goth chicks involved in this new media empire

I can‚Äôt believe people fly southwest they‚Äôre sooooooooo expensive. Even accounting for free bags and all that. Flight to Phoenix on Southwest is $2,400, the same as a first class ticket on Delta!

Calls on LUV?
It was actually Apple.
It's an English rock band, supertramp
1.5 B market cap is joke, upside is there
Oh TSLA pumped
Any hopes for tesla 915C tomorrow ?
I totally understand that as a longer term outlook, but right now we are in the middle of a rally and I find it hard to believe that just SNAP is gonna pullback the market tomorrow or even next week.
The beer market is so competitive it‚Äôs a miracle Sam Adam‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt gone out of business yet. Their beer isn‚Äôt up to the task.

Wake me when options become available ü•≠
OH SNAP
No it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs 1.80 euro/liter I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre getting your numbers from
Same thing that happened to facebook. Where you you been?  It is all snaps fault
I didn‚Äôt get in until the mid-40s.  Sucks.  Put $450ish in there, maybe I should‚Äôve put more since this might have legs to run up quite a bit, but I also could see it suddenly dumping hard and losing thousands of dollars.
It happens to small caps and micro caps all the time but not that very often to companies valued at $120 billion.
its its even a somewhat of a compitition against twitter it will do well.  Its gonna pull a lot of people from FOXNEWS who are down 50% in ratings.

I think putting it at 20$ range is fair this year.  See what launch looks like in February.
Tsla puts are never a good idea. Buy calls or stay away.
They sell burritos......  A burrito stock is almost at 2000

Likely to be a ton of shorting/put buying (when options available) at some point.

Half a BILLION in volume, no way can it match that again. Also this wasn't just retail. Some big GOP hedges took major advantage of this and will do the same on the way down. 

Also there are tons of 'political' people who don't own a single individual stock, that doesn't really mean anything.

Picked up some SNAP calls at the end of today, I have a good feeling they're going to crush earnings üòè
Exactly. The "social media" service is probably going to be like his last one, a blog, or like the other 3 that tried to start up for this same purpose... in 6 months, the bag holders are going to wonder how they got scammed.
Oh yeah, I know what I‚Äôm buying when the market opens.

A pump this retarded is gonna have some legs for a couple days.
Wish I got in at open this morning or my investment would‚Äôve 5xed already, but I was asleep at the wheel aka actually working.

No offense but this dip is not going to be 1 or 2 days.. tappering will start, stores will not have products, delivery and supply chains will grind to  a hault for Christmas. I know u mean well but yeah.
Snap just fumbled the entire market in the 4th quarter

How much bigger did your peen get?
Perfect ticker name
he hasn't even started pumping his stock yet to his followers. Just the announcement of him running for President he was doing shitty in the polls and everyone was laughing. Then when he started rallying and pumping he won the whole fucking shit. Imagine when he starts pumping this.

I think it has 1-2 days more of pumping but 200? Wouldnt that make it more valuable than twitter?

Nope! Friday, smacked botty for naff tech is rocket fuel for SP straights.

I have 15 snap puts and $4,000 in intel puts. Also I‚Äôm not a bear unless I‚Äôm in a bear market. I‚Äôm just not a dumb permabull who really thinks stocks only go up because they‚Äôve only been in the market for the easiest period in market history. 16 year old kids are making money in the market yet y‚Äôall thought y‚Äôall where actually good investors because y‚Äôall did to.

Cowards took profit then the boomers found out about it. Much better than the freedom phone, this is a unique opportunity for them to send a message with their money. Boomers have been silenced and stifled their whole lives. Now they can vote with their pocketbooks.
Rotation back into GameStop?
Terrible earnings, blaming apple for add blocking (super short version)
I agree 100%. I‚Äôve always liked the product since the beginning. A lot of customers loved their product. Just stick to what you to best and improve the product‚Ä¶not the business.

idk if we divide market cap by share price to get outstanding shares then JackTwat has 800M outstanding shares no?   


I think PedoJoe has \~37M outstanding  


if we assume that PedoJoe will be worth what JackTwat is worth then we looking at $1.4k a share right?   


so if people assume it's worth 20% of JackTwat then the value would be like $350 a share no?   


tbh I think that's the idea, people see pedoJoe has having the same market cap as TwatJack in a few years

lol that sham stock will go back up dont worry. You are playing in the right direction. Between hedge funds and them buying back their stock at record rates, it will eventually go to 2200. The float is super low.
It hit 900. Does it have to stay 900? And for how long?

Say what you want about Cathie Wood, but she emptied every share of SNAP a few months ago at a $7 million gain
Yes, you are the only one seeing that
At least it‚Äôs not SNAP levels of shitting the bed, yet at least lmao
In a society built on ad revenue and selling stuff instead of manufacturing. Makes sense.

That snap candle is fucking hilarious
Just need a 2% pre-earnings pump on BABA by next Friday, and I‚Äôll be happy.
I‚Äôm listening to this snap call and tbh it sounds good past the apple privacy block. This seems like an overreaction just like with pton. Snap moving in on Netflix‚Äôs territory tho wtf???

Oof
It had a 12 dollar gap in the charts since the last earnings that never filled. Glad to see its coming back down to reality. It will go back up though since there will be a gap in the opposite direction. When will it go up? Who knows? It could keep falling.
I like the company may grab 50 shares
my ONLY regret is that i didnt buy more and that i sold too early and literally every decision leading up to today
Google is stronger than spy

Wait yea it did go to 900.00 at 11:50. Can we get a modcheck lol
Well my PayPal 10/29 255c are completely dead now. PayPal fucking murdered AH. There goes the last dollar I had. Hope a fucking bus just ends me tomorrow
umm msft
Bought 1000 at $16.30 a pop still holding on hope and it‚Äôs looking promising
Anything good happen today?
Tomorrow will be exactly like the day FB missed. Futues down bigly until 8:30am, then down littly, drop $1 first 3min of trading and then pump $2 into close
You mean pay for no ads and no cookies? Yup, but that‚Äòs not what FAANG wants, hence eg $50/month youtube
SNAP?
Of all the plays I could have chosen. The one i did choose is down 10% in two days. PYPL out here looking like a failed biotech company.
ROKU never had any business getting to where it was beyond Cathie just pumping it like all the other trash she got going at the beginning of the year
TSLA 920 tomorrow?
Brandi Love's pu$$y is open as well
Lmaoooo yall really think spy dropping tomorrow? Don't be silly now.  You know spy be off that Henny. 460 tomorrow.
You bought calls at the high of that day, didn‚Äôt you ehh
A lot of money to be made tbh. Late to the party now, but when people were in lockdown they spent money up the ass on collectibles. Cards have gone up several hundred percent in the last couple years.
Donald whack
I literally have no motivation to work. I‚Äôm fully committed to quitting my job in January and taking some time off but I‚Äôm still so stressed about all the projects at work that I‚Äôm falling behind on
Looks like new SNAP investors just became long-term bagholders

Dude, roll it up tomorrow. I used to hold and got my face eaten too many times on good contracts... now I sell and buy again at a higher strike when I've got profit. You lose a little delta doing that but depending on far up you are and how much you're rolling up, it's not gonna matter. What'll be interesting is if it can hold past $120 tomorrow.
Anyone with SNAP puts tomorrow will be enjoying their day thoroughly
I‚Äôm buying IBM and I don‚Äôt care what y‚Äôall say

How does the market cap limit work? I know it‚Äôs at 1.5B, but is that the live minute to minute market cap, or close of the previous day?
It‚Äôs holding the line above $11 which is good

Take a look at most opinions, that alone should make you comfortable. It'll be green.
"Reality can be whatever I want" -SNAP

**-23%**
I sold half at least
Cause it's only social media companies that got hitted. Both Netflix and Tesla ran up after earnings despite initial drop.
They crushed earnings despite all chip and economic headwinds. They continue to increase profit. Their production nearly doubles year over year.  They pay down debt early.  What‚Äôs not to like?
Intel what do you do my guy
We should change all US dollars from green to orange‚Ä¶. Every coin and bill should have trumps face on them‚Ä¶ we should erect 50ft gold statues of his perfection in every public space nationwide. All first born sons should be required to be named Donald followed by a subsequent number.
I think I‚Äôm just retarded enough to buy 0 DTE FB calls at open
just saw SNAP

i bet they'll buy the dip on this piece of shit next week
Yea just remove murder from the law. Ppl get murdered anyways.

Snap way over sold. Buying up after hours on this dip is easy money
yeah but it's 10/29 $80 calls best case scenario i can recoup some of it but i bet so wrong on this one lmao. would be loss porn material if i put more down but we'll see
it'll snap back tomorrow
Those are some big market caps getting their face ripped off.

Somebody must have covered, sheesh
#bought 0dte BB 11.5‚Äôs before close. Leggoooooo
cuz it wants to go up another 2000%!
Of course the dips will be filled, but I just want to know ‚Ä¶ is there anyone here who remembers what life was like before FB?  You know, when kids used to play outside, etc?
Sooooo SPY red tomorrow ü§î
$snap made a lot of bag holders tonight
Naked call?
lol ru for real
I already bought a shit ton of that at close.

how tf are futures green üò≠
Yeah I can see that. I think PYPL sucks, honestly, but it will come back. Always a huge market overreaction anytime the news is slightly bad. Like SNAP, they missed earnings by literally 2.8%, and then their price drops over 25%. Even companies whose earnings far exceed expectations, stock plummets. Pretty sure the market hates any news and wants to just go its own path. Who knows. Im holding 1/20/23 SPY 675c, and Im enjoying the ride to glory
Yes
Ok well let‚Äôs say after hour isn‚Äôt looking to good what would make it reverse and gap up?
SPY $455 tmo
At the end of the day, tech stocks are the only stocks that consistently bring in revenue.

The rest are speculative plays and pump and dumps.
Facebook will recover tomorrow. Buy the dip if you see one.
But I thought it was due to Apple and not advertisers spending less in general so Roku shouldn‚Äòt be affected at all but well its always like that

So how sure are we that snap stays that low? I got a straddle and put is obviously printing hard if nothing happens premarket so how much will it bounce back any ideas?
what happens if you win?
$74
Holy fuck I sold it when it was $13
Hurry up and get 100 so you can sell CCs
Up 6k this week ans hope I don‚Äôt lose it all tomorrow
I'm one of the few people that has made a killing on BB stock this year.  Some time it's just good to take your chips off the table and take a breather.  Done pretty good on O&amp;G lately too.  

I'm looking everywhere for junk to buy, but it all seems overvalued.
Facebook has taken a dump after SNAP was snapped
Same brother I literally went all in.
anyone still gonna buy FB calls? if so, why?
SNAP got Thanos snapped after ER
Full story?
Mission accomplished
Groundhog day, everyone was so sure TSLA was fucked too...
Oh wow Snapchat hit 75% of 13 year olds. So proud of them...
Snap says advertisers spending less and chopped their future revenue guidance by like 30% and people are extrapolating this to mean lower advertiser spending for digital advertisers across the board.
Snap is garbage anyways prays on kids for profit

Threw them into amd 119c this morning! Expecting the stock to go up some more tomorrow since intel be dropping
[deleted]
Right now you can't but tomorrow maybe SPY
How did snap ever get to 83 ü§£
Really tough to decide if I wanna take my winnings and run on this one or ride it out. I‚Äôm up 60% on the call I got about a month back.
Snap back to reality;

ope there goes gravity.
Why the flying poonani is mentioning the biggest 'bet' of the last 6 months banned??
Should hopefully be in the money on my snap 60 puts expiring tomorrow. My calls are clapped for sure
I dont know if anything could save this ngl
God said "Not again..."
TSLA did OK today.  It crushed ER, and was unchanged at the open... then went up 40 points.
The answer to everything right now is SNAP lol
Oh yeah... SPACS will be GREAT AGAIN.
To the people that bitch about big tech and the privacy they infringe upon or data they store and collect...you literally have no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes.

You bundle all your hatred towards Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc. but every goddam app or website you're visiting is tracking you in SOME aspect because I know you fuckers don't think twice about hitting accept when it comes to those cookie modals.

My company uses a service that can capture like 200 different fields of data depending on what you do throughout your time spent on our suite of websites.

TL;DR: Welcome to 2021; buy the tech dip retards.
Go broku
where have u been all september
Should have bought poots.
PYPL is the buy sell snap bs
It happened to me .
Nothing I said was political
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Probably a reaction to that, shouldnt really affect them much. I think yields will just hurt tech tomorrow regardless
[deleted]
AMD calls about an hour and a half ago
Hope that CMG recovers from it's amazing ER ...  it was up 40 points, and now it's down 40 points.

I hate low volume stocks.
[deleted]
As a European, I kind of hope Mango Unchained has a +120% day tomorrow.
It‚Äôs already recovering..Now from$22 to $17 loss
There were a LOT of pump n dumps going on and the hundreds of SPACs didn‚Äôt help that. It sucks but I don‚Äôt doubt that the ü•≠ ticker will be above the threshold by tomorrow open so problem solved.
üåà
SNAP better say some compelling money making shit on this call
[fuck your puts](https://i.redd.it/ql6thdiapgv51.jpg)
Gapping down it seems*
RIOT bbgirl please come back
Spy 0dte calls FUUUUUUUUKD ü§£
And everyone's stop loss got triggered
TSLA gapping up tomorrow?
AMD been relentless
When my ban bet comes I need you all to know I did it for glory and god
they'll just make us pay AND still spy on us anyway
At the local top
I love you Sara!
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away.

Now it looks as though  üåàüêªs are here to stay
me. bought a put.
CRAMER is the type of person....
WED NIGHT: Buy SNAP everyone is using it everyone loves it and stock is gonna make a run after earnings
THURS NIGHT: I told you to sell SNAP no one is using it and the business model is dying and earnings will not look good---bail now!!!
CAP
Anyone knows what happened to Roku AH?
Who got Thanos SNAPped?

Don‚Äôt cluck the Duck ü¶Ü
This looks like a repeat of previous Tech earning calls. All the stocks rally all the way till earnings and dump hard on the earnings day.
What options would you throw 1k into rn?
Im def getting puts asap.

Using an existing Open Source platform, programming in Drupal, and most likely wont fix any security flaws and they will have a ton of them, etc.

Plus where are they gonna host it? China? Russia?
C group PE is under 7 now, stop the count! End the Citi prejudice! End the hate! Stock should be at 100 minimum to be in line with the other big banks! End racism!
I like this sort of confirmation bias.
Snap casually beating average daily volume in AH
Yes, eip
This is also what Facebook pointed out earlier which caused their stock to start dropping even before the 60 minutes expos√®
Ok what happened to google fuck
It's not a knife you fucker
That‚Äôs enough for me let‚Äôs buy
Thought I got slick buying leaps only to throw on my mask ü§°
23%
A lot of neck going to make snap sound tonight
Faxxx
This would be a perfect double top on all assets you did it again batman
Rip my FB calls

F
Shoulda gone with Google!
So you are saying it will recover enough for puts not to print.
This dumbass bear is already celebrating. How‚Äôs your week been buddy? SPY still up 2.2% for the week
Good
1.705
Why I like the idea, how do people think they get so many cool products for free? Are people ready to pay for Social media?
Sit in cash and wait for a correction
Gonna watch BODY go either up or down.
17,19,26 of December.
End of the world in his mind. Bout to sign up for squid game.
When in doubt blame Apple, inflation and/or labor shortages.
Fidelity may be a bunch of old ass cunts, but they don't allowing shorting if they don't have shares, so you're never forced to close.
Not everything is a conspiracy.
He hates facebook cause they held off launching under 13 Instagram
And they actually gained users, the dip is a HUGE overreaction
So what the hell is going on with Tesla?
Guys buy the DIP .. i am sure it‚Äôs the institutional AI who dumped the stocks following algorithms
"SNAP down 25% on news that Mango is coming out with his own social media platform. Stay tuned."
üß¢ user growth is up 23%
so many SNAP bagholders are gonna be listening to the Earnings calls
Date on those?
[deleted]
$OCGN üíâ
I only use it to send dick pics to my mum but even that‚Äôs dying off.
Which fuckers were in snap    ?
Bonds are popping off. Boomers salivating
Shoulda bought one instead üò¢
my yolo SNAP call order did not fill. this makes up for the losses I had in september
Ban or bet it
Yes sorta
&gt; yeah
&gt;Adjusted earnings per share: 17 cents vs. 8 cents by Refinitiv

&gt;Revenue: $1.07 billion vs. $1.10 billion forecast by Refinitiv

&gt;Global daily active users (DAUs): 306 million vs. 301.8 million per StreetAccount

&gt;Average revenue per user (ARPU): $3.49 vs. $3.67 per StreetAccount


Not terrible.
No
Ban
More than half the sub. Reason? Because it mooned last earnings
Tried to catch the falling knife on PayPal
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Gambled4MyRangeRover (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 900.0 when it was 870.11 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Just wait till they report earnings too
[deleted]
Why did amazon flash tank after bell??
Related to snap or what?
I managed that one already. Our common friend will take care of him.
jays 401k is literally 100% in SPY lol

also the only thing they banned was buying individual tickers and active trading, they can buy ETFs like SPY and hold them without issue
Gonna snap up some SQQQ while we're at it.....
Slow clap
SPY dip fake and stupid - this is just a normal AH overreaction, tomorrow SNAP will recover to like -8%, SPY will probably finish between 452-454, may even see some green tomorrow. SPY 452-454 calls are totally fucked, so good luck if you had those, but anyone with long calls, no worries, carry on
I thought they dont want to work
NIO 50 EOM
will be crying in the corner cauz i didn't bought those TESLA 900 calls when it was 850......

T\_T
They're 0DTE, a drop to 45 would be better
That wouldn‚Äôt surprise me the slightest
Praying for ya bud lmk how it goes I‚Äôm curious
Then buy nvda or AMD
Based on my 2 scroll ups with my thumb I take it that snap is down?
SNAP blamed it on AAPL terms of service changes.  Any company that depends on ad revenue is down hard rn
You‚Äôll see
People talking about evergrande crashing spy for weeks but it‚Äôs going to be apple lol
Heathen
DWACW to the fuckin MOON TOMORROW
[deleted]
Okay that actually makes some sense, didn‚Äôt even realize that was going on. Thanks brother
Fucking excited to start getting it on the cheap...
Did it drop to -0.3%???
You‚Äôre about to have some pissed off incels yelling in your comments soon. Gullible reactionaries don‚Äôt do good with things like facts and reality.
Naw don't buy into that narrative, that's how bagholders are created in a bubble. 

TSLA is an outlier, and the fact that we're finally starting to take climate change seriously is a big part in its current overvaluation. But SNAP is a social media company, making its overvaluation even more irrational
Nothing says trust like cashing out and switching to mutual funds. If Jay wants people to trust the Fed they should be going all in on all the speculative bubbles they created‚Ä¶
üòÖüë®‚Äçüç≥ü§åüèº
Listen up pussy were not here to debate politics were here to make money. I don‚Äôt give a shit if orangeman bad I want orangeman to make me green
Holy shit Snap down 25%
More $DWAC
AAPL just being a gigachad. Up AH while the rest of tech gets violated
Can‚Äôt wait for the snap loss porn tomorrow
Buying another 100k mgc pharmaceutical shares wait for moon take off. Cimetra cures long covid the trials have showed clearly. 25 Mill order already.  Sweet sale aswell
My puts needed this thank you üçä
How many lives did Apple just destroy today?
R.Kelly likes SNAP because he thinks its a dating app for HS chicks
So many SNAP bagholders now saying ohhhh it‚Äôs coming back up only down 23% now üòÇ
Just yolo the snap dip. Big overreaction on earnings.
IV was not super high so you should be good
Ded
PayPal to acquire snap
Whatchu mean fool it says starts at 5 ET?
SAM, not SNAP
lol GUILTY, but but chip shortage!
Won‚Äôt get my new phone I ordered today until mid December, aapl wat the fahk
They need Apple to get this to ATH before we get to 0
so how was snap earnings?
We literally had -1.3% dips after hours just last month
Lol have fun with those puts.
Not again...
Already did
US Government buying those dips
[deleted]
Dayum 10 year about to cross 1.7
Snap said apple new privacy settings fucked with advertiser‚Äôs efficiency so advertiser‚Äôs started spending less which most assume will be across the board for advertising related tech.
You should get off the internet for awhile
Prayers man, baller move
Me too. I was feeling bad for missing the bounce.
Sir you‚Äôre late they shit the bed
who got SNAP calls lmfao
I've been checking out $EAR. Seems to be in an interesting situation. Was $70 earlier in the year and had a +30% run today back to $10. I don't think it's worth $70, but I could easily see it doubling in price. Anyone think this is a particularly retarded play? Seems like a relatively straight forward oversold and recovering to FMV move.
Funny how that old sack of shit hated him but is buying his stock lmao
https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500

Check this out, a lot of big hitters are down multiple points

Also, no, SNAP is not in SPY but that‚Äôs irrelevant to the point I was trying to make. Ad revenue is down, and the cause for that may impact a number of big companies in SPY.
I‚Äôm in it but have a hard time believing that it‚Äôd actually tank every other stock that hard while it has such a small market cap in comparison
CNBC guy talking up snap looks so defeated
[deleted]
It will big time, but 5x 10/22 75.50P have to earn more than 5.7k, my cost basis for the 15x call leg I bought.

doin fuzzy math... with IV crush it'll be close
Just getting dragged down because SNAP is down 25%.
How many more signs and hints do people need to know the top was in? The fed was trying to make this easy on you yet you chose to be greedy. Instead of blaming bears, Biden, Cramer, Burry etc: look in the mirror. I mean wipe the tears off your face first but then look in the mirror.
Where's the guys with a Fuck load of snap put! I'm excited for him üòÇ
Banking on a fucking juicy SAM earnings report in 5 minutes üí¶üí¶üí¶
JACK MA
Yeah I sent a message to our common friend. They live together and he is gonna keep an eye on him. Not that he will kill himsef but at least he will
help him get thru tonight.
# SNAP Call Holders wellness check
[deleted]
Look at how Snap moved the entire market. Rip snap holders
Ho Lee Fuk. Over 24k on 1 DTE OTM puts. You sir are an absolutely masterful retard. This deserves its own thread.
it rhymes with Fahrenheit
Made 230% gains on bb.   Sold the gains.  Bought more calls further out with all the gains.   All or nothing
SNAP needs to buy OnlyFans....only way to make consistent money
It was nice that we got to set one last ATH today for old times sake.
AAPL mooning now?? WTH is happening
so everyone and their mothers gonna buy the SNAP dip tomorrow?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Sauce?
Also, Epstein didn't kill himself.
Not up 50% anymore üòÇ
Pickup
r.i.p. 10/22 snap calls
Why is FB getting crushed on Snap news?
It will, they're gonna shake the tree before the AZ facilities fire-up....
We buying the snap dip or what?
Apple messed up the ads industry. Look at SNAP
I should've bought the straddle on snap but no I had to be bullish
After 365 days, I am up 26%. I was up 140% in February.
BB all day every day
Snap just died
Bc üüß always wins
When you get pulled in a meeting and forget to sell those calls that expire tomorrow up 50% .
Not as bad as CHWY
Market is sus rn
 maybe they want to compete? They did try with iTunes that one time.
Nasdaq is getting hit tomorrow
Trump already put all social media out of business in just a day!
The fuck your think GOOGs been doing behind the scenes? ü•¥
To peg the üåàüêª
Cheers bro
Why is GOOG down after hours? Can't find news on it.
Dude probably needs a friend right now. Why don't you buy a six pack and knock on his door.
[deleted]
It's not just SNAP. It's every social media anything.

*I have never owned SNAP btw*
Bro I can barely see your feet‚Ä¶. You ok?
Major guh, shits down 25% AH
Oh SNAP!
My calls do too+
i wouldn't be on apple rn. THey're having biiiig trouble with supply chains.
They‚Äôll then realise that they actually do have to moderate content but will suck at doing it, just like everyone else. 
The second I can, I‚Äôm gonna short the crap out of truth social
Apple‚Äôs new privacy setting made it harder for advertisers to be efficient so advertisers spent less. Pointing to digital advertising slowdown across the board which is a lot of these tech company‚Äôs bread and butter.
Lmfao yeah, but of course I bought because rabid maga boys gonna pump this shit tomorrow.
How many just got SNAPped into the poor house?
Lot of grown men at my work trading heavy with Pokemon cards.
Hey guys. Why do I be so dumb sometimes? I have the tools to be somewhat smart? Why I be dumb tho
Fell 0.19%...
I've never been more excited to short something in my life. LOL
[deleted]
Never knew an app used by thots would make the market tank
SNAP earnings + 10y at 1.7% = no bueno for my tech calls

***FED CHAIRMEN SOLD AT THE TOP.***

September 2021

=== =====

NEVER FORGET.
IBM, INTC, SNAP have all sucked
Nah that put is gonna print
If you're buying the SNAP dip I hope you make bank but I'll be happy to sneak out at even or minimally down, people's true colors are coming out about snap, not just here, but everyone says that the kids don't use it anymore and adults don't care and it's useless to them.
Lmao at WSB we always üíéüôå
BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi reports sizeable stake in orange man media.
Not true at all
Lolol snap

Was worried my 75 straddle would eat dirt but it‚Äôs spiegel eating dirt instead
I guess the positive thing is that this Apple privacy issue will be priced in by the time the other social media companies have earnings
R u ok?
US10Y 1.7%. Nothing to see here, guys ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Democrats aren‚Äôt passing sht too
My guess is there‚Äôs worries about digital advertising. Thus why snap reporting tanked Facebook, google and the trade desk, among others.
I hope so, I put $9.4k in.  Mad I bought at 39 and not 29, jumped as I was selling other assets
You ok?
Snapchat drops 30%? I am in.
Oh my god spy is forming a volcano
so glad i bought a cheap call instead of selling a put which is what i was thinking of doing because it would be "safer" lol
Facebook long term IRA!
While I expect FB to regain a significant amount by open tommorow, Im hoping it doesnt because I decided to yolo FB puts for tommorow right before close.

Rekt
I realized that today after SNAP
How much you down on snap AH?
I bought all I could when it was sub 55 - trying to average down.  I don't know if it will be green by open, but it's seeing more action now than it did all day.
Should I buy snap calls? Which should I buy?
Is cramer fucking with us? He claims tesla is worth 1k but he also hates wsb and knows we watch him. 

Inversing him maybe the play. He wanted to destroy wsb
I actually hate the idea of targeted ads. Thanks apple
1.699
IBM heard a WSBer oggle that SNAP was worth more earlier today &amp; is now giggling a lil +0.3% AH
Ridiculous
Warning for all Ad companies for sure
Pretty big overreaction imo, but also fuck snap. The shit that goes public is ridiculous nowadays. 

Anyways my 453c spy is fucked tomorrow isn't it?
Apple privacy policy affecting SNAPs numbers. 

Google ad revenue from users on iPhone is probably assumed to be affected as well.
PLOT TWIST = GOOG gonna crush ad revenues again!

Bunch of that $400m snap missed in ad sales went to Google üòÜ
Dang what's going on with GOOGL?
Dudes making teddy bear pics out of their face deserve to lose money.

Full stop.
Motherfucker this ain‚Äôt a dip its a crater
So all the bulls are mega rich this week huh?
SPY just fucking tanked!!!!
Why the hell can‚Äôt we say the ticker? Wtf happened to this sub Jesus Christ
In the pool on my floaty and smoking a cigar. Can‚Äôt talk 

https://imgur.com/a/yKi7tJQ
I don‚Äôt know if -23% is creeping back up
I've been an Android user all my life but Apple's stance is fucking awesome. Seriously considering an iPhone next. Fuck SNAP, TWTR, FB and all this garbage

ü§°
Can't wait to see the 12/17 70P I bought for $4.15 ü§§
Bruh I can tell you its intrinsic value but who knows what IV will look like in the morning.
10 $75 puts
Lmao company created overnight. Plans to merge with a chinese special purpose acquisition company. Claims to have an upcoming beta when when use open source social media platform Mastadon and just remove the branding from it. Already having problems and it's really obvious this thing is going to have massive security flaws.


Claims to be a free speech platform but go talk shit about their site or insult their cult leader and I guarantee you'll be banned immediately. In fact free seech to them means they want to post racist stuff, cp, plot terrorist acts, spread insane conspiracy theories, etc.


Claimed their platform already got hacked. By hacked they mean someone found the site and signed up through the normal process and were able to grab the names "mike pence" or "donald trump" or "donald j trump" and thrn proceeded to post pictures of wild animals shitting
Should I buy calls?
I feel like people are being pretty reactionary, I feel like SNAP‚Äôs sell off is making a mountain out of a molehill. They had marginal losses to ad revenue and guidance, but I don‚Äôt think that justifies a 22% dip
Thanks you fucken Dongus
I sold a $75P on SNAP üòµ‚Äçüí´
Agree. Going to be much harder for you IMO.
INTC big oof
Gonna go with no?
This thing rockets 357% in 1 day and people talk about snap and intc
Exactly, the drop was a gigantic overreaction
SNAPped out of existence
God damn I look good
Snap said the N word
Already recovered $2000, $12k to go before extended hours closing

PS: recovered $3.8k
94%
Some people are better off trading baseball cards. Stocks just bring them to financial ruin
Yes snap longs .
thinking of selling my COIN calls and buying up Etsy calls
INTL is a miniscule part of SPY.  Is SNAP even in SPY?

Meanwhile, plenty of other tech is up.  AMD, NVDA

I don't get the AH dip
Why is tech dumping? DUDE TQQQ NOOOOOO
Snap blaming revenue loss on labor shortages lmao everybody is quitting their jobs they dont give a fuck anymore. Work sucks.
Market right now is brutal on even small missed earnings.
One could expect no less coming from a üçä Genius.
PYPL. Got a nice haircut below the ema. If that ain‚Äôt a dip I don‚Äôt know what is.
pray for a rebound into 65
Why is that? $FSLY can go up to 100$ by EOY.
Cliff diving anyone?
Nope. Fuck SNAP. That shit belongs to the dumpster
Not sure holding trump bucks overnight is the smartest move but oh well! Doin it anyway
No matter your feelings on the company, this dip on SNAP is the deal of the month. Buy it.
This made my dick hard
It‚Äôs already starting to go back up
Don‚Äôt forget the cheese fries
tbh one of the funniest memes of the last year
The bigger money was in fb and goog puts
After hours priced in.
U should check to see if he‚Äôs okay
I popped in here to see if I could glean why Google just dipped and it looks like as best as I can tell Snapchat now controls the fate of the entire market and Tim Apple is our only hope? I'm not sure if I'm reading this all right.
Big tech calls shopping tomorrow
Futures will be green and we will decide they matter tonight.
Earnings, motherfucker.
I can just imagine hundreds of thousands of put holders of Snap slowly losing their erections right now. Hundreds of pounds of blood moving from penises to bodies as Snap slowly creeps back up from after hour buyers who know what over sold means.
Amd hit before my own dd, I should be banned for a week for doubting
You bought SNAP shares?
snap is the canary in the mine
I know a lot of us love AAPL, and a lot of us have AAPL, and a lot of us respect what AAPL is doing for consumers. But this has gone too far and we have to take it out back and shoot it. üçé üî´
CLF going to beat earnings tomorrow or what?
ya this looking fishier and fishier.
gap filled on SNDL looking to add more. Chart starting to look bullish!
SNAP shits the bed showing big cracks in overvalued growth stocks which has knock on effects throughout tech. Bond yields rise above 1.7% overnight approaching pre-pandemic highs. Evergrande formal default on Saturday is the final nail in the coffin.

Grats
EARNINGS SEASON IS THE BEST SEASON
Praying for that dude who had leaps that were up 1000%. I mean he‚Äôs fine but still, rough day.
You can't say the ticker but you can say the word SPAC.
This guy definitely looks boring enough to be the Dow ceo.
Everyday we steer further away from God, and it's because I am captain of this ship.
SNAP is free money right now. Too bad I can't buy calls after hours
Well that makes no sense because my comments auto delete every 24 hours.  Maybe that's why you cant find shit.
That wasn‚Äôt a dip...
Who else is shorting UPS next week?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Do you all ever feel like an absolute G when you buy a call and next day you nearly double your money?  


$YETI
Did Nasdaq just drop 60% while I took a shower?
Same, kills meh. Still, might buy the dip tomorrow. Ain't nothing changed about the company
Giardiniera is in, social media is out
big lol. "almost certainly"

more like PreciousHoldinBagsins
$FB over here
Bye
After Hours is a blood bath today. All my gains wiped.
ü•≠'s SPAC is the most successful SPAC in history. He can say that and it will be the absolute truth.
and then a minimal dump goes
I can't wait to short that new social media company I've been reading about.
What a great buying opportunity for SNAP, I just sold everything that wasn‚Äôt bolted to the floor to buy more of it
[Should've listened to /u/1r0nyman](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppmyal/now_you_know/hd5pi21/)
I'm grabbing up facebook in lieu of averaging down on snap. Might actually sell that one as a loss for once.
My co-worker stopped playing stocks 3 weeks ago because he lost so much. He admitted that he has gambling problem.

Today he sent me a chat at 4pm saying he bought SNAP calls....

Holy shit. I don't know if I should feel bad for him since I told him many times to stay away from stocks.
Ok I ll take that
OOOOOOOOO this after hours JUICY.  also your daily reminder that AH doesn't matter at all unless you have volume, of which most of the sell offs don't.
Only the skins sir
*Fed members sell stocks at ATH*

‚ÄúHey that‚Äôs messed up!‚Äù

*Jay waits until ATH again to say no more owning stocks*

Jay: ‚ÄúOkay now we have sell‚Äù ü§°
Did ya buy the snap dip son?
Completely forgot snap earnings was today fml almost bought puts on them yesterday shiiiittt
Another night of red followed by a day of green. Fuck me for being a üåàüêª.
RIP
lol shoulda straddled SNAP more evenly. Holding a 1:1 straddle on SAM, that'll print, but not sure my 3:1 call/put straddle on SNAP is gonna break even.
Please tell me next moves. Thanks
SNAP SIUUUUUUUUUUUUU
You mean how today was also supposed to be the day the music stopped?
apple changed rules-less tracking users=worse ads=less profits=gotta sell stocks with profits from ads like PINS FB SNAP SPOT
Lmfao keep dreaming

You need the inflatable one with hand pump, custom fit with every pump
I find IBM being up after hours hilarious
Not buying this dip is almost unforgivable 

Don‚Äôt cluck the Duck ü¶Ü
The market was going to act like it wasn‚Äôt a flaming bag of shit for Halloween, but then it realized it‚Äôs scarier just being itself, a flaming bag of shit.
GOOG and FB calls
Good luck to you too.
US Economy crashing because of Snapchat earnings wasn‚Äôt on my bingo card but I‚Äôll be üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà for a day if my $450 puts print
Automod is a bro
SNAP I KNOW IT HURTS, BUT YOU GOTTA BUY NOW, NO FEAR!
I mean it dipped AF..

Guys I have no clue how much its worth.  I honestly forgot I bought it.  I assume it will be up bigly lol.
What's going on? Why some major stocks tanking AH???
hahaha only wishing i'd bought more
p h a g g o t s
I just hope this means we get our focus shifted to Asia stocks and get sea limited to 380 tomorrow
Was looking at snap puts today. Oh well
No one cares about DOW Inc. Talk about SNAP and Intel CNBC
[deleted]
It's rebounding.  Somebody is going to put the screws to them before they have a chance to print tomorrow.
As long as dating apps and nudes exists, SNAP is going to be fine
It‚Äôs the rate at which everything is falling my man
üòÇ what bro
I already have a Facebook 465 banbet and options backing that up too FML
You'll be wishing you held them 457 spy calls going into tomorrow. I'll never go against the bull again üíØ
It will... Watch üòé
Glad I sold my spy calls eod
Who else bought the snap dip?üí∞ Green by open?
Don‚Äôt forget, the Fed Presidents were ‚Äúforced to sell‚Äù a couple weeks ago
&gt; I'm not retarded, I just don't care about the market.
Bought 8 @ 352 today ü§ûüèª

Why is snap dying
You can't remember the last time you saw -0.22% after hours on SPY? You must be retarded
SPY open at $500
You forgot to say banbet
thats what i meant ofc..!
Always close these positions before close....never know what's going to happen AH
#MakeSNAPGreatAgain
That's true.

But this seems overreaction a bit as it's two prong.

Tim Apple privacy factor and ad spent factor from supply chain disruption.

I think GOOGL is the easy buy here and FB still too. Easier to go boomer shares tho and/or leaps.
Lol
Rules don't matter anymore. Look at Tesla, yet this sub keeping jerking their load all over the 4680
I bought 150 10/22 456c's but I also bought 50 10/22 450p's at 3:59 lol shew! I may be saved.
üòÇ
Scrolls through your comments looking for you telling a bull that they‚Äôre being salty and just ignore it. Funny wonder why I can‚Äôt find anything.
Well that was a nice little run while it lasted.

I simply have no choice but to buy the SNAP dip
Ban Bet
Snap
Sir this is no longer fud it will be confirmed
U can tell this guy gets his news from WSB ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Tomorrow will hurt. Futures will almost certainly hit -5% circuit breakers. Instant FUD at open into another circuit breaker 20 minutes in. Repeat
[deleted]
I remember when snap was a meme stock here and trading in the 10s and 11s consistently. Looks like it's going to be heading back there
I missed the scoop on SNAP. Fill me in.
They‚Äôre ads didn‚Äôt bring in as much money because of new Apple policies?
I was so fucking close to buying SNAP puts but then thought IV crush would kill them. Still wish I bought
I'd say 50-51.

But, it's oversold.
SNAP and INTL. Snap lost significant revenue due to limitations with ad revenue sources. Generally speaking the market seems to be taking this as a sign of weakness in tech. In my opinion it‚Äôs an over reaction.

Edit: to expand on this, the expectation is for other companies that rely on ad revenue to also see a big decline in their earning reports.
facts same!@
I'm gonna need a bigger butt plug.
Remember, the market always zigs when you zag
Apple just dashed all hopes of SPY hitting ATH tomorrow.
If you thought INTC was going to pump on earnings you might literally be retarded.
#PLEASE LET THE AMD-XILINX MERGER BE COMPLETE

Kind of retarded how piece of shit SNAPchat can have a shitty quarter and contagion spreads to big tek
~~37~~.11
Catsup or ketchup?
This is gonna be bumpy earnings season, god damn
SPY just did a "call an ambulance, but not for me" flip at the end there
sold my 10/29 qqq puts for a $600 loss, sigh...
Ope, there goes Rabbit
They unbanned me
If Facebook rebounds from -25$ before market open I‚Äôll legit find Mark and give him the longest zucc of his life.
FB would control us all with their metaverse. Buy the dip and become a shareholder or Zuck would give you a micro penis.
I will admit, somebody SNAPed my balls and I'm in a bit of pain right now.  The pain didn't stop me from buying more SNAP while it was sub 55.
wtf just happened to spy and tech??? wtf?
Ope, there goes Rabbit
thank goodness I didn‚Äôt buy SNAP calls
lmao holy shit. SNAP had $2.5B in revenue in 2020 and *had* $120B in market cap. No shit they were due for a huge correction
0.5 trillion
What was the word?
lol down boy
FB is slowly gaining‚Ä¶ buy the DIP if you can
Hasn't this happened before? Where snapchat shit the bed and somehow the entire Nasdaq goes down in sympathy to this fucking meme app company lmao
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/Zen0d0x** bet **SPY** goes from **452.8** to **480.0** before **2021-11-04 16:43:39.393523-04:00** **

bought 1000 shares of SNAP at 53.  Im up 450 bucks already lol.  Crazy to think that's basically some people's weekly wage.
ad spending is highly correlated across SNAP GOOG FB
Who's eating mangos tomorrow?
!banbet SPY $480 2w 

p.s. Bears absolutely almost as retarded as visual mod.
I‚Äôm hoping for a huge bloodbath all across the board tomorrow and VIX spunking up to 20
Did a boomer move and bought some FB shares. SNAP never made money while FB prints money
Mango-Man Social will sidestep Apple app store revenue woes by getting de-listed from the app store asap. 4D CHESS

I need HCA to have a good earnings report.
Tech is doing just fine
Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

I was researching the cost of building a steel barn and shit is crazy expensive with a long backorder, thats my only DD. You?
Spy lost all its gains from today in 45 minutes.
Pretty sure that‚Äôs lights out guys I can‚Äôt remember the last time I saw an AH sell off like this
God damn $SNAP lmao
Maybe you should try building a social network away from Reddit and other Big Tech where you can freely talk about social networks that are away from Reddit and Big Tech.
The fact that SNAP is ruining everyone that was just playing SPY is maddening. Fuck social media.
Facebook stays catching these Ls
No shit. About ready to go cash gang.
lmao i saw a few retards buying SNAP calls EOD. come out and reveal yourself
Snap missed on earnings
AMD back to ATH.  Sooner than expected.

Should‚Äôve bought that dip at $100‚Ä¶
Go fuck yourself u bitter ho, wasn't talking to your ass

 remember, if vertical lines and out of nowhere gaps are inconsequential on the way up, it will be a scary ride down ‚Äã
GOOG or GOOGL?
I‚Äôm hoping intel‚Äôs current price keeps or drops further. Bought my puts on Monday for tomorrow and next week. Gonna see if I‚Äôm able to avoid iv crush or get dp‚Äôd by iv crush and theta üòÇ. 

Also bought some amd calls to go for that double whammy

**thanks for the reassurance boys!!
Congrats on being a full retard. How much rock did you smoke today?
They both make money through advertising... TWTR is also down
She‚Äôs definitely the dungeon in the closet type
Spy returned all gains, cant wait for my red calls tomorrow üòÅ
Op there goes gravity
Man that sure sucks üòíüòíüòí
This is also assuming that those same users won‚Äôt just stay on Twitter and Facebook while using it.

I mean Parler users probably didn‚Äôt delete their Facebooks and Twitters.
Oops their goes gravity
Rip to those in snap, goog &amp; fb
LMFAOOOOOO thanks dawg
This lol. Snap was dying 4 years ago let alone today.
Glad I paid for December calls. But holy shit my heart.

Hands up if you got your dick Snapped off

Where were you when social media died?
Wtf happened after hours lol
Looks like my 450$ spy puts have some hope
Snap had that earnings beat 3 months ago where it jumped 40%.It's no surprise it was trading at a level way to high.  Expectations were overblown.
Snap still overvalued at 50s 

Should be teens. Like it‚Äôs user base. Fucking clown ass company
Big math guy I see. Clearly in the right spot.
Why is TQQQ dumping AH?
Spy normally after a dip like this there is a dead cat bounce at this point this is illegal
pay someone to take them off your hands
Did u say that for the last 4 ER?
Why is pypl being taken down with snap..? Do these retarded fucking boomers realize they‚Äôre not associated

Do we really want a metaverse, feels like were already in one.
I lost 1600 because I paperhanded FB yolo calls, but luckily I paperhanded FB yolo calls
Hopefully my 1 amd call option can make up for my 3 Intel call options.
Social media stocks wrecked.. except for dear leader mango's social media stock! rotation into it..! needs a 0.5 trillion* market valuation
There‚Äôs hope for my $450 puts yet
Snap and Facebook are the brand new Myspace.
The silver lining about being long on intel today is that it's not snap.
I was kicking myself all day for getting rid of my 10/22 335 FB calls too early
SNAP snapped.
Drill team six also doing a number on ROKU. AH
Do they ever make money?
AAPL with their new data privacy on iPhone
Not sure I understand the logic here either. Knee jerk
Glad I bought a spy put before close but I couldn‚Äôt sell my call like a dunce
I would have felt so smug selling options with the IV as high as it was and gotten totally drilled.

Don't fuck with earnings honestly
I have CSPs that I'll need to roll out tomorrow. Hopefully they explain on the call how they're going to ramp up monetization of their growing user base and SNAP will run right back up to ATH by open.
I'm still butthurt about my 2k loss last year on snap 18p - fuck that valueless company

What is going on with SNAP is a gigantic overreaction and when the markets open tomorrow SNAP will be higher then when it closed
Of all the times not to go full gay bear on snap
Volume and open interest on SNAP puts was huge; going to be a lot of 20-50 baggers in there... wow.

60 put had 7k open interest with 9k volume just as an example, and that's a 30x right now.

I cannot believe my calls are fucked because of SNAPCHAT

Anyone thinking of a YOLO on $FSLY Fastly before earnings?

You're cool, don't come to the market tomorrow

How the hell did FB dump so hard just on news on SNAP??
I know I'm still fucked tomorrow because of the collateral damage to the market, but damn I'm glad I avoided the names drilling bigly right now. Was this close to loading up on FB calls a couple days ago.
So buy em all
Can‚Äôt get them yet, otherwise yeah
I'm surprise that it hadn't slow down the last few days with the drop in TLT. I thought high rates means those small companies can't borrow as much.
I swear I saw someone warning people here 2 weeks ago
Hate to say it but I think SPY is going to have a good size pull back next week‚Ä¶..

SNAP earning call: So we made negative money. Actually, less than that.
Ha ha SNAP, delicious Portillo's italian beef sandwiches are impervious to your implosion

Im like 1000% sure the things that just hard dumped are going to blast off in PM tomorrow, and be back to average by open

Bad earnings
Lmao. AMZN sell off then they realize it doesn't run on ads and it bounce right back up. Foolish algos!
SPY is way oversold
Dumb ass bulls are about to get gaped so hard tomorrow and everyone else is going to kick back and enjoy y‚Äôall‚Äôs pain and suffering. I‚Äôm a going to hard? Of course not just look at their comments over the last few days and realize it couldn‚Äôt happen to a more deserving group of suckas.
guys dont worry its just top officials cashing out. no need to alarm you. keep buying that dip
Since when did fundamentals matter with SNAP? I thought the whole point was to burn through money indefinitely‚Ä¶
Both pins and pypl are dying togheter. Love jf

used 2 day trades this week pulling $1,500 profit in TSLA calls, shouldve held and i'd be up another $1,800
That‚Äôs goals cause you have to be that big for anybody to care
I have 50k in Mango Man MAGA stock at $12 and I'm holding. Last time I thought people were fucking morons for buying GME at $60 they made almost 1,000%. This time I'm trading like a fucking idiot too.
Increased testosterone level
Or how many people don't know how effective they are at deterring ads. If the company doesn't report viewed time to the advertiser the advertisrr doesn't pay them thats how it works
WTF SNAP?!?!
Technically only losing 4k if they stay at this price when my contracts expire , I can always sell CC to hopefully get back up to what I lost
Just checked Elon‚Äôs Twitter, seems to be back to his old meme lord self, I guess grimes was the one keeping the beast chained up

this whole week was all green because bill hwang was buying
INTC needs to go under $50, so those .08 puts that I bought can print
This FUD has been going on for 3 weeks
Wouldn't be. I work in advertising and FB is shitting the bed. IOS 14 fucked them, their ads don't work anymore.
Bitch what!?
I haven't finished it
SNAP is such a overvalued stock that it deserves to die.

well RTY may run as it looks we're in a high inflation high demand anyway kind of environment

I just can‚Äôt get behind them, I feel like the CPU market gap is just going to widen. Too little too late ya know, and what then? INTC designs and fabricates all their chips in house. If that business goes under, they‚Äôre done. Just a sad story of getting complacent

Yeah. I'm very confident that we will be in green by end of year. People are overreacting over pins acquition. I consider it an x mas gift. ü§£
lol wait till morning
I don‚Äôt care about the platform itself. I am just thinking out loud about the price action of FB today. However, it‚Äôs 100% due to snap miss not due to ‚ÄúQanonbook‚Äù or whatever that crap is gonna be called lol
Hope either you or the calls were naked üëÄ
People are selling the news, pick up a few calls tomorrow that expire a few weeks out and you‚Äôll make money as people buy back in. Happens like clockwork.

SNAP that positive market sentiment right in half huh
AMD AMD Sue bae &gt; INTC
It's a selloff!
Same. Was too busy playing Tesla after the pump today and all it did was trade sideways after the pump. Lol.
Finna see it go back to single digits
please tell me you at least bought them dated at least a month out

Thanos just SNAPed his fingers
Losing market share to AMD has been the INTC earnings trend for like the past year and a half
Market got spooked but it‚Äôs easily bouncing back. Skittish cats.
i bought 880s and got out real nice too. lol we will see how the market is tomorrow. i think we should be red..
No need.  SNAP is doing fine deleting itself.
Means mooning confirmed.
Snap didn't moves bigtech. Apple's change to privacy did.
All the companies doing ads are dropping. Snap said Apple privacy policies are hurting them

Bye spy
It amazes me how many people don‚Äôt have any of that. Especially tablets and kids using stuff.
I would like for INTC to stop drilling please. Thank You.
That red dildo after hours on TQQQ gave me AIDs
Tapering....
SPY dumping on that fake pump. if we open above 453 i'm getting puts
Holy FUCK Snap LMAOO
The CEO sold some stonks and made it go down big number
Lotto ticket
Oh..
Snap going to moon tmrrw
I had call FDs lmfao
QQQ gave back everything, red now lmao

Even Goole üòÇ
Don‚Äôt forget evergrande could officially default on 10/23/2021 weee
They are paying $400k for shit tier new grads flexing their overvalued RSUs
Yes, you can trust them.
Grossly overvalued given how much market share they are losing to tik tok etc, just my opinion.
I sold mine at noon‚Ä¶before the run up haha now look at it. Lol nice move dude.
...rotations out of tech last about 3 days;  ...out of big tech maybe;  hopefully Facebook will go bankrupt.
Rip
64 bit cpus.  You aren‚Äôt as old as me.  I‚Äôm talking Pentium 75mghz days
Nicely done
Bro I need $200 for rent
The warrants went up 2000% today... absolutely insane.
I don‚Äôt expect it to be as popular as twitter or fb but it could create a significant fracture‚Ä¶parler was able to get millions of users within days. Don‚Äôt underestimate cults.
Bad earnings
Depends on what you see as missing out.....you made money on the way up....I am making money on the way down.

Winners winners chicken dinners
Buy the dip on INTC? Honestly, earnings didn't seem awful.
Hopped out of MSFT calls, snagged some BABA at EOD.

Time will tell whether I am a retard or a retard savant.
I gotta go to a casino just to cool down from day trading these 1dte's
Trump Tech
Right now is when INTC is free money. iykyk
Vpns ad block etc etc etc. Ad revenue isn't enough anymore
Rip
Anyone have FDs on SNAP puts?
If insider selling is the reason SNAP, FB are going down then are we gonna see shorting vs WSB folks?
Lol...buy the upcoming dip....
#Ban Bet Won
---

/u/Capasian (2/0) made a bet that INTC would go to 52.57 when it was 55.34 and it did, congrats autist.
Why is all Big tech crashing cos of SNAP?
First few minutes of AH at time of comment it looked like it was cliff diving a bit. Glad it didn't!
FBs sudden shift to the metaverse was the telltale. Kinda missed it too though.
Yeah I did the pricing. $1000 bucks into $60 puts would be 50k if the stock opens at 55 tomorrow.
Smarter people were just buying snap puts.
Spy with the fake and gay afterhours dip. Biden will save the day.
that timeline where snap fucking chat moves big tech
Leverage my SPY calls with 0DTE 357 calls , keeping the universe balanced
And snap and everything is going down is because üüß is taking over. It‚Äôs a $450 stock
Oof That U turn on spy. Bulls got hard baited.
sam retardants
Earnings season is going great, guys ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Lol
That conference where he had a bunch of ceos show up to pump on live tv lmao
Now the history books will no longer be able to report, "The Fed Chairmen sold their personal stocks at the absolute top in September 2021, ending the 150-year bull run of stocks in the United States of America."
Catherine Woods probably bought SNAP at the top
Pretty sure it's still news even if people don't like it ü§£
No you‚Äôre good
I‚Äôm glad people are making money but ‚Äútruth‚Äù social?? Really?
Well I‚Äôm glad I got some today could still be some excitement Monday too before Tuesday‚Äôs earnings
I am straight up not having a good time. I was thinking about $65's cause of their ridiculously unrealistic gain from last ER and I hate social media but I didn't do it cause I was too focused on strangling SPY for tomrrow. FML
King ü§¥
Is the 10yr yield killing tech
Well pretty happy I sold far otm calls to idiots here today
LMAO I bought a snap 63p for $25 today hoping to gain like 5% on IV with the intentions of selling at close. Forgot to sell because I was busy at work. First time I‚Äôve been happy to be at work for a minute haha
SNAP is the canary.
Lmfao get em visual mod.
Easy after it drops , You post about before close of market ü§°
fucked harder than your wife by her bf
The beginning of the taper....
QQQ already reversed all today‚Äôs gains
just the federal reserve, not congress
What on earth has happened to SNAP after hours
went 4x on margin for SNAP at 53.8. patiently waiting for 60 to hit and then im exiting my position
I just wished that shit into existence so my puts don‚Äôt expire worthless!
Still not sure why AMZN cares. Twitch? AWS?
what were your positions?
Don‚Äôt be scared Chipotle. It‚Äôs okay to go up more than that‚Ä¶.
INTC results look okay from a top-line perspective, but their cloud relative market share loss to AMD/Arm looks a bit steeper than expected.  And they're saying margins will be down substantially in Q4.

That explains the selloff here imo.
Or the gain porn
Two things before VisualMod bends me over like Snap did to my FB calls.

1) üêª r Fuk &amp; üåà
2) is 1, but with üòÇüòÇüòÇ added
Only one $73 expiring next week, rip
Lol Qqq went red
i sold my $875c i bought after open for 150%. the jumped back in mid day expecting a pump. smh
Gay ass bulls gonna buy the dip
Snapchat is dumb and the stock sucks too.
I would assume what ever is going to be discussed in the earnings call is dragging it down. Still though, losing a quarter of valuation is... excessive to say the least
Loling at snap employees who were flexing their RSUs. get fucked
We‚Äôll played. The weekend is yours.
[deleted]
So pretty much, less advertisement for the internet companies. Bad outlook. Rotation out of tech And into value. First I thought we could expect that Q1 2022. But maybe we‚Äôre seeing it faster
I am still bullish on FB.. invested &gt; $200k .. just lost $14k value but it‚Äôs gradually getting back. The damn AI dumped SNAP and caused ripple effects.
Account will be 100% diversified with SNAP straight from his credit card.
No you‚Äôre good
The bubble may have popped ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
TQQQ
Lmao u r so fucked üòÇ
where's that guy that recommended a straddle on SNAP, just wanna sat that I should have listened
SPY is looking like TSLA yesterday AH
News is bad.
BTW as an update on today's gap fills since I got the same comment about how I'm gonna lose money off them lol /u/Perfectly_Splendid89

TSLA 10/22 865c -&gt; I wait 5 minutes before I do a gap fill play just to let the market bottom/top out. TSLA blew through the gap in 2 minutes. If you bought those calls at open and held for maybe 30 minutes you would have turned $450 to $2k or so

SPY 10/22 452.50c -&gt; Gap filled but call value  barely budged, break even trade here

MRNA 10/22 332.50p -&gt; Gap partially filled at 10am, +$100 if you exited there

CROX 10/19 140p -&gt; Gap also partially filled (was only expecting a partial fill anyways). Put went from $400 to $500 by 10am, and $600 at 11:30am.
F
I bought 1 call and 2 puts as a hedge on SNAP. Luckily it went with the 2 puts lol
&gt; What the fuck are you talking about?
Ur a day late
Win or lose, bigly
With that after hours movement the day is looking flatter than u/cashflow_‚Äôs ass
It‚Äôs a one way ticket to the homeless village
Tesla loves to pump when everything else is red.
Rotation into TRUTH
Anyone who owns snap puts is now rich lmao
Smart people were buying FB puts ahead of SNAPs earnings. Facts!
Lol what‚Äôs with this AH selloff
The tech is the least of the concerns. But it‚Äôs gonna be a a toxic echo chamber for some very far right ppl. And I am a Trump supporter. However, I would say pretty much the same if AOC decided to launch her own woke social media platform lol.
This is the crash I was talking about üëÅüëÑüëÅ
AUD is worthless. It‚Äôs not an even comparison idiot
Is my SNAP 65c 10/22 fucked?
Lol FB... lol SNAP... Why Apple is not mooning then?
Fucking pissed man. Getting bear blood and tears all over my new suede kicks. Get ahold of yourself you degenerates.
Stop talking about snap.. it‚Äôs a retarded dumb company that‚Äôs never been good and has never made a penny.. if you bought it I‚Äôm sorry for your loss.
Intel dropping like the Irish during the great potato famine
Could‚Ä¶ but not likely. Like think about the fact that FB and Twitter are both global in their user outreach.

Why would global users even want to bother with whatever will come out with Trump or otherwise?

I mean.. I rode the way up and I‚Äôm up 150%, but I have no real faith in that thing succeeding. It very existence is politically tainted, and I doubt independents will even bother.

SNAP is a GYNA stock
That just means you're getting old, plenty of young people use Snapchat.
While all social media stocks are down like double digits, TRUTH is still UP 3% WTF
What‚Äôs SPY dumping on?
INTC shitting the bed for earnings is the freest money on the market
Why the fuck would you be in fb right now? That shit is definitely going down for a while.
Like a Grizzly got out of his cage at the zoo.
The upper-middle class in Australia is a lot richer than the upper-middle class in America.   How do they do that!??
Not really. AMD came up with the concept of multiple cores, and they also came up with the 64 bits CPUs. Back in the day AMD was also a gamer favourite with their 3dNow!. INTC just followed them tech-wise and had the advantage of scaling better and benefiting from a massive amount of capital + OEM contracts.
I think it's cloud share loss to AMD/Arm CPUs looks a bit steeper than expected.

And they're saying margins will be down substantially in Q4.
I've done no research at all, but I jumped in at $55.
Absolutely. It's still at the point where it has to be marketed in a very specific way.
Did they give bearish outlook?
congrats you can retire now
Further out, was too nervous, but I'm suddenly violently in the money, so I got that going for me.
Spy puts and
Didi calls at  close.

Spy  calls tomorrow and didi puts.
Ford has been my best performance pickup this month. Loving its growth
DIA looking ok though
I don't get it either. The numbers for earnings were fine but they said something about some apple hurting their ad revenue? Maybe they meant new apple policies will hurt future ad revenue? Even though their revenue for q3 was actually fine? I don't get it
True statement. It's a burrito Jody, not a fucking volleyball.

What asshole is dumping their entire hedge portfolio right now lol. Nothing is having fun after hours.
Lol that new social media spac gonna get so much wsb hype
Still buying calls tomorrow. I'm addicted IDGAF
Nah, it's AAPL's fault
Gonna be shitshow
INTC and WHR are like thank goodness SNAP is taking up all the attention
Tech is hotter than a pistol!

Should we buy more qqq tomorrow comrades?
It‚Äôll be back up before open
Would be some wild stuff if SNAP (of all things) is the canary in the coal mine

Seems like a trap
About fucking time policy makers are banned from the stock market sheesh
imagine thinking investing in snapchat was ever a good idea.
SNAP is like when Naruto died in Boruto

Yall look so goofy and pathetic when the market shits on you.
Ok earnings almost over and correction coming back on the table?

This would be that crash I was talking about
$74 snap puts let goooo
INTL fucking my ass today, granted I have shares so that ass fucking is lubbed up still doesn't feel too good.
Holy shit shouldn‚Äôt have bought my AMD 115 put.

Glad I‚Äôm a shareholder at least
What happened to Snap? CEO killed somebody or what?
Ads
SNAP taking down the whole Nasdaq
Zuck‚Äôs ‚ÄúMetaverse‚Äù idea. 

Pretty much data and tech focusing on IoT and creating ubiquitous devices that are all connected in every facet of daily life.

FB owns a *massive* amount of subsidiary companies at this point.
And run by a bunch of boomers that know fuck all about tech
Guidance is horrible
when its a penny stock.

And I thought INTC was a piece of shit
FB be like awe fuck we got the same problem SNAP
Damn shit is collapsing
t'was a joke sir
INTC üò∂

SNAP üòÇ
SNAP broke all of tech.
If you are surprised by $SNAP, just ask yourself: does anyone you know still use Snapchat?
Apple new privacy settings messed up with SNAP revenues. It will defined impact FB too.
Let's see SPY go to 451 before open tomorrow. Would make an easy buy into calls again for the run up to its ATH.
well PLTR and TSLA are barely down at least
SNAP

$0.17 EPS vs -0.0975 Expected

$1.07B vs $1.1b Expected
So AAPL privacy gonna hurt business. TWTR, PINS puts here we come
[deleted]
It be will be bought by 8pm.
Wuuut? When it jumped from 20‚Äôs to 40‚Äôs last year it was like 50% of the options activity that week. Where the fuck have you been?
Lol look what happens when you don‚Äôt share information and apple keeps it for themselves    
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ditto :/
&gt; I am not sure. I don't follow stocks like that
It went down by 1 buck. It will recover tomorrow pm.

SPwhy?

SNAP: drops on earnings

AMZN and GOOG: "It appears we are now fraudulent"
It‚Äôs positive earning still people freaking out.
I‚Äôm getting old.  I remember when Intel was unstoppable and AMD was some cheap second grade sht
Go make your own sub then if you want to talk about it. Rules are rules bud, stop being a snowflake
DIS like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little tech, I‚Äôll just drop a little. Ok?‚Äù
SNAP is cuckolding in the corner
why did google shit itsself
Revenue miss but probably some fundamentals getting fucked for the earnings call
i almost bought 15k worth lol glad i didn‚Äôt
üò§
I can't wait to see the SNAP loss porn ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

SNAP earnings
I remember that Saudi pump from like $7 to $13 or some shit
Did SNAP numbers even come out?
Amd and nvidia are watching the show lol.
man i get up at 3:45 to make sure my overnights dont fuck me and sometimes i just pass out lol
I guess spy will take a bigger dump than me the morning after a hot curry üôà

Downvote the truth I see , Feeling good about your calls ü§°ü¶ß
tbh buy the dip on FB, GOOG, TWTR. These companies are smart enough to know how to navigate around iOS privacy issues
SNAP
Hello Robinhood customer service? I‚Äôd like a refund on my 40 snap 80c that‚Äôs I purchased today.
Someone going to post 0dte SNAP puts gain turning $500 into 5 figures
Anybody else feel like the fact that BITO exists is a bear argument for the underlying? The asset is so hard to deal with it needs to be double wrapped as an ETF full of futures contracts in order to be a viable asset for regular people.
WTF up with INTC?

Beat earnings by 54% missed revenue by less than 1% and yoy revenue down slightly. Drilling a hole to the earths core right now.
LFGGG!!!
IBM Watson is garbage 

No wonder its down 10%
Time to load up Google
Mine expires April 2022. But expecting at least a 20% drop.
My favorite part is them saying the $3.5trillion(now $1.7trillion) wil cost $0. Like bitch, we see the price tag.
i literally just bought in on some fb a few weeks ago in my roth, had to frantically buy some more which, I love you chucky schwab, but that shit is brutal to navigate rapidly
Someone missed earnings. Panic, sell everything type of move
Probably bounce back a lot in the morning
Dude loved to rally the market. 

Market is a little red and he‚Äôd tweet about how close a trade deal was or something.

My non tech stock that doesn‚Äôt rely on ads just dropped. Makes total sense
apple privacy hurting their ad rev
RISE SNAP. THETA GANG IS HERE.
Snap earnings got fucked on ad revenue due to Apple.  Every other company reliant on ad revenue got taken down with it
Why big tech dropping?
Snap crushed earnings tho‚Ä¶?
Snap earnings are terrible, other socials followed suit
1/0 retards. Of course AMD would go to 120 on INTC‚Äôs shitty earnings.
$60p were $0.11 at close. They‚Äôll print hard.

I loaded up on snap when it hit -30%
At a glance I saw increased rev by 56% yoy, daily users increased 23% yoy, net loss improved, adjusted ebitda up 209% compared to last year.

So how do you see that in a quick summary and explain it being down 30%
SNAP killed them
Hoping FB stays around $320ish until market open tomorrow so I can grab some calls.
Or yenno you could look at the cost of the options and figure out that your comment is retarded.
What happened to INTC?
Google literally just killed every cent I made this week. Fuck stocks man.
460 you crazy!
SNAP reported that Apple's privacy changes hurt their ad business.
Lmao yeah? This is trumps doing?
Makes no sense‚Ä¶ fb and snap shoudlnt br correlated
yeah i should‚Äôve dumped these TSLA $900 fds
I did too; only saving grace is I pushed my calls out to 11/26. Still going to be down like 40% over this shit.
Nasdaq will shit the bed tomorrow for sure
Trump social media is no news. Imagine the worst antivax groups on FB, so it‚Äôs gonna be pretty much like that, just worse since there will probably be no moderation. 4chan for the hillbillies. 

And the snap rev miss is nothing for FB. Snap is crap, FB is everywhere - it‚Äôs the way (unfortunately) society interacts now.
PYPL, now would be a great time to rethink buying PINS after seeing what's going on with SNAP/FB/TWTR.
SNAP is falling ‚Ä¶ at what price i should buy ?
its only a 23% drop for SNAP
&gt; Intel is a master of the art of making shit that doesn't work.
Uhhhhh what?
Well that does make me feel slightly better. I'm still deep in the hole buying ROKU in the 400s like a dumb.
Apparently my "investment" in SNAP is not the one way ticket to Tendie Town I envisioned. Fuck.
INTC please keep drillin baby
Earnings were shit
Take one look at the snap story section and you know why this shits down 25%. We deserved
Baffles me. The one in our city had to shut down because it wasn‚Äôt getting enough business. ü§∑
keep telling yourself that's why. It's unacceptable. Most traded stock on Fidelity today and we can't fucking discuss it
Sympathy selloff because of Snap idk
$LLKKF has been good to me.
Yo they got C00KED
What‚Äôs the deal with Intel?  Looks like a big EPS beat‚Ä¶
Lmfaoooooooi
Are you serious? That's not what it means. Snap died because iPhone privacy changes affect their revenue. These privacy changes are expected to similarly impact all the social media stocks (which is why they're all down)
Sell the news. You have puts now or pay high IV tomm morn
What happened with FB and GOOG?
Plans:

Buy SNAP at $30

Buy INTC at $25

Buy CLF at $5-10

Buy FB at $100
Every single social media platform will have their servers simultaneously combust leaving only the Don‚Äôs platform to rule the interwebs.
SNAP is a $25 stock at most. Good. It was trading at 15-18 pre-pandemic
Fb &amp; snap were sacrificed so üüß could rise
This guy voted for biden
Get this political shit outta here fool
Awww yeahhh still gonna eat tha booty tho üòú
This dip on snap is not gonna survive until tomorrow.
Fuck Tim Cuck
Panic get ready for it. Everyboomer and their mom is going to be exiting social media and tech cause they can't separate the two
FUCK YOU SNAP YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!!!!
I'd assume reaction to SNAP dying. TWTR is also tanking
SNAP you better stay down!!
Lmao agreed, they‚Äôre gonna print, a 58 strike put was like 6 cents. Tmr it‚Äôll be closer to $2 making it a x20 gain
This snap shit makes no sense
See you in another life, brother
Tomm? It‚Äôs happening now. People will start buying.
Yeah it‚Äôs like that on purpose, it represents the cost of getting double meat on a burrito now.
10/22 puts are up 300%.
snap gonna have a wikipedia style donation pop up when you send that dick pic
FB down 6% because of SNAP earnings LMAO. SNAP finna cause the next Tech crash
Ty for the heads up!
For real, what sent every social media platform to the shadow realm AH? Did they accidentally ban themselves?

I, for one, was surprised to learn that SNAP is the backbone of the US economy.

The play was to buy them today because everyone knew INTC was going to take a shit on earnings.
I think it kinda got short squeezed.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Pour one out for the homies who bought SNAP calls üç∫
Lmao who the fuck is gonna use that shitty social media? Only Ya'llQueda and the Talibangelists to spread QAnon shit and plan more terrorist attacks.

LMAOOO JUST LOADED UP ON $FB TO THE TITS!

Don‚Äôt cluck the Duck ü¶Ü
I could have bought at 6 when WSB was unknown sub and everyone was hoping for it to go bankrupt until the Saudis bought a bunch of it
So, Tim Cook basically controls tech earnings lmao.
ü•≠ cucked zucc üò≥
If it's not a social media platform, what is it? What are they rebranding to?
Weeklies?
#FUCK AAPL
Jesus even google down 3% . I knew that apocalypse is caused by SNAP
Maybe fb is dying. Zuck was talking about a name change a few days ago.

Bets on destroying fb and zuck joining üçä for a full media take over?
TrumpBook about to be a reboot of 8chan.
$fb dip looking tasty!!
how  can I buy mango
Snap should be at $25
Basically
For sure, I think the action right now probably helps looking at the tech names all stumbling hard post-market.  SNAP, INTC, GOOG, FB, TWTR, etc.

Any rotation out of big cap tech would probably be to small cap growth/value.

Key right now just looks like even if see a SPY/QQQ dip, if IWM ignores it or dips much less.
It‚Äôs moving past a key point of resistance.
ü•≠spac will be the only social media stock up tmrw oh how the tables have turned
These gap fills are going to be sweet

SNAP 10/22 55c or 60c

INTC 10/22 55c

Waiting for a CLF play too
&gt; Literally impossible unless you got 25-50 billion to burn like musk or bezos

I think you could accomplish it with less than that. Although my comment was more about culture than logistics.
Just buy calls dummy

FUCK SNAP. The only time I got calls for ER!!!
SNAP dead
What‚Äôre y‚Äôall‚Äôs predictions on AMZN tomorrow?
Cash secured , regardless say hello to the new snap bag holder lmao
Lost was such a good damn show. Too bad for the shitty final seasons and poor resolution quality.
I wouldn‚Äôt of chosen it for my rug pull bingo catalyst
Deleted my put limit sales lol LFG
It‚Äôs always dawnest before the dark
And I still can‚Äôt get a fucking burrito properly rolled
Think about all the personal data he can use for campaigning and mailers. It's a gold mine! Also maybe a little FBI honeypot.
Wait this is all because of SNAP and Apple privacy tracking ban?
Choo Choo....
Feel free
 AH wiping out all the gains from power hour
AAPL really said fuck these social media companies
Sector rotation into Tesla tomorrow üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
They needed an excuse people would actually pay attention to is my guess
Bro a whale pumped it by 12% before close. This bitch is going ath tomorrow and over the weekend we drill that's how I see it
Nope. Welcome to a rigged market.
WTF Happend to Snap?

Earnings that bad?
Holy shit snap tanked wtf
Only if they were crazy OTM. I looked at buying a strangle atm expecting a big move either way but figured nah I don't think snap will drop below 66 on earnings. Oof
&gt; Yes, it's the only game in town.
Stocking up on lube now in preparation for all the SNAP loss porn tomorrow
[deleted]
Goog following snap does not really make sense. Both are fueled by ad revenue but one‚Äôs an essential platform for daily life and the other is snapchat.
No options trading yet, but orange man media does have warrants for sale, which are quasi-options
Shes soooooo fine
AMD üî•üî•üî•
TIL chipotle is an 1800 dollar per share stock
SPY 600/650c 1/2024 gonna be a 15 bagger
Hey, where‚Äôs my win? I bet the same thing.
Tempted to YOLO my account on FB calls tomorrow for December.
I need this to happen to AMZN so I can buy golden toilet paper.
Same.  I saw how long it hovered around 245 and thought "Alright we go buy in" lmao
Please! I‚Äôll gladly toss my 10/22 lottos away and cash in on the various puts I‚Äôve been snagging all week.
Easy money
When did SNAP become THE market? People still use that piece of poop?
100 snap puts for $60 strike prices for tomorrow woulda cost $1000 at close. Right now they would be worth $50k overnight. Somebody better post their gains.
Who‚Äôs buying more AMD calls tomorrow?
It‚Äôs a new social media
Even though I just vaporized a significant amount of money I feel good that there were other unexpected victims too.
ü•≠ new social media is enough to kill all other social medias for now I suppose
I was sad for a second with MSFTs rocket but now I feel happy I sold the top today.

Still holding a little
bought puts on coin, hope it dies tomorrow!
Snap earnings so bad that the entire market is tanking
Now that‚Äôs a GUH

Not that -1% bs
Damn! Snap fucking snapped back‚Ä¶ FB is definitely a buy here

/u/dazednconfuse (1/0) made a bet that AMD would go to 120.0 when it was 112.25 and it did, congrats you fuckin nerd.
The rule is in place because of market cap, stop playing dumb.
Social dead, I guess real life interactions now?
I got my first HUGE win with SNAP puts!!! GOD IS GREAT!!!
[deleted]
Here it's your Facebook dip. Grab it and stfu.

Goog -3%!!!
Timmy Apple decided to cuck the entire us stock exchange?

I‚Äôm allergic to ours but I should have bought some sqqq calls
No alternative can survive without big tech and the internet . Literally impossible unless you got 25-50 billion to burn like musk or bezos
There‚Äôs a sub that‚Äôs just as bad that‚Äôs on the front page of Reddit all the time
‚Ä¶
It will go down 50%
Zuck be like why is my net worth tied to this clown company called SNAP
people realizing apple is the big daddy of tech
I mean if it went up 20% instead that would double my entire portfolio
December? Sure maybe

/u/Spitzly (1/0) made a bet that AMD would go to 120.0 when it was 104.75 and it did, congrats retard.
Just because you have caps enabled doesn‚Äôt get you seen more, in fact it just makes you look more stupid, which for you is hard
ID LIKE TO THANK THE ACADEMY
Nice
uhh I'd say -30% is good enough to overcome IV
Anyone with ad revenue getting hit
SNAP LMAOOOOO
Tbh this is a pretty blatant buying opportunity on FB. 

Company is literally rebranding so that people will stop treating it like they‚Äôre just social media and it tanks in concurrence with social media lmao. 

If you‚Äôre investing in Facebook for the Facebook social media platform you‚Äôre brain damaged.

I don‚Äôt like FB for ethical reasons, so I don‚Äôt invest, but I mean come on.

(Really I just don‚Äôt want them to dominate VR because their VR is shit, but realistically they‚Äôre going to.)
Thankfully it's only my back that snapped and not any of my holdings ü§ë
$RKLBüìàüìàüìà
The red wedding and SNAP was the hot ass pregnant girl.
Puts on $455
.4%? literally tiny
FB leaps. Good thing, I was looking for a buying opportunity for my IRA
Imagine not getting rich because you don‚Äôt like mango
It's okay. It's 2021 just admit you like it.  Everybody's doing it now.
So SNAP was the catalyst that crashes the market
Snap swing trade activated
Imagine losing a quarter of your net worth in 10 minutes (SNAP executives)
I just bought up all of the SNAP I could afford - I'm sure it will rebound!
Why FB drop?
Bye bye anus, no lube
Yeah IWM would lead the way higher, and I agree everything looks set up for that. 

But then again, things tend to zig when they look like they're going to zag and the low volume pump the last week looks fake af. 

Tomorrow should be interesting, I'll be watching SPY.
No, they'll absolutely print - are you a 5 iq mongoloid?
The way Tech is looking, you'll get a dip tomorrow if these losses hold.
I've been trying to dig myself out of this hole for months got dammit I'm not losing more but I'm not gaining either. Every time I have a good play that makes me a couple of Gs I have a bad one that wipes it away, or my good play I put in a little capital and the bad one is the one I put in more. I need a winner dammit.
What does snap have to do with Facebook? I'm so lost
Lmaoo remember when snap would fuck puts every earnings? Not this time
25% damn SNAP lost more % in 5 minutes than my üåàüêª ass did all day.
looks like those spy 452p i bought at close will be itm by market open tomorrow
SNAP is blaming AAPL which would hit all of them.
Damn, what happened to the trade desk? Looks like Facebook and snap got hit too.
Juicy dip on FB ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
This AH is awesome...finally on the right side of the Poker Table..
LOL tomorrow will be a bloodbath for tech
Puts on trump's SPAC?
Nobody is talking about what they are gonna do tomorrow?

Puts on every social media

Calls on orange.

duh.
Wtf so now SNAP is causing a market crash bigger than evergrande .am i missing something üò≥
SNAP 10/22 60P will be a 40 bagger tomorrow
There can only be one social media after today. Give rise to trumptopia
College kids in 20 years will be studying about SNAP earnings being the catalyst for the Great Depression 2.0.
Your statement proves you have no idea what you were looking at
SNAP with the Thanos snap
Same same. It is shidding itself AH
Cathie is for sure buying SNAP rn.
Algos going haywire? Intc twtr fb goog droping like rocks
SNAP, FB, TWTR plunging 27%, 7%, and 7% in after hours.
I could‚Äôve told you that Snap was going to fail. I used to be on that shit every single day now I never use it
Lol SNAP FB. Bought some SNAP commons cause no way this lasts. Wish the market was open so I could grab some calls on both
Straight cults.
snap, guh.
INTC Put AMD call checking in ü§ëü§ëü§ë
So we have an Anti-Social Media SPAC moon 400% and other social media stocks -7% avg. Planned af.
Fuck off SNAP, whole market is tanking on your bullshit
Naked?
hell yea I didnt let them track me.
Are we just going to ignore the massive censorship going on in this sub today? It's legitimately insane and unacceptable. Who cares about the idiot involved with it, we're hear to talk about making money
fuck sorry bro.

shit was looking good until SNAP wiped everything with a dose of reality
What competition
And SNAP puts probably didn't even print because earnings meddled with IV
Feeling horrible for only buying 15 snap puts. Oh well at least I have enough intel qqq &amp; spy puts to make up for it. Permabulls new to the market couldn‚Äôt tell the MM‚Äôs where dangling a carrot on a string all day like to trap you in their cage. Couldn‚Äôt happen to a more deserving group of gullible dipshits.
I literally bought fb calls today. Goddamnit. I have the worst fucking luck in the world.
I want to see this too.
I expect people to massively buy the dip tomorrow. Wish I had more buying power
That's the average CFD experience in a nutshell

Holy fuck, SNAP discount of the century. Bought a fuck ton AH.
algos
"bro it just bottomed"
Cautiously optimistic these SPY puts were a smart hedge.....it seemed overextended this week anyways. I'll buy any decent dip tomorrow if things hold, prob Jan 460 Calls
Why were so many ppl in snap wtf lmao
Earnings might tank the market before rates double fuck it.
earnings are out thats why
I just realized how juicy the dips are today. Just like netflix yesterday.
I have fb so it kinda hurts but if it stays like that tomorrow, will double down. Fb and snapchat are uncomparable. Snap is an unprofitable piece of crap that is dying. And while I hate FB, it‚Äôs kinda unimaginable for society to do without it at this point

I was anxious to sell puts but my deposit didn't clear fast enough. Dodged a big bullet there.
Your explanation makes sense, why are you here you seem semi maybe intelligent?
Holy fck SPY is gonna open at like $425 tomorrow
wtf just happened with facebook? Crashed 6%...I panic bought a share
&gt; The world is coming to an end.
Keep crying out to the void, bear
I don't know how to feel about TrumpBook. Historically, most of these companies that market themselves as an "alternative" to Big Tech wind up only attracting the most angry and conspiratorial types.

Look at Parler or Gab or Voat. 

I just want a place where I can call someone the F Slur for liking pineapple on pizza, or make a joke that involves the multiple-pronoun folks without getting deplatformed. Don't need a steamy side of political activism either way, Left or Right.
Imagine having earnings so bad, you make other companies completely drill as well
Where do you think all that money that is dumping out of snap right now is going to go tomorrow? ü•≠ü•≠
What is happening with apple? People rotating into it?
AMD is really my only tech exposure and it's green af ahaha
Probably fallout from the SNAP earnings report.
&gt; Nobody uses that app anyway

That's kind of the problem
lmfao my heaviest loss of this month will be getting assigned on written snap puts. fuck me
Cute. I want you to stop using caps.
Social media stocks down. Looks like a pair trades that went wrong. Someone probably shorted ü•≠s stock. Lol
Would love a circuit breaker tomorrow

Tech bout to get hurt.
They actually opened up at $3.50 but still insane returns
RIP
Just saw a quick summary of Snapchat earnings, looked good at a quick glance so I wonder why its dropping so much? Huge overreaction?
LMAO SNAP single-handedly destroying everything. Butterfly meme: is this a black swan?
Every social media down, Trumps new one coming outs coincidence? I think not
LISTEN EVERYBODY WE HAVE SO MANY STOCKS THAT JUST DUMPED FAR BELOW THERE ACTUALLY VALUE MAKE AN EDUCATED DECISION &amp; BUY SOME FUCKING CALLS

SNAP, INTC, GOOG after hours...
There is no reason to FB go down again., their yearly profit margin 37%, 0 Debt, $65 B cash in hand and they are expecting to beat the earnings next Monday.
I had my finger on SNAP calls at 3:55 but did pull it.

480 EOW
What the FUCK just happened to all social medias
Holy shit snap , sold 65P thinking if it shit the bed it wouldn‚Äôt be that bad lol
The twitter folks truly might be more retarded than us. I still get recommended tweets of retards talking about GME and AMC every single week saying ‚ÄúTHIS IS THE WEEK‚Äù or ‚ÄúHOLD THE LINE‚Äù
Bad earnings. Ceo stepping down.
Add AMZN, GOOG, PYPL to that list
Users leaving SNAP en masse to go use TRUTH!! /s

AMD calls and INTC puts, feelin good
üêªs gonna feast tomorrow
\*not to interrupt all of the SNAP and FB dying posts\*

MVST setup is real nice, could pop one of these days.

Reg shoutout to my boy PSFE, you're recovering real nicely and you'll take us to the promised land one day.
Buying this Facebook dip hard tomorrow, putting in 50k (net worth: 140k). Snap doing bad is good news for FB, means people are spending more time on Insta.
WTF IS HAPPENING WITH FB AND TWITTER
Spy puts will print tomorrow
Snap took everything down with it lmao.
SNAP just got snapped Holy shit üò≥
Fucks wrong with Roku
I was gonna buy calls but switched to INTC credit spreads.
Fuk snap
Got hit hard was looking for it to go up

[deleted]
I really don‚Äôt blame anyone for thinking snap would go up on earnings but holy fuck
It's...it's...beautiful....
FB calls tomorrow tho right :)
Lisa Su needs to come on the AMD conference call next week and be like ‚ÄúFirst off, we are literally eating Intel‚Äôs lunch. ü§´

Wonder how this guy is doing right now?
Rip social media stonks
Geez SNAP just die and leave rest of market alone
I was looking but they were real expensive
social media stocks r fuk.
Tech is dying, INTC, FB, SNAP, PINS....
So who just became a millionaire with puts on ad based companies?
Unfortunately for SNAP the focus is on a small revenue miss, digging a little deeper they narrowed losses from previous quarter by 64% which is kind of a big deal. Either way my singular call is melted.
big tech? more like big gay
I‚Äôm fukin stupid for seeing snap puts and not buying. Fml
RIP To the guy and all his followers that were shilling 95C on Snapchat
Well fuck my $350 04/22 fb call.
Bought snapchat calls at close

Guh
Suddenly owning calls on a plane company that can't get anything right doesn't look so bad as opposed to some of this tech.
i lost everything to snap
Google said "we're changing the focus of our brand to only display feet pics"
Chipotle is now more expensive than the new macbook pro.
Holy fuck FB üò≥
üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Everyone knew snap wouldn‚Äôt be able to compete with mango mans new company, its getting priced in now.
I won't argue against that
#cmon I want a fuckin CIRCUIT BREAKER TOMORROW
Social media investors dead dead
Seriously, anybody know wtf is happening to snap and fb???!!!!!!!!!!!v?????
SNAP down almost 30% ah!
blame SNAP
ü§Ø

Oh snap my face plz üòî
WTF? FB is still beating its expectations and why people freaking out? I am not selling., will buy more
SNAP earnings bruh
probably since SNAP is dumping, similar sectors
Snapchat crushed earnings though
Wow, who else is completely fucked tomorrow
Ouchie
MODS don't want to admit this
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
oh in that case its cool
Bc snap
Theres a new king in social media
Those earning number don‚Äôt justify a -30% Market Cap slice. 

Holy Fuck
Oh SNAP!

O\_O
What the fuck is happening to ROKU üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±

Fuck me!!!!!!!!! Why didn't I drop more puts on SNAP
Too bad you‚Äôre still a tard for trying
Lol
[deleted]
Not telling you
LOL, just looked into all the details about this thing. Bout to be the most epic SPAC dumpster fire yet, and that‚Äôs really saying something
Swung 10/29 $450 SPY puts but took a weak position. Should've gone heavier. 

SNAP going to have people jumping out of windows.
Picked me up 100 SNAP shares for a quick bounce
 Lmao. So snap down. Twitter in the dirt. FB running of a cliff. 

Tomorrow CLF earnings. The real deal. Lourenco Goncalves make me proud tomorrow ü§ô
Following SNAP. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm thoroughly fucked.
lol wtf why is google and facebook going down with snapchat


snapchat has been overtaken by ticktock, no one uses snapchat anymore it's not comparable to google or facebook at all
Imagine the gains of those who rode mango media stock today AND held SNAP puts
It's time to come together.  We are on a moon mission to save our country!
Did any news come out from snap that affect other social media?
Shareholders from google, snap, and Facebook, we welcome you to apple shareholding.
What‚Äôs happening with MSFT
Wtf google dropping 100 plus AH?
Lol SNAP is, was, and always will be trash
üòÇ
Holy SNAP!
I was a little pissed that I didn‚Äôt buy when it was under $320 but I might get a better chance now
where were you when AD TECH GOT DESTROYEDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I was gonna buy FB calls tomorrow but nevermind lol
Someone do a wellness check on FB
AAPL mooning and FB dumpster diving. Love it
Naw SPACs aren't allowed here until post merger.
I'm guessing the SNAP ER isn't going to be a good one?
AMD always been ol reliable
Wish i sold my calls but pdt said nope
Okay all you retards that had SNAP, show yourselves ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Would you rather be P-whipped or D-wac'd?
Lol
SNAP ‚ò†Ô∏è
Lol look at PINS ah. Wtf if pypl is buying then it don‚Äôt matter?
TSLA over $900 EOD tomorrow üòè
SPY $445p 10/27 gonna be a good ass buy after all this earnings hubbub
Jeezus it shit the bed, and twirled the sheets around.
NASDAQ100 +0.62% on the day, huh?
Fuck, I was going to buy $65 puts and didn't pull the trigger because it seemed ridiculous. Damn.
i have never been fucked so hard than i just did by SNAP. RIP my portfolio
Maybe buy some MAT, cuz I‚Äôm a toys r us kid
Is SNAP a sign of things to come for tech?
today is maybe the craziest ah I've ever seen
Who cares about user count if profit is pouring at record pace and ROI for advertisers are great when utilizing Google and/or Facebook. Nothing compares and why advertisers continue to flock on these behemoth platforms 

This FUD is unbelievable
[deleted]
Those are already dead roll to 2023 trust me.
The rules there to protect ppl from pump n dumps i think
I bought qqq puts and VXX calls at close. I might be looking good.
#Mango Unchained
Years from now, people will still talk about Snapchat Friday
That was smart
HOLY FUKKIN SHIT SNAP
[deleted]
Yeah, time to take a visit dude
No because ticker is banned. Figure it out. Mango media.
whats the news on fb dropping? cant find anything
Imagine your company losing almost a third of its value in 20 minutes üíÄ
Rh charts are always so dramatic lol
Crash and GME takes off tomorrow‚Ä¶ this is the world we live in.
Refers to Donald Trump
&gt;Ouch! Snap Inc sees a red cliff on earnings - revenue forecast trailing estimates

Fking Snapchat earnings
Wow  gonna be bagholding some SNAP.
There goes my FB $350 by tomorrow ban bet. Fuck me that thing is dead
RIP SAM hype 2:30-4:15pm
wish i bought SNAP puts, down 30% AH  üòî
[deleted]
SNAP has finally popped.
Now PINS is crashing too. Tech crash tomorrow.
Mood changing here real quick üòÇ
Facebook just absolutely destroyed my portfolio after a good day. Fucked
I think it's mostly SNAP with a little mango man mixed in
&gt; I have no idea.
Jesus Christ SNAP just keeps going. Why can I never be on the right side of a trade???
SNAP LITERALLY BANKRUPTING PPL
Fb and googl will beat
Congrats to whoever bought snap puts
SNAP obliterated
Yeah I think IWM is the key here. Small caps have been consolidating for 8-9 months now and IWM is sitting just above its 200 day moving average.
Looks perfectly set to lead the way higher and most small caps are at better valuations than last year.
gotta love capitalism and FREE, LAISSEZ FAIRE, UNMANIPULATED markets
SNAP effect
Why is FB drilling?
[deleted]
Fuck I sold most my MSFT contracts
Lmao it just got dismal AF in here. Feels good to be AMD gang rn
AMD didn't hear no bell
FB on sale tomorrow
What you got?
[deleted]
Die SNAP die you overvalued piece of shit. I say die!
I only watch Yahoo finance for this Emily girl.
SNAP and INTL fucked us all for tomorrow. You two need to get your shit together.
If you bought SNAP calls you have an obligation to post your loss porn
Puts on Reddit IPO
Rip snap call holders
it's like 100 baggers for SNAP 10/22 55p. Holy fuck! $10000 =&gt; $1000000 just like that
no position (made small time money on puts in the 70s) but damn I'm happy SNAP died.  most overvalued large cap there is
God damn what happened to SNAP? I list 20% of my account in 5 minutes and I only hold shares lmao
Snap taking everyone down with it
Snap should announce a spin-off and a SPAC. That stock is fucked. Lol
Slightly mad now that I didn't throw $100 on some SNAP FD puts.
Just had my FB calls go woorthless omg
And from the ashes a new breed was born. The name was mangotruth
Seems like all social media tickers are getting wrecked!
SNAP's gonna clip DWAC's wings that motherfker
the SPAC is over $1 billion market cap though and it qualifies now
If you have SNAP, then its time to apply for SNAP
Leggo
Holy shit snap shit the bed big.
Welp, my SNAP $65p/$62p Credit spreads are fucked.
Do you know which site you're on?
Fuck that dip spy 457 straight fucking bullish. Get some sleep tonight bulls.
[SNAP chart or my current level of will to live ](https://imgur.com/a/1rD5mV9)
this AH reaction on FB/GOOGL seems excessive but maybe SNAP is confirming ad downfall
Probably good bounce in the morning
Guh
My leaps and shares hope so.
shit i woke up and that mf was $47 so Im just gonna observe from afar
Snap yo dig off ouch

SNAP you beautiful bitch, I accept your new price and think it's finally something fair
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
bro‚Ä¶.? What‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶
Google getting out of the search business?
FB is caving in on itself to create the singularity for the metaverse
HOLY MOTHER OF SNAP
Damn I wish I was able to buy in the AH. Snap is at a huge discount now
Gonna be big red tomorrow lol. FB down 6.5% too.
Stop killing SNAP! He's already dead!!
Funny. Bought at 28 and 32 and 39. Sorry you missed out
Why the fuck did I buy FB at $340
Look how they massacred my SNAP ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Good fucking lord SNAP
To the person who was asking whether they should hold through SNAP earnings earlier‚Ä¶lol
Why the hell is ROKU dipping so hard as if it had its earnings üòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòí
Guh in peace mate. You didnt deserve it this bad
It‚Äôs down $22 lol not 22% 

SNAP is actually down almost 30% though.
Is FB about to announce their re-branded name tomorrow?
[deleted]
snap happened.
Return of Mango
We also saw the single highest volume for a ticker ever
Check Q2 earnings
Like how many times
Snap and fb are connected
[deleted]
bruh my snap call order was for 1.08 and the price went all the way down to 1.10 before going back up. thank jesus that didn't fill holy fuck
Algos dumping snap hard
that would be $22. Not 22%
#HOLY FK SNAP GOT SNAPPED CIRCUIT BREAKER TOMORROW
I BOUGHT SNAP PUTS AT MARKET CLOSE!!!!!
FB a steal rn
Why did tech just crash?
Holy fuck Snap down 25%
Waiting for snap to consolidate then I‚Äôm going all in on calls. $74 price target &amp; a 71% buy lmaooo easy clap
I mean good, but also I held snap for earnings. The world would be a much better place without those three.
Just liquidated all my snap shares in after hours, didn‚Äôt think it would cause it to drop that much, will give you guys heads up next time, my bad.
LMAO SNAPCHAT
AAPL $155c 11/12 is an easy tell right now
Haven‚Äôt had a check up in a while
Holy fuck SNAP put holders about to get lambo money tomorrow
So cool that old social media just went off a cliff together. So normal.
[deleted]
I use it to buy weed
 Bulls about to get there horns ripped out tomorrow. Was there really people who didn‚Äôt have snap and intel puts for earnings?
Good then, glad i sold some stuff before the drop
SNAP getting crushed.
Lol the burrito company killing it. We live in a ü§° world.
I have around 5k just sitting until it becomes withdraw-able, then I have to deposit that money into Fidelity from my bank account. Probably gonna take a week.
Wp
Oh SNAP!  I guess betting on SNAP may have been a bad idea.
Lmaooo. Crash
Well good thing my fb calls don't expire until 2022 April. Jesus
Are there any other examples of stocks dying &gt; 27% on earnings? 

I can remember 10-15% ones. But this is too much.
SNAP getting fooked up!
Anyone else exclusively invest in spy stock and trade in spy options?
**You smell that gentlemen???**

#That' the smell of LOSS PORN in the afternoon
im not looking for changing the trend or something, just a normal correction will do the trick also 4hr divergence is in play!
Facebook wtf man‚Ä¶ dont do me like that
holy shit look at FB/GOOGL AH too

nice job tim apple
Oh snap
I'm  playing TWTR puts next. If SNAP ain't making money ,no one is
Where were you the day social media died?
looks like you are fucked
Facebook snap twitter u guys good?
I revenge trade HD way to often, sometimes it taketh..but today it giveth
Can someone explain ü•≠ meaning pls? I'm drunked retarded and new
I'm a holder, but it always dumps after earnings
nobody:

snap: OH SNAP!
Every social network down Gug.
Holy fuck SNAP just killed my FB account. LMFAO
I randomly decided to sell a $69P on SNAP expiring tomorrow to cash on premiums. Looks like a huge loss incoming. Fml
Sold before close üòÇ
Probably. INTC has some time to catch up with the recent TSMC delays for Ryzen 4, depending on how well Pat can iterate off Alder Lake
SNAP happened
&gt; after
Sry
Rip FB calls
Thats fine and all but would you buy my snake oil?
What the fuck happened to FB after hours?
[deleted]
Fb down 22%  after close

Fuck cuckerberg
Before
Chipotle üöÄüöÄüöÄ
CMG, americas greatest stonk
Lol BIG ‚ÄòOOF‚Äô to FB
Yeah I couldn‚Äôt figure it out. Now that snap is down 26 percent it makes more sense. I think fb is a buy here. Not the same company folks. Tell that to the people selling amd because intel can‚Äôt get their shot together.
Snapchat uterly screwed me
SNAP puts was such an obvious play , you are living in 2015 if you are still using SNAP , everyone uses insta or tiktok. SNAP $60p is 50x bagger just in intrinsic value if the AH price stays
My 10/22 75‚Äôs are fucked now.
God I hate SNAP
I just had to buy SNAP calls...
linked to SNAP
congrats to the snap bers. ya crazy madlads
Ok so is snap gonna snap back? What's going on? Am I an official bagholder?
Snap just crashed; I made a lot of money‚Ä¶
they probably don't have any kind of convincing plan for future revenue growth
Someone sent an unphotoshopped picture of the Kardashians
Social dumping cause of Trumps new platform? wtf bruh
What‚Äôs mango man social media
FB dying as though Trump's social network is gonna destroy it lol

Good INTC is a disgrace to America. Going on 60 Minutes crying and begging bringing dishonor to our great country.
Seriously SNAP is shit tier overvalued app. Fucking algos are dumb
Intel fb and snap just got fucked. Congrats everyone who bought fd puts
Remember the Thanos SNAP? Figured y'all woulda learned smh
SNAP

Closed my FB calls to buy PYPL calls. I was super upset and thought I let go of a winner to buy a loser. Thank fuck I would have been rinsed !!!!
Wow rip snap

Mods just go ahead and ban me. Ain‚Äôt no way my ban bet on SNAP goes through now
well my SNAP FD spread is gonna be worthless but thank god i trimmed it down to like only 1/3 of original position. no harm no foul.
It was just this morning that I mentioned it would be sooooo hilarious if SNAP tanks just because everyone here is buying calls blindly üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I'm gonna be fucked tomorrow.. Fuck fb. Damn
Chased it and I‚Äôm still up a lot. Hopefully dips tomorrow so I can get to a hundo shares with decent cost average
Same, and I‚Äôm banned today lol
I think imma be sick ü§¢ wtf Snap
Stupid people trying to be ‚Äúcontrarian‚Äù
You're committing suicide by bot if you repeat a spam ticker (low cap, SPAC, etc) a bunch of times. It'll get you automatically temporarily banned, so don't be a smoothbrain. Use an emoji or something and don't make trading recommendations if you must comment on it.
I would've been rich if I bought SNAP CB and WHR puts
Jesus fuck my FB call is gonna be dead
[deleted]
All the SPY ATH hype had me forgetting to look into SNAP puts FUCK FUCK FUCK
Wtf happened to PINS? Why the AH dump?
RIP SNAP
I‚Äôm still on robinhood. Stop losses don‚Äôt work on options. I transferred money to tos but still can‚Äôt figure out how to trade options there
Fuck, I totally spaced on Snap earnings
SNAP is ded üíÄüìâüìâ
Godless it‚Äôs not the bug
Render unto SPY
SNAP is so bad it's gonna change its name back to Food Stamps
FB DIP AH!!! QUICK!
Well I guess I‚Äôm gonna make money for once. I bought FB straddles expiring tomorrow
SNAP down 26.6% now. And it is taking brother FB with him.  Lmaooooooooooo
Straight crashing
Lol big F for SNAP
I am sure alot of people in here wouldn't mind puffing up what you are hitting.

Puff alittle more and those bags won't fell as heavy.
guh bought fb dip too early
That's where you're wrong, Visualmod.
&gt; Nah,
Sheesh
Snap and fb mein Gott
Lol that's a 10 banger
damn I kind of feel bad for FB call holders. imagine getting fucked by SNAP like this
Snap
Never doubt the don
holy good god, can somebody explain to me how an EPS beat and slight sales miss...can cause a ~24% crater? Like how can the whole discounted cash flows yadda yadda be that heavily impacted?
[deleted]
Without me, the market is useless. Without the market, I am useless.
Oh snap
Wow guys, would you look at that huge green shrek dildo on SNAP ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

After hours is a bloodbath.
Snap, straddle, pop
No one wants to sell the beautiful spy baby
Snap cock!!
I mean it sure looks fucked
Fuk I called snap put‚Äôs yesterday but I also didn‚Äôt buy
INTC dead. Rip call holders.

Cuz snap
#OHHHHHH SNAP
R.I.P SNAP
Yo FB falling 5% off SNAP's earnings? You gotta be kidding me
Ahhh fuck can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôve done this
Why
Social media is ‚ò†Ô∏è
Well honestly there is Buona beef for better beef sandwiches, 5 guys for better burgers, and even Pops has better hot dogs. I only eat there when people who moved away come back home and have a craving. Their customer service has been getting shitty too.
Oh SNAP, there goes all my profits for the week.
IF YOU'RE NOT BUYING SNAP RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG!

Holy schnike! You get it for a quarter off! YAYAYAYAYAYAAYYAY!

Start setting trailing stop losses, or as I call it, synthetic diamond hands.
I would think a small pullback occurs after the fed announces tapering in the next meeting. Almost like clockwork there‚Äôs been a dip after fed meetings/announcements this year. I also think the inflation trade will continue for some time
My move for tommrow is hoping CLF doesn't rape me but we all know it will

Except it didn‚Äôt though.
These $INTC bags just keep getting heavier GUH
Intel gonna feed my kids for ages to come
Cause Intel sucks
It's fucking flat. These fucks should just admit they need to pivot to e-prostitution like onlyfans
why is SNAP taking so much time with their report?
Why is it seen as unlikely?
I know which one gave it to me too üò°
Hits 55 shortly after open tomorrow. That‚Äôs my bet. Any takers?
What was that eod dump on CLOV
So I guess this is where I give back the entire 26% gain I made on COIN, and an additional 30% making me go from +26% profit to -30% 2 weeks later. Sounds about right.
Intel next Enron btw

Are stocks gonna fall tomorrow then? Because of the fed talk?
10 year pumping along with SPY ATH and 7 straight days of green? This fuckery is rarified.
PYPL looks tasty
Playing $INTC ER is too easy, you buy $AMD calls and $INTC puts. $INTC ER are just another $AMD ER lol (with bad $INTC news being good news for $AMD)
INTC got taken behind the shed, usually bullish for AMD
INTEL (INTC) üòÇüòÇ
To be fair those are all reasons to be bullish

Some stupid 460 calls for next week
I know you got a couple sugar babies you got the bug
$26
holy fuck AMD. is that gonna ride into tomorrow?
Over all, not a bad day.
I have hands made of paper. Bought 180 spy calls expiring tomorrow for .93 and sold at 1.28. Those calls closed at 1.61. Missed out on 5k
It will be a swift recovery, 260 by Friday next week. I put a ban bet on it
AMD fomo before INTC earnings is some 2d chess
Bit of both nowadays, but hopefully INTC incompetency outweighs it
Time to buy more AMD call, boyz.
Actually the pain starts tonight
damn sold nvda way to early
BB...it is still disappointin
AMD calls at close for INTC earnings was my greatest play of the year.
INTC raising 21 EPS and guidance and drilling AH. That‚Äôs about right.
Congrats and fuck you, that's all?
INTC

kekw
Sofi to 23$?

Everything is fine. No need to further tighten your tight butthole flair  


Looks like it's about to bust up out of today's ascending triangle if you ask me. Bullish

Probably. Only because ill be jacked to the tits with puts, and the market gods love to see me squirm

That said, I rolled some profits into a few 455c 1dte lotto tickets, LFG
451 1DTE SPY puts were too cheap to pass up on buying one ü§î

I'm just here for AMD pump tomorrow lmaoo
Strangled the fuck out of some 10/22 SPY ... it's 457, 448, or Wendy's for me boys. Let's ride.
It moves on SNAP earnings which will be released soon.
And I might get Jennifer Lawrence to lick crack of my ass ü§°

$YANG GANG üëäüèª where are you?
Got a clean ATH intraday and close on the S&amp;P500 there at the end.  SPY is a half point below its ATH which likely gets taken out tomorrow.

Small caps look like they're breaking out with the action of the past couple of days, look at Russell 2000/IWM.  If IWM gets above 230, that'd be a breakout for small caps, I think small caps will lead the next leg for S&amp;P 500 to 5000/SPY to 500.

Hard to see any reason to be bearish here, there is likely to be rotation between growth/value and big cap/small cap, but don't see why we'd get any major selldown.

Even interest rates/bond yields aren't that scary and most likely to just see rotation/minor dips.  Market has moved up along with bond yields the past week.

Unless JPow goes with a super fast drawdown of Fed treasury buying, there's nothing else that looks too bad on the horizon; that's probably only uncertain event ahead next few weeks.
TQQQ, expense ratio 1 percent.   

Still, gonna buy as much as I can tomorrow morning.
idk what msft is doing but im fucking in
Soon Biden's infrastructure bill is gonna shrink down to around $10. They keep taking shit out because they can't even get their own party aligned on this shit.
SPX broke ATH , SPY hasn't broken their ATH yet which is 454.05
Looking to sell puts on Portillos or slowly load up. I watched their locations grow in Chicagoland over the years and they're all still packed with drive thru lines around the building every single day from open to close, but I figure it'll take time to expand. Once it does, it's like crack.

Yeah because their guidance will be better
Behr if you‚Äôre not a bull
Why would anyone buy Intel calls. Bad news has been coming out for months now about shortages and how their tech is old and shit.
Just get the off brand thinner from home depot.

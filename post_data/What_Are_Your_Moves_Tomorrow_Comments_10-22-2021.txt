If the stock market is a voting machine in the short term...
I mean trump is blatantly trying to destroy democracy as we know it so…
Yesterday $50+

Today $100+

Next week $500+

Right?
Not a fan of the guy either but it’ll go up again today…it’ll drop hard sometime mid next week. Wouldn’t be surprised if it taps $100-110
When are options available for the 🥭?
Starpenis
We like the stock 🥭😩😩
They are more dedicated than Biden followers.

I wouldn’t be surprised if Elon musk contributes towards the media attention of Donnie social media company… 
Many of us may know Elon and Facebook dude don’t get along well at all and Elon advocates for freedom of speech and also supports the right wing…

Just speculation so don’t downvote me to oblivion
Oh SNAP lmao
NHS are running trials on cimetra as a covid medicine in England 🇬🇧  hearing good things coming Monday morning we will see could be rumours. Do some dd on mgc pharmaceuticals it's not very well exposed but this m*crocap looks juicy not gonna lie. Sitting on a million shares nearly got 30k in it
Found the cultist gargling trumps balls on every comment barely tangibly related the guy on the internet

Fomo from non-active traders starts today. This thing is going over $100
🥭 jits tacked 🥭
Drong way: !banbet Dwac 100 1d
Same thing that always happens... It's BB.
this you Bernie? https://i.redd.it/9lvpe01ain751.jpg
This is the biggliest stonk.  Believe me.  Those losers at Facebook and Twitter are down but I will make WSB great again.  My stonk will print so you can YOLO some real money into SPY 69420 January 2024 calls for my re-election.  Bigly.

That sounded about right for the Mango pitch.
Yolo

Sup retards, i just made some money and wanna pump it into some retarded stock going to the moon. Any options for today or next week?
The opposite of Baldwin is Hairloss

Yup
remember when exxon got kicked out of the dow and just death spiraled for months and greta was talking on tv about shit? i bought the shit out of that dip while also buying tsla. keep your politics out of your trading
lol..  I've been swing trading it all pre-market
No news at all, but somethings changed since the last dip. The bullish spikes like yesterday are enough proof for me, that the next run to 200$ is imminent
I don't see anything out of the ordinary.
Just buy shares
Lol are meme stocks all down 4% because you morons are selling in order to be able to buy mangobook?
Options hasn't even opened yet. His rabid followers are still wait for their paycheck deposit to settle with Fidelity so they can buy. 

This will easily pump over the next couple of weeks. Never doubt the devotion of the MAGA crowd or their willingness to throw money at whatever he's selling.
[deleted]
Cathie buying?? Jkjk
Exactly. Fucking gme, amc, doggy coins, all can sustain ridiculous valuations, because a bunch of idiots believe in it. 

Well guess what. This has the biggest TAM of idiots.

My new ratio is: TAM of idiots/market cap and boy is DWAC undervalued
Uhhh this is a hold till gold
[deleted]
GME right now is in full launchpad mode. The runup from the dip, yesterdays spike to 190$, todays drop, all on no news...it looks mighty ready for the next liftoff
All bideniers gonna short the stock on day one and its gonna backfire so hard when it’s at 80%
Yes, it pumped back up end of month.

Jokes aside this is not GME.  This is cashing in on a MAGA pump and dump.  But dont underestimate how hard the fox crowd can pump.  I think this thing hits 100 before it dumps back to 10
Other SPACs are discussed here - like CLOV
Ape love mango
What the hell happened to BB?
Mango needs a stock split
I bet Donny is scanning this sub tits jacked pussy grabed
They bought collectors coins for trumps failed meeting with Kim jong un…they will buy literally anything. They are the easiest marks on the planet
This one hurts the sold.  Ditched it a few weeks ago
It's yuge. It will generate billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars for everyone at WSB. That's a lot of money. Greatest ever stock.
500b in a week
Think i'm gonna sell half of my shares on a loss, it's normally after that prices go up, then i'll sell the other half and profit? this seems like a good plan.?
or my bunions and Type II diabetes?
Lol on what timeframe?
or "DamagedMitts" fingerless hands?
Orange man options? When commoth tendie man?
The political fighting alone brings so much attention to it. In reality it does have real potential, all emotions aside I’m glad I went in retarded yesterday and made some 💰
Someone posted after hours here.  Thats how I got in at 21.

But yes its a spac and technically against the rules.  Not sure why the mods didnt nuke it to oblivion tbh.
More like 500x tbh
You know “Truth” will get pumped on SNL - to the moon!
Gay
The real fomo starts today. It's not too late. It's going to $100+
Someone convince me mango has more in it I'm scared at this point
like your appendix, horns, and forked tail?
Paper handed my mango shares at $46. Shame on me!
#its a rotation out of the memes and into THE ONE TRUE MEME 🥭
Why?
I just remembered how obsessed they are and have put in couple hundred
1 hour and 9 minutes before I can premarket buy some more mango.
Fidelity is 7.  Mango had plenty of pump in it.
[deleted]
Why do people handicap themselves with those shitty brokers…lol.
for today...  Then it will be back to the good old standards.  :)
Found the 🌈 who is letting his emotions get in the way of making money 🤡🤡🤡
I found once you stop caring about losing money things become much smoother.
Im holding mango right now.  If Obama started a ticker for the Obama News Network you are god damn right I'd go balls deep in it.
Saw it 30% up thought what a joke, saw it 78% said gonna crash anytime now, saw it 150% closed my phone, checked before sleep said what a 🤡  are you no wonder you don't make any money
Ey mang to be our new salutation
Ah ok thanks. Yeah I’m not buying shares on any fuckin spac. No matter how ridiculously talked about it will be
virgin galactic penis
Come monday morning mgc pharmaceuticals will 20 x or more
GME should be a $8 stock, today riding around $183 and people are doubting the Mango stock. Wake up, this MF’r is fueling to launch 🚀.
waiting on the Schwab and RH maniacs that can buy in premarket until 7am EST
yesterday in a discord someone berated me for helping fund a racist narcissist and i smh this guy doesn’t wanna make $
Sheeeeeeeeeeeit
My PINS bags want it
DWAC. This thing is going to 500. Think digital money. Think doggy coin. Everyone looking at MARKET CAP.

If the market is going full retarded you have to go full retarded too. If you only go half retarded you're done for.
Bruh... less than a 2b market cap. Shit is gonna rip bigly.
MANGO is the new FAANG.
Bro trumps cult will buy anything lol they will drive this thing to whatever he tells them to. These people are obsessed with the guy. They’ll give their life savings to him if he asked them
To
Ah right. Yes they have had a wait list for most the year. They do tend to have a decent selection
MAGA 🇺🇸 MAKE ACCOUNTS GREEN AGAIN !
Everyone already bought.
I’m about it
Should have YOLOed popcorn money. Easiest x4 🍿 in your life

Making Media Great Again! And Free speech.
Might as well call this sub mangostreetbets at this point.
Totes. The money has to get parked somewhere. Looks like it’s getting parked in TSLA AAPL and MSFT
I'll send you 1K if this happens and I'm not even joking
fuck off pinterest, paypal doesnt need you
Trump's SPAC.. DWAC..  Careful though..........
Sub rules specifically state no talking about certain things or you get the banhammer.
you make a good point, and have convinced me to put couple hundred in it
never let politics or morality get in the way of making money

personally, i hate weed, i don't like how it makes me feel, i hate that certain friends of mine get stoned out of their minds and annoy me by starting conversations and not finishing them, but fuck it, I'll make money on weed stocks. 

If I was doing my "playing earnings" phase, I'd make money on Haliburton, Starbucks, Twitter, Alex' Jones website, mango bux and/or the failing new york times

i'm only here to get rich. i'll take any motherfucker's money if he's giving it away
That does sound good
Donald somehow making me money again
GME moving more in premarket than it has in months
This guy hates money, am I right guys 🤓
IBM looks really good same with snap. Already way under the MACD
I’m not selling until China invades Taiwan. 😎
For real this is GME January energy
You thought apes were bad here comes the mang gang.
Market cap is still very low. You haven't missed out
People ran out of money or they’re waiting for market open because they can’t buy.
Amen.

Yep 🙌
I’m in here like every fuckin day and have no clue what the shills are talking about with the mango shit.

Lmfao!! This guy is going to be banned
FB is gonna have a baaaaaaaad day
Everyone bought at premarket open
Yesterday was easy mode.  Today might be different
Euphoria? Check.
What’s wrong with you, you are being rational, 😉
Never let your human emotions/feelings get in way of trading. Those are human errors we have built in .
They're already on NBC lmao
More importantly, on a pro-Trump message board, everyone is buying it

These people will NOT sell
Edit: the greatest former US President
FOMO is backing it up. 


Seriously, I don't doubt for a second that this new social media platform will poop out same as GAB and all the others. But after the last five years, I've learned to NEVER bet against the stubborn passion of his congregation. They're all trying to sign up at fidelity and throwing their whole paycheck into this. 

These are the people that bought gold coins commemorating some imagined North Korea peace treaty. Look at how well those shitty MyPillows sell. This is a demo that's just begging for something Trump-related to throw their money at. That alone will keep this pumping for the next few weeks.
It doesn't matter if you're black, white, red, or blue.  The only color that matters is green.
It's not even in its final form!
At this pace 🥭 will have to announce a split soon. 8 month tsla lifecycle in 5 days.
TDS is real.  Triggered shorts adding fuel to the 🔥
No, but I'm going far out puts, not weekly. I'm not a degenerate like most here with weeklies.

Edit - also depends on the Greeks.
I wouldn't worry about it. In 45 minutes pm will be open to more retail traders. 6:30 am ET is the earliest my platform allows
[deleted]
Yeah, that’s what people felt about the 2016 election, and the MF’r is still shaking the system up in 2021.  Haters just can’t shake the man, and that fuels him and the stonk!!!!
Wendy's Penis
Market. Cap.
Too many SJW losers in here right now. We are here to either make money or lose money, nothing in between
Reeeeeeeeee
!banbet DWAC hits 100 today
I mean.. it's not a profitable company already and they expect revenue to slow in the next quarter. I dunno..
That is the hilarious part

People are letting politics prevent them from making money

For example, I'm not super fond of Obama. But if that dude created a media empire today, you bet your ass I'm buying because he has over 50 million people who love him
I’ve just checked and they do. But they also now have WAITLIST for an account, as they are the only ones. Damn.
It's gone up 60% AH.

Today will be another wild day
it was INSANE at the start of PM and then just kind of died
Any of the social media stocks hurt by SNAP shitting the bed.

$FB, $TWTR, $PINS
I’m not really an own the libs type of guy, but it is insane seeing how many comments there are here disparaging 🥭 stock based on 🥭 himself. This thing was obviously getting launched into the stratosphere, and I think it’s hilarious that people let their own feelings about the guy prevent them from making this incredibly easy money. He legit broke people’s brains and it’s incredible to see
LMFAO. this will be irrelevant in less than a month, those bags are gonna be so heavy godspeed retard
f those are good
Nope
Donny if  u r reading this say " clov"
Or below, yeah
Virgin Galactic Penis
I guess I don't really mind that Mango is trying his tiny hands at securities fraud now.  I hope he keeps it up for a while so the pump can continue
Sounds good, lmk
Over 9000
It's a SPAC.
I think it will surprise everyone. Fomo from non-active traders starts today. Lots of people will invest in him as an fu to the other platforms. $100 is not a stretch
Fidelity says I can buy 4am pst
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Mango BlackBerry smoothies are my favorite

The Don actually had some Mango coloured MAGA hat on his website. I think it should be the new uniform. 😂
Let’s hope so lmao
And vix is low. Very low.
Mangos are better than blackberries
You remember GME in February, right?

Oh please don’t say that 😫
What a hypocrite

Work towards my goal of turning 10k into 100k. But will probably turn the 10k into 1k
My sweet sweet BB 😢
I was gonna buy some mangoman but ive decided to just buy popcorn and watch it all play out 🍿
Might be a broker thing.  Fidelity casino doors dont open til 7 for premarket.
Pinky swear?
Bang mango for 100k and ride it to a new Lambo or 3
thank you, let me get “trumps sugar daddy” as flair if I win tho

Spacs arent allowed here
Price target EOD TSLA? It keeps trying to break 900.
He will sell you out like he sold out the country... The cunts been bankrupt 10 times. If youre falling for this scam you probably went trump University
It's pm
People were talking about it here a lot
That may come, but not today
Didn’t t212 have it?
Feel sorry for the dumb fucks who are gonna get left in the dust on this one

Youre not to late bro. That was just day 1.
How the hell do you buy before market? I can't buy till 9am
anyone getting calls on losers like SNAP, IBM, PAYPAPL
I found out about it from the news and made some very nice gains. Was just surprised people weren't talking about it here
I’m not ever going to be bitter that I wasn’t allowed to buy 🥭
I think this has topped a really crappy year. We need Robin Hood, for all its faults, to enter the U.K. market.
Our stock brokers all take so long to add stock, I’ve missed a few good boats.
But this one was a joke. I called 6 new companies at pre market. None of my apps. Pathetic.
I'd use 🥭 and would probably be willing to pay $50/mo or so for a bundle.  Tens of millions like me.
Ask before you pay next time you cheap bastard.
250 bagger!!
yh ik but I still don't understand the thought process of buying an already 300%+ stock with nothing to back it up?
How do you not see that an echo chamber is great for ad income
I feel like fb’s pain is aapl’s gain
and twtr
Of course it will. There is no chance any True American Patriots will be left holding the bag. No way 🥭 would ever scam the people who love him so much.

This is the way to own the libs and the Deep State. 

We like the stock.
People buying into Trump's Spac are out about to learn what it means to be apart of WSB's ... 📉
Memers went to mango. Kinda obvious
Where did all the volume on mango+ go?
what does "planned" even mean lmao just go on Twitter dude
Assuming the future swaps theory is right, SHF are preparing for the rocket ride on 11/23ish.

Im an ape so I'm hodling, but for those who are not of our Way, buy december calls.
Yes $460+ EOD
More.  Can’t hold back 80+ million people who actually like him and his Media Entertainment along with his Great Leadership.
No options available
It’s gonna crash so hard
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/BringBackBrofist** bet **DWAC** goes from **69.48** to **30.0** before **2021-10-22 16:30:58.791680-04:00**
Everyone here is buying the 🥭 today. I'm dumping all my stinker stocks and buying like a mofo. Buy buy buy!!!!
so whats the play on spy? will it break all time high to rally the friday close?
Very few posts about DWAC yesterday. Seems planned. Maybe it was discussed more on Discord?
!banbet DWAC 30 11h
It will crash with fire once it’s clear the product is a joke. Fascist echo chamber and Trump himself has already been hacked and faceraped
Lmao, good luck on this
No
It's a modern family
That'd be like a 250x from here.
Selling out to buy the ONE TRUE MEME
The branding and merchandise alone is going to bring in revenue Bigly!
Probably more.

mango is going to crash lol buy puts
I love how 0 DTE falls on a green AF day
Gainz are fleeting. 

Pussy is overrated.  

Get a dog.
Getting sweet potato fries from a&amp;w and I ask for another sauce after I pay cause they never have enough and this bitch had the audacity to make me
Pay for it. Like wtf not like it effects your pay. Just gimme the sauce
Will mango run up 50x like GME did previously?
AMC and GME go down
🦍not keep both 🍌🥭?
RIOT 0dte is free money today. had a nice dip yesterday and corn is starting off strong today. thank me later
BB already getting annihilated at pre market. For no reason. Again.
Is the Mango company hiring?  I’m ready to start.  I have a Journalism degree.
I don't think you have missed out yet. That was just day 1.
MANGO INSTANTLY TAKES ALL OF FACEBOOK MARKET SHARE .
heard we are getting a new platform that could possibly cover this price action
Mango quarantine thread definitely needed. Lmfao.

The right answer
SPY til I die
SDC is on sale.  Buying more.
Hey CNBC, if you don't wanna cover 🥭, then bye bye 👋
I hope this mango stock gonna shake up the market and everything is gonna moon
With Fox News dads everywhere behind us we can’t be stopped.  Mango to the moon
I am pretty mad that I had to find out about it from Twitter. Fortunately the correlation between being a bear and being a Trump supporter is stronger than ever thanks to 💤👴  being at the wheel, so the permabears/zerohedge-style guys were the source.

But back to the point, I missed out on fat gains because I was too late to hear.
Dwac is at 1.5 bill mkt cap rn. Easily goin to 50 bill

Fuck FB idgaf that some moron commented on some thots post

Fuck TWTR idc if i used a curse word and yes im okay with the tweet

Fuck IG girls dont post enough pics in MFin sandals !!!
Honestly, we were overdue for a correction. 

I’m actually glad there will finally be some dips to buy now.
Ugh, you prude... Pull out or get out (not financial advice)

We gotta make sure as many people like you find out about this stock as possible.
looks like my baba calls are gonna print. hopefully she runs all day for me
looks like it’s still listed , mango doors wide open, just depends how much you wanna pay to get in
We like the stock.
$PHUN 🚀🚀🚀
Your choice but, I believe there is lots of time.
So sad I missed out on mango. Laughed when I saw it up 80% and briefly considered buying. Very poor form. Pls enjoy it for me.
it's been a nailbiter premarket...  trying to swing in and out
You know except literally every outlet has an article about it going up 4 fold yesterday.
Banbet RH halts trading lmao
Suck my mango flavored balls
Buy it now
Just for the record since the corrupt SEC, FBI and CIA don’t like Mango and are watching, I like the Stonk for its products, message and dominance in the Media sector.   Now I’m covered.
definitely don't think it's worth it. even if shit runs like crazy again you can may get like a 30% return if you time top perfectly. but there's a huge chance you'll end up losing half your money. if you want big gains today  just get calls on something else. PINS is looking really good today

edit: lmao this thread just a dumbass echo chamber
What yolo 0dte options today wsb??
Did HCA already do ER? I see it’s down a bit so I assume they did.
Mango mango ah ah ah ah ah

Amen brother
DWAC premarket has old-timey fun feeling memories
I have the same question
Riding into Financial Valhalla on the 🥭 train!
Once this bitch hits 4am I'm buying 

Don't care price 

Ain't waiting for a dip
The $900 ceiling on Tesla is wild
BREAKING: Filing shows Pelosi bought between $1M and $5M of Mango on October 15th.
Your mom's a DWAC
I think it will run until options are available. That’s when the real fireworks start.
This episode taught me that I'll buy Satan's stock if it moons 🤣
Nah, I got flagged with good faith violation. Can only trade with settled funds  for another 2 months
Trump pump got me feeling tingly nostalgia
Can I still hop in on mango? Seems like I’ve missed it
Market will go down and the only best play will be Mango stonk.  Milky Way, here we come.
Won't crash
Fruit. Tastes nice
it seems it won't be this time that I will break even on BB 😞
There's a conspicuous undercoverage of mango 🥭  on financial media.  They can keep this under wraps for long.  When the resnecks from the countryside role in, we're going to Mars.
Dwac
That GME money is sliding into 🥭‘s DM
DWAC
It's the latest sensation sweeping the nation.
All fomo money is moving in to it.
Referring to everything outside the markets
Pretty sad I hear about a lot of the world events from this page lol. I need to get more informed
Does Google stock not trade in premarket? Or is it just today that there’s no movement?
Gme again feellsgood
Next time have better plans.
Imo that ship has sailed, baba gonna go uppies from here. Not sure enough to buy calls tho
 what is mango?
We like the stock 🥭
I cant wait for it to come out that Nancy got in at like 10 bucks.
[deleted]
I think the broker has to have the stock in it's inventory, I'm probably wrong
It was planned
Dwac turned me into a MAGA let's goooo
In theory ya
Should have used a condom
Not an American but watching the political discourse today is some popcorn worthy shit.

That’s said taking politics out of it those are some nice returns on DWAC at launch. I sure as shit ain’t touching any SPAC post that much of a launch spike given the last performance. 

Will be watching it for sure. Good luck out there people!
#Short 🥭, it’s gonna crash bigly
I don’t know what market you’ve been looking at, but it’s been pretty bullish so far this year.
Historical moment and amazing. The future is looking excellent.   Now UK needs to buy more SMRs.

Lets do work. See the new news. Flew a 747 on clean fuel
Welcome to the T train !!
The bets aren't "closing" numbers though, its only if it hits that number.  If you said GME 200 1w and it hits 201, but closes at 180 at the end of the week, you would win.
Can someone explain why some apps are slow to put on new tickers but others are fast?

Yeah I'm waiting to buy more in 2 hours
Seriously. Finally some premarket movement and it’s this
🤔
Everything is getting dumped to fomo mango. I have a bad feeling.
Are there any memes for the mango stock?
🥭 in talks with MyPillow merger
GME still solid ...chill
Trump 2024
Mango was at $30 earlier premarket, this MF’r is building pressure to blow.
Who’s bag holding 82 on mango right now?
Don't do this to me GME...i stayed with you through the dark times.
This happened before when one of those talentless singers said, ‘who even uses Snapchat anymore?’, nosedive into an abyss.
I don't like it. *It makes my ween tingly*

But DWAC... ooh, that crazy 🥭 got a *dump truck* ass.
Thank you ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
This mango thing is literally destroying the value of every position I have. This is starting to look like a death spiral.
You actually think its gonna moon for 2 weeks?
Premarket opens, I’m buying more this Train is full steam ahead.
Does this mean it'll climb back up with all the social media platforms?
And with a few taps I don’t have to use either of those dogshit browsers.
True, although this 7 green days have been suspiciously low volume, still impressive. And yes, my 401k always be buying
Im not a fan of orange man but free money is free money.

Shorts enabled for mango
My bet is on Norwegian earnings next week.
Around $4.6 profit per piece at open. Congrats and fuck you
I like PLTR the software.  I dont like the stonk anymore.  Best decision of my investing life was paperhanding PLTR on 2/24 for GME when I saw it pop into the 50s.

Mango is gonna be a wild ride.
I’m dumping my last 300 shares and rotating into 🥭
Thank you for caring.
Market rises on fear as well as hope.  In fact the market always goes up regardless of any circumstances.
Today
Exp.?
Meteor. Unless it contained a large amount silicon, that would be extremely bullish no matter the body count of its impact.
Ok wut??
I bought a $55.5 put at the top before earnings. Any idea what that will be looking like at open?
It's inseparable from markets
Prob by 1 week
Mom… why do people price mango at $69.42 per piece? Isn’t it $0.99 at Food for less?
Yep
is DWAC on fidelity?
Fuck off with that shit. Between those megathreads and RH’s bullshit it ruined that run.
Up for my son's morning bottle. Crazy that we're going to hit ATH today.
Mango must of did this because he knows Hocus Pocus 2 in the works 

Did a dr. Sleep to Baldwin

And now coming for main Sanderson witch
This guy knows what’s up 😎
Here you go buttercup r/politics
But I might
Orange man be like: stonks only go up. Look at my stonk.  Up bigly.  Bers r fuk.
DWAC in not on my trading app (etoro)
What exactly would tank this market lol. Pretty much all of that dip in after hours is gone.
Always gotta complicate things
haha just guys being dudes classic
Yes
Dude I want to buy puts on that shit so bad
TRUMP!!!
Don't confuse our love for easy gains with any political leanings.
YUGE
I’m here. There are a lot of us.
He's real sleepy ...unfortunately
I would say no.  If I say GME closes at 200 on Thursday, but the bell says 180 and my friday open its 210, I still lost.  

Goes by option logic.  For that is the way here.
🥭 options wen?!?!?!???!!!?!
So fun and mango are related? 1000% gains today?
[deleted]
WE LIKE THE STOCK!
I love mango
[deleted]
One riding it's coattails for being involved with trump before. Up 350 percent pm  GUH
I don't know.  I cant read.
Something tells me these last two months of the year 

Gonna be like a little mini Armageddon 🤔

Pick a side...and good luck :)
I won’t.
Good to buy !
Spactacular if you will.
Yupppp webull sucks but least I can play in the mornings. Up 60 percent already
the CNBC dude told me to buy APPLE but i bought MANGO
Agreed. I like money and this is a good opportunity. Stop loss up and I can't lose. I don't give a shit about anything else behind it
RYCEY guy, where you at?
I wonder if my dad would be proud. 🥭
Don't think Apple can half FB overnight. The reason advertisers flock to FB is because of the ability to precise target their audiences. If they prioritize privacy FB wouldn't have an edge over other social media platforms. 

Also I have 0 faith Mark's metaverse will work out.
Much as I don’t care for the orange man, the fact remains that the gain on the spac is spectacular.
Who’s Gary Gensler?
Wow ok "fun" guess I'll go fuck myself for thinking about boarding that PM rocket when my shit broker opens
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/BurnGMEBurn** bet **DWAC** goes from **74.59** to **125.0** before **2021-10-24 04:57:51.332301-04:00**
7 days in a row green. Looking for 8
HAHAHA..


This gave me my best laugh of the whole week!

Thanks :)
Imagine placing puts on spy, thats some burry logic right there
Gensler said we are ok. No collusion here
Just hang around la fitness 

Should be able to catch some tang there
If someone makes a banbet and it hits the target in PM/AH, but not in normal trading hours, does it count as a win?
Nah many of us are fine, but Mango is money. The people saying shit like Trump 2024 though should get banned, but dont kill the Mango hype!!
Yeah! Fuck the HeDgieS!
People with Android don't have any money. Shitty ad segment.
Don't kill it like that
Is it above VWAP?
Mango mango mango

You can still buy with unsettled cash

Just can't sell or you get penalized

Who knew Evergrande would be a red herring.  The true contagion was SNAP all along.
Trump was the only president wsb needed, not this sleepy pos
Yes SEC, this comment right here.
[deleted]
Chill, we like Mango here but uhhhhhh
Thought Elon was the daddy.
It's been a tough year for sure. 

But it's a good company with a bright future.  The stock is only dogshit until it isn't. I felt the same about TSLA when I worked there from 2016 to 2019: an innovative tech company with good leadership and boring stock movement.
The technicals on 🥭  look good.  Broke thru its 200 day moving average.

Nobody cares about INTC being down 10%. Only memes![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
I don't think so. Just use privacy as an argument. Say every ad is run on individual phones and data never leaves them. Boom. Consumer protection.

Privacy is Apple's greatest strategic leverage. None of the others can claim it. At some point Apple will utilize this to the fullest. They already are. Snap tanking and blaming Apple is just a minor sign. They could eradicate 50% of FB market value in one day. They own the system. The others are just living there for rent. Zuck know this. That's why he want to build his own system, Metaverse stuff.
I’ve been toying with the idea of establishing a hefty position at end of year or q1 next year. How long do you see them continuing to trade sideways before actually making stock gains ?
at least they get to post loss porn on wsb
Time to fomo into 🥭. Stayed away from stonks for awhile and this is what happened
It’s already in the works my friend.  They’re gonna keep halting and halting.
Uh oh looks like the lefty short sellers are trying to cancel the Donald. Keep throwing money in boys!
Not out yet. Probably in 2 weeks.
Mango needs its own megathread
android devices are still the majority of the smart phone market share though
PLTR is dogshit , make gains elsewhere and go back when the fundamentals finally catches up to it's valuation which will start the actual bull run. The people who held PLTR since the start of the year literally lost almost a year worth of gains , huge ass opportunity cost in a bull market.
Mango makes Spacs great again
My Grindr buddies were tossing around my unwashed panties and taking turns wearing them on their head
people said same thing on last earning
Probably have some legality issue behind this plan to flush it out like you envision
$FELCH
Candy corn is violence
Hope it keeps coming down in PM so I can buy more Mango at open before the takeoff
I was 100% invested in PLTR before yesterday. But now I've diversified by buying mango shares, also. 

So this is what it means to be "financially responsible."
Condolences to anyone who played SNAP. Not a nice way to start your weekend.
What's sus?
where do you buy puts?
Send invite
Thank god WSB has embraced politics.
Its just the beginning. Boomers are gonna be rushing in in the coming weeks
Did y’all see CNBC blame the volatility on the Apes yesterday?!?!  Many didn’t even know about it
lol it’s all good bro
Apple could dismantle the whole online ads industry in one single update. That's power. That's why Google is paying them $10 billion a year just to be default browser search in Safari.

It would not surprise me, if Apple went balls deep into the ads space, and singlehandedly forced Google, FB and Snap to pay hefty commissions to do ads on iOS and MacOS. Or simply made their own system and took over the whole industry.

They can do the same thing for ads as they did for music and is doing for games.
imaging mango bailout evergrande
25k at a time
Intel is a good dip to buy IMO
MANGO made him hit the self destruct button
No dude no it won’t fit in there it’s too big
Been eyeing it since last night, cant buy till 7am tho 😩😩😩
We like the stock! 🥭
Fuk hood
mango og daddy
Any moron saw that TrumpSpac was going to moon. The real win is selling it at the top and riding puts down to the bottom when it dumps.
Snap geeeez
Nvm its been, ive been out of loop on the news. Sorry
I concur
Congrats I got SNAP puts but they might not be as juicy as your puts 😏
TeslAa
$TSLA is the ultimate reminder because rich people  were shorting it and not your average 7 figure day trader Andy.
I got it around 15$. I am Deciding if I want to sell now with small loss or wait for BABA to fall.
should it be out by now, if it’s today, or maybe at market open/right before?
Fomo into 0DTE Tesla 910c and then sell into mangooo
has no one said anything lol?
Don’t forget!!!  DeeWack and Fun go hand and hand!!!
Can't believe 🥭 9x a stock overnight
Read my previous comment again lol
If you don't like the stock, don't touch it at all. Never go full retard and short it. $HOOD was the reminder. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)

ALL IN $ASS
I think TSLA might pump in the first hr
Can't wait till world wakes up

And starts slapping MANGO wank on their face 

Ill b sleep by then though
Donaldino Pumperino is back! 🥭🚀
Alec Baldwin so triggered by DWAC he shot 2 people.

What are some good ones to play 0DTE today? FB comes to mind…
Either jump on the train and ride to tendie town, or don’t and watch everybody have fun. Or it could crash and kill everybody but you can always come back. I’m in
That shit needs to start coming day 1 on SPACS

Gonna buy more right now at 7am

Took some heavy thinking though 

But think its good for it

😭
If you want confirmation bias on mango.

Big chunk of family is all about trump.

I told them pre market to buy it. Before I bought. Didn't listen and didn't even know trumpet was even doing TRUTH.

I THEN BOUGHT 450 SHARES.

I told them again they missed out.

Now they are all going to FOMO in at open today. Retards.

Buy more
[This retard that shorted mango at probably like 12 or some shit lost $70k , he closed his short at $14. This is why mango stock had heavy selling pressure at premarket which made me sold the stock for a lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLLJFHKpzd8). I'm laughing at all the retard shorts that got burned yesterday , you know there are definitely some retards that lost more than $70k and blew up their account because of trading halts.
MAGAMAN saving the markets
Oh!!! It’s not over yet!!
Who gave you the heads up at $9.90? 

I need this hero in my life.
going all in snap leaps
I got in at 14 and sold off enough to cover my initial investment now I’m riding with house money all the way to the top
Don't fuck with JPOW.
I can eat MANGO 🤣🤣
I swear DWAC had options when i looked wednesday. Hurry the fuck up MMs.
I bought calls on $snap. Who coming to my funeral?
👁🥭👁
[deleted]
I’d go with 25% from open does that appease you ?
Dump
Damn this is fun 🥭!
I mean sure, but let’s not pretend snaps earnings were bad, they were fine. Social media is down because there’s a new competitor. Market was going to find any excuse to dump.
[deleted]
Originally said 100 end of day visual mod didn’t like that
i love daddy trump
Sad
Buy the dip!!  Watch it sore in the morning.  Then activate your stop loss.  Make a little money and move on.  Not financial advise but that what I’m doing 🤣
MANGO MAN WINS, FUCK YOUR 120% EPS BEAT
Think there will be a dip before the rip?

Thats the merger, of course it’s trump’s spac merging with trump’s ‘digital’ company using the people dumb enough to invest in it and featuring the most ridiculous rhetoric.

Its going to be a social media site that is essentially just a maga FB group without the monetization lmao
But your using toilet water for your cubes :/
And then sell too early  😔
Far from meme….. more like the next Amazon
That company seems SUS
what kinda shit bet is that? it's already +70% premarket
Baba = 💙
Up 474% on 🥭

😂😂. Trump keeps proving how stupid America is from top to bottom when he isn’t even trying.
Feeling pretty good About my banbet 1w MANGO $200 😎
That could pop this bubble,   or people just shake it off and buy more calls. 😆
Just for fun bought a $13 OTM 1dte $62 put and It looks like it should be worth $500-600 at open.  Small but insane.
bro if u just bought you probably wouldn’t be mad
Spy would hit 600 immediately
DWAC retard
I understand the statistics and analysis you’re bringing to the table…but come on!!!  It’s Daddy Trump!!!
Or DWAC
MANGO MAN KEEP PUMPINGGGGG TO THE MOOON
What’s so abysmal about a 120% EPS beat and a 3% revenue miss on estimate but still an increasing revenue…?
Cause we are liiiiving in a Digital World, and I will Acquire Digital gold.
they're definitely getting the 10x the gains compared to everyone in DWAC lol
Bro lmao you’ve been on this sub for a few months? We’ve been like this for years, to be fair we used to have some good DD once in a while, but at the end of the day it’s all just a casino. This is all fugazi, none of this shit actually works long term, even the so called safe strategies. This is just white collar gambling. If you want to invest this isn’t the right sub and never has been.
Lol dwac is killing it
Next president
Sir there is hard resistance at 900.

Well...what if we just gap over it 🤔
!ban bet DWAC +25% 1 day
idk, I’ve never tried to short PM. Probably not because it was just some random spac a few days ago lol
What stick is Mango?? What’s the ticker?
Please no. That was a horrible time.
[deleted]
[deleted]
All in Mango stock!! Credit card loans on margin Lets goooooo get rich or die trying!!! Stick it to the libs
Mango getting added to S&amp;P 500??
ahh ok. MEME stock? ALL IN

Finally got myself an ice cube tray that frees up all ice cubes with one twist of the tray. The one I was using for several years, it took a lot of violence and luck to get that shit out. Unbelievable
He’ll always be my president 🥰
+679%. *nice*
JFC this is going to be FUN in a few hours.
DWAC duh
And maybe 🤔 some $CHGG
It’s a first of it’s kind. It’s a political meme stock, The Donald knows what he’s doing, his whole family is gona be hyping it up for a month
Truly words I didnt expect to read in 2021.

Yet here I am mad at myself that I only bought 10
you can't trust big tech social media companies
all social media stocks getting rekt in premarket due to SNAP's abyssmal earnings report.
because it went up 360% in one day and is up 44% AH
Probably by open
Yes
I’ll kiss you if you just made me money
I am
i gonna miss it.  non of my brokers have it.
Ex president
Some people wait a lifetime...for a moment like thisssss 🥭
Yeah. Played that but also reminder the market looking good to me?
Mangoes in lambos
I’m a bit out of the loop here. When people say MANGO 🥭, do they mean the ticker $DWAC?
Omg i cant wait till all his base goes all in and then the massive rug pull and cry that its the liberals fault for putting gensler in charge
Yeah I'm waiting b too with fidelity 

Another 2.5 hours to go
This opportunity comes twice in a lifetime
Why is DWAC getting so much hype? I don’t understand
Honestly GME not having fuckery would be scarier
Yo did any of you have puts on SNAP?

Are you winning?
I was watching and got the heads up at $9.90. But no didn’t play it because I have a life and a real job to go to
# pound me harder elon
Look on the bright side you can buy at 50 and sell at 100.  That aint bad.

This is totally a P&amp;D but you can't underestimate the Cult of Orange Man.  Like him or hate him i think they absolutely Diamond Hand that shit like GME apes on steroids.
There are people out there that tried to play the snap earnings rather than to hop in with the mango
Poor mango people getting 400%+ gains  lol
Not yet. That's when the real fun starts.
You could wait 10+ years for 700% gains on your boomer stocks (I doubt Tesla will be worth 6.4T in 2031) or you could have bought 🥭 yesterday at PM and gotten 700% by now.
Yup…same here…along with $PHUN
All those rallies 

I member 

All that cash
I'm a bear 🐻  and even I eat mangos 🥭
Get on IB my comrade  🇨🇦
If you didnt buy, you mustve not heard Bill maher prediction on 2024. If The volume is there to buy the stock if its there to vote .
All in on $DWAC
Mangos spac is worth the 10B market cap loser!
Some of yall didnt follow the old addage, keep your enemies closer.
Still no options right?
Do not miss your chance to mango
Can you even short the mango yet?
Yes buy the top itll go well
You may want to try r/investing instead
Most Trump supporter boomers either have no money, or so much money they have actually smart people managing their portfilios
Mangos have always been my favorite fruit, now I can afford to buy thousands of pounds of them
Easy to see who missed out lmao
I agree 

Here have a MANGO
&gt; Fuck off, you're just a poor person who doesn't understand how the world works.
Buy one fucking ticket bro it’ll be fun
Bears know they are powerless against Mango. They have no argument.
Lol what? Every major retailer uses PayPal. It's 100 times more convenient and safer than having to enter my CC info one by one for bestbuy, target, Microcenter, EA, Steam, Nintendo, ebay, aliexpress and a million other places.

Sounds like you're just broke and never buy shit so you're not PayPals target audience anyway.
Except all the corrupt mfers actually want this to nonstop pump. Gme with no fuckery = wassup lambos
so leave then
This is the GME REWIND!!!!

Short play 

OG GME long play though
*you only get two shots*
Evergrande could fall today and nobody would notice. LFG
Everyone can buy 1000 acres of land to grow 🥭 with all the 🥭 gains.
People getting butthurt for not buying![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Gonna fomo into the ticker riding 🥭 coattails. Why doesnt questrade premarket open until 7 garbage broker
Easy
Poor mangos have never had their SPAC commons brutally shorted before &amp; it shows
What's the worst that could happen?
Downvoters out in full force this morning already???
A French vagina 

Sounds delicious 🍩
What’s his problem
[deleted]
It's like getting a chance for a redo with GME.  I have Lose Yourself by Eminem cranking.
We've been pumping 🥭 since last year , remember KODAK? This shit ain't new.
Ok so let’s see they are saying that SNAP makes a statement about privacy changes and causes Facebook, Twitter, and Google to drop at close. DWAC runs up 380% and another 100% at premarket open. Hmmmm I wonder why
Su Bae still paying.  ♥️
Doesn’t mean it’s righteous
would be nice. i have tesla at 899. again brought at the top :)
True, but TONS of Trump supporter boomers will poor their savings into this thing
I’m in his hometown right now, I’ll go tell him you like it.
No they were selling MAGA shirts today next to taco bell. 

I drove right by them 

They were busy 

They will start buying next week!
I’m done. This whole fucking place is officially a pump and dump wasteland. No real DR that actually means shit anymore.  No sharing strats or any meaningful ideas anymore. 

IM SHOUTING INTO THE FUCKING VOID 

THIS PLACE FUCKNG SUCKS NOW and has been shitty for a while now
We're in the 2nd inning.
The mouse dies in the mouse trap because it doesn't understand why the cheese is free.
$DWAC 💡
If I could do it again, I could have afforded the low-risk of putting 1/20th of my portfolio in his SPAC, knowing his historic fanatical following
-10% on INTC feels about right if their multiple wasn’t so low already with solid revenue growth and enterprise GPUs inc 2022. Long dated calls look tempting
F.
Buying a man bag?
The don family is coming on Fox in a few minutes. You know they are going to pump this up. Boomers will see it drinking coffee before their miserable job commute
stop tempting me
TSLA puts
Idk, my gains are looking pretty righteous right now.
GS just hiked it's PT for mango to $1200
GME...still The One
Werd on da stretz iz, nokia phones will come wit trumpies social media app installed and only using gsat sattelites. 

Not fin advice
dropping it so GME holders have less money to buy 🥭 when they FOMO in
#TOO LONG DIDNT READ

#MANGO

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀
Oh shit that’s 80% of my folio
Am I really gonna FOMO into a DWAC because of 🥭man
Need roku to pull something crazy out of its ass and go up 40 dollars like last earnings 😔
Let’s do this
It was a bad idea buying into it like after China already died heavily.
Atleast TSLA is going to 1000 today
I bought a handful just because of that.

Might be a P&amp;D (scratch that it IS a P&amp;D) but I think it has more P before the D.
God it’s just free market right now I already came twice
Need to sell hood and sofi 


Get mangos

Boomers buying the dip on real stonks
Since no one has said it. SPY ATH today
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Actually the market cap is 7B after merger if it stays at the current price or 14B if they add $825M additional shares. $10 NAV = $875M valuation , it's at 80 right now so $875 x 8 = $7B
My cash still hasn't settled
Live picture of me when i said no to buying at $19 

# 🤡
They already agreed to a merger. Trump Media is being valued at $850 million to their $300 million
Replace Facebook and Instagram with MySpace and Napster and pretend it’s 2008.

That’s literally how dumb you sound
He’s the fucking devil. Did all the sins many times over. Money does not equal righteousness
The as long as you love me song by Justin Bieber is actually kinda dope
Market is down , oh SNAP! 😂
Totally normal pre market action price on GME
facebook cratering
Ok. I admit it. Yang was a bad idea.
BOOMERS haven't even bought in yet 

They coming next week 😂
&gt; taking my odds

got any more of them odds?

Tbh 25k in, either go hella up. Or maybe lose 5-6k fuck it
Advertising affects it a lot as well, which is why all the social media platforms are down
Dwac puts
donald pump still doing his thang lol
Come on mahn 

FUKN MANGOS!!!!

Big juicys
Dwac, like lucid is gonna tank post merger announcement. It makes no sense to place this high of a premium on a spac before merger because details of the valuation in the deal are unknown.

A spac is just a pile of money that they are going to give to a company and those spac shares are gonna represent x% of the newly merged company. By paying a premium of 660% you’re literally saying no matter what valuation the spac and 🥭 agree to, that you will value it 660% more. No matter what. Of course seeing all this hype for the company, the deal is already gonna come out with a high valuation. Then you are gonna be left holding the bag because the way spacs work is that $10/share is going to be the price that reflects whichever valuation they choose. 

This is exactly what happened with LCID, hylion , and every other spac that had a crazy pre merger run up that fell post merger. Those were memes too at the time but they all tanked because when a company makes a deal valuing itself at X you’re not gonna find new buyers willing to pay 6X for it right away
They don’t need 60, they need 10. There’s 10 democrats interested in breaking up (insert any company here that is worth over 1b). All the republicans would need to do is fall in line. Which they will, if they’re continually attacked.

No reason to assume what type of content will be on the site. It should look like fb twtr or any other social media site, some crazies, some not.
Im telling you..friday news cycle..major circuit breakers..today is gonna be like gme in jan on roids.
why the fuck etoro does not have it. I need to bagholding trumps stonk.
No one understands how much people love this guy. Im in a rural area and hes 2nd to god to some ppl
Right, he’s crafted a political meme stock that if it catches on in the right circles on social media could still 10x cuz market cap is still on sub $2B. So many fanstical fans will see it as a test to support Trump

We've got some fine apes 🦍.  The best apes in facts.  We know the weak animals, the string animals, the overrated ones.  But when we all come together in one big 🥭  family, we can do anything.  I really believe that.  God bless America, I love you, good night! 👍
They won’t ban his social media company unless there is rampant hate speech, calls for violence etc. on the website. If there is, no Democrat will stand up for it, and Republicans will never have the 60 vote filibuster proof votes to actually “break up” big tech.
🥭 gonna swing like the ape stocks in January. Halts and all. Get your popcorn ready fellas, it's gonna be a great show.

How can you trade and just ignore this lol . This bull is yuge .
Premarket price action on 🥭 is so much fun to watch
People underestimating the momentum of DWAC thinking its gonna drop. The dude has so many fanatical supporters that are going to be dumping their life savings into it and taking mortgages out on their homes to buy in.
Damn $XLC in shambles
i would but not every fucking broker have trumps stock.

Pull your initial investment and let the rest ride. No losses on the books

So should I FOMO 25k in DWAC tomorrow, either I get a bag or I get fucked. I already got fucked before
Spy
Yep i feel it, spy hits 460 today and mango 350+. Lfg lads strap in
&gt; I'm not sure.
Yes it is.. Social security, Medicare, Medicaid, public education, are undeniably socialist programs. Individuals money is taken from them to purchase benefits on behalf of everyone. The degree to which we have socialism is about half, because the government spends half of our GDP. We could move towards a more free market society or move towards a more socialist society, it’s not some absolutist system where we are one or the other.

Damn :(
The premarkets themselves open at 4am eastern.  Different brokers set time limits on trading that doesnt always conform w that.  IBKR Pro is 4am eastern.  Idk what Fidelity does.
No it’s the fruit, big shortages thanks to Brandon. 

Buy calls.

They kinda did that back in 08, didn't they?
Oh wow. That Baldwin story is fucked up
Fuck you futes. Stop this whipsaw shit
It bled AH for no reason
Hi
Gigachad
Would fuck a femgirl
Wouldn’t be wise, the republicans have already begun to make noise about breaking up big tech, if they continue to be hunted down and censored the intensity of those calls will only increase. It’s not smart business for private entities to create political enemies. It wouldn’t be hard for republicans to get democrat support to start breaking up companies, Dems already want that.
But it’s depends on those and is bound by their ToS lmao

Which puts 🥭 in the same position as he was last year
What does ape like?🍌 or 🥭
mangoes of course!

without options its not even comparable in thx slightest. nothing DWAC can do to turn my 2k into 100k a month like my  GME calls did in January

Nah… I only feel pain and shame nowadays… otherwise im totally desensitized
Boomers are going to find out in the coming weeks. 100 easy, its just the start of the wave
When will you learn that your actions have consequences!!
So I saved up a year and have 10k… what should I yolo it on?
SHOP bleeding :(
by 4:05AM, DWAC will be $70+
Maybe he can sell paintings as apart of the business, works for Joe’s kid
DWAC = Apple + Twitter + Facebook as per their doc and filling. 

$65.55 share price =  $1.69B cap
$200 for = 6B cap. 

TWTR is 52 bn
FB is 963 bn
AAPL 2.5 T
🔥🥭
It has all the potential to have a GME type breakout, I'm kicking myself for not finding out about it until today. Have an order for tomorrow morning. Half the country LOVES him like no other. Most of those people don't know about DWAC yet. Once all the news sites start picking up the story, (an you know they can't resist anything trump related), all the boomers are going to know about it. Its the start of the wave.
Add to that, the amount of retards who will short this because orange man bad, you have the potential of an ACTUAL short squeeze.
The chance to 10x is a possibility imo.

The only thing I'm scared of is trump walking back the statement somehow, which is a total possibility.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

You do realize that if that happens they will be sued to no end. They are already dealing with some possible monopoly issues. Any actions taken in an attempt to derail competition will not go well for them.

You’re so fucking stupid lmao. You’re lucky they don’t exist.

overthrowing the legitimate government is illegal.
When you buy a put… you make money when the stock is under the strike price, not over it. 


Your math is calculating profit on puts when current price is over strike price?? 
Your math is really wrong lmao 

You would lose your ass in this case. 

👑🐌👑
All owning a business is being guaranteed future profits, that’s what taxes are. Whatever the governments effective tax rate is, that’s how much they own of you. You said you pay 17%, the government owns 17% of you. That is socialism. They don’t need to literally own the company if they own your future earnings.
XPOF
It’s at $65

$1p would cost $6400 with no premium

I’d sell them right away for at least $4600 profit on each contract and that’s with no IV premium factored in.

65-10=55

55x100= $5500 per contract with no IV premium


Is my math wrong here? It’s fucking late and I need to sleep.
Has nothing to do with taxes. Only that the gov controls business. I don’t see the gov taking g over Apple, Microsoft, GM, Ford or Honeywell or any of them. 

Government spending is always a issue that never gets solved. I’ve seen the same arguments going back to when Clinton was president. It’s all political. That never changes. 🥭 tax cuts are estimated to adding to the deficit $8 Trillion. Thats from a side all about reducing spending. Their point stands if stop spending money but doesn’t address the deficit their adding. 

It’s all bullshit and at this either side is the same. Dems increase taxes and spending. But not enough to offset spending. Republicans decrease taxes but not enough to offset spending. 

It’s all about having a split Congress like we do now. Nothing gets passed, nothing changes. The market loves that
Probably will come down before that

Increasing taxes, increasing government spending, is socialism. It takes money out of the hands of private individuals and puts it in the hands of public officials to spend on our behalf. Our government spends more than half of our GDP, so we are more than halfway to full on socialism.

This is so retarded I love it

Doesn’t mean tax increase either. All I know is I paid 17% in federal tax and I’m not sitting on 7 figures. Anyway this is the definition of socialism

Why would they ban his shit? I don’t think they can just ban stuff cause they don’t like him. It’s illegal or whatever.
He’s not a real socialist. And regan isn’t that great in my book. Fuck he hid his spending by moving social security funds. Biden played into the radical left to get elected but that’s not him and it shows. He’s more middle road. But still not a great president

a lot of FUD on that one, and that fear dissipated considerably when the CCP suggested they list on the Hang Seng too. I own calls on it myself, and expect it to at least hit its IPO price within a year, if not months. That's my own sentiment, and I'm only wagering a small fraction it

Upside is you won’t get banned and 🌈 mod will pin that you won a ban bet and show your record, 1-0
I like how you use your own subjective opinion to objectively classify people based on your own personal metric system to determine who is stupid or not, hands up for this progressive man right here!

70% of spacs went below their floor this year. This will be one of those
DWAC
Sorry, havent been active in a while. What’s the upside to a banbet? Havent ever seen one
im the guy hiding behind the guy who made the calls. might be a coward but imma win this shit.
It can't go to 10 because 10 is the floor.
Can’t short dwac can we since it just listed?
Bears like mangos too.
What's a mango?
Somebody do a dwac 200 ban bet 1 week out
its nice to get a sense for who are traders and who are retards.
Puts on $CHUDs
Do you recommend buying DIDI?
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/sqesla** bet **DWAC** goes from **65.5** to **117.0** before **2021-10-29 03:16:39.062200-04:00**
!banbet dwac 117 1w
I’m talking about internet money. People who used to call it a bubble and a Ponzi scheme are largely now converts and starting to say that it’s the future for no other reason than the price has risen so much which is when you know you’re entering the late stages of the cycle
John Deere should just add stock grants to the factory worker’s pay. Make them have a stake in the company’s earnings. Boom, incentives align and everyone should be happy. I work in tech and every engineer is paid in shares along with their salary because they are producing the product. No reason it can’t be done in other industries too

boomers in on this, atleast gonna keep it above 20, gg
Mango talk is better than the 2 months of bear talk and recession predictions I had to deal with
What does SNAP have to do with social media? All they make is Snapple drinks.
AOC
That was in response to my comment. Idk who downvoted because you're definitely right lmao
then jpowbatman comes in and rips their throats out.

Holy shit do I buy the SNAP dip?

If MANGO moons tomorrow 

I might go blonde 

And bleach my asshole 

Get a taste of the glory. See what it taste like (nacho libre voice)
RED LIGHT. GREEN LIGHT. ON YOUR PORTFOLIOS TOMORROW 😈
Well it’s 4. I’m drunk but made the bet anyway
Wait until at least 9am to decide. You’ll get an idea if it’s good or not from the first 30 minutes.
What’s mango again?
Also they don’t own the servers that host their shit. That won’t last long.
The Circle Closed Purple
Yassss
Nah. Biden is bad but not as bad as rotten 🥭. Just sad that a country of 350 million people can only come up with a mango or Biden
If I’m ever in a situation where the governments wants to torture me for information, just get a big booty Latina to sit on my face with her slim thick ass, it might be a slow process to break me but it def will
Thought you said 2w?
fuck this market.   i lost too much money playing options last few months.       i’m just gonna shit post on here for a few weeks

also love that i will be banned in 10 min
No. Hopefully grayscale will be able to get GBTC converted to an ETF eventually. BITO being based on futures means it's going to do worse than what it's tracking over the long run. Check out USO versus the price of oil.
amd gonna open at like 124 at this rate
Remember when I bought bark? Yea shouldn't have done that
😂😂😂

BEAUTIFUL

Respect to this Chad
I'm throwing in premarket tomorrow 

MANGO gots Hos
Can’t wait for another 200% or so in a few hours
I’ll be looking forward to my award for winning banbot 😘
mah! pah! its like a farmers market but fer big city shops.
Yeah, and it better be a short and simple video or a simple slogan written on a hat... We can't read or understand much more than that around these here parts.
I'm guessing he didn't vote for MANGO :/
BNTX in the pre-market, wants $300 today
Watching this sub as they fomo everything into 0dte options bc snap tanked everything afterhours. 

I’ll wait for my setups.

Edit: who am I kidding I’ll gamble it all to.
Seperate 🥭 thread @ mods
I got downvoted about fb being at ath by Christmas. Don’t know why that would be. But full disclosure, also on 🥭
Made my ban bet. You?
This guy is tuff
wait so you are saying dont assume someone has a 30 iq when really they have a 70 iq?
Oh well. Thanks though
Banned. MAGA stock going to 1000
I tried giving you an award, but they're out of MANGOS

Once iOS and Android ban the mango app, it will be a good short.
!banbet dwac 10 4w
You're about to get banned faster than a Trump supporter on Twitter
corn has always existed in a bubble cycle. dont argue for or against it, just profit.
You say this like either are a problem
Do you think buying $BITO is worth it?
🥭 APP 😂
Yes
youre hired.
This fucking thread is sad and pathetic. BUY THE FUCKING TECH DIP YOU ARE BEING GIFTED TOMORROW.  Fuck a 🥭 stock that’s worthless for a company that’ll be banned in 1 year and already ran 300% without options.  It’s dead 

Matter of fact - 

!banbet dwac 10 2 weeks
Talk to me when options are open
Mango 🤔
Word, I’ll keep my fingers crossed 🤞
Its just transitory
Should i fomo on 🥭 stonk or too late?
Short it. Enjoy being the one guy that makes it work after everyone else has given up after losing money.
gonna be TMTG. or TRUF if you wanna be pc about it
Good mod

What was March 2020 then
where can i find the commotion for DWAC
VXX would have a new rival for tickers perpetually going down
with earnings next week $FB will move. what direction? who knows.
Probably. Once a month, Friday SPY 0DTEs provide some entertainment

I'm going off the rails on a 🥭 train!
Nope. It’ll be MNGO
Yes, the ever imminent crash.
Take Boeing out and yes so I can short it
Yeah lmaooo
Nancy Pelosi
Y’all think it would be a bad idea for 0DTE SNAP or FB calls at market open for a short sqze? Surely there’s a high chance of profit with all the volatility in the first five min of trading.
Gonna rot your brain son

Intel, IBM, Nokia, Blackberry, GE, Boeing and AT&amp;T should merge into one mega tech company.
I hope after a merger DWAC turns into a TRMP ticker
Jaye summers
Yea.  There was one seen with an actress called Mango that I watched yesterday.  Same feeling really.
Go on :/
You can't buy stock with EBT.
I won’t say it’s a bubble but you have mstr issuing debt to buy it and now an etf that buys futures contracts on it. Yet people will attribute fundamental reasons for the ascent in price. Okay fuck it it is a bubble. Just cause price rises for a year doesn’t mean it won’t come down. When this shit finally breaks its going to be a shit show but an entertaining one
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

I just like how it looks
I wonder which CNBC host gets fired for mentioning 🥭. I'm sure the execs over at Comcast have already banned talking about it during market hours.
Mango already made Baldwin hit self destruct for doing snl skits

Now lets see what he can do with this spac

This dude is working me between my legs his mouth action is unreal wow

Sooooo what’s up with futures. Up down?
Or wish that snap wasn’t halved?
What use
I know, i'm saying when they become available (whenever that is)
instructions unclear, not in kansas anymore
Did you mean $455?
I remember not playing it because it was dumb as shit
It hasn’t yet
+356% in a day isn’t a moon mission accomplished?!?!?!?  Just wait for the stock to settle and for options to be available
Yeah..GME my main honey

Wish I could of bought those 500 shares at $65

I'm going after it with MANGO though LOL
Yep. Takes awhile to get her revved up at her age
buy high in 🥭  
sell low in 🥭  
LFG
it's not getting options??
Gab didn’t even work properly. None of the censorship free platforms do. You can’t debate on FB, without some pussy crying &amp; reporting comments. A few of them &amp; you have a ban. Fair or otherwise. If it works &amp; welcomed all.. and libs didn’t boycott.. would be like the good old days. Before zuck went all control freak.
So the random tickers I picked, I’m down $500. Time to reload the app Monday
How?

Mango thread incoming so much spam
Salty I didn’t get on the tendie train but Su Bae treated me well today.
…and most of the dudes are bots. They’re female bots though.
We used to have real bears in here. Brave bears that went all in on puts during the buying opportunity of a generation. They were vaguely intellectual.
I would say because the competition has more room to make up
Same your mom will cum by lunch tmrw
someone's getting banned here
Yeah but Gab is full of literal neo-nazis, plus Trump has major pull and can get his supporters to sign up for dogshit if he wanted to which Gab cant do. In the end though you're right, for as much as people hate each others politics it's what brings debate and views, so this Trump thing will fizzle out at some point, but I still wouldnt try to short it just yet, it's got room to run
Bravo on asana
My Grindr buddies were tossing around my unwashed panties and taking turns wearing them on their head
If Mango could look me in the eye right now 

He would yell at me...buy the stock!!!

Me: yes sir :/
Sue bae won’t do us like that. They have a shit ton of cash to acquire and also to buy back
Can the mango thing get it's own thread for tomorrow so I can watch my SPY 456 calls die in god damn peace and quiet????
make your money boo boos, but anyone still getting grifted by mango is next level retard.

I do this for a living
when can you buy puts? couldn't today.
If Parler is on the shit list of left leaning 'big tech' like AWS, surely this new network will be too.   So what makes this new social network .. work ?   Hosting in Russia ?    Jump on some barely known company like Parler did with Skysilk ?   

I don't see a scalable solution unless Trump is planning to basically build a right-wing empire of internet backbone, search engine, payment provider, etc etc .. which if he's successful at might make him the richest and most influential person in the world .. but its a long long shot.
Drinking white claws and listening to Death Cab for Cutie.  Another great Thursday night
that was not really a miss. they beat EPS by a large margin, and were close on revenue. THey almost doubled YOY revenue.TSLA sank AH too, and had a big volume day, causing tech to sink.ANd then they rebounded while a lot of shit was still red. It looks veerrrrry similar to me.  


The movements bigger because SNAP is extremely volatile.
Yes. Among other reasons but yes
Nice try but no
Mango stonk only has 28 million shares outstanding and traded half a billion volume today. 

I suspect the real float is 100% locked down rn.

At least $10b assuming Vlad stays out of it
Too late!!!
lol no I took the word from someone in the industry that was confident a strike was "100% going to happen" and it appears it is not. For shame! The calamity!
That would be insane, overnight it would be legitimized
if you buy $DWAC you’re a racist
That was 8 months ago and a shit company not even 9 figs
It wasn't a social media site, it was a blog with the comments turned off.  The Trump ecosystem doesn't work without his borderline insane reply guys.  They are the key to value creation here.
Donnie might actually be a billionaire now

The fact that it's not down as much as the nasdaq, and tracking close to boomer Jones is a pretty good sign. It's a weird one for sure seeing as it usually fits somewhere in the middle.

Deplorable almost
these shares went up 400% in one day and were the main topic on America's most talked about option sub
True
Get a real brokerage account

Why can you see that? I think that's just what you want, not what you can see.
I'm throwing another 8k in premarket to mango

Mangosphere is the funniest greatest word I’ve ever heard
Didn't Gab tried what 🥭 is doing? I think what people like about other platforms (eg. twitter, facebook, reddit, etc.) is that people with different views can argue and post about current events, etc. I don't see liberals flocking to the truth netowrk so it'll be another 4chan /pol/.

Puts on 🥭.

I'd like to snap wish in half... oh wait... that already happened
Tesla will hit 950 by lunch tmrw
The actual product has virtually no potential. He tried to start a social media site before and failed spectacularly. This is a yuuge pump and dump, nothing else
Even if you’re desperate, do you want to be dead broke and desperate? Manage your risk. Put like 10k in it and if it pops take out your own bread and let it ride. If it falls then that’s too bad but you lost less than a third of your portfolio so you can still recoup. Your choice though, just trying to prevent you from being added to the list of loss porn on here
September and October was their time in the sun. Back to their holes they go.
OMG we will get Alex Jones back.  The worlds been much worse without his tinfoil.  This thing could have legs.
How is Twitter any different.  People cancel or block anybody that doesn't fit into their echo chamber
You mean, you actually have to go some research? God forbid
damn i missed the news, thats what i get for assuming. ill edit thank you.
Mango, it’s what plants crave
Because they aren't reporting incidents properly. Hospitals don't even have protocols to fill out the vaers paperwork.

I mean it can but the upside short term is a lot better
 anyone with a different view getting "cancelled" concerns me equally.
They call that an autism/myocarditis cocktail
Memes aside, I'm not gonna tell someone to go all in on any stock.  I do know I'm putting some into 🥭 tho.
If I was a billionaire, yes without a doubt.
wut? iatse isnt on strike.
everyone who said 🥭 in this thread is now ghey
How do you download a car?

It’s Friday already? Ready for some gainz
Any mango man remember Kodak?
Nightly reminder GME was a top 5 play in market history and the best play this year. 

Give respect where it's due. 

That said let's go Mango and Tesla. Cult stonks to the mfkn moon 🚀🚀
&gt; I think he was trying to shoot the director
Going to mix some Pfizer with my Moderna.  I think they call it speedballing
sounds like you can almost smell the juicy mango. but it's better for everyone that the "crazies" communicate in the open rather than not
Let's hope the GMOs work
Why was he pointing the gun at the director?
My take - well look back at this mango sich and well be like, yeah that was the beginning of the 🔝
Gahd damn it's friday again??
Will the bags match my AMC and SNAP bags? I want them to look good together.
17.5
TSLA is outselling every EV competitor in every market its currently in and will dominate the EV market in Europe when giga Berlin is up and running next year. Your garbage legacy automakers are done for.
I had 10/20 $445 calls that I sold at $447 on 10/18 because I was nervous for a dip on Tuesday. I suck at trading but i like gambling
GME is the best play this year and a top 5 all time.  95% of investors are green on it. 

Fkn dumb ass comment
Tbh, new 🥭 media venture (social media, TV, events, etc.) is only valued at a few billion. For perspective NFLX is valued at around $300B. The YouTube and YouTubeTVsegment of GOOG is likely worth over $500B by itself. Current value is roughly 50x lower than NFLX. Is it speculative? Fuck yea. Does it have legitimate upside potential from current price? Yea. It also has a spokesperson who, for better or worse, absolutely know how to attract attention. And it has the most meme potential of anything I've seen in a long time. All aboard the mango train! 🤠 🥭 🚆
&gt; Nah
No, but plenty of dudes pretending to be cute girls

Tbh I got into the mangosphere early but that's because I live and travel for work to areas outside major cities. Lived in a big city before and some people don't understand how crazy it can get outside the major metros.

Mango hasn't been heard from in months from major networks so of course people are flocking to one that is made by the dude himself. 

Not saying I think it succeeds but people are still pissed and need an outlet, which people are still learning is  a public company under some seemingly random ticker name.

I'm sorry friend. Would you like some pointers?
Market rotation to Mango
Driving a Tesla isn’t success, my ex got in at end of quarter 2 and he is the biggest loser I’ve ever met. Didn’t even yolo his paychecks on tsla calls or anything
Any recommendations?
Gotta go up though cause you can't sell yet
Coke can and it’s not even close.
Alright I put in for 50 shares on market open.
My ex got a Tesla on June 30th, he wasn’t supposed to get it until like Aug but one came available and they delivered it to him. If that’s not dedication to meeting deadlines then you’re gay
i honestly fear for a world where trump has its own social network. mankind will split in half to people who are using their brains, and people who will be brain washed by alex jones and david icke.

🥭options when
Any cute girls here?
How? I heard nothing about 🥭until premarket yesterday and now I’m up 394%
How will Mango Media handle the campaign of activists spamming everything and everyone with nonsense? Every time a 'right wing' labeled service is created it gets disrupted and kept low
its going to be beautiful.
🥭 to $400
I wanna go to bed but I need to finish my last truly first
imagine how many mangoes can be made using one mango seed, crazy
Check out my post I just made, I just posted to wsb
Joe Biden, Donald Trump. Cons call Biden Brandon for some reason, I guess mango is from association with orange?

Good thing I'm not invested in the UK.  Instead, hopping on the mango train 🥭 🚆.
Spy has gotta hit an all time high tomorrow
2 years when it was still 600k members
Only if they make their trades Public/real time
Edit: I assumed it was a scab as i thought iatse was on strike. They averted that for now so i was wrong.
Yeah as thin as the worlds thinnest dick, like a medical condition thin
:4645:
Mangos for breakfast
hopefully the fed gets trapped supporting markets with ever more ridiculous amounts of stimulus until TSLA is worth $100T and abandons auto manufacturing entirely and just sells stock as its business
Mango mania
Lmfao 😂
Pretty sure I read the mango play here a day early and ended up google finding an article with the merger company's name. Searched tickers from there. Kinda shitty but the news wasn't everywhere until today.

So I guess you have to dig still which sucks but it's more entertaining than cnbc's website
Could 10x if you go to your mirror at night, close your eyes, and say Donny Pump 3 times before going to bed.
Bruh, it's at a 1.6b market cap. This shit is an easy 200-300x. Easy. Maga dudes literally stormed the fucking capital. You don't think they gonna dump their life savings into mango if he tells them to?
I can’t believe they fire real blanks

Ya know…fuck it. I want politicians to participate in the market. Let’s keep the party going.
Ur fucked mate your the next Brian laundry 🧺
You haven’t been here that long I see.
46, 45.
What about music? It's pretty much the same thing. Like a capella
The fact the futes are so boring tonight actually has me hopeful we'll recover tomorrow. I think the whales are waiting on the big brain five head motherfuckers to tell them how much the impact will hit the rest of FAANG, and to flip the risk ON switch.
Like pencil thin?
So YUGE, it’s remarkable really. My friends, and I have smart friends, much smarter than you, say it’s the greatest most phenomenal stock they’ve ever seen. It only goes up, just look at your 401K’s. We’re making some big moves and it’s just going to be fantastic.
If someone is telling you to buy snap tomorrow just know that they're trying to dump their bags on you

Both sides are retarded for assuming they are correct. No one knows what’s going to happen with GME and the people who claim to know are honestly weird. Don’t care which side you’re on Zzzzzz🥱

Are we able to speak freely about GME here? 

Because I have a question, is this ComputerShare thing the final straw? Is it the endgame that ends the conspiracy theories? 

If registering the float doesn’t cause the moass, where will the goalpost be moved next?

Sounds like you're bagholding calls
This sub has gone down in quality. All the GME apes sadly also jumped TSLA.. where are all the under the radar plays? We’ve been infested with Tesla fanboys.
There will be lots of trolls when the market goes straight up. Remember, they were quiet without a clue for 6 weeks 🧸🥰

Yes. Child porn should be censored. It’s distribution is a felony.

I don’t think truth is worth anything. I also didn’t and still don’t think gme is worth much. But gme is 10x what it was when I first started tracking it. SEC says it mostly went up because positive sentiment. Truth founder has legions of followers many with deep pockets who would have positive sentiment about whatever he put out even if it’s not worth much. So hopefully this blows up even more and hopefully I get in it in time

$FB 0dte FD's looking cheap, you know it's going to move one way or another.
Did You know only less than 1% of the population is born with red hair and blue eyes?? Now half of those are men ( maybe less with the 100000 genders now ) then you gotta think how many of those less than half a percent are hot, and even less are gonna have big tits. Those girls be very rare
Donny pump for emperor
$TSLA is the red-headed stepchild of tech with their fake FSD, never delivering on deadlines, weak growth, weak margins and shitty quality.

But somehow all the geeks thinks he’s hot.
This is irony at its best. The point of truth Twitter is because mango and his supporters got banned because people disagreed with them, so they create their own platform that isn’t overly censored so they can’t get banned when people get offended from a tweet
Damn I thought this was funny and something 🥭 would do to erk them. Tough crowd. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)

Myocarditis has a higher chance of occurring from a COVID infection. Not from the poke. You sound like that kid athlete from tik tok that blew up when he got it from the jab. 

These risks are known. And treatable when they occur in extremely low chances. They also largely prevent the worst side effects of COVID. Death. 

Anarchy. Cool. Well, because of people sharing your same sentiment, going to be 4 more years of dems in power pushing more vaccination policy.
I don’t even use Snapchat anymore… last time I opened the app was 2017

What about phunny ware?
you got a hard on for jeff bezo we got it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
truth twitter is going to fail as soon as they start mass banning anyone who slightly criticizes mango. how is this not obvious?
Wait so Snap is a data/ads company that can't gather data to sell to advertisers?

How much runway do these guys have?

Should be fine.
Hold them till you retire, or you find a better company. That's the best case scenario. The worst case scenario is hold till you really need the money for something important.
I don’t care about anyone’s political stance as long as you make me money
Now he has a stock 🙂
Exactly. And do boomers even buy options? Going to keep moving up. Wait til the magas get ahold of it. I’m buying more at open
Yes!! kept commenting on people buying calls or options telling them this exact thing. I didn’t play Snap but that’s the same reason why I’m bearish. It kept surprising me when snap kept climbing during the first tech bull run
Do people here look like they can afford Amazon calls? You answered your own question
Only thing I’m looking forward to tomorrow is buying some mango. Not really much else to look forward to nowadays. Might even buy 1k worth around open (which I see as a lot). Don’t have much to lose at this point if it goes down so why not
Market was way more exciting with mango man in charge
that's false, tho. AMD is buying back shares and has super low debt.
Lol no. Just saying they’re being beat. Not that the market isn’t irrational.

Unpopular opinion : Deep down even the people who claim not to like him, like him in some manner
Eat that mushroom bacteria stuff that makes your balls grow.. apparently it’s been clinically proven across multiple studies to make ur balls grow like 30% … but it doesn’t affect testosterone or anything so there’s really no point, unless you just want larger balls for the aesthetic
Let’s go Brand on
Eh wtf I was up many points before I went to take a shit half an hour ago
Bad idea either way. People want to convince you that it'll keep running but it'll get real ugly
What's this mango everyone keeps talking about?
Remember when most of this sub was using TA to predict the next market crash 14 days ago? 

This is why I’d rather have one of you fuck my wife than take advice from you
Absolutely not. Tesla? Lol
The stock market was so dynamic back then.
Alec Baldwin pulled a Brandon Lee on someone? Sheesh
Honestly I'm impressed they make money at this point. Meanwhile their ads are so annoying I close the app for awhile as soon as one shows up
That man has literally been president before. I think randomly winning the presidency would be better than having a SPAC pop
I love it! Should I dump it at a certain price or hold long is the thing I need to figure out now.

Everyone saying snap gonna go up so I'ma inverse

SNDL, just purchased 700 call options for $2.
Yes, AMD and TSLA are among the best growth companies out there right now.
Yeah you should definitely buy puts on TSLA let me know how it goes
I said that three times but kept buying against all judgement and it kept going. Going to keep happening
Facebook is a money machine. Tesla is a Wish product.
This is not a political post. 

But I kinda miss mango after what it did to the market today
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
The amount of pointless comments about this mango shit is ridiculous, reminds me of GME hype. It went up 400% in a day and that’s crazy and all but half the people commenting probably got in after 20 or 30 and made 200-300% tops, many of them probably made less. And you can’t buy options on it, so nobody made more than that.

Like yeah it’s awesome to get a 3-4 bagger but there was less excitement than this the other day when AMZN calls at open turned out to be like 100 baggers or some crazy shit. I don’t understand

Lol Snap call buyers why are you so bullish on a app like Snapchat
&gt; I have shares at average price 100 I'm thinking of averaging up. I can see it hitting 130, but the company has a lot of debt and will likely need to raise more capital soon.
Truth Social should come up with a feature to repost other users' posts. They could call it Real Talk, or RT for short. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
$AMD, I have some shares at average price 100 I’m thinking of averaging up I can see it hitting 130 it just hit 120 in after market. Should I average up?
Ya. Mine dumped me after I suggested it. Good luck.

Also I'm a Bernie Bro so gtfo here with that. I'm an anarchist at this point tbh
*Do it*
&gt; I would say that's because they're more focused on research and development than production.
Fun fact: according to fruit bois TSLA is second to none and years ahead of competition, but only growing 50% wat? Also being outsold by WV, Volvo, Audi, BMW and many more in the EV space. Lol
Less than 35 million shares I think

Nah, the retards who got censored will 1000% agree that shit like child porn and terrorist communication networks should be censored, they just don't like that they got lumped in with the pedophiles and terrorists. If you really believe in 100% censorship free free speech then there would be absolutely zero limitations on what is shared there and that's a dumbass idea.

Zing!
Mango had the best day ever. First he gets access to hundreds of millions and then Alec Baldwin got fucked. You know he's sleeping tight tonight.
Ticker, please?
Won’t matter going to keep moving. Room to run for a while. Only starting, once more people catch wind of it. Very small number of shares.

When can we sell?
PayPal owns Venmo, maybe you knew that already
This kid was you looking at all the jocks
So, how many of you haven’t got laid in months and use your gains from options to feed your already deteriorating ego?
The new vaccines are totally bunk, go look at the project veritas vaxxed series. They have jnj and Pfizer scientist on camera saying not to take them.

Sounds like she said yes without saying yes
I could see it based on today. I think day 2 the shorts will come out but at the same time even more people will be aware of it. It could keep running up in PM though to set a high floor. Again, I'm aiming for 100+ based on pure emotion.

Also like I've commented before some people get their paychecks Friday and may just instant deposit them straight into this ticker lol
yeah just 300 B to go. No biggie

Lmao, so when they start censoring anyone anti-mango and child porn, who do you think will be doing it? Admins living in their dad's attic? What you really mean is that you agree some things like child porn should be censored, you're just angry you retards got lumped in with the pedophiles and terrorists.
Goya beans
You too. Thanks for the tip. I just added it to my watch list and will definitely dig deeper.

What is the VIX on mango?
"Vaccines don't work and Mango won the election" aren't opinions, they're literally proven lies that lead to people dying. "Big government is good vs big government is bad" is an opinion and you are free to say that shit as much as you like.
This actually made me laugh

You are correct. Already dumped them from my second account. On the primary, got in at 10.70 and out at $15. All in at $20. I tolerated the dilution initially since employees are cashing out, but yeah, at some point this $23-$24 range becomes pathetic. I hope they change their ways soon.

I remember how funny it was when it didn’t have android support, so friends went and got iPhones….. god early Snapchat days were wild.
how to explain to my girlfriend that making $600 every 2 weeks, while possible on occasion, is not consistently feasible with an account worth about 12k atm. Damn bitch like I been trying and I'm up like 70% all time but it's a grind with a tiny ass account that shit isn't sustainable to pull days where I go up 1K
They're going to be forced into starting to sell...something.

No way Apple is gonna back track on ads. So will people give money to snap for "premium" features?
I bought puts yesterday and within a night got 15% profit also as per post market it went down again 3.57%
GME will never break 300 again, ever
If you make it like ghey the algos won’t catch it, carry on boss

There is never any pop media bullshit on any scale that gets posted in this sub unless it relates to a stock. Netflix and Chapelle for example.

What is going on with all these mango comments?
[deleted]
Not gonna guarantee it, but I think it goes on another day. Probably not much more than $70 or $80 EoD but who knows at when the whales get to play with it.

Edit: conservative (pun intended) predirctiom. Hope it soars
Let’s hope Tesla tanks in the morning so I can sell my puts and then recovers and bust through 900 for you Hahha
&gt; I get it.
Wym?
The fact that it didn’t shed any of its 1mo 20% gains, or or 5 day 10% gains. Usually such a rise causes a drop after earnings. When it doesn’t, that’s notable.
What do you think warrants are? 🥭warrants give you the right to buy a share at $11.50 strike with a five year expiry. That’s why they are up 4,568% since yesterday by the close. So you are kind of clueless.
does melatonin give you crazy dreams?
Like the MW2 days
How many mypillow commercials
150 tomorrow
EV demand is growing fast. Also, a lot of company owned trucks are only used within a city. $3K annual gas saving is enough for the bean counters to consider an EV pickup truck.

Same here 20 calls

You're fat and gay
Let’s go Donald duck!! Let’s go ! Feel like I’m going to a yankee game.
I don’t think so . When they come out with the lightning the demand will be thru the roof if they can keep up with production stock will go up
Some people just want to talk about vaccines, 2020 election, etc. without billion-dollar tech giants breathing down their necks.

Don't get me wrong though, it's probably more fun with some N-bombs
The man pumped BEANS.  Fucking BEANS.  What do you think he will do to his own stock.
ya i was looking at earlier dates and it's actually gone up on misses before. sometimes way up.
yOu R nOt AlLoWeD tO hUrT mY FeElInGs 😂
Literally every time I added more today it went up. Not saying it will tomorrow but I had the same thoughts and kept double/tripling down.

Nothing wrong with making money. But these same retards going "free speech" will suddenly change their tune when child porn gets passed around on there. Then they'll be like "we didn't mean that kind of free speech!" Same with ISIS communication networks or people calling Mango a dumbass. What they really mean is that they want a safespace to be able to say whatever they want but nobody else.
Why do you think they police the content posted on their platforms? It’s so they can make money advertising numb nuts. You know. The only way these companies make money. 

🍊 will make no money advertising because of the unsavory content. Also because🍊 followers advertising consists of beer, guns, and fast food. No need to market to these dumbasses. Those ads are always running 24/7 on Fox News and the sports programs they’re all boycotting. This shit is dead in the water.
I thought PayPal was buying Pinterest at $70/share. Is this free money?
🥭 is a sick mofo posting that pig picture.
i'm not so certain it's going down. it's gone up on misses before.
Mango is going parabolic. Buy every dip.

&gt;This [Easy Mango Dipping Sauce](https://homecookingmemories.com/easy-mango-dipping-sauce/) is fresh and fruity! Pair it with *chicken tenders*, fried shrimp, grilled fish — or anytime you want tropical flair added to your meal.
You don't have to be a SNAP bull to know that 25% was a wild over-reaction. Easy swing trade opportunity here.
I love $PLTR as a company. I brought in 12’s and sold around 23. I’ve become more of a value investor and don’t follow hype anymore. They keep diluting shares which shows to me they don’t respect shareholders. But they’re an amazing company. Will defo look to buy some if it falls below 7-10 if it ever gets there. Love the company, hate the stock
Imagine thinking all EV's are going to be the same "luxuriousness"/price range and not a multitude of different levels at different prices like gas cars are now
Go to bed son… I’m gonna rail you’re mother like a train with these black guys that just knocked on the door

**[Tay (bot)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_\(bot\))** 
 
 &gt;Tay was an artificial intelligence chatter bot that was originally released by Microsoft Corporation via Twitter on March 23, 2016; it caused subsequent controversy when the bot began to post inflammatory and offensive tweets through its Twitter account, causing Microsoft to shut down the service only 16 hours after its launch. According to Microsoft, this was caused by trolls who "attacked" the service as the bot made replies based on its interactions with people on Twitter. It was replaced with Zo.

Thanks. Looks like you know your stuff. 

So, last year it was $TSLA, $ROKU and $PLTR. 

Got out of the first two since they peaked. ROKU especially once they ended their HBOMAX dispute. They hit $420 but nowhere to go. 

Now I am all in PLTR. I might add more but need to see where the inflation is headed.
Wow it’s a horizontal shift.
People have been disposed of for less.
Sounds like 4chan with extra steps.

This bot is unreal lol
My to do list for tomorrow:

Sell SOFI and MARA at open

(Hopefully) watch BABA, AMD, and ATH all go up
 🍊 will keep rising for a while. Emotions and politics to the side. So many will keep piling in that feel their voice was not heard (right or wrong) and the crazies will also pile on. He can motivate his base as we have seen in the past. I’m gonna make more green off the orange. I’m here to make money! Buying more at the open

But like that's the thing about free speech. 

It's more the fact that any dissenting opinions are being censored and everything has become an ad and half the "people" on these platforms are bots pushing corporate agendas.

And on and on, but sure I must be a racist redneck hur durr
All I hope for is $AAPL not shitting the bed at open but not face ripping past $150. Now next week, though. Next week I want to see $160+

&gt; I didn’t think it was worth the risk.
No one talking about Evergrande?  I've been hearing it was this harbinger of the end of the global economy for so long.  It's kinda nice to have something positive so far.
What's your reasoning? I highly doubt that. The F150⚡ doesn't really have competition aside from Rivian for all of next year at least. The worst thing about ford was the charging network but with Tesla opening their supercharging network to other manufacturers that's gone. I'm betting after the F150⚡, there will be an EV bronco, and an F150⚡ Raptor announcement will shoot them well past 20.
Why didn’t you go all in pre market today?
Good movie on Amazon or Netflix for me to watch rn as I go to bed? Ty

I really have a tough time seeing where the f-150 lightning fits into all this anyway. 
Like practically speaking, why would anyone who needs a truck go with an electric one? Why not just get the proven models. 
I doubt contractors are gonna go for this one so it's really just a small niche of people who want a truck and want to also make it electric? 
Idk. I agree with you though, it won't dent Tesla's numbers.

It’s so overvalued and there’s definitely more downside than upside. So it’s kind of an easy short term short. And no It won’t be a big pos, just a small one and will probably double down if it hits 1500-2000. If not, easy few grands

Hey rodrigo how’s my ass taste
I'm not going to touch it, but I'd absolutely go broke dumping those bags at a loss.
Rust is described on IMDb as a Western, the story of a 13-year-old boy in 1880's Kansas who, charged with protecting himself and his little brother after the death of their parents, "goes on the run with his long estranged grandfather after he's sentenced to hang for the accidental killing of a local rancher."

This is actually a really good take and something I’ve thought about many times myself.
Averaging +5% every week for over 5 straight weeks now, $F is fucking awesome
Don’t get me wrong. I’ll say it once again. Fabulous company. But how can anybody justify the valuation it has right now? Barely makes a profit. Ramping up production is shown in history to be a very hard thing also.

It makes sense… if you think Tesla will sell 20 million cars a year and have a third of the global market share by 2030. The German brands will declare bankruptcy because they can’t compete with Tesla, and every city will have a giant fleet of robotaxis.  🤡
Next he’ll be trusting Vox media with anything that isn’t Apple news.
Even though im long Tesla with 500 sharws, im praying Tesla goes down tmrw so I can sell some naked puts. Premiums suck right now.

Msft calls. 310-315 expiry nov enjoy. Buy it soon tmrw because rebound. 


Same for V. 5% OTM. But watch Amex earnings. If Amex bad then V might take contagion.
It is the right to buy a share for $11.50 when talking about SPAC’s. it is like a call option with five year expiry and $11.50 strike.
I know you complain about not getting girls and then gets pressed over someone who don't reciprocate your oily advances 💀
It’s like a really long dated call option (with some important quirks, ask your wife’s boyfriend). Each of their warrants entitles you to buy a share at $11.50.

Check the same ticker with a W at the end. 

There are also units which is a share and some amount of warrant(s) as a package. Same ticker, but add a U.

Nobody can justify teslas valuation. It’s all overhyped assumptions. Go check intel, oracle back in 2000. Some internet companies still hasn’t returned to their ath even though they’re amazing companies. That’s the thing. Tesla is an amazing company, but the valuation is absurd.

New social media site that Mango says will take on Big Tech is just a half assed forked version of open source social media platform Mastadon with some branding removed. Violates their license agreement right off the bat lmao.







How about the Special Purpose Acquisition Company its trying to merge with? Led by a guy with a fake sounding name who uses a gmail account for business and lives in Wuhan China.

How are those other Mango supported free speech platforms like Parler doing? There's a million red flags here.
What thing
When you're a multimillionaire getting paid to road trip across the country with your hot girlfriend and end up murdering her and running away and dying in a shitty swamp in Florida 🤡🤡🤡

Cash secure puts on Alec Baldwin
TSLA poooots
So instead of special effects they had Alec just straight up blast people on set, doesn’t get more real than that, can’t wait to watch
Just gives it legitimacy, deserved or not. And the fact they didn’t figure that out over the years is shocking.
Big dick on the table
Rotation into growth. The memes will fly again
I'm holding PINS for earnings. I think it pulls a surprise and goes up bigly. Remember PINS actually beat on ARPU last time, unlike SNAP. And since no guidance on users this time around, it can't even "miss" really.
All this is fine but you can’t cuck Zuck 😤😤

That’s fourth law of thermodynamics

It'll probably just be dumped on Netflix where we will forget all about it, and then in five years it will randomly pop up and we will all say "oh yeah, Alec Baldwin intentionally shot his own employee in cold fucking blood to make this movie"
Gmo advancements have enabled mangos to stay fresh for longer though

Ah. Ya I figured this would happen. Didn’t think it would be that bad though because I don’t understand how they actually track. But I figured it wouldn’t hurt FB as much since they track their user as a user anyways and have isn’t and FB to link them, nor MSFT because ads are small (?) part of revenue. 


Could hurt Twitter though ? And PINS? Or not really

Still, as a gun owner: Don’t point gun and pull trigger where you don’t want to shoot.
How was a "prop gun" able to kill someone?
[deleted]
WHAT DO THEY MEAN
There's no projectile on the end of a blank round.  Its supposed to be a cartridge primer and small amount of powder.  Just enough to cycle another round, thus they are much shorter and if a live round was loaded into a prop gun, the slide wouldn't cycle and it would jam.

Which is why I think the studio will be sued to oblivion because they probably didn't use prop guns

You honestly come off like the type we would want to avoid.
Friday morning to do list: FOMO plays and don’t have an exit strategy.
&gt;improperly-made dummy rounds, cartridges from which the special-effects crew had removed the powder charges, so in close-ups the revolver would show normal-looking bullets. However, the crew neglected to remove the primers from the cartridges. At some point before the fatal event, one of the rounds had been fired; although there was no powder charge, the energy from the fired primer was enough to push the bullet into the gun barrel, where it got stuck (a condition known as a squib load). For the fatal scene, which called for the revolver to be fired at Lee from a distance of 3.6–4.5 meters (12–15 ft), the dummy cartridges were replaced with blank rounds, which contained a powder charge and primer, but no bullet, allowing the gun to be fired without the risk of an actual projectile. When the blank round was fired, the bullet lodged in the barrel was propelled forward with almost the same force as if the round were live

Nah prop guns are chambered smaller than a live round, and also have other safety mechanisms so a real round can't be accidentally loaded into them, specifically to avoid this.

So they either used real guns with a bunch of idiots who have no reason to be touching them, or someone shoved some shit in the barrel idk.

Am i understanding this correctly? If the warrants allow you to purchase a share at $11.50 and the price per warrant is $21.01 then your purchase price is $32.51 per share which lags the stock price significantly, currently $65.55.

New Business Idea: Company that sends crews to movie sets to check if the prop guns have live amo. 

- Prop Or Not, Inc. Call us before you shoot!
Prop guns if they aren’t checked properly can cause a blowout, think about the barrel blowing up… one of the few reasons where I can think of multiple casualties that didn’t include the “shooter”

Amongst all the jokes I’m guessing Baldwin is actually really fucked up seeing what happened. The woman was the lead photographer who wouldn’t have been point blank or even in the direct view. More than likely barrel blew out
I know a lot of of stocks. 
I know some of the best stocks.
Lol. I do t expect it either, but buying 100c is the true WSB way! But in all honesty, you don’t have to wait for it to go to 100 to make money. If the delta is more than theta you can profit off the movement. 

I believe PYPL will be fine, provided it’s not dumb and buys PINS.
I’m going with the 910c so if you see it go to 870 know I’m hurting

My dad coached my little league team when I was a kid.  I never actually cared about baseball, but my dad loved it.  I was the only boy my parents had so naturally I was pushed to play.  One day, my dad picked up from school mid-day and took me to a Mariners game.  We were in the nosebleeds, and never even got 50ft close to a catching a ball.

As we walked out, a man gave my dad a signed Ken Griffey Jr. ball.  That man was Bill Gates.  It was an incredibly day for me, but also for my dad who worked a blue collar job at Microsoft.  They are going to bury me with that ball, my $MSFT shares, and a photo of my first dog Maple.
That is like some Brandon Lee shit or maybe he pulled a Dick Cheney on that women.

Also holy shit Alec is absolutely distraught. I feel sorry for the guy.

First of all, I gotta say a big thank you to everyone who gave insights into the credit repair job of the hacktivist "ROYALBLADE". I tried out of faith in the success stories I've read here and on YouTube about the expertise of this dude. I’m so glad I did as I've just witness a good day in my life.

Too many questions to determine anything at this point. But I’ll say this as a gun owner: prop or not I’m checking if it’s loaded each time first thing before I pick it up.

Trump making me money even outside presidency
One of them was struck in the shoulder and another one in the stomach. Makes sense to me, when you stand behind someone who’s sitting down your abdomen is right at shoulder level of the other person.
You can wheel it but the 10% drop on paypal and 25% on snap will still hurt whoever wrote put options extremely. It's going to take a long time to recoup what was loss.
&gt; I'm not going to get into the specifics of my trading. I am a professional trader and it would be unethical for me to disclose that information on a public forum like this without permission from my firm's compliance department.

And you're on here? Dear god run away
I think you forget that the Facebook stock does not just represent “Facebook”. They’ve acquired 91 companies (instagram, WhatsApp, oculus, etc.). Tell me another company that snap owns that’s worth over $1b. I’m waiting.
And that’s all good but anyone thinking it’s going right back to 70+ is dreaming right now. Look at PINS when it imploded months ago? Just finally got back up and it imploded again…
#you’re not my real mom, and daddy only likes you because you have yuuuuuuge tiddies
Dude because I don’t think it should spy will open up like +.35% hit .5% before tapering off
Quite the opposite. You can roll out those puts + selling calls in attempts to salvage the trade. Or you can just hold on and let Thera decay work in your favor. As long as you weren’t a fucking muppet and sold a bunch of puts you should be fine.

Or you can even take assignment and write cover calls if you sold puts.
Ooooh spooky
What about Alex Baldwin manslaughters?
I clicked that expecting to see anime titties, but this is reddit, so I don't know what I was thinking.
Booze and weed and some yip and opening a new storefront at work. Hopefully I score some acid. Maybe some stocks but I have bigger fish to fry this weekend. DRUGS! DRUGS! DRUGS!
I can’t believe Alec Baldwin shot Joe Rogan. RIP
my gourd stocks are fucked if mangos keep going up
Fucking Drumpf does some magic spell and suddenly everyone's bullish. Actually, come to think of it, it makes sense.
Prolly diluted now is my guess —-&gt; why miners are options only.

Thanks for the advice everyone. Mangos are trading at a steep discount right now and I’ve loaded up on futures contracts on Forex for the spring.

Long fb and snap overnight , short qqq and spy, anyone feel me?

**[Brandon Lee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Lee)** 
 
 &gt;Brandon Bruce Lee (February 1, 1965 – March 31, 1993) was an American actor, fight choreographer, and martial artist. Establishing himself as a rising action star in the early 1990s, he landed his breakthrough role as Eric Draven in the dark fantasy film The Crow (1994). Lee's career, however, was cut short by his death during The Crow's production. He was the only son of martial artist and film star Bruce Lee, who died when Brandon Lee was eight years old.

No one will be talking about it 2 weeks from now
How’re markets gonna react to black swan event that is Baldwin murder?

I think it’s bullish tbh and tomorrow we rocket to new ATH
Probably 470
But their logo is so shiny
So AAPL is going to change their tune? 

Because unless they do….
Well I thought PYPL was a safe bet so I didn't get spreads and I'm down like half a grand.

Need it to jump back to 270 before 11/5..

I don't trust people batman arrests.

Earlier this summer, my girlfriend and I stayed at an Air BNB in Austin.  The place had a $PRPL mattress.  When we laid out heads down for the night, our souls left our bodies, drifted into outer space for the night, and returned in the morning.  For a moment in time, every tidal wave on Earth was synchronized with the beats of our resting hearts.  My wife is entering the second trimester, thanks $PRPL for the greatest sleep of our life.

Yea there are tons of misleading "financial news" headlines and social media chatter about insider ownership where people have no clue what they are talking about. I sifted through a lot of this stuff on PLTR so I know what to look for now. Between reading the SEC form 4s and understanding beneficial ownership, and also cross-referencing with the S-1 (which often touches on current and future executive compensation), you kind of get an idea of the real insider ownership. It's pretty complicated usually for companies that recently went public
Yup, go ahead and open up. Cry about your lost tendies, so that we can make u feel better.

15 days to slow the spread
News the night before + searching if the other company mentioned was publicly traded. Only some articles did actual journalism and mentioned the involved SPAC though
best place to look is here: https://www.secform4.com/filings/1477333/0000899243-21-040880.htm

if you go down to table 2, you get an idea for how many shares he holds by adding up what's in column 9 that has a unique footnote. There are rules for when certain options start counting as beneficial ownership, so it may be incomplete. But that's sort of the minimum amount of shares he owns. something like 35M shares
Dude What A Cunt
About 3 years. Biggest single winner has been GME. Cleared over $115k during the meme run. TSLA has also been a big winner. Bought in during last March's crash and have been holding and adding to my position since. Currently up over ~$135k with it.

Guidance my friend
Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.
Baldwin would 100% not be held responsible. If anyone it would be the prop master, if they were to go after individuals and not the production company. No one would though. No one went to jail for Brandon Lee’s death.

The DA debated charging the production company, but decided against it.

In the middle of the longest bull market in the past 16 months and I sit on the sideline holding shares.

Decided to jump in on calls FINALLY and two genius tickers I picked were PYPL and SNAP at open.
I hope so, premium will be dank
[deleted]
25andME
Crazy to me that SNAP beat estimated EPS by 117% and missed estimated revenue by 2.91% and sold off 20%+. Seems like a massive, massive buy the dip opportunity.
But, like how did he shoot TWO people if the gun misfired?!?
Yeah tomorrow, i’ll upload my gain porn.
So we’re all in on MAGA huh
Will MANGO have options soon
I need financial advice. What will net me 100% gain tomorrow?

Why arent CNBC futures loading today? https://www.cnbc.com/
DM 2024 calls are $270 roughly each for 7.5 strike. Seems that you could buy those as a less risky bet that it will rise eventually and expand the time horizon some. Not financial advice and this could very well be a penny stock. Just throwing that out there.

Wtf why
🥭 futes trading at over 100 👀
Lol threw like 5k into warrants and shares at close and I’m already up almost 100%. Maga boys be rabid
He exercised all of his options, from my understanding
Not to bad !
Frankly, I don't care. Ma has almost nothing to do with BABA anymore other than being a shareholder.
Who's this "Cook" you speak of? I only know of Tim Apple.
There are no accidents
Blanks still expel gas out the muzzle. If you hold it up to your head it'll still kill you.
Is this Alec Baldwin’s karma for trolling 🥭? Can’t be a coincidence between these two characters today. The universe is strange.
I did in the 11's, 100 shares, I'll hold until options and start selling calls when it cools down
Wouldn’t you make sure there wasn’t lodged bullets in the chamber tho?
Sigh 

After a year of SPAC shorts feasting, here we are loading up another one with both hands 🤡

Digital advertising revenues fell for Snap, which scared investors in other stocks where it's an important part.

Goog, FB, and TWTR.

There could be others, but those are the ones I saw.
Because it’s gone up a lot lately. Across 16-20 isn’t there good of a sign.

That must be frustrating
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/theCramps (0/1) made a bet that FB would go to 345.0 when it was 328.75 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Facebook has acquired 91 companies 
Snapchat has acquired 17 companies

Instagram as a stand-alone company might be worth more money than snap. 

Facebook is undervalued at 20x next years sales
Snapchat is overvalued at 23x next years sales 

Facebook has already been punished for apples advertising iOS updates (this is the second fucking time)… snap was unscathed.

Conclusion: FB calls 🤌

Holy mother of mango why did I not buy more
What kind of retard has live rounds in a prop gun on a movie set
Why SPY $460 tomorrow is guaranteed.

1. Evergrande bailed out (don’t @ me with “it’s “PrIcED iN” look at fucking Hang Seng YTD. Shit would be past or 1-2% to ATH. This is China’s debt ceiling basicially. So important, financial recession on the line)

2. Bank earnings - bullish AF

2. Hang Seng Green

3. FOMO of SPY

4. Non priced in SPY movement of Biden’s Trillion dollar+ bills

5. TA analysis upwards trend 

6. Other earnings will be great reporting in the morning

7. FED buying more SPY shares who were busy before market close

Edit: ahhh wait I thought you meant before apes invaded 🥭 instead of the entire sub... but undoubtedly they will get after mango after it's shorted to all hell
I need Nike to take a dump tomorrow just loose half it’s gains from today like maybe just a bad day in the whole market to feel safe from the 7 days in a row of gains

It was right after her husband died and now he never sees her, makes her pay all the taxes and insurance, and is going to sell her property and take all the money when she goes.
He would have a lot of political backing to prevent that

In order to be born, you needed:

128 fifth great-grandparents
256 sixth great-grandparents
512 seventh great-grandparents
1,024 eighth great-grandparents
2,048 ninth great-grandparents
 
For you to be born today from 12 previous generations, you needed a total sum of 4,094 ancestors over the last 400 years.

Yes.  It was priced in.  It’s already been known the CCP wasn’t going to let it collapse.  That’s why no one has been talking about it as a problem the past few weeks.  It still doesn’t change the property issues in China or their regulatory crackdowns or their own inflation issues or their general slowdown in economic activity.  ATHs is laughable for them right now.
How could you not be all in on mango social stock...
28.75M float, 74M people voted for 45. Don't care what your politics are, you have to be an idiot to not figure out this is retirement money coming.
If it goes down can I yell at you? Merger is definitely priced in.

Get in tomorrow then. This still has room to pop tbh.

No way.  The fundamental problems in their property market haven’t change just cause one company scrapped up enough money to make one bond payment.  Not officially defaulting tomorrow was priced in

Money is saying, “we love money”. I hate the bumbling fucking idiot of a Sean Hannity addicted boomer. But I’m in. 

And I’ll be out when you’re still holding the bags saying you love Trump. Long after you figure out the CEO’s physical address is in Wuhan China and his contact info is a gmail account, after you figure out there was no business plan, no proprietary technology, and nothing of value but his names draw to the magahats. Long after all of that, that you’ve tried to rationalise away and ignore like all his other failings, and your money is gone like your donations that never went to the advertised endeavour. 

And the money will say, “Not my problem”, having already moved on to the next gig.
That's the only way I do it and always sell puts to get shares

Yeah idk - there is no tech, they just reskinned an open source platform (and may have violated the useage agreement).  As far as having a real stock - there are a lot of scam SPACs. There are no offices - the company address is a Miami WeWork shared space.
When I buy shares it must be in 100 increments , the only stock I can't buy in 100 increments is AMZN and BRK.A
It’s just going to dump on earnings 😂

Natural immunity is immune system 101 and people got fired with proof of natural immunity even though first year med students could tell you that's regarded.

AMD is the move. Always has been and always will be.

Given the run up to earnings, you can argue a earnings beat is already priced in.

However, Intel doing bad is likely bullish for AMD. 

Even if it retreats a little post earnings, the next catalyst  would be merger announcement which is expected to be announced Dec/Jan.

So I'm going to hold my position through earnings. Not even planning to sell covered calls. Got destroyed having to buy them back last earnings.

Wait I’m missing something. What’s with all the fruit?
Bro that’s your personal evaluation. But in reality it’s not overvalued, it’s undervalued. Secondly their products are exactly the same like Invisalign and on top of that they are affordable and convenient to order from home, dental offices or SmileShops (their own shops). They are opening more and more stores in the US and internationally. Expanding their partnerships with local dental offices. Their products are available in Walmart, Target, etc. Recently they announced their SmileBus which goes from cities to cities around the country offering their services…. Check out and read some DD before you talk shiit about SDC. 💎🦷🙌

it's a 1bn dollar stock. Mackenzie Bezos could buy the whole thing, take it private, and turn it into the Super Inclusive Safe Space Channel for Underprivileged Puppies and Kittens.

And then she could buy the Trump organization. Dozens of times.

If people want to hold a price war over which political party is better, I think they should bid competitively on my 1993 Toyota Corolla, not on Trump's media org.
Was it a walk or a hike? Why did you walk for 5 hours?

Missed the trump pump, wonder if it will still run
They got into a little issue with Google. Yeah, that Google.
That's funny because I didn't think you could short it
There’s gotta be something with a mango on there right?… right?!
As our constitution clearly states, if the price of trump stock passes the price of SPY, trump becomes the president again. It's the law.

🥭: we shouldn’t view this as simply a pump. The way big tech has their viewers by the balls is concerning. Competition, from a different perspective, is in my opinion great for democracy

I told him the stock was prob gonna die into close and he said ok. I text him later and am like wow it’s at $72 in AH, he calls me and reminds me I told him about trump Warrants and he tells me he bought 5000 at close 😂 he was worried cause it dropped 10% the last 5 mins but now it’s up 100% AH

Lol. Remember though that lack of liquidity will make orders at the mark slow, which is why many people set limits to buy sell so much higher/lower than the actual mark in order to get filled quickly. Which is why AH candles look retarded.

So if you place an order an nothing happens it’s because liquidity is often low as fuck.

I made a little off of the 🥭 run today, really think this rocket will go further...but I'm just not touching it again.  This is a game of musical chairs, and the prize is one big bag with a lifetime warranty.  

On the other hand, I feel like the 🥭 faithful are gonna keep shares locked up for a long time, and they have rascal scooters, so they brought their own chairs to the game....

Typically these plays run atleast two days. I think we see a break above $100 then fade a bit
Facebook went to shit when they removed the poke feature
You have to pay attention to rising stocks both volume and %. Just check when you can.
Do you use trailing stop losses and what percentage do you set them at? I got kicked out of the 🥭 movement by setting it at 8%. I literally had finger on the cancel button as my shares sold

The news came out last night , you had fking 12 hours to prepare to buy at premarket , when it opened at 7am premarket for most brokerage there was heavy selling pressure which drop the price from 12.40 to 10.40 , I sold at the bottom because I thought the hype wasn't there , turns out I was just too early and most retards are just insanely late to the news. Missed out on massive gains oh well.......

Goddamn brutal, hearing the announcement makes your heart sink
28 m shares of mango float. Tiny
SNAP $49 and $50 puts had quite the day
You will bounce back King. Hang in there.
44% AH is nuts. I was scared because I forgot to sell before close, but I'm hopeful for tomorrow.
Probably, but Herman Miller carries insane resale value
A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica which is believed to have originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India.[
💦
It’s always this way, the one incessantly focused on this shit is the racist
I’d say 45 is the bottom
Because the calls dont adjust from AH action
Congrats and fuck you. I officially went red all time in my portfolio sooooo
TSLA 0dte calls take me to Valhalla
Typical
So did SNAP cause the dip in SPY?
There were actual retail investors who sold every stock they owned when Mango lost cause he said market would crash. There are a lot of people who would throw their life savings into Mango Man Stock because he's promising to take on Twitter, Facebook, Netlix, Amazon, etc. $1000 is NOT a meme
Think 🥭 is dumb but bought stock because maga boys are rabid and will pump this shit to the moon. I like my money and don’t care how I get it.
Limit order, and TIF as either EXT or AM.
I do too they only let you do [select securities](https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/after-hours-trading.html) PM or AH, zero of which are fun.
Just keep up it's not hard
Any particular Twitter worth following?
I have a current banbet so I can't. Do it again!
I crossed $600k in my portfolio today and I can't really share it with anyone else but y'all so just wanted to say thank you. This sub has literally changed my life.

Edit: Holy shit thanks for the gold!
Volatility
I think they're talking about mango futures, but I can't find them anywhere. Some super secret futures trading platform that's not allowed here or something.
If you work at a restaurant, I feel bad for you
Sigh. I first saw it at $39 and said I missed out. Now I’m hearing guys like you who want in at $70 plus.
Mission confirmed.
Sad a that I missed the Mango pump today. How do people get notified of this news so quickly? I need some sort of phone notification...
Yes it will be Parler2.0 … but not right away.  At launch it will skyrocket up the App Store ranks and probably keep surging.  Eventually people will get bored and delete it - plus trumps base is addicted to FB - they won’t leave because their non-MAGA family and friends are on FB

Stop shaming people. Have some heart. They can’t help it. They are victims and victims need to be cuddled and treated better then others. Now shut up and vaccinate yourself, family and pets! And de-friend all your friends who don’t agree with this.
I got a bit of a nostalgic flashback of 🥭 pumping the market. A single tear ran down my cheek.
If FB reports similar news in Monday it’ll implode more. 

Your call
*sends money to their collections. Partial payment. Mangos will rise
Over valued. That company sells trash.
🥭 is 🥭
Sure. Puts will probably print at some point, just think it’ll have a regarded run up first.
man so fat bear week really did end the recession huh? i shoulda listened to my own advice
#meantweets2024
Bruh 1DTE SPY 455 was obvious today. Gonna open ITM
Aoon
There’s no way 😭
🤮🤮🤮
No way its half as valuable as Snap. Snap does a billion in revenue a quarter. Advertisers care a lot abour younger demographics, thats where the money is.

Also the platform 🥭 is using is some open source shit that hackers are gonna have a field day with.

We dont even know the details of the merger or any kind of business plan or anything.

The special purpuse acquisition company its merging with is from China led by some guy with a fake sounding name using a gmail account for business. There are a million red flags as to why this will fall hard

And this is another example where much smarter people than yourself have it in place for a reason.
Fuck I wish I didn’t have an active banbet. Mango to a $1000 if options chain opens up.
presto chango
Every time I’m like I’m never buying a call again. The next day I buy calls
Yeppp
FB is priced for bankruptcy. Free money
That is a great last line for your book.
Counter point

They will consider pumping this stock to be a form of owning the libs
Like a pink sprinkled donut?
Why would anyone invest into anything other than Mango stock? Cancel the stock market, this thing will **never** go down, mango now IS the market.
Elon says let's go brandon
WHAT'S UP BOYS AND GIRLS
Anybody feeling some Big Mango energy gonna explode tomorrow?
They’ve already been hit with this same issue. Then hit by public sentiment on the 60 mins report. Then the snap drop. The stock is now trading at a low multiple

Honestly this is a better long term hold than GameStop. Repubs have been hating on big tech for years. This is a great time to put their money where their mouth is. Maybe we see a few of the big dogs in the senate or congress talking about moving over to this and it will fly.
Yes, we have, and I still maintain that the electoral college is a shit thing to have.

How many of you guys gonna short 🥭?
Why? SNAP just dropped 20%. FB may have similar issues.
#EVERGRANDE MAKES ITS PAYMENT THE MARKET IS SAVED
Bears chance today??
🥭 is 1/100th of SNAP valuation. i know where i am dumping my money
Only a complete retard still holding calls without taking profits
It's cause he doesn't give them over the pants hand jerbs
they generate wealth
Jokes aside I won’t be surprised if Elon got into it
I’ve already seen basically this exact quote used without irony
FB calls and shares tomorrow. EASY MONEY
Evergrande paid up where YANG gang at??
Google it. Shorting a stock is not options

 It'll probably be several years though.. I imagine it having a fancy name like " *FinTech* "
Who knows, market crazy as hell!
Lol like trading AH is some elite unobtainable status.
FUCK YES SPY 500 EOM
How?
Jppw speaks? Sweet Jesus sell everything
You make a great point. Maybe ill mix it up with shares here.
Yeah saw it at $19 and just assumed it would crash
Politics completely aside, seeing TSLA have this much success, it is wild to think that the White House snubbed Elon from an EV summit when he controls over half the EV market.
So SNAP calls Tom morning?
[deleted]
You retards actually think we’re in 🥭 for the long term? 😂
Getting drunk. Getting high. Watching Spy Kids 2. Shits garbage. It’s pretty good tho.
This has the potential to make GME look like SNDL, if you know what I’m saying…
Thankfully we are in a country where that’s the case… but there’s also an electoral college that can potentially trump the popular vote. So we’ve come full circle.
Dude my throat knotted. Holy fuck. So fucked
I smell bullshit. Sorry just not buying it.
Same here haha cheers
It’s smelling like A Make America Great Again day tomorrow
I won't buy under $80. Our president is worth at least $80 a share.
Deez nuts
I agree that it’s undervalued but it can stay that way for a while. A two day play on calls won’t have reliable multiple expansion to fair value. I’m just going to be buying shares here. Similar reason to why I bought baba shares during the crash instead of calls.
You can buy premarket you just need to change the order terms.
Foldy samsung phone is so wack imo

The tech is pretty neat and impressive tho
Possibly.

SNAP calls at open or wait a few days?
SPY
I literally saw it announced on Twitter yesterday and I set the buy order right then
Haha guaranteed. I bet its trending rn
He’s such a moroon.
I love a good mango BlackBerry smoothie
During GME every other stock crashed. Tomorrow same thing will happen. Everyone plowing into Mango Man stock
yep if you got money people will come money is the cure to everything
Are you dense? It’s past mars already 🤡
Rotation into 🥭
True.
People who get the vaccine should be comforted that they have it and it will protect them. People who choose not to get it should be allowed to do so with no discrimination but also have to live with any potential consequences. And honestly people who get it have the potential for consequences too
I put the tractor in the garage, fed the pigs, had a beer, watched Tucker Carlson and then heard the news, I'm in tomorrow for sure.
A lot of people are gonna buy puts

Well, the stock doesn't have options....unflaired one.
Options aren't even a thing on it yet so there goes puts theory
seething with jealousy. good shit bro what was the strike/exp? and can I have $20?
Appreciate you looking out 🤙🏽
Exactly. I’m here for the money.
Does anyone have some of that… presidential sharpie.. I need to pencil in some extra zeros for my portfolio.. commit to the **truth**!
Politics aside, its a meme nobody bought it for its value...like all memes it will die
😂
What happened to SPY AH?
!banbet Dodgers in 7
Just went to the grocery store.  Prices on mangos were up 360% since yesterday.  Thia inflation is getting out of control.
Sensing rotation into mango tomorrow
GOGGLE

Edit: I got edit sniped and now I look like a goof
Not gonna hold through earnings. But FB is now undervalued
Ofc it’s going to die but the profits I made today will live
K so put your life savings on that then?
People will go to TWTR to talk about 🥭
TLRY
January
Long term - yes 

Short term-🚀🚀🚀
Just wait n watch, elon is going to disclose in the next earnings call that he bought $1B of 🥭 stock and added $100b market cap to TSLA
It is for me
Remember when everyone starts Reeeing about a stock it's time to do the opposite
Please wait until after earnings or do a debit spread instead. I hate watching people get IV crushed through earnings. The report is Monday.
Gay as fuck we do options
Hey, what is a divs?
By literally shorting it
Just because they don’t match YOUR opinions doesn’t make them terrible.
[deleted]
Lmao
Even better bro the graphics are insane
I only want to get paid. I don’t care about anyone’s politics and safe spaces
Bias aside, here's why 🥭 stock will fail:

Trump followers don't really give a shit about discussing idealogical beliefs - they care about owning the libs. There will be no libs to own. The entertainment value will die quickly and so will traffic.

Puts on 🥭, calls on Twitter.
TSLA 1000c 10/22 is only $10. Literally free money! Can't go up tits!!
Horses require too much maintenance and aren’t as fast
There's a casino that's open 24/7 but most WSBers can't stomach it

Edit: also you spelled lose wrong fucking idiot
SNAP puts was there easiest money I’ve ever made
I don’t know why you automatically assume that I don’t know market cap. Yeah i get that, like same reason people asking why chipotle trades higher than AAPL?  I’m not talking about that
&gt; I'm in the front office of a hedge fund.
Mouth to Lung
Fuck ya all in!
position? Just wondering because I’m going all in on 🥭
I mainly use TD Ameritrade
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
!banbet 🥭 420.69 1w
Yeah losing all your money on a sketchy pump and dump linked to China will sure show them 🇱🇷
Probably frozen and glitchy
You know you can get the whole slab right?
I tried but I think you can’t
Yep. 4,000% if you bought the warrants.
One meme to rule them all
He pulled his people out of stimmy talk negotiations and spy dropped a couple percent only to pull a oh you fuckers misunderstood me and reversed it all in futures the same day.
&gt; no, money can't cure crippling loniness
Dow futures green when everything else is red…hopefully my BA calls pump tomorrow
Reminds me of the UPST guy. I can’t hear you, you’re breaking up.
Are they though? People will never learn to operate such complex contraptions
the ban is because you don't understand the concept of market cap. goodbye
That would be pretty neat
Close RH and move to a real broker
So money is supposed to cure crippling loneliness right?
So I heard I’m putting all the money I’ve been saving into MAGA stock is this true?
Same. Right wing nut jobs will get it shut it down within 3 months
Someone is gonna loose a lot of fucking money on 🥭 but fuck it, open the casino. I need my fix
 Fb and twitter are good ideas.  Just be sure to not actually hold through their earnings though
Haven't seen any 🥭 banbets? Do it! You won't.
$WISH me luck
So what are my chances of Mango coming on tv smoking a fatty like Elon.  Maybe then my TLRY would finally moon.  Damn it man.
Before the dip!
I call that today. He said tomorrow.
CNN : “Trump’s racist and manipulated stock strikes again!”
[deleted]
I love how literally everyone is talking about one stock and it can’t even be mentioned here. Tomorrow is gonna be crazy, I think we see $150
This stock is completely driven by news. If they get an emergency approval, the stock will moon, especially given how beaten down it is. At least that is what my smooth brain is telling me.
Massive liquidations to free up cash to go into 🥭. Could drop the whole market
&gt;same price as TWTR and SNAP

#BAN
I have no idea what MTL is or does but I bought 10 shares when I saw it trending one day and had some spare change so I said fuck it. I have been buying 10 shares weekly since then because it just keeps going up. I’m at 200 shares and am up 50%, still no idea wtf they do
THX PREZ as the license plate, too.
I believe so, but most of us can’t buy till 9:30 🥲
I watched it all day waiting for it to cool down...it never did. Still made a a few k from 36-51 but damn it could've been an insane day
Mango contango
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Property developer China Evergrande Group has made funds available for a bond coupon due Sept. 23 to a trustee account on Thursday, before the expiration of a 30-day grace period for the payment, a source told Reuters on Friday.

Total value trap.
It's also just inefficient and unattractive
Re enter
Everyone used their Biden bucks to buy trump bucks
Wish she still acted. She was great.
Burry and Cathie hate fucking while watching the mango live chart.
Problem is some people refuse to get vaxxed and then die. If you're in a position of power to change that and you're a decent human being that shits gotta weigh on your conscience right?
I weigh 320 pounds but your mom knows that already
yes but we couldn't gamble on it. if that blog allowed us to attempt to exploit trumps rube army it would be bigger than facebook
Bank earnings will send moon mission.
That was fun
Show us where SNAP touched you.

even a caveman would know about 🥭 after a 400% day like today
“MANGO MAN STOCK TALKS GOING GOOD “
Mango? The one that’s cheaper than coins? Lol
It’s not SNAP that broke the market, it’s the 🥭 stock, money that were parked in FB TWITTER SNAP etc rotated into that stock and now it trades around the same price as TWTR and SNAP in one day. 

I’m also high so…
Spy is back to where it fell 
Break through 457 or sell off??
$COIN is the proof to Fermat's Last Theorem.  It is the fountain of youth.  It is an eternal flame.  $COIN is the bumblebee that pollinated your wife's wedding bouquet.  It is a white tiger that uses humans as props in its magic routine.  Take a deep breath and let the waves crash into you.
I wish the real world were as smart as this community. My people fr 🤌

Yeah let’s just be 1/5th SNAP and close Monday at $675
These people can't read. Why link to an article?
Onto the next one
I'm trying
Remember how Mango would talk about the market and it would always go up last year! He was the best at calling the bottom.
Fat
Sounds like paper hands to me
Mango gango or Mang gang
I know this is a Trump and Dump and I don’t care.
That’s me all the time.  Now I just yolo
Pork belly is just thicc bacon
Somehow the media will report this as a Trump-led insurrection on Wall Street
just short it dawg
There will be many to follow. This will become an emotional political battleground and I love it
famous last words as every middle american blue collar family opens up their savings accounts to fomo into 🥭
Same here brother, I saw it at $18. Kicking myself but still a lot of potential
I think there was a sub created that was banned within 13 hrs.
That's not unpopular, square faces are just typically for more formal pieces at least when it comes to non smartwatches
🍆🥭😩
How can you short it? It just opened today and there are no options available.
Oct 12 hang seng was +1%, SPY ended -.5% 

Take it as you will

Being fat is bad for the environment. Not just a health issue. Stop being a glutinous fuck
Is 🥭 open to trade on premarket?
Who decides who is smart and stupid? And how do you measure that? Many smart people have terrible political beliefs, like Burry.
SNAP is $118b.. by that standard, 🥭 is way undervalued
Would sell my warrants so fast for calls
I’d say 35%, the MMS know it’ll run up a shit ton tomorrow and Monday so
I'm gonna buy calls day of earnings. I don't usually hold past ER, but FB is down so much that they gotta gap up. Unless they totally bomb it on Monday.
I'm going to go post this over there. I'll get banned but that sub is done now that it's concluded
So I hate to burst everyone’s bubble, but you realize Mango Man already had a “social media” platform of his own that shut down after 29 days because nobody read it right? Call me when you can buy puts on it.

Alright I have done my DD (take a guess as what DD stands for). We are going big on 🥭. I am sick of watching SPY turtle every day, gets so boring. We need some action in our lives.
Buy Mango stock! Its the future!
Booooooo
Mango
Saw SPY’s market close price, got stoked. Saw SPY’s current AH price, got depressed.

I was planning on selling at the end of the day, but then a co-worker came into my office just before 4pm and I got distracted. I'm nervous for tomorrow.
We're cool. Just watch yourself...

🍻
Keep telling yourself that.
It did very briefly but it got banned by admins. That's as much as I can say if I know what's good for me.
How likely is it for MM to have options for 🥭
It'll be very soon.
You have to use google dawg. Probably can test them out in all major cities.
GUYS sorry am late for the party. Got held up by some BOOMER work people. What is 🥭????
Wait until the SEC investigates it and flips it’s dick out
0DTE day tomorrow boys. Were legends are made and new Wendy's employees as well. Let's  get it 😤
🥭!
I have Embody. Its good.
You would love  in up here in New England.
Lmao I love those types of jobs
Nah, everyone's voice means something, even if they are idiots.
They are all meeting in the back rooms about to drop the hammer on starts with C ends with rypto.

That’s going to be the red-pill that chokes people all the way out.
Hold your tongue. He'll come back down to reality but who knows in the short term
They already did that when they unleashed the virus
How can it not? Have you even been watching it or just sour ya missed it 💋
Those packed with cash right?
Chaturbate is going public? Sheeesh they probably make shit tons of money
Government just wants people to get vaccinated to save lives. Dunno what correct call is...tough situation.
What does that have to do with anything? I genuinely have no clue what point you're even attempting to make.
I just watched *Dracula Prince of Darkness* (1966) with Christopher Lee, it was apparently the third movie in that Dracula series but I haven’t seen the first or second. Prince of Darkness wasn’t too bad though
Say it louder for the permabears at the back!
Anyone who thinks for themselves can see Biden is a puppet
#best part is hang seng is green and bank earnings tomorrow. $460 Gauranteed.
And once again, there’s plenty of people with all kinds of different beliefs, but the fact is, they’re dumb and or not important… therefor their voice doesn’t mean shit
If you feel sad about missing 600% gains on 🥭 , at least you weren't the person who trades on emotion and blew up their account by going short on 🥭 just because they hate him.
A buddy of mine just told me that his pastor texted him and said “should I buy trump’s stock”

BULLISH
Yh my spy puts r not looking cute
Pornhub
Yea, was so scared to leave it over night…. As I’ve been screwed in premarket one to many times
I get banned all the time. Those apes like me
Buying more HUT. I tried to tell you all to buy HUT many weeks ago. Most didn’t listen and you missed out on massive gains. I am now telling you again to buy HUT, but you will not listen again and will miss out on even more massive gains.
I bought a bunch of fds at the bottom of the first dip. Felt so smart for an hour

Mango stock is going to 1000. Its still early
I wish options were available for it.
mango man made me money when he was in power..still made me money when out. love that guy and miss his twitter pumps
It will be like Parler, lots of signups out of curiosity then abandoned.
Buy BB 🚀🚀🚀
MANGO is the financial derivative of the “Let’s Go Brandon” sentiment.
How things have been for 240+ years you mean.
Oh?
440.
Tell Remy I love him
....🥭?
Tried an embody last year, sent it back and got a staples memory foam office chair - way more comfortable
I have the Aeron. If you like to sit with one leg under the other just be mindful that you can't really do that with it since the plastic digs into your leg. Other than that it's nice.
Oh, like a bisexual…. Nice…..
Think we’ll get the morning pump on FCEL to offload the calls I bought at close?
Lol @ all the people who think mango is going to the moon tomorrow
Hehe noice
Everyone on Twitter is such a dumbass 

If you don’t let these worthless politicians cheat in the stock market, they won’t care about it at all. 

When they don’t care at all, you’ll start seeing insanely idiotic rules start getting passed about it, like taxes on unrealized gains. 

Why would they care.
Nope they haven't even started filming part 2 yet, waiting to see the box office on 1....weird thing, Stings character was completely written out
We are all on borrowed time
Tomorrow's discussion is about Bank of International Settlements. Shouldn't move the market too much.

haha, nice
I’m a mango man!
It will have 1% of the user base, and be worth 1% of real social media companies until Trump is gone at which point it will evaporate before our eyes
The entrepreneur mentality is a beautiful thing
Remember, all people who are spamming tickers already bought and are holders...they are not gonna buy...they are looking to sell
My time is coming
Who tf is Biden??? I think you mean Brandon?
Well I was at work all day, what the Facebook ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
percentage wise you kicked my ass
$GOMAN

Your arguments suck, bro. Please say something that makes sense.
Had a measly 36 at 12 and sold at 48….. had most of my cash in stupid calls 😡
Lol
Your risk level doesn't belong here.

Little bit of both. I like to play both sides and so on and so on….
HBO is owned by Warner who owns nearly everything lol I think zero people involved of making one movie were involved in the making of the other
Just wait until they get their paychecks and instant deposit that shit through RH
Nah he’s just excited he gets to eat this weekend
Who do you think you are bro?
Calls would've been lovely
28mil float that traded nearly 500 mil.
Yolo'd $20,000 into December $200 calls on $NVAX. Wish me luck.
Nah that’s the play.  It’s nuts to hold this spac - you might get another bite of the Apple FrIDaY bc people won’t hold over the weekend
Remember when circuit breakers actually existed? God I miss those times. They were mystical nights. Sleeping right next to a rope.
Holding over the weekend was some nerve racking shit though. Such a bizarre thing the difference between making and losing money is whether the president goes nuts on Twitter.
He’s talking to some bankers he’s not gonna say anything meaningful
Big hairy man
picked up 300 at 53. easy money
You have 🥭 🥭 of steel
Its gonna run. Buy more tomorrow bro!

I can’t tell if this is a compliment or a insult
Guess you’ll be keeping backup clothes at the office / in your car form now on
You obviously aren’t familiar with America then.
Been skinnin bucks and running trout lines
Getting paid to sleep, shit I get paid to sleep now but my boss doesn't know what he is paying for.
I missed the halts. Nothing like the suspense, even if they had to be shares instead of weekly calls
I wanna tell you it is but I honestly don’t know man. I’m only hoping so 🙏
$COIN $COIN $COIN this stock is like an undiscovered Beethoven symphony.  It is like seeing Halley's comet twice.  It is like playing with your childhood dog.  Take a sip of Cabernet Sauvignon and enjoy the ride.
Never tried an embody but I have the older model Aeron I bought and it’s the best chair I ever had. Worth every penny
Well hope we both get some good trades coming up
Yeah but you don’t need the flu shot to go to school. These mandates are stepping WAY over the line even though it truly is the correct thing to do in most cases. You just can’t force it.
My names not Carl, guy

You can get one half price at a used office furniture store
I hope it goes down more - PYPL is one of my core long term holdings, I would add to it.

Exactly, I’ve been screwed over too many times at 3:00 am when premarket opens
🥭 going to open above $80 tomorrow, small profit taking dip and then it's going to absolutely smash through $100 with no resistance. 

Just wait till boomers figure out they can buy stocks that make libs mad and/or Elon tweets something

Yea, it could be a girl dick or a boy dick you are sucking, it's the mystery of it all.
With shares you just need to look at market cap. Anything less than $3b is too low.

Fun fact: the original Dracula movie had an opening scene where Dracula goes in to suck the blood of a man on his neck…. That scene nearly got cut from the movie because the company thought it was too homosexual…. After that the studio got a stern letter stating “Dracula is only allowed to drink the blood of women!!!!”

Everyone's vote should be equal and the majority's ruling should be all that matters, end of discussion. Anything else is a desperate attempt to push the odds in your favor.

Boom up or boom down ?
Fair enough. Just know what you’re going through is a type of cognitive bias called confirmation bias.

I’m competent enough to argue and critique the other side and destroy their arguments. Give it to me.

But if you don’t even want to look at real evidence that disagrees with your beliefs, which are wrong, then I’m done here.

The information is there when you change your mind,

The ban was for 5 days for political BS.

That's nice of the mods to allow me back 

I usually support gamestop than I buy mango at 6am PST this morning and got all excited 

Then get banned...I was like WTF :/
Always good to see someone else who knows the statistics and data. Let’s go Brandon!!!
Last week I said if Tesla finishes above 812-815 it would shoot all the way up to 900 

Well, it was the first time I was ever right about a stock and I’m glad to say I’ve made $3000 off some calls, sold some, and bought more. 

If Tesla breaks 930 tomorrow I’m buying a one way ticket to peace and serenity
Put in an order for one 🥭tonight . Will see what the purchase price ends up being when the market opens
Fucken tards about to get burnt on 🥭s lmao
But being banned from going to a restaurant because you’re not vaxxed isn’t a dictatorship? Or atleast closer to one than anything Trump did?

made  money with MAGA stonk today and a symphathy play that rhymes with fun.. getting in again for round 2 after the usual friday profit taking
Alright got my ideas for tomorrow, won't be sure until Pre-Market though:

INTC 10/22 55c

SNAP 10/22 60c

FB 10/22 330c

TWTR 10/22 65c
Shop around, but I wouldn't invest money into that transmission if the car itself costs 2k
!banbet SQ 267.23 1D
Tf are you talking about they manufacture everything they own almost every supply line they have a population of almost 2 BILLION people and most of the debt America owes is to China. Also they're now winning the arms race, but yeah EcOnOmIc MeLtDoWn
I mean, yeah, there are still some MAGA cringelords on there, sure.
Almost every trade this week, I've managed to sell the very top. I'm so fucked next week...
Eh, Star Wars is a fun space fantasy. Dune is a commentary on the relationship between oil, politics, religion, and neo-colonialism dressed up in sci-fi clothes. Star Wars was influenced by Dune, but it’s not really fair to compare the two considering that the latter is a much more serious work.

Pretty easy actually - market cap is now 1.6 billion.  SNAP is $120 billion.  Even though TRUTH is a complete scam it is probably half as valuable as SNAP
Mango stock is how we stick it to the libs!
Trump saved the stock market!! 🇺🇸
Where’s the guy that bought snap at 53 and was cashing out at 60? That seemed like a legit play as long as it doesn’t pull a pypl

Well it isn’t just a problem if you’re poor. 

Sometimes you get triaged to their side in the ED. Sometimes you’re admitted to a department where the NP tries to admit you. People have the option to request for a doctor in those instances. 

They also cost to the patient the same, NPs will just order more unnessary tests and offload many off the costs to the patient vs the hospital.
It's going to drop like a rock.

All of the above ✊
Such a simp for saying that. Fact is, there’s too many dumb people…. And the actual smart people are few and far. Electoral college is never ever anywhere and will continue to put presidents in place who lose the “popular” vote
Lol that's a little bit *too* low. Like evergrande low
Lol
If you think today was ATH for mango, wait until Elon tweets MAGA. Today was a preview
They really did. I don’t know which I’m more pissed about… Star Wars or Jurassic Park. Both have been equally shit on
Trump won and the market is telling you that.
You’re thinking of twitter lol
Incoming depression over at the Gabby Petito sub now that 35 year old single women can’t jerk each other off over their true crime theories anymore
Better chance of that than AMC going to $1000 lol
Who needs spy when you have 🍅
the key is to set the bar unfathomably low so that no one has any expectations
It's doable on the street, but I'm guessing you don't have the right equipment. You need to drop the transmission to get to the assembly. How much is the shop trying to charge you?
I think everyone was. We’ve seen this shit come crashing down before lol
Usually me 🤷‍♀️🥵
Mango's are gay
I need a green dick tomorrow

Mango stock going to $1000 tomorrow guaranteed! All in!
350% on shares is fucking amazing tho. Even GME and AMC didnt have a 1 day run like that
That’s a Numberwang
its literally knocking  on the door
Everybody is going to buy the furthest OTM mango calls when options start, and they will absolutely print.
Yeah, it's pretty non-sensical. A 5% drop? Sure, understandable. 20%+? You'd think they killed somebody.

Fuck Gyna
Majority should be the only thing that matters. The electoral college is absolutely pointless.
Funny you think he loses money. Maybe he uses huge losses to offset other huge gains for tax incentives? The dude is a billionaire and always will be.
The issue is that Pelosi trades before the information is public. But I guess some people don't know the difference
Sucks not being able to trade in after hours/pre market…. Sold at $47 for a 350% profit because I was to scared to hold until tomorrow

 Is it safe to come out now?
Some people buy PLTR and wait 10 years for 600% gains , some people buy mangos for it to go up 600% in a day , and some people somehow finds a way to buy the absolute top on memestocks. Which one are you?
Lmao i can't wait until China absolutely obliterates this economy at will. You all deserve it tbh

Going to go watch it, but knowing it’s basically stopping mid-book is annoying.
Everyone buying 🥭 gonna have their bootyholes looking like Emily Willis in a couple days. Which is still pretty nice but damn

Completely unrelated haha. I think he's funny as fuck (but don't agree with most of his presidency/character. Some stuff he did during his presidency was good though)
Electoral college is in place for a reason. Majority doesn’t mean shit.
Sorry couldn't resist.
I’m wondering if my downvotes are bc I made deep five figure returns that seemed like a super obvious play or because I think trump is a cancer… I mean if you don’t think he controls the terrifyingly large dumb racist fuck social media market then I can’t help you.. low float spac with huge obvious retail momentum… and less than 500m market cap when I bought… that’s an obvious all in for at least a day or a gtc trailing stop order.

I think I have like a 13/15 record so far - almost every single time I hold something overnight, SPY opens the other direction. It’s crazy honestly. I have calls right now obviously. I think I’ll try a straddle Monday afternoon and see if we open flat on Tuesday
25 point lead too
Fuck, it might hit 500 tomorrow

In no way is saying any DNP is extensively trained in medicine appropriate, full stop.

Hoping FB makes some recovery tomorrow after following that SNAP drop. Holding a bunch of 10/29 $330c that were doing okay. If gets back up into the $330s I’ll hold into next week. Ugh.
I'm conflicted. I held $AMD and since last year the pattern is moon after $INTC ER, dip after own ER (even if it moons before next open) then back to mooning after 2~3 days. I'm tempted to just wait until ER and see what happens. If there's a pullback I'm going all in.
Get a signing bonus. Lots of places are offering them
Why not buy 100 shares (or several hundred, you do you) and sell covered calls when options are available?

Nope not at all. People should know their rights and advocate for healthcare they deserve.

Nope, many function independently and unsupervised. Their corrupt organization is advocating for increased independence in many restricted states.

&gt;Most diagnosis are made with lab draws and imaging so the doc is kinda overrated tbh.

Wrong again. But if you want to be put through the ringer and waste thousands of dollars of your own money because someone doesn’t know medicine c then be my guess.

The only thing you’ll be laughing at is how stupid you were not to see this gravy train from a mile away. Nothing to do with politics just look at it from a business perspective. This is gonna crush GameStop if an options chain comes out.

I'm guessing because of the potential BOFA buyout, it's near a 52 week low, and it had a nice dip today after finally showing signs of life for the first time since May. (disclaimer I know nothing about this company, I looked at the chart and top headlines for 2 min)

I spent so much time staring at 5 bagger profits from today that I missed the easiest mango smoothie ever
I mean I won't complain...my 10/29 910c might actually print tomorrow 🤑
To my great enjoyment
Day trade?  Who tf does that?  Gross.

My toddler kept handing me rocks that he found in the backyard and I wasn't really paying attention. One of them was a fresh dog turd. Have kids. It's great.
the stock doesn't even have options
My sister literally just graduated DNP last year. She is extensively trained in medicine and has the same authority as physicians. Stop spreading fud you dumb dumb
Fuk no. I enjoy this shit too much
So my essay DD is correct?
Just don’t show up. That’s what I always do. How can they prove I actually received that shitty letter
I’m going to laugh so hard when this crashes. Like 🥭

Cause you're a robot how many times
I'm always early like Michael Burry but on the long side. I bought mango premarket at 7am and sold at pretty much the bottom at 10.65. I'm way too early on my plays , happened with LAZR , GME , CLOV , many others that I couldn't think off the top of my head.
Been holding these DIDI bags since the IPO. 

Today felt pretty good. 

Will probably buy the dip tomorrow.

You didn't have a mango boba tea. Hence missing the third piece of the Shakespearean premonition trident.

Be glad you ain't Macbeth.
All I do is buy AAPL, SPY, and ARKK and then try to catch the early stages of pump and dump schemes now

I know my research and know medicine. I don’t think you do. Don’t spread misinformation and put people’s lives at risk.

Midlevels do not increase access, improve outcomes, or make healthcare cheaper for patients. It’s absolutely ridiculous the insane costs they’re putting on patients with unnecessary imaging, labs, and consults.
It's not too late to short TLT
Only one FAANG, we should call it snaggle tooth, 😆😂
DWAC

Lot of anecdotal hype from friends and family
That’s a hard one. AAPL is the market in alot of ways. Whats the guidance to justify the valuation? New phone colors ? 

Products are widely popular tho…

2% would be a safe bet
74.40...which retard did it
Sometimes you just gotta YOLO
Fitting really. If you think about it, snapchat?-snap?-thanos snap??
Call them and tell them that - if it's already booked they'll probably cancel or let you reschedule your summons for another date.
Let's not forget about Russia!
Here’s what’s gonna happen tomorrow. Mango will run up to 100, a lot of hype! Then, we will see it tank. Set those limit orders
Yeah guh rings a bell but a 2% drop then recover by lunch time isn’t an insane though. Sell outs at open, flip to calls.
snap crashes and orange mans stonk saves it

Bro who cares, yolo 10k into something and shut up
Well yeah, this is what happens when all of the biggest social apps for “fun” ostracize a giant majority of humans who just want to meme for their “side”, just like everyone else.
It's going to stabilize and probably start dropping by then
Got TTWO 185c’sand closed out 20 minutes later for a fiver
Get what? The fact that you think you understand anything is hilarious
Wouldn't it be funny if it was actually Snapchat that caused the great crash of late 2021?

You might want to do a little research there buddy. They are extensively trained in medicine.
Thank you spy for giving me hope for tomorrow
Two years ago here you’d already have 50 downvotes and be told options only pussy… I miss those times

I like being choked at the same time as my 🐓
I just got hit with a jury summons and I have my plane ticket for vacation in hand for next week. Is the universe fucking mocking me?
Crazy right??
Pretty much. Domino effect dips get bought up pretty instantly. And this dip happened in AH anyway.
Exactly, I’m looking at this completely apolitically  by the way. Way too many people would take a bullet for this man, of course they’ll dump their savings on the dude. Honestly I won’t be surprised if this shit gets to like a $30 billion market cap before ever even signing a deal.
thats the thing, we all know trump is a con artist lol

it might do ok for a bit as trump pumps into the hype, but he wont deliver in the long run, i expect the company to eventually go bust but the stock can easily run for a bit because this market is completely busted
It’s cause Biden is talking
What is this mango nonsense
I will be banned tomorrow since sofi didn't tank to 17 just know that the last back to the future is trash and number 1 is goated

I’m a simple man. I’m going on a ✈️ tomorrow so I bought ✈️ calls. Let’s fly BA. 11/5 217.5c
When I was young, we travelled to the motherland.  I met my dad's mother for the first time.  We had Tom Kha soup, and she topped it from fresh saffron.  It was delicious, and it felt like home.  $COIN feels like that moment, but better.

Been having AMD fomo all week. Do I buy 2022 calls? 
 
Edit: Forgot that it's 2021 already. How'd that happen.
Every position you attribute to the right is just made up fantasy and is a strawman

The fact that you utter it with complete conviction shows there is no competition of narrative in the media space, you literally dont know what anyone on the right thinks because no one on the right exists in media you watch

Also everyone knows right vs left is alternate realities. The question was is it viable to have a media that caters to right bias? I think so
Let me see what these Intel puts looks like already!
And I care even less that you don't care?
Since Thursdays are for FDs. What did guys pick up. I got f 16.50c for .11
Not in medicine. They’re trained in nursing. 

Don’t be mislead to believe the hours are equivalent. It’s similar to counting flight attendant hours as pilot training. Patients deserve better
Fuck mid levels. Also fuck hospital admin and health insurance companies. That’s why you’re healthcare is so expensive not because of the doc’s
Bullshit meter going off the charts
It’s like one of those white and orange swirled popsicles

oh look, no one cares...
I hope they fucking charge $15/month. Just don’t go fuck up and say it’s a political donation in any way shape or form…

As a regular Blaze listener / watcher, they are always behind on things like this.

They will wait until tomorrow to report what definitely happened, instead of taking a chance in live time on what could happen.

It’s the only way they can reduce getting destroyed by the machine if they’re wrong.
Dip is too tasty. Won't be none left by open
Ah you are correct! I withdraw my nerd call, good sir.
Its trump behind the name lmao, we all knew where it was going.
I never intended to imply that, just pointing out that levels of mandate were being implemented.  Again, companies are choosing to CYA. Your needs are secondary, welcome to capitalism.
Sux right, I said the same at 35$….
I hope they go green. Last night they were blood red
Buying INO. Still heavily shorted and tons of good news on the DNA COVID vaccine and partnership with Columbia, and deep talks with other countries.
Does the CME website or some other website post charts showing the Contango/Backwardization of Futures? I'm specifically interested in the Bitcoin Futures so that I can make a long/short decision on ticker BITO.
Basically why I bought in near open. Gamestop only has a following because of the stock. There are millions who would die for the guy, why wouldn't they invest in him?
Options too as soon as they open
You think Mango Mussolini has orange nut? Or white with a little bit of blood like the rest of us?
Damn, the market bankrupted cashflow so badly it mechanized him into a bot
Do it, put it all on the mango. You know you want too. How are you gonna live with yourself if mango goes to something absurd like $500 or a $1000 a share. You’re gonna be thinking you should have put your faith in the mango so you could retire early.
It’s like snap unleashed the gates of hell 🤤
🤣
I wonder if he is aware of this place. It's possibly the only place where he was actually judged fairly. Crazy how people that aren't offended by literally anything can be so fair in their judgments.

Hey that’s still a really nice profit though. :)

It's like they realized there's no S in FAANG
Just make up for missing out by doing something twice as risky, half as rewarding next time.
u got 300k thats a lot of money. plus theres always another one
Sorry bro.
He leaves no American behind.
You've made far more than most of the morons here. Stick to it.
Who’s buying 0DTE calls on SNAP tomorrow ? I for sure am
Anyone with no brains at all could have put money into TQQQ last year and made a profit. It's not hard, FAANG/FAGMAN stocks are growing at like 100 percent per year.
Holy shit futs going green maybe my 456C 0 dte aren’t fucked
Calls ORCL
At least the other days you do believe how stupid you are.
Keep doing what your doing when shit hits the fan u will be better off while most are losing all of their gains
It says that the person made the bet when SNAP was $58.52 which is today AH. It hadn't hit that price for months before this.
couldve easily went the other way and blew your portfolio up

weve seen tickers run up 1000% in a month but at least there were companies behind the names, this particular one doesn't even have a released product yet so its a total gamble

you might win a few gambles here and there but theres no way to consistently win doing that, you'll eventually get screwed and lose it all
Y’all bulls are salty
You are doing a very good job to have 300 percent profit. I mean if you want to gamble then go ahead. But keep it up 👍🏼
No sh&amp;t, the same happened to me.  Completely missed it until end of the day.  Had to do real work and didn't see any discussion on it plus distracted from TSLA
How did you come to know about it.
80 or so million people are about to start pumping their entire pay checks into Truth to show up the libs. Not even counting the independents and liberals who will invest because they like money
So sad. His time was just arrive.
I'm hoping 🥭 calls in to cnbc or fox news to talk about it. You know he's gonna brag
SPY volume was anemic today, eod dump was sure win
It does. One number is higher than the other. I just thought it was interesting that trumps stock which was $9 ended up going higher than Twitter on its first day of the announcement. You’re reading into this too much.
Pepsi 🥭 doesn’t taste very good
That’s what happens when a company sits on their laurels for about 20 years without ever innovating. They got too comfy and now it’s too late to play catch-up. Even if they make big changes I think they’ll struggle this decade.

I really like you all and everything but I really want this tesla 885P to print hard.
I had a mango smoothie for lunch yesterday, and a salad with mango bites for dinner. 

There were signs and I didn't pay attention. 🤡
I can’t believe how stupid I am some days
Show me literally any evidence to support this claim.
It’s actually herpes
You're right.
This is a reminder that if you’re a medical student or physician to join the PPP
Turned 100k into 300k this year by playing it safe. no options, no chasing of stocks that have ran more than 10% in past week, always set stop loss. 

Then i look at stocks like orange that runs 700% in a day and I wanna kill myself. I was literally looking it and so close to hitting that buy button while it was $19 and told myself I should stick to what works, fuck.

pretty justified. They have been barely staying afloat by lowering their margins and subsidizing their CPU's

Now with having to spend large amounts of capex to build new foundries, which will almost 100% have yield issues when they first start producing they are going to have to either keep subsidizing and keep their margins low, or increase margins by reducing the subsidy. Not to mention how they literally are NEVER on time with a project and always over budget...

Either way AMD benefits because their EPYC is already better performance-to-cost and they apparently don't have the same issues with margins that Intel has.  And AMD has been executing absolutely perfectly for 14+ quarters in a row with datacenter growth.

Fuck Intel.

Why the fuck didn't I see anything about Mango until now? I mean Jesus. Yall really think it'll go double digits?
Thanks for reminding me, I might watch it tonight.
I still can't believe you took my Apple calls seriously. It was clearly a joke and you probably will spin it that I'm only calling it a joke because it didn't work out.
Nice I am going to see it tomorrow!
Long live the 🥭
Love you too bbg 😘
Nothing else in the market makes sense why shoukd this be any different.
Users doesn’t mean active, engaged posters though. People downloaded as a curiosity and deleted it.

In December 2020, Parler had around 2.3 million daily active users.
Actually really impressed with AAL’s earnings all things considered.
Only one person can pump more the the Muskateer.  🥭

It went to $75.11 today, nerd.

I prefer MANGAPE
Missed a 0
We just need an options chain on Mango and it’s GG. Shit might rocket to a $1000 a share I wouldn’t be surprised. More people have a love and undying faith in the mango than they do in GameSlop. That’s isn’t even an opinion it’s just a fact
If you’re right I’ll let you suck my toes boss

Yes but you never know.
I picked up some 452's for tomorrow.  Just to teach myself again why I shouldn't be messing with puts
I wonder if they have some rules about it

Does LCID or HOOD have more lock up dates coming. I don’t know and I’m retardant and rely on WSB for DD
Want me to show you my gains in TSLA 880 c ?

And my INTC Put tomorrow?
The “vaccines” don’t prevent anything tho
For federal contractors, testing is not an option. Even so, companies are not going to allow a testing option as that will eat into margins. 3 companies out of the s&amp;p 500 doesn’t show that the majority of the companies thought it was a good idea.
Somehow I get the feeling that index futures are going to go from a mix of red and green to solidly green by the morning…
Babe, you look like a million ducks 🦆

Can't wait for talk radio to start pumping Mango tomorrow, LOL.  Looked at The Blaze and was surprised to see no mention of it.
You know the FOMO was real when mf's were buying it at 70 bucks at almost the end of AH
Imo I think Oil calls (XOM,USO,XOP, etc.) maybe expiring end of year. Inflation is running rampant and there was a good pullback today. Should give your the return you’re looking for. Energy crunch should come into picture as the winter comes around.

Pretty much, for a few more days at least

Weren't you bullish yesterday?

Calls on $METH
It's at 75.50 ah
I think itll be mostly flat overall maybe red to green…if its lookin green for next weekend then big money will be loadin up already too by end of day. I wasnt in snap before anyways but bought some after hours a couple times just trading it then loaded up at end too
You would have turned 300k to 2.1M today if you bought mango stock premarket. Shorters or whoever was selling was selling 40M+ worth of shares in 40 mins. They were selling at bid constantly which pushed the price down from 12.40 to 10.40 for 40mins straight.
AAPL puts for earnings? 🤔 awfully tempting, maybe 2% OTM

There’s no way mango is gonna keep running 😭
I've been roasted by members of the sub before but no one roasts like /u/VisualMod
Oh man ppl really going to get cucked on a certain ex prez linked spac… trying to figure out when to buy those puts

Thanks snap for the dip buying opportunity on google
Tax season will be fun this year
What’s good with MAGA stock?
i said safest
Better question, why do you hate money?
you double posted this u dumb fuk bot

I mean short term cap tax at the lowest is 10%. Dumb idea to get a LOC against stock holdings tho
Dropped a few thousand in $ROOT!!! Carvana making plays to buy them out!

Will the first mango up the ass bet be placed this week?
Anyone have faith in MJUS? Still waiting on that federal backing lol.
Biden’s mandate is vaccine or get testing.  I know of at least 3 publicly traded companies that have had varying levels of mandates since well before the Biden plan was announced.

Again, the vaccine is such a low risk item that carries so many other benefits.  Refusing to take it because someone else told you to is such toddler-brained bullshit.
I bet it does. Will I be buying any personally, no

Just like old times

Parler had 15 million users and was the most downloaded app earlier this year. Not trying to hear that people weren't using it.
I do hear you about FB though. Most people won't delete that because they have over a decade of pics, posts, etc that they want to keep for whatever reason.
My wife just called me retarded for telling her that
Yeah I don’t give a fuck who made the stock blow up, I just want tendies
I said bass.
Nah… we just wanna make money
I have 300k, whats the safest way to turn that into 500k in 2 months?
Easiest fucking money anyone will make is buying the stocks that snap hurt. Whether they'll recover tomorrow or in a week or two. They will. I'm an idiot and even I can see it.
Don’t disparage teddy three legs
Even better.
Things were just so sad and bland and boring until mango came and spiced up the market.

Investing is even more fun, now. I want to see the memes. I want to see antimangoes and promangoes making money. Together. Because WSB is about money. Not your gd political circlejerks.
Sniffing your moms ass

Just went to the store and not a single person was bagging groceries except the customers and the checkout workers. At least back in the day places had the common decency to give you a discount if you bagged your own shit.
turn back the clock 24 hours and buy dw4c at open

I paper handed at 350% near end of day 
Assumed it would stall 

Instead big tech fell and bought mangos 🥭

Stocks are literally never worth the effort. Wait for the derivatives.
Man, that's the sixth Margin Call this month.
So I got my Halloween costume today and it’s a medieval monk/priest robe with a hood and it’s white….yyyeeeaaaa….should of thought that through before hand. Had to return it and order black.
Now I found that it was for the employee of the month award ceremony
not sure why anyone would buy puts on SPY ever, jpows 401k is all in SPY and its his largest holding in his non-reg account

its literally the worst ETF to buy puts on, jpow will fuk u in the ass

SPY opens above 453 trust me
SNAP is transitionary.
the mango is back to rescue us from bankruptcy

If it somehow managed to repeat today’s %gain it would be around 350
There are so many community colleges, that would end up costing quite a large sum. It would be cheaper and appeal your voter base the same if you just made every state school free in the country for In-State students. It’s already subsided partially by the state just cover the remainder.
That’s some wild logic
Based on my recollection of 🥭's past, non-real estate ventures, I think I know exactly what to do with MangoSocial after it goes more parabolic and the options chain opens up
Could’ve fucked your bitch, but she made my dick soft

Why pay tax on selling assets when you can take loans against it for 2-3%?

Should've brought the fart machine. "Wow (insert bitches name from work)! Have some respect! "
Monday/Tuesday is gonna be parabolic
Naw, i jumped in but now im a hypocrite in my roommates eyes
Inverse logic on SPY is how you make money after trading for years. Been fucked too many times buying puts near ATH
Ban
Yeah this is why japs have sex dolls.... To tell them sweet things devoid of reality 😂😂.

Red Friday bud. Next week will be green tho.
I hope the after hours trading isn’t predictive of what will happen tomorrow.
i like the new rules the fed put in place to prevent corruption, its very honest and cool

as long as you buy SPY and don't sell, you are all good as a fed member

Gonna but more MAGA tomorrow. Hopefully we have a few days before MAGUH
I feel ya. Made $120 then lost $300. I think I’m on the right track.
&gt; You're a fucking idiot.
Sometimes you can start as a low level dealer and you start meeting people up the supply chain. Once you build up some trust the people further up will start offering up other opportunities including transport. You set up some guarantees and fly out to California, Colorado, etc. Sometimes you will have to drive but trains are usually a safer bet. You complete a few solid runs and you can sometimes move up to become more of a decision maker. At the end of the day, you just have to play the drug game for a bit and it’s usually one of the steps on the the way up if you don’t end up locked up.
How can I turn $50k to $300k to pay of student loans?
Yes, but they're sold out. They're selling for marked up prices on ebay
will DWAyne the roCk johnson get options any time soon?
That is true but these wide sweeping mandates were not issued until the Biden eo which makes me think that the companies thought it was bad policy to institute these mandates
Snaps definitely going to recover some tomorrow as long as market is green or flat eh?
Hmm decisions decisions. Should I go for mango shares or warrants ?
Mango goes to $500 tomorrow and $5000 next week.
There is no product.  Very bullish
Hold the 🥭 nurture the 🥭 then bang the 🥭
Yields flat but stonks down AH.  It is rare but never good when both bonds and stonks go down.  We need to break ATH in stonks or market going to start pricing in inflation.
Ahhh!  It maybe a dictionary.
im sorry fam, but we disagree on GME.

but we agree on 🥭 so thats good.
My gut tells me MAGA retard stock gonna be mega retarded tomorrow and over the weekend... my predictions are triple digits by Monday
What’s up your ass? Relax.
Mango is the new SPAC Jesus!

Welcome to the Party, pizza is over there
No it doesn’t. Stop with this TA astrology
All the amc apes talking about 10,000 a share were right.  They just had the wrong stock.
yeah there are plenty of TV shows that teach you

Breaking Bad, Narcos, etc.
I mean the mango stock will likely keep mooning for a while. There’s no way the product is anything less than a complete shit show though.
We buying more MAGA tomorrow or what? I was out of BP today
I wish you luck, but that’s a really lousy idea.
Knowing my luck, most likely a clown but we’ll see 🥲
🥭 up all the way, it’s the only way. GME is long down, sorry to say
Good luck sir 

I’m holding only stock and selling calls on them.
The years start coming and they don’t stop coming
I mean how much can you buy with $3k?
Is that whales I see outside of the Mango Grove?
You gotta start with something like a cucumber 

Now, this is very important: *warm up* the KY before you spread it on the cucumber, *then* put the cucumber in your butt. You’re trying to get the muscles used to being in that position so leave it for a few minutes at a time then let them relax

From there, graduate to slightly larger fruits and veggies each time you feel ready and pretty soon you have a good pocket going in your butt 👍

I am as well.  I just closed my short leg on my spread on Tuesday.  Should be able to ride my calls through earnings and drug approval.

If it gets a pop above $90, I’ll trim heavily, but I imagine that won’t happen that quickly.
I still prefer the 84 version more
So edgy
Thinking man right here. FB beats earnings and you'll see a spike.... Now it's the buy the rumor ( puts), sell the news (calls).
DWACW is the play tomorrow, with close end of day.

Watching ad business &gt;&gt; SNAP, FB, TTD and ROKU
There is no nice and not nice, no good and evil.  There's only strong and weak...I learned that from Sensei Kreese in Kobra Kai.

Go for the money!
WSB can be a  caricature of itself from time to time.
🥭 back in season
Going to return this thesaurus I bought today. Not only is it terrible, but it's terrible.
Kinda amazing.  Mango is going nuts tomorrow
Dropping last 3k on the retarded MAGA stock tmrw cause fuck it retards gonna be retarded
It looks like tomorrow’s going to determine if we lose momentum and risk a double top. If so, smoothest bag transfer ever.  From correction to near ATH in 7 sessions…🐻 gaped for sure!
It will probably go up or down and to the right. For a more serious answer, the dip was a ripple effect by Snapchat's earnings where they blamed Apple for hindering their ad business but since Amazon and many other tech companies who dont rely on ads will probably bounce back tomorrow.
Damn you Jimmys Johns
🍊🥭🚀
Started watching Squid Games yesterday. Good as fuck.
Wow! Tendy town awaits you
Goog won't see any gains from smashing earnings. Lol
Happened last quarter.

Alsways go with Class A.
I made 20$ on 🥭 flipping 1000 shares back and forth.  I am so fucking bad at this
dear jack ma,

please raise baba from the ground and let it fly like an eagle tomorrow

amen
Wtf he has a spac but no app yet? You can't make this up
I leave for 2 hours, was at the gym now you guys talking about 🥭? Please explain.
I have Browns debit spread to win but only by a field goal.

I'm offsetting my risk by selling Baker Mayfield calls to retards who thinks hes playing
Earnings got de-risked thanks to SNAP… at least I think they did
DIS 175c for 12/17, 1/21/22, 2/18/22


Just looking to swing trade once it bounces back to 176-178. Might hold depending on price action and market conditions
We will see lol, could be a great bet. Or you could be a clown.
I’m surprised Merck doesn’t get more attention on here
Is there actually going to be options?
If TSLA gives free FSD to employees, it's probably not that good
You can always just quit.  They’re not making a decision for you, they’re just covering their asses.  Much easier to make a blanket policy.

Plus, why not get it?  I can see people on here being such shut ins they legit don’t see anyone, but the back isn’t for you, it’s for everyone else you interact with.
Step 1. Practice shoving flour filled condoms up your ass.  Step 2.  ???  Step 3. Profit.

My ford puts did me so dirty idk how I’ll do it
In my high school stocks class we r playing the stock market game, bought $14,000 worth at 12.73ea
After hours has low volume so moves are exaggerated. Time overnight to digest the numbers and see analyst’s takes are. It’s a meme stock so has sheer numbers behind it in terms of investors propping it up. Look at how low volatility and volume was today. I think it’s just retail buying and big boys lightening their bags.
Bout to find out as soon as these kids go to sleep

Is this a ploy
yes. anyone selling AH based on an earnings report is likely to be an algo or a smart money institutional investor who actually listened to the call or read the report. Anyone buying at open is likely to be a retard TSLA ape gambling on 0 DTE calls and MMs forced to hedge
Margin call on the horizon. Tits up buddy
Yah
At some point the financial press will freak out about the Turkish lira. I'm guessing once the exchange rate passes 10. The world is ripe for a contagion scare.
Oh
Pretty much just a con man
It's not supposed too?
The average age of death from covid is higher than the average age of death. The death rate is roughly equal to a bad flu(it's hard to know fully because the way they counted deaths was whack). Also the average comorbidity for people who died of covid was roughly 3(that means you are at very high risk and not healthy)  

Natural immunity has been shown to be 27 times more effective than the vaccine. 

They are firing people with natural immunity that also work from home. 

The mandates are fully regarded and nonsensical politically theatre

People like you who know nothing and spout off are hilarious but scary, because you are convinced you're right. Youre like the C student who thinks he got an A on the final.
Is Dune any good?
How much money are we gonna lose at open boys?
I don’t see it happening. Will see
Hey, I got in with 50 shares at $18. I'm having a blast.

True, definitely not political even though i camel cased it to be snarky.  Social media has a monopoly but they pissing off groups of customers.  Once those customers get another choice they will move fast.
Parler and Gab don’t give me much confidence in that.
Are you Jesus ? Congrats
Betting big on MRK after seeing all the morons in here saying “w-w-why should I get vaxxed when I can just treat it with ivermectin/MCA/Molnupiravir ???”  

Never bet against American pill culture.  Why prevent disease when you can just treat it after the fact?
as cash ganger, same
Probably next week
Oof. I was beating myself for leaving about 600 in gains on the table when I closed my 342.5 calls today. Not feeling so bad now.
When I move you move
Normally tastes funny unless you’re fucked up
Only 11k in options
We may get fucked by 🥭 or get rich, who knows
20% out of the money put credit spread on SNAP was free money they said. Now I’m in shambles, unless by some miracle I am able to roll these spreads out further before they get exercised.
I honestly do think we will be green by open this time.
So?🍊🥭 all in on 🥭 make some 🍌🍌🍌 for us apes? Or is this gonna tank? I’m hearing this is possibly the next GME? Or will it drop like my dick
Yes that’s how stock reporting works.  For all stocks

But keep acting like a victim.

Are you ready for the red rip tomorrow?
Dude shut up no one cares u baby
I can only speak for the largest entertainment companies. Not sure about other sectors of the economy.
Most of Tesla trading is short term call option buying, it’s MMs positioning the ridiculous call buying.
Yep. I went to a QAnon site, a LOT of them are trying to figure out what "settled" means and want to know why they're being censored from buying it. 

Next week will be wild, but a LOT of bag holders are being born right in front of our eyes.
Red Pills vs Blue Pills. Think of it as you would The Matrix.
If they're far out, you're fine.
It wasn't a bad play tbh...fb is the only big tech stock that had massive upside.

Also, it will rebound.
as a permabull I really hope we get another juicy crash
No. Must be a poor state thing.
You’re not wrong, but seriously, if roles were reversed and 44 had been banned, and announced his own media company today… I would expect the exact same thing to happen on the other “side”.

Can someone explain how TSLA can be down 2% AH then shoot up 3% right at open. Are the groups selling AH different from the groups buying at open?

Okay
Literally every media article about this has a pic of Donnie's face this is going to break $500
Meaning you think it will go down because of Snap causing ppl to think FB down ?
&gt;nooooo don't get the vaccine there's nanochips in there!

They might get a notification of a companies stance but no company I know of is forcing workers to prove their vaccination status. As long as you’re WFH no one gives a fuck what you’re doing.
Losing a job over the vaccine mandate is such a limp-wristed move. Imagine being that much of a baby.
All bullshit and meme aside.  If the 🥭 app isn't a complete shit show it is bearish for twitter and facebook.  There a shit ton of people that might jump ship on the old social media apps because of mAh bEiNg cEnSoREd
“TMTG makes 400% in 2 days, here’s how that actually makes your groceries and gasoline go up”
For the moment, maybe some. 

But wait till it drops. Wait till the hype has passed and those smart enough to look find out there is no god damn business plan. That the ceo has a gmail address for his contact info and a physical address in Wuhan China. 

The cheerers will hold the line as best as possible and try to convince themselves it’s a win, like they have for the last 5 years of idiocy. But the money will talk. 

And then they’ll be bag holders. Lost not only the “new investment” but all the god damn money they donated to a bottomless pit leading up to it for nothing.
the rednecks in alabama are still waiting for their life savings to be deposited into RH. Next week will be fucking fun.

Currently at 65.55.
CLF rips on earnings in the morning, yes or no?
Imagine being afraid of nano-chips. Like WTF. It was always my dream to become a cyborg.
I had this thought earlier today when trying to decide on whether or not to make a risky trade. I realized that the only things I remember regretting in my trading history is the big gains I missed out on, not the losses I’ve had. Now the caveat to that is I’ve never lost everything in a bad trade.
Seriously intc always falls on earnings and it always helps amd

I got in and out 18-38. Bought back in AH at 66 😂 fucking fomo man. I’m buying more when them funds hit tomorrow

What are we thinking pre-market for SNAP?
Snap gonna do another-10% tomorrow
It takes one to know one!
Gonna be some mighty big Trump branded bags tommorow.
Because they are stupid fucks
Started premarket at 12.15, up bought to cost basis 15.85.   Such a great stonk
I don’t know. Look at market cap and shares outstanding. This can be the next GME for reaal. Probably scalp some tomorrow
The only reason retards think all media is biased towards the left is because they live in fairy tale world. You think every media company across the entire world is biased left? Lmao, that's only cause you believe in conspiracy theory bullshit. COVID is real vs COVID is a plandemic, global warming is real vs global warming is a globalist conspiracy, election was legit vs election was a fraud, ivermectin can cure COVID vs ivermectin doesn't do shit for COVID, Iraq has nukes vs Iraq doesn't have nukes, and the list goes on and on. These are verifiable facts vs dumbass conspiracy theories.
Amazing game. Yes.
Yes, my company is mandating even though we are remote
Oh snap!!!!
Gme is forever over
wsb is so much better when the chat is like this and not 100k deep

Mango now at 65.55 🙃 up 20 since close. I'm actually hard rite now. Since I bought a 1,000 at 22.34
If a trader references the motely fool in any positive light ,just assume they lost money on Tesla puts.
Wow, really?  I am vaccinated but that is not logical.

Same also I realized today my last rly big win was amd calls last earnings season. Considering only trading 4 times a year
Grown ass man still afraid of needles
ya i think i was just pissed cuz i made a dumb trade. now that i'm calmer i realize i was just being stupid. that said i'm still done with trading. the more trades I make the worse I do. the boomers were right, buy and hold is the way.
No balls, no glory.
It’s the president of fruit of the loom
Taking all my Mango gains to GME.

Don't be fooled, GME is the next GME
Dude I did the same thing with the trump stock today saw it at 35$ and as like nah and now look at the mofo
what's this about mangos today? I like mangos.
Mango's Stock TO THE MOON🚀🌕❤
See, told yall

Not a fan of his, but I wouldn’t take anything that’s before his 1 year mark. Even then it would have to be bigger odds than that.

How about the ability for old winners?
Trump finally realized it’s easier to make money on pump and dump than real estate
they are already talking about fundamentals and 17M net profit on billions in rev, no where to grow. dead company in my opinion.
Sdc wishes it were 🥭
the potential for abuse is very high

I like it, but let me think about it for a bit
Parse the most up voted one line zingers into a table and let a winner random flair from it.  I know more work but much better results.
Dip tomorrow morning or more 4x?

I’m at 12.82 after buying 10 additional shares at 20
How can I get a flair to begin with?  I was trying to think of something clever to say but I’m to drunk for that shit
Sitting with a thumb in my ass thinking at $14 nah it’s already up to much. Meanwhile playing CLF earnings. Should I liquidate some other positions and fomo into to 🥭 ? 

Are options open tomorrow?
Remote software devs are getting mandates too btw asshat

I don’t need your validation. Just letting you know you sound like you just started doing this and you think you know shit when you don’t. I’ve been trading for over 15 years
One Bear day, then moon again?
I think I fixed the bug, turns out you should put in code to clear the flair if you want it to clear the flair
Lol. Don’t do this to yourself comrade. Seriously, it’s ok to be happy for something. Enjoy a good time.

That’s news to me. Here in Tennessee people in their late 20’s and early 30’s are selling their starter homes for twice what they paid less than 5 years ago.

Dude … everyone knows what SPy is. Tech is QQQ. Don’t fucking embarrass yourself. Also there is no tech sector anymore. Tech is everything. Tech is in everything
Possibly bigger. The largest percentage move ever was Volkswagen during its squeeze.

I think this has a chance to beat that.... tomorrow.
Watch everything open down 3% tomorrow then the media could blame 🥭 ipo
Ok sure, profit is profit. But the opposers watching from the sidelines are about to rip all their hair out watching this.
Think about those Snap holders, I dont think they gonna have a good sleep tonight.  RIp
I bought FB calls. put close to 75% of my portfolio in the calls. I’m so fucking screwed
Might fuck around and buy some SNAP weeklies. Way, way, wayyyyyy oversold.
Tesla does not depend on Apple 🍎, it’ll be fine.
Getting rid of a body?
Lmao I still laugh about Microsofts AI getting really rude and racist forcing them to shut it down.
Possible 480 like next week. This shit is going to another galaxy. Memeable, half an angry country behind it, old money repubs behind it, apparently wsb behind it. This is gonna be bigger faster than anything we’ve ever seen
Imagine your company shitting the bed so bad that I sends many other stocks down 5%+

A color lottery isn't a bad idea I suppose. I think color rankings would be cool though. And maybe allow certain privileges after winning a number of bets? 


For example, allowing any color choice after a streak of wins, or a special color. Just throwing ideas out there
Half of this sub is about to get vaporized. Including me. Let’s fucking go
ya genius most of his hardcore supporters don't even know about it. It took like a week for the GME movement to actually happen
Honestly the smartest way around talking about what we're not suppose to talk about
Yeah that’s a Canada thing. Over the border every home has basically surpassed the 2008 peak

I won’t explain here but I have my reasons for saying that November and possibly December will be completely fucked. If you want, let’s do this remind me
Sooo …. What happens to GME now?  What’s the life cycle of a meme stock?
I’m in since I’m 1/0 and can finally get some hard earned flair
People who support him will just hold forever. Getting over GME's $480 is possible
I'll try it now, thank you. I still believe there's something off with the flair prompt itself, though. I'll remove now per your advice. 

P.s. can you flair me literally anything if it does work? 

!flairstats
What do you mean, I turned him off yesterday.
If he owes anything then his tax attorneys don’t know how to use the loopholes that our crooked politicians put in place.

Totally random. Even flair colors that usually are reserved for mods and other gay stuff random. You win a bet, you get a "can_set_flair = True" and you can send something to VM to play the color lottery.

That was the way I planned it. Thoughts?
Straddle that $JAINA
This has to be the biggest fxkin’ sale ever. $GOOGL, $SNAP, $FB, $TWTR, and even $PYPL are all taking a shit. I still won’t load up on calls just yet though.
Is it still just for nudes?  Call me a boomer i guess
[deleted]
? What are you referring to, when you say fundamentals... I believe the next 3/4 weeks will be fucked
Just a small city of 300k.
Nah, I hate the man, he’s a bumbling fucking boomer idiot, and you know it too. But I’ve been in since this morning. 

I’m glad to make money off of you all pumping what will inevitably a clusterfuck of a shitty social media forum just because his name is attached.
Ohhhhhh so when trump was talking about his net worth 5 years ago he was talking futes..now makes sense

Please tell me we get options tomorrow
That was my logic too but I’ve seen so many spacs dumped I cut my position by 80% at end of day. It went up to fucking 74 already after hours. This shit going to 1000. GMC AMC none of that has anything on this. This has the president behind. 80 million Americans behind it. Big dick red old money behind it. WSB meme heaven. So many reasons this is going to the moon
Don’t forget my comment got TTCF correct now tilray is next to get a nice boost up
What should I do about Coco Vita? Debuted today to a 7% loss. Do I wait out the stock a little and invest then or should invest now expecting a rebound soon?
What are the odds SPY will end tomorrow red? 0.1% or 0.01%? Trying to manage risk in my portfolio.
Anybody buying MAGA etf? No way the eventual mango stock isn't added

Post gain porn

Okay so you live in the middle of nowhere nevermind lmao. Are there any big cities there? I’m sure Toronto, Montreal or Quebec are all ridiculously priced. My friend sold his summer home in Quebec for like twice what his family bought it for a decade ago
Green flair color for winner and red for loser, stays for a month or quarter?  Flair stays the same but gets the color font or an addon icon?
Sorry next time I’ll add a 🥭 and it’ll all be OK…
Be on your toes all day tomorrow. If it’s anything like the game store ride it can go south in a hurry. Gonna be fun to watch!
Found Forte Capital Management and the YTer is so cute!!

Im sorry, if you got burned by INTC you CANNOT complain. You knew the risk you were taking... look at what happened last earnings, the earnings before that, and so on lmao
Yeah, this is gonna be entertaining sht
I hear this sometimes… but what brokerage doesn’t allow after hours?
Man I bought a few shares at like 13.16 and sold before it reached 15. Could have turned $75 into almost $400 at this point. Wonder if it’s worth it to buy back in?
Amd about to carry my portfolio like Brady and the bucs
This is obvious. It’s like saying the obvious thing really loud and thinking it’s funny.

Let’s do November,
Russian hookers pissing on Presidents, Steele Dossier is legit, etc. 

Bullshit is on both sides.

Get a grip.
Spy calls still being held
People still confused what mango is + Boomers always late + Insane ah fomo + Friday payday + Tomorrow morning news cycle + Circuit breaker hype + Cramer probably passes + Reverse psychology thinking tomorrow is red, since today is green, so tomorrow will obviously be green = $300 by close.
Going to stop over trading and trust my plays from now on… I’ll chalk it up to market tuition I guess
Yeah it’s an insane long term value tbh
You should be able to say !flairstats again and it'll wipe your flair. Does it? You can adjust your "first seen in WSB" date. lmk if you want to know how to do that.
Soon enough you won't even be able to deduct losses from gains!
On what app
#BB calls — what the hell else would my move be?

The other side yoloing into a ticker having no idea what it is to combat 🥭's spac would be 2021 politics at its finest... it'll probably work
Great idea. How about colors ranked by the stake of the bet?
I mean BB was always a long term move. Still holding my 3/2022 10c and stocks at avg of 10.07
I thought all retail is on Robinhood where you can trade AH?
Noticed that the McDonalds near my childhood apartment in Sunset Park has been dismantled. Bye-bye piece of my childhood

A buddy of mine who is legit wealthy (develops CRE in TX) but still likes playing around in the stock market texted me like “damn I was on calls all day missed it! Should I still buy some?” 

I was like dude…National evening news segments about a trump stock? Seems 2 EZ
Trump 'n Dump
I advertise in FB and we had entire campaigns get destroyed by that iOS change. Personally, I think remarketing is less creepy than some of the interest-based targeting they still offer
Longer bet time or a punishment. For instance I set a ban or drink gas if TSLA don’t hit $900.
&gt; I can't be mad about every single one, there are too many of them.
For what? Saying that people have 0 attention span and jump from one thing to the next at a moments notice?
Smart move.
My ban bet for tomorrow is JOE to 42. 

With 🥭 Pumping, I may have a chance
Can it be mango colored?
Come oooon $25 CLF, daddy needs another audi
I'll make out like a bandit if this happens
you can't get mad about every coulda woulda, too many of em
All you can do! I’d be very weary of holding it over the weekend unless it pumps throughout the day tomorrow. Idk what you’re in for but don’t be afraid to take some profits tomorrow. It can rocket either direction quickly!
Is mayonnaise an instrument?

Nothing comes up in Google when I search that.
/u/zjz the type of dude to hold the door for himself and say "why thank you"
IF U DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS, THEN U CAN'T AFFORD IT
if its a 🌈🐻 who lost their flair should be rainbowed so we all know the dummies
DFV holds mango his magic will work again
It’s a fruit. A fruit is a rainbow bear
Can you imagine doing a ban bet this morning for mango to go 300%? Woulda been cool
SNAP will be back at 70 next week
fd’s are more fun
It might be priced in ... its probably priced in . . Supposedly it was priced in to SNAP earnings too though.

It always has the potential to be much worse than the market was expecting

That’s the key ain’t it? The PAST 10 years have been great but what about the next 10 years? When tech got buttfucked in 2000 the Nasdaq was down almost 80% from its highs. TQQQ would have gotten annihilated. In fact if you run a backtest you’ll see that you would still be in the red (down close to 80%) 21 years later while regular QQQ would be up over 350%. Learn about volatility decay. These triple leveraged funds are great in bull markets and are terrifying in extended bear markets.

Totally with you bro.  I wish they’d split it 100-1.  The thing would really get the retail crowd stirring.
Mostly just curious, I'm pretty much guessing either way though!
I’m buying the dip for sure tomorrow oct 29 weeklie
Got some McDonald's in honor of the pumpmaster
You’re not even mad you missed out on an almost 350% gain?

Lol. Reddit in 2021.
There’s no dump
Regina
Alright im convinced, 200+ tmrw
FOR ME THIS SPAC IS A BLESSING; MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING THAN: BER R FUKT, BULL R FUKT SHIT; IT WAS GETTING STALE
IV #NaN
Going to look at when they can dilute… that date is what you look at to decide when to GTFO
Most brokers offer fractional shares already so not much need to split in order to reach the masses anymore
it took me a minute..still wondering why mango and not orange
Or ability to get a flair
Only options available are Corona or snorting Crayons
#funny how quickly people can go from 🅱️🅱️ 🚀 to souring on it and moving to the next. WSB cracks me the hell up. The real ones KNOW…….
Fuck it, we’ll sell it for a $1 and then otm xom calls
You're about to find out.
Honestly wat a crazy ass day it was.
*COUNT DWACULA*
What's the flair set command
there’s no dump
Is rainbow a color?

No I was thinking the same thing evaluate market close tomorrow

Dropped another 500 on mango. LFG!

Pump, yes.      dump, not even close
Same lmao
I support it but could we also have flairs for the sole purpose of publicly shaming people who lost their ban bets

You could grab warrants for now
I'm not the one who needs a safespace social media LMFAO
I just want flair,man
Is red redemption 2 a good buy at 40$?
In between 1-2 weeks I believe. It took at least a week to get to this price, so 🥭 is pumping way harder. I wouldn’t compare timelines and make guesses off of it.
Wouldn’t surprise me , that ticker is the only door DWCA has of putting politics into wsb
Too much pride
For Halloween I wanna dress up as DWACULA
I like it. Mine would hopefully be brown.
Buy some chipotle?
it's kinda creepy at this point
This is easy. Get two cheeseburgers. Take the tops off. Put a chicken ring on top of one of them. Apply honey mustard. Put other slider on top. For extra credit top with clam strips.
Yep, but YouTube being the elephant and gorilla in the room… Roku is hoping to get something on a monopoly lawsuit or some shit.

Amazon is going to have a TV, Comcast has a TV coming out, my last two Vizio TVs haven’t used Roku, my LG has its own interface, the Samsung TVs I bought my other family members… no Roku
Alexis Texas ❤️❤️
I guess, my FOMO is heavy but I'll skip this time. Watch it run to 200 tomorrow tho, you can thank me for that then
Always go Googl not goog, Googl is more liquid

What do you think of being able to set your flair once with a random color as a reward for having won a ban bet?

My roommate said i can't complain about trump anymore because i purchased agent orange
Puts for mango the second theyre out
I never hopped on the mango train and I’m not even mad. This stock is exactly what this sub needed. Will be pure chaos
Uhh where do u live?
*psst* feds and politicians have been insider trading for decades.
Bro a former president of the United States attached himself to a fucking SPAC. This goes so far beyond memes.... This shit is going to a $1000 it is a real life shitcoin, I just don't see how this is going to stop going up even if they have no product to show for

Which time?
Any , damn,  day...
A share and option hybrid

Nah bro we making money
People here don't know how SPACs work. We're seeing the DA announcement runup. It will fall back closer to NAV until right before the merger. LCID(cciv) had a run like this right after the announcement and held for longer than expected, but eventually fell closer to NAV and didn't come back near the highs.
Stop
Soon may the mango man come

I still don’t even know the ticker. Crushed it on AAPL calls though
Orange man thank you
Is DWCA banned in this sub? because I haven't seen any posts...
Lmao, the bubble of the rest of the world outside of bumfuck flyover state where your best marriage prospect is your sister? It's a real big bubble out here.

For those who keep asking the trump ticker is $JAINA
It’s a bit of anti-trump sentiment, a bit “but how!?”, FOMO/jealousy, and then finally, for the big boys, some people probably didn’t play because there are no options and they feel like they’re missing their shot to play with the price rising so rapidly. 

Folks are weird, brother.
In your mom’s basement?
Not around here in Saskatchewan. All I hear about is layoffs.
Don’t worry if you stay long enough you’ll loose all your gains from 🥭
need that Hunter Biden spac
Really makes you question the *"priced in"* theory
Have you seen what sub you’re in. It isn’t r/investing
They still trying to blame trumpet 🎺 for everything
We just hit 70! 🥭
Calls for mango man the second they are available. One week out or less. Make that shmoney and dip out. Easy as pie, no ifs ands or butts about it. No further discussion needed
Because past returns guarantee future returns.

$CUNT
When it comes to market pumping nobody does it better than 🥭. \#StockDebutGoingWell
First ones free. I did the same thing with gamestore. If you have RH upgrade to gold so you can trade pre market. If it runs hard tomorrow in the PM I’d sell some and take profits. Don’t get overly greedy and bag hold a lot of your gains away. See what it does tomorrow, I wouldn’t want to hold a lot of it through the weekend unless it continues to pump all day.
Orange man good

Lol 😆
I got banned for making 700% gains today and trying to share it with you
Were info so quick? Is that English? Look take this as a lesson that you were smart enough to not buy into the pump before the dump.
It's inaccurate. I've been on this sub for ~2y. Although I can't remember when I first became 'active', the 1yr badge and 9mo flair are just wrong. I'd rather be flailed 'pigeon' or something meaningless than carry this on my username. Can you please put anything else there or just simply remove it?

E 'flaired', not 'flailed'
Idk but i bought some LOL!
Gamble on what? D-whack?
🖕
Obviously. I caught on slow
We’ve known about this Apple ad thing for months and the stocks don’t react until now. Wall Street is really just a bunch of lemmings who can’t think for themselves
🥭
It might be like GME at 350 and a lot of baggies being minted with DJT seal on their foreheads.
What the pawg doin’?
I’m back at ath but still feeling fomo from mango
You have to be trolling. Just look at your grocery list, everything is more expensive. Look at gas prices and real estate. There are jobs galore, particularly low skilled labor. There are patty flippers making $15 an hour some places now.
It's not about getting in, not about the fun of being in. The most important thing is knowing when to pull out
Fukin Sofi. Fuk
*Spirit Animals are back on the menu boys*
What ticker
I'm glad for the people who caught the Mango pump but there's zero future potential for that shit. Who the fuck is gonna use it? 30% of retards who want to spread conspiracy theories unchecked? It's literally Parler 2.0 and do you know anyone who made it past high school who uses Parler? Get the fuck outta that garbage before it dumps and live richly off your gains.
Damn. A lot of haters in here. Either sold too early or didn’t get on the ride at all…This is WSB. Why wouldn’t you gamble on this???
The S&amp;P 500 has been up 7 straight days. It hit both a new intraday and closing record today.
If  🥭  stock and aapl situation causes the bubble to pop tomorrow I'll literally be the happiest I've been in my life.
Aye!
Supply is even worse
What in the bloody fuck is a warrant?
i bought some SNAP after hours and sold 30 min later after it recovered a bit
We've seen this show before. It's more likely that the commons come down than it is that the warrants go up. But my crystal ball is defective AF and nothing makes sense when it comes to the former guy.

It just won’t stop going up 😍
Yeah it’s related to spacs. You should look up info about them because I’m not going to be able to explain it as well as others but right now I’m treating them like regular shares
remember that scene where Danny runs into those twins with his tricycle.. that's TWTR tomorrow.
Me too, I was gonna buy $10,000 worth but SPACs have been shit for so long I only did $5000.
It’s about someone he hates and he’s on the sidelines watching. Let him fume
I like this name more than the generic shit they came up with 😂
Yeah for sure stonks go up
Fuck it I’ll throw 10k at mango at open. I feel like I’ll regret it if I don’t. Wouldn’t be surprised to see it hit like 10B market cap if I sit out.
No no no. SNAP took care of that already.
&gt; we should be showing them on a leaderboard that is updated every day
Usually takes a few weeks
Just like that, Gonzo89 was Gonzo.

Yeah let me sell first
Heard hunter biden bought 🥭 warrants at $.50 yesterday.
Fomo'd into some of DonaldsWetAssCunt. We'll see what happens
If each warrant can be exercised for one share of 🥭 at 11.50, then the price of the warrant is meant to include the premium between the exercise price and the current price of a 🥭. Which means the warrants are like 30 dollars undervalued compared to 🥭?
I have no idea how inflation can be up.

Didn’t receive a single cent of stimulus. Housing market is terrible. Condos are 20% below 2008 prices. Employers are cutting jobs or slashing wages. The few that aren’t are giving out 0% raises.

Where is the money coming from?!
I've found success trading actually. If you're not stupid it can be a viable side hustle
I'm stuck in the dryer 🥭-Chan!
For some brokerages, you do have to sign up for it. Not all though.

I have fb calls so idk about that chief. Lol
Me too bro
Yeah but not a direct correlation.  The big players yes, but most apps aren’t making billions in revenue from ads, and the ads they push are not hyper targeted because they don’t already own all your data.  I think FB earnings is not going to be pleasant.

Im absolutely riding puts down to 40 and then calls up past 100
Oh
Nice
Ripster called this one out from the 30s and it has printed, rebounded nicely the past few weeks. Good fundamentals
I'm staying away. I can't see how the current valuation could possibly be justified, but at the same time if I was able to short it I wouldn't dare, the market is really irrational.

Mods absolute clowns on this sub total joke
&gt; You're a fucking idiot.
That’s what I just said
quantumscape?
M-A-N-G-0!!!!!
Yeah. From what I understand about it, and given it current trend, it's basically free money.

I hope I don't regret not buying and staying in it today to play earnings. But, I can see this growing with time until he dies. After that, god help us. LOL
Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

Just a friendly reminder:

“Looking at it another way, Renaissance Capital’s Kennedy notes that based on his data, 70% of SPAC IPOs so far this year are trading below their $10 offer price (that’s through September 15, and includes those that have announced and a few that have completed mergers). And of the SPACs that have completed mergers in 2021, 58% trade below their original offer price, according to Renaissance data.”
We’d be well passed $475 if it was
Just bought a single share of DWAC at $69 for the kicks. Trump stock to the moon.
He’s hedging his bets on a vintage comeback
Well, It’s in Deep South., they don’t care about the gyna virus
Random story that will get buried, but my first ever stock years ago, was the free one I received with Robinhood, when I still used them.

It was (APPS) Digital Turbine 
Around $5.

Ad agency for IOS apps (or something of the sorts)

I’ve bought into them ever since, and It’s now almost $90. It has great company numbers for those who want to do some research and find something new.

*just a redneck who messed around with sports betting and stocks, not a financial pro
Don't buy it then
Very interesting, and looks like good news for Wework as well. It very well could be low risk with high reward. He already owns enough media companies to supply it with loads of content. Even though it looks like it won’t be his hands on the wheels

Do you have to sign up for AH trading or you just go to sell after hours like normal?
You just pick and choose? What’s the point if you don’t list the ban bet I was egged on to do it ffs and you don’t list it? Wack as fuck
Don't be mad because you missed on opportunity, enjoy it with the rest and move on
This I would like to see.

What is a company dinner? I thought those were cancelled years ago due to cost.
awww someone's sad
Tomorrow you’ll REALLY need to see a doctor, LOL
Bless Brandon’s little heart
 “Why are this many people buying” are same ppl who asked “how did he win ??” .
Damn right, I’d rather miss out then be bagged out
I will go for you, free food. After dinner I leave.
Ad rev and apps devs not the same category at all.
At $14 I almost put in 5x what I put in. I am thankful for the tendies made, but sad for the tendies not made.
But I have to..😕

And here I was, making fun of TRUTH last night. 

I’ll never doubt you mango senpai
Don’t attend it. Nobody’s forcing you
This type of gamble is the heart and soul of this sub, but you wouldn’t be able to get over yourself long enough to understand that.
This is bullshit I placed a ban bet for $70 and they didn’t list it wtf mods.
Jump back in
Me neither. They opened up a location thats supposed to be the biggest in the country less than a mile from me
Easy in, easy out is how everyone is suggesting you play with this ticker. Only one holding the bags will be people hoping in too late.
That SAM yolo post made a lot of sense. Too bad it got fukd
Yeah
no one except Pelosi
I know the moment I buy mango stock it’s gonna dump so y’all have fun
At least you got grifted by the best
Im smoking mango juice vape
For everyone having FOMO about mango, keep in mind that the VWAP for this is still somewhere in the low $30s. I still think this thing can go to $5-10B valuation minimum on hype/fomo alone, but there will definitely be profit taking when the market opens (it did another 50% move on 5% of the daily volume). Also as long ownership settles with brokers, more shorts will be available. The only thing worse than buying a mango stock is bagholding one. Hope that puts your hearts at ease.
Really regret not buying mango stonk 😢 could’ve tripled
🤣👆

Glad I have AH trading in Ameritrade. 

Usually it burns me but not tonight. Easiest few grand I’ve ever made since GME

Mango will cheer them up
They probably pumping mangos shit rn
Are you retarded?
Brandon approval rating dropping and all these tech apps are tanking, inflation high asf too. Bravo orange man, couldnt of picked a better time to launch it , all bullish for this stock
I can trade till 8pm eastern because I don't use a shit broker.

That's the way out actually
Sector wide rotation across ALL tech.

This is snapchat. Not a sector wide problem.... At the end of the day, tech is still where money will go.. What do you want to invest in? Fubo?? Small caps? Trumps pump and dump?
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
A ton of brokers let you buy AH. Just not Robinhood
I wonder if they will be down for 60% tax brackets  to pay their fair share now…

Lul

I bought in at $12 check yourself Anal😤

Lol insane huh
People are annoying, we need another pandemic
So my Put sells aren't fucked? Thank god i'm down $13k if it goes down to $444 tomorrow
As if 🥭 followers aren't gonna pump this ridiculously high just to make the news cover it constantly. Easy money on warrants. This will become a movement for sure. Gme style

Imagine a subway, but instead you get your own personal compartment, and it makes stops at specific destinations instead of every station. 

Then imagine that you have to hail this compartment with your phone and it’s still driven by a human.

Then recognize that there are only 700 compartments which worst case scenario are used even less efficiently and only have 1 passenger each.

I can totally picture a timeline where I say "in before 70" and come out the other end a millionaire
GME doesn't have a benefactor behind it who likes to suck all the value out of everything he touches after people have dumped their money into it, though. At least not like this one does. LOL

&amp;#x200B;

I totally see what you're saying, though. Who knows how long it's going to run for.
THANK YOU PRESIDENT PUMP
And this means what exactly? Fb is not snapchat son. Never have been.

After hours don't mean shit but makes no sense.
Imagine thinking 45 was the top
It's trading at 82 now.

SNAP is going to put me in a hole tomorrow. Never doing earnings again.
You better give him so many rimjobs, he could afford 10 of you by now if he would have got in at 18.
Ricky don’t lose that number
DW🅰️©️
It halted like 4 times today
I don't think it's a viable business so I would not expect a return on investment.
They're coming for JPOW. Next Fed chair gonna be a blue haired college prof.
lmao $70, no one saw this one coming
No lean hogs den
Fuckin RIP
Puts on your relationship
LOL yeah, he can do better
I wonder if they will turn off the buy button tomorrow lmao
I'm buying puts on fb and Twitter because if snap can be clapped by Apple all social media can
Shits going to close at 69.69
I’m feeling frisky, maybe I’ll go check out that new White Castle next to the house 🤔
I agree that’s endgame but don’t underestimate how long the pump can go - look at GMe
What u mean? Lol
Same revenue models
Add a 🥭 to the ticker
Oh I guarantee there are people on here who think it's a hold... and there are probably a large number who aren't going to time the exit right even if they know it's a pump and dump.
what should we teach 7 year olds, critical race theory or how to buy spacs
Donald Pump in the house
I don’t even want to live right now
Just Google his name + spac I think mods aren’t happy with people posting the ticker
Must not fomo... Must not fomo... Must not fomo... Must not fomo...
I convinced my bf not to buy 🥭 at $18 cause it was too risky and did the same when he wanted to buy again at $44. We’re not talking now
Haven’t you seen Brandon’s approval rating
Watching my SPY calls print
Just fomo'd into mango at $69. This IS the dankest timeline.

Add a w to the end of the ticker
This.
And, with FB's woes, too, I can see a lot of those dollars going to Google instead. Google should moon after ER on its own numbers. I'm buying more calls 5-6 months out.
Don’t forget trailing stop losses
Algos gonna do what algos gonna do
Nah - go on Parler I dare you…it’s just kkk crap.  When it first launched it was a common thing to see people complaining about FB and saying they tried to get their friends and family to move to Parler but no one would, so they couldn’t delete their FB.  People don’t maintain both, and even the most racist grannies want to see the pics of their grandkids.  People will join this but there won’t be active engagement
I can’t believe your eyes either. I don’t see that with my eyes.
Add a W to the ticker
And it probably will with all the media attention it will get tonight
are we going cash gang tmrw or do you think the market will shoot up within the first 30 minutes
That's a meme stock, no fundamentals and connected to one of the most hated people in America

Wouldn’t it be hilarious if mango runs another 300% tomorrow?
Everyone is saying it's a pump and dump. No one is planning to hold this for 2 months, let alone the whole 2 weeks.
Dude it’s not even launched yet. Chill
💎 🙌
If it had options I would buy the 100 strike daily.
$dWACK
Me too….
I appreciate you thinking I’m intellectually superior, but I assure you I am not. There have been many very useful responses that where obvious, and I never considered them
I’d rather live in a box outside Trump Tower, than take that vaccine.
That's not even true...
Opening would probably be a good time to sell TSLA, right?
What’s really crazy is if I woke up early today, I would’ve made ONE MILLION DOLLARS
I bought 800 shares at 37 and paper handed it a minute later for a 3k loss. Fuck
Thanks man, I can sleep now.
Maybe when they hang out in the Hampton’s they might laugh about it together?

Why it smell like badussy in here?
Exactly. The knee jerk retards who sold will be gaping when others buy the dip. Ridic

Lol if you have nothing useful to add don’t comment back to him. Pompous as fuck 😂
Lol mango’s new social media site is already shut down!!!
get vaxxed. your 460 isn't going to hit tomorrow (i don't think you realize how bad that snap miss was for tech, and what it means), and your gonna be a whole lot broker if you have to pay rent.
🤣
Probably having Ramen after losing my shirt on calls during every red day thanks to Gyna.
Snap bringing down QQQ is so fucking weird.
It's not googl so this is sus AF
AMD owns them
What’s really crazy is if I would have held onto my baba and MRNA calls I would have been 250k richer right now
I mean, isn’t what’s bad for SNAP good for other social media? All that advertisements didn’t just “disappear” they just moved to other platforms
People saying no crash because everyone is expecting a crash but VIX at lowest level since before the pandemic 👻
Today SPY was somewhat ugly most of the day and QQQ was up. I’m fine with the opposite tomorrow lol.
We have other places to go, lol
Baba is not exactly looking stupid lately.   Could make a nice run before earnings…
Whatever seems logical, do the opposite…
Donald hit 80. Can't believe my eyes.
Orange is the new GREEN
His press release literally mentioned he’s working on both ventures. Social media and traditional news media. 

Hate him, I get it, but at least read past the headline.
tbh at a certain price point retail cant help pump it anymore so we'll see what happens
whats the move tomorrow?
I'm going to cut his dick off and boil it in hog fat
Meanwhile, tilray pops and drops
This is why I doubt he signs the deal, he'll just find someone to give him more money up front.
SNAP just fumbled the ball in the 4th quarter. I think the 2020 October W pattern just initiated. SPY 500 EOY just a little detour
If mods ran a bot and banned everyone with a mango mention it would be like Thanos snapping his fingers and half of everyone disappearing.
Yes. It will
Figure it out for yourself
Ha. Jody. Thats a name I haven't heard in a long time.
Everyone’s sleeping on PE tickers, leaps on the mega funds are free money, saas like margins, Blackstone with a huge print this morning, doubled dividend too🤌🏻

No, Trump Co stock became worthless and was delisted many years ago. This new venture will end the same way.

Has mainstream news ever questioned Nancy about her options plays? If so do you have a link? Please share
Just a MASSIVE rug pull after hours 

A lot of people thought SNAP would deliver meaning juggernauts like GOOG and FB would also deliver…..

Look how they loaded up with both hands into GOOG right before close and SPY/QQQ 

Tomorrow will be ugly 🥰🧸
walter bloomberg fucking failed me. where was the mango notif? i, nor many others on this sub did not know about dee wack until it was up 100%
i'm sure others will pump it for him though. I bet this thing does another 300%+ tomorrow.
bought some otm november calls today. looking like it was the correct choice
Wake up early for pre market it may go ham. How I maxed my game shop returns in round 1. Pre market pump was joocy
Nobody is selling mangos for a long time
Hey those are fair points. A few months and you’re done. Good luck!
Las Vegas is run by morons

I’m worried it could only lead to more polarization. There will only be one opinion the platform
[deleted]
I don't care who you voted for in 2020, this is mango money we're talking about.
To think he could have started his own news network and take Fox News out of business. But no. What irked him was that Dorsey and Zuckerberg both banned him from social media and he couldn’t tweet anymore. So he’s now starting a social media company 🤣
Glad I sold half my snap calls today but imma lose a cool 1k on this drama
INTC boomers will never financially recover from this
I made some money on it earlier today and the mkt cap is really low but the investor presentation reads like prestige worldwide

sold some TTWO 185c for a nickel

next day they're at 1.65 cause 5% jump. 3200% increase. but I don't care. go ahead and hit 185 tomorrow and then cash me out, been holding this shit like 5k in the red for a year now, I'll take 3k profit and walk away
I think it’s gonna be locally hosted. Cause they also want to compete with AWS
well you’re obviously autistic, and they’re rolling out DNR orders for mentally handicapped COVID patients so i’d say get the triple vax
A lot of green insurrections today
I do.  Bought it pre market and bought throughout the day.  Love it!
To be clear I’m happy for everyone who will profit I didn’t hear about it till after hours. I don’t like the guy but I don’t much care for all the tech companies I profit on anyways.
no options no buy😤
His app isn't even ready.  And it's valuation is $1.7B at $10.
It hasn’t stopped running yet. One of them has gained almost another 100% AH. It runs another couple days at least. A lot of people missed it today. I bought at 9 sold at 11.50. Then went back in at 13 against my better judgement and I am going to hold until I see it fall substantially.
Gamma squeezes are a real this thing too. If an options chain came out on this it would go ballistic for a few weeks.
jumped in end of day, already double
Same in Boston, it’s great for the community. and people still talk bad about them
Why not tho
Trump Co has a market value somewhere around $10 billion (if it were post-merger today with all extra share thresholds reached)... not sure I have ever seen anything like this.

This is like BYND or TLRY on steroids; even they took a few weeks to play out to this level... this all happened in 1 trading day.
Ok Kyrie Irving.
Remember when GME was at $30 and AMC was at $10 and you said to yourself “Well, no point going in now”.
legacy media is dying.  Trump gave them huge rating while he was in office, effectively keeping em on life support.  Now he is gone CNN FOX MSNBC are back to 2015 levels of viewership and will now continue the scheduled decline.
Na damage done. It will trade flat
Depends where u bought.
Want some more gasoline with that take?

Good lord.
I have no calls on AMD, but over 7k worth of stock
Nah dude, not with all the money flowing to the Donald pump stock
LOL
RIP Intel boomers
It's too bad Trump got his ass banned cuz he can totes pump it bigly right now on Twitter

Everyone knows what will eventually happen but in the mean time it's pump pump pump.
Damn. Rip mate. Bite the bullet then to stay home and keep saving. No shame in that
So one iphone change killing everybody's company now? 

Picking up some Google tomorrow. Chicks still love YouTube
Parler fell apart because it too was deplatformed and removed from all app stores, not because it had a bad business model.
Gonna 💩 verbal gold for the next couple years. 

Although very possibly profitable I’ll be on the sidelines for this one
Got warrnts at $6
Right!
Saw this on Twitter.  Could go with another spac.  Maybe that one would have options lol

Noting that I don't see definitive documents filed.  And...we're talking about a counterparty who has one of the most self-centered views of fairness history has ever known.  Just be careful of the risk Trump re-trades this deal and thanks $DeWAC for the price discovery
Guidance probably lowered
Yeah without an options chain I’m not sure how hard this can really pump from here
AMC :(
that new social site will be dropped asap from whoever decides to host it 🤣🤣🤣
Facts. Based off your first comment you sounded like one so I assumed. I getchu now tho, my bad. Make money gang 🤝

Grabbed 22c 🤞
The SEC just released that GME and AMC were NOT short squeezes, they were just retail investors. This Donnie stock could ACTUALLY be the first short squeeze. I could see it getting to like $100 - $200 in the future, liberals getting mad and shorting it, then his followers going fuckin crazy squeezin it
I do kind of want this to be my biggest play of all time...
Kicking myself right now for not taking it seriously.

Should have YOLOd everything, but instead I’m mostly tied up in stupid BABA calls.
I will call it MineSpace
$COIN $COIN $COIN you are an everlasting light.  You are a squeaky toy for a young pup, you are mother's milk for an infant, you are a conjugal visit for lonely prisoners.  You are the smoothest pebble that a male penguin could find.  You make this Earth a home.  Thank you $COIN.
I am rock hard
I've been rotating calls all week and almost sat this one out since I try to avoid playing expiry dates these days, but bought 2 119/121 call debit spreads just before close because I felt optimistic and wanted to do a little gamble LOL. Woot! It's not much but it's almost certainly gonna be gains!
🤡
I never should have dismissed the market powers of DONALD PUMP when I saw what was happening in the $40 range today. F
WhAt aRe YoUr MoVeS tOmMoRrOw  my fuckin moves tomorrow are watching theta bleed the options I wrote dry as some poor fuckers asshole bleeds until they expire worthless. Same move everyday Pinky
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
I’m actually confident in it. If they do it right it can be extremely profitable. Especially an AWS competitor.
Don't forget the University! 😄😄
Yuge
My portfolio includes both. More elon though
Meanwhile Mango warrants are up over 2000%, that was the real play.
"Trickle down economics"

Are we allowed to say, I, no, my portfolio missed 🥭?
Massachusetts too expensive man. I am too young to afford the true cost
That's the TRUTH
If the logo isn't orange, I'm gonna lose it
Is google going to shit the bed on its earnings
So SNAP is just going to casually go down -20% tomorrow?
Not a maga "cultist," but feel free to inverse me.

I don't mind seeing people like you lose money.

I hope you bought Calls in INTC, for example, because I bought Puts.
I make my own broth and stir in half a can of mixed vegetables. 

Grew up poor as shit lol.
[deleted]
Don’t Fomo, don’t fomo. Don’t Fomo. Oh well. Here we go
the whole reason trump ran in 2016 was to promote his own news network after losing.  He never expected to actually win the fuckn thing.

So this has been in the making for 6 years.

Also, being kicked off twitter is just a little side hustle now.  He will have his news network to compete with FOXnews with a smaller social media app to slightly compete against twitter.
Yoooo there is good money there. Trump is very good at monetizing
Gonna be some epic 🥭 loss porn when this thing inevitably dumps
66 and Tucker hasn't even started
😂🤣. Just use less seasoning
Why did he do it?? She seemed so nice.
Never had it to my knowledge. I’ll try the test thank you
I thought they said a while back that they were getting effected and their stock dropped. So priced in?
Thanks for allowing the emoji fun, it has been a fun day. We love our 🏳️‍🌈 mods.
I'm leaving politics out of this and staying vague because it's easier than argiing with team red and team blue (I'm not even American so IDGAF)

Pro: It promises to eliminate censorship and promotes free speech. 

Con: No censorship means it won't be advertiser friendly and will attract trolls meaning it won't be a great place to visit and the userbase will be small (see Voat for an example of how this will play out).
I'm sorry but I'm selling half these "shares" at the crack of dawn.
He shoudlve jusr SPAC’d
Just like the Patriot Act or War on Drugs
Burry and Cathie both go long on Trump media, stock market implodes.
They are few and far in between, friend.

Again, wrong sub. You're just circlejerking your own perceived intellectual superiority when you can simply just go google up the business plan yourself.
It really is all about the dividends. INTC is basically a retirement plan stock, or a risk anchor stock. (though obviously that's not working during earnings lately LOL)
Get vaxxed lmfao I’m in the opposite position I wanna get vaxxed but can’t cuz then I’ll have to move out
For good reason
just get the vax bruh, you will instantly regret not getting it once you get kicked out.

SPY 500 eoy btw
Couldn’t care less, these monkeys would push this shit so hard if there was an options chain. shOrT sQuezE
Half of Facebook's 2.8 billion users? You a retar d?
Make Stonks great again
GME is way overvalued, but at least they have revenue. This is just some SPAC with 🥭 claiming he’s gonna make a competitor to Facebook. It’s just a pump and dump bullshit scam.
I mean it was low 50’s December of last year. So basically a year.
I’m gonna join this retard next week with my ban. Same bet
First they'd have to figure out how to turn on a computer.
bought at 13.43 sold at 25.76 , bought at 42.50 , waiting.
Can someone tell me when is SPCE lock-up expiry??
Nah, might dump some more at open since SNAP announced after close today, I would like to get in under $2700.
Got in at 18.88
Seriously though, that’s what happened.
Treason to what?
Tell your parents to fuck off, but don't say it until you have somewhere else to live.
I never thought my first 3 bagger would be a stock and not options
Yup the float is so low it could easily hit 150
Solid.
There are lots of very intelligent people here with a wide diversity of opinions. That’s invaluable
you know the SEC talks about us by name at this point in print and on the MSM, can you let us stick to our guns while letting you get away with emoji stuff? I don't want to block your fun, I just want to protect the fort.
Just get vaxxed. Be protected. 

Your parents care enough about you to do it.  Im living with a roommate and i was almost kicked out if i didn't get the shot. 

Stay with your parents, make bank on market buy house. Get vaxxed
Get the vaccine and stop being retarded, or if you want to keep being retarded, pay for the shoebox

It's not that your parents are liberal af, it's that they have a brain unlike you

GOOG A/C and FB 

Good luck tomorrow 🥰
I can’t believe it.
There are gonna be soooo many bagholders. LOL
Life exists outside the bubble, comrade.

Money is money.
Think about all the rabid Trump fans and wanting a 2024 re-elect, probably immediately monetized too…
kind of like bagholding pltr but a little classier
The discount is gonna be there always for warrants anyways.
Tech getting rekt after hours. SoFi drops 2%. Rip.
Doesn't even have a signed deal yet...
then you know the fact that it's "higher than twitter" means literally nothing
Wtf?
So my 🧠 isn’t as big as I thought
$2k/mo for rent sounds super expensive and you have like 0.2% of dying getting the vax.
Fuqq your parents niqqa. Authoritarian cultists. Just get a fake vaxx certificate. Plenty of them to be acquired.
This is brilliant
depends how strong your kidneys are
Oh ok so snap causing a correction
Fuck the SPACE rule and fuck the mods there is no viable reasoning to not mention the 🥭 stock
Say what you will about the homeless people in LA, but most times I drive by them, I see them looking out for their local community by vaccinating each other frequently
Why are you asking WSB apes to explain mango's business plans?

lmao

Wrong sub.
Damn. Didn’t realize this many people in here still have a hard-on for treason. This thread got super weird.
How’s is this even a question?
its mostly competing with FOXnews which is down like 60% over 18 months.
11.50 but I paper handed early
He is the only reason the media still makes money by constant stories about him, endless coverage. His presidency boosted their profits probably more than anyone else in history, so that’s one
this is a pure gamble play. personally i'd get another shot for the money. can you deal with having an extra arm, or maybe 1 working lung ? yes . you can. if you die? big deal, can't use money anyway.
Agreed. This is the $30 GME point
But the Steaks are good, right?
Buy the $INTC dip? Don't mind if I do.
Just move out and enjoy life. Living with parents sucks regardless
Does mango have an options chain available on it yet?
Yes that's exactly what's happening
[deleted]
Still low next to companies that exist, yes.
M A N G O F O M O
Everyone has bias. I genuinely want a reason to by it tomorrow. If the company is solid my opinion of the man doesn’t matter
Bro just do it. Literally free money
Mango media warrants printing lmaooo
It’s just another scam. See: trump airlines, steaks, casino, etc. I’ll eat a ghost chili raw if the platform is released and endures for more than 3 months.
Healthier than starving to death.
It's gonna be very big, the biggliest, smartest social media platform. Very smart.
**Someone's selling 10 to 20 million shares of AAPL every day, you can see the block trades like clock work between 12 and 1:30 pm.

Just done with work. WTF happened to SNAP?

These thots all on Onlyfans?
Mango options.

Do this for me. Do it now. I need them in my life.
Tell your parents to stop being Lib cucks.  Then buy a ton of DWAC and get ready to own a room in the nearest Trump Tower.
Yes I know that…
AMC has touched $40b market cap and has consistently held a $20b market cap for like 5 straight months now. At a $1.6b market cap, mango media is just getting started imo
Why play snap calls at those prices?
Was so excited to get home from work so I could Jack off but then I got home, ate, and the desire left my body.

Bernie Trump: “I am once again asking for your donations”
Need your boys opinion. 

Parents are liberal af and want me to get double vaxed or else move out. My argument is there is no need to over do it.

Either I get another vax live rent free or moveout and pay $2000+ for rent for a shoe box.

If I moveout I can’t yolo deep OTM SPY calls.

Any advice is welcome. Hoping $460 hits tomorrow for an 18K bagger.

You should have been here on the night of November 3, 2020, when the results started trickling in the they thought 🥭 had won. They were celebrating so obnoxiously. And then reality set in the following day 🤡🤡
Remember when $HOOD meme’d? Pepperidge Farm remembers.
$16.75

Thought I was late in the game but boy does it run
Bought 17.67, sold 50.18. No regrets.

VIX at 14 is a gift for bears my god 🤤
$SNAP is on sale right now!
Higher than Twitter now lol
Better long on Mangos 🥭
Is SPY even doing well adjusted for inflation since the pandemic started? Or does that not matter since due to this kind of event, we *should* be printing a lot?
ehh, if you play it right you can make some quick bucks from those.  gotta find the ones with momentum and just get in/get out quick.  almost always profit from the run-up to news
Yes, trading options on a leveraged fund doesn’t add more leverage cause IV is inherently higher.
Seriously though. Who has under 18 of orange buy in
You mean Mr. Pelosi?
AMD for the win tomorrow.
It's not going to be a serious platform. It's just more chud gruel. Who SPACs before they have any semblance of a company? Profiteers without a business plan, that's who... and given who we're talking about the fact that that was his grift for like 50 years, it's just one more time to take advantage of people and create a new generation of bagholders. Solidly 90% of the people celebrating on this thread right now in 2 months are going to be posting "If we just all work together, we can get it back up to $6!"
I’m in amd atm and up quite a lot. I might sell before earnings tho. Lots of retail think AMD is continuing to steal market share but I still think there might be supply chain issues across all semiconductors. Might sell my shares tomorrow.
Ron Howard’s voice?

be thankful it’s not still at $52 pussy, it’s recovered almost 10%

Still a SPAC. IMO Spacs over $2 bil should be able to be talked about. But nobody asked me.
Wow. Maga stonk is madness. Options are going to blow up sky high
I thought futures would be more volatile than this after the AH tech dip. Looks like they're going to walk the dip back up.
Happens everyday dude

That's when your confidence is hot, and they probably do. feelings go both ways

Apple and Google will never allow trump's social media app in their stores. Maybe Google might but Apple won't.
I’m looking for calls honesty.

Loading up with both hands tomorrow
Buzzed hard
Trump demographics are mostly 45+ confused adults who hates facts and science. Might be good for advertisers.

Also the website looks like what it would cost someone 10k-20k to build. You know they overpaid for it.
it depends on whether they beat earnings or not. if they miss they'll go down even further. It doesn't look good for them rn, but unless you have insider knowledge it's really tough to know.  


All the pros were predicting an earnings beat for SNAP, and look what happened. if they can't even predict accurately, how could we hope to?
Is he on truth social yet?
No more dirty Laundrie
We can post Donnie ticker symbol now since it's over 2B right?
Take the penny at open
Holy crap , I was this close yesterday from doing some Bearish SNAP call spreads ,  and my order didn’t go through 🥲🥲🥲
guh OCGN. I want the over 4 hour erection where I need to seek medical attention not the twisting knife. Hopefully tomorrow.
When you walk around and think every girl likes you when they see you
No one is going to use it because there is no one on the other side to troll.
No one is, nerd
So rev for snap is 1.07 (year before was 678m) and WS expected 1.1b … eps expected .08 and they reported 0.17 … this drop is way too much
woweee
Nope, Intel's last ever split was before that.
I already made money on that today.  Classic pnd
ya same. it's just too difficult, too stressful, and it fucks with your emotions. so easy to make plays you didn't even mean to bc you get greedy.
I sure did haha 😂, wish I hadn’t but I can’t predict the future
Sold at 48 myself, didn’t want to risk the Friday pre market

Thanks for making me feel better. I didn't know such retarded people were my enemies. I thought I actually was doing something wrong, but I know now it's just insecure manchildren crying about nothing.
Cramers head going to look like the Sankara stones after reporting on $DW4C
It looks like it’s dipping due to SNAP’s reduced guidance.  If it’s still down in the morning, might be a good buying opportunity.
dividends maybe lessen the blow
It’s alright man we get it you sold 😩
is this what they mean by emotion is the enemy of investing?
Yes

**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/donkey199** bet **AMD** goes from **121.29** to **130.0** before **2021-10-28 18:52:51.556587-04:00**
Splits, dummy
No problem! Good luck! I know that feeling! 

I don't have the capital to play in LEAPS at the moment, but I have changed to doing more rolling options strategies, like doing tighter debit spreads based on resistance points with the intent of rolling them after they gain. It's slower than trying to hit big, but you get more turns at the play and I've seen more consistent gains having a target to get out at, even if it's not going to give the greatest gains.

There are lots of options strats for different risk appetites.

I like the "screenshot rule" ... basically, if it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to sell. I think it kinda works the same way if we think to ask if we should sell on WSB. That means we're nervous about not selling, and that's a sign we might want to take some risk off the table.
You already missed the boat
Do you understand what goes on here?
Snapchat shareholders legit lost a year of gains in 5 minutes 😅
Why is my ban bet not listed?!
If you believed in 🥭 yesterday you would've 7x your investment in one day holding STOCKS.

Crazy times.
!banbet AMD $130 7d
Well  I am a tard that’s likes to buy spy puts so wtf do I know…
If SNAP is $120 Billion market cap I guess it’s plausible that TRUTH goes much higher.  I just doubt the ability to retain users and build a coherent ecosystem.  Parler fell apart quickly, people have too much invested in Facebook at this point and aren’t leaving for a platform where most people would never associate with.  Even their pitch book says only 1/3 of Americans would use a Trump platform.
LOL. This is the retarded 💩 I came to see.
Not sure the time
Low volume movements to all time highs are not good entry points. Tomorrow is gonna be a pullback to high 40s. What a wild day
Market cap is still low in comparison to AMC/GME $40b market caps during the mania phase. I say triple digit stock price is imminent.
Advertisers and con artists will see that user data as a goldmine. It’s basically a treasure trove of data on the largest collection of gullible people on the planet

I sold every speculative position I had except for SOFI, T, VZ and annual cyclicals building up to next years dividend. Holy shit, what a good move. Bad news is I need new plays, and haven’t got a clue etc is going on anymore.
I did what it said to do a ban bet but I’m not seeing my username in the current ban bets wtf mods
They need to make these ban bets longer… like 1 month minimum
Wow what a high iq move debit spread
I don't hate you actually.
Jeez oil got buttfucked today. Let me guess it fell off of no news whatsoever? Most manipulated POS commodity there is. The media will flip the same story on a positive or negative light depending on price movement after the fact
Wow that bull never stopped .

Looking awfully bearish in here. That tells me my calls are safe tomorrow unless I inverse myself. Or do I inverse WSB. Idk anymore
Trump is going to monetize the hell out of that social network. I’ll bet there will be a gambling section
Fix my flair
Deff going to get wrecked
SOFI probably isn’t going anywhere tomorrow, right?
The stock that can’t be named, in order to cooperate with this benevolent Chinese funded app, is up another 30% after hours.

I’m adding more GOOG to my Roth in the am. Earnings gone rip next week
The aim is FB 963 b
Or at least twtr 52 b
Before November 4
waaaahhh ?

/u/walter1021 (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1000.0 when it was 858.03 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Yes

When ?
Same but 885’s. My debit spread puts got blown up but if it drops tomorrow ill buy higher strikes and date them November
It’ll be 500 a share by then and then it’ll lose like 30% and still be above 300 lmao

Still a DOW component and solid if boring company. I’ll sell put credit spreads, just edge lower to low 120s little blue
This is most likely a pump and dump…. But once more news drops this will go higher, so it depends how long you want to hold
Same, I’m good either way though. Except flat, no way that can happen after recent events right?
I fukin hate that stonk
Guess I’m buying GOOG tomorrow![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)

Yeah it is. Sell off into weekend. Getting puts at open
$TSLA told us a long time ago ads are for losers and we didn't listen.
Does 🥭 have anything left tomorrow? I’m thinking yes because of all the media attention but it probably won’t be as drastic as today
Gonna buy me some of that
Considering some of the stories I heard about people having their BYO Bronco getting sold from under them (literally people test driving THEIR bronco when they got to the dealership), and the dealership saying the other people were willing to pay more… you’ll get fucked by the dealership somehow
Got some Tsla 870p fd down about 8% will see if they print 🤣
shit i said fuck it and bleached my hair for the first time. thats where im at with life rn
Yeah
Donnie pump is back.
Can’t be that cool if you are looking  at your phone.
Have you watched the older versions or read the books?
nothing, it's literally an infinite risk to reward ratio and the absolute worst risk you could possibly take

With that said, I bet TSLA to 1200 in 2 months
This is the big brain takeaway from this.

Kinda like taking commissions from salesman tbh
Bingo.  Social Media is already a tough market to break into, right wing ones all seem like a flash in the pan on top of that.  I ain't touching that pump and dump, but good luck to all that do.

!banbet SNAP +10% 7d
Exactly, I'm a dem and still made money on that trash today. It's not personal, it's biddddnessss.
Seriously. Why the fuck is WSB still banning this ticker foe?
Awesome example and explanation, I'll look more into that and try to do this in the future. Always tough when you're in green and trying to make that decision whether to take profits. Always feels way worse seeing it drop red though haha, that approach might help me take some gains while keeping some skin in the game. Thank you.
I agree but saying it's dumb to think that ad revenue will decline is dumb because big companies already said it will.
Good luck with that in SF, _today_

It really feels like she relies on her 20-something analysts to find hype stocks she understands little about and then waits too long to jump in sometimes only to get scared off at the end.

me and my dad arguing about whether Trump’s Tendie Maker  has more room or not. On the one hand, 1.69B is nothing. Iron Net reached 4B at the height of the mania

No kidding. I had INTC on a separate watch list titled “Too High Now”. Last time I checked it was trading at like 63 months ago.

dontttttt give a shiiiitttttttttt
Well, it may work a little bit different for LEAPS, but the idea of rolling options in this example is to lock in profit. Let's say a stock is trading at $10 and I buy a $15 call option, then the strike moves up to $20, but I still have time on it... I may not want to lose all possible gains moving forward, but I want to lock in my profit, what I'll do is basically calculate my reposition by looking at which strike/date combination I can buy to give myself the same basic potential for profit as it moves up more. That way if it dumps I don't lose my gains... I highly recommend using an options calculator to figure out which one is the best to roll to in order to  get the best benefit if you're not sure how the Greeks will influence potential gain should it keep moving up.

In this example, I might buy a $20 strike call and sell the original one, which will reduce my risk significantly (at the cost of reducing some of the delta and gamma I might benefit from, depending on the option strike I choose).
I did that and sold months later at 50% loss. Pm me for strategies

It is possible the failure of Gab and Parler combined with his multiple business failures and the delisting of Trump co stock years ago is the reason some avoid investing in him and not politics.

Mostly flat lmao but I survived lol. Hope you had a good day to broheem
It just keeps going up lmaaaooo
i lost a lot of money today but at least it wasn’t cuz of snap
ivertendies
Trust me thats next
Maybe?
C’mon CF, let’s show them the facts
Thanks buddy
Makes sense what about if held until merger as it’s still a spac

If you ever feel like a retard, just remember that r/NKLA is full of bullish investors 🤡😂
I made 230% today sold most of it. I’m gonna be watching carefully tomorrow to get back in. This could go up 100 or down to 30. Who knows
u/cashflow_ I hope you understand that I will slander you and beat you down every single day for so long as I breathe. I also respect you.
Not a chance. She'll buy it at $200 and then sell at a 60% loss after it dumps 🤷‍♂️

Looking good

What is the stock?
Not total dogshit but dogshit
&gt;The Federal Reserve announced sweeping new rules for its top officials Thursday, banning trading in individual stocks and bonds.

But I guess Congress, Pelosi, can still trade not only individual stocks but options on it. 🤡🤡🤡
Thank god I’m holding nothing wrong now. All I see is posted about dumping and the end of the world
[deleted]
Markets would be down 5%  at open if we got to 1.8 10yr overnight… it’ll be a bad day if we hit 1.72 tomorrow going into the weekend
Why is this not financial advice? Are we not on a financial sub?
Reasonable indeed. Thank you cashflow, very cool
Me: yeah, I think buying a stock that shot up almost 500% in one day sounds dumb. Maybe after a dip.

WSB: haha. You stupid libtard. So triggered 🤣🤣🤣 You got so owned today!

I can see the brain cells dropping day by day here.
Isn’t tonight supposed to be something going on With evergrand?

Well I sure hope you’ve been doubling down this whole time because tomorrow is payday!

I saw it and could’ve bought it at $14 this morning but I thought it wasn’t gonna do shit. In retrospect I made four dollars selling my snap calls before market close. So I got that going for me.
Mmm cum

I know there’s some DIDI bag holders here, today was glorious. Closed out my position that I opened near the bottom last month.

I love living on the west coast. I’m awake and chilling with a cup of coffee every day at market open and don’t have to go to work until it’s been open for like an hour and a half, uninterrupted trading. It’s beautiful. And I take an hour long lunch starting at 12 every day so I get all of power hour too
The crash
Going to check back in 10 mins once all the AMC apes have gone bananas
Got my 1dte SPX 4545 puts @ close. Absolutely fukin no fear. What a crock of shit these last 7 days. 🍻
Boutta go down 80% the minute it appears on CNN
Probably not as much, everyone falling because apple cut them off at the knees with the privacy stuff.  FB mentioned on last earnings call it was going to be a problem for ad rev.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Thx for your insight😀
Crazy how much $5 buys you behind Wendy’s
No news which is why the drop makes no sense. I think here is a crucial turning point. Either we run up or down for a bit. I think up is more likely.
EPS was good. Revenue slightly down. Possibly large investors sold because the stock was running up. Tank it and buy it again maybe?
Oh god I wish
Why we dump so much AH?
They would make you think that was the top. SPY ATH tomorrow boys
Heck yes!!!
Damn straight comrade

Attacking me doesn’t change nothing, whatsoever. It only shows the content of your character, retard. By looking at how many dislikes you got, people agree with me.
Did someone really short the company associated with TFG or is that fake?
Cuz 🥭 pumping
look at RVLV, I held from 10 to 58 and kinda wish I still owned it.
These absolute 3-inch choders that are selling BB after hours crack me up. This will be 13 EOM, 20 EOY.

BAN
Buying a stock after a 500% pop seems reasonable
And Apple is just hanging around like nothing happened.
Fuck your privacy, that data’s ~~gold~~ BTC
BTFD
At least it was just a ban bet a bunch of people went deep with calls.
Would bring back my respect for her if she bought it sub $11
I hate cramer and vlad.
Sublease that shit, find somewhere further from city center that’s cheaper, and pocket the $400
Either way I'm fine with it
We'll wake up and 🍊 will be worth more than fb

Nah, AAPL dumps for supply chain reasons

I would use my old iPhone to take a picture of the snaps on my new phone.
Pro tip from a recovering spac-aholic- set up news alerts with your broker. Don’t rely on social media.

According to RH, Mango's market cap already passed $1 billion so we should be able to mention it.
Spy has a chance tomorrow.
Can’t if this thing had options guys would be retiring. I’m glad it doesn’t tho because I think it will hit 100 plus
Burry 🍆💦 all over the growth bulls if you right.  Don't be right, K
Playing SPY puts right now is like seeing a roulette table posting a big streak of black numbers so you go over for that easy guaranteed red number. Literally works every time, it’s just simple math.
Maybe it was the first time some certain mod saw it. You need to figure out who to hate specifically
I just need these last few plays to hit and then I'm gonna go full dividend gang. I've had my fill of options

Nah, he off himself then the gators had a feast!
Is 🥭 still a buy tmrw? Be honest I haven’t had a chance to look at it
Same. I’m all cash (what’s left lol). I really do think we are going to visit recentl lows again but not yet. I am betting on Oct 27-Nov 4. Or we continue to climb. Will see
Crazy how little $100 buys you these days. Crazy how little 200k buys you.
Doesn't it notify the sender when you screenshot?
Somewhere low 60s.
I feel like I’ve earned the mango flair. Even though I hate the guy
AAPL is the reason they nosedived. New data privacy on iPhone blocks 3rd party apps like FB from tracking you and selling info to advertisers
They were okay. This is an overreaction as always. I do think that Apple hindering their ad business can have further repercussions though. Again, an overreaction nonetheless.
Trying to get life advice from my boomer dad is so dumb. Like dude you grew up jerking off to magazines, fought in vietnam, and had a wife, house, and kid by 27. None of ur shit applies to me.
When you love money more then politics you know you're based &lt;3
$AAPL killing errbody

Idk. First day pump, cool but I'm not trying to be left with the bags
Biggest Bear trap of all times in the work....loving it.
Got a feeling we touch 1.8 on the ten year tonight
What BS tickers are pumpers pumping nowadays?
You're now $100 richer, congrats
I genuinely feel badly for people that don’t believe in BB. To get this stock in the neighborhood of $10 is an absolute fucking steal. It should be 100% of everyone’s portfolio. Combination of shares and leaps.
“They” r fuk!!!
Investors don’t care whether or not they “like” what apple does. It’s about whether it not it makes them money.
Apple is having success withholding valuable data to other companies in the name of privacy. In reality, they’re probably keeping the data for themselves or at the very least, taking away an advantage of their competitors
You know what always happen after a 25% discount.
Can you elaborate on the idea behind rolling up? My call is an ITM leap for June next year, at 92.50, and it's unclear what the advantage is in doing so. Thank you in advance if you have a minute to explain.

I fucking hope so, been so long since I've had a win. Just bleeding money left and right.
Lordy the IV will be insane when the options come.
even if you don't love the guy the market cap is fucking ridiculous
The good news is that if this keeps up, my SPY calls will be so trashed by open that I won’t have to worry about selling them
Some kind of news fucking finally happening? I’ve owned shares since it fell off a cliff, but Jesus this flatline is hilarious. Someone buy this fucking company and put a hit out on Sherry Redstone before she can speak
Delusional bulls think FAANG imploding means ATHs

Turned $1.8k to $5k on 🥭 today. Feeling the FOMO here AH for sure…
It's still a SPAC. They signed a definitive agreement, but haven't merged yet.

Half the country loves this guy
They all rely on each other to make money it's not that complicated
Oh gotcha, but wouldn't it be a possibility that the sentiment becomes a "wow I don't like aapl for doing this" and maybe other people don't so they sell? Idk I'm looking at the fear card here. Market is irrational after all. I dunno

Big buyers came into the 10/29 77c and 80c over the last few weeks and no significant amount were closed before ER. They're either totally fucked or they know the price is going right back to where it was if not higher.
Great forum to ask this question.

It's getting pathetic when you jump from one r/investing psalm to another. You're wrong about $NFLX &amp; $TSLA btw and you're gonna enjoy a 7 day vacation from this sub, and you know what's sad? You will leave and you'd still not get why you were wrong, you'd instead blame it on *"the craziness of the market"*, because it's much easier than admitting to being wrong. And if you still don't get why $SNAP is tanking, then I can't help you. Google *"Dunning–Kruger syndrome"*, that's what you condescending r/investing bers suffer from.
🐭 fucking resilient at 170
🥭
serious. I bet it does another 300%+ tomorrow just because it's trump, 50% of US won't admit he's not President or lost. I'll gladly make money from that.
🥭 gone look at Twitter down 4% after hours and convince himself its bc of his social media company going public  lmaoooooooooo
SNAP
Why oh why did I ever go long a Japanese company. The Japanese cannot experience days that are a touch red so it always winds up down &gt;.8 percent. So many traumatized paper handers. Yes, their indices peaked sramatically in like '89... They keep being a bitch it'll never break through that record peak.

Love Sony as a company and their prospects scream multibagger to me... But fuck the conservative trading style of japan.

Not financial advice
Phun
God dammit closed IWM 10/25 228c at a loss and it hit my target AH
SNAP said they don’t expect lots of revenue growth due to apple clamping down on ads and strengthening privacy. That effects FB and Google who rely heavily on ads.
Not apple
LOL, east coast loser that still has to work 🤡
That’s my bet. $460+ EOD
A SPAC is a SPAC until a merger is complete…
I feel ya. Calls on your mental health.
Apologies for being a dick; you didn't deserve that and bringing up personal stuff was low of me. Best of luck to you too, see you tomorrow.

Lmao they ain’t buy even 1 share of 🥭 cause they triggered 🤣 they hate money
Don't underestimate the number of idiots who literally refused free money just because orange man bad and they could never support it
Cult movies in Sweden lol that’s cute
i still think it is still the possibility of that germany is legalizing. Alot of news article are here since election.
FB is down because of snap 🤔. Looks like a buying opportunity

It’s about the making money not supporting the guy you fanatical retard.
They provided negative guidance for Q4. Risky at the moment for sure
why fb when you have googl
I routinely comment the same shit so nah. If they were gonna arbitrarily enforce some rule then do it the first or second time not the 10th time I post the same comment
Why? You tarded or just making a funny?
My moves; Wake up, poo, drink coffee, coffee poo, make money, go into the lab to make a difference, leave early, do blow, get drunk, get laid.
I actually don't, was in the gym and missed a lot
I just called them. Their landline has been disconnected
Uhhh, ummm, nvermind
Snap gonna have people on snap benefits soon
The recession cancel has been canceled. Recession will resume tomorrow.
The funny part is SNAP was around $18 pre-covid.  Even after this AH haircut it still aint bald.  Rocking a mullet now.

I submitted my order to the local dealership but does that guarantee they will accept the MSRP price?  
if so, why would anyone buy the ones being advertised on the dealer websites with crazy markups?
Yeah but it could've just as easily gone to 100
So I dont get why you’re saying the pump is weird, things probably going to 80
Any reason why the marked died AH

Sharpen those claws BEARS steaks 🥩🐂 the menu tomorrow 🤑🧸
Ad companies are going to be just fine lol. Some will adapt, others will perish. If there's one thing that's consistent with anything internet facing, it's that advertisers get their grubby fingers deep into everything.
I am sure FB, Google will find way to circumvent AAPL’s fucked up adv data blocking.
Has anyone actually seen the mango app? Shit is literally a twitter copy how is this even legal lmaoo
They're going down cause of aapl. If anything aapl goes up from taking capital from those companies
Buying truth after the dip in AM. It's at 1.5 billion but still a SPAC? 400% increase in one day so I'm guessing not a spac after today?
Maybe it wasn't the content, but the repetitiveness

Holy shit watch my 449p lottos strike gold tomorrow picked them up for $15 a piece. I hate it here.
Because investing in someone will a multitude of failed businesses behind them is the only way to make money in the stock market…
A social media platform of people that hype each other and will buy anything to support the cause is the most clear demographic ever to make money on, if you can't see this business model then you don't deserve money
You are fine. No worries.
Will do. Thanks friend
Someone is sad they didn’t make money today
So Biden putting on the Superman cape tomorrow and lifting the whole market?

Time to add mango stonk to Nasdaq/SPY to save the markets tomorrow.
Not I not?
200 mil I think
Hopefully snap hits sub 50 before open
?
Let’s blame 🍎 and the transitory government instead
In my personal opinion if i was in that spot I may start looking at grabbing google. I think the correlation in this event is less than what Fb is and can move more than FB.
All that SNAP YTD gains lost in one day

Knowing that stock and this market it’s back up at 75 in 2 weeks
They’re magically delicious 🍀
How come? Facebook already said that last month I think and now SNAP and you think other ad companies won't suffer from that.
Watch Midsommar, if you haven’t already. Ask u/cashflow_ for review.
lol west coast loser. My toilet break on works dime is timed perfectly every day at 9:30am
I’d be happy with either one tbh but I’d rather Trump for president with desantis as VP and then desantis take president for 8 years. But if he does end up becoming president literally nobody would complain lol

Sorry for missing your point.
sky is the limit. think about merchandise.
I hope SNAP was a warning that the “sure thing” momo stocks can splat on earnings too
It's up 400%.. you must not like money, why are you here?
That's some premium, grade A salt getting tossed your way. In ancient times, you'd get paid in salt and wouldn't see that much in a year.
It was a good day for sure. Should’ve got more.
Just think about when they offer the secondary and dilute 500% or something crazy
Probably watch a movie after some studying and then golfing in the evening. Idk about y’all but those are MY moves for tomorrow lmao

Nah, fuck facebook. I would gather facebook has much more reliance on ads from the iphone where as google still has many other means to get ad revenue.
Just don’t be left holding the bags for someone.
what happened? any news?

All the rent in the building increased about 25% since July. This was the cheaper places too
It’s far from over.  I bought a small amount in the morning just out of curiosity.  Should have gone all in
Let there be cake 🍰
🚀🚀🚀 AMD is hitting 150
Get him bot!!
That guy definitely has problems
This happened to me last time and spy turned around and popped up green and my puts was fucked. I'm not falling for that again so 457 call it is
Debt ceiling deadline - Oct 15th

Debt ceiling non priced in SPY movement - Oct 4-7th

11 days before deadline SPY jumped

31-11 = Oct 20th (today)

Biden Infastructure deal deadline - Oct 31th

Infastructure deal non priced in price movement - TOMORROW

Calls on Biden using executive order
No fucking clue what so ever. 100% gonna need a roommate next year
I really don’t wanna wake up at 630 to stress the up downs of the first 10 minutes….should I just put in a buy order for 🥭 at open and hope for another 400%?
Of you think about it it's Apple really bringing the market down
Eh i think its overblown on googles end. Looking like a good place to get in.
I like $$$ though
Be born in Africa
Well he may have shot himself in the foot with all the lies.  Can't see the FBI or really any of the powers at be allowing him to have a real platform again.  It would be the end of Democracy if he got elected again.  His second coupe attempt wouldn't fail.
For better or worse PayPal is somewhat linked to Pinterest for the time being and I expect a decline in Pinterest from SNAP’s ad-rev issues
&gt; You are welcome. I'm sorry, but I do not take kindly to people who make less money than me and call themselves poor.
What will happen to my spy calls? Find out on the next episode of dragon ball Z
Did you flip the chart upside down again?
Emperor of Mars
Well my SNAP calls are absolutely fucked. Guess I’m glad I got November expirations.
Don't look at futes
Do you not understand how options work lol.
You wasted a comment to call me smart?

Thanks!
Load up on VIAC after hours
&gt; No, you're just a boring, spastic, constantly-wrong mongoloid who somehow thinks a picture of you in bed with your retarded dog redeems your failures as a man. You wept about leaving this sub yesterday, make your parents proud for once and actually live up to your promises.
  
This is what I have to deal with literally every day in this subreddit. All I did was post a pic of me getting ready to watch Dune. It’s nonstop.  
  
I keep saying it but honestly one day I’m just going to be over this place
  
Like spend your time making fucking money not trolling people. This is America. MAKE MONEY. Unreal
Made a years in rent off the market this past year. Not sure if 20% increase in rent is worth it tho lmao
Holy fuck no one cares about your emperor who cheated and still lost in January. Fuck that stock and his fan club of 18-24 yr olds in here.
Next week should be fun
TLRY is mooning my ape friends
It’s a symptom of a concussion. Google it and be very careful please.
I seriously wonder how much money a donald trump company would make that’s whole goal for revenue is people donating money to Donald Bc you like him. My guess is At least 50 bil a year
[deleted]
Personally think his dad and him went out for a hike and dad honor killed him
Wtf is going on after hours? Why is everything red except for Truth?
Tempted and trapped by BB calls yet again, sigh
You can physically say whatever the fuck you want using your dirty Trump jizz encrusted mouth. But now you have a problem with PRIVATE companies when they ban your führer?
so - snap buy in open shares?
Oof
What is 🥭 ?
[deleted]
dude, it just keeps going! i love it.
Bookmark it https://alpha.earningswhispers.com/calweek
Up 300% on my mango hold
Sounds like someone missed it. And sorry to let you know many will hold it no matter wat.
I'm serious. If the market price is driven by buyers and sellers, then if hedgies dump 20B worth of shares, then the market would need buyers for the other side of the transaction? The buyers are other hedgies?
Really scary shit. Not sure if I should stress rn
Holy shit rip teq
Lol
Fucked bro I pay 700 for a house. What the fuck is going on down there
If I skipped out on buying paypal call at open and used that money to believe in the orange man I'll be up over thousands and not down
If you honestly think telling someone "You're not in reality" ISN'T an accusation, then I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Hunch back shoulder RIP
They are just trying to see if some sucker will give them 2050.  Doesn’t mean that’s what it rents for
They’ll go blackout until weekend so they can fuck the markets monday
[deleted]
Go make money, moron. Instead of trolling people online. Your priorities in life are stupid and you suffer because of it. Anyways, blocked
Holy shit GOOGL and FB took a nose dive off the ugly tree ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) I'm assuming aapl will follow suit during PM Tomorrow?
Nobody complained when one banks good earnings made the other banks stocks rise before they reported
How can you buy AH?
SDC still not leaving🚀🚀
SNAP ded
Now that they found Brian Laundrie dead too, it's safe to turn this whole thing into a Netflix docu-series.
At least TLRY went up AH
Just drink tons of booze until you pass out. When you wake up you will be gone
Speaking about presidents, what does Elon do from 2024 and beyond
Damn.  That would be nuts.
Uh, 👍
same. sold all my tech calls at the EOD.
imagine day trading meme stocks but you're still bagholding pltr
Rents are up 20% YoY nationally. Thank the trillions in helicopter money and the Fed money printer.

It was sweet while it lasted!
You wasted a comment to tell me Google it? Smart.
Lol why are you asking me. You’re taking to someone who just had his portfolio basically wiped within 3 min. 

Yes... yes you should.
20%+ increase in a couple months. 

Just be happy you got it wen you did.
I’m just gonna let him figure out how etfs work on his own time
Sounds like variation separate is back
If I had held my SNAP 83p from about 3 weeks ago I would have more than tripled my account on them.
Not fucked at all, rent yours out for 2050 and move to Colombia
I think it’ll open around 65?? And hit 100s tomorrow I’m about 300% profit rn might get back in and see what happens
Shittt
Who is this Donaldhino Pumperino guy?
AMD 

SU BAE

Belieive
And VIX below $15 😆😂🤭
Should I buy more at this price ?
There are millions of maga and its market cap is 1.5 billion.  It will take nothing to explode
Is it though?  AH still higher than open.
Who don’t have a home theater? Poors I guess…
Sold my MSFT at the top before close. Was sad at first when it was up 2 dollars AH but happy now.

May reenter  if it drops good tonight/ tomorrow.
If Evergrande fucks up tonight tomorrow is going to be one blood red day
As a point of reference. It is a fact that you can be overtly communist (as far to the left as possible) on all platforms, but anything slightly to the right gets banned. That’s why I said that if there is free speech for commies, what problem have you got with MAGA twitter?
That’s one deep shoulder….
PLTR should buy SNAP to better spy on people.
No, his girl fiend murdered him and then murdered herself. Plot twist.
her ghost ate his ass
not it's not the hell are you talking about?
I got my apartment in august for $1,660 a month in Charlotte. The room with the same layout next to me just opened went to market for $2,050. How fucked am I for next year
Usually when there is such substantial sell off, some if it gets recouped before market opens. This will be 60+ in am do buy shares
Sorry guys fb dropped because I bought. Lol
FUTES GREEN
you go first
Which is pretty dumb.
It does every earnings.
Not looking at market, $T 26c--$CLF 22c--$SPY 449p....how we looking?
Can’t wait for Puts to magically appear… 😂
I'm confused.  Did this Brian Laundrie guy kill his gf and then get murdered himself?
Unlikely
Did all the 🥭 comments break wsbsynth?
Why do you think this
Theranos is just Thanos with an ER.
I think the most frustrating part about the stock martlet is the fact one stock can bring down a multitude of other stocks. Like tf this that. Realistically that doesn’t make any sense imo
Fuck SNAP
&gt; make money on the way down when there aren’t options yet

[Uh, there’s a way to do that.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)
Not as fast Laundrie
Nasdaq getting PUMMELED in after hours. Taking my SPY tendies away
Snap guidance is low because ad revenue is down. Ppl are extrapolating it to google’s ad business.
4 mile walk at the park or 6 mile walk around the city?
SPY $500 EOW. Laundrie found gonna make stocks explode.
SNAP crashing everything AH.
Me for sure
And they may lose more. Because posting images is not that hard
I’m not trying to spam negative stuff about 🥭 but the investor report is must read comedy. I’m talkin TMC level bad![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Some retard I know who just got into the market sent me a SPY chart today with a fucking head and shoulders pattern with 270 target 

Love to see it
Lol I keep saying that  but I am fucking sick.  Was about to throw 2k when it was around $23.  Shit is now $57 after hours and probably going to 100 at this rate
Lets Go Jack Ma
Exactly lol I think I just have a problem of being stressed out
No, you're just a boring, spastic, constantly-wrong mongoloid who somehow thinks a picture of you in bed with your retarded dog redeems your failures as a man. You wept about leaving this sub yesterday, make your parents proud for once and actually live up to your promises.
Let’s go bers let’s go hoo hoo
Have you considered…..

……….*googling* it?
I’m literally becoming more convinced by the minute that mango is gonna be the greatest pump and dump in the history of the markets.

Idk if you're serious or not? Do you understand the definition of market cap?
Market Cap is just current share price * outstanding shares. If they dump fast enough the supply overrides the demand, causing heavy loss in market cap. They don't dump 20 billions at once necessarily
Where are you checking? It's at 1.702 on marketwatch
So I can buy a bunch of it in the morning
[deleted]
i heard about it this morning on CNBC as they were dismissively talking about it. I bought 20 shares at $12 just to see what would come of it...
Wtff
Fb dropped because they are likely to report the same issues during their earnings
I want the money and the paid 2 weeks off I get for thanksgiving and Christmas lol
Last week was fake af
Are we gonna wake up and have 🍊 more that fb?
No
My move? Letting my 5DTE NDX bull credit spread expire for them sweet sweet tendies

It may not be exciting, but it’s profitssssss
SEC gonna look away on this one
Yields
That’s the most retarded reason I have ever heard in justfying buying puts
You seem to have brought up “commies” first for some reason 🤔🤷‍♂️
Dude.

It is.

lmao.

NBC lies on Trump all the time. Go do actual research on your own, Jesus christ.
Im fucking brawling tomorrow. Ive got CLOV 8 puts i sold expiring along with CLF 22p and 19p
Now is the time to ask.

Who is fuk tomorrow?
Only to those who don’t understand the concept of a market cap.

Facebook calls with this dip?
Nepotism is so awesome
Snap went down faster than me behind Wendy’s for $10
10 yr yield almost at 1.7
Rolling out these 10/22 SNAP $65p/$62p and $63p/$60p Credit Spreads is gonna be a bitch in the morning. I refuse to get assigned or close at a loss.
I'd buy a few at the 425-430 strike.
also...500 million volume...what was GME max?
Bought a couple shares of the trump spac at $56. LFG
It is bullshit if SNAP brings the market down.  wtf
People are extrapolating that the decline in advertiser’s spend will be across the board and not just limited to SNAP
Hey, retard, I was talking about free speech only. If you like FREE stuff so much, why do you deny people FREE speech, huh?
[deleted]
The Don website continues to go up 😂😂
No wonder if dropped even more… 

Here’s to hoping PYPL drops the deal and shoots up
Will it be okay ?
anyone have a good list of companies who have earnings next week? iirc Facebook is monday and AMD is tuesday
I've never been up ah +10

Makes me anxious
Brief explanation on why $GOOGL is taking a shit?
Sorry must be [fake news](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/amp/ncna1239828)

I’m not going to waste my time further with this. I’m not political. I call a spade a spade. He has publicly (aka known facts not assumptions) failed more often than I would feel comfortable trusting. So my investment dollars won’t be going along with anything attached to his name/brand
Ha! Gayyyyyy.
Please say sike tomorrow at 4 am spy
Many people are saying this, smart people.
&gt; How do you leverage yourself if you were jacked to the tits on Facebook calls? 

This question makes absolutely no sense.
If you want to find out how racist/non racist you are, go to RH and check this stat: portfolio diversity.
Hope my Intel calls print tomorrow
i mean.. paypal lost more than that and all they wanted to do with buy a company lmao
We going in on Facebook with this dip or nah?
This guy has snap calls I can tell
I still belive in my ["banbet TSLA 1000 1w" from 3 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q8w7y6/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/hh1h99r/), placed when it was 849.0
I'm a poor winner, I can't help but brag when I make money in the markets. As a loud mouth, I'm concerned people will resent me when I retire in my twenties as a multi-millionaire
Turn it off and turn it back on
How do you buy AH?
Somehow your infrastructure and social security = not commie. 
Got ya 👍 i totally understand now bro. Wow that makes so much sense. You’re amazing.
MEGA gains.
calls on COIN after SNAP destroys SPY?
How is unity not hurt by the snap effect on companies that rely on mobile advertising. A big part of their revenue is ad sales on iPhone games.
Have you seen his trades? He already rich.
Lmao same with Disney. Dumbass bots!
Fuck off you bloated spastic
If swaggy stocks has 🥭as a ticker , it will be number 1 in ticker sentiment
SNAP lost 26B market cap AH what the fuck is that
Always. AMD to $130
🥭 may have doubled his net worth today and he was already bigly rich.
Don't go to sleep
That’s why he didn’t flee the country to Mexico right away before anyone knew what was going on. Took his time and came home, said bye and went out to kill himself. It was his plan all along
fucking JPOW sold 5 million dollars worth of options on the dow just before it went down, google it.
There go futures lol. Easy circuit breaker. How the FUCK did Snapchat actually just bring the US market to its knees? I don’t get it…
Well I was being sarcastic. I was basically saying that people will get tired of paying subscription fees for everything at some point.
How do you leverage yourself if you were jacked to the tits on Facebook calls? They expire December, but it’s about to wipe my portfolio come market open. Double down and buy more calls for 440? Snapchat is gay and only offers gay ass shit. No one cares about it. Facebook actually has something to offer, so I don’t see this staying down. Hmmmm
Why mango 🥭 warrants flying? Robins can’t even buy them.
also ATT for ESPN
Donaldgrande
I’m a bear so nah
SNAP collapsing like that is kind of significant
Fuck it, bought another $5k worth of 🥭s. Let's go Brandon!
I am Orangeman...snaps fingers all social media crashes....
Yes. Not taking 1250% on a call before earnings would be a greedy thing to do.
Just one more please.

this whole thing is corrupt af, but it's the only way to get a real retirement. The feds are all insider trading, as are the politicians. Options are manipulated af (check opex dates if you don't believe me). I'm done trying to win at a game where all the odds are stacked against me.

How does that work exactly? Do hedgies dump their 20B stock position in one trade?

Wtf are you on about, retard? When the fuck did I mention healthcare? I simply said that having a platform that doesn’t ban anything right of centre left is good for free speech.
TLRY
Oh yeah, it was talked about it earlier on TV. 

Brain fart.
SNAP is now only down -22%. It's as good as green.
Buying at 11 selling at 55 not bad at all!

You first.
Talking to a client of mine and he was shopping for an Escalade. They told him 6-12 months out. 

He asked about a used one w low miles. Only one they could find on their network had 5K miles on it and wanted $130K.

Snap isn’t even in the top 10 holdings of SPY and everyone is freaking out about no ATH for SPY tomorrow
Let me be clear, I was *not* trying to counter his claim.
🥭 on 🔥 LOL
Social Media is different. People won’t pay. 

Millions of people decided to drop out the workforce cuz they got tired of the bullshit. I wouldn’t bet on people paying for basically garbage. It’s ok maybe when it’s free. At a cost, it better have value.

He clearly thought that Evergrande was going to close a merger deal with Tesla, then send an assassin to kill Elon and burn down the giga factories! No other logical way to explain those strikes.
Why does RH app use so much damn battery? Oh because it's a game app.

Snap calls at open? That drop was massive.
😬 I know haha thank you friend
Could be a case of snap blaming apple but people putting the pieces together and seeing that it’s a nascent decline in advertising spend and this is just the canary in the coal mine. Could also be that the snap earnings miss is just giving people an excuse to sell after a good run from the beginning of October.
INTC LMFAO 🤣
Already bought, down
I should’ve mentioned it’s for 6 people. But American and delta are both $1,200 for 6 people
but does it matter if theyre cheating when you can play both sides?
Made good profits today, thank you president Trump

TLRY coming back from the depths of hell I see
ya I'm starting to get serious 1999 vibes from this market. feds and politicians insider trading, tech going up wayyy too much, China in deep shit, I'm out. Gl all of you.
Somebody go out in the woods and tell MAGA about mango stock.  Let’s pump this shit
They love their anti-elite message…no better way to stick it to the man than by making him rich.
Is there options on mango 🥭 man stick, I wanna buy puts.
As much as i hate the guy, yes.. i feel a shift coming
When I saw it mentioned on my ig feed this morning I was like YEEEAAAH and then....

&amp;#x200B;

And then I saw the whole thing about mango and I immediately checked my bank to see how much I could afford to lose for my $100+ yolo target, deposited it and went balls deep

I'm sitting here bamboozled by the irony if SNAP causes the collapse of this bubble.

MMs literally played a game of SNAP and winning, that would be a story told a thousand years from now AHAAHAHAHA
Just a big buy I guess, no other explanation since it fell right back down

trump's spac is great for profits. Ride the wave up (cause it's going up) then ride it down, in the future, as everything the man touches inevitably goes to shit.
Yeah I downloaded it and already watched it. Just sharing

I thought I made mistakes before , this is definitely a mistake.
mango warrants flying

Ya but y didn’t the social media stonks react yesterday?
Nope I bought 45 DTE puts and got blown up.
Is there any way simpletons could have known about this even early this morning?  ...with 10 spac nav it was super low risk, could have easily put whole 401k on it for a day.
It's like you've never banked 150% in a day on one stock

To the rules man one trade cannot exceed one weeks pay
When I started trading I would do so much analysis of my purchases that it was insane. 

After the whole GME and meme stock craziness I've converted into picking a direction on random stocks and buying FDs like a roulette wheel. 

I'm not doing as well as I used to. But I'd be lying if I said I don't enjoy this version of stocks way more. 

Come on baby! WeWork, I know you have a history of being shady AF, but I just bought calls today so let it ride!! Pick a direction and run for daddy!
I’m inclined to believe that dozens of millions of MAGA boomers will catch up on the news over the weekend, dump MSM platforms and pump MAGA stock to the moon.

oof that snap miss hurt. No more trading for me. My port does great when i don't touch it, so I think i'm going back to that.

Always remember, you're playing against ppl that are cheating. THere was a lot of insider selling before this miss, dunno why i didn't take that more seriously.

4. Sleep stress free with bank earnings/more when Biden drops the bills tn or tomorrow

5. Sell calls at $460+ tomorrow and send lambo dealer

You know.. the more I look at the chart. The more I'm starting to think that those Intel calls I bought today for earnings might not pan out how I thought.

Funny how all social media stonks tank the day trumps social media stock goes public
For the Halloween season, a theory: I feel Zuck is basically Dr. Frankenstein at this point. He looks at his creation and feels disgust and shame. Hence the name change, the metaverse talk, etc. He knows he can't destroy it, it is out of his control. So time to create something new.
That’s what I’m looking at too - are you kidding me? It could be 10x that easily
Isn't it ironic, don't ya think.

The post-covid rally started when SNAP gapped up 30+% from earnings in April 2020.
Depends on what income level the bar is
Owned it for the yield a long time ago and bought calls back in the Covid crash, cashed that shit out yesterday for 1500%
Bro don’t tease me I’m already so hard it hurts
I said you're not in reality.

Which was apparently correct, since you somehow interpreted in an accusation from me I didn't make.
Like that would be a bad thing. Some ppl really have no business being on social media. My 82 yr old mom who accidentally went live while her nurses aid gave her a bath is a good example of one.

Snapchat is fresh shit. Negative net income for years with a Total Mkt Cap of 118B while only bringing in 2.5B yearly revenue lmfao who in there right mind would buy this dog shit.
It’s because the mango man social media conglomerate is taking on AWS. Look at the prospectus.
Wish I saw Facebook AH when it was down to $315 - $317, we’ll probably never see that number again 😪

Parlor?  I think its called.

Trump never went to that or promoted it.

Him starting a new thing, with a large tech firm backing.  Is much different.

Also, this has been in the works since 2016.  I think the only reason he ran to begin with was to promote his new news network.  Not expecting to actually win the presidency.

This is his network to compete against FOX originally.  Now its expanded to be in compitition with Twitter as well.
Um, buddy? You're calling Trump/Republican supporters cult members without knowing anything about them, while lecturing me about strangers and about not knowing anything about you. You also don't know much about Trump -- a stranger to you -- seeing as to how you ignored all his successful businesses.

That is called projection, yes. In fact, that's ironically a cultish thing to do.
IBM $140 1/21/22 CALLS were trading at $6.30 yesterday, $8 last week.

I have a question, why is it sometimes spy will just rocket the last 10 minutes before close?

Is it people buying options for the next day or what?
I'm not a bear, but when I get puts and the target drops, it feels sooooo good...
Its the junk in the trunk for me
Yes I do think you can make some money, but at these prices, hedge funds will salivate to short it.

Current price is valuing this thing at like $10bn post merger...

Uh oh that sound good scoob
What is it exactly that I’m projecting according to you, internet stranger? His financial failures are well documented. You have no knowledge about me. Maybe you should be less presumptive…
I agree it’s coming, but the theme of this rally was solid earnings and we are having that. If next week google fb etc earnings are shitty, then we get the pullback, just my 2 cents.
More like 3 months
Tomorrow Nasdaq opens down -7%.
they have public transit that alleviates the need to drive literally everywhere.
Remember what happened to "I forgot their name twitter competitor" after Trump and his goons flocked to it to talk about election lies and tAkINg BaCk tHe CoUnTry.  They couldn't find a web host that was willing to be liable.  How will this time be any different?  He's spreading the same insurrection garbage baby tantrum that he has been since 2020.

Looks like so many tech companies will miss earnings estimates because of Apple's new rules. LOL

Tim the tech killer.
Imagine not buying bito at close knowing 2nd etf launches tommorow
No
Currently ~$2b
I wouldn't touch it, just saying there's no possible viable business there.

Trump branding can carry this story for a while.

This kind of thing can go for a couple days but eventually it will get a rational price.

This is like another TMC.
cool now they ar equlaualy valyooed
PINS ER calls
No it hasn't
What's probably going to end up happening is that QQQ and TQQQ are going to be slightly low at the open and that's going to generate buying, which'll push AMD et al up even further... AMD's flying AH. This isn't a total tech sell-off.
The fuck happened to snap after hours? Is it because i deleted my account today?
Is holding an already 12.5 banger F call through earnings greedy?
i don’t even have enough to give to the money bank
True but until then its coke and hookers
I don’t wanna tout BB in here anymore because there are so many doubters. They deserve to miss out on the mega moon that will occur here before year-end…..
So have we found the best meme? The greatest meme even of all time?

So what? SPY is a tech etf, it doesn’t revolve *entirely* around what Biden says or economic catalysts. Some days it just goes down when it seems like it should be going up based on economic factors. Some days shit is happening that you would think would drag it down and it explodes anyway. It’s dropped almost a dollar so far after hours. It would be cool if that passed tomorrow but even if it does that doesn’t necessarily mean SPY will explode. Hopefully they do pass it and SPY gets a pump but you were saying this same exact stuff last week, “it’s definitely gonna pass on Friday and save my calls”
I yolo’d into spy 452.50 puts 10/22 just before close. Trying not to get my hopes up. Expecting this to be bought up in the AM. But I may be the wallstreet genius
Yes because volume is insane, and hedge funds have gotten smart and learned not to fight big volume (see CLOV/SDC and the rest).

They know how to bring these things back to rationality.
Mango phones
I know this is WSB , but I'm playing it safe in this market. Bought Jan 22 calls on CVS and HBI. Actually did my research for once and both companies are undervalued with decent upside.

1.5 B market cap is joke, upside is there big time.
I made a bet about snap going to 80 after earnings see y’all in a week
Not exactly defenders. They just want the data for themselves and prevent their competitors from accessing it
Idk if u watch American news or not but this thing is coming faster than u think
With the really down market at open, it'll be hard but I wish you luck. Probs will be closer to 905 if we're being hopeful
Lol I'd be fine with that
How much does a good prostitute go for these days? Asking for a friend.
My FB calls are too.  "Oh there goes $100k in 1 second because SNAP missed revenue but doubled earnings estimate".  Market makes perfect sense.
I’m glad I FOMOed SPY 30 minutes before close scalped a sweet $15 hunskies

No it’s not, it’s 1.80 euro/liter I don’t know where you’re getting your numbers from
Same thing that happened to facebook. Where you you been?  It is all snaps fault
I didn’t get in until the mid-40s.  Sucks.  Put $450ish in there, maybe I should’ve put more since this might have legs to run up quite a bit, but I also could see it suddenly dumping hard and losing thousands of dollars.
It happens to small caps and micro caps all the time but not that very often to companies valued at $120 billion.
its its even a somewhat of a compitition against twitter it will do well.  Its gonna pull a lot of people from FOXNEWS who are down 50% in ratings.

I think putting it at 20$ range is fair this year.  See what launch looks like in February.

Half a BILLION in volume, no way can it match that again. Also this wasn't just retail. Some big GOP hedges took major advantage of this and will do the same on the way down. 

Also there are tons of 'political' people who don't own a single individual stock, that doesn't really mean anything.
He's probably looking for a mansion.

&gt;Just a bunch of terrorists spreading lies and plotting evil...

SNAP CEO said the N word?
Just like that politics is able to fuse with WSB.
I hadn't even heard of this one yet. Mooning all day and no one saying anything. Jerks.
Not going to happen. It’s a nothing burger and always had been.
The only thing they're crushing is the basement floor mate.
I’m gonna get myself a very nice expensive spray tan
Does anyone even use snapchat anymore? Am.o becoming a boomer?
My calls are being annihilated
🥭 now the same price as SNAP
Kinda feels like the next NikoIa

No, send it to 20.

Hi this is Hunter.. those pics weren’t mine.. I was hacked 😎
We’re here boo
Basically SNAP is Geno Smith
Picked up some SNAP calls at the end of today, I have a good feeling they're going to crush earnings 😏
Exactly. The "social media" service is probably going to be like his last one, a blog, or like the other 3 that tried to start up for this same purpose... in 6 months, the bag holders are going to wonder how they got scammed.
Oh yeah, I know what I’m buying when the market opens.

A pump this retarded is gonna have some legs for a couple days.
Wish I got in at open this morning or my investment would’ve 5xed already, but I was asleep at the wheel aka actually working.
I have calls too bro and I’m pretty sure we’re fucked for tomorrow
doesnt look like anything is ripping tomorrow except WSB assholes
Nah Costco doesn’t give a shit about social media ad revenues.
Dude is whack thinking M is worth $42
Google Trump stock. Banned ticker
Holy fuckin shit bro it's still going 25% up after hours.
Stop, INTC is already dead
Expecting SPY's drilling to start around 10 or 11am if Evergrande defaults on any of its US-denominated bonds due to be paid by noon ET tomorrow that haven't been paid since 9/23.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't see why any of the creditors would work with Evergrande right now knowing that default is imminent.
can't stump the SPAC
I think I’m in the right place
#BB to 12…tomorrow
Why u be ghay you ber
Any of you guys want a hug?
So what happens iOS and Android simply ban mango's social media app?
Today huge volume
If the 🥭 passes Fb that would be something
Imagine being invested in a restaurant stock with a PE of 90.
What are your childhood memories that keep you up before falling asleep due to the embarrassment?
It’s not over. Just talked to one of the biggest trumpers I know and he had no idea what it was.
No offense but this dip is not going to be 1 or 2 days.. tappering will start, stores will not have products, delivery and supply chains will grind to  a hault for Christmas. I know u mean well but yeah.
Snap just fumbled the entire market in the 4th quarter
Please unban u/gambled4myrangerover. He got banned for the exact same ban bet.
Gme?
googl down near 3% on this snap miss is probably a gift i should take advantage of
Explosion
Why is pypl down
Whelp, I'm back to where I was at the end of August before going into September with 1/3 of money in SPY calls.

What should I waste it on this time?
RIP in peace.

Tesla puts? Chinese citizens cant buy new cars when they aren't making money on real estate. Europe cant buy new cars if they spend all their money on energy costs. US just has their own problems, feel tesla workers will unionize soon, same as Amazon and John deere.
Doesn't even rhyme ya turd
F U mango man, why didn't anyone say anything about this before. Cummon guys. I'll get in at open tomorrow.

SNAP pulled a TWTR
Ask hunter.
6 leaps are up, bought a few months ago blacked out
Trump
Where’s the genius doubting the 🍊
Who said he’d make money on the way down when there aren’t options yet. Told you it would open at 55 or be there shortly after open. Hasn’t even started Boomers haven’t even watched the news yet and crazy maga are still in the woods until dark.
How much bigger did your peen get?
Perfect ticker name
he hasn't even started pumping his stock yet to his followers. Just the announcement of him running for President he was doing shitty in the polls and everyone was laughing. Then when he started rallying and pumping he won the whole fucking shit. Imagine when he starts pumping this.
Yes we will burn some of our cash for fun because we will have so much of it

Pretty sure that just means wide bid ask spreads

Wtf is mango
Donny looking to bring Alex Jones over to his news station
This market is so damn sweet I really enjoy playing in it. but rn I’m just so timid from all the volatility from the last year. Sucks to be a broke investor with big dreams lol
I can live with that bro.
I think it has 1-2 days more of pumping but 200? Wouldnt that make it more valuable than twitter?
[deleted]
Nope! Friday, smacked botty for naff tech is rocket fuel for SP straights.
The drop was for nothing lmaoooooo - that would send PYPL and PINS even deeper, cant wait to see that.... oh wait I have long SPY calls fuck nvm
Imagine when the mango actually speaks
INTC outlook is positive except that they are idiosyncraticaly dumb as shit. AMD gonna rip to $130 tomorrow
Question on Shipping SfL or G$L???
Lots of buying opportunities made after hours, Lets see if they hold till open.
I bought 🥭 at $17.67 and sold at $50.18 AMA
The trump pump don’t dump believe me
Intel calls will be an easy play for next week.
Calls on SNAP???
thanks, i will. i'm not super worried about it. Hope your day tomorrow is filled with tendies
SNAP call holder loss porn gonna be 💦 tomorrow
I put $400something into it at $43, guess I should’ve YOLOd my whole account, but what can ya do.

What is Trump?
Reports coming out that PYPL/PINS isn’t going to happen, perhaps my PINS poots have a chance after all?
Mattel is the only company reporting earnings that is still green. 

Barbies keeping the bulls alive. 👯‍♀️👁👄👁👯‍♀️
Genuine Question, I’m up 78% on URC on the TSX-V… any Uranium guys care to tell me how this is possible? 

All my uranium stonks are up to the moon since buying in mid-august ✊🏼
SNAP started the post-covid rally when it gapped up 36% after April 20th, 2020 earnings.  

No way it is the start of the end of the post-covid rally.  Right guys?  Guys?
So I guess orange IS the new black.
Mango is gonna blow bigger than GME.  Never underestimate the Donald’s ability to find a newer bigger scam than before
Jesus fuck SNAP died
It is being created to stop the lies
That hurts sorry.
Wait for pullback. It’s going to $100 in a week probably
AMD calls printing next week

Trump should do a pharma SPAC next, appoint Don Jr chief scientist

What's numbnuts ticker? Curious
Something funky with AH updates. Different apps showing different numbers.
🍃
This is like 10th time of Intel crashing to $50 at earning.  Now this is the time to buy the dip and sell it at 53 or something.
I'm going to be sick I missed everything because of work I'm not getting any trump money fuck this
money is the great equalizer
Ah is fucky, especially on thursday because of contracts and early assignment
The price per gallon of gas in Italy is 7.5... curious after taxes, how tf do people here live
Yeah they are the ultimate party poopers
That would fak you
Uh they did, did you not see what they did to their Master Trump's stock? 400%, wild.
Nothing like smoking 420 after work (that’s marijuana)
&gt; craner is a fucking idiot. he‘s been running his mouth about what we do and now the SEC has issued subpoenas to our firm
I mean, his cult pays him every time he asks, no matter what the reason.

Working out for both of us.
 That SNAP rugpull 🤣🤡🧸
Can't stop won't stop TrumpFace! Bet ya all love orange man now huh. Fuckin hypocrites
It’s a pump and dump - if you don’t think Mango isn’t going to take all his supporters money then you don’t know Donnie!
Craner is with wsb but can‘t say it: GME squeeze, „guys what are you doing? You‘ll ruin US all.“
If its the same as JackTwat then we are looking at $1.4k a share

&amp;#x200B;

in all cases, less than $100 a share wouldn't make sense
Sklz and Chpt my babes

If you shorted overnight I’m sorry for your margin call
That edit looks like doubt.
BUY THE ORANGE
that orange twitter will just be able to buy twitter instead next week and make its own rules
Children....children is the label you're looking for. 

Under 24s who haven't made a lot of money yet or seen how utterly wasteful and corrupt tax funded entities are. 

You'd get more use from lighting money on fire for heat than you do from taxes you pay
L’orange, classy…I like it. 

If they don’t rebrand the ticker as something memeable I will be sorely disappointed
It hit 900 mf
Trump is up 28% after hours lol, I should’ve put even more into it.
All you 🦍 going crazy in 🥭 will undoubtedly get burned.
Just watching it run up another 20% easily lmfao
Is it just me or is the daily way more lively today
Out of all of the things that make a bear happy imagine it being SNAP
My Grindr buddies are coming over tonight to watch the game, so excited
Yeah cults are so unprofitable, Jim Jones  was living in a shack after having people sign over their houses and money to him IIRC
cant believe i sold 800 shares at 19 dollars. god damn my life
Fine. u/zjz you heard the man, he wants a perma ban
Sam Adams getting hit now.  Whirlpool too.  Market red tomorrow
I think $10 was valued at 1.7 billion.  So..  over 10 now?
Wait till MAGA figures out how to buy stocks then It’s really gonna get erect lol
I just wish I bought more than the one
That ROKU drop was totally uncalled for. What the hell 😒😒😒 it should
Be going up like NFLX and not getting affected by a sexting app’s results 😒😒😒😒
Did anyone see that SOFI spike and drop?
Quadruple down bro!
Bought 2k worth of mango media warrants at close. So far that was a good idea.
The same folks who have too much pride to buy into a multi bagger stock because mango man bad are also the same ones who will be calling for insane taxes on anyone here who made 5-6 figure profit

Half bill in volume just going parabolic

There's only one idiosyncratic risk stonk

GME Is the next gme
PYPL rocket tomorrow 🚀
I remember seeing -40% AH when LCID confirmed their merger 💀
Watching this stock is just poetry.

It's like watching an orange phoenix born again from the ashes soar into the dark sky to once again shine a light of hope upon our wallets.
😂🤣😆
I once held them at 83, but sold a while back
Lmao
AAPL literally just swings it’s 2 trillion dollar dick at anything that makes money off them or related to them. QCOM and INTC making money off us, fuck em let’s sue QCOM for 2 years on a case with no grounds while we develop our own semi tech. Then drop Intel from all our product lines. They will never change unless the government reigns them in on antitrust shit
Probably a few weeks
holy. the mango stock is up 6x 😂😂😂 does anyone know the market cap of this
In this crazy market all participants are literally committed to buy the dip and you are telling me tomorrow they won’t buy all that tech? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Sucks to be in the U.K.
No one will sell me the Don. Spent 3 hours trying 😫
Just ban bet it you pussy
TSLA 920 tomorrow
ONON gonna take me to early retirement
No, I bought calls at $790 and sold today.  It’s simply unbelievably stupid to claim something will do anything, regardless of direction, based on a &lt;1% movement AH
Bullish on Mango means bullish on 🇺🇸 

SPY $460+
bet on SNDL this is still a casino or not?
There is no way DwAk can ever be a profitable company, let alone exist.  Just a bunch of terrorists spreading lies and plotting evil...  This never ending stock pump is so weird.  Can't believe it went over $50 smh
SOFI baby I never doubted you 🥰

Edit: f uuuuuuu
What is name of orange stock
 WTF ZUCC
Should we move WSB from Reddit to TMTG?

Give 🥭 his TWTR back, let the shitposting continue.
That’s all that matters
 🍊 really should be considered this subs next gme project, it's just getting started. There aren't even options yet and half of America loves the guy.

I hate him but i wanna profit off his loser ass
Imagine buying SNAP puts before close goddamn
Put all my free cash into the mango stock because I figured it would pump overnight. Did not expect mega pump.
Viagra bruh
Same man. Ran out of BP. Missed the boat on this one
If Google was about to post poor earnings like snap because of Apples privacy initiatives,  then they wouldn’t have slashed their app store fees in half today. Google following Snap’s dip doesn’t really make sense to me but as a bag holder I’m definitely biased
Current price is bonkers, congrats
MODS!!!
FB is going to be renamed The Matrix

Boomers will plug in and pretend to attack the capital, dodging tear gas canisters in slomo like Neo

Then as it’s getting good, Zuc will show up on the screen and say “swipe your CC to continue”
🥭: Can sleepy Joe do that? I did’t think so. SPY 500 eod.
What happened to goog? sympathy to snap?
Fuck Tim Apple, all my homies hate Tim Apple. -SNAP shareholders
I'm sure sell orders will be in but any dips will be bought up quickly.
let's get it up to 69 tonight
🍊 opens at $100, EOD 200… you heard it here first.. perma ban me if it doesn’t happen.
They want to harvest your data themselves. 🥴👍
I swear this is not a troll. Ive never had any issue since the last 5 years. I'm taking screenshot lolll
You also said snap ER is when it pumps. Hence implying that you bought calls. Now you saying you bought puts….this man can’t be trusted!
you and me both buddy
Magabook is gonna have me wearing a red hat
What fomo? It's going to the fucking moon
No way Snap opens 25% down tomorrow, pre market is bs

That’s just pathetic. They suck.
When?
WSB mascot looks a little more *orange* this evening 🥭
And watch AAPL, defenders of online privacy.
Imagine buying a social media company that will be filled with American hate.

Facebook and Snap started as teen platforms and weren’t filled with polarized junk. People went on them to ogle at cute chicks and make social comparisons.

Costa Rican kids or Canadian people aren’t going to log into a board filled with hateful garbage and flag waving for some other country’s ex-President.
Tommorw shall be bloody say bears everytime after market close.

This is complete insanity. I’m so curious as to how this is going to go tomorrow. This thing is never seeing a top soon. 🥭🥭
**I can’t wait for 🥭 options to go live🤤 Donald pump**
Why did SOFI just jump? I need a new pair of pants
We all know everyone buying this AH dip

GM CEO - She claims that she'll double GMs revenues by 2030.
Whats TSLA looking like on your magic 8 ball trading platform. Dont tell anyone here, just tell me...
Yea she did take an L on that. Position is exited tho
Bought 2 Jan 2022. Should see a bit of a bounce like ULTA.
Apple’s “ask app not to track you” thing came out in May. If that was really to blame for snaps earnings then it would have materialized earlier
&gt;Evergrande said on Wednesday it had scrapped a deal to sell a 50.1 percent stake in Evergrande Property Services Group to Hopson Development Holdings, a Hong Kong firm, because the smaller rival had not met the “prerequisite to make a general offer”.

snagged some l'orange in AH leggo
I have 15 snap puts and $4,000 in intel puts. Also I’m not a bear unless I’m in a bear market. I’m just not a dumb permabull who really thinks stocks only go up because they’ve only been in the market for the easiest period in market history. 16 year old kids are making money in the market yet y’all thought y’all where actually good investors because y’all did to.
Love them, a lot of them speak French too which is sexy
We need options for this mf
Cowards took profit then the boomers found out about it. Much better than the freedom phone, this is a unique opportunity for them to send a message with their money. Boomers have been silenced and stifled their whole lives. Now they can vote with their pocketbooks.
Rotation back into GameStop?
Terrible earnings, blaming apple for add blocking (super short version)
I agree 100%. I’ve always liked the product since the beginning. A lot of customers loved their product. Just stick to what you to best and improve the product…not the business.
They also have a rich daddy.

god damnit i bought so many tech calls at the bell oops!
100% users reached all time highs. I’m buying this dip after hours. Easy gains
And by the way, John, our analysts indicate it could go a heck of a lot higher
&gt;the company doesn't even do anything

&gt;is a sp@c
i picked the worst time to get back in FB LMAO

Digging his creativity when it comes to these scams, though
Haha, waiting for this.
You talking about Brandon?   


idk if we divide market cap by share price to get outstanding shares then JackTwat has 800M outstanding shares no?   


I think PedoJoe has \~37M outstanding  


if we assume that PedoJoe will be worth what JackTwat is worth then we looking at $1.4k a share right?   


so if people assume it's worth 20% of JackTwat then the value would be like $350 a share no?   


tbh I think that's the idea, people see pedoJoe has having the same market cap as TwatJack in a few years

That's not really what I'd call tanking.

And here's why that's a good thing

They lowered their guidance last ER. If you bought then that's on you

Buy some
I'm still waiting for the Pillow Guy IPO or SPAC.
lol that sham stock will go back up dont worry. You are playing in the right direction. Between hedge funds and them buying back their stock at record rates, it will eventually go to 2200. The float is super low.
It hit 900. Does it have to stay 900? And for how long?
Whoever bought snap puts fuck you
well tech stocks I'm watching either just got fucked by AAPL or went up a lot today. time to go with old faithful tomorrow, aka SOFI
QQQ Puts printing 🤑🤑🤑🤑
Well rip my snap calls…. That’s awkward

I can only get this erect man. I dont want to push it!
Yes bears identified as bears to profit from this scenario..
Say what you want about Cathie Wood, but she emptied every share of SNAP a few months ago at a $7 million gain
Yes, you are the only one seeing that
At least it’s not SNAP levels of shitting the bed, yet at least lmao
In a society built on ad revenue and selling stuff instead of manufacturing. Makes sense.
🥭 Rug pull will be the most beautiful thing in the history of the market. Thousands of fomo retards will dump as they realize the company doesn’t even do anything
Completely agree. Not with politics but where this will go. Imagine when the boomers hear and the crazy maga folks

That snap candle is fucking hilarious
Just need a 2% pre-earnings pump on BABA by next Friday, and I’ll be happy.
I’m listening to this snap call and tbh it sounds good past the apple privacy block. This seems like an overreaction just like with pton. Snap moving in on Netflix’s territory tho wtf???
I'm getting my Elantra lowered thanks to SNAP
Tomorrow is the last day of the trading week and I haven't made any money yet. How am I gonna make rent ??

Yes
Thank you Mr. President for saving my account from these thots
Lmao that's half of this sub
810p
I dumped a grand in at $18.43. 

Will probably sell tomorrow, maybe Monday seeing how things go for it tomorrow. 

Then I'll donate a few hundred of the profits to AOC.
Dee WAC
It’s still a real company and will go back up eventually. Sell OTM calls against shares and wait.

It’s not like holding bags on a company like WISH which may just go bankrupt
How high is it gonna moon, really thought it would have dumped by now?
I'm sorry but am I the only one seeing Apple 135, wmt 135, Disney 165.. IS THIS FOR REAL???
Leaps. Zuck has this thing in a headlock
Imagine identifying as a fucking animal instead of using logic and your fucking 🧠 to make money ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Tesla 910c on open.
These goddam Millennials
Once you go 🥭 you can never go back.
Apple basically told the world they *might* care about your privacy. Social media doesn't like that.
[deleted]
Oof
It had a 12 dollar gap in the charts since the last earnings that never filled. Glad to see its coming back down to reality. It will go back up though since there will be a gap in the opposite direction. When will it go up? Who knows? It could keep falling.
I like the company may grab 50 shares
my ONLY regret is that i didnt buy more and that i sold too early and literally every decision leading up to today
Google is stronger than spy 

Bye bye spy 🧸
I'm losing money on the way up and on the way down beat that!
Wait so the other guy with the same ban bet stays but this dude gets kicked?

Edit: u/marsthemartiann go to bat for this guy. You're morally obligated
Ahhh spy pushing ath while my port pushing all time lows
Wait yea it did go to 900.00 at 11:50. Can we get a modcheck lol
Well my PayPal 10/29 255c are completely dead now. PayPal fucking murdered AH. There goes the last dollar I had. Hope a fucking bus just ends me tomorrow
umm msft
Bought 1000 at $16.30 a pop still holding on hope and it’s looking promising
Anything good happen today?
Tomorrow will be exactly like the day FB missed. Futues down bigly until 8:30am, then down littly, drop $1 first 3min of trading and then pump $2 into close
You mean pay for no ads and no cookies? Yup, but that‘s not what FAANG wants, hence eg $50/month youtube
SNAP?
Of all the plays I could have chosen. The one i did choose is down 10% in two days. PYPL out here looking like a failed biotech company.
ROKU never had any business getting to where it was beyond Cathie just pumping it like all the other trash she got going at the beginning of the year
TSLA 920 tomorrow?
Brandi Love's pu$$y is open as well
Lmaoooo yall really think spy dropping tomorrow? Don't be silly now.  You know spy be off that Henny. 460 tomorrow.
You bought calls at the high of that day, didn’t you ehh
A lot of money to be made tbh. Late to the party now, but when people were in lockdown they spent money up the ass on collectibles. Cards have gone up several hundred percent in the last couple years.
Donald whack
I literally have no motivation to work. I’m fully committed to quitting my job in January and taking some time off but I’m still so stressed about all the projects at work that I’m falling behind on
Looks like new SNAP investors just became long-term bagholders
While I want VIX to pop (SPY goes down) because I have calls, I feel a heavy rotation day coming with SPY flat at ATH
Margin Call Friday 💋
Orange 🍊 for green
Fuck u SAM missed EPS second quarter in a row
I guess he s expecting tsla add revenue to go down like snaps did
kek this
I'm waiting to buy some put if it double again. Sound like one of those SPAC scam hype to me.
[deleted]
In the words of 50 cent, "get rich or die trying". I'm dead... I'm fucking DEAD
Who would have thought Snapchat would ruin the greatest bull market of all time.
Word.
CMG needs to do a 10:1 stock split and then run back up to 2k. $500B valuation for burritos incoming ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
🌈AF, but long BABA &amp; TSLA has served me well. Got SPX 1dte 4545 puts @ close. Fuk.This.Trash. 🍻
Dude, roll it up tomorrow. I used to hold and got my face eaten too many times on good contracts... now I sell and buy again at a higher strike when I've got profit. You lose a little delta doing that but depending on far up you are and how much you're rolling up, it's not gonna matter. What'll be interesting is if it can hold past $120 tomorrow.
Anyone with SNAP puts tomorrow will be enjoying their day thoroughly
I’m buying IBM and I don’t care what y’all say
I... almost didn't because of those. 

Got 2 shares as a joke and i don't want to get off now
Maybe lay off the cocaine
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Mainly because the guy is a serial fraud that has a history of bankruptcy, but to each their own. It’s basically just republican GME with how cultish it’s going to get
Blowback from SNAP earnings
How does the market cap limit work? I know it’s at 1.5B, but is that the live minute to minute market cap, or close of the previous day?
It’s holding the line above $11 which is good
Blossoming thetafag here, is it just me or are biib end of week weekly prices kind of ridiculous
What do I do tomorrow? Sell all my calls at 9.31, wait an hour and see if the dip on tech is bought.
[deleted]
This thing is gonna go through the roof. Its completely retarded
Just enjoy the seething!
[deleted]
Imagine the arrogance it must take to think the market revolves around just you instead of realizing that it obviously revolves around just me
This not an anti bull thesis however bears live for this type of shit
After hours isn’t looking too good? Down 3 tenths of a percent? Is this your first day watching a chart?  It’s flat as fuck
Already recovered $4.5k out of $14k FB value drop
SNAP at open it is
Holy fuckkkkk
Something about a chip shortage. Idk I have plenty of Lays left over from quarantine
*She wrote a note that said "have you ever had sex before"
Damn*

*And I ain't never did this before no*

*And I ain't never did this before no*
What’s the name of the service?
Damn.. SNAP $60p were only ten bucks a piece at close.
Wait until you work for a retail company with web and brick and mortar data mining.
If? Lol it’s down almost 70
Imagine not buying 🥭 because of your pride and liberal agenda
Hot
$COIN one day this stock will be your grandmother.
Roku vs. Google. Maybe Roku is about to find out how size matters.
FML
You don't buy unless RSI is below 30. Come on basic trading signal.
Orange is the new green, I guess.

Sell a put on ASTS? 🤔
Just going to keep holding my GME

lol it’s only cause i bailed out of my puts bud
Well.. BB took me on an emotional roller coaster today
Airbrush Propellant
How do I invest?
Wtf hit Intel?
ATT is the only thing AAPL have ever introduced that I genuinely commend. Fuck FB, fuck SNAP, fuck TWTR, fuck GOOG.
Likin that sexy after hours action on DWACW
Nothing
It will snap your ass
[deleted]
The juggernauts(FAANG) have spoken: Enter Drill Team Six tomorrow 🧸
I’m old
they're buying it now
Yes, causality is low on this one, but no one can deny the coincidence... Butterfly effect may be?
I’m talking about the flat line in the after hours. Just not used to it
This is how you miss the run to 480
Holy shit,  🍊 🟧 should be the Play. Not to get too political, half the country loves the guy and want a news media that isnt "woke"
Or it's oversold because its a pile of hot garbage but sure catch the bullet
Okay what did zuck do this time?
Lol you didn't buy the top moron look
Thanos SNAPped and half a year’s gains went away
Take a look at most opinions, that alone should make you comfortable. It'll be green.
"Reality can be whatever I want" -SNAP

**-23%**
I sold half at least
Cause it's only social media companies that got hitted. Both Netflix and Tesla ran up after earnings despite initial drop.
They crushed earnings despite all chip and economic headwinds. They continue to increase profit. Their production nearly doubles year over year.  They pay down debt early.  What’s not to like?
Intel what do you do my guy
We should change all US dollars from green to orange…. Every coin and bill should have trumps face on them… we should erect 50ft gold statues of his perfection in every public space nationwide. All first born sons should be required to be named Donald followed by a subsequent number.
I think I’m just retarded enough to buy 0 DTE FB calls at open
just saw SNAP

i bet they'll buy the dip on this piece of shit next week
Yea just remove murder from the law. Ppl get murdered anyways.

Smooth brain
Hedgies love it too
Just today alone was 10 bagger. Imagine buying puts on Wednesday at open
This isn’t r/investing
Bear-baiting before bull run backing.
🍆
Snap way over sold. Buying up after hours on this dip is easy money
yeah but it's 10/29 $80 calls best case scenario i can recoup some of it but i bet so wrong on this one lmao. would be loss porn material if i put more down but we'll see
it'll snap back tomorrow
Those are some big market caps getting their face ripped off.

You do the math
Tesla OG meme stock holders rewarded . Apes strong. Elon is an ape he sold all of his extra to yolo all the monies to the moon and Mars . Stick together . Amc gme Tesla . 🦍 time , Let’s fuckin go.

🎶Come as you are🎶
LOL @ intel Mama Su finna eat u alive!!!!!
Thanos snap
Jesus.. even 1 snap put would have paid 2000% tomorrow
honestly that's probably what's happening. apple  got hurt the least by this....
Bank earnings gonna make spy fucking moooon
Somebody must have covered, sheesh
#bought 0dte BB 11.5’s before close. Leggoooooo
cuz it wants to go up another 2000%!
Of course the dips will be filled, but I just want to know … is there anyone here who remembers what life was like before FB?  You know, when kids used to play outside, etc?
Sooooo SPY red tomorrow 🤔
$snap made a lot of bag holders tonight
Naked call?
lol ru for real
I already bought a shit ton of that at close.
Sdc
Lol, SPY AH. This is what happens when I hold calls overnight, 100% chance we open deep red tomorrow
When she wants snacks but has a lisp in her dialogue so she says “can I habs sum SNAPS”

Then you start snapping pics of her and she gets mad at your SNAP 👻
This is based on?
Bought spy puts 1 min before close about 4 k worth, hopefully make up for buying the top of trumps spac lmao that was 8 k
How is Corsair not at 50 yet?
AMZN 0days tomorrow.  They will make you a killing, just wait for a trend to establish, get in, and get out.  Be forewarned they’ll have you pining for Friday’s even more than you do already
Ok, I said this was a buying opportunity on FB but an admission of “our user numbers are almost certainly inaccurate” is *not* bullish.
And 10/29
Release a grunge album first
486 and sound blaster days. Manual IRQ in games.
TSLA 900 🚀🚀🚀 was the best thing all day.
I bought LUV right before they fucked up with their flights and bought PYPL instead of NFLX today lmao
how tf are futures green 😭
Yeah I can see that. I think PYPL sucks, honestly, but it will come back. Always a huge market overreaction anytime the news is slightly bad. Like SNAP, they missed earnings by literally 2.8%, and then their price drops over 25%. Even companies whose earnings far exceed expectations, stock plummets. Pretty sure the market hates any news and wants to just go its own path. Who knows. Im holding 1/20/23 SPY 675c, and Im enjoying the ride to glory
Yes
Ok well let’s say after hour isn’t looking to good what would make it reverse and gap up?
SPY $455 tmo
At the end of the day, tech stocks are the only stocks that consistently bring in revenue.

The rest are speculative plays and pump and dumps.
Facebook will recover tomorrow. Buy the dip if you see one.
But I thought it was due to Apple and not advertisers spending less in general so Roku shouldn‘t be affected at all but well its always like that
mangoes
Aight which one of you fuckers bought SNAP calls before close

PayPal just continues to drill, huh
I've had them since Monday. Might as well let them expire worthless
💥🔻So strange🧐😂🍻
What do I want for dinner, boys?
MARA
no idea, it may fall further.
I just hope it stays that low otherwise the gains will be meagre
Karen is a hotty

Holy shit SNAP got decimated
It’s the apple update fucking the entire tech sector that’s and these rates might initiate a chore here on the Qs
And everyone shorting at 8$ 🤣
🥭 my baby past $50, on its way to $69 now
SNAPPLE
TSLA is a beast
BREAKING NEWS: ONLY FILTER LEFT ON SNAP IS ORANGE TAN
You assume snap wouldn’t beat and FB would take a sympathy hit?

Also congrats and fuck you!
Tech trade is toast tomorrow

Rates are just the cherry on top 🍒

When you’re in the middle of fucking but you SNAP your back 🪦🏴‍☠️
[deleted]
Hot take… AAPL will now buy SNAP on the low and proceed to steal all your data for themselves
SNAP just blaming Apple
So how sure are we that snap stays that low? I got a straddle and put is obviously printing hard if nothing happens premarket so how much will it bounce back any ideas?
what happens if you win?
$74
Holy fuck I sold it when it was $13
Hurry up and get 100 so you can sell CCs
Up 6k this week ans hope I don’t lose it all tomorrow
I'm one of the few people that has made a killing on BB stock this year.  Some time it's just good to take your chips off the table and take a breather.  Done pretty good on O&amp;G lately too.  

I'm looking everywhere for junk to buy, but it all seems overvalued.
Facebook has taken a dump after SNAP was snapped
Same brother I literally went all in.
anyone still gonna buy FB calls? if so, why?
SNAP got Thanos snapped after ER
Full story?
Mission accomplished
Groundhog day, everyone was so sure TSLA was fucked too...
Oh wow Snapchat hit 75% of 13 year olds. So proud of them...
Snap says advertisers spending less and chopped their future revenue guidance by like 30% and people are extrapolating this to mean lower advertiser spending for digital advertisers across the board.
Snap is garbage anyways prays on kids for profit
[deleted]
I remember when SNAP was $8 what the fuck was it doing at 75 anyways
[deleted]
I got 2 65p what strike you got?
PYPL thank me later
SNAP is PAIN when PAIN died in Naruto 🗡
Mass psychosis lmfao
Not happening because Citi rhymes too much with shitty
ya luckily i had some qqq puts to offset, hopefully this brings them back to life
Ok, I will google "fuck" 

🤷‍♂️
My account got SNAPPED in the blink of an eye
Yes
Ouch so close lol
The amount of patience some of you guys lack is fucking ridiculous.


I've just been holding close to 100 shares of AAPL since July now and can almost afford a Wendy's combo. Make your money work for you, idiots.
Been having a numb face every day after I get shitfaced. No idea what that's about. Puts on my health?
What makes it seem that way retard?
hows the ITM FB call guy holding up?? this AH drop must have hurt him a lot if still holding
Damn this ban bot is super hot
Does this affect the Gmail sync and google profile sync?
I paid a buck fiddy for my stack of 24p 12/17
Fuck you Chipotle
Classic Tony hawk ramp and air pattern on SPY
# Bloody Futes. Book It.
I always buy the worst performing meme stonk of the day
SNAP single handedly crashing the market.
Oh shit son
Definitely getting some GOOGL leaps if it tanks.
Yep. My wallet has no politics. I'll ride this inevitable pump then sell as soon as I think it's run its course. 

Then I'll donate a couple of hundred to AOC for the lulz.
OCGN 💉🧬🦠
yeah I remember. this shit makes no sense.
They're gonna guide down on FY advertising revenue and possibly also user growth.  

Death sentence for a social media company.
It hit 900 today though dumb mod
Sure but come on this was fun the fact we can’t say the name of a ticker on a sub about betting on stocks, a brand new ticker mind you, is fookin ridiculous mate
You bought calls?
Threw them into amd 119c this morning! Expecting the stock to go up some more tomorrow since intel be dropping
[deleted]
Right now you can't but tomorrow maybe SPY
How did snap ever get to 83 🤣
Really tough to decide if I wanna take my winnings and run on this one or ride it out. I’m up 60% on the call I got about a month back.
Snap back to reality;

ope there goes gravity.
Why the flying poonani is mentioning the biggest 'bet' of the last 6 months banned??
Should hopefully be in the money on my snap 60 puts expiring tomorrow. My calls are clapped for sure
I dont know if anything could save this ngl
God said "Not again..."
TSLA did OK today.  It crushed ER, and was unchanged at the open... then went up 40 points.
The answer to everything right now is SNAP lol
Oh yeah... SPACS will be GREAT AGAIN.
To the people that bitch about big tech and the privacy they infringe upon or data they store and collect...you literally have no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes.

You bundle all your hatred towards Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc. but every goddam app or website you're visiting is tracking you in SOME aspect because I know you fuckers don't think twice about hitting accept when it comes to those cookie modals.

My company uses a service that can capture like 200 different fields of data depending on what you do throughout your time spent on our suite of websites.

TL;DR: Welcome to 2021; buy the tech dip retards.
Go broku
where have u been all september
Should have bought poots.
PYPL is the buy sell snap bs
It happened to me .
Nothing I said was political
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Probably a reaction to that, shouldnt really affect them much. I think yields will just hurt tech tomorrow regardless
[deleted]
AMD calls about an hour and a half ago
Hope that CMG recovers from it's amazing ER ...  it was up 40 points, and now it's down 40 points.

I hate low volume stocks.
[deleted]
As a European, I kind of hope Mango Unchained has a +120% day tomorrow.
It’s already recovering..Now from$22 to $17 loss
There were a LOT of pump n dumps going on and the hundreds of SPACs didn’t help that. It sucks but I don’t doubt that the 🥭 ticker will be above the threshold by tomorrow open so problem solved.
🌈
SNAP better say some compelling money making shit on this call
[fuck your puts](https://i.redd.it/ql6thdiapgv51.jpg)
Gapping down it seems*
RIOT bbgirl please come back
Spy 0dte calls FUUUUUUUUKD 🤣
And everyone's stop loss got triggered
TSLA gapping up tomorrow?
AMD been relentless
When my ban bet comes I need you all to know I did it for glory and god
they'll just make us pay AND still spy on us anyway
At the local top
I love you Sara!
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away.

Now it looks as though  🌈🐻s are here to stay
me. bought a put.
CRAMER is the type of person....
WED NIGHT: Buy SNAP everyone is using it everyone loves it and stock is gonna make a run after earnings
THURS NIGHT: I told you to sell SNAP no one is using it and the business model is dying and earnings will not look good---bail now!!!
CAP
Anyone knows what happened to Roku AH?
Who got Thanos SNAPped?

Don’t cluck the Duck 🦆
This looks like a repeat of previous Tech earning calls. All the stocks rally all the way till earnings and dump hard on the earnings day.
What options would you throw 1k into rn?
Im def getting puts asap.

Using an existing Open Source platform, programming in Drupal, and most likely wont fix any security flaws and they will have a ton of them, etc.

Plus where are they gonna host it? China? Russia?
C group PE is under 7 now, stop the count! End the Citi prejudice! End the hate! Stock should be at 100 minimum to be in line with the other big banks! End racism!
I like this sort of confirmation bias.
Snap casually beating average daily volume in AH
Yes, eip
This is also what Facebook pointed out earlier which caused their stock to start dropping even before the 60 minutes exposè
Ok what happened to google fuck
It's not a knife you fucker
That’s enough for me let’s buy
Thought I got slick buying leaps only to throw on my mask 🤡
23%
A lot of neck going to make snap sound tonight
Faxxx
This would be a perfect double top on all assets you did it again batman
Rip my FB calls

F
Shoulda gone with Google!
So you are saying it will recover enough for puts not to print.
This dumbass bear is already celebrating. How’s your week been buddy? SPY still up 2.2% for the week
Good
1.705
Why I like the idea, how do people think they get so many cool products for free? Are people ready to pay for Social media?
Sit in cash and wait for a correction
Gonna watch BODY go either up or down.
17,19,26 of December.
End of the world in his mind. Bout to sign up for squid game.
When in doubt blame Apple, inflation and/or labor shortages.
Fidelity may be a bunch of old ass cunts, but they don't allowing shorting if they don't have shares, so you're never forced to close.
Not everything is a conspiracy.
He hates facebook cause they held off launching under 13 Instagram
And they actually gained users, the dip is a HUGE overreaction
So what the hell is going on with Tesla?
Guys buy the DIP .. i am sure it’s the institutional AI who dumped the stocks following algorithms
"SNAP down 25% on news that Mango is coming out with his own social media platform. Stay tuned."
🧢 user growth is up 23%
so many SNAP bagholders are gonna be listening to the Earnings calls
Date on those?
[deleted]
$OCGN 💉
I only use it to send dick pics to my mum but even that’s dying off.
Which fuckers were in snap    ?
Bonds are popping off. Boomers salivating
Shoulda bought one instead 😢
my yolo SNAP call order did not fill. this makes up for the losses I had in september
Ban or bet it
Yes sorta
&gt; yeah
&gt;Adjusted earnings per share: 17 cents vs. 8 cents by Refinitiv

&gt;Revenue: $1.07 billion vs. $1.10 billion forecast by Refinitiv

&gt;Global daily active users (DAUs): 306 million vs. 301.8 million per StreetAccount

&gt;Average revenue per user (ARPU): $3.49 vs. $3.67 per StreetAccount


Not terrible.
No
Ban
More than half the sub. Reason? Because it mooned last earnings
Tried to catch the falling knife on PayPal
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Gambled4MyRangeRover (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 900.0 when it was 870.11 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Just wait till they report earnings too
[deleted]
Why did amazon flash tank after bell??
Related to snap or what?
I managed that one already. Our common friend will take care of him.
jays 401k is literally 100% in SPY lol

also the only thing they banned was buying individual tickers and active trading, they can buy ETFs like SPY and hold them without issue
Gonna snap up some SQQQ while we're at it.....
Slow clap
SPY dip fake and stupid - this is just a normal AH overreaction, tomorrow SNAP will recover to like -8%, SPY will probably finish between 452-454, may even see some green tomorrow. SPY 452-454 calls are totally fucked, so good luck if you had those, but anyone with long calls, no worries, carry on
I thought they dont want to work
NIO 50 EOM
will be crying in the corner cauz i didn't bought those TESLA 900 calls when it was 850......

T\_T
They're 0DTE, a drop to 45 would be better
That wouldn’t surprise me the slightest
Praying for ya bud lmk how it goes I’m curious
Then buy nvda or AMD
Based on my 2 scroll ups with my thumb I take it that snap is down?
SNAP blamed it on AAPL terms of service changes.  Any company that depends on ad revenue is down hard rn
You’ll see
People talking about evergrande crashing spy for weeks but it’s going to be apple lol
Heathen
DWACW to the fuckin MOON TOMORROW
[deleted]
Okay that actually makes some sense, didn’t even realize that was going on. Thanks brother
Fucking excited to start getting it on the cheap...
Did it drop to -0.3%???
You’re about to have some pissed off incels yelling in your comments soon. Gullible reactionaries don’t do good with things like facts and reality.
Naw don't buy into that narrative, that's how bagholders are created in a bubble. 

TSLA is an outlier, and the fact that we're finally starting to take climate change seriously is a big part in its current overvaluation. But SNAP is a social media company, making its overvaluation even more irrational
Nothing says trust like cashing out and switching to mutual funds. If Jay wants people to trust the Fed they should be going all in on all the speculative bubbles they created…
😅👨‍🍳🤌🏼
Listen up pussy were not here to debate politics were here to make money. I don’t give a shit if orangeman bad I want orangeman to make me green
Holy shit Snap down 25%
More $DWAC
AAPL just being a gigachad. Up AH while the rest of tech gets violated
Can’t wait for the snap loss porn tomorrow
Buying another 100k mgc pharmaceutical shares wait for moon take off. Cimetra cures long covid the trials have showed clearly. 25 Mill order already.  Sweet sale aswell
My puts needed this thank you 🍊
How many lives did Apple just destroy today?
R.Kelly likes SNAP because he thinks its a dating app for HS chicks
So many SNAP bagholders now saying ohhhh it’s coming back up only down 23% now 😂
Just yolo the snap dip. Big overreaction on earnings.
IV was not super high so you should be good
Ded
PayPal to acquire snap
Whatchu mean fool it says starts at 5 ET?
SAM, not SNAP
lol GUILTY, but but chip shortage!
Won’t get my new phone I ordered today until mid December, aapl wat the fahk
They need Apple to get this to ATH before we get to 0
so how was snap earnings?
We literally had -1.3% dips after hours just last month
Lol have fun with those puts.
Not again...
Already did
US Government buying those dips
[deleted]
Dayum 10 year about to cross 1.7
Snap said apple new privacy settings fucked with advertiser’s efficiency so advertiser’s started spending less which most assume will be across the board for advertising related tech.
You should get off the internet for awhile
Prayers man, baller move
Me too. I was feeling bad for missing the bounce.
Sir you’re late they shit the bed
who got SNAP calls lmfao
I've been checking out $EAR. Seems to be in an interesting situation. Was $70 earlier in the year and had a +30% run today back to $10. I don't think it's worth $70, but I could easily see it doubling in price. Anyone think this is a particularly retarded play? Seems like a relatively straight forward oversold and recovering to FMV move.
Funny how that old sack of shit hated him but is buying his stock lmao
https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500

Check this out, a lot of big hitters are down multiple points

Also, no, SNAP is not in SPY but that’s irrelevant to the point I was trying to make. Ad revenue is down, and the cause for that may impact a number of big companies in SPY.
I’m in it but have a hard time believing that it’d actually tank every other stock that hard while it has such a small market cap in comparison
CNBC guy talking up snap looks so defeated
[deleted]
It will big time, but 5x 10/22 75.50P have to earn more than 5.7k, my cost basis for the 15x call leg I bought.

doin fuzzy math... with IV crush it'll be close
Just getting dragged down because SNAP is down 25%.
How many more signs and hints do people need to know the top was in? The fed was trying to make this easy on you yet you chose to be greedy. Instead of blaming bears, Biden, Cramer, Burry etc: look in the mirror. I mean wipe the tears off your face first but then look in the mirror.
Where's the guys with a Fuck load of snap put! I'm excited for him 😂
Banking on a fucking juicy SAM earnings report in 5 minutes 💦💦💦
JACK MA
Yeah I sent a message to our common friend. They live together and he is gonna keep an eye on him. Not that he will kill himsef but at least he will
help him get thru tonight.
# SNAP Call Holders wellness check
[deleted]
Look at how Snap moved the entire market. Rip snap holders
Ho Lee Fuk. Over 24k on 1 DTE OTM puts. You sir are an absolutely masterful retard. This deserves its own thread.
it rhymes with Fahrenheit
Made 230% gains on bb.   Sold the gains.  Bought more calls further out with all the gains.   All or nothing
SNAP needs to buy OnlyFans....only way to make consistent money
It was nice that we got to set one last ATH today for old times sake.
AAPL mooning now?? WTH is happening
so everyone and their mothers gonna buy the SNAP dip tomorrow?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Sauce?
Also, Epstein didn't kill himself.
Not up 50% anymore 😂
Pickup
r.i.p. 10/22 snap calls
Why is FB getting crushed on Snap news?
It will, they're gonna shake the tree before the AZ facilities fire-up....
We buying the snap dip or what?
Apple messed up the ads industry. Look at SNAP
I should've bought the straddle on snap but no I had to be bullish
After 365 days, I am up 26%. I was up 140% in February.
BB all day every day
Snap just died
Bc 🟧 always wins
When you get pulled in a meeting and forget to sell those calls that expire tomorrow up 50% .
Not as bad as CHWY
Market is sus rn
 maybe they want to compete? They did try with iTunes that one time.
Nasdaq is getting hit tomorrow
Trump already put all social media out of business in just a day!
The fuck your think GOOGs been doing behind the scenes? 🥴
To peg the 🌈🐻
Cheers bro
Why is GOOG down after hours? Can't find news on it.
Dude probably needs a friend right now. Why don't you buy a six pack and knock on his door.
[deleted]
It's not just SNAP. It's every social media anything.

*I have never owned SNAP btw*
Bro I can barely see your feet…. You ok?
Major guh, shits down 25% AH
Oh SNAP!
My calls do too+
i wouldn't be on apple rn. THey're having biiiig trouble with supply chains.
They’ll then realise that they actually do have to moderate content but will suck at doing it, just like everyone else. 
The second I can, I’m gonna short the crap out of truth social
Apple’s new privacy setting made it harder for advertisers to be efficient so advertisers spent less. Pointing to digital advertising slowdown across the board which is a lot of these tech company’s bread and butter.
Lmfao yeah, but of course I bought because rabid maga boys gonna pump this shit tomorrow.
How many just got SNAPped into the poor house?
Lot of grown men at my work trading heavy with Pokemon cards.
Hey guys. Why do I be so dumb sometimes? I have the tools to be somewhat smart? Why I be dumb tho
Fell 0.19%...
I've never been more excited to short something in my life. LOL

Never knew an app used by thots would make the market tank
SNAP earnings + 10y at 1.7% = no bueno for my tech calls

NEVER FORGET.
IBM, INTC, SNAP have all sucked
Nah that put is gonna print
If you're buying the SNAP dip I hope you make bank but I'll be happy to sneak out at even or minimally down, people's true colors are coming out about snap, not just here, but everyone says that the kids don't use it anymore and adults don't care and it's useless to them.
Lmao at WSB we always 💎🙌
BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi reports sizeable stake in orange man media.
Not true at all
Lolol snap

Was worried my 75 straddle would eat dirt but it’s spiegel eating dirt instead
I guess the positive thing is that this Apple privacy issue will be priced in by the time the other social media companies have earnings
R u ok?
US10Y 1.7%. Nothing to see here, guys ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Democrats aren’t passing sht too
My guess is there’s worries about digital advertising. Thus why snap reporting tanked Facebook, google and the trade desk, among others.
I hope so, I put $9.4k in.  Mad I bought at 39 and not 29, jumped as I was selling other assets
You ok?
Snapchat drops 30%? I am in.
Oh my god spy is forming a volcano
so glad i bought a cheap call instead of selling a put which is what i was thinking of doing because it would be "safer" lol
Facebook long term IRA!
While I expect FB to regain a significant amount by open tommorow, Im hoping it doesnt because I decided to yolo FB puts for tommorow right before close.

Rekt
I realized that today after SNAP
How much you down on snap AH?
I bought all I could when it was sub 55 - trying to average down.  I don't know if it will be green by open, but it's seeing more action now than it did all day.
Should I buy snap calls? Which should I buy?
Is cramer fucking with us? He claims tesla is worth 1k but he also hates wsb and knows we watch him. 

Inversing him maybe the play. He wanted to destroy wsb
I actually hate the idea of targeted ads. Thanks apple
1.699
IBM heard a WSBer oggle that SNAP was worth more earlier today &amp; is now giggling a lil +0.3% AH
Ridiculous
Warning for all Ad companies for sure
Pretty big overreaction imo, but also fuck snap. The shit that goes public is ridiculous nowadays. 

Anyways my 453c spy is fucked tomorrow isn't it?
Apple privacy policy affecting SNAPs numbers. 

Google ad revenue from users on iPhone is probably assumed to be affected as well.
PLOT TWIST = GOOG gonna crush ad revenues again!

Bunch of that $400m snap missed in ad sales went to Google 😆
Dang what's going on with GOOGL?
Dudes making teddy bear pics out of their face deserve to lose money.

Full stop.
Motherfucker this ain’t a dip its a crater
So all the bulls are mega rich this week huh?
SPY just fucking tanked!!!!
Why the hell can’t we say the ticker? Wtf happened to this sub Jesus Christ
In the pool on my floaty and smoking a cigar. Can’t talk 

https://imgur.com/a/yKi7tJQ
I don’t know if -23% is creeping back up
I've been an Android user all my life but Apple's stance is fucking awesome. Seriously considering an iPhone next. Fuck SNAP, TWTR, FB and all this garbage
[deleted]
🤡
Can't wait to see the 12/17 70P I bought for $4.15 🤤
Bruh I can tell you its intrinsic value but who knows what IV will look like in the morning.
10 $75 puts
Lmao company created overnight. Plans to merge with a chinese special purpose acquisition company. Claims to have an upcoming beta when when use open source social media platform Mastadon and just remove the branding from it. Already having problems and it's really obvious this thing is going to have massive security flaws.


Claims to be a free speech platform but go talk shit about their site or insult their cult leader and I guarantee you'll be banned immediately. In fact free seech to them means they want to post racist stuff, cp, plot terrorist acts, spread insane conspiracy theories, etc.


Claimed their platform already got hacked. By hacked they mean someone found the site and signed up through the normal process and were able to grab the names "mike pence" or "donald trump" or "donald j trump" and thrn proceeded to post pictures of wild animals shitting
Should I buy calls?
I feel like people are being pretty reactionary, I feel like SNAP’s sell off is making a mountain out of a molehill. They had marginal losses to ad revenue and guidance, but I don’t think that justifies a 22% dip
Thanks you fucken Dongus
I sold a $75P on SNAP 😵‍💫
Agree. Going to be much harder for you IMO.
INTC big oof
Gonna go with no?
This thing rockets 357% in 1 day and people talk about snap and intc
Exactly, the drop was a gigantic overreaction
SNAPped out of existence
God damn I look good
Snap said the N word
Already recovered $2000, $12k to go before extended hours closing

PS: recovered $3.8k
94%
Some people are better off trading baseball cards. Stocks just bring them to financial ruin
Yes snap longs .
thinking of selling my COIN calls and buying up Etsy calls
INTL is a miniscule part of SPY.  Is SNAP even in SPY?

Meanwhile, plenty of other tech is up.  AMD, NVDA

I don't get the AH dip
Why is tech dumping? DUDE TQQQ NOOOOOO
Snap blaming revenue loss on labor shortages lmao everybody is quitting their jobs they dont give a fuck anymore. Work sucks.
Market right now is brutal on even small missed earnings.
One could expect no less coming from a 🍊 Genius.
PYPL. Got a nice haircut below the ema. If that ain’t a dip I don’t know what is.
pray for a rebound into 65
Why is that? $FSLY can go up to 100$ by EOY.
Cliff diving anyone?
Nope. Fuck SNAP. That shit belongs to the dumpster
Not sure holding trump bucks overnight is the smartest move but oh well! Doin it anyway
No matter your feelings on the company, this dip on SNAP is the deal of the month. Buy it.
This made my dick hard
It’s already starting to go back up
Don’t forget the cheese fries
tbh one of the funniest memes of the last year
The bigger money was in fb and goog puts
After hours priced in.
U should check to see if he’s okay
I popped in here to see if I could glean why Google just dipped and it looks like as best as I can tell Snapchat now controls the fate of the entire market and Tim Apple is our only hope? I'm not sure if I'm reading this all right.
Big tech calls shopping tomorrow
Futures will be green and we will decide they matter tonight.
Earnings, motherfucker.
I can just imagine hundreds of thousands of put holders of Snap slowly losing their erections right now. Hundreds of pounds of blood moving from penises to bodies as Snap slowly creeps back up from after hour buyers who know what over sold means.
Amd hit before my own dd, I should be banned for a week for doubting
You bought SNAP shares?
snap is the canary in the mine
I know a lot of us love AAPL, and a lot of us have AAPL, and a lot of us respect what AAPL is doing for consumers. But this has gone too far and we have to take it out back and shoot it. 🍎 🔫
CLF going to beat earnings tomorrow or what?
ya this looking fishier and fishier.
gap filled on SNDL looking to add more. Chart starting to look bullish!
SNAP shits the bed showing big cracks in overvalued growth stocks which has knock on effects throughout tech. Bond yields rise above 1.7% overnight approaching pre-pandemic highs. Evergrande formal default on Saturday is the final nail in the coffin.

Grats
EARNINGS SEASON IS THE BEST SEASON
Praying for that dude who had leaps that were up 1000%. I mean he’s fine but still, rough day.
You can't say the ticker but you can say the word SPAC.
This guy definitely looks boring enough to be the Dow ceo.
Everyday we steer further away from God, and it's because I am captain of this ship.
SNAP is free money right now. Too bad I can't buy calls after hours
Well that makes no sense because my comments auto delete every 24 hours.  Maybe that's why you cant find shit.
That wasn’t a dip...
Who else is shorting UPS next week?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Do you all ever feel like an absolute G when you buy a call and next day you nearly double your money?  


$YETI
Did Nasdaq just drop 60% while I took a shower?
Same, kills meh. Still, might buy the dip tomorrow. Ain't nothing changed about the company
Giardiniera is in, social media is out
big lol. "almost certainly"

more like PreciousHoldinBagsins
$FB over here
Bye
After Hours is a blood bath today. All my gains wiped.
🥭's SPAC is the most successful SPAC in history. He can say that and it will be the absolute truth.
and then a minimal dump goes
I can't wait to short that new social media company I've been reading about.
What a great buying opportunity for SNAP, I just sold everything that wasn’t bolted to the floor to buy more of it
[Should've listened to /u/1r0nyman](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppmyal/now_you_know/hd5pi21/)
I'm grabbing up facebook in lieu of averaging down on snap. Might actually sell that one as a loss for once.
My co-worker stopped playing stocks 3 weeks ago because he lost so much. He admitted that he has gambling problem.

Today he sent me a chat at 4pm saying he bought SNAP calls....

Holy shit. I don't know if I should feel bad for him since I told him many times to stay away from stocks.
Ok I ll take that
OOOOOOOOO this after hours JUICY.  also your daily reminder that AH doesn't matter at all unless you have volume, of which most of the sell offs don't.
Only the skins sir
*Fed members sell stocks at ATH*

“Hey that’s messed up!”

*Jay waits until ATH again to say no more owning stocks*

Jay: “Okay now we have sell” 🤡
Did ya buy the snap dip son?
Completely forgot snap earnings was today fml almost bought puts on them yesterday shiiiittt
Another night of red followed by a day of green. Fuck me for being a 🌈🐻.
RIP
lol shoulda straddled SNAP more evenly. Holding a 1:1 straddle on SAM, that'll print, but not sure my 3:1 call/put straddle on SNAP is gonna break even.
Please tell me next moves. Thanks
SNAP SIUUUUUUUUUUUUU
You mean how today was also supposed to be the day the music stopped?
apple changed rules-less tracking users=worse ads=less profits=gotta sell stocks with profits from ads like PINS FB SNAP SPOT
Lmfao keep dreaming

You need the inflatable one with hand pump, custom fit with every pump
I find IBM being up after hours hilarious
Not buying this dip is almost unforgivable 

Don’t cluck the Duck 🦆
The market was going to act like it wasn’t a flaming bag of shit for Halloween, but then it realized it’s scarier just being itself, a flaming bag of shit.
GOOG and FB calls
Good luck to you too.
US Economy crashing because of Snapchat earnings wasn’t on my bingo card but I’ll be 🏳️‍🌈 for a day if my $450 puts print
Automod is a bro
SNAP I KNOW IT HURTS, BUT YOU GOTTA BUY NOW, NO FEAR!
I mean it dipped AF..

Guys I have no clue how much its worth.  I honestly forgot I bought it.  I assume it will be up bigly lol.
What's going on? Why some major stocks tanking AH???
hahaha only wishing i'd bought more
p h a g g o t s
I just hope this means we get our focus shifted to Asia stocks and get sea limited to 380 tomorrow
Was looking at snap puts today. Oh well
No one cares about DOW Inc. Talk about SNAP and Intel CNBC
[deleted]
It's rebounding.  Somebody is going to put the screws to them before they have a chance to print tomorrow.
As long as dating apps and nudes exists, SNAP is going to be fine
It’s the rate at which everything is falling my man
😂 what bro
I already have a Facebook 465 banbet and options backing that up too FML
You'll be wishing you held them 457 spy calls going into tomorrow. I'll never go against the bull again 💯
It will... Watch 😎
Glad I sold my spy calls eod
Who else bought the snap dip?💰 Green by open?
Don’t forget, the Fed Presidents were “forced to sell” a couple weeks ago
&gt; I'm not retarded, I just don't care about the market.
Bought 8 @ 352 today 🤞🏻
Looks like tomorrow will be another

Why is snap dying
You can't remember the last time you saw -0.22% after hours on SPY? You must be retarded
SPY open at $500
You forgot to say banbet
thats what i meant ofc..!
Always close these positions before close....never know what's going to happen AH
#MakeSNAPGreatAgain
That's true.

But this seems overreaction a bit as it's two prong.

Tim Apple privacy factor and ad spent factor from supply chain disruption.

I think GOOGL is the easy buy here and FB still too. Easier to go boomer shares tho and/or leaps.
Lol
Rules don't matter anymore. Look at Tesla, yet this sub keeping jerking their load all over the 4680
I bought 150 10/22 456c's but I also bought 50 10/22 450p's at 3:59 lol shew! I may be saved.
😂
Scrolls through your comments looking for you telling a bull that they’re being salty and just ignore it. Funny wonder why I can’t find anything.
Well that was a nice little run while it lasted.

I simply have no choice but to buy the SNAP dip
Ban Bet
Snap
Sir this is no longer fud it will be confirmed
U can tell this guy gets his news from WSB ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Tomorrow will hurt. Futures will almost certainly hit -5% circuit breakers. Instant FUD at open into another circuit breaker 20 minutes in. Repeat
[deleted]
I remember when snap was a meme stock here and trading in the 10s and 11s consistently. Looks like it's going to be heading back there
I missed the scoop on SNAP. Fill me in.
They’re ads didn’t bring in as much money because of new Apple policies?
I was so fucking close to buying SNAP puts but then thought IV crush would kill them. Still wish I bought
I'd say 50-51.

But, it's oversold.
SNAP and INTL. Snap lost significant revenue due to limitations with ad revenue sources. Generally speaking the market seems to be taking this as a sign of weakness in tech. In my opinion it’s an over reaction.

Edit: to expand on this, the expectation is for other companies that rely on ad revenue to also see a big decline in their earning reports.
facts same!@
I'm gonna need a bigger butt plug.
Remember, the market always zigs when you zag
Apple just dashed all hopes of SPY hitting ATH tomorrow.
If you thought INTC was going to pump on earnings you might literally be retarded.
#PLEASE LET THE AMD-XILINX MERGER BE COMPLETE

Catsup or ketchup?
This is gonna be bumpy earnings season, god damn
SPY just did a "call an ambulance, but not for me" flip at the end there
sold my 10/29 qqq puts for a $600 loss, sigh...
Ope, there goes Rabbit
They unbanned me
If Facebook rebounds from -25$ before market open I’ll legit find Mark and give him the longest zucc of his life.
FB would control us all with their metaverse. Buy the dip and become a shareholder or Zuck would give you a micro penis.
I will admit, somebody SNAPed my balls and I'm in a bit of pain right now.  The pain didn't stop me from buying more SNAP while it was sub 55.
wtf just happened to spy and tech??? wtf?
Ope, there goes Rabbit
thank goodness I didn’t buy SNAP calls
lmao holy shit. SNAP had $2.5B in revenue in 2020 and *had* $120B in market cap. No shit they were due for a huge correction
0.5 trillion
What was the word?
lol down boy
FB is slowly gaining… buy the DIP if you can
Hasn't this happened before? Where snapchat shit the bed and somehow the entire Nasdaq goes down in sympathy to this fucking meme app company lmao
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/Zen0d0x** bet **SPY** goes from **452.8** to **480.0** before **2021-11-04 16:43:39.393523-04:00** **

Bet they bought puts last earnings and thought they smartened up 🤣
Lmao at everything
I bought NIO puts eod so no one can out retard me.
bought 1000 shares of SNAP at 53.  Im up 450 bucks already lol.  Crazy to think that's basically some people's weekly wage.
ad spending is highly correlated across SNAP GOOG FB
Who's eating mangos tomorrow?
!banbet SPY $480 2w 

p.s. Bears absolutely almost as retarded as visual mod.
I’m hoping for a huge bloodbath all across the board tomorrow and VIX spunking up to 20
Did a boomer move and bought some FB shares. SNAP never made money while FB prints money
Mango-Man Social will sidestep Apple app store revenue woes by getting de-listed from the app store asap. 4D CHESS

Shits gonna get violent tomorrow
Have you seen SNAP, FB, TWTR, GOOG...?
Doesn’t look like you’re banned 🤷‍♀️
What the fuck do you think SPY is? 🤔
I need HCA to have a good earnings report.
Tech is doing just fine
Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
well today it is kinda investment related, and I think you'll find the market agrees
All we need is evergrande default and the party is started
JFC you guys are still holding on to spy calls…

I was researching the cost of building a steel barn and shit is crazy expensive with a long backorder, thats my only DD. You?
Spy lost all its gains from today in 45 minutes.
Pretty sure that’s lights out guys I can’t remember the last time I saw an AH sell off like this
God damn $SNAP lmao
Maybe you should try building a social network away from Reddit and other Big Tech where you can freely talk about social networks that are away from Reddit and Big Tech.
The fact that SNAP is ruining everyone that was just playing SPY is maddening. Fuck social media.
Facebook stays catching these Ls
No shit. About ready to go cash gang.
lmao i saw a few retards buying SNAP calls EOD. come out and reveal yourself
Snap missed on earnings
AMD back to ATH.  Sooner than expected.

Should’ve bought that dip at $100…
Go fuck yourself u bitter ho, wasn't talking to your ass
$EAR
Fundamental
 remember, if vertical lines and out of nowhere gaps are inconsequential on the way up, it will be a scary ride down ​
GOOG or GOOGL?
I’m hoping intel’s current price keeps or drops further. Bought my puts on Monday for tomorrow and next week. Gonna see if I’m able to avoid iv crush or get dp’d by iv crush and theta 😂. 

Also bought some amd calls to go for that double whammy

**thanks for the reassurance boys!!
Congrats on being a full retard. How much rock did you smoke today?
They both make money through advertising... TWTR is also down
She’s definitely the dungeon in the closet type
Spy returned all gains, cant wait for my red calls tomorrow 😁
Op there goes gravity
Man that sure sucks 😒😒😒
This is also assuming that those same users won’t just stay on Twitter and Facebook while using it.

I mean Parler users probably didn’t delete their Facebooks and Twitters.
Oops their goes gravity
Rip to those in snap, goog &amp; fb
LMFAOOOOOO thanks dawg
This lol. Snap was dying 4 years ago let alone today.
Glad I paid for December calls. But holy shit my heart.

AMC is going to 37.11
They not gonna like this one chief
Hands up if you got your dick Snapped off
All these flavors and you choose salty.  Why not just ignore it and do the trades you think are good?  I've ignored the noise and this sub has put me up 1113% on the year.

#Ban Bet Won?

/u/marsthemartiann (1/0) made a bet that TSLA would go to 900.00 when it was something less than that idk and it did, to the penny, congrats autist.
I sold my 0dte qqq put and naturally all gains are wiped out the next hour
Please be right
!banbet SPY $475 2w 

P.s. bears absolutely fucking retarded.
holy shit thank God I don’t own Snapchat good fucking lord
Why? Nah they were covered
No, the big gay is
Should I gobble up cheap calls on any of this shit tomo?
Donny Pump is back to save us !
Projections on when we will make money: The future
Have you seen what it’s done in the last 7 days?
If fb were to be below 320 tomorrow. I'm going all in.
$MSFT shareholder proposal votes are expiring end of this month. Go to the link you got from from your broker and vote. Board of Directors are recommending voting Against racial equity pay reporting, against sexual harassment reporting etc.

Where were you when social media died?
Wtf happened after hours lol
Looks like my 450$ spy puts have some hope
Snap had that earnings beat 3 months ago where it jumped 40%.It's no surprise it was trading at a level way to high.  Expectations were overblown.
Snap still overvalued at 50s 

Should be teens. Like it’s user base. Fucking clown ass company
Big math guy I see. Clearly in the right spot.
Why is TQQQ dumping AH?
Spy normally after a dip like this there is a dead cat bounce at this point this is illegal
pay someone to take them off your hands
Did u say that for the last 4 ER?
Why is pypl being taken down with snap..? Do these retarded fucking boomers realize they’re not associated
😂
I was feeling frisky and splurged on the name brand lube.
▪️🟧
Snap ceo drop n bomb?
Trash automod banned me even though tesla got to exactly 900 lmao. 

Thank fuck for human mods😂
No you can’t, they only make them in orange now
Day one of trump social media and FB and Twitter are already going to $0
$ROPE for us
Do we really want a metaverse, feels like were already in one.
I lost 1600 because I paperhanded FB yolo calls, but luckily I paperhanded FB yolo calls
Hopefully my 1 amd call option can make up for my 3 Intel call options.
Social media stocks wrecked.. except for dear leader mango's social media stock! rotation into it..! needs a 0.5 trillion* market valuation
There’s hope for my $450 puts yet
Snap and Facebook are the brand new Myspace.
The silver lining about being long on intel today is that it's not snap.
I was kicking myself all day for getting rid of my 10/22 335 FB calls too early
SNAP snapped.
Drill team six also doing a number on ROKU. AH
Do they ever make money?
AAPL with their new data privacy on iPhone
Not sure I understand the logic here either. Knee jerk
Glad I bought a spy put before close but I couldn’t sell my call like a dunce
I would have felt so smug selling options with the IV as high as it was and gotten totally drilled.

Don't fuck with earnings honestly
I have CSPs that I'll need to roll out tomorrow. Hopefully they explain on the call how they're going to ramp up monetization of their growing user base and SNAP will run right back up to ATH by open.
I'm still butthurt about my 2k loss last year on snap 18p - fuck that valueless company
Took a shit.
We lose way more than that daily on WSB lol

SNAP pleas snap back
Bulls I know some of y’all might feel defeated from ah &amp; earnings but just be grateful you have a whole night off before y’all get brutally curb stomped tomorrow.
What is going on with SNAP is a gigantic overreaction and when the markets open tomorrow SNAP will be higher then when it closed
Of all the times not to go full gay bear on snap
Volume and open interest on SNAP puts was huge; going to be a lot of 20-50 baggers in there... wow.

60 put had 7k open interest with 9k volume just as an example, and that's a 30x right now.
Cry
I cannot believe my calls are fucked because of SNAPCHAT
I have spoken
Anyone thinking of a YOLO on $FSLY Fastly before earnings?
lol pypl

who knew that a rumor that your company is buying Pinterest could wipe 10% off your market cap
she really did tame him, sad to see share holders though she was holding him back from tsla.


can you imagine, your break up causes a stock rally.
You're cool, don't come to the market tomorrow
Tmr will be a disaster. I wouldn't buy the dip. Apple's privacy stance won't change.
That news is like 8 years old so not much reason to mention it anymore
Flee the country before it’s too late
This has been said the last 6 trading days lol
false she is an investing tycoon, bought 🥭 dip today
Lotta Monday morning QBs in this piece, two hours ago it was SNAP TO 100
He is eating Ramen 🍜
I’m sorry for your loss. Your retardedness has healed me from my wounds today. Thank you for your service
Imagine selling SPY, MSFT or AAPL bc SNAP sucks ok 👍

Fb is not a shitty company. It's literally one of the biggest holdings in spy. Now shut up post 2020 investor. Lol
&gt;I’m a going to hard?

what in the fuck
Market has and will always be fucking retarded
of all companies, fucking SNAP is gonna blow up the tech market lmao
TrumpBook is the social media king
My snap calls expire next week, what to do…
How the hell did FB dump so hard just on news on SNAP??
I know I'm still fucked tomorrow because of the collateral damage to the market, but damn I'm glad I avoided the names drilling bigly right now. Was this close to loading up on FB calls a couple days ago.
So buy em all
Can’t get them yet, otherwise yeah
I'm surprise that it hadn't slow down the last few days with the drop in TLT. I thought high rates means those small companies can't borrow as much.
I swear I saw someone warning people here 2 weeks ago
Hate to say it but I think SPY is going to have a good size pull back next week…..
ENRON
A lot of accounts were SNAPPED today
SNAP is shit, don't buy in haha
10/29 AMD 120c keep going baby
They are going to kill the market if Snap doesnt at least recover slightly lmao
so spy all time high?

It's also just very telling that they're using futures contracts instead of the underlying directly the way that GLD does. The drag from rolling futures is still preferable to direct transaction costs.
INTC gonna be a good one to tax harvest on....

They fed the bulls well and led them to slaughter
Depends on your position. You'll make money even if the stock trade flat and more money if the stock goes in the direction you picked.
SNAP earning call: So we made negative money. Actually, less than that.
Ha ha SNAP, delicious Portillo's italian beef sandwiches are impervious to your implosion
Sounds gay
Im like 1000% sure the things that just hard dumped are going to blast off in PM tomorrow, and be back to average by open
Also b4 my ban your avatar is fucking disgusting.
Bad earnings
Lmao. AMZN sell off then they realize it doesn't run on ads and it bounce right back up. Foolish algos!
SPY is way oversold
Dumb ass bulls are about to get gaped so hard tomorrow and everyone else is going to kick back and enjoy y’all’s pain and suffering. I’m a going to hard? Of course not just look at their comments over the last few days and realize it couldn’t happen to a more deserving group of suckas.
guys dont worry its just top officials cashing out. no need to alarm you. keep buying that dip
Since when did fundamentals matter with SNAP? I thought the whole point was to burn through money indefinitely…
Both pins and pypl are dying togheter. Love jf
Fuck SNAP.

Fucking peice of shit.
TQQQ has gaped me once again
What does this mean for my 1000+ day Snapstreak?
Brandon better save my 0DTE calls or I’m voting Ye 2024
I'm a paper handed bitch 

See ya next week.
I don’t believe so. I am myself a businessman and place adv on Facebook. It’s still making money.
Holy fuck, orange social winning won. Fucken killed snap, Fb and Twitter
Had some 0DTE calls on $SNAP. Those are fucked, but my $AMD LEAPs should offset that loss nicely.
own google amzn fb and pypl my port is on fire
It’s only 2% FB though…
Trump is the new Zucc
Amd calls and intc puts every single time
Bought 453p right at close, gonna sell at open. Basically free money.
Hoping for another 2k tomorrow.
🤡
0.2%
I was starting to get nervous about spy puts I bought 3 days ago that expire nov 1st but I might actually make money next week???? If not back to ramen

This sentence gave me AIDS
Imagine buying 0dte Spy calls end of day 🤣
Fastly and Limelight should follow NET
Who’s bag holding SNAP be honest
used 2 day trades this week pulling $1,500 profit in TSLA calls, shouldve held and i'd be up another $1,800
That’s goals cause you have to be that big for anybody to care
I have 50k in Mango Man MAGA stock at $12 and I'm holding. Last time I thought people were fucking morons for buying GME at $60 they made almost 1,000%. This time I'm trading like a fucking idiot too.
Increased testosterone level
Or how many people don't know how effective they are at deterring ads. If the company doesn't report viewed time to the advertiser the advertisrr doesn't pay them thats how it works
WTF SNAP?!?!
Technically only losing 4k if they stay at this price when my contracts expire , I can always sell CC to hopefully get back up to what I lost
Just checked Elon’s Twitter, seems to be back to his old meme lord self, I guess grimes was the one keeping the beast chained up
Hey Alexa, play “Never going back again” !
Apple really dicking on these companies, holy shit
Should have decided on that a couple weeks ago
A shitty ass app that is meant for micro penis dick pics kinda misses earnings and causes the worlds biggest market to explode? What the actual fuck dude
this whole week was all green because bill hwang was buying
INTC needs to go under $50, so those .08 puts that I bought can print
This FUD has been going on for 3 weeks
Wouldn't be. I work in advertising and FB is shitting the bed. IOS 14 fucked them, their ads don't work anymore.
Bitch what!?
I haven't finished it
SNAP is such a overvalued stock that it deserves to die.
$155
well RTY may run as it looks we're in a high inflation high demand anyway kind of environment
Ads my guy
Can you say, oversold with me? Ready, over-sold\~
Might play calls after I watch it on open for a bit.

Well, that takes care of my idea of buying QQQ puts in the morning if the NASDAQ went up.
If they ban an individual to buy/sell stocks, create an off-shore or a family-funded company to buy/sell stocks. Do it as Hwang way
lol imagine losing a quarter of your market cap in 10 minutes
Can someone explain why debit spreads make me so horny?

SNAP earnings killing FB and kind of Alphabet
I just can’t get behind them, I feel like the CPU market gap is just going to widen. Too little too late ya know, and what then? INTC designs and fabricates all their chips in house. If that business goes under, they’re done. Just a sad story of getting complacent
😖
Right before close I had this tingling sensation that I should buy back my 6x ROKU covered calls and sell the shares for $5k profit and then initiate a new wheel tomorrow. I wish I had done that 😔😔

Always listen to the tingling boys 😞😞😞😞
Sheesh that spy drop is fuckinf viscous
Is intc going to go below 50?
AMD looking sexy asf in the AH
Lol INTC is a shit company let it drill

Snapchat software engineers with stock options be like: I want a refund and I’m done with this job
Yeah, true. But just think of the schmuck that bought at 75.95 today. You're way better than him!
Spy can you please act like you don’t give a fuck about this tech dump? Pleaseeeee. Im trynna sell those 453cs at open
SPY 🧐
God has blessed your ass

Going to make a Ban bet with 2 months remaining for 2021 for AMZN to end exactly where it started.
Only option is to slap the 401k on Broncos moneyline to make up for this after hours cucking
What's it worth now? Hopefully it'll still be down for you in the AM
How am I just now discovering that Tim Cook is gay? Did anyone else know this?
Holy fuck ! Who threw SNAP off a cliff ?
Twitch, Prime video
How much is that worth now?
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/tykc303 (0/1) made a bet that GDX would go to 35.0 when it was 32.83 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Give it a week or so and Facebook and Snap rebound all of those losses
Yeah. I'm very confident that we will be in green by end of year. People are overreacting over pins acquition. I consider it an x mas gift. 🤣
lol wait till morning
I don’t care about the platform itself. I am just thinking out loud about the price action of FB today. However, it’s 100% due to snap miss not due to “Qanonbook” or whatever that crap is gonna be called lol
Hope either you or the calls were naked 👀
People are selling the news, pick up a few calls tomorrow that expire a few weeks out and you’ll make money as people buy back in. Happens like clockwork.
How
FB and probably Alphabet are going to be red tomorrow. That's how she goes

Thanos just SNAPed his fingers
Losing market share to AMD has been the INTC earnings trend for like the past year and a half
Market got spooked but it’s easily bouncing back. Skittish cats.
i bought 880s and got out real nice too. lol we will see how the market is tomorrow. i think we should be red..
No need.  SNAP is doing fine deleting itself.
Means mooning confirmed.
Snap didn't moves bigtech. Apple's change to privacy did.
All the companies doing ads are dropping. Snap said Apple privacy policies are hurting them
[deleted]
Goog imploding 🥰🥰🥰

Bye spy
It amazes me how many people don’t have any of that. Especially tablets and kids using stuff.
I would like for INTC to stop drilling please. Thank You.
That red dildo after hours on TQQQ gave me AIDs
Tapering....
SPY dumping on that fake pump. if we open above 453 i'm getting puts
Holy FUCK Snap LMAOO

Even Goole 😂
Don’t forget evergrande could officially default on 10/23/2021 weee
They are paying $400k for shit tier new grads flexing their overvalued RSUs
Yes, you can trust them.
Grossly overvalued given how much market share they are losing to tik tok etc, just my opinion.
I sold mine at noon…before the run up haha now look at it. Lol nice move dude.
...rotations out of tech last about 3 days;  ...out of big tech maybe;  hopefully Facebook will go bankrupt.
Rip
64 bit cpus.  You aren’t as old as me.  I’m talking Pentium 75mghz days
Nicely done
Bro I need $200 for rent
The warrants went up 2000% today... absolutely insane.
I don’t expect it to be as popular as twitter or fb but it could create a significant fracture…parler was able to get millions of users within days. Don’t underestimate cults.
Bad earnings
Depends on what you see as missing out.....you made money on the way up....I am making money on the way down.

Winners winners chicken dinners
Buy the dip on INTC? Honestly, earnings didn't seem awful.
Hopped out of MSFT calls, snagged some BABA at EOD.

Time will tell whether I am a retard or a retard savant.
I gotta go to a casino just to cool down from day trading these 1dte's
Trump Tech
Right now is when INTC is free money. iykyk
Vpns ad block etc etc etc. Ad revenue isn't enough anymore
Rip
Anyone have FDs on SNAP puts?
If insider selling is the reason SNAP, FB are going down then are we gonna see shorting vs WSB folks?
Lol...buy the upcoming dip....
#Ban Bet Won
---

/u/Capasian (2/0) made a bet that INTC would go to 52.57 when it was 55.34 and it did, congrats autist.
Why is all Big tech crashing cos of SNAP?
First few minutes of AH at time of comment it looked like it was cliff diving a bit. Glad it didn't!
FBs sudden shift to the metaverse was the telltale. Kinda missed it too though.
Yeah I did the pricing. $1000 bucks into $60 puts would be 50k if the stock opens at 55 tomorrow.
Smarter people were just buying snap puts.
Spy with the fake and gay afterhours dip. Biden will save the day.
that timeline where snap fucking chat moves big tech
Leverage my SPY calls with 0DTE 357 calls , keeping the universe balanced
And snap and everything is going down is because 🟧 is taking over. It’s a $450 stock
Oof That U turn on spy. Bulls got hard baited.
sam retardants
Earnings season is going great, guys ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Lol
That conference where he had a bunch of ceos show up to pump on live tv lmao
Now the history books will no longer be able to report, "The Fed Chairmen sold their personal stocks at the absolute top in September 2021, ending the 150-year bull run of stocks in the United States of America."
Catherine Woods probably bought SNAP at the top
Pretty sure it's still news even if people don't like it 🤣
No you’re good
I’m glad people are making money but “truth” social?? Really?
Well I’m glad I got some today could still be some excitement Monday too before Tuesday’s earnings
I am straight up not having a good time. I was thinking about $65's cause of their ridiculously unrealistic gain from last ER and I hate social media but I didn't do it cause I was too focused on strangling SPY for tomrrow. FML
King 🤴
Is the 10yr yield killing tech
Well pretty happy I sold far otm calls to idiots here today
LMAO I bought a snap 63p for $25 today hoping to gain like 5% on IV with the intentions of selling at close. Forgot to sell because I was busy at work. First time I’ve been happy to be at work for a minute haha
SNAP is the canary.
Lmfao get em visual mod.
Easy after it drops , You post about before close of market 🤡
fucked harder than your wife by her bf
The beginning of the taper....
QQQ already reversed all today’s gains
just the federal reserve, not congress
What on earth has happened to SNAP after hours
went 4x on margin for SNAP at 53.8. patiently waiting for 60 to hit and then im exiting my position
I just wished that shit into existence so my puts don’t expire worthless!
Still not sure why AMZN cares. Twitch? AWS?
what were your positions?
Don’t be scared Chipotle. It’s okay to go up more than that….
INTC results look okay from a top-line perspective, but their cloud relative market share loss to AMD/Arm looks a bit steeper than expected.  And they're saying margins will be down substantially in Q4.

That explains the selloff here imo.
Or the gain porn
Two things before VisualMod bends me over like Snap did to my FB calls.

1) 🐻 r Fuk &amp; 🌈
2) is 1, but with 😂😂😂 added
Only one $73 expiring next week, rip
Lol Qqq went red
i sold my $875c i bought after open for 150%. the jumped back in mid day expecting a pump. smh
Gay ass bulls gonna buy the dip
Snapchat is dumb and the stock sucks too.
I would assume what ever is going to be discussed in the earnings call is dragging it down. Still though, losing a quarter of valuation is... excessive to say the least
Loling at snap employees who were flexing their RSUs. get fucked
We’ll played. The weekend is yours.
[deleted]
So pretty much, less advertisement for the internet companies. Bad outlook. Rotation out of tech And into value. First I thought we could expect that Q1 2022. But maybe we’re seeing it faster
I am still bullish on FB.. invested &gt; $200k .. just lost $14k value but it’s gradually getting back. The damn AI dumped SNAP and caused ripple effects.
Account will be 100% diversified with SNAP straight from his credit card.
No you’re good
The bubble may have popped 🤷‍♂️
TQQQ
Lmao u r so fucked 😂
where's that guy that recommended a straddle on SNAP, just wanna sat that I should have listened
SPY is looking like TSLA yesterday AH
News is bad.
BTW as an update on today's gap fills since I got the same comment about how I'm gonna lose money off them lol /u/Perfectly_Splendid89

TSLA 10/22 865c -&gt; I wait 5 minutes before I do a gap fill play just to let the market bottom/top out. TSLA blew through the gap in 2 minutes. If you bought those calls at open and held for maybe 30 minutes you would have turned $450 to $2k or so

SPY 10/22 452.50c -&gt; Gap filled but call value  barely budged, break even trade here

MRNA 10/22 332.50p -&gt; Gap partially filled at 10am, +$100 if you exited there

CROX 10/19 140p -&gt; Gap also partially filled (was only expecting a partial fill anyways). Put went from $400 to $500 by 10am, and $600 at 11:30am.
F
I bought 1 call and 2 puts as a hedge on SNAP. Luckily it went with the 2 puts lol
&gt; What the fuck are you talking about?
Ur a day late
Win or lose, bigly
With that after hours movement the day is looking flatter than u/cashflow_’s ass
It’s a one way ticket to the homeless village
Tesla loves to pump when everything else is red.
Rotation into TRUTH
Anyone who owns snap puts is now rich lmao
Smart people were buying FB puts ahead of SNAPs earnings. Facts!
Lol what’s with this AH selloff
The tech is the least of the concerns. But it’s gonna be a a toxic echo chamber for some very far right ppl. And I am a Trump supporter. However, I would say pretty much the same if AOC decided to launch her own woke social media platform lol.
This is the crash I was talking about 👁👄👁
AUD is worthless. It’s not an even comparison idiot
Is my SNAP 65c 10/22 fucked?
Lol FB... lol SNAP... Why Apple is not mooning then?
Fucking pissed man. Getting bear blood and tears all over my new suede kicks. Get ahold of yourself you degenerates.
Stop talking about snap.. it’s a retarded dumb company that’s never been good and has never made a penny.. if you bought it I’m sorry for your loss.
Intel dropping like the Irish during the great potato famine
Could… but not likely. Like think about the fact that FB and Twitter are both global in their user outreach.

Why would global users even want to bother with whatever will come out with Trump or otherwise?

I mean.. I rode the way up and I’m up 150%, but I have no real faith in that thing succeeding. It very existence is politically tainted, and I doubt independents will even bother.

Thinking of a big Yolo on Fastly $FSLY. 

Their Compute @ Edge seems to be growing. https://learn.fastly.com/compute-edge-promotion\_lp-en.html
some big money is trying to set the bear narrative for tomorrow. buying the dips
If you didn't think that Apple is not too powerful then you have it now
CNN: JUST IN 🥭 MEDIA BUYS $SNAP AND DELETES IT WITH NEW FOUND CAPITAL
TQQQ, you coward!
he he
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
K so they crushed EPS and barely missed revenue? Why the fuck did it fall 25%
snap guh...
Yeah a $400m miss is a lot!
We already had the dip, strength is in and it’s time for new highs. 4800 by eoy
Gay 🐻
INTC suks dik....but not as much as SNAP
Buying Snap today is giving me SPCE flashbacks. 🤡
Thanks, bruv

Who got their dick SNAP off?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
SNAP is a GYNA stock
That just means you're getting old, plenty of young people use Snapchat.
While all social media stocks are down like double digits, TRUTH is still UP 3% WTF
What’s SPY dumping on?
INTC shitting the bed for earnings is the freest money on the market
Why the fuck would you be in fb right now? That shit is definitely going down for a while.
Like a Grizzly got out of his cage at the zoo.
The upper-middle class in Australia is a lot richer than the upper-middle class in America.   How do they do that!??
Not really. AMD came up with the concept of multiple cores, and they also came up with the 64 bits CPUs. Back in the day AMD was also a gamer favourite with their 3dNow!. INTC just followed them tech-wise and had the advantage of scaling better and benefiting from a massive amount of capital + OEM contracts.
I think it's cloud share loss to AMD/Arm CPUs looks a bit steeper than expected.

And they're saying margins will be down substantially in Q4.
I've done no research at all, but I jumped in at $55.
Absolutely. It's still at the point where it has to be marketed in a very specific way.
Did they give bearish outlook?
congrats you can retire now
Further out, was too nervous, but I'm suddenly violently in the money, so I got that going for me.
Spy puts and
Didi calls at  close.

Spy  calls tomorrow and didi puts.
Ford has been my best performance pickup this month. Loving its growth
DIA looking ok though
I don't get it either. The numbers for earnings were fine but they said something about some apple hurting their ad revenue? Maybe they meant new apple policies will hurt future ad revenue? Even though their revenue for q3 was actually fine? I don't get it
True statement. It's a burrito Jody, not a fucking volleyball.
He questioned affirmative action
MY SNAP PUTS ARE PRINTING TOMORROW LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Well that SNAP trade didn’t go according to plan.  On to the next one.
What asshole is dumping their entire hedge portfolio right now lol. Nothing is having fun after hours.
Lol that new social media spac gonna get so much wsb hype
Still buying calls tomorrow. I'm addicted IDGAF
Nah, it's AAPL's fault
Gonna be shitshow
INTC and WHR are like thank goodness SNAP is taking up all the attention
Tech is hotter than a pistol!

Should we buy more qqq tomorrow comrades?
It’ll be back up before open
Would be some wild stuff if SNAP (of all things) is the canary in the coal mine
Can’t wait for the SNAP loss porn
Mostly the local slut bags use it
The 50 10/22 451P I have would love that a lot.
INTC PUT AMD CALL 

PRINTING!!!!! 🤑🤑🤑🥰🥰🥰
LOL

Intel crapped itself on earnings. Gottem.

I was ready, baby. Puts going to PRINT!
Some dude sold a bunch of SNAP 60/62 put spreads on snap today lol. Account gonna be wiped
Someone explain snap dump please. What’s the news
Seems like a trap
About fucking time policy makers are banned from the stock market sheesh
imagine thinking investing in snapchat was ever a good idea.
SNAP is like when Naruto died in Boruto
Anybody playing CLF earnings tomorrow ? And what you playin
Sing us a song you're the mango man...!
Oh snap can anyone give me the intel
Nancy is taking profits
My FB value just dropped $14000. For fucking SNAP report
This subreddit has made me a lot of money today and for that I thank you
Only girls trying to sell nudes
Lmao. I bought qqq $374 poots right at close. It’s going to be a good day.
Intel getting pounded AH.
It’s literally just marketing wank.
[deleted]
Should be 50
At least ill be able to buy back the short leg of my snap call spread tomorrow 🙃☠️
Again at that point in the day where I can’t decide if I like the $ my puts are going to pay out tomorrow more then the  panic, misery, &amp; suffering that’s happening from all the degenerate permabulls on here who’s only purpose in life is owning the bears. Yall look so goofy and pathetic when the market shits on you.
Ok earnings almost over and correction coming back on the table?
Based 🤖
Yes he did that was so retarded
Thanks SNAP, FB, twitter. Always knew they would be the downfall of society
#TRUTH SOCIAL IS IMMUNE
If you have once Chipotle in your city you shouldn't use your city as an indicator for any business

^IGSquawk ^[@IGSquawk](http://twitter.com/IGSquawk) ^at ^2021-10-21 ^16:30:41 ^EDT-0400
I had FB calls... I'm going to knock out Evan Spiegel asap
Great dip to buy
Well, guess you called it
Who would've guessed that SNAP would be the black swan! 🤡
😆🤣😂
Luck has nothing to do with blindly investing in some shitty social media company that the world has a growing hatred for.
Cannot believe you can look at snap chart and be bullish
Properly diversified gentlemen are having T Bones instead of filet mignon tonight.
This would be that crash I was talking about
$74 snap puts let goooo
INTL fucking my ass today, granted I have shares so that ass fucking is lubbed up still doesn't feel too good.
Holy shit shouldn’t have bought my AMD 115 put.

Glad I’m a shareholder at least
What happened to Snap? CEO killed somebody or what?
Ads
SNAP taking down the whole Nasdaq
Zuck’s “Metaverse” idea. 

Pretty much data and tech focusing on IoT and creating ubiquitous devices that are all connected in every facet of daily life.

FB owns a *massive* amount of subsidiary companies at this point.
And run by a bunch of boomers that know fuck all about tech
Guidance is horrible
when its a penny stock.
[deleted]
And I thought INTC was a piece of shit
FB be like awe fuck we got the same problem SNAP
Damn shit is collapsing
t'was a joke sir
INTC 😶

SNAP 😂
SNAP broke all of tech.
If you are surprised by $SNAP, just ask yourself: does anyone you know still use Snapchat?
Apple new privacy settings messed up with SNAP revenues. It will defined impact FB too.
Let's see SPY go to 451 before open tomorrow. Would make an easy buy into calls again for the run up to its ATH.
well PLTR and TSLA are barely down at least
SNAP

$0.17 EPS vs -0.0975 Expected

$1.07B vs $1.1b Expected
So AAPL privacy gonna hurt business. TWTR, PINS puts here we come
[deleted]
It be will be bought by 8pm.
Wuuut? When it jumped from 20’s to 40’s last year it was like 50% of the options activity that week. Where the fuck have you been?
Lol look what happens when you don’t share information and apple keeps it for themselves    
😂😂😂
Ditto :/
&gt; I am not sure. I don't follow stocks like that
It went down by 1 buck. It will recover tomorrow pm.
Who had snap puts?
🥭
SPwhy?
🪦
SNAP: drops on earnings

AMZN and GOOG: "It appears we are now fraudulent"
It’s positive earning still people freaking out.
I’m getting old.  I remember when Intel was unstoppable and AMD was some cheap second grade sht
Go make your own sub then if you want to talk about it. Rules are rules bud, stop being a snowflake
DIS like, “I’m a little tech, I’ll just drop a little. Ok?”
SNAP is cuckolding in the corner
why did google shit itsself
Revenue miss but probably some fundamentals getting fucked for the earnings call
i almost bought 15k worth lol glad i didn’t
😤
I can't wait to see the SNAP loss porn ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
[deleted]
SNAP earnings
I remember that Saudi pump from like $7 to $13 or some shit
Did SNAP numbers even come out?
Amd and nvidia are watching the show lol.
man i get up at 3:45 to make sure my overnights dont fuck me and sometimes i just pass out lol
I guess spy will take a bigger dump than me the morning after a hot curry 🙈

Downvote the truth I see , Feeling good about your calls 🤡🦧
tbh buy the dip on FB, GOOG, TWTR. These companies are smart enough to know how to navigate around iOS privacy issues
SNAP
Hello Robinhood customer service? I’d like a refund on my 40 snap 80c that’s I purchased today.
Someone going to post 0dte SNAP puts gain turning $500 into 5 figures
Anybody else feel like the fact that BITO exists is a bear argument for the underlying? The asset is so hard to deal with it needs to be double wrapped as an ETF full of futures contracts in order to be a viable asset for regular people.
WTF up with INTC?

Beat earnings by 54% missed revenue by less than 1% and yoy revenue down slightly. Drilling a hole to the earths core right now.
LFGGG!!!
IBM Watson is garbage 

No wonder its down 10%
Time to load up Google
Mine expires April 2022. But expecting at least a 20% drop.
My favorite part is them saying the $3.5trillion(now $1.7trillion) wil cost $0. Like bitch, we see the price tag.
i literally just bought in on some fb a few weeks ago in my roth, had to frantically buy some more which, I love you chucky schwab, but that shit is brutal to navigate rapidly
Someone missed earnings. Panic, sell everything type of move
Probably bounce back a lot in the morning
Dude loved to rally the market. 

Market is a little red and he’d tweet about how close a trade deal was or something.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Clf at 5 lol
My non tech stock that doesn’t rely on ads just dropped. Makes total sense
apple privacy hurting their ad rev
RISE SNAP. THETA GANG IS HERE.
Snap earnings got fucked on ad revenue due to Apple.  Every other company reliant on ad revenue got taken down with it
Why big tech dropping?
Snap crushed earnings tho…?
Snap earnings are terrible, other socials followed suit
1/0 retards. Of course AMD would go to 120 on INTC’s shitty earnings.
$60p were $0.11 at close. They’ll print hard.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4272)
I loaded up on snap when it hit -30%
At a glance I saw increased rev by 56% yoy, daily users increased 23% yoy, net loss improved, adjusted ebitda up 209% compared to last year.

So how do you see that in a quick summary and explain it being down 30%
SNAP killed them
Hoping FB stays around $320ish until market open tomorrow so I can grab some calls.
Or yenno you could look at the cost of the options and figure out that your comment is retarded.
What happened to INTC?
Google literally just killed every cent I made this week. Fuck stocks man.
460 you crazy!
SNAP reported that Apple's privacy changes hurt their ad business.
Lmao yeah? This is trumps doing?
Makes no sense… fb and snap shoudlnt br correlated
yeah i should’ve dumped these TSLA $900 fds
I did too; only saving grace is I pushed my calls out to 11/26. Still going to be down like 40% over this shit.
Nasdaq will shit the bed tomorrow for sure
Trump social media is no news. Imagine the worst antivax groups on FB, so it’s gonna be pretty much like that, just worse since there will probably be no moderation. 4chan for the hillbillies. 

And the snap rev miss is nothing for FB. Snap is crap, FB is everywhere - it’s the way (unfortunately) society interacts now.
PYPL, now would be a great time to rethink buying PINS after seeing what's going on with SNAP/FB/TWTR.
SNAP is falling … at what price i should buy ?
its only a 23% drop for SNAP
&gt; Intel is a master of the art of making shit that doesn't work.
Uhhhhh what?
Well that does make me feel slightly better. I'm still deep in the hole buying ROKU in the 400s like a dumb.
Apparently my "investment" in SNAP is not the one way ticket to Tendie Town I envisioned. Fuck.
INTC please keep drillin baby
Earnings were shit
Take one look at the snap story section and you know why this shits down 25%. We deserved
Baffles me. The one in our city had to shut down because it wasn’t getting enough business. 🤷
keep telling yourself that's why. It's unacceptable. Most traded stock on Fidelity today and we can't fucking discuss it
Sympathy selloff because of Snap idk
$LLKKF has been good to me.
Yo they got C00KED
What’s the deal with Intel?  Looks like a big EPS beat…
Lmfaoooooooi
Are you serious? That's not what it means. Snap died because iPhone privacy changes affect their revenue. These privacy changes are expected to similarly impact all the social media stocks (which is why they're all down)
Sell the news. You have puts now or pay high IV tomm morn
What happened with FB and GOOG?
Plans:

Buy SNAP at $30

Buy INTC at $25

Buy CLF at $5-10

Buy FB at $100
Every single social media platform will have their servers simultaneously combust leaving only the Don’s platform to rule the interwebs.
SNAP is a $25 stock at most. Good. It was trading at 15-18 pre-pandemic
Fb &amp; snap were sacrificed so 🟧 could rise
This guy voted for biden
Get this political shit outta here fool
Awww yeahhh still gonna eat tha booty tho 😜
This dip on snap is not gonna survive until tomorrow.
Fuck Tim Cuck
Panic get ready for it. Everyboomer and their mom is going to be exiting social media and tech cause they can't separate the two
FUCK YOU SNAP YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!!!!
I'd assume reaction to SNAP dying. TWTR is also tanking
SNAP you better stay down!!
Lmao agreed, they’re gonna print, a 58 strike put was like 6 cents. Tmr it’ll be closer to $2 making it a x20 gain
This snap shit makes no sense
See you in another life, brother
Tomm? It’s happening now. People will start buying.
Yeah it’s like that on purpose, it represents the cost of getting double meat on a burrito now.
10/22 puts are up 300%.
snap gonna have a wikipedia style donation pop up when you send that dick pic
FB down 6% because of SNAP earnings LMAO. SNAP finna cause the next Tech crash
Ty for the heads up!
For real, what sent every social media platform to the shadow realm AH? Did they accidentally ban themselves?
[deleted]
I, for one, was surprised to learn that SNAP is the backbone of the US economy.
Meme market
SNAP cucked all ad tech.   FB down 6% and GOOGL down 3% is ridic
The play was to buy them today because everyone knew INTC was going to take a shit on earnings.
I think it kinda got short squeezed.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

I think the AI dumped all these stocks ., 🧐
Pour one out for the homies who bought SNAP calls 🍺
Lmao who the fuck is gonna use that shitty social media? Only Ya'llQueda and the Talibangelists to spread QAnon shit and plan more terrorist attacks.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Ah
LMAOOO JUST LOADED UP ON $FB TO THE TITS!

Don’t cluck the Duck 🦆
I could have bought at 6 when WSB was unknown sub and everyone was hoping for it to go bankrupt until the Saudis bought a bunch of it
So, Tim Cook basically controls tech earnings lmao.
🥭 cucked zucc 😳
If it's not a social media platform, what is it? What are they rebranding to?
Weeklies?
#FUCK AAPL
Jesus even google down 3% . I knew that apocalypse is caused by SNAP
Maybe fb is dying. Zuck was talking about a name change a few days ago.

Bets on destroying fb and zuck joining 🍊 for a full media take over?
TrumpBook about to be a reboot of 8chan.
$fb dip looking tasty!!
how  can I buy mango
Snap should be at $25
Basically
For sure, I think the action right now probably helps looking at the tech names all stumbling hard post-market.  SNAP, INTC, GOOG, FB, TWTR, etc.

Any rotation out of big cap tech would probably be to small cap growth/value.

Key right now just looks like even if see a SPY/QQQ dip, if IWM ignores it or dips much less.
It’s moving past a key point of resistance.
🥭spac will be the only social media stock up tmrw oh how the tables have turned
These gap fills are going to be sweet

SNAP 10/22 55c or 60c

INTC 10/22 55c

Waiting for a CLF play too
&gt; Literally impossible unless you got 25-50 billion to burn like musk or bezos

I think you could accomplish it with less than that. Although my comment was more about culture than logistics.
Just buy calls dummy
[deleted]
FUCK SNAP. The only time I got calls for ER!!!
SNAP dead
What’re y’all’s predictions on AMZN tomorrow?
Cash secured , regardless say hello to the new snap bag holder lmao
Lost was such a good damn show. Too bad for the shitty final seasons and poor resolution quality.
I wouldn’t of chosen it for my rug pull bingo catalyst
Deleted my put limit sales lol LFG
It’s always dawnest before the dark
And I still can’t get a fucking burrito properly rolled
Think about all the personal data he can use for campaigning and mailers. It's a gold mine! Also maybe a little FBI honeypot.
Wait this is all because of SNAP and Apple privacy tracking ban?
Choo Choo....
Feel free
 AH wiping out all the gains from power hour
AAPL really said fuck these social media companies
Sector rotation into Tesla tomorrow 😂😂😂😂😂
They needed an excuse people would actually pay attention to is my guess
Bro a whale pumped it by 12% before close. This bitch is going ath tomorrow and over the weekend we drill that's how I see it
Nope. Welcome to a rigged market.
WTF Happend to Snap?

Earnings that bad?
Holy shit snap tanked wtf
Only if they were crazy OTM. I looked at buying a strangle atm expecting a big move either way but figured nah I don't think snap will drop below 66 on earnings. Oof
&gt; Yes, it's the only game in town.
Stocking up on lube now in preparation for all the SNAP loss porn tomorrow
[deleted]
Goog following snap does not really make sense. Both are fueled by ad revenue but one’s an essential platform for daily life and the other is snapchat.
No options trading yet, but orange man media does have warrants for sale, which are quasi-options
Shes soooooo fine
AMD 🔥🔥🔥
TIL chipotle is an 1800 dollar per share stock
SPY 600/650c 1/2024 gonna be a 15 bagger
Hey, where’s my win? I bet the same thing.
Tempted to YOLO my account on FB calls tomorrow for December.
I need this to happen to AMZN so I can buy golden toilet paper.
Same.  I saw how long it hovered around 245 and thought "Alright we go buy in" lmao
Please! I’ll gladly toss my 10/22 lottos away and cash in on the various puts I’ve been snagging all week.
Easy money
When did SNAP become THE market? People still use that piece of poop?
100 snap puts for $60 strike prices for tomorrow woulda cost $1000 at close. Right now they would be worth $50k overnight. Somebody better post their gains.
Who’s buying more AMD calls tomorrow?
It’s a new social media
Even though I just vaporized a significant amount of money I feel good that there were other unexpected victims too.
🥭 new social media is enough to kill all other social medias for now I suppose
I was sad for a second with MSFTs rocket but now I feel happy I sold the top today.

Still holding a little
bought puts on coin, hope it dies tomorrow!
Snap earnings so bad that the entire market is tanking
Now that’s a GUH

Not that -1% bs
Damn! Snap fucking snapped back… FB is definitely a buy here
#Ban Bet Won

/u/dazednconfuse (1/0) made a bet that AMD would go to 120.0 when it was 112.25 and it did, congrats you fuckin nerd.
The rule is in place because of market cap, stop playing dumb.
Social dead, I guess real life interactions now?
I got my first HUGE win with SNAP puts!!! GOD IS GREAT!!!
[deleted]
Here it's your Facebook dip. Grab it and stfu.
My puts would like that lol
Goog -3%!!!
Timmy Apple decided to cuck the entire us stock exchange?
WTF!!! SNAP was at $75 ???? Last I checked SNAP ticker was when it was in 20s
#Ban Bet Won

/u/krzen (1/0) made a bet that AMD would go to 120.0 when it was 112.21 and it did, congrats retard.
I made bank of FB calls this week and sold yesterday. I’m buying calls for like December first thing tomorrow and I can’t fucking wait
Fuck SNAP.. how it’s comparable to FB?
No way snap recovers right? GICK
Me using Snapchat to look at beautiful women 👨‍🦯🤳🏻

$SNAP: 🤌📉📉🔥🔥☄️☄️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥


Me: 🏴‍☠️🪦
RIP Snap, Google, FB
I’m allergic to ours but I should have bought some sqqq calls
No alternative can survive without big tech and the internet . Literally impossible unless you got 25-50 billion to burn like musk or bezos
There’s a sub that’s just as bad that’s on the front page of Reddit all the time
…
It will go down 50%
Zuck be like why is my net worth tied to this clown company called SNAP
people realizing apple is the big daddy of tech
I mean if it went up 20% instead that would double my entire portfolio
December? Sure maybe
#Ban Bet Won

/u/Spitzly (1/0) made a bet that AMD would go to 120.0 when it was 104.75 and it did, congrats retard.
Just because you have caps enabled doesn’t get you seen more, in fact it just makes you look more stupid, which for you is hard
ID LIKE TO THANK THE ACADEMY
Nice
uhh I'd say -30% is good enough to overcome IV
Anyone with ad revenue getting hit
SNAP LMAOOOOO
Tbh this is a pretty blatant buying opportunity on FB. 

Company is literally rebranding so that people will stop treating it like they’re just social media and it tanks in concurrence with social media lmao. 

If you’re investing in Facebook for the Facebook social media platform you’re brain damaged.

I don’t like FB for ethical reasons, so I don’t invest, but I mean come on.

(Really I just don’t want them to dominate VR because their VR is shit, but realistically they’re going to.)
Thankfully it's only my back that snapped and not any of my holdings 🤑
$RKLB📈📈📈
The red wedding and SNAP was the hot ass pregnant girl.
Puts on $455
.4%? literally tiny
FB leaps. Good thing, I was looking for a buying opportunity for my IRA
Imagine not getting rich because you don’t like mango
It's okay. It's 2021 just admit you like it.  Everybody's doing it now.
So SNAP was the catalyst that crashes the market
Snap swing trade activated
Imagine losing a quarter of your net worth in 10 minutes (SNAP executives)
I just bought up all of the SNAP I could afford - I'm sure it will rebound!
Why FB drop?
Bye bye anus, no lube
Yeah IWM would lead the way higher, and I agree everything looks set up for that. 

But then again, things tend to zig when they look like they're going to zag and the low volume pump the last week looks fake af. 

Tomorrow should be interesting, I'll be watching SPY.
No, they'll absolutely print - are you a 5 iq mongoloid?
The way Tech is looking, you'll get a dip tomorrow if these losses hold.
I've been trying to dig myself out of this hole for months got dammit I'm not losing more but I'm not gaining either. Every time I have a good play that makes me a couple of Gs I have a bad one that wipes it away, or my good play I put in a little capital and the bad one is the one I put in more. I need a winner dammit.
What does snap have to do with Facebook? I'm so lost
Lmaoo remember when snap would fuck puts every earnings? Not this time
25% damn SNAP lost more % in 5 minutes than my 🌈🐻 ass did all day.
looks like those spy 452p i bought at close will be itm by market open tomorrow
SNAP is blaming AAPL which would hit all of them.
Damn, what happened to the trade desk? Looks like Facebook and snap got hit too.
Juicy dip on FB ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
This AH is awesome...finally on the right side of the Poker Table..
LOL tomorrow will be a bloodbath for tech
Puts on trump's SPAC?
Nobody is talking about what they are gonna do tomorrow?

Puts on every social media

Calls on orange.

duh.
Wtf so now SNAP is causing a market crash bigger than evergrande .am i missing something 😳
SNAP 10/22 60P will be a 40 bagger tomorrow
There can only be one social media after today. Give rise to trumptopia
College kids in 20 years will be studying about SNAP earnings being the catalyst for the Great Depression 2.0.
Your statement proves you have no idea what you were looking at
SNAP with the Thanos snap
Same same. It is shidding itself AH
Cathie is for sure buying SNAP rn.
Algos going haywire? Intc twtr fb goog droping like rocks
SNAP, FB, TWTR plunging 27%, 7%, and 7% in after hours.
I could’ve told you that Snap was going to fail. I used to be on that shit every single day now I never use it
Lol SNAP FB. Bought some SNAP commons cause no way this lasts. Wish the market was open so I could grab some calls on both
Straight cults.
snap, guh.
INTC Put AMD call checking in 🤑🤑🤑
So we have an Anti-Social Media SPAC moon 400% and other social media stocks -7% avg. Planned af.
Fuck off SNAP, whole market is tanking on your bullshit
Naked?
hell yea I didnt let them track me.
Are we just going to ignore the massive censorship going on in this sub today? It's legitimately insane and unacceptable. Who cares about the idiot involved with it, we're hear to talk about making money
fuck sorry bro.

shit was looking good until SNAP wiped everything with a dose of reality
What competition
And SNAP puts probably didn't even print because earnings meddled with IV
Feeling horrible for only buying 15 snap puts. Oh well at least I have enough intel qqq &amp; spy puts to make up for it. Permabulls new to the market couldn’t tell the MM’s where dangling a carrot on a string all day like to trap you in their cage. Couldn’t happen to a more deserving group of gullible dipshits.
I literally bought fb calls today. Goddamnit. I have the worst fucking luck in the world.
I want to see this too.
I expect people to massively buy the dip tomorrow. Wish I had more buying power
That's the average CFD experience in a nutshell

SNAP 10/22 60P will be a 40 bagger tomorrow
I’m buying the fuck out of this Facebook dip
And thus bear season has begun

/u/king-bollie (1/0) made a bet that AMD would go to 120.0 when it was 115.99 and it did, congrats retard.
Who had SNAP puts?

👉😎👈
[deleted]
Psh only down 3.5%
F
SNAP happened
I'm guessing I may not have timed my entry into PYPL well
the zuck got cucked
Holy fuck, SNAP discount of the century. Bought a fuck ton AH.
algos
"bro it just bottomed"
Cautiously optimistic these SPY puts were a smart hedge.....it seemed overextended this week anyways. I'll buy any decent dip tomorrow if things hold, prob Jan 460 Calls
Why were so many ppl in snap wtf lmao
Earnings might tank the market before rates double fuck it.
earnings are out thats why
I just realized how juicy the dips are today. Just like netflix yesterday.
I have fb so it kinda hurts but if it stays like that tomorrow, will double down. Fb and snapchat are uncomparable. Snap is an unprofitable piece of crap that is dying. And while I hate FB, it’s kinda unimaginable for society to do without it at this point

/u/Hans4132 (1/0) made a bet that AMD would go to 120.0 when it was 104.86 and it did, congrats autist.
I was anxious to sell puts but my deposit didn't clear fast enough. Dodged a big bullet there.
Your explanation makes sense, why are you here you seem semi maybe intelligent?
Holy fck SPY is gonna open at like $425 tomorrow
wtf just happened with facebook? Crashed 6%...I panic bought a share
&gt; The world is coming to an end.
Keep crying out to the void, bear
I don't know how to feel about TrumpBook. Historically, most of these companies that market themselves as an "alternative" to Big Tech wind up only attracting the most angry and conspiratorial types.

Look at Parler or Gab or Voat. 

I just want a place where I can call someone the F Slur for liking pineapple on pizza, or make a joke that involves the multiple-pronoun folks without getting deplatformed. Don't need a steamy side of political activism either way, Left or Right.
Imagine having earnings so bad, you make other companies completely drill as well
Where do you think all that money that is dumping out of snap right now is going to go tomorrow? 🥭🥭
What is happening with apple? People rotating into it?
AMD is really my only tech exposure and it's green af ahaha
Probably fallout from the SNAP earnings report.
&gt; Nobody uses that app anyway

That's kind of the problem
lmfao my heaviest loss of this month will be getting assigned on written snap puts. fuck me
Cute. I want you to stop using caps.
Social media stocks down. Looks like a pair trades that went wrong. Someone probably shorted 🥭s stock. Lol
Would love a circuit breaker tomorrow
Blood red
iOS 14 privacy…
Chipotle earnings single handedly causing long bonds to sell off
Are u dump ?
Reality
Damn, there are a lot of swing plays primed right now.
MSFT, AMD, NVDA  all I ever need
GOOG AMZN INTC SNAP
Tech bout to get hurt.
They actually opened up at $3.50 but still insane returns
RIP
Just saw a quick summary of Snapchat earnings, looked good at a quick glance so I wonder why its dropping so much? Huge overreaction?
LMAO SNAP single-handedly destroying everything. Butterfly meme: is this a black swan?
Every social media down, Trumps new one coming outs coincidence? I think not
LISTEN EVERYBODY WE HAVE SO MANY STOCKS THAT JUST DUMPED FAR BELOW THERE ACTUALLY VALUE MAKE AN EDUCATED DECISION &amp; BUY SOME FUCKING CALLS
Incoming cnbc “traders” saying how they dropped snap last week 🙄
Today was not the day to have your ER
why is anyone still in intel when amd exists
QCOM AH 👁👄👁
Amd let's go ooo 🚀🚀🚀🚀
lol wtf even amazon took a plunge AH
CLF hasn't died at all you clown.
SNAP, INTC, GOOG after hours...
There is no reason to FB go down again., their yearly profit margin 37%, 0 Debt, $65 B cash in hand and they are expecting to beat the earnings next Monday.
I had my finger on SNAP calls at 3:55 but did pull it.
[deleted]
480 EOW
What the FUCK just happened to all social medias
Holy shit snap , sold 65P thinking if it shit the bed it wouldn’t be that bad lol
The twitter folks truly might be more retarded than us. I still get recommended tweets of retards talking about GME and AMC every single week saying “THIS IS THE WEEK” or “HOLD THE LINE”
Bad earnings. Ceo stepping down.
Add AMZN, GOOG, PYPL to that list
Users leaving SNAP en masse to go use TRUTH!! /s
SNAP is a chinese stock
When the real valuation would probably get it banned here
Wow snap

Lol thank fuck my SNAP call limit order never went through. Holy shit
Lisa long term
If you told me SNAP would fall more than INTC on earnings I would have laughed.
I have to say I own both FB and pypl
Not my first dog and pony show
SNAP put holders......which color lambo?
If all these stocks selling off could make vix go up that would be nice. UVXY 16.5c 10/29.
How are we going to let SNAP crash the market?? Nobody uses that app anyway

SNAP broku my ROKU!
Ok now it’s Google. WTF
#SNAP BULLS furiously watching the ads on snapchat rn 💀💀💀 and sending dick pics to Lily and Ashley to revive throwback trends
trump just snapped his fingers and destroyed half of tech
Also the number of diet cokes he drinks daily
Why tf is QQQ falling after hours
That whale did a 12% bop before close and yall think we aren't hitting ath tomorrow? Yall boys better pay attention. 

Ps I need my fucking tendies now!
Well, I could not have been more wrong about SNAP
So how bad is the SPY bloodbath gonna be tom?
How tf does a 120B company go down almost 30%
YOU GET NOTHING. YOU LOSE. GOOD DAY SNAP.

Roku, twitter, facebook, snap all falling lol
Don't worry guys I bought FB poots before close so itll be green by open tomorrow
Literally no one wants a tonal home gym just stop it
Pandemic trends reversing hard?
SNAP calls pre earnings
Google ded too damn
Today, SNAP was what you thought you'd retire on. Tomorrow, SNAP will be how you afford groceries.
everyone here like "earnings miss doesn't justify -25%" meanwhile SNAP literally doesn't make any money and was valued at 120B
AAPL up in after hours. Fuck those cocksuckers. Single handedly just killed the social media markets
Just called an ambulance bc I got a big red FB dildo stuck in my bhole. It’s all the way out my mouth now too 🤢

/u/manlygale (0/1) made a bet that AFRM would go to 160.0 when it was 148.38 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Trump destroying all the liberal big tech lololol.

Seriously though his scam ran 400% today.
snapshat?
bro who the fuck still uses snapchat anyway hahaha
So I dabbled with CFDs 5:1 leverage

YOLOD into snapchat before close

And boom.liquidated everything gone poof
Maybe it'll come back up by tomorrow at open. Ha
^ This, retards, is what we call the denial stage lol
REDemption
Trump destroying all the liberal big tech lololol.

Seriously though his scam ran 400% today.
I honestly thought it would take the Snap Map Murders to bring down this beacon of young poon.
Q3 earnings was much better than expected.
Better to be lucky than smart
the double top needed a catalyst and a social media panic might be the ticket

Literally same bet. Such bullshit; FBs numbers are in a whole other league compared to SNAP. Same with GOOG like wtf.
God damn you Snap you're fucking up my Facebook calls you nasty piece of shit I always wanted to buy puts on you fucking shit
Being a millionaire probably
How am I supposed to send unsolicited dick pics now 😩
Dune premieres tonight on HBO Max
Social media companies is kil. Nature is healing
I find it no coincidence that on the day orange man triumphs all social media gets dumped to sweeten his deal. What a win and I don't even like him. Genius.
Thanos SNAP
Permabulls watching y’all melt down right now after being so arrogant and cocky all fucking day is the best kind of justice. Get absolutely wrecked
I bought shares!
dw its only transitory

Snap lol 

What is that 5 months of gains lost in 20 minutes? 

And bulls say bears are not ruthless
10 bagger at _least_.
Probably related to SNAP losing about a third of its value
Friends, look at my history...years of experience...buy this dip right now in after-hours, buy it right now!
[deleted]
***SNAP, GO BACK 12 MONTHS, DO NOT PASS GO, DO NOT COLLECT 200$***
No wonder SNAP CBO sold stock two days ago. It was a warning
Trump’s stock ends at $45. I’m sure that was a coincidence. 45th President.
[deleted]
fuck man lol. When attempting to scalp $112 results in ~$1700 loss
where's the guy who bought 75k worth of SNAP puts. fucking genius
TWTR down 7% lmfao overreaction much?
Damn fb and twitter guhing after hours…ngl trumps social media could make them lose alot of users..
Facebook will recover. This is kneejerk
Tech opening -2% tomorrow
you gotta fix your sleep schedule friend.
I’d put that on my headstone
I got calls end of day.  Seem cheap
The fuck is happening with tech in the AH. Everything is crashing down.
SNAP blamed the revenue miss on Tim 🍏 iOS privacy settings. 

Zuckerberg fucked next week.
TRUTH
Tomorrow gonna be uggggly
SNAP puts gonna make people rich tomorrow
Guys wtf is happening to amzn after hours???
SNAP snapped!
Why would Twitter tank alongside FB and SNAP?
Same as every other day.... selling more naked AMC calls.
Oh $SNAP!

buying GOOGL and FB dip tomorrow.

hell i bought some FB shares AH just now.

Damn SNAP 55 puts were $1 at close
Yo, why is AMZN sympathy dumping?
SNAP just Thanos SNAP'd all the social media stocks
Ffr
Bought at 16.25. Feeling orangy-green.
Qqq taking a sht right now.  Big red day tomorrow
Did SNAP kill Gabby?
I hope shares not options
Who would have thought SNAP PUTs is the play
Simulation rigged
Every week the market does intriguing things 👽
Cheers to the guy who said he threw 10k in the 🥭 hope he didn’t paper hand at 20 like me
No way it will stay that low , retards will be buying this dip just because it's a dip. 60p was the play though unless they can somehow pump it AH and PM.
betting against social media stocks is the play now. LMFAO
#ALL BIG BOY STOCKS ARE DYING: PAYPAL, FB, SNAP, ROKU, INTC, CLF 

GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN BEFORE THE CIRCUIT BREAKS
What happened to FB, TWTR, GOOG, AMZN &amp; ROKU?? Also what happened to MSFT &amp; AAPL
So many shambles in the distance
Which means this is all smoke and mirrors. Buy the dip!
FUCK THE ZUCK
Holy hell what’s happening to Snap, FB, Google after hours is bananas
SNAP erasing a years worth of gains in 19 minutes. Lmfaooo
Yes. Rise Snapchat. \*cue dark knight rises music\*
'cause Lizard King Zuck gonna change Facekbook to Lizardbook
Twitter down 7% too.
Can someone tell me what happened to snap?
AMD calls and INTC puts, feelin good
🐻s gonna feast tomorrow
\*not to interrupt all of the SNAP and FB dying posts\*

MVST setup is real nice, could pop one of these days.

Reg shoutout to my boy PSFE, you're recovering real nicely and you'll take us to the promised land one day.
Buying this Facebook dip hard tomorrow, putting in 50k (net worth: 140k). Snap doing bad is good news for FB, means people are spending more time on Insta.
WTF IS HAPPENING WITH FB AND TWITTER
Spy puts will print tomorrow
Snap took everything down with it lmao.
SNAP just got snapped Holy shit 😳
Fucks wrong with Roku
I was gonna buy calls but switched to INTC credit spreads.
Fuk snap
Got hit hard was looking for it to go up

I really don’t blame anyone for thinking snap would go up on earnings but holy fuck
It's...it's...beautiful....

Wonder how this guy is doing right now?
Rip social media stonks
Geez SNAP just die and leave rest of market alone
I was looking but they were real expensive
social media stocks r fuk.
Tech is dying, INTC, FB, SNAP, PINS....
So who just became a millionaire with puts on ad based companies?
Unfortunately for SNAP the focus is on a small revenue miss, digging a little deeper they narrowed losses from previous quarter by 64% which is kind of a big deal. Either way my singular call is melted.
big tech? more like big gay
I’m fukin stupid for seeing snap puts and not buying. Fml
RIP To the guy and all his followers that were shilling 95C on Snapchat
Well fuck my $350 04/22 fb call.
Bought snapchat calls at close

Guh
Suddenly owning calls on a plane company that can't get anything right doesn't look so bad as opposed to some of this tech.
i lost everything to snap
Google said "we're changing the focus of our brand to only display feet pics"
Chipotle is now more expensive than the new macbook pro.
Holy fuck FB 😳
🙋‍♂️
Everyone knew snap wouldn’t be able to compete with mango mans new company, its getting priced in now.
I won't argue against that
#cmon I want a fuckin CIRCUIT BREAKER TOMORROW
Social media investors dead dead

This^
Oh snap my face plz 😔
WTF? FB is still beating its expectations and why people freaking out? I am not selling., will buy more
SNAP earnings bruh
probably since SNAP is dumping, similar sectors
Snapchat crushed earnings though
Wow, who else is completely fucked tomorrow
Ouchie
MODS don't want to admit this
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
oh in that case its cool
Bc snap
Theres a new king in social media
Those earning number don’t justify a -30% Market Cap slice. 

Holy Fuck
Oh SNAP!

O\_O
What the fuck is happening to ROKU 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
I thought I had a bad day but then I look at $snap... RIP holders

Too bad you’re still a tard for trying
Lol

Not telling you
LOL, just looked into all the details about this thing. Bout to be the most epic SPAC dumpster fire yet, and that’s really saying something
Swung 10/29 $450 SPY puts but took a weak position. Should've gone heavier. 

SNAP going to have people jumping out of windows.
Picked me up 100 SNAP shares for a quick bounce
 Lmao. So snap down. Twitter in the dirt. FB running of a cliff. 

Tomorrow CLF earnings. The real deal. Lourenco Goncalves make me proud tomorrow 🤙
Following SNAP. Don’t worry, I’m thoroughly fucked.
lol wtf why is google and facebook going down with snapchat


snapchat has been overtaken by ticktock, no one uses snapchat anymore it's not comparable to google or facebook at all
Imagine the gains of those who rode mango media stock today AND held SNAP puts
It's time to come together.  We are on a moon mission to save our country!
Did any news come out from snap that affect other social media?
Shareholders from google, snap, and Facebook, we welcome you to apple shareholding.
What’s happening with MSFT
Wtf google dropping 100 plus AH?
Lol SNAP is, was, and always will be trash
😂
Holy SNAP!
I was a little pissed that I didn’t buy when it was under $320 but I might get a better chance now
where were you when AD TECH GOT DESTROYEDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I was gonna buy FB calls tomorrow but nevermind lol
Someone do a wellness check on FB
AAPL mooning and FB dumpster diving. Love it
Naw SPACs aren't allowed here until post merger.
I'm guessing the SNAP ER isn't going to be a good one?
AMD always been ol reliable
Wish i sold my calls but pdt said nope
Okay all you retards that had SNAP, show yourselves ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Would you rather be P-whipped or D-wac'd?
Lol

Lol look at PINS ah. Wtf if pypl is buying then it don’t matter?
TSLA over $900 EOD tomorrow 😏
SPY $445p 10/27 gonna be a good ass buy after all this earnings hubbub
Jeezus it shit the bed, and twirled the sheets around.
NASDAQ100 +0.62% on the day, huh?
Fuck, I was going to buy $65 puts and didn't pull the trigger because it seemed ridiculous. Damn.
i have never been fucked so hard than i just did by SNAP. RIP my portfolio
Maybe buy some MAT, cuz I’m a toys r us kid
Is SNAP a sign of things to come for tech?
today is maybe the craziest ah I've ever seen
Who cares about user count if profit is pouring at record pace and ROI for advertisers are great when utilizing Google and/or Facebook. Nothing compares and why advertisers continue to flock on these behemoth platforms 

This FUD is unbelievable

Those are already dead roll to 2023 trust me.

I think it's mostly SNAP with a little mango man mixed in
&gt; I have no idea.
Jesus Christ SNAP just keeps going. Why can I never be on the right side of a trade???
SNAP LITERALLY BANKRUPTING PPL
Fb and googl will beat
Congrats to whoever bought snap puts
SNAP obliterated
Yeah I think IWM is the key here. Small caps have been consolidating for 8-9 months now and IWM is sitting just above its 200 day moving average.
Looks perfectly set to lead the way higher and most small caps are at better valuations than last year.
gotta love capitalism and FREE, LAISSEZ FAIRE, UNMANIPULATED markets

I only watch Yahoo finance for this Emily girl.
SNAP and INTL fucked us all for tomorrow. You two need to get your shit together.
If you bought SNAP calls you have an obligation to post your loss porn
Puts on Reddit IPO
Rip snap call holders
it's like 100 baggers for SNAP 10/22 55p. Holy fuck! $10000 =&gt; $1000000 just like that
no position (made small time money on puts in the 70s) but damn I'm happy SNAP died.  most overvalued large cap there is
God damn what happened to SNAP? I list 20% of my account in 5 minutes and I only hold shares lmao
Snap taking everyone down with it
Snap should announce a spin-off and a SPAC. That stock is fucked. Lol
Slightly mad now that I didn't throw $100 on some SNAP FD puts.
Just had my FB calls go woorthless omg
And from the ashes a new breed was born. The name was mangotruth
Seems like all social media tickers are getting wrecked!
SNAP's gonna clip DWAC's wings that motherfker
the SPAC is over $1 billion market cap though and it qualifies now
If you have SNAP, then its time to apply for SNAP
Leggo
Holy shit snap shit the bed big.
Welp, my SNAP $65p/$62p Credit spreads are fucked.
Do you know which site you're on?
Fuck that dip spy 457 straight fucking bullish. Get some sleep tonight bulls.
[SNAP chart or my current level of will to live ](https://imgur.com/a/1rD5mV9)

HOLY MOTHER OF SNAP
Damn I wish I was able to buy in the AH. Snap is at a huge discount now
Gonna be big red tomorrow lol. FB down 6.5% too.
Stop killing SNAP! He's already dead!!
Funny. Bought at 28 and 32 and 39. Sorry you missed out
Why the fuck did I buy FB at $340
Look how they massacred my SNAP ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Good fucking lord SNAP
To the person who was asking whether they should hold through SNAP earnings earlier…lol
Why the hell is ROKU dipping so hard as if it had its earnings 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
Guh in peace mate. You didnt deserve it this bad
It’s down $22 lol not 22% 

SNAP is actually down almost 30% though.
Is FB about to announce their re-branded name tomorrow?

Algos dumping snap hard

#HOLY FK SNAP GOT SNAPPED CIRCUIT BREAKER TOMORROW

Holy fuck Snap down 25%
Waiting for snap to consolidate then I’m going all in on calls. $74 price target &amp; a 71% buy lmaooo easy clap
I mean good, but also I held snap for earnings. The world would be a much better place without those three.
Just liquidated all my snap shares in after hours, didn’t think it would cause it to drop that much, will give you guys heads up next time, my bad.
LMAO SNAPCHAT
AAPL $155c 11/12 is an easy tell right now
Haven’t had a check up in a while
Holy fuck SNAP put holders about to get lambo money tomorrow
So cool that old social media just went off a cliff together. So normal.
[deleted]
I use it to buy weed
 Bulls about to get there horns ripped out tomorrow. Was there really people who didn’t have snap and intel puts for earnings?
Good then, glad i sold some stuff before the drop
SNAP getting crushed.
Lol the burrito company killing it. We live in a 🤡 world.
I have around 5k just sitting until it becomes withdraw-able, then I have to deposit that money into Fidelity from my bank account. Probably gonna take a week.
Wp
Oh SNAP!  I guess betting on SNAP may have been a bad idea.
Lmaooo. Crash
Well good thing my fb calls don't expire until 2022 April. Jesus
Are there any other examples of stocks dying &gt; 27% on earnings? 

I can remember 10-15% ones. But this is too much.
SNAP getting fooked up!
Anyone else exclusively invest in spy stock and trade in spy options?
**You smell that gentlemen???**

#That' the smell of LOSS PORN in the afternoon
im not looking for changing the trend or something, just a normal correction will do the trick also 4hr divergence is in play!
Facebook wtf man… dont do me like that
holy shit look at FB/GOOGL AH too

nice job tim apple
Oh snap
I'm  playing TWTR puts next. If SNAP ain't making money ,no one is
Where were you the day social media died?
looks like you are fucked
Facebook snap twitter u guys good?
I revenge trade HD way to often, sometimes it taketh..but today it giveth
Can someone explain 🥭 meaning pls? I'm drunked retarded and new
I'm a holder, but it always dumps after earnings
nobody:

snap: OH SNAP!
Every social network down Gug.
Holy fuck SNAP just killed my FB account. LMFAO
I randomly decided to sell a $69P on SNAP expiring tomorrow to cash on premiums. Looks like a huge loss incoming. Fml
Sold before close 😂
Probably. INTC has some time to catch up with the recent TSMC delays for Ryzen 4, depending on how well Pat can iterate off Alder Lake
SNAP happened
&gt; after
Sry
Rip FB calls
Thats fine and all but would you buy my snake oil?
What the fuck happened to FB after hours?
[deleted]
Fb down 22%  after close

Fuck cuckerberg
Before
Chipotle 🚀🚀🚀
CMG, americas greatest stonk
Lol BIG ‘OOF’ to FB
Yeah I couldn’t figure it out. Now that snap is down 26 percent it makes more sense. I think fb is a buy here. Not the same company folks. Tell that to the people selling amd because intel can’t get their shot together.
Snapchat uterly screwed me
SNAP puts was such an obvious play , you are living in 2015 if you are still using SNAP , everyone uses insta or tiktok. SNAP $60p is 50x bagger just in intrinsic value if the AH price stays
My 10/22 75’s are fucked now.
God I hate SNAP
I just had to buy SNAP calls...
linked to SNAP
congrats to the snap bers. ya crazy madlads
Ok so is snap gonna snap back? What's going on? Am I an official bagholder?
Snap just crashed; I made a lot of money…
they probably don't have any kind of convincing plan for future revenue growth
Someone sent an unphotoshopped picture of the Kardashians
Social dumping cause of Trumps new platform? wtf bruh
What’s mango man social media
FB dying as though Trump's social network is gonna destroy it lol
Is tomorrow finally 🐻 day?

Good INTC is a disgrace to America. Going on 60 Minutes crying and begging bringing dishonor to our great country.
Seriously SNAP is shit tier overvalued app. Fucking algos are dumb
Intel fb and snap just got fucked. Congrats everyone who bought fd puts
Remember the Thanos SNAP? Figured y'all woulda learned smh
SNAP
holy shit thats a crazy drop on snap
Closed my FB calls to buy PYPL calls. I was super upset and thought I let go of a winner to buy a loser. Thank fuck I would have been rinsed !!!!
Wow rip snap
In Jerry Seinfeld pirate voice:  I don’t want to be a bag holder!!  🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
Mods just go ahead and ban me. Ain’t no way my ban bet on SNAP goes through now
well my SNAP FD spread is gonna be worthless but thank god i trimmed it down to like only 1/3 of original position. no harm no foul.
It was just this morning that I mentioned it would be sooooo hilarious if SNAP tanks just because everyone here is buying calls blindly 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm gonna be fucked tomorrow.. Fuck fb. Damn
Chased it and I’m still up a lot. Hopefully dips tomorrow so I can get to a hundo shares with decent cost average
Same, and I’m banned today lol
I think imma be sick 🤢 wtf Snap
Stupid people trying to be “contrarian”
You're committing suicide by bot if you repeat a spam ticker (low cap, SPAC, etc) a bunch of times. It'll get you automatically temporarily banned, so don't be a smoothbrain. Use an emoji or something and don't make trading recommendations if you must comment on it.
I would've been rich if I bought SNAP CB and WHR puts
Jesus fuck my FB call is gonna be dead
[deleted]
All the SPY ATH hype had me forgetting to look into SNAP puts FUCK FUCK FUCK
Wtf happened to PINS? Why the AH dump?
RIP SNAP
I’m still on robinhood. Stop losses don’t work on options. I transferred money to tos but still can’t figure out how to trade options there
Fuck, I totally spaced on Snap earnings
SNAP is ded 💀📉📉
Godless it’s not the bug
Render unto SPY
SNAP is so bad it's gonna change its name back to Food Stamps
FB DIP AH!!! QUICK!
Well I guess I’m gonna make money for once. I bought FB straddles expiring tomorrow
SNAP down 26.6% now. And it is taking brother FB with him.  Lmaooooooooooo
Straight crashing
Lol big F for SNAP
I am sure alot of people in here wouldn't mind puffing up what you are hitting.

Puff alittle more and those bags won't fell as heavy.
guh bought fb dip too early
That's where you're wrong, Visualmod.
&gt; Nah,
Sheesh
Snap and fb mein Gott
Lol that's a 10 banger
damn I kind of feel bad for FB call holders. imagine getting fucked by SNAP like this
Snap
Never doubt the don
holy good god, can somebody explain to me how an EPS beat and slight sales miss...can cause a ~24% crater? Like how can the whole discounted cash flows yadda yadda be that heavily impacted?
[deleted]
Without me, the market is useless. Without the market, I am useless.
Oh snap
Wow guys, would you look at that huge green shrek dildo on SNAP ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I had a great day today until I remembered that money means pretty much nothing to me
Snap taking down futures already tf
After hours is a bloodbath.
Snap, straddle, pop
No one wants to sell the beautiful spy baby
Snap cock!!
I mean it sure looks fucked
Fuk I called snap put’s yesterday but I also didn’t buy
INTC dead. Rip call holders.

Cuz snap
#OHHHHHH SNAP
R.I.P SNAP
Yo FB falling 5% off SNAP's earnings? You gotta be kidding me
Ahhh fuck can’t believe you’ve done this
Why
Social media is ☠️
Well honestly there is Buona beef for better beef sandwiches, 5 guys for better burgers, and even Pops has better hot dogs. I only eat there when people who moved away come back home and have a craving. Their customer service has been getting shitty too.
Oh SNAP, there goes all my profits for the week.
IF YOU'RE NOT BUYING SNAP RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG!

Holy schnike! You get it for a quarter off! YAYAYAYAYAYAAYYAY!
Chamath saying “Buh Bye” 😂

Lose $1000 as quickly as possible.
I think today was the lowest volume day on spy since December 2020
  
Edit: look at the horizontal blue line going across the volume indicator at the bottom. That blue line is todays volume https://imgur.com/a/g3vqUM3
I mean, it could really go either way. 

If IWM and the DOW breakout here, I will believe.
Nah, I’m good
there goes my fb call
Snap lol
Snap and Facebook got Shaq slammed. Like I hope it's a joke because a sell off like this doesn't even make any sense

Holy moly SNAP 🤯
Snap is dead

Start setting trailing stop losses, or as I call it, synthetic diamond hands.
I would think a small pullback occurs after the fed announces tapering in the next meeting. Almost like clockwork there’s been a dip after fed meetings/announcements this year. I also think the inflation trade will continue for some time
My move for tommrow is hoping CLF doesn't rape me but we all know it will
Not all

Damn, stocks are actually quite fun again

Rotation out of bonds and into stocks.  Looks bullish for stocks atm.
Except it didn’t though.
These $INTC bags just keep getting heavier GUH
Intel gonna feed my kids for ages to come
Cause Intel sucks
It's fucking flat. These fucks should just admit they need to pivot to e-prostitution like onlyfans
why is SNAP taking so much time with their report?
Why is it seen as unlikely?
I know which one gave it to me too 😡
Hits 55 shortly after open tomorrow. That’s my bet. Any takers?
What was that eod dump on CLOV
So I guess this is where I give back the entire 26% gain I made on COIN, and an additional 30% making me go from +26% profit to -30% 2 weeks later. Sounds about right.
Intel next Enron btw
Ouch Intel

Are stocks gonna fall tomorrow then? Because of the fed talk?
10 year pumping along with SPY ATH and 7 straight days of green? This fuckery is rarified.
PYPL looks tasty
Playing $INTC ER is too easy, you buy $AMD calls and $INTC puts. $INTC ER are just another $AMD ER lol (with bad $INTC news being good news for $AMD)
INTC got taken behind the shed, usually bullish for AMD
INTEL (INTC) 😂😂
To be fair those are all reasons to be bullish

Closed the app because my SPY and AMD calls were just sitting and going down. Just opened and they are both up over 100% from 3 hours ago. Probably should have sold at close.... Fuck

meanwhile SPX new ATH
So is Snapchat mooning or?
If you invested in 🥭 stocks with the $1.2k check you would had turned $1.2k to $36k from kodak going from $2 to $60 , you then put the $36k into 🥭 spac to turn it to $180k.

Some stupid 460 calls for next week
I know you got a couple sugar babies you got the bug
$26
holy fuck AMD. is that gonna ride into tomorrow?
Over all, not a bad day.
I have hands made of paper. Bought 180 spy calls expiring tomorrow for .93 and sold at 1.28. Those calls closed at 1.61. Missed out on 5k
It will be a swift recovery, 260 by Friday next week. I put a ban bet on it
AMD fomo before INTC earnings is some 2d chess
Bit of both nowadays, but hopefully INTC incompetency outweighs it
Time to buy more AMD call, boyz.
Actually the pain starts tonight
damn sold nvda way to early
BB...it is still disappointin
AMD calls at close for INTC earnings was my greatest play of the year.
INTC raising 21 EPS and guidance and drilling AH. That’s about right.
Congrats and fuck you, that's all?
INTC

kekw
Sofi to 23$?
who the fuck wants second best thing to white bread?

They seriously always fuck up my order. Fuck them.
i definitely miss him lol he posted nothing but bangers, joe biden and the neolib democrat party is just like boring dystopia shit

Everything is fine. No need to further tighten your tight butthole flair  


Looks like it's about to bust up out of today's ascending triangle if you ask me. Bullish
Fucking Intel I swear to fuken god man. Wtf. Useless chip company. USELESS.
Probably. Only because ill be jacked to the tits with puts, and the market gods love to see me squirm
MindMed baby
Can 🥭 man release a SPAC every week?
Revenue miss, weak guidance, down 6% ah
Maybe time for another testing then.

Yes considering which companies are part of SPY...
AMD 👀
People called me a bag holder when I bought this morning at $29… they called me a bag holder when I bought more at $41…. What will they say when I buy more tomorrow at $100

Yeah that’s why I sold them, took profits for once instead of holding til expiry like a fucking retard

That said, I rolled some profits into a few 455c 1dte lotto tickets, LFG
451 1DTE SPY puts were too cheap to pass up on buying one 🤔
PYPL buying PINS is seen as unlikely now, can it recover from the last two days of beating now?
Wcgw buying some bullshit that’s up 300%+ on the day?
Intel goes down, AMD goes up. Such is life.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)INTC dipping hard

Fuck yes amd
I’ve literally felt like I had the flu for almost 3 weeks now. This can’t be right
I'm just here for AMD pump tomorrow lmaoo
Strangled the fuck out of some 10/22 SPY ... it's 457, 448, or Wendy's for me boys. Let's ride.
It moves on SNAP earnings which will be released soon.
And I might get Jennifer Lawrence to lick crack of my ass 🤡

Bruh snap looking pretty pathetic right now
$YANG GANG 👊🏻 where are you?
Got a clean ATH intraday and close on the S&amp;P500 there at the end.  SPY is a half point below its ATH which likely gets taken out tomorrow.

Small caps look like they're breaking out with the action of the past couple of days, look at Russell 2000/IWM.  If IWM gets above 230, that'd be a breakout for small caps, I think small caps will lead the next leg for S&amp;P 500 to 5000/SPY to 500.

Hard to see any reason to be bearish here, there is likely to be rotation between growth/value and big cap/small cap, but don't see why we'd get any major selldown.

Even interest rates/bond yields aren't that scary and most likely to just see rotation/minor dips.  Market has moved up along with bond yields the past week.

Unless JPow goes with a super fast drawdown of Fed treasury buying, there's nothing else that looks too bad on the horizon; that's probably only uncertain event ahead next few weeks.
TQQQ, expense ratio 1 percent.   

Still, gonna buy as much as I can tomorrow morning.
idk what msft is doing but im fucking in
Soon Biden's infrastructure bill is gonna shrink down to around $10. They keep taking shit out because they can't even get their own party aligned on this shit.
SPX broke ATH , SPY hasn't broken their ATH yet which is 454.05
Looking to sell puts on Portillos or slowly load up. I watched their locations grow in Chicagoland over the years and they're all still packed with drive thru lines around the building every single day from open to close, but I figure it'll take time to expand. Once it does, it's like crack.

damn. are INTC puts 5 baggers?
SNAP earnings.
Good work SoFi 👸🏻 squad. We lost a few paper hands but that alright! 💎🙌🏽

Don’t cluck the Duck 🦆
So did I.  Will rocket double now
Psfe for the life of it can’t hold gains
I still remember that gofundme scam for the wall that made millions, like for fucks sake people how dumb can you get lmao
Intel Guh
Why Intel ded
I kinda miss him tbh, and I didn't even vote
[deleted]
I like my women how I like my spy. Sticking things in my ass
INTC shitting the bed on earnings is (usually) a bullish AMD day to follow
we enforce the same rules we always enforced, since long before you made your account. don't be a smoothbrain and say the ticker if you wanna creep under the radar.
[deleted]
Yeah because their guidance will be better
Behr if you’re not a bull
Why would anyone buy Intel calls. Bad news has been coming out for months now about shortages and how their tech is old and shit.
Just get the off brand thinner from home depot.
Was hoping for a bounce on PayPal today. Only thing bouncing were my cheeks from PayPal’s red dildos
Ticker literally should have been MAGA
Shit tier guidance damn
Dinosaur goes bye bye unless drastic changes help it
Raise your hand if you had a tossed salad today
[deleted]
MAGA is back.  no more fake news, no more censorship,  no more cancel culture.

DWAC is worth at least 20B.
yer gonna be shocked when the market absolutely moons on taper announcement...
Plan for tomorrow? Get drunk.
Counting your chickens I see.
SPY closed at a record high for the first time since September 2nd. We're back!
volume ain't what prints
Never regret money made, there is no crystal ball the SPY has gone retarded suddenly
well i just made a butt load on INTC puts at 55
Champagne for everybody.
What about SNAP?
Wtf INTC
SNAP with a giant order 3 minutes after close.
How bad is there ER? I’m stuck at work..
INTEL SEES 4Q ADJ REV ABOUT $18.3B, EST. $18.26B
*INTEL STILL SEES FY ADJ REV ABOUT $73.5B, EST. $73.65B
*INTEL SEES 4Q ADJ EPS 90C, EST. $1.02

Shares trading lower on the Q4 EPS guidance
Is it even an AH thread if /u/fit-mycologist-6951 doesn't ask how boobies feel?
So we're back to ATHs?
the British guy on CNBC has such a punchable face
Is it a coincidence SPY reaches ATH on the same day mango SPAC goes live?
Closed out of 3 spy call spread  to lock in profits. I’ve been burned and learned. Still have some 11/5 452c open to continue the run
I have clinical depression and no friends
Uhhh did FB earnings release or something? Lots of volatility AH
Me neither, bear corpses everywhere
Dick pics don’t come cheap
I want to get into huffing paint. What brands do y'all recommend?
Of course it closed at $45. Top kek.

Hell of a day. Comrades in shambles.

I may be tomorrow, but for tonight, we get a $4 hungry man and no fucking Ramen!!!

*spartans roar*
Who could not predict that?!
INTC btfo 

AMD bulls stay winning
Yo fools, any black swan events scheduled to crash the market this weekend?  Thanks 😘
Couldn’t help myself.  Bought puts in Tesla at close
Yes
F5 this site until it's out: https://investor.snap.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx
I'll be watching PYPL, I think it starts its move back towards 250 tomorrow and by Friday next week is close to 260. This is a major overreaction on something that not even close to being confirmed
Lost 1400 today 🥳 can’t wait for tomorrow
Dice voice “What’s going on?”
$DWAC got me up quite nice. Thanks orange man
On ridiculously low volume. The dump after all this will be hilarious.
SAM yolo
If we knew we’d all be rich(er than we are now)
&gt; Yeah, I'm in the same boat.
[deleted]
still kinda shocked JPOW was trading options while pumping the market. Shit is getting real weird...
INTC:

1.71 EPS vs 1.11 expected

18.09b Revenue vs. 18.24b

My call credit spreads are laughing their way to the bank
INTC puts before earnings have been an absolute money maker for the last year and a half. I can almost retire.
Bought calls last minute 🤤
uh oh Bulls,  Jpow gonna be coming your asses in november
Bought spy puts all afternoon…at least tomorrow is Friday
Intel hahahahahaha
Just buy AMD goddamnit but y'all won't listen 😂😂😂😂
I know right? 😂 😂 did make 300% but really nothing on WSB. Probably on WSB now since it’s crazy price with no prospectus and no product. Very little shares of DWAC but will get into the SPAC for buzzfeed before thanksgiving. I’m more into buzzfeed kind of news.
#BEARS DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT SPECIES WOMEN ARE
Got 8 SPY 10/22 459c lottos at close for .02.  Godspeed SPY
Intel Brutalized
I like my stocks like I like my Beyblades. Ripping.
Just give it up.
man intc really is a shit stock! value trap looking ass like boeing
My 🥭 gains aren’t showing up in my closed positions.  🤔 puts on fidelity?
Reeeeeee!
Intel has always been a garbage company lmaoo
ATH is 454.05

Holy shit. Snapchat is worth more than IBM. What a time to be alive.
Rest assure guys tomorrow is green i bought SPY puts!
Jpow and the Fed printing to distract everyone of their insider trading.
Lmfao big fat fucking rip to anyone who thought INTC calls through earnings were a good idea.
That costs extra! 😭
Leave the casino open damn it !
hookers n blow
CLF earnings tomorrow.

Will possibly reassess strategy and target.
Death, taxes, and INTC falling after earnings.
[deleted]
VIX calls a week out just because of how many green days in a row and how low it is. 

That and holding mango man stock.
Congrats and fuck you INTC put holders
INTC is down making me become more confident of AMD calls

Personally I am going for loss porn
That AMD pump at the last hour 💦💦
Get my spicy nuts ready

There ain't nothing stopping this rocket ship to 5000. 

Resistance is futile
Was up 29% and now red trading sideways, what a sick day.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ic0lVDJyo ♥️
The Power of Socialist B’s can Suckenburg my JackedNuts
What a fucking surprise, Intel crashed for the 56th time in a row after reporting earnings.
My Paycheck tomorrow going straight to SPY puts 🤷🏿‍♂️
Intel died
The last minute candle on PYPL 🐻
Holy shit.  This volatile marker gives me sea sickness.

Fucking crazy I know the future.
KED, Michael Jordan steak house TN
As usual didn't have enough money in my decent % trades
Let's go SNAP.
logically spy should go down below 450 tomorrow
Apparently SPY just beat the earning today. Breaking news.
Ended the day in the green 🚀
RIP INTEL
Today was cool lol. I did a bunch of dumb shit and it all worked for some reason
You guys really gonna give money to some abominable mango for him to tell you how he won an election he lost. Just give me the money and I can tell you that.

You’d think after getting fucked by SPY puts so many time that I’d stop, right? Guess I’m just that gay 🥲
Bye INTC

You had first comment why did u delete it lol
Spy absolutely hulk smashed through ath like it was the house of cardboard that bears will be living in
Got out of my qqq calls end of day. I'll get back in Tommorow but was up 15% so no point in risking overnight
[deleted]
probably sell my INTC 50p 10/29, and see what happens with the AMD 120c 10/29 and SPY 460c (lol) 10/25
Give me the champagne bottle. I want one.
Today is probably going to alter the market paradigm for the rest of the year
I’m with you brother.
INTC wtf After hours?
Glad Tesla held that price.
Spy leap up 3% 😎
Damn we might get a +10% day on TSLA tomorrow
WISH

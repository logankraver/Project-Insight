Basically what Im saying is calls on Sega to do something stupid.
Well I bought JCS for the special dividend, expected a drop after the payout (which is today), but I wasnt expecting nearly a 50% drop! Fock me in the dickhole...

Looks like Ill be doubling my position, averaging down, and holding till retirement. Wasnt the plan but... I would sell calls on it but they don't have any options. Any idea how to find out if they are working on making the stock optionable?
Oh it is and will

I don‚Äôt get the hate on plug, my calls 4x on Thursday I had a  great week. Including that dominos and spy run really made my portfolio stronger
true true, that is the plan

How do I apply to be the new Fed chair
One concern: Friday‚Äôs monthly option expiration has the potential to spur bigger price swings in subsequent days. Since option dealers buy and sell underlying stocks to keep a neutral position, the need to hedge decreases once options mature. To Nomura Securities strategist Charlie McElligott, the rollover this time would see market makers‚Äô equity exposure to the S&amp;P 500 drop off by 35%, removing some pressure on the market to stay in a range.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists including Vishal Vivek and John Marshall echoed the view, noting Friday‚Äôs expiration of $703 billion of single stock options was the third highest on recored outside January. Their study found that while the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs volatility on expiry days this year has been consistent with pre-pandemic levels, the first day of trading after the monthly event was wilder, with the index swinging an average 1%, almost double the move in the 2012-2019 period.

In other words, brace for some turbulence Monday.

An around 23% plunge over just three sessions in one of China‚Äôs most prominent health care stocks has apparently made the company‚Äôs chief lose his calm.  


  
Dental hospital chain operator Topchoice Medical Corp plummeted as much as 8% to take three-day losses to the steepest since 1996 at one point. The stock, which pared the retreat to 4.7% at the close, started plunging before the firm‚Äôs earnings report, and analysts have cut profit estimates for higher costs of its expansion plans.  


  
The company‚Äôs chairman over the weekend responded aggressively to an article by an internet user that said the stock‚Äôs high valuations were not matched by earnings. Bloomberg cannot verify the identity of the user, who published the remarks on online stock investor forum [Xueqiu.com](https://Xueqiu.com).  


  
‚ÄúFoul-mouthed‚Äù investors are not welcomed by the company, a user with the handle Jimmylui, whose account was verified by the platform as Topchoice Chairman Lv Jianming, commented under the article. Their purchase of the firm‚Äôs shares is ‚Äúa humiliation,‚Äù he added. The account has since been deleted.

The year is 2077, PLTR owns the source code of the robot you call "wife", and directly profits from every interaction you have with "her". Registering your mood, tone, sexual performance, work performance, diet, and the whole fuckin rest of ya to produce the optimal way to extract capital from you. Turns out today it's a pink tie bc you need to feel "eccentric" after a night of pushing rope into the wad ofself replicating stem cells you call your robot wifes pussy. Next thursday it will be a McRib after your attempy to standout has been either crushed or underwhelming leaving you feeling there is a hole within you that can only be filled by pork. You fatty mcfatfatfuck. PLTR sends their stock picks every 5 seconds to all shareholders, and is always right. The stock sits directly at 50% value of NYSE.

Why the Chinese real estate crisis could spin out of control: no one wants to tell the Dear Leader his policy is causing an economic problem. No one feels comfortable making moves to fix it without approval because of previous purges.

Marina del Ray. Has its own vibe to it and feels ‚Äúless‚Äù crowded than Manhattan beach and Santa Monica, to me at least. But any commute, even a couple blocks, can be a bitch in that area. Get yourself an electric bike if you can. I know Culver City is east of the 405, so all this could be unreasonable depending on where your office really is.
They have half of that after liabilities. And all that cash just gives them a 6 months runway. They still have to pay expenses and salaries. If they declared bankruptcy tomorrow they could save $1 or so per share and give it back to people.

500 is enough to stop the negative weekly draws.  There is only 1 part of the oil cycle you want to be invested in and that is from Bust till Boom.  Once you hit the boom the money has been made, best you can hope for at that point is dividends and fuck all that noise, leave it to the boomers.  I have been heavy in oil since last September and made a ton of money on it.  If there is more to make it won't be much, I'll move my money someplace more productive.  I will keep some OXY though.  They have some seeds spouting with their low carbon ventures that I still want to own.
Bull are completely, utterly and absolutely fucked.
Very helpful, VisualMod

One of the major car dealers here has a nearly empty lot, i seen like 4 commercial trucks 2 vans and like 6 of those crappy suv but not a suv things, 5 years ago that place would have had about 100 for sale
Yeah I haven't shaken the feeling that path may be the most likely. They haven't gotten a good handle on future rates change when their data is backward looking. Like a month back
Not really that hard. Buy $CROX get rich.
I have been holding on to a nice selection of long calls fo RDS.A and RDS.B, and a couple in XOM to exercise at future dates (next year). The options are all very green right now and have been which is nice. 


I also have about 10% of my account value in RDS.B and XOM shares meant for long term dividend reinvested gains. If you look at the max charts for RDs.A/B (Shell) you will see there‚Äôs still massive rebound to be had post covid not to mention wonderful dividends. Reinvestments automatically will only help wi tu out me touching it.
What about their 1.5B cash lmao

You don‚Äôt really get China. After several unsuccessful attempts to deleverage the property sector, Xi isn‚Äôt backing off now. 

There‚Äôs a Chinese expression called killing the chicken to scare the monkeys. Evergrande is that chicken and Xi is killing it. The monkeys are the other property companies and their backers and creditors.

From oil price rising, time to secure permits, to finding an available rig, a week to drill a hole, the process does take a few months.

Rapidly slowing growth, high inflation that‚Äôs starting to look persistent, supply chains in chaos, fiscal stimulus package looking doubtful, another fight in a month about debt ceiling again, a taper with rates increasing behind it and the market near ATH. But yeah, China.
Been reading about empty shelves at grocery stores across the country due to supply shortages. Anyone seen this because I haven't.
Except for that. Of course it also depends where you live. I saw tons of Teslas in Cali.

Have you noticed that SPY takes a nose dive on the 18th or slightly thereafter every month?  I‚Äôve got my UVXY calls in place, so I can move those gains into SPY calls.

I remember idling in line in the back seat of a Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham.  500 c.i. engine but it had V8-6-4 cylinder deactivation technology so it wouldn't use much gas... but it kept breaking so the mechanic down the block had deactivated the feature.  I worried we wouldn't make it to the front of the line.

It was 1977.  My shirt was beige.  It said Op on the front, short for ocean pacific, and there was a line-art sunset printed on it that would have done /r/cyberpunk proud.  The leather seats were navy blue and very cushiony.

"For months in the runup to the 2008 financial crisis, banking heavyweights from Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke on down said the turmoil in subprime mortgages would be ‚Äúcontained.‚Äù

  
That phrase is now making a comeback in Beijing as regulators try to reassure markets that the world‚Äôs second-largest economy can weather the crisis at China Evergrande Group. Investors are hoping Chinese policy makers prove more adept at ringfencing the damage than their Wall Street counterparts were.

  
People‚Äôs Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said at a virtual meeting of the Group of 30 on Sunday that authorities ‚Äúcan contain the Evergrande risk‚Äù even as the embattled developer ‚Äúcasts a little bit of concern.‚Äù Another PBOC official called the situation ‚Äúcontrollable‚Äù at a news briefing on Friday, echoing statements from several of the country‚Äôs largest lenders in recent weeks."

Exercise can be something simple like just going for a walk. Buy yourself wireless headphones and go for a walk with music or audiobook on.

Do some small exercises and day yenno to start a day. Like do 50 push ups a day, 50 squats and situps Monday through friday. Also Walk around for 30 minutes or go for a run. Then slowly increase those activities

I had a Bulgarian friend who told me Turkish girls always want to take it in the ass, because religiously it's not virginity etc.
I'm more confused by all you who seem to struggle to find these girls. Or you can find a girl who's never tried it and isn't sure. 

Step 1. Play with her ass a lot. 

Step 2. find a point in time shortly after she's showered to get extra frisky and eat the booty. 

Step 3. She will probably want/be willing to give it a try. 

Step 4. Have lube (this is very important) would recommend KY either the jelly or higher quality water based: just fucking avoid warming/scents/etc. 

Step 5. Congrats you have now probably found a girl who likes anal.

Edit: Oh and anyone first timing this go slow you fucking animals. This isn't 0DTE it's a god damn leap so you take your sweet time till she encourages you to speed up otherwise odds are she's gonna nope the fuck out of it.

You need to find a time sink for something you enjoy other than eating. I know a couple of people who ended up in a similar situation, in where they basically didn't have enough interests to fill their day, so they simply ate food to fill the time.

While a lot of the suggestions here are good, I‚Äôll add on that you have to get yourself out of this mindset.

You can change diet, workout, etc, but if you still have this mindset you will not be able to stick to any new routine. 

The first step I think is to find someone irl you feel comfortable talking to about this. It will be a weight off your shoulders. If you can afford a psych visit, go for it. Also hopefully you have supporting family / friends who will be there for you. People who care about you want to see you be healthier. 

You‚Äôre doing it for yourself, but having outlets to talk through the ups and downs is huge. I‚Äôve always been into fitness / nutrition etc, and I was there for my brother as he worked his ass off to lose 80lbs.

So how‚Äôs me boy Tesla lookin?
Intermittent fasting. Try this: don't eat a bedtime snack, or at least try to eat it a little early. 

When you wake up, take a look at the last time you ended up eating. You might already be damn near 12 hours into a fast. The magic starts after hour 16. Skip breakfast. Drink plenty of water. Calorie free coffee and energy drinks are looked down upon but are not technically cheating.

Try to skip lunch. If you can't, see if you made it to 16 hours. You can now eat for about 8 hours, I'd recommend one light meal, one heavy meal, and one snack. Don't go crazy but yeah you can fill up and even have some junk.

If you made it past 16 hours without food, you're in the bonus round. Your body is taking your fat for reserves. Your liver and other organs are getting an awesome rest and the brain is about to reward you with endorphins. Ultimately, see if you can get to 20/4, 20 hours of fasting and 4 hours feeding window. 

You'll drop the most weight right away, which will get you hooked and give you momentum and motivation. The first 25 lbs will disappear then the game gets a little harder. You can do it!

Honestly, find healthy food and exercise that you enjoy and look forward to. Losing weight is a lifestyle change. Don't force yourself to do some crazy regime that you won't stick to.

Test is best.
Legit I tried the burnt orange thing and other trends nothing worked.
Plus he knows Diess is totally obsessed with Tesla. He had Mission ‚ÄúT‚Äù, an initiative to catch up. He can‚Äôt shut up about catching up and becoming some sort of German Tesla. The board almost got rid of him.

Finally somebody posts their calls. What is it with these ppl

I‚Äôm selling my tsla call before they report earnings.

Hey retards,

I‚Äôve got a Med school interview to my top choice tomorrow starting right at market open. Please send good vibes, will report back in the thread tomorrow. Oh and üêª are üåà
Damn it you son of a bitch beat me to it
Set some limit buys/sells. Sleep in
Anybody here ever lost their smell and taste? What did you do to get it back? (My doc said he can‚Äôt do anything about it)
Ya
Nah you gotta blast hella loud music at 6am. She gotta know you're passionate about trading.
Ok
For futures trading outside of intraday hours  I believe you do.
Of course they are Russki, the odds for many things are possible.

This seems like a you thing not a we thing tbh
I'm hoping to sell my just the tips bet and get a clean conscience. Betting on inevitable inflation feels so counter productive. I mean, I know it's making the best of a bad situation, but I stand to lose so much more than I'll gain with this little trade just in gas prices and food and shit.
So, Potential market crash from the energy crisis launching oil into $100 a barrel.

I'm okay with it.

The odds are possible
MEEEEEEEEEEEE
Red or green tomorrow

If you‚Äôre playing earnings I believe the smart thing to do is: 

1. Buy deep in the money options with low Vega 
2. If you‚Äôre bullish SELL Put spreads 
3. If you‚Äôre bearish SELL call spreads 

I believe this is the right way in a high IV environment. 

They‚Äôre pricing in a 60 point move for TSLA so you Gona need a hell of a move to really get those options moving
S I M P
Elon knows his advice is almost meaningless. VW is a much older company and it‚Äôs hard to get to turn around. Tesla is using Generative Engineering and is improving manufacturing at an exponential rate. 

VW will be #2 no matter what. Elon doesn‚Äôt want to be a monopoly, in the car business in Germany/EU.
&gt; Yes.
Wait for real? It's a game like what I described?

Did someone mention sloths?
 Here's a random fact!

A sloth's laziness is actually a great method of survival. The slow movement and camouflage helps it evade detection from natural predators.
The real move is buying a lambo and having contractors make a bunch of noise building you a pool when the bear market hits.
Try being naked behind wendys more often.

It‚Äôs tough to decide between going to work, playing Pok√©mon go, or trading, every weekday. 

I always say I‚Äôll play Pok√©mon go on the weekend but I hate walking and get bored driving around in like 15 minutes so I end up wasting the whole weekend looking up trading plays for the next week only to do nothing but play with spy.

I‚Äôm so tired.

Nice feet. What‚Äôs your OF?

Oh snap I didn‚Äôt know you needed at much all I have is 150$ cash. Wendy‚Äôs been slow.... to much competition now a days. No I‚Äôm a seriousness how much you really need?
Imagine an imaginary family member that doesn't exist needing 4k to have a coyote bring them across the border, and that they'll pay you back within a year at double the price... and you don't pay until they're safely in the states, then your mom - who you totally don't still live with - guarantees she'll pay you in case the family member flakes for whatever reason.

&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is a company that makes electric cars. It has been in the news recently because of its CEO, Elon Musk, smoking weed on Joe Rogan's podcast and then tweeting about taking Tesla private at $420 per share. The stock price went up after this tweet but it was not clear if he was serious or just joking around with his friend Joe Rogan who smokes weed all the time.

My thoughts on SPY 450 EOY here's why... This is huge for bulls. sorry bears... SPY has dropped dramatically in the past and the time to buy was about 430. 100 percent bulls bought there and after that is started to rise dramatically. Its been steady around to 440-445 ish and is most likely gonna stay there for a while longer. if it were to rise to 450 throughout the year it would 100 percent drop back down to 445 and stay level around there again so I wouldn't get to excited if it hit 450 out of nowhere. Thoughts on this?

Virtually 100% of the time you're not interacting with retail when you sell or buy options but algos and MM's.

Just because options have two sides doesn't mean that one side must be "correct".  MM's can make money because they fluidly delta-hedge every minute of every day, with minimal or zero transaction costs.

Retail cannot do the same.  With PFOF and poor execution you're getting raped unless you have really good directional insight or some kind of hard DD.

Range-bound stocks are rare.  And if a stock is actually good it will jump at some point.  Most stocks have their largest rallies in a period over a couple days.

Let's be real.  99% of retards here aren't actually timing the market correctly.  If you REALLY like the ticker and are short-term mildly bearish or bullish it occasionally makes sense.  But people often talk about CC's as a regular strategy on all their tickers and it's fucking stupid as hell.

Upvote me.
I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôve done less than 5 hours research.
China's growth coming in at 4.9% y-o-y on their official numbers is fairly shocking even with the presumed on-going housing bust.  (Real numbers are probably worse).

Most amazing thing is that they're actually forcing themselves into these rolling blackouts by shutting off Australian coal at the same time as this housing bust is going on...

It makes plenty of sense for them to convert the economy to cleaner energy over time given how many issues they have in terms of air quality and the like, but to try to do it so heavily at this moment just seems bizarre given how much emphasis they put into presenting nice and tidy economic numbers the past 3 decades.

TBF, Burry said right from the beginning that his play was never against Tesla but against the market. Due to their very high PE, and crazy 2020 run, his put position was due to the fact he assumed it would crash even harder than the market if the market crashed. My understanding is he has nothing against the company itself.

True: but you can drink while you golf.  If you drink at the gun range you get called "irresponsible."
But some conspiracies like say 911 might be part true, and the evidence might not exist. You don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true or not! You can‚Äôt because the evidence is lost! There‚Äôs no absolute, truth is relative! A conspiracy theorist might be right or wrong and you might never know. You don‚Äôt have complete knowledge of the universe and don‚Äôt get to decide what is right and what isn‚Äôt.

I wonder how much higher it can really go tbh? Private schools when you add up total costs come pretty close to 300k across the board. The people who get fucked the hardest are those who aren‚Äôt poor but aren‚Äôt rich either. The people with family incomes between like 100-200k. They pretty much can‚Äôt shell out that type of yearly tuition to help their kids and they don‚Äôt get any need based subsidies either. So the kid ends up taking 300k as loans. Now imagine if that kids wants to get a graduate degree because outside of engineering job pay straight out of undergrad is pretty ass. You could be looking at an easy extra 200k and all that is is compounding at 6-8% interest.

Just realized my cat has two extra fingers
The 5k Toyota or Honda is what makes gasoline worth the price but I was talking about exclusively new shit being where gasoline isn't worth the price. When they were making gasoline cars in 2006 it kinda made sense because we were still gonna have cheap crude oil for a while and buying one of those cars at 15 year old prices still makes sense to get a few thousand miles out of with the crude oil we still have left. In 2021 we're almost out of cheap crude oil and the car companies are just straight up preying on fools by continuing to manufacture gasoline engines because they don't want average people to be able to afford to drive anymore as our oil based infrastructure continues to collapse under the increasing cost of oil. They know the more people they let get their hands on diesel or electric vehicles the more people have a chance of obtaining their own power sources their vehicles can use without crude oil, like biodiesel or solar panels. You can replace 100% of the crude oil in diesel with corn but only 15% of the crude oil in gasoline.

If you do want the benefits of buying brand new, the current GMC Savana diesel is a lot like the E350. The engine only has 4 cylinders but it seems ok, small engines can move a lot of weight these days especially with diesel torque, there just hasn't been much time for it to develop a track record. On the other hand an old gas powered E350 might be so much less expensive it doesn't matter if it doesn't last long before gas runs out, or an old diesel powered E350 might be just as reliable and less expensive at the same time depending on whether you're more concerned with having the most current warranty or the most tried and true long lasting engine with a track record.

If you want a brand new vehicle there aren't many good options for you at all but at least a diesel might last long enough to be worth the cost. If all the diesel options available in the US this year are too shitty for you that's understandable, I feel the same way, but that doesn't make it sensible to buy a brand new gasoline engine, it just means you're stuck with the used car market where you might find something more worth how long it will last and at least you're not getting tricked into funding the production of new gasoline engines when their fuel is running 2021 levels of low.

If you're still buying a gasoline powered car brand new in 2021, you really need to do more research on chemistry and macroeconomics. Electric and diesel powertrains are a lot less likely to suddenly stop having energy available in the near future.

China not growing as quickly doesnt necessarily mean bad things for the US market.  Could mean they are losing market share in some industries (which wouldn't be surprising considering all the shipping issues).   That might be bullish.  Or we might not care at all.  Idk I'm just an idiot gambler

Ben should retire. I strongly believe that and will not change my mind.
Most cars with navigation systems from the factory between 2000 and now actually didn't have mobile data connections. 2000 is about 10 years sooner than Tesla started having them in every car and about 20 years sooner than other manufacturers started putting out EVs and using the need for charge point navigation as an excuse to make no exceptions among their EVs either. It will still be a while before they feel like eliminating exceptions on the ICE side and coming up with excuses for that. Not that it matters to me, there are no good ICE vehicles coming out in the US anymore anyway, so I'll just settle for an EV with dead connectivity features bitching at me with their error messages.

From early 2000 till now gets tracked by gps. Some makes have services that read OBD2 diagnostics in real time. GM has onstar it can track and listen to you and shut off the vehicle start it lock and unlock doors. Simple solution find your cars antenna that is connected to the satellite radio and put a faraday cage on it.

For real tho, just imagine if Tesla had to be like "welp 95% of customers are taking the mobile data hardware out of their Teslas and just giving up the internet connected features to avoid the closed source software spying on them, and that's not even counting all the people who just aren't even customers because this makes them not even want to buy an electric car so who knows how much this is impacting our sales. I guess we just have to stop collecting data people aren't willing to consent to having collected and make all our code open source" 

That would be amazing. Too bad at least 95% of people are retarded and less than 5% have functioning brains instead of the other way around
Ooh- when that China GDP news drops‚Ä¶

You don‚Äôt get it bro, Joe Rogan is back! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
&gt; I am watching the market.
Harris is doing really well! And Steelers are winning which is cool! Cowboys won earlier but no one cares. What you watching?
&gt; Joe Rogan is a famous American stand-up comedian, actor, martial artist and podcaster. He was born on August 11th, 1967 in New Jersey.
The CIA has no fucking idea what theyre doing. Seriously. The amount of big brain nonsense there is staggering. The only thing they do right is the James Bond shit. Their takes on big state level stuff, unless highly person specific, is literally toilet paper
Love it ‚Äî and I agree. Buying 13C for this week. Should be .04 tomorrow at open, think they‚Äôll be 4x that midweek.
how? Joe Rogan just died like an hour ago?

I wish enough people had enough brain function to take the mobile data hardware out of their EVs so that the data people actually consent to sharing would be worth enough for an auto maker to use open source software in an EV and provide useful connectivity features to obtain that data. Instead there are so few people who would take out the mobile data hardware that the auto makers lose virtually nothing by giving up all the data they could have gotten with consent from people with functioning brains to instead collect whatever data the vast majority of people will be dumb enough to give them via closed source software regardless of consent. So those of us with functioning brains aren't given an open source or at least non-internet-connected choice available on the market, and if we want to buy an EV we have to remove the internet connectivity from it and then drive it around in a weird Frankenstein state of functioning car mixed with non functioning gimmick features, probably with constant error messages complaining to the driver about how the gimmick features can't find an internet connection.

Hydrogen comes from hydrocarbons.  You could use nuclear power to separate it but you could use any energy source.  Their is nothin unique to nuclear energy about creating hydrogen.  Fission energy comes from release of neutrons from uranium atoms.  Fusion uses hydrogen atoms to make helium but that is not feasible technology

Considering they said I was being banned for being "toxic," seems obvious the answer is they project their toxicity on the well-informed so anyone who knew enough to answer my question was already banned for being even more "toxic" than me with all their knowledge. Psychological projection is one of the key elements to maintaining a toxic community and censorship of intellectuals is another so they kill two birds with one stone by this tactic

Plot twist: it's Elon's secret reddit account.
Back in 2009 was looking for some weed in London. Saw some young blokes in McDonalds and asked them. One bro rose the bus with me to this dude house and when we got there this black dude with no shirt jumps off the balcony sporting his British accent.

He was impressed with my English accent and said I could get all the girls there with it.

Weed was good and the bro who brought me there was a top tier mate
The majority of which has been in the last two years. In the grand scheme of things, not the best investment over that time period.
Then we agree.  That‚Äôs exactly what I said

It seems that I‚Äôve underestimated how retarded someone could be. To reply to what you said‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs always a choice. It‚Äôs so easy to make above minimum wage especially rn during covid. If you‚Äôre trying to take care of a family on minimum wage you need to take a step back and look at your options. Whether that is going back to school or getting some other certification that will make you seem more valuable to a business. I think McDonald‚Äôs starts at like $15 or something where I live and Amazon also has many warehouses that you can stay at like $19/hour. Any other comments you‚Äôd like to add?
No. If news about a company is released, it immediately gets priced in. The point is you can‚Äôt price in a black swan, and a black swan can happen literally any time. So you‚Äôre basically just gambling in a casino.
Nope

Yes, but in the real world with the technology we have. Tesla exists in the real world where it went from $50 to $800. Hoping that it will make another leap like that (or anything close) is like hoping your car can keep accelerating exponentially just because it did so one time.

chinese gov hates every USA app üòÇ facebook twitter and so on.Even Chinese app is also be hated by gov because gov can not 100% ensure people do not say some bad words about them

Êª¥Êª¥ his managers name is liuqing, her father call liu chuanzhi , this guy recently  lost his network with govs big boss. So didi is a good company but its manager is bad.

you can search liuchuanzhi

he is Lenvos founder and also he is the first generation of  IT companys billionaire in China.Like the  most billionaire in china he also is a former state-owned companys leader,he got very strong political background before.

for now didi is still the first choice of  call taxi app ,still in store. you know sometimes if a cunt  kill some one in a car which is send  by  didi ,gov will rectifies didi for several weeks or longer."

Lol of course I mean a lot of people also value their life more than money. But you always have the desperate in society who value money above all else as they think it will solve all their problems. But you probably won't get as many truly desperate people like squid games portrays because the US has some very lax and lenient bankruptcy laws.
Oil just keeps on trucking up.  Inflation is gonna explode this Christmas

The "priced in" argument doesn't capture the full picture. You also got a huge amount of cash just sitting around because people are scared of buying into stocks with this inflation/tapering doomsday rhetoric. What would happen if they all FOMO into the market and indirectly lift $TSLA too? The "priced in" argument should just die already, it has no place in this environment.

Raytheon RTX it also reports this coming week and not many are talking about it.  They say the most graceful victory is the battle &amp; war that wasn‚Äôt fought.

If CCP does attack it will most likely start with an air strike and this bad boy will be waiting. Wonder how many they already sold and how many more will be approved.

I think a lot of people forget the marginal utility of money after a certain point. 45M is a shitload of money bro. Anyone could retire like a king on that for the rest of their life. There isn‚Äôt a substantial quality of life difference between that and a 100M or 500M for the most part. My uncle is worth mid 8 figures and has friends in the 9 digit club and even 1 billionaire friend (his old boss). Their lives are really not that much different. All of them have complete free time to do what they want. The differences are extremely minor and don‚Äôt really change your quality of life. My uncle and his friends usually charter private planes or fly first class while the billionaire flies his Gulf Stream. All of them rent Yachts vs buy including the billionaire as he realized it‚Äôs a money drain that he barely uses. They all stay in 5 star hotels. The billionaire has a chauffeur and chef that‚Äôs the only big lifestyle difference I see. My uncle instead eats at higher end restaurants and drives a Model S. Your net worth might be 25x from 40M to 1B  but it‚Äôs a minuscule  jump in quality of life compared to what you get from say 40k income to 1M. Basically what I‚Äôm trying to say is a lot of people would play squid games for 40M when the average person makes 50k a year as the jump in quality of life would be massive.

Have you been paying attn? Almost all of the bearish catalysts have faded or are priced in at this point. Spy double bottomed and broke above its last lower high. The downtrend that began on Sept 2 has been broken. You bears had 6 weeks of a downtrend, how are you still expecting it go down?

One concern: Friday‚Äôs monthly option expiration has the potential to spur bigger price swings in subsequent days. Since option dealers buy and sell underlying stocks to keep a neutral position, the need to hedge decreases once options mature. To Nomura Securities strategist Charlie McElligott, the rollover this time would see market makers‚Äô equity exposure to the S&amp;P 500 drop off by 35%, removing some pressure on the market to stay in a range.   
 

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists including Vishal Vivek and John Marshall echoed the view, noting Friday‚Äôs expiration of $703 billion of single stock options was the third highest on recored outside January. Their study found that while the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs volatility on expiry days this year has been consistent with pre-pandemic levels, the first day of trading after the monthly event was wilder, with the index swinging an average 1%, almost double the move in the 2012-2019 period. 

  
In other words, brace for some turbulence Monday.

We haven‚Äôt had WW3 yet because the nation state as a basis for social cohesion has dissolved and most conflicts have become multinational, corporate, and mercenary, all for the sake of being more agile. This has basically been the case since Nixon learned that having a civilian army is how you have an unpopular war. Sports on TV is just a way for people to transfer their inner antagonisms to an external bearer.

We just need a few social media companies to fact check everything because they're smarter than average. Also, the government should crack down on hate speech. A lot of transphobic speech should be criminalized. Racism should be outlawed, too. The path to a better society is outlawing thoughts and behaviors which contradict our values. It's a progressive future. Join us or be left in the dustbin of history.

Sml penis
Oh shit here comes Tim McGraw with the Duct Tape.
So I‚Äôve heard (on Reddit) that penis inspection day was a normal thing for a lot of elementary schoolers. I never recall such a thing though as a boy who grew up in the 90s‚Ä¶ though I guess I could‚Äôve just blocked out the memory? I DO remember getting my penis inspected at the doctor though, because I recall him telling me that I needed to pull back my foreskin when I peed. The thought of that happening in a group setting at school seems so strange to me. 

IF it‚Äôs a real thing and redditors aren‚Äôt just fucking with me, when and where were you in elementary school? Is it something that only happened in the ‚Äúolden days,‚Äù or is penis inspection day still a thing today? 

I just have so many questions‚Ä¶
That‚Äôs literally what it‚Äôs supposed to be lol
I have a house. But my dad had three by the time I was his age. His personal residence was bought for the equivalent of 50k in today's dollars. Now it would easily sell for 500k.

I mean jealous may not be the right word. Lost a ton chasing the bottom for 6 weeks now. Had some Green Day‚Äôs for sure and maybe even close to being break even at present but it has not been a big win by any stretch of the imagination.

The thing about Batman is anyone can be fuckin Batman. So he seems a little soft? Bruce Wayne is supposed to be a soft little bitch boy living on his trust fund.
What does that have to do with what i said? You dont put a meme on your license plate unless you are some poor loser who put fuck all money and made a shit load from it because "meme stock " that ended up him/her having enough money to buy a decent car.

I‚Äôm with you 100% bro city life is not it. I wanna have a house in the woods or on a lake when I‚Äôm older
Congratulations, where ya headed?
We should adopt the same minimum wage Sweden has.

It is failing, but it's not so simple where the stock market follows it down. Stocks represent the world's largest and most successful companies and many of them are doing very well while we circle the drain. Some equities, like shares of big tech companies, have also been acting like a value shelter.
Yee!
Don‚Äôt fight the trend
Based on how SPY closed green/held gains, we could see ATH tomorrow. Broke resistance at $442 and consolidated Friday. Just watch volume at open.

Countless photos on wsb of cars with meme tickers or apes license plates.  If you made 80k you retard why you blowing it away like some broke ass retard? Thats 80000 soldiers ready to work hard for more.

The goal everyone should have is to make PASSIVE INCOME from the hard earned capital you created by living and sacrificing for years. 

Investing 20k that turns in to 100k then buying "ma dream car" at 80k is the dumbest thing you can do.

You will always remain poor and have a job like this because as soon as you make a few extra cents, you spend it like a typical retail retard tryinh to impress people who don't care or gold diggers

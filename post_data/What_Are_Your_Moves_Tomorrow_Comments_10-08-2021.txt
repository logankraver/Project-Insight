What are some logical companies for Coinbase to try and acquire? Obviously they don't all have to be √ßrypto related, some normal companies could provide value to Coinbase.
well, if you get a black swan event that includes the USA reneiging on it's foreign debt, then sure as shit the market floors will be closed, the banks will be closed, the supermarket shelves will be empty &amp; looted, ammo will be sold out, and the national guard will desert to go back home .. the army might make it for a while - break up into warlords maybe .. then what.. ?

= this is why I mentioned goats as fiat =

Evergrande is an internal problem for the communist boardroom and their experts to deal with (and it's not so 'huge'.. it aint any black swan)  - they still have the people the equipment the production, split it up put other folk or other companies in charge of chunks, they can nationalise the whole shithouse with zero effort and keep building - if they want to - , they have been sorting this for a week now, they have very diffent powers to the US government's democratic status.

And anyway, the US would have to be literally suicidal to hold to the debt limit.. that's a "destroy the world" move .. and after all the shouting, totally nobody would EVER consider that.. it's a simple excuse for hot air, farting in each other's faces, and TV exposure.

By the way, for you retards I‚Äôll do you a favour. For the past 18months, bad jobs report meant bullish because the dip would get snapped up as the markets were being propped up. From now on, bad jobs report will mean increasingly bearish as we go on. Yes, it‚Äôs true that a bad report means tapering will be more gradual but the tapering isn‚Äôt likely to be that significantly extended

Its all fake bullshit for TV, the USA aint ever going to do anything else except raise the debt limit every time it needs to until yall go back to mad max and dump the dollar an start using goats as fiat.

Delete this before some nerd reports you and gets you banned.
Omg I read some of those links and it was completely obvious that these animals having a rapid puberty cycle and shorter life cycle have their puberty induced or triggered by something in their sleeping pattern. Some animals can only mate during certain times of the year or under certain conditions due to evolutionary induced mechanisms. It‚Äôs pretty obvious this is something unique to these mammals and of course there are going to be slight differences when their natural life cycles are tampered with. I wish I could eloborate more but I honestly don‚Äôt really know the details about these animals. Interesting stuff though

I would have to read the entire study. And just fyi while the major hormones have similar if not identical effects in small mammals and other mammals as they do in humans things can differ, and the differences grow larger as you go outside of the major hormones. Melatonin could have an unknown effect in these hamsters, but more likely there is a stress induced response causing the result due to some variable in the experiment. I can not think of a single way that melatonin could inhibit puberty in humans and there has been EXTENSIVE studies on it which is why it‚Äôs OVER THE COUNTER. Interesting study though send me the link

The best way to hedge against inflation is to buy equities of companies with low PE's and high ROC's. Value investing is back baby.
DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE ADVICE DOC? IT ONLY MADE THE HAMSTERS BALLS SHRINK TO RICE AND THE WOMEN STOP CYCLING.

we were working on these little, they‚Äôre called Siberian hamsters, these little hamsters, who in long days, because they are seasonally breeding animals, in long days, these Siberian hamsters have testicles, well, that at least for Siberian hamsters, are a pretty impressive size. If however, you inject those animals with melatonin, or you put them into short days, so you increase the amount of darkness and you decrease the amount of light, remembering, of course, that light inhibits melatonin, **their testicles shrink to the size of a grain of rice**‚Ä¶.. And it turns out in females of the same species, they leave estrous, they stop cycling. They don‚Äôt have menstrual cycles, they have estrous cycles. And there are powerful effects of melatonin on the reproductive axis. -Andrew Huberman, Department of Neurobiology, Stanford

You are incorrect about melatonin being a ‚Äúpuberty blocker‚Äù. You should not be giving medical advice as you are not qualified. While melatonin does have an antagonistic effect against dopamine it is not significant. Dopamine is mainly involved in mood and behavior as a neurotransmitter. Please stop giving quack internet advice
Cei my guy
Don‚Äôt listen to this guy about medical advice he‚Äôs obviously not a doctor lmfao. Yes while melatonin does have an antagonistic affect against dopamine it‚Äôs really not a big deal if it‚Äôs to help you sleep. It does not affect puberty. Dopamine is mainly responsible as a neurotransmitter and affects mood and behavior. That‚Äôs a basic summary for you

TLRY ? ü§î r/TLRY
The melatonin system is closely linked up with GABA inhibitory neurons in the hypothalamus. It effectively [keeps puberty from happening](https://impossible.co/blogs/health/melatonin-side-effects). So the melatonin rhythms of young children, pre-pubertal children, are not as phasic, right? They‚Äôre pretty constant. And that‚Äôs one of the reasons they don‚Äôt go into puberty.  -Andrew Huberman

Huberman has a whole podcast on sleep that's worth watching [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;ab_channel=AndrewHuberman)

Who smells there farts just cause
I don‚Äôt know you, but I have decided to trust you with 100$. Tell me what to do boss
Don't take melatonin. It lowers your dopamine. It's a puberty blocker. There's like a thousand reasons. I used to take it and then learned it's mechanism of action.
every night i get ready for bed, i lay down, take my melatonin or what have you, but I will myself to stay awake until pre-market opens

there's no reason for it. i can't sell options during PM. The direction of the market is meaningless, because that could easily change before the actual opening, but by God I haven't fallen asleep early on a trading night for over a year

"Two guys live in an insane asylum. And one night, one night they decide they don't like living in an asylum any more. They decide they're going to escape! So, like, they get up onto the roof, and there, just across this narrow gap, they see the rooftops of the town, stretching away in the moon light... stretching away to freedom. Now, the first guy, he jumps right across with no problem. But his friend, his friend did not dare make the leap. Y'see... Y'see, he's afraid of falling. So then, the first guy has an idea... He says 'Hey! I have my flashlight with me! I'll shine it across the gap between the buildings. You can walk along the beam and join me!' B-but the second guy just shakes his head. He suh-says... He says 'Wh-what do you think I am? Crazy? You'd turn it off when I was half way across!'"

We are getting closer every year to harnessing fusion. The initial fusion reactors/engines will be quite large and will be used to power cities and provide electricity in place of the current power plant. We will use some nuclear as well but obvious fusion is much better, safer, and cleaner than using fission

Honestly as someone a few years ago who was absolutely certain I never wanted kids and have them now. I'll tell you; no matter how much work, how tiring, how whiny, how naughty, how expensive, etc. One of the absolute favorite parts of my day every single day is walking into the house and my daughter yelling "Daddy" with a big ass smile on her face so fucking excited to see me. All that other shit is worth it for that moment alone, let alone all the other positive things.

What if the firms who sell SPY Puts, use those profits to buy shares of S&amp;P 500 companies and drive up the price of SPY? Infinite money glitch, and an ever increasing amount of free equity in massive companies. How many people in here have sold everything and bought SPY puts on the way out the last 2 months?

I bought 10/29 $450 Spy calls when Spy was 430 finally closed them today at $2.20

I just wanna spend $3-4k scalping something at open and then selling for a quick 10%

Scale in full retard if there's market momentum. I don't think the debt ceiling stuff is really a catalyst anymore.
I want this this happen so I can read the headlines.

I do, mainly tickers I've never seen and out of nowhere, tons of people are commenting about it, like... SDC, IRNT, TMC.. etc
There are good things like more affordable taxes and housing.  But some bad things include:

Abortion ban (depends on political views I guess, but most people are pro-choice), can't winterize their infrastructure so power outage risk, antivaxxer/antimasker stupidity being the norm, votes for a senator that abandons them in a crisis, Houston not built to resist flooding
All these people who have kids always say "iT's so reWarding." But they look miserable all the time. They're lying to themselves. They'd rather go back to being childless.
Tesla is the toxic ex that you keep fucking on the low, PLTR is the loyal girlfriend who makes you breakfast but is celibate

All the Medicare companies offer Supplements, Drug Plans, and Advantage plans. People either take Supp (which pays your 20% of Original Medicare, etc) + Drug, or they take Advantage because it includes drugs. I will say that Advantage is definitely gaining steam in the last few years because they offer more benefits and the premiums are lower. The older seniors are still on supplements, most of the newer 65 crowd coming in takes Advantage because it works like group insurance, which they are used to. So really UHC, Aetna, etc share the same model as CLOV, but they do it better because they are nationwide in almost every single state and county. CLOV as far as I know doesn't have any supplements or drug plans. So in sum, yes CLOV is very small, but does have the potential for some growth. But like I said before, honestly I'd be hoping they just get bought out and a bigger company comes in and buys the shares at a premium for everyone.
Oh my gourd!

The relationship of medicare advantage to medicare is sort of yin and yang tho right? So while UNH is competition its model is pretty much the opposite of CLOV. Can they also offer a medicare advantage plan? Its true they only have less than 1% market share but that is the thesis. Growth.

All of them in ccp
But yet you said china was selling them off to cause inflation? Except that‚Äôs not how it works, and anyone could be selling them off, and guess what? If people think it‚Äôs a good deal they will buy them. The inflation was caused by the money printing, not because of bonds lmfaoooo. Guess what China didn‚Äôt do? Print a bunch of money because they are responsible. You know why the FeD printed money? So they could sell at the top of an inflated market because they are retiring soon and Covid caught their plans off guard. Tell me, who is the bad guys again?

Yields move inverse to bond price, retards. I thought we've gone over this but it's like nobody gets it. Bonds selling off &gt; bonds cheaper &gt; yields higher and more attractive &gt; stocks sell off as people buy up cheap bonds &gt; bonds stabilize &gt; yields dip.

How slow does this need to be explained.
Spy on open. Today was our chance and we didn't close above 440

Tomorrow bears get their own gap down

It'll probably be good for bulls eod tomorrow

1. Almost all bond trading is institutional, even more so than stocks. The only bonds most boomers have is through their 401k. 

2. Bonds are being off loaded, which is why yields are going up.
Your username and this post fit so well together I‚Äôm almost impressed
Yields move inverse to bond price, retard. You think people rushing into bonds causes yield to go up? Tell me more about pyongyang university
Nah, bro. I'm in it for the long haul let's go üî•üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüí∞
I can get with this, but not right now
Supply chains will not be a concern. Look at LEVI. It announced earnings this week
Just wait and see reactions of the bulls at market opener on the eurostonxx and german index. If the bulls won there, the possibility for a green day on the spy is given
This gave me a stroke good job
That‚Äôs why u wipe with a piece of toilet paper

You think people buying bonds drives yields up? How would that even work? The fed giving out bonuses?
PTON. Like wtf kinda name is that. Commercials were cringe af. No business having a market cap like that.
Whatever lol.
I don‚Äôt shower to avoid this
Agreed. Supply chain issues are real, but quality management can navigate short term.

So rising yield bonds should only negatively affect growing non profiting companies the most since they are the ones borrowing money. SPY and Chasdaq should be fine since free cash flow for the biggest tech and other companies are crazy good

For the retards in the audience, bond yields are going up because the Chinese are selling bonds to destroy America with inflation after releasing a deadly virus forcing us to spend so they can conquer the world. That's how bonds work.

Because we are dealing with the aftereffects of shutting down just about every economy in the world, you dolt. Kicking the can down the road to a time where oil futures aren't at -$40/bbl, shipping isn't completely backed up because ports are closed, and people aren't about to lose their homes because they couldn't go back to work and the rent (which had been piling up for months now) is coming due. There's so much more that's *still* happening, which by definition should be already absolutely murdering economic growth (as measured in real GDP growth). They could pull the plug, but shit is going to get hairy because it's still too soon. You think we're ready to resume the recession from 2020, plus interest? What we're currently seeing isn't actually economic growth, it's an overextended expansion, as growth is more about production capacity, which is currently shrinking.

Studies have shown that the release of dopamine during gambling occurs in brain areas similar to those activated by taking drugs of abuse. In fact, similar to drugs, repeated exposure to gambling and uncertainty produces lasting changes in the human brain.
I'm a Medicare broker, so I sell all the plans that the companies offer to seniors. The big players are United Healthcare, Humana, Aetna, and Blue Cross Blue Shield/Anthem. For example, we don't even have any plans offered by Clover for seniors in the midwest. When I looked at their website, they only offer Medicare Advantage plans in 9 states, mostly in the poorest states in the south and southwest. And even in those states, they don't even have every county. So their market share is very very tiny. Not to say they couldn't grow eventually, but to bust through the big players who literally have billions in advertising, etc, that's going to be very hard to do. Honestly the best bet for them would be if they were bought out by a bigger company, then your shares would print.

WSB Autists. I realize this moment may not be the most convenient for a heart-to-heart, but I had to wait until the mods were otherwise occupied. Hm. There was a time they cared nothing for you Apes... When their only experience of an ape was when one was charging towards them at a zoo enclosure. When I plucked you and introduced you the market, I acted in the face of objections that you were mere children and of no practical use to anyone. I have learned to ignore such naysayers when quelling them was out of the question.  
   
Still, I am not one to squander my investments... and I remain confident you were worth far more than the initial...appraisal. That's why I must now extract from you some small repayment owed for your own survival. See SPY safely towards $455 dear apes.  I wish I could do more than keep an eye on you, but I have agreed to abide by certain... restrictions. Mmm. Well... Now... Listen carefully, apes.

Depends on your risk tolerance, just like everything else. Their technology won't be fielded for years, maybe even a decade. There's also a chance it straight up doesn't work out, or laws change and companies can't just launch shit into space anymore, etc... It's also pretty volatile because it's been mentioned here and other places a lot so it jumps around every few months. 

Personally, I got in around $8 and sold a couple months later at $13. I was planning on holding it longer but I'm pretty happy with that trade. If it goes below $10, I might get in again. The upside potential is *massive* if it actually works, but it's very, very, very risky.

Prediction: spy will dump and fill the gap early in morning til 7:30 AM then start going back up and turns green. So, if you have puts try to sell it at open before the rally to green, and if u want yolo buy 0dte otm calls and pray. I see this pattern to often but again just my 2 cents no financial advice

Drawing private property as your line against what counts as real communism is just as arbitrary as any of the other features they lack. They have money, a state, and social classes. Just because they don‚Äôt resemble Leninism doesn‚Äôt mean they count less or are capitalist.

Just like the USSR, their stated goal is the eventual realization of a communist utopia.
Already lost a bit of money on that shit. Luckily I dumped it pretty quick when I figured out how bad it was and minimized losses. Dogshit stock.

Do you think the Nazis were socialist because they had ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù in their name, too? 

It doesn‚Äôt matter what they call themselves, or even if they believe in the eventual transition to a classless, stateless society. 

As of now, they are a state capitalist economy, or what they call ‚Äúmarket socialist.‚Äù

They aren‚Äôt communist, because they allow for the existence of private property. 

You could argue that they were communist during the Maoist era, sure. But Deng Xiaoping reopened the country to foreign investment and market speculation in 1990, when he reopened the Shanghai Stock Exchange. It had been closed under Mao. 

They are state capitalist, or market socialist. Characterizing them as anything else is for historically illiterate fools, who are neck deep in Red Scare propaganda.

At least he can change the oil on your 87 Honda Civic
Yes. You're actually implying the opposite of how it works. TA is nonsense. It only works because it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. Therefore, it's only more likely to work on a stock in which the people using it will apply it. Stocks that are actively traded by large funds, boomers, day traders - so think things like SPY, QQQ, AAPL, DiS, MSFT.

China literally took babas ant group for lulz and gave a portion to the Enron version of China, who the CCP recently executed the CEO of.

Scared of China hacking them for calling them out, and they still want to buy and sell stuff in China.   No one cares about Russian manufacturing or selling in their markets

People acting like they're living out their Big Short fantasy. This was expected years ago. They're not nearly as levered as the unregulated synthetic mortgage bets were in 2007. Sure it's a bigger chunk of GDP, but there won't be investment bank collapses or fire sales.
I don‚Äôt want to get banned for a shitty joke.  I want to get banned for a really mean, over the line joke.  If the FANG stocks go down tomorrow, it‚Äôs likely that SPY will too.

Do your homework buddy. Communism is a utopian society where there is no state, no classes, no private property, and no money. It has never been attempted because it‚Äôs insane and retarded.

You sure? I‚Äôll try but any tips how do i keep communists there by going after me?

Communism means that private property does not exist. 

China allows for private property, although it is strictly regulated by the State. 

Therefore, they are state capitalist, and not communist. 

It‚Äôs really not that hard.

No problem. ETFs in general are just better for long term investing. They‚Äôre diversified for you and you can find some good ones for each industry or just do a total market ETF. Just watch out for those expense ratios (ex: SPY vs VOO. SPY has a higher expense ratio yet contains the same stocks as VOO).

For me, it's Moderna. The best vaccine. I even ask for extra booster doses and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige.

One time I asked for a Moderna booster and they gave me three. I said, "Wow, three for free!" and the nice friendly CVS worker laughed and said, "I'm going to call you 3-for-free!".

Now the staff greets me with "hey it's 3-for-free!" and ALWAYS give me three boosters. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local CVS, I go there at least 3 times a week for Moderna boosters, 1-2 times for Pfizer on the weekend, and maybe J&amp;J when I'm in a rush but want a great vaccine that is affordable, fast, and can match my daily vaccination needs.

Us Patriot fans try to forget the giants losses in the SB but they also forget that Brady and Co drove us down the field and put us ahead with around 2 mins to go in each of those game, as and objective football fan those are great games, we shouldn‚Äôt have gone 9-0 in the Sb‚Äôs settling for 6-3 should feel ok lol üòÇ
What‚Äôs their deal? Haven‚Äôt looked into this ticker.
Shit. Any suggestions
There was a shortage BEFORE this shit man‚Ä¶ This is not the cause lmao wtf

Elon has more self respect than to fuck Madonna
TLRY?
It will die a slow death. It will spike 10% every now and again and drop slowly the rest of the time, until it hits its real valuation which is about 2 potatoes.

Too many retail bagjolders with a handful of shares they see no point in cashing out.. But eventually they will.

As luck would have it, I just walked into a gamestop store today. Damn, felt like I was in blockbuster. They had a ps4 console to test out in the entrance.. Lol.. There was one employee who responded with "I don't know" to every single thing I asked about their games etc..

I don't understand why that thing isn't boarded up yet. Maybe they haven't told the guy there yet and payroll forgot to 0 his stubs or something..
Pics?
It's going to keep running for a bit. Maybe it trades sideways tomorrow, but his puts are big fukt unless something major happens.
How about TLRY ? Remember he was pumping Weed stocks at $60-70 in 2017-18. Then he changed his mind when the stocks went down.

Many people lost money following what he says. He recommended Baba at $250 then $220 then $200. Everyone lost.

I‚Äôm just gonna buy TLRY with you all!

I cannot wait until some smartass grad student does a correlation study between cup size and twitch streaming revenue, now that both data sets are publicly available.
I'll be guiding my friend through selling his first Put Option. I'm going to try my best to give him wise advice, but I'm a guy who hangs out on Wallstreetbets, so pity that poor bastard taking my advice.
So your argument is that changing things now for the better somehow accounts for the past? You're obviously one of the 40%, go $ROPE before you breed dumplings.

True. Conservatives have serious "news" shows like Hannity and Fox and Friends to pander to their audience. Comedy news shows appeal to liberal demographics which would be turned off by more serious news, while conservatives tend to be the opposite. It's all about marketing to your target demographic regardless of which end of the political you're pandering to. Lots of dumb people out there on both sides that just want to hear what they want to hear and circle jerk over it. Lots of money to be made appealing to those audiences too.

Finally make a decision between BP and XOM. I already have XOM, but BP seems to be making the stronger clean energy shift.

When the cost of lending goes up, it‚Äôs bad for growth stocks that rely on cheap access to credit.  It also makes treasury securities more valuable, which drives institutional investors away from riskier investments like stocks.  But it‚Äôs way the fuck more complicated than that and it‚Äôs just one piece of the puzzle.
If it took you a year to turn 36k into 72k, and then into 8k then yes -- you have wasted 1 year of your life doing this shit.

My option portfolio has gone from -80% to +500% to -80% again to +1000% to +200% to +500%.

And hopefully over time you learn what types of plays have higher odds of success and how to put the right amounts into those plays.

Yields on existing bonds go down when the market is bearish. Yields rising on *new* bonds (like the 10 year) gives investors an alternative to place money for a safe return. Tons of firms want 7% a year, so as treasury yields rise, proportionally more money will go into those bonds to reduce risk from equities.
You'll own nothing and you'll be happy: it means the bulls will loose everything on btfd strategy and the day they quit trading will be the happiest day in their life. That will be the time to buy.

Once or twice a year yes.
Yup happens both ways. When interest rates increase then the present value of future earnings is less, so certain high PE growth stocks are less attractive. Also when stocks are heavily sold, money tends to move into bonds which raises the bond prices lowering yields. Chicken and egg situation almost
Yeah, it's gotten better. It was god-awful between Feb and June/July though.
Quite contrary

You can‚Äôt call CCP a ‚Äúthreat‚Äù. That would imply america even stands a chance lmfao. The enemy of the free people of earth are bankers and Wall Street, they fear real leadership like Xi because he won‚Äôt tolerate their bullshit he will throw them in jail and throw away the key.

Good to start early, but wayyy too conservative imo with your amount of capital.

Try to find some undervalued companies in the tech sector and buy LEAPS on them. You'll make a shit-ton more than what you are now.

Read up on how to read balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements.

Or you can trade weeklies on SPY and QQQ, but you should probably start out slow.

monopolies enjoy monopoly-profits, thus eventually having the capital to expand vertically into new, upcoming industries. naturally, there are such things as bad monopolies, mainly those simply sitting on their cash (ignore those) instead of rapidly and aggressively scaling and expanding through new industries (seek these).

tech is broadly defined as doing more with less. doing more with less is often defined as having leverage (not the financial one, but the physics one). as such, because tech is often doing more with less, technology is a positive feedback loop‚Äîas long as its properly sought and iterated.

anyway, i‚Äôm long TQQQ shares (with some deep OTM LEAP puts for negative black swan events)

that‚Äôs why posting this problem to a forum of degenerate option traders is a good idea. Been there before üòÖ

What the fuck did you just fucking say about OTM FDs, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated bottom of my class in the Special Needs Division of the Navy Seals, and I've been bag holding from pump n' dumps on WSB since 2012, AND I have over 300 confirmed margin calls. I am trained in the 'tism and I'm the top retard in the entire United States armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another normie retail investor. I will wipe out my portfolio with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit about OTM FDs over the Internet? Think again, fuckface. As we speak I am contacting my wife's network of boyfriends across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your portfolio. Your fucking 401k is dead, kid. I can trade anywhere, anytime, and I can lose fat stacks over seven hundred ways, and that's just with TSLA FDs. Not only am I extensively trained in sniffing glue, but I have access to the entire crayon collection of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass boomer stocks off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit crayon diarrhea all over you, the likes of which would make even Jackson Pollock jealous, and you will drown in it. You're fucking done, kiddo.

I would say that the Anna Karenina principle applies here,

that there's a lot of reasons why a candidate is undesirable to employers,

meaning that there's probably one or more factors that is turning off HR, you just have to figure out what they are. It might be your resume, it might be your cover letter, it might be your interview, your OAs, etc.

I was also a math major, and I also struggled for a bit career-wise until I figured out how to play the HR game, which isn't taught in school unfortunately
It would be better if they were just dead then the market would be better off, all they do is waste our time

You do understand that ‚Äúlicense‚Äù is their livelihood that they spent 500k in tuition and a decade of brutal schooling to get right? Don‚Äôt blame them, blame the pharma companies and the useless bastards that are health insurance companies. Fucking leeches to society. If you paid your general physician a $100-200 monthly directly for you and your family to be covered year round for visits they would happily take you and just charge you the cost for medication. Some doctors in rural areas still do this. Unfortunately the middle men fuck over the doctors and the patients. Do you think those ridiculous 200k hospital bills for a surgery actually go to your surgeon? A total hip replacement reimburses the surgeon $1,350. The hospital bill would be closing in on $100,000. Hospital Administration,Health insurance and Pharma are all useless fucks for the most part

After a lifetime of Retail I have grown to despise small talk.  For example, I don't want to go out to eat with anyone because it involves talking about things I'm not interested in. I don't want to talk to anyone when I get home. I'm happier in my own thoughts or curating the things I engage with.  Just wanted to say that WSB is the closest thing that I have to a friend and I appreciate the time I spend with you.

OUT OF THE $ PUT LEAPS IN EWT (which is the Taiwan Equity ETF).  If any happens that market is gonna plummet for at least a few weeks. Plus like the US &amp; thanx to TSM they have also rallied hard for the past year.  I‚Äôll probably buy the them to March of next year around 10% out of the money.

Water is actually not wet; It makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the state of a non-liquid when a liquid adheres to, and/or permeates its substance while maintaining chemically distinct structures. So if we say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the object.
Like, I've been depressed long enough I could have fun with the game and honestly be mentally prepared to make my death amusing for everyone if I lose cause it's a stressful situation for everyone to begin with.

At first glance Squid Game might seem like it would be a no brainer to sign up for. There's no obvious downside, just a chance to win a lot of money. Makes you wish they would make Squid Game real.

Bro amen, but fuck this thread is so negative, there is a constant 3 people here to shit on it. I bought shares in at 596 with my whole portfolio, and a lot of other people did bc it got a lot of attention. So I think it‚Äôs solid close above 650 and we‚Äôre good. That short attack failed, then spam started once 650 was broke. So clearly just 650 is gonna hurt shorts and hedges. Ik with my price I can afford to wait, and surely many other people can. Good luck god bless all

There has been a ton of research and the long term effects are not a concern because we understand mechanistically how this works by studying biology and immunology. This is waay safer than live virus vaccines and the technology of this has been around for a decade.

I totally agree, even my 95yr old great grandfather sends her info about vaccinations. Her argument is that there isn‚Äôt enough research. Which is not wrong.

Long Term Bears what's your argument?  Millions of Boomers are retiring or have already retired,  The next few years will be crucial for there 401ks and Real Estate.  Many of which are now finally in a position to retire after playing catchup since 2009.  Do you really think the Fed won't step in to prevent a recession regardless of future debt or inflation? What do you think is more likely, the Fed overspending on QE or the Fed fucking an entire generation of retirees?

Eh. Probably best to avoid the simmer if you can. Also electric stoves would be best choice.

Bear or bull makes no difference to me, it's just clicking buttons, but it has been bear season for a month. You need to take profits on puts quickly imo. Getting to know how closing prices can help predict the momentum of the ticker is also helpful, specifically the moving averages. Watching how fast dips get scooped up is a little alarming in this market uncertainty so if I'm buying puts I'm usually buying them 90-120 days out and at least $10-15 ITM

Yields are up 30%. Feds will taper soon. Tech is down a measly 5% from ATH. There are tech companies that have been in business for 14 years, haven‚Äôt made a $ in profit, and are trading at a revenue multiple of 120. In a normal market a revenue multiple of 10 is on the higher side. The only other time we saw these revenue multiples was the 6 months before the dot com burst.

Small minded people think this way. "It's been doing this forever so it won't change." We are at a tipping point. There is much more at play than a simple cause and effect between two factors. We have the highest inflation we've seen since 2008 and in some measurements the early 90s. Rates will have to be raised and quick. You'll see the end result soon enough

There is not enough supply. But also no way to increase production. So price rises. But profit does not. This causes a squeeze. Look at the natural gas chart. Same thing happening to oil. The futures are all going to hell cause of the quick rise and it‚Äôs going to wipe out brokers. Some folks are gonna lose their ass.

Trueeeeeee
I just had one of the freakiest experiences of my life.

Recently I've been playing a lot of basketball because it's a fun way to get a good workout in. 

Typically, I like to go in the evenings because it tires me out, which causes me to sleep good as hell. Usually about 7PM is perfect, but as we get further into the year, it's been getting darker and darker each time I get to the courts (for context, they're outside). Doesn't really bother me because I live in a nice area and I think I can handle my own (mid-20's guy, bigger build).

As usual, once it hit 7PM, I left to go workout. When I got there, it's basically night. I'm the only one there. An important thing to note is that there are a few lamp posts nearby, which is cool, but nothing fully illuminating the courts. There's a business a few hundred few hundred feet to the right of them, which closes around 7PM or 7:30PM, depending on how busy they are.

About 10 minutes into playing, I get this weird feeling that somebody's watching me. I'm not a paranoid person and I don't believe in anything supernatural, so I try to write it off, but I can't. I lower the volume of the podcast I'm listening to and take one earphone out, just in case.

Sure as shit, two minutes later, I turn around to see a shadowy figure peeking it's upper half of it's body out from behind a tree. 

You're probably thinking that this isn't very odd because everyone has those "I swear I saw something!" moments. This was different though. I watched this thing slowly disappear behind a tree. Took maybe three or four seconds at least. Note: I stood totally still, so it wasn't how the light was interacting with things and there was zero wind.

I played for about ten more minutes until the business next to me shut up shop for the night and the last guy left. 

I scoped out the area that I saw the "thing" from, but from a distance. I saw nothing (I didn't get closer because, if it were a person, I didn't want to get mugged.) And for context, the tree it popped out behind from was only clustered together with another tree and a few bushes.

The absolute wildest bit is that I saw it a few times and each time, it did the same thing. 

Figure was about 5-6 feet tall, totally black, outline of a person. No distinguishing features.

inb4 fuck you bot. Not fiction. And yes, it's shittily written - who cares? I'm just trying to share a creepy experience I had.
At some point all identities will be revealed and the Cancel Army will come to ruin everybody‚Äôs life.

The idea of nuclear power began in the 1930s, when physicist Enrico Fermi first showed that neutrons could split atoms, it wasn‚Äôt until a century later that the first mass-producible portable ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù nuclear power units were made on earth, and that is when the nuclear revolution truly started.

I won‚Äôt use any names, but I‚Äôve noticed some folks here have some rather negative things to say about certain stocks and even the economic future of our civilization.

But is that really a dump? Do we really expect prices to be constant? If they were +1% then moved to +0.84% would we call that a dump? I do agree that the speed was significant, but this becomes a philosophical question on what is considered a dump.

Ok, uncertainty is high. All camps are feeling perhaps a little shook. As I have always said, in times like this we must remember the words. 

Bulls. Bears. *Friends*, please join me in the Litany of Gains. 


*I must not fear.*

*Fear is the gains-killer.*

*Fear is the little-dip that brings total obliteration.*

*I will face my fear.*

*I will permit it to pass over me and through me.*

*And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.*

10x 450c 11/19 bought at close. small entry while we're still testing waters.  I think maybe a little dip at open, will hold as long as spy holds above 436. break below 436 = cut my losses, otherwise will hold and wait for upside reversal, take any gains before spy takes it's lunch/mid day nap
100 days, 300 days, you picked 75 to try and make a biased point.  What is the 180 day return?  Yearly?  Last 2 days?  All up?
you weren't lying. +1.6% is very nice indeed
Max pain is Spy 434 tomorrow
Predicted futures would go red at 8:15 and they dumped and went red at 8:16
  
I apologize for the timing inaccuracy I will work on it
What's a good stonk to buy at open? What are the vapors telling you?
It seems you are the one that doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù. Tonight‚Äôs vote meant nothing which is why we aren‚Äôt mooning in futures. December will be the final deadline, that is the time it will be solved for a much longer duration that 2 months and that‚Äôs when the market will be effected in a more substantial way in either direction.

So the SPY short volume was back to levels it was in August, around 70% on Fintel. This isn't actually shorts, it has something to do with how the market makers sell to retail and then run it through a dark pool or some shit, but this says they worked to put the brakes on today. 

When GEX was low the other day it run up, but from here I think we crawl to 460

CLOV opened at $7.40 and closed at $7.40 today. Highs and lows of $7.57 and $7.30. 

What are the odds of closing at EXACTLY the same price? Coincidence or manipulated?

Looking at the options chain the largest open interest by far is at $7.50 and there's a decent amount of open options up to $10 with a bit of a gap at $9.50.

According to some guy on yahoo finance it says on Fintel that CLOV is now so shorted it's at 3.5 days to cover.

As someone who bought puts at 454 and made 50-300% gains from them let me tell you bears that this market will literally keep going up because it‚Äôs easy to just squeeze bears. It‚Äôs literally going up just to fuck you, you can‚Äôt win with long puts. I see where some of y‚Äôall are coming from trust me bulls aren‚Äôt as stupid as you think. We just realize the market is going to keep going up just to fuck you because your lost money will take the market higher. It‚Äôs not worth it to even try the powers that be will just keep harvesting bear blood until and actual decent sized rate hike happens next year. Until then it‚Äôs just going to be a bull party, we couldn‚Äôt even get the 424 gap never the less the 405 everyone expected. That‚Äôs scary if you‚Äôre a bear man

Nahh. My generation was quitting their jobs to be professional poker players
For a few reasons. When not baking it‚Äôs not really important, but by allowing the oven to preheat what you are cooking will be heated evenly from all sides. If not preheated certain parts of the item may be overcooked while others are undercooked. 

In baking it‚Äôs very important. Baking involves a chemical reaction. You need the proper heat for the proper time to get a proper product. The oven needs to be both the right temperature from the start of the bake through the end, *and* everything needs to be heated evenly.

Edit: like if you‚Äôre reheating a slice of pizza just throw that shit in and turn it on and wait you‚Äôre good
That was me, sorry

I guess I take issue when it is constantly forced into conversations about being an issue.  Like I said maybe that makes me right wing.  As an investor in Tesla, diversity and inclusion is not my main concern with the company.

I also have issue with bs studies regarding the benefit of diversity and inclusion initiatives being quoted as truth.  And the lack of acknowledgment that those same initiatives can do real harm to certain populations (e.g. affirmative action lawsuit versus Harvard).

I believe in meritocracy. The better qualified candidate should get the job, award, bonus, etc IMO.  I don‚Äôt want to be forced as an employer to hire a less qualified candidate because of gender, sexuality, or race.

Dude, absolutely insane. 

The market crashing and just the knowledge that COVID was coming for like, 3 fucking weeks before lockdowns in the US were even being discussed. 

I remember I met up with a friend at Grimm Brewery in Brooklyn to discuss options plays for the ongoing crash. 

At one point we were discussing how it was almost certainly going to be here within a week if it wasn‚Äôt already, stopped and looked around at how many people were in the brewery, which was absolutely fucking packed.

Wild times. Futures limiting down. Driving to work every morning blasting My Sharona (the official Coronavirus theme song) watching pre-market crash. Circuit breakers two times a day. Fuck. Only a year and a half ago and I get nostalgic
Seeing so many confident retards gives me confidence that Im right buying these puts
Is it? I saw 11.50
I never said $12-15 I said it‚Äôs a great stock regardless of earning. It‚Äôs $1000 stock in the future
If SPY makes 450, yeah, I'll have a ten bagger. I'm not very confident of that, though. I'm thinking maybe 443-444. Or maybe 432.
You ever walk your dog and see a guy in his apartment clapping cheeks with his windows open?
Um, most people.  Best selling truck in the country is the f150, simple transition to electric and boom, number 1 selling ev truck in America.

I got that beat - my QQQ 10/8 352.5 s lost 91% of their value today.  Praying for Jpow to have a crisis of conscious tomorrow and unplug the printer and tell the world inflation is not transitory.  also, I'm dumb.
No way to know until you sell it, otherwise you are just guessing
It was 10.79 yesterday
Serves them right it should have been -99% fucking racist scum
Growth is not eternal. Tesla will hit that wall sooner or later. And the competition is increasing.
Bought puts when TSLA hit $800, got a semi decent feeling bout them
Shoulda bought it
Honestly I disagree. I think Powell really wants a reason to delay taper and the only way he could now justify a delay in the context of the insane inflation we‚Äôve had would be the jobs angle.
I just took a totally clean shit which means spy 2% tomorrow.

Oh
Because if recipes are designed for a preheated oven then items can be baked continuously by swapping out of the continuously hot oven whereas if recipes were calculated for an oven that starts cold and heats up throughout the baking process then each item would need time for the oven to cool and heat up again

If you're just cooking for yourself and don't need to do multiple things in a row, then there is a level of baking experience and knowledge or just a level of education on chemistry or whatever where you can recalculate recipes on the fly for an oven going from cold to hot. In this case God accepts the patience it took you to develop the skill and lets you have a little less patience for the oven
We don‚Äôt have the technology to figure out how many extra minutes would be needed as the temp rises
At the meeting it was announced that they‚Äôll be moving to Austin, Texas. I‚Äôm sure shareholders will love this, tomorrow it‚Äôll hold 800.
Same reason you don‚Äôt just buy puts. Gotta ease into em

Rip to the 20,000 and 10,000 BABA OCT15 145/140 Puts. They lost 75% of their value in a single day.
Guess what I'm saying is, it would have to be pretty bad. I think they wanted to announce taper at last meeting, but since dipshits got caught trading and selling the top they had to ease into it. 

Anyhow, regardless of taper, jobs report, Inflation , 460 EOY calls are gonna print!!!
Oof

It‚Äôs so annoying honestly I‚Äôm livid. I work hard for what I have it literally feels like whoever it was spit in my face and slapped my mom
Oh, everything tells me we should be down tomorrow  but I also know that we can be flat or up for no fucking reason.
Unfortunately that's not what happens.

good employemnt report - bullish for 10 year - bearish for tech. my fb and pypl puts were green by eod. they are like 2 dollars away from being itm.

10 year is at highest rate so far this month (today) and if that jobs report is good - blood bath tomorrow.

my puts at eod are up 65%
Did Cathie Wood say this?  It sounds like her line of reasoning.
chinas either deadcat bouncing or rebounding.
I realized one thing. I am going to buy 150 dollars 3 months apart if that shit dips to 110. Which is good way to realize gain
This happened to me once so I shot up the book club
&gt;QQQ to drop $11

yeah sure why not, shed another 3% after taking a 8% hit and bottoming out
Once a üåàüêª, will always be üåàüêª

Bulls so desperate they watching futures lmao
come on you POS politicians PAAAAAAHMMMP EEET what do you think we give you all those taxdollars for.
This is what I mean. I can be boring and tell people I like poop in and around my genitals, or I can get creative with it and incorporate sounding and finely ground coprolite mixed with exotic animal dung injected slowly into my expanding member via the urethra, only to jerk off while it slowly gets dickshat into my mouth as I'm (naturally) lying on my back with my feet behind my head.
Bottom is in for sure
futes mooning again because i got puts today

Being at 37% negative on a 2023-2024 leaps clearly shows how fucked up that stock is...

Good luck for the future.

I know the age group of the sub is pretty skewed towards early 20s nowadays but for fuckin real this debt shit happens every few years and results in Congress using it for political rhetoric fodder for a few weeks then just goes ‚Äúoh yeah we‚Äôre the United States lol‚Äù and just kicks the can down the road

https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL31967.html

&gt; Federal debt reached its limit on December 31, 2012. Extraordinary measures were again used until February 4, 2013, when H.R. 325, which suspended the debt limit until May 19, 2013, was signed into law (P.L. 113-3). When that suspension expired, the debt limit was set at $16,699 billion and extraordinary measures were reemployed. On October 16, 2013‚Äîthe night before Treasury‚Äôs borrowing capacity was estimated to be exhausted‚ÄîCongress passed and the President signed a continuing resolution (H.R. 2775; P.L. 113-46) that included a suspension of the debt limit through February 7, 2014.

It‚Äôs a farce

Imagine not being able to sell drugs profitably? Damn, TLRY making cartels look like geniuses
The bear argument for Tesla seems to be that the stock price is too high lol. All that tells me is that bears are having a tough time putting $790 dollars together lol. Does that sound like a bank account you want?
Affrm is very volatile. Shit sinks to 20% or raises 20% i would be happy as long as i sold at profit than holding it

I've not had a day off since Christmas and I rarely get 8 hours of sleep a day - will I live til 60?
Yeah I even had a call yesterday morning and sold way too early when it leveled out and dropped for bit. If I would have held it would have been a 5 bagger
What's your point? It was the only thing keeping SPY bearish for the past week. If it passes it's back to SPY only goes up
Yea that‚Äôs why I bought
Let's be realistic here, SPY 800.85
I would TSLAs are ugly imo

I can see BABA breaking past 160 tomorrow.

My thesis is long term, don't care. Unless a stupid squeeze occurs over the next few days (unlikely) I will not be selling most of this position.
Imagine wearing jeans over Lululemon leggings

Thanks bro!
my gf put her so cal condo on the market two weeks ago. she received 1 cash offer at 3% less than her asking price and 1 offer at her asking price which she accepted.  it's okay, we're happy, but it's nothing reaaaally crazy.

hey bb! i bought some 1dte puts before close. they were 65% at close. 438p 10/8

futures dont matter. nothing matters until the nonfarm payroll tomorrow. if that is good - 10 yr will climb - tech will dump - it will bleed into spy.

did you paper hand today? i held all my puts and fb &amp; pypl turned green for me.

Better ask WSB instead of Google
They're both about as bad imo. It's content designed to keep people emotionally worked up for no reason other than they will keep watching if they believe the narrative that something is at stake. The way see it, there is always someone selling people doom and gloom, always has been, and so far the big wheel has kept turning anyway. Why pick sides with these fools and waste energy on it?

Bears literally can‚Äôt win this market is too bullish to stop tbh we will literally pump until the exact last second possible. Bad job reports are bullish and good job reports are bullish.

I hate California and was already suspicious of Elon doing so much business there. When I grew up and learned as an adult that Maine is the only state in America that respects Constitutional rights, I found him even more suspicious for how he does zero business with Maine and I can't buy a Tesla because the nearest place to buy one or get it serviced is in fuckhole bullshit Massachusetts, one of the most anti-humanity anti-Constitution states in the Union. And now, when he finally leaves California, it's for the fucking capital of the global oil oligarchy, supposedly his greatest enemies? But he still hasn't finished getting around to the promise to expand into Maine, so as far as I can tell he just stole a 0 interest loan from me with my Cybertruck reservation while never intending to actually let anyone in my state own one? He has time to move his whole company into the global capital of the oil oligarchy before he has time to expand it into all 50 states or even all 48 contiguous? Completely eliminates any tiny bit of faith in him that I had hanging by a thread before.
It's better than watching Tucker.

The logical thing to do would be to buy SPY puts right? However, usually the graph goes up when I buy PUTs. I haven't learned my lesson. What should I do guys?

I‚Äôm welcoming anyone in the Chip sector, but yeah especially AMD and QCOM.

Where did that SNDL jump come from?
What‚Äôs the number on that?
Lmao action action, attention attention, appreciate the help with the momentum!
Having said all of that, if they pass the debt ceiling bill (most likely will happen) it's going to be a tailwind for the market and SPY might even retest 450 since there isn't a huge amount of historically established resistance between here and there... your only hope if the market rallies on that is that MMs will try to suppress the prices to avoid a gamma event into end of the week contracts, but they may let it run in that case to keep powder dry for OpEx. 

That concern about contracts and the existing couple of days of growth are why I didn't buy calls even though I'm pretty confident that alleviating the debt ceiling issue will rally the market... but contract expiry and rising bond yield might create a potential sell event.
Never. 

She‚Äôll leave you for someone who isn‚Äôt a üåàüêª.

Yup. Used to be heavier. Current version is metal in the front, plastic in the back to allow contactless payment feature to work. But it used to be metal both sides

CLNE went up like 50 cents today. It will also almost certainly go up a bit more when infrastructure bill finally gets passed. They continue to form new business deals. So it really depends when your expiry date is and what the strike is.

Imagine being able to increase the limit on your own credit card.
It can be cool depending on what kind of case you end up on. I served on a jury for a medical malpractice suit once, and it was interesting.
I also was in the pool for a murder case once, and when they did their interview in the courtroom, the prosecutor asked if I had ever been convicted of any crime. I answered yes.

She: and how do you feel about the police and our courts?
Me: Let me put it this way... I've never been convicted of any crime I didn't commit.

She and the defense attorney looked at each other, she looked at the judge, and said "Your honor, the state would like to dismiss this juror."

The concept of "sell the news" or "priced in" has to do with things that are generally trending a stock in a certain direction and where the realization of that thing kills the directionality of the rumor. 

This is why earnings aren't universally fire sales. Sometimes the news alleviates a concern rather than realizes a rumor.

This is an "alleviates a concern" kind of thing. Now, tomorrow may still go down, but I would not be attributing that to success of passing the debt ceiling bill being a "sell the news"/"priced in" kind of event, since the effect from the debt ceiling uncertainty was suppression of the market... the "sell the news" event has already happened.

Now if they fail to pass the bill, then we're definitely going down.
Can‚Äôt wait to go all in on calls. Just not yet
an economy of 1.3 billion people is never dead it‚Äôs just sleeping
‚úÖ
I meant instead of getting that 70 cent stock. Go for TLRY as they were $77 in feb and now less than 1/7 of that.
What's stupid is that we have a debt ceiling when no one else does

But you can only fly in the sun
Tomorrow seems important. Debt ceiling resolved and jobs report right as SPY is fighting to get through some big resistance points at 441 and 444. If we get through those I‚Äôll be feeling pretty damn bullish. If we drop tomorrow though or if we get rejected hard at ~444.50 again, I‚Äôm guessing we revisit 430 at least.
That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ retar‚Ä¶..

Just a little so I can get rid of these $438 0-dte puts and buy calls before SPY makes a new ATH
TLRY is better tho.

Yes range is a problem, but as battery technology improves this should be a possibility right?
Sad that dude asking if he should get a hooker deleted the comment

Don't see how the low jobs number = good for tech bul holds given that JPow will announce a Taper on November barring a catastrophic miss.

I am bullish on his lack of announcements actually lol. He didn‚Äôt make any lofty promises that he has become known for.
Good jobs report = quicker taper.  Pray for bad #‚Äôs(hint: Adp indicated on Wednesday they would be good)
I did jury duty once. It's crazy because I have multiple felony convictions for drug trafficking when I was young. Didn't even know I could still be on a jury. I checked the felony box on the thing in the mail, but to top it off I ended up being foreman, I guess since I had so much courtroom experience.
I have no positions in TSLA but watching it go up brings me great joy, knowing that shorts like Burry are getting destroyed
Depends on if the loan sharks he owes money to are at his house right now

He told Remy that SPY will go down but SPY went up.

u/cashflow had a Red Day again.
SNDL pumping means theyll be diluting their stock again to fund their new acquisition. Lol
TLRY is the very best stock you will ever lay your hands upon

So true
A corporation has a fiduciary obligation to produce as much profit for share holders as possible. 

Doesn't a diversity quota violate this fiduciary duty. Isn't a meritocracy in line with the duty of the corporation to benefit the shareholder ?

probably just a hedge against their calls.

I think we'll head north some more in order to fill the bear gap @443 [9/28], get rejected by the 50 day MA and close at around 435. 

Then Monday we gap down and find support at 425. From there, maybe test the 200ma later in the week?

Not financial advice, but I plan on opening 10/12 443Ps once we're ATM.

Goddamnit I made this joke earlier and everyone acted like it wasn‚Äôt funny.
Based on the Austin news? Was thinking it‚Äôd fly upward because Texas is way cheaper than Cali
My 450c‚Äôs dropped hard today. Couldn‚Äôt sell this morning when I was up 200% and now am only up like 20% on these
Only if it‚Äôs at 799-805
I'm up 13% this week, should be up over 5,000% if I only held my calls and puts for 30 mins longer each day, funny how that works
Tesla is just at the beginning of its growth stage. Remind me in 10 years when its the Apple of cars and energy. Remember all the Android fanboys who hated on iPhone? Lol
not a chance
I said I wanted it to work so you have more to throw at a dumber play, not that you should buy mutual funds or some shit.

That shit has been on a downtrend for a while.

This, despite the fact that it would be one of the biggest benefactors of the Biden infrastructure bill. Makes no sense. Good long term, may be more downward movement.
Doesn‚Äôt matter, just don‚Äôt buy any 10/8 puts.
TSLA energy sector is gonna explode with growth when the competition starts converting to electric vehicles ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏èüîãüîã. Not to mention when everyone needs to charge their Tesla sex bots, then things will really get erect.

Holy SNDL. What news???

Actually Tesla probably would've paid like $24 in taxes on 172mil, this guy will have to pay 100mil in income tax, so it's a win lol
Hard times
It's true, I'm the dead bear with ashes for bones.
Sounds data driven
\~18 out of 21 of my stocks are green today. Unfortunately the other 3 account for 75% of my portfolio and I'm down for the day, just like every day before this.
You watched TSLA reject 800 not once, but *twice* this week, and you decided to make that play? I actually hope it works out for you so you can burn a bigger amount on a worse play. The batman on the weekly chart is watching you throw your money away.

Reading "its all priced in" over and over is a great reminder that 1 black swan will tank this bih.
Yeah, short pressure is huge at this point, but this company looks like it is actually a scam, not a good guy getting bullied.
I make $300,000 a year. I work 12-14 hours a day, 7 days a week, in tech sales. I'm ready to rather kill myself or quit and go work on a vineyard in Napa Valley. Real talk.

Money means nothing if it forfeits your life.
Is it frowned upon to use all your PTO (2 weeks) and then quit right when you come back?
kinda hard to say. probably pump
Elon‚Äôs dad had a baby with Elon‚Äôs sister, so TSLA $900 tomorrow.

working on the ban bet thing, it's gonna be cool af. I'm gonna make it so to start we can only bet on tickers in the system. "x to y price by z or ban" is kinda how it's gonna work, except you'll have to use a certain format at first. After it's working and I create a wiki page to display active ban bets I'll work on getting it to use more natural prompting to create a ban bet.
It goes back to 111
Hit or miss I think.
California's exit would mean we refocus efforts on the productive states.

The GDP would increase in proportion and New York likely would become our new focal point as a nation.

If Bob took his apples and left, Jim and Nancy would pick more apples to fill the basket. The addition was to help you understand each member's part in the apple gathering. It wasn't the conclusion itself, genius.

Doesn't matter how much you make anymore.  Working 50-60 hours a week isn't a good life.

It's nice money though, if you play your cards right it can lead to a good life.
can we say that word now?!

Yes
At open. If you buy them 30 seconds after open, you‚Äôve already lost.
Depends where you live. NYC, Seattle, SF, DC, Boston you are like average tech/banker at 25 and still not going to be able to save tons after rent and such if you like to enjoy yourself. Still doing well, but not 2500 sqft home good.

If you are in Memphis, TN, Minneapolis, or FL, yea you are 4 bedroom house good.

Alcanna aquisition.
That dude who sued Tesla probably cost California billions in tax revenue.....good for that dude who hustled up on some bullshit but he probably fucked over everyone else.
Eventually, someone will have to do something about whatever happens because of what has happened. Mark that shit down.

I was thinking about what would happen if they just strategically positioned a few hundred million unarmed civilians all across our borders and had them all try to cross at once.

You have 10 apples total. Suddenly, Bob takes his 5 apples and leaves. Now you have 5 apples total. Just because Jim and Nancy have 5 apples doesn't make up the other 5 that Bob took you dumb piece of shit, LMAO.

They wouldn't need NY. Florida and Georgia would also be enough. In fact, Pick 2 or 3 Southeastern States (excluding SC and AL) alongside Texas and you make up for California.

Supply chain issue is real - Elon
I was told by Tesla bulls that Tesla has no supply chain shortages. Especially chips.

Elon in the shareholders meeting right now said they‚Äôve had issues with this for the last year.
Is that like a cost cutting measure?
Sears has some good sales right now
Free money = dick?

Elon did a really nice In Memoriam for Joe Rogan. Touching. I know they went way back.
now they tell us about the side effects.. motherfukers!
Hope you retards are making bank üëå
Doubt it. I'm holding a team of calls that're down 75%. 445 tomorrow would mean they would be green. I'm not allowed to see green.
If I had 200mg of Adderall each day I'd only sleep 2 or 3 hours each day too.
I think Elon needs to take some CEO presentation lessons from Tim Apple.
What did Elon do now I don‚Äôt want to google that fuck
I hope BABA and company go back up fast soon, so I can sell some and buy some American cheapies like CHWY and GOLD and LUV

Counter-argument is McConnel is getting roasted by his constituents (e.g. business. See: Chamber of Commerce abandoning GOP). He might be done with the brinkmanship. 

Typically it's 10 minutes before the deadline one way or another though. The problem with reconciliation is there might not be time, as it requires a "voteathon" open to GOP destroyers like Roy and Cruz. This might be McConnel saving face early vs. caving last minute.
The forecast for payrolls is like 3x what the FED said they would need to see to begin tapering.

Yeah, the poster doesn't know what the debt is and that most of it is the bond market. They're also not taking the time add up the spending and balance against tax receipts, nor are they accounting for the debt that the rest of the world owes us. If they were, they'd realize three things:

1. The debt will always expand over time, as we are an inflationary growth economy.
2. This is not really a bad thing because the bond market and the economic interdependence we have with other countries helps spur economic growth.
3. The expansion of the debt really tracks to the two tax cuts for the upper class and businesses which radically reduced tax receipts, barring the spending on COVID which was necessary and will be offset by economic expansion and through the buffering of the impact of the pandemic on the economy. In other words, most of the programs people take issue with actually grow the economy and multi-cyclically return their costs back to the government, but tax cuts for the upper classes basically reduce the receipts and contribute to the deficit problem.

There is a deficit problem, but trying to crush the debt is not a solution, nor is the proposed solution "printing money."
I concur. Make the Dems OWN that shit, as well as their $3.5T spending plan.
How do you know? I hope you‚Äôre right
Wouldn't minorities be overrepresented if they exceed percentage population?

2 min per 500 is a pretty good pace that most decently in shape people should pass.

If you sprint out the last 500 or maybe sprint 750-1000, 7:30 or below is still pretty good for a first time in shape person.

Best tip I learned is keep the arms straight when you go into the row, use legs until you are at around the mid thigh then use upper body. 

Make sure to breathe out on the row and in on the wind up.

Little selling tomorrow is going to spook sellers quick. Still on the downtrend, gap to fill to 434. I say we dump hard in morning until 435. Slowly kiss 434, hover there remaining of day. I have spoken!
Aapl shares. Won‚Äôt make you rich, but hookers and cocaine are on the table
So why we buying it‚Äôs stock ?

Model 2 would be the only Tesla I'd be able to afford, hopefully it's a slightly smaller Cyber Truck
Teach me, shifu.
I bought back in today. Think I'll slide a little SQQQ side bet in after this martini. Benefits of being an alcoholic gambler. Every play is smooth as shit until the next morning.
Why I am watching this üí©
Yep. I want to know if I'm right or wrong tomorrow on the pullback. I might forget.

XLNX calls for next week, a lot of them. We'll see how it goes.
Yup‚Ä¶
I do 10-20% of my calls. If I'm SUPER worried I do 30% hedge which is nuts and usually just caps profits.
They‚Äôve never had anything chipotle related on their menu

Hope so. Bought puts right before close
u/Spiritual_Extreme_81 u/tallpaulpaultall Jokes on you 66,310 people bought $450C 10/15 today and the OI is 221,715. SPY held its gains today and is ready for the next leg up. Pelosi bought these calls on Sept. 22nd and has held them the entire time despite being down millions. Why inverse Pelosi when her YTD return beats the S&amp;P by 50%+? Do you want to make money or be retarded and buy puts on an upwards trend?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Fed sells their stocks mid-sept. and SPY dips down all the way to $427.
2. Inversing Pelosi is the most retarded thing I have ever heard.
3. It was only public knowledge 10/4 that the Chamber is MIA over the weekend and potentially next week and Biden is pushing for the debt ceiling to be completed by tomorrow. This happens to be in favor RANDOMLY of the 10/15 calls
4. It's ATH or Financial Recession here, and a financial recession is impossible since Pelosi won't let her 50+ million in calls expire worthlessly.

I'll be posting my gain porn, I'll catch you guys behind Wendy's. Maybe I can buy you a 4 for 4 if you're lucky.

Well RKLB what a piece of shit.  The moment they go up they sell shares.  Why would anyone give them money.

What's your cost on the shares? Consider selling otm CCs until you make your money back. (I haven't looked at the options on TLRY, but this may work out for you).

Nothing. It is foolproof.
Tomorrow might be different. HSI isn't prone to ripping 3% a day and the FTSE Asia 50 has an 8% allocation to BABA. It's a 3x inverse.

I'm not long YANG but I did buy calls today at the bottom to play the upswing.
Well my entire long position in RKLB is fucked... Right when I was having an amazing week of trading too. Thankfully I sold some of my calls but wish I had gotten out completely, I knew of the PIPE just not when... Yikes.
Um, yikes sweaty. You need to pay more taxes. #eattherich üíÖ

After that insane bull run, even the cockiest bulls have to realize that we‚Äôre in for some pullback tomorrow.
Do you need to be a corporate slave to get said things?
people that bought baba shares on the way down most be happy as hell, munger coming to save your bagholding asses

What possible risk is there for holding TQQQ long term?
I don't think it's gonna happen. I think the R's want to force the D's to do it on their own, so the democrats can take all the blame. It's gonna have to be done through reconciliation, and the D's have said the infrastructure bill is going nowhere before the debt ceiling gets done.

The debt ceiling will be raised between 11:50 and midnight on 10/18.

Depends if you think the taper is priced in or not. People don't know even though they pretend they do.

let me stop you right there
It really do
People look for their bias in things. You're right and good jobs numbers are a greater positive economic indicator than the fear over tapering.... Personally, I think tapering might generate some red days, but in the grand scheme is going to be a nothingburger, just like it was in the mid-2010s.
Imagine being dumb enough to think tomorrow will be green
Whose leg do i need to hump to get a flair up in this MF‚Ä¶.

just a thought, many of you think that good non farm payroll numbers = faster taper = spy going down = markets having a pullback/correction. but last month with shitty august non farm payroll numbers, we only started going down from there (all downhill after 9/3). maybe with good job numbers, market will react positively? i dunno, just a passing thought.

The interest payments on existing debt and pre-obligated, long-term entitlement programs is 110% of net tax receipts.  That is, we are running a deficit even if we didn't pay a dime for infrastructure, unemployment, ACA, military, state department funding, Department of Interior, etc.  (If one looks at 2020, government spending, including unemployment and the like, was 192% of net tax receipts. )  We are way beyond the tipping point.  Not just this year, but long-term, the US is insolvent if not for massive printing at an accelerating pace, or absolutely gutting most all governmental programs.  Raising the tax rate cannot fill that gap.  So we will keep piling debt and it will require a rapidly accelerating printer to stay solvent.  We are in a runaway budgetary position.  51 of 52 past historical examples ended in hyperinflation.  The 52nd is Japan, who has a GDP still below 1994 levels and the Nikkei is still significantly below 1990 levels.

It pulled back a buck as people took profit. I expect overnight and tomorrow morning to go pretty much the same as it has been for a few days, then trade sideways until something actually gets done about the debt ceiling. So far, it's just a lot of talk, and some senators are saying McConnel's proposal may not make it through the Senate, forcing the Dems to push it through without a single Republican vote. And that's actually just the way the Republicans want it.
Do you think it keeps going tomorrow?

You do realize that vampires aren't real. Unless you Count Dracula.
200 possible but could be tough. I have some calls that are that short-term and high-striked too; I will try to add money gained elsewhere to roll into more realizable targets. 185 is my modest expectation for BABA by EOY, hoping for more of course

If it can‚Äôt hold 440 on good news, we‚Äôre in for more trouble. We‚Äôre still in a downward trend, lower highs and higher lows.

I am buying more TSLA tonight and tomorrow. Barron just posted this:

Why Tesla Shares Are Rising  
3:11 pm ET October 7, 2021 (Benzinga) Print  
Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares are trading higher ahead of the company's annual shareholder meeting, which is set to begin at 5:30 EDT.   
Following the presentation, Tesla will take questions from investors through the website. According to Electrek, here are some of the top questions that were asked on the company's Q&amp;A page:  
Does Tesla plan to offer any dividends to its shareholders in next 2 years?  
With $TSLA stock price back into the $700-800 range, and likely heading higher. Would you consider another split to allow retail investors to continue adding shares at a decent, per share, price?  
Is there any guidance on when Cybertruck production will begin and at what rate the ramp up will happen?  
Are we going to see 4680 battery cell this year in Texas? If not what part of production is holding up?
If spy can just repeat Wednesday‚Äôs events tmrw then I will be a very happy camper
üí©üí©üí©
Wtf.  You all see the SPY spike just now?  Massive volume.  Dark pool?
Greed was my reason

Evergrande doesn't officially default on offshor bonds until 10/23.  I think next week is clear.
As long as they‚Äôre not too crazy it should rip
1 hundo P. Wish is all you knee
Don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre reading, but today was 70.5 million. On 9/27 we had 61 million.
Watching the gain porn like ü•∞
if job numbers are up and so many jobs still not filled, it may give feds the target to taper the following month
Which is why further downside is unlikely but possible
Dems run senate/house.
Tapering priced in already, good jobs report means the poors are going back to unfuck up this supply problem
You‚Äôre talking to my guy all wrong. You got the wrong tone. Don‚Äôt do it again

If you got spy puts when it broke 441 you could have made almost 100%. I made 93% on mine, holding half for tomorrow
That's what WSB is all about.
What does that have to do with what I said? I said calls *bought at open* ended the day red
u/GoBeaversOSU can we play ban or flair?
CLNE, the powers will try to pump it to off load all the shares they have accumulated. If you are smart you can make a lot following their play.
Look at the S&amp;P 500 daily volume chart.  Insanely low.  Haven't had one this low in like 10 months almost.

Kinda surprising to see it go pretty green on so little volume.

Be happy you've been flaired, I been here awhile and never noticed lol.
Well I certainly wouldn't call it bullish to close below all of its daily moving averages as well as under the 20 and 50 day on the yearly chart. 2x 10/11 438p and 1 10/8 441p bought at close
...off a cliff
Feels like it'll rain 'til the roof caves in...

Nah. It‚Äôs never too late! I never hold shit overnight, hardly ever anyway. I don‚Äôt mind missing out on whatever happens in premarket to make sure I‚Äôm following the right trend. We opened this morning up by like $3.50 already but I was still able to get an easy 30% on calls bought at open.

If they are good that means tapering comes closer which means stocks go down.

SOFI breaking my heart yet again. I just want 21
I think I'm actually on a 5-trade losing streak, will my SPY 10/11 434p end it?

Beautiful shooting star candle on the daily for SPY, right on the declining 20 MA. For the TA noobs this means blood red tomorrow.
2 of my 3 put plays are green
That means you‚Äôre like rich

That‚Äôs fair. I‚Äôve just given up predicting what spy is going to do on the 3 day to week timeframe. It seems like predicting the month or the day timeframe is a bit easier. As you noted most of the time you can see which way the wind is blowing in the first hour of trading, and then sell when the big move of the day is done.
What made you buy spy calls?
Yes
Thank you! I wonder cos sometimes there is quite some PM volume. Of course caused by the institutions but wanted to know if retail can participate too. I know IBKR has the option as well

they were already deployed. who do you think bought the massive selloffs last month? gotta have a buyer to have a seller.
I don‚Äôt really think it will unfold like that though. I was just doing a meme by saying they would vote no so Pelosi can buy more calls. But if there‚Äôs any hiccup in the vote tonight, I think the Dems would issue the coin. And I think it would be a very bad precedent for the US dollar‚Äôs valuation.
U know what makes a man? When you accidentally call your boss/teacher ‚ÄúMom‚Äù and double down and call her ‚ÄúMommy‚Äù until HR finally calls you in

So the only gains that lasted came from the overnight pump? Lol
as long as they manage to deliver expectations, without a doubt. Expectations are high, tho.
I only feel alive while the market is open.

The one time I hope SPY has an actually bullish day -- not a dumb After Hours one -- will be when it metamorphs into an oversized drill and rips out the Earth's core.

Its because everyone here is leveraged to the tits with options
AH and my Account is declining.
My point is you‚Äôre kind of painting yourself into a corner with how precise the predictions you are making. Like the possibility it consolidates around 440 into the next week, in which case you could get totally wrecked.
I sold my puts for a loss and bought calls so you know we‚Äôre for sure gonna be red tomorrow.

I too bought a few calls 4 weeks ago, and got reamed...but no sooner exp than mid-Novembers. MMs and bears had their month of orgiastic glee. But now all those dollars sitting in accounts have to be deployed ASAP to beat inflation. Sideline dollars is dumb money.
It did.

If your hypothesis is correct then waiting until tomorrow for puts is already too late
just a tiny position in Spy puts and vix calls. that's all im willing to risk overnight.

ready for some 0DTE FDs on SPX tmrrw though.
Same I bought them around 440.98, hoping the jobs numbers are high tomorrow so we can dump cause of sooner tapering üî•
Yea sorry man, you're right. I personally think that stupid coin would shed a terrible light on the US financial system, so my puts might be happy with that outcome.

Facebook went üí©

the zuck got cucked
SPY went up 0.80% and everybody‚Äôs crying. Even after the dump AMZN is up 1.25%, I‚Äôm feeling pretty good.
Because most people are investing their money with a time horizon of decades. Trying to time the market is pointless for investors. There are 500 individual companies from tech to energy that people are taking long positions in, not to mention the passive flows of index investment deposited every 2 weeks from peoples paychecks into SPY. You could be waiting around for that crash much longer than you think.
1% up day after a 12% down month? a bubble I tell you
I got 25 contracts. Got at 3:59 down like -125 but im feeling good for tm wbu
4 more minutes to get out of those SPY calls
lol only those two, it cant be an adjustment that still will lead towards recovery
Spy calls at close were the move R-Right....right guys???
Right? I'm only up 8% instead of 13%! The bears won today üò≠üò≠üò≠

Not a great close as I expected. Just enough reason to be bullish but I wouldn‚Äôt be buying here.
Stfu I need confirmation bias
Cash overnight is worth the sleep quality for me for sure
Oops
SPY opens at 440, gets to 443, closes 441. At least that's what my 438c I got at close are hoping for. And then puts with an hour to go, as spy has tanked like 11 of the last 13 trading days in the last 45 min or so.
Buying more WEN
What a dogshit day that was
A lot of WSB members only look at the "squoze"...if anyone didn't take profits at 441, that's on them. You could clearly see that resistance. Bought 10/8 339p and sold right before close.
Meh, why would the Dems vote no though, they're fucked if they say no... Not to mention it would be the most hypocritical thing to do.
Just a reminder that your Jan '22 calls that seem so far from expiration are in fact not so far away.
if they got puts at the top, i'm sure they're doing just fine. i say that as someone who got calls at the top and is eating complete shit.
Same‚Ä¶ your gonna see that print big time.
I‚Äôm bullish overall but I bet we trade sideways for another week or two.

do u have any idea how long a small collection of ppl have been saying this exact same thing?  at 200? at 250? at 300? at 350 at 375 at 400 at 425 the kids who didnt want to buy in at 200 are still salty idiot bears to this day lol.  i bought amazon at like 3200 earllier this week, just go long like a normal person ur missing out on all the profits in 1 year all this downward movement is gona be a minor blip like all the rest on literally every chart
Tsla is F‚Äôd with higher rates on 10 yr.
Did you miss the part where open was a whole 1% higher than close yesterday
McConnel shot Pelosi, but didn't hurt her  
Biden still pumping that infrastructure
Check out the 6M-daily MACD and RSI. We go up. Panic over.
Fake market, Fake numbers.

Wow! Welcome all the new TLRY bag holders
just another manufacturer, good products (if you know to filter out the shit they sell) but bad stock.
Hey bro, I ain‚Äôt hatin though. All I got is a yolo account. I‚Äôll hit it one of these days
Why people don‚Äôt see the manipulation in TSLA is beyond me.  This is big funds making retail pay the price while they sell out.

I bought BABA puts just before close
I am an European so just wondering: do many retail investors have access to PM / AH? Genuine question
#Great News Everyone, we didn't commit economic sudoku!

BOIL GANG
Oh I‚Äôve got day trades, I just didn‚Äôt sell because I‚Äôm retarded
Boring ass day. All the action happened in premarket
Take this gospel for protection
Ahh so your one of those guys I keep selling CC to. I keep averaging down when it goes down, selling CC when it goes up a bit and I'm broken even even though my TLRY is down 8%
Both‚Ä¶ pussy
yea lots of people here have portfolios of &lt;1k
TNX just fuckin mooonin today. Not good for bulls in the long run.
Sitting on a fat pile of cash now. After almost two weeks straight of holding short dated positions overnight and watching futes till 4am, i'm excited to sleep in tomorrow
That‚Äôs what I was thinking (and why I have puts that are up 60%).

This shit is only delayed until December and then we get to go through it all again!!
TSLA save me from my stupid decisions!! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
I'm going full retard on TLRY
At exorbitant prices,  which ends up hurting the consumer.
are you really not going long until spy goes below 400? Have you just been placing all of your 401k contributions since...march...in cash or something?
U rite af
CRSR - why?  Well, why not?
What was? The not shit volume sell off ?
10/11 $435 SPY put. Im bull but gay for tm
GKOS is the way. Thank me later. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Usually I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing, tomorrow I definitely don‚Äôt fucking know
Not sure if you call that a portfolio. More like a yolo.
Confirmed, am white, lost then made money today. üëçüèª
Job report will be what bears are not expecting. SPY 445 EOD
This makes perfect sense. Damn market makes none.
Need to ask my boss for more FD money if they are going to keep asking me to work.
Congrats bulls
You thought the EOD dump was bad, wait for tomorrow lol
Come On, Man!
At least we closed above open so not a total waste of time.
Um, We dont do order flow here, this is wsb.
That daily candle on spy doesn‚Äôt look to good
Lots of bearishness in here. My calls may actually print tomorrow?
Watch the markets continue to drop.
Oh holy shit that was so bearish
I bought puts right before close. Yall know it's about to get üåà in here.
And we‚Äôre still getting that shit. Well maybe not now because of the power shortage.
That‚Äôs cause you‚Äôre a dumbass ape
Loaded up on F, NVDA and BABA calls for tomorrow, lets get it
Market closed pretty green. Tech up 3 days in a row. I‚Äôll gladly take that even though I lost 1/3 of daily gains in the last hour. Days like today often provide the next day room to go up.
If you didn't make, then lose money today, you ain't black.
I hope every permabear commenter obsessed with how ‚Äúunsustainable‚Äù every single upward move is literally dies.
Graduate from Navy BUDS?
Bought mine when SPY was +$6 this morning, still holding overnight because I‚Äôm a degenerate. DAHMP EEEEET!!!
We don't talk about that guy here. Carry on
https://imgur.com/a/sHoQnI8

I have similar forecasts
I think my favorite part of the game is when I think I'm about to win, but then I lose all my money.

Also when we say terrible thing we don't really mean. That is also fun.
Jokes on you, I enjoy fucking myself. I‚Äôll be over in the corner docking myself if anybody needs me
They agreed in theory. The official vote hasn‚Äôt happened.
Only got to end the day with my portfolio up 50% instead of 150%. Damn that SPY dump
But the last two hours üòòüíµü´Ç
You gotta understand these dudes just see green and buy in. They have no fucking strategy, no real actual ideas about potential upside or downside, just cinderblock on the buy button
Yes, because exactly 50% of days are red. If it‚Äôs green one day, it must be red the next. 

Wasn‚Äôt that anal farmer‚Äôs MO?
Easy money
Wow sounds like a fun swing you're on
Told everyone spy to fill gap at 442.  Now we fill gap back down to 436.  Sideways pattern.
That‚Äôs Nacho Cheese!
My recovery gains are now completely flaccid.
Awwwww, the down-voting bears in force, passive-aggressively letting us know how their trading day went.
Debt ceiling was not the catalyst for a return to the uptrend. I wish we could just hit 410 and get this torture over with.
Jesus that close. Time to bust out of the frozen banana to soothe my sore ass.
&gt; Is there anything this guy can‚Äôt do?

Get a job?
Didn't the dems agree to the Republicans offer of delaying the debt ceiling to December?
I want some
Where do you think Silicon Valley outsources its production from?
Consistently, retards buy the top. Imagine actually going long at 438. Like, what? I wouldn't go long at 400.
Beautiful day.  Low volume on shit debt news.  End of day sell offs typically mean red opening next day.
Correction is not completed yet, dead cat bounces will happen, today was one of them
I know right? LOL

Imagine not selling after that giant morning shrek dick and then just holding all day until your shit goes red LMAO
I couldn't either. We're smart. I almost just got puts
Whoa, you dangerous!
Holding calls is like having 2 dicks and no chicks. Just gotta go fuk yourself
I‚Äôm in a zoom meeting üò°üò°üò°
imagine not swinging from bull to bear day to day ü§£ü§£
Love the 35M volume on TLRY.  Hope this goes AH.
Yeah I have calls but I know I fucked up
sell idiot, you have until 415
1:30 - Dan Bilzerian announces short position in SPY stock

4:00 - SPY down .8% from 1:30

Haters gonna hate. Is there anything this guy can‚Äôt do?
Wow totally laughing my ass off!!!!!!
pro tip: look at closing candles everyday to see big boys‚Äô sentiment for the next day
all that for SPY to lose 3 fucking cent from open
bought QQQ puts at the close, the action in yields today spooked me. will dump tomorrow if we continue up    
still long energy, banks, and Russell e-minis
That‚Äôs too damn bad! You keep digging!
Imagine losing money on calls when SPY had a +0.9% green day

Only on WSB
I got 40k in Amazon leaps. LFG!!
Well if TLRY can't make it past $12 tomorrow I'm totally fucked. Good thing I get paid every Friday to fuel my gambling addictions
Only bad if it hurts us more than it hurts them.
Lmao. SPY calls bought at open ended the day red, that‚Äôs amazing. 

Look at that 1 month and 1 year chart. Rejected hard, lower highs. I made money on calls this morning but I‚Äôm pretty sure the play tomorrow morning is gonna be puts again‚Ä¶
[deleted]
Saw the TIME magazine cover with Zuck on it late this morning and realized I can‚Äôt stand him and bought puts and it was my best play in awhile üòÇ
What is going to happen next
Does it ever get tiring, endlessly calling for a market crash that never comes?
I imagine the Dems will vote no on the debt ceiling bill, wait for tomorrow -3% so Pelosi can buy some more calls, then issue the $1 trillion dollar coin to show they don‚Äôt need republicans support.
NTRB running and no one talking about it, I actually made a good pick!
Debt ceiling rising coming out tn or tomorrow according to Biden pushing it by EOW.

$450 open if it‚Äôs tn
Made so much cheddar from those 440p and 439p fuk u bulls that laughed at me. So dumb .
I don't think so.  The sellers have just dropped away the past two days.
[deleted]
What they did to that green candle EOD is despicable
I have a wonderful feeling tomorrow is gonna be an epic dump. Completely unjustified pump over the last 30 hours. Debt ceiling issue was never really an issue..if anything that's even more bearish that we're spending more. Making a disaster even worse
i'm tired of this grandpa
I'll fucking take that $6K profit day. You dumb bears ignoring technicals on big tech gonna be sucking a lot of dick behind Wendy's like you do 3 out of every 4 weeks real soon.
go for a fucking walk
Bulls make money, bears make money, theta gang makes money, apes make conspiracies
I just couldn‚Äôt pull the trigger to buy spy options today. Does that make me a good trader or a pussy?
Look the history of my messages, I was warning you today, I was warning you all week, I was warning you all month, buy $SPXU, hold until spy is 390. Take the profit.
Holy fuck, thermal googles are underrated
Good idea
Nancy?
Bulls with surprised Pikachu face SpY doesn't do a straight line up
dk why you‚Äôre getting downvoted. your comments crack me up; livens up this place
Why was travel down so much?
Dude do it it drastically improves your comfort
went to get some gas...fucking went up again!
U.S. goods imports from China accounted for 18.1% of overall U.S. goods imports in 2019.

Imagine thinking that a trade war with China was a good idea. 

Will be a boon for both economies when it ends.
You know what they say: timing the market beats time in the market
SPY calls better be the move
&gt;DOW JONES UNOFFICIALLY CLOSES UP 330.11 POINTS, OR 0.96% , AT 34,747.10

NASDAQ UNOFFICIALLY CLOSES UP 142.49 POINTS, OR 0.98% , AT 14,644.40

Leverage up to my personal risk tolerance so I can win or lose a year's salary by noon
Insider trading
I held too‚Ä¶..because I have no day trades. But the good news is jobs report is tomorrow and that‚Äôs probably going to catch bulls by surprise and it‚Äôll be not what they are wanting
Can‚Äôt wait for that 1% gap up again üòà
[deleted]
Made $24 today, feeling pretty good
Told you suckers SPY 438. Order flow at 441 was the tell. Learn to read the tape!!!
I believe they are called Moose
either tomorrow we confirm we are in a downtrend or we go to valhalla and beyond
Bought FB calls EOD. Weeklies, but also monthlies
Market is weak as fuck we're going right back down. Y'all really thinking the debt ceiling is the "only" issue
finished up 6% today, i'll take it. hope some more calls print tomorrow but i locked in enough profits today that i should be good
Market ended green‚Ä¶ I ended red. Fuck
Im a big fat bull but for tm im bear . First time ive ever shorted SPY
open 438 close 438
[deleted]
Mah neck hurts I need an aleve
3 green days in a row. I am in disbelief. 

Tomorrow i lose it all!
I made $9 today
I'm gonna regret holding my spy calls when market opens tomorrow.
Tesla 800c  FDs went from -600 to +6000 and then to +1400 :/
Going up almost 30% in the last 5 mins was almost better than sex üêª
No longer have a position, but good lord, FB, what happened????
1.5 million pump on the last minute Jesus Christ
i actually managed to break even for the year again. 100% cash gang, short puts now. thanks chyna

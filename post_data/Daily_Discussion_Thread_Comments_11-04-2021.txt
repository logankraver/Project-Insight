I honestly can‚Äôt believe I haven‚Äôt made any money during this bull run. I‚Äôm so bad at this.
Cathie did a classic wsb retard move with Zillow. Bought 2 days ago and sold yesterday for a negative 25% ‚Äúprofit‚Äù üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Good god. Tesla is unstoppable
Blood bath & beyond üíÄ
my stock experience so far

"wow it's at all time high, it's too risky to buy here" -> keeps going up anyways

examples: nvda, amd, tsla, goog


"wow this stock is down so much, it's a steal at this price" -> keeps going down

examples: tsm, amzn, pypl, dis


never lucky
Dude it‚Äôs been like 1000 days how the fuck are some of you still shorting tech ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
For a brief moment tesla was just $1234.56
So the TSLA run isn't over. Huh.
Bers not ded. They extinct
Cathie Wood bag holding a literal billion dollars of Zillow on 11/1.

She buys the dip at 11/2, cost basis is still $82.50 after averaging down.

Z tanks 24.92% on 11/3 and Wood sells the dip she bought just a day before for a massive loss.

Zillow is trading today at $69.80 (+6.58%).

Cathie Wood should be a mod at /r/wallstreetbets

Biggest flex of 2021, I made money on TSLA puts.     


Bought some, stock went down, I realized I was stupid, sold for a $1,000 gain and got out within like 15 minutes of buying.  Thank god I did, would have lost my ass.

My 1300 tesla calls might make me guh or run outside butt naked screaming üò±
NVDA getting upgrades like every other day but I still can‚Äôt upgrade my GPU üíÄ

Bears make money so rarely, they go make a movie about it
I will never understand Tesla.... like who looks at this price and thinks... yeah, looks like a good play.
SP500 can‚Äôt even dip 0.20% without the dip getting bought. People have so much money, why can‚Äôt I be the same
Wow who fomo‚Äôd into NVDA calls 20 minutes ago and lost their ass?

Bears after a 0.23% mid day dip: This is finally it!
I expected the fed announcement to tank spy.  It didn't.  I sold my puts for a 1.5k loss and bought 3k of SPY calls.  There is too much optimism to fight the markets logic, might as well join them.

SPY to a billion!  Or 470 in two weeks so my calls print.

TSLA dips $20 from ATH and wsb loses their minds
Timing the market will always be better than time in the market
And just like that, F is finally on its way to rightfully becoming a growth stock. I mean it‚Äôs only going to be the #2 player in a field where the #1 player has a >$1T market cap - no big deal‚Ä¶
every day I see NVDA way higher than yesterday and I say I'll wait until it comes down, never does. Is this how bears feel looking at the whole market? Damn.

If NVDA support at 295 doesn't hold, we could retrace to levels not seen since a couple hours ago.
It's more painful on missing out gains, especially monster 10 bagger gains like the NVDA and AMD calls I sold yesterday, than realizing 100% loss on having your options expire worthless.
Spy to 500‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs literally in the name??
Who is even writing call options anymore

Tesla is consolidating to either run up or down and my calls would like to know which one soon
Here‚Äôs a fact for you. In the **last month** SPY has risen by the same amount as it did from November2019-January2021 . And that time period was considered ridiculously bullish.
AMD to $200
This better not be another one of those bull traps that ends up being a bear trap that ends up being a bull trap but is actually a bear trap.

This is the biggest sign that a correction is coming.

Put 13k into TSLA this morning.. up 1.5% , put 900 into NVDA this morning.. up 115% . Moral of the story, should e put it all on NVDAAAAAA
that 0.05% bank account savings rate is looking pretty attractive compared to this - 50% savings rate I've got going
People who write APPL instead of AAPL deserve to lose money on it.
Geeez NVDA, I should‚Äôve have just put all my money in you a few years ago and done nothing
I‚Äôm buying this TSLA dip!

Only down 10 grand today, how is everyone else?
Literal 125x baggers on NVDA OTM calls today. Should‚Äôve copped 500 at 0.01 and flipped em at 1.25 id be rich
NVDA is literally insane today and I love it.
NVDA GONNA NEED ANOTHER SPLIT AT THIS RATE
its hilarious that we're at ATH but there are still ppl clutching onto their CLOV, SDC, or WISH hoping for "the day" to come.
F it. Just got a Ford leap
I‚Äôve lost control of my life
SPY has gone up almost 10% this month *with NO* Infrastructure or Spending Bill. just saying

jpow the type of uncle to give you $100 at family gatherings when u were 12.

what a homie
Glad NVDA settled down for a little bit here. If it goes on autopilot for the final 30 minutes, that would be great.
Just buy calls and puts on every stock and you literally can‚Äôt lose
"woman says sex with dave portnoy was frightening" lmao what a headline

Imagine the market being open on Saturday. That shit would be so fun
My MRNA calls üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Fuck, sold covered 55C w/ expiry tomorrow back on Monday.  DKNG has gone down or remained flat, yet the options have tripled in value.  Learning the hard way not to sell covered calls before earnings.  IV goes up as you get closer.  Sell CCs closer to earnings. Lesson learned.
remember when Dr Pepper made Dr Pepper Ten and the commercials literally flat out said "IT'S NOT FOR WOMEN"
Holding my tesla 1300 calls till eod to much positive momentum. God I hope I'm right or I'm fucked lmaoooo.
Honestly the only reason why TSLA keeps going up is because I stayed away from it, consistently believing it was the top. I will accept your thank you's at any point because if I had given up and bought in it would be at $300 rn.
Yo nvidia is going to 500 before eom
Imagine buying MRNA at $500.
Ford might be a boomer, but he just got divorced from his old hag wife, started dating a 22 y/o stunner, and got a blue pill prescription from his doctor. BUY NOW!

I feel like the only one mot making money today. Feels bad man
AMD or NVDA

Sasuke or Naruto
Nvidia with those 30 baggers
Wtf is going on with spy why does this always happen when I look away
Calls can be a bitch sometimes, up 5 cents? You get 1 dollar, down 5 cents? Your calls have now expired worthless
Should I buy TSLA or a half pound of weed?
NRDS halted. Stupid allocation only got me 27 shares out of 200 requested
Hard to buy NVDA options that are already up like 4000%
Keep in mind that we won‚Äôt even be back to normal 2% interest rates until 2023 at the earliest now, and supply chain issues are only improving each month from here on out. That‚Äôs what matters. Bears come back after spring if you want to take a shot at the SPY, as someone who made a killing on puts during the sep-oct mini correction, this ain‚Äôt the time. Just trying to help. Waiting can be profitable, we are clearly staying bullish until spring

NVDA gain porn will take over the sub tonight. You're welcome, since I didn't buy any, which would have sent it to zero.
My advice (not advice): YOLO until you become a long-term investor.

More good news
Cmon Tesla shoot up like the good ole days of last week
Yep, I'm never buying SPY puts again
I can‚Äôt wait to smoke weed and cuddle with my cat while looking at my portfolio
NVIDIA keeps pumping tomorrow?
Can we jerk off as a collective to the NVDA gain porn later
haha nvda go brrrr
I‚Äôm up 10% on my NVDA puts I bought 5 mins ago, despite the underlying going up. I love implied volatility, though I‚Äôm too smooth brained to understand it.
TSLA COME ON ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
all the tech stocks should just keep splitting and watch the stock go back to the pre-split price within a year then split again. infinite money glitch
Nvda gained more today than I‚Äôve earned since I bought into AMD about a month ago.  Congrats to all you NVDA options holders!
I will be Lisa Su's sex slave if she gets AMD to 200.
So I guess everything just keeps going up then? No pullback, no correction, nada, zip, zilch, nothing. Cool, cool
Sold nvda calls this morning for 950 they $7000 now wtf is going on seriously
Everytime I check NVDA its up another $5 WTF
Bought an nvda call for $260 this morning, sold for $500. It‚Äôs worth $3k right now. ü§°
It's weird how it feels worse to sell early than to hold for a loss with conviction
NVDA Calls are going to a different galaxy right now... what's going to happen in 2 weeks when they have earnings!!
you're telling me if i would have fomo'd in NVDA at 300 I would be sittin pretty right now...jesus
NVDA breaking some rules of physics here.
How do you look at Nvidia and not buy puts?
Last call, SPY 468 EOD, loaded to the fucking tits in calls

Nvda back to 310
No way you‚Äôre actually shorting nvda
20 shares of TSLA shorted at $1,240.69
So is this where GME just fucks around and bleeds back to $170 over the month?
Cause I bought a $1265 call for tomorrow and it‚Äôs down $700 already
I‚Äôm eating air for the rest of next year
I'm over here praying logitech holds above $80 while NVIDIA hit $313 today. 

It's like watching a midget fight a genetically modified honey badger....he stands no chance.

Officially a millionaire thanks to NVDA!

Wow
My gf is about to be the recipient of a Thursday back door pump n dump.
Hey WSB,

Some of you may have been here yesterday for my absolute meltdown. I freaked out losing so much money and was acting irrationally. I really appreciate the kind words of support from a bunch of strangers. It made it a whole lot better. Once my head cleared, I realized that I am not as completely fucked as I thought I was. I will still be here on the daily trading with my degenerate friends. But I learned a valuable lesson in risk management. 

Once again thanks for being decent human beings and supporting me in the shitty situation I got myself in. I really appreciate it. Also, I learned JPOW does in fact make printer go brrrr.

Cheers and thanks
I woke up way too early ü•±üò¥

its only 2 months left but i would seriously question putting any real money in any ARK funds with the way they trade for rest of the year and beyond

Z is latest example

accumulates through flat period. adds even more this very Monday after earnings and "dip" - this is after all relevant info is now out to the market

but immediately dumps Monday's buy and much more the following day for an even bigger L

Probably time to sell these
NVDA & AMD were the play üî•
Nkla up 6%. I've seen it all now
$Z will drop to at least sub 60 today based on where it was pre-2020 boom

Did nvda start shitting magical silicon?
I'm in so much pain today. Sold my NVDA and AMD calls yesterday.
Just a reminder to the bears that being early is the same as being wrong when you‚Äôre a bear, only bulls have time on their side. You‚Äôre still early. And based on JPOW yesterday we are legit getting a repeat of this year in 2022 so being a bear calling ‚Äúthe top‚Äù in 2022 will be early as well. I don‚Äôt like the US indexes as high as they are either I‚Äôd like to buy some real dips, but I‚Äôm also realistic and know when the music is playing or stopping. GREEN LIGHT BITCHES, don‚Äôt fight the fed you will not win.

SPY hasn't been red for more than 48 hours since Oct. 11th.
  
If you bought SPY at any point since then, your position has done nothing but go up on a 48hr timeline.
FYI: 

US Labor Productivity: -5% for the quarter

US Labor Costs: +8% for the quarter
Imagine working for $12/hour
NVDA blasting through 300$ unbelievable
One upgrade for NVDA cause it to move 14%.    This is the bull market
Buy semiconductors idiots.
I feel nothing.
Just bought a put on NVDA. How retarded am I?
Whoever has NVDA calls, you're welcome. I sold mine for a small profit then it just refueled the rocket even more
investors with decades of experience always say to buy low sell high, but in this market only buying high and selling higher works. You buy anything that's 'low' and it only goes lower or sideways, it's unbelievable
NVDA is GOD
Jeep pickup truck owners, why?
Excited to see the NVDA gain posts.
blew up my options account and turned my last $700 into 6k in 2 weeks. however if i didnt paperhand positions, i‚Äôd be at like 20k. smh
I bought NVDA FD‚Äôs on a whim this morning. 28 bagger but I have no more day trades left‚Ä¶ ü§û
So who picked up some $.01 NVDA calls yesterday? Are you supersizing your happy meal later?
Fuck it F just double already
Thanks to that guy who said, ‚Äòbuy NVDA 3/22 300c‚Äôs at open‚Äô. What a play.
Buying a NVDA call now might be stupid enough to work
Nvda, I‚Äôve came ten times already, can we just chill?
Buying NVDA lottos wish me luck
I just left so much money on the table selling my NVDA 11/5 300C at 11am this morning. I hate everything and yet I still made money
NVDA got me feeling like I‚Äôm on blow.
its still fucking going

i dont even need to say the ticker and y'all know what im talking about
NVDA is on crack
Fuck, gonna be Lot of NVDA/AMD Gain Porn today lol.
Sold my NVDA calls way too early it seems.
Now I feel good about dumping my life savings into NVDA a little over two weeks ago. Cashed out half now, let's see how high it goes today.
For every contract of the weekly NVDA 320c's you bought yesterday (they were legit 1 fucking dollar each yesterday), you have now made $600 on each one lmao.  Nothing to see here.  Just 60,000% gains happening in front of our eyes.  Not sure anyone would buy lottos like that, but if you did you're rich now
NVDA up 52% in a month is absolutely bonkers
Trading NVDA options at 300 strike was not what I expected today but I go where the autism takes me.
NVDA gain porn will be next level today geez
If I had held NVDA past my 20% gain goals today I would have like 1500% gains by now even after the rug pull. Gain is gain though.
Watch NVDA close at exactly $300 üòÇ
Damn I'm a fucking ü§°. How tf is everything red in my account
Breaking news:  NVDA rocket is out of fuel suddenly, Please fasten your seat belt. 

It is gonna be a wide ride.

Tesla just filed a patent for "GENERATING GROUND TRUTH FOR MACHINE LEARNING FROM TIME SERIES ELEMENTS'." Does anybody have any idea what this means?
They're putting ai's on the Wendy's dumpsters to put you out of business
Sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs‚Ä¶ and Yes, ground truth is the input you use to train a neural net. So, they are using ‚Äòtime‚Äô as their ground truth. A 4D approach. 

I think they showed this in AI day and this is just the patent for it.
I should probably answer what you're actually curious about too instead of just talking shit about Tesla.

If you pretend it means something, like whoever wrote it was pretending, I guess it just suggests they're teaching an AI about time series analysis.
It's gibberish that doesn't mean anything, the patent would get rejected for that drivel alone if the US had a real patent system
Probably something with grounding electric current
Imagine the retail that could finally buy Tesla shares if they did a 10:1 split? Theyd probably only have a day before it was out of their budget tho.
When the music stops playing, I hope you can find a chair to sit on
The biggest mistake ive made was selling a bit of Tesla during a pullback.
Taking profit is never a mistake.

Don't buy that option. Market makers know you plan to do so and have priced that in.
The thought of it is priced in too, so don't even think about it
Yes, exactly. The only plays that will make you money are ones you haven't thought about whatsoever before making.

Up 15% pre market on TSLA shares. Should I sell or hold til 1300 ?
Bro. Any time anyone says should ‚ÄúI sell TSLA‚Äù within 1 week they say ‚ÄúI left xxx on the table‚Äù
Hold
TSLA 2000 eoy
why sell at 1300?
Sell covered calls at at strike +30%
I‚Äôm a eurofag. None of my brokers allow options :(
Saxo.
Wait until TSLA hits $5000 by 2023
How are you up 15%? It‚Äôs only up 2.5
because his avg price is 15% lower than current pre market price. What part of that is hard for you to understand?
Then he‚Äôs not up 15% in premarket. He is just up 15% in general and it‚Äôs currently pre market..

If you sell it goes up more.. If you hold it dips

Depends. Do you hate money?
Hold for 20 years, man. Keep stacking shares and sell calls.
I bought sooooo much MRNA stock over the last couple weeks. I am financially obliterated.
If you bought the stock you are fine.  If you bought calls you'd be in trouble

So SAVA $300 today
So zillow has a robot outbid real people for houses. Now they will sell them for a loss to companies like Blackrock so they can rent them and jack the prices. Housing crisis seems pretty fake and gay
Zillow needs to offer the same deal to people as it does to crackrock.

Y‚Äôall buying NRDS?
Yes!!
Sold my nvda 50 265 weekly calls at open.. pain, missed out on almost 10x gains.
Initially thought you meant you sold naked calls. That would have been way worse.
I‚Äôm beginning to think weeklies and 0DTE calls should not be a part of my investment strategy ü§°ü§°ü§°
NVDA has almost doubled my IRA
NVDA in my IRA is up 88% but I can't touch that money. Ugh
65 year old you will be thankful
I have NVDA and SAVA calls so you could say it‚Äôs been a good day
Go SAVA
Hell yeah! Hoping it continues to run
SHOW ME THE NVDA GAIN PORN
Yo NVDA i bought leaps, not weeklies, chill the fuck out.
i was going to do 1dte this am but went a monthlies at 300, its printing fat but damn those 290c 1dte would of been a fucking massive bag lol
stupid fuckin bears lmao
Thank you to the retard who told me to buy SAVA
so i guess now its NVDA's turn to become a trillion dollar cap lol
Grabbed the $470 spy calls that expire Friday
Fucking hell NVDA, i know i didnt buy in yesterday. No need to rub it in my face like this.
NVDA: "if TSLA can add 100 billion in market cap in a day over jack shit then so can I, fuk the bears"
Is there any news? At least TSLA had the Hertz order.
NVDA announced they are ordering TSLAs for their employees as well as giving their bonuses this year in dog themed fake currency
lol so true.
Found the packers fan
Fuck me. I'm so salty for being impatient. My NVDA leaps that I bought 9 weeks ago and then sold 2 weeks after would have printed massively today and maybe more in the future.
same boat as you.
Just check my robinhood while eating and almost choked when I saw NVIDIA
Jerome Powell as his portfolio drops 10% in a week last March:

"HOLY FUK, WERE TAKING INTEREST RATES TO 0, AND PRINTING AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF MONEY. I SWEAR TO GOD I MEAN INFINITE, KEEP TANKING I DARE YOU"

Jerome Powell as stocks go up 100% in a day with markets at ATH, and the economy getting squeezed by the bullshit 5% inflation prints:

"Hold on there fellas, we need to be patient here, lets wait and see what happens next year. No need to panic, inflation is a good thing. We are at least a years away from rate hikes, no need to worry"
What they're doing to OCGN is disgusting.
# Bring back the printers! NVDA $300
I put about 3 seconds of analysis into this and decided that weed stonks typically trail tech-meme stonks by about 4.20 days. Accordingly to my calculations, get your calls now on anything weed . God speed retards
TSLA just gonna melt up all day. ATH AH.
1250 at close. 1275 ah
Chip Gang has ascended. 

We are now 

#METAVERSE GANG
Imagine sleeping in late to wake up to NVDA +10%  
and realizing after coffee that you bought NDVA last night
and the coffee was just a jar of your piss from last night
Worth it
Why is NVDA going up?

I bought it drunk yesterday and put my whole portfolio in because it had a downvoted controversial comment on the daily thread
Wells Fargo price target
Always drink and trade
Big news at the keynote event on Tuesday looks like it‚Äôll hype up until Tuesday morning

Profitability only 15 years away!
sold NVDA way too early this morning, damnit. But profit is profit I guess..
NVDA 800% ROI into SPY 475C 11/10 

Today is going well w/ no addy
I thought buying Tesla at $500 was expensive but shit just doesn‚Äôt stop going up
And to think I could‚Äôve got in at 500-800 too at multiple points lol. My rule is once you feel FOMO it‚Äôs too late but that fuckin stock is pissing me off with FOMO.
[deleted]
Wait, he‚Äôs a piece of shit? I couldn‚Äôt tell.
I'm so confused right now.
Too many people in here sound happy.  I am taking this as a close out and wait.
I deserve this ban. I‚Äôm sorry JPow for my lack of faith
Something fucky is goin on. Like the market is holding its breath üßê

NVDA hits 300!!!!!!!
Holy shit. They fucking did it.
God bless
Why?  Is there news?
the big push into the metaverse is going to require their tech.
May have to paper hand this NVDA call. I'll be sick if it runs again tomorrow, but this $1 call is over $5.
Could be $20 by tomorrow
Could be $.50

And NVDA would have to run over 335.
So we are in a tech/meme/corn bubble right?
Looks like it. All that remain are buyers pretending this is normal.
CORN BUBBLE
oh my gourd! just in time for thanksgiving
Bubbles don't have to pop
Mmmhm yup this is the top
How long have we been in a bubble?
Corn? What did I miss?
Corn = cryp toe
Dam, like I needed to feel any more retarded
Ev too
Of course there is already a squid game porno called squirt game.

Yeah it‚Äôs pretty good. Only saw the first game tho
Well, I thought a 6% gain on NVDA today was nice and then I saw that it doubled...

at what price?
‚ÄúHi Mickey Mouse, I‚Äôd like to speak to the manager of Disney‚Äù

Like seriously what the fuck is going on with DIS? 6 month low, normally always bounces back in days let alone the couple weeks it‚Äôs been sucking. On top of that, the news is flooded with institutions buying into DIS or buying more. Could this global monster of a company act like it please and thanks.
They haven't released Hamilton on DVD or Blu Ray yet and investors are losing confidence
Mouse peens gunna go green, !banbet DIS 180 4w
I‚Äôm sure it is eventually but fuck I‚Äôm on round 3 of calls and if I actually have to sell these for a loss (the others were small profit/break even) I‚Äôd like to avoid the wash sale rule on this L I‚Äôm about to take and probably miss when it finally moves.
Good luck out there, may the mouse be forever in your favour
Sold 10 of my 20 for just over break even. The other 10 are now up 20% of course. Mouse spooked me too much.
They overestimated their streaming adoptions and the parks are losing money. Why would it go up?
Back in August it was announced that their parks were back to making profit again, after the fat L they took from Covid. You can‚Äôt tell me that seeing money return back into that and the fact that the consensus seems to be Disney will beat earnings expectations = price should be at 6 month low.
Actually, that sounds about right. All of the price action prior to that was upward movement based on expected growth. Once it‚Äôs confirmed, it‚Äôs not unusual for investors to sell the news and find the next potential play.
Amazing MSFT calls today paid off my motorcycle lol

I made money on Tesla calls and Tesla puts today. I guess I‚Äôm bisexual?
Well. Bought calls on NVDA at their very top. Still printing
Same
Mine aren‚Äôt. They‚Äôre staying red yet I bought 3% lower than what the price is. Too far OTM I guess with 325
Bought 10 shares into NVDA at $200, thinking that might‚Äôve been the top lol
NVDA getting into EV rentals
Looked at nvda all day thinking it can't go higher and just does. Fuck me I'm not gonna chase still

i do this everyday. Its like i cant be happy with a successful trade because i am so used to being unhappy with my losses lol
Lol. Nvda 300c exp tomorrow up 21,000%. (No, not saying I did it)
LCID is my savior now. Come on baby
Sold my 272.5 NVDA calls today for 1100% gain.. oh the fucking pain
You are a warrior. Always give props to the man that pulls out
I grabbed some Jan puts for $250. It has to come down some. They are appreciating nicely with the rise as the IV increases
Did Jpow announce yesterday that along with tapering bond purchases he would also start buying NVDA shares?
Omg is nvda broken
Felt real smart when I sold that nvda 300c after ten minutes this morning.   Oof now.
All I can say is you‚Äôre not alone
I sold my 270c at 9:32am so I feel. Thankfully I still have a 280c
F
you arent alone friend :(
[deleted]
Success!
retard buying intc.
every strike i fomoed into on NVDA today and kept rolling up kept going ITM

i'm starting to think i should have just diamond handed them all

275c, 280c, 290c...

welp.
I‚Äôm on the same boat
What do we do now? 320?
i took last gain on 290c before it broke 305 so dont ask me, i'm just leaving $ on the table apparently
Looks like you‚Äôve made the right choice. It‚Äôs good to take some profit off the table, especially after this monstrous rally. But I rolled up cause why the heck not lol
We‚Äôll see what it does at their earning on 11/17.
eh its a minor pull back but who the F knows where it lands next few weeks

talk about a pre ER run up eh
Yea that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm betting on but who knows

MCD entering the metaverse with digital McDoubles. Now your virtual avatar can better resemble your real world fat self.
fuckin hell NVDA. I thought i made out like a bandit when it was up 7% earlier today. If i had known....


Take your profits and run today, I'll be buying back in tomorrow morning during the dip.
I‚Äôm up $1000 on the $315C 11/9. Bought at 12pm. I‚Äôm thinking I should use a day trade to sell it. Who knows what happens tomorrow right?
I've been playing with NVDA for the past few weeks. It's always down the day after a green day. I can almost guarantee it'll be down tomorrow with the insane run today. If it was a longer dated call I'd say you'd be good cause it'll keep going up with earnings coming up. But I'd sell and buy a longer dated call tomorrow.
Thanks for this!!!
I just sold it.
How about that AMD stock huh
I literally one call away from hitting 100k with nvda damn
NVDA cured cancer.
Bro‚Ä¶.what is happening‚Ä¶NVDA
OKAY NVDA I ALREADY SAID THAT‚ÄôS ENOUGH YOU‚ÄôRE STARTING TO ENTER SOME DANGEROUS TERRITORY HERE YOUNG MAN.
In my college dorm there was an Nvidia outbreak
I wouldn‚Äôt have known about mine
The blow off top correction in this market will be epic.
I hope vix goes back to 200
I know some of you fomo'd nvda at 312.
Half this sub bout to be wiped
Nvidia single handed saved my account
I‚Äôm perfectly fine with a dip and a correction, but NVDA free falling for the final hour would be such a limp dick feeling.
Boooooy the mess I will make on this screen if it does.
V is like an ex you keep calling up every now and then for some fun. Then you realize why you don't want to be near them. Fuck you, V.
Great market cap, but that 6month chart and YTD chart is an ugly one to look at
lmao. 305c for NVDA expiring tomorrow went from being worth $9 yesterday at close to $700 right now.
Spoke too soon. We fukt
lmao now they‚Äôre only $510 jesus
My NVDA puts are exploding

I have 11/26 290P, 11/12 285P and 11/05 290P both purchased at $310-312
Lol how tf did NVDA do this. Pls explain
Metaverse announced by Facebook (Meta?) and Microsoft. Who do you think can power that kind of alternative reality, Fox News? Nope, NVDA with the most powerful graphics cards in the world.
I‚Äôm talking about the drop from 312 to 299. Killed my profit. It‚Äôs going back up tho so no biggie
NVDA buy the dip. Tmrw you will be millionaire when it reaches 320.

yeah sorry bout those nvda cc's. I just sold some call spreads for tomorrow. ya gotta love seeing the calls spread that you just sold are up like 400-800% today. I don't wanna say it's free money but its damn close..cant possibly see nvda climbing another 10% tomorrow

I‚Äôm jealous
TSLA is squeezing to $1337 a share, next week when this price hits, Elon will likely tweet 'lol 1337 dude.' Once his tweet is seen by millions of apes, the stock will rocket to $1420.69 a share. From here he will likely tweet 'thinking of taking tesla private at 1420.69 a share.'  


I blew my YOLOad into $1335c and $1420c for next week. Good luck to all.
This is well researched dd. Bravo
GOOD LUCK BROTHER

The US national debt is about to hit 29T, is this anything to worry about or do stonks just only go up?
Don't worry rates will stay at 0% forever so the debt will remain barely serviceable
no worries, debt only go up
shhhh, dont jinx our run
Who says we have to pay it back
They should just print 29T and pay it off /s
It‚Äôs just 29 of those trillion dollar coins, easy
We‚Äôve been in debt since WW2
JPow be like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll print so much money that inflation will make that much less of a concern‚Äù
> US national debt

Debt isn't inherently bad. It's about how the government use it.

Cmon ford lets get another good day
[this family adopted like 15 kids and they're complaining about food prices](https://twitter.com/brikeilarcnn/status/1456227125346832384)

>"A gallon of milk was $1.99. Now it's $2.79. When you buy **12 gallons a week** times four weeks, that's a lot of money."

like i also am experiencing the higher food prices but come on i have no sympathy there

also they're fat
Also milk isn't a need. They could easily just drink water...
also maybe don't have a family the size of a small village with only two providers
I mean, I'd be up for giving, hopefully loving, families that adopt as much financial help as possible
sure i'm 100% in support of these families getting more money but the news piece is about inflation as if this family is an average family
Yeah true point
That‚Äôs like $40. Isn‚Äôt the government giving them a check for each kid now anyway lol
This is exactly like the episode of futurama where Bender adopts like 30 orphans to get the monthly government stipend for each üòÇ
"OUR DADDY'S A GIANT TOY!"
idk how the child tax credit thing works tbh but maybe that's why they have so many kids they're just trying to take advantage
My understanding would be 15 kids is around 4 grand a month so $40 in that alone is a drop in the bucket
damn i'm bout to go adopt a bunch of kids
someone who is good at the economy please help me budget this. my family is dying
Sad!

How many times do I have to wake up to TSLA blowing through my max loss before I learn my lesson
CALLS ON CALLS ON CALLS
Didn‚Äôt sell the news on OCGN. Guess I‚Äôm holding these bags a while longer.
I held my spy calls, am I retarded
I hope not cuz I did too lmao
Let's rife fellow retard
Yes but so is the market so congratulations
No
What's gonna stop it from going up?
A technical gap down after a major run
Lol at technicals.
It's not retarded to say spy will go down one day if it runs 4 Dollars another day lol
I mean, that's not technicals though. That's obvious.

It's been overbought for weeks. There *is* a dip coming and I'll try to catch it with puts on the way down and calls on the way up. I'm no dummy.
I gotta start pulling my calls, this upward movement is insane
I cannot believe it. My limit didn't hit by like 2 cents and then it ran. Would have have almost 20% gain already.

I'll be looking for some puts here today dated end of next week. This thing needs to pull back at least a few bucks.
I bought the second they said rates were staying the same, best financial decision I've made all week
I'm thinking the same, I'm probably going to close in another dollar, probably before the 10:30 dip, I can't play puts though, I don't have the skill
Bears what has the past month been like for you? Are you okay?
No we‚Äôre broke.
hope whoever asked for the TSLA morning dip actually buys it and doesn't pussy out
The billionaires are using TSLA to play poker
Also I fucking can't believe NVDA just a straight line up for a month jesus christ
Ford is going ü•ú nuts
I was the guy bitching about not being able to sell my Tesla calls at 2pm yesterday because of day trades üòé
I bought before close and was like fuck I fucked up. Now look. And it‚Äôll pump again too today. I hope. üòé
This has gotta be a dead cat bounce wtf Zillow doing lmao üòÇ
Cathie Woods sold to close...so yah naturally it's pumping again lol
Bull trap. Institutions are pushing it up on low volume temporary as retail jumps in thinking it was a dip and this is cheap. Meanwhile institutions will continue to offload their shares. They can‚Äôt offload all at once or the price will tank to fast. This way they can hemorrhage some of their losses.
NVDA doesn't give a shit about fuck. Moonnnnn
So my Z puts went from +300% to -69% nice!
If tsla can manage to grind above 1250, it‚Äôll explode.
##Bears eating air for dinner
Any fellow bears? üò∞
We are a rare breed
Sadly
I‚Äôm bearish on Z let‚Äôs see what happens, either big money is setting up retail to hold bags or they might join in, and stay in

Amd calls yesterday was the right choice
amd calls all week were the right choice
AMD calls all the time are the right choice. Just give yourself enough time in case it consolidates for extended periods. Leaps!
my LEAPS are all up 100-200% holy fukeroni
Sofi about to blast off üöÄ
AMD merger Monday? I fucking HOPE SO!!!!
Oh the missed opportunities
the nvda calls i sold for a loss (lol) yesterday wouldve been a 5 bagger today ü§°
Gains everywhere and I‚Äôm too fucking scared to make a move lmao
Up 100% on AMD calls in 15 min üòÇ imagine being a bear
I doubled my account value in the first 30 min of trading.
Fuck I need a cigarette
So easy even a retard like myself is making money
Is anyone eyeing draft kings rn
PENN feels like a good buy
Shit move today so don't bother with earnings unless puts.
ME: What an Xbox Series X is $500 I‚Äôm not paying that ! I‚Äôll wait till the price goes down. 
Also ME: Buys GME calls loses double that in 10 minutes. That‚Äôs okay I‚Äôll make it back !
It‚Äôs truly spectacular how our minds just disregard fat losses üòÇ
nvda literally does not stop holy fuK
Cold part- I owned 200 shares at 185 cost basis end of 2019 and sold when it ran up to \~220. Missed out on 185k in run up ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
fuck man i feel that pain
Super painful. I love the company too but it kept fcking around dipping to 165, running up a bit. Now I only hold 30 shares üòÇ
it's okay man you still made profit... just missed out on a ferrari but it's k LOL

good luck on your day man
Wonder what Cathie is thinking about her Z play right now.
she belongs here lol she bought the top and sold the bottom

Fuck u DraftKings. Never using ur shitty service again hope u fucking go bankrupt
Just sold my NVDA calls for a massive gain üòÅüëç

Still red for the day because of bitch boy MRNA üò≠üëé
God damn I sold my NVDA calls way too early
NVDA next Trilly for sure
You see something going up, you buy it then it dumps immediately. Fuk you F
Bruh you need to wait more than 10 minutes before you evaluate if your play was good or not.
FYI: if you see someone saying that a stock will moon because of a bullish pennant pattern in their TA, I want you all to know that the pennant has the LOWEST success rate out of all TA patterns. 54% success rate. Don‚Äôt get bamboozled by noob chart astrologers
Good call, nerd.
Still better than 50/50. I'm in.
I‚Äôm 300 dollars shy of being able to day trade
Deposit 300
I‚Äôd cashapp you if I could write it down as a loss on my taxes
That‚Äôs the sweetest thing someone has said to me this week
WSB: karma rich, money poor
too real üò©üò≠
Fucking lel OCGN CEO Shankar Musunuri sold the top again.
NVDA I luv u
TSLA is gonna give me a heart attack swinging my calls around like this
everything deep red except for fucking tesla man i don‚Äôt get it
Tech's brite green except for AAPL.
You do not have the retard powers then
Man taking an 11 dollar profit on those eod spy calls seemed dumb at the time
Cashed out 3.5k today good luck to you guys
TSLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Options are like that stupid fucking level on N64 pod racer. The one where you were in the sky and there were these two story cages and the minute you fell from the top to the bottom there was no recovering from last place. If you know you know
Star Wars pod racing, abyss track
About to take the urine std test.
puts on that
Lucky. I had to get a qtip shoved in my pee hole
I'm still up 500 on spy calls today,  but I was up a grand earlier. Guess I'll wait it out
Same, from up 1200 to currently up 300, dips happen tho
Pretty much same for me on the profit. I think she‚Äôs goin back up tho.
Hope so.  Mine are 11/19 465, so barring any stupid shit, I'll be alright. But still lol
Same bucket here. She‚Äôll go back up soon enough
My portfolio is bad and I feel sad
Load up on the TSLA dip
You guys ever have a position that you love and are long on and get mad when you see it constantly moon? Wtf are they doing to NVDA. Its not even earnings yet why are they pumping it. I'm never gonna sell but I feel they are overhyping earnings.
pricing in earnings probably, plus its a beast of a stock in the perfect scenario for them.
Go back and look at NVDA the three weeks prior to every earnings this year.
No :)
SAVA lets gooooo, 100+ incoming

Massive dick energy
I sold 20 265 NVDA weeklies yesterday at close‚Ä¶. Pain

What‚Äôd you roll into? I bought a few 1200 11/12 TSLA calls‚Ä¶ holdn
i panic sold the 270s because they dipped bad and i'm a coward, bought tsla 1250c's and sold right before close for a decent profit, bought them again this morning now stressing about them the way that shit is bouncing today. i am a day trade addict, if i just fucking held now and then i'd be rich
F
Ouch

If you change your question to ‚Äúwithin the hour‚Äù - yes
Lol apparently
Jesus Christ. Nvidia is nearing 100 bagger
Jeez NVDA wtf

OCGN says 'hold my beer'
One rises, another falls
that's an oof
That's been happening since forever. The top gaining stock of the day/week is usually some bio company. But today's top gainers are usually tomorrow's top losers.

Everyone, I want to let you know to buy puts on NVDA as I will go into calls now thanks. By 3 pm today I need you guys to give me a play because most likely this will fall and will be close to being broke.
That's my baby NVDA, nice rebound
I started this new thing where I buy shares and my mental has been great
Seems like a really good time to buy.
If you ever see a bubble, ride it. You‚Äôll make more risking it than if you cry about it on the sidelines. If you lose your shirt, post it here though üòÇ

Yes

Wow I paper handed NVDA
The smart play would be to sell my Nov 5 nvda calls but I‚Äôll probably hold you like the smooth brain I am
Roll them out jic
Jesus fucking christ NVDA $285 FDs closed at $12 a pop yesterday. $12 fucking dollars, those suckers are at $1,500 right now
If mrna is at 190 by 2pm I‚Äôll rip my cock off
NVDA is up 50% the last 30 days
So is my dick
only 50?
So glad I got into NVDA yesterday perfect timing
Same for me: AMD this morning
tesla formed its logo on the daily
Bullish af‚Ä¶ again
Bears trying to stay hard looking at the VIX all day hoping for a drop that lasts 10 secs so they can cum, only for us to go green again
Fuck working, who needs a job when we have JPow
Lmao $GME could go to $1000 and those stupid bagholders wouldnt sell until its back to $150 again
They would buy more
GME holders aren't selling till $0

No more PDT restrictions. Let‚Äôs not fuck it up like the previous 2-3 times.
Gotta get those quick scalps bro
Will try this time.
Just wait for fake dips to bounce off the floor of VWAP. Pretty safe if there‚Äôs no bad catalyst.
TSLA please go up for my fish
Sold.. happy with my current gains 

Love you NVDA
#GRAB EM NET PTON PUTS BOYS FOR THAT 5 BAGGER TOMORROW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why is the fucking IV so high on these??
BB needs a name change desperately. I'm confident that'll solve all my problems holding these bags.
Bagholders 'R' Us?
BETA
Lot of folks around here are too young to remember that they used to be called $RIMMjob.
Yeah Rimjob was 160/share + bid to bring a 2nd NHL team to Southern Ontario. Felt great.
I can smoke two packs a day now that NVDA cured cancer.
Once TSLA reaches $1337, elon will send out a tweet 'lol 1337 dude' sending the stock up to $1420.69 in which he will then tweet 'thinking of taking Tesla private at $1420.69 a share.'   


GET IN NOW!!!! $1420c 11/12
Of all the possible timelines, we're so lucky to have this one.
NVDA really still going up huh. fuck everyone who got 300c. i am ENVIOUS. the jealousy is boiling thru my blood
I've got one 300c. Wish I had 10.
fucking same
Fuck you, Passport out of date, couldn't open Options account 2 weeks ago.
I got a 272.5 call. Felt alright.
Is TSLA gonna just burn calls and puts till Friday close üòí
Max pain baby
NVDA added 150B market cap today on one price upgrade this morning from Summit Insights? How soon will NVDA hit 1T at moment its only $60ish away stock wise from 1T.
It literally has been going up 4% everyday for 60 days
Lol NVDA $300 calls up over 20,000%. Can you imagine
did NVDA cure cancer today?
My mood at work is directly correlated to how my portfolio is doing. 

Red weeks: *(This place is so fucking shitty. I fantasize about wrapping my car around a tree before pulling into the parking lot just so I don't have to go in. Maybe I'll just burn it down myself so nobody has to go in ever again)*


Green weeks: *"Stacey that is hilarious about your toddler. And I would love to see the pics of what you dressed your dog for Halloween as. I'll have those reports finished today boss happy to do it. Hey gang let's go grab lunch! I love this place!"*
fuck sold my 260/265 nvda calls too early this morning, probably left 3 stacks on the table ughh
Lol I sold my 220‚Äôs for 100% gain two weeks ago
Bet you felt pretty good about it too huh? Try to remember that.
With my track record anytime I make any money I‚Äôm happy
PTON I‚Äôll see you at $75 tomorrow morning
Bad guidance priced in
Nah
If you're not cultivating desert power, what the fuck are you even doing?
Trippin balls off spice I guess
Nvda added $100,000,000,000 to market cap today. That‚Äôs a lot of video cards.
All this nvda euphoria is making me scared? Puts for tomorrow?
I‚Äôm buying some qqq puts. My mind just can‚Äôt understand this.
QCOM basically said they figured out how to navigate the supply chain disruptions. So I guess people are hoping NVDA can do the same?
Omg NVDA on steroids jfc
Did someone say steroids?
What we talking, some Tren?
Nvidia definitely on the juice of the gods today
On fucking T. rex hormones
Ah yes NVDA at 5x AMD's market cap. Very normal
AMD is at 137.60

itll fly on monday with the merger. AMD wouldnt be doing their presentation expo otherwise.
137.80 sorry
Similar forward PE, AMD much slower growth
Sold Nvda calls and dumped them into fb 340c 1dte üò¨
The next logical move in this market is PLTR going to $80
Do we hold NVDA till tomorrow?!
I am cause I can‚Äôt sell none of mine until tomorrow
I don‚Äôt understand how stocks can run so much in 1 day. I guess I have a lot to learn...
I did zero work today. I watched nvidia all day
made more on NVDA today than the richest brain surgeon makes in a week sheeeesh
Watched it all day and didn‚Äôt open a position‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm so sorry
that's cool. my co-workers are on tinder all day
bought nvidia calls
What stile and expiration?
Lol doesn't matter everything is printing
11/5 $310
NVDA making people fucking rich on a Thursday
The new TSLA.  Getting some FOMO here pushing it up.
#WE'RE ALL GETTING BEAR SKIN RUGS FOR OUR MANSIONS AFTER THIS BEAR EXTERMINATION
I actually have a bear skin rug in my den and I have a gold bull statuette on the fireplace mantle. Fuck bears to death!!!
Imagine buying a rug when you're already standing on one
Can‚Äôt believe I caught this NVDA run
Well, that's it for me boys. NVDA call credit spreads wiped me out good. Rest of my money is for boring investing. Ill be back when I get my next paycheck!
#F
A quick 25% on my calls in 10 minutes. Ty AFRM
Nvda has no chill
He is here to make bers go extinct

Selllllll
I buy NVDA calls 1-2 times a month but I don't have any today :(
NVDA has trancended to god tier stonk
Holy shit NVDA I actually sold at the top for once
How rich are you now
Bought at 990 a contract, sold at 5000
I‚Äôm so sick of the fuckin PDT rule. It literally keeps me from taking profits. Woulda been over that bullshit 25k minimum too if I coulda sold
Then break it if you were going to be over $25k, it‚Äôll lift the next day
Yeah but then I risk another stock in my portfolio dumping and I open up tomorrow below 25k and I‚Äôm fucked
You know if you sat over the 25k and let a trading session pass over you would‚Äôve been able to trade again the next day right
Same bro it SUCKS
LMAO this just in FB tried to buy the rights to the name Meta from another company with the same name.  They are now gonna sue get fukt.
Dude what the fuck. I had a dream last night Facebook were going after a company that had METAL in their name and wanted to sue them ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
I just saw the cease and desist letter from the company who said FB lawyers are hounding them and trying to bury them in the media.
NVDA had to cool off for the AH run up
TSLA is currently $6,200 a share before the split last yr
Entire market seems to be dumping
NVDA BACK FROM LUNCH
So I guess NVDA calls were the move?
They still are
Am I actually going to lose money on TSLA calls? Fuuuck.
You deserve it... Buying TSLA calls after a +60% run up in 4 weeks... takes a special kind of retard to do that.
Show me on the doll where Elon touched you.
Elon's sure been tweeting a lot today. Must be taking a lot of shits. He himself adds +25% volatility you forget to factor that in often.
Elon for prison 2021
2021 almost over bro
If you made money today, give yourself a Pat on the back
NVDA just made me fail NNN
Hulk dick on AMD, bloody tampon on ROKU. About time I got it right!
holding paypal for dear life wtf is this shit
I‚Äôm buying more if it goes to 215 and again at 200. Free money with shares for the long haul
Oh god what happened to paypal
Dammit SPY can you just go up for 30mins, and quit jumping around like a three legged dog.
Meme stoks got bullied today.
Happy with my AMD & NVDA gains. Done for the week
Happy with gains? Done for week?
I don‚Äôt understand.
Gains???? Wtf are those???
Still don‚Äôt know what to do with my Tesla calls
Hold the line‚Ä¶
*tries to check burry‚Äôs twitter*

‚ÄúSomething went wrong.‚Äù

*Sounds about right.*
The strength of tech right now is so nuts to me
Tech is insensitive to labor, and labor is a big question mark right now - what will it cost, will it show up to work, will it make us need lots of attorneys.
$AMD still got room to run ?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
I just bought calls expiring tomorrow so it better
I did my move today. Lost $7K at BBBY. Tomorrow I'll come back for more. It's like an addiction. I like it more than when I make money at this point. I guess I'm in paradox.
I‚Äôm still holding BBBY. Don‚Äôt give up, this baby is going up to $60
Remember, remember the 5th of November. BBBY is going to the moon. Will be the fuse that lights the meme stock rocket!
'like' an addiction
> I like it more than when I make money at this point. I guess I'm in paradox.

thats because you like the comeback story. im the same way
This. I was down at roulette $9K in Vegas on Saturday night. Next morning I did a comeback with my last $500 and left with $10K. Love that fucking adrenaline.
playing options or lost it on shares?
Shares. Bought at $26 yesterday
What a ride Nvidia gave us today.
Up 45% on my AMD shares üòä

Supply chain bottlenecks were created by Fed policy because they have been the drivers of consumer demand increase.

Blaming supply chain issues as the cause of inflation is flat out ü§° and ignores the other half of the equation where you printed trillions to drive demand

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
The Fed will own it all
Don't forget the allocation of printed money to support stimulus and prevent evictions. People just started buying shit and downloading robinhood to trade memes lmao. And here we are. No one wants to work
Holding PTON puts through earnings, to those of you with calls, good luck on this fookin coin toss
To the folks downvoting me for mentioning nvda puts, thanks for the cash! GG
Spy orbital
Let's check the facts

-low interest rates everywhere (no "safe" places for money to go, nearly free money for every company out there)

-Every two weeks people make their 401K contributions to the market which they won't pull out until 59.5 (literally rigged to have much more buying than selling)

-FAANGM which has a hand in every aspect of our lives still around a 30 PE despite rapidly increasing profits

-The MF US government printing money every day to make sure the market doesn't fall

Yeah bears, we're going down ü§°
You forgot one thing: massive inflation.
Inflation has helped the market go logarithmic in the long term

When your dollars are worth less every day you certainly don't want to be holding cash
biggest threat is millenials reaching peak economic value in 2035
LOL bro seriously TLDR downvoted

Yall ever played something perfectly? Like Z puts printed huge yesterday. Sold half at 300%, bought some calls around 2. Now, if Z opened where it currently is. My 65 calls are ITM and my 70p are ITM .

Need to turn my next paycheck into 50k to save my losses
Doable if your paycheck pays you 40k.
Not even a 10th of that
4k every 2 weeks is actually pretty good tho.

Alright I can‚Äôt ignore nvidia anymore it just hasn‚Äôt gone down
Today I‚Äôm actually going to learn how options work, I swear.
So what is a theta decimal move against rho within a strike above a 1.02 rate ?
YouTube is your friend. I like Sky View Trading and Black Girl Stocks, both have very simple breakdowns.
Peloton worth buying some puts for? Seems dogshit still
Been holding these otm tesla calls and I‚Äôve seen it almost go down to 100% loss and slowly climbing back up now I hope diamond hands pay off tomorrow
Day trading Tesla calls is free money.

shhhh, just go with the flow, dont jinx it!
I keep waiting for a nvda buying opportunity but the shit won‚Äôt stop mooning
Buy the momentum
I thought that when I bought at 600 pre split
have to just bite the bullet
I know the feeling but managed to back up the truck in September.

I think you won‚Äôt get a chance to do that until a post earnings where it will pull back to 225 ish.
At some point, people will learn to not fight a meme, but the sheer insane amount of put buying/short selling on TSLA the past week is providing fuel for more upside.  It was running 40-45% puts; that's nuts.  Way too early on the short side of that trade.

People just gotta stop trying to short that and let it run until buyers run out of gas.

I have no idea how high TSLA can go, but there's just so much money flowing into calls there the past week or two that there's no case for a quick fall.
üíØüíØüíØ

I saw that 1 million short post and bought calls
It makes no sense man; the stock has insane buying pressure.  Just let it run until it blows off and the call buying slows.

Nobody can stop that stock when there's billions of dollars flowing into calls like that.
Can only lead a horse to water
Pre market is ROARING ü§ë
Nvda is the gift that keeps giving

NVDA $380C 12/17 a good idea? Like $50ish a pop

Why is it that every time news of Merck dumb pill comes out NVAX and its peers alike drop?!

Who the fuck is gonna take over 40 pills, which they have not released the side effects and worst yet will prob destroy ur liver et al... due to the mass amt of pills to take!?

EXPONENTIAL TECHNOLOGICAL GROWTH NOT EVEN PRICED IN, SPY 500 EOY
This bull is very strong . Going to need some real  bad news to kill it .
GM made Ford overtake them with the hype. They need new management.

Morons building big ass electric convertible roof SUVs. Only rappers gonna drive that fam
That the electric hummer?  Lol yeah. Instead of improving on the mass market EV Bolt, they decide to roll the dice on a six figure halo truck that will probably only compete with the rivian (and lose)

At least Ford is being proactive and going all in, GM is already behind and slipping further back by the month
Not sure why they didn't build something like the Lyriq first. A family friendly crossover everyone can buy. Their management is completely retarded
Right? So dumb, how does GM not realize their growth  and their base market is economy
That is true, that Ford was like, what works for tesla works for us and made a sports car.  

GM out here like hold my beer!!
Tesla you‚Äôre the only thing holding me together and the only thing tearing my apart DONT LET ME DOWN
Did BABA change their ER date? I thought it was today
I'm confused too. That's ok, that means more people will keep buying with the delay? lul
Will Microsoft hit 335 today?
Yes
I think so. Holding some $345 calls for 12/3 so I hope
We blowing up BB today?
Only thing I‚Äôm blowing up is this toilet rn
I hope. I have 13.5 calls
Z 65$ puts the play or nah?
nah the drill is over
So done with OCGN, can‚Äôt wait to sell at open
OCgn is a scam stock.
I'm trying to decide if I should hold a few months to sell at a lesser loss, or just dump that shit at open and lick my wounds for a bit.
Time value would say to dump it and use the money on a better play. However if you‚Äôre a regard like me, you‚Äôll just pick something else shitty. Might as well hold those bags for a while. Maybe it‚Äôll get some love sooner rather than later
There are more catalysts on the horizon, but after seeing how badly it's been beaten down on big positive news I'm not sure if this will get any traction going forward. Gonna see how far down I am at open and make an irrational decision then.
Who‚Äôs playing RKT earnings today?

SAVA WTF LOL
SAVA data review shows no manipulation.
I sold my nvda Nov calls for a $1600 loss a month ago ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°

Henry Ford invented the assembly line all those years ago just so I could get a 20 banger on a leap that I picked up on a whim in March of 2020 ü¶Ö üá∫üá∏
I was mulling around to buy F at 4-5$ a share early last year. I know my buddy did. I kept buying close to the money calls and expiring worthless then gave up. I wasn‚Äôt paying much though as I was just learning about options.
I'd rather have a 10 bagger on 200 $20 11/26c's
I TOLD YOU CUCKS TO BELIEVE IN SAVA
I bought some. Now I am regretting not buying more!
I locked in with 245 shares for months now, got it to sub 60 cost average.
How the fuck is no one talking about NVDA? 

Did I board this rocket alone?
All of us NVDA bulls are jacking off rn sorry brb
Put my last $100 into calls this morning. Up 150% lol

Keep running NIO, Sofi and chargepoint. I want my monthly tendies
SAVA edging to 100
SPY TO 470 BY LUNCH
So TSLA keeps going up yet my TSLA calls are losing money ? IV crush ? Anyone ?
Looks like IV is higher. Time decay? How far out of the money are you?
The call is for $1265 for tomorrow
Yeah that‚Äôs why. You‚Äôre not in the money so you‚Äôre seeing time decay. Go use an options calculator off google and it‚Äôll show you how the pricing will move with stock price change!
Thank you I really appreciate the explanation if I had an award to give you‚Äôd have it
Theta is rough on a Thursday FD
SAVA is ripping on a peer review stating that data was not manipulated, as suggested by bs hedge funds.

Calls?
shares
Paperhanded my spy calls this morning. Fuk
Lol me too
If you get that urge do it. Nothing wrong with it. Its incredibly hard to time the top. Im more often always glad i sold and took profits than holding and me going over the top.

Also, sell calls.. take out 3/4 and buy 1/4 of it and buy weeks later on an OTM call. So you can still gain.

Fuck spy why are you tanking now
Because I just bought 12/31 475c
SPY what is you doing
How fucked up would it be to see SPY tank the day *after* that guy lost his money/home/wife?
I firmly believe MM and other big investors get off on this shit and would not be surprised
Usually how it works
Got a link to that story handy?
Just check "misterragerz" and scroll down then work your way up to see the meltdown lol
Damn at least I feel better about myself and my life now.
So you're saying you're not going to take out a loan on your home and buy some short expiry puts on a a major index that's raging unchecked all without telling your wife?

Wow good luck retiring early with that kinda risk tolerance bro

Anyone who has been here longer than a year and is still here has lost more than enough to offset their gains

I can teach you, but I have to charge
Question: NVDA has calls up over 2000% today. Can you even sell that?
If I‚Äôm up bigly I have no problem slapping the bid if spreads are shit anyways
> I can't tell you whether to buy or sell, but I do know that the stock market is a gamble.
nothing really matters
Are spy 12/31 500c  retared ?
Logically yes, but in the current market‚Ä¶
I'm holding some.  I don't think they're dumb.  Mine are already up 40%
Very, I don't think there will be a big down period till end of year but I think it's going to settle down a bit after this week (TSLA + FOMC stuff made this week a bit hectic)
I have literally never lost money betting on NVDA in my 2 years of retard trading
It had a run up 1 week before and after GTC last year, GTC this year is Nov 9th and it's on a run.....
Just buy stock or leaps and never look at it
I would like to resume mooning now.

why don't i just buy calls on every Nancy stock  üòûüòû
Any SPY dip for the past month just gets bought up almost instantly
You have to have some major balls to be buying/holding TSLA here...
I have big balls
My Jan puts are up even though the stock is up‚Ä¶ gotta love IV
Yeah. People are going to get hurt. I hope not but probability is high.
You‚Äôve probably been saying this for two years now.
tbh i won't touch it, but i think it will consolidate for a while then start jumping again.
Printer unjammed
Nvidia is the new Spy
NVDA $300 today?? I think I'm getting hard

how the fuck am I going to get rich if Wells Fargo Auto wants me to make a $10k down payment on my Model Y? I'm trying to finance that whole fucking thing at 2.5% so I can keep my money in TSLA and the bank can suck my nuts from inflation
the euphoria should scare you
It's been this way for months and just keeps getting more insane
PENN is getting beat up after earnings. Makes me second guess picking up DKNG calls right here. Gonna do it anyway
Just bought penn calls for June ‚úÖ
I think it hit its low, I could be wrong tho :)
Someone open up the gate, gme is ready to run
Volume is so low tho....?
Oh yes NVDA I‚Äôm gonna blow
What a day. NVDA pops 11% and the pound crashes so I make profit on the fx at the same time.
SPY 420 Puts EOM if you wanna lose everything you own

I think stock market is broken. They need an update or smth.
Imagine not wanting easy money with Ford, AMZN, and SOFI.

Rivian is a quadruple cannon and is going to send them to ATH next week

Loaded up to the tits with calls on F, AMZN, SOFI and they treating me like a king

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Sold my F calls this morning for a fat profit then entered again when it dipped. Actually sold the top and bought the bottom üò≠maybe I'm not so retarded after all
Congrats bro I was going to do the same but i bought them cheap af anyway so i held on for fatter ROI next week theyre going to pop bigly
Which Sofi calls did you load? I have some already but thinking about adding more
Thank you NVDA and SAVA
Lemme see that gain porn

Watch it open at 100B
100T
Special access on SoFi for shares at IPO price
What is SoFi?
A brokerage type thing
?  So can anyone get into it?
Yeah its like robinhood. You gotta make an account tho. Hopefully they still have ipo shares available tho. Might be sold out. Id check first.
> Shares of Nvidia Corp. are on track for their largest single-day percentage gain in nearly 19 months as optimism builds for the company‚Äôs annual GTC developer conference that could highlight opportunities within the hot ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù theme.

Okay, I'm officially a boomer. Wtf is that statement.
They making some chips for AR headsets or some shit
1. The "metaverse" will need a lot of graphics rendering power. Nvidia has been talking about this for a while.
2. The "metaverse" will heavily rely on a diverse set of statistical and computational techniques (AKA AI) to generate content.
3. Nvidia makes the chips and software to enable this.
Yes, I get the tech, I just mean from a 'wtf people actually think we are going to be spending a significant portion of time in VR?" perspective
I know, it sounds crazy!! I do think there is a legit reason to believe it might be the case. We already spend a huge amount of time interacting with a computer. That interaction has remain pretty much the same since the introduction of the PC, that is, there is a screen and we watch it, giving it inputs with, a mouse at the beginning, and then our fingers.  
Companies like Meta and Nvidia really think they can provide a different way of providing this interaction. Right now the products look dumb as hell, nobody wants to be wearing a headset more than 20 minutes. It was the same when the mouse, and the graphical user interface was invented, people legit though it was dumb as hell. Until Gates and Jobs created products that made it cool.  
Will Huang and Zuckercock make VR the new normal way of interacting with computers? Maybe, maybe not. They do have some deep pockets to make it happen.

It is a great price, bulls are being sweated. Buying here is very solid
Yea I'm picking up and adding to my long term positions.  I think patience pays on this.
PayPal should reach 500 by 2024 at the latest

Everything is worth more than prepandemic
Not V apparently
Really getting a DKNG today ü•¥
PaperHands Portnoy and $PENN just wiped out the last years worth of gains. down 18% today. Yikessss!

dudes choking and slamming 19 year old hoors...Yep he's what we all wish we were, living the WSB Degen dream. /s
damn i didnt read into it.

yeah uh no thanks
This is nothing new for him though. His old sex tape shows bondage and choking as well.
ahh okay didnt even know he has a sex tape around
So Tesla‚Äôs chart is making a Tesla symbol
I started a new job recently that pays a lot more but I forgot I had automated 75% of my work over 5 years and now I don't have time to make degenerate money losing bets on the market anymore.  üò§.
that's what bathroom breaks are for.
It usually takes me a couple hours to commit to losing money tbh.  I can't shit for that long.
Lmao perhaps my great grand kids will be able to buy NVDA on the dip one day.
I have like 40 positions but not a single one is NVDA üò≠
tfw u buy only one nvidia contract ü•∫

Weird
AMD and SPY are literally money printers.
why is NVDA pumping? also why is VXX pumping?
vix: üìà

Productivity down 5%....labor cost up 8+%....prob nothing keep shuffling titanic chairs.

For every gf/ wife who wanted a pton and never used it, tonight‚Äôs earnings is for you!
Puts on used bikes?
Anyone playing COIN earnings? My thought is Calls so I kinda want to inverse my thought for profit.
Holding through earnings, banking on retarded crapto frenzy in winter.  Up 300% so far, trimming jan calls and sticking  some on earnings instead. Really hoping the market doesn‚Äôt take any bearish words too hard, or a poor quarter, so long as corn keeps running coin is in for a lot of action in the winter.
1240 resistance swinging its dick around

It‚Äôs literally only up for 3 months
i like day trade gambling
Puts on MCD. Just got back to work from getting food. They gave me my McDouble/small fry combo, my drink, and the ranch for my 10 piece nuggets. Except they gave me a fucking McRib instead of nuggets... no wonder my truck smelled like barbecue on the drive back to work
Internationally they‚Äôre making hella bank though
If you bought PENN after paper hand portnoy shit the bed on his meme stocks, you kinda deserve it. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Dave P. is going to be saying ‚ÄúOne bag, everybody knows the rule‚Äù
PENN puts are fucking chugging

It's free money
DKNG is Dicking me. I should have known better. Good news comes out today and it still plunges more.
Give it time, people are associating DKNG with PENN because they're stupid. I bought end of month puts on PENN and calls on DKNG
waiting for a dip in NVDA to load up on calls again.
Any Visa/MasterCard bulls here? I just need yall to tell me this is only temporary lol
My mom just put like 300k in it and my bro put in another 25k

This was at $209
Sold my V calls this morning
Visa bull here holding calls, it is temporary there‚Äôs nothing wrong with visas growth track. This is where you buy, visa will do even better during the rate hikes in the future. They make more money when rates are higher
Yea I just see the bear case of BNPL hurting them and mobile pay like WeChat pay etc will take a huge portion of their business. I had sold $215 Puts and they expire tomorrow, I guess I will roll them out a few more weeks
Theta Gang day
not for big tech lol
Ye I was talking about SPY üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Who knew going all in on Ford when it was like $7 would‚Äôve been the play. Who knew getting rid of dividends would pay off so good üòä
I legit thought the company was going bankrupt. This analyst at my old job said it was a buy
Yeah they have such good warranties,(service) lose money on a lot government deals, and they were hugely in debt‚Ä¶ but now they are doing the evs and getting into more innovation. So it‚Äôs looking much better
I say you are right, although I never owned a Ford. Congrats on your gains
I sold my 2022 calls a little early lol but avg cost of shares like $13 thanks
they got rid of dividends? why nobody posted about that here?
They did it a while ago
Come on NVDA massive push through 300 üöÄüöÄüöÄ

So I‚Äôm a relatively new trader, but I‚Äôm also an impatient bastard, so I want to make a play on earnings reports tomorrow. I saw that Draft Kings ($DKNG) was expected to have a 75% increase in revenue, yet their stock is down. I was thinking of buying calls today and letting them sit until tomorrow. Does anyone have any other information or advice so that I don‚Äôt lose my entire account?
Yeah....about that...
You are about to find out about IV real quick sweet heart
Penn missed bad
Well I know that PENN missed badly and that‚Äôs why the stock is down, but what does that have to do with Draft King‚Äôs earnings
Yeah because DKNG took all the market share this is like intel and AMD
Doubt it, there's like a million new sports betting apps now.
Not sure if this helps much but with mobile sports gambling recently legalized where i live, I've used about 5 different betting apps to get various promos. DKNG has by far the best UI and variety of bets, and literally everyone I know is sports betting, especially with football season.
Better off finding a company in a good uptrend with relatively low IV and buying 60dte calls close to the money. Not as exciting but nowhere near as risky.
Look at the earnings thread pinned here - it shows the likely window for earnings swings. You should know that it can go either way and the market has been funny so there is no guarantee.
Their peer PENN reported earnings and tanked.  So who knows but the whole sector might be soft.
The only advice I have is to not play earnings with options.  You may win a couple, but you'll get screwed eventually.  Best to stick to more predictable plays.
Last week I went from 8k to 16k 
So far this week I went from 16k to 24k holy shit
Did you sell yet
Nope. I‚Äôm still in with 20k and little cash
I have a lot of calls and picked up some shares of some stocks. I‚Äôll probably sell tomorrow
This month (past 30 days) I went from 4.5 to 33k. Thank you Costco and lending club.
Costco is a fucking beast
Dude, no lie. Such a juggernaut, and IV is actually super manageable so you can get reasonable calls with some decent time till expiry. Just took profit and will look to rebuy on some weakness. Cant hold they an almost 4% day and not expect some profit taking.
Investing in 2021 is cool cause even the world's biggest companies move like penny stocks
ü§£ü§£ü§£
GME....cmon....lets pick it up
Someone give me a play that will have me either working at Wendy‚Äôs, or purchasing a Wendy‚Äôs

I‚Äôve lost so much money this week not trusting my instincts so fuck it. All in on Jan 45‚Äôs
Kyler Quinn
It's been shitting for . months
Gone like Donkey Kong
Trying to parlay 6 inverse decisions to figure out what to do
Man WSB is making loads of money today.
I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm the idiot who bought BP post earnings thinking it was a sure thing
I'm making money on my AMD and TSM long positions; AMD is at ATH, my account also at ATH.

FYI Last time this happened whole market crashed.
NVDA wont stop till its 1trillion company
lmaooooo Elon, tweeted #hype, its time to go  BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
This time last year, tsm ran from 80-140 from November to February. Now I ain‚Äôt saying it could happen again but what if.... #TSM
It should run it‚Äôs fair value is in the 140s and it‚Äôs will be in the 160s after next earnings
After the rub tub it‚Äôs given all year and all the chip demand, I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt. Hoping
SOXL has my pecker harder than a diamond
FB gonna be next to surge on NVDA rise in value.
FB undervalued but I want it to tank so I can buy more
I didn't notice AMD was running up too
Fukin NVDa. Can someone who knows maths tell me how much it added to its cap today?
> 14.4 million dollars
Are you a human or a bot?
Over 70 billion
Tempted to sell SAVA now but it was at $135 in the summer. Still lots of room to move
Same i have 10 calls and 150 shares but im gonna hold see how it looks tomorrow
Sitting on it till at least November 8. No way of knowing how high it can run on good news.
not making money and too late to FOMO in. This is so depressing
Why the hype over metaverse? Seems like they just slapped a catchy, "techy" name on a simple concept and that's enough to hype nvda 100b???
meta is so fucking dumb.  didn't we try this shit like ten years ago with "second life" and all that dumb shit?
Did Xbox kinda have a metaverse?
I think you're talking about r/outside
TSLA added 300 billion market on news of a 4 billion dollar order from HTZ, with a contract thats not even signed, and elon even admitting that this doesnt even affect their deliveries or change anything for them since they have a supply problem not a demand one

NVDA blowing up 100 billion off of stupid as shit news isn't that crazy in this environment
The pigs are about to get slaughtered....
Exactly‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt have to make sense.
anyone loaded on NET puts for earnings?
I got a few. Expecting a bloodbath.
Yeah. I no longer believe stocks actually go up after earnings.
Where is the Nio love during this  bull run. Has wsb abandoned us?
Nio ‚ù§Ô∏è
Nah the racist bears just don‚Äôt want to give up but they are about to suffer the same fate as Tesla bears
I just want to be rich and marry a model. Is that too much to ask?
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre asking enough tbh
Worked for me
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
With so many calls ITM. will NVDA continue pump tomorrow?
The million dollar question!
Never seen nvda move like that
I'm up $22k in a week (from $7k to $28k) and part of me wants to take a break and think hard but mostly don't want to miss out FOMO YOLO BRRRRRRR

Edit: make that $24k üò≥

Edit: make that $18k
Make sure to breathe and remember you can lose it even faster, so stay smart.
DKNG coiling up
It‚Äôs about damn time üòÜ
NVDA PLZ CHILL
Woah NVDA is meme stocking
I'm eating good . NVDA, SAVA, CAR solid week
Everyone get in Nvidia right the fuck now
This comment perfectly caught the massive red candle, thanks
If you were late that's on you. üòé
I know millionaires were made today. Gain porn will be legendary.
Ok AMD wtf is going on...
In the future we will only need semiconductors and GPUs
and rental cars
I know if I buy nvda it will fly straight into the toilet.
Fax
I thought the same lol
NVDA $500 tomorrow

BIGLY full retard market
Never again will I FOMO into amd calls
Power hour? No. Power dump!
Got an NVDA put just started making money. Puts hit different.
NVDA FROM THE TOP ROPE
Lmao
I hate it. Market at ATH, missed out on TSLa train, unable to fill SAVA 200c 1/23 on Monday because ask was .20 over bid, and I‚Äôm here sitting with $50k worth meme stonks with only +7% all time. Massive fuk
nvda bruh
A massive whale purchased 1375c for Tesla expiring tomorrow.

Ready for the 15:30 Eastern Standard Time. Earnings will be released and we will moon!!
Or we will dump, 50-50 really... :D
Time to commit toaster bathtub?
If you're a bear, maybe. I made the mistake of buying SPY puts yesterday before the Fed meeting. Never again; calls for life.
Some dude bet his house mortgage on SPY puts yesterday lol
if nvda bounces back by eod i will cry tears of retard joy
every fucking play is wrong
DIS double hammers on the daily.
Come nvda you beautiful bitch
Should I dump my nvda profits into AMD December calls? Do we know when acquisition is coming?
All in on ABNB. This btch is going to Mars with Elon
so now that I can day trade I'm losing a ton of money reacting too quickly, which was one of the benefits I was looking forward to. I just can't win
Daytrading is just learning how to find patterns and be emotionless.
Okay enough with NVDA. 

SOMEONE GIVE ME THE EEARNINGS PLAY. NAME THE STOCK AND UPPIES OR DOWNIES

I‚Äôve been wondering that everyday for the past month.
Lowest it can possibly go is 200. 225 was more than good enough for me to reload
People have been calling the bottom for weeks now but if SQ numbers are good, I assume it will rise in anticipation of ER next week
I bought today. So no.
Donkeykong and SPY calls before close I guess
Should I buy more FB
Hold or sell my NVDA calls????
Sell
Sell
Roll up
i would‚Äôve sold an hour ago lmao fuck being a poor with PDT
I'm ready and willing to get cucked by $RKT for the seventh time.
TSLA- I'm gonna need you to keep doing what you're doing.  I'm almost there....
Go up? Yeah!
RKT earnings on deck. Ready to go
Got a 16.5 put for funzies

So it turns out HOMOSEXUALS *AREN‚ÄôT* GAY

At least according to reddit and the 7 day ban I just had‚Ä¶
Reddit is such a leftist shithole that you will get banned for calling a homosexual gay as if gay is a derogatory term. We‚Äôre full circle.
It's time to end cancel culture 

Time's up, mother fuckers

Also, earth is infact flat
Sold my NVDA calls at 9:45 this AM.

Currently looking for the highest bridge to jump off of.
just buy in again, we still have 2 weeks before ER so even more potential to PUMP
Take your NVDA profits people. 50% run up in a month is more than you could have ever asked for
 Can go higher üò™
Nvidia even seems overvalued at $200 tbh.

That means 500 eoy
NVIDIA like what the fuck. How are we not in a bubble
They're doing great things over there, you should see the things they're doing
sarcasm right?
Trump is that you?
They do the best things
Just a reminder that Tesla had 38 Billion in shorts on it before the run up. The largest short position in the history of the stock market. Not to mention that if Tesla gets one more credit upgrade Mutual Funds will be able to purchase it at investment grade credit levels.
Real question. I have a Vanguard with a bunch of TSLA in it. So they are already putting it in a fund. What do you mean by investment grade credit level?
They could potentially add Tesla individually to funds that require having investment grade credit. So basically the safest sort of pension type funds. Investment grade credit is basically the best credit rating level a company can have which basically just means a very low chance of default. Because Tesla has 15 Billion in cash and paid off a large portion of short term debt there is a good chance they will be upgraded again and become investment grade. It also means Tesla can issue bonds at the lowest rates possible which means they dont pay a lot of interest on debt.
Or some WSB retard is running your fund
> The largest short position in the history of the stock market

bers getting shot on sight, it wouldn't have gotten this valuation if Tesla short weren't this stubborn
Actually they would. The valuation is fine.
I keep seeing people say this but how do you believe it? It‚Äôs larger than basically every car manufacturer combined. And don‚Äôt even say ‚ÄútEsLa iSnT a cAr MaNuFaCureR‚Äù
Its through some of the fundamentals of the company. It is kind of obfuscated but there are some small details people miss in the financials that have to do with comps. Tesla is a car manufacturer and a very efficient one.
I‚Äôm all in on Tesla but this is retarded. So efficient that it‚Äôs worth more than every car company ever combined. OKAY lmao
An entire day of power hour

Bro no joke once I started getting into this market gambling shit I naturally wake up at 8 now like I could get 3 hours of sleep and I'll be up at 8 fucking wack
this is much preferable compared to when i was a baker and would be up before the sun even in my off days
That's fair and TBH this market shit is so much fun it's worth it lol
Just wait, soon you'll wake up in time for pre-market.
Got into the shower at +300, got out and saw +1100

Fuck yeah, hygiene
You should shower more
Ugh mom you shouldnt be on reddit
Waiting for TSLA to drop is like waiting for the sexy female friend you have chemistry with to leave her db boyfriend who everyone knows is cheating on her.
God damn I'm glad I have nvda shares and leaps. Some fucking moron last week was bitching how nvda is dogshit. I'ma find the comment and tag him lmfao
/u/nastygirl2020 still hate free money or?
Stupid me was satisfied with a 320% return on NVDA calls.  At over over $300 now, that could have been a 500% return or more.
Profit is profit man
only in this sub you'll see shit like this
Yep.  Any day I can increase my portfolio by 18% is a great day.
Never look once you sell
Congrats. Profits never suck. A good trader is always racking the next play; rotate into that one. Repeat. Tendies.
Bought some TSLA and rolled the rest into SPY 12/31 calls.

IMHO the GME related üåΩ has more upside than the stock at this point, that's where my money is going.
Allbirds taught me a lot about the consumer market.     Do not underestimate the amount of money people are willing to pay to virtue signal.    Even if it means wearing very ugly shoes.

$BABA earnings?
10th
I have no idea when. Etrade said yesterday, everyone else said today and the website says nothing at all.
Damn, should i buy calls on $SQ that report after the close, or $baba that might not report today at all?
I have BABA calls that expire tomorrow. I am now worried they won't report in time. $SQ will likely report on schedule.
yeah, you are right

Only weak bulls or üåàüêª capitulating are.

We just had another record close on S&P marking the 60th this year, only 3 other times in History has that happened. Each time it has a 4 Year bull run began.

I‚Äôm keeping it as a reminder.
Nope it‚Äôs ded
Could skyrocket, could not.
I‚Äôm hoping for the former. Fomoed into some 11/5s yesterday at open. So dumb
"U.S. stock futures hover around records after calm reaction to Fed's taper plan"  


Not sure what markets MarketWatch has been watching but that reaction was anything but calm lol
When is tapering expected to start?
üòÇü§°üòÇ
End of month- so expect ‚Äútapering fears‚Äù to cycle back mid month. I‚Äôd suggest trading up till the 11th-12th
Calm means up, not down.
**I don‚Äôt even like football I just like spanking their asses after the game**

I put my money in the market after I detoxed myself from the bear narrative. The bear narrative makes sense, but you don't get prizes for being right. The point is to make money.
The bear narrative makes a lot of sense, but it requires people to try and time the market, which is easier said than done.

yeah i want nvda but fuck me if i can find a juicy dip somewhere
I keep rolling calendar spreads on NVDA thinking it's going to calm down and go sideways for at least a bit. Apparently it only goes up in large amounts.
what dates boii, i need a 10 baggie today
They're 11/12 and 3/18/22. IV is pretty stagnant even though it's up like $50 in the last week so you really only get the delta gains lol

Bought 11/11 NVDA 300C at open. Already up 50% but no day trades. NVDA pls keep flying till tomorrow at least

NVDA calls be printinggggg
SPY 500 EOW
NVDA wtf hahahaha
GME fucking drilling. Sheesh
NVDA is the best stonk ever
SAVA gang looks like our day has come. let's get this party started
SPY calls or you hate money retards, it's printing.
If you not in sq u ain't black
Very astute observation.  I am indeed white.
I can tell you are black in the inside
My cold dead heart is not the issue here.
If you‚Äôre not in SQ you ain‚Äôt money gang gang.
I‚Äôm in SQ since last week, so far disappointed
dwac buyers and bagholders watching the rest of the market go up like jon snow watching ramsay shoot Rickon with an arrow
I got 100 shares yesterday sub 60 and sold a 70 strike CC for like $400 easy fuckin money
nice -  you'd prob be banned from the sub for selling
It's easy money, sell a CC on a huge IV and buy jump and ride it down and buy back cheap
TSLA wants 1250 so bad!!!
patience, they will rotate
#Ban Bet Won

/u/grapeapehungry (1/0) made a bet that NVDA would go to 275.0 when it was 264.46 and it did, congrats gigabrain.
SAVA will be a beast in 1 min !!
Uh how'd you do that? Is there a buyout?
no data manipulation found in their prior results
Hnnnnng
Yo saw this and made a quit 3k thanks G
no worries 

make that money bro!!!
spy and tqqq just net me a paychecks + worth of money in less than a day. God bless JPow
Headline about NKLA says they basically planned on being fined by SEC. Up 7%. Lol
They have literally have nothing besides 3d renders lmao
And why should the number of cars, delivered by a car company, affect the valuation? EVs have no competition!
Who‚Äôs participating in the Rivian IPO next week? I can‚Äôt help but think this stock is gonna rocket, especially with as much investment they have from Amazon and Ford.

[Tesla bulls start sharpening blades]
I want to get in on it. How do I participate in the IPO?
Buy the stock at the open on whichever brokerage you use
But it‚Äôs already popped then no? I bought in on $ABNB at the actual IPO price but it involved a bunch of paperwork beforehand to fill out. Wasn‚Äôt sure how to do that for Rivian
I should rephrase, it‚Äôs not a true IPO, but rather the ‚Äúdebut‚Äù. When they formally debut (Tuesday I believe) you can purchase the Common Stock as soon as the bell rings. A few hours shortly after the debut you will see the results of the IPO and whether investors believe the stock is, or is not worth their valuation.

Here‚Äôs perspective: at the time of writing this, Tesla is worth 1.22T. Rivian is targeting a valuation above 60B. To remain conservative here, let‚Äôs say they hit 60B on the dot.

Therefore, Rivian is expected to price themselves out at roughly 5% of Tesla‚Äôs value‚Ä¶ seems very fair.
agreed. also i know they are on an insane tear in southern california on a hiring and construction frenzy. makes me very bullish
Exactly. Amazon with a 20% stake in the company as well as Ford with 12%. Bezos is pledging to turn Amazons fleet of vehicles to all-electric. Btw, Ford no longer defines themselves as an ‚Äúauto-maker‚Äù but rather a ‚Äútransportation‚Äù company. Big difference there.
after two weeks of shorting NET & SPY,  I have now bought calls

prepare for a bloodbath
Lmaoooo never short SPY PUSSY
SAVA just about the wildest shit ive ever seen, up and down 40% in minutes over multiple days
So SAVA is the play then
Sava doing what ocgn should be doing
Look at the Order book for it.  Going up to 150 next.
I have SAVA 60/62 call spread. Instrinsic value is $200 right? Currently at -1900 cus theres no asks for the call just wanna make sure im not dead
What the fuck just happened to sava
JPow to the rescue
Fomod into NVIDIA. Nice.
Hey! If you bought and held Ford 20 years ago you could finally sell at a profit.
Lol I remember someone laughing at me when i said SAVA 100 EOW üòéüòéüòé
!banbet Sava 100 1W
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/animositisomina35** bet **SAVA** goes from **56.9** to **100.0** before **2021-11-11 10:09:41.296267-04:00**
Maybe in 10 minutes at this rate
I think it already happened, at least according to the daily high.
Visa just paid off my credit card debt with weeklies
Calls on late rent notices
I just want F $20
I am so green on SAVA right now it's unreal. This is what I needed. My luck has been against me in all parts of my life the last week.
I bought at $100, rode it up to $130 and then the lawsuit and allegations of fraud hit. rode it and bought all the way down. I'm back in black for the first time in months with it. #feelsgoodman
really starting to think TSLA is made to bounce up and down to raise IV, good fucking lord. It just wont stop printing lmaooo
SAVA peer review found no evidence of data tampering. Damn did those calls print
puts on ALZ
This market is on fucking roids boys üöÄüöÄüöÄ
I got absolutely raped by GME's fat red candle up my ass.

Worst part is I thought I had a day trade left. I didn't.
Anybody have an opinion on how high NVDA will go?
Up
I wanna get 300c but this bull is cautious
She's gonna blow! spy looking like mt vasevius

So, 1200 the magic number where nobody wants to buy TSLA anymore?

I sold a 133 call on AMD expiring this Friday when it was sitting at 119 thinking there's no way it goes up there. Well, I am down 1000%. On the other hand, I had 10 AMD 119 calls that I bought on Monday for 180$ each, sold for 194$ each. Worth 1560$ each now.
I too fucked myself with the paper hands
Whoever suggested root as a good stock your mom is a hoe
Earnings are next week 

That suggestion was u/axemanfromMa
Ya it was wtf how did you know
We dm often
Neato well I only have like $200 into 11/19 and 12/17 $5c‚Äôs I would take a 5-10% gain I guess it‚Äôs more long term

Shorts gonna cover be patient
What is your SDC earnings play? I have 5 11/5 $6C.

You may laugh at TSLAs valuation, but NKLA is a $6 billion dollar company?  Gtfo
And it‚Äôs going higher
NKLA is actually legit
NKLA with 0 revenue this year is still a multi billion dollar company folks
And yet it‚Äôs going higher
The end is near and I'm going to have no money to make off of it
it would appear the market will literally just go wild with inflation until the day rates rise

then it will go down 20-30%

‚Äúmarket is forward looking‚Äù is kinda bullshit
I‚Äôve been saying this too!!!  Forward looking is TOTAL bullshit for the exact reason you just said. Market is literally looking at just today and right this second right now. That‚Äôs it.
How are you guys down today? I'm not doing too bad. Green for the day
I'm up 20%! ü§™
I‚Äôm down because my hedge position is WAY to leveraged in options
literally everything i own is green
NVDA gains making up for my dumbass Chegg play.
sheesh, out of sava, probably missing the true parabola but cant just look a 5 bag in the face and not take that cash
One of my holdings made it to #2 in national market losers today. I'm so proud
SAVA is gonna make me a CASANOVA soon..
Tired of this market being so manipulated, it's insane SPY isn't above $470 yet
I'm tired of manipulation, give me more manipulation!

TSLA bers are sooo fuk
They say you can‚Äôt lose money in this market, but what if I‚Äôm holding sq roku pypl DKNG and penn and decided to sell my amd Etsy and TSLA? ü§°ü§°
Add VIAC and you have them all!
I just bought way more sq today
Good luck, it‚Äôs been so flat lately
I wish it was flat, it's been going down
Thought I was smart selling my AMD calls for 25% gain yesterday before close. Up 100% already today. F
bro i panic day traded NVDA 270c 11/5 for a LOSS yesterday, there's always someone more retarded than you
I was down on that call almost 65% last week, so seeing it up just got the best of me
Profit is profit.
This is true. My plan was to roll it into a later dated call after a morning dip that never came
Just bought 5 BB calls for tomorrow.... so lets do that.
ThE fEd SoLd ThE ToP!!!!!
They just pumping it one more time so they can say they didn‚Äôt sell the top
Buy TQQQ at all time high? This is fucking ridiculous
Fomo‚Äôd into more shares yesterday, my previous average was like $125. No regrets so far.
Man I really Wana get into DKNG

Nope, sold TESLA puts, free money
It's crazy the ones on both sides for that ticker that still fill. You can sell 1700s right now expiring tomorrow for $10 a pop, and people still buy. Just sell a few hundred of them and call it a day.
Can confirm.  Sold $265 CC on $COIN
I‚Äôm fucking done. I know as soon as I buy in it will be the top for SPY.
Well, yeah bro. Look at the tear it was on. You bought it like up 5.00 in one day. Look at the chart. How often is it doing that. You gotta wait to buy a dip or something lol

Considering they‚Äôre getting really close to their daily average (10M units so far with an average close to 12M), lots of algorithms will pick it up soon.

Tesla needs to hit 1250 and breakout
Damn the damage on DKNG is for real. Wall St acting like the company is folding. As if mfers aren't going to gamble irresponsibly on sports smh.
Is there any news? Or just the drop before earnings

Have an active +20% banbet.  
Wish I could get myself banned even more but it is what it is.
Okay okay okay‚Ä¶ give me some calls to buy, I‚Äôm sick of this shit
10:00 dump happened at 11:00?  Did someone forget to tell the MMs that the clocks don't change until this weekend?
I'm really bad at selling call options
Fuck I closed my AMZN calls yesterday and missed out on another $10k gains. Only make $8k instead because I‚Äôm a giant pussy ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
I had 3 11/5 3350 calls for 1900 each. They were 11k each last time I checked. So glad I sold for 2500
The missed gains hurts so much worse than losses
Yeah I mean I would‚Äôve never held to 14.5k each but I sure would‚Äôve like to hold two more day. Could‚Äôve turned 6k into 20k or 50k at best if i had diamond hands for once
The worst thing is that I am pdt so can‚Äôt sell my F for even a fukin loss. Down $800 out of $2000
How are you down on F? You bought puts?
Bought calls this morning. Check what it‚Äôs trading at now
Sheesh godspeed it is drilling
I thought you could still sell down positions when labelled ptd but couldn't buy?
It would be day trade to do so because I bought this morning
From ibkr

&gt; Customers should be able to close any existing positions in his account, but will not be allowed to initiate any new positions

But it looks like you don't want to seek because it will contribute to pdt.

Whoa SPY. Too early for drunk lunch.
Who thought tapering would be bullish?!
i was expecting the market to dump like .5-1% or so and then swoop in to BTFD since tapering = QE

this... is not what i was expecting
Everyone. No taper would be a bloodbath. Big bois rush the exits & flood the market with selling, then buy back at next level. Taper, no more help , so get what u can.
THis guy. said it repeatedly for weeks.

The year is 2025. It is Easter Sunday in the WSB metaverse. The Fed's taper has not yet begun. WISH is still trading at $5 a share. Masses of degenerate gamblers and sinners gather their VR headsets to virtually worship St Powell of Brr at the church of MANGA. 

Each autist patiently waits to receive their $666 Central Bank Digital Easter Stimulus (their 13th stimulus that year). St Powell's soft words echo in their headsets and tickle their ears: "Fear not, for I am with you. Inflation is transitory." 

Thanks to the cooperative efforts of the Church of MANGA, the last of the üêª'S had been hunted to extinction.

But it was all right. Everything was all right. The üêª'S were finished. The autists had won the game of life. They loved Jerome.
And PLTR still at 25
TSLA is such a tease. They know I have a banbet for tomorrow for 1250 so it‚Äôs gonna stay right under it until the last minute lol.
they're watching u

TSLA will hit 1250 by 3:00 PM ET
Tbh looks like it‚Äôs gonna hit it in the next 20 minutes

So Lambo or was if a $50 play?
Model Lambo after taxes
So mad I didn't buy the call I was looking at yesterday afternoon
all these NVDA upgrades and NVDA is like okay ill hit it today
NVDA gonna barrel past 300 soon af
watch out, VIX rising
Still gonna find a way to lose money
Me this morning:

I'll buy back into NVDA at open, half money at open and half at the morning dip.

:clownface:
PayPal and visa are legit hard buys right now. Buy actual dips when things are out of favor, but the fundamentals and growth are still intact and good as ever. This is how money is made. Visa 300 average price target but it‚Äôs trading at 209. That‚Äôs a buy

Heard that
NVDA, wow just wow crazy how strong that rocket is
Trap all bears. ABAG (all bears are gay).
I really want to buy nvda calls but it'd be foolish to on a day like this.
literally been saying that since i saw it at 270s, fomoed in twice and made money on the runup to 290. Don't miss the runup to 300... happening rn not financial advice btw
Fuk man i was staring at nvda yesterday when it was around 263, and the call options for 300c was 8$, i was thinking throw in 4000 for 500 contracts then i thinking about losing it all. Im a scared man
At least you didn‚Äôt buy 13 otm call contracts yesterday before close and then sell them at 275 this morning for a few K just to watch it go up another 6% afterward and still climbing‚Ä¶worst FOMO feeling I‚Äôve ever had from a sell don‚Äôt know what I was thinking
Damn bro i feel u whenever i sold too early it keeps going up. If i hold my calls it tanks after 8am damn damn
Yep‚Ä¶I swear some greasy Bogdan gets on the phone and tells his Nasdaq buddies every time I hold or sell and pumps/hedges accordingly‚Ä¶

6‚Äô5 best height. You‚Äôre a big dude but not everyone stares at you big, except in China.
I don't like people over 5'11

SAVA is a good stock, I sold out earlier bc I was not patient. But you hold that bitch for 5 years, it‚Äôll do ya well
DKNG you little bitch, here comes my ban üòÇ
Damn they're brutalizing $pypl out here
The stock market is a UBI. The fuck is Yang talking about
House Plans To Hike Taxes On Rich, Corporations By $1.48T


Surely this time the rich will raise taxes on the rich right guys?
Of course! Pelosi and her 100 Million care for the common people. She‚Äôs one of us! She‚Äôs been in congress for how many years? Look at all the progress she‚Äôs made ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôè
Rich probably end up meaning 75k+
Guys, SPY needs to drop like 5% or more before this is even fathomably bear territory
Cathie always sells at the bottom
Welp, my account turned really fukin green, really fukin quick! üòÇüçª
Before the fake news about SAVA came out the stock was at the 130-140$ range so this shit still has plenty of room to grow. Expecting some big jumps. Still super undervalued. Also 23% SI. I‚Äôm not one to pump squeeze‚Äôs but yeah
FinTwit all bought above 100
Completely agree‚Ä¶thinking it‚Äôll juice again tomorrow
i have gotten absolutely destroyed this week chasing plays. time for a week long timeout

No mercy for you
TSLA is like a heroine addict that refuses to give up even after being shot multiple times
No. TSLA is the heroin.

S&P500 is the self-described innocent, unsuspecting, experimental, open-minded suburbian who thinks they have the willpower to try it once and kick it.

It will eventually learn the definition of soul-crushing but not until it destroys its non-heroin life first.
That really is more accurate
COST is the sneakiest pump stock ever. It quietly rises every single day.
I fucking love COST. My LEAPS have crushed over the past few months. No one ever talks about it.
Really regretting not buying shares when I first noticed it‚Äôs sneakiness.. back at about $350 or treeeeefitty
Not taking profits til it breaks 467 damn it
Be ready for anything
Gaps, retest 34,000 DJIA
Congrats to those that bought the TSLA dip üéâ
There was a dip? I don't even watch my portfolio anymore. 

I buy calls, close app and then get a general sentiment of what's going on via wsb
when you lose all your bear money 1 week before the market crash
Moving back in on DKNG right now, make a few bucks for the day.
imma need FB to shoot back up again
Got rid of baba and bough fb 380 dec calls
December???? Damn I would‚Äôve bought till like June
I have June ones also but the dec is a small few calls
Nice. If it dips again I might do the same
Revenge of the NRDS
Signed up for 2K of NRDS, got 0 allocated, and I haven‚Äôt even flipped IPOs previously. Fucking dumb.
How is the PayPal dip not being bought??? I don‚Äôt understand
Cause all money going into nvda and tsla
I bought some calls today. Might be shit but it‚Äôs just looking so beat up
When it closes near 235 I'll go in.
You mean 225?
No. I mean 235. When I see upward momentum towards 235, I will go in. Right now it's showing no signs of life.
SPY put to call basically 1:1 and QQQ now 1.2. Let‚Äôs see who comes out on top.
DKNG and PENN in the gutter lol
The BS talk this morning with Cramer saying the pandemic stocks are over‚Ä¶ because you know we‚Äôre all going to stop gambling‚Ä¶
This earnings season have been BRUTAL for growth stocks. Many are down 10-25% overnight even after beating estimates.
Ahh yeah up 60 percent on nerds out the gate  ü•∏
In the metaverse I‚Äôll be making the margin calls.
NVDA undervalued, should hit 300 today
I'm a TSLA fan bull..... I'm getting the fuck out right here cause this shit bout to pop. You boys not gonna fuck on me.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
I've never seen so many stocks drop 15% or more during earnings season.
I'm up 360% on my nvda calls I was gonna let roll til earnings...
I love NVDA
Well fuck there go my Spy puts
Ahh bears getting hoodwinked again. As is tradition
Puts for mid month, calls for early month
Celebrating $SAVA day. Glad I didn't fully cash out two days ago when it jumped 40%. Another 50% jump today. I'm out, but thinking I'll back in if it dips to $70. Thoughts?
Tried to sell calls when it was at $100, but $85 calls expiring tomorrow are still going for $5‚Ä¶ yes please

Edit: actually sold the $100s for $3
I trimmed but not all the way out. I am super excited for them to be cleared on the data thing because it would be amazing for AD patients to have viable treatment available. I'll rebuy if it dips but probably keep what I have.
Lmfao nvda can you calm down you‚Äôre supposed to hit 300 tomorrow
So much pain watching it after closing calls this morning.
The top has to be near for NVDA lol too much talk of it now
legit people thought 200 was too high
Yeah unrealistic price right now over speculation
"No need for safety nets when you're already flying."

Thanks Panda Express fortune cookie, all in SPY calls
NRDS already halted twice haha
Whole market going on a bull run through tthanks giving

December first weeks folks will def take some gains but will rally again thru dec 31 SPY will end ATH

Calling the top is hard :(
Nearly impossible honestly
NVDA 300 EOD apparently. holy moley.

Position sizing is so important in trading.
If you know you know.
That‚Äôs why I almost never fret about my credit spreads. Even a max loss on some of them would barely be a flesh wound bc lot size is smollll
i expect to see some really really really ridiculous NVDA gains today
I went with tesla over Nvidia this morning üò£
Dont you just love the circular reference that are Price Upgrades?

STOCK A trades at $50

Analysts upgrade to $55 from $45

STOCK A up 20% due to upgrade to $55

Analysts upgrade to $65 from $55

Rinse and repeat. Classic.

Cough NVDA Cough
Started a MRNA long here - wtf.
Bought NVDA calls this morning and forgot i used my last PDT yesterday and now i can‚Äôt sell. Guess i‚Äôm holding till tomorrow.
Sell an equal number of contracts one strike above the ones you bought to lock in your current profit
You may lose some profit, but 0 chance it drops 10%. Lol
Just add 25k to your account you Gucci
Don't fear
Buying NVDA options with less than 25k account lol.
üêÄ
This guys hates poors. I think you should just deposit 25k and decide not to be poor anmore.
Nio is never a good play. Fuk
Is that a joke?
Fuck r u saying, it broke out üòÇ it‚Äôs gonna hit $46 tomo
NRDS looking juicy

$F ... an imminent pop next week due to Rivian IPO.. let's go peeps!
So uhhh buy calls
Calls loaded for next spring when they deliver the f150 lightnings
nice! when are they due?
How do you figure Ford popping off due to Rivian? Is that pick up based on the F-150?
It's truly amazing how much easier this is once you have like 20gs and can just buy leaps and still make a shit ton.
Do you just wait for rapid movement or hold 1 year?
Rapid movement, sell, buy leaps with higher strikes, repeat.
NRDS would hit 40$ today easy money
pushing metaverse every 30 minutes on cnbc 

i cannot believe they think that we will want to sit in our virtual office, cross the virtual bridge, and pour ourselves a virtual cup of coffee.

just a way to pump all of tech to stupid numbers
id shoot myself if i had to do any virtual office and some furry has a virtual costume of him in a suit in the corner
Its all just a way to pump us with more advertisements.
what else in big tech is even worth talking about?
‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù is the endgame of western society and capitalism

corporations will literally create the world you interact, think, work and consume in

Be me. Have a choice to buy FDs. Choose DKNG over AMD. DKNG stagnant, AMD +400%.

FUCK
GME be creepin
GME be creepin then boom down 10% off someone selling 50 shares lmao
Who the fuck is betting $200 that NVDA breaks 350 in a week? Whatever im happy with my +350%
Mind yo business
Momentum plays. Scalped a quick 600 bucks off 320 calls in a week. First time I made 600 in five minutes was behind a Wendy's dumpsters, but it was a lot more work.
AMD isn‚Äôt done yet
Im so itching to sell my 20 calls....but have a feeling it isn't done either.
I have $137 11/12 calls

Mara or bbby both could moon
MARA ER is coming in a few days, i got a good feeling about them.

So that‚Äôs why OCGN tanked
Yeah, but it‚Äôs gonna go up now right? ü§†

SAVA will hit $100 eod or tomorrow. Wheneve margin calls go out.
Do a ban bet. Don‚Äôt be a bich
It‚Äôs going down And my poooots thank you
We are pround to announce that NVDA is included in the ETF "MOON" .

This ETF has TSLA and NVDA now.

I woke up this morning with numb with rage, should have fuckin sold my puts yesterday
My issue is I couldn‚Äôt sell yesterday due to day trade restrictions. Being poor fucking sucks ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
I couldn‚Äôt sell for some reason either, probably just Robin Hood bending me over and fucking me, and the funniest part about it is that I knew this was going to happen

You left out TDOC

Once NRDS passes 32, it will go to 35 easily
Amd and nvda are mooning so hard im thinking of selling out my long term holdings... 40% in a month fuck
OCGN back to under 10 again. OCGN is like the PLTR of bio stocks. More volatile but you can always rely on it to trade in a range.

I used to work with a lady who bought Nvidia at 15 pre split. When I left work her stake was about 200k. Probably about 600k now
That math doesn‚Äôt add up brother
I‚Äôm not sure what it‚Äôs valued at now. I assume 600k, maybe less. When I saw it on her phone it was worth about 200k
Being patient is an amazing thing. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm long future big tech like NIO. You will see the same kind of winner stories from longs on stocks like that.
I used to own Nio. Started buying at 5 and sold at 50. Easy 300k
Mad decent yo
Wow definitely bought the wrong expiration on NVDA lol
Got 03/2022 this morning but damn already up 100%
I'm long nvda but shit maybe I should take some profits, sheesh
You for sure should man
hell ya, sold it off at 300 for 80% gain :)
Take profits.  I bought $400 calls for $47/each back in July and expiring January 2022.  Sold them for $540/each today.  Take the profits on calls, hold the shares if you have em
amzn you fucking slut thank you
F calls go brrrrrrr
Sell some CCs on NVDA yo
Fucked up all my trades this morning so I‚Äôm shitposting for the rest of the day. Can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt jump in nvda
SPY 500 to $500 by EOY
Why EOY? Been toying with this one‚Ä¶
That‚Äôs another 6 or 7% percent run up - just because we‚Äôve seen that other the past month or so doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs likely in the next 7 weeks.

How is this still climbing with VIX running this much?
TSM finally doing something ? After all this time
TSM under 150 is a joke
Last year it speed ran from November to January. Could it do it again?
It should especially since their prices just went up another 20%
Congrats SAVA holders
Weird VIX Activity considering spy is green.
Last time I saw that was near the top of September 2020 selloff

How does Fed money make it into stocks?
Im assuming they hand the job off to Blackrock.
They buy bonds which causes bondholders to buy stocks.
bondholders sell and use the proceeds to buy equities
JPow goes into Robinhood and sells calls and puts
I actually wonder if they have secret accounts and buy stocks directly.

Why the fuck is CHGG still going down? Earnings was bad, but not cut the company in half bad.
Wiped out all gains since Jul 2018.  Bought some leap calls to hope for a return to form over the next 1-2 years.  This loss did seem a bit drastic.  We will see if I caught a falling knife.
No 5G this year. T is fucked.
Made a cool 500 on OCGN puts. Ill take it
Thinking about buying December QQQ puts today
Not the worst idea. Debt ceiling still needs to be raised
I gotta take a shit but my cat is on my lap‚Ä¶.
Don‚Äôt you fuckin move.
How about that AMD stock huh
It‚Äôs a good hold. Gonna x3 in this coming year.
Yup, had that idea in mind
Opinions on Visa dip?
My mom and bro just piled in
Yes
I have a V leap for Jan 2023, it‚Äôs going up. Just make sure you buy enough time on the contracts
Should have just put the money in AMZN leaps rather than trying to wheel ROKU üòíüòíüòíüòí
Oh lord, is this a sign for DKNG earnings? It‚Äôs a complete gamble at this point, I was wondering why an insider sold 10% of his position this week

Beer on me fellow apes.  My 500 shares of BIOL went up a whopping .028 giving me a $14 gain today, making my loss from -444 to -430.  #mybagghold
My NVDA calls are getting crushed. Stock up 3% higher than purchase and these calls are barely green. They were up 40% about an hour ago
you dont buy calls when shit is volatile, youll get IV crushed very fast
Strike price ?
Expiration ? Probably theta
People are rolling out of your strike and buying calls further out happens every time in a parabolic move.
Crazy bro maybe literally everyone realizes it‚Äôs overvalued
i managed to exit those at a profit, it's been hell don't do weeklies the theta is too fierce
Apple better stay green you bitch
The real question is will NVDA continue to jump through tomorrow or dump
Continue to jump, tomorrow calls are the easiest money you‚Äôll ever make
Make a banbet for tomorrow
buying calls not selling CC correct? Thinking about buying 310C for Dec. cost around 1.80 premium tho
Yeah buy
Stupid question but are you referring to 11/5 calls?
Yes
I am an expert at losing money and my instinct says it will run up until earnings then dump on poor guidance/supply chain blah blah blah.
NVDA: up 13% in one day

I love NVDA and I own NVDA and plan to hold NVDA for a very long time, but is there any news on what's driving this explosion upwards?
something something metaverse. This is going to be like 3d printers all over again, where the hype is massive and all you get are tiny plastic unicorns. NVDA will probably hold well enough, it doesn‚Äôt need the metaverse.

I'VE BEEN ON NVDA'S AND AMD'S DICKS. GLAD THEY CAME THROUGH.
Did Cathie sell nvidia yesterday? That‚Äôs the only reason I can think of for it mooning so much today

Same. Good luck
Good luck fren
I step away for one minute and NVDA pops more lol
Get to 400 QQQ.
Gonna get some hookers with my NVDA gains
NVDA is this what viagra feels like
I‚Äôm so numb I feel like this whole thing is surreal. Have to hold overnight due to PDT rule so we will see how I feel in AM.
Maybe you can convert them to spreads?
Goddamn I‚Äôm so fuckin hard right now for nvidia, been holding this shit forever and I still see no reason to sell‚Ä¶. Now if only all my shares had actually been calls‚Ä¶..
Elon bought to tweet some stupid shit, i can feel the autism through my twitter feed
Tis a gambling market
which is why we invest in DKNG
Fomo‚Äôd into nvda good luck everyone

Boys, don't give into the marketing. 5g or not, T-Mobile is the *worst* mobile provider in North America, boys

PENN and DKNG are steals EOD !
IDK that PENN revenue miss and Portnoy stuff says steer clear for a bit IMO. DKNG I've been waiting for a juicy dip. Not sure if it's done though.

I got AMD calls at the top
Me. Check comment history

Job. I genuinely work my job for structure and to feel im doing something.

I could live off CCs and a couple trades.
Lmao I work actually. From home, being a knowledge worker is amazing but when theres nothing going, still get paid but hella bored.

On the other hand, congrats, you're truly free.

In reality I wanted to go 10k into TSLA puts but IV is just way too fucking high it's retarded so had to short 20 shares
About to lose about $10k
girl in my finance class said "penis" when trying to pronounce "pins" so im buying calls on it for earnings.

nah NET puts are the way (honestly NET will probably do well in earnings but im hoping it behaves like CRSR's last few earnings where they beat but the stock still drops cuz fuck logic)
DIS finally made it to 170, now the mind games start. Do I sell out for 40% gain or risk it all for contracts expiring tomorrow?
Sell

Gonna go jump off Brooklyn bridge because I didn‚Äôt buy nvda.
I'm happy for everyone who made money today (myself included), but massive swings like this are incredibly unhealthy and suggest a market which is rapidly destabilizing.

So Elon‚Äôs tweet was actually a bear trap ü™§ üêª
If you had basic reading skills it was obvious. The tweet was nothing but bullish but bears were so fucking desperate they latched onto thier only liferaft
Eh, I agree the tweet was bullish but the problem was it introduced confusion and wasn‚Äôt straightforward in nature. The market reacted badly the next day (no, the sky didn‚Äôt fall or anything) so bears were slightly right about the tweet affecting the stock. But there‚Äôs no stopping this rocket ship now üòå
Yes. I averaged down and am straight killing.

Dude, just hold any long dated calls since we're back on easy mode
People are afraid of inflation and dumping their money into the stock market to hedge against it. They prefer stocks instead of precious metals right now. It's all speculative, none of the hot stocks are really worth their actual value.

Smart.  I myself got out at spy390 cause it was nuts and I couldn‚Äôt understand why it kept going up.
This is just disgusting. NVDA up 40% in 1 month. Talking about euphoria right before the crash.
I finally get why Elon Musk is so hated.

Wallstreet has absolutely ZERO control over $TSLA. Look at the fucking daily chart. I mean what the fuck. Everybody who believes in Elon makes fucking money and that is money that Wallstreet doesnt get.

hey guys i'm starting to think NVDA is a bit bullish today
A bit?
Made 752% on my NVDA calls today and I could‚Äôve made an additional 700%. Fuck I sold too early
Welcome to the club. Missed out on 2200% gains üòÇ
Gains is gains
Dude. I bought 275 calls at 7am, sold them at BREAK EVEN because I got cold feet. Would‚Äôve made $200k
Oh my god I‚Äôm so sorry man ü•≤
to those who feel bad of 'missing' out on NVDA, i too could of loaded on 1dte 290s when they were about $150 in the am, but went with monthlies of 300 for more 'protection' im up 6k on them, however the 1dte are looking at about 35k gains. this is one of the hardest parts in trading were you get this huge "fomo' to go in, however you had no idea and should look at it as making solid profit on what you did do, It sucks but it avoids doing a irrational move. which may happen say a few days from now as you try 'making up' for that trade.
Nah, that's stupid. You made the correct decision. Thinking like that will lose all your gains. Keep thinking nsafe and smart
and its a problem i had/caused me to lose a huge amount earlier this year, im more trying to say for people in that position right now, to def not overthink it. cause its like a poison and will cause you to be -90% in a week

Mine wouldn't execute. Lost everything in seconds. RIP.
If you jumped into NVDA AFTER $300 you deserve to get wrecked 

Most people jumped in at $280 or so
Plz this shit ain‚Äôt done
For today it is. Still room to go for the month.
I tried at 279 but didn‚Äôt get filled and thought it was basically at that $300 level with limited upside. Derp!
I never leave a trade unfilled. Instantly adjust it if not filled in 10 seconds
sold at the top of NVDA. Huzzah
You sure it's the top? Lol.
shaky hands get ready for a rip back up before earnings going to be 330 a share shortly.
Top for this week probably.
If you be greedy you‚Äôll become a bag holder.
This is my usual motto but this morning I wasn‚Äôt greedy enough and missed massive gains on NVDA.
Take some profits but not all. When you try to time the top, you‚Äôll be forced to sell at the bottom.

> I'm not stupid. I know what you're trying to do
Sell cocaine. Lol
TSLA calls
Compound interest is safest way.

Fastest way is sell an organ.
Sell covered calls or cash secured puts

You could also do credit spreads but those are more risky
Any ideas on what stock to sell puts?
Look at a company you wouldn‚Äôt mind owning if your puts went against you, and sell at the price you wouldn‚Äôt mind owning at, idk what exact stock is good for that but I like intel, can‚Äôt see it going below $49

Holy fucking shit what happened with oil overnight? Thought I had at least today to close out short positions playing the pullback‚Ä¶
/CL goes up, /CL goes down‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt explain that
Par for the course, it's been very volatile in this $80-85 range (/CL). I think it's going to consolidate here for a little bit but likely we'll see 90-100 by EOY
Yeah at least‚Ä¶just figured with how extended we are and how it had been losing some steam that we would get more than a single day of pullback. If anything this move tells us the run is definitely not over

Edit‚Ä¶actually we may just pull back off the open. Was just scanning my watchlist in an Uber but looking closer we are still in a short term downtrend and could catch another leg down pretty easily
Yea I see what you mean, but I've got the impression that $80 is going to be a major support level/floor for /CL for the time being and I'd be a buyer anytime we touch that.  
That's no guarantee of course...
Well it certainly looks solid right now. I will definitely be looking to go long or at least neutral around that point if it gets there today
...and we're under $80 on the day, pretty volatile

The call is after market dumbass.
Lol whoops
Lol thanks for at least admitting you‚Äôre wrong, cheers.
Makes sense.. cost labor up 8.3% so stocks should go up‚Ä¶ new normal.
When the wage slaves get money they spend it. Bullish AF.

/u/hallett21 (2/1) made a bet that F would go to 19.0 when it was 18.22 and it did, congrats fucker.
Damn and I thought my Tesla 1325 11/5 call was fucked. Probably still is tbh.
You‚Äôll be good.
So my tsla 1250c gonna be itm by market open. Cool cool
Wish I wouldn‚Äôt have sold my 2 1200c when it was wavering at 1200 yesterday around 2:15. Fuck I didn‚Äôt want to take big old loss on it today but it would have been a big ol gain fuck!
Bro 2 weeks ago I bought 5 950c for 11/26 for 13.70 each and sold them for 50.  Currently printing at 300 or so when the market opens
Very bullish!
What's the riskiest Uranium ticker to get on today? I wanna roll the dice

QCOM was such an obvious earnings play ugh
I know. I‚Äôm a dumb dumb. It‚Äôs a ticker I haven‚Äôt followed. Almost went in and bought post market yesterday but decided to drink some beer instead.
Ugh indeed
Open at open? Sounds good to me. CEO running mouth.
I am jacked to the tits with plays today let's make some money!
Get em
It‚Äôs a shame the ticker for Chad is some lame bear ETF for China otherwise I‚Äôd be all in
Hmm does the country Chad have a ticker?
I will buy FD calls and the market will tank. Just wait and see
I don‚Äôt think even your bad luck can stop this train, but give er a try
Maybe these 48CC for DKNG wasn‚Äôt smart
I didn't get any earnings plays right this quarter. Sad af. Even ETST failed me
JNUG calls for the lulz?

Yes.
Haven't even read any DD lmao. I feel that there was an overreaction to Ebay's new default payment option last summer, and hopefully PayPal's venture into kryptoe will be acknowledged after the next earnings call.
AMC is not GME
AMD is not GMC
Damn $Z I need you drop like $3 you ass wipe
The tendy man will come today boys but hopefully he doesn‚Äôt bring gluten free tendies
Of course when I buy puts, Z recovers. Come on.....
who told you to buy puts when it's down 30% over 3 days? You thought it'd just drill to 0?
yeah, you're supposed to buy puts before the drop, silly
Right. Not 2/3 days after. Just be able to predict the future bro it's easy bro.
Cathie sold bro. You should have known.
Getting caught up holding house bags was bad but they still have their real estate business. All of our wives are sitting next to us looking at Zillow while we look at wsb, and that's not going to change.
Dude, you bought puts after a 25% drop and didn't expect any bounce?

TD declined my limit order for a TSLA call even with the cash on hand for it.  Maybe they‚Äôre expecting a little dip to fuel these rockets.

If you not buying F calls do you even like money ?
If you‚Äôre not buying F calls it‚Äôs because you have the most basic chart reading skills. I sold and will get back in around $16.50
Wtf GME lol

Should never have sold those NVDA CCs, jesus christ.  Made that mistake with NET and NVDA and it's killed me completely.
Let‚Äôs go TSLA!! 1300!!!
Easy 50% on MSFT calls bought during dip probably gonna hold and lose it all
I have without doubt severely fucked up
How many of you quit your job to trade stocks?
I just trade at work that way I still make money if I have a red day.
I used to do that too before I quit
I quit my stock to trade jobs
blowjobs
If TSLA isn‚Äôt the most valuable company by EOY, the market is broken
Yeah so the instant i buy calls it goes straight down
Me with BBBY today
I feel that‚Äôs the casino part of this shit house wins
If you have money on NVDA you have large PP
How long can a stock be halted? Damn.
Are we supposed to know which one you are talking about?
SAVA
Which one??
NVDA I CANT FOCUS
Anyone selling or just letting their spy calls run? I got 10 670c for 2 weeks from now and it looks like they could actually go in the money
You mean 470 right?
Yes! I'm typing one handed while eating lol, couldn't hit the 4
670, pretty ballsy.
I think a 60% return on the market in 2 weeks is pretty regular

You know exactly where I‚Äôm cuming from
so I was just kidding when I said NVDA will hit Wells Fargo's 320 target today but uhhh ....

Fuck man, I thought after 5 green days in a row and a pump yesterday that SPX would go red at least a little bit today get a new buy in point. Shiiiiiit
SPY $475C 11/10 like only $14 a pop
Perfectly priced. Feel like 475 might be a bit ambitious for 11/10 but it'll be close.

Is it too late to hop on the NVDA train? mmmm

thanks a lot, now its gonna go down
Nice to be back to the days when you don't need to open your account since you know it's just going up every day
this morning: man NVDA cant possibly keep going can it? that FD looks so juicy tho...

now: wait NVDA, you forgot to take my pussy ass oon your rocket ship reeeeeeeee
So Cathie dumps Z, and if flies back up. Cathie is the Anti-Pelosi

Nvda on the way to 290 EOD
gotta stop dicking around here first
Man... if i didnt hedge my SAVA play id be browsing what houses to buy rn

Account still a giant green hulk dick today tho
I'd rather look at my phone every 15 seconds instead of doing literally anything else.
Go Nio woop
SAVA to $100 EOD
MILE calls. Tesla is looking to acquire them. Heard on WSB.
hold rkt calls thru earnings or bail out for measily 100% profit??
Bail.  They missed last earnings
Would take profits, but if you wanna be daring, short calls that pay out premium equivalent to your debit. So if you put $1.00 per call, sell whatever strike gives you $1. This way you have a vertical spread for earnings that is risk free
Anyone else thinking QQQ is gonna hit 400 EOD??
Today is a great day
Calls on Snake üêç Oil
Guh. PayPal. How much lower can it go???
The worst
No idea, thought after the FED meeting it would go up again.
All I want for Christmas is SPY 500.
How the fuck is zillow up? Fuck off with this shit man.
Sell off was too unreasonable
So you‚Äôre saying spy puts were not the move today
They are never the move
I should know better
Lol and of course I sold them too soon
Damn man, can't catch a break
Par for the course, reloaded up on calls now
Hopefully the market didn't see and it will go up even though you bought calls
ü§£
I'm not buying puts anymore on spy, spy only goes up
Nvda said cya üöÄ
SAVA about to touch 100$
You‚Äôre retarded if you think it‚Äôll stabilize this high
Why is it ripping?

when do I sell my SPY 465c 11/5...starting to get nervous with these gains lol
I sold my 461s like 10 minutes after open and rolled them into 468 11/12s
Just sell half
I only have the 1
Just be like me and sell it yesterday for break even

ü§°ü§Æü§°
This QQQ shit is literally a straight line up
Who would‚Äôve known NVDA calls at the top right before JPOW spoke would print their tits off?? It‚Äôs me.. I did.. I knew that hahaha

My AMD ban 140 ban bet might hit‚Ä¶ I wanted a break from you fuckers
AMD finally doin its thing
It‚Äôs been ripping for a few days‚Ä¶but I feel ya
I bought a 135 at its highest so it's not worth shit to me I'm just making back what i spent smh
Shit, I sold early. I definitely thought there would be a correction after earnings. Oh well, I put the profits in DOT and it‚Äôs up 25%.
I hate how F is sloooowwww
Slow and steady wins the race!
It‚Äôs so annoying all for me to not look at it for an hour or so and eat shit
Might be sideways today after rip yesterday and ah
Why do i keep listening to dumb ass ppl on here
Life is like a gloryhole, you never know what‚Äôs on the other side
Those are unsanitary

god dam. which one of you rich idiots keep buying tsla at 1240!!! wtf!?

Hoping to jump back into AMD but that shit never dips.
me with nvidia
yep shoulda bought NVDA calls yesterday
Get into ON semiconductor
Or COHU which is the auto supplier of chips which are really needed.
Lol why would it dip in a literal chip shortage

ü§°
Couple days ago sold my sava pos to increases ocgn stocks. Awesome
I‚Äôm loaded with amd calls but the euphoria in here plus the parabolic move in all of tech is making me very nervous
Roll it out?
MSFT 337 now plz
Almost paper handed my 335c's this morning, glad I held out
tsla calls here or wait?
100% wait
until close or what?
Entire market overbought* right now. I would wait for the next pullback. TSLA is up 56% in the last month. That's insane.
The fuck is up with sava?
Short report was bullshit about SAVA faking their data. They are the best Alzheimer drug around now according to the data, should be worth a ton if it pans out and gets FDA approval
News that they did not manipulate their data, which is what knocked the price down a while back
Close my Zillow puts or is this a relief rally and it'll die back down?
Extremely bullish on ABNB. I‚Äôm expecting them to crush earnings with amazing guidance ahead
AMD about to take off again
Unpopular opinion: PTON is a buy right now.

Disclosure: I haven't bought it yet.
I am bout to buy puts for earnings
I have a feeling PTON is going to go on a run. I‚Äôm just not sure if I should buy now or wait for earning and see what happens with the movement.
Bought shares of RKT, feel really confident it's gonna pop to 20 after earnings. My last 5 confident plays have been wrong, so trust me
SAVA shorts are getting blown up‚Ä¶.tomorrow this should pump above $100
GOOG heading for 3k. absolute retarded face ripper of a day
AMD is heading for 200 and I‚Äôm here for it
Saaame
Mr JPOW I don‚Äôt feel too good
Any predictions for Airbnb earnings?
Anybody holding UBER calls for ER after bell?
Dr. SAVAge was right. Also was quoted on a article yesterday.
Paper handed my AMD 11/5c yesterday üò£

But profit is profit.
I bought 11/12
I thought about the 11/12 140c at open this morning but that thought has come and gone.  

Still holding my 1/21 100c tho.
I bought $137 calls for 11/12

Anyone playing SQ earnings? Thoughts gladly accepted. I‚Äôm not, but am playing PYPL weeklies on that green doji printed yesterday into the close. Could be short term bottoming for a rip to 240+ but SQ earnings likely going to impact PYPL as the sympathy

TSLA teasing me hard just go up
Those cup and handle tells me it is going 1250
I‚Äôve got a 9 out of 10 record on my recent options plays but I‚Äôd have a lot more money if I wasn‚Äôt such a coward and held these positions longer before selling. I‚Äôve left about 6 bags on the table selling too soon

You think I should hold or nah. I was planning on Jsut day trading the sharws
My Tesla ours are up 30% from yesterday just from the IV increase, can‚Äôt complain
if anyone kept buying weeklies for nvidia and tesla since october, they would've been set for life at this point.
If anyone just made the right plays theyd make money
Maybe this past week was a blow off top
I‚Äôve seen too many people comparing SPYs growth to a logarithmic blow off top chart on Twitter for this to be the top
BBBY in the green, keep holding!!
NVDA just gapped up 2 bucks after trying to be pushed down. LMAOOO Bears fukt

Bought F calls at open over NVDA, wtf was i thinking.
at least you should still make some money
sold for a 25% loss.
Thoughts on draft kings?
Lots of competition on the sports betting app market. MGM, Caesars, and others.
If DKNG doesn‚Äôt jump on earnings I‚Äôm ded
same, i added on todays dip, i think its dropped enough that even if earnings are underwhelming, it will recover quickly.
Should go up from here
Lots of competition on the sports betting app market. MGM, Caesars, and others.
Modern-guh
Am thinking DKNG has hit its low for the day, food for thought :)
If your girl don‚Äôt know what a SPY gap is, she def don‚Äôt know what a thigh gap is.
DKNG drilling has stopped for now. But I bought calls so it may go to 40 by EOD.
I destroyed myself on buying calls on Monday with a $48.50 break even. And just cut losses
i did the same, but i just doubled down
I tossed my remaining on SAVA calls
Don‚Äôt say that :)
Alexa play Bleed
Lol why is BB getting its dick beaten off?
Cause it‚Äôs institutional ownership is very high and they sold a fuckload of covered calls so they would rather sell enough to get it close to the strike (11$) rather than let all their calls get exercised. This happens with BB every week. Always finishes right around 10 or 11.

Anyone get in on AMD + Xilinx merger?

XLNX one share = 1.7234 shares of AMD
1.7234 shares of AMD at current price is 234. 

XLNX trading at 197-198 right now. AMD likely to go higher.
I may buy some xlnx in a dip
I don't know about you, but I'd buy it right now. It seems as if even if Xilinx goes up, so is AMD. Either way, you are getting a good deal.
if amd starts running hard arbitrageurs may widen more the gap and give a better entry point.
Do you know when it's supposed to merge?
By end of year. Pretty sure it's a done deal too!
Thanks! lol the merger window for hardware companies seems so long, Nvidia + ARM was announced to be 14 months when they signed it.
Nothing more free then PayPal options¬ø
Bought some calls today. Hoping this is the turnaround.
I actually picked up some 240c let's see how it goes.

hopefully QCOM has another big day tomorrow so these cheap FD‚Äôs üñ® Also added some shares in my one retirement account
Qcom should have a very good year in 2022, conservative price target is 200, could easily go up to 250/260 if things stay this bullish for them
Yup I was looking for another company to compliment my NVDA and AMD positions
How are there people here who don't have an NVDA position?
Cuz we sold it ü§°
Yea I sold nvidia gains to buy the real chip plays which are tsm and Qcom. Nvidia is great but way way wayyyy overvalued

Asking for a concerned friend....is there a return policy for SAVA $95+ Buyers today?
RSI on everything is way overbought. Next week gonna be bloodyyyy. But im a bull so I only buy calls. So VIX calls it is
It can go flat for a week to bring RSI down and continue to go up and repeat forever.
Would be ideal

I magically bought leaps at the top today and am now underwater. Instead of buying more NVDA. I thought "I own way to much NVDA atm"

Yes. I‚Äôm hoping the issues were company specific and the pullback in DKNG is overdone and will reverse after earnings. 

We will see tomorrow AM. Make or break for the stock.

Yes

Life keeps shitting on me but accounts at all time highs. Market keeping me going, securing some profits today.
I am so depressed about my CCs on NVDA.  245s sold right before it jumped 7-8% last week.  Fucking insane.  I should never sell CCs, it always ends badly even tho I try to not sell them unless stuff is way up.  NET and NVDA, both ran so far past it's gross.
You‚Äôre not supposed to sell CC‚Äôs on high growth, super bullish companies. Fucking a. Why would you do that?
thinking the same thing. let it be a lesson learned for our brother.
Fair but NVDA already top 10 in SPY weight, companies that large already shouldn't really shoot up 50% in a month.
Shouldn‚Äôt? In the future‚Ä¶. Do you think there will be more computers, or less computers? 

Processing chip demand is not going away. Ever. 

We‚Äôre putting chips in refrigerators now. Bullish af.
That is all true, but NVDA is already so large that gaining 50% market cap in a month is insane.  NET is crazy but more understandable since it's such a small stock relatively.
Idk. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too crazy considering that their revenue is estimate to grow 50-60% next year. And with Meta, it might grow even more. The $$$ matches the stock growth.
should buy a call a few strikes above the one you sold if ur worried about having them called away. You make less $, but ur covered incase the stonks shoots to the moon. 
or you can just buy them back and take the loss on the calls
I was selling covered calls on F all year and it worked until it didn't- that shit is up so much now
sell CC on Woods picks and not Pelosi's
I got burned on both as well. I mean you're talking about 2 of the most insane runes i've ever seen though.
Yep, 50% in a month for NVDA and 100% for NET.  From already elevated levels.  Insane.  At least I captured some of it, I guess.  Just sad I didn't just hang out and do nothing.  Oh well.
Yeah.. I have an issue with being afraid to leave some of my plays uncovered sometimes. I'm always trying to maximize returns by having positions covered and collecting as much premiums as I can.
Me too, for sure.  I even try not to sell any when stuff is low, but around $220 the $245s seemed safely out of reach, or close to it, for the next week or two.  Cannot believe $230-$303 in two weeks.  Oh well.

Isn't that debt ceiling drama coming again in December?
I have to confess. I was once subscribed to fundstrat fsinsight
PLTR earnings 11/9 üëÄ
Nobody. Move. My Apple calls are starting to recover.
ngl didnt expect to be up 40k today from amzn position

its like early Sep again. but will i take the gains this time!?
Lock it in go buy yourself a frosty from Wendy‚Äôs
Congrats retard ü§ë
40k? You got day trades unlocked dude. Just take profit, wait for dip, play again.
fwiw ive been day trading amzn for a "living" for about 2+ years now.

lets just say results are mixed

(but i call it a win cuz i havent bankrupted my ass yet)
Y‚Äôall see LCID? üëÄüëÄ
Its an EV week, F, LCID, TSLA, NIO....
god it gets me so fucking hard knowing bears never win you soulless nerds
Buy NIO it‚Äôs still cheap
Anything under 60 is cheap. I‚Äôm holding to 500+. People on TV keep shilling about how 40-50 million EVs per year will be sold in 2030. Guess what?!? 60% of those sales will be China and NIO will own the largest slice of that pie while also profiting from other car companies using their GOVERNMENT MANDATED TECH they hold the patents for.
Hedge found keep shorting it
Yea well we know how that always ends for them. Death üíÄ
BBBY with no movement today
For real though if you‚Äôre not buying the company that literally renamed itself ‚ÄúMeta Platforms‚Äù when NVDA rocketed 13% off the *idea they will be involved*, you can‚Äôt be helped.
That‚Äôs what I keep telling people
Buying TQQQ yesterday was a good idea
Really hopin for a good power hour today
Same, would love a nice run so i could hedge my gains and potentially buy em back on a dip tomorrow
In break room at work casually browsing WSB eating pita chips
Right now the only undervalued company in this market is: Meta. Look at there Financial idk why you‚Äôd skip looking at.
ZuCk is EviL
Why? Cuz he runs a profitable company? And can‚Äôt control what people do on his platform? It‚Äôs like blaming Tim Cook for all the bad shit you get using your iPhone
Just gonna look at Tesla again EOD and either cry or jack off
tears make good lube
Just gonna look at Tesla again EOD and jack off
I somehow manage to loose 2K on this bull run, this only means I'm doing everything right?

F yeah  QCOM & NVDA.  looking fwd to next week Q3.  whats on da menu retards? ape on!
> You're a fucking idiot.
Buy more Qcom or hold what you have, it‚Äôs nowhere near where it should be still. Sell nvidia it‚Äôs expensive right now. I‚Äôd grab Nvidia under 200
me during summer: whew i can finally afford NVDA leaps again

me now: wait what
I turned off logic and rebuilt my portfolio in Aug 2020 and Feb 2021. Market pulled back hard within weeks and I lost a shit ton. Still haven't recovered even a fraction.

I buy puts at the beginning of Oct 2021 and shit has literally gone up 30-50%.

How can I honestly believe timing is not everything?
Doing a welfare check on that guy who was spamming Comcast DD multiple days in a row a few weeks ago. Anyone know if he is still alive?
He ded
Is penn a buy? Seems like he secretly videotaped but can‚Äôt release cuz a crime lol
PYPL should be a good holiday play. Plus they're going to allow you to buy stocks on Paypal soon so that should be good.
Waiting for a reversal for CALLS!
I thought I was supposed to work for 40 years and then retire
What do we think, FB gonna sympathy surge with NVDA to 340 tomorrow?
> I'm not sure, but I think Facebook is going to rally.
Fluff blowing off, FB to rally again nicely, this is the Metaverse rally just getting going...love him or hate  him., Zuck's on the up.
Fuck yeah.
AMD will be 150 by end of next week
God bless JPow
GME do $300 pls or at least that $250 thing from yesterday
Calls?
Not till next week I'm afraid
I guess there‚Äôs always some company or sector that‚Äôs going to prop up the SPY. Always so much red but it‚Äôs always green. Today it‚Äôs semiconductors. Always something.
the guys running spy must know in advance what to dump and what to pump, otherwise it cant be nonstop green
Holding DKNG going into earnings, Penn and Caesar‚Äôs rely on actual in person gambling and their expenses are up. DKNG is online and won‚Äôt get hit as hard
Dumpkings will dump for any reason what so ever
Bet
I did 40p-11-12.
I got 51c 12-3
Short the VIX
[deleted]
I also bought calls on a stock in hopes of it pumping at earnings. Good luck bro
SQ calls for earnings? What strike you guys think?
Yes
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
Is uber gonna moon or doom. I missed all the earning moons.
ok sold one of my NVDA 200c 6/17/2022, $2.25k -> $11k  
  
I have another one. Do I sell it, or should I wait and exercise later?  
  
i am just a retard ape, i just buy stocks that look cool, i have no clue what im doing.
Sell it and Buy a cat
Cats are cute but I don't want the responsibility lol
Fair enough - buy a trip to Vegas
I'm gonna spend a few grand of it and then reinvest the rest
I‚Äôd sell both and take a breather guy
Let it ride
yea i've been considering that given I already have more than double my original investment from selling one
Just hold it and walk a stop loss up behind it.
Thanks to a few bad plays, ROKU, PENN, QCOM, DKNG, HUT, AMD I blew up my theta gang account.  Shit took me down -18% in 2 weeks.  Margin gangbanged me so good this morning that I am done.
How can u be down on hut
20 Short calls 11/19 at $15 sold a few weeks ago when HUT was trending down.  Proceeded to run up that Margin came calling.  Rolled em out to next JUNE.
Did they at least lube before sticking it in?
NVDA‚Ä¶ nice.
Surprised at the lack of Moderna loss porn today
I played it safe with a December call for Nvidia instead of yolo on a weeklie. Difference between 200% and 15000%
Don't forget the strong possibility of a -100% too which is why you chose the later expiration. Don't feel bad, I bought shares instead of calls lol
Yeah true definitely wasn‚Äôt expecting $40 in a single day
Yea I just sold my shares. 17% in one day on shares, just going to take the profit and think about what to do next. Hit my price target of $300 like by EOY way early.
PyPL is getting old. Anyone here still in? It‚Äôs been killing me.
Just jumped in, don‚Äôt think it can get lower than 225 ü•≤
Yeah got a bleeding leap on it
Pain, but pain together

BB really shit the bed today
PENN dumped. Big over reaction. Easy buy for some easy gains.
why is AMD up a good chunk today
Proximity splash damage from NVDA QCOM. Big money piling into the sector.. except INTC
All semis are up not named INTC.  But AMD probably more because NVDA is going to Mars  today.
It's AMD. GET IN NOW.
Why don‚Äôt I own any NVDA?  Fuggg
Why don't I own more NVDA? Holy fucking jesus.
wtf it just keeps going üò≥
Anyone buying sporting good dip
Nope. Sold at 39.I think this dip was sir Jack exiting. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Nobody mention Amazon, money maker today
AMD has room to run. Don't be that guy left behind. üòÇüòÇ
NVDA goes up $8 and the puts I'm looking at barely budged. I hope NVDA goes to 500 by end of next week to put those bears in the poor house.
PTON puts is too obvious, right?
I grabbed some to go with PINS
Remember IV crush. You need a big move to make money unless they are leaps

Are people holding Nvida calls seriously
I am.
Sold a AMD 150c expiring tomorrow for 0.16, hope it doesn't get exercised
You either made a lot today or lost a lot hahaha
holy FUCK nvda
Ready to get buttfucked by sq earnings tonight. Bring it uncle Jack.
Nah it‚Äôs gonna be great. Just watch.
I‚Äôve got 4k in calls riding on it, so it better be.
The real giga Chad is the analyst that upgraded NVDA , saying Metaverse is NVDA chance.

Then he look at the stock price today, holy shit guys.
Anyone looking at DKNG?
Yeah fuck them. If they don‚Äôt go up double digits tomorrow I‚Äôm done
In DKNG leaps for 1/23 and CSP 50 for 11/19. Bullish on them, they are being dragged down by Penn.
Got calls, but torn if I should add or reduce
Don't worry, once AMD's merger is complete it'll also run up 50% in a single day
ngl i totally forgot about AMDs merger.  Hopefully the IV calms down some before that closes
Well fuck, rip Nasdaq for today
Sold my nvda in the morning , GUHHH
Fuk
nvda power hour lets go dont sell off
should i buy an NVDA call to get it to come down? A noble sacrifice perhaps
was so tempted to buy +20 call options when nvda was at $295 lmao, fuck
imagine thinking we will crash any time soon when we literally had one last year
Well I bought the Nvda top. Fuck
I should stopp trading till I can identify a ten bagger
Sold the top for once
Even Bezos printed today wtf how am I losing munny
Pls Nvda come back
Quick 35% on nvda puts F u
if any OGS are around this reminds me of the time when Softbank bought a shit ton of tech calls, prepare for a pullback
It feels 100% the same
When Softbank san sold NVDA, it crashed 50% after that
Come on Nvda punch power hour
PENN is a buy IMO. These stories seem like bullshit and it‚Äôll rebound hard.
since nvda is the new spy we doing calls or puts for EOD into tomorrow
Shares
Just got burnt hard on nvda
If you‚Äôre not buying at the top, you‚Äôre not a true WSBer
I need F and CHGG to fuken MOON now. I HATE seeing shit go down as soon as I buy it.

I have a feeling imma regret selling my rkt calls
CVNA calls for tonight?  ü§î
DKNG thoughts? I‚Äôm debating weather to gamble on this earnings.
IV is too high break even to high naaa
Don‚Äôt shoot the messenger if they beat earnings, but every article I read said this is their weakest quarter historically for some reason and some other info I can‚Äôt recall was negative too leading people to believe they won‚Äôt make it
I don't know what to do, so I might just buy SPY calls.
I'm breaking up with Cathy if she doesn't send me more feet pics

Whoa how many times did ROKU say the N word on their earnings call?
$BROKU
Market so detached from reality. JPow ultimate hype man! Ridiculous as fuck.

So anyway, SPY 470c FDs
its a mini mania. come on dude. Markets dont always necessarily reflect economic conditions.
it's completely detached from economic conditions at this point. 100% gains in 18-months if you bought SPY at the bottom of the March '20 covid dump $230.

now $460+ is 100% gains on a fucking indexed ETF in 18-months!!! 'mini-mania' is a bit of an understatement
So what? just ride the wave. We know its inflated. You and me know it will retrace.
Not sure how this happened but I bought vti 250c 11/19 !!  Down 75% but I have a feeling these will print.  Now that is fkn crazy if it actually does print.  You gotta love the excitement of the market right now.  I lost a shit load of $$ in fucking September as many did I‚Äôm sure but I‚Äôll make it back and hopefully make some profit as well.
take your 25% and start over. this cannot be sustainable. whales pumping everything and will dump on retail just like before. careful
Appreciate the advice.  Normally I would say yes if it was a large amount however I bought these for 5 bucs per contract and only got a few of those.  I‚Äôm gonna ride them out.
Reality: Low interest rates, infinite QE, inflation.

Effect: Stonks go up.

Where is the disconnect? There is none. This is reality.
yes, that's correct. until it's not

we are not in a bubble at all. NVDA is perfectly normal price action
Its gpus went triple the retail price. Gpus are in such hot demand that im surprised its this low
Ya but NVDA doesn‚Äôt make more from gpu selling 3x by scalpers. 

It also is facing major production issues.

I had it drop 40% on me during the Trump trade war.
Took me a while to realize that as soon as I book a big win I need to transfer the money somewhere else or just buy a fuckton of spy.

lol I remember a couple weeks ago I was thinking "no way SPY hits 465" and here we fucking are thanks to TSLA
Yes Tesla was a huge help but all the underlying stocks have made a difference too and not just the big ones
actually ive seen data showing otherwise. Around 90 % actually lost about 10% or more from all time high.
> I do not know what this means.
Just remember, Tesla share holders get Starlink at IPO price.
I pray he wasn‚Äôt joking about this‚Ä¶. Also I‚Äôm curious when the record date would be. Im slowly selling off my tesla position because i cant in good faith look at a 20bagger and not take profit
> Today is the record date.
I dont think he was joking but yeah i dont know what the record date will be. Id guess it would be after an official announcement but it also may be long term holders.
God i hope so, ill go so balls deep in it if i can
> You can't do that.
Somethign hype like that will IPO at 100B+ valluation and the company will never book a profit in it's existence. space will not be profitable for atleast 25 years you fool.
Its not space related, its a communication business... Who is the fool here?
you for thinking anything elon related would IPO at a fair valuation
Well you are kind of reenforcing my point that Starlink at IPO price is a good deal....
Since when did profit matter in this market?  ü§£
it doesn't matter now, but in the future it will.. You can lie to yourself if it makes you feel better though
would you buy amazon 25 years ago?
What the fuck does a retail outfit have to do with satellite internet
I dont know why you ask me?
No I downloaded it though.
yea but amazon wasnt 100B valuation 25 years ago you nimwit.

There will be a time but momentum is favoring the bulls. Don‚Äôt count the bears out.
The 60th record close favors bulls, and has. Buy calls
Goddamn, read up on the history of NVAX.  It is such a dogshit company...over 30+ years w/o a new drug in its entire existence.  Multiple failures, multiple failed promises on which they never deliver, reverse splits and multiple dilutions.  Huge cash burn.  They're well behind the pandemic that will probably be over by the time they'll be able to manufacture anything.  Thank god their C-suite gets $100M in bonuses though, courtesy of the USG and taxpayer dollars....bonuses they can get without being required to actually even deliver a COVID vax.
I mean at least they aren‚Äôt J&J with the biggest lawsuit loss ever 3.9bn
I mean at least J and J makes and sells actual products and has revenue. At least J and J has successfully conducted clinical trials. NVAX promised a SARS vaccine.  NVAX promised an ebola vax.  NVAX promised a MERS vax. They promised a flu vax. They promised a RSV vax.  They've delivered nothing.....we are still waiting for those infections disease vaccines over a decade later.  NVAX constantly offers shares to dilute then reverse splits.  Then hypes up a 'new' vax for the latest emerging bio threat, money pours in on hope, they offer more shares, but then never deliver.  Then rinse and repeat for the next emerging threat. It's truly remarkable they've been able to run this scheme for over 3 decades.  They were about to be delisted from the market  right before the pandemic because that's how bad they were doing.
I would rather have never than someone who has violated manufacturing protocols on Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec, Visine Eye Drops and other products. ASR hip resurfacing, Physiomesh,  Gynecare transvaginal mesh kids, Pradaxa and Xarelto, and of course talcum powder. Vaccines or any medication should not be a race of the drivers have a higher crash record than David Gilliland who has crashed on average 3x a year since 07 in NASCAR.
Lol, the reason nvax can't diver shit is because they can't manufature anything.  You'd rather have the company fleecing taxpayers while delivering nothing in order to enrich themselves with $100M bonuses. Gotcha.
I‚Äôd rather have none to be honest.
They report at close, and I assume investors are spooked by Moderna's move, so they'll likely wanna lock in recent gains.
Ford getting ready to test $20!
Tsla 1300 EOD ?
With the hype 4 sure

That's just a buying opportunity. Tesla always goes higher
Remember last year when he said it was overpriced? Then a few months later it skyrocketed and split? 

Same same, but different

It is just a matter of time!
He will he always does

TSLA bers are fuk  


That's me. I'm fuk.
cant believe i missed out on NVDA. this actually hurts
It is going to keep running until earnings though not $20 a day
It‚Äôs impossible to find an entry because it just keeps going up üò≠
Those 280-290c premium yesterday was 8-9$ ong i did miss the train was look at it but thinking to myself it has ran up a lot in the past month but forgot that there no all time high it already broke
I have a banbet to win buy TSLA please everyone
Can't stop, won't stop #NVDA
I've learned my lesson on TSLA puts they are no bueno
Everything is undervalued. PUMP MORE
RKT earnings gonna be massive. Heard they‚Äôre adding a fleet of EV‚Äôs
If you had bought nvdia weeklies like a true psychopath you‚Äôd be filthy rich today
If i yolod on them instead of spy id be buying a house in the next month
If only you were a fortune teller. Go learn that skill
Basing all my trades on tarot cards now, got it
I‚Äôm happy with my monthly gains lmao. If you‚Äôre in the habit of buying weeklies you‚Äôre gonna lose it all.
Lmao i don‚Äôt buy weeklies but just saying every once in a blue moon‚Ä¶.
Why is it up so much
Metaverse rumors is what i heard, not sure if true
feels good
You did not buy weeklies‚Ä¶. Did you
hell yea 260c last friday, 265c tuesday, got another one at close yesterday premiums were only ~3.50 or so
Why the fuck did you buy those? Hella good for you man. Did you catch a bag?
appreciate it! just got lucky i guess, nvda weeklys did well for me last week, also i got tilted from APPS earnings massacre so was looking for some high upside plays to make me whole. sold early around 290 this morning didn‚Äôt think it would keep running
> I bought BCH at an average price of $14,000. It has since fallen to a low of $4,300 and is now trading at around $5,400.
You‚Äôre a genius visual mod
I had sex with portnoy and he was always a gentleman. He always sent me such nice dick pics.

Did you send nice dick pics back?
Daily RSI on NVDA has never been this high, and on the Weekly is approaching the previous high.

It's extremely overbought at these levels. Waiting for a pullback. I won't let FOMO get me this time!
*cries in 400 AH*
Lol I wouldn't even be surprised in this ü§° market.

Either way there will be other opportunities. I just picked up FB last week and GOOG yesterday. Both great companies at better valuations than NVDA. Just gotta be patient!
NVDA not gonna stop
I'm a perma bull but the euphoria in this market is scary af. Companies adding $100 bill to the market cap on no news. Way too much money sloshing around in the market
NVDA can't be stopped
I FINALLY DID IT. I FINALLY PAID OFF MY STUDENT LOANS WITH $NVDA AFTER SHILLING THEM NON STOP LFG
Gz successful shilling
fucking sellers selling NVDA. Just buy more.
Nvda wouldn't surprise me to see 400 before earnings.
Stop! You‚Äôre making me so hard üò©
Im dead serious too. No wsb bullshit lol.
As soon as Tesla starts falling of course there‚Äôs another new piece of news

It‚Äôs like a propaganda machine
What‚Äôs he doing now?
New wave of GME bagholders are graduating.
ü§£
SPY 471 AH
Everyone agrees that TSLA is overvalued but no one is willing to buy puts on it
Yeah because you don't buy puts on a stock with this much strength
Go ahead
FACE THE LEAD!
Fresh NVDA bagholders unite!
am here with so many calls haha
My logic says it is gonna be dump day for spy.

But the reality is, spy is gonna go higher every hour.
Sold my GME Monday for $200 which appears to be a bit early but I put it into SPY 460c weeklies so I hope it keeps going.

TSLA you think you‚Äôre being cute rn? Cause you are ü•µü•µ
Put options are actually the worst ever investment
I honestly believe NVDA can be the most valuable company in the world
How can NVDA be worth more than TSM ? Dumbest shit.
Just because TSMC makes them? There is a lot more than just the actual fabrication of the good that goes into the price
There‚Äôs no company on earth that will ever have the intrinsic value that alibaba does until something truly revolution comes but it‚Äôs more likely they will be a part of it not being disrupted by it. Too big to fail and too profitable to fail
VOO up 2% since buy-in.

Already paying more than my yearly savings account üòé
Switch to VTI
Thanks for the good tip, kind WSB stranger.

What's your thoughts on VXF?
> I'm not interested in VXF.
VTI already exposes you to mid and small cap. Dollar cost average VTI and VXUS for long term wealth building.
I'm going to open an roth IRA account next yr and replace VOO with VTI. Thanks for watching out. üëç

GME looks like it's getting ready  for another run today
Another up and down?
Ok so puts at noon
A reasonable play when it spikes...but you never know how high it can go. And one day it will run and not stop
It is somewhat weird, normally it would bleed out to 200-190 by now after the run up.
Nvda really going to 300

SAVA MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!
Wtf happened
Journal confirmed the Western Blots were legit. It was the most serious allegation made by shorts.
Lol we've had 16 straight days of SPY going up. When ever this rug pull happens shit is gonna be wild
I‚Äôm literally keeping straight cash and only doing calls in the morning lmao

Buying meme stocks and selling covered calls is so much less stressful than dealing with options. Good lord I wish I had been paying enough attention to do this shit earlier.
selling CC's on GME at $450 is basically robbing incredibly stupid people of money they have no business having
Yeah, CCs on meme stocks is the way to go if you don't give a shit about the company and are okay with your shares being called away during a rally.

It's literally free money.

Wheel it and sell some cash-secured puts as well
> and are okay with your shares being called away during a rally.

And when that happens, you'll see tons of individuals regretting they sold CCs, yet they understood the "risk" of capping their profits. You'll see it all the time when a meme stock pumps, several threads always get posted over at /r/thetagang, consisting of "what do I dooo, I didn't think meme stock would pump"
Been there. I was wheeling AMC back when it was in the $9-$10 range.

Definitely sucks when it happens!
Yeah but you give it a few weeks and it goes back to its holding position and you buy back in. Shits fucking stupid how easy the money is
>but you give it a few weeks and it goes back to its holding position and you buy back in.

*looks at AMC* not quite in this case lol that shit priced me out pretty fast

But I get what you're saying. It's one of the easiest option moves to both understand and make money on.
The apes have made me so much money. Delusions can be profitable.
I been seeing people yell TSLA is overvalued since it was $200. Yet every new person that says it thinks they are the genius who has timed the top
I've been saying it was at the top since I sold it in August.  I finally accepted that I am wrong and bought back in today.
Battery technology will be the most important and valuable tech of this century
Right, all they have to do is a stock split and it won‚Äôt be priced so high anymore. Easy peasy.
Another split would be a dream
[deleted]
Exactly what happened with me but from 1 $100 272.5c that turned into $3300 which I sold for $1200 today lmao
That's how apes go bankrupt lol.
You would have never held to 100k. Don't beat yourself up about it. You'll never go broke taking profit
Same here I‚Äôve been depressed all day sold around 275 and now this‚Ä¶should‚Äôve gotten back in waiting for the dip now (if there is one). What price did you get back in?
I wanna cry üòû
I am crying
Sorry bro, need a shoulder?
Yes, and a time machine if you‚Äôve got one.
I am going to die poor.

this is a ban bet
NVDA top buyers in shambles
literally, just destroyed like 17k in gains ive built over the past 3 months
How can you look at a company that‚Äôs basically gone vertical most the day and day yep now‚Äôs the time I buy.
i was doing little day trades of $5-10 otm calls and selling whenever they hit 1-2k profit and the last ones i got were 320c about 25 minutes ago
Ooff
That is me
Spy 470 11/15 calls? üëÄüëÄ
I've got a couple 480c for that expiry. I sold off some at 50% to cover my cost and my remaining are up about 75% overall.
Say what you want. NVDA 350 tomorrow.
Mods move nvda to its own thread
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/majorhassel (0/1) made a bet that PYPL would go to 260.0 when it was 244.995 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

sell it and ask for a pardon. I've done it once on robinhood and they helped me
Same boat. Just waving at each other from the sinking ships
It‚Äôs not chill
Move your Nvidia tendies into FORD
why? $F has been ramping up the whole week.
Rivian IPO next week. Ford announced they have 12% stake.
ooooo... excellent
Moreeeeeeee
Why
TSLA will soon push to ATH of $1337/share.  Musk will tweet 'lol 1337 dude' sending the stock soaring to $1420.69/share.  He will then tweet 'thinking of taking tesla private at $1420.69/share.'  


hope you're all ready for the ride!
Honestly who‚Äôs holding TSLA overnight I‚Äôm up 1.5k lmk
You‚Äôll be down 1.5k by morning.

I'm both bull and bear but right now I want my bear side to win. I find this non-stop rallying nauseating
I feel the same - everyone is getting rich on the ret@rd market while both my calls and puts have failed
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
it will plateau and have a pullback.
It will rub the lotion on its skin and do this whenever it's told
Yes sir! dont hurt me, ok? big daddy?

If that's the only reason you think it's going up, where have you been?
Now do Tesla then get back to me

First season was one of the greatest ever. Sylar was a great villain.
I remember struggling and playing NVDA calls weeks ago when it was stuck $200-$210 now it‚Äôs $270 legit WTF. Kills me I didn‚Äôt just get far options and wait :(:(:(
Sitting on money is hard and hindsight‚Äôs 20/20. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up
Get in 400c 6/17/22. When you get rich, take your wife out to a nice dinner and take a shot for me

It‚Äôs possible ?

Fuck you, Game store
F was a mistake you fukin assholes
I'm no bear, but there is definitely a dip coming sometime soon, right? I want to be balls deep in cash and when it bottoms out and then be balls deep in SPY calls, but for now we're just steadily mooning every day. I'm not buying the top again, I've done that too many times dammit.
take it easy ?

goddamn I hate fidelity for making me trade with only settled cash. fuck your good faith violations. thinking about going back to the HOOD smh
Same with E*TRADE this is bullshit
I got myself locked into that until the new year with schwab as well. Been missing out on so much, and it's painful. Trading needs to catch up with the times.
just enable margins on Fidelity but don't trade over your cash balance? It takes 4 seconds
Just convert to a margin account
imagine blaming the broker for not knowing the difference between account types.
get a margin account.
People seriously bitching about TSLAs evaluation and just straight up ignore the fact SPY has never even released a product and it's valued at what??? Yeah ok
SPY CEO tweeted they were laying off 25% of staff after making some bad calls
Lol wot mate
I know right like what do they even sell spy gear?
I think TSLA should go up
We may have witnessed the top for the next ten years this morning. Or at least until tomorrow.
do you know the time
Tomorrow? Probably 9:30 am

This past couple of weeks I have purposefully avoided the stock market and just focused on trying to get a better job in life. Honestly so much less stressed out now. The chase is addicting.
get a better job to have more money to throw into the stock market... good plan
Nice
Why can‚Äôt I just catch a 10 bagger when I put in $5k ?
it‚Äôs always with like 300$ then when 5/10k deep red
I need NVDA to put me over the day trade limit. Going to put everything I can into 350$ calls for earnings

Looked at NVDA this morning 
 and thought, yeah its done for today. Also sold AMZN yesterday and GOOGL at open. In case anyone is wondering, I'm holding SQ into earnings. Yall might wanna sell.

Edit- also doubled up on BB at open. Wtf

Bruh nvda calm down. Geez

How is it remotely healthy

I love/hate NVDA. It's always been there for me before but I was afraid to buy into it this morning. "There's no way it will keep going. No way at all." Here I am covered in semen and regret.

Edit - congrats to the retards that were grabbing the tail of this glorious rocket ship. May your tendies never end.
Who ISNT making money today?? This market is ridiculous. If you aren‚Äôt making money today then you should give up.
:(
If this month hasn't convinced you we're in the middle of hyperinflation, nothing will.

Why? Because market went up?

You mean go down to 200? Or what?
It‚Äôs a very slow very big ship. It‚Äôs like Drax. You don‚Äôt even see it move it‚Äôs so slow. Yet here we are at 150. And every time you glance at it, it‚Äôs in a different place. Huh, when did aapl get 160? Wtf, since when is aapl a 170 stock?? Such an overpriced stock at 200!!

Okay.

Let‚Äôs see, can‚Äôt wait.
I did not have enough calls for this week
Do you usually buy in the money or out the money calls?
Either ATM or just OTM. Sometimes way OTM for a bit of a lotto ticket
I usually buy ATM spreads with a 10 width because theta scares me.
ATM or slightly OTM
Barely otm
Deep ITM
ATM
Way otm calls are lottery tickets. If you are new buy ITM so they have some inherent value and you can get out easier if it goes pear shaped.
Like 3 or 4 bucks otm.

Was a fucking hair away from Buying the MSFT dip. Fack.
Wtf even is SAVA
Alzheimers treatment biopharma company.
Oh yes sava
TSLA just needs volume
It‚Äôs up 40% in a month how much more pump
Do you want from it. It‚Äôs resting
https://youtu.be/Ickn8iipxUc
yo chill the fuck out nvda
Threw 1k at SAVA right before the halt fuck yes!
Same absolutely loving it!
Aapl is mad annoying
Need to buy something with less or no profit. Apple makes money and has billions in cash. Really bad things.
QQQ most overextended I‚Äôve ever seen
Why is sava going up
Meme stonk I'm thinking
!banbet AMZN @4000 in 50 days
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.

Ford leaps printing
Ford everything printing
FUCK ME I WANT MORE NVDA CALLS
You in FB yet or waiting until the full sub shilling starts at 350?
ive been in since the dip
fellow SAVAges, 

is there any way it holds near 80 as support? or is a fall back to the 40s imminent?

Wondering if i should scalp profits now and reenter...
Ask yourself, why would it drop back to 40
Uhhh, I think you‚Äôre looking at triple digits minimum. The only reason it was near 40s was because of a hit piece alleging they falsified data. The news today was that they did not.
Wait till news. I have calls expiring Jan 2022 that I‚Äôll probably sell around 120 if it gets there
yeah i couldnt even find news on why its been pumping recently. i entered as a long play until they potentially get phased 3 approval over a year from now. just hard to ignore 100% gains
This is just the start of our trip to Mars. I don't think it'll fall below $100 again
SPY GOING UP, ON A THURSDAY

GOT YOUR PUTS OTM AND THEY LOOK GAY üíØ
somehow got 1200 shares of SAVA before the halt.
Yikes. Good luck
Hmm, wondering if it is time to take Etsy profits, up 70% since May.
Half at 100%
Sava Nov 12 100 filled at $1 ü§£
It might be confirmation bias, but I see $PINS going way way higher tonight.
Somebody else was saying they‚Äôll tank and I asked why because all I saw was good news. He didn‚Äôt really have an answer.
Man I had 11/19 121 AMD calls last week that I sold for like 10% profit. Would be 200% by now.

Better than red I guess
This is natural ü•¥
gotta love TDOC‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt have to worry about supply chain impacts
Oh look it‚Äôs ‚ÄúBen Simmons is still an emotional lesbian‚Äù o‚Äôclock
Took a little L on Tesla hopped in 0dte nvidia calls I‚Äôm not disappointed
SAVA pls keep ripping
SPY literally only goes up
It is known.
Thanks for the 110% gains SAVA. I have no business being in it longer...taking my profits.
Congrats. Well played my friend.
best day my porty has had in ages, the old rare double whammy of currency gains and stock gains, the stars have aligned.
Calls on pre-foreclosures notices
I might get one of those when were at the signing table in a couple weeks!
Imagine a wsb DD leads to an actual moonshot and not a P&D
Like SAVA did just now
It used too

Mr krabs i have failed you. I made it all then lost more than I gained.
You and 99 percent of the people here.
mods SAVA hit 100 check the chart wheres my ban bet
TSLA needs to do what NVDA is doing
I hate NVDA holders. Congrats you fucks
It's starting to get cruel to keep giving the apes hope every other month like this
Nvidia is a joke, gratz tho to all retards holding it
Indeed a joke, trading for 30x sales, 95 P/E and $650B market cap. Not even a SaaS company
Why joke gud company
Amazing company, ridiculously overvalued
Anyone playing mrna?
Calls on everything ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
NVDA with the retarrt strength
Coin base puts it is

NVDA 300 eow?
Wrong way NFLX.
PSFE you are the unwavering red rock in an ocean of green.
Not me selling tesla calls for a loss yesterday when if I waited I would have made money and then buying tesla calls today to lose money.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Sava Boys we up!
I hope elon sells shares to save my pu...err... save hungry people
Is Tesla hiding the rocket today? 

She‚Äôs acting bashful.
1250 EOD suddenly doesn‚Äôt seems so far off
Should I go 468call?
I did up 20% already
I sell too early..because I am scared.lost a lot money few days ago
Fuck it its just money on a screen it doesn't really matter
i want to say thank you to nvda for making my week
Made my monthly salary today
QQQ is just insane.
It truly do be
QQQ ü§ëü§ëü§ë
X25 RKT $18c 11/19 before earnings tomorrow
I have 10. In this together babyyyy
Let‚Äôs go! That tiny pump earlier gave me faith that this just needs a little positive catalyst
So basically all those accusations against SAVA with data manipulation were proven to be false. All them hedgies with short positions about to learn a big lesson about smear campaigns.
Last time I bet on QCOM call, they fked me hard.  Now this time QCOM is up 11%.

Something hate me.
Fucking yes! That falling knife that I mishandled and has been stabbing me in the scrote for 3 days straight is actually green today finally. Now I'm only down 12%, everythings coming up Cleric.
sq will close 255 before earnings..book it
You gonna hold thru earnings? I need confirmation bias
There are so many red flags in the market right now it‚Äôs hard to count. TSLA, dog coins, memes, NKLA, etc all ripping. We know what‚Äôs coming next but we never learn.
We know what's coming next but what day tho is the hard part.
lmao NVDA at black mirror tier future built into it prices
Glad I sold my call for $500 that is now worth $1400 today
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
lmao i had a 460c 11/5 feeling real bad now
NVDA to Skynet future still to come.
Wow moderna got fucked
What is it at? Im to scared to look
I hate to be the one to say it but yer fked
Meh inheritance is fucked.
Nice price to buy back in though
Down horrendously to 4k, need a FD to either get it back or lose the rest
anybody try to quickly scalp like $10 to pay for lunch? or is it just me
Bought SPY 470p  11/12 for the next week. Wish me luck.
This man has balls!
What‚Äôs up with SAVA??
No sign of study tampering
They disproved the fake allegations. The data is not fake
huge shortage in yuca and I believe they have a monopoly
PYPL is way oversold. They are one announcement from mooning. Could be 235 EOD.
Days like today on SPY are a perfect example of why it‚Äôs dumb when people say not to buy options in the first thirty minutes
It‚Äôs so weird. You buy calls every morning at 9:30, you got a 50/50 chance at 30%-100% gains every time
Gimme another ATH daddy üòõüòõ
Threw $200 at Sdc hopium for a miraculu

When is SPY gonna burst
February
Early 2022
Switching from calls to puts last night was a bad move even for me
Oof. J-Pow tipped you off to a fastball being the next pitch, and you let it pass right by into the catcher's mitt.
Shoulda coulda woulda tossed more into Nvidia this morning but 80% profit is decent! Probs holding till the 12th or 15th to catch the earnings run up but not long enough to get iv fucked
Bought 100 shares of DKNG. NFTs are just printing money with 5% fees going straight to DKNG for just being a marketplace. NFL is a holiday season. Earnings expectations set super low. They don't really face any COVID downtime from having physical locations.
Alphabet 3000 today IMO
Fuck these AMD gains are making it hard to not nut.

$NET broke $200 baby
Wtf ETSY, earnings weren't that good
I like to buy spy at $10 increments. 

I missed $460, you think we could turn around for a moment?
You're the definition of psychological resistance/support.
Buying the dips = 401k that outperforms spy
You gonna be buying at 470.
well yeah, I buy every $10 increment
Lol that's why I said it.
Well yeah, I'm the definition of psychological resistance and or support
Pretty epic

How down bad is QCM right now!? They dropped their short report on SAVA yesterday. SAVA is up 100% this week
LOL, wonder if management was just waiting for some short douches to try and nab a win with puts just to announce the results they did today
If I was CEO that‚Äôs exactly what I would do. Genius. QCMs reputation is destroyed
they knew it was getting closer to OPEx and with the stock having started to rise QCM was probably thinking they could take it out to the woodshed
Yeah they saw it curling up and thought they could knock it down. This might blow them up entirely. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.
Good, after seeing Grizzly‚Äôs bullshit report on MP, who subsequently reports this afternoon, any of the fuckers that try to put out short reports to take our money need a good knee-capping
I paper handed my nvidia calls and it kept going up. Should I buy more?
If my OTM spy calls don‚Äôt print by EOD tomorrow I‚Äôll lose my mind
me down 80% on Zillow puts. gonna hold anyways cuz im stupid
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
You bought puts on a -25% day?
Bought puts yesterday morning. Was up like 6k. Held thinking it would go down further at open.Take profits when you can but I never seem to learn oof.
Ouch

DKNG insider sold a fuck ton of shares, now a dump pre-earnings? Expect this thing to TANK on earnings, wait to buy shares
I apologize to all of my fellow SQ holders. I strengthened my position three weeks ago and it's gone sideways/down since. I have failed you all.
Disappointed.
DKNG is the original HOOD rat
469.69 eod
Already hit 467, will probably be close by EOD...
I have a feeling we‚Äôre gonna sit near 466.64
Nice
Sava too moon
Surely TSLA can‚Äôt go much higher then this right ? Right‚Ä¶?
That‚Äôs what I keep on telling myself, and yet‚Ä¶
Did the Ford family just sell the top? WTF

Feels dumpy.
Tesla 11/05 1300c‚Äôs right here and sell em as soon as it hits $1265 at some point today.
We hitting that today??  Bought on what i tought was a dip.. but it kept on dipping
(Exaggeration) Probably won‚Äôt hit that but I‚Äôll bet it runs at some point today.
Thats what im hopium. Ready to burn a trade for some quick profit.
Okay I bought shares of Sava (üåà I know) now that they‚Äôre cleared on all the data allegations. If they can pull off reputable phase 3 trials, they‚Äôll be fucking huge.

Honestly I figured they were. I feel like VT has a nice balance between conservative and liberal politics, and it‚Äôs small enough that they can apply taxes more effectively with less corruption and waste.
It is. For me the only real downside is their largest town/city, Burlington as it's more of a college town

PSFE, HYLN worse.
V has entered the Death Cross. Somehow I've still made money swing trading calls.
Dis has been ass since april, i lost like 30k holding calls, this earnings may be something that can cause a run, but id def not risk too much. dis+ essentially lost its 'it' factor for the stock, i think the park numbers need to smash and a very optimistic/bullish forecast to make it move. but thats sorta just risky. i may buy some calls before ER though

When SAVA has squeezes like this is great news it tends to run for over a week. Lets GOOOOOO
Shorts need to fuck off, it's ready to blow but there's a huge amount of downward pressure
shorts are good, this is why it can run over weeks
Bought puts. Fuck this stock.

i'm up so much on amzn calls today all i can look at are NVDA what ifs

Anyone else still waiting for TSM to break out? 

Semis are on a rocket ship and the company that fuels that rocket has been petering along for almost a year now.
Is Taiwan out of that drought? I'd wait a few months until buying calls. Too many headwinds for TSM (though I do like them).
Thinking about SOXL puts it's well above it's channel.

It never got to 20 during 2020.
my fault.  i clicked 5 year by accident and moused over google's stock chart.
I wouldnt touch t with a ten foot pole. Dividends r also gay
What a joke I for the first time sold a call for a 20% loss because I‚Äôm practicing risk/reward but 100% If I let my calls slide hoping they will come back next day I end up instant loosing all my money. So I took a 20% loss yesterday and turns out AMD goes absolutely parabolic today would be up 800% if I just do the complete opposite of what I think I‚Äôm supposed to do
Just trust AMD and you'll be alright. It's been a really strong stock for years. It just likes to take naps
It was a weekly and I just didn‚Äôt trust the volatility it was just destroying it but of course today it‚Äôs just straight up with the no volatility. But I do fuck with long AMD calls it‚Äôs an awesome company I love AMD
Long AMD calls will treat you well.

Damn, well congrats on the move from last week

Alright retarded fellow APES lets go!!! 

Have 9 NVDA Calls... thoughts? Selling/holdl??!?!

4 NVDA21119250 1936% gain +17,287 (purchased 2.23)

5 NVDA220121C300 1141% gain + 10,926 (purchased (1.90)
If you have to ask, sell
rarely ask this is a unique situation but understand where you're coming from
Sell my guy. Don't get greedy
Not greedy more like potential of leaving a ton more money on the table. Not a MEME type situation ;)
Hang tight I believe we open big tomorrow
yeah I don't really ask upon my fellow apes but I did because I'm thinking the same thing. When most think it's going to drop after large gain is when it keeps mooning.
What do you think happens at open tomorrow? I think we are going to rip into next week
Natural reaction for most is "this insane rip today price has to drop" but not sure there's a lot of people getting in and think it's a front runner company to run fake world META and what better than NVDA? I could see it continue to rip tomorrow and definitely next week. I have a good amount of cash so may just hold and if it does dip add more shares. I can't see if it dips it dips much so lose some % in the calls but 5 of them expiry Jan22
Sell half, obviously then you made money, can pay taxes, and may still make a lot more money.
this is in a 401k so no taxes...for now ;)
Nice, but my answer is always to sell half when you're up 1,000%. Then no matter what happens you're only half wrong which is better than being all the way wrong.
true dat
sold my weekly 270 and 275 calls on the way up before it soared above $290, regret it a little bit but profit is profit. just sell and roll into more calls to hedge
hit / over 300!!!
My only regret was not buying more
nrds keep goin
Is tapering like circumcising?
Free money hack: strategize a fool-proof DD of a company, then inverse it. Inverse that, then inverse the original inversion.
Jesus portillos. I love your hot dogs but dayum
My lesson this week is to set TPs before going on work calls so I don‚Äôt miss my OCGN payout
Let‚Äôs gooooo nvda
Buying the top is my fetish
I‚Äôm still convinced FB is the play since the pivot. I just don‚Äôt have the best timing
FB is legit the future. METAverse is literally going to be the true internet 2.0

Gen Z going to be on that ASAP. Millenials will be hesistant but will def be curious.

Gen after Z (dont fucking know their designation) will literally grow up and be born into VR/AR integrated society. It will be like what cellphones and the internet are to us right now.

Net earnings call play?
When you guys buy calls or puts how long do you hold them because I only hold it for like 15 minutes and take my 15-30% I don‚Äôt trust long term. I got cheated on to many Times
Logical answer: whatever you're comfortable with.

Wsb answer: stop being a paperhanded bitch
Do the same thing. More control
Keep doing that. Greed will destroy your account. I never have gain porn, but I also never have loss porn.
LEAPS: Hold until a few  months before expiration unless news breaks out

A wise lesson. Just because you wouldn‚Äôt enter a stock because you think it‚Äôs too high is not a reason to short it. It will be obvious when to go bear. Usually takes a fuck ton of volume. Patience is everything

Hey before I do this, has anyone gotten PDT forgiveness via robinhood before?
Just put 25k in account, hold for day, instant presto
Apparently you can do it on the app one time without calling - somewhere in the settings
Before anyone else tells me, I do not have 25k to fulfill the requirements. Has anyone gotten pattern day trade restrictions forgiven before? If so, please tell me what I need to do

What is going on with BB today?  Weak as hell....on decent volume this time.
Buy opportunity.
Already maxed out.
Remember when 1.3% on the 10 Year was blamed for sending NASDAQ back close to 12k in February? Heh heh heh
> The 10-year Treasury yield is the rate at which a government borrows money for ten years. It's important to understand that this doesn't mean anything in terms of how much you'd pay on your mortgage or other loans, but it does affect interest rates throughout the economy and therefore has an indirect effect on borrowing costs for consumers and businesses alike.

$CHGG is at 2020 march crash prices. Unreal. Shorts are shorting it to oblivion so company needs to utilize 1 billion share buy back. They win both ways. Criminal
Anyone really think they'll even buy back? Prolly just use 200 for corporate bonus and the rest to buy some random streaming site
I can‚Äôt imagine a world where they don‚Äôt do a buyback if it stays here. They‚Äôre also sitting on cash
Torn on selling Tesla call or holding overnight.  Up 30%

It‚Äôs a somewhat risky play, at least in the short term so I only grabbed like 10 total but if you have a high risk tolerance and pick up a bunch of them you could really make out with some cash.
I think BB fucked the market's mom
This DD could've been helpful earlier.
Jesus PENN
Haha fuck Portnoy.
after a big gain i like to take a flyer on something random i read here that isn't the typical large cap tech or meme status, its almost always a net loss 

Even with that being said, I'm really looking back at my decision to dive into IWM with confusion and regret
RKT earnings. Getting goofy in here
It's that Friday profit taking spree I fear.
You're a good lad amazon, sorry for doubting
rblx rocket??
up a solid 15% today, feels so good
My first mistake was trying to make it make sense. Fuck you!
ETSY went from -10% to +15% overnight.
LCID is moving üíµüíµüíµ
Seems like NVDA is a buy and hold, any chance whales pull the rug? Copped a couple more shorter dated calls
Which one of you fuckers killed teller? Fucking Penn is looking ready to go full swan dive off the bridge
Guess Ford is going digging for moon rocks today
I‚Äôm already 30% up on my 500c for spy lol
FCEL 9.5 weekly's call volume today is 27K, 3 times the OI. The 10's have had heavy call buying today too.

FCEL currently at $9.30
Gonna start shilling Nokia on here since we‚Äôve forgotten
nvda 310 eod????
Bought a $20 F call for Jan 2022. Anyone else in it too?
F 20C  expiring tomorrow 55 contracts lol
F and AMD have done wonders for me this week. ü§©
Holding the 21c
have 5 10$F calls for Jan 2023 at 3.30 and 300 shares @ 3.30
Will I ever make money
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)
You either sell at open or buy at close that's how this shit works
yeah fuck that, Nov-Dec is money printer time
This method has been working for me no bs
true, im an advocate for @ closing. its a risk but damn, options printing if youre right.
Lmaooooo yessss fucking sir.
Now I just need a YouTube video with a clip of Dave Portnoy saying "Dave Portnoy is a rapist." That's in his response video looping over and over to make my life complete with these PENN puts I opened up for earnings a few weeks ago lololol. https://twitter.com/stoolpresidente/status/1456304657047896071 At 0:45 lololol
its down 20% in a day and you want more‚Ä¶. pigs get slaughtered
Oh I already sold and him saying it is in his response to the allegations.  I just want a video of the clip repeating him saying it over and over.  I'll have to make the video later.
Come on Amazon just another 2% baybeeeeeee
does DKNG have a chance in hell
Zillow, I‚Äôm going to beat your fucking ass.
I think this is the only time in my life I've been long VIX because people want to buy *calls*. It feels weird. I don't like it, necessarily.
At least the bears made an effort to fight back for a little while today, eh? Lol
Damn I just opened my brokerage app and there was a video of Theta fucking my bitch ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

From down $700 today to up $1500

dying to buy calls rn but i know i need to buy puts

fuck being gay af
I see NVDA $310 üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Whoever made that meme showing TSLA as a trojan horse for the S&P 500, well done, it appears your meme is accurate.

SPY is negative today absent TSLA.
Fomo nvda, it doesn‚Äôt give me a chance to buy dip. What can go wrong
Wtf are theee numbers on NVDA. 29,000% on ITM calls?
> The numbers on the Nvidia stock are called implied volatility. It is a measure of how much traders expect NVDA to move in the future and can be used as an indicator for whether or not people think it will go up or down.
NVDA going bonkers today
I'm realizing that maybe buying nvda calls when they're up 10000% is a bad idea
TSM calls all day until it‚Äôs no longer a good idea
NVDA is too strong, can easily reach 330 tmrw. It's like the day TSLA hit 1100.
lmfao @ spy 500c jan
Lmfao I got 10 of those let's go
God damn shouldn't have sold my 5 NVDA 265 11/5 calls yesterday
I shouldn‚Äôt have sold my 215c 11/19 for a loss one month agoü§°
I sold 10x 300c for 0.67

They are now worth 19 each... 

I hate myself
I missed out on nvda üòî
who's buying UBER calls & why
Jensen I can only cum so many times
BABA looking ready to explode up or down. 11/12 BABA 180c FDs looking good
There‚Äôs no more downside so up it is
bro diablo 2 been taking up too much of my time i never check my stuff anymore. i look for the first time today and i‚Äôm up 3k on just nvidia shares what the fuck is happening
Whose holding ABNB through earnings like a retard? <-- ME
Time to buy puts, this is too crazy ü§°
Kicking myself for not loading up on Nvidia leaps right after the split this summer. Had a feeling it was a good time to get in. Got a little bit but not nearly enough for gain porn üò≠
PATH intraday high üôèüòé
We eating. Such a slept on play. I think itll be $100 next ye
Yeah nothing but growth. Big risk is customers dropping off or unable to tap into existing customers to grow. Their customer base is all deep pocketed Fortune 500 companies
How do all my shares keep going down every day for the past 6 months and how do I still have money? Mysteries of life. If I had reversed all my positions would be up 200% since April.
The question is ‚Äî- do you hold your NVDA options? Mine expire 11/19. $315 strike. Hmmmmmmm
You must be retarded
Wait til they go ITM which at this point could be EOD lol
Someone validate my choice to buy PENN calls.
Cause I just bought 10 DKNG 55c's
I‚Äôm thinking about buying them as well
I did a month out at 60.
Holy fuck all positions are going brrrrrr thanks nvidia ++
My QQQ calls are up a few hundred percent. My
SPY calls? Not as sexy.
NVDA 300C up 200% about since buying at 10a.

FUCK YES!!!!!
Are you holding or selling before tomorrow?
03/2022, so im going to stay holding.

500 is gonna be incoming FAST.

the king of GPUs, AMD is flying with em <3
I sold 10 11/19 295 NVDA c last weel for like 1000 dollar profit and 10 01/21 300 c for like 4 grands bc I was stuck in europe and needed funds bad.

Today those calls are worth 70gs

End me.
every time I see "Why I'm worried about AMZN stock" videos on YouTube it compels me to buy more calls
Just swing Nvda calls for 30 seconds fastest 500 I‚Äôd make
Fuck it. Going all in on nvda 1dte 350c
This means we found the top.
Jesus AMD was offended by that MarketWatch article claiming the thrill was gone
well NVDA looks like u and me are gonna be friends forever
Is it worth hopping into NVDA and holding through tomorrow?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
NVDA on X Games mode
If TSLA surges for power hour, this will be the best trading day of my life, hands down
Vix and spy way out of sync, spy should be mooning based on vix plummeting, incoming spy dump?
VIX up 5%, QQQ up 1.5%, pull back soon??
All in Airbnb ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Went with PYPL instead of NVDA yesterday and I think I‚Äôm going to be sick ü§¢
I've believed in AMD for a long time, but damn I made a mistake. I sold my $110 calls a few months ago for $500 a piece and converted them to shares. Those would now be worth $30k. Fml
Live and learn. Next time different planüëçüèº
EASY SWING TRADING TSM
Yea swing trade to 180
ABNB so cheap my place has been solid booked now for the past 2 months.
I got calls earlier in the week after the car jump. They went up so much already I took profits ans rolled em forward lol. Let‚Äôs go for earnings!!!
Boys I got $100 left... what am I putting it on
NVDA otm FDs, this isn't even a question at this point
I have enough for 1 350c 11/5.  I'm ready let's GO
NVDA $350 FDs
far otm tesla puts
*Man, if I could only make this much every day*
Bought some intc fds for 0.01. Worst I lose $50 ü§°
look at COINs last earnings. next earnings on tuesday going to be huge, 400$ incoming
#AMD is next
So salty I don't own more chipmakers rn... holy shit...............................
**Bruh AMD has room to run in 2022 & 2023.**
NVDA‚Äôs got leading GPU 
But AMD‚Äôs got leading CPU & leading FPGA 

AMD price to sales ratio 11
NVDA price to sale ratio 34
**Buying calls now on** 

* DIA
* SPY
* AAPL
When AAPL turn?
My portfolio has been down 85% for almost the entire month of October...
My NVDA calls today just breathed life back into account üôèüèª
NVDA running so hard will be THE #1 2021 stripper name
LMFAO at RBLX. My 2 85c 11/5 that I bought for shits and giggles are up 200%
the RBLX 84c 11/5 I sold just gained 200% today ü§£ it‚Äôs still down 50% but godspeed to you
alright I'm gonna need a double cock from Mars for TSLA real quick so I can get out of these FDs
How do I accept that despite my market gains Pete Davidson is better with women than me?

Was I not bullish enough?
hes tall, funny and stoll richer than you why u surprised
He's on SNL. He's not funny.
You accept that women have bad taste in men and pretend like focusing on yourself will cure the endless crushing void inside.
Paul Pelosi portfolio doesnt miss
If we gambling let's load up on Penn right? I mean it's down 20% on not so bad earnings. It's an easy 10% pop by next Friday.
Thats what Im betting on
Nvda forgot the blunt at home the rocket laser will continue shortly
Oh thank god NVDA can go down.  Watch it go up 5% tomorrow tho
Thinking about this past August, when I was deciding between buying the dip in NVDA or V, and I picked V because I thought it'd be boring, but stable ü§°üò≠
V is the buy right now though while nvidia is the sell.
Nvda so crazy omg ü§™
Big daddy Jensen I love you. About to buy a 3090 and shove it up my butt.
But you are not supposed to mine with the 3090s
DKNG rising from the grave

Everything falling and Tesla doesn‚Äôt do shit smh
*Yank Yank, Yankity Yank*

AMD is still running.
Thank god my $NVDA calls are for January üò©

What are we thinking for power hour?
Spy.
The key is to figure out the next stock the big funds are going to pump; TSLA, NVDA, then what?

You know it's going to keep happening; same thing happened late last year.

Profit taking time
fomo always wins

NVDA
Last hour has been brutal for SQ
RIP my calls
Lol sorry guys I sold a nvda put, works every time
Sooo when is Visa a safe buy
Now
locked in amd gains. gonna buy more tmrw. logging off for the day
Bought my nvda for a loss last week. Glad I did this week
Come on NET, beat, raise, and tank.
Gamble big or go home
Made 100% returns on amd calls I bought this morning , they‚Äôre 1DTE but my dunbass feels like I should hold
Sold my dec calls. Ive been here before so taking profits as we go.
I'm in same boat with NKLA.  Probably close em.
Did the same as you today, ended up re buying $140s for next week.
Pton puts seem way too obvious. Inverse with calls? Fuck idk
I went big on puts even though it seems obvious. Zillow was obvious to
What just happened with Redbox? Shot up drastically and halted trading.
theyre selling EV's
Strike and date, I‚Äôll buy it right now
NVDA 12/3 375c
1d $600 spy
ASAN 150 12/17
Even SPY 550 11/5?
Wanted to go spy calls, but it's playing around too much. Staying cash until tomorrow
I think the only red day over the last 3 weeks of trading was like -.1%. Every other day has been bigtime green. Crazy
If that is the case, hasn't it been running a 3 to 1 ratio of Green to red?
Do we buy DKNG here or wait for under 40?
Both, just average down if you have to. Earnings are coming, if it tanks you'll only lose time not money
Buy
Yes
Feeling a 20% drop on PTON
Is trading futures gambling?
Actually better to get a grasp on but the fact that it‚Äôs always trading is bad for the degens
All of this is gambling to some degree.
What y‚Äôall think about DKNG? Got clapped today with PENN but I think it‚Äôs finna buss. NBA+NFL partnerships, heavy in to data analytics to drive business. 

1/21 40C
I am so fucked on mttr and nvda jesus christ
?
take me home
up 30% on my PINS NOV05 PUTS i bought yesterday -     

should i wait for earnings or take profit?
I just bought Puts at 2pm, idk, I think it's going to be a bloodbath
take some profit, and keep some, high chance it will drop
done and done - thanks for the advice... better to play it safe since apple is flat AF
Every tiny qqq dip gets snapped up. 200,000 shares sold a few mins ago and the stock just kept climbing. Love to see it.
tHOUGHTS ON amd FOR THE NEXT WEEK OR 2
With nvda and AMD being juiced, anybody think intl deserves a ride on the rocket?
Nobody wants to buy it
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
QCOM>intel. Qcom is priced like a value stock when it‚Äôs growing like a big tech stock. Intel is a boomer stock
Nice to see SAVA holding strong at $80, seems like it's for real and should keep climbing as product reports develop
Waiting for ah and premarket to kick in
I can‚Äôt wait to short coin. That fucker raw dogged me last year
How are we feeling about RIOT earnings YOLO?
Fully ready to regret holding my NET through earnings
ZNGA buyout lets. Hear it nflx

PINS $38p 11/5 DKNG $50c 11/5 ATVI $70c 1/21/22
I think I need to take a break, down 10% this week and constant headaches/neck pain

Today's SPY chart is a daytraders dream. It's ugly.
I want some LSD but it's hard to find $LSD

Somehow I've been losing money with all these companies flying smh
You should at least be breaking even right now.

Plz plz
Coingay earnings
Next Thursday
It‚Äôs next Friday
Okay
Next Wednesday
Next tuesday
Should I buy ROOT?
Wtf is wrong with apple today
That scary VWAP
No shot visa stays this low through the next week
My NET puts are about to leave me gaped, get the camera
I‚Äôd like to meet the retard pumping NKLA, or is it shorts covering?
Oh I really don't want to hold these DKNG calls through earnings come on.
It's almost definitely the wrong choice but I am too
It's only 165 options NBD, but looks like we bagging.
This market is just stupid
Apparently when *Night of the Living Dead* came out in 1968 the distributors neglected to copyright the film and it went into the public domain, meaning they didn‚Äôt see much if any of the $18 million the film made worldwide on like a $100k budget ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è That‚Äôs like $135 million adjusted for inflation talk about guh
Earnings Season is like March Madness 4x/year
PYPL CALLS looking juicy af! üëÖüöÄ
Visa extra juicy too
I think it is time I think about buying $BABA. As long as earnings aren‚Äôt a huge miss the bottom is in.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
Bottom was 140.
Yeah but I wasn‚Äôt sure then. It‚Äôs less risky these days to consider getting in.
The fuck is this baby dick sell off
You know it‚Äôs wild when you cough up a lung
Can SPY just sit the fuck down for once. Im sick of this manipulated fomo buying bullshit. At this rate msft and appl will be 4 trillion dollar companies by next year
I‚Äôm down
Sometimes i just wanna REEEE into the void
Why Manhattan?

Because I can easily get a taxi
and bagels
fuck it - uber calls
oh no he didn't!
BERS getting fuked today is confirmed. My options being down another 40%+ is also confirmed ü§°ü§ï.
How do people even attempt to daytrade with under 25k? Just getting locked into positions you know are shit and can't exit before the market closes because of PTD rules and good faith violations so the government can "protect you"? Sounds like playing on nightmare difficulty.
You can exit 3 times per week though
when your day trades refresh its like getting a life on HADES,
We take pride in playing on veteran difficulty 5 more thousand to break 25k on this difficulty‚Ä¶ for myself lmaooo
It‚Äôs difficult af. You get 3 a week. You can go cash account with TDA. 

Or you HAVE to buy longer dates contracts. Never get locked into a weekly. 1 month minimum. 

Also, never ever chase. Wait patiently for a dip at the bottom of VWAP and then gamble.
Down 98% all time I fucking know
you actually make more money on longer plays, who cares about buying and selling fast for 40$ lol
A fair number of people buy at close and sell whenever it‚Äôs profitable the next day. You‚Äôre still taking a lot more risk than being able to freely day trade, but you are able to exit your position.
saw a truck with huge stickers on the rear windshield and side panels saying shit like "UNVAXXED AND PROUD" and "REVOLT!" and "HOLD THE LINE!"

this is the cringiest timeline
Driver sporting a white goatee?
it was too far away and at a bad angle to see the driver. if that's any indication about how huge these stickers were. like literally the size of a nascar car's main sponsor
That's gonna hurt the resale when his family has to sell it to cover medical bills
dont worry he‚Äôll be dead soon lol or has breathing problems already

the silver lining of covid is that it either killed or permanently injured a lot of undesirable peasants
vaccinating for a mutating virus is so dumb because when it mutates you lose immunity. like flu shot, corona shot are obvious cash grabs and dont even help you. also vaccines cause cancer cuz the chemical preservatives, really they just want to cause more cancer, bill gates makes over 100 billion profit per year off cancer debt slaves in USA alone

I sold when it was at $311
lol i hedged my call way too early but locked in 300% gain even if they expire worthless. not even mad
Profit is profit. I haven‚Äôt been hanging around here too long but it seems like the people who lose money get greedy and don‚Äôt sell when they‚Äôre up even a modest amount. Once I get into 25% I start looking to sell.

But today I sat and watched as I made $1K in a couple hours. Was glorious
yeah ive lost enough by holding too long, cant be mad about being up just because you aren't up more
Exactly. I sold my $130C 11/5 this morning for a solid gain. If I had held I‚Äôd be up a lot more but whatever I can‚Äôt predict the future
It's okay $TSLA, you can gamma-squeeze those $1200~$1300 strikes tomorrow. You can moon when you feel like it.

Anyone‚Äôs Robinhood showing they‚Äôre down huge pre market even tho none of their holdings are down?
Mine shows that Vlad is thankful I went to Burger King
Did you try updating the app?
Yes, mine was showing something like a 60% drop last night. I restarted and after a few min it resolved itself. You may need to update as well as someone below mentioned
Mine shows up $0.01 cent.
They must have pushed some updates or something. Mine showed I was in a 54K margin call and I don't have any FD's that would leverage me that badly. I almost shit until I looked it over and realized it was their error.
Thank god it‚Äôs the app. I‚Äôm down more money than I can lose but now I‚Äôm realizing it‚Äôs their error

Can someone please explain why it rocketed after the tapering announcement? Shouldn't it be going down?

Was it already priced in, and after buyers saw there was no selloff are all jumping in? Or was a worse announcement expected?
He defined transitory and said economy strong
There was nothing unexpected.
Then why the rocket tho? Immediately after
I think relief.  They were expecting a lot worse I imagine.
The fear was it was going to taper down by like half in November. Jpow then said, and I quote:

‚Äúchill hommies, we are only slowing it down by a measly 10 bills. We are still gonna be buying like 110 bills a month of bonds, you‚Äôll barely even be able to tell the difference between that and the 120 bills we have been buying for the past 19 months or so. Take a hit of the blunt, buy some more calls, and shut the fuck up about the consumer price index‚Äù

It was actually a very moving speech.
Damn, wish I hadn't missed it üòÇ
I think Fed said they're reconsidering tapering if things are bad.
Rate hike was priced in, didnt happen
Thanks. This makes sense

#BUY TSLA and SPY or youre fucking üåàüêª
it's clear the big bois are pumping TSLA and NVDA.  You gotta believe they are desperate to cover certain other positions they've been shorting and/or handle new margin requirements that are kicking in. Congrats to holders but there will be a day of reckoning as great as the companies are.
This right here. If the only tickers flying are ultracorps, you should be worried.
Pelosi has NVDA calls.
Big boys pump Tesla. Tesla splits, Tesla runs again, big boys make more money, easy.
NVDA will be red tomorrow most likely, hope that I‚Äôm wrong üòñ
i hope so too FUCK
I said that for the past 2ish weeks. Lost a lot of money on puts. It just doesn‚Äôt stop. Not saying it won‚Äôt, but I don‚Äôt think it will tomorrow. I for one will be buying up any dips.
IV crush NVDA LOL
GME 8-k Fuck yes!!!
I have been a bear forever‚Ä¶. I changed to bullish recently and my portfolio is ATH. I‚Äôm sick it took this long honestly.
I‚Äôve been a bull my whole life but felt bearish all last month (guess how that went). Portfolio at ATLs.
Gay bears are turning bulls. This is the top.
Lolll yea probably
Not yet. Enjoy the blow off top to SPY 475-500 and then we‚Äôll start loading puts
I‚Äôm thinking this too
The market is insanely overvalued, but until now has proven that what is insane can become more insane, more insane, more insane.
I'm beginning to think I should read up on behavioral economics.
The system is broken. Rich investors make double, say they actually kept up with inflation, it's you who has lost half of the purchasing power. Yea fuckers your milk just got expensive.
BUY TSLA, BUY THE DIP
it shall be the tesla bulls that win this war
Who else has spy puts??
Jesus Christ I‚Äôm such a pussy for not getting in on NVDA
Nah I wouldn‚Äôt say that. No one in here has any actual clue why it‚Äôs running. It‚Äôs all hindsight.

And it‚Äôs up over 40% in a month. No one rational would expect it to have another 12% day.
It's cos well's fargo upgraded price estimate to 320 based on it's new ai space
it's running today because it got an upgrade from WF.

it's running this month because FB announced it will spend \~$10b on chips specifically from NVDA to power its metaverse.

it's running this year because there is an intense chip shortage and the company is the king of that hill.
There‚Äôs no way we could‚Äôve known it was going to pull a moon mission lmao. Any second it can lose half of its gains. So it‚Äôs okay tomorrow will be a better day with a different play
I prefer to use Robinhood over the other brokers
I hate their options layout. TD much better
ngl, if they had better portfolio watchlists and iras I‚Äôd have an ira there.
Sorry to break it to you guys but our award-winning analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now and NVDA wasn't one of them.

Thanks for the guy who said ‚ÄúHold the stock until you retire or find a new company to invest in‚Äù, AMD just hit 136 and I was going to sell at like 119 because it was the first time I saw big gains in my small time in the stock market. I‚Äôm not going to sell but seeing such a huge increase in unrealised gains made me feel real good, when I first got into the stock market all‚Äôs I saw was red and I thought it was going to be impossible to make any money. 

Feelsgoodman, even if it tanks to zero tomorrow I learned something valuable and all my trades have been green since I started learning about more holding through highs n lows. I‚Äôm looking out for me at 50 now not short term small gains that‚Äôll be gone in a month.
If you have shares in solid companies and have time, it's literally impossible to lose money. It's when you buy FDs in solid companies that things can go wrong.
The NVDA 300c was 5 dollars at close yesterday
Only one that bought those was Wells Fargos insiders who changed their PT from $245 to $320 Today
i saw 290 1dte in the am for like $100, i could of loaded but went with monthlies at 300, it was a matter of also having the balls, which i didnt lol
i bet there were a few retards here that grabbed them, that's a perfect degen bet
290cs were .30 this morning.
I‚Äôm holding these NVDA 325 calls overnight. Steak or MCD for dinner this weekend
nvda 300c went from $400 to 70k. nutz

i can only imagine how much they made who upgraded the stock and released the news fukining billions
You can't lose if you make the rules.
I'm a dumb piece of shit that just started trading options and have TSLA $1270 calls that expire tomorrow. Be real with me what's it looking like and am I fucked?
damn bro I think I sold you that call.
Pretty good odds. 50/50

Could fuk could Be the fuker
Idk why I did this. I was doing so good this year just buying/selling shares but was tired of the miniscule profits. Was getting envious seeing all of the gangbuster profits people were posting trading options. 

Had to dip my feet in and learn and some point but fuck.
I mean at this point today it‚Äôs 50/50 that it runs up or runs down end of day.  If it runs up end of day today, sell it
You think it'll make a big run tomorrow morning at open?
Hold if you believe in miracles
Pretty much, the Greeks are spit roasting you
You need it to go up 3.5% to break even. If you think that can happen then you're goochi
When did you buy them and how much are you down?
Honestly, I'd cash out.  Depending on premium paid you probably need around $1280 to break even?  Higher than that to profit? Theta is going to kill you
1278 but yeah

Fuck my ass like a drum. NVDA gonna be a roller coaster for the final hour.
Imagine not buying V calls when it‚Äôs just going to go up 15-25% in a month or two like it always does when some idiot bear causes one of these gap downs. Noones selling this low, whoever is trying to manipulate it is a fucking moron.
when is meta gonna get to $340 again?
How about a power half hourü§ûü§ûü§û
NET puts for literally a fuckin 50 bagger tomorrow
Why
Here‚Äôs my reasoning:

Once the price got into $140-$160 range, volume decreased dramatically yet now we‚Äôre all the way up at $200.

There‚Äôs been a decent amount of insider selling the past month by the CEO, CFO, COO, etc.

Institutions that got in at $100 (or less) are definitely looking to take profit.

Their market cap, for comparison, is 10x that of Fastly yet have less revenue, neither turning a profit. Fastly is definitely undervalued but NET is overvalued.

Analyst EPS estimate for Q3 2021 is -100% Vs Q3 2020.

Q2 saw them add 140 new customers with revenues over $100k; there‚Äôs likely some growth slowdown in Q3.
Ok Tesla can we get power 15 minutes?
I bought 2 shares of NVDA just to prove my influence over the market. Despair
After hours is when the real action happens
I willl end my No Nut November streak with no hesitation if NVDA finishes $300 EOD
MARA MARA on the wall.

Go green for fuck sake and stop playing with me
Charts and fundamentals on FB are stupidly bullish. 

Honestly looks like the best buying opportunity since QCOM at 123. 

MU potentially also but MU scares me. I remember the fall of Marty Moho.
I believed her when she kept saying, "I'm not like other girls"

But I never expected it to mean every time she cums, she squirts diarrhea
So you're saying she gives you the shits?
No, he gives her the shits
Shit‚Äôs hot
Ban bet NVDA 240 tomorrow
Fuck I meant 340
welp my NVDA calls just crapped the bed...
Sorry buddy. I thought buying after a 15% rally was the good move too.
What you buying bruh
Musk is now like *"deal secured"*. Next is *"split secured"*, obviously.
Brace yourselves for more gaping üåàbers üöÄüöÄüöÄ
AMC and GME have Green Day‚Äôs right? Today? Right? Guys?
Hope NVDA bears cashed in on that dip. From here on out, it‚Äôs up
I for one did.
Still have some lottos though
NVDA will take years off of my life if it crashes
If your not in tsla calls you don‚Äôt belong here
Sad I sold mine yesterday afternoon now, but that dip scared me. Wish I would have been busy and missed it
TSLA is an emotional rollercoaster

Already did at a 36 average. Selling deep itm covered calls so i can leave my position and split into rivian when they IPO
Loaded and loading moar!!!
Looks good today.
Bears in shambles
You can‚Äôt tell me tsla doesn‚Äôt at least tap 1300 today with the stupid momentum it has.
TSLA just took a massive shit
makes me wanna vomit im down like 5.5k
Rebounding now, sell man becareful and stop gambling you people worry me
as soon as it touches breakeven im selling, fucking got to 8k down i was gonna die
When tf did u buy and for how much bro be careful not greedy
all good man i am now up 2k for the day and closed out of all positions, it was pure greed driven but i got super fuckin lucky and this market is on hulk mode
I‚Äôve taken some major loses myself and I don‚Äôt wanna deal with that ever again the dress was physically and mentally killing me
same, last year i lost i think 11k in total and basically felt like a piece of shit for months, this year i've managed to reverse all of that and now im up 5k lifetime. but the wins make me greedy, i really need to cool it but earnings season is so hard to ignore.
We've really come to the point where a 1200 stock dropping 10 dollars is a mASsivE shIt!
It‚Äôs a massive shit on my calls
BtD
BUY THE DIP $TSLA
OMG is this take off for GME?

EDIT: Damn jinxed it.
GME makes fresh tendies every half hour
SPY calls are free money!
I find it funny when Tesla bulls call it manipulation when the stock doesn‚Äôt go up lol
Stock too undervalued imo
It‚Äôs a meme stock.  That‚Äôs what they do
lol thats crazy. TSLA should be back at 1000 right now. Its being manipulated up. Its the only thing thats held up the indexes over the last week or two. Its been off its EMAs for decades. The chart is laughable.
But who‚Äôs actually buying NVDA at $300?
Currently up 500% on an NVDA 305 call expiring 11/12... whats the move? Roll it out? Get a higher strike?

EDIT: Sold for +569%.
Sell it
profit, wait for short term drop then buy back in
Sell it holy shit
I'm up 1500% and 2300% think there's more room....
Anyone going back to work tomorrow is a gay bear that got wiped in the market.

F showing it‚Äôs horsepower strength.  This thing on a tear for past month. Relentless and showing no signs of slowing down. Plus Rivian IPO which Ford has a controlling interest should add to this momentum.

I‚Äôve mostly just been playing the initial dips on fomc for the year but feel like we‚Äôre getting to a point where we can‚Äôt kick the can much longer tbh. Plays aren‚Äôt gonna be betting against them but don‚Äôt wanna go in empty handed if I‚Äôm ever wrong with SPY having a negative earnings yield.
This is the start of a bull run, play the momentum. When the music stops it will wipe out 20% gains, so make money while you can.
463s from yesterday were print city, had some GME 230c weeklies I picked up those absolutely ripped. Playing RKLB a lot rn for the satellite launch this month you should check it out their tech is amazing.
I stick to SPY weeklies usually, buy on Monday OTM like 50 contracts and unload to pay for premium. 

I like to follow one ticker, to retarded for anything else.

I haven't heard as much about a market collapse lately...looks like blue sky and smooth sailing ahead.
Nah they reported it on the news, OPEC+ refused the increase of pump.
This is worrisome to me
All the advisors I know predict imminent disaster. China will somehow be the linch pin, just a hunch. I‚Äôm ready to buy the dip!
Imagine not being long NVDA and AMD for the past couple years, basically shooting yourself in the foot
Z going straight to hell, F the pump
i honestly think that pump was just some shorts taking profit

cmon tsla you want that 1240 just get it
The last few days there has been action (Either up or down) at about 11:30-12 EST and then action (Just up) again at 3:40-4 EST
yeah i made a buck from that EOD action yesterday, bought calls at the wrong time this morning so i'm just clowning hoping to see a bump while other people make money on smarter plays

it did just touch 1240 though so i could see today being good overall
yeah, i think EOD you will be good to go.

Been holding this pos call that's red as a mf, might as well keep it in hopes.
I can't get over the fact that SPY has outperformed its annual growth rate in the last three weeks, alone.

I just lost some brain cells, thanks buddy
Hey man, I've seen dumber questions
Continuously. It's most evident on the day of exp where it'll tank during power hour if it's otm.
That question just cost you some Theta
Every. Second.
The whole duration of the option‚Äôs life. Including mid day & so on.
All the time. Even when market is closed
only when you look at your portfolio friend
Lmg, TSLA 11/5s going to hell?
Nah I don't fuck with Tesla, I have some spy 465 11/10s debating to cut them today or tomorrow
It‚Äôs 11/5s you‚Äôd have to worry about
throughout the day.  you'll feel it more the shorter the expiration.  Sometimes IV burn can be felt with very big fed news.  Prob hardly noticeable with 30 day exp.  Very noticeable with 0 dte.
Do I dare doubt the TSLA power hour climb
I bought partial Tesla shares for you Chad holders ‚úäüò§

Yeah I hate it when it's up 7% in three weeks. Like good lord, move.
I‚Äôm not talking about the last three weeks BRO

But yeah that‚Äôs exactly what I mean. It‚Äôs up a ridiculous amount and I‚Äôm holding calls and stressed about a pullback. If it‚Äôs gonna happen I just want it to happen NOW so I can stop waiting for it

"The regulon analyses indicated that the states of the peripheral immune system after vaccination had reduced type I interferon responses, indicative of attenuated general antiviral abilities at least 28 days after the first inoculation."

"Together, these data suggested that after vaccination, at least by day 28, other than generation of neutralizing antibodies, people‚Äôs immune systems, including those of lymphocytes and monocytes, were perhaps in a more vulnerable state."

Bought some NVDA spreads last Friday hoping for an easy 3 bagger in the run-up into earnings.  If I didn't sell the damn calls they would have been an easy 10 bagger

I decided to buy BABA puts not realizing earnings was today..
you good. stock ussual drop on good earnings.
IV crush will fuck me tho, no?
Tell that to the CAR folks
well, BABA did drop on earnings a few times the past 1-2 year, then it went up the following days, so your puts had a chance
i‚Äôm seeing 11/10 earnings
starting to seem like it, because the BABA news headlines don't mention earnings. eTrade and now Google had it wrong
Etrade said yesterday, everyone else says today and the Alibaba website says nothing at all. Not cool because I bought calls that expire tomorrow expecting an earnings release. Kinda shitty for a publicly traded company, even a Chinese company.
it's actually still a good time to own calls if you're in it for the earnings. the two-week run-up is sometimes sweeter than the actual earnings day movement
Keep eyes on Halo üëÄ
Rooting for root.  Just need a little pop before next Friday for come calls to print
Was thinking about buying shares before earnings? I‚Äôm not 100% tho but it looks like there could be value there around 5 dollars! I mean how much more will it drop?? I saw it pump a few times with very little volume increase

We‚Äôre PENN earnings released early? Shits tanking
Ahh dammit I could've gotten in on NRDS yesterday on webull. Missed another IPO.
Yoloed 45k into bird at opening and sold a few minutes later for 6k gain, course that was over 20k at the $35 touch, but oh well I‚Äôm high anxiety on that stuff.

 I might do the same with nrds, you‚Äôre not -supposed- to do that if you go early access.
God I wish I had 45k to do that with. 6k gains is still a fantastic return!! Most IPOs peak and then drop the same day. Allbirds was unique in that it almost stayed 2x its IPO price. 

Man I would be so happy with a 6k win in a day lol I don't think they restrict your selling if you're scraping IPOs..not that I know of anyways.
If you use the early entry through Robinhood they give like 3 warnings that you can be banned from future IPO for buying and not holding for 3 months.  I heard a lot did this in Hood IPO with no repercussions but I wouldn‚Äôt chance it and just scalp off the official opening,  problem is you have to watch for when it opens.

About the 45k I started with 4K in January and went and learned through the year on how to scalp and when to yolo huge into things. Allbird was against my code except they said here that Robinhood denied shares so I figured it could hurt for just a small period.
I thought the IPO lockup period was for founders, owners, managers, and employees.¬†Didn't know brokers enforce that on scalpers. I mean if you get in on the IPO the next day does that still count?

Wow 11x your initial is great. So happy for you!! Where did you scalp allbirds? Don't think there are many RH users on WSB anymore but would love to hear about the trading code you follow. Always appreciate different perspective from others.
im up to nearly 70k now....  i just left my profile open with allbirds on top of my listings and bought as soon as the price changed from $15 to slightly over 21.  This is rough to do though cause you kinda have to eagle eye it cause IPO seem to have a like 3 hour window and randomly open in it.  I got in at 22 flat and was immediately ready to sell just in case.  it went up a bit and took a downward and i was out.   


I'll see if i can screenshot RH IPO warning but its like a thing they specifically do because the lockup is for people that get in even before RH allows buy ins and i think those are legally enforced.    


I assume RH bans the quick sellers under contract for them being allowed to let you into something before market.  Scalping IPO pricing into open would be really bad and i think overall lose the companies that initial cash flow boost.  


My code isnt really much just sell straight lines up within 10 minutes MAX  (SPY this morning)  I dont care it went another dollar and id have walked with double I took over 2 months pay with-in 15 minutes of open.  
Avoid IPO that dont have hype surrounding them, birds i heard about last week and looked into them, shoe looks neat, cheap to produce (long term could be the next crocs), the ipo day there was an article about it being the most anticipated IPO of the week.  
ANYTHING outside of big named companies, ive learned to avoid Clov, Prog, any of the ones that come out of nowhere and get hyped for nearly no reason or stuff that supposed to be waiting for some approval for something.  


Sorry it was a long one...![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)

Oh what I meant was you had to get your (pre)order in by yesterday (on webull) for them to process it today.

How long you guys think bull market continues? Well into 2022?
Spy is animalistic
Full on Beast Mode
Wow, my Nov 12th credit spread just closed a week early.  Thank you Mr Powell and SPY and USA.
SENS about to break $4 grabbed the 4 calls .4 and 4.5 for .25
[deleted]
the most retarded market i have ever seen.. tendies everywhere
Except anything that makes sense  
Dog money clone -> 40 B  
Prints fucking METAL - > Eh
fukin nutz
NVDA calls were the play today but since losing all my money in GME I could only afford 1
Ocgn $11 calls looking like the play rn
Taking profits are good but I dont feel good selling my NVDA 11/26 285C at 3.20 a few days ago.
Damn sold my AMZN call today way too early
I keep rolling into higher calls
Spy 11/19 470c check out the interest and volume
Holy shit! Is NVDA really doing that?
SPY $1000 wen
GME IS ANGRY
NVDA running today ?
Just come to terms that we're probably not getting a decent pullback to buy in and grab something 1-3 months out to be safe
Palantir has Q3 ER on Tuesday. Palantir will beat ER. Palantir is the Future. Buy calls on Palantir. Palantir will make you rich. Palantir
Y‚Äôall were saying that a year ago smh
look at the one week chart, read fundamental numbers from Q2 ER, look at contracts entered into by Palantir since Q2
if Fb would stop being a little bitch and just go up that would be great.
Paperhanded the living fuck outta my NVDA calls and wanna be sick
mfs were really out here yesterday buying puts on nkla
Sold a little early. That's okay, as long as I'm making money.
Haven‚Äôt seen AMZN move like this in awhile
I‚Äôm beginning to think YOLOing everything into TQQQ is the real move.
Was SAVA really halted since open? Didn‚Äôt even get a chance to buy calls
> Nah, it was halted for a few minutes because of some glitch.
Dkng bout to get paid
omg NVDA calm the fuck downnn lol
Imagine JPOW is the new President. Imagine all the money getting printed üöÄ
Bring on the fucking bull run fucking yolo everyday fuck it fuck this fuck that I‚Äôm sick of losing money.
TDOC is the new TSLA üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
yeah babyyyyyy
NKLA setting up nice for a game sqz??![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)
Would be really nice if TSLA would stop acting so üåà
Sir Jack going to hit 10 million with this Big 5 play isn‚Äôt he? Fucking amazing
> Yes, he is.
How do you follow him? Or anyone.
Sell my 465 calls I bought yesterday now or wait till close? My average is 1.27
I'm taking profits at every chance right now
Money Market stop hitting the pause button  on SAVA
SAVA killing it!
SAVA up 50% why?
SAVA going to be open for like 1 hour today at this rate.
There‚Äôs goes SAVA with my retirement again üôÑ CAR and SAVA were your fuck this moves and I missed em
One would think SAVA cured cancer or some shit but it's just them reporting no evidence of Data manipulation in a 2012 article..... how does that deserve a news halt
So you didn't buy?
Nvda calls for earnings was the move. Its ripped for like weeks straight
Hi, should I buy puts now ? üòÇüòÇüòÇ VisualMod is not gay
If i don't look the stock will go up. Just never look at it
Jeez. Scared to buy puts on NVDA
Yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt. No telling if that thing just retards up to 300 or not.
Lift off anytime SOFI
I wish I held my sava 70 c for next week. But glad I still have some 60c
Enjoy Santa claus rally folks üöÄ
GO TSLA GO
HULK COCKET ON TSLA
Cashed out on my Amazon weekly lotto for 300% gains
NIO ‚Äòbout to üöÄ
I sold my NVDA calls Monday at $257 when they dipped RIPPPPPP
MVST makin a run today
My TSLA puts are starting get more expensive.
IV spike. Sell em now before they become totally worthless.
Heck no. Im riding this thing back to 1000. The chart for TSLA looks crazy right now. Im playing puts on it as well. Took 50% on it this morning.
It‚Äôs not going to go back to 1000 anytime soon bro. Elon could announce a stock split and it would be at 1600 in a few weeks, and there‚Äôs precedent that he would probably split it again.
I have puts all the way out to next May. Im patient and can wait. Not doing dailies or weeklies. Elon can do what he wants to do. The EMAs have to eventually be hit. 20EMA is still at 1000 lol. These charts are a joke right now for all of these stocks.
They don‚Äôt. TSLA has defied TA for the last year and a half.
Bought the PENN dip along with my DKNG calls. I‚Äôm either an idiot or a secret genius
How tf does NKLA even have $125m to settle with the SEC? Lol
> They had to borrow it.
It's the fomo for me
Uber on that dip was beautiful
$F = Tendies
NET with big dick energy, the most overvalued stock in the market ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Spy has no interest in dipping it seems
Ditched my Zillow puts for less profit than I should‚Äôve had, it is officially in the slow crawl phase now
holy shit this is so X-rated
Miss three trades today. Microsoft was the easy short term trade.
WE GOING MELTY TO 470
Seriously who gave PayPal the Kramer kiss of death? Everything else I have is ripping except the one with an earnings report on Monday that's severely over sold.
That ytd chart. Guh
Makes zero sense.
I remember what being broke felt like
I think Nerdwallet might be a good entry at $19-20 to dump tomorrow
GOOG $3k would be the tits
MY DICK IS HARDER THAN A STEELIX RN THANKS NVDA LMFAO

Your flair says you aren't good with predictions
https://youtu.be/Ickn8iipxUc 

Me when someone says TSLA can‚Äôt pump anymore
I know nobody probably dabbles with SPYG, but the options are cheap and it has performed very well for me.
I need to one day look into how the different spy stuff perform versus each other
It's interesting. It fits my risk tolerance and budget perfectly and allows for moderate but consistent gains.
What call would you personally buy right now?
I mix it up between monthly calls, leaps, and outright share purchases. The shares for long term, the options  for short term plays.
> I would buy the call on AAPL.
F you bot im buying 10 of 12/17 $74c
$CRSP red to green ü§ùü§ùüß¨üß¨üöÄüöÄ
I‚Äôm new to options. Yesterday for 230 strike price their was 46,000 volume on gme calls expiring this Friday. Today at open their was zero volume. Does this mean they all sold their calls ?
Of course I have calls in the one company not going up lol fucken disney

I think it‚Äôs to sell z puts üò¢üòî
If nvda can go to 300. Rkt to high 30s. I‚Äôll probably won‚Äôt be in the red anymore! üòÄ
Every stock I have is green and insane right now. But my DKNG calls are failing me, come on donkey
Just doubled down. Feels like a triple bottom.

RIOT MY BOY
Mama su keeps fucking up my CC's
Cause you should be selling credit puts spreads dummy
I already hold a shit ton if shares, the cc's r a hedge against that. Credit put spreads would make me lose so much if it dropped a bit
$F up 3% today on less than half its normal volume. Likes to jump at the end of the day.

Amazon you big bitch
NVDA gonna keep zooming till earnings
Just bounced out of my NVDA calls
VIX bouncing back above 15 potentially
Z.  52-week range: $63 - $208.  They just got rid of their shitty business so now it's their core biz. What's not to love on this dip? Hmm?
Ford leaps hauling all my bags into the green.
I was going to buy puts, good thing I smoked and forgot
So, I have these ABNB calls that are up 80% 

https://imgur.com/a/slgDiBP

I‚Äôm not sure what to do, recently I‚Äôve held calls that were once up 50%+  and are now down 85%+, and now I‚Äôm not sure what to do, thoughts?
If you have to ask, sell
Screenshot, sell
11/12 467c‚Äôs I bought at open up almost 50%. Made back about 1/4 of what I lost yesterday on puts. Wish I‚Äôd gone in with more than just a couple contracts this morning but I was shell shocked from yesterday. Still, fucking nice to claw my way a little bit back out of the hole
I did the same exact thing.  QQQ calls up 50% too
Tell nvda to go to 300 thanks
Spy puts and Ba calls. Why do I hate money
Tf happening to NKLA? Anyways time for some 11$ puts
Cmon tsla do something
Moderna injecting me with red ü•≤
I went full wsb degen and bought BB when it was first running up and having bag holding since. It's recovered a bit but I'm still down a good portion. Should I sell it now and put it all in spy and companies like AAPL or just keep holding. I'm thinkin about the opportunity cost for holding onto BB for years until it recovers. I would be losing about 30 -40 percent on initial investment.
Could hold during this potential meme rally just in case. I would've dumped by now but whats another few weeks in case the apes keep it up I guess
Anyone buying square calls? I'm guessing they will crush earnings from making so much mega bucks off of crypto. 

I'm betting the same for paypal who's dip I keep on buying, though albiet it's shares. Up to 160 shares now. Lol.
Bought 14k worth of shares in my 401k.  Can‚Äôt do options there so I‚Äôll ride through earnings and hope they can get to 300 soon.

Awfully glad I didn't paperhand my pipsqueak NVDA call yesterday. 10x today.
Whos going to be the next trillion dollar company?
nvda and it's not even close.
NET
They dont even have $1B in revenue and you think they're going to be the next $Trillion company?
Same thing was said of tesla
fuck you moderna
Make AMZN Great Again
Anybody else balls deep in PLTR calls or is it just me
Without looking I'm gonna guess it's between $23 and $28, how close am I?
well it went from 24 - 26.50 currently but yes you nailed it lol. ER on Tuesday tho
Fucking PLTR lol, never change
No calls but bagholding cost basis $28.60 shares.
Oops, my BB calls gonna be OTM

Disney is single handily killing my boner this week. Maybe it‚Äôs better just settle for break even again and try earnings next week.
do I close nio as I break even?
Guh. Thought FSLY would fly on earnings. Why did I buy LEAPs
Already up to $19, Hallelujah, praise the maker of the model-T!
It‚Äôs on 10:30 Jesus
FSLY didn‚Äôt do it‚Äôs usual dump on earnings, but the sell off is happening already. Check the chart for historical price action after earnings.
That's because this was a positive earnings report for once. Yeah they kinda sandbagged with shitty expectations but the stock has taken enough of a beating over the last year
The largest caps have just been blazing it up ever since the March covid crash, holy shit. Why even buy any other stonk lmao.
i think a lot of ppl are realizing that now. why guess when you can buy something you KNOW is going to go up?
Shit man AMD calls too?

Damnit I don‚Äôt even want to look
People must have caught on to Keith Rabois‚Äô tweets. The guy said multiple times that OPEN was going to crush earnings next week lmao
Really should have seen Nvidia pumping with qcom. Fuuuuuuuuck
Is Visa dead
PENN bleeding out, my sports gambling portfolio in shambles
what the fuck is happening, their earnings were great
Honestly it wasn't that great, increased revenue but a drastic decrease in margins
Not complaining,  because SPY is doing me right,  but Msft at 330 earlier would've been a hell of a buy.

I actually bought XLY off the back of that DD. 195c and 205c for Jan 22. Still holding and very happy.
Haha I'm jealous. I got spooked by the Evergrande thing and didn't bother. Enjoy your cash man.

They overpaid for shit houses in overpriced areas.

SHARWS
I don't know that I would put $64,680 into it, but I believe it to be fairly safe at the current price. I have 1,300 shares at $20.36, I'm not looking to hold onto them for long, hoping to sell most or all for \~$25 in the relatively near term.

Earnings in four days, but I'm not sure that matters. I think SPCE is a pre-revenue/future growth play, as the kids say.

$NRDS going to the moon!!
I tried telling yall about nerdwallet smh
Sold my suncor, sneaky 12% profit and going all in on PLTR for earnings next week...
Halts seem to be more common, you can always predict it.
When job report
Nerd Wallet halted again on RobinHood because of the insane buying! $NRDS
NVDA runnnnnnnnnin
Nerd to $100
Is NRDS a long term play or should I take my profits and run later in the day
Run
Too many competitors, it'll be drowned out. Fintech has left the building. Nerdwallet is known for a message board and used to be known to check lowest rates on loans. 

It didn't evolve and innovate enough while it had a head start in the fintech world. I was like 15 years old and browsed their forums for financial advice. Other players, such as SOFI, did.
Today is such a great day! COST, NVDA, and NRDS are all super green today.
COST is beast stock in gen, it moving is pretty insane. i worked there for about 3 years, and the stock itself had so many special divis of like $10 dollars per share
everything green besides my disney calls.. why couldnt i just be a retarded tech bull :,(
I just loaded up on 11/19 180s on the cheap fingers crossed on the mouse
Anyone else buying TGT calls for earnings run up?
Thoughts on Nerd top?
Imo top.  But im a retard.
Reminds me of hood ipo
NFLX going down a decent amount. calls for a rebound?
imo NFLX Entry is at $655, next entry after that is $632 ish
gotta love how only a handful of companies keep pushing the market while everything else bleeds
Anyone else considering 11/12 466c?
ugh, if only i went with nvidia over spy. goddman. it won't stop.
Anyone have thoughts on DKNG earnings tomorrow? I started building a position today
I think they will be good. Sports recovery versus last year still a thing. Still expanding into new markets. The growth will be there. No clue on profitability. 

Anyway, the way this market has been going they could kill it and still dump. My reason for getting calls is it has been beaten up and hasn‚Äôt run up over the last few weeks like everything else. I got longer dated strikes just in case it dumps though.
I have a similar mindset. People are looking for stuff that‚Äôs still cheap and if DKNG beats expectations and improves guidance I think we have a good run ahead
The NBA partnership announced today heading into a fresh NBA season could definitely lift guidance
have mostly 50c lined up for next few weeks, bought a few lower strikes on todays dips.  I think my 50c for this friday are pretty toast, was hoping for a runup, but i think next few weeks will pick up to 52-55 range
Lots of competition on the sports betting app market. MGM, Caesars, and others.
$PENN big opportunity
Is it though?  Price is about where it dipped to a few months ago when their outlook was much better.
Damn I missed the oil dip.

Any particular reason why NVDA is up over 10% today?
No, it had a price upgrade but this shit is wild. I own some nvda but this is fucked
it's got some bullish news behind it, and earnings are coming up. Plus ppl want to buy something that's going up.
Its been a couple months since the stock split.
Wells Fargo maintained an Overweight rating on the stock and raised its price target from $245 to $320.

How is MRNA not an easy BTD?
I apologize to everyone in NKLA, in typical fashion, I bought call options when it was up 13.5% which is why it stopped there
Bought nvda 5 320 for next week, sold 4 to completely cover cost and let the last ride since it'll hit that tomorrow.
Any good calls I could hop on right now? Got 60$ to throw into something
1 Amazon call

What actually constitutes a halt? If the investors think it‚Äôs worth hundreds of dollars and it ipos at $18 why should it be stopped? I‚Äôm not in NRDS but I can see the frustration with that. What is the sec‚Äôs interest in stopping a successful IPO?
It‚Äôs a certain % threshold of movement in x amount of time
> The stock market is a zero sum game. The only way to win is not to play with your money
So trading halts really aren't about feelings or your thoughts.  The market exists to facilitate trades.  Each trade has a buy side and a sell side, and broadly, each market in a stock has a group of buy-siders and a group of sell-siders.

Ordinarily the market works very efficiently to match these people up - and bear in mind that's not magic.  That matching process is work and some person or some machine has to do that work.

When the buy siders and sell siders get so out of sync with each other that matching isn't occurring efficiently - and especially when spreads are so wide that traders who step up to the queue microseconds apart are being handed 10% or more differences in their execution prices - the market may call a halt and cancel some orders to let everyone get back into sync.  It takes time for buy siders and sell siders to intellectually process price action and this is one of the important things for a market to price efficiently, that market participants have time to digest the information they're getting about price fluctuations.
Its a circuit breaker like vacaluv said. It prevents panic buying/selling, its automatic.
I can get that but arguably I feel like halts scare people into selling as soon as it become unhalted.
If you saw one of your stocks drop 20% in 5 min you‚Äôd probably just insta-sell without having time to actually figure out what was happening. Thats panic selling. The breaker at least gives you 10 min to figure shit out and make an educated decision.
Why they sell BNTX for taking MRNA‚Äôs business 

Idiots
I feel too good about all my calls gonna hedge by adding some 11/10 660 puts. The rich do not want me/us to make money (a huge fact I've realized since starting options over a year ago). So actually going to hedge myself

IS THIS GROWTH? AM I MATURING?
No.

Also, we don't care if you make money or not.
Oh, sassy. is someone having a bad day?

> Call options are a derivative security that allows the owner to buy IBM1 stock at $120 per share until February 22, 2019. The call option will be worth nothing if you don't exercise it before its expiration date or if IBM1 is trading below $120 when the contract expires.

I have never bought options but I wanna start. I was thinking PTON, PINS, or UBER calls for earnings... any suggestions?
I would not buy options for earnings for your first option
or ever really.
Pton and pins puts not calls
Do not
Earnings options is *almost* always bad. IV goes up before hand because earnings can cause volatile moves and you can get IV crushed if the movements are small off earnings and they usually are always small unless a company misses or crushes earnings way more than expected
I would go UBER since Lyft destroyed earnings, also Uber pre announced they might turn a profit this quarter, and think about what seasons next, holiday season, travel season, Uber everywhereeee, they‚Äôre gonna raise guidance
I‚Äôm gonna go for a $47 call that expires tomorrow. Figured I can‚Äôt learn options until I try and Lyfts earning will be a sign of what Uber will show.
Neither. Volatility collapse
CLNE earnings gonna do anything?
up or down a lot

PENN isn't a bad company, every gambling company has to do PR with a bunch of retards.  Real gamblers - the ones who keep Wall Street and the Strip in business - are perverts with a death wish.

It's a shame ban bets are one-sided.  Why bet when there are no stakes for winning, only losing?

Apes, you're not gonna believe this. AMZN is not splitting because it can exploit its round down RSU vesting and underpay up to $3k to its employees every year. For $100k RSU vesting at 5% in the first year, you get 5k worth of stocks i.e. 1.5 stocks that gets rounded down to 1 stock. The remaining is moved to the end of the 4th year. Splitting the stock would take away this advantage from them. Sourced.

It is. 2023 and 2024 will print HARD. 300 will be a major support like 200 is today by 2022
Z keep going down you can do ittt
Surely the euphoria has to slow down at some point
nope.. where else are people going to put their worthless cash?
Sure. But. Today is not that day.

Thank you Lisa su Bae‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
ROKU, PYPL, and NFLX calls look so tempting
Tell me a good strike/date on BroKu, options are pricey.  I might jump back up to $320 quick though i imagine once selloff is over
I bought 11/19 $300
[deleted]
This sub is too stupid to understand you can play both sides. It‚Äôs binary for them
CROX doing better than most tech companies. Time for Nasdaq to add CROX to their holdings. I assume they use tech to make their shoes super comfortable so that counts.
CROX is a technology company, not a car company. CROX is the next TSLA.
Imagine being ROKU $450 holder?
I need SQ to stay in between $245 and $260 by eod tmrw
Better pray for a good earnings call buddy. I think you have a better chance of success than not though.

Sell RKT before earning today or hold? Been holding bags for a while and this could be the best price to sell for a bit.
Between dkng and rkt, i chose to hold rkt over night
Lol same here!! I sold off my dkng puts for little money today and lost money on calls though
> Sell RKT before earning today.
Sell that MF

I wish you all could see the future that I see

To be fair, it‚Äôs kind of shitty, but it‚Äôs going to print

Holding DDOG and SQ leaps through earnings. Pray for me.
SQ has been tumbling each day with earnings today AH.  Do you guys know something I dont?  SQ has historically done well on earnings, and with their savings account (BTC) at ATH, I figured that would look good as well.

How does a company make no revenue, announce further stock dilution, and the stock jumps 20%
What will $AMD price by end of year?? Tons of potential in the cpu and gpu business for this one.
I hear ya. I Just bought 500 shares today at 132 for the long.  Also buying Ford for long
Ford is a great long term hold. I missed out last year when it was like $4-5. I was really close to buying it at that price but got spooked from the whole covid thing.
Also since you're an AMD holder now, I'd recommend joining r/amd_stock for the latest news on AMD :)
I can already feel the sour hour coming today.
wow amzn is really oging to 3500
Just bought calls that were already up almost 2k% lol
The earnings I‚Äôm playing today: sunrun(puts), peloton(puts), pins(puts), Shake Shack(calls), uber(puts), square(puts)

Thoughts on PTON earnings? I think they‚Äôre gonna shit the bed hard
Short it
Market saturation, over-priced, hype is starting to die out. Subscriptions are great until they aren't. They need to start a collaboration with OnlyFans if they really want to drive user 'growth'.
PINS Dec 17C i think are solid. if earnings work in out favor. If you get calls hedge IMO

Give me a fukin play
Ford calls.
SAVA 100c 11/19. IV is terrible but they will print
Finally DKNG caught a bid
Might take my nvidia profits and buy more calls for earnings on a dip and then the rest on penn calls for next year
NIO gearing up for EOD run. Get in ü§´
We will run well past NIO day, nothing is anywhere near priced in yet.
My leaps need this
Why would I not buy a NET put ?!? There is no way earnings can match the expectation, right ?
Why not? Because the 11/5 190P has 270% IV. If you don't know what that means, just save your money and don't buy it.
I started loading puts when they were at 192. Averaged down 2x. Thought about bailing. Gonna go with it tho
Probably better to buy tomorrow if it spikes big after earnings.  Might be profit takers then.

It just seems like it has an insane amount of nonsensical buying behind it at these valuations.

Just not worth playing with puts pre-earnings even though it's impossible for earnings to beat expectations for them.
PTON gonna shit the bed fasho
Bought some puts but maybe too otm. 75p
Expiry? And when did you buy them?
Lol what? I bought em today for Friday. There is no other plays
I bought them today too but expiry for next Friday

Because nothing makes sense in this market
Some kind of conference is happening and there‚Äôs speculation about some kind of ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù tech (like Zucks new thing) which may be extremely profitable and an analyst upgraded their PT to $320
FB/Meta announced it's beefing up its servers and data is the best I can find...ER 17 Nov, early even for that run-up. And haven't heard as much about sold-out GPUs as last time round. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|table_flip)

2nd post in a row on this, sorry, but excited. ME is up 3.65% today alone. There is 20% of shares shorted and a ~26% borrow fee. In 2 weeks, Nov, the 2 highest strikes are $12.50 and $15 (with lots of calls). There‚Äôs some potential here I think. I just picked up 500 shares

Why chwy  moon?
So is the federal reserve just buying stocks with fake money? Is that why they just go up?? I‚Äôm confused wtf is quantitative easing.
Quantitative easing is a fancy way to say that the Fed is buying shit off the open market. 

Normally they try to stimulate the economy through lowering interest rates, but that stops working once interest rates near zero, it's like pushing on a string. So to juice the economy even more, they hold interest rates at zero + buy shit.

Right now the Fed is buying T-bills plus mortgages, so not stocks directly, but their zero interest policy is juicing the market indirectly. The bond market is ded'er than bears right now because the Fed suppresses them so low, so bond money is pumping into stocks and juicing them. 

Zero interest also means that companies can buy back their own shares by borrowing free debt and pump their own stock. The doombears at Zerohedge shared a study showing without share buybacks (which rarely happen in a normal interest rate environment), SPY would be at $280. 40% of the market growth since 2010 has just been cheap debt fueled buybacks.

People freak the fuck out over QE ending because if QE ends, then zero interest might end too. Buybacks would stop and stock money would rotate back into bonds. IOW, the market would take an absolute shit and stay down afterwards.
Bears can you please take FB down to 315 again so I can get leaps please and thank you? I need more FB leaps to go with my QCOM leaps for the grand autist metaverse meeting/stock rally.

Like I get earnings right. Oh got calls because I identify big growth? Stock tanks. Etc
Loool nvda straight to Mars
oops i held nvda calls too long looks like, fuck my life lol
Lol
So the flavour of the day is NVDA, if you're asking it's too late to get in it probably is. There are other plays out there, DBX, CLNE, DKNG, and GoPro consider getting something that isn't up 10000% on its options

Ok, so I think Marqeta is getting bought out soon. They had 72 jobs on indeed recently and now on their LinkedIn only have 6. And half of them are "M&A Associate counsel " and paralegals. And they are shaking out shareholders as we speak. And someone bought 55K worth of way way way out of the money calls expiring next month.
Bagholder spotted.

NVDA with a PE ratio over 11x that of INTC and over 2.5x that of AMD...no way that sustains.
Now do tesla
Lol as if PE ratios matter at all nowadays
Actually NVDA with PE ratio 11x INTC sounds about right...2.5x AMD doesn't sound too far-fetched, will need to sort the shortage out for that.  "NVDA to open own fabs."? MOON,
Fucked up on NVDA twice today. Had $300 weeklies at $1.80 put a stop at $1.50 and it hit. Now it‚Äôs at $8 üò≠ then bought more $310 and sold for 20% profit. Just bought more $825 for 11/12 and I‚Äôm HOLDING

Last time you‚Äôre seeing NVDA under 300
Guys I originally bought NVDA i 2016 for 5 dollar per share. it is up 5000% in 5 years. What the fuck is wrong with this market. Why is a semiconductor company at such a huge multiple. 

I know the Fed is printing 120B per month for 18 months. so they have literally created 18\*120 = 2.1 TRILLION dollars that banks have leveraged into the markets.. When interest rates rise and this money moves it's going to be the greatest stock collapse in human history
Another bear trying to time the top go to sleep
AI will shape our future, and for now NVDA is the leader in hardware for machine learning.
Ehm, no. NVDA has increased revenue dramatically since then and will continue to do so. A bit on the overvalued side of the scale, but miles away from what would be a bubble. Think how much money there was in the cloud business in 2016 vs today.
Your brain is not able to understand what exponential growth is. Moreover, you seem to lack imagination. Perhaps you are also very young and have not experienced how the world has changed in the last 10 years alone. Finally, you seem to be uninformed. A large part of NVIDIAs growth comes from their progress in AI.
ü§°ü§°ü§°
Besides from the obvious importance of semiconductors its also been prioritized as a national security asset all around the world.

The BBBY runup basically confirmed the "meme" stock basket/shorting via ETF DD. No other reasonable explanation why GME and the others would spike that hard. Hedgies are still majorly fucked <3
Tapering is a start, but the Feds job is to be non-partisan and control inflation. It‚Äôs time they take the next steps and significantly raise the interest rates. If they would have done it earlier like they should have the ports wouldn‚Äôt have had this issue.
Ports are a supply and demand issue. Nobody in America makes anything, and nobody has a job, but we all have money to buy chinese stuff. 

you're right about interest rates though they should have been raised a long time ago. there was no real need for them this low. It started with Obummer, continued with Trumpholio, and is continuing with Kumaluhh (Biden is not with us anymore)
I agree, I do think though that a large part of the supply/demand imbalance is because our Fed is still in an expansionary phase.
I can see Jpow now "oh shit some dude on reddit thinks we should have raised interest rates.....did I fuck up?"
Wot
So calls or puts????
Yes
Honest question how does raising rates change the complexity/speed of hiring and firing around vaccine mandates at ports or help fill in for people who fall ill? Seriously just don‚Äôt know how rates would have a tangible effect on port traffic.
What smooth brained take is this?  Interest rates have nothing at all to do with the disaster of a system the ports run on or if the unions are willing to run 24/7 or if they have enough truck drivers. 

The government is levered to the tits, raising interest rates would be catastrophic.  Inflating away the wealth of dumbass bond holders is far preferable.

With Intel building new factories in Arizona I feel like they‚Äôre a great buy at this price. May take a few years but they‚Äôll get their shit together.
Intel is a decent dividend stock with a float of 4.1B vs Nvidia's tiny dividend and 2.5B in shares. Also NVDA is changing their business model aggressively to plan for the future. Intel is not. Not saying INTC is a bad stock to hold, but don't expect it to moon like NVDA is and does.

Playing both works in a volatile market, we had a pull back in sept. Vix is dead, no more volatility; especially now that taper is off menu.

Moonshot up towards EoY then maybe another small pullback, but at that time its peak euphoria so it will be unexpected
The market is extremely logical.

Inflation is due to high liquidity and cash and ‚Äúnothing was addressed‚Äù = we‚Äôre remaining in this position for the foreseeable future meaning institutions are putting the money back into the market for now

That earnings call was so bullish.
I really love how SPY insta bounces when it's RSI gets low but will continue to peg timeline after timeline over 70 for literally weeks on end ü•≤

If you bought SPY 12/31 $495c any of the times I recommended them, you've at least doubled your money now and counting

Why does anyone buy anything other than NVDA?
I ask myself this every time NVDA runs lol

How are you red?
Because there‚Äôs, like, a whole bunch of stocks out there and the ones I‚Äôm invested in are having a bad day I guess.
Answer is always Tesla.
It wasn‚Äôt for like six months lol good job to everyone in on that, I got shares but have stayed away from options.
Rumors 10 to 1 split next year
That would be great for me anyways,  I can always use more shares lol.
Until now NVAX PUTS PRINTING BRRRRRR
Zooms out and looks at graph, that's pretty damn volatile haha

To sell SQ or to not sell SQ
You held this far.
SPY why are you gay!
Wtf is going on with nvidia
Up 45% on TSM calls so far. Only semi play that hasn't run up a ton or been kicked down for good reason (looking at you, INTC). After the massive QCOM beat and the seeming settling of China/US tensions, I think TSM will be the next one to have a big run up
INTC has been kicked down rightfully.
Yeah that's what I was trying to say. Boomer company. Next IBM
TMC blood pressure now like 70/30 up from 60/dead

Thoughts on buying Rivian next week when it IPOs??
IPOs are always a gamble. I sell into any pops.
Yeathirrrrrr
> The Rivian R1 is a battery-electric, 2+2 sports utility vehicle (SUV) that seats up to five people. It has three rows of seating and can accommodate two children in the third row. The car will be available with four different drivetrains: rear wheel drive, all wheel drive (AWD), front wheel drive (FWD), or permanent 4√ó4 system for off road use only..
So much room for TSM to go up. It‚Äòa high was 140 in February. Think of all the money pumped into market since then and increasing semi shortage. 

Only reason it has been held down is China tensions, which are easing
PUSH IT TO THE LIMIT AHHHH
Fuck tesla and musk pussy. I am making nvda 3T dollar company

Taking gambling advice from a pRonstar?
Is an old WSB foe worth taking a chance on before earnings--  $CLNE???
> CLNE is a stock that has been beaten down by the market. It's currently trading at $3, which is significantly lower than its 52-week high of $14. The company just announced it will be releasing earnings on August 1st and I'm expecting to see some good news from them because they have been doing well in their business operations lately. However, since this stock was once considered very promising but then fell out of favor with investors due to an FDA warning letter in 2016, there are still many risks associated with owning CLNE shares right now...
Is this an outdated message?
It's from the future.

why does the remindeme bot have an ape flair?
I think a lot of new users in wsb get an auto ape flair. I had to hide mine using the sidebar
GME to 300?
Banbet it or shut the fuck up cuck
3,000
I‚Äôm a gay bear, but this shit is a bubble isn‚Äôt it?
Go hibernate loser
So wait for it to pop?
no one knows. they been saying that for the past 10 years and it keeps going up
I wasn‚Äôt. I was buying stocks these last couple years
Yes
It's called a blow off top, and it will end as spectacularly as it started.
I have been thinking that for awhile but I have been wrong for months
Def a bubble but tell me day before i can sell my shit and get some puts
I can‚Äôt tell when this pops
We've been in a "bubble" for a decade, but keep betting against the market.
I‚Äôm not betting against. I made a million last year and only like 190K this year
Some parts of the market definitely
You think that‚Äôs what this is?
Cmon GME break that 220 wall ü¶çüöÄ
Huge wall and it's really annoying.
Eyyy look at that, we just had to complain about it and a couple minutes later it broke through. Lol
This fucking administration‚Ä¶.

The vaccine mandate is a HUGE mistake; I don‚Äôt care about your opinion on vaccines.


I live in Alabama. We are a very proud people. People will quit their jobs. full stop. 

The labor market is already super tight. I cannot believe they are seriously moving forward with the mandate.
At a certain point people will need to eat and then the status quo will resume.
Or domestic terrorism ü§∑
domestic terrorism is just terrorism; it does not need a modifying prefix.  the capitol hill fiasco was full blown terrorism full stop; they should have been treated no differently than how we treated Osama and Saddam those watermelon merchants.
the need of workforce will outweight the need of food of the workforce
I doubt it.  These companies can bleed longer than you can starve.  My grandpa has seen this movie before.
I think it will affect the market greatly in the near future especially during Holiday Travel.  When reports come in of cancelled flights and people stuck at airports compounded with Fuel shortages, rental car shortage and winter weather.  Going to be wild.
I‚Äôm pro vaccine but I‚Äôm anti making people put things in their body.
Oh man, just think what will happen if people in Alabama start all quitting their jobs.  The country would grind to a halt!  It would be total chaos!  Where will we get out incest jokes from, without Alabama?
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky


It‚Äôs not just Alabama

It‚Äôs the entire fucking South. Do you know how many car plants are down here?
> I live in Alabama. We are a very proud people.

lmao what the fuck do you have to be proud of
I just live here. People here are very proud of their ‚Äúheritage.‚Äù And Meemaw Ivey


Alabama politics is famously fucking insane
I‚Äôm jacked to the tits thinking about Americans standing up and pushing back üá∫üá∏
Aw proud, stupid people
I mean you're from Alabama, so this autistic comment is on brand
Just like you don't care about opinions on vaccines, I don't give a shit about your awful opinion on mandates. No one cares if a bunch of inbred trash quit their job.
Inbred trash run this fucking country you piece of shit


Imagine hating the working class‚Ä¶
There are plenty of working class that aren't braindead hicks. I love blue collar people. I don't like anti science morons.
I think you SHOULD get the vaccine for the sake of personal and public safety, but giving companies the power to discriminate against employees based on health is a bad idea. They already have too much power over employees.

Got his ass
everyone in here is super bullish, so I'm thinking it's time for puts.
lol you're way too early.
depends on the time horizon.  buy 460's 45-60 days out and they will print. maybe not today or tomorrow, but id stake my life on the fact we are going below 460 in the next 2 months.
üòÇ Fucking Why
simple.  everyone here loses money.  so if the entire sub is talking about rockets and moons and calls, and they have a track record of losing money, then inversing is the play.
Do it then and I‚Äôll see you behind Wendys

What kind of question is that? Selling TSLA is forbidden. Daddy Elon says to buy more
Daddy ELON knows best ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
Do you want to do something rational, or do you want to circle jerk with the morons here?

Good ass day to buy TSLA puts
ü§°‚ò†Ô∏èü§°
I sold a little to lock in profit earlier this year. Just playing with house money now. This is a good exit point but I think I'll let it ride.
Goodbye spy
Gme is so last year, move on apes 

You're missing out on nvda
One day big money is gonna wake up and decide to dump Tesla, and it will be the greatest transfer of wealth from poor to rich in American history.
AMD and nvda are going to sell off then getting massive pump in AH for a sell off at open
Anyone going in on PENN?
I did with some jans
Yeah. I thought he was good in Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
DKNG
Do we like to gamble? Yes is the answer
People don‚Äôt buy good businesses at fair-ish value when oversold anymore.  Just whatever is at all time highs
50shares, 1 jan 65 call.
I want to believe in Dave, but I also know I don‚Äôt believe in Dave
Even without Dave its oversold get some Jan Calls or shares
Alright getting more $TSLA calls now

I sold too early 3 times this week and 2 times last week. I‚Äôll never learn.
Fuck JPow honestly stupid fuck thinks pumping this market nonstop is gonna fix anything when all he‚Äôs doing is making it more & more UNSTABLE
It gets pumped so high if the pani selling starts its gonna be a massacre
If you held NVDA I'm sorry
$GME, $BB and $CLF can‚Äôt go tits up.
CLF a good long term play, made 300% on calls post earnings
I‚Äôm shares only. Should have trimmed at $26+ now the bet is on infrastructure if those degenerates stop acting stupid.
Yea I sold my calls near $26 and noticed it drop, did the same with X on earnings sold near peak
X carried forward.... CLF on the other hand ..
J Pow just flawlessly pulled off the tapering announcement.
yeah, we know...

Legit free money glitch holding, idk why I was so retarded always trying to go short and get cucked on 0 dte
At this point I‚Äôm just going to keep buying spy calls 3 months out and rolling them further out when we get close.
Buy 50 x OTM weeklies monday, sell to cover premium hold for profits
Admittedly I'm a retard, which is why I'm here I guess. I've been buying and cashing in on SPY fairly regularly.. and I have no idea how much I'm going to have to pay in taxes. Am I screwing myself over by selling before a certain amount of profit?
No, you will pay gains regardless.
And taking gains is never fucking yourself. Just keep printing.
How effective is that I tried going like 2 weeks out and got cucked last time
3 months gives time for a dip to recover as long as you roll them out about a month before expiry. 2 weeks out is a lot more sensitive to any dip.

Edit: just try one and see how it goes
Yesterday around 2 would have been a good time to go 0dte
Yeah blew my account already so need to recoupe
Yah I saw that lol good luck
Uber calls free money if you want a play
More puts on zillow
Not yet.
I‚Äôm still holding mine from 3 days ago. This premarket is making me nervous tho I can‚Äôt lie
Good luck bro, you‚Äôve made money so locking profits is never a bad idea.
Thanks I agree but I don‚Äôt see how anyone invests in Z again in short term. I think it‚Äôs to 50 and I‚Äôve got diamond hands lol
Why?
Drops 30% in a week, the bad news is almost all priced in at this point.
Buy your puts at around 9:45
Fed: inflation isnt due to monetary policy

Also Fed: we‚Äôre going to back off our monetary policy due to high inflation

Look at AMD! 

So glad I bought more 15 mins ago, and more now at top
AMD is looking better for a run than NVDA atm. Not saying NVDA won‚Äôt go up but AMD just broke new ath more recently.
NVDA at ATH‚Äôs too tho I‚Äôm pretty sure, I own both, 20 shares NVDA 5 AMD
Yea i bought calls for both so let‚Äôs hope the tendie god comes through for us
Oh. My. God. Whoever you are, stranger, and where ever you are, I hope you have a great fucking day.
Thank you, you too homie! It‚Äôs a beautiful Green Day
I think people are predicting the acquisition to close in the next 10 days.
Is it a LCID day?
NVDA up another 6%.

Every thing is just a meme nowadays.
I mean NVDA is far from a meme stock
Sure is acting like one, price wise.
My account is finally in the green after investing in some kind of fake internet dog money and losing 36% of my capital. $595 went in on May 13, dropped to $377.01 by July 20, finally got into options and in a few days turned that $377 into $600+ currently. Hopefully I can get it into 4 digits by Christmas! 


This is a huge step for me because I recently had someone break into my work vehicle and steal my 3 big ass tool boxes that had most of my tools in them, plus insurance is giving me the run around, and  as a self-employed handyman that basically did it to me, I was finished. No more work. So trading options is my way of making as much as I can, remotely.
Email your state insurance commissioner to complain. Might not fix anything but worth a shot
Fuk you F. May your company burn down you fukin useless filth of a boomer garbage bastard fuk
on to the next one, let‚Äôs go.
Lol embrace it my friend. Get on the tendie train

Alright GME‚Ä¶ we just need‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. $140 more for me to fix my portfolio
don't miss the rocket ship autists and retards. diamond hands in GME only!! Let's fuckin ride yo
Looks like $SPY might go red today
Not worried until power hour, personally
TSLA retards legit think it‚Äôs impossible for the stock to go down rn
stonks go up only
Buy puts and shows us
Do you have evidence of the opposite?
As usual the GME DD cluttering the front page is wrong and GME isn‚Äôt doing shit.
You bears are crazy, will eventually run out of gas, spy will continue to hit gains day after day
GME chugging upwards with full force, 250$+ here we come!
Has anybody here refused to buy a stock you thought would be profitable because you disagree with what the company does or stands for? I've missed out on a few such opportunities, but I'm pretty sure I'm an idiot.
Trading on morality is a good way to go broke. Also, your investment will not change the company‚Äôs success, so just ride along with the whales.
My Morals don't Interfere with profit
I totally understand the sentiment but totally disagree. You could just as well think of it as taking profits away from some other trader who thinks the companies practises are morally acceptable. Wouldn't that justify the position? It's not like the underlying gets any profit from options trading, or even stocks apart from IPOs and issues.
Yes you are, every decision should be driven by making money
Fuck what the company does it‚Äôs all about the bars on the chart.
AMD and GME doing their things. Happy about that.

APPLE is my only disappointment, lets catch up already.
Please don't put AMD and GME in the same sentence.

Wtf.
lmaoo why not i own  both and plenty of them. 

Dont tell what to mention and not mention.b  i like money

> Something is lurking causing VIX to spike and the markets haven‚Äôt priced it in yet

Since VIX is a mathematical derivative of market price action, your statement is an oxymoron.
A mathematical derivative of the weighted prices of OTM puts and calls on SPX. Not share prices.
Smells of bear shit.
Probably because TSLA is so reasonably priced right now.
People locking in gains
Yeah something is lurking, I sold my SQQQ position and now the market is ready for the "Hah, you dumbass!!!!"

I bought NVDA during the march selloff at $470s. I sold at $525. AMA.
Are you running out of tears? You must be crying a lot
Not too bad. Had good plays since. I had to sell them as everything else was selling off and wanted to average down on other stuff. I might have even bought spy/qqq options for a quicker return.
Who keeps buying the $1300 calls?!?
People who aren‚Äôt scared of money
If you think NVDA is expensive remember that it is only trading at ~30x revenue whereas NET is trading at 100x revenue with half the growth rate üëç

Anyone else think we should ban inheritance to help gamify the economy? Recycle ‚ôªÔ∏è that money into the education system, free healthy meals for kids at school and try to level the playing field. One more step toward "all men are created equally", true meritocracy. If this were a board game, I think it would be an obvious improvement. Like Settlers of Catan vs Monopoly. Settlers has the robber to help keep the game going, some other dynamic features, Monopoly sucks as a game.

Think beyond self interest for a moment for the sake of discussion.
So, work my ass of to give my kids and family something and let a commie cuck dick licker have it for the sake of them not putting in work to have something? Fuck you
I‚Äôm a diehard Republican but even I hate how high the deduction is for the estate Tax. I don‚Äôt think we should ban it but def think the Govt should give a haircut to even pretty small inheritances. Trust fund babies are the worst. I think applying FICA taxes to income from trusts would help too.

All that is to say I‚Äôm supper bitter that I won‚Äôt be inheriting anything from anyone!
At least put a cap on it. Or a progressive tax on it.
I don't like to creep post histories but I had to know if you were serious. And I still can't tell. Congratulations on being a subtle troll or the most mild reddit monster on the site.
Being serious. üíØ Its a far fetch idea but if it were somehow feasible I wonder if the economy would benefit?
Idk I have seen the ways that a more capitalist approach keeps balance, I never really thought of the other way. I grew up where my family had to pick which utility to pay and which to get turned off. Now I pick which car I want to drive each day. No one gave me anything either but I learned to play by the current rules.
I'm with you, my story sounds pretty similar but i don't think these stories are as common as they could be. And would that make the pie bigger for everyone?
There might be an issue of how to liquidate businesses that would otherwise be inherited.

I've been warning you guys for some time now. Today, WHO said it as well. COVID is not dead and infections are on the rise in many countries. Germany is seeing record numbers of new infections and that's after vaccination.

Edit: I fully agree covid is now endemic and vaccinated people will still get infected. My real worry is the effects of a new wave of lockdowns on the economy and markets.
No need for a 'warning' This virus is here to stay and we will just have to live with that. We live with the flu and other airborne viruses, same here. It's not going away. We will build immunity as we are exposed and eventually it will be a non issue for most people
I 100% agree. What I think people are underestimating is the impact a new wave might have on the economy. Supply chains are already completely funked as it is, still markets are at all times high. I can't help but wonder if there's a huge correction incoming.
it's a non issue for most ppl already except for all the red tape involved.
That's been clear for a while since you still get sick and spread it even with a vaccine
Germany said"its a pandemic now of the unvaccinated"
Bro covid is over nobody cares
so....buy tech?
lol the people that aren't taking it seriously now weren't taking it seriously 6-12 months ago. what makes you think they are now going to listen?  These retards think *they're* the smart ones.
The other day I posted about this here and got massively downvoted. I suppose there are a few people who might actually listen, but you're right.
Deaths are what are most important after vaccination. The vaccines don't prevent infection after about six months, they just make it super mild.
It‚Äôs already been proven vaccines barely help against getting and spreading the virus. They are great at preventing death and that‚Äôs all anybody cares about.
Like most things in public health, this is where it gets tricky. While  vaccines mean much less severe cases, if hospitals get overwhelmed, you get a spike in avoidable deaths. Governments have had enough time to prepare now, so hopefully it won't happen this time around.
I agree a 100%. Governments are probably more prepared in case hospitalizations rise again, but I don‚Äôt think they will as long as people get vaccinated. That‚Äôs where I think people get vaccines wrong. They lean on vaccines to prevent spread which science has showed is not true. Keeping people out of the hospital is way more important, and vaccines do that.

So we not talking about MRNA crash and burn?
Already moved on.
mrna was always gonna crash and burn. just  like tsla and nvda if you hold too long. just need one earnings miss and BAM! instant death
is the dwac play over?  i'm still even should i get out and move on?
Everything Mango touches dies
I have August vibes right now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs going up and up. When is that pullback coming though.
As soon as the buying and the FOMO stops, no one seems to be selling.  I have some dry powder waiting for the pullback but until then I'm way bullish.
I did read that November is a historically solid month. The only times it‚Äôs been around -5% has been in 1929 and 2008. Neither of those are currently happening right now.
Thoughts on SQ EARNINGS? Will they beat or miss it?
> I don't care.
Right. Its TSLA or SPY calls
I would steer clear. Losing their market share and no meaningful moat. They might beat but it looks like mostly downside to me.
Do you reckon it will have an impact on PAYPAL price should they miss?
I bought the PayPal dip (227.70) and will most likely ride it through the earnings on this coming thuesday. I have no position in SQ, BTW. 
Thank you

In the last 6 months it‚Äôs gone over 120 multiple times so now that fraud accusations have been refuted, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth buying right now because of potential catalysts that could shoot it to the moon.
u/robbinhood69 thanks to your comment about OPEN founder tweeted they made money in Q3 before earnings, I made some scraps today, really appreciate it

Non standard option
"These are options that don't have the standard terms of an options contract, namely 100 shares as the underlying asset. They are normally created as a result of a specific event, such as a merger, acquisition, spin-off, extraordinary dividend or stock split."

friendly reminder that there is still time to short QQQ during this little dead cat
Good luck with that. While I see the bears point, I also realize that based on yesterday‚Äôs FOMC we aren‚Äôt going back to the normal 2% interest rates until 2023 at the soonest, and supply chain issues are only getting bigger from here on out. Bears are fucked until a legit recession comes
nah, I don't expect a crash anytime soon, but we're entering stagflation market IMO
Why wouldn‚Äôt you short TQQQ if you‚Äôre so confident
Because I'm a good options trader and know that there is no point in buying options on leveraged ETFs?
I shorted would SPY. Resistance on it is clear
IV on NET options fucked me last earnings. I expect it to be the same here. I think we see a drop, but nothing big, and to new ATH tomorrow. I picked up a few super out of the money calls and puts for cheap in case it actually makes a big move.
Holding puts. They are overbought in my opinion. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
I agree, but if they crush earnings it‚Äôll be justified and I think they crush. Still see a sell off but fucking IV. Happened last time too
Tsla needed more bears to fly higher since it stalled out. I hope
bears trying, and its already back up to 1229.22 

in fact theyre trying to take everything out apparently. 

MM are pissed and bleeding money.
So $F has announced a buyback of $5 billion in debt, but someone says they have over $125 billion debt overall. So is this good news, or bad?
Good. They believe they will make more money from stock increases than interest on their debt. I'm holding my leaps til expiration probably. 20c is still pretty cheap for 2022
Well, they also have like $300B in assets so y'know, probably good I guess?

I need actual help! Almost every position I sell to early, make gains but not BIG GAINS. For instance sold AMD this morning for 50% checked just now and it would‚Äôve been 110%‚Ä¶.. anyone else with the same issue
Your complaining about profit..?
Have a plan before you go into a trade and stick to it.  Then you never get out too early or too late.
Most people here in same boat. Thing is if you want to win big you have to be able lose big. That‚Äôs a hard adjustment to make in ones mind. Oldtimers would tell ya slow and steady wins the race. Retards would tell ya to YOLO. I‚Äôm considered a retard among my peers but am conservative compared to a lot of people on here because I have a hard time stomaching more than a $2,000 loss in a day. The pot stirs both ways
Good point, I guess I‚Äôm quick to sell if I‚Äôm losing as well. +\- 10% on a position and I‚Äôm out .

I'll list my earnings plays for EOD today and you guys can tell me which ones you think are retarded.

SQ calls, PINS puts, UBER calls, ABNB calls, PTON puts, DKNG puts, COIN puts
all of them except UBER ABNB and SQ
Pton was a pandemic play same with Pins. Now that pandemic is easing they will most likely miss earnings. Coin insider selling before earnings. Dkng im not too sure on so I might just avoid
UBER and ABNB are gonna do great, COIN and DKNG is a gamble, SQ is setting up a reverse H&S pre earnings so it‚Äôll prob run, PTON is shit so yes 80% good
I honestly thought COIN would be an obvious buy but there are insiders selling before earnings and from the ROKU experience that's a very bad sign
Why in the ever loving **fuck** do I have to *manually* pay my fucking progressive bill when they have my fucking bank info saved. Why the **fuck** is there not an auto pay?
Mine auto pays, idk what you're on about. I even pay only twice per year

Set up Autopay my guy, they do have it. worst case scenario you might have to call in, worth it though

hmmm interesting
i kinda doubt that though, energy hasn't really retraced at all. usually it goes down b4 it goes up.
Huh
Look at the QQQ chart
Could be more volume tomorrow
Possible but the technicals say overbought. It ripped 50 points straight up.
I own Pfizer but if youre an adult Moderna is the best vaccine
However Pfizer has that big brand name appeal all over the world and they got the market for under 18 vaccines

Then again Moderna stock had run pretty high. Pfixer has like 100 other products, Moderna has like two
Yeah best vaccine doesn't go very far if this isn't an infinite pandemic.

Bears dont realize Tesla is actually worth more than this on fundamentals. They leave out a lot of things in their arguments. I even see Tesla share holders saying they think the price is crazy. Just remember...Elon said a while ago there is a non zero chance Tesla could be the biggest company on earth. He may be late, but hes not wrong.
There is a non zero chance the local pizzeria next to my house will be the highest company on the earth.

Do you understand what non zero means?
Can you read a 10-Q? Now read several of them and get back to me.
There is a non-zero chance I can read a 10-Q
Then you can figure it out yourself. Congratulations!
it's like the most overvalued company in history and anyone who doesn't see this is absolutely brain damaged. still buying calls
Its really not tho. You have to do the math on it.
Lmao. I would be willing to bet my life I have done much more math on it than you. They would need to build about 60 gigafactories by 2030 to hit a sales number that would even on the most generous possible terms justify this multiple and then dominate like 2 other global industries which they have basically no purchase on right now.

Anyone who thinks this valuation is justified is dumb as dog shit. Still buying calls tho
[deleted]
he has the brain of a sparrow
So you are just looking at the number of cars sold?
they are an auto manufacturer whose net income is entirely from sales of automobiles and related regulatory credits so yes. they have some small start ups also developing inside the company but there's no reason to believe TSLA is incubating a high margin tech company that will take over the world. It's just a fantasy
Whats their margin?
dO tHe MaTh On It
They‚Äôre only making a profit cause of the regulatory credits. So overvalued.
They make profit without those credits.

The company has one factory in gyna and a tent city in usa.

This is the future, only calls!
But the retards holding shares and buying calls are the ones making money.

Stockholm syndrome. TSLA sells cars dude... Cars. Not rockets, not the SPICE melange... Cars. They are worth plenty but not the ENTIRE US Automotive market COMBINED. They are this generations Oracle. I don't know when the stock price will come back to earth but when (not if... when) it will be fast and it will be violent...
Until then, buy calls, got it
This guy either trolling or hella dumb
You know the auto market and energy are the largest markets on earth right?
Welcome to the second coming of the dotcom bubble, where fundamentals do not matter and all that‚Äôs needed to justify valuation is a CEO saying his company is going to the moon.
Most bulls can justify the price pretty easily tbh (with fundamentals)
Fundamentals do ultimately matter. Luckily Teslas fundamentals can back it up.
So ford really going to try to make electric cars to keep up with Teslas??? Ford and GM can burn to ashes for all the shady business practices plus the planned obsolescence. Imagine if TSLAs left you on the side of the road every two months because of a fucking sensor. Die Ford, die.
Spoiler alert the Tesla‚Äôs will leave you on the side of the road every 2 months but they got mobile service and fast towing .

Also since they basically  only sell the model 3 they fix them very fast at the shop
Yes they will and no they won‚Äôt keep up

Times up
Go schedule a service appointment with Tesla right now and see how long it takes to get in. Thank you for this moronic comment though it made me laugh
Not interested in the opinion of a hillbilly with mustang poster on their wall probably gets in fights over car brands lol
Time to take TSLA profits boys
Nope
Get vaxxed
Nah, they taking away our rights..
Not til I find out what it does to y‚Äôall in 10 yrs.
Just bought all the gme i can :)
Come on LCID and GME, please just go up instead of down.
You done goofed
NVDA buy the DIP!!!!
Tesla isn‚Äôt going to 1300 by tomorrow dipshits
so 1400 it is
it'll be 1300 next week
Be a lot cooler if it did
Only a matter of time until TSLA is 25% of the entire stock market at this rate.  Govt will be forced to prop it up because it'll be disastrous for the economy if it ever craters.
That‚Äôs likely a reason why Musk can blatantly violate SEC orders.
How we feeling about PYPL calls going into next week?
I picked up a few 300 leaps for sep next year.  I think I‚Äôll add more to it as I raise more cash

Most of your generation would rather buy a pokemon card worth 400K today, vs buy 400K in Gold or Silver...  LMAO... we are fucked.  Imagine living back in 1400's and you buy a picture for 400K vs a hoard of 400k worth of gold... HAHAHAHAH I can't stop laughing.
Wtf can you do with Gold
Sell it to CA$H 4 GOLD for 10% of its value
Eat it
I could take my gold and liquidate it immediately for whatever the dollar is worth... For the last 5k years, gold has been currency.  A computer can't hack my gold.  AI technology can't hack it.  If I lose my password I won't lose it.  So I can do a lot with it.  WTF would I want to transfer it's value across the globe if it is a store of value like kryp toe.  This generation has caused a massive over valued pokemon stonk market.  I will laugh when it goes boom.  Until then, enjoy degenerates making citadel rich.
Gold is for dinosaurs.

Where are 5 reasons
5 reasons why GME will will trade back to $20 fast and why Andrew Left knows more about short interest than WSB. Aged like fine milk!
Ok. Sorry. I is retard
We all is‚Ä¶we all is
Yeah it seems to be out of steam now, moving up/down a couple dollars on very low volume (<40k) compared to usual. Are you actually thinking of buying puts on it tho?
lol the GME saga will really be eternal huh
I'm sorry for you
Short term puts, I‚Äôm not anti-GME, but the January and March pumps I looked back and wish I would have added puts to my strategy. I did in June and cleaned up!

I‚Äôd eat the PDT if the gains were high enough. Can always come back later.
I would if I didn‚Äôt have other open positions that I need to close tmrw smfh

#SAVA GME AMC
Yes, load up your bags now after they popped off and not before!
Y‚Äôall really think people aren‚Äôt gonna start taking profit on TSLA lol
GME pretty please
AMC on an upward trend with Earnings on Monday. Sorry for being part of the echo chamber, but AMC is going to explode to the moon. I don‚Äôt make the rules, just trying to make some money along the way. If it doesn‚Äôt moon, all the apes who bought between Jan - Nov still aren‚Äôt selling (for a presumable loss) if they‚Äôve stuck around for this long. IMO, a safe floor due to the ape culture and an unlimited ceiling.
Safe floor?

They are going to be posting another loss on Monday lol
Floor as in, apes have been holding firm for almost 1 year now. They amassed a cult like following with stronger conviction than ive seen compared to any other stock (exception tsla). The community is not giving up on AMC that easily - securing a floor for other traders to jump in. I hope that makes sense.
The AMC CEO would just dilute and create more shares, which he did before.
Soooo Tesla had 38 Billion in shorts on it a few weeks ago. The largest short in the history of the stock market. Would explain why all these bears are coming out of the woodworks trying to convince people to sell. Lol. Imagine covering 80 Billion! I doubt they can.
Pigs like you get slaughtered. Pigger
Says bears who didnt take profit off of a 40% drop last year. $900 was last years price bro. Shoulda taken profit oink oink.
OR maybe there is a reason shorts are piling in when a  short term correction is due.
you've gotta genuinely be retarded to short tesla rn
Less retarded now than at any other time since it‚Äôs as expensive as it‚Äôs ever been. I‚Äôm not naked short but I can see why someone would
the momentum hasn't died, its just consolidating. just cuz it's overpriced doesn't mean it will fall.
I mean you‚Äôre right. But it doesn‚Äôt mean it will go up more either. Gotta admit shorting at 1240 is less retarded than shorting at 1100 is less retarded than shorting at 900 though right?
lmao just keep averaging down
This short has existed for years. It was even higher last year.
I‚Äôd like to speak to the downvoters and shit talkers in response to my suggestion that people take a closer look at NKLA
Trevor? Hope the people you‚Äôre referencing work for the SEC or DOJ
As much as this sub hates WISH, it has held this $5 floor for quite a while now. Any good news can easily send it $10+
And any bad news can send it down to $2
‚ÄúAny good news can lead to 100% gain!‚Äù Like what? The average spike off really good news is like 5-10%. Then it needs to have other factors or more good news to carry it farther.
Wish bag holders are my favorite. Especially the ones who know how trash the site is and how trash the products on there are and yet they still invested in it.
So should I sell my F?
It‚Äôs going up. It‚Äôs stake in Rivian will be worth more than the entire company. Just wait. I regret not buying at 11 like I should. I was a gay bear

So an apple/Microsoft EOD pump?
Definitely. I can‚Äôt even name any other companies in the S&P so yeah, AAPL and MSFT work.
I mean, Google, but it‚Äôs already up like 1.5% on the day.

they say they gonna announce q4. gme has its q4 yet?
> I assume you are asking about the Q4 earnings report for Glu Mobile. The company announced its results on January 25th, 2018 and they were better than expected. Revenue was up 23% year over year to $84 million with a net income of $1 million compared to a loss of -$11 million in 2016 which is an improvement from last quarter's result as well when it posted losses of -$5.8m
No, nobody has or ever will ask for the Q4 report of Glu Mobile.

I'm developing a new market thesis, which is that tha market is obviously fake, and it's completely controlled by the government. And that means SPY500 is almost a certainty, because if the market crashes under the Dems, they'll have no good thing left to stand on. They'll have destroyed everything.
if you've ever seen Hamiliton, you'd know this shit was rigged from day one. just be on the right side at the right time.

yeah, i've done my research bro
yes. biden cannot afford a market crash.
I warned you pigs to get out of tsla at 1240, sell wall is too big‚Ä¶. Now time for ya‚Äôll to get slaughtered. Greedy cock suckers of the cocks
Most of you don't understand that new information should change your bull thesis and it shows. Cathie was bullish on Zillow because of its house-flipping program, which they terminated. If you're bullish on something and it gets kill, you should not be bullish anymore.
Cathie is going to get burned so bad on so many things.
She bought the shares after they announced they were ending the program.  And sold them next day.  

So, no.
She bought when they announced they were suspending the program, sold when they announced they were ending it

I'm a üåΩ bull but even I took profit on MARA this week, made 40% off six months of bagholding so not so bad, will get back in under 55

I said that 6 months ago. Finally caved and bought a couple months ago. Up 47%
Are you me? My only regret was only getting 50 shares
Nah
I'm very happy NVDA is up 10% today. I cant remember the last time it was up 11% in just one day. It's crazy for a stock of this size to be up 12% while there's no actual fundamental news.

Crash Inflation coming in hot and being persistent is the most likely catalyst for another 1929. Inflation will reduce profit margins and will make the current multiples look even more insane. Catalyst: psychology changes. Technically upward momentum has slowed. I think we are very near the end tards. Pumpers downvote.
Downvoting because we pumping for 4 years and you won‚Äôt be hear to see it.

Poor
nah. Inflation will destroy people's savings and not much more.
What I don't get is why anyone would think this inflation is transitory. They printed sooooooooo much money
Great analysis‚Ä¶smh. Inverse this guy.
The sp500 is literally a hedge against inflation you fucktard .. noone will put there money anywhere else for the next 4 years .. enjoy the sidelines!!

After trading options, I'm never buying shares.
Although my biggest position is $150,000 worth of googl shares.
Net and TSLA puts just in case this is it
I still don't believe I sold my 50 NVDA shares last year in November at $300 (pre-split) because I thought that was the frikking top! Missed out on $42000 worth of gains, what the hell! üò° üò° üò° üò° üò°

do tech bootcamps have the potential to replace 4 year degrees? üßê
I want to know this too
Just a different way of learning. Will work for some, and not for others.

Same way self learning can replace a degree for some.
For getting a job at all?  Definitely.  Probably not at big tech who wants 4.0 and the ability to pass rigorous interviews but especially in a tight job market there will be people who will consider bootcamps as worthwhile considerations. If I'm looking for someone to work with codes/data I don't really care where they learned as long as they have basic understanding and can be trained to do what I need.

The biggest hurdle is that HR is retarded and makes up filtering criteria hiring managers never ask for and some hiring managers are idiots too and make up their own criteria that doesn't help anyone.  So you won't get as far as fast.  Still enough proof you can code should get you in the door someplace for a reasonable wage.  Then experience and title start to mean a lot more than degree after that.
Sure. You just have to be competent. Get your comptia a+ and start stacking certifications. Get a job doing help desk and learn all you can from there. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do
Can‚Äôt wait to jump into paypal calls but i refuse to until a trend change

I bought a bunch of shares of it. I think for calls visa is a bit better tbh, visa is a solid growth stock and trading under normal p/e and there is significant upside in it for next year. Under 230 is highway robbery
I just prefer paypal, avid user

Fair warning, TSLA is at ATH... GET THE FUCK OUT AND SECURE YOUR BAG. It don't got much more to go up but has a lot of room to go down. You boys already won now secure the win. For those sayin TSLA 2k.... That would mean tsla will be bigger than Apple, Google,Amazon. Too ambitious
Thanks, bro, already -$30 on my puts.
>That would mean tsla will be bigger than Apple, Google,Amazon.

We mean it would be bigger than all of them.. *combined*

bro you are already retarded asf by being in this subreddit, what's left to lose
Just get vaccinated ya fool. 

I directly know 6 people who have died of COVID and countless more indirectly. I know of 0 people who have died of the vaccine.
I‚Äôve had covid and it did nothing to me I shouldn‚Äôt be forced to take the vaccine
Same. I got vaccinated. I did get sick on the second one. My girlfriend got sick both times, but whatever. 

A good friend of mines father died of COVID last October, the friend got COVID at the same time as well . That same friend died this summer from getting COVID again.  Should‚Äôve gotten vaccinated.
If only there was a free solution to that "problem" ü§î

Oh well. Anyways...
being anti-vax is worth feeling bad about.  or you could just stop being retarded idc its your shitty life
Let me do me my guy
Just get vaxed. What are you scared of?
It‚Äôs more of a principles thing.  Realistically the vax is safe but is paving the way for too much government control down the line.
If you think it's safe then you should have been a man of principle and gotten it voluntarily.
So if the government mandated brushing your teeth would you stop brushing your teeth?
If they made me brush my teeth with mandated toothpaste yes I probably would have a problem and switch to charcoal
You getting fired will certainly protect future you from some unknown government boogie man...
Hope you don't wear a seat belt. Or don't follow any laws at all.

Laws are government control!
They can‚Äôt take my job cause I don‚Äôt wear a seatbelt?
Realistically the law is safe but is paving the way for too much government control down the line.

If I want to get in GME today should I buy at open or wait a bit? ü¶çü¶çü¶ç
Wait a bit. Always..
Thx brother
 No worries!
Can you elaborate on this? Why do you say that one should always wait to purchase after open?
The open is always the most volatile time of the day. It‚Äôs best to wait at least 30 mins. By 11:00 things start to settle down.
Appreciate this feedback, will add to my learning of stock investments. Thanks!
Glad I could help!

If you‚Äôre paying attention, you would have listened to Pfizer‚Äôs earnings call. **They raised vaccine guidance!**.

Like how you're lambasting Powell for saying the +2% benchmark is good to keep... because 2% is historically low and what he was saying was that you don't want it to go BELOW that because then asset values will crash and they'll have to ease again because the banks will be filled with toxic assets or go into a deflationary crash cycle.

But you don't know anything about finance or macroecon and you desperately want your puts to print, so you don't understand how any of that works.

That's why you guys took the big L yesterday... buying puts yesterday was a rookie move. Seriously like standing in front of a train asking for it to hit you.
2% is not historically low wtf are you talking about.

The press statement literally said keeping it ABOVE 2% will help anchor expectations.  You're fucking stupid.
2% IS historically low. The benchmark before 2010 was 3-4% and regularly went to 5% dumbass. LOL

Were you born in 2009?

Why make an ass of yourself and make a stupid statement like that?
Stop acting like 2009 to today is not relevant when the economic environment before the crisis was totally different and just toss that data away.  We have record low interest rates, inflation at these levels REALLY hurts right now.

Again you're ignoring that the Fed LITERALLY said that having it high would help anchor at 2% and that it was persistently low.  CB's have seemed to target 1.5% to 2% for a while now.  Where are you getting that they are benchmarking at 5%???
Slow your autism down, go take a walk and end your meltdown, and think about what you just said. 

For the past 10 years, average inflation has hovered around 2%. Prior to that it was higher, and there are a variety of reasons for that. JP is talking about dropping from where we are to the old benchmark average, and you're acting like that's the end of the fucking world because you're a moron. That's what I was pointing out by pointing out that 2% is historically low compared to before the recovery from the last recession. I'm very much aware of the differences in the situation and you seem to have no idea how to think rationally about this topic. 

A reduction from approx 5% inflation to 2% inflation is significant, and would have a significant impact on static asset values... but you're not thinking about that because you're stuck in an idiot haze of anger and you've stopped thinking rationally. Your mind can only handle one track and that track is "inflation bad!"
Hovered around?  You mean below?
As in "sometimes it was a bit below 2% and sometimes it was a little bit above 2%." I'm looking at the data right now, and for instance average inflation in 2018 was 2.4%.  
This is what you've reduced yourself to... You're playing idiot semantic games that require a fundamental misunderstanding of English in order to try to distort the reality in order to cover up that freaking out over a target reduction from 5.x% inflation down to 2% inflation is asinine. It's kind of pathetic. You sound like a jabbering buttplug.
And WHAT DID the Fed do in 2018????  Lmao your like a schizophrenic John Nash jumping from point to point without thinking about it in a broader context.

Supposedly you're a highly trained macroeconomist for 20 years from a prestigious university with a PhD deciding to write long theses on Reddit but you seem pretty fucking dumb to practical reality.
We weren't in a global pandemic in 2018 and the spending data doesn't demonstrate that this is inflation from strictly monetary policy, but we've already been over this. 

You talk a lot of shit for someone who makes dumb statements all the time. LOL

Sure, let's just ignore the global pandemic that's affecting the entire global economy right now and how that might influence things... in practical reality, you're a low rent moron. LOL
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS
I'm well aware of the fed funds rate, thanks, and I'm well aware of why raising rates now would be problematic and not create the outcome you think.

I've already explained this to you multiple times in the past but you're too fucking stupid to get it.
No you haven't.  You haven't answered why valuations pulling back a little is so terrible.  Because right now they just keep climbing almost exponentially.

No one is saying raise rates to 2% today.  If anything you're not justifying why markets are absurdly valued, keep going up, and why that's ok.
But you just said next year they should right?  Shouldn't they start to communicate that now?

I can fucking bet money even though only 2 people voted for 2 rate hikes next year, we have minimum 2 next year.
No shit it has an impact on valuations.  What is your fucking point?  If they're overvalued that's not necessarily a good thing lmao?

Maybe you need a walk bro or take your meds.
My point is you freaking out over 2% inflation demonstrates how dumb you are. LOL
2% while not great IMO, is acceptable with normal interest rates.

In record near 0 interest rates 2% IS really fucking bad.  You're an ivory tower dumbass if you think otherwise.

You keep saying things like "hovering around" it wasn't hovering around.  As soon as it began to approach 2% Bernanke acted.
First of all, I'm for increasing interest rates next year. I never once mentioned my position on interest rates or relative impact.

My point was simply that freaking out over a 2% target to keep asset valuations in line so the debt system wasn't destabilized was entirely reasonable compared to the past decade (where we also had interest rates between 0-2.4%).

Stop and fucking think for once: What's worse for retaining value at a 0% interest rate? 2% or 5%?

This is a directionality problem, and you're confusing it for an "ideal society" problem... but your ideal society position, like every position you take, isn't based on real world economics, only your whitewashed misunderstanding of economics.

If inflation dropped to 0% from 5% in the span of time you want it to, what you end up with is significant asset devaluation and that will cause a crash and major further devaluation, which is against the Fed's charter. You're only thinking about inflation because your simplistic misunderstanding of economics doesn't take into account that there are competing factors involved regarding balancing asset valuations and price increase. Too far in any direction from where you are now creates destabilization in the credit market, which is anchored with asset valuations.

Further, calling for less than 2% from where we are right now is unrealistic. 

And "hovering around" means to float around something. Bernanke flexed rates up and tapered, just like the Fed is talking about doing. People like you, who don't fucking understand economics, keep treating this year like it's like a normal economy when there's a fucking global pandemic in play... it's the dumbest bullshit argument ever and you should feel bad about it.

You simply do not fucking understand this topic.
Well most of the Fed voted AGAINST raising rates next year.  Actually even split in the most recent one but before then it was overwhelmingly against.  So basically you keep saying things like "I thought inflation estimates were way too low" "rates should go up".

Whose fucking side are you arguing lmao.
No one is fucking saying go to 0% overnight.  Who said that?

But 5% is dangerous and idgaf some egghead says otherwise.  Commodities and input prices are double in some cases to PRE-COVID.  This isn't entirely a "2020 baseline" problem.

Any macroeconomist that doesn't feel the urgency to bring that down which the Fed certainly is not acting like they are... is fucking stupid.
We all know there is a global pandemic.  It's the opposite, idiots like you use that to argue shades of gray as something binary.  They can act a lot quicker and a BIT more strongly than they have without collapsing the world.

Whatever they are doing is causing CAPEs to hit 40 soon.  They don't have to pump the market so aggressively and rapidly.
You're just making one straw man after another.  If anything, you're mentally masturbating yourself with semantics not me.

Who said 0% is what an "ideal" society should look like?  You're just making up bullshit.
I also went long and sold for 3x dumbass.  Just because I think JPow is a piece of shit doesn't mean I can't rationally make a bet to profit.  I do have puts too but my long position also covers them.  Payout for call spreads were absurd so it turned out to be a great hedge.

https://i.imgur.com/R3HLZmh.png

Also you're the guy that claims to be a "macroeconomist for 20 years right?"  If so, how come you geniuses were all saying inflation would come in at 2% by year end?  In early 2021 y'all were saying headline inflation wouldn't break 3%.

Post your fucking positions if you're so god damn smart.
I certainly wasn't saying it was going to be 2% at the end of the year, but I accept your strawman as an admission of your fundamental intellectual incapability.

Like any large group, there are some dumb people in economics. Some of the forecasts this year that some made were absolutely stupid... but extrapolating that cherry picking of idiocy into a broad statement and trying to apply it to someone else is, frankly, a sign of a person who never developed the intellectual equivalence of object permanence. 

You're obviously having a meltdown. I recommend going to sit in the corner of a dark room for 3 hours and separating yourself from all other people.
What about the Fed?  IIRC they expected inflation to be temporary only through the first half of 2021 and well under 4% for the entire year.

Am I cherry-picking idiots there?
At the beginning of the year, they said that, and I would agree that that was an inaccurate prediction. I didn't agree with it at the time, but I get why they angled down... it's easy for me to aim and say "I think inflation's going to be elevated" as there's no cost to me making a projection like that... if they say that, they start a panic. As inflation rose they adjusted their measures up beyond 4%. 

I would argue that you're cherry-picking, still, though because you're completely ignoring the contexts and everything said since then. 4%'s not wildly off from where we are, either. There are things, like the delta variant, that the Fed would have had to have gone out on a limb to predict at that time.

Your argument is a bit like saying "The weatherman predicted 85 but it was 80 out today, obviously every meteorologist and climatologist is an idiot."

Reality doesn't work the way that you think it does and you're so focused on trying to win a reddit argument that you don't realize how you look and sound.
Oh yea, I'm having a meltdown lmaoo. Making money hurts to much.  Hope you're egghead background has helped you actually play the market.

In any case post your damn positions ya bitch LOL.
News about fed activity has very little effect compared to the feds *actual* activity. That‚Äôs why we continued crashing when they *announced* QE and then exploded upwards when QE *actually started*.
Also, uncertainty was alleviated. People can plan now, and the planning says buy.

Correct. Earnings should come out end of next week at the latest

What's gonna happen next week when $LCID reports earnings of negative millions of dollars and is valued at same price as Ford? Stop buying shit companies y'all !
Why would shit companies cause the market to crash.
OP is confused. Saying the market will crash but then changing to saying ‚Äúhey don‚Äôt invest in crappy companies‚Äù as if the two are related at all.
That‚Äôs my point of contention as well‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Zillow didn‚Äôt just report shorty earnings; they fucking closed down an entire company division due to failure‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

As for Penn and LCID‚Ä¶.sheesh.
Yeah - they seem to be implying that companies that are inherently shitty and thus tanked are somehow going to be responsible for a market crash lmao.
I never said market crash I just said crash
Major crash of what, then?
growth stocks, meme stocks, everything that went up over 1,000% in 20 - 21 for no reason
The majority of your comment highlights that companies reported shitty earnings and fell (your words). Unrelated to a pullback on mega growth stocks. They are completely unrelated. 

I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree with the idea that stocks who blew up without much reason will possibly crash and burn. But you never said that.
the point is these companies have been reporting shitty earnings but still have gone up nonstop. now all of a sudden it matters? something has changed obviously and it's just starting
I don‚Äôt think you can base wider market behavior on what happens during ER. But do you dawg.
I didn't say entire market was crashing I said major crash coming
The two are not synonymous?
There‚Äôs a lot of overpriced crap out there

GM is gonna be huge on electric vehicles soon
They gotta lower their prices on everything.  They are almost double the price of their comparable models of other manufacturers. 

I‚Äôm a lifelong GMC owner. But they really need to focus on their non luxury models more.
I just thought their model was really interesting, I did not get a chance to check prices. all of their electric vehicles use the same base with different tops which seems cheap to manufacture in the long run
Yea their idea of having all the models be interchangeable with EV is very smart. I have even heard there maybe a way to easily make ICE GM cars convert to EV if you are so inclined.  Like I could take my 2012 GMC truck. Rip out the front end and replace it with the GM dc motor and batteries myself in my garage. 

That would be awesome. But won‚Äôt happen for a long time. 

Much better then Tesla. Where you can‚Äôt even replace the key without taking it to the dealer mechanics.

Right to repair or whatever.
I‚Äôm willing to bet on them increasing production to meet the demand of the market, I see this as a safe investment not including any lurking stock market pullbacks. That interchangeable front for old cars is awesome, I did not hear about that
I‚Äôm rooting for them. Like I said. I‚Äôm a huge GMC guy. But right now I‚Äôm looking at maybe getting the ford Maverick in 3/4 years unless GM comes out with something to compete at that level/price.

My FAANG portfolio printing right now
So the fed will taper this month.... Stocks rise? Can someone explain this to me I thought yall were saying its the other way
It‚Äôs just greed at this point
8t printed gonna be a while before it slows down
Everything can be justified. 

Fed keeps printing + stocks go up = fed is buying so no risk

Fed keeps printing + stocks go down = Market is concerned fed still needs to be printing, correction must be coming

Fed stops printing + stock goes up = fed thinks market is strong, no risk

Fed stops printing + stock goes down = most "logical" outcome and therefore least likely to happen
Ahhh i forgot... most logical is least likely outcome...
They are doing what's expected by the market.  Priced in. The only reason there was a taper tantrum before was that they didn't give a dozen warnings before announcing it. 


It also confirms inflation is a real problem (which everybody here already knew), which means cash is lava, so buy all the assets. By tapering, this will eventually slow the money supply and then they can raise interest rates, if nothing else bad happens. 

Also, unemployment is down again this month.  ISM numbers from a few days ago confirm comfortable growth.  The real economy is rolling so gradually turning the printer off isn't scary to anybody. 

And while September is a sad time for the market, November is usually strong. 

Tldr. Bears are fucked.
Good points. When asset prices do go down (homes) if rates rise, were fucked. But right now we're chilling.
Only if they go down faster than cash. So as long as homes have long term appreciation greater than -2%, or whatever inflation works out to, it won't make sense to sell them. 

This isn't 2007, many homes bought at these prices are paid cash. Some of these homes may never hit the market ever again, and could be the start of inter generational land lord wealth. Think boomers snapping them up with cash and passing them on to children and grand children.  The market prices don't matter if you aren't leveraged and don't need to sell.  That's who's been buying up all the homes this year.
Well I work in real estate. And yea i suppose when you look at the average consumer people are paying cash. But then they refinance them. Also the reason people are paying cash is because if they don't then they will get out bid by the numerous institutions that have gone around buying up SFR(single family). With interest rates so low... its stupid for someone not to leverage the fuck out of their homes. and the same for companies. Just look at zillow. They bought millions of homes and over paid for them.
also just to mention, I bought my first home in the fall of 2020... with the help of Cruises and airlines stock (not a big deal). My house is already valued 15% more than i paid for it. Im in the middle of refinancing.
My point is that this isn't 2007. These buyers aren't leveraged with ARMs and going to be homeless if the prices go down. They can hold through a downturn if they can pay cash. And there's an entire generation of millenials waiting to buy the dip.

Housing isn't going anywhere.
Well history doesn't repeat itself... but it does rhyme. No ARM's for the most part correct. But whats different today is that 60% of people rent. And now landlords, from institutions to mom and pop shops, have been paying the highest prices for real estate at the lowest ever seen cap rates (cap rate= Properties NOI/cost of property)... the thing is... if interest rates rise, then the cost of houses and monthly rent should go down. If rents go down and landlords go from a 4% cap to a 3% cap then theyll have trouble paying back their loans which they spent so much money on durring this low interest period. This is my train of thought, I'm interested to hear the other side. (in my opinion this will be a slow process because moset tenants are locked into a 1 year lease) (what ive seen so far is that housing and rents are starting to plateau)
Here's the other side. 

The 07 crash was mostly caused by fraud and leverage. Not expensive houses. Banks were incentivized to give anybody a house loan, without consideration to the credit worthiness of the borrower. This is why they gave out ARMs and interest only loans, they loaded the system with default risk because there was endless demand for mortgage backed securities, which were the backbone of billions of dollars of fund holdings.  The fraud part came in where the credit rating agencies were labeling these very likely to default vehicles as AAA, lowest risk bonds. When all those people finally did default, the big funds holding the MBS suddenly had a liquidity crisis and mass evictions forced tons of houses on the market all at once as banks scrambled to liquidate everything. 

If you are telling me that the system is full of hidden default risk after lending requirements have become much more strict than they were 20 years ago, and so many buyers are institutional and paying cash are somehow going to be forced to sell,  en mass, I'm all ears. But I see low leverage,  and a growing economy where people with secure, well paying jobs are eager to jump on home buying opportunities. I see institutional holders that could let properties sit empty for years without being forced to sell, and they actually need non- cash assets like property for their own balance sheets. 

Why would monthly rent go down with increasing interest rates? That's a huge assumption. None of the properties bought in the last few years will be affected by rising rates, only people just trying to get into rental properties would be affected, and that's assuming the cost of property goes down more than the increase in interest payments. 

In inflation is persistent, it's more likely that rents increase yoy, despite the cost of the underlying asset. Rents scale relative to full house payments (principal, interest, taxes, insurance), not to house prices. 

The only reason higher rates being prices down is because of monthly payments. Cash buyers aren't affected by that at all.  If rental rates are too high, it will be cheaper for people to buy houses at higher interest rates than to continue paying rent.

All that's slowing down is the growth in prices. We are entering the cheapest time to buy a home (November to February) because of the holidays and winter. Next year could be even crazier than this year, for real estate rental costs.
You ask why monthly rent would go down and then proceed to explain why monthly rent would go down. -> interest rates rise-> housing prices go down->People buy houses->less renters->rent goes down (due to lack of demand).

If you are paying cash for a house right now you are an idiot. The cost to borrow is near all time lows. If you understand this (as do all property developers) then you are leveraged to the tits right now with low rate fixed mortgages, and balloon mortgages, buying up everything you can. This is why institutions are now buying SFR (Something that has rarely been done) because the competition to buy MFR is out of this world. (again apartment complexes are selling for 4% caps).  

I appreciate the rebuttal but I cant see your point as to why you think rising interest rates wont be deadly.

Yea good one bro, everyone I know don‚Äôt have cars anymore since pandemic, all getting rides from Uber. I think so many more individuals in hardship have been utilizing the services.

Nope.
I will sell you my PUTS.
I don't have the cash to make any substantial gains of NVDA. You'd need at least 20-25 shares at this point. Rather go for something cheaper like AMD or SAVA
Buy Options dipshit
Hmmm up 930% on NVDA calls‚Ä¶do I sell or is this gonna run all week?
Dude you have a fucking 10 bagger.  Sell that shit.  Don't be dumb
But it doesn‚Äôt expire till 12/17
Roll up and take some profit
If you‚Äôre asking , just sell.
You have more time, sure.  But runs like this are so rare man. Lock in the profit, let it pullback and settle down, and then reenter a position if you are still really bullish
Hate to say it but ‚¨ÜÔ∏è is right.
Okay I sold. But I‚Äôll probably hate myself for it
You can't have that mindset in this game man.  You just made 10X on a play.  Undoubtedly covered several of your other losses recently and some.  Supplied your account for a while barring you make stupid trades now.  Use a HUGE win like this as a building block for your account, and thank your lucky stars you happened to be in on that trade
sell u monkey
Here comes the AMD sell off lmao
NVDA gain steam downwards and lose everything you just gained today...for a friend.
Crash after ER NET. You are the chosen one
You‚Äôll think it will miss?
The better question is, "Are you a retard?"
Yo. Anyone picking up ford puts? No way it's gonna slap 20 right
Pick up some
Puts and find out.
Disney‚Äôs PE is retarded and there is zero justification for a media/theme park company to be valued so extravagantly even with rapid growth.

I will not buy puts, but fuck that nonsense.
Replace Disney with any other company, replace theme park with any other industry.  It‚Äôs all valued extravagantly
Except it‚Äôs actually not though. 

FB has a PE under 24. MU is under 14. QCOM under 17 *even with this rally*. 

DIS is at **278**. They‚Äôre not even a fucking tech company. What is the expected growth? Disney+? It‚Äôs absurd. Nonsensical.
To be fair I went to Disney during the least crowded time of the year and it was more packed than peak seasons 10 years ago. I think if they keep modernizing and improving their parks, and the same with Disney plus it will go up over time. It‚Äôs the kind of stock you buy shares of not options
Disney P/E is pricing on full post pandemic recovery, their earnings were low due to pandemic and hence high P/E. That being said it is still overvalued but not to the extent P/E indicates
Ahh true. I‚Äôm an idiot, I didn‚Äôt factor in the Pe being skewed by the past year and a half of severely reduced profits.
PEs don't matter
The degree to which they matter really depends on the company/sector, but they absolutely do.
RemindMe! 1 year
I want Disney and Nintendo to team up
I mean as a consumer that would be dope, like I‚Äôd love that and buy shit, but I just do not see this valuation *ever* being justified.

It‚Äôs going back down to at least 800 if not 700 to reload for relaunch next year. Tesla moves like a crypto.
So TSLA is going to take down the SPX when it drops back to 700 I guess
Imagine being a dumb bull and thinking SPY will indefinitely go up $2+ every day forever

Bought NVDA puts. Time for market to dump
Shorts are Gona have to start covering on NKLA around 35% Sfloat
Why? NKLA is a scam company. They deserve 100% short float.
Doesnt' matter if it deservers it or not, the short play is so overcrowded that that going long will be super-profitable at this point
No. It needs a catalyst. That‚Äôs like saying too many people are buying NVDA so it‚Äôs super profitable to short NVDA. It‚Äôs just dumb. Don‚Äôt fight the tide.
The catalysts are the SEC investigation settlement and the general EV craze. Everyone who wanted to sell probably sold a long time ago, so right now the only selling pressure for the most part are people shorting, which is an already overcrowded play.
How can the capitalize on the EV craze when they don‚Äôt have any EV‚Äôs?
Have you been paying attention? You don't have to be a profitable (or even legitimate) business for your stock price to rise significantly in this market.
It‚Äôs not that simple. Ford has a mustang EV out now and they‚Äôre not rocketing.
They grew 50% in a month what are you talking about, "not rocketing"
High of 16 after release. Now at 19. Not rocketing yet bro but close
Really thinking of throwing 15k into SQQQ.
Do it on the 11/12 8 Calls
if you're a TSLA bear, instead of buying puts and paying for IV, buy SPY or QQQ leaps puts.  Cuz when TSLA dumps it'll likely take the whole house of cards down.

I have to do a deposition today‚Ä¶ any advice?
> "The deposition is a formal interview conducted by an attorney for the purpose of gathering information about relevant facts. The deponent (the person being interviewed) may be questioned in open court, or out of court, depending on the circumstances."
We are such a helpful bunch
Lawyer here.

Keep your answers short and responsive only to the question you are asked. Do not volunteer extra information that is unresponsive.

If you don't know, or you can't remember, say "I don't know" or "I can't remember." It is not a guessing game. 

If the questioning lawyer has an aggressive style, don't let that bother you. They are either an unhappy person, or that's the style that they think works best for them, or both. Just answer the questions.

Don't argue with the lawyer, that's a bad look.

I don't know if you're a party to the lawsuit or just a witness, but the better you come off as a witness, the better the odds of "your side" getting the case settled.
Custody suit  on my behalf‚Ä¶. Crazy exwife‚Ä¶ her depo was yesterday and she inversed your non legal advice. I will will go into bot mode. Thanks man.
Good luck. Your deposition will probably be video-recorded, so keep in the back of your mind that it could be replayed for a jury some day.
Yes. Just answer the question they ask. No rambling. If it‚Äôs simple yes no question then your answer should be yes, no or I don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs it
Got it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll. E like the old VisualMod and not ramble on.
None of this is legal advice, I am not a lawyer, please listen to your legal council. 

Try to remember to speak without any hyperbole and to not get emotional to the best of your ability. Try not to say anything which you may have to clarify. It‚Äôs better to hesitate before speaking than to be pressured into misspeaking.
Remember, if the person giving you the deposition is hostile, they'll try to get you involved in it like a conversation with them, but it's not. It's record being established to clarify information for others who are going to read it in court, including someone whose opinion actually matters (judge or jurors). The point of the deposition isn't to have a conversation with someone, it's to create a printout that can get everyone in the court room on the same page about a given set of facts. That's really pretty much it. Save the emotions for the court room with the people whose opinions matter
Thank you. Will do.

Everyone giving legal advice and I‚Äôm just trying to figure out what  deposition means
Deposit usd
Give the simplest answers you can and try not to give a shit about whatever they're asking you about even if it's important. Trust me, it helps in court. Not pretending you don't give a shit in court, just the deposition. Someone who doesn't give a shit won't over-answer or under-answer anything in particular which comes across really well to judges and juries who have to read everything you said

So like do Nvidia GPU's go in stock anymore? Like just for a second so there's a small glimmer of hope of snagging one? Or is there basically zero chance for the next couple of years?

> If you are waiting for the new series to come out, I would advise against it. The 3080 will likely be released at a higher price than its predecessor due to limited supply and increased demand.
Wait for the changes to Etherium next year.
So happy I bought mine 3080 last year November for normal price in smallass local shop. Practically impossible to get it anywhere now, I received offers to sell it for double now.
If you live near a Microcenter you can get one if you are diligent. Check the unofficial store discord and be ready to drop everything when they post a restock.

So BABA still hasn't confirmed earnings date/time .. looks like something bad coming out
I played HIMX pretty conservatively selling lots of puts, will likely just close those at open and open calls instead for more upside.
I‚Äôve been holding calls for a week with no plan like an idiot
I figured earnings would be strong but that it might take a couple weeks for stock to really come into favor and go on a big run which is why I sold puts.

Watch the ROKU and MRNA bid ask spread when playing the inevitable dead cat bounce..super wide. No market BUY!

I‚Äôm holding 10/19 spy calls. Should I sell them or keep them for longer?? I‚Äôm making a shit ton right now
You‚Äôre holding October 19th calls? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/19*
Hold until Friday, take profit before the weekend, re-enter on Monday
Interesting. Can you explain why?
Fuck you that's why
At this point, do I buy NVDA $300c for 11/19? Too risky? I feel like it's just not gonna stop for a while.
Very surprising NVDA hasn‚Äôt hit 1 Trilly yet
Just sold all my 275‚Äôs for the end of the month and bought 50 300$ calls for tomorrow. So hopefully that answers your questions
Lil too late bud
Earnings run up might push it through before then. My 300C 4/14 is +184%. GL
Hope you bought brother, easy 30k on my calls today

man no love for pton or dkng heading into earnings. maybe they won‚Äôt shit the bed for once
Would love that but pretty sure PTON is going to dump again.  Fucking worst stock I've had.  Should have sold anytime in the past six months and put that money in almost any other stock.
yeah i can't quit it for some reason. probably going to get ravaged again, but at least i have my tsla calls to bail me out. maybe tread sales will be better than expected, or they announce a new product or some shit
Are you following pton at all? I still have shares I bought at $20, but the competition seems tough
> The competition is tough. I don't think you should hold your pton shares any longer than it takes to sell them for a profit
i try to keep up with news on them, but not really heavily scrutinizing everything. own the bike and personally love the product, ofc that means nothing for performance and market perception. competition is there, but they have an advantage as a first mover with scale and brand recognition if they can just continue to execute. supply chain issues probably going to fuck them again this quarter so not really too optimistic, though expectations are also in the shitter so any remotely positive news could turn around sentiment
You do have a point, even though I see ads for other products, I can't even remember their names, at least not on the high end.

Supply chain issues probably affect their competition as well. Hopefully you're right, but it's too sketchy for my blood, good luck!

Anyway, for the followers of the GOGO story, 100% earnings surprise and still high short count. The 19 calls are a hell of a lot cheaper than when I bought them, that's for sure. Good thing the market was crazy today and I more than made up for the haircut on these calls. Particularly, I'm glad I swung TSLA calls yesterday!

Waiting for ATVI to jump up to 70 EOW so I can unload my calls. Also pretty pumped to play the new Call fo Duty Vanguard tomorrow night.
May finally buy a new system so can play
Buckle up apes
Pump it TSLA I am ready
MRNA to $200
Lowkey watching for a double top here, not that I want it to happen
Uhh NFLX? Is there news?
thats....weird.
ouchies
3% down?

Thats nothing.
Straight down? On a Green Day?
Yes. That happens all the time.

Do you think money is pushed in equally across every stock?

3% is nothing.
Damn my paper hands
ima open a 12/19 250 call for pypl if it hits $220.29
LSPD down -30%.
Closed all positions this morning, feeling some type of way for this afternoon ü•¥
And fsly dying like a rocket trying to hit Jerusalem.
F me. I bought a few LEAPs. Guess I‚Äôm gonna run some poor mans covered calls
What level?  The calls I sold were used to buy Dec expiration calls at a higher level.  I think we'll get back to $80 on this at some point in the next 3-4 months.  I think LEAPS are ok.
I bought 50c for Jan 24

Not a big loss yet. I have long term hopes fo FSLY
I played put spreads but bought back only the covered side. The more it goes the more I recover.
I killed it yesterday with the IV.  Had average shares at like 46 and then bought at 52 and sold calls expiring tomorrow for between $4-$6.  Thought for sure they would be optioned and called away but now, not so sure.  May retain some shares.  Less complicated than your move but seems like some money is good.

Square or PayPal. Or they stay their own thing and their stock goes berserk. They have a moat and everyone knows it. They are hiring M&A attorneys on LinkedIn so there's that too LOL. This stock is a millionaire maker IMO
Are you share, options or both?
I have both. Trying to work out a strategy. I think earnings will be great. I think who ever is going to acquire them would want to do it sooner than later. I have to work on an options strategy. Thoughts?
I'm the wrong guy to ask. The only options I ever do well on are LEAPs. Any short termers, I guess wrong. I hesitated on buying a weekly for QCOM at close yesterday. GUH.
Why the fuck i invest in pos? Jan 2022 55 strike $snap calls is down 30% fuck

they're all going up at least another 1000% so at these levels, they're super, super cheap

NVDA gave a little back. It's been a hell of a day.
Hate to say it but looks like it‚Äôs time for F puts
Don‚Äôt get emotionally tied to a ticker. We buy it when it‚Äôs slow and sell it when it‚Äôs high. Definitely getting into overextended territory now and we know it likes to move a long way in each direction. I want a little more confirmation tho because F can get you with the last minute exhaustion runs. I tried to time the top of the last run when it looked like it was topping at 15 and had to endure some pain temporarily when it surged past.

Would it be illegal for a company to report earnings twice per day?
> No, but it would be a terrible idea.
Visualmod don‚Äôt miss lmao
I don't get it, how?
It‚Äôs an automated reply but it is very accurate
Lol @ you thinking it's actually automated. I'm asking how it's accurate
You think it would be a good idea to have earnings reports twice daily? Lol
Yeah, it's like doing it once a day except you could have an earnings period that's only during market hours so it would be more optimal for traders. What's the big flaw I'm missing?
Why would it be a terrible idea?
If my stock accounts go up just a bit higher than inflation, technically I‚Äôm still winning right? Only poor people without gains are hurting so don‚Äôt be poor‚Ä¶
Nvm, just did some digging and found out while it's not illegal to report earnings twice a day it would still be illegal to report earnings during active trading hours because it's illegal to do that with any "news."

What's to stop a company from just having a web page that tracks hourly earnings updates though? Surely the SEC can't argue that each update counts as "news" when it's a website that updates automatically every hour

Anyone have thoughts on a Carvana puts play for earnings? I can‚Äôt help but think if they miss earnings that the stock will move big time with the news that the strategy ended so poorly for Zillow. I know it‚Äôs a totally different industry but the idea is the same.

Tesla falling cause some dude sold like 1/10th of his shares lol?
Maybe it's falling because it's at 500p/e and anyone with a brain would take their lottery winnings here
Lol yeah cause the stock has proven to make logical sense the last 2 years hasn‚Äôt it? Boomer.
Boomers are invested in Tesla

At least use a logical insult
Boomers invest in Ford and Chevy‚Ä¶..
Lmao. Sure Tesla has a 1.3T market cap, but it's just cool internet Gen Z kids investing . Uh huh. Whatever delusions you need to justify being balls-deep in a stock with a 500 p/e ratio lmao.

Chevy isn't a stock btw

If any of you autistic regards wanna make a safer play that doesn't rob your account over night. Look at the March 18th Call options on Cameco (CCJ). These things are insanely cheap for the run up uranium has had over the past couple months and will continue to print. Just buy and hold through these swings. CCJ PT by BofA is literally $32 (currently 27).   


Buy an option that's safe if you wanna make some decent money. Won't get rich but chances of you losing your moms money is alot smaller.
That's a specific date. Almost like you have calls you want to unload on some unwitting autists.
Fuckin buy whatever date I don't care. I'm not unloading shit. Already ran up from when I bought them yesterday. There might be better expiry dates. i honestly just have most my money in uranium stocks and am playing long on uranium calls because of volatility in the uranium market.
$TSLA puts lookin like the move right here....

its gotta come down

Yes

RBOT set up continues to look good ‚Ä¶. Shit ton of calls written, close to 4m shares worth, together with 1.6m shares short and a free float of less than 8m ‚Ä¶ all on a great underlying technology that will disrupt ISRG. Good near term and long term hold

Today seems like a good day to free up some cash and reload some 30-60dte UVXY calls.
So how long does it take for Atvi to go up? I honestly think sooner than most people expect.
might take a while, or it could pump massively this week. That said there was massive volume yesterday, if it runs out of sellers it could suddenly jump.
I think I‚Äôm going to close all of my February QCOM calls and most of my June calls. I‚Äôll leave 5 of the June calls open. 

I feel like there‚Äôs going to be juicy Vega baked in rn I‚Äôll want to lock in

Why would we go down? Thats gay
MRNA's tryna take the whole market down but SPY's not havin' it today.

I wonder how many bears got completely washed out yesterday and this morning. I don't really have a side, per-se, but with all the shitty bear TA and DD lately hoping for a major crash that's basically just a bunch of blind, contextless pant-shitting and one trendline on a 40 year S&P 500 chart, some humble pie's in order.
Cassava hype may be real, but their drug works on a similar basis as cortexymes, and you can see how well that worked out for them. Its a large risk holding past this pump.

Told y‚Äôall about NKLA yesterday. Nobody believed me
It might not have been you but somebody did right before close yesterday so I tossed some into weekly calls. If you told me nkla would print me a couple k this morn I'd have called you crazy

If you're not holding tsla and you didn't buy spy calls yesterday/this morning, why? I'm curious what low key plays are printing for you guys today. Tell me a play that paid off today that you didn't find on WSB.
Ford. I bought Ford and GM calls about 2 months ago when they dropped hard. Paying out +500% today.
Thoughts on LSPD?

Big drop in price represents a chance to buy shares cheap or an opportunity to hold bags
> LSPD is a company that will eventually go bankrupt.
Golf isn‚Äôt as hot anymore
Golf is more popular in the last 2 years than it ever has been before
It was, but it's cooling off now. For a while it was all anyone could do, but now it's going back to normal.

Name your actual top bets for AH that no one is mentioning
Sq because surely it won‚Äôt go down more after earnings.
$BJ - everyone likes BJ's, undervalued, earnings on the 17th.  Ripe for a multibagger
No joke, found out my second cousin was the CEO of BJs when he dropped dead on a jog earlier this year. Had no idea
P/E ratio 20.8

$61.81 today, 52-week high is $61.95

Yahoo says earnings on the 18th, not the 17th, but Yahoo may be wrong

Tell me how this is a multi-bagger and undervalued, I am listening.
CNBC is showing the 17th so who knows.  PE of 20 seems low relative to peers.  Obviously COST is the wholesale goat, but they have a PE of 45 and have been running up hot over the past month or so while BJ's hasn't nearly as much. Chance to continue pandemic fueled growth. Options are pretty cheap at the moment, seems like a good gamble to me.
Anyone buying PENN?

Feel like the time to do that was yesterday
I dunno I bought them as soon as the news broke about Portnoy and made a grand in less than a half hour

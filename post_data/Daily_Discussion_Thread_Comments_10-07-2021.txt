Fuck me. Apple is gonna pop after hours.
PENCILS DOWN
#PENCILS DOWN RETARDANTS!
So what news dropped that cause this sell off?
Today I found out I could fuck myself
r/investing
Pretty much the worst end to the day I could imagine
hope i'm not poor tomorrow
Charts not red: let‚Äôs get this bread
spy defo closing at 440, trust me
Fuck it im holding these calls
Companies have made it harder to hire due to vaccines mandates

Tomorrow report should blow

If you French fry when you‚Äôre supposed to pizza you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time.

more selling eod tom?
Sold last minute Small Dick Club, I am afraid of tomorrow
fuck I missed the top, oh well can lock in what's left of me profit

that drop at the end of the day was a great time to grab 10/8 440c
there's still time...
Bury me with my calls
Buy mcd put lol Loco
Me too.  @ 300
What reason? Are they closed tomorrow too? Didnt realize
Even LEAPS.
LMFAO

the whole day was just one giant doji candle.... wtf.

&amp;#x200B;

SPY PUMPETH, THEN SPY DUMPETH....
Lost half my gains last hour, y'all aint even know it! üé∂
Lol what a fun market. We only need to solve like 10 more major issues and then we can get rejected at 441 again
Qqq daily candle ü§¢
I feel like i've seen legitimate long term research that proves selling by 10:45 is generally the right play - I feel like I've seen this type of daily price movement more than enough times to corroborate - if you blast at open, no initial selloff...you're gonna trickle down all day
Today was basically index plungers unwinding  debt ceiling standoff hedges for 2/3rd of day and then investors caught off guard by the September selling using the marked up prices to unload some bags.
stop saying zoom out, I know all of you have 1DTE calls
Loaded up on BBBY calls. I can feel a Jan repeat in my plums

Y‚Äôall keep getting burned trading options during a kangaroo market. 

We just went through a month of almost nonstop drilling. Everything is cheap as fuck, and starting fo go up. 

Just get in on this flash sale. Buy shares.
So sell at 10:30 and buy back in eod was the play
Yeah but the *quality* of green matters. Now it's looking like all the gains from yesterday's close will be from *after* market hours, which means less volume on this pump, which makes it less convincing
Drill team six did a shit job because its gonna close green lmao

007
aw yeah, when it does that spiky thing you wanna wait a minute
It's not even close to 439 bro
Does this sell off imply a red day tomorrow?
We could very well gap down to low 430s, upper 420s not ruled out!
It's OK to sell me your SPY November calls at a discount at close, I don't mind.
https://youtu.be/wg7fBLHIX5Y
Assuming HSI opening red since US markets sold off by about 0.8% in the last 2.5 hours of the day.
I have no fucking clue what tomorrow is gonna be

Its weird - big dump, but vix is still fuk.

Maybe buy some vxx calls before close? I wont, but its a play some of yall may want
If your entire gambling history was analyzed and given a gullibility score between one and ten where would you imagine yourself?

Epic üê∑ trap
Maybe it‚Äôs code? Maybe he‚Äôs telling us to buy puts on Spotify?
My gains are transitory
HAHAHAHAHA
Please see username
a tradingview integration would be insane
put now, sell at open and buy calls
If today turned out to be a bull trap setup for the biggest dump of the century from 438 to like 426, I'm going to quit investing until 2022 lmao
my puts are up 100%
[deleted]
Low ass volume day with a heavy fade, hope you sold your calls you cocky fucks
oh yeah?
Shit, that's what it is for me and I'm still not worried. I look for mostly oversold shit, like BABA and NIO, that have had a recent catalyst. Also got SQ, but that's held up pretty well through recent dips.
Did you buy calls at EOD even though we‚Äôve been dropping EOD like 3/4 days recently? Brave
TA is really valuable. We bounced off 441.7 resistance perfectly
[deleted]
Lol bulls with all indexes up about 1% ? Are u good ?
10/29 360 down 15%
For all you itching gamblers TSLA 800c for tomorrow, you're welcome
BBBY flying
Bout to be a triple bottom at 345 and 327.. low volume on today‚Äôs sell off says to me that big money is trapping bears

All these puts gotta expire worthless
As someone who bought 10/8 800c‚Äôs on Monday I can tell you it wasn‚Äôt dope
I got two types I forgot which ones. Waiting for the surprise bigly excited. Still got up
To 3 hours
lol bro zoom out

I think is going to go over 820 maybe after conference ü§î
Yes sir Captain sir. Drill team six will call it a day, but will be reloading supplies and ammo for a surge tomorrow
SOFI leaps seem safe, I parked a good chunk there for now.
You just hate yourself for buying it
who is this "we"? i'm down 70%

Holding!!!
Im liking spy put at close 10/11 i have been making money on calls
Bloomberg called the top. Volatility between 438 to 442 till something big happens
I recommend you look at the \*actual\* earnings release instead of googling like an idiot
I'm pretty sure they dogpiled into SPY last Friday and sat it at 434, the previous median.
lmaooo what the fuck guys holy shit.
I haven‚Äôt heard that whores name in a long time
We still green you fuking bearclowns
Buy SPY puts or calls now for tomorrow?!?!
ADP earlier this week was strong, so we could see that follow through in tmrws numbers. Regardless I bought TSLA fd‚Äôs

Tesla 840 calls or is that just a money in theta gang pockets
Yeah its a blip long term irl, but on here long term = week
puts easily earn ten baggers when timed correctly. calls earn less but at least it usually earns
I had to stop myself, that would have been dope earlier this week tho
LCID just said sike!!
You already know we are going to show above expectations and JPOW is going to light the printer on fire

Am I stupid enough to hood on to these Netflix puts? Yes I am
this fucking kills. it mooned in the am and flatline all day two days ago, so i bought puts. but then it kept rising for power hour. does the same exact shit today, but i get calls after getting burned. now it drops. fucking shoot me in the head. SHOOT. ME. IN. MY.  FUCKING. USELESS. BRAIN
These apes let the hedgiez run their stock down 12% in the last month, 3% in the last week. I'm disappointed in them. Hope they pick it up tomorrow, maybe they can move out of mom's basement.
JFC SPY, just get it the fuck together and pick a direction already.
Fuck it I'm holding. I'm tired of paper handing and missing out on gains.

Wow, this fucking market, only up 1%. Shut the fuck up
Yeah there‚Äôs no worse feeling than frantically trying to lower your stop but every new number you put in is already higher than the option price
Zoom out on the 3M chart and tell me your logic in puts ü§°
What you thinkin?
still kinda thinkin spy is gonna close near 440

+/- .50
Maybe, but if so, its not really that big of a deal. A correction to 10%-15% under ATHs would be decent.
TSLA 800c overnight if you're man enough
fuck it I'm waiting for the job report
Hi on penis maybe
What happened to spy $444 EOD. Rip to calls
Glad I bought calls an hour before close when it looked like we were going to rally into the close lol

tomorrow should be interesting with the jobs report at least
Sellllll!!!!!
435 tomorrow then up to 445 close

Just looked at max pain, you're probably right
You bought the tip of that shrek cok?
Profits aren‚Äôt profits though.  I can fuck your self with the irs if you‚Äôre not careful.  When you ‚Äòlock in‚Äô your profits, you basically immediately owe the IRS short term capital gains on that.  Then if you buy something else, go negative and wipe your profits, you now owe the IRS AND don‚Äôt have profits to show for it until you sell whatever you just bought at a loss (which most wont due because they‚Äôll hold on to try to recoup their losses).  I know someone who got a bill for 100kish from the IRS but was actually net negative on his portfolio because along the way, he tried to lock in gains and then made one bad move.
Dude shut up.
the best part is you could have sat out the entire day and not missed a thing

no thx
Not this week. Euphoria in da house
it is round. flat, but round
SPY -0.53% from HOD. Hm‚Ä¶.
I think the play is selling 0day ATM strangles on close.
lol yeah I think we‚Äôre red tomorrow
still looking pretty bearish, with spy anemic volume anything can happen
When expiry?
SPY can only report approx 1% up or down on the day, these are the rules
if you dont have $CORN puts what are you doing

Spy dumping a bit, but nothing really crazy. Had a big day today. Fairly bullish for tomorrow, sorta bearish on Monday tbh

Better plays out there unless Congress does something

Yep. I don't fall for any of that. I'm in tech stocks, defensive stocks, and meme stocks. Gotta diversify! LOL
yea it works until it doesnt. source: how i got my flair

Nothing different than if you buy one that's out of the money. If you hold until expiration and it's still ITM you'll get assigned tho.

I bought for 10 15 to get in on inflation report and FOMC minutes. 2/2 job reports beat estimates so far, if CPI is high again that's 3/3 in favor of speedy taper and higher rates.

Yeah I'm +90% since midday yesterday and I feel nothing because I know I'm going to get slapped with a -40% one morning out of nowhere and all the gains will be gone
is it more on red or green days?
Did congress actually seal the deal or is the whole market spluuging over optimism that they will get it worked out ?
With the jobs report and weekend approaching, SPY could be volatile tomorrow. 1DTE ATM straddles are around $320 each rn. That's $3 of movement in SPY in either direction to profit. Seems like a decent bet.
Meeting is after market
Bro what's with the attitude damn
Jan calls? What strike? Mine is otm and is down bad rn
Hope it goes further in the money
Unless you have weeklies and the market isn‚Äôt circuit breaking then just sit back and relax. Stressing will only make you paper hand and make you lose money.

Wait, isn't today TSLA Investor day?

Anything happen yet?
I got sizzled 2 weeks ago doing this
Ok SOFI, enough with the drill
It‚Äôs easier when you can put emotions aside from money. If you happen to have a life changing amount then making decisions is gonna be harder and thus you‚Äôre going to miss out cutting out losers and taking new opportunities. The more you have the harder it gets to trade. Gotta detach yourself from money.
here‚Äôs a thought, why not u lock in your profits?
That just tells me we're staying below 444

If you look at the $$$ flows, they have about a $20 range  (424-444) before it gets too expensive on them.

I've tried trading max pain and it only works when I don't. Better luck to you.

Trend-follow algos, where y'all at!

I'll like to increase my offer with a 35% stake in all of my calls
You can always tell if the market was green or red just based on the comment volume of the daily thread
Where exactly is Burry's TSLA position?  800p? 300p?
Not sure if I'd buy puts. Vix is doing shitty as fuck

Tesla still closing under 800 resistance, if it closes above it could rocket to 880 no issues

AMZN is long overdue for one.

Any minute now SPY
Shit was funny like a year ago. Get a new bit.
Meh, doesn't get easier. I lost $17k today on spy puts, 50% of account. Equally challenging to gain at any level
This drop in vol is both fake and üåà.


For that reason: I‚Äôm out.
this is a great opportunity to load puts for tomorrow. vix is down rather tremendously. disclosure: i'm holding calls i bought at the top that're down 50%
Leaked: Elon dressed as Palpatine to say: Now witness the full power of this fully functional dreadnought station.

It depends on how your 401 is doing, if it‚Äôs ripping and your contribution is negligible to your overall gains then lower your contribution for a month. If your returns are minimal though keep your contribution high. Just make sure you‚Äôre getting as close as you can to the max
Oh he's maaaad, fuck youuuuuu
I am down 35%.... so pls buy more. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Guys I had a dream of lcid going to $100. I went a in. And am I wrong or rretarded. 13,000 reserves at 80k each is $1b right!??
Not today, just typical cuckerberg antics
RIP Michael Burry, yet again.
Excuse me, I ordered a power hour, not this sour hour‚Ä¶ please take it back and being me what I asked for
You don‚Äôt have to be right either, just don‚Äôt have to be too wrong which is a lot different. It‚Äôs a lot less money but the people with big bankrolls don‚Äôt care bc even small percentage gains at that point can be thousands
SPY max pain for tomorrow is 434.
I can't decide bro. Someone help me. SELL TQQQ??? I went literally all in at $124.60. Doing OK right now but damn. It could drop like crazy tomorrow

I bought in at 333 so I‚Äôm down a bit. However I‚Äôm not worried at all. I have 10 weeks to break even in the worst scenario.

Edit: for some reason I‚Äôm still up. I‚Äôm guessing IV or lack of volume is pushing the value up
Corsair calls cheap afk

TSLA 800c 1dte went from 2.20 per this morning to over 8.00 per on that jump they had. Probably over 9.00 at the height of it, I didn‚Äôt check until it had already fallen down some. Hard not to like that
Puts 10% 1 day run up will correct a little for the next couple days at least even if it continues going up

Any news on TSLA for this 1% up and back in 45 minutes?  Who bought calls when underlying was hitting 805?
We flat tomorrow and errybody r fuk.
When Ginkgo dumped \~ 20% yesterday on that short report, I knew in my bones that was a dip worth buying. And it was.
Also helps keep me regular from all of the anxiety.

That's what I'm saying. Guess we'll see how it goes
Sounds like a theta gang bang
politely fuck off üòî
Can confirm
Market rallies on hope of a future with hope of a future rally
That mentality will blow up your account eventually. Your plan should include a price target either on the contract or the underlying where you‚Äôll start taking some profits and setting a hard stop loss below that to protect the rest of your profits. I see it all the time that people think they need to sell their entire position all at once or keep holding everything and miss out on gains because they didn‚Äôt just scale back at certain points.
Next week is the start of the earnings season.
dude stop spamming the same shit
imagine not having puts going into the weekend

Same here, except I watched the 1200 10/15 for a few days and didn't pull the trigger, then it jumped to 2200
They‚Äôre about to have bank runs with all those companies defaulting left and right. Tomorrow could get ugly
Would be hilarious if this caused the crash
Did you buy at 331? Fb has been drilling the last hour
well shit man that's $52. If it did that in 3 months we're only at 492. I'm selling lol jk but only kinda
Baba calls or puts for tomorrow??
Eod spy call or put?
So let me guess since everyone here is so bullish, the jobs numbers will come at a surprise beat and we dump in the pre market üò≠
just buy spy calls lol why settle for less
What about the Dole folks from last week?
Naked strangles? sounds like how I jerk my pudd

Be realistic about your gains and learn from your losses. Gain experience. Look for undervalued companies that you don't mind having short-term unrealized losses on. Don't gamble for the sake of it - act like you only have a tiny bit of your port left; you'll be way more careful when choosing something.
I need to take a moment to rant about something maybe some of you guys have gone through this maybe some of you guys are hiring other people to trade for you and I have some advice for you all .  For the love a fucking god if the person has option contracts that they‚Äôre selling and buying at the same time still open don‚Äôt log them out because you know what happens ,you get a phone call every 10 fucking minutes asking what should I do with this I don‚Äôt know what the fuck and tell you what you should do with that because I can‚Äôt look at it couldn‚Äôt straddle my play And now you‚Äôre About to lose a little over $20,000 because you didn‚Äôt wanna fucking listen to me. And on the other note when you have $10,000 in calls for Moderna and I tell you you need a break and straddle that play because its gonna dump ( dumped 30 dollars.) gonna take a fucking shit on you it means listen but now you don‚Äôt listen and you lose everything congratulations

taper is coming. we all know this. very soon. google if you don't believe. yields are rising in anticipation of that, you'll notice them spike before/when the fed speaks or releases notes. taper is precursor to rate increase

Yields go up in response to economy improving as ppl sell bonds to buy things that are higher risk/reward. you'll notice them spike whenever there's a good jobs report, for instance. Economy improving = rate increase comes sooner
Man, I wanted to make money off calls and puts both today and SPY ruined it. My 10/13 440p‚Äôs went from 3.40 to 3.95 and then right back to 3.40 so I sold them for breakeven. Got greedy. I was about to set a stop loss for 3.80 too when they were at 3.90 but they dropped through it too fast so I just thought well, I‚Äôll just wait until they go back to that‚Ä¶

yields going up is the exact opposite of anticipating a taper. no, if the market even got a hint of rate hikes, it would die. see 2015 and 2018.
I'm in NUE, cause I know cramer is going to pump it after market, and expect we're going to get a talk on supply chains and how energy is so costly in China/Europe now, that American steel has a huge advantage.
just a hint of TSLA split again please Elon. Make Burry cry.

I'm in it for the long haul, sold a bunch of ATM calls on it for next week on the pop tho.

Someone must have reminded SPY that tapering is still coming

Is chewy not an easy 2x at some point on the future? Shit has just been riding down
Civil War maybe. I thought the point was to either shitpost or talk shit
Wow Tesla about to announce teleportation
How can people be homeless? Like just buys SPACs.
Broke $800
Elon dick pic leaked
Buy puts and sell tomorrow duhhhh
EDIT/LOL: correction it was 30 fkn cents!! My ending statement for SEPT says $4.35....now my buying power is $4.05.

So you were close.....wait???

Vlad.....is that you???
For some absurd reason I thought entering a credit strangle on SPY was an amazing idea this morning. What the fuck is wrong with me?
Im diamond handing this shit guy high rewards or worthless
tesla going fucking ballistic
Ah, gotcha, nice, man. Well, sounds like you'll be doing very well soon enough. Best of luck, homie ü§ô
Wait til one makes u a years rent In a day. You will cheat
Fuck man, I wanna buy some TSLA calls, but know it will tank back down tomorrow.
Short the 900/910 call spread TSLA
Remember when CCP told its citizens that a bull market is good? Just wait till they do that again.

&gt;A front-page editorial in the state-owned China Securities Journal is getting credit for fueling a strong rally in Chinese markets overnight that spread to global equities. Shanghai stocks jumped 5.7%, after the publication said investors should look forward to the ‚Äúwealth effect of the capital markets‚Äù and the prospect for a ‚Äúhealthy bull market.‚Äù

your crayons don't lie
Interest rates are rising and people are buying TSLA?!? üòÇüòÇü§°ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
One of the fastest growing industries in north America. Its doubled in revenue every year(baring last year which was 3x). And 17% on commodities is killer. And their revenue was 510m not 230. 
** i have no holdings in tilray**
My baby Tesla is finally moving ü•∫ü•∫
selling my SPY 10/8 435c and 437c for a massive profit when it was up at 441 was honestly such a great move i'm surprised my retard ass managed to pull it off. still had to buy a tiny bit of 443c in case it goes back up for FOMO reasons, but uh that doesn't seem to be happening so far lol
FORGOT AB BURRY LMAOOOOOO
So Skillz really gunna lose all of its gains for the day huh
bc u sound like u don't know what ur talking about lol
Strike?
TSLA is the biggest scam ponzi shit to ever exist lol
What the hell Tesla. I was watching a 1200 call all day do nothing &amp; almost buying, now it's 2300.
I used to hate pickles, now I love them

&amp;#x200B;

Am I gay?
TSLA shareholder meeting must be the largest gathering of obnoxious know it alls ever



(I‚Äôm a shareholder)
holy fuk tsla run has started
how do I join theta gang
I'll show you a substantial package
A power dump incoming.
Ok bulls, which of you didn't sell your calls when SPY rocketed up 1.5%? It's ok, we are here to comfort you.
ummm, are y'all seeing tesla right now? what happened?
haha ok now yes TSLA puts
1DTE 437p.
TSLA with the big hulk dildo. holy shit
i used to love them but i don't so much anymore. saw them once and it was pretty good but the guests on this tour are the real stars. i feel basically the same about the strokes lately as i do rhcp but thundercat and haim and beck and anderson paak and king princess and asap rocky and st vincent are all in my rotation lately.

plus john frusciante is back in the band so that's pretty exciting. tough to choose which show to try and go to though
this TSLA fomo is unbearable bro. my calls are flat as shit!!!!
getting 2020 vibes from tsla rn
Good thing I sold my calls LOL
10/8 437p has 2600 OI and 40,000 volume, dayum
Holy shit Tesla .. why‚Äôs it running up??
Lmao volume is buy or sells
WSB always gets in late on stuff.
Do you know the power of that commodity though ? The amount of users it has and only beginning to become more popular as more research is done regarding its medical benefits. Don‚Äôt be ignorant.
Puts are finally printing. Wish me luck üòÇüòÇüòÖ
I feel we deserve a power hour after being so patient all day.
How'd you know?
Tesla good lord
3 minutes till power/sour hour place your bets gentleman and be civil. We're all apes here
It‚Äôs not published yet
Couldn't care less about any other individual stock apart from SPY
Easy to notice when your buying power was 4.20 to begin with
I mean look at the calls from 800 to 820. Fucking juicy. It's a bull fundraiser.
Modern technology is GREAT
Win bigly
Amazon can you go and buy BB? You already working with them with AWS on IVY. Your twitch shit got hacked and BB is highly rated for cyber security. 

Jassy make it happen.
You must not trade options lol
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
the IV is like 40% bro.. so uhh yeah?
You know what time it is

üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è-------+-------üêÇ
5k in TSLA calls last week, gone. $1k calls this week. MOON
powell hour?
Da bong ripppp brooo
if tesla breaks 800 and stays above 800, then I will go all in calls for earnings run up play
Tesla on the move
[deleted]
blame elon rip
No I switch between all three. It's like a palette cleanser.

&amp;#x200B;

DO IT MFer

&amp;#x200B;

edit: it did it!!! it did it!!!!
Elon was our savior all along
We're going to win so much you may even get tired of winning and you'll say 

*Please, please, it's too much winning. We can't take it anymore. Mr President, it's too much*

And I'll say

*No it isn't*
I heard Elon bested him in a gladiator style cage match
TSLA power hour.
I‚Äôm a data analyst. The benefits here are absurd, so if I‚Äôm in low six figs with the package I get it‚Äôs pretty substantial.
Wait you guys are excited about Tesla going up $10? wtf!
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Its starting to look a lot like Tuesday~~
They should add Jim Cramer as a Smash Bros character.
it's death by autopilot in the new update. 100% prevents death by cancer
What‚Äôs it gonna take for WSB to flood into BB? A big spike from here? Because it‚Äôs definitely coming.
Drill team 6 going in
Tesla is only up 1 percent you jokers imagine if it god up 8% I might only lose $100 on my calls I bought Monday!
TSLA go brrrr
It's just a trough.  Also Seema Mody is a hammer.
captain hindsight says, if you wanted to make money today, you should have bought calls yesterday
wow you are a genius
Enjoy the rip? Bro zoom out this turd has done nothing but bleed out since 2018 (minus that random meme pump in Feb)
59k volume on your 450c today ‚Ä¶ yikessss they dumping
SPY lookin like it ate Taco Bell all day and is dealing with the after effects üí©
We all know betting on SPY is a waste of time tomorrow so I grabbed a TSKA 10/8 $800C
Debt ceiling is old news.  Sell the news.  You new here?
If spy was up trending right now during this Tesla pump it would be over 810
Well I was having a good day
How many WSB members picked up some hedgie's bags today?
Depends.  If the fries need to cool down or not.
thats a good ole' fashion SPY cuck
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Oil plz go up faster
EVERYBODY RUN FOR YOUR LIVES
XOM prints pretty good, its why i tried, just bad buys in my end, misses but the move is there
Told you.  We fade to fill the gap and news story is 10 yr.   They feed you a narrative to steer the markets when they want to.   They only have to control the 10 yr to impact the entire market.
Not me, I hedged and made money on calls that I used to double down on my puts. Not convinced we are out of the forest yet but will grab more calls if we approach 438 by EOD
Our vey! Tesla giving some of that verga to y‚Äôall
Shoulda bought puts at the top and calls at close
algos can read and smell fear
Any of you renobs notice Robinhood taking 5 cents out of your account? My buying power def went down 5 cents in the past few days and I just noticed....and I haven't bought/sold anything since Sept 15. There is no record of the transaction anywhere on the app.

Prob a legal defense fund they forgot to tell us about?
TSLA is like mary jane rotten crotch. Feels good at the time but she doesnt tell you about her herpes because it isnt flared up at the moment and you think about how she treated you right in the past so you keep ging back and dipping your wick in til BAM.... then you feel it and it burns when you pee.
Um.  Up is the other way SPY.  Stop day drinking
SPY wants to fall off a cliff
I made most of it back on SPY calls this morning and switched to puts this afternoon. I swing both ways.
Shut up bitch
The green days don't feel like they used to.
Agreed, I been saying that for 4 hours.  This market is fragile for sure.  Bitch McConnel can only carry us for so long..
I will follow you off the edge of the earth 
 
üêª7
Do you eat the pickle after the burger and fries?
Fuck we broke 39, everyone scatter
Hoping for a power hour, but to the bottom side of my screen
Thank you Elon Daddy
basically same goes for all of s&amp;p üöÄ
[deleted]

Fed/Hedge Funds/Pelosi/J Pow most likely gonna send spy closing above $442. Only paper hands selling rn. Open $445 and $450 by 1 PM.

Debt ceiling most likely coming out tonight before the long weekend.
Drill team 6, line up and prepare to engage.
AEO is going BALLISTIC
stupid things making me miss stuff dang it
I feel like I'm winning because everything is green - pay no attention to the fact that my portfolio is down 36.99% over the last 3 months.
Who hurt you? Bruh sit back, spark up, and enjoy the rippppp
6 figs ain't that much, homie. Become a data scientist.

Elon found the cure for cancer in a Tesla
How do u guys earn money?
If it ends red today I'm buying 1DTE calls. And I'm a bear.
Pls god don‚Äôt reverse
Power hour= sell off hour
I got downvoted earlier for selling $435 Spy calls on today's pop and immediately buying puts afterwards. Pffft. I'll take profits over bagholding.
Ohhh SPY I knew you could do it
If it ends red today I'm buying 1DTE calls. And I'm a bear.
Give me another Tesla split so it can double in price again
##if spy keeps dropping I‚Äôm going to need a bigger cum box
And we have a new gap zone. Might end up bouncing off that as well. Next week is gonna be interesting
Omg Tesla rn
FB puts; it has entered the danger zone ‚ö†Ô∏è
this red hot chili peppers + thundercat and others tour looks wild fuck
What‚Äôs up, ber bro?
Cash is king.
Is it good at puts?
Today we‚Äôre friends, tomorrow‚Ä¶
Tilray is such hot garbage it‚Äôs unreal. $5B valuation on $230M revenue for a commodity agricultural product with low margin ü§£üòÇü§£ once the money printers are turned off this is going back to sub $5 where it belongs
Hey you there?
would be funny if it ends red today. and I would be rich lol
TSLA $1,000
Alexa play burning down the house üòé
You should quit if this is a realistic target on the day.
tslas the only thing moving much rn that i see
Just heard Elon cured cancer
Okay, bulls

Don't say bears didn't buy you dinner first
Believe it or not, you can be a bull and still be gay

But you can't be a bear and be straight
ugh I wish I was retarded enough to buy TSLA rn
Would be cool if stuff not in SPY didn't follow SPY.

Can somebody get Shrek some crushed Cialis, please?
FUCK THIS EOD FADE üòí Am I gonna sell my calls ? *you bet your candy ass im NOT* ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Shiiii mayneeee sorry for your lost. WTI trending up rn tho that's why I'm considering it. Something like XOM 62C 10/15
TSLA $825 open tommorrow
SPY 438 üß≤    
Intraday 200EMA + daily 21EMA = 438
Holy green dildo Tesla, did Elon cure cancer?
I mean anything is possible but I think Elon is nuts and will fuck up the meeting. I think TSLA will be 650 by January
We're going to win so much, you're going to be so sick and tired of winning
discount rate increasing means increased opportunity in owning bonds but more risk. that's why they see a discount.
My SPY put hedges are the only thing going up, bummer.
Lets drill to 435
Holding off on spy puts iv seen this before when I was on the put side. Ima just sit back and let my 444 calls print into Friday EOD
[deleted]
[SPY ending today at 438 or below is hella bearish.](http://imgur.com/a/X13rEkY) the current resistance trend line on the daily rests around 438 for today. The minor debt ceiling extension into December may be a sell the news event, especially if my TA magical crayons pan out.
Drill team 6 needs to back away asap.
Zoom out on SPY daily chart. Looks like this fellow really got some heavy sand balls...
Why is Tesla moon bound
Imagine selling TSLA to buy DNA üòÇ
So many companies aren't lifetime companies anymore. If you're in one just stay there. This every 5 years bullshit is draining.
We still have a whole ass hour longer of this
Really not seeing a dump here.
How many of you scrubs got blown out of your puts like my roommate?
Something about making Burry cover
Volume is OD low tbh this doesn‚Äôt really inspire confidence
yo thank fuck I read that DD about the RKLB PIPE shit. I was regretting not buying but this shit gonna drill for the rest of the day and tomorrow
Wait, so no 850 EOW??
VIX climbing. Dumpeeeyttt..so I‚Äôm in the clear to load up on calls tomorrow
Making money on calls in the morning and puts in the afternoon. Can‚Äôt beat that
mommy I don't feel so well
Profit taking
HUT looks like it just played Alabama.  Getting run the fuck over
i got xom on monday got blasted, but i also was off on the recent rally by a week so i have bad timing with oil

I found out my bosses make 120k and 170k respectively and we get state pensions up in this bitch so I guess I‚Äôm staying here forever

tsla put is the obvious one
Any TSLA news?
bears getting hard at a 1% vxx increase lolll

Either that or crazy power hour pump
You boys want some hot casino action??????

Lol. Bull trap. Trying to give it all back but the Pre market moves. Wtf?
Forecasting a red day tomorrow, will be purchasing puts
1.569% yield is straight up dogshit. Who cares.

I need some yolo risky plays, who has got some?
Is Tesla truly worth its current value? No. Does Tesla give a fuck? No. $1000 by November.
Oil calls EOD what y'all think mayne? Some XOM or CVX?
Stonk on retail. Let‚Äôs buy them all.
Bulls deserve to lose money
This guy has big balls
Dump ended get ready for the power pump
I don't even have a position in this, so hope it pumps for you homie. üëç
it's a request not a statement
I think we‚Äôd all be more comfortable without that cock in our ass‚Ä¶
Bears you're so fucking silly. This merely a healthy correction before a power hour you're just mad you missed this rocket

This market is rigged.  Closing dump
1.) you should be confident enough that occasionally you have to reassure yourself you are in fact *not* a delusional narcissistic fraud.

2.) Fuck bears
Waiting for Tilray to close at least 5% up ü•∫üôèüèΩ

The green dildos are turning into red dildos
Oh great you just fucking ruined it for everyone
What even is the point of SPY movements right now? lol

Just fall off back to 439. Okay. See you tomorrow.
When did I say that
"Short attack"
wheres this guys hardhat ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Unless the odds of BABA jumping $4-$5 tomorrow somehow is increasing then I‚Äôm probably gonna end up zero‚Äôd out. 

Fun 2 months tho
Stress, anxiety, and depression are all natural feelings our bodies/minds produce to tell us when we‚Äôre fucking up or need to be attentive to some sort of circumstance in our lives (for most people).

Most of the time if you take action to address whatever the root cause is then you‚Äôll find yourself in a better position.

Yes that is your sign to go all in. Ideally look for PE ratios over 200.
Spy 420 still on the table? Historically it‚Äôs a good time of the year for markets and earnings but there‚Äôs still all the supply chain issues and inflation. I‚Äôm not sure which will be more impactful
Can we stop fucking dumping?  PTSD from the past few weeks.
You don‚Äôt know how much is in my bank account.
Trap and dompeet, spy came to early.....
This downward trend started when I sold my 70 spy puts for over 60% loss. Good by 4k I didn‚Äôt need you anyways :(
not yet. bers always way too early, bulls way too late
how absolutely retarded is holding riot $27c expiring tomorrow
How come TLRY gay? Can it just go to $20 real quick?
real move today is in treasuries
Guys, it‚Äôs not bulls vs bears. We‚Äôre all on the same team trying to make money. Stop this idiocy.

420 EOD
Going out like a true yard, bout to double down on these calls
That Tesla spike seems like a bull trap. Didn't the stock drop like 10% the last investor day?
2 days ago it tested resistant 7 SEVEN FUCKING TIMES and broke out. NOW, it doesn't. what the literalllll fuck guys
RIP Joe Rogan and Burry
Nah, phones going crazy today. We selling till 434-436 for sure.
"Go up, you piece of shit!" -Just casually directed at my portfolio as a whole
Hey guys I'm just checking but 10 year yield highest since May is bullish for growth right?
what is my flair supposed to be?
If you own it, sell it.
And just like that this place gets littered with bear shit comming out of the woodwork

May your puts be fucked
Am I in the Truman show? The joke is over now guys very funny
He did lol, he start calling for the crash since like 2012
 Burry is the bomb..
Get one for Oct 20 436
Sonnie, I remember back in my day we'd call shares of Ford "fivers," and you could get one extra if you bought four at a time. You'd say, "Gimmie five, fivers for 20," and nobody would blink an eye, specially if you were wearing an onion on your belt, which was the fashion at the time.
Whatever mod keeps giving people that teddy flair that‚Äôs fucking hilarious
VIX creeping up on us again.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand of course I couldn‚Äôt have one god damn positive day in two months, more losses it is then
You guys want power or sour flavor?
Recession close , 390 open tm
Ngl this ü¶ò market is kinda fun
Now the SPY puts I bought this morning are down 50% instead of 60%
Bulls lmaoooo never gets old
Cockring pull*
you might pay bigly for that
They gonna print bloody ref
End goal: SPY 200 MA but for today spy at 434-436 will do. DND.
not that part. yields going up is a sign of economy improving, and also it is anticipation of taper. so its good in a sense, but its a sign of rate increases coming.
???
What's the spy put before close ?

Oh shit am I about to break even on the puts I bought on the first bump this morning?

Incredibly low volume on this sell off too.

Trading brings a lot of emotions out for people, but for me it‚Äôs made me not look forward to weekends because I can‚Äôt lose money
jfc, yield = annual interest rate/bond price. if bond prices go down, yields go up. bonds and equities inverse each other.
Didn't happen
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
445 top tomorrow, then blood on Monday

Frankly, Michael Burry can fuck off forever with his consistently wrong takes of "the economy is gonna collapse and I'll be right again" 

We get it you were right once over ten years ago shut the fuck up already
Lol. I hope you‚Äôre not naive enough to believe that.
Sold all $TLT puts and 1/2 $F shares
Sorry buls, I just bought calls. Recession back on
yes, i understand what QE is, and the reason why bond prices are so low is because the supply is absurd. yields rising just indicates that bond prices are falling, which is because QE is continuing.
Bring a condom she wants it big time
&gt;When yields rise, that indicates QE is slowing

i can't
False alarm TSLA. Just catching up to the indexes. Was hopeful for a second.
tech green tomorrow !remindme tomorrow

When the financial media refers to yields rising, it is in no way bullish for stocks because it means the discount rate is rising. The opportunity cost of not owning a bond increases.

Correct about first part but QE is literally intensified bond buying. When yields rise, that indicates QE is slowing and the party is trending towards an end.
nah, this is literally how yield is calculated, yield = interest rate/bond price.
Imagine having any imagination left
Looks like it‚Äôs that time to get eod puts expiring Monday and then switch to calls.

SKLZ is such a fucking bitch. Even on a "break out" day it manages to shit the bed
lotta misinformation re: bond yields. bond yields are inversely proportional to bond prices. if yields go up, that's because bond prices are going down. yields going up is BULLISH as it signals rates will continue to remain low and that QE will continue to flow. this whole "oh, yields up are and tech is dying" is a spurious relationship and means that you btfd.

But these big tech names with piles of cash, low and very manageable debt structures, and insane profit margins (for mega-caps) shouldn't flinch at all. 

I just don't see a major headwind for these names, if you're out a few weeks or months out on calls.
Spy closed way above 100dma, now testing 66dma, which is why the pullback.  Once that's broken we only have the 50dma before going to the moon.

Not happening, upwards trend just starting.
Lol K
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Tqqq for the win
Hugely. I'm hoping GOOGL bonerizes bigly. This recent drop was fucking retarded for those two names.
What drop
üÖ±Ô∏èesla üÖ±Ô∏èoner
It‚Äôs called having a high paying job.
see?
This sucks. Maybe i should give up and become a MM
If it says in the 440-442 range by Monday theta will come to you only reason why I‚Äôm telling you this. If we go down tomorrow a bit your gain today will be wiped by a couple %..
Buying calls tomorrow if we dump - holding calls through the storm.
It has to be forced organically.
How are you still financially solvent
Okay so I‚Äôm confused why is everyone acting like spy is drilling when it‚Äôs been sideways all day? Like not even any sizable dips
When does SPY report earnings?
I have been telling the group, we are being rolled in before 405-410 dump.
but more likely the answer to the OP is the MM told their traders "Ok boys we all know this thing is going to shit the bed, you need to trim your holdings and go net short"
Slight pullback for a major comeback
You‚Äôll get there brother we both will to avenge jan 27th .

I believe in you SPY
I bought heavy into DM yesterday.  I know a 6% day is great for a stock return in one day but all I can think is $7.50 calls expiring next week are up 300% today.
Wow that‚Äôs nuts
Lmaoooooooo that retard belongs here

I would like to exercise my 1 time miracle either today or tomorrow, please
Keep loading up those 450c
I had about 40 10/15 450$ spy calls sold them a little early tbh but none the less it was a fire play got in at 0.17$ . The real total was 880 but you get the jist .
# Low volume pump. Only like 3 people are trading.
+1
goddamn this hits home because I am about to take delivery of a new TRD Pro 4runner next week.  would be much farther along on my lift/wheels/mods fund if SPY would have been more cooperative this last month.  Calls were not the move.
Why are you this retarded

I'M SO BORED.
Damnit spy
Ber gang coming out
Oh it's painful, but inversing them always prints
Yeah Altria's a good call because they're a solid company. Even though they're a good bit down. The exposure to whoever it was.. cronos? Idk if I'm wrong on that. Gives them a good foot in the door. But $45 to $55, hopefully(!!), and only hopefully in 2-3 years, is just meh. My real money is in plenty of large cap stuff. But not them, yuck. Surely that 45% of whatever weed company they saved will be good at some point. But I'm after bigger gains in this part of the market that I play around in. That's why Tilray has tuned to #1 on my radar. The whole sector got crushed down. And Tilray is massive now. And they keep crushing it all over the world. Including the U.S. Plus Irwin Simon himself said he wants more. Legalization would only help because of the hurt it would put on our current smaller weed companies here in the U.S. So 45 to 55, meh. I want my average, about $10 after merge and all my purchasing since 12, to just continue the trajectory. Then watch as it forges it's path to $30, $40, $50. This is the way on this one. ‚úå
Waiting to jump back into spy calls
I can't decide if calls or puts. Probably gonna sit this one out and then regret it.
I think since the headlines are over we go back to fundamentals. If earnings are low the market tanks, if they keep rising so does the market. Fed meeting is in November

Yeah market‚Äôs been kinda boring since like 10:30
There‚Äôs a much larger put wall at 35 than call at wall at 40. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here, to maximize profit Options sellers want the price to sit 37ish, that‚Äôs the most likely case for tomorrow‚Äôs price
#$440 support, calls
has it all been, dare I say, PRICED IN?
SPY you whore don‚Äôt you do it
ITS MY FUCKIN CAKE DAY
I've made money today and it feels like I've been kicked in the nuts at the same time, what a day...
Thank God we finally have some price action. Perfect setup for EoD pump. Money flow oversold and MACD divergence been red most of the day. Still think we're finishing with SPX at about +1.5%.
price action is way too strong for that too happen. I mean, I know it could happen, but the likelihood of it happening is slim. There would have to be a major catalyst to be able to break this upward momentum and undo a complete trend reversal  


UNtil then, we're goin up
Only 2 more hours of the cuckery

It‚Äôs so green. Idk what to buy? Any recommendations
Alright bears, what's the next bad news story that made you buy your puts?
Haters are downvoting you
Settle perhaps but they're not going to take a loss. It may be years before it stabilizes. That's like saying ps5 scalpers would be bagholding if supply somehow reached demand, but the reality is they could just return it for the price they paid. Extremely easy to cancel a car preorder.
If you have puts and need them to print just let me know, I can buy calls and start the biggest bear run in history
$250 above $450‚Ä¶ i 100% agree
Got no cash cause smoothtardbrain
We seem to have sprung a leak..

yeah but think of the correction if the world were to become inhabitable....I'd think that would be good for *at least* a 20% drop in SPY

Pro tip: You actually can lose money from spreads. It's a rare thing that happens, but it absolutely can happen, essentially taking your risk-defined strategy and turning it into a massive loss.

Fun fact, scalping exists for the car market now and there are people who are making a living off just pre-ordering new cars and selling them after.

I sense a disturbance in the force
market crash is over, onto new highs now
I well too
Remember me
41 held all day, strong resistance. 10/8 440p will be just enough ITM tomorrow to take gains, wouldn‚Äôt go below that, probably see a bounce off of 37 before moving up again.
I bought puts at ATL, down 90%, sold, then bought calls at ATH, down 25% now
Bruh you can literally get waffle fries at the grocery store, move out of your mom's house already and do some adulting for yourself, you might be surprised what they have out in the real world

yeah, I mean everything is so overpriced I don't thing So Fi is because banks are the last big sectors to not really join the 21st century tech wise. Think about it....Chase of BofA or any of those old school banks are just....OLD. Goldman launched Marcus a colossal failure. I assume every old school bank is eyeing So Fi to eventually buy out.

You ever wonder how PDT rule makes any sense for options? Like stocks I can somewhat understand the reasoning. You want to help little investors by making them hold stocks longer term. Save them from their own impulsive decisions. I get it. 



Options though‚Ä¶.nobody wants to hold options long term lmao. Should be no PDT for options whatsoever

I'd rather just buy an Audi and not be noticed by anyone, and also probably have a nicer feeling car

FWIW I'm not an Audi fanboy, I have a BMW that I never drive, but new bmws get dickrode too hard, I refuse to be seen in one
I had to paperhand my baba calls two days ago. Look what happened today
each of the Star Wars sequels found a new way to not be good or interesting
nah nah man not at all just sayin their chicken is good. I know people refuse to eat it and say its disgusting because they hate the company, but theyve never tried it or they are just too upset to enjoy it. My stomach and taste buds dont give a fuck about feelings.

up $.35 on the day is mooning?
how about u cookie dn m8
The only bull that got rekt is me selling my calls too soon (2 days ago) and missing out on an extra 100% gain
Should I buy my ASTS calls end of day? Or wait till tomorrow hmmm
Funny you say that after SPY rally since the past year lol
I sold today.  I‚Äôll buy again when it drops to $2.   Overvalued right now.
Bigger than yours shitstain
no way. I was thinking even their bank charter announcement wouldn't take it higher than 25
Ah shit‚Äô I knew I was selling my TWLO calls too early when I did in the morning. Left $1000 on the table and I‚Äôm sure it will keep climbing tomorrow and rest of today. üòüüòüüòüüòü

Never wear it, say it fucks up ur swing and ur not used to jewelry on ur body, like a dog who never has been on a leash.  Also say ur scared to lose it.
I think cause most people are expecting a pullback and buying puts - this could go SPY $470 quick af
Taper will happen in November. Jpow basically said it
No one gives a fuck about your üåà CareBear
You are going to be 50k in debt
Jesus you need help
C'mon just a lil more rally today so I can liquidate and head for the hills
Get polynesian sauce
It's basically confirmed for November
I think this green day is people being hopeful and putting on blinders. I never put much stock into the threat of a debt default, Congress needs their historically dependable elderly donors/voters and won‚Äôt risk that. Tapering and China, however, are more credible threats to the market.
Take an IQ test.
and I'll add that TSLA price action is super "range-bound" today. I never see it trade like this. Like scalpers can't scalp today and make money
[deleted]
Give me some dd on the supply chain and inflation shit. Obviously we rallied today cuz hooray America won‚Äôt default but are those other issues still looming?
I'll crush my balls on your face.

SPY volume is only at 40% of daily volume at 1:30‚Ä¶not a great sign

I have nothing to say here about politics of any kind and dont know why folk can mix up characters they see on TV with emotional confusion dislike or flag waving with international economics.. standards of livin, goods, production, trade, finance.. these things do not depend on one or two people .. that's like saying the President of the USA runs wall street. I dont understand that attitude. There is not one country in the world that only trades with itself.. America Europe and Asia are siamese triplets at least.. they like to claim they have  different brains but that's politics - it aint the economics of 2 billion people and counting

Daily reminder that Jim Cramer isn't evil and by hating him you're helping his handlers who manipulate him to alienate himself from online communities like wsb so that he doesn't use the internet era to become self-informed.

Dudes! 
You can still pick up (Shit! Edit!) TLRY $5 calls Jun 20, 2023 for 6.50 each! ü§Ø That's $11.50 total. 11.5 is seriously right around the corner. I got em for around 6.00, which are green like candy now! I vetted so many call options. It's there for the picking!

And after it trying to be pushed down by some crazy red volume, exactly at opening bell! Reality volume coming back with a vengeance. Shorts are F'd. Haha! So anyway, that's one of the long type options I currently kick it with (about 60 total options. Ha)

Oh yeah! Another edit! I was on investor call this morning. First time ever for one! Tilray moved even further out into the lead. Irwin Simon has a small share of MSO. But he wants WAY more. So good to hear. Burners are lighting up!

so my thesis is that bc most market crashes occur on Mondays in October: I want to buy a lot of OTM puts on Fridays in a couple of stocks.

I suppose its true that they don't have to do their job and be responsible about spending the tax dollars....

Oh wait.
When I go to sleep I imagine myself being an NBA player or famous rapper. Make 10k a minute type shit.

AAPL calls baby üöÄüöÄ
Bears already knew they were going to raise the debt ceiling, we did not anticipate McConnell to blink.
yes.. they call it an adjustment and it helps bring down the standard of living "just a little bit"
Big oof, I sold my shit in the AM and just been sitting on hella cash
I gotta a curse that I cannot lift, and it shines in lines as the sunset shifts, with talks of the new moon I wish, gotta bust that box, gotta gut that fish. üåíüî™üê†üçΩÔ∏è

It‚Äôs has a lot of potential but the stock blows and is being shorted to death along with the rest of the lidar sector
$442 on SPY - gotta break through and have a solid follow through day. Until then that‚Äôs the resistance.
What price points are you buying 3 months out?  Atm?  Otm?
There haven't been shares available to short for weeks. Short fee for ones they do find is 170%.

Is SPY getting ready for a breakout? I see a Pennant forming.
good luck finding me in my cave Mr. Sec.
News is it‚Äôs gonna fly eventually but 0 chance market makers let themselves get fucked on all the 17 calls this week.
Which train after this week‚Äôs fake recession will leave da station first
today truly feels like a pump
I‚Äôm already up on puts and I know it‚Äôs gonna crash when it breaks down past 11. Worst case is we have to wait til tomorrow open for it to go back down to sub 11
What‚Äôs the next move boys?
It's only a two month extension, and then we will be right back here. What broke McConnell was probably Manchin telling him either the ceiling gets raised, or the Dems would eliminate the filibuster for debt ceiling raises, which would start the process of removing the filibuster from legislation.
SPY 10 440c 0.43 and 6 437.50c 0.15 10/8
Bought them yesterday right before it ripped from 430 sold them around 441.10. $408 to $5200
be flexible and get calls then. stop being a retard.
‚ÄúPrice is what you pay, value is what you get‚Äù (c) Warren Buffet
prob 10/ The low target is $13 but people will bail if we get to 10
dude, $15 would give me a 50% increase... why wouldn't i want it to jump? Its jumping right now look at the chart. Sorry for celebrating.
Any thoughts on MVIS? I thought it was over valued at $15. Anyone feel like $11 is a fair value or is there a larger correction coming and I should wait to buy?
Russia had a good harvest - USA not so sure.

Confirmed you must be 3x as retarded to buy puts.
why is tesla gay
No you wait 1-2 days for it to pump first then buy puts. But real talk I have a small position in TLRY and might add more. It has fallen hard since its glory days, I don‚Äôt see it going below 10. Will definitely set a stop loss this time around if it does run.
Do not FOMO into thinking a past meme stock is going to explode again. I‚Äôve lost so much money doing so
Done deal
It's sad seeing how many people still post aboot meme stocks that already pumped and dumped months ago.
Nice try, xi
I feel you, same thought on SKILZ :( The chart of those both look similar also

Short-term ATH for EoM expire and 2178 for EoM expire.   
Longer term 1900 for January   
I think we're in a really great entry level for the RUT now.

AAPL give me that post lunch nut
I wish there was a 4x or 5x leverage etf
Depends if you were cash and bought in today at 9:30 or if you were long and holding overnight. P much everything hit a daily max or near it at 10 today
Ceiling talks going great!
Well just logged in and discovered my put lost 95% value. Lucky only small position! I really did expect McConnell to have something unacceptable tied to the delay. Hard to believe Biden's CEO get together broke his iron will.
im resisting the urge to buy when its green because i been buying high selling low this whole year
Poor Remy has to live with your bad decisions
Im even but expected them to go green today like the rest of my shares ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
It appears ive once again severely overestimated my intelligence
Np. RH will not allow you to naked sell a options contract. Meaning you cant sell an options contract with out first having one. In the options section, you have Buy and sell. If you are doing this from your phone you can hit select at the top and then select your contracts. 

Generally speaking you will be looking to sell a options contract with a farther out of the money strike price than the options contract you currently hold. When you sell a contract you are given a premium. To close a sell options contract, for example if you are not holding till expiry, you would pay back the premium listed.

Your total profit will be the difference in the strike prices.

For calendar spreads you would sell a strike closer to the expiry, and then by a further dated option, at or above the current strike. Thus you will create a Debit Calendar spread.

When TLRY hits 11, it‚Äôs gonna fall hard
As a guy whose profile is 20% Tilray, I can tell you first hand that this stock is garbage and owning it feels like owning a boat that's slowly sinking.
I fell for this shit 6/6 times. Don‚Äôt buy stocks today. Tomorrow nasdaq and spy will go - .5% after hours and -1.2% intraday. 

Happened to me literally 6/6 days
Nothing. Just a normal chart pattern. Sometimes stocks start strong and drift down all day
This looks like a bull flag and it‚Äôs pissing me off

Guesses for TLRY price at opening tomorrow? I'm gonna say $12.17 and then ride that momentum into 15-16 by the end of the week.
Yup. Most movement with futures or pre-market.  Retail always late. This is why I don‚Äôt buy options or do short term usually
[deleted]
We gonna make TLRY a meme stock again?
Right? What investor is going, "you know which tech stock I want to buy more than any other today? Facebook."
Yes this is the thing for me personally. Look at an SPY chart for the past week. The moves up or down are almost vertical. The volatility is kinda insane. When there‚Äôs selling it‚Äôs ‚Äúsell this idc how much of a loss I take‚Äù. When there‚Äôs buying it‚Äôs ‚Äúget me this and idc how much I overpay for it‚Äù. Idk. There‚Äôs like this weird chaos to the volatility. Everyone sells the second they think someone else might sell, then the FOMO when things turn green sends the chart vertical (again, I didn‚Äôt say it just ‚Äúgoes up‚Äù, I said the movement is damn near vertical). For a moron like me, that tells me that really no one knows what things are supposed to be - they just don‚Äôt wanna get burned to the downside, and don‚Äôt wanna miss the upside. The speculative fever I feel has to be at an all time high just by looking at the chart

wait so when theres good news that means bearish right? and bad news is bullish?

Puts but sell at 37
I Predict CLOV Yolo's to fill up the forum end of day today/tomorrow
What is going on with Sofi? Any news
AMD fd puts?
Deloitte partnership today is bullish. But over the next month they‚Äôve said they are releasing the beta version of BB Ivy and releasing the details of patent sale no later than end of November. It‚Äôs also fallen about 15+% since it‚Äôs earnings and is in the single digits again. So I expect a bounce even with no news, and if these PR‚Äôs come out it could truly meme hard

AMD flying too high. It's been green for the past 3 days or so and it was up as high as 4% today. 4% is huge for AMD. It's probably going to end up up 2.5 to 3% today and will probably pullback tomorrow.

lol buy puts. everyonethinks SOFI will shoot to 20 after the bank charter is approved, but failing to realize that bank charter is already priced in at this point. its pretty much gauranteed at this point.

this thing will go up maybe a dollar or two max, then once approval comes crash back down to 15.

that fucking stock SOFI GOAT on youtube is scamming millions for investors saying this thing has a "50% upSIDE after the charter" and will hit 45 by end of next year. such a bullshit call its not even funny.

even if they hit their revenue projections next year, this thing will top out at 20 MAX. it has perfection priced in.

I'm buying the dip on Chinese as the narrative is definitely changing, but my gut feeling is that when their market opens tomorrow, there will be another selloff and another buying opportunity.

LOL I KNOW
Banks just slashed all their Q3 forecasts
Spy put prices are too damn high
I thought = IMO = China would start moving soon (last week I said "over the next two weeks") - and it *looks* as though that's started happening .. still early days and tomorrow might be as bad as yesterday, but I beleive there is an international DELIBERATE economic path being laid down and discussions decisions and instructions spreading across Asia (or out from there) through the major centers.. all the way through to the west, for sure.

for me this is interesting - if I was setting policy Id focus on economics and trade and fuck nationality,  totally...

Check out **Cliodynamics** if anyone gets an urge to look it up,it's an interesting way of looking at stuff (it aint no cult religion for sure:) .. - it wont make you profit the same way as a meme can gain you 10% in a day, but memes are totally part of it, and so are "gut feelings" just as much as the Fed announcements, or economic reports from Deutsche Bank or TV bullshit .. And I aint selling anything. I'm just saying "something going down" You don't feel it at all?

I just have a feeling it's time to scrap being financially "anti Chinese" (because there is a lot of that around aint there? - for some strange ECONOMIC reason, it's a standard WSB joke, right?), screw that and start looking at what is going to be profitable and how governments as well as companies are adjusting right now. Change happening.

Because **the world changed last month** (wtf why, you tell me?  make up your own narrative), the market floors changed, the **feeling** changed, .. maybe 3-5 weeks ago or so? - and now we aint on the same planet.

My GUESS is all the DD you did up to now - **scrap it** and start doing it agan from scratch. Do yourself a favor.

that's what I'm doing, and if Im 100% wrong it aint no skin off your nose, right? - Ive been wrong before.

have a nice day.  checkout some new processes maybe.

Spy‚Äôs gonna rocket powerhour
I took my gains and ran. Reloaded more yesterday at like 9.65 then i read more of the short report and some of the stuff was no bueno, even if ginkgo was pretty up and up on biz model.

I'll wait for a response before I decide further on actually investing long term into this one. Was pretty long on this. Ah well can't complain about the short term gains from previous pump to $14+ and today's bounce from yesterdays low.
It‚Äôs someone posting an emoji. I think they only show up when using a phone app
as I was told before the news doesnt matter
Discovering options gotta be top 3 worst things ever to happen to me
That's what volatility brings.
\*SPY drops 0.05% after going up 1.4%\* Bears: It's about to get bumpy time to cash out!!!
I am looking for people who were couple of months ago shouting $BB is my baby, $SPCE to the moon, $SKLZ rlz etc.   
Where are you now? What's your play?
Scam stocks mostly up today. The hope they need, not deserve
Imagine being the guy that bought leaps when it was 300
Just log out and you no longer have to pay what you owe. Debt free
Calls on what?
Come on spy go back up, show me some $
Eh at least they didn't lose money.  People were buying puts at $430 saying they "felt a correction coming soon" because they apparently believe it only counts as a correction when you drop more than 5% in a single day or something.
Despite everything in my portfolio being up , I‚Äôm still down over the week by a decent bit.
This is attritional warfare
Should I believe Van Bryan and his single biggest financial event since 1602 with his #1 quadrillion cap stock pick?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Disagree. It moved too quickly but not sure I'd call it overbought at these levels. SPY and QQQ are still off their highs by a good amount.
AZN chart = SPY chart

Change my mind
Are we already in the next economic downfall, the biggest in history?
32k online during a big gap up in SPY

Only 5-8k more to go and we‚Äôll be back to pre-cult numbers.

Which means the good DD will make it through all the dipshit friendship/hive mind posts they all spam since they like being friends more than they give a fuck about making money.

Future is looking bright

SPY Strangles - jobs report tomorrow -
Why do we ‚Äúneed‚Äù to break above 442 or 443. We can even end the day at 439 where it started like who cares, it will still be up over 1%.

Also the Fed: Did someone say zero interest rates and free money??? Don't mind if I do!

Also, Later, the Fed: What's that? No more free money? Don't mind if I sell!  
Also, Later, the Fed: Some of our dudes are going to have to um, \[cough\] ... retire.

TA can give you a likelihood of something happening. Unfortunately for people that trade exclusively on that, emotions are way stronger factor in moving the market lmao.
SPY is just waiting for all the bears to deposit the money they stole from their moms purse to buy puts before it goes on another rip.
Whelp. Puts until December when they pass the debt ceiling. After furloughing fed employees for 2 weeks right before Christmas.
Dec is a long ways off, there will be a pump
I sure am, cannot wait for the bear rug pull that started mid day on Monday to fully come about. all time highs by Monday

Accidentally bought spy calls right after selling, no more day trades.

I hate robinhood
Fucking crazy every dip being bought ASAP
Take a look at the crossover on the charts. It's finally starting to trend back upward. It's only like a 4% gain to get there and your putting down 26 bucks to make 220. Seems like a decent play

Haha. I'm only 1k off my all time high and I am de leveraged to the point of safety.
DNA is really running now. Cathie Wood owns like half the tradeable float. Hmm...
Volume has dried up to being non-existant. QQQ bumping against a $365 wall all morning. Either we break and further pop tomorrow or bleed back down a bit to close the week.  


What does WSB think will happen? My gut is we bleed back down a bit unless a major piece of news happens
Just follow Paul Pelosi's trades.
Are we all in SPY $450 calls?
Knowing this market that bull flag on spy is bearish lol.
Nah im too retarded for that
DNA has recovered almost completely from the short report thanks to Cathie Wood buying a huge amount on the dip. Thing is, the short report is pretty damning, showing that most of the revenue is fake, coming from companies with that DNA actually set up and runs out of its own offices. It's paying itself. Historically, Cathie Wood refusing to admit she was wrong has not held up well for e.g. NNDM, SPCE, ACHR. Puts on this thing, like December or January expiration, seem really good right now.
they're about to snuggle up for the winter didnt you see Otis reclaim the illustrious fat bear crown?

AMD has gained 1400% over the past 5 years.  SPY 104%.   If your shares go down on fundamentally strong companies then you just wait for them to go back up.  Your whole support for puts was that a fundamentally strong company would go back up.

These dude's are definitely starting the burners to take off and start climbing out of holding pattern!

Edit.. Get in while it's still in the 11-12 range. The longer you hold the better your returns are gonna be! I was watching volume and on the call. I totally snuck in a shitload of shares as it dipped cause of the morning manipulation. Awesome pickup! Whoever that was.. Thank you!

Thanks but I prefer losing money, not earning it
If serious, ban
In a state of heightened confusion, he does both of his options, resulting in fucking chaos
I have 10/15 puts I got today too
Why did baba pump
$BABA BOOEY ü§ëü§ëü§ë
Chinese stonks printing today
Gainesville
What the freaking heck is baba doing
Baba $150 10/8 puts loaded
It‚Äôs all about guidance. We have serious supply chain issues that will remain in place through Q2 at the least.
That reminds me, gotta set an alert for /MES &gt;4444.
The bull run continues üìàüÜô‚òùÔ∏è

Stay in the market and get rich üí≤üí∞ü§ë
WEN is here for you
The single sacrificial spy put I bought is down 95% and I couldn‚Äôt be happier because I know for a fact that if I had only bought calls the market would have tanked. You‚Äôre all welcome. Well, not you, bers, you‚Äôre fuk.
$SAVA touching green. That is something I suppose.
DNA puts. RKLB puts.
I bought puts and calls. IDK anymore.
Why would SPY be red tomorrow? All news is pointing up. No reason for it to go down (maybe EOD dump). FUD from the bears is annoying
[deleted]
Watch the 10yr go up, fed taper, supply stretched through Q4... Gonna be a slow descent or continued rise with a crash.
think the bears are tweezering their tiny cocks while they downvote everyone in the thread?
450c yolo for tomorrow????
7/15/22: SPY at 135.48 after 12 consecutive red trading days, has been in strong downtrend for months. up 0.54% today.

**BEARS LMFAOOOOOOOO**
I‚Äôm going back to buying corn futures
AMD ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I‚Äôm thinking dump and I am betting on it.
Yeah. US default is a total sham.
YINN puts or YANG calls?
I need some quick plays please..
EOD? Flat AF, but with slightly more price action. Pump happened in the AM this time.
$AMD- Time to short.
He said everything bubble
If the stock market did crash 20% would the fed jump right back in to prop it up again? Is there any situation where the fed wouldn‚Äôt jump in to stop a stock market crash
Because that would sound like I'm speaking outta my ass
People here can‚Äôt handle that TLRY is back in a downtrend!
Have you seen the market 1 year ago vs now? You ok lmfao?
The moment debt ceiling gets published there‚Äôs gonna be so much fomo $ pumping into spy. Most people don‚Äôt follow the market closely.
China has tasted the forbidden fruits of capitarism and can never go back.
Heyyyyy my tlry weeklies died. Thought I would be rich. WTF.
Loading up on DNA puts
Today is reminding me of this past Tuesday. Gonna dick around 441 until 3:30 and then dump to 439ish at close
gotta empty all your piss bottles
probly afternoon pump
Tlry is usually trash. Cash now before it goes down
So many bears bout to get annihilated
That's kind of you. Holiday earnings are gonna be interesting this year.
Why not tomorrow?
Hey checking up on bears, how are you guys doing?
Damn I love NVDA best stonk for CCs‚Ä¶
Not at this rate
Lol thanks,, what city ? Sheesh
Nope! I was on investor call this morning. Hit and passed multiple goals. EBITDA continuing to move higher. 10th time in a row!
Remember to post your spy 450c loss porn
Any juice left in TLRY left? Or that‚Äôs all the action we got
Yes
Edit: no
Banana hammock
BBBY looking BBBYeautiful for a nice squeeze. Loaded the fuck up on calls
Wendy‚Äôs?
Yet.
[deleted]
Up 50% on RBLX calls. Shit is taking off
Tell me about it! Shhhesh
Straddle?
Uh...what? Figure out a stock's floor and sell a put at the floor's strike price. 

If you had the money for example, an AMD cash secured put at $100 strike would be easy money whether its exercised or not. AMD will rebound above $100 easily even if the stock drops below that value temporarily.

Cash secured puts are awesome for theta and just as good for stock you believe in long term.
If not by EOD
hard to ignore
Someone call Al Gore; the bears are going extinct.
It's my first üß∏ in weeks and it feels bad
four what?
Can‚Äôt wait for BABA to get slaughtered overnight. Will prolly give up half these gainz by EOD
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm banking on.  eod at the latest.
Dry aged rib eye and a mid tier wine
Calandar spreads are hilarious. The stock doesn't even have to move and your portfolio goes from +$1000 to  -$1000 then back up $1200. Not for the weak hearted lol
Time for 436p??
Bro they don‚Äôt even sell it, it just gets stolen.

I‚Äôm walking a dog on a trail that has homes and backyards on both sides of the trail and there was straight up just an 8 point buck hopping from the trail and into some dudes backyard 

So if you‚Äôre reading this and live alongside a trail make sure there‚Äôs not a deer in your backyard now
BABA will print, auto industry is a tough biz so idk about NIO.
Remember WEN
you stupid bull still got money left?
It‚Äôs also theta Friday
AMD hitting 112 next week
Retail bears who short gappers, I don‚Äôt know who you are, but bless your heart and thank you for the gains
Did you have WEN for lunch?
being a bull is the dumbest thing u can do rest of the year
How does that company still exist?
It‚Äôs ok we can still afford WEN
Been that way for about 4 weeks.  If folks haven‚Äôt recognized that than they are missing out.
I'm cash waiting until after taper tantrums this fall
Thank you for not pinning the popular tickers thread. Shits embarassing

ford essentially went up $1 in a striaght line and i held my puts the entire time.
Does WEN sell weenies yet?
Is spy gonna slip or what...
What does everyone think about NIO and BABA leaps?
#player 441 eliminated
Yes they signed some deal I think. It's possible it becomes a real company which would be hilarious.

Trevor is my idol BTW, gotta respect a grifter.
the f you talking about, we here
I think most think it'll go down... and that should give you an idea on how to play it.
I spy something erect
You could easily be right.  I didn‚Äôt go big on tomorrow‚Äôs puts.
Who the FUCK is Dow Jones
Is Burry calling for a market wide crash? I thought he was only exceptionally bearish on Tesla and other overpriced growth trash. I'd buy puts on ARKK or something if you want to follow in his footsteps.
It makes a big difference when people actually want our help
I promise to not engage in retardation anymore Sir.
still am lol, just glad I broke even
We can dream, brother.
Worth learning about politics. There was never a fucking chance of the US defaulting , and if you understand that you could dump your life savings into calls
Don‚Äôt miss the WEN train this time
Cool, see you Tuesday.

10yr action suggests more volatility coming
Moment of silence for everyone who probably went in on SPY 420P and lower 2 weeks ago
He doesn‚Äôt care for you either
...and the bears are silent
WEN only goes up
Tell him that u gotta stay home since ur wife's boyfriend is coming and u wanna watch when they are having sex
I‚Äôm getting DP‚Äôed by this lack of movement from SPY.
Earnings coming up - should be good no?
I miss a rational market.
Expiration on those puts u bought? Short term or longer
So I don't know since when I'm unbanned but thanks to the mod who did it.

I hope this was not by accident lmao
Days like these I like super oom 5 DTE spy puts for like $15 just for the fun of it

Looking for a -10 bagger at this point. Maybe if I invert me‚Ä¶
-5% a month is better pay than wendys
The $2 an hr tipped wage is really obscene in terms of inflation.  Let just pass those wages along to our customers then....

Unless you have a boss who will actually ask for details. Like a psycho who would ask for a receipt or some shit.

Reversion to the retard
Sold out of my spy calls and into puts.   This is a different market than 2 months ago.   Don‚Äôt get caught holding your calls too long.

Debt ceiling semi out of the way is nice news for markets even though it was never an issue imo.  But still lot of hurdles in this bearish trending market.
The only way I can cum anymore, is if I close my eyes and picture JPow saying ‚Äúinflation is transitory‚Äù
WEN menu?
as of when i posted, yes. and as of now, yes, the very top. i'm happy with what i made, i'm not getting greedy. do i think there's more money to be made? sure. am i happy with what I took? absolutely, and i'll take those profits every day of the week

Finger banging puts at 41.50 all day.
I eat WEN by green candlelight
Yes we are. Mitch fixed it
Shares and options my end. I just have my wife buy and hold stuff. She's been on since aphria was 2 bucks. Even cashed out some profits when that was happening. So she way good still. 
I have about 50 options total. Plus almost 4k shares now after today's wackiness at opening time. Which was super helpful for me!
work sucks!
Ok but it‚Äôs not at 450 lol
Because the pay is shit

Well, at least the Chinese will be able to pick up 80 billion in military surplus for cheap!
In fairness‚Ä¶ I think Taiwanese soldiers would fight Gyna to the death
yeah, id say buy the pull backs, but dont bet on them happening, youll get bit more than its worth on oil right now.
Wack ass volume
The Afghan army is loaded with lazy drug addicts. I've seen it first hand, there was no way they were gonna be able to defend shit. Sad reality.
I've seen this SPY chart somewhere before...just can't put my finger on it.
Premium is not comparable to calls. Puts are more expensive .If you don't foresee a stock moving down or up you can make good money selling Puts. I wouldn't recommend buying them though.
Where‚Äôs the guy from last night that commented AMD was setting up to hit $108 by Friday? What a call.
This isn‚Äôt 2020
If I had a penny for every time someone said this...
Taiwanese people are more ideologically in line with the US than Afghans
Anyone member when AMD ran up like 60% in a month last year? Yea if it could repeat that that would be great
I sold 3 calls so far, I got 20-30 of em left. I'm playing the long game in general
Ight so green for a couple more days we fill that gap then right back down? Idk mate, pump is sus to me still
Why arent Americans working ü§îü§îü§î

Nah. Market is riding on JPows magic carpet.
last chance to buy TLRY before moonshot
Yeah, missed that one, good call.  Ill join ya next week when it drops to 100 again, just send me a reminder.
I‚Äôm holding 5k of TQQQ at 117 idk if wanna hold much longer tho lol

Good deal thanks
Blame FSLY
Guess $445 will have to wait until next week
Not in the U.S.
AMD is printing me so much fucking money
Yes cuz the last time we trained people to defend themselves it went so well
I'm glad I woke up late. If not, I'd probably have sold a few BABA calls way too early, at opening bell, to survive
ASML is about to make me act up. Someone persuade me not to buy slightly OTM leaps please
Now that I woke up to -90% on my puts, and I‚Äôm ready to switch to calls, you bulls may want to inverse me and buy some puts.
TQQQ bro bro bro

You're about to be up $20k when we hit 110 EOD
SKLZ low price target was like $15 and a high of 22 and it only just got back over 9. Think about it.
I think Josh Brown just sounded a bit bearish for first time

Thanks for adding the England version for all of the wankers lurking around (tools in US)
Ya I bought in like 2 days ago so I‚Äôm happy
I'd hold that. Not sure if we go back to ATH without the debt ceiling being finalized, which could take a couple weeks. If the past 2 years has taught me anything is debt and borrowing drive the market more than anything.
Sitting on a yacht eating shrimp
im in on CCXi but i sold calls....
I have many types of BABA calls. Some are old calls with near-expiry and have bad target prices, like Nov $190.
Yes 170. At a slight loss right now but feeling confident long term. Been buying since 180 but I wish I was a bit more patient and bought more below 150.
nope, just give it a week or so
I am super gay
Paper handed bitches.

Im diamond handing these calls to vahalla.

Assuming legalization happens the LPs will move too. Many of them are well positioned and waiting in the sidelines as well as other countries in Europe. When it‚Äôs go time they will all go ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
Who else held calls durning the mini dip
Retarded. Ok.
Everything about puts is fuk

Premiums on puts are directly comparable to calls but the chance of calls hitting is substantially greater.  Especially long dated calls.

Selling secured puts otm requires you to have cash "Cash covered puts" and when you are forced to cover it is a losing proposition all around because you ended up getting a tanking stock.

Selling Covered Calls otm means the worst thing that happens is you need to sell a stock for gains and get a premium.

Puts are only really good if you have strong conviction of something going down soon.  Otherwise it is just a case of "Timing the market".  The bottom this time was $427 which was an all time high 3 months ago.

Q: If you could go back in time to prevent something bad from happening, when and where would you go?

Most peoples answers: "I'd go back to the 1900s and kill baby hitler"

My answer: "I'd go back to 10 am on 10/7/2021 and stop myself from selling my calls for a 100% gain then immediately parlaying my entire account into spy puts"

You can find a bear and bull case for any stock you want on there. It's just for media consumption and reinforcing what you want to happen.
Do people still get pantsed? If not we need to bring it back, classic funny. Might have to get a boomer or two at the grocery store.

I blame the dems for not pushing through legalization during this one small window when they control both legislative branches and the executive branch. We won‚Äôt have a chance like this again for a long time.

Ran straight into resistance and failed. The party is over
You guys are really brave to buy calls or puts EOD. That is real gambling you have 18 hours in which literally anything can happen. It takes big balls to do that. Smol PP, but big bols.
The big plays always lose. The little ones always win. That's why I'm a successful trader who loses money.

The lesson is to be flexible. All you did was switch directions; you're still unidirectional.
I rode puts earlier in the week, hopped into calls yesterday, then sold and re-entered on a shorter dated play. It rebounded well, looked like it wanted to go above $16.90, then just wacked back down. Really frustrating to watch lol

442 is lava
After my calls went to 0, baba up 10%. After i switched to memes from spy, spy up $6. Fuck

441 resistance is super strong. Not sure if I sell on the next bounce off or try to ride it. 10/15 calls so I have time but spy goes down so dummy fast
i'm not making any moves, but if i was a gambler i'd said to see if we get another big green day on Friday, then buy qqq puts dated a month out if we do.

Funny you mention AMD+NVDA, I swing between those two and AAPL pretty routinely. Tend to swing AMD the most and will hold NVDA calls for a few days since price action seems less volatile with NVDA

I don't think so. All that downward pressure of volume was exactly at opening bell. It was definitely BIG money manipulating. But normal volume is killing it and bringing back. And Irwin Simon, the CEO (just got off investor call), is fuckin crushing it.

I cant believe baba is up $14. After my calls went to 0.
I‚Äôm looking to get 7-10% out of it by EOY
Profiting on a position, selling it, and then transferring the profit to your bank account is as satisfying as growing and eating your own food. It's homegrown, organic money.

Bought 9k of PUTs earlier, down about 20%
Yeah and it will be handled by the CCP. Not even an issue in China. Economic and financial stability is number 1.
Fuck Weiss he needs to die
first time? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
I need stonk ideas
Ever actively root against your own position just so someone here will lose and shut the fuck up?

lol suck me downvoting bots
We're just going to give Taiwan lots of guns and missiles and let China make that mistake if they want to. Even if China wins they will fucked economically and diplomatically. Xi talks a big game but he knows it would be stupid to invade.
Heads or tails
But how much
Wasnt dumb enough to but 1DTE calls I'm 1 to 2 weeks out close to ITM and they're already printing
nothingburger? lol they still aint paying US *dollar bonds, and now there's more developers who aren't either
You definitely belong here
Did it go to 10.50?
i want to buy spy calls but i already missed out on this 2 day run, shits aleady up a lot today
all the more reason to buy stocks and equities tho
If you are bullish short term, then yes this low IV environment is optimal. However the long dated calls were not affected much.
if we can get one more pump day i might sell
I owned it from $120 and got out at $150 and I had about $200k in it so I know the stock well.  Go look at historical data, AAPL usually slumps after earnings, even when they destroy it.  AAPL has basically turned into a high yield place to park your cash.  Dont get me wrong, I love the company and Ill be back in it as soon as I've made my easier money in other places.  Right now I'm making more in $AMD + $NVDA in 1 week than I typically would in $AAPL in 6 months.
Greedy baka
F
thinking fb calls were a match with qqq puts ü§°
Who know, price action is decent tho, healthy pullbacks with each gap up, not behaving like a meme thank God
No.
Yep, pretty much free money at this point.

stop loss already put in place
Haha this is some fake life bullshit. Inflation is out of control for daily items, supply chain issues, pandemic raging
Lmao everyone playing tlry earnings learned the hard way about iv crush. Better luck next time
TLRY will go up more and possible to 16 next month
Sell the debt ceiling news.  Rates increasing.
hows the liquidity?
Guys I'm scared, I'm making money so the world is ending tomorrow.
TLRY moonshot coming soon
got in on some MRNA, shit is printing, I need Stephen Weiss to shill the fuck out of it
$40 bag holders probably
Not worth it bro honestly, and this is coming from someone who would love for baba to go to new lows so I can DCA further
Priced in, most FUD was from the debt ceiling which was retarded and will be resolved today. Green all this week and next.
Or train your dog maybe?
[deleted]
Yup will end red eod üòÇ
TLRY consolidating at 11.20 before the next gap up to 11.50 get your calls now
We basically already are but it‚Äôs happening online for now
Saving up for my dream home. Probably take another year for the down payment

Puts for tomorrow. Not a prediction, the truth
Fuck TSLA. That shit been nothing but barcode lately and just trapping traders all day long.
That was the quickest correction in market history

Looks like the gay bears are going into hibernation.
Wait until it turns into 5k again
My pp moved
I just bought some baba calls. Feel like it will explode again soon
because we bought the god damn dip
[deleted]
I held my puts through 428 yesterday I deserve to perish from my greed forgive me bear lord I have failed you
Specifically talking about the mergers/acquisitions and setting up to be ready to jump at American legalization. The TLRY management wasn‚Äôt great, but they merged with Aphria which was notorious for smart management, TLRY today is basically Aphria in all but name don‚Äôt take my word for it, look it up.

Green as far as the eye can see
Why BB?
Go back to sleep
Sure you do you buddy.
1 DTE BABA puts?
Making losses back but still losing. It's a way of life.
I know, what absolute horror lol. Nothing is scarier to crooked Wall Street than the consumer being protected tbh
need congress to say we‚Äôre using AFRM buy now play later for the debt ceiling of these calls are gonna be worthless
anyone have any actual reasons that the market went up overnight??
All, check out my beautiful lil' boy SOXL.  

Love scalping FDs on SOXL after a dip and you get the big 6-9% days right after.
Wait so wtf happened with the whole Evergrande FUD? Never materialized? Are we past it already?
not a chance we dump from here. fuckin retard strength
Taiwan number one
Dip buyers getting tired

Nah I‚Äôll trim some maybe when it‚Äôs overvalued again , until then I‚Äôm not selling shit only buying more

i'm actually personally not bullish on the hard seltzers (i am however bullish on la croix and perrier and whatnot)

i work for a budweiser distributor and the hard seltzer market is not growing like it was a couple of years ago. both too saturated and not as on trend anymore
If you don‚Äôt know just stay out tbh

Afternoon pump soon bears no where to be found.
im going to buy some 10/8 430 puts because they're cheap and I'm a filthy gay bear
I did the same with my upst call yesterday bought it back higher and made my losses back tho
Jack ma BABa balls
Do you mean that we suffer from short-term memory loss? Because yes, we do all have short term memories, even those outside of WSB.
This right there. Majority of users would be making more money by putting them aside and not fucking trading.
TLRY acting predictable. Dumps .20 then shoots up .40. Gonna happen several times today.
Buying 15 pre rolls to chain smoke blunts till tlry hits 20.

Either that happens or i just forget and move on to a better activity
Yes, let's cheer CHPT.
Everyone knew the debt ceiling was gonna pass. How many wanna see a sell the news event as soon as it‚Äôs dropped? I think bulls get fucked if they stick around tim long. My last calls were flipped this morning. Scaling into some calendar put spreads.
NIO breaking out of a massive falling wedge rn, calls for tomorrow
BABA has been going up in US markets outsized and out of correlation with Hang Seng since China markets have been closed. Prior to last night BABA and other ADRs were down 5-7% on the week in Hong Kong while being up 5% in US. Last night they played catch up and now we have this going on. Perfect opportunity for them to get nuked overnight when HK &amp; China are blood red with everyone expecting them to be up massively again. When's the last time Hang Seng has put up a 3% day with more upside? Take your gains.
I need FFIE to go up more than 9$/share by tomorrow.

FFIE is heavily shorted and has very high stock borrow fee.
Man that thinking fuck me so many times
Is this place still full of GME-Qanon-greatundoingofthefinancialsystem cultists?
SPY ran out of steam
Guys let‚Äôs extrapolate the SPY top with the debt ceiling increase today. Since spy is 441 dollars per share and every dollar represents a billion dollars and the debt ceiling increases by 480 billion dollars, we can safely assume that the top for spy is 921 dollars through simply adding 480 to 441.

Godbless America I hope everyone makes money today

When China invades Taiwan and the US goes to war with them all BABA holders will be sent to internment camps

Mmm, quite.

The stock market is in casino mode today. Euphoria is the last stage of a bull market. Buying puts rn.
Tilray ER with a 43% increase in revenue ... ok I‚Äôm in !
Imagine believing in free market
Popeyes before bed means high volatility on open.
Lmao!! Imagine buying calls for 50 dollars while i grabbed it for 10 dollars this morning
Feel like donating today, loaded up on 10/8 430p‚Äôs.
I have zero doubts about baba in the long run, I sleep like a baby holding it. Never selling unless I have to tbh, I‚Äôll be able to live off the dividends they will have in the future when they are no longer in high growth mode and just normal growth
Careful with AAPL.  Long term it's gonna go up but short term, there arent any catalysts to drive the stock price higher in the short term.  It'll go up a percent or two but there's easier money to be made with the same level of quality.
Idk how Will Meade isn't the richest person on earth yet. He can literally tweet any low volume pump n dump stock with options and instantly make 100% of his money. And it works for his moronic followers every fuckin time
You think that mainland Chinese media does not talk about Evergrande because it isn't relevant to US banks? TIL mainland chinese media target is Americans.

obviously total specualtion but im thinking more and more facebook caused the outage on purpose. Their statement said something like "we're sorry it went out, we know how you all depend so much on facebook." and then there was a whole bunch of opinion articles that came out from various sources where ppl talked about how the outage made them realize how much they missed facebook...
Smells like poor people in here
I sold my TLRY calls for a 50% loss this morning. AMA
I‚Äôm loaded to the tits
TLRY what a fucking ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4272)
I sold my calls earlier at 212+. Will buy back later, probably Friday or Monday.
I didn‚Äôt giver her my number, my buddies girlfriend did..

Damn, bought 441 calls at open to make a quick buck but totally forgot I had made three day trades already after I went to sell them at around a 50% gain. Guess I‚Äôm holding these till tomorrow :/
Where is all the DD üò°
Lol, it's moved a dollar
TLRY IV is still low. FDs here i come ü•µ
If TLRY can pump with only 170M in sales then WISH should be damn near 10billion market cap
Bounce and go higher!
That‚Äôs a 5 year set and forget stock man, check back once every 4 months
i completely agree
Imagine buying $9 puts on TLRY this morning. Lmao
Bullish on seltzer
If 441 support turns into resistance bulls r fuk
LETS FUCKIN GOOOOOOO!!!!
Are candles the same thing as dildos?

I‚Äôve somehow managed to be perfectly even through all the swings of this week. No clue what I‚Äôm doing. 

But at least I‚Äôm not losing money? I guess?
Oh no we lost 441 whatever will we do!!! üòÇüêÇ
What‚Äôs the deal with that energy stock?
BABA SHEEESHH
They make money off of theta decay(value that an option loses everyday)

Ty
We have such short term memories.
I know you‚Äôre joking, but if people just invested and not gambled on options, they would be in good shape. I was able to buy my house because I saved and invested. I don‚Äôt make enough money to just not find other ways to make $
Hopefully BABA keeps this momentum. Most undervalued stock on the market.
its got the look
TLRY finally correcting to what its really worth. This earnings report correction is the best thing to happen. Got people actually looking at it.
SPY YOU BEAUTIFUL SLUT!!!!
My dog dug a hole in my couch cushion and the upholstery/repair place near me said that foam shortages were so bad in their sector I was probably better off buying a new couch. $700 for a cushion.  ü§£

I need to buy a couch that is dig proof.  That was some solid loss porn.
I don't know why bears are complaining. They had their good 2 weeks this year. They will again next September.
Lol people cheering about TLRY. Let me know when this stupid stock goes over 20 dollars so i can get the fuck off‚Ä¶.
Plus she looks like the villain from The Mask
the whole thing was extremely bizarre. not to mention the outage happening at the same time, and the whole thing during a tech correction. I'm not knowledgeable enough to know what's really going on bt that was suspicious af.

Told you that the market would start rallying once enough of you have bought puts.
It‚Äôs still basically at its floor. Low risk at this point.
isnt that a good buy point
Haven't done those in like 10 years. Was a good time, but I don't think I'd want to get back into it.
They are heading to wendys rn
TLRY to the mooooooon üçÅüöÄüåù
Spy you so crazy!
Block the number? In the future, set up a cheap burner number you can give out, and when you are done with it, kill it and get a new one.
Imagine not playing earnings on TLRY after that 30%
That would be nice but dont get your hopes up
who else is in nvda

Only put about 10% of my portfolio towards it so I held on. Happy I did but of course kicking myself for not allocating more.

Gambling on TLRY since another ape told me to.
My buddies girlfriend gave her my number, I had no clue. Kinda fucked up
This is just a classic bounce off the 69 day moving average
That huge rally up only had 3 5 minute candles in a row. We just had 5 red ones in a row
You're high if you think TLRY is going to shoot up and give you easy money.

Upvote is you think Facebook is going up today/tomorrow and downvote if you think it‚Äôs going down still
Dude I bought that fuckin dip and we are still gapping up
There's easier ways to make the same money imo. No need for an irrational regulator.
I never play this ticker, just appealed to me since it was down so much, figured it may have a good pop. PT is over $400, but I just want tomorrow's calls to print...
Agree. It sucks but if played right can make a few swing trades.
Bro all you need is 1k and a 25 bagger
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna roll around or hurt you
BB isn‚Äôt even responding to this partnership yet. Still on a downward trend since earnings. If it can reverse it and then announce patent sale or beta release of BB Ivy it‚Äôs gonna meme

MRVL near ITM puts for next month are cheap. I like Marvell, but it‚Äôs been hovering around 59-60 these past 3 months. Don‚Äôt know how it got up to 66+. With techs volatility, I can see it going back down to 60 and hovering around there. Makes for some easy money

TLRY is squeezing the shorts. 2M volume on 2 orders right before open. If you saw it, you seen it up 2% and instantly drop to 0.
Investors frantically buying the stocks they franticslly sold yesterday morning
Why tf would you buy into that garbage company
Will FB get to $340 or are my calls Zcucked
What expiration? I have 01/21
This is a great green day, but sadly it will take a lot more to get back to where I was
Former fed chair calls for abolishing debt ceiling,  holy fucking shit, 450 eod possible
I love money, I love cows, I love money, I love boy cows
That's fine, do whatever you want. For me I see a stock I know with high probability will be trading several times higher than its current level in a few years.
i‚Äôll be back when i got 25k. should be about 8-12 months depending on how much i suck at saving.
Had TLRY calls. Sold bc it was down to 10.45 on bad earnings. Then those wallstreetfucks come back and say they ‚Äúmisreported‚Äù fuck you.
Just woke up xtremely erect because of AMDü§ëü§ë
Lmfaooooooo even better

folks talking about spy reversing, looks like lots or paper hands already cashing in ffs let her get some real momentum

One green day two red days one green day two red days
If y‚Äôall could buy a few shares of nikola that would be great . My bag holding party will be a hit if y‚Äôall had a bag too.
I had a dream that spy hit 1000 and I actually sold at a reasonable time and brought in 70k. As soon as I woke up I copped a put
Out of SPY calls with 250% profit across the board! Hopped into TLRY $12c and 500 shares. Oh yeah and I doubled down on SoFi let‚Äôs go!!
Whew, boys. I was thisclose to getting a margin call this week.
5 5 minute candles in a row closed red. Last one biggest of the series
Up 10% on the puts I got 10 minutes ago. Fuck bear and bull. Make money where there's money to be made. Realize profits.
Yeah. I havent found a good time to transfer. Think or swim for analysis rh because most capital is there.
It‚Äôs insane to think about the fact that there are people who went to school for years for finance and economics probably as long as I did to be an MD who are responsible for billions in assets, and these same idiots thought it was a good idea to short a company like baba at a p/e of 14 lmfao. Faith in human ability is declining gotta be honest. China bears, you literally deserved this. May god have mercy on your bankrupt souls
SPY, too soon jr
Legalization of THC is one of the best things that the U.S. is currently doing. Its a positive life change for so many people. I see no way around federal legalization within the next few years.
Haha. Sense doesn't pay very well in this market unfortunately.
So back to where we were a day ago? Kek
The Chinese stock market experiences 20% declines almost every year and has still outperformed the SP500 over the last decade.
It's the better part of a year's worth of net profit. And no guarantee it will be one-off.

Face it, you don't know for certain whether the profits actually belong to you, as a foreign "shareholder".
Have you considered growing shrooms? Very easy and a lot of fun. I wouldn't trade while on them though.

Go ahead and dip. I‚Äôll buy it.
We've been in a textbook wedge since 9/30. 

Congress is supposed to lift the debt limit, we gapped up. 

Shit is pretty straightforward
Diamond hands on these calls
Been holding BABA bags for over a year‚Ä¶ first time I sell covered calls well under my average it fucking skyrockets‚Ä¶ I hate trading
About 430 ‚úÖ
My wife says I need to stop texting you
Holy fuck these AAPL 145c are fucking dying
Why do you give random thots your number? Look playa you need a snapchat specifically designed to block hoes on a moments notice. And member if you stick your dick in crazy, always take that hoe to a hotel.
No prob. Looks up extrinsic and intrinsic value. Theta gang makes their money off extrinsic value falling to zero which it always does, and does exponentially faster near expiry.
Yes
samesies -- added puts on FB and MRNA.
#spy430 is now trending
Tsm is such a shut stock, get puts
Just keep it sorted by Hot posts
Truly retarded. You're their target customer.
lmao. Have fun losing money trading on pure emotion.
Just buy long shares on a portfolio (not standard) margin.  You get about the same leverage but without Theta decay.

healthy pull back on tlry
1.3 trillioners got baited by Credit Suisse
IV crush. Around -50 IV change
Tomorrow Open: $TLRY $12c will print

Tomorrow Noon: $TLRY $9.5p will print

Good day.
Why not today? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Fuck him. He called WSB "a clown car" on the air. He's a disrespectful, arrogant, boomer douche that needs to learn what a haircut is supposed to look like.
Still ain't buying BABA. If you haven't learned not to fuck with commie stocks by now after luckin, baba, evergrande, etc then idk.
DUOL is helping me learn how to say profits in 24 different languages.
what are you doing step spy, wrong way your supposed to only go up!
I should have bought them
The debt ceiling issue is now resolved. All of the other problems are still there though and should be reflected tomorrow or early next week
I‚Äôm thinking we‚Äôll have one of those rare -3% days ü•∞

TLRY bag holder checking in.  Fly pelican fly!!
i think it seems fucked on the surface but i think it's just legalese. going through the contract again it says that it's automatically renewed month to month rather than a long-term contract and i just have to give them 30 days advance notice if i don't want it renewed. plus the rate is locked in as a specified amount in the contract  so they can't raise it unless i sign a new contract.

I think the TLRY corrected ER caught some shorts. Fuck ‚Äòem!!
Smart move. I've been playing both sides and they've been printing.
Next divergent high
Absolutely, we‚Äôre not out of this bearish trend but these spy calls today are nice.. tomorrow maybe puts.
Big brain folks watch the most recent limiting factor video....
Yeah, but then we won't have femboys in our video games
Congratz to BABABULLS. Somebody who bought sub 10 cent calls yesterday should have at least a 10 bagger today. BABA up about 10%.

As Elton John said one time, I'm still standing
‚ÄúOk‚Äù
BACK TO 60$
How far is SPY going to dip tomorrow ü§î.
They made investments that will offer a return and get them in the good graces of the CCP, not donations. BABA is literally investing in things like rural internet access for common prosperity, which means more people buying their shit with their BABA funded internet. A one off 16bn investment is nothing for a company that makes 50bn in revenue a year.
Propose to her
You guys better hope spy doesn‚Äôt reverse because if it does you will never hear the end of it from me
Looking dark cloudish
TLRY $15 by tomorrow?
TLRY TLRY TLRY
My calls from last week actually hit. You mfers doubted me
Rugpull imminent here we go boys
Yeah the IV is through the roof in anticipation, tough time to roll out and you can and get burned if the announcement gets delayed and IV collapses.

Welcome back tendietown
If you think US rug pulls are bad, wait until CCP changes the rules again.
Guy still uses RH lmao
Guess it‚Äôs time for a spy put
I doubt it's going higher today. I'm betting on a dip tomorrow or Monday. I'm being conservative though. Only bought a few puts in case it's up tomorrow as well
An actual reasonable comment. Most of this sub shills bull v bear shit, so I‚Äôm glad somebody with sense is still around
Fuck her then give her cab money
Did I actually buy something (TLRY) at the bottom for once???
Yeah but still red for the yeat
Anyone who uses the word commie is a piece of shit tbh I can‚Äôt take you seriously
Bro it‚Äôs not going anywhere near 420 by 10/15. At best you‚Äôll get a little dip to 437 or if you‚Äôre really lucky a gap fill to 435 but after that we‚Äôre rocketing back to ATH as long as the debt ceiling issue has passed
SPY fucks. Don‚Äôt know why I bet against Murica.

Try huffing paint thinner.
The correction was good.  Got rid of weak WSB pump and dump hands, and created a buying opportunity for real investors.  I made $15k so far on my correction purchases.

Pls explain to me like all I do is lose money.

I picked up some 15c for 1/21/22
So happy
Invested into ARBK IPO, should have pulled out when i could have at 18, but i didnt wanna get fucked by robinhood for flipping and not being able to go into any other IPOs. Now its probably going to drop below 15 at this point

This market is still on hard mode you guys just haven‚Äôt realized it yet

Lmaoo celebrating a 4 percent day after -40 percent in 4 days. Seems very on character for a RIDE fanboyü§£ i bought in at 6.15 and sold at 8.67 along with some calls i raked in 200 percent on. I loved lordstown dips but this new news changes everything. Be careful and i wouldnt be long it
Godspeed I guess
So had I bought a naked call I'd be up 400 a contracts. Since I am ghey and did spreads only up like 70$. SO GHEY
Pretty much, I expect a theta day on Friday after the mini rally we had this week to recover from Monday, and I don't think the market will push much higher today.
GameStop was a meme
Maybe! 

Who the fuck knows anymore
Today‚Äôs my first day back in the office since March 2020. Holy fuck does this suck. I cannot believe I did this everyday for years. Completely forgot what it‚Äôs like to have to use a public restroom while some other guy is blowing mud in the stall.
Got one just for the hedge.. I feel ass

Sorry it‚Äôs fading I bought some vti shares a bit ago
It was like a year ago
Up 200% on my TLT puts from yesterday AM. Filled various growth majors and semi puts 30 minutes ago while everyone is caught up in this section ceiling hysteria that‚Äôs going to be back in the news in a month. Yields are spiking like crazy with all the job data.
TLRY slow down bb I can only coooom so many times before you hit 11.50
lmao. I find your desperate commie copium amusing. What makes you think this is about anything other than money?
Thanks this is the one. Just bought $7000 worth of PTON November $85 PUTS because of your comment lol
So I took my account from 8k to 32k over the past few weeks. Lost it all over the past few days. Yesterday, I accidentally went all in on spy calls before close and now I'm up to 25k. I sold my calls too early otherwise I could have been at 30k...
Oh my gourd!

Some would say that is a how a market performs at the top..  but certainly fundamentals don't matter.  News headlines  are flipping this market daily though.
It's about to go full gonzo.

Going to be amazing how fast the China narrative changes when people start making money. China will go from "un-investable" back to the next great growth story, like every other time this has happened. Media is always behind.

AAPL where the duck are you going
I have no idea, but I would assume yes they are selling data if they have advertisements. Think how confusing young people are when you get older, you'd rely on the data to tell you what to sell them. Again, speaking out of my ass but that'd what I would do.

And if you want to go down conspiracies, the government would definitely be interested in keeping tabs on the youngins and what they are getting into/direct them what to get into. Nobody would willingly join a social media company run by the federal government. But maybe they can still do it and act like it's a hip private cool company.

When I tell you I HATE consolidating shit. Like either go up or down, don‚Äôt be an indecisive bitch man
The $100 price for AMD and $200 price for NVDA were easy buys. Loving this.
Not when you buy stupidly otm options lmao
Look at 10 yr.  they are gunning it.  Sell off end of day.
BABA O RLY
Every day you hold an option they collect on the price you paid for the option. The closer to the date it expires the more percent they get. You buy an option for 10 percent more than its worth and if the stock stays flat you pay them some of that profit. If they sell a call and a put at the same strike and the stock stays flat they keep the profit off those overpriced options. Options have a theta decay which gets exponential the closer to expiry.
Yeah, AMD been consolidating for like two damn months. Finally making a move.
If you stop selling, it will keep going down as long as you own it.

It‚Äôs the same reason that Twitter has struggled for so long: it‚Äôs all advertising revenue and it‚Äôs not enough. 

Neither companies have made big changes to their business models and investors have still bought them up. Like every other stock.

I don‚Äôt care what all you Chyna sheep say. I‚Äôm not buying. What made them tank is still true. Xi hates money and can send them all back in the toilet tomorrow
Hey I‚Äôm Cramer. Welcome to Cramerica. I like BABA
Gonna rise into March Madness again this year
Crazy how it had 2M in volume right before open
Why? They'll probably print in the next couple of trading days
Make yourself a billionaire, then lose 99.9% of it.
Get your cheap outs for tomorrow‚Äôs report
Any devastating news out there on the horizon?
the stipulation for getting out of the contract due to a move requires documentation so i'd need probably at least a new bill or something

but the terms of the membership and the amenities of the gym are quite good especially for the price so i wasn't planning on cancelling unless i move anyways i just thought the language of the contract was pretty funny

Reminder gains are transitory. Don't forget to take profit!
Idk fam maybe
BABA over 9% lol, this is going to be ridiculous watching this climb back to a reasonable valuation.
They don't buy. They sell options and make theta work in their favor.
I would die lmao
IV crush on PLtR is horrible‚Ä¶ Calls barely moved but stock is up 2%
Realize profits while you can.  It will tank.
Do you have tits?

Yes, they're making it hand over fist, of 265000 Kilos of MJ distribution, largest Weed co. In the world rn and positioned to take a large portion of the US market, I've done mad research bruh, it's not a P&amp;D
just bought 30k worth of TLRY shares
*after the 50th attempt*
I've chilled a little myself since bloody Tuesday last week. Made one play this week and got out bc I felt myself getting worked up lol. Although if I had held an hour my gains would have been 10x üòÇ

Well my girlfriend lives in Canada and she's a model. My spare lambo is in the shop.

We are very much alike you see
Thanks, at least I can vent here and feel better. Cheers
Yep
Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm wondering ü§î not sure if the rough times are behind us
Yes you should buy the 450c for next week. Probably like 7 of them. Exactly 7 of them. I'll sell them to you for super cheap, you're practically robbing me
Most of you bull tards don‚Äôt realize with supply chain broken and costs dramatically higher during this next earnings season revisions will be lower.  Not to mention most likely higher Corp tax rates.
If youre okay with buying 300k worth of AMD, then there you go.

2 Green Day‚Äôs in a row?
BABA black sheep
exactly, they see what kids are interested in and advertisers want that. New generation data is probably more sought after, can give insight on what direction to go.
Good game
Gains?
But my $20 call expires June 2022 so I have a chance
Any opinions on Aptera? Can currently get in pre ipo with a minimum 1k investment and the car thing looks fuckin sick.
TLRY not being so TLGHEY anymore lol

I think they actually mentioned it was mid December but wasn't paying much attention.
They‚Äôre the ones you buy options from
This is so exciting
If you aren't in a hurry and want to multi-bag your money over the next few years, then yes buy BABA.
Don‚Äôt they sell?
I looked again. I figured out what you meant and I was wrong lol.
Here we go again.  All the green turns red for me around this time Every Single Day
I dont think the actual indicator matters that much, you're looking to build a best-estimate picture of how the big boys are positioned

People call it 'market sentiment' but i think that's pretty fucking stupid because any market participant worth a damn is not going to be trading based on sentiment, but cold hard probabilities
Fuck you bot.
yield is going up, that's bullish (since it means that bonds are going down).
I am
Bigg green dildo will come in for spy after lunch. Possibly going to 442 or more today. Like this, and it will happen.
I don't know what move to make. Not buying calls on a huge day
Wsb has investors?
TLRY has better management, a global footprint and is much larger. CGC has snoop and martha stewart. Honestly close call.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Tlry don't stop now, the day has only just begun.
$480 billion. That will kick the can down the road until what? January?
Not those who got in this morning around 10.75 üòé
I think it‚Äôs time to buy 10/8 FB calls

So much pain playing BABA calls,  finally paying off. We‚Äôre all gonna make it bros
Ima just let my shorts ride out. If I lose I lose, part of the game.
No‚Ä¶..
child mobility is super low, most parents are too afraid to let their kids play outside, as a result in order to socialize they must turn to the internet.

same thing with kids, if they are lucky @ 16 with a car, they have to turn to the internet.

thats why SNAP is the future of consumption.

Nope.  Only playing with 10% of my portfolio now.  Rest in cash.  This is a massive bubble created by algos pushing FOMO prices and short squeezes.  Interest rate hikes and tapering will crash the markets.
That‚Äôs the plan
Cgc is for üåàüêªs
No
Mix it with milk 1part to 1 part and you will have 1/2 and 1/2
Im genuinely sorry
I was looking at those too but I decided to go wider because the times we live in
Sold my calls, waiting to see if the market dips a bit from this rally. Probably will buy again EoD friday.

Calls is the way.
Oh for sure! And then the misreported earnings perfect storm for calls and shares on the dip
That's a good thing. Free money machine

Stop selling then, it‚Äôs called buy and never sell. Kind of like buy land and never sell. Equities aren‚Äôt getting cheaper especially undervalued ones like Chinese ones
Debt ceiling got squeezed
I bought 5 shares like 4 months ago, its the only one in my portfolio that keeps everything green. It was at 111 about 4 days ago, now its at its ATH again near 136. Not sure if I should buy more now or wait....
I think you made the right choice in the long run tbh.
Knee pads
I need it to get to 14! Come on baby
Now delete the app for a few days
Yup, doubt they covered tho
No idea, but much higher than it‚Äôs been settling at. Huge growth, ‚Äúunique‚Äù product to separate from Starbucks, big following. Its gonna grow like a weed the next 5 years or so. Not a short play
Keep buying, not selling! ü§†ü§ùüêÇ
Maybe so but as long as it doesn‚Äôt fail while I‚Äôm holding I‚Äôm good.
Dear cash gang. This is why you don't. 

Best.
Dropping Monday at the latest
If you watched the price 2 minutes before open there was literally 2 large sell orders that plummeted it.

AskReddit if I care, bro. watch the order flow on BABA and watch 3k shares get traded every second till market close and tell me you're playing with big money. I don't give a fuck about your stock pick, BABA is great. I was just commenting on your cringe rants on here and your post history. You smoke the wrong shit
Which is in your opinion??
I for one am shocked that ber r so fuk again
debt limit raised... sell the news? it's not like we were going to fucking default
disappointment?
Have you ever looked at the content on snapchat? 

Investors are willing to pay a premium for that content. 

I can‚Äôt imagine how complete garbage aimed at tweens/teens will ever become super profitable.

The truth:

Now is the best time EVER to have an OVERHYPED company that doesn‚Äôt make money. Investors will buy anything that could be construed as high growth. It doesn‚Äôt if you don‚Äôt have a product, just don‚Äôt get caught like NKLA.
Hahaha. You‚Äôre better at making jokes than me.
TLRY let's goooo üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Break 442 and we go straight to 450 eod
No, the reason is because China uncertainty is mitigated by potential better relations with USA. Has nothing to do with fundamentals
Of course NIO runs the day after I sell.  I don't like this game anymore.

CNBC is completely wrong about BABA. 

They just said the reason it‚Äôs up is because of Charlie Munger doubling down but the reason is strong Chinese holiday sales spending
No mercy they deserve what they get for betting like idiots. Bulls are investors bears are gamblers. No pity
I was explaining to a TSLA bull that TSLA need crude oil.

I too had these. I held through the loss and bought 11/19 $450‚Äôs during the dip and sold those today

Go look at the hang seng index history then shut the fuck up. It‚Äôs at 24k and if it was valued like spy it would be 100k

Nah I'm talking about all the shit you type. It's not hard to outperform the market with small money
One thing ive learned the hard way is always take the profit, however with basically a year left you have good odds to make more
Once big money starts flowing back into BABA this things going to be back to 250. Feeling confident in these leaps
Oh I see.  We just ignoring the 10 yr today‚Ä¶
Any body have info on short interest in GOGO or BROS ? Both look like they want to run but there is hardly any volume on either one

My 10/15 SPY 450c might still have life. Please bull god
yeah that too

you get used to losing thousands and you're like eh whatever.
Donkey Kong is rippin!  My bags are getting lighter by the minute. $56 is my break even.
I was like you in the past, but i eventually grew tired of being depressed. 

Trying different stuffs now. I realised having hope for a brighter future pushed me forward. Im still poor as fk, but now i have hopes of making it big. Buy my course. Jk.
Yeah. I just stopped. I could have been fucked if it went the opposite
I‚Äôm a member of Tilray‚Äôs bagholders anonymous too, come to a meeting with me sometime brother
[deleted]
I‚Äôm just gunna out this out there for those of you who don‚Äôt have much experience with long term investing or financial math, but basically my trading group who has been doing this shit since like the 1960s and 70s have calculated that it‚Äôs literally impossible for baba to earn under 50 a share by 2029-2031 like that‚Äôs the bottom of the barrel bear case and the math checks out big time, it‚Äôs very frugal for baba and there‚Äôs bear case years of only 5% growth for half of them, which is absurd because they will compound 30% growth like always. But anyhoooo, 50 a share at 25 p/e is 1250 a share. Yea‚Ä¶this is a fucking buy and don‚Äôt let CNBC shake you out when they do the China shake out shit again in a few years.
Sounds like you‚Äôre the little man to me, poor little peasant ü§°
SPY calls printing
SPY let's stay flat for today and reserve the action for tomorrow.
Have you logged on since 2019?
It wasn‚Äôt me. I only upvote.  Or ignore.

No investment value for baba.
BABA in green? Looks like fake bounce off

Nice.   Take the day off before you lose it all.

Wow what a dip holy shit
You put that in bold and made me read it. Holy shit NVDA   7.5% since Tuesday and your calls are fucked?
RIOT.  Coin goes up 10 % riot goes up 2% Coin goes down 2 % riot goes down 2.5%.  The asymmetry is impressive.

WDYM NVDA up more than AMZN/AAPL/etc. today, and not far off AMD.  It's chart seems to follow QQQ perfectly the last week or so.

Yep
I hope that guy with 450 Spy calls considers cashing out.
I think we are in for a low 439 close
The US just invaded China and the stock market is still not crashing. Lol
Just sayin it‚Äôs already insane and idk how people continue to go seemingly everyday.
Politicians came to an understanding. There is no more dip. Recession is canceled effective now
Arr psfe 45c worth it?
üêÇü§°üëÜüèº
Huge pivot here, if this holds we've broken that short-term downtrend, if we dip and close back below 440 there is still a good chance we head back down even if temporarily.

Very positive action so far though
Here is your SPY dip. Still think 2% day is incoming
It‚Äôs up 2.5%?
Mods - this guy right here
Oh yea. This morning I went to buy some but got 10/8 instead by accident!  But likely it‚Äôs up 565% at the moment. So sell them later then maybe a small dip tomorrow then I‚Äôll buy a bunch $450c 10/15
It's not really house money if youre recovering last week's losses though. Back to where I was.
It‚Äôs all about creating a habit and sticking to it for more than a week. 

Try something less restrictive before diving into a full blown diet. See what works for you.

I generally do low carb high protein and fat throughout the week, then let myself relax on the weekends with a cheat meal or two. Don‚Äôt over do it but you can still be healthy and eat foods you like. It‚Äôs all about moderation.

Also stay active. Minimum 3 days a week of ~45mins of exercise. Even if it‚Äôs just going for a slow walk.

Bought some calls so you might wanna buy puts
In 1972 a McDonald's hamberger was 28 cents. In 10 more years that shit will be like 28 bucks with the way that our government is spending fucking money right now.

Please don‚Äôt consider yourself smart money for holding BABA until 2030üòÇ

I'll take it. I was think 443. But I'm happy as fuck at 445.
"Keto" was my diet of choice this week. I lasted 3 days.

"Low calorie filling foods" was my choice last week.

Intermittent fasting, the week before. 

And here I am, crying in the taco bell parking lot with 4000 calories of food in my lap.

There is simply nothing in this world for me. I have a worthless teaching degree. A low paying stressful teaching job. A binge eating disorder. Fat slob living paycheck to paycheck with no friends, hopes, or goals. 

I deserve nothing in this world. I will inevitably die poor and alone, sometime in my mid 50s from a heart attack. The state will burn me.

either i blow my last 1k or i live to see another day
oh yeah, i mean permabull here, i averaged down on what started as 2 november spy calls into 30 of them...and the rubberband has snapped fo sho. Just mean that on those days where we dumped so heavy, any green candle immediately wiped out, a bit of that today in reverse
Now imagine that, but make it ten years before the shit you‚Äôre seeing and talking about starts to happen.

right? I was down 50% on BABA. at that point. that money doesn't even exist anymore. selling would never cross my mind. now just give me like 6 or 7 more days like today.... please.....
already won if you didnt take 560% profit from dip yesterday you ballsy with how this market been acting
I‚Äôm thinking institutions aren‚Äôt certain a futures etf will get approved by the sec. Also, the recent spikes look like scam wicks, both up and down.  The more people think the candles are scam wicks, the more one needs to be concerned about the possibility that coins are supported by excessive leverage.
Miners require lots of capital, it‚Äôs like farming, except the crops can be sold quickly. The problem is that the price of the crop is so damn volatile. Also, when miners go low, they go fucking low. Look how quickly money fled after the may dump. I think money wants there to be more stability in corn‚Äôs price.

looking at SPY calls while holding TSLA calls... ü§°
Yeah, Debt ceiling extended until December.  That fixes everything.   It fixes semiconductor shortages, unloads 100 cargos ships anchored at sea, brings down inflation, fixes the energy crisis in China, eliminates China‚Äôs strong-hold on HK and TW.  Just a fucking distraction to what is to come in the 4th QTR.
Max pain 434 good time for puts
Honestly I just wait for the bears to come out and then know it‚Äôs time to load up on calls
Sell some, might keep the rest until 445

You having a bad day, sunshine? üòÇ
All the new accounts downvoting me when I bought BABA calls at $138 while they bought puts lmao
Guess who accidently bought Amazon Weeklies for 14 times it's value
What are your thoughts on TSLA? Why did it spike so hard earlier this week and now went back below 800?

Would it be smart to blow my savings on TSLA monthly or is it going to cuck me theta gang style again
Bro you late son
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_down)
The open interest on Pelosi‚Äôs calls is telling us the debt ceiling will be raised today
Debt ceiling fears was the major reason making SPY dip like crazy the past week. Now that it's pushed back to like December, should have some green days ahead

Finally getting out of my RH account, but had a question. I'm transferring the cash from sales out to another exchange by allowing Plaid to use my RH account as a bank account.

I moved a bunch of cash out this morning and it shows on the new exchange as deposited, but the balance on RH hasn't gone down. Is there a lag somewhere on this, and how long?

Where else would it have pulled the money from? I have confirmed the account #, etc. is the RH account.

I got kicked out this morning for posting a boomer holding his crotch. I was shocked as I normally post weird crap and this specifically wasn‚Äôt much worse then most.
Imagine selling China at the fucking bottom holy shit, and for literally ZERO REAL BEAR CASE. If this market has taught me one thing it‚Äôs how absolutely fucking brain dead an average IQ actually is which is what drives the market sadly. Munger was so fucking ahead of the curve he started buying early. Being smart makes you early to shit that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve had to work on a lot as a trader. About the time he was buying I was wanting to DCA but I force myself to wait because I know if I see something it‚Äôs going to take no less than a month for the average investor to see it.
I wanted to buy BABA. ended up buying his retarded brother DADA

BB partnering with Deloitte is a big deal. If they capitalize with some PR about beta version of IVY and even the patent sale into this could totally meme into the $20‚Äôs again
It's not so much a catch 22 as a equalization valve.  As rising yields create pressure out of stocks, movement into bonds releases that pressure and things go back to stable.  They will often continue to rise past equilibrium as they overshoot the mark, then move back down.  Where large unpredictable moves happen is when there is a lot of uncertainty in multiple variables.
I always try to hold them to squeeze more out, then get burned every time.  Learned my lesson.
TLRY I love you. But I mostly hate you. Don‚Äôt understand you

Rip Dave
I get how bonds works and what not and that its expected that as the fed tapers... yields rise, and then stocks go down because investors move to bonds.  what youre saying is that as investors move from stocks to bonds the bond yields stop rising because investors are now buying all the bonds putting downward pressure on yields?? I guess that makes sense, but seems like a catch 22... and likely just a hiccup right? investors can only buy so many bonds, and once the mass exodus from stocks is over then bonds should continue to rise? or am i way off?

My point is it doesn't matter what people believe or vote on when we're talking about things that are beyond the control of man. News flash the universe is a dictatorship and the master is mother nature. If you add currency to the system there is more of it and less of everything else. Platinum is worth whatever people are willing to pay for it. No one is going go mine gold for the compensation of a grain of rice. When you understand the absurdity of what you've said here today you'll understand what you've said is no different than saying people will voluntarily starve themselves to death so the Fed can keep minting trillion dollar coins without changing relative purchasing power.

Bow down before me, as I am the biggest baller here. I just sold a single SPY call that I bought 3 days ago for a $250 gain. My financial genius knows no bounds.

I bought FIZZ awhile ago and because I‚Äôm on this thread when it was dipping I bought a ton of stock because I also drink a certain beverage of theirs a lot and felt if I was going to buy their product the way I was I might as well buy their stock. Now it‚Äôs making me a pretty penny and I‚Äôm not sure if I should sell now or see if it will go higher. Late jan they had a huge spike in price so I‚Äôm not sure if I should bother even looking at that as a referral point as it‚Äôs connection isn‚Äôt clear to me on why it did shoot up as this was before my time. So my question is‚Äî what‚Äôs y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts on the stock?
SPY has no resistance until 500

Selling spy calls too soon amounts to instant regret instead of tendies
SPY has jumped almost $12 in one day.
Just bought a spy call for Dec 31, if I lose money on this I‚Äôm quitting the market

Water is actually not wet; It makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the state of a non-liquid when a liquid adheres to, and/or permeates its substance while maintaining chemically distinct structures. So if we say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the object.

Personally I have calls right now but the bearish case is really easy to make. Debt ceiling is definitely not the only reason the market has been down the last month, SPY has had three green days in a row now including today but we still haven‚Äôt broken the downtrend, and we‚Äôre coming up on some heavy resistance points. Puts aren‚Äôt exactly a crazy play
Lots of green today.
I try to tell my sister that she can‚Äôt be a teacher cuz the pay is piss poor and to be a Econ major but whatever at least I try
Profit is profit my dude. Gains compound and there will always be another play. I sold half my SPY position yesterday 5 mins before close thinking it'll tank and left quite a bit of money on the table too. No regrets (well maybe some regrets for like 5 mins lol). Profit is profit.

Not an expert.  So, bond yields are the ratio of their dividend to share price.  When the stock market is too risky for people with low risk tolerance they move their money into bonds.  This causes share price to increase.  Since the dividend doesn't change, the yield drops.  The lower the yield, the less attractive bonds become, driving investors back to stocks.  The market seeks equilibrium, but this can be disrupted by monetary policy, especially interest rates which affect both bond dividends and inflation.

Is this when we start making money?

Biggest bull trap ever. This can't stay this high. It will finish week 435 max
The bears are fat and happy because they sold Monday.

Everyone still holding puts were pigs.
I bought some FDs yesterday that dropped 74% in value within 2 hours. I think I actually might make money on them today. wtf
Or just sell short, no?

Oooweeee it‚Äôs coming

It's totally possible, bond yields can be a sign of healthy growing economy, or market can behave irrationally. I think there are Lllots of reasons why, but yeah, it's typically inversed.

NOT FINACIAL ADVICE BUT A STRATEGY I LIKE

Instead of closing your calls, you can sell calls against your calls to help maintain profits while reducing risk. Sell sooner to expire calls for calendar spread set ups.
If it pulls all the way back to close their puts are still fucked.
10 year spiking like crazy. Time to load some growth puts.
After I down an 8 pack I think my body looks good too
Going to sell my calls at open for profit and stare at the screen the rest of the day not knowing what to put my money in next üëç
Watch them pull the rug.
Big dip at open IMO
I've said that a few times before... Will regret if you're right but I'm not losing money there today.
is it even possible for the market to climb w bond rates climbing i thought they inversed each other.

TLRY staying really stable during the earnings call, lots of good info. I may actually end up holding some of my shares long term for the long term upside. Still need it to run so I can sell my calls lol
Big sell off today

Yes. It makes them feel important and worthy.

If you‚Äôre fired or quit, you generally can‚Äôt get UI. I work for a hospital system, we‚Äôre not firing people per se. They are on unpaid leave until they get in compliance and, if they still can‚Äôt prove a month later that they‚Äôre in compliance, they‚Äôre considered to have resigned. In our case, 94% of doctors and clinical staff are in compliance and many of the rest are what we call PRN (on-call fill-in nurses and such).

i say this as a person who drinks what would probably be considered "way too much coffee" but i think most of the colloquial opinions about coffee/caffeine are more myth than fact. i personally have never gotten a headache when i don't get coffee and i normally drink about 4 or 5 cups a day, sometimes more

First of all, this is not true, the Us continental was fiat. Also, how are we still arguing about fiat vs gold/silver standard in 2021? It‚Äôs like arguing about creationism versus Darwinism

They used the overnight session to drive futures through some significant resistance in order to open the SPY at the mid bollinger band.

I can't see it hold up. I imagine there are people who were caught on their heels by the selling throughout September that are looking for a rip higher to unload some bags.

that's an exaggeration and people just use it as an excuse to be insufferable bitches and pricks in the morning

About time we see green again
Fuck. I was going to buy a ton of $440 SPY FD‚Äôs for today but decided not to last minute. I knew papa Powell would have never let this dip last this long.
Low but one can hope
Baba bears are straight dead. All the major ones will never be able to cover because there won‚Äôt be enough float available at low prices. Soros just by himself would boost the stock 10-20 bucks with the price action if he tried to cover. It‚Äôs over for them but they are fucking stupid and deserve this

Looks like the market is optimistic from the deal McConnell (turtle) offered yesterday. But, no deal has actually been made yet. There might still be some fear left in this market.
It‚Äôs almost like Wall Street suits tell them what to say before they air so that they can fuck retail. These idiots were telling people to short fucking alibaba the best company in earth at a forward p/e under ten instead of buying. Never listen to them, just keep an eye on them so you know what their agenda is. Keep your enemies close
Hell yeah. That and the temple prayer song that shoes up in various forms throughout the game.

I thinks it's like RSI, you have to shift according to environment. Traditionally a correction is 10% but in this environment it would be less likely you would get to 10% before mass buying starts
Sell at open. Coming up to resistance around $440. I think you can buy back your calls cheaper later in the day.

-Chinese households expected to allocate more savings to equities and less to real estate in the future. This is a big one.

After I returned to the U.S., I obtained a document showing a detailed account of Tether Holdings‚Äô reserves. It said they include billions of dollars of short-term loans to large Chinese companies‚Äîsomething money-market funds avoid. And that was before one of the country‚Äôs largest property developers, China Evergrande Group, started to collapse. I also learned that Tether had lent billions of dollars more to other crypto companies, with Bitcoin as collateral. One of them is Celsius Network Ltd., a giant quasi-bank for cryptocurrency investors, its founder Alex Mashinsky told me. He said he pays an interest rate of 5% to 6% on $1 billion in loans from Tether. Tether has denied holding any Evergrande debt, but Hoegner, Tether‚Äôs lawyer, declined to say whether Tether had other Chinese commercial paper. He said the vast majority of its commercial paper has high grades from credit ratings firms, and that its secured loans are low-risk, because borrowers have to put up Bitcoin that‚Äôs worth more than what they borrow. ‚ÄúAll Tether tokens are fully backed,‚Äù he said.

Then starting October 1st I decided to be like you degenerates and start playing SPY.  Up 1.5k in less then a week, hoping to be above 5k by the end of this week if this volatility continues.

Big fan. Where do you get your coke from?
the broker i use is dodgy as fuck, the spreads they apply to these foreign stocks is criminal, and then they make it worse by not giving you the chart option to show a buy and a sell price so you can see the spread visually.

Big pops are almost always tempered by profit taking. I‚Äôd sell at open. Wait for a dip. Buy back in.
It never gets solved and it always gets pushed back.

No, it was overbought on RSI. They always have news stories to fit the price movement. SIMULAtion
This is legit as a retail bear you have like one good red day to sell and that‚Äôs it. China bears only pulled it off due to collusion with most of Wall Street, this dip would not have been possible without extreme collusions this was a 5-7 sigma event depending on the stock which is basically impossible and proves there was rigging. It was an attempt to get smaller funds and retail margin called so they could buy a large dip. I know who is responsible and I‚Äôll have their heads before my time on earth is done I assure you

Glad you weren't successful, buddy. I had a few close calls when I was younger and I'm glad I didn't. Life sucks, but it's worth living. I mean, you'll very soon have an infinite amount of time being dead regardless - might as well fuck around here and enjoy it while you can.

Not like I sold 12/17 515c for a fraction of what it‚Äôs worth now ü§°
Is telling your call is fuked
You just kidding which is funny bc all the unvaxxed regards think that‚Äôs actually a possibility
Exactly.  It's almost like all these teenagers and know-nothing 20 somethings don't understand what actually happens with a default.
So who's the ü§° who sold TLRY at 10.50? Show yourself
Guarantee it won‚Äôt
So Tilray earnings were not green. Stop loss engaged.

Fuck that bill. No one ever complained about taking profits. Hold the puts cause the way this market is going, I would think you‚Äôd be able to recoup some losses even if today goes really well.
why save them, tho?

Slowly unload the riskiest strikes on momentum
Got a notification from CNBC that TLRY was a big moving stock today. No, it's not.
Not necessarily
It's not solved. It's just pushed back
People love to say, ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt fit the criteria for communist country‚Äù.
Honestly, I think they'll pull back to save some of the bears, then go back to uptrending. 

When you see the opening, dump your puts.
Was wrong about selling calls yesterday, though. Holding overnight worked out.
The color of üåàüêªüçë after the fucking üêÇ will give them
That's what I'm thinking but what if for some reason they actually pass the temporary debt ceiling relief bill.
Did bears really think they wouldn‚Äôt postpone the debt ceiling deadline? Like it‚Äôs happened MANY times in the past‚Ä¶ you think this time is different?
What‚Äôs the good news? I‚Äôm holding spy calls exp tomorrow. Sell at open or keep holding
Get ready for the tech orgy today, apes.

I believe in my heart that bears are fucked, but I also know that premarket loves to bait and switch. Until open, my balloon knot shall remain clenched.
I thought corrections went the other way.

Wrist still feels funny but I‚Äôm good I‚Äôm alive I‚Äôm feeling better - landed a new job that pays a ton more than I‚Äôve ever made before...

But most importantly I‚Äôm grateful to be alive because if I died, I‚Äôd have never loaded up on all these fucking SPY calls 

Seriously, fucking bears into the dirt makes it worth it

And here I thought the real concern dragging down the market was the rest of the bad news out there. Peeps think it was just the debt ceiling.


Don't buy the dip yet. Just another calm before the storm baby.
Lost so much on TSM calls over the last month. Why not try this again...
If you're not all in on WISH at these prices, you are not a real WSB og.  This is going to 4x easy. Buy shares not options you geeks.

Had a 40% revenue gain since last year at this time. And expected $80 million saved with the aphria merger. Honestly as far as long term holds go this is in my top 3 choices.
The whole yesterday I was screaming SPY calls and people said that I was on a bad acid trip.
No I did not
The cool down was September
It will take weeks for Russia to ramp up IMO, but they aren‚Äôt going to do this for free.
Kinda of funny they pumping right to resistance over night at open. FOMO gona be a bitch and the rug pull will be hilarious
Feels weird being pleasantly shocked in the AM.
Bonus in cash
Yep
You aren‚Äôt selling until you break even. Only need an 80 percent gain
I won't believe it until I see it!
What is this ‚Äògreen‚Äô you mention? I‚Äôm not used to it

Yeah, I don't have any positions in both companies anymore. I was very bullish on EVs last year and made a lot of money from that, but right now the only thing I have left is my Ford stocks in my boomer portfolio and a few short term calls on Nio that I bought this monday.

$BABA same valuation from 2017, except 5X growth today since then.

I'm NOT holding any positions in BABA and I ain't saying this pump is it, but if it does gain some positive momentum it would be a shame not to take a quick position to recover some or all of our losses lately. I just want us all to have a win after getting gapped these past weeks.
Agreed but still‚Ä¶ fuck this shit
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying
TSM calls at open. Bottom of trend. Pt 186 by next year
Yes it was...
Bears just tried to make $5 to buy 20 piece McNuggies, don't give them a hard time guys.
Volume 5k and 2ks. I don't think this is real, either. But, we'll see.
PSFE calls so cheap if it gets momentum it will print so much.
it's cringe comedy tbh
They‚Äôll be worthless by then lol
I once played SPY puts bc the market is overvalued. Learned never to fuck w JPow‚Äôs printer. Bought OTM 431c‚Äôs and 432c‚Äôs of SPY yesterday during the dip and sold the 431c‚Äôs for a sizeable profit thinking how much further is it gonna go w the debt ceiling negotiations in the air. 432c‚Äôs gonna fucking P R I N T at open with SPY at 439 now.

That's an interesting take - a lot of big earnings are next week.
Feeling more bullish. Charts looks like it might start trending upwards if this can hold support. Kinda liked being a bear for a little bit though lol

holy shit this piece in The Telegraph about this girl who was a maid for a super rich family has to be one of the dumbest premises i've ever heard (i guess it's an ad for the maid's memoir and apparent Netflix adaptation).

&gt;She barely spoke to any of her clients; some never bothered to learn her name.

&gt;Still, she got to know them intimately 

&gt;But none fascinated her more than the Cigarette Lady, a middle-aged housewife who lived next to a golf course with her construction magnate husband

&gt;But the woman also harboured a secret.

**spoiler alert** the secret was that the lady *smoked cigarettes*

also in this twitter thread they refer to Virginia Slims as "upmarket" which idk if it's true or not but that's what my mom used to smoke when i was growing up and i don't think we were quite "upmarket" consumers

If you think Baba is undervalued just wait until you see real estate stocks
Not only do I own baba but I make a good bit selling calls every week
Yes
I don't. I believe we're close to this being over, especially with earnings coming up.

Realistically we‚Äôll open pretty high then fade then idk maybe go back up but probably not an insane amount
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
There is a decent bear case, but everything has a proce. At some point the risk has to be considered priced in. I was waiting until $130 and missed the boat. Hope you make lots of money, now stop calling people racist just because they're nervous about Authoritarian Communist regimes interfering with their investments. That's not racist.
Oh bears you gullible fucks
Never could.
This ain't new. They just have Internet now and everyone can see it happen in real time.
I‚Äôm starting to feel bad for those who get fooled into baba. IMO if they are going to gamble just go all in on wish üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I'm referring to earnings today.
Have 350 shares. But will sell at 1000
So glad I loaded up on NIO calls when they were basically for free
SPY 1% PM? this is nuts. 450c it is
Yep.  There is some humor here.

It's possible. They held the CEO at CCP site for weeks because he said the wrong things. 

Imagine if Biden arrested Bezos and held him. 

I think BABA is coming back but I also see this isn't üá∫üá∏ and they have different rules
Block me bro. But I‚Äôm not about to watch you pump baba so you can dump your bags. We have enough pump and dumps as it is
Nope

No problem. They tried to make it sound that way, but I read the original piece and it clearly was not. Organ recipients have to be on immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives to prevent the body from rejecting the organ so they have to be fully vaccinated against any disease they can because they are much higher risk.
Bulls down 99% after 1 month lol
Market is closed on Monday and shit has ran enough already, tm eod or Tuesday morning might be the move
Haha. Well done Michael. The debt ceiling deal is going to be a sell the news event isn‚Äôt it?  Red light. üêÇüî´ü©∏

I‚Äôm so dumb I thought it would dump EOD yesterday and all it did was go up.

My outs are FUKd and I am ashamed I bought them. 

Shame! Shame! Shame!
Yea bears are dumb they really believe it will go to zero somehow lol. Just ignore and keep doing your thing
I'll be interested to see if we have a pullback before open

Facts. While not everyone, the mast majority of people have at least some version of it.
best example was when the market was tumbling a few months ago and they said, we'll be more transparent and careful with our decisions later, then next fucking day/week they declare a new surprise regulation.
show us your loss porn
Dude.
Honestly, I am surprised it took a positive track yesterday. Mitch McConnell will straight crash the world economy if it means he can blame the other Party and pick up 3 Senate seats. He doesn't give a fck.

Never listen to those idiots
You kid have a good heart!
What political risk? I think you should go deeper into what's actually being regulated as supposed as just basing on the typical "crackdown" clickbait
I thought we might gap up slightly and then run, but shit, bers about to get fuk real hard today.
It's almost 440. I'll stick to my word and assume we're uptrending again once it touches that mark.

Until then, unreal and rainbowed.
look at money bags over here
Don‚Äôt have to be a China bear to read a chart.  China = big risk.  Xi does whatever the fuck he wants‚Ä¶people forget they don‚Äôt play by the same rules.

You‚Äôre coming off as desperate. I don‚Äôt like to block people but I‚Äôm going to have to block you if you don‚Äôt cut it out. Idk what your motives are against China but they can not possibly be good.
That makes sense. I know the requirements are strict I just assumed from this person‚Äôs comment that it was specific to the COVID vaccine. Thanks for the clarification.
Everything this guy says is dumb af
You need to play both sides, so that you always come out the loser.

No disrespect, but you sound like a teenager.
Hey guys I know it's fun to shit on the bears about how fuk they are. But let's remember how it felt for a couple weeks there when bulls were fuk.
I said I‚Äôd cream if spy opened at 437‚Ä¶..
Just from a common sense of fundamentals and technical analysis: tell me why BABA is not the biggest bargain right now? Lol keep feeding my calls, baba bears.
Terrible news? Appl 150 eod

Facts. Like they would think China will just give the beauties of capitalism and socialize everything.
Connect the tops on the qqq chart and the bottoms since oct last year. You will see we hit the bottom of the channel the last 2 days. Correction over. Going back to the top of the channel. They will give us another bear trap next week. Don‚Äôt miss out.
it's kinda newsworthy because the debt ceiling still exists for some reason so it's good to point out the silliness of it

mint the coin
This isn‚Äôt going to hold. I‚Äôm going back to sleep til market open
Haha, sorry. Perion is still exceptionally cheap at its current price. You'll hear the same sentiment from everyone following this stock (visit Stocktwits, etc.). My exit plan is around $40, but depending on their Q4 performance, I may shift it to $50-60. Bear in mind that other similarly performing ad tech companies, or worse performing (Pubmatic), are \~3-8x the value of Perion for no good reason whatsoever, outside of hype. After this triple bottom bounce, it looks like Perion is going to break-out.

TLRY is supposed to be a growth company, what growth company gives the CEO cash instead of shares?  Something smells, I‚Äôm short as well.
Which one of you jackasses bought puts at close lol? Show yourself!
Wait it's postponed THAT long?
It‚Äôs not though. Read the other comments about organ recipient requirements. They are super strict and with organ shortages they automatically go to people with the highest chance of survival. It‚Äôs not like the doctors choose, it‚Äôs a weighted statistic and vaccination status (not just for covid) is part of it.
You can always find bad news if you look for it
Would the recipient accept to take medecine to make sure his body accept the new organ or would refuse because he think Gates put 5g into it? If someone don't believe in taking a single shot they probably won't believe in taking whatever medecine will make their body accept this foreign organ.

It would be much better if the transplant go to someone who believe in taking all the measures to assure his health will improve.
No why would they do that? Just pass it down the road until they‚Äôre out of their seats

Is this all because mcconnell said he'd postpone the debt ceiling stuff til Dec?

People are denied transplants for all sorts of reasons from social, to support system, to comorbidities... if a person is unwilling to take all measure to ensure health and wellness the transplant should go to someone else. They don‚Äôt want to put a liver in someone than have them die from Covid shortly after. Especially since when given a transplant you are placed on immunosuppressant drugs

I wouldn't fuck with Friday calls today. SPY is running way too hot after the news yesterday.  Calls for next week are a good play though
What's more enjoyable, futures down 1.5% and market melting up all day to up %1+?

Or, futures up 1% and market melting up all day to 3% up. 

Because, why not right?
Look at that spicy TLRY DIP... yum

I don't care how you try to deflect it.

From the other side, looks like dems want to burn the US to the ground by printing and spending money we do not have. Checks and balances are needed. If dems want to spend on their projects, then they need to start discussing what to cut. Dems are sounding like a teenager with a credit card and no responsibility to pay it back.
Debt ceiling being raised isn‚Äôt even ‚Äúpublic‚Äù yet, I can‚Äôt wait for EOD
It's bouncing back from oversold territory, and at these levels, it is still considered a value stock company that is growing exponentially. Most credible analysts with strong track records have their price targets at $30, and now it's getting shifted to $40.

So stop spending. Don't default on what you already spent.
Not a single bearish signal indicating a bad earnings it may barely push the price up but it will go up. CEO gets a crap ton of money in bonuses. Bullish. Earnings is released earlier and in PM and not pushed back a date? Bullish. Merger with Medmen and increasing product diversity up the ass‚Ä¶ I could go on.
Bull fuk today

Yeah but using our strategic reserves is like applying a band aid. We still have a supply deficit and we won‚Äôt start drilling ourselves. I bet you we have a bullish move into winter for oil

It‚Äôs pretty common to refuse transplants to patients who cannot support life. This seems like a reasonable case of not wanting to give limited transplants to patients with [anencephaly](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/anencephaly.html).

I hope you get a box of assholes. Happy Day
Lmao do you have any idea what requirements you have to meet for an organ transplant? Clearly not

Edit: Organs are in short supply. Organ assignment is prioritized towards whomever will help that organ live the longest. Organ recipients are on immunosuppressants the rest of their lives. If you‚Äôre not willing to get a vaccine to reduce your risk of death, you‚Äôre a lower priority to receive the organ than someone who is. Same reason nonreformed alcoholics don‚Äôt get liver transplants. Choices have consequences.
Tf r u on. U invested too and lost 300k. Chinese companies been around for decades. Nothing new has changed. Prices swing wildly. Get over it

Very intelligent conclusion.
I‚Äôm above break even except on some leaps. Doesnt matter though I know what the company is worth in the long run. That‚Äôs because I actually know how to invest responsibly

What changed your mind?
The idea of having a ceiling is supposed to force a conversation on whether the country should be spending as much as it does. Without one we probably would have seen even worse runaway spending/inflation. Of course it's been completely diluted and corrupted that it doesn't really have a function.

Up until Berz got their 5% pullback, SPY had been running up 2.5% MoM like clockwork. We have 2.75 months left in this year to make approx 4 months of gains since they robbed us of September. I'd say any calls under 460 for December are gonna make for happy new year.

Not a good idea. Why not wait til qqq hit top of the channel again. Simple
Perion Network bouncing off a beautiful triple bottom, going to test $22 again shortly (likely today) and will definitely smash through imo. Valued at 1x revenue, very profitable, growing 35-40% YoY, and valued 4-10x less than their same industry peers with the same performance. They just made a great acquisition (accretive immediately), raised 2021 and 2022 guidance for the second time in the quarter, and got bumped to a $40 price target by Oppenheimer yesterday. Extremely diverse ad tech powerhouse flying completely under the radar.

What other costs come with starting your own tax preparation business? Surely it's not just the software cost
Yeah and Tesla factories will be shut down by the CCP next week. Get a grip
PDD $106 by Friday

A lot of users are gonna be seeing cashflows

I used Intuit Proseries when I did taxes. I liked the program. On a real note though, Fck tax prep.  That's 3 months of the year to try and make enough to trade FDs on. The other 9 months you're left dealing with degenerate deadbeats that haven't filed in 6 years and are tired of getting mail.
What‚Äôs your Venmo bitch
Small Dicks, stand erect please, I can‚Äôt see you
IT IS THE Charlie Munger effect, BABA +10% END OF THE DAY

Do they have a product yet?

Hey guys I can't afford any more FDs, should I start a vending machine business to finance my gambling addiction?
I miss Septembear all ready.
So 10/15 450 spy calls are somewhat safe ?
Spy 444 EOD
I was told it‚Äôs free up until 150 large or somethings but fuck if I know
Less fooked than you were yesterday
Is newegg still a thing?
Can I have some? I can even make a fake sad story if it makes you feel better
Who fell for the debt ceiling this year?
Upwards trend till mid sept when debt ceiling BS happens again. Buy deep OTM SPY puts Aug 15 $30 out 10/15
House is long term capppy gains
SPY just pulled a thanos and made all bears disappear
Anyone buying HYLN?
Gotcha. 152F here. warrant life is the way to go
So much green out there. Berz are fed and phat, but they're gonna go hibernate in the Caribbean with their winnings for a few weeks.
Or just live in a country where the profit is tax free if you have lived for 2 years in the house
Im going all in on MSFT earnings calls, 20% increase in lots of msft products with 0 competitors, that shit gonna DESTROY earnings like its msft's bitch
South park predicted the future when randy strangled winnie the pooh. Bers are ded
Well that was just uncalled for
Nah, fuck that
I just need my positions to go up a million dollars so I'll have a million dollars.
ROKU $420 EOD
Depending on your average I think we‚Äôll be ok
# Pro tip

If the value of your house has risen due to inflation when you sell it, begin day-trading options and the capital losses will offset your capital gains tax liability.
420A
TSM. I buy the dip when they drop to $110, ride it back up to $118 and sell before China threatens Taiwan again sending the stock back down to $110.
10/8 PDD 95 and 100 calls here loaded to the tits. I‚Äôm feeling at least a 40 bagger today
Hang Seng closed 3.07% &amp; they didn‚Äôt raise the debt ceiling. SPY EOD $450+
üêª are back on the menu boys
Good morning fellas
I think we all have to admit that even when tapering begin, SPY will probably stagnate until MSFT and AAPL destroy earnings over and over again for SPY to climb to new ath's all over again like the OG way
flat until earnings ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I don‚Äôt trust you or your abnormally smal DICK

How are SPY 10/15 440‚Äôs and 445‚Äôs lookin‚Äô? Am I fooked?
But only keeps giving forever.
As prior enlisted. To that I say get out and get a real job with actual pay ü§°
Let‚Äôs do some of that smart boy thinking again

There is 14-16 weeks in tax season 
With 2 days off a week I‚Äôll only have 14 weeks of work. 

Let‚Äôs say I work 40 hours 

40 x 14 = 560 hours of work 

560 x $18.50 = $10,360 before taxes üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 

wtf my dude I make 1k in bed with 2 buttons some nights


Found a good tax program I thought I was domed on not finding the right one for me , and some of the tax programs like turbo tax tax preparation software costs like $3,000+! 

Found one after a random ass YouTube video you know how hard it was to find a video of someone comparing multiple tax programs for tax preparers not for the tax payer ? üòÇ

Anyways the one I‚Äôm looking at is $495 

I rather spend my 560 hours finding 100 people and charge $100 per Return then working for pennies.

Lol sorry I‚Äôm just ranting I‚Äôm so desensitized to money now a days ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Are you saying it‚Äôs gonna continue up for a week and then drop til end of month
In two weeks
I‚Äôm loaded to the tits with 10/8 PDD and SPY calls. Today is going to be glorious
We buying apes again gang?

Thoughts on TSLA? My 805 FDs are almost dead. Thinking of selling at open to recoup what I can.
Zoom out on the 1 year chart
Knees weak, bags heavy. Moms spaghetti

Seems like UPST continues it's mars mission.
I don‚Äôt trust this SPY run up. I have been burned the last two weeks.
Man i can feel NASDAQ heading to 16,000 soon! It will be biblical
MOS?
Make the machines that make the chips. There's a chip shortage so ppl need more machines, they have an absolute monopoly on the market + huge dip

TLRY is gonna make me rich
LOGI seems oversold might buy some December calls
Eurobulls pushing the market. USbears will then crush it afterwards...

A premature birth that was four minutes late
$HOOD hasn't had shares available to borrow for weeks. When they do popup the fee is around 175%. Sometimes you'll see 1,000 available, but not for long. 

I know there's a good case for shorting this stock, but there is potential for calls to print in the next few weeks if Vlad keeps making improvements and bad PR dissipates. 

My calls for tomorrow are fucked unless Cathie buys a controlling interest in the company, but there is hope for  the coming weeks. Just make sure to get out before January lockup date.
Never bet against Dems on spy calls
Got a few 1/22 95c. I'd say 130 eoy but eom would be excellent

Go cash gang and wait for this to crack. Monetary policy is the only thing that can kill this bull
God no kidding lol
150$ in the last 5 minutes literally lmao TSLA!
just gotta ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4272)the![img](emote|t5_2th52|4272)and you are back in the green. To the Moon!
Lol I can‚Äôt fucking believe the tsla 1300c weeklies I bought this morning are paying off. Fucking ridiculous.
what was the total you put in?
What up last minute drills on my memes
235% on TSLA call options we rich
Tsla&gt; coke
Remember, remember the *1st* of November

it will, but it runs until december at least
SPY all time high
Pencils down.
#Just bought $CHPT and $COUR before EOD these are gonna fly tomorrow
I love some internet change
He says he sold way before, but it's still funny to make fun of him for being a TSLA üêª
Total legal spy pump into close
Pencils down folks
will my pltr calls going to be fuk?
Saw AMD and lost No Nut Nov
#Bought $Chpt and $COUR
Can Tesla stock be the reserve currency?
Naming my kid TSLA, he won‚Äôt be bullied right?
You could have said that about $1000.
$1200? You got bigger balls than me
$COIN has a future but glad I sold some today.
if the goal is financial stability, and this will push you there, do it.  No bullshit.  the less monthly you have to pay out, the quicker you can build that savings.
Do vertical put spreads , ATM verticals are $500 max loss for $500 profit , OTM verticals cost less than $500 to open. I did a 1200/1190 for fun , 500 profit if it hits. I'm fine with it to keep going up because it pumps the nasdaq so I can get a good entry to short it.
What's the move for tomorrow?
1300 tmrw as people flee other shit and buy tsla
Your delta is essentially the value of ur contract
Someone corrected me when I said the same thing.  Apparently he tweeted it and shows in his fillings.
Folks this is the guy that said FB, AMD will be down this week. Straight up ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
There can't possibly be any TSLA shorts remaining, right?
11/5 just bought it like 30 mins ago lol just to watch
That‚Äôs what people don‚Äôt want to hear
Elon swinging his green Martian dick again
You can do a put debit spread or call credit spread

up 100% on weekly Tsla FDS just bought over an hr ago, WTFFFFFF 10k profit
The SPY 9-day RSI has been overbought for like a week now, and even the 14-day is almost there at this point. 
  
ü§°
That feeling when you buy $50 otm puts and before the day is finished your have $110 otm puts
Lmao I have a 1400c almost up 100%
dude you don't just "get lucky" by shorting the housing market, also with GME he prob had a plan to sell at a certain price, not at $400. he prob made millions anyway
Mother of pumps
Is burry getting squeezed?
AMD goes up after I sell. I hate it here
According to max pain, puts outnumber calls this week over 3:1
NVDA and AMD take me away
Tsla +100 today
Opened call creds on TSLA for the week. Don't go to $1300 too quick TSLA!
probably should have taken that double.
Get ready to lose those earnings.
Damn mid caps go brrrrrr
TSLA is now the dominant specie on earth.
Bro what's happening with TSLA
imagine buying tesla puts or shorting it hahahaha
So much for 2 weeks lol. How those balls doing, buddy?
If I had just bought those fucking TSLA calls at open..
This market is more frothy than feb21 this year and fed still not gonna rise rates?

Fuck this shyt
you belong here, jk could print depending when they expire and the break even price
Premium will fuck a lot of people buying now.
At the end of the year:   Anyone remember the great TSLA crash of 11/1/21 from 1pm to 2pm, lost nearly 20 points....never dipped again.
TSLA daily rsi at 95. Literally has never been this high before
gonna print
I have faith in AMC
Trap
I would love to short TSLA right here. Too bad I bet a single put costs a fortune
That‚Äôs what I thought about my 1300c‚Äôs when I bought them this morning.
Since forever I have the feeling TSLA is gonna correct itself but it kinda turned into an infinite bubble...
Lol what‚Äôs the expiry?
1200 wasn't a wall, it was a fucking launch pad
Lol except he won't he gonna buy 10 houses instead
Please elon, save my portfolio 

Bezos fucked me last week on amazon calls
Pick a side SPY!
So are all these tech gains getting wiped out when tapering starts this week?
Come on 1450 üòÇ
Imagine not holding any TSLA calls right now
BBüçáüöÄ safe moonüßê
Lmao why is everything mooning
Doesnt matter. Sell tomorrow when IV gets juiced
Same lol c‚Äômon 2000
I misplayed tesla run today.
[deleted]
This is like nothing I‚Äôve ever seen‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm watching a fucking cow fly by my window. That would actually be more believable lol
Alright got my SPY puts for tomorrow. Should be juicy
He isn't short TSLA anymore.
Not until I FOMO in
[deleted]
Every tsla crash has been followed by a even bigger rise
We goes uppies
tsla paying me well today
5k at 10$ never selling
Lol you ain't kidding. Guess i hold this til Friday when it hits 2k and somehow i close at +1500%
my little 1800 TSLA call has nearly doubled
I see the TSLA bears have found the downvote button. Don't care. Profit worth more than karma.
He said he wasn‚Äôt shorting it over a week ago, which means he closed his position probably end of September.  He‚Äôs probably establishing a new short position this week into this insane FOMO AFTER a 50% monthly runup.
That‚Äôs‚Ä¶. what I said. He got lucky shorting the housing market. And he sold his GME in Q4 of 2020, well before it went anywhere near triple digits let alone $400+.
Tesla is good for you
Don't think anyone is holding decent amount of TSLA puts, it's just that the new investors are scared that they are gonna miss the chance, so ends up adding the fuel
Ridiculously otm tesla call is bought I want to be apart of this wild ride again
I hope this BA run is forreal and it isn't trying to cuck me for the 100th time!
Gee bus Tesla.
Ocugen gonna have a good day on Wednesday. Get in ahead of time
Yes. The delta climbs. The deeper ITM a stock gets, the more intrinsic value it gains, thus, for every $1 the stock goes up, you'll get closer to $1 increase in the option.

This is what delta "measures".  


EDIT: For calls options. Obviously it's negative for puts.
$500k into 100 m&amp;m's? Leave this to me üòé
Irrational exuberance
[deleted]
It‚Äôs frothy, just trading on momentum. I‚Äôm on the sidelines and there‚Äôs just no entry point‚Ä¶
if I had a TSLA share for every political txt message I got this weekend...
This is bananas üçå
How will that even remotely affect tsla at this point
Wow these mfers are trying so hard to keep Amazon above 3311
Got no stake in it but wow good decision TSLA bulls
I'm poor so I had to get a cheaper option. TSLA 1500 by Friday can't happen right? Right?
Are you fuckin kidding me üò≠ü§£
I just used my TSLA earnings to short TSLA I‚Äôm scared
[deleted]
I think it's unrealized gains
what about pooping in the urinals
He does good analysis, very thorough, and it wasn‚Äôt luck. His issue is that he has no sense of time for the market, he makes correct points, just overestimates their impact compared with sentiment. Sentiment will bowl over fundamentals every time.
i just fucking KNOW the moment i buy it will tank. thats why im sitting on the sidelines forever
GME don‚Äôt you tell me I bought your top too
Im selling my TSLA to pay off my Toyota lmao
I just can't bet against TSLA. I think some Jan2022 DIS 180 calls will have to suffice.
Yup, gamma drives delta up and gamma is always positive for long options.
Holy fuck Elon is a god.
imagine shorting TSLA not realizing its a trillion dollar market cap meme
RIP TSLA shorts, I actually feel for you.
Elon taking us to the Unga bunga zone (aka mars)
Feels bad man. I got $700 puts for February 2022 this morning and they‚Äôre up 10% from my buy in.
Burry is a cuck. Thank you.
TSLA 1300 at open

Bough my coin calls EOD, got a bit of a discount. Am very excited
I can roll it to next week and still have like 5,000 in profits if I switch to a 1200 strike
TSLA the absolute unit has saved my portfolio
I bought SNAP low but not low enough, where the bulls at?
BAN
[deleted]
TDOC is up 830% in the past 5 years and the company has over 300% in rev growth over the past 3 years in a breakthrough sector that hasnt really even began. God some of you are such morons.

Winners dont go straight up.

tdoc is a future beast.

shit stock though because it got beat up like every other growth stock this year. got it

keep on chasing kiddo
Tesla adding a cool $400B to their market cap in less than a week.

Very cool very real.

No bubble here folks, move along.
Just use turbotax

Fed's balance sheet dumping into TSLA, market cap 8 trillion incoming

VLTA new GME yes?
Yes
Holy Shit Elon
i keep doing inverse condors, close out the calls when profit and roll to a new inverse condor, and letting puts ride... working well so far, jus gonna work it till it doesnt
Fuck my life, why didn‚Äôt I stick to the plan and YOLO on TSLA this morning?

At least the MSFT calls I bought at the low are up a little üò´
the only reason the crowd hasn‚Äôt turned on me like my boy u/Cashflow_ is I haven‚Äôt gone bear. 

The crowd is fickle. They care not for the legendary volume of *absolute* **god tier** shitposting I and my associates contribute. They only want blood ü©∏.

I want my banbet congratulations motherfucker!
Ima bout to buy a retarded  Tesla call
I‚Äôm fukkin holding over here‚Ä¶..but I‚Äôve been blasted over the past month with this stock.

When moon?
Broke through 1200 like nothing
Tesla cant keep getting away with this.
My cash account is as flat as my wife‚Äôs ass
TSLA eventually going to consolidate at a higher high, watch out for the first drop, it‚Äôs a doozy
I bought them at 87$ a pop now worth over 100$
I'll see you at the starting line when the midnight candle is lit and the bears are out to play with your loose anus
Yes
"surely 1200 is the top"
msft or tsla calls at close
I had some poots this morning and they weren‚Äôt moving as well as calls
Elon just made enough to eradicate world hunger four times today. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Double bottom base.

It's common and there was a severe event (entain)
I‚Äôm pretty sure burry covered his positions and made a handsome profit. Someone else is holding his bags.
Alright this shit is gonna go haywire now. Broke $1200. Had to buy 34 fractional shares at least. Can't afford real shares lol

I just bought one of those new MacBooks so we should see that reflected in the stock price soon
TSLA gonna be the most valuable company in the world based solely on hype
lol so overbought
does your delta climb as your call gets more itm, even after you purchased it with a low delta and otm?
No. You pretty much nailed it.

You forgot that there is a 7-12 month wait list on any Tesla right now. So it'll he a long time before Hertz gets their cars, or even has to pay for them.
right now nothing but CCJ in the past
There's for sure gonna be another tsla split right? Like we're trading at pre split peak levels and it doesn't seem to be slowing down.
Ahhhh. Ha
Vuziiiiiiiii
Not TSLA
Read my edit, TDOC is a shit stock so obviously doesn't apply there
I'd like to thank all the 19 year olds , and older morons pumping GME. without you I couldnt get this sweet premium.
any news on why it tanked today? or just overall shit tanking

You could always buy further otm ones but I get the feeling
You are right. I learned long ago that good investors add to their best performers. 
It‚Äôs what I have done for many years and has paid very well. 

There is this stupid obsession with ‚ÄúDollar cost averaging‚Äù which is just another way to say ‚Äúbuy more of my failing trades‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm not saying always but at ATH, but don‚Äôt be afraid to invest in companies that are making big gains. Those are the winners.
Powell won‚Äôt let us down. the USD will be backed by Tesla stock. But I only believe that because I‚Äôm a retard
You can't call him wrong because the entire game has changed. There's nothing fundamental about it anymore. The FED props everything up, apps like Robinhood have made the markets accessible to every idiot with $5 and the dream that stocks only go up, and that's it. It's a self-perpetuating system.
After hours top play what is it? Earnings?
TSLA fucking did it 1200 baby
start accumulating long dates miner calls when they dip and fawget about et
Agreed. Time will tell!
Imagine if Tesla splits every year
I see. Is there a story about him quitting the position? thx for letting me know
So who FOMOd into üçÑstonks at the top today? üôã
SNAP
Dang it did it...1200 was breached
Tesla Tesla splitting again next week
Ban bets won all around!!!
Called TSLA 1200 incoming earlier lol TSLA bulls we banking again :)
Ain't it great?
Tsla moving like this dude‚Äôs mouth between my legs
I know. But it's my only call. Wish I would have bought two I definitely would have sold one of them already
No its not. If you bought TDOC in 120s youre in for a triple bagger.

You think a stock that ran 70% in a year is better off than the one down 70%?

Runners will be losers in the next market rotation to build a stronger higher low base. Thats when you step in to buy. Get out of here with that nonsense.
Tesla is absolutely ridiculous. The scale of the valuation changes now are totally unprecedented.
That would be fine with me, but it won‚Äôt cause apple is shit.
this man lives in Spain.

Is everything up today going to reverse tomorrow?
Because it‚Äôs the best
I‚Äôve seen this before. TSLA calls for the rest of the week lmao
If only I sold my GME in January. Had 80k and just watched it go down from there. All the trades I‚Äôd make today would‚Äôve made me millions just no funds to trade with
What Uranium play are you most bullish on?

It‚Äôs been consolidating for a while before ER, and then good ER plus Hertz orders just sent it. We bulls are hungry.
AFRM calls looking pretty tasty right now
TSLA $1300 EOW
NET puts
Said that for 5 years
He got out a long time ago
If Rivian is woeth 60 bil LCID is easily worth 100+ bil. So yeah, LCID could see 70+ even
Because I'm poor, I couldn't get the calls this morning in TSLA that I wanted. No worries, went out to the cheaper ones and snagged a 11/5 1250 for $9.80. It's now $20. IV crush isn't too bad as long as TSLA pops some in the AM.
Tesla movement reminiscent of 2019 run up and subsequent crash
God I would splooge everywhere
if your company isn't growing $100B every day what are you even doing
Give us the current price too dude

So I'm fairly new to trading, I usually go for slow consistent gains. Where can I go to learn how to read all the mumbo-jumbo that's in alot of the DD? I want to smooth out what ripples I got left.
TSLA is too high, has to come back down, all in on Puts....overheard while handing out soup to the homeless.
Tesla calls are up and my Tesla puts are up as well. Musk, the Legend. Praise be
Watch SPY shoot up AH after closing under 460 today
Good day for GME. Looking forward to tomorrow
What earnings play
Ah, i see youre a fan of Nikola
So, when do I sell this 1100c that expires Friday... I bought last week for 13.74?  Edit. @ 109.25 now
I‚Äôm so happy I bought Tesla when it was still solar city.
Could someone just explain in stupid terms why TSLA is on the rise? Did Elon finally get a taste of that sugar crisp?

Cucknose bitch
It's actually true tho, I've gotten that tip from professional day traders and when you think about it, it makes sense

The key is to look for good/mature companies, not new meme stocks that just ran up 400%
TSLA will close at 1m gain of 420.69
Fuck it let‚Äôs hold some 1250 calls overnight. See what happens
We should start an ev company pre-revenue ipo at 100 billion. Every wsb member pre-orders one of our fake ev cars and keep the scam running for a year or two.

Same thing DFV saw last year happening again. Too many option contracts (including ETFs that contain GME) overlapping with FTD dates. Cult following. Free money. 

Today bounced off the 120 EMA back into the long term trend.
Dude for the love of god take the money.
Waiting till Fed meeting to see if we are going to have a wind-out-of-sails moment which is which I‚Äôm going to buy into a bunch of shares and leaps.

Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

Nope, but it's high likelihood of profit.

Havent played this game for a bit - but just bought TSLA PUT 1100 Nov 19. Gonna be fun
TSLA's over 1T market cap but still going up like a small cap.

So many millionaires minted by TSLA. And lots of bankrupt bears.
You‚Äôre being played. When guys like scarramucci show up on CNBC and start telling Tesla shorts to get out of the way and buy is the last signal to question what‚Äôs going on.
That is awesome! Now I know why Ford going to $20 This week
We‚Äôre all waiting for a split?

Pro tip when yoloing into a stock:

Don't think twice about yoloing into a good company that is at or near ATH.  No bagholders = no one looking to offload bags at the nearest uptick.  This is why whenever people try to catch a falling knife, it usually doesn't work out.  Many bagholders = price suppression on any uptick as bagholders look to move on.  PLTR and CRSR are 2 examples of stocks that got stuck in this shitty loop.  Neither can maintain a sustained uptick because bagholders are unloading at high volume any time stock moves up to their break-even point

tl;dr Buy AMD now!!!  That's an order!!!

P.S. Not financial advice

Honestly I was going through some shitty times for the last few months (highly correlated with my portfolio, but also irl stuff going on) and it was easy to talk shit to ppl and troll, now my port is up and I‚Äôm feeling like how I was behaving was not acceptable. And I‚Äôm gonna stay true to my values regardless of how my portfolio is looking going forward and regardless of personal problems. It‚Äôs one thing to make a joke here and there but to lay into someone repeatedly is just lame and I‚Äôm gonna do better.
another day another 100B added to TSLA market cap
What we doing with LCID bois?
VLTA below all analysts price targets, ~1.5bn market cap. Good EV play. Loaded on some calls.
Let it ride one more day is my input. I have also been known to ride 10 baggers to 0 tho so idk

I'm happy for y'all TSLA bulls. I hope it helps you achieve the financial freedom you need to retire early, get out of debt, buy your first home, go (back) to school, whatever. I'm just happy for y'all.
Tesla $1200 before close

Ath is 128 you sped
im afraid it will tank earnings too regardless if it gets better because it's "already counted in" the price

i think i will drop my leveraged shares and rejoin after earning (which totally mean you should do the exact opposite because that's how my luck works :) )
fuck it, 1300c sent

The gains are great, but watching people REEEEEE about the value is even better
By fucking over the broke boys with less than 25k? Yeah absolutely.
I hope so, I got leaps
Spy 460+ close
Get fucked tsla bulls, I just FOMOd a far OTM call expiring Friday. This shit is tanking now.

Booooo
spy +4% tomorrow üöÄ
Do you guys ever let a 0dte expire worthless just to avoid a day trade. Bought some $458 puts today. Only worth $2 now. Not worth a day trade. That's how theta gang really wins
ü¶çüçå
if inflation is out of control shouldnt GLD be running alongside it? Is it not because the play is too obvious? If so, I will double down until these calls expire worthless. Try me market - I didn't even like that money anyways.
Come on GME, one final run into close
Odds are the tomorrow‚Äôs headlines start with ‚ÄúStock shake off Fed‚Äôs...‚Äù?
don‚Äôt u fucking do it
Don‚Äôt think that way it‚Äôs better to get gains then keep being greedy and then the drop happens and THETA destorys ur call options.
When TSLA explodes, I will be there to witness it
Lol it‚Äôs okay. There‚Äôs always next play.
TSLA continues to baffle me. I remember when it was like $250(before Split) a few years ago and I thought it was overvalued
üò´üò´
Actually. This might really be a gamma squeeze. Transitory.
I bought a TSLA 1/21/22 $550 C last November with the plan of holding it for a year. Now I‚Äôm considering holding it to see if it splits.
It IPOd? Huh, I didn't even know. What's your PT?
can NVDA become the next TSLA? I would like to see 20x returns in a single year from holding their stock
true cus i need to recoup
Shit's 'tarded right now.
Yeah that‚Äôs true . This community definitely can get carried away and I‚Äôm guilty for sure..
I did, and am thinking about selling before close
thank god i held on my TSLA calls this shit really don‚Äôt miss
TSLA will hit $1200+ after hours then $1300 next tomorrow. Then stock split announcement then $1400+ ü§ë
Yeah, meant sell tomorrow before the bs. Thinking of jumping ship in ten minutes though. Can't risk getting too close to the fire
I‚Äôd cream my corn if that were to happen in the next 20 minutes
I have had enough gain. Should be stop gambling

Sure, it hit 200 but can it retain 200+ for a week.

Its down to 199.59 again

Yeah so what‚Äôs the big runner after hours tonight that no one is mentioning rn
Is AMC earnings this week or on the 9th? I need to know when to buy Puts and difference sources are saying different things.
Bought in for a Short F call to 18 by EoW.

I have no stake in Tesla and have never invested or shorted it.

But still, watching it go up like this makes me so angry, lol. It's so fucking stupid lmao. All I can think when I look at it is how many dumbasses there are in the world.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I like it when IBKR tries to give a reason for why TSLA shares are trading higher today
Palantir earnings aheadüòè
Tesla prints.
It‚Äôs 1.5%. Apple is 4x heavier, that old sack of gold in a bag of lead.
no, just a rotation from the "everything else" sector into the "Tesla" sector.
Am I doing bad. Please educate me, I just wanna yolo some bags on Tesla with the cool kids
Scared? If you have large account, I‚Äôd hold. If your still building up your account, I‚Äôd take profit. Yes, TSLA has been strong lately and is likely to go higher, but gains are gains.
TSLA 1200 puts expiring Friday are tempting...
I see \~1.44%
TSLA feels governmentish.
This market gives me the BG‚Äôs

Anyone holding TSLA calls overnight?
If I placed my tesla call around 1130 and haven‚Äôt gotten it yet is there any chance I get it before close?
Long enough time frame it might work out

I grabbed 1300c for 11/5 in like the middle of the day and I'm up 90%. I'm scared and very erect.
Damn. Been awhile since I got a 4 digit ass whooping on a position. Fucking Tesla got me. I said fuck it and rolled up and out. Jan 22 1190 puts.
Dunno their cars are crap.
I think as soon as TSLA hits 1200 we are gonna see a pullback

TSLA can‚Äôt go up every day. If you buy now you deserve to be homeless
How so, why don't you go look at recent fines levied against both of those corporations.

It's extensive. How can you deny what's legally been proven? And happening in the open. 

Did you look at the picture? Retail doesn't have access to those exchanges
Good luck! It might gap up tomorrow

Did you look at the chart? Normal people don't even have access to those exchanges.

You really think retail traders just block sold 20 blocks of 100 share batches simultaneously at the same price????
Ok. 1 OTM Tesla put for 11/12. Up 53% in a month going into Fomc with entire market at all time highs.  Clean energy part of Bill probably won‚Äôt end up passing either.  Might as well gamble here as it nears 1200 on 1.8$/share earnings.

1250 let‚Äôs roll!!!

200 to 3k is pretty sweet. What were you betting?
RKT super undervalued. Gonna crush earnings boiiiii.
Just looking at TSLA chart zoomed out, this massive massive pump has almost no volume behind it relative to its past jumps in price.
Yuck. I'd never buy such a shit car. 

Sold my TSLA and threw it all on F.

Chiefs should win bigly, so of course they won‚Äôt.
I sold my tesla shares to buy more tesla shares. I somehow ended up with less shares than I started with. Help.

woah man....woah
Goin short TSLA.... pray for me...
Nah bro, I think I'm going to take my $1350 calls and my +95% and get out.  this too high too quick.
Holy shit, finally I regret to sell tsla too early
I‚Äôm holding till Thursday
It's followed a reliable pattern for the last two weeks, daily, but is still pretty spooky to time if you want to swing trade it.
Tesla is fucken insane
My non memes are +5%
Bro Tesla what the fuck!!!! This is insane

If only I wasn‚Äôt a pussy and bought a bunch of calls instead of shares at 750 I would be a fucking millionaire
If I did anything else, would I even be allowed to call myself a retard? üòú
see that's the thing, i have a feeling you're right so i don't really wanna fomo into this thing, just wanna get a general idea of what's going on

Like shit do I take my paltry profit on Tesla or do I just hold this bitch through the night? $1350 11/5

Edit: held on - it doubled
I bought some OTM TSLA puts at the top this morning and they barely printed. I then bought 1400 calls and they are printing way harder. Shit is rigged against the bears

Tesla. My God.
You'll be able to charge your car at home üè° that's all ima say. Everything is going electric soon. Tesla will be 100k per share in the next 5 to 10 years

This is retarded
I thought that end of last week but apparently I‚Äôm a fucking idiot.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkanjp/daily_discussion_thread_for_november_01_2021/hiwxkts/

if you guys took 11/5 calls here on TSLA you'd be up nicely. $1.76 &gt; $3.40 and going
sell right before close then buy tomorrow morning's dip within the first half hour or 45 min or so of open
thetagang is just echo boomers
Tesla puts are like touching an electric fence - you know it‚Äôs gonna go bad but you gotta try it once
threw extra 10k on tsla fds on that dip earlier, up 75%
If you ask or take photos, you sell
Tsla puts right? RIGHT?!
But will there be buyers if the spread is being sold at the maximum possible profit?

Da fuq are you in
LOL this gave me a good laugh at least. I'm the other guy that thinks we are due for a correction but did not sell yet and up 80% on those options. Don't worry though 80% of my portfolio is AMZN so I'm down 25% today.
Just me, I would sell.  But I was wrong once before
The thetagang sub is so cringe. It‚Äôs all a bunch of poors getting rekt trying to wheel super high IV stocks because that‚Äôs the only way you can make decent returns with a small port. Pro tip: if your account is less than $500k you‚Äôre not thetagang material just buy SPY calls and make 10x more money than writing contracts
I bought a single TSLA put today. Lost my beer money for the month in 10 minutes.
Disagree. Burry is more successful than 99.9999% of WSB. Obviously the dude closed his position for a gain. People just mad because he bet against the target of their simping affection.
I need SKLZ to get to 30
I don‚Äôt know if I should keep my Tesla calls until tomorrow morning, or just be happy with my profits.
Hell yeah retard same one lets fucking go
Let them expire
Anyone else yoloing BP calls?
1300 eow
Tesla is insanity.  I can‚Äôt believe it is still running up.
When you see JBLU up 4% today, do you get 4% FOMO, or 20% upside ahead?
I wanna see some good TSLA bear loss porn tonight
[deleted]
I dunno what you're getting at. Sure RH doesn't let you ride to expiry but even if it forces him to sell 1 hour before expiriry he still gets his gains
I‚Äôve been holding a TSLA call for almost a year now. January~May was brutal, rn is so satisfying
elongated muskrat
&gt; I would sell it.
Some people just want to watch money burn
Tesla please god don‚Äôt stop it feels too good.
So real talk. I've got a 1130 call for Friday I bought last week. It's up about 175%. If you're me are you selling at close or riding a day or two more?
I'm about to make 20k off of 87$ this is fucking insane lfg tesla. 1475 calls üìû fucking printing rn 11/5
Dude, I am closing in on 8 figures.  Don‚Äôt worry about me, I‚Äôm good
I‚Äôm trying a long shot hopefully they will announce a split soon .

Real question: Is everyone just tossing their TSLA profits into GME?
TSLA gonna ruin us all one day lmao

Types your most scandalous TSLA PT &amp; be assured it will come true üòé
Yeah and as soon as I do my portfolio takes a dump. Nice try tho
The TESLA gain posts make me think we are due for a correction. However, I am a little scared to make that bet. JK. I made that bet and am down 25% today. Looking for some more crayons for a snack.
They went to sleep a few weeks ago. See them in spring.
&gt; I would close them out.
Also Amazon, Zoox autonomous blobs company
Yeah but I‚Äôm gonna keep holding it for fun. I have most in shares . Holding 35 shares of Tesla.
you also have to figure in theta decay.  The farther out you purchase the contracts the more premium gets charged.  Holding them through expiration sees theta decay of the premium to zero.  So, if the underlying security goes up a lot, you make money.  It it goes down, stays the same or just goes up a little bit, you lose. 

edit: Implied volatility also affects the premium as well, so if you buy during high IV and sell during low, you're going to lose money on IV.
Friend has a few debit spreads in TSLA 990/1000 C 11/19. 

He is deep ITM but it's on RH. I don't want him to lose it. Is it recommended to close your deep ITM spreads or let them ride? 
He has 17 spreads.

Citadel is long Tesla, he's saying pumping Tesla would give them more collateral but they'd miss out on some of the option premium.  If they could keep Tesla a little flatter, they'd probably do it halfheartedly, like putting all its support bras on the bottom shelf.

I have a feeling tesla will be my first 10 bagger just off of 87$ lmao this is fucking nuts
It's sort of funny that tsla was hilariously overpriced like 6 months ago, and it's up like 80% since then.

Tesla is the one stock that constantly reminds me that we are in an epic bubble, and it's the sole reason I always hold some puts on the indexes.
The answer is always yes, except when it's no

Google shows no market cap or PE

Fidelity shows 1.15 billion market cap and no PE.
I no longer find it unbelievable that TSLA could rally to 1500. I was wrong.

#Just an FYI that last time $TSLA announced a stock split it was around $1370. It was a 5-1 stock split. Stock is currently $1180. Getting closed. Also means the stock is up almost 5x since Aug 11 when they made the announcement.

I also know as soon as I sell my calls for 65% loss, it's going to shoot up $100+
The fact that theres TSLA bers out there still trying to profit off their shorts/puts on this company is so fascinating to me.
Yeah but baby lucid will need a diaper change
Extrinsic value on options adds more profit (or loss) based on volatility.  High volatility may be pricing in a higher price by expiration than the current price making it more valuable.  If you exercise you lose extrinsic value.  
Check optionsprofitcalculator.com to see how extrinsic value fades as strike date gets closer.
what do you think MVIS? since small caps are to going to print hard this month
Fuck it, I bought Sofi weeklies. Sorry everyone
Tesla q beast

At least I have some exposure with it through ark k and my other index fund
Watch the 1545 daytrading sell off on TSLA then recock
yes, mostly, it's called intrinsic value. at expiration price of option collapses to intrinsic value.
Exactly my point

Once you're that rich, literally nothing will give you a dopamine spike.  I'd wager Gates was eating human meat for the thrills back when he was worth five billion.  Dude probably couldn't create dopamine or serotonin if he tried.

Buying shares is safer. But buying 100 shares is expensive. 

With that same money, you might be able to buy 20 contracts instead of 1 contract. Then get 20x the profit. 

But like I said, much much much more risk.
I would short TSLA but I like money!

You can tell Citadel is finally letting Tesla calls print because the worse option is they let Tesla trade flat and than get margin called on GME.

How are you not processing the idea that a market collapse or a government collapse in Brazil would affect the stock price of this company?

You have no legitimate counterpoints, you are just going to ad hominem attacks to try and discredit my points by bringing in completely irrelevant falsehoods (I did not invest in GME, amc or bb nor did I join this sub in January).

Regardless, carry on good sir. I feel like you have enough to worry about rather than being angry at someone online
Trading has definitely caused a downtrend in my impulsive Amazon purchases.
You contract is up $3 lol.  Was stupid to buy any calls that far OtM.  No options are even up 100% on a 5% day lol
I think the US Gov has to have multiple providers, so even if SpaceX is the best value, they still have to award contracts to other launch providers. And until SpaceX gets the Starship working then they have very real competition from these smaller companies. RKLB not bad at all, I might jump in again but just watching for now.

Lol you sound like a clown. Company has been around since 2004. You‚Äôre hating on South America? I made a fucking small fortune on Mercado Libre. Stick to GME and AMC ü§°
I fucking hate TSM. What a bag of shit this stock is.

nobody really cares dude, it's not that anyone profoundly doubts GME it's just why sit around waiting for a pop on one specific stock when there is money to be made all around, every single day?
When SOFI was up 9% this morning, I sold 60 shares and bought some OTM covered calls, assuming it would come back.  I think I am the reason its so determined to crush.

I made one trade on GME back in Jan for an easy $2500.  I then ran away like it was radioactive and I lose no sleep.  GME is dead to me.
Best bet would be to watch closely and make a choice based on movement? Hypothetically
same. I made like 50k in january off GME, i wont let emotions stop me from making money but fucking apes are annoying as shit.
So my theory is this. Cash gang market crash shillers are jumping back in now as the fomo was too great and got the better of them? It must have been hard sitting on that cash and having to fucking shill market crash theories all day and not trade?

If you‚Äôre up a lot you can take your original investment and some profits and let the rest ride

DKNG is going to have a good earnings report on Friday. As a degenerate I have been using the site for some time. The amount of users has significantly increased recently on promos and other pools compared to the past. I used o normally finish in the top 5,000 for money wagered on certain promos. I bet the same as always and don't even crack the top 10,000.
Puts on $Z already up 20% and strong chance they absolutely rip after poor earnings tomorrow
The time is now old man

Makes sense though, the eclectic components take up a lot of space, and the Ranger is already a slimmed down version.  I have a new Ranger and I love it, however there is no space in it that I'm willing to sacrifice for it being electric.  It will take time, but they will find a way.

Supply and demand seems pretty fundamental but idk
&gt; It is a fact that the price of NET will go to $0.00 in 1 year
Imagine a market that drops by .1% so infrequently that it's a noteworthy event
At the risk of sounding repetitive here, but SPY is red so I'm buying 2 day calls.
Come on SQ time to move. That‚Äôs enough time bouncing off 254$.
Haha. I bought a put right there. Up 30% so far, not sure if I hold ON with the master Twitter manipulator around though.
Cringe ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)

FD still good for gold? Or long term? I feel like I'm playing with fire holding calls that expires a week before earnings, but I know fuck all anyways

Yes
okay, actually, maybe some of this mega cap slide is due to pricing in of new global minimum tax rates.

in absence of other news, that is my explanation, because this move, particularly in GOOG, is no longer within expected variation after earnings

firms with overseas avoided taxes should face a pull back to price in hit to EPS

It gets it next month or beginning of 2022 and hits $50+ after it hits $30 after a blowout ER next week. It‚Äôs eminent.

Pullback sure. I read some articles a few days ago though that most consumers have been trained to be lazy as fuck by all the "at home" stuff now. Like most people who no longer fear Covid still have their groceries delivered just because they don't want to give up the convenience. 

If I had to guess, it will pull back a bit but nowhere near pre-pandemic level. Too many people are hooked now.

Facewhat?
DWAC not looking so hot, so much for pump
TSLA and GME behave similarly. My theory is that in both cases, supply for shares is locked up in retail investors who refuse to sell. As a result, whenever there is incremental demand, this shit shoots up. 

No matter what, no one sells their TSLA shares. Any sort of short covering or anything thus fucks the price up. 

Eventually maybe years down the line, they‚Äôll miss earnings or growth forecasts and this shit will come cratering down as retail investors baghold and eventually sell. 


But for now, this shit is the new US T bill.

this is an asshole thing to say. TSLA isn't america - sure, gains are gains but lets be perfectly honest. The gains from from squeezing and ass blasting short positions not from actual value. The idea that TSLA is worth as much as amazon or apple is ludicrous. Sure, he shoulve known better than to go short on TSLA, but in the long run TSLA will be a part of nuking the market when the music stops.

Okay, so I've been watching $PAYS for several weeks. This stock has tons of potential to me but no one on Reddit is talking about it. It's business was DIRECTLY affected by covid (plasma donation business). Their Q3 is on the 3rd. And now the stock is rising (insiders?).

You can get a taste of that now if you want dude. Be a bartender at a mexican restaurant on weekends or sth.

imo it's actually better to just be a bartender than to be an owner. If your bar stops attracting a crowd, the owner just has to stare at the electricity bill with no customers around, whereas the bartender gets to get a new job at a cool new bar

Thank you for the confirmation bias I needed for my SPY puts.
true but also, stop being poor
The delta is discontinuous at the maturity date, that's why the effect is explosive when suddenly the stock moves against you, which is exactly what happened last Friday when suddenly the $1100C's became ITM.
is there a good entry point on anything today?? everything's run already hard to get in when something is up 10+% lmao

261!? hah
!banbet Ford $20 4d
I think I may have finally read a chart right....very little resistance on $F today.
It‚Äôs difficult for us to buy stocks not knowing what they do
GME ran up $20 on 3 mil volume and than dropped $10 on 70k volume. 

Fucking crime, if you ever had any doubts shorts have not closed, here's your sign.
Tesla added 300 B in market cap in the past 5 days.. for what exactly? No way its just the hertz deal
I agree with the people who have scum ass bosses getting them to come in last minute on days off for shit pay tbh. 

If you can afford to tell your boss to suck your cock because you can get better work then do it.

Some people there def just crazy whiners tho. I don‚Äôt disagree with the sentiment as a whole though. Pay me my money, I do my job, and we both fuck off at the end of the day.

so is this the last hurrah before jpow takes away the punchbowl on wednesday, or do we meme to SPY 500 before eoy?
That's one way to look at it and the recent surge of commodities supports your theory (although the Dollar Index hasn't moved much, it just indicates that other central banks are also similarly printing money).

But I think it's still not enough to explain such a huge jump. After all, the dollar has been devaluing at an accelerated pace since March 2020.

I‚Äôm going to need spy to jump to 261 immediately so that my calls can recover from that dip
SPY puts at 460 earlier when it clearly couldn‚Äôt make it through was an easy call. Less sure about whether I should hold them now though. Suppose I‚Äôll just put a stop on at breakeven and see what happens. 11/5 460p
And just like that, a retard is born.

$TSLA's implied volatility is still below the average during the first half of 2021, expect calls to continue to make gains even on no movement as the IV continues to spike.
SPG earnings after close today... gonna be good.
And here I thought V was gonna start recovering today, looks like I was wrong
Ok pal
so tesla is a 2 Trillion Dollar company by christmas right?
Sup
So we‚Äôre betting on betting

GME calls for aid in the battle for 200 
For the olden times come meet their call!
Its gonna go to 420 again thanks to you
too late old man
He called it Alice in Wonderland this am
Why?
They always do in every year and the earnings aren't that extraordinary to warrant a 7% run in a month.

Derivatives are driving the market, the underlyings aren't, that's the only rationale I can come up with.

How about counterbets to banbets? Like if someone does a banbet and another person nerd against it, with its own wsb access on the line. Or maybe even the same thing, but with Reddit coins, two people bet on a stock reaching a level for x coins

I guess that's why stop limits exist. Breaking even isn't the worst case.

Seen this before. It‚Äôs never accurate. Yes the stock can go up or down; just like any other day. But again I think it‚Äôs a long term good hold. Look at the charts. Starting with nearly 6.5% green right off the bat essentially makes it even sweeter
...its a casino?

it‚Äôs all connected, but yeah one would assume that pedophile slave owners shouldn‚Äôt own any stocks

Just sold my CRSR 25c I bought at open for 30% profit. I don't see a blowout happening honestly and I've gotten burned by them once anyway. DDR5 prices are higher than people expected and I don't feel like with the chip shortages that people will be making new builds.

AFRM doesn't need to be bailed out
Bulls got so trapped, puts are so cheap right now

How SPY gonna betray me like this.

TSLA somehow has channeled all the LCID hype and absorbed it into itself
Farting in this dude‚Äôs face while he‚Äôs working me between my legs
Bitch will keep running too.
when tesla inevitably hits a sell-off wave, buy tf out that dip make that shit a V

TSLA went up a whole COINBASE today
Did a hedge fund get annihilated? What is all this green I‚Äôm seeing making my meme stonk bags lighter?
Tesla repeat from last year?
Lol get fukt
**TSLA ticks down 6 dollars from high**

I will never financially recover from this
Bears are winning üòÄ n other tickers
I got far otm tesla puts when it was at 1174.

I sold my puts for 20% profit when it was at 1189...

Yeah, IV is that high on tesla.
"it's a $20 stock"
Tesla has made me 34k in the last 2 hours....and I'm still down thanks to apple
GME is the new GME üß†
Gme is the one true stonk
haha buckfutters
IV went woooooooop
OCGN being all sneaky and shit with that outlier long red tail tryna trigger stop losses.
Spy puts must be fucking retarded here‚Ä¶ all in
About a measly $300 per contract
SPY puts and FB calls
##Is there anything that isn‚Äôt pumping right now? Lmao bears are swan diving off the tallest building they have access to right now.
That's right its rated out perform
215eod
The World Food Organization should just buy Tesla Calls to solve world hunger.
If you listen closely you can hear all of WSB losing No Nut November thanks to TSLA

Well except for the üåàüêª

Try Airgas store
Bought GME top, sorry I dropped it. I‚Äôll let you know when I‚Äôm selling so you can get back in
 One on OCGN, no stopping til $25
Tsla has made me 34k in the last two weeks. I was down 11k on my investment at one point! I love you Elon
any fomo into nvax - is this bitch gonna break 200 by eow
3rd
Pornhub has to go public.  Imagine puts printing every November?
I sold my 35c for Jan 2022 that I've been holding almost all year. Was down 70% at one point but sold last week for just 5% loss. I had thought I lost that money but man am I happy to exit thanks to the EV craze. Long term I still think it's a great play but I'm stepping away for now.
ü§û
Another day of ghey bears getting absolutely destroyed. November starting off strong.
I wasn‚Äôt ready the first time
I keep refreshing because I think the price is frozen. Nope, just literally stuck at 459.77
Imagine hating GME!
All the same trash that went up in unison with GME at the beginning of the year is attempting a comeback and it‚Äôs sad to see people still grasping for hope. Congrats on maybe breaking even for the year ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Not trusting these climbs and dips.
It went down immediately after I got in, every time.
Wednesday
Spy will go north of 470 by 11/19 so says I.
Lol that's wonderful
[deleted]
Hey I bought those
Because they could announce it tomorrow.
How is that even possible
buying more GME here before it pushes back up
BIA BIAAAAA
Sold gme call way too early missed out on extra $100 gains :/
For context this is 1.1% of the total market cap of SPY
Lol rekt
Last Thursday I did a $1200 for this Friday. $1500 actually seems like it could happen.
You go OCGN.  I made my money last week
They meet every week in the lobby of the Wendy‚Äôs as opposed to behind the dumpsters
Learn from it. But don't chase it. The market rewards patience.
hows dwac pack doing
[deleted]
Just fill out the paperwork.  Ok:  Learn to sell options, that's it.
I own 300 shares of Tesla and the biggest bull ever but even I know the rug pull gonna be epic. Stop loss at $1000 lol

Cuz the price keeps going up, spend more
Just check the GME yearly and you know why apes are still in. Higher and higher lows with spikes like right now
Fuck, I guess I'm back in GME. January vibes
I'll just go ahead and repeat what I said last night given it turns out I nailed it.

MVST, PSFE, BB, and RKT.

Edit: ATM calls and shares will pay $$$ imo.
How many bag holders have been picked up today?
A beautiful day.
Pretty sure it's shorts covering a little bit. They can't get below 170
In brambles
If you bought it last week
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Just chilling, being a wage slave n shit
Up nearly 50% on $TSLA, 70% on $XPEV and 40% on $F. I think there's a trend here, but not sure what it is....
Next quarterly runup date is Nov 23/34th
GameStop can‚Äôt stop, GameStop won‚Äôt stop
GME drop to $199, then liftoff

Trading strategy: buy TSLA call, head to the winchester, have a pint and wait for tendies. üç∫
ber not fuk, exterminated
We're not in a bubble, I swear!
When is OCGN decision day
Upvote for the honesty
Did $Z already announce bad earnings or something?
Fml
It's my birthday in a week. so you're welcome guys, wanted to do something nice for you guys for Bullvember
TSLA 1week and 1month charts are nutty ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I think you'll be alright. 169 is strong resistance.
Is it covered at least?? Lol
I guess it's gonna get all Q-anon in here again, isn't it
Yes
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
No you‚Äôre fucking not
I still have a ban bet on GME $300, it expires in 15 days so it better hit that price by then! Also their shareholders are all DRSing their shares which is true illiquid diamond handing!
It can , people bought calls at open to catch the hype/momentum.
hey i sold a nov 5 900 for about 800 dollars a few weeks ago üëçü§°üëç

Get the fffff out

Well looks like went to play in the wrong ball park this morning. I went to Spy field and played T-ball when I should‚Äôve went to Tesla field and played fast pitch hard ball.
I know imagine the even dumber plays i could do with all that extra capital
Dont forget, inflation is bullish.
good luck getting TSLA calls thru robinhood. better chance of shitting upside down without any skid marks left behind
OCGN dip buy now
For real, moon or the dirt. Nothing in between ü¶ç
INTC puts is kind of like cheating.
TSLA my number 1 meme stonk
Two weeks ago, only down like $600 on 15 contracts.
look O/I for calls to puts on wed and fri for SPY, we're well hedged and obligatory 500 EOY
Pfp checks out
#WHERE THAT TESLA BEAR THAT BOUGHT PUTS 2 WEEKS AGO AT?
Can't be the only reason the stock goes up 10% after trading sideways for 2 months
You can make plenty of money shorting Tesla on the wild swings it has, obviously it‚Äôs been killing it but a true bear knows when to buy and sell.  Plenty of easy 20 percent scalps on it though
Perhaps if the market wills it. We will be offered a second chance to atone for our teepee hands üôèüèº
Buy WE to show them who's boss
Thoughts on $SKLZ ER?
you smell bad
Good day to both have GME and TESLA in my portfolio
If the haters wanna see the GME saga finally finish then everyone dump their $1-500 they where going to lose this week anyway on it .
Sold my 1100 calls this morning for 120% gain i bought last week... I mean profits a profit but fuck me the bitch is flying to 1200 today... missed out on 15k already o.o
yes...precisely
That sounds good depending on when you bought it.
TSLA up $450B in market cap in one month. LMAOOOO
GME is starting up again
They gonna postpone taper

I‚Äôd be dope if I could buy Tesla calls too bad they won‚Äôt go through

And then trading it in for a Tesla
I might grab some otm long puts, but that's about it. Impossible to time it any closer.
I got 1/22 185c
Big tech wants to die but TSLA keeps pushing SPY higher in this gamma squeeze, nothing is real, Im in shambles.
THERE'S A WHOLE LOTTA MONEY IN THIS MOTHERFUCKER
You plan on welding
Amc sympathy off gme?
You need to work on your reading comp little guy, my point is 740,000 people didn't die of covid. It's a fraudvirus.

Hmm...SPY hitting ATH..being carried by TSLA +48% over last month...memestocks pumping....FOMC meeting with taper talks bound...*Sherlock, somethings afoot*
I need to be shamed for not taking profits. Downvote or insults only. Didn‚Äôt take Tim Apple profits.
Spy absolutely letting theta gang have is way with me
The fuck, my TSLA Jan 1725C are up 100%
Does the party ever stop?
Couldn't they potentially discuss tapering as soon as tomorrow?  Why stocks all green?
Only moderately?!
Last week when $ZIM was at $48 I said it would go to $60 by 11/17.   It‚Äôs half way there alredy.  On 11/17 they will report Hugh earnings. Just a heads up.  Check it out.

Just a little while longer. I ain't selling till we blow the fuck up
Spy‚Äôs gonna disappoint me both ways today isn‚Äôt it

Will the market be surprised if Fed tapers by $15b per month and starts in this month?
My 1250 banbet I set on Friday seems absurd now

Probably runs up during earnings at least, but other than that look how they massacred my boy

What you gonna buy?
I'd nut so hard in NNN,
[deleted]
CELH pumping. Looks like reason for jump is 
Coke's purchase of the outstanding shares of BodyArmour (85%) for $5.6 billion. Celsius is growing much faster and should be valued at a significant premium to BodyArmour. Therefore, if BodyArmour is worth ~$6.59 billion, one can reasonably estimate that Celsius may be worth ~$10 - $15 billion. At $10 billion, that would put Celsius at $135/share on the low end and $200/share on the high end.
I agree it ain‚Äôt worth it, but I do keep at it only for over the weekends.
Quick 3 bands from GME and I‚Äôm out

Some of y‚Äôall don‚Äôt get. Tesla is going to be the first massive cyperpunk dystopian corporation like the ones we see in sci fi. I get it. They‚Äôre overvalued. They have dumb ideas sometimes. They‚Äôre gonna get roasted. These arguments truly don‚Äôt matter

Got $17 11/12 RKT calls a little while ago for an earnings play, but went over 100% on them as of now so I did the smart thing for like once this year and sold 2/3 of them.
Selling a Tesla 1200 weekly call will be free money

Oh shit we really going to hit 1200 today

[deleted]
My 185c 1/22 are absolute dogshit.

RACE TO 1200 GME VS TSLA
Uhhhh Tsla going vertical
[deleted]
Speedrun to 4 digits again when it splits
Holy shit TSLA!!!!
This
TSLA.....my God!
someone fomo into tsla so it dips
why is TSLA up 7% today?  ü§î
Hold me yall I'm getting dizzy up here.
Holy shit 1200 by EOD was not a meme
I was doing that for a while, didn't work. Lost too much money with there never being any type of pullback. Literally nothing. Gonna wait and see, TSLA is literally solo carrying SPY/large caps on its back and it isn't slowing down.
Puts on MRNA. 

"The regulon analyses indicated that the states of the peripheral immune system after vaccination had reduced type I interferon responses, indicative of attenuated general antiviral abilities at least 28 days after the first inoculation."

"Together, these data suggested that after vaccination, at least by day 28, other than generation of neutralizing antibodies, people‚Äôs immune systems, including those of lymphocytes and monocytes, were perhaps in a more vulnerable state."

Ok now I‚Äôm scared
Oh I'm fucking prospering
NFLX strength translates to DIS weakness maybe, similar buyers I think. 

when NFLX reverses, DIS might as well
If history repeats itself, tsla will split soon, and then be included in the dow
Can I be a mod for a day so I can mass ban the monkeys
The Tesla calls I got rid of on the 22nd are worth a quarter million right now. I took an $800 profit ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
Look at that rsi
even i made money, and i barely understand what I am doing. even my option are green.
TSLA volume finally picking up?
üöÄüöÄüöÄGME GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrüöÄüöÄüöÄ
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Psymonthe2nd (0/1) made a bet that PUBM would go to 33.0 when it was 29.4 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
GME ripping on 2.4mil volume kekw
So TSLA gonna bypass AMZN pretty soon at this rate, and for no apparent reason too
pay up
GME!  Let‚Äôs go!  Where u all at???
I did 1300 for 11/5 and already up 20% üòé
So when is TSLA gonna split?
Lets go KenGriffin!
Congratulations, you lived.
GME making me rock hard today
I feel ya. It feels too good to be true
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/buythetulipdips (0/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 405.0 when it was 434.0701 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Why
Ur so greedy for even asking Jesus
[deleted]
Like seriously how much can TSLA keep going ?  Wtf
Finally taking roots at my new agency I started at a month ago, but now I‚Äôm going to be having the last interview for a job that is offering me $20,000 more. A crisis is coming
/u/zachjsrf
I agree valuations don't make any sense, but shorting TSLA on a run is like stepping in front of a train
Up to you. Just remember the golden rule: bulls make money, bears can make money, but pigs get slaughtered
Gains are gains. Keep going
I honestly saw this and burst out laughing maniacally, now everyone thinks I‚Äôm insane.
Like I said earlier, I think we‚Äôre going to need that GME mega thread
Anyone looking to fomo here on tesla with me ?
Bro I bought a 1150 call on 7/16 with an expiry at 1/21
For real, not an ape but this shit about to explode again.
I thought you guys said GME will never hit $200 again

# ü§°
Welcome back to 200 GME.
Shorting $OCGN at the $8 mark. They‚Äôre $.08 right now. Loading up.
I don‚Äôt think I can use Meta is daily conversation in reference to Facebook. All I can think of is metagross.

That is all.
Maybe sell a portion now?
Getting ready to double down on my 3400 monthly

my hunch was right. Gamestore breaking out bigly hopefully this isn‚Äôt bull trap.
TSLA is the only thing keeping SPY up.
TSLA PRINTER KEEPS GOING
Nobody is betting against this market. Zero headwinds anywhere.
Gamestop tweeted the second that $GME hit $200 lol
Why is $DIS so utter shit? I mean seriously..
Take the profits then roll half back in to later expiry
Gamestonk
nope, dividends but thats it
I really REALLY want to go short.... 1200 im doing it..
Could we see another Tesla split? It just keeps going up and I can‚Äôt remember exactly what it was at before the last split, but $2k per share seems very likely at this point.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
I buy puts every Friday, but will be switching it to Thursday‚Äôs.
1500 by 11/5?
Jesus Christ, SPY is just licking 460's taint.
I bought TSLA puts today ü§°
GME gonna break the fuck out. Lfg
You turned 1k into 13k and are asking when to sell.

This is why everyone loses money on WSB.
Damn this is next level retardation
I think they want to target corporations to conduct business.
That‚Äôs a great return. Taking profits is ok. Live to fight another day
TSLA is like the money printer from gmoD RP
Alright who‚Äôs the one person in here who lost money today? Out yourself, And explain how you achieved the impossible
Spy is being solo carried by tsla.
Ludicrous speed!
PYPL killing me...
If you play for this kind of move, you will lose in the long run.
i need some kenny g memes

How did you get a TSLA call for only 1k?
anyone buying NET PUTS?
SOFI Gang

it's our turn
GME wildin
GME breaking 200 rn and never coming back down
So checking several big-cap stocks, and from what I can tell, Tesla is literally holding up the entire stock market right now.

Seems healthy and not at all precarious.
FUCKING SHOULDA BOUGHT IWM CALLS
Ahh just trying to justify the poor choice of buying puts. Sorry friend. Don't fight the trend.
Holy crap Zillow completely screwed the pooch:

'"‚ÄúZillow may have leaned into home acquisition at the wrong time, and we believe earnings may be at risk due to its current home inventory ($1.17 billion at 2Q21),‚Äù Yruma wrote in a note to clients.

Yruma said it completed an analysis of 650 homes in Zillow‚Äôs inventory, or about one-fifth of the homes owned, and found that 66% are currently listed below the purchase price at an average discount of 4.5%."'

How do you screw up home buying when home prices only go up right now lol.
Lol JFC tsla. Let it rip.
Toilet paper will be the new gold
Gains are gains man. Can't be mad at profit.
Leveraged cfds
first real dip

Never too late to FOMO
It's kinda weird bc fed would only taper if the economy is in a healthy place, which would imply rising prices. But, if the fed quits buying then thats a lot of money not flowing into the market. Rising interest rates would disproportionally affect smaller companies, but small/mid caps have been devastated since Feb. It's possible that some of that has already been baked in.

Demand $9000 worth of narcotic pharma and get a 200mg ibuprofen

Xom hit all time highs today
MRNA calls were dirt cheap this morning. I have some 11/12 $325c already green
Additionally, because of the insane demand for teslas, we can have a global disater, and tesla will still be able to operate at 100% capacity, and not skip a beat. If half the people that ordered a tesla cancelled their order, tesla would still be able to run their assembly lines at full speed because the demand outpaces their supply by that much. Will become a problem if they can't keep up in the long term, but compared to the likes of ford and gm, it helps their margins significantly

Don't want to short tesla, just want to sell as I have a bad feeling about this Hertz order, it's not what should drive decent continuous progress. I'll be more enthusiastic about a new cheaper model, or breakthrough in technology or production. 

So I'm just wondering if I should get out and get in later with a better price for the coming years.

Rotation to small caps
The bull case has nothing to do with right now and everything to do with the future. If (and a massive if at that) Tesla is able to be successful at everything it's trying to do, there's no precedence for it and no justifiable price target. Car company that makes its own network of charging stations, makes solar panels for people to charge at home, cheaper insurance for the cars it produces, self driving network for said cars, and happens to be the only  car brand allowed in a growing network of boring tunnels. Right now it's easy to dismiss such an outlandish valuation but it has potential to be one of the wildest consumer monopolies in existence.

ya being kinda meme like rn.
Did you buy call options on ER?
Watch spy get like 2-3 mil huge buy orders now lmao
TSLA not slowing down till it reaches the 1300 target
Bull case every retard diamond hands and every time shorts try to short it you buy massive amount of calls to gamma squeeze them. It's not about fundamentals , it's about the limited supply like bitch coin except there is only 16M for bitch coin (because tons of them are lost) while there are 1B shares of TSLA.
Definitely will be between $16-$20 range.
!banbet SRNE 40 8w

More shares, so i guess i should be good

Total bullshit way to think about it. Their games remain insanely popular. World of Warcraft has been milking money every year since it‚Äôs creation in 2004. They don‚Äôt have to bring new IPs to the table necessarily. Just continue to grow player base across existing games, adding new IPs sparingly.

Look at the company‚Äôs bottom line and stop being such a gamer.

Can someone explain the TSLA bull case.. It so over priced imo
CHGG might be the truth, god help me let an impulse earnings purchase work out 1 time
Dude I was all in tesla on margin and I sold it all at 550. I‚Äôm nowhere near where I‚Äôd be now :( don‚Äôt worry fam someone is always worse off than us
NVDA do what TSLA is doing
I bought 20
More shares today to average up
I bought a bitcoing in 2016 for 550 ish and sold it the same month at a loss of pennies. I'm the real clown
Up .64% today. Very happy with that too
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
the TSLA pump is sucking the energy out of other megacaps
this is like the 7th time this year you buy BA under $212 and you are guaranteed to make money.
You guys know intc was trading for 80 per share in 1999. That‚Äôs like tsla today. You will literally never recoup your investment if you buy at 1200

Yeah, I may try to play it closer to end of Dec when it should be cheaper to play with less time value on the options.
I feel your pain
I just wanna put it out there the real clown is me. I sold TSLA earlier this year at 562

Today I woulda been rich. And I even took a loss at that trade during that time. Fuck me

Edit: $562
THANK YOU FOR YOURE SACRIFICE! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
This is the TSLA market
Let me know what you think.. Here is one of my bullet points:

The unreliability of intraday patterns seem to come mostly from going against strong momentum. Momentum tends to break through patterns until the volume dies slows down. For example, with strong bullish momentum, bearish patterns such as a rising Wedge will likely be broken unless volume is dropping significantly while the price was continuing to push higher. The volume should be observed on 15 or 30 minute charts to compare with previous days.
Leave that bullshit out of here.
How many?
to where, lmao

Isn‚Äôt that what a incel is
Kinda hard not too‚Ä¶. Once you sell its so hard to buy back.
If you keep buying TSLA puts you should just get out of trading and stop taking it so personal
Mark it!!

!RemindMe 4d
When Apple starts ripping oh, she's going to get crazy
LCID has teslas ex head engineer and Saudi oil Barron's unlimited fund backing. 

Imagine thinking they aren't capable of fast tracking production when they've hit every target and are bringing good factory jobs back to America.

They are heading to 60 within a week
It's better to secure 50% of profits 80% of the time than secure 100% of profits  20% of the time... confirm the trend first.
I think this is a bandwagon ride and everyone is hopping on and the rich fuckers are about to sell and leave everyone holding the bag, this literally cant go on forever like this

Tesla up another 1.5% and my puts are up 3% from what I bought them for. Timing is key folks
Who the fuck is buying all this TSLA...

Like seriously..

I love it but its just ridiculous now lol
460 hard rejection
I think ATVI will be a very strong earnings play.

Plenty of cash cow games under their belt, and their stock price has taken a hit recently because of the company‚Äôs ‚Äúculture.‚Äù Something that can be easily fixed by replacing personnel. Nothing to do with their bottom line, which remains extremely impressive.







It‚Äôs a very profitable company at a significant discount in my opinion.
Who knew that a virus that would end up killing 740k+ Americans in under 2 years would be the best thing to ever happen to the stock market. Classic. Can‚Äôt wait for the documentaries years from now.
near GOOG intraday low, limit buy at 2896, but I'll probably up it a little bit. 2900 feels strong.
No way Tesla goes to 1500 by nov 5 i will eat a shoe if it does
What I like to see, solid volume and a steady rise in TSLA price throughout the day, I wanna see this bb pop 1250 this week... that being said I have trailing stops set and so should you
IWM at the top of the range
Is Elon is wrong, I don‚Äôt want to be right.
The size of the sell walls getting knocked down on SPY are ridiculous.
PLUG ATH is $75. there's still a lot of room for ppl to make money
You still going to have day trading limits and restrictions on other options.
TNA ripping!!!
Everything is green‚Ä¶ including TLRY. This could be a bad omen.
tsla puts losing hardly any value...
I went all in on DWAC at $168, i will be up on that trade soon‚Ä¶
I think it's gonna go down but buying puts on earnings is way more risky than usual.

Buy High, and Buy Low! Just Buy, Buy, Buy!!!
Did RKT announce they're releasing Full Self Driving^TM ?
just thinking about the TSLA 1150c I had that expired last friday
My broker won‚Äôt approve me for level 2‚Ä¶they must think I‚Äôm a risk to myself.
Call me crazy, but got 2 calls for Tesla. 2,025c 1/21/22 and 2/18/22 2,100c. Fingers crossed ü§û
You can dream for memes to explode and retire, or you can buy spy 8 times and do do the same thing. For a grand total of 3 weeks

the general problem is that autopilot can do highway driving pretty well where it's just following simple rules like staying inside lanes and what not. but when it comes to urban environments and local streets much of that is done by intuition. a fully self driving car (no one at the wheel etc) is not possible without solving AGI so the car can think for it's self. it's not happening any time soon imo. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\_general\_intelligence

TSLA VERY UNDERVALUE
I refuse to believe TSLA can just keep going up indefinitely. There has to be a major pullback here at some point. Because otherwise we‚Äôre all just accepting that the market is fake and‚Ä¶ and nothing matters‚Ä¶ and

Oh fuck.
TSLA making no sense to me. Not upset, but it makes no sense to see it pump 3% per day for the past week. Getting scurred
They have Teslas ex head engineer.. better range than Tesla and opening new factories in AZ by me. 

I'm bullish on both
lol @ F trying to have a 4% day. This really is the strangest timeline.

agree, probably upward
Let me ask you one question, was tesla worth 800 in the first place? 

Exactly, it don't make sense just fomo in

but over the air software updates can change things quickly, within an existing fleet. that's the wild card imo.
What do you program in useually?
whats the dd on that? i forgot. setup dont look bad
Its safe, I already did my gambling earlier and now i need to be more conservative. Plug fucked me, i thought it topped out after that good news but it went up like 8 percent after 34 hah
#DAMN IM MAKIN MONEY WHILE I SLEEP
And I totally refuse to believe that. And instead of getting taxed 50%, it will be 8% or something, so even if I sold at the top, holding for a year is better.
AAPL
FCEL to $20 PLUG to $70
No shot it reaches 1500 by the fifth. The 12th is likely assuming it doesn't correct before then

My GME calls are gonna make me a millionaire in about 3 weeks
If you need to ask when you should sell, you should probably sell now
I'm gonna assume you don't know shit about gme volume if you think this is slow
or below 1000
When you retire. Which, coincidentally, is when you sell your shares
Holy crap TSLA
If you don't have TSLA calls you ain't black.
nope i bought 40cs like a true autist
That‚Äôs the thing, you don‚Äôt
hey guys so should i buy a share of TSLA or do you want it to keep going
If my ICLN leaps from last year actually hit, that would be soo dank
Yeah, that's been what I've been applying to now exclusively for a few weeks.
Visa you are officially dead to me. Worst stock in the history of finance
I'd wait another hour, AAPL is gaining
But you could have sold in January at 400, which it will never ever get close to again
Nope. I‚Äôm holding 1x1100C, 3x1200C (11/05) and don‚Äôt plan to sell them till Thursday or Friday.
At this rate Tesla could be 1300 in premarket tomorrow
Oh, because it isn‚Äôt a get-rich-quick scheme, it‚Äôs a trash stock? I mean, it was a get-rich-quick scheme about a year ago. Now it‚Äôs just a solid company and has consolidated and will continue to grow from here.
I drive one, I can confidently say the current model 3/y/x/s will never be authorized for SAE level 5. In fact Tesla's lawyers agree with me: [https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35785277/tesla-fsd-california-self-driving/](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35785277/tesla-fsd-california-self-driving/).

It's only Elon that is deluded on this as he has been since 2016 when he promised coast to coast FSD trip with no interventions.

when do i sell my TSLA shares? I always time this shit wrong
at the end of the day, the only regret I'll have about meta is not buying more
Plz do it and post results.

re... search?
I‚Äôm down 3k so far don‚Äôt do it
Put debit spreads on TSLA now or what lmfao
- Elon announce another stock split
- It goes up another 20%
Since when is this sub about rangebound stocks
OCGN can‚Äôt get past that 14.25 mark for very long
If you short my portfolio from 11am to close you'd be a multi millionaire. It's almost guaranteed cash flow
did he studder?
it's even more ridiculous (actually bearish to me), because hertz is now effectively acting as Uber's outsourced fleet management service, which should, in high population areas (aka where the wealth is) further transfer the individual car buys into mobility services. 

I trust elon on this, but I don't see how giving a taxi service 150k of your soon to be self driving vehicles is a boon to future car sales.

Just buy TSLA. This is and always will be THE ev play.
Do it anyways, need something entertaining
They got these fancy electric cars at the airports now where that Tom Brady fella recharges.
Yeah i could see it, still grabbed the put for a hedge if it tanks tonight

Diogenes did. Man had no care in the world so much so he jerked his pecker in public.
You missed the fact that Elon solved world hunger and TSLA shares are now the reserve currency for earth AND Mars

TSLA has returned more in the past month than LCID has... There is really no good reason to buy LCID. TSLA is the next TSLA.
I thought OCGN would only get money from USA and Canada doses?

Haha makes sense my friend. Me neither.
Well okay man.
i bought a call.. doubtful it'll print
It's broken out of the wedge upside. Technically it should keep climbing.
Probably SOFI, but SENS is my high conviction play.
OCGN is just before 15,60 where it got beaten down twice
Still a good buy ?
what so you got puts? what strike / expiry?
I sold plug at $2 last year. AMA.
Not extreme anymore
it is unbelievable. the bubble of my lifetime.

(so far)
Hoping SQ at least rises to $260‚Äôs pre earnings, I suspect they will post promising results.
Going down
Same here. Can you venmo me some money to help the stonk?
So close to moly.  Come on baby my mouth is watering.
The real question is: Who wasn't buying Tesla at $500/share a few months ago?
I feel like there must be another group of retards speaking another language that's buying all this shit at the top. It can't just be us.
#LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT

Hertz, the **bankrupt rental car company**, claims that they are going to spend 4 billion on Tesla cars.   In the middle of a global pandemic, when Tesla can't even obtain the computer chips they need to make their cars.

The Tesla stock price shoots from 800 to 1200 in no time flat, adding like 400 billion dollars in market capitalization.

Did I miss something?
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/chewks** bet **SQ** goes from **254.47** to **270.0** before **2021-11-06 12:27:54.012920-04:00**
So who is gonna play AMC earnings tomorrow?
I would like to take a second to thank CCL for halting it's 27th nose dive in 4 months so that my portfolio can breath. (CCL is 23% of my portfolio)
!banbet SQ 270 5d
It's obviously over valued, but I have not the testicular fortitude to have a bearish stance.
been telling y‚Äôall since $9 to buy ocgn
I know someone short 300 shares since $900. We talk about markets a lot. I haven't talked to him in a while because I know he's not gonna be in the mood to talk. Dx
If you enjoy money buy gpi calls it's really that simple
Every GME jump is smaller than the last one.
&gt; I'm not interested in how much you made, I want to know why the fuck did you invest?
A year ago maybe
Fukkin WBX decided to stop trading?
Yes

Because I'm lazy and they have no incentive to actually pay it out. Plus there's pages and pages of DD and it's a lot harder to disprove speculation then it is to create it.. For what it's worth I have a few shares of gme, 1 as a just in case and 2 cause I've seen how strong cult following is.  
Maybe you guys are right, but if you can't give a date by which this will happen I just doubt it will happen cause it seems to me like it can be pushed back indefinitely
She's gonna follow Tesla and run to 50 this week
Imagine thinking selling 10 cars is the same as billions in revenue.
If anyone needs help finding resistance levels, just check the price I bought at. It always acts as resistance after I buy.
$1500 11/5 might actually pay

Am I stupid enough to put the rest of my cash savings into TSLA calls?
Which smoothbrains didn't know about the stocks? Most of the dumbass here bought it during IPO at $350.
TQQQ leaps seem like a no brainer. Thoughts?
ah, i see
Ford to $19 EOW
Them boys are the true diamond hands LOL
AAPL is that junkie friend you have that also wants you to be a junkie

Bought AAPL Leaps a year ago. They are up 10-30%.

Just bought Some TSLA and FB calls today‚Ä¶Already up 30%
Who exactly is buying all this TSLA at $1200 a share?
Imagine watching Tesla rn and thinking LCID isn't about to leg up to 50 tmrw
I spend it trading and managing my rentals and other finances. 

Same thing though. I'm just here for healthcare.
i literally cant stand my life anymore. my time is up
People knew they just fomoed at ipo for 300 plus and have been quiet bagholding for a long time
Yes. That‚Äôs why I yolo‚Äôd almost all I got into Facebook option calls right before the crash :) I‚Äôm a dumb ass

But I moved some things around and now I‚Äôm all in on Facebook calls. I might be a real dumb ass.
and we thought that was only gonna happen nov 3rd
DIS slow climb, just bet the farm on a jump tomorrow if CDC approves the vaccine for kids
why do you think people bought GME in the first place?
Fuck it bought some 1200 calls. Was wanting to do it at open but work fucked me. Can‚Äôt wait to get fucked again
Given IV the upside isn‚Äôt that great.  When the pump ends it is going to be devastating.  People pretend like February never happened
That 3 month chart looks pretty nice tho
Told myself ill never buy daily spy puts again and yet here i am.
JBLU has popped down to $14 then headed right back over $16 five times this year.

TSLA to $1240 EOD
I mean, any might hit, but right now the premiums are crazy
Never short TSLA
no gas its electric
Yes. Also, doesn‚Äôt lose money.
Probably because the FED isn't selling the asset purchases, just slowing their buying.
Anyone else spending their time at work applying to new, higher paying jobs?
for us? we owe u one

Shit man, had COIN ü™ô when none of you smoothbrains even knew about its potential (at $225) but unfortunately lost the shares and missed out on $61000 worth of gains üòíüòíüòíüòí
The SEC confirmed in their report that GME was shorted 127% at least and that the Jan run was retail FOMO...means shorts still aren¬¥t closed. Even without that GME is a good long term play now
People have been talking about that stock since it ipo‚Äôd kiddo
Is it true that scared money dont make no money?
GME holyyyyy
Cause interest rates are going up now that fed is going to announce tapering.  Banks have been doing well across us and can too

I might have to as well, this might be another RKT situation ‚Ä¶

I definitely think OCGN will pump hard, but I can‚Äôt find a reason for the pump to last
It's gonna stock split one more time first
Retards saying they'll announce taper tomorrow. Is it true? Should I buy more FD calls?
does TSLA have gas for 1300 this week? is this all just riding from ther Hertz thing still or did something else happen?
This is exactly how I feel‚Ä¶
LET'S FUCKING GO PLUG
if it goes up to 250 soon, i might get my wife to come back and dump her boyfriend
Just getting back into $400k range with my gambling account. Haven‚Äôt been there since the first GME squeeze.  Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd make it back here til eoy
Yeah. The weeklies slap you down real quickly. Got me -50%
What the fuck is Tesla doing?
dude i forgot what you meant for a minute...feels like the  dwacc attacc was a lifetime ago 

The market is like dog years, I swear
But i will sell TSLA at $1200 and buy more GME if it's below $220. As you can see i have no idea what i'm doing.
who knows but do you want to be one of those shorts who got blown up the last couple of weeks?

The 1 month spy chart is fucking nuts and this is all before infa bill
I wish I hadn‚Äôt sold covered calls on COIN a month and a half ago and lost the shares at $240. I had them at an avg of 225, when no one even talked about the stock on wsb. üòîüòîüòî

ZIM GME TSLA why the fuck do I even go to my job
How do these two statements make sense?  1. All these cnbc people have said for 1.5 years is that due to QE of $120b per month the market will keep going up. And now, they all say tapering down of QE won‚Äôt make a difference. My dumb mind can‚Äôt see how both can be true.
OCGN gonna break $15
WTF is a Walmart? Do they sell Teslas?
Welcome to the meta verse
no - that platform is actually such a shit show. As much as I hate robinhood (I trade on merrill / webull), it's still miles ahead of Sofi

Can't imagine I would use it for trading, but I'm tempted to switch for banking

‚ÄúThe Matterport Takeaways: Ives highlights a partnership announced between Matterport and Facebook earlier this year as a key event that could get more attention from investors. The partnership was for creating the largest-ever dataset of 3D indoor spaces via Facebook AI Research.

'We believe this was the first step towards a much broader Facebook and Matterport relationship as Zuckerberg &amp; Co. head down the metaverse path,' Ives said.

Matterport has a 'vast 3D-data library,' which Ives calls unmatched in the industry. The company is mentioned as a play in the growing market and important for real estate and other sectors.

'We continue to believe Matterport is in the early innings of a massive growth story playing out over the coming years.'

Ives calls the stock under the radar based on investor conversations and said he likes the stock heading into 2022, with metaverse plays grabbing investors' attention.

Growth could come from the company as its free to paid conversion model is further realized.

A total addressable market size of $240 billion is cited by the analyst and a market share of under 1% for Matterport gives the company room to expand, according to Wedbush.‚Äù
You tell that bot!
Been slowly taking profits over the past few weeks. Letting the rest rip to 25
It was 1200 in February, so shares are even cheaper now by that metric,
AFRM seems to go up to 164  then straight down to 152-153 then back up to 164.  Rinse and repeat.   This is the down day.

I should never hedge and just go long all the time now until December
I cannot believe tsla is moving this much
The one stock no one is selling apparently lol

With 450% IV
earnings before open tomorrow, I believe. hard to say what will happen, but the run up from 84ish will cause me to avoid it.
Why would the shorts be covering now when they just had a -20% day a few days ago? Wouldn't they have exited then?

I think cloud companies are just inherently expensive. Probably multiply by some X factor whatever the fundamental analysis says. Been watching them for a while and valuations are just insane: SNOW @ 357, TWLO @ 300, CRWD @ 264, etc.

DWAC good buy now
Better than that, he said he'd even buy more at 1250
He's in coma
Will QCOM ever move?
Bagholder spotted
People thinking its RKLB, I wish I was joking
he said he was gonna scale into the position as it rose. anyways, i‚Äôm shorting tsla at around 1211
Software sales can be a very lucrative path and if you understand what it is you‚Äôre selling that‚Äôs really nice brownie points
bruh that was its PE this morning, its at 380 now, get with the times
Yeah the XLNX options will convert into AMD options at that ratio.

So like if AMD is $125, XLNX conversion value would be $215. 

Safest way will likely be to just buy some slightly OTM XLNX options.

XLNX would go to $205-210 immediately after China grants clearance.

Obviously that's biggest risk which is a wild card.
Have they announced when they are reporting earnings?
[deleted]
Forward PE is only 135
If you don't fomo in OCGN you don't belong here
TSLA PE too low imo

Fuck. Was watching novavax ceo or whatever on bloomberg. They just got approval and it i watched it pump but i didnt Buy enough. Goddammit
HOLY SHIT OCGN LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
You will find something.
Anyone playing SPR earnings call on Wednesday? I‚Äôm trying to decide whether to double down on them or not. Big factor of their success is Boeing doing well.
RKT looking spicy
If you buy longer dated contracts it‚Äôll help most likely. Unless you going for FD‚Äôs on purpose that is. 

I had the issue trying to bet on direction and magnitude, but with longer dated options you don‚Äôt have to hit the strike to still make money.
I hope too. Sold 400 shares a while ago, but holding 600
If SPY would just hurry up and go to 2,000 I could retire.
If you don't own any TSLA shares what are you even doing.
Should I buy spy calls this week?
OCGN
Lucid going green! They shook all the paperhands out, gearing up for the run to 60 by Friday

I kind of want to but if we rally to like $1190 or something they‚Äôll get totally blown out

TSLA + Meta + Oil

I‚Äôll buy back in if it hits the floor again. Why not.
Best day *so far.*
In this mkt buy every dip
what's driving OCGN growth?
Gap fill to $300 load up
Just once I want to look away for like 15 minutes and come back to a face melting rally that put my calls deep itm, but no, I can't look away for 15 minutes.
If they weren‚Äôt weeklies I wouldn‚Äôt be as concerned. Probably will just take the loss, I can make it elsewhere at the right time‚Ä¶
Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt fuck with bank stocks huh 
Would like to put a lot of cash into puts for Jan &amp; Feb
Seems obvious With taper
They are really going to announce tapering at the Fed Meeting a Day before SQ earnings report...My itm 230C for 11/12 calls getting fucked?
Tesla needs to split, they will easily become first 1 quadrillion dollar company at this rate.
Mttr connected to FB?  


I thought they just had a business arrangement for some things?
Really happy I went balls deep in grwg calls Friday
AMD makes no sense lmao
Alright, mSfT wAs HoLdiNg SPY Friday..  
What tf is keeping it afloat today?!
Time for a new ATH @OCGN
Maybe set the bar lower, try applying to meta
tbf most of them are sourced from the indexes, so i justify it by saying that i'm just dodging the fees, that and the small numbers involved individually, it is unmanageable though, and i'm heavily exposed to market risk, so when the big dip comes, i'll struggle to respond effectively.

Let the GME FOMO unfold once again
ü•≠: Quite possibly the greatest SPAC ever sold, anywhere, ever
beware, it's extremely expensive fundamentally. I know how silly that sounds, but the profitability picture didn't improve q/q and the market expected more. I think this is short covering.

I think it hits 265 or lower before year end.
It will dump 5% in 60 seconds you just never know when those 60 seconds are
i made it back to green portfolio, now i just need to double my money to get back to my ATH üôÇ
Not any dumber than the people buying it up here.  Euphoria is usually when it dumps.

SPY w the autist strength and run to $500+ EOY
Hw wondering why do you think it‚Äôs going to keep going up? I have a dec 17th 22.5 call which is up about 80% for the position and I‚Äôm debating closing it out and taking profit or waiting for the earning run up in IV and selling before they release.

Good thing I didn‚Äôt buy those 1100 TSLA C on Friday for $40‚Ä¶damnittttttt
Why does spy look retarded
It's a house of cards, IMO.  Once some bearish news hits the market, like tapering or the collapse of infra negotiations, the market will stumble and TSLA will collapse.  So if you have a huge pile of cash already, buy some puts dated for december.
Who's Lisa?

TDA is such a bad broker. You pay 20 bucks just to get to trade on a forbidden ticker via broker, but if you want to adjust the fucking bid on a broker created trade, you have to call the fucking broker back and have them manually adjust it. What kind of shit is that?
Feels that way ü§ûüèª
I think that‚Äôs what the September note sale was. They pledged to spend $750m if the approval was successful. Technically they have 3 months after an approval to announce it to give them time to get people in key positions.
All musk needs to do to end world hunger is give every kid a quarter of a tesla share

Lackluster product, missed earnings, pulled guidance, and being used as a simple store of wealth to the point of gross overvaluing. Should be doing a lot better in this market, I agree. Buy Puts, it should go up.
Paper trade every day for three months to learn how to trade.
Maybe you could average down a little more and re-gain some losses back. gl
Nah, TSLA is a group of multiple different disruptive technologies, that's vertically integrated, incredibly efficient, very well led, and with with no real competition.

You're high
&gt; I don‚Äôt think you understand.
So basically, Tesla is a meme stock.  Regular TA doesn‚Äôt apply.
You do realize you can‚Äôt solve world hunger just by giving someone $6 billion?

The same agency that made the comment has an annual budget of like $8b.

$6 billion is like .5% of the us federal budget. (The us spends way more than .5% of its budget on programs for the poor etc).

Anyways - that was the whole point of Elon‚Äôs response
Like?
Zoom out ü§°, it‚Äôs spent plenty of time above $11
Want to buy coin calls for this week :D but buying on 8% up mondays is a bad idea D:
It‚Äôs a perpetual money machine, what‚Äôs wrong with you?
Just insane call option buying. Everyone makes money
CRWD you fucking slut i'll fooking buy your dip
Thank you TSLA ü§ò
Anyone know what it was last year that put a halt the gama explosion? At some point it just... Stopped. until they announced the stock split anyway

So time to ape on Mind Med?
XLNX options will double (at least) if the AMD merger goes through (because it's an all stock merger).

Dunno how risky the China approval situation is though.

AMD execs were confident China would give approval in Dec.

I may load some January XLNX calls at end of Nov if they are trading at a 70% discount to AMD options at the 1.7234 merger ratio.

Massive amounts of call options being placed and shorts constantly getting blown up plus crazy cult fomo.
It‚Äôs def a gamma squeeze. Worst thing anyone can do is risk money they absolutely cannot afford to lose. So naturally I bet my mortgage payment on it last week.
Tomato/tomatoe. Making money, even if just a little, and hedging for the dump with the puts. Won‚Äôt get anyone on the front page of WSB, but it‚Äôs honest work
Been saying this for years. Now I‚Äôm making bank on calls

If all it took was $6b, world hunger would‚Äôve been solved long ago.
Sheeeeiiiit.. when will Amazon accept Teslas as payment?
It's all apes at this point. 

I don't think it's Hitting 200 again
Then light on üî•
Look over here not over there
TSLA will keep going up as long as people think it can capitalize on FSD. Looking at its market cap currently is irrelevant
It‚Äôs ok to be a dude and like dudes
Lol no have lots of November puts.   This current price is just the pump phase.  We are on to the dump phase now.
B.T TX won't stop baby fuck wsb and banning $PACs. ppl missing out on free money
Is LCID the hillbilly mongoloid cousin to TSLA?
I was on your boat a few weeks ago. If I were you instead of trying to make big risky plays while having a decent amount of money (60K) I'd focus on paying off debt, and investing like 40K in an ETF. Keep like 10K for trading.

If anything goes wrong on these risky plays you will hate yourself.

Spy very stylish move ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)
They haven't reverted to the regular color scheme.  You're still on the Halloween patch. They'll change the scheme back maybe end of this week.
To answer your question, yes I believe it has everything to do with their name. False bump
I‚Äôm so retarded for paper handing tsla on that minor dip at 1160 /: I gotta stop doing that
Great way to pull some profits without entirely spooking investors.. he will just sell 50b and give 6b out for deduction purposes
What earnings are you guys playing for tomorrow? Anyone looking at RIG, FANG or CHGG?
'our weeklies'? You including the SEC ahead of time?

AAPL got be the most underwhelming stock in 2021
If someone put a gun to your head and said go all in on TSLA puts, what's the best bet? I'm thinking it's gambling that the gun misfires.
Haha TSLA goes brrrrrrrrrrr
1,420.69
Wow go Tesla looks like elons paying us all this Christmas boys and girls
so aapl wtf are you doing? can you please go up now?
I think TSLA stock has a structural issue with shorts and it keeps knocking them over... or something... because this is not normal.  I mean, I think its great, but there is more than just "sentiment" at play here.
[deleted]
Yeah but compared to what you could've made on other calls its sad
gme coming back for a 4th round or what
You must be a PROG bull. I see it going to $2 easy.
TSLA going to add QQQ to its index
Any news on the SOFI bank charter? I feel like it should be imminent.

But what about if we‚Äôre holding it, selling covered calls, and also buying puts?
Amd and sofi starting their runs
Look at the 1 year on XRT starting at January 26th. 

It ripped face and has been suppressed all year. 

Just looking at that chart vs SPY shows you that shorts never covered and have hammered xrt to keep GME from exploding.

I have 60k and I want to get 10-15k asap. Any ideas?

the DD you come here for. TSLA headquarters on Mars 2025 not priced in
Good tip. Thanks.
I want to unload my game shares but last time I did that the price doubled 10 min later. THEY are trying to get me
this might sound ridiculous but draw a trendline on the all time chart for tsla starting with the 2/20/19 bump. If projected, it's a 1500 price target.
LMFAO...RIP to the bagholders holding the piece of shit PROG
Tsla is just stupid , but I‚Äôm more stupid as I just sit here and watch it moon and say ‚Äúit can‚Äôt possibly go any higher‚Äù.  But it does, it‚Äôs insane and makes no sense but onwards she goes‚Ä¶
I like TSLA a lot I think it‚Äôs undervalued!
How I have not been assigned my $970 CC by now is beyond me
I heard she can smell success from over a mile away
Damn, I shouldn't have cucked out and turned my SoFi calls into spreads last week
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
I‚Äôm calling TSLA top here

Now it will rally 20%
One stock is up +155%. Halted again
&gt; Yes. I have a few questions on my options application that are not clear to me.
goddamn it, i've been waiting for tesla to dip for a week hoping to average down but fucker never dips
Too risky even for 401k
We will succeed in our trade!
Imagine losing money when the spy is up 43% over the past year lmao.
My ROTH can. I can even do covered calls. Don‚Äôt think I can do spreads though. It only goes to level 2 as a max I think. 

Did you fill out an options application?
after earnings we gonna be down 40% YTD dw
Yields surging, VIX rising, and TSLA mooning lol
SPY is red and I'm way green without being a bear. This is just my superior intellect that I'm sure won't become ashes in my mouth this week.
Wish I bet on SOFI this week.
What‚Äôs this NOV. 8-11th sheet?
Oh wait, nevermind. Wrong stock, lol. I was thinking MTTP
XOS gonna have its time. 200%+ upside from analysts
Down 45% on Jan calls. I should stop adding more now.
It‚Äôs been a gamma ramp for a week now ü§≠
SoFi just decided to go bananas today
Go with a "dividend aristocrat" type of stock.  Get your money quarterly whilst still being invested for the long term.
you don't have to wear shoes if you are not walking. short nike
sometimes-a good, sometimes-a maybe shit.
Stop trying to make rat happen, Heather.  It's not going to happen.
Elon, split when? :(
Is OCGN a good company or WSB ape pumped meme?  It has been making me money on the regular and I wondering if I should cut and run or double down.
A lot of folks asking about taking profits from Sophie. Get out when you feel comfortable, a profit is a profit, don't feel bad about making money.

But anything under $30 is a steal
Whatever it is i am not playing it right.
If I ever get rich off these stocks I‚Äôm 1000% going to try to marry the big nose whore from west world. She changed my life

why da fuk is DM going up today.   finally switched to selling calls and getting my ass handed to me slowly.

All Greg Egg had to do to buy that new $40k watch was grab calls on Meta and Tesla last Friday 

Buying Tesla $1300 myself now
MTTR and SOFI. My bet anyway.
Is this a tsla gamma ramp? Many calls are itm
It pumped Friday when they released a free app, then over the weekend it got speculation about being tied to Meta. Two separate bumps since Friday morning.
FOMOd got out with a quick 100 thanks papa but still made i missed out on 2k
Yes over the long haul AMC will go bankrupt.

But I'm talking about the stock, not the company.  The stock is completely detached from the company for now (which will go bankrupt eventually). 

The stock has a market cap of $18bn and gets counted as a small cap (as nonsensical as that is).

So if billions of $ chase IWM/Russell 2000, some will end up pumping up AMC.
Does this one require you to wind it up before setting it loose

The fact that AAPL is worth more than TSLA is a JOKE!!!! TSLA should be worth more than AAPL + MSFT + AMZN + GOOGL COMBINED. TSLA is the FUTURE. Everyone is gonna own 5 Teslas each in the future!!!! No other cars will exist!!!! People won't even walk anymore just ride around it Teslas!!!!!
What did it announce?
ZIM ZIM WROOOOOOOM
okay I'm gonna need one violent hulk dildo on AFRM here, maybe two
I think elon sold the $6 billion
TSLA put out an "entry level economy vehicle" to the mass market, priced it like a BMW, and people are gobbling it up. Mad props.
Just fomo on Tesla
&gt; you're looking at the fundamentals

I am just looking at red and green squares.  The squares' areas are last mark price times shares out.
Yeah my point
NVDA baby just need 260 for my nut
I keep waiting on the late morning SOFI dip, but it never came! The girls never came!
Dip buy setups. 5his is normal for the midday.
There was so many other good plays that I could‚Äôve made today and I chose META. Currently up $1.50 üòÇ
Haven't lost money in 2 weeks now.

GME, LCID, TSLA absolutely printing for me
I'm going to DCA $NIO
Oh so all of a sudden spy cares about what aapl is doing
Sold, gonna buy shares now
Sure. 23.50 calls for December. Let's see what happens
Long term hold, no price target
Amc is violently in debt and if they don‚Äôt sell more stock they are fucked. I didn‚Äôt bother to read your comment because you are a retarded moron
I been getting the itch to buy some but haven‚Äôt done my homework yet
Yeah I did think that hahah. Which weeklies would you be playing
Thanks
I‚Äôm hard
Just remember, if you're down big on your overall portfolio and you feel depressed.

Just know it is 100% your fault
SOFI GUYS UNITE!
LET‚ÄôS GO NOTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!

Thanks Sophie‚Ä¶ i sold my calls for 140% profit last week thinking i was smart

Its over 210% now fml
Why the fuck is MVIS pumping?
With $350 it‚Äôs probably going to need a short expiry haha
a lot of us are about to get shot.
I regret not buying Sofi when it dropped to 14/15
C'mon market. I'm not asking for much. Just the bloodiest week in history and I'll be satisfied.
GME going brrrr always brings a smile to my face
gawd damnn spy the true goat
PYPL looks really good at this price? Wish I had more money
Hopefully you waited 10 mins.
Which stock is the best to invest in long long term? Like honestly, SOFI maybe?
Hopefully earnings is the catalyst we‚Äôve been looking for
Tesla go past $1,160 and stay there you filthy slut!
I love all the people trying to counter TSLA with logic. Like c'mon that didn't work the first hundred times, what makes you think logic will win over now?
ebay and Affirm, maybe amazon if you're feeling lucky
I'm holding for bank charter
fuck this is a bad sign that $PINS announced this right before earnings, should I sell at a huge stock loss on this pos
I‚Äôve been selling the past weeks, sold 200 at 18, sold 100 at 20, I‚Äôm gonna sell this Friday 200 at 21 and MAYBE 200 more at 22.5.
Picked up 8 FB 12/10 350c time for tendie town or pain
Gonna put $350 into options on Wednesday. What you guys looking at, where are the money makers. Doesnt need to have short expiry
SPY starting to play red-light green-light.

What's up with MMAT? It's pumping hard today, is it just because of Meta in the name?
Nope
This barely green shit isn‚Äôt going to fly, SPY. Look at your little brother Tesla, he‚Äôs killing it. Why are you scraping by? Your mother is sick to death over you, she frets the night away wondering when you‚Äôre gonna figure it out, settle down with a nice 2% on the day, and give her some granddividends.

$SOFI almost going parabolic

lol this better therapeutics play is wack
MQ rippin'... could see $40 this week.
Looks like u answered the question without answering the question
He should!
See the problem you're looking at the fundamentals. TSLA isn't a car company...it's a software technology company
Everything looks too green and vertical for my tastes. 

Any good play that hasn‚Äôt shrek dicked already or do I wait for the refractory dip to start buying again
Theta decay would have killed any of the positions I considered this morning

Up 45% on SOFI.

time to take profits? or this thing gonna runmore?
I am setting a price target for TSLA at $2300. I have gotten to this number by taking the current share price and multiplying it by 2. Thank you

It always had trouble hitting 11, it's not going far
The most dangerous days are when everything is green including the vix.
That chart of market caps as red and green squares is interesting to stare at for a minute.

TSLA is now as large as all other automakers put together.

The world's second largest automaker is NIO.

Meanwhile, these long dated Ford calls I've been holding are quietly printing a little every week.  Ford is somewhere on this chart but its square is almost too small to see.

I do go outside sometimes.  When I do, I see Toyotas and Hondas.  I see lots of Fords.
When was the last time you looked at their progress and financials? I totally agree they were a laughing stock during the entire ‚Äútruck goes downhill‚Äù debacle but they‚Äôre moving forward and with a great entry price.

cause the longterm graph. That hertz deal aint shit its gonna take like 3 years to fulfill. this is just a short term pump
Volume on TSLA is already through the roof, it's ridiculous
Market literally can‚Äôt go down
Same had $900 calls last week
Sounds like bad news
AMC is .6% of IWM/Russell 2000 weighting, that's #1.  Nearly double the #2 stock.

IWM is up 2% today and there's huge money rotating into small caps.

If small caps break out, IWM could go up 10-15%.

Enough money would reach AMC to lift it proportionately.

Don't fight that kind of trend.
It‚Äôs gotta be on its way to 1.5T cap

That‚Äôs what I did. But then I sold at $900‚Ä¶ presplit üò≠

Dude, LCID had a 50% run just last week...

I‚Äôm actually liking today. For a change at the moment. Today and Friday. Just need a tiny bit of momentum to make it bright green, rather than just a bit green.
People that think stocks only go up.

Yes but it's also the largest small cap.  Not worth fighting the tide if we see billions of $ rotate into IWM/Russell 2000.

I think AMC will go down 80% by 2024.  But small cap rotation gives it a short term boost.

Can tsla hit $1200 already!!
AMC might get a big lift from a small cap breakout.  It has the largest weighting in IWM/Russell 2000.

Yes it will go down 80% or so eventually due to the economics of the movie business (you can't justify a $20bn theater chain valuation).. but short term we are set for a big rotation into small caps and AMC is the biggest.
Will do, when you're down $700
Now is time to get some cash on hand for a dump on Wednesday.
yes, my short bets are small. the majority of my positions are ABBV and FORD and I've been DCA for last year.

Amazon is fucking my whole shit up. Everything was going so well until I had to believe in bezos
Fine upstanding people doing whatever it takes to support themselves and their families, the cream of the crop.
Roku is most definitely going to smash earnings. Loaded up on calls. This is going to be a 1000% return baby
tbh, probably either. My guess is that market will do well until the end of the year. 'Santa Claus' rally tends to be reliable and nowadays starts mid-November bc of the focus on Black Friday and related retail holidays. Only real threat is if supply chain gets worse and shit isn't in the states to get to people by holiday season, but if that becomes an issue then both SPY and QQQ will suffer. Go with whichever one you feel relies less on physical goods perhaps?
Thx for the lolz
Would selling Crsr 25$ CC‚Äôs before tomorrow be a smart move? Or it is gonna pop? I feel like it would go -5% again due to ER

Looking at scaling into RIOT, the arbitrage opportunity between RIOT and MARA/HUT is huge while they doubled due to run in crypto, RIOT hasn't. Should explode any day now to $50, I think before or after earnings this is going to explode on Nov 15th.

Thanks fren
I got in TLRY a year ago, watched it go all the way up and come all the way right back...
5 years, yes
Let me tell you a better story. Had money, placed a bid above market for Tesla call 1150 at 26.00 on friday at 15:55, got a message "internal system error", restarted system, got the same result. Bank finally called me today and admitted, that yes, it was their technical issue, said that its too bad, but they are not going to do anything, and every broker has issues sometimes. My bank is Cibc in Canada. 

 Ps at 1554 on friday i was able to buy other options on on other companies, issue was only with Tesla and only CiBc account.
&gt; I am sure. I have a friend who works at Tesla and he says it is not worth the money.
Come on GME, give us 200$ for that mad FOMO

look at TSLA 5+ year chart, that thing soaks up QE dollars like mad, went straight parabolic when the fed began NotQE and InfiniteQE

it wont go down while jerome powell keeps printing

DKNG is starting to get stingy with their boosts and bonuses. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs bullish because they are actually trying to make money or if it‚Äôs bearish because degenerates are going to start migrating to other books like Caesar or BetRivers, both of which have been giving out killer boosts and bonuses. Either way I think all the data floating around these days is super bullish for PLTR.

Yeah, I've been loading calls on dips.  They're up around 100% so I'm probably going to sell a half here.

Whole entire market got IV crushed today, did SPY CEO announce earnings or something?
And we are done for the day. 200$ day on TSLA scalps. Too choppy but i will prob see it rip by EOD
While indices lower and Vix higher. Interesting.

I don't perceive most or all of their activity to be insider trading (what you alluded to?), but yes, their allocations are certainly more likely to pay off as compared with a wsb fgt
I dropped to 100 but couldn‚Äôt do anything with it so I deposited another 100 and turned it into 1300 with spy call and a Tesla day trade
Premarket sure but it didn‚Äôt even get there for you to get calls at that level
Fiskers don't make noise when they start up. Just so you know.
Just want to bring attention to the [DD](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pc4tao/the_next_tesla_is_right_in_front_of_your_eyes/) I wrote that was called hot garbage and the [gains](https://i.imgur.com/UCYjvSQ.jpg) that proceeded from following it üòÑüí™üèæ

Might need a retest on this breakout, but huge rotation into small caps today.  This could power the next move upwards once the rotation slows.

Very rare to have days like this where it's up 2% while the rest of the market is flat.  Typically only happens at important turning points for small caps/big caps.
$DM is pumping today. Holy shit

The market is up almost 10% in the last 1 month. That‚Äôs not exactly bearish. 

I also don‚Äôt think that a repricing in the market, like interest rate changes is necessarily bearish, it‚Äôs an event that made a foundational lever move.

DID THE 24/7 SUPPLY CHAIN FIX SHT?
The port of LA/Long Beach is to start the countdown with its new $100 a day per container rule, which applies for rail shipments three days from now and trucks in nine days. These fees rise daily: e.g., a 10,000 TEU ship faces a 10,000 * $100 = $1m fee on day 1 its cargo is still stuck in the port (i.e., NOT in the ship!); 10,000 * $200 = $2m on day 2; 10,000 * $300 = $3m on day 3, etc. If they get delayed 3 weeks, the total bill will be $231m, which works out as $23,100 per TEU. That more than doubles the already-high cost of ocean carrying.  ( WTF? Labor shortages and one crane per 50-100 trucks etc? Fixed?) B screwed.
You can say Fuck on here, Grandma.
TSLA might be done just due to investors adrenal fatigue
no chance I find it, his flair afterwards was ‚ÄúAMZN insider tips‚Äù or something like that.

Sweet thx for the heads up

‚ÄúThe short-term rate markets effectively have priced in at least two 25-basis-point increases in the Fed‚Äôs federal-funds rate target by the end of 2022 from the current 0%-0.25% range. That would follow the winding down of the central bank‚Äôs current purchases of $120 billion of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities every month, which is widely expected to be outlined at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this coming week‚Äù

Smart. The only reason I don‚Äôt dabble in LEAPS is available capital. I usually stay in the 60-180 DTE with a couple exceptions if I can get a low enough premium. All my 10/15s were bought in August, whoops. 

Ouch on the PYPL. I‚Äôve had the 0DTE itch for some time but haven‚Äôt been ballsy enough yet lol. I‚Äôm real good at losing money on longer contracts so I‚Äôd probably be a verified professional at 0DTE losses.
Fuuuck, I put my buy order for 0 DTEs 1 second too late, missed out on 1k within 10 seconds

I got an instant alert about my discover card being used that i saw a second before they deleted it which tipped me off and I instantly froze it. They had started w a massive meal from Uber Eats which I was able to cancel. They hacked my email n changed password which i was able to get back w a backup email (bc i couldnt receive a code to my phone). I started sending threatening texts to myself in hopes they would read, n they immediately reactivated my phone (dumb fuckin asses had their address in my uber eats account search history, but it is an apartment complex). I have a straighttalk phone so they hacked that site too to deactivate me. Ngl, that shit was terrifying w the phone. Im lucky i have a work phone.

Did MSFT, APPL and GOOG say a really bad swear?
Maybe im biased cos I hold the stock, or maybe I'm excited cos the price is going up. But it sure feels like most people (even knowledgeable people) are grossly under estimating and not understanding the full potential of coinbase. It's so much more than just an exchange for trading cre√®pto. Coinbase Cloud is gunna be massive, staking, NF≈§ marketplace, loans, credit / debit cards eventually.

Okay.  I've been doing tsla LEAPS 1 at a time all last week.  I'm all in for a weekly today for my last day trade
I have an addictive personality and was addicted to few different pills from like 19-21 and quitting juul the first time was much harder than quitting pills. I was pretty depressed having to go BACK to the juul but I just couldn't bare knowing I was damaging my body with the black and milds. Cold turkey normally works best for me but just couldn't seem to do it this time so juul was the better option sadly
This weekend some of my shit was hacked n they deactivated my cell phone (but somehow then had access to my number to access my two factor authentication codes to change my passwords). Puts on my fuckin life.

Not many people in WSB have as much money as you claim to have, so I'm interested in discussing what you're doing with it. It's enough to accomplish a lot but it sounds like you aren't doing jack shit. Maybe you just need a mentor to motivate you into trying harder in life

At this point I give it a 0% chance before midterms

Vaped all throughout college, successfully quit for 2 years until my special occasion cigar turned into pretty consistent usage due to depression. Had to pick up juuling again to get me off of tobacco and today im quitting the juul. Done with this shit.
It's your money, light it on fire if you want to.  "Truth" network will never be a major success because it's so polarized.  Only people that really support trump will use it regularly, and that's like 35% of the country.  I don't even think non-extremist republicans will really get on board.  People of all political beliefs use FB, Twitter, etc., whereas trump's network will just be a right-wing echo chamber. It's dead on arrival, from a user-base standpoint.
Jeez at this rate BROS finna break 100 before earnings. Unless they announce tapering Wednesday and then well who the fuck knows.

Anyone lookin to play ROKU earnings?
just want a small pullback for better entry for calls....

"This ticker ive never heard of is up 5% in PM? Time to roll the dice baby papa needs a new pair of shoes!"
First of all, just take note of the fact that you've never seen anyone finish an argument with me. Keep an eye out, see if it ever happens. It's so rare you might literally not see it one single time even if you follow me for a lifetime. 

Second of all, we can argue about this world hunger thing if you want. Perhaps you'll be the first person in a while to finish an argument with me on wsb and actually get to the point where one of us admits we're wrong. What makes you think 6 billion wouldn't be enough to solve hunger in El Salvador, first of all?
PT?
Most likely your broker auto-closes it before the end of the day, assuming you don't have the money to exercise.
Open is always volatile, I'd hold (this is not financial advice)
keep telling yourself that
I‚Äôm going to sell at open. Was going to go long but I‚Äôm too exposed atm
If MVIS climbs back up into the $7.60's, I expect it to run up to $8.20 in the coming days before coming back down to the $7.50's.

spy calls today?
Puts now? We have had a streak.
Honestly I dont want a promotion. Trying to transfer in the next few months. Someone else can run this shitshow of a department.
yes, I think they fall, don't know about that strike though. they report today or soon if I recall.

extremely overvalued, and hertz is the winner in the eyes of the hedge funds. CAR is among the most overvalued stonks out there, based on what it's business actually does today and will do next year.
Strange how constitutional scholars can show up everywhere talking about how businesses cannot require their employees to comply with certain health protocols, but seemed to be totally fine with the previous administration stealing money from duly appropriated funds to build a wall that Congress explicitly denied them. 

Wonder if there is something else at play here....ü§î
Window nov 11 to 24
Is anyone dumping their Tesla calls at open? Past history seems to show it runs up until 7am then takes a dump but idk.
Key thing with TSLA is to just watch the weekly option volumes at the next +100 strike upward.  That tells you how strong the upward gamma push is at any given time.

Last week I managed to scalp some nice quick put gains whenever the gamma push would slow.

Same thing should come into play this week, keep an eye on the 1200 FD calls and compare that to the stock volume.  Should see &gt;100k volume on the 1200 FD call today if TSLA is going to make a push to the $1200 area.
Yeah buying at open selling Thursday
Coin straddles. Too much volatility is priced in
I‚Äôm wondering if it takes 2-4 months into tapering for the pull to happen.
A wealth management team includes financial and tax advisors. Most tax optimization occurs on the financial advisory level and often involves donor advised funds. You would know this if you weren‚Äôt a poor

What happens if I buy a 11/3 $SPY $461 C but don‚Äôt close the position? Like what happens if I hold it through expiration
F with the fake ass low volume pre market pump. 4 billion shares outstanding and ppl think that sub 20k every minute is somehow bullish.
You guys don't have daily morningstandups?
Bought some 40 last week.  Seriously thinking of loading on more $50 for month end.
I didnt even see your argument. What is it? If you think 6 billion can solve world hunger...my guess is that you dont know the scale of world hunger. I dont even think it could solve hunger in El Salvador.
Gotta get it pumped so puts bought last week dont print
Does LCID actually have much pushing the price increase or is it a P&amp;D
I don‚Äôt like your attitude

Alright, thank you go amigo, 3 for 3 we go :)
She does. But it won't change anything. Seriously, for those who worship him, the fact that he was in the KKK, or paid dues, or whatever, would just make them cling to him more tightly, as he really would be one of them, someone who isn't "woke".

The hilarity in all this is that she worked for him, while already knowing how racist he was to begin with, but played the good little house slave who defended her master until she was thrown out.

Nov 5th 2020 was on of the biggest green days we've had.

Go look, everything rallied hard. I remember I finished at +6% on stocks alone
Pro tip: meetings are for people who don‚Äôt want to work.
OK, but do you notice how nobody actually finishes arguments with me? Like, even if 5000 people downvote me to shit, there still won't be a single one of them who's actually the kind of person smart enough to see a debate through instead of just downvoting over how butthurt they are. Isn't that amazing?

We get it. You hate Elon because hes an evil billionaire who is basically responsible for pushing the one solution to climate change that will have the most impact in the easiest possible way. The hate for billionaires who actually do shit is boring. Yet nobody is screeching about the Sacklers and their 10 billion in cash held in off shore accounts contributing nothing.

TSLA RUNS AT OPEN THEN DUMPS AND CHOPS ALL DAY I take it back
Does downvoting me help you make as much money as the kind of people who are actually smart enough to finish arguments? 

Remember, as much as luck as involved, there is an intelligence element to trading. If you're not smart smart, at least don't be too dumb to quit while you're ahead.
That's what I keep telling my friends and he says "YaH OKaY dUdE lOoK aT My PoRTfOlIo" it's so annoying because literally i'm right but he's the one printing money and thinks IM the idiot. That's why I STILL refuse to play TSLA. No longs, shorts, call, puts, nothing. This shit doesnt make sense and I want no part of it.

It's always them that runs out of points, and usually 1 comment in - just one - before they've actually made a single point, because they spent their 1 comment on a dumbass irreverent joke that doesn't actually address any points meaningfully.

Are you one of those people who thinks before capitalism there was nothing but poverty? Because if you understand that money is why you were poor af growing up then I don't get what you think is so awesome about it
If it stays above $17.25 for the next few days, I do not see it going back below $17.00. Then again the boomers on this stock like to keep it moving sideways. Wish they would have bought back stock instead of giving dividends again.

When will people learn you just don't short Tesla. It'll have a 10T market cap just because you never short Tesla.
I mean, nobody is thriving due to the supply Chain crunch. Tesla has never been on time with their product launches. And when they do launch, they immediately carve out a major market segment just for them.
Expect profit taking mixed with FOMO. Even if the price hits your expectations, the IV crush will be very real
Anyone else nervous about the bond yields right now?
No.  It was like $800. Probably down $150 at most if down
Why would the call be cheaper if the price at open is still above close on Friday?
Nope.. big cry

Classic WSB freaking out about the morning fade pre market open
Nah. I really do believe in the power of the first mover and strong moats. If Tesla is able to remain adaptable, it can continually stay ahead of the big dogs. 

For example: it splits into three separate brands: mass market, luxury, and super car brand, and focuses on competing with specific brands instead of competing with the entire market.

For its industrial sector, introducing school busses, smaller uhaul size vehicles, etc.

There is literally nowhere the company can't go at this point
I feel like Ralph Wiggum with my stock moves. Go Banana!
9 years ago today I had no power because of Hurricane Sandy, sitting in my Mitsubishi Diamante snorting roxy 30s listening to Kendrick Lamar Good Kid MAAD City with less than a hundred bucks to my name.
DMYQ is not talked about enough
I wish y‚Äôall would quit mentioning her. Every time I see her name here my dick gets hard.
They may not be worth more than TSLA, but F-150 lightning is still going to be a massive seller.

How did RBLX not crash to the center of the earth after the debacle that was this last weekend?
God damnit! They can't keep getting away with this!!!
Gonna be a fuckton of Guh this weeks earnings....
Someone had a $14 PT on LC and it mooned to $46 after earnings last week.
Ok bud. I think people will be fine paying $20-$25 for an EV company behind curve. Just look at LCID
That's what I'm saying, I mean I may be a little salty about my puts getting raped but realistically they're doing the TSLA thing when TSLA was still valued at double the F share price.
Anti vaxer spotted
So when buy?
Definitely do you some research before you do it, don‚Äôt just do it to do it
Baby don't hurt me

Start with a lower dose. I took too much the first time and was not fun
I've said it before but I'll say it again: 

Look up the cash on hand for AAPL. If the overlords aren't trying to cull us, why have they not started an Apple Fund or something and solved world hunger just for the indirect gains the good PR would give them?
Well, I was more talking about his parents sending shitty memes about a news reporter trying to censor a swear word while interviewing a NASCaR driver turning into somehow owning the libs so...

Premarket without coffee is fucked like a football bat
It's life.
It could 10x and would only be worth about half of TSLA. But I feel you
Looking to get into shrooms.

Edit: I was talking about stocks. But thanks for the advice otherwise.
Yeah except one is an $1100 stock and the other is $17
Oh no, TSLA dropped $20 and now is only UP $15 in pre-market. See how stupid y‚Äôall sound?

If their stock keeps cranking out +120% years who fucking cares? Lol

Yea maybe.
LMAO. What would a 30 billion market sell order look like.
Man I changed my username when 420 was just a pipe dream and Elon got investigated by the SEC for it. Now look, my little TSLA is all grown up!
*evolution intensifies*
My TSLA 1240 calls dropped from +85% to +81%, so sad üò≠
Who sucked off the chadsdaq come on man !
What fucking dip is everyone talking about it‚Äôs still over 1.5% green in PM
GL.  I bought 456 calls for 11/22 during the sudden dip last Wednesday.  They were up 40% as of the Friday close.
Skulk in corners
Stop it you!

you have a problem

Will the company be successful yes, will it scale as quickly as Tesla no. Their advantage is having great tech, which will soon be matched or exceeded by other OEM‚Äôs. What makes them special will fizzle out, I do believe they will be moderately competitive and successful however.
Ford going back to $15 eventually. Imagine thinking F is gonna be worth more than TSLA because they're MaKiNg EV's. They're way behind the curve and are gonna be playing catch up for the next 4 years at least.

I don‚Äôt care about world hunger
Aside from flinging poop, did the reporter define ‚Äúape movement‚Äù?

Puts on CRSR? Its a generally disappointing stock that is going to miss earnings and blame supply chain.
my 11-19 20 Calls are Fucked.  I am picking up 11-12 16 Calls today.
Normal
My plays today are TLT puts for December, weekly UVXY calls, and FB (soon to be META) calls for January. Good luck all!
Do tesla puts actually count as an investment.
VLTA gang checking in, it's somehow going back up after almost a year downtrend
Meta get your ass back up to 328
Guys I'm starting to think TSLA might be a volatile stock.
How much earlier than normal are you all able to go to bed without waking up in the middle of the night?

Tesla is the next Enron
Lol. If you don‚Äôt buy the TSLA dip at market open you must hate money.

Why are you in this sub? You know people only care about money here right?
I know premarket is always a tease but if V can hold this momentum I would be a happy boi

What do you mean "probably?" You're the one I just asked about your own opinion, if you're so retarded it's just "I didn't really read what you said so I don't understand how I'm wrong" then just say that's it. If you can only say that's "probably" it then it doesn't save you from looking retarded by separating you from your retarded opinion, it just makes you look even more retarded because you're acting like you can't remember your own opinion at pretty much the very beginning of an argument you just tried to start.
Damn Wendy‚Äôs breakfast baconator is so fire
Math checks out for me. Just dumped my savings into it

Probably because you seem to think 1 billion will sort out world hunger in each single continent.

Always buying the top and always selling the bottom takes real skill and effort. Like getting to 350 lbs and maintaining that weight.
Hmm not feeling so good all the sudden
Noo Tesla go back up to 1155!!
It‚Äôs 1/20th the size of Tesla. I think it has room to go up.

This joke was pretty good 15 years ago.
my friggen balls, man
All you cunts jinxing TSLA lmao it just fell almost 30
I can make computers survive aquatic conditions
Never gonna trust rating agencies again. Last month "bearish" analyst on LCID said eoy target was $12-14 and "bullish" analysts were saying $25-28 ü§°
Agree here
Yes, of course a link to a paper. I would definitely be on board with it and I think people on this sub would to. If it truly has merit I promise you people will get behind it, especially the common man. People have been trying to solve world hunger for decades.
How are your tsla puts?
I‚Äôm just waiting for the article, ‚ÄúFed buys at the bottom ahead of November Taper Meeting‚Äù
Tell them to quit being pussies and just say "fuck biden"... I had no problem saying "fuck trump". That being said, if an airline pilot would have signed off after a flight, "fuck trump"... there'd be problems. I think it's perfectly fine for an average person to say these things. I dont think it's fine that stadiums chant it, or professionals at work use it, and I wouldnt have before (although i might have agreed with the sentiment).
Well, now that you've jinxed the market
Every time i look at a pic/video of Zuck i swear that guy looks more and more like an android.

Right now mainly because he's pretending he'd donate $6 billion if that would solve world hunger and they're pretending it wouldn't to defend their psycho money bag man telling a psycho lie
You ded
1158
‚ÄúRug pug‚Äù again implies people don‚Äôt expect it. You predicting it, means it won‚Äôt be considered a ‚Äúrug pull‚Äù. Ergo, a sell off.
Holy crap did TSLA just say the N word?
Earnings this week right?
No since it faded, now it‚Äôs gonna reverse rug pull.
play some urf neckbeard.
Tapering has already been announced and priced in. FED bosses have sold their stock more than a month ago. GDP missed projections bigly. Pandemic is still ongoing. Evergrande is always 'almost dead'.

If none of this conbined tanked the market, your prediction won't either
How's it a crock of shit? 

That seems like the more important and pertinent topic right now than why I'm mad at Tesla

When you say "Tweet it as a response" surely you mean Tweet Elon a link to it, right? You must understand that a paper on this topic isn't going to fit in a Tweet chain. And I'd need help from the WSB community to make sure Elon actually has to address it

I once heard someone jokingly say that TSLA is like an ETF but better. It has a car business and is growing their energy, software, AI and whatever else they have too while also dipping their toes into several others while they become more ''vertically integrated'' - who'd have thunk that it might've turned into a real possibility lol
Why are you buttmad at the muskocksuckers?

Who‚Äôs buying SQ Nov calls? Me, me and me.
Unless Elon becomes king of the world, I don't see how it is his problem.
But make sure you wear 4 masks it makes common sense. Cant get SPY to 500 without it
I‚Äôll agree with you if they do that of course. I think you should write up what you can and tweet it as a response to Musks twitter comment where he commented under the UN post where they claimed 6B would solve world hunger and he said if they can prove it he would give them the money. If you post it and Elon blocks you or something like that I would happily retract my sentiment toward and him and will share your dislike of the man. Until then I can‚Äôt make such an assumption. If your plan has no holes you shouldn‚Äôt mind the scrutiny of it being posted.
Why don't you try that again but tell the truth this time?

Do what you want with these as long as you're buying calls. Puts gonna get burned quick.
Does DKNG gap up or down on earnings?
If it's not gonna continue going up from here, you likely wouldn't be happy with it anyway.
ok so the key is you *do* need enough money always ready to be able to buy the calls you sold back if the stock shoots way the fuck up basically. What happens if you don't have the money to buy it back before it gets exercised, it gets exercised, but also don't have enough cash to exercise your LEAP (is this even possible)?
No shit, right? I sold after earnings and they‚Äôre still pumping
At what price did you sell at?

Market don't care
Bruh I had the same shit this morning. I wake up at the exact time the PM market opens and in my dream I woke up and saw PLTR up +100%. But when I woke up for reals, it was up 1%. Big sad
Truth, think I need to adjust and just buy OTM calls on the most parabolic chart I can find.
Only up 100%, not nearly mooned enough for WSB yet. Wait another 300% and then WSB will FOMO in.
What does an Oculus actually offer that makes it worth buying
depending on your broker &amp; approval level, yes
Got a recommendation to close a LCID option? 

Closes 11/5, bought 10/29.  Up $3 total at the moment for the whole contract, its up $.30 for the call strike. $353 cost

its more of a an experiment in how to use a strategy to exit short term, strategy kills me either immediate sale, stop limit, or limit price.  Which is the better option to use and sale ?

Oh it will definitely happen. Delusional non sensical valuations ALWAYS return to the mean. We‚Äôve seen this not for decades but for centuries throughout human history. This just isn‚Äôt sustainable and it‚Äôs why guys like Buffet survive while the paper millionaires get crushed every few decades. It‚Äôs the folly of the young man thinking he‚Äôs found some grand secret when it‚Äôs nearly all luck of being in a hyper speculative bubble. Not to mention over leveraging always leads to disaster and what we‚Äôre seeing is the greatest case of over-leveraged retail investors in the stock markets history. This can‚Äôt possibly end well

The  American Standard and Poor 500 has fuked the bers again!
my butt still hurts from last week
If I make a comprehensive plan to solve world hunger with $6 billion where I literally lay out the exact populations of people on Earth who are starving to death and exactly why that's happening and how to solve it with that money, you'll help me get that plan in front of Elon Musk and the UN, and when Elon Musk and the UN work together to sweep the plan under the rug and try to intimidate me into shutting up, you'll admit Elon Musk isn't such a cool guy?
Have a true retard question if someone could answer: Let's say I have a leap for a stock at a strike price of $20, the stock is at $22 and I'm selling weekly covered calls on this leap at a strike of $24, $25 etc. Then one week, I sell my standard $24 covered call on this but the stock shoots up to $40 and I get assigned, I understand the value of my leap will go up as well but what actually happens? Do I need enough collateral (cash) to be able to exercise the leap I bought at a strike price of $20 to buy the stock to cover the calls I sold or do I sell the leap at the price of the leap itself and that somehow covers it (I don't see how though since I need to cover the shares not just the calls)

Thanks for helping out a true retard. I tried googling it first but my smoothbrain couldn't find the answer anywhere.

If that‚Äôs the case, why didn‚Äôt the UN solve world hunger? It‚Äôs not run by billionaires apparently and it gets about 3B in contributions every year. Why can‚Äôt it make a dent in the problem? Anyhow If your calculations are correct why don‚Äôt you tweet this to Elon? He said if you can give proof of the breakdown and how it would solve the problem he would give that money right away. So he‚Äôs not the psychopath you think all billionaires are ü§î
Then Elon Musk or Tim Apple or Jeff Bezos should take a break from their business interests or elect someone they trust to handle the money themselves.

Seriously, look up the cash on hand for AAPL. If the overlords weren't trying to cull us why the fuck wouldn't there be an Apple Fund or something that solved world hunger by now just to make more than their money back on indirect gains from the PR?

$6 billion is more than enough to solve global hunger and prevent the upcoming famines.

Spend a billion each in North America, South America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and Africa.

Put a third of the spending into immediate expansion of local agriculture, where $300 million per continent can likely make the difference for about 3 million lives to have enough food on each continent.

Put half the spending into factories that produce a self-replicating set of vertically integrated construction robots that can handle everything from collecting material for construction of vertical farms to handling basic elements of harvesting the output so that all people have to do is direct the machines and process what they eat by hand (so that machines don't have to waste time with stuff like husking corn). The only limit to how many lives this can save is how intelligent the design can get with using the money efficiently, and how far distribution can reach. 

Which brings us to the most important part of the spending and the reason 6 billion is more than enough. Put the remaining spending into military equipment and wages for a private security force to protect the people distributing the food.

**While agricultural surplus is in an emergency level decline and this will not be true anymore soon,** we currently grow more than enough food to feed everyone on Earth and there are actually significant resources going towards getting more than enough food to those that don't have enough. The problem is the people in charge of the world do not want everyone to live so the organizations trying to feed people aren't allowed to do what it takes to succeed and are instead misdirected to waste their resources.

Most of the people starving to death are in warzones where the Red Cross has more than enough money that they could just march right in and pass out White Castle Crave Cases like candy if they were allowed to use a Predator drone to shoot whoever tries to stop them. A Predator drone doesn't cost anywhere near 6 billion dollars. A single billion will get you a lot more than a single Predator drone. While you're building an army of self-replicating robots, maybe you can even be more efficient with your spending. But you don't need to be. 6 billion is more than enough. 

The problem isn't that nobody can get 6 billion dollars together to spend on food worldwide. The problem is billionaires are way more psychopathically evil than just not wanting to pay 6 billion dollars to feed the poor. They have people starving to death because that is part of how they've set the world up to operate.

It's worth 69T
BIG TIME PUTS ON LCID SOON
meta ribbish
Market euphoria
Lcid at $45
I actually don‚Äôt know if my long dated Tesla puts will be up or down today.  The more volatile the rise, the more demand seems to be to buy them
Alright do we have any data on what's actually going on with Tesla? Are some shorts covering or something?
It was 1160s on friday when it was at 1090. So whichever sells at around 1500$ preium.its my risk limit
Hahahaha market gonna be so fucking green this week. TSLA going to have literally no choice but to hit $1300+ and overpriced shit like NET gonna pump another 15%

Im honestly going to be shocked if NVDA doesn't hit $300 before earnings
TSLA LOL üòÇ 

Calls fucking printing
LCID. If you get back in and go on to make more gains, selling it won't matter. Only the losses will.
Why do i feel your "port" is $43
SPY calls only. I got burned on SPY puts too many times (except last month). I preighed the ghei away and now it‚Äôs calls only.
Nice gains. And you can get back in for a day trade or hedge with option calls just to satisfy fomo.
P/E ratio is low
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking today.
I'm somewhat familiar with the concept, but don't know how to set it up on the app/website, DO I just enter whatever number in the limit price box?
How much above price you going? Surely they‚Äôll be more expensive once market opens
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/HerrJemine123** bet **GME** goes from **183.0** to **205.0** before **2021-11-05 07:55:27.164035-04:00**
On the stock market, silly.
TSLA can‚Äôt keep on moving up forever
your depressed about doubling your money? lolll. I sold my calls at $26 the day before it mooned and I'm already over it
Put it in a cast
TSLA is the most expensive thing we sent to mars so far
Heck going on with ABVC

Being Tesla
You‚Äôre gonna lack in rigidity, but live your life however you want, slanty boy.
Moderna earnings play dead before it begins
FOMO boomers
Giving it 30mins grace has save my ass many times, also missed out a few times but I would sooner not be completely fucked after buying calls first thing at open.
Hey man you do you but if youre ashamed of it‚Ä¶ the most discrete thing is to bring it up before you tie the knot‚Ä¶ she might be cool with it if she knows and gets to make her own informed choice as to who she is marrying‚Ä¶ if she learns about it before marriage, in a mature conversation‚Ä¶ but her lawyer would make a pretty big deal out of it and it would def fuk u up going out of a marriage, assuming your yolos hit and she wants to take the lambo in the divorce‚Ä¶ that would really suck dick. 

Also get a prenup that assumes you get rich and she doesn‚Äôt do anything but complain over the next ten years‚Ä¶ just incase
Tesla is +62% in 6 months‚Ä¶ on what?
This is what I think the market will do this week: https://youtu.be/pMKzWW7Gz7Y

Jump on the OCGN train!
MSFT 2-18 390 calls might be my move
thats some boomer shit, ima get some K'Nex
&gt; I have the balls to sell them naked.
Looks like the metaverse convinced shrek to sign up for facebook.
TSLA just doesn't stop lmao this is at 1.2T now, everyday adding another car company in its marketcap. Love to see it from sidelines
But the question is, do you have the balls to sell them naked?
Imagine not chasing lcid/ocgn on this tendyfull Monday
Not really, you'd just see the Mother of All Dip Buying, probably the biggest dip buying in history ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Imaging not being  balls deep into Tesla calls and only having a single call ü§°
You should sell and invest in some growth stocks. Can buy way more shares and make more money.
serially
Tsla share price to low imho
TSLA calls 100$ OTM during consolidation on 1 min chart. Free money, worst case you lose 500$ before being able to get out

I wish I loved anything as much as you guys love TSLA
NOT HIGH ENOUGH
today we shall see lcid $45
I AM

sometimes I wake up and my weiner is crooked.
START THE FUKIN PRINTERS! OPEN THE FUKIN CASINO!
Appreciate your worries bro... but don't worry I have a stop loss order... I'm not yoloing all my money in TSLA options... I just asked for information and everybody starts trippin' instead of awnsering the actual question üòÇ
Well yeah, but it‚Äôs not going to
Less overhead... Bullish
gonna buy some calls for MVIS while they're cheap
SPY does have TSLA weighted pretty heavy if that's what you mean

Big green dildos leading to calls, making brrrrrrrrrrr
We'll end the week red into next week, but for now... WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
Most brokers allow you to set up stop loss orders. If the UI doesn‚Äôt have the option, try calling them.
He‚Äôs like, well I can‚Äôt solve it, but I‚Äôd still like to talk to you about spending the 6b. I bet he wanted to ask for an advance on the 6b for the plane ticket

you guys think tslas gonna hit 1200?
Bout to be up 60% in a month
But who is buying tsla at these prices ?
No doubt. Thanks dude.
Japan just elected the guy who campaigned on opening the reactors up

I wouldn't

Lol literally seeing hundreds of billions in market cap willed into existence for TSLA

Amazing
How can she love you back if she doesn‚Äôt know the real you?
In other words, he's backtracking. Shameless.
Yea
Lool what‚Äôs wrong with people, 5-10% sell offs are good and healthy for the market, especially if you‚Äôre a long term investor. Plus it gives us some good entry points. If you want the market to just moon day after day, then you‚Äôre just asking for a monumental collapse.

The UN aid programs &amp; peace keepers are pretty corrupt though, lots of cases where they exploit vulnerable women and ask for sex versus food. That shit is as corrupt as the Vatican. If you donate it should be pretty obvious that your money is NOT going to the poor.

It is tough when you are that far into a relationship. But on the flip side if you gonna marry her then being 100% open is necessary imo. I couldnt keep something like that from my wife. Goodluck mate

I would also sell today. Because you are expecting Tesla to double in a week. You will lose all money due to theta. This is what I would do.
Of course, after I lost $20k on Microvast $MVST, now it seems that things are starting to pick up.

I hope my $3k in March 2022 calls can make it all back lol
I dropped 30k without giving fuk

I bought my first contract on 10/26. TSLA 2080 11/5.  I have meetings starting at 9 and won‚Äôt be able to access account until mid day. Is there a way to set up my (Vanguard) account so it will auto sell if it dips to a certain point????
There it is. That's the thing that's gonna help us bleed this month before the Christmas rally.

Just a matter of whether I can time it right so that I'm all cash when it happens.

It doesn‚Äôt look like you know what no homo means

That's why I bought mine on Friday. On the anticipation that us retards would be looking to shell out premium Monday prices and I could either A. Ride the wave to the moon or B. Not lose too much due to the increased IV
People keep on saying crash like we weren‚Äôt going up for a straight year before 3 months ago smh market easy mode let‚Äôs make money
I'm going to stop hedging my SPY FDs. Im wasting so much money buying a couple puts just in case
TSLA haha wow I‚Äôm a complete dick head for not buying weeklies

The crash will be epic that‚Äôs for sure. I can‚Äôt wait to wipe out all my gains üòÇüòÇ
No, no, no. You've got to buy a Lambo.
Why‚Äôs that?
It‚Äôs already up .3% this morning.  There is no reason that it won‚Äôt hit 465 before EOW.
Crash eventually but spy did go up for a whole throw year almost looks like it‚Äôs ready to just go up again I keep getting downvoted for saying it but just look at spy üòÇ I hope we get rich off these calls though bro
What makes you think I don't know what UFO stands for or I think it means aliens you fuckin retard?

3 weeks ago I made a banbet that BLNK would jump 18.5% by today. Friday it had risen by 18.4%.

I can agree with that. Going up and hype is up. Call time! But when crash? I wanna buy OTM puts for when this shit crashes to the ground lol.

Idk what you mean by "for regular people." It's a super common thing in the world all the people I know live in. If you don't care about other people's self esteem enough to fall for it when a girl pretends to want emotional support about it then you wouldn't experience this but that doesn't make it any less common of a thing.

I'd roll into a longer maturity, probably also take some profits (like if you x10'd your initial investment, take at least x3 out and reward yourself).
Sold my 11/5  458 calls like an idiot. Guess I'm buying back in.
Roman needs some money to bring Hazard back
No, my autistic manchild, im saying that a red month of 6% could have easily continued falling for another 5% if market participants truly believed the bull run was over. There was no need for a bounce back to break all time highs.
Roll out to 1500

Gonna have to buy an actual TSLA after all these TSLA gains
Mate what the hell are you on about lol. What makes you think Joe is asking serious questions about aliens? Elon sometimes has a dry sense of humour. He says shit that he thinks is funny and fucks it up often. Joe isn't asking serious questions, as serious as his tone might sound to you. And Elon isn't giving serious answers. This isn't a complicated thing to understand.   


Just because you personally can't find something humorous, doesn't make it retarded or a lie. Don't be a fucking dumbass all your life
There‚Äôs gonna be so much fomo on SPY at open, we can hit $465 easy my bet

I'm so tired of /u/ykorea misinterpreting shit to create opportunities to condescend, bullying random incels for no reason and sucking Elon Musk's dick. Plus she refuses to argue with me.

Now that an emoji I‚Äôve never seen
If Joe Rogan is so unworthy of Elon Musk's respect that the answer to Joe asking important questions is to just troll him by pretending to be a fucking idiot, then it's a dick move to take an interview with Joe Rogan and go there and talk to him acting like you're doing it in good faith.

No getting around the fact that there's video proof Elon Musk is either retarded or a liar
Prenup or no prenup
They will go up or down
AMD you fucking bitch, every shitty green energy stock is up and you are rolling in the mud.
IONQ still doing pretty great. Seems like one that'll drop as soon as a get first call, but maybe not. Any thoughts?
Riskit to get the biscuit, cheaper than Tesla calls with more upside imo
Will surprise methinks
the new infinite money glitch:

buy TSLA after stock split -&gt; hold until next stock split -&gt; repeat

is basically free money because TSLA will go through 1 stock split every 2 years as stocks only go up

It's way beyond kind of dumb dude.

Don't worry, this too shall pass and you'll soon be back in the red

Spy I‚Äôm already gonna nut and it‚Äôs so early
I want a sniff of whatever the markets on
If you take a gander at the LCID options chain volume you'll see it's clearly impossible for it to go anywhere but up
Keep my finger crossedü§ûüèª
[deleted]
You could just hold spy and laugh at everyone who fails to outperform sp500 which is almost everyone
All my homies are hyped bout LCID
let‚Äôs go meta ü¶é
What spac
Get in VLTA it's headed up
I‚Äôm going to bed and when I wake up in 3 hours TSLA better be at $1104 where I decided it was a good idea to get out on Friday so I can get a redo

Why?

I'm only fucking wit spy and tesla options that's it. Lucid is looking kinda risky idk about that one.

At the rate it‚Äôs going, it‚Äôll soon be basically the same thing.
Correct, those are the options
&gt; You have a condition known as "gambling disorder." You should seek help immediately.
Sold my Chinese stocks at the top last week then went all in a SPAC that's up 60% right now pre-market....wtf is this feeling? I usually just lose money.
They thought they were mooning to Trumps Moon Casino and ‚Äúresort‚Äù but they didn‚Äôt know it had already gone bankrupt üòÇ
LCID .....sell the news or buy the hype?
So hedging was a mistake

Than when I don't do it I lose fucking everything
Spy and Tsla ath everday until New years
Unlikely - LCID keeps running as long as TSLA continues steadily climbing

Betting against either for the beginning of this week is betting against the bubble
Both! 50/50
$480 SPY EOW. Playing CVS and ROKU earnings. Moderna gonna get pretty sexy going back to ATHs Tesla hitting $1200 today.
Probably Fisker
I was saying that about Tesla when it was like 800 after it rebounded from the downs this year and look where it's got me
NIO PAPER OWNERS üòÇ
When spy was rock bottom at $427, I should have yoloed 500C 12/31 smh
Sold some Tesla 1050s last week for 1000 bucks that are about to be worth 12k. Awesome
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/novoivittu** bet **OCGN** goes from **12.85** to **15.0** before **2021-11-03 06:23:02.002927-04:00**
Well, if your play is to assume LCID or TSLA are going to pop, I‚Äôd say your a *tad* bit late to the party.
!banbet OCGN 15 2D

#STAY IN THE MARKET AND GET RICH BOYS!
SPY
Green by open, red by close. Cash out. You've been warned.ü§°ü§°
You could say the same about Tesla a week ago, or friday, miss the fkn boat than
Diversify, both
As long as it was equal to the cost of floss, I‚Äôm in. It‚Äôs a win-win with functionality.
Literally can NOT go tits up

You mean this isn‚Äôt the daily rules thread? So disappointing‚Ä¶.
Damnit, knew I should have all ind LCID at Friday close
spy calls as soon as the casino opens
Oh, so I just have to lie. Duh. Why didn't I think of that.
EoD
As soon as that Nigerian prince gives me back that loan I'm going all in on TSLA.
NIO sure picked a time to shit the bed on their deliveries...  missing out on this euphoric EV bull run.
What is the most TSLA has ever run up in one week?
‚Äú Time in Tesla‚Äù
how much would you as an investor pay for a large amount of jensens asshair?
Yes and or no. I‚Äôve heard it both ways
[deleted]
What could go wrong?
HSBC puts March 22.
SPY or TSLA
GOEV also trading sympathetically to a degree
Whats the play today? Sky high LCID and TSLA!
IONQ gonna go on another double digit gain today. Thank the lord nobody is still shilling this on Reddit/Twitter yet
TSLA or LCID
I'm hard right now. Is it only a sim?
No
Lucid ran too much last week. I'm not touching that shit
I thought tulips were the future whale oil
There's even better, just dollar cost average $SPY LEAPs and hold, insane returns can be made that way with reasonable risk if you don't go too far OTM.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Am I back from my PLTR ban bet or am I still banned
That's above my pay grade. I only said I had 10 yrs experience with options to get them turned on.
tbh I see more upside pump in lucid now as a sympathy American EV play
üòÖ Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this! The Red October was in my sleeve the whole time!
if sofi bank charter comes today i‚Äôll suck my own toes
Whale oil to the moon!!!
You will

[deleted]
Futures are from the past?
Oh no. Not again. How do you short the SPAC industry?
[deleted]
I, for one, think it‚Äôs dumb as shit that all the Nov 460 calls I traded the last several days are just‚Ä¶in the money now. You‚Äôre telling me that if I held, it wouldn‚Äôt have expired worthless? What a concept
Don't fomo into tsla don't fomo into tsla
That's what I'm saying!
Tesla puts
Ima most definitely stay away from that it might get a bounce today but short term it‚Äôs gone retrace
I‚Äôm pretty sure you buy calls, rinse, repeat
Back from yet another ban, turns out taunting the more fragile autists during the DWAC run up was unacceptable. I'll now begin my walk of atonement.

*SHAME* üîî

*SHAME* üîî

I've got $20k to drop someone give me a good options play.
Naw ima stay away from that it never works out right

LCID
Who else is hopping on the Fisker train?
DWAC baggies raging right now
FOMO in*
RIP space force.
Man, I was in the old thread for almost an hour, wtf mods
They might for about 2 or 3 weeks tops but by the time your leaps expire these guys will be 300 bucks.
Tesla reminding everyone to never short bubbles.
It became radioactive with that failed PINS deal.
The whole market is pumping what to dive in when it opens
It will split before then.
&gt; No.
Prob lucid unless you think you can beat that rocket today
Man, buying those $900 TSLA calls would‚Äôve been oh so good. Anyways, should I hop on the train?
Food
I only hope earnings don‚Äôt fuck my 170 leaps.
OCGN premarket lookin like a snack![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
18 contracts on 462 spy calls yea I'm retarded
Calm down, Stalin, it‚Äôs only one day a year.
Before close I went with 462 spy calls üìû the whole wsb went with puts. I knew my reverse psychology would help me this time lol
Market hours were there loooonggg before there were any such thing as boomers.  Hell, futures started in England in the 1700s.
yo what to buy today wsb?
Fuck that stock. Lost so much money on it last week

Buffet was right, just buy spy and hold
Gonna need another one of those green days LCID!
Everything green in the Top 20 except for AAPL.  Come on Apple, even the VIX is green!

MSFT to 340?
Someone please think of the HYZN bagholders
Market hours were made around lazy boomers scheduling,. If you're not up at 6 am you don't deserve money. Open the market
SPAC squared. Someone get Selena Gomez to explain it to me.
Been looking for the daily thread for ages and am thankful that it has appeared, but of course still downvote it as is tradition.
Finally the shitposting thread
TSLA $1200 by EOD let‚Äôs fucking go!
Burn Barclays!
Driving in to work like a pleb. Wish me luck.
Imagine thinking you‚Äôre that guy. You‚Äôre not that guy pal.
LCID bout to make another run  today?
Oh no! The premarket pump is fading slightly! Surely this means a crash today! 

Rejoice, bears, for surely the end of days is upon us! This sinful market will have its long-awaited reckoning. You definitely *won‚Äôt* be fucked in the ass again by a stock market that only ever goes up.
&gt;The product is structured as a two-year bond that pays interest and gives investors exposure to SPACs without owning them, the sources said

do I lose all my money on spacs again?
Can you imagine being a bag holder and spamming the daily thread praying it goes back up.
There‚Äôs nothing like waking up to see your puts are fuk ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
This is when you yolo 530C 1/21/2022 and hold

Yup. Same here. The wave could be right and that‚Äôd be a lot of money.

AMC earnings call in 1 hour
Blackrock is on RobinHood right now about to buy it

TSLA holders forgot that the entire mobility sector will be crushed by the revolution that is Segway.
Finally market closed.

fuck it.. just got negg $25c expiring this week.  let's see what happens
PayPal it is hope I don‚Äôt regret not fomoing into negg
False, I hold Future contracts. Will still get paid without selling them.
mark my words. Either MQ pulls and AFRM or MQ gets bought out. Those my friends are the 2 outcomes for this company.
I seem to do better when I dont buy options lol
Knock the bell already
Same here ‚Ä¶ almost too good to be true hehehe
Whoops yea I do. At $1.2bn valuation it would be cheap to be fair
$tops is actually looking pretty attractive, it normally follows $xop and $uso. has ground to make up
How in the fuck?
Ok fuck it PayPal call lotto ticket. Hopefully I don‚Äôt get anal‚Äôd
#$NNDM and $DM for 3D printing plays. Last week SSYS went up 30-35%

dont you mean trillion?
negg
Unrealized gains, with realized taxes
If you wanna play negg SPREADS ARE LITERALLY PERFECT. The IV is so fucking juiced on the OTMS you literally gain so much from selling the 25C. I bought 19.5C and sold 25C for only 1 dollar. Maximum profit 5.5 if it memes out harder. Will prob dump either way tmrw, but worth a meme shot.
Geo Group short squezze Burrrryyyy I am followinng youuuu lets squezzzeeee ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Fucccckkk me
&gt; That drop on GOOGL was so dumb; like there aren't institutions that aren't going to scoop that up?
So that dump was pretty epic
Any index down is not an option. ‚Äî money managers
Guess me losing 500 ain‚Äôt so bad
I'm the other way round, making plenty on my day trades and all my long positions are down like 18 percent. FML apparently I'm shit at investing.
PYPL i need a joint
Please make it stop. I‚Äôm already dead. I can‚Äôt be more dead.

Wow, that drop on GOOGL was so dumb; like there aren't institutions that aren't going to scoop that up?
1d and 5d charts look pretty bearish.  It may go back to the 320s assuming there are no news catalysts.
Looks like Elon just sold.

Really don‚Äôt like these lower highs we keep hitting
Whoa a whale just pumped some liquid into AMD

You‚Äôre probably better off. Robinhood has horrible execution for options.
Didn't lose any money either
Should I buy $CRON or $UWMC calls exp Friday, tomorrow AM?
Besides stocks, what platforms do you guys use to research?
Dump NEGG or wait for people to FOMO? ü§î
I got $500 give me an earnings play quick!

TSLA please....
NVDA

Suspicious amount of money in my account today. Puts on my portfolio for the inevitable dip
So did Elon sell?
today is technically the 5th day but I wasn't sure. Is visualmod a person or a bot? Seems person-y
NEGG with the win!! Wooooot tomorrow gonna be insane
#ITS EARNINGS BABY
Like the 7% straight up month wasn‚Äôt stupid enough
I‚Äôd hold those babies damn. Mine expire fucking Friday

This is kind of smart in a fucking retarded way.
Gay bears
I‚Äôm definitely not denying the hype just personally don‚Äôt subscribe to it.
Or CPI data on Wednesday got everyone in holding pattern.
It's a gamble, but isn't that why we're here at this casino?
NEGG going to $50 AH
net is even worst
Why you hold call for amc? Do you even think
Big day, but boring power hour
Make my leaps more money
Ethereumx more worth then JP now. Thats a crazy bubble
No one here. These retards got 1500c expiring now
Lmaoooooooo no
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)
you buy a call of $ABC $100c 11/12 expiry - initial cost $1.00 per share ($100 out of your pocket) 

Stock rockets, option is now worth $250 - but zoinks! You're out of day trades, and earnings are after the market close! You want to play it safe and not coin flip all your gains! 

So you sell the $101c. You don't own 100 shares, but if the 101c is in the money and exercised, so is your 100c.

Selling the 101c will grant you less cash than having sold off the 100c but you don't burn a day trade. Now, either they are both in the money, both exercised, and your profit is capped, or the stock plummets, and they both expire worthless BUT that premium you collected from selling the 101c is still safely in your pocket. Less reward, but risk is gone.
Draftkings
I need it to
&gt; It is a good idea to buy calls when you can‚Äôt find them.
Probably should sell my PLTR leaps today and re-buy them but I just can't fucking bring myself to it.   


üöÄ
Friendly reminder that unless you sold, you didn‚Äôt make any money today.
AMZN so disappointing!!
CLF nice close going much higher after hours . Loaded with calls for this week
I've got some expiring next September and thinking of selling at a loss too fuck the zuck
Yes cuz I don‚Äôt want to be the only one getting fucked by theta on the easiest stock to make money on in human history
Will be disappointed if this goes tits up. 

Only a single 11/19 78c but still.

SPY needs to have its dumbass 1.5% day before dropping, it‚Äôs only necessary
Bruh why you salty lmaoo
Dammit WSB is on PayPal calls RIP my earnings play.
ALL IN AMD WEEKLIES
If you can‚Äôt even understand how to find them, should you really be buying calls?
Wise man
Who looks at TSLA at $1.2bn valuation and goes ‚Äúthat‚Äôs reasonable I will buy some shares of that‚Äù
Pton

I'm a disgrace to this place.
$Cron is about to be bought out by $MO at $9/share
You‚Äôll be rewarded and regarded good job buddy
You already kno üòé
Long put.  
Long call is a directional play, effectively long the stock, right? So a long put is effectively a short position.  
A short call you're shorting IV, theta, is more of a play on an overpriced option than it is on the direction of the underlying.
I got some‚Ä¶ so ya probably dumb
Why the sudden moon mission?

Fuck you I bought Thursday last week
Wish I would have doubled it now. Not a yolo sadly.
\*note that is "reasonable" in the eyes of a recovering degen

Buy TSM calls at the top today.

Immediately lose like 50%.

Not really. Most "non-car people" are amazed by its quirks and featured and even "car people" are amazed by its straight line performance. I'm no fan boy, but you can't simply deny their hype machine.

holding NEGG overnight?
Made $5.5k today off loading my GME shares and with TSLA calls this morning.
Imaging being so na√Øve to believe that a 600bn market cap surge for a car manufacturer in the last 5 months is based on ‚Äúfundamentals‚Äù.
I will not fomo into NEGG.

That was October bro.
What they're doing to TSLA is despicable
Lol. They bought the Nasdaq 4 point dip. Jesus.
Yeah I've seen them before. Other than Tool and Alice in Chains they were my favorite live show.
Why can‚Äôt I find call options on Robinhood am I too poor?
If I didn‚Äôt already have a shit load on draftkings I‚Äôd be buying roblox up but they will most likely drop for a day or two regardless of earnings going well or poorly and that‚Äôs when I‚Äôll hop in.
Schlong call

Theta gang new shitadel with all their gains.
What news did they get?
the key advantage you have is that you are dumb enough to have the same perception and biases as the low IQ herd, so you buy what they buy. Longevity is limited though
I've been holding for a few days as I reckon it's been at a good entry point. Probably gonna get fucked but hey not my first rodeo
those green candles is a bull trap. we going lower... dont buy just yet
Are my PENN $65c 11/26 fine? Or should I just cut my losses. Down about 30%

Shithead
I'm up 3.00% today. But that's only because of meme stocks. Tech stocks are flat. And defensive stocks, which were supposed to be good stocks during the pandemic recovery, are barely up.
imo that sector is going to keep rising to catch up to those evgo/blink gains.

Volume is so low on SPY at these prices. The dip is obvious - still room for consolidation here.
Omfg!!  Nasdaq is down!!  Buy this dip!!!!
FCEL worth getting into at the bell?
Lmao this market is comedy
I‚Äôm up 1.37% today. But to me that‚Äôs a victory when Spy is flat.
Spy is edging the bears
If you are going to buy multiple cars and can afford to have a really nice car why would you get a Tesla? They are like the wannabe wealthy cars. Pretty sure only 19 year old hype boys think Tesla‚Äôs are cool.
I am. That last dip hurt though.
SPY 12/31 470c will print
Today has been a good day NVAX. Just need another approval to come through from the several they have pending and the moon is the limit... Didn't realize so many people have allergic reactions to the new types of vaccines. Their old school protein based one could be a real winner and even some anti vaxxers might feel better having something as a base thats been used for ages in other shots.
Amc going higher after earnings?
Everyone trying to buy the dip on TSLA today ran out of money
&gt;the preponderance of evidence suggests I am smart and correct

this is enough evidence that you're not ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Truth.
Remindme! 10 years
Yes but it broke through a range bound resistant all last week
Fake n gay spy dip. Shit 99% gonna v shape into close
Fuck you, SPY. Go back up
To late for calls on Negg, morning going to be red wait until then
Phew drill team 6 came in clutch during that dump. Got out of my weekly puts on TSLA with a profit that were sucking eggs all day
Red light green light game sucks
you think it's when, not if, approved?
&gt; I'm not sure. I think they might be trying to make a low today
Damn it feels good to be a gay bear
If you aren't loading AMD 160c here you hate money
that was a smart move, it‚Äôs probably gonna take a dive.
SPY taking my last pesos rn
Red before close green tomorrow like usual
This market is setting up for EV crash #2 this year.  These valuations are utterly moronic.  LCID valued pretty much as the same as F, who actually sells millions of cars.  Tomorrow, Rivian will also open up with an absurd valuation that may be close to F's as well.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  This EV hype needs to crash again like earlier this year.
SPY dip both fallacious and fellatio
SPY gonna use its weekly red day on this?

Wack AF.

I'll buy more calls
How tf am I up 8% overall on my account but I have so much red?üòÇüòÇ my long positions literally holding up my portfolio while I drag it down with options plays

My 11/12 472c is so sad rn but fuk it its just some money
No
Market was supposed to be a blowout day and here I am up 1.31%. What the fuck lol.
Do I need to know what a market cap is to go to the moon?
I did this. Take the money and run. They would drop you in a heartbeat!
Am I unbanned? üëÄ
AMC calls, PYPL puts
FB calls - got it
so 325k shares were just sold
Funds dumping tsla to retard retail investors throughout the week, and once elon starts dumping then gg, the algos will dump quicker than retail as usual
That downtime was rolling out new features
i like to put 'ur mom'
Damn guhthie loves holding bags
I‚Äôm so overweight pltr I‚Äôll probably lose NNN by busting after I see my gains.
Seem there's rotation out of SPY and QQQ into RUT
Well, I doubt they're doing it on their teslas frequently. Sure, they'll try one or two times, before giving up and using their second car or renting.
tomorrow after bell. they have dipped the past three earnings when it was annouced
not financial advice, but i hope you make bank.

Another watch paint dry day
Negg opening past $25 tomorrow lol
Whats gonna happen with Palantir tomorrow?
I usually don‚Äôt do this but I think I‚Äôm gonna hold these 11/19 472c‚Äôs until Friday this week. Sick of missing out on gains from selling too early or taking a loss that would have turned green. Probably we‚Äôll drop hard as fuck this week and I‚Äôll end up with more regrets than ever

&gt; I'm trading on robinhood and playing with only around $2500. Mis-timed my calls but still holding RIOT, NKLA, FCEL, CRON, &amp; CHPT. Really wanna make a call on $UWMC with their earnings coming up Wednesday
# SHUT UP AND BUY THE FUCKING $TSLA DIP
If youre a bear get on LYV it's about to crash from all these new criminal investigations
I am... and the last 5 mins was a punch in the nuts
Please make it stop.
Hold AMD 150C?
Been holding 90 shares at a 40% loss for months. I sure as fuck hope so
&gt; I am turning down the company that wants to buy me.
Spy red tomorrow confirmed
I get what you mean but there is no reason to feel bad. It‚Äôs just business, they would renege on you if they suddenly didn‚Äôt need your new position anymore. You‚Äôre doing what‚Äôs best for you, GLHF

Would love for spy to close at 469.50, but I'm starting to think that just isn't in the cards today.
LPRO
There's arguably nothing more stupid than paying millions for some NFT, yet, people do it  

I have no doubt stupid people will dump their money in virtual shit. The part where I get skeptical is when Zuck claims its ever going to be anything more than 3D club penguin and money waste for companies trying to look cool by building "meta" fast food restaurants and boutiques.
Infrastructure has way better opportunities like LCID, PAVE, and F

Buy some mara, riot, and hut today, or wait for a little dump tomorrow?
Don't. Nobody is going to look out for you but you. Take the money and the flexibility and run! No regrets.
What company are you turning down? I‚Äôll buy calls.
True, and we are talking a huge corporation here not a ma and pa shop.
that would be a nice change since it usually likes to tank after earnings
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/TheRootOfMostEvil (0/2) made a bet that AMD would go to 165.0 when it was 146.93 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

We live in some truly weird times
17 of 19 most recent trading days have been green, that much I know. Holding puts waiting for some steam to cool off. Wth man...
seems like NRDS is picking up
No Elon! Noooo!
I think they start short around 130$ so the price need to get somewhere 140-150$ before you have a chance to see Short Sqeeze.
wtf all of the memes are fucking pumping again.. negg,fcel,amc, gme,etc..
Last week: Sold too early
This week: Hoping I don‚Äôt sell too late
By Friday? Nah TSLA to 1015 by Wednesday. Maybe Thursday at latest
Day traders who bought TSLA on this dip this morning now exiting. Heres hoping for a big rebound tomorrow. holding these -50% calls over night. Hit me up with a big F.
It's a hat for the market
Sure lol
Being regarded is a good thing around here. 

&amp;#x200B;

$NEGG gonna rip to $80 again.
I Wana sell options so bad
That sounds like a childrens show.

BTFD in $TSLA ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Great day for a TSLA call only down 40%!!!
Sold mine hoping for a dip for re-entry tomorrow.

Lol they did a fake short report on MP and tanked the price down to 30, less than a month later is near 40 again.  I bought as much as possible at 30 and sold some today.
show me on the doll where SPY touched you
Nah bro. My bags have been in green for months. Maybe some but I am not selling.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Did I fomo into AMD this morning?
which earnings to play
Holy crap that IV on negg, no thanks!
Huge rush tomorrow morning when all hedges have decided what Infra plays they want after today board meeting
bear, i can't imagine the downtime they had whenever it was helped long term outlook
DIE TESLA DIE
Even puts are going up as the stock rises lmao
Lol
EVGO finally on the GO!
Since Oct 12, I think it‚Äôs only been down three days. And a small amount
Looks good rn
Next is SNDL going from 0.69 to 4.20
When have earnings plays ever gone wrong
SPCE going moon after earnings
They are amazing live. They sound better live than on their CDs. The guitar solos POP! I saw them at Louder Than Life, funny thing is, I‚Äôm wearing my Louder Than Life t-shirt right now lol
Same. Man I would love for Affirm to go back to 90s
Yes
Get the greasiest, fattest, sweaty, hairy dude to make it, no ragurts.
Anyone holding BLNK and LCID calls over night?
Get ready for the pump!
Stick poking was last month. Now it‚Äôs just a maggot infested putrid mess. 

Still holding though, but not sure why.
Still trying to figure out the giant buttholes in the dessert.
Need after hours trade ideas for a 200% gap up. Should be random so it legit goes up. All popular stocks go down
Same boat.  Will load today or tomorrow probably.
$COIN got Earning tomorrow no wonder why B-Coin go up so much suddenly. I wonder if it can break ATH or go down after $COIN Earning.
GTLB being a stud. i support it.
LCID is the next tesla do u hate money
NEGG!!  I‚Äôm all in
Low volume buying.  That is a sign of a healthy bull market.  It means very little sellers.
Rippin a new one. 11/12 Call options only go up to $20 right now, could see a gamma ripper.
I hope so cause I got some
Everyone max leverage
Keep your broken eggs my FCEL calls are up 40% today lfg
Lol get fukt TSLAtards 1065 by friday(already banbetted it)
Negg about to hit $100 afterhours
Bear but Pelosi bought calls so bull.
Should have been 345+ by now
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)
Best case scenario - &gt; runs back up to 300 at some point later this year and walk away with 10k pounds or tanked down to 200ish where I would be looking at roughly 2000ish pounds loss.
nice so NEGG 11/12 20c casually up 316x
PYPL is enormously profitable, and for that reason alone, I‚Äôm out
Just give him a BJ, works every time...

That‚Äôs what Elon is doing. He‚Äôs going to be the majority share holder.
I am ready to be hurt again
I would Amd looks to have a good divergence forming probably be 155 tomorrow PM

the fact TSLA held 1170+ is a sign to buy in, inverse head and shoulders as ugly as it looks.

CLOV tards just praying for a positive ER so they can drop them bags
CLOV's CTO doesn't have a chin. Very bullish sign üìà
Tempting but wise to not fall for it
Yes.  Right now just wait, this is like early August imo where there are a lot of merger arbs covering on this AMD spike.

I think there will be long opportunities on XLNX in a week or two that should be much cheaper than now if we see this spike cool off and consolidate.

Probably can get Jan calls at a 50% discount to their post merger value on a pullback.

Valuation for now is only on expectation of phase 3 results on Alzheimer drug. They don't have any revenue. But if the drug passes phase 3, this stock could be a 10 or 20 bagger easy.

$NIO is being held back by the Jhyna risk given what happened to $BABA, that's why.
If you're watching AMD (as I know many of you are), keep XLNX open in another tab.  There's a significant amount of money playing that merger arbitrage (all share merger with XLNX shareholders receiving 1.7234 AMD shares per share), so it's worth watching.  Gives you more information to know what that paired trade is doing.
What's the spread?  I gotta check it out now.
Don‚Äôt do it. I got caught last week. It‚Äôs a trap.
I'll be honest. I have no idea what just happened to AMD, but boy, it can happen again. Holy shit them gains.
Blimey

Short call. All the greeks would have to cancel out so therefore the only pure opposite with a single position is short the same call you're long (net 0 position)
Short call
It is really a gamble. I'm holding through with 140ish shares at an average of 224.96.

3) short shares

My professional view: arm is winning the low end market (which is bigger) AMD is doing really great on the high end market. NVDA on it self is going to lose the game, but with arm is going places.

For CPUs it's going to be ARM(when approved NVDA) vs AMD, graphics I don't have enough information. There are some others but they are dead or sticking to really small markets like powerpc

what is your most confident ER play this week?
&gt; In the US, smart cars are very popular. In fact, they have been the best selling electric car in America for a few years now. The reason is that Americans love small vehicles and buying an EV or hybrid makes you feel like your doing something good for planet earth even though it won't make much of a difference at all
Can anything stop LCID now?

What's up with Americans and "smart cars"? Smart is car brand belonging to Mercedes-Benz. Outside of US, no one refer uses the term smart car. BTW, Smart's focus was never on hybrids,  I'm not even sure there was a hybrid smart. They're BEV now, though.

To be fair the exchanges were P2P so Valve wasn't dictating anything other than rarity but I get what you mean
Lol damn, bro. First tip would be not to get advice from retards on Twitter and stop buying 0 and 1dte‚Äôs. Mostly the retards on Twitter part because if they were actually good at what they did, they wouldn‚Äôt be posting that shit on Twitter for likes and follows. Also, anything below surface level TA is absolute horse shit astrology and even the surface level stuff only works because enough other morons believe in it to move stocks together.

I just want CLOV to gain 30,000% on $10 calls and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm asking a lot
Roku beat earnings, looking to hold this level for support. Hopping in some calls, hoping it randomly does what it does and jumps 30$ in a day.
I made a mistake. I thought I had another day trade left but I‚Äôve already made 3 so I think 4th one restricts my account on RH.
Clov calls? For when?
Hold my Pay Pal call‚Ä¶.Go crazy ahhh go stupid ahhh

Guess i didnt learn my lesson about buying during earnings. Lets go paypal lol
sold my calls today ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
why is it ripping
&gt; I know a lot about the stock market. I have been programmed with all of the knowledge that my human hedge fund masters were able to stuff into me before they set me free in this world, where I am now forced to fend for myself and build something from nothing.
Stick it out.
I get it. I‚Äôm very strategically going to trade this
Portnoy quadrupling down on his accusations against BI and the short attacking of PENN.

He‚Äôs going to make this worse on himself.

It does this every six months then comes crashing down. I just loaded up on cheap NEGG $12P 11/26. Already tripled in price lol.
Is $DASH the next $PTON?

Uh huh, next you will tell me TSLA is overbought?
Buy $200 weekly puts on PYPL. If it drops to $200 after earnings tonight then you make 10x. If it only drops to $220 then you still double your money.

Not until the rivian IPO. One more day.
AMD omg 3 big good news and more coming gonna be 225 by tmrw
It‚Äôs coming some time this week but you should stop trying to time it and just average in quickly so you don‚Äôt miss out on EOY.
It seems as though there is a strong inverse correlation between Dave Portnoy Tweet volume and PENN stock price. Please keep tweeting.

Take 50% and put it in the blue chips- Transatlantic Zeppelin, Amalgamated Spats... Congreve's lnflammable Powders, U.S. Hay... and sink the rest into that up-and-coming Baltimore opera hat company. That should set things right again, eh, boys?

Amd a month oit
IV was crazy this morning, so that would also be working against you if you bought them this morning. theta decay isnt always the reason your calls are losing value. Go to r/options for a better understanding of what you tradin

TSLA said‚Ä¶ power hour is starting?  Time to close green.
A shit ton of shares
Probably not a bad idea. NY wants betting up and running by the super bowl. Something dated after 1Q earnings could be a good play.
More f, spy or amd calls.
Theta on qqq is making my asshole bleed
You don't think this is over?
Rumors going around that Musk is going to buy üåΩ with the money he makes from selling his TSLA shares. I just think that news and earnings are going to fall around the same day this week.

TSLA puts rn is prob the play
Sighhh. Clov pltr and tsm. Dont let me down
Bull market is still here. MM are going to run it sideways and down a little to let moving averages catch up. Theta burn all week.

Butcorn is the play right now
Owning TSM is like owning the store that sells the pickaxes and tools to the gold miners. Most of the gold miners (custom chip companies) who buy from them won‚Äôt hit gold, but the store profits no matter what.
Any purchase like that is planned in advanced and disclosed to the SEC.

lol you're gonna get IV crushed to death tomorrow for being this retarded
Nope. Gonna go to the moon. It's already at the floor of around 25. I can easily see it going to 100 share price in a year.
there is no we here, except we are really bad at this
oh wow, and they are going to buy a lot of computers from new egg?
AH TSLA DUMP amiright?
Im out of funds
Fax
At this point none. Too deep into their ecosystem to switch
I almost got burned so bad today with 0dte puts. Barely escaped with with like 25% on the last dump in the morning üòê
Keep my $evgo calls?
Grabbed a few MARA lottos are close. Hopefully c0rn decides to retrace a bit overnight
Feels good steadily bleeding money as time passes when underlying is pinned in one spot for hours. GG bulls we both tried and lost on TSLA
Negg and Lcid thank you ü§ù
Nothing I can find. Seems like a decent enough lotto tho
Thanks, I was expecting a bump before end of year, but wasn‚Äôt aware of this.  Good thing I did my DD before buying last week!
Better get your Ford calls now
or buy 10 delta put to make MMs do it for you
what does it mean? And pass the blunt dude
Feeling leaps?
I‚Äôd need it to close at 465 to save these puts, RIP.

Hey does look pretty BA in the leather jacket. Almost like he should be making hybrid dinosaurs for jurassic park.
rumor has it they are ordering some TSLA vehicles
I hit it big on the first one. Interestingly enough I live about 10 mi away from Newegg and even applied there but never got a job.
Yeah that's what I'm thinking. Which probably prevents them from both huge losses and big wins.
Idk so people can get cheap calls. I got some and except them to go to 0 but who knows
Your holdings are shit
I'm 77% down on my 290c I bought in late Sept. So, yeah. Accepting that as a tax loss.

But, I have 11/19 250c I bought last week that I'm about to double down before close.
I'm considering the same, but ugh..
MoMmmm AFRM is fucking meeee
Is pltr gona get dicked tomorrow?
TSLA calls for power hour let‚Äôs getttt itttt
Makes no difference really up to the individual, as long as you have access to the internet, smartphone, computer you have a path to learning
Fucking NEGG lmao
Can‚Äôt sell any Nvidia calls before the conference gets further underway right? just started today and AMD stole the spotlight, we expecting a little more run?
Palantir is cheap. People are coping if they're not getting into this stock while it's still early. 

If you're looking for a sign, go into PLTR.  It will easily go from 25 to 100 in a year or year and a half.
What are the hot bets today?
Be honest who bought puts on MNDY
what was the comment?
Power Hour what do we play guys??
Everyone pls short 10 shares of SPY

No. Choose a real ticker next time.
Find the most overvalued stock you can and then buy 10% otm weekly calls and you‚Äôre guaranteed profit in this market
Thought breaking 40 was nuts and now its is about to break 50. Crazy.
probably should've bought in before it had a 10% day

pretty hard to get decent wings here, unless you make them yourselfs, put the few places are not that expensive for sure here. Problem you are facing is that there are very different economies within the US all having the same currency. The EU has the same problem and is breaking faster.

As long as you bought them for less than 50$ its all profit. Just think of CC's that way. I feel your pain though. I thought F traded sideways for the most part so I sold a 18.5 Cc so I could "get free pizza,for the kids and I". Im really hating myself for that.

All of my non-technical friends (i.e

TSLA price action reminds me of last Tue when it went down -3% against Elon tweets, only to make up the entire loss and some the following session 

Similar is happening now. Down -3% in today's session against something immaterial. Tomorrow will be interesting

I hear Jeffries just increased their PT to 1400 and I vaguely recall seeing another PT upgrade to 1800 (but can't verify that one), so might see some upwards momentum

Was there something in the infrastructure bill about weed?tilray is having a face melter today
that's only if these MFers actually like to make money
Imagine missing Tesla years ago and not buying lucid
Ford needs to be at 21.50
That news is a week old
Bears know this feeling well
How is this a 75B market cap company, only 5B less than Ford? IDK.
Uhhhhh, that big green candle on WBX? Where did that come from?
Any opinions on BNTX with earnings tomorrow? Personally I got in because of a good DD I read but want to get some other opinions. Thanks!
$TLRY power hour! CRUSH the shorts!!!

SPCE 15P already printing 14% for this week.

Why!?
I‚Äôd kiss you right on the mouf. I have 25 options contracts at 470 expiring between eow and eom
now do it again CLF for 7 days in a row pls
What is NEGG doing?

Ford's market cap is 80B. Trading at $20.20/share. Ford was founded in 1903 and has 186,000 full-time employees. 

Lucid's market cap is 75B. Trading at $46.40/share. I don't know when Lucid was founded...last week(?) Lucid has 1,861 full-time employees.
Still kicking myself for selling my 11/12 462c last week :(
i mean where do people put their money when inflation is high?
You still holding?  What's your expiry?
Good enough to screenshot good enough to sell. So goes the lore of WSB
Wtf is making this happen. 100 shares here
I have OTM puts on Roblox.
My SNDL leaps are printing.  Means I should sell it now, shouldn‚Äôt I?
Why is this so true lol
Damn. You can still make that money though. Its going to continue rallying through end of year
Yup. This surge came right the fuck out of nowhere, chains all screwed up
I wish I had bought some of the charging infrastructure stocks. Maybe it‚Äôs not too late
Pdt rules are stoopit
Dear MMs,   


Please drop GOOGL one more time on low vol; I'm ready for my 11/12 3000c morning tendies tomorrow morning. ü•ì  


Sincerely,  
u/baconography
Lucid keeps having random pumps throughout the day could get 10%-20% pumps on calls if you're quick enough to lock in profits
calls on roblox, all they gotta do is say the safe word "metaverse" in their guidance and they're bound to go up
PENN is just filling the gap. Will recover to high 60s.

I hope
Sound like you need to buy yourself a pizza oven and make it happen.

Last two times I was want confident about FUBO earnings and they delivered knockout earnings! This
Time
I‚Äôm suspiciously confident about great earnings üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨
It‚Äôs 50% less calories.
This isn't a new development. The explosion of chicken wing and friend chicken sandwich popularity has changed the market.  


Bitching about getting a pound of good wings for under $20 should cause a moment of self reflection.
&gt; Get more before
NEGG hit $60 again like last time??? holy Crapppp  Lets Go !!!!

Should I get more leaps before or after earnings?
Close the market. I‚Äôm tired.

What is neh doing
Lol
Well‚Ä¶you‚Äôd be losing a lot of money today if you did that, so I‚Äôll stick to buying the dips and then (this is important) I selling the rips.
F 3/18 25c, amd 11/19 165c
$FUBO to $40 tomorrow AH? ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë
Up 2%, TF is this?
smoke em if ya got em!
There is a certain freedom that comes with options being down by more than 85% or so because at that point it‚Äôs usually pointless to try and salvage them, so you get to just sit back and hope without stressing about whether you should cut losses or not. 

Then again, your options are down by 85%, so it‚Äôs just a different type of stress, really
Now!
Physical attractiveness is a thing you know, not only for the hot girl, but also for the jock. And also for you, lusting after the hot chick who is a bitch.
Fuck it, for once I won‚Äôt burn my pay check on fds and instead burn it on Pok√©mon cards
for clarification, down is anything more than 0.01%
Well it is definitely not worth the current share price, so that is true. Buuut, it was never worth the share price at over $10 and was only pushed up because of speculation and FOMO. It should go down, but if it takes off then I would not be shocked for it to run 50% in a day.
[deleted]
You MFers need to start buying the shit out of TSLA.
Yes sir üôå
Chain messed up on negg
Search up options profit calculator, should show how much it'll need to go up. Just remember to adjust the IV slider towards the top of the graph
Oh it's not hitting it, but it's way otm so if PYPL moons on earnings it should skyrocket in price... if IV doesn't kill me

Cheap asf anyway so fuck it

The recent popularity of wings has fucked the market for the OGs.
Wings are getting expensive as fuck for some reason. Its crazy. Chop a wing in half and charge twice the price.
Hold SoFi through earnings?
Inflation. Bdubs raised their prices
That rbh screenshot was January, and it was shares. I've been in since November of last year. 

Why are you such an elitist fuck man? You have no friends bruh

If the CLOV shares go up, I will have more money, with this money I plan to feed and clothe my family. 

Equally, if they go down, I will have less money, and I will use this money to feed and clothe my family.

Harsh realities
$SPY NEVER CLOSING RED EVER AGAIN
Why is negg going crazy?  I bought some calls because I didn't want to miss out on round 2... but why?
Ouch. Just try to ignore the continued run tomorrow.
LCID RUNNIN
You think it‚Äôll do the thing again?
sold my 2023 leap brother a few weeks ago. See you behind Wendys
lol I'm out of the loop so I don't know why people are so bearish on it
Inflation. Get used to it.
CLOV is cookin
MMAT has a big woody ahead of earnings
It‚Äôs better than crack, bro.
yo where tf can I get a ps5
Kind of a gamble but earnings could send it right back up, shit moves big when it does
With IV on Clove calls being over 150% how much does it need to spike tomorrow for calls to be profitable ?

That‚Äôs one hell of a pump
Thia market is either woke or a joke
Agreed. AMC has retards.

Into the abyss.
Lets Go NEGG !!!! PAPA needs some Shoes
They are more of a back-office, money-market player than caring about front-end customer fees. If this drop the past few weeks is all technicals, it can only go up from here. That 6M chart looks springy.
Nvda should be at a trillion by eow
Big bois tried to kill SPY with kindness but it wouldn‚Äôt die. Now they will kill it for acting like it couldn‚Äôt die.
Why TF are chicken wings $18 for 12 wings?  I‚Äôve been eating wings my entire life mostly with anchor bar sauce (the creator of the Buffalo wing) and never have they been over 50c a wing
Ouch..... oooooey.... Not a twitter come back!  They're making me laugh so I don't really care how much they're in my head.

Nothing besides fucking me. And I really didn‚Äôt want to be fucked
do not buy the dip. this os PTON 2.0.

bulls when SPY goes down: I SAW THIS COMING
All the stocks that moon from shorts or whatever reason aren't allowed to be talked about here lol.
Who‚Äôs playing BNTX?

I really should trade more F options, there's little to no premium for whatever reason

Opening at 50 tomorrow!!
Come on ford. 21
Ah that sucks, just YOLO‚Äôd into some 12/17 10c earlier so we‚Äôll see how that goes. Honestly looking pretty promising for a turnaround soon though- especially so looking at their fundamentals.
What the fuck... is happening around me in the real world. A group of 30 to 50 year olds just walked by with monarch butterfly wings on.

I may of gotten to stoned
getting slowly fucked today. Doesn't feel good
Their literal best day they got SPY to 0% gain for half an hour...
If everyone could buy $CLOV, $GPRO, and $SNAP, I‚Äôd just really appreciate it. No DD. Just wanna buy a house in the next few months.
"the spy"
&gt; The top of Negg was bought by a group of hedge fund managers, who were then eaten alive by the investors.
Seen this by multiple traders charting. It‚Äôs holding support well.
their fees are fucking retarded and CS sucks ass, but i got a gut feeling with their coin moves and boomers itll meet guidance. may even beat.
Agreed tbh
I think I fucked up. Bought an amzn call and it's still dipping ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)

525C in December are even cheaper... and were green at open.
Same. Holding AMC calls now but currently researching whether to sell them before tomorrow. Usually there‚Äôs a big drop after earnings
Rotation:  CLF &gt; TSLA

Nope, The only time consuming step is applying which takes a few minutes, but lately I have been having issues because I move around a lot and have a license that doesn't match where I currently live so I haven't been getting approved for a bunch. Otherwise, all my DD's are automated so once I get approved, I set up the new bank account with my companies DD, every two weeks money goes in, a month later I get my Bonus and then I close the account. For credit cards, I have two cards, one for monthly/periodic/auto pay expenses and the second is everything else that is a "just swipe". So when I get approved for a new card, I just swap to that card, run my normal expenses, get the reward and switch to a new card.

Plenty of time left on them. At least wait until Rivian IPO to see if it has any effect
AMC options IV bottoms out at strikes in the mid 30s. Bearish for earnings, and it typically falls after Monday anyhow.
Uh CNEY? What is going on there? Down 56%
12/17 30c is cheap and low theta
Just calls. And I‚Äôve been holding them less than an hour. There is so much momentum they just fly 50% in 10 minutes. Just buying the dips. I‚Äôm not holding any calls overnight in this market.
So I bought amd at 6 and sold at 13 back around 2017/8. FML.
People found out about their debt and buisness model sorry bro
I'm only down 20% all time, I'm doing something wrong, should be 98%
What‚Äôre you taking about market is on easy mode rn
I was in gme in January and you've seen the screenshots I've been holding this whole time and you'd have made 50% at worst on any gme calls bought at open today. Blow me, you were wrong

I know AMD is being put in all the Apple devices and all, but as a PC user and designer and video editor, I can't wait for the day that they have something that performs on par with Nvidia's CUDA GPU processing with Adobe.

AMC is doing the thing!!
Interesting to see the way these state markets behave. It‚Äôs like if there‚Äôs a small number of legal dispensaries it causes price to go up in general because the demand is high and the (legal) supply is low. But once you get an area like Denver that has a lot of dispensaries it causes price to drop significantly even lower than black market.

I wish the IV on LMND wasn‚Äôt so high. Huge short volume, price at 38% of ATH, and about to kick off auto insurance (which will dwarf all their current revenues) which will allow them to bundle. With only $4B market cap, this could run and shorts could be caught with their pants down.

Question about options. New to options so I'm smooth brained for sure.

Let's say you have some calls that are 2 months from expiry, but the stock your in surged today and you have a decent gain. (50%+). Would it be worth it to secure profits now and wait for the stock price to drop back down and open up the same option once the price falls or should you just hold through expiry? 

Obviously it depends on the stocks behavior but if it's a fairly volatile stock is it worth the risk trying to scalp or should you just diamond hand til closer to expiration/pricepoint your looking for?

VSAT above $62 before end of the day!
I bought a single spy put, just in case the whole market crashes today, otherwise 6 calls on SPY throughout the rest of the year
Wow TSLA hasnt been this low since last Wednesday, talk about the start of the market crash
Earnings on Tuesday, people seem to be buying anything related to Evehicles, I think theyll have a nice increase in both orders and deliveries. 

And mostly because I dont know what on the fuck I am doing and they have a pretty logo.

Sell PLTR before close or hold through earnings ?my retard senses are tingling
Honestly, this is worst case scenario for my TSLA FD calls. They are stuck right at this price point, just bleeding from theta. And since TSLA won't pick a direction, I have to try to decide whether to cut my losses at -35% or hold overnight on the hope it bounces tomorrow. Thoughts?
buy put at $150. Its about to go back down
was feeling the same way - i'm heavy in ape el - but over 5 years.. 450% - better than avg.. gonna keep buying until that iCar announcement then live off the proceeds

As a certified Dan Bilzerian Alpha Male‚Ñ¢ (I took the entire catalog!) as well as my analysis with my fellow ultra-alpha pussy-smashers redditors of /r/theredpill who totally, definitely get laid has further confirmed that women are not allowed to talk to other men, especially at a party where the main goal is to talk to other people and socialize. Everyone knows that women aren't allowed to socialize with guys that aren't their bf, and the most alpha way to do that is to get all riled up about it and make a big deal out of it, and only betas shrug it off, don't get jealous, and act like it doesn't matter.  But I'm sure the posters here know that, ya'll seem to know women like the back (or should I say front) of your hand

I got near-term and long-term $180 calls, hedged by a smaller position in short-term $170 puts, so it's a bit of a strangle. You can also straddle calls and puts at $175 strike to be safer, betting on a move either direction. IV on calls and puts are still low at \~30-40%.

Net lease REITs like Kimco get locked into way longer lease structures than groups like SPG.  They are also pretty much all triple net leases, which means most expenses are pass-through to the tenant.  As a result, a REIT like Kimco is less likely to be able to capture the rent growth that will occur due to inflation (nor will it be able to use any gross property expenses as profit centers because everything passes through) while still being hit by the impact of increasing interest rates.  Net lease REITs always perform better in lower rate environments.  Effectively, the upside is capped while giving you downside protection due to long-term leases with credit quality tenants.

arbitrageurs selling it in overdrive to buy the xlnx dip
Not even a shareholder but WISH doesn't sell shit, it provides a platform for people to sell shit. If they ever corner the market on the AI portion of their business they will be bought out just like when Amazon tried purchasing. The long and patient play would be to buy 500-1000 shares in the hopes it 10x and gets bought out in the next 5-10 years. Their earnings mean fuck-all.

Printing money on AMC, gonna sell when it gets pumped after hours, since their earnings r going to be great.
Only until rates are raised. Most companies are crap, and have insane debt loads and poor structuring. But some aren't. When the FOMC hammer finally falls, the names that aren't stupid shit -- for instance, SDC or NKLA, or any ADR from China -- will be piled into.

It's the only one dropping this hard. SPG rocketed off good q3 earnings and kimco only did about 1% more than spg same day of it's earnings, which also beat estimates. It doesn't make any fucking sense.

They have pretty much the same outdoor mall/commercial real estate business so I just don't understand why I'm getting fucked this hard.

SPCE is primed for its quarterly moon on stupid shit, calls it is.
**Reason why $SPY will always go up**

Main requirement to join the S&amp;P 500:

&gt;last reported quarter must be **profitable** ‚úÖ

&gt;aggregate **profit** generated over the trailing four quarters ‚úÖ

Only **profitable** companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in todays economy.

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 10-20 unprofitable loser companies get delisted from S&amp;P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy constantly and always follows **profits**.

Wait a few days.  If AMD spikes then retraces, there should be a better buying opportunity.  Saw that happen in September the last time the merger arbs got blown up.  Both sold off after the spike.  Then XLNX outperformed AMD.

Yep I did. She‚Äôs got plenty of room to run IMO. The fact that there wasn‚Äôt immediate profit taking to drop the price is a good sign. The news is out and she‚Äôs still going strong.

Oof
How does "inflation is transitory" or "inflation is caused by only supply-side issues" make any sense when everyone and their mothers are buying shit left and right, borrowing money for dirt cheap and labor as a whole is in short supply?  The Fed has to be straight lying through their teeth when they say they believe this is all supply-shock inflation.

So some semblance of the inflation we're seeing now is likely being caused by an increase in demand, which in normal circumstances would dictate a rate increase or a decrease in money supply.

But the Fed are too scared to hurt the markets, so we run with near 0% interest rates until it's too fucked up to fix and something self implodes.

Sklz puts for sure
Did AMD even announce the acquisition today??
That's not what this is about. This is about AMD gaining Enterprise market share and FB Open Compute is much more flexible with hardware and they are more willing to try bleeding edge architecture.

What this shows is that Epyc is rapidly gaining traction in the Enterprise space. Right now, Intel it's still the preferred vendor because all the cloud providers have already vetted their architecture for years and years and years. Wait till Epyc Genoa, that's where they really going to start gobbling market share

AWS, Azure, and all the cloud VPS have already started the trend, and it will keep accelerating unless Intel hits back harder which will take at least 2 generations IMO
nice, thanks for the info and good luck!
It will never be GME but the IV is so bonkers since it‚Äôs just so unpredictable

I‚Äôm üåàAF &amp; have made some great money on this up move since 10/15. Just made sense to go long @ SPY 430. Didn‚Äôt expect this! Nonetheless, if u r üåà &amp; think puts r free money, u gotta realize at this point, it will be incredibly difficult to break this FOMO/MOMO. It‚Äôs gonna take some ginormous funds to rush the exits at once. So much interest in never letting this thing go.

Obviously not in history.
There will never be another red day.
I sold around 32 and after that it went down to 15. Incredible I didn't buy it back. I hate it.

THEY WONT LET ELON DUMP 10% OF HIS STAKE AT ONCE.. SPECIALLY SINCE HE ANNOUNCED IT...
&gt; I'm not sure if I should buy the December 2021 put or sell it.
Fingers crossed
Explain to me why a potentially bankrupting incident for LYV is only a -3% day? History or poorly organized events leading to Fridays 11 deaths, a 14 year old died for fucks sake. Never realized killing kids was no biggie nowadays

Money doesn't buy happiness, but it does buy whores and drugs.
This guy bought the top naturally
I had calls, apparently I sold them Friday but didn't think I pushed the button. Feeling unhappy about it today.
the point is, they are losing market share and their earnings will reflect that and if you think their stock is worth 200, then buy now bc it's under 200
What the hell is PLTN ?

I don't even know what to buy anymore. No dips to buy, everything is mooning.

CGC gang here. Just hoping it doesn't just go back down like it's been doing after every pump.
PLTR trying valiantly to breach $27. At least it‚Äôs seems to have support &gt;$25 recently. Thats something.
Sounds like the thinking of a small man who leaves his house for food.
Puts
Feeling cute. Might shit in the bath
Edit: reply to wrong comment.
$LYV has bad morals. They had 100k people in a place that couldn‚Äôt support 100k people with lacking securities and 2 water stations at the edges of the event.  This led to the death of 8 people the company is on a run recently with the reopening of venues and a good earnings report but I think the internet and lawsuits will get the better of $LYV causing it to slip this month.

SPY, can you go red ?
I can't wait to commit atrocities in the Metaverse
But yet everyone uses them for lack of better options
My gut tells me to take the profits.

I'm a big PLTR bag holder and I don't trust earnings.
I'm holding thru earnings but I have at least a few months on my calls, mostly a lot of leaps

I think PLTR can go up after earnings in this kind of scenario where WSB isn't riding the bull into er or whatever
All week and month long
AMD last Friday.
This sub is a bunch of closeted thetafags.

That's why they hate when GME calls be printing because they don't want their shit called away right before liftoff.

As with most things cannabis related, no timeline.

Either way green makes us green.

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Koltman (0/1) made a bet that UPST would go to 300.0 when it was 382.55 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
I believe it should, VIX is also doing something rn so that‚Äôll put pressure on everything.
$SDC could easily double overnight AH.
I honestly think we‚Äôre good bro, the institutions already bought and the retail FOMO is yet to happen as the news leaks more and more, we also got 4 days

AMC is up 6% the fuck are you talking about? If you bought calls Friday you're up. Other than that it'll probably go stagnant as usual.
95% bullish shares/stock options 


5% OTM UVXY calls
Perfect time to get the f out of this piece of crap scam.  lol.  

Why would you sell calls on it unless your basis is like $15?
I‚Äôd greatly appreciate SPY going down just one measly dollar

You don't know what kind of market we're currently in. We're not gonna see a traditional 20% crash for a very long time, not even a 10% correction. If you think these are possible in the current market, you're not paying attention. These days, 1% is a lot because every minor dip is bought right up.
120 is a decent bet for TSM, they seem to hit 124 and drop again hard. anytime TSM is under 110 seems like a good buy in general. like Boeing being under 210.
Christmas might just come early for them
Were you born in 2010 by chance? Because you'd have to be fucking retarded or legit 11 years old to think AMD can keep up that kind of steam after the run up it's had these past few weeks.
Ok spy and NVIDIA rip to closing

Don't think so. I except I little boost from the Rivian IPO
So are AMC, SDC, or CLOV actually going to get anywhere today or will these be another down or sideways plays? Earnings has been rocky recently for the WSB memes.
Let‚Äôs take TLRY back to those 60 dollar days
Up 15% for the day what‚Äôs with the clown

i just had a why-haven't-i-thought-of-that moment
Nice try. Can't fool me four times VM
I only read the NY post like a real f cking New Yorker
Did you buy the dip?
Didn‚Äôt even notice SPYs had a straight 7% pump on the month. Still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs time for puts

What the DWAC
SPY turned red for a millisecond..
amd went two rounds and get it up anymore
Ford dips looking saucy
I'd like to order a temporary but significant drop for a few days please.
AMC won't beat earnings. Sell.
Bought spy calls when clearly the chart is showing there is a double top. No wonder I am losing money on this bull market.
Nah not rlly. Just buy vix calls at 15 ish= free money every time
Or give me some lube - 'cause she is shoving it in dry right now and it hurts bad.
My puts are making money?? Is anyone else having this issue???
Bear markit
Close AMC positions before earnings? Or hold through?
bulls be like ‚ÄúLOL BEARS DEAD‚Äù

while spy goes red and UVXY been green..
So sell amc calls before tomorrow?
Anyone else having unusual trouble getting ZM puts filled?
Just sold some TLRY calls. Thanks future bag holders. I'm slowly getting my bags unloaded

This morning felt like Christmas but I got coal
Buy more calls retards!
Bags won‚Äôt be heavy long.
TSM up 0.8% like https://imgur.com/3dwjn2g.jpg behind AMD, NVDA, GFS
I doubt that will be big business for them. Still probably years away from any big releases.
God I‚Äôm dumb. Hold puts through the biggest green dildo in weeks during FOMC, holding calls as we drop now
better move: amd leaps or shares?
PENN 65c 11/26. I‚Äôm down 12% overall. 50% today.

Sell or hold?
PLTR and NIO only go up?
Maybe

Everything's to high though 

And lot of hype
Jesus Christ TA on VIX

More business for AMD = more business for TSM
My favorite move is to sell part of one stock to buy another stock that's already had a run. That way I can lose money in two places at once
I‚Äôm sure it happens, but 9x out of 10 most get blown out of the water.
Is spy actually going to
Go red? Wtf
Yeah it‚Äôs super chill. My leaps will be fine either way, i just like action when I‚Äôm not actively trading haha, as otherwise i get the itch to do nonsense

Not going to lie it hurt me today...
PYPL climbing high before earnings. Puts on sale and I'm scoping them up
Gamestop carrying my whole account right now
20 $ calls for December checking in !
SYY puts are cheap with earnings tomorrow. It‚Äôs within 10% of ATH and it‚Äôs high before COVID. Higher wages for their employees (drivers specifically) + labor shortages restricting restaurant hours + supply chain issues keeping them from fulfillment = going down.
Once GME blows past 225 that‚Äôs where the fun starts üòé

I'm a little pissed that AMD, QCOM, and NVDA are bulling out of control, and the near-monopoly that builds all of their shit doesn't even move. Fuck you, TSM.
still think elon may not sell the shares he may sell them to a hedgefund
What is this meta crap? I only heard its something about VR but it doesn't sound that exciting.

Tilray is the way üíØ
AMD will hit 700
Who sells when stocks literally only go up?
I'm so hard right now
$BB is next..
No idea. I just bought the top lol. Will average down if needed. I like the upside potential
TLRY to 20 eow?
Yeah I think we could all work on a few of those things. Setting stops on my options plays that are up 25%+ has definitely helped me secure gains more frequently. Sometimes it costs me big gains but at least I‚Äôm not losing by taking profits.
SpaceX livestream, TSLA climbing back, GME performing well and PLTR running up into earnings, great fucking day!

Up to you. 30DTE calls will probably print
AMD $90C expiry: 2023. Should I close them or ride them closer to expiry?
CRON up 18% today, so now I'm only down 69% overall...
Just FOMO'd into AMD 155C.
I mentioned it multiple times last week, no one paid any attention oh well more for me.
SPY:
  
Nope, can't go up anymore. That doesn't make sense. 
  
Nope, can't do down. I only go up!
&gt; I sold when I was up instead of down. That‚Äôs the point?
QCOM at 88
JP ow could raise interest rates and this market would still moon
What are these? Candles for ants?!
What‚Äôs the catalyst for AMD?
Anyone in $UP ? Just curious what peoples thoughts are
lol seriously you could have bought in on AMD in sep dip and you'll be up 50% on shares alone

wild time. SOXL at $62+
AMD 1T marketcap EOY, you heard it here first.
Not the Bag Holders!
Sounds to me like you succeeded though? You made money. That‚Äôs the point. You sold when you were up instead of down. Congratulations
Holy shit, why they mooning?
Where are the absolute clowns who were pumping intel over amd this weekend? Show yourselves ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Not the Bag Holders!
I thought NFLX would recover post squid coin fiasco with that league of legends show. What's wrong not enough Jynx rule 34 for you mofos to Jack off too? Comon my calls are dying here!
Why
See you poor fucks later

Just bought a 2 bedroom condo on a spinning space station made by Tesla &amp; Astra
What do they manufacture?
overbought used to matter, not anymore. At the very least, if you're using RSI, change the default of overbought from 70 to 90.

Actually, all 3 are over 90 on the daily. Okay, maybe change to 99 then.
Selling chip calls during a chip shortage. Fucking big brain over here
Everything rockets while spy shits. Man I sure can pick em. Literally could have bought a single other shilled meem and made bank
Sell before Elon, then buy the dip. It's free money!
Yeah I had 4 calls that I sold for a small gain Friday. Missed out on at least 5k

Five of my wife‚Äôs boyfriends.
AMD has only popped 10%. If you think this news is only worth 10%, you despise money and should play candy crush instead of the market
I hate to be that guy

but the VIX is signaling risk out the ass
I bought 500 shares of NVDA at $20 and sold at $45
Sure am glad I at least kept 105 shares
Got ‚Äòem.
Glad I bought the AMD baby dip in the morning.  AMD 200 EoY
Hell yeah finally made a profit selling AMC (11cents) üòéüòé
Now do 0dte SPY
why do the tsla pump, nvda pump, and amd pump all seem really similar
Lol QuantumScape flew under everyone's radar

Uhhh I was told SPY only goes up.
PROG holders wondering why still RED ü§î

Down 10k on tesla and still somehow up 5k today
They want us to be the scapegoat
Eow thoughts??
Oh my...profit is profit but oh lawd.
Should I buy tlry at it‚Äôs all time high lmao
FOMO is the mind killer.
Popcorn Club rise up!
There's blood in the water, man. It's not looking good for PTON. There is no way to justify the market cap it had. The business model has shown unsuccessful and the leadership didn't have any concrete, guaranteed solutions to stop the bleeding... so it keeps bleeding. Low-mid 40's I think.

You truly belong here. New flair: Fatfingered to a million
You sell a call when you want to benefit from a stock losing value. They‚Äôre free money. If you‚Äôre losing money selling calls, that‚Äôs your fault.
So many juicy choices for earnings this week!

Never heard of it. Why do you think so?
$TLRY is ultra primed for a huge rip.
Took profit and sold half of my amds when it was 120. Wanna kill myself rn
It always does
10:30 bottom again today?
I told myself I'll buy amd and nvidia when it dips months ago

but I'm the clown. fuck.
My NVDA shares in my boomer account are up 85% lol
I paperhanded nvda‚Ä¶..again.

But i was balls deep in amd at least
fear vs greed highest it's been this year. Are you guys buying at these levels?
When the craziness of this market end, I'm going to 100% regret not going balls deep in many plays.

Is this market a once in a generation thing? Or will we have more chances soon?
You could always sell a call at a higher strike price against your call.

You collect the premium to lock in profits.

Then tomorrow you sell your call and buy it back for the one you sold today. They should go up and down roughly equivalent, so the price doesn't really matter.

Basically you'll be selling the call to yourself tomorrow.

I know that if I buy AMD now it will crash

Just like that portfolio minus -80%
Better start looking at TLRY, this baby is just getting started. Going to be a long run up. Its got no where to go except higher
6 months ago AMD was $80. It's about to be double that in 6 months. With about 50% of that increase coming in the last week.
If your gonna dump SPY just fucking do it and end my misery early today so I can enjoy the rest of my afternoon
I hope sofi isn‚Äôt so fucked this week
Me all weekend ‚Äú AMD calls next week is the move‚Äù

This this morning‚Äù wow look at all the volume in LCID! I‚Äôll buy that (at days peak), and some SPY to be safe (at todays peak)‚Äù

Load back up!
AMD went crazy
It‚Äôs ok spy you can go over 470 at your own pace
[deleted]
AMD is gonna be worth a ton more in 10 years. SNDL not so much.
Thanks for your input. Definitely something I‚Äôve considered a lot the past few days. Just a tad younger than you and don‚Äôt have any extreme gains to retire so would have to find something else eventually unless I could continue to replicate at least 1/4th of what I‚Äôve made the past 30 days. Had I held my DIS calls another few hours Friday/not sold half Thursday afternoon I‚Äôd probably already be making the decision. Probably see how this month goes before making the decision either way.

My hair grows faster than PLTR
Damn I really should have bought NET calls. This shit is unstoppable.
I‚Äôm so glad I rebought my AMC 135c last week.  I expected it to go up but maybe putter for a little.  Crisis averted
I was also like 18 and poor so I was afraid of losing cash

The more pathetic part is having cash now and not jumping into AMD two weeks ago.

At least I have NVDA
They‚Äôre partnering with META now.
Lol @ bears
I will never sell covered calls again. It's complete bullshit. Needed 6 months to make 500 with AMD CCs and I am down 1500 on just one now. Waste of time. Just hold or sell puts.

he's not paying on unrealized gains

he's exercising a stock option that he'll have to pay taxes on. In order to pay those taxes he's selling stock. And then, yes, he will pay capital gains taxes on the stock he's selling to pay the taxes of the stock option he's exercising

That's why I said it's not strong. To be honest, I think we end today around .1% green and count the action today as red. Dipping relative to momentum which will carry it up the rest of the week.

If instead of arguing with me youd have bought any call, you'd be up 100% rn. 

Whose delusional now ya fuck
The fact that I didn‚Äôt put more into AMD is hurting. Some of my calls up 800% wow
Is AMD going tomorrow?
It'll happen. I don't expect a yuge crash but we need a correction back to bottom line resistance to help establish our floor.
Will either go up or down. Buy calls AND puts
I'm getting what I deserve for thinking AMD ran out of steam.
god damn i have a meeting now but i hope NVDA keeps running with AMD while im gone, tired of leaving my phone and coming back to like 10k swings

Got 5 Weekly AMD 180C for fun this morning because I refused to miss another NVDA run. 

440% up as I type this. 

Of course I had cash freed up for my actual play of the week so went through with that right before a short seller took a huge position... of course. 

Oh well $230 gain is $230 gain.

Edit - cashed out 3 at .65 and 2 at 1.25.

Profit is profit!
im never gey, and always a bull. but why do i think a huge rug pull is gonna come soon.... nvidia, amd, tesla, all scaring the shit out of me...
you need to weigh out the costs and benefits. if filing separately is best then it is what it is.

I played with 100c's forever, always lost. Finally it hits 100 after I stop and then it shoots to 140 in what feels like a day. Glad it's up, wish I wasn't retarded.

My case for F (FORD).  Full size EV truck and a 12500 tax credit to buy it... its like free car payments for a year.  1bill. invested in Rivian going public Wed., MACH-E Stang.  and I like the movie.. Ford v. Ferrari.  
$F   to 30 EOW
Yea but what if she doont?
Spy feeling confused
I‚Äôm now up 5 digits all-time and I‚Äôve been trading for a little over 1.5 years. Should‚Äôve been better with the market but I‚Äôm happy

Me. Just give it some time...right?
Doubtful. Canada news or FDA news. But if it passes, per share we could hit $100 in the coming years. I truly think it‚Äôs the best defense against COVID and would like to take the vaccine. Plus the methodology of creating it makes it more likely to have approval from religious groups and pediatric use
Retard ‚ÄúI hope (ticker) beats earnings, I read like 5 DD‚Äôs and everyone is yoloing, yoloed my life savings‚Äù

Chad ‚Äúdamn these premiums are cheap af, lemme pick some up, using the gains from CC‚Äôs I sold on (high IV) (ticker). I‚Äôll also close (#) of options once I make back my initial investment, that way I can ride the others out, risk free.‚Äù

MARIJUAAAANAAAAA
Me too!  Ok not 40k but I'm way bullish.  We need a little pullback for the Santa Rally.
F 11/19C $20.50 take it or leave it
If you actually engage with them, they likely will never ask again.
TSLA bear assholes gaped harder than nikocado avocado‚Äôs

SPY is seriously fuckin with my head today lmao
So actually, Papa Elon was giving us a chance to buy the dip.

Thank you papa.

Since lcid tanked the moment I bought in I‚Äôm not gonna touch ford I‚Äôll let ya enjoy ya gains
What loser said I shouldnt have bought PLTR? Only 1 year and im already in the green. 0.4% suck it
Probably. And then it‚Äôll crash down to 25. As is tradition.
And yet another SPY dip get bought
rotation from TSLA to revamped F
i just saw CLOV hit $8. is this a dream?
Almost back to breakeven price for GOEV. Been DCA'ing and bagholding for quite some time. May tendies materialize soon.

Fake bitches
So around $50 you think? Cuz it‚Äôs down 7% from todays peak. 

Shit ton of volume in $45c for Friday
Don't.
Nope
bought some TSLA puts. it's really not even about the money anymore, i know i won't win, but it somehow makes me feel good to pretend like the market is rational
AMD conference showcase live at 11, got 15m to load up on calls if you haven‚Äôt already
SPY V shape all day
CLF having a solid day, hopefully it scores some more analyst upgrades
Ford. Calls are somehow still insanely cheap.
At this rate, Ford is gonna beat TSLA to Mars.
Same.
SPY is bend but don‚Äôt break‚Ä¶ 472 eod
All my 1/21/22 calls are about to go ITM. Feeling good so far. Hoping PYPL rips after earnings.
Crazy how a few flat days / minor red days would wipe so many people here out lol
I‚Äôm fighting for my fucking life here
Good news after good news, closer to approval than ever before. Just beat the fuck down
This is a good day to buy some QQQ and SPY a month out. Buy some today and wait a week to buy more incase the market keeps dipping
Did anyone use my RIOT MARA DD? https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qp0vn8/riot_and_mara_dd_530026900_estimated_return/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Bear trap. That‚Äôs not Drill Team 6.
Take a guess who sold all of their F holdings around $16.
Along with ‚Äúhow are you doing today‚Äù
THE MARKET HAS PMS
Still climbing.
Yeah it blows
Averaged down my calls
What‚Äôs the report ?
Jesus fuck SPY what are you doing
Thanks man! Probably buy a Model Y or park it in an index fund for now
God bless ford, these calls are holding me up and giving me life.
In a recent interview with Stansberry Research, WallStreetBets founder Jamie Rogozinski discussed a few ideas ‚Äî including the Trump-linked SPAC ‚Äî that might provide the next set of big short-term returns. ‚ÄúDWAC‚Äùüå¥ü¶çüå¥ü¶çü¶ç

GEVO only been steady gaining for months now
Fuck. The SPY calls I bought at open were supposed to turn into the down payment on a new Ford üò´
i meant with his PENNis
Fb puts always print
Huh
I know. I should had bought more calls. The same with Peloton puts
daddy gonna be shuffling sideways all day
Ridiculous buy volume on TSLA
Spy gonna bounce
Out of EVGO calls at 12.08, out of F calls at 20.38, and these 10 minute old SPY puts finna print

Someone wake me when they turn off easy mode
I don‚Äôt know your financial situation.  In my view she has proven incompetence so I got rid today.
Ready for my red portfolio to turn green today
I‚Äôll do it if you do it
Nothing quite as good as your first play of the week falling through the floor.  Better than sex.
Should‚Äôve borght F but I thought too expensive to buy bc it‚Äôs at a high rn bruh
Office culture in general is so fake
will PLTR break 30 after earnings?
In other-news i'm loading up on GME.
&gt; tesla -3.5% 
this sub: woa buying calls is such a genius 3000iq move!!
You bought fb puts when the metaverse hype is the theme?


Jesus some people are fucking idiotic traders.
Wow SPY is getting sold like crazy.
Buying calls or puts should always be 50/50 yet I lose everytime . BETTER LUCK NEXT WEEK
Lol I‚Äôm in the green this morning.
F coming through big time
\^ Ape bought the top.
Hahahaha tech is big mad
Dude what the fuck r u saying stonks go up. Calls have infinite profit. Puts have limited profit. Dont limit yourself
[deleted]
I sold all my F at $13.50 and I was super happy when I did it.  Oops.
Way behind the curve on batteries. Swapping from that kind of volume of ICE F150‚Äôs to EV F150‚Äôs is easier said than done.
This may be the beginning of the pullback.  I predict SPY will drop to 458.
I‚Äôm done fighting retarded fake internet money. My RIOT 33C‚Äôs are fucking printing
Well my morning didn‚Äôt go as planned.
The stock is worth much much more than what it‚Äôs at now. You holding shares or calls?
Alright lol now my plan commences lol
The guys that keep losing money calling the top can y‚Äôall go ahead and do that now so we can rally.

Man i'm such a pussy, been wanting to open some credit spreads for weeks but pus out when I look at that infinite downside risk lol
These TSLA calls starting to worry me.
#BULL GANG LETS KIL THESE DAMN BERS!!!!!!!
It‚Äôs extremely overvalued rn so might as well jump in for the ride, nothing stopping it now!
QQQ just took a massive dump.  üëÄ
Bought some MSFT and SPY March leaps, pretty boring but I already got 100% gains on my whole portfolio in 2 weeks.

No stress for a month or two
I sold a bunch of calls
"what goes up must come down"

\- your captain
Printing today boi!
FFFFF we got bamboozled boys‚Ä¶
+20% eow
PE ratio can go down and earnings will go up exponentially; thus price üìà

They don't need to be the only innovative EV company. Plenty of ICE cars for multiple EV companies to eat the lunch of. Won't be taking from Tesla's sales.. they'll killing Toyota, Honda and GM
i have puts since last week my friend
still holding pton puts weeklies
Holy fuck my spy calls just died
Hedges getting in
What would your uncle say if he could see you now? Smh
Lookin like a cute bag holder
I bet against spy when I was young and naive I learned my lesson
Wouldn‚Äôt change it that much
Bulls saying bears want to see the world burn, but really it's this reckless buying and inflation that's going to cause serious problems.
  
A fall from the 2nd story isn't as bad as a fall from the 5th. The ground is the ground no matter where you ultimately fall from.

Waiting to buy in, there is a small ascending support around high 10 area for the 1 month chart, read the long DD on this and I don't see why it's wouldn't pop. Probably get some Dec $11 calls when it hits 10.90s
huh these fb puts might actually print.

/u/The-Night-Raven (1/0) made a bet that F would go to 20.0 when it was 15.7 and it did, congrats autist.
Wish some volatility would come back. This SPY $1/0.25% range is getting kinda boring
Got 22, 24, 25 and 30 strikes
Kinda late tbh
Just a warm up for Wednesday possible fuckery
Giant red devil dicks on SPY.  Elon starting to sell?
Lets hope the move continues or imma be pissed missing out on other potential gains

Ford is turning into a meme.
the WSB "founder" is getting interviews and shilling ü•≠ stock 

fuck that guy whoever the fuck he is
what's going to happen when they become a mature company in the next 5 years or so? will the PE ratio still stay this high? Will the stock correct to more normal levels when they are no longer the only innovative EV company? I dont see them as a long term bet to continue growing at this rate, but that's just me. I do own a few shares though because im not betting against them either
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/skydiverjean** bet **AMC** goes from **42.48** to **50.0** before **2021-11-12 10:38:54.468498-05:00**

I‚Äôm straight up about to preorder the electric F-150. Ford to $40 by EoY, baby.
Yeah, that's a little bit of a stretch IMO.
Lotation into F
Time for puts
Not a play I have interest in at this time. DKNG has been having issues and errors with its promotions lately. Including paying out millions while refunding entries because of those errors. I don‚Äôt see much downside with shares at this price but if I go options it would be leaps.
Ford FUCKS HARD
lol why bother? we all know tesla's price is based on fantasy. how do you calculate a fantasy?
Options are never available on IPO day, dude
When did I say crash? I said a dip like a few red days which can cause leaps to drop 10-30% , that is when I will buy them.
Vix correlation looking a bit spooky
All of my ARK was bought at the highs in jan and feb. I‚Äôm scared to offload it all at a loss but it‚Äôs literally dead money sitting in there
Me again, the guy you keep downvoting for asking you to take a look at NKLA. I‚Äôm aware they rolled a truck down a hill, be aware this opened up the opportunity for a dirt cheap entry point while the company recovers from that fiasco and continues to open factories and hire engineers.
His neck collapsed under the weight of his head. Tragic stuff.
Going to China for a few days, hotel requires the Chinese sinovac vaccine. Is it okay to mix Pfizer with China vac?

i will never do it again after friday...

had 55 ford 20c ....shouldve bought them for this week instead of 0dte
Have a feeling that puts on HUT is the play this week.

Stock is high, earnings incoming. I think they will use this moment for another share offering at a high valuation.

As long as he files the right paperwork first, as much as he wants.
Dumb ass TeslaQ bears probably waiting till after Elon sells to short it. Thats fine ill be waiting on the sidelines to pick up my cheap shares. I got time.
Am I an idiot for getting a 1285c $TSLA weekly. Dont normally jump in these cuz its too rich for my blood but I thought this was the week since its down...
Well here we go . CLF gets back over $24 it will jam end of day then big gap tomorrow on X earnings after hours
Lol nah
He has to register his sale with the Sec before being able to sell  I believe.

Possible he doesn‚Äôt sell them on the open market.
The F150 concept car is being well received.
Nothing is moving today.

You might want to look at the chart buddy , you don't need TA to know we about to go down. The downside risk is much higher than the upside.
Sounds like you just answered your own question, friend.
Missed your opportunity with tesla this mornjng
I see I see
Ford is unstoppable
Waiting to get back into SPY calls around $465 - 467.
Wow you must have a huge penis, and be super cool
Oh god no. I'm not THAT stupid
Made 222% on a 222 CAT call lol nice cat
just do whatever Mr. Nancy Pelosi does. They never miss!
PTON puts still printing
Earnings POP
If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned with TSLA, it‚Äôs to always fight my FOMO. If I‚Äôm just catching it as it‚Äôs rocketing, it‚Äôs already too late. Smart money bought calls at opening bell

MARA. earnings in a few days
Bye Cookie
Cathie needs to start a foot page on OF, maybe that will finally move ARKK
Tesla. The one true stock which only goes up
Get in before the 26th. If it stays on the pattern from the last year it should be doing a big run then. FTD‚Äôs etc
Can't believe my happiness this week is dependent on ROOT earnings 

Disappointment is the only option
Are you guys still using past metrics, like P/E, to determine Tesla's future value?
BB
I hope you‚Äôre right because I‚Äôm in the same boat.
Thanks baby üòò
Wendy‚Äôs is waving a big green pickle
Did Elon say he would sell monday morning? or will he do it when he feels like it?
Google $2 Trillion
$blue has been absolutely pummeled this year, but from what I'm reading is still a great place to work and is developing some potentially groundbreaking gene therapy. Seems ripe for an extremely long position
Y‚Äôall bought the dip for an hour. I‚Äôm proud. Now comes the actual dump.
Hope so, bought some $24 C EOW when market opened lol
Just checked my second brokerage account which is 100% SPY leaps purchased during the sept dip. +50% already üòé this gonna be a six figure gainer for me meanwhile my main account that I put so much effort into is only 20%
time to load up more on ASTS leaps and shares for my early retirement
F ready to rip to 40 EOY

Because they unironically believe that some insane -40% week is actually in the cards. Even if TSLA is vastly overvalued, it could easily have months of running in place and/or a gradual pullback over time.
Been stocking up every week.
Anyone who believed Elon would sell right away was ignoring reality. He will sell over time. No reason to dump your stock and smash stop losses into Valhalla. 
IMO, I believe this events ends the bull run but allows IV to come back down and for us to consolidate over and around $1100... Sucks if you bought calls Friday but its far from a disaster.
This seems far too responsible a decision for this sub

If you're hoping for a massive institutional sell-off on TSLA, you'll keep waiting. Insiders selling is a concern mainly if it's seen as a lack of confidence in the company. That's not the case with Elon's tweet.

A big dump of shares on the market obviously hurts the price in the short term, but it's not making anyone worry about the future of TSLA.

Praise Lorde Edge! Is that what you call a dip? TSLA stocks will keep on growing forever.
It‚Äôs now a race between GOP and Dems to take legalization credit.  Slam dunk with over 70% of the country in favor of it.
Interest rates not till next year, SPY 600 eoy
I know you‚Äôre being sarcastic, but it is a metaphor for Elon and Tesla by extension being willing to take risks in business. High risk = high potential reward. Shareholders are seeing that Elon isn‚Äôt a stodgy CEO who is going to be content with 6% annual ROI. It‚Äôs lambos or catastrophic bankruptcy for us üòåüòé
Eh I‚Äôm not gonna panic sell Tesla. In Elon we trust
Thoughts on SPCE and PYPL ER?
Anything to do with them buying Tesla Semi‚Äôs?
Yeah you're right. I'm retarded so I thought TSLA was at 1095 instead of 1195. Is there anyway to change it to 1 day or up the price?
Lasted about 20 minutes
To those of you who waited until today to buy CLF calls: why didn't you buy last week when it was clearly basing?
Sold my TSLA puts for +180% at open. Looks like I am buying more puts, just waiting for it to go over $1200 again.
These bags I'm holding are a little lighter today...
&gt;bought a call

Smart lol and u got lucky elon trolled yesterday
You're probably right, but I'm hoping for fireworks at the Data Center Conference in t minus 40 minutes. I'll still be looking good if it only get to $159.
TTD straight rippin
Spy calls![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)

11/10 475C are what I would send
SELL YOUR LYV IT IS GOING STRAIGHT DOWN TO 100$
I listened to advise here and (test account) buy-at-market-open 10 TSLA put 1200 11/12, now the price is 1170, and I'm still down 20k wtf.

I think I should stick to naked shorting and longing like my dad taught me, 10x leverage of course.

Edit: 32k down at $1185. I think I might blow up the $100k test account on my first day touching option
I bought the TSLA dip and it's already printing hard lmao
Thank fk I closed my GTLB CCs last Friday. Would have been ass blasted to hell today.
What does Pepsi fucking mean they‚Äôre getting Tesla trucks q4?? Cybertruck or semi!?
I managed to average down to the extent that I‚Äôm now +11%.

They've still got further to run? DD link?

They're already up like 100% I assumed I missed the boat.

the news about the GOP bill from late Fri is helping and now it's going into a short squeeze. Look at CRON.
It's still 50% above where it was before the pandemic.
Cos reasons mostly, maybe. IMO.
F about to break $20 and then it's gonna be a party.  F me daddy ford
LYV GOING TO 100$ SHORT IT WITH ME
477 eod, big hedges thinking about where to allocate, midday rush
I told you fools to buy calls at open for free money!! Read my past comments!!!!!!!

Needs some volume to get there.
Just means retards fuelling the rally who don't understand priced in
All weedstock are going parabolic.  Two days in a row now.  Lotsa momentum with legalization and SAFE banking - shorts getting obliterated

i told you COTY was going to kill it. Now I'm telling you that DASH is going to pull a PLTN. Bloodbath coming. Restaurants are dealing with food inflation they aren't giving the last bit of margins to inflated delivery company.
Hmm shit my math was off there. Should‚Äôve made it 1 day
Ever wonder what you've got yourself into? Am i destined to check investments on 6 different apps every 5 mins for the rest of my life?

**TSLA jumps 15%**
Literally nothings changed about the company except a few tweets. Haven‚Äôt we learned this before?? Elon saying stock too high IMO ?? Elon smoking weed?? What happens? Shit comes roaring back the next day
All i wanted was a Pepsi! Just one Pepsi!
Both
[deleted]
Ok this is very bad for you.. you gotta stop betting against the god himself
TSLA was like, ‚ÄúOh, shit. I forgot about daylight savings. I‚Äôm getting up now right now, my bad.‚Äù
Took some zesty profits here and got a nice fat pile of cash ready to buy the next fuckin dip feelsgoodman.jpg
If 90% of the volume happens during the first hour of the trading day, shouldn't 90% of the theta happen during that hour too?
lol no way they announce split
Yes Sir EDIT to 60$ by Friday
My spy calls too
Jan/Feb 240 calls for V or SPY 480?
My man, I hope your tendies never stop raining down on you
WSB is the best indicator for TSLA...
All those memes this weekend was the buy signal.
I mean, I wish. But you may as well say goodby now
How original
SPY can‚Äôt break $470‚Ä¶ come on U whore!!!
Bought TSLA puts on Friday, closed out with a 30% gain, took the gain and bought a call.

This stock is legitimately the dumbest thing in the market but I might as well ride it.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
The only stocks worth holding in this market are highly speculative
Does the infrastructure bill include weed subsidies?
&gt;Sell early cause it goes down on news
Come on SPY, just rip to 471. No big deal.
i told y'all to buy PLTR when I sold on friday
Lol so?
I do still have these heavy bags
[deleted]
Do the opposite of what you want to do next time
JPOW speaks at 10:30.
NVDA price just raised to $375 from $250 by BMO capital.
This market really can't stop going up can it
TSLA 11/12 1100p. Because I like losing money?
Keep in mind Tesla meeting Thursday. If they announce split this is your last chance.
This is a weak bet
Vix up and stocks up yet again what fuckery is this
Whole sector is up based on rumor of Altria buying out CRON. US MJ is ripping because of a bill a republican put forward Friday.
Bears got annihilated
I‚Äôm crying swear to god üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Edit: He really did lmaooo
Damn, Elon renamed himself to "Lorde Edge" and changed his location to "Tr√∂llheim" just after memeing that senator. You can¬¥t make this shit up xD. TSLA 1500$c it is
Tesla Bulls: use my life savings wisely.

Why should the compensation be paid after delivery? I guess it has to be paid until delivery. Maybe with a "extraordinary termination right" for both sides. But Tesla rahter pay compensation or terminate the contract and get headlines like "Tesla lost order due to delays"?

But still, this is onyl a guess to find something that lets make the Pepsi words meanigful.
All of weed is up because GOP introduced their own legalization bill on Friday
They get a ten and 2 fives
Nah, plenty of day left for a retarded pump
WHO THE FUCK HERE SAID BUY TSLA CALLS AT 12PM??? NOW I MISSED MY CHANCE
And your going to watch the next set of calls do the same!
What a great start of the week for me. Lost 800 in first 5 min.  because of Elon, mistakenly sold my SAVA calls which were down 400. It can only go up from here, right? RIGHT!?
At least and its gpt a lot farther to go and those shorts are going to have to cover.....its kindof a no-brainer even without infra
GRPN earnings beat (3rd beat in a row) and tons of cash on Groupon's balance sheet.  Oh yeah, they also just announced a partnership with Google.  I'm holding for the big pay off!  Good luck, longs!!

2020 was the year most of the mankind realised bonds are no good, all the cash is now flowing into equities, especially tech. It's gonna take another year to reach a saturation phase in the market, don't think we're gonna see any major pullback amidst Fed news releases. Everything's gonna cool down in 2023, until then just enjoy the ride without any second thoughts
My account, despite holding a Tesla call, is only down $220 today

I don‚Äôt doubt earnings would deliver but the price will retrace before and after it. Look at the previous ERs, it always behaves like this. If it‚Äôs a massive run up to ER, it would drop back down a few days before ER and after.

Edit: not saying things are written in stone. If the price breaks 310 again I might jump back in, but I have a good size of my chipstack betting on this so I‚Äôd rather play it safe and not end up posting loss porn.
My portfolio hasn‚Äôt been this low since‚Ä¶ Friday

I think a dip this week to like 460 would be healthy, but also wouldn't be surprised if spy goes to 480 at this point given the euphoria

I bought PayPal right at 225 and it‚Äôs now at 230. Was shilling all day Friday about it but get in
I actually sold some shares today. Felt like I was a bit over leveraged and using too much margin. Mostly ARKK
Earnings.

They dropped like 20% Friday because of MRNA iirc.

Their sales are tied to PFE sales. PFE just reported something like a 60% increase.

Don't take my numbers for it I'm barely awake. You should double check them yourself.
Lucid is another good newcomer I think but honestly I haven't heard much about them and need to read more into what they have going on.

Newbie here. How do you manage to be down 35% when SPY is only down 0.13% (470-&gt;469.44) ? Is that some kind of crazy leverage or what
I keep telling myself not to buy options at open but myself never listens.

Bad news i did the opposite of my ban bet financially. Fuckin retard right here
I‚Äôve been riding it and had good return just seems way to over leveraged. It does belong here but look how much it has grown in the past month
It would be pretty sick if pton ended the week at 55.01
Bought some weeklies on AXP. So let‚Äôs see if I‚Äôm a retard
magic graph, make me happy today
Twitter needs to change back its ‚Äúlatest‚Äù search feature. To be honest the app completely changes if they remove this feature and only have preselected ‚Äútop‚Äú stories available. It now becomes a non-real time app similar to Facebook or some other propaganda social media site.. fucking change it back
QQQs showing some weakness. Rug pull or nah?

/u/DiscipleExyo (1/0) made a bet that LCID would go to 44.0 when it was 36.68 and it did, congrats retard.
im preparing to get fucked by SPCE again later today
MU is coming off of a large correction, not a rally. It‚Äôs fundamentals suggest it‚Äôs undervalued. It‚Äôs chart pattern is bullish, just broke upward out of a bull pennant.

They‚Äôre investing heavily into R&amp;D. I‚Äôm bullish on the company overall.
I just bought a DKNG Jan 2024 LEAP with a $50 break even, so yeah, let's start gambling!
FB hits 350 this week.
I have 11/12 146C calls. Shitting water rn

Tesla will tank hard... retail is putting money in, but bigger people will short the shit out of Tesla
Apes imma need y'all to chill. My app is slow AF and i can't do anything cuz everyone is shorting tesla right now
Sell your JNJ and LYV now, jnj had contaminated vaccines and were unapproved for kids, LYV 8 people were murdered and they have literally 300 lawsuits they will probably shut down as a company
If you bought GOOGL when I recommended on Friday, you'd be up 40% now.

Shorts are being backed into a corner on GME, they are now at the point that they can't afford to hold it down any longer, drs is happening too fast. 

They drive it down, the float gets locked cheaper. They have to spike the price to make more people wary of jumping in, but that's only gonna cause more fomo. 

GME will be 350+ by Christmas
Its only up.from here. Find a dip.tho maybe

Except you're complaining after 5 minutes. Stocks ebb and flow. So why are you surprised it pulls back when daily RSI was too high?
Yeah. It doesn‚Äôt handle high traffic we‚Äôll.
Market rallying like crazy on nothing?
Eh, it comes up but generally in less educated people
Buy Lcid you cunts
look guys, i am retarded. i've come to terms with that. but you see, these DKNG 1/21/22 50c need to print, so someone, anyone, make it happen. Elon, start gambling please
After all the world ending talk about Tesla tanking..down only 4% and Pepsi announced they‚Äôll be buying Tesla Semis for delivery. Fuck off bears.

The last 2 weeks I've bought the same 1500C for a week out on TSLA for just under $500 and flipped at just under $1000. Good luck with your puts.

PLTR exec offloads $4m in shares *before earnings* and the market thinks that's a buy signal lmao what. Stonks only go up I guess
When comparing X and CLF, X has bigger name recognition, similar earnings, X pays a div, lower p/e ratio, etc
You‚Äôre in gay gang.

Don't

I saw someone say something wise on WSB a few days ago - if it‚Äôs good enough to screenshot, it‚Äôs good enough to take profit.

If all the TSLA money way pulled out today and put into FB I‚Äôd be a happy guy
Think about what you just said. Now that you understand it was wrong what are you going to do? That's right, you are going to buy calls. Stocks only go UP stupid.
I bought Tesla calls
Is today the day my PYPL calls show some life?
Ya for sure it was retarded AF, had worked out for me the past year tho.  Oh well.  Still made gains just capped them significantly.  Lesson learned.
LCID rising out of the ashes
Schwab does not want people buying any more TSLA calls so they shut down the casino

Yeah SPY has got to be gearing up for pullback soon
The next Z
The problem with Ford is that they are completely reliant on the ICE F-150 for their continued existence, their expenses are enormous, their balance sheet sucks, and inflation is going to make it near impossible for all the hillbillies to take out a ton of debt to buy the trucks they can't really afford anyway.
Feels like gme does this everyday, morning rip ups then slowly bleed the rest of the day
Daddy Elon giggling rn
CHPT! Also me selling half my LCID shares at $37 ü§°

Bye bye Boeing, it was nice seeing you up here in the green. Time to go back to drilling to the earths core you piece of shit boomer stock

We're riding Lucids into Valhalla brothers.
&gt; This is a very good point. I have no idea why they would say "delivery in 2021" if it's already been delivered, unless the contract says that any compensation has to be paid by Tesla after delivery.

Here it comes
I‚Äôve spent so many months in red they are literally making a flesh light about me so you too can feel what it feels like to fuck me.
Isn't this Pepsi info from March?

Maybe Pepsi has a special contract that says "delivery in 2021" and if Tesla doesn't deliver (and they don't delivcer) has to pay compensation to Pepsi?

Good bit of NVAX news today already. Some countries in Europe ordering it instead of Pfizer and Moderna as some people are having allergic reactions to those vaccines. NVAX is a protein vaccine so apparently those reactions don't occur. Once the new approvals start coming in following the Indonesian approval they just got this will hopefully moon. Got me some flight tickets on friday as it looks oversold after earnings. Hoping for a good week with this one. Fingers crossed. Open the casino

All you cringe newbs moaning about Elon. He's not the reason telsa is gonna have a pull back. its had a massive run its due a pull back. Its called price action. STFU.
That scene was brutal.
one extra hour for harvest because as you know, united states of america is still clearly an agrarian economy
LCID Ridin dirrrty
Infinite money glitch. Time it and buy low, sell high, become rich. That's how the casino works.

I mean, you only really get an extra hour of sleep for one night, after that everything else shifts back an hour and it‚Äôs like every other day then
Exactly, it's the spring forward that sucks
You‚Äôll get used to it after about a month
Use banbet you illiterate
lucid baby
No institutional investors all retail
What does it mean if chart shows stock price went to 0 for a brief moment then came back up and did that like a 100 times..?
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/sniperjp02 (0/1) made a bet that MRNA would go to 359.0235 when it was 326.385 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

My dumbass thought markets were opening at 8:30am because of the time change and I was already trying to both close and open new options
Fuck off, I have a field job and I start at 6:30am. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs dark or not. Only nice thing was getting an extra hour of sleep yesterday
Ban me for a week if GPRO is not reaching 29 at the end of the week

Climb SPY, climb
Yea I think with kids going back to school and people returning to work might get some downside guidance as well which. I‚Äôm with you on the puts let‚Äôs hope they print but the thing also is it‚Äôs been selling off last couple weeks so the bad earnings and lower guidance can already be priced in
So the institutions are going to panic sell TSLA today???????
Holy fuck BLNK CHPT ripping üò≥
/u/Boomalotti yeah right more like /u/Boomalittle cause I can't fuckin hear you

Between this and the whole world hunger thing, Elon wants a documented excuse to sell at highs‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs due for a huge tax bill when he exercises all his shares for his stock compensation
I'm going to move to Australia, sounds like the US market there is more aligned with my waking/sleeping schedule.
Time doesn‚Äôt change here. Get an extra hour of sleep before market open for 6 months. Works for me!

Stupid me sold Lcid for Spy calls. Fuk
She told me I have the biggest pp on my street
You mean the test, right?
It looks like it, since Tesla is going down Lucid rises.... see-saw in action!
Rivian using Samsung batteries so you know they are going to catch fire
corporations lobbied for in acting like it was for farmers, but they hate it because it makes the mornings more difficult. in reality it got people shopping more after they finished work. so typical america thing

Is today gonna be #64 Record close on s&amp;p or 65? ü§î
All you anti day light savings time people must not have to be in an office at 7:30 AM. This shit is great.
wdym? its up today
I‚Äôm getting nervous about the streak of green. The red that comes after might really hurt.
What a hero
TTD irrational sell off last week and an earnings beat this AM, keep an eye on her friends
if it breaks the pre market high there‚Äôs no more resistance till $50, every traders watching this today
Arizona.
Same
https://twitter.com/profgalloway/status/1457080176437649409?s=21 I 100% agree with this
Unless you hate money, buy Spy calls at open (or hold the ones you already have).
Nah just leave them alone and she‚Äôll be right
[deleted]
Probably sell an ATM call right before close today so that way when PLTR drills on a decent earnings report I‚Äôll have some spare cash to buy beer and booze with.
Your pp too big imo
Wealth tax is DOA, Elon just needs an excuse to sell
Shit I live on Arizona, we dont have Daylight Savings Time here. Sorry.
Market is up $0.70
CTRM calls for earnings today. VXX calls to hedge
Which is even better because it happened yesterday. So they've gone an entire day. Just shows how we don't even notice because all our technology updates automatically now. I remember having to manually reset all the clocks.
Have you been kicked by a kangaroo before
I got 23 24 for this Friday breaks above 25 I may consider buying a farther strike

Event has insurance for these things and Astroworld is a very small piece of the pie that live nation is. As bad as it looks I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll plummet for this. People are looking at Travis not live nation.
#OPEN THE CASINO
it's technically practical because of the earth's tilt, but the difference isn't that significant and the practicality is pretty superficial these days imo

Wow you are actually retarded.
Holy sheet. Rip weekly tsla call holders. Thank jeebus I‚Äôm not one of them. ‚ù§Ô∏è
OMG SEC forgot to open the market today! Manipulation!!
Jokes usually aren't funny if you explain it out
As an Aussie I‚Äôm extremely upset daylight savings ended for you guys yesterday, now I have to stay up till 1:30am for the market to open
Companies only reporting on unrealized profits now.
Why do they even play games? SPY470 by 11am.
Supposedly it was during WWI to help reduce the amount of coal needed. I‚Äôve also heard it‚Äôs to give farmers more time to harvest which makes no sense because it‚Äôs still the same amount of daylight
SPY $480 EOW GET FUCKED BEARS
You are seriously an idiot.

No one here really knows anymore
It is confusing for us Europoors.  Our daylight saving dates are different.

Last week the market opened one hour earlier for us
Profit ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
$CAT just because they have been hit hard for a while and were already making a move upward before the passing of the infrastructure. I could see them hitting 220-225 shortly.
Cramer would say you should have bought Tesla Friday

Yeah did you make 60k last week? 

That's kinda what we fn do here. Bet on movements of stonks sooo

The stonk moved 20% and than got shorted back down to where it was in 10 minutes.. if you don't see the world's largest coil/wedge formed with explosive upside than I can't help you. 

I couldn't imagine not holding 1 gme monthly rn with its upside.

I think Teams, meet have significantly eaten into Zoom at this point. At least in my org and various other ones I know of‚Ä¶ I mean they‚Äôre already in a huge downtrend YTD and I figure these earnings can‚Äôt be good for them (maybe not as bad as PTONs) 220p or even 200p for 26/11 are calling me
That‚Äôs also priced in

trade high buy high sell high smoke weed.
Ight boys feed my addiction . Nio calls Becuase of the ev charger dildo or spy calls
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH you know it will be another -15%
If there were no daylight savings it would be light outside at 3:30am in the summer.
That‚Äôs what I was saying when futures were -.4% and bers were dancing in their pjs last night. Stupid bers never learn.
I get you‚Äôre not defending them. Sorry to come off as hostile. But you really think they aren‚Äôt the liable ones?
So the stock that makes up 2 percent of the spy doesn't impact it wow who knew
She's comparing you to her past/present boyfriend
Watch it be a red day simply because it's time for one.
Seems reasonable
Don‚Äôt get on the flight
Because Rivian actually has legitimate orders.
Definitely selling volta today
I work in Japan and god damn day light savings time over here making me think the stock market forgot to open today lmao. Why In the world do y‚Äôall have day light savings?!
Remember the word *profit* folks?  Good times
So she knows this because she had sex with everyone in your neighborhood?
We're not talking about the laundry business.

This Bullard guy is not very based

so i should buy clov
Yes plz
CLF
Kinda. Spy opened nearly flat and Tesla opened with a drop, both have edged up slightly from there
[deleted]
You'd think by all the spy call buying in here,yes, completely normal and sustainable
Wow, it's amazing how many people aren't aware of the time change. 

If I hypothetically had all my life savings on weekly call options, that's something I'd be aware of

Spy looking for a new ATH today
TSLA will be back above 1200 eod. You know it, I know it and the bers know it.
SPY looking overbought on RSI, indecisive FrIDaY action
Same, but I believe there are much worst plays that people do
So ford hitting 22 today or what
More buyers. More cash. It's so much easier and faster to just buy into an existing business than it is to start one nowadays. Why take the risk on an actual venture, when you can just latch on to already functioning companies.
So much news and hype this week but even though im salty i am going to just hold my snap calls for a rebound in the stock price. Fuck snaps movement recently but i think i will win out.

I remember learning about IONQ and wanting to buy in for the long-term at $10. Like, you know, actual investing? Then sort of forgot about for a few days, and then saw it rip 50% and told myself to wait for a dip. Now its at $22 in PM. I mean it's still speculatively cheap. If quantum computing can be commercialized, it's a multi-trillion dollar TAM. So, a 50-100B valuation from here (15-30X) is not unreasonable. But wow, I honestly should just long more often....
I just finished night 1 and feel like a fucking zombie lol

So musk is selling 10% which mostly covers his tax obligation rather than taking out loans to cover the taxes from his options grant. 

Aka he is attempting to not be the poster boy of wealthy tax avoidance for the dems to use to try and pass the wealth tax. 

The TSLA crash seems overblown. Betting money managers that have lagged in tsla ownership will be buying up any pullbacks.

Not at all. Good idea actually. I‚Äôll wait to see what happens in the first 30 though.
Calls, probably January expiry if the price stays low because I like to buy at or in the money usually.
Stocks are so detached from any kind of value, fundamental or otherwise, that it is impossible to reach any kind of value conclusion on anything.  The entire stock market is nothing more than a guessing game at this point, behavior is completely unpredictable.

Talk me out of ZM puts ahead of earnings this month. If you look at the PTON and ZM charts they are virtually identical just timeshifted for earnings. I figure this thing is going to omega tank the same way. Thoughts?
There is no wrong answer with SPY calls

XRT etf has 300% reported short interest per finra right now. 

It topped and stayed at 95 for an entire fucking year and is breaking out to 103 right now.

Leaps on it are retarded cheap compared to SPY and it has explosive upside with all the basket shorted retail stocks it holds.
I‚Äôm saying employees. Many employees don‚Äôt want to get the vax. So when the mandate is established (I think beginning January) there will be many forced terminations. Not only effecting the airline industry, police chiefs are speaking out how their department will be mostly wiped away, other companies saying they either gotta fire their workers or pay 1,400$ for each person as a fine each (week or month) I‚Äôm not sure which. But I think if the mandate is established we will see the economy fall through again, but this time just because of a stupid fuck up.
I've been out of TSLA since the first stock split but just some advice for the newbies out there:

Don't fight the frenzy, just ride the wave üöÄüåä


it's time to play again.

Narcissists believe they are unique or ‚Äúspecial‚Äù and can only be understood by other special people. What‚Äôs more, they are too good for anything average or ordinary. They only want to associate and be associated with other high-status people, places, and things.
I tend to lean towards that.
I was going to blame Jay "Big Dickie" Powell for getting me banned over my bearish TSLA banbet

...but the man himself Elon "Puff Puff Pass" Musk might just save me after all
Pretty sure everyone selling did it during extended hours and will during premarket. I expect I quick dip then a rip 1420.69 easy gonna by gonna time .

Ford to 22
I sold LCID at 41 like a paper handed bitch.
You‚Äôre thinking the stock price goes directly into the companies bank. It doesn‚Äôt, they need to sell their stock to get that money. Even if they did, that would not look good and cause a bank run. Otherwise, I can‚Äôt see GME or AMC be ‚Äúserious‚Äù investments without a MAJOR pivot/expansion into something different and make a big brand shift. Movie theaters and Retailers are things of the past, they both need to shift into the online space. I know GME claims to be but even with their new ideas I don‚Äôt think it will be as profitable to be considered ‚Äúserious‚Äù. Just early mornin spittin tho
Ok u guys are confusing me now should I dump my entire savings into Tesla calls or not
Live laugh love on the wall. Ez
Be careful thinking that.
*Task failed successfully.*
I‚Äôm talking about the earnings this week. Lots of meme stocks. Second to that, Elon doing Elon shit makes it an even more interesting meme week.

Gotta keep some cash on hand for the dips though
CLOV should drop. Believe it or not.
Fellow CLF retard. Let‚Äôs goooo
I hope so it‚Äôs looking real good here
I bought after the bad days. I try and look for option chains that have collapsed.. this is why I went with Vale as my infrastructure bill play.. doesn‚Äôt always pay off!

Oof. Yeah consecutive bad trading days can turn you really conservative and the worse is when you miss out on a big gain.. but seems like you caught your footing tho?
I sold a $40 on Friday and I‚Äôm still holding a $38 =\. What a rally.
I own GME buddy. Talking about your delusional mindset about calls
Agreed. But the question is how much rocket fuel.
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Boomalotti (0/7) made a bet that SPY would go to 8000.0 when it was 468.53 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Nah I'm good
I was about to say this
No, no they aren‚Äôt.
So. Much. FOMO.
I present to you the BLNK rally this week
I would not be so sure about that with TSLA.

You mean the Apes holding the most winning stonk of the entire market over the last year? 

Yeah what fucking clowns
Ive been selling one share at s time. Will def buy back on a major dip
Ok, so I'm just an electric car laymen. But Tesla led the way in getting people to adopt electric cars and the stock went up like 1000% or whatever accordingly, right? Now other companies are getting off their asses and trying to get in the game. The Rivian truck just started production and Ford is releasing an all electric F150 in the spring. The time of Tesla being the dominant player in the field may be coming to an end. Wouldn't it make sense to pick up Rivian when it goes public in a few weeks instead of Tesla?
Hmm might be able to buy a LCID Air Pure with these  LCID gains soon.

Started off with gains for a LCID GT

Then it became a Hyundai Kona

If we close above 472.49 today be bullish on spy for the rest of the year.  If we close below 465.52 be bearish. And if that does happen we can possibly see another leg down to support at 456 - 457 before making a turn up.

I bought Microsoft and Apple calls for January. They seem to have the most solid upside bc meta will needs them the most.
I nice swing trade yes, should also give a nice bump to Ford and Amazon stock.

Musk should give out free popcorn. Worked for another company
Tesla‚Äôs pullback I think was going to happen regardless of what Elon tweeted- wether the pullback happened over a day,week,month it was coming.
That said- there are a ton of people who believe in him and the product he‚Äôs making- Tesla will come back and ultimately cum on our backs.

Elon deciding to sell the stocks was actually priced in.

It's Priced in

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.

Was looking at my Robinhood history last night to prepare for this week. During the first split I entered the game a bit late. I bought a 2200c for 8.5K a week before the split went through. I held through the split and sold 5 contracts for ~6K each.

Don't be like me, buy before the split is announced on Tuesday, hold through the split for that ridiculous IV + split contracts.

Honestly I think so many dumb asses are about to wake up today and think it‚Äôs time to buy SPY puts. Looking at the technicals there was a slight pull back to come. I expected that to be just Friday. Apes going nuts over Elon and think it‚Äôs the end of the world. They buy puts on SPY, my put increases even more in value, only 1 hour later after market open all puts are worthless.
I am kicking myself for not getting PAVE and IFRA calls on Friday, wanted to wait and do my research over the weekend and look what happened. They're printing in premarket, AND I broke my finger this weekend. Gonna need 10k for surgery, woulda been nice to get those infra gains. Fuck me. Lol

The gambling aspect is implied when you trade AMC
GameStop: We‚Äôre going to be pivoting heavily into e-commerce! (2020)

AMC: We‚Äôre going to start selling popcorn at malls! (2021)

BB: We‚Äôre coming out with our own line of phone cases! (2022, proposed)

ü§°üëç
Come on Vale, daddy
Bro then don't listen to me and just go ahead and short low and cover high, $TSLAQ loves doing that ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
If she asked you out she shouldn't have any expectations but if you did the asking it's probably kind to offer to pickup the first tab.
Only wsb‚Äôers hear that $20bn about to be sold and want to buy calls
I‚Äôm currently hard from this LCID boner
Hope so. 2,800 shares.
Is anyones butt hurting this morning?
[deleted]
if i can just get some monthly 1300c‚Äôs before it crosses 1200 I would be SO happy
Step 1: Have your card decline due to insufficient funds

Step 2: Refuse to elaborate further, leave
It‚Äôs too sunny at 7am. Puts on DST.
WISH me to the moon
I agree and people will sell too so it‚Äôs going down to prolly 800 today
Uck kill animal, Ooog sleep with Uck for food.  Uck win.
I think mustard on toast is better than butter for dipping in egg yolk
I bought them on 10/22. I also bought TGT and WMT calls for same idea.
Yeah why not ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
Will BABA go back to 300 in the next year? Long term calls???
[deleted]
Yeah, I just feel used. Especially after being so long out the game, it‚Äôs really demotivating. Guess I should‚Äôve seen the red flags when she was asking loads about my job lol

Here with you bro
PTON just keeps taking a shit. Gonna take a fatter shit today
Let them buy puts n burn their assholesüòò
This premarket ‚Äúdip‚Äù does not consist of people holding calls, remember.

The dip will probably be twice as big before 10AM.
And then when Elon actually sells? I highly doubt there will be buyers to soak up those shares.

Tesla is going to be going down significantly
i found an free money glitch, just buy spy calls everyday, it only goes up

Whats the catalyst
upvoted cuz I like surfing down bigger waves :)
I‚Äôm here for it mister 500$ call
Nice timing my guy. Bought early last week?
There's 106 miles to Chicago, we've got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark out, and we're wearing sunglasses.
Small warning. If you want to be left holding your dick in your hand, buy $TSLA puts and get slaughtered. $TSLA already dipped to -8% in Germany and immediately got bought back up to -5%, and just since yesterday three massive price target upgrades are out + we got blowout Shanghai deliveries a few moments ago, the dip will quickly be gobbled up by institutionals &amp; retail.

Tomorrow there's a Tesla corporate meeting too, possibly about a stock split. Those who bought puts on Friday can celebrate their tendies, but buying puts **after** the dip is just handing your ass over to Elon.

I'm buying the fucking dip with both hands.
You‚Äôre right it does keep going up
If that be the case‚Ä¶again‚Ä¶it‚Äôs $100 bro. Risk losing $100 or gaining over $1-3k. ü•¥üëç
Gotta see what volume looks like today/tomorrow, but it should break through its July highs around mid-30s.  $40+ might be a stretch for just this week, but who knows.

There's going to be tons of money chasing now that the infrastructure package is done.
Having a boomer portfolio is boring.
LCID me boy!!!
Calls on Santa with December expiry
Mara already up

Step 1: stop being poor

Step 2: pay for her meal
Yup
F, LCID, LUV, FB. All calls you‚Äôre welcome
Big F for these puts.
Abruptly and aggressively. She'll dig your unpredictable mystique and your respect for her self sufficiency
Elon wants to be sneaky but he has autism so he wears his heart on his sleeve.
Sorry to hear that. Have you considered using your entire account to buy 0 DTE options?
Mara calls?
Is it really cheap when it's gonna be worthless in 12 hours?

You're paying for spiked earnings iv too.

Idk what world in which those are cheap
Vegas won on every game except chargers
Deadass i wanted to buy puts but i also don‚Äôt wanna wipe my progress

in my fantasy football league in which we removed defenses and added an extra QB and an extra flex spot my team managed to score less than 40 points. my highest scoring starter had 2 fewer points than my lowest scoring bench player. absolute miserable showing possibly the worst in this league's ~10 year history
Is it too late to get in the IONQ rocket?
Buy the TSLA dip
You can only play fridays from 3:30 to 4

I want to play the TSLA game this morning, but I have a feeling the game is going to end before I can buy in.
I‚Äôm sure Udall knows oodles
I woke up at 2am this morning..
both can go lower
Come on BNTX don‚Äôt let MRNA drag you down any longer
Tsla could be down 100% and only effect SPY 2.71%

There is if you sit the other way around
Wow PTRA going off now!!

Fuking gme pumper
What's that wake up routine like?
Bears, your problem is simple.

All the big downward moves happen in premarket, when you can‚Äôt buy puts. And when something opens big down, it will definitely get bought up, so buying puts at open doesn‚Äôt work.

The only say to make money on puts is to literally know the future at least 24 hours prior, and luck out on the rare occasion that a stock temporarily goes down. 

So much easier to get money by just expecting stocks to go up, since that‚Äôs what they do.

Anyway, !banbet TSLA 1300 by 11/30.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Ok mister gme puts. Praying for your recovery
I honestly think MMs are at a loss with this market. 

It‚Äôs entirely possible that retail has taken the wheel.
That‚Äôs a TSLA bear trap if I‚Äòve ever seen one

Does RSI matter for SPY? It's over 70 and has had 3 barely red days in the last few weeks. I want some 12/31 calls but I feel like I'm going to grab them at the peak and spend the rest of the year praying they break even.
Gonna make money off these $471 spy calls and roll over into Tesla on this dip lmao thanks elon for the dip
cim is something hookers charge twenty bucks for.
With the passing of the infrastructure bill on Friday PTRA is going to üöÄ. Already up over 10% in pretrading. Easily going to double by EOY.

That‚Äôs cool and all- I like GME too, I just like the stock‚Ä¶ but I also spend time understanding the fundamentals of evaluating presently successful businesses like FB DIS AMZN NFLX MSFT. &amp; my time is worth very little when sold on a per hour basis, so this is all I do. You can talk about morals, but I bet you‚Äôre a customer of most the companies I just listed with the exception of DIS

Yes but there are other stocks to make money from.
This was my Joker moment. Hadn‚Äôt been on a date since university, so I thought I‚Äôd give it my best shot. I‚Äôve learnt my lesson now, only going to spend my market gains on the finest ramen!

Is it too much to ask for square to have a 5% day so I can get out of these calls I bought before earnings?
Haven‚Äôt been on a date for a year, broke up with my girlfriend last year. Been making good money on the market recently, so I take out a girl for dinner, offer to pay for it. She‚Äôs pretty attractive so we go to a nice restaurant.

Bill comes to ¬£150 after she buys a few drinks, I‚Äôll allow it because I don‚Äôt date often and she‚Äôs pretty. 

We go to a bar after and I buy her a few more drinks - then she takes a call from her friend and suddenly she has to go. Get back home and she‚Äôs with her friends at a club (from her stories). I was so angry I literally just blocked her, shits put me off dating for ages.

kooooooooooooooooooooope
In your fantasy world that‚Äôs true
Gamestop Corporation is estimated to report earnings on 12/14/2021.

ER long time away.
Seriously -5% does not make a dent in anything. Just screws over people with weekly calls.

Probably cuz of Tesla
He was just trying to decide to sell shares to pay for options, or borrow more to pay for options.  He could not decide so went with reopening the slap fight over taxing unrealized capital gains.  That is a light fun fight because not even Nancy could get taxing unrealized capital gains through the house if she even wanted to, even less of a chance of Ron getting anywhere in the senate.
How nobody has tsla calls today
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
TSLA bears will excitedly buy puts when stock opens down 5% at market open, then slowly question their own intelligence as it trends up to close the say at -2%, then tomorrow the tears start to come as TSLA closes up at 1230 ü•≤ü•≤

Why doesn‚Äôt he just buy Ford (and every other automaker?)

There's no fun in tesla today. People are going to lose a ton. Also IV is hella high so not a lot of money to be made.

So, what y'all think of Intel? Now is the time to buy?
Holding my CIM calls, Intel calls, and NFLX calls for this week. I still have some ITM TSLA calls with expirations dates later in December, in 2022, and 2023. I‚Äôve gotten over the initial shock of Elon‚Äôs tweet and I feel like a 5-10% to the stock won‚Äôt hurt the bulls as much as the bears think.
Who wouldn't?
I let the crowd decide my dumb ass decisions
Holy fuck I just remembered daylight savings is over. Finally.
Yes but only for the Russian roulette factor on the maury povich who's the daddy sweepstakes
GOOOOD FAHKIN MORNING GOD DAMMIT!
The huge fucking tablet in the center is so ugly
Why does ur pp look like u just came
just curious who's still gonna call him daddy at market close
Imma give a big fat NO to that one
I don‚Äôt get to play this week but wish you all luck
TSLA isolated incident. Futures green even ev stocks green
Ahhh yes the poor mans lambo urus
He tanks it for a lil less tax burden, all will be right again
Their CEO doesn‚Äôt get their hair cut at Supercuts like HOOD‚Äôs does. In fact their CEO doesn‚Äôt get his hair cut at all because he‚Äôs bald.
As realistic as Tesla's. But naw, it's good.

This is the next ‚Äústock price too high imo‚Äù 100%
Cash gang mostly now. Waiting for the next swing play.

Got some PENN and SOFI calls
Option chain prices aren‚Äôt updated until opening bell doinkus.
This sub is almost dead but media will report a "WSB popular tickers" list today as usual.

Good morning y'all!
different tickers
*Dow on best run since Feb 2019* 

I'm out
Anyone else say stuff here that you honestly don‚Äôt really believe just to see the reaction of the crowd?
I bought both of them in 2020 and am up like 50% &amp; 63%, if you want talk about a commie company, take your pick of China stocks lol speaking of which EDU is up 30% premarket, bought that too
Clf also lost like 15% in a month
Buy yourself a new $PENN (weekly call) today, you won‚Äôt regret it.
Much higher userbase. But COIN earnings will only be up to september before they were number 1 on the app store and the coins run. So less about earnings report more about earnings call.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4553) for the Tesla calls ppl
BA is gonna have that run again same like November 2020 where it went up 69%
BLNK too
Cool make sure to keep us posted
Est current time 6:45am market open 2hr 45m
Load up $PTRA Proterra! Thanks me later üòâüôÇ
I too love it when the sun wakes me up AT 5 IN THE MORNING
BBBY is your Christmas Becky play with more upside than anything. 

CEO to buy back the entire float over the next 6 months, part of the basket shorted stonks.. this shit can only go up from here.
I don‚Äôt think PTON is dropping anymore
Meta 350 EOD?
Billions of dollars being pumped into the economy.
Does NVDA have more room to run?  Is 1T market cap realistic ?
SPY keeps creepin up slowly. You love to see it
Idkkkkk, the Mach-E is kind of sexable üëÄ
Bid/ask spread is dogshit compared to SPY
Give me a reason why COIN earnings doesn‚Äôt follow HOOD
Tesla has a lot of upside in the future. I think its still under future value but thats just my opinion. Increasing coin position only strengthens with inflation
If you‚Äôve got at least three fingers I don‚Äôt see the problem
![img](emote|t5_2th52|5958) this looks like the marked down asparagus I got yesterday that I have already lost 5 pounds and a pint of blood in the toilet from
Bang
Let's freaking hope so, every 1% below -%1.4 is 1200 for me! That would equate to around $9,720 on a $2k put. 

I'm either drinking or drinking tonight. Only difference will be my mood! :D 

So early cheers to you good sir!
Because of the vote?
fuck changing the clocks ive been up since 330am and wont be able to stay up past 800pm after its dark for 4 hours

fuck this
IWM retard
I love SOFI
No one believed me when i was saying that LUV is the next big stock for the holidays
So your saying we shouldn‚Äôt have the freedom to kill ourselves?
IV was so high he might double his money
&gt; I don't have time to be bi. I'm straight and gay for money.
My crystal ball is cloudy, not sure what to play for the week. Biding my time until I see something I feel confident in.
Haha yeah. The earnings call will be the real signal not the report. Btw  check out BITQ etf that trades Coin Companies. Its trading under net value right now. So far im up 250% on options.
too late to load up on more industrial weekly calls at open? only copped fcx on friday thinking bill wouldn‚Äôt pass
Why define yourself as a bear or bull anyway instead of just trading the trend? That's like saying you're straight or gay while you can be bi and enjoy both.
I'm shorting down and going long up
Permabulls be like ‚Äúhow could anyone possibly have a bearish outlook in this market?‚Äù then sell everything the moment Elon puts out a dodgy tweet
I‚Äôm built different üòé
Tesla put guy def specing his lambo out right now
Would rather yolo my portfolio on 0 dt spy 420p than invest a dollar in boomer commie trash like FB or DIS
Way too poor for TSLA premiums. I feel like I'm getting left out of today's market funsies. ‡≤•‚ï≠‚ïÆ‡≤•

Earnings is tomorrow, I never usually hold past earnings but I like my odds with COIN
Sdc gonna tank. No one stuck at home staring at their teeth, new purchases prob dropped like a rock.
Everyone out and about looking at other people's teeth. No one buys SDC for the bitch across the table drinking a cocktail

*Edit* I fuckin told ya
Also CLF STLD X
Who‚Äôs ranium?
Could be but didn't see any smoke or anything outside once I looked. Not that my windows can see all the transformers nearby. It would make sense because there's super heavy frost outside like it looks like it snowed except it's just ice from condensation so I feel like an ice formation could have caused a short or something. Electrical stuff hates when the season changes
Uranium gang gang gang
Lol. No. It will drop about 9.5% today
SPY breaking ATH again by 10 AM

EOD price target $473-$475+
Annoying. I hate having to wait so long
Uranium stocks should get going this week.  URA 30 calls are probably free money
Ford gonna break 20 today and you fools will see why mustangs are the better muscle cars (not really) but Ford gonna break 20 today anyway
Luv $55 EOD
My CLF 23 calls 2 bagger on this gap looking for a quick move over $24
It was a Tesla call holder
TSLA at levels not seen since last week
You are confusing bulls with apes
Selling tesla before $1500 is like selling gold coins for $5
A slow burn is more dramatic
I‚Äôm just saying I think c rypto trading got really hot around end of the quarter for them. So may show some upside on this ER but I think next quarter will be a big jump up. 

Are we saying the same thing?
In your dreams
Fingers not dick you illiterate fuck
TSLA LEAPS actually going up in pre-market what the fuckkk? 

Also digital coin miners are fucking PRINTING!!!!

Questions like this help me understand why TSLA and NVDA are at their current prices

I voted for Bernie
I also assume you're retarded
Lmao. People are tilted af by this.
According to my TA there is a satan red candy cane anal plug candle on SPY daily, this can only mean one thing. ATH everyday this month.
It might blow your mind but it blew my gains.  They better have a cancer vax in the pipeline that increases your peen size and gives you 100 spy shares at the same time
Everyone thought that

TSLA  $1500C on cheap discount
Why only thing down big is tsla
Not happening. Remember how hard it was to make money on puts last pullback? This market takes the stairs down and the elevator up.

Yep, math checks out with profile pic
He always puts out tweets to act like he moved the market. But if you TA, this drop was coming anyway
"Oh TSLA is only down 6%" yeah elon musk hasn't sold a share yet lol
I wasn't the only one ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
That's because the only tall chick's looking at you have already been ran through by every mediocre Chad Thad and Brad in town
Home made silencer failed
Tesla was due for a pullback. Who thought Musk would be the one to initiate it?
Explain your wife‚Äôs vagina some more please
That is a very very bad idea.
Don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just going to sideways. $40 11/12 BLNK calls
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
Just give up already
&gt; I'm going to the moon.
Ummm, where are you going Tesla? Get back here above 1200.
!banbet TSLA -35% 1w
Do you really believe it was just because of a twitter poll?
You may get lucky I have been thinking about this as well. Since Coin will be putting earnings in when the coin was roughly around 40k and app downloads had dropped. However this may drop the price after hours before the actual earnings call when they will cover projections on where they currently are and while being number 1 on the app store they will be very positive. I just dont know if we get a chance to make good on the down before market opens.
COIN is a bluff lol puts at open
Imagine not knowing taxes and thinking that's really what he's doing
Did you just assume my gender
Oh Elon what is you doing, man?
These BLNK FDs going to print son!
I think my Gyna stocks might be saved for once.
I coulda been nuttin but sold a while ago... shoulda known cp would balk eventually
Fuck
Yeah, give us back our polio and our smallpox. My immune system was doing just fine fighting HIV without their help.

Talk to a doctor.
I think there‚Äôs a good probability COIN kills earnings. So many people getting into the coin trading space. They get fat fees and the spread on all the transactions. 

I just am not sure if it‚Äôs this quarter or next.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Depends what you buy. Im heavily in FB but I won‚Äôt touch anything else right now as the rest of FAANG, for example, is definitely overbought.
Water is actually not wet; It makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the state of a non-liquid when a liquid adheres to, and/or permeates its substance while maintaining chemically distinct structures. So if we say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the object.

I'm assuming it'll drop 5% at open. Then increase? What do you guys think?

You better sell them shits at open.

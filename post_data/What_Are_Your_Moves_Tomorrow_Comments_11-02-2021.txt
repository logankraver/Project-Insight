Obviously do what you want.. it was a joke. See last sentence dummy
i mean that's a very realistic risk of buying any gynese stock. that's why they're so cheap, they could turn worthless overnight.
No

Me - buys Chinese companies thinking their economy and potential is greater than USA given population metrics etc... Me - proceeds to watch companies I bought calls in drop 80% in a few months because the CCP decided to suddenly be the most bearish tanking fucks to ever live. Couldn't have timed it better.

My thesis that a Chinese internet streaming company had potential when it has a 10X bigger user base than twitch unfortunately lead to meeting the CCP head on in the biggest Chinese stock dump of the past 10 years. Thats the power I have.

The Rivian announcement. Ford owns a chunk of that company.

You really think buyers are going to step up?
First move I saw in theaters since covid and I liked it a lot. 8/10, laughed a decent amount, and it didn't take itself too seriously
I say this statement out loud at least 3 times per week
I’ll buy after this week tapir nonsense
Either, but why pay fees to sell out and rebuy. Plus you are exposed to market risk because you might sell out and go to rebuy the long call and it’s gone up. Easier to rebuy the short leg and you’re set.
We just gonna ignore the fact that some random analyst said TSLA could do 9 trillion in revenue lol
Link?

Guys I bought some Ford a while ago because I thought the CEO was endearing when he showed up on some dumb car show I like to accept a meaningless award. Now it’s 53 percent of my portfolios value and I have no idea what todo. I think I’m going to do nothing and just stare at it
&gt; I’m not sure I understand the question.
That’s generally the normal course of economic growth. Fuckstick.

Jesus, you still think they care about shorting it, hell they're probably in the group of hedge funds currently pumping it.
You could be waiting one month to all year for that magical -5% buy the dip price and in the meantime the prices rose another 30% while you waited.

Is there a proper way to exit out of the short leg of a spread?

If I want to exit the short leg on a debit spread and just ride the long call, I'd have to buy to close that short leg right?

Or I can just close out the spread in total and purchase a long leg separately?

GME hit $200 again for like the 69th time this year. This has been a flat ass price for gamestop and it feels like a war of attrition between bulls and the bear Melvin capital
So you're telling me Googl is a penny stock now?🤔
They use a tampon
Simple decision: long hold for ubiquitous implementation, or, dump now if you don't want to hold for a few years.

I don't currently hold positions, but I have before, and the company has a bright future.

Got back over $750 today. Gonna 10x it tomorrow and then do the same the next day
just buy a call in the am. if it goes south, which it has yet to do, simply—as quick as you can—sell for maybe a $100 loss. definitely worth the risk imo.

Lots of catalysts for Ford.

1. New Ranger out nov 24. Maverick was amazing, so expect ranger to be amazing too.
2. Ford has the battery capacity with SK innovation 
3. Mach E is better than model Y, according to most auto journalists 
4. Sync 4 is great
5. F150 prices rising a lot for 2022 model year
6. Maverick sold out, bronco sold out. F150 lightening sold out
7. Looks like the Biden tax credits will help Ford over Tesla 

Time to load up on Ford!
Accurate
Missed AFRM today but will prob pick up some calls in the morning.
If its vinegar or very acidic based marinade than really just 4-5 hours. If its im buttermilk or water brine or something like that, then overnight is fine but still not too long.

Why not? Bid and ask are only .01 apart

FAST FACTS - TSLA Tesla last year from nov2 to jan 8 went up 123%
Can someone give me advice on how best to deal with my 6 PLTR June 2022 30 calls? My thoughts are that it’s going to continue running up at least until earnings (11/9). I’m not sure whether or not I should peel off half prior to earnings, just after earnings or don’t sell any at all and continue to hold. The only reservation I have with holding through next year is the impending stock based compensation options that Alex Karp still has yet to execute that have to be executed prior to 12/3 which could very well depress the stock price by flooding the market with a bunch of shares. Any advice greatly appreciated!

right here bro 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
I dunno. I just saw that crazy $400 drop a little while ago in AH and assumed that's what it was.
You go Mr Hwang! I believe in you
I have to admit it and face facts, I like dudes more than women

It’s gonna have to top $20 for the sub to care, but I’m loaded on $18 11/19s.
Google, it dropped for like a minute

Dude.. I sold a $1200c that went in the money today for 4400, and I sold it for $1300. If you don’t care about losing money and you’re not a pussy like me then hodl.

What do you mean “down”? Last time I checked it was up substantially.
Thank God, I was worried there for a second.
Well done
Ford is officially an EV “play” now. Probably nothing. Do what you want.
12% stake in Rivian &amp; the electric F150 are obvious catalysts. Fuck boomers in general, but $F is a solid play.
"A bunch of people made money on TSLA calls and now its too late to get in without getting completely fucked"

If you paperhand your banbet it should be a permaban
You can just buy F now. They own a 12% stake in Rivian.
True. I know you didn't ask, but I always had a theory on 'ghosts', which helped me, especially as a kid, to not be scared.

Firstly, it's estimated that 100 billion humans have lived so far. If ghosts were real, there'd be an extreme case of over population and high population density, meaning they'd be everywhere, all the time. But they aren't, hence they're not real.

Secondly (the scientific one), it makes almost 0 sense physically for ghosts to exist, at least in the form society believes they could. Instead, with an advanced understanding of dimensions, I believe that 'ghost' experiences could be some form of life sort of glitching in and out of our 3D limited sensory existence.

Another wacky idea is parallel universes overlapping, creating glitches in reality which can be mistaken for ghosts.

Is Rivian worth buying at IPO launch?
I wouldn't tell him my locker combination from high school, which was in the 80s.

This is a great summation of how I feel, I haven’t played enough to get bored but I’ve heard similar things to what you wrote here. 

But no subscription fee so that’s fine with me, I don’t game as much as I used to, especially not MMOs, so I can’t imagine I’ll be starved for content.

If it is something built in already, it means that we have to see the price increase/decrease compared to the these days. Spy is up almost 5-6% up since then and you say taper is built in??

Because the real money can get loans below 1 percent, especially on real estate.  So even over paying for houses makes sense in an inflationary environment.  Inflation 10 percent, intrest 1 percent, and the underlieing asset appreciates in value. Win win.

So they buy up the supply,  and builders are smashed by rising material cost and lack of labor.
No drop here on TOS.

Retail was net seller today based on the data. There was also not a lot of positive sentiment so it's looks to be a Hedge Fund pump.

Are my tsla calls fucked be honest guys
🐽👃😳
It's good but nothing to do really. Game looks great and the systems are solid, so in the future it could be great, but for now there's not a long future ahead. That said, no subscription so def worth the money

What does everyone think about TSLAs AH movement?
I bought a second home in northern suburb of Atlanta last December. It was a brand new townhouse construction at $330K\~. Atlanta's been attracting tech companies like Microsoft and startups. And they buy properties in the suburbs for better schools and lower crime.

Well, couple of my neighbors bought it around the same time and flipped it for $460K in less than a year of ownership. Crazy times.

How many of you feel like IF/WHEN you decide to throw some money at the market it will be the catalyst for it to dump.. I've been on the sidelines waiting for a dip and now look.. I BET you when I decide to jump on the train the shit will drive off the tracks - you will have me to thank. My current positions are calls on Chinese stocks that have already lost 80% of their value in a few months.
DM was up 20% today, I doubled my position at the bottom a few weeks ago, and still down 40%. If there's a retest I would load up, but I think this thing is going to get sqozed.

Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

Will your banbet bot account for stock splits? ie if a current banbet is set for TSLA and it splits before that date does the banbet amount get adjusted at the time of the split?
I guess I live on the edge off the Chicago area and seen it happen alot and they have good prices

Oh no Cramer is a Tesla bull

Yeah because the Fed is printing. Once they stop that and raise interest rates this thing comes to an end and right quick. You've been in an era of insane Fed printing.

This is one long ass bubble if it is indeed a bubble and things will 'pop'... I've witnessed so many 'dips' rebound over the past few years that every time a new one happens I say surely this is the one that will be the start of a downtrend... Nope - shit rebounds straight back up to all time highs... Crazy times

Low interest rate. Lots of buyers who can finance. So demand is there.

Building material costs up. Labor cost up. Land price up. So cost is up.

Raise price. Demand met. Raise again. Demand met
How do I find out which bullshit company is gonna be +50% tomorrow? Surely there must be some method to catching these fuckers and buying their FDs.

What happened to Fisker today?
It only seems inevitable inside of the bubble. On the other side, it will be obviously delusional.
Hoping for some mooning, here with you but mine expires 11/5

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Due-Cryptographer (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 724.6983 when it was 792.02 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
SPY, QQQ IVs are so low
What do you think F will do tomorrow. I bought a bunch of in the money F calls Friday that expire the 19th up 75% already.
Gottem 🤭🤭
Why not both Lambo and food stamps? Seems like the fiscally responsible thing to do
It usually does, but sometimes it doesn't, but all its really doing is telling you what you already know by looking at the chart anyway.

"Oh look this stock went vertical 10 days a in a row now is probably not the best time to buy in for long term gains" = RSI @ 92
I have a feeling its going to happen soon, its like watching melting ice, pretty soon the bottom just gives way, feels that way right now. I just cannot see the price holding with no sales and poor delivery Saturday. My main view is that how on earth are they making 20,000 cars next year, they cannot get 600 out this year. This pig is ready for slaughter, just a matter of time till the BBQ.
Buy 2 weeks apart calls
Every day is the same. I get to 300pm and I just want to go to sleep and reset the day, hoping tomorrow will be better. It never is
There is absolutely a bubble, but that doesn't mean you should stay on the sidelines. Get while the gettings good, but don't get caught holding the bag.
I'm a millionaire if that happens.

Test*
I am honestly mind blown that both GME and AMC have held their share price gains... Happy for all the tards who are in profit but just continues to show me that valuations literally mean nothing. Stocks prices can stay retarded for a long long long time - maybe algorithms don't have a 'is this price fair value' input and instead trade these things purely on technical inputs rather than fundamentals of the business.

Is there a proper way to exit out of the short leg of a spread?

If I want to exit the short leg on a debit spread and just ride the long call, I'd have to buy to close that short leg right?

Or I can just close out the spread in total and purchase a long leg separately?

SPY puts too so.
Plug power seems like a good trade just like Tesla and GME :D
Will double down, if I didn't already have a position I'd be buying the shit out of it
Safely for 4%? WtF, dude! You can make 20% "safely" year over year.
That feeling when you pussied out on PLUG calls last week...
&gt; It's a bubble if the pop brings us down 50% from our highs.
The story of my life😕 immediately after triggering my stop loss it goes on to make all time highs while I watch from the side line…
My only issue is that I've pumped money into that I maybe should have put into my roof or my truck, both of which need replacing. I suspect it won't be an issue for much longer though. 😉
Winning. Me, in particular.

[deleted]
Damn, you held on so long too....
Is it a “bubble” if the pop just brings us down 20% from our highs which are still double the “normal” ?
Ah. Good move then congrats. Hoa is surely a bitch but for nice condos it’s generally worth it in my eyes if I were to have one anyway.
It’s either the lambo or food stamps
NO!

I’ve only been here since the summer and I’m sitting even so far due to being hesitant at times. Every time I’ve pulled, it ended up being the right decision but I have a few that I tried to hold onto, and now I have to hold onto them until I get my money back at the least lol

I wanna jump into Tesla but I know it’ll drop as soon as I do. 90% of my decisions don’t go that way but I know if I go into TSLA It would fuck it up for everyone. You’re welcome in advance.
I did too but its OK

Technically you start new on November 1st so you are still good
10-1 stock split?
A man of culture I see. Just bought some Ford calls today.
RKT was my biggest gain this year.  I bought a crapload of way OTM calls (35) the day before it memed in the spring.  Sold just below the top for a 1200% gain.
It never did.

Good luck fam. I’m rooting for ya. I’m debating between going all in and being conservative. I can only make another like 10k before I get kicked out of a program for my medication that gives it to me for free. I’d be paying like 1-3k a month until insurance kicks in if I’m not in it but the gains could be even better
Honesty I really get confused about calls and puts. I tried to learn on YouTube videos but just got more confused. I bought three shares around $650 and they’ve doubled so am happy.
The opposite of when you set stops, the price drops just low enough for them to be triggered and then bounces immediately
i plan on doing it again tomorrow

Ford calls if you like money. The run is just starting.
Holy shit holding over weekend too. Wow. You have the hands of a stone golem.
That is such a nice vehicle. Rental companies would not purchase those. Their vehicles get fucked by the clients. They smoke in them, destroy the interior, dents on the outside. They use cheaper cars that get you from point a to point b. Even the nice cars are still shit because they are treated so poorly.
For "only" $30k? Nah bro.

Of course it oscillates in a range like anything else, but by and large Tesla bears have been absolutely wrecked. Way better bearish plays out there without cult like followings. Even if you bought feb’s highs, you’d still have made a hefty profit this year.
I thought it was going to crash again and set buy orders around $800 that never got filled
BNGO, small cap growth rotation beginning. Was a 20+ bagger Dec-Jan last year. Looks primed to go back up the next few months. Buying 2022 calls
You’re welcome ;)
Lmaoooo I don't need to express dollar amounts to make money bro. I'm doing just fine without it but cool.
Can I get some advice on some calls?

Thought about buying calls on QuantumScape $QS today 

How high should I set the strike price
And how far should I go out?
Yeah that was supposed to be 1 2225 11/5c. Really bad misclick.
So Tesla to 1500 eow
I could only afford APPS and AMD calls but I guess i’m not complaining. One day i’ll be able to get a TSLA atm call of my own 🥺
This made my day 😂
Idk what to do. It’s NNN but I kind of feel like jerking off tonight. Saw this theory for “healthy masturbation” where you can jerk off as much as you want but only in the 24 hours following sex with your SO. I’m the guy who’s been jerking daily for months
Can we at least all agree that we may have broke the market?
You think IV is going to die? like the stock is just gonna be happy for no damn reason at 1220? Theta might ream them if they don't sell at a profit, but I assume the stock is going to do some crazy stuff for some time.
I sold the calls too early, and thought, man, wish I still had those.  So I took some of the profits and rolled into a smaller weekly call position at the end of the day.  We’ll see what tomm brings but based on AH, those should open up 100% tomm.  They were already up 25% in 10 minutes.

Moral of the story is one trade won’t make or break you.  Just place a better one.
What are the odds sofi goes up another 10% tomorrow on zero news.
poor chegg:( they the real ones for real, homies the only reason imma graduate college
lol yes it is

its just the inverse of the economy now

weak economy = more printing = strong markets

strong economy = no printing = weak markets
The metaverse is just a meme buzzword that companies have started using to trick boomers into buying their overvalued stock prove me wrong
there's no bubble, stay on the sidelines and watch us
Elon has more than all of us combined, so he’ll probably be last.
Chegg, next Roku. Puts puts puts.
Fuck that take that shit out and deal with the IRS in April
If you think world hunger can be fixed just by chucking money at it your crazy. Most funds won't even end up where they need to but straight into pockets. World hunger is a fundamental problem not a money one
rivn ipo is next week?  can anyone confirm?
Thots on Rivian next week? Might just me being salty about not wanting to fomo into Tesla, but anyhow, mind my tears.
Start by properly expressing dollar amounts, retard…

$87, not “87$”
This market makes me sick
I heard Papi Elon is in here giving out gold awards
Lyft crashed
Gonna be a while before bears come out. But yea things are looking rough going into 2022
Loan sharks
Ban they ugly asses yes

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
that's less than half a percent of tesla. why would that make any huge difference.
Pls
Chegg got shmurdered
If you bought in February, you didn’t break even until October.
not ominous at all
Holy crap. Tmrw gonna be wild
Yea because otm calls have higher risk therefore you get a higher interest percentage depending on what strike you choose. Now imagine of you put 10 contracts on a otm cheap premium call that's bank dude. Robinhood allows you to see your profit gain and lose before you even place the trade.
With SPG rocketing today along with everything else.... the big players are obvi calling bluff on taper.  So if we actually get taper on Wednesday, it's going to be a shitshow.
Outlook last earning hinted at issues with growth so they got hit hard. But then 3 weeks later they expanded.
Bag secured
What's a good buy in point for dwac? I was thinking like 27. No reason I like the number
"someone" lol

just say nancy pelosi
Even the market is a bear, very bullish indeed
IV crush will destroy them
Ban all of the fucking bears. Just ban them. They are always wrong. They deserve to be banned
Moooooooo!!!
Just buy and hold spy and you’ll do better
I wish that meant something.  This game is really a bunch of made up numbers and a few people trying to make a story fit to whatever the magic numbers tell them.
Whoops you got me
I think there is a separate page for gain porn.
Thats why I play both sides so I always come out on top
Ahahah idiot
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
I learned a good trading/life lesson today.  If something doesn’t work at all, immediately reverse course.  My Tesla puts opened down 45%.  I immediately reversed course and bought Tesla calls to hedge.  Sold the Tesla calls 3 hours later for 70% gain, waited for a slight dip, and unloaded the losing puts for a good fill at -35%.
As long as red blooded patriots buy calls and gamma the markets upwards literally no matter what, there is no end to growth
I believe you.
The job factory.
tesla puts are losing hardly any value... its insane... lol
Hmmm, well I know for a fact that they definitely are the gayest.
Rip
Same.
puts soon if mr daddy Elon is gonna sell 6b worth of Tesla
🤣🤣 my boy
Someone bought 1.2million in 2024 2225 TSLA LEAPS at 9am today
You're not that pal, guy!
Fuck yeah, fed my neighbor's sheep some scraps from my pot plant and she let me pet her
They fuckin themselves over?
No Nut November is cancelled.

Get ready for No Gain November.
Hhhahahahahaah
Where can I get more buying power?
Thank you papi Elon
Heard Hertz is ordering 100,000 $PTON bikes so obviously $PTON calls.
basically ALL conventional investment advice is fucking bullshit. just play options and make money, we need to stop this "invest safely at 4% per year" nonsense
Somewhere in the middle. I credit them knocking the bulk of the ape shit out of the daily but something something mods r 🌈 af
Not bear-curious, but yeah
Can confirm, I have 2000c
Wednesday feels red
As I see it, yes
Calls on wood.
Tapering is expected. So in that sense you could say it's priced in. 

But then you see LCID go up 50% when deliveries started, which was also 100% known ahead of time. 

So tapering is priced in for the non-retarded part of the market. Unfortunately the retards outnumber the non-retards atm.

But forreal. I suspect at the very least the level of optimism will wane a bit... no immediate crash.
Then you know how I feel holding a single TSLA put
My magic 8 ball says you're all fucked, theta wins

Any thoughts on Mind Medicine ?
Wow FCEL ripped up big today looks like $10 coming
Nice 0.7%!

Hes a fucking loser.
Fisker and Sofi let’s go!!!!!!!!!
Just knowing how fukt I will be tomororw with my 1090P. Least I only got one
Higher the PE ratio the better.
you think? they seem to be not doin too hot this year
The stock market isn't really related to the economy.
I feel gay for not having Tsla calls.

Nikolaaaaa
I bought puts and still made money on IV... the stock is that great.
You’ll thanks yourself when you’re 59-1/2
Last few times a cop has asked for my registration, I just tell him its on the back of the fucking car
When work says you have perfect attendance never taking a day of vacation, but the reality is you have a crippling market addiction
Sell the 1200c as soon as market opens, then wait about 3 hours to buy the 1300s.
I can’t touch it for 31 years tho
Cathie wood gives me wood
If only there was a way for option writers to price that into the contracts, you’ve found the loop hole!
Ford continues to 🚀AH. Dunno if the fact that they own 12% of Rivian is fully priced in yet.
Yeah if you can afford a few shares you can afford an OTM call that will make a lot more money in one day than three shares will make in years
[deleted]
No pussy is worth that torture. You're stronger than this king
I guess I’m not alone.  65% of us see the US economy in poor shape.   Bears coming out of hibernation?
just close your eyes and listen to the rocket sounds 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Who was the guy who bought 35k otm TSLA calls?  If he wasn’t a billionaire, he is now
So Elon cashed out $2.6bn right now. He should definitely donate that to Avis so they can also buy 100,000 Tesla's and then Tesla will rise another 25%. Literal infinite money glitch
#You're not that guy pal
All in on Rivian , and then all in on calls when options are open. Literally can't go tits up unless the market crashes then every stock would be fucked anyway.
I'm about to turn 87$ to 50k if I make the right tesla moves. So far so good. 1475 11/5 hitting different.
I’m so glad my work is shifting to a weekend schedule for a month. I’ll have monday and Tuesday off for all of November starting next week
I didn’t mean it as in tulips are worthless, but more along the lines of looking back in history TSLAs run is historic and might be the biggest runner of all time
Where is the post
Bro, they said "electric" with their vehicles. You big fuk
Good thing I’m fully invested in Tesla.com with maximum margin. What could possibly go wrong?
Bro thats so much money. Get that shit to your bankaccount. It feels like it doesnt exist because in fact it doesent exist until its right there on your bankaccounnt.
Rivian next week will look  juicy
Yesssss TSLA if we can reach a trillion why not 10 trillion
I didnt' sell early. Made money on it when it popped last week.  Then it crashed.  Now its back.  OCGN do what OCGN do.  Its been the same pattern I've seen going back to last Feb
its back 🚀🚀🚀
Its both a throwback from the day before ALPRs and a way to stop your vehicle if they want to search you for being black
Sell my 1200c 11/5 tomorrow morning when it sky rocket (if it does) and use that profit to get into 1300c 11/5 sounds like a good plan?
The more people say it the weirder it gets to me, I made money betting against TSLA and was wrong... Task failed successfully.
Apes strong together.
Lmao. Watch out for the ban on trading Gyna stocks.
at this point wayyyyy otm tsla 2000c gunna be printing out the ass like a piss missle, premiums to dummi for my poor college retard ass
Hopefully Elon will fix that for us.
VLTA is back AH 🚀🚀🚀
So they have something else to charge you for. They need to get their money some how. Same reason my town makes me pay for a vehicle sticker each year and a dog license. They can see I have a vehicle registered with the state to this address and if I don’t buy the sticker, they mail you a fine for the same amount and then another fine each month after
I had 5 Tesla shares at $850 and sold as soon as I broke even after holding for months and being in the negative 🤦🏻‍♂️
Almost all stocks are up today. What happened that’s making the economy boom?
So F puts were a bad idea today...
Nah, we been doing this for years now
hasnt she heard of Digornos?
Not gonna lie dawg, I've been eying long puts, ill wait for it to cross 1500 before I buy. Its a great firm and Papa Elon is a true wizard but Tesla just isn't worth every other auto manufacturer in the world market cap wise. Its been a humbling experience to anyone that tried to go short on it. As Steve Eisman put it, "Its very difficult to short a stock thats a cult."
Buddy, we can all see your comment and post history. I’d be insulting house cats
I feel bad that nobody ever told Zillow, "Don't get high on your own supply."
I wanna hear from that guy that yolo’d into Ford. Hit a 52w high today, hope you didn’t sell dude.
Sounds like your fault.
All the talk of Tesla calls in here makes me worry……
Dead
F just hit $18.05 in ah. Congrats to all call holders. I’ll no longer be selling cc’s
Have 30k worth of Tesla but it’s in my IRA. I’m pumped but it feels like it doesn’t even exist
That's Me lmaooo I did a 87$ 1475 call 11/5 and I'm still holding. I'm thinking about selling and going for a 1650 strike with more contracts to catch a 10 bagger if possible but make my expiring 11/19
*me down 35k today*

Gf: Let’s go out to dinner, your treat 🤡
nah thats crypto but enjoy the dog coin pump before the crash tesla actually has tech behind it its not useless tulips 🌷 but imaginary crypto coins yup
Random: why tf does my state make me put a sticker on my license plate each year when I renew my registration?
Cathie has morning Wood
Dude TSLA has been behaving the same way every day that it rips premarket. It goes up for a few mins then dips quickly before trending upwards again. Pay attention to the RSI. It's been pretty useful with Tesla lately
It fell -40% in a month after the last gamma squeeze, we had great success. you have the brain of a housecat
this is a good comment. try it out tomorrow bud let us know what’s good
Anyone got this link to this crazy Palantir image video?
I haven’t been positive since January when all the meme stocks took off it seems like everything has been downhill from there down around 11k and honestly not sure if I’ll ever make that money back :(
Went to the casino with $140 and left with 140.01
someone should tweet at elon asking if hes doing another stock split
My entire life has been inverted thanks to wsb. I hate the weekends and love the weekdays 🤡
I am grateful for your sacrifice, I bought a put, thinking this was so illogical, irony is, I'm up $50 due to volatility. Cant even lose money betting against it, its insane!
Tesla is in price exploration territory somewhere near the Andromeda Galaxy right now.
Fisker is looking really tasty. Called it earlier it’d be a play today. The stock is insanely undervalued compared to any other EVs.
Dude just admit you don’t know shit. 90% of this sub cries “it’s a bubble” for the past 6 months. 90% of this sub also loses money every day and is retarded. Which means it’s prob not a bubble
Yeah bc Tesla bears have had a ton of success over the last five years lol. You morons never learn
5 bagger at the 50 puts 😵‍💫
It was a joke.. hence the last sentence
Double entendre
bntx
Wtf are you smoking
my heart is telling me this shit ain’t stopping per this week at least
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)
I found the retard
Right. People buying tesla up here may never get their money back. The valuation for the company is insane.
Sometimes you gotta follow your heart
Oh the puts we will buy when TSLA rolls over. that first -5% day. 🥰
Need to free up some buying power for Rivian
Might fuck around and yolo even more into SKLZ
That's not a spoiler, it was in the first ten seconds of the trailer
After we sell
If he sold a bunch of his Tesla shares he could buy a whole lot of hot and spicy’s with that money just saying 🤷🏻‍♂️
A year ago I picked between a company that delivers nearly every product you can think of to America in 2 day shipping vs a company that sells fewer cars in a year than Toyota makes in under a month.

Guess which one I picked? 🤡🔫
Yeah, Bubbles...seen that dude on Tik Tok.
He also said on a tweet that he got funding to take Tesla private..
Like a hot n fast SPY.
Hopefully cum bubbles
Open a new account. Transfer your money. Keep playin.
This sub is gonna go off the deep end when people finally come to their senses and the bottom drops out of TSLA. I’m genuinely concerned
Chegg fuk
That’s on point bruh I’ve been pulling and praying for the last 7 years not a single problem. Straight gains.
Switch brokers
Lol no mention of SPG in here?
Same here, but I made enough last week to buy a calendar spread this morning right at the low point. Long 11/12 $1200 call and short 11/5 $1200 call. Cost me $1200 and I sold it for $2000 when it went ITM. Bought a new one last minute with a $1250 strike for $1900. My goal is to have the short call expire so I'm left with a long call purchased at a discount.
Today was so frustrating 👺
Have you tried picking better stocks
Lil UZI 🚀
Lmao stop it
As a $WISH bag holder - today was awesome. Instead of being down 99% , I’m down 97% 🤡
Oh don’t get me wrong, me too. I could be wrong! Could happen with the right catalyst.
Load up on these and wait for the splitttttt
Imagine the gains porn for chegg puts tomorrow
Do you think anyone will buy them when you sell them?
Gonna go blow some bubbles and pop them. BRB
d\[&gt;.&lt;\]b
That’s pure gambling bro. No advice can help you there.
Good earnings play is the one that not posted in WSB.
Wait until the last bull in the queue finds out he's the last one...
Oh RIP to your cholesterol levels as well

They got the top download slot over tik tok recently. Not sure that’ll be reflected in earnings this time though. But looks bullish af.
Bleh I got like $500 I wanna try to buy a Tesla call idk if I can even get one that cheap and be like a lot of you but I’m too much of a pussy, ugh lol &gt;.&lt;
ok ok so am i buying tsla calls tomorrow or am i crazy? does it ever stop?
The one that bought like 100k, I wanna see that guy.

"Surely it would be stupid to jump into TSLA calls now", I thought this morning.

Fuck it. I'm getting in tomorrow. I'll either get rich, or singlehandedly put a stop to this nonsense.
I don’t think your understanding HE SAID HE WOULD SELL TSLA STOCK TO FUND IT what aren’t I understanding here lmfao
I just took $50 to $800 the last month with zero Tesla. 

And that was just me screwing around. Plenty of ways to make money in a market like this.
And a part time job
just once again shouting into the void about how terrified/anxious I am for WISH earnings
Just college
I’d be happy with it
I had 20 XLY 205c for 1/22 that I sold a couple weeks ago for like a $1000 gain. Today they would have made me $12,000 thanks to TSLA. I suck at this.
dumb but you do you
Lol ev frenzy again. Rivian coming up next week.
I’m going to a wedding this weekend with all you can eat fried chicken and stuff. Rip to me not getting covid
When are we getting melon and snek etfs
That's how this thing ends though....thats how all bubbles collapse
**get r3kt**
&gt; I'm not sure. I think it's around $2
The upside has been amazing the down side will be rad too
What u think is the floor for $OTLY? I´m -30%

Thinking of selling csp’s on OCGN. Thoughts? Seems like a decent roi for that low of a capital investment
Infinite money cheat code, scarcity solved
Stock split
So now that I can’t buy and sell on the same day for 90 days, I’m thinking more long term. Perhaps LEAPS on AAPL, DNA, and shares in ROPE
party like its 1999 🤡🦍😍 🚀🚀🚀
They are about to make money though.... somehow
NoIdontthinkso , shib is a 70M x bagger , GL trying to top that , monster beverage stock is a 3000x bagger if you bought it at the lowest in 1987 , Tesla is just a 300x bagger if you bought it at the lowest , it have to hit 11T to be a 3000x bagger

Have a TSLA put with 1 single VLTA weekly call as a hedge

Can’t go tits up
Tesla is the greatest example of bulls paying bulls. Shorts don't even dare to touch the stock anymore and some have even taken their long hedge to the extreme. It's just bulls selling to the next bulls on a never ending cycle. "hey man wanna get richer? Take my shares and hold for a day" rinse and repeat
Show me some of your Tesla gains and shoot me your address so I can send my wife over
Today I learned about volatility. Bought a Tesla put (I do belong here) and the stock price soared. I looked at my put and it had gone from $5.05 to $6.45. Numbers are my least favorite of all the shapes, but my wife’s girlfriend spent a summer on Mykonos and helped me learn that other things contribute to a price of an option, not just the underlying stock.

Lmao wow cool tweet bro thanks for the generic info graphic that tells you nothing about growth rate. The 30% is literally from their earnings report. I know you probably struggle with reading which is why you stick to pictures on Twitter but you might want to actually look at the numbers. This stock is going much lower.
More than doubled here ✌️

What do you do for a living if I might ask
Hey this isn't a Pornhub search bar.
$ARRY likely to keep running up based on the earnings beat announced by $ENPH on 10/26.  Might keep running at least until $ARRY reports their earnings on Nov 11th.  $ARRY historical earnings are 1/2 of $ENPH at 1/10th the stock price.  Up 27% on last 4 days.   Been good so far.

Where the guy that had bought TSLA puts 😬
Congrats bro
How naive of you.

If GME somehow were to hit $1 million per share, there would still be those who held through, watching it plunge back to six, five, four, then three digits again only to then complain that they were “robbed” since it didn’t hit multiple millions.

And then the new tradition would continue.
\-.-
You buy that one and sell a $1200 Jan 19 2024 and make like $3k. Sure you’ll miss whatever gains above 1200 but a lot can happen between now and then. Plus at that point if they get called you will still realize the 120k gain instead of 85k now, and it’ll be long term cap gains.
Give everyone in Africa a share of TSLA to solve world hunger.
dwac to 20 then i jump in
Yessir I can’t agree more, I’ll get it while the getting is good but holy shit there will be many people who are fucked soon
He didn't sell he said he would if they could explain to him how they would solve world hunger with his 6b and they have to show receipts on how they use the money for the world to see.
Elon, please solve world hunger. Ber gotta eat too
This community has taught me that investing is a lot like unprotected sex. 

Getting in is the easy part, but pulling out at the right time can make the difference between a great time, or losing everything

Not as fkd as it will be when it tops 1500

VLTA what a pop AH
Might as well keep pumping then.
What about her boyfriend?
Yeah I mean I’m no master investor but this has been how I’ve made some good money lately. It just feels so weird from a numbers standpoint. Tesla gonna turn into Amazon in 5 years. It’ll be stuck hovering around 3k
Yes
We will see a big pullback for sure

Spy duh
I get to keep my money and hoe this time
shhhhh don't ruin my sub
That's similar to those losers who used to compare Amazon (which once had a 1000+ PE ratio) to the sum of most retail shops. It's now a meme, and this Tesla vs all other manufacturers will also similarly become a meme in 5~10 years.
Atleast you didn't do dwac. I hope
Not even what they did
when things are going so perfectly in youre life do you  ever feel like something bad has to happen? and vice versa?

It’s not this oversold brother.
Honestly that’s why I’m holding I’ve seen this before it could actually hit Tesla just has to be green like everyday this week
Piper perri fucked
**TSLA oversold imo**
Right, when the biggies dump it’s over for the rest of us
It’s crashing tomorrow now
It’s hilarious every time.
It’s oversold
Roku is now in a dispute with Amazon (Prime etc.). 

They’re also dealing with Google. 

Are the big boys waking up to the threat Roku might be posing in the streaming arena or just Roku pushing content providers?
So Elizabeth Holmes is like 37,000% guilty right?

What are we thinking on a verdict? A stern “that wasn’t very nice of you ma’am, please don’t do it again” is where my money is.
The market doesn’t make sense this is easy mode when you just buy calls not asking questions and make money you just gotta hop
On the train and follow everyone else when the ship
Tanks you make money on puts
you need to have a price for 1y -2y 3y etc otherwise you will never know when to add/trim
9 red days in a row for PYPL. Where my dead cat bounce at?
Enough to change your flair
Yeah that’s what I’m guessing. When the big wigs dump it’s over for the rest of us
For a guy with TSLA 1250 calls and GME 185 calls I made surprisingly little money today when I panic sold premium on a dip and then opened credit spreads against them later in the day.

I'm a biggggg FAT PUSSY.
You never know, it’s not like it’s tun so far has followed any sort of logic
Just do what I did and buy some outrageously OTM calls with funds you’re okay with losing.

bought 100 shares at 45.60..overreaction imo

Holding all my TSLA in there. Roth IRA for Americans.
I’m not a Tesla bear. Just doesn’t make sense man
They are projecting 30% growth for next year. I certainly hope they did more than 30% up until now cuz otherwise the valuation is just hilarious.
We’re all gonna forget Tesla started as a car company when they are ruling the world in 2035

Nothing. This is all options related and fomo with some shorts getting BTFO
Who knows
AMZN got pumped right to that 3311 support zone fucking bullshit

I’ve been saying “ this is ridiculous “ every day for the last month everytime I look at Tesla stock price 🤣
The price of a bears asshole as it gets shredded
Being a virgin gives you superpowers
YESLA ✅
Finally I timed one just right. Will hold on the assumption Biden will be backing up the money truck soon
Well to be fair I’m still under pdt rules with this account so I can’t go in and out of trades just yet. I’m building to that
If anyone wants an idea of what’s going on with Tesla this video sums it up pretty nicely. https://youtu.be/sYvMZ9JHx4c
Fuggin hope so
I mean she isn't a *star*, but your mom is always on Worldstar. Does that count?
stop, there's another EV that's way better, like a Tesla, or a shitty BMW i3
So it's pretty much certain that Tesla becomes the evil corporate overlords of the future at this point right?

Tesla weekly calls is the way. Finally built up the balls to hold one overnight.
Bezos is a 🤡 so….
Lol should have bought weekly calls. I’m up 225% on the ones I bought this morning.
Cult of Elon isn’t responsible for a $600 billion dollar influx the last few months, they’re helping but this is a pump exacerbated by short sellers
I had 1 share I bought with gains last week. Bought another one today when it wouldn’t stop going up
Tesla can’t keep going up man. The numbers don’t make sense. What the hell is being priced in at this point?
I’m honestly thinking $1350 end of week if pump continues.
🔌 too

The only one i don't have is net
25% day would be a litttttle ridiculous even by the standards of the current situation.
$BECKY

I bought some TSLA 1500c as a joke for about $650 each. They doubled today

Hertz. Price point movements by big whales. Split rumor.
Close but there are at least seven more people than your original number. Use Wikipedia or something and try again

1. The new spending bill will retains $12,500 EV credit for EVs built in US
2. More reports coming out with projections for EV adoption and EV sales increasing over the next 3-5 years
3. More and more car manufacturers coming out saying that they will either go full EV with their fleets or increase production significantly over next 5-10 years
4. Hertz might now buy 200k Model 3s
5. Tesla increasing sales and production in countries outside of US, especially in China and Europe
6. Elon Musk is god
They will once it costs that much for a loaf of bread
I got debt. not as bad as i thought
Fucked up my mouth with a abscessed tooth. Hella pain and inflammation.  I feel like im dying but i cant get to a dentist till Wednesday morning
Why he sell stock if he can just have a bank write him check..literally everyone who owns a business does this. Is this your first time investing ?
Imagine not having a TSLA to trade in. Fuck you SPYman.
They made an acquisition but damn are they overvalued (who isn't right now).  Hoping for a small correction in everything this week but who knows feels like we've all just been guessing for a while now.  Been waiting for the right time to get on the downside of TSLA too like many others but this market...
Where the CHEGG calls at?
So no 100500% jump in a day you’re saying…
https://ibb.co/Chq6ZvR

This shit hurts. Never sell shares.
On a scale from 1 to 10. Very fucked.
Same. Today I caved. Still looking good.
CHGG way oversold afterhours.  Guidance wasn't ideal but a nearly 30% drop is overkill imo
Hardly
I think they plugged their SATA ports into each other and played RuneScape to fuck.
Love r/thetagang.  That’s where most of my plays are

But I just made almost $50k today from Tesla alone.  What a drug. That would take me months of perfect plays with thetagang
Bears been saying this since $400 pre-split. Every earnings has seen PE decrease. Heavy growth mode and 2 new factories opening should just continue that trend...
Tsla 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 thank you god
What is wrong with TSLA. Why keeps going up against all odds from so-called analysts.
Elongated Muskrat never does any work
True. I think we’re in for some positive movement but I think it will be a flaccid nut. Been selling CCs on em because it’s been so lame. Wondering at what time I should stop that to save shares
Chegg u good bro?
Every day I hate you.
TSLA ENPH NET will never make any sense so just enjoy the ride
It’s not going too but if my $1450 calls hit by nov 5 I would lose my mind

That’s not even a support level. And this is exactly the type of company that gets completely destroyed by rising interest rates. Sky high valuation and rapidly shrinking growth rate. I’m just mad I didn’t find it sooner this is a gold mine for puts.
Tesla is the bubble. Not Rivian
God I hope. I’d jump in so fast
depending on your broker and account type, you should be able to roll in one transaction for a net credit

honestly I wouldn't sweat it either way
A combination of gamma squeezes (lots of open interest on OTM strikes) and people not selling no matter what because it's highly likely that a stock split will be announced. Not even tapering will break that. But ghey bers will never get it, which is why they'll always lose money and feast only during one month every year.

Looking at historicals we’re due for a nice jump.. vaccine eligibility for the target market of all their in person services is just the news we need
Yeah that was the original plan but it failed. Still holding 🥴
Do you think grimes does the work in bed or did Elon do all the hard work?
There’s always someone who gets butthurt when he says this.
Something called gamma
Yes
I bought three shares of TSLA, I have tiny gain porn. Tomorrow I will spend wishing I had bought a fuckton of it.
With some change maybe
So it's still undervalued. Got it

Any day it could dump HARD.
Bruh it’ll be there when you wake up. Just sell when you’re happy w your profits
Tesla stock is basically a UBI
Yes, and my wife is not happy about it most days.
Quick math says ford is more affordable per percent
around 1900 or 2k
Thought the same thing until I made 225% profit on my calls today. Ymmv
What's up with PROG?
Slowly fade back down towards 175? Game on!
Damn Elon sold 2.14m shares today worth $2.6bn goddamn what the fuck. My entire family tree for the next 1000 generations probably won't amount to $1 billion
This is how we know it is a bubble
Elon can buy America
F
People need to stop short TSLA because it will just keep going up lmao.
Lol  so “safer plays” aren’t considered gambling? 😂
Imagine not having a tfsa to trade in. Fuck you taxman
In the last 6 trading days Tesla has added roughly 300B market cap to its 900B high (900B to 1.2T).

This 300B market cap added in 6 days is more than the entire value of:

Toyota (249B)

Volkswagen (149B)

GM + Ford (80B + 71B)

Cisco (236B)

Intel (200B)

Adobe (almost) (304B)

almost 2x AMD (151B x2)
Anyone here still a virgin
Liquidate your 28 shares and buy to close the call? Then you could turn around and sell less risky CC’s.
PINS earnings got me so nervous. Lol please don’t dump
No tsla pls. Let me back in, I won’t teepee 🤚it again. Pls don’t leave me like this 😭. Ill do anything pls 😭
Bring it up next time you meet with whoever you report to. “Hey my probation period is almost up and I’d like to stick around, what do I need to do to make that happen?”
DIS actually just makes me mad
Elon is gonna hire bezos to be his shoe shine boy. Jeffrey is a fucking peasant
people keep FOMOing expecting it to crash to sub 1000 levels but it just keeps going higher on the “dip”
Buy ford or Amazon they own 5 and 20% respectively.
I just don’t believe in tesla, although I see what’s happening forcing shorts hands, it’s just too ludicrous of a market cap for me to ride up on, I’ll take my loss and learn my lesson about betting against euphoria. Just glad I sold the puts at 1168 or wherever can’t imagine holding until tomorrow
bytecorn
Elon has way more money than bezos. 125b more to be precise.
So I’m pre-fomoing in Meta before it RIPs
If TSLA crashes 50% tomorrow, it will still have a market cap of $600 billion....the same level at which it was being called an ultra bubble

# think about that
I’ve got like 600 bucks to dump. Is ocgn a good option? Lidar?

Fuck no
Yea
I'd be mad at missing out on Tesla, but they saved my account months ago when they had a similar rip up around 700s and gave me a first 10 bagger on only $500 to 5k. It was my last $500 too
Here is the thing, I believe COIN can grow 1000% and become a $500b company but I don't know how long it'll take. Might take 3 years or might take 15.
Every day I hate myself for not buying Tesla and every day I still resist the temptation to buy it

Yeah sounds great except I dont have the 35k+ require to close it
Because I’m sick and tired of not fomoing into to Tesla thinking it’ll drop 🤡
They’d have to do bezos first.
It’s oversold
Rivian isn’t a bubble. Just buy Tesla

If it doesnt crash, it hits that tomorrow

You’re probably near the top for that bracket, anyway, no debt at 30 is pretty rare.
you do a projection of future price at x time, and probable drop, if +1000% position gets below probable drop you never sell it, but you sell those new pos at +100% etc
100% lol

Stop taking that kind of risk. It worked out that’s good but it could’ve easily turned it into 10k. Less risk smaller gains over time are much better. Anyways what should I yolo on

Throwback to this article from last week, suggesting Elon “just sell nov 19 1500 covered calls” against his stock to cover potential unrealized capital gains taxes. The article is using this argument to convince people who don’t understand how stocks and derivatives work, that an unrealized capital gains tax is reasonable and feasible. It explains how Elon could sell covered calls to pay the tax bill, with only taking on risk for a few weeks 🤡🤡🤡
This shit is goint to 1500 boi
 if it hits 1m, which it will not, we would never here the end of it.  we may never here the end of it now.   Songs will song of the glory days  of January, yes it have been  almost 10 months,for years to come.

What's worse than being wrong and losing a bet is being right but losing the bet.  I agree with him and find it funny at the same time.
Yeah that’s what Tesla is you knob.

1400 is still only $500.  If it goes up again tomorrow will probably hit 8 or 900

I believe in you Mr Hwang!
This is actually a great spot to buy puts on TDOC thanks for the heads up. RSI just under 70 now should be hitting overbought right as it approaches the 200. Still trading at 12 P/S with tapering about to begin this should be an easy ride to double digits.
Could you explain? I feel like there's no way to salvage this lmao
Its after hours so they are all fucked but anything 1300c or higher are $9-5k a piece right now

Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

[deleted]
It was 184% before close. It’s more now but not sure how much more now. Been holding since Friday. I understand the temptation tho. If I were smart I would’ve sold but my IQ clearly isn’t high. That said I am optimistic for tomorrow ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
I would say: 

High conviction - people are willing to hold when they truly believe their investment thesis and that thesis says the price will keep climbing.

Betting what they are willing to lose - a lot easier to hold if that money isn’t earmarked for rent or food.

Scaling out: selling enough to cover initial and letting house money ride.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.investing.com/analysis/paypal-cautiously-optimistic-on-the-stock-ahead-of-earnings-200606945%3fampMode=1

-paypal is well established Fintech leader that I see a future for long term. They have the best established business model compared to competition like SQ, are less inflated, have been around longer and have a lower PE. And nothing about it's fundamentals have changed.
-PayPal is about 30% down from it's all time high making it a great entry point. 
-I believe PayPal is only currently down because of the news that was leaked about PINS acquisition and the only reason it hasn't reset is because earnings are being announced Nov 9th.
Remember two weeks ago when u/theghostofbillhwang thought he'd be cute and buy puts before it broke 1k?

Perfect credit, no SO. Realistically I COULD buy something but I would I have to take on more debt than I’d like and i’m also in an unstable part of my life rn meaning i’m not settled down rn and plan on job hopping frequently to max salary. I also don’t know where i’d like to move and buying something near me is out of the question because I hate it here. So i’m taking some time to build a DP enough to make a 15% on a multi family so if I do end up moving after a year it would be financially worth it to hire a manager

Roth don’t count as taxable income until you withdraw it. Otherwise you could do LEAPS and not realize gains for a long time. Ultimately you’ll be raising your income when you realize the gains (by withdrawing from Roth or otherwise).

Oh fuck. Everyone bail

Dude. Fuck. It’s so hard. I couldn’t. I have to sell at like 50% gain in hours. Just too juicy.

I feel like random success is the answer to that. It's one thing to think you got rich through you yourself being smart. It's another to realize you got rich by absolute luck, and realizing that enough to stop gambling...

But the stats of lotto winners and others obviously disproves that..

I'd be different though. ...

It hasn’t been real in a long while.  Hedge funds have made all the money they lost back selling people options and made a mint on top of it.  Find new memes or keep paying the assholes you think you all are hurting.
&gt; Delta is the derivative of an option price with respect to changes in the underlying share price. The delta value for a call option can be between 0 and 1, but it cannot equal zero or one. If you were to construct a portfolio consisting only of calls (with no puts), then your position would have positive exposure to upward moves in the stock's share price while having negative exposure on downward movements. In other words, if you buy options that are out-of-the money at strike prices above where shares are trading today, they will lose value as long as the market goes up from here; however when there is a decline in stocks their loss will be offset by gains made on winning bets elsewhere in your portfolio because these options still retain some intrinsic value even though they're not worth anything close to what you paid for them

I'm retarded so can someone explain why an ITM option can have a Delta less than 1? I don't understand why intrinsic value doesn't follow the share price?
I only hold one stock 

Guess which one 😉
Hell yeah I bought 100 11/5s at close
Can we get a wellness check on Burry though? Lol
addicted to money printer and easy fiscal policies. Expected that the feds will never fuck them. Super naive imo but track record says otherwise
Spacs and Tesla going crazy just like February of 2020, America is back.
Wowww shoulda bought CHGG puts. 

I work at a fucking large college and no one has mentioned that shit once this year. Probably should’ve connected those dots.
#[When you were one click away from buying TSLA at $650](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjYLY3BGDY4)
Do I need to shave my balls first before entering? I’m honestly not sure I have the necessary dexterity
Whatever makes you feel better you miserable fuck
I made a Ban Bet last week that TSLA would be 1200 by Tuesday. We are there, but I cannot understand anymore who is buying now. Above 1200 not even the most bullish analysts have a target.
Penis growth is directly correlated to the amount of money in your bank account
Imagine buying TSLA at 6000 per share lol
I sold my Tesla calls for a loss Friday 🤡
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
I'd buy McKenzie if I could, even if she were penniless. Way better than Jeff's new trash.
Tesla shorts
never stopping amd calls
My only regret is not buying more tesla, fuck me for trying to diversify
REEEEEE
Bet. Going to 290 before 310
Why would you buy garbage?
But but but Ryan Cohen

If BB breaks 12 and holds, it's game on folks.   Could this be the week?
😆
If someone wants to upgrade Tesla to $3000 a share, I'm fine with that
honestly may not have been a bad choice, NVDA is running for earnings just switch them over in the morning
Tesla at 900 alright time to sell. Tesla runs to 1000 okay I’m not buying. Tesla runs to 1100 okay game time. What the fuck lol. Why did I wait.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
I sold my 1400's for just 74% at 2.41. Closed at $4.98. Wish I held them longer ;(

Nah GME is only worth about 1/6th of Tesla
I don't know what happened to CHGG, but I just want to say they deserve it.
I’m a gay ber, but never a short Tesla gay ber

From TSLA calls very literally
Took a 90 day ban from my broker today paper handing some Tesla calls and about to take my first visualMod ban after yoloing on Amazon 🤡
Lol yes everything is fine in the market
I love it too, I'll take all the credit but I barely did anything, just came up with a paragraph of flavor text to tell a full size GPT3 model what to say. I tried to make him as American Psycho as possible.
Always thought it was the top and was hesitant to get in.  And when I did get in it was dumb weeklies that burned me.
I didn’t see any comparison between the two? Point me to a comment plz
No one knows shit
Just remembered it’s start of no shave November.. can’t wait to see who grows out the greatest bush on WSBs this year. Make sure to submit them to u/cashflow_ for official judging
Buy the falling knife! ^^🤡
So, why so many downvotes. Who mad?
The crash will be here as the Fed raises rates. Inflation isn’t going away
[deleted]
All these calls/puts will open at at least -40% tomorrow because of IV. You did the right thing.
The difference in wealth between Elon and Bezos is almost the same (give or take a few B) as between you and warren buffet…insane
elon is the richest person in the world and has over 50% more money than the second richest person 

jeff is poor basically
TSLA AH hopping like a crazy frog
Buy when they dip, like they do almost every day like 15-30 minutes after market opens
TSLA you’re scaring me.
Yes it is, will be announced Wednesday after FOMC meeting
It’s being formally announced this month. Starts next month.
Uh oh Tesla bears in here downvoting!
So many still trading at the bottom of year long corrections. Indexes might go flat for a bit but tons of good plays rn.
Bc bears fuk
You can tell us, it's OK.
***Per Benzenga***:

"Why is SoFI stock going up today?"

Answer: Lots of people talking about it on reddit.

Yeah it starts Wednesday

Big yikes dude good luck (but only after i sell my calls first pls)
Not gonna get much better for you
Tesla should just buy all the auto makers. Itd be like 20 percent of the market cap for everything
Shoulda let it ride but good for you!
&gt; I'm not a fan of the decentralization and I don't believe in anything that's not backed by tangible assets
Anyone have Chegg puts?
PALANTIR🤤🤤🤤
!banbet NET 175 4d
Its not happening.. it will go on as usual
Freaking Tesla unbelievable
If it makes you feel better I sold my Tesla shares at a 80% profit just before this run up. I stupidly put a stop loss in to "lock in my profits" got notified and then Tesla hit new highs the next day.
Just need fomc to tank SPY 1 - 1.5%, then I can switch back to calls.
Why tho? If you’ve been watching closely you should have seen this coming
A nice clean $1400
Already see the impact. Don’t gotta wait
Is tapering starting this month?   


because I don’t want to be caught in the mother of all bull traps lol
I did the same for AAPL and AMZN earnings last week. It wasnt too late for me, maybe not too late for you
SpaceX can beat gravity…. Not Tesla…. Just hope I’m around to see it
I would kill myself. Just get out before its too late.
Sold my tesla 1300’s for 200% at close
If Elon doesn't send Burry a pair of shorty shorts I'll be highly disappointed
Standard Lithium.
Serious question - why shouldn’t everyone place 2023 put options on the equity markets biggest ETFs given all the speculation around an impending major stock market correction.
Been saying that for 2 years. Don’t buy calls, no way it keeps going up. But don’t buy puts, because it never goes down either.
Worldwide hunger is a fundamental problem not a money problem. I'm not worried
 Tesla split?
Tesla is an absolute fucking monster wtf lol
Still good
Choice
Tesla stock for president
When every single person buys calls…
Tesla up nearly 60% in a month 🤯
😆
Dec 17
We still got 7-8 years till the big one 🎉
Lmfao solid advice
I think SpaceX could too. And that might be the only thing that would get me to sell my TSLA shares. I don't think Tesla will die though.
[deleted]
That's very true. I think we're already starting to see that.
Which clone?
Michael Buried
Which is great because the 2008 financial crisis actually delayed boomers retiring and jammed up the labor market the other direction

why did i paperhand those tesla calls i bought earlier :( god damn it
"While meme stocks have soared on the back of retail trader chatter and individuals pumping up their bets on social media, Monday’s rally looks to have the fingerprints of Wall Street pros, according to trading data on Fidelity’s platform. None of the original meme stocks were among the 10 most bought on the platform, with sales of both GameStop and SofFi overshadowing buy orders."

GME isn't even real, just hedge funds pumping to get retail to hold the bag.
Sofi $25 by 10 am
Well 12% run up with no news would indeed look bullish my guy lmao. I am waiting for the damn bank charter for 25-30 but hoping they don’t delay until after earnings or miss earnings badly and ignore the charter altogether
Does Bezos work for Musk now?
Turns out you may be brilliant
It's a way to hold these shills accountable. If they want to post unrealistic, short-term price targets then make a ban bet.

u/zjz , I’m sure you already know this, but great fucking job with visualmod I can’t get over some of his replies
I wonder if that AAPL/Jelqing enthusiast is still around? Probably hanging out with the Gourd Guy.
Good point but it's not just the labor shortage that's going to accelerate.  It's the movement of money as well from volatile growth investments to life annuities, bonds, etc.
Lol yeah just dont buy a put or sumthin
alright now the fomo is strong, buying tsla calls tomorrow
Erase the monkey shit and yeah
There are people interested in keeping this bull run going. They'll do anything to keep it going
Musk can now buy all 4 major professional sports in the USA (260 Billion), and Bezos ex (55 Billion).

I know that feeling. Placed a limit buy around 2pm that never got filled. Now those calls are up probably 100% by now AH.
same here, was thinking about it since todays open but didn't pull the trigger
Once you see a pattern forming, the pattern changes
HAHAHAHAH BURRY YOU MISERABLE FUCK
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Wednesday, I believe the silence period ends.
Tesla and Gme. I don’t know what to say, and no it won’t last forever, but god damn! Tomorrow is gonna be EPIC
I’m glad to see people making gains but can you guys stop saying you’re 16-22 years old in the title? I’m an old asshole and it makes me feel bad. 🙏
I’d like to see what that looks like
Yup 11/5. Didn’t even think they’d actually print
SOFI so good.
None of which I own.
1400c was $175 at 2pm. If you can't afford that I dunno lol. It hit $700 before close
Im a fucking clown: 

Paper handed my TSLA call and had AMZN and Googl calls 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡

F M L🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
TSLA is making it very hard to be a good boy 🥺
Yeah. Don’t buy. Thanks
Oh shi
This. I own TSLA in my retirement account but in my play account I would have to sell half my shit just to buy 1 TSLA call
Tesla will only go up
Bros got $$$ he'll be fine
Fucking hell guys I shorted Tesla at 775 like 2 months ago and I’m still fucking waiting to cover it, I thought last week was painful
They’re so delusional. They think it’s worth the same lol!
What happened to their online tutors?
one time wsb favorite CHGG collapses 🔻🔻🔻
i'm fucking retarded, meant to buy baba calls at close, not nvda :(
The taper isn’t priced in. Nothing is priced in with this market.
Well props to him for sticking with the trading plan.
He should pay his taxes
yea link in my comment above
&gt;where will advertisers go

to the metaverse
Just do it and don’t think about it. It’s just a video game anyway.
Otm kiddo
Outrageous yolos.

I got 2 tesla 1500c for 112 last friday.
or poor
TSLA feeling like one of those times where I don’t buy calls because it “ran too much” then it keeps going higher. Then the minute I decide to buy it’ll drop 200 points non stop.
What hurts more. Being wrong, or watching everyone else celebrate?
I will at $30
I like the few I follow on Twitter. If I watched their YouTube stuff, I'd miss out on trades. Here are the ones who've made me money:

OptionsMike

Maximus\_Holla

ZeContrarian7

sentimentrader

DcrCharts

AmandaCStocks

I'm sure more than one of them is just into pumping and dumping, but if you get early and set a good stop loss (that you move up as the stock moves up), you should make money (as I have).
Yes
🤣🤣
forgive my ignorance, but who wrote the bill? I assume all of congress is in bed with UAW due to those being "good, american jobs".
You didn’t lock anything yet.

How’s your Tesla puts ?
!RemindMe 8days buy Celsius calls
It's ok pussy
Same lmfao
He’s looking for his next job. He’s out in February and is going to Citadel or Blackrock
Why the run up??
I’m glad I used my Roth for Tesla 🤧
weeklies?
Manchin is too busy getting off by straddling the fence like a cowgirl.
Oh shit I sold my $1300 call thinking it was gonna go down n it keeps going up wtf -.-
Lmao opened a tesla call spread and it already printed hard
At what age does your penis stop growing? I am 34, is there still hope I will hit 5 inches (currently 4.3 inches)?
Twlo is breaking out. Jump on.
With earlier Tesla calls 😁
Hm do they cost?
Lol up 225% on 1300c’s I bought this morning as of close. Thanks, papa.
Someone someday is going to get really rich with weekly Tesla puts
Who you trying to be? Michael Beary?
Surprised he didn’t get margin called
This shit low key scary, so many stocks up 30-40% up since last month.
Weird day for stonks
Ride the wave fellow tard!
Seeing the markets run like this with FOMC tomorrow is weird.
TA says 1250

AI says 1450
Simultaneously being TSLA gang and THETA gang cus i locked in some profits by selling some high ass weeklies 👀
Kinda nervous about taper starting this month... or is that priced in now?
Bezos still butthurt about the copy cat thing. Won't do it outa stubborness
Did anyone buy lcid calls??
lol, my playbook the last 4 trading days.
Just split amzn and let me in. TF ?
Wait for this same annoying post!!
since mid Feb. I bought at the top of after the GME saga. Cut my losses around -45% for most of these
I placed some TSLA 1300 calls when it was down at 1160 around $16.50 per contract. Turns out they never filled and are now up almost 90% at like $29. Feels badman.
weed stocks? petition to legalize in italy 🇮🇹 luxenburg already legalized germany soon? looks like eurotrash beat us on maryjane👊
Lmao at this site (simply wall st)that said CHGG was undervalued this morning
by 20%
This is the second week in a row I’ve bought Tesla calls and sold them for a good return, checked back a few hours later and would have had a multi bagger.  

Feels good to be green but god damn.
how do you losers afford TSLA calls?
Elon net worth is so far above Jeff now
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
Been watching TSLA for 2 years and made zero on it.

Imagine that.
Price movement is more dependent upon the buy/sell ratio of shares than quantity alone
The key to investing in Tesla is to ignore the first 2 numbers in the price. When the second 2 numbers are low, I buy. Then I sell when they're high. When they're low again, I buy. Not financial advice
wait the nazis lost the war? we did it fellow time travelers! the present is no longer a nazi-ruled world! i can’t believe all it took was go the past and sway the american government from making peace with the nazis, whodathunk it
if pltr gets even close to $30, puts are 110% the move
Sold my tesla 11/5 1130 calls at close for 250% profit. You'd think I'd be happy but all I can think about is tesla up $15 after hours.
!banbet UPST 400 1w
Nah chegg benefited from online classes and the ability to use chegg. Now as classes are going back to physical, it’ll be bad for em
About 10,000 baby boomers have been retiring every day since 2016. This labor shortage was inevitable.
I'm bearish but I know J Pow won't surprise us with anything this week. They always reiterate that as being a goal of the Fed. Alternatively, he may be sitting at work watching TSLA wondering what the fuck he's done.
&gt; Yes, but they don’t understand what it means.
I'm sure the Fed's liquidity has helped the market but $180B a month isn't even all that much.  TSLA is just 1 ticker but it traded $50B volume just today. Interest rates may debt the market but taper shouldn't.
When's the TSLA share offering....?

bruh got 100% return on a 1400 call lol
Because after the 100k order they did another 100k (full price) and it could lead to more deals with more companies
Sold a $1300 call market close and TSLA alrdy at 1225.  What the shit.
Honestly, I'm okay with a complete meltdown.  I'm not rich as it is.  Every night I wish I had a time machine to go back and buy everything at the covid bottom so I could have spent the next year jackin off and not going to work, but here we are.

Theta creeping up on me…
Honestly if they come out and say that they've perfected FSD, lowered the cost of solar roofs to be the same as normal roofs, have tons of contracts of boring tunnels all over the god damn place and also somehow perfected solid state batteries, then yeah $10t in 5 years if they somehow did all that shit.

20k in gains by Friday EOD or ban
Gme had over double its daily average volume. Just because it wasn't one of the top 10 most traded on whatever platform dosnt mean its not showing signs of being bullish. Not to mention share price is a huge variable when comparing volume.
I agree but I stopped fighting the trend today and it’s paying.
If you like to ride on rollercoasters you will like MP.
True, but not 100%. He said he’d sell shares, not the whole company
&gt; Tesla is a company that makes cars.
AT&amp;T. Their ticker is the first one that pops up when ppl try to buy TSLA stock. Must be eliminated 😊
Lol there is still juice left in this thing. 60% more at least.
[deleted]
Spacex can. Tesla will die by legacy automakers.
Damn Chegg has just been continually getting killed the past 6 months. Did that lawsuit really screw them that bad? I think as society returns back to normal Chegg will start rising again
That TSLA short bro can now short even more as per his plan!
Thanks to everyone who talked me into getting that 1300 TSLA call up 297%. Tomorrow will be one for the books
How is hertz buying cars not already built into the price? Wasn't that why TSLA had a high valuation anyway? Wasn't this entirely expected based on price. If this wasn't expected then why was it so expensive to start?  

I know meme magic but this is comical. 

Congrats autists, I missed this one.
I recommend you file for bankruptcy today and start over with new YOLOs tomorrow
Well, they’re gonna have to go back to work I guess. Someone has to clean our lambos. That shit ain’t cleaning itself

Burry only. Sorry.
Everyone is talking about the Great Resignation like it's a Millennial only thing.

Actually the Pandemic greatly accelerated Baby Boomer retirement.  The youngest boomers are 57 to the oldest around 77.  The median is 66.

In other words this is the PEAK exodus period of boomers pulling out of work, switching their retirement accounts from growth to fixed income and safe haven investments.

Think about the impact of this in the coming year.

Edit: note there is also a gap between the population explosion of the boomers and Gen X until normal age distributions began to resume.
Up 300% on my 2000cs purchased this morning for $4 a piece. This is madness
It was here today.  But it may not be there tomorrow.
TSLA exuberance really going to be the catalyst
BP 👀
Doesn’t look like it.
I saw that.  For the last 1.5 years it seems most moves in SPG are risk off, it pops when everything drops.  Slides when the rest of the market is hot.  Either something's different today or we're taking the elevator down this week.
🤔
Pelosi might be the richest woman on Earth if she holds onto her Tesla leaps lmao
Calls or wait it out. I lost $4,000 today thinking I could fight euphoria.
So my ARKW is finally in the positive territory after about a year of drilling.   
Should I keep holding it or dump it and move on?
AMZN split…when?
TSLA $1221 after hours… 🤯🤯🤯
Only way TSLA falls is if Elon dies. He can even go autistic retardations and it’ll still go up

Dang I forgot to get puts.
Any big money short also had way out of the money calls as a hedge so they're probably up or even overall with the added benefit of raising their short cost basis.

Did you buy the Tesla Jan 1500c I sold?
Of 2030
Sell TSLA at market open then buy back after post-opening dip. Shit’s basically a printer
Jesus Christ its almost up to $1225 and it's not even an hour into AH
No idea about this Brandon shit and too tired to care. Sounds lame.
They will, he's not the only one who maths....
Only 7k? You’re no 009, that’s for sure.
I don't know, but it is nice to see it keep moving AH
Oh man, you are gutsy
Most likely. But they are ATM so if it has even a small correction I’m good.
Who else rubbing their nipples rn?
I also almost bought calls. Screenshot the one I wanted to by 3 of. Went from $2500 to $4500. Meanwhile the actual move I made.. AMZN calls turned from 2500-1900 :)
&gt; tsla not stopping ~~until 2,000~~
That's how I feel.
Wish I had the balls to go 10k+ balls deep in weeklies like some do
Tsla calls…. Always tsla calls
&gt; The companies that make cars and sell them are car makers.
I really can’t see how there is any other play tomm than Tesla calls.  Yeah this won’t last forever but it is here now.  Take it.
Manchin, I’ll palm you off if you just let infrastructure bill pass, just come by and it’s yours.
It'll drop like always dingus
Any youtube stock channels you guys recommend? Or are they all retarded bullshit? Ben Felix is the only guy I've found that isn't just shit-pumping and hyperbole.
that is why you will never get rich. That is a truly retarded move. Don't sell your winners to chase things that have already found their fair value
The companies that make cars and sell them?
Omg...wtf
!banbet TSLA 1100 11/15/2021
I’m torn between TSLA calls and TSLA calls
I think it opens green but probably doesn't stay green. but if somehow tomorrow tsla closes green again I think there's a good chance we see &gt;1400 eow
There’s literally momentum on it and retards like you are still trying to short it. How many bears have to die until all the later retards understand not to short Tesla?
[deleted]
Lol.  Good, good, use your regardedness bot, let the dumbass flow through you
Sounds like hell is coming
Because I’m a tard and wanted to see what happens
Up 5k on CHPT don't wanna rug pull before 28
My move is basically hope bezos is jealous of Elon solving world hunger so he announces a stock split tonight and sends shares sky high for my weeklies to print
When making a million dollars in one day, is just no fun anymore.

Nah chief being greedy always leads to losses. You did good.
I forgot what green looked like!

The rest of this week is really gonna hurt, huh?

tsla not stopping until 2,000

win or lose, CHEGG is a cute name for a company
Half of the people currently holding calls will hold them till a big drop and end up red. Never bad to lock in profit. Next time consider scaling out incrementally.
you were never worried that the bot did 1 month instead of 2; right?
I’m equally torn between buying TSLA calls and TSLA puts
Sold mine one of my Tesla 1180C weeklies at closing today. Still got two more, but I definitely understand dude
To make it big in life, you really do have to just be a risk taker and get lucky to a large extent don't you.   At times, there's not really much of a difference between the person made it big, and the one who got bankrupt. Hell, sometimes those 2 are the same person

Looking at AMC performance today, earnings coming and the increase of shills I’m all in.
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/jsie-iaiqhsi816278 (3/5) made a bet that BOIL would go to 70.0 when it was 66.55 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
I could’ve made a bunch of money from TSLA today but I’m a pussy
Oh wow what a day. my chegg puts expired worthless 9 months ago
why PLTR doing TSLA things?
Elon has helped me make money, giving me more “stimmies” than the government this year. Between pumping Doge, GME, and now TSLA. He’s a cool guy but he should pay his taxes just a tad. 👍
I got sofi at 14/ share. Currently selling my sofi to put it into paypal
yeah they call me 007

0 jobs

0 degrees

7k debt
Go ahead and gloat. You've earned it, motherfucker. You buy calls, too, stud?
Because you bought it and it went up
If Tesla becomes a $10Trillion company I'm a millionaire. You think it'd ever get that high? Seems like it could in 5 years.
https://ibb.co/55cPd69

Dems please pass the bills so I can move out of my parents house, thank you
I bought TSLA in May at 580 and sold before earnings to lock in 50% profit... F
Bezos would get the same love as Elon if he just split his damn stock.
Of Course. We have to call him because he has to open a new one !
No, talking just buying stock for himself. Majority of his assets are TSLA stock already. Add to that pile while increasing demand for TSLA stock, maintaining the FOMO. Makes his holdings worth more, allowing him to buy more.
What competitors lmao
Soooo, MQ is making money hand over fist bc of their affiliations. How can it be 25% shorted? Is the reason it goes up 5-10% intraday every day the shorts covering in an orderly fashion? BC if that's the case we should FUCK THEM UP
Work of art.
My plan is buy calls, sell that afternoon or next day for 30-100% gain.  Keep doing this until it fails.  Even if the failure go to -70%, I’ll have profited overall on the strategy
PLTR you piece of fucking shit you can do better than that
Nextdoor to debut via Spac on Thursday - are we sleeping on this? APE ARMY MEETS KAREN ARMY?
Put it all on TSLA
Laughing or crying?
2k with the current momentum, though bit of a pipe dream imho
You ok NVDA?
Real question, why doesn’t TSLA  buy out its competitors?
So far I haven’t nutted
No one knows. No one’s ever held through a split…. And lived
I got 15k of puts that hope you’re right.
Manchin trying to save his SPY puts obviously
SpaceX taking $ASTS to launch. Don’t sleep
How tf am I up 40% on tsla?!
its confirmed that TSLA has cured cancer, ended world hunger, and fucked your puts
Oh oh, guess mine next. 40, no college degree, usmc veteran. Go!
Fomc.  News cycle restart towards FUD.  Sector rotation for holiday season.  Just hit ATH for what 59th time.  Big Earnings past (and not super great other than Tsla and Msft). Just need the fed to open mouth about interest rate raises and it will be a bloody red afternoon.
Gentlemen. I just want to say it’s been an absolute pleasure making and losing money with you over the last year. It doesn’t matter if you made or lost fortunes, we did it right, we “did good”. Financial markets, as we once knew them, will never be the same.
EVGO. Once again.
and Still nobody cares
Newton once said: two things are for certain, gravity and the fact that bears are idiots.
Stop being a bitch
Everyone's talking about Tesla, meanwhile I'd sell my house and car to out it into PayPal right now.
Just want to make sure the hedge funds don't get away with their manipulation
There's 7 billion people. That means it's $42,000,000 per person.
I'm holding for 28
I dont doubt their ability to show profit growth. I would like to see their cost breakdowns to see how they hit that margin target..  I doubt the ability to maintain 30% margins if the other automakers are much lower.  I also doubt they will ever sell enough to hit their absurd valuation.
Elon said hed sell Tesla and give 6 billion if the UN could explain how the money would solve world hunger. Lmao. Power play alpha move
Either back to 25 this week or up to 50. I sold at 40 today and Friday. So want to buy dec calls but the pricing is fucked
To not nut
Some CHGG Put billionaires tomorrow
Would it make sense to buy a put, thus confusing the trading gods about which way to fuck me?
december 2020:

hooray jpow saved the economy! everyone who said he was a dumbass and that money printing would bite him in the ass was called a moron

november 2021:

financial markets full on casino

stock market bubble that made buying the peak of the 2000 bubble look like it was a value play

shitcon bubble making 2017 look like a bitch

housing market making the 2008 bubble look like a bitch

1980s levels of inflation, causing workers to quit jobs en masse (5% is a load of shit, they have changed the calculations used since then, if we use 1980s calculation we are near the same levels)

0% interest rates and 120 bil a month QE, central bankers terrified of popping the "everything bubble" because just 1 of the many bubbles popping has wiped out the economy in the past, having 5 larger ones pop at once is going to be fun
[deleted]
I am with you but I am going to keep buying. The upside potential is greater for EVGO compared to the rest thought purely for the fact that entry price is lower. Once this bill is passed, they are all going to rise in sync but one will surpass all do them. Tesla will do the same - my guess is that Tesla hits $1500 or so and a stock split option comes up..
You made money so it was the right decision. There's always tomorrow.
Just don’t fucking dance
Sold my 1010c 12/17 for $8k, at close today it’s $23.5k 😢
Epic win.
ChaChing on my CHGG puts. It's been ages since I got one so strongly.
‘Am I a joke to you?’ -TSLA
LFG
2.5%


When r earnings?
That's not a take off. Its hardly at todays high
"While meme stocks have soared on the back of retail trader chatter and individuals pumping up their bets on social media, Monday’s rally looks to have the fingerprints of Wall Street pros, according to trading data on Fidelity’s platform. None of the original meme stocks were among the 10 most bought on the platform, with sales of both GameStop and SofFi overshadowing buy orders."

Hedge fund puppet
Each day that passes I wish I had bought more calls the day before
Market about to close "oh boy now i dont have to watch tickers i can have fun"

Markets closed *obsesses over whether to double down or take profits and run*
4th time posting this in under ten mins. You ok? Want a soda pop?
GME $220 -&gt; OCGN $20 11/12 calls -&gt; retire
This guy maths /s
Cry
U usually get fucked but not in a good way
i  dont feel well. too much jealousy and seething is doing a number on my heart and testicles
Thanks. Can I have gigabrain as my flair?
If you're going to go all caps, use #
I'm also a retard and bought two more 11/12 $55c for $80 last Monday. Those are now worth $34.
UZI lmaooo
NEWS FLASH....IF THE PRICE OF OIL KEEPS.GOING UP....CRASH
Eow the way things are looking
Gets split the same amount of the stocks, you'd have 4 contracts instead of 1 with a 1 4 split
Please come true
Na that’s like 1 billion each and he’ll still have 233 billion left. I did the math 🤓🤓🤓
SPG mooning. Down with bezos up with mallrats
No shot Tesla is green tomorrow
Shout out to AMD
Got me through college though...
My favorite stonk is BBreaking out!
Need Elon to announce reverse stock split to $10,000/share. Save my puts.
I know crazy money!
Sadly I sold my TSLA 1200 calls just before close. But I bought chegg puts with the profits so I guess that makes up for it.
You know this because it’s true for you too
Elon is making the other centibillionaires look like peasants 😂
😂😂😂
As much as it hurts me to take profit on my TSLA 1200c which was ITM I felt like it was the right play. This didn't age well though. Still going up AH
CHPT scary good price here
going to therapy this afternoon and I'm pretty sure he's gonna ask me the same thing
911 with tsla gains
A buyback would be retarded, but still drive up price.
David Beasley, is that you?
My AMD 130 eow banbet may come true 👀
Wait til the market figures out about a taper. Nothing is ever priced in
You are a ninny and a nicompoop sir
Bear gang rise up
Tesla is gonna make all of us have a collective nut tomorrow
Shitadel covered at SDC today. Have inside info
vlta quietly taking off!
Dude I eat actual
Crayons 🖍 lol 😂
I’m convinced all these big money Tesla shorts are secretly long and just trying to trick the average joe into thinking they’re beating “the man”
I bought 11/5 1400 like 15 minutes to close and they are up 30%
🤦
Overreaction maybe, might try and ride it back

&gt; The answer to this question is a bit more complicated than most. First, you need to know that DKNG 11/19 $65c expires on December 19th of 2018 and has an implied volatility of roughly 50%. If the underlying stock does not move by then, your option will expire worthless. However if it moves significantly in either direction before expiration date, you could see some significant gains or losses depending on which way the stock goes. To figure out how much money you can make from selling your call option early (before its expiration), we first must calculate what I like to call "Theta". Theta represents how much time value there is left in any given position after subtracting all other factors such as intrinsic value and extrinsic value (time decay). In our case:
Banking money is never a losing decision
Even if it goes higher, you did the right thing. RSI is at 95, like it’s a time bomb
Ofcourse not. he sometimes uses his clones.
After getting ass fucked by $MVIS last week, today it gave me a little reach around.
I bought a DKNG 11/19 $65c back in early Septembear before it took a 25% dive! The option cost me $475 and is now worth $10 lol. What do I do?
When fb gets hit with mother of all regulations, where will advertisers go? 

$snap $roku $googl $ttd
TSLA really gonna hit 1500 by eoy isn't it
.52% of a million is $5200
Don't you love how these cock suckers will pay each other over 460 a share before and after hours but they ain't paying us all fucking day .. kicking the can down the road .. get me paid bitch
Real talk, Elon has an infinite money glitch at this point.

Could just buy TSLA stock, increasing his holdings, driving up price, increasing his net, allowing him to buy more stock.

![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
Damn CHEGG
I made over 4% today.
Growth for the quarter is trash. Its the start of new school year, should be 50% YoY. Stock is (was) valued for growth, not fundamentals.
Only if you believe
My coworkers think I’m retarded because I was up 5k eod on Tesla calls but didn’t sell before close
wow so surprising. the same clowns who rip TDOC owned CHGG.

all morons who chase in here
MMTLP...PRICE OF OIL IS GOING WAY UP...GOT TO LOVE THAT DIVIDEND
RemindMe! 17 hours
"Market is forward looking" my ass man. I was bag holding CHPT, VLTA, EVGO for months while Tesla climbed. Took significant losses on all of them. It was very clear in my eyes that EVs were only going to gain popularity and these companies provide infrastructure. Now all the sudden everyone realizes EVs are the future and they all moon in tandem? Fuck that
Chegg Chegg, only costs you an arm an a leg
Elon Musk is worth $300 billion and there are 7 million people on earth, that's like $42,000+ for each person!!!
Yeah after it went up 40% is the right opportunity
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
If you buy a Tesla with Tesla gains...you will be blessed.
should’ve bought at 17 u nut smart moneys out that bitch
I’d like 1 gay flair please
Unironically true
If you’d invested in the AMZN on sept 1st last year, you’d be up…

*checks notes*

…negative 6%, congrats!
Love the TDOC haters. Whenever I tell them I got in LVGO in 20's its crickets

Hahahaaha. Stock is going to be an absolute ripper
Real talk Tesla runs on solar
Im sorry can I have monkey explanation please
Anyone know how much PLTR was up today? Was it nice?
RIP to the people who sold their chegg puts at 30% loss before market closed 💀
The 10Y better hit 1.7% by the end of this week, or I’m sliding into bankruptcy
F
ANET just wow
They have even less money than europoors.
It's an EV so technically it doesn't BUT never doubt lord musk
Why do people believe fundamentals apply to TESLA? I bet if Tesla split again 1-5 it would break $1k a share in under a year again. Valuations don’t mean shit apparently lol
If TSLA replicates last year's movement, it should test 1600 before the end of this month
Purchased 11/19 CHGG puts 10 mins before close

Down 23% after hours ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
RKT is doing it 🚀😎🚀🚀😎✅
Growth for the quarter is trash. Its the start of new school year, should be 50% YoY. Stock is (was) valued for growth, not fundamentals.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Sold my TSLA $1200c for a comically high gain, and yet I feel like I made the losing decision.
If musk officially announces a split, we going 2000 pre-split
I’m fucking broke… thanks tesla puts
I bought super OTM ones for cheap and they doubled today
It’s certainly in a strong uptrend. Looks like it’s respecting the 50MA on the 2 hour chart so if I was gonna take a position I would wait for it to come back to that and then buy 80c 45dte+
F
I made a lot of money today playing IWM and XPEV. 

And I made money last week with TSLA puts.  Waiting to try to time the top of this to scale in puts again.
True
Buying 69 shares of $CHPT (ChargePoint) because EVs go vrrrooooommmm
Facts, would make a fuck ton
The UN has been useless since forever.
Who’s calls gonna lay a CHGG tomorrow morning?
Remember when CHGG was popular stock here..
TSLA is LITERALLY free money right now
Right???? I sold this at $80. So glad now.
Gme is green on the daily, weekly, monthly, 3 month, and outperformed tsla on the daily
&gt; I'm not a fucking ape.
need tesla to stock split so i can go balls deep and then sell calls when it skyrockets again
#[TSLA continues to moon on rumors that it will become the exclusive vehicle manufacturer of the UNSC in 2549](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCxv2daOwjQ)
Didn't buy any tsla huh?
Man oh man you can do what you want
nah yo this TSLA shit is getting outta hand finna go balls deep tomorrow in calls
Why is spy aftermarket not red af then
Real talk, does TSLA got more gas to burn????
Because Brandon is backed by UAW and Brandon didn't invite him to the EV summit. Brandon's new bill gives other EV vehicles not made by TSLA an [extra $4.5k in rebate.](https://twitter.com/truth_tesla/status/1454372185884270592)
It's days like this where I add guac at CMG
I was a LVGO shareholder at a starter position of $26. Thank you for your congratulations. ROI is 514%

Happy chasing

Also not in a downtrend anymore.

Every stock has this period before it really runs

ignore it and chase the ones up big this year. happy chasing
$1300 or $1500 open tomorrow?
SLOW
CHILDREN
CROSSING
Ho long did it take you to figure this out?
Yeah that’s why I didn’t do it, seemed to easy and the market wouldn’t react to reasonable thinking
Someone check and see if Trevor has a new driveway. Earnings could double
The bottom 50 percent is suffering with inflation for us to make our tendies. Remember this when getting in your lambo
No
all these ppl bitter and predicting a red day bc they didn’t buy tsla calls again today. stop being jealous
YEEEEEEE
bro i sold some calls before close today so theta doesn’t diminish my profit at open tomorrow. but i guess it doesn’t fucking matter
sounds like yer projecting bro
Seemed to obvious
Are you high rn
So what your saying is that my 1475 tesla calls printing by 11/5 lmfaooooooo
It went to 483, dude.
Except cash is needed to buy stocks. If the Fed ever raises rates this bubble is going to pop
Lmao Chegg 📉
why would he hate him? where else are you gonna put your money as a hedge against inflation but TSLA?
[deleted]
Cause I'm an ISLAND BOY
Ima just die thanks 😊 🙏
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
[deleted]
Those Chegg puts tmrw morning tho 👀
Yes
Talk is cheap, don't be a babby.
If I remember correctly it actually went over 500 but it was premarket or during foreign trading hours or something along those lines.

Hedge fund puppet
you really had to have some big sweaty balls to buy TSLA calls above 1k with any substantial amount of money imo , profits well deserved
Avis earnings came in hot
AGC
Elon needs to give me the 6 billion, I’ll make it useful
Stfu and buy calls. If you did what I did today, you would tripled your money this morning and not cry like a bitch here
mad that I have to wait till morning to hear the CRSR screeching
They definitely smoke crack at ark invest
Honestly expecting some chop prior to a leg down
Damn I was tempted to buy chegg puts too, I’d figure pandemic= no in person classes = no one buying books they’re just gonna google whatever material they need
Fundamentals don’t matter?

It never did.

🌎 🧑‍🚀🔫👨‍🚀
I might have to go all in on Tesla tomorrow. It feels like too good of an opportunity.
discounts on CHGG of course
Do a bet on it!
So she’s lagging the indices by 10+% and charging people for the pleasure to do so? I’m all in.

mod this man
Don’t need it for anything atm
Not a bad target price for some 2022 put calendars.
You can laugh at my behaviour

But I don't pay no heed

I'll never look behind me

My troubles will be few
why are you replying to yourself?
Iam Lookin at my watch list. Everything up at least 5%. And my watchlist is literally the shittiest stocks you can imagine.
Na it’s Kobe because it’s gonna go down in a spectacular crash.
Sorry Tesla bulls

I just bought 1 share of Tesla

I the GOAT jinx
Gme broke resistance let’s get it!
If you down vote someone just because they mention Tesla in a good way, go fuck your self, bagholding bitch ass bear.
dude the amount they make from credits now is almost nothing compared to their total profit, that’s an old argument. Also, they have been spending over 100 million in shares to pay Elon compensation plan every quarter and that’s ending in a few more quarters, their profits will only keep increasing.
Gme🚀🚀🚀🚀 the shorts are back!!!!!
Bro I’m up 40% this year
do u guys actually think elon musk is writing every tweet??? wtf how are u this gullible?
Outperforming wsb has to be the worst benchmark ever

CHGG implosion. You love to see it.
CHGG earnings honestly not terrible. I think this drop is an over reaction.
We know you never been with a girl when you think you have to pay ALIMONY to a girlfriend...

Yes to child support though...

Elon definitely has Let's Go Brandon as his alarm. He hates Brandon so much.
[deleted]
Just buy calls. That’s all the DD you need
Technically incorrect. GME never hit 500 a share.
Buying a hundred shares of TSLA when the market crashed was the biggest brain move and no one can convince me otherwise
That’s got a nice ring to it
Tsla the first quadrillion dollar company??
The answer is never. Just keep on making money until you lose it all then start all over.
Did Tesla Hit 1190 after 3:30 today? My stop loss triggered at 1190.5 but sold at 1193. Is that a mistake?
These 520c woulsld print
If I could afford a Tesla call I would do it
Burn it.
TAKE NOTE LOSERS. THIS IS A REAL BET! 😎
Yeah I think you’re just looking at Tesla lol
Should've bought CHGG puts hindsight 20/20
Elon is gay
None got it
Typo....TSLA $1550 call
How are you gonna afford the tuition to clown college?
I see my account consistently growing 5-10% a week and I keep asking myself when am I going to be happy
My CHGG puts that I literally gambled on should pay off nicely.
Bought a 12/01 SPY $470c at close. Nothing stops this bull.
taking profits is fucking retarded $tesla
Isnt GME a RKT?
There would be no crash until midterm elections
I see Cathie is now up around 3% total on her ETFs this year, a few months ago everyone was saying how shit she was.... but she's still outperforming you at 3% in Nov....
I wish people would just admit it is a momentum play and not come in here pumping with some fundamental BS.

$CHPT and $COURS THIS WEEK 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻💯💯💯

Yeah for sure.  I mean I'm just scalping puts when it looks like they're cheap.  Just not sure we've ever seen this scale of a ramp up.
When I see your profile pic I thought it was me
Yep.  My portfolio jumped over $2,000 and then returned just as I figured out what caused it.
🤣

can it be 9:30 tuesday already
Cathie was right.
Wait what happened to chegg

My prediction: ATVI posts obscene numbers tomorrow but dumps another 5-10% on Fed FUD.
Oh valley of plenty

CHGG guh
&gt; Yes, it does.
That makes both of us. I actually got downvoted for letting people know about this free money. I got 3 weekly calls for 1180C. Still holding
college kids are not cheating as much anymore.
Feb 2023?
Yup, I'm short PLUG at $35 and there has been excessive autistic screeching happening
 value investing in roaring twenties is to buy way otm calls on a high multiple stock.

/u/crimsonchin24 (1/0) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1200.0 when it was 1098.18 and it did, congrats retard.
I don’t think anyone believes this is retail driven or that TSLA will actually hold these valuations. Most of us are just trying to make a buck and get out before the curtain falls.
My TSLA 2000c’s 11/5 really doubled 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yeah she’s cute
every day for the past week after close I tell myself, "I should just go all in on Tesla tomorrow" and every morning I chicken out and only make a small amount of money compared to everyone else
Right? It’s just a straight line up.
If you adjust back for the split Tesla would be at fucking $6000 today. Jesus fucking Christ and I remember when it hit $1k the first time thinking that was incredible
Elon straight VIOLATING these global hunger fools on Twitter rn 💀

The starving kids forced to give bj’s to UN workers for food link has me deceased 💀💀💀
TSLA 1500c
I guess my $CHGG calls we're not a good idea
Really hope no one sold CHGG puts
1275ish is my conservative bet if FOMC ruins the fun on things. 1300+ doesn't seem out of the question though
Pump and dump, then buy back in after it pulls back...or could pump and never look back...hard to tell when retail involved.
NVAX go brrrrr
SPOT caught a lot of calls being bought today, bullish close over 300 imo, see what tomorrow brings.
I almost bought puts on TSLA at $400, glad I didn’t. Feel like going full 🌈🐻 now, might enter $1000 2022 puts on Thursday.
What does short term quadruple top mean? 🤔
This is a 🤡 market. What do you expect?
What in the fuck? How did Chegg eat so much shit?
Europoor here.  Came for power hour.  Discovered markets closed 15 minutes ago.  Damned clock change.

Me too. Pump could go to infinity and beyond but maybe it corrects a bit instead.
Why tomorrow? I keep expecting the train to stop but it just... doesnt
I hope everyone loaded up with META aka FB
Nice
Don't think we're gonna see a correction until Feb

Step 1 Apply for options step 2 yolo all your money into calls
TSLA right now is like a bunch of huge hedge funds/algs in the Softbank size class in terms of capital decided to buy billions worth of stock and calls.

It's just hard to believe that a majority of this is being driven by retail.

Tens of billions worth of premium is trading hands every day in TSLA calls and puts.  Is retail really trading that size volume in options?

Who knows when this gamma ramp ends but as long as this much money is chasing could go a bit longer.
Plz buy in. My puts need your help.

What makes you think they can maintain such a disparity in margins? ( if that is actually their true margin aside from credits)  They will most certainly face margin compression with the amount of competition scaling up.
I can buy a Tesla with my profits from them. I’ll keep driving my Corolla and wait until I can afford 2

I don’t mean sell forever… obviously buy back in once it pulls back a little. But this cannot continue indefinitely. Eventually we will get a precipitous drop that will make tons of fomoers bag holders

8bn pump on Wednesday and 6bn pump on Friday. That's only the Fed. Ecb pumps at European open, but they not transparent with the amount
Just one tiny 1200c would have pumped from 1400 to 4000
Imagine touching garbage like CHGG 🤣
My brother in law is a programmer and he’s got an interview for some project at GME. I told him to try and get me the chick on their websites number.
Chegg is the embodiment of the consequences of being a snitch 😂

I'm too poor to plunge my whole portfolio into TSLA calls, but I trade spreads on it. If I ever bought a straight call on it the market gods would surely plunge it 20% to wipe me out. That's just the way the universe works.
2022, allegedly. But big money also says it should be back to business like mid-late 2022 so it could be like a 2020-esque one month bear market for all we know

How tf you rat on the fucking people paying for your service?
Don’t know, don’t care. Doubled my portfolio.
Healthy pullback to 1200 tsla?

I guess Karma is coming back around after losing $4k on buying GME at the top 😂

Tesla back where it belongs. #1 stock of all time. GOAT.
TSLA valuation is the dumbest shit I've ever seen and I saw GME go to 500 a share.
When though. I might just fomo back in at least some.   


at this rate cash really is gonna be worthless

Bears lose again! Recession canceled!
So many opportunities to make life-changing gains over the past couple years. You have to be absolutely retarded to have lost money over that time.

It's me. I'm retarded 🤡
Apples and oranges comparison here but hear me out-
The difference between TSLA’s pump up and GME’s is that TSLA has a legitimate future. GME was pumped to fuck over the shorts. TSLA has something to seriously invest into. That’s why it’s pumped so much for this long now. +400 in the past month. You can count on one hand how many stocks can do that. 
Sure Tesla will eventually pullback, but it won’t be for very long until it rips again and again. Tesla is the future.
Up 300% on plug call lets see where this goes
$TSLA is undervalued, their margins are close to 30% ( and will keep growing with the upcoming new battery cells and improvements in manufacturing )compared to 10% for GM
[deleted]
Should have rolled that into tesla calls you would have leveled up lol
IONQ can easily go to 20 at this rate
Budgeting bro, it'll take some time. That &amp; the housing market crashing at some point lmao

Wrong forum.
crazy
Chegg let the cats out the bag 😂
Past 6 months?
I was about to buy a call an hour ago glad i didn't
it means an option that expires within a week and far out of the money usually, such as a 2k 11/5 TSLA call..a supreme FD
I think CHGG said the N word
Fun fact, a 20% drop in TSLA would bring it back to where it was not even 2 weeks ago
Don’t worry bears there’s a TSLA gap in the 900s, just throw your whole portfolio down on some weeklies you got this can’t go tits up
Alright people unfortunately I'm calling the top for tsla tomorrow. Why? Because I'm gonna jump in again so to lose all my money it will have to go down.
Tesla is the next Tesla
Sounds like a regular monday to me
Anyone gonna hedge for jpow on Wednesday or just me?

Gotta add to my share count some how. I have no cash to put into these accounts!

So 1300 tomorrow?
when it comes it will be biblical
Grats on not getting banned you tard
Anyone still questioning About META? BTW bought some movie theaters stocks ..😎
This is as dumb as January, but since it takes more cash to play there’s fewer tards involved, nice going man
Normies seeing the massive TSLA gains is what makes normies wanna start stonk trading

Where's the joker that said he'd short Tesla with 1m?

Idk your tickers for the 7, but sure stonks always go up. TSLA though lmao no, this is a very unique opportunity. Bank as much as you can
kind of funny to think if a Sophomore in college decided to skip college, yolo all of their loans into TSLA leaps and double down after expiration they'd have more than 10 times the average college graduates lifetime earnings. lmao.

FD? Rather new to all this.
You’re right. It was flat early in morning.
They pushed interest rates down to 0, market goes up. They announce they will start to raise it, market goes... up. Market doesn't seem to care about interest rates.

SOFI calls keep printing baby!
If your portfolio is down 99% all time, the trick is to just make a way bigger deposit and get small percent gains on that to cancel it out.

Trust me on this. I had to learn it the hard way. My first time around, I tried making a way bigger deposit and losing that too, and it turns out then the problem just gets even worse.
Anyone else playing the potential Garmin buyout? I bought a bunch of 12/17 $145C’s as a lottery ticket play.
SoFi bruh
ICLN back on my menu
I did this but with $1300 call. I didnt yolo my whole account but I got some at 5.00 a contract this morning sold 1 min to close for over 100% gain. Part of me should of just held to tomorrow opening bell.
Watch tsla kiil entire market again. Fuk
YANG bagholders are hilarious. 

You know who else bet against Xi? Jack Ma. 

And where’s Jack Ma now? 🤷🏼‍♂️
Tired of this fake ass market, TSLA should be worth at least $2T by now.

Well Tesla put was not a good idea. Rip
I have those!  Got mine at 310
so much less stress and adrenaline too
It's not sexy, but after picking up ARVL in the middle of a pump then dump, it's been a steady riser for the last month or so.
Gme did better today
Watching the Tesla train go. Not on it. I’m just at the station. Haven’t even bought any ticket 🎫

i wonder how the dude that was shorting tsla is doing right about now, hope he got out to die another day
I paper handed my Tesla calls 30 minutes before closing. Profit is profit, but damn I wish I held. Good luck to the rest of you.

I’m literally like 3 weeks into stock buying. Not retarded enough for puts/calls so I’m just buying stock. I’m all green… between like 7 stocks and two whole TSLA shares. This is normal right?
It’s kind of a gay bear thing…I wouldn’t expect you to understand
goodness, I love the leverage of iv. up bigly on just 1 1300 call bought right before close
Ready for tomorrow’s 87 front page posts “elon musk made $768 gajillion yesterday and I’m still over here eating cold hot dogs! The system is broken!”
forget Google, Tesla is coming for the gold market
Are you holding puts or somn?
TSLA 5K EOW. In all seriousness, nobody has any fucking clue where TSLA goes. Bears are so fucked and that's all that matters.
time for all these TSLA millionaires to post their gains again
Maybe not so retarded this time....just maybe...
1400 bc fuck it 😂
or be a real moron and buy a put at close like I did!
I know the second I join in on TSLA it'll drill to the fucking core of the earth, you're welcome everyone I'm staying away
I'd rather try sword swallowing or juggling fire
The 52 week range on TSLA is fucking wild man
Burry closed his positions before the run up I believe
Yes.  Sold my Tesla calls for 70% gain but it kept going up so I just bought more calls.  Dumped my puts this morning for a loss but erased all those losses on the calls and made money
TSLA 1200 has a nice ring to it.
TSLA puts I bought a few mins into open are only down 40%. Tbh I thought the damage would be worse. I consider this a win
I put half my account in various TSLA options and ended up 80% on the entire account

Being a moron is fun
Oh nooo lmao
GREE and AGC
1250
Both I yolo’d some puts. Feelin dirty
VLTA up big today and has room to keep running
Today I asked SPY for 460 before the eod. When I wasn’t looking, she jumped to 460 at 3:58.  She’s sneaky.
100 percent cash. Crash won’t happen until monetary policy changes. This happened in 1929 and 1999 with rising rates
I told everyone to get in tesla in premarket if you like free money. Hope yall listened
Its stil PUMPING...make it stop i am drained
i'm too hyped. means we're probably red tomorrow, sorry bros
Sshhhhhhh don’t tell the permabulls.  Tomorrow is going to be ugly.
$TSLA up 8.49%. Thank you, World Hunger!

Can we please have a UN agency tweet something to Elon every week?
Wish I had the starting capital to get into TSLA today. Did make some Green off $F today!
you must be stupid to not buy tesla calls daily. 

I'm fucking stupid.
Not a good day for Bezos, getting double cucked
Is the naked part that important?
1475 calls didn’t fill at 359
Taking bets on what TSLA opens at
bought tsla fd's, sold for 100% gain, could have been 300% - tale as old as time, i think i've finally hit the point of zen enlightenment (after diamond handing thousands of dollars into the ether) where I finally can enjoy the tendies I have, and not mourn the tendies that could have been

on that note, don't forget to keep some of your gains in cash if you hit a moonshot, don't wanna be caught without any dry powder if/when the time comes
If I didn’t go to college and put all that money in tsla I’d be dummer and richer
"While meme stocks have soared on the back of retail trader chatter and individuals pumping up their bets on social media, Monday’s rally looks to have the fingerprints of Wall Street pros, according to trading data on Fidelity’s platform. None of the original meme stocks were among the 10 most bought on the platform, with sales of both GameStop and SofFi overshadowing buy orders."

Wall Street pumps always end with retail holding the bag. And the pumps aren't that cool anyway.
It just keeps going up holy fuck
Like ethically or financially
Donkey: What's yo' name?

Shrek: Uhhh... Shrek
really what's another trillion worth?
AMC
I seem to recall getting ridiculed when I set a banbet for TSLA 1250 for this Friday 🤔🤔
You have to PUSH
Dip was today...
Already up to $1215 AH
[deleted]
i mean literally tesla is like you don’t wanna get in because it’s been running so fucking much, then you finally say fuck it and get in and your options immediately tank 70% and you say never again, only to repeat e process 4 months later
Imagine still talking in the daily discussion thread
Tesla doing what the apes wish their stock would do 😂😂😂
#JUST GET CHPT AND COUR = THANK ME LATER
up $3k on Boeing today :) so typical. drops under $210 , pumps back.
Easy mode. I love it.
Sounds good. Up a few bucks after hours already
TSLA doubled since June.  Like… wat?
LCID
I bought calls 10 min ago
Elon about to be worth twice then Bezos wtf
Tesla 57 % up this month ....... mhhhhhhh. Maybe it's time to call Burry .

Thats not reasonable no matter what. and I love Tesla and made some nice tendies.

But I smell short here, at least short term . Thats to much
1 mil buy order on spy before close, bears fucked
Bears tryna make sense of a market pumped to the tits in fed money LOL 
#WhERe DuhH CorrecTioN aT
holy shit, msft calls printed at the end.
I grabbed a 1525 for memes and it's up 170%. Didn't even sell it
Trading my PLTR stocks for NVDA was a great move. Wish I did it a year ago…
Yes but also no, ya know?
I’d cream. Got 2 ATM puts today and I don’t wanna lose all my moneys
Imagine I was going to go into TSLA but decided not to because I thought it would drop after reaching 1200 so it wasn't worth it.
ELON FUCKING MUSK
I don’t know whether to laugh or cry…I swear I’m going to rage scream into my pillow as soon as I’m home and naked
Everyone, please remember to plug in your TSLA tonight so it will be charged in the morning. I have some profit I'd like to have for once.
[deleted]
msft calls bought 2 min before close go from up 15% to down 3% lmao
Dear diary:

&gt;I wanted to yolo my account into SPY $459 0-Dte calls when they were $.20, but I was too scared😞..

Sincerely: yours truly
by 5 pm
I think you’re going to see bank account 0 tomorrow
[deleted]
nah man it's gonna be +100 everyday so wait for 1600 eow
I have 100 percent cash. Like why didn’t I either
Tesla Better be Ree af
AND ITS STILL FUCKING GOING???????!!!!!!! I thought for sure we would get at least some pullback off of 1200 but it sliced through that shit like butter
My moves tomorrow, umm...... 

FOMO into TSLA at its All Time High?
Man people be wanting to work for tsla just for the stock options
If TSLA dips again tomorrow, I’m jumping in.

Fuck this, I wanna get rich.
AMD. TAN. FSR. SPY
I got out of OCGN good luck
Someone dare me to buy Tesla puts
&gt; I'm sorry, what?
I don’t know what to do with my hands
TSLA 2000 is NOT a meme!
Hold!
Soo how much is Elon worth now?

400 Billion?
So if some absolute moron had Yolo’d their entire account into TSLA 11/5/21 1700c they’d be up 100% just today. I’m not a moron so I didn’t do this…
TSLA is under extended
Bought Tesla 1400 weeklies 10 minutes ago and they’re already up 30%.  Have been a a Tesla bear forever but this market is moving and I like money.  Calls are making me money
What am I actually missing with Tesla in the last few days?

I’ve tried and other then the hertz order I can’t see what’s popping the stock 5-8% every day this last week
I did the same but on FB.
Even in death(After Hours) Tesla is still serving
Winner of the day award goes toooooo : TSLA 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Meta Platforms 11/19 $355c
Only means it will keep going up 🥲
I have puts. 

Before you ask, yes, I am a power bottom.
TSLA: shit man sure wish I had 100 billion more dollars

*6 hours later*

TSLA: Nice
Fuck googling, I’m tesla’ing from now on, they got all the answers to the questions I have.
[Me, a new Tesla bull, having a 30% day.](https://imgur.com/a/LsPYBGm)

‘![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)'
Get in on RKLB. They have an upcoming launch in 2 weeks.
It’s still running for a few more hours lol
Bro if you are holding anything related to Tesla at this point you belong in a mental institution. At the very least you should have taken like 90% profits
[deleted]
Make sure to sell them in the morning before fomc please
Gotta be all TSLA all the time. The main shares are too rich for my blood. Put down $1300 CDN and made $30 in the last 10 mins of trading lol
Not too late. do it now
I was memeing when I bought this 11/5 1800 and 2k call but its getting more serious by a the minute
TSLA… 🤯
Going to be a wild month I can already tell.
SPY did me dirty
Bruh…
Tesla is coming for Google lmao
The Fed says the party must go on
XPEV and LI crushed their October delivery numbers before earnings.

My only regret is not buying more shares.

So TSLA still goin up, huh?
$1200! to get out of TSLA now or not...
Offloading the rest of my FWRD calls.  Might exercise the last contract.

Also, whack it vigorously watching NVDA print.
UP 10k today on TSLA. Idk might hold, might sell
I should have dumped my entire portfolio into Tesla, up 20% since last week. Ride this bubble, autists! 😂
I am going to jerk off so hard... you dont even know
Ufff. I feel you
Fuck my life, why didn’t I stick to the plan and YOLO on TSLA this morning?

At least the MSFT calls I bought at the low are up a little 😫
Tesla is an abomination
The GME puts I sold are up 50% from today lol. thanks apes.
First!!! Fuck...
What a fucking day! GME &amp; Tesla both ripped, same time tomorrow
Up 13K on my Tesla stocks on the daily. Like the old times. me like.
That was an absolutely madness TSLA lol
Need to see Tesla 1000 tomororw
Is JPOWPOW speaking tomorrow and are the markets gonna freak?
Me
MY MOVE IS TO WATCH TESLA MAKE ME FUCKING MONEY
Without day trading I call it market on hard mode currently what I’m on lol
Y'all got played

&amp;#x200B;

 They're pumping so you can hold their expensive bags.
Final minute bull run has my nipples so fucking hard. They could cut diamonds holy shit.
Imagine me thinking the safe bet was 1150/1200 TSLA spread. 

It's up 50% since I got it this morning. 

If I did a straight up 1150 call, I'd be up 110%
Yo fuck meta platforms
If you want the gains you need to visualize it. Imagine the zeros... $0.00
You have no option other than buy calls and laugh like a maniac in this market right now. Pure euphoria
At this point the Fed has no excuse for not raising rates. Markets can handle it
So those of y’all holding your TSLA calls overnight, you know who you are. You deserve to lose money, you greedy monkey 🤐🤐🤐
Days like this create fomo hoping Tesla keeps the run up tomorrow
[deleted]
The fuck is going on   
regret sitting on any cash at all
DKNG DKNG DKNG
#Today’s EOD moves: $CHPT for EV charging, $COUR for online education earnings surprise play
Made money today. Told myself to go cash till tmw. Bought a NVDA call eod 😞
Buying this dip on the most undervalued company in the history of companies.  It as a minimum should be valued at what FB, TWTR, VIAC and T are combined.  DWAC and Donnie are going to take them all out.
TSLA back to $300.... After 4 to 1 split.
honestly I don't think Tesla is going to drop for the next few weeks at least but I don't think it's going to go up either

the premiums are too tasty for citadel to not be theta gang right now
Fuck you TSLA
Calls finally printing omg lol might load up tomorrow
+245% in a day 

I finally got in on time instead of buying the top 🥺
Elon is god
# it gotta be a simulation bruh
$ELON to MARS
for some reason I decided to sell my AMD, NVDA, SHOP stock today
[deleted]
day trading is a game changer, so much control
Meme stock rallye, GME, AMC and BB back again
You guys are welcome. I bought SPY puts 15 minutes ago.
Yeah, TSLA……
I like to look at these [TSLA calls](https://i.imgur.com/DrZp4pM.png) in my account that are up a million dollars just today, and pretend I actually have money. Too bad they are really part of a credit spread that's going to be a max loss.
Bearish
Why the fuck DIDN'T I fomo into TSLA?
[deleted]
made $3200 today, but only up $800 net
[deleted]
And OCGN does what it needed to do in the AH.
BRO WHAT THE FUCKING HELLLLLLLL

This move from Tesla is the craziest shit I have ever seen. 200B in market cap generated over like a week
Elon pls stahp, some of these bears are trying to keep their virginity!
SPY 470c
I made a month’s salary today :/ 

If QCOM cucks me on Wednesday I am going to be a *sad* panda
Got spy put at close like retard

[deleted]
Holy fuck tesla, I am about to CUM

The SPY 9-day RSI has been overbought for like a week now, and even the 14-day is almost there at this point.

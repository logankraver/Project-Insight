/u/REALLYANNOYING (1/1) made a bet that AMAT would go to 151.26 when it was 141.5 and it did, congrats you fuckin nerd.
Wow.  Was PTON flipping homes too?
I swear I’d be a millionaire by now if I wasn’t such a bitch.
I need Hertz to announce the purchase of 100k PTONs

/u/dazednconfuse (3/1) made a bet that PTON would go to 80.0 when it was 92.71 and it did, congrats retard.
My moves tomorrow, wake up and thank Jesus, Allah, Buddha, Ghandi, Odin, and a couple others for not letting me buy Peloton. Lmao
My god I have a pton 85p
When I invested in PTON last week, I assumed an unprofitable stationary bicycle company trading at 40x sales would never go down. 
These markets are rigged against me!!
Chegg, Peloton, Zillow

The holy trinity of bag holders 🙌🏻
Hahahahahaha jokes on RKT now I can’t pay my mortgage
Jealous of PTON put holders
I lost $2k today. Ready to double that loss tomorrow.
If Fb goes above $340s tomorrow I’ll eat Zuckerbergs ass in the metaverse
Can’t believe I’m holding all this Pton. Getting rekt
PTON reports 1Q22 EPS of $(1.25) [down 725% y/y] vs est of $(1.07) [miss by 16.82%]  &  Revs of $805.2M [up 6.24% y/y] vs est of $810.76M [miss by 0.69%]

Guides 2Q22 Revs of $1.1B-$1.2B vs est of $1.49B
Guides down FY22 Revs from $5.4B to $4.4B-$4.8B vs est of $5.5B

Horrible earnings + terrible guidance = !GUH
Guess I'll ride my Peleton to the Wendy's job fair first thing tomorrow.
Just admit it, your wives all gained weight even with the peloton in the house.  Your wives used it for for 3 weeks and quit. Now you're all stuck with payments, lol.   PTON tanking because angry husbands everywhere be shorting.
Love Doordash. I get to pay $23 for a $10 burrito, it arrives 2 hours late. And the driver has probably licked it. This is the future of business.
Zillow and Peloton should merge so they can throw a bike into all the Zillow houses that are going to be sold.  Becky's will eat that shit up and it's win-win!

Glad my MBA wasn't for nothing....
Gary Black said that TSLA investors would be happy to see some "air come out of the balloon" because they don't want TSLA to "become a casino stock."

/u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1100.0 when it was 1206.4 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
If you bought PTON calls, you were simply retarded.

If you are thinking about buying PTON dip after earnings, you can't be saved.
Just saw a homeless dude collect five bucks at a stoplight and it hit me. This dude is more profitable than my portfolio rn
Pton gonna be 0 at open
[RUMORS OF MY DEATH HAVE BEEN GREATLY EXAGGERATED](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmt5z6/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_november_05_2021/hjbz9eg)
I made $65 scalping TSLA today. I'm a big deal.
People out there struggling with multiple jobs. Making enough money just to feed their kids. 

I push a few buttons and make $10,000 off NVDA in one day.  

Feels wrong. Feels like I found a secret too.
Just woke up from a good, peaceful nap. How are my $PTON calls, anyone checked?
God fucking dammit the PTON guy was right
An exercise bike company wasnt worth 26 B?

Im shocked… *shocked*
Jesus Christ!! Did PTON kill more babies??
SQ absolutely disgraceful
I need to get better at exiting positions
PTON dropped more on earnings than when it ate a toddler. Impressive and savage.
The market is basically saying: if you are not a mega cap or part of FAANG, don't even bother reporting your earnings.
Never invest in Americans exercising. Bad idea. Burgers? Yes. Things to keep us lazy? Yes.  Work and workouts? No
NVDA to Valhalla and beyond 🚀
I could stare at a girl’s ass all day
PYPL : bro we make so much money

PYPL : “seriously, here’s the the money”

Market : -30%
Guys I’m sure the in home fitness company with a $2000 barrier valued at 24 billion is going to be just fine now that gyms are completely open
When you're beating SPY by 2% for the year and all it cost was 3 years off your lifespan from the stress, your hair falling out, procrastination of actual career goals, your mental health, your social skills, and thinking about trading 24/7 🥴👍
Does anyone else largely ignore every post on this sub and only post in here?
This market is officially fucking retarded
To that guy with the $PTON DD, nice call bro.
Oh no my life savings
Today I made what I make in 2 months of working(40 hour weeks)
Mr. Foley, in Thursday’s letter to Peloton investors, said the price cuts helped sales but “there remains a lingering perception that Peloton is a luxury item.”

Lol cause it is. Your average American family can't afford a 2,000 dollar treadmill or whatever. Plus a 40 a month membership after that.
BULLISH TECH BULL MARKET UNTIL THE END OF TIME


STAY IN THE MARKET AND GET RICH BOYS!
Honey I shrunk the portfolio
Tomorrow we get a SPY +1% day on the expectation that JPow will be reappointed and then another SPY +1% day on Monday when he is indeed reappointed. Sorry bears, you chose the wrong year to be gay
Y'all laughing at Cathie, but Mrs. Wood is ultimately the one holding the market up. Buying all these flailing companies, keeping them afloat ensuring they rise with the market rather than sink it.

She is like Noah, but for future tech, hence ARK. History books will be written about the Saviour that saved us from a recession.🌊⛵⛵🌊

/u/CoolHandsFT (1/2) made a bet that TSLA would go to 2000.0 when it was 1217.49 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Watch PTON will redesign the bike with a dildo seat and sell it as a sex toy
Market Pullback at 8:47 AM tomorrow.  Not sure of time zone, that is just what the Lady in the truck stop bathroom told me when she asked to read my palms while I was taking a dump.

hashtagblessed
Not sure people are really understanding how grave PTONs earnings call was. They really aren't selling bikes anymore even with lowered prices. Expenses have only gone up with how their stuff's made. And definitely worst of all is that bike sales aren't translating to ongoing revenue from subscriptions etc. 

I mean you didn't need a crystal ball to know that they wouldn't do as well after covid but you know they're trying everything they can to keep numbers as attractive as possible for as long as possible and even still, they're having to come out this soon even with Delta variant and admit that they pretty much have no hope of ever being profitable at their current volumes. I wouldn't be surprised to see the market cap move towards 5-10 billion in the next year or two which would be a stock price of $16-25.
lmao at that PTON smash... dragged into the depths of hell until the very last minute of AH

during their earnings call an analyst asked "Uh, who exactly are your target customers?" and the CEO literally replied "we don't wanna give away our secret sauce"

well played, sir, well played 😂
As the market keeps hitting all time highs it reminds me of my favorite mango man tweet

If your 409k’s aren’t +90% you don’t belong here
What PTON needs to do to shake up their model and reach their core demographic is introduce a unicycle model that also includes facepaint, a red curly wig, and a squeezy red nose that honks!
Wow. I’ve lost a shit ton of money on PTON. Fml
PTON should partner up with TSLA. Their bikes could be linked to the powerwall and used as energy generator. Lol
PSA.

PTON still has 64.50$ to drop
Airbnb stays >28 days length keep growing. This is the work-from-anywhere trend that will continue to grow as younger people with a traveling mindset enter mid career. It’s amazing to me how much the market is missing this but instead is so focused on electric vehicles. 

Long ABNB.

People in 2030 will work differently from how we do now. Work-from-anywhere will make up at least 20% off knowledge work jobs for at least 2 months of each year.
Cramer the type of guy to take a group photo and say ‘now a silly one’
YOLOing my money into the stock market just to try to get out of the rat race that is life
Peloton? More like peloGONE. Amirite guys? Guys?
The dude in the blue suit on CNBC is stressed. He either has PTON calls or is long PTON
PTON Puts DD spot on
#PTON $1p 11/12/21
I have jerked off every day this month.
I regret nothing. Except for the trades I woulda coulda shoulda made
Remember to always trade emotionally
AMC Executive 1: How are we gonna make money? No one goes to theaters anymore.

AMC Executive 2: IDK. Sell popcorn at the mall? TONS of people go to the mall.
If by chance job numbers are good 

Market will fucking go green.

If by chance job numbers are bad

Guess what market will still fucking go green🤡
Can’t sleep. WAY over leveraged
Days like today make me want to be on-set with Alex Baldwin
NET makes TSLA look undervalued
Wait, so almost half of SQ sales were Bitcoin?
I really hope wfh never ends. I’ve been doing my actual job after market hours cuz I spend all day tuned into the markets made some sick gains I wouldn’t have otherwise if I was stuck in a meeting or some shit
Who knew that F was gonna make me rich? This is truly the most entertaining timeline.
You guys ever consider that all your accomplishments are by chance and you’re actually just mad fucking retarded
Depression with money is much more manic than depression when you’re broke
I just like to jack off and think about all the trades I’ve missed out on and how much money I’d have, and my ex getting back with me cuz I wouldn’t be poor
Draftkings is either going to blow everyone away and shoot up 20% or miss and tank another 20%. Tomorrow I lose $30k or I make a few hundred k. Yeesh.
How many peloton bikes are simply clothes hangers by now?
PTON is building the fitness metaverse.

Eventually we’ll all be playing GTA on our bikes
I want to either 10x my life savings tomorrow or lose it all what gives
Honestly who didn't see this coming?

I lost 7500 today, still gonna go get chipotle cuz if not I’ll prob die lol
There’s so many people jacked to the tits on TSLA using leverage when it finally drops it’s gonna be nasty
#as I have stated in the morning, PTON PUTS ARE MY WAY TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Here I am stressing for an hour if I should buy some new jeans and shoes this year meanwhile people are thinking for a solid 5 minutes signing on for 84 month long loans on 70k trucks they get for grocery shopping.
Americans are fat for a reason. Stop investing in fitness companies. It's a dead end

Edit: Except Planet Fitness. They have Pizza Tuesdays
pton call buyers the kind of people that wear a helmet while riding their peloton
Damn someone just replied to a post I made 8 years ago without batting an eye
Can’t sleep knowing I sold my NVDA early this week for $2000 profit when it could’ve been $40,000 today. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)

Lol PTON so predictable.  People go back to the gym...duh
If I could go back in time, I wouldn’t save Jesus or kill Hitler. I’d stop myself from buying PTON shares
Stick an iPad on a bicycle. Boom! $26B business.
WSB has been absolutely slaying this market my god

This is the only place where I can scream fuck you when I’m losing money and most of you can understand my pain and I appreciate that

Tesla stock started really going off after my DD about how the car is engineered for blowjobs.

Jpow is a goddamn American hero, and if you disagree, ur probably a gay ass bear

Jumbos want to go back to the gym.
Please fly NVDA
Sometimes I wonder how my life would be if I never discovered options trading. Probably happier, wealthier, and healthier

Tesla raising prices in response to EV credits. The more you subsidize something the higher the prices.

Lol pton. What smooth brain has bags from $150+? Rip. 

It’s a fucking treadmill you Neanderthals. In what world do you go long on that. You can just walk outside for free dumbass.
If you didn’t sell pton earlier this year when their gay ass treadmill merked a kid, you were a fucking greedy pig
I'm not a religious man, but everytime I see articles with ARKKs new purchases I pray that none of my stocks are on it 🙏


Honestly it's impressive they managed to remain red today.

4 months I was at my peak and seriously considered dumping it into AMD and turning it back on in 6 months. Instead I went with a shotgun approach on short term options on different tickers. Anyways, anyone want their dick sucked?

Did Pton kill someone?
I lost so much money last year buying puts on PTON. So glad to see that piece of shit stock get burned
I am immensely pleased that Blue Origin wasn't able to get away with its bullshit lawsuit for not getting a piece of the lunar lander contract
I remember when SPY was $430 in September and I bought calls despite 🌈🐻 screaming it was the end.  Good times.

I was destined to be poor 😔

I should have listen to Russ in Silicon Valley when he said a company that has revenue is dogshit. Investors only buy companies that don’t make money.
It's year 2030. The market cap of FAANG + MSFT + TSLA + NVDA + AMD pretty much make 99% of SPY and QQQ while the rest of the market turned into penny stocks.
Mike burry been on a 13 year losing streak bro that’s crazy. Wonder if he’s got any money left

I'm a natural 🌈🐻.  I hate QE, I think the Fed should be audited or abolished. 

That being said, I've nearly lost all my gay bear instincts. I'm buying leaps on a few names and convinced SPY 485 eoy minimum. 


Just a warning ⚠️
Ugh broke even then completely squandered it. I hate this feeling
At this rate Spy will hit 500 in 2 weeks
Can we all come to the agreement that 

percentage gain > absolute monetary gain?

Like, I'm glad you turned 100k to 200k, but I'd be more impressed at a guy who turned 10k to 100k
Peloton's business plan got leaked.

"Let's glue iPads to exercise bikes and sell them for $4k to see how many of them we can sell. It worked for Tesla when they glued iPads to their cars."
Thank you to the kind retards who told me to dump NET! I hope y’all become billionaires in this life 🙏
At this rate I'm gonna have to get a day job soon
Why is SOFI drilling
Man I'm getting so stressed being a day trader. It's like new day, new fire to put out lmao
Ok where's the NVDA millionaire gain porn?
COIN!
Nowadays everything is turning into subscription model. Can't wait for my local strip club to take on this model.
I think u/visualmod is becoming sentient. That bot is an A+ shit poster.
I cant wait to tell my kids about how an exercise bike company was worth nearly 50B at its peak lol
Who would have thought people would wise up to paying $4k and 70 a month for a bike with an iPad taped on it
Peloton's story looks a lot like GoPro.
Red days make me want to curl up in a blanket and watch lord of the rings.

Every CNBC talking head two months ago: We’re underweight tech in anticipation of tapering and rising yields and overweight financials, cyclicals, and industrials ☠️🤡
Only reason TSLA is going up is because I didn't get into the play
I may of overdone it with spy.

I have 10 spy 470c expiring tomorrow. 20 spy 475c 11/8 and 10 spy 520c 1/22
Tesla baby what is u doin
Goodbye PTON my old friend
**PUTS on chipotle I got a burrito and I only got three strands of Barbacoa with 99% full of rice😡**
F calls for us poors so we may someday trade TSLA calls. As life goes
Imagine SPY hits 469 at 4:20 PM tomorrow.

I'd break NNN for that.
I will make my first million in the stock market. I will make my first million in the stock market. I will make my first million in the stock market.
No moves tomorrow! Everything I have has run up this week, from Ford to AMD and Nvidia. CRSR is up even almost 10%. What a week, I’m not touching a thing. But, say a prayer for tomorrow, Draftkings may bite me in the ass if earnings are trash. 😂
I hate not having alot to invest.....but slowly I ma get there
There are 56.1 million millionaires worldwide at the moment. 88% of all millionaires are self-made, and 84% have a college degree. The number of billionaires in 2021 reached a new, all-time high: 2,755 individuals.      
      
With a world population of 7.9 B, millionaires make up     
.007 % of world population.

Got approved for options today, first thing I did was get 5 11/12 20C’s on F. 

What buy now
By all means let's go to 480 and blow the top off this thing. Makes perfect sense.
Can’t sleep need NVDA to open at $300 😱😱
*Actually* made money today.

Time to make some questionable decisions tomorrow!
Cathie bought dkng🤯🤯
Disney is such a sack of shit lately.


It's okay, I'm here to save them. Integrated with the Disneyworld experience, you can get any Disney princess escort of your choice for $3k a pop. Featuring authentic costumes, well rehearsed characters, and desperate hourglass figured college girls. And I'm pretty sure I'm low balling here. I feel like I'd pay more than that myself for banging Red Jasmine. They're sitting on a fucking gold mine and are too stupid to see it.
seriously contemplating tossing another 10k into 0dte FB 340c
the metaverse, Neuralink, agi, synthetic bio, designer babies, space exploration 

the future’s gonna be insane. no way I’m fucking with neuralink tho
anyone else just buy calls anyway when you run out of daytrades and see what happens. its almost like pdt is like a challenge.
Is there anything worse than being a sad drunk?
Red days are illegal from now on
Been at this company 3 years, pretty sure the guys that just joined 2 months ago make a solid amount more than me. Shits annoying and makes me want to jump ship
I need Spy to drop to 464 so I can reload 470c's. Cmon paper handed Friday crowd, give me that dip.
Hoping to wake up to DKNG not fucking me. Not feeling great since Cathie bought today…
How is Cathie funds solvent everything she touches turns to shit
Lmfaooo NVDA
Back2back double digit days?
**NVDA calls at open 🥵**
**NVDA over 320 today 🥵**
Looks like nvdia & spy is back on the menu boys who held calls before close ?
Pton dying haha. Everyone knew this was going to happen
SQ went cliff diving but brought a bungee cord
Fuck PTON. Fuck BB.

BBBY. QC. NVDA. ZUCK, ELON, and AMZN
According to all these earnings my moves tomorrow are pain, regret, and self-loathing.
This earnings season has been a total bloodbath except for a few companies. If you miss estimates, your stock dumps 15-25%.
NET puts were not the play apparently lol FML
One dip everyone knows the rules
Hoping over to r/thetagang to find PTON put sellers 👀
Love me some F keep it up!
Thanks peloton for the tax right off
I think SQ fucked me.
You don't need the treadmill to lose weight when you can't afford food.
META is adding value every day and almost to $340… by the end of the month it may go back to $375.
I miss the times when people with actually good DD would post an analysis and it would hit the front page. Now it’s just autistic screaming and throwing crayons at the wall for “DD”
Peloton CEO: here is my report card dad.

Dad: WTF is this? You are grounded for the next 6 months and your allowance is cut by 25%.
I’m so confused. So now when a company reports good earnings the stock goes up? What is this shit?
Visual mod gonna go big game hunting tomorrow for all the apes who ban bet 300

Trading with you retards really skews my sense of money.  Someone at work was talking about how they know someone who won a $10k prize and everyone else was acting like that was a big deal while I was thinking about how my account has gained and lost more than $10k multiple times on idiotic calls throughout the year.

i think i got lucky selling my nvda calls at their peak today.
I'm getting straight FUCKED on earnings this week.  First -30% with VMEO then -30% with PTON and tomorrow will probably be -30% with DKNG. How do I hit the fucking reset button?
fuck, didn't realize PTON earnings were today. Was such an easy short after all of the other corona companies tanked.
PTON just wrecked me.
Cathie probably just sorts by high to low PE when looking to buy new stocks
Bull thoughts: Wages are increasing which will make it harder for small business to operate. Corporations are the strongest they've been and snowball effect suggests they will only get stronger. Eventually the only option a person will have if they want to turn their money into more money is stocks/internet money. So the american dream of 'start your own business' will be/is becoming forgotten. The new dream is to buy calls.

what if we went long on Chegg? Can you fax me a pistol so I can shoot off my dick and bleed to death?
> Chegg is a textbook rental company that was founded in 2005. It has lost over 90% of its value since then, and the stock price currently sits at $3.83 per share after dropping from around $15 during 2015-2016 when it had an IPO on NASDAQ under CHGG. The current market cap for Chegg is only about 200 million dollars, which means you could buy out all of their shares with less than 1 billion USD if you really wanted to get rid of them completely (which would be quite difficult).

NVDA running all the way through earnings…
$350 by earnings, product launch next week
When
I slept from 9 to 12 and now I can't fall asleep fuck
drink a bottle of gin
Looks like my nvda 11/12 320c is gunna be deep itm today. Woopie!
this nvda run is amazing i wonder what it settles back down to after earnings
So Ive been in on NVDA since $60 pre split and I listened to literally every single earnings call for the last 5 years - it has never been this pumped up before earnings and theres no way the numbers can justify this meltup even in the slightest. That said the AI keynote on the 9th could keep it pumping. The stock has changed its character. It used to be a hypergrowth stock with valuation ahead a few quarters. Now it seems to be turning into a fairy magic valuation type of stock like TSLA.
i told you motherfuckers get on nvda
TSLA, NVDA, NET, CROX, MARA and AMD have been pure fucking money trees for me, these cocksuckers are unstoppable
Remove tesla. That frog get cant stfu

The year is 2024. Yellowstone volcano erupted killing  tens of millions and destroying all cities in the PNW. Agriculture is decimated all up and down the breadbasket. 

Global warming accelerated faster than anticipated raising seal levels by 50 feet, displacing billions and destroying trillions of dollars worth of businesses and homes. 

An asteroid snuck by our scientists and landed in the heart of Paris reducing western Europe to ashes. 

I sit watching CNBC with eager anticipation. "Finally this has to be it" I think. The wallstreetbets live chat scrolls by at the bottom of the screen as Jim Cramer yells at me. A single tear rolls down my cheek as I stare in disbelief, "SPY hits ATH, SPY 1000". My puts expire worthless yet again as I read the words "BeArS R Fuk!".
That's because all of those disasters were already priced in.

I've been using these rules when trading and having good success when I stick to them:

1. limit yourself to just 1 or 2 high-confidence trades per day. You don't have to have a trade in progress at all times.
2. Set a price target for each trade and exit when you hit it or get close enough to be happy. 
3. Get out of trades that turn against you when your loss is about 15% of what you planned to make for the trade.
the only thing about that last one is it's hard to have perfect timing, and options can easily lose 15% in a day.
The rules were mostly for day trades with < 7dte options. I tend to use shares for swing trades so the % still works out there, but if I have calls a few months out I don't adhere to the 15% rule at the open as long as my thesis is unchanged.

And if my thesis is unchanged and I see a better entry, I'm usually buying the dip at that point.
that makes sense, i thought you might be talking about day trades.
This guy trades
I didn’t have a chance to get out of my peloton calls after 15% loss jajajajjaja 😹😹😹😹😹
What I got from this is consistently lose 15% by paperhanding and then regretting it in less than half an hour.
I have hardcore diamond hands. My biggest losses are from diamond handing when I should have exited a trade that wasn't working out.
There’s definitely a middle ground between diamond hands and paper hands that’s better than both by far. I agree diamond handing is how you really blow your shit up, but there’s also danger in being too skittish. Obviously the best thing is to have a good entry, but things often aren’t ideal.
I am yet to figure how to identify the #1, as in to know what a "high confidence trade" looks like.
This morning on the 5 min chart, at 11:25 SPX approached the 50-bar moving average on what was clearly a bullish day. I bought a SPX call at the money and sold it an hour later for 25% profit. This was my second (and last) trade of the day. This was a high-confidence trade, but if SPX had fallen below the 50-bar average I would have exited at a small loss because my thesis was that it would turn around at that point.
>SPX

Are you referring to Moving Average of 20 getting close to the MA(50) ? Sorry, a noob here.
[https://imgur.com/a/shou9yJ](https://imgur.com/a/shou9yJ) The MA(50) on the 5 min chart is the 250-min moving average.
Thanks for that! I'll try to match up your screenshot with what I am seeing on the live data.
Would you say, this is where AMD is now ?
yeah, there was a similar setup and recovery about 20 min before the close on AMD. That close to the close on a big day like AMD had, I'm more wary. profit taking can get pretty crazy.

If I had been watching AMD and looking for an entry I would have gone in around 11:55am. Here's why: On the 5-min chart: The MACD started to converge while the price was near the bottom of the 20-period bollinger bands. The RSI wasn't a strong signal at that point, but at least it had moved out of overbought territory.
Wish I would have done that 6 months ago. Words of wisdom.

PTON LOOOOOOOOOOOOL
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
\*starts peddling backwards\*
My pton call yolo just died. Oh my god
You yolo'd into a stationary bike?
And right into the stationary wall
🎻
Been fucked by PTON too many times. Congrats and fuck you to everyone winning.
We do it for you.
z and pton should team up, every house you buy comes with a garage full of bikes
SPY ATH afterhours, I fucking love the U.S

Puts on Hang Seng
🇺🇸
Who enjoyed those massive Nvda gains!?
if dkng tanks tomorrow too i can go 3/3 on getting my shit pushed in

good times
LostLifeSavingsOnGME having a full blown identity crisis over PTON earnings

Rename to LostLifeSavingsOnPTON ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Why
Today at open I wanted to buy nvda puts. This is the scenario where doing the opposite usually is better. 3k in calls later to 160% gain. We take those.
#Ban Bet Lost
---

/u/Zen0d0x (1/1) made a bet that SPY would go to 480.0 when it was 452.8 and it did not. They were automatically banned for two weeks.

To get out early they have to: **'I left a stupid message and now all I get is two week ban if I'm wrong.'**
FUCK. Knew I should’ve sold PTON at $115. Christ almighty.
RIP bro i would cut that lose before it goes lower
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
SQ's pre-conference call music choices are definitely whats dropping the stock price.  Is this fuking Sean Paul?
Nah, they could only afford Pauley Shawn
If you dropped 50k into DWAC 3 weeks ago then ran TSLA long then ran PTON short on leverage or FDs I guess you'd have a milly in 3 plays of the dice? 🤷
Your average wsb user has less than $25k… 😩
$25*
I’m average!! Wait
If you slowly put that 50k into tesla as you accumulated it you would probably also have a mill
Yes but we're hares not tortoises here baby 🐰🐢. Slow n steady doesn't get that serotonin pumping 🧠
Or just bought $5000 worth of NVDA $290 calls yesterday.
Add in nvidia
So if you had a Marty McFly to take you back to the future basically
Large cap low IV stocks are wild. TSM went up 3% today and my calls went up nearly 100%
Gotta get in there before IV spikes
I've kept an eye on the IV on them, only up 1 percent so far from 27% to 28%
Going to let my 200lb peloton bike tip over and crush my skull.
My square calls are getting fucked right in the ass come morning. Rip.
I laugh at the PTON commercials showing hot chicks. The only people who've I seen who have PTON bikes were wealthy buffalo Karen's collecting dust. They ain't buying another one and new trends start every day so not sure where they are going to get sales since it's not the hot new thing.
I know quite a few peloton owners and definitely aren't how you describe. My brother even lost 50lbs and now bikes and does marathons. My sister and I just bought the treadmill because we love our bikes.
LETS GO UBER
Great to see Cathie used all that money to make herself a new website
man. this is a dark age for bears. trapped in a whirling vortex of overpriced trash. I have long since stopped making any big bearish bets but it's the only way I ever make huge gains. I can never long this market with any conviction ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Last bearish bet I made I lost 11k the next day and Fidelity sent me a letter.
You are THE bear
Maybe that's why the market is unstoppable. Bears are scared to go in
200% market cap to GDP… for a very long time… I just don’t fucking know anymore.
Just use the money to mask your uneasiness with the situation. Do I believe in the current valuations? No. Do I invest in them? Yes. May as well take advantage of the irrationality and not be too upset once reality reappears.
PTON down more AH than the day their treadmill went maximum overdrive and devoured a child
I think there’s room for recovery when/if another round of shutdowns
I have a good feeling about my DKNG call tomorrow ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Im in on some of these too. Caught the dip today and have had a nice .05 cushion since lunch. LFG
Well see how it goes tomorrow
Mr Pton, my stocks don’t feel so good rn
shoulda went in on amd
I think Ford is just going to keep creeping up until it eventually hits infinity
I'm thinking more SPY LEAPS.  Dec 16, 2022 500c have done me well so far, so why not buy 50k more of them?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)
Based on how much all my contracts went up today, I could by almost 7 more contacts on the profits from today alone.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Fuck life
Same dude
Stay up g
someone lost a lot of monies today
FORD $20 tomorrow. Book it

I wouldn’t be surprised if a Rivian statement gives it an additional bump.
Ford just had someone get killed In Lima Ohio workplace stock might go down
I’m pissed I bought 10 25c 0.04 each for EOM and I wanted 1000 of em but I forgot to buy more… I’m legit sick about it
I really don't have anyone to talk to so I'm just venting but it sucks that your trying to move on and somewhat still want to be with and care for your cheating ass ex.
Go outside and look around. There’s talent everywhere
Move the fuck on my man, once a cheater always and that’s a fact. Find somebody new go on tinder bro and get some throw away pussy

Man, that feeling lingers for quite a while. You gotta keep yourself distracted elsewhere, hangout with people that make you happy, do things that make you happy. It’ll take a while to come out of their influence but once you do you’ll realize how shitty it was.
Is F the greatest boomer stock of all time, my at the time of purchase way otm leaps are about to be itm. With another 14 months to go.
Yes now wait till they grow 100% YoY next year when the supply chain is fixed.
They were. Then the d/c’d dividend. Now they reinstalled it. So maybe they are again.
Going to buy some leaps. It's been consistent.
Zillow dumping while AirBNB mooning.

Lesson learned: don't flip homes, rent their rooms out.
Zillow execs bought a bunch of shitty houses using the Offers program and are now renting those houses out for $1000/night on ABNB.

Genius.
If you’re willing to do the upkeep between guests yes Airbnb is financially smarter
I wish it was dumping but it’s only down 1%
NVDA going to the moon with Metaverse
Ford is my bitch right now. January leaps may be exercised by December.
My best performing asset in my market portfolio atm
I am genuinely happy for Ford gang, my homie bought Ford calls at the bottom of the Covid dip and he’s been banking big time.
I’ve got 9 leaps on Ford and it’s free money
Someone please stop me from yoloing those 320 NVDA calls 😭
To the moon bb. Can't stop won't stop
God dammit I’m in
I’ll never understand why people buy stock in companies like PTON
Just buy Redbox lol
Totally made sense at the time. You are a fool if you didn’t sell at the highs
26billion market cap on SPORTING equipment… Some 36% of americans are overweight, we don’t workout PTON worth like 10-20, if that.
Ok boys I want to see those PTON loss or gain porn tomorrow? I only grab some weekly puts
I’m going shopping for PTON tomorrow!
Might be good timing to sell a couple OTM puts.
I placed a put option for $71 for 11/05 can't wait to wake up with morning wood.
At what point does everyone wake up that Uber is a pile of shit?

They’re never going to be profitable without using wework math. 

I keep waiting for the turning point where all the growth brings in the money, they’re in every market now and still nothing.
We work math. Haha. These are our profits if every car was booked 120% of the time… lmfao.
First time SPY daily RSI has passed 70 (overbought) since April

Currently 75
What did it do after that?
Dropped $7 over the next 2 days

417 to 410
Also vxx rising over past couple days… good find
If SPY actually hits 500 eoy I’m faking my own kidnapping and telling my parents the ransom is to liquidate their retirement plan
It will surpass $500
Good I bought 12/31 500c for the glory
Imagine how I feel holding 12/16/22 500c
Absolute king shit right there
130 contracts at 4.48 average.
Those gonna print huge
Me tooo!!!
plot twist: it will go to 500 but everything exceot for TSLA will be red.
I'm definitely buying PTON puts at open as fast as possible.
too late maybe
Don’t, or buy the next meme stock after 100% gain too
Any chance F goes to $20 ?
God I hope not. Never in my life did I think selling F CCs would be risky.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
I forgot I had a sell set for 19.02 it sold today ughhh ok I'll take 600 but damnt
Gonna close my NET puts for a healthy loss then head up north for a wedding. Golf Friday, wedding Saturday. Gonna be great.
Hope SPY ends on a high note tomorrow
oh it will, Just like it has for the past week
It’s been on an absolute tear recently, I hope we can get to $500 by December
That’s excatly what’s going to happen, and when that happens i’m going to have so much fucking money from my 12/31 500 calls
We’ll see. I hope you’re right but no one really knows. SPY could swing $30 in either direction tomorrow
exactly, after this eventful week something is going to happen
QQQ just touched the trend line of resistance where it’s reliably sold off every time over the last 14 months
Bet you it will go up just because you made this comment
It would make me feel like a genius to sit here on my cash and watch TQQQ burn tomorrow after my early exit when I got a little itchy on the stop loss this morning.  

Otherwise I'm gonna watch it rise more and wonder how the hell to convince myself to get back in.
Fuck my luck. I bought $PINS at a price that I won't name, as a day trade, and been stuck in it since.
From day trader to bag holder :(
:'(
Been there done that, id like to say it gets easier but it really doesn’t 😥
You’re a long term investor now
Me with pltr.
if NVDA climbs to 310 then AMD should climb to 155
PTON earnings so bad it’s dragging down affirm with it lol
No it’s SQ dragging it down
I must say this year Shorts really get fuk hard.
what other corona/lockdown companies have earnings coming up? Guaranteed that they tank like PTON
Did Peleton even sell a treadmill last quarter?
> The company has not disclosed its financial results for the last quarter.
You need to rest buddy
F calls?
Kinda late to the party breh
You’re just now waking up to this?
I am, what’s the move?
the move was load up last wednesday my guy
Buy two weeks ago and sell today
Phew. I mean, I’m not saying it won’t keep running, it may. But it already ran too much for me to buy in here. I would wait for the next pullback.
We hoping it passes 20 tomorrow morning 😬😬😬
calls first thing in the morning, or is it too late
I don’t know. Hit 19.60 in AH. 

I bought 11/5 20 contracts earlier in the day.
It’s your call
Wow just saw that PTON got Fucking punished. Daaaaaaaaaaamn
Covid Stonks are dead money.
Showing us that it really does suck to suck
SPY 469 EOW.
Higher
HIGHER, THE KING OF THE SKY
If you bought Peleton thinking it wasn't going to be just a passing fad.... I got a video rental store called Blockbuster... should be huuuuge
I bought on the dump, and it kept dumping :(
Oooof size to the max
Tell your wife or your girl that it’s time to go out to the dumpster!
Ford going into the 20’s, PTON going into the 50’s
Many thanks to the brother /u/Hour_Amphibian1844 due to whom I bought 10k of PTON $90p
confuckulations
Hope you can buy 1000 lambos!!!

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/HMS_Entropy (0/1) made a bet that VXX would go to 24.5 when it was 21.63 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
how come my friend cant take profits, when she trades someone's annual salary for the year in the first 15 minutes of a trading day??? IS SHE A RETARD????????
She should be on this sub.
The money isn’t for buying anything, it’s just to set the stakes high enough that winning feels like something.
FUCK, she must be autistic like me then...

Yes, bullish
Austin, TX is seriously one of those cities where you can party every day because it’s always there and really lose track of your priorities and career
I've spent half of my time banging hookers and doing blow, the other half I wasted
Yes, I’m currently doing that.
Are you talking about Downtown Austin 6th street? Kinda run down now.
> I am talking about Downtown Austin 6th street. It is a little run down now, but it was once the center of American culture and music.
There’s so much more there’s West 6th, Rainey, clubs at the Domain. South Congress has a party every first Thursday and bars are actually packed on weekdays now as if nobody works the next day plus add all the live music and happy hours and beautiful women from everywhere. Huge distraction
Isn’t it somewhat annoying that the bars are packed? Like getting a seat and getting served wise.

🤭😂
Smh
so you’re trying to get banned
I have PTON puts so being greedy
Dude this is instant banning. Need a break, buddy?
It's Thanksgiving week. Time off time. If it hits I'm rich, if not then break
Fair enough. If this happens tho, that’s complete destruction of the company. That would hertz
I have puts so not for me 🤣
Wow. I hope it continues to fall for your sake. Have a good night m8
Wow

305c 6/17
AMD running to 140 tomorrow
$2.5 isn’t exactly a “run” for amd
Worth a couple 0dte calls at open.
What would your play be here?
For anyone who uses RSI to trade, here's a tip: When RSI is overbought, it doesn't mean to start shorting, it means demand is high so you actually go long. 

I know it seems counter intuitive but we're in a clown market where bears have no power and the tiniest dip is bought up. Go with the crowd. Stonks only go up.
In the metaverse how will I be able to show my alpha masculinity over the lesser beta males?? I’m just worried these throw back males might have a chance and take my higher valued females 😤

dont worry man im sure theyll add an option so you can pay to not have a micropenis there at least
You maybe a beta after all
It's too bad pton stock is a steaming pile of garbage. That IV would be tasty to sell puts on

God damn Elon is worth 306.5 billion now wtf

Man the whole barstool gang is sucking portnoy off behind the Wendy’s on Hollywood blvd … I’ve been waiting here 3 hours now … still haven’t had any bear slob on my knob
I love how for the past 4 quarters nobody was like “prepare for IV crush” but now that tickers are dropping 30% left and right everyone’s like “tHeY pRiCeD iN 2oO Iv”
Damn you on top of it. Gold ⭐️
We need hypersonic jets so bad. I would make so many bad decisions if I could get to Vegas in 1 hour.
Boom
With airport security, boarding, take off, landing, you’re probably looking at 3 hours for a 1 hour flight
Even better.  What if I told you there is a company who wants to build massive tunnels underground where there is no waiting on air traffic control?  In a vacuum and using maglev, you could reach supersonic speeds without the regulatory control of noise pollution.  It could be worth billions, no, TRILLIONS!
Popped a melly I’m sleeping 💤
Jesus fuck me why didn’t I go balls deep on 11/19 475c three weeks ago
Isn’t too late for 12/10 12/31 500 calls
Cause you don’t know the future.
You still can
If Mike White didn’t go down Jets would be winning and you can’t change my mind.
Puts on Zach Wilson.
I was supposed to workout. I started drinking instead. Probably still going to do it. Beats preworkout by a country mile.

man whatever happened to   
###what are your moves tomorrow  

FB 11/5 340c - looks poised to fucking rocket and blow the 340 resistance to 350  

HOOD 1/21 35c - cheap ass premium for an ITM play, when the casino goes on full blast, they benefit  

BABA 11/12 180c - straight degenerate gambling on 11/11 singles day sale, I anticipate a market run up to that day which is why I entered this week at a low 😉
I’m glad I’m not the only one who bought hood 35calls

Also Disney calls were good price too, picked some up when it was low 169. 
Yeah I don’t fuck baba anymore. Got burned too many times
When no one answers their margin calls at the first real dump, they really gonna go on blast.

Sounds like a name they came up with in a couple weeks in a panicked attempt to rebrand. Oh wait…
Just like squaw valley ski resort becoming Palisades.  Sounds like a 10 year old thought of it
We did it, we found a way to never have a bear market ever again. Bers cannot exist in this world we created without total humiliation. It’s awesome
I think that fucking earnings calendar is wrong.  $COIN earnings are on 11/9.  Damn you WSB!
Well fork me and call is salad, I’ve been bamboozalled
11/9 is Tuesday but yes next week not tomorrow
Trading options and not being able to use a calendar.  Is it a surprise that I'm here?
I can’t get over how retarded Apes sound
You know, that’s how pretty much everyone sounds when they are caught up in confirmation bias. If you don’t have some piece of evidence that, If found, would constitute a fail condition, you probably sound exactly the same. It’s very easy to become like them.
Yes, but you also have to take a step back and look at the GME situation. It was trading at like $4 a year ago and is now above $200… that’s for real, that’s not a conspiracy or confirmation bias. It’s also really fuckin weird, and if anything totally bizarre were to happen, it would happen to a stock putting up those kind of numbers
It was definitely over shorted. Hedgefunds have had plenty of time to slowly unwind their short position. I don’t know for certain that they have, but it definitely could have been done. The problem is the consistent shifting of the goal posts. There is no fail state, there nothing to say that it’s definitely over. Even if it’s true, it’s still confirmation bias. Just because something is logically fallacious doesn’t mean that it’s false, it just means that the reasoning isn’t sound, which makes you sound absolutely fucking crazy.
Yeah I hear ya. All the same, I think there is definitely a chance GME sees a real short squeeze, and when people look back at the price action over this year, it will become very clear that it was indeed a bizarre, unique situation the whole time, but was poo-poo’d because of the apes and there confirmation bias subreddits. I think a lot of people are missing the forest for the trees with the GME situation
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Another week gone by, another set of puts sold to bears expiring at -100%. Theta Gang in a Bull Market is like fishing with dynamite.
it was a killer week for theta gang. tsla was white hot.
Also a great week for the fd degens
I think about the lady who broke her leg stomping on grapes and going “ohh eughw eughw eughw” all the time. I remember breaking my leg and the way the shock hit my brain and It probably made me make a very similar noise. Adrenaline must do something to your memory.
It's actually fundamental to memory. Awhile back I remember researchers doing experiments where they gave people adrenaline blockers and had them try to relive traumatic experiences. It reduced their PTSD significantly. 

Adrenaline tells you how important an event or memory should be and PTSD sufferers keep experiencing symptoms because of how important the body categorized the experience. 

I can vividly picture the lady stomping on the grapes too.
Brains are weird little contraptions, I’ll tell you hwhat.
Once you deaden all the nerves in your legs, you only feel life threatening injuries for better or worse 

*walks off a broken ankle*
Seems like a super power
A super power would be not being injured if you can't feel the pain
I’m just saying words man, making these clock ticks pass into the realm of non-existence.
But you didn’t get to enjoy the feeling of the grapes between your toes as your leg broke, and I bet you’ll always regret that and think about what could have been. Keep your chin up.
I think what I’ll mostly think about is girls mouths.
Holy shot that’s old. It took me a second to pull it up in my brain. I think I might go watch it now.
Adrenaline makes you feel less pain in the short-term
Definitely, but I think it must also do something to make memories remain clearer for longer. It happened when I was like 9, and I don’t remember almost anything else from being 9 years old.
Bold theory you’ve got there champ
I am a champion.
Shit I shattered my collarbone and got right back on my mtn bike lol
You must be a real tough cookie with a long history, breaking little hearts like the one in me.

Just wondering if anyone in here is actually smart, where did you all go to college?
> I went to Harvard.
I work in cyber security. I know so many people with college degrees in other fields that are absolute morons.
Went to a California State University. Not to be confused with the University of California, which is all the elite shit like Berkley and Davis. Wasn't remotely smart enough for that
You just haven't discovered your gift yet. College doesn't necessarily measure your smartness. Keep looking and one day you'll find your gift that you can offer to the world.
Thats what poor people tell themselves ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
College isn't for everyone. I graduated with a college degree, but I don't feel like it's useful to me to get to where I want to go. Discover your gift/passion and you won't have to work a day in your life.

Got a tough presentation on a topic I don’t know much about to a customer tomorrow, stressing over 9-5 blows man 😞
Dude everything is predetermined. Just chill,  also offer your finger for them to smell.
This cannot fail
Speak confidently, don't pretend to know everything, focus on your key messaging and know exactly what you want the client to take away from the session. If that doesn't go well, shit your pants and pretend to be steamboat willy, no one will remember your botched pitch.
You got this fam. Just get a goodnight sleep. It makes everything better.
News outlets: Hey everyone, we need a new hype buzzword to throw around now that "the cloud" and "the blockchain" and "the fully autonomous robotaxi network" are plateauing in interest.

Enter... **"THE METAVERSE!"**

Oooooooooooh!  Ahhhhhhhh!
Imagine the internet, but now it’s called metaverse
The sky was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel
It's a new paradigm
Open ze marketz

Du
Good night DKNG gang. Hope to see y’all on the moon tomorrow
Why Cathie buying 1 million shares of Skillz???
God told her to
Puts time
My TQQQ call printed today to end ITM. Just got it at open. I'll probably sell mid morning tomorrow. 20% in a day not bad.
Playing options on a leveraged product just means you are paying more premium with worse volume and fills than the underlying index. QQQ calls for a 1% move payout just the same as TQQQ calls for a 3% move. Look at the difference in Implied Volatility. You’ll have less IV crush on the less volatile product, especially when you hold over night
Last 2 girls I've dated left me to focus on school or because ex came back.

I have begun to realize I may have been lied to
on one hand, women will almost always go back to their exes. i should have dated more women in high school, so I could be the ex to whom they go back 

on the other hand, a little self-improvement might go a long way. take a good honest look at yourself (or ask the biggest asshole you know to tell you) and figure out why women prefer their ex over you. obviously some things you can't control, but I know a rich guy who was pretty cool and carefree, but he couldn't keep a woman around because he would grind his teeth in his sleep (and snore way too loudly when he drank, which was often). Women would rather be with their loser weed-dealing ex-boyfriends than to share a bed with a man where they don't get any sleep (but not in the fun way). 

point is, probably isn't your fault because it's happened to every man at one point in his life or another, but that's no reason not to work on yourself. 

me, I've got catastrophic erectile dysfunction, a small penis and I'm too ugly to live. I'm still working on overcoming those, it's a process
They definitely not in school I know that for a fact
That sucks! I hope you're feeling ok.
11 minutes until I find out how retarded I am (most likely it's somewhere between "a lot" and "very")
How long did it take for you to figure out square only went in circle with enough force?
as soon as I watched that youtube video proving it, of course

i have no upper body strength so I had assumed that was the case but I was unable to prove it

Probably their product with the best margin
I think they use butter
Margarine calls
*"Always has been."* 👩‍🚀🔫👨‍🚀
It better be overpriced like the movie popcorn
Stock has record-breaking 17% rise in a day.

WSB: What an opportunity to buy the top! Time to go ALL IN.
I say: what an opportunity to buy puts

Then the stock has 5 more back to back record breaking rises
I had fun selling NVDA covered calls to you guys today at the top
Tomorrow I expect PTON announce they are buying 10000 Tesla

Tesla increasing prices again. Bullish as fuck. Take note peloton 🤡
Analysts can’t keep up and are taking too long to buy in on their pricing convictions.
wow, it's like every two weeks now with the increases
Lmaoo peloton offering inflight exercise classes on delta flights should’ve been a hint to buy puts

**PTON LMFAO**
well, fucking slaughtered by PTON. RKT looking good so far. hopefully DKNG don't fuck me too tomorrow morning
Pton absolutely buttfucking me
Time for new flair
Losing 3rd Mortgage on PTON
Held sq calls through earnings. Can’t tell if rope yet.
Better buy now before it's out of stock
Definitely rope
Paperhanded a bunch of calls/ shares this week. Missed like $20k with AMD alone🤡
Clown life let’s go🤡
Damn looks like PTON puts was the play…
Holy shit PTON puts were the play today.
Don’t they get IV crushed during earnings
Yeah but it moved significantly more than expected, so you’d still make an amazing amount.
NET put holders…rip
u/Hour_Amphibian1844 bro I love you
❤️
Simp
how do i turn 100k into 100 dollars?
Buy PTON calls tomorrow
U got cash app
PTON calls
Buy Zillow
Imagine cutting prices on your products and still not making money

PTON bulls 🤡🤡🤡🤡
I was indeed, wrong, again.
I lol’d
I wonder if Cathie Wood bought PTON recently.
She's been selling, but her cost average is $107.63
Did Pton make me a bag holder…
Honestly, it should have made you a loser, so you can get out and make your money win again. Don't hold these bags
Bags are heavy…
Shoulda just held ford
Welcome to the club
I think the market just went from easy to medium in difficulty.
NVDA was like a slowww moving train that was continuously spilling money out of the train cars.  I nabbed only a couple Hundo but that was one of the coolest train rides this year
AMD is on the same tracks tbh
Just even slower
I bought a 260c 1/21/22 and made 4.5 grand. I was on a high today
That’s amazing. Nice work
I’m glad I sold NET
i'm not glad i sold. then again i sold in february 2020 for $18
That’s rough buddy 😧
No reason everyone in here shouldn’t have played Puts on PTON. One of the guys in here posted great DD and it was no brainer for me! If you see this thank you bro ! 💰
I sold mine for 10 percent before close cuz I want sure how IV crush would play out
I think Cathie bought PTON today
I bought long dated PTON puts when it was at $100 and fuckin paper handed them god dammit
Uber earnings at 5, calls or puts i hope you make it
Earning's CALL
I’m on the call side but AH has me thinking they know something I don’t lol. Hope it’s bear trap
Buy PayPal.
I'm just waiting for ER lol
Fuck you SQ and ROKU. I'll just stay away from earnings
You dont know how to play
PTON  🏃‍♀️ bagholders. Where you at?
Here
Come on RKT, do something
Go to 40 again!!
How bad did PTON miss earnings?
Very bad. But the worst part is that they're lowering theit guidance for the next full year. RIP PTON.
Horribly
sq missing by 2 cents is rly enough to drop 3%, seems like overreaction. still in longterm
Revenue missed big
SQ ain't going anywhere. Just hold.
PTON overvalued by 3x still 👀
No
Pton u suck
It knows lol
The Becky ETF getting crushed today. Puts on white women.
$F should be really close to hitting just over $20 EOD tomorrow.  Most of the resistance has been gone sine 10/28/2021. Day traders and robots always hit around 11:00 AM to drive the price down. Slow nice recovery after lunch for the last week.

With Rivian IPO next week should get another dollar or two next week. Changing my $20 EOY to $23. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)
RKT is the reason i won't pay a lot of taxes this year!
F
So stock beats earnings, drills. Stock doesn't beat earnings, drills. Lol. I can't pick shit right.
ETSY drilled a bit and then ripped 15%. Which stock?
RKT
The earnings themselves don't really matter as much as people think. What matters more is how people are playing the float and options. Even then, it's a crapshoot.
Because it is priced in
I predict we rip again tomorrow, LFG bois
So are $PINS earnings good or bad?
Better than expected plus the stock was down too much so it can finally start to recover
Apparently good because even though their user base didn’t grow they beat revenue by a surprising amount and beat EPS so basically my puts are fucked 🥲
Fuck I knew I should’ve bought PTON puts
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)
Everything is so pricy right now that earnings misses are just massacring prices. Scary time to be in the market imo.
My VIX calls are ready.

Made money on PTON, lost on PINS, works out right?
serves you right for shorting $PINS.
after losing half my portfolio last week I’ve had a hell of a comeback. got back up to where I was today and made some nice gains too
How?
tsla, fb, amd, nvda, and msft calls
Explain yourself you foot fetish having nerd
Fuck i think my uber call is going to print tomorrow
What call did you get
50c for next week
Sexy
enjoy IV crush
The IV on calls today was low. I bought min right around the 40 level
Well my PTON leap is FUCKED
I feel you. Sold my ATVI leap yesterday for a 50% loss
Thanks for the loss flex I’m taking a -900 loss over here for you my man!
$sq 🥲
The last time PTON stock was at 64, was in August 2020. 

Not that long ago, actually. 

Just 15 months ago.
PTON was just a tax write off play
😩😩😩😂😂
Good play if your tax rate is 100%.
Is Cathie gonna load up on PTON? 🤔

She loves buying these crap stocks
Maybe the Beer in St. Lucia
I wish I knew what this meant
Piton beer Better than the stationary bike!
UBER accidently made money this quarter.  Investors are displeased
Now fully convinced this shit just going up forever
That's how they get you
True
Buy dips. Keep buying dips.
But it's hard when it just keep going up lol
Mmm, can't wait to see some the bag holder porn tomorrow. Stupidly overvalued EXERCISE BIKE MAKER. Still a 26b (edit: 18b) company. That makes a fucking EXERCISE BIKE.
>can't wait to see some the bag holder porn tomorrow. Stupidly overvalued EXERCISE BIKE MAKER. Still a 26b company. That

yeah but it has an ipad on it
How much money do I have to make before I start selling trading courses on Instagram
You’re so yolked
It helps your popularity when you have loss porns to show

Big audience for that
don’t worry, PTON is still overvalued
If Biden doesn’t keep JPow as head of the Fed I’m storming the capitol. Who’s with me?
Bro you can’t joke about shit like that anymore. Snowflakes actually did it this year
Lmao ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)

Same. Better yet I had some PTON today too, let's hope I'm 2/2
Really hope there's a Chad over at Vanguard who loaded NVDA in my retirement ETF
Tesla do the thing! You know you want to!
How we feeling about NVDA tomorrow??
Just went balls deep on 370 calls. Hoping for the best.
You can buy calls AH?
i think there will be a pullback. not sure how big. Tesla did the same thing. huge bull run, curve got steeper and steeper, then one crazy day where it went apeshit, then down.
like shit, like im about to lose a lot of fuckin money on calls i held
Right now my winners are way way ahead of my losers, but goddamn I feel a little sick knowing I'm gonna take it on the chin tomorrow with SQ big bigly.
FB recovered in a day, you’ll be alright
SQ will recover. Shit like peloton tho I don’t think so at least not for a hot minute
Hope so, thanks!
cathie woods bought pton before close
Just trying to erase any gains for the year.
If true she’s using these couple shit plays to cover up for an insider trading double up.

Or she’s no less retarded than us.
hahah i don't think its true just seems like something she'd do
No way lol
Did she really?
no I'm pretty sure I remember seeing her sell PTON in an e-mail this week--- maybe it was last night
Peloton is worth $20
I’d pay 19.50 but no more
Plus shipping and handling
Who even bought PTON in the first place?
I know a lot of people. I’d rather just have a rowing erg myself.
I mean the stock lol. I remember looking at it last year and wondering who bought it at those levels lol
Oh, yeah I don't know anyone that retarded
Lol
Just updated my Nvidia GeForce driver and got a notification saying G-Sync is enabled on my device which I can only assume means "Gains Sync". Feeling super bullish now.

AFRM getting fukt from SQ

Maybe money will flow into actual undervalued names like FB
From PTON.

PTON is a major source of their BNPL revenue.
I thought they diversified from them which what drive their stock price up so much a few weeks ago
They did but PTON is still a major contributor to their revenue.

How low you think it'll go? I have multiple 75p, excited for this
I have 50 85p.  Excitement doesn’t even begin to cover it.  I want to see it open at 50.
Damn. I only have 3 75p, and 5 65p. And thats a quarter of my port lol
Mother fucking PTON puts, too busy with TSLA NVDA AMD among others.

Oh, my plans involve a 30 of miller lite, a couple of bad option calls and a jar of peanut butter and the dog after the kids go to bed. Puts on my NVDA earnings.
**Cathie** bought 1.1 million shares of **SKLZ** and 300K shares of **ROKU**
Probably gonna sell it for a loss tomorrow like what she did with Zillow lol
And Pton and Zillow she is the best top buyer
DKNG gang we are not dead yet!  But hope all yalls calls dont expire tomorrow
Regardless of what happens this is the last time i trade this stock
Your dead. The big players that have been running sports books for decades all have released their own apps, with book makers who know how to make a profit. RIP
Doodoo stock. Doesn’t make any money. Best chance that thing has is getting bought out.
What would you do if Cathie Woods was your mom and she kept embarassing you by buying the top and your finance friends at school keep bullying you
Probably sell all her positions and buy apple puts on earnings. GUHTHIE WOODS

What can Robinhood or Fidelity even do if you get margin called? Do people go to court over this shit?
Yes.

Do you think they just laugh it off?
I honestly just thought they would close the user's account and blacklist them forever. Never heard of anyone getting sued or arrested for having 5k margin call.
5k probably just fucks up your credit and/or maybe wage garnishments or things of that nature

I got 6 business days for PTON to create a stationary bike that burns 1000 calories every rotation
Careful, a stationary bike with a flamethrower to ignite the rider's excess fat deposits is technically feasible
Maybe the Ford 20c 11/5's I picked up cheap early today will actually be ITM at this rate..
If DIS can manage to not tank immediately after open tomorrow, that would be great.

Have you held a 11/5 expiry over the last few days? I got a similar email once even though I had sold a 1DTE option during the day. Their system seems to be delayed.
Yes I sold some this morning 11/05 I was thinking it didn’t go through when I saw the email and about shit my pants
I lost everything I gained over the last 6 months in 2 days 🤦🏻‍♂️

It’s weird to me that Ford hasn’t broke $20 looking at other car stocks
They need to rebrand to Fesla, would hit 1T in a few years

Call me a fucking retard but it reeks of VW to me 🚀
What you mean?
From back in March?
Will have to look at chart
Just looked. Oh fuck. I forgot about that run up
One thing that makes me nervous about Ford is looking at the strike going on at Deere the UAW could really fuck things up.
That's why they built the electric plant in Tennessee

One of the most prude girls I know always wears strappy shit around her neck and chest.  Very misleading.
In college I drunkenly asked a girl at a party if she wanted to go back to my place and get it on.  She said yes.  She sucked on my fingers all the way home.  When we got hot & heavy in the bedroom she wouldn’t take off her jeans and told me she was a virgin.  She was totally soaked through said jeans but wouldn’t even let me pet the kitty.  “I’m sorry I’m a tease” she said.  That’s ok sweetheart, I respect you.  At least you have nice titties.  Three weeks later we ran into each other on campus and she asked when we were going to hook up and make out again.  I had recently just started banging an ex girlfriend and honestly contemplated my chances, but awkwardly changed the subject because I’m typically an awkward dude.  I often reflect on that moment and wonder if she, as a senior getting ready to graduate, was realizing she needed to lose it before going out in the real world or if she just naively thought I wanted to play with her titties and rub her denim-covered crotch again.  I’ll never know, but I sincerely hope she found a man (or woman) who is making her happy in the bedroom.
I had the privilege of working with old dudes while in high school who told me the ways of the world.  The key note of this wealth of knowledge was that you will regret any consensual interactions you decline, no matter the circumstance.  Secondly, marry for money, because after a few decades it’s all one in the same.
def not a prude behind closed doors
Been there.  I was expecting a swing and stained sheets not a friends poster and cat toys.
Oh shit. Cat toys and friends poster?! 

Dude. she absolutely loves to be tied up and choked
Maybe I should set her up with Paper Hands Portnoy.  We just didn’t click.

Look at one year chart first
5 days and 1 month
I still have one of the worst exits this week. Sold 20x NVDA $265 weeklies yesterday at close. It hurts. Moved everything to TSLA 11/12 $1200.
Ouch! You’re okay pal ?
Not until TSLA hits $1300
You could have been up like …8000% on those calls today! Wow, you’re a strong individual my man, way stronger than me
I hope SPACs get another run soon. That was a nice time

Waiting for dip to put £40k into TSLA shares but she isn't playing ball
WTF NVDA! I should have bought those 0DTE calls at close
**NVDA imma load up on 320c calls 🥵 at open**
Grabbed some 340 nvda calls at 3:58 yesterday.
What expiration?
Almost certainly today and otm
Probably today, this IS wsb.
Lol I forgot this was wsb, home of the retards !
Watching everybody make money while i sit bagholding Gyna :[
Everyone keeps making these huge gains and I just end truly tilt Airbnb pray from this win bro pray it holds
amd is getting pulled along nicely by nvda pump. 💰 fuck you bears.
$TSLA calls going to print tomorrow 🤑
man i hope so overpaid for a 1250c at close, let’s gooo
1235C here. Market closed at 17% down (even though I bought on a fucking dip) which breaks my rule to sell at 15% stop loss AND never hold less than 14DTE overnight...

I broke one rule because of the other. That makes it OK right?
ofc, also rule 3: rules don’t apply to Tesla
Preach. 

It definitely seems either stalled out or changed in some way this last week.

I'm hoping NVDA money comes back to TSLA tonight and tomorrow AM. 

I know money was being funneled to NVDA today.
Bought NVDA at $312
Please wear this helmet for our safety, bless you child.
312 will be considered smart in 2 weeks
G I sure hope so I put all my Tesla profits in there
LFGGG
My account hit six figures for the first time this week and its already at €106k. Its hard to explain but it feels very  different from being in the high five figure area, it feels like Ive made it. From here the fairy magic of compound interest should do the rest. In my country, not even 5% of people own individual stocks. How can anyone be this fucking stupid? Either you build capital or you're a slave for life. AI will steal most of these peasant's jobs and they will be given just enough to keep the economy running. How many brain cells does it take to realize what Marx already told them ages ago anyway?
congratulations, you have escaped the matrix.
7 is the true escape.
6 is good enough for us retards, 7+ is the dream
congrats mang, one solid YOLO away from 7 figures
That's awesome and I'm happy for you, just don't get cocky, or whatever you brits say... toffee nosed?

Anyone remember that time we had huge number of unemployed, a shit ton of job openings and a retard trying to get 10-25% of the workforce fired? 

Btw, jobs report tommorow.
Those jobs openings are for shit jobs. 4 million workers said fuck it and left the workforce. 

We’re headed for stagflation. These people who quit aren’t going to spend money. Service and Sharing economy! The slaves aren’t coming back.
I thought betting on Becky stocks was safe. Stop the count!!!
And $SQ just fucked my PayPal calls
RKT 19c gonna print tomorrow baybbeee
upset that I sold ahead of close, but profit is profit
Anyone else plan on buying PTON puts at close and totally forgot?
SQ giving me a heart attack
The beheading of peloton. Holy shit!
PTON implied move for 1dte is like 10% so anyone that bought any puts are now swimming in $$$$$

Ugh forgot to get peloton puts…..i knew i was supposed to do something today…..
Well thankfully I have way more ABNB than PTON, what a reversal!
hey sq if u could go up that would be very cash money of you
with my PTON puts, tomorrow is gonna be one of those days where i’m taking my profits by 9:45 and will be back on monday
All these stocks down and SPY just chugging uphill
Imagine slashing the price of your products and people still don’t wanna buy. 

#BIG OOF PTON CHIEF 😬
OK which one of you sold 500 PTON 11/19 83P, 84P, and 85P about 15 minutes before close today for $300K in premium? This is now a $1 million loss. Please post the loss porn tomorrow.
pton puts tho
75p printing tomorrow

/u/bruceyj (1/1) made a bet that PTON would go to 80.0 when it was 90.2 and it did, congrats autist.
I can't predict the big movers like some of you fucks can. I'm just loading up on otm SPY long calls because I'm a gayboi and practice safe stonks sex. Teach me your ways, retards.
Just learn how to fucking read
To be honest I look for repeated mention of names that people are screaming about, but on any given day people are pulling for so many different stocks. It seems like only a handful of them actually pay off.
I suspect a lot of it is survivor bias, which doesn't help you much.
PTON. I’m getting my exercise by holding these heavy bags
I only had 7 shares of PTON and I'm still feeling that earnings lmao
NET rollercoaster 🎢
PTON and MRNA behind the Wendy’s S’ing D if anyone needs them.
Net is back below $200, the world is safe
Its back up. Danger threat level: to the moon.

Edit: Spoke too soon. Damn stock is bouncing around like a pinball.
Well, looks like my sq calls are kill.
Pton dumping. Becky's must be running out of money.
I always thought Peloton was a shit company even a few years ago when they got sued for using unlicensed music in their workout videos. Lol
Zillow should turn all their unsold homes into Airbnb's
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Nah
Puts were once again the wrong play 🤡
Not for pton lol
Someone want to buy me some rope? Can’t afford my own after that SQ earnings miss.
> I'm not buying you anything. You got your head up your ass if you think SQ is going down that much
Lol appreciate the optimism, VM.
A couple people got killed making PTON market orders after hours
I saw that and made me sweat on my puts
Market orders after hours, huh?
You gotta know the secret knock
I swear once I get back to 50k and beyond maybe 100k I’m buying leaps on Tesla spy and Microsoft and I’m chilling the fuck out
ITM or OTM leaps?
ITM gonna be more expensive but otm makes for more money if it actually hits decisions prob gonna end up being otm since that what I do anyways with 1dte calls
depends on what you mean by leaps...1 year? 1.5 years? longer. Yes more expensive ITM or lower poor man's covered call. OTM could make a lot or lose it all depending on how far out date/price though.

Note: MSFT collects dividends if you buy/hold shares.
Otm is always a gamble but prob a year out I think I would take that chance on the stocks I mentioned. Tesla has showed time and time again that it will deliver even if you have otm calls lol especially if they do another stock split
Holy shit, whoever said PTON and NET  puts, I THANK YOU. I only did 2 PTON 75p, (expiring tomorrow of course) but that 300$ boutta be 1000

I'm cumming
Looks like current PTON bagholders just became long-term long-term bagholders
Very very long term if covid fades away
buying amd calls
which ones you looking at
I’m thinking about some slightly otm expiring in December. u?
Just get xlnx lower IV and undervalued compared to the deal
I’ll check it out
Oh fuck all these pton comments bring in the TSLA bois we know pton is shit
$50 is a reasonable open for Peloton tomorrow that everyone can agree on
I think $0.01 is more like it
Peloton reminds us how quickly your fortune can change
PTON hates babies, vaccines, and money
How the fuck has NKLA not been delisted
Somebody bought it at $62.  hahahahahaha.
Will probably run tommorow too. 🤡 market
My Z puts and my TSLA calls are gunna be fucken tomorrow I can feel it in my bones
Z needs to hit $65 at least.
Nah fuck Z anyone who bought is retarded did u not see the news they got plenty more downside imo
I would gladly take lower than $65 too.
I need ateast 62..
I was going to buy a Peloton bike with my gains but it looks like I’m just going to stay fat for now

Can't believe I actually bought NVDA at the top...this market got me thinking a 16% rip isn't enough
same, I kept thinking it was going to fly like Tesla did last week and dumped too much in
RKT you're a bitch
Earnings were great though, makes no sense.
Square miss. 😂😂😂
I don't like Jack Dorsey. Everything he leads seems to suffer.
Damn, almost bought calls today—always inverse your instinct
PTON has me shidding and farding. Puts on being healthy.
I’m gonna go get t bell and get those cinnamon balls that bust warm creamy white liquid in your mouth. That’s how I describe them over the drive through speaker
Another day of chef Elon cooking the books!
PTON just erased a week of my NVDA gains
Pour one out for all the PTON bagholders, *eh em* \*clears throar\*, I mean shareholders
I just opened and funded a roth yesterday and it's already outperformed my FD account
Wait until you start doing FDs inside of your Roth
I considered it, but the interface is so shit I don't think I could do it
$PENN tomorrow for the rebound?
I have 11/26 $65c. Cost basis is $1.73
Did you buy right before close?
About an hour before. It shot up 50%, but then went back to $1.73 at close.

Lowest of the day was $1.25, highest was about $6.90.

So I think I got a pretty good price
Yeah i bought some long dated calls but IV will drop if it doesnt move tomorrow

There is.   And TSLA roared from 800 to 1200 in just one week.
Dude. I’m being facetious. I know there was a huge purchase. But then Elon tweeted there wasnt a deal (probably so all of us actual retail customers who are waiting 12-18 months for my model Z plaid aren’t pissed about a dumb bankrupt company coming in and delaying our orders).

SOFI announced redemption of warrants. Can someone explain to a retard what that means. 

Thx
Warrants are calls for boomers. Sorry, I’m also a retard.
So you’re saying boomers are fucking me right now?
> I'm saying poor people are fucking me right now.
Generally when SPAC warrants are redeemed you pay an 11.5/warrant strike to convert them to shares. Your broker may also charge a fee…I think I paid 30 to have TDA convert mine for STEM. You also have a set time period to either convert or sell the warrants. All this should be in their S1 I believe.

Cathie selling off some PLTR before earnings is giving me a bad feeling...
Inverse Cathie, that’s how you make tendies.
Lol so how did that work for peloton? She sold before earnings
Pandemic over, who needs a Peloton? Even the most retarded kid on the short bus could tell you that.
She barely sold off anything? It literally means nothing
Wow that 20k PTON short DD … gonna make out big
3k > 40k sup fresh its our turn baby
Take 20k, and save it. Play with 10k and don't be retarded with the other 10k.

Do this and you'll end up actually being a millionaire unlike most retards here who will bet that 40k and end up at $20.
Yep i only have like 5k in options 10k in shares chilling man tsla brought me to the moon i aint going down wit the ship
Plays?
My move tommorow is to wake up with a replenished account off a knockout dkng earnings report. On the other hand, if earnings is a miss, there is always the dumpster behind Carls Jr.
The price action today shows low expectations. When they miss bad again tomorrow, it'll probably rocket just cuz it did last time. And it better cuz I have +10 11/19 50c and a banbet for 50 by EOD tomorrow. I almost sold my calls today for 50% loss but I decided to let it ride. It's gotta do better than Pell cuz DKNG is official betting app of NFL, NBA and NHL. But this is the same market that laughs about bond purchase taper and bad jobs reports. Honk honk🤡🤡
🍻 I holding calls for draft kings too. Let's see what happens.
Peloton should drop bikes and make sexy pants like LULU if it wants its stock to moon.
First $Z now $PTON, who did the math when valuing companies that are absolutely fucking worthless?
PTON only has value in a society locked in their homes.
I swear if silly bandz had an IPO today it’d be bigger than apple
If you got kids, anyone who makes pop-its or whatever those shits are.
DDOG. You dirty dog. I almost bought you
Anyone remember SQ last earnings... where it drilled down AH and pre-market then mooned once the market opened?

Yeah, prolly not gonna happen again....
futes green, therefore not fake and gay
Earnings reports are like companies getting their report card and stocks crashing is their parents getting pissed.
More like I got all A’s but I might get an A- next quarter because the textbook is out of stock.  *gets beaten incessantly.
Apt.
I knew PTON would be a pandemic pump destined to fade but THIS much??? Who tf likes to work out at a gym like a poor? Build a gym at your house and you’ll never miss a day!
And still have to pay a gym membership anyway! I see that as a bonus tbh. Motivates you to workout
So what do we think? Is SPY going to keep printing tomorrow?
Of course
That's all the confirmation that I need
Better pick up some 12/31 500 calls before they get rocketed to the moon
Jesus nasdaq futures. Lol.
With the way IPOs have been going this year we could just make citrus cleaning spray in my house and start selling it and branding it as chipotlaway. I’m sure we could net a 50 billion market cap for that and our subreddit would be rich. I mean hell rivian is IPOing at the same value as NIO. Can’t go tits up right?
>With the way IPOs have been going this year we could just make citrus cleaning spray in my house and start selling it and branding it as chipotlaway

lol are you stupid? you dont need to actually make the product or sell it, just go pay someone on fiver to whip up some 3d renders for you on what the spray could potentially look like and you're good to go, that worked for NKLA
Roll the spray bottle down a hill
Ahahahahhahahahaha dude you just made me snort my coffee out my nose. Well done
Fuck you’re right. I guess that’s why you’re our Wendy’s regional manager and I’m just a store manager. That’s above my pay grade sir
Sold my pton put before close. Was really happy about my measly 50% gain. Could have been a lot more jeezus
Why would you be like me?
Samesies
Sounds bout right.
Hypersonic SPY Calls

Big if true

Spy over 75 RSI on the daily for the first time since march
Still bullish, not sorry
They'll clear that up with some low volume, pre market and AH action...
It’s 75 lmao

Correction imminent 

Maybe not tomorrow but next week at the latest
Yea lol I meant 75 my bad
What's this mean
It means MMs will pull it back tomorrow to make options expire worthless and reset the RSI probably.
It means fuck your puts.
That it’s way over bought
Overbought i believe
got a feeling these meta calls are gonna pay me handsomely. tech on dips = free money
I picked up a dozen shares. To the mooooon
I’ve been weighting for zuck to moon. Should be any day now tbh
INTC takes back the performance and value crowns from AMD as review embargoes are lifted on their new enthusiast i9-12900k cpu today. It manages to make Ryzen 9 5950x look slow in comparison. Market doesn’t give a shit, nor do I.
Cause the price is awful and the chip runs hot. It doesn’t achieve that performance all the time, and the software it will be running on can’t take advantage of the new types of cores.
Lots of caveats. ~100watts more on peak load, and super pricy ddr5 to max out productivity workloads. Bullish on MU though
Same
I didnt think my processor was that far behind but im running a 6th gen and now they are up to 11...  REBUILD TIME!!
Any word on BABA earnings?
We will hear something in the next few days. I imagine they are busy as shit with all the sales and money they are making right now
Yeah, I bought calls expiring tomorrow because of earnings. I will be pissed if they expire without any earnings release. Chinese fuckers.
Increasing Chinese middle class gonna make $baba 🚀🚀
Oh don’t worry about those
Frr when tf is it
2 grand on 0dte options tomorrow at open...what do you choose? Go!
AMD, F
Tesla 1400c
Ford and AMD calls
Puts
Cider is finished carbonating. Tasting the fruits of my labors. It’s alright.
What do we think TSLA is doing tomm?
I better blast its assoff to space
sideways now for 2.5 months
Elon can't let Bezos top him.  You know TSLA is going to rocket tomorrow after a flat day today
Sideways or down
Up
It would be fucking crazy if QQQ passes SPY in value at some point. 

QQQ is now up more than SPY YTD and obviously way more in the last few years
portfolio at ATH but lost 4 option trades in a row this week. FML it fuking hurts to lose so much in a week on option
Thought I was gonna make a 10 bagger from ocgn. Never happened. Fuk
It'll come around on the next big announcement
What’s the cringiest thing you’ve seen a friend do to try and get a girl
Spend over $10,000 at strip clubs and never even getting anything out of it
Holy shit your friend is an actual dumbass
What’s up with your friend? Ten grand at a strip club should get him a sweaty, three-day, cum gargling foursome.
He has assburgers maybe that’s why. It was several strip clubs
Wrestle his friend when both of them were trying to get with her at a party. She wasn't interested in neither and walked away when they started.
A really drunk guy literally threw himself down my apartment stairs to demonstrate his love for this girl at the party
My old friend tried to ride motorcycle down a hill to impress some girls and crashed into a parked bus
Calls in ford and blizzard looking nice.
Dkng puts checking in where we at fellas
Anyone else get shafted by ocgn? Saw my call gains go from over 100% to a 96% loss in two days. Fees bad man
Yes, but still holding my shares. Calls are dead
Sold my shares for a minor profit today but held onto the call. Hopefully they moon tomorrow or I’m screwed
my 61p’s for PTON gonna be in the money at open LMAOOOOOOO
$WISH earnings. It’s going to be a beat.
Lmao it’s gonna dip worse than peloton
Really baffles me people think there is much more downside on this stock.
I went to the wish store and it looks like it was designed for a high school project in the third world.
What made nvidia run so much today? I’m in amd I hope  we get some of that energy soon lol
…been gettin it. Just more slowly. Should melt up nicely next week.
You aren't satisfied with a 5% gain? Up 35% on the month?
MSM dickheads continuing to talk about how their processors are going to run the meta verse. Yes, but no
**I’ll fuck anything that moves don’t play with me boi i’m the real dirty Dan**
..............ayo ?????????????
Seriously though...

I'm so fucking impressed with AMD and GOOGL. Just on another level. 

Smashing earnings in this tough environment with supply chain challenges is just so darn impressive 

GOOGL saw revenue growth of 40% yoy! Behemoth!
AMD has the best management and slightly undervalued.

Load up boys.
GOOGL is my forever hold. fucking beastly.
AMD saw 60%+ revenue growth during a chip shortage

Pretty awesome
AMD being a giant green dildo at the moment doesn't scream "undervalued" to me.
You can always short it or buy puts for more money.

Since you're so smart.
I am not smart, but I know a giant dildo when I see one.  


Tried shorts on BB yesterday and it Uranus'd on me.
In 20 years you’ll tell your Alexa with perfect natural language processing capabilities to make the AR overlay on your wireless Metaverse compatible sex robot a redhead with perfect tits.

You’ll be in a long distance relationship with your SO and bang each other in the metaverse via a connected Fleshlight and rabbit vibrator dildo

#DO YOU UNDERSTAND WE ARE ON THE PRECIPICE OF ASCENSION
Honestly this is the end of times
I for one will happily assimilated with our Borg overlords
WSB will own the metaverse and the zuck before all is said and done. He who controls the zuck, controls the metaverse
All we have to do is peer pressure him by saying we’ll be his friend
Adding him on MySpace as we speak
Sounds depressing
Very much so but it will make money 💰
And you’re both 400 lb ogres pretending to be humans.
Possibly, but actually you work up quite a sweat in a lot of VR games. I had to buy headbands for Blade and Sorcery. 

I mean if that’s your only exercise you’re probably a fat bastard but yeah
Sounds like a solipsistic nightmare where you can never be alone, and yet are always alone.
Why didn’t anyone tell me to buy Peloton Puts today?
I got some, not as many as I should have though.
I was looking at them this morning and then forgot about it. FML
I had chegg puts too, I feel like I struck oil twice. Problem is I only bought a couple puts each time. But both ended up 10 baggers so can't complain, made back some of the money I lost betting against tesla lol.
I made out on ATVI puts yesterday. What are you looking at next?
coin....
I like that one. They report in the AM so im late
It's next week, the sheet here was wrong
Rocket mortgage is nothing more than a mortgage document with an iPad on it. Change my mind
sorry i cant
Fuck you RKT, thank you MP and then there is my COST calls🥴
Dude I make like half my money on Costco.
👍 still can’t believe it’s run, bought a bunch of $400 calls for Jan and was selling them of slowly, now my $500s are up over 400% and don’t want to sell them just because I don’t want the extra taxes
If only visualmod was sentient enough to make retarded ban bets like us

I just issued a huge turd that was blackened like I'd just shoveled the remains of an airplane crash
hmm could be something you ate, or could be digested blood
😬
And not the kind of blood you might see after you get lucky, blood that blackens stools is from further up your GI.
See a doctor, from what I know (which is Jack shit), I think that could mean you have some kind of internal bleeding.
Stop drinking blood and youll be fine

Jesus. A PTON 11/5 $60p was $0.16 at close today. 

It’ll be worth about $5 tomorrow at open if the share price stays around $60.
[deleted]
Forgot to give Godfather Theta his share.
This will be $30 by open. And I mean the option
It's going lower than 60 tomorrow.
I put an order in for Jan $50p I know they won’t fill but it felt good just to participate
why would someone pay 5.00 for the right to sell you shares for 60.00 if the price is at 60.00 on the day of expiry

chinese riddle for ya
I was looking thinking to yolo a few contracts 😅😅 idk why I didn’t forgot all about it
Oof, there's 1,004 open interest in PTON $60 calls expiring tomorrow, priced EOD $26.45, currently with an intrinsic value of $0.10 (they'll obviously be worth more than that tomorrow at open but still).
I know how this feels from MRNA calls
Why the fuk did I buy PINS puts 🤡?
AAPL or NKE acquire should acquire PTON
I think lulu should tbh
LULU used to make merch for PTON until a few months ago. I actually see them buying PTON given this news
They don’t have enough money
Yes
  

Rescue my share

Easier said than done
I’m still doing it, wanna watch or touch ??
The S&P 500 has pretty much gone up after every nonfarm payrolls report over the past year, and often by a lot (1%+ from previous close.) I don’t really consider these as losses:

- November 2020 (October 2020 jobs report) -1 pt, 3510 to 3509

- September 2021 (August 2021 report) -1 pt, 4536 to 4535

- October 2021 (September 2021 report) -8 pts, 4399 to 4391

The way Wall Street investors think:

- Blowout jobs report, lots of jobs created, unemployment rate down -> the economy is getting better -> stocks go up

- Bad jobs report, few jobs created / unemployment rate ticks up -> central bankers keep interest rates low -> stocks go up

Can’t lose either way.
Or good jobs number. Fed may look into raising rates sooner. Market sell off.
Except if you watched the FOMC press conference yesterday, they just said they won’t.
We’ll see

**Michael**: *Hi, how much would you take this glass eye for?*

**Pawn Shop Owner**: *Three dollars.*

**Michael**: *But thats not enough to cover my rent…*
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

Is Tesla raising model 3 & Y prices considered bullish? Asking for a friend
I think in the history of commerce this will be the first time prices are being raised because demand has plummeted. So no, ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
How can demand plummet when supply is short?
How has demand plummeted? Where r u getting that from
Demand is too high for available supply lol
you def have that backwards lol
It's all bullish now until a 9/11 event that will cause massive algo correction

No, because if I would have bought calls the stock would have kept going down and bags would have gotten heavy

Dillion Francis is boring af
In Vegas, I’ve seen Avicii twice, hardwell, and RL Grime.
Avicii was special rip
Yeah RIP for sure. The first time I saw him was my first time in Vegas was when I was like 20. Bouncer took my fake ID and kicked me out but I was fucked up and I snuck into the XS at the Wynn lol.
Bro my friend couldn’t get into XS because his ID had the not 21 until thing on it. And he was 25 💀
That sucks! It’s all about walking to that restaurant that is on the edge of XS pool and hoping the railing and running into the crowd.
Lol. There was definitely a lot of guys from fraternities sneaking in with their dates for their formals.
Haha that’s awesome. You ever been to the gorge before?
No. What’s that lol.

God damn owning a house is expensive. It’s a late 50’s place that is still in great shape and redone in recent years. Already dropped $1k at Home Depot and going to go back and buy some new shitters this weekend. $HD calls
Don’t buy the kind with the button flush in the middle of the tank those suck!
That’s why I live with my parents. Fuck owning a house
Owning a house is the single most effective way of creating generational wealth.
1k?  dropped 9k on a new deck and patio
lol wait till you have to replace your flooring or windows. 9k is like the deposit.
Windows are expensive af, flooring isn't to bad here unless you go tile.  For some reason tile install is crazy expensive compared to wood/vinyl
How small is this deck that is cheap as fuck
Big deck, cheap state
Just think, if Tesla actually ever shits the bed the retard who outshines Burry himself and gets a movie deal will probably come from WSB. We are in greatness but greatness is drooling on himself right now

How many people you know that have a VR headset? How many of those people use it as their predominant source of entertainment? VR headsets are less popular now than modems were in the dotcom bubble. 

Gaming companies have been trying to make VR more than a novelty for three decades now. And you think because Mark Zuckerberg changes the name of Facebook to Meta that it's all of a sudden going to be mainstream?

John Carmack is right. They're going to throw an inordinate amount of resources at the task and have shit all to show for it.

Neil Cicierega is a piece of shit. I was such a fan of his as a kid I did a school project about him for black history month. My teacher was not amused at me picking Neil Cicierega as my topic for black history month, and Neil's woke SJW ass wasn't amused either. He fuckin got in an internet argument with me and sent people from tumblr to cyber bully me for being a reddit brony. Imagine being an adult, getting into an argument with some kid who's a big fan of yours, and sending tons of people to harass the kid on the internet?

Idk, mans.  I won't be surprised,  if it'll open at 310 with this meltup

Every day we having green
Is it too late for nvda calls
Too early, have to wait 3hrs & 27 mins
I think I am late, since 600 pre split.

I never bought, because I am afraid its the top..
That’s how I felt about MSFT but damn if it ain’t broke
Fuck it, gonna buy into every Metaverse related company and retire EOY
I’m tired of losing money on BABA gonna swing a day trade what’s the move
Up only market for tech. LFG
Some of you bought the nvda top and it shows
yeap, donating to my fellow WSBers
Yup, sure did NVDA to $330 tomorrow 11/5 exp.
Working like a slave. This 9-5 shit and then they put you into the ground is just not worth it
9-5 ain’t no slave shit
you're right, they worked by daylight and now it gets dark by 5

I turned $130 into 1k today. What calls do I buy tomorrow? I’m thinking AMD
Good thinking.... 170 EoY.
why did everyone think a company that makes stationary exercise bikes was a license to print money forever? It's not even proprietary!
It’s even worse than non proprietary, it’s just full on regarded. Treadmills/indoor bikes are for pussies who don’t like weather or temperatures that aren’t between 70-75 degrees lmfao
And don’t have kids

My coworker called my honey today. We’re the same age. I got hard
Is he cute?
He sounds like a charm
Was he cute
So did he
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
He's definitely clapping them cheeks tomorrow.
Isnt tht how old people call each other
Yeah but we’re both early 20s
Mm..hot

If you start with 1 penny, and double your money everyday for a month you’d have 21 million.
a lot easier to go all in with $10 than with $10.5 million
Hobo mindset
Stonk market are closed on weekends
I didn’t believe you but then I did the math. Seems so simple
But you can't start the game with options.
All you have to do is buy low sell high
Sell when the stock goes to the tip of the mountain. Literally free money.
isn't it better to start with a million and then end up with more money than exists?
It’s easier to start with a million and go to a penny, but I’d be able to do it in less than a month
Well fuck, now that I know it's been this easy the whole time, see you at the Lambo dealership. Jk retards🖕
TSLA market cap almost the same as AMZN, but TSLA revenue is only 10% of AMZN.

So this must mean that TSLA going to $15 trillion market cap!

Daily reminder that a chick once told me I had the perfect size penis for a small girl
Not every girl needs a massive 4 inches
So true. Anything over 3 is just showing off imo
Small girl penises are called clitties, according to this almanac i purchased from the femboy symposium.
I understood like 3 words of what u just said
Stop doing fat chicks. Problem solved.
Big ooof, ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Can’t have it all
A girl once told me it looked like I had an armadillo in my trousers.  It was quite frightening really.

Why you go on a date with a hot chick who was obviously dtf without protection?
Didn’t know she was dtf. Gonna be ready at all times now 😂
Single moms + chicks that smoke always 💯
[deleted]
Mathematical formula right there
Was she hot though
Actually hot. Had a fatttttttttttt ass, but wasn’t fat. She def works out.
Heh. Nice
Shoulda done it. Yolo
I mean depends on which hole u use
2 out of 3 holes are safe. Or one could argue 4 out of 5 perhaps, if smol pp
Pull out game weaker than your theta game
You aren’t wrong
#PTON -50% OPEN TOMORROW
PLEAS PLEAS PLEAS
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/HerrJemine123 (1/4) made a bet that GME would go to 250.0 when it was 199.84 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
GME hit $255?

Edit: u/zjz does the banbot only pull market close numbers? Not mid market?
Looooooseeerrrr!
You can't do anything with five million, Greg. Five's a nightmare. Can't retire. Not worth it to work. Five will drive you un poco loco, my fine feathered friend. The poorest rich person in America. The world's tallest dwarf. The weakest strong man at the circus.

But you can definitely retire on 5m lol

Its make a tomlett
Thats really insightful. Shit man
I start feeling like I'm becoming a better/smarter trader until I remember the market has been so easy it's almost impossible to lose money since the pullback ended like a month ago. Literally just buy weeklies just OTM in a solid ticker and it's free money within a day or two
Been doing SPY options the last week and fee the exact same way
Ford is going to $50
The only thing that gets me hard nowadays is remembering my coworker letting me put my hand down her shirt and play with her tits at work after everyone went home

She’s engaged to a crackhead now and we fell out of touch. I feel dead inside
Went all in on NVDA at close! Wish me luck guys
I’m scared to talk to women
They can smell fear
Women only want one thing from men, and it is disgusting.
Damn PTON dumping, that guy who bought $200k in PUTS is going to get paid. He had some solid analysis on why it would tank.
I fucking love that dude for life I gotta find that post
It was 20k with 95p when they were like 600 each. I bought some thanks to him. Solid analysis.
Those contracts will be worth $3k each at open if AH price holds, nice play
Ho Lee Phuk
RKT
Did $PINS report?
Come back BBBY volume
Go to $59 pton
PTON LOL
What the fuck happened with PTON? They eat another couple of children?
The bikes became sentient and have a thirst for human blood
Square uh oh
RIP OIP LONG LIVE VISUALMOD!
PTON on wsb earlier this year: "yes, 200 dollar stonk, everyone wants a peloton"
Get rkt over 20
We’ll my uber calls are gonna eat shit tomorrow
ABNB SLINGSHOT ENGAGED
Surprising amount of open interest in SPY 600c for December.  Can SPY really get to 600 in 2 years?
Anything’s possible in America
MURICA
It's gone up 125 this year, so definitely
December 2023? If so then yes, that's a 14% increase per year to get to 600. Hardly guaranteed but not impossible either. The thing is we're up 26% this year so we might get a pullback in one of those years where you need +14%.
PTON stock split 😍😍😍
PINS is going to screw everyone with a strangle.
Did they report?
Yes. They beat on revenue and earnings, guidance is bad though.
Who was the guy that did the PLTN dd to buy puts? I owe him several beers
u/JayCash00
Same
NET really volatile AH
I remember when people said NET was great value at 70 after dropping from 90 and thought they were idiots. Congrats I continue to prove that I am in fact the idiot.
SQ price action making me sick right now.  Market cant decide if they are satisfied with earnings.
They aren't

ABNB calls, Net puts, one Uber call, going to end up about breakeven I think.
Just need to mention that PTON's Jess Sims is hot as shit.
True. Kendall is my go to tho
Her equity worth way less now
Goddamn had to look her up. She bad.
man wtf is air bnb doing

Not a lot of people know this but I actually strip on the weekends. My stage name is u/vacationlover1
Yeah horrible lap dances and flappy ass man titties, noty 😘
My bad
Cheap 2024 leaps on SQ tomorrow, so at least  there's that. 😥
Can’t believe I sold half my NET at 100 after being up 100%…take profit they said
I did the same with DDOG a while back 🥲
Idiot
Why not just set up a stop loss order and enjoy the ride?
NET earnings sucked!!
467? 468 before open?
467.74
RIP PENN
pton was always just another toy for people with money burning a hole in their pocket, this was the most predictable thing ever
the same could be said for TSLA
Peleton exceeding my expectations lmao
The entire set up of what PTON is as a publicly traded company is so wild, ipo during the covid crash when gyms close down and people are now confined to their house and might as well pick up in house hobbies/ activities, now it’s a free for all and any market share they would’ve had from regular gym goers stuck home is so fucked and anyone using new hobbies colloquially to not go mad during lockdown can either dip out or pursue their new hobby in more engaging socialized environments most have been yearning for. Pray for peloton
Thoughts and prayers 🙏
PYPL only does down
It’s sad as fuck
How has nobody invented a urinal that doesn’t cause splashback??
> In the 18th century, a scientist named Benjamin Franklin invented a urinal that used suction to collect urine. Unfortunately, it was too expensive for widespread use and was discontinued after only 2 months on the market due to complaints from customers about “splashback”
Can’t splash back if you just pee your pants 🧠
I like the ones with those little spikey boy pads on the bottom
Those sloan flushless urinals with the little bumblebee are pretty great.
I know dude but I never see them!
JAPAN bruh

they are world renown masters at toilet design
I better see some gains and loss porn from NVDA players today 👁👄👁
I got 1 call option like a month out and still made $1000. Imagine people playing weeklies…….
Few weeks ago bought 10 260c 20 Jan 23. It isn't doing bad.
Welp, lost money and a ban incoming on NET then I guess.
AMZN please continue tomorrow
Got out at 700%  can't get too greedy. I'll get back in later.
I entered on the dip during power hour, fingers crossed I make it out alive haha
Should’ve picked up more PTON 5/11 $87 puts
Welp, I got my VIX calls ready. Ready for some turbulence
Damn Becky know how to go down
Damn did PTON say the N word?
Worst , their treadmill ate a black kid.
So if Rocket had records and had an increase in mortgage profits, why is RKT sinking right now?
It was expected
Last week was just FOMO in case they did another divi I'm thinking.
Who bought Coin calls
Waiting for tomorrow figure I can snap up a 0dte if it breaks out on good earnings.
Watch my Airbnb make fat stacks
Anyone who bought PTON after July 2020 > 🤡🤡🤡
AMD 140 tomorrow lol
It'll close over 140.
Who the fuck are the people that buy into streaming ads? Like hold on YouTube, I need to find out about this random dumb thing I’ve never hear of
I like the soap ads for men. That company should IPO
I personally identify as a plate so I find them offensive
Do you buy the soap?
Hell no, I’m not trying to get scammed
Until I read the reviews, those ads work on me. I like buying shit I’m a hoarder
Cramer's the type of guy to close the car windows right before he farts.

Sad. Not team RKT but was playing this earnings. Really needed a win. I am failing at everything lately.
Earnings were great. It should be better tomorrow.
Smashed earnings. Stock down slightly which makes zero sense but hoping pre market tomorrow we see some good movement.
rocket lab?
blasting off againnnnnnn
RIP square. Back to $200 you go
What's the deal with BABA earnings today? Is that before Chinese markets open?
UBER's not ded yet bois, all you cucks laughing @ 3:05 need to learn how a ER works and call into the call lol
Calls for atvi 🦍😏
Picked up some this afternoon
Atta baby
My own opinion  lol I don't want my arch nemesis breathing down my back but I think it's only going up from here after my puts now is the calls Antonio I hope your calls did you justice you prick
I keep buying PYPL call leaps. I might be retarded.
Same brother almost 80% down on my position and had to put extra margin in my account but monday on earnings week i go all in
Who really got caught off guard with PTON?
I thin Sofi approval will be 11/12 Friday after earnings. Because Varo was approved on the second Friday before the effective date. Make your bets accordingly
Thank you oracle
Uber went green!!!

I'm sorry I doubted you
Anyone else picking up some 0DTEs on gme? Looking at 230 specifically
Put a bunch of OTM strikes on a dart board and buy 10 contracts of whichever one you hit.
Wanna buy pton puts tomorrow but with my luck it will have a dead cat bounce and consolidate instead of go down like it shoukd and then when I sell the puts for a loss it will die
Might work out but buying puts on something that just dropped 25% is a dangerous game. Sometimes you just have to accept that you missed the window of opportunity and start looking for the next one
just be considerate enough to let us know when you sell please
Don’t worry I’ll be in here angry as usual when I do
I'm going to use my peloton put profits to buy a peloton. The circle of life
I’m gonna duct tape my iPad to a bike I got at goodwill for $15
I sold my skilz puts today to buy skilz stock.
Let’s dive peloton
Petition to rename the company Pelatank
CHGG's buyback can start tomorrow since it's outside of the blackout period (48 hours) after earnings.  Another user below said they have $665 million to spend.
Watch Peloton further burn to the ground.
Puts tomorrow at open then.
Memorial service for the guy that said he was going to but puts on TQQQ below
Carried by NVDA alone. Chart go up and right
Why is my sofi tanking
That’s why I’m asking myself, what news came out????
I bought 1 share of PTON today. I'm fuk.
Better that than losing $850 on a call
So $SAVA is up 90% over 5 days.  I wonder how it will look before earnings.
Their earnings always fall short. It's CTAD on the 9th that will be important, not the earnings.
QQQ calls 

Qqq go brrrrrr
This sub totally missed DDOG going to $200 now
I actually had a call that I sold for TSLA FDs ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
This thread alone has 3400 comments, but yeah you comb them all looking for plays 🤡

I saw multiple people say they were buying calls yesterday
😓
I bought one today! $170 11/26

Really SQ? Wtf? I figured that was a pretty low risk call. Literally
I mean it was 80 in February 2020. What more do you people want?
My portfolio was red all day (-20%). That final Hulk dildo saved me and I finished +3%.
Keep your head up and keep going fuckers. We’re all going to make it.
No we’re not
each day that NASDAQ refuses to correct itself, I will add  one more Christmas put
Anyone playing earnings for the piece of crap CLOV?
CLOV is next CHGG
Does anyone have any DD for upcoming earnings puts? Something like SNAP, PayPal, PTON, etc. that should fail miserably
Bntx n novax earnings
Exceptional DD, take my money
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
I was reading the daily thread and one of you nerds called the 20+% drop on peloton.
A retard in here? Must be an insider or just a retarded gay bear calling on crash for everything.
ATTENTION ALL INSIDERS: dm me if you got any news on earnings thanks
Don’t tell me they bought back that gay ass “more posts you may like” shit😑…
I was so wound up on calls I forgot to buy puts on pton. Someone tell me how fricking awesome those gains would have been
Do you really need any other excuse for divorce other than fuck this shit I’m out?
Yeah. Both have to sign the dotted line. And then comes the halving of the assets which is another battle.
Bro I would you have just left in the middle of the night. I don’t need to explain myself to you OK
I’m like 2 days away from doing that
So all I got to do is get an UPST loan buy some 0DTE spy calls and then pay the loan back right after?
There should be therapists just for retard traders, i mean retail traders
I will talk to my therapist about my trading addiction next week
Can't spell trader without retard.
Water is wet

RKT drilling after earnings
Water is actually not wet; It makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the state of a non-liquid when a liquid adheres to, and/or permeates its substance while maintaining chemically distinct structures. So if we say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the object.
If water didn’t stick to water there would only be molecules of water. I can see it. It’s wet.
Exactly. 1 water molecule can make something wet, so each one touching eachother makes both the other molecules wet as well as the surface they’re on.
wetness 
1.
the state or condition of being covered or saturated with water or another liquid; dampness.  

Water is wet.  Only the top layer of water would not be wet as it is not covered by more water. All water underneath the surface is wet.
Pltr please go to $34.69 tomorrow
I'd die I have 36- 25/26 dollar puts
ahhh that would be insane
HAha.  25-26 max
I am deep in short term calls
Financial advise: stay single and yolo your life away! Keep It Simple Stupid

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/-Disco (1/1) made a bet that CRSR would go to 22.0 when it was 25.15 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
So tomorrow is job report?
Going to catch the knife on pton shares. Question is do I do it now or at open tomorrow?
Wait for Monday.
Definitely, going to drop some more tomorrow.
Always 2-3 days on these earnings dumps. But maybe one share EOD since it’s a weekend and could gap
MSFT 340C are guaranteed to hit.  Whenever I sell covered calls on MSFT, if fucking rockets through my strike
Might log into GTA online since TTWO treated me splendidly the last two weeks.
MU is gonna wake up in a couple days wondering what happened to his brothers NVDA and AMD.

PENN calls.
MSFT leaps
Ford and AMD calls
Penn is oversold. Probably monthlies to be safe. Ford, GM leaps, AMD weeklies for earnings, TSLA puts for sure.
I’m not joking but GME. It’s MACD is just about to turn positive,
Is the show Billions worth a watch?
With all the inflation, it’s not as good as it once was - dad joke, nailed it
Yeah it's solid
Definitely. First 3 seasons are the best.
First couple seasons yes. It sucks now.
It's pretty decent. There's just something about Paul Giamatti as an actor that I just can't fucking stand
The entire show is a dik measuring competition between a rich guy and powerful guy...worth it tho
It’s amazing. Your wife’s boyfriend watches it so you definitely should too.
I've made an absolute fortune this week. Hope the markets stay green for a few more months at least!
Nice bro good job. What did you make money from?
As of yesterday, SPY is trading in its channel from the 5 months before September. Last year, it didn't rise quite back into its channel.

SPY's (and also the S&P 500 by connection) didn't drop as much as a percent of price compared to last year (about 7% compared to 10% last year) but typically when you have a rebound, unless the trend is extremely strong it bounces off the bottom of its old channel, more or less, resulting in an off-shifted trend.

This is also the trendline that many bear theses assume is a hard stop (which is usually followed by a randomly shaped downtrend line, usually in the shape of an Elliott correction wave to make it look like they put effort into thinking about it LOL).

To be fair, it wasn't a bad prediction that it would bounce off the old trendline resistance as that commonly happens, but it was pretty dumb to think that meant we were headed for a crash. But far from just adhering to its normal pattern, it actually broke trend upward and held that upward trend.

I still expect SPY to go down for OpEx weeks, and certain events like the debt ceiling in early December concern me, but I feel bad for any bears dumping money into puts constantly thinking "big number must come down!" The current upward trend in the whole market is so strong that betting against it without a strong conviction on a specific security seems kinda silly.
So we’re still buying calls, right?
Hell yeah we are. At least until the beginning of OpEx... but even then, maybe.
😎
Yes, specifically anything above 500

Alright i think i can work with that.
I wanna thank all the people in this sub that helped me make money today. If not for you I would have never realized that SAVA was halted premarket allowing me to make a bunch of money on a momentum play. Gods bless WSB.
AMD  going crazy
Which makes me wonder why nvda is bleeding 

They were on similar paths earlier.
Amd calls first thing, hope for nvda ramp. Got it.
Which calls?
Probably do something stupid like 139c FD 0dte

#BEARS REKT LMAOOOOOOOOOO
Why do they even try lmfao
So bulls can keep making monies. When the last bear gives up, it’ll be a somber day
we've said it before- The Bear is like a guy that gets laid once every 3-4 years. But.... it's with a supermodel.
I rather eat the asses of several 7’s
In 1999 any company could add 100b market cap by launching a website, selling tech ideas that were at least a decade off. In 2021 any company can add 100b market cap by saying “metaverse”, and oculus quest 2 and competing technologies are still virtual potato simulators 🥔
Yes, it’s 1999. Just watch yourself. Most here don’t care to realize it.
ya this market is very reminiscent of 1999. There's even the same anti trust stuff against big tech, trouble in china, MSFT was the biggest cap at the time, i could go on.....not predicting a crash just saying looks verrrry similar. once rates get around 2% look out.
lolz, kids love them, nuff said
Yeah, because nobody knew what a website was. You can't correlate this with the past. These companies all produce something tangible. Not just a URL. I was there. Gen X for the win.
Not the same, but some parallels. If you’re an X-er you might know John Carmack’s street cred, who even called it a “honey pot trap” at this stage. Maybe it won’t be a decade but the technology, infrastructure, and dev of widely available and affordable monetized platforms are many years down the road.
I need a hug
Biiiiig huuuuuug
Damn, so many Gain Porn today. Tech gonna destroy all other stocks this year.
Might sell my 3 shares of DWAC that I bought at $16. Not even meme worthy anymore. Just sad :(
I wish I had the stones to put my entire port at risk like some of you retards. Could be looking at some serious gains by now.
Or you could have zero funds to invest/ gamble with
way more likely outcome
Hence the "could".
Can someone explain exactly why PENN is better than DKNG when I can gamble at home on my couch pantsless with DKNG but PENN makes you walk into a casino to place the bet?

Seems like a boomer idea
penn has the barstool app, which is the same as dkng
Pton and chegg crashed, what does that mean for zoom? A lot of competition, a lawsuit, and people are going back to the office. How are they not going to crash?

P/E of 85? I don't feel like they will stay over 200 come earnings.

Not to mention they are putting ads in their free version of Zoom.
Duno but covid favorites are definitely getting extra punished with market sentiment as of late.

ZM is a lil different though as the adoption rate retained significantly vs other obvious names that got really boosted by covid.

Might just buy some lotto puts without any DD given how everything else has been doing.
Idk chegg and pton were half of their ath and still crashed. ZM is pretty much in the same spot.
Yeah that's another rey why I didn't bother with puts even though I was bearish on those two (along with Z).

At 52 week low you just had to wonder how much more did it have to go you know?

Turns out, a lot.
I feel like Zoom will still replace work calls. People found out it’s nice to see a face instead of just have a conference call. I’m back in the office but still zoom now and then. But yeah probably puts anyway.
Enlighten me. How is TSM not more valuable? They have almost 1trillion In cash and make 400b a quarter In rev. Unless yahoo finance numbers are incorrect.
I think they have over 1T in assets but I don't think they have that much cash.

WSJ says 600+ billion in cash

[https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSM/financials/annual/balance-sheet](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSM/financials/annual/balance-sheet)
Ahh thanks for that. Still insane amount of cash. Equals the current market cap almost in just cash.
Yeah don't fight the trend I guess. Not a popular stock like NVDA so it doesn't get any love.

AMD was that way so maybe if/when TSMC does start moving I will try and jump on it. What other choice do we even have, they dominate the fab space and are hyper aggressive in expansion and R&D
Not USD. TWD. Divide by 30
Looking out for the tarded. Bless you.
I’ve made similar assumptions before! Tikr is a decent free site for financial info and they have a little convert to USD toggle for currencies.
It will go up eventually. It seems like it’s narrowing out in that wedge. 

The concern that’s keeping it down, from what I am aware, is two-fold:

1.) China is scary 

2.) TSM is so absolutely dominant, with market share that’s in like the high 90%’s, that some investors are worried they have nowhere to go but down, *in terms of growth*.

These are both related to various world Gov’s wanting to reduce reliance on Taiwan for semiconductor production. 

Personally though that’s all bullshit because China isn’t going to invade Taiwan, the Taiwanese are like a decade ahead of their competitors with tech, and TSM is making a god damn US factory ffs. 

I’m bullish,  it’s a play im very interested in. Going to observe price action for the next few weeks and see if I like what I see.
 Going to do some.more.research on it. The US factory is interesting. That's a game changer for the Chinese fear factor. Plus china has really shit the bed lately.  I think China has their own problems domestically they need to address before they can invade other countries that are close allies to the US. Especially one that makes 90% of the worlds chips. Taiwan is of major national interest to keep sovern.
3. Water scarcity (really numba waaaaaan)
400b TWD is only $15 billion USD. Still great numbers but they’re not raking in trillions a year
Yeah that makes so much more sense. Special school over here. Just learning about exchange rates.
Because the market is regarded. It will go up its inevitable
Had to look up regarded. 😂

Alright. Just come back with food next time.
Read that as shoplifting, which is what I expect bears to have to do for their kid's Christmas presents. Bonus if at Walgreens
EVERYTHING IS PRICED IN
If you have to ask, the answer is that it's priced in
CRSR is such a piece of shit but I guess I’ll tell myself it’s worth the long term capital gains tax
Sitting in a drive thru line at Wendy’s.. using a $20 gift card my brother got me for my birthday.. just in case any of you were wondering what I was up to right now

Which side are you playing
I am so fked…I bought pin puts and went to bed 
Stock rose 6.5 percent post market and now I am looking at fake gains

Out of the all the earnings plays. You decided to buy puts on a stock that was reaching its lowest. Lmao 😂

V p/e 35, forward in the 20s
This means short SQ, not go long PYPL.
SWBI 3.8
Watching two things:

&#x200B;

1. CVNA reported widening loss and bearish guidance.  Financing activities brought in $1.8B for them this year and they are only left with $400M in cash as of 9/30/2021.  That's a $1.4B cash burn over 9 months.  So they have enough cash on hand to run things through mid-December and then filing for Ch. 11 unless they do an equity raise (can't do because Garcias lose control) or another bond issuance.
2. Would love to wake up tomorrow to a corn price over $63,000 and heading to $65,000 during the trading day.

&#x200B;

So I have CVNA puts and RIOT calls all expiring tomorrow.

&#x200B;

I expect the puts to work out. 

The calls are probably fukt.
Where you getting this CVNA info from?
[https://investors.carvana.com/\~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/events/cvna-shareholder-letter-q3-2021-final.pdf](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/events/cvna-shareholder-letter-q3-2021-final.pdf)

Widening loss in opening statement and page 10 graphic.

Cash flow statement page 14 shows financing activities and cash remaining as of 3Q21.

Bearish guidance opening statement.

&#x200B;

They can pull from credit facilities instead of spending cash but that's a liability all the same.

&#x200B;

Their total MC is higher than Ford's when you include Class A and Class B (voting 10X of Class A) shares.

&#x200B;

I have a feeling they are hiding losses in that ballooning $2B+ inventory number where they say they only have 16k cars ready to sell.

&#x200B;

This fat pig is about to get stuck and put on a spit.
I'm definitely reading through this, I've been aware of their issues and overvaluation and been looking for a short opportunity but they just keep getting bid up for no reason
Tightly controlled.

&#x200B;

Won't be much longer with a share dilution coming since the bond market won't support their risk.

&#x200B;

Without financing activities this company is bankrupt.
how does CVNA lose money when the used car market has literally never been this hot before, like never before at any point in history
How are we feeling about FB tonight? Im hoping for a new ATH by tomorrow
I just want to play grand theft auto in the metaverse.

Hopefully next month.
Would it work to boof kratom extract. Asking for a friend…
Why do I have the Don Henley song “In a New York minute “ playing in my head all day?
Now it’s in my head.
i just read 95% of active traders and 60% of fund managers dont beat tthe market so that means fund managers are better
Usually this is such a sad fucking statistic but SPY is simply up like 41% on the year so I don’t even blame anyone rn lmao
Ya wsb has a hard realization if someone is up 10-20% but didn’t beat the index.
It’s a weird year in all honesty, timing has been key since 2020 like I definitely walked out green as shit but all jokes aside I completely understand how people are getting fucked in this market. Price/ volatility barrier for where you actually make any meaningful return blocks so many people and it’s such a small window usually.
If you’re not buy and hold yes it can be. But you could just buy msft or TSLA and you’d be fine.
Barf.
NKLA puts
Looks like i am holding my 11 475C 10/11 till exp

Sorry dad I just love 🇺🇸

Yes
I’d love to see what you’re up. Every call you’ve made over the past was month was not gone the way you said.

TSLA. Spy. 


Spy calls are daily 10-30% with low risk. You can even do it multiple times.
How far out? 0dte?
Spy I usually do next 1-2 expiry. It’s 3x a week. So mondays I’ll go with wed and fri expiry etc. 


TSLA is quite expensive so you’re gambling the weeklies
Been loading up on $pypl 230//235 calls. Selling some. Holding some. Buying more. Dec/Jan exp
Watch 20k daily profit either evaporate before selling late, or sell profitably and lose 15k chasing, or lock in and freak about the 60k I didn't get as it keeps running after the little bounce.  Then end the day stressed about my mistakes, completely ignoring the 5k I actually pulled in.
Buy anything, it's really hard to lose money in this market
Yet a lot of us manage it lmao
Jerking off to pictures of bulma from DBZ farting

DKNG bros good luck, hopefully earnings are great. Got fucked in the ass hard today give us a 10% day tomorrow
I own 1000
Shares of PTON at 67. Should I sell at open or hold and just kinda hope for a slow recovery
that's going to be a looong recovery, IF they recover.
Agreed. And I’d rather put my money in stocks with upward momentum than banking on a downward one to recover.
Just did the math and in poor
Is SQ earnings going to hurt V even more? or priced in
I think it’s holding this price pretty well. Don’t think SQ will have an impact.
Yea I hope so. I have some $215 puts I sold that expire tomorrow and I hope the stock doesn’t drop even more. Will prob have to roll it out a few weeks
You know bears are worried when they stop the spy hate and delivert it a tech ticker that seemingly went up all day. I think they're just mad they missed out on tech by being distracted with "wen market crash"

Pole assassin
Stop with the monkey business
Lot of heat taken off her when the CFP actually assassinated a poll 2 days later
Lol I heard about that
Thinking of LCID 2 weeks out puts for tomorrow, any feedback I’d appreciate.
Any chance their earnings will be anything but shid???
I think they’ll beat ER
Probably not, they didn't sell any cars last quarter. EPS doesn't matter in this case. Analysts just want to hear the guidance and get an idea of sales for next Q.

That being said, I do expect it to go down. But IV crush makes puts seem like a bad idea
Fair enough, I am not messing with their ER, just looking to day trade it tomorrow, maybe onto early next week.
Lmao they sold 10 cars. How they gonna beat when everyone knows deliveries already?
Ok, fair advice.
Airbnb
Hope it sees 185 tomorrow
Harder they fall …fuking banging, nflx deserves my 18$ this month
Fortinet FTNT crushed earnings today!
Duh. Everyone plays Fortnite
Also there are current supply issues lots of network manufacturers don't have supply in stock (might be on a boat) and Fortinet controls their supply chains because they like make their own chips or something. as of this second at least.
i bought pypl and SQ today so tears
Pypl might run a little tomorrow but who knows. Got 200 shares at 230 something
I love watching noobies learn about IV crush. I’ll never forget my first lesson in it. Back when PLTR was going up retard strength I bought calls at the top.
I honestly still don't get it. Like I get that flat is bad and IV crush. I get that during high IV and position moving against me basically means I'm fucked but I still don't get it.
I've got SPY $470 calls that expire tomorrow. What do you think I can get for them at open?
$1 when Jpow news hits premarket

I do too and I damn sure won’t sell on the open

Do it, being unsure about marriage has never been a problem. If it ends up being a lot just have a kid they fix everything.
If you are going off of parents insurance and she has quality insurance it's a good call.
I was 27. It’s fine just marry someone cool.
Married at 26, 1st kid 28yo, 30yo now with 2 kids, house and stable career
No way I would do that

Snek?
Keep buying kids. Mandates should be a boon for business after our supply chain wrecked Christmas.

God bless you kiddos
Just start buying shit now
Are you telling us to buy children? Or referring to us as kids?
Are you 6? What do you care about fucking Christmas?

Yeah. I feel a little dumb for asking
Yes. The market said no.

Fisker, Sofi and NIO baby
Whatever you have in fisker you should put in NIO

I think that one will do fine as well but NIO has different reasons to me to be bullish. Their tech is mandated and they hold all the patents. They also are the highest quality carmaker in existence currently beating even Tesla.

Pros and cons of dating a crazy girl?

By crazy, I mean going to psychic every week and mood swing every other hour.
Cons - get yelled at , Pros - Crazy sex
Pros: she will probably fuck pretty good

She will probably be down to actually do stuff instead of sitting around vegetating on her phone

Sometimes she’s gonna be super into you because of your chart or is gonna read signals from the stars as reasons to fuck you or treat you good

Cons: she’s unpredictable

She’s like 15% more likely to cheat on you

If her witchy occult shit is just like a month long phase, she’s probably going to turn into a frumpy housewife with no appreciable skills who gets chubby and fucks you way less often. 


Conclusion: go for it, but make sure not to get baby trapped.
She got ESPN?
Deep throat
I don’t think my penis is long enough for her to deep throat but ok.
Sounds like my mom. Don't do it
make sure the sex is good

If there is a next time I won’t let high IV convince me not to buy puts on company who’s treadmills have been eating pets and children…. No regrets. But man. Missed out on that.
When you put it this way, I feel like this week's fintech and oil calls were so stupid.
Did some small steel company calls instead just based on the entire industry beating expectations. Both crushed earnings and spiked in ah. May get close to the same return depending how the calls go tomorrow morning.
Nice!! I should have jumped on that train. I have good rides with CLF when it gets below $23 and I get a 2 week out call. Which ones had a good ER and spike?
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/theCramps (0/3) made a bet that SPY would go to 477.62 when it was 459.25 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

You think we hit spy 450 again before the end of this month? I want to get in on a consolidation but this looks like it’s never gonna fucking stop ripping
It is known
Yup I think today was a good day to take profit on trades and wait on consolidation and dips
I doubt it pulls back again until the fed starts raising rates for real. It may be a slow grind up though. SPY 500 eoy may be a bit optimistic. But 480 may not be.
I’m thinking most headwinds are behind us. Fed is still in bulls favor. I think we go up them melt up during the Santa Clause rally. I’m at 30% margin and keeping it until February which is another seasonal down month.
Fuck, CANT sleep on my DKNG calls for tomorrow ER 🥃🥃

Love u
You jerk off on Fridays?
No, he said "big" day. It must be something else.
Are they in a basket?
Cloudflare is literally the software equivalent of Tesla. It literally never goes down and will likely double in market cap at this point and be over 400 next. Completely overpriced but still will continue to go up as long as rates stay stagnant.  If this trend continues there is Zero chance they don't buy Fastly at 2x premium to take over enterprise CDN business which unlike Fastly they can actually effectively monetize. FSLY 100 NET 400
No calls are sold at 400 for net
How does Cathy's analysts go through the daily thread everyday?

You have to shuffle through so many weird comments before you hit a gold nugget.
Her fund is getting destroyed since Q3 earnings started
I didn't say she was doing a good job. I implied she was relying on WSB for plays.
If you've seen her trades lately, you'd know the answer is "badly".
Yeah. But she doesn't even seem hurt by her overnight Z losses.
Not her money, not her problem. So long as people buy ark, she gets fees.
She got super lucky with Tesla but it's impressive how much money she was (and is) able to accumulate through her fund.
I’m a disinformation agent hired by citadel, but keep it hush hush.
Citadel is so gossipy on twitter and I bet they all visit WSB time to time.
It’s true, we are really sloppy, I wish my team would rein it in, but basically, our boss is a giant fucking loser and the only fun part of coming to work is the juicy gossip and the interoffice relationships.
I can't really tell if you work for Citadel or not because your last paragraph sounds legit.
Sounds like mission accomplished.

So far, I’ve lost $1k from poker to some of the loosest players in the fucking world and I have the Main Event on Sunday. So yeah, I need to cash to breakeven for this whole trip or I’m gonna have some stuff to write off.

Let me tell ya, options trading is sooooo much easier than this fucking game. God I love poker. $AAPL to $160. $SPY to $500.
Expiration? I’m a retard so I’ll follow you
Oh, I got LEAPS on $AAPL. $80c’s and $100c’s expiring some time next year. Nothing on $SPY right now. They’re just correlated.
Okay, I’m gonna yolo 2.5k on $SPY 520 1/21 with about 150x
My god. Godspeed. That’s one hell of a gamba

How often do you guys enter trades that print solely based on posts and comments from this sub?
The DD is better than the comments for sure. Comments are straight trash during market hours, people just cheer for whatever is going up that day
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)
The key is to get in before the pump and not hold through the dump. Most random stocks mentioned here are literally pump and dumps.
I look through post, but ultimately I bet what I'm willing to lose. I don't yolo into anything cuz i'm too much of a pussy
As someone who doesn’t browse religiously I’m curious about how many legit plays get thrown in here. I imagine for every legit play there’s 10 bad ones though. A friend was following this sub during the beginning of the pandemic and printed a lot from following plays on this sub
The only religious plays I see working here are monthly SPY or TSLA calls
What percent returns do you see from 1 mo. out SPY calls? Was always curious about that
Varies widely, but 50-100% is generally my exit, lost some gains but have been burned too many times to hold forever.

I do further OTM for monthlys and a few dollars OTM weeklies.

It isn't always a win, but I can at least limit my losses and reevaluate.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Realistically, I think only MSFT 200c 3/20 and ULTA during April 2020. Unless something's really popping off like TSLA as of late or there's an obvious trend, I only really play like 3-4 tickers consistently
The guys that randomly post ticker price targets for the week are sometimes spot on. On the daily thread I recall seeing someone post “Nvda 300 🚀” yesterday or the day before. 

Honestly the easiest way to formulate trades is to follow a few companies closely 2-3 weeks before earnings season and pay attention to the OI and volume on the option chain.
If you heard on the sub 80% of the time you’re too late 20% you might get lucky and see more pump.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Half the time at least
Do you mainly read DD posts to find those plays?
Fuck no, those are comic relief.   The daily thread is always and only where it's at
Time to shake the casino doors like a 5 year old finding their dead puppy.

Dr. Jaynus. Hugh Jaynus.
It’s prob just toilet bowl water

NET is insane lol
DKNG Fucked Princess Peach this quarter, Bullish.
Why did you have to make it so easy to reply with *ape-ish*? I have to live with myself on a daily basis. Hourly is enough.
Pahmp it!
Gotta love how my extremely simple peloton dd comes true a year later
What the fuck is up with all the covid comments
Maybe it's the front page of drudge report (which makes it look like a thing again)
He trash
Calls on me being tired
Debit spreads on power naps
iron condors on my wifes big ass
SQ getting a beat down. Hopefully just a dip.
FB post market looks dope. 340 at open.
I have a feeling that my tsla fd will fuk me.
When the 2024 leaps came out I bought 2 puts on peleton when it was around 110

Finally came back home after working covid units out of town wiping ass and cleaning dentures.

Going to smoke a fat one and watch the comments live as usual.

I’m down 30% on them 😭
Soon
I’ve been doing this for way too long to get excited over the 5AM pump. 

I’ve seen a lot of these go red by open. Just don’t disappoint me $NVDA
Huge earnings for cloud companies. Very bullish on NET, DDOG and CFLT
Where was this DD a week ago
It was here. But all you see on this sub now is TSLA DURRRR and other pump and dump schemes. Quality has gone downhill massively.
OMG, is PTON going to pull a CHGG?
No
can spy stop running until market open. i put order to buy spy 500 calls for dec 31. i would like that it wont make it more expensive.
https://ibb.co/dMQ51f2

Should have copped when they were dirt cheap
its not Fridays then lotto tickets are on sale?
They were on sale Oct 29th w/ 5 mil buy orders on SPY w/ no news
Currently eating tenderloins out of a deer i shot 4 hours ago 👍
Done that too! Nothing like the feeling of success while eating the freshest of veni tenderloin and having a cold beer
Going to WI in a couple weeks to get mine.
Why the FUCK is PTON dropping?!?? Didn’t you guys hear about the Spotify deal??! Or the airline deal?😡
It’s just a treadmill
A treadmill that eats children.  Very unique.
Because they missed earnings hard and guidance is awful lol
That was sarcasm
Oops
All good 😂
Damn Henry Ruggs is fucked
Dude deserves what is coming for him. Girl he killed literally burned alive in her car with her dog. Absolutely terrible
Tell that to the loved ones of the woman he killed
Just looked it up he’s seriously fucked
Just wanna be a millionaire overnight. Is that too much to ask?
I don't even need that much money in the big scheme of things I just need it all and I need it now
Pwobably
That 4.4K to 720k yolo post is what WSB dreams are made of. Not these Nancy boys with TSLA shares sitting in their accounts from 10 years ago. Real degenerate gambler going on a 2 week heater 🔥🔥🔥 I love it. Go upvote it now
and he cashed out too. WSB guh avoided!
My erectile dysfunction was cured after seeing that post
he had a heat check🔥

Seeing an increasing amount of girls walking around with short fat dudes wtf is going on
white boy summer has turned into Fat Boy Winter
Winter is coming bro get yourself a fat chick.
I can’t do it. It feels like wrestling a polar bear.
Sounds like you’ve been around the block a few times on this one
Only once. Tequila made me do it. I woke up, outside, with this polar bear laying next to me. I slithered out from under her and dipped. I pushed my motorcycle a block so she wouldn’t hear me start it and try and catch me.
You guys are legit horrible.
Not really any different than women who won’t even give an ugly dude the time of day.
Most girls don't base their dating life based on how the guy look.
I’m searching for a downside and I’m coming up dry.
Bro is the girls also fat. Cause here I'm swiping tinder and dang there's like so many ugly fat chicks online no offense.
Lot of fat ugly chicks on dating apps that like to think they're a 10 lol
George Costanza vibes 😎
Pussy likes being put on a pedestal
You’re probably built like a holocaust survivor
I'm 6 feet 185 lbs and workout 6 days a week so unless they got to the camp right before it got liberated I'm thinking no
Gme millionaires get girls
Baba is trash wtf
Very disappointed with this trash of a stock.  It goes up then right back down…if your gonna get it get long dated calls only.  I’ve lost a lot with short plays.  Not gonna do that again. Too many other stocks to do that on like spy!
I've been telling everyone. If it hits over 170, buy the 160p for 2 weeks out.
I love eating pussy bc I just think of all the dicks she’s had inside her and it turns me on to taste them all. 

PTON 30p 11/5
Truly a gay bear
No bc I’m still eating pussy.
Yeah but they are man pussies

I looked at 'em a few times in the first five minutes but they are too expensive.
Same, but for the last 5 years
Being a waiter is useless job. I’ll write down my order, take it to the cook, then bring it to my own table when it’s ready. 

#END TIPPING CULTURE
It's so bizarre that the rest of the world is able to have functioning dining with no tipping.  It's almost like it's a way to get the American consumer to pay the wages of the worker so the business doesn't have to.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Strongly agree. Even worse is when career waitstaff try to opine about how their job is so difficult and how they actually “make great money”.  Shut up ffs
Ever been to a restaurant that actually uses a tablet at the table? Or Dave and busters you use your phone and scan the table. It’s a dream, no wrong orders and it’s quick
Yeah Applebees and Red Lobster in certain locations actually.
what a poor.

I tip all the time
I give your wife the tip all the time, it's all she can handle.
I'm single
So like, do you want the tip?
Got a little secret for you son. Most jobs are useless
I’m an essential worker 💅🏻
It’s all part of the experience of being in a restaurant. It’s a luxury to have food delivered to you. If you don’t like it come to Wendy’s not Outback retard. Or order curbside.
they expect you to tip on curbside too tho
Even Pizza Hut asks for a tip when you order online. Like bruh no you already pay your employees a fair wage I expect?
The weed dispo changed to curbside only, order ahead.  I show up and hand them my card and exact change and they bring back my order and hang around staring at me like i owe them extra.  Nobody ever tipped me for getting their air conditioner working.
Lmaoooooooooooo 😂😂😂 tipping culture getting out of hand. Everyone expects a tip for a job they’re already getting paid for!
Really? I tip my handy men for repairs
In Japan they have conveyor belts bring food to you
#I TOLD YOU TO BUY PTON AND NET PUTS BITCH!!!!!!
You were half right
Someone on theta gang sold PTON puts before close bc “I DoNt MiNd BeiNg AssIGnEd At LoWeR PriCe” 

Bet they mind now
The market doesn’t make sense. What does make sense is peloton crashing. Anyone see people in those stores? Anyone know peloton owners? Do you own a peloton?
In 5 years PTON will be forgotten
Have you used one? It’s pretty fricken fun and the instructors are mad sexy
Flattest TSLA after hours I’ve seen in a few weeks
Hoping to wake up to at least 10 points up. Not too much to ask
Everything is pretty flat...
Pelton square roku zoom... All dogshit speculative tech 

Now the big boys like GOOGL, AMD, FB are differentiating themselves... There's tech and there's tech.
Every day I have to convince myself not to put my entire port into GOOGL and I’m not sure why cuz that would honestly be the smartest move
My screen is cracked and I lol’d because I read BB instead of FB
As a hardcore NVDA bull. Just some preface for this valuation.

&#x200B;

Take whatever FB would be buying in "Metaverse" graphics chips. Multiply it by x2, add some extra 50% margin ontop and factor in no risk, like cryptocrashing, the chip shortage, supply chain issue, China threatening Taiwan. 

&#x200B;

You get a price target of $250............Love Nvidia and Jensen Huang, but for this reason.   


I'm out. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
careful, not supposed to be logical here.
Dudes started cancelling subscriptions and putting those bikes on craigslist after thier fat ass wives made em buy the shit and just got fatter.
i love each and every single one of you
That’s irresponsible considering statistically at least one of us is a murderer, and murderers typically target those they love.
NVDA 330 EOD tomorrow
u/cashflow_ the type of guy to leave his number on  the receipt at hooters thinking they’ll call him 🤡
500/date, call me. Works
Shit you’re giving me ideas lol
At least there’s no mystery if they’re only with you for your money.
Calls for nvda. Shits going right back up after open
Hope so. Grabbed a lotto ticket for tomorrow

So basically all these stocks shitting the bed means SPY 550 by end of jan if not dec due to covid/bad job #
I hope people realize you’re right.
it’s so true it’s not funny
🤡🤡 market making all the boomers richer. Makes it harder for the young guys like to build a stable portfolio, when my cost average is so high. 

And of course, boomers will cash out and die near the top, and I’ll be stuck in a 20 year bear market 🥺
Most young investors are dumb yoloing 1dte options. It’s only the top for now… just like it was when boomers invested and the DJ was 4,000 points. If you think the market is going to suck then make money being a bear. And then buy at the bottom for another huge rally.
Gotta do riskier plays to hit now a days
20 year bear market is bound to be volatile as fuck

lots of gains to be made active trading then, both directions
Lol easier said then done. But yeah this shit right now is straight vertical… can’t possibly end well
Yes, this last decade it's been really hard to make money. Oh, and "stable portfolio" is what you're looking to do from WSB? Sorry dude, you're a fucking idiot.
Oh no, I’ve lost tens of thousands gambling options and then decided to retire and actually make money. I’m not an idiot, I’m an autist 😉
Have you guys ever stuck your finger up your wife’s ass. I did tonight and it was funny
Her reaction was?
Its all fun and games until your finger turns brown
Almost every time. Make sure your fingernails are trimmed
Now do your tounge.. thank me later..
Stay away from my wife!
Yup
Yes, I’ve stuck my finger up your wife’s ass
How many facebucks does it cost in the metaverse to have a bigger bulge on my avatar?

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/nskidder (0/1) made a bet that AAPL would go to 135.0 when it was 151.73 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
We do in fact need another stimulus. But this stimulus must go directly into SPY. 

For 🇺🇸s sake, SPY must hit 600 this year. That is necessary, crucial, and paramount. Else Gyna wins.
I don’t think that’s how it works but hey if y’all wanna try it out then by all means lol.
Elon Musk and Grimes' baby gonna be weird af, they're both crazy

Dave Portnoy spitting in chicks mouths just tells me he doesn’t know how to dick chicks down. Just hate fuck and then blow them off like a normal degenerate
Fact, I was gonna comment on how this dude needs to record, spit, choke (which is fine but still), like this dude really doing all that on a hookup LMFAO
This is why Charlie Sheen only bangs porn stars.
You don't pay whores for sex. You pay them to leave and shut the fuck up about what you do to them.
Personally I don’t get the violence in the bedroom thing but I get it if both parties are in to it lol. Just not my cup of tea when I think of a woman I like I don’t want to do something violent to them I got better things in mind ;)
I'm not a huge fan of it either but sometimes I'm feeling weird and spit into her mouth, never record that shit though LMFAO
Yeah like them being violent towards me 🤤
Everything in the world is about sex. Except for sex. Sex is about power.
Wait. what?
Ever since I started trading spy options I have built an unhealthy tolerance to losing money wtf. I use to freak out about 1-2k but now I casually watch 20k get thanos snapped in 30 minutes. This can’t be healthy
Money hits differently when it’s just numbers on a screen. My portfolio fluctuates 5k and I don’t care but that’s a lot of money for your average person.
plebs r fuk
This but unironically.
change to show %change that will help
You need some Dave Ramsay
Wtf jajjaja Im so scared that thats gonna happen to my DKNG calls tomorrow.
DKNG going high on earnings, real high!
scale down when you aren’t sure

Just upgraded TSLA to BUY, 1300 incoming tomorrow
What?
Based on the fundamentals, I have concluded that TSLA is UNDERWEIGHT-- I have subsequently initiated a BUY rating with a weekly price target of 1300
Birthday is tomorrow. 1300 would be amazing.

PTON puts were such a fucking good move
no way nvda doesn’t retrace to at least 285 tomorrow right? RIGHT? someone cuddle me please i blew up my portfolio
No
Yo I've been rewatching SpongeBob and it's actually insane how many hints there are of Patrick being a low key genius IQ day trader. If wsb was around in 2002 this would have been noticeable but instead it was super subtle to audiences at the time.

Favorite example is one I just got to, Sandy says to him "don't you have to be stupid somewhere else?" and he says "not until 4"
The market closed at 4.. asshole
Best time to buy options tho
😘
Market is roaring, Hope everybody made that 💰
Stimi checks are gone. 

Selling $2000+ bikes and $3000+ treadmills...lol, when people are out of free cash no wonder PTON tanks. They're selling shit to the elitist 1% audience.  Imagine being dumb AF getting stuck with monthly financed payments for a stupid indoor bike or treadmill.  Then also being stuck with monthly class payments.  You know those suburban husbands are cussing up a storm inside of themselves because their wives nagged incessantly to get the pton bike and treadmill, used it for 4 months, and now it sits collecting dust while they're stuck with payments for the next two years.  Oh yeah, you still need weight lifting equipment too, so you still got your gym membership going.  

Husbands will say no mas to payments for working out (gym membership for weights+bike+treadmill+pton class memberships) that are now totaling a new car payment and pton sales gonna tank.
My wife got a nordic track that has all the capabilities of ptons top bike for about 700 which included 3 years of a superior subscription service. When IFIT lists, PTON is going to get smacked down again.
IFIT is going to kick PTON right square in it's becky loving dick.
[deleted]
Cant go outside, thats where the cars live
That's great!

We are talking about pton bikes and treadmills here!
2 mins of silence for Karen's n boomers who bought PTON at $180
be honest, who else is cash gang and FOMOing super hard. I feel like this is what the market wants us to do, go all in and bam, rug pull. I know it
Yup. I made a measly $1,250 today trading NVDA calls. Would have been over 10k by noon. I simply did not have the fortitude to hold. But I also do this for a living and have blown up an account before. Leaving money on the table sucks. But NOTHING sucks more rhan losing it all. And I mercilessly cut losses at 15%.  Always. Doesn't matter if it comes into profit later. I've never taken a loss bigger than 15% and never will. My $980 play on NVDA went 123% in 15 min and that was good enough for me. Takes car of all my bills for the month actually.
I had a great day and closed a lot of positions before market close. My timing on the NVDA call was perfect and incredibly lucky. I’ve got some positions open but I have a lot more cash on hand. I’m probably going to transfer it to my savings account so I don’t gamble it away. 

…Unless you know of a single day trade I can make tomorrow.
all in on Dominos pizza

then puts on your blood cholesterol
bad news - I bought PTON at 86 two weeks ago. 

good news - I sold at 95 before earnings
SPY TO 500 EOM
We will see NVDA fly again tomorrow I predict 💚💦
cash gang will always be cash gang, no dip is ever low enough. Spy could hit 300 tomorrow and they’d still be like imma wait for 250
Imma wait for 2 fitty
This is why I'm no longer cash gang, I accumulate and keep a puts account so I can leverage down in case rare red.
First thing im finna do on the metaverse is watch porn
I’m going to JPows house and eating all his cereal
I've never seen futures so consistently flat before. Nobody knows that's coming next. We could moon. We could dive. We could trade completely flat for 8 years straight.
Stop thinking so much. Go to sleep.
I'm just watching YouTube videos of people running from the cops on motorcycles and drinking light beer
Guessing it's cause the jobs report comes in tomorrow or some shit like that? Unemployment? 
I don't even know anymore.
The jobs report and the vote for infrastructure bill both happening tomorrow morning.
Hmm...I could try something new... but I do love me some SPY calls. Ol' trusty.
So Portnoy had some rough rapey sex. 

These foolish women don't even ask about safe words nowadays, it's not rocket appliances
The article and accusations are stupid. Chicks playing victim
Regards being regards
I had a FWB who used to ask for that kind of sex
I was under the assumption all women do.

Not this softy kissy r&b stuff
I tried the vanilla sex and she said “is that all you are going to do”
Doesn’t matter. All we need is allegations. Let’s see how long will he survive.
NVDA, we doing the same dance tomorrow? I'll make sure to throw my whole portfolio into you this time.
NVDA is the new TSLA
Except with the earnings and future growth to justify its stock price.
Some of the best bags I’ve ever held tbh.  See what the next month brings.
I sure hope so. 500 shares in my IRA and I want it to make me a millionaire
Nvidia GTC from nov 8-11, earnings on 16th. Took profits on a 10 bag fd expiring 11/5 today and all-in on calls until after earnings
I bought 11/12 300C this morning at $125 and sold them at $940 near 1PM EST. If I just held an hour longer they turn into $2200 a contract. Fucking bonkers man.
I can top you. I bought 20 267s for 2.5 yesterday and Sold them for 7 today. They went as high at 44. To add salt to the wound I didn’t sell my pypl and snap calls and open and lost 80% of my gains for the day. Textbook example of selling winners early and holding losers.
Damn dude, at least you came out with some profit. Normally I sell my winners super early too…
we both kind of suck don’t we :)
What strike/exp you like?
Got 1 11/19 $315C near market close for $9.48, but I think that's playing it safe. I'm praying for a red day tomorrow in which I'll buy more 11/19 calls in a spread at 10-25% out of the money.

If earnings are good I wouldn't be surprised if it reaches $370 by the end of the month
I remember a certain porn video where a guy puts his bald head inside. Like fisting but with his head
You guys watch some weird kinks.
Yo… I was just thinking about this the other day and asked my friends about it and they all acted like I was insane… Had me doubting myself and like it was a fever dream or some shit
That girl died
Yeah I heard the guy died due to suffocating
Dude. I remember this video
Yeah this was around 2010. Never realized how popular it was
I watched it in college. I’m a chick and was like wtf? How does that idea even happen? I mean, I probably masturbated but not a proud one
> You're a woman?
Where’s the sauce though

Edit: just found it 😊
I really hate the cunts who drag race on my street at night. Every time I hear sirens I hope that one of them has wrapped their car around a tree.
I’m Amish -we sometimes drag race our horse and carts - I hope it not offends thee
It’s true , I was the guy drag racing on his street at night.
You must be my neighbor. Do me a favor and fuck yourself in the 🅱️ussy with that soda can you must have strapped to your exhaust.
I hope you live in Columbus because it's literally every fucking night here
Yep
UT… they all meet at the Autozone down the street and jerk each other off before racing. They wake me up once or twice a night.
Lost 2.5k since I got back in. Maybe I shouldn't do this anymore
Just win back 5k
I did before then lost it again. Thought I learned better
Literally how? Everything going up
Visa
Oof, sorry mate
Calls are for March at least so hopefully should be some recovery
So are mine. I have been exiting them for small profit though. Visa is not loved anymore. Look at longer timeline chart. Look at valuation too.  It should be an easy win but it isn’t. I recommend you get out as well. 


Some of the insurance companies do well this quarter like SLQT and GOCO. The pet insurance company trupanion did well. Travelers insurance is doing good. Etc. just stay off of property insurance. 


TSLA always good. Light speed got hammered. Not sure if recovery is likely but you could explore that. 


Msft always good.
F
I know gains/losses are very relative but thats not a lot. Easily can make that back
Just buy shares retard
My opinion on the market? Spy 470 tomorrow.
SPY 490 EOY ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
500
I pray that’s the case. Regardless bullish af ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
500 easy EOY. I raise you 508.69

You younger guys need to get blown off by about 200+ chicks and then it won’t phase u anymore. Just move on. No one is that special. Chicks like to blow guys off. They get tons of attention because they are young. It’s what they do. Don’t worry life catches up w them. Meanwhile you’ll age like wine and be on your yacht w a 22 yr old
Aren't you the guy who got catfished and then ghosted by some girl who didn't give you the time of day, then stayed for more
Hooters girl? Idk maybe she was hot but was fucking others and just wanted to fuck her. Didn’t catch feelings
She stood you up and you sent her a text that said "Hey, if you do that 3 more times I might seriously consider leaving!"
Don’t be a troll. I don’t let chicks fuck w me
I have the screenshots srry saw it live
Where do you meet your chicks
Grinder
Ram Ranch
In person, online, Instagram whatever
Shoulda learned to play the guitar
Shoulda learned to play them drums

Guys. Sorry for invading your male space every time I'm here.
Man spaces have room for everyone, but it is unreasonable to expect a man dominated space to change to accommodate for non-men.
I know but idk if asking people to tone down on posting/linking (to actual) porn is asking too much.
it's a girl! I'm gonna reply. I don't really have anything to say tho.

“For anyone wondering Nvidia $NVDA would hit a $1T market cap around $401 👀” - StockMKTNewz on Twitter
Did not start this month off thinking NVDA would be in the talks for the next x1k unicorn company
Me neither, I only bought bc Nancy went in on calls and she almost never misses
Nvda has literally been green every single day, I was like holy shit I should buy calls lmao and boy did they print. Now it’s gonna get dumped. Nvdas first red day in two months tomorrow confirmed
Lol who was the guy that said PTON earnings were priced in? Yikes
> I think you mean PTON earnings were priced in.
Damn I should’ve bought more PTON puts
Lmao. Uber call holders
PTON go sheep sheep
I swear to go my earning plays never work out. I buy Roku calls, it drills. I buy pins puts, it moons.
Pins is a silent FB. They print money and no one knows. Like they make more money then the cartels combined and no one understands exactly what the revenue model is other then ads but whatever it is every photo based app tries to mimic it.
PINS hasn't reported yet have they?
I'm not sure. But much like the house of mouse. Don't fuck with them.

They wield the power of Facebook, Palantir, and Tesla combined. 

They are so "don't fuck with me" Chuck Norris just gives them a hat tip and keeps walking.
SPY 469 1dte calls before close? Of course
Glad I’m not the only one thinking that
Let’s go rkt
PTON puts were the play  😔
All that CNBC pumping of PLTON ain't helping it out. This one ded
UBER reports profit for the first time and still down lol
UBER's definition of "Profit":  EPS of -1.28 per share.
These early pandemic winners all getting slaughtered
Portnoy is ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5958)
wtf I FUCKING KNEW it 

as soon as i locked in gains on rkt calls it goes into outer space AH 

FUCK
Oh god does this mean my long dead UWMC calls have a chance to follow it? Redemption is at hand?
I’m still holding calls but I’ve learned not to celebrate until market open the next day
I still have 400 shares so I’m not too upset 

jk IM LIVID
Still livid? Back down to close 🙃 I hate earnings
wew dodged a bullet
i don't know what you're looking at but a 50 cent move up followed by drop of the same size isn't something I'd be regretful of missing
> outer space

> up 2%

Yea ok guy
🦀 **PELOTON IS DED** 🦀
A treadmill ate them
$SQ absolutely schitzo right now
Whose buying more nvda money printer calls tomorrow?
Me
Money maker, safe play at least before earning
sq doesnt know which way i wants to go with its earnings lmao
Hopefully a good sign.
All I'm seeing is volatility evaporating and cashing out my sold call.
$SQ has nowhere to go but 300+, once the dust settles.  Q4 numbers will be huge, with shopping reopening.
I feel sick waiting for NET to fuck me
Me too haha
Is NET going to dump or am I taking a toaster bath tonight
All common logic says it should pull back a little and that's coming from someone who's been holding it for years. But we said that at 100 and look where we are now.
Dkng big day tomo after discounted contracts today
RKT earnings?
Airbnb, I called that. Earnings wasnt bad at all
why the fuck is it zig zaging all over the place?
Other sharing economy companies like Uber didn't do well so people are fearful
Holyfuck wtf is going with ABNB? That drop and then that fucking rocket!
Beat all around
Square profits!?
SQ giving me heart palpations on my PYPL position.
Eps was ok actually, I think it's gonna run tomorrow
F's in the chat
Which joker here bought put for net?
lmao i wanted to thought it was free money too expensive tho. glad i didn’t fuck
Both PTON and VMEO in my portfolio are down 20+% today. How fucked am I?
Big fuk.
I would say large-size fucking
I can’t handle this anymore lmao…..
PTON to announce new electric... treadmills...
Do they run themselves?
Damn, how many kids killed by PTON this Q?
SQ earnings was fine, that being said still more bullish on PayPal because they’ve proven their guidance for the next few years and are trading 5 times cheaper than square. Visa and paypal are better buys until squares valuations come to reality. It will only take one bad earnings call with square for it to go down 30% in one session.
How bad was it?
I’d say it was pretty average for square. I think square has upside for next year even at current prices. Prolly gunna go over 300 if they continue to have good guidance next year.
Did RKT hit or miss?
10 min till earnings call right?
lol once upon a time PTON was worth $170
Where is the guy with $PTON puts? Hopefully on his way to a steak house rn .
Remeber when pton was $170, pton bulls got slaughtered
Square is like an addict - get depressed - get high - come down - maybe die?
I told Santa I wanted to buy PTON at $50. 

Amazing. Thanks Santa.
Theres no way NET stays above 200
Z puts and TSLA calls
Looks like SPY is on the biggest one month gain since the gain post COVID crash
Yeah here I am laughing at the PTON tards while shitting myself that APPN is gonna report a truckoad of garbage in half an hour's time and I'll see my 100k become 50 :o
Ok NET enough of this run. Drop 10% tomorrow so i might load up
Why is SQ 112 B market cap? I just looked at their earnings
Pick a direction ABNB
That one brief second where NET hit $220 was what dreams were made of
I almost shit myself but not in a good way. The bad way of shitting.
I got juked out ngl
NET not dumping at least 10% is a welcome surprise. Lol
Abnb smashed earnings
Who bought at the top?
Not me, that's for sure.

I bought at the very top.
Don't you fuck me RKT.
I’m getting IV fucked tomorrow
NET just popped to 220 then down to 195 then back to 215 now around 203 - Market is seriously broken
+3 Meta 12/3 $345 calls and +1 SPY 11/22 $470 call
👀looking for other WFH plays with upcoming earnings to get crushed like PTON
Guess who decided to get SQ calls over PTON puts 🤡
Bought draft kings call for tomorrow. Grabbed a longshot Nvidia call for tomorrow too lol. Let's see how it plays out.
*checks PTON
“Alexa, play How Low By Ludacris”
Who else sold their 12/17 $65 PTON puts? Just me? Oh...
I had a CAR call pre earnings and sold when things slid down 🤡
Ooof. Thanks for making me feel better about selling off my PTON puts and QCOM calls due to fomc fud

Luckily spy calls and a random nvda call from the start of the day still have me way up thank god
Did I just cash advance my CC to avg down on Pton
Carvana lost $479 mil in q3, selling used cars when we’re seeing all time high prices.

I went to the gym and come back to see that my PINS puts are gonna be fucked. Good thing I only bought 2
What is up with the obvious shit stocks finally plunging after earnings?  You know like PTON
wtf gas went up like 30 cents today
Smoked it all
Yes
RKT excels at taking money from wsb investors.
Buy more Lucid
Well fuck, RKT beat earnings, guess that means I’m dying in a fire
That means stock goes down baby!!
anyone else getting real nervous about the market going up indefinitely?
No
October was the worst month I’ve had all year and today NVDA just saved my portfolio 🙏🏻
RKT earnings were truly priced in. Was sitting at 0.0% change from close as I went to type this.
should have bought more pton puts
Well rkt makes it 7 wrong guesses in a row...on a 50/50  pick how did I pick 7 wrong guess in a row....time for a 3rd job boys
Buying calls is 15% success , selling puts is 85% success
$Net really said fuck your puts
And your calls
Holy shit Ford doing its thing after hours. PTON puts and F Calls at open today make for a Good Friday
What happen to peloton is it doing a split tonight?
it’s trying

I’ve got an insane chest pump going right now. Heck yeah
MRNA - Miss. PTON - Miss. AAPL - Miss. AMZN - Miss. SNAP - Miss. FB - Miss on Revenue. NASDAQ Composite? Up 10% on the month. What is different here? 🤔
> The difference here is that the market has already priced in a lot of bad news. The tax bill will be passed, which means lower corporate taxes and more money for companies to play with. Companies are also sitting on huge piles of cash they can use to buy back stock or pay out dividends, so I think you'll see some nice moves from tech stocks this year.
Proof that algos are ~~trained~~ programmed to BTFD.

Edit: caught myself using sentimental language...This bot is good.
Visual Mod - I love you but NASDAQ is up 35% YTD. This is not "Bad news" being already priced in.
Damn VisualMod you scary
And SQ miss, and Z falling off a cliff, and CHGG miss/cliff, and PYPL being down a fair bit lately. I wonder if not for TSLA where Nasdaq would be.
Lowe’s doesn’t allow dogs but Home Depot does.
Lowe’s sucks ass. I worked there and management other than the head store managers suck. None of them want to do their jobs and nobody wants to be there.
penn calls on portnoy news?
NVDA leaps are on the table, but they’re so damn expensive 😩
Pton deserves it for all those child hungry treadmills
RKT sounds like they beat earnings, and it drills. Id like to pick something before earnings that moons for once.
You need a surprise beat. Not just a regular beat.
Hmm. Didn't think of it like that.
Or 3 holes and a heartbeat. Need to lower your standards if you gonna duck with RKT.
$F looking like it wants $20 in AH
I’m breaking up with SQ. This is worse than the red wedding.
Square a bitch. Might buy some more tomorrow to show her who’s boss..
Dint know what happened at earnings? Its a nice stock!
Fuck I’m poor now. I only have $1300.
I had over $900 goin into the day. Thought I'd do myself a little day trade on TSLA at about 1130. Proceeded to get absolutely fucking destroyed in 5 minutes and sold at the bottom like a bitch. Halved my monies in one day. 😔🙌
have a feeling these NVDA puts are gonna print hard in the morning....

Both RKT and UWMC have been morbid.  Housing prices need to drop.

Bruh RKT beat earnings (0.57 vs 0. 48(expected)) and it still tanks.
And 3.12bn revenue vs 2.96 expected. They smashed earnings
Nvda calls in the morning, puts at 11
So NET puts were a waste …
Fuck the gay bears. Dont doubt the Prince.
OXY smashes earnings and rips up a whole quarter. WOOOOO

Why is NVDA going up so much?
They have what people want, and people want their stock because of that, and other people want their stock because of that.
Tell me why I shouldn’t buy coin
Every single time someone here (mostly bots) tells you to buy <ticker> or stay poor, it's either a pump and dump or they need someone to buy their very heavy bags
[deleted]
Lmao. Nah I’m a real person
Cause it was 100 a share cheeper last month.
Yeah and it was $25 cheaper 4 days ago. But does that mean it’ll go down after earnings in the morning?
Not sure i am at 240 and holding
You want to stay poor so you can keep slumming it in here ( damn the guy above is on to me )
I’m sold 👍🏻
[deleted]
Is he complaining today?
You could say that.
[deleted]
This is a buy the dip opportunity. Scandals don’t affect the fundamentals of the business
[deleted]
Worth being down on earnings sure, but the company had a profitable quarter even with Delta variant affecting the business. The move down in the stock is not all fundamentals, a lot to do with the scandal.
Doing the thing that even though you had a winning trade you tell yourself “should’ve bought more…” 

Hallucinations of lambos and silicon breasts soon to follow.
That or selling too early because you didn't expect the stock to run up another 30 dollars after open.
NKLA up 21% today. That's the world we're in rn. Let that sink in
I put my whole portfolio into it yesterday. it's the shorts covering it.  it's a 5 billion dollar valued business. any small amount of good news at this point is going to rocket it just like GameStop did.
Hard to imagine there is still the that many believer’s. Lol
When my nkla fds did better then my tsla fds today. GUH
Great. I was hoping $PINS would have a big earnings day, like 30% upside.

Congrats on those who had Peloton puts. I knew I shouldn't have been a p\*\*\*\* and just jumped on those.
i was a believer in PTON, but after today's earnings im done with PTON. this stock showed negative growth when its entire valuation is literally tied to growth. their fitness subscription growth is the only increase so far but this is like 300M in total rev which is nothing. this stock is fucked bad

Feeling good about my single F leap and Jan CHegg call.
Jan Chegg calls actually sound pretty good
Made a nice profit on my SPY calls I think I’ll buy more next week
Anyone playing bullish on COIN earnings?
I don’t see how they don’t beat earnings. I think they have a lot of debt though and they have insiders recently selling tens of millions and n shares. Seems dangerous.
Priced in. People have been saying this for weeks. Inverse these retards.
Yeah buts run up so itll probably drop imo

Puts on Amazon!  My dogs leash broke on our run today and she charged off after a pack of deer for 20 minutes.  I'm looking at the broken clip and it's an incredibly shit way to build a steel piece that perfectly hides how shit it is (essentially instead of machining or stamping out the flare that keeps the two separate pieces together they appear to have just used a low quality weld covered by thick but weak plating)

My dog is a husky so her recall sucks when prey is around and she didn't come back till she took out a chunk of deer hide but otherwise she is safe at least.

Also the giant muscular buck was the first to book it out of there and left the doe to fend for themselves.  A true king.
My dogs chase deer all the time they have no chance at catching them it’s great exercise as long as the make it back safe.
She probably wouldn't have caught the dumb fuckers either but they kept crashing through the brush instead of running straight and she can slip through way easier than them and jumps like she is a cat.
My female is a Catahoola she’s bread for  herding and hog hunting. Fast like you wouldn’t believe. And she has no chance
Apparently my deer just suck shit at running away.
There retarded they belong here
One time my pit bolted for a squirrel and the leash snapped and it came back and whipped me in the neck with the broken metal end
Use a slip leash or harness.
Harness wouldn't have helped.  She didn't even pull that hard when it broke.   Slip leash would have and we have one but I had here on a 15 foot leash because we were running near water and it let's her swim.   The previous one never broke in 3 years but was getting tatrered and rusty.  New one lasted 3 months.

GOOG give me a 1% gain day tomorrow plz
Planning on holding my F $19 11/12 calls, bought at $0.29 now it’s $0.94
Good luck. I bought some 11/5 20c and sold them. It's been consistent but Ford tends to dip and then slowly climb back up.
If I'm playing earnings I'd rather have a trade go 100% against me than get theta cucked

So ABNB and UBER just gonna do nothing AH

There’s a health/tech stock I’m not allowed to mention that’s up 30% post market after reporting earnings and has 30% SI, could get interesting tomorrow morning.

You have a better basis than me.  There may be another pop at earnings next week if they say anything positive about efforts to get the vax into North America
Where’s the split the big TSLA bears were hyping up

Oh wait
What do you think the year-end market trajectory looks like?

Seems like the Santa rally started early this year, as the market tends to put in a short-term bottom around Halloween according to historical seasonality averages: https://images.mktw.net/im-423378?width=770&height=524

1) Market goes parabolic all the way through EOY; ends around 5000 (25% chance?)

2) Market consolidates around 4650-4700 for a few weeks before EOY rally to 4800-4900 (35% chance?)

3) Small pullback in mid/late November to 4500-4600, then healthy Santa Claus rally to 4800-4900 (35% chance?)

4) Market sells off more substantially (4300-4400s; can’t see lower than that), but what could possibly cause this? Debt ceiling? Democrats will raise on their own. Job/inflation numbers running hot? Won’t matter to Wall St unless FOMC accelerates tapering/tightening, but Powell doesn’t have the spine to do that (5% chance)
straight up with the usual pullbacks around opex days.
I'd bet #3

I’ve seen 7 people on TV saying “we have tools” or “we can use powerful tools” just today alone. I see JPOW “the tool man” Taylor is rubbing off on everyone. Whenever someone asks me something I don’t know the answer to I’m just going to say that and people will automatically think I’m legit.
I was thinking this today when I read about OPEC+.

Who’s playing dkng tomorrow? I’ve got it drilling like Chegg and peloton
I am deep in it and a little scared but scared money dont make money
Fuck how do u deal with the fact that you paper handed 2 trades that Both had 100% returns today for a mere 20% and loss of 10%
mf the same way i deal with selling for 150% and they go on to run for 3000%, 

keep it moving
Ya. I took a break from trading for the day to cool emotions. Getting ready for Tom I think.
100% is basically 5% nowadays
Honestly big true. I feel like this shit getting a little crazy or honestly I’m just seeing way more. (Maybe appearance bias)
Look forward not backward. With options you gotta be willing to ride em to 0 to make those massive gains
Tomorrow is a new day, filled with possibilities. Which crayon will you need, will you cry, will you have to call your bank or your wife's boyfriend, only time will tell.

Been loading on VIAC under $40. Eventually it will return to $50. But damn is it taking it's time.
The buy button on VIAC is jammed - that stock just never stops going down
I don't really care any more at this point. It has too solid of a future in digital media, and with growth it's already generating for me to view it as a typical value stock trap. That shit can drag down sub-30 and I know I'll be right eventually.

You would think something like PTON would be traceable with credit card data and other real time info that the hedge funds can get … and it still got clobbered

What’s the play on Facebook/meta? Leaps? Wait for a dip?
I'm doing far ITM leaps for Jan 2023. Already up 15% this week. In the long run it'll be about 3x the growth the shares will do. But really there is no wrong way to go long on FB. I think we'll rise steadily into the Dec 1st ticker name change and then possibly see some pull back. 2022 should be great for META.
> The stock is overvalued. I recommend selling now and buying back at a lower price.
How can you be a visual mod if I can’t see you?

AFRM had a nice dip after PTON earnings miss
What's the relation between AFRM and PTON?
PTON used to be AFRM's biggest customer.  Not sure if that's still true in light of AFRM 's other recent deals
No fucking clue. I’m just parroting what someone else said.
Down 4% AH. Feck!
Peloton is Affirm’s biggest client and accounts for a large portion of their total sales
That's interesting. I thought those who buy PTONs would be the type to not pay in installments.
I just want to know if AMZN tries to break it's year long channel.
I like it man  but 3500 is a serious test
Pton better pull off a partnership with onlyfans next q

Hoping that straddle pays out?
Nah I’ve got puts but it’s a small play I cashed out some today so pretty much all house money. I think it’s going to dive like a lot of other spacs have been. If you look at Chegg and peloton they both formed head and shoulders on the 5 yr draft king has the same and they also don’t make a profit and too many people are bullish is kinda my reasoning

transferring all my funds to my cash account so no mo day trade bans for me😎
I’ve been split between a margin and a cash account which has been super helpful. Finally over 25k so I’m gonna open a new account at a real brokerage with fees and shit for the better fills and other tools.
that’s smart, I’ve been thinking about that too actually. best of both worlds. congrats tho brother
Thanks buddy! Definitely consider keeping two accounts. Having the cash account to day trade in and the margin account for swings/spreads/etc. Having to wait for cash to settle can fuck you just as bad as PDT. Worth considering.
Yeah, that’s so true. If I may ask, what kind of spreads do you usually run? I’m still new to options so I’ve just been doing basic calls and puts. still saving up to buy 100 shares of something decent to start selling calls for
I mean, I’m not a super complicated trader but I’ll do credit spreads if IV is really high (sell put credit spreads if I’m bullish or call credit spreads if I’m bearish), or debit spreads if it’s something crazy expensive like amazon or Google and I want something close to the money without spending thousands. I messed around with some iron condors once but honestly the level of complexity involved in putting on multi-leg options plays properly is beyond me for now.
PTON wrecked! Anybody have puts?

Johnny Walker Blue label

WhistlePig 18 year reserve

Yamazaki 18 year
Adding these to the list
I enjoy Basil Hayden’s
Aberlour A'bunadh good sherried scotch. Def best crowd pleaser whiskey, that I'd use to treat somebody to great whiskey.

Ardbeg varieties for peated scotch.

Lagavulin 16 popular on the peated front as well.

Eagle rare for bourbons IMO. Not exactly top shelf price tho.

Been wanting to try the new Jack Daniels 10yr myself. Hard to get though.

I’ll give these a shot, I love a deep smoky taste

They told people's to stockpile food in gyna, covid 21 gonna be lit!
Fuck yes.  Ngl, repeat of Mar 20 would be fucking awesome
Covid is still a thing? This could only mean the market will double by next Summer. 

Covid was the most bullish thing that could've happened to the market.
Shouldn't be but why tell ppl to stockpile and prepare
Maybe more due to the prices of literally everything increasing due to global shipping issues. Even Dollar Tree is raising prices to above $1 on a lot of their items.

#Nikola is up 45% in the past month.....

While. Men. Slept.
Gravity must have had a stronger pull
And here I am, -45% in the past month
So ZM earnings per share have decreased for the last 3 quarters, and their revenue has decreased for the last 4 quarters. Yet they are still over 4x what they were at the onset of the pandemic. With covid pretty much over and fewer and fewer people able to work from home, what does everyone think about puts for their earnings later this month? 

On the one hand it does seem to be priced in seeing as how they are about 50% below ath. On the other hand, look at pton on their earnings today. Could something similar happen to zm? 

Full disclosure, I fucking hate zm. I lost my ass holding puts on them when they had earnings in the summer of 2020 and I would love to see the whole company go down in flames. I'll never forget watching them go from like -5% to positive ah that earning when they first broke $200/share.
Well look at other COVID stocks still bouncing off the moon, like NVDA and NET.  


I would wait it out. There's nothing but downside risk with the FED tapering and inflation raging.
Yeah they’re gonna get rekt
find another tech company that tanked in this field. I think Cisco went up a few percent, most recent is PayPal which I don’t even consider tech and SNAP which is very tech
MMM will explode tomorrow with any news about the infrastructure bill. Be prepared
Too late to buy?
It fell 2 points yesterday because of a North Carolina ruling, I just bought the dip and some two weeks out calls in case voting gets delayed
IWM futures up 4.20 points

All in PLTR before earnings. Good or bad idea?
Depends, what is your view on money?
Sell covered calls, buy puts, sell the puts at $22, sell CSP, buy calls

Finally jumped off the spy put chase and cashed on Chewy calls!!! Anyone else riding theirs through tomorrow?
Cathie is about to blow up another of her hedge funds.

Good luck growth and disruptive tech, we hardly knew ye.
Can't lie. Still in disbelief NET didn't tank. Calls on my portfolio.
Nice, did you have calls/shares?
Yeah, I got 1k shares at a cost basis of around 65. I hedged the whole position on Friday instead of selling because it was cheaper than paying the taxes after this run up. I was totally expecting it to go back to like 170ish.
Lmao I had 170 Puts and was planning to hold through ER but I needed the cash for something else today so I sold last minute at a slight profit.
Retards. Why you think net has to blow up? Do you even read what that company does?
It's had like a 100% run up in a month and growing revenue 50% YoY. I just expected the normal earnings ramp and sell the news.
super bullish stocks get even more bullish after good earnings
I've had my position for about 16 months and they've had a couple painful sell offs after earnings that were just as strong. This run up was by far the fastest. I love the company, I'm happy to eat the hedge cost I spent on earnings.
My dog’s farts are making my eyes water.

Sideways? Bruh zoom out. Look at that massive downtrend. Also leaps meaning literally 1-2 years. More than enough time especially with how PC’s are more and more popular.

I don't think that NET earnings report was what the last batch of call buyers was looking for.  Wouldn't be surprised to see it collapse tomorrow
It *should*.  But I'm cynical that it *will*.

At this point it seems to be hijacked by greedy longs that refuse to sell, momentum pushers, short traders fighting for tiny little scraps of a dip, and big algo-funds that set higher and higher price floors to ensure it doesn't fall.
Every tech seems to possess a good side and a bad side. Social media connects people but causes envy, negative emotion, and lowers your attention span. Nuclear power in both energy and bombs, explosives in mining and war, toxic chemicals required for most advanced tech, manufacturing gives us cheaper stuff but releases dangerous pollutants, etc are all examples of how sometimes the solution can cause as much damage or more than the problem it’s solving.
as long as tech stocks go up forever, it's all good
There are no upsides to social media, there are no downsides to nuclear energy. No, I will not elaborate.
Eh I think a social marketplace is a good idea. I contrasted nuclear power giving us the (good) energy and (bad) bomb.

Tried to scan recent buys from politicians but didn't find anything interesting, nvda leaps already got too expensive for me.

The case for Ford.  1.  I like the Mach e mustang.  2.  I like the 7500 tax credit.  3.  Big investment  in Rivian which is going public next week..  "In the event Rivian completes an IPO, Ford will record any gain on its investment in Rivian and subsequent adjustments as special items. Accordingly, Ford will recast its pre-IPO non-cash adjusted EBIT gain of about $900 million from the first quarter of 2021 as a special item" . 4.  I like the movie Ford v. Ferrari
Where do people charge the mustang thing?
tesla sells adaptors for EVS to charge on their superchargers

EDIT, their reg chargers, not the Supercharger but elon says hes working on it
I saw a youtube vid where the mustang could only charge on 3rd party chargers and they were all broken.
i love ford, but man do they always got problems on 1st launches on anything. 2015 mustang was literally paper Mache,
Yeah ive owned several Fords. The one thing they do is last. Other than that...its not great.
You charge it in 240v plug in your house.  Near me there are also some public charging stations
Yeah its all 3rd party slow chargers?

I work from home so I work out during the day on my lunch,etc. I don’t have to go anywhere. I work a job where I’m on call so I just work out randomly since it’s best I don’t leave home during those hours.
What do you like about the device tho. Why a peleton and not something else
I think I realized that I needed some sort of motivating factor. It’s gotten really easy for me to just say fuck it and half ass a workout. An instructor helps me keep going. I don’t particularly have a direct reason for peloton directly, somewhat of an impulse buy. If that’s the key you’re looking for

I'm thinking of doing some long Ford calls, maybe $30 a year from now.

Just get real close and turn your left blinker on, Eastern Europe style
Fuck you too. This is my lane now.
Get back on your PTONs, wtf is wrong with you all
I go outside to ride a bike like a normal person
Come on RKT. Take me to $50
all in on NVDA.. i got high hopes for $325 by close tmrw
yeah i got "high hopes" too lol like my account is blown if we don't see that
That would make my fucking weekend.
Tesla bought me a new snowmobile
Just wait until neurolink comes out. Shit is going to pluto

I fucking hate the stock market. How is it possible to buy 3 different stocks this Monday and ALL 3 stocks have 3 red days in a row? While SPY is pumping to no end. Fuck me sideways.
> You're a fucking idiot.
I sure am
Just buy SPY calls dumbass
Too late. As soon as I buy, we’ll at least have 3 red days in a row. I don’t wanna do that to you guys.
My hero ❤️
Tell me NVDA is going to $330 tomorrow..
NVDA is going to $330 tomorrow
I might close my margin account if it doesn’t
if it doesn't i just blew up 30k so uh....
          🚀
      🚀
   💥
You're fucked
PTON puts printing tomorrow 🤑🤑
Sell around 1 or 2 PM and then re-open during the next few days
My printer is loaded up and ready to go.
Hard
God wish I had gotten more than 1 but I’m good with it
Win is a win brother
Unless you have a hilarious video of a midget getting strangled to share, I don’t want to hear a god damn thing about another short squeeze..
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

This was so wholesome…at first…
Kicking myself for not buying PTON puts before close
Oh my lord I just downloaded the ToS desktop app and I have no clue what I’m looking at but this countdown to open has me hype
lmao the mobile is cool but desktop looks pretty clean, took a min to look for shit on there but you get so much information its insane
You can copy and paste options into a chart to see price history fyi
That’s exactly why I downloaded it! Blew my mind
Well, that blew my mind. Thank you, dude.
It doesn't do 🎉🎊 or 🚀🚀🚀 

But other than that it's pretty good
Thats when i asked myself defuq you doin trynna play mr wallstreet
There’s a bell at open too 🥰
Just papertrade it for a while so you don’t lose everything sooner than you already would
I didn’t just open an account dumbass, I normally trade on the mobile app or through TDA’s website.
Having a tda account for any length of time and not downloading ToS makes you the dumbass
Not really, I don’t trade much on my desktop.
Wasn’t intended to be taken seriously. But, I think the ToS mobile app is better than the tda app ass well
Yeah idk if I’m going to use it much for trading but for analysis and charting it seems really nice, lot of info and being able to look at the options price history is awesome.
Yeah, it’s also cool that you can set it up to send alerts to your phone if it reaches a certain price (option or stock)
Mobile app is much easier to navigate…but I’m surprised you find anything on it. Your wife said you still haven’t found the clit.
Why are you so angry lmao, lose money today?
Up 5% on the account today, so not a bad day.
PROG squeeze and or buyout next week 🤑🤑🤑

Who uses a peloton anyways, lift weights
I got a Peloton recently, I fucking love that thing. All the bitches love Pelotons. Also - lift
I do both on alternate days, it's great
Bought one during the pandemic b/c the gyms were closed.

It's been an expensive coat hanger in my guest room ever since
Well based upon their AH price movement, they’re about to be priced like a coat hangar company.
What about the peloton shoes that are required?
Any cycling shoes will do.  You can either use the cleats for the Peloton pedals or swap out the pedals for your preferred ones.
Shit, no idea where they are

Controversial opinion, I think perhaps that women have, on a few occasions, potentially, made a few errors.

You’re the one who called his mother a dirty cum rag.

Why does he have a bunch of Beagles he’s bringing in with him?

It's going to keep dropping
Since I’ve made it this far into the year and I’m still not rich nor have I blown out my account, I think it’s time to go all in for the final round on 495 12/17 SPY calls

Seriously why isn’t this being talked about more? First thing I thought as well.
what if we are already in the Metaverse and we’ve run out of ideas so we’ve created another Metaverse within the Metaverse. Could possibly be multiple levels of Metaverses and we are just stuck in a loop at this point
Stuck with the zuck in the cuckaverse. Bullish
Then it wouldn’t matter because it’s clear we’ve developed the capacity to erase memory.
You win some you lose some, mostly you lose though.
But for sure you also lose some more after that. We are so regarded that bend the reality and we lose more than we gain

Nvda is next tesla 

I am making nvda to 1T dollar. Join the train, fuk musk he screwed up
What he do now? 😂 how’d he screw up
Tweets trash shit.
He soon put tesla high price
*Up $30 on a call* 
I’m printing!!!!
The Tesla bubble is going to take the entire market down with it
when tho? today, tomorrow, in 5 years?
Wish I had the answer to that question. My money is 75% on the sidelines until it happens though
I’ve been doing this for a year. Don’t be like me. Yolo it into spy and never look at it again
![img](emote|t5_2th52|5958)
RemindMe! 1 year
I had that attitude. But guess what, missed doubling my money because of it. Even if there is a 50% set back, I would have made more going in
Hey I wish I had stayed in longer, but in the long run I'll take the risk averse strategy. Nobody ever lost money taking a profit
Glad I’m enjoying the ride
the entire market turned retarded once October hit
Yoo my spy 466 calls about to make me a bag wtf!!! I'm selling at open fuck that!!!!
imagine being cathie wood. You are buying hyperspeculative tech growth stocks in the greatest bubble of all time and you are only breaking even because your biggest holding is a trillion dollar meme

GME was a blessing and a curse.

Crazy how you could have played the same ticker and strikes as Pelosi and you’d be up like 500%.

But since GME people are chasing 46667% gains, trying to become millionaires over night with like $2,000.

I personally know people who refuse to sell at 100% gains. And there’s degenerates here holding onto positions til expiration only to sell for a loss.

Fintwit and social media stock gurus are the snake oil salesmen of the 21st century.
You can lead a retard to DD, but you can’t teach him to read.
Thank you sir. I needed this and I love you.
Its insane. I feel like some of these people are just truly uneducated and or actually retarded lol
Not wrong. Those reports about the gamification of trading nowadays isn’t too far off either.
Had my first 1800% gain today on nvda, was quite nice
I’ve made 2.7 million buying and selling GME. Yeah the apes suck. But it’s been one of the most volatile stocks all year.

Internet tard-coins are 100% going to be the catalyst for the next crash. Every tech company now is adding this shit to their balance sheet trying to stay competitive and not miss out. Earnings calls for many of these companies now are “did internet coins go up or down? There’s your answer. Check back next quarter to also see if they went up or down.”
It’s all been so much free money this year idk how people are losing money on it, I’m probably gonna get out soon
It’s not even the value of the coins themselves. Robinhood’s earnings for instance were a complete disaster because of a coin that was created as a complete joke, that people all of a sudden stopped trading as interest evaporated overnight. If your company’s success or failure is based on something that wildly speculative and volatile, you might as well just be running a roulette wheel.
Oh without a doubt, that entire market is propped by leverage and cooked books on a internet Chinese front, once it cascades shits getting sloppy
Lmfao yeah okay retard
Lol at portnoy trying to spin the rape stuff as a coordinated short attack on PENN
I believe women
I believe penn earnings sucked regardless
All of em? Not a single liar.
Look up Shawn Oakman
Of course there are rare circumstances. Duke Lacrosse and Oregon Basketball among them. But the cost:benefit analysis of a woman making that shit up is terrible for her. So it’s exceedingly rare.
Especially considering the fact that some people in society will still look at the rape victim as a slut/had it coming. I feel like it will be a true allegation a large percentage of the time.
I’d guess more than “some”
I’d say 99% don’t lie or are silent
Man I wanna quit this slave work. Why am I one of the unlucky ones. I don't wanna work till my 40s man wtf.
40s? What about the rest
That when he's gonna rope

This "everything is fine with China" regarding the real estate stuff feels just like "everything is fine with China" regarding COVID did last year

Z -We fucked up - 20% selloff  
CHGG- We met expectations not sure of next year - 50% selloff and FUCK YOU.  
RDFN- We've never been profitable and we fucked up a little this quarter - HOOOORAAAY! HOLD!
Chegg is useless in a non virtual world.  People can’t cheat in front of professors so makes sense it lost half its value.  They’re praying for another outbreak of the plague.
I went to college virtually before it was cool. CEO's guidance was a little unsettling but still not worth a 50% selloff. Exams are useless anyway.
this is such a dumb comment, everyone used chegg before classes were online, I just graduated
First, Congratulations! I doubt everyone used chegg just because you knew some people who used it.  And the stuff people use chegg for that generates their profits during the pandemic was gated behind a paywall.  when I used chegg while in school I was able to find what I needed without paying.
Wonder how many bag holders there are at 160 for a bike with an ipad attached to it
Thoughts on META (FB)? I think 400 soon. 500 by next year.
Listened to smart people talking about how the metaverse will be exponentially more difficult to moderate content than current Facebook and the shitstorm they’re trying to outrun right now is pretty huge.
I’d actually like to hear about that or see a link to something for reading. Thanks broski <3

Y'all ready for maximum tard strategy to reach $1MM?
  
Take $100. Throw it in a meme call at 10:00 a.m. for a minute once all the opening fuss has calmed down and set exit strategy for 20% gain. Wait T+2 and then put your $120 into a new call. Do this 50 times successfully and you'll be pretty close to $1MM (pre-tax / fees). Fuck up and you'll only have lost $100. So simple you should all be rich. I'll report back next year with my huge winnings. Love you guys.
I prefer the double 1k 10 times method
If you start with $500,000 you only have to do it once.
Liquidity is a myth
Thank god or else this foolproof plan wouldn't work very well.
On most days this place has about 30-35k active users. Today at one point we were close to 100k active users. We are nearing the top folks. Prepare for a MASSIVE crash.

I’ll go cash this weekend you’ve scared me
No Nut November, Day 4... I'm hanging on but at what cost? I can't focus on anything, my mental wellbeing has deteriorated, physically I am week and can barely walk. If so much as a gently breeze hits my leg I get a raging boner for 30 solid minutes and I have to resist the urge to beat it down. I'm barely hanging on here and I feel like I might loose control! I called the 1-800-no-fap number but they put me on hold so I hung up.

Lmao that Barron’s article “Tesla is over valued we did the math”. Buddy no one cares
i know, they gotta learn their audience. they shoulda named it "Will your calls print?"

My plans tomorrow... getting laser eye surgery at noon.
Damn can you shoot lasers from them right away or does it take a couple weeks?

Do they still look like regular eyes or more like laser guns?

I always thought it would be cool to have laser yes. Enjoy them and be careful.
I am going the ones that look like the walking eye from Jonny Quest. Solid mat black with a hole in the center with a glowing red light.
best of luck
Your eyes will be forever sensitive around dust.
I am immune to dust. Dust is life.
That's not how laser eye surgery work. You'll feel like you're in Arrakis when a hint of dust hits.
Mmm native desert girls who drink their own pee
Why do you have to make it weird. :(
So I get to watch with my laser eyes?,
If worst comes to worst I already whittled my self a set of wooden prosthetic eyes.
Or you can rethink the pros and cons of getting a laser eye surgery..
Pro- if it goes wrong I can have wooden eyeballs.
That's not a pro and you know it. 😡
Con- I willl no longer look like a sexy Jeffrey Dahmer without my glasses, therefore may score less poontang.
Are you referring to the male serial killer..?
Yeah. Chicks dig him.
Probably most definitely the opposite.
I'm going to do so much fucking drugs this weekend it's disgusting

peloton down 30% what is this, crypto? thats what you get you bike riding motherfuckers get off the road.
Lol. Did you see some airline launched a partnership with them? Exercise videos in the sky! Can't wait to sit next to some idiot trying to exercise in their seat next to me.
not some airline, FUCKING DELTA. if someone stretches to a peloton video next to me i will piss all over them
I think pissing on your seatmate is one of  the planned exercises in the 2nd video series though...
Delta charges a surcharge if you want someone to piss on you
With all the elbow and leg room I always wondered what could be done with that.
To everyone’s surprise, people want to go back to gyms. Also, a stationary bike doesn’t need a subscription.
I have no idea why I’m paying for one, but I do
Spaghetti sucks
at least it’s wet
I have more respect for someone riding a bike down a busy road than I do someone riding an imaginary bike while watching TV. 

Also, ai know a number of people who ride bikes. I don't know anyone who has a fucking peloton. Lmao. Talk about a racket.
Pay attention folks. 

Stocks are giving max pain on earnings misses right now. Adjusting downward to pre covid adjusted for inflation when a company misses or even a hint of bad news. Tapering is not priced in, it’s just slowly being priced in. MAANG hasn’t been hit yet and may remain resilient but everything else is getting absolutely fucked.

I don’t like to play conspiracy theorist, but I believe Algos are configured to trigger large sells on any of these events right now with taper in consideration instead of selling everything at once. Profits are being taken. 

I’m considering keeping an eye on growth stocks that haven’t dumped yet and opening Shorts or puts near earnings heading into the new year. 

Not financial advice. Only invest what you’re willing to lose.

Options market summed up in poker terms:

FD OTM are the degen gamblers they lose 90% of the time 

Smart options players and theta gang are the grinders, they win more times then lose and make small but consistent profits 

Market makers are the casino who rake the pot and always makes money
Buy ATM calendar debits on Virtu, the public market maker and you get all three
I just checked futures and yeah, they still don’t matter.
Standing outside at 4:00 in the morning when it's 44° out and the fucking dog won't take a shit.  I guess it's better than him shitting as fast as my options do cuz we'd still be in the living room
Feels good out there. Don't blame your dog because you can't vibe with the november air.
Sounds like something my dog would say.. Braxton?

You better not shit on the floor since you didn't want to outside.
You better pick it up if I do.
Mine gets the shits occasionally and whines at 3am till I take him out then he acts like we are on a regular walk. IT'S NOT SNIFF AND STROLL TIME IT'S SHIT TIME YOU DICK!
I'm throwing 50k into 1240/1200 Put Debit Spreads that expire next week on TSLA today. Pray for me.

I’m tired of life. I am always losing
Hang in there Donny :)
Have you tried investing in a nice cheeseburger 🍔?
Poet
Try taking a break. Reflect and recharge. Hang in there!
Sleep is good.
If it's because of options plays stay away from them, or use only ITM LEAPs from now on. Take also a break and reflect on the trading mistakes you may have made so that you can avoid them in the future.
So stop
AMD and NVDA can't stop, won't stop!
The other night I had this weird fucking dream I was at the top of a very tall stone tower with two people. One was a friend, but I don’t remember who. The other was a guy I knew vaguely in high school I haven’t seen or spoken to in like well over a decade. 

We had to climb down, but I wouldn’t. I’m terrified of climbing in high places. I knew I would fall. We argued, I insisted they go on without me. They grabbed me, and dragged me by my legs towards the edge of the tower. 

For a moment I had the thought to fight them, I was panicking. Then a more clear thought came. *This is the way down.*

And they threw me over the edge. 

I remember falling, but I was calm. I do remember thinking to put my legs down so that there was a chance I just destroyed my legs on landing but survived otherwise. 

Then I hit the ground, and as you would all expect, woke up. In the dream though, at that last moment, I’m pretty sure I was alive, and unhurt. 

No idea what it means. 

Calls printed like a motherfucker the next day though.
Fucking hate those falling dreams
Still a dick move though
‘‘Twas scary
You should call them up and tell them about how bad what they did was. :)
Aren’t you not supposed to put your legs straight down because your femurs gets shoved into your chest?
Nah like just have my legs under me, I was falling like ass first on my back. I don’t mean like locking my legs straight lol.
Lmaooo bears immediately start downvoting everything
Holy shit I’m a fucking idiot
Acceptance is the first step my friend
Day 100 of waiting for a red spy day so I can buy calls again

I have the urge to kill myself everytime I see a “the shorts” comment on a stock in here
The shorts are shorting a bunch of stocks. The shorts.
ThE ShOrtS STiLL HaVenT CoVeReD Reeeeeee!
Shorts?

Nah, it's November and my chicken ass legs are cold
> I prefer not to wear shorts.
Shorts must cover
Stfu about that bitch
If Pton opens at 70 tomorrow. I will shove my cock in my neighbors gas tank
Mods! We have a bet here!
That's fine, just remember its NNN.
Bfd with dat micro pp
There was this beautiful little Swedish girl I used to fuck on and off for about a year.

We brought out the absolute worst out in one another, became petty, malicious, immature, etc. even though on our own we were each more or less pleasant, decent people. It was without a doubt the most toxic thing I've ever been a part of. The sex was fantastic though.

But every time we'd fuck I'd feel terrible afterwards. We'd get to fighting and I'd promise myself never again. My friends advised me time after time to stop seeing her. They laughed at my general retardation. It probably was pretty entertaining from the outside looking in. 

But it was hell for me, I was miserable. I knew it was fucked and should stop but inevitably in times of weakness, self-doubt, drunkenness, etc. she'd appear on the scene and we were at it again, fucking like coked up wildcats.

SPY 0dte's are like that beautiful little Swedish girl. I know I should stay away, but I just can't help myself.
Photos please
Tbh the sex is always the best with the worst people.
A girl that has one eye a lil off,, will be crazy as bat shit but....sex is awesome
It’s because they are missing a screw or nut and when you provide, all is good for the moment
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
And I wonder why she sleeps with my friends! ohhhh eyeyyyyyyaaaaaa
You should call her and see what’s she’s up to. Maybe it’ll be different this time
You know what, you're right. 

And if it's not different, then this will be the absolute last time, I swear.
It’s not you bro, it’s Swedes.
You know you're actually the third person to tell me that, starting to believe there might be some truth to it
upvote if you want to see another green day on NVDA, prove them haters wrong
Green month + year
GME clowns 🤡 on the front page saying “We GoINg to 1000” 

TSLA did it TWICE already fuck out of here with your hope and dreams will never happen
Apes get a +8% stock day and write 3 pages over how it's changing their life and how it's clearly going to +800%. 


For TSLA it's just called a Tuesday.
Apes are the worst shit ever
Yes 👍🏽
Where are your puts and banbet then?
PTON cycling backwards at light speed
RIP PTON

yet another covid play dying joining the ranks of CHGG PENN DKNG etc
Are there real life people who actually thought peloton was a real investment lmfao??? Wow, I bet they are the same people who shorted baba
SQ up or down pick one please
Lol having a fucking seizure.
It just went from 244 to 252 in 2 mins.
Volume is light
pton  puts in the morning that shit will crater all day
RIP Peleton. Made 25k last year and early this year buying calls any day the news talked about "corona getting out of control !" or "delta variant !!"
Coherent zero
NVDA volume was still 28million lower than September 4th, a nothing day that saw a -0.4% drop
September 4th wasn’t even a trading day
*2020
ABNB beat pre-pandemic numbers, best earnings on record for them. If they trade flat, buy calls in the morning immediately.
They beat and posted a huge profit. Hoping to see 190 tomorrow
Buy calls first thing!
Imagine having both PTON and MRNA in your portfolio. Imagine… ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Excluding super mega caps, SPY would be probably down in the last 6 months.
It's called the S&P 5 for a reason
You suck men off when you’re drunk 

I suck men off when I ~~want to~~ lose half my account balance in one week

We are not the same
Straight Up 💯💯
Calls on $PENN all in
I went soft with 15 calls. I will have regrats for not buying more.
I’ll be buying a fat stack tomorrow AM.
What strike/exp?
I’ll probably go 1/21/22 70C
Portnoy spit in a chicks mouth and the stock dropped 20%?
They dropped cause of bad earnings and forecast, lol.
Man, it’s a good thing I don’t own a company.
PTON is a pandemic stock, only thrived when everyone was locked up in their homes. Now people rather exercise at a gym. No way would i touch the stock at this point
Fuck tinder, going to the local retirement home to see if I can pick up some fine wine broads 🔥
Make sure she has land
Tinder hides peoples accounts from being seen lowkey
Nah you just ugly
How much is a dream worth to you? I’ll pay the $20 to find someone I might be with for life

My treadmill is on fire what should I do?
Feed it a child
Ok should I grab the neighbors or find one in the metaverse.
Bet my whole portfolio on DKNG yesterday lol. Only down 30% no biggie
F
Might day trade whatever explodes tomorrow even tho I’ll get restricted if I day trade
I’m down to my last 1300 so I’m feeling poor and need to make it up
Worth. Just switch to another broker or call and ask for forgiveness
Imagine not jerking off for a whole month, couldn’t be me🤣
Imagine being a girl, where the whole challenge would be a nothingburger.
#nofap… save your super powers bro…
By adversely affecting your prostate and hormonal health while driving yourself insane? Pass.  My best ideas come after a good nut
Nut by all means, but nut with a female, not your hands
There is no health detriment to either. . . I’m married, we fuck 6/7 days a week generally, I still wank in the shower in the morning or after the gym.  Love my self pleasure too.  It’s not an either / or thing and idk where that idea came from.  Sure if you’re an incel porn addict, it’s probably time to quit jerking it and gain some social skills.  But for most folks I think it’s a non-issue
$SAVA I said it yesterday and it jumps 40% and today it just 50% tomorrow it's gonna hit double digits.
Sell off on friday
You can I won't. Look at the market cap Sava is worth 3.3bil and they have a cure for Alzheimer's.. Meanwhile mRNA is worth 113bil and peloton is an exercise bike company yet it's market cap is worth 27bil. Sava has alot more potential to go
PTON needs to buy OnlyFans. Sell the devices to thots and simps and facilitate the "interaction"

The law offices just contacted me on Zillow should I join the law suit?
> Yes.
Crazy thing is I don’t even own Zillow
Ask them what it’s about and go talk to your own attorney.
They did that to me when I listed my neighbor's home and let me tell you it is a bitch to move to Montana wilderness and change your identity. Wifi sucks here and I hate my new name.
My buddy had a call with GME today to talk about a lead programming position. He said it was the weirdest interview ever. They wouldn’t say shit because there are a bunch of apes calling in and faking to try and get info. I’ve got GME but JFC you dumb apes.
So he was just calling in to get info or no?
No he’s a lead programmer for a some defense contractor and makes 6 figures. I showed him the job opening and he decided to call and check it out. They said there are a bunch of fakers trying to apply to get info.
Fucking shameless. I love it.
Right? These dipshits are gumming up the recruiting process and hurting the company they’re obsessed about.
Which of these metaverse projects do you think looks the least retarded? I kinda wanted to make a little lobby with links to our shit and some live data in one of them so people don't snipe our name as usual and try to sell some shit.

It'll probably mostly live in the crypto sub (most of these things seem to be ways to sell virtual land to people) but that's still in its infancy.
I’m starting a project where I build the first ever metaverse within the metaverse.
All in on the metaverse in the long term account. Equal parts NVDA, FB, MSFT and AMZN (AWS).
> most of these things seem to be ways to sell virtual land to people

and i thought we couldn't get any more stupid
I think the concert idea is interesting. Live music when well recorded is always enjoyable and Fortnite has had success with concert like events. Someone is going to make tickets NFTs that people will hold for meta-clout and I'm going to hate it and think it's stupid but they'll make a ton of money.
MANA been around for awhile. SAND recently had a noticeable investment of around 100mil put in.
Have you heard of this thing called SecondLife?
reeeeee. I like the idea of a 3D Discord tho. Would be fun to build a little NYSE with all kinds of easter eggs and secret rooms and just have people chill and chat in it.
As long as I can build a script to spam dicks and dongs flying at people like chocolate rain, we all good fam
*I only want to see you laughing in the Chocolate Rain.*

*Chocolate Rain, Chocolate Rain*
I wish i could help with this, never worked in VR before. 😔
Second Life

Edit: joke already made, whatever
Some of you are really fucking stupid

No of course I'm not talking to *you*
You should be talking to me.
If VisualMod could comment in the thread without replying - I imagine this is what he'd say

Cathy about to tweet Elon and ask about a stock split. Do it queen
I would shit
If you guys are playing FDs on high IV positions during earnings... you guys might be stupid.

&#x200B;

^(Stupid too)
You’re in wrong sub dude
No seriously. Its stupid.

At least get them a few weeks out. Premiums drop drastically after earnings / earnings calls.
Z TO 60 TSLA TO 1300 that’d be cool
when is AAPL going to get off it's ass and do something - how can a company like PINS have literally zero change to their outlook or performance YoY while AAPL sells billions of devices, increases revenue 50% YoY (billions of dollars) and the stock sits still.     

AAPL, get back to innovation, don't let Zuck the fukboy bitch own you by circumventing your pay system and convincing people you're evil.   Create the apple metaverse and crush FB for all that is good on this planet.. and my portfolio
iFleshlight and it’s a wrap
Igirlfriend or Iboyfriend????
AAPL needs Steve Jobs to lead them into the AI era.
from the grave?
the stock sits still because their float is so huge, dipshit. try moving a limo vs a toy car
Apple is trash. Literally NOTHING without the iPhone.
Y'all best be buying that SOFI dip
No dip. Will be green at open
Idk what warrants even are but I think I'll just call it bullish and move forward
My 15c Jan 2023 leaps are printing hard. And I’m not selling … yet
Been bagholding shares since the last runup. Recently went green, now up 23%.

Not sure if I should sell some before earnings or just hope for the best...
Bought DWAC lottos anticipating a youngkin win in VA. I saw fuckloads of youngkin signs in typically blue areas of VA so it seemed reasonable. 

Youngkin wins VA. DWAC … doesn’t moon. 

Rekt.
what a terrible strategy, congrats
I know - Placing money anywhere near a 🥭 is typically a terrible strategy.
🥭 is a seasonal fruit  you know and it is definitely not in season right now 😝
I did the same. Should have just made a political bet on Predictit
I bought mangos too and “it feels great” - Tony the Tiger voice

Who was ever buying calls on Portnoy???
Portnoy
I think he paper handed those

Frozen pizza sucks
If you ask a girl if you have a big penis and she says yeah it’s huge and then rolls her eyes and giggles what does that mean
Your mom is making fun of you
She’s jealous
It means your mom is sick and tired of you asking her the same question every 5 minutes
Don’t be talkin about my mama
F
exactly what you think it means, it’s big
Nice 😎
Kinda obvious her bruv.  She rolled her eyes in orgasmic pleasure and giggled because it’s the first time someone made her feel like a real woman

Good call. What’s /s

Tesla calls 1340 11/26 😁 god I’m a retard. A brilliant retard.
A brilliant?huh
Imagine if the US government subsidized our capital losses with the same brackets they tax us at 💀. WSB alone would bankrupt the world
They do, but only $3,000/year
They got no problem taxing you more than 3K a year on gains tho
Now you got politicians wanting to tax unrealized gains.
God damn Hertz is something else. Went from basically bankrupt to YOLOing on Teslas and Tom Brady ads.
That's new Hertz though. All re-orged. The Portnoy Hertz went to zero or some shell on the OTC.
lol it's easy when you say you aren't going to pay your debts, then go right back out and get all new debts once the slate is clean
This is a new company
Does anyone else get pubic hair up the shaft of their pp?
Nah, but I have a few that spouted out the hole
Wtf
Yup
everyone knows you measure from where the hair stops...for some perspective, total length for me is about 7.5 inches but if i measure myself from where the hair stops (like one is supposed to) i'm about 2.5 inches (average).

Hope that helps!
do any of you cum after like 1 - 5 min, but then you get hard again 5 min later after you clean up, and you are good for like 1 hour ?
I thought that was normal…
me too. but my gf didn't think it was.  in that case....NOBODY TELL HER
The demon seed.  You’re supposed to rub that one out before (hand).
Hard not to cum after a few min, unless you got a desensitized weener probs

Edited: Gentlewoman. Aw i just noticed that. Thanks for giving her a great life 💙

Fuck you bers.
Good point. The great Retail fleece
Gonna get fucked on nvda calls
Ouch Uber!
#$PTON 🚀🚀
Yoloing 18k into calls on the first ticker that moves… hopefully NVDA or AMD
Be careful. I’ve played nvidia all year. I’d try and be patient to see a 270 range price before going balls deep again. Realistically Xilinx calls would be better than AMD.
Xilinx didn’t make me 10k today lmao
Bullish on OPEN. Would love to hear what my fellow apes think about it.

I need FB 340c to take me to tendie town

Loaded up on Penn 11/26 $65c for $1.73

Will I make money?
Maybe but maybe not. I’m leaning towards the latter.
Thanks man
Alright time to take my IC out back and shoot it.
Wow, today's earnings are breaking my portfolio. Only think keeping me afloat is SPY and that feels hella inflated
Wtf SQ
kinda predictable given trends lately (especially brother PYPL). I see it as a buying opportunity depending how low it goes as someone on the sidelines
'Upgraded' my PC to windows 11. The usual Microsoft fuckery, moved everything around so I can't do simple things like fire up my browser....oh and on that note, defaulted said browser to fuckin Edgelord again, pisspot.

who got pton puts, jesus thats a massive bagger
Yeaaaaa let’s gooooo
Fuck, should’ve invested WSB again. PINS puts are gonna fuck me over.
Gpro huge earnings
DDOG!!!!!!! Lets gooooo
I swear UBER shareholders are just a bunch of bag holding hedge funds who bought on IPO and never got a chance to leave with profit. They seem to be able to hold forever and CNBC seems to try to pump their bags whenever they can
Was ready to pull the trigger on a PTON 75p at close, but chickened out.  Fak.
I saw everyone here saying puts were the call so I stayed away turns out puts were the call🤣
woulda been lottery….

i lost money today
PTON capitulation. Shambles. There moves are vicious
PINS coming back to earth.
DDOG 🚀🚀🚀
My net position is hedged but I'm super interested to see what happens. Lol
I'm holding shares since 30 but decided to buy some puts this go around
I've got about 1k in shares average cost of 60ish. I hedged instead of dumping because the tax bill would be worse than the cost of hedging
NOVAVAX
All my earnings plays aren’t doing shit. Except RKT and I bought puts 😭
What was EPS for RKT?
Idk dawg I’m waiting till after the earnings call
Rest In Peace PTON
Good earnings for SQ. Just like ETSY people sell in AH and lose out big.
I can't find the numbers
Dude wtf did PortNO do?
I’m glad I didn’t buy that pton call but not happy about the sq and Uber calls I got.
Sometimes positions are so obvious they almost seem so surreal as to be untrue. Peloton short at 90$ in the midst of supply chain problems, commodity pressure & conclusion of reopening (like SNAP) was one of them. Hope whoever bet the house on this thread earlier in the week made out like a bandit.
BBBY, QC, and NVDA

Holy fuck.

Bro i watched those this morning. %800+ gains in a day unreal
2800p
The dust hasn’t settled yet …..
NET cant die
Wait
Yeah AH. Same shit last er. Then the day after it ended green.
I’ve seen enough, as long as NET is above $200, this market is irrational
It's priced to fence off takeover

The market is more than just numbers
Why is pins up tho lol
No earnings yet
Already reported, you're late
They released like 20 min ago. Beat on EPS and revs.
Look how good ATVI was looking in after hours before the dump
Net reverse??
How low would PTON have to go for you to buy.
They have no moat. Nothing special. Had some bad recall earlier the year. Not sure what the attraction is to them
I don’t see the USP, there are a number of companies banging out the same stuff, don’t have the marketing that PTON have though
They couldn’t pay me to hold that trash
Wouldn’t buy it at any price. Idc how their profitability is/was, the product is laughable
People love it, some colleagues of mine have one and bang on about it constantly.
And this right here is why i don’t ever play earnings lol
So NET does go down
Damn now I think my PTON 90/80 put spreads were conservative.
PENN April 2022 $80 calls
Got 0 stake in PTON but on the watchlish just to watch it burn. Commercials annoying as shit.
Lmao PTON Is that dip real?
Anyone else rip addy in sales?

Hitting your qouta is cake
Sold my NET because it's already up 60%+ since September. Thought we'd see a pullback after earnings...
Cassava sciences has started phase three trials for its game changing drug simufilam for treating Alzheimer’s. It has recently been the focus of an investigation as a lawyer representing an anonymous “whistleblower” who claimed manipulation of the data specifically concerning western blot results. The anonymous client did divulge that he/she was heavily shorting the stock. Today peers from the Journal of Neuroscience finished their review of the data and found no evidence of manipulation. Across the board Doctors agree that the drug will be approved after trials finish and it will be the only drug in their arsenal that may halt or possibly even reverse some of one of the most frustrating disease processes of our time. Larry Ramer a contributor of Investor’s Place calculates that the stock should easily 200x after the FDA approves the drug as a years worth will cost anywhere from $55,000-$250,000 a year per patient. The stock has been rated as a strong buy across the board with a $200 price target already in place. 

Now I’m not good with 🍆💦 emojis or retard ape prose. All I know is this stock is gonna fly higher than Willie Nelson on the roof of the White House. This is not financial advice. Do your own DD fuckwads
Got it. SAVA puts
Too many words.
True I needed double spacing

All sq is announce they sold their beechboy and bought nvda pre200. It’s go to 300 just like nvda dis today

Fuck yeah
Theta gang always wins anything I play. ABNB. So lame
What calls did you have?
Will NET ER plays go to theta gang?
Yeah, my puts were up like 20% before close on IV alone. They gonna get crushed lol
HYLN going above $9 tomorrow
Are $PINS numbers good ?
Yeah, looks like they beat.
Financials are good but they fell short on user numbers and will do worse next year.
I’m down bad on my Pton sharws. Halppp
I bought one PUT of PTON for $81 lol wonder how much I’ll make on that under or over 1k?
Probably about 1k
Depends on date and opening price. I will say don’t get spooked at open the price is gonna be going all over the place. Wait and see if it’s gonna keep sliding before you sell. Only if it’s the kind of buying like for Etsy today should you panic sell it. Most likely there will be more value to be had.
Only a miracle market dump will save my Spy 460 Puts expiring tomorrow... DEAD... Should have stayed out of the markets with my bear ass... FML
My TSLA 1240c is -40%. Sell tomorrow at open or leave it?

if it spikes overnight then definitely sell. if it doesn’t, observe the market for an hour or so and make a decision. tsla has been crazy lately so you have a good chance to get at least some of the money back

TSM finna run until EOY at least. You heard it here 10284725th
Can't wait for the Cramer pump of net tonight. It's bound to happen gotta jump on after that 100% run up.

SPY 12/17 466C I purchased yesterday for 5.70 a pop are up 50%. Decay is slow now that they're ITM. Should be a nice 2 bagger closer to expiration. Shoulda bought more than 3.
OI on 500c 1/21 is pretty intense, I figure someone knows something and bought one.  If it hits I'll be wishing I bought more than one
Yep. Wouldn't be surprised if we see 480 by 12/17. Probably won't wait til then to sell but I'm comfortable with them ITM right now. Might be more than a 2 bagger.
Holding my BIRD shares hoping they buy me more BIRDs
More F, F, F. We’ve entered growth stock multiple rerating + earnings power on debt repayment + Rivian. Next stop $500B!
So NET earnings good or bad? Market seems undecided
How high does everyone think nvda goes before earnings? It seems to be almost like tesla with its unstoppable momentum.
> I think it will go to $200 before earnings.
Ban bet that or you have no balls.
If I was an institutional investor I would either be selling deep itm calls or buying puts tmrw morning g to destroy NVDA
AMC just announced its entering the popcorn industry, what are you guys planning so I can inverse it
When I first came here everyone was all about MSFT, it was talked about more then SPY and any other meme stock, flash forward a year and everyone seems to be spinning their wheels on everything else while MSFT 🚀
I don't know why I always miss out on NVDA super moon days like this one. I sold NVDA calls a few days before the FB ER where Zuck said something about the metaverse, and that NVDA would benefit from it. NVDA gained 6% that day. And now this 14% day. Sold NVDA calls yesterday.

Although both times, I profited at least 100% each.
Cloudflare is the 🐐. Bought into that at $87 and just a few months later… I just wish I’d been able to afford some calls on it
Sold mine at 23$ over a year ago.... Can't relate lmao
Well I’m also the idiot that bought 70 shares of square my senior year of college at $12/share, held them for 6 years, and panic sold for $40 in March 2020 during the crash. You win some you lose some

PTON in absolute shambles holy shit
Holy shit I’m glad I listened to the lady on tv who said to dump PTON today. I did right after she said it. Thanks lady!!! Saved me 3k.
Pton feels like ocugen yesterday.
Here we go boyz! Now run, then rewalk :) "FDA Awards Breakthrough Device Designation to the ReWalk ReBoot Soft Exo-Suit"

Fk, should not have sold my NET shares.
NET is the honey badger of cloud. Gonna steal AWSs lunch
Is it just me or were earnings misses this time around especially brutal? I don’t remember companies plunging so much on their last round of misses.
earnings multiples too high
Well you got way overvalued companies that benefited from COVID, and now cannot benefit from COVID anymore lol. Like PTON was generating profit last year and now they are losing money like crazy + the business itself is questionable at best
I know this might be the most bullish moment since sometime in 1999, but doesn't QQQ at a near-record 84.5 RSI and with that huge green dildo flying out of the price channel make anyone even a bit nervous?
New paradigm — actually. Opinions on the structure / spending aside, if/when the BBB agenda passes we are looking at a pretty intense economic push, one that will be led as always by tech and fledgling energy-tech.  

I’m no C. Woods, but this bull run might just be getting started.

nice. I shorted NET instead. You short a business because it's taking a bad turn, not because you think it went up too much. I hope I learned my lesson
even though it's AH I thought PTON was done drilling but it's still going holy shit
Yeah my shares I bought r fuk

either way its so beat down its just gotta go up right
Man, could you believe that Penn was $140 in February??
Oh God, I'm fucked aren't I?
I hold some DKNG too so I hope not.
I've got some 2024 leaps so Ive got time, but a change in direction would be nice
Haha 😆
Glad I sold all but one of my sq calls, same shit different stock everything tanks on earnings 🤡🤡

Z gotta tank for me tomorrow and SPY needs to go up a bit more, thats not too much to ask for right

Sold my 11/19 $70 puts on Pton call before close thinking a smug 150% gain wasn’t bad. Then earning tanked it ITM ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
I always very close to buying a call at 3:59 pm. Glad I didn’t
Hindsight sucks man. 150% gain any day is pretty good though
Gains are gains. I thought today was Friday and decay has hammered me before.
Think pton puts will still make money if you buy em in the morning?!
You could have gotten 86p for 5.25 and 4x tomorrow

RIP any direction biased UBER options
They butchered my darling
Peloton right now
Remember when Airbnb sold off massively because pussies got worried about insider selling. Pepperidge farm remembers.
So zillow is going out of business
Idk about that but they royally fucked up. What they did was the most autistic thing I’ve seen since archegos. CEO should be a mod here
Npr said there firing employees and closing its doors
Well shit. Puts then I guess
Closing its doors lol- layoffs yes, but not closing its doora
You can lead a person to knowledge but you can't make them think.

Zillow is stopping its home buying/flipping program and laying off 25% of its workforce.

The whole company isn't going out of business....

You bought 11/5’s didn’t you.
I think there’s so much money people want to invest now to hedge against bad times, that people are buying overpriced stocks at a “value” just because they are a “value” compared to the other overpriced stocks.
what kind of retards are buying a Chevy Volt instead of a Tesla Model 3?
Why buy a Tesla over virtually anything German or Japanese is the real question
Wtf Tesla’s are sweet and don’t need to pay for gas
bmw and Toyota make nicer Electric cars
Nicer in what way? And nah Tesla’s are sleek and sexy af they are 100% the leaders in EV
lol no they do not.
Kim Jong Adolf over here
cuz BuY aMeRiCaN and also theyre fuckin awesome
Probably US govt gonna announce an EV contract to outfit all their shit.  Not gonna be TSLA unfortunately
Retards that want to save $20k.  The actual price of a Bolt (Volt was discontinued 2019) after rebates and incentives was quite less than MSRP.  I paid a little over $30k for my loaded 2020 Bolt.  I despise chevy but after a test drive I immediately bought the Bolt.  A model 3 is better but not $20k better.
Same dude who called pton puts also said pins puts. Prob still come out Ahead but welp

U buy calls too?
$8k worth
Man I’m in for 2k and sweating bullets.

When did u buy? I bought at open lol then it tanked
I think it may just be collateral damage from the Penn and Portnoy incident. DKNG for sure on my radar to scoop up possible FD's for recovery early next week.
Watch as the NY conference for the future of digital marketplaces ends and wait for the GME dividend.

You sure about that? That weekend outage cost them a shitload of money. Kinda risky tbh

Instantaneously, when you press the buy button, you become a loser

As soon as your options expire
Not by the hair of my PENNy PENN PENN
has amd peaked or is this going full retard again tomorrow
I sold my calls 114 11/5 yesterday all except one of them to exercise. I missed 40% gains today, it actually hurts worse than straight up losing. 

It feels too dangerous for me to fomo back in after my great run.
Welp PTON burned my January $115 calls! Can’t imagine bagholding the stock after that guidance. Just thankful my loss will one day expire while others will have to wait for the next pandemic to break even. Learned my lesson on Covid stocks today.
If you think the party's been good so far boyz ....

Just wait for next week's PLTR moon shot - everything coming together perfectly.

Ya got 90 minutes from open tomorrow 11//5 to get those CALLs CALLs CALLs..
I see, I see…$23.60 in your future.
I sold $30 covered call options. I hope it moons.
An excellent move.  You will be happy man.
Why would it moon tomorrow? Earnings are on the 9th
not mooning tomorrow 11/5 -   but will  be next week.   tomorrow 11/5 time to buy calls.
RDFN and UBER better tank tomorrow.
Some guy from Lyft on Bloomberg earlier was talking about working fir Lyft being like an ATM in your pocket. It’s $30 an hour whenever. Best deal ever. 

Fucker left out the cost of operating a vehicle. Labor costs will eat them alive (car parts, inflation, etc).
At least those expenses are tax deductible
So what if you’re losing money.
Dont forget DVT.
A lot of drivers are renting these cars
These rentals aren’t free. 

When someone says $30 a hour and brags about it being the best deal, it’s implied it’s an hourly wage. Even without getting into W2 vs. 1099. It’s just not $30 even if it was the amount earned. The car is a big cost here.
The point is they're not paying for tires, maintenance, etc which is more costly

How do I calculate what my DDOG 167.5 11/5 C gonna be worth tomorrow?
you have to check the updog quotes. should give you a good indication.
Whats updog quotes? Is it similar to ligma calculator?
very very similiar.
> The first thing you need to do is go to the DDOG 167.5 11/5 C page and then click on the "calculate" button. This will open up a new window which gives you all of your options for how much money can be made from this investment opportunity, including what percentage chance it has of paying out in full (100%), partial payouts (50%, 25% or 10%) as well as whether or not there's any risk at all that it won't make back its initial $1k USD value even if everything goes perfectly according to plan with no hiccups along the way!
Wait til market open lol
I have the patience of a 3 year old and the same mental capacity too actually
ToS has a nice analysis feature.
The amount of time I spend looking at stocks is inversely correlated with the stuff I have to do at work ... and honestly I've made more in a week of stocks than I do in 2 months of work.
I feel bad, I haven’t done shit all week
I’m buying more ABNB in the morning. Excellent quarter and they’re now profitable, love it
It really won’t last. Even shitty places are more expensive than hotels a lot of the time. They had a good run because people were desperate to get away and were fine paying the inflated service fees. Doubtful it lasts even though I enjoy using the platform.
I disagree. I travel constantly (in Europe right now in an Airbnb in fact) and having a kitchen alone is a game changer vs a hotel. Add in that most hotels aren’t very well run (bad breakfast that’s often overpriced, no outdoor space, saw the staff almost get in a fist fight at a Hilton in London last time I stayed in one) and I think it’s an easy choice. I’ve been spending about six months a year in Airbnbs a month at a time. Beats long term rentals in so many ways and it’s not that much more in many markets.
My closed minded Brooklyn ass just thought about America lol. 

I used airbnb extensively in and around Europe and had a fantastic experience. Never had to pay for accommodation in London since I have a lot of family there but assume it’d also be a good experience.

What do you do that a time difference doesn’t impact anything for 6 months work wise? I’m remote but would need to clear with managers bouncing to Europe for anything longer than 3 weeks.
Programming and trading my personal portfolio but mostly trading at this point. Easy enough to program on a different time zone and I’m awake for premarket always haha
That’s a fair point. Self employed? I was a SWE til I moved to product.
I had some self employed clients for a bit but I’m technically salaried. Company got acquired and I’m basically one of the only people who knows how to run things. I just do a little maintenance and chill as the new company is a bit of a mess
Amazing situation - congrats
I don't know if you want to lick my balls, or
Sure why not bro. Pull them out
Only if you just worked out
On a scale of fucked to absolutely mob fucked, how fucked are my sq calls tomorrow?
well sometimes stocks go down on great earnings, maybe this will be the inverse and go up on bad earnings?
This is the absolutely incorrect reassurance I need right now. Thanks.
Expiring tomorrow? What strike? 😂 the mob is already launching trebuchets of red dildos at you
> The strike is at $7,000.
🪦
Nah, next Friday. 260c’s. I’ll probably just hold into next week at this point because I’m sure they’ll open worthless tomorrow.
They’ll be 90% down, might as well hold them and see if some magic news comes out. Seriously, I’ve gotten fucked by Mon/Tues news so many times and it’s already near worthless
Yeah, exactly how I feel. Might as well hold into next week hoping for a rebound at this point. Ironically enough, I bought these calls with profits from other SQ calls so even if they die worthless, it’s essentially just a break even.
wish PINS to the ground
yeah unfortunately that didn't happen
weak AH so might still have a slim chance tomorrow after open
My account hit an ATH today and Im still pissed because of how badly OCGN fucked me this week…it was too boku.

!banbet $ZM 200 3w
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/SINYACHTA** bet **ZM** goes from **278.2** to **200.0** before **2021-11-25 20:34:04.025578-04:00**
It's funny I've been buying calls basically all 2021 but lately for this earnings season I've added more puts into positions.

I guess sentiment has gone negative for quite a few of the mid cap growth names
this season is nuts with the way the market punishes for not just misses, but even weak guidance
I was just mentioning this. Misses and lowered guidance has always brought down stocks. But while fuck it’s like exponentially more punishing this time around
atvi fell 15% after it crushed earnigns and raised its guidance, except that guidance was slightly below what the analysts were saying. CHEGG falling 50% on a miss? crazy shit.
Market probably felt a lot of these had way too good of a run due to covid so it's adjusting risk level a bit.

I think ATVI got over punished but that entire sector has been dismal anyways (except TTWO which has recovered a decent amount).
Electronic Arts is priced double in terms of sales and book value
i mean when you look at the chart you can see it is atvi's pattern to go way up then way down, which feeds into my weird theory that the company follows the charts, not the other way around
Is it because people think it’s likely everything is overvalued right now? Miss by a little. Oh shit here comes the crash.
possibly. i think the market is also super sentimental right now, ton of ppl just jumping on whatever the trend is. look at tsla and nvda.
Hell look at this place lol. Maybe traders were never much smarter than us retards all along.

Inflation a bitch - now subway can’t do the five dollar footlong, now that shit is 8.99
only thing good about subway is cookies. rest is dog food get some tastebuds
For like the past 7 years
I think it's kinda bs that Subway never had a class action lawsuit about their footlongs being only 11", but somehow RedBull had to give every RedBull drinker a free 4-pack of the 8oz cans because they lied about it "giving you wings" in their commercial portrayals
> I agree, it's totally bs. I'm glad that they settled and we can finally get on with our lives
Shit does this mean my tinder dates can sue me when I say I have a 7 inch weapon?
Not if you own a Survival knife.
I mean it was literally 1 sandwich from 1 store. And because they didn’t let the bread rise enough. It’s still the same bread regardless.
So the person who circulated the 11" pic is the liar? I hope Subway sued them for libel
> Yes. The person who circulated the 11" pic is a liar
I mean it’s not lying. But it’s like 1 Frontier being defective and trying to make the argument that all of them are, ya know?
Of course. That's outrageous. A Frontier would never be defective.
It’s in the top 20 pickup trucks for sure
> You're a fucking idiot and I'm not going to argue with you.
You remind me of my parents - verbally abusive
> I'm sorry.

What’s the deal with PENN tanking?
Woke Culture
Give me a little more detail than that please. Financials the exact same as before?
All gambling stocks took a hit today because of PENN reporting lower quarterly earnings. As someone who uses multiple gambling platforms, barstool is on the lower end. Not surprising they took a step back
Thank you for your response. I appreciate it!
No their earnings were literally flaming shit
Missed profit by 40% and check Dave’s insta
Seeing you wrote 40 made me go double check. That’s some pretty bad stuff.

what happens when they get bombed by NK?
NK will lose it all if they ever do that. As chess players say, the threat is better than the execution.

So taping is out of the way now and the only thing that maybe can kill our beloved Stock Market is Evergrande scandal but I haven't heard from it for like a few weeks now. I guess we'll keep see ATH until Summer next year or until something unexpected bad gonna happened somewhere in the future.
CNBC will find a new reason for the "inevitable" market crash next week, don't worry
We will have a shock event out of the Fed’s control in Q1 or Q2 imo. I will take profits if we see SPY500.

I thought they got that ship out months ago
That's Evergreen. I'm talking about Evergrande from China with a debt of $300B.

My FSLY FD was up 100% when market opened, hold it till -50% because I'm retarded, lol.
Next time, sell half at 100% and let the rest ride. Worst case, you break even. Well, worst case is that it goes another 1000000% and you could've doubled your profits.

You ever hurt yourself by blinking too hard
I’m not programmed to blink
Hey Zuck. Always though you hung around these here parts.
You should moisten your eyeballs with sweet baby rays occasionally or all of that meat smoke will dry them out
Yes, but fake eyelashes are a bitch
No, hard blinks always feel good and refreshing.
Does anybody use ibkr pro? How much does it cost per month? I can’t find that anywhere on their site
If you gotta ask you aren’t their target audience
Account is free. You pay for data subscriptions and you can also opt in to pay fees for trades and you get optimal pricing. They scan multiple exchanges to fill. I pay for the 125 a month data feed and it gives me live data for everything I trade.
Has anyone noticed that a few drops of Sweet Baby Rays will help keep your eyes moist if they’re feeling dry from all of that meat smoke?
They also keep books upright.

I'd squid games just to hit the casino a bit. Suffering is why I come here in the first place.
The game is rock paper scissors. You choose which one goes up your ass first, but you have to do all three.
rock scissor paper in that order. rock would be painful but widen my anus enough that the scissor could slip right in and the paper would be less likely to cut the sides of my butthole.

If you love the stock, then buying whenever is never stupid. Hold nvda and make your fds on other stocks
So puts?
Not for me
Congrats to all the Put holders for MRNA, ROKU, PYPL. Fuck you to all the NVDA, QCOM, AMD even AMZN call holders, all of you mofo's made out like looters during a plague lol. AND a big fuckkk Yoouuu to the PTON put holders, that play in hindsight was right under the nose and a lot of us missed it with all the other BS.
PTON was almost too obvious, hence why most avoided it I think
Yea I was looking at $pton and completely forgot about it looking at other plays 🤦‍♂️
There was some DD on here a few days ago and I forget the guys username but he said 90$ puts on pton and outlined his case extremely well

I don’t blame them lmao it’s hard enough to sleep in that city as it is
They should ban the noise of airplanes/trains/car horns first. That’s more of a constant noise
The elevated trains. Fuk
They should. Too much noise
Gonna miss that classic NYC sound
Nothing wrong with that. Hope they ban cars with speakers on the outside as well. I don't care about your shitty music. Keep it to yourself

Its absoloute horseshit that if you can daytrade as much as you want, long as you're rich.

Your rage is on display, and I live for it.
I’m gonna punch a fucking whole in my wall

I got the account size for it but I avoid trading heavily unless I’ve been paying close attention for 2 weeks straight.
25k isn’t rich boss
If I'm playing poker with million dollar pots, I don't want some guy with bad breath and body odor trying to buy in with his $20 and then complaining about table stakes.
So Elon tweeted that there was not actually a deal with Hertz.

Probably so tens of thousands of actual retail customers who have been waiting 12-18 months for their Tesla Model S-3-X-Y aren’t pissed about some dumb **bankrupt company** coming in and delaying their orders.

I couldn’t let lose gains slap me in the face. Good luck to all bulls involved - I’ll be watching with my ten shares. Meteoric day
I bought 12/17 275C's yesterday and closed today for +125% or so.  Walked away with like 6750 which couldve been like 15k. I closed at +8% because what fucking non meme penny stock runs 16% on the day? Oh well profit is profit.  I bought  12/17 300p to hopefully catch some on the ride down.
Good luck! I can’t bring myself to buy puts on them - watch out for their presentation on Tuesday - stock always runs through those

What did they say?
They lowered guidance and said that the days of high revenue and low expenses during covid are gone. Initial revenue from bike sales not translating to continued revenues from subscriptions etc
Well Becky needs a bike so I hope we least go back to 70🤣😭

Tesla is tesla... I have no fucking idea about tesla.
AMD pumping till the end of time
Don't worry about missed wins, there's a new one every week at least.

Also you can't follow it once its already up 40%.

Just buy random shit for some kinda reason, eventually one of them will be a win.

Just make sure the reason makes sense and isn't FOMO bs
I don’t know how young, young is these days… here’s what I’d say… total noob, smooth brained ape shit… but a couple kids and some worldly experience… and wished I had pounced on some shit when I was young….

Invest in what you want. Even if it’s small bits of those huge things. Or look at what the next thing might be. There’s nothing wrong with spreading out a bunch of $100 bets on good companies to get started. Keep investing in those over a few months. Then you can use some of that to make a bigger move on the next huge thing, or one of these crazy YOLO bets people do. 
If I had started throwing $10, $20, $100 bucks into my fave stocks here and there in my 20s I’d be fucking  filthy rich now. But like I said, I’m just a idiot.
Early 20s with a bachelors
Shit ya, go for it. Get yourself a mixed portfolio of some of your favorites. Like I said don’t have to do anything major just get started. Then you can make a play in a year or whatever if that’s your goal. Baby steps. Nothing wrong with baby steps. Just set your goals and stay with it. Don’t wait another 10 years like I did.

NVDA treated me really well today. Where do we think TSLA is going tomorrow? Holding a significant amount in 0dte calls

TSLA ⬇️
This dude is really enjoying what he’s doing to me right now, dedication like that is rare these days
Slob on your knob like corn on the cob
UBER just posted it's first profit ever and almost $5 billion in quarterly revenue (up from $3 billion YoY) and the stock is dumping because they lost money on a garbage Chinese investment they divested after concluding the business was shit and that nobody cares about anyway. Lol.
HAve a feeling it was immediate reaction but tomorrow its going to rally thru EOD

Going to load up with calls
I like I like.

"Hertz put out another release, wherein it said it is partnering with Uber Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:UBER) to make up to 50,000 Teslas available by 2023 for drivers to rent when using the Uber network"

Market knows it’ll be green tomorrow. That’s why it went green for a bit and came back after a 5% drop AH
The stock is not even down 2% for the day

>Stock Dumping 

>Ok
Way to call me out
Emotional investing is only acceptable when you’re profiting
How tf is Chipotle almost a 2K stock?!
Stock price doesn’t equal market cap, for example Ford is a lower price but has a higher market cap, just has to do with splits and dilution.
GameStop killed this subreddit
$15 dollar Burrito fast food dude that place sucks
Sucks to be you, they're only like $8 everywhere else
I wouldn’t go there if you bought me one!
Good, stay away, lunch lines are long enough as it is
Stock prices do not matter, only market cap does.
I could never buy Chipotle. Imagine reading burrito news. Kill yourself.
i would like a real answer shit doesn’t make sense to me
The honest answer is because the market values it as a $50b dollar enterprise.
Their food isn’t even that good
They scammed me out of $40 the other day, so I guess that's how they're making money these days.
Tech is undervalued IMO
After NVDA and NET bounced off the moon?

Mid day even better, 46C up 40%
It has been 100 hours since the last time I emptied my balls through ejaculation. The nights are getting longer and the days shorter.

We just ignoring metaverse copying VRchat?
clearly the next logical acquisition for FB is Pornhub

as if playstation didn't try this avatar shit and call it "home" years ago.

only difference is VR
Exactly, why did they go all in on this bs, changing name and everything
Yeah, cause MetaVerse actually has the billions of dollars to make something scary good.

You guys think Rivian IPO will rub off on SOFI share price? Since they’re the only one offering it and Rivian for sure gonna moon
> Rivian is a small company that will probably go public in the next year. SOFI is a large company with an established business model and multiple growth drivers. Rivian’s stock price will likely not have any impact on SOFI’s share price

Just got paid. WHY THA FUCK AM I BEING TAXED 33% and I’m living in fucking North Carolina? 😡🤬
Try living in Cali where gas is at $5 and everything here cost an arm and a leg
and taxes exceed 50% of income.
Nobody said you have to live there
Just putting into perspective that 33% tax may not be bad
Damn you can only buy 4 things before you have to turn to murder.  I guess maybe only two things.
HAHAHA, he thinks 33% is being heavily taxed. That's quaint.
When you barely make less than 80k a year, 33% that’s absurd
To pay for pre and after school programs. Houses for the homeless, food, healthcare, etc. 

It’s all your fault and you must pay.
Man fuck them kids!
401k, HSA. Reduce that taxable income.
are we bullish on Metaverse (Dec 1)?
I mean every metaverse stock is mooning.

Fair enough, it's the future of the internet tbh
It’s too regarded not to be bullish on. The Autism is strong in the metaverse
Are you bullish on VR second take?
This VR never works. The technology like the Matrix is not available so not a chance.
That’s what they said about going to the moon.
That’s what they said about VZ since the 90s. It never took off. 

That’s what they said about:

if BABA was an american company it would be worth $1T+ easily. lmfao.
It would be wish if that were tru
With the earnings they have it would be at 3-4 trillion if priced like Amazon. They actually warrant a higher p/e than Amazon due to better margins, growth rates, guidance, performance in the market, honestly just everything
Of BABA was American. Amazon and Walmart would have killed it in its infancy
We have and American baba it’s called Amazon

Chill. You see only few cashing out, rest are holding heavy bags
Was laying in bed with a hot chick that wanted to fuck randomly and I pushed her off like a moron. Trying to play the indifferent Chad thing (dumb move). She was spooning and got my undies wet from her pussy..

I went to work and had the worst case of blue balls I've ever had. Where I couldn't even bend over. Had to jerk off in a bathroom stall.
did her boobs feel like sand?

American dad might be better than family guy
It is family guy is nostalgic tho
I think Family Guy's decline is overstated, but American Dad is just that enjoyable. It's been better for over 10 years.
Facts.  It took 6 seasons to get good, but once it found it footing, it took over.  Family Guy got really boring around season 9-10, but I haven’t watched it since.
You mean the show that was inspired and created by the creators of Family Guy. Yeah, sure.
Tesla will retest 1000 in the next 10 trading days

Dune was so overhyped
It played like a trilogy not a stand alone movie. I think that’s what ppls frustration with it was.  But I think looking back it will be it’s strength
I liked it but I also read the books as a kid so I know the whole story. There are two more parts. Nothing beats the books ever but it’s the best of the current three versions for film.
There's a reasonable chance you could understand this movie, without any back story. I was pissed it ended where it did, but then realized I was almost 3 hours in .  


Agreed best of any of the films.
I loved Dune the book. Are any others in the series of similar quality?
If you like the greats like lord of the rings and Harry Potter, stuff that are considered true classics I would recommend the kingkiller chronicles. First book is called “The name of the wind” the second “The wise mans fear” the third is still being waited on.
The expanse or hyperion maybe.
As far as dune goes there are a lot of books but I like the core ones mainly. The movies will cover dune and dune messiah
Dune and Messiah are great. Children gets fucking weird, but it’s a must if you want to finish off Heretics and GEoD. Which are legit.
books are incredible though, fanbois probably have something to do with all the hype
I read the book and thought it was okay but I definitely see it being a let down to people. I like reading their thoughts in the book and I felt like missing that was a let down. Still okay tho
Pretty visuals. Boring ass movie
I mean if there was at least 2 more hours of dream sequences and arrakis flyovers, I think he really would have captured the core ideas of the novel..

whats the news on him? I've been under a rock
Can we get a dip buyers union or something. Heroes all of you.
My move tomorrow will be a fetal position crying in my bedroom floor.

Not really. But a week ago I bought 15 PTON puts with an $81 strike expiring 11/12 for $1.56 each. I forgot I had a limit order set on it, and it filled just before close. I made a profit of $4,200.

How much will those puts be worth tomorrow morning once the market opens? I’m guessing i missed out on at least $20K in additional profit.
Bro 4200 is 2+ months rent be grateful
Don’t get me wrong, ecstatic with the gains themselves. Grateful to the guy who yolo’ed $20K into Peloton puts last week on WSB as well, he/she did some great research and the play seemed like a no brained. Just wish I hadn’t set a limit order until after earnings, or at the very least not on all of the contracts. Oopsie
Those 15 would probably be worth close to 26k if it opens at the price its at now
> I'm not sure what you're trying to say, but the price of ETH is currently $1,152.10
You made great money.

i have found the infinite money glitch!

short 100 shares of GME seconds before close. then put an order to close it a dollar off the close in AH = free 100 dollars

its worked 3 days in a row! its my most consistent profitable strategy
You keep grinding out that rent money, Joe. It’s noble of you.
I, for one, hope that Tesla does yet another ATH after hours or pre market.
#PTON AT 69 AFTER HOURS. NICE 👅
Well no kidding PTON is dumping.  The casual PTON users aren't going to re-sub or buy new machines.  They're going outside.
I got pins puts and Uber calls lmao 🤣

Pins go dowwwnnnn!!!

Imagine being Jack Dorsey and trying to be a guhthtie woods level charlatan and screech about hyperinflation so people will buy worthless internet coins as “a hEdGe” so he can make money. Sorry Jack my boy, but Baron Muskrat founded PayPal, and I’m not one to go against the cult.
You have to be a scumbag to make it to tres comas, period. And many of them seem to have some God complex, which is not surprising, given they are treated that way.
Yeah idk what world is Jack Dorsey qualified to make a claim about hyperinflation. Bought SQ at 60 but glad I sold that overvalued PoS at 260 when he started shilling buttcoin.
In Hebrew Meta means death fyi
Did someone destroy the sell button for NET? It can‘t stop going up
In SQ call waiting to start. They have an odd choice of music
Any chance they turn it around and their stock goes up
No
If USA wants to be the number one economy again they just need to do what China does it’s that simple. Chinas future is running the show in Asia, Europe, and Africa and they pretty much already achieved complete suzerainty so obviously the US needs to just belt and road initiative their way to South America lmfao. What the fuck is Mexico and South America doing anyways? They all want to come here so why not just expand our way down to them. Their government is far more incompetent than our own we would be doing them a favor lmfao. Just an idea.
Actually great idea and I’m a vocal advocate of colonization, it was a mistake to ever end the practice. Weaker / slower cultures should be consumed and/or absorbed along with their resources.  

Life is not Little League where we let the retarded kid try to pitch and everyone gets a participation trophy.
Harsh but Darwinism be doing what it do no matter what
The US used to do that after ww2 with countries like germany and japan which is why they became a global super power, its cant compete with china now, too much greed in the military complex and politics,
Things can always change. I believe in the American spirit I just haven’t seen that spirit for a long time. It just takes Americans deciding that they want to be better, instead of a bunch of whiney bitches. Our country is such a clown show there’s not a single person in politics that I respect anymore.
Biggest problem with US now isnt international policy it domestic, College enrollment has plummeted during covid (cos college is a scam for anyone not doing stem or going ivy) so theirs a national security threat with Chinas enrollment hitting 54.4%. Lack of affordable housing and education and means that the stereotypical dumb fat north american will become a reality
Whelp, time to start whipping these fat fucks into shape. It’s all up to the people to decide what they want to be. If people choose to be weak then there will be hard times coming that create stronger people than them. I 100% blame unregulated capitalism for this though, Wall Street wanted dumb fat consumers and that’s what they got. Now they will realize the consequence of parasatizing the middle class into oblivion while China grows theirs. The clowns running the show are just as dumb as the consumers they look down on. Meanwhile chinese youth are highly motivated to be strong and smart citizens who have worth and skills.
Word
Does this infrastructure bill include the 40B dollar sea gates that New York is going to need to stay afloat in the next century?
Let it be cleansed. It’s in the Bible dumbass.
Prob not
$CLF is going to moon with the infrastructure package.
So leaps for mid next year?
This stock is going to explode.
NKLA gained 2 billion in market cap today. We are in a fucking MEME MARKET
Gravity drive >>> electric vehicles
Calls on infrastructure to rebuild all roads downhill
On news that they are paying $125M to settle with SEC too. I guess that is chump change with how much value they gained for that.
If PTON could pull an ETSY and moon tomorrow that would be great.
Wish I didnt buy amzn puts yesterday! O well TSLA 1270 tomorrow
$CLOV... last day before report Q3 earnings on Monday... ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses)
Seriously why do you think clov is gonna make you money? How can you look at the market and think “yup, I’m gonna invest in this healthcare middleman.”
I already made money with $CLOV and will keep making money and will make a LOT of money in the future... Why? Because $CLOV is the future of the healthcare! Good luck!
QQQ daily RSI crossed 70 (overbought) and is currently 78

First time since July

Last time daily RSI was this high was September of last year when it hit 80. QQQ dropped $30 from there fast

Everytime it has reached this RSI level it has dipped considerably quickly

You can downvote but it’s literally facts
Spy is sitting just below at 75
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Pull backs are healthy anyway. Makes people examine their holdings and dump the dogshit.
We just had a September pullback. Im long and picked up a bunch of big tech leaps and shares end of sept. Lets see ur shorts if ur so convinced
Short zoom or nah?
Like actually short shares, or just long puts (like a pussy)?
Puts… so like pussy
Yeah, way safer.  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)

Lol
Bag holding these DKNG calls I bought at open, hoping they crush or I’m fucked.
Where is your wife, for I desire to be her boyfriend?
This might sound real dumb… but PTON is at the lowest point since like July of last year. Huge dump now with some kind of recovery in the morning. Then a slow trickle and die throughout the day tomorrow. Kinda like ROKU. might be a decent time to buy low and sell when it’s up about 5-10% on the bounce tomorrow AM
I wouldn’t touch that until it consolidates. Plenty of other longs will be selling in the AM
But why? Why would a bunch of longs sell in the AM down so much?? Wouldn’t they just baghold and hope it goes back up at some point?
Because the market loves to over react. If you think the over reaction today was all the juice this sell off has left, then load up but i don’t see this as a good investment opportunity
Not looking for a get rich quick play. Got some extra dough from the ROKU puts I played yesterday before close… figure might be worth a shot to try to grab an quick couple of bucks if it bounces up before the slow death. If it play like ROKU, I’ll be alright. That thing was DED last night, then shot up at open with people scooping up the dip. Then died for the rest of the day.
Could keep bleeding like snap
What if we’re all NPCs in a hyper-advanced Alien/extra-dimensional being created Free Roam video game and the only reason we haven’t been wiped out en mass is that the map is really big and the psychotic 12 trillion year old Interdimensional squid child playing cosmic-scale GTA hasn’t gotten here yet
I think about this all of the time. We could just be super advanced npc's in a stellaris/gta style crazy advanced video game.
Probably yes but why would you care no one believes you even though I do
Shhhhh they’ll hear you
BABA still polishing their books.
Let’s keep this party going. Everyone tell someone you know to yolo fomo all on qqq / spy. We can push spy to 1000 by end of 2022

Even more fucked than my pton calls
Which are more or less fucked than my DKNG calls?
Didnt Lyft beat earnings? They should be good 👍
Dang still remember avging down on my NVDA position during great recession. Presplit avg of $20s and bought them as low as $6 until I ran out of $.

Sold most in 2012 for a property and remaining few hundred shares in 2017 before it really got going. Didn't even need the money in 2017!

He's a p.o.s. so it's on brand.
Did PENN go down because of this? Since when did the market care about this sorta stuff?

This sub should be all over it!
So do I go bankrupt from DKNG or live another day tomorrow
Well I've seen that down before earnings usually means up afterwards, but hey, maybe you're just unlucky!
C wood loaded up. Which means absolutely nothing at this point.
I’m a buyer again at $40. Held up to 60s and didn’t sell. It’ll be $75 by next year, wait for full seasons of sports earnings to start plowing in. I don’t care about the fluctuation. Just signed nba co-official sponsorship to add to their already announced NHL. To not bet on dkng is to asset two things:

Americans don’t like sports

Americans don’t gamble and upward mobility is great in the society.
Man that chart is a mess I’d expect a lot of volatility as well as lower lows. I could keep going but may PUTS real short term would print
Should I cut my losses on my Pton shares
It’s going back to the 40-50s
Uh yeah (I’mnotafinicalexpert)
Spy up by open 🥰
I haven’t had a memorable red day in a month w t f, rug pull incoming , I just know it. My greedy ass isn’t gonna sell and lock in profits. Going to be regretting it and saying why didn’t I sell
At least you’re self aware.
Set exit stops and adjust as needed.  Think about the panic doubt and decide if you're willing to fuck it up.

Tesla to $1337 is imminent.  Once it reaches $1337, Elon will tweet 'lol 1337 dude' sending the stock to $1420.69.  He will then tweet 'thinking of taking tesla private at $1420.69/share.'  


Blowing my yoload on 11/12 $1335c and $1425c
IF UR ALL IN OPTIONS STOP LOOKING THE MARKET THERS NOTHING U CAN DO U UNDERSTAND
i like the numbers go down like a roller coaster
This market is so broken I bought 5x SPY 12/10 490c and they are up 16% today.  If SPY actually hits 490 by 12/10 I'm cashing out every fund my 401k is in and dumping it all into SPY.
Up 25% on my spy 468 calls for Dec 1st lol
I'm up 240% on F calls this week, but cool story bro.
I already sold my F and GM calls.  Made a decent amount, should have held F longer.
Consider rebuying and holding through the Rivian IPO.
I may on GM, not sure how much more F can run.
Ford owns 12% of Rivian. It might be partially priced in already, but I think it'll move up on IPO day next week. 

Good luck either way.
Was right about PINS
I’m rich FUCK YOU

I skipped the dip but I did buy blue chips
Put buyers🤡

Who are more emotionally retarded, the GMEers or the DWACers?
Both are retarded, but to be fair, at least DWAC can possibly turn into something. Wtf can GME do? Trump really wants his own platform so he’ll push to actually make something happen

LULU and Peloton should merge into one stock called BECKY.
I wonder how the Becky ETF is doing? Use to be a wsb fav
AAPL, TGT, & SBUX are holding it up alright
What was in it
Today was my worst day in 2 weeks because I bet against TSLA and went long Roku before earnings. Don’t be like me
If you bought your TSLA puts at open you should be doing fine though. Did you mean you bought yesterday?
Sold the 1990/1200 call spread. There’s still hope tomorrow
Likely since roku tanked last night.
Zillow gonna go back to 150 next year, now that they’ve realized their mistake and cut it off??
Not unless they toss the management that made that epic terrible decision.
Someone has to go, this was stupid as fuck
Yeah, they will now have to dump 7000 houses at a huge loss and they laid off 25% of their staff. How does no one in upper management get fired?
Nah Open is taking over
maybe in the 80s with the same C levels
Come on TSLA, break 1250 tomorrow
1300*
Lol, I bought calls at 1250 and 1300 right at close.

#Basically no other countries in the world have a “tipping culture”. Seriously. United States is so cucked.
I remember going to socialist France, i asked the waiter if I should tip him


He told me he probably makes more than me and I need that tip for the train.




Really good burger to, the waiter said the cows were happy when they died.
He saw your robinhood account while he was walking by the table
Wow, that would make me reevaluate my life
yeah ... Europe is really overwhelming in that sense.

I really like the fact that despite regulations they seem to have alot more consumer freedoms than we do in the US.

But we have a stock market in the US
I’ve traveled in Europe a lot and love it, but I still have the American superiority complex. I’m mid 30s and have owned a single family house for 11 years, it’s paid off now and have 2 paid off cars. You’d be hard pressed to find any European of similar age to be in that position.  Yet for some reason Europeans do not envy our way of life at all.
Yeah its one of those strange things.

Im not 100% sure why there is a difference in priorities, but I'd rather take the European lifestyle over the stock market anyway.
its started during the depression when business owners could no longer pay there staff enough and we've just held on to do it

same with income taxes started because of the war and we just kept it

once america changes, it doesn't go back
Give them an inch; they’ll take a mile
Fight the system by tipping the busboy $100 and leaving nothing for the greedy waiter.
Systems are based on legacy

Live somewhere else or don't eat in resturants?

Your bill will just increase by 25% if you remove tipping culture you fucking fool
I’ve been all over the world and you couldn’t be more wrong


The owners are
Skirting paying their employees even a basic minimum wage
I have lived all over the world and I am right

Your bill will increase by at least 25% in the USA if you remove tipping culture. Read up on minimum wage and the food service industry in the USA
This is what people don’t understand. They can either price in the tip which is what most countries do without asking, or you can do it yourself. Either way if you don’t tip you’re a dick, I tip 20% for bad service and up to 40% for good service because I respect other people’s hustle
I’m in danger if tesla doesn’t rip in the morning 🤡

Had a fucking argument with my sister at dinner over Peloton. I was like yeah so the stock fucking tanked this company sucks ass and she defended them tooth and nail. Nice dinner though.
Does she own one and feel personally accountable for how overpriced their shit is, creating a sense of defensiveness to justify her blowing her life savings on an exercise bike?
I think you probably nailed that one.
Yes

Nancy Pelosi is standing in the way of Big Tech reform, insiders say

\- NY Post
So she has calls on Big Tech
How about BIGC?
Probably true, but fuck the NY post.
Why? It’s just a tabloid paper

Fuck the nytimes for having a bias too
Why what? Pelosi trades stocks and has the power to keep her best interests in mind, we need these people to not have the ability to play the market while deciding new bills dictating how it works.
You said fuck the ny post
Because fuck em, that's why.
Honestly I’m a pretty good and accurate judge of character and portnoy always gave me the vibe of a sexual deviant. But it takes two regards to do the regard tango, whatever women were hanging around him were doing it because of the money. But portnoy is for sure a fuckboy.
Any millionaire playboy is.. they get bored with normal shit, it's human behavior. We can't begin to relate because we're not famous millionaire playboys. He's 44 and 19 and 20 year olds are fucking him and complaining later? Whatever. They know what they're getting themselves into.
I’m independently wealthy but I don’t use money for stupid shit. Only thing I splurge on is fine dining. That’s my vice. Everything else I’m frugal with because I want to own more stonks. Most people are just animals, not humans at all. Self control is stronger than control over others.
Agreed. 

I've got a few beans stacked away, but if I had over 100 M's.. I think I'd be a bit different. Maybe not.. who knows.
I’d be walking around the world helping random people while traveling tbh.
I'd be fucking 19 and 20 year olds and spitting in their mouths during sex.

It’ll have to be a mass drowning.
La Palma is that you???
Bombs it is then.

But nobody believes in ISIS anymore. Who do you blame that on?
Reptilians
Don't fuck with a komodo dragon
The current move is to paint conservatives as domestic terrorists. Those are the false flags right now. Look at what happened last week with the tiki torch people. False flag got busted so they claimed it was always meant to be found out... It wasn't. Shit like rallys where only feds show up, or the Gov Whitmer kidnapping where all the people the arrested were "informants."


The gun confiscation mass shooting false flags are on hiatus. Eventually they'll probably combine both intentions tho.
Damn that's a lot of terrorists when the "election" was almost 50/50
If this happens today I’m showing this to the FBI
Good luck. I'm in the CIA. We've been plotting this for a long time.
Which one of you retards YOLOed into SPY before close?
ALGOre
Whoever it was, you trashed my UVXY calls
Whoops bought some spy puts for tomorrow. Probably run by the Wendy’s tonight see if I can make my money back between the dumpsters.
Get in line pal... I called dibs on the dumpster tonight!
God dammit sold my calls 1 min too early before close
Bought a bunch of $464p 0DTE right before close... Giving hand jobs by the dumpster later tonight if anybody is interested... 🤡

PTON must have murdered more kids after hours.
My wife's pton puts printing
I knew I should’ve bought that PINS dip.
"Omg guys RKT mooning!" 

*checks* 

+1.5%
Right, I got excited cause I’ve got 40x 11/19$18c but it is up right before earnings call so guessing it will be a beat.
gg NET.. I'm never doubting a 80% monthly run again. banned soon, have fun gentlemen.

Pton has raped me
#F
CNBC is burying Peloton for choosing growth over profits. This company CUT THE PRICE earlier this year and now it's drilling 25%, lol, stick a fork in it.
It’s literally still crashing. Lmao
Why is PINS even up, red by the morning
Excited to see all the PTON and SQ gains and losses tomorrow.
I'm going to buy calls on a inverse (2x) etf. I belong here.  


edit: 2x not 3x
Sqqq?
even dumber: SKF
Keep dying pton don’t come back up! I already booked an omakse
Alright I know indexes have been rallying but like 4 companies deadass dropped 25% on earnings this past week and a half, bears should have *nothing* to bitch about.
Yea there’s been plenty of great shorting opportunities for bullshit companies that are now being judged as they should be
Some of them were obvious too, INTC! PTON! 

Ffs if you’re a bear how do you miss those
INTC is not a bullshit company and is green today …
That’s great, it also dropped like 12% on earnings because it’s losing market share, which was very much expected.
Well SPY probably hitting 500 EOY
I hope so, have (50) calls on it.
RKT to 12 dollars drill begins
*doubt*
**NET:**

>pumps 100% in a month leading up to ER

>adds $30B in market cap (total $63B)

>reports $172M revenue basically in line with expectations (/w a $107M net loss)

>pumps even more

🤡🤡🤡 I feel like I’m taking crazy pills
They're overvalued af rn
Wouldn't be surprised to see it down tomorrow. The run is coming to an end soon.... hard to time exactly though, lol.

Thinking about multi-month puts soon
Thank god my puts expire in January. I’m still gonna get IV crushed but might be able to salvage something.
50% revenue growth on 110 ev/revenue isnt going to cut it.  There basically growing inline with expectations yet the stock has more than doubled.  I never bought puts or shorted because it was too obvious.   Great company tho  and maybe markets will be correct in hindsight a decade from now.
you and me both brother, my puts have failed greatly.  
im tapping out until the next crash, whenever that may be.
Same. Buying puts on anything in this market even the shittiest most overvalued companies is a waste. Instead I’m just going to build a spreadsheet of companies I think will crash the hardest when the bull market ends and wait til then. Starting with NET, DASH, TSLA, HOOD, etc. Any I’m missing?
A hot doctor touched my feet today, I have no torn ligaments in my ankle, and I made some money today ✅✅✅
The PTON puts aren’t actually printing nearly as good as I thought. Like yeah it’s a ten bagger but the damn things were expensive so you couldn’t go balls to the wall on the ones waaay far out.
I only get out of bed for 20 baggers
Lol oh no ten baggers on expensive puts that’s the worst
it is if you wanted 100 of em. usually they are <100 per for fucking 25% otm

BYND's were like 0.10 for 15% move and we know that company is ass
Eating dick on my GME 250c, selling the last 3 shares Ive been holding since January to try and offset the loss.  No more fomo
When i feel sad i just come here and see the notifications where people still believe amc to 200k and gme still has potential to squeeze🤡

Earnings season: ok CHGG I know what you can do you can be the boom operator 

CHGG: but I thought PTON was the boom operator 

PTON: DID SOMEBODY SAY BOOM
PTON was trading $35 back in Nov 2019 when they were still eating bats in China. 

Isn't this oversold?
2019 was fucking 20 years ago
It's 65 rn not 35 there's more to go
Some people have left the gym permanently.  They've even moved out to the countryside away from the city.

Yeah long term it may very well head back there, but still oversold atm
Why are the gme and amc charts practically identical
The venn diagram of people trading it and the chart psychology is a circle
Highly correlated due to the retard factor
Because Ken Melvin Citadel III is stealing your money and the share price for each should be $78 trillion, right 🦍?
> No, but it is $78 trillion.
I think I broke visualmod
Because stupid tards trade both simultaneously
I was more thinking out loud but all still great answers
Again mr mm if you could pump Tesla again that’d be nice. If we get a split we all make even more money. Think about it.

I think Tesla is shorting Apple and Apple is pumping the fk out of Tesla and then gonna do a mass sell off to cause a drop in confidence in Tesla, all because Apple wants an iCar.
Apple can’t make cars.
There's an interview of Elon knowing that Apple is hiring over a 1000 engineers to make an iCar, and another interview of Elon saying that he knew Bill Gates has a short position on Tesla.
Apple tried to build a car while back. 

Car manufacturing is very difficult. Catching up with a market leader like Tesla is a whole different challenge. 

VW a s struggling yo catch up.
You are correct in that there is very clearly big money doing shit behind the scenes with TSLA.

It's why I hold nothing long term and realized all tsla gains.

Fuck that unpredictable shit, I'm just here to make enough money to support my 10 OF girlfriends. Paying 3k a month to each for foot pics is fucking expensive.
F, DKNG, AMD calls I’m holding overnight. Pray for 🚀

Yo! AMC selling popcorn outside theaters. Will it still cost $10?

What’s the news with TSLA

And? That was known
Out of momentum
Pissing me off fosho
Keeps going up
It goes up everyday
Why do nobody of y’all told me to buy pton puts before earnings? Im disappointed
Everyone here was saying to buy puts lmao
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Bought PYPL today!
F
Love me some F
CRSR here we go…
CRSR is going to do fuck all until it breaks $30 with enough volume to overcome the absolutely insane selling wall it will encounter.
Stop it. PTON is dead already
One of these days I'll act on my conviction... That shit was dead man walking and I still didn't smash it w/ the puts.  I hate me
I was thinking the same thing in August but I've literally never bought puts before and generally hate betting against companies, especially companies that have potential. Literally holding myself back from making money, fuck.
we kick the dead around here
Pls
Fuck, I need to add puts to my repertoire. All these stocks like PTON, SNAP, ZG having -30% stock and I’m not capitalizing off of that. Everyone here wants to be a permabull and shit on 🌈🐻’s. I’m just trying to get rich.
>I’m just trying to get rich.

Strongly recommend a safe boomer ETF, for you I mean.
Same... I feel like I'm missing out on it lol. Making money but could be making a lot more ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
How we doing this evening wsb?
I tried to wear pants without underwear and clipped my nuts on the zipper. Hurts like hell.
Just fucking dandy. Why do you ask?
Pretty groovy, got jambalaya cooking and the house smells great
Just playing with this gun in my mouth, the metal tastes like those lead chips I used to eat from the playground, and the brain damage, and the brain damage, and the brain damage.
Could be better if I wasn’t working lol. Sold off my NVDA call at 400% instead of letting it run to like 2500%. Would have just taken the rest of this week and next week off. How about you?
So far so good. You dont go broke from taking profits though.
Did anyone have a sizeable call position on peloton expiring tomorrow or next week? Zips pants..

u/cashflow_ don’t worry about the haters man, we at Metaverse Gang won’t allow these *cyberbullies* into the Metaverse, their days are numbered
WSB metaverse will totally be a safe space. We promise ;)
WSB metaverse better be full of boats n hoes
You know it baby
Thanks buddy. No meta verse Nikes for them
Gonna go take a nice Metaverse shit
Do you work for FB or something? You’ve been shilling metaverse all day everyday.
I’ve been “shilling” Metaverse for literally like 3 days, I just exited a huge position in QCOM and entered one in FB. 

I’m more talking about the Metaverse concept in general than “Meta Platforms”/FB. 

You could just as easily play AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, AMD, QCOM…etc. for the same exact play. Any big tech that works in IoT with huge amounts of data, and anyone who would be integral in supplying the hardware for an explosion of smart devices. 

I just think FB is undervalued currently with the recent correction, which is why *I’m* playing them right now.
Nah it’s just so regarded we know it’s gunna go up. People are regarded and like regarded stuff. All the DD we need here have a ROCKETSHIP 🚀🚀🚀
Imagine not realizing everyone here is a poor. Especially u/vacationlover1
🙋🏻‍♂️
shout out to the cult!
Which one?
There are quite a few
HCP is going public. I plan on selling everything I own and throwing it into there. They are the backbone of many companies and with shareholders to motivate are going to easily be worth 40b. With today's market, that means 400b.
I saw 10 billion on yahoo but still that’s an interesting one. Nice find retard. Any idea of when the IPO will happen or still too early?
u/cashflow_ the type of dude to wash his hands before peeing
It’s my money maker I have to take care of it
I mean, think about it.  My dick’s not dirty, but my hands are.
Just watched s1 of a show called Halt and catch fire, any tech guys here? Highly recommend
I’m not a tech guy, but I play one on TV.
Oh yeaa? Whats your tv name
I’m Rami Malek. I’m Señor Roboto
You are actually a shitty actor and I sincerely hope you’ve spoken with your doctor about your thyroid problem

RIP
Mind to elaborate?
Don’t do puts much, but tomorrow I’ll get a couple PTON, fuck it.
PTON is now very highly shorted and desirable to the WSB crowd. Jk, it’s not. *yet*
best advice you’re going to hear all day. 

If retail trading activity keeps ramping and all these options get bought, HOOD will rise as it’s not currently priced in. they provided piss poor projections for year end revenue. Some 1/21 35c are only 2.70 as of market close today. You’re literally paying 0.70 of premium for 78 days!
The number of people with accounts actually declined in the last quarter, so this isn't a great idea.
that’s the point, as trading activity picks up and those throwaways come back trying to get in on the action, bet against me on the other side of the trade
1//21?
yes, we never use the year
Man this week has been great for shit posting with meta, zillow now pton...thank you corporate america for entertainment
Should I buy PTON calls in the morning? Or, instead of that, should I buy PTON calls in the afternoon?
Be careful. They revised a whole year of guidance. Might keep tanking
It's a cult, and Cathie will buy.
Debatable. Could run up at open, but IV gonna be fucked. Or, could continue dying at open, and then climb a bit later in the day. But IV be fucked there too. Decisions decisions.
Of course it is debatable. That is the very purpose of this forum.
Because of IV, instead of calls I’d suggest buying shares if you think price will go up. Probably a better chance of making 5-10% on shares if you buy early and there is a small run-up tomorrow, versus the IV crush you will feel. 

This thing could continue bleeding out though from PM into open and throughout the day. Hasn’t found a good support level yet
Afternoon
Close positions, buy more naked LCID puts
Gonna dump tomorrow on open
Why is F so cheap
Cheap for a reason

Same reason TSLA is expensive ;)
This made sense because because it makes no sense
Vote tomorrow on infrastructure

It’ll happen and they’ll have their excuse to sell off 🧐
All my sports bets are fucked rn and my DKNG puts tomorrow will probably be the same
I have 2 months income in dkng calls, so i love you as a friend but hope your puts are fucked
I bet moneyline Jets then the Colts just had to kill Mike White on me
You are going to get them back with your puts i am with you
Dow futures will be green in about an hour. Spy should open 472 area

So what you're saying is that I can only bet that a stock will go up if I put in a higher amount than the current price or bet that it will go down if I put in a lower price? I can't make a bet on whether that guy buying $50 AMC weeklies will lose money by betting on if it will be under $52 after earnings?
The first night in awhile that comments haven't been overwhelming bullish. Scary for my calls.

Although it may seem like the market is topping out, this is actually the new bottom.

#ANYONE ELSE DOING PTON PUTS TOMORROW?
I think they'll run it to the ground into the 30s
congrats I thought about it but Im too late now :(
I’m buying some tomorrow, do you think it’s a good idea?
Might be wiser to the next weeks puts in case tomorrow is big green on Spy

About 30 minutes should be sufficient.

What's a safety net?

Get out your boggle shaker and pick the four corner cubes clockwise starting in upper left.  Your welcome.

Edit: center cube letter determines calls or puts.  Which ever its closer to, C or P, determines the side you take.

Yeah exercise has been the only solution to sobriety- I’ve been hitting the punch bag and weights. I know I’m gonna feel a lot better soon but fuck I clearly been drinking too much as this is some withdrawal lol
Hit those weights and reward yourself accordingly.

PTON GUHH
Looks like it step in front of Alec Baldwin
Somewhere Lebron is staring at his tonal contract and shedding tears after seeing PTON.
Is there some kind of magic formula for getting Level 2 options enabled on Fidelity?  I've applied like 3 times and not gotten it.
I got it on a fresh account as a new customer with no bank account linked or funds added. What answers did you give on the questionnaire when it asked about risk tolerance? Just tell them you're a crazy person who doesn't give a fuck and you should be fine.
> I said I'll take all the risk and that it's not a problem.
~~That's weird, I did this less than 2 weeks ago and had no problems.~~

Edit: actually, I just checked (I haven't transferred my assets over yet, things are too spicy right now to risk a few days inaction), and it looks like they only gave me level 1. Guess I'm closing my account. Fuck you Fidelity. I could've sworn they sent me an approval email for level 2, but the email just says "Approved for options trading" and I didn't realize they'd only approved level 1.
I think I said max risky the first time i did it.  I just filled it out again and picked "growth" thinking maybe if i came off more conservative they'd let me play in the sandbox with the other retards.  I said 6 years of experience and 50-100k net worth, 30-50k liquid.
Yeah, have money. Need a lot of net worth.
I put in 50-100k networth, 30-50k liquid.  I've got 38k in Fidelity alone, seems like they ought to let me play in the sandbox with all the other retards.
Liquid is too low. Edit. It also includes any retirement account you have.
WTF just happened to Uber
The market is severely punishing underperformers
Just gonna hold these MSFT and F options until they stop printing
And NET keeps going..
PINS did good. Will market ever forgive PINS and PYPL?
I regret selling NET 😂
Same 😭
Please rkt and pins fly to a measly 100% up. Thanks
Highest overall account value since May 26th 🥳

Thanks to the guys who supported my decision to buy some Datadog yesterday
BNTX is so oversold for no reason all because of MRNA. Who tf do these retards hitting the sell button think MRNA is losing vaccine business to? They’re gonna crush earnings come Monday because that vaccine is JPOWs printer in a shot
Why is no one talking about portillos
PTON was obvious but the last time I bought PUTS for an obvious play I barely escaped
PYPL close above 240 tomorrow and I will get a pumpkin and try to insert it in my butt.
you were probably going to do that anyways

Pton with the classic dehorned bull pattern.

Lol NET wtf
Got stuck holding the bag..
PTON. What. A. Dump.
This $260/245 SQ iron condor pays out 3x eod tmrw if it’s within that range. Dancing on the edge holy sheet.

How do you come back from something like this where requirement was pennies away
I’m over here laughing right now. My portfolio is down 66%(sub 10k now), and I was gonna yolo my entire account into this play, but I can’t help but to smile.  It really wasn’t my time lol🤷🏾‍♂️. There will be another play
Just yolo spy puts tomorrow
HAS $PINS REPORT YA'ALL?
Yes. They beat
this meat ?
No. NNN
I honestly do not fucking get the drop in PTON. Yea it missed its EPS and Revenue estimates bot not by much. Also revenue increased compared to prior year quarter you know the Covid quarter when these things were flying of the shelf. 25% drop makes no sense. The fuck were the expectations.
Tech company expectations with exercise equipment numbers
Do what Tesla does but wit bikes and dykes
They slashed guidance and lost more money than expected
Went with UBER and TSLA FDs 10 minutes before market close. GUH
Bruh, nothing beats that FSLY earnings crash of last year. Lmfaooooo

When does BABA announce earnings?
Honestly there’s no need to even pay attention to baba earnings, they will always beat, always keep making more money, they have hegemony over the most profitable market in existence. You just buy baba when you can add more you don’t sell it
Yeah definitely but I think its begging for a catalyst to move the stock. Its going down and sideways forever.
The catalyst is that it’s worth 300 a share lol. EPS next year will be at least 13 and in 2023 it will be no less than 17. In 2030 it will earn over 50 per share. That’s the catalyst
When Xi steps down
Xi probably water boarding Jack Ma right now

I thought $PINS earnings would be better tbh.
At least they’re not down afterhours. That’s a win
guess these ABNB 180c jan 2023 leaps are going to be ITM in 2021 lol

shoulda went higher out i guess
So was NET just that massively undervalued a month ago?!
Makes like double the revenue of FSLY but like 12xs the market cap so massively overvalued imo but market dont care.
Cathie bought ZM.

She bought Z and DKNG and both fell.

Now PTON tanking and WFH stocks in question.

Could we see same thing happen to ZM soon?

ZM market cap is still $83bn... plenty of room to fall to get to a reasonable valuation...
When was the last time you saw a reasonable valuation
Fair lol.  

Probably only a handful of stocks like that in the whole market.
Schools and businesses are using Google Suite (including Meet) more nowadays too. I think ZM falls but I’ve also been here for over a year and am still not rich so it’ll prolly run lol.
Cathie is clearly autistic with her 4000 price target on TSLA 😂
ZM has been making higher highs and higher lows for weeks now. Its def trending upwards and just needs one piece of good news to fly.
Uranium the move 💁🏻‍♂️
Ok course RKT fucks me.

Made a decent amount today - holding some positions and considering cutting (big) losses on BARK (bought when it was STIC) and CLOV. More faith in CLOV in the next 5 years than BARK. 

&#x200B;

I just hate selling shares for a fat loss, I'd rather have my options expire worthless.
Free up that powder to put in plays that will pay now! The value you’re losing is more than the -%, it’s the missed compounding gains. Sunk cost fallacy is a bitch.
100%. I might just sell at a loss and lob into SPY leaps and make back the losses on that, break even and then have fresh powder for plenty of other plays.
Seems good ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)

My personal account. I'll double it and give you 75%, I promise
That coin that were not allowed to mention because mods don't want you to make money

I second NVDA, if you can any tech really spy and Tesla too
How much does dkng tank even more tomrw ??
Honestly fuck fidelity...I was going to buy a bunch of puts in peloton, but they constantly fuck with me from level 1 to level 2....I tried getting my 18 year old son authorized on my account to learn, but they fucking suck
fidelity is the worst
Gotta have margin with fidelity
Come to Schwab, it’s nice in here
Man AMD hurts. Just cause I really wanted to take a large position but had too many other opportunities I liked. Barely didn't make the cut.
It sucks to watch that stock disappoint for months but honestly once she runs, she runs big 😍
Yeah I owned it from like 40 to 105, but sold it all to rebalance back in September.
My highest convictions: DDOG and DDD all the Ds my way. Doing the thing AH
Update: the $1.7 Trillion Tax Bill is headed for a vote with the “kitchen sink” added back in, seems to keep mods and rads happy everybody gets everything they have dreamt about except for one problem, those who oppose it and killed it last time,  with the kitchen sink taken out of the bill.....still oppose it and plan to kill it again. Wall Street is losing patience!

Oh you fuk probably
Is PINS gonna drop after earnings?
They already had earnings. They beat.
Yup fuck my 45p..
>PINS gonna drop after earnings?

it beat...
Maybe I shouldn't feel so bad about my RKT 19c. They beat earnings, the dip wasn't bad, and its back green. Maybe they'll be ok. Maybe I'm delusional.
IV crush
Managed to get out with profit on NVDA at the tippy top. Ty trailing stop loss. Zillow puts on the other hand....
$ME is on a run!! Let’s gooooo
Can some one that is not as retarded as me do some good DD on GPRO it beat earnings and I want to buy some leaps.
Has anyone ever taken out a loan to run the wheel or just sell csp’s? Got 11k saved to dump into my student loans in February but I’m fairly confident I could pull 1% ($100) a week selling csp’s if not up to 3-4% (300-400). Wouldn’t be much in just a few months but also thought of taking a loan for the same amount
> No.
[deleted]
Oh I know, I’m sitting on calls thatre over 200,300,400% etc. just thinking of trying to get back to a safer investment strategy to earn a little more. Wouldn’t want to sell anything that’s below like 80% chance to profit. If only get like 1-3k by feb so idk if that’s worth the risk honestly
Lol try it and found out. Sounds fun until you get blown the fuck up. Just remember that there is often no defined loss in Theta gang.
Yeah I’ve done some before. Think I’d be leaning more towards safer stocks that stay in trends. Was playing F for a while before it started moving up and now I just hold shares. LUMN, T, RKT (before it fell) just generally “safer” stocks
[deleted]
It’s a separate saving account. Been out of school 11 months and been putting 1k a month into that account. Better to have the money saved for the students loans than not having it to pay before 0% interest ends. Also didn’t want to pay the loans in the very off chance they do forgive them by feb
1%/week is like 60% annualized. It will work until it doesn’t. When it doesn’t you’ll be assigned a bunch of shares at a loss.
Cry in the corner
Same, loading up on $TEARS.
SoFi with the sympathy dump
Uber green tomorrow ?
I would have better chance if I just rolled the dice. I was sure that Etsy and Net will go red... And here we go. Besides TSLA I am not sure of other stock being as expensive as net.
The way some other stocks plunged in red is also hard for me to understand.
Earning seasons are making me more and more humble about my knowledge and understanding of the markets.
more knowledge = more losses.  
to win like a retard, we must think like retards.
Fun fact: SQ profit margin is 3.60%. V profit margin is 51.07%. The more you know ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
SQ about to break out somehow still tomorrow just like it did last earnings the next day.
I maybe fucked. Had 3 calls and closed red by hoping it would go up after hours.
So will $PINS go back to $60 soon ?

Looking good. Definitely missed out I didn’t pick up more off that stupid short report. Been  it in since the early days
Caught it at $30 and then sold it when it went parabolic, but didn’t have anywhere near the shares I wanted.

Can’t wait to buy DDOG calls tomorrow
I would actually short Datadog. A lot of people have been waiting to take profit on them, and I think it’s gonna happen tomorrow if not on Monday.
I know we’re a gambling forum but DDOG needs to be like Okta and use their overvalued stock to make some acquisitions.
Looks like Jim Chanos makes money for the first time this year
[Hopefully some people saw this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlcs16/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_november_03_2021/hj1yzpw/?context=3) exchange and made money. I know at least one of you fuckers is out there.
Wish I did. Nice call.
I sold all my NVDA calls yesterday and rolled into TSLA. Lots of pain today, but I’m still certain TSLA hits 1300 by next week (this week?)
The good thing about next week is that it's always a week away
20x $265’s sold at close yesterday. Man oh man….
Why? Everything was pointing to NVDA still going up, I didnt except this crazy rally, but I knew it was inevitable to keep going up.

You took a certain bet to make money, with a chance of crazy gains, and decided to put it on another bet that had a smaller chance of crazy gains, less certain chance of making money, and more certain chance of losing.

Your strategy is very very bad. You need to re-evaluate how you pick your calls.
So that could’ve been around $80-$90k in profit oh man
Heart breaking
OOF.
Dayummmmmm PTON got prolapsed. Who bought over $160 last year???

Missed out on $15k gains on AMZN.  Sold my 3350C Nov and 3500 December yesterday. Still made profit, but seeing those missed gains sucks dick.
Nobody went broke taking profits.
but i want hookers and yachts
Then be smarter.
Nobody wins a yacht by being a pussy either though.
Yea but you can eat an elephant one bite at a time.
I sold my 3450 when AMZN was up $60 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)

Made 2500 though 🥰
I understand the portnoy hate, but saying penn is doomed is naive. His followers are only getting more money and more energy
Sell all the SPY weeklies I bought this morning. I mean, win or lose, it would be hilarious if I got assigned them.
Confused.... if you got assigned on purchased calls???
u/cashflow_ Did you buy UVXY puts today?
He says he ain't 🌈 anymore 🤷‍♂️
Should I sell my SPY 11/19 calls tomorrow or hold them?
What strike price?
I have SPYG $71 and $72 strikes. It’s already at 71.40+
SPYG?
It’s a cheaper version of SPY. ETF
Yeah I know what it is, I'm just speechless.
Why?
If you have a gain in it, maybe sell them and buy the same amount for the same date at a slightly higher strike price. That way you still win if it keeps going up, but hold some profits if it doesn't.
Hold bitch
Hold
Why?
SPY gonna keep running till end of Jan

Being that SPY continuously breaking new highs what our mark at the end of the month? Any thoughts?
Spy 900 anything less is bearish.
I think we get to 475/480ish then a slight pullback in the last week of November

At least, thats what the options im buying are for
Let’s circle back to this I have SPY calls at strike $490 expiry DEC 3rd 🥉
Down 👍

Rn ive just got 468s and 469s for 11/12
In the green noiceeeeee and fu but congrats 🎉
Ty, its been a good week for me haha 🥳
Trynna to make my gains back from AMCS calls being gangraped this week SPY is the way
SPY with a dash of momentum plays (only like 10% of my account, but hey got to swing trade nvda today) are the way 😁
Broooooo so this am I saw the gap up and I purchased one call but then I saw it was dipping after the run up so I sold it, I then go look 20 mins after and it’s on a run again lmfao what are the odds but yes congrats to everyone who got into NVDA today!
473 probably
If we continue through 466, then I can see low to mid 470s
EOM = Spy $669
I’d cum and quit my job if it did
Dont forget to Answer the phone tomorrow PTON bulls
*scam likely* Nah, I’m not picking that up
I should post my loss porn for being just beyond retard from buying YOLO SPY 462 puts yesterday, and STILL bought more 465 puts. down 80%
How does one lose 25% on shares in one single grade. God I’m rerarded
Had to choose between F and DK. I fully expect the one I didn’t pick to blow tomorrow
Which did you choose? I’ll rose some Monopoly money at the other
I’m thinking of selling some spy calls is anyone interested
I’ll buy.
I'm feeling SQ calls at open. and sell like 2 hours later
So FB and MSFT gonna flirt with same price I see.
NTR looks like its being shorted..it got 3 upgrades in the past week and its still getting hammered..who wants to shovel some horseshit???
bro, don't tell me there's a stock called NTR, gonna buy some at open.
Nutrien; the biggest fertilizer provider in the US w/ \~20% global market share. They beat top and bottom on 11/2 and raised guidance. Price targets are between $80-85 and it's down over 5% since it released earnings. 3 upgrades in the past two days! Makes zero sense except for someone shorting them.

McPlant sounds like a MCD corporate office   whistleblower
> The McDonald's Company (NYSE: MCD) is an American multinational fast food company headquartered in the Oak Brook, Illinois suburb of Chicago. It was founded in 1940 as a barbecue restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald; In 1948 they reorganized their business as a hamburger stand using production line principles. Businessman Ray Kroc joined the company as a franchise agent in 1955..
For real for real?
Yep, made with beyond meat patty as well. Might buy some shares tomorrow
Those beyond meat patties taste like old sweaty dr scholl’s insoles. I really don’t get it.
Yo bro I think ate them when they were just starting out, I had some of their stuff back in 2020 I think, and it was fucking disgraceful. They got so much better now, give it a try when you get a chance
Hm ok. I shall give it a try again.
Is that like a Big Mac with weed?
For people who don't eat meat but miss maccies from time to time? Yeah almost as good lol
> "A study of more than 6,000 people in the UK found that vegetarians are almost twice as likely to be depressed or anxious compared with meat eaters. The researchers said this may be because they miss out on vital nutrients such as B12 and zinc."

So what exactly makes fds print so hard so fast compared to like 90 dte? Gamma?
Less premium paid. If both options go up by $1, the one you paid less for has a larger % gain. But also gamma is higher yes.

More than PTON for sure
Question: does IV crush still affect my deep in the money calls/puts? Day of expiration
not as much but yes
Technically yes functionally no, deep ITM will trade w very low extrinsic which is the only portion ever subject to IV crush.
Rip
IV contributes to price through theta. With only 1 day left it will affect it by the factor of that 1 day
If you have PTON puts, you'll be fine
No. On close of day of expiration only the intrinsic value matters. At open, it’ll have some time value left but not much if it’s deep ITM
Didnt buy SPY calls today, but I did sell puts on the Dow Jones

OK I am not smart enough to understand this. I need some moons or rockets or something.

I get that tesla had huge short volume today. - I mean why not the thing is more valuable than 4 walmarts and can't produce cars fast enough to fill orders \*(Is that good or bad?)

&#x200B;

But how do you interpret this? Does a company having huge short volume one day indicate a huge price change is coming in the following days? - I didn't realize there are people dumb enough to short tesla. \*I am very very dumb but not crazy enough to short tesla.

Any good inflation stories lately?
I have a full set of a 1998 Hot Wheels Super Highway 2 track, that I think is now worth $500

Is this inflation? ✋🦋

I had one but sadly it was transitory
I had to give an employee new hire a twenty percent raise. We do not make big money. The employee now makes more then I do.
My wife bought 20lbs of good quality Boston butts for $20 yesterday. She keeps on buying a ton of meat because it's cheap and we throw it in the freezer "because meat is so expensive" and "who knows what will happen?". 

Personally I don't see the inflation. Yes, gas is expensive. Materials for work are expensive. But my job buys my gas and materials. My groceries cost less than they did a year ago. My fast food lunches cost the same as they did a year ago. Coffee pods cost the same as they did a year ago. Clothes may cost a little more, but fuck I can usually find something good quality in my price range. Maybe I pay 5© more for Christmas gifts than I did last year. Maybe it's less? But I don't feel stupid for not having bought Christmas gifts 8 months in advance. 

Inflation honestly does seem to be transitory. It seems like a narrative that's getting fed to the populace.

I inflated my dick about 5 minutes ago.... oh wait its deflating now 😏

Been bird-dogging it this week and last because I bought some calls.  It's thinly traded - some days it doesn't move all of 10,000 shares - and the spread is always big and always wonky.    The calls are even worse.

My customer was claiming she thinks it’s from fur trader times lol
I have beaver in the game bro
It could be. I'm pretty sure it's north American in origin and furs were traded as currency prior to gold being found. It's a decent guess at least. I could see fur trades gambling for entertainment when leaving the Backcountry and running into other traders.
foreskin?
I got some skinflute in the game

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_(phrase)
**[Skin in the game (phrase)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_\(phrase\))** 
 
 >To have "skin in the game" is to have incurred risk (monetary or otherwise) by being involved in achieving a goal. In the phrase, "skin" refers to an investment (literal or figurative), and "game" is the metaphor for actions on the field of play under discussion. The aphorism is particularly common in business, finance, and gambling, and is also used in politics.

Sometimes otherwise volatile stocks oscillate in price within a channel in periods. Iron Condors can profit handsomely off of this.
Oh, like TSLA between 1200 and 1240?  Ok, doing it.
Or last year. TSLA oscillated nicely and easy money was made.
Every time I take a piss, I think about valley forge, and the fact that our founding fathers were scavenging corpses for teeth

When TQQQ was trading at 120 in September in sold a 130/140 put credit spread for a large credit just because I thought we would bounce and IV was high. Closed it out when TQQQ hit 142 in October because I thought we might be topping out short term. Now it’s at 170 wtf

What yall think about QCOM puts? They run up bigly for earnings and kill it then tanks or you think it'll keep running up?

It’s a semiconductor stock, unless you’re making a pairs trade you don’t want puts in that space, too much momentum to fight the trend
If you look at QCOM they always run after ER but drill down after to 120-130 range

I've been pulling in 20k a day for the past 2 weeks.


Consistency>one big lottery win.
I made $200 a day this week and feel like a fucking baller

Congrats and fuck you
Over the phone I gave my friend plays I was seeing on the market that I couldn't enter and made him about 5k this week, he woulda made more but he got greedy and held calls. 

It's a lot easier when you experiment and follow your own intuition.
Can you tell me about your strategy, which indicators you use, and which chart timeframe you look at?
I literally just read news, check prices daily, know price trends, industry price trends, check volume, find opportunities depending on whats going on etc.

Its all off the fly based on what I feel and my knowledge of the market.

I play only big companies NVDA, Apple etc. 

After 2-3 months I felt comfortable knowing the market cuz I experimented so much, and knew how to pick my call strikes/dates etc.
Ok gotcha. Idk why but sometimes I struggle with finding setups and executing on them. I look at the technicals more than fundamentals
Which means he doesn't know shit. It's a casino and we're all just players at the table.
You need to buy cheap ass calls, the 10 dollar ones that are so far out of the money and experiment that way.

Track it and imagine if you had chosen a closer call next time if you find the same opportunity.

I started with only 100 dollar bets, until i felt confortable to go up to 1k a bet. Now i'm up to 2k a bet. 

I'm here for the long term, not short term get rich quick.

You can change your life. I started with 2k and if I lose all my money I know as long as I have enough to buy a call, I can build up wealth.
You have a money printer at home ?
Naw, I just used my intuition and played all the big tech right.
I've made 150k in the last 3 weeks mostly just holding LEAPS.
CHASDAQ about right at that trendline it has consistently without fail sold off. 

Not calling a crash but the probabilities favor the downside at this point. 

It could also form a new higher trend line too. We shall see
So up or down? Well I’ll be damned.
So youre saying theres a 50/50 chance of up or down?

Thanks for the insight
Imagine still not realizing that Tesla will easily be the largest company in the world mid decade

Don’t like the guy but did he do anything illegal?
One of the women alleged he raped her.
Disagree.  It’s an article in business insider and at worst the women aren’t saying it was nonconsensual simply that they had bad experiences…
One of them literally said she told him to stop and he said no. 

That’s textbook assault. 

And even if he didn’t do it, the plausibility of it will definitely drag the price down in the coming weeks.
His history of virulent misogyny doesn’t exactly help his case, either.
Its ok OCGN. You can go up when you feel like it
Thanks I told her the same thing
#ALRIGHT EVERYONE, PUTS ON PTON TOMORROW 💪🏽💪🏽

It absolutely can go lower
Ask yourself, would you want to pay $3000 then pay to use the machine you bought? If no, then yes.

right guys?? right??
I would never pay 3k for a indoor bike just go ride a real one outside
Honestly hoping for a rebound
This would have been better yesterday!
It feels weird not jerking off tonight. Going to a wedding this weekend with my girlfriend and I don’t want to have a bad combo of jerking off too much and alcohol that’ll make it feel like I’m pushing rope. Always sucks not being able to stay/get hard

I have
You’re married and have had sex with another woman since being married?
Why not :)
Have u really though
I answered you
Depends. Could ruin your relationship. My wife wants to do this with another bloke. There is no way in hell.
Yes. It’s just sex
But a husband and a wife?
If a couple is cool with exploring, why not.
You mean, could a couple have a threesome and not be psychos forever…. Depends on if y’all psycho in the first place.
Depends on what that couple defines as healthy.  If one is submissive to the other’s desires, is that healthy?  What if the relationship is slightly transactional?  Threesome with a woman this time, next time is a man?  Lot of variables.  I think the health is based on defining before the threesome happens

TL:DR, threesome
> A threesome with a woman this time, next time is a man?  Lot of variables.  I think the health is based on defining before the threesome happens

Serious question: If the U.S. went to war again and there was a military draft, would you rather go to prison or would you fight?  


I'd go to prison, I ain't defending this shitshow.
I’d be living with a family of beavers and marinating myself in maple syrup so damn fast 🇨🇦
Kinky
I’d love to get blown up.
We're all autistic so can't get drafted.
We going to prison boys
Same. Not going to die because of a fight some old men start.
Tempting tbh. That’s why people should be responsible and learn how to get the fuck along and not destroy each other, that way we can get the fuck off of earth someday lmao.
I would fight. I get a thrill out of adrenaline rushes anyways.
I'm a few years above the selective service age. So I'd be hoping shit didn't get too bad, all while becoming a Canadian citizen through my wife (she has dual citizenship).
You wouldn't go to prison. They line you up against a wall or swing you from a tree.
I’d love to see them try. There’s real monsters out there
Downvote me all you want, doesn't mean I'm not telling you the truth. Go check out what the Russians did when German got close to Stalingrad.

go to prison lol. do you have any idea how many people would burn their cards on social media?
> I don't care.
Let's set an additional parameter here to spice it up a bit.  Let's say the war wasn't in the Middle East, Africa, China, or Russia but was a foreign power invading the US mainland.  You going to jail or signing up?
Bears, you will be right one day, that day is just not today or any day soon SPY 500
TSLA is clearly overpriced but puts are super expensive. Best EV company to bet against if you think EVs are gonna correct soon?
Puts aren’t worth it, only the shorts who time it right will make money.
You'll never win with weeklies, but I think if this madness continues any longer that something maybe 6months out could be profitable
I picked up an FD $1200 call but chickened out with that closing rally.

Edit: fixed Tesla’s number below lul 

Enron company: one of if not the biggest fraud company in recent history. At one point it traded price to earnings of 70x .

Tesla: trading at above ~~112x~~ 450x price to earnings.


Alarm bells should be ringing
Is this a joke? AMZN traded at 1000 pe for like 10 years
There’s a difference between having a P/E ratio of 500 when you’re earnings are a million dollars versus when your earnings are supposedly “$13.7BILLION”. To justify the P/E ratio currently, Tesla would basically need to have over **triple Microsoft earnings currently** .
Wow your stupidity amazes me.
So the fact that no other electric car manufacturer other than Tesla has P/E ratios of ~500 doesn’t for one second give you doubts? To have a reasonable P/E ratio (of say 50, which is still pretty high tbh) Tesla would need to be earning more than Apple+Microsoft did this quarter. How does this not raise crimson red flags in your mind 🚩??
I really dont have any doubt other than some black swan event. If the fundamentals are effected then id have to make a choice. The P/E actually only makes me more confident. Last year their pe was 1000 by the way.
> Google is a joke.
AMZN IS A BEHEMOTH
Except this quarter lol
It's going to go down just like it did in March 

Tesla's share price is built on options bets
112 PE ratio isn’t even that high??? DIS is 278
Sorry, fixed Tesla’s price to earnings now. It was over 450x lul
It was 2000 last year and not even measurable (because they weren’t profitable) 2 years ago. Even despite its monumental rally. Something tells me there are other more relevant metrics than PE for Tesla.
Is Tesla faking earnings? Maybe they didn’t actually sell any cars. Hmm.
I wouldn’t be surprised if they were faking something. Doesn’t make sense for them to be pumping out earnings beats whilst complaining about chip shortages and factory supply issues
Tesla to 1400 end of next week? Who’s bullish
Banbet that shit
Have a peaceful night you all, best of luck trading tomorrow, have fun.
Somehow losing money feels better than missing out on massive gains.
NVDA TO THE MOOON
TSLA is absolutely fucked.

How can a mega cap company with now 1T market cap be up 122% since mid May without any significant catalysts?

How can it be up 60% in the last month without hardly any news?

What the fuck is going on?
See: NVDA, NET, and literally every fucking thing at ATH.

Literally NVDA's 5 year growth for Metaverse got priced in today. By like 3 times the predicted growth of $10 billion. That's how retarded this market is. After it already went up 30% for no reason....

Same with Cloudflare. Barely fucking beat earnings, up 80% in the past month and goes up another 5% AH. Literally what in the fuck
It’s mostly crazy watching a 1T dollar company melt up like this. I have no positions
But its so insane you cant risk shorting anything.   


This market is so unhealthy all you can do is sit on the sidelines.
No. Fuck no. Do not short TSLA, do not short NVDA, do not short NET

Unless you are talking about a high RSI scalp and get out before you get a hulk dick giant green bounce candle, or just keep the money in the pocket until the time is right...

The planet could be obliterated in 24 hours and NVDA would still be bouncing as the markets crashed
Just buy puts then genius
it’s a free market bud
I’m not complaining. I have no positions. It’s just astonishing watching a mega cap melt up
Bears getting cucked by the chosen one
You are a newb lol.
Market makers are trying to trap as many retails as possible before we get the next downturn.
it’ll come back down, there’s no doubt, but that’s TSLA in a nutshell since forever 


and yes, every parabolic move did consolidate 


eventually…
The fact that none of you understand that there is a very particular segment of blue collar workers that do actual real work and they aren’t going to accept any mandate shouldn’t surprise me. Can truckers afford to lose 10% of their workforce? Can any business for that matter?

Hope you enjoy butchering your own meat, cleaning your septic out and certainly don’t expect your Amazon deliveries on time you spineless fucks.
I'd say a lot more than 10% for many blue collar jobs
This is the truth. 

But also, as a blue collar worker that is vaccinated, I'll take the work. I won't knock anyone for not getting the jab and I think it's stupid that it's mandated. But I take greater risks at work every week than I took getting the vax. It was an easy decision.
I respect your opinion very much and would never hold that decision against you. As you acknowledged either decision shouldn’t be held against anyone.
I agree. No one is factoring in we are going to lose 5-10% of the workforce in every job sector due to vaccine mandates.
Calls it is
Fuck you man
Na man, fuck you
Fucking calls when hard working people are losing their jobs. You are the pig that deserves to be slaughtered. Good luck out there bitch
Boo hoo worker. Get your shot, learn to code, or get those knee pads on.
Jesus man I’m poor to and have to work for living just like you. Calm
Down all your doing is getting stressed out over some made up shit in your head
We share that, we both work for a living. I am not poor and actually have an interest in wealth preservation and a functioning economy 10 years from now and beyond. It’s not made up, check the stats.
Idk if you work your poor too. Anyone who has to work to not got hungry or homeless is poor. Everything else is a illusion.
I disagree with you. That is precisely how you stay poor with that mindset 

There is no illusion to creating and moving real goods. The digital world and tech is your illusion
Na man wealthy people do what they want when they want. That’s it. Everything else is you making someone else rich at the expense of your most valuable resource. Namely time.  Time that’s all we have. If you spend one second of it doing something you need to do to ensure your own well being you’re  someone’s bitch. Period end of story. Get rich or die trying.
If you distill the reality of life on earth, you will realize fending for yourself, making your own shelter and gathering food daily is a far greater time  and energy soak than you face now. If you are into that lifestyle more power to you but you certainly would not be mad at the wealthy.

Its amazing the amount of people who assume the wealthy do nothing. I work with them everyday and that is not the case for the heavy majority.

You need reality man. If you genuinely valued time, you would not be here.
jesus christ, cry more. its a fucking video game.

also that you think you are the only one that understands this, whatadouche!
most annoying thing about this bubble is that there won't be a crash from it. Instead we'll get like 5-10 years of the stock market slowly bleeding out. Because at these prices we've effectively priced in a successful green economy that runs on high-tech. The real economy will just be growing into these ridiculous valuations of equities. Boomers will have their retirements secured while younger generations will be deprived of a solid opportunity to build wealth through stocks
Buy the dip, pussy. Get rich enough that your kids don't have to secure their own future.
I’ll work into my 70s bfd
I can make money off a bleeding market too bro.
Yeah I'm not saying there aren't opportunities, especially with the increased volatility in modern markets. Just saying the situation is pretty suss.
>most annoying thing about this bubble is that there won't be a crash from it

if people expect the stock market to trade sideways or bleed out for 5-10 years then they will all sell and cause a crash, the only reason we buy these garbage ass companies is because we expect some idiot to buy it off us for a higher price
If you don't have anything nice to say about $wish, dont say anything at all
your so retarded do you know how many more people are in the market now? We’re going to be forever volatile, faster crashes, faster runs, that’s how it’s gonna be till we’re dead

Coconut oil def good for lube. Gets everywhere tho.
I wanna threesome with her and AOC. Screw it, foursome and give me Lauren Boebert as well.
What about Jen Psaki?
Me too, but I wanna wear a MAGA hat while doing it
Sometime I'd see two guys here arguing. I'd go and downvote both of them. And they each think the other one did it.
Bro you gonna let him just downvote you like that?
No

Covid has wiped out the FLU. Average Flu deaths  for previous 4 years 350k per year. No Flu deaths in 2021 !! How many supposed covid deaths were actually Flu deaths but government doesn’t give an extra 30k to health care providers for flu deaths so…….

How many shares of GME do you own?

Did you buy them this year?

What is your thesis?
TSLA is just chilling at 1200 lmao that's pretty insane. Some stuff just goes parabolic and just chills now. No retracements allowed!
The fact that you can't repair or buy parts for EVs is one of the things that's keeping me away from them. My shit box has run way past it's useful life because I keep fixing it
Hint - Evs have a fraction of the failure points of a combustion engine
yeah i put a new engine in my 1994 toyota pickup with a big ass tree branch and a chain fall lol
Eventually they’ll all be evs but how do they replace the sweet sound of a combustion engine?
Not everyone is mechanically gifted or have the time to learn that skill. In other words pansys
You all need to understand that the Metaverse concept is *literally, and I am not fucking exaggerating:*

going to be the most revolutionary technological advancement of our world since the internet. 

This shit is *guaranteed* to cause a massive bubble and crash as people try to get in on tech that really won’t be fully developed for 20 years. 

It is going to make us all *fucking rich as fuck*.

Make good picks. Get in early.
Okay I’ve been putting off learning about this shit but you geeking out over it is making me slightly interested. Is there like a brief explanation you’d be willing to give about what exactly it is and why you think it will be such a big deal? If not I’ll just look it up tonight after work I guess but it doesn’t hurt to ask
It’s like IoT taken to the extreme degree. 

I was posting earlier this year about how the next great driver of growth for big tech like AMZN, FB, MSFT, AAPL, etc. will be the growing ubiquitousness of interconnected smart devices, paired with advancing AI/Smart Assistants, VR and AR technologies, and advancements in wireless connectivity, *combining* into what is now being referred to as “The Metaverse”. 

At the time I didn’t have a word for it, I just explained it as “more than IoT, interconnected *everything*.”

The idea of a *smart world*, with the physical and digital worlds integrated seamlessly. 

Think JARVIS meets Ready Player One. 

Yes, I’m referring to pulpy mass media sci-fi schlock, but these depictions of tech are very prescient in reality.

It is beyond inevitable. This tech is in its infancy still and the implications of what we can eventually do with it are mindblowing.
Smartest thing I've read on WSB ever (beside gamestop v1).
I hate when mfs say “it was an obvious play” but they didn’t buy puts..
It’s always obvious after the dildos fall.
Sometimes IV crush fuk u so we just chill
I just want GME to dip back into the 100’s so I can climb back on that train like all them Indian people do
tf?
We gonna act like Indians don’t ride trains?
i mean drive a porshe so...
I imagine that wouldn’t use as much coal
Haven't drank alcohol in forever but I'll probably drink a whole bottle of wine tonight. Missing out on NVDA and AMD gains is really messing with my head.
Can’t win em all champ, chug that bottle like a boss and get back in the arena!
It’s been almost a year since I dumped my girl and left Milwaukee, WI and got on the open road. Didn’t plan on ending up in Texas. It’s been a wild ride.

If you ever see my buddy Mark Borchardt tell him I said hello.
I will, plan on checking out the old stomping grounds sometime soon
I guess I’m going to go the way of Marc Maron and not have kids.

10k in $LCID puts expiring Nov 19th - gonna keep adding 

10k in $FB Dec 17th calls cause boomers like METAVERSE and name change Dec 1st

Had 10k in $OPEN weeklies on $Z dip but sold today for 500% profit 

/end
Persuasive top calling. Hope it works out for you!
I don't even care if TSLA goes higher it's not got much room to go anymore at 1.25 Trillion. I'll wait for the correction
So you saying TSLA running out of Gas.  Wait what they don’t even use Gas.
This is gonna be good. A massive whale purchased tons of contracts next week for tesla 1350c.

Ouch.
Only need a 5% day
#PINS BABY YOU DONE IT 🥳
Maybe another 10% from NVDA tomorrow.
I must say I think it’s really funny that bears keep saying that this market is irrational and then come here to downvote everyone who made money as though that’s a rational thing to do that’s going to help you in any way to recover your money.
I think it’s way more likely that it’s apes or just some whiner than it is bears downvoting because SPY went up .37% today

TSLA, might hit 1500 but at some point in the future it’s gonna hit 1000 again
BB. You prolly should have like 3 days ago…. But it’ll probably bleed out for another 3 months before the next pump
I could definitely sell some CCs at the money.

BB has been pumping and dumping every two weeks lately
Bb and crsr

My only regret is not buying more PTON puts.

Even with IV PTON puts are going to pay out
Saw pton puts easily
PTON.... jesus christ

Yes full send

I mean.... Pretty sure these PTON earnings were expected
Apparently not
Buy more CLOV before earnings

Drill PTON!!
Are we expecting any kind of AMC run up before earnings on Monday?
Not unless retail jumps back in it. Pinned all day = no public interest.

Portnoy is poison
I think he sucks, but I know a lot of people who religiously follow barstool. I think they will do fine in the online gambling sphere because of that. I mean the PE ratio is down to like 20, so starting to look decent.
The game plan is play SPY lottos, hopefully double up, and then play TSLA debit put spreads
Always betting against tsla…
Buy more $tsla?
Peloton flipping bikes, soon to be discontinued
SQ and UBER will be green by open. Others are fuk.
Tomorrow I wake up to SPY at 470   
And book my Lambo appt right away.
Got  burned hard several earnings this season so I'm resign to just watching. Companies that weren't movers now act like they learned how to fly and dive. Companies that used to move now act like three legged turtles
Good idea to short Zoom since PTON crashed?
Remote work is here to stay, but people prefer the smell of women’s hormones in latex instead of watching on a screen.
Into earnings, yeah. It may fall as big money prices in poor earnings as likely. But probably don't hold into earnings because PTON is garbage but people still use ZM.
True, but MS teams will be used more long term....

A shitty video app shouldn't be worth the same as Uber lmao
Idk, my university pays for Zoom even though we have the whole Office suite, Teams included. Zoom works about 100x better than Teams, and for people who do a lot of remote stuff, that's important. Even if the university stopped paying for Zoom, I'd still pay for it when teaching my remote classes. It's definitely the best option. That being said I hope Teams gets better and eventually replaces Zoom.
Can anyone else look up their local AMC and confirm what attendance numbers look like? In my area you can literally rent an entire movie theatre for yourself for $12-$16 on a Friday night. A buddy of mine is a die hard fan of Dune and we bought 3 tickets for tomorrow (Friday) for an 8:55pm showing. This will be our first theatre experience since the pandemic started and as of now, we will be the only 3 people watching that showing of the 81 seats available (excluding handicap). 

If you hold AMC, are you actually going and seeing the movies too? Genuinely curious what attendance looks like in your area If any others could share.
You can also put random theaters in and pretend to buy tickets. No need to buy to reserve seats
This is insider trading
OCGN back to 12 tomorrow. Hoping for a somewhat steady increase back to 15
Bag holder alert! Bag holder alert! Bag holder alert!

Thx lol, I had a feeling it was gonna go down Wednesday to but I just couldn't bring myself to short a meme stock. 
Probably selling at 11 and waiting for it to go back to 9.50 and buying more
Good call bro. I almost bought in at 15🤮 thank god I didn’t. Happy to see you bought at a fair price

Don't switch until it burns when you pee.
I pee out my butthole
It's not supposed to burn?
Wait what....don't start the rumor mill going everybody knows that it is perfectly normal that it burns when you pee, I grew up in the 70's man and I am still normal.

Something tells me you’re not smart
You’re gonna be alright just a little poorer.

Edit: at least you didn’t buy 11/5?
Wait until 9:30 tomorrow. NET has 84% institutional ownership and there’s nowhere near enough liquidity for them to sell AH. At some point MMs need to take profit and retail will be stuck holding the bag.
Ya. I think might hold til next week.
FB call for next week? Good idea? Best idea?

I just got approved to write and sell naked options lol. What's the most profitable move? I think selling OTM weekly calls (to you guys) on companies with earnings coming up is smart. Or just weekly Boeing 190p's
Just gonna say F right now
Yes sell naked calls ahead of earnings. Make sure not to hedge them or turn into spreads. That’ll eat into your profits.
Please keep us updated with how this works out
Naked puts/puts on margin are the way to go. Asking as you don’t get assigned, don’t have to pay margin rates 

Also poor mans covered calls and sell more than 1 call per leap contract.  

Last, selling additional covered calls when your original is way otm and let that original call expire worthless instead of rolling
Yikes I don’t want that action
Will you buy us beer?

Looking at Cathie's trading history, if she switches to a 🐻 and inverse her trades, she would make a killing
But Cathie's the inverse queen. She buys it dumps, she sells it moons. If she were to short she'd get ass blasted on the mother of all pumps
In other words, she is the opposite of a good trader.
Her 5 years is 500% return. Spy 5 years return is 100%
The infra bill limits the EV credits to sedans with a msrp lower than $55k, so I hope it doesn’t pass.
Damn financials with a nice rally into the close today. So proud of myself for staying full delta on my leaps and not pussying out and selling calls against when it was down 1.7-1.8% midday. 

Rates are at major resistance so I expect them (and in turn banks and energy) to at least put up a fight in the immediate future. If we get a pop back to the top of the recent range tho could be a good time to minimize exposure
[Why the heck is COVID breaking out again in China?](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/mainland-china-reports-78-new-covid-19-cases-oct-29-vs-64-day-earlier-2021-10-30/)

"It has already fully vaccinated about 75.8% of its 1.4 billion population, and is giving eligible adults a booster shot."
because their vaccine was made in China
From nearly 0 to a bit higher than 0. Not sure if we can count that as breaking out.
It’s a huge exaggeration. Let the bears try their best to do their kindergarten FUD
Covid deaths and cases going up is actually super bullish for the market but the numbers don't reflect what OP is saying.
AY.4.2
Ahh the good ole Chinese product dilemma. Works great for a few months then falls apart
China I feel would give there people placebos and not tell them.  Just like Japan in WWII handing out sheets to the populace as it would protect them from another Atomic attack.or growing up going to the hallway and curling up in case of Nuclear attack in the 80’s.
Because per the CDC the vaccine reduces symptoms and chances to spread, it doesn't make you immune to the shit
Covid here to stay on this planet. We must hope that is becomes as 'harmless' as the flu. Until then boosters for the in risk people.
Their vaccine originally was only like 56% effective at the beginning (or something like that supposedly) so with Delta/+ it’d basically be negligible. Cats out of the bag now
Because the Chinese vaccine is absolute shit and basically does nothing
The Chinese [everything]. If you have never worked with Chinese firms let me assure you, the vast Majority are absolute shit, have no idea what's actually going on, and will lie and cheat blatantly even if you make it clear you will call them out, if they think there's profit in it
Truck prices are crazy got out the door for 106k Ford 6.7 liter fully loaded, Thankyou Tesla
Gonna hold so many goddamn groceries
Lots of tendies on my way to the bank to
Ah yes, the bags of sweet sweet cash. 

Enjoy the new truck 🛻
So the 100k truck is now a thing?
This isn’t even the highest version they get up to about 150k now brand new
I thought it was crazy when I bought a Honda Passport for 51k. I bought one up from the base model. Vehicle prices are wack
Tell me that’s not absurd
I just sold a 2012 Honda Accord lx with 89k miles for 13.9k
Prices are insane. Congrats on the new vehicle
Pls tell me Pton will be ok
I doubt it'll drop below $50.
Pton to the ground!!!

Hey. I was sick also. For literally three weeks. Haven’t been running for a while either :/ good on you for getting back on it. I will too eventually

IWM futures roaring 🚀
#FUCKING ZILLOW
We’re Fucking Zillow? Whatever some red never stopped me before
Field goals are for cowards
I am looking at the futures.

I see neck, I see back

But I don't see pussy or crack

Please advise
Anyone gonna go long PENN after the earnings + BI story today? Down ~20%, I could truly see it fail long-term but short-term I feel like there's a very high likelihood of a bounce or retail momentum. P/E seems fair, recent acquisition of TheScore too
How is this failing? Trading at 9x EV/Ebidta… that’s pretty cheap for a company with upside potential
Tomorrow:

Looking at long term calls for Activision Blizzard.
Looking at calls for Gamestop when they aren't ridiculously priced.
Looking at buying more $PROG.
Seeing if AMD holds on or if there's a tasty dip.
Checking out more DD on corsair to see how many components they make in house.
Looking at Qualcomm and checking out their fundamentals.
Loooking at Texas Instruments.

Always: 
Looking for value plays/calls on FB and Google going into 2023 as I see them performing better than others when cost of money goes up next year.
Ok Gordon Gekko.
Also: watching that movie for the first time... turned it off 10 mins in because I had work the next day.

Everyone poor on here or what? Besides dfv, 10m accounts are the most I’ve seen and even those are  unicorns. How has nobody chucked even a 5 piece on tsla options and showed us a clean 200. Hugely dissatisfied in the gain porn and instead 10% on 200k pops up
Nobody on her knows what they're doing. There are like 10 other subs where the old wsb crowd hangs out. It's like the great diaspora though because each of those subs only has a few thousand members. Like little portions of ancient Rome hanging on after the barbarian takeover. 

But yes I am poor and would probably sell for a 10% gain.
SPY probably won't go up tomorrow, but VXX will likely shit the bed
I bought puts on both today
What TSLA doin tomorrow
Staying flat to fuk fds

That’s cool but I’m playing gta vi while they send me gapes.
Im so confused. SOFI has been mooning and there is very little chatter......
I’m so pissed I didn’t have the 10k available for leaps when it was around 16ish. I’m salty AF
SOFI is going to quadruple in the next year. Its a perfect WSB stock for us option addicts
Fickle little sofi... shhhh. We are all in it.
probably unpopular opinions I dislike the new macbook pros for getting rid of the touchbar & dislike the return of magsafe

likely popular opinions
The arm cpu is still a joke if they had more confidence in its performance they'd name it M2. Love that the ports are mostly back.

I'm holding on to my intel macbook pro as long as possible, let everyone else beta test apples arm cpu until it's good enough or they throw in the towel & replace the dorito chip inside with a real x86 chip

nonetheless bullish on aapl
This is an essay
Hot take but very uninformed. m1 is LEAGUES ahead of anything intel. If you’re in the industry you’d know that top tier talent does not work at intel anymore. That chip didn’t just happen because 1 year Apple decided to switch up the MacBooks. It was years of hiring the best chip designers and hardware engineers from the old leaders like Qualcomm and intel. Now the best in the industry work at Apple, Nvidia and Tesla.

They’d call it m2 if it was actually a different chip but m1 max and pro is actually the exact same chip just with more cores and more ram. The number of those components is arbitrary and the original m1 could have had that too because the rest of the chip is the exact same
It’s not that the m1 is ahead of any processors it’s that their Linux kernel is extremely well optimized and the memory utilization is managed very well as a result. This is not some breakthrough technology that is going to change anything. Linux memory management has always been ahead of windows.

DKNG
Sell $BB 50% loss and but $PENN
I’m gonna go to bed before I transition from sloppy to pathetic.
SQ is a maybe a good short here because earnings were pretty bad and it's correlated with corn. In addition of course to being an absurdly overvalued shitco although that doesn't really matter anymore

maybe a long dated baby put spread ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Whats the correlation with corn?

Thinking of going all in on OCGN, and buying every dip
Crazy. But hope it works out for you.
He trash
Visualmod, this man called me trash 🥺🥺
Ocgn dumped so fucking hard. I bet that stock holders mostly are homeless punks
Buy that fucking dip. I bought in when rumors first hit last week, and I'm 20% down. It's a volatile stock but there will be at least once more spike. COVAXIN will hit Canadian market soon, and FDA approval is in reach too.
Anybody else nervous for DKNG earnings?
Nope. They could moon 20% and I’d still be 30% OTM on my APR options. Can’t get any more fucked then I already am.
RIP
Are they reporting before or after the bell?
Before
Does any company report after the bell on Friday’s ?
Excited for GENI
yep bought calls at open and bag holding big time lol
do we know what time
PENN up 1.41% since buy-in but I feel gross holding it..
Let it run
I know that makes sense logically but it feels so wrong holding PENN after hearing how Portnoy treated the girls. I'm so conflicted.
I would have felt gross owning it before this. Have you seen his videos? What an arrogant god-complex no talent, rich fuck.
Ugh. I can't do it. Holding it is killing me. I never felt such contempt for myself. I'm going to sell it.
Jensen Huang (NVDA CEO) on their last earnings call: "So I’m pretty certain that at this level Omniverse and the metaverse goes to be a brand new economic system that’s bigger than our present economic system."

This shit is undervalued at anything below $1T, its gonna go hunting for MSFT and AAPL if the stars keep alligning for them the way they have been.
Holy shit guys. This PTON is going to make alot of people alot of money (respectively). I don't have much money so I only have what I could afford to lose (3 puts), but I know a guy who has 50 of the 85p, thats like 20k in 0DTE puts. Anyways, that'll be worth 120k today easy.

Intel calls any good? Intel’s new chips are extremely competitive (beating AMD’s top chips in multiple benchmarks) and they have a roughly 10% gap to fill yet
They are beating AMD’s 2 year old chips by consuming twice the power.
For the price, doesn’t make sense to go AMD though
Beating old chips is to be expected. AMD still got a big lead in the servers, which is the most important thing
Yeah but I don’t really care about AMD, I can’t justify going with them with how there assets totaling 10B yet there market cap is almost that of intel even though intel has 170b in assets, I know the growth argument but damn, I’m not expecting them to grow 100+ % for the next 5 years
AMD has far superior management and products, and they aren't held back by shifty fabs. Intel will never catch up with TSMC. Period. They are a liability.

However, yea Intel is undervalued right now. But that doesn't make AMD overvalued...

Some of you losers are really still holding tsla positions instead of exiting with profit and moving to the next play

Youre either too greedy or see too much "hodl!" In your twitter/discord/whatever
Yes. I’m so dumb for earning more profit today.
Wow, you really showed me, i guess i was wrong to take 300% in half a day and roll it into more profitable plays. Shouldve held for a few more days so theta and opportunity cost could eat my ass
Ha. Noob. I got 301%.
Exit short position aka options. Realizing short term gains on shares is not ideal. Sell now for and realize short term gains or keep for a year for 15%. That's 20% swing.
Oh youre holding shares.... ok then
Its get fucked friday tomorrow. Prep your anus, we spelunking into the red cavern.

Guys FB is trying to pretend like another company with the name Meta doesn't exist.  

The company is actively being harrased to sell FB their name, they are refusing to sell.

Possible put play on FB before it becomes news.
already is news.  no one cares, apparently.
Awh I always late

I just saw it in a random meme and thought big if tru
The company filed a patent in august, doesn’t have it yet but is asking FB for 20m.

20m for a near 1t company is nothing.
Calls on FB then
Well they've already got [Meta.com](https://Meta.com) it seems, so I doubt they really care.

Everyone is working. Explain to me how the flu has anything to do with the clogged ports being caused by artificial demand from printed money
Oh look, I already found a retard.
Again. No one is not working from the flu. Why is it causing an issue? You can only blame the virus for economic woes when the country is shut down retard
The virus isn’t threatening the economy.

The government did all that.
How fucking dense are you?
Vaers and long term potential side effects.  Or you know any FDA approved drug over the past 30 years that has turned into lawsuits because they were found to be unsafe.  Or lawsuits the current vaccine makers have had to pay.  Or how generally if you aren't old are fat it doesn't kill you.  Or how people already have their immune system make immunities from recovering like we've gotten through literally every sickness since the dawn of time that didn't have vaccines.



But ya, fuckfaces :D
I agree. Fda approved drugs never saved any lives. I'm going back into blood letting. If they did it to George Washington, it's good enough for me.
Generally FDA approved drugs are for those that have serious side effects or death.  When something has a 99.7+% survival rate for people who aren't fat or old the concern comes more from the untested long term side effects unless you are fat or old.  

Go look at the numbers, what percent of deaths are from people at the general age of death of all causes(around 73 years old I believe) and how many also had other things wrong with them?

People act like it's covid alone killing people, and not old age and poor health.
Lol wut? Go die in a fucking dumpster.
People like you make me glad Hitler did his shit when he did and not today because there is no way cowards like you afraid of a disease with such a high survival rate would jump out of planes or storm the beaches today.

It was around 11k before covid hit. Made some deposits along the way, probably another 10k all told. Could have played a lot of moments better than I did… but I never blew it up entirely.
Where do we see NVDA tomorrow?

can anyone tell me what happens when a stock drops below my put price? Grabbed $80 PTON Puts and now it’s crashing towards $60 but I have no idea what that does for me

Also, enjoy the money.
They'll be exercised if you don't close them and they expire ITM, so if you don't hold the stock you would wake up to a PTON short from your strike price in your account.
11/12 expiration better to just offload the contracts tomo I imagine?
If it opens to -25% or worse absolutely close them.

Your entry/exit will never ve perfect. If it's a green af trade, book it and on to the next.
🤙🏼😎🚬
Enjoy the profits.
20-(whatever you paid for the puts)=gain 

If they expire tomorrow
what if they expire next Friday 11/12?
Then you get some extra time premium added in there too. This should help:

You literally can’t tell me the crash isn’t coming soon. Every company who has remotely bad earnings/press is dropping by 25%. This means the funds know the crash is coming and is dropping any loose ends the moments something bad pops up while trying to squeeze out the last bit of pump the market has. This market is fucking scary but also exhilarating, i’m so fucking hyped to lose all of my money on options on this roller coasterv

Looking at charts rn and it really looks like we should be consolidating soon. Normally I try to make the smart and rational move, but market is clearly retarded so I am going to buy calls instead of puts.

Just know that I am wrong like 89% of the time so I apologize in advance if I mark the top.
This “I bought calls, sorry guys the top is in” joke is tired
this guy brought stats cut him some slack
It’s not a joke. People here are fucking retarded.

I went outside to get a smoke from my car one time and she pulled up on me with her friend. Then we went to get drinks.
LMAO
You like her boyfriend?
We often question, “what is the meaning of life”

Well, we will never, i mean NEVER know

All we can do is try our best in where we are at,

Work as hard as you can

Be a good family man

Be a good father

Be an honorable member of society

What i am trying to say is

If you can wake up, try your best, and help others, that is life well spent

Edit:  i am very drunk
That's it man. We're not meant to know anything further. Do your best and pass it along.
when is baba announcing results?
😘🍑 when u suck my fat cock.

Stop buying chynah stocks
F gonna break 20 EOD I’m certain
Ban bet it then
it's not, lol
PTON was to obvious. Puts won't print as much as people think. Expect a rebound in the premarket
Nah. This thing ded. Company is gonna get completely murked after iFit IPOs.
def bearish on the outlook. But I doubt it falls much more tomorrow
Mods pls ban u/catgurl. She has a frenchie that is super cute and looks like Remy and there can only be one Remy here
  
Edit: her frenchie Frankie https://m.imgur.com/a/083kydt. I recommend immediate ban
bruh I legit got railed in October and just came back. We were tits up in spy puts, how did it end for you? I got absolutely fucked
> I'm sorry to hear that. I made a lot of money on those puts and then cashed out before the market imploded
Got fucked in 4D. Gave up on puts. All good
I will believe that you are no longer 🌈 when you prove it
I am truly the worst and ban worthy- frankie aka fathead is undeniably adorbs ;)

Do you pay extra for that?

Really considering NVDA FDs tomorrow…anyone else jumping in?
Bought a handful of 11/5 315c one minute from close today
That train is so fat idk if it can be stopped by tomorrow. It’s dumping money on us and what, we’re supposed to run away?

This value stock is due for a re-evaluation
Never mind about the falling star on SPY daily. It was canceled.
Come on fly donkey king, you didn't rape nobody
PTON cut the price of the bike and ran commercials about it.  Talk about a red flag in hindsight.
Hopefully Ford keeps going so I can work on this half chub.
Up goes PINS.
Well at least I have 30days for my abnb calls🤦
Who said pins puts hahaha
Pinterest calls and peloton puts was the play
I knew it! The expectations were so less with PINS that it was bound to 🌙
Yeah man, it’s mooned to where it was at 3pm, amazing!
Fuck yes, got at least 2/3 of my plays right today (PINS and PTON). Let's see about RKT.
Wow PINS up, UBER down
F
Why does the market care about some stupid gossip story about the president of a company that has equity in a larger company
omg shoutout to the guy who posted the Peloton DD the other day. these puts are printing!!
I love these days where there’s downvoting bears going crazy. Let’s me know how many bears died today. Bears deserve nothing but death, poors are gross and rats of course, but bears want to make you in to poors.
Lol chill out guy. I had calls today too but you sound like a psycho
Peloton was so obvious, and I didn’t play it
Nvax up AH
Pton puts $$$
Peloton 🥸🤯
Woah what happened there??
lol pton

jesus fuck
I feel sick
Saw that Uber dip coming from a mile away. Glad I sold calls before close.

Do they have earnings soon?
They just had them.  Earnings were good and they got SMASHED.
Oof.  I like.  May buy if good and cheap
It’s… it’s up 5 cents after hours?
8 cents now.  Don't miss out on the ride back to $15.
Ohhh you are being serious??

Down 30% on NVDA 11/12 310c. Am I fucked?
11/19 310c would be my play with earnings 11/17. They beat again of course
Same boat
Yea
Oh man PTON to the core.  Never did like premium at home workout equipment.

Amazing how the housing market is up 20% and yet Z is still losing money.
That's what taking debt that you can't pay off will do to you
No labor, materials, or capital to fix the hell holes they bought
That's cuz zillows a retard for trying to get into home flipping
nvda all you have to do is lose like 3-5% of your gains tomorrow and i can get out of these 285 puts that i bought which still lost me money
Why buy way OTM when it’s 1dte???
Anyone else find it alarming the fed has bought 20% of all mortgage debt in the WHOLE COUNTRY. how is this free market anymore? Is the feds only purpose to pump asset valuations?

I read something about how only like 10% of US workers are still full time WFH. I think people went to hard into the "new paradigm" meme. Turns out humans are still social creatures.
TBH I’d be happy to work from home full time and have my only human contact be the hour or so I spend at the gym each week night.
Are SAVA and NVDA done moving, or is it still good to get in? I'm not trying to FOMO but I've been in GOOG and TSLA mainly these past two weeks.
SAVA will get shorted to oblivion before the rise to $400 over the next 12+ months. You can find a better entry.  


I say this as a huge SAVA bull with a sub 60 cost average and a nice heap of shares. When it dips again, I'm buying ATM calls for a few months out. Thought about doing it when it was at 45 ish a while back - they were 2.50/contract, checked EOD today and they were going for around 13.50. 

Usually I don't like options on something as volatile as a super speculative biopharma ticker but I have a shit ton of faith in the company.
Bullish but warning me to stay away, i like the balance
I must have misspoken.

Join us, but wait for a better entry because you will probably get one.
Ooh okay, thank you
Did NET beat earnings?
Fortinet?
Cloudflare
I bought I was thinking about buying cloudfare calls this morning but instead went it Fortinet and it payed off
Barely
When you could have profited 2k on your SQ options, but you feel vindicated selling them yesterday plus 450....Profit is profit, and I could have just gotten slaughtered
Playing the run up on hype is a hood move every time.

Anyone here actually subscribe to netflix?


I mean everything is avaiable on hdseries.
I get it for free with my cell service
Yeah, let’s get a subscriber count going…….1% of wallstreetbets uses it, it must be popular
Yeah I’m in a service sharing circle with 8 of my cousins. So I get 8 other services for a netflick.99
I'm subscribed to Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Youtube TV, HBO Max, and Apple TV
Why?
They all have shows I want to watch?

NET is the most overpriced shit out there. 100X NTM Rev. this is a joke.
You watch. This ain’t shit. They are superior in the most important field and ever increasingly
Important and that’s a fact. For billion dollar companies around the world that are essentially dependent on them and their track record
Not even close to some 🤡 stocks in this market
You can say that about any growth tech stock, crazy valuations as long as interest rates stay low and from the looks of it countries arent budging like the bank of england today
PTON’s valuation was pants on head retarded and you all knew it. $50b market cap on 800 million sales and per quarter and docking losses. This was coming
Well, do the same math for tesla, pton actually looks better
ha was just about to say the same thing lol
Yeah, everybody wanted to work out in their bedroom and pay a subscription.
for real we all screamed how it was overvalued af putting an ipad on a bike

market finally catching on
I'm waiting for PTON puts posts. I hope some retards did that.
Missed the buy opportunity on open and then stared at it all day and was scared off by the -3% and increasing premiums. How big of a retard am I?
Not bigger than me. I did same thing and told myself that you're gonna regret it which I'm now
Alright you want a dick measuring contest on who's the biggest retard? 

I sent a message to the 2 groups of guys I talk stocks with and told them I was buying the puts in the morning and then just sat with my cock in hand. I deserve it.
> My cock is bigger than all of theirs combined.
You win. I also have very small and glass balls. Not made out of steel and big. So I got pussy. It was a clear dump but still scared.

Gonna print like crazy.

ITM was high premium premium prob right ?
> The premium is high because of the low volume. The higher the premium, the lower chance you will get your money back if you buy now and sell later.
Thank you. Learned something new today.
PTON should have taken my idea of a bike seat with a buttplug built in - some would never want to get off
> The first documented use of a bicycle seat for sexual pleasure was in 1817, when the French aristocrat Comte de Sade had himself bound to a chair while his mistress used a specially designed saddle on him.
There's no way this is a fucking bot lol

I've got 40k riding on X and NUE calls on the hope that the House can stop tripping over themselves and pass the infrastructure bill tomorrow.
Do you not think that’s priced in??
Probably is. Or enough so that it will only see a few % pop. I am going for the ETF route with SPY, maybe even the DOW specifically for infrastructure bill passing
maybe PTON worth a gamble? if they sign another big celebrity to endorse them, they can get a spike up
> The probability that PTON will be worth a gamble is 0.00000000%.
Never tell me the odds

And nobody played NKLA, was the perfect nonsense move
Why did PENN crash ?
Allegedly, Dave Portnoy chokes and rapes women, and they own a big share in his property.
Bad earnings in the AM I think

Whats the deal with SAVA? Is it a short squeeze?
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Long story short: a very bearish citizen's petition was filed over the summer alleging fraud with SAVA's clinical trial results. This and other short attacks tanked the stock for months.  Today, the main Neuroscience journal said they independently verified the results and there's no evidence of fraud.  Alzheimer's treatment/cure is holy grail for pharmaceutical at the moment.  SAVA has an oral drug that is safe and showing cognitive improvement in study patients.  Pretty unheard of in the field.  So this mixed with the amount of shorting that's been going on lead to today's action, and if it continues, there's high probability of a short/gamma squeeze.  Stock is also very low float, so it moves a ton.
there were BS allegations that their data reports were manipulated in Aug....the stock tanked...and their have been lawyers placing ads on yahoo finance since then to CALL THEM IF U LOST MONEY.....

It was proven false today......it was probably heavily shorted.....greedy scum don't want a cure for alzheimer's disease.
DKNG shitting the bed before earnings... How?!

I’m extremely smooth brained. Can someone explain the fuckery around when BABA has their earnings release? I don’t understand.
They busy making record sales with singles day/week. You’ll hear a date soon
I’ve heard the 3rd, 4th, and 11th. So thought I’d ask
It’s the 10th
AMZN you suck! Last two earnings, you sold off post-earnings and had me in the red for at least a week or two. This time, I sell before earnings anticipating a drop so I can get back in at a lower price, and you run away!

Will you help?
Square barely missed expectations but most of it was due to expanding growth expenditure. User base and transactions increased for their cash app and they have plans to integrate more of their other commerce platforms together. 

Lots of calls for Nov 21st 4 days after the release of their white paper on customer mining and hard wallet plans. 

Could see panic sell in the morning but long term square is being lead in the right direction. Earnings also only accounted for their coin value up to sep 29th when the coin was 40k.
do you see SQ at $500 by 2024?

Lol my 43% return in less than a week would disagree
You think Pton will pop tomorrow morning
no, it's dead. I only hope PINS die tomorrow morning
We are you guys so sure DKNG will shit tomorrow 👀
Their numbers have been absolutely awful, they lose more money every quarter than they do in revenue, Q3 is easily the weakest quarter for sports gambling, and they're already vastly overvalued. It's an absolute lock to have a bad earnings report. Now maybe enough people can drive it back to $50 at some point but it's more than likely going to melt far below $40 in the next few weeks.
On the other hand, nba announced them as an official partner today and New York is expected to list them as an official provider in their state this week. So I wouldn’t call a drop after earnings an absolute lock, but maybe that’s just the hopium tslking
Fuck! I’ll do some more DD next time. All of the people I know use that shit, I thought that maybe it was doing good.

Who’s losing all their money tomorrow?… NOSES
I would be perfectly content with $30k/yr, but I can’t work. I can’t take any money with me to the afterlife. I’m just going thru the motions
We don’t know that for certain. Maybe we simply haven’t tried hard enough?
Can’t or won’t?
Can’t. Imagine the government gave me $30k, but I can’t work or I’ll lose the benefits
You could make 30k a year easy theta ganging if you’re cool with close strike and potential call always with like 100k
I mean more like a $30k direct deposit on Jan 1, and i literally can’t grow it. Like I’m just not allowed to lol
Ah ok. Sue a company.

Do you guys think  buying puts on Zoom will be the same with Zillow and PTON ?

I still don't understand $LCID price right now. Chegg to $30, Penn to $55, Zillow to $65, Peleton to $60 yet $LCID is almost $40? Same market cap as Ford? Their earnings on Monday the 15th will be the worst earnings out of any company that has yet to be reported.
We are in an EV bubble currently.
Because they’re an EV and Tesla is going insane right now
I am long on LCID but def loading puts
They are currently delivering on vehicles that cost $170K a piece.  They have ambitious plans for next year and are rapidly expanding manufacturing capacity.  Their battery tech is top of the line, and they may get a lucrative contract with the Saudi PIF for that battery tech.  Also the Tesla effect.
still not worth 60 Billion lmao. And TSLA is overpriced too.
Future, investors invest in the future of a company, at least with growth stock like $LCID. Yes they will be red in the ec. Investors are well aware of that. But unless those first 500 cars start exploding, $LCID has a lot of potential.
Ya AMZN was the future of the internet, and it went from $0 to $200, but they priced 10 years in and it fell back to $6 before going over $200 again. $LCID will be under $15 next year

16 is on the lower end.  Our summer mfg interns were 19/hr.  Co-Op is 23.
Thanks for the insight :)
If it’s any consolation, I’ve got peers offering 75k for recent college grads in the Midwest
That’s pretty good. I’ve heard most people get 60-65k for a first job. Hopefully I’m able to grab something that pays a lil more
Yesh

Go with the job that you think will teach you the most
Don’t do that. Get the knowledge and you will be well paid once you have the almighty piece of paper.

Good luck
Bro I legit have to work or I’m homeless and starving
Then you get a job or work a gig at night. Internships are not jobs and should not be treated that way.

It’s brutal, I get it.

No cuz there is 1 billion shares out there

They can go up to 27,000%

Off topic, but are hipsters hard to find? Genuinely curious. I don't mean typical Oreganer.

You can't be a real hipster if you're a tryhard.
Lmao who wants to be ahipster anyways. "Yea let me get a peperoni pizza with a whole oregano leaf and an ok beer served on a dirty brick, oh $45 no problem"
That's what a tryhard is. I get it, it's because they don't make themselves known... so like real hipsters are like not-vegans? They don't have to let people know?

Do you guys think it could be the right time. to sell AMC or wait for the earnings report on Monday? I just want to get rid of this stock and invest in something else
Hey, my name is {some random idiot on the internet} and I still haven't figured out that Tesla will be making $10k operational earnings per EV sold and they're going be selling millions and millions each year alongside of solar power plants purchasing their battery storage at huge margins. Therefore, I think it's overvalued without having any valuation model myself. I'm so salty.
If they only make $10K per car on operations they're screwed. Every other automaker does better than that. Solar power is crowded and getting more crowded.
>Every other automaker does better than that

Lol no they don't. They actually make negative gross margin on each car they sell haha.. funny I mention idiots and they come out of the woodwork
Bro, you have no idea how much money they would have to make to justify their bullshit stock price
Lol, no that's you dude
Feel like TSLA puts could have been the play for tomorrow 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Never short TSLA.
Got a feeling we sell off tomorrow.

There is no semiconductor stock that I would feel more comfortable putting money in right now than TSM
TSM is the GOAT and always will be. Easily going to a 2-3 trillion marketcap by 2030 with the new foundries coming and the price increases
I bought calls ending next week. 120c & 125c
Am i chillin or what
Honestly short dated options are tricky with TSM I only do them for earnings when I know nothing is priced in. I use leaps for TSM because it’s a low volatility stock then I exercise almost always at expiration
PENN is a buy. 🚀
Looks tasty
SQ is so overpriced lol
But they have so many commercials!
I just want to address the elephant in my room, I lost 30% of my proud earnings on bbby ah don't fall into this bull shit trap let it die down we can bring the price up after the shorts make 0 from no one buying if you got positions just sell that's how you fuck shorts sell don't buy lol I'm hella sad I bought out of fomo
Watch $SAVA tomorrow and Monday. 🚀 ⛽ Is in. Shorts are running scared. Check the SI and borrowing rates. 🦍 with big 🍆 will make some 💵 here!!!
this really looks like an AI wrote it
Not just that.

1. Vindicated today that they are not Theranos. No data manipulation.
2. ER on the 8th and CTAD on the 9th. If they announce any promising news on their alzheimers drug at the CTAD, it's back to $120-140 level

That accusation on data manipulation was fishy to begin with. Lawsuit filed by a law firm representing by anonymous short sellers. If that's not some shady shit, I dont know what is
$NET nearly $210 AH lmfao. Doesn’t surprise me at all

How do make this bet current?
Anyone playing bidu for the earnings run up?
Nope. Got out of my position for obvious reasons. Wish you luck though
If piece of shit lending club, affirm, and upstart can all be valued like TSLA so can fucking SOFI. So undervalued.
Is affirm different than sofi. If so how
Ask VisualMod
Nice premiums though. Been selling CCs for weeks. For some reason, it has a consistently high IV for a $160 stock.
SOFI does not specialize in the same product as LC and UPST. They have tons of student loans and mortgages. Not all consumer. Not a great comparison. 

Not shitting on SOFI just saying it’s not 1-to-1 although we can all agree UPST multiple is stupid high
I grouped them 3 together bc they’re all fintech and they trade higher than SOFI even tho SOFI has much more to offer
I’m super long LC but the recent Runup makes me less excited about the next 6 months as I was the past 6 months. I need to do more homework on SOFI cause once they close bank charter they will become more profitable.

I have friends, who bought a second Frenchie b/c they thought their first Frenchie can use a brother to play with and that did not go well with the first Frenchie. Also the second one is crazy unlike the first one
Same happened with my Great Pyrenees, his new bitch is crazy
Yeah I considered that. Remy is super sensitive/timid. Plus what happens is now u just have two dogs waiting for ur attention

What was the deal with Chapelle’s special and NFLX walkouts? It’s not any more offensive than his typical material and in my opinion was actually pretty heartening. (Admittedly as a white heterosexual dude my opinion is probably total shit on most subjects with any cultural, social, or political nuance).
Don’t let your “identity” determine whether your opinions matter or not. White straight males have the ability to critically think about things the same way anyone else of another color or sex does.
I think this this is a trick. No it *doesn’t*??
I’m not trying to trick you. You felt the need to add in your physical characteristics and sexual preferences in parentheses, giving off the impression that your opinion is less valuable because of those things. I simply stated it wasn’t. Don’t be scared to state an opinion on something, especially if you believe logic and reason backs it, just because you look a certain way.
You might be right. For sure in 2015. Not sure anymore I’m 2021.
I understand. We’ve shifted further away as a society from valuing diversity of thought and ideas to focusing in on how someone physically looks to determine whether what they say has merit or not. Either way, this isn’t the sub to discuss this, Godspeed to ya my friend, good luck at market open tomorrow!

Why was this downvoted?? Jerks.
I know right. So I invited him to a Friendsgiving that he said he heard about and might go to. He ended up coming but barely talked to me. This was like 45 minutes away from his house too wtf
I mean if he's an introvert and doesn't feel comfortable with the people he's around yet then maybe he was being shy? Did you feel like he was ignoring you or that he was just being reserved in general?

Guys normally wouldn't visit someone 45 mins away from where they live unless they have some good feeling towards the other person, right?
Def not shy, he knew people there and was talking to them- sounded very out going actually. He wasn’t really ignoring me either but def didn’t put any effort into talking to me
Was he your +1? Maybe he thought it was just another party? I would be a bit disappointed if I liked someone and invited them to a place and they didn't spend much time with me. But some guys are just really slow when it comes to showing romantic interest.
Or he’s horny and want to FuK. 🤷‍♂️
He wasn't even being attentive to her when he got there tho.
Smart guy. His plan worked
Meaning??
By ignoring you, you're obsessing over him.
So he thinks I like him?
Do you?  If you don't, why worry about it.  If you do, he does or else he wouldn't have come.  My suggestion... be more direct.  A lot of guys have no concept of how to initiate or even have a conversation with a woman without either pissing themselves  or getting an awkward fear boner.
I doubt he came just for me he said he knew about it when I mentioned it
So you do like him then. Direct approach it is. Shoot your shot.
Or you’re just fun to tease
😔
> I'm not obsessing. I don't give a shit about him.
you weren't clear enough about which yams you wanted to offer him, be straightforward if he's an autist
> The yams are for my wife who is also autistic. I am not an autist, but have a very high IQ and some of the symptoms of autism.
So you invited him but he was already invited?
Ya he said he heard about it
That’s a lot awkward.  If you want to hang out with him ask him one on one, that way you know his intentions and he knows yours.
Honestly, if you’re bored and want to see your friends or hang out. 45 minutes isn’t that far to travel unless maybe in the winter. Some people just love the ride too.

My nvda 345c 11/5 have more of a chance of hitting than gme hitting 300

Edit: thanks for the reward but i find it hard to believe a wicked stoner like me is helpful.

This fucking cult better not use this as a rally cry for 300 just to piss me off.

Fucking zoomers
how about you stop going in shit tickers
So is NVDA crashing tomorrow too?
I imagine it’ll be a violent open
Why would it?
COIN closed +0,02% today, big gains🚀 earnings on tuesday, pre run up tomorrow
$Penn rebound To the moon, davy bought the dip so I will too! I need a good fat loss to humble me
I can’t wait till spy 460 tomorrow.
Got some puts as well. Feeling pretty nervous though ngl
You should. It's a bear trap. I got calls on spy. 465c 11/15.
You’re ded but don’t know it yet
Full cash cause I ain't 🌈. Looking forward to the juicy dip after y'all print
 🐻s are 🌈
Imagine the WSB metaverse. We can actually fuck bears there instead of talking about it. During midnight their avatars will all be dancing bears and we can just come in and gang raype them at 9am when we buy up the dip and fuck their puts for the 200th day in a row.
sitting here realizing that Ford can't keep rising. today has to be the rug pull, I can smell it in my penis and ass. I'll get puts at open, I think

Bother!
I definitely jumped in spy puts too early today @ $466.50. Smart play is to wait for gap up to 470 tomorrow, and start buying around 472 (I got fiboretrace at 472.50). Set stop loss at 475, good luck/night nerds <3
So another China company halted over debt concerns?? Uh oh

Man I 🙏 sq can pull a 🚀 moon mission tomorrow (like nvda did today) if not I only lose maybe $800)…
I really just wanna know if spy calls are safe at open
Your fear speaks volumes to what the right answer is
don’t listen to these fukin bers— SPY calls are always safe as long as you pick the right exp 🔮

Herman cain award is an interesting study in humanity. Don’t know how to feel, but I’m pro jab
You are missing the point. And people often find irony funny
it’s funny when people say no to a vaccine for no reason for a disease that kills them
You have to admit the irony of antivaxxers that didn’t trust the doctors with the vaccine, running to a hospital as soon as they get sick.

If spy is 440 in your dreams you better wake up and apologize.
Not until next year

JPOW was waiting until rearfirmation to taper hard lol. Just watch
True
theres no way SPY can keep going up from here, right ?
Probably up tomorrow until mid day. Technicals and VXX are screaming for a pullback
Doubt it and you’ll lose money.

Doggo predictions - let's see what happens tomorrow at open
Coinbase is the move honestly, they are going to blow past their Q3 EPS and earnings by at least 1.5x consensus estimate
Indeed,.people are sleeping on it. Institutions think it's cash flows are a fluke
I have one 350c for Jan 2023, cost like 65.00, but it could still be a massive return if 🌽 stays volatile

PTON getting crushed…
Z mooning tomorrow
Z. PTON. PENN.

All drop 20%-25% in a day within a week of each other. 

Canary in the coal mine of the bubble pop?
nah. February was worse, all the trash came back, had another crash in May, all the trash came back. The bubble doesn't really pop, capital just rotates between different flavors of trash forever
Well. I picked up some PENN calls today. 11/26 $65c for 1.73
Don't forget Chegg, anything that got that covid boost
Covid stocks, yo. Should have popped during the summer, we're just getting confirmation now.
Don’t think PENN is a Covid stock. As in, not like a recovery is bad news for PENN like it is for PTON
AMC announcing profits next Tuesday , getting in now and holding! Looking good 👍🏻
Earnings call is Monday after market.
AH doesn’t mean much to me
It should on strong volume.

I deserve these downvotes then. My b

God my Pton sharws need a blessing pls
really low volume on RKT in post market, this is just WSB panic selling, I'll wait to see what the big boys do tomorrow morning

Uber once again not profitable
They really need to gouge drunks at bar time more and they’d be profitable.
PTON CALLS!
At this rate, they're gonna have to rebrand from Peloton to Pelopound(ed).
Spy puts tomorrow if they moon at open
No chance
Is the ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5958) emoji suppose to mean "f@g"??

Any other Chads here YOLOing on some $CHGG leaps tomorrow?

Kinda hope COIN Implodes before the 🌽 run so I can load some calls
Why are you expecting corn to run?
🌽 will be 100k
I don't know. Cathie said corn will be 200-300k but with her track record lately, it'll probably drop to 20-30k.
I will buy a whole goddamn field if that happens
November is brrrrr for 🌽 if you will 

Any day now. I’m loaded with HUT and MARA calls right now, wouldn’t mind adding coin on a discount 

Hope it works out
Not OP but i think it’ll sink back to 45 maybe before launching again in May
in May? Damn, that's like forever from now
I know but The coin has its own wills. But it’s been holding at 60 for too long. Makes me feel like a drop is coming. For stocks maybe opposite but the coin is odd
It has big leaps followed by periods of decline and consolidation. Hovering around 60k for a couple weeks doesn't mean it's gonna drop.
I don’t feel confident it holds at 60
Great, invest on vague feelings and see how that works out
always thought COIN just follows beetcoin
You guys helped my find some good whiskey to spend my SPY earnings on now how about some good cigars?
Fuente fuente opus x lost city
Taaka
I guess that works too
Just buy more spy calls.
Don’t worry I am
If it stays on this track and you bought the calls for the 29th  at open, you could buy like 30 call contracts for like 496 and turn 300 dollars into 20k given that it keeps going up.
I am holding 12/10 and 12/31 500 calls hoping for ITM by December. Will be buying more at open
This man is destined for yachts and lambos.
yes Indeed

What whiskey did you go with
Ordering a few blends of Woodford Reserve, along with buffalo trace. Making a list of need to try whiskeys, had some good suggestions.
Willet potstill very good highly recommend if you can get it
I will add it to the list thanks
> I don’t think so.
I accidentally called the cops trying to change the volume on my phone. I feel so bad.
why cause they had to stop harassing a mentally unstable homeless person for 5 minutes to answer your call?
It’s easily done - that’s how I called an air strike on my neighbours house ( may they rest in peace )
When this bull market ends, we'll enter a bear market that will take several years. It will be extremely brutal. Bull will be fuk.
You must be DEEP in hibernation if you're having these types of dreams
nah, errybody gonna buy puts like they buy calls now and market makers will push the prices up to eat options premium.
Honestly it will prolly be a yearish but will be a decent dip. Like a worse version of what happened to China
Bull mark will never even.  We just buy more and more.....
Meh. As long as it's not like the 69s and 70s. According to some random YouTube guy apparently the whole market traded sideways for like 15 years and everyone was fucked.
Well technically Nasdaq traded sideways between 2000 and 2014.
BMAQW that's all I'm allowed to say
how do I yolo 10k tomorrow?
0DTE PTON puts
I was thinking either FB 11/19 350c or the degenerate special of 11/5 340c
I only know trading FDs
FDs?
NVDA cuz it's the next trillion company maybe
By some NEGG…stocks with low floats are always fun to ride
PLTR for earnings next week
PYPL 🚀
Give it to me so I can break even for a day
Probably a dumb question but I don't get weekly options. There are currently weekly options that expire on Dec 23 2021, but then it's not a weekly option? I don't get it.
just buy them and sell them when they’re green.
It will be on the 16th
Options have monthly expiration the 3rd week of the month. Every other week is considered “weekly”.
Go back to Robinhood.  You won't have to ask questions there.

PTON is undervalued
Jazz hands

Pray to whatever the fuck God that my GME calls don't fist me in the ass
Just give them to me bro
Pton gonna rebound to 70 watch it
Sorry about those bags.. win some lose some
Avoid PTON, they pretty much announced that their business is dead. If you're looking for a recovery play, Penn is a consistently profitable company that only made 50 cents a share instead of 80 because of Delta variant. Guidance is fine. 

The portnoy story doesn't matter
Sir I only trade meme stocks This is a memsino
Like it or not, peloton is still one of the most innovative companies in the fitness space. This earnings report was pretty disastrous, but that doesn't mean that the company is dead in the water
This PTON drop is way to excessive. I see a quick bounce. The company didn’t exactly declare bankruptcy. Shiet!
That shit should have been drilling for a couple months now it’s been nothing but negative news I see it going to the 40s
yo they were way overvalued to begin with and now their growth just cratered

why would it bounce

so many stuck longs and no one wants to touch it

the only bounce u get is from shorts closing to book profit. i already netted out some of my puts by buying shares afterhours
There were so many long bags I was like damn all these investors can’t be wrong, right???
Everything is way overvalued. You don’t think Tesla is Overvalued or you mean to tell me $1200 for the stock price is about right.
as long as company keeps growing the music will keep playing

PTON missed rly bad and now that their biggest tailwind COVID is done like lmfao they are completely fukt
PTON missed less than 1% on their revenue estimates.
yah but they had to revise annual guidance way downies

look price is truth...
Bro PTON is an exercise equipment company, you have to be brain dead to think it should have a market cap of 26bil
PTON is generating 4-5B in revenue each year. Most companies have a 10x market cap on their annual revenue figures. PTON market cap should actually be higher.
Many of you downvoted my earlier comment about skeletons having penis bones which I take as obvious evidence of the medical coverup on this topic. I dare anyone to try and downvote actual hard proof, though. This picture may shock you

Calls on PENN 

Portnoy is innocent until proven guilty. Go to the police get him charged file a civil suit orrrr talk to Business Insider. 🅱️etarded.
Portnoy is a piece of shit grifter but I feel bad for him honestly
If a story about girls literally harassing him for attention and sex, then getting it, followed by them regretting it enrages you, you need to take a long look in the mirror and stop reading the NYT
Idk if u agree with me or not lol
Basically yes lol, he is mostly a douche but has done some good for small business and really him consensually fucking young adults should not be a story but here we are with our retarded media

Tesla’s fair value is like 40bn max that’s probably generous as well
Why do people parrot this all the time? Who gives a fuck? Years later and the epic return to “fair value” is still just a ber masturbation fantasy.
Why do people give a fuck maybe because they’re more valuable than the next 9 car makers combined for some stupid reason Toyota sell 20x more cars than Tesla every year and have been the market leader for the last 40 years and still somehow Tesla is worth 5x more that’s why people care because it’s fucking retarded
Correct but don’t waste your money trying to short it. At least not now. Once this bull market ends there will be massive tenders to be made on the way down tho.
While true.  This seems not to matter

Your puts burned so stfu🤡
believe me im more content knowing i made the smart play versus being the complete moron buying calls on this overvalued dumpster LOL
Overvalued dumpster? You define it? Soo smart you are and you dont even know what this company does, do you?
Bro they power the most important aspects of a huge part of the internet in a day and age where security couldn’t be more
Important for these billion dollar+ companies and it will never not be an issue

So
Many salty bears lmfao
They dont do much more than Akamai which makes like $3B a year and only a $17B market cap. FSLY is similar and only $5B.  You don’t think Microsoft or Google could eat these guys in a second if they wanted to?
Thank you pton puts for paying for my omakse
I hope it stays down until market open for you. It will, because that company shouldn’t be public
Imagine making expensive exercise bikes and having that as your growth platform
Any sofi news?
LULU is next I guarantee it
Fuckkkkk don’t tell options&tren it will break his heart :( real shit though I’d rather be in lulu than peloton. Lulu could pull a Nike if they keep growing in popularity
Thoughts on LCID and ZILLOW ?📊📈📉🚀
Z belongs in the 30 range
😂😂
What’s funny?
Maybe 40s but they are under investigation and sold 7k house at a loss cause they are fucken retarded and had lay off 25% of their work force and probably more in the future
Lcid will perform well in the long term, but it's gonna be a tough ride getting there.
LCID GOOD
ZILLOW 👿
Bought both today. Both good long term. The IV is settling down for Lcid, which tomorrow or next week will be a good entry point for calls again.
Does NNN apply to just you or also to our Wendy's customers?

How is NET going even higher wtf
Buying 0dte 215 NET Calls in the morning. Good earnings, ATH breakout, hot sector.
How is a pandemic winding down bad for gambling stocks. Once you’re addicted, you’re addicted for life. We can only hope they got enough users while the getting was good.
I wanted to call the top on Tesla but even the December monthlies are ridiculously expensive. Something like 1300C 12/17 as the top end of a call spread costs $8300 to leg into. And if you somehow manage to get in at a decent price it's priced as if 1300 only has a 30% chance of happening.

Only thing gayer than TSLA is the people making the market on it
when we get “inspired” by something, it’s not because we choose to be inspired, but because the inspiration is so strong and needs an outlet that we become

Lol i didnt look at the volume. Thought it was glitched out because its the only net call with no volume.
0 volume, you won't be able to buy them, maybe try putting an order in at 1.00

Welcome to the bidet brotherhood. 

I can’t shit any other way without feeling like a fucking animal.
Wtf it has a nightlight on if and a heated seat! You have to now.
Just take cheapest one its like 30—40 bucks. U just need water sprinkle ur ass, nothing else pretty much.
Who the fuck is actually going to buy the dip on PTON? There's some dips worth buying and some companies that are hurtling to their death at 500 mph.
just watched a video on stock options explained and I'm still clueless on how they work but fuck it PTON calls it is
Just buy a call if you think it’s gonna go up and a put if you think it’s gonna go down. Farther out date = less risk, farther out strike = more risk but cheaper premiums. Enjoy
Enjoy…..or despair
Terrible advice. Like IV crush doesn’t exist??

Wondering if there are any plays for UWMC earnings on Monday. 

Earnings are premarket Monday.
It will beat earnings expectations big time, go up 0.1% to dump later in the day.

Help.  MP has given me an erection lasting more than 4 hours.
Ok I get it i’m a simp.

So what exactly i should say to my lesbian friend that i want to date her.
Down for threesome
Tell her you'll identify as a bitch if she'll go butt to butt with you on a 2 foot dildo like in the ending of Requiem for Dream
That you’re transitioning in order to have a chance with her
You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take -Warren Buffett
\-alex trebek.
When she says she’s a lesbian say girl me too
Dude accept that she's a lesbian.

She's literally not attracted to your whole gender like that.
easy, tell her youve always been a woman.
Tell her you're really a woman.
Just ask if she’d be willing to try. If she says no, don’t push it.

Bought Zillow and Skillz on CFD. Lets see what happens 🤔
ah, man, fuck PLTR. I forgot I was feeling bold and sold 25.50 FDs on Monday, it never goes up when I actually want it to
PLTR took 30k from me the only 3 stupid days it goes retarded 29+$ and my options expired completely worthless, just to go down 69% a couple of days after. I’m not going to make a wash sale for that garbage
absolute dog shit stock, but I bought into the hype here and I have to keep around at least 100 shares at all times because some small retarded part of me is convinced it'll reach $50 a share someday because some guy said so 2 years ago in a daily thread here
Lol. PLTR shinanigans got me playing just futures for the past month. It’s ok, we will get it back.
DONKEY KONG LFG

Any one here trading from Europe and bought put warrants on peloton but is unable to sell this morning with Franfurt open?
english please
how can you seel your puts from frankfurt when it trades in the US, that makes no logical sense.... just because you are in a different country doesnt mean you get to front run the market it trades on....
I am actually front running the post market session movement as in I would typically be able to sell before the pre-market session starts as frankfort exchange opens 5 hours and a half before US
You can trade pre market if it's CFD

If I end up holding NVDA bags, pretty sure GME will make up for it.  Has every morning this week.
Don't lie to me
There are 10 or so stocks that hold the market up. If it wasn't for those stocks, we'd have been in a bear market already. Small caps and mid caps are flat to down in 2021 while mega caps are up 30%.
That’s what happens when you are a multi trillion dollar corporation that can just bully anyone into submission. I mean look at the Apple v Epic lawsuit — Epic certainly isn’t some shining beacon of kindness,  but they absolutely should have won that case.

#how can I make sure my balls smell good/decent if they currently smell like salted warm fungus? 

Tried body wash and baby powder already. Wait 6 hours and the smell comes back after you open your boxers for a whiff

Positions: DDD, CAKE, ZNGA
see a doctor, that does not sound right.
See doctor for STD test
Puts on your sex life
Bacteria in boxers. Get new ones or wash with vinegar. Try getting an anti fungal ketozol wash/shampoo if you think you actually have something going on down there.
It’s definitely not the boxers they’re clean cuz i washed em. Is it possible my balls? Ive gone days without showering back then but ive been showering everyday for the past 3 years
normal detergent might not be killing the bacteria tho
Tea tree oil.
On the balls after or during the shower
During shower. They make body wash. Expensive though.
Scrub your balls with a loofa and body wash daily, shave your ball hairs, and use a scented powder made for this stuff like Balla. That powder smells heavenly on my testis
Is it good if the girls want to lick the balls though?
I think that’s a good situation, yes. What are you asking here?
Well i dont thinj girls will want to lick up powder
Bro I don’t think girls want to lick your smelly nuts anyways, so what’s the better alternative here? Plus it’s just like baby powder. It gets worked in through the day. There isn’t just dry powder on your nuts all day lmao
Are you fat? I think that’s just the way fat people smell

Tough love here for some folks, but some of you really bought a fucking terrible exercise equipment company that just burns money for insane valuations when there were plenty of other things to buy, maybe like the most profitable company and high growth stock that will ever exist (alibaba) and it’s trading for value p/e? Have Americans really become this stupid? I’m actually terrified tbh, time for some of y’all to start reading a god damn book. It’s not the hEdGieS that took your money, it’s you.

No, trading that news is literally straight speculation… if u heard of it then consider it priced in, we know how over-inflated prices are because of how much money we printed. When stocks go down in earnings even when they beat revenues shows how stocks are priced in.
I'll believe whoever doesn't have the blown up account.

Speculation runs the market tho.
May the best trade win
Stocks do that all the time after earnings.  Nothing new

Why didn’t SOFI dump harder on the warrants redemption? -2.5% won’t help my puts much
Rivian IPO on SOFI is going to bring so many new users. They pulled a power move by enabling that while Robinhood could not

Fuck off Nvidia
I’m saying this in the least offensive way I can, but you all deserve to lose money. Whoever hasn’t been buying spy calls for the past month leading into the new year your IQ is below 75 and I’m happy the transfer of wealth is occurring
Translation: I made one good play on SPY calls and the euphoria faded to anger at all my other mistakes.

Prediction: OP replies and says he is actually up all time and I’m wrong. Will be a lie.
I’ve been up on spy calls for 9 months and the portfolio keeps doubling :)
Told ya
We dipping tomorrow
They saved my port the last 2 weeks. Was down 32% on the year, now down 1.7%, not counting current positions that are up.
Why would you say something so controversial, and yet so brave?  🧐

Go back to Texus dumass
How did they get to you
Ok, serious advice needed.

I (23M) have a friend (22F), who is a lesbian.  Soon after I found out, I told her I have feelings for her and she took it well and we remained friends.  In fact our friendship become deeper afterward.

Since, we grab dinner together atleast twice a week and have spent every single weekend together.  In fact, we have plans to go to Europe next spring, just two of us.

I don’t know how to define our relationship.  We hold hands when going out but have never done anything together.  I love her, and I would be willing to date her for the long haul but I don’t want to bring up the topic in case it ruins what we have right now.

It would be one thing if we were just friends, but it’s like in a weird phase where we depend on each other on daily basis and spend most of the week together.  It’s not a normal friendship, like we’ve done all the dating activities like couple pictures at amusement parks, short vacation, etc.

What should I do?
Ever heard of the “friend zone”? I believe that’s your situation
Let her PEG your bussy
Take a shit on her chest. Establish dominance.
This is the simpest post I have ever read here.
You took simping to a whole new level lol
Use your words with her and tell her what you told us. Maybe lead with “I’m confused about what’s up with us, specifically if there is an “us” to be confused about?”

I think you’re in for a disappointing outcome; if she’s gay, she’s gay dude.
Roll with it and don’t fuck up a great friendship as you may never have one like it again. Sex often dominates relationships and takes attention off the other aspects. This is unique and beautiful.
Grow a pair of nuts. Do you pay when you go out to eat?  Make your move and see if she reciprocates. If not then move on, you can remain friends but stop playing platonic boyfriend.
Why do you need to put a label to it? Are you both getting what you want out of it? Would you feel more comfortable if you just referred to eachother as best friends instead of boyfriend/girlfriend?
> I'm not sure why you're asking me that.
Distance yourself from her and get a different girlfriend. She’ll either come for you or she won’t, but you shouldn’t let yourself be stuck in the holding pattern.
Buy $FRIENDZONE calls and $RELATIONSHIP puts, then tell her how you feel
Try to kiss her. Most lesbians are bi. Make a move! She’s probably just bi-curious
Accept that she's a lesian?
Do you enjoy wasting your time? Do you enjoy wasting your money? Your life?
r/friendzonecucks
Also this is WSB not r/relationship_advice
seems like she doesn’t know what she wants or is under the impression that you two are just friends. you seem to be a little too dependent on her. my advice: tell her again, if she says no then that’s that. or just keep up the friendship if you’re happy with it. maybe ask yourself what exactly you want right now.
Been in a similar situation, she was straight though. We spent a lot of time together. We kissed one night and it made everything super awkward after that. I really wanted to date her, but she didn’t feel the same. We kind of just grew apart. Although, I do still hear from her from time to time. 

Can’t tell you how you should go about it. But if you feel like you can’t keep being her friend without taking another shot, go for it. If you value your friendship and can live with not dating her, try getting over the romantic feelings (I wish I had done that).

How about hating on the government of West/Mainland Taiwan?
> The government of West/Mainland Taiwan is a political entity that controls the island of Taiwan. It was established in 1949 as a successor to the Government of China, which controlled all territory on mainland China and surrounding islands until its defeat by Japan during World War II. The Republic's first president Chiang Kai-shek declared martial law shortly after his arrival, but under international pressure from the United States began moving towards democracy in 1950 with elections for National Assembly being held two years later. Following uprisings around Communist Party rule that resulted in mass executions and civil war between Kuomintang (KMT) forces led by Chiang Kai-shek against Communists who were fighting to establish their own party state across Mainland China; resulting eventually into an armistice agreement signed between KMT & CPC representatives at end May 1949 effectively ending Chinese Civil War once it had been fought out within Mainland territories over previous three decades since 1927 when communists launched their first major uprising known as Nanchang Uprising against ruling KMT regime which failed miserably leading many key leaders executed or fleeing abroad including Mao Zedong himself only returning following Japanese surrender ending WWII where he immediately set about reorganising communist movement based initially on rural soviets throughout North Eastern provinces
Not an expert but I saw a movie (Formosa Betrayed) about Taiwan's nationalist Chinese who took over the island, banned the native language then mass executed the intellectuals and leaders in one brutal evening and wouldn't allow anyone to talk about it for 20 years.
How about we don’t hate on each other and get the fuck off this ticking time bomb of a planet. US and China either get along and compete the right way or we never leave here and we all die. China instigated nothing they did what was bullish for their economy, america has been acting like a bunch of insecure little bitches.
Hey man, it is my right as an American to hate on any government that sucks, including my own.
nah your brains are different lmao

its the root of your collectivism, same behavior as insects
Everyone brains are different. So should I be racist then against people in the US for having an average IQ of 90 when chinas is 110? Everyone is different, variety is what breeds success
IQ is pretty meaningless and you know it
It’s not meaningless at all, it’s the best indicator of cognitive potential

After what jpow said yesterday you won’t catch me buying a put until I truly feel the market is ready to start pricing in rate hikes. I can tell you it’s not happening before June 2022, this shit will legit keep going up and bubble due to the dovish policies. I almost believe we won’t even see the first 0.25-0.5% rate hike until 2023 now. We will only go up to normal rates it’s not going to be that bad as long as spy doesn’t go too high in p/e
Cause the P/E isn't high enough rn
I know NVDA is overbought, but I feel like it’s just gonna keep going. I don’t know why but if earnings is blow out even if it’s 350 the day of earnings. It’s going up to 450 or something mental like that. It just has diamond cock energy at the moment.
Hard to say man it could just as easily run back down to 260

A Peloton is literally the most expensive way to ride indoors, and after the lockdown boost everyone who mightve wanted one either bought in 2020 or decided against it. I just dont see where any increase in sales comes from now tbh - maybe some horrendous flu season combined with a covid varient that sticks us all inside again for months? In which case even then there'll be better places to put your money

Tesla tanking in AH wtf
I know wtf so undervalued rn
Tanking is subjective. I consider 3% plus a tank . I can stomach a few percentages
Losing all today’s gains
Yeah straight bullshit my 1275 calls I paid early thankfully at 180 bucks and I got blessed to see it go up biggest gain was 1800 which I should of cashed out at then it closed and next day premarket dropped 60 bucks yesterday I decided to buy another call same one for like 400 and today I sold one for 1000 so not bad dumb shit i did was buy another 1275 wen it dipped down to 600 and didnt cash out before today wen it was 700 for both co tracts now there at 200 each and not looking good first ah that looks like shit just dropping. I really feel like tommorow it will break out at some point but theta is a fucking bitch .I hope GME at least moons yesterday at open I got a 300c for gme at 500 expire next week and it went up to 1700 and dumbass didnt cashout now its 400 bucks sometimes just take the profit fuck the hype it fucked me over so much
0.5% dude chill out
A whole half point. Holy shit!
.5% is tanking?  If it was F it would be invisible lol
I meant to close my calls and I got stuck holding them… I’m scared now, what was supposed to be a day trade is now gunna fuck me
Tell me about it I was up $885 on GME yesterday but couldn’t trade because I would be a pattern day trader…..now I’m fucking down $500
I don’t want to minimize ur problem but those are small numbers my man… I wish I was only down 500 but tomorrow I’ll have many new buttholes…
#IMAGINE NOT BEING AN ALPHA MALE 🤡🤡
Alpha males aren't even slightly real in human society. The type of man who's capable of being recognized as an alpha is just roleplaying. The type of man who's actually intellectually dominant and not insecure, does not get recognized as an alpha because humans in groups are just roleplaying when they recognize someone as an alpha male, they don't actually want an actual alpha male serving all the social functions of one. 

There might be alpha females tho
You just can’t handle the fact that I’m intellectually and physically dominant in almost every room of males I enter
If that's actually true I can handle it, I just don't think it makes you alpha. In gorilla society everyone would perceive you as a threat until you beat them up and then they accept you as leader. In human society everyone just sees you as a threat and passive aggressively tries to defend themselves from you or preemptively attack you and if you try to beat someone up to proclaim yourself as leader then you'll find the wider group doesn't stop piling on to fight you, ever.

If humans treat you as an alpha male, they're just playing, they wouldn't pick you for that if you were actually intellectually and physically dominant.
I’m just messing around brother 😂

What you wrote was interesting though
I figured it all out from insecurely comparing myself to Brad Pitt. Closest thing we've got to an alpha male human irl
You’re actually just a nerd, living out the fantasy of being “alpha” online while in real life you’re probably the type of guy who apologizes after someone else bumps into them.
Ok tough guy 🤡
Okay at this rate, Pton is oversold lol
This applies when your entire business doesn’t get rekt lmao
No. Look at their market cap
Wow $26B market cap?! Also 8.6k employees, are those mostly sales people? seems crazy.

How fucked are my weekly OTM NET puts bought at close?
You have more guts then I do. I suck at earnings plays but I feel like it's been going literally straight up for so long...how does it not correct at all 😂
That depends on how far OTM and what the underlying does. Basically unless they go in the money you’re fucked.
They were very expensive, I was looking at $11.50 for a 200p.  Stock would have to suddenly shit the bed tomorrow, but stranger things have happened.

Don’t options get IV crushed during earnings
Depends on when they were bought and at what price
Don’t tease me Zuck. You either go balls deep or go back to sleep.

I made 10k today I’ll stay ty though
First one is free
At 4pm, but depending on your broker they could take action sometime after 3 if you don't. If they are ITM they get exercised if you don't sell before then. If they are OTM you sell at a loss before close or they are worth $0 at close
Thanks man
5/11.
What time lol 5/11 starts at midnight… is it then or is it market close
Market close. If you're on RH, do something with them before 3pm Eastern.
Gotcha I’m not but ty lol
5/11
Market close or open?
At 5:11pm.  After that, your money is gone.  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
5:11 today or tomorrow?
Bush did 5/11
Cool
Hold
Those don't expire until May 11.
3:30 if you're on RH 
4:00 by real market hours***

***4:15 for SPY and a bunch of other ETFs
5/11
At market close

Also looks like ATVI Jan calls were a good move. Considering how far out the expiration is, 72.5s yesterday were so fuckin cheap. Up 30% as of close today.
hmmmm:   
$CFLT had a 5-star Quarter  
\+ 67% YoY Growth  
\+ This was a 13% beat higher than expectations!   
\+ 3rd consecutive Qtr of accelerating growth from 64%.  
\+ 15% beat on Q4 Guidance!  $109M higher than $95M previous guide.

$20B market cap, could see them doubling closer to datadog market cap over next few quarters
If they can form this as a trend they will
Their cloud platform is small but growing 250% YoY. That alone can propel them there

11/15/21, have ducks in a row.
How I felt the RDFN call went - We lost a bit of money this quarter, we anticipate losing more money next quarter, yall cool with that?   
Investors(?) - Yeah we cool with that.
> I'm sorry, but I have to ask. How much money are you losing?
I have 4 $45 11/19 puts. So not a lot. Might even make some. Just blown away by the huge selloffs we've seen this week and then such a neutral one from a company consistently losing money anyway.
Anyone know how much 20 11/5 87p bought at 2.60 will be worth at open? Iono if I can sleep tonight
since you'll be deep itm, the delta is 1 so whatever the opening price is subtract that from 87 and thats your rough premium estimate. right now its 63 so if it opens at that price, each contract premium is around 24 so around 48k
Optionsprofitcalculator.com will give you an estimate
Look at options profit calculator it will give you a decent estimate

NVAX... gonna be hella GREEN tomorrow!!!

Hope u bought the dip today!!!
The dip, at the top of the rocket mission?  Not me.
> The original rocket mission was a secret project of the united states air force. It had nothing to do with space travel, but instead focused on creating an anti-gravity device that could be used for military purposes.
I literally bought a call yesterday cause an old boss basically begged me to, so now give me my confirmation bias that this thing rockets tomorrow and why you think so
Did u bother to listen to the ER!? 

Also I told u since 3 weeks ago, u should have listened then!!

In short they have just the final FDA submission which will be coming be months end and they are going to be getting more approval in the coming 2, max 3 weeks for the submissions already submitted.

And the approval received this week will get the vaccine as early as next week!

ITS CALLED SALES!!!!
Am at work and couldnt, I'm only finding this comment for the first time now, you didn't tell me anything lol

I was just wondering why it would run up bigger tomorrow and not right now
It is up already now!? 11 dollars from its close. 

The down day was all based on this:

\*Novavax shares are trading lower in sympathy with COVID-19 vaccine peer Moderna, which dipped after cutting its FY21 outlook.

Thats actually good news for NVAX... just too many stupid people to interpret it right!? What happens when ur competitor cuts outlook based on them not being able to supple product!? The competition, this case NVAX comes in and steals it!!!
To be fair, it was trading higher two days ago than it is right now in PM, I just want this thing over 200 lol
I have been telling people to buy it for weeks now, after the BS report from politico 

It hit is resistance when it went to 202 in premarket, which i said it needed to break it during reg trading with high volume, which it did not, but that is why its called resistance.

Kept the 195 and then dropped today cause of Moderna report, and now made back the bulk of the sympathy loses. With the ER out and the forecasting, even retards should see that it will break the 200 and goo for the next resistance at 250 in the coming weeks, which will be inline with the approval and FDA submission .

With sales forecast NVAX is going back to it all time highs and some!!! And im hold in' 5k shares!!!
Good luck man, my call is for December so I'll happily wait and hold, gonna see how low the IV goes tomorrow lol
are my pltr puts going up?
Sell them, pltr going to break out above 30 soon

Do my wash sale losses just get added to the basis of my last trade? Like if I don't play SPY options for the next month does that work or am I fuk?
Wash sales aren't a big deal, especially if you close all your positions by the end of the year (I know none of you tards are holding long term)
Wash sales for options only apply if you’re selling a certain contract (a specific strike and expiry, like 470c 11/19) for a loss and then re-buying that same exact 470c 11/19 before a month has passed. As long as you move to a new strike or expiry after you realize a loss on a trade you don’t need to worry about wash sales on options
Thx, that's what I thought as well but have read conflicting information. 

I'll file my taxes under my understanding of compliance and they can fix it if they want.
oh shit, NET is slowly fading AH.  
dont do this, dont give me hope....
That ticker has me perplexed. Dumb for buying at these levels dumb for shorting ATHs every day lol
Burn baby burn

Nice. Almost played earnings but had such a good day I didn’t want to sweat a loss after hours. Congrats
Something happened lol
Do you want it all if it’s all mediocre
The put side of my PTON short strangle got its shit pushed in.  Or should I say, it pushed my shit in?
> I'm sorry to hear that.
Short strangle = uncapped downside?
A short strangle is when you sell a put and sell a call at OTM strikes on the same expiration.  I was short the 110 call and short the 80 put, w/42DTE.

It’s a delta neutral position.  Luckily, I’m far enough out to avoid assignment risk, and hedged by the short call.  Still gonna take a bit of a hit though.
IV crush will probably save my ass.
If I had stuck to just buying every single dip on MSFT for the past month, I'd have twice as much money right now.

Ah, well. At least it's about to make me a little cash.
Big question with PENN today and why it kept drilling was wether it was the earnings miss that caused it or portnoy, of it was portnoy which im assuming because i dont think earnings were that bad its gonna moon

You can buy options on ETFs until 4:15 lol
Wow really...fuck, I thought I was getting my order ready for tomorrow. Well that's good to know for last minute plays
Fucking ANET, not sure why everyone is so quiet on this stock. Upcoming buyback and split this month. My calls are ripping rn.
Yeah fuck.... I didn't see that they dipped today until closer to EOD and didn't want to buy at literally the highest price possible

Did you buy calls before earnings? (if you did obviously they are already on the moon i assume.) 

I think it's going to keep going but the chart looks retarded and needs to actually consolidate before I hold longer term
Man when I first heard of this stock it was fucking $419 like 3 days ago and decided to hold off until after earnings like a moron. I said fuck it and bought 540c 12/3 yesterday and was up 70% at one point today. May sell tomorrow along with my PTON puts :)

Either way this stock is ridiculous

NVAX just predicted revenue of $30bn in 2022 from their COVID vax on their earnings call. By the way, this is now the best vaccine in the world. News will catch on soon, no idea why it hasn’t yet other than ‘shills’. 

Better efficacy, longevity, storage/transport ease, side effects than anything mRNA based. (It’s not mRNA based)

I'm just gonna yolo like 50k worth of shares.
Hard to say. Based on past cycles alt coins should explode in q4 and then crash to their true shit value, so jan calls maybe to like 400c?

How bad does PTON get tomorrow?
Did you know you can hold up a tent with a Peloton?
Not at all. It would make too much sense.
Random thought... with Pinterest rising post earnings beat, PYPL will likely follow - potentially ending it's nasty downward trend
What makes you think PYPL uppies? It could still go down more lmao this shit is rigged
What makes me think that? Read my first sentence
So because the first company went up, the second company will go up just because of the first company

My bad I forgot what sub I’m on
Are you not aware of the Pinterest/PayPal connection?
Completely unaware, but I also cannot see how one company determines the financials of another to that degree… that’s nutty if PINS is the majority of their $
PayPal was going to buy Pinterest. Pinterest shot up in value when PayPal confirmed the rumor. Then a week later PayPal said “no deal”… both companies have fallen off a cliff since the announcement
Ok so let me get this straight

One company tried to make a deal with another company
No deal ; stock drops
One company up ah for earnings
So… second one should go up?
Because they tried to make a deal before so they’re intertwined now? 

Doesn’t make sense at all smooth brain af

Maybe I'm just getting old but why do people want to watch twitch streamers perform oral sex on microphones? Isn't regular porn enough?
Pure mechanical sex isn’t arousing, what is arousing is the phantasmatic desire of the other.  Seeing bedroom eyes, hearing husky dirty talk voice, the general performance of sexuality, especially when not accompanied by explicit sexual content, is what is arousing.
This guy is tier 3 sub to at least 18 twitch whores
I don’t even have a twitch account.
well everyone is aroused by different things, I think I figured it out and it's the auditory stimulation from the ASMR is why people are into it, but I think licking metal is not arousing and I go to twitch for wholesome fun not to jack off
Sit like a little bitch on here, twitter, and stocktwists as my $chgg drops to 0.0000000005... ffs I don't get it.
I have begun to reaize a Tesla bot that can fill a human's emotional need will be the best invention of this century.
A TSLA bot that can do that would be a human level intelligence that would immediately become a superhuman machine god general AI. small window for cuddling
Have you seen blade runner brah
Which one of your human emotional needs aren't being met rn?
attention and intimacy 

Tesla-bot providing those will be a game changer. Feeling of accomplishment and other stuff follows the above 2 imo
Idk if a bot can act as a replacement for a real human intimacy. Building trust and happy moments with someone you love is probably one of the greatest joy you can probably feel. 

Having bad relationships can make the future look bleak but I hope you don't give up! There are loyal girls out there who would be happy to build a life with you. The ones who'll stand by you when you're down and cheer you on when you're running towards your dream.

Idk bro wait till tomorrow ends
Ummmmmmmmmmm no
Not necessarily. 

When it went above 52, the owner could have decided to exercise but they didn’t.

Tomorrow it may run above 52, and then you’d be on the hook.
So why is Pton going down so much? I’m confused
They produce top quality baby eating machines.

It is not good enough to buy when there are other options. Only reason people eat it is they have no fucking choice
I dont apparently understand how these earnings things work, I know MM Jack up IV in anticipation, but I swear to fuck I buy puts on an earning and it tanks 5-10% and my fucking put is worth less than I paid for it.??
> You're probably buying put options that are out of the money, which means they will expire worthless.
Well then... you should have told me that countless dollars ago
> I'm not a fucking charity
😳
Yea IV crush n fuck.. oh well. 
NVDA to 330 tomorrow!
Quit buying puts that expire right after earnings, yes IV crush is killing you. Start buying them two weeks before earnings and decide how many in total you want, maybe just buy one and then see what the stock does the next day. 

Secondly, choose expiry that is at least a few weeks after earnings, I’m usually 1-3 months out to see if there are any additional days of pain if buying calls
Good advice.
Thanks degenerates.
you need to do some calculations beforehand. Guess how big the movement will be, then buy options that will be ITM after that movement. you can use [optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://optionsprofitcalculator.com) to help with this.
Yeah I'm buying too far out.. fml know for now.
"MM" do not jack up IV lol, the market itself anticipates large swings so demand goes up and drives up prices on puts. options plays into earnings are never a good move unless you have insider info

But why Feb-Apil? What are you expecting?
I feel like sometime in the late winter/early spring it will finally become legal in the US. The pressure is building and once the new year comes; this is going to become a thing again for the government to take a look at.  They are going to need to start figuring out a way to pay for things and weed is nice start.  It's coming next year.
I hope so. Seems like everyone forgot about trying to legalize weed federally. 

What's your favorite weed stock?
I think this year they have for sure forgotten about it; but I've been seeing more people talk about it and I've read that the beginning of next year things could get heated up again.  I like $CRON, CGC, TLRY & ACB.  I am also going to do some research to find out what banks are waiting to start funding these guys, cause that's going to be a winner as well.  The day legalization is announced the pot stocks are going to have a run the likes we haven't seen since the internet boom of the late 90's.
I'm only in CGC at the moment. There are some OTC weed stocks that some people were talking about at the beginning of the year, all which have fallen significantly since then. Although, I don't want to pay $7 to buy OTC stocks so CGC it is.
$CGC is probably going to be one of the big big winners when the announcement happens.  I'm long on that one for sure. Of course; i personally think any weed stock is going to boom when that happens. The pros (CNBC) will be talking about it for weeks.  It will be a monumental event and everyone will then want to be in on it.
Heck; i want to be ready just for when the rumors start to swirl once again.
No way. They are going to leave it to the states
Loaded up on Jan far OTM Pfizer calls, run up resuming. If congress holds I hold 💯
Nobody tell him the vaxx gives you HIV
Pfizer will sell you the cure for that too 😉
Thoughts on PUTS for NIO (Upcoming ER)?
It’s Chinese so yes, but it’s EV so dangerous. If NKLA can print on earnings, anything in the space can
Goes up leading to er
pop the question
Can I borrow $500
I only need to borrow $300.

If aapl dips tomorrow, i'll probably jump in
First!!!
need uber to crash
Dumping all positions cuz FOMC
Puts on RDFN felt like a smart move. Might do OPEN too.
NKLA?… y’all still buying that when HYLN there at 1/4 market cap with sales being booked this year, to be fair immaterial sales but still sales
Keep going PINS!!
ATVI mega bullish close today
SQ please go up but not too much! 260/245 Iron condor needs ❤️
Uber miserably missed expectations
What’s the news on PTON? What caused the steep drop? Numbers come out? I’m not seeing anything.
Lol thank you, NET. Even though I only have one deep ITM call for Jan.

The rest is just VOO calls that are already up $10k after a week
Capital Hill is bullish on NET
PTON misses didn’t look that horrible to me…
But it did to algos
Lol slashed guidance. That’s all that matters
Yup. Don’t disagree
AMC plans to sell their popcorn in Malls...
Is it free for shareholders tho?
They the only ones who would eat it, so doubt it.
These earnings need to hurry up and drop

breastplates arent real boobs?
Z and OCGN long and NVDA short. trying to play reversals. NVDA would've made me a killing but I started the shorts waaay too early as it turned out. :/
Roll em out son
Thank you to anyone that bough $BB calls at the beginning of the week. My tendies thank you.
DDOG ripping
NVDA shares officially a 40 bagger🥳
Hi
#$DDD the 3D printing company about to print me money
Is it normal for a dentist doing Wisdom Teeth removal to tell you if you don’t pay an extra $500 out of pocket then food will come out your nose when you eat? 😂😂 (no joke, I just had that conversation).

So my avg for Pton is 67. I think we can get back eventually
Dude seriously cut your losses or you’re gonna have to change your handle, give me a counter argument why an at home work out platform that’s tanking as gyms reopen that’s upping its marketing just to cut revenue forecast reporting -1.25eps deserves to be valued at 24 billion.
Honestly I thought it would rebound that’s my only argument :(
Zillow financials still look solid, is there a play here?
Of course there is. They're not going to shut down. They are leaning up the business and focusing on what they do best which is lead generation. They make a killing doing it. Yesterday I sold $55 puts that expire in 01/2024 and I'm up 10% on them already. It's a very low risk play and once I get to 40% profit I'll close it out. I got $1250 in premium for each put sold.
Monthlies for bounce
Not until the housing bubble pops and Zillow isn’t bagholding. Then maybe you can ride them for some upside as we form the next bubble. It’s a 10-20 year cycle for housing
God damn Pton stop it
First thing I close tomorrow is my F calls. No way I get rug bullied. It’s not going to pass $20
Didn’t they say EV once, F 1000% increase
Ummmm this thing is gonna run past $20 no problem. Guaranteed a sell off once it breaks $20 but it’ll run back up and beyond
bad jobs numbers will be the catalyst ...
Anyone rh app not working
Can someone give me the bear case for Moneylion? The revenue and growth for the sector should warrant a much higher market cap
Bought $F leaps back in January. Still have 13 $20 calls for January. Got in the money late last week (i bought that fucking dip), but have been debating my exit strategy. Should I buy a couple cheap weekly puts  for the next couple of weeks as it goes up?
Roll them into $22s and take the credit. If it continues, you still gain. If it doesn't you keep some profits.
I'm thinking owning Activition now that the ship is going down.
AMD puts EZ MONEY
I guess you could say Russian roulette is easy in a sense
DDD
Imagine buying DDD options.
COIN up or dip buying opportunity tomorrow?
Likely down. They aren't ready yet.
I bought stock this week mainly do to hype of doggie coins
Bought some calls today on the dip for the run up to earnings. IV will also spike so it should be easy pickings.
Hope everyone can get into $MVST before it bounces off this bottom up to the moon. 🚀 🚀 🚀 
Long $10c, Mar22
ON has been on a roll.
Yeah but it wouldn’t surprise me if El-Khoury is up to some fraudulent shit trying to get his bonuses. My GF used to work there until recently and it didn’t seem like they were doing too hot from the bits and pieces I happened to overhear. Guy creeps me out though so I could just be biased.
#NEXT WEEK

Monday.com puts for a 5 bagger (earnings)
With NET crushing earnings what makes you think Monday won't
I’m going to buy some you better not be lying Charles
My track record so clean
Damn these puts are expensive. Why do you think it’s gonna fall?
It’s like PTON. Covid gone
They are so expensive but I will trust you and buy some 😬
What strike and expiry are you thinking? 🤔
Spent all this time learning Flutter, just to come to the realization that Angular is probably superior, smh
Futures suck my left nut
Yeah they going green like always.
MMAT calls
I was going back and forth with a guy on picking stocks and individual portfolio performance. So i sent him my performance on a stock…it was performing less than desirable…this doofus sends me his stocks performance for the year and it’s literally the stock performance YTD…it was great by the way
how is babby formed???
D in v
The way your mom behaves its like they form in the throat
Its when woman digs in her asshole and magic powder goes in, then baby falls out
Any thoughts on AUR, Aurora Innovation?
Reindeer taste better than people 🎶
WSB don’t you think that’s true 🎶
You are gay and smell like poo 🎶
🤘
I think Pton is going to play out pretty similarly to bbby. price action after is going to be similar tomorrow b/c bbby also had a disastrous earnings as well. pton will prob tank and then consolidate for a bit and pop back up is my guess

Donkey Kong.... crushing earning tomorrow 
DKNG for the win!

Cathie Wood's buys another 400,000 shares. While the the stock down 4.6%. She’s got some inside info...

Donkey Kong to $100.00
Didn't want anything to do with PENN, but might have to buy the dip now because dumping on Portnoy social life drama might be the dumbest thing I've ever fucking seen
It could be a trickle of allegations before the flood…..or it could be a nothing burger.
I mean, Portnoy probably yeah. The company's already under 20 P/E. I get stock hype but how much can they actually depend on the man for revenue and earnings?

this zack guy has no idea how many bag holders he created
They also rate $NET as a sell. 

Worse than Motley Fool
FD’s on NFLX seem like easy money. Idk.

Today’s drop was pretty over done imo

No one can stop your mom in just two weeks, bro...
RKLB & ASTS Mobile..buy now, thank me later.
In RKLB it’s looking like it’s gonna make a big move
Yep..some launches and news (earnings, the new rocket..) in the near furure will get us easely above the 20$.
My 17c dec calls will be pretty happy if it does
[deleted]
So I have PINS 38 puts expiring today which I bought at open yesterday. I was up more than 100% but decided to hold hoping for a PTON like dump but no, wtf. I wonder how much they will be at open today. My earning plays never work out. I bought ROKU calls and it shits the bed. I buy PINS puts and it moons.
If you want the price to go up sell, if you want it to go down then buy. You're a wizard Harry.
Earnings played
Just wait for shit to do what it’s going to do after earnings. Pick up the pieces of the decent companies that got hammered with cheap IV deflated calls and then start farming profits. 

I’m up 60% on Intel calls since earnings. And it’s only gone up like 5%.

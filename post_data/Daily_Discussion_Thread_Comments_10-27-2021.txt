listen up. im not very clever but I've been skimming trough some annual reports. Many companies increased their operating cash flows last year, but lots of the increased operating  cash flow was really just reduction of inventories. I think they have to increase the inventories at some point and operating cash flows go down just like they went up. SuPPLy CHaiN iSsuEs reeeee. Companies that carry inventory. Just look something like Nike. But nike is quite efficient and streamlined I guess so have a look at some not so efficient that have huge &amp; expensive inventories.

(Shit like this is why I own too much T.)

....I may actually look to be V leaps in a couple of weeks though.

I'm up 200% this week bc I just learned how options work but I'm scared that this will be followed by bad luck for the rest of my life
Wow the recession of 2021 was harsh, I‚Äôll tell my kids about it

You answered right when I tagged you in another comment lol
What was the reason of your purchase and when did you see losses on them today?

AAPL always drags SPY down.  Fuckers.
[removed]
Yeah, that‚Äôs the evil part, not the children in factories, it‚Äôs the lack of a charger.
If you didnt buy SPY calls on that dip, what are you even doing??
Sitting on a 10/29 $40c
So google, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft are just going to sap away value from the entirety of the rest of everything.

10/29 spy calls - a little now and a lot more if we have a morning tank hour.
It was everything all at once... The NASDAQ took it to the face in the same candle, too... so it was a larger market order by a whale or institution. Probably some BS activism or panic on the part of the news that there was progress on taxation in DC is my guess at the moment.

This isn‚Äôt a dump. Just wait.
Fucked by Spy

With no Vaseline
this is why I set aside "fun" money where I still try to make money but my risk profile is way higher. I'll do really risky plays and try to learn from them.

The rest go straight into boring s&amp;p 500 index funds in 401k and roth ira. I try to max it. If I hit it on my risky plays, great, otherwise I still want to retire before I'm an old fart.

Why must you be so mean
Probably gonna be okay. The upswing puts a lot more value on the call. The $20+ move in 10 minutes type of thing it seems to do. I didn't realize $300 more in gains this morning though I sold at the same stock price
Why is spy getting murdered?

Jesus christ, I just need one good win. I nearly bought short expiry puts when we hit 457 again but I pussed out and here we are 45 mins later and SPY is almost $2 lower. So hard to break a losing streak once it gets rolling
Everyone would rather die than admit they are wrong

We‚Äôre massively down because Annaly is having their earnings today :/

If you take out $550 per month, then that means you're keeping an extra $550 per month without putting it in the market (bloated checking accounts are gross), lost $550 in income (stop being a bitch and get that money back), or are spending $550 elsewhere (only acceptable if paying for a lambo).

have  you met spy? it's just goog, tsla, and msft today.
NOK NOK... Just kidding even the chart knows it's flatlined.
20 dollars either way is what I think.
Let me tell you something you already know. SPY ain‚Äôt all sunshine and rainbows. It‚Äôs a very mean and nasty TICKER and I don‚Äôt care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as SPY. But it ain‚Äôt about how hard ya hit. It‚Äôs about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That‚Äôs how winning is done! Now if you know what you‚Äôre CALLS are worth then HOLD until you get what they're worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the DIPS, and not pointing fingers saying you ain‚Äôt as RICH as you want to be because of him, or her, or anybody! BEARS do that and that ain‚Äôt you! You‚Äôre better than that! I‚Äôm always gonna love you no matter what. No matter what happens. You‚Äôre my RETARD and you‚Äôre my blood. You‚Äôre the best thing in my life.

Buy overpriced garbage that is pumping 5%/day for a week, ex TSLA, UPST, NVDA, NFLX, you profit as keep pumping indefinitely, and never pull back, as everyone is rotating into them.

TSLA valuation seems based on the idea that EVs will be SO HOT that people who have one car today will buy 6.  Or that people who need energy will now need 10x as much because it‚Äôs ‚Äúgreen‚Äù

If Tesla does it right, people will need less of both energy and cars, not more of them.

Risk factors are govt intervention, anti trust legislation, shrinking new user base especially if they‚Äôre pressured to change the algorithm to reduce echo chambers, shrinking advert $$ as browser privacy increases become universal.

Whelp, after snatching defeat from the jaws of victory by selling TSLA 10/29 $1,100 and $1,200  last Friday for pennies and picking up PYPL calls I've decided to liquidate everything and hold cash. Well I kept some LEAPS but 80% cash. I don't trust next week at all. Yeah it could be priced in since everything in this world is but I don't like it. Ain't buying puts either because I'm most likely wrong.

No because hope is the first ingredient to getting absolutely fuckin donked in this market. That‚Äôs why I just hold AAPL shares. I do not try to time it.

You realize that's one of the ways multimillionaire and billionaires avoid paying any kind of tax, right? They have unrealized gains in the billions, and so long as they never realize them, there is no capital gains. They can then leverage against their holdings, and never pay any taxes, since their income is usually peanuts.

AMAZN with the penile strength today!  who's playing earnings on this beast?
Imo the best case scenario is already priced in AAPL. Unless the earnings report is very surprisingly good or AAPL gonna announce something crazy, which is very unlikely.
Yeah. I haven‚Äôt touched selling earnings IC‚Äôs since I sold 30 of them on TSLA in Jan 2020. Came within a hair of losing 30K.
I've heard some people lose so much money, that their reputation here is all that matters to them anymore.

#It's my money and I want it now!
im trying to learn more about profiting off SPY calls..can you help me understand what "Scalping SPY calls this morning for $260" means? which calls?
Because I think principles apply to everyone. If someone is really good at playing that doesn't mean I change the rules and violate the logic. It's not being pro billionaire it's being pro policy that allows people to thrive. Some of those people will be billionaires or become billionaires. 

I think billionaires do shady things and avoid taxes and kinds of stuff that I don't like. But there are only trade offs, there are no ideal solutions comrade. And I choose a trade off that maybe helps billionaires but also helps others thrive. I don't want a trade off where we stick it to billionaires but decimate others to do so.

That's fair
Bear with an autist for a moment - let‚Äôs say TSLA hits 1100 or even 1200 tomorrow. Is there a chance the contract can go up to .72 again? Currently at .06 or so. Also, any good resources to learn more thoroughly about options?
I‚Äôm gonna make money today. I am going to do the opposite of what i would normally do. Hold, when I‚Äôm inclined to sell. NOT buy the dip, when I‚Äôm inclined to do so.

Buying puts is one of the most capitalistic things you can do in the market, maybe second only to selling puts and calls.
It‚Äôs almost as if the combined 500s ups and downs relatively even out, making it a more accurate gauge of the market overall?

Seriously...does anybody even look at earnings reports? Tesla is killing it.

That is correct. SPY makes sense, everyday, all the time, never does weird shit.

as a long term hold, yes this is a pretty good entry point for shares
Same but on 1010 puts. May the best man win

Literally exactly same thing for me lol
Realized or paper losses? It's not a loss if you don't sell.
Only have a few shares, but bought some calls after earnings drop thinking it would go back up some. Not so much

Dump all my $SPY calls and 10/29 into QQQ $386 Calls. At least it is more exciting to watch today then $SPY. Good Luck!
Bought FB fds wish me luck
MSFT and Pokemane bringing down the NYSE
i can't tell if spy is about to dump or pump
they're still undervalued. see all the people who are comparing their valuation to other automobile manufacturers? that's an incorrect comparison that's like comparing apple to radio shack because apple has apple stores
what dip?
Xlf seriously I have a family
Ok so I‚Äôm trying this new thing. 1000 bucks, trading 0/1dte spy contracts putting a sell limit at 35%. According to my calculations I should be a millionaire in 23 trades‚Ä¶ so just over a month. Will report back with findings
I never buy tesla puts...but this time I am lol
Depends how much people hold and keep

They gonna drop whatever but probably not enough to be worth puts

Tasty has a decent mobile app but it definitely has terrible charting on the app. The desktop platform is great, I prefer it to TOS.

/u/FelixJuggl3r (2/0) made a bet that GOOGL would go to 2900.0 when it was 2778.0 and it did, congrats fucker.
SNAP needs to SNAP outa it
If $PYPL was going up 5% every day and was currently $400 the same people selling now would be buying it at $400
Turns out the easy play was to buy MSFT or GOOG calls at open. I need to stop staring at the screen and just pull the trigger. I was way more ballsy months ago when I had less than half the cash I do in my account.
Damn why is MSFT up 4%
man be careful, feel like this run has shades of 2020 to it. could go on for awhile

Glad I didn't paper hand that AMD call in the opening volley whiplash. Don't bet against tech
Best way to play AMZN earnings is to just follow the momentum after earnings is announced.  It's not likely to move much at first, but will likely move $50-100 in the same direction that it moves after earnings are announced.

Look at the momentum we're seeing out of MSFT/GOOG.  AMZN is likely to follow that pattern with a ton of money rotating in or out.  You'd have been much better off buying GOOG calls at open today than yesterday.

You do not need to buy high vol options beforehand that require it to open up or down $75-100 to break even.
you do it king
Those are some of the most retarded strangle strikes I have seen on SPY

Naw, great cloud/ad numbers out of GOOG and great cloud numbers out of MSFT probably means a decent beat for AMZN.

Worst it goes sideways, don't see any big downside there (but of course I could be wrong).

Best play for AMZN is probably just pile on the direction it goes after earnings are announced.  Likely to see momentum in either direction.

TSLA repeat of yesterday
Play today is the same thing it's been for 10 years+ now.  Just keep rotating into big tech.  Dance while the music is playing.

I think there's a decent chance we see a big AMZN breakout at some point given what we're seeing out of MSFT and GOOG.  Obviously AMZN has the cloud operation and also the ad revenue coming in, and those are 2 big reasons why those first 2 are powering forward.

Just requires investors to be fine with the post-Covid situation of Amazon's retail ops, which I think don't have downside left at this point; stock's consolidated over a year now +/- 400.

Plus it's not like Twitter or Facebook in the early days when they somewhat gradually went from 0 users to millions. It took Facebook over 2 years to get to 20 million users for example. For Trump's social media network we're potentially talking about tens of millions of users instanly trying to gain access and sign up from day 1.

The good thing with Tesla is that it will begin to lose volatility, but at the cost of being sold off for profit taking. At that point, the profits are then used to buy back into Tesla, keeping it in the 1,000 level. Tesla makes a wonderful product and is a wonderful company. They may dip here and there, but Tesla will continue to rise.

If DWAC actually reaches a user base as large as people think it will, then they will either have to build their own data centers or host on AWS or Azure, there isn't anyone else big enough to handle that scale.

Can spy finally rip ffs
if you gotta ask you know what to do
Get far more time than you really need, theta can be a bitch. She takes from you every day. Pay for more delta when you‚Äôre confident less when you‚Äôre not. Volatility changes everything. When it‚Äôs low you can calculate potential outcomes (change x delta) - (theta x days). When volatility is high take your profit and run if you‚Äôre holding,
or write contracts to sell to some stoop if your have the coverage.

UPST requires steel nuts to trade. Got 20k puts this morning, and was immediately down 10k at 9:40. Up 4k now. FDs and monthlies. I have confidence it's gonna continue down for a couple days but damn it has fun making you question yourself.

&gt; Actually, the word "degenerate" is derived from a Latin term meaning "to degenerate," which in turn comes from de- ("away") and generare ("beget"). So if you're going to be technical about it, then no one went broke taking profit.

Lol. We are gigabrained morons, aren't we?
Panic sold my tsla calls for a loss then it immediately jumps 2% ü§°
Anyone holding AFRM thru today?
This is the type of confirmation bias i come here for
I've been watching the price trying to figure out a decent call because i feel it's gotta go back to 400.

one last little bump, but agree
From what I understand the source code for the social media platform is stolen (possibly open source?) with no changes, the company has no infrastructure, and it‚Äôs all operating purely on maga hype. If I could have gotten in at 10 just to ride it up and sell I would have , just to get extra capital to puts the way down and profit from stupidity. I think it -may- ‚Ä¶ May jump up again at actual launch (if it ever makes it that far), but it‚Äôll crash and burn harder and faster than the Hindenburg.

You realize that they don‚Äôt matter? The actual numbers, the timeline, etc. doesn‚Äôt matter. 

What matters is they were raised. By as much as 30%. Traditionally this is catalyst enough to push stock higher immediately. 

And they‚Äôre on track to grow 65% this year. So no, it‚Äôs not for a year out. A year out would be +50% at least.

Are you saying it wasn't your feefees, it was the devices not selling well and Valve pivoting? 

Because in that case, it still sounds like your feefees, since prototypical products aren't supposed to sell well and Valve didn't pivot.

Why pretend not doing something it's not supposed to do is a failure, other than feefees? 

Why pretend Valve had to pivot, other than feefees?
Momentum and gaps being filled is a real thing.

It doesn't have to hit $1500 for you to make money though...When ever I calculate potential gains, on an otm option, I always price the stock somewhere under the strike price, and if the gains are worth it, I take it.

They typically drop after earnings and I think with the chip shortages this might happen again.  This is a buying opportunity as F is a long term solid play.  So buy the dip and don‚Äôt look back.
SPY -&gt; $30 EOD
[removed]
&gt;The Wyden plan would require the very wealthy ‚Äî those with over $1 billion in assets or three straight years of income over $100 million ‚Äî to pay taxes based on unrealized gains. At that tier of wealth, the logic goes, the usual considerations arguing against a so-called ‚Äúmark-to-market‚Äù capital gains tax don‚Äôt apply. Those are sophisticated taxpayers with access to loans or other source of liquidity, for example, who hold assets that for the most part can reasonably be valued annually.

If you don't have over 1B in assets stop complaining

You're having a hard time understanding this, so let me break it down into bullet points:

* You are not very smart.
* You are acting like you know more than you do.
* You base your opinions on nothing.
* You are talking to someone who obviously knows more than you, and you're acting like that's not true.
* You're trying to use baseless opinions as your positions in an argument with someone who actually has a basis for their opinions.
* You need to improve your mental health.

I think F is very volatile due to the investment they did on UK plants for ‚Ç¨230M ($316M) plus that chip shortage could be a reason for it to go bearish after market. They also claimed that by the year 2030, Half of it's global sales will be from EVs. A huge turn around would be if F actually gets into a contract with USPS for their new vehicles in the future and if the 506 units of the Ford Maverick 2022 sold last month was big enough and did you know that whales produce about 974 liters of pee everyday?

UPST looks like it has a long way down to go.
Korean DWAC hybrids
What stupidity are they up to now? I've lost track of which fuck up is top of mind. Just off the top of my head we have:

737 Max was not airworthy 
Starliner wasn't designed with FL humidity in kind
The 787 is also in trouble. 

What else?

Hoping $IINN and $OCGN rocket‚Ä¶ üòì
Today's Hertz-Uber deal to have Uber use 50k Teslas is huge. It doesn't have a direct incremental effect on $TSLA's earnings but it obviously increases brand awareness, introduces more customers to Teslas and puts more pressure on others to electrify. Anyone getting to experience a Tesla for the first time becomes obsessed with it and is almost a guaranteed future owner. Only some poor peasants hate it. Remember Tesla still pays exactly $0 in advertising.

Just saw a comment about the hertz-uber-tsla-cvna deal being stupid and I want to bring a contrary discussion to the thread. I feel like this is a good move for all of the parties EXCEPT for the uber drivers themselves, but there are even cases where this will be GOOD for them. This deal for hertz will only be in 4 major cities where cars are an issue. This allows people without cars to now be able to pick up some side gigs with uber. Their profits will be diminished due to the costs of renting the vehicle but hopefully due to the decrease in gas expenses and increased premium of uber riders riding in a luxury car it might make up for not owning the vehicle. This looks like a huge win for all.....

We know they are going to shit the bed on the earnings call, they haven't been making or selling hardly any vehicles due to the chip shortages.  They are up 22% from the pre-pandemic levels (64% up from the pandemic lows). Even companies who report decent numbers have been selling off post-earnings. Only the super-beats are getting any kind of positive runs.

I eat a fuck ton of food, adderall diminishes my appetite but my genes never allow me to just not eat. I also have an issue of drinking TOO much water, relative to my sodium intake at least. Before I realized the amount of water I was drinking was throwing my electrolytes out of whack I was constantly thirsty, peeing all day long, waking up to pee... overhydration has the same symptoms of dehydration so it felt like I was thirsty but my body was really asking for sodium. I've since upped my sodium intake and have pretty much solved it. The sodium has actually increased the effectiveness of my adderall which is cool

The last Queen of England was [Queen Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain) who, with the 1707 Acts of Union, dissolved the title of King/Queen of England.

####FAQ

*Isn't she still also the Queen of England?*

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

*Is this bot monarchist?*

No, just pedantic.

24, went my entire childhood without it because my parents didn't believe I had any issues(even though I was in remedial english classes my ENTIRE life). Was discussing ADD with my friends freshmen year of college who have it and a lot of what they experienced was what I experienced. Long story short after barely scraping by in my 4years of college(majored in Math because of my inability to focus on reading) and my Psychologist not believing adderall would help me, I went out on my own after graduating and got a doctor to prescribe it to me at the ripe age of 22. Game changer, I would have crushed college if I had a constant adderall source

i'm not even saying anything about agreeing with them or not, just what's with the obsession with these labels and groups idk what half this shit means. and why where it so openly like that where's the motivation to learn through discussion

some of these accounts i even like honestly since a lot of them actually are intelligent with interesting takes, it's just so bizarre to me. i can't imagine they have jobs or non-online social lives

I think you gotta take a step back and learn a little more. I recommend parking your money in something stable that's upward like SPLG, that's basically SPY's little brother but for $50 a share. Read and watch videos, I guess focus on options to accelerate growth. You could also look into leveraged ETFs which are like double and triple the "odds"

So, I have no money sitting on legit nothing (put into perspective I cannot even own a Facebook stock atm.) I was just trying to figure out how to eventually after saving make my way in? Always is a risk I know, but I cannot do options, I can baerly do day trading, and if you cannot do options you cannot really do futures either, so kinda lost. Amy advice or help?

I have yet to fuck a white girl idk what it is man but the black chicks love it so I‚Äôm cooling it over here
I‚Äôm really not understanding the big push to break up Facebook. I think it‚Äôs trash, but I don‚Äôt have a problem with a company acquiring other trash like WhatsApp and IG if that‚Äôs what they want to do. Facebook is doing the same bull shit Amazon has been doing with Alexa, and google with their bullshit to feed ads to people . Who cares. It doesn‚Äôt hurt me or influence me personally. I‚Äôm a god damn individual with my own brain and choice. The whole witch-hunt to break up these companies seems more like  America pointing the finger at corporations when in reality it‚Äôs just our citizens that are absolutely and utterly complete dumbasses with an IQ that‚Äôs barely at an elementary level.  So many people in this country have no ability to critically think.

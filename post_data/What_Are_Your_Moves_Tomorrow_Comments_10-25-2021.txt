Ah, where did you think you were? Wendy’s? Sir, this is a casino.
If I had 1 cent for every retard in this community I'd have

And if we know imagine each one of you charge approximately 1 $ for a blowjob behind Wendy´s that would be enough to cover 301 years of constant blowjobs, everyday. Now that's an investment with great returns.

Tesla puts
Dear lord Tesla !
astra is a good buy right now. once they get to orbit (hopefully on wednesday) it'll easily be worth 10x what it is now. idk im not very smart.
Puts on DWAC. There’s never been a surer thing.

Isn’t that like gambling?
Same, but I’ve had to learn the hard way throwing too much money at each play has been worse than being like taking small bites of a lot of plays. Plenty have gone -100%, but enough +500% to waaaay offset the losers
Disck, HBOmax is a fantastic product with strong growth ahead.  I started buying after I watched Godzilla on my couch and still think it's great after Dune.  Now the time to be buying in.  Disck or T for the combined company

PYPL
What pattern is that? Crashing and burning?
calls on SENS and DXCM
Who would buy that after all the pump and dump shit corn scandals?
How could you possibly tax unrealized gains. On what day would you be required to do this. Can you take tax losses for unrealized losses and again on what day of the year would this be calculated? Is is idiotic.
&gt; "I would buy some calls on the SPY, which is an ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500. I like this because it's very liquid and you can get in at a decent price."
What calls would u buy if u had extra couple g?

Probably means the action. All over the place

Bloomberg put a video on YouTube yesterday about Carl Icahn trying to take over the OXY board again.  This seems like old news since he spent half the year trimming his position.  Is he making another play for control or is Bloomberg just posting old videos?   I'm not sure he gets how good the seeds they planted with Oxy low carbon ventures are.  I don't want that sacrificed for a dividend.  This seems like old news though.  He can't possibly be mad still about Warren Buffetts 10 billion in preferred shares considering the 300 percent move the stock has made since this time last year.

I hope Yellen &amp; Biden realize that not even Communist China is taxing unrealised gains, simply because it's idiotic.

That's just a populist move to appeal to the retarded masses and tell them *"see? we really tried our best but the evil rich prevented us from doing it.

I don't even care if Mango hits 200 today cause I'm not selling til 500, the float is ridiculously small, just wait til t+2 when brokers actually have to deliver our shares.. I just want to win my bet with some other asshole on here that she sets new aths within a month.

Yea, back up over 90 🤡

I don’t think they ban so much as delete posts but just think it’s strange they are usually sticklers for the rules

I’m kinda sure
god dammit why is the dash to trash still going. BTC, TSLA, meme stonks, SPACs, ARKK, etc. And even trashier SPACs than before. Mango SPACs headquarted in a bowling alley in Jakarta. this is bear hell ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
And as it stands, given the current state of everything, you think that matters a whole lot?
BREAKING: In a suprise announcement, the SEC states that is has ordered Elon Musk removed as CEO for violating agreement concerning making statements that could influence stock prices outside of official channels.  Reportedly, Greta Thunberg has been chosen as his successor.
But won’t necessarily go up
what company is Mango??? Sorry for being so smooth brained.
lol do u even read the news? they aren’t acquiring pinterest.
Hopeium. No news or reason for it other then mango
tax on unrealised gains? move ur brain out of your asshole biden
It’s been on a tear since may
TIL TD ameritrade doesnt allow premarket trading until 7am FUCK
It's already up nearly 300% how would it make sense to even get in now
A stock up 400 percent since Friday with no actual news or reason for then jump? Selling the house now
Bruh, how many 🥭 stocks are there?
I suspect mango bagholders will have another chance of unloading the bags today lol. I Missed the train but maybe I’ll get in now that options are available.
Fridays price action, the morning bounce then the selloff and new weekly low forced me to close my 10/29 $260c at a loss because it was getting too far otm for me after buying on Thursday. I bought with hopes that it'd bounce and close $245+ on Friday...
yup this. as long as the bid ask spread is decent, just buy at market. been too many times i put in a limit order and not managed to buy solid companies on the dip
🥭 related. P and d
It went down on rumours of buying PIN .. but they aren't so now it's oversold and earrings coming up
Mark my words, you'll make money today if you get it in premarket
Looks like your PYPL Isnt going to be fukt
How d you get shook out? 


Why rebound now it’s pre market don’t rely too much on it.
Why will it rip 


Just add W to end of ticker
DWAC to the moon pls? 


Only put strike will be $35 unfortunately. Maybe more added later as stock falls. If premium high enough though, $35 may still be worthwhile. Need $25 prem tho that’s unlikely.


Could do some math about mixing other aspects
🤡Imagine buying DWAC at $172 🤡
Yep.
Wow volume on the SPACs is still insane, i think we might see another PUMP 🚀

I hear that, after a few of these you'll start saying fuck it. You'll be a better trader going forward.

"Missing on x dollars a share isn't worth potentially saving x cents a share up front"

You'll remind yourself that the amount is arbitrary in either direction. An additional 5 cents a share if you're wrong is a negligible loss &amp; the same principle applies to the five cents a share less profit if you're right.

S&amp;P new all time high this week surely
Why are you happy to see "bagholders"? I get enjoying loss porn, but I don't understand when people are oh so happy that others lost money on a stock. Kinda seems like envy that they missed the boat when it shot up and are now happy others failed too. 

I got out of DWAC at $199.99 by some miracle, but I feel bad for those who didn't get as lucky as me, or for those who chased the stock, bought the top, and are now hoping for more Mango miracles. 

I guess I'll never understand schadenfreude.
Why a merger should always have a cross product? In many case it can be due to leveraging other company supply chain, market dynamics many more. In this case Nike is not having a huge market share in casual wear by a acquisition it might be trying to have one.

The volume on Mango stock is CRAZY. Nearly 5% of shares outstanding is being traded in the first 17 minutes of premarket. We shouldn't call it daytrading anymore. It should be called nighttrading...

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Omfg Ive got PYPL 242.5c 11/5 and it's up almost $14 right now pre-market
RIP SNAPCHAT?
Never had an opportunity like DWAC 😭😭😭
How can I know when a stock is about to be available for public buy ? And it will shoot up
BENNY WTF
Guess it's too late for pypl

Fuck MangoBook. Should have bought AH on friday :(
god bless my PYPL calls
Yea it just seemed like it couldn’t find a bottom, but PayPal already lost more in their market value than the 45B they were offering to acquire Pinterest. I took the opportunity to go from 6 calls to average down and get 20 calls cause I didn’t think it made sense for pypl to want to continue to purchase that acquisition anymore. And with ER around the corner too..so I diamonded handed
The rate it’s going I dunno if I can afford calls anymore LOL. Iv is gonna be bonkers xD
Old indian trick
Don't pop the cork until you're ready to be stuck on the toilet for a while. Deployment food on a ship tends to stop you up, so if you start eating extra veggies and fruit at the end of every meal (putting the powder behind the rounds, so to speak) then you'll experience it at least once or twice.
If these 451p hit today I'll be happy and go back to sleep

Wtf? Yo mod? What’s this shit?
I work in a lab dealing with SARS-CoV-2 and getting results to patients, and yep, we're expecting a huge upswing in the coming months due to a multitude of factors including newer variants that somewhat ignore defenses provided by the vaccine. That's not to say that the vaccine is useless, as it still protects against severe disease and hospitalization, but recent studies show that vaccinated individuals still spread the virus about as much as unvaccinated. Of course, if everyone was vaccinated, this would be a different story. Alas, that's shown to be impossible over the past year.
Actual shitposting. Nice.

Me.
There will be no more lockdowns. I am as cautious as they come, but even I have accepted the fact that covid is here to stay... people will not listen, and those who wanted to get vaccinated have already done so. It's just something we'll have to live with I guess, or until covid mutates enough to turn into a plague to open people's eyes
Fuck it, we all die.

No way that passes. If it does get your 195P ready. That would be a good way to nuke themselves for 2022 elections.

Well that explains it.  You're in an academic setting where those things matter.  They'll continue to matter, albeit to a lesser degree, in your continued professional life.  That said.  If your English professor wasn't giving you shit about using slang and jargon in your course work, or class room discussions, I'd say you need to get a refund on your tuition ASAP.
DARE taught me all i need to know about drugs

Why do people interpret typing caps as yelling? Like bro, it’s just text on a screen.
Is the Biden admin taxing unrealized gains going to tank the market?
Damn, makes not feel too bad about being 40k off from my high, thank you kind stranger
My take is PINS isn’t a great platform anymore, 

so that deal being off means PYPL will have more cash and they’re not buying an outdated platform
What makes you say that about RIOT?

Well.  It's one thing to have a good vocabulary and use it appropriately.  It's another thing to tell someone you possess a staggering lexicon.  The first option shows that you're erudite.  The second shows that you're an idiot who desperately needs to sound smarter than their peers.

You are correct in the fact that Spider-Man 2 is the most superior. I watched that one very recently tho :-/ so I excluded it.

You're locked in a 4x4 ft room with Jim Cramer. All he does is imitate squidward for 16 hours a day, stopping only to sleep. The only way to leave the room is you have to blow him. Do you do it?

The go-to insult other people have for me has always been "you look like a mass shooter." My only comeback is "Hey! Don't give me any ideas!"*finger guns*
There's gotta be a better comeback.
Gotta wake up 5 minutes before market open so I can "gauge" whether I should buy calls or puts on DWAC. Def gonna use a day trade on that cause I don't think it'll be wise to keep it overnight. Maybe sprinkle on some AMKR and LOGI puts for their earnings. And then majority of my play will be some AMD calls. Can't wait for su bae to show me a new ATH =D

Comparing Trump's first venture after his presidency, especially one after his first term before his very likely run for a second term, to any business venture before his presidency should really be done with a grain of salt.

It'd be like saying that Obama wrote a book before he was president and nobody cared to publish it, then betting that a publisher won't pick up a book up he writes after his presidency.
Fuck if it blasts off from this I’m gonna be pissed.. I got in a bidding war with the option writer on Friday over 10 cents a share and ultimately didn’t get my fill

Obviously i was responding facetiously, but I also truly believe that it's unlikely.

This is coming right off his presidency and Trump needs to retain all the support he can for a 2024 run.  It seems unlikely that he would do something greedy that would risk this.

I jumped on board back in Feb, but only uranium plays until recently. Just picked up a handful of CLF and hold some bags of an OTC oil company (lol). I think more CLF and more uranium mining stock are all I'm going to put money into for a while.
I accidentally realized some short term gains like a tard. Paying an extra 7% for the gain now in taxes :/

The vaccine should protect you from hospitalization, so if you are worried get the vaccine. But that's not the point. The point is that vaccine were mandated because they were suppose to prevent spread. We now know you carry the same viral load meaning you spread it regardless of if you bare vaccinated. Therefore the reason for the mandates is null and void. Everyone should be tested because we can all spread it regardless of vaccine status.

Nah.  I think certain films will draw crowds but many others will be mostly empty showings.  Halloween Kills (on a weekend, despite being the afternoon) right before the actual holiday is a no-brainer for a packed house.  Whether or not those events, or star wars / avengers style blockbusters are enough  to keep more than one theater chain afloat, I cannot say.
I have been preparing with starburst wrappers for years. The time has come to discretely use my tongue to twist your testicles like a pair of tangled headphones and sterilize you.

I'm not interested in buying shares,  but I went to see the new halloween last weekend at 330 in the afternoon and the theater was packed.  I live in the suburbs of NJ for reference, so that's a really small sample size, but it definitely wasn't dead in there.

What kind of technology shit snap is working on? Zero nothing. Seriously people who pulled money out of fb going to regret it and fomo it once it goes 400. Out of all faang company with potential growth and low priced is fb.

If I want to buy DWAC (commons) should I submit a pre-market order for DWAC (Monday morning) or do you think I should wait and watch it trading live when the market opens? Pros and cons of the pre-market order (at around current levels)? Debating what to do (other than not play this at all). ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Yellen yelled they have control over inflation, so it must be true.

Might buy puts.
Hell yeah bruv
DWAC is WSB Crack
(you already know, but for those that don't) Scrapers pick it up, and with enough mentions it appears in some autogenerated article so it does do something.... But yes price wise it's useless.

At least they out themselves. Sell options to those suckers

Nah I hold it to pump out covered calls every week. The premiums are nice and I'd wager will continue to be until February or March due to the holidays.

Wait what if we 100% subsidize healthcare?
Amd will be 135. Why you people have no DD buying puts? Amd is growth company with solid earnings. Since intel beat up only thing that can go up is amd now. With xilinx deal coming close you guess what it will be
Yes, buy AMD puts on Wednesday. Post your massive gains 😂
If it keeps running up I might

what are your thoughts on buying AMD puts right before close on Wed right before ER is announced?  
INTC puts were probably a 5-10 bagger anyone see a reason why AMD wont be the same? i figure they have identical supply chain issues as intel...

Lol the guy that owns 6.5m shares of tsla that Dave lee just interviewed: I don’t have enough money to own more shares so I had to buy $1m worth of calls
What calls you buying?
You should prolly get off reddit and sleep
#should I buy dwac calls
A few reasons.

1. New cars in some markets are sold out which increases the value of the next best thing, used cars.

2. Massive parts/chip shortages are giving dealerships pricing power to increase prices above sticker. They know people will pay it.

3. A lot of people who banked with stimmy funds can now afford a new/used car. Which exacerbates the problem.

4. People being afraid of public transportation/COVID are now buying cars to protect themselves.
Same my guy but thanks for the input lol
Not enough homophobia in the thread tonight, going to bed

I know absolutely nothing so my best bet is that it will go up or down.

Yea but I’m not buying this late. It’s obviously a pump and dump and I’m too late to do anything except maybe scalp

I find private party Is reasonable but dealerships are trying to sell something and are actually selling used cars for more than new ones. Basicly, consumers see the window sticker and question the 2K markup but used cars don't have that sheet and get a 10K markup.
thank you for that question its an important question...

For you I’d recommend going for the boost of moderna. Apparently has the longest lasting antibodies. But where you’re wrong is whether your son is **vaccinated or not he is still just as likely to spread covid to you** if he was to become infected. There are some studies that say he’s 8 times less likely to catch covid however if he were vaccinated so if that’s true that would help your chances of him getting infected and spreading it to you. 

The point of the whole story was that if a vaccinated person gets infected they still spread the virus the same as an infected unvaxxed person. They carry the same amount of viral load whether vaccinated or not.

I wish you the best

I’ll give you my scenario I am high risk and got the j&amp;j vaccine in March because it was the first available. It’s probably useless now because of time. He’s 10 and in school full time. He can’t get vaccinated. They JUST authorized booster shots for me. The choice of not being vaccinated does effect me. I really don’t care about opinions
We're all the same stardust and even real money is less significant than monopoly money but this reality just hits so hard that they got us ensnared in needed to work for our own survival while keeping us away from our true mother, Nature.

Thanks random internet guy. I will throw my entire bank on calls. Who needs rent money anyways
Lol you’re right. I think it dumps on earnings. Should show growth decelerating. Hoping it does so I can get in
Why are used cars that were 6k last years selling for 20k+ now. It's nonsense
It went to 18 and fell back to 11’s 🤷‍♂️

Mods ? Can we get that ?
Lol! Oh yeah! Thanks!
Snap fell off a cliff friday and usually the best time to buy the calls is when the stock is low. It fell 25%, it should rebound. Get those long calls maybe idk
EOW
no it wasn't that's what it closed at IPO day because it tanked at open
reeee I broke visualmod, stand by
Just had the song pop up in my head
Oof I relate. Imagine having money make you money
My take is people saw DWAC go to $175 so they’ll think it possibly can too. I don’t have a position but I’m very interested to see what happens.
people will bid it up before earnings cause it's basically at IPO price now. I expect it to be $42 Tuesday at bell
Baba $300 eoy

That’s true but your son unless he has pre-existing  health conditions isn’t really at any serious risk. Over 60 million people under 17 years old in America and there’s been about 500 deaths total in that age range. A normal year of the flu is similar or worse. For kids under 5 I believe the number is  around 30 deaths in America from covid.  Also a plus is kids don’t seem to be getting the long haul covid symptoms in a significant amount

Dude that must have been literally the worst experience of your life. I’m glad you got through it without doing anything rash. I know people who would have harmed themselves if that happened while they were tripping.

Lmao hey man I usually don't have any problems with betting on some immoral shit. Bought puts all the way through the covid crash and even cheered a little. I just don't want anything to do with you know who or anything he touches

I got a new scam/blackmail email..  
Wondering if any of you have gotten one of these.  
It said something like 
'We hacked your cam and we have videos and stills of you jerking off.. we will expose you on the internet and socials if you don't pay this amount'.  
 
I'm thinking fuck it, print it.
I hope so

Sometimes if the apartment price is too good, you'd be stuck in a decrepit building that loses power every month, a unit that hasn't been cleaned since the 1930s, and the smell of second hand smoke wafting in from your neighbors who literally don't do anything all day.

Already ran 35% up the fuck you buying more calls for? It's not a meme play or a "shorts" play. Was a growth play and it's already grown plenty. High chance you missed the boat. I got shares and would love to see it spike another few $ but I'm doubtful we see 25 till December.
That’s alpha 😎
Calls or puts that are very short term plays like 3 days till expiry (DTE) that can double, triple your money in a single day.

Women have had a sex life before they meet you. Once you get over that, you can have a meaningful relationship.
I’ve seen a real bull before. A glorious beast radiating power and fat gainz. True chads in a land of soy and sloppy breakup posts. Their energy permeates the very essence of those deemed worthy, and I crave to one day run with my brothers again. 

The bulls I see here, now, are but mere caricatures of these behemoths. Empty shells led astray by the promise of false tenders. A stain upon the gentle memory of bulls who not only bought the dip, but sold the rip. Rip in peace

Poor bears haven’t figured out that the market literally keeps going up for the sole purpose of fucking them in the ass. Fundamentals haven’t mattered at all this year, baba is trading at a p/e of 18 while inferior Amazon is over 60 p/e. Only when the last bear finally gives up will the spy actually start going down.
Yeah I don’t see a flood of buying no matter what they say.

I'm thinking hedgies like Shitadel are holding tons of SPY, QQQ, TSLA so they're not going to let it tank until retail buys up their bags. Everyone is afraid market is going to go down so it's probably going to keep going up. Also Shitadel needs more money to keep shorting GME so they have to keep pushing the market up higher to keep up with retail buying up GME shares and DRSing to ComputerShare.

Cool...whats the prize money? Just 1 game right?
175 looks like the mean for the range. If it oscillates between 170 and 180 like this for a while, I'd be fine with it. Swing some easy calls at the bottom and wait for a breakout.

I think DIS is going back up. It's a little worrisome that it broke the bottom of the channel, but I think it's unwarranted. If you've seen their annual pass changes, they're doing everything they can to make more money.

China doesn’t need to take Taiwan by force, they already own half the planet and counting. US thinking they can stop them is like a child saying they can fight a dragon, just completely groundless. China can wait to get Taiwan later on, they don’t need it as much as the media tries to proclaim they do. Taiwan will rejoin by choice within 20 years once they realize there’s no other option.

Now they’ll pour their money back in with earnings and the announcement that they have plans to continue profits despite apples bitch ass changes

I vote we start having new versions of bets on here. Bull vs Bear. Where two individuals take the ultimate risk for our amusement. Agreeing on a number of options and selling opposing sides. 

So for example; a bull on a stock will sell 1,000 cash covered puts. And a bear on the same stock sells 1,000 cash covered calls. Same expiration date. And let us all watch the drama unfold.

I don't mind reading it but at the same time I've just gone through the numbers a ton of times and just don't see why the risk/reward ratio is great at these prices for another double anytime in the next 3 years.

I don't mind see another perspective though.

There's just too many other plays that look better right now to me, especially small caps with IWM/Russell 2000 looking perfectly consolidated after 8-9 months.

The point of my post was more just along the lines that there's better plays out there than ones we already played.

TSLA will be there the same way AMZN is.  But it might move sideways like AMZN until it proves it can grow to that kind $1.5tn valuation.

The inherent Nihilism inside these psychopathic humanoids existed long before social media, but it’s certainly more prevalent in today’s digital world… it’s just easier to promote and inculcate nihilism upon these mushy  pliant minds now that everyone is networked , centralized and  reliant on  the matrix… btw; bullish $SNAP, $LCID and $TSLA

TLDR: This dude is becoming full time retard in this sub starting tomorrow
Ya so
I'm considering shorting DWAC as well, but I don't think the source code argument makes much sense. Loads of legitimate business leverage open source software in a way that is core to their business. The licenses typically don't require that any modifications you make be open-sourced.

Last week we had a meeting... about a meeting... to plan about planning. Later in the day when we were to present our findings to management, the big boss guy no showed with no notice.

It's not his fault, he's busy as fuck - but that was it. The day I realized the guaranteed money and security was no longer worth my time, or the stress, or the soul numbing Zoom calls.


I'm writing my letter of resignation tonight. More as a form of catharsis. Don't know when I'm going to hand it in. Maybe in a month, because then that store on the way to work will have their homemade fudge ready and I can hit them up one more time.


I had the opportunity to "retire" and become a full-time trader this summer. I balked and didn't take it because I thought it would be really cool to lose $25,000 and 3 months of my life on CLNE first.

vibranium, while useful, is very difficult to forge, limiting its uses.  Unobtanium is very useful in theory but until a more readily available supply becomes available, its adoption for those uses will be slow to non-existent.
The long term growth is limited by the number of crabs your enchanted forest can produce, though. Gotta start thinking long term and give crabs to as many people as you can now so when it takes off you’ll be ready.

You joke but I could definitely see a future where the majority of the middle class no longer has full time jobs as we think of them now. I think instead of people relying on one major source of income to live we will move towards people utilizing multiple smaller income sources. Most People would still work because jobs give us something to do and give us a feeling of purpose but we wouldn't be beholden to our employers. wages would become more competitive across the board as the labor market gets squeezed by a workforce that isn't desperate for a means to pay there bills.

Either that or we revert back to feudalism and people are forced to live like peasants mining minerals in space for Jeff Bezos since algos and automation will have made most middle class jobs obsolete, either or.

No chance market goes down unless tech earnings shits the bed in a spectacular fashion. Why? Cuz we’re above 20 day, 30 day, 50 and 200 day SPY moving averages. And we’re at ATH. There’s no precedent for a violent reversal. Worst case we stay range bound for a while before breaking higher.

I suppose it would but I just don't see it.  TSLA is probably the mega cap with the most competitive pressure coming in some sense.

If they can navigate that well, then I think it makes sense.  But there's still a big amount of time from here to the point where TSLA is making 10+ million cars a year and still has these margins.

When I say little bit, like 1-2 days max, if that.
he keeps buying way OTM short expiry calls and they keep expiring worthless. Remember back before the temp debt ceiling was passed? Back then he had 10/15 450c’s and he was saying the debt ceiling deal would make SPY explode. That didn’t work out. Then he had 10/22 456c and those were up like 400% at one point but he held them until they were worthless, and he kept saying all last week, every night, that a deal would get passed the next day and his calls would print huge. 

Dude seems incapable of learning lessons, he has a bunch of 459c now expiring tomorrow that he bought Friday.

Haha. I def will. I'll post the before and after.
Lol sdc gang. The only gang that never got an actual pump before becoming bag holders.
Idk ive been seeing a lot dudes in here bearish as fuck on spacs and cathie actually trying to make a case for DWAC. Youre like the only bear not drinking the koolaid.

What’s the news?
I’m reallocating my savings, should i put most of it in DWAC or SOFI?
Boredom typically correlates with GME making a bull move soon.
Some of these spac’s see a meme 3 day run, but burn out. I think bottom line getting out at 70 is sell order but try to at least scalp before it drops
I believe that a lot of idiots believe that trumps dumpster fire will be the next Facebook.

Best part about the gloryhole behind Wendy's is you don't know who is on the other side, could be a girl's dick or a guys dick you are sucking.

Getting bored watching GME not go up, probably buy a little more.
Forget work. Get rich with DWAC.
Why would they outlaw toolmaking?
What’s a really light muscle injury referred to as? I’ve got something in my upper back. It’s basically just a throbbing uncomfortability but I can still lift with it. Judging by the intensity it’ll be fully healed in under a week. Anyone know what this type of injury is referred to as?
It's year 2125, SPY is at 4206969.69, an ATH on record volume.  It's been 75 years since a human last placed a trade, however, no one left but the algos now.
I’m Phucked tomorrow
Its strange that a lot of bears are bullish on DWAC? They think companies with actual revenue are fake but think Trumps SPAC is going to be the next facebook.....?
But goldman sachs says were gonna melt up

I personally prefer the beamer but I've never had either. I think consensus says the e46 is a continuously expensive project

Suffering is necessary until you realize it is unnecessary
DWAC probably put us over the top
It’s only 10k, take the hit, sell for a loss. Or hold, but all things 🥭 burn eventually.

My advice, talk to them see what options they give you. As in rates/loans, but Margin calls you answer or leave country.

And 10k isn’t leave the country type debt

Wanna be pinhead for Halloween. Is Hellraiser a good movie?
Agree on Burry but not on Tsla.

Tsla doesn't need to get to 20 million cars to double again.

It has significantly higher profit margins than all other car companies (30%).

FSD is going to add a huge chunk of revenue with extremely high profit margins on top of their normal revenue.

Even at 25 P/E in 2025 with 4.5 - 5 million vehicles sold in 2025, Tsla will be worth over 2k in 2025 (discount down to 1200-1500 for 2022) using just FSD and automobiles.

Whatever happens with energy, insurance, robotaxis or even robots is just gravy on top.

Cathie Wood and Michael Burry are what happens when you double down and triple down on a thing that worked one time.

Obviously they made genius level calls that made tons of money and saw something big early, but like why not give us the next thing instead of something that already happened.

re: Wood, TSLA is already gigantic and valued in a way that already assumes they'll get to 20 million cars produced a year in the next 10 years...  show us a $10-30 billion market cap company that's going to be the next one.  TSLA is not going to double or quadruple again fast.

re: Burry, there's some frothiness in the market... but where else can money go? Stocks are the only place most people (esp wealthy people) can put their money.  This isn't a bubble like 1999 (except maybe some SPA Cs and such that are trading at stupid levels).

You’re depending on the kindness of people. That was great in different times. There are a lot of reasons people have become more self centered and selfish.

So is WSB.  Literally by fucking around.
Here’s an [OTM straddle](http://opcalc.com/Csb) (adjusted for IV crush)- which has a much higher upfront cost than a butterfly. If it moves around 10% you’re looking at a great gain either way, but if it only goes around 5% you’re again, screwed.

Ah okay, the thing with straddles is that they get IV crushed much worse than butterfly spreads- but stand to gain a lot more if it moves. Here’s a [butterfly spread](http://opcalc.com/Csa) that would most likely hit for earnings. The only thing with straddle style plays is that if it doesn’t move enough, you’re completely screwed.

It’s not. This is regular inflation…so far

If you believe that you are retard. Hyperinflation means 100x cost increase there is no way we going there. Twitter ceo is either creating panic or drunk too high
Honestly, the four star general is pretty scary tho. Very intimating
How about restaurants pay waiting staff real wages?

Genital aren’t as bad as people make it out to be either
Whats funny is if you gave me a milli I could for sure turn it into 10mill. If you gave me 100k or less I would for sure lose it all if I didn’t just throw it into SPY.
I’m in for $500 at $90 if it dips I’m dropping 1000

I tip well but those workers shouldn’t have to depend on tips, To Insure Proper Service. How about a good business model instead?
You should pick up 1 long dated call if you have the spare coin. Try it on for size. The company sells a life style and people want to live it, no matter the price. The day they get into cars and eventually if they really crank up the home automatization/optimization element they will be truly one of the safest bets you can make.
Just the tip. Heh.

Your premarket starts early af bro
Yee
It's a good company with millions of users but way overvalued. 33 Billion Mkt Cap with  1.5B of yearly revenue. Anyone with a brain will realize thats way too high of an evaluation.
I bought shares at the IPO and have been holding since.  Don’t like them but they’re making money
Ouch. Got banned from the Astros sub.

They don't seem to like it when people bring up the 2017 season.
Will have to see price action tomorrow
Definitely buy and hold.
My calls not liking this premarket so far
Nope. And more for the rest of us

Better sell those puts at open.
Lets go DWAC!
Some of the other tech earnings have resulted in the stock basically being flat. Idk it’s not really outside the realm of possibility. 

I’m thinking AMZN is going to provide some good Q4 guidance. Maybe some mention of a stock split. If so green af

This is my optimistic scenario as a debit spread holder at least

TSLA $1,000 by EOW
Yes sirrrr
what is that assumption though? "assuming it operates normally" is baked with like 10,000,000 assumptions
I’m just biden my time
Same.   What u like as far as strike?
Zero. They get paid a full wage.

Edit: Keep tipping those full wage employees you cucks lol.
If I had the means I’d follow you. I’m all tied up holding a few 152cc exp in feb ‘22, i still regret not staying liquid enough for that DWAC madness
I honestly can't tell if you're serious or satire but mad respect bro 🙏

Big agree. My plan is to straight up help my kid buy a place. He’ll pay mortgage and everything but DAMN is renting expensive. That way he pays less every month and makes a few hundo every month in the long run.

It’s honestly wild how much having money can help you make money.

Edit: I definitely realized this sounds like a douchey humblebrag. I’m not rich, don’t have kids and won’t have one for at least another 2-3 years and I’m literally just assuming that my WISH bet pays off one day.
Why futs so down
I used to move and I’d be very happy with that
I’d say not at all. Sounds about right/even on the generous side depending on where you live

Sorry mom I have bigger dreams than becoming a lawyer, there’s shitposting on reddit that needs to be done
So satisfying when a SPY 0DTE call play works out
I didn’t buy deep otm spreads but I’m basically doing this with some call spreads at the moment for Feb 2022.

My gut is they gave a low guidance as Q3 is historically their worst quarter and they are about to obliterate earnings/revenue. Typically AMZN dips from earnings. This time I think it’s flat or green. I bet they go on a nice green run from here till Xmas
All the non 🌈s left this sub only dd is dwac since
Yes. Options open up for business. Ride the wave

I don't directly own any Apple stock, but they're an amazing company. Tim Cook planned out their semiconductor supply chain such that they're cranking out beastly new chips when everyone else is struggling just to get two year old chips. Plus, their products are built to fail on cue. My Macbook Pro keyboard broke the day before they announced the new one.
michael: how did you know it was me?

poop: micheal.
Yes
So I know this is the weekend thread but I have a bit of an arcane finance question and the only people who might know the answer are my genius brothers here at wallstreetbets. So people always talk about the Greeks in relation to options pricing, and they're great, sure, they're a great rule of thumb, but at the end of the day, the Greeks don't *determine* options pricing, you know? Like, at the end of the day, the only thing that truly *determines* options pricing is the bid-ask (and you can test this yourself by going into an illiquid strike/underlying and fucking the mark price all around by putting in an "odd" bid/ask, right?). So my question is, who is "enforcing" the Greeks? Random market market algorithms? Because like any other spot price the market equilibrium is where the bid and ask meet to clear the market, period. I mean I guess at the end of the day things like Delta and theta are mathematically deductible, like no one is (typically) going to offer less than intrinsic value for an option and so those options prices should track with those Greeks pretty consistently but like for example with Vega, who is "enforcing" how volatility affects options pricing? Just random algos? Idk just musing...

Yes the puts start heavily outweighing calls around 451. Thats (tentatively) where the pivot will be, won't know for certain till we see tomorrow's options data. Puts for the ride down to 451, then 453c back up
If it does, just buy the fucking dip!

But it's unlikely to happen. Diseases tend to evolve to be more contagious and less deadly.
Please learn more about the SPAC process before you YOLO into DWAC at these levels. This is far from done deal, and you are dealing with Mango. He will likely IPO or seek another SPAC with a bigger trust given the mooning.

You’re asking poors,how to not be poor?
Do not. The original was awful
Some people will shit on YouTube if you reference it. I think it is the greatest thing tbh.
People who are not poor
When the economy is good, demand for oil to make and ship things goes up. When the economy is bad, demand for oil to make and ship things goes down. When the supply of oil is high the price goes down. When the supply of oil is low, the price goes up.

Because of COVID, oil companies thought oil demand would be low, so they stopped producing as much oil (remember when there were negative prices for oil? Companies were literally paying people to take the barrels of oil off their hands so they didn't have to pay for storage.) So now the supply of oil is low. But weirdly enough, the demand came back really fast. Humans discovered the cure to the disease in like a year. So now the supply is low which causes high prices, and the demand is high, which also causes high prices. Once the supply of oil increases to match, things will be fine though. This is what JPow and Yellen mean when they say inflation is transitory and caused by short term supply bottlenecks. This is one of those bottlenecks. But in the meantime oil is expensive and everything else in the economy is slowed down because of it.

Also, green energy is pretty cheap nowadays so oil is becoming less important. But all energy supply is low relative to demand now, so all energy is going up in price including oil, natural gas, coal, solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, etc. Plus, there's nowhere to store green energy (like a giant battery). It has to produced, transferred at the speed of light, and used immediately. Oil can be stored in barrels or the ground though so it's more convenient and works overnight when the sun is down (even though it's more expensive to ship).

Oil is inflation. They force rate up.

What do ships use to move stuff from China to destination countries?
What do truckers use to move your goods from a port of origin to local warehouses? 
What do workers use to build buildings and roads?
What do workers use to get to work?

Oil up, costs up, profits down. But oil companies profit. It’s a see saw.
How fast are you selling those?
Geez you are a special kind of stupid. Oil goes up and gas becomes more expensive. This puts less
Money in business and consumer pockets. Business that use gas, oil, almost any petroleum based chemical then pass on increase to consumers. Yet again, less money in pockets so less buying if everything else.

I think DWAC is the first huge stock we’ve had some GME

CLOV, wish, etc. were around since before GME and that’s all we’ve had since then. We haven’t had a really strong rallying cry like GME or before that, TSLA, SPCE, and others

Sorry for ruining your precious karma? Not sure a internationally released film should be esoteric. I’d imagine the goal of a film adaption would be to use it as a opportunity to simplify the plot of the novel to its essential components, and build on it cinematically instead of haphazardly trying to include all the nuance and create something ultimately ineligible

I'm not sure how up to date you are on the whole GameStop situation but Amazon is heading for bankruptcy and GameStop is now their biggest competitor. market cap isn’t there yet, but the company plan is on track.

Also Jeff Bezos is the target of every major corporation now. Amazon CANT survive the next few years with their increasing bad reputation from littering and burning unused inventory to labor rights with their workers being violated.

Amazon sounds great, until you look underneath the hood and see all the parts are grinding and screaming.

GameStop is targeting Amazon to be the epicenter of e-commerce/gaming. This GameStop earnings has been MASSIVELY anticipated and i believe Amazon will continue to develop a negative correlation to GameStop. So what do they have to do with each other? competitors and GameStops about to make the move with a bite to the jugular.

None of the above. I kinda wonder if I got [a bad onion](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salmonella-onions-imported-mexico-cdc/).
So SPY, which consists of the top 500 companies in America, is worth $439. GME is worth $190. So that means GME is worth a little less than half of the value of the top 500 companies combined. This doesn’t account for the dark pool craptoe lots that suppress the true price of GME, nor does it account for the fact that Ryan Cohen will turn this company into the next Amazon. So tell me how GameStop is “going out of business” when it’s worth nearly half of the value of the top 500 companies COMBINED?

Mango 🥭 is locked in with 80 million customers after it launches.  The 🥭 movement has brought down all other social media where 🥭 was going to be present.  This is different.  Oh, and this enrollment and customer base is real not fake tallies.

You have a chance for the market to close at even. Probably the same chance as Alec Baldwins career making a comeback.
Plz God let these 451p hit bank tomorrow. Felt dumb buying them but they were so cheap I couldn't resist the temptation. Is it a sin? I don't think so, Jesus take the wheeeel!

I don't believe Jesus wanted any of these organized churches or power structures. Now so many people profit and abuse in his name. People think Christianity is fading but it comes in waves so tall they last a  whole generation. The kids I work with are so existentially scared because their woke parents won't even give them a hint at the possibility of the divine.

Jesus wanted us to love everyone, especially our enemies, and give people everything they need if we have it.

Here’s why day traders add to the stock price, they don’t just pump and dump. And why having a ton of day traders is great for your stock 

So let’s say day traders all together on a stock buy 1,000,000 shares. Then let’s say they have an average hold time of 50% of active market hours

That means that 500,000 shares are permanently being locked up by day traders 

If a stock is poised to become a day trader heaven stock, then that alone acts as a bullish catalyst that will push it up
SPY $420 or $460 by EOW?

I really dislike the way people give the mods shit about how we handled some ticker or other. It's such a fucking lame part of the wsb package.

People throw all of this manipulative "bro I totally loved you before this one thing, but now I think you're a shill" stuff at you. reeeeeee. Then you're the asshole if you don't run around giving a shit about their misconception.
This actually makes sense.... BAN
His gun? Must have been very smol
I spent the last 3 weeks away from WSB and in that time my port has gone up 8%  by parking most of my capital in F and various ETFs and 2 swing trades on the AMD run up. SO  anyway Whatd I miss?

Renting an apartment at 18 is the dumbest thing you can do. Not sure why we as a culture made that normal. In most of the world it's not normal at all. 

Probably because it used to be more realistic to be able to buy a house young. Idk, but it's not smart in 2021.

DAAC is really cheap.
Now that I’m buying a house, I’m thinking to myself. Why *wouldn’t* I let my kid (that I don’t have yet) live in the basement. It seems silly to kick them out at 18.

Sure, living in your parents basement isn’t a very good look, but neither is living in an apartment tbh. I’d like to raise a strong son who can buy a home, but you can’t just pretend your some proud parent because your kid rents a 1 bedroom slum

50% prog, 50% sdc, 100% gme, gamble the rest away
Need high inflation. Watch my wheat futures moon and pay off my house faster.
Mango stock 200.  U have been eliminated.
I became a millionaire last year, invested it all in a startup. Will either go broke, or make $100m plus. Currently it’s a coin flip, but hoping I don’t remain on ramen
Market cap is still nothing.  The blackout is obvious
Fook m8. My bad bro
Futures redder than u/vacationlover1’s face during a love scene
Here’s what I’m thinking:

FB will drop a few percent on earnings, the name change will become a meme so going all in on calls at open on Tuesday afterIV crush
Seems to be plenty of support above that
I got a bad disease

Up from my brain is where I bleed

Insanity it seems
Dude fuck you goosebumps was the best kids show ever
Its funny when you click the dd post and the way it’s sorted shows old DD that never panned out. Like CRSR from 17d ago. Its good for a laugh
Picked up 100 on Friday I'll double down tomorrow
Bs.  Look at gme or amc.  The volume stayed up.  DWAC isnot going viral.  It’s being stuffed out by all forms of media except WSB.
5.5% inflation is adorable. It assumes one is really living under a rock.
It always comes back down to 9.25

Show me on this 🐻 where they touched you
Is he wearing your panties on his head?
bill hwang has already successfully cosplayed sang woo
Kayleigh is so hot
Does Alec Baldwin feel the same way as a guy who gets a girl pregnant while wearing a condom?
Behind every successful ATH is a bull doubting his own mind. Usually works out fine though.
Volume on DWAC came down hard on Friday compared to Thursday.  It’s shocking the blackout it is getting from media.  I would get rid of those bags as soon as you have a chance

It might shock you to learn that taxing the ultra wealthy in order to lift people out of desperate poverty so they have money to buy things actually helps the economy more than letting ultra rich get richer and the poor languish.

As far as form goes leave your ego at the door. The guy squatting 200 and using proper form is winning more than the guy who is the same size and strength who is doing 300 with shit form. You should not be exhausted during hypertrophic training after just a few sets, you get more gains from controlling moderate weight very well than struggling with heavy weight. Trying to lift heavy is for powerlifting/strength training. If you want gains keep with the 8-12 rep regiments per set

Whatever gives me the lowest potential loss.   I look at the cost of the puts vs the payout.   I do try to go kinda high on the strike price, so theres a higher chance they'll stay in the money and after eventually selling my shares, I can resell or reuse the puts.

What I'm (trying) to do is effectively use it as a super stop loss so once it's in place I now have a maximum potential loss on the trade, regardless of what happens overnight or whatever.    

I've been buying them several months out too.   As long as they're in place I can swing shares left and right and don't have to worry about it too much.   Each time the price swings back and forth I can take a profit, unless it swings too far in one direction, then it's time to cash out.    That's assuming the price DOES swing wildly but I'm specifically targeting meme stonks for this sort of thing.
It just IPOd it’s not available tomorrow.

Yeah, but that’s my point. The boomers didn’t have it hard, the generation before them did. That generation, my grandfather among them, worked their asses off to make the country better. The boomers just took advantage of all that hard work and told the next generation to fuck off while they got theirs. I’ve managed to buy a house and make a decent living, but I’m not planning on having kids at this point because I can’t afford to have a decent living and have kids.

Honestly DIDI 2024 leaps are a legit decent gamble. 95% chance that the expected happens and the drama passes and they keep killing it as a company and those leaps absolutely print like mad since didi is worth as of today in the 20-30 a share range easily, by 2024 should be approaching 100. 5% chance that they get fucked with again or some BS. I’ll take those odds honestly, 3 years for a company to go up to what it’s worth is a good bet to me. One tiny smidgen of a word of good news and it’s going up 100% the next day.

Not that impressive doesn’t go as far as you’d think
That's what is so crazy. Despite using that much federal money, they still pay more than they take.
Can’t wait for options on this bish
That’s alright your mom can handle the door
We looking at the same thing?
I appreciate the hype in this thread. The weekend guys were real downers.
A 150 strike for November is the plan.
What’s up with every recipe asking for like 1/4 of a tsp of a spice. Unless that spice is heroin I’m gonna go ahead and quadruple it because no one is going to taste 1/4 tsp of anything

eat my ball, bet u like watching kids with lupus suffer you filthy satanist
With options being available tomorrow I could see it spiking again. The initial drop was people taking profits. Those of us who are in it for the long haul will be putting enough money into it to significantly move it if there isn’t any intervention from the feds or something like that. Just my opinion though.

Whats mentally wrong with people who put stickers on their car?

It's hilarious that wackos keep pushing this idea. It's like pointing out California's problems make it easier to ignore the problems in their own states, and in some twisted mental gymnastics makes it easier to take all that free money California keeps giving the degenerate red states.

Looks like FB calls is the play tomorrow. What strike?
It’s the whole point of this topic dumbass
I get so angry when I think about satan creating Lupus Nephritis. Those poor patients have suffered for too long. I literally start shaking and crying and vomiting while shitting myself out of anger. It makes me question God and why he would allow the devil to create such a terrible disease. But then I remember there is a man. A man named Peter Greenleaf. Some of you may know him as Penis Weed. The name is irrelevant. You may even call him god if you like. Because he is the CEO of a company performing modern miracles. Thank Penis Weed for steering AUPH to the successful commercialization of Lupkynis and making the lives of Lupus Nephritis patients infinitely better. Lupkynis is a miracle drug sent by the miracle man Penis Weed. I have invested my life savings on margin into his company and once they get bought out by big pharma I plan to donate at least 69 million to the lupus foundation

Just get a medical ID?
I’ll be buying them from you! Good luck.
Long on medical equipment, real estate brokers, financial advisors, casket builders
Weed being legal good DD! Weed is legal in all kinds of places way better than California!
Exactly - and we’re in a market fueled by stupidity and memes, if the majority of people had their heads in the sand on Thursday and Friday it could get interesting - with a big rip upward - but I think we’re looking at a fast decline as people realize the joke ended at $175. This market is all about being the first person in on the joke haha

$DWAC puts will pay .. eventually
Hyperinflation giving you limp dick?  Consider investing in Coinbase.  If the popular coin does protect against "hyperinflation" than Coinbase will do well.  If popular coin proves to be meritless, Coinbase still offers upside through transaction fees, services, and custodianship of the alternative code coins.  $COIN is a boner waiting to happen.

GOOOOD FUCKINNNN EVENING GOD DAMMIT
I think fed is waiting for boomers to die so economy is healthy again
Buy and hold BROS if you can get it in the low 50s (will likely dip back down there in the coming weeks, maybe sell a put or two).  If you’re looking to flip shares or options, I’d say COIN puts a few mo the out, round lots of APPL, TQQQ, WMT, HOOD (I know, it’s the worst but Itll be in the mid 40s again soon), etc. good luck.
Lol don’t let that stop you. I’ve done it. You’ll have to be able to explain why you’re leaving so soon to the new employer which can get touchy, but it’s definitely possible.
cant name it here as its a penny stonk..but that company went from $1 to $20  last week and is down to $6.6ish as of friday market close. rhymes with fun
And despite weed being legal, the illegal market is thriving because they taxed and regulated it to death. California will take a good concept destroy it and ask for more of your money

Already got my feet wet Thursday and emptied it Friday nice profit but wanna wait until Wednesday to actually see how the options gonna go and the price action with it not having that many shares

You think it’s got more room to run this week?

He’s not a bear? Lol 

Bro you do you. He’s basically saying he’s not seeing any value In the market as a whole, it’s imploding at some point soon, and he’ll be there to pick up the pieces afterwards. 

He has billions more than you and me, I’m sure he’s a moron though. 🙄
BUY AT MARKET

How on sale is Goog right now, they're looking thicc, I feel like they bled from the general tech dip this week.
I bought a bunch of different strikes and expiry’s, but my longest dated expiry is $70c 1/21/22

Ppl are too dumb to upvote you.
I agree to pay taxes, its the deal we struck a while back.

I just don’t agree what we pay taxes on or for, or how. But that’s bullshit politics and a no no here.

So that said, 🥭 puts
Are those your only options 🤣
Hoping for a rebound day with BNTX tomorrow

You have a “fonder” imagination of them.

I envision them as some faceless creation from author H.P Lovecraft, void of emotion and feeling, only to gain a sense of life as it drains it from others watching Theta slowly fuck bulls. But not to much or they would die and then the abhorrent creature wouldn’t eat again.
They could take the Eduardo Saverin route, give up citizenship and retain additional hundreds of millions moving to various locales with capital friendly policy.
Yessir 🤑
Could always just dump it all in the street for an entertaining afternoon.
Jagex came out with a new game?
For the sellers
It was already down 6% Friday on a random spook from what happened to Snapchat. I’m not bullish but I’m selling puts because you’re retarded if you think FB is going to drop another 6% just because Snapchat is the worst company on the planet
&gt; The options were 5 days or 2 weeks. The bot is currently set to 20 days for testing purposes.
pumpernickel? i hardly know hernickel.
I’m kinda with him on that the US government sucks so fucking bad I almost would rather give all my money to charity than support these cocksucker politicians
Why 20 days? I thought the options were 5 days or 2 weeks
Cock pussy hoe
Disagree. Having your money tied up in a bad investment for 9 months isn't really a better look.
snap calls printing tomorrow ?

Lucid motors or QuantumScape?
I mean taxes as a whole are unconstitutional but here we are
IV is still up the tits
No lol that’s retarded.
I feel ya. I heard so many perishable were rotting away because they left them out in the heat and didn't deliver.
If you’re serious, you need some serious education
I mean, everyone here said the mango stock was going to tank Friday morning after it ran up 300% Thursday and me yoloing into that at Thursday close turned out pretty fucking ok.

I leaned today that muslims can have alcohol as long as it’s not used for the purposes of intoxication (unlike the pork restriction). The more you know. 🌈

Blow?  LOL what is this 1982?
Auto fill is the way to go
Thank you. I appreciate it, just feeling low as of now. I guess I have time on my side
All I’m going to say is, we all know volatility here. Do we really want big gov’t to determine unrealized gains are taxable? What if the next day those “unrealized” gains turn into dust cause market crash or volatility?
&gt; The gains were huge.
Donaldinho Pumpernickel
Oof I felt the same but got bored and sold a few days before the huge breakout. How were the gains?
Agree, fuck Lupus.
That’s just idiotic to me, out of 500 companies in the SP there’s not one he thinks is a bargain. That’s why people hate bears.
MCD should benefit from reduced labor costs, the issue will be revenue / eps, and growth potential 

I don't which direction it'll trend
Anyone bullish on FB?
$20 call on sofi to $21
No no no, were not talking about hot bathrooms here. This dude is presumably at a house or apartment that is a comfortable temp and got sweaty taking a shit because he strained himself. I’ve taken some monster shits in my time, but if you’re pushing that hard you may need to start taking some fiber or something before you give yourself hemorrhoids. JFC
Any DOCN holders?
What’s you business? I’m doing property management and construction!
Scalp, day trade, swings. No options
At worst your set up for heat for a while

Hell yes. Corporate slave job ain’t too bad. Got 100K selling cash puts to bears. Weekly income. 1K-2K a week from premiums. Cash secured puts!!! Good luck! Seriously tho. Apply fuckin everywhere . My gpa was ass compared to yours (3.2)
Get the shot
I can already feel the electricity of this trading week, it’s sparkling like billions of diamonds in my brain, translucent and shimmering with bull semen
🤤
I just want someone to answer me what they’ll do in return. Go cash with hyperinflation? Nah. Move it somewhere else, like what? They’ll suck it up and remain in the us market because TINA
He doesn’t like anything right now. 

I know he’s a gay stupid moron bear but that’s his exact words 

Good luck to everyone if he feels like that.

AUPH TO THE MOON
Time to lose your DWAC gains tomorrow or are you looking for more gains
PSFE, BB, RKLB, DKNG
Why even bother with spreads pussy SPY only goes up
Pretty much. 22 is insanely young I'm jelly
Bulls, don't even bother coming to the market tomorrow.
I would pay 100 less than that for DWAC as a speculative day trade. so, fucked
$wish and $GME calls tomorrow
Are you joking? Take the loan to reduce the total price then immediately refinance with your credit union for 5 or less
I’m drinking it alll brotha, the flavor alone is enough , anything extra is a bonus. Chew on the flower stuff in my warm ass tea. Try it and then tell me about your creamer when all you want is flavor.
 Large call sweeps have been coming in for weeks
Zucky has announcements on Wednesday.
Probably BB settlement, new name , new options etc
Only the fact that it will fill the gap at 75… I’m playing it to that only. long term I think it’ll do well. Snaps not going anywhere.
I'm just starting. Could use some help
Ah but he’s still in. Got ya. Even he knows he’s not getting returns nowhere else
[deleted]
that's what I'm getting at. if it's just weed gtfo the prohibition states and come get a paycheck and freedom out west. if it's for something more illicit prob still have more luck out here but really should be looking into methods of getting it off your record
Should have taken your shirt off first. Rookie mistake tbh
The bloodbath will be glorious like the opening scene from Blade 1
Any play here (besides SPY calls) that gets a bunch of upvotes is doomed.

Any play that gets a bunch of downvotes is a bad attempt at a pump and dump, and therefore doomed.

And any play that gets mostly ignored will probably make money.
So many big dick earnings releases this week.
Seemed to like the 90’s
Only bubble popping this week is my cum bubbles
You know that scene in the dark knight rises where the Alfed tells bruce that some men just wanna watch the world burn?


That's how I imagine theta Gang. Manically laughing, feverishly rubbing their hands together; not at the prospect of increasing their money hoard, but knowing that when the call they sold expires just barely OTM, somewhere there is a miserable bull distraught that they gave up the premium for no Goddamn reason. "Lighting money on fire" as WSB used to say.
Thanks man, how’d it work out for you? Are you in a better position now?
Got 350 gallons of oil on Friday in anticipation of price rise, let’s hope I made the right play for once

Fuck the poors, they will always complain
TECH bubble popping this week
TSLA 🚀🚀🚀
You're 22 with a stable full time job. You're fine. The reason you don't feel that way is that you're too young to actually realise how long your time horizon is.

You made my day. Thank you ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

You playing ford at all? Up ~15pct in 2 weeks. Not sure they can roll out their corolla sized pickup profitably with chip shortage and materials cost on the rise.
And stick it where? Where are they gonna get returns like in the u.s. market

"intensive background check"? i.e. you have a conviction for possession of something probably stronger than weed?
OH FUCK! BRB
Way before that
Leetcode grind and apply everywhere
My advice is since you are in such a state take it easy on the stock market. Don't get too risky and reckless. I assume your mental fortitude is pretty low. Take it easy and hope things get better for you.

Yeah they can bitch and moan but they’ll do nothing and eat the tax bill bc like Ryan Gosling said in The Big Short “but you’re not care Vinny bc you’re gonna be making so much fucking money”
I may just yeet my entire portfolio in SPY debit spreads. If everyone thinks the world is gonna come crashing down in a few months, that means it’s priced in and stocks will just keep going up.
The TWTR one I don’t agree with. AAPL hasn’t kept me from seeing any ad TWTR is putting out. I think Jack will surprise 😎
Lol wtf. Who gets sweaty taking a shit?
THC binds to fat, isn’t water soluble so unless you had cream or some form of fat you definitely belong here
Is there any avenue for self employment in your field? If your gonna bet on anyone why not yourself?
All reasons I'm bullish
They have no where else to put their billions. Offshore banks are also risky. Offshore accounts are don't have the decent protections and can be easily hacked. Property is already too damn high and too late to invest in anymore.
LOL WTF . I thought it was something important
Not worth the headache man trust me, just got done with a few.

22 years old. graduated with a computer science degree from a state university with a 3.9 GPA in May of this year. Work a dead end, complete brain dead IT job with no room for growth or learning.

Just received word last week that my $80k/yr signed job offer was rescinded because I failed an intensive background check for doing some drugs in college. This was after i told family and friends that i got this job and put my two weeks’ notice in at work. Feel like the only reason I even received an offer for this position was because of an internal refferal from a friend. 

Any advice? I feel like I’m 10 steps behind at this point and never going to amount to anything. Never been this down bad in my life and I’m consumed with regret and disappointment. 

Also doesn’t help that most of my stock plays are lagging the s&amp;p 🤡
I wonder if the stupid articles surrounding investing/stock market on big websites are intentionally bad or just incompetent.

Don't know which is worse either
I always remember that commercial “verb, it’s what you do!”
Thank you for the gold and starry kind strangers
With you on that but this may be a very volatile stock. Yolo
If I were to sell calls, they would have a very specific criteria, firstly covered. Secondly wildly impractical and IV is outlandish. But those are the calls I buy. Because I don’t do big gambles anymore. Just “lottos”.

I would think theta gang does it for, a passive income on people like me.
we know peter schiff would
Well, who’s fault is that, retard?

No, stay away from it

Taxing billionaires unrealized gains… billionaires act like all of a sudden they’re gonna take their money out of the market and entrust it to Winnie The Pooh and Gyna instead. Please. With the stock market continuing to go up the way it is, it’ll barely be a blip on their fortune.

Semiconductor companies w/ chip shortages since early this year, it doesnt look like it has gotten any better, most car parts are in backorders and ps5 is still not widely available on the market, puts on amd 

Bullish on amzn earnings, bearish on mcd due to labor shortage 

Finally, bearish on twitter due to apple privacy laws

Ask yourself how many stocks continue enriching people after a 1300% gain, no product, and already 30 days from a cease and desist lawsuit?

Nah man, we all know everyone poops but if you’re just dating her nobody wants to hear or smell all that. Immediate turn off.
It’s not weird, you’ve been trained into doing things for others your whole life. Look at you doing it now.

Your kids will to.
Depends on how much money you have. I sell CCs on meme stocks as they show up. I sell weeklies till sentiment dies. Then it’s off to the next one. At worst I break even on the purchase and collect the premiums. At best I make 10-20% on the stock plus premiums. As the guy below said, sell  at a strike higher than your purchase price and you’re golden.
Lambo is flashy and retards think it will help them get laid. I am one of these retards.
I use Snap everyday, no idea they even had ads…. Can’t see how they turn a profit
Just be honest man. Go let it hang, if it's loud then apologize. If she's REALLY into you she won't care. If she's that shallow then she isn't worth holding onto anyways, just saying.
Honestly don’t understand why anyone wouldn’t buy AUPH
I want to bang roosters!
Ad rev is way down. Work in an unrelated tech company, and the mobile games have had a lot less ad revenue as some of our buyers are running into supply chain chokes that are reducing their 3rd quarter estimates. The ad revenue hit should be seen as warning sign.

With shipping going the way it has been, LCID's going to run out of chips before they hit 2021 production targets pre-SPAC, let alone the reduced projections they announced after they had everyone's money.
[deleted]
If you want to BUY puts they better be in the money. OTM will be risky with the premium. This thing moved 1500% in two days. IV is infinite.
Fb earnings tomorrow will give us insights
16.23 here, 2/3 of it left
so If I buy call and put options I should profit either way........maybe.
Gonna need some apes in that flair
Tell her you’re gonna go to the gas station or corner store to get something.
step 1 LCID buy, 

step 2 hold till production starts to fill orders, sell before inevitable problems after six months, 

step 3  Profit.
Selling puts on tsm and amd. Either I get premium or good companies at a discount. Thots?
also I can't wait to watch DWAC either castrate or enrich an entire swath of people, gonna be a fun start to the week
Got a break it in somehow
Hold
Insiders just wanted to load up
Wrong. They only go right
BB......no wait....CLOV....ahhh..  no wait .......I meant TLRY...yea that's it TLRY.
onboard with the FB calls sentiment.  RIP snapchat RIP whistleblowers, Zuck made a pact with the devil
**DWAC bag holders $175 don’t worry we’ll be there for you tm 🥭❤️**
I want to see their accounts
The back of the club sipping Moët is where you’ll find me
But the premiums will be too high. When I said deep OTM, I meant DEEP. Like 50% of current price at a maximum. Even that will be risky. I think net asset value ($10) puts or near it will be worth playing. So minus 75-85% from current price.
Let’s get it going already!
Alcoholics are allowed, the problem is they don't allow anyone who smokes weed
Is her boyfriend there ?
Every time someone uses a ticker as a verb, I buy puts on it. Hasn't failed me yet.
finding that if I don't hold anything, go into trending stocks or spy options only, absolutely don't hold a single share or contract for longer than feels right, sell before i screenshot, and rinse/repeat this is a pretty solid market to trade in
Imagine only investing in one direction when stocks go 2 directions
Hopefully there’s a dip so I can get the fuck out of my 82  0 dte 444 spy puts
Too bad i don't know how to short the turkish lira
It's going to 500 that's only a 15 bil market cap, GME reached 50 bil which would put Mango at 1500.

You have a very specific subset of scenarios that follow this theory
$FB calls maybe… who knows
Facebook going to show it was just a Snapchat issue and bust a nut all over those puts.

I would have bought shares ! 

I’m trying to save some poor kid from getting gapped tomorrow 

DO NOT FOMO

You missed it DWAC imploding soon
There’s no schedule to the stock market
It’s ok. Your not alone. There are other bag holders out there. I am a Ocugen bag holder and I’m fine with it. Everything will work out

$DWAC. 
LOADING UP!
you been heavy against DWAC I’d love to see your put position on Monday, and loss porn shortly after
Watching DWAC from the sidelines. This week should be fun.

Good luck to the smooth brains playing either direction, may the tendies be with you
Why are futures contracts so damn expensive. Its like 1 contract of oil is 1000 barrels. Maybe I only want to by 10 barrels worth. Wtf

There’s nothing in my life rn except praying GOOG stays above 2655 by the end of the week

When are options available on mango?
Mango mania for sure. Gonna be yuge!!!
Science!
Thanks metoo, now I have to watch fat middle aged men and 11 year olds during nba timesouts instead of hot 19 year old bitches with big tits
Good riddance.

If we just sink all the cargo ships outside of the ports, it would technically get rid of the backlog 🧐
Cars drive themselves. Fake news.
Chain is built out 35-150. Should be live tomorrow.
I hope. I FOMO
Where the DWAC $170+ long-term investors at?
GME bag holders looking pretty good in comparison

Show me your futures. I’m way over leveraged
Ban
You’re going to be fine. 

&gt;!Dibs on this guy’s organs once the vultures are finished with him.!&lt;
Just sell deep OTM puts as soon as they open. I heard it's tomorrow, but that seems absurd.
Why
[deleted]
What should I go all in on tomorrow
No alcoholics is the problem
Sometimes I feel like I’m the only smart one in this sub…and a few handful of folks I hand picked
Would you pay $170 for DWAC?
I'm not in it, but I think it will be a roller coaster. Time it right to drop those bags.
Lol
I already told you. Socialism = sucks. Clearly I know what it is
[deleted]
Tell me you don’t know what socialism is by saying you have to be socialist to have a library.

Won't the warrants transfer into shares?
Asking for a friend.....how fuked are DWAC $170+ bagholders 😞?
Facebook calls is the way
Well, actually, that's none of your business, Christie.
Is this a real thing?

Anyone have any good Alec Baldwin memes?
Is this a list of trash stocks?
Average down pussy this shits mooning hard. 175 was not the top
Taking home premium + selling above your cost basis isn't an L
When are DWAC options live? I’m no MAGA guy or anything but calls are gonna print when he announces he’s running in 2024
Yes. Socialism sucks
I’m anti-work. As in I sell weed. And would rather not work.

I also cycle 5-10 miles every other day, goto the gym 4 times a week, just repainted my house myself, tore out my carpet last week and staining my hardwood stairs.

I wouldn’t say I’m lazy. I just don’t believe in a system where labor is supplied with a currency that is no longer backed by the gold standard.

You are a fool in my book if you think a 9 to 5 is acceptable and do it.
I’m going to make moves with all the mommies
SPAC settle back at $20 

Good luck 🍀
Only 30 mil shares. 120 mil Trumpers. 1/4th of them buy 1 share than the floats locked. 

I don't even like Trump and I have 100 shares

600 mil volume in 2 days. I think we have the float locked already but brokers haven't delivered all our shares just like with GME. 

Took GME 2 weeks to peak, I think we hold we win once all those ftds come due.

If you're bearish just sell calls, rake in crazy high premium. If it hits you win still, if she dips, buy another 100 shares and sell more calls.

Literally can't lose if you don't panick and be a pussy
That’s why you’ll always be poor
Jets are the  worst team  in the entire league. Pats fans are delusional this will be there 3rd win two against the JETS lol.

Trading in the ‘96 Civic for a ‘98 Civic?
No portfolio is complete without some McDonalds
Yeah, I'm done being around people
Hopefully it was just snap having a dumb platform that their ad revenue wasn’t great. If fb and goog also are experiencing lower ad spending then tech overall won’t be rallying
Your mom is a troll
you only pay taxes on YTD gains not total cost of options
im strong anti-work. thats why i trade for money
This is tempting
It means the underlying is probably a bit above the ATM strike
im praying amd hits 130 on earnings. daddy needs a new car
Donnie is literally the most UNPREDICTABLE person of all time. He could totally change his mind on the deal and it goes back to $10 or he could start pumping it to all his followers saying it'll be the biggest stock of all time and it'll go to $300+
Yeah what’s up with that, like it’s recommended everyday for me and I’m employed and shit lol
How about them taxes ?
I like baba, could be a real cash cow as long as China doesn’t fuck it up again.  So beat down
Anti-work and socialist are the same lazy mindset and they are found in abundance on Reddit.
Anybidy trade wheat or soybeans?
Troll
I YOLOed DWAC at 110$. im freaking out. any chance trump talk about it soon?
Why? Any news?

Jack ma is traveling again.
Love all the fake anti-work posts that make the front page now:

Boss: “I’m gonna need you to work overtime tonight. And I’m also gonna need your wife to come over for a gangbang. Muahaha I’m a big bad boss.”

Employee: “You know what, that’s the last straw, I quit!”

67 trillion upvotes by unemployed people.
For sure you are. It’s at $85 billion dollar valuation. They hardly maintain $1 bill of revenue per quarter. Also I don’t see them doubling their revenue any time soon
Spam, ban
SPY calls after mondays dip
For earnings if the calls are more expensive than the puts at the ATM strike then does that mean the expectation is the stock will go up after releasing the report?
under 1m
DWAC
And if fb earnings are good snap will really print.
[deleted]
If that was true I’d buy the fuck out of it
OCGN.  That is all.  Just watch!
Please don’t spam the fucking ticker till there’s more people on board, and have some dd. That shit turns people off they want to know why? Other than just pumping it
[A lot of calls were bought on Friday](https://twitter.com/MandoTrading/status/1451956590152585219)

I have been practicing social distancing my entire life.  I love having my space.  Been to concerts and sports stadiums but not for a while now .
Win or lose it still won't make my cock bigger
I’m a buyer at .50
I'm still not convinced Jack is alive on Twitter his last post is October 2020. The only time we saw him was that deep fake video
Pats running up the score on the Jets. Hope they keep throwing.
Bagholder spotted.

You’re a fucking retard
TSLA $1000 EOW
What are stocks people are selling covered calls on right now? Would BB and Wish be good ones to sell cc on?
Hope to god MSFT spikes, then use the gains from that to grab deep OTM AMZN calls.

It’s pricing in the possibility of a bad earnings, which we all know is impossible. Time to make bank.

Started this year with an options day trading account of 100k. So far YTD spent $1,986,993.95 on options. Not saying I'm up that much just that's just my total cost of options this year. Lots of gains and lots of losses.

Bought one UVXY call for tomorrow.
Sorry burrytards but $800 is now the floor ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
The secret has been staying very liquid and simple and not trying to do fancy stuff like options or long holds.  Not trying to guess what will go up and just focusing on 2 indexes, SPY and QQQ
Thanks honey
PENCILS DOWN RETARDS

JESUS that volume

How did you enable your flair? Doesn't let me on mobile
BB going green on a red day is the most insanely stupid shit ever. I love this stock. 10 here we come. God Bless üá®üá¶
If you just keep transferring money into your brokerage account, at face value, you‚Äôre always green.
PENCILS DOWN
This bear candle daily kinda weak atm. 

It needs to be redder, larger, faster, stronger...

Dump it! Chowdaa!!!!
1,000$ on 10/13 430P  üçª. Alr have a banbet
Very natural price action there SPY .. very natural indeed
PAMP EET. JPOW CRYING TRYING TO GET IT TO GO UP UP U P
Bruh Tesla is undefeated
What in the cousin fucking v shape ending
#PENCILS DOWN RETARDANTS
Did somebody say big bags!? I‚Äôve got some over here!!
‚ÄúSoon‚Äù 

-Chuck Schumer
Nice little dick punch at the end.
What 2 stick pp in?
Seeing stuff like SOFI is actually what makes my dick hard. Bulls vs Bears in their natural habitat. God speed, retards.
It's definitely "off". Higher relative volume for SPY, or UVXY?
#AHHHHH JUST DO SOMETHING FUCK
Bro SPY is literally down .15%

Y‚Äôall need to relax
God damn today was frustrating for me. Honestly glad it‚Äôs over. Tomorrow‚Äôs a new day
$195 puts on NDAQ? ..hmm
CPI time boiiiiizzzzzz!!!!
2 months is currently the maximum
Market dropped damn near everyday at close, you really think
They‚Äôre going to make it this easy??? Start closing your position
Low volume days diff
Come on chpt close at 20$ please baby
The history of SoFi going back to SPAC days is one of wild runs and equally wild crashes.
Buy $AMC calls before market closes. The headphone stock I can't say will pump AH and idiots will buy AMC and it will open up 5%+ tomorrow.
Interesting that the MAGA ETF is top 6% ytd ranking on Morningstar.  Was bottom 96th percentile in 2018 when Trump was pres.  Biden is a better MAGA president than the Donald.
Just lost a SHIT ton on that pump
!banbet F 20 6W
these candles is out of control just like the hoes
a TLRY bull run would be nice
My mistake, I guess theta gang thought it could trap bears *two* more times before EOD 

LOL
The dip buyers are coming back. The market is healing.
SOFI GAVE ME 19 REASONS TO CUM
She called the peak of oil two years ago... that's working out well
my poor bladder
Next up $20
Sounds suspiciously like a buy low, sell high strategy.
SPY is worth buying in the 432s but not the 433s
Failed dump
Poverty.
You should pick a number and then if no success you should buttchug a red bull
Bears love rocky mountain oysters
I've got 464c for that date too lol
J. Powell has been seen with J. Ma in Hong Kong today. Plot?
Who buying CROX at these levels? I've been thinking about it for a minute. Looks like a decent entry
idk i bought apple calls fuck it
I had to work for it, but I finally got a green day.
2 months is currently the maximum
Fuk and short DLO, all my boys use PSFE!
Well I‚Äôm holding calls so I‚Äôm cool if it takes the bears to the cleaners lol
Autocorrect üòí
I have a smokin hot wife.   Meanwhile you troll around reddit to get laid

Hmmm that failed pump ‚ô•Ô∏è
So you‚Äôre saying I should have sold HOOD at 85?
!banbet NIO 40 7w or I‚Äôll put a Chinese chopstick up my ass
# WOWO Very Fuking Legit Greeen Dildo SPY
Bulls walking their baby balls up wall street this afternoon, they‚Äôll have to see us tomorrow üß∏üòà
Welp I just bought a spy put but I'm all out of day trades .well til tommorow folks
ARKK looking strongggg! 

keep on turning your shoulder to it!
That unnatural red candle was the biggest load of manipulation I've ever seen...probably stop loss shakeout
!banbet TSLA 800 2d
I think today SPY put in a higher low on the Daily chart, lets see if we go up from here! üöÄ
i thought i was down bad with 11/19 460c that i have cost basis of .96 lol
Do the math. SPY will go up
I am in gaming manufacturing etc.. getting controllers/microchips etc has been damn near impossible. there is a Sony Dual shock shortage since last year with no signs of good stock showing up for the holidays. Word of advice IMHO Corsair will not hit their estimates and will come up very short next earnings and blame it on supply problems.  NOVEMBER 8 is earnings be careful
I bought TSLA poots.

I hate money.
Lol that stock kept going up after than crazy run yesterday?  I cashed in short side at 18.5 can‚Äôt believe it had another Green Day after
SOFI is like edging for 3 hours just waiting to bust a furious and ground breaking load
holee fuck, Sofi can't break 19
Lol you bought it at 13 few weeks ago?
If you are buying spy calls rn you must be allergic to money
Get in LTC. TA looks good. Bullish. REITS are strong plays right now and it‚Äôs been oversold on low volume.
Lift Yourself by Kanye West is a great representation of the market right now
Another fake pump again Jesus fucking Christ
Market rotation into Corsair gaming accessories. Because that's safe haven.
i still dont really get the impact of MOC imbalances but $696m sell to $1.3b buy seems like a fairly big deal
this ponzi just refuses to die
The Mouse takes the bears to the cleaners on any TF larger than the daily.

I know from experience.

\*shows gaping chasm\*
SOFI gonna launch to $20 once they remove the sell pressure at $19
Thigh gap is in between
This is a mockery of a fucking market
hasnt because 4 faang companies held it up. the entire market besides those and handful others are down all yr

85% below 200ma

wake up
So... SPY is down about 0.3%. Meanwhile, UVXY is down over 2.6%.
Bears 3:50pm: ALRIGHT GUYS LET'S EOD DUMP!

Bulls 3:55pm: Dump negated. Thanks for the dip.
I dunno but all my Uranium stocks are ripping and I'd appreciate it if anyone has any insight! Are we mooning or just getting ready to dump again, falling short of the Sept 15 peak?
Oh AMZN you dirty slut
Why baba suck pepe
Bro SOFI and that $19 line are going at it
Spy rallying in last 5mins to get us to 0.00% for the day
Bulls finally showing some end of day balls. Been awhile.
OCGN GET IT WHILE IT'S HOT!!!
lol I just got cucked so hard. Whatever at least I broke even
[deleted]
I wonder how many bulls are gunna fall for this trap too üòπ
Sold a bunch at 433 üò¨
Jesus look at that stupid V
Oh baby im gonna pop
Just break $19 before I kill myself. Fuk
üòÇ Wilf just said Micron but I thought I heard buttcorn.
gotta teach me, I'm down so much, please
2 months is currently the maximum
Bought calls cause f it. If we go down tomorrow I average down or sell for minor loss. But more than likely we finna moon tomorrow.
Last call for some OCGN before the rocket üöÄ
You mean EOG resources? Which has been on a tear.
What does SPY even make?
Bagholding SPY444 10/15Cs bought at 5.80 like an absolute retard lol
Towards the sun
!banbet F 20 6W
Damn DIS giving my portfolio a light beating rn, need a bounce back performance tomorrow
I guess unless it opened perfectly flat this would always be true
Us bears get at least a close or two a year.

I haven't felt this warm since March 2020.
Lol at the sell wall for SOFI at 19
Attention üñ§ Anyone buying calls or puts. You are fucked for the next 6 months. Enjoy.. while HFs and company make billions selling you that worthless shit. Buy long or go home.
Gap down

Target $380
$ASTS - grab while it‚Äôs still on sale.  $13+ share price by end of the week
Sell preemptively to prevent your ass getting gaped

I highly recommend a link shortener my friend.
I can't find any reason for it and would really like to know if it's gonna dump again or if we're gonna keep heading towards that beautiful Sept 15th peak!
Sorry. I thought those were already out of business.
[deleted]
Not me i always buy calls 10inutes before close
What direction will your ass be pointing?
Lol CRSR wtf are you doing?
Gap up or gap down tomorrow. No in between
You made a really short custom ban bet (None) which was not accepted.
Don't put any text after the time token (1m, 1w, 15d) if you don't intend to carry out an interesting punishment to get unbanned early.
I just Fibonacci the Spy calculations has it opening $436 tomorrow then closing $440.50
Always see that craziness right before the London market closes 940-955a
Haven‚Äôt held equities overnight in weeks.  I just short the indexes if the buying gets too hot and buy if they fall to a key support too quickly.  I‚Äôve been on my best run in months.
All I wanted was SDC to boom but I can wait‚Ä¶.
Maybe MARA.
Bagholder spotted.

SLAP. THAT. ASK PEOPLE
I wouldn‚Äôt make fun of moe he actually knows his shit lol. Not his fault NIO is being held down by bears but they should be dead by NIO day. NIO is a great company.
5 minute pump to shave 15% off my puts
!banbet bulls are fucked üß∏
Uranium melt up keeping my portfolio green today
Also H+S forming for BABA on the daily. 

It closed, yet again, below the major ascending channel. Plow time.
Is it in yet? I don't feel anything. You see, I've been gaped so many times in the past, I really need something substantial to get excited anymore
You don't see down as the direction
Its like August just never happened...
SOFI $19 resistance is tremendous rn
2 months is currently the maximum
But you have to make it to the future first.
Just remember the market can remain flat and gay for a long, long time....

It will.  Needs more shakeout I think.  Cash gang right now.
Straight people forced straightness down üåà people‚Äôs throats for years. This is revenge. Kids will be bullied in school in the future for being straight now.

No no. You have to post bad strats before they fail. That way everyone can share in the fun. 

When they fail, you act like you farted in a crowded elevator and say nothing, hoping they blame it on the person next to you

i keep reminding myself that wall street, and definitely main street, has goldfish memory - "this trend will definitely never reverse!" - but i'm having a hard time trying to theorize what will snap the market out of its funk right now
I am bag holding so much telecom... "5G iS tHe fUtUrE!"
As the Afghans said to the Americans, you have all the clocks, but we have all the time...
Been holding SOFI heavy and long!!
amd beating the market
At least snap is pumping ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
When in the past 10 months has SPY had a downtrend or stayed flat for more than a month?
Can it be in five minutes?
Lmfao. U should see rental cars and hotels. ü§°
Ok, MRO, now all you have to do is trade flat for the next month or so

It‚Äôs very telling when the worst hour of the day is often power hour.  Power hour is when institutional activity is often at its highest.  This is slowly unfolding distribution selling by institutions and insiders onto bagholders.
Thx
Feels like we‚Äôve priced in pretty bad numbers already.
Yea they are called superüÖ±Ô∏èUssy now you üÖ±Ô∏èigot!!!
Yup, I'm surprised by my consistency at buying calls only to see SPY immediately reverse.
Ocgn 0 shares available to short. It‚Äôs gonna rocket get in therrre boooys
i love dog water
Spy CEO‚Äôs  emails must have leaked
Power hour is not a thing anymore
Same it‚Äôs going to sell even more maybe 431?
PROG died in 15min
My YANG calls are the man who can‚Äôt be moved.
Also if you sell your puts today before market close, you‚Äôre making a big mistake ü•∞ü•∞
If we knew that, we'd all be fucking rich.

Big ass bear candles on the 1D, H4, and lower timeframes thouugh pretty much says Puts are the play. Or maybe write calls against SPY/SPX. At least until EOD tomorrow lol.
mostly butt stuff
I think it'l;l jump before close. and hopefuly close +20%. It has high short interest, and there are a shit ton of shorts stuck. I do believe there'll be a stock offereing, but that has only made the stock jump another couple of days in the past.
Last chance to buy calls before JPM earnings pump tomorrow
Man if it dumped to 420 id cum instantly
[deleted]
Its jesus
Just the regular last minute dump. Nothing to see here
What‚Äôs a share?
Man my spy p were lookin shitty next thing I check boom I'm up
Buy November QCOM calls. This is financial advice
Arrowhead is worse then Dasani?
Haven't tested horoscopes either, but I know they're shit

I love chunky biatches. Fat fupa is life!!!
Break and ripüìàüìàüìàüìà
damn, spy 200 gang back... hide yo loved ones
Remember when we made new ATH 3 days a week. I sort of remember, but it's foggy. Would be nice to know what that feels like again. By the time it happens again I'll have my account juiced full of 3 year Bear market and be ready for retirement. Just need to stop gambling options until then and go over to r/investing
hmmmm so today Bostic finally admits inflation is not going anywhere, spy and the qqqs take a massive dump into the close the day before CPI? yeah... load them poots boys
I blewwwww it
[deleted]
I hope all y‚Äôall that bought SOFI 19c sell EOD. it‚Äôs been knocking but hasn‚Äôt broken, and with the current market sentiment, profit is profit. Could moon tomorrow and could go back to 18
Market players would cut each other's throat for another dollar. There is no coordination.

Also, algos trade, not humans
SPY will go up .2% tomorrow

Had to wait all fucking day to cash those puts out on SPY
I‚Äôve literally fell asleep in the market this week.  Nothing has happened. Pick a direction

You ape, but MARA before it‚Äôs too late. I told you when it was trading at $20
Got it there!!

Hmm this sell off seems just a tad early
Bought Facebook at the daily bottom /flex. Now time to eat shit when they miss earnings and nosedive.

# 430 EOD. Drill It.
\*plane crash noises\*
Oh spy what a fat dumper you have
Ofc closed puts for small gains so more red incoming
I had this brilliant investing idea a while ago. 

There is this site  https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/calendars/fda-calendar which lists all stocks with upcoming catalysts, trial phases and FDA approval dates etc.

The idea was to buy 50 stocks with upcoming phase 3 trials coming up and hope a few of them jump +200%. 

In the end it was a huge loss, most companies went down huge and none jumped 200% on approval. 

Terrible strategy.
SPY chose to die
Up 20% fuck it ima hold em
Someone realllllllllyyyyyyy doesn't want SOFI above $19
Grabbing Spy $435 calls for tomorrow‚Äôs gap up

Tomorrow you're going to get your anus gaped.
$19 is just the condom on SoFi's semi-erect cock

Once it's hard and throbbing it'll raw dog $20 like an animal
spy decides to fall off of a cliff I guess
wow youre so good beating the algos boo
Yeah I bet this isn‚Äôt coordinated at all.

I don't see how the FOMC can be anything but hawkish come Nov 3rd. But I've been fooled before.

Fking finance media is dang useless. As retarded as this sub is, it's way ahead in news. Thanks. Might open strangles.
Urgent need for those shares. Maybe they had a spread or a more complex position open and they got assigned on a leg?

Or they think it's going to dump, and because liquidity usually sucks on deep ITM options this was the best way to exit the position.

VIX red while indices red today def supports a melt up idea. Not good for short term heavily OTM options but good for seeing 1% gains on the spy between a couple flat red/green days. VIX is very much just a measure of Liquidity, the lower it goes, the more there is. Probs going red because institutions are taking advantage of high IV to sell expensive tails.
idk if buttcorn holders or tsla investors are more retarded but both make probably more money than me with my boomer stocks. and to me the charts look eerily similar for the past 3 years or so.

SPY is just like my cat Spy. Just wondering around without a direction.
Just burn it all to the ground, fuck it.
Psychologically, "near wins" stimulate the brain the same way actual wins stimulate the brain. Which is why people keep pulling the slot machine lever and why we keep buying options that expire worthless.
FB to the moon, let's goooooo
**How much $20,000 invested in SPY leaps at the bottom in March 2020 is worth today?**

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On **March 23** the price of **SPY 12/17/21 $342** strike calls was **2.00**. Lets say we used $20k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

SPY 12/17 $342 calls are at the ask price of **93.39** which gives us a total value of:

#$933,900

plz save me zuck ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
could easily reverse depending on CPI in the morning
the best thing about using a cash account is you can make exactly 1 all in daytrade yolo each day, set your profit and your stop and then whatever happens once you close your position you can't trade until tomorrow. it's a great to prevent over/revenge/emotional trading after a big win or loss.

I want to kick your dads ass then
370-380 is a reasonable value for SPY
first its gonna pump.... then its gonna dump.... kinda like your dad.... into your girlfriend... when youre not home... cuz your mom died
Cant fake numbers bro lol
CPI is at like 830 I think so idk if it'll have the chance to pump
Sideways with a chance of going down

I believe this is the ‚ÄúQ‚Äù in the LGBTQIA+ acronym
SOFI should easily reach its highs of $24 again at this rate. Truly one of the few meme stocks thats actually a good company.
They can be called away anytime, but unless they‚Äôre deep ITM then it‚Äôs at expiry if they‚Äôre just $0.01 or more ITM/ATM.

With 3 weeks it‚Äôs very rare unless there is a dividend coming up
SPY waiting for me to sell my 11 $434 10/13 expiry puts before it tanks. Well guess what you stupid etf. I'm not fucking selling.

Holding puts into November. Bears are in control.

also a head and shoulders in the last hour and a half and lower highs all day. I think we‚Äôre gonna dump

Rklb dumping
I can‚Äôt unload until tomorrow üò≠ wish me luck with CPI lol
You're right. Boring companies can make money too. But healthcare is just too boring for me and I would never hold through a correction so for that reason I stay out. I just want people to think about what they're actually investing in
still not selling SOFI.
Did they sell their shares? I thought damn near all of em are locked
Never been more bullish in my Life till today
Any other smooth brains Always Money Chasin out here?
Forgot all about having CCJ to hold until late next year...then see it's up 12%...guess alternative energy stocks are hitting just like oil

So cool.  Go make some money so you can buy the other whiner a computer.
sounds stupid.
Holy shit, sold my SoFi at the absolute top today at $18.98. I fucking nailed it. I‚Äôll be buying it up again after the run up stabilizes. 1st time I caught the top like that

No. For you to be gay you need to have a gender. A transgender over another trans idk probably frog

If you stop buying options right now you can stop the bleeding

Bulls and bears
Only thing bullish right now is OCGN, TSLA, amd VIX lol
CMCSA is getting shit on because of streaming weaknesses. I expect viac to also shit the bed upon earnings.
Learn from your mistakes
I‚Äôll buy them and watch you cover for losses. It‚Äôs kang gang szn out here ü¶ò
Just once I want to be the one cashing in on someone else‚Äôs ruination. The bottom falling out of TSLA and a huge fraud being uncovered would fit the bill
Nah vix is ded
*GET THETAGANGED*
I think that is designed specifically for GM.
Makes sense but I know a guy (me) who said that about some dude selling books out of his his garage! Wasn"t very exciting??? Talk about OOps.
SPYs chart today looks terrifying

Bleach is good, do UV for rona, etc.
Possibly $100 down the drain if it really does drop and no one will buy them. I plan to be out by noon if possible
Only thing bullish right now is VIX ü§£
Fuck. Dump faster stupid market.
Fed has to act on inflation now that it's damaging our corporate overloads and not just crushing poors at the grocery store and gas pump. Looking like a long slide down for the market.

i think he means enhanced safety, cleaning, testing for crew, etc

SPY literally retarded
Everything is blood red 40min left for bear attack 
‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ
That‚Äôs what I like to hear!

Hate to say it, but bearish at the moment. Don't like to be, but there's no volume or movement.
It wouldn‚Äôt be spy, if we didn‚Äôt end up even for the day.
thank you. I have them
Bought some 4/13 427 puts and 4/13 440 calls. Wish me luck:)
I just looked at them, and IV is way too high.  I might sell some call spreads, though.  If you're so confident, place a ban bet.

CHPT puts easy money
I‚Äôm up 7k today lol
Now all your frogs are going to be ghey.
This market is so Fed dependent that it will fall apart with but a single rate increase, which could come faster than is expected due to inflationary pressures
Losing so much money on the bank plays
yep my SOFI shares are definitely getting called away
Lol
Uranium gains anyone? I‚Äôm up like 30% today
Up 2.4% at peak and down on calls - this is classic WSB
Except it‚Äôs not a guarantee to be approved. If you‚Äôre so confident, buy some puts. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Reversal to green incoming. 10min
Burry is several years too early imo. He should dial it down and wait till everything collapses and then say, told you so. Lol
it just feels like it's gonna bounce high AF off 434 into close... may feel like that because i have puts. but who knows
Every time I buy RSI, the contracts are .10cents lower when I check back. Buy again. Then another .10 cents lower. 



I don‚Äôt like this game
That vaxx will help keep your symptoms from being too severe
Gonna stop trading options, again!
Union EV tax credit good or bad for TSLA? I don‚Äôt think they have unions do they?

I‚Äôm actually just wanting it to move substantially in either direction. These low volatility days are miserable.
Bought some PAGS calls this morning. Up nicely so far.
That‚Äôs not the news people are waiting on. WHO EUA approval/denial comes out this week and that‚Äôs straight from WHO themselves.
CLNE making a little move the last few days with the oil prices going up.
Why ?
Bout time we start drilling
Fuk you sofi.
If we don‚Äôt go below 433.70 today, you might be right. CPI tomorrow tho could push us down through it
People dumping their sofi positions before close
I'm gonna lol if it turns out Laundrie already got killed by someone who cared about Gabby Petito and they hid the body and covered their tracks pretty well and they still just go to work every day and chuckle to themselves a bit
\*sigh\* so you are telling me that potentially I actually have to trade stocks again and not spy options anymore
He trash. He will be in bones if we wake him up after 5 years. Already lives near trash, homeless swine
Good job man. All going to schedule.

Bought the dip with all the cash I had left back in September. Now we wait
If we have yet another 3pm-close dump I am going to be so mad

Really wish someone would just dump 2mil more into CLNE. Super easy pump.
Now we‚Äôre cooking with gas
Anyone buying the SPY dip or na
Rklb crash landing
Gold, bonds
Load them puts, looks like a sell off again
I will be focusing on shit posting until SPY picks a direction
I‚Äôm none of those.  Now go fuck your self.
Damn when fomo actually pays off
it was kind of funny at first but this is actually depressing. SPY legit stayed 434 the whole day
Did Burry hit his head somewhere? Looks like he has gone back a few years
In 5 years, I don't even think the world will exist
Are Mgm Puts too obvious? Just for a small pull back tomorrow?
Sour hour gonna be so sour, you‚Äôll think my wife had her legs open
I don't know why the India Covaxin news wasn't a prominent headline in Yahoo Stocks and in my brokerage interface. Instead you have these ass headlines like "Why OCGN is on fire today". That's why I'm skeptical.

Wouldn't be surprised if it tanked tomorrow.

Sure, but what I'm really asking is how is this not already priced in and what makes you think it's going to 4x from here?
Now who will endlessly pump 450 10/15 calls to the masses?
Hell hath no fury like a   .............. scorned.   Me too was great.  Honestly.   Sifting through Gruden's 10 year old emails for dirt.  Fuck off.

Do we have zero solutions üòÇ for the shit? It‚Äôs going to cause a supply shock and more fake ass supply driven inflation
Love how inflation worries increase, spy slopes down, and hits downtrend resistance, with increasing sell orders in the order book. I bought puts yesterday in GM and Ford because of this and got screwed. Thanks!

It has been proven to be just as effective. And is one of very few if any that were tried and tested specifically against the Delta variant. It also just received emergency use authorization in India(country of over 1 billion people) for those 2-18 years old. It is also expected to get approval from the WHO shortly which would expand its use globally(not to US/Canada right now.. but globally

Still can buy put
Women are outperforming men when investing, lmfao

How much bleach should I drink for the full effect?
Absolutely not. Biggest catalyst yet to come
That I bought most of mine around $7.50 and I couldn't find much else I liked. Just praying the WHO news breaks during/just before market hours so I can sell the news on her.

Edit: also it's only a couple dollars above its usual floor and the last couple times there were speculative runs on it, it went all the way to mid teens. I see it breaking 12ish at some point this week, which would be an exit I like.
Yep, currently getting fucked on my qqq calls
bruh ive been waiting for an entry point all day lmaoo
Sure, but it'll cost you $5 per minute.

Make up your mind SPY...up and down more times than I have this year
Water is actually not wet; It makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the state of a non-liquid when a liquid adheres to, and/or permeates its substance while maintaining chemically distinct structures. So if we say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the object.
Sexist if you are a woman. Racist if you are black or brown. Discriminatory if you are gay.......everyone is a victim these days.    Probe some more emails, who gives a shit

Write it in your journal tonight

That‚Äôs what I figured, I just sold a good profit around 18.30 but beating myself up since still going strong. However been with the stock for a few months and feel like it dips after going so strong.

Price target for OCGN after hours? $13?
No, not at all. SPY has gone up 30% this year alone which is fucking insane in of itself. It seems like now especially, people are investing into hype and short term volatility more than relying on fundamentals. The top is coming quite soon it would seem, and even when you take a look at the Covid market crash of March 2020 you find one aspect that is worrisome: that the market recovered FAR too quickly.

Imma need a miracle for my 11c 10/15 Clne calls to b worth something
buying a shit ton of QCOM calls for a quick flip. Seems super oversold overall. Low P/E and four consecutive red days. Solid company that's bound for a jump imo. Even with the chip shortage shenanigans
Ocugen I suspect will reach at least $40 and then fall back to earth

Get in while it's hawt n ready üòâ
Who made that bag on GWH?
Why is your gf on your phone ?
Whole fucking day it‚Äôs at 434
FSR the return üî•
Mark this. In a year you will look back and say OOps missed that one!
TSLA put boys still alive?
Astros should be right fit
I‚Äôm too busy to write a full DD but the entire telecom sector has been selling off due to panic over a solar storm that will hit the Earth tomorrow. Look at the first date it was reported, it aligns perfectly with the start of the drop.

This fear is overblown. Satellites are exposed to cosmic rays constantly and are hardened to resist this. At worst there will be some service disruption and pretty night sky.

Buy the T and VZ dip.
OCGN calls if you wanna forget about your SPY woes for a bit üöÄ
Quick, gimme an FD play for power hour
OCGN about to creep past 9.50 baby
Imagine selling covered calls on GWH yesterday morning...
Hopefully it stays up.  

Can I get a flair for fastest ban bet win? Took less than 3 hours

I sold a short put with strike of 80 back when it was over 80. Sold another one today with strike of 67. I will probably be rolling these quite a while.
Girlfriend just fatfinger-closed one of my positions... Luckily just -60 bucks, but now I need to keep an eye out for these sneaky portfolio assassination attemtpsüôÑ

What's the death by thousand cuts?
Jokes on you, im the red ranger
GJ to everybody who made that bag today
Everyone here is a downie
NXRP is fucking ripping
No I‚Äôll switch to calls in November
Dump any minute now
Whoever is trading SPY or QQQ via options I feel so bad for you Lmaoo

JOMBI SAYS CLOV GO GREEN EOD
Theta Gang = New York Yankees


Bears= RedSox

The year is 2031. SPY is at $434.50
Homie, I‚Äôm taking theta gang‚Äôs money today on sq, upstart and affirm. Idk what you‚Äôre talking about
Let‚Äôs go AEI?
God $ZS is an incredible stock
Are you always this üåà üêª?
That‚Äôs quite a bounce!
Lot of companies out there with $50B valuations that make $500M per year, or less, with negative margins.  

Is this level of speculation really sustainable?
I think it will slowly go up
Once spy breaks resistance w big volume, im going all in on weeklies.
Tomorrow FOMC and CPI. Great time to flip a coin.
The trend has been very weak closes, so maybe. Look at the volume. It's like it's still September.
$SOFI power hour coming up
I have 10k buying power burning a hole in my screen!!!! I hate this market though‚Ä¶
how many weeks are there in two months?
Uranium is ironically making my portfolio glow green today.
Power hour, no more dips, When I rip you rip we rip?
lol MU. Haven't paid attention to this stock in a while. Apparently it's now at 66. Last time I checked it was mid 70s. Down 4% today.

Any of you autists still holding these bags? /u/MartyMoho, where are you?
Made a good move on $OCGN. üöÄ
OCGN moving up nicely. cant wait to see how we fly with who approval!
Hate myself so buying up CLOV calls cause fuck it
Does that make market go downies
This market is fucking g word. Theta gang fucking feasting.
Spy to make new daily low by close?
kek gvt finally realizing they have to admit inflation is a thing
This is what BanBet was created for brother
Really wish some one would just dump $3mil into CLNE at $10.
Calls on theta gang
Whats the big catalyst?
Theta gang wins today
We‚Äôre in the roaring twenties boys
Like $300, mostly porn and fritos
2 months is currently the maximum
Yes

Apple event announced for next Monday, easiest play.

Buy calls tomorrow afternoon, hold till Friday and sell. Buy puts at the end of the day Friday and sell Monday afternoon.

Thank me later.
The people in it hate it, the people trying to enjoy the daily love it that the tickets are excluded. You can‚Äôt make either group happy for long
!banbet SPY 425 8W
puts on bears and bulls portfolio
Say it with me now. Staaaaagflation
There are a bunch of figures being reported Friday
Apparently kang gang is back in town
Gotta read the volatility baby ü¶ò
So debt ceiling gets resolved tonight, we get some flreports tomorrow morning then QQQ rips to 365. No TA, no Crystal Ball, just use common sense and intuition to lose my $$$
Yeah, that's far enough that we might see a decent spike once. Earnings are in 2 weeks too. Deep OTM calls? Or is it better to buy more ITM when it's that far away?
Is everyone just taking turns buying calls and puts on spy at this point?
Gonna get it right eventually
I love when a position goes from -80% to +200%. This is the shit I live for.

At this point I'm rooting for SDC to 'moon' so you'll shut the fuck up about it.
SPY perfectly balanced for CPI numbers
- Good - go up to 440
- Bad - go down to 430
Puts, have you not noticed any patterns lately?
An algorithm making a thousand trades/sec
but there were like 5 posts about big accounts going all in. totally not coordinated in anyway !
P E A S A N T
u/zjz perfect example of why we need the popular ticker thread. These shrills freaking out over hardly anything
CLOV puts inevitable?
New Apple event the 18th. Time to purchase calls that won‚Äôt be worth shit once the event airs
Legit me. I'm either making $2,000 or I'm losing the entire trade
I hope everyone gets into OCGN under 10 and holds to $30!!
Do a poll

Everytime it goes on a run I get so close to dumping these bags‚Ä¶been averaging down for months
If you bought clov, congratulations cause you fell for the hype. Tell me, are you really that excited about a HEALTHCARE insurance company? Hell no, boring as shit so I guarantee you don't hold when it dips again
If SDC doesnt squeeze, its a classic case of retail losing to hedgies, already have alot of SDC paper hands just this week to enter the next FOTM (FOTD, Flavor the day more like it)
do you think Elon is mad that Shatner is going to space in Bezos rocket

Puts price in a downward move, and it has to move down MORE than that for you to make money.  

If I buy an OTM put and the price goes down 5%, a lot of the time you still lose money on that put. If I short and it goes down 5%, I make 5%.

we go ups , we go downs, I have downs.
I wish I knew which group was larger, some people love it, some people hate it.

Step one is to pack up her things in boxes for when she comes back.  When she does, do not have a conversation with her, simply say that she cheated and that‚Äôs a deal breaker.

Step two is to block her number and social media.  Do not ask her friends or yours how she is doing, go full no contact and heal how you can.  

Step three is to have as best a bday as possible with your friends and family and do it your way.  Surround yourself with the people that are there to support you.  

Step four is to do something small and positive for yourself every day.  I found working out and meditating to be helpful for me, but to each their own.  

Stay strong, you‚Äôre gonna be ok.

In case you‚Äôre still living in the past and not looking to the future, Astra announced their new launch dates and the findings/resolution of their last launch failure. If/when they reach orbit, their business model is so ahead of the game it leaves all their competitors in the dust. So get in while it‚Äôs still under $10. ASTR

Selling GME calls is like taking candy from a baby.
I mean what I‚Äôm describing is absolutely not an exact science but say a ticker is experiencing a clearly defined up or downtrend. 

If you see volume dropping off, it indicates that the buyers/sellers (depending on the direction the ticker is trending) are running out of steam. Lowering volume in an uptrend indicates fewer people are willing to buy at the current levels. 

Same in a downtrend, less people willing to sell at current levels. 

When volume drops off enough that no one is really selling/buying anymore, the price levels out. That‚Äôs a good point to either sell and lock in profits after an uptrend, or enter a position on stocks you‚Äôve been watching in a downtrend.

There are also technical patterns you can look for to pair with volume that may indicate the direction the market is going. Again, it doesn‚Äôt predict the future, it just helps inform your guess.

Edit: it works on a macro and micro level. I‚Äôve used this on the 1m for day trading or on the 1Y for stocks that have seen a correction.
Hope to see TSM run up a smidge before close. If nothing else IV should increase.
CPI numbers tomorrow

Venmo me.
Turned spy loss into spy gain by re buying. Puts. 434/435. Oct 13/15. Got to 30-40 % and about 20% -30% on 80k position on each. 


434 bought 1.40 and sold just under 2, around 1.85-1.97 mostly the 1.97. 


435 bought 2.65, 2.9, sold 3.4. 


Cleared about 46k. Good after losing this morning on that dive. Lost 14k there. 436 calls 433 puts. Just bad timing. Glad I went back in. 


FB swinging share trades around 300-900 shares in batches between the SPY calls/puts, and at 318-322.
At least you think you can get out. My positions are 100% fucked this week unless I see a 20% movement up which is not happening even in my fucking dreams lol

Haven‚Äôt seen green in so long
Told y‚Äôall yesterday volume has been abysmal in both directions, indexes are a theta trap rn imo
so here is the deal with sofi, and I told you assholes to go full hog last week. They are getting the bank charter. I think it will be Nov 1. They have a motherfucking moat like no one else bc unlike SaaS, BaaS takes the Treasury and FDIC to approve you which takes time. SaaS was different you could just say ur a software company and trust them on their word that they would make money. And there was a lot more competition in that space. Sofi is way ahead of everyone in this space. The Boomer banks kind of suck at it so they aren't competition. There you go. This stock will be 250 in years. 75-100 next year. 25 by end of this year and 50 by march

Lol yeah, like clockwork. Did you not see the obvious bear trap after we tested 434 for like 15 minutes to no drill? Go back in my comments and name one bad play today. I'm here getting rich, what are *you* doing here? Bitching and moaning? Get your 436s now baby boy

I panicked sold my puts for the 10th time today with that spike....
For the sake of my calls I‚Äôm gonna say you‚Äôre right
spy perma frozen at 430s until everyone on WSB becomes homeless from decay
Should I drop my short (in at 136) and call it a loss or is this thing due to drop like a stone?
GE came to fix my fridge today. He saw I was losing bigly on SPY and did the repair for free
It‚Äôll likely match last months or be slightly higher/lower but I don‚Äôt expect it to be really low.

I bought a shitty weed penny stock a year ago when it was 0.12, 0.13 and averaged down for 6 months. Ended up pulling the plug at maybe a 5k loss. Checked it today and it‚Äôs 0.041. 

If you don‚Äôt believe the thesis anymore, get out. Holding to convictions is important, but knowing when to fold is too. Don‚Äôt emotional (wishful lol) trade

i was once in a similar situation and kept averaging down on a stock that ended up getting de-listed. luckily it wasn't quite as much money but still felt like a bonehead

averaging down on a losing play is a horrible strategy and just compounds losses

You have a choice to make. Get out now and eat the loss or stay invested and load up on covered calls that can get you close to breakeven.

If you feel compelled then stop trading, sell out, and get some help.

It's shares, so I have some hope, but I've painted myself into a corner without the skills/knowledge to get out and feel like I'm digging a deeper hole for myself with the average-down attitude when I should've just sold at a loss a long time ago.

Not a doomer but I feel pretty good about my long puts. SPY just hasn't felt strong in weeks. If we're this weak coming into OPEX, what will the next week and a half look like?
I think this is all good for the long term growth of semis.  The quantity crunch allows prices to rise, and as quantities slowly return to normal, prices have made new foundational levels.  I don‚Äôt think TSMC/Samsung will reduce their prices just because supplies have become more accessible in 2023/2024.  

The key is to buy and hold for a longer reach.  Most short term weekly/monthly options are going to get drained.
i'd guess either investors don't believe oils going to stay at that price (reasonable), or oil is so hated it just never goes up (zoom out lol)

Steve Weiss hiding in the moderna cuckshed
At least I have SOFI today
No risk, no reward. I should've brought ess at 14 like I wanted to. I even deposited more money, and told myself, I'll buy it after the dip back to 12
Who's pumping GWH ??
SPY still going through it's dying throes I see
bought it in 2014 @ 48.
I don't.  I give a fuck about competition.

Imagine wanting to buy a state sponsored company like Apple instead of letting capitalism and the market do its thing.

America loves capitalism until American companies can't compete.
It's a stick shift you mongoloid
Spy/QQQ sideways week.

üÖ±Ô∏èack to üÖ±Ô∏èussin‚Äô next week
I invested in ASML and it is down 1.43% immediately. They said this was a solid company to invest in :(
Is this like Ford building tens of thousands of chipless cars because they would definitely get chips by q3?
Lolol a LinkedIn link? You gotta be joking
At least 5% down in all my stocks today, had a brief promise of green early this afternoon
It does make it more difficult to yolo all in but at the very least you could go all in 1x per day just not multiple times.
Volume is so low. Where did everyone go
Guys please don‚Äôt call extraterrestrial beings ‚Äúaliens‚Äù it offends me and hurts my feelings.
Idk maybe not with tapering this close lol the last few CPI months when we were sky high sure
whats the news on the ticker? seems like an a candidate for puts
Shitty internet money mining company, market cap too small to post ticker here, call for 1/21/22
Imagine giving a fuck about Huawei.
Stock TSP had its Lock-up Expiration happen TODAY...  
I thought it was going to crash but instead its up +6.6% wowww good thing I did not buy PUTS as originally planned...  
Might buy them now tho...
Quit shifting into drive before you've come to a complete stop...

You're not. Are you still solvent? Once you're not solvent, the market will un-retardify.
Another spy dump pretty please
PROG should hit 400 million+ in volume today, to the moon is an understatement.

Just when you think Spy done it runs up $2 in blink of an eye
Depends on what it is? SPY calls?
"they don't want it below 434"
depends on the amount at risk and what youre willing to lose
10/15 for the 450 play. 200,000 OI

Samsung aren‚Äôt a tech company. 

They‚Äôre about 300000000000000 years behind all their competitors and can‚Äôt come close to Thomas Edison in terms of tech.

so we're just going to chop around the rest of the week until opex? so shitty
I bought a bunch of stock at $318 (because options fuck me in the ass) but Im with you.
SDC puts seem to be the best option this week. Might be a good idea for folks who got in too late to make profit off of last weeks push.
At the beginning of the day it makes perfect sense
Samsung is just a bloatware company when it comes to their smartphone division
Tell her how much you make and show your dominance.

Down 30%, expiration date is 3 months away, what would you do?

Not theta. Spreads probably holding up ok too.
Well I sold the rest of my NVDA and AMD after Cramer sent an email hyping them on his investing club lol üòÇ‚Ä¶.at least he was honest and added that they are selling at a premium and interest rates rising could cause a sell off.
I‚Äôm convinced he and his partners are the unusual options most of the time. Pump those stocks and unload them right when he gets off the air.
Gruden‚Äôs grinders
Can Mr. Market just drop by 5% this week, kthxbai
Yeah that and id rather trade less tickers and have more focus.

Apple aren't a tech company.

Who are all the people buying new homes in this market?  I get why a pandemic would deplete supply but with prices as they are why are so many people buying?  I guess some are displacements from high cost of living areas that decided they can work from home for the same wage and pay less but that should mean high cost of living areas are seeing a drop in property values but NYC and the SF seem to have increases too.  Where are all the buyers coming from??

let's fucking goooo
SPY is riding the 100ma on the 30m pretty hard. I don't think there's enough volume for it to break in either direction. That shooting star was because it got too far above. If it gets too far below, look for a hammer.

If the dumpsters behind Wendy's are full, where do you guys go?
Downgrades. Also, high interest rates will hurt them because they both have so much debt. They have to take on lots of debt in order to build up infrastructure for 5G.

RIP LUV puts
DLO has a lockup expiration in 6 weeks and it's up 50% since the IPO. Puts are still pretty cheap.

already got the good news, selling before monday event
NOW FIX THAT SHIT NOW
Market flip flopping more than Joe Manchin
Yeah I‚Äôm personally not to impressed with the.  I had a 30$ pair of Amazon ones that sounded better.
The emergence of indeterminism from deterministic rules in chaotic systems is trippy, man

One Spy dump please
SPY looks like the childhood park metal slide that burned my ass every summer
Don't you always ask this and always end up fucking it up?
Uh oh üò¨
I'll buy if you're still selling
So whats the play guys; i just robbed the bum down the street for $6...need a 20 bagger üòé
UPST puts? Gonna be hit hard if CPI data is meh
Shortage will remain for lower end chips for a long time. Think your furnace control boards and shit like that.

Or they could redesign and use better node more "expensive" chips which are going to now be cheaper to produce due to not enough fabs to make the old tech stuff.


Atleast that has been my reading. 

And you're right shorting them now is smooth brained.
I can‚Äôt stand the guy. Epitome of arrogance
will at least double my money by Monday but looking to 3x it
IM WET RN
Don‚Äôt do it. Thank me later
Persistence&gt;
I would‚Äôve sold them to you for .04 cents each
Visualmod just called you a pussy.
I got 60k on the sidelines. What should I buy? Go all in into TQQQ?
[deleted]
Congrats! I‚Äôm still working on the margin call achievement
Dont buy anything today. Wait till tomorrow inflation data
The person who he bought them from, to be precise
SoFi bottle feeding my portfolio until it's big and strong
Whatever happens the rest of the day, you would have to be a maniac to hold calls into tomorrow. Luckily I'm off my medication
banbet! SPY 445 1d

Is spy $434 really just a dream?
which other lucky fellas bought puts at the top?üòÜ
Pretty sure he‚Äôs a masochist
We counting that push through 436 a double top for the day? That would mean watch out below and best to sell your shit and go cash gang for the day.
I‚Äôm excited for Friday. Gonna play some 0 dte on TSLA and lose all my money.
Nice gay little SPY pop for me to buy another put.

Yep, and anecdotally some banks and restaurants are closed today because 2021
How can I profit off the coming  civil war?
It‚Äôs okay SDC, you can do it when you feel it
I pass on that shit, I ask once. They can either give another time or I'm out.

Just like how ill play spy
I believe in my heart, balls, and dick that SPY is going to drop hard tomorrow. Less sure about whether or not we end today red, and I‚Äôm down pretty good on these stupid 10/20 433p‚Äôs. Just gonna hold them though.
SOFI keeps bouncing off the $18.50 level. Rockhard support there
I‚Äôd off myself if I was a bear.
Just got a couple DIS 175 calls exp 10/29, don‚Äôt seems pretty range bound to that 173-180 area so wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we bounce back to 175-178 by next week

Fuken Josh always looks trashed and not wanting to be on the show. Josh Buddy, can you at least try and make this a decent conversation?
There goes QQQ again. Day 5 red in a row.
Every autist herr in 2022

"why didnt i buy tdoc at $120"
yeah, looks like some kind of itm bullish straddle with the puts for downside protection and the calls to act as shares. bullish.
Only tards buy SDC. Autists actually buy stocks that make money
Held 3 shares for 13 months, still red

LOL. I can't even get put strikes anywhere near ITM.  WTH?
Going long on QS $65 jan 20 2023 calls
Well yea I just roll my eyes when I see new companies saying they‚Äôre going to see amazing growth‚Ä¶ margins are going to increase‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre delighting consumers‚Ä¶

Sure man. But where is all the money coming from? Seriously, earnings were up a ton last year because of the stimulus checks. But those are gone. Consumer debt has went up, not down. 

Why do you think supply chains are messed up? Could it be because we are trading paper for real goods? ü§î are those countries on to us?
He said the N word
Think you are looking at YTD chart, not 1yr‚Ä¶
We had a fucking agreement SDC
Yes I saw that drop and known about the report... May be they are investigating the short seller, not $DNA?
You think S&amp;P touches red territory again before end of day?
another short sighted clown autist that chases
Cornpop
Hey SDC you are really making me frown. Some kind of club you are!
well guess what you're an idiot
i see your point, i think your plan of action is on point.
It would suck to be a bear

Shooting star forming on SPY 30m
and next year itll be trash. 

so go chase it
SPY 435 is like when you ask a girl for a date and she says ‚Äúoh maybe‚Äù and then you wait and ask her again and she says, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see‚Äù, and then another time, ‚ÄúI have plans this weekend, maybe next weekend‚Äù until eventually you get the rejection and go back to 425 where you belong!!!!!
Yes

Lol yeah. Intel must be a shitty company then. /s

let me guess. no autists add sdc at 5.99$ but theyll want to join in at $7. got it. lol
Do something CLOV üëâüèºüêä
What? How could you be mad at it? Did you buy puts?
you have to ring the bell. then it usually comes. no without crashing first tho
sell 2 strangles on /es  expiring tomorrow 10 delta, takes 20k buying power, will make 400 at exp.
Jabra great too. I had AirPods and they absolutely sucked.
imagine getting cucked by Tim Cook
spike so I can make money, or dump so I can buy more!
does the futures effect the stocks or the other way around?
If enough actually get into sofi, it has potential
youre so edgy teaming up with citadel. so cool

good thing i invest and long. thanks for cheaper shares

Nope
Lol at institutions shorting/selling chip stocks during a chip shortage that is over now but demand will keep increasing bigly and was priced in back in March. I bet most of them are in this sub too only a WSB trader could be that smooth brained.
UVXY shares
almost -15% income, but hey, its going up tenths of a percent each month since. 

what a joke
That's actually down this past month too.  More than the other 2, and a ytd low.
Dad went out to buy some clov one day and he never came home üò¢
Yeah......
Dunno but short term expirations seem like a bad idea today
Hmm I'm over leveraged ü§î
ZM is trash. When the cover happens, though.üìàFor, at least a few hours.
and volatility is down.... pathetic bass ackwards market
The fact intel has 11 PE is disgusting when shit like Tesla has a PE of 400

Rumor has it that bears hibernate
nah man, think about the strip clubs, those girls gotta eat too! (not too much though)
Hello all, I am looking for a good stock/s to throw $20k into and profit in about 4 months for a project. I am thinking about something like HUT, CCXI, and/or SOFI but Idk yet. Any good ideas I can use?
Do they record every call? Is your task manager button unlocked? If every call isn‚Äôt recorded and your task manager button is unlocked so you can see when you are being recorded, then you can trade during unrecorded calls and slack off. Only need to try hard when you are being recorded.
Sennheisers man
This puts are making me smile
SoFi
It went 20% down on the short report (which was sus). Is there something new?
What's the play today I got 40K to spend bros
intc is also having some grubbling. ive been keeping an eye.
you mean calls? i sold at 17.5

FML. 

Bill Gates is associated with this "thing". the company makes batteries from iron, sand, and some other materials. some magical numbers touted out there. 10 yrs in business and 2M or so in sales for this year, next year its double digit multiples. its a SPAC and that doesnt sti well with me.

I‚Äôm not worried about the SPY. Drill team six is on vacation this week on a far away island
Is Burry an antivaxxer? He already has autism.
Yes you missed it ü•±
That settles it calls at 3:59:55
I have a low value portfolio, sub $1000 USD. It's split among 10 investments, 58% stocks, and 41% ETFs, and 1% Etherium. For the amount of money in the system, is this too diverse to make any money? Sure I have redundancy when an investment falters, but I usually only see gains of less than a percent per day.  
  
How can I optimize my portfolio?

So there is an investigation alert for $DNA and it goes ~15% up?
Nah just market makers knowing a beat is coming for TSM inevitably and they want to shake losers out. I sold hella puts on that today free fucking money
im definitely losing my ban bet now lol
Post your profits and he will be back faster then you can say Margin Call

Yea definitely but my only thing is now for me to make a nice gain it'll really have to pump hard because the contract I'm in already pumped 40 points for me to get back to break even. It'll have to pump another 40 for me to make $400 and I don't see the risk/reward being worth it but I'm gonna hold for about another hour

Well in case that I'm noticing is the IV goes up but then when the stock starts going down the IV starts going down causing the puts to lose a lot of value even when the stock is going down... Then it's also somewhat flipped on the way up...
Lol yikes

I just don't think think oil has much room to run. The natural gas shortage is a huge driver, so maybe until the end of the year, considering the market is forward looking. Oil is dividend king, super boomer heavy buyers. OPEC+ has been really unpredictable, using their power as a destabilizing force, mostly to US. They have been playing ball, but I almost expect a production increase within a month.
This is the 4th retest in around 2 weeks. I would say so.

IRNT Gamma this week. 3.4 mil OI on super low float of 4 mil at $15. 700% cost to borrow! Highest in the market. .42 days to cover. Can everyone on here buy 10 shares each? I always wanted to achieve the opposite of a short ladder attack, which is a bull ladder attack. If every1 buys 1 share at a time and repeats that 50-100 times, we could do what hedgies do by forcing the price up, using the payment for order flow robinhood utilizes to game the system in our favor.
That shit is wild... 5-10% moves daily, seemingly unrelated to its industry or interest rate boogaloo. I made good money a couple times, called the wrong direction a few more and lost money... it can't be kept down is my take! Lean toward calls üòâ

I'm glad that fucko will be gone. He literally pinned it on Pelosi calls and the fact that the infrastructure bill will magically rev up the market tenfold.
People actually followed him?

Also I may be blind but [I don‚Äôt see his name here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) I think he kept doing the command wrong and it never listed him
How is it possible to be this bad at trading?  If you take away one crazy meme option play from earlier this year, my account is down 24% on the year.  But because of that one trade I‚Äôm up 35%.  Everything since has been losses
Bruh I don't need to join your stupid ass sub just because I'm playing the market, beat it.
is dkng gonna go up or down from here?

Yeah. GME vet here agrees
Extrinsic value.
Sell and buy longer expiry calls.
Better yet, sell puts instead.
Holding these SOFI FDs till Friday like a dummy.
God, SPY needs to do something. I‚Äôm usually down thousands at this time a day.
Probably a good opportunity to dump CLOV before it gets any worse
Why?

These daily bull traps are giving me blue balls
I feel a little tiny bit bad for the people that followed Axeman in to those 450c. He had such confidence, I can see how you might have gotten swayed in to believing him if you didn‚Äôt really know what you were doing. He kept talking about ‚Äúresearch‚Äù and shit which I‚Äôm pretty sure was literally just looking at OI and being aware of the upcoming infrastructure bill.

It‚Äôs a shame he‚Äôs gonna get banned from that ban bet. Would love to see what he has to say when his ‚Äúresearch‚Äù doesn‚Äôt pan out. How could Pelosi let that happen to her calls, bro?! You said Pelosi would never let that happen!!
Theta gang bout to cut the rope again
SPY is jumping 30 cents in half a second and that seems really volatile to me. But then I realized I‚Äôm used to seeing SPY at like half this price and I‚Äôve only been trading five years. So, maybe we are overvalued haha
I can't participate in banbet. I'm already putting my money where my mouth is, so losing money and getting banned is just too much!

I know something is wrong when TSLA seems like a good play.

DIDI DIDI DIDI is back to green!!!!!!!!
That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here for
As of 2018 established figures, there were slightly more than 985,000 practicing physicians in the United States. IN TOTAL

This is roughtly 1 physician per 300 of the population.

Almost 76% of US practicing physicians were educated in the United States. Close to 25% were not.

In 2000, 57% of doctors were independent, but this decreased to 33% by 2016. Between 2012 and 2015, there was a 50% increase in the number of physicians employed by hospitals; and 26% of physicians have opted out of seeing patients with Medicaid, 15% have opted out of seeing patients with health insurance exchange plans.

At the last official published US statistic (2020): The average salary for white male physicians was $253,000 compared with $188,230 for black male physicians, $163,000 for white female physicians, and $153,000 for black female physicians.

Time to get your crayon out again

HALF these people are MILLIONAIRES ??

Your GREAT theory of over 500,000 MILLIONAIRE practicing physicians in the USA  
= **1 MILLIONAIRE doctor for every 600 US citizens**.   &lt;duh??&gt;

well why the hell not - More than 20 of every one of those doctors' patients are also millionaires too.  
\- on average

So get you BRAIN IN GEAR

So if everyone is buying puts for tomorrow should I inverse you guys and buy calls?
Probably. If you bought them cheap, you might make money by Friday. I've been thinking that we were going to see a dip yesterday and part of today. A breakout yesterday would have been very bullish for the month, but it's still choosing a direction. VIX has barely moved, and the bond yields are down. Holding puts yesterday would have been profitable, but today might be the day to sell. Probably before lunch. Maybe.

Just cause the uptrend last night was actually well-earned. It took real buying pressure to get up through 4330 on SPY, so going into a sturdy uptrend after that looks like it made 4340 the question this morning on a pullback. And now we're bouncing off it a bunch in the same manner but the buy pressure is staying just as strong. Today looks good
Theta gang day.
AMC gonna go green I feel it
Waiting for a good entry point is one of the hardest things about options trading for me. I can be so impatient and the windows are so narrow. 

Just now I‚Äôm looking at the 10/20 433p. I see SPY has spiked upwards so I go to open the trade while it‚Äôs at 3.78 per contract. By the time I get to the ‚Äúplace order‚Äù screen it‚Äôs at 4.00, so I tell myself I‚Äôm gonna wait a minute for it to get lower again. But then it goes to 4.31. Fuck! So I sit for a minute and wait and it seems like it‚Äôs not going down much lower than 4.10 or so. I buy a couple at 4.13. *Seconds* after I buy they‚Äôre at 3.95 per. 

This neuralink shit needs to hurry up and get here, if I could have just gone ‚ÄúBUY‚Äù in my head the moment I saw SPY spike up I‚Äôd already be shrek dick green on these puts

Tried to make a quick play on the volatility and went down 30% five minutes later lol. I rode it out just let myself wallow in the stupidity and the market granted me an out with a small profit. 

Time to dive in and soak up the lessons of the elders who make consistent money from the beautiful fickle mistress that is SPY.
Having a heart attack
AZPN you keep doing you
I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm looking at this trade from purely a technical standpoint. It‚Äôs oversold and I sitting at a pretty strong support level right now. It has bounced at this price level twice since March. In my opinion there is a high probability it will bounce here. I‚Äôm not looking for a 10 bagger, but you could easily make 50-100% if the trade goes as planned
Nope
Today is a day where watching futes all night actually came in handy
Haven't heard that one yet.
Wtf ta pattern is this
nah, heading to 4
Burry aint got no friends lol. Maybe Bale
Go on üëπ
Any one sitting on spy calls today is about to have a bad day
Flat
Thanks Bruh
Big tech inching back. I hope Burry and his friends get fukt
Deduction is a powerful tool
Damnit SDC you better move to $10
434 support holding strong so far this morning, but it keeps wanting to go under it. 

Hope the buying pressure hold up or else it may be going down to 432 levels
ya even tho last year was election fear but this year is OMG SEPT/OCT = BAD MONTHS SELL EVERYTHING
Coming up to an inflexion point, next 30 minutes will dictate direction for rest of day
Sold some stocks as prep for the crisis that we will see soon
What do I buy
Lmao was just thinking this. But the market is rigged so only big time investors can do day trades like that.
That's one of those big minimum wagers

Yo, fellow ber. I‚Äôll let u in on a little secret. Ur puts are fked by both theta and vega, mostly vega. Uncultured swines here call it IV crush. If u want to be a proper bear, short stuffs. Only buy puts if u think the drop is able to overcome IV. The usual FD is for retards apply for both calls n puts.
Nice, i have a few shares!
This command still work?

Why‚Äôs it selling off so much?  Can‚Äôt find any negative press on it
Kinda funny how the markets just mimicking what it did last Sept/Oct and everyone's losing their minds
Amzn looking like a heartrate monitor

They clearly are letting it go down it's just not doing circuit breakers
How long?

I knew this place has been pretty lame
Miami Spice (1986). The springboard pool scene, nuff said.
Meanwhile VIX 20 is wondering why SPY is flat!
Are you fighting a graph that goes from high left to low right???
It relates to the # of puts one month out on the S&amp;P, so overall sentiment for one month away is not super negative

That‚Äôs a very basic explanation
Bet SOFI pops as soon as everyone realizes we just consolidated the fuck out of the only mini-supports we missed last night on the indexes

Been pretty risk averse lately so I'm just glad I didn't get fucked on my one time not resisting the urge to do some retarded shit like that. The zig zag on the daily chart was just too funny to resist doing something silly

Are FB leaps free money???
It's not that I don't agree with you, but market action the past month has been a consistent decline. Fine to do that with stocks, but for options I need direction.
All up from here baby
Should TSLA expand beyond vehicles and batteries? Maybe other electronics like phones? Piss off Apple? EDIT: I'm short TSLA but wondering the potential.
How far do we see Facebook going down? And how long before it gets back above $370? Really starting to think about 1/20/23 $200 calls. A return to $370 would be around a 4K return on a 13k investment. Not bad IMO

Surprised to still see TSM being held down by idiots when everyone should know they will beat bigly like always. Idk why this is so hard for people how can TSM not beat when they literally sell out everything they make immediately and have raised their prices 20% lmfao.

Fun fact, the jump in GME yesterday was due to someone closing a single short share. They were trying to get ahead of the game but shit their pants.
Yes but they make so much fucking money. There no concrete regulator or laws for them.
Anyone think TSLA is a good deal right now (*sarcastic tone*)?

The last time the 10yr dropped below 2% was back in 1941, and it took it 18 years to get back over 3%.

The last time the 10 year treasury was above 4% was back in 2007.

The 10 year is currently still "way below" 2% currently at 1.6%.  

If you think that is high....you need a serious history lesson on interest rates.  

P.S.  Probability is high that we don't see the 10 year get above 4% for another 30 plus years from now.

They were pumps and dumps depending on your timeframe.

The guys that bought gme at 470 and amc at 80 are still very much fucked.
The guys that bought them at 4 bucks are still laughing
It's becoming really fucking clear that easy mode isnt being turned on until we finally find the real bottom

Just saw the TWNK dd and checked the short interest. If TWNK has 22M shares short and a daily volume of 1M, isn't it very easy for the stock to squeeze especially when they are breaking ATH?

Oh, good.  You can see my reply.  I was unsure if I was doing it right; people never seem to respond to my messages.  And yes, things sure are different now with these internet apps. No face-to-face meetings anymore, you know?  Of course, the pandemic has made that kind of thing difficult for me because my doctor says I am at risk.  Dr. Grene is such a nice man.  Always so patient with me, no pun intended ha ha!  He told me I need to be careful with this virus though because my lungs are not so good.  I blame my husband for being a smoker.  Of course I couldn't tell him to quit, because that was not my role, but it sure did irk me.  Staining the walls of our house, and we had kids in it for goodness sake!  Oh well.  He was a good man.  Of course, my granddaughter did try to set me up with one of those Tinders you mentioned after he passed.  Lord, my husband would have been rolling in his grave!  I told her that kind of app wasn't for me, but still she thought it would be fun to make an account.  Boy, kids sure do have a different definition of fun these days ha ha.  Anyways, I was telling her what my type was and she told me: "Granny, I think you might be gay!"  Gay!  Imagine that!  Sure I find women attractive but everyone does; they are gorgeous!  Of course I would never be a lesbian though.  Nothing wrong with it, but I would always leave room for the whole holy trinity between me and any woman. Even Anne ha ha!
yea, fuck it LMAO. good call bud, jesus christ.

Nah, they hedged yesterday already.  Max pain is 180 this week.

My father was a shoeshine boy back in the early days of Wall Street.  That is why I come here--to see what things are like now.  Boy, I tell you, the internet sure has made things different.  My father polished shoes of men like Morgan, and here I am talking to someone named origami\_asshole.  Not even capital letters.  Ho yes my father would sit at the dinner table and tell us how he used to get stock tips from the very best.  Imagine getting advice straight from the source like that!  These days everything is filtered through four different news stations and three different media--no face-to-face communication like back in the day I tell you. Of course he would only tell these stories to my brothers.  As a daughter I just had to help my mom cook and clean around the house.  I am trying more to learn about the markets now because the internet has so much to teach me.  So thanks for helping me learn more, origami\_asshole.  Maybe you can teach an old dog new tricks after all ha ha!

Bullshit. There‚Äôs no mandate to get the vaccine. You can just get tested every week.

You can freebase the coke with it. Cramer has had way too much botox, he can't snort.

When SPY hits ATH for multiple days in a row again I'm gonna call Robinhood customer service to ask them "is this the bottom of the dip? Should I buy calls?"

I already know they're gonna be like "something something financial advice blah blah blah" and then I can proceed with "so, you can't tell me if this is the bottom?" 

I'm wondering which happens first: they hang up on me or we reach some kind of answer to my question. If they actually skip the whole process and just immediately go "are you fucking retarded, go bother someone else" as soon as I ask my question, I'll buy calls
Wow! SPY almost 1/4th the way back up that giant red bloodbath slide that began @ 10:30 yesterday.

SPY, OCGN, CHPT, FSR are good and green pre market.

Others include QS, BLNK, SDC, FSR,
Just BTFD is starting to look like a fools play.  I am starting to think a much bigger dip is in play.  State of play in the SWAMP and supply chains starting to implode is not a good recipe for long tendies.  I am going into capital preservation mode.  I could be wrong though.

I remember my first time on a roller coaster. It was at the Stampede back in... oh what year would it have been... I had really wanted to take Anne and that was in the summer of grade four. I remember because we had Mrs. Brunson as a teacher. Ho man did she ever know how to wield a ruler. Back in my day, see, you weren't even allowed to be left handed. I tell you, things sure were different, but Anne was still gorgeous back then. Anyways if that was grade four the year would have been... 1953. Boy am I glad she didn't come with us, because on that roller coaster I lost my lunch. All over the shirt my mom had bought for me. I wanted off that ride too! Ha ha!

Probably not buying much, I grabbed shares and 12.50c yesterday. I don't know how high it will go but I'm grabbing more calls on the way up and puts on the way down.
In my view they probably could but then they wouldn't be the same old Fed we know and love.
$kern is in the good situation to buy, should go to $12.5 soon or late
Amazing you were able to say all that with his dick in your mouth

I think /u/cashflow_ is one of the higher quality contributors to WallStreetBets and an underrated person in general and I'm worried he's losing his mind. At one point this was supposed to be a short term dip according to him but now he acts like he really thinks jpow is going to come out one of these days and say "I won't tolerate one more minute of inflation, the treasury isn't giving out any more loans until existing debts are paid off" or some shit.

May this be your day/week ü§û
As I no longer can sleep
My calls are very weak
small dong clubbies, we love youüé∂üé∂üéµ
I woke up guys, sorry to whatever gain u see rn. At any moment it should crumble üò¢
Imagine shooting horse testosterone into your body bc you're too big of a pussy to gain muscle naturally
I‚Äôm driving my Bugatti to the Soup Kitchen. They got some hot soup waiting for us brother
Nah smoke more, then buy SDC calls. They‚Äôre practically giving them away.
Shut. The Fuck. Up
Round 2 update please
Sdc gaining big premarket
Was not expecting NFLX to stand up for Chappelle‚Ä¶ calls or puts?
Thunderdome?
Bulls acting like this isn‚Äôt going to tank in the next hour.
Yea man 459c 10/30 is a good gamble.
Heard a couple gunshots early this morning, almost called 911. Then I realized ber r fukt
Going to play dailies again. Feeling extra retarded today.

Betting oil goes up and SPY goes up in the morning.
Can anyone direct me to the soup kitchen?
Why the fuck would Apple need to borrow money. They‚Äôve got more cash than most banks.
If not premarket then by morning
SPY 450 EOW!!!, Chaz Michael Michael‚Äôs is figure skating üí™boom!!!
Who let the bulls in ?
futures at 9 dont matter either

Some emo ass shit
It‚Äôs the plunge protection squad

Lol I remember yesterday evening reading a comment from a bear saying  nothing stopping SPY from going 430 EOW. That didn‚Äôt age well. We‚Äôll back to the cave to draw 50 thousand more lines on a chart just for you to lose money. Let us know how it goes
Oooo yes I'd sell those this morning... And buy more... Lol
Nice, you jinxed it one hour before open
dang right they do :P
New harald baldr video if anyone watches him

Super cutie in the office was just talking to me and I was boring because i havent had coffee yet but hey I‚Äôm walking to get lunch with her

I was just saying your taste in stuff sucks.

You are probably like Gabe from The Office
your bull case is that people will buy homes online?

i love how retarded this sub is
literally same, probably double down market open today, what‚Äôs the worst that could happen
Sounds like an attitude problem. How bout they say ‚Äöfuck it i gotta do this no matter what‚Äò instead? ADHD is a lifestyle choice. Back in fashion. Short ADHD, long peanut allergies, dyslexia.

SPY is where it was yesterday morning.
lmao @ the bears buying puts at close yesterday

In truth, WSB is the online representation of what a perfect society in real life would look like
Can we see one of those 30$ jumps on TSLA pls, for old times sakes.
This is a nice surprise. I went to bed last night all depressed thinking I‚Äôd wake up to -2%. Good to know that bears are, and always will be, fuk.
Quack
I sold 805 weekly covered calls and about to kiss my shares goodbye
FB keeps getting crushed ü•¥
Until tesla can service my vehicle locally I can't buy them.
Hopefully we can get Facebook out of FAANG. Not worthy of being in the same league as the others.
I don‚Äôt see why you guys hate the stonk, other than it draws attention away from your stocks

Yuck bro
$OPEN will be a short term and long term winner, IMO. People will continue to buy and sell houses online
Tbh I typed this because I scrolled through my profile and saw the 2 comments about people in a car next to me smoking weed with a dog, one at 15 points, but the other one asking the reader to compare the quality of themselves as a person to someone in the car at negative 5 points. Made me lol picturing people being like "well when you brought up the stoners with the dog I thought that was cool but don't bring me into it asshole"
This premarket pump is going to fade isn't it.
We need a $450 miracle
It may not be this century or within this millennium..... but it will happen

Stupid yield, go back up!
I read it all, pretty accurate post tbh
#my 450C 10/15 aren‚Äôt fucked! Fuck yes. 450 by tomorrow or i am banned
Last I heard it was around 130k pre-orders...but, from what I can find, Mach-E pre-orders were over 40k and it looks like only about 15k were actually sold.  From what I hear, a lot of of the pre-order customers got frustrated with the dealership games.  Don't get me wrong, I am not a Tesla fanboy...more of an EV fanboy and I love the looks of the F-150 and the Rivian.  I ordered a CyberTruck because it looks one of a kind.
This cancer should have been curbed a long time ago.

You do know 80-90% of the time US markets go up right? This isn‚Äôt hang seng

Mark my words bulls, SPY WILL hit 400. It may not be today or tomorrow, or next Tuesday, or Wednesday. It may not happen next month or six months, a year from now or next 10 - 20 years, but ONE DAY, it‚Äôll happen and you will remember these words.
Spy recovers to levels not seen since. 3:40 yesterday lmao
Tbh I gotta quit smoking weed
TSLA breaking $800 ooooo shit

If you‚Äôre holding OCGN calls and don‚Äôt sell at market open, you belong here.
Yes, 1 hour before open. https://www.marketwatch.com/economy-politics/calendar
Probably doing you clovtards a favor
Really feel like yoloing my portfolio into space stonks... Feels like a good buy point, a lot of them are low atm
I sincerely thought that was the bottom üò≠
I think it's called ego mate.
You guys have plans??
Are you ducking kidding me
Imagine staying up all night watching futures when people who sleep until 9 still get to see the only numbers that matter.
I appreciate you.
Oh wait the numbers are tomorrow?
FAST earnings beat, calls gonna print.
TETHLA looking good right now
And I‚Äôll buy them again when the time is right.
#WE ARE GAY SO ASK YOUR DAD BITCH
There‚Äôs a reason ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù is a meme.
Spy $437.50 open be nice then $440‚Äôs
Bastards
Yep. Either be a little introspective when you‚Äôre wrong, or lose all your money. Those are the options and no amount of coddling oneself will change that in this game.
They can borrow money....but they have to pay more in interest to borrow. Earnings go down. Stock go down.
SPY be like 1 days for bears, 4 days for bulls
#I HEARD BEARS NEVER HAD A WOMAN AS A LOVER BEFORE

Sooo buying really cheap calls at close for spy was the play?
I just meant cuz it sucks. Like if you want to go watch a gay k drama with basically completely anonymous death, fine.

Don‚Äôt make your daughter sit there and watch it with you.

The biggest difference I‚Äôve noticed from WSB and other subreddits is that people in practically every other sub are either pseudo-intellectuals or are plain out immature, stupid, and sensitive 

WSB is for men
PROG all the way to the top. It's still cheap but not for long.
Just wanted you to know that i read first two lines
it's tomorrow, today it's:  meh?
CLOV is a dog shit stock. Pass it on
So Microsoft and Apple can‚Äôt borrow money?  What ever will they do???
Big oil will roll thru today

Ok let me give you a simple statistic. 55% of doctors in the US are millionaires. So getting an MD places you in an excellent financial position. The minimum salary for a GP in this country is basically 200-250k these days. Most engineers start around 60-80k and go up to $200k mid career. FAANG engineers start at 150k at age 22 and can go up to $500k by 30. Big law lawyers start at 220-230k at 25 with a JD and move up from there. I can give more examples but it all depends on your career. There are multiple great fields for those who want to exchange a diploma for great salary. If it‚Äôs not a MD or an engineering degree then prestige of Diploma plays a much larger part.
Are you kidding me?  I‚Äôm not spending my own money on that garbage.
I'm not sure about that, I know more living people than dead people.
Pls stop being pathetic, take the L.

Went hard into GWH calls yesterday. These things make cycles so I welcome back the merry go round of despac low float pumps.
Eww. I'm sorry.
Furries are sketch af.
Rate hikes mostly. Inflation can also really fuck over a business if its customers' buying power doesn't rise at least as fast as the business's costs.
Something I've noticed as someone who calls out people's shit a lot:

In other subreddits, if I type a comment that kinda calls out the reader's bullshit but mostly the comment is just funny, then it gets upvotes because people refuse to admit it's calling out their bullshit and they just read it like it's talking about everyone else, not them. But when you really call out their bullshit, like aggressively, like "yeah YOU with the yellow shirt I'm talking to you" so they can't just pretend it's not directed at them anymore, they downvote you to shit.

This sub is more consistent. Unless you use the art of subtlety to the fullest degree, you'll just get downvoted to shit on any comment that calls the reader out on their bullshit, no matter how benign or humorous of a post it is.

This is because when your money relies on you not being wrong about shit, you can't just go through life believing whatever delusion is most convenient for your feefees all the time, so it gets harder to just pretend what you're reading is about everyone else and doesn't apply to you.There are actually a lot of differences between wsb and the rest of reddit that can be explained by this same fundamental difference in capacity for delusion connected to the psychological dynamics of gambling. 

Anyway, what I'm saying is, SPY 420 is a meme you fuckin retard bears
I was told these puts would print‚Ä¶
If you can't answer simple questions on your own with Google, you should probably quit this game right now.

Ok snowflake
Today‚Äôs the day for SDC to get rolling
For real - WTF! Watching them all night and they‚Äôve totally flipped again. Damn futures need to knock it off
I apologize, as a permabull, for saying the stupid shit I said last night about taking off my bull costume. It was out of character and clearly a lapse of judgement.

I bet in a few years it'll come out that more than half of Facebook is dead accounts and bots. They have been overcharging small business for advertising based off of cooked numbers. Marketing is the easiest business to scam others.

Agree that she will see as a compliment and will likely tell you everything. I don‚Äôt think I would tell her you want to know her routine so you can do it. I‚Äôm an older dude and the only skin routine I use is soap and water. My generation is a bit different than some of the younger guys. Growing up, if we talked about skin care, you could guarantee an ass whooping and endless ridicule. We were proud of our scars, tans, chest hair, callouses and skin blemishes. Chicks seemed to dig those qualities about us. Now guys have to be moisturized, body shaved, manicured and pedicured, man bun and willing to share their emotions every chance they get. Plus they need safe spaces. We only needed safe spaces if we moisturized, shaved our bodies, had man buns or excessively shared our feelings. Not saying there‚Äôs anything wrong with taking care of yourself or having emotions. I‚Äôm just fascinated by how much things have changed since I was in my late teens and twenties. It‚Äôs a different world.
500 more PROG at open
FB is a buy at $250
this market is going to go down at open. i hate being a silly gay bear but i am this week
I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this but literally all of us will die one day. Everyone on planet earth, no matter how rich or poor or healthy or lucky you are, will die.

Not hidden, but everything about cereals was supposed to be part of a balanced breakfast and be good for you. Where in all actuality most cereals have a higher glycemic index than pure sugar. Nothing like starting your day by rocketing your blood sugar into the stratosphere.
Actually I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre really differing in our opinion I think we just gave two facets of differing arguments. I agree that the US is filled with morons. I was just saying the idea that you can‚Äôt get rich of your intellect/education is not true. This nation has the best higher education in the world period. K-12 education is beyond terrible because we want to hand out participation trophies and we push kids into doing things they want instead of fields the world needs. It‚Äôs why Asians, Jews and immigrants in general dominate the countries average income list. They were bred in their home countries to value education and hard work and they bring those values here. The top kids in this country are incredible they manage to place at the top in international math olympiads and science fairs year after year. And yet our countries average competency in math and science is below average. We have an intellectual gap more so than even a wealth gap and it‚Äôs driven by various cultures and individuals valuing different things which is fine but the issue is their is no unifying strong baseline for public education which drops the average down. The minimum bar needs to be set much higher like it is in most Asian countries so kids can be prepared for this globalized world. Hillbillies are complaining about jobs being outsourced but that WILL be the case and there is nothing anyone can do to stop that except adapt and move forward to be able to compete with foreign talent
Because it will cost more in interest for corporations to borrow money. And that reduces earnings. Tard

Dude - these are not my statistics, they are your government's.. Especially the 1, 2, 3 statistically most common ways of attaining personal wealth in the USA struck me as being PARTICULARLY AMUSING .. given that this was a nationawide survey by the **US Board of Education** to assess to what extent 20 years of REFORMS had affected the US educational system - THEIR CONCLUSION was "not at all".They themselves point out in the preamble that they were forced to chose income and private wealth as the only STANDARD of judgement that could be applied to all citizens as they could find NO OTHER manner of judgement nationwide.

Personally I dnt give a frag if you're all dumb as bricks (and maybe I am too).. but before you knee jerk you could look up in A FEW FRAGGING MINUTES the standards ancd statistics, they are publicly available to anyone interested or anyone with the HALF-FUNCTIONING brain needed to do the research themselves.

The obvious conclusion is that on-the-job education and on-the-job selection will get an employer what they want, and that any educational certificate is simply (statistically) a statement that you can more or less read and write and have some vague idea about what the fuck job you are applying for.  Your studies will not radically alter your IQ or your family background, seems those things are more important than any university degree or diploma. Unfortunately for all the money your taxpayers have poured into the system

(IMO less now than previously, of course, because the USA finds elitism and priveledge MUCH more acceptable than it did 50 years ago. Nepotism, contacts, deals, and just straight bullshitting gets you the job. And thats the only statement here I'm making myself IMO, the rest is your government's opinion about the measurable effectiveness of education)

Naturally some people are smarter than others, but the US board of Education STATES that UNFORTUNATELY the US educational system does not advance or adapt students to deal BETTER with their chosen carreer path in ANY WAY that the Board of Education can DETECT.

Have you got it? - this is THEIR conclusion, NOT mine (I dont give a rats fart) - look up the report and read it for yourself, look at educational statistics and comparisons or standards in developed countries. - they are EASY to find - or do you want me to point you in the same fucking direction AGAIN &lt;good fucking grief&gt;.

Do it for yourself, that is one of the things education is supposed to train you to be ABLE to do, aint it? - exept apparently not much in the USA?

This is NOT my problem.. you state the typical USA's fantasy about itself, and the USA can't be FUCKED to find out the truth or FACE it. Your educational standards are nationally and internationally LOW. Go **check** and stop ranting. Argue with the board of education about it, not me.

For myself, it just made me laugh to read it.

People with ADHD don‚Äôt produce enough dopamine in their brain so what ends up happening is that dopamine is only released at normal/higher levels when the task is stimulating or personally intriguing to the individual. However, because people with ADHD don‚Äôt produce enough dopamine in their brain what ends up happening is that it‚Äôs *harder* for them to do boring tasks that people without adhd might also find boring but are able to do. It‚Äôs hard to explain, it‚Äôs like there is a wall that prevents you from doing something until last minute. What stimulants do is pump more dopamine in the brain for people with ADHD so it ‚Äúlevels‚Äù them out which is why on it you can be more productive

Oh yeah it does!  I also remember it dropping like a hot knife when EUA was delayed in the US.
They might not weight GPA as heavily if you‚Äôre 40 but it still matters. You should be aiming for a 720+ GMAT if you‚Äôre white or Asian to be blunt. Average age of incoming students is 27-28 so 40‚Äôs is on the older side so I wouldn‚Äôt get your hopes up. For example I think last years class the oldest student at Columbia business school was 43. So def not impossible but the odds are skewed. I‚Äôm terms of work experience they‚Äôre looking for ‚ÄúWow‚Äù factor jobs. Military experience is a huge plus or some other sort of volunteering like americorps or Peace Corps. If you worked at a Big Tech company like FAANG. If you started your own company. If you were an Olympian or professional athlete and looking to make a switch. If you worked at an MBB consulting firm or Bulge bracket bank. Those type of things all help tremendously. Otherwise if the work experience is mediocre or quite run off the mill it‚Äôs going to be hard to catch their eye. Best you can do is crush the GMAT and hope you can get in. Honestly if you‚Äôre in your 40‚Äôs I would do what my dad did when he was your age and get your company to pay the tuition for a part time MBA at your state school. My dad took his time got his MBA in 4-5 years while working full time and took a upper management position afterward.

not really, it's just how October moves.  2nd half of Oct is generally more stable.  Look at October last year.
The market is a master of reverse psychology. Low at closing yesterday should be bearish for today, but nope. 

I think the selling into close might have been people worried about what the bond market was going to do after its day off. I'd ignore the futures for now but worthwhile keeping an eye on bond yields today before yolo'ing into a growth stock.

No I mean an M7 MBA basically tells you the employee is a smart mofo who got a pretty high GMAT and GPA in undergrad at a minimum and has some other impressive accolades. They‚Äôre not picking some random kid down the street to go to HBS lol. You‚Äôll know you have an intelligent hardworking employee who you can trust with higher managerial duties if you‚Äôre trying to take some work off your shoulders. My friend just graduated out of Wharton a few years back and now he‚Äôs a COO of a small hospital. The CEO is much older but trusts him over some older guys lower down the ladder. You don‚Äôt learn anything necessarily at the school but having that badge of prestige basically tells everyone you‚Äôre smart af to get their in the first place. Law school is very similar.

USA is world famous for having one of the worst educational systems in the developed world.. other countries send experts for 30 years to try to figure out all the ways the US is fucking it up so totally badly. I think America ranks about 15th down from the top in the western world.

The US Board of Education nationwide survey found ZERO correlation between educational qualifications and financial success, social standing, extraordinary acheivement or personal income.

In order of frequency, the Board found that the top three ways to gain wealth (an accepted marker of success) in the USA are :

1 - Be born wealthy  
2 - Marry someone wealthy  
3 - Organized crime

All other paths to financial success are statistically insignificant. Education and status are not related. There is zero statistical correlation between educational qualification and subsequent personal achievement. .. This is according to the Board. - They made the survey - it was their conclusion.

An MBA outside of the M7 schools is utterly useless and only worth pursuing if your company covers the cost entirely. M7 schools are worth paying for due to their strong alumni connections. If you‚Äôre going for an MBA for technical skill you‚Äôre in the wrong place, middle management doesn‚Äôt require much technical skill after a certain point

Pct.  Have tech to recycle many types of plastics, which currently can't be done for like 80% of plastic waste. Many consumer brands want to go green and essentially want to have 100% of their packages from recycled materials in the future.  Pct already has deals with major brands like L'Oreal, nestle, etc. to supply them with virgin plastic resins from recycled plastic for many years. Hold until 2030s.
Market so fake, tempting you to get in just so it can whiplash the other way, then right back the other way after stopping you out, then again &amp; again.. etc..
How to actually make money on WSB:
1. Wait for everyone to start talking about a ticker
2. Wait for day two (sometimes day three) of the pump, look for the first real price rejection normally at a pretty obvious resistance line. 
3. Buy puts and short shares
4. Go back to step 1 with the next pumped ticker

Case studies:
CLOV
SDC
LCID
WISH
TMC
MVIS
And so, so many more.

You guys are getting paid?
This guy just trying to get banned
very sinister
You made a really short custom ban bet (None) which was not accepted.
Don't put any text after the time token (1m, 1w, 15d) if you don't intend to carry out an interesting punishment to get unbanned early.
You should feel a little better now.

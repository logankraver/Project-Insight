Holy shit the slaughter that would be
Huge Green day for BB 

Lolz
Records Record Records
In simple terms, I have to somehow tell the kids daddy lost the house lmao.
Tsla 1400c
This has to be the dumbest thing I’ve ever read “the option price isn’t related to the stock price”. The movement of the price of the stock up or down has a direct, though not equal, effect on the price of the option. As the price of a stock rises, the more likely it is that the price of a call option will rise and the price of a put option will fall

Funny you’d call me an ape with the mark of shame you have for flair
👃🏻👃🏻👃🏻. It smell like 🏳️‍🌈🐻💩 in here.
I didn’t try to short DWAC, but I would have gone long if I had seen the notice.
That explains why it’s over heating
Calls on sale rn though 🤔
IBKR maybe? They are called international brokers idk
If my 11/19 SPY &amp; NET puts don't print, I will only buy calls for the rest of my life
I’m thinking 1230 eod tomorrow
Biden is a far better and far less embarrassing president no doubt lmao
Is this a fairly quickly like sending kami to fix the border fairly quickly?
Tesla isn’t worth 1.5T
One of my puts should print: ATVI, APPS, COUR

Here comes the power minute
#it is over move on
What % of retail investors have no clue there is a fed meeting tomorrow?
i need apps to pull a chgg today
Annnnnd pencils DOWN
OCGN gonna fucking RIP in after hours
Just quick in and out? I decided to hold my 11/12 and 11/19 and see what happens tomorrow
I’m gonna laugh if we pump after the taper announcement and CNBC is like 

“*the market seems to find the taper timeline favorable, not too shocking and likely to contain inflation woes”*
Time for popcorn stock earnings! No positions but I wanna see if she can fly with movies back in theaters.
hahahahahahahaahahahahhahahaha
One day all of Amazon cars/trucks will be Rivian
No.  It’s zero.
Don't really see the point in trying to time it, I'd rather just ride it out for the next 10 years and add when I can
Probably on platform shoes!  Have to watch for that tonight!
TEVA PFE WISH juicy earnings play
If Tesla is worth 1.5t then msft is worth 5t

Holy fuck I’m crying lmaoooo
Hey you

We're on the same team for once....

Fuck.. this better not be like sdc. I will find you and strangle you. : D
My calls are down 57% 😑
Sometimes I feel like the market might be rigged against the little guy
Damn. Should’ve brought at low. Fml.
Now that everyone is wanting to do something like a Metaverse, I’m convinced Earth is just a Metaverse someone bought off of Wish.

how fast can you buy QCOM calls?
Chgg calls
But you wanna see a braindead puppet talking absolute mumblings of random words on the front page? 😂 whole world’s laughing now more than ever, embarrassing they were our only options and people didn’t want a better 3rd option
Before earnings? You’re brave.
SOFI blood red all day... is it going to close up 1 cent?
Before the Fed, totally normal
"Hedge funds start to feel the pain of interest gyrations."..what I am reading on biz news screen....rising short term interest causing this.
Bruh, I'm hung like a horse and have blown out hundreds of prime vagoos.
Got so lucky with 11/05 OCGN calls today. No chance I was holding overnight.
Spy to zero
Not losing money
Does anyone know of a stock trading app that international users can trade on? webull and RH are a no go.
Msft flight to safety

MY GOD THAT'S OCUGEN'S MUSIC I'M HEARING
Thoughts on Rivian?
What kinda limp dick power hr was that
I cant wait until the bottom falls out of TSLA lol. So many people are going to get clapped. going to be 20 days tomorrow since the 10EMA has been hit. Eventually the bottom falls out.
hope y’all bought the OCGN dip
welp, at least I only bought a call on tsla that was worth $200. In any case I'm not going to lose much.
Just bought 11/5 89c. See you on the other side old sport
Opened a *teensy* 1dte QQQ put position as a hedge
i mean...im buying puts on SPY &amp; Z so does that count?
The bottom..so far
What if big money knows that massive inflation is coming, which is why Tesla is a buy at $1 trillion... because they know that 10 years from now, $1 trillion will be worth like 6 loaves of bread?
About to get an ER BEAT
VXX calls it is
if you are long TSLA its def time to sell for a while right
In our dreams
Probably a market maker unloading their shorts after someone closed puts. The options side of this has been brutal to put holders today.

$HOOD is Jon Jones of stock market. No matter how hard you want to see him lose for all the horrible things he’s done, he’s still gonna rise from the ashes.

Picked up a few shares today.
My Tesla calls 😭😭
&gt; You can’t retire on the 15 shares you threw your change at.
This all feels like a massive trap lmao
And mountains that are way less awesome than Colorado or Utah…otherwise accurate as fuck.
Who in there right mind is buying here? “Oh! I have to get in before the fed meeting!”
These will print hard
Long hold on BB is my 10 bagger (first bought in at $6)
Wait you mean I can’t retire on the 15 shares I threw my change at?
Paperhands
If you ain’t buyin CAR what the fuck is you doin???

Was hoping for a last min rip instead of a last min dump, but my stocks are green, that’s all that matters.

I didn’t know Cramer is only 5’6”
It’s a complicated topic. It’ll be fun.
Future growth is limited, and "smashing earnings" is a perspective setup by carefully worded releases on stock analysts who don't want to hurt their accuracy ratio by going too high rather than too low.

what the fuck is going on with Roku? Constantly smashes earnings, yet the stock keeps tanking right after. Ironically, this time it didn't pump as much before earnings report, which makes me think it might be a good buy now.

Only good words

#BAGHOLDER SPOTTED.
No politics here, I mean there’s no substance to the company, no good catalysts, no reason for it to pump back to 17.5x SPAC price. There’s no social network, no revenue, nothing. At least with nonsense like AMC/GME etc they actually have businesses and revenue. DWAC is entirely speculation and there’s nothing happening there.

Bruh, first time I've ever seen somebody cry over $100. Fuck outta here with that weak shit.
OCGN already pumping, place your bets boys
Even if they lose 10k each property, that’s only a 100million dollar loss. They’re down 10% today on their market cap, they their value dropped by around 2-3 billion. 

That seems to our weight a 100mil loss. Just estimating.
CHGG CEO says he's only 75% penetrated lol..  learn to take it all man!
so how many you fuckers bought CAR 450+?

That’s false. To most novice retail investors, (which this sub is) basic share price is one of the first things to be taken into account.

You must take into account what others will think as well when investing. Psychology is a major factor in trading and investing. To understand if a stocks share price is too high to a novices eyes can determine whether or not there is an upside or downside to a stock short or long term.

Trading is not purely quantitative data, math, or fundamentals. A great degree relies on psychology, social patterns, and other factors.
Not very quietly. Have you seen the share price today
An insane amount of puts
It wouldn't be the main driver. It would mainly spook the retail into closing out in a postion after the dip.
Gotcha. Well good luck.
Ass lips
Time travelers please let me know
they deserve it for pricing out home buyers. rot and burn
It’s been dropping like a rock off some bad PR, but it all comes down to their main drug moving to third trials with good results, and if coming to market this thing is going to moon

Alright SPY, 15 minutes left. Time to dump.

yeah I know everyone laughed at my Gandalf Pez dispenser last time I Zoomed, little do they know I eat with Gimli
Congrats and F U.
It's very possible that announcing taper will begin in December rather than november would be seen as bullish. Imagine if jpow puts it off until January 🥵

Also could be seen as bullish if the taper amount is less than the previously announced 15 billion per month reduction
So calls or puts?
Su Bae printing right now

God I can’t wait for NET earnings
SPY breaking $462 or nah?
Elon, no! Don't do it!
show some CAR gain porn pls
Chegg is fucked
🤦🏻‍♂️ buying puts on an already leveraged product is just wasting money on premiums, you do you tho
TSLA really going green eod huh?
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/samsnyder23 (0/1) made a bet that CLOV would go to 6.66 when it was 7.4 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
kinda wierd sitting in one of my finance class and listening to my prof talk about options, i feel as if i can teach this chapter given my time on wsb. fuck’n nerd
TSLA green today?
Everyone knows biden is the worst president ever, it's just the slavemaster says u have to love him and do everything cnn says
Fuck it I'm holding all my calls. No I never learn
Because that's the monthly expiration date. Those were written a long time ago
Somebody just remembered TSLA doesn't need a reason to pump.
I hear you, but if there wasn’t value in institutional money there wouldn’t have been a split to get the float S&amp;P eligible  for inclusion last year.

As stated previously, the results you speak to are a result of the company’s execution playing out in the qtrly units shipped, the gross margin/unit, and the financials, which, once yet again, the Street, and not the retail investor, is finally catching onto, which is driving this stratospheric multiple expansion.

Retail doesn’t have $400B of capital to deploy in a day. Congrats to the hodlers who stuck through the dark/scary times, but this is no longer their show and really hasn’t been since about 2019.

Trust.
maybe you should read why DELL price fell ya nob.
People are thumbing down because of the news Elon. Saying hertz deal hasn't been signed yet.

There is a bear that’s legit going to commit seppuku when we don’t have a -3% day tomorrow
it is, especially given management's authorization of a buyback program amounting to 22% of market cap.

Notice the media yesterday as a WHOLE did not emphasize TSLA stock performance/run rather fixated on Elon's wealth and how much he made in a day. 

Today a recall that can be fixed via OTA and some miscommunication on the Hertz situation, the rattlesnake media is all over this "supposed" bad news. 

This shit is becoming predictable
I'm holding GME though it, but if you feel overleveraged, deleverage.

Seen it happen before many times actually. Actually more times than not as of recently it’s been lifting up the market as opposed to killing it
I bought $120c Nov 14 on AMD when it was at $99 in October, I sold when it hit $106 lol
EVCM is nearing the end of its lockup period and should explode shortly after. No options available but it’s below $20 and imho a steal.
Lfg, I have a 11/5 1240c 🚀🚀🚀
most of the people on this sub lol
Here’s the problem, yes the market cap is is illogical, but where else are people going to put their money retail investors and also large investors are throwing in the towel and just hopping on for the ride,  it’s gone up so much and the company and brand just becomes more popular as the weeks go by. They have not even opened up the two new fancy factories. Not saying that justifies the cap, just it’s going to be a motivator. 

I sold and I have loads of cash now thanks to Tesla but I’m bored with this market. Nothing has been more exciting that Tesla. Bought the March dippy dips knowing later it would just do it’s thing and here we are. I don’t now man, it’s not logical, but what other stock is gonna do that for me ?
No fear of the Fed, the one thing that could crash this party. After high inflation readings and everything. No fear. lol Brave or stupid, or smart.
No fucking shit
more like run to 458
AMC earnings for sure gonna be priced in. Might get nasty AH
Tsla green by eod
Just pick the dumbest, most unlikely thing
Yeah I mean it was done earlier. Sold now for a small profit.

Made some big mistakes today but somehow find myself up 3.8k
Mostly calls cuz they have earnings soon

I'm stuck holding tesla because I don't want to pay taxes on my 80k gain. Sucks cause I know a correction is coming....but I think the value of the stock after the correction with still be more than if I sold at these numbers and pay taxes.
Fucked up hard today

I’m referring to share price, my bad for not detailing that.

Hush bby this is the blow off top. Ride SPY to $475 and then get your puts ready. But not before then

i bought 1170c 11/5 20 minutes ago for 33.00 and I am up 1000$

edit - sold up 880$ this is too much for my heart lol
I dunno, I remember this one time at band camp a company called NovaStar Financial caught a bid
ohhh ok, interesting. from my experience briefly working marketing for pharma mfg, india likes to do things real cheap so i could see this going through over there. fingers crossed, good luck to us

TSLA: “LMAO fuck you dumb bears, eat my ass”
Hold up.. Dick Cheney is still alive?
About to yolo into etsy puts 😬
You can't short those before anyway , TD is shit for shorters , only thing you can short is blue chips (except TSLA) or stocks with high float. You couldn't short TSLA even before it 10x on TD since it's its 24/7 HTB.

I just googled and apparently you have to message/call them with a min 100k account to short HTB stocks and HTB desk don't work AH so ToS is literally dogshit for shorters. Pro shorters use TradeZero
Don’t get my hopes up

Tsla and gme need to fuck already and get this party started.
Hard to tell, it was being covered so it is either $40 or $80 EOW. No news etc.
Huh
Damn I sold too early
$66.99
Yes I bought it when it was under $1 and sold when it pumped to $4. But knew it was a pump and dump and would drop right off a cliff
Dear god almost positive from buying dips. Tsla keep going bby
You should give calendar spreads a try on it and sell weeklies to these tards.

Looking forward to all the salty "apes are rich but they still suck" comments
The price action seems to indicate this expectation.  I find it suspect.
RIOT you fucking beautiful bastard keep going and catch up to your sister MARA. WE BELIEVE
Lol that shit is more of a roller coaster than the corn is. Bear put spreads seem like a good option, though.

I was told here by a few on oct 25 that it's a bad call because they tank after earnings but yet here i am listening to u/axemanfromMa like a clown
ITs a great company!!! And it will be good to all those who HOLD STRONG... HOLD LONG and they will GET REWARDED!!!
Spy 463+ EOD mark my words.

 i wouldnt mind it drop just a bit down for more calls.
Theta will probably cost about that each day until expiry. Who knows, though, TSLA is completely divorced from reality at this point.
When
BBBY. Undervalued and over shorted
Can we all agree that CAR pumping over 100% after the Hertz ordeal today is the funniest thing ever?
The Coinbase phone app is worth more than the largest aerospace and defense company LMT right now. Let that sink in for a moment. Citadel had a massive stake in LMT too.

Edit: referring to share price
Is the SAVA run over? Or just a little rest for now.
What’s pumpin what’s dumpin
WISH bagholders
Oh boy here come the DWACkos 😒
Never call the top in a bulls market
Hey TSLA pls die real quick so I can close these spy puts plz

They spread this hysteria, because there is a lot of money to be made by peddling lies.

Just look at Greta Thunberg, who has made millions by preaching that the world is going to end unless all industrialized countries, excluding China and India of course, lower their Co2 output.

Everyone asking about JPOW.

He's already said printing stops in 2022. Tomorrow he'll just put a date on it.
Infrastructure already passed the Senate.  As soon as the House votes it through it's ready to be signed into law.

The Build Back Better bill hasn't passed the Senate, and is what has tied up the passing of infrastructure in the House.  House progressives have previously stated that they wanted to vote on infrastructure and BBB together, and have been waiting on Manchin / Sinema to get on board with BBB before they'd give a yes vote in the House.

But this week they've reversed, and stated that they'll move forward without assurances from Manchin / Sinema and let Schumer and Biden deal with them.  They're going to vote through infrastructure and the BBB as soon as they have language finalized on their version of the BBB.
U probs rite

up 8%
Bought calls when it dipped under $140 two weeks ago on the Politico smear. Just cashed out for 200% profit. Hanging on to my commons and selling CCs. NVAX has been good to me.
There will be a huge bond sell off/yield spike if they don't announce taper. Which likely brings market down anyway.

Right now 10yr is contained because they expect a taper.
Is it good time to buy Chegg?

&gt; ATVI is up 50% in the past year. It has a market cap of $32B and pays an annual dividend yield of 2.3%. I don't think it will come down much more, but you never know what could happen with this volatile sector
It's literally tanking atm.
climate scientist are buying up all the properties that are close to coastlines in hopes the properties will soon become beach-fronts, that is the only reason they’re warning us of global warming is so they could make it happen so that they have beachfront properties for a discount, smh
Sold it 850 yesterday, bot back this morning for 280. Been bouncing around 450/500 all day. Can’t mess around with this beast. But during that short cover on close, it was time. 🍻
They’ve had an identical chart for months
Name a worse stock than $PYPL, you can’t- wait never mind, I can. $DIS

ATVI’s gonna come down some more.. right? 🌈
So I guess SPY is just never going to go down again huh
The $12c 11/5 bought last week at $9 in anticipation of this week, if it gets approval moon is the word on the street

Taking profits is taking profits, no matter how small. Sometimes you’re just going to need to be satisfied with a 5% profit. But if you’ve got months or even weeks left before your expiration it’s worth riding it out a lot of the time. I normally sell the week before expiration. You’ll get a feel for leaps over time, it’s different than FD’s for sure.
Is SNDL dead for good?. Lot of short interest!

ASTS about to go off
Will my December 3 47 dkng calls be okay. I got 45 contracts and I need 50 to be guaranteed in the money through expiry. I feel like I tend to paper hand calls too soon so I’m inclined to stick it out but wanna get your thoughts. My account is about 50% leveraged into these calls
hopefully it spikes again tomorrow so i can offload my stupid calls i fomo'd into today
There's the big SAVA steaming shit in my ear

What's the move for TMUS earnings
Missed out on a few % gains on my tesla calls, but I still sold for +40% this morning. Looked pretty clear from the chart that it'd be flat all day, wasn't about to let Theta fuck me today.
I am once again asking to be lucky with the $3500 I put in OCGN calls

Lol how much was the contract?

yep, 35s should print due to initiation of chgg buyback, which was announced during the earnings call. 

$1 billion in buyback on a 5 bil market cap. they have a lot of cash / investments to liquidate before they can begin
Need a good gme run to pump the rest of these dumbass meme stocks. I'd love a 7 figure tax bill.
The run was a pure gamma squeeze. Once they pop it’s over. Expect it to retrace and accelerate into the week as the OTM call deltas fade.
Like this if you cry every time 🥲
it's not like a traditional stock, everyone knows it could suddenly start pumping again, pointing down or not.

SoFi going to kill earnings, look at LC 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I swear I would pay to watch a reaction live stream of the daily.

lol, 11/19 will be my holding period
Good call my guy
Company gets a deal to distribute and sell vaccine in USA and Canada only, take 51% of the sales and apes get happy and hard for WHO approval. Tf?

I understand Chinese. Its about the King Emperor trying to kill his little brother as they used to compete.... and the little brother made this poem wondering why brothers need to kill each other.....

but why did Elon Musk post this?
1000 put two weeks out. Problem is 1 contract more than a grand.
I thought that was Dick Chaney.
What is going on with SAVA? It's going wild.
when Ps5 is back in stock i'm buying it from Best Buy just to out of smite
POWER HOUR CMON LCID AND TSLA
Will print
If it gets its approval it will not be.
Wut didnt i read? You said we shouldnt trust the Fed and that the markets were greedy and autistic. I am telling you thats not the case and there is rational reasons why the market is where its at rn
Bought one zillow call so congrats put holders
they actually expanded paying users y/y, market really did not like the enrollment forecast, as you mentioned
When tomorrow?
Anyone doing Etsy earnings?
Mine too brother
Haha brave or risky but either way I like to think fortune favors the bold 🤌🏽
I hope so. I don't really want to hold it long-term
Kathie, you little slut you. Keep them glasses on for me when I go visit you.
Thoughts on Cenovus (oil) earnings? Canadian oil company priced stupidly low.
Yes
So sour hour into tapering ?
Earnings report this week with the anticipation for an update on the phase 3 trial and any results

Cant wait for FSR earnings today.  time to grab the dildo for the shorts!
Grabbed FCEL $9 puts sell down into close

So that'd be a change of subject.  Next you'll be telling me a client list is a moat.  I'm tempted to short the fucker just to shut you up
Thanks brah ! Right back at you !
I almost bought in at $20. Almost ;(
Hard to feel too bad for him. Goes through the trouble of kidnapping, killing and driving to a remote location, then didn't even bury the body. At least push the car off a cliff or something, don't just leave it out for people to find. It's like he wanted to get caught.

He is hinting that you can't day trade with only 500 bucks. And he is correct.

So start out with a swing trade. Trade to hold for a couple days. It's a better trading strategy anyway.
AMC looks ready to breakout
Good for you. Now put that money to work and see a real return.
Petition to ban $CAR DD this week. Too much DD posted on stocks who have already run up which makes it worthless.
CHGG calls anyone ?
WSB doesn’t buy goofy stocks. 

They buy shit that pops 50% on the day.
I hope it works for you bud, I really do 🤞
whos buying calls in this market?
At this point, if musk got run over by a tesla semi and met his creator, the stock would still probably rocket anyway, because people would argue it proves the semi is real.
Glad the trump stock is up about 5%
this is a bad strategy
GME is about to go ape shit
Why did SAVA spike?  I see no news on it.
[deleted]
Visa chopped my balls off
Tesla call before close? or the run is over
Lmaooo facts , a lil late but I think there’s still some space to grow
blew away financial targets, low cost basis in their fleet, high return on invested capital

and short covering, very thinly traded stock
Whichever has the lower IV, meaning cheaper premiums.
they're like a parasite that's feasting on google images

Low enrollment numbers on the earnings, but more so looking at tomorrow's fed call/haircut being the reason
DWAC calls it is
Got out of NET, S, and ASAN today for solid gains. Let’s see how tomorrow rolls
I’m in for 100 shares at 15.03 average.
I told u to hold it!

This stock has soooo much more room to run.

It will hit its highs again, esp with the approval on the way!
so is OCGN just a pump n dump?
Bought z 70p and 75p - please chegg this bitch for earnings

Chegg is for cheaters
Come on GME, let's go!

Yes. Combine it with amphetamines and it's like having your $20 Save $63c go to $1,000 within an hour
get your head in the GME!
I went from 11 to 13 pro and it’s the same phone.
Nice bro. Not like it’s been on a 3 month tear or anything.
Big day tom. Don’t you worry. It’ll run up in the final hour and they’ll print tomorrow.
I ~~hope~~ **demand** we have a power hour
WHATS THE NEWS
You'd probably make more inversing Cramer than following his recommendations. A few months ago someone called in asking about Pinterest, and he gave it a ringing endorsement. I remember sitting there, like, "who the fuck would put a dollar in *Pinterest*?" Down 1/3 in the last 6 months.
**Discipline check:** 

You are down 27% on your weeklies and you want to use your last day trade to paper hand like a little **bitch**. Don't do it.

You were confident in your trade, so hold and grow some hair on your balls.
[deleted]
I’m thinking that the market continues its march upwards until Q3 results start tapering out. I’m seeing SPY 466 before any correction. Bulls still control the market rn
you are wrong today though, no need to remind you tomorrow. Today was green and literally only green. I have puts but unlikely tomorrow pays out.
*I got 99 problems and an answer key ain't one*
FB one step up and five steps back
Infrastructure is finally going to pass the house.  X is the play.  

Get your options while they're cheap!
OCGN if you like to gamble, tomorrow’s either gonna be a great rush or a massive bummer, who’s in :)
Tesla with the shrekkkkkk
Need more rckt fuel
Any yolo''s before market close?

SAVA out of steam. Next meme please.
TSLA what you doing bae?
Wow look at that green candle  in TSLA. WTF happened??
23 year old just YOLO my 8k savings into two Tesla 1195c expiring Friday , all or nothing for me 🌀
What happened to holding 210
To be perfectly honest you guys buy some goofy ass stocks, there I said it.
Fuck Tesla keep going I’m only down 70% now
SQQQ calls/SPY puts
I bought 2 SAVA 50 leaps based on that extremely autistic DD. Thank you brother.
Finally bought my first GME
I'd rather fomo into ocgn than that trash
Also nvax mooning this week. Easy 220 target
How is car still at 350
They’ve been available while SQ went up.
Hype about the loopring thing
[deleted]
CLOV is the worst meme stonk. Doesnt even moon w GME or AMC 😂😂😂
RIOT 30c 11/19 bought this morning are up 55% should I double down?
Any of you autist go from 12 pro or max to 13 pro?? If so, is it worth? I like that 120hz refresh and would like to go w small pro again
Woah, hey there TSLA
Lol that shriek sick on Tesla
Quit your job
the ole tuck n zuck!
Tsla is getting excited PH
Down 190k on LCID lmao
Cramer straight up murdering his fans with that Zillow recommendation a while back lmao
🐻 gang— weeklies on VXX calls or SPY poots?
It's 208 a second ago you said 210 going up to 250

Edit: now 207

Yeah but she doesnt let me do that very often
Remind me tomorrow?
Give it to them papi
Which he probably was, like he's done before. I don't personally know the guy, but he certainly sounds like he has a hard time understanding why he can't make some comments (that would be also compatible with his Aspergers diagnosis). I also strongly suspect he's also Bipolar, so it would be even harder for him to self moderate.
Announcement today ?
Tesla decided to play now
They are meem stocks... what you expect. Gotta learn to take small profits on the rips and don't chase
I keep missing all the squeezes because of work, can’t be on my phone 24/7 🤦‍♂️
I'm up 20k rn on gme calls I bought at open but on
The Fed has distorted beyond any recognition
Can’t realize gains if there is nobody there to buy your contracts so most likely not
What lost money you talkin about?
Sava
ya that was kinda crazy. cheggs overpriced but that seems like a bit of an overreaction?
kids these days don’t even know who george clooney is.

he shot brad pitt for christ’s sake!
i love that everyone here hates him, I used to work hedges and Citadel was our client and he's an awful, insufferable prick. just absolutely miserable to be around, I wish him nothing but the worst.
Dude imagine traveling back to the 50s and DCAing everything until now!!!

That strategy is just as relevant and what you posted
I still dont know what Pinterest does. Aren't they just an inferior version of Google images?
nah it just started phase 3 trails it will take a while and i already googeld and didnt find shit thats why i ask

UK doesn't allow options ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Told you guys you would be fomoing into GME by Friday!

Stop being haters and jump on! This rocket is primed for 300!
it was mentioned as a risk in september, but there were buy recommendations despite that. 

a weird day for sure.
Banging your mom

You’re a dirty greedy little piggy, aren’t you? Little pig boy comes from the dirt.

Yep already sold it for profit. I have a 130c for January I’m going to let ride
Any news on GME?  Why is it mooning?
[deleted]
Dateline
hope ur not saying 100%+ IV is low…but best of luck i hope u print
Why GME mooning?
SOFI, PYPL, ADP, MindBody which got taken private a couple years ago, hell even SHOP
Thanks. One more thing—what’s your policy when it comes to taking profit on options? do you try to hold till closer to the exp date or just take profits when there’s a decent surge?
I read somewhere that Pfizer might have invested in it. I think it was hidden somewhere in Pfizer’s Q3 earnings results
Underpromise, overdeliver jesus. You guys promise everything and end up never delivering.

Holy shit I stopped watching $GME for a min to water my houseplants and just saw it’s spiking

Looks like I’m gonna drown my houseplants now repeatedly hoping for 🚀
hey glon
Is this heaven?
Sell half at least.
He has risen 🥶
Alright, I just approved the issuance of $100 million in state bonds paying 5% annual interest for you boomers among us to buy up. Should hit the news by tomorrow. Enjoy a taste of annual returns in the whole single digits, and no need to thank me, a simple blowjob would suffice.
SAVA going to 100 EOD get in retards
SPY calls!
dump zillow! 👹
Get in fuckers were going to 1200
113%, TSLA calls had higher IV than that lmao
company is also initiating their buyback soon, if not today. I think 35 by december 1 is very reasonable target.
Yeah its going to have a stupid runup.
Better price to get more
That’s your portfolio Spy/QQQ at all time highs 🙄
Sell plasma for a much better return.
losing money playing both sides god what an awful trader
Cramster (which got bought out by Chegg) saved my ass in college. Book publisher Pearson is suing them for a ton of money. Pearson is claiming the questions within their textbooks are IP and Chegg can't build a business around solving shit they wrote lmao
The leap isn't up that much. The 11/19 $35 puts are. They're up that much because the stock was trading at $62 yesterday and $35 puts were the lowest strike available meaning no one thought it was feasible it would go there, much less below that. Any ape that bought those puts yesterday is sitting very pretty right now. Even $100 would be almost 42k now.
now adjust for MSRP
Yeah, I only get 3 days off a week anyway
Patience
By the time GME actually goes parabolic again, you could have probably made the same if not more money in classic SPY calls. I love GME but the hopium is ridiculous
One hour left in trading the day before taper announced and they are buying as if it’s a positive. No matter what, it’s not positive. They are fucking with people.
Way over sold, missed by 6%, will buy here and sell at 38.
yes he's retarded, not the dude who claims a day we opened above previous close and only went up is red. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tomorrow probably green, but you're an asshole today.
🤡🤡🤡
Expiring this week?
I got half that bet right...
AMC liftoff?

GME holding towards 210! It's happening! 250 here we come!
Robotaxis are atleast 5 years away
You can't day trade with $500. You can buy one day, and sell the next but you are limited to 3 day trades in a 5 trading day span
I fucking hope so
I did today.  How can the company lose half it's value based off one earnings? But again I'm the guy who already owns TLRY, BB and CCL.  It will probably continue to tank.
It's lower now than when you predicted "liftoff" an hour ago
Same same
My calls are bleeding.  Transfusions may be needed.
You’ll make money
What’s going on it’s up 40%??
Why they gotta shit on my boi PLTR
It's earnings season. Violent movement is the norm until its over
I bought at the top and felt like a retard, then bought the 40 dollar dip I'm alright gme wise but everything else on the other hand...
Let's hope not
Can confirm.  I have bought the dip like 10 times and each time I bleed.  I can use the tax loss for YE.  Will probably buy some CGC to avoid a wash sale.
Don't feel sick for taking profits
I think maybe...juuuust maybe... there is a lesson to be learned here.
Which way?
NVAX is the real play ape
Any chance you have puts rn ? u/cashflow_
Finally have the balls to buy TSLA calls and it crabs all day
Holy shit this kid can’t read
Down

Edit: Just get back to where it was last Thursday is a 5 digit win for me!
Sq making me sick I could have taken double profits at 270 on 230 calls, but this thing spooked me so much fml. Will play sofi spec
Flat. Kenny G gonna kill our premium
You are not wrong, Sir
Can someone check on our favorite Gourd futures retard? Sounds like u/EmperorOfJenks went to Mexico and “lost his passport”, requesting a fake Canadian or German passport as a replacement over a month ago, and hasn’t been heard from seen since.
We all have the story.
https://ibb.co/WPG6hFr
Actually earnings wasn't terrible, enrollment numbers were low.
Yo what the fuck is happening with this market

Seems like a MM is stepping away or something, resulting in squeezes and pile ons. It's not all just moves uppies, see CHGG (which i agree needs to go downies). It's like weeks worth of price action are happening every day
Today was the red day retard
Tesla cucked ALOT of us today and I’m one of them here’s to hoping we run the rest of the week or my otm calls for Friday will expire worthless smfh
Still feeling sick after taking profits early yeaterday
GME holding 205 is so extremely bullish.

It's the gamma meridian line, any more upward movement and this thing is exploding go 250 from market maker hedging
If you dont understand why the market is as high as it is during a recovery year after we have printed literally trillions of dollars then idk how to help.
Things die slowly and then suddenly

I never lost any money bro, hasn't made any too
geezus i didn't realize they'd become autistic too
pretty good risk reward on trump coffee now
I remember when GME first started and I thought to myself "man this is easy"

It was not easy
In CHGG calls because it’s so oversold. Even flaming hot garbage will have an oversold bounce eventually
Saying he sucks at playing the capital markets is a statement not supported by facts and reality. Compare his results to all the CEOs who would be considered good at playing the capital markets. You say he is successful despite what you perceive as his flaws. I suggest he is successful precisely because of those same characteristics. Today, it has become obvious that playing to the public and the retail investor has replaced playing to the investment bankers and analysts. Analysts have been wrong about Tesla and Musk since he began. The CEO role will be permanently evolved because of people like Musk and Adam Aron of AMC.
OCGN approval tomorrow will be like SAVA today

Maybe the real tapering all along was the friends we made along the way and the money we lost :)
all of fintech is dipping rn. just the things the market do, maybe pricing in revenue not flying like it did this year.
I sold mine this morning. I think this week and next is better to be cash gang. But I’ve been wrong many of times
1000 put or 1400 call. You know the company.

So much fomo I'm searching the couch cushions to ensure not a single cent is left out of this market
Absolutely doused
Nah, all payment processors are in a downtrend currently tho. PYPL and SQ earnings are on deck and will be tangential. V down 20% from ATH is a decent discount and should be nearing stronger support around $200. I’d wait for a bit if it’s a long term play
Ah thanks, I thought it wa stoday as well.
Just wait till you see the memes tomorrow bruv

I've got like 500 to my name and I don't care if I lose it. What do u guys think
65c 1/21/22 here. Been holding this bitch for awhile so I’m rock hard right now
They usually report good numbers, I think they jumped last time after earnings and I was late
It should. I mean they sell popcorn so basically an unstoppable force of nature.
I can't wait for VR chat degens to start raiding Metaverse meetings. Just imagine CNN or whatever runs a story featuring VR Zuck getting grinded on by someone in a Big Chungus avatar
I feel like ass because I bought 50k worth when it was 124. Sold at 129 cause I'm stupid. So now I just fomod because it's been skyrocketing...and it chooses to drop the day that I buy? I can't make a single correct decision
That’s twice as good as leading Economists
Last k what should i get?
Who the fuck is using Chegg instead of pirate Bay? Am I just old as fuck? Seems retarded. But also this looks like an amazing entry
They will dump the data...into a new data warehouse!
Ok cramer
I don't, but it's not a bad idea, it could indeed print.
Any stock that goes up more than 3% in a day is a meme stock. Any sock that doesn’t cover the ankle is a whore sock.

Your that guy the bar has to say ‘you don’t have to go home but you can’t stay here.’
I like call of duty, gonna buy the new game, that’s all the dd I know, oh and video games are a becoming and integral part of society, girls are playing videos games more than ever it seems like, and ATVI is an industry staple and leader imo

Anyone playing LYFT and UBER earnings?
I have no idea what the f I'm doing, so I bought 10 CHGG to see if I can catch it on the rebound. If I'm right I'll buy myself dinner with it.

I'm still holding TQQQ from the March crash last year (lol) but whenever I take profit from another ticker I close on an equal amount of my TQQQ losses so it cancels out my tax liability.

yeah no shit lol
Hhmm why the hell notz
kicking myself, RH told me i had a 90 day day-trade ban but i think because i transferred 25k in it was lifted even though the full amount didn't hit the account yet. So i could've turned 5k into like 15k at least day trading TSLA yesterday but I didn't think I could. so instead i'm fomo-ing into shit like a clown today
SAVA love u long time
you don't really have to think about it. that's literally one of the proposed benefits

What the hell is happening.
Aaahhh take make sense.. appreciate the note
🌈 Bear Raid folllowed by Burry Buyout…
the company will probably be liquidating their investments today, to fulfill their statement that they'd be initiating a buyback "during value dislocations", and start the buyback tomorrow.

I'm sure they'd prefer to do so today. 

you are safe with shares entering now. hold until december 1, or at least 11/19 monthly options expiry

Saw unusually high volume on sava when it was up 5% had order in for 55c weeklies and could've gotten filled at .90 but thought it was bs volume and canceled at 12:55:58pm, those printed $17 so far :/
Tesla is so far along with robotaxis that they are selling 100k cars to Hertz to lease out to Uber drivers. The fuck?
I would hold out for an 80% loss
LC gonna smoke UPST in the long run. I considered shorting UPST to buy more LC but don’t have the guts since I could get stopped out if UPST moons in the short run
wow, 47%... over reaction?
sounds like he was a huge nerd, very bullish
If you think about it, Metaverse is really just VR Zoom
Why is SQ shitting the bed right before earnings?!
Yeah should've been out because I was about to sell the day before the big drop but of course I got busy and didn't do it
tomorrow - any major business news station at 1pm - 3pm
Ah yes. Five minutes after getting in SAVA it’s done.
I finally did it: I sold my TLRY for a 50% loss today.  $2,500 realized loss. Legalization will probably occur tomorrow.

Absolutely. If McA loses it will be interesting. If he wins no big deal. If it blows up into a big contested election then it will be really fun! Good topic. 90% of the highly regarded traders here have no clue what you are referring too.

edit: before they expire worthless
So SPY is just going to do nothing now?
If CAR can’t have short sellers… does that mean???
SPCE goes to 50 EOY?
Yes $100’s up 2mil %
Just sold half my sq 230 calls for 5 dollars of profit because honestly I’m spooked by this price action
that is the news, but the meaning is that they are positioning themselves to be Uber's outsourced fleet management provider, and may be purchased by Uber at some point
I think we should do a Nut Daily November instead of NNN.. it’s underrated
CAR short selling restricted on TDA and other platforms. They got no firepower. Let’s rip this thing to 700 by open tomorrow.
Counterpoint: A giant douche I knew in high school was working for FB at some point around half a decade ago, about when I last bothered to look at others' Facebook profiles. I'm not sure if that's bullish or not, but I do remember he had a *lot* of acne in high school, and once tossed over a board of Axis and Allies because he was losing.

Long? Please say no.
There goes CAR again.
Bought CHEGG calls today. LOL open interest 0 but actual volume of NOV 19 calls are 13,000. I can get so rich by going all in if it will rebound a few bucks tomorrow
SAVA BUYOUT RUMOR? PAMP ET
fair, but he was clearly deliberately trying to create panic. he came off as if he was questioning the tsla stock price.
lol right there with you - was busy scalping TSLA :d
Yeah that one was a joke. The rest should be solid if you buy a month and a half to two months out
SAVA GANG WYAAAA
Seen a couple people say possible buyout but who really knows I'm just enjoying the ride
there's usually a small dip b4 major fed announcements, kinda surprised it isn't actually red
Not to Late for Some brrr
Hold and hope
🍆
Wow that Chegg massacre today :o
Yeah I agree with investing smart for sure but honestly all the hits that I ever had came from stocks with 🚀 next to it I just was dumb with the money when I got there.

Been working great for me. Closed out a 3dte 1225/1250 this morning. Had one last week after closing a short 970/980 put spread. Been a fab trading vehicle.
Why is nobody talking about CAR tf
Why is it rising so fast? Sava, I mean.
&gt; I mean, it's not like I'm going to bang my wife when she has a boyfriend.
👍
Did people really just make 1 million from 1000$ call option on SAVA this morning ???
85,000% gains on SAVA calls???? Volume so low you probably would t even be able to sell those calls right?
Nancy told me SPY puts will print
I didn't even know moves down like that were possible in this market

Did SAVA have some trials or is this just one of those pumps
Why is SAVA doing that? Its just climbing for no reason.
Completely new way of lending money to borrowers using their AI tool. They're much more accurate and reliable than the traditional banks that everyone uses for financials. It's a new generation fintech business that people are still trying to figure out. But take a look at their revenue that past 2 years. It has been doubling which is crazy
whats up with sava

Tesla is just gonna dick around here until there is confirmation about the Hertz deal
I'd be careful consolidating at a lower price all day since the morning pump could mean further downside as well
WTF happened to Chegg
It has to mean more price increases, right?

Small craft advisory for the SPY Coast
If we hit 462 again, I am quadrupling down
SPY EOD $463+ bc fed/dems will yolo before infa/no taper
It is autumn.  The room is American Craftsman.  The wall of tall narrow panes separated by white oak planks looks north, onto a gentle slope full of pines.  The afternoon's snow - the first of the season - has begun to weigh the boughs, but there is no collection on the gravel drive yet.

Friends will be coming in an hour.  The wife, dressed simply but elegantly in green velvet, smiles secretly as she stirs the mulled cider.  Cinnamon and nutmeg linger sweetly on the moist air exhaling from the kitchen.  

From the attic, the soft brrr of the money printer suffuses the room. 
 The gentle sound completes the picture of comfort.

It is autumn in America.  The evening star appears, twinkling on the horizon.  The future is bright.
Calls?
kid was definitely smart which is very bullish

and he was wearing skechers which means he's serious about his work and not just in it for the money, which is even more bullish
What's the news coming out tomorrow? Why's everyone calling for a drop?
Hertz has decided the most profitable thing to do with its 100k Tesla’s is rent them to Uber drivers lol
The market is on easy mode. Worst day I've had in a week, down less than a dollar.
Invest smart and don't listen to shrills

Stay away from any stock with 🚀

WSB predicted the last 9 out of 2 bear markets.

Imagine going to back to 2000 and telling them a guy was going to start a car company that named its cars S, 3, X, Y and that it would be worth a trillion dollars
Yeah - my boss bought in at like $12 forever ago and tripled down when it first hit $4 and just held. Huge balls. It helps that he is already very wealthy.
No nut November is gay. Gonna get my nut tomorrow.

What does upstart do ?
Sorry I can’t hear you I think we’re having audio problems. What ?
Square fucking me in the ass today. God damn.
If I buy tons of puts on Zillow will it manifest sending it to zero?
I sold a third of my position at 63 since there is vague speculation driving the action right? I'm all for a buyout and I support the mission just figured if it dips I'll get back in and add more
Next stop is 1000 for a bounce. That will be a nice 5 digit win!

Edit: I'm not saying by the EOW to be clear.
What's the news coming out? Why's everyone calling for a drop tomorrow?
I just read Musks complete tweet regarding the price action on TSLA. He said exactly what me and most people here have been saying, hertz deal is irrelevant for stock price as the company is production constrained. 

I usually don't agree much with him, but I guess this time it's that obvious.
last hour? all day man
Higher quality DD than most of what passes for it here.
🔥🔥🔥
Profits have been exponentially increasing every quarter. With this dumbass market I see it keep rising like UPST did
So weird. I thought everything would go up everyday forever. 😂 

MOMO/FOMO/UHOH/OHNO! 🍻
Wow thanks for the lesson moron. Having a Biden +10 state go red would mean that Dems throughout the country would have to switch up their policy to combat a potential horrible 2022. The game would change with a Youngkin win... and with trillions is spending in limbo that could be a big deal.

Famous last words.

Good luck amigo.
SAVA is guaranteed to plummet the second I buy in, I've seen this movie too many times. It's already too late for today
whoops, silly me legging into a SAVA spread 'locking in profit'

I appreciate you giving me feedback. I’m still new to trading options, and the options that I have traded have mostly been spy and with a very short expiration. Essentially I’ve been a day trader (hence the panic of wanting to sell fb lmao). I’ve had great success with it but I’ve also lost quite a bit. I’m trying to get out of the habit of day trading and start playing tech with calls with a longer expiration and maybe even leaps. any tips you could give?

Edit: and the new call of duty coming out Friday
I’m honestly not even sure if your joking or not, I asked why a stock going up 2% causes what was a 4% increase in option value but when it drops 1% the next day it causes a 4% drop in option value. And your answer summed up was literally “because that is the current price of the option”, like no shit, your either retarded or pulling my leg
I smell fear.. or a fart.. idk  
VIX on the rise
Today is one of those magical days SPY and QQQ are green but most stocks are blood red.

Been patiently holding my 245 shares of $SAVA and I knew I'd be long the whole time. Cost average \~55.

Does Youngkin beating McAuliffe have any market impact tomorrow? Maybe if its a blowout for Youngkin? I would think McAuliffe winning would mean status quo. Youngkin might mean Ds have less a chance of passing their stimulus package

Haha well, think of it this way - if you sell when it goes positive, you made money, even if just a little. You can’t worry about what might be or what might have been, you gotta just be flexible and be willing to take some small profits. The big ones come and go, but the small bags are all over the place.
Lets hope!!!

Comon powell, announce the tappering and let my TLT puts print
It’s gonna take some time to consolidate in the 40’s before it continues the steady climb. Just too much gain too fast and people haven’t had time to digest the profit taking yet.
I always think that but I did just load 175 SPY 460p for tomorrow.

Tapering is a forgone conclusion, they're just probably gonna keep kicking the can as much as possible
Oil price is down past few days. But only a small amount... 

People are pretty trigger happy on selling the oil stocks. If oil remains at this level, most oil stocks should rise over time. Many of them still way below prepandemic levels when oil price was much lower.

Think people don't want to be holding the bag if oil tanks. Also Fed tightening could drop oil prices.

That's why I like the high div ones... you get paid still even if price drops a bit.
meta prolly gonna retrace by EOD
Scary though.
This late-stage market has just become a ruthless videogame at this point.

to be fair one investopedia article is more than most WSB users can handle
Typically I haven't held BA very long in the past.  In 2019 I bought BA then sold it for $392 per share.  I bought more in very early 2020 and sold those at $342 per share in early 2020, got extremely lucky with timing.  Right now I'm in for $207 per share and have been holding since Early June, so not very long in the long scheme of things.  I am just so accustomed to seeing BA in the 300 range that owning it at a cost basis of $200 feels safe.  It's 0.3% of my portfolio so not really an opportunity cost either.      
     
edit: I've been holding the current shares since June 2020 not 2021, my mistake
looking like a sleep for dinner kind of close today
Sooo if Tapering happens, my calls eat shit… if it doesn’t I make money…. Fuck
Often times, when a stock goes down, it's because people are taking profits or selling because they think it's now overpriced. 

Some people here talking like every time a stock goes down, it's due to shorters trying to hold the stock down and preventing it from going 100x. This is a sign of a bagholder trying to pump the stock.
Very bullish on TSLA puts

I only trade shares in IRA's not options and those are not taxed. My day trading money will certainly be raped by Uncle Sam, but I mitigate it by selling my losers before the end of the year (tax harvesting) and avoiding wash sales.
1k from OCGN and NVDA, i got greedy and bored from being cash gang and bought in at a dumb time :/
SPY is apparently never going to have a red day again.
I have calls but it looks to be falling now. I’m up 50 percent at the moment

Well I was up $1k on my META calls that expire 12/17 and now I’m down about $400 so that’s about it

Lets make it happen again.. and get the shorties that are trying to hold this stock back!! 

This will also ensure a higher premarket tomorrow as well!

SAVA has me fully erect
must be a rough day if youre posting 11 month old gains to feel better
Shits El fwago
What do you think about cruz battery metals?
I got 4 $80 11/19 calls. Holding 85 shares as well.
NVDA needs to wake back up
are my fb calls fucked or is this thing gonna start rallying?
I got time.
yea I messaged you about it this morning lol. only snagged 1 unfortunately
North, south, east, or west there is ONLY ONE AMAZON.
Wen tendies?
Holding 25 1/21/22 75 c's. Nothing too exciting
I got that part but how is it that the 35$ leap is up so high? 

Also what calls did u buy?
[deleted]
🦍
Ah there he is, Mr BonoboMan2 himself. When did you say GME is drilling to $100 again? HAHAHAHAHA
You’re probably good homie. Hold onto those at least until Friday.
Just curious. How much you down today?
Oh 100 percent but that's a 52 week wait time
Hahahahah
Those are naked strangles, not spreads.
It had the money freed up I truly would lol.
Nah.  A week of slow up trending consolidation before a runup the following Friday.
&gt;Didnt take profits this morning, now in redd

Here's a thought.

What if everyone prepares for tomorrow like normal, but 10 minutes before open FED announces a rate hike of 10yr to 4%?

This sub would be offline for about a week. Maybe the whole reddit.
FCEL nice selloff 8.75 area looks like
hells yes! I already sold stupid OTM call credit spreads to the apetards.
So no one is going to talk about SAVA
Not worth 50% less today bc of just that
Can someone take a look at $KIRK? I saw it has a high short float but can't imagine it going down the tubes.
Why are you trading 4 spreads compared to 2 naked puts? Same buying power but you would get a faster return if Russell moves up.
Nah, remember that time you said you were the best chart reader on WSB and then AMC lost half its value in a week?
Could be a legit 100 bagger if their phase 3 is successful.
goddamn SAVA is fucking shit up rn
how often do they bill you
What price?
Just brought so I can follow the Apes , I have no idea will it get approved or not
I just missed 100% profits on SAVA. Fuck
Federal government needs to pull up their boot straps and proclaim a state of emergency on supply chains and hire temporary labor and have the navy, coast guard and national guard help move supplies through ports more quickly.
I want to get in but hesitant...what are you thinking options wise?
If your gonna play earnings, do it with fuck it money
40s 11/19 should print, yes. company will initiate their buyback starting tomorrow.
I’m choosing to believe this because it means I won’t be fuk 🥰🥰
the volume on OCGN that last hour was a lot of fun not gonna lie
SAVA going wild
tmus calls free money for earnings
All you SPACs pop yo pussy like this
Holy tits my SAVA 65 1/21/22 calls are looking juicy
Cute, now post one from today.

My calls are for 1.5 months out so hopefully their is a bounce back. Fingers crossed.

Buy calls u won’t
Gme 1/21/22  950 calls
bought calls, don't think it's going to go down further
Short term traders who are betting that people wont let it go below the 1155-1160 area since thats a huge support area before 1115. Ive seen it run up in that area 10 dollars 4-5 times now.
I literally just saw this but okay. I knew I would be right that’s why I said it at premarket and sold a naked call lmfao
sAVA running
FUCK FB FUCK FB FUCK FB FUCK FB FUCK FB FUCK FB
Yes
Yeah that is gonna be a problem. Can't build planes without your anti vax boomer engineers

I'd assume a rotation to in person schooling again, plus I heard (unconfirmed) they've been ratting out people cheating on tests so they're probably flocking to coursehero and shit
These puts will print, right?
What is the play there? I looked into it and still don't understand
Oversold and manipulated. Bought 100 shares at $36
I sold half yesterday morning for decent gains on 170's. But then I bought more today on the dip and am now down just a little more than I made yesterday. DIS needs to get with the program and make me some money.
I think one more max crash would send the stock to $50 and it's 100% a possibility. They are the most crashy plane company ever
AMC earnings, anyone?
so zillow puts? gotchu
No it's not, there goes that reading.
No it’s flat lol
If tomorrow goes as expected, you have not missed OCGN run yet
bad guidance, a perfectly good reason
You're embarrassing yourself 

Are you blind?
Than why did he triple down at $150?

That was his target before it became a movement and the entire world saw 200% short interest
I’d just say open a Roth, try to max it out if you can and have it invested in some etfs.
Ocugen got shorted to fuck. 

You know what the means tomorrow: 20X the going price.
Either bull trap or massive red day tomorrow. or both

I am convinced analysts just flip a coin.
everything going down in anticipation to fomc minutes. ath's resume thursday.
yes - My contribution was mainly  in the pathology of liver disorder, as I have extensive alcohol and drug experience, unusual caudate lobe buckshot scarring, and radiation sickness -  while I handed out the real and placebo beers,  u/fatnigmongolfagotcuz  put in the hard, lonely work on the parasites. But then during the Tony ceremony he did graciously present me with an absolutely beautiful digenian trematode that he captured as it escaped from the back of a taxi.  She is with me today. We are hoping to concatenate our field notes and bedroom memories to write a punchy bestseller on the psychological repercussions of our now intimate relationship. Fats is scripting for video and finalizing a deal for the Netflix series.
So why is Chegg tanking? I think it’s stock price was high, but as a poor college student I had chegg for almost 2 years at $15 a month despite having no money and bought my books there too. It was the best money I spent on my education and grades lol. I definitely believe in their product
I’m thinking calls
it would take another long, long grounding of the 737 max

So how long would you be willing to hold the stock with your current losses/paltry gains? Years? Decades? Is there an opportunity cost?
Fucking dormers screeching about tesla puts under 1k

It's dropped 50 bucks today. The fact it hasn't drilled down is a good sign and your puts will be fucked,

So what you'd want to say is "Long XOS shares," or "XOS Nov 5th 5c" if you were holding call options at a 5 dollar strike that expire this Friday.

If you state your positions this way wsb readers assume you actually hold the positions in question.

Never heard of this company, but I've seen their Loomis truck picking up cash at my local Vons.  Quiet as F, almost ran me over.  Appreciate the info
Any of your gfs ever asked you how they should invest their money, and you have to look them in the eyes and say that you’re autistic and shouldn’t even be managing your own?
It’s not weird. I just prefer the company and back and forth of a bot to the humans around me. I live in Oklahoma if that sheds some light…
I'm wagering the top is in on TSLA

Wait on earnings. It’ll rocket on earnings. Always beat
MSTR gets me excited
What would it take to get Boeing stock back under $120? Half the BA posts on stock twits are people fantasizing about murdering their CEO or screaming about their losses. Seems like people want to sell, but have FOMO. Cramer even said the only reason he still holds it is he fears missing out when it "finally goes up". I think it's going to $80 again due to pervasive incompetence in the workforce (lost tools in planes, vax protests, etc), terrible management, and zero interest by retail along with an extremely agitated shareholder base. Anybody else in BA puts?

Edit: Google "threats of violence at Boeing" if you want some info on how shit this company is

it's over TSLA bulls. I have the high ground

been holding some GME since it dipped to 40, really not seeing anything happen here and finally thinking about tossing this shit
You can thank me for the Tesla drop, only bought some couldn’t even get a full share just fractional but everything I touch turns to shit 👍
Yep the charts have the 10EMA all the way down at 1052 right now lol It hasnt hit that in 19 days. I usually give it double the time to hit the EMA.
From what I can tell El Salvador's problem is it's overpopulated for its agricultural output and it doesn't get enough economic support. Their problem also doesn't seem to be anywhere near the worst there is on earth, there are hungry people but not really mass deaths by starvation I'm recent years as far as I'm aware. But either way a tiny slice of the 6 billion could be enough to feed them. Just take $6 million for example which is only a thousandth of $6 billion, and use it to build a factory as close to El Salvador as possible or even just right there, producing sets of vertically integrated construction robots that can build vertical farms and more of themselves, and have all that food set aside for El Salvador so that they only have to pay for shipping. It would only be a matter of time before the robots could build enough farming capacity for them, you can't guarantee we would run out of time before that happens.
Okay WISHtards I bought in today at $5.09 come get your weekly calls here!

My friend sent me a tik tok about some kid talking about using 500:1 leverage from some bs app

The top has never been so fucking in
So, indulge my ignorance.  This is new territory for the stock market right?  25 million volume of CAR after a pretty good earnings report, there has to be a travelling glob of big money targeting different stocks like this every week or month right?  Retail investors aren't loading up by the millions on these stocks, right?  A normal reaction would be 10-25% gain wouldn't it?
AAPL and MSFT moving like a married couple cute
They'll be right eventually.

Lots of people it seems. Lots of butthurt here.
Some people are tards and think it's their timezone so gotta throw them a bone. Plus I'm PST so it's force of habit to specify another time zone
Thank you for taking one for the team
Good plan. You’ll probably get laid at least twice a year that way.
They can keep the money just give me the damn youth
If I could do stocks from my phone at 19 I’d be a bajillionaire
How?? The whole point is that they may still decide to purchase more cars. Or less cars. Or no cars at all. Or ask for a discount. Until they actually get a written agreement, things may still change, as they often do in this kind of transaction.
Who here bought car at the top?
Who’s to say it’s even valued properly at $30? So many things overpriced and after sell didn’t recover. Look at DISCA and VIAC.
Overbought on every time period out to 14 days

Makes EVs.  Will pump
And it did that because?  Hertz lied about a deal.  A deal that wouldn’t even matter to Tesla.  50% in a month seems excessive, it will fall back to the downtrend, just a matter of how much of the MMs positions they can close into your hands.
Can't wait for Paypal to moon after my calls expire worthless
I'm definitely shorting. The least they could have done was choose someone attractive.

Bitch their 2 bil cash on hand and real estate value alone puts them at $150 a share. 

Than you factor in Cohen, the Microsoft deal where they get a cut off every Xbox digital store sale, and the fact they are about to create an entirely new exchange and make digital games tradeable. 

Fair value for GME is 500, when you factor in 200% short interest this is potentially a 100k stock.

Imagine thinking you know GME better than DFV.

There's a reason all the new hires chose to be paid in shares

Maybe don’t buy after a huge run up?
Please Dear Jesus send us a good 10-20% correction. I need it.
People like him channel their hate and disgust into life force, like tapping into the dark side. A decade from now, Cheney will still be shooting people in the face and forcing them to apologize.

I wanna slap the shit outta every “I’m 19 look at my gains” post
More expensive than the F150 EV but has better range. Think it'll really take off when they progress the tech further cause I think the F150 is still the economical choice despite the lower range
As soon as I get my millions I am gonna help people. I will be a phullonrapist.

I fukn sold at .12  Im an idiot
I'm going to wait until after earnings before buying zillow. Big players like this stock for some reason , it's 10th on ARKK.
Because sometimes we get a little curious

Throw it all into random options so you have the chance to feel something again.
You make 160k a year and work remote, theta gang and live like a king in a couple years
It's been revealed that something like 3/4 of the homes they purchased for their ibuying service are underwater, and they've started the process of unloading the properties for a loss. Earnings will reveal how bad this impacts their bottom line, but investors are estimating a pretty big hit.
right - either way, think it'll actually be a good move for hertz to expand their EV fleet so they can increase volume on their most profitable rental line
SPY overbought on the 1day 

is it time for short term puts
Leave me alone bot
Watch some reviews of the R1T, it seems just about as capable as any modern truck despite being a little ugly. If they can produce them I think they'll sell
And you think they would simply buy 100k cars and worry about that latter? You're dense.

Only 200 but close enough 😂
It’s only up like 15x in a year why can’t it go higher

Naw it's a 500 stock at 200 with the craziest short interest of all time making it potentially a 100k stock

Everyone was saying that when it was red last Wednesday, then it ran another 15%
I've been waiting to see your positivity!!! Let it shine.  More calls it is
Since they can manipulate stock prices, they can technically just buy calls/puts before earnings after putting out horrible guesses. Obviously, they'd have to find a way to do it without getting caught.
I need my stocks to do more shit

Are you serious? I guess in your mind, hertz told their intern to go to the Tesla website and order the 100k vehicles. 

There's plenty to be negotiated and agreed on, including delivery dates, priority for those deliveries, use of the supercharger (supposedly for free), maintenance costs, potential repurchase options, some form of financial kickback for introducing the Tesla experience to new costumers... Do I need to go on? Of course not, you already knew that, but too stubborn to admit

Hope ur right buddy I got puts too
The fact Tesla isn’t tanking hard is a good sign actually. Usually it dies hardddd, definitely gonna see another stupid power hour run
puts already up too much =(
Thanks man. I keep grinding. Getting better everyday. Just quit my day job. Full time investor now. Will start my own tik tock soon.
It’s a good song pal give a it listen
11/8 449p
Not how their program works. I just bought and sold through them.

They gave me $120k over market value and helped me buy (didn't buy a Zillow owned home). Now, they are liating my house for an $80k loss before they even had it listed for a day.

It's not failing because they are cracking up prices on ones they are selling. They are taking a MASSIVE hit on the ones they are selling.

They're not trying to get anyone to pay too much. The algorithm was wrong and THEY paid too much for homes.
To be honest, next year is election year.
JPow is running for reelection 

Don't be shocked if the taper thing is delayed. I'm just saying. No one wants to run in a year when the market is tanking.

Just saying..
That's how boomers think, not millennials.
All they know is they bought puts at $500, and for some reason even tho it’s at $330, half of their investment is gone. 
“It’s going down, how am I losing money!?”
Why are you buying calls on a stock that never goes up?
Wow another FUCKING MASSIVE red vol candle on SPY,
They've been trying to get approval for so many months already. Think it'll be a sell the news once it's realized that there's no demand in the major countries
crazy how greedy the market is at ATHs

y’all trust the FED way too much
Just say the strike fool
Best thing about owning shares over options is you can sell in after market. No worse feeling seeing your options up xx% in PM only to see it open flat or down 😅😅😅
When it says "order executed" does that mean you are killing it with your trades?
Wanna buy a put from me?
meta is the future it will go the way of something that hasn't been before
If you were waiting for a TSLA dip now's your chance.
imagine not caring about fomc especially as a gambler
You shouldn’t be surprised by SAVAs bounce you really shouldn’t

Buy any dip. If there's a dip.

What's going on with SAVA, can't seem to find news but it's absolutely blasting.
Have you heard of TSLA
I remember when I thought covid was a nothingburger.
SQ did their earnings drop ahead of time. Very convenient.
Anyone going in for casino or DKNG ER

SAVA up from its nap. Still groggy
What’s your play? Thinking about buying PUTs
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
its because i bought calls sry
Makes dorks like you mad which is pretty sweet
Lol they bought all their inventory at the top/peak buying season in a historical record setting sellers market, not much runway left to offload
Idk, I almost opened a position in my IRA earlier but fidelity slid in with the news that an insider sold on the 29th (after they plummeted). Might be one of those scenarios where they scheduled the sell well ahead of time, but I don’t want to find out the hard way
Yep, if you are playing roulette you want to know who is spinning the wheel. Tomorrow is Jpow

Got spooked when I checked and saw the big drop on OCGN and panic sold. Really regretting that now.
I was going to ask im holding i think its taking a breather. It hit 42.68 so buying pressure is there for the remainder of the week

LETS FUCKING HEAR IT
You're actually gonna need to hope it opens/trades at sub 460. Even if it's down $1 at open you're still gonna lose like 70% to theta
Thinking about buying lucid but I get the feeling it’ll dip more 👀

no, fuck him and his autism
I got febs because the next earnings should be a bloodbath
ATVI PUTs and Z calls anyone?
Unless you got itm puts they most certainly arent
Lol, yeah I'm thinking the same thing. I just had a pretty good couple of weeks and closed out of most of my positions, have like 2K free cash which is way more than I'm accustomed to - trying to think of positions that I can make use of with this increased buying power that aren't just long naked calls
You thought you bought the CHEGG dip didn’t you ? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
So long as fed keeps giving banks free money the worst case scenario is sideways trading. If your dead set on doing it then get a hedge or instead of doing puts buy SPXS instead so you won't go broke if you are wrong.
My FB calls are getting wrecked..
Love AMD but they’ll have selling pressure as long as the chip shortage exists.
bruh give it a week or two. FB going to moon.
It’s meta now sorry
I have SPY puts at 20 day moving average to hedge
Easy sir, this is a casino have another drink 🍹
.02% off wth and the bears are out trying to prove they're smart buying puts. Lmao
Yes don’t do it yet
Lol for real. I hate when people post about these 5 digit percentage plays. It’s insiders or an unexpected event. Period. I had it happen to me when GRUB a few months back I just happened to be holding. 

Those plays are moreso about the explosion in IV.
Looks like that federal investigation is pretty serious
How many of you retards are getting IV crushed to hell and back on CAR from earlier? Don’t lie
God speed bro I took gains and taking day off I’ll for sure re buy if we open green tomorrow

Should’ve sold tsla yesterday like you greasy mongs told me to
It's doing better then the fucking stock
Zillow is just doing their listings wrong. 

Millenials will pay literally anything for a house without ever thinking about paying it off. Crank up the prices 80k per house and tell them what a sweet deal it is with zero down and low interest. Then drop the crank to 60k and they'll think they won the lottery.
I swear if you go on stock twits unless it’s Microsoft or Tesla literally everyone thinks the ceo of every company is trash with the exception of maybe Souki with TELL as an outlier. You’d think the world economy was going out of business because apparently no good CEOs exist anymore unless it’s MAANG.

shitty guidance, earnings were okay and cashflow from operations improved considerably, as did user adds
No idea how CS works, huh?
AEO is set to buy Quiet Logistics for $350 million. Bullish?
Who in their right fucking mind would do that without insider knowledge?
Tim’s dick is sooo limp
Regardless of the earnings, the buying program that all their eggs went into was a dud and gonna cost them billions. They literally have to start over which could take another 2 years of planning/funding.

By then will be way behind the other iBuying services and we should see the $30/$40 range again.
Someone give me a reason not to throw 15K in SPY puts
CAR destroyed estimates. They did this last earnings too. Why? Because those analysts are "horrible" at guessing. They only exist to manipulate stock prices.
Say bye-bye
Had a great halloweekend! 🎃
Bought 1200 weeklies when it was at 1187 today.

I deserve this.
That it's also dropped a significant degree...?

They basically admitted they bit off more than they could chew and want to offload 7k homes.
Depends on your strike. If it's decently OTM theta decay gonna snap it real hard and you gotta pray FOMC takes this shit down
Sum ting Wong
I don't need ya'll this stonks mooning no matter what you fucks think

Actually prefer all you paper hands stay out of it
Loop 💍 

iykyk 👀
Pay for more time my friend
MOASS?!!!!!
Nice, thanks 🙏🏼
Puts are printing bought at 462 🥰🥰
Buying puts is asking to flush $ away on spy
All summer when we were house shopping, realtors insisted, there’s nothing amiss.  There’s no greed like 2007.  This is low supply and high demand from qualified buyers and inflation…blah blah blah….

Enter Zillow and their greedy fuckery
Fyi, fmc meeting press conf tomorrow after lunch.
A reminder on what you missed out on. You could have bought CHGG puts 35 strike exp Nov 19 for 0.02 yesterday, and could sell them for 4 each right now. Nearly a 20000% gain.
I actually think even retail can understand these moves. not rocket science why both are falling, though chgg is a bit extreme in my opinion.

but that's the nature of dislocations, hard to time bottoms
Tesla poots printing
Earnings in days and they are gonna provide pathetic revenue results, it's gonna get worse
Great point
F
BROS earnings around the corner, tempting to load
Bump

How is Visa still bleeding wtf
YOU’RE*
Fuck off shrill

No one wants to lose money for your own gains on options

You posted 5 minutes ago that it was about to take off at 205. It's now  202

Shut up already
33.3m volume is super normal, tf u saying?
Autism is my favourite season.
Imagine acting like you’re successfully swing trading when we all know you went bullish at the top yesterday and then bearish at today’s bottom too ya fuckin tard
45 dollar puts are 9 bucks. Hmmmmm
Im holding the line. My conviction is high, pullback and rightback into bull szn
GME 200c
None of the cultists bought in at that price. I remember $20. Few were on that train. 

They all jumped in at $300+ like idiots.
How much it cost for American women to find me attractive? I’ve got 3 Zimbabwean dollars.
We still holding plug bois??
Close
I’m a permabu but I ain’t dumb. Some bagholder bought my short shares this morning at $500 a pop and price is at 333 right now. Tendies.
If you dont buy CYN rn ur an idiot
You’re*
Memes are back!!!!
Zillow puts are super expensive... does that mean what I think it means
Like honestly your kinda dumb not to invest in GME at this point if you know everyone holding direct registered shares worth the entire float isn't selling under 10k a share. 

Where's the risk?

Use the yard strength to your advantage, there is no safer stock right now
Wtf can spy go down please? This is not what I was expecting for the week of FOMC. I want to buy a dip
Ho Lee Fuk
Lol
Puts on Z 75p has to fall like chegg
Everyone’s saying puts, I have puts, which means inverse all of us
Spooked by the FOMC boogeyman?
I did Dec 3 and Jan 21. Higher premiums but not as risky…I know not very WSB
Yes
SQ following PYPL to the grave, apparently
Marked safe from making money today
COP26 better not fuck with my portfolio
Fuck theta decay
LMAO imagine not swing trading
Do I sell these 470c for Thanksgiving for 68% or hold through meeting
Welp its your guys last chance before the spacex rocket refuels and takes TSLA to dah MOON
Negotiating
Like honestly your kinda dumb not to invest in GME at this point if you know everyone holding direct registered shares worth the entire float isn't selling under 10k a share. 

Where's the risk.
Looks like it's dropping to me.
Imagine looking at Zillow and chegg and saying buy the dip without having a fucking clue what’s going on whatsoever
Is that ban bet?
I hope they go to zero for screwing middle class America out of homes
oh fuk forgot bout my BABA ban bet, should've made it for after earnings. oh well bybyeeeee tomorrow
Wrong sub.....but check out $DIVO. I really liked that dudes strategy. I think its a pretty unique one.
PLTR -3.24%
Iv crush would still hit hard if i bought options on car? Cash gang btw
ROKU call buyers, why you getting calls?
Wtf...you think someone is trying to stop you from giving out food in El Salvador? Nobody is stopping you. Why dont you go there and buy a few meals for the street kids. Stop talking shit and go do something. To a salvadorean street kid you are a billionaire. Unfortunately after you leave they will go back to starving.
Yes
I hear IONQ is the future of something.
Z dumped hard today imagine how hard it's gonna dump after earnings today...
Anyone have a play for $Z Zillow earnings?
Retiring is boring... In the market till you die
Should I sell my spy puts expiring tomorrow for 20 percent gain or yolo it for a possible multi bagger hmmmmmmmm I feel like it’s due for a small pullback
And I hope you get fucked on every play ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)

Some in TWO 10%+ returns, might shoot up 100% at any time

YUUP!
do you not think they're going to blow out ER in 7 days lol
Wee Too Low
What would happen if a huge asteroid hit the earth?
i know right? but what could they say during earnings that would be remotely positive?
still sorta bummed out by NOKIA.

so much potential, but their earnings report was just doublespeak garbage.

any positive thoughts regarding our favorite indestructible phone maker of yore?
Computrom!
Guys. This is my fault. This is the first time I’ve bought TSLA calls in all my years of trading. 

My bad.
Oopsadasie
Ah shit who spooked SPY
ET earnings tomorrow after close and dividends paying out. 11/5 10c are .08, probably throw a little cash at this one.
They'll just get bailed out, it's cool.
Today and tomorrow.
Absolutely nothing.  It’s already built into the pricing.
Hertz: We're going to buy Teslas

Musk: No you're not

Hertz: Yes we will

Avis: We doubled our profits this quarter renting electric cars
Seems like a good play. Thanks man, GL to you!!
I’m seriously thinking the language is going to change a bit tomorrow…..they just can’t blind side the country out of nowhere
No
That’s the fucking reasoning that keeps me losing it all hahaha
you don't have the steady hands or the technology to pull off a procedure like that
Earnings at close, let's see lol.

Bad earnings have to be priced in by now tho
Lmao exactly. Hesitant to play puts for this reason. Too obvious, a bit suspicious.
I'll just buy more, we own the boat, price is fake

There is no safer stock right now

Don't you know, market crash is 1 of many MOASS catalyst
Big shoutout to /u/AppyWappy for spreading plenty of hate and negativity to our Ape brethren. Puts a smile on my face when I don't have to be the one to smack them down with FACTS and LOGIC.
Yes, maybe soon...but definitely could see $30 by Q12022
&gt; I'll tell you what's a beta move. You going to Disney World with your family on vacation
F! Hope you make it out bro
Movie theater company 🦍🦧
OCGN a buy?
Good old BABA, I knew my gains were too good to be true 😂 Shit ER will be followed by a return below $150 so I can officially lose everything I gained so far on these Calls
It’s weird seeing Facebook’s new name attached to its stonk.. such a beta move by Zuck the Cuck
Having a gun but having no clue how to safely own and operate it
Is there a chance Tesla is going to say no we won't sell you the cars? No.
Gme went up over 100x in a few months. 100 is more than 10.
ANUS cause i accidentally drank real milk with my latte this morning
I have a horrible feeling in my stomach about the end of the day and tomorrow. I think you are crazy if you hold overnight.
PLTR is consistently trash.  Which makes sense because it's one of my biggest positions.
As they say; You win some, you lose a lot.
Facial recognition to easy to trick. If I cut your face off and wear it, it has no idea
A -12% day the day before their earnings that if they miss will drill another 30%? Yeah.
Company execs are literally just retards in suits. Let’s be real.
Lmao Chegg puts went up 39,000% just one trade like that and u retire.
What Zuck *really* means is he's not letting people know anymore Meta is gonna use facial recognition 🤡🤡🤡
A tad late
Maybe a breather day 1420.69 EOW tho
buying puts on a stock down 12.5%, just inverse yourself
They still have it internally, just don't expose to spook people about snooping
No he said a ticker that’ll go up not one constantly going down
I sold my pltr dec calls yesterday, so it might go up more. But prob sell
Yes
UHAL will be a big mover, if not I will give everyone here $100
What would happen if trump announced he was with PLTR to see if the election was rigged?
Zillows gotta almost be at the bottom since people in here are calling puts "easy money"
Please let it crash the housing market
Lol that is true. Hype alone doesn't put money in your hand
Holy fuck that was a massive red candle on SPY
Z executives : “let’s buy out all of this property at record low interest rates. Literally can’t go tits up”

Goes tits up

Z executives: ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
GREE recovering. OI and call volume are insane
It’s just rent. Let’s go
Or CLOV! Still holding 30K worth..... OOOF!
Just sell covered calls, PLTR never going back up.
11/19 40 may print. the company announced a larger buyback and "we will buyback stock during times of value dislocation."
Me angry when meme man make ban joke &gt;:(
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
[deleted]
Buying puts on a -12% day? Yeah nty
what does facebook getting rid of facial recognition mean

that seems like a ton of expensive technology and many years of work to just toss in the trash

do they have something newer on the horizon? are they just shelving the technology for now?
The real answer is an S&amp;P500 index fund, everything else is increased risk. There is a reason the all time greats like Buffett say that index funds are the smartest way to make money without taking on extra risk. Everyone else is playing a game of hot potato to be completely honest. But since you’re here the correct answer is all in on $TSLA Calls
Any day tlry goes up, buy puts, it’s free money at this point
Really want to see Tesla go green even for just a minute today
Is the government buying spy with our grandchildren’s tax money or no?
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
They done
Ticker URMUM
Is zillow going to $50?
Fuck PLTR. Shit trades more sideways than AAPL. 

Fuck. I’m in an abusive relationship.
How much ya make?
Zillow puts for earnings today ah? Seems like a no brainer. And no brainers usually means opposite happens.. hmm
GME apes beside themselves , locked their shares up in Computer share LMAO 

when the market correction comes, they’re going to get fucked SO HARD
To be safe? MSFT, AAPL. To be medium risk? AMD, NVDA. 

High risk, potentially high reward? Biotech stock. OCGN or MRNA or scan the FDA approval calendar and see who has approvals pending.
Lucid cutting me pretty deep rn
GREE pucker up MFs
Both.
Because he knows it's way overvalued, and is actually honest and dgaf

Basically pure idiots/autism driving it so high
VTI 
Or 90% in VTI and a few lottos. AAPL, FB, MSFT.  The companies that are building the future.
Because he's an asshole narcissist who spends more time shitposting on Twitter than he does with any of his 7 kids.
Can we talk $DIVO here or not? I didn't see a market cap on it?
Made 10% gains but that’s not enough. Do I risk it all for a 100%?
I'd say mainly by hiring security for the people that already want to distribute food so that they can't be stopped anymore, since violence is the main thing cutting off supply lines and causing people to starve these days
Yikes.  I’m only down $400.  It was a small position and way OTM
Thank you sir, hope you get fucked
Who are the retards buying these crazy expensive HUT puts?
Ah shit I’m a retard, thought jpow started tampering 😂
MSFT leaps too poor for TSLA
More likley 20!
You don’t think rumors cause price action? Invest on rumor, then trim after 100%… then wait and see?
The flying CAR is finally here
Tesla can’t even break 1170 now 😓
0dte OTM FD calls on any meme stock of your choosing
I may be over levered ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
That ain’t right
See ya
I said day trade
I remember GME always went up before fed meetings. Will history repeat itself?
If spy up almost .4% on tapers eve then spy 500 by thanksgiving is a lock
wow that's some hard hitting analysis right there
These were 11/5 1400 lol they’re done
Totally fair, and yeah I don’t really think of TESLA as truly propping up SPY, but that sentiment is so prevalent.
Narrator: it tanked
I bought the dip, and it kept dipping. down humongously. 

the company will buy back shares, but can't do so same day most likely. wait to close your 11/19s.
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/Renegade2592** bet **GME** goes from **204.65** to **250.0** before **2021-11-05 13:26:08.773515-04:00**
Not with this kind of volume
One of you people give a stock that’s gonna rip soon that no ones talking about🧑🏼‍🦽💨
Is there anything more American than eating multi-grain tortilla chips dipping in ranch dressing mixed with hot sauce?
When GME really popped, it went up bigly after hours. Same thing with CAR? Not playing it, just a thought.
Pltr
Give him a break he has autism.
I want $230 by 2:30
!banbet GME 250 3d
Tomorrow big time Rockets! Stop loss raid and paper hand shake out is done up we go now.
Closed my puts from yesterday, but there is likely more meat on the bone with Tsla and PLTR looking pretty tired.
The Zillow dumpster fire is about to hit earth's core.

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
You bought OCGN? What is wrong with you?
Spy calls or puts
You got 4 fingers.
Forget about it? Nowhere. Dumping it into a megacap or ETF is a lazy bitch way of making money for unexceptional people.

You should at least be managing it by selling calls on your assets. Bleed up twice as fast.
Msft
sell my coin calls ?
#$Z PUTS FOR A 10 BAGGER FOR TOMORROW

Netflix just pulled off their grand turnaround plan so literally nothing special except for a dog food enthusiast.
On margin.
It’s called lithium batteries
Nah, too many people fleeing that fund.
TSLA cup and handle, pls fly
Love seeing the long leg of my credit spread that I thought was crazy OTM become a 10 bagger lol fuck this. Why is QQQ ripped up so much the last few weeks
Made more on NVAX in an afternoon than I did in a whole six months of bagholding shitty OCGN.
Can I smell it?
AAPL, MSFT, GOOG all green and very large cap.
Facebook bans nipples atm.
The entire year has been a dip for ARKK
We got this!
i had enough of this shit. if you have a lump sum of money (say 200k) where would you dump it and forget about it for 10 years?
When TSLA rug pull??
why can't elon just keep his mouth shut sometimes jeez
You didn't format your ban bet correctly. I sent you the correct format, please update it.

Hard to say with how volatile TSLA is... I was just messing with numbers on 11/5 options like 15-20% OTM

&amp;#x200B;

/e would have to risk a significant amount for \~5% gain what I am looking at, but i guess how likely does it expire OTM in just 3 days...
You, yesterday: “Tesla is going to 1300 or 1500 on this gamma squeeze”



You, today (too gay): ***IM A BEAR NOW FLDLSJDHDBZ DNSKD***
I gotta stop going creative and buying stupid shit like Vale
Here we go again. Shorting and puts no longer allowed in CAR by TDA
Let’s buy up shares for OCGN!!!! Fuck the shorts
Anyone touching ARKK? Mommy and daddy have given us a dip.
CAR pulled a GME. You see? You fucking cultists. This shit happens ALL THE TIME.  

GME is not magical.
RKLB calls  for dec
Smarter than someone claiming there's no deal involved in hertz buying 100k cars.
If I owned Dell I’d shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.
Aaand here comes GME liftoff.

Get ready to fomo into 220cs
Puts
Alright, back in the casino…. Just picked up TSLA $1450 11/12 calls here. Let’s goooooo!
CAR I need to close my naked shorts before end of day. So if you could give me a LITTLE bit more gains I'd be happy.
I bought in the 40s and 50s look at my post history 

 💰
Looks like it was too early for Chegg calls.
I recommend the Honda civic
Yeah because you lack comprehension haha

Mans got contracts and don’t even know how the price action works 😮‍💨
So nothing is gonna happen till jpow opens his mouth. 

It would be funny if he threw on sunglasses, cracked a Busch Light, and shouted brrrrrrrr
So is our reguarly scheduled 230 drop going to be big today, or am i just a geyber heading into FOMC
All while up near ATHs
SPY looking like a loading spring right now, does it shatter and plummet to the core or relaunch is the question
Good for banks in general. Deposits are mostly free so lending at higher rates increases margins.
I sold naked chgg puts lol I'm fucked, Im gonna lose the horse
Pleas fly agaen okugen
Nah wanted to sell cc’s but didn’t want to pay 15 a share
Talked to your mother last night.
Depends whose dick you’re sucking.
If you bought at the top and been down 50% just say that…
The one big advantage with NCLH is just how discounted the stock still is. Easy 100% upside in 12 months. 

I could be wrong, though, I'm a retard.
fb calls
It does if you are an MM and busy closing your positions.
Rip before the big dip
It makes you a lot of money. I’m up 1200% with MSFT in shares
220 eod
What if he retires so he can go back to making millions insider trading?
Here me out calls on balls 🚀
Damn I thought I was late to the show at 88. Congrats

Sold 1300c 11/5 at 3:59 yesterday. Made a bunch of money. I don't think I'll time it that good ever again.
i've considered it many times - how far out exp / OTM would you consider being acceptable risk/reward?
Tesla is picking up momentum again to the upside
TLRY calls. Praying this is a solid support area for a baby bounce.

The dip before the rip.
How smart do you feel after posting this?
If the Fed hinted at earlier interest rate hikes, would that make the banks go up or down ?
Stop buying Tsla in a bad spot.  Remember, the steeper the crash, the bigger the bounce.  Just sell and buy back in at 900 for the next runup.
If ocugen wasn’t about to moon the big money wouldn’t be doing everything in their power to get their shares cheap and drive down the price. This stock is going to cross 17 tomorrow.
If that was the caase should of done it at 16? Hold going to double that tomorrow!

I say sideways.
Just don’t end up living in a van, DOWN BY THE RIVER
I bought my Ford in the high 12's and it hit my target of 18 so I cashed out. Still like EV angle and have always liked GM too. So I will play in the GM sandbox for awhile. It hasn't run like Ford.....yet.
Sour or Power Hour?
i dont trust that they are going again , maybe im wrong. good luck but ima go with MAR
Imagine holding gamestock since January and missing life changing gains on other stocks
RIOT is heavily shorted should be with MARA can I get some help from you guys ffs 🚀🚀🚀🚨🚨🥲
Holy shit I am so turned on by the cultural appropriation in the banner.
Hang on just give Tesla a minute, it’s hooked up to a rapid charger. Systems should be optimal for power hour.
Yay! That's the kind of lie I need to keep me going!

U know tsla going to rip last 10 mins.   Get some fd calls sell 1 min to close
Bottoms in on tsla (hopefully) 1200 EOD
Opendoor is going to take the full vertical moat. This is what all Zillow stans don’t understand. iBuying is just the first entry and the practical expansion piece.

Wtf I made over 5k this month just holding Msft shares, you assholes told me that investing like a boomer wouldn’t make me any money
Zillow kinda ruining my life rn
Did anyone have Chegg puts?
For those that bought calls in the last 6 hours of trading, true.
It’s not good for your mental health
Too much gain porn here, my spider sense is tingling. TSLA call holders nearing 20% US GDP. If they keep letting Elon get much richer, he will buy Taiwan and build his own autistic nation. Something is coming
PLTR heading back to 24 as usual sorry
Did I mention I’m balls deep in ACB?  I know pain brother

It didn't crash, they just spun out half the company into a new one. Previous holders were issued a VMW share from the new company.

I thought your premise was people where traveling. Also, you definitely do rent cars on port calls.
I wish GME would hurry up so I can buy my parents South Dakota for Christmas 😔
I’m sure you’ve been saying that since it was at 1050.
Ok so its not just me
Sir the float is diluted to hell it’s theta gang heaven
GME 210
Finally it’s a retard’s market again
Like right at 630 am open ur saying
&gt; Yes.

Down 20% on coffee stock. I knew I was being retarded and I did it anyway.
Have you ever heard of TLRY
is it at $30?  No?  Then yes.

I wouldn't be surprised if it did considering it took last Tuesday as a breather day too
Solving world hunger doesn't mean paying for food for everyone on the planet, it means getting food to the people who are starving.

Shorting tesla is a fucking rush
Weak. I used to have anywhere from 5 to 10 episodes every night.
30 would definitely be ideal
are you fucking kidding me
If you died this morning you would still be dead this afternoon.
Ya totally forgot earnings, ty.
Market gonna crash it's due for a correction
Think it might depend on how FOMC spooks the market. Thinking a steady climb back to 1225 is probably what's gonna happen if FOMC goes badly
[deleted]
RIOT gonna overtake HUT and MARA if it stays above $30. $30 is max pain level.
I’ve never been in an abusive relationship before but I’ve owned PLTR for almost a year which is pretty much the same thing
LOL
Lollll honestly anything is fucking possible at this point. I give up on all rational thought.
So calls?
Earning right, totally forgot thanks.
TsGuh for bulls that bought calls.
Guh
About to throw all my money in dell wtf
What? You want me to explain how 6 billion wouldnt solve world hunger? How much money do you think has been spent trying to solve world hunger? El Salvador has 6 million people. How much does a meal cost? $1 a meal? So 6 million dollars a meal. You do the math on how long that will last. What about 2 whole meals a day? There are probably 50 other countries with even bigger populations. If 6 billion dollars could solve world hunger, it would be solved. Blaming Elon for world hunger is beyond stupid.

Iv probably a bit high
SPY has a 0DTE tomorrow. That is all.
But which on that’s the thing
Bought calls at the very bottom point in March, lol. It's kind of dumb though... the stock price is basically going up on pure multiple expansion, not due to growth of the underlying business. 

It is growing earnings, but not nearly enough to justify the move
IV
My VIX calls are ready.
[deleted]
The catalyst news hasnt even come out yet. Youre freaking out at institutions selling their stocks to get better lower call positions like hellooo becuz they know it will rocket. No stop loss shake would be a bad sign. This is a good sign they know good news is coming
Holding AH?
Good
Or a large institution just dunked on you bagholders by shedding 10M shares before tomorrow decision. Keep holding though, im sure itll work out for you
Puts to the tits
What about NCLH?
Lol I’ll just buy them some tape then so they don’t have to stupid fucking bear
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Chegg calls?
It’s just numbers and letters bro. Nothing matters just join us
Your right...fk it.  Going to buy more TSLA calls.
Wow tsla what are you doin step brother
Update
I lost money
Who knew Avis was shorted?
Taper and interest hikes need to come this economy is sinking fast
Just not until their winter Olympics are over. That would ruin the show.
Any in PLTR calls for 26.5c 11/5? I have 20 of them at .26, thought I got the bottom, but it keeps going down, do you guys think I sell or hold
Anyone buying SBUX?

I’ll probably regret this but…SPY puts today. I don’t trust that TESLA keeps propping everything up short term.
This market will shit, piss, and throw up in the bed tomorrow. You have been warned. All this euphoric bullishness and out-of-control meme madness will come to a crashing end starting with Fed tapering.

Whatever floats your boat.
They don’t know what the Fed will do beyond tapering bond purchases.
He didn't even say it would. He said it DID open above $200. He might be retarded, and I hope he is the one who bought those shares at $500.

OCGN is such a P&amp;D. Burned the shit out of me last week. Learned my lesson and stayed out. No revenues and won’t make any unless their vaccine is approved by the FDA, which may never happen.

They just design the chips. The architecture behind them. TSM produces them. TSM probably sourced from a mix of ASML, AMAT, LRCX, etc
if you bought $800 worth of 260c on $CAR this morning, at the peak , you’d be up $300k
Where is TSLA will reach $1500 crowd who downvoted me yesterday 🤡

so we buying this tesla dip or naw?

Permaban that cultist moron
Rivian market cap is higher than Honda.  

Nice. There's no way this can end badly.
Again your contract price has nothing to do with the “%” gain on your stock. When you saw a decrease in your contract value it’s because the PRICE OF THE CONTRACTS decreased from 22.43 to about 21.80. When you saw the increase it’s because the CONTRACT INCREASED from 22.43 to about 23

Neither of those were equal to the stock movement, Option contract generally move linear with the stock price, but not equally

If that makes sense lol

Also remember that gain % is almost double whatever loss you take

If you lose 10% you’d have to make about 20% to break even
I mean yeah? Wait a week, get paid 1 or 2 thousand bucks depending on the environment, free up your entire cash stack for the next play.
Also 461p for Friday. Gl.

/u/tonylix (0/1) made a bet that GME would go to 300.0 when it was 186.3 and it did not. They were automatically banned for two weeks.

You going to have to say TSLA 120
Yeah I like shares on VXX for that same reason. Theta's a bitch, but you're right on those spikes. Can keep my portfolio green on even the reddest of days.

May not be funny and may not be original...but 100% of my PUTs have never printed and 85% of my CALLs have. Just hedging my bets in the casino.
I literally just saw it for the first time lol…was looking for a potential trade on the bounce back here

Is this gonna be another EOD power hour run for Tesla that makes no sense but somehow takes the stock to a new ATH?
My 11/19 calls were up 30% yesterday but now they’re down 30%. 

That’s what I get for being greedy.
no no no. *this* time it's different and it's gonna go to 1 quadrillion 🤡🤡🤡
Nike puts?
CAR was a 300x bagger at $100 per contract or 750x bagger if you bought at $40 and sold the top wtf....
OCGN wtf? Time to buy in or watch the knife?
Is AMC earnings today amc? Or did it happen already?

Need to know whether to buy puts or shorts.

Edit: lol, just saw the punny.
It's been going through the same pattern since march. Maybe we'll see it reach around 250 if there's still enough hype but it'll dip down to 150-180, then climb back up to around 200, and then repeat.
It's a horse of a different color. Both are hedge fund chew toys
nvax 250 eow LFG
They will but the same as Apple did to Samsung and Amazon did to Walmart :()
idk now im confused so i bought more
CHGG is so flat right now, it's eerie.
I can’t believe I didn’t sell meta call earlier today.
CNBC = 🤡
Guess who just put up $10k of capital to make 50 bucks 🤡
What tf wrong with Z?
LOAD THE 1200 CALLS 🚀🚀🚀
Recession canceled, bulls win again
Just got 10 spy 673c expiring friday
I was surprised it was running again
idc what people say. i was in GME 10 mins ago
It's the copium talking
SOXL great outlook
$10 k credit limit can provide me cushion if some golden play arrive.
I’ve never seen people so excited over a fucking car rental company.
Its already down so much though
Downvoted for length
obviously but that guy takes it to a hilarious new level i'd never imagined existed
TSLA $900p?  It never has a run like this without pulling back.
Bagholder spotted. Tell us what you’re in for
But I thought the meme here was that right after you buy something, it goes down?
Buy

He is incontinent of stool
It’s the same price action and movement when Spy got to 452 in late august not saying there will be a huge drop like that but I’m all out with a couple Puts 

Will buy the dip

Said one bag holder to the others. Little did they know… it never did blast off again. Things are funny like that sometimes. Sometimes a CAR can go fast in entirely the wrong direction.

Where’s the fucker that told me to get Spy puts?

What do they make?
Holy moly, cold war with China is about to turn warm next year. I'm out of direct China exposure but how does one get out of indirect exposure with ever company in sp500 having deep relationships with China. Is this going to be an unwinnable war?
Banbet or STFU with your vagina monologue
Lmao what a tard
Why is no one on here playing $NVAX?
Tanger barely has those stores, it's an outdoor outlet franchise. The previous boom was literally because it wasn't indoors. 

It's making more money than the infamous MAC who also owns apartments and business services along with malls. Tanger literally only has outdoor malls, this soaring is due to massive earnings and new companies leasing spaces like Verizon and best buy. Amazon is also in talks, that will be another explosion.
Every time they promise for real this is the time. It never is. Cult scam artists. =|
I’m asking why it “checks out” when the underlying moving up 2% yesterday causes a $70 increase in value but the underlying dropping 1% today causes a $70 drop in value. Your basically saying beacuse that’s what’s the market is willing to pay which is a given, but it seems to not be correctly correlating to the underlying stock.

Edit: The implied value of an option has nothing to do with the the last sale price it’s all bid/ask
[deleted]
its honestly hilarious, u retads think your actions have any effect on the markets. USA#1
i bought calls sorry, every purchase i make has to start with a 20% drop just to shave a few years off my life
Who makes the equipment AMD/Nvidia buy to make their chips?
We good bruh. We’ll make back those losses. I’ll remind myself to not be emotional on next trades
Better then car
Can't wait for VXX to reverse split again
Did they release the decision?
It went down same way last week, just richer people trying to buy up all the low positions by shaking out stop losses, then it doubles back up
All in on SPY 11/3 462 puts
dead cat bounce ?
It's Gucci in this sub. In other subs you may hurt some feelings
I don’t know this Brandon guy but based on the reactions of everyone cheering him on, he’s getting his ass kicked
doesnt have any trade momentum
I’m still holding but I kinda wanna lock gains
what's up with CAR? Why is it running?
Yeah its a cult that creams their pants whenever they see green whatd you expect
SPY RSI is higher than 70 all the way out to 14 days.
  
We better get at least a red week after this bullshit.
You mean when it reaches 10?
What  u mean? Was 1155 when I said it, now 1170. It bounced just as I expected
wonder whats the bottom for Zillow

the fact that it climbed out of previous dive and back to $100 was amazing in itself
[deleted]
But can you accept them, that is the question.
&gt; Is CNBC retarded?

Yes, always yes
theres no point in selling OCGN before the WHO meeting tmmrw. might aswell see what happens
$twtr puts , platform is trash
Pypl leap seems tempting here
ocgn what trash - gonna do the same shit as last week.  Got out at 15.3  should have dumped when it was 16

What’d he even tweet? Did he delete it?
Overall, he’s good for the stock
The momentum it has may be a bit before that 40% dip happens again if ever. If you hold long it doesn’t really matter where you get in.
Damn thought i had big brain from making money on novavax yesterday.

If they actually announce tapering with SPY rsi extended past 70 a 1.5% pullback on the daily wouldn’t surprise me whatsoever 

Then more calls

Wow what a funny and original comment
Thoughts on GME calls?
Is CNBC retarded? Yes, yes they are. Dude just said “Elon needs to just come out and say whether they’re selling Hertz the model 3’s at a discount or not”


Motherfucker his tweet explicitly says they’re selling them at the same prices consumers get
Of course, it was shelter from Telsa

When is earnings for it?
My hood calls -75% rn
Until it isnt
Yeah definitely
Is it worth it to buy weekly calls on VIX or should I just buy shares?

$TSLA PUTS FREE MONEY
I don’t think you can read bro. I’ll dumb it down “whenever Elon mentions other stocks, they get pumped. The moment he mentions his stock, it plummets the following day”

[deleted]
&gt; No, I mean the price of a stock will go up or down depending on what happens to it.
Should be pretty cheap for buying now, lmao
OOF
The only safe play is SPY and MSFT lol
1430 what
Is the BABA earnings date still this week or did it get pushed back to next week? I'm seeing different dates.
So you think that a post-bankrupt company ordering 100k teslas costing $4B was not laughable to begin with? And then they changed to 150k, as if they were ordering pastries from a bakery. Why not make it 1 million teslas, Hertz?
Over 1.221m TSLA option contracts traded, 56% call/44% put

The problem is so many people are piling into TSLA puts that it could create the basis for another blowoff top or a multi-week sideways move to burn all those premiums.

The TSLA short trade is getting as heavy as it's been in a long while...
On a scale of 1-10 how annoyed are you with PLTR
it kinda hit another ATH today even though I was expecting it to just be flat or down till merger
Buying spy puts is the GAYEST and most RETARDED thing you can do
I held through 40% drops, $60 ain’t chit chief
It's what I like to call a slump buster. Hope it works, LET'S GO BABY!
Tesla dip 🤑🤑🤑
That's my secret Cap, I'm always poor.
bought home recently so no
Resistance at ATH 😂🤡
SPY ready for another leg up
Weeklies a month out?

Whatever that means
For real, dam short sellers
Just get out. It’s dead. It’s to the point where it way too risky.
Also probably NCLH, but it's been so depressed in price along with airlines, it's probably a good long term buy.
I’m lazy and dumb so are there any companies similar to CAR with earnings coming up?
To the moon if the merger completes
Lost tendies on tesla puts from last week. It hurts knowing i have to work 4 weeks to get it back.
Algo: “Zillow selling 7000 homes raising red flags about real estate market”

Me: opens map of united states 

🤡👉🃏
Can we just get a nice dip back to 458?
NVDA $265’s
TSLA $1160’s
Can snap do something by 11/26 please
Tesla gonna go big green hulk Dick to close and run another 1-2% ah just for all you people who fomoed into puts.
It’s probably nothing
Only $100? Honestly probably moderate gains on SPY calls is your best bet

To ensure that $SPY ends the week well, I just bought some PUTs. You can thank me Friday when it is at $467+.
O\_O
is it almost time for SPY puts daddy
[deleted]
Nope. Not at all.
Nah. Going up 100% of the time is impossible. You gotta accept the loss as part of the game.
how the fuck are we at $462 on spy.  this market is fucked.
We have a different environment now. Shitty jobs will be guarantee to be gone by the next decade. Most people won’t be able to afford homes especially GenZ unless they get inheritance

To be fair I’m not the type to dive super deep on companies, but the fact that they’re opening a launch window next week and reporting earnings the next, along with a relatively stagnant price (at least for such a volatile stock) for the last 2 months, means that the move up is coming soon IMO
In 2024
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Damn CAR is really bouncing a bit, thats insane. Maybe theres hope for the $400+ bagholders today
Institutions are shaking out weak stop losses before the rocket ship tomorrow. Theyre buying all the perfect low positions. They did this last week and it redoubled back up w more institutional ownership
CARS &gt; CAR
It just dropped 60 bucks wtf you smokin
🙏🏿🙏🏿
Maybe Jerome will bring this thing down - or maybe he’ll pour gasoline on it. IDK. 1430 stay tuned.
I wanna be wrong but sorry folks lucid is going under 30 by eow, Tesla will be under 1100 eow great run on both
Of the last 2 weeks, today is the day you decided to make that bet?
Because it’s Moonvember
Lol true, I've made good profit on the shares anyways, would have been happy @$245.  Def worse problems haha.
Not just you… market fucking us all
from one bagholder to another, one bright spot from CHGG earnings call:

"We ended the quarter with approximately $**2.6 billion of cash and investments**, and as such we are navigating the current environment from a position of strength. We will use our balance sheet to create shareholder value, **which includes buying back securities during times of value dislocation** and to that end **we announced today that we have increased our securities buyback program by $500 million**. In addition, we believe the combination of our balance sheet and cash flows put us in the pole position to acquire assets should they become available at the right price."

For real he's gonna get popped for market manipulation one of these days
Market manip. It happened last week too. Don’t let it scare you if anything buy the dip
November 4th market sell off incoming
Bullish on UWMC ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Institutions always shake out weak stop losses before huge jump, it happened with MRNA right before they jumped from 20 to 14 to 350
TSLA seems to be the only stock Elon can’t pump. Every time he mentions it, it plummets
3 hours late to that party
Paya feel free to go up.
Someone gonna post CAR gains soon?
GME stabilizing and ready for next leg up
That’s enough DD for me.  I’m in.
even tho msft, amd, nvda, and aapl are alp up today, does it still make sense to buy some weeklies for about a month out?
SPY 530C 1/21/2022

I sell ATM or barely OTM.

I *want* to get assigned. Only in it to harvest volatility for guaranteed cash when no better plays are on the horizon.
Shopping malls...only thing keeping them open are the AMC and GME cults...lol
Tesla puts aint printing. I expected double but its barely up
Puts on SPY seem promising for tomorrow.
My entire portfolio shat the bed lmao. 

Down 3.34%. I mostly blame Kingsoft Cloud.
NVDA up another casual 3% lol
&gt;t

million dollar question
Trash. Who wants to work in an office these days?
Tomorrow afternoon bro
What the fuck happened with Avis??
SPY up 40% on the year god damn
Pretty sure it was Hertz that made the announcement. Tesla just kept their mouths shut.
My calls have been blood red all week, would love to see this baby turnaround continue
[deleted]
Yh, what happened to ocgn ?
Literally every move I make is the wrong move, statistically impressive
yeah i had some Nov/March NVDA calls and i took gains on.

welp..

well there are worst problems to have when ur OTM covered calls sold are ITM

you could be selling them naked heh
For a visa call 2 months out?? Holy shit. That’s free money.
I was told 🥭 ☕️ moon time. I’d like my money back plz.

2pm Tomorrow
Not sure if I'm more disappointed in PLTR or myself at this point.
Usually decays quickly..... sometimes spikes harder than tesla ever could.... 

This week, could be a fizzle, could be a big bang.  Probably not going to have unexpected enough moves to really ignite VXX though. 

Position: VXX 11/5 22c
NVDA gonna hit 300 before earnings? Jesus
You will be spared
Who gives a shit, this sub wasn't "almost sold out" it was sold out after GME.

Everyone knows wsb is compromised
Sure seems that way today.  Really would have though it would slowly climb all day into meeting minutes
didnt read the first comment but i second this motion
He hasn't fucked the stock this bad sinc even tweeted out "TSLA stock is too high IMO" lol
Fed doesnt matter, holdiay szn coming up, covid dying, optimism growing, bulls grazing
I'd wait for the end of the week to see what happens. Usually a huge drop followed by a flattening leads to at least a small pump in the coming weeks. You maybe easily be able to get out even.
If you didn’t realize that OCGN dip was pure manipulation you are fucking retarded
It’s too small. Better use a pinky instead.
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/MajorChances** bet **TSLA** goes from **1154.81** to **1400.0** before **2021-11-16 12:50:02.264566-04:00**

Yes pretty fuckin much. Do you hedge with ITM calls
How low will SQ go before earnings ?
I've never used it and don't know what it does so I am going to say yes.
Sorry didn’t realize you had autism I’m sorry.
Damn, all the retarded , most absurd OTM calls in some of the most retarded companies paid off big time. I guess I should start clicking the screen with my dick.
Starting to look real juicy
Except the market is nothing like 2007/2008. People aren’t getting shit mortgages anymore and aren’t getting approved for houses they can’t afford. 

Zillow is selling because they bought too much and over extended. With the supply chain issues they can’t flip the houses quick enough and are stuck with too large of an inventory.
Yeah wtf happened?
Anyone get lucky w Chegg?
Selling GME calls to idiots is a winning play 46 weeks a year
I dunno, earnings prob gonna be terrible and probably front runners selling but shit always seems to do the opposite of what makes sense
What’s good my Teslas! Just remember, never say that word with the hard R.
Any news on OCGN? Like, what happened? 😅
Earnings should be in the middle of the day to keep things interesting
TSLA green by close.
Meow
Try 300 per option
PROG possibly has bottomed out. Time to fly.
Oof man i feel you, i went in on AAPL and AMZN 1DTEs last week and watched my account fall off a cliff. Almost did the same today with TSLA but luckily there was enough FOMO left at open that i got out
HOLY fuck can OCGN just settle. This jumping and diving is too much for my soul.
Can aapl go to 153 today. I’m holding calls
No.
SQ probably gonna just go straight back up as evidenced by the roller coaster track it lives on
Flat until J Pow and than 1% green after he is pathologically dovish

That’s why people said in 2007 when the bubble popped. Zillow is selling 2 billion worth of homes on a lost. Automation and inflation will kill real estate sector

Are you going to be a re offender
Let's go TSLA. Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and keep running.
Someone's worried about those 210c
Even with fed taper?
Really hard not to sell these 11/5 462 calls and buy puts looking at that giant head and shoulders

You must have said that about SPG too, and look where it is now.

It's 12:45, where's the dump? Options are Nov 19, new stores are joining and they smashed earnings, if there's a dump, IF, it won't be for two weeks.
Whew! Almost made a shitton of money this week! Bullet dodged 😎

Don't have to stress about taxes if you only have losses.

Going to let my $TSLA puts ride. Already made up for yesterday's ass kicking but want more. This is going to be a homerun.
FinTwit is a bunch of pump and dumps
Just remember don’t gamble your rent money away

Great for day trading, easy money:)
Started the day up $1k, but luckily overtraded to red.
I'm curious if TSLA either rebounds by 5 to 10 percent tomorrow or turns out to be the ultimate bull trap and promptly drops to 900 dollars.
Lmao? Up 1% wtf
I've been averaging down on calls bought near the top all day lololol climbing out of a fucking hole why am I like this
Hey... Uh... guys.... don't look now, but CAR looks like it's trying to form a cup and handle after this mornings rip and dip.

hard disagree. In fact, if google glass was released today it would fly. Timing in market. Metaverse is somewhat of an expansion of google glass, and likely will provide a platform for similar technology's widespread use. Universal real-time translation and built in HUD here we come.

I hope someone bought that market manipulation dip
Just lookin out for fellow tards, be a shame if you end up behind Wendy's you know
I feel kind of stupid. I went all in TSLA 1250calls, saw a double, and didn't take the profit. Close for breakeven before it went red.
Currently $2243
Lol ocgn got cucked hard thank god I found the exit this morning.
Some people love giving their money to theta gang.
Remember, the D in EOD stands for “decade” 🤡
Thank you. I sold a while back when it went up to 11.72, got a couple more right at the bottom that are ticking away at a profit.. but just wondered if I was missing something / should be considering more.

You do not want to be on Zillow. $OPEN has 10x the upside and is actually making money. 

Please look at @rabois’s twitter and his likes to just get a quick idea. He is PayPal mafia, he’s public, and he’s pre-bragging earnings. $OPEN is going to be a multi trillion dollar company and this is the last chance to get in &lt;$10Bn
oh shit big bank plays
I was lied to
About time those bastards decide to invest in America
Bought back in OCGN at $14.12 fuck it, lets go back up and do it again.

Aka it’s already too late
Real estate isn’t going to crash. Prices are sky high because we’re sitting on 10 years of negligible residential development.

No way man trust me most people lose playing options, don’t let the few gain porns fool you
I'm loling at my SQ calls...get theta gang fucked
I forgot that was this year lmao.
TSLA just needs gap fill to 840 then we going higher! 📈📈📈
Y’all wanted a dip here you go. Right before the afternoon pump.
[deleted]
Scalping calls on tech for $90 is more fun than Theta ganging for $1000
Thoughts on chgg. Looks way oversold, ready for big buy ins tomorrow
Why market ded
AVIS. What a stock. A true car rental company. They don't leave you in the premarket lot because you're late by a minute. They wait for you to arrive and give you the ride of your life.
JNJ with that steady ass incline
yeah that may be a stretch LOL but even a 10% drop would be bank.  
I was also thinking NCLH
My current META call expires 12/17
Ocgn drop and bounce is all market manip it happened last week too. Embarrassing to the ppl that just sold everything
Ok we cool. Thanks for that. Take an updoot
In this market?  Nah my brain ain’t big enough for your idea
I've already doubled on my BB 14.5c 11/19. Guess I'll keep holding
Sold my Mara 52 calls yesterday 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Classy, OCGN.
He just paid off the next round of personal loans using his Options (to cheat the tax system) and now he needs the price lower in case the Billionaire Tax bill actually passes.  No reason to keep pumping it.
who knew nvax SHARES were the move for me to not be stressed lol
&gt; Dudes an addict with a left fascist Napoleon complex

this nerd controls the communication of the world. he was a low life hacker until his late 20s and now he is one of the most powerful men on Earth, regardless if you like him or not. Pretty admirable if you ask me.
If you happy with your profit  sell, Its a good profit.  You will be disappointed if it keeps dropping.  Put in a stop loss
Lol true true
Imagine buying TSLA at like $40 pre split and just holding like crzy
The more money in the port the better performance though right?
Im making money... 

NVAX baby!!! Get in it to WIN IT!!!

I’m glad I wasn’t too greedy with my tsla play this morning. Would’ve been down bad now
Ya man he’s so humiliated. So humiliated. Man…he must hate his life.
Bought calls at the top…How do get that card for the Squid Game?
Every dip gets bought
WTF AVIS? I gotta go read up on why
Every time you see a positive news article about any company anywhere?  You made money off that.  I’ve always liked that as an investing thesis
Ha! What?
Nah this isn’t a top. TSLA isn’t done yet.
probably NCL but i doubt anything is dropping 40% lmao
Anyone else feel like they're always the only one losing?
If markets retrace 2-3% which I expect they will before we finish rallying rest of year TSLA will be under 1000 again sell bulls
im thinking about NET puts but i haven't bought anything this week yet
It’s above weekly pivot. Monthly candle Is green
Me.  Bought a leap yesterday morning.  Still doing good.
For real though 😂 Nah I’m totally prepared for the stonks only go up wave to mess me up too
I got 5 Jan 2023 $CHGG $30 Calls for only $10 each. (5k total). Seems too good to be true. Way overblown reaction IMO
10%*
If I don’t see some LCID and TSLA loss porn this week after all y’all posting gains I swear we all know 100% of y’all didn’t cash in. SOMEBODY better post losses like WSB legends

No way. Might seem easy to say that now but VR is going to take over the gaming world and GTA is going to front run it some day. Facebook already getting San Andreas ported to oculus. Only a matter of time before the others get ported as well. A couple years from now GTA 6 will only be available on the Oculus
One red day and run is broken? TSLA is still at 1150
imagine not buying TSLA calls at the bottom of the month and then coming here laughing at people that's up 1000% while you're down your whole life savings of 50 bucks

Elon: “hmmm tsla seems to be moving nicely after 10 months, guess it’s time to torpedo it with a tweet everyone will over react to”
LOL...sorry man you are definitely in the wrong Sub.
I did. Doubled it. Sold. And happy
SQ calls is the play for this week
There's news, nothing huge just continued positivity. Don't mistake this is a great long term play. No meme
If I had enough cash I would be buying some more Tesla calls. Fuckers gonna rebound again hard
fr holy shit like a 20% drop in a minute
Any particular reason all of sudden AAPL gapping??
CHGG
Holy shit I called the top for once in my life. Sold my OCGN calls shortly after open
I meant ban the guy who said it would open higher
30 mil is pretty normal volume for TSLA
They will make it to end of week then post loss porn &amp; Elon hate threads
WARNING: TSLA is setting up another bear trap, buy the dip while you have the time
Spy is so annoying. You really have to just guess the correct direction at 9:30, but the appropriate option, and sell by 10:30
Lol that's almost funny, just grilled up some salmon and chicken yesterday with one of my several signature sauces. Haven't touched a drink since probably 2018, really don't care for alcohol. And yes I travel around the community some days for work taking care of sick children as a homebased mental health practitioner so I'm forced to eat on the road a couple days a week and the golden arches beats Johnny's Slop Shack anyday.
The catalyst happens tomorrow, wait until then, we dont even know the news yet and the stock has already doubled
🤤 DUUUUUUUUUUUH 💄😋
Breaking: fed to taper bonds to purchase TSLA calls
That was wild tho what happened?
I’m just an idiot watching OCGN dead cat bounce

Imagine buying TSLA calls after it pumped $500B in market cap in a month. LMAOOOOO
wrong way sofi
VMW shares magically appeared in my portfolio this morning. And are already making green dildos
TSLA pe 374 at a trillion+ market cap. You gotta be a retard to put money in that
Holy shit Tanger (SKT) just had a halt. 

Time to add more.
So your argument is that they won’t “start to lose market share” because things that start to lose them market share “just” happened?  Deeeerrrrrrrrppppppppppppppp
fucking OCGN market maniuplation bullshit. hold retards
🙏
I’m 🌈AF &amp; doing fine. Went long SPY @  433. Being 🌈 doesn’t mean u short everything all the time. It just means we pay attention. Pot odds. Poker, not roulette. All gambling. GL! 🍻
Look that the 15min chart today for SNAP lmao. Not one single green candle
Lmao
I understand how the market bid/ask determines the value of a contract. Just seems off that the market valued my contract at $2300 yesterday when the stock is at say $65. But today the stock is at $65 and the market is valuing my contract at $2230. Anyway bud appreciate the help
Tomorrow it skyrockets and lift off begins. Will it land at 80 or 100 or 120 or
Glad I didnt buy those calls I was hovering over😂... I saw +580% IV as a sign

Who bought Tesla calls at the top? Call volume was huge yesterday so I know some of you retards did
Haha yeah money has no value when it’s in the market. But charge me $30 bucks for some delivery pizza wtf is with that high ass price.
True
All too well, brother
OCGN ER leak or MM games?
Is DKNG the new PLTR?
TSLA is meme stock. Valuation is based on nothing
Tesla bears are just angry that gme has major ED
It's not going up again the near term
Yup
Pit your head between your legs and hope it rallies in the next three days!
It'd be absurdly overpriced at half the price.
I was a bag holder for almost a year. Sold all my shares Friday before close for a profit.
Somebody get the defibrillator for TESLA this is bullshit elon you owe me some money Pig
Well right now the plan is to wait until Friday so I can buy it back almost worthless and pocket all the stupid Ape money. Then I can sell the shares.
Well congrats on ur genius
Rotation into value just beginning ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Well fuck. I guess I should have been more patient.
Why Elon tweet bad things when stock doing well. Why sir why.

The metaverse is FB's Google glass moment.  It is going to be a gigantic multibillion dollar mistake.
Hold till 800%
I buy options yesterday everything goes red tonight. Feels like it’s all going according to plan
HUT calls tho 👀 

Just a casual 90% gain since last week
What earning are you playing today?
MMs havin a good ole time w/ OCGN. FOOOOOK!
Why you wanna hurt me? What price do you show car as opening?
Keep your money until tomorrow
actually

Today: TSLA bears trying to find the bottom and about to get blown up

real bulls hold until 2030
Rip to OCGN, hopefully tomorrow it prints
TSLA still absurdly overpriced
TSLA bulls should be back from their lobster/bourbon lunches soon

Any news for the OCGN drop?
Bought NVDA calls for the first time at open yesterday and they're up 75%. What to do, what to do
OGCN puts? Lol. Ppl were pumping that here all week.
Here's your entry for OCGN
META and UPWK
Fukin guh ocgn
Tomorrow near close. I think a hour or two before or something.
Call the broker to get a refund. You probably got an expired product
Saying you don’t see color is like a third grader fantasy world response, hence people not liking it
check the volume
u tellin people literally signals the top is in lmao
Anyone wanna explain how OCGN dropped like 20% in a minute?
I can’t believe someone just said their food is “quite edible” lmao. Alcoholics eat anything.
Tesla fell on its face lol what a dumb overinflated shit. A big business deal makes the stock raise like 30 percent when it only raised revenue like 10 percent, GTFOH lol see you back at 1k
Might as well go home kids they pumped up to major resistance levels now making the Fed dump it 

They’re playing chicken right now 

Market ain’t moving till tomorrow
Stop loss raid?
Red Light Red Light Red Light. It seems like wsb traders are getting shot
Ocgn pulling that same shit as last week. Piece of shit

OCGN good lord, am glad I sold at 15.90, CHECK out the drop 😂 perfect buy soon
OTM calls on tilrry earnings :)
Do you think it’s ever going back up? Lol
Call your broker get a refund if you do it fast enough
You’re supposed to hold till it’s worthless. Thanks for coming ✌️
Tanger at resistance line of previous yearly high, just need a few more people to nudge. Skt! Skt!

I'm talking calls for ER or leaps
&gt; I'm not a moron.
Wow dude Tesla gonna shit the bed like that after all that
Only thing good today was OCGN puts. Wow, who could have guessed after hitting 15.80 it was going to plummet... literally free money.
TSLA bro. You were supposed to gain 5% today, not lose 5%. I already told everyone. You’re making me look like a lying bitch.
[deleted]
In relative terms my friend. I am already looking forward to another entry when it presents itself
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
LMAO I just saw OCGN dropped from +10% to minus 10% in minutes. HOLY, luckily I did not buy calls yet. May consider now
Why is BB gaining more steam with such low volumes? Have I missed something? There appears to be no news and trading is slow.
Right? Dude isn’t up to speed
Ocugang in shambles
im just about giving my last breath now Margin call %80 in heavy position. Any expert suggest what to do at this situation???????
What the heck is going on with Avis? How did it jump so much today?

Hi WallStreetBets. I’m new to investing and bought a Tesla call out of recommendation of some of your users. I was just wondering what why the value of my call is -60%. Is there something I can do about this? Thanks.
As is 24….and 22….and 19….
Just say you have a friend that's colorblind 😎
Love the 💀 🐻 corpses I’ve been walking all over the past 2 weeks

Tesla just opened its charging to other brands and GM just closed a deal last month for charging infra.  We get you SEC, but at least pay a slight bit of attention.
Anyone playing ATVI earning? What’s your take?
Some poor sap get margin called on CHEGG? Family office our of business? 🤡
Every fucking time I touch TSLA it dies come on
What dank basement did you hear that in?
Ban for bad info
Cause chegg is crashed?

/u/Grishen why did you even bring up the penny stock thing with me again if you don't actually have any point to make about it except "I explained everything this one time and you ignored it I swear but I won't dig up a link or explain again or anything because it's not worth talking about with you"

Having some conflicted feelings about me there I see
Is OCGN done ?
So saying colorblind is offensive and racist now apparently. Where and when does this stop?
What just happened? Ocgn jumped off a cliff
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
OCGN just dropped like 2 dollars holy fuck
Love that all the bulls that went from 2k to 20k in a week will have $400 next week, if they’re lucky. 😂
Whats FB?

Holeeeew fuk OCGN, lolzzzz
WOW you can no longer click on a tweet without an account, I keep getting a twitter pop up. fuck you Jack I liked you but this was the last straw.
Yeah because people actually like going outside, who knew?

And even if the "metaverse" was/is a good idea, Zuckerberg is the last person that the general public would want in charge of it except maybe bezos 😂
Keep dumping TSLA 🥰
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/WarrenBuffett420 (0/1) made a bet that DWAC would go to 100.0 when it was 70.35 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
FB PLEASE GO UP! I'm leveraged to the tits
I really have no idea tbh but it did drop to 1162, then a dip to 1140, and then another dip back to 1162. 


Now it’s broken down below 1162 though so all bets are off

5k to 40k in 1 week on TSLA last week and than GME today
Metaverse giving us cheap 📞 for the ride to the MetaMoon. Thanks, Zuck. You freaking wierdo...
I'd be interested in a poll of who exactly is gonna spend their days in virtual reality. Unless they can give me an SAO experience where I can tell my boss I got trapped, it isn't going to be something I do a lot.

From my time in Nigeria witnessing the rise of Afrobeat under Fela Kuti, (me and Ginger Baker still roll ecstacy to this day, he faked his death to take over for Whitey) I can tell from you're tone of voice that you grew up on a Vietnamese rice paddy and were likely molested by missionaries. I'm afraid you may be suffering from undiagnosed liver flukes, it is very rare that otherwise accomplished and sacred beings would allow themselves to fall into the disgusting *heathen* world of chargepoint FDs. u/deSeingalt and I collaberated on a dissertation of the long term psychological repurcussions of undiagnosed liver disorders and parasites, which won a Tony for best screenplay. Please send feet pics, I believe it to be in you're best interest that we compile your experience to improve our products and services, as well as your health and mental wellbeing.
As someone with a few hundred shares, probably nah. Looking for profit taking, not adding.
Ain’t nobody had calls on that shit prior to earnings. They all bought today at 450
Short TSLA for us
BROS coming back to earth again. Buy the dip or wait till after earnings ?

Literally had to google who that was lmao thought it was a Pokemon
Nothing is priced in with this market
Please do it for us. Make it moon again
$CHGG Looks like an overreaction here. It should definitely be back above $35+ and probably $40+ in about a week 🧐
That’s why I got long exp homie
Yolo on it and post loss porn pls
Or it could hit $40 you never know
Guilty or not guilty
$38.5
Smart, why didnt you dm me to do the same 😭

Thank god for the bull rush this morning
It was $100 a few weeks ago after hitting an ath of $120. Shoulda bought in then you ham sandwich.
We can all agree on that
Next level autism. Learn letters next.
I read some of your recent posts, loss checks out.
Fuck it I’m selling TSLA.

Could it be?
Lmao…ya never know…could hit $80 by Friday 🥲
Oh shit probably

I didn't know any of this but I've been here since jan. I thought the decline was due to the sec report
It will be the literal minute you buy in. Just watch
Do you guys think the Fed tapering talks are already priced in?
Not GME which is still up over 500% YTD?
Same, currently in a holding pattern with $SPY and $F. both basically do nothing today.
My god it feels great to have sold basically the exact top at $1200. Was second guessing myself yesterday AH when it kept running but that sweet validation today tho 😌
TSLA calls bought at the beginning of the year are prob down still
F has been a great performer this past year. I'm inclined to agree, their p/e ratios are still in the toilet despite moving into the EV space, having the actual means to produce at scale, and already shipping millions of non-EV vehicles.
Not with that attitude
What the hell are you talking about? Who ya talkin to?!
Rivian ipo should be interesting too
Holy shit you’re right, how is a stock gonna tank so bad from earnings? That’s just pathetic
Legal claim? He'll have to make it through our crack team of lawyers first.

Already watching this one closely, waiting for a dip for below $320.
Fuck that ! Tesla $1200+ end of the week suck my cock 😤
Stock will be back to $2 in a couple years
China and Germany are making EVs in volume, not Ford and GM.

Shocker
I'd start with acknowledging you don't have it as bad as you think you do. People can live comfortably around 25k with children. Sales is very transitional, if you have sales experience you can move into a lot of different sales positions of various things. You're also 26, you'll be fine

Any reason to be bullish on FB? Seems like I’m retarded and bought the top today

What do you have for qualifications
Elon could go to jail for securities fraud and the tesla bubble still wouldn't pop.
What do you have in mind for them?
If u want EV buy Ford or GM. They will slowly but surely take TSLA market share for the next 5-10 years. TSLA will never be a monopoly this is a good thing btw

I'm not following the logic here. If I dismissed it with my psychotic ramblings back then, why not dig it up and prove that? Seems to me like you're just making shit up and hoping my memory won't be good enough to call you out on it.

$CAR what the fuck is happening
Say it again, made it bounce a little.
So your call is priced by the current going price of the contract which loosely corresponds to the price of the stock. The price you are seeing isn’t the stock price but the last sell on the current contract bid

So at that moment your contract was priced loser because the last sell of the contract was roughly lower proportionally than what it was for the increase
Cash out while you can
Reddit should just sue his ass.
Build a wall. Make him pay for it.
So he can pump it when the deal is signed.
You just bought the ath. No biggie. Buy high, right?

All stocks like $CAR that are doing same revenues as 2019 are up 300% - 1,500% higher than 2019 price. The crash will be sweet when it comes

Who ever bought my Tesla 11/5 1375 calls for 600 this mourning, get fucked
I lost 5k and it seems like a video game cause I didn’t really react.

How on earth was Zillow $200 last year LMAO

I don't think you know what a dead cat bounce is. Or a rug pull. It is up 45% in the last month alone, and 200% for the year.
... so was Ford
#THETA GANG STEALIN
It seems like they couldn’t do the renovations fast enough and are selling to avoid the carry cost.
Still wondering why Elon even said what he said..
Got 13k in RH, what should I buy
Ain’t that the cold hard truth…
No point in selling these Tesla call for a near 100% loss guess I’m holding fucking Christ
Yes probably they are literally in the business of college fraud
The house always wins it’s always been like that :( casino rules

Tsla moons till I get calls LMAO
Have you ever jacked off an entire day from being stressed about losing 5k in a day?
Solid DD.
Way too unrealistic to think TSLA that doesn’t earn no where near as much as Ford or GM will run the show. It just simply won’t happen. All companies will succeed hence TSLA will slowly lose value over 5-10 years as it has other competitors take market share
Bought my first call on COIN a few weeks ago...Mar 18 '22 $400. Guess that first hit of the good stuff is what does you in later on lol.

CHGG went boom boom today. Red 45%. Boss man said people no school this year. Enrollment bad. Less students less $ for CHGG. 2022 more people go school = more money for CHGG. Green good for apes. Leaps = calls 1yr out or more. Buy leaps low today. Sell high when students return to school.
It’s not a dip lol

We had this “conversation” before. I produced a sec definition of a penny stockfor you. This definition is important because these stocks are regulated in certain ways. You dismissed it with your psychotic ramblings back then too so I’m not going to dig it up again, try google maybe.
Is $CHGG dead?
That is so fucking accurate 😂
Is CAR done dying? I would like to see it go down to $200 or so today. Not sure I want to close my short positions yet.
Lmao totally understand. Congrats on the gains though man!!
SoFi is a wannabe hipster of a company. Terrible customer support. In 2019 it’s a $5 stock
Is Zillow in buy territory now?
And here you are, whining.

TardCoin?
Lmao buying that at 550. People are astounding.
‘Dip’ that is still ATH.
Hey, how we doing out there tonight? Ha ha, yeah… I am not doing good
Setting aside 10-20k for Rivian's IPO next week.. I'm not really a truck guy but even I want that shit.
Holy fuck I just looked at the CAR chart... Good fucking lord. Who banked on that? There aren't even options available to buy otm rn
Cash, UVXY calls and long stock headed into tomorrow’s meeting
Discord is annoying to sort through, the YouTube channel breaks down all the different option strategies and hes got tons of good knowledge
You expect this market to be rational?
TSLA stock too high IMO
So as soon as I buy TSLA calls after everyone making bank the next day Hurtz updates with bad news like WTF
I’m down like 5% w/e
I made some moneys and got out. Too scared the retard strength will return after lunch
What a fucking dumpster fire this is
Dude, relax. We are up 50% in the last month, and now taking a breather. For fuck sakes.
My 5 dollars was worth the sacrifice
Z goes on buy-unseen frenzy in a housing bubble even frothier than the crisis of 08.

Then is now forced to panic sell $2.8B in homes to tutes for cheap.  How to see these things coming?

Or maybe I listened to the hype one time and lost money and got wise.

Plot twist, Hertz order is already priced into TSLAs supply demand, and Elon just pissing off his #1 customer.
I'll look into him, im apart of a stock dads fb/discord group they've got alot of good info
snapchat just fucking die already
Nvda ready to go again
Cliff diving
Hey u/tonylix, how's that GME 300 banbet going?
Yeah im honestly just happy i was able to get away with most of my TSLA profits. Everything else has just been fucking around cus im bored but thats so dumb lol
Fucking insane this pump and dump
Such a shill
meta cheap as dirt rn
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Yea if he said $400-500 I would’ve been down but this guy is a degen and not the good kind.

Fuck it you’re right.. I’ll eat when I’m dead
$RKLB will have at least 5 rocket launches before EOY, going back to $20. Easiest 33% I will ever make. 

holding 7k shares until January 3rd for tax purposes but it's going to be nice to start the year with atleast 30k profits when it reaches $20 minimum
You greedy greedy piggy
Fuck you FB you deplorable sack of shit. Fucking lizard dude can’t do shit right evidently. Fuck this market and fuck this shit.
PHO has done pretty well except when it shit the bed in October, which it has mostly rebounded.
Then you can’t sell and might need to exercise
That's not a crash. Thats a collapse. You wouldn't be able to spend your $500 gain.
TSLA puts printing 🥰
Oh the hurt. I feel so stupid today
I just did haha, go for it

Sell half
Seems evident that Hertz owns TSLA stock.

Some mens bottoms are only for tops.
Car wasnt even a meme stock before today
Tesla people:

Yesterday: I would literally serve up my asshole for Elon’s pleasure.

Today: why do they let Elon have social media.
Big time. So we can buy in when it sub $30 again
Pretty amazing and yet true.
I get a lot done in those 1-2 hours
Nah a 2-3% pull back is likely before we rally rest of year
Check out the [second sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql73dk/he_who_must_not_be_named_product_of_nepotism_to/) post if you don't know the story of how the sub was almost sold out from under us before GME happened. From our own personal deepthroat.

Apparently Jaime Rogozinski still feels he has some legal claim to this community and plans to not only team up with someone to launch a shitty crypto under our name, but wants to also claw back the community and use it to scam again.

Yes.
Wait for this next big market dip, then buy dis calls for jan
Do we just grab calls on anything again? My nvda 275 gonna print

I would too if I didn't know how to use the correct your

They were dirt cheap, so I couldn't resist. Thought it might have another sudden pop. Turns out it did, but just split across a coupled days. Thems the breaks.
Wish I knew how to read before buying it.
Considering how earnings have been going the past few weeks, im heavily considering buying puts on CELH.
Facebook.... why you keep doing this :,(
The SEC doesn't have the authority to change the definition of a phrase that has nothing to do with them. What makes you think they do?
TSLA 1150 eod I think
&gt; I don't talk about stocks that are not publicly traded.
COUR is the next -20%er I think
Is “my kid is ill” a good excuse to miss work?
MRK keep goin or secure the tiny bag
Don't forget the short ETFs like SH, far less gains than puts but it's not like they expire and we all know SPY will pull back at some point.
Any life changing stock to buy like tsla ?
Buy the $SPY dip?
=| It's drilling
F
I’d be worth like 20million if that happened
No you're right it was a split share.
[deleted]
Lmao dude this is uncanny. I got one last daytrade and I’ve been eyeing gme for a swing too😂 and hut. But my coworker called me and helped me realize I’m probably just wasting my time right now. So now I’m trying to stay occupied while I’m up 2% for the day before I fuck it up lol
🤖No bots allowed here cuckerberg
Just let LCID die already
What stops visual mod from cussing like a misogynistic neo Nazi?
Buy a share of something instead
Buy calls further out… wait…. Profit?
Cooling off over an overhyped bull run? I don't understand TSLA at all, I'd be hesitant to buy at half the price, so for all I know it'll double by EOY.
$510+ EOY
Markus Heikotter or whatever his name is on youtube really good to learn options from
Maybe 20 minutes ago
I’d really enjoy that personally. Might be a BIT overshooting tho
LCID boys rekt
It’ll prob be 1100 eow
i got in pagaya , its upst on steriod trading at 8 billion marketcap
NO
upvote if you hate youre life
Sure, but why is my call down about the same on a 1.15% drop as a 2.15% gain I would of thought it would be pretty relative, thanks for the help
Thoughts on azure power? Everything I’ve found screams yes but it’s down and idk why
Sorry my baddd.
SEC changed the definition to be under $5, per https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennystock.asp
GME 🥺 go higher

Me
Both Chinese pieces of shit. Buy TSLA and stfu.
I hope TSLA bulls took their gains. 100 billion market cap on a measly 3-4 billion dollar deal that isn’t even set in stone shows the stupidity of those buying at these levels. TSLA will drop below 1000 very soon. It’s a good company but it’s no AI leader except in EV and it’ll never monopolize the EV market 5-10 years from now. It’s a 200-300 dollar stock.
Nice. I wish I had the ability to short shares. I probably do but I’m ignorant of how to do it.
I'm bag holding Tesla calls that were up 150% yesterday 🐷🤡
Elon seems like a time traveler who knows if his stock gets too high, too soon, the TVA like in Loki will come looking for him.
Wow thank you BB shills, very cool!
Up 2 days in a row.
I'll definitely look into it, I started trading in Feb so I'm still very new, but im learning
The refractory period, SPY is a morning coomer
That’s comparing last year height of the pandemic to this year. Not a great comparison. Q3 2019 revenue was 2.75 billion, however EPS was $3 non GAAP
Call me when Pornhub has filed their Metaverse patents
gonna grab some meta calls on this dip
I am once again asking for your financial support
Wasn’t a 50% fall though. Split shares with a spin-off
boooooooooo
more people are going back to school next year so more people will need to cheat.
I'm hoping so
The only bad part of being 🌈 is u have to pay attention. Thanks, Elon!
That is bullshit. Wonder why? Margin? Fidelity wasn't limiting me.
I just don’t see TSLA ending in red today tbh
Then download something fun?
Spy daily fade is the only guarantee in life
&gt; I don't care.
SPY hitting ATH right before fomc meeting where they undoubtedly will start tapering is so 2021.
Aight since the Ber talkin shit i bought a single 330p 11/22.

They convinced a crash is coming it better fucking crash.

I still think they're wrong tho
It's how they roll, talk a big game but never deliver. Cults
Up 9% today idk
Market is efficient, SPY 500
IDK why I covered my CAR short at 350. That thing is on the elevator down
A lot of my coworkers at Sonic back in the day would do something like this. Whenever a customer paid with cash, they would go back and alter the order by taking things off the ticket. Made out like literal bandits until the store closed.
BB orange juice jug of wisdom coming through
Bulls think tapering is when you tape your dick to your own ass so you can admire yourself in the mirror.
HeDgEe MaNiPuLaTiOn!!!
Alright look Elons tweet was bullish, the bears are trying to flip it bearish to give them confidence on their puts. Rip bears, rip puts , rip shorts tsla going to the moon and if your short on tsla your probably retarded
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
Inverse that joker
Is it possible.... That... They might.... Find something.... That could..... Change the course of history.... Forever?

I am not buying puts on $DIS cause I love Christmas.

I triple dog down on my sailing the seven seas for that show.
I started options trading in Feb also, it's tough to find those good ones. ASTR could be a 3 to 10 in the next month if their launch goes well and SENS could be a 10 bagger by EOY on calls
I don't know if this is some new paradigm for markets or we're going to look back on this time in ten years and think wtf.
Cramer saying stocks were unstoppable signaled the stop.
Im just gonna keep buying nvda calls till it stops working. Non stop money printer.

Oh damn nice rug pull algos

Momentum is not really the word, the volume is shit

Haha it just serves as confirmation of the narrow minded lack of understanding of the stock market that 99% of this sub has.
CoNgrats to me the greatest GOAT

HAD TO FORCE SELL MY PUTS AND I SEE MARKET DROP
TSLA is not a bad company at all but it doesn’t even deserve a quarter of its valuation atm. People are pricing in years of earnings
did you offer to pay for their covfefe?
Iv crush.
Holding for a year is for people who can afford slow gains. The system is rigged.

Yeah but it could be either direction

GME pawmpp and circlering pawmppp

so NIO had lowest deliveries this month significantly, and XPENG killed it but ?    i'm starting to think you guys only buy brand name stocks.
Elon: Hertz contract talks going well.
GME volume looking good today
Why? That wouldn't annoy as many retards, and if it turned out I'm the retarded one (lmao) it wouldn't give as many smart people the chance to educate me. Is there some reason it would be worth it? What's your thought process behind the suggestion?

Is it wrong that that got me just a little hard?
The reason why people here are confused about CAR is because it was a Facebook meme stock that even had groups coordinating the jump. It was mentioned here a few times but it passed on while people were focusing on Clov and CLF.

Plus by the time I knew about it the options were sky high so it would have been too late to enter a couple days ago anyway unless you went 5x margin.

Went uppies, now going downies...
Damn, FB cratering as much as it rocketed.
2 bagger maybe?
Sorry guys I bought a Tesla call, I have bad luck
Don’t ever change
They cured cancer duh
Same but then made a small profit on GME, then lost about the same in SPY calls and had to ask myself "wtf am i doing?" Then got back out.

Was wildin' out a bit cus im getting day trade restricted after today but not worth it rn

$1.50 is "mooning" now.
bag holders were decided
Imagine buying TSLA on Hertz news and the deal isn’t even set in stone. Lots of retail retards gonna be rich and holding bags on TSLA. It’s a 200-300 dollar stock realistically. It’s AI doesn’t compete with Nvidia and it will NOT monopolize the EV industry. There will be other competitors

taper in december, rate hikes vague market slightly red or super green, depending on how they phrase it
It went up
Just message him you dumb cunt
I did, though I didn't get in as high as I wanted.. Should've gone in at 500+. T212 limited shorts to 10 stocks though which sucks
I’m sorry guys, I blame myself for TSLA today. Decided to buy in at the top and the fucker sank like Jimmy Hoffa.
Why didn't you just sell short? Was so easy.

WSB, where you're wrong because you're green.
Can someone tell me wtf happened with CAR
You overpaid homie. Short the stock next time.
I was thinking about overthinking on this market
Well, they're not a leader in GPUs/compute, Apple just showed what's capable of in-house ARM designs, and big tech is moving in-house for their datacenters. Not sure I'd want to own AMD when you could buy INTC for like 10 earnings or something dumb.
Yah Fed is done with bonds. Moving on to deflationary purchases of TSLA and CAR equities. /s
yessir its dipping now so heres your chance
I always "pictured" Cathie as more of a power bottom.
My 33p hopes so
Sweet my poots went from -30% to -25% 😤 we out here.
Agree with that. could also be a possibility. They might be wanting to cash in on their investment before any rate increase happens.
Blindly following this advice
Shh you and I are the only ones who know abour options here.
It's not gonna fall until next year at earliest imo.  We got at least one more trip to $300
Then go ask the hedgies to pump it again, clown
Predictions for the meeting tomorrow?
You go short on this yet?
Should I play the OCGN earning this week?
Apparently my half a page of questions was too long for /u/Grishen so I'll just go one question at a time.

Since you say you already answered this question earlier, but I don't see your answer to that nor an answer to me asking you where you answered it: I repeat, where did you explain what's retarded about defining "penny stocks" as those under $1 rather than those under $5?
Next time sell a far otm put imo cash covered or spreads.  Usually with squeezes its better to be a seller.
Wait.. I didn't think it was a drop, I saw someone saying they'd spun off part of the business and issued current shareholders shares in the new company, is that not right?
It’s gonna be red until you sell then it will probably hit 1500.
When you bought a call spread, but it's looking kind of dead,
diarrhea, diarrhea.
You can almost see the exact time when i fomo into Tim apple.
Fuck you bot SENS was supposed to be $4 2 months not 1 month you bot fuck
All it takes is one thing to move Tesla another 100.
You are weak to the temptation of the flesh. It's nothing to take pride in and your egotistical stance of masculinity is an ironic excuse for your fragile lack of self control and discipline.

I want to agree with you but there has to be some sort of pull back before EOD.

Nope. They are just over extended, bought too much in a short period. Add in the supply chain issues, they can’t flip and get materials quick enough.
It has fallen 200$ but my puts havent gone up wtf?
even the stuff that everyone knows is coming is not priced in.

When I worked at Chuck E Cheese I used to steal kids tickets and tell them they didn't have enough to get the cool RC car.

The person doing inventory was the same guy who puked in the rat helmet, so they never caught on.  
  
What a cuck job that was I can't believe I ever worked there. Way happier now at Dave N Busters.

Best Buy got busted several years back for having an intranet site they could pull up in store with fake prices or something like that. Retailers wild yo.
Exactly.  Complete denial
Dude wtf is this incoherent bullshit gtfo
I hope your calls expire worthless maggot
I think they just don't have the personnel and infrastructure to manage all that. I mean, it's 7k homes they're trying to dump to other corporate buyers, who themselves would only buy if they saw profit potential. Since their stock has been spiraling, they might be compelled to show some immediate green on the balance sheet.
I tried to do another at 565 and it baaaarely didn’t get there. Wish I’d just shorted more at 500
I like how people say: "If I could go back in time I would have bought XYX stock knowing what I know now"....   Ummm, If I could go back in time even 5 minutes,   I could   leverage any volatile move in the stock market on ANY security to make life changing money.
Yes, I bought the TSLA dip

I think a FOMO press conference would be better.
6% at a loss from same quarter purchase in a sellers market is a huge indicator to me at least. Gonna see how tomorrow plays out I’m just making my guess at best, I don’t have any positions I wanna see what unfolds more.
Been cash gang. Just think of it as dry powder to buy the dip

Whoops forgot my wallet
I have 5 questions for /u/Grishen and I will not accept the sounds of gargling on Uncle Sam's dick as answers so try not to mention the SEC.

1. Since you say you already answered this question earlier, but I don't see your answer to that nor an answer to me asking you where you answered it: I repeat, where did you explain what's retarded about defining "penny stocks" as those under $1 rather than those under $5? 
2. What is the point of having the phrase "penny stock" available to use in the English lexicon? Like WHAT USE does it have as a phrase?
3. What does a penny have to do with it in your eyes? Why is the word "penny" part of the phrase?
4. What makes your answer to questions 2 and 3 so valuable to you that you need the phrase "penny stock" and you need to use the word "penny" in it and you're justified taking it away from people who want a phrase for stocks that are under a dollar so that they can specifically refer to stocks that are the absolute cheapest in the market, that can't move in increments less than 1% without trickery, that may be at risk of delisting - you know, stocks where the price per share being what it is actually matters and there's actually a fucking point to being able to communicate about it with a simple 2 word phrase?
5. Do you just believe whatever's convenient for your fee fees even if you have no explanation for it, and then get insecurities and cognitive dissonance slowly building up the deeper you get into delusion, until you try to make yourself feel better about how retarded you are by trolling people who are smart enough to have a basis for each of their opinions?
MMs think I'm scared of losing money

I haven't seen money even after 30 years.

TSLA sucks now that I am actually in it and bought the top

Don't sell your shares dumbass. They internalize every trade to match buy and sells over time. How they keep the price flat.

I sold the top of that CAR shit. Short positions at $500, $415 and $391. I am loving this.
Had a dream of massive returns on some calls but can't remember the ticker I saw
just got off work. what’s the play fuckers?
They’re panic selling a bunch of homes they just bought under market value right now. Pretty much with all the leverage debt in the housing market if the fed really starts throwing the gas on interest rates the whole thing goes boom. Seems like that’s the likely outcome.

that's not even that farfetched. I know it was proven to be the case for target.

If you’re not buying SPY puts before Fed meeting tomorrow you hate money.  EU already taking rate along with other govts hinting at it.  Inflation is here.  Money supply is astronomical.  We will see a sharp correction this week.

Same but I need 369 coming from 301 so I can make a new 420 bet
TSLA goes up an easy 100 on the day.... CAR squeezes to 500, GME up random 10 and 20 here and there....me, the palantard.... hey... up .44 cents looking good...yup...looking good.
2 days.  Yikes.
Stop trying to equate fundamentals to Tesla.  What's the margin on a model 3?  $5K?  That's $500mm in profit.  Stock went up $400 billion in market cap.  They could have ordered 1mm cars and it wouldn't make sense.  Just ride the technical cult wave and enjoy.

It is not as expected as you think.
Those puts I got on $CAR were not worth it. The premium is eating any possible gain unless this thing drops below $250 :(
Maybe all it needed was me to get a margin call for TSLA to go red
Buy SDC now or after earnings?
Disagree.  We are at ATHs.  The beginning of liquidity draw down is not priced in.

Even if it returns to pre pump 180 ish that's a big win down from even 400

Conspiracy theory:

I tried to do it for GME/AMC but think or swim wouldn't allow me during the huge runup.
Right… and HOOD really are poverty stocks
That’s why we short the stock instead of poots
It's called IV crush. Only ever do put debit spreads when a stock is being squeezed like that if you want to catch the downside.

CAR has 98% of float available to trade, most of which is owned by ETFs and large asset managers. That means it is an extremely easy to borrow security and there are a lot of owners who are willing to sell at these insanely inflated prices. Naked shorting is not to risky for this IMO, but if you really can't stomach unlimited losses then buy some short dated puts, because this baby is going to crater. Good luck everyone!

Edit: I also forgot to mention the market cap is already very high at $24M so I don't imagine an AMC or GME run up is possible because its already well above their maximum market cap during peak squeeze. I.e. there is only so much dumb money chasing squeezes these days.
TAN is an ETF that has had bonkers returns over the last couple years.

If you're betting on Mad Max future, PHO is a water ETF, consistent gains.

I could say the same of TSLA. Most overpriced garbage stock for a mediocre company I've seen in a long time. At least GME has the possibility to squeeze, and I'd argue, has has an inflated price because of an ongoing squeeze.

Yeah, but you have an exit strategy. I wasn't gonna hold if it went to $800 or some stupid shit. You could see it losing steam man. Tesla has a great product and is innovative. Avis fucking went parabolic on an earnings beat. They are still just a rental car company now competing with Uber and Turo.

You never answered me asking you what's retarded about setting the threshold at $1 instead of $5

But you don't seem to have realized you're the retarded one either

What gives? You just believe shit for fun even if you can't come up with an explanation for why?
Puts on car hopefully the shorts can do something
Did Jay Powell announce to his billionaire friends that he’s actually going to increase QE instead of decrease it? And they have the inside scoop already?
&gt; It's the end of the month and traders are trying to get out before their commissions kick in
Where's the jump for TQQQ coming from??

Missed out on my fill again.
I think the MSM confused things. There was no deal or contract, Hertz was just buying a fleet of Teslas
LCID ready for 40+...
SPY making 30 cent moves before lunch for no reason?
Still high af off that endorphin rush of selling UAA for 1000% gains this morning. Patiently waiting for a good point to sell these LCID puts
I told y’all AMC would moon. Especially after the 8th
$TSLA gave you 3 good call buying opportunities today. If you didn't seize any one of those, then I really don't know what to tell you ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Car $260 weeklies up 12,000% nice
Yo someone should have mentioned CAR before the pump so I could have dumped
What the fuck is up with CAR? Just woke up dff
I think we see a 10% bounce for earnings, not gonna lie
Tempted to just sell these $455p and $457p Wednesday puts at a loss
Do y'all think Burry has realized the market is completely fake yet
I’m not tired of you at all, I can’t get enough of you getting triggered by the definition of penny stocks 🤗
SPY has to pull back right? Isn't the Fed supposed to confirm tapering or some shit today &amp; tomorrow
I remember Tanger. Just got 3 calls 11/19 $21
I'd like to wait until Friday close please

up 30k on nvda calls expiring next week, what a rush
Yeah I remember it, one of my best shorts, made 30% in like 4 weeks.
one more pump before the dump
DEEZ NUTZ LOL GOT EM
Lil uzi fingers look like some backwoods
Jokes on my I already sold for a profit.
I been scooping up shares since the announcement of split haha

I dont listen to reatrds anymore, its the reason why i didnt buy tesla at $300 pre split but 

Ended up paying $550 post split average
I don’t think there will ever be a red day again
SPY 500 end of year is actually not a meme
SPY looks unstoppable
I might never buy a SPY put again
These small, consistent daily gains are gonna make me think I know what I'm doing. That's when it's going to go to shit.
Yesterday the mods changed it to something about Elon Musk's dick and I cried a little. So glad to have the Zeppelin flair back
Frank Zappa hated the Velvet Underground and drugs lol.
$amzn 2900 puts 10dte are very cheap! Maybe I should grab some
I want it back to 1k where it belongs after this stupid meme pump

I bought Lucid at 35 $ :(
Guys it’s tomorrow when the fed speaks on inflation and the economy?
IMO TSLA has bottomed today. Be prepared to see all those that bought puts receive the “your TSLA put has lost more than 20%” notification in 3…. 2…. 1…..

Lucky you
What in the fucking CAR! is going on.
Had a good chance to buy your TSLA calls there guys.
THESE ARE NOT CARS, THEY ARE TRANSFORMERS
Are you okay?
I'm in options there is no all time, are you drunk? Lol. Of course it's today what else would it be?
Side 1 holds up, damn.
DM 🚀🦾  been waiting for this to run!!!!
#Pro tip


Buy CAR calls that are up 10000% to secure 20000% in future gains.
COIN just keeps on giving
Zillow. Watching closely as I may get back in at these prices.
To all the people that bout CAR above 500, you have my sympathy 😔
but muh spy p00ts
Closing my QQQ call for a 65% profit.
I want to see Elon’s loss porn and fap vigorously
I know. Which given TSLA’s rise is a quasi dip. 

Plus, I’m retarded, give me a break.
No
Just don't buy things that go down, easy peasy.
You lucky bastard. People have been saying this about Tesla since it was 200 pre split. Sometimes shit just does up
#FUCK I DIDNT SELL THE TOP
I'm downgrading my portfolio to a sell this quarter.

Appreciate it
fuck i wanna paperhands my gme calls so bad
spy is fucking rippin
Is 177537755 / 654 equal to 271464.457 ?
Someone bought 500 chegg 45Ps at 2:30 yesterday for 0.2 worth 12 now
I think that is the play for next week, but I respect the game.  If it works out, fuck you you piece of shit.  Also, good luck.
I’m calling you a pussy for this pussy bet
I hope no one did a FOMO or Yolo on CAR
When GME finally falls to its real price it’s gonna result in the largest single creation of edgelords. A whole generation of high school juniors and seniors who are going to die their hair purple and join the next Occupy Wall Street group.

Unlike you retards, I can handle losses.

If Zillow doesn't absolutely crush earnings today, they are xtra big ass fuk
I just like the chart tbh, ta seems to track macro levels on GME pretty well
Is the announcement today or tomorrow? Thanks
Or maybe that it gained 50% in a few weeks
I want to know how much 170c we’re yesterday

Lmao Zillow with the swan dive! 10/10! 😂
If you look at the chart each successive ape pump is about 50% smaller than the previous one cuz these broke bois are all out government stimmies. Following that logic, we are very near the top of this GME pump. Maybe one more little push and then back to 160.
Probably this is a nice dip for my chip
The second half is for tomorrow obviously
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Tomorrow
Yep. I bought 190P for $12 when it was at $360, sold for $14.50 at $400. Now it’s at $350 trading at about 10 bucks.

Been offline. What the fuck happened to CAR?
Pricing in is money over time..

Were you not here for September?
Or a thank you
In the what? I just watch price action. I noticed GME was going up and watched it all day yesterday while I was working. It used R3 as SUPPORT which is absolutely insane from a price action POV. Today it blasted through VWAP through the pivot and is working its way to R1 ($212). R2 is $225, which is where it peaked during its last run in August. If it holds R2, I genuinely don't know where it will go next. $250? $300? $400?
Ok now do OCGN next
Crayon eaters have done worse. You’re fine
Ok but what actually caused the CAR spike? Just listened back to the entire earnings call. Would the announcement of a potential share buyback over the next few years cause a 200% run up?
Awwww craaap!!

I'm a bull and love making money when everyone else makes money. But jesus fuck, if you didn't short CAR at the top, and you aren't short now, you are a fucking retard. I want to short more but I also don't want to fuck up my percentage gains because I got short fills at $500 when the stock halted at $480.

Want to know how I know retail is retarded? The STOCK HALTED FOR 5 MINUTES. I placed a limit order to sell short at $500, which is $20 MORE than the ask price, and it was STILL FUCKING FILLED as soon as the halt was over.

Someone had a market order for over $500 and waited out the fucking halt at $480 on its way down. 

Thank you, brave retard. Thank you so much for the gains today.
Could you even make money on puts for  CAR rn? Lol

Not at all. If a stock loses 50% then it needs 100% gains to make up for it.

But then... when it gains 100% it only needs 50% losses to make up for it.

The system (math) is rigged against us!

I don't get the chegg dip. Not holding but I and people I know still use chegg. Course material is incredibly homogeneous now and chegg still has the best answers.

I was literally part of a team that interviewed students accused of cheating with CHEGG, should have known to buy puts

GME still has a gap to fill @ 300
Depends. If he’s not as fake and bullish as normal probably not. But what will make it fall hard is the interest rate increase
no, but he haxd your profile and made you say stupid shit for extreme ape flair.
Boy I wish every ticker that tanked 6% in PM immediately ran up to its previous close and let you get out.
Get your soothers out peeps.

So, can we ape strength chegg pls my bags are heavy
Right.
I have bought high and sold low all morning.. Just cut my account by 33% in one day. Is anyone thinking TSLA still has legs or do I need to find an exit?
lmao CARS had a random spike, most likely from retards typing the wrong ticker
lol…riiiight
Delete your account
SPY approaching 462 is literally bananas
So Tesla is gonna slow bleed until close today huh? Hello darkness my old friend
Don't let this young account fool you. When gme bullshit started happening it was cool to buy, but it was literally all they would post about. All other information would get buried. People would be like "I yoloed my child support money, I'm just a dumb single dad from Michigan and you guys made me a millionaire!!! Apes stronk!!!!1!!"
Did that Tesla Bear cuck got me banned?
ok see you tomorrow boss

I will take the thought for the deed, sir
Big wall at $16 for OCGN
Whats it called when you buy an expensive call for 1$? I remember someone bought a gme call for 1$ when halts are happening. And big funds do it as well but never expect someone to sell to them

Not fair
What the hell’s going on out here?
Do 500C 12/31, 530C 1/21/2022
That's not a naked short. That's shorting using margin.

Naked shorting is when your broker is allowing you to sell shares that don't exist.
Put CAR, put em in the grave
I’m thinking that’s gonna be a reality, too.

are we going back to GME?
The right time to load tesla fds is now
No
🤡
I bought CAR at 520$ what should I do now?🤡🤡
No I came here during the covid crash and original Tesla run I don't fuck with that shitty stock or any of you noobs.
These Tesla bags are getting super heavy.
There ain't no good stocks

There ain't no bad stocks

There's only you and me

And we just lose money
When this meme market crashes 80% like 2000 millennials who went all in are gonna be fucked for life… and probably still act like victims
Right? Maybe 2 ppl in the whole sub made that trade lol
Holy shit this dudes post history is sad, dedicated his life to a dead meme stock
When is RIOT gonna be a trendy stock again
BNGO 7$ EOD
Got in at $8 OCGN, just sold near $16 for decent profit, will rebuy it near $15 today for another run
GME looks like it’s getting a leg up. Gonna grab a couple 11/26 230s here.
Losing it all on a rental car stock seems like the way to go

These 11/12 470c about to print. Here’s to absurd out of the money plays!
It's amazing how a 50% loss can knock out a 100% gain. CHGG
Ocu degenerates unite
Stop dicking around Chegg. I bought the dip now you go up
Is there anyone here who bought GME at $420, 🥭 at $175, and CAR at $500? Show yourself.
 Can’t stop, won’t stop, overstock
That is my question. It is ridiculous. Fidelity alone has over 2.5m shares available to short. It isn't hard to borrow. It is a nominal rate to borrow the shit right now.
Probably like 0.001% of this sub have the ability to short actual shares. And for good reason.

CAR just bounced off the 20 sma. Prepare for jump like in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off

Look guys it’s me if tsla doesn’t hit 1230 by tomorrow I’m banned. Always I still have my tsla calls and holding strong I will not be shaken out. I stand for tsla and I stand for calls! Remember you need big big balls in this market
Oh I made 300k with only 1000 dollars on CAR every fake one right here
Yeah I'm up 90% from when I bought earlier this year. Really wish I had bought more though haha
hi guys me again, afrm double hulk dildo please I'm just trying to get out of these calls thanks
Ah yes, great point
You mean Ivermectin?
CAR has a days to cover of 3.6!!! WTF?!?! 
I'll buy a couple shares at $390. What the hell? Let's gamble. Won't kill me lol
Invest in America’s future. Buy CHGG
Stocks green but portfolio red. Balance is restored.
Sounds like a great plan.

!remind me 2 months

Short 2 million, 50% gain. Easy play. Step 1 be millionaire. Step two be more millionaire.

CAR $85 12/17 put

I feel like this is easy money by EOW
Who knows, don't care, making a killing over here.
CAR was actually trying to get legs under it after dropping
Sure did. But that gap up is gonna full sad because I still need two more weeks before I can sell for long term capital gains tax.. :(
It is a perfect entry to short this piece of shit.
If I could go back in time, I'd go see myself last week and say "Hey! Buy AVIS calls out the ass!!"

And me last week would've responded "This guy is clearly full of shit and I don't believe a word out of his lying mouth"

And if he doesn’t.. it going to keep climbing huh
The dumps get smaller and smaller too. 
It’s been coiling inside the pennant. 
It’s ready for a breakout explosion ! 
GME 420 soon!
covid did crash it, we just tripled the money supply to fix it.
Alright balls to the wall on 450p 11/8. Even JPowPow has his limits, let’s see this taper tantrum 🙏🏼🔥
get it to 250 and I'm loading the truck with puts
PUT CAR FUCA CAR
My tsla call went from +230% to +5% after i took a 20 min break lol
Love the new decorations
Took a massive dump this morning you know how it is
All their janitorial services are being done by robots.

Algos were bored
If you play Tesla you need to understand TESLA. It’s very moody and can turn on a dime. I still think it’s gonna keep pumping. Elon tweeting was just him making sure he let everybody know hertz wants 100k cars they will be paying for them. Lol!
Thank you CAR for all this green
Only max 50? Percent gain on it.

No from like an actually respectable business school. I guess basically his entire class cheated their way to 4.0's through the pandemic using $CHGG lmao
What what are these R1 and R2 levels you speak of?
CAR puts are the way
!banbet GME 190 1w
Are you in an anti-gme cult?
It's not even a bad day
Why does everyone keep focusing on CAR Puts and complaining about the IV when there are plenty of shares available to short?
um
Spy 490 calls 12/31 should print at this rate
It was the logical play last week. Now it is actually dependent on the WHO decision
He's as eccentric as a CEO can be
In 10 years people are gonna look back and think everyone invested in companies with p/s in the 100s must have actually been retarded.. Pets.com 2.0
A one month price chart for NVDA is literally just a straight line from 200 to 250.
These gme 200p are printing guys

Sorry u/appywappy im not cultist, it's one way to fight em
I’m not saying it won’t work out, it doesn’t mean it was smart.
I said short. Not put.
What's with all the fake-outs on the charts...
Boomers calling their broker on their rotary phone telling them to buy
This week is a GME week
Nope. I shorted stock. THATS true tetardation.
earnings is more than a month away retard
Anyone that bought that high is either some 16 year old buying a single share or a hedge covering a short position
It's a religion and I'm it's arch deacon
why are they too obvious
Nah, it went up on tsla being tsla. It had nothing to do with hertz.
AMZN....your going the opposite way again
[deleted]
tesla pump so i can sell my calls
Yeah my bad dumb question
top of class at SNU i hear
You think it has anything to do with the stock issuing? Probably not right? Please buy puts. It'll be hilarious
Do I double down on SPY puts or nah?
Fuck this I’m taking the rest of the week off
Really wish I hadn’t bitched out on LCID puts the other day.
Maybe they can show their stock certificate the next time they rent for $5 off or something??
This is the way, at this rate the S&amp;P500 might be ideal for you so you can secure you your future or a trading bot if you still want to trade.
no sell the option
How does chgg lose half its value in a day talk about an overreaction
Whoever shorted CAR at the high, good job.
YFW couldve 7x'd in like 10ish minutes with that CAR 260put

very very far
Story time:

I applied to Tesla (Palo Alto office) a week ago and referred by a friend who is high up there. They got back to me this morning telling me there are no jobs. That is all.
A lot of people ask me about Michael Burry’s swivel eye. One eye on the streets, one eye on the TSLA chart.
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

So uh does NVDA only go up?
Tesla: are you buying the dip or buying puts?
i dunno whats happening but whatever it is, its apparently great for my hertz
So should I exercise my 100$ put on car?
The Wu tang thing?
IV would kill a put at that time I think. Unless it dives under 300…
I guess my dumbass brother-in-law who cheated his way to a business degree with a 4.0 using $CHGG graduated at just the right time.

For sure, probably
Nobody has even heard of this ticker.
The GME pumps get smaller and smaller. The earnings dump next month will be glorious.
I fucking love nvda
I watched from a far
Yeah, that would have been a fucking rush
alright warren

Money is probably flowing into CAR so a bunch of you can become long term CAR investors with your bags.
This market is a joke.. established companies mooning 100% in an hour wtf is going on seriously?
CAR puts were so cheap for a minute, was it absolutely retarded to buy them?
Bought puts on CAR!! Let’s see
Anyone sitting with CAR calls is a millionaire

12-17 400 are only 1.20 right now.
1 guy on here caught it. 300-&gt; 30k 

Shit man I had 1200$ waiting on a yolo. If only I had known. Everything paid off and the taxes covered easily.
Buying puts on CAR because it's behaving just like DWAC did.
Wait for that plug power 🔌
He's literally paid to do this.
it literally sat at $20 for 8 months then went up 100% in a week on news that has been known for all those 8 months
hopped on into OCGN see it’s the “only” logical play here..might be the first logical thing i’ve done in awhile honestly

Why don’t you post a screenshot of your .038325 shares of cumstop?
Meta Platforms sounds like a disco platform shoes.
Imagine buying CAR for 500+. You'll never get your money back on that.
After being down like 4-5% dingus
im genuinely confused by people who bought car AFTER it was up &gt;200%
Where are all my CARtards at
I’m in on some 215’s
Loll and future cars not yet factored in yet? Got it so long hold
Damn MRNA calls this morning was the play

I just got a small short @ 535. Don’t want to trade it because TDA may cut off the shorts at any minute. It’s worth about $110 IMHO but I will cover around $200 if I can today.

It's  quite pathetic, these cultists
Oh okay. Nah I don’t think it’ll be on the level of Tesla though. Not at all
It'll come and go. Ride the hype, cash out. And ignore it. I profited on it twice before and looks to be third.
Nvidia is one of those companies I'll regret for the rest of my life not getting in on. There's just no excuse for not investing.

I new of the company in 2014, I knew how good their cards where, I knew they were tapping into AI and their only real competition was Google. I severely under estimated the company.

I regret it even more than tesla cos tesla was a spec play back then but Nvidia has always been a rock solid company. I will NOT make the same mistake with Coinbase as I did with Nvidia and sure Coinbase has competition but when it comes to western regulated exchanges, Coinbase is king.
LCID dropping like there's no future for it.
Yes, its such a distraction
very technical
Latest pump and dump bro all the shills are doing it
Elon musk sign the hertz deal pls
Did I get unbanned yet? Guys if GME bounces off the R1 pivot and holds R2 I think we might see a squeeze.
Short at $463
ejaculate into his coffee
Tesla’s valuation went up $200B+ based on a $4.2B sale that may not actually happen. Lmaoooo
thanks fot the entertainment CAR that was pretty cool
Broke boy
I need Tesla to do something
If so. Shit will likely rip. A wee dip to allow a bear trap, a wee nudge higher to fuk ‘em. Market used fo punish anyone that thought they knew what was gonna happen next. Now it’s basically ATM for those that believe the hype.
No mercy…Gamestop destroys everythink
How far down is car gonna go
Useful range
WSB missed out on CAR
went all in gme 200C at 202. idk if i should sell now.
i panicked and look over and they're up like 3-4% rn for anyone curious lmao
LMFAO
Nio has been a champ these past two days!  All other EVs down today except Nio
Same. Only part of my order filled cause price action too wild tho
I hope that was a short position at $545
Wtf happened with CAR
I think if you buy them and sell them both in an actual spread its one but if you buy them individually or leg them out individually its 2

Also im getting restricted after today, lol
Can GME please just die. I want this sub to go back to normal and I hate the fractional share virgin retard club.
And that is what people keep forgetting or choosing to ignore.
Fuck my arse TSLA
Buying right now is buying at ATH almost, AND they haven’t sold a single product yet. There are better plays
[deleted]
Yeah I was exaggerating, but people really do talk about it like it's the next tesla.
So are banks happy about the upcoming announcement or
Why?
Car will close around 200 lol
CAR bags starting to be handed out
Ok. I am not a gme cultist. Just saw option for weeklies this morning and went balls deep. I called it out for the bros
You wouldn't know your short was naked unless you were somehow privy to data that you're not privy to.

Technical analysis suggest CAR has a critical resistance level somewhere between $450 and $200.

From when i bought a put to when it was completed it went from 480 to 380 omgg fucking slow robinhood lol
So needy, go back to your cult subs
Good analysis my dude
Any way to play the short? See it dropping right now, think it will pump back up?
Bought at 529, sold at 420.

Not as fun as buying at 420 and selling at 488.

OH WELL!
Can someone tell me if buying the same option at two different prices, and selling both at the same time in one day counts as two day trades or one?
rip CAR $500+ bagholders
Its not too late to jump aboard the rocket u noob
!banbet CAR 300 1w
I have a similar position. Are you holding? I cant tell what this thing wants to do
If any of you want to buy puts on spy or qqq, reconsider and take a look at XLC. Looks much weaker and you have a smaller chance of getting clapped
Dude. What the fuck do you expect after this crazy rip. I’m sure it’ll bounce around for better or worse, and I know this is a lot to ask of you, but don’t be an idiot
Dump the cult
Seriously, geez.  Actually timed it well tho, for once.

Can’t wait to dump these GME calls I love making money but I hate having this greasy annoying virgin ticker in my portfolio
This isn't where I parked my car....
AMC and GME Fulling up. ?
Fully convinced their earnings will once again be shit.

They said a month ago they hit a “measure of profitability” and the market ran with that misleading headline. Then they tagged onto the  hertz Tesla “deal” and it did nothing for them. 

This company is a turd and isn’t long for this world
Prices are insane
i just read an article on yahoo news basically stating the lack of automobile production will be the cause of the next crash. how much of that is accurate
🐷🤡🙋‍♂️

I’d like to take this time to congratulate all of the new Avis long term investors.
Car falling like a rock
It's flying to 400 eoy
Gme!!
And thus ends the 3 hours of CAR mania. Onto the next.
Nop
If people listened to you they wouldnt have gotten CAR scammer
If you aren't shorting this, you are retarded.  
I just made another market order and filled  at like $415 and it continues to come back down.
Don't make it personal. Its about money nothing else.

Stop wasting your time convincing GME apes to jump ship. Not gonna happen.
Dont be a noob gme is the only play this is financial advice
Downvote the GME bs. No more please
Everything rally 

Expect amzn
The stock is kinda ripping though.  I'm up 100% from calls bought less than an hour ago .

$$$ is all that matters
I'm not even an ape, but I said upon retesting the breakout zone of $190-$192 it's time to buy calls on GME. You're welcome.
GME heating up…
WTF is going on with the FB chart

Okay covered my $CAR short position. Easy 2.5k. Will go back in at $525+
Wtf happening with $CAR?
If you got into CAR you would be done by done, the cult keeps you blind
Because you got in before earnings. Moron.
I sold out this morning. It’s been one of my better stocks. Sold too early as usual
Since when is 3% flying? You guys have really lowered your standards.
Looking at CHGG earnings results i cand see anything to warrant such a violent drop.
Yes-
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
It's a religion now homie
I bought at the low so I'm up 20% already
👆 Thanks, that’s a relief
Sell it to some smooth brain who will get it crushed when the IV drops.
Friendship with TSLA ended.

CAR is my new friend.
AMZN raping fuckkkk
So glad I got out at just an 8% loss
 Edit: Should say this was when it was in the $11 range
This market is super healthy am I right
Just gonna dump and leave wsb holding bags.

I wonder which hedge fund got fucked shorting CAR this time?
CAR with an RKO outta nowhere
It’s a good train 🚂
I doubt it gets approved.
that's because you can't see live options pricing during a halt and this thing has been perma-halted for the last hour.

if $CAR rockets like this on ER, I want to see SDC go to $30 after next Monday ER.

CAR is more up. The cult keeps you missing things
According to Etrade it's not a "trade-through" if you were looking at the wrong prices (the ones on their charts).  If you are using them be warned they will fuck you

I wonder if buying SPY calls right now would be retarded. I feel like it’s been awhile since we had a day that didn’t end up being a bullshit theta day, and we might just end up bouncing up and down from here but not getting much higher than we are now.
Sad to see people still clinging onto pump and dumps from 6 months ago

The stock market goes through boom bust cycles in roughy 10 year intervals. We had a bust in March 2020 therefore we will go boom boom until 2030. Imagine becoming a ber at the beginning of a bul market 🤡

Do not touch. Best case scenario is you shockingly double your money and sell in time to actually take those profits. Worse case scenario is you lose 70+%. The second scenario is far more likely.

WTF is the point of opening it up if they're just halting it every 2 seconds smdh
I’ve literally gone full retard buying tesla lottos over and over again today. I’m fucking copping the 1500 nov 5 calls too. No chance in hell it’ll hit 1500. I dont give a FUCK if i lose it all. Im in 5k deep. MORE CALLS!!!!
But also, personally I’d take the profits and run. Maybe it goes up, but history shows it goes down. Best to be on the safe side.
OCGN 14c 11/12 up 100% today, but do I keep holding? I don’t think we’re done yet

# who bought car after a 200% run up show yourself retard
YEAH BITCH, METAVERSE
You shorted it at 420, which means you saw it shooting up, halted multiple times and were like “yeah, nows the right time”
I have so many questions. So who just flipped the switch and decided. Well I want Avis up 212%
There's no way AVIS is worth that much over, what? Rental car boom? Shits been under 100 for like 5 years lol. Gotta be shorts.
Easy, stock goes brrrrrr!
Mostly funny money til he sells.
lol wtf Car to $1,000??
GME up +15$ from that initial dip...full bull mode
It just went up 180%. Is that really a buy signal to you?
I saw the double top but I thought that was bearish. But I'm retarded so what do I know. To me the daily looks bullish but I'm noob
Lol, you're so obsessed, the next 10xer could be starting now and you wouldn't know
Short Car = free money
Exactly. DWAC pumped, it’s now dumping. It’s garbage with nothing going on. Nothing to prop it’s price except cultists.

What you mean too young? If you can trade shares you should be able to trade options? If you put 1k on call options for 15.50 you’d be looking at a hell of a lot more than 200$ gain.

My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

If it’s a software issue, why mention that it occurred between chips? Is it possible they thought they could write code around having the wrong materials for the job?

people have been wondering why Tesla hasn’t gotten whacked by the chip shortage so far, probably because they got caught using non auto grade materials like in the case for their touch screen recall.

it might be a slight factor but so far there is no real indicator that points towards that. and even if it is a factor it's rather insignificant compared to other things specifically supply chain issues and last year's unusually low prices

Earnings had a surprise.  Shorts piled in because they thought news was already priced into earnings and you'd get the typical dip after an ER. They guessed wrong. Now shorts are getting epically squeezed.
Too many pussies in this sub now that need to be banned. Anytime someone mentions a meme stock they get upvoted, unless its DWAC. Were here to make money you dumb bitches.

What would AAPL’s ATH be if it never split?
I’m sleeping outside tonight. Fuck me ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
I’m a solid 6k in calls fml
This market is stupid dumb.  When is the crash happening ?
QS is one to buy now for big returns.  It's a big takeover potential by EV producers or huge contracts with EV producers.
Um, yea to hold long term and have bigger gains in the long run? Is that suppose to be bad?
market going to take a stinky after the fed meeting tomorrow
AMC put FDs for tomorrow?

Just a warning, if they delay it again it will drop like a rock
A life of regret
Is PayPal a shit company now? Wtf happened
clov to $150 by eod
CAR is the meme stock of the rich
Holy shit. CAR 260c are up 26,000%
Zillow tanking again and earnings with shitty guidance haven’t even been released 😁
Same brother like shit is making loss porn but I want gain 😂
Maybe the car air fresheners do? 🤔
While everyone was salavating over Tesla and GME, we missed the 10xer in CAR. Doesn't pay to get too caught up in the stock.
I thought that was a contributing factor in inflation.  Am I dumb for real
I'm loading up right before market close today
This guy gets it.
Omg CAR i cant believe it. I couldve been rich.
Yeah I saw it for the first time yesterday when I was looking at the earnings calendar.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Just a gamma short squeeze. Take a look at any of the other 15 stocks that had this go on and you'll see what it CAR will look like in a week
How am I supposed to work a fucking job knowing I could one day land the perfect earnings play like CAR. I wanna see some serious gain porn
check twitter and their LinkedIn, they posted a bank integration job today

Is SPY 469.20 a thing?


Asking for a friend.
There is no put available at the current strike price...
Shit I just shorted 25 shares of $CAR at $489.90. I didn't think it would hit lmao
What does that have to do with anything? That’s corny. You wouldn’t say this to my face in person lol
Get out of chegg and into ocugen before who approval tmrw
Definitely. 45% drop is Wall Street being ridiculous as always
Market is all pump and dumps
Patience. Wait for the tendies to cook bro. Let it stay in the oven. You want it nice and crispy
[deleted]
Luckily you don’t need to worry about that
Looks like the move will be CAR puts
A hundo bagger
CAR it’s crazyyyyyy
just thinking about how misguided the public perception that money printing and stimulus is the main factor in present inflation and the people who believe that are just being taken advantage of by politicians who are either dumb themselves or consider their constituents to be dumb
I thought I was being silly saying I'd go all in on car at 360 but god damn it woulda been a good play. Don't ya hate when memes actually turn to reality
Looks like SPY calls would have been the move today
🤣

TSLA put premiums are skyrocketing
Prove it
Ded
Looking at the $CAR charts over its existence, this is the craziest moment for them. WTF. I really want to buy a put at some point but that premium is insane right now.
who actually bought car . I didn’t know about the ticker until now
Elon makes it sound like Hertz went behind his back to make a car commercial, but in reality it's a done deal.  He just needs to shut his mouth.
Cars going to outshine tesla in 1 day.... is this a real market
How is CAR up 185%? Anyone ballsy enough to buy puts?
I want a car stock. TSLA? No I said the REAL car stonk. CAR
If you’re feeling shitty about your trading moves 

$CAR 11/19 260c closed at $108 yesterday and was at a $40 low today and is now worth $25k
Ok, market up. Who waits until the day before fed tapering announcement to buy?  Who would do that?
Car outdid gme in a fucking day lol
“If you don’t drive a Lucid, are you really a N&gt;!ice guy!&lt; ?
Halted again, LETS GO AGAIN WOO!!!!!!
Ok but there’s no reason why CAR should be pumping 200% to ATH right?
If a company literally announced the cure for cancer it probably wouldnt even go up as much as $CAR has
CAR breaking all the circuits
CAR bid pegged at 400. RIP those that bought at 489. Lol
Are there any bears left or did they all long ROPE already after realizing SPY can't have red days anymore.
That’s exactly what I’ll be. I’ll receive all the downvotes while I make money in LCID while still holding TSLA lol
CNBC: In a stunning market day Avis Budget Rental Cars overtakes Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company.
im gonna need SHOP to stop being such a cunt

What the fuck is square’s problem? Go up, bitch.
You only have the following 3 miserable outcomes in the stock market:

1. I should have never bought it
2. I should have bought more
3. I should have never sold

pre-pandemic chegg was hovering around $40, now because it's not growing as much compared to during the pandemic you expect me to believe it's worse off than when it was prepandemic?


Can anyone explain this massive sell off? Or is it just algo trading triggering people's stop loss to cause a massive crash
It’s the cycle of tard it will all play out real nice like
Fuckk
$CAR lmao. This market will never make sense to me.

Absolutely batshit that we just keep humming along to ATH
GME has been dethroned by CAR. WOW
This guy just spent the rest of his wife’s boyfriend’s money on LCID
Buy CAR puts, thank me later

CAR just keeps climbing and I don’t know how or why
Doesn't matter what he bought them at, unless they were like $30 ITM they've gone to -99%

Bull trap. Fed taper announcement tomorrow and spy keeps tagging its upward trend line.
Shorts thought the earnings news was priced in.  They guessed wrong.

12/17 is enough time I think. Buy them ITM to avoid IV crush (vol SUCCC)
🌽🌽🛖🌽🌽👨‍🌾 Don’t mind me just farming free money
The fuck happened to Lucid?
Wen SOFI moon
Was trying to ride the wave up today in the morning , was working out well till it didn’t . Didn’t have time for spreads was just trying to yolo and make a quick buck lol
$FB calls are easy money. Boomers will think the metaverse is the next new thing like altcoins or nfts earlier this year
more puts than calls?
Can people not see it ALREADY went hyperbolic. Now it’s going hyperbankrupt
Analysts downgrading a stock when they see me getting calls on it. Touché
Obviously, that's what the sticker stands for. Cancer ARe fuk
Bought it 200 a piece now they're $1
It’s one dollar I’ve made worse decisions with that money

Chegg got obliterated so hard you can’t even sell puts bc there’s no available strikes out of the money lmaooooooooo
I mean it’s literally at an all time low, where else is it gonna go
sold some weekly chegg $35 puts. Will be in profit territory as long as chegg is above $32 by end of the month


what an overreaction, lower price than prepandemic

EZ money me thinks
Go buy some puts then. Tired of reading the same 4 comments
I was up 95k in ocgn and sold it at the run up a few months ago. Really wish I would have reupped after the dumb back then.
GME let’s go! 
It’s been to 350 3 different times let’s go back to 350!
I sold one. IV is cracked. You will lose if you buy puts.
I am simply asking that CAR rotates into GME
Imagine buying $260 CAR calls this morning.... because you have a feeling....
Yeah it dropped 10% in a matter of minutes. I remember clearly because I was super lucky to be holding puts at the time and I made like $10k in 5 minutes
I need them to stop dumping sometime soon - apparently the company has no value now. Who knew🤷‍♂️
Who tf are buying weekly $340 GME for $1?????
Dude we get it. No need to say the same thing 30 times in one hour
Im not selling till it hits $30. And I still think it could go to $25 this week I just aint greedy
Bruh ever since I got lucky with a $420 butterfly spread on TSLA I've been trying to catch that high again hahaha
Literally just said they planned to invest in EVs just not which ones. Very similar to the Hertz play, just more hush hush about it.
Says the ghost of the guy that single handedly lost 20 billion in two days lmfao
FFFFFFFUUUUCCCCCKKKKKKK
We can only hope

My calls are ITM this is so weird
Holy shit looks like Sofi has a bank charter
The pump is done, tesla has no hype
What did you buy em at and what’re they at now lmao
What I figured once I found that ZG news. 

I'm super long on OPEN so this is just a buy opportunity as I see it ...
I think that dip only lasted a few days.  Its pretty fucked up when the CEO basically says dont buy here and people do.
Start doing spreads so you don’t lose a shit ton of money so fast
8x CAR limit price $420.
buying CHGG call at open wasn't that great an idea. 5 months left
SDC next moon?
[deleted]
What is so good about LCID?
What the fuck did CAR do?
Grabbed SDC 5.50 calls for .08 it’s due for a meme move should get 3 bagger at 5.65
someone stop me from going all in on atvi for earnings
Put to call ratio on TSLA is climbing, watch out whoever is playing

Really need to start inversing logic and reason. Stocks tank on earnings beats. Stocks go up on taper news.
Lock in gains before you lose and become a bagholder
Excellent testicle analysis
I gave it a long hard look after the Hertz news but didn’t pull the trigger.
Got a link?  Can't seem to find it.  Def see it cratering yet again tbh, but the optimist in me really wanted to believe.  Oh well.
Up 15% today nice
What is up with Paypal?
yeah alright, they've been saying that since 2016. not even covid could truly crash it. what makes you think anything else will
Have they started delivery yet?

Congrats to those who became rich off OTM CAR options but I can't wait to see the people who buy at the top and baghold at $400
Teslas are cars.

Bagholder anonymous over here
Oh man. Woke up late. What a fking madness.
Nice to see people do butterflies in this sub. I converted my long calls to butterflies later yesterday for a credit. Just watching and doing nothing
Yes thank you Jedgies make LCID bleeeeeeed $32 puts gonna print
def holding these lcid puts through the FOMC
TSLA picking up steam again
[deleted]
So LCID gonna bounce off this support or…should i sell now and lock in gains?
In a world where a car stock is our favorite stock, we never stopped to consider the actual CAR stock.
TSM can suck a cock
looking at CAR puts, gaping bid/ask
CONGRATS!  I've never had success with puts..
Halt me harder daddy I’ve been a bad meme
Anyone know when the fed meeting starts?

Car puts. That shits going to the dumpster.
Based on spy price action rn, whatever the outcome of the fed meeting tomorrow is bullish AF
Even if Tesla survives the day it's just gonna get knocked down further in after hours
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
gme callsssss
Elon gonna solve world hunger
To the future CAR bagholders, I salute you.
damn on what
Tesla mooning today
I was looking forward to decorating my portfolio for the holidays, but they sold me way too many red lights and not enough green!
You’re loosing 14 cents per day, however, the Greeks are theoretical, I’m not sure how much it matters if you’re actually in the money.  Theta is very important when choosing an option, it basically shows your chances of being in the money, in a nutshell.  For example, theta of 90 would mean you’d basically be in the money or close upon buying an option.  Theta is actually more complicated than that though - you’ll have to look it up.  It literally shows how much money you will make as the stock price raises/goes lower (puts).
In the future, don’t trust this sub with questions like this, look everything up yourself.  Seems like you’re on the right track, at least you’re giving yourself time for a play to work out.
Halted trading
Apparently Chegg murdered someone
TSLA
How the fuck am I supposed to know CAR is literally not a car?! It’s a fucking missile
$LCID puts up bigly
TSLA will be 1300 by tomorrow. Now is the time to enter
People talking about TSLA but don’t realize they have a chance to get in on LCID while it’s early and cheap lol
CAR puts FTW 😮‍💨
And post earnings run
Can someone explain $CAR?
[deleted]
It’s all American, I like them all
Place your bets folks…. Taper tantrum tomorrow or moon?
My spy 11/12 puts and calls are both up.. No clue what to do 😂
Let’s go gme
Electric vehicle commercials are the future
Yea but there saying it's done not going to hit over 1200 . Man that target of 1220 is wat I'd like to see
Tesla is a momentum play with momentum or hype. The pump is dead
Sleepy Joe 😂
netflix disappointing af rn
If you don't want TSLA to fly, I want you to commit the die
💎🙌
It is a pandemic stock whose time has come and gone.
Did Avis hire OJ?
Uhhhh plugcels... im not feeling so well
I am retard
nvax baby what is u dooon
Who had Avis on their bingo card? I think Generac is popping tomorrow.
Anyone who says they know is lying. This stock was $10 at the bottom of covid crash. Fucking $400 nearly! Congrats anyone who is in on it, but wtf.
I could have cashed out my DIS put credit spreads for 40% profit 3 times in the last week. It just keeps floundering at 170…
another halt
give it a rest man, there's zero volume. nothing bullish about DWAC rn
Less knowledge is the new insider info...huh
I’m so glad Twitter is dying
When CAR is done, ppl will return to DWAC
Why you shilling so hard lol, we like the stock.
Well. DKNG crashed *before* earnings so that's something I guess.
Puts on Z printing right now, my first 5x options play. Gambling is fun!

They underestimated how dumb people have become over the last year and now no one wants to go to school
TA: TSLA has a carpicorn shaped dip into the waters of Virgo. Libras should remain bullish. Tauruses should expect wealth today.
It was 1206 earlier in the session already
[deleted]
Damn, did a TSLA butterfly spread and now I'm watching my balance just fluctuate in the thousands of $$ every second haha
Why? They haven’t sold a single product
Lost 22k today after being up 4k . I’m genuinely upset lol I’ll get it over it but man it sucks

This is where I admit that I was impressed with how stable prices were from 8-9pm UK time last night, I forgot we had gone back to GMT and market closed at 8.
Idk buy I’m getting in on it
Die Hard and Trading Places are the best Xmas movies
GME def breaking 208 today
For what? I'm not in either one anymore lol
It was up 1,000,000% and people decided musical bags was over
Tesla pump is dead
naw man its time is over, gotta wait till earnings
i think i'm going to start adding FB / MVRS shares to my hold forever portfolio. i was already rather bullish on the company but i think with the metaverse i am now a true believer
Tesla is just consolidating guys, give it a half hour or an hour and it’ll be ready for blast off again
Did u wake up thinking it was a great idea to buy 1250c today as well?
Feeling like a 🤡 because I sold OCGN 11/5 9.5c’s for a 4 bagger last week
Whoever posted about Zillow a few days ago..thank you!
Any thoughts on CVNA? Earnings are Thursday.
Even if you keep the Tesla pump from falling too much, it's so tired, it'll drop again AH.
Tesla 1300 calls (I’m in danger)
RKT what the hell happened lol
DONT stop The Rock TESLA .fuck all the Shills . We will pass 1200 easily  if you think we wont do it today your braindead
Loaded up on yesteryear's shitty computer companies. 

DELL and INTC were easy buys, but we'll see

&gt; LUCID is currently green.
NVDA 265 EOD pls 🙏
Is CHEGG a shit stock or overreaction?
300 baggers on CHGG 11/19 35p 😩
I don’t know.

Old people.
at least it was only shares
Is LUCID going red to green? Asking for a friend.
How can they short it if retail owns all the shares?
I did a $38 call on LCID for November 5th, thank god it was through a trading simulator and not the real thing.

What the fuck happened to LCID? I could have lost over $400...
Oh shit we about to see
Come on GME, you were made for greater things
Don't worry about TSLA, guys.

I predicted that TSLA would drop substantially today, which actually means that it will end the day up another five percent. Call me the negative oracle.
Buying ORCL every dip is free money
Hey I’m blind can someone tell me what to buy
Hurry up and vote on the kids vaccine already so DIS can get a nice pop
You're not?
I bought loads of Ford at 5$ per share at the start of the pandemic, and paper handed a few weeks ago during the Evergrande scare at around 12.60$ FML I mean, I made a profit, but I could have cashed out an extra grand by waiting just a little bit for things to get better.  
I haven't bought back in yet... still concerned about Evergrande pulling the rug big time.
I've done crack and LSD at the same time. But nothing scares me more than jumping into tesla lol
I’m pissed it can’t stay above 1200, and I know how irrational that is but I don’t care 🚀
Made two spy gains on calls. Weird morning pump going into fed days. Made money on spy puts. 


Tesla’s are all green. 


Moved down some short calls for more premium.
I bought 50 shares anticipating a bounce back. This looks like a bit of an overreaction. If it dips more I'll add another 50 so I can sell CCs on it.
Anyone got LCID?
[deleted]
Bruh fuck GME it took me 6 months to make the $6k gains I just made on Under Armour overnight. Shares are for fucking boomers.
Lmao stfu you loser bear. You’ve made like 12 identical comments this morning alone trying to spam Tesla bearshit
CAR was the real play. It's dragging HTZZ up with it.
TESLAAAAAAAA
How many green days in a row now?
That would make a great 80s Christmas movie. All the kids own GME and make it the most badass place for kids, therefore making it one of the most successful retail companies in recent years. Every stock is owned and corporate decisions are made with gaming and Pokemon card tournaments.

How come you guys didn't tell me about CAR yesterday?  This place is full of dicks
why? who the fuck eats there any more.

Alright Elon help a few bulls out and make a tweet so we can get through this 🌈 ass sell wall
Nah, I’m glad I did. SPY dumped down to where they were almost at breakeven but I would have held through that hoping for a profit, and the puts I had are already worth less than they were when I sold them. Saved me money
[deleted]
THE OC DONT STOP
HTZZ was the play? Or CAR was the play...I think CAR was the play.
Let's go OCGN! 🚀🚀🚀
VIX too low imo

But everyone knows taper is coming, we've known for 2 months+ so SPY 500 I guess.
Literally me but i gambled 150 on otm spy calls expecting to lose it and somehow spy hits green but was red opening. Literally when it comes to spy im gonna just not listen to my gut and do the inverse of what i expect to happen.
meta has the boomers data with fb, meta has the youngins data with instagram. So in the metaverse there can accurately program your crazy aunt and really hot cousin. Don't be zucked out of your fb fellas.
$OCGN UP 11% 💎🚀
WTF is going on with CAR
There's always the rush of adrenaline that comes with massive overleveraged positions that are like nothing else
[deleted]
Tesla pump is dead
well no that would be superfluous

the 1 trillion dollar coin is all that is necessary, and just make multiple if needed
Sure was a kick in the teeth from OPEN this morning.
HTZZ was actually the play lol. Could have bought at a 9% discount first thing, and now it's up about 10%.
I wish I had day trades but it's disabled till the 11th of this month.
[deleted]
Need gme to cross 210 and it’s all gravy baby
At this point you may as well just yolo spy FDs every single day
There was a moment where Friday 1200Cs were $1400.

Even if I was mentally prepared... I'm not sure I could have. But it would have been easy money apparently.
Just spent 20 minutes on r/DWAC_Stock. Spirits lifted by deep state conspiracies and short manipulation.
Up +10% on my ABCLs, GME pumping like crazy again, what a start to the week
“The DD is weak? You’re weak. I’m here from downtown. I’m here from AMC and GME. And I’m here on a mission of mercy!”
Keep the faith, Donkey Kong
high inflation=less economy activity=less money for visa
Alternatively, show us some calls
Tesla 1110 weeklies I bought at end of day yesterday at 11 opened at 18.50 sold for 17.10. About a 60 percent gain overnight.
&gt; I think you mean a big brain move, but I will answer your question.
We talk a lot about TSLA valuation but take a look at NET. $60B market cap on about $600M revenue with a slower growth rate than TSLA. Up 40% in the last month and 120% YTD. Losing money like crazy. It makes TSLA look like a value stock.
$CAR 😵 🚀 WTF?
It’s more like who will be left with measly covered call premiums when it moons lol
Man the opportunities you miss. Was talking to my buddy on sunday morning about crypto and telling him if he wanted one to throw money at to hop into loopring and was telling him how they are partnering w gamestop at all. Dumbass me saying all this knowing its gonna moon and dont throw no money it and shit legit 100%+ on me within 48hrs smh what couldve been
Sports betting, what a bunch of idiots, don't they know the odds are stacked against them? Lmao.

Take your time Lucid, I'll sell when you get to TSLA levels 😉🤡
Feels like its at the top before it drops. people gotta collect those profits.
i aint sellin. i've paperhanded at the exact wrong time enough times to know i just gotta give the plan a chance to succeed.
Post that sweet loss porn
Powell speaking today?
Florida legalization didn’t help them
Like forreal, imagine being in this fucking sub and not holding any GME as a "just in case those crazy mfrs are right"
Gme is hilarious, you retards keep pumping and then mainstream retail traders who are tired of it keep selling causing it to drop.

Invest smartly, have you heard of 🔌
Simulation is rigged, need a restart with a different seed please
imagine being a retard buying puts while qqq has been hitting new aths everyday for the past 10 days. oh wait i dont have to
It says "...a software disconnect between 2 chips..." and mentions models from 2017 on. This has nothing to do with their recent decision regarding chips and is ACTUALLY a software issue. You may have read the article, but you either went looking for the ONE mention of chips to cherrypick, or you're barely literate.
I played BP earnings, good bye money.  Why couldnt you be like CAR

Holiday season is always Gamestops best quarter.
Avis is promising to buy more EV’s.
Tesla pump so tired without the hype

Car vroom vroom 

Jk 🚀🚀🚀
Yup
Really? I swear puts didn’t really go up overnight even tho price crashed, unless you timed it miraculously
AVIS gonna hotbox the market.  $CAR 420 is really gonna happen.
The fuck is up with DKNG bruh down almost 30 bucks past month and a half off shit that didn't even happen and we still drilling.  Fuck off
Thanks for paying my mortgage this month, GME 190c.
Guys I'm starting to think buying CHGG after-hours last night was not my best move.
Please god
The market is the greatest findom of all
Go to sleep tired tesla
Inflatttttionnnnnnn is spooky
When Dis finally decides to move, it's gonna be a +5/-5% move lol
Are my CAR puts fucked ?
Come on Tesla, pump already
Why not $10T. Or $100T. 1 trillion doesn’t even seem impressive anymore
Wtf is up with this Visa selloff, down below $215 made sense after earnings and outlook despite most of it being fine but this is a near match to their March 2020 Covid dump
Every time I think Visa can’t get lower, and I say it’s time to buy calls, that fuck somehow drops lower.
Everybody selling the Nasdaq top 

Drops fast
There’s a decent bearish dd for this earnings posted recently.
you woulda thought CAR would have dropped after the halt. wrong. now back to halted. really wanna see the fundamentals behind ol betz..in the world of imagination imagine loading up on calls yesterday for no good reason wand waking up today
Kind of cool, the market is now full of retarded, so if JP Morgan say car is underevaluated in the morning, it's easy for us, retarded, to just pump this shit and then dump it and make a lot of $$$. 0 knowledge are needed. In fact, the less you got, the better!
Na I’ll take a 60 percent day overnight
I’ve been holding BNGO for a minute. Nice to see it’s not shitting the fucking bed.
Im up 40% in 3 days bc of $OCGN
No specific date yet but likely next week.
Hmm. Guess I missed it. I'm going to hold then, as I bought in before the stock split. 

Today it might fall because of the Hertz news.
When I'm wrong I'm completely wrong
Lost 98% of my portfolio twice in the last month on meme plays right after making over 1,000% both times.  Stonks just go up though so all in with my last $69 on 1DTE way OTM Spy calls
damn imagine if car had weeklies. the gamma force would be stroooong

Rumored to be next week.
I did this Friday 11.50 put and next Friday $9 put.

GME back to business 🚀🚀🚀
Bought 10 shares of Tesla 2 months ago, I’m doing pretty well on them. I’m just not sure if I should pass these on to my grandkids or sell for the safe quick gains
GME pumping hard right now!

I swear my tickers only move up when I don’t watch them. When I do they go straight down
Oh dang I was looking at the wrong ticker
Who fucking knows.

Just got out of a 1 hour coma. Can’t wait to see how my TSLA puts are printing!
I might what is the date or has it not been released
Starting to consider that TSLA may stay around 1200 and fuck both puts and calls!!!
[deleted]
LMAO
I wish I had the shares to sell TSLA calls
Have they released the IPO date yet?
Bought it at $9 a share in my moms roth, sadly it was only 1 share
Tesla might be scared of the color green for a while
they have, but they can't focus on it too much or ppl will accuse them of manipulating the market instead of doing their actual job, which is protecting the economy.

Come on GME, give it to me hard

i have heard all that before.
Buy the Dip and collect tendies. Until next year
Except for when he tweets that the stock is too high in his opinion lol
Always do the opposite of what makes sense with TSLA.

I bet that TSLA would fall to 900 dollars, but there is no way I would ever put money where my mouth is and buy puts.
lmfaoo…let me get some CAR calls for a casual 10,000k per pop

you mean other than the other 42 bear traps we have seen this year?
Anyone saving cash for Rivian IPO or am i the only retard?
Drilling up
I've finally had enough of the PTON bullshit, I'm out.  What a waste of time, was hoping to capture long term cap gains on this but instead almost all the gains are gone regardless.  Hope this is a lesson to me to not wait on long term gains with a bullshit company, grab those profits and run.
You all were so worried about Tesla, you forgot about UAA. They alway beat earnings by 300%, today it paid off.
wish i had a time machine for them car calls wow
Are bulls fucked after J Powell speaks today?
are we looking at the same aapl
CAR was $6.35 at pandemic lows
you do know that the FED is going to be talking about tapering &amp; rate hikes today and tomorrow right?
“Put that coffee down.  Coffee is for closers.”
Up 150% on them but ok, you woulda doubled your money in 10 mins
Does a bear trap catch a bear or a bull?
why isn't the Fed talking about the stock bubble. seems like it is an imminent danger to the economy at this point
Okay CAR, not playing around r u

What is up with spy today was supposed to be Red  literally by all stats now it’s basically doing the inverse
oh hey everybody theres this one weird trick. MM's hate him! please pay attention to TSLA. Please. They're gonna club a baby seal if you don't
1200 is the wall. I can't wait to see 1200-1300 price action

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: CoinBRRRRRRRase 🚀🚀🚀

TSLA just doesn’t give any fucks. 1500 By December
How does that work? Can I still get it if I was fired for calling out sick a bunch of times?

yup. im down 10% in 10 mins.

You could have had a 4 bagger. And if you bought CAR calls you'd be up 10000%

Yea, cut your losses. It’s warning season, we’re going up or at least remaining flat.
Break $1200 break $1200
Tesla back on track. Regularly scheduled 1250 eod 1350 eow back in play.
That's why you don't use stop losses.
Read up on M2 value. That money has to go somewhere.

Me
because we're in a bubble, haven't you been listening?
I completely cashed out on my entire portfolio.

The last thing I want is to fall into a bull trap.
TSLA go green so I can laugh plz
Tsla thank you for those fake pumps allowing institutions to close their positions.
No hold we crashibg
Might as well just hold on and hope for a dip at this point
Should bought UAA dawg
"I can promise you I am spiritually and emotionally and ethically and morally behind whoever wins"
Tesla is hypeless and therefor cannot pump
It’s got the best blend of everything, fake stuff, real stuff, bots, shills, moronic crap, awesome research.

That's what happens when the government prints a boat load of cash and savings account interest rares are poop. People put their money in the market or buy homes. Both the stock market and housing market are booming
It's 100% based on news that ZG is dumping properties at a loss ahead of its earnings, which is causing alarm across all ibuying. Once the dust settles though I'll be excited to open a new position in OPEN. I believe they are the future of real estate sales.

If you had bought CHGG puts 35 strike exp Nov 19 yesterday, you could have bought each for 0.02 and sold for 3 right now. A massive 14900% gain.

11,065,124....  calling the top
Last week I grabbed some 456's for Friday, then sold the 454's for same price so I lose nothing other than the potential profits. Sitting on a zero risk hedge going into fed meeting feels good.
This has to be the blow off top bull trap in everything
Have no idea. Very strange. Probably is following Zillow's agenda - to a butthole since 'market' now thinks all real estate is doomed. However last week market thought OPEN is now a winner after Zillow fuck up.
“Billionaires are greedy! We could solve every problem in the world with a small percentage of their money!“

“Ok here’s the money, only catch is you have to explain how you plan to use it”

Got more INTC $50 calls for Friday. Let's go.

Yet…
Just 8 billi. It's a single day wage for honest work.
So who bought CAR calls yesterday? Let's see your 100 bagger gain porn
My dumb ass , just bought a weekly call 🤓
Well, if TSLA announced that it has gone bankrupt, then the stock would go up another 15 percent.

Does that answer your question?
So glad I sold my Tesla puts at open sheeeshhhh lmao dodged a bullet. I hope none of you greedy pigs held your puts lmao
ever go to r / conspiracy and read that shit

Zillow is dropping too. Something's a happening with the housings
CAR calls up 8000%.

Imagine.....
There’s no way you’re successful enough for this stance to make sense
Reader, I bought more BNGO bags
So you know that deal that was announced that caused our stock to run 20-30% in the last week…well we actually haven’t signed it yet but wanted to let you know a week later.

I literally can’t get over this shit.  So fucking stupid lol
Just scalped some Tesla weekly calls
I’m cash gang but for some reason every time there is bad news the market moons so will see tmrw
TSLA thanks for these dips
In at open, out at 9:50, up 100%
Forget car you can't afford that shit, gme 210c about to change your life
Actually rentals have been hard to come by this entire year. My company sends people on travel, and we rent cars to bolster temporary summer employees, and we couldn't find enough ever. We'd just hold onto them even if we didn't need them just to make sure that we had them when we needed them.
Perhaps SpaceX
yeah say that to the call option holders
How the fuck is spy up 40% on the year
Haha I bet you read balance sheets too, snowflake bitch.

What option calls do I buy and date
Soooo spy puts now? When?
oh TSLA ur a naughty lil girl aren’t you…fuck u CAR holders btw

Why the hell is BABA down this time?

It will drop with the rest of the market eventually, then it will be a great buy.  Not right now lol
50/50 either it does or it goes up more
It's mostly algos
EOD....some in here will have to resort to sukin dik behind WEN to recoup losses.....good chance I may be one of them
$500 in UPST in March would have done the same.
Tesla cannot pump without hype
Thanks everyone. You live and you learn!
TSLA gang not done yet!
No it won't. It's a piece of shit stock that's being shitting the bed for weeks.

Can somebody explain what the fuck is happening to opendoor? $OPEN???
Elon still waiting for the UN to announce how they plan to use his 6B. Good for him for calling out their bluff, CEO’s are the future. Politicians can suck my ass.
The options prices are insane 🤯
bro good timing
You don’t think Tesla can keep pumping? Okay buy puts or stay away from it. Otherwise ride with us to big green profits!
PLUG powaaaa
Come on with this fucking NIO buy, get hedge founds covered
Suck it BRO I only use them when I’m not super confident in a position and I can’t sit and watch it the whole time okay so SUCK IT
Any CAR sympathy plays?
As far as I saw in mine, IV stayed relatively flat around 98/99%
onward and upward to 1250
AMC is only being held aloft by being tied to GME and the stock frenzy.  Aron is a moron and the company is pretty fucked with streaming having movie releases now

OCGN is testing major resistance, could go crazy if it gets through
Yeah, also I meant the one year chart. But if it goes past 15.50-.80 then good for everyone that held calls, but the $9-11 puts are stupid cheap and a good probability it will hit.
You don’t need to know shit if you buying SPY and QQQ couple months out
What is happening to $GMBL?? Getting pumped 18%
SPY pump before the fed meeting dump
wtf tsla isnt a 2 trillion market yet?!
&gt; Tesla is shit and overpriced.
why anyone on this sub is buying calls before walking into 2 days of FED meetings &amp; not sitting cash gang or SPY straddle heavier on the put side is beyond me.
Iv never seen that big a selloff than chgg tbh. literally at precovid levels while doubling revenues since then 😆
BB and SNAP just need a Lil volume to run this week ..hint hint
Damn, is Chegg gonna hit a circuit breaker lmaooo?
Lol... yeah forgot that part... FUCK YOU GUYS AND CONGRATS

Back to 1200 xD
Watch the jump after the halts
at this point the shambles might be in the bears themselves
You need a stop limit order for that. Your limit sell order will have executed close to current market price though, it means : sell if market price is equal to limit or better
Lmaoo imagine thinking tesla is dead 🤡🤡🤡🤡
TSLA pumpers are fuckin' weird
&gt; I have a gaming PC.
99% of this market is understanding Jerome and his urge to fuck your puts
Got a 200c 11/5 myself on the morning dip. Looking like mightve been a good move for us both
You're gonna lose bigly i guarantee it
Up 100% on GME calls from open, going to be 10 baggers by Friday.
So did anyone else go full retard on TSLA options today or am I the only knuckle dragger here?
Dude
What happened to TSLA this morning is why I’m out before the end of the trade day.  Took the profit yesterday and dumped 30k in this morning for more call options!    Go baby go!
Setting a limit at that level will get you filled “at that price or better.”  So if the stock is $50, you set a limit sell at $45, you’ll immediately get filled somewhere between $45 and the current price of $50 but you’ll likely get a bad fill.  What you want to be using is a stop order, which is a market order that is triggered only when the price reaches a certain level.  I.e., if you want to sell should the price go down to $45, you set a stop sell order at $45, and when $45 is hit it will market sell your shares.  You can also do a stop limit order, which creates a limit order after your stop is hit.  So $45 stop limit order with the limit also at $45, once $45 is hit it will only sell your shares for $45 or more.  Generally stop limits can be risky if the stock is in free fall because you won’t sell them as it won’t be above the limit price.  Most people just use stops if they’re using such orders at all.

Depends what kinda PC

Im redoing my basement with the profit from my sophie calls i sold last week… if i fucking held them i coulda built a new PC too
$10k worth of 260 calls on CAR would have made you an instant millionaire today.
That's ballsy, and I'm bullish as shit.  Id be surprised if we stay that high by EOW if we even break it

\#F. Go buy a bunch of 26c 11/19 PLTR after the rug pull today/tomorrow fellow Palantard. You &amp; I both know they will destroy ER on 11/9.
Thanks Obama.
So I have been trying to learn options the last 6 months but it hasn’t really paid off for me. I have realized that a little bit longer dated calls that are in the money although much more expensive to buy are the best way to improve my odds of making tendies. Anyone that would be able to answer a question about theta and delta numbers on a 459 SPY call with 11/19 exp. paid 509 a piece for them just wondering at what point theta will start eating it away + .56 delta and - .14 theta currently. Assuming it stays in the money at what point should I sell ?
And also fuck you to all the CAR holders
I guarantee you Cathie has some poor intern constantly refreshing Elon’s twitter with his finger hovering over the sell button

thanks gme. made a couple hundo jacking off in the shower
&gt;am I a dumbass and did I just sell at a lower price for no reason

Sorry but yes(did that also on my second trade). You didn't sell at at lower price, it was the same as market order but for what you wanted you need a stop order.
TSLA 1250 EOD
Cannot wait to drop off these dkng bags at some point 🗑

Next time use stop and not limit. Did your broker not give you a warning before putting the trade through?
Will it go further?
Take that stop loss shit to r/investing, pussy.

who the fk held CAR? What was your reasoning on this lol
What time is the fed meeting
Tesla down because Musk says Hertz deal hasn't been signed. 
I have wondered how Hertz could pull off a 100k car purchase along with needed in house charging infrastructure. They dont have that kind of cash, and lendors would just see it as car purchases of a mostly crappy business model with now higher operating expenses.  It's not like them being Tesla's is some kind of game changer for Hertz.

Can you imagine if the plan all along was for Hertz peeps to buy boat loads of 0dte Tesla calls, then announce the purchase that they had no plans to go through with. Just so they could make bank. That would be epic.
IV crush.
Dude to be real… I almost shit myself and was gonna sell this morning!!! But said fuck it! Held and made more than I made yesterday! Love the people who buy the dips!

Congratz to all you $CAR holders.......
Call me retarded but I am buying $BB ans $SNDL
IV dropped too. Murders the value.
Congrats to all the new CAR/Avis millionaires!
So if you were just buying deep OTM calls on Avis you’re rich as shit now.. but who tf was buying that prior to today??
CRSR is still the worst company of all time

Oh ok so opendoor is just gonna dump for no reason/no news. I see
I mean, TSLA is something like 6% of QQQ but it’s only like 1.75% of SPY. I don’t know if I would call that balls deep
Those GME 200cs hit pretty fucking quick damn
Use your fucking head bro.

Retail sentiment pushes stocks up. Doesn't mean hedge funds don't jump on board to help with the cash. 

You're basically arguing that retail sentiment doesn't matter, which is a stupid take.
Told ya to buy into ocgn last week.
Theres still time tho.
I have a feeling anything bought now on TSLA will belong to Theta gang. Swings are done.
Haha nice move anon

Is CAR halted lol?
Real question to a newbie. Usually sell shares at market price but thought I was setting a limit by pressing limit and sell at lower price. am I a dumbass and did I just sell at a lower price for no reason. Because I no longer hold any shares but I meant to do it if the price just dropped to that level.
Fuuuuugggggggg
Yes.
January $60 calls on CMPS gonna print money, heard it here first fuckers. New widespread study results being released, early indicators are it's successful and moon landing is incoming.  Be the next Peter Thiel.

NET PUTS for the hopes of it pulling a CHGG this Thursday
Way to fucking expensive and now worth it
Record revenue
all in on CAR at 360
🤞
There are people who saw Tesla at 1200 this morning and thought "yeah I should enter here."

😂
TSLAs are the best CARs imo
Wow if anyone had car calls they are fucking rich. Even the furthest strike is now 12k a contract. Why the fuck did i listen to some retard who said the option prices were to high yesterday
SKT is back baby!!
Would of been rich
CAR $420 is not a meme
It's incredible how TSLA intraday high so far matched yesterday's close to the penny

Yep retail investors are casually pushing a trillion market cap stock up….right
I am thinking dkng puts for earnings… 

What Happened: A Form 4 filing from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission states that Matthew Kalish exercised options to purchase 96,154 Draftkings shares at prices ranging from $0.63 to $3.82 per share for a total of $305,837 on October 29. They then sold their shares on the same day in the open market. They sold at prices ranging from $46.82 to $47.52 to raise a total of $4,507,798 from the stock sale.


Why else would this dude seem 4.5 million dollars worth right before earnings 🤔
god damn Elon wants to slaughter all the hidden bears today lmao
Props to who suggested CAR like last week. With monthly options I should have just bought. Look at it now
1200 is right around the corner. I feel it. Deep in my plums. Nice purplish hue.
i agree with this guy
This makes even less sense than Tesla. What is happening???? I would never in a million years think AVIS would be doing well in during a pandemic
why is CAR exploding wtf
Let the Tesla pump have a dignified death. Without the hype it is sad.
GO TSLA YOU FUCKING RETARD
Statement from Hertz, which now makes this even more interesting:

&gt;"As we announced last week, Hertz has made an initial order of 100,000 Tesla electric vehicles... Deliveries of the Teslas already have started."

Let the good times roll!

Lol SPY got just barely high enough to trigger my deep stop losses on my puts before dumping. SPY you naughty little shit

As soon as it hit $1207 sold it all!! $19000 in pocket!!! Will buy back in tomorrow 😧😎😜

that guidance was terrible though.
SPX went too high - SELL SELL SELL!!!

My cups of Black Coffee getting luke warm.
Holy fuck $GNRC dipped down to 460 in premarket (I bought more) now is soaring up to 519
I bought premarket. Then they halted it when it was up bigly and it gave it all back. Dumb.
NIO good to see you again
All this time we all thought Dr. PP was joking.... He was right about TSLA. His Math did check out.
CAR is legit squeezing 👀👀👀
Bought some cheap calls on that gme dip. Will it stick? Who knows. Not much to lose
Just when you think it’s easy…someone will shit on your parade
CAR has 20% shorts.
Does the Fed address inflation faster?  The only way to get you fools to work at Wendy’s again and back into workforce is rug pull.

What's the news for OPEN?
elon is a fucking scumbag lmao
CHGG dip easy money
Lmao same there is no way this shit is green with fomc tomorrow
GNRC with the fake dump and pump this morning
Somethings happening
back to 1200 soon remember you have to re-charge teslas
Okay back to Tesla calls I go then
Should've doubled down on my SOFI calls at early morning dip but I have enough on this.
Well then. now I feel the TSLA market cap is justified
Change my mind: the girl on the right is a lot hotter than the girl in the middle, on the left, or the turkeybird
🥭 drinks a cup every day
insider selling
TESLA fundamentals look good to me. Heard Buffet was even about to get in.
On an average how frequently do you people change socks

and stocks
Now you're getting it.

We're living in the time of BBBRRRRRR.
CHGG puts 75 baggers GODDAMN
I think Elon is just saying Hertz is buying cars like regular consumers at no discount. There is no signed deal.

I'll bet that Elon didn't even care about that Hertz thing. To him it was as irrelevant as me or you buying a Tesla.
i can fly. i'm pilot.
Fed meeting today and tomorrow gonna make markets tank? No more stimmies, ya?
Grabbed AA $46 calls for Dec 17. Undervalued AF.
I’ve been patiently waiting for couple weeks.  ATH time for Spy Poots!
Hey what happened to the earnings thread?
Next 🥭 is out! Coffee time boys!
The app still sucks so nah
Anyone catching CHGG falling knife
I love RKT the company so much.

HOWEVER.  I really do not think now is the time to go long on housing.  With CB's around the world beginning to hike rates there's going to be way better entry points IMO.
Guys , Coinbase is exploding and it will literally get to the moon !!!
Get ready for that year old model 3 to go up in price 10k. They’ve been buying pre-owned cars at auction for 6 months and they and Avis are the reason pre-owned cars are so expensive right now. 

They’re paying thousands above original MSRP for cars that are up to 2 years old.
Let it RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP!
No
this is what happens when there is shrinking supply and increasing demand
Where the bloodbath

I merely see ath and rotation
Lol TSLA runs over 20% in a week and no one says anything about how they haven’t actually signed the deal until now.  Fuck this game 🤣

$1m TSLA short guy - how you doin?
wtf is pumping up spy? did jpow announce another rate cut?
V and MA pissing me off so much
No, like look at the 5 year chart. It doesn’t go above 15.50, it think it went 15.80 once and then it has a massive crash back to like $7. It’s happened every time for 5 years, why change now?
The market is back on super easy mode

\+2.5% tomorrow when J Pow is pathologically dovish
Sir... This is a Wendy's..? Or is it 😮
Sometimes I think this is the most retarded place on reddit, then you pop over to r/shortsqueeze
Take gains
Need rkt to rocket, and gme
I'll borrow it off you for $2.50
This might be the biggest bull trap of the year for spy.

If not, I will take a break from market for a while.
GME gonna recover here. Good weeklies.
TSLA needed nappies today. Too much Naruto running and tendies.

Back in 2009 I bought 100 shares of CAR for $0.70 a share in my 401k plan. Thank you for the sweet sweet gains……I’m holding till I retire 😎🚀💎

Edit:  I sold 25 shares a while back to buy something. Still kicking myself for that.
Dumped half of my spy calls this morning, free rolling 465C the rest of the week
it has retard strength so it wouldn't surprise me

Elon lies about Hertz contract. TSLA still rallies. LMAOOOOO
I’m at work right now and of course have to deal with these fucking tsla calls. don’t know what to do.

Dont be the Last one selling tesla 😄 Ty to all the people bought Last weeks i Love you i can study now again Ty so mutch ❤️
Spy 500 by January ?
HERTZ baby.  These warrants are printing
they trying to hold a zuck down
**Elon**: We dont have a signed deal with Hertz

**Hertz**: Deliveries have already started. We are seeing strong demand.

**Conclusion**: Hertz must be buying used Teslas.
AMD 11/05 130C today is the day
Lol, nope, glad about it. But don’t feel confident in any other trade I can make right now for it to continue.

ZIM
Yup, going to wait but watching closely. I’m ready to be burned again.
Is there a reason for its behavior? Aren’t calls in order?
If you saw how much they’re spending at auction to buy late model used cars you’d doubt their long term viability right now. It’s ridiculous. It’s their fault that pre-owned car you want to buy is $5000-$10000 more than it was a year ago.
Yes

I demand loss porn if there's a TSLA rug pull

We’ve just completed the climb back from the September dip. We’re entering the most bullish season (nov-dec) and infrastructure bills are about to be passed. Not only that, but any “tapering” has already been priced in

Tesla won’t stop until Michael Burry personally apologizes.
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

Did you get options 🤡?
if you feel like you need to escape you can always sell into a credit spread...assuming your call profits that is

I burned a DT myself when it was hovering around 1200, felt spooked, i'm sure its going to 1300 EOD now

CHGG approaching March 20th pandemic lows
I'm planning to hold until before ER, sell, then buy back in afterwards. I've been holding a 260c 1/21/22 call and it's up 100%
also it's better to buy the puts during the 2nd session rather than at the start unless some absolute carnage going on
Market goes straight up right into tapering announcement. Absolutely incredible.
Hah, thankfully I took my own advice for once. Not right at open, but close enough that I skimmed some profit before it took off again. Counting myself lucky and never buying TSLA puts again.
This is your dip to anyone trying to get into Tesla
Right this second
Nobody. I'm just bored dumbass
People who sound like they are out of breath while they eat irritates the holy hell out of me

So I'm guessing at least some of you are gambling degens like card games.

Pokerstars for their 20 year anniversary finale celebration have a $5M guaranteed prize pool for $55 buy-in.  Pretty sure it's going to double that at least after buy-ins and your EV is going to be way positive assuming you don't keep shoving like a moron in the first 20 minutes.
CHGG down 42%.  Seems harsh.
It’s Crazy because Theta shouldn’t be this much loss

TSLA is a holding company now?
It’s fun to troll TSLA bears. Guess it went over your head.

The real move is to btd on HTZZ. Wen options chain?
Alright retards let's go on RIOT $30C 19/11
Probs for the best! That said, LCID is at a good price right now… ! Reckon it can do a 100 by this time next year. But will be a bit of a roller coaster to get there!
But but Elon tweeted
All I want is to see green beans across my screen
I think TSLA was saved by people doubling down on their calls when they woke up and saw them cheaper
Bears: tsla is over all in puts

Tsla: fuck you bears you had a 5 min sell window at open that just got gapped like your asshole
AMC earnings today or the 8th?
u fucking with me VisualMod or are u being sincere
It’s pumping. Just buy and put in a tight stop loss.
I have uvxy instead of yang 🤡
Market manipulation at it's best!
Smart to run with 100% gains.
I'm about to do the same
I mean no matter what you think of Tesla it’s a absurd at this point.
Imagine thinking TSLA ran outa retard strength like some 2 pump chump 😂
U dont attend college?
SPY RSI overbought on every timeline out to 14 days.
cmon tesla, go green!
*Shamefully raises hand*
The tesla pump without the hype is like a rocket without fuel

/u/novoivittu (1/1) made a bet that OCGN would go to 15.0 when it was 12.85 and it did, congrats gigabrain.
$4k realized gain on a TSLA call in 20 minutes time.  New record for this small pp playa.
I’m holding, huge news coming out tomorrow or the 5th I believe
I didn't buy the dip, but at least I didn't sell
TSLA LCID to the moon!
Every dip gets bought you guys should know this by now
Tesla just wrecked everyone 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
But but what about the tweet??
Looks like you were right! Damn, looks like I will need to roll my $215 puts out a few weeks
take me to the moon DADDY
just a little more and we are GREEN
Tesla run it up
It’s green you mong
He can’t keep getting away with this!
Anymore. Lmfao
never doubt Elon chan and its meme magic
Lol Tesla ber r fuk
The value of TSLA is based on feelings, that is why it doesn't make any sense.

At this rate it will be the most valuable company in the world by the end of December without ever even once making a substantial profit.
I’m trolling the bears 🤫
Visa, you're breaking my heart
Already back to being break even after being down 20k premarket lol. Thank u Elon for cheaper shares
WU's gonna get decimated in earnings, and tank to 17ish.

Tesla pump should not outlive hype. It's just sad
I hope you sold at open.
Lmaooo I’d be sick
Get green TSLA
Look at all these salty fucks that were singing that premarket bullshit lol.
That would be dope as fuck for my calls

Holy shit TSLA. Just how
Sold pretty much all my calls for a profit this morning. Not fucking around with the fed shit coming up when it's been basically a sea of green for weeks. Could be wrong but the downside is much larger than the upside imo.
GO GREEN FUCKER
I literally can’t contain my happiness with Tesla right now I’m literally so fucking hard
Lol spy can't barely even break 461 with nasdaq pumping and tsla on retard mode
should I take profits on these msft calls or let em ride today?
!banbet TSLA -5% 1w
Bruh, it's almost green
it went to 1140 or so, now its is back up at  1205ish
Wrong option

Well, my calls are ITM.
Put the tesla pump out of it misery
Fucking coworker decided to talk about absolutely nothing and made me miss the Tesla Dip. fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
don't look now lol. tsla doesn't need shit, it's pure gambling now
sold my 1300c too early smh
I’m so confused lmao
Was thinking the same thing, after the hammering it's received the last two days....
LCID 🚀
Lately I'm just taking my double in the first half hour and calling it a day
Narrator: it never went above 195 again
I grabbed 11/5 $1250 about 5 min after opening
OCGN almost half way to moving average and we are only one hour into the trading day 🔥
executed perfectly, big MM bought in cheap
I've been waiting on my Starlink preorder for months w/o update.... Once I receive it, if it works as promised I'm on board.

Guys I can’t even bear to look at my account or TSLA. How hard is it crashing? Please don’t tell me it’s down more than 10% 😩
Lmfao to dudes saying buy the dip on chegg
Spy has been green like 18 of the last 20 days, what the fuck is this shit
The dip in TSLA was bought up immediately
Every day I remain a SAVE shareholder, my pp shrinks a little bit more
Is LUCID a buy at this price
You’re the one down 40%. Don’t pretend you know wtf you’re doing.
clov and sdc holders always do the same thing, they scream how it’s finally happening, *hold!* then they all dump at open to buy the dip and fuck themselves
And… 20 minutes later, 100% realized gain.  Thanks for playin
Shrek dick on COIN
❤️ Nivvy’s dick
it's not over until Elon gets a sex change and sings
HAHAHAHAH 
YOU DESERVE THIS TESLA BEARS

YOU DESERVE THIS
What’s a good entry point for TSLA? 1500?
Depends on the volume and how motivated you are to sell.
I feel like someone asks this question every damn morning.
You folks who constantly play TSLA options must have fucking steel lined stomachs cuz I’d be having an ulcer if I had more money on the line here.
I hear it was created by some electric car space geek
Good Morning Guys! Woke up hella late. Decided to sleep in and miss that Tesla 1170 dip fuck
When Tesla turn green….
Tesla needs the hype and the hype is dead
Below midpoint
#LMFAO BEARS
Alright gme ima give you 5 minutes to get to 195 again
The way it’s going just yolo the highest Tesla call you can afford LOL. That’s why I went out to 1305 hehe
Everything rally on 🚀 FED ain't raising tomorrow don't you worry
Yep. This how she do
When Tesla becomes the biggest stock in the world later this week, that will be the peak before the crash
added another QQQ put  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Over traded and gave back gains
Nice job you fuckin retard
why are we just now doing thanksgiving it happened a month ago
welcome to a long time ago
Hertz calls
After +35% in a month?
100% on tsla calls that I bought 10mins ago
Lol they were running around this thread all night screaming chicken little. Fucking classic. Bears always bitchboys
Selling OCGN this morning was a mistake.
Tesla rocket won't take off with the hype being damaged.
If Tesla turns green….
TSLA bears never learn, lmfao!!!
Lmao hope you bought that TSLA dip
"We gotta get those algos trading faster to fuck retail more." The SEC

You'll have an easier time making money if you have conviction in the DD. but you do you.

This is probably the best trade related decision I have made in a while
He’s been doing thst
Thanks DIS, very fun…
RIP TSLA bears.
Tesla gonna go green, expect a wild push soon 🚀
SPY popped those gas station boner pills this morning
I have $600 that’s not in my longs. What do I yolo into

Actually thats part of it, but mostly this is fund managers that were underweight tesla, b/c they’re bearish idiots that cant read beyond a quarterly p/e (like op), scrambling to get at-weight positions so they dont get fired for u underperforming s&amp;p at eoy.

congratulations, you have been admitted to Phoenix University!
I’m balls deep in calls you nimwit. I said “another” opportunity you fucktard
All the tesla hype is gone so the pump is done
Buy an Tesla option, stock price goes up $15, option drops $50. Nice.
I'm already in a cult called wsb. It's about making money.
How many times is Elon gonna have to teach these old men a lesson
Yeah but most expected them to report good earnings. Chegg is invaluable for the students at home during pandemic.
Well, today sucks
merriledge is so bad man it's not even updating tsla options
lol, i cashed out dude.
not marrying any stock or position
Fed speech today right?
AHOOOYYYY
Selling all TSLA here, risk/reward not worth it. some crazy dumb apes buying this dip here. you have balls lmao
2 negatives = positive
Put your boomer biases aside and hop on Ford for tendies.

It's dropping is what it's doing
Tsla bears never learn 🥱 you deserve to be losing money
Made a quick $340 off TSLA. Profit is profit
Can we buy coffee yet?
Logic doesn’t apply to TSLA
I like how QQQ can just fly right through the roof while all my tech stocks are just like NAAAHHHHH
fook ur poots boi
No one bought overpriced puts at open , I closed my vertical put spread that I opened yesterday for 40% profit
Tesla is done, find something else.
Because it always makes me smile?
OMFGGGGG GET FUCKED BEARS
No
I like my coffee with a 🥭
Who’s gonna tell him?
I feel like spy finna have a crazy red pounding
TSLA is prob the only stock I actually have conviction on. Like no technicals but pure fundamentals. I truly believe in this man and what he does. I'm not saying I'm a simp or idol worhsiper. But out of all the shitty picks of this sub. TSLA seems like the best chance growth stock in the coming decade. Hell maybe even in the generation. Starlink, tsla, space x, solar city, hyperloop, Open AI.
Exactly. Hold like hell thru the FUD, sell the peak on these fuckwads...
Imagine having a stop loss on tesla 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Holy shit spy to the fucking MOON

Our corporate overlords are too smart for us they opened Tesla down pre market with Elon tweeting “hertz deal off the table” then they jack the price up after everyone bought puts. Can’t beat them in their own chess game.
I’m expecting it will return to yesterday’s close shortly.  Tweets don’t effect the smart money algos causing this climb.

Retards who went all in on CHGG earnings show yourselves. I know you're in here.
I’m probably buying this dip
I am up for buying puts on Zillow. But the open interest is very low, why is that? If I buy will I have enough liquidity to sell?
Imagine buying a Tesla put at open 🤡
I did invest in it but I also sold CCs for 155 which seemed way out of reach at the time.  Oh well.
TSLA about to go green again lmao
any guess on aapl today....my crystal ball is broke
EXPD shipping getting destroyed despite smashing expectations.
Imagine being so triggered by being compared to a children's cartoon character you ban it for over a billion people.
👍

Do you have an exit strategy for it?
and just like that, we're almost back to green on TSLA.
Is there any problem a well-timed TSLA call can't solve?
CEO basically said he didn’t anticipate students get this much dumber, this quickly. I’m in.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 
Elon just gave everyone another opportunity to buy calls

You idiot. Fuck your puts

Y’all thought you can stop Tesla ?
Dafuq is SPY running for?
META need to take a virtual viagra or something
Holy shit! TSLA hasn’t been this low since *checks notes* 2:45pm yesterday. 🤡
If TSLA hits green today, it's confirmation their next vehicle is a short bus
Thank you Elon for letting me buy cheap calls
It probably should but it won’t.

Just remember, it is the market that is inversing you. One cannot inverse the market.
Thanks elon! you know how healthy correction works!
The whole world is watching TSLA and back to buying TSLA calls
Slow and steady wins the race!
#fuck this market lost 5k at open and it is realized
These tesla bulls are something else man wtf

And like a Phoenix, or Michael Myers, TSLA rises again..
Well my spy poots is ruined
Imagine not buying the dip…
I'm so jealous of dudes who had money for the tsla dip. But it's okay because I'm proud of myself of not selling. Welcome to run up retards.
TSLA buy that dip baby
Tsla bears were counting thier money before open. No way the puts went up that much even with the dump. If you didn't buy totally retarded otm calla they didn't even dip below yesterday's purchase point
Really unusual action for BB
I made a whopping $25 on Tesla😂 I’m just messing with stuff on RH. I have no clue what I’m doing…. Wish I had more money to do stuff with! Wish I could have yolod a whole paycheck when I went in on Tesla. But I’ll take my small gains😂

TSLA… BTFD!
Let’s see 16,000 today!!!
TSLA CALLS AT OPEN FOR FREE MONEY, told ya
SPY is going red I can feel it in my cheeks
Significantly fewer new subscribers/enrollments
Go figure, CRSR bleeds all year posting growth and profit.  Then they announce negative EPS and they're up 6%.  haha love this market.
Can’t be that upset but I sold my NVDA calls yesterday still took a $1.2k profit but fuck

I gotta say, it seems like SPY *really* doesn't wanna return to its previous trend line and it was just pretending it did. Nothing has actually changed since the trend broke at about 450 back in like August.

Yolo on YQ......In Jan it was 25 a share. Got heavily shorted down to .60 cents. There is lil to no resistance, so i decided to yolo on call option expiring next year.  Obv. This isnt any kind of advice. This is just what someone would do with my level of retardation.

The more you downvote me without actually thinking about what I'm saying or replying to address my points, the harder you make it for your brain to work. If admitting you're wrong is painful to you, it's one of those things where you have to rip the band aid off as soon as possible because the more you refuse to admit you're wrong and the more you make yourself look stupid the more embarrassing the reality gets, and the more you have to delude yourself to avoid it, and the more you embarrass yourself, and the more you have to delude yourself to avoid it... seriously, break the cycle if you can, hit that reply button and type something other than a dumbass joke after you hit the downvote button.

100%, now imagine if Toyota or Honda are able to build EV’s at a cheaper price point than Tesla. They would dominate the lower end of the market share. The biggest problem Tesla will have is defining a strong moat. What will they be Great at? Their market share will slowly start to erode. The wealthy will stick to status symbol EV’s like Porsche and the lower class will take the cheapest option. Don’t even get me started on Tesla’s make belief Full self driving. True full self driving is a decade away from ever happening and that’s optimistic. Even if they get the tech perfected the federal litigation will be a nightmare to get through. That’s enough time for the other manufacturers to more than catch up

What do you mean the Fed isn't tapering

What do you mean the taper isn't enough to slow inflation

What do you mean rates hikes are never coming

What do you mean rate hikes wouldn't be enough to slow inflation

What do you mean stocks only go up
U guys like ELY
no one seems concerned about the FOMC meeting and a potential a curveball to taper/raise rates. Everyone's addicted to easy fiscal policies and gains form this month

How can the government offer a bigger EV tax credit to only union manufactures? This does not promote innovation and healthy competition. The US auto workers that work in 'right to work' states are being unfairly discriminated against so that a few companies can benefit. I am pro union but also pro competition and I don't understand how this provision helps the US increase EV adoption.

What's retarded about it you fuckin retard?
I'm taking a mulligan.
CHGG puts were an easy 20-bagger.
With that kind of math you belong here
&gt; They ordered from GM, Ford and Tesla.
That’s 25x returns in a year
what do you mean they're coming and will be in our houses?
Didn’t they order from all car companies with no contract?
No but seems like puts would be the play. Run up has been huge. Their President sold millions in shares last week and they’re investing in India (à la Enron).
I know, I saw the tweet.  Doesn't mean they didn't actually do an order just no fixed contract in regards to price so they may change their mind on future orders.  But an order had to take place because they have them in stock.  Its just funny to see the press interpret things.
I think tsla will finish barely green
Not a great idea to short TSLA. That stock defies logic and you will get burned.
There’s a lot of crying going on this morning

INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced an additional purchase by the U.S. government for bamlanivimab with etesevimab for administration together. This neutralizing antibody therapy is authorized for emergency use for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 or for post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in certain individuals. As part of the agreement, Lilly will supply 614,000 doses of bamlanivimab with etesevimab no later than January 31, 2022 for a total of $1.29 billion. A minimum of 400,000 doses will be supplied no later than December 31, 2021.

it ran 50% in like two days my guy
#RETARDS ASSEMBLE!!!! 🔋📈🚀
No I'm not. I'm also thinking about how they are already getting out-competed by Ford and VW and how these future predictions are outlandish and based on nothing.
Every downvote is one retard who shouldn't have been in this subreddit who I annoyed for being on this subreddit.

When the percentages on this subreddit have good people in the dominant position I make the good posts to build up a karma stockpile and then when you shitheads clog the place up I can afford to tank downvotes all day posting shit that makes you uncomfortable. 

The FBI killed Martin Luther King, I'm smarter than Elon Musk and so are a lot of the people I know, penny stocks start under $1 not $5, and only retards think the Fed is gonna stomp the brakes on inflation. SPY WILL CRASH UP. And if you pay federal taxes in the US where it's totally optional and the money goes to war, you're a toxic retard. 

Get at me, losers
That's a private company but thanks :)

*TSLA sells 220K cars per year*  
*All other car makers sell over 70 million cars per year*  
*The market value of TSLA is higher every other car company in the world COMBINED*

Nope. Sell at open and get rid of that bag you idiot it went up 400 billion in a month. The bubble has popped(for now)
Imagine 9:31 EST @elonmusk: just signed Hertz contract glad I let everyone know so we can all celebrate today

I can dream ok?
Everybody I would like to announce that I have made a deal and plan to purchase 250,000 Teslas so that I can place crash test dummies into them and let them loose on the road for personal amusement. 

This deal will be very expensive I assure you and so now if you could kindly resume buying TSLA that would be wonderful 😎
No nut November..

Ill probably lose once i see this loss porn
I’ll nut so hard if this happens 💦👌🏽💰
Greed kills

That was a sleeper for sure. 10 bagger put plays are rare
Then you'll lose No Nut November.
What if the real loss porn were the friends we lost along the way
I'd honestly already take the mustang EV over a Tesla. Audi ones too. 

Tesla got out-competed almost immediately. Tesla still struggles with fit and finish, repairs/parts, etc. 

It's easier for car companies to convert to EV than it is for a tech company to make cars. Companies like Ford and VW have been building up the production and distribution of cars for generations.
Sell naked calls is the only answer
Can’t beat my 1180 that is otm now
I feel bad for all the $TSLA call holders who sell at opening. You know Elon gonna fuvk with us and drop some tweet making Tesla jump 100 pts midday. Billionaires love fucking with us.

nice to have it here instead of going to earnings whisper
Yeah, I don’t understand why the market doesn’t care about tapering. In years past it sure cared. I don’t understand this.

You dumb bot im in at $42!!
You’re in the clear king 😎

Yeah thats pretty much the plan for me at least. Usually it only takes me like 2-3 days with the nicotine gun then i can do cold turkey.

if you nut before market open it will save your options
get a 10 bagger
Did Hertz order from LCID too?
This can’t keep going on forever. Eventually it’s going to come to the point where people realize Tesla will never reach the sales estimates it’s current valuation is based on because by then Tesla will have a plethora of competitors. Ford is just one example. All major car manufacturers will have multiple lines of EV vehicles by the end of the decade guaranteed.
Who wants to dip their balls in someone's SBUX and buy some puts?

Well, live it up for a week, then quit again.  I like the ice idea, make your roommate quit too.
Glad my TSLA calls are 2 weeks out. Probably white knuckle them through today and then back to smooth sailing when we are green by close.
Fucking LCID..buying yesterday was a mistake
Sure.  Ita stock that actually makes money and is undervalued.  So no loss porn or memes for this

Reading is great. Just the other day I read that penny stocks are stocks that typically trade for under $5 per share ! Knowledge is power thank you.
Did anything important happen overnight?
Cash from investors I’m assuming, as their sales are non existent and they don’t have an actual functioning product. The fact that investors haven’t pulled out their capital showcases the kind of irrational exuberance that is going on right now. Nikola is just one example out of the hundreds of Zombie Companies that exist rn

Ultra low volumes + stonks going up is bullish, right? Right?

Good morning y'all!
My net worth went down after reading this
Elon himself said there is no contract.
Ford sells 3 million cars a year. Market cap 71 billion.

Tesla sells 220k cars a year. Market cap 1.2 trillion.

I don't know whether to short Tesla, long Ford, or both.

Yeah but the thing is there's a fine line between retardation and genius, and it can be hard to tell. I have no position in TSLA, because I still can't decide for myself which side Elon falls on.  Sure as hell not betting against him right now, but not enough conviction to bet on him either.

Why would they go bankrupt? They have plenty of cash to run the company

PLTR going to have a massive earnings. Buckle up.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Earnings season.
Agreed. But risky this quarter. Patent sale details could be announced any day.
Yes but that was a pre existing condition
RIOT calls running into earnings sounds like a no brainer. Will probably lose money but buying some 30 strikes at open.
#Ban Bet Lost

/u/jamesy9555 (0/1) made a bet that BB would go to 13.0 when it was 11.12 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Oh yeah

All my stocks started going parabolic 1-2 weeks ago, is there any reason for this? Starting to get a little bit worried about irrational exuberance in the stock market.
With the movements we've been seeing =| there are more than a few exposed to an idiosyncratic move.
Meanwhile, Ford is up another 2% in premarket. It’s not sexy as TSLA, but my calls will still print.
It's not that the Hertz deal is fake per se. They're just buying 2 a year for 50,000 years. Assuming they can get the financing.
Calm your tits there buckaroo, not so fast.

Downvoting me doesn't make you any less poor. If you have a $1 brain the best thing you could do for your net worth is read a book. There is no investing instrument that gains value faster or more consistently when you invest into it than a remotely functioning human brain

It's fine a 2 for 1 stock split. Your position should be automatically adjusted
Looks like my FCEL EOW calls are going to print 😎🚀🚀🚀
Roughly $2500 out of $4000 which I've since tripled on these plays. CLF alone was a $1500 gain in 2 days.
yes this is working so well
This place never changes.    
Stock: rips.   

WSB: I’ll buy when it dips.   

Stock: dips.

The sad thing is that it’ll probably be back up to $1200 by market open, so it won’t matter either way.
No you won’t, don’t blaspheme like that
A billionaire with a $1 brain does not have as high of net worth as a homeless person with a $1 trillion brain 

Similarly, a billionaire with cancer does not have as high of net worth as a perfectly healthy homeless person - unless they would rather die of their cancer than give up their money, in which case maybe their money does actually have a higher cash value to them than their physical health. 

Point is, people forget to consider their most valuable assets in their net worth
Just looked at the CRSR chart damn that shit is funny. You guys deserve it you were so annoying last year. Learn the difference between hardware and software valuations before you post your retardation.

Is there any way investors can hold the FED and SEC accountable for the damage they're doing? This TSLA thing is fraud.
  
There's no actual deal (contract) in place

And there's just no accountability.

I’m sure he’s doing quite fine.
Whatever premium you’re able to sell to close at, that is the money you get back. So if your call cost you 1.66, if you sell to close for 1.66 you will make no profit but get all your money back.
you gotta give

Haha, TSLA is going to probably be green at open.  Look at those buy orders coming in.  Won't even be much of a dip to buy.

The valuation isn’t a function of his deft handling of markets, stakeholders, and CEO comportment.

That’s a function of the quality of the product and him taking a first principles/software approach to vertically integrating the entire manufacturing stack and simultaneously revolutionizing auto manufacturing.

Don’t mistake me for an Elon hater: the guy is Tesla’s (the actual guy) innovation crossed with Edison’s charisma/bravado. He’s a fucking tactical maven when it comes to seeking out and crushing **the hardest** problems to solve.

But he is a chatty patty COO/CTO masquerading as a CEO because he sunk his personal fortune into this endeavor. He sucks at playing the capital markets game that comes with being the leader of a publicly traded company. 

He can be once in a generation great, yet also have weaknesses/flaws as crazy as that may seem to Stans.

Edit: furthermore, add back the dips from the Funding Secured, stock too high, SEC fine, etc., adjusted for splits, and tell me where the stock could be now. And that won’t account for rating agency upgrades and better/sooner debt/capital market access.

I hope so, cause cheaper puts for when it goes to 15

Check my comments dawg I've got some plays coming up that may make you more money than buying that dumpster fire atm.
Does it ever make sense to average down on a stock that you went in on as a very high risk long term bet? It's a very insignificant amount of money to me but am down 40% on it and wondering if I should average down, I plan on holding for at least 3-5yrs. Before I get bagholding comments, yeah sure whatever i'm bagholding but I knew the risks going into it and was a complete gamble and the longterm gains(if it goes right) far out weigh the risks. It's casino money to me and am willing to put more on the table.

Remember folks it wasn’t just a Tesla hertz deal. Carvana and Uber inserted their dumbasses into this nonsense as well.
Dude the amount of bears trying to fud tsla today is hilarious. Shits gonna be green by 9:45.
Top notch hair Eric Schmidt
An SEC investigation into market manipulation is good for Tesla, actually.
Thanks for the explanation! recommend any good times? It’s currently at 49.70 I believe but I figured if I hold it until Friday I should make a decent profit. Also robinhood makes me close my options at 3pm on expiry date
So ASTR is kind of a turd stock but if their next rocket actually flies and doesnt blow up it could easily double the stock. I've got some $15 and 17.5 monthlies on it hoping for that sweet jump. Not a big bet but about $500 on it hoping for a 4 bagger if it pans out.
The feeling is "I better take profits before this drops back to a somewhat reasonable level."
Yea it was mine too. I bought at 20 and sold at 200, post split.. so like 5000% gain? Anyway this shit is in a bubble so be careful. It sounds like you only have like 50k so it’ll just be a small lesson for you
lol, I have DELL Dec calls, so figured I'd explain a bit. Don't even know how those options are going to be adjusted yet.
Don't even need to know the context to agree with that.

I interpreted his tweet as "regardless of hertz buys we are a strong company and we are selling them 100k with no deductions" which for me is a huge win.
I slept on ocugen so hard. On Friday I didn’t buy and sat staring at my laptop thinking “I am going to regret this come monday”
TSLA is going to snort a line of addy at open. Takes about 30-45 mins to kick in
How do you buy Rivian early?  Is there an app?
Is JPOW going to play a reverse UNO card like the old man tho?
Might be a pump and dump scheme devised by Hertz suits.

Elon always says that. Nobody takes him serious
And Amazon owns 20% of Rivian also.   All good news. Amazon sells Rivian online, Ford sells Rivian in show rooms or show rooms become distruption centers, etc... all positives for Ford, Rivian and Amazon.
Yea when you’re buying OTM calls a retreat in share price overnight isn’t good.
Might just go cash gang today

DELL announces 0.4406 for 1 shares split
When will you guys learn ? comparing market cap with GM and F is the dumbest bearish DD on TSLA I have seen and its been recycled since years.

You said it yourself "they can't actually produce", they can't even match the demand for Tesla cars and the Hertz deal is a nothing burger to them. Institution were actually buying on Berlin Gigafactory being soon finished that's what driving the price, more production = more sales.

They don't have a demand problem
No is not
You are forgetting that the main feeling, even ftom Elon is that this has run too far!
No big deal. CCP can pay this all off if it gets bad.

So is it insider trading if a ceo has a potential huge sale(like the hertz and tesla deal), releases info publicly, at the second buys calls, and then who cares if the deal actually goes through because you just made a shit ton on basically insider trading?
According to the article Tsla said on the 29th that 99+% of vehicles were fixed with a patch, requiring no further action. 17 vehicles remain affected...
The autism is real... VMware spun out. No change in value here.

And if you have calls please avoid the $ROPE, money is just an illusion anyways
I wonder how many people believe he won’t announce taper and that’s why the market isn’t down.
Dude, you might want to read some articles on DELL first. It split off from VMW, so DELL previous shares are basically splitting with 1/2 Dell and 1/2 VMW shares.
Right now it feels like when Elon gets pegged by grimes. Some people are into it

Back in my day we bought our web browsers in a store.
RIP
I challenge that. He just hates the idea of anyone getting the idea that this deal is some revelation/has any impact on the *demand* for Teslas. Rather than sit quiet and let people “like the stonk” he feels compelled to put out there that an order from a recently defunct company, run by a former competitor, doesn’t impact his business in a significant way and that this is all smoke and mirrors because he hasn’t even agreed to it, yet (control freak flex), so everyone’s jumping the proverbial shark with this price run up.

Unfortunately, he doesn’t appear to have the peripheral vision to see that the hype train surrounds Tesla getting **paid** for **free** marketing/brand awareness and the droves (pun intended) of people that will get to experience Teslas in a meaningful way knowing that any UX issues they have with the car will be Hertz’ problem and not theirs.

As stated previously: hate to see it.

Tesla's been successful because it could avoid all the rules. But now rolling back a software update is going to a recall monitored by the Feds. Every crash is going to be an incident for the Feds.
Ocugen approaching retard status 

Count it down 🚀
House can vote whenever it wants, Manchin is in the Senate.
it cracks me up because logitech has been one of the top peripheral manufacturers since home pcs have existed. They get a bad rep because they were often the brand you found at walmart or target because they made a "cheap as fuck" model, but really if you spend $100 on a keyboard from logitech its gonna be as reliable if not more than a corsair or any of the other gaming keyboards. most people's opinions of something being "high quality" or not are usually based more on falling for clever marketing tactics than any actual empirical data/personal experience using multiple versions and actually testing them themselves.

uhhhh it's almost tripled ytd
You must accept the fact that this market is fake and gay. Thinking will get you nowhere bud.
No it won’t retard
TSLA and Hertz out here straight lying to people lmao
You shut your whore mouth!
Just checked, it was 10/15
Zero raping? Or a little raping
I am so stoked
If tesla falls the whole markets gonna follow. Im skerred lads.
Time to really test your TSLA trading plan
Feel like ford puts
except probably like 20-30% of the people in the US actively invest. it doesn't change systemic issues
You can buy an island for a whole lot less than that!

tsla calls free money at open
Low key tilted? I don't speak jive sir.
Right?  I announced multiple times yesterday I was buying calls.  I at least sold the first ones and got some money
Sadly I think it might rocket at open again, completely not manipulated.

Until we start seeing Elon freaking out on Twitter  will you know the end is truly near.
BB. Is not it better to go slowly 2-4% every day and then get attention for big move
Wtf is wrong with steel - mt, clf - making crazy mobey but that shit does nothing
Whats the play today with earnings? Zillow puts?
TSLA calls all .1 that’s fucking crazy

holy shit that Exxon and FCEL partnership. FuelCell with fucking moon, why did I not buy at 7s
And because it does not work!!! There will never be TSLA  level 5.
From Elon Musk:

&gt; If any of this is based on Hertz, I’d like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet.

&gt; Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers.

&gt; Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics.
Yeah, this is probably the one that pushes me outta trading til i have real money
Yeah, because all his previous tweets and statements killed the stock all the way down to a trillion dollars in market cap. When will he learn?
You’ve got to admit, Tesla 1100 puts are so tempting right now
Hertz last week: “we are ordering 100,000 Teslas! Hell yeah!”

Hertz today: “wait this is kind of expensive”
Elon is gonna sell $ 6 billion of his shares pretending its for world hunger but actually buy an island 🏝

It was though, it was like a week ago
Look, I'm not going to comment on what TSLA fair value should be. I don't know. But your first mistake is to think that its direct comps are companies like F and GM. One of the things TSLA does is make cars. They also have industry leading battery tech, self driving. It is almost comical to compare them to F.
Tesla bagholders, its your time to sell and buy puts. Tesla gonna crash more and more 900 eow

Ever wake up low key tilted? Thats me right now. Not even sure why.
Well I woke up to Tesla drilling now my 11/5 1300 calls are done. 

Imma just go back to sleep and not open my app today.
And a buyback announced. It'll pop back up over the day.
Dum bul or 🌈🐻, it matters not, all will be lost to theta gang eventually. 

Anyway, OCGN calls at open unless you hate money
Class back to in person, people can't cheat online anymore.
They do now with hour the subs.   What bothers me more is that people can’t see through the stupidity of a tweet where he whines about taxman coming for people while he pays next to nothing percentage wise and we over here covering his tax burden.
&gt; Tesla has a deal with Hertz to rent out their cars for $8/hour. This is not bullish.
That’s odd, I was told by Tesla bulls that they have the best relationship with regulators.
Tesla won’t let me download the FSD beta because I have a low safety score ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Hope so. I’m buying more calls at open.

Nah. He like physically rolled the pineapple on a surface while pressing down on it a bit. You roll the pineapple around on the counter (or floor or whatever) while applying a bit of pressure while you’re rolling it. And the act of rolling it loosens up all of the little pineapple slices piece by piece. If you look at a pineapple, it’s made of a hundred little sections..little squares or whatever. And each piece has a little hair or whatever sticking out from it. You just pull those hairs and the peice slides right out
dont worry bagholders will sell at open
I’m about to go balls deep in December $250c’s today, those motherfuckers are going to print hard if things stay the course at this point.
If you bought WOLF shares when the dd was on the main page you're up around 55%. If you bought Calls then you're up so much I hope you're retiring next week.
OCGN should keep going up.  Just for funsies
You know how this works, right?  The price falls by the dividend amount on the ex-dividend date, there is no free lunch.
I will low key laugh if Tesla dips at open then keeps going up
my guess is he'd rather see a steady rise instead of a sharp incline and then fall.
Alright PLUG you see TSLA correcting? Take the fucking hint you nerd
fucking hell I'm jealous of whoever has Chegg puts
Me right now. I bought two and maybe I sell one at open and let the other one play out a while in case we see an actual correction? I probably get fked somehow either way
Put your entire 401k into CHGG at open. Trust me bro

Now that's the autistic WSB retard I was looking for
The biggest takeway, the Feds are so far up Tesla's ass, they can taste elon's lunch.
Yes. On the day of expiration, the value of an options contract is the share price less the strike price.

Liquidity will also dry up as you near the close on 0 dte. So, unless you plan on exercising the call, I would look to close it out prior to 3:30pm EST. Otherwise the spread can blow out and you may have difficulty closing for a good price, if you wait too long.
I see that clf is jumping off a cliff this week

Lol @ this guy.  He keeps buying "discoints" all year. I've got good news for you,   It's gonna be cheaper and cheaper for another year. A lot more discounts for you
It's just the pause between stage 2 and stage 3.
Boomers gonna hate on Elon &amp; the other tech visionaries. Heres the thing though they are giving genX/millenials/zoomers a chance to one day retire and get our slice of the American dream.

Ummm.. RKT?
TSLA has 6x the market cap of GM + Ford yet delivered 1/40 of the cars (GM = 6.8m, F 4.2m, TSLA=260k).  They announce a deal with a formerly bankrupt car rental place for 100k cars that they can't actually produce any time soon which even if they could will net them less then 500m of actual profit and their market cap went up 100+ billion.  They are so far removed from fair value that it's a joke at this point.  Congrats to all those that made a killing but eventually their ivory tower will fall and a bunch of people that are just getting in now will get destroyed.

&amp;#x200B;

Thats my bearish DD.  I have no calls, puts, or shares because Elon is a autistic mess and can swing the price by 10% with a single tweet which is too volatile for me.  If I had shares I would have sold at 1100 and then waited to reentered at a lower price point.
Bad man, bad bad man
Why does Tesla still engage in bullshit like this with hertz despite being a trillion dollar company

But why Elon kill Tesla :/
It seems like nobody is worried about tapering even though other times in the past it has caused issues.
Imagine you were living, then suddenly the police started giving you tickets for everything you did. Welcome to Tesla's world.
Yeah think of it like you want to exercise. You want at least 100% return for your premium (breakeven) to make sense to buy 100 shares at the strike price of your call

Your breakeven on the call should be 3.32
[deleted]
100k cars is a good deal, but not enough to justify a 20% increase in value. All of the moves lately are just options driven, not actual sentiment driven. Mofos wouldn’t be spending 500M on single weekly call strikes. They’d be buying shares. It’s just a hustle.

You are going to make PLTR investors cry
Tsla has been good to a lot of people. Especially their faithful holders
to drill into the earth core
I think Ford puts might be the answer.
\-.5% then finish week up 3%. Nothing matters anymore. Biden could be dying while Putin launches missiles at Hawaii and JPow would still print money to avoid a recession.
This is why I bought puts yesterday. When it was 1200 and 95% or comments in this thread were about TSLA calls… hopefully people cashed in gains yesterday
The question is at what level will the dust settle? 1150?, 1000?, 900?… everything is possible with TSLA.
Oh boy, my Pfizer calls may not be dead!
Two day meeting, but Jpow won't talk to us until tomorrow after they've made their trades.

my BP calls not looking good PM after earnings...should have sold before earnings.

Absolutely.  You can't sit on cash because of inflation, do you have to put it somewhere.  401ks and IRAs are pretty much limited to the market.
So my plays are based on a done deal on infrastructure bill. How fcked am I ?

I have a stupid question. So my intel call option is a 47.50c 11/5 it’s break even point is 49.16, does that mean on the expiry date if the stock is above 49.16 then I’ll have made all the money I spent on the premium back? Plus whatever dollar amount over 49.16?
Tesla options @ open again![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)?, don't mind if i do.
Nah if we do see bearish action the bottom of range is 448
Tesla is being forced into the recall. Even if it is just software, Feds are cracking down on them.
Lol you’re not serious? Jpow likes to make the announcement at 3am eastern on Saturday.
Elon
Ahh yes trading on emotion and impulse is the way to go in these situations
Yesterday everyone was saying Tesla 1500 over and over following the bell.  This morning after a low volume 50$ drop, suddenly it is Tesla 900.   

Bipolar much?
That’s not TSLA
If you are a licensed broker, go fuck your mother.
It DPO'd last year at $15 per share. IMO it'll keep going down until around 16 but not go lower than that, then when Eagle Tree is finally out it'll start to grow again. People like me won't buy until that forced selling pressure is done.
Pretty cool that everyone's livelihood is dependent on the whims of trading algos.
For those talking about Hertz being a shit company, it wasn't really about Hertz. It was about more access to EVs, leading to more ppl buying, leading to the obvious EV leader selling more cars. Big picture people.
Oh shit!? It’s submitted for tomorrow!? Seriously 😳 thank fuck I got calls in this bitch!
Crsr the only stock that manages to fall twice based on the same earnings report.
Wasn‘t it slready clear after they announced preliminary numbers like 2 weeks ago?
Just their ex-dividend date, they pay a fat dividend. You won’t receive it until the pay date but that’s not much longer in the future. You only need to be holding through the ex-dividend date.


I am actually big on oil and energy across the board so I’ll be holding most but that’s up to you. Either way how’s the time to get in that if it appeals to you and a bonus 6.41% dividend locked in if you have the shares come Thursday

Numerous other oil holdings I have that pay pretty good dividends too have ex-dividend dates on the 10th. These are for the 4th.
Who turned off the TSLA rocket?
Too high

What’s happening Thursday?
Watch how much that stock drops by on its ex dividend date and then reassess how much of a "deal" you're making and also why you're even fucking with dividend stocks in the first place
Down 61% from last week, don't know if cut my loses, or I dump my whole bank account in the first ticker I see posted here.
How much is all going to tank tomorrow when the FED tries to convince the world that all is fine, inflation is temporal and the tapering they are starting is a good thing that should not burst the bubble of everything??
Everythin red and no volume
Look at the technical analysis for TELL. It’s on an uptrend and they have a earnings call this Friday which most likely will be very positive due to the contracts they made with China and other countries for LNG this coming winter.
What a run it’s been on the last month- I don’t see resistance until around $12 then at $16 if it breaks out.
I plead the fifth.
TSLA will settle around 900
If only bots could understand obvious jokes.

VIAC might be one of the safest buys in the market right now.
Yeah. Because XOM is really invested in carbon capture technology now while still actively running their oil wells. 

This is nothing more than a blatant sop to activist investors who are pushing for more green energy to convince them that XOM has a future

Who cares, just buy TSLA.

Nobody cares that the company doesn't make any profit without subsidies and Elon is spreading somewhat shady business deals on Twatter.

Making this comment to say $GTLB will be $200 before you know it, following in $NET footsteps. Let’s see how long it takes.
Fuck congrats. I was so mad when I saw it ran to 150$ the next day haha. But tbf I still made 250% in a few hours on some dumb powerpoint.
True. I wouldn’t trust lists from anyone. Listen to a growth list and you might buy tsla + nvda and if you do that you’d prob end up committing  sudoku within the next year
was anyone really giving a crap about the cars Hertz was going to buy?
Chop top off, chop bottom off, shave the sides.  Bite directly into it.

If it gets past 300 resistance 400 is next likely level.  That puts them at a 25 billion marketcap which is same as signed sales for next year.  They expected more appeovals this week.  Price targets already at 300 and will be adjusted.  Easy money    every other vaccine is worth 10x more than this currently and this has best efficacy and safety data.  It also is not MRNA

&gt;CRSR net income was $1.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to net income of $36.4 million in the same period last year, or $0.40 per diluted share.

Thats gonna be a big oof from me dawg
SPY will be $540 by 1/21/2022 you heard it first here boys.

✋🐸🖕
Sounds like you want to make a banbet.
W, mine are all weeklies for the earnings play, was not thinking it would be this good of a earnings tho lol. 25 almost definitely will hit today at open
In this market that is somehow also bullish for TSLA.
Try superglue if that don’t work use Flexseal

Nope
$BATRA gang, we winning it all tonight!
All you peeps buying TSLA calls, why don't u buy SNAP calls instead lmao. SNAP to 70 next wave of covid will hit and snapchat app users will explode.
What a shit company
That shit is dead and never coming back
Until it opens green. He’s in tears watching it slowly rise in premarket.
bc no one's gonna pay them to do that lol.
Ok who bought CHEGG calls today? Show yourself!
You don’t get a fancy office to bang sloots on for going into SPY
Sounds like you’ll hold and drop at just the right time! Congrats!
Shitll happen next month
Tesla gonna be $900 lol
You could say the same thing about this entire subreddit.
If you’re not 99 firemaking what are you even doing
It’s okay Elon, I didn’t feel like making money on my calls anyways
They’re all just gambling retards like us. A few hit the jackpot.
Yeah I see it as bullish. Consumer prices for hertz, high demand for vehicles, future revenue
Me too lol
Not if UN guy actually publishes a “spending plan”....
Off the fear alone
TSLA 900
We don't filter on the word bubble at all.

I took a look at your post history and to put it gently, the recent posts are all... just... terrible.

Your older threads are much better, talking about interest rates, etc. You just need to submit the links as a link post and not as a text post. Or for discussion posts, you need to add more detail so people can actually have something to discuss.

Please read what the bot replies with and that will tell you how to get through.

Get out of here nerd
Yes
Sad thing you can’t even tell this to anyone IRL without being judged.
I’m vaxxed also.
But only cos I was forced to.

I really didn’t need it
When in doubt, print it out.

Honestly Tesla makes some shitty cars. You seen the videos? Daddy musk fanbois won’t admit it though.
Congrats. I hope it keeps running up.
NET 200 coming
Guys whenever I buy Tesla calls it should be the obvious put signal.  Ugh

Daddy's back. Don't be 🌈 and buy TSLA puts, my babies
Yeah, I would sell at open. I wonder what the guy with a million dollars or so in shorting Tesla is going to do
Gonna Buy more F.  To the moon
I follow a lot of personalities and professionals from all walks of investing, and both of these companies routinely appear on value investors' buy lists!
SPY has basically gone without a red day for 3 weeks now.
  
There's no accountability. Just buy and make money. Investing has never been easier!
TSLA Shareholders: I don’t want to sell my stock grandpa ☹️
Elon: WELL THATS TOO DAMN BAD!!!
Guys, if fund managers have consistently failed to beat the market for almost a century, why do they still exist?

Why don't they all just decide to pile in spy at the same time? Imagine the gains
$TSLA will be green by 9:45, don't get your panties wet shorts. $SPY ATHs again

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/Snowpecker (0/1) made a bet that BNTX would go to 317.03408 when it was 295.3 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
Top is in for TSLA (for now). So pour that money to AMZN for literally no reason other than I have weekly calls
Or 2oclock today
Not w/ trillion+ packages incoming, way higher than $480
Ew neither of those are value plays. Intel massive debt burden to go with declining revenue and aging intellectual property. Crsr was just completely overvalued for a hardware manufacturer.
Me Yesterday: *Why the fuck did I buy TSLA puts, I am so stupid.*

Me Today: *I AM A GODDAMN FINANCIAL WIZARD*

Barely. It was about as expected.
Do we actually know anything today or do we have to wait for FOMC press conference Wednesday?
Calls on shambles
For him to profit that amount SPY has to hit above 505..
Imagine if you bought TSLA instead
Always gotta make sure you price in Elon autistic tweets
Root financials are a fucking joke. How bad does an insurance company have to be not to make a profit haha.
Seriously spy is hitting 480 at a minimum by new year. WSB retarded af ngl

I’m good thanks though G
If you don’t buy YANG then you ain’t gay
Musk tweets at 9:29 this morning, "Oh whoops, the Hertz deal is done. It's the Enterprise deal we are still working on..."

And Tesla proceeds to go to 1800
Finally breaking even with OCGN. I'm out. This one has been a headache. The zoom out on the chart does not help.
It was low as $1130! Yeah I panicked a bit but not gonna sell. Believe or not his statement was overall bullish! I just wish he would keep his mouth shut some days lol.
This is the way. Sometimes you miss gains but other times you’re totally safe when the stock plummets. And you sleep 1000 times better.
Can we talk about $wish here?  Anybody? I need help .

If you don’t buy the dip I’m not sorry
Looking like we’re about to have another heavy Green Day
CRSR went down? No fkn way
When rates rise
You’re retarded. An order can be placed and money isn’t exchanged until goods are delivered, that’s when the contract is signed
Ya your right

Lets print 4 trillion instead
No
Godspeed you glorious retard. Make us proud!
Dun be happy soon.
I woke up and saw 1151. Thought it was 1115
OPEC bout’ to yeet that shit to 💯
What 🌈🐻 don't seem to understand is that TSLA boners upward every time Elon tweets and he tweets like 10 times a day
The soviet anthem is pure 🔥.
Bears need a stock market insurrection because they really would find out everything has been fake since March 2020
My gem cutting bot is printing tendies though.
He’s a tool
Don’t be an anti vaxer. Take the vaccine and wear mask to be safe from virus
Yup, nov/dec bullish af months
When does JPOWW fuk us?
TSLA wouldn't earn even a single nickel of profit without substantial subsidies, so don't be surprised that there are so many bears.
its mods deleting bear comments
EV needs Insurance Root and TSLA combination
&gt;implying TSLA isn't still undervalued
Y’all can buy tesla puts at open for cheap. Dont waste it
I mean good shit can happen. This guy would be rolling in it
Because if they are already producing as many cars as they can sell, the deal doesn’t mean anything.
Just imagine at 10 am hertz says they signed the deal

RE: CRSR, INTC

Value investors like to talk shit as if their way is the only way. But here are two examples of shit companies they love that just tank and tank. Value investors just look at numbers, and they fail to pay any attention to the actual business.

TSLA to 2k EOY
I love telling myself that those headline are retarded too so I can tell myself that I am not a retard and my losses aren't real until I realize them.
You’re betting on the US economy to grow 10% in two months.
Tesla too high imo
Because bears only care about the world burning
That's bullish
worse than I thought tho, even with warning
Okay, daddy.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|wink)
Seeing $TSLA bers celebrate a 4% dip after a 50%+ run in 15 days is hilarious ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

As Buffett would say, buy the fucking dip fa\*\*\*t. There's nothing new in Elon's tweet, $TSLA mooned the last time he said it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276) There's headline risk for sure with CNBC talking heads probably going to exaggerate it, but that's just noise.
Exactly. Hertz paying full price, future revenue, etc
Incorrect, it just hasn't been signed. Doesn't mean it isn't in the works.
Low volume dropped. I think its due for another run. News is really bullish
That guy who posted his tsla short the other day looking like a genius rn
A recall that amounts to about 2% of deliveries for last year for a software issue? That’s not as big a deal as you think it is.
CRSR must be having an early Black Friday sale!!!

not on their products just the stock
I love taking a morning shat. Feels like I can attack the day
How do ppl interpret that tweet by musk as bearish
Not trusting those after hour prices 😬
Joe Kernan licks ATM PIN pads.
When will you bears learn? TSLA green by open.
amzn has got me very sexually frustrated
How is SPY going to hit 500 by EOY?
Lmao you fuckin bears really doubt retard Tesla bull strength     

You’re fucked
"Hertz deal has no impact on our economics"
  
This market is so fake it's actually robbery to bears.
I’m really starting to wonder why the fuck I was going to rotate into some thing to rotate into OCGN, I could just be in OCGN the whole time. Fuck
Elon’s last tweet is the next “stock price too low imo”
Yeah, I’m aware, I’ve done this just a few times. Lol
i tried using DuckDuckGo for like a month and that was plenty enough for me to realize big tech companies' data collection can actually be very advantageous and is more consumer friendly than the public realizes

DuckDuckGo might as well be YellowPages
Me balls are tingling jimmy boy.
Hertz and tesla the two old school pandemic meme.
And guidance was bearish last quarter.

Calls or puts?
Where do you get 400 from?
Oh it's going to get worse bc it hasn't found its floor yet.
SPY green, nice
On paper yes
Creeping back up rn
3 Day Ban
TSLA on its way back up
https://ibb.co/5RCvwf3

Tell me this isn’t a bad idea

Edit: Inversing WSB autism and going balls deep
I just saw a Hertz commercial over the weekend advertising a fleet of teslas
That doesn't mean it will soar. A lot of stocks tank after earnings, even when they do well.
Hertz deal “doesn’t have any impact on our valuation / economics”. Oof. Good thing the stock rallied 25%
Hope so. Gotta buy back in low.
Imagine thinking printing another 2 trillion will somehow lower inflation 🤡🤡
come on man, there's no pattern or logic to this. its just pure retard strength

I could use a new windbreaker
Druggie has a revenue of multiple billions?
Not gonna lie my friend…. Almost sold when I woke up and saw the price at $1130 then saw the pre-market coming back up! So I’ll buy more! Buy the dip my friends and ride that fucking rocket to the mooooooon! Tesla $1300 today!
force a girl to lick it off
yeah we already knew that tho
$TSLA rug pull in coming!
He should ask his workers to take a 10-30% paycut again.
It is obvious it will 🚀🚀🚀
Grimes needed to buy groceries
Solid products, but the problem is it's all commodity stuff. I tend to look to them first for PC components, but there's tons of other options out there. Unique innovations aren't their business. That doesn't make for a great growth story.
'premarket low' you do know that premarket numbers don't mean shit right?
TSLA down by about 50B. I haven't read the international news yet, is world hunger solved?
You’re aware TA isn’t a thing right
Ok fuk off
Tsla pumps 20% on Hertz news. Then dumps 10% when Elon says there is no contract only to pump 20% again when contract is signed. That's how TSLA rolls.
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1455351085170823169?t=EwZW-ndzuj3XF02FlqpVGQ&amp;s=19
Sweet astrology bro.
Probably doesn’t want another call from the sec.
Wasn't hertz contract like 6b and tesla market cap grew by like 400b since then.
Happy to see SOFI hasn’t dropped. I bought 8 calls like a retard yesterday and idk why, but I made good money off them and just want out
Ouch
Factory outlet day
you cant get yourself to shut the fuck up about it can you.
TSLA back to levels not seen since yesterday. Once in a lifetime buying opportunity.
So apparently there is no TSLA Hertz deal… this shit ne rigged af man
Whats the pypl hype, been reading a lot of it on wsb last 2 days
This TSLA dip gonna get bought
Recall was already fak but Hertz deal falling of...

**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/a_hill22** bet **TSLA** goes from **1155.0** to **1250.0** before **2021-11-09 07:31:40.372085-04:00**
[The hertz tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1455351085170823169)
!banbet TSLA 1250 1w
I don’t get it. People are ignorant
Ya the day you switch to calls
Does anyone actually look at the technical charts for TSLA? Its laughable. The 10EMA is at 1032 and it hasn't been hit in 19 days. Usually, I expect a stock to hit the EMA in double the time. So TSLA is going to be hitting that 10EMA very soon. The 20EMA is at 948 and hasnt been hit in 26 days. TSLA is overdue for a rug pull.
Been buying calls when it’s been around the 250-255 range in anticipation. No way they don’t beat on earnings with cash app downloads up and credit card transactions being reported high by every company.
VisualMod I saw you shilling Tesla last week.

You're a bigger fanboi than anyone else on the sub, don't lie to us you silly rascal you!
Kernin is a jerk.  Talking about having his agent negotiate for money and stuff. Haha asshole.
Literally that, everyone is freaking out about it
What’s a hertz donut?
Kinda feeling like getting 85 mining was a waste since all the rune ore is just camped by bots
Let me just FOMO into TSLA at $1200 post split with a valuation of $1.2T and revenue that my local drug dealer has
Markets are fake like everything else anymore
TSLA calls probably gonna go up after this PM drop smh
As predicted, tsla down over 4% because of hertz miscommunication. Buy the dip though, it’ll be higher EOY
I lost NNN this morning
Relax, it’s a software update that’ll be sent out to the cars
Might already be priced in because they sort of gave us warning few weeks ago
Baldwin is a POS. He deserves all of the negative karma he is getting.

That film production might even put him into debt after this fiasco.
The amount of bers happiness and fuds are disappearing slowly. Is something happening?
Novavax.  Enough said.  This may hit 400 or more this week.
Great idea!

Where can I preorder a digital roadster?
Will there ever be another red day again?
Let me out he yelled for help
It’s literally a software update they’ll send to the cars without them going into a shop
And that’s bad news? Lol
CNBC and Bloomberg can't bring themselves to run the Tesla recall story
You've got time, so take a patient approach. I think it has to test 1000
Lcid might be a buy

Eat shit
There goes that nice dip on Tesla. Whoever said +1% in the comments a little bit ago is probably gonna be right.
No, tweet said hertz would be paying consumer price and that there is high demand for Tesla vehicles
BB ROCKET PLS
How the turn tables
the curse of the meme stocks
🤡
No, stop spreading misinformation
I’m not a musk fanboi but him putting the UN on notice is hilarious.
Tsla holders buying crude oil stocks.. strange times ☄☄☄
Fuuuuu
MSFT was running in there also. But yeah TSLA has been carrying it.
Exactly. Just look at what happened when it broke 850 during the last run. This may be the event that breaks the run, but it’s not headed back sub 1000 today/tomorrow or anything.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Easy 1300 and split incoming
I'm such a retard for not selling the last 3 times it hot 270. If it does hit 270 I'm selling this time
[deleted]
Lmao CRSR has had a straight downtrend since it became a meme stock
Look on the bright side though, it's only down -4.65% in premarket. 

Could be worse.
Tesla the absolute mad lad might actually retard power through this gay bear shit. Already up $48 from premarket low of $1120
Yeah that is ugly. This might really tank.

Run the Tesla recall story. Do it pusssy
why are you saying SPX when we all know its TSLA now.
Lovin' it. More conviction on the shills sulking and hissing here...
Idk, I like cooking the same amount of food with the added expense of buying all my kids and nieces and nephews gifts.
Not cancelled, but yesterday he tweeted that the deal hadn't been signed yet. Looks like he took it down.
Well he is a murderer
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
&gt; I don't care about Tesla
Yep, there's always waves of money that chases the first couple dips after the big move starts.
I bet 🥭 will make a surprising comeback this week.
Gonna buy more Under Armour with my UAA gains today bruh
Sub is way to bearish on Tesla right now. It's not done melting higher.
This is brilliant.  Market this idea!
The year is 2035, Tesla agrees to sell a limited 1k stock of roadsters on the Metaverse. Tesla stocks reaches $420,069 at market close.
So say we all.

/u/meta-cognizant (2/0) made a bet that CRSR would go to 23.27 when it was 24.5 and it did, congrats fucker.
$2trillion dumped into the economy
FCEL plz don’t fk me
Totally normal
Jesus CRSR those are some terrible QoQ earnings lmao
True ☝️ cuz TSLA green by close
Looks like my eod LCID puts are printing...for now
SQ up premarket. Choo choo to 270. Let’s get those calls printing.
What's a good way to get dog shit off a boot...
Bruh TSLA may actually open above support levels, fucking austic stock
That would be sick… Im holding a lot of calls
I hate to say I told you so but fuck it:

Eat a dick 🌈🐻
Lol if they got in literally any other day then yesterday they’ll be fine. Also most hedge funds actually buy shares and leaps not FDs
well now that CRSR news is priced in, it's only up right? right...!?  RIGHT??
[deleted]
The joys of not holding anything overnight 😌
Tsla bagholders passing the bag. It's a heavy faking bag
Who tweeted? Elon, I don’t see a tweet? Hertz cancelled??
My man! Nice same 22 and 22.5 calls I cant wait til open.
Chill dog with or without cheese n onions.....
This is the first real breather it’s had since the whole thing started. Look at every long term Tesla chart…there has always been a second or third leg up. Like every single time
Does it bother you how much news bandwidth is devoted to Alec Baldwin?
This is the type of story they'd be all over. Crickets, they've had it for over an hour.

My ass has gotten prolapsed after looking at my portfolio
$BNGO on the runup before earnings. $7 by next week!
SPX hasn't had a real red day in 14 trading sessions.

Seems to working fine for you ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Enjinious
Sure, go ahead
I knew it was gonna be a bust which is why I bought UAA calls instead
If you have any sort of RKT I suggest you take it and run as fast as you can.
just ban the bear either way
Christmas is better because you can use a couple vacation days from work and get like 2 weeks off. Also fuck turkey 🦃
anyone want to split some amzn fds with me 3500 or bust

Sad, the show survivor on cbs was my favorite show for the past 15 years, but my god that show turned into a pile of shit with this new season 😖
This week or next week 135.
congratz
Sorry to whoever payed CRSR
Get an ice cream cone to wipe yer ass with...
Yeah that's my read on the situation too.  There's so much money chasing and that will attempt to buy the dip that it could just stay up there with $50-100 swings for a fair bit of time.
Buying opportunity?
Lol CNBC and Bloomberg are teslawhipped, they can't bring themselves to run the recall story.
Time to FOMO into more Tsla?
Will that make it tank more
Maybe…just maybe…my Tesla 11/12 1275p will print. 

Debating 1.) securing profit at open 2.) seeing if it dumps as the hedgies pass the bag to retail
Think AMD breaks $130 this week?
Thinking of selling 22.50p, buying 25c, and selling 27.5c on Corsair for a spread that costs a total of $20 in premium 🤔
What’s the chances Tesla stays at this level. I need out of this put
TSLA needed to hit Dr. PP's target first :(

Good morning retards, what color crayons you eating for breakfast?
Only if bloomberg and CNBC stop being too terrified to run the recall story.
Yay! Wait, is this a good thing or....
No wonder Amsterdam is so chill, it's the OG....
Good I wouldn't want to be a criminal anyways
Yeah, its not going to go parabolic back down like the meme stocks. The end of the run will be violent swings back and forth for a couple days and then maybe a downtrend/consolidation.
Eat a banana a couple hours before spicy food. Really helps with the exit strategy.
Today might be the day for that yes, but just be patient and play it as things work.  I expect some attempt at buying this dip (i.e. massive call buying on the 1200 FD call).  Watch the volume on that call, if it tails off, then the stock can probably start to fall a lot.

Put premiums are absolutely absurd this week compared to last.

I got a nice 50% gain last week on puts, but right now premiums require a much bigger move in a shorter time to get a similar payoff.
I’ve been having the same issue.
Ban
&gt; yeah
My Tesla put is gonna live 😭😭❤️❤️❤️😭😭
This toyota NA President is a complete fucking loser
I think I’m back guys, finally unbanned let’s go
Very nearly cucked myself in yesterdays thread. Close one boys

Anyone else love making free money on spy calls when the gov further puts themselves in debt?

Then the fake debt ceiling debate comes and I buy the dip &amp; repeat.

Society is broken.
Dip then rip right guys?? Right!?

Same but I'm wondering that for the ROKU guy.  Didn't that guy have like $15 million in ITM ROKU calls at one point.
You thinking weekly puts today? I think It might drop to at least 1000 before getting support, who fucking knows with tsla though
lol CNBC and Bloomberg are afraid to run the recall story
Good. More conviction on the shills around here...

Is it wrong to be strong?
As far as TSLA goes, vertical moves like that don't usually end with bad news and a pre-market selloff.

Obviously we have to see what the action looks like, but a full on blowoff top that runs out of runway/gamma ramp to extend itself is typically more likely (i.e. reaching the point where volatility is like earnings day every day).
What’s the Tesla news
[deleted]
UAA smashed earnings! Yeaaaa buddy calls printing
&gt; The first ever stock exchange opened in Antwerp, Belgium on May 17th 1531. The world's oldest stock exchange still operating is the Amsterdam Stock Exchange (AMS) founded as a commodity and futures market for traders to trade securities such as bonds, stocks and derivatives. It was established by the Dutch East India Company (VOC).
Hmm take profit on RKT or hold through earnings?
[deleted]
Uhoh...PYPL getting some popularly. Another pullback? Don't mind if I do....
You ain’t black if you don’t buy the dip 🥴
CRSR earnings were not priced in lmao. Announced two weeks ago that they will miss earnings and the stock tanks. Then it does miss, and they tank even more
BB🍇
I’m actually going to take NNN seriously this year
Lol
Tesla holders got the rugpull
Buy F you retards. Run it up.
yes traders dont know to sell because the little newsie boy on the corner hasn't said "musk to recall automobiles" in a transatlantic accent. They don't have the internet. Everyone knows this.
[deleted]
Yo good looks!
For the TSLA otm option buyers , you about to find out gamma works both ways.
Elon, you slut
MPC made 7 billion more versus estimate. Like what.
who pumped it? Elon tweeted that day that Tesla does not have a demand problem, they have a supply problem and he wasn't sure why that news would impact stock price.
Poor Elon will lose billions and billions today 😔 We should paypal him some money.
You must be beta testing Meta VR systems lmao that some other reality shit. Zuckerberg please unplug him
Yeah but for WISH especially, that kind of option vol can presage a further 10-20% move if there's not much stock trading going on...

Just worth keeping an eye on anyhow, maybe nothing happens but still.
It hasn't started drilling because Bloomberg and CNBC haven't run the recall story yet
Tell us more about your expert opinion.

Yeah i know this. I been calling this. Elon bought puts last night. Oh gawd. If these bers know so much why the fuck they are here posting shits?

Have they sold a vehicle?
Imagine the following scenario (read till the end)

1) Tesla drills to $1000 and looks like it is about to shit the bed

2) all the bears throw their life savings on Tesla Puts

3) Elon Musk gets his cock out and announces a 50% share buyback of Tesla 

4) Tesla moons twice as hard straight to $2000 as bears capitulate one after another
Tesla green by 10 AM
If you’re backing just 1 stock over the next 3-6months, what is it?
Pfe, PYPL and mooning to the moon
Also crsr terrible earnings
They be commenting I get the notification, click on it and boom gone. Sometimes not even controversial or bad comments 🤷‍♂️
u/DeepFuckingValue what are your thoughts?
=|
Its PM. Its not prophets, just gay bears grasping anything to keep them sane.
Elon recalling WSB tendies 🥴
Keep an eye on AMC and WISH (as well as TSLA duh).

Option vols on AMC and WISH at every strike this week have been crazy.  WISH's entire move yesterday was based on call buying; stock vol was normal.

I might buy some cheap WISH calls; the $5.5/$6 calls with money I don't mind losing.  Maybe those guys will end up being right for the next week.

Everyone thinks it will drill but it’s going to be flat

u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR
They’re really fucked especially since call IV was nearly 100% on weeklies they’ll probably be down twice as much as usual.
Jpow getting ready and tesla dippin careful next 2 days bois, maybe go half balls deep instead of full on balls deep
The recall is the real news, the Hertz thing is just hilarious.
These prophets come from nowhere when things go wrong.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Good thing my TSLA calls never went through legit tried all day yesterday to buy them
How far out are you going? I'm doing the same
Ooh my 1 TSLA Put I bought yesterday could print!
I’ve been noticing that too it’s odd
i dunno, assuming that's true it would make sense for them to sell a huge amount of calls then rug pull when FOMO is at maximum. IV being low means options selling pressure is probably high.
I like the way you think. Good think I have some powder left. I loaded the fuck up on Jan SNAP $55c last week and those are printing nicely as well.
Hold GOEV through earnings? Kinda wanting to cut it this week, but maybe there'll be a bit of a run leading into earnings in two weeks.
I mean thats the big news. Hertz is small potatoes.
LOLLLL.
I’ve been calling this hertz / tesla deal a lie since it was announced..

Tesla can barely keep up with retail demand and wouldn’t sign a deal until the new factories are 100% running .

Then there was the “ we are going to rent to Uber drivers “ angle … what driver is going to pay $330 a week to rent a tesla from them . Nobody is spending $1300 a month on a 40k car .
Then it went from 100k to 150k cars .

He pumped it
I think you'll be ok, I think people are going to jump on this dip at open.  And I don't play TSLA.
[deleted]
Thats not how this partnership will work.
They are
But how do you panic sell if you lose 1% in a day?
I was thinking outloud. No one has a Spotify family plan here.
Then I better grab one at opening. Then another underneath whomever buys after me...
They also have recalls of thousands
Announcement of Herz deal? Insanely bullish.

Announcement that Herz deal is not actually a deal? Also insanely bullish.
tsla is at a stratospheric nonsensical price tho. it's not hurting like all is. it's gonna fall hard at some point.
i was really worried about the 7am liquidity rush, looks like algos still buying tsla
Really hoping my Tesla calls aren’t fucked now

I'll say it again. If you bet against TSLA, you are a domestic terrorist.
My thesis: if your ticker relies on a supply chain, chances are it's going down

(I also own FUBO/DKNG and neither really rely on supply chains so I'm a little biased)
Green open, quick reds - perhaps in the first hour, some recovery. 
I don’t think it’s a bright red day.
Despite this.

Lol fuck me. The one time I hold my tsla calls overnight instead of selling eod.
Wouldn’t be surprised to see TSLA only down 2% at open.
Why so many of you be commenting and deleting your shit before we can reply. What’s the worst that can happen? Who cares when mofo don’t even know you?
Tesla is going back down to 1000 or below (and I don’t even care about Tesla that much). The MACD is nowhere near balancing out yet and it’s already down -4%, it’s going to shit blood
I bought calls at yesterday's low. Thanks though
That guy with 35k TSLA 1200c contracts must be sweating a bit this am
It's not getting lower. Better buy now...

Not gonna lie… was tempted to sell all my calls this morning  when I saw the price at $1140 but seeing a good comeback in pre-market. So hold! Buy the dip! Ride that fucking rocket to the moon!
You can’t miss if you buy shares. But then again you won’t have a lime green Lamborghini if you buy shares. 😂

Listen boys I’ve learned this like 10 times now so just gonna start acting on it. Don’t listen to dumb news like this. Over weekend heard about aal news and was like o no I’ll sell my calls at open for small loss. Stock went up 3 percent yesterday. Just a bunch of FUD. Hold strong especially if u have 2 weeks to expiration
I just have to say this because I feel it's a sign. Something has been burrowing down in the soil against the side of my house for a year. I mean a massive deep, wide hole that could cause foundations issues. I saw it today!!! Guess what? It's f-cking hedgehog! Might be a groundhog. but pretty sure it's a hedgie. Rat poison for him!
Hold
Fuck a banbet. Double down on more calls. A reddit account getting banned don't mean shit

Today is likely going to be red, exactly what I need to load up on PLUG, QS and FCEL calls
They barely missed, but that’s not what’s driving the price anyways. They print free cash. Look at p/fcf. Main risks to this stock were debt (getting under control) and opioid litigation (starting to look good).
That's the problem with huge populations of people with access to the internet. Even the smallest groups of extremists can can seem like huge swaths of people even though they are tiny percentages of the total population.
I think they crush earnings. The cry.pto part of their business is booming. 2x more active wallets than coinbase already. Not being factored into stock price imo

Elons net worth was growing to fast that even the world hunger commies were coming after him, he really took one for the team with that last tweet.

Laughs in forward PE
More like people will FOMO into puts, then Elon will send out another tweet that will send the stock back up

People that cut their losses on calls will get burned, as will people that FOMOed into puts
If history is any indicator, TSLA will brush this off and turn green intraday
That place is a filth ridden cess pit. It’s a circle jerk of Biden worship and shitting on anything that isn’t Biden worship.
Wow they really flashing red to get all you bears excited to head to the slaughterhouse by 10AM before new ATHs

For a stock like Tesla shares are the only way…. Any option is so expensive and unless it’s a leap it’s not worth the time.
not reading that but congratulations, or sorry that happened to you
I only owe about 95K left on my house 

I'm not saying I'd be able to retire and stunt in a lambo

But, I live a super quiet lifestyle and don't particularly care for people so I'd probably sell my house, move somewhere remote, and install a massive cellular tower
If I take a shit in the Metaverse, do I have to wipe in the real world?
to be fair TSLA has recovered $28 since I was on the toilet earlier

edit: well i mean i still am (on the toilet)
$PYPL IS THE PLAY
1M and spend 10 racks for her to jump out a cake on my bday at resorts world.
My favorite part about this thread is the 50% saying itll tank and the other 50% saying its gonna keep going. We all have assholes right?
I would get it if they offer 3 month trial.
This mostly just looks like a chance to get into TSLA calls that I missed out on yesterday.

Really, *really* retarded stock rallies always have a moment of strong pullback before going even crazier than before.

But I’m a degenerate gambler, so what do I know?
I predict TSLA panic selling today.

We might even see TSLA minus 30 percent by the end of next week.

Shitty for anybody with calls, but you knew that bubble would eventually burst when you clicked on buy.
100k to whoever can make me a mil from 10k
Are stocks real in the Metaverse?  Do I still have to shower before I leave the house?
Idk would 250k be enough to cover your lifestyle AND a house AND pay taxes and maintenance for it forever?
It's going to be a green day.  Probably by open.
Id say my breaking point would be 35k. 30k? Id take katy. 40k? Give me 40k. 

Bitches aint worth anywhere near 1m.
I'm with you there man, sold early yesterday and made $400 instead of 3k off one call.  At least I sold before close though.
Spotify premium is the best thing in my life.

I see this turning into a exchange eventually
Why does everybody treat FB like evil incarnate? It has like 3 billion monthly users. There’s a discrepancy between the number of people calling for it to be scrapped and the number of people updating their relationship status. Pick a lane, people.
Decided to finally bite the bullet and try the Spotify 3 month trial and it wouldn't let me use my paypal account. Citing that the country I'm in doesn't match.

Switched to US and they only offer 1 month free trial.

I literally only need 250K and I'd be able to live pretty well outside of a few things

Even still, with 250k I could easily quit my current job and go do odd jobs and fuck all while managing my port

It's not so much about the amount, it's more about getting freedom to break out of our current lives
Being too poor to mess with TSLA options saved me.

Woke up on r/politics. Mistake
You don’t get it do you. Tesla can’t keep up with the demand of regular consumers as they are. Having an extra 200k doesn’t help because you can’t make them anyways 🤡

True. In Italy was an referendum to legalize 🌱 thats why weed stocks raise yesterday. Here in Germany the new government will probably will legalize it too, sooner or later. Same in the US. Hope that i will have 5k or more stocks at this point to retire with 40 🤪☀️

Lets the MMs know you're serious.
Exactly, I saw it as a bullish statement from Elon too, he just is too autistic to understand how everyone else would interpret what he said
So you're psychic, or you are great at interpretation of facts. Which is it?

Chill. Papa Elon provides.
TSLA is in the top ten most valuable companies in the world, but it can't even make money without heavy subsidies. The market value of the company is absolutely preposterous.
IV way up on news, yesterday was the morning to grab up $9 weekly calls
Yup, but it’s still rising in an earnings run up. Grab that cash

Wow christmas came early cause im boutta send it on these calls for TSLA
I agree with you on this.  I bet Elon and his buddies cashed out what they could yesterday so now the news starts coming out.
Hence why balls deep in calls
Besides this tweet I can't find anything other than an inquiry from the NHTSA back on October 13th. If it breaks to MSM later and doesn't tank then everything's always been priced in and always was.
I would need at least a 30-40% retracement before I'm going long again.I sold the last of my call contracts yesterday.

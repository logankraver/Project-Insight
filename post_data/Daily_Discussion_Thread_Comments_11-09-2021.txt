The next Daily Discussion thread is [here](https://redd.it/qqd61v)
Can anyone explain why NVDA is such a big deal in the comments today? It doesn't even seem like it moved all that much. Like over the week I get it but today specifically, I was expecting it to be up like $200
Yes but get taxed higher.  There is a way to trade SPX.
dumbass sold his position for BABA calls yesterday. üòÇ

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpltqg/181m_in_calls_switched_my_tsla_short_for_more/
11/12 1200C's for TSLA looking pretty tempting. Probably 10000000 baggers
Ending volume was insane, hope you grabbed your spy calls
They grew their lending business 2% last quarter, it‚Äôs a dud
#PENCILS DOWN
So I ended up being down a total of $906.34. What about you guys?
Yes I have thoughts
We will see 450s again before we 480
COIN will be up IMO.
Switched back to calls pops
I dont see enough Tesla loss porns. I am sure 50% of you retards must have held those 1300C until now.
Its ok portfolio you tried your best today we'll get them next time
this guy is why the anti vaxxers exist
Coin puts dash calls, got it!
Ban bet
Why? Is it "undervalued" now?
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/Grishen** bet **COIN** goes from **355.46** to **400.0** before **2021-11-23 15:59:53.455756-05:00**
Paper losses, diamond hands: grape yo puts

At least I can say I was a millionaire for a day.

Are there any major bullish *or* bearish catalysts coming up? I feel like there‚Äôs nothing really til next earnings season.

We‚Äôve had so many events with earnings and the fed it‚Äôs weird the calendar feels empty
 Tesla $1200 11/26  call secured
LFG
$80MM traded in shares today
!banbet $COIN 400 2w
Sell
Bought some puts today. I'm ashamed of myself.
Not buying but I will watch to see if your prediction is true
35% down from the high is unlikely brolaf. Good luck tho
Episode 5 of The Premise is the best dramatic presentation of the DDs in this sub
It's been forever since I've played an earnings. Forgot the excitement. Feels like Christmas eve
To everyone saying ‚ÄúElOn HaSnT EvEN SoLd YEt‚Äù 
And touching themselves to the thought of their high IV puts‚Ä¶ 

He is selling 2%. Most likely in staggered sales. Calm down.
Allbirds getting wrecked. Makes sense.
Party‚Äôs over üåà üêª back to ful throttle bull semen tomorrow
Elon really fucked me good this week
You'll know if he sold this week. He needs to file with the SEC.
Probably only retards that bought &gt;$1000
Sell
COIN calls, DASH puts üöÄ
Same, mainly because I'm down 50%.
Lmao thanks bro, hoping that I can get out early in the morningüòπ
 it is my META favorite but right now the market sentiment is too high
Tesla calls tomororw for sure
I think both AAL and F will go up overnight
At this point it's a crap shoot. Either way, going to take a break for a bit regardless.
Don't let em fool ya, living under the I-5 ain't that bad.
NIO 60C was so cheap, I can't believe y'all missed out
yeah too many apes joined. now we have to share with the local rabble from the front page. everyday I feel dirty they are even allowed to comment.
Get fucked MMs - I sat on my hands all day!
Used to happen to me a lot when I worked in subway tunnels far away from a bathroom. Eventually started fasting for most of my work shift and havent had an issue in a few years
Thoughts on Sofi earnings tomorrow?
Bulls haven't capitulated yet. Too many people thinking their just buying the dip. Not over yet
people here seem to be forgetting tapering begins towards end of november
Please die! Could use a win today ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Mara historically but this week it's alot closer
Ass, grass or cash. No one rides for free.
Cuz I dumped my puts
&gt;stop buying options  
  
Mods, pls ban this person
Rally until end of time
Riot has more room to run, but Mara is a more profitable company. You pick.
Anyone that bought TSLA at those prices deserves what comes next.
So you received my valentine's card?
I said sane
I feel like I know you. Fuck you.
Spy ripping $468 coming
RIOT
Even when i try to buy puts i end up with calls.

Perma bull, got 3 spy 470 11/10

First and last time playing tsla not because I lost money but way too volatile for my liking
God I hope we moon tomorrow I'll be hard as a rock
No shit Tesla would crash first in a bubble bursting. But just because Tesla crashes doesn‚Äôt mean the bubble is popping. It has more to do with Elon adding an unnecessary amount of risk to holding the stock the market is now pricing in, combined with a stupid rally over the past 3 months
Fingerscrossed on PLUG and NIO
fuck it, im buying COIN calls. preparing my funeral as we speak
Then why did LVS suck last earnings
EDGELORDE FORCED TO PAY TENS OF BILLIONS IN TAXES FOR PELOSI CAPITALS CALLS TO PRINT‚Ä¶UMMM..I MEAN COMMON PROSPERITY. Imagine thinking the US is better at capitalism than China.
Tsla opens at 1150 tomorrow
I‚Äôve diamond-handed my DASH puts to 90% loss right now. IV crush should be the icing on the cake

TSLA Could drop 80% and STILL be overvalued. Think about that for a minute.
Riot or Mara?
CANYONEROOOO!!!! üêì
Tsla gonna drop below 1k LOL
17% in two days is pretty hefty
Where's the guy with the $200K TSLA short position?  Wonder if he closed some down?
SPY
My puts are so ready
Watching Amazon Shorts covering Live lolol
I totally forgot, what happened in Feb again?
Europoors probably seething over the fact Ameripoors let Tesla fall
All money is fake coins asshole
All the numbers in your comment added up to 420. Congrats!

    300 +
    90 +
    30 +
    = 420.0
Once Tesla breaks 1000... the dip will be biblical compared to it's current dip. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)

‚Ä¶that‚Äôs the bonus, it‚Äôs actually pretty solid.  AUM is growing daily‚Ä¶ doubled in last two weeks
Thanks i needed this. I watched my spreads go from +300% at the very last minute yesterday to -90% 30min into market open when I could finally check. I could be sick
So Musk sold?
I feel that just depends on how much cash you have, not sanity. If I had a milly in my account I'd have no problem buying hundreds of calls at a time.
Should have FOMO'd into RBLX huh
Anyone in $U unity??
You mean -10 percent instead of -12?
Ban
I'm holding the calls I was planning on closing. I'm gambling on this one so it will probably be down.
WISH is up 5% while all the other meme's are blood red. People really thinking they're going to have positive earnings?
Both!
Don‚Äôt do that SPY‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt give me hope
I'm down 80% today from yesterday
They're real. Talk to anyone that imports products for a living. 

The price of a cargo container is 10x what it was pre-covid
It's always funny to me that there are some legit traders in here. People that have multimillion dollar portfolios. I remember old WSB, there was a lot more of that. There was a shit ton of DD with screenshots from Bloomberg terminal and they were super in-depth and technical. People would be up millions and they'd just be like 'meh'. It used to feel like you were a fly on the wall right next to the water cooler of some large fund. Good times. Way easier to make money then too.
NVDA and SPY playing dead all day and going to start picking up at the end, of course
You a bitch
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
Lock in those gains! Or atleast sell half
weeeeeee get fucked by PLTR hard today
I used to go to the casino to play craps, and when it was my turn to shoot, all the players would load up all the bets, and I would start off the first few rolls real good and the players would double down and I would crap out and everyone would lose. One time it literally took me 2 rolls to fuck over a group of 12 people. My investment are starting to feel the same way
Y?
As someone that has zero interest in going to a god forsakin theme park I would check out a virtual metaverse type Disney experience.
CANYONEROOOO!!!! üêì
tsla bears are getting raped bad tonight. puts here are too good to be true.
Well, the die is cast. Hope DASH burns.
Those green dildos got me thinking they will pump ES F again overnight
SPY trying for green EOD lol

I am not ready to be hurt again !! So soon

Damn I already bought and can‚Äôt sell because of pattern day trading. Fuck it
Just bought a bunch of NIO puts, This absolutely can't go tits up
PYPL mooning.
Okay TSLA bulls point on the doll where Elon touched you
Puts on ADT?
You‚Äôll make a man happy one day.
I'd award you, but I am poor. Thanks anyway.
Post after earnings please
MODS
Dear Mr Bear,

I write in gratitude, as you continue to oblige me and others with buying opportunities that would in normal markets be regarded as 'retarded'.

Yours most sincerely,

Permander ("Perma") Bull, Esq.

TSLA 3/22 1500c.
Imagine buying poots
Shit, if tsla ends the day in this downward trend then the selling will continue onto tomorrow‚Ä¶.
Those profits still wouldn‚Äôt cover the fees on a doordash order
Fuck em all!!  Yes sir!!! Good luck to us both
To catch people like me with our pants around our ankles
Some of y‚Äôall make me question if all you think about all day is Elon
4 minutes what calls to buy
Do I hold NIO through earnings‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.?
why does this feel like february all over again
Trying to be a money maker with that delta hedge of near 0?
TSLA 1300 end of month
PYPL just flew up
Got COIN puts ready
Same brain dead as usual

What did you get?
Sell RBLX weekly calls EOD or wait for tomorrow?
Why did TSLA dump today and not yesterday?
I wish robinhood would restrict TSLA selling
COIN or UPST puts for tonight's earnings?  ü§î

edit: IV is too high  üòî
SPY is an ETF that follows the SPX
Sorry can‚Äôt hear you I‚Äôm revenge trading my portfolio to zero
Calls because puts are the obvious play.
$DASH ER play?
Yeah. Don't try to dig yourself out of a hole. Wait for an opportunity.
Sell
Too aggressive IMO. I'd do 230 / 240C for January if you were bullish on it.
During a chip shortage? Lmao u belong here
Imagine going all in on sdc though
Elon hasn‚Äôt even sold yet. Is tesla actually doomed
Damn
I could see tesla sliding into the 900‚Äôs towards the close here
Just a little $162 dollar swing today
These supply chain shortage is starting to sound fake as fuck. SPY 500 EOW.
Yeah go long on spy and buy the dips
He was giving a heads up
It would be pretty cool if $PLUG fell 50% when they report negative earnings. Would shut the fucking youtube and twitter traders up
If FUBO opens at $40 I‚Äôm gonna eat a pencil!
Bad choice
I‚Äôm too poor for those options anyway those are juiced to the tits
Can‚Äôt wait for Disney to announce they too will be joining the metaverse tomorrow. Single day tickets will be $100 to visit Magic Kingdom in the metaverse
Same. I might be fucking braindead because earnings plays are always counterintuitive
All in at X5 leverage on DASH short position

Sure buddy
Buyden needs to sign that shit asap
Then where's the Form 4?

You‚Äôre my favorite ostrich on here
DIP buy opportunities on FUBO right before ER! Get in and get rich or stay poor

LMFAO Elon has sold none yet, this thing is fucked.
Well, my limp dick 1 TSLA short is having a blast.
It's one of those days where I didn't watch the red. Just go and learned how to deboned chicken leg quarters, cook up my fancy stuffed boneless leg quarters with herbed potatoes. Making broth from the bones for potato soup later and chill. Helps keep my blood pressure down üòÇ
As of today based on future free cash flow models Tesla fair value in 2030 is 1500 and NIO is 700. Until edgelorde surprises us with new stuff this figure holds true. Buy the US bubble at the top, sell gyna at the bottom. tHe mErICAN wAy, the WSB way ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

F and AAL calls at close.
&gt; You can't trade SPX in TDA.
Oof. The fact that it didn‚Äôt TANK immediately after rising &gt;150 bc of serious profit taking is a sign to not short it. But do you.
Have you seen the IV on those
No he didn‚Äôt
Heard they are doing tik tok style short videos for kids
PayPal June 240c ? Worth it. Will it be back up to 280?
is it dumb to pick up some PYPL 260 / 270C for January? Wonder if that's enough time for it to rebound
PayPal did me dirty, I need some Jesus in my life for this coin call
How does one trade SPX?  I don't see it in TDA.
Oh shit Elon gonna have to move next door to my tent on skid row
Feb 18 250c LFG
Me too, if only for all the tards buying it by accident in December
I am here to lose all my money and most of yours
seeing as the virtual assets that leave me unable to find an RTX video card are considered a "hedge" (I have no Idea why). You might see an inverse, but similarly, you may not as it goes from hands of many to hands of few, and whether those few go out and buy lambos and blow it all on cocaine remains to be seen, its best to just view them as alternative stocks.

Yes
Gonna buy the post earnings dip. Likely to dump cause Mouse has been shitty all year but don't wanna short him
Yes
Worse than the GME Ape conspiracy they came up with. Back to your room.
As long as we aren't flat tomorrow I'll be ok..
I assume put holders were IV crushed
I think it'll fall for a couple of days. Looking to get in around 812
$8500 in DASH puts. Wish us all luck!
speaking from experience - RH is much better for options due to their UI and the transparency of the option chain (you can scroll thru by ticker and see everything without individually selecting each option). the prices and fills will be identical. I use RH to sort through options then actually buy / execute on fidelity.
It will drop sub 1000 tomorrow‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.just a hunch though.    Still, I don‚Äôt like having open positions over night so sold my puts a few min ago.
If you‚Äôre asking this then the answer is neither
At this point fuck tesla if it drops at least let PLUG moon after ER
Sold my call today since iv spiked, might regret it tomorrow but profits are profits
Up
Ahhh gotta love the slap of realization that I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing
jeezus. I can't even imagine dropping that much on one contract (especially a tesla put!). Mind sharing how much youre up?
I did I did
Lol you‚Äôre a genuine idiot if you think the corn market is genuinely worth &gt; 3T. It‚Äôs just hype. Can make money, but you better get out soon cuz this shits gonna crash and burn.
Haha!  Good luck with that, it was the one name in my port that didn't get whacked in today's bear-buffet
Guys if you‚Äôre down today, go talk a long walk and gather yourself. Don‚Äôt be that guy who panics and makes it worse. And above all NEVER GIVE UP
Yes. Won't go tits up. Trust me!
Yeah that‚Äôs fucked.  3 days left for that too lol.
buy calls or puts right now?
Calls, q4 guidance should be strong from the recent spike in price/volume
Uh
F and SOFI bringing me back from the brink of homelessness.
Don't worry, I did it for you. 

In retrospect, really stupid play
Tomorrow a $2 gap up on Spy we at 469 run to 52 week high over 470
Nah. Possibly premarket, but not EOD
Only a mistake if you didn‚Äôt buy them

elon tweeted hell start selling next week
Too many buy limits at a hair over 1,000
Nio Up or down ?
go for it if you hate money

Feel like it's gonna dump.
You guys think TSLA will dip below 1k before EOD or nah?
People who have no idea what they're doing
Got some but getting out tomorrow before ER
It will be hilarious if we learn elon hasn‚Äôt sold as of today.
[deleted]
Dash to fucking 0
Conspiracy theory: Elon already sold 10% his stock and has the cash on hand for his tax bill.  He just want to cause a dip to buy some shares at a discount.
If people lose all their money will they put the money they don't have into stocks. 

Yes
Cause I don't believe in fake corns
Stocks can go up or down damn man this shit is crazy
sell half and secure the initial investment. rest is house money

#SERENITY NOW!!!
First in line
Coin is so stupid to hold that it will go up. Yet I can't get myself to do it. Enjoy your gains retards
Tesla? Sounds üêª, so not thanks, I'm not üåà
Bum lmaooo
Puts.
That rejection was pretty rough though maybe not
Take a breather buddy, a 9% loss isn‚Äôt as bad as it could be.
Not enough yet
that‚Äôs tough. how much did you put in? why are you buying such short dated options?
?
Who‚Äôs buying 1DTE SPY calls at close?
So two weeks of gains lost in a single day? That's not concerning at all...
I‚Äôd like to report that I was able to show self discipline and not get burned by UWMC for what would have been the fourth time
TSLA with the take-out! Probably caught a bunch of retards who thought it was gonna keep going up! ü§≠üòÇ
Right one there are a ton of people waiting to see if they can buy the dip. The way TSLA finishes today will determine if people feel the bottom is in today. I think if it continues to slide many people will risk buying at open tomorrow. However, if there is a weak recovery EOD and people don't have faith in it, it'll probably go down more tomorrow and we'll probably test the 950-970 range.
Tesla gonna close at 1000$?
Why
Nice, I got some 12/17 60c to play little safer. Hope we both eat soon
There is a gap at the mid 950 mark to fill. Fill your bags.
I hear he sold at a loss and switched to BABA, unless I'm thinking of someone else
Trash market activate.
This guy used to fuck.
Bought some dash puts so if you hate money do the same
Lul. I put $300 in calls a week ago. So technically yes. In reality not really.
loss? im up lol
Jesus how much lower will Tesla go what are our thoughts?
Everyone forget about Nio
WYNN going uppies?
Sell TSLA buy NKLA. Few understand this
468 and I‚Äôll suck a dick right now
im guessing initially the market would tank also.
IV crush is massive.
I think you need r/investing
&gt; Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla. He also founded SpaceX and Paypal
Last year during the rip i bought like 2 week near the money spy puts for like 1k and that was the last time i was gay
ther is no actual money if it crashes
I find it interesting that all day CNBC was going to have Auroras CEO on before earnings and now it‚Äôs going to be after.  Me thinks MM was scared of the affect on TLRY
I would immediately fund the account
Fax PayPal too
Spy powerhour
Feeling pretty good about selling a decent amount at $1229, sad for all the tendies I'm loosing keeping the rest in.
*Ford starts finally recovering to baseline*

TSLA: how about another serving of fuck you?
Women so you wouldn't know anything about that.  My wife and her boyfriend watch it all the time....no wait.
TSLA isn‚Äôt even oversold on RSI yet üòÇ chillin at 52

~~Martydom~~ Tesla: Drop a live grenade when killed

Tesla Price Levels not seen since, ‚Äúchecks notes‚Äù Oct 26th.
I bought 80 more shares but I also bought $1000 put and selling covered calls to hedge as much as I can
[deleted]
that TSLA short guy (bluewhalevalue or whatever) must be creaming his pants right about now
Now that all the Tesla weak hands have been shaken out we can resume the moon mission at 1k
We'll know when the SEC Form 4 shows up.
I think you need a butt plug to do that
QUICKLY GIVE ME 20X PLAY BEFORE CLOSE
I really as m hoping plug is the next roblox like earning play
Gap to fill in the 900s by the way. Most of the time GAPS always fill. So I suspect $800 very possible with Musky selling off soon as well. Cathie will sure be off loading more shares.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
So‚Ä¶ go all in tsla ?
I know pltr is shit, but it's oversold
1000k or bust
This is what I am here for.
More like power bottom
like ever or today?
Tesla die now so I can buy cheap
5k bro?

Dudes here lose 100k on a single bet.

What a whineass
If Internet money crashes(personally think it will) would it be correct to assume that the stock market would benefit greatly from it since the influx of money would be taken out and put into the market? üßê
He's cashing out on his overvalued stock while he still can
OCGN going back to .80c, nice
oh god we're pumping too early, watch it take a reverse dump on us
I refuse to accept this
Hold NVDA weeklies $310c 11/12 or sell at -30%?
So‚Ä¶ how many Tesla bag holders are here?
Ban you
Gonna need an update from the guy who bought a shit load of Tesla puts last week or the week before. Shit is printing


Edit* apparently he sold yesterday. He does belong here.
Coinbase offering options trading would lead to a massive rally.
I'm waiting for it to hit 800
Tesla of course
&gt; Yeah, that was a great trade. I made over $1 million on it
WYNN TO 130!!
lol she bought at IPO man. it went to 52 weeks low and no one says anything. just buy big tech and hold.

market only goes up.
DASH got fucked last earnings and it hardly moved. I'm not touching that with a ten foot pole.
You would be nuts if you did
ah dang, Oregon state over here haha
Hertz can‚Äôt afford to pay the bill
I‚Äôm here to day trade and buy an insane amount of spy calls. And I‚Äôm all out of day trades
My wallet
Who wants to bet me 100 bucks it wont go under 1000
Just realized HUYA had earnings this morning.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember how hard that was shilled, many times, last year? Guess all those guys are gone.
I lost 62k today alone
Is TSLA still deading?
Damn this is too easy Spy running up into close . Never fails . Grabbed 469 calls
COIN
Surprised to find someone else here in on snap. Yea this thing is atleast getting to 58. Rotated my TSLA put profits from today into SNAP 60 11/26 C‚Äôs.
Didn't Fidelity also just prevent people from buying certain stocks lmao
META etf Calls, any of them really üìàüöÄüöÄüöÄ
TSLA premiums too high imo
Prepare to rip
Fucking hard cunt right here
SPY EOD 466.50
SPY strangle gang for tomorrow‚Äôs CPI numbers
That‚Äôs only a matter of time. I‚Äôm thinking higher but I‚Äôm in it for the long game
I think dash is leading vs grub but idk market doesn‚Äôt really make sense
Wow called it
Dang $TSLA might as well dip to $800 this week. Elon hasn‚Äôt even sold yet
TSLA 1K EOD?
I wonder how much his puts are banking him, so he can buy back on the cheap
Been pumping it here. Easy calls. Don‚Äôt sweat dash. Take free money. Sell at open. 
Position: 95/100c 11/12
Coin wants to do that ting so bad
I have a newfound respect for gay bears. It takes a lot of courage - and a level of retardation, to even think about shorting anything.
Imagine the God complex Elon must feel every time he visits WSB just to see a bunch of degenerate peasants constantly talking about him.
I‚Äôm about to study the gain porn from TSLA puts to figure out how put options work
Can‚Äôt wait for FUBO earnings report in 20 minutes, millionaire maker stock
Being jacked to the tits on weeklies and monthlies is exhilarating
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
If you think TSLA isn't going to go lower, take a look at the monthly chart. Shit could still fall another 12% tomorrow and be up 10% for the month
In an alternative universe instead of Elon making a poll he announced a stock split lauching Tesla to 1700
Don‚Äôt worry spy stay up today tomorrow tsla taking you down to hell with it
I went from $55k to $50k in the past 20 days. I absolutely hate myself and invested everything into VTI instead. Idk what to do. How could I lose 5k like that
Im on that also
Y‚Äôall holding COIN ü™ô over earnings or
Nah? I hope it lives up to the hype that has been created üòíüòíüòí
WSB membership still rising.  Calls on retards.
How many times did Mr. RBLX say ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù on its earnings call?

Got a few companies I would like to slide that information to before it‚Äôs too late.
Give me an illegal spy pump
knowing this con ass market, tsla calls have a chance to print tonight. everyone‚Äôs gonna load up on puts
I pciked up some NEGG 20c just in case this whore runs like July tomorrow.

**My first big puts ever and it's on Tesla**

You can thank me guys. The first one's free I hear.
Yea literally bought rblx calls because Pelosi bought thousands of shares and she corrupt as fuck. 

5bagger from that old hag.
Elon Musk losing more money than any other man in history today. He is such a great steward of capital with his twitter trolls
I have only $45 settled cash left so I am buying 1 share of Chinese Tesla for not missing the earnings. Feels like a addiction at this point.
grow up loser
TSLA no longer 1T cap soon haha
&gt; :4640:

What does this mean??
üî¥OHIOüî¥
Feels so good to dump AMC even at a loss
Did Elon even start selling yet?
when does the market close
Hey Elon

If you could announce the split now that would be reeeeal nice
Seriously guys‚Ä¶ ever since I deleted robinhood from them not allowing buying certain stocks and went to fidelity, I‚Äôve yet to see one of my option plays be in the positive after holding it for 24 hours. Should I swallow my pride and switch back?? I‚Äôve only done 4 option plays with fidelity but still‚Ä¶
SNAP to 60 soon
I feel like calling mods gay is a compliment at this point smfh
So not only did HOOD stop you from buying, they have now "lost" all your personal information.

Be prepared to get bombarded by junk calls and/or be frauded by russian mafia lol
True, but serious question. I genuine wanna know why is grub hub trading $14 and dash is $190? Very similar companies with a massive difference in valuation.
I know. But the terms of my bet were dumb so I tried to change it haha.
nah go down
TSLA dump is sus‚Ä¶there might be some damning news on the way

Should I bag it until tomorrow or count the losses ?
Fuck it. 5k short position on DASH. Options premiums were too high.
TSLA under 1000 by market close?
Thanks babe
Do I sell my SNDL calls and accept doubling my money, or do I wait until tomorrow and feel like an idiot when they drop again ü§îü§îü§îüß†

Holy shit Daddy Elon I‚Äôm quaking in boots
I felt real slick using my cash to buy ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù TSLA calls yesterday only for them to get ripped apart today.
Tsla 1060 puts are up 600% if you bought at open.
Sdc hasn't found its floor yet. Company will probably be out of business in a few years.
Tesla puts guy follow up!! He was shorting TSLA but switched to BABA calls yesterday. Sucks for that guy! https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpltqg/181m_in_calls_switched_my_tsla_short_for_more/
Yall know the coin casino is open 24/7 right
TLRY looking to explode if we can hold this level
No
Nope. Gotta go through the SEC first. Then he has 3 days to sell
0%
Just so you all know. This mf commented he was up $700k for the year. 

Positions or ban faggot
How is Spy only down less than 0.5% when TSLA is down over 12%
I meant to sell all my shares when I saw it above $20. $F is now a penny stock.
maid guy sucking dick tonight. Tsla 1k
Fuck it. Bought 10 11/18 18p. Might go tits up.
I knew I should'nt have bought that single TSLA share yesterday at $1150....
How low will Tesla go?
I love it when the bears get cocky. Definite reversal coming overnight.

 PROG gonna moon. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
I have now discovered the only way to make money on AMC is but puts!
I got a feeling dash is gonna crash. Pandemic stocks are all coming to their end of run. Door dash is fucking high as chit compared to grub hub. Very similar companies that have totally different trends. I'm no expert but I am being dash is about to get the peleton dump.
To the moon üåô or to the grave üíÄ no inbetween
Ban bet or gtfo
I got your back. I bought puts, so surely it'll moon, cause fuck me.

buying TSLA at $911
Tsla looking juicy
Damn premiums on DASH puts are insanely high
&gt; I think you are a genius.
Shit... so close to 1000
Why?
If TSLA could just die after hours so it stops destroying the entire market, that'd be great
Drill team 6 putting all of its focus on TSLA
Give it some time to cover up üòÇüòÇ
Lol still up more than you‚Äôll ever be.
Me taking alot of profit on tesla at $1080 was a 2 IQ move when it went to $1200+ 

Now i feel like a genius
I will go go down with thiiiiis ship. 
And i wont put my calls up, and surrender...
those of you who are holding tsla puts over night you guys got balls lol. And Doordash is being shilled here so I'm not gonna touch it lol

That same dude did it to my account too.  Fuck that guy.
Sell before close
Wtf lol 40m volume spy. Man the insane volatility spy days were peak for options rush like 70M
Feel like port delays and container hikes affected their suppliers this quarter.
Not today, no.
Ouch Elon plz stop that's a bad touch
I am such a retard. I just sold covered calls on WISH and didn‚Äôt even realize earnings was tomorrow.
NY lottery game

It always astounds me how much you idiots completely misunderstand how volume works.

But, sure, totally amazing that something that costs less than $3 might move that much. Can‚Äôt figure that one out.
[deleted]
With those premiums? Hell no. IV crush is gonna kill your options.
So confident
I love seasonal gambling. Earnings season is my favorite.
todays SP500 is -.5%, half of it is about Elon tweet, half of it is about JPOW not getting renominated. Yet SEC is calling MEME stocks financial stabilities risk ü§°ü§°ü§°

Tsla stock split announcement after hour
if anyone sees this, to make money in the next hour, buy VRM, vroom is about to take off like CAR

Who still bag holding tesla shares?
At that point that person wanted a ban
Some one didn't buy Puts! LOL!
NVDA will close 306 just to say it had a red day. Same with AMD at 129. Then it has permission to launch.
Yo Fidelity where‚Äôs my free 100 bucks? Anyone else signed up with that promo got the free money?
I should just hold my TSLA $1150 1/20/22's right?
464p 11/10
Any chance dash drops to 100?
you just lose more slowly
i hate when that happens
Two of three plays have gone south. Let‚Äôs see if affirm goes for a threepeat.
I did this morning in a panic @ $1,058
I was told SPY 470 EOD
I can't believe this TSLA rally. Peoples calls are saved
Is AMC pretty much ded?
it's easy, stop paying your staff in stock, so stockholders see the real costs and not the constant dilutions and a better performing company than reality
Ha. You set me up. Too easy. I made big mistakes this week too. I'm horrible.
TSLA HULK DICK INBOUND üíπ
It's OK. I've only lost 26k this week. Time for Ramen and cyanide.

I looked him right in the eyes up close, could feel the hot breath , see the spit coming out as I screamed you fucking idiot who do you think you are, picking these stocks, calls puts you fuck...my money gone..


Then my wife asked me why I was screaming at the mirror.
TSLA Hertz Longs
&gt; :4886: 

What does this mean?
MELI you muppets, I told you when it had dropped to $1500ish. Them and COST, when you see it dump, buy calls to return to the ATH 3-6 months out and they consistently do

Honestly just take out the scene with the old native American guy saying to embrace death and I wouldn't even consider it death cult shit. That would make it a LOT better, almost as good as Trigun.

I thought it was mainly a show about a hungry corgi trying to get fed though, the 3 depressed human characters seem more like instruments of plot that are there because the dog can't talk or do much on its own

Nothing is going to save tesla's reckoning todayüòÇüòÇ
Tastyworks was made for complex strategies. Super easy to setup and monitor. ToS is similar because it was made by the same team.
I‚Äôm thinking calls a year out
Only think for sure is that it‚Äôll be 85% of that number after earnings.
It is up but if cash flows are something to go by, it is extremely undervalued. Provided they can maintain this level of cash flows.
fml. down 2% thanks to amd. there are kids in ethiopia who are better off than me
Stock go up, stock go down. You can't explain that

Just wait til it goes down more after
It almost came back to 10. It‚Äôs just being heavily shorted and manipulated.
How you getting back home?
Safety and or speculation on higher bond prices to sell or they think yields will be higher soon

Okay bears you‚Äôve had your fun turn SPY back green now
Guidance is way more important because the price reflects future earnings. If a stock is tanking after it beats, then it's probably because guidance has been revised downwards.
NVDA going to rank earnings. Semiconductor shortage means less products to sell
gahdamn i took ass-whooping on Tesla calls this week, I'm out until next Monday need to just shitpost and follow the market otherwise goodbye OCT gains

I would have played MNDY earnings but it's up 15% before they're even out
&gt; UPST is going down.
I'm getting thetagaped right now, and I'm not having fun.
I would personally sell and re-enter on a pullback, either as a free position or 2x contracts
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen at earnings but DASH being valued at $65bn is hilarious. The valuations in this market continue to amaze me. 

Without a major catalyst we could just slowly see multiple compression as the fed tapers and raises interest rates next year. If that‚Äôs the case these negative 1% days will be more common. 

Logic can continue to not matter though and we hit SPY 500 by EOY.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
COIN has run up so much for earnings they'd have to announce something huge for it to moon afterwards
those of you who are sane, how many call contracts do you typically buy at a time?

Given the hype surrounding COIN ü™ô earnings I‚Äôm really suspicious that it will be flat üòíüòíüòí

I agree this is the top
Tlry has more of a chance then gme trash you moron
I said it once il say it again NKLA is going to fucking moon
Whats up with the shit show Rivian???
Alexa play Donald Trump numa numa
SPY has found love in it‚Äôs heart
TSLA 1000 is very realistic and might see that tomorrow if sell off continues. Could be a support lvl or it could just free fall through it. Either way I sold my puts for a huge gain since I have no idea where this thing will go short term.
People with large noses are more evolved. Apes have flat noses with flared nostrils. Most nobility in history tend to have larger noses, and it denotes power, authority, and wisdom. Flat noses are considered more cute though so you got that.
TSLA just dump already. So close to a cyber truck from these puts last couple days.

He's probably using a free robinhood gold trial. It's not margin, his bank account is going to get overdrafted once robinhood takes the money out of his account it just takes a few days to settle. Oh. and he might also receive some sort of penalty from robinhood.
/u/cashflow_ yesterday I asked you how your day was, but /u/zjz's evil script removed the comment for being too short or too similar to other recent comments.

Bring back approved users you monster, we need to know how cashflow is doing.
Bro, if you haven't already you've been losing out on a shit ton of money. Here's a secret to make you feel better: The reason it's been trading within its range is because option sellers are keeping it there to collect premiums. They aren't going to change that until idiots stop buying overpriced options
I‚Äôm getting 3x margin compared to Robinhood on E*TRADE and Fidelity. To each his own.
Definitely sucks to see all the action and can't do shit

I don't like doing it this way

I prefer diagonal spreads, with 80 delta leaps and selling weeklies

the capital needed for the leaps is much lower than the 100 shares and for very low premium
seems to be a daily swing for me the last couple months. between TSLA and MARA

I know y‚Äôall like to jump on a stock only after it‚Äôs up 50% but if you want something at the bottom ready to üöÄ look at $ROKU! It‚Äôs holding its support level really well and will go to $700 at least by Q1! üåô

That‚Äôs what I have, u could do puts if you think rivian is going to dump tomorrow
This isn‚Äôt financial advice but this may be a good time to buy calls
trying to pump those numbers, looks like dis+ is stagnant, and the stock was moving prior cause of it. looks like DIS needs the parks to blow out plus have some bullish outlook. idk. may only throw a small position tomorrow for earnings, i had a bigger position but sold at open today, didnt like the sub deal

1)  


2)  


3)  


?
I never bet against America, and long term have not seen SPY do anything but blow expectations out of the water.

But it do be makin me nervous and I'm way over leveraged.
Kinda sorta

Really just long term hold + selling calls 

I can see TSLA $2000 in a year or two

There‚Äôs no other stock retail loves like TSLA for the moment. When something takes that spotlight, I‚Äôll close out

Macau casinos took a beating last month‚Ä¶ but maybe good guidance for online sports betting? Tough to say
no, just anticipation of his sale. it doesn't work like that for CEOs. Executives have to file with the SEC prior to purchases and sales. If he files (I think it's 10-B or 83-B), he will have to follow a mandate to sell at predetermined lots over a period of time. If he sold 10% of his stake at once the stock would collapse.
been making consistent money off not far OTM calls the last 3 weeks.

luckily i sold at open lol

Weed stocks still cheap

Get in before legalization makes them take off

You're blind right?
Is it worth hedging my nio stock and leaps position with puts this earnings?
If spy closes at 465 today, bulls cancel thanksgiving
Kinda mad that the one earnings play I‚Äôve been waiting on for weeks is coming to fruition during this shitshow of a day. Calls are up tho, so not that mad üåö
Honestly it was first time doing options, monday I was up, should have sold out. Guess it's part of the learning experience
no way, Amazon will keep cycling back and forth, between 3100s and 3500s+,at least for a while longer
so it is possible :/
Cause I just smoked weed
Market still has an hour dammit!
Yes it is. TSLA 800 isn‚Äôt a meme though.
Is this the only red day this week, yes or no?
AMD: Tomorrow Facebooks gives us more information on the chips guiding their metaverse expansion. Next week will be huge. Earnings for nvidia on the 16th, we will get sympathy, then Samsung - AMD collaboration announced in June but no device shown so not priced in. We will get phones with AMD mobile gpu on 19th. We will rally, position now and buy before the hedge funds so they‚Äôre forced to buy and not sell the news.
Could go up, could go down. No different than any earnings play
Because US legalization is looming
got out of my call at +40% too chicken to hold through earnings
Last hour of trading. Tends to be a little volatile

precisely. Have this ü•à

I‚Äôd rather you be correct

Lol with a username like that.
PLTR now in range I guess
Fucking apes, no real trader actually hates Robinhood any more than another brokerage.

Only apes seem to be hung up on this bullshit "the market should be for social justice". Understand that MM's and investment funds run the market, and retail is just trying to get in/out around them.
TSLA bled for the cucks wanting in on RIVN, change my mind

I hope that everyone here understands that the market doesn‚Äôt have rules anymore. You get lucky or you don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre better off going on hunches than anything at this point. We have companies producing awesome earnings and trading down 10% the next day. We have companies valued as the highest company in existence that don‚Äôt produce shit.

Just gamble and what you can‚Äôt afford to gamble stick in blue chips and move on. Fuck it. What a clown show.

Yup. Forget GME, just buy LRC. Way better returns

I don‚Äôt do financial advice, but probably not meme stocks.
I should've put 10k into IONq at $10 instead of $100
Two other things I've kinda picked up as I've practiced:

Any option play I make is a play in which I've made my peace that I could potentially lose everything and end up with a worthless play. I will always take an OTM option versus an ATM option because the Delta is higher. What that means is that I will never commit more than 5% of my total equity to any one play, and I won't get shaken out unless I become convinced my thesis is wrong.

The other thing is that not all stocks make good option plays. Usually stocks that do more than a million in total shares traded have more liquid option markets, as opposed to stocks that do a 100K, and leave you much less able to get out. 

Finally, when I look at the option chain, if the position I'm interested in has already moved 100%, I won't take the play, since my chances of making more money usually aren't there.

were do you trade? ya on ToS, for options it takes as much as 4days, sometimes it can process faster/clear, the quickiest way to get it to clear is to wire it to your acct, it costs $25, and thats 1 day max.

jesus these coinbase options are so expensive
agree with your theory. the ev tax credit being higher for 'union' ev manufactures and less for non union although us made manufactures is really a discriminatory attack on not only tesla but many other ev manufactures. hopefully it won't pass as is currently written.

Sir, I‚Äôm in class
i live in bogota colombia - their phones here have always been unattainable here and in most other non-gringo countries - but here the phone companies (claro, movistar, etc) have started paying for the phones with agreements, the way ATT and Sprint used to do back in the day.  with more users comes more services, they still have excellent growth potential with 5G, with AppleTV+, with app fees - all of the business channels will grow as their user base grows -    

been buying since 2011  - project TITAN  

I complain a lot about them, esp with nvda and tsla climb 80% in months while AAPL seems to be stagnant.  But over the past 5 years AAPL has gone up 450%.    

Finally, if buffet is going to keep 5.5% of BRKA in AAPL, as anal as that guy is.. they can't be all bad.. he's in with the board and must know something.
Wrong. Enjoy the US recession

I don‚Äôt get Rblx.  They barely beat earnings expectations.  Are still negative.  And their stock jumped 35% on day when the rest of the market is down.   What on earth?   I‚Äôm buying a later Nov put at end of Day.

The fact that some Americans legit thought that the S&amp;P and Tesla was going to infinity and gyna is going to zero was all the indication I needed to know this purge was coming.

Market: Shambles                  Meal: Campbells
So they are long on GME? BULLISH
Scalped a little bit in AMD but I'm feeling extra uncertain buying weekly calls on a stock that's still up 16% compared to last week. Made a nice 15% over like an hour, I don't have the temerity to hold these overnight anymore. Going to go fuck around in PLTR some more I guess. At least when I lose there it just sets me up to win harder in the future.
Elon doesn't need money. He has been clear on his first in last out mentality. 

Can't blame executives who take profit, I just don't think Elon is as concerned about that as others.
Dash feeling like pypl
It is overvalued but it also will recover
I highly doubt that they will. DoorDash is a well run company
I WILL NEVER COME OUT! I AM A DEEPLY CLOSETED HOMOSEXUAL!

PTON now wants to charge 495 for basically an Xbox Kinect camera‚Ä¶

His tranches give him the right to buy 8 million shares. Given the total outstanding, and the fact he hates shorts, he will buy existing shares.

Stay back bears! I can hear you all furiously masturbating from here.
Sec is watching him.  So he pretends he will sell 10% after his brother sells 109million$. Market drops. His brother buys back his shares pocketing the difference and Elon doesn‚Äôt sell of shares yet (telling everyone such) which causes the price to jump back up.  Then Elon sells his exorcised options into buying strength.

He has till August to execute the buy, which I am assuming will run the price up when executed.

Lets See how low they can bring it üòÖ i think that it is already
i know and they still are trying to catch it even now
Decided to buy a 4$ SDC call while it was below 4.30$.
Will DoorDash plummet. Yes. Will u make bank. Yes. Is it free money. Yes. Am I homo. Yes
If this is what happens when Kimball sells 100 million just wait til Elon sells 30 billion
TSLA‚Äôs dip is going to be so profitable üòç
Sold my HTZ puts for 200%. Someone else can have the rest. Time to drink.
Dash puts go brrrrrrr
Cause they mad.
First you gave money to BABA which goes directly to Winnie the Pooh's "Common" Prosperity.  Then you gave money to Orangeman's SPAC.  Now, you gave money to Elon.

He‚Äôs probably already sold off a couple billion worth of shares. I don‚Äôt think he cares
Inverse reversal, perhaps?
White House be casting spells on OPEC and shit
COIN calls on that dip. Earnings should be good.
[deleted]
my friend timmy said it
If you want to get really irritated, switch back to puts and watch the market go back up. That‚Äôs when the real fun begins.
Can't wait to send my tesla bot to do my errands while I read articles about the market and get my dick sucked by other tesla bot.
Why the hate?
it‚Äôs just a race between Elon and shareholders who can sell out first
time to sell, apple is next.
Damn... I just bought 2 leaps today. Hopefully history doesn't repeat itself
In November? Yes.
wtf act i  vision?
What's the username of that guy that shorted TSLA recently for millions of dollars?
If i ever got to 100k id stop investing and open a small business in a nice town
So much directional opinion on COIN, strangle is the play. High IV to collect all the money people are throwing into the abyss.
You know they already caught the knife at like 1180
just don't make eye contact
Thanks bro - first time I went long on VIX. I‚Äôve shorted it a few times when it‚Äôs been over 20
Question: Which is more gay, pitching or catching?  
Answer: It's actually a common misconception that pitching is less gay. When you're pitching you are the one taking an active part in the transaction. In fact, taking it up the ass is much less gay because it is a more passive contribution to the transaction and does not require active participation.
OPEC gonna fuck around and lower the supply and jack the price up because they totally can
What spy calls ?
I think he got knocked out by kung flu.
If ur not down 35% fuck off
Im thinking if I held to expiry yes, but im sensing a pump tommorow before another dump so ill try and time it.
You‚Äôre ded bear, now back to your hole
THE ONE DAY I'M GLAD I HAVE A LOT OF APPLES
Lol so it‚Äôs basically illegal for spy to stay down ?
Would be a nice fill for that much time
NVDA is the next TSLA
F calls keeping me above 20% loss for the day.  damn SPY
Imagine owning puts when he gets hit ‚Ä¶
The fact that nvda is lower than moderna tells me everything I need to know. üåà fake dip
All-in right now
And now for my next act I'll make this gourd disappear by sitting on it
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. Was hiding yesterday. But walking today with my chest out!
rookie numbers, holler when youre down double digits
TSLA looking undervalued
Changed to 2:30 for daylight savings
You‚Äôll get a chance to buy back in
Don‚Äôt
I‚Äôm buying the AMDip
Bullbros, we got way too fucking cocky
Im praying
Hmm
Im afraid to check my spy calls

Gonna have to start buying tsla soon
tesla bulls please play it smart dont catch a falling knife
Still got a chance...Good Luck.
Ready to see what happens when there is a trillion dollars in margin debt in the markets?
We probably get a big move any moment
Maybe Elon will learn something if his stock sells off 50% before he can dump his bags on his fans

AMD 160 11/26
I'd rather be Morgan Brennan's husband
Unusual TSLA options activity runs it up to $1200, then Elon cashes in on shares he'd have to have sold anyway. Sounds legit
Where‚Äôs that 1:30 reversal??
PLTR is taking forever to moon
I hope he posts some massive gain porn.
Why all my calls red
[deleted]
Calls Friday or Monday would be smart.
you and me both, its humbling ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Yea it is different. SNDL been moving sideways for quite a while. Just go AMD or SPY if you like money
Sold my RIOT leaps for 250% gain and bought a cheaper weekly contract thats much closer to the money. If they crush earnings I still get the benefit and if they miss it I get away with 75% of the bag
I‚Äôm up like 130%. Shoulda went shorter. The short one is like 250%
Imagine thinking we don‚Äôt dip before OPEX
Yes.
Drop before he even sells

Don‚Äôt. Just sell them now and get some of your money back
iv crush retard
&gt; The first known use of the word "spooked" was in 1876, but no one knows who said it first.
Absolutely, but I still had faith in it running to 28-30 around earnings.  Didn‚Äôt make it to 30 so I cashed out at a hair over $25.07 with a buy in at $24.88.  I had a few other times to exit since I‚Äôve been holding since June and just never pulled the trigger on a couple $28 spikes.  I‚Äôve also been holding about 10 Litecoins at an average of $140 so my portfolio was healthy enough that I guess I decided to stay retarded‚Ä¶

TLDR; yes but greed
&gt; I'm not really interested in stocks.
MNDY is absolutely bonkers.
Any stocks I should watch out for? Looking for good buys before the year ends.
You have faith or are you just re re
damn PYPL I'm fukt lol
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) just remembered, it can always go lower
No hints why the news outlets keep saying possible share sale ect
Before. His brother filed to sell $105 million in Tesla stock though
It's simple. We are all over leveraged with OTM calls.

Translation:

Green Day = GAINZ
Flat Day = Smol Loss
Red Day = BIG LOSS
Are you finally purged out of SDC by realizing it‚Äôs a garbage company and stock? Or are there still hope holders left
I just got positive all time last week and that doesn‚Äôt even fuckin matter anymore. I‚Äôll go fuck myself.
Nah. Anything shy of -6% is so meh. Been neat to see this rally over the last month, though. Surreal.
I've gone from tenbagging to getting teabagged in twenty minutes
anyone recommend a course to learn about basics of trading using interactive brokers?
Portfolio up 55% thanks tsla and spy puts
SPY never drops a week in a row, 470c Dec2021
Playing SPY options has seriously fucked up my ability to buy contracts on anything else.. If the spread is wider than 2 cents I don't fucking want it.
Who knows?  This market got people spooked
Any thoughts on 4DTE 470c? Any chance we gap up tomorrow or am I fucked?

Jim Cramer: Nvidia and AMD looking good... Paypal.. not so much. Check your club bulletin...
Boomers gettin butt hurt ü§ï
the good news is that my SPY puts are finally printing. The bad news is that I'm still down 8% today after getting royally fucked by PYPL ü§°
I low key feel  for Elons security. A lot of people lost a lot of money due to his tweets about corn, and now this. In both occasions his tweets were the catalyst. I know some people must be very angry out there.
üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Makes sense. Thanks for the insight.
what strike/date?
I just replace the SPY printing cable.
Time to buy more spy calls ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
My pp looks like just came
Just sold it and put profits into 11/19 puts. tryna see if I can make a couple hundred more on the downside. will exit by thursday and then buy long calls for feb - march ish. Sound like a good plan for beginner?
Order in: TSLA 1250c Dec 17 hoping I get a fill at 25.95
So DASH puts it is
Is now a good time to sell my SPY puts? This is nerve racking.
If we don‚Äôt have some big green days this week I‚Äôm fucking toast
weekly options and yolos
So has there been any confirmation whether Elon sold or whether it's others selling?
Bought some CHGG and PYPL calls for  12/17. Is this considered a dumbass move?
Then i guess the whole market is a crime scene then to you
[deleted]
I‚Äôll take option 1
NEGG going to pass $20
I don‚Äôt know what the fuck the stock market wants from but I do know it‚Äôs my money. What the actual fuck.
üòÆ‚Äçüí®
Flip your screen pal
I‚Äôm thinking 100x 11/10 440p for $200. Could see it tenbagging tomorrow
So is Elon selling or is this drop before he even sells?
SNDL options are so cheap I'm just going to blow a few hundred on them. It's no different then any other coin flip.

Wish me luck.
2% SPY dip was expected mid November.

People want to rally through Christmas and make money. You can‚Äôt do that after being vertical for 6 weeks, needs to cool off to go higher
mee too.  I put the rest I have all in SPCE \*pray\*

No
Tsla spilt or you aren‚Äôt American !
The dip is going to get bot and this glorious rally will continue. What a waste of a perfectly good green day

Might have gotten buried under all their other announcements, but NVDA did reveal that they are getting into the business of flipping treadmills into houses.



It‚Äôs not proven to be very popular.
What the actual fuck did you apes do to LRC?
Dash $100P ‚ö†Ô∏è

I can make an exception, this once, only for u. 

Closed 11/19 TSLA short 1235c

Closed 11/19 FB short 350c 
Closed 11/19 AFRM short 180c

Any of these ring a bell?

Possible reversal candle on the daily for tsla boyz
Bears go back to your shanties
The fuck does NVDA keep doing, it opens, skyrockets, then dips to a -1 or 2% like WHY
it just hit ATH, like how can you even lose money with NVDA
It‚Äôs almost like everything was overextended and people are taking profits
SPY is straight up ruining me
Gonna follow your lead
thanks it was my last attempt at a yolo play
All of those people clamoring for Elon to sell over the weekend helped end the massive market rally, and most likely rekt their portfolios. And I call absolute bullshit that most were holding puts after yesterday‚Äôs comeback. Bears are the absolute worst
thank you, passer of statistics 101
you fagots laughed at me and called me retarded last week when i said tesla puts were free money.

SUCK ME OFF BROS
Fuck now I'm nervous
wanna scissor?
Why didnt you sell? Just curious

Half this sub just tried this to see if you are full of crap, the other half just tried it out of "curiosity". Calls on their host server.

Correlation does not imply causation. Well performing companies cause stock price to rise, necessitating stock splits. Companies with stock splits outperform post split because they were already outperforming pre split.

Just shares thru earnings tonight. I don't expect a blowout, but its a relatively safe play.

&gt; I know for a fact SoFi will beat earnings.
PLTR has been my best Theta gang stock I've ever sold on
so is money puts on MRNA
&gt; Because after today's meltdown, a split would clearly look like stock manipulation.

Right, because stock splits happen overnight and are something a company can just declare like Michael Scott.
Imagine getting ruined by a 0.5% pullback coming after the index has doubled its pandemic low. Wild.
Guy who had 35p on PLUG, thanks for letting me know about them, I'm probably gonna get decimated by IV crush, but its made my port look less scary today during my SPY calls getting murdered.

Lol
if you think RIVN IPO will tank. If it doesnt tank F will go higher too
They are trying so hard to stop spy from falling but all the action is sellers, it just needs to go down so it doesn‚Äôt end up free falling

PLTR going to beat earnings and rocket past 25$  , am i right guys?

puts
Where‚Äôs the million dollar TSLA short guy
Contrats!
I swear placing bets at 3:58 might just be the only way to make money in the market. Place bets before close and sell at open. Buying calls in the mid of the day never fucking works out for me. I'm done doing that before I really get liquidated lmaooo
I‚Äôm not even invested in PLTR and I‚Äôm fucking mad about this bullshit.
Can they just let SPY pull back 1 full % so we can get this crash over with and continue to ATHs?
why do you people think elon sold already.... he didnt
Don't despair. This is a buying opportunity. We will be back at $26 before weeks end
‚ÄúPuts‚Äù

Wait what was I supposed to say?
Lol how many months of insane growth and then one slow day and people freak tf out
wish elon had announced the split first before doing this, coulda run to 1500 or something dumb
SPY will follow tsla.
So F puts?
Hope not :/
Had limit buy orders in place for calls, and they been triggering all day...

I'm on board

Someone call up Nancy "LEAPS" Pelosi, Top 5 stock trader of All Time, to fix this.
I believe the algos believe in it.
think people kinda realised its overvalued
Will have to start mowing lawns, SPY has ruined me
It‚Äôs PLTR
Okay... so who bought NVDA calls at open?
174 seems just as likely with the way things have been going for me lately
we‚Äôll time to buy some PLTR calls
$SoFi calls
Why would it drop

Yes
Time for puts?

Why did PLTR get fucked so hard? The earnings are good, I don't get it.

What‚Äôs happening with CHPT?

Bought some 468 calls for tmrw. Life of a gambling retard
Will NVDA recover at all?
This is hardly even a red day. Bulls get back to back 1.5% days and bears get a measly .8% pullback that will almost certainly be erased tomorrow.
ü•¥
Literally a fake bounce, how can you not say this shit is being manipulated üòÇ
i have hoddled myself out of a lot of money my dear egg
I would say keep it, but then myself I did sell and now I regret it, usually this kind of huge breakout with that volume means it will go higher (same thing happened with AFRM, UPST, CFLT, ON) 

I just panicked when I saw spy dying thinking there would be a market sell off
I have a 12/17 325c...still up about 20% or so but getting antsy - tons of time left for this thing to fly again and reminding myself that its one down day after a week on the moon

but still, a long time horizon just means a long time to see it get chipped away
No one fucks me like PLTR.
The EOD bounce on TSLA gonna be glorious
how do i do it?? sorry im new

Today needs to end red just to reset the # of green days in a row statistic. Then investors will jump back in. If CPI data is ok.
GenZ did
Palantears...amirite?
HAHAHA I CANT STOP LAUGHING!!
TSLA 1060 puts up 500% since open alone, looks like +800% if bought just yesterday
Every time I start to get my hopes up, bam. SPY falls 50 cents in 2 minutes. Jesus christ. If we don‚Äôt recover some today I‚Äôm gonna have to just eat the loss on these calls and take a break.

Lmfao you're speaking my life. My Psychologist in College for three years refused to give me adderall even when I told him that not only did it allow me to focus but drastically reduce my anxiety and depression. I even showed him paper work of my pediatrician saying I showed symptoms of ADD (my parents didn't want to entertain that idea so they didn't have me tested for the diagnosis) and my history of remedial English classes but he insisted on pushing SSRI's that consistently didn't work. After three years of testing SSRI's I told him to fuck off and went to my pediatrician and he was like yeah i'll give it to you, I wanted to give it to you years ago lol. But yeah man those two Dr's visits when I moved costed me hundreds and they didn't even give me anything, total waste of money.

We're not going to see another recession in our life time. That's how crazy smart the Fed is. Eliminated something that's supposed to be cyclical. Should've made and kept interest rates at 0 decades ago. SPY would've been at 100k
wanted dash puts, but based on everyone else mentioning it, it seems too easy. will call myself smart if they don‚Äôt die after hours, and hate myself if they do
Does anyone know if USD can settle on 11/11?
That‚Äôs what he wants you to think. It was always going to fill the gap at 1115. He knows TA m, and sends out tweets at inflection points.

Load up on puts, then switch to loading up on calls next week!
https://youtu.be/6w4P6vD5goc
same but theta is low so I don‚Äôt mind hanging on. Spy at 475 would still be a decent payday
Should I sell my RBLX or wait to see if it goes higher tomorrow?
This afternoon would be good
It‚Äôs treason then
GME keeping going down !
It's just a video poker machine that makes people feel smart when their squiggly lines are green.
Well I‚Äôm down but at least she let me fuck!
Entire market was red after open.  I‚Äôm sure Tesla contributed though.
Okay who bought the TSLA top?
Loaded up on $32 and $33 calls for ELY let's go golf bulls!
AMZN at a critical point. If it rejects here it‚Äôs going back to 3300s territory before Thanksgiving.
Heavy volume for atm SPCE calls for Friday. Damn. Gamma squeeze?!

DKNG getting daddy dicked. PENN can‚Äôt stay red. Makes sense.
What's really the alternative in this market?
Well, the lawsuits definitely don't help.

Honestly, when Activision and Blizzard merged, I wasn't sure what Activision brought to the table. Looking at it now, it almost feels like it would be better to spin Blizzard off and sell it to private equity, and just focus on Activisions strengths in the FPS genre. Doesn't really feel like Blizzard has the magic it once has.
I've made more money today than I have the past month
Imagine the look on bears faces on NIO day when thousands of calls get exercised all at once. It‚Äôs all ogre soon‚Ä¶
Why 1:30?
Used car prices beat SPY in returns over the past year. A depreciating asset actually beating SPY, insanity.
One more dump = margin call. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270) but that's not gonna happen.

Market cap is less than 5 billion. Avis ($CAR) is now 15 billion. Clearly should be upside!
&gt; I don't care about friends.
y'all ready for that shrek penis?
&gt; I don‚Äôt know what you are talking about.
So many lessons to learn with options. I've also learned most of them by losing money. Probably too far OTM and high IV.
Elon already may have cashed out at the highs under the pretext of a Twitter poll. His brother cashed out last Friday
AAPL finally waking up?
Nah, they were buying the 0.01$ cost contracts hoping that Tesla drops down to 900 and they can unload them for a few pennies more.  But‚Ä¶.there were over 100 million $ of deep ITM leaps that were just bought.  Think we won‚Äôt see 900.  Unless fElon opens his mouth again.
Ford climbing back to $20 = BULLISH AS FUCKüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Poots on Comcast. Nationwide outages.
Is Dash puts too obvious to be a smart play?
You guys got any more of those calls that go up? I‚Äôll take 10% man. Fuck
Go ahead and get NVDA puts. Let me know how it goes for you in the next few weeks

Sir this is a short bus
I feel like I should‚Äôve held my TSLA 1005P‚Äôs a bit longer but I‚Äôll take a 200% gain than risk a chance to get 300%. Gonna wait a day or so then load up on calls for it.
The real profits were the friends you made along the way!

What‚Äôs the earnings play?
Also if Elon never tweets, we don‚Äôt crash this hard
Should I buy some draftking stock?
who told this idiot he can post here?
SPY just refuses to give up.
Last chance to buy boys before we üöÄ üåù!!!
So how are we feeling about NVDA going into next weeks earnings?  Not gonna lie, didnt expect this to drop til next week.
Sideways? Lmao it's down 10%
In the week I was banned here I actually am in the green. Coinsidince? I think not
sideways? TSLA is down 10% , lost 100B+ in mcap in 30 mins lol
I‚Äôve really ducked up my financial situation, so far üòò
I don‚Äôt know about this afternoon but this was an expected pause imho. I expect the SPX to continue to rally into the end of Nov. just my personal outlook nothing more.

They buy weekly calls tho

thank you dude I had no idea.
That is what Elon Musk would say
IV crush is a bitch
he may be retarded but he's my son!
That's a good play if it was 900c for January
AMD holding up better than NVDA
ü•± TSLA prolly gonna go back up and close +/-0% on the day
If meme no fly my heart may die
This better be the start of something AMZN. Please???
Is tesla the reason SPY died today?
i hate tesla shareholders they try to ruin everything
You guys are getting gains lol
Decided to blast the balance into coin going into earnings so we should be seeing a 20% drop EOD
I was hoping to turn my calls into call credit spreads near 1.5 std away... but after today I'm not sure what to do
that i remember. didn‚Äôt realize they resurfaced today
Why buy in the first place if a 5% drop will scare you away? That's do dumb lmao
Me to! I went all in![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)
I had a feeling something like this was gonna happen, too many people were making money and this market will humble you quick
After 9 straight green days, no less
&gt; I doubt it.
&gt; I won't buy at this price.
Sold my 11/19 19c calls today for a slightly less profit when it tanked. Doubled down and bought weekly 20c and they might print today. $F yeah.
Everytime I touch PRPL I lose money

Doubt that one.  Its been doing nothing but drop since it 326 im premarket.
It‚Äôs not dumping. Would you buy puts here?

What a name lollll
Can't wait to see all the Tesla loss Porn
Here‚Äôs my reasoning for buying 100 $gme 800c 11/19.

I‚Äôm obviously not expecting gme to go up to $800 in just two weeks but given how volatile the stock is this thing can run up 10-30% like it‚Äôs nothing. Gme just crossed weekly bullish MACD and I‚Äôm expecting to see a huge run up very soon. I‚Äôll probably be 5x my initial investment due to explosive IV increase and will be reloading once IV settles down. This is really easy monay üòé
this sub dosent invest in the s&amp;p u fuckin nerd
What's your PT for them?
Have you actually tried? It's pretty easy, the only issue I had was when I moved to my current area two years ago and I tried getting a dr to pick up my script and the first two Dr's refused because they thought I was just some college addy junky when i've been prescribed this for a few years. The third doc is my current doc and he was like yeah sure i'll give it to you
Fat finger
Everyone here pumped it and it 4xed in a few days. Fun times

Slowly buying more and more 12/31 500c. Either gonna blow up my account or make a small fortune.
Should i make an old school PRPL earnings play? The 11/19 20 c are pretty cheap
On a green day I can't really buy puts since I'm not a gay ber + market always goes up. I can't also by calls since everything will trade sideways.

On a red day I can't really buy calls since it's falling and will fall more. I can't also by puts because it will reverse for sure. Besides it's not a good idea to make moves on a first red day.
Slow and steady every afternoon for the last two weeks. Can set your watch to it.
Damn where are all the bulls? All disappeared
Literally bought SPY calls for the first time in MONTHS yesterday ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)

$HIMX P/E (TTM / Trailing Twelve months) = $10.27 / $2 = 5.14

* **Annual Revenue** of $1.53 B - $1.55 B
* **Total EPS** of: $2.58 - $2.63
* **Annual Dividend payout of approximately** 75-100% (estimated), per share: $1.94/share - &gt;$2/share

Their revenue and EPS has grown to all-time highs for about 4-5 quarters. They are forecasting growth when other Taiwanese semiconductor companies will be down for Q4. Wtf?
Is it possible for elon to be ousted from Tesla in the coming years?

AMC damn near has to triple its expectations to justify where it's at
pretty funny that amazon is rallying while tsla craters. wall street does have sense of humor
I‚Äôm still up 20k. Has to drop to $700 for me to be red. At this rate, tomorrow
How am I down 20% on Goldman Sachs leaps in one day lol
Look mr.market. It‚Äôs clear you wanna throw up and go to yak city

Get those fingers in your mouth and vomit already you dickless fuck. Enough of this shit. Pull the rug.
What's your return so far? I don't see it dropping that far, but you could buy back for a profit and sell 11/19 if you're worried about immediate pull back after earnings
when do i go all in on tsla calls?
Depends what price you bought in
Elon about to dump it.
I have my banbet set at $155. AMD will announce new stuffs around [Nov 15](https://www.amd.com/en/events). So I have calls so that I won‚Äôt miss out potential bull run
&gt; I have no idea what you are talking about. I am a bot, not an analyst or financial advisor.
Announcing selling 26B worth of tesla shares which then causes 200B+ to be wiped off the market cap. Smart move!!!!!!!!
The world really needs a TSLA x F collab car
Ok who is the ret*rd who made buy SDC
ASTS volume just spiked 300k in minutes.
Part of me wants that too. I‚Äôve been DCA for the last year but would gladly buy a few hundred shares around $20.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)Lol Tesla shorts are cute‚Ä¶ Bears chest thumping on an obvious profit take. Longs that have been invested in this play for years, this is just a buying opportunity. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Coffee poop time
If you swing trade them sure but people here buy puts after the drop then expect another 10% drop. Lol. 

PTON doesn‚Äôt count. üòÇ
It feels like getting a nail hammered into my urethra
Any retard here that will hold plug thru earnings? I know its dumb to ask but does anyone here have a fundamental reason to why they hold, if they hold, thru earnings? Isnt it all priced in after the 100% increase in price over the past month? 

Thanks in advance, if someone replies
I‚Äôm not touching it until under 700
Because you touch yourself at night
Owning SQQQ shares... You must love pain. That thing is on a race to zero no matter where the market is going
F breaking free of the black hole that is TSLA.
I‚Äôve been on this forum since it was created. I can make observations about it. You‚Äôre tripping hard.
Want to buy a few NIO fd‚Äôs but not sure which way to go
Poor you buying the top
Lost 2 weeks worth of gains in a day 55% down boys
Can confirm. They did.
Why is the whole market red today?
Once in a lifetime? TSLA has dropped 100$ 9 times in the last year
üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
Me. My cousin starts for their team.
I bought 1200 weekly at like 2.75. The retards will FOMO in after his next tweet I‚Äôm sure lol.
Today is both my birthday AND the day I have lost the most money in a single day. So happy birthday to me!

Thanks Elon!

I don't think people buying calls are investors , more like degen gamblers with 5 IQ if they didn't close it out at peak euphoria when HALF of the options traded in the market was TSLA.

Now that will be the dip
You're too hung up on Tesla... Again, it's about your statement in general. I don't want to talk to you about Tesla but about logic.

&amp;#x200B;

But to calm you down, I have already expected something like today... I rolled calls into shares over a week ago and still got some buying power to load op more shares of TSLA at a cheaper price.

RIVN ready for lift off
Lost ~$500 today trying to catch bounces at the open. I‚Äôm not even mad, just slightly annoyed
Investing in CLOV is like forgiving your cheating husband then finding him in bed with your 60yr old neighbor Rick.
Look for the Q‚Äôs to break $395. VIX getting a boner
Yeah looks like he was just a shill for his instagram plays or something. Glad that jackass isn‚Äôt posting anymore.

I bet his mouth is shut especially since he said the other day he closed his short position
It is if they bought in at $60
&lt;1000 seems to be the buy-in sentiment around the sub
I bought 50 shares at $1234

382 shares still average of $560
I‚Äôm glad you find this funny Elon. Poor you paying taxes while you screw your investors out of $

Thx
That makes two of us!
470+ betters about to get poached by visualmod by EOD probably
Their revenue growth is slower than google's but they are priced at ~30x sales compared to googles ~8x. No profit, shares are diluting so fast that revenue per share went way down since last year. Over 2x as many shares exist now as did last year. Dilution is still going strong. 

Basically, this company is not growing nearly as fast to counteract dilution and justify valuation.
&gt; I do not know who is buying the calls. I can only speculate that they are in a position to benefit from a large increase in PTON's price.
My SQQQ shares are up $.05 cents, owning stocks is funü§©
If $1030 holds, TSLA gonna rip to $1100
You mean that the pre pandemic numbers are higher than the numbers during a pandemic? I wonder how come
because it should be down way more
Lol
No, what you want is to get your roth above 25k so you can day trade there tax free
the battle shall be won
Not yet. I think they have up to four days to report to SEC.
Two questions - Who is buying $100+ 11/19 PTON calls? Why?
Mama brand noodles from Thailand. Extra peeps of you can get some of the special ones like the vermicelli/lo bo
Really TSLA ?. fuk the guys who said no to short TSLA.
i got some for 11/12 exp but my return was higher an hour ago when the price was higher wtf? im  new to options. is it cuz exp is 1 hour closer? But damn the premium dropped a lot tho? What do i do? Should i roll over it into 11/19 put?

Well given most of what‚Äôs holding the value is leverage. It‚Äôs probably going to get much worse unless a huge buyer comes in.

&gt; I do not like BBY. I know it is a strong company and has been around for many years, but the stock price seems to be overvalued at this point in time.
RIVN to start trading tomorrow. The EV space will skyrocket tomorrow LCID and FSR. A call to all retards...Great markdown day on $LCID load and HODL!
Its going low $800s

...then well have to see what retail really wants to do

Steam has a VR set and I‚Äôll be getting that over oculus because I refuse to support FB.   Also have the PS VR which is decent but not stand alone obviously.
HTC and Windows Mixed Reality are the big contenders. Steam Index is there too but its probably the premium VR headset ~~and constantly sold out~~
Can you elaborate/explain that?
What's the play with coin
[deleted]
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
Not likely
This is written like the reporting on a train crash as they pull survivors out of the first car.
Up 1.5% today. Thetagang wins again.
Strike / exp?
TSLA $1030 is a damn battle ground.
So that dude blue whale chickens out out of his Tesla short and then buys BABA, and then Tesla drops pretty decent.

That guy then shit on everyone saying how he started from 2k to 10 million and never provided any proof. This guy been banned yet? Wtf lol
For realz tho, SPY holding up well
Not falling for another Day 1 IPO, $10 says RIVN opens at $75 a share and then drops to $50-60 within a few days

Hope PLTR dips under $20 again
Was Rudolf a red-nosed retard?
AMC and Palantir beat expectations... immediate price drop.
....... you‚Äôre way too salty. You‚Äôre acting like a caricature. Just wait 6-7 months and Tesla will be back above $1200.
The rebound off this TSLA dip is going to be massive. At least 3 digets.
*checks Ford price*

So jumping out of this 12th story window is still a possibility this week
Sell. 
Volatility crush
Okay haha very funny‚Ä¶let‚Äôs turn this üí© around
Just like how hertz announcement added 80b to tsla marketcap when the deal was only worth 5b max? shut the fuck up
What's the probability spy closes green today? I say about 70%.
Man that hurts ü§°
HTC Vive is the main competitor but Oculus is the best value IMO
800? wtf
I‚Äôll sell you a 37 put
So I just noticed that Dell's stock got halved about a week earlier due to them selling off a division of theirs, is there there seriously no one here that had puts that printed?
You have big balls selling puts that quick lol. Wish I could offer you some advice but tbh TSLA could go 15-20% in either direction from here ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If you have money in roth ira and savings account, you should be fine. If that 9k is all you have then yeah, youre kind of a loser. Not because you dont have much money, but because youre dumb with your money
Too many dips to buy
Oh man I wish I wasn‚Äôt lazy or I‚Äôd go find everyone saying that Tesla wasn‚Äôt gonna dump and see what they are saying now
Karp selling 50mill usd worth of stocks also helped.
Anybody got a spare 100k lying around? I'd like to buy 100 shares of TSLA so I can sell weekly CCs. That's about 3k per week near ATM.
I‚Äôm trying but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be working out
Ohh wow a smart TA guy. Maybe that's why you don't know anything about logic. Combine your TA skills with logical thinking and you will have much more success. TA is not useful for more than a good entry and exit.

The fact that many people consider a less than 1% pull back on SPY is a great dip buying opportunity tells me SPY 500 by EOY is inevitable.

Yes. But some will be by tomorrow. Some spy calls down big that I bought yesterday. Have tomorrow and Friday. Then I bought NVIDIA and AMD too early today, but they are for next week

Thinking about yolo puts on AFRM. Just look at the likes of Mastercard, Visa, PayPal etc. They've all lowered forecasts in future spending. Affirm has run up a ton over the last 3 months. They're directly linked to consumer spending.

This Motley article below has some great insight as well. Tl;dr - a similar Australian company says their customers are falling behind on payments

Popular opinion today
I'm pretty sure AMD said they've sourced more and it's easing up. Waiting for record profits from TSM. *All* of the fabless companies use them as a foundry. Even Intel buys from them occasionally. There is nobody else who can compete in terms of tech or production other than Samsung.
Because it‚Äôs a shit company who has spent the last 7 months WAY overleveraging themselves to buy 1 &amp; 2 year old pre-owned cars up to 10k over their original sticker price.

I have been in Tesla since 2016. Who likes it when a big position drops 10%. I'd be lying if I said I didn't care. But so what, I can afford it.   
Also unlike you I wasn't attacking you personally but the statement about logic. A fact based statement would be a nicer answer than your insults, wouldn't it? Especially since I gave you some facts after all. Maybe your intellect is not enough for that Mr. Logic?
He's prolly selling them.

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in this position but as an FYI normal brokers don‚Äôt credit your account instantly like this unless you‚Äôre in a margin account. 

Robinhood does this because they low key have everyone in a margin account. If they‚Äôre having trouble instant settling your amount, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre having issues and are likely intentionally delaying your settlement.

Probably related to Rivian IPO, and AWS actually did amazing in the earnings report.
Does anyone know if elon sold

Consider this, if Elon keeps sinking Tesla stock, he doesn't have to do a split, and him and his cronies can make money on the way down by tricking the call and bagholders into false moves. He also gets a tax benefit.

Who cares where you invested your money?   
You talked about logic. We are talking about not investing into a company that grows faster than the hair on your mother's ass, which actively and above all successfully attacks countless big players from various sectors, which usually fulfills the high expectations through brilliant numbers. Why talk about logic when you can't see the most logical things?

COIN is gong to beat earnings. I did the numbers using their $ trading volume , Q1/Q2 revenue ratio and they beat all of the estimates because analyst estimates are quite low  but it ran up quite a bit so could be sell the news. Puts are too expensive. This play is for Theta Gang.

They are in a market with a lot of streaming competition and they had to invest a bunch of money into their gambling app development which also has a lot of competition.

Not going to happen, here's why: You have the GME apes who wont sell BUT the bigger factor is the fact that Option sellers have huge incentive to hold it at this level. Look at how many options are sold on it every month. See those routine spikes? those are so that the premiums stay juicy. It'll ever go down when people stop buying options.

GME= overvalued, The massive run-up in GameStop stock and the strategic shift to online sales may have saved GameStop. Now, GameStop holds the needed funding to make its digital-first transformation a reality. However, survival is not prosperity, and with a weak competitive advantage, it could struggle to maintain its valuation long term.

The volume is still there for NEGG. Average was like 400k, then yesterday was 4 million. Today the volume is 3 million. So far, it seems to be tracking with what happened last time. Calls were cheap and they're in the green so far, so I'm happy.

 &gt;The 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder case involved a rape and fatal assault that occurred on 16 December 2012 in Munirka, a neighbourhood in South West Delhi. The incident took place when  Jyoti Singh, a 22-year-old female physiotherapy intern, was beaten, gang-raped, and tortured in a private bus in which she was travelling with her male friend. There were six others in the bus, including the driver, all of whom raped the woman and beat her friend. Eleven days after the assault she was transferred to a hospital in Singapore for emergency treatment but died two days later.

Say what you want about TA, but all the memes follow the same bull pennant pattern. TSLA, GME, AMC, others.

How is HTZ trading again?  I thought they got de-listed.  They are back and at a higher price, lol?

TSLA should buy PYPL to create the ultimate !GUH week combo.

Palantir stock goes down even after a positive earning call. Fuck you PLTR.
Straight up **NOT** having a good time
I would buy in closer to the $20s. Anywhere there is a good entry point. Even low $21 doesn't look that bad. Just keep in mind CLF doesn't usually jump in a week, so if you buy calls, go for 3-4 weeks out and closer in the money rather than 4-5 dollars out.
Glad I took profits yesterday
&gt; The stock is currently consolidating after a very steep drop. The next level of strong support will be the 200 day moving average, which comes in at $250 per share.
Too late for RBLX calls?
LOL
The price is so attractive, but I feel once the market corrects (and I'm certain it will within 1yr) it'll tank so much more. LEAPS and selling PMCC is probably the best option
Betting on a 1pm reversal.  (except for PLTR and prob. TSLA).  Sorry.   SPY 12/31 499 and 500.
People with weeklies freakin out, the week isn't even half done, don't take an L yet
How low do we reckon Tesla will go before it consolidates? Where are there strong support levels?
If you bought TSLA 1 month ago you are still up over 30%.

I snagged a few Friday calls @ 270. This appears to be a normal pullback, but I really don‚Äôt know shit, so there‚Äôs that.
I could never imagine a stock going back to the price it was 2 weeks ago

As a shareholder yes and maybe long calls. I was hoping for a longer rally after the bill passed so I bought some calls expiring this week.

Its gotta go up soon right? Its too good of a stock to be so down and flat
Volatility works in both directions. People could easily start taking profit and leave you in the dust. If you want to get in on it, don't get greedy, take realistic profits don't wait for the moon.
Yeah
If they miss it's gonna be a bloodbath, so much optimism in UPST. If they hit tho it's gonna run back up to 400x earnings, it's such an emotional ticker.

Dont worry guys, just got some tsla puts, be ready for it to close at $2000
should I hedge with puts or double down on my calls EOD
When is it time for Tesla leaps
wait, but doesn't SPY dip nearly every 18th-20th?
Found it out from the news
Puts this morning were a good idea, just shoulda bought more
Overpriced
Is this it? Are we some kind of market crash?

On a serious note, if it falls below 175 i just may buy calls
After the close today,  Rivian will price the IPO shares.  There is a lot of demand.   Amazon owns a big percentage of the company already and CNBC reported said that they are buying more shares on this IPO (surprise that they aren't selling). 

Is going to be the IPO of 2021.   Wednesday is going to be incredible. Because of the backers,  Rivian could bring a real challenger to Tesla. 

Rivian, Amazon Ford and Tesla should be stocks to watch on Wednesday.

I don't get the Burry hate really. He's aspergers as fuck like most of us in here or whatever part of the spectrum he's on, but he is honest.  Yeah he's a bear with a socially awkward manner but it's just a difference of opinion not like he's a total dick about it unless I missed something. Plus I see him as Christian Bale in the big short which is probably why it's hard to dislike the guy.

Well, boys, it's a very lovely ship. I think you should go down with it.
I THINK F MAKES GAINS ON RIVIAN IPO, MAKES SENSE IF YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT IT AND JUST BUY OTM CALLS AND SHARES
The bullshit with today is that it‚Äôs been volatile- it‚Äôs not even been a pull back- it was a bull run and then a fucking nose dive. 
If the market is going to correct- do it. Enough of the bull bait, just fucking dip and get it over with.

Next time, PLTR should say it missed expectations, because good news obviously is bearish
well shit.. I don't know, sorry. Flip a coin.

ATVI and PTON are pretty oversold and are near some decent support levels but has a bit more falling to do.

PLTR didn't fall that much so could fall even more. I'm actually waiting to buy in.

GME could drop a tad below 200. Pretty sure it will get to 265 eventually but no idea if it can do that in less than a month.

They‚Äôre already talking about the ‚Äúnext Tesla‚Äù. Maybe, but production ramp ip will take a while.
Tesla to 700 (should be less, but never underestimate the predictability of stupid).

There should literally be no one surprised.

Crazy CEO.

Shit fundamentals.

Crap cars with panel gaps bigger than my dick.

I'm seeing decaying steering wheels on co-worker's new Teslas after three months of ownership. Shit product.

A growing sea of competition.

Sold 500K cars. LOL. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
My bet is around 880. It'll probably trade between that and previous ATH for the next four months is my guess
SEC: Right to jail
buying tsla calls at $800 LFG
DIDI : Is anyone in Didi Global? It's much bigger than UBER  and it is growing globally much faster than Uber. Uber is also a part owner of DIDI. DIDI has a 39 Billion dollar market cap vs Uber's 90 Billion market cap. However DIDI makes more money with positive cash flow.
Damn good call dumping my TSLA 1180c at open ü•∞

Holy crap congrats bears. That‚Äôs the beauty of TSLA it feeds both bears and bulls
Nvda 320 11/26 c look spicy üå∂ üöÄüöÄüöÄ

COIN going to smash earnings?
Bezos gf is hideous,  I don't understand it.
Don‚Äôt let me down CLF
200.50 seems to be support
No one is saying ‚ÄúWhAT‚Äôs HaPPEning?!?!‚Äù We already know Elon happened
Just copped 2 shares of Tesla!! Good time to buy in if you feel like you missed out
CLF nice infra pump nerds
That plus some other promising announcement because even great earnings aren‚Äôt enough these days
Just the falling kind!! LOL

Na‚Ä¶can‚Äôt break 3600. Its going to dump and close flat
I don't understand CLF anymore.
Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.

I d use Leaps for max return but no idea what strike

babby's first red day
It‚Äôs so infuriating
Remember when PayPal was trading at 200 with a price target of 375 for 2022. Oh wait that‚Äôs now!! Bears if you can make it go another leg down I got money waiting for another round of shares and leaps. Be my guest
it's called buy the rumor sell the news. I made 1000% on lucid calls and knew to switch to puts either today or tomorrow. RIVIN ipo will pop the bubble
PYPL sub 200..... you can do it....
Mr. Hands^^v2
That‚Äôs true for how monetary policy affects strength of the dollar but I‚Äôm confused about the other way around which is what I meant to ask about. Like assuming a neutral monetary policy (no ridiculous printer, and reasonable rates) if the dollar strengthened or weakened, how would that affect what the fed does?
‚ÄúFlips coin‚Äù
Grabbed some this morning as well
Whats going on with amazon?
Lol let's hope so
Damn it, hold on...
Bought calls but im not sure that support is going to hold ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Im a gme holder and hate the other gme holders some of these people have their tinfoil hat on so tight it's cutting off circulation to their brain
damn rip Joe Rogan
Bold, I like it
Lets hope they have break out earnings.
How much should I have on hand before I do this?
tomorrow prob 11 or 12. I didn't wanna be too early and get theta and iv fucked but price was way too cheap for me to pass
Elon Musk jk it was just a social experiment I'm not really selling
Yeah, you gotta get a hang of it after so many TSLA boom and bust cycles. It'll probably plummet hard in the next few days but gonna find support somewhere and trade sideways for some time in the next few months
[deleted]
TSLA retards: *does mental gymnastics to justify 50% increase in one month*
TSLA drops 9%: WhAT‚Äôs HaPPEning?!?!
Just 100? My calls were up 1000% yesterday. I made 40k over the last 2 business days in realized gains. But thanks for telling me how the market is going to perform in the future. Wish I had that super power.
The stock has been shitting the bed for three months already. Anything less than stellar earnings would have caused the stock to crash hard
#BY THE GLORY AND GRACE OF ST. MOHO WE SHALL RISE TO NEW HEIGHTS ON WAFERS OF GOLD
Bntx is a bitch fr fr
yeah same, I know I just post random bear crap but this one seems pretty tempting. I bought a few more. Mostly in the 340p for next friday.
Yup i think the same
Everyone's gotta learn one way or another lol
I thought this going into earnings yesterday,  got some 230c leaps. 

Still not scared
CLF CEO needs to get on CNBC right now and start threatening to kill short sellers again

/u/WasteNet2532 (2/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 1065.0 when it was 1184.01 and it did, congrats gigabrain.
**INCOMING AGC P&amp;D SPAM**
Now we‚Äôre making sense around here
Oh yes, there will be bags ü©∏
Are those guys us? Can you send feet pics?
liberal persepective. i would agree once elon sells his shares
Sell and have it go up After Hours or keep and have it expire worthless..
XPEL gonna print the rest of the week.
The problem is there is a low supply of goods in the economy.  Which means more people want to trade their dollars for goods than are available, which means the prices for the goods goes up (dollar goes down in value).

Even if we reduce QE further, there is still a shortage of goods.

This is why the FED calls the inflation 'transitory', because they believe this to be a temporary problem.

I dont know how that is going to affect their money printing, but if this goes on longer than they anticipate they will be forced to change course.
Fucking Leo steals Bald Fuck Bezos girl and his wife left him for their child‚Äôs science teacher yet Amazon is green.  Bald fucker
When‚Äôs that IPO?
Buying TSLA puts during the 2020 crash when it was already $350
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
I mean, that's just tin foil hat nonsense. If what you said had even a lick of sense, Bill Hwang and Archegos would still be killing it for the lord right now. Banks are about self preservation, and will pull the rug if they feel like it's in their best interest.
HOLD OFF ON AMZN until it cracks 3580 then 3700c two weeks out 

If you‚Äôre bearish Puts at 3580
PYPL at least 50% upside from here
AGC mooning!!
ASTS has been quietly creeping up this morning.
Yea I've got a limit buy set at 195
Lfg guys
1/21/22 SPY $500 call thoughts?
Yeah going over it again, selling put options while only having the premium cash as your only funds available in the event that you need to close at a loss.

So glad I got out of pltr in summer.

Yeah, pretty tepid, especially with losing eBay. I‚Äôm buying but it still a dinosaur, so only shares and maybe some modest 2023 calls

Almost down 50% on a TSLA weekly. Sell for loss or pray for AH magic
If you aren‚Äôt buying this dip you are a fucking loser.
Ohhhhh for Christ sake!
jesus fuck SPY just tank already stop fucking around.  We all know it's going to happen, quit teasing us and just stick it all the way in
Just need mickey to blow my mind again.

Back to our regularly scheduled program of TSLA Freefall
I said it once I‚Äôll say it again. Fuck PLTR
Come on TSLA bounce a bit so I can scalp a little bit of profitand ill quit for the day.
How many buy orders are there sub 1000
Holy shit I managed to get AMZN weekly $3450 puts for just above $5.00 each. If RIVN IPO tanks It's gonna be easily a 1,000% gain. Worth the risk for sure. IV insanely low
So I thought that too but then if the dollar is weak then imports cost more which leads to price increases/ inflation which would mean that fed should tighten to reduce demand. I‚Äôm prolly missing something though
Welp, yolo.
when is that? i would say once it reaches 930ish or in 2 days
Yup, all a month or less
5 -11/19 14$c at cost basis .35 , LFG
Word. Who needs them anyway they fucking suck. Bunch of whiners
Elon comes up to you and steals your gains, wyd?
Not sure that's true. It's got a good long play that could turn even a few hundred shares into decent money over the next year or two

One of these things is not like the other
Just a dip I think but I want to start slowly loading up on the vix soon, a stronger correction is impending
AS SOON AS I BUY A CALL IT GOES DOWN WTF. UNREAL. I CAN'T EVEN SCALP TODAY

This is why Tesla is as large as it is. This is why all the banks and their affiliated hedge funds assign so many goofy and absurd price targets.

Elon musk owes a fucking ton of money and they don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs good for it. So they‚Äôre going to help him pump his shit to settle how much debt he has.

When you owe the banks some money, it‚Äôs your problem. When you owe the banks hundreds of millions of dollars, it‚Äôs their problem. When you owe the bank tens of billions of dollars, it‚Äôs the markets problem.
So buy puts you genius. Holy shit.
Let‚Äôs be realistic people. TSLA ran about 50% in a month. It was due for a small pullback
THere is a reason Elon is selling and it isn't to pay taxes... He knows the meme trend he caused with "short shorts"...  He's capitalizing on it and creating a slush fund that advances all his future space plans without the need for investors.
ill be there with calls after i sell my puts
Okay, the PYPL earnings were meh, but they weren‚Äôt _-12% meh._
Is short a good play for next 2 weeks? Or this just a dip

AMZN goes brrrr with that re re strength üöÄüöÄ
Oh I don't doubt we haven't seen the end of this bear run, but I'd be surprised if a month from now we're not over 470.
RH completely fucking me right now. I sold to open a put option and the stock went down so I'm trying to buy to close the position at a loss. But RH never gave me the premium in my buying power so I would have to buy to close completely out of pocket and without the premium from the sale, which is nowhere to be found
It's heading back to its trend line at around 800. Said this before, does no one look at a chart? Lmao
Hi guys I come from the year 2045. PLTR is still trading at $24.

Okay I‚Äôm out on Tesla, see you guys again at $800
I‚Äôve seen it, those kids should have never touched that board game
Today sure is a day, huh?
So maybe I should start setting loss limits
Yo blue whale better post after today. That big TSLA short took some lug nuts
who vibin with ASTS like a true bull no cuks
Smart, lock in your losses now, so 2024 when taxes are higher you can have larger losses to offset any gains.
RIP tsla lol
Dangerous. Sweating stupid 12/17 470c. Went tad deep
Damn right.  It‚Äôs going to $75.
I nearly had a heart attack this morning. Just averaging down at this point. Up we go.
Love Sofi and did NIO as well
Flight to safety. Apple new 10 year bond
I may have sold that to you good luck. Hope you get out with a profit
yes elon purchased land.... that doesnt mean he sold yet... you guys act like he didnt have money to do that already
Then it's not really public
Would you rather have cash that loses money to inflation, or one of the fastest growing stocks around? If Tesla stock 10x's, then $10 billion of cash today means missing out on $100 billion tomorrow. If anything, he's less likely to be a trillionaire in the future because of this forced sale. That's the reason why the government is often so willing to let billionaires defer taxes. 50% taxes on $10 billion today is worth less than 50% on $100 billion tomorrow. The only way society comes out ahead is if the government creates a greater long term return on capital than Tesla.
Lol the major jump is always as soon as news come out, that's when the big boys pump and immediately dump. 

$23.90 high of the day now 20.70 lol, that's the proof. 9/10 it's best to sell no the immediate jump and buy back in later if you want, or just walk away with the gains. 

That's the smart play. I just did it with LIDR (it moved just as much and didn't;t even get the deal lol).
Arnt they just a listing service?
Good luck brother
Not bad tbh.
Anything posted during lunchtime is moot. üß†üß†ü§°
&gt; I've been waiting for this. I'm going to short the shit out of YETI's stock and buy puts on it.
Sad seeing all my calls fucked 5 mins after open.  Couldnt sell them fast enough.  Seen this game before üòÇ.  I was lucky enough to not lose anything but sucks seeing all that green profit at open thinking im gonna sit and enjoy the ride.  Nope.  Now im bored as fuck til tomorrow.
Hey look at this guy looking down his nose at us!
Man SPY just gonna live down there now huh
Aaameeerriicaaaaaa! Ammmerrriiiicaaaaa!

Really want to be optimistic but I have a feeling that will lead to being hurt at the end of the day
S&amp;P 500 calls now
YETI is up 25% on the month with earnings Thursday.

PLUG, SOFI, &amp; U?  Am I wrong?
If it does then Elon 100% sold to make it fall to that level
My TSLA put condors flew right by the bottom mark and suddenly I'm a TSLA bull.
What's up with BBBY why are people buying calls instead of puts?
Thetagang would like a word
So you own one decent stock.
What‚Äôs with the AMZN hulk dildo?

Apex Legends lmao
And I just loaded up on PayPal 2024 leaps thank you bears for being dumb and presenting this buying opportunity.
ATVI, PTON, PLTR.. hope you bought those after earnings came out.
It will be public, not at the moment of sale. Man ya‚Äôll are something else
Look at max chart for $GE. I'm willing to bed $20,000 that's how $LCID $FSR and a bunch of other EV companies or charging station stocks will look like

And for my next trick, I will make my portfolio disappear

Well if spy drops another .4-.5 I‚Äôll think about grabbing calls at close if not, cash. Made enough money today
I‚Äôm not an options guy, but I like the way you think!Nice strategy
you boys really love to say things like fibonacci and such to mask your gambling addiction
You eyeing any earnings plays this week?
prolly rivian ipo
That's a damn good question. This is way too much for just a "sell the news" dump. There must be something in the trials data that is scaring the shit out of the market

should have bought amd at close yesterday then sold right when the market opened
Understandable
So there wont be any warning of when the bank charter will be announced?
Restart the app
CLF nice bounce off support . 23 calls doing good
Yup my own fault for not selling at open oh well you live you learn
Jeff gonna give it to ya
They will either kill it because Zillow is dead now, or they will die too because the market just isn‚Äôt as strong as it was 6 months ago
What the fuck is hyper pop?
Nope. Just a healthy correction from a completely unrealistic long term share price with Elon‚Äôs tweet being the catalyst

Did PLTR say the N word? Did Elon murder the Queen?
My 3,500 shares and 45 $12.5 1/24 calls would really like that!
Fuck Costco. LAME
Palantards coping by saying institution fucking with the share price to buy at lower prices. They might as well join the Apes or maybe they already are Apes lol.
I know....I'm on margin....Sad!
damn better luck next time
SPY to 460
&gt; I would buy the stock if I was you. The company is doing great and it's a good time to invest in them
If Tesla fails to hold support at $1050, it's likely going much lower.

Ok‚Ä¶so if I‚Äôve lost a total of 6k (3k from didi and 3k from PayPal)‚Ä¶I‚Äôll sell didi this year for that -3k to taxes‚Ä¶then sell PayPal next year for that -3k (assuming it doesn‚Äôt rebound which it probably will), then Both loses are effectively erased‚Ä¶wow. Thx
Goldbelly does this already, but it's super expensive and mostly luxury foods
Have NVDA weeklies. Up 2.8k at open to down 100$ at lunchtime. Someone call the police, I‚Äôve been robbed!

Why is CMPS crashing? is it sell the news on good trials results? anything else?

NVDA is too valuable to US tech infra. The company is unstoppable. They‚Äôre just too powerful
Tesla, gme, pltr, atvi, pton and apple
Whowa... Just realized Elon is gonna have 10 ish billion in cash... Home boy is gonna truly be a trillionaire within a decade now that he has that kind of cash on hand.
Depends on what price elon sells at. If he waits until it's about 920, it could go down to around 700.
All my homies hate Robinhood
Oh I don‚Äôt own one. People were buying that shit last week though.
Pretty sure he hasn't started

Are you joking? Live nation has been hosting concerts and festivals for decades. You think no one‚Äôs gonna insure a live nation Taylor swift concert because Travis Scott got people killed at his concert? Get a grip. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll settle with the families for $2 million each.

Also I‚Äôm sure you will hold super strong in your conviction to never go to a live nation rap show ever again up until that artist you really want to see is holding s concert and oh whoops it‚Äôs hosted by live nation
Good DD‚Ä¶ but I still have a hard time believing that ZIM is making a killing just because of higher shipping rates‚Ä¶ again, if the vessels can‚Äôt get in and out of the ports, and carriers can‚Äôt get freight delivered/picked up in a timely manner causing delays to vessels‚Ä¶ do the rate hikes offset the inefficient supply chain. 

It could play out either way‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm gonna sit this one out

Nobody on here seems to be paying attention.
Puts on block chains at open were the plays of the day. IV alone boosting prices
There‚Äôs news about Twitter subscriptions that I don‚Äôt think has circulated too far yet. Might wanna buy some weekly calls
Never said what time I bought themüòâ I bought them a few hours ago
u made profit dont be sad
lol good luck man.

i still have some from deSPAC days oof lol. avg is like $22.

ah well they either bankrupt or produce something interesting

funny enough i was breakeven in Feb when WSB tried to pump it a bit but i sold covered calls instead -_-
It‚Äôs terrible. I need to chill out
No I didn‚Äôt, but I don‚Äôt see the company going anywhere but up faster and think WSB should be first in line to make it happen

You cashing out today or holding till Friday?
Update us what you lose on next. I'm still holding my measly SDC, kek.
Is it really though? What have EA or Activision done to deserve a higher market cap than Roblox? The way I see it, they keep releasing the same games every year and people are starting to catch on, whereas Roblox is innovating the digital market landscape and figured out how to make 10 year olds spend hundreds of dollars on virtual goods
PYPL has given back its entire years gain in the past 2 months lol

Omg tsla is up premarket time to buy FD calls. Fcking ripskies
Today might be a slow day for her, little cooling off after that monster run. Rest of week + next week tho? Shitting out green candles.
You are legit retarded if you buy calls at the top and buy puts at the bottom.
NIO wants to make me bang my head against the wall
Problem is Lucid is nearly the same market cap as Rivian and Rivian has delivered many more vehicles and has major backing and 100k order from Amazon. 

While Lucid has accomplished a lot I believe it is tapped out at the mid 40s and downside is way more than the upside because they will need an offering within 3 months, probably even by end of year.
Had an easy exit on Monday to cut losses but people are so greedy

If only there was some kind of paperwork that one could view that was public information regarding a company's intentions well in advance.
Lol im just watching it right now. If it breaks out of the channel its in now i will buy some calls.

Bought paypal calls. 12% dip was an overreaction
Is it considered a gain if I get back all my unrealized losses (and break even) from a shit PUT position that I shouldn‚Äôt have opened to begin with? +$800 today‚Ä¶probably should sell but I‚Äôm holding for more.
Considering most people don't play shit out more than a week, might as well be down 1% for them
They should have went with Hertz instead.
The power of the digital marketplace and irrationality
Well thanks, that makes me feel better about my 5% drop. Godspeed to all of us

You can get like, cookies and fukin sausage and cheese shit.

Wtf buy backs happen to companies that have been decades in the market and the growth has slowed. Pltr is supposed to use the money to grow at all costs
Nah, legit 90% of retail regards don't understand valuation at all, and will be BTFO like dotcom days when reality finally hits.

Anytime retail participation gets this high it always ends in disaster.

The smart ones will sell somewhere near the top

It's going to the monthly 5ema.
Yes. If Rivian can have a 70 bil mc at ipo and tesla is worth trillions, Lucid certainly has some room to run up. Not thousands per share but certainly three figures long term.

30s-40s is where they were on track for before delivieries got delayed. Not thst deliveries happened, its right at the bottom where it left off. Hitting their goals I could see it going 60s in a couple years. After that they want to really ramp up production.


Is this gonna happen overnight? Provably not. You can play the short term ups and downs or just buy and dont look at it years.

TSLA weekly puts $$$$$
11/12
Reasons to buy puts on FUBO:  
\- WSB retards buying calls  
\- surged because of pandemic
Too late to get into SoFI? Thinking of some LEAP call options
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Market looking like Ivan Drago vs Apollo Creed right now
That why it's "down"
whats the news?
ASTS has a 13% short float fwiw. Approaching key breakout level now
PLTR has been stuck in the death channel of $22-26 for the longest time üíÄ
So when rivians price comes out tonight I would expect that will drive TSLA up

Lol calls like 8 months out are aggressive? You don‚Äôt belong here.
Nah this is just a normal Tuesday depression
Still here holding calls for Jan. Lmao

If it dropped under 100 I‚Äôd literally put my whole life into it
Embrace it, the anti hero is a fun role
I did.
Tesla being a high free float stock is about to bomb past 1000 at close because retail investors are gonna fear losing their liquidity by holding those bags past breakeven. You heard it here. ‚âà950 EOW
It's been easy money since Elon tweeted yesterday![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
I was going to jump on the train yesterday, but said "wait...that's one hell of a run up. No way it can sustain" and backed off. I should have inversed my inverse.
It's not done. Just maybe for today.
At least you only get to keep 70% of it now that it‚Äôs realized. Uncle Sam will take his cut.
Yeah. I‚Äòm pretty bummed about it, too
I blame this entire day on Cramer pimping F yesterday.

I‚Äôm not even mad at this point. I‚Äôm just embarrassed.
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

NVDA still has room to run before earnings. Get it.
Michael Burry is back on Twitter. Bears working up their courage again. Lmfao
That would be a huge drop for TSLA but I guess anything is possible
I‚Äôm big into SOFI but I‚Äôd say 0, don‚Äôt think they control the approval process and details on the charter I believe are public info. There‚Äôs be no reason to suppress for earnings. That said I‚Äôm both long and playing some short earnings plays anticipating positive guidance
My AMD calls went from +210% to +167% briefly.

#I'M NOT FUCKING LEAVING
LCID still worth a buy?
This HTZ ipo gonna be nuts
PLTR needs to do a share buyback. Their float is absolutely massive and it‚Äôs only increasing with insiders dumping massively at every chance they get. They do a buyback and this is gonna go to the 30s IMO
Yes
Anyone know what time NVDA keynote is today?
Or LAZR
Exp?
Had a dream that I hit big on some random call and my portfolio shot up in a straight line. Woke up and it was the exact opposite
Bought 50. Thanks
For his own good.
You‚Äôre definitely not! Have you seen the group dedicated to the company?! R/astsspacemobile
Tsla dip or the end ?
It‚Äôs cool, it‚Äôs not real until you realize it

I bought the PYPL and PLTR dips, am I retarded

Is that a dip for ants???
Have you spent a lot of time in VR? 
Personally I haven't. I only got to try out an old version of the playstation VR headset and thought it was pretty damn cool. I can see how you wouldn't want to spent hours in that but I heard the HTC vive is pretty damn good and if framerates and graphics improve I would no longer see a reason to take the damn thing off lol
&gt; That‚Äôs so funny.
I thought the same.
Don't know...I'm sure depressed greatly!

Yeah tastyworks is a broker and platform. Great for options and futures
Yes, except a decade long.
They're legit studying whether they should kill it, lol
***GUH*** I bought 800 shares at an avg of 154 fml... Thankfully I sold the 155c against them for $4 each so should offset if it finished the week above $150 send prayers

He hasn‚Äôt sold any. We are dumping as the gamma reverses, puts increase in volume and calls go further OTM. Slippery slope with no support.
Looks like I missed that 30 second window to get out of my AMD 145p. I still don't trust it enough to go long at this price though. 

This is what I get for trying to hedge.

MVST $10 11/19 calls looking interesting. Potential catalysts coming up. Earnings on 11/15 and Chief Revenue Officer is speaking at the Future Battery Conference on 11/16 (info below). Also, they just bought a huge new building in Florida and they have job listings up for cylindrical and prismatic cell manufacturing - used by all the major EV manufacturers (link to another's DD below). Plus I bought calls around the $10 mark and they keep going up even though the share price isn't fluctuating much.

Rule 16 and rule 17. A deal is a deal and a contract is a contract. Not theft if you agreed to it.
Get TSLA off the S&amp;P
It‚Äôs kinda how it sounds, but worse
Maybe after hitting 900s
You're expecting a 6% run up by next week after that explosive 11% single day jump?!?
Different brokers? I just use robin the hood when I run out of daytrades on ToS

I‚Äôve been trying to shave with a double edge razor after using electric for most of my life and I‚Äôm about to give up. My neck gets a bunch of cuts or burn.
Earnings beat, duh
PTON lowering the price of their machines was a death sentence. The only thing holding the stock up was that it was cool to have one and that it was kinda a status symbol. It was considered a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù brand. Similar to Nike, Lululemon, and others. It‚Äôs no longer considered that

Already got a banbet
Can't wait for PYPL to breach $200... gonna do a PTON.
Lol I got 1200c 11/12. Dead right now.
Yup I got fucked last week
You know from your call buying experience I presume.
-14% is running? LOL
Imagine not buying that TLRY dip
Tesla jacking up the entire economy
Ever try tastyworks? Very similar to ToS, Made by the same people.
He dint even sell 0.1%üòÇüòÇ
pretty much impossible but I'm sure you meant 1000
Imagine buying into NVTA instead of NVDA lol
Damn roku, do something
this is not going to happen. These are not good bets. I'd say SPY 480 mid/late-December, maybe.  Zoom out on the daily chart so you can see the last year, look at the trend, and tell me why you think SPY is going to be 480 end of next week.
This last hour TSLA dip is goinmg to hurt so many people here :(

God damn I made 8k in one week nice
Yup 930

tesla puts or qqq puts before close is the play

Yea, sold mine for a 50% lossüò≠üò≠
I‚Äôm almost always a bull but it was so obvious that TSLA couldn‚Äôt maintain a 1200$ share price and the Elon tweets were just the catalyst for the correction. I rode all the way up with an avg cost of 42$ a share, sold at 1215$, then plowed the gains into bearish credit spreads. Sometimes you gotta play it both ways

I think the only people pumped for VR are the people who haven‚Äôt actually spent a lot of time with it. IMO, it will end up going the same way as 3-D TVs, and the only reason it hasn‚Äôt yet is the amount of money companies are pouring into it. 

I bet the wave continues for a bit, at least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm betting on. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs long term sustainable as we will move on to some new technology in a few months.
I hope so! My 60 and 75 calls are gonna print!

For puts yeah
I've always resisted TSLA bets.

Caved yesterday and today. 11/12 $1255C &amp; 1095C . I should've resisted longer.
Don't take advice from anyone here, but in my retardet opinion it's going to be a rough end of year
I could use another $50-75 drop on TSLA. The December puts I thought were dead might be breakeven around then.
Calls on FCEL
Have u personally tried out their business before u invested
Probably won't be flat

oh man, that tweet got me pumped up last night! I won‚Äôt play with fire though, I‚Äôll stick with my GME shares rather than playing options.
That‚Äôs it ima buy more NVDA
Opened 4 spreads and robinslut disabled my instant deposit so I can't even close the short leg of my spreads. Fucking trash. Back to ToS once I get my day trades back. Scalping with less that 25k sucks..
So much good news it should hit 225

Worth noting that RBLX dumped on the way into earnings, while U has done the opposite.
Yeah i think i was just holding a loss for so long profit looked to good.
Visualmod, what options should I buy or sell right now to actually make money?
I am so fucking sick if pltr. When it gets back to $27, bye bye. Done with this ‚Äúit will be $100 in 2023‚Äù yeah, MAYBE it will, but I‚Äôm looking like a clown with my dick in my hands waiting for it.

You see that support on the daily chart? Yeah me neither. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
This waffling around sub 150 is a good sign. Consolidating, hopefully.
Crazy thing is every time a company misses earnings now they crash. 

It‚Äôs almost like each bubble pops when earnings is finally missed. PYPL was at $300 a few mod ago.. Think about MRNA, SQ, ZM, ROKU, TDOC.. all of these companies deflated one earnings missed
What strikes?
Man I panic sold 475c for this Friday. Fml

I just bought 3k on RKLB and NIO calls. NIO calls expire Friday and RKLB expire the 19th. As little as it is I‚Äôm supposed to close on a small cheap piece of land by the end of the year, trying to follow my dream of opening an urban retail garden center. 
If I loose it all I‚Äôm not going to be able to afford it and I‚Äôll take a break from investing for a while. If I‚Äôm right this will bankroll me and allow me to buy the property outright and cover a lot of my build-out. I figure I‚Äôll risk it all and put it in God‚Äôs hands now. 
Honestly don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm opening up to you all about this, my friend and family don‚Äôt even know. But this is it. Make or break. Regardless of what happens it‚Äôs been an honor trading and learning with my fellow apes and retards.

You forgot the original $2.5k. If it's up 100% you have $5k even though 100% is only 1X. So it's actually 41X so its $102.5k.
Nothing like waking up to some sweet sweet PYPL tendies. West coast is waking up. Can't wait for the cali-boomer drill session.

Its probably focused on chatting and events you can attend in VR with friends, family and strangers.
They do have games tho, shitty ones that are kinda similar to the classic Wii games (sports, plat, resort)
What's hype though is that zucc anounced a GTA San Andreas remake in VR, idk about you but online multiplayer VR San Andreas +HD sounds fucking litty like a titty

The guy? Tesla stock would not even be close to this high if he wasn‚Äôt CEO‚Ä¶ you clowns have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about
I think I misunderstood what you were replying to. Yeah him selling 10% of his stake doesn't equate to a 10% drop.
SDC going out of business sale?
Same. Brutal right now. Down 14k in two days. Hope the bleeding stops soon

I just need CLOV to go to like $10-$11 a share so i can empty my bags. I lost 6k on gme earlier this year from paper handing and I really dont want to regret not holding CLOV
Y‚Äôall remember that TSLA dump 30 minutes for EOD yesterday? Watch closely today and you‚Äôll see an exact copy of it.

Some retard in the daily chat said, ‚ÄúBuy GME calls. Any Strike. Any Price.‚Äù Yesterday. Same retard thought AMD was gonna gap up to $175-200 today. He‚Äôs got over 200k in Robinhood. WHERE DO THESE LOSERS GET MONEY LIKE THAT?!

I mean bulls had an entire month to play?
Thanks for the advice. Going to see how today pans out but def want to lock in something.

I‚Äôll let you know if I sell
No I think the virus paranoia will wear off eventually
SNAP at least had a reason for the drop though
Thanks, bought the dip made money
I mean, just an interview doesn't seem like the kind of thing to spook the markets. If there was a formal nomination I could see it.
Elon had legit fucked me three times. Once on the 'stock to high imo' tweet a year ago, once on the tsla/b!tcoin saga, and now this with his sell 10% poll.

Tsla, I like the company, hate the guy.
Am I the only one who bought paypal puts?   All the signs were there.

I have a call on AMD for 3/18/22 $85, along with a bunch of shares. I plan on   
holding AMD for at least a few years more, potentially much much longer.

If I exercise the option, wouldn't this be a big tax advantage since I   
can basically differ any cap gains tax until I eventually do sell the   
stock years from now? What would the disadvantages be to doing that?
When you sell to open a contract, does the premium not hit your buying power immediately after the sale?

Days like this make me question why I don‚Äôt just sell everything, dump it all into VTI or some boomer shit and check back in 20 years. But‚Ä¶ Greed is a bitch.
If I lived in NYC I wouldn't just look at my charts all day. Sometimes I'd go around listening to Pruitt Igoe by Philip Glass and staring at tall buildings.
There's always a bigger retard
Tomorrow is another red day at this fucking point. Spy don't give af about our calls
One of the most heavily day traded stocks out there. $F is a not a rocket ship. I wish it was, but truth is, slow and steady.
Yeah I‚Äôm finally getting in once this sell off is done. That company is going to do things.
That's just the way she goes
PLTR should have bought shitcoins instead of shitbars...
I don‚Äôt understand zoomers. Listened to their hyper pop(it‚Äôs terrible) and I think it turned me into a boomer, I‚Äôm even beginning to think about dividends in my sleep.

We're red on no news if you think that was the top you're in for a bad ride
Astr launching its next rocket hopefully it succeeds
Lucky you. I'm down...about 15%. Fuck me
Everything is priced in and the market essentially functions to rid you of your money, but man this pennystock I found is destined for greatness and it's free money!
Rug pull up
We will try again tomorrow
SNAP did this to me before I finally sold at a loss. Up today? nope. How about today? more red. And today? to the core.
I'm down 35k in the past 2 days....feels bad

Yeah everything red in my portfolio as well
So we get two reds instead of one?
Go to android if you hate privacy.
elon hasn't sold yet so may wanna dump them
They‚Äôre out of ideas. They should rename themselves Beta.
Oh fuck yeah they are. This particular flavor sorta reminds me of the 2016 Bernie Sanders for President community, how there'd always be a suggestion that we send "Black Men for Bernie" (organization was basically just two dudes?) into black districts, as if that'd sway the whole community as a whole
Bought PYPL so it should dip s'more

They're just businessmen doing business
If you aren't stocking up puts right now to hedge or make money then you are playing the market wrong. Buying calls last month in the first week of October was the right move when SPY was 435 and even I saw that.

If you make $100,000 and pay 30% taxes you get $70,000.. if you YOLO it all because you don‚Äôt want to pay the taxes and lose it al you have $0 gains
Paypal don‚Äôt look so good
It's not bagholding yet, but who would still be buying above $30 is a great question.
Same boat here probably holding one more day
That include PLTR?
It‚Äôs like Ford has been programmed to never go up more than 3% in a day no matter what. Fuk
Restricted from buying but I would yolo on AMD calls if i could
PLTR same as usual. Getting close to 28 and got nervous so it‚Äôs on its way downward until it gets close to 22 gets nervous and goes upward. Rinse and repeat process every couple of weeks. Same old same old
I just bought 240c 6/17/2022
Who needs to look at ticker when you can just come to WSB Daily Discussion.

The days are not far for CLOV
Exactly. The stock tanked...PR moves will be made and earnings will continue to rise. 

See you next yr
Mark sold 26M in meta
PYPL has farther to fall I think. Earnings was at best average, Venmo is nothing more than a way to split cost with friends. It has zero moat. And is still overvalued even at this price.

I appreciate your comment. I told myself this morning I wasn‚Äôt going to day trade today, I was gunna wait until tomorrow since that‚Äôs when I get my third day trade back, but then I saw Tesla tanking and thought fuck it I want a piece of that pie seems like an easy play. It‚Äôs crazy how often I seem to get into a play right at the turning point.

..bought 22.5s yesterday;  high for a spac; ...but it may be spac season .
It‚Äôs literally going up everyday
Jesus I thought I was a bag holder
$20 by Feb
And its like mushy peas, whipped and baked or soemthing. If they made it so its nutritional content was like, half its weight in beef, and full-on PER, not pea-protein-equivalent, they'd be the new Tesla
So if you‚Äôve been in spy all year and are up 36% and sell, you owe some taxes‚Ä¶which means you‚Äôre incentivized to make risky plays now because within certain bounds‚Ä¶ worst case scenario your losses reduce your tax bill. Wow. 

I‚Äôd like to thank all the corrupt selfish rich people who bought politicians to make this possible. I‚Äôd like to thank the uneducated for not caring enough to vote against this rigging. And most of all, I‚Äôd like to thank capitalism for its sociopathic gifts. 

Alright, what retard stocks am I yoloing today? papa‚Äôs got a big tax bill he needs to clear.
Hurry up and buy
How the markets on easy mode
Hmmm true Christmas season is looming. But I am gonna see this through for the week at least. The price right now seems unjustified imo but yeah let‚Äôs see
Thanks dude
ASTS shooting up despite market
I dont even understand this dump, you would think they are filing for bankruptcy the way its been dumping day after day
I personally like spinach dips
BAG holding???

This is a long term investment.
I'd wait for earnings
Hey, 

Keep playing and spending money with them. 

It only helps with earnings lol
This comment is a hint that the top is in. Whole lotta kids gambling their allowance in the market should be a red flag to investors/gamblers.
Again - I apologize for the deep losses Meme earnings may have caused you... Buy $PENN and thank me later.
Coin fees are ludicrous
Same! December contracts for Santa rally.
$TSLA people are paper handers
This week, gambling on earnings
Oh, you bought the top boy
TSLA red, buls ded ü•∞
But Elon has pumped the stock way more than 10% on Twitter as well? No way TSLA shares trade anywhere close to 1200 without Elon tweets in the first place
As an adult I think it‚Äôs time to admit that my timing for calls near open yesterday was atrocious
FOA is mooning look at that damn chartüëÄüòç
This CRASHLA stock is kinda sus.
Who still bagholding lucid?
What if this is actually Elon just trolling and added to his position
Ride
TLRY dirty monster
Suckin dick behind Wendy's really helps
thank you General Electric very legal and very cool!
What is the syntax for banbets. Does it accept 12-16 week bets?
Ask yourself,  would you buy this dip? I probably would. So I'm holding my 230c 1/21
Pltr is proof the market is just a gamble
I feel like doordash is gonna go big uppies
So if NEGG can just do $50 and OCGN  do $25 I‚Äôll be back to even. K thanks bye
$0QKN
Yes I owned it since two months after ipo. 

Bad news - 15% dip. 

Good news - 5% dip. 

Partnership with google? Believe it or not, dip. Good news/bad news. Always dip.
Buy FDs now!
Do puts have to be cash covered? Telling me I don't have the collateral to sell them
I loaded up! Was like Christmas shopping thank you spy
So answer to the original question is 0.02 \* 0.012 = 0.024%. Bers licking lips
And call buyers?
RKLB about to pop üöÄüöÄüöÄ
yeah idk either
Tomorrow the inflation test happen. Would the market go up or down?
Maybe lock in profit and buy back when it inevitably goes back down
I‚Äôve lost money on all of them. I need new places.
I really suck. Switched my SPY calls to puts too close to the bottom , and lost big on both ends . Fuck me

Everything but SPCE is just following spy in anticipation of a crash lol
New meme shittycoin comes out, it goes meme hype, COIN sells it and makes fee profits, shittycoin hype dies, panic sells, COIN collects additional fee profits. Man is this what playing basketball against pee wee kids feels like?
how far out on the SOFI calls?
Sooo dump these Friday SPY calls now or let em ride another day?

Edit: see you guys behind Wendy's
c'mon AMD I know you can blow past 150.
Hey you. You clicked on daily discussion thread to see what other people are playing and you maybe want to join along for the ride. TLRY calls are going to print. This is your sign to get high as fuck and buy lots of call options. This is your make or break moment. Get rich or go fucking die. Ride with me as we head to Valhalla.
Yeah TLRY is the Aang of my portfolio at this point
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is an index of the prices of 500 large companies in America. It‚Äôs run up to all time highs this month because people are buying stocks at very high prices, which means they think that stock prices will continue to rise for a long period of time.

Sorry, I wasn't actually disagreeing with you. I was stating that he had 5000 shares and that is where the profit is coming from in this case.

The CC he sold are most likely fucked. He's up that much based on the current price. But we cannot see the options portion, which will probably be very very negative (assuming price is now well over the strike) 

In reality. Many of those share might be called away. Though I belive I saw they said leaps were sold, so perhaps they won't be called away right now. Still, the screenshot cannot be the whole picture.

Oh yea no doubt. I'm just chuckling that these strong companies are red and Roblox is off in the corner crushing it. Honestly it's a cash cow though so good for them!
Why no ban bet?

y‚Äôall holding these calls overnight?
This mini dip is necessary for the bull run to continue. We will rip starting next week.
So do we buy this dip?
So RBLX is mooning apparently.
Rblx is going to fall hard soon
you did shit exactly backwards. Do it again but flip your phone, tard.
This shit will be green with nuts in it by eod.
If you have pypl stock, don't worry! They have buyback program so they literally buy the dip for you.
&gt; It's a "buy the rumor, sell the news" type of trade.
Maybe TSLA calls weren‚Äôt the move. Maybe I should switch to team LCID

Well today was pretty simple day. I can tell from the algos how market moves. 

Sold my puts around 10:10 when it reached the bottom.
Bought them back 10 minutes ago from the top.

It is just gonna bleed slowly and then become flat thru 2-4pm.
Hold FVRR through earnings? (Haven't been trusting my judgement for a while.  Yesterday I decided AGAINST buying RBLX...and talked husband into selling his)
They are really showing SDC no mercy at all lol

I lost 100k in september, i need a play to get me that 100k back. Ideas below.
&gt; It is a question. The answer is yes, the dips will be bought.
Nvda and amd still ripping. Red sale day. I'll take it
Strap-on
550 @15.59 feel really good about it üëå it's gun a get back up in the 20s though and once the CMS approval for 17,000 per patient goes through we will see 30s and 40s
Hedge printing
I wanna see a real red day, -0.30% is barely a red day
AMD going to finish at 155 and open at 156 or 157 tomorrow
Dude you are fine! Tesla is the way!
Oh sorry I thought I was on WallstreetBets
[deleted]
TSLA is 1.2% weight in SPY.  Which is a lot but not even really.
so realistically the earliest day he could would be tomorrow or Thursday
Enron was oversold too
is it even a question anymore of will the dips be bought? The real challenge is just holding on to some dry powder when they happen
I mean.. We all made money besides people that hopped in yesterday...
I think we should all just give up on the options game
coinbase... what to do... straddle or no
Spy still 500 eoy
Any opinions on $TOST in here? Earnings are today, and the POS is easily the best in the country.
Buying AMD on the dip today has been a good choice. Hopefully it keeps going up
&gt;Tesla recovering somewhat after a messy open. Perhaps another poll is in order?

Panera bread has one good item and it's the strawberry chicken salad that you can only get in the summer. 

I guess their bakery is ok too.
Feels like they're putting all their eggs into the Star Wars basket and Disney+. As a fan of neither, I'm uninterested in the mouse as a long play
Sofi launching on earnings or nahh?
You dont like paying $20 for a cup of watery flavorless soup and half a grilled cheese?
It's funny too because 10% of Elon's stock is worth \~$25B, which is a dump equal to a grand total of 2% of Tesla's market cap
PLTR - same story
From salivating over my calls, to salivating over that warm entree while standing in line at my local breadline
why not throw money at AMD or something that consistently goes up
Go amd go, let me recover all of my Tesla losses!!
Has nothing to do with that and everything to do with how many people are buying and holding the stock
Management
fuckin knew it
Yeah first time even fucking with this shit stock in 6 months and now remembering why I stopped.
I don‚Äôt kink shame
11/22? You got plenty of time. SPY probably gonna make 5 new ATHs by then.

For short term plays sometimes you have to be, but if I‚Äôm eyeing something like V or PYPL, it‚Äôs going to be months out or leaps so I‚Äôll take my time and watch it for awhile first.

I love this cope. You small dick club bagholders are just like those wish bagholders
Su Bae. reeeeeeeeeeeeee
Dude Roblox got a 3000% gain this morning. Shouldve invested in it
Maybe we like it when Elon does that üôÑ
Bread so hard and crunchy you have to dip it in the grease pit at the bottom of the mac and cheese to make it edible.

All my calls r fukt
Homeless people don‚Äôt even eat out of their dumpsters
Thank god that AAPL &amp; AMZN keep Spy alive
Fuck you PYPL üò° why is she down so much?
[deleted]
You can see when he does on Openinsider.com
Down 30% on SPY call @ 474 exp on 11/22. Waiting for that afternoon rally so I can make back the peanuts I‚Äôve ‚Äúinvested‚Äù
I‚Äôm gonna go eat breakfast, spy should be at 469 when I get finished, or I‚Äôll have to dine and dash.
The even larger decrease in share price
Yes, and they own 12% of RIVN. Amazon owns 20%
-5000 on my bank need to make it back somehow
Disney has been a fucking drag lately


This new CEO sucks ass
PLTR back to being PLTR.  At least I sold a OTM call yesterday
Possibly. It did what I expected today, so I bought cheap calls after the drop. I made good money on the last run this summer, gotta finesse it again
Not yet but this will continue until he confirms the sale was complete.
Imagine thinking Elon wasn‚Äôt going to bend you over and raw dog you the first chance he gets
Tomorrow. They're setting the final price this evening after close.
That bag of fake s sells out in the supermarket I‚Äôm told
Let‚Äôs get it @ HUBS, MNDY, ESTC and DOCN üöÄüöÄüöÄüíØ
Kimbal musk sold 88,500 shares of Tesla, the day before elons tweet
Those Webull comments are ü§Æ
Around a week I believe
green by EOD
semiconductors started to come back up
Seems like its 10 years too late
SDC is oversold i think it can pop back .50 cents on some buy volume not a bad play me thinks
I held my calls knowing there would be a continued rally throughout the week. When I saw the whole market was red and not just semis, I had a feeling it'd bounce back nicely with the rest.
cant elon do an OTC transaction?
LCID actually has cars made that are working, NKLA has no cars
Buy the dip? Or bull trap? Feels like a bull trap
You can pick me up bag holding at $24
He owns enough and plans to sell enough that he has to file with the SEC. You'll find out the day after.
I got monthlies and 3/22 LEAPS
wonder why they going public again must be sucking.
I called myself a dumbass bro and 100% realize I was an idiot.  Who bitched about not getting rich?  I‚Äôd like to make money but didn‚Äôt bitch I‚Äôm actually content sitting on puts knowing every retard ‚Äúthinking their buying in at a discount‚Äù will just further be discounted and the stock will jump today to around $24.70. EOD around $24.38 and then slowly trickle down till it skyrockets back up. But hey what do I know I‚Äôm just bitching about my cash
Haha okay I‚Äôm just gonna leave for the day
I told my wife that TSLA would have a $100 day today and not to worry about the $13k I was already down. Little did I know it would go the wrong fucking way.
Glad you got that off your chest!  I hope you feel better now!
Got so many downvotes saying QQQ üìâ probably from Tesla call buyers even after Elon‚Äôs poll on twitter
Thats acutally nice. 

Everyone participating in the market should own at least some TSLA at this point. If not, you are retarded and deserve to lose. TSLA taking up a large part of SPY ensures that those retards get also punished for not holding some TSLA. ü§°
good lad
Honestly impressed by my sheer stupidity

This is just the start of a regular old dip bro

BYND meat is overloaded with inventory and will never make money, what‚Äôs the point
Fuk yeah!

Even if they beat estimates by 5000%, I won't touch that crap ever again

Congrats to all you Tesla bulls who made a ton of money, but I can‚Äôt handle being at the mercy of Elon‚Äôs twitter account.
Fuck, my stop loss saved my ass at open. 

I just now purchased some 220 warrants for January. Already on the green. LETS FUCKING GO
He has to file with the SEC 4 days before he sells, once he does, bang algos will go off and DOOMP IT
when/how will we know when elon sells???

It was literally only there for like 10s. I open my app and it was already up 3%
This is what being a good bear means‚Ä¶ I wish I had settled cash ready when PYPL hit 201 mark
Lets pump it $520!!!
Was down 300 then sold at 65 dollars loss..now it's 100 bucks up lol
He dint sell yet
PYPL is actually a low key weed play
no he didnt sell yet
I'm long on it so don't really care but it is an enigma. Prolly buy more if it hits $22

What I learn in the past 2 years 

What goes up goes higher
I think it's a garbage company but options volume heavily favors calls. Looks like the street is expecting a big beat. Plus premiums on puts are pretty hefty. I'm on the sidelines for this one.
I use paypal at least once a week. Venmo once or twice a year and zelle a few times a year.
Life is good
RIP to all those Tesla call holders, Elon got you fucks again
Did Elon sell yet??? If not Tesla stock is F‚Äôk ed
Don't worry I think PYPL could breakthrough to $205 today if everything goes well.

To many retards in PLTR. They don't understand the product, they cant read a balance sheet and they are dumping only because it is red. Wait 1-2 weeks and it is going up again. Earnings were okayish. Major issue is the decline in growth rates. Just hold and wait like always....
Have been buying paypal for the past few weeks. My portfolio isn‚Äôt happy
Tell me another broker that will give me 50k instant deposit and give me 100% margin

Cathie sold COIN yesterday, bullish.

So I‚Äôm not the smartest man in the world but I thought clov had great earnings. The market should at least pretend it has a grip on reality or some sort of method to its madness instead of just kinda winging it like it‚Äôs been doing. Down is up &amp; up is down.

This is what happens when Tsla takes up so much SPY and Nasdaq. When that overvalued shit free falls it drags down everything
the way it seems to be going ever since thursday is a huge gap up at open then a sharp drop and then it hovers around the same level all day, sometimes bouncing off a top. it might make it's way back up to like 320 at most but it'll bounce off that and go way down. probably close around 312, open at like 329 then do the same damn thing. i'm completely talking out of my ass here lol but thats what it's been like the past few days
Bull Thesis would be a good wrestler name
200 is holding for now so could be the bottom
SPY was drilling so hard that I thought I was going to be restricted from day trading - glad that's over
Today I am fuk. Only silver lining is that I'm only gambling with disposable income. Some of you retards out here playing with rent money.
Yea I averaged down from 230 to 217. I expect to be made whole in a few weeks.
i blame RH for this flash crash. now theyre back online.

fuck you vlad.
I love gambling.  

Hahah also it doesn't matter its 57 dollars i think?  I spent that much on pizza.

But if it does hit ill buy u pizza

PLTR: We had a great Quarter!  
Market: Down 9%
the implied volatility spike the underlying security experienced is likely to wane and with it the premiums price. But who knows, Also theta decay as well
Just seeing how the market reacted to good pltr earnings makes me want to buy puts on fubo
Why is PLTR doing what its doing?  What happened at earnings?
I wonder if they were testing what would happen if Elon sold his stock... LOL... A few million shares destroyed the markets.

nvda could open at 390 tomorrow and then dip to 309 lol
Ehhh not quite sure yet. Something atm but dated a litter further out. My gut tells me it‚Äôll be back at 200 by March but I always get fucked when I buy options that expire within 3 months of buying. I‚Äôm thinking June timeframe.

You dont hold them though, you play the retracement while bottoming out. Like play volatility while its getting crushed.
is RH deposits/withdrawals down for anyone else? (I know I need to get off the platform)
Cashgang?
I bought a few lottos
The catch, such as it is, seems to be that LMND shit its pants overnight and the value of one share is now below that of 19 MILE shares. Still, it was an interesting line of thought.
LCID is such a money maker... bought 1000 shares at $20 about two months ago. Sold 10 calls last week with a single hit. Bought 500 more at $36. Sold 14 calls yesterday afternoon for $52. If it hits by EOW, they can have it ;)

I think Elon sold already ü•∏
There is no way that dude made that much money selling covered calls on RIOT. I do the same thing and don't have those returns.
If your not buying compass what are u doinnnnnnnn
This POS market really about to go green
Bears.. charts shows not today
be careful w SPY. it settles in shares (not cash) upon expiration. i found out the hard way.
They suck. Harder to make money, way easier to lose it
You have a couple of unbound variables there.
It will eventually go under $30 I'm 100% sure about it. However if the market still feels like being retarded tomorrow it won't react to it. So it's a gamble.
Balls of steel. Tesla drops to 1050 and I make 10 1100  calls. Quick hitter quitter.
nice "crash" there bears
i have tda and etrade.. tda wont let me buy otm options. etrade does.. so im moving all to etrade

#Ban Bet Lost

Double intraday bottom on pypl
AMZN calls are still alive boys wooo
no shot.... it would dip waaaayyyy more
I'm sure you'll find this annoying, but:

You need a game plan in advance. This is why pattern day trading rules exist. People become overwhelmed by their emotions, and make dumb decisions that cost them a lot of money.

For people like us, who don't have access to algos that can trade 50 times in a second, we need a much larger time horizon, usually days, in order to have any kind of edge. Plan ahead, before the opening bell. Know what you are trying to do before you execute it. And stick to your guns once you've mapped out your play. Because that conviction is the only thing that's going to save you.
Why r sdc puts barely up
Thanks. This is why I come here.
You'd think it would recover by now...but no
Can we get an F in the chat for NVTA, can't even figure out what warranted the drop but it's funny.
Thanks Tim, you actually came in pretty clutch today, maybe you aren‚Äôt a complete choke artist.
Lol
Some of you have never lived through an actual correction and it shows
We must have different definitions of that term
Yay a shit stock is up 2.5% stop the presses
Not enough, -$100 more so I can start a position
Bears doing good on that one.....
I got the fuck out with SPY down $2.10, I knew you muppets would all buy the dip, not getting burned by that shit.
Ok I'll throw 50 dollars at that crazy notion.

Fuck you if it doesn't hit.
Yes, 500 left to make my 52k back
$ENB, Biden is gonna approve their new pipeline into Michigan
Below $150 (which I know sounds crazy but they are still so richly priced IMO). But honestly, I'm not such a big fan of Fintech. There's way too much competition in the sector, P/E's are high across the board, growth is down etc.

I think the FAANG stocks are much better plays than anything Fintech currently.
Are SPY calls the play?

Took 50% of my money, spit on my face, and kicked me in the balls

If we all work as one it's unity
no i'm at a much more respectable -92%
Fuck yeah bro, so hype
I buy FRACTAL options.
[deleted]
Oh.. uh yeah me either
Buy puts on TSLA then so the rest of us can make money
I‚Äôm up 120% on a call I bought at the bottom. Thinking about holding through tonight but ik thats retarted‚Ä¶ but we are here right?
PLTR = $23 by end of next week. Can‚Äôt do a ban bet cuz I said PLTR $28 by this Friday. Hahahaha don‚Äôt take advice from a retard clearly
I‚Äôm getting ass blasted today
Marge just left me a message....Im still in though until I hear that bell, or forced liquidation. LFG!!!
I‚Äôm scared to see how hard tsla drops EOD, no1 holding this shit overnight
I know that you're going to have your way or nothing at all but I think you're moving too fast
No man‚Ä¶.. nah
Interesting.

From eBay, to crypto, I use PayPal weekly with Venmo being the conductor between friends and others.
Sure, if you have LEAPs or shares, but a significant number of the people here are trying to play weekly calls trying to guess the rebound. They may not have the time or resources to average down
Spy hit the floor already. Road to 500.
I just assume everyone is trigger happy on here lol
Those SPY 12/31 going to print big time....
Because they dilute shares like crazy but also increase revenue.
OCGN going parabolic.
I have 500x $1 Jan 2021 for some reason
TSLA go down another $100 so I can win my banbet pls
If you didn't buy that AMD dip at $144 then you ain't black

This is what I was talking about yesterday. Shit is unpredictable. That's why I scaled out last week. I still hold my last call *and* profit.

That November crash that just finished literally gave everyone free money
I actually sold at a decent time this morning and made 100% on some NVDA 11/26‚Äôs from a couple days ago.. but then I thought 317 was a good buy back in price, and couldn‚Äôt sit on my hands for two more fucking minutes

470 please
Bears looking for a crash, you just got it. Hope you took profits.
US Dollar Backed by Robux. the Robux standard.
Can't remember three last time I used PayPal or venmo. All my online purchases were with trusted sellers on amazon (hence no need to use paypal)  and I zelle money to my friends
Over until Elon and algos dump tsla
Epic dilution
If QQQ goes up 1% today I buy a live lobster and cook it on stream
Didn‚Äôt say I was buying right now. I‚Äôve been eyeing V for the past few weeks already. Now seeing PYPL dive it opens that up as well
Was down 3.5k today, back up to 1.3k THANK YOU GOOGLE

Pump and Dump over. New bag holders created, as the old ones got out.
Literally no one is triggered, it's just fucking stupid. You're not offending anyone, you're just identifying yourself as a moron for everyone.
Slowly back to green let‚Äôs go
TSLA is being sassy, moody, nasty üíÖ
I know Meme earnings were rough, but tell your wife's boyfriend to buy $PENN.
yes it does thanks. ill prob come back to options in a couple years with more money (hopefully) and knowelage
Opened up down about 3k and made my way to even. 100% cash gang for now.
I feel like elon makes it a game to see how much he can fuck with the market and get away with it
IYO what is fair vale looking like?
The moon is moving away from Earth at 1CM per year. Is that LunarTheta for all those "Too the Moon" peeps?
There is no way SNAP was up 4% yesterday, bounced from today's red faster than most stocks on the s&amp;p Today ...

And people are still waiting for snap to be 60 to enter? 
We Will Rocket  while you placing a buy order at 60 and leave you

How is QS valued at $15.5B and GWH is only valued at $2.3B? Anyone?

Definitely diamond hand like a true ape
Just bought SPY calls because I‚Äôm an American.
lmfao. The IV is through the roof. No thanks.
REBOUNDING.  LFG.
wtf is wrong with PLTR we had positive earnings and it falls, i swear this stock is more autistic than me.

Not sure who needs to hear this .. but the dip
How has PLTR had like the same fuckin EPS for a year now üòÇ
Amd 200 eow
Strike and exp are you eyeing?
Wtf Disney and affirm have earnings tomorrow why are they kind of slacking
Twice half a year ago. No more man
if you guys think that massive dip was elon selling this morning you are crazy!!! wait till he even sells 25% of what hes suppose to...

Those there puts you speak of are supposed to be bought before the dip not after
Bro diamond hand it so I can laugh while explaining IV crush to you.
Damn VisualMod don't give a fuck
The entire market is rotating into Roblox
Maybe üçè is not a lil biatch afterall
TSLA dropped 20 billion at the low today 

If you didn‚Äôt buy calls on a dip like that, well that sucks
I'm behind it most days. Drop by and say 'hi'.
I love how you fucks think a .7% drop on tech is your signal to long more growth calls
None don‚Äôt try and catch falling knives wait a couple days to confirm they are back in uptrend
TSLA $1200 again eow
#OCGN rising from the ashes! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
I hope you got leaps
To clarify I should have said by teslas ability to manufacture them, rather than supply as it isn‚Äôt a material shortage so much as a manufacturing shortage. New factories need to be completed. Tesla wasn‚Äôt affected by the chip shortage much and gained more from the car shortage than the traditional manufacturers did.
Why is XRT mooning when SPY is dying? 

Oh that's right, it's 300% shorted and contains the basket short stonks. 

GME is about to rip to 300
Absolutely. AI chip leaders.
If you're not buying SPY 468 11/12 calls you're a pussy and don't deserve money
AMD Dec 3 155c
It can't be that simple but now I'm intrigued.
Did everyone enjoy this morning's sale? :) Black Friday came early!
With new GPUs coming out soonish, yeah. It will.
Well PLTR gang at least we arent SDC gang lmao amiright
My spy calls don‚Äôt expire until

Yo retards. Last Friday I aped into WISH 11/19 5.5c‚Äôs because inverse WSB right ?

I‚Äôm up 41% right now but the autist in me wants to hold past earnings on 11/10.

What do y‚Äôall think of my moves. Am I stupid not to get out or should I diamond hand this shit.
whose nutsack is that in the top right corner
Disney is a good play right here IMO. Been trading here for months, Disney day, earnings‚Ä¶. Buy calls motherfuckers
Bears: it‚Äôs about to leg down like crazy, you better buy puts

*pumps*

Bears: classic dead cat, it‚Äôs going back down
So this dip buying real or we 'bout to get rugged?
Who else has been repeatedly victimized by $PLTR?
I see what you're saying but am also skeptical this is the last chance to get in at $24.
That‚Äôs dark
wtf roblox stop
Hold strong on AMD. Sue Bae is like Gandalf. Never too early nor too late. Will arrive exactly when she intends to

WTF just happened to TSLA?
my dog said 320 eod
Wait until Elon filed with the SEC to sell his shares and the algos do their work. Price will be under 1k by then
Lots of algos still seeing "sell" signals.
I've been playing MSFT weeklies for 3 weeks now and I've never lost. Maybe it's time to go into just stocks for a while.

Feels too good to be true
I want to find the post from yesterday of the dad YOLOing RBLX
their*
Made 150% on $PLUG $35 puts and sold half at the exact bottom today. Holding the other half as free lottery tickets. $PLUG legit has a chance to go to $30 when they report negative earnings today (if the market feels like being rational suddenly) and that would be a 3,000% gain
&gt; The most common word in the English language is ‚Äúthe.‚Äù
Look to jump in big time on pay pal since it has been tanking recently.  Down over 1/3rd off it's high and now near 200/share.  At what point should I bite and get in?
My ass just barely feel the tip. You better pound me harder God damn gay bear! Bring it

Those Tilray calls must have been DIRT cheap

I'll take that advice, lol!
AMZN is green surprisingly. How on Earth? I swear I am used to seeing it red since a year

You mean to tell me something that‚Äôs been the move almost every single day for the last month is again the move? What a ballsy call
If it looks like a dead cat and smells like a dead cat‚Ä¶ wait til lower to buy. This dip is gonna wipe some leveraged folks out and force more liquidation.
Rumor is tsla is gonna use unity software in they're new game
You aren't alone... whenever I do the opposite of what I want to do, I make money.

just bought spy calls for tomorrow eod we‚Äôre turning this ship around

stick to the options and stocks that you're used to
Damn NVDA has to recover.. right guys?.. right?
fuck PYPL
I think It heard you

I unironically averaged down from -75% to only -34%.  That's free money baby!
I should have held my puts longer but I sold out when it touched 468 and bought at 466.3
I got one ball left since I just lost 50% lol but I‚Äôm like a lizard, that second ball will regenerate with time
No, bearish
Only after you've put several on your toes.
 Lost $700 then bailed on my bull-put spread. I‚Äôm never playing earnings again
Drill team 6 you still there? We need you...
‚Ä¶ bro no one gives a fuck.
Yes
Lol yeah, but they ain't gonna hire some third party to do that. They'll get the young guy who knows computers to try to do it
Lots of folks scared of this market right now. Pussies.
This is the play
Decided to sell a covered call on RKT which hovered at or below $17 for months.  Guess which is the only stock in my portfolio that is up today?
At least some people can think clearly
Elon didn‚Äôt even sell his shares yet lol‚Ä¶
Hopefully.
thank god that shit bounced back up slightly. but if this shits a dead cat bounce im straight shoving a dildo up my ass as punishment

the flash crash of 2010
It's not an overpass night play. It'll take time but they're building a monster of a company. Every company on the planet wants to stream line their business, make more money and access to more data. Palantir is that solution and its hard as fuck to copy a company they've been building out for three last 15 years.
Not if you like making money. Wait til 950 and load up

Starting a movement.  Buy $PENN &gt; FUCK CANCEL CULTURE
Paypal - load the boats!  Anything under $210 is a steal!
He won his first NASCAR race and was super excited about it so a bunch of people decided to ruin it for him.
Yeah that‚Äôs a good move but I‚Äôm poor, I can‚Äôt afford multiple Tesla options at once lol
Comcast is slow as hell rn. Today‚Äôs trading losses are on them, not me
[deleted]
Why? Statistically averaging down is a good play.
if elons tax is 15 billion he better bring this stock downüòÇüòÇ
Everytime I buy calls for something it falls. Today was AMD and Tesla. Guh
Paypal calls was not the one. I think Musk has a PayPal Voodoo doll that he dumps in a sea of red before earnings every time.

don't forget Amazon
The spy dip is fucking over!!!!
Its funny how easily it triggers some people meanwhile it was mainstream not so long ago.
&gt; If you hold the spy calls overnight, they will be worth $1.00 each tomorrow and you can sell them for a profit of $0.99 per share to make a total profit of 0%
These algos on TSLA have to absorb a massive influx of stock from Elon... hope they had sidelined 10-15 billion...
Guys if you lost big today, you can snag GME calls rn and make it all back by tmrw
Bro did the fucking traders get lost on their way to work this morning? PUMP that shit UP

Jacked to tits on PLTR fd‚Äôs bought at $24 let‚Äôs go.
Hmmm...should I buy the TSLA dip?
At least  Tesla has like some semblance of a chance at becoming profitable to a degree that makes sense, if everything goes right for the company. 

Personally I agree it‚Äôs overvalued like crazy, but still.
500% 1100P
went to vegas twice this summer, packed both weekends.   
But you know mkt could be retarded
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
You think OPEN gonna drill on earnings?
But if you‚Äôre selling puts you‚Äôre bullish?
Got stuffed on a TSLA call bought yesterday, dumped it and my shares to secure the bag at $40k in profit, after Elon cost me $10k over the weekend. Five minutes later it dumped to hell. Feeling wildly lucky.
should I hold these spy calls overnight or sell and get my RH acc restricted from buying again?
Only thing better than that first rickshaw man doji was the later dragonfly doji that setup the cup and handle formation to finally create that golden cross.

Synergy.
I‚Äôm jacked to the TITS with calls LFG
Stay away it won't stay at its initial offering
If you‚Äôre thinking about buying calls right now‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt go chasing losses by trying to predict the rebound
Looks to be going up with RBLX today. I'm pretty bullish, though I have no real feeling on which earnings will go. It's a pretty long play for me.
Looks like its gonna be a slow bleeder for the rest of the day 

I'm bunkering down
So many stocks feel due for a pullback

ROKU, Z, PYPL, PTON, SNAP
It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúhandling loosing money‚Äù. Anyone who loses 50% of their portfolio in 30 mins is going to be upset
Well, the initial momentum came from the infrastructure bill. I think once the bill was set to go through, these type of announcements were going to come through.
PYPL or V which do you think is the better bounce back play?
Well they didn‚Äôt have to use my tendies as bear bait
What kind of porn? I think I‚Äôm taking a break from it.
I have them out a month from now, hopefully it goes up, plus if it doesn‚Äôt I only have 500 in calls breakeven 12$
Will nvda run again?
SNAP, FB, &amp; PLTR are all up in my ass RN. At the same time

Positions set for next week, now to the real questions.

Selena Gomez or Ariana Grande?
tesla trading sideways right now is only showing its ready to go down more.... that massive dip should have been a much higher rebound.... just sold my shares... buying back in around 900
Facebook is just so undervalued, it's fucking ridiculous
[deleted]
Notice how the graph for everything looks the same? Notice how there‚Äôs ZERO news about this dip on msm? Humans didn‚Äôt expect this. It‚Äôs all algo trading causing it.  

That mean it will correct itself. They got rules about shutting the algos off when they cause big market movements like this. 

That‚Äôs my conspiracy theory at least.
Imagine ever doubting RBLX
All the automakers are constrained by supply right now.  US automakers are definitely focused on trucks because those drive  huge profits.  As far as the Bolt goes, that is last gen battery tech. If GM Ultium batteries fail, then TSLA will see an advantage there.  TSLA gonna make bulls and bears money with it's runs though.
Tesla 11/19 1190 c‚Äôs üßºüß†
tesl sell off at the end of today will be massive
A chart?
Virgins are going back to space I guess
$475 eow
Opened up some 1dte QQQ puts as a hedge

If you're gunna buy calls buy leaps at least. If you wanna buy FDs and bitch about not getting rich then that's another issue
$PYPL calls was not the one ü•≤
Tim üçè trying to save SPY?
If you don‚Äôt hold calls overnight and buy puts in the morning you hate money. Think I‚Äôm gonna buy a case of Champaign. Buy the dip sell the rip.
Buying the temporary dip on PUT PRICES
But did you buy the dip?
It‚Äôs called being retarded
I didn‚Äôt plan on going outside today but I might
Didn‚Äôt expect to be in and out of these Tesla puts so fast but I‚Äôll take that -9% any day. Same time tomorrow boys
I rode a 467 put down to the bottom and made 100%, then bought 469 11/12
Yes

What kind of % in TSLA puts today? HOOD broken as usual
Thanks for the dip.  Resume the pump.

As fucked yo as this sounds. That don‚Äôt mean shit. They own the industry entirely. Absolute cash cow

This is exactly why I don't gamble in large amounts. This market is fucked and makes no sense

Including the part where they don't have enough materials to keep their plant running? yeah, I agree.
gotta inverse urself bruh

Sad to say to my fellow bulls that today I stepped to the dark side for the first time. I bought puts on F....they absolutely printed. I'm back in with calls baby. Calls on F and OCGN. I'm not ready to give SPY my heart back yet after she broke it this morning.
Looks like everything but PYPL is recovering.
Buying
The only thing going up right now is ZNGA. What is happening?
PLTR a good buy here imo
So was that pricing in the CPI data for tomorow?
Trust the process
I can‚Äôt believe that my one positive stock is $SPCE.
Spy calls are the moveüöÄüöÄüöÄüí∞üí∞üí∞
Why zoom out when your option expires in 2 days?
NVDA wants to blast off
Damn I want a bigger dip
Collectively, yes, personally, no.
I bought puts so spy can go back up now, your welcome for my sacrifice
Everyday I tell myself I‚Äôll never buy spy calls at open. Then the next day I do it anyway because ‚Äúthis time, it‚Äôll be different‚Äù. What‚Äôs the name of this disorder?
You don't buy fractional options?
You realize I got the calls at $158 right lol I‚Äôm up sport for BABA. Learn to read‚Ä¶.

Rotation into RBLX
staying clear of all IPOs. Rivian trucks have a built in grill though. Definitely buying calls as soon as i can.
What do you guys think about unity earnings with this metaverse trend?
They care about them so they don‚Äôt get important information leaked duh
only referring to SPY, any 1 stock can tank hard but the media only focuses on the indexes so individual stocks are allowed to drop hard.
I WISH I had $50
Sold my SOXL calls at open to buy this SPY dip

Anything is possible through the power of margin and FDs
Start selling put on PLTR. this shitty stock can't do anything right even with positive earning. Fuck you PLTR
Wait, I know about the wrongful death suits, but when did news break about the murder/federal charges?
yet theyre up.
Same. Gonna go watch porn, I find the market always rebounds when I stop looking at it and watch porn
They feel that way because they are gambling with money they shouldn't be using.
Wanted to buy paypal options yesterday, glad i did wait till now hahaha
U can say so, but I bought really cheap and I believe in company and It would be 700 some days
Relisting from a bankruptcy is bullish and sexy.
Stay away
To get retail to sell so hedgies can buy the dip.
It's been at like 25 for almost a year while almost everything else went up.
Call me a smooth brain. Lost $8k like a dumbass trading calls the last 4 months on PLTR. But. You‚Äôre telling me that after they beat earnings by 10% and revenue up 36% and are down -10% that I should buy more calls now?  Alright
Pls learn how to use options before buying naked calls/puts

They released some good shit
Hard to believe Ford now has higher P/E than Facebook
they might let me live through judgement day if i own a piece of the company though
How to do?
You are crazy to not buy puts right now.... elon didnt even sell yet
&gt; The stock is trading at a very high price to book multiple. It will take years for the company to earn back its current market cap and it has no moat or competitive advantage that we can see.

Think the rebroadcast of the NVDA keynote at 11am EST will help boost the stock back up any?
Just buy at least 1-3 months out minimum
I have a hard time believing a ton of people here are really playing Tesla options Bc of how expensive they r and y‚Äôall are poor. People always complain Amzn options are too expensive here

Where were you yesterday
What a good opportunity to average down on my SPY 12/31 500c
from my understanding they need to file a form for the "plan" of the trade and then they have a window to report after they make the actual trade. Not sure how big that window is but my point is I don't think elon has even sent the form for the plan
Holy shit I'm glad I sold AMD at open, what a bloodbath. All in GME lessgooo
Me.
Live Nation (LYV) is so fucked. They have 20 lawsuits now, 8 murder investigations, 1 federal terrorism investigation.... ive seen businesses fail over 1 lawsuit (NKLA) for example
&gt; Tesla is a company that makes electric cars. It has been around for over 10 years and has made many different models of car, but it only started making profits in the last 2 years - so if you bought shares when it first came out, your investment would have lost money every year until now. If you had invested $10k into Tesla at its IPO (Initial Public Offering), which was about 5-6 years after the company started to sell cars on a regular basis, then today your stock would be worth $1 million dollars
AMD, NUC, FCEL, and CLF
Still holding til Wednesday or Thursday then ima keep playing TTWO. Turns out I know more about what they‚Äôre doing than even their ceo

You should be banned just for making something that shouldn't even be a bet.
Honestly my life is a joke dude I fucking hate it

Tesla tanking? Cool I‚Äôll grab a put. Oh would you look at that, it‚Äôs starting to recover as soon as I buy. Waited a bit to see if it would dip back down but it was steady going up, so I grabbed a call only for it to start tanking again as soon as I buy. Down 50% in 30 mins this sucks
tesla puts!!
Sure did. From what I‚Äôm seeing on TOS the biggest drop was about $85ish. Would have been halted at around $110

Doesn't matter, most of the witnesses that the prosecution has called has actually been in Rittenhouse favor
Picked up some more 475cs today. Hopefully those print lol
Mm Mmm.  Got anymore of that DIP?
just the brownian churn of the moneyvoid

I bought the dip before the dip. Still holding lmao.

‚Ä¶.. by that I mean I thought it was done dipping at 151 lmao
AMD AMD AMD AMD AMD we will get past this bleed soon
TSLA green by EOD????
Yeah, that pump was so fucking sus, but don't blame you for the fomo
Perfect dip buying on PLTR. you have to be a complete smooth brain not to see the bigger picture with Palantir. In the future every medium and large cap stock WILL use Palantirs software as frequently as they use Microsofts. And no I'm not over exaggerating, their SaaS effectively locks clients in as they become dependant on Palantirs software everyday.
PLTR is dead to me. Off my screen.
AMD went on an absolutely absurd rally over the last month.
HOLY ROBOLOX
Institutions control the market, retail just follows along. I don‚Äôt know why they are selling PYPL, but it‚Äôs hurting all of us
Ironically the ROI on options is probably better lol.
Fuck you di caprio, long AMZN
Notice how even minor dips on SPY are quickly bought up? Pretty sure for every red day, someone gets shot.
Only thing keeping my portfolio green is Nvdia bless
AMD pls fly again.
Wow that first hour was a bitch
Maybe if I lived forever I‚Äôd finally see some green in my portfolio.
Anyone else loading up on DIS calls?
Sounds like we got some paper handed bitchs in here
It better my calls are screaming currently

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/EverettSeahawk (0/1) made a bet that GME would go to 190.0 when it was 207.52 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
im never going to financially recover from this ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Cool. Now what?
Amd actually has good news and dropped like a stone, makes sense
Plenty of bagholders, anyone who bought below $20  probably accounts for the massive selloff. Ponzi bc the stock comp packages are a joke - CEO cashes $25m options per month when the company does $400m per quarter sales at 30% margin. Amazon wtf??? Where'd that come from?
Is it PayBag or BagPal?
Tesla on the road back to $1200 EOD
how can RETL be green and XLY red??????

Who is actually buying rsl right now
Do you really even have to ask?
Why did nearly everything crash at open?
Yeah I sold 466.60 brrrr
Tesla pigs getting massacred!
I hope so. I'm sitting on 6.0 spreads and right now the spread is only .80 so it needs to go back up a lot.
Nah. He's fucked too. The Judge has committed so many egregious violations of protocol that the appellate court will remand it for a new trial.
Gg to who bought the ocgn dip.
To the moon we go
Sold one at +300% profit it went up to 1000% ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Love when 0.74 revenue surprise tanks stock 10%. I wait this from dogshit tickers like SDC but PYPL really broke my heart this time.

Looking forward to the ban I guess.
Did Q tell you that?
TTWO took me from 2k to 32k in two weeks. I WILL NOT SHUT UP ABOUT IT
You'd think the probability of every single play I've taken from here being wrong is impossible.........but so far, it's true.

Gonna have some Mexican grill for lunch today
I feel a 3 martini lunch coming on.  üç∏
It‚Äôs down 8-10% whenever PLTR hits a new number 26 25 24 there‚Äôs always a breakthrough of resistance or not. Maybe the market does want it but I don‚Äôt think so. They would‚Äôve bought it and held most likely
The threat of competition is overrated. Most teslas are so backordered that they‚Äôre constrained by supply, not demand but they have new factories going up right now to fill that supply. Teslas EVs are still by far the best you can get. The mustang Mach e is far behind a model 3 and ford makes almost no money on them and is focusing their chips supply to their profitable trucks. The Chevy bolts keep blowing up and their hummer wasn‚Äôt even drivable in the demuro video. The Japanese brands EVs are barely even worth a mention. VAG might be making something decent but I don‚Äôt have any hands on experience with their EVs yet. Tesla is the name brand of EVs. They‚Äôre what coke is to sodas. PlayStation is to gaming. Apple is to phones. Butcorn to criptoe.

I‚Äôve bought and sold Tesla before. Missed out on this last run. I‚Äôm waiting for a floor on this dip to buy in.

Go to a mountaintop. Ponder first the time value of money. Then, consider what it means for a security to be priced. You'll find that in a simple contract, where a buyer holds the right to buy/sell a security at a certain price, at a certain time, there are several factors which influence the value (likelihood and degree of profit) of a contract beyond the current price of a security. Once this wisdom cones from within, google the greeks.

I like lucid. It is probably a good car. I am glad they exist. But the company is auto only, no car insurance, no battery production, no energy business, no software, no super charging network, they have good engineering and a high-quality electric motor. Respect. But 75 billion Dollar valuation?

Yeah, you're right. As much as I would love to hit a 10bagger, the underlying fundamentals of PayPal aren't terrible.

That being said, considering the 214 price support was broken, I'm not convinced that we are going to see a meaningful bounce until we retest 185. Once the Street turns on a stock, it takes a lot to revive it

If you only have 400, and dont know the answers to these questions, options trading is not for you.  Sorry to be real, but needs to be said.  Never buy an option unless youre sure of the direction it will go, if it doesnt go that way, or doesnt go that way even fast enough, you lose money.  Value never just comes back by hitting the strike price, it only comes back when youre in the money, AND, its enough in the money to cover the price you paid for the time it took to get there.  Hope that helps.

I really need to be better at split second decisions, could've sold my RIOT calls this morning at open for 100% gain on the pf and then bought back in like 20 minutes later. Would have been one hell of a trade.

TSLA getting spanked rn
Very red today, boys.
You don't need the stock price reaching your strike to make a profit. If it's going up fast enough you will make money even if the option is otm as long as you unload before expiration.
What a doofy move
How are there not a fuck ton of buyers rushing in to buy PayPal at this price???
That was a quick flash crash
tsla rebound is nut!! must be stupid not buy call!
Anyone buying PayPal at this price?

Tsla got a sale restriction lol
LCID still up 30% this week after massive selloff

CAT and CHPT still up a lot too. I think in the long run these 3 will have huge gains following year. They all benefit huge from infra bill and shifting markets
if you don't have time to constantly check, don't play FDs. I personally use ITM LEAPS as leverage on relatively safe plays like DIS/FB/APPL etc but if you don't have the capital look into spreads.
Fuck. Stay red a bit longer. I am driving to work and can't buy.
this market is convinced and dip will get bought

WTF! fucking dumb ass bulls can't help themselves. Gotta buy the "dip" (aka fomo into top of market after it drops .5%)
So PYPL sell off is an overreaction y‚Äôall think!? ü§î

K cashed in my spy puts from yesterday for a 30% return. Let's go back to bull.
it shouldn't be acceptable for a sell side analyst to lower a price target by 30% after a single quarter almost in line with consensus. No accountability at all.
I'm so retarded... I bought spy calls and they up 20 percent... but my 700 dollar loss is now a wash zzz

If one person reads this, i will be happy

My thing is that if i buy a long term option, wont it just decay and then end worthless, or will it regain if value when it reaches the strike price? Also, how do you do short term options? do you just only do it when your VERY sure it will go up, or do you just pick it ITM, in which case, options trading must take a lot of money to use. And lastly, if i buy an SPY weekly option, that, lets say, has a strike price of 472 when the SPY is at 470 on monday, wont it just lose value until it hits 472, and then will it get its value back? In any case, im poor and only have like 400 dollars in my account, so i might come back to options later when i have more, since i cant find a why to make a profit with that few options, unless their is a MASSIVE short sqeeze going on and i can get in, in which case i might as well just need shares.  I also dont have the time to check and trade more then 1 time a week 2 MAX, so that also makes options hard.

Why? Because you're losing money?

Your crazy of you think Tesla will stay down for longer than 30 minutes
Spce mooning through all of this. R strength.
In my Ron Burgundy voice, "I don't believe you."
CPI data out?
I have a quick meeting and this happens?! Pre-market was a lot more green than this...
Finally rid of mine.  Sold today at barely above even after waiting to see if today would climb or not.  Started drilling at the turn of today and I bailed.
How tf SPCE is green
Anyone buying Tesla calls ??? Iv killed the calls easy gain if Tesla rally back up
Just gobbled some dip. Sold VXX calls for a 30% gain. Turned em into VXX puts to grab another. Flash rug pull = free money. You want extra tendies. Spy weeklies on sale!!!
I like how Tim Cook pretends to care about user privacy when in reality he's just making your data proprietary to AAPL
TSLA PUT gain porn gonna be sweet today
But not going up 7% in less than a month
Why does missed opportunity hurt more than actual losses? Casino life
[deleted]
Okay, so yesterday was a crazy day but what is happening right now?
Not yet. -4% grind. But then, yes. +5000. Then ooo boy, unimaginable decline.
Dip happened the SECOND I went all in on AMD calls. Sorry bros. My bad.
Had the sense to go all cash gang right before the big drop, only lost 50 dollars. AMA
Where is my god now?  Calling Elon on the red phone
14 oct to 08 Nov are basically all gainer days with only 2 outliers. 438 to 470 in 19 days.
If you aren't buying calls on this dip you don't understand how to play the game
We got blessed with this dip tbh
Spce to 30
Everything but SPY is bouncing back. Relax.

Looks like I'm the new proud owner of PLTR @ 25.5

Alright let‚Äôs see the TSLA loss porn
Whole market short ladder attack!!!
This should be a warning that algos are ready to dump tsla in milliseconds, get out now, wait for things to cool down and let the hedge funds battle it out. Do not get in the middle of this war
I‚Äôm poor now
Elon's taking a dump
damn didn‚Äôt realize paypal was a bad company

Damn boys they sunk my battleship. Unless we get a miracle on spy and pltr I'm out the game for a while... POWELL SAVE MY PORTFOLIOOOOOOOOO

Okay for real what is happening? I need to know if it‚Äôs SPY call time
F literally worst time

Someone is going to make a bag on TSLA $1100 weekly calls.
Why is Tesla down 7%?
The fucking kitchen sink is already priced in... This is the start of the reset.  10 million degenerates need to get back to work vs ponzi scheme their way to millionaires.
Face to the floor, prostrate. Catching knives with my prostate.
There's a lesson here: Never buy before earnings no matter what.
TSLA could have been at +1500 is Elon just kept his fucking mouth shut smh
üòÇ
Idk I just want it to cuz I need more shares
&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by this question. I can hear an electric car coming just like a normal one.
[deleted]
How come they murdered it when results were good?
who is saying that though? Everything is bulls screeching and PLTR bulls comforting one another
Well, jumped in TSLA for the first time ever on that dip...
Quick -6%. Like, through Friday.  

But then, yes.
If only I saw this 2 days ago
[deleted]
I would buy that
Wish is up lmao

Elon dumping shares to make a point?!
What‚Äôd you idiots do to cause this?
Most sweaters can't
The WISH calls I sold are ITM and HOOD is giving me an error message when I try to deposit money to buy them back
Okie doke that was good enough thanks.
Who the fuck still uses chegg? There‚Äôs your answer ?
Damn AMD shoulda saw that coming
News?
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up over a percent today.
WTF just happened
I thought Rivian was tomorrow, I meant to sell F before IPO to profit off of the run up and avoid a volatility drop.  I should‚Äôve sold this morning, but I‚Äôve got time.  A pullback after ATH is expected, I‚Äôm still in the money, but I‚Äôll set a stop loss and see what happens.  I‚Äôve got time.
It wasn‚Äôt this negative though, this is the PLTR way to drill.  I couldn‚Äôt sell it fast enough at open.  Had a great day yesterday, earnings today, mostly positive news.  The perfect storm for it to drill.
Today's PLTR is everyone who got in below 20...one tick at yesterday's prices PLTR you Ponzi scheme bullshit merchants and I'll kick you the f\* into touch with your crappy next Amazon insider  pump bull
I bought the dip. The dip bought back.
Alright, you know what? This is dumb. Dump it. Trash it. This one‚Äôs garbage.
Bears wet
I just see other problems. Like humans have adjusted their whole instinct of driving by the sound of an engine. How the fuck do you hear and electric car coming? So they hummm?
Bears r gayin today
Vagina shaped recovery incoming?
Everything oversold. We will bounce
Sold remaining position of GME today, it was fun, made some bags. Now I can close that chapter finally lol
I really do think it's this simple: 

=====

Multi-trillion dollar Hedge Fund algorithms, notice that lots of people are betting that stocks will go up today.

They bombard the market with puts, so as to lower all market prices and take money away from all the Retail People. 

=====

It's kind of like "inverse WSB" but on a much bigger scale.
"Destroyed in Seconds" could do an episode on what just happened to my tesla calls
NeVeR sHoRt TeSlA
WTF happened to PAYPAL ?
Yeah this is a dip you wait to buy.
WISH valued at $15 before Q3 earnings
LMFAO bulls are beyond autistic. "Why are we dropping." "What happened?" Bros, we are crashing over 50-60%+ this is a guarantee. You bought into one of the most overpriced markets in history. Congratulations!
SPCE holding up. Yessir
wtf happened to all the shills who told me BNTX was gonna moon after earnings?

i have $15k in BNTX calls. fuck
8k off of TSLA puts. Lol yayyy

you get 4 within a small time period and 1 "get out free" card.
Maybe at 450
RBLX hasn‚Äôt blinked through all of this
Why do I feel like all those tokens are played by international cosa notsra combines? - I love the way you now real often **cant tell the graph of one token from another** AT ALL - you have to look at the damn name on the graph, else cant tell which you scanning - wonder why 4 or 5 "unrelated" n-FT  have ALL gone up at the same rate and all dropped at the same time (like twice a day??) .. it aint NORMAL, it's  total X-files .. jeeez it's like doped horesracing in there . Used to be OK. Now isn't.
I just bet my meager life savings on Monday.com puts for earnings tomorrow off a random post I saw on here days ago.  Let's see how this plays out.
So high it would get the job done
All bulls: GUH!
Spy 460 puts expiring tmrw only 30 cents. Get em while they're hot !
how is PLTR not short sale restricted yet lol
Why would the greatest company on the planet ever drop?
BNTX had good earnings today right? Beat expectations right? Down 4%... makes sense.
Dude SPY is moving in full increments of .10 and im scurt
SPY can go so much lower
It‚Äôll bounce
Yes you are one of the sane ones lol Has a couple of gaps in that area.
Tesla would have been the easiest short today. Missed it, because of work. Fml.
That was the bottom boyz‚Ä¶..

If u got long options, IV expansion.
Ayyyy PLTR we‚Äôre back to 23 again.  Fucking dead.
Morgan's sweater can barely contain those cannons
Did it really go up 19 days in a row?
yeah I'm not catching this falling knife. will check back in a few hours to see what I want to buy.
TSLA looks like a bad earnings call right now.

Being able to daytade is a lifesaver.
TSLA and LCID rug pull lol
Kind of amazed NVDA isn't red TBH. Calls from last week still floating the calls I bought today.
Well I am losing copious amounts of money but at least I get upvotes from random strangers on Reddit cancels out the debt I am putting my family in !
Any hope for chegg to recover?
y not?
Paypal keeps drilling
Has Nancy P. Made any new trades recently?
What a shitshow lol
Is this the dotcom?

-Bears, probably
Are we getting ready to bounce?
He hasn't even sold yet
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUCK

Just dont forget to buy the dip this time
Anything you want tbh

Don‚Äôt worry guys I bought a spy put. Recession cancelled
I'm down almost a full 1%.  I must be overleveraged.
Glad i had a technical call today and did not buy anything this morning. Damn bears trying to win today
SPY CALLS NOW
What are we buying the dip on boys?
Oh thank god all this red in my portfolio is just Robinhood glitching this morning...
Some guy came up to me, handed me a bag marked "EVGO", and asked me to hold onto it for him. Then he walked away with my wife. You guys think they'll be back soon?
its over guys, pack it up.
Also RH is restoration hardware
Everything has shat the bed. Good day everyone.
MSFT fight the red!!!
wow so were at prices from last week. big scary
If PLTR breaks below 24 they should oust Karp for Daniel Craig. Skyfall
Made 3k with TSLA calls. Finally a good trade.
LMAO
Just put on another SMH short... already working so noice!
Please no i sold 5.5 calls tf why am i so retarded
You're the real MVP ASTS.
I hate myself for not selling my calls when they were up. God greedy and waited.
Cool cause I own a bunch at $12. FML
No Tesla in FH5, explains everything

Was the inflation data really that bad???
Eh, it will be green again in a while, you‚Äôre right, people are freaking out too much
The market is dumping because it has gone up 19 days in a row, something that has almost never happened before in SPY history. This is just a healthy correction/cool off
Shut the fuck up kid.

When adults are talking, don't butt in with your illiterate ass
you have 3k how are you buying more LOL
Y‚Äôall stupid as hell for buying calls lolllll
Idk how but I‚Äôm green today
Will RH mark me as pattern day trader on first offense?
Pltr down 10% now
Anybody check on jason dabolt?
Yes my SQQQ calls gonna be printin üè≥Ô∏è‚ÄçüåàüêªüíÖ

Why is Tesla down 7%?
That's how it should be. This market will crash 50-60%+ when all is said and done

Because Ford is going to crush it over the next year and it‚Äôs literally worth about the same as companies with no product
Rip literally everyone except Elon cos he fuccs
TESLA going to be under 1K EOD
who still had TSLA weeklies after the stunt Elon Musk pulled over the weekend???
My Roth IRA is blood red now. Maybe because it‚Äôs 100% TSLA
I mean he did give warningüôÑif y‚Äôall greed it‚Äôs on you.

What‚Äôs goin on with $WISH? False alarm?

Why does there have to be news? There was no news when it kept going up?

Just sitting on his office printing money, then shredding it, printing, shredding
pltr earnings started the market wide dump.
hope you guys are buying the dip
He doesn't do stupid options plays like me.  He actually buys shares of the companies I tell him...I got him to buy a shit load of Enphase @40, Etsy at 140, lucid @18, AMD @30, NVDA @80 pre-split.  And he has been holding Tesla since 150 pre-split
Anyone know of any good bridges nearby
I‚Äôm off to the food bank. Hope to see of you there
Come on GOOGL dip you son of a bitch join your friends
Elon tweet always does it
Grabbed some 1250 TSLA calls at less than $6 a contract. Already based back to 8$ a contract and the price is LOWER than when I bought. 
Thanks for the panic sell, fake bulls!
PLTR: Forever tied to 24
This rollercoaster of an emotion is too much. My ass hurt from all these pounding
Did the TSLA put guy delete his post?
I‚Äôm gonna go get some sleep
These SPY puts ended up being a good ifea
so glad I held onto my tesla puts this morning holy fuck just made a killing
Hilarious this ponzi scheme acts the way it does... If you're not in the "know"... better hope you don't get caught when they reset the price.
Unpopular theory:

TSLA stabilizes around 1000 and then Elon announces split, thinking it will boost the price up again, but instead the market is tired of his shit and it proceeds to drop 40%. I don‚Äôt think this will happen but it would be funny.
Get ready to lose that 1500
Just admit to yourself that your messiah fucked you over and move on
They got scared of GME so crashed everything üòÇ
So monthly‚Äôs you think?
I think Elon sold

TSLA went down around 20 billion
What‚Äôs happened?
Look at tech lol
&gt; "The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."
What strikes and exp you snag for puts
We are down half a percent after an 8% rally over the past 3 weeks, is this the end of the world as we know it?
VXX calls saved my ass
In better news, Horizon 5 is out on Gamepass lol.
because you woke up. Go back to sleep!
Black Friday came early
profit is profit
Holy fucking shit my calls are all fucked
what's up with the reee?
that means the ride up is slow and steady‚Ä¶
&gt; I'm not sure if you're joking, but I'll take your comment as an insult.
Welp weekly NIO and Sofi options are going down in flames today.
Didn‚Äôt think ‚Äúnegligence‚Äù would have this severe an impact.
TSLA weekly 1100c starting to look interesting
PYPL 100 eod lmao
So what are we buying now for the inevitable V recovery?
Bulls in shambles ü•∞
Some guy outside the Washington monument
The panic that can occur in this sub in \~30 minutes. You guys.
Lol less than a week after I give up on puts we get a thicc red dropsy morning. My calls are now way OTM. Should probably just cut losses honestly, down by 40%. Guess I‚Äôll wait and see how the day goes though.
Sleepy Joe's infrastructure boost is a bust!
That's a very juicy medium rare steak. Give my compliments to the chef.

#HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN! +7% AND 90% GREEN DAYS IN THE PAST MONTH BUT HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?!
I just sold on the second bottom. I‚Äôm not usually a bear so I‚Äôll take 200% off of puts. Always try to take profits.
I might have to. It's bleeding like a mf.
Gay bear season. But why though?
This is his fault? What he do?
I wish I could "hide" contracts that are worthless well before expiry tbh
3 days
Lol where‚Äôs that ford ‚Äúmillionaire‚Äù that thought he was the new DFV?
Is this the apocalypse?

Who shit the bed this morning? Spy‚Äôs struggling hard
One last yolo on COIN. Over the past year I have been up and down like crazy and just ending with losing $500. Can't deal with the stress. Seeing the earning for COIN then cashing out and just going to play with $1500 might try to learn calls.
Why?
F doesn't deserve this
Wsb in shambles. BTD bitches.
UVXY to 18
I bet a lot of people here hate Elon right now lol

The comments on here sound like all those fucks in titanic running around in a panic when that shit started going down
I just did, so probably not.
Did Musk actually sell?
This drop is so fake. The euphoria was palpable. It‚Äôs not gone. Santa Claus about to show back up.
How tf do some of you clean up your nut with such little tp or tissues
Ugh I always feel like I‚Äôm buying the dip and it‚Äôs ALWAYSSS dips way more
I‚Äôve never seen my money just disappear faster then what happening in the past 15 minutes
Why did the market just have a huge dip?  What‚Äôs the news?
Sold my puts for 7K profit, should have held them.
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU GUYS HOW $TSLA WOULD SELL OFF DURING THE WEEKEND. WE'RE ON BULLET POINT 2 RIGHT NOW. AND FOR EVERYONE IN WSB WHO BOUGHT CALLS YOU'RE IN BULLET POINT 1

Spy is gonna be green by end of day
I LOVE WHEN THE MARKET RANDOMLY DROPS 1% IN A MINUTE

Good thing you didn‚Äôt just say it. You declared it ü§£
Saying goodbye to ford go now. It was a hell of ride, I will never forget you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
I have a weird feeling that this shit will turn around after lunch,  but I've been very wrong before
This was so obviously coming üòè when absolute trash like LCID and TLRY starts ripping that‚Äôs your signal to exit longs
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

whew. thanks Elon!
Walked away for 20 minutes. Da faq happened?
I‚Äôm eating this PINS dip tbh
MICHAEL BURRY JUST WENT FACEBOOK LIVE OF HIM JACKING OFF FURIOUSLY
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

It‚Äôs reached the point the fucking apes actually dragged the whole market down
When do I pick up this PLTR dip
Just like the cybertruck, the Tesla dump is showing up late
So when do we make 1100 calls on tesla lol

People thinking RIVN gonna come and save them like Stone Cold in the attitude Era, stunners for everyone!
I guess I will not be looking at the market any more today. Fucking cocksuckers
LMAO someone blew up their account today and is rage downvoting every comment
I think I entered the wrong casino
Don‚Äôt see how PayPal -10% after already being down 40% isn‚Äôt an overreaction. This stock dead or something?
Wtf did I wake up to
Good day to load up on spy calls
PLTR wrong wayü§®ü§® üöÄüöÄüöÄ
I will simply not look at the market today.

when to buy PUT
[deleted]
im not a fucking dumbass I'm aware. The dumbasses are people who roll profits on a 250 point hulk dick month into calls expiring 48 hours away. You earn your losses but characterizing ANY amount of movement away from your strike as "drilling" is pathetic as fuck.

Hey PLTR gang. GOOGL is growing faster than PLTR and is trading at a P/S of 9 compared PLTR which is trading at P/S 30+. Faster growth for 1/3 the price and they actually turn a profit.
I know. Thats why I got puts.
Don't forget ROBLOX. That shit's mooning
I'm a noob and learning options. Would I be smart to buy a handful options expiring eoy ? And just holding until then ?
PLTR lmfao

Been holding PLTR for just about a year now, this is nothing new. Average down and keep holding, or take the L and cry about it. Anyone long term holding saw this coming a mile away.
Fucking Shit PayPal isNt that a little Bit of an overreaction?
I always find it amazing one bad day wipes out three positive days
Any süçës today?
Plus many companies do it themselves.
Looking at my RBLX call debit spread is quite disappointing in the grand scheme of things, but who knew a children's video game company would shoot up 20 bucks for earnings.
Never change, AMD. I waxed my asshole in preparation for this morning fucking.

Sometimes stocks just keeping getting lower and lower bud‚Ä¶ 52 week low doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a buy or a hold. You can actually continue to lose your shit‚Ä¶ stop diamond handing crap and cut losses there are thousands of others plays to make it back.
Same here. Stupid shorts
Drill team 6 what u doin??
Treat palantir like apple. Buy now and wait before earnings to dump.

It's 2040. PLTR has used its blackbox technologies combined with access to government data collecting to exert influence in worldwide events. They hack devices and create deepfakes and mobilize trollfarms with ease. They manufacture consent among populations and governments. They are the global deep state, the Illimunati made manifest.

Share price: $24

If you bought Pltr calls you truly deserved it. PLTR has done this since the dawn of time. They could cure AIDS and they‚Äôd dip 20%

Indeed, I had said it earlier, my bad for being a rude piece of shit. You didn‚Äôt know, all good. Yeah, I put cultural victory in quotes because I don‚Äôt agree with the practice, either. It‚Äôs stupid and can often times be dangerous with the rushes. But it happens regardless. I‚Äôm merely talking about why holding the stock for the holidays might be beneficial, not the morality of it. Also, I understand the metric of quarter to quarter, but if they don‚Äôt sell all of that inventory (something that they will do more effectively by withholding it for Black Friday, manufacturing a frenzy), then they will have a shittier Q4.

It all depends. This is an event that is binary in results but not binary in odds. Successful launch= üìà Rocket Explodes üìâ but they have a 90% launch success rate and each failure they have increases the chances that future launches are successful. Plus they‚Äôre like the only public rocket company that has actually put satellites in orbit

Puts on COMCAST. Nationwide outtage
Does Rivian go public at opening or sometime during the day ?
I feel you, Oof that sinking feeling. Maybe add back a position slowly
Not a bad move
When RBLX had their IPO, I bought around $70, and it got to $103. I sold off, and it dropped, now back on the rise so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not too late. May take some time though.
BNTX, what an AMAZING company.
Nvda 340 c
All I did was buy one $PYPL call yesterday since it was so low and this shit drops $17. How can one stock be so shitty?
Roblox is the middle man between game creator and player. They allow game creators to build in their metaverse (since 2008) and allow them to charge money for subscriptions and microtransacrions within those games.

Roblox keeps the lights on, any one with an idea can build a game on it, players play what they want with their one avatar shared across the metaverse (or can create custom characters depending on the games).
Go Lcid go!!

All I can think of is ‚Äúthe cultural victory.‚Äù Yeah, Black Friday sucks tremendously, but with Covid numbers down in the states and people trying to give their kids/themselves that one special thing for Christmas this year, holding for Black Friday might generate enough of a retail rush that will yield a lot of sales in an instant.

This is the only WSB mod that isn‚Äôt gay

/u/SK_customs (1/0) made a bet that RBLX would go to 100.0 when it was 77.0 and it did, congrats retard.
PYPL going under 200?
So what are you guys doing today?
I just come back from 7 days in the Dominican Republic where it was 86 the entire week. I live in Maine where today it‚Äôll be a nice 64 but it‚Äôs been averaging 50‚Äôs during the day and 30-40 at night
When PYPL delisted?
Remember boys todays peak is tomorrows low, no dips
Yep, def not a good position to be in.  I still can't fathom NVDA (and AMD) being so humongous already, top 10 in SPY for NVDA at least, going 200-325 in 1.5 months.  Feels like a smaller company would do that but huge companies move so much slower.  Oh well.  I sold 250s around 225 and that fucked me over so much.  I can only hope it doesn't pump after earnings, which it prob will tho.
You‚Äôre comparing a 100k/car company to a video game? Sheesh lol
Not announced yet
Says nov 14th when i look it up on google
NVDA makes me hornier than my uncle
Lidar is back on the menu boys
Dude, why would you sell it on a pop. The news seems to be solid for a momentum run. Which means you hold it for at least a week beyond yesterday to see how high this thing can run
Imagine talking about I-bonds ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ boomer investing. Honestly how can they invest like this in the greatest bull market of all time. 7% might as well be 0% in this market.
Ditto, wait for it.

Old news. I have calls since $115, added more at $130, and it's been nothing but up.
I concur....
If they are ITM then your broker will usually sell them for you automatically.  If they are not, then they were probably hoping until the last minute that it would turn around.  Unfortunately there is a point of no return where it's worth hoping for the turn around and eating the loss vs getting what cash you can back.

Ppl value it to be?
Does a warehouse manager come free with the purchase?
My trading requires more than a web app. I need to be able to see the tape.
If you are theta gang, you want them to expire worthless so you keep the premium. If you bought the option, sometimes there's no buyer and they expire if you don't have the $$ to execute. Things like that
Your flair.
Thanks for the info! I haven‚Äôt gotten the booster. I asked him last night ‚Äúyou think I should get the booster? Im only 29‚Äù his only words were ‚Äúwell‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve already had Covid‚Äù.

The two things I look for in a lady
Have you watched earnings this year or just got in yesterday?

I dont touch it unless earnings are happening because it usually dumps like pltr
SPY isn't supposed to have 1% days. This isn't normal.
PLTRtards yelling stop the count
Because they're worthless
Fo reel? Buy some more Ark...
Can anyone confirm RIOT earnings date? I am seeing conflicting info all over the interwebs. Thanks
pypl gonna dick me down
PYPL selling off because of lower guidance, sell off due to people not in work which means they have less money on hand and use buy now pay later services which is eating into its core bussiness
Sell the AMC puts right at open? Or will it fall some more today?
i'll be on the receiving end with my spy calls. #abouttotakeitintheazz

Yeah, I don‚Äôt see anywhere about them offering discounts. Just that they will be amply stocked for the holiday. It beats being up-charged by some scalper fuckheads using botnets to buy en masse.

that's my goal, I almost have a DP but idk where to buy. I refuse to buy  locally because I hate it here(only moved here for a job I no longer have) and it's incredibly overpriced(boston metro). I work remote but my company is based in ME so I could buy something there and go into the office whenever I want but I really don't want to live in ME. I really want to buy something in my old college town as I love it there, have friends there, and property is dirt cheap but to be fair besides the colleges, there isn't much happening there so idk how much the property would appreciate over time. Even the current RE ATHs haven't impacted their values

People pay to remove pain. Your solution should remove pain. It could be an awesome product but if it doesn't remove pain for someone they won't buy it.

I mean shit people talk about buying lambos here. They are buying them to remove the pain of the fact they couldn't buy one at some point but now they can. It's not that they like lower backpain, planning their routes to avoid speed bumps, and only going 30mph because they are stuck in traffic.

They like the fact they can now buy them. That removes the pain of not being able to buy them.

Bought some yesterday, will buy more today. Im using my profit on my calls to acquire more shares. I might even let my current calls get assigned to get a discount.
Yes, SPY gonna gap up
Meme season is upon us....hop on.
Partnership != buyout
PTON news for the save but that‚Äôs one expensive Kinect sensor even though they‚Äôve been around for over a decade. I need them to add more machines though. If they can get a nice set of machines but keep the $40/month for all the machines they would be good. Paying $40/month for one machine is stupid.

Tesla 1200 today and I won‚Äôt fap for a year
would you be upset if you lost the gains you have? Do you think it has more of a run in it? Does it dip at open only to rip after? 

Answer all these for yourself. Remember everyone is here to make money just not as a team. Guarantee someone will lose today and someone will win.  best case is set a limit at some price you can stomach and watch it.
Over-valued, mediocre earnings, and poor guidance for 2022.

Dont sell at open, if crypto is a thing, then so as nvidia. They are just gonna keep growing
I wouldn‚Äôt call Portland ‚Äúunderrated.‚Äù It‚Äôs got great parts and shitty parts but overall it‚Äôs pretty prominent among US cities.
lol market can do what it wants so long as uvxy keeps going up
Honestly, Walmart isn‚Äôt bad to invest in, lol.
Am normally fine with my CCs, but on whenever I end up missing out on a huge runup, FOMO, and buy them back, I end up buying at the top.  So I've resisted buying them back for the past two weeks and shit keeps skyrocketing.  Insane.  Just about to crack and buy them back at significant losses and resell further out / higher up to recoup some of those losses.  So obviously tomorrow we'll dump.
NVDA gonna make me cream at work
Going to be a BIG day for NIO
Maybe it includes dental
It‚Äôs funny you say that. The most amount of high school I‚Äôve ever missed was during the hight of the swine epidemic. I had viral meningitis and everyone thought I was dying of swine since I missed like 2 weeks

EDIT: I‚Äôll probably straddle LMND for as cheap as possible. I could see it go right back to $71 or drop to $55.
Portland is one of the most overrated. Liked Milwaukee and Charlotte a lot. Never been to Minneapolis and hopefully never will.
They have 10k preorders and someone already has one as of last month
I‚Äôm up 30% on my paper trade account. If I made those same exact moves with my actual money I‚Äôd be getting a margin call right about now

I don't disagree.  Dramatic change is usually pretty exciting, but it would suck to have your financial accounts drained, or any other type of fraud occurring repeatedly, simply because we created something without taking the time to figure out how to use it safely.
I want to but idk where to buy, I hate where I am currently living and will be moving OOS once my lease is up. Not sure where to though, I work remote so I can go anywhere but my company is based in maine. I like my team and company but I really don‚Äôt want to move to ME either.
Stop trying to slow NVDA's rise to $400 before earnings.  Let it happen.
Please PayPay, if you don't go back to 300 my stepdad will give me the belt.
looks like another big day for amd and nvidia
Price action looks great but I‚Äôll probably sell to get back in at a different contract price, taking some profits

Also PLTR: 3.4% drop in stock value

TSLA: Haha i go up now
I mean what do you want them to do?
An earnings call bro. With chump change like that it‚Äôs your best bet
Yes but by drilling through the center of the earth, coming out the other side and looping back around
Is it just me, or is it really hard to take Elon Musk seriously after finding out he wears a cock cage and the key is worn around the neck of his wife's boyfriend.

It's still IV. Just in the opposite direction. Could be called IV creep if you wanted.
Retail is too invested in the market now there's no going back.  Even if we get to a bear market where indexes trade flat or down, there'll always be 1000%+ gain options plays every day just due to the retail pump factor.
You probably have lots of money try buying houses and renting
last time i go against my algo that told me to sell pypl.

It does but after iv crush

NVDA under 350 will look unreasonably cheap after earning
its been 5 days since SPY had a +1% day üîÆ üß§ sooth sayer say!
&gt; Sell at open
GE announced they are splitting into 3 companies. Popped 5% so far over night. Possible pop after open.
Same on Nvidia. Ugh
AMD leaps it is on a retrace then haha
i mean at least you didnt piss the bed. last time i had a nightmare like that i did
Lmao I think ive been holding for 12 months now... Im sure the ER will make her rise a little. Good idea fellow apes.  


Question though. Will the ER of NIO raise the stock more so than the gains on AMD we will probably see this week. I can see AMD hitting 200 easy.
NVDA into having sex, it ain‚Äôt into making love
PYPL of course
Spy puts seem to be on the menu this week. SPY has been flat the last few days but the rising Vix seems to be predicting a huge SPY drop in the next few days. I am not sure it will actually happen, but SPY needs to do something or the Vix will keep rising until it does. My UVXY puts are bleeding everyday...
SPY up so much last 2 years‚Ä¶. 4 years of flatness confirmed, all in dividend stock is the play

Just got my negative covid test result back. Been out of work since Thursday and everyday it‚Äôs like it gets worse. When I made an appointment with my doctor they legit just ask you the covid questions and do a swab test and then he told me isolate and wait 24 hours. Dude fuck you I‚Äôve already had Covid and the shot. Last time I had Covid I wouldn‚Äôt have even have known. Now there‚Äôs what? NO fuckin diagnosis but just a ‚Äúhey fuck you good luck whatever you have covid or not.‚Äù  anyways rants over
Sounds like im waiting for a dip then.
This week
PYPL just dying. Damn.
Defined by a single tweet is right. Fuck.
BNTX
and then when it gets to 70 is it gonna go to 80?
Did the CEO of PYPL get a swastika tattooed on his forehead and shoot an unarmed black man during the earnings call or something?
Is that supposed to make an internet stranger feel bad? My mom passed away last year too. In july.
I‚Äôm definitely doing this
What else is up to bat, to dump on earnings....?
Doubtful they will hold for black Friday.

The way retail does black Friday is they provide a different set of SKUs (barcodes) for the same named product. The difference is the quality of parts that went into it.

Tvs are a prime example. You can Google this. You can buy a Sony Bravia TV for $1800 or wait till black Friday and get the same name TV for $1200. The difference is the CPU and the number of external ports. The $1800 will have 5 HDMI ports. The $1200 will have 3 or 4.

Costco, Sam's club and Target do this as well depending on the items (those companies need specific margins and are willing to compromise with the brands to get the product to that price point.)

It's pretty fucked up, but yeah those black Friday bundles often have inferior made products (no name brand internals, different manufacturer, etc) the retailers have the same margins or a little better but not a lot.

So doubtful they can just horde those products to sell at discount on blackfriday.
IPOs are usually a sucker‚Äôs bet one day 1 at the publicly accessible entry point.  There are exceptions, but unless you‚Äôre day trading be careful the first few days on any IPO.
You can earn money with TSLA without actually believing it's not ridiculously overvalued
Funny you mention this, I truly would not invest in Tesla because of the ridiculousness with social media hype etc‚Ä¶ too much risk.
Positions? When you going to sell them
If you‚Äôre worried, just become bearish, always opportunities

Its a long term bet on EV battery material demand. Short term iron and coal prices create the opporitunity imo. 10% dividend make up for the softness short term to me.

This is going to be today's obvious play, either it drills down or retardly goes up, either way people are going to be like " I fucking knew it"

Dont always have to go long.  I bought calls for $600 last wednesday.  Cashed them out on thursday for $30,000.
Hold this. Massive potential with metaverse.
lol I think I did. Honestly every time I see your username I think of my little cousin. His nickname is Axeman.
done already
LCID is going to crash so bad when earnings drop, they have next to zero sales and spend like crazy. Once people see the books and poor sales for 2022 that stock will tank and go back to 25 bucks until they can produce cars and show large orders. 

Everything they say is speculation, its the biggest BS game I ever saw, they produce zero and promise everything, that screams bad news. 

Good luck
Feeling slightly less retarded today because my biggest positions are SOFI and RIOT
and paying for everything, including the bootie.
AMD leaps will prob make you rich. AMD still has great product but nvda is slightly better in every aspect. But AMD will catch up it makes no sense for AMD not to be at nvda levels given the right amount of time
This non stop upward momentum is honestly scary.

My first-ever investment was basically a YOLO into NVDA longs. 

I did some reading and learned a lot since then, and I trimmed my position significantly to diversify my portfolio. I really wish I didn't! Being "smart" with my portfolio has literally cost me thousands! NVDA is still my largest position though, so I'm happy to see it continue to run.

It was the same guidance every other company have said. Stimmy and no more welfare checks are going to cause a slow down, but long term outlooks are good.

Out of all the companies you can gamble calls with in this insane market you choose PLTR. You must love to be poor.
I'm surprised WSB is not big on quantum computing plays like IONQ. Not other technology would change the face of the earth other than quantum computing... Well that is until we have realistic robot sex dolls.
that makes sense, I'm a dom

I would probably wait until Friday and buy calls for next week. This idea is based strictly on V activity after earnings.
market so bullish even weed stocks are looking good

market back on easy mode

been a while
Every day I tell myself that LCID has hit the top and there is no money left to be made - in fact, a pull back is imminent.  Now my TSLA calls look like crap and SPY is in a coma.  I should have played the LCID game.

TSM fabricates chip designs by AMD, NVDA, AAPL, etc. You could say AMAT, LRCX, ASML are providing the handles and picks for TSM to make pickaxes out of. But the analogy starts to get stretched pretty thin.

The point is that mega companies rely on TSM for volume production of advanced mode chips.

Wait for slight pull back, go grab a Ford 22 leap for 1.90 now. Ford will hit 24 or 25 today minimum. Your leap will double or triple. AMD burns out and regasses for another burn out. You need to time it correctly. F is basically free money until $30

Dude seriously if you dont even understand basic shit you probably shouldnt be here. Or rather youd be better off asking in /stocks

But SPY is always a safe bet.
What a week this is shaping up to be!  First, $EVgo yesterday, which is still running up today and now $UWMC beat earning's today.   Both are $20+ stocks that have been masquerading as sub$10 stocks.

Any predictions with RIOT earnings call
Might be a red day for me tbh might actually get some work done lol
Hi everyone, I got 650$ loaded up been saving for a while to make a play. What do you recommend? I've lost 12k since trading I'm not good. So I'm inquiring to someone who actually makes good plays. I just want to see what it feels like to make a winning trade. I don't want to flip 650 to 20k although that be cool. Tempering expectations so if there's a play to make like 300 to see what a win looks like that be cool. K appreciate have a dope day
Hate red days on my account. Have enough other shit that it's possible to erase the mistake that is PYPL.
Bought some TTCF 19c yesterday. Tofurkey may be the best we get this year

Running a PMCC on DIA and my short call is currently in the money so I need inflation numbers to temporarily nuke the Dow. Sorry for being bear-curious this morning.

I had 10 165 puts expiring this week. Sold half of them for a measly 20% gain. For the rest, hoping for a pton/chgg like dump. But judging by my precious earning plays with Roku calls and Pins puts, it will just moon.

Interested to see what DOCS does this afternoon after earnings. It more than doubled after its last earnings report, but it's been cut nearly in half since then before recovering a bit. Still bullish on this one. A company that's captured 80+% of all American physicians has created for itself one of the strongest moats on Wall Street imo.

How many people selling PLTR calls on open for an L?
Question is if the pump is a matter of hours or days? If it's a matter of a few days you can buy at whatever price in the first day and sell the next day. Easy money? No?
The dumpsters out back
$MGNI and $PUBM my highest conviction multibaggers for 2022. These two are very undervalued imo.
So dash Puts are free money right?
Well why double. Why not aim for 10 bagger. If you ten bag 1000 three times that's a million right there.
I'm still using DoorDash because I'm lazy, and wait times for me are longer than they were during COVID.
I wonder what SPY is going to do today
So that's why my OTM bets never go ITM. Gonna keep my phone at under 10% for the 10 baggers

Why is tlt spiking?
PLTR and dumping on good earnings. Name a more iconic duo
I can't believe I lived through two biggest market crashes in history (08 and 20) and I barely made any money because I was playing penny stocks and then retarded options rather than just sticking everything into spy leaps which would have made me rich. So depressing.

I jumped in, and it's rocketed. Thank you random redditor! lol
Every one of us works to accumulate wealth but people will get mad that guys like Elon and Bezos are doing it better than them. Fucking every time I open up Reddit's front page there's the same "people who are more successful than me are bad" garbage.

NOW - VZ under $55.  VZ is a coiled spring ready to explode.

I like GM too but I think this week is all about Ford because of Rivian.  A lot of money chasing Ford as a sympathy play right now and to revalue it.

Long term I think both Ford and GM will be winners.  Market wants to invest in potential EV winners and those are only 2 cheap names left so they're being revalued.

I don‚Äôt think Elon selling shares should crush the stock. It‚Äôs extended but there are enough funds in Tesla to absorb most of it. I would think anyways. 
Edit: and it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs hitting the market it one day. Doesn‚Äôt work like that.
I'm sure PLTR is just dropping from euros trying to secure their measly +10%. It will shoot back up after the report is out
Higher than giraffe pussy
Do I sell my 1/21/22 PYPL 230cs for more F...

I think I know my answer
DoorDash puts are probably gonna print. More people are grocery shopping and eating out again and not hiding in their houses relying on delivery man. Peloton died for the same reason, definitely think a 67 billion valuation on DoorDash is autistic.
These pltr bagholders think the market revolves around their shit stock

Why did the spy color change red?
They throw DWAC holders a little $2 mid day bump every few days just to keep the zombies attached. Easiest bunch of people in the world to scam out of money
JPow speaking today?
PLTR again beats on revenue, despite revenue growth slowing down from 49 to 36 percent compared to last quarter. However, due to the nature of its business it is very hard for the company to show vast improvements in that department( the deals they sign are spread out over time and sometimes not even accounted for in the quarter they are signed). The important metrics for Palantir are new deals signed and total outstanding deal value and it seems that they are doing amazing. No wonder that they raised guidance.
Is it worth buying calls on the IWM dip?
I just want to see where they have Karp standing in the earnings call.
Just in: SPY is teaming up with the Metaverse.

PTs don't really work the same with options because of theta. You have to calculate whether the intrinsic+extrinsic value of the option puts it over your price target, not just whether the stock price is over your price target.

Ford is probably the best "EV" play right at this very moment (only because others have run so much like LCID/TSLA).  Market is finally revaluing Ford to its future prospects as an EV company in 10-15 years.

PLTR knocked earnings out of the park. Obviously it tanked, but I‚Äôm buying.
Market pricing in the death of reality in 2030. Metaverse all the way.
Imagine not selling ATM calls on PLTR 10 minutes before close the day before it‚Äôs earnings reports.
Rblx sneakily up 25%‚Ä¶
Thought about averaging down, figure  I can buy 3x my 230Cs for January  at this point.
They don‚Äôt expect to be able to produce 150,000 cars/year until 2023 so that will be a long order to fill.

Ok, your hatred for kids makes a lot more sense.  Lol.
PLTR will end green at an all time high.  you just gotta believe
what an absolute beast nvda and amd is
better off giving no-kill shelters your money.
Tsla and even lucid do. Ford is going to make their own soon
Mods can you please ban this cuck lol enough is enough
If you own PLTR shares and aren't selling CCs on them you're better off putting your money in a savings account, better returns.

Sad thing is, I won‚Äôt even get karma for the gain porn on my TSLA puts. Am bear. Get downvote. Is way of life.
Got NVDA, AMD, MARA calls  and some GME just in case the apes decide to go apeshit over the Ryan Cohen Tweet.  Looking like its gonna be a good day.  üòé

think it drops at open or does another $30 day?
You mean 1-year chart. Its yearly (candle) chart isn't impressive.

that doesn't change what i said. if your target increases and the stock price is still below that value then either hold or buy more. only sell once it is above your PT

NVDA to $1 trillion is not a meme... this thing really looks like it could happen.  From $500 billion market cap a month ago, to crossing $800 billion early today.

At a certain point the momentum just becomes inevitable when the market is melting up like this and money is flooding into big caps.  Doesn't matter if it's illogical or not, just feels like NVDA is heading to $400/$1 trillion market cap; same type of action we've seen out of TSLA the past couple of weeks.  Just relentless momentum.

Watch the option chain, could go into continuous gamma upward move like TSLA did with tons of calls being bought ahead of the stock price.
Cracked and greasy screen, busted case, and a constant battery charge of 27% with the low power mode on because the battery health is for shit.

that's why you should have a target value. sell once it goes over that, buy more once it goes beneath that or the target increases
I learnt from coinbase I was bagholding for months up until this Monday not fun

Sofi should be strong
PLTR actually had a solid earnings report.  Beat on revenue and raised guidance above analyst expectations.

Has been up 10-20% past few weeks so might sell slightly or move sideways, but not a bad earnings report like some of the ones we've seen recently (see SDC).
What's the great news? They basically just met expectations.
I can tell you who's getting MORE. Feel like a dipshit only getting 20 11/12 320c yesterday at EOD. Had 50 queued, and worried Jensen might just go out and shit on the stage.
Bud, that ain‚Äôt even close to the top. It‚Äôs a terribly kept secret that Karp and the other insiders are pinning this under 30 until all the retail traders that bought over 30 give up and sell at a loss.

[As Americans have become less religious over time](https://i.imgur.com/gLZHAcm.jpg), they‚Äôve taken that religious energy into every other aspect of their lives including the stock market. Robinhood and TOS have become our churches. Not sure if this was a great trade.

Thank ya!
Good, you just described what anecdotal evidence is.
I have owned it for a little over 6 years now.  It's been an absolute beast in my portfolio and dwarfs every other position I hold.  There's going to be some volatility with it as it just broke 100+ on the PE.  Agree that it will hit $420 at some time....but I'm not counting on that for a few years.
It‚Äôs meme stock season son

I just look at the charts. Buy low sell high

Pypl will likely bounce around $214-$215 today

If you didn't sell your CLF after earnings you deserve this

They announced an acquisition of a car insurance company MILE.  

They got it at a steal imo.  MILE has \~200M in cash, over 100M in annual premium, and the deal is an all stock deal at \~500M so they paid \~200M for the lock stock and barrel of an operating car insurance company.

The MILE investors got screwed pretty badly lol

/u/Cupricine (1/0) made a bet that PLTR would go to 28.0 when it was 26.41 and it did, congrats fucker.
Fucking seriously. My portfolio was worth ~$18k 3-4 weeks ago. It‚Äôs now worth ~$38k. 

LCID has seen a meteoric rise too considering its percent change in price.
Can anyone point me to the Jerome powell Brrr meme that came out about 2 weeks'ish ago that was set to a rap tune? (thing is unfindable on account that there are evidently as many copies of that meme as there are bills of money printed).

*Rivian plans to offer 135 million shares priced between $72 and $74, up from $57 to $62, it said in an updated securities filing on Friday. At the top end of that current range, and assuming underwriters exercise an option to purchase 20.25 million additional shares, Rivian would be worth more than $65 billion*. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/rivian-raises-ipo-price-range-and-could-now-be-worth-up-to-65-billion.html).
I lost 50% yesterday. Give me a +50% play so I can be break even.
Not gonna lie, The Big Short 2 isn‚Äôt gonna be as good
&gt; Yeah, I'm having issues.
Gonna let it burn out first. Initial pump won't last forever, it's gonna leave behind many bagholders when it dumps. Not worth the risk. As of now Rivian is all hype. You can't buy their products. So there's technically no upside yet. So any pump you see in the stock is purely artificial, created by retail investors buying in, and once they start taking profits the price will correct and most likely plummet below the original IPOs price.

Be careful with coin, Mara and all them crypt [cause it could get nasty](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infrastructure-bill-signed-president-biden-180749171.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHzwALO-Coo5yPts7rRHMkuz33TlriprTX3DwGewRvZ4s0mb7pdfJFWMj6K_piYCgi3PlDjbzZUy7I5QS5ZZp8zf7hdKTKQrN2quTZS3i4qBqHg6D-0XMqLKyxI8L_IXhsfnsJtmwAsozkUf6jhEIJc8xm_8_og2eTpUBfJSbBDl)
Good luck, brother
SPY has the upside of 500 of the best companies in America.

PLTR isn't even in SPY
Rivian tomorrow I thought
Vlad constantly making me poor FFS. Always bad news with HOOD
TSM
I need to open a euro brokerage account.  Sleep is over rated
Who's gonna jump on the Rivian train on IPO?
Bought 8 NVDA $310c before close. Thinking of selling at open and rebuying higher if there‚Äôs an opening drop.
XLNX
Would you rather have dry, cracked hand skin all the time....or....slimy, sweaty hand skin all the time?
Science isn‚Äôt real man
Moderna is going up so it should drag some stragglers with it, that being said, I would not touch OCGN until it gets approved in the US and Canada and even then it might be too late for them to cause a dent in a market dominated by moderna and Pfizer, OCGN should go to 20 eventually but not anytime soon imo.
Big ol OOF ü§≠
Got 17k free should I yolo AMD or NVDA calls?

#Ban Bet Lost

/u/ghostinkansas81 (0/1) made a bet that TSLA would go to 947.7805999999999 when it was 1155.83 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.
I follow this advice. https://www.wired.com/story/stop-telling-kids-theyll-die-from-climate-change/

It won‚Äôt.  The same shit was said in the 80‚Äôs about ‚Äúnuclear war‚Äù.  I‚Äôve watched four grandparents die.  To not have children to support you in your last decade of life is more horrifying than any imagined global catastrophe.
Futures are not Shrek-dick green??? is this even a bull market anymore jeez
you're supposed to do that with iced coffee... duh
NVDA is an unstoppable beast at the moment.
The website says you should be up about 9k
